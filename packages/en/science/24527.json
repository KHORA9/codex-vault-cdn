THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION.\r\n\r\nTO AVOID unwieldiness of bulk this edition of the 'Fragments' is\r\npublished in two volumes, instead of, as heretofore, in one.\r\n\r\nThe first volume deals almost exclusively with the laws and phenomena\r\nof matter.  The second trenches upon questions in which the phenomena\r\nof matter interlace more or less with those of mind.\r\n\r\nNew Essays have been added, while old ones have been revised, and in\r\npart recast. To be clear, without being superficial, has been my aim\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nIn neither volume have I aspired to sit in the seat of the scornful,\r\nbut rather to treat the questions touched upon with a tolerance, if\r\nnot a reverence, befitting their difficulty and weight.\r\n\r\nHolding, as I do, the nebular hypothesis, I am logically bound to\r\ndeduce the life of the world from forces inherent in the nebula.  With\r\nthis view, which is set forth in the second volume, it seemed but fair\r\nto associate the reasons which cause me to conclude that every attempt\r\nmade in our day to generate life independently of antecedent life has\r\nutterly broken down.\r\n\r\nA discourse on the Electric Light winds up the Second volume.  The\r\nincongruity of its position is to be referred to the lateness of its\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nVOL. I. INORGANIC NATURE.\r\n\r\nI. THE CONSTITUTION OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 'Fortnightly Review,' 1865, vol. iii. p. 129.]\r\n\r\nWE cannot think of space as finite, for wherever in imagination we\r\nerect a boundary, we are compelled to think of space as existing\r\nbeyond it.  Thus by the incessant dissolution of limits we arrive at a\r\nmore or less adequate idea of the infinity of space.  But, though\r\ncompelled to think of space as unbounded, there is no mental necessity\r\ncompelling us to think of it either as filled or empty; whether it is\r\nso or not must be decided by experiment and observation.  That it is\r\nnot entirely void, the starry heavens declare; but the question still\r\nremains, Are the stars themselves hung in vacuo?  Are the vast\r\nregions which surround them, and across which their light is\r\npropagated, absolutely empty?  A century ago the answer to this\r\nquestion, founded on the Newtonian theory, would have been, 'No, for\r\nparticles of light are incessantly shot through space.' The reply of\r\nmodern science is also negative, but on different grounds.  It has the\r\nbest possible reasons for rejecting the idea of luminiferous\r\nparticles; but, in support of the conclusion that the celestial spaces\r\nare occupied by matter, it is able to offer proofs almost as cogent as\r\nthose which can be adduced of the existence of an atmosphere round the\r\nearth.  Men's minds, indeed, rose to a conception of the celestial and\r\nuniversal atmosphere through the study of the terrestrial and local\r\none.  From the phenomena of sound, as displayed in the air, they\r\nascended to the phenomena of light, as displayed in the _aether_; which\r\nis the name given to the interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nThe notion of this medium must not be considered as a vague or\r\nfanciful conception on the part of scientific men.  Of its reality\r\nmost of them are as convinced as they are of the existence of the sun\r\nand moon.  The luminiferous aether has definite mechanical properties.\r\nIt is almost infinitely more attenuated than any known gas, but its\r\nproperties are those of a solid rather than of a gas.  It resembles\r\njelly rather than air.  This was not the first conception of the\r\naether, but it is that forced upon us by a more complete knowledge of\r\nits phenomena.  A body thus constituted may have its boundaries; but,\r\nalthough the aether may not be co-extensive with space, it must at all\r\nevents extend as far as the most distant visible stars.  In fact it is\r\nthe vehicle of their light, and without it they could not be seen.\r\nThis all-pervading substance takes up their molecular tremors, and\r\nconveys them with inconceivable rapidity to our organs of vision.  It\r\nis the transported shiver of bodies countless millions of miles\r\ndistant, which translates itself in human consciousness into the\r\nsplendour of the firmament at night.\r\n\r\nIf the aether have a boundary, masses of ponderable matter might be\r\nconceived to exist beyond it, but they could emit no light.  Beyond\r\nthe aether dark suns might burn; there, under proper conditions,\r\ncombustion might be carried on; fuel might consume unseen, and metals\r\nbe fused in invisible fires.  A body, moreover, once heated there,\r\nwould continue for ever heated; a sun or planet once molten, would\r\ncontinue for ever molten.  For, the loss of heat being simply the\r\nabstraction of molecular motion by the aether, where this medium is\r\nabsent no cooling could occur.  A sentient being on approaching a\r\nheated body in this region, would be conscious of no augmentation of\r\ntemperature.  The gradations of warmth dependent on the laws of\r\nradiation would not exist, and actual contact would first reveal the\r\nheat of an extra ethereal sun.\r\n\r\nImagine a paddle-wheel placed in water and caused to rotate.  From it,\r\nas a centre, waves would issue in all directions, and a wader as he\r\napproached the place of disturbance would be met by stronger and\r\nstronger waves.  This gradual augmentation of the impression made upon\r\nthe wader is exactly analogous to the augmentation of light when we\r\napproach a luminous source.  In the one case, however, the coarse\r\ncommon nerves of the body suffice; for the other we must have the\r\nfiner optic nerve.  But suppose the water withdrawn; the action at a\r\ndistance would then cease, and, as far as the sense of touch is\r\nconcerned, the wader would be first rendered conscious of the motion\r\nof the wheel by the blow of the paddles.  The transference of motion\r\nfrom the paddles to the water is mechanically similar to the\r\ntransference of molecular motion from the heated body to the aether;\r\nand the propagation of waves through the liquid is mechanically\r\nsimilar to the propagation of light and radiant heat.\r\n\r\nAs far as our knowledge of space extends, we are to conceive it as the\r\nholder of the luminiferous aether, through which are interspersed, at\r\nenormous distances apart, the ponderous nuclei of the stars.\r\nAssociated with the star that most concerns us we have a group of dark\r\nplanetary masses revolving at various distances round it, each again\r\nrotating on its own axis; and, finally, associated with some of these\r\nplanets we have dark bodies of minor note--the moons.  Whether the\r\nother fixed stars have similar planetary companions or not is to us a\r\nmatter of pure conjecture, which may or may not enter into our\r\nconception of the universe.  But probably every thoughtful person\r\nbelieves, with regard to those distant suns, that there is, in space,\r\nsomething besides our system on which they shine.\r\n\r\nFrom this general view of the present condition of space, and of the\r\nbodies contained in it, we pass to the enquiry whether things were so\r\ncreated at the beginning.  Was space furnished at once, by the fiat of\r\nOmnipotence, with these burning orbs?  In presence of the revelations\r\nof science this view is fading more and more.  Behind the orbs, we now\r\ndiscern the nebulae from which they have been condensed.  And without\r\ngoing so far back as the nebulae, the man of science can prove that\r\nout of common non-luminous matter this whole pomp of stars might have\r\nbeen evolved.\r\n\r\nThe law of gravitation enunciated by Newton is, that every particle of\r\nmatter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force\r\nwhich diminishes as the square of the distance increases.  Thus the\r\nsun and the earth mutually pull each other; thus the earth and the\r\nmoon are kept in company, the force which holds every respective pair\r\nof masses together being the integrated force of their component\r\nparts.  Under the operation of this force a stone falls to the ground\r\nand is warmed by the shock; under its operation meteors plunge into\r\nour atmosphere and rise to incandescence.  Showers of such meteors\r\ndoubtless fall incessantly upon the sun.  Acted on by this force, the\r\nearth, were it stopped in its orbit to-morrow, would rush towards, and\r\nfinally combine with, the sun.  Heat would also be developed by this\r\ncollision.  Mayer first, and Helmholtz and Thomson afterwards, have\r\ncalculated its amount.  It would equal that produced by the combustion\r\nof more than 5,000 worlds of solid coal, all this heat being generated\r\nat the instant of collision.  In the attraction of gravity, therefore,\r\nacting upon non-luminous matter, we have a source of heat more\r\npowerful than could be derived from any terrestrial combustion.  And\r\nwere the matter of the universe thrown in cold detached fragments into\r\nspace, and there abandoned to the mutual gravitation of its own parts,\r\nthe collision of the fragments would in the end produce the fires of\r\nthe stars.\r\n\r\nThe action of gravity upon matter originally cold may, in fact, be the\r\norigin of all light and heat, and also the proximate source of such\r\nother powers as are generated by light and heat.  But we have now to\r\nenquire what is the light and what is the heat thus produced?  This\r\nquestion has already been answered in a general way.  Both light and\r\nheat are modes of motion.  Two planets clash and come to rest; their\r\nmotion, considered as that of masses, is destroyed, but it is in great\r\npart continued as a motion of their ultimate particles.  It is this\r\nlatter motion, taken up by the aether, and propagated through it with\r\na velocity of 186,000 miles a second, that comes to us as the light\r\nand heat of suns and stars.  The atoms of a hot body swing with\r\ninconceivable rapidity--billions of times in a second--but this power\r\nof vibration necessarily implies the operation of forces between the\r\natoms themselves.  It reveals to us that while they are held together\r\nby one force, they are kept asunder by another, their position at any\r\nmoment depending on the equilibrium of attraction and repulsion.  The\r\natoms behave as if connected by elastic springs, which oppose at the\r\nsame time their approach and their retreat, but which tolerate the\r\nvibration called heat.  The molecular vibration once set up is\r\ninstantly shared with the aether, and diffused by it throughout space.\r\n\r\nWe on the earth's surface live night and day in the midst of aethereal\r\ncommotion.  The medium is never still.  The cloud canopy above us may\r\nbe thick enough to shut out the light of the stars; but this canopy is\r\nitself a warm body, which radiates its thermal motion through the\r\naether.  The earth also is warm, and sends its heat-pulses incessantly\r\nforth.  It is the waste of its molecular motion in space that chills\r\nthe earth upon a clear night; it is the return of thermal motion from\r\nthe clouds which prevents the earth's temperature, on a cloudy night,\r\nfrom falling so low.  To the conception of space being filled, we must\r\ntherefore add the conception of its being in a state of incessant\r\ntremor.\r\n\r\nThe sources of this vibration are the ponderable masses of the\r\nuniverse.  Let us take a sample of these and examine it in detail.\r\nWhen we look to our planet, we find it to be an aggregate of solids,\r\nliquids, and gases.  Subjected to a sufficiently low temperature, the\r\ntwo last, would also assume the solid form.  When we look at any one\r\nof these, we generally find it composed of still more elementary\r\nparts.  We learn, for example, that the water of our rivers is formed\r\nby the union, in definite proportions, of two gases, oxygen and\r\nhydrogen.  We know how to bring these constituents together, so as to\r\nform water: we also know how to analyse the water, and recover from it\r\nits two constituents.  So, likewise, as regards the solid portions of\r\nthe earth.  Our chalk hills, for example, are formed by a combination\r\nof carbon, oxygen, and calcium.  These are the so-called elements the\r\nunion of which, in definite proportions, has resulted in the formation\r\nof chalk.  The flints within the chalk we know to be a compound of\r\noxygen and silicium, called silica; and our ordinary clay is, for the\r\nmost part, formed by the union of silicium, oxygen, and the well-known\r\nlight metal, aluminium.  By far the greater portion of the earth's\r\ncrust is compounded of the elementary substances mentioned in these\r\nfew lines.\r\n\r\nThe principle of gravitation has been already described as an\r\nattraction which every particle of matter, however small, exerts on\r\nevery other particle.  With gravity there is no selection; no\r\nparticular atoms choose, by preference, other particular atoms as\r\nobjects of attraction; the attraction of gravitation is proportional\r\nsimply to the quantity of the attracting matter, regardless of its\r\nquality.  But in the molecular world which we have now entered matters\r\nare otherwise arranged.  Here we have atoms between which a strong\r\nattraction is exercised, and also atoms between which a weak\r\nattraction is exercised.  One atom can jostle another out of its place,\r\nin virtue of a superior force of attraction.  But, though the amount\r\nof force exerted varies thus from atom to atom, it is still an\r\nattraction of the same mechanical quality, if I may use the term, as\r\nthat of gravity itself.  Its intensity might be measured in the same\r\nway, namely by the amount of motion which it can generate in a certain\r\ntime.  Thus the attraction of gravity at the earth's surface is\r\nexpressed by the number 32; because, when acting freely on a body for\r\na second of time, gravity imparts to the body a velocity of thirty-two\r\nfeet a second.  In like manner the mutual attraction of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen might be measured by the velocity imparted to the atoms in\r\ntheir rushing together.  Of course such a unit of time as a second is\r\nnot here to be thought of, the whole interval required by the atoms to\r\ncross the minute spaces which separate them amounting only to an\r\ninconceivably small fraction of a second.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that when a body falls to the earth it is warmed by\r\nthe shock.  Here, to use the terminology of Mayer, we have a\r\n_mechanical_ combination of the earth and the body.  Let us suffer the\r\nfalling body and the earth to dwindle in imagination to the size of\r\natoms, and for the attraction of gravity let us substitute that of\r\nchemical affinity; we have then what is called a chemical combination.\r\nThe effect of the union in this case also is the development of heat,\r\nand from the amount of heat generated we can infer the intensity of\r\nthe atomic pull.  Measured by ordinary mechanical standards, this is\r\nenormous.  Mix eight pounds of oxygen with one of hydrogen, and pass a\r\nspark through the mixture; the gases instantly combine, their atoms\r\nrushing over the little distances which separate them.  Take a weight\r\nof 47,000 pounds to an elevation of 1,000 feet above the earth's\r\nsurface, and let it fall; the energy with which it will strike the\r\nearth will not exceed that of the eight pounds of oxygen atoms, as\r\nthey dash against one pound of hydrogen atoms to form water.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes stated that gravity is distinguished from all other\r\nforces by the fact of its resisting conversion into other forms of\r\nforce.  Chemical affinity, it is said, can be converted into heat and\r\nlight, and these again into magnetism and electricity: but gravity\r\nrefuses to be so converted; being a force maintaining itself under all\r\ncircumstances, and not capable of disappearing to give place to\r\nanother.  The statement arises from vagueness of thought.  If by it be\r\nmeant that a particle of matter can never be deprived of its weight,\r\nthe assertion is correct; but the law which affirms the convertibility\r\nof natural forces was never intended, in the minds of those who\r\nunderstood it, to affirm that such a conversion as that here implied\r\noccurs in any case whatever.  As regards convertibility into heat,\r\ngravity and chemical affinity stand on precisely the same footing.\r\nThe attraction in the one case is as indestructible as in the other.\r\nNobody affirms that when a stone rests upon the surface of the earth,\r\nthe mutual attraction of the earth and stone is abolished; nobody\r\nmeans to affirm that the mutual attraction of oxygen for hydrogen\r\nceases, after the atoms have combined to form water.  What is meant,\r\nin the case of chemical affinity, is, that the pull of that affinity,\r\nacting through a certain space, imparts a motion of translation of the\r\none atom towards the other.  This motion is not heat, nor is the force\r\nthat produces it heat.  But when the atoms strike and recoil, the\r\nmotion of translation is converted into a motion of vibration, which\r\nis heat.  The vibration, however, so far from causing the extinction\r\nof the original attraction, is in part carried on by that attraction.\r\nThe atoms recoil, in virtue of the elastic force which opposes actual\r\ncontact, and in the recoil they are driven too far back.  The original\r\nattraction then triumphs over the force of recoil, and urges the atoms\r\nonce more together.  Thus, like a pendulum, they oscillate, until\r\ntheir motion is imparted to the surrounding aether; or, in other\r\nwords, until their heat becomes radiant heat.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, and in this sense only, is chemical affinity converted\r\ninto heat.  There is, first of all, the attraction between the atoms;\r\nthere is, secondly, space between them.  Across this space the\r\nattraction urges them.  They collide, they recoil, they oscillate.\r\nThere is here a change in the form of the motion, but there is no real\r\nloss.  It is so with the attraction of gravity.  To produce motion by\r\ngravity space must also intervene between the attracting bodies.  When\r\nthey strike together motion is apparently destroyed, but in reality\r\nthere is no destruction.  Their atoms are suddenly urged together by\r\nthe shock; by their own perfect elasticity these atoms recoil; and\r\nthus is set up the molecular oscillation which, when communicated to\r\nthe proper nerves, announces itself as heat.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly universally supposed that by the collision of\r\nunelastic bodies force was destroyed.  Men saw, for example, that when\r\ntwo spheres of clay, painter's putty, or lead for example, were urged\r\ntogether, the motion possessed by the masses, prior to impact, was\r\nmore or less annihilated.  They believed in an absolute destruction of\r\nthe force of impact.  Until recent times, indeed, no difficulty was\r\nexperienced in believing this, whereas, at present, the ideas of force\r\nand its destruction refuse to be united in most philosophic minds.  In\r\nthe collision of elastic bodies, on the contrary, it was observed that\r\nthe motion with which they clashed together was in great part restored\r\nby the resiliency of the masses, the more perfect the elasticity the\r\nmore complete being the restitution.  This led to the idea of\r\nperfectly elastic bodies--bodies competent to restore by their recoil\r\nthe whole of the motion which they possessed before impact--and this\r\nagain to the idea of the _conservation_ of force, as opposed to that\r\ndestruction of force which was supposed to occur when unelastic bodies\r\nmet in collision.\r\n\r\nWe now know that the principle of conservation holds equally good with\r\nelastic and unelastic bodies.  Perfectly elastic bodies would develop\r\nno heat on collision.  They would retain their motion afterwards,\r\nthough its direction might be changed; and it is only when sensible\r\nmotion is wholly or partly destroyed, that heat is generated.  This\r\nalways occurs in unelastic collision, the heat developed being the\r\nexact equivalent of the sensible motion extinguished.  This heat\r\nvirtually declares that the property of elasticity, denied to the\r\nmasses, exists among their atoms; by the recoil and oscillation of\r\nwhich the principle of conservation is vindicated.\r\n\r\nBut ambiguity in the use of the term 'force' makes itself more and\r\nmore felt as we proceed.  We have called the attraction of gravity a\r\nforce, without any reference to motion.  A body resting on a shelf is\r\nas much pulled by gravity as when, after having been pushed off the\r\nshelf, it falls towards the earth.  We applied the term force also to\r\nthat molecular attraction which we called chemical affinity.  When,\r\nhowever, we spoke of the conservation of force, in the case of elastic\r\ncollision, we meant neither a pull nor a push, which, as just\r\nindicated, might be exerted upon inert matter, but we meant force\r\ninvested in motion--the _vis viva_, as it is called, of the colliding\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nForce in this form has a definite mechanical measure, in the amount of\r\nwork that it can perform.  The simplest form of work is the raising of\r\na weight.  A man walking up-hill, or up-stairs, with a pound weight in\r\nhis hand, to an elevation say of sixteen feet, performs a certain\r\namount of work, over and above the lifting of his own body.  If he\r\ncarries the pound to a height of thirty-two feet, he does twice the\r\nwork; if to a height of forty-eight feet, he does three times the\r\nwork; if to sixty-four feet, he does four times the work, and so on.\r\nIf, moreover, he carries up two pounds instead of one, other things\r\nbeing equal, he does twice the work; if three, four, or five pounds,\r\nhe does three, four, or five times the work.  In fact, it is plain\r\nthat the work performed depends on two factors, the weight raised and\r\nthe height to which it is raised.  It is expressed by the product of\r\nthese two factors.\r\n\r\nBut a body may be caused to reach a certain elevation in opposition to\r\nthe force of gravity, without being actually carried up.  If a hodman,\r\nfor example, wished to land a brick at an elevation of sixteen feet\r\nabove the place where he stood, he would probably pitch it up to the\r\nbricklayer.  He would thus impart, by a sudden effort, a velocity to\r\nthe brick sufficient to raise it to the required height; the work\r\naccomplished by that effort being precisely the same as if he had\r\nslowly carried up the brick.  The initial velocity to be imparted, in\r\nthis case, is well known.  To reach a height of sixteen feet, the\r\nbrick must quit the man's hand with a velocity of thirty-two feet a\r\nsecond.  It is needless to say, that a body starting with any\r\nvelocity, would, if wholly unopposed or unaided, continue to move for\r\never with the same velocity.  But when, as in the case before us, the\r\nbody is thrown upwards, it moves in opposition to gravity, which\r\nincessantly retards its motion, and finally brings it to rest at an\r\nelevation of sixteen feet.  If not here caught by the bricklayer, it\r\nwould return to the hodman with an accelerated motion, and reach his\r\nhand with the precise velocity it possessed on quitting it.\r\n\r\nAn important relation between velocity and work is here to be pointed\r\nout.  Supposing the hodman competent to impart to the brick, at\r\nstarting, a velocity of sixty-four feet a second, or twice its former\r\nvelocity, would the amount of work performed be twice what it was in\r\nthe first instance?  No; it would be four times that quantity; for a\r\nbody starting with twice the velocity of another, will rise to four\r\ntimes the height.  In like manner, a three-fold velocity will give a\r\nnine-fold elevation, a four-fold velocity will give a sixteen-fold\r\nelevation, and so on.  The height attained, then, is not proportional\r\nto the initial velocity, but to the square of the velocity.  As\r\nbefore, the work is also proportional to the weight elevated.  Hence\r\nthe work which any moving mass whatever is competent to perform, in\r\nvirtue of the motion which it at any moment possesses, is jointly\r\nproportional to its weight and the square of its velocity.  Here,\r\nthen, we have a second measure of work, in which we simply translate\r\nthe idea of height into its equivalent idea of motion.\r\n\r\nIn mechanics, the product of the mass of a moving body into the square\r\nof its velocity, expresses what is called the _vis viva_, or living\r\nforce.  It is also sometimes called the 'mechanical effect.' If, for\r\nexample, a cannon pointed to the zenith urge a ball upwards with twice\r\nthe velocity imparted to a second ball, the former will rise to four\r\ntimes the height attained by the latter.  If directed against a\r\ntarget, it will also do four times the execution.  Hence the\r\nimportance of imparting a high velocity to projectiles in war.  Having\r\nthus cleared our way to a perfectly definite conception of the _vis\r\nviva_ of moving masses, we are prepared for the announcement that the\r\nheat generated by the shock of a falling body against the earth is\r\nproportional to the _vis viva_ annihilated.  The heat is proportional to\r\nthe square of the velocity.  In the case, therefore, of two\r\ncannon-balls of equal weight, if one strike a target with twice the\r\nvelocity of the other, it will generate four times the heat, if with\r\nthree times the velocity, it will generate nine times the heat, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nMr. Joule has shown that a pound weight falling from a height of 772\r\nfeet, or 772 pounds falling through one foot, will generate by its\r\ncollision with the earth an amount of heat sufficient to raise a pound\r\nof water one degree Fahrenheit in temperature.  772 \"foot-pounds\"\r\nconstitute the mechanical equivalent of heat.  Now, a body falling\r\nfrom a height of 772 feet, has, upon striking the earth, a velocity of\r\n223 feet a second; and if this velocity were imparted to the body, by\r\nany other means, the quantity of heat generated by the stoppage of its\r\nmotion would be that stated above.  Six times that velocity, or 1,338\r\nfeet, would not be an inordinate one for a cannon-ball as it quits the\r\ngun.  Hence, a cannon-ball moving with a velocity of 1,338 feet a\r\nsecond, would, by collision, generate an amount of heat competent to\r\nraise its own weight of water 36 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature. If\r\ncomposed of iron, and if all the heat generated were concentrated in\r\nthe ball itself, its temperature would be raised about 360 degrees\r\nFahrenheit; because one degree in the case of water is equivalent to\r\nabout ten degrees in the case of iron.  In artillery practice, the\r\nheat generated is usually concentrated upon the front of the bolt, and\r\non the portion of the target first struck.  By this concentration the\r\nheat developed becomes sufficiently intense to raise the dust of the\r\nmetal to incandescence, a flash of light often accompanying collision\r\nwith the target.\r\n\r\nLet us now fix our attention for a moment on the gunpowder which urges\r\nthe cannon-ball.  This is composed of combustible matter, which if\r\nburnt in the open air would yield a certain amount of heat.  It will\r\nnot yield this amount if it perform the work of urging a ball.  The\r\nheat then generated by the gunpowder will fall short of that produced\r\nin the open air, by an amount equivalent to the _vis viva_ of the ball;\r\nand this exact amount is restored by the ball on its collision with\r\nthe target.  In this perfect way are heat and mechanical motion\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nBroadly enunciated, the principle of the conservation of force\r\nasserts, that the quantity of force in the universe is as unalterable\r\nas the quantity of matter; that it is alike impossible to create force\r\nand to annihilate it.  But in what sense are we to understand this\r\nassertion?  It would be manifestly inapplicable to the force of\r\ngravity as defined by Newton; for this is a force varying inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance; and to affirm the constancy of a varying\r\nforce would be self-contradictory.  Yet, when the question is properly\r\nunderstood, gravity forms no exception to the law of conservation.\r\nFollowing the method pursued by Helmholtz, I will here attempt an\r\nelementary exposition of this law.  Though destined in its\r\napplications to produce momentous changes in human thought, it is not\r\ndifficult of comprehension.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity we will consider a particle of matter,\r\nwhich we may call F, to be perfectly fixed, and a second movable\r\nparticle, D, placed at a distance from F.  We will assume that these\r\ntwo particles attract each other according to the Newtonian law.  At a\r\ncertain distance, the attraction is of a certain definite amount,\r\nwhich might be determined by means of a spring balance.  At half this\r\ndistance the attraction would be augmented four times; at a third of\r\nthe distance, nine times; at one-fourth of the distance, sixteen\r\ntimes, and so on.  In every case, the attraction might be measured by\r\ndetermining, with the spring balance, the amount of tension just\r\nsufficient to prevent D from moving towards F.  Thus far we have\r\nnothing whatever to do with motion; we deal with statics, not with\r\ndynamics.  We simply take into account the _distance_ of D from F, and\r\nthe _pull_ exerted by gravity at that distance.\r\n\r\nIt is customary in mechanics to represent the magnitude of a force by\r\na line of a certain length, a force of double magnitude being\r\nrepresented by a line of double length, and so on.  Placing then the\r\nparticle D at a distance from F, we can, in imagination, draw a\r\nstraight line from D to F, and at D erect a perpendicular to this\r\nline, which shall represent the amount of the attraction exerted on D.\r\nIf D be at a very great distance from F, the attraction will be very\r\nsmall, and the perpendicular consequently very short.  If the distance\r\nbe practically infinite, the attraction is practically _nil_.  Let us\r\nnow suppose at every point in the line joining F and D a perpendicular\r\nto be erected, proportional in length to the attraction exerted at\r\nthat point; we thus obtain an infinite number of perpendiculars, of\r\ngradually increasing length, as D approaches F.  Uniting the ends of\r\nall these perpendiculars, we obtain a curve, and between this curve\r\nand the straight line joining F and D we have an area containing all\r\nthe perpendiculars placed side by side.  Each one of this infinite\r\nseries of perpendiculars representing an attraction, or tension, as it\r\nis sometimes called, the area just referred to represents the sum of\r\nthe tensions exerted upon the particle D, during its passage from its\r\nfirst position to F.\r\n\r\nUp to the present point we have been dealing with tensions, not with\r\nmotion.  Thus far _vis viva_ has been entirely foreign to our\r\ncontemplation of D and F.  Let us now suppose D placed at a\r\npractically infinite distance from F; here, as stated, the pull of\r\ngravity would be infinitely small, and the perpendicular representing\r\nit would dwindle almost to a point.  In this position the sum of the\r\ntensions capable of being exerted on D would be a maximum.  Let D now\r\nbegin to move in obedience to the infinitesimal attraction exerted\r\nupon it.  Motion being once set up, the idea of _vis viva_ arises.  In\r\nmoving towards F the particle D consumes, as it were, the tensions.\r\nLet us fix our attention on D, at any point of the path over which it\r\nis moving.  Between that point and F there is a quantity of unused\r\ntensions; beyond that point the tensions have been all consumed, but\r\nwe have in their place an equivalent quantity of _vis viva_.  After D\r\nhas passed any point, the tension previously in store at that point\r\ndisappears, but not without having added, during the infinitely small\r\nduration of its action, a due amount of motion to that previously\r\npossessed by D.  The nearer D approaches to F, the smaller is the sum\r\nof the tensions remaining, but the greater is the _vis viva_; the\r\nfarther D is from F, the greater is the sum of the unconsumed\r\ntensions, and the less is the living force.  Now the principle of\r\nconservation affirms _not_ the constancy of the value of the tensions of\r\ngravity, nor yet the constancy of the _vis viva_, taken separately, but\r\nthe absolute constancy of the value of both taken together.  At the\r\nbeginning the _vis viva_ was zero, and the tension area was a maximum;\r\nclose to F the _vis viva_ is a maximum, while the tension area is zero.\r\nAt every other point, the work-producing power of the particle D\r\nconsists in part of _vis viva_, and in part of tensions.\r\n\r\nIf gravity, instead of being attraction, were repulsion, then, with\r\nthe particles in contact, the sum of the tensions between D and F\r\nwould be a maximum, and the _vis viva_ zero.  If, in obedience to the\r\nrepulsion, D moved away from F, _vis viva_ would be generated; and the\r\nfarther D retreated from F the greater would be its _vis viva_, and the\r\nless the amount of tension still available for producing motion.\r\nTaking repulsion as well as attraction into account, the principle of\r\nthe conservation of force affirms that the mechanical value of the\r\n_tensions_ and _vires vivae_ of the material universe, so far as we know\r\nit, is a constant quantity.  The universe, in short, possesses two\r\nkinds of property which are mutually convertible.  The diminution of\r\neither carries with it the enhancement of the other, the total value\r\nof the property remaining unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe considerations here applied to gravity apply equally to chemical\r\naffinity.  In a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen the atoms exist apart,\r\nbut by the application of proper means they may be caused to rush\r\ntogether across that space that separates them.  While this space\r\nexists, and as long as the atoms have not begun to move towards each\r\nother, we have tensions and nothing else.  During their motion towards\r\neach other the tensions, as in the case of gravity, are converted into\r\n_vis viva_.  After they clash we have still _vis viva_, but in another\r\nform.  It _was_ translation, it _is_ vibration.  It _was_ molecular\r\ntransfer, it _is_ heat.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to reverse these processes, to unlock the combined\r\natoms and replace them in their first positions.  But, to accomplish\r\nthis, as much heat would be required as was generated by their union.\r\nSuch reversals occur daily and hourly in nature.  By the solar waves,\r\nthe oxygen of water is divorced from its hydrogen in the leaves of\r\nplants.  As molecular _vis viva_ the waves disappear, but in so doing\r\nthey re-endow the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen with tension.  The\r\natoms are thus enabled to recombine, and when they do so they restore\r\nthe precise amount of heat consumed in their separation.  The same\r\nremarks apply to the compound of carbon and oxygen, called carbonic\r\nacid, which is exhaled from our lungs, produced by our fires, and\r\nfound sparingly diffused everywhere throughout the air.  In the leaves\r\nof plants the sunbeams also wrench the atoms of carbonic acid asunder,\r\nand sacrifice themselves in the act; but when the plants are burnt,\r\nthe amount of heat consumed in their production is restored.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the rhythmic play of Nature as regards her forces.\r\nThroughout all her regions she oscillates from tension to _vis viva_,\r\nfrom _vis viva_ to tension.  We have the same play in the planetary\r\nsystem.  The earth's orbit is an ellipse, one of the foci of which is\r\noccupied by the sun.  Imagine the earth at the most distant part of\r\nthe orbit.  Her motion, and consequently her _vis viva_, is then a\r\nminimum.  The planet rounds the curve, and begins its approach to the\r\nsun.  In front it has a store of tensions, which are gradually\r\nconsumed, an equivalent amount of _vis viva_ being generated.  When\r\nnearest to the sun the motion, and consequently the _vis viva_, reach a\r\nmaximum.  But here the available tensions have been used up.  The\r\nearth rounds this portion of the curve and retreats from the sun.\r\nTensions are now stored up, but _vis viva_ is lost, to be again restored\r\nat the expense of the complementary force on the opposite side of the\r\ncurve.  Thus beats the heart of the universe, but without increase or\r\ndiminution of its total stock of force.\r\n\r\nI have thus far tried to steer clear amid confusion, by fixing the\r\nmind of the reader upon things rather than upon names.  But good names\r\nare essential; and here, as yet, we are not provided with such.  We\r\nhave had the force of gravity and living force--two utterly distinct\r\nthings.  We have had pulls and tensions; and we might have had the\r\nforce of heat, the force of light, the force of magnetism, or the\r\nforce of electricity--all of which terms have been employed more or\r\nless loosely by writers on physics.  This confusion is happily avoided\r\nby the introduction of the term 'energy,' which embraces both _tension_\r\nand _vis viva_.  Energy is possessed by bodies already in motion; it is\r\nthen actual, and we agree to call it actual or dynamic energy.  It is\r\nour old _vis viva_.  On the other hand, energy is possible to bodies not\r\nin motion, but which, in virtue of attraction or repulsion, possess a\r\npower of motion which would realise itself if all hindrances were\r\nremoved.  Looking, for example, at gravity; a body on the earth's\r\nsurface in a position from which it cannot fall to a lower one\r\npossesses no energy.  It has neither motion nor power of motion.  But\r\nthe same body suspended at a height above the earth has a power of\r\nmotion, though it may not have exercised it.  Energy is possible to\r\nsuch a body, and we agree to call this potential energy.  It consists\r\nof our old tensions.  We, moreover, speak of the conservation of\r\nenergy, instead of the conservation of force; and say that the sum of\r\nthe potential and dynamic energies of the material universe is a\r\nconstant quantity.\r\n\r\nA body cast upwards consumes the actual energy of projection, and lays\r\nup potential energy.  When it reaches its utmost height all its actual\r\nenergy is consumed, its potential energy being then a maximum.  When\r\nit returns, there is a reconversion of the potential into the actual.\r\nA pendulum at the limit of its swing possesses potential energy; at\r\nthe lowest point of its arc its energy is all actual.  A patch of snow\r\nresting on a mountain slope has potential energy; loosened, and\r\nshooting down as an avalanche, it possesses dynamic energy.  The\r\npine-trees growing on the Alps have potential energy; but rushing down\r\nthe _Holzrinne_ of the woodcutters they possess actual energy.  The same\r\nis true of the mountains themselves.  As long as the rocks which\r\ncompose them can fall to a lower level, they possess potential energy,\r\nwhich is converted into actual when the frost ruptures their cohesion\r\nand hands them over to the action of gravity.  The stone avalanches of\r\nthe Matterhorn and Weisshorn are illustrations in point.  The hammer\r\nof the great bell of Westminster, when raised before striking,\r\npossesses potential energy; when it falls, the energy becomes dynamic;\r\nand after the stroke, we have the rhythmic play of potential and\r\ndynamic in the vibrations of the bell.  The same holds good for the\r\nmolecular oscillations of a heated body.  An atom is driven against\r\nits neighbour, and recoils.  The ultimate amplitude of the recoil\r\nbeing attained, the motion of the atom in that direction is checked,\r\nand for an instant its energy is all potential.  It is then drawn\r\ntowards its neighbour with accelerated speed; thus, by attraction,\r\nconverting its potential into dynamic energy.  Its motion in this\r\ndirection is also finally checked, and again, for an instant, its\r\nenergy is all potential.  It once more retreats, converting, by\r\nrepulsion, its potential into dynamic energy, till the latter attains\r\na maximum, after which it is again changed into potential energy.\r\nThus, what is true of the earth, as she swings to and fro in her\r\nyearly journey round the sun, is also true of her minutest atom.  We\r\nhave wheels within wheels, and rhythm within rhythm.\r\n\r\nWhen a body is heated, a change of molecular arrangement always\r\noccurs, and to produce this change heat is consumed.  Hence, a portion\r\nonly of the heat communicated to the body remains as dynamic energy.\r\nLooking back on some of the statements made at the beginning of this\r\narticle, now that our knowledge is more extensive, we see the\r\nnecessity of qualifying them.  When, for example, two bodies clash,\r\nheat is generated; but the heat, or molecular dynamic energy,\r\ndeveloped at the moment of collision, is not the exact equivalent of\r\nthe sensible dynamic energy destroyed.  The true equivalent is this\r\nheat, plus the potential energy conferred upon the molecules by the\r\nplacing of greater distances between them.  This molecular potential\r\nenergy is afterwards, on the cooling of the body, converted into heat.\r\n\r\nWherever two atoms capable of uniting together by their mutual\r\nattractions exist separately, they form a store of potential energy.\r\nThus our woods, forests, and coal-fields on the one hand, and our\r\natmospheric oxygen on the other, constitute a vast store of energy of\r\nthis kind--vast, but far from infinite.  We have, besides our\r\ncoal-fields, metallic bodies more or less sparsely distributed through\r\nthe earth's crust. These bodies can be oxydised; and hence they are,\r\nso far as they go, stores of energy.  But the attractions of the great\r\nmass of the earth's crust are already satisfied, and from them no\r\nfurther energy can possibly be obtained.  Ages ago the elementary\r\nconstituents of our rocks clashed together and produced the motion of\r\nheat, which was taken up by the aether and carried away through\r\nstellar space.  It is lost for ever as far as we are concerned.  In\r\nthose ages the hot conflict of carbon, oxygen, and calcium produced\r\nthe chalk and limestone hills which are now cold; and from this\r\ncarbon, oxygen, and calcium no further energy can be derived.  So it\r\nis with almost all the other constituents of the earth's crust. They\r\ntook their present form in obedience to molecular force; they turned\r\ntheir potential energy into dynamic, and yielded it as radiant heat to\r\nthe universe, ages before man appeared upon this planet.  For him a\r\nresidue of potential energy remains, vast, truly, in relation to the\r\nlife and wants of an individual, but exceedingly minute in comparison\r\nwith the earth's primitive store.\r\n\r\nTo sum up.  The whole stock of energy or working-power in the world\r\nconsists of attractions, repulsions, and motions.  If the attractions\r\nand repulsions be so circumstanced as to be able to produce motion,\r\nthey are sources of working-power, but not otherwise.  As stated a\r\nmoment ago, the attraction exerted between the earth and a body at a\r\ndistance from the earth's surface, is a source of working-power;\r\nbecause the body can be moved by the attraction, and in falling can\r\nperform work.  When it rests at its lowest level it is not a source of\r\npower or energy, because it can fall no farther.  But though it has\r\nceased to be a source of _energy_, the attraction of gravity still acts\r\nas a _force_, which holds the earth and weight together.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to attracting atoms and molecules.  As long as\r\ndistance separates them, they can move across it in obedience to the\r\nattraction; and the motion thus produced may, by proper appliances, be\r\ncaused to perform mechanical work.  When, for example, two atoms of\r\nhydrogen unite with one of oxygen, to form water, the atoms are first\r\ndrawn towards each other--they move, they clash, and then by virtue of\r\ntheir resiliency, they recoil and quiver.  To this quivering motion we\r\ngive the name of heat.  This atomic vibration is merely the\r\nredistribution of the motion produced by the chemical affinity; and\r\nthis is the only sense in which chemical affinity can be said to be\r\nconverted into heat.  We must not imagine the chemical attraction\r\ndestroyed, or converted into anything else.  For the atoms, when\r\nmutually clasped to form a molecule of water, are held together by the\r\nvery attraction which first drew them towards each other.  That which\r\nhas really been expended is the _pull_ exerted through the space by\r\nwhich the distance between the atoms has been diminished.\r\n\r\nIf this be understood, it will be at once seen that gravity, as before\r\ninsisted on, may, in this sense, be said to be convertible into heat;\r\nthat it is in reality no more an outstanding and inconvertible agent,\r\nas it is sometimes stated to be, than is chemical affinity.  By the\r\nexertion of a certain pull through a certain space, a body is caused\r\nto clash with a certain definite velocity against the earth.  Heat is\r\nthereby developed, and this is the only sense in which gravity can be\r\nsaid to be converted into heat.  In no case is the _force_, which\r\nproduces the motion annihilated or changed into anything else.  The\r\nmutual attraction of the earth and weight exists when they are in\r\ncontact, as when they were separate but the ability of that attraction\r\nto employ itself in the production of motion does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe transformation, in this case, is easily followed by the mind's\r\neye.  First, the weight as a whole is set in motion by the attraction\r\nof gravity.  This motion of the mass is arrested by collision with the\r\nearth, being broken up into molecular tremors, to which we give the\r\nname of heat.\r\n\r\nAnd when we reverse the process, and employ those tremors of heat to\r\nraise a weight--which is done through the intermediation of an elastic\r\nfluid in the steam-engine--a certain definite portion of the molecular\r\nmotion is consumed.  In this sense, and in this sense only, can the\r\nheat be said to be converted into gravity; or, more correctly, into\r\npotential energy of gravity.  Here the destruction of the heat has\r\ncreated no new attraction; but the old attraction has conferred upon\r\nit a power of exerting a certain definite pull, between the\r\nstarting-point of the falling weight and the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, writers on the conservation of energy speak of\r\ntensions being 'consumed' and 'generated,' they do not mean thereby\r\nthat old attractions have been annihilated, and new ones brought into\r\nexistence, but that, in the one case, the power of the attraction to\r\nproduce motion has been diminished by the shortening of the distance\r\nbetween the attracting bodies, while, in the other case, the power of\r\nproducing motion has been augmented by the increase of the distance.\r\nThese remarks apply to all bodies, whether they be sensible masses or\r\nmolecules.\r\n\r\nOf the inner quality that enables matter to attract matter we know\r\nnothing; and the law of conservation makes no statement regarding that\r\nquality.  It takes the facts of attraction as they stand, and affirms\r\nonly the constancy of working-power.  That power may exist in the form\r\nof MOTION; or it may exist in the form of FORCE, _with distance to act\r\nthrough_.  The former is dynamic energy, the latter is potential\r\nenergy, the constancy of the sum of both being affirmed by the law of\r\nconservation.  The convertibility of natural forces consists solely in\r\ntransformations of dynamic into potential, and of potential into\r\ndynamic energy.  In no other sense has the convertibility of force any\r\nscientific meaning.\r\n\r\nGrave errors have been entertained as to what is really intended to be\r\nconserved by the doctrine of conservation.  This exposition I hope\r\nwill tend to remove them.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nII. RADIATION.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The Rede Lecture delivered in the Senate House before the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, May 16, 1865.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n1.  Visible and Invisible Radiation.\r\n\r\nBETWEEN the mind of man and the outer world are interposed the nerves\r\nof the human body, which translate, or enable the mind to translate,\r\nthe impressions of that world into facts of consciousness and thought.\r\n\r\nDifferent nerves are suited to the perception of different\r\nimpressions.  We do not see with the ear, nor hear with the eye, nor\r\nare we rendered sensible of sound by the nerves of the tongue.  Out of\r\nthe general assemblage of physical actions, each nerve, or group of\r\nnerves, selects and responds to those for the perception of which it\r\nis specially organised.\r\n\r\nThe optic nerve passes from the brain to the back of the eyeball and\r\nthere spreads out, to form the retina, a web of nerve filaments, on\r\nwhich the images of external objects are projected by the optical\r\nportion of the eye.  This nerve is limited to the apprehension of the\r\nphenomena of radiation, and, notwithstanding its marvellous\r\nsensibility to certain impressions of this class, it is singularly\r\nobtuse to other impressions.\r\n\r\nNor does the optic nerve embrace the entire range even of radiation.\r\nSome rays, when they reach it, are incompetent to evoke its power,\r\nwhile others never reach it at all, being absorbed by the humours of\r\nthe eye.  To all rays which, whether they reach the retina or not,\r\nfail to excite vision, we give the name of invisible or obscure rays.\r\nAll non-luminous bodies emit such rays.  There is no body in nature\r\nabsolutely cold, and every body not absolutely cold emits rays of\r\nheat.  But to render radiant heat fit to affect the optic nerve a\r\ncertain temperature is necessary.  A cool poker thrust into a fire\r\nremains dark for a time, but when its temperature has become equal to\r\nthat of the surrounding coals, it glows like them.  In like manner, if\r\na current of electricity, of gradually increasing strength, be sent\r\nthrough a wire of the refractory metal platinum, the wire first\r\nbecomes sensibly warm to the touch; for a time its heat augments,\r\nstill however remaining obscure; at length we can no longer touch the\r\nmetal with impunity; and at a certain definite temperature it emits a\r\nfeeble red light.  As the current augments in power the light augments\r\nin brilliancy, until finally the wire appears of a dazzling white. The\r\nlight which it now emits is similar to that of the sun.\r\n\r\nBy means of a prism Sir Isaac Newton unravelled the texture of solar\r\nlight, and by the same simple instrument we can investigate the\r\nluminous changes of our platinum wire.  In passing through the prism\r\nall its rays (and they are infinite in variety) are bent or refracted\r\nfrom their straight course; and, as different rays are differently\r\nrefracted by the prism, we are by it enabled to separate one class of\r\nrays from another.  By such prismatic analysis Dr. Draper has shown,\r\nthat when the platinum wire first begins to glow, the light emitted is\r\nsensibly red.  As the glow augments the red becomes more brilliant,\r\nbut at the same time orange rays are added to the emission. Augmenting\r\nthe temperature still further, yellow rays appear beside the orange;\r\nafter the yellow, green rays are emitted; and after the green come, in\r\nsuccession, blue, indigo, and violet rays.  To display all these\r\ncolours at the same time the platinum wire must be _white-hot_: the\r\nimpression of whiteness being in fact produced by the simultaneous\r\naction of all these colours on the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment just described we began with a platinum wire at an\r\nordinary temperature, and gradually raised it to a white heat.  At the\r\nbeginning, and even before the electric current had acted at all upon\r\nthe wire, it emitted invisible rays.  For some time after the action\r\nof the current had commenced, and even for a time after the wire had\r\nbecome intolerable to the touch, its radiation was still invisible.\r\nThe question now arises, What becomes of these invisible rays when the\r\nvisible ones make their appearance?  It will be proved in the sequel\r\nthat they maintain themselves in the radiation; that a ray once\r\nemitted continues to be emitted when the temperature is increased, and\r\nhence the emission from our platinum wire, even when it has attained\r\nits maximum brilliancy, consists of a mixture of visible and invisible\r\nrays.  If, instead of the platinum wire, the earth itself were raised\r\nto incandescence, the obscure radiation which it now emits would\r\ncontinue to be emitted.  To reach incandescence the planet would have\r\nto pass through all the stages of non-luminous radiation, and the\r\nfinal emission would embrace the rays of all these stages.  There can\r\nhardly be a doubt that from the sun itself, rays proceed similar in\r\nkind to those which the dark earth pours nightly into space.  In fact,\r\nthe various kind of obscure rays emitted by all the planets of our\r\nsystem are included in the present radiation of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe great pioneer in this domain of science was Sir William Herschel.\r\nCausing a beam of solar light to pass through a prism, he resolved it\r\ninto its coloured constituents; he formed what is technically called\r\nthe solar spectrum.  Exposing thermometers to the successive colours\r\nhe determined their heating power, and found it to augment from the\r\nviolet or most refracted end, to the red or least refracted end of the\r\nspectrum.  But he did not stop here.  Pushing his thermometers into\r\nthe dark space beyond the red he found that, though the light had\r\ndisappeared, the radiant heat falling on the instruments was more\r\nintense than that at any visible part of the spectrum.  In fact, Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel showed, and his results have been verified by various\r\nphilosophers since his time, that, besides its luminous rays, the sun\r\npours forth a multitude of other rays, more powerfully calorific than\r\nthe luminous ones, but entirely unsuited to the purposes of vision.\r\n\r\nAt the less refrangible end of the solar spectrum, then, the range of\r\nthe sun's radiation is not limited by that of the eye.  The same\r\nstatement applies to the more refrangible end.  Ritter discovered the\r\nextension of the spectrum into the invisible region beyond the violet;\r\nand, in recent times, this ultra-violet emission has had peculiar\r\ninterest conferred upon it by the admirable researches of Professor\r\nStokes.  The complete spectrum of the sun consists, therefore, of\r\nthree distinct parts: first, of ultra-red rays of high heating power,\r\nbut unsuited to the purposes of vision; secondly, of luminous rays\r\nwhich display the succession of colours, red, orange, yellow, green,\r\nblue, indigo, violet; thirdly, of ultra-violet rays which, like the\r\nultra-red ones, are incompetent to excite vision, but which, unlike\r\nthe ultra-red rays, possess a very feeble heating power.  In\r\nconsequence, however, of their chemical energy these ultra-violet rays\r\nare of the utmost importance to the organic world.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n2.  Origin and Character of Radiation.  The Aether.\r\n\r\nWhen we see a platinum wire raised gradually to a white heat, and\r\nemitting in succession all the colours of the spectrum, we are simply\r\nconscious of a series of changes in the condition of our own eyes.  We\r\ndo not see the actions in which these successive colours originate,\r\nbut the mind irresistibly infers that the appearance of the colours\r\ncorresponds to certain contemporaneous changes in the wire.  What is\r\nthe nature of these changes?  In virtue of what condition does the\r\nwire radiate at all?  We must now look from the wire, as a whole, to\r\nits constituent atoms.  Could we see those atoms, even before the\r\nelectric current has begun to act upon them, we should find them in a\r\nstate of vibration.  In this vibration, indeed, consists such warmth\r\nas the wire then possesses.  Locke enunciated this idea with great\r\nprecision, and it has been placed beyond the pale of doubt by the\r\nexcellent quantitative researches of Mr. Joule.  'Heat,' says Locke,\r\n'is a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of the object,\r\nwhich produce in us that sensation from which we denominate the object\r\nhot: so what in our sensations is _heat_ in the object is nothing but\r\n_motion_.' When the electric current, still feeble, begins to pass\r\nthrough the wire, its first act is to intensify the vibrations already\r\nexisting, by causing the atoms to swing through wider ranges.\r\nTechnically speaking, the _amplitudes_ of the oscillations are\r\nincreased.  The current does this, however, without altering the\r\nperiods of the old vibrations, or the times in which they were\r\nexecuted.  But besides intensifying the old vibrations the current\r\ngenerates new and more rapid ones, and when a certain definite\r\nrapidity has been attained, the wire begins to glow.  The colour first\r\nexhibited is red, which corresponds to the lowest rate of vibration of\r\nwhich the eye is able to take cognisance.  By augmenting the strength\r\nof the electric current more rapid vibrations are introduced, and\r\norange rays appear.  A quicker rate of vibration produces yellow, a\r\nstill quicker green; and by further augmenting the rapidity, we pass\r\nthrough blue, indigo, and violet, to the extreme ultra-violet rays.\r\n\r\nSuch are the changes recognised by the mind in the wire itself, as\r\nconcurrent with the visual changes taking place in the eye.  But what\r\nconnects the wire with this organ? By what means does it send such\r\nintelligence of its varying condition to the optic nerve?  Heat being\r\nas defined by Locke, 'a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts\r\nof an object,' it is readily conceivable that on touching a heated\r\nbody the agitation may communicate itself to the adjacent nerves, and\r\nannounce itself to them as light or heat.  But the optic nerve does\r\nnot touch the hot platinum, and hence the pertinence of the question,\r\nBy what agency are the vibrations of the wire transmitted to the eye?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question involves one of the most important\r\nphysical conceptions that the mind of man has yet achieved: the\r\nconception of a medium filling space and fitted mechanically for the\r\ntransmission of the vibrations of light and heat, as air is fitted for\r\nthe transmission of sound.  This medium is called the _luminiferous\r\naether_.  Every vibration of every atom of our platinum wire raises in\r\nthis aether a wave, which speeds through it at the rate of 186,000\r\nmiles a second.\r\n\r\nThe aether suffers no rupture of continuity at the surface of the eye,\r\nthe inter-molecular spaces of the various humours are filled with it;\r\nhence the waves generated by the glowing platinum can cross these\r\nhumours and impinge on the optic nerve at the back of the eye.\r\n[Footnote: The action here described is analogous to the passage of\r\nsound-waves through thick felt whose interstices are occupied by air.]\r\nThus the sensation of light reduces itself to the acceptance of\r\nmotion.  Up to this point we deal with pure mechanics; but the\r\nsubsequent translation of the shock of the aethereal waves into\r\nconsciousness eludes mechanical science.  As an oar dipping into the\r\nCam generates systems of waves, which, speeding from the centre of\r\ndisturbance, finally stir the sedges on the river's bank, so do the\r\nvibrating atoms generate in the surrounding aether undulations, which\r\nfinally stir the filaments of the retina.  The motion thus imparted is\r\ntransmitted with measurable, and not very great velocity to the brain,\r\nwhere, by a process which the science of mechanics does not even tend\r\nto unravel, the tremor of the nervous matter is converted into the\r\nconscious impression of light.\r\n\r\nDarkness might then be defined as aether at rest; light as aether in\r\nmotion.  But in reality the aether is never at rest, for in the\r\nabsence of light-waves we have heat-waves always speeding through it.\r\nIn the spaces of the universe both classes of undulations incessantly\r\ncommingle.  Here the waves issuing from uncounted centres cross,\r\ncoincide, oppose, and pass through each other, without confusion or\r\nultimate extinction.  Every star is seen across the entanglement of\r\nwave-motions produced by all other stars.  It is the ceaseless thrill\r\ncaused by those distant orbs collectively in the aether, that\r\nconstitutes what we call the 'temperature of space.' As the air of a\r\nroom accommodates itself to the requirements of an orchestra,\r\ntransmitting each vibration of every pipe and string, so does the\r\ninter-stellar aether accommodate itself to the requirements of light\r\nand heat.  Its waves mingle in space without disorder, each being\r\nendowed with an individuality as indestructible as if it alone had\r\ndisturbed the universal repose.\r\n\r\nAll vagueness with regard to the use of the terms 'radiation' and\r\n'absorption' will now disappear.  Radiation is the communication of\r\nvibratory motion to the aether; and when a body is said to be chilled\r\nby radiation, as for example the grass of a meadow on a starlight\r\nnight, the meaning is, that the molecules of the grass have lost a\r\nportion of their motion, by imparting it to the medium in which they\r\nvibrate.  On the other hand, the waves of aether may so strike against\r\nthe molecules of a body exposed to their action as to yield up their\r\nmotion to the latter; and in this transfer of the motion from the\r\naether to the molecules consists the absorption of radiant heat.  All\r\nthe phenomena of heat are in this way reducible to interchanges of\r\nmotion; and it is purely as the recipients or the donors of this\r\nmotion, that we ourselves become conscious of the action of heat and\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n3.  The Atomic Theory in reference to the Aether.\r\n\r\nThe word 'atoms' has been more than once employed in this discourse.\r\nChemists have taught us that all matter is reducible to certain\r\nelementary forms to which they give this name.  These atoms are\r\nendowed with powers of mutual attraction, and under suitable\r\ncircumstances they coalesce to form compounds.  Thus oxygen and\r\nhydrogen are elements when separate, or merely _mixed_, but they may be\r\nmade to _combine_ so as to form molecules, each consisting of two atoms\r\nof hydrogen and one of oxygen.  In this condition they constitute\r\nwater.  So also chlorine and sodium are elements, the former a pungent\r\ngas, the latter a soft metal; and they unite together to form chloride\r\nof sodium or common salt.  In the same way the element nitrogen\r\ncombines with hydrogen, in the proportion of one atom of the former to\r\nthree of the latter, to form ammonia.  Picturing in imagination the\r\natoms of elementary bodies as little spheres, the molecules of\r\ncompound bodies must be pictured as groups of such spheres.  This is\r\nthe atomic theory as Dalton conceived it.  Now if this theory have any\r\nfoundation in fact, and if the theory of an aether pervading space,\r\nand constituting the vehicle of atomic motion, be founded in fact, it\r\nis surely of interest to examine whether the vibrations of elementary\r\nbodies are modified by the act of combination--whether as regards\r\nradiation and absorption, or, in other words, whether as regards the\r\ncommunication of motion to the aether, and the acceptance of motion\r\nfrom it, the deportment of the uncombined atoms will be different from\r\nthat of the combined.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n4.  Absorption of Radiant Heat by Gases.\r\n\r\nWe have now to submit these considerations to the only test by which\r\nthey can be tried, namely, that of experiment.  An experiment is well\r\ndefined as a question put to Nature; but, to avoid the risk of asking\r\namiss, we ought to purify the question from all adjuncts which do not\r\nnecessarily belong to it.  Matter has been shown to be composed of\r\nelementary constituents, by the compounding of which all its varieties\r\nare produced.  But, besides the chemical unions which they form, both\r\nelementary and compound bodies can unite in another and less intimate\r\nway.  Gases and vapours aggregate to liquids and solids, without any\r\nchange of their chemical nature.  We do not yet know how the\r\ntransmission of radiant heat may be affected by the entanglement due\r\nto cohesion; and, as our object now is to examine the influence of\r\nchemical union alone, we shall render our experiments more pure by\r\nliberating the atoms and molecules entirely from the bonds of\r\ncohesion, and employing them in the gaseous or vaporous form.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavour to obtain a perfectly clear mental image of the\r\nproblem now before us.  Limiting in the first place our enquiries to\r\nthe phenomena of absorption, we have to picture a succession of waves\r\nissuing from a radiant source and passing through a gas; some of them\r\nstriking against the gaseous molecules and yielding up their motion to\r\nthe latter; others gliding round the molecules, or passing through the\r\nintermolecular spaces without apparent hindrance.  The problem before\r\nus is to determine whether such free molecules have any power whatever\r\nto stop the waves of heat; and if so, whether different molecules\r\npossess this power in different degrees.\r\n\r\nIn examining the problem let us fall back upon an actual piece of\r\nwork, choosing as the source of our heat-waves a plate of copper,\r\nagainst the back of which a steady sheet of flame is permitted to\r\nplay.  On emerging from the copper, the waves, in the first instance,\r\npass through a space devoid of air, and then enter a hollow glass\r\ncylinder, three feet long and three inches wide.  The two ends of this\r\ncylinder are stopped by two plates of rock-salt, a solid substance\r\nwhich offers a scarcely sensible obstacle to the passage of the\r\ncalorific waves.  After passing through the tube, the radiant heat\r\nfalls upon the anterior face of a thermo-electric pile, [Footnote: In\r\nthe Appendix to the first chapter of 'Heat as a Mode of Motion,' the\r\nconstruction of the thermo-electric pile is fully explained.] which\r\ninstantly converts the heat into an electric current.  This current\r\nconducted round a magnetic needle deflects it, and the magnitude of\r\nthe deflection is a measure of the heat falling upon the pile.  This\r\nfamous instrument, and not an ordinary thermometer, is what we shall\r\nuse in these enquiries, but we shall use it in a somewhat novel way.\r\nAs long as the two opposite faces of the thermo-electric pile are kept\r\nat the same temperature, no matter how high that may be, there is no\r\ncurrent generated.  The current is a consequence of a difference of\r\ntemperature between the two opposite faces of the pile.  Hence, if\r\nafter the anterior face has received the heat from our radiating\r\nsource, a second source, which we may call the compensating source, be\r\npermitted to radiate against the posterior face, this latter radiation\r\nwill tend to neutralise the former.  When the neutralisation is\r\nperfect, the magnetic needle connected with the pile is no longer\r\ndeflected, but points to the zero of the graduated circle over which\r\nit hangs.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us suppose the glass tube, through which the waves from\r\nthe heated plate of copper are passing, to be exhausted by an\r\nair-pump, the two sources of heat acting at the same time on the two\r\nopposite faces of the pile.  When by means of an adjusting screen,\r\nperfectly equal quantities of heat are imparted to the two faces, the\r\nneedle points to zero.  Let any gas be now permitted to enter the\r\nexhausted tube; if its molecules possess any power of intercepting the\r\ncalorific waves, the equilibrium previously existing will be\r\ndestroyed, the compensating source will triumph, and a deflection of\r\nthe magnetic needle will be the immediate consequence.  From the\r\ndeflections thus produced by different gases, we can readily deduce\r\nthe relative amounts of wave-motion which their molecules intercept.\r\n\r\nIn this way the substances mentioned in the following table were\r\nexamined, a small portion only of each being admitted into the glass\r\ntube.  The quantity admitted in each case was just sufficient to\r\ndepress a column of mercury associated with the tube one inch: in\r\nother words, the gases were examined at a pressure of one-thirtieth of\r\nan atmosphere.  The numbers in the table express the relative amounts\r\nof wave-motion absorbed by the respective gases, the quantity\r\nintercepted by air being taken as unity.\r\n\r\nRadiation through Gases.\r\n\r\nName of gas      Relative absorption\r\n\r\nAir                        1\r\n\r\nOxygen                     1\r\n\r\nNitrogen                   1\r\n\r\nHydrogen                   1\r\n\r\nCarbonic oxide           750\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid            972\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid.     1,005\r\n\r\nNitric oxide           1,590\r\n\r\nNitrous oxide          1,860\r\n\r\nSulphide of hydrogen   2,100\r\n\r\nAmmonia                5,460\r\n\r\nOlefiant gas           6,030\r\n\r\nSulphurous acid        6,480\r\n\r\nEvery gas in this table is perfectly transparent to light, that is to\r\nsay, all waves within the limits of the visible spectrum pass through\r\nit without obstruction; but for the waves of slower period, emanating\r\nfrom our heated plate of copper, enormous differences of absorptive\r\npower are manifested.  These differences illustrate in the most\r\nunexpected manner the influence of chemical combination.  Thus the\r\nelementary gases, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, and the mixture\r\natmospheric air, prove to be practical vacua to the rays of heat; for\r\nevery ray, or, more strictly speaking, for every unit of wave-motion,\r\nwhich any one of them intercepts, perfectly transparent ammonia\r\nintercepts 5,460 units, olefiant gas 6,030 units, while sulphurous\r\nacid gas absorbs 6,480 units.  What, becomes of the wave-motion thus\r\nintercepted?  It is applied to the heating of the absorbing gas.\r\nThrough air, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, the waves of aether pass\r\nwithout absorption, and these gases are not sensibly changed in\r\ntemperature by the most powerful calorific rays.  The position of\r\nnitrous oxide in the foregoing table is worthy of particular notice.\r\nIn this gas we have the same atoms in a state of chemical union, that\r\nexist uncombined in the atmosphere; but the absorption of the compound\r\nis 1,800 times that of air.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n5.  Formation of Invisible Foci.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary deportment of the elementary gases naturally\r\ndirected attention to elementary bodies in other states of\r\naggregation.  Some of Melloni's results now attained a new\r\nsignificance.  This celebrated experimenter had found crystals of\r\nsulphur to be highly pervious to radiant heat; he had also proved that\r\nlamp-black, and black glass, (which owes its blackness to the element\r\ncarbon) were to a considerable extent transparent to calorific rays of\r\nlow refrangibility.  These facts, harmonising so strikingly with the\r\ndeportment of the simple gases, suggested further enquiry.  Sulphur\r\ndissolved in bisulphide of carbon was found almost perfectly\r\ndiathermic.  The dense and deeply-coloured element bromine was\r\nexamined, and found competent to cut off the light of our most\r\nbrilliant flames, while it transmitted the invisible calorific rays\r\nwith extreme freedom.  Iodine, the companion element of bromine, was\r\nnext thought of, but it was found impracticable to examine the\r\nsubstance in its usual solid condition.  It however dissolves freely\r\nin bisulphide of carbon.  There is no chemical union between the\r\nliquid and the iodine; it is simply a case of solution, in which the\r\nuncombined atoms of the element can act upon the radiant heat.  When\r\npermitted to do so, it was found that a layer of dissolved iodine,\r\nsufficiently opaque to cut off the light of the midday sun, was almost\r\nabsolutely transparent to the invisible calorific rays. [Footnote:\r\nProfessor Dewar has recently succeeded in producing a medium highly\r\nopaque to light, and highly transparent to obscure heat, by fusing\r\ntogether sulphur and iodine.]\r\n\r\nBy prismatic analysis Sir William Herschel separated the luminous from\r\nthe non-luminous rays of the sun, and he also sought to render the\r\nobscure rays visible by concentration.  Intercepting the luminous\r\nportion of his spectrum he brought, by a converging lens, the\r\nultra-red rays to a focus, but by this condensation he obtained no\r\nlight.  The solution of iodine offers a means of filtering the solar\r\nbeam, or failing it, the beam of the electric lamp, which renders\r\nattainable far more powerful foci of invisible rays than could\r\npossibly be obtained by the method of Sir William Herschel.  For to\r\nform his spectrum he was obliged to operate upon solar light which had\r\npassed through a narrow slit or through a small aperture, the amount\r\nof the obscure heat being limited by this circumstance.  But with our\r\nopaque solution we may employ the entire surface of the largest lens,\r\nand having thus converged the rays, luminous and non-luminous, we can\r\nintercept the former by the iodine, and do what we please with the\r\nlatter.  Experiments of this character, not only with the iodine\r\nsolution, but also with black glass and layers of lampblack, were\r\npublicly performed at the Royal Institution in the early part of 1862,\r\nand the effects at the foci of invisible rays, then obtained, were\r\nsuch as had never been witnessed previously.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments here referred to, glass lenses were employed to\r\nconcentrate the rays.  But glass, though highly transparent to the\r\nluminous, is in a high degree opaque to the invisible, heat-rays of\r\nthe electric lamp, and hence a large portion of those rays was\r\nintercepted by the glass.  The obvious remedy here is to employ\r\nrock-salt lenses instead of glass ones, or to abandon the use of\r\nlenses wholly, and to concentrate the rays by a metallic mirror.  Both\r\nof these improvements have been introduced, and, as anticipated, the\r\ninvisible foci have been thereby rendered more intense.  The mode of\r\noperating remains however the same, in principle, as that made known\r\nin 1862.  It was then found that an instant's exposure of the face of\r\nthe thermoelectric pile to the focus of invisible rays, dashed the\r\nneedles of a coarse galvanometer violently aside.  It is now found\r\nthat on substituting for the face of the thermo-electric pile a\r\ncombustible body, the invisible rays are competent to set that body on\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n6.  Visible and Invisible Rays of the Electric Light.\r\n\r\nWe have next to examine what proportion the non-luminous rays of the\r\nelectric light bear to the luminous ones.  This the opaque solution of\r\niodine enables us to do with an extremely close approximation to the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe pure bisulphide of carbon, which is the solvent of the iodine, is\r\nperfectly transparent to the luminous, and almost perfectly\r\ntransparent to the dark, rays of the electric lamp.  Supposing the\r\ntotal radiation of the lamp to pass through the transparent\r\nbisulphide, while through the solution of iodine only the dark rays\r\nare transmitted.  If we determine, by means of a thermoelectric pile,\r\nthe total radiation, and deduct from it the purely obscure, we obtain\r\nthe value of the purely luminous emission.  Experiments, performed in\r\nthis way, prove that if all the visible rays of the electric light\r\nwere converged to a focus of dazzling brilliancy, its heat would only\r\nbe one-eighth of that produced at the unseen focus of the invisible\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nExposing his thermometers to the successive colours of the solar\r\nspectrum, Sir William Herschel determined the heating power of each,\r\nand also that of the region beyond the extreme red.  Then drawing a\r\nstraight line to represent the length of the spectrum, he erected, at\r\nvarious points, perpendiculars to represent the calorific intensity\r\nexisting at those points.  Uniting the ends of all his perpendiculars,\r\nhe obtained a curve which showed at a glance the manner in which the\r\nheat was distributed in the solar spectrum.  Professor Müller of\r\nFreiburg, with improved instruments, afterwards made similar\r\nexperiments, and constructed a more accurate diagram of the same kind.\r\nWe have now to examine the distribution of heat in the spectrum of the\r\nelectric light; and for this purpose we shall employ a particular form\r\nof the thermo-electric pile, devised by Melloni.  Its face is a\r\nrectangle, which by means of movable side-pieces can be rendered as\r\nnarrow as desired.  We can, for example, have the face of the pile the\r\ntenth, the hundredth, or even the thousandth of an inch in breadth. By\r\nmeans of an endless screw, this linear thermo-electric pile may be\r\nmoved through the entire spectrum, from the violet to the red, the\r\namount of heat falling upon the pile at every point of its march,\r\nbeing declared by a magnetic needle associated with the pile.\r\n\r\nWhen this instrument is brought up to the violet end of the spectrum\r\nof the electric light, the heat is found to be insensible.  As the\r\npile is gradually moved from the violet end towards the red, heat soon\r\nmanifests itself, augmenting as we approach the red.  Of all the\r\ncolours of the visible spectrum the red possesses the highest heating\r\npower.  On pushing the pile into the dark region beyond the red, the\r\nheat, instead of vanishing, rises suddenly and enormously in\r\nintensity, until at some distance beyond the red it attains a maximum.\r\nMoving the pile still forward, the thermal power falls, somewhat more\r\nrapidly than it rose.  It then gradually shades away, but, for a\r\ndistance beyond the red greater than the length of the whole visible\r\nspectrum, signs of heat may be detected.\r\n\r\nDrawing a datum line, and erecting along it perpendiculars,\r\nproportional in length to the thermal intensity at the respective\r\npoints, we obtain the extraordinary curve, shown on the opposite page,\r\nwhich exhibits the distribution of heat in the spectrum of the\r\nelectric light.  In the region of dark rays, beyond the red, the curve\r\nshoots up to B, in a steep and massive peak--a kind of Matterhorn of\r\nheat, which dwarfs the portion of the diagram C D E, representing the\r\nluminous radiation.  Indeed the idea forced upon the mind by this\r\ndiagram is that the light rays are a mere insignificant appendage to\r\nthe heat-rays represented by the area A B C D, thrown in as it were by\r\nnature for the purpose of vision.\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Spectrum of Electric Light\r\n\r\nThe diagram drawn by Professor Müller to represent the distribution of\r\nheat in the solar spectrum is not by any means so striking as that\r\njust described, and the reason, doubtless, is that prior to reaching\r\nthe earth the solar rays have to traverse our atmosphere.  By the\r\naqueous vapour there diffused, the summit of the peak representing the\r\nsun's invisible radiation is cut off.  A similar lowering of the\r\nmountain of invisible heat is observed when the rays from the electric\r\nlight are permitted to pass through a film of water, which acts upon\r\nthem as the atmospheric vapour acts upon the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n7.  Combustion by Invisible Rays.\r\n\r\nThe sun's invisible rays far transcend the visible ones in heating\r\npower, so that if the alleged performances of Archimedes during the\r\nsiege of Syracuse had any foundation in fact, the dark solar rays\r\nwould have been the philosopher's chief agents of combustion.  On a\r\nsmall scale we can readily produce, with the purely invisible rays of\r\nthe electric light, all that Archimedes is said to have performed with\r\nthe sun's total radiation.  Placing behind the electric light a small\r\nconcave mirror, the rays are converged, the cone of reflected rays and\r\ntheir point of convergence being rendered clearly visible by the dust\r\nalways floating in the air.  Placing between the luminous focus and\r\nthe source of rays our solution of iodine, the light of the cone is\r\nentirely cut away; but the intolerable heat experienced when the band\r\nis placed, even for a moment, at the dark focus, shows that the\r\ncalorific rays pass unimpeded through the opaque solution.\r\n\r\nAlmost anything that ordinary fire can effect may be accomplished at\r\nthe focus of invisible rays; the air at the focus remaining at the\r\nsame time perfectly cold, on account of its transparency to the\r\nheat-rays.  An air thermometer, with a hollow rack-salt bulb, would be\r\nunaffected by the heat of the focus: there would be no expansion, and\r\nin the open air there is no convection.  The aether at the focus, and\r\nnot the air, is the substance in which the heat is embodied.  A block\r\nof wood, placed at the focus, absorbs the heat, and dense volumes of\r\nsmoke rise swiftly upwards, showing the manner in which the air itself\r\nwould rise, if the invisible rays were competent to heat it.  At the\r\nperfectly dark focus dry paper is instantly inflamed: chips of wood\r\nare speedily burnt up: lead, tin, and zinc are fused: and disks of\r\ncharred paper are raised to vivid incandescence.  It might be supposed\r\nthat the obscure rays would show no preference for black over white;\r\nbut they do show a preference, and to obtain rapid combustion, the\r\nbody, if not already black, ought to be blackened.  When metals are to\r\nbe burned, it is necessary to blacken or otherwise tarnish them, so as\r\nto diminish their reflective power.  Blackened zinc foil, when brought\r\ninto the focus of invisible rays, is instantly caused to blaze, and\r\nburns with its peculiar purple light.  Magnesium wire flattened, or\r\ntarnished magnesium ribbon, also bursts into flame.  Pieces of\r\ncharcoal suspended in a receiver full of oxygen are also set on fire\r\nwhen the invisible focus falls upon them; the dark rays after having\r\npassed through the receiver, still possessing sufficient power to\r\nignite the charcoal, and thus initiate the attack of the oxygen.  If,\r\ninstead of being plunged in oxygen, the charcoal be suspended in\r\nvacuo, it immediately glows at the place where the focus falls.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n8.  Transmutation of Rays: Calorescence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: I borrow this term from Professor Challis, 'Philosophical\r\nMagazine,' vol. xii. P. 521]\r\n\r\nEminent experimenters were long occupied in demonstrating the\r\nsubstantial identity of light and radiant heat, and we have now the\r\nmeans of offering a new and striking proof of this identity.  A\r\nconcave mirror produces, beyond the object which it reflects, an\r\ninverted and magnified image of the object.  Withdrawing, for example,\r\nour iodine solution, an intensely luminous inverted image of the\r\ncarbon points of the electric light is formed at the focus of the\r\nmirror employed in the foregoing experiments.  When the solution is\r\ninterposed, and the light is cut away, what becomes of this image?  It\r\ndisappears from sight; but an invisible thermograph remains, and it is\r\nonly the peculiar constitution of our eyes that disqualifies us from\r\nseeing the picture formed by the calorific rays.  Falling on white\r\npaper, the image chars itself out: falling on black paper, two holes\r\nare pierced in it, corresponding to the images of the two coke points:\r\nbut falling on a thin plate of carbon in vacuo, or upon a thin sheet\r\nof platinised platinum, either in vacuo or in air, radiant heat is\r\nconverted into light, and the image stamps itself in vivid\r\nincandescence upon both the carbon and the metal.  Results similar to\r\nthose obtained with the electric light have also been obtained with\r\nthe invisible rays of the lime-light and of the sun.\r\n\r\nBefore a Cambridge audience it is hardly necessary to refer to the\r\nexcellent researches of Professor Stokes at the opposite end of the\r\nspectrum.  The above results constitute a kind of complement to his\r\ndiscoveries.  Professor Stokes named the phenomena which he has\r\ndiscovered and investigated _Fluorescence_; for the new phenomena here\r\ndescribed I have proposed the term _Calorescence_.  He, by the\r\ninterposition of a proper medium, so lowered the refrangibility of the\r\nultraviolet rays of the spectrum as to render them visible.  Here, by\r\nthe interposition of the platinum foil, the refrangibility of the\r\nultra-red rays is so exalted as to render them visible.  Looking\r\nthrough a prism at the incandescent image of the carbon points, the\r\nlight of the image is decomposed, and a complete spectrum is obtained.\r\nThe invisible rays of the electric light, remoulded by the atoms of\r\nthe platinum, shine thus visibly forth; ultra-red rays being converted\r\ninto red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, and ultraviolet\r\nones.  Could we, moreover, raise the original source of rays to a\r\nsufficiently high temperature, we might not only obtain from the dark\r\nrays of such a source a single incandescent image, but from the dark\r\nrays of this image we might obtain a second one, from the dark rays of\r\nthe second a third, and so on--a series of complete images and spectra\r\nbeing thus extracted from the invisible emission of the primitive\r\nsource. [Footnote: On investigating the calorescence produced by rays\r\ntransmitted through glasses of various colours, it was found that in\r\nthe case of certain specimens of blue glass, the platinum foil glowed\r\nwith a pink or purplish light.  The effect was not subjective, and\r\nconsiderations of obvious interest are suggested by it.  Different\r\nkinds of black glass differ notably as to their power of transmitting\r\nradiant heat.  When thin, some descriptions tint the sun with a\r\ngreenish hue: others make it appear a glowing red without any trace of\r\ngreen.  The latter are far more diathermic than the former.  In fact,\r\ncarbon when perfectly dissolved and incorporated with a good white\r\nglass, is highly transparent to the calorific rays, and by employing\r\nit as an absorbent the phenomena of 'calorescence' may be obtained,\r\nthough in a less striking form than with the iodine.  The black glass\r\nchosen for thermometers, and intended to absorb completely the solar\r\nheat, may entirely fail in this object, if the glass in which the\r\ncarbon is incorporated be colourless.  To render the bulb of a\r\nthermometer a perfect absorbent, the glass ought in the first instance\r\nto be green.  Soon after the discovery of fluorescence the late Dr.\r\nWilliam Allen Miller pointed to the lime-light as an illustration of\r\nexalted refrangibility.  Direct experiments have since entirely\r\nconfirmed the view expressed at page 210 of his work on 'Chemistry,'\r\npublished in 1855.]\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n9.  Deadness of the Optic Nerve to the Calorific Rays.\r\n\r\nThe layer of iodine used in the foregoing experiments intercepted the\r\nrays of the noonday sun.  No trace of light from the electric lamp was\r\nvisible in the darkest room, even when a white screen was placed at\r\nthe focus of the mirror employed to concentrate the light.  It was\r\nthought, however, that if the retina itself were brought into the\r\nfocus the sensation of light might be experienced.  The danger of this\r\nexperiment was twofold.  If the dark rays were absorbed in a high\r\ndegree by the humours of the eye the albumen of the humours might\r\ncoagulate along the line of the rays.  If, on the contrary, no such\r\nhigh absorption took place, the rays might reach the retina with a\r\nforce sufficient to destroy it.  To test the likelihood of these\r\nresults, experiments were made on water and on a solution of alum, and\r\nthey showed it to be very improbable that in the brief time requisite\r\nfor an experiment any serious damage could be done.  The eye was\r\ntherefore caused to approach the dark focus, no defence, in the first\r\ninstance, being provided; but the heat, acting upon the parts\r\nsurrounding the pupil, could not be borne.  An aperture was therefore\r\npierced in a plate of metal, and the eye, placed behind the aperture,\r\nwas caused to approach the point of convergence of invisible rays. The\r\nfocus was attained, first by the pupil and afterwards by the retina.\r\nRemoving the eye, but permitting the plate of metal to remain, a sheet\r\nof platinum foil was placed in the position occupied by the retina a\r\nmoment before.  The platinum became red-hot.  No sensible damage was\r\ndone to the eye by this experiment; no impression of light was\r\nproduced; the optic nerve was not even conscious of heat.\r\n\r\nBut the humours of the eye are known to be highly impervious to the\r\ninvisible calorific rays, and the question therefore arises, 'Did the\r\nradiation in the foregoing experiment reach the retina at all?'  The\r\nanswer is, that the rays were in part transmitted to the retina, and\r\nin part absorbed by the humours.  Experiments on the eye of an ox\r\nshowed that the proportion of obscure rays which reached the retina\r\namounted to 18 per cent.  of the total radiation; while the luminous\r\nemission from the electric light amounts to no more than 10 per cent.\r\nof the same total.  Were the purely luminous rays of the electric lamp\r\nconverged by our mirror to a focus, there can be no doubt as to the\r\nfate of a retina placed there.  Its ruin would be inevitable; and yet\r\nthis would be accomplished by an amount of wave-motion but little more\r\nthan half of that which the retina, without exciting consciousness,\r\nbears at the focus of invisible rays.\r\n\r\nThis subject will repay a moment's further attention.  At a common\r\ndistance of a foot the visible radiation of the electric light\r\nemployed in these experiments is 800 times the light of a candle.  At\r\nthe same distance, the portion of the radiation of the electric light\r\nwhich reaches the retina, but fails to excite vision, is about 1,500\r\ntimes the luminous radiation of the candle. [Footnote: It will be\r\nborne in mind that the heat which any ray, luminous or non-luminous,\r\nis competent to generate is the true measure of the energy of the\r\nray.]  But a candle on a clear night can readily be seen at a distance\r\nof a mile, its light at this distance being less than 1/20,000,000 of\r\nits light at the distance of a foot.\r\n\r\nHence, to make the candle-light a mile off equal in power to the\r\nnon-luminous radiation received from the electric light at a foot\r\ndistance, its intensity would have to be multiplied by 1,500 x\r\n20,000,000, or by thirty thousand millions.  Thus the thirty thousand\r\nmillionth part of the invisible radiation from the electric light,\r\nreceived by the retina at the distance of a foot, would, if slightly\r\nchanged in character, be amply sufficient to provoke vision.  Nothing\r\ncould more forcibly illustrate that special relationship supposed by\r\nMelloni and others to subsist between the optic nerve and the\r\noscillating periods of luminous bodies.  The optic nerve responds, as\r\nit were, to the waves with which it is in consonance, while it refuses\r\nto be excited by others of almost infinitely greater energy, whose\r\nperiods of recurrence are not in unison with its own.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n10.  Persistence of Rays.\r\n\r\nAt an early part of this lecture it was affirmed, that when a platinum\r\nwire was, gradually raised to a state of high incandescence, new rays\r\nwere constantly added, while the intensity of the old ones was\r\nincreased.  Thus, in Dr. Draper's experiments, the rise of temperature\r\nthat generated the orange, yellow, green, and blue augmented the\r\nintensity of the red.  What is true of the red is true of every other\r\nray of the spectrum, visible and invisible.  We cannot indeed see the\r\naugmentation of intensity in the region beyond the red, but we can\r\nmeasure it and express it numerically.  With this view the following\r\nexperiment was performed: A spiral of platinum wire was surrounded by\r\na small glass globe to protect it from currents of air; through an\r\norifice in the globe the rays could pass from the spiral and fall\r\nafterwards upon a thermo-electric pile.  Placing in front of the\r\norifice an opaque solution of iodine, the platinum was gradually\r\nraised from a low dark heat to the fullest incandescence, with the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\nAppearance of spiral    Energy of obscure radiation\r\n\r\nDark                                1\r\n\r\nDark, but hotter                    3\r\n\r\nDark, but still hotter              5\r\n\r\nDark, but still hotter             10\r\n\r\nFeeble red                         19\r\n\r\nDull red                           25\r\n\r\nRed                                37\r\n\r\nFull red.                          62\r\n\r\nOrange                             89\r\n\r\nBright orange                     144\r\n\r\nYellow                            202\r\n\r\nWhite                             276\r\n\r\nIntense white                     440\r\n\r\nThus the augmentation of the electric current, which raises the wire\r\nfrom its primitive dark condition to an intense white heat, exalts at\r\nthe same time the energy of the obscure radiation, until at the end it\r\nis fully 440 times what it was at the beginning.\r\n\r\nWhat has been here proved true of the totality of the ultra-red rays\r\nis true for each of them singly.  Placing our linear thermo-electric\r\npile in any part of the ultra-red spectrum, it may be proved that a\r\nray once emitted continues to be emitted with increased energy as the\r\ntemperature is augmented.  The platinum spiral, so often referred to,\r\nbeing raised to whiteness by an electric current, a brilliant spectrum\r\nwas formed from its light.  A linear thermo-electric pile was placed\r\nin the region of obscure rays beyond the red, and by diminishing the\r\ncurrent the spiral was reduced to a low temperature.  It was then\r\ncaused to pass through various degrees of darkness and incandescence,\r\nwith the following results:\r\n\r\nAppearance of spiral      Energy of obscure rays\r\n\r\nDark                                 1\r\n\r\nDark                                 6\r\n\r\nFaint red                           10\r\n\r\nDull red                            13\r\n\r\nRed                                 18\r\n\r\nFull red.                           27\r\n\r\nOrange                              60\r\n\r\nYellow                              93\r\n\r\nWhite                              122\r\n\r\nHere, as in the former case, the dark and bright radiations reached\r\ntheir maximum together; as the one augmented, the other augmented,\r\nuntil at last the energy of the obscure rays of the particular\r\nrefrangibility here chosen, became 122 times what it was at first. To\r\nreach a white heat the wire has to pass through all the stages of\r\ninvisible radiation, but in its most brilliant condition it embraces,\r\nin an intensified form, the rays of all those stages.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is with all other kinds of matter, as far as they have\r\nhitherto been examined.  Coke, whether brought to a white heat by the\r\nelectric current, or by the oxyhydrogen jet, pours out invisible rays\r\nwith augmented energy, as its light is increased.  The same is true of\r\nlime, bricks, and other substances.  It is true of all metals which\r\nare capable of being heated to incandescence.  It also holds good for\r\nphosphorus burning in oxygen.  Every gush of dazzling light has\r\nassociated with it a gush of invisible radiant heat, which far\r\ntranscends the light in energy.  This condition of things applies to\r\nall bodies capable of being raised to a white heat, either in the\r\nsolid or the molten condition.  It would doubtless also apply to the\r\nluminous fogs formed by the condensation of incandescent vapours.  In\r\nsuch cases when the curve representing the radiant energy of the body\r\nis constructed, the obscure radiation towers upwards like a mountain,\r\nthe luminous radiation resembling a mere 'spur' at its base.  From the\r\nvery brightness of the light of some of the fixed stars we may infer\r\nthe intensity of that dark radiation, which is the precursor and\r\ninseparable associate of their luminous rays.\r\n\r\nWe thus find the luminous radiation appearing when the radiant body\r\nhas attained a certain temperature; or, in other words, when the\r\nvibrating atoms of the body have attained a certain width of swing. In\r\nsolid and molten bodies a certain amplitude cannot be surpassed\r\nwithout the introduction of periods of vibration, which provoke the\r\nsense of vision.  How are we to figure this?  If permitted to\r\nspeculate, we might ask, are not these more rapid vibrations the\r\nprogeny of the slower?  Is it not really the mutual action of the\r\natoms, when they swing through very wide spaces, and thus encroach\r\nupon each other, that causes them to tremble in quicker periods?  If\r\nso, whatever be the agency by which the large swinging space is\r\nobtained, we shall have light-giving vibrations associated with it. It\r\nmatters not whether the large amplitudes be produced by the strokes of\r\na hammer, or by the blows of the molecules of a non-luminous gas, like\r\nair at some height above a gas-flame; or by the shock of the aether\r\nparticles when transmitting radiant heat.  The result in all cases\r\nwill be incandescence.  Thus, the invisible waves of our filtered\r\nelectric beam may be regarded as generating synchronous vibrations\r\namong the atoms of the platinum on which they impinge; but, once these\r\nvibrations have attained a certain amplitude, the mutual jostling of\r\nthe atoms produces quicker tremors, and the light-giving waves follow\r\nas the necessary product of the heat-giving ones.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n11. Absorption of Radiant Heat by Vapours and Odours.\r\n\r\nWe commenced the demonstrations brought forward in this lecture by\r\nexperiments on permanent gases, and we have now to turn our attention\r\nto the vapours of volatile liquids.  Here, as in the case of the\r\ngases, vast differences have been proved to exist between various\r\nkinds of molecules, as regards their power of intercepting the\r\ncalorific waves.  While some vapours allow the waves a comparatively\r\nfree passage, the faintest mixture of other vapours causes a\r\ndeflection of the magnetic needle.  Assuming the absorption effected\r\nby air, at a pressure of one atmosphere, to be unity, the following\r\nare the absorptions effected by a series of vapours at a pressure of\r\n1/60th of an atmosphere:\r\n\r\nName of vapour                        Absorption\r\n\r\nBisulphide of carbon                      47\r\n\r\nIodide of methyl                         115\r\n\r\nBenzol                                   136\r\n\r\nAmylene                                  321\r\n\r\nSulphuric ether                          440\r\n\r\nFormic ether                             548\r\n\r\nAcetic ether                             612\r\n\r\nBisulphide of carbon is the most transparent vapour in this list; and\r\nacetic ether the most opaque; 1/60th of an atmosphere of the former,\r\nhowever, produces 47 times the effect of a whole atmosphere of air,\r\nwhile 1/60th of an atmosphere of the latter produces 612 times the\r\neffect of a whole atmosphere of air.  Reducing dry air to the pressure\r\nof the acetic ether here employed, and comparing them then together,\r\nthe quantity of wave-motion intercepted by the ether would be many\r\nthousand times that intercepted by the air.\r\n\r\nAny one of these vapours discharged into the free atmosphere, in front\r\nof a body emitting obscure rays, intercepts more or less of the\r\nradiation.  A similar effect is produced by perfumes diffused in the\r\nair, though their attenuation is known to be almost infinite.\r\nCarrying, for example, a current of dry air over bibulous paper,\r\nmoistened by patchouli, the scent taken up by the current absorbs 30\r\ntimes the quantity of heat intercepted by the air which carries it;\r\nand yet patchouli acts more feebly on radiant heat than any other\r\nperfume yet examined.\r\n\r\nHere follow the results obtained with various essential oils, the\r\nodour, in each case, being carried by a current of dry air into the tube\r\nalready employed for gases and vapours:\r\n\r\nName of perfume                       Absorption\r\n\r\nPatchouli                                  30\r\n\r\nSandal wood                                32\r\n\r\nGeranium                                   33\r\n\r\nOil of cloves                              34\r\n\r\nOtto of roses                              37\r\n\r\nBergamot                                   44\r\n\r\nNeroli                                     47\r\n\r\nLavender                                   60\r\n\r\nLemon                                      65\r\n\r\nPortugal                                   67\r\n\r\nThyme                                      68\r\n\r\nRosemary                                   74\r\n\r\nOil of laurel                              80\r\n\r\nCamomile flowers                           87\r\n\r\nCassia                                    109\r\n\r\nSpikenard                                 355\r\n\r\nAniseed                                   372\r\n\r\nThus the absorption by a tube full of dry air being 1, that of the\r\nodour of patchouli diffused in it is 30, at of lavender 60, that of\r\nrosemary 74, whilst that of aniseed amounts to 372.  It would be idle\r\nto speculate the quantities of matter concerned in these actions.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n12.  Aqueous Vapour in relation to the Terrestrial Temperatures.\r\n\r\nWe are now fully prepared for a result which, without such\r\npreparation, might appear incredible.  Water is, to some extent, a\r\nvolatile body, and our atmosphere, resting as it does upon the surface\r\nof the ocean, receives from it a continual supply of aqueous vapour.\r\nIt would be an error to confound clouds or fog or any visible mist\r\nwith the vapour of water, which is a perfectly impalpable gas,\r\ndiffused, even on the clearest days, throughout the atmosphere.\r\nCompared with the great body of the air, the aqueous vapour it\r\ncontains is of almost infinitesimal amount, 99.5 out of every 100\r\nparts of the atmosphere being composed of oxygen and nitrogen.  In the\r\nabsence of experiment, we should never think of ascribing to this\r\nscant and varying constituent any important influence on terrestrial\r\nradiation; and yet its influence is far more potent than that of the\r\ngreat body of the air.  To say that on a day of average humidity in\r\nEngland, the atmospheric vapour exerts 100 times the action of the air\r\nitself, would certainly be an understatement of the fact.  Comparing a\r\nsingle molecule of aqueous vapour with an atom of either of the main\r\nconstituents of our atmosphere, I am not prepared to say how many\r\nthousand times the action of the former exceeds that of the latter.\r\n\r\nBut it must be borne in mind that these large numbers depend, in part,\r\non the extreme feebleness of the air; the power of aqueous vapour\r\nseems vast, because that of the air with which it is compared is\r\ninfinitesimal.  Absolutely considered, however, this substance,\r\nnotwithstanding its small specific gravity, exercises a very potent\r\naction.  Probably from 10 to 15 per cent.  of the heat radiated from\r\nthe earth is absorbed within 10 or 20 feet of the earth's surface.\r\nThis must evidently be of the utmost consequence to the life of the\r\nworld.  Imagine the superficial molecules of the earth agitated with\r\nthe motion of heat, and imparting it to the surrounding aether; this\r\nmotion would be carried rapidly away, and lost for ever to our planet,\r\nif the waves of aether had nothing but the air to contend with in\r\ntheir outward course.  But the aqueous vapour takes up the motion, and\r\nbecomes hereby heated, thus wrapping the earth like a warm garment,\r\nand protecting its surface from the deadly chill which it would\r\notherwise sustain.  Various philosophers have speculated on the\r\ninfluence of an atmospheric envelope.  De Saussure, Fourier,\r\nM. Pouillet, and Mr. Hopkins have, one and all, enriched scientific\r\nliterature with contributions on this subject, but the considerations\r\nwhich these eminent men have applied to atmospheric air, have, if my\r\nexperiments be correct, to be transferred to the aqueous vapour.\r\n\r\nThe observations of meteorologists furnish important, though hitherto\r\nunconscious evidence of the influence of this agent.  Wherever the air\r\nis dry we are liable to daily extremes of temperature.  By day, such\r\nplaces, the sun's heat reaches the earth unimpeded, and renders the\r\nmaximum high; by night, on the other hand, the earth's heat escapes\r\nunhindered to space, and renders the minimum low.  Hence the\r\ndifference between the maximum and minimum is greatest where the air\r\nis driest. In the plains of India, the heights of the Himalaya, in\r\ncentral Asia, in Australia--wherever drought reigns, we have the heat\r\nof day forcibly contrasted with the chill of night.  In the Sahara\r\nitself, when the sun's rays cease to impinge on the burning soil, the\r\ntemperature runs rapidly down to freezing, because there is no vapour\r\noverhead to check the calorific drain.  And here another instance\r\nmight be added to the numbers already known, in which nature tends as\r\nit were to check her own excess.  By nocturnal refrigeration, the\r\naqueous vapour of the air is condensed to water on the surface of the\r\nearth; and, as only the superficial portions radiate, the act of\r\ncondensation makes water the radiating body.  Now experiment proves\r\nthat to the rays emitted by water, aqueous vapour is especially\r\nopaque.  Hence the very act of condensation, consequent on terrestrial\r\ncooling, becomes a safeguard to the earth, imparting to its radiation\r\nthat particular character which renders it most liable to be prevented\r\nfrom escaping into space.\r\n\r\nIt might however be urged that, inasmuch as we derive all our heat\r\nfrom the sun, the selfsame covering which protects the earth from\r\nchill must also shut out the solar radiation.  This is partially true,\r\nbut only partially; the sun's rays are different in quality from the\r\nearth's rays, and it does not at all follow that the substance which\r\nabsorbs the one must necessarily absorb the other.  Through a layer of\r\nwater, for example, one tenth of an inch in thickness, the sun's rays\r\nare transmitted with comparative freedom; but through a layer half\r\nthis thickness, as Melloni has proved, no single ray from the warmed\r\nearth could pass.  In like manner, the sun's rays pass with\r\ncomparative freedom through the aqueous vapour of the air: the\r\nabsorbing power of this substance being mainly exerted upon the\r\ninvisible heat that endeavours to escape from the earth.  In\r\nconsequence of this differential action upon solar and terrestrial\r\nheat, the mean temperature of our planet is higher than is due to its\r\ndistance from the sun.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n13.  Liquids and their Vapours in relation to Radiant Heat.\r\n\r\nThe deportment here assigned to atmospheric vapour has been\r\nestablished by direct experiments on it taken from the streets and\r\nparks of London, from the downs of Epsom, from the hills and sea-beach\r\nof the Isle of Wight, and also by experiments on air in the first\r\ninstance dried, and afterwards rendered artificially humid by pure\r\ndistilled water.  It has also been established in the following way: Ten\r\nvolatile liquids were taken at random and the power of these liquids, at a\r\ncommon thickness, to intercept the waves of heat, was carefully\r\ndetermined.  The vapours of the liquids were next taken, in quantities\r\nproportional to the quantities of liquid, and the power of the vapours\r\nintercept the waves of heat was also determined.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the substance which exerted the least absorptive\r\npower, and proceeding onwards to the most energetic, the following\r\norder of absorption was observed:\r\n\r\nLiquids                             Vapours\r\n\r\nBisulphide of carbon.               Bisulphide of carbon.\r\n\r\nChloroform.                         Chloroform.\r\n\r\nIodide of methyl.                   Iodide of methyl.\r\n\r\nIodide of ethyl.                    Iodide of ethyl.\r\n\r\nBenzol.                             Benzol.\r\n\r\nAmylene.                            Amylene.\r\n\r\nSulphuric aether.                   Sulphuric aether.\r\n\r\nAcetic aether.                      Acetic aether.\r\n\r\nFormic aether.                      Formic aether.\r\n\r\nAlcohol.                            Alcohol.\r\n\r\nWater.\r\n\r\nWe here find the order of absorption in both cases be the same.  We\r\nhave liberated the molecules from the bonds which trammel them more or\r\nless in a liquid condition; but this change in their state of\r\naggregation does not change their relative powers of absorption.\r\nNothing could more clearly prove that the act of absorption depends\r\nupon the individual molecule, which equally asserts its power in the\r\nliquid and the gaseous state.  We may safely conclude from the above\r\ntable that the position of a vapour is determined by that of its\r\nliquid.  Now at the very foot of the list of liquids stands _water_,\r\nsignalising itself above all others by its enormous power of\r\nabsorption.  And from this fact, even if no direct experiment on the\r\nvapour of water had ever been made, we should be entitled to rank that\r\nvapour as our most powerful absorber of radiant heat.  Its\r\nattenuation, however, diminishes its action.  I have proved that a\r\nshell of air two inches in thickness surrounding our planet, and\r\nsaturated with the vapour of sulphuric aether, would intercept 35 per\r\ncent.  of the earth's radiation.  And though the quantity of aqueous\r\nvapour necessary to saturate air is much less than the amount of\r\nsulphuric aether vapour which it can sustain, it is still extremely\r\nprobable that the estimate already made of the action of atmospheric\r\nvapour within 10 feet of the earth's surface, is under the mark; and\r\nthat we are indebted to this wonderful substance, to an extent not\r\naccurately determined, but certainly far beyond what has hitherto been\r\nimagined, for the temperature now existing at the surface of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n14.  Reciprocity of Radiation and Absorption.\r\n\r\nThroughout the reflections which have hitherto occupied us, the image\r\nbefore the mind has been that of a radiant source sending forth\r\ncalorific waves, which on passing among the molecules of a gas or\r\nvapour were intercepted by those molecules in various degrees.  In all\r\ncases it was the transference of motion from the aether to the\r\ncomparatively quiescent molecules of the gas or vapour that occupied\r\nour thoughts.  We have now to change the form of our conception, and\r\nto figure these molecules not as absorbers but as radiators, not as\r\nthe recipients but as the originators of wave-motion.  That is to say,\r\nwe must figure them vibrating, and generating in the surrounding\r\naether undulations which speed through it with the velocity of light.\r\nOur object now is to enquire whether the act of chemical combination,\r\nwhich proves so potent as regards the phenomena of absorption, does\r\nnot also manifest its power in the phenomena of radiation.  For the\r\nexamination of this question it is necessary, in the first place, to\r\nheat our gases and vapours to the same temperature, and then examine\r\ntheir power of discharging the motion thus imparted to them upon the\r\naether in which they swing.\r\n\r\nA heated copper ball was placed above a ring gas-burner possessing a\r\ngreat number of small apertures, the burner being connected by a tube\r\nwith vessels containing the various gases to be examined.  By gentle\r\npressure the gases were forced through the orifices of the burner\r\nagainst the copper ball, where each of them, being heated, rose in an\r\nascending column.  A thermoelectric pile, entirely screened from the\r\nhot ball, was exposed to the radiation of the warm gas, while the\r\ndeflection of a magnetic needle connected with the pile declared the\r\nenergy of the radiation.\r\n\r\nBy this mode of experiment it was proved that the selfsame molecular\r\narrangement which renders a gas a powerful absorber, renders it a\r\npowerful radiator--that the atom or molecule which is competent to\r\nintercept the calorific waves is, in the same degree, competent to\r\nsend them forth.  Thus, while the atoms of elementary gases proved\r\nthemselves unable to emit any sensible amount of radiant heat, the\r\nmolecules of compound gases were shown to be capable of powerfully\r\ndisturbing the surrounding aether.  By special modes of experiment the\r\nsame was proved to hold good for the vapours of volatile liquids, the\r\nradiative power of every vapour being found proportional to its\r\nabsorptive power.\r\n\r\nThe method of experiment here pursued, though not of the simplest\r\ncharacter, is still easy to grasp.  When air is permitted to rush into\r\nan exhausted tube, the temperature of the air is raised to a degree\r\nequivalent to the _vis viva_ extinguished. [Footnote: See above for a\r\ndefinition of _vis viva_.] Such air is said to be dynamically heated,\r\nand, if pure, it shows itself incompetent to radiate, even when a\r\nrock-salt window is provided for the passage of its rays.  But if\r\ninstead of being empty the tube contain a small quantity of vapour,\r\nthe warmed air communicates its heat by contact to the vapour, the\r\nmolecules of which convert into the radiant form the heat imparted to\r\nthem by the atoms of the air.  By this process also, which I have\r\ncalled Dynamic Radiation, the reciprocity of radiation and absorption\r\nhas been conclusively proved. [Footnote: When heated air imparts its\r\nmotion to another gas or vapour, the transference of heat is\r\naccompanied by a change of vibrating period.  The Dynamic Radiation of\r\nvapours is rendered possible by this transmutation of vibrations.]\r\n\r\nIn the excellent researches of Leslie, De la Provostaye and Detains,\r\nand Balfour Stewart, the same reciprocity, as regards solid bodies,\r\nhas been variously illustrated; while the labours, theoretical and\r\nexperimental, of Kirchhoff have given this subject a wonderful\r\nexpansion, and enriched it by applications of the highest kind.  To\r\ntheir results are now to be added the foregoing, whereby gases and\r\nvapours, which have been hitherto thought inaccessible to experiments\r\nwith the thermo-electric pile, are proved by it to exhibit the\r\nindissoluble duality of radiation and absorption, the influence of\r\nchemical combination on both being exhibited in the most decisive and\r\nextraordinary way.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n15.  Influence of Vibrating Period and Molecular Form.  Physical\r\nAnalysis of the Human Breath.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing experiments with gases and vapours have employed\r\nthroughout invisible rays, and found some of these bodies so impervious\r\nto radiant heat, that lengths of a few feet they intercept every ray\r\nas actually as a layer of pitch.  The substances, however, which show\r\nthemselves thus opaque to radiant heat perfectly transparent to light.\r\nNow the rays of light differ from those of invisible heat merely in\r\npoint of period, the former failing to affect the retina because their\r\nperiods of recurrence are too slow.  Hence, in one way or other, the\r\ntransparency of our gases and vapours depends upon the periods of the\r\nwaves which impinge upon them.  What is the nature of this dependence?\r\nThe admirable researches of Kirchhoff help us an answer.  The atoms\r\nand molecules of every gas have certain definite rates of oscillation,\r\nand those waves aether are most copiously absorbed whose periods\r\nrecurrence synchronise with those of the atomic groups amongst which they\r\npass.  Thus, when we find invisible rays absorbed and the visible ones\r\ntransmitted by a layer of gas, we conclude that the oscillating\r\nperiods of the atoms constituting the gaseous molecules coincide with\r\nthose of the invisible, and not with those of the visible spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt requires some discipline of the imagination to form a clear picture\r\nof this process.  Such a picture is, however, possible, and ought to\r\nbe obtained.  When the waves of aether impinge upon molecules whose\r\nperiods of vibration coincide with the recurrence of the undulations,\r\nthe timed strokes of the waves augment the vibration of the molecules,\r\nas a heavy pendulum is set in motion by well-timed puffs of breath.\r\nMillions of millions of shocks are received every second from the\r\ncalorific waves; and it is not difficult to see that as every wave\r\narrives just in time to repeat the action of its predecessor, the\r\nmolecules must finally be caused to swing through wider spaces than if\r\nthe arrivals were not so timed.  In fact, it is not difficult to see\r\nthat an assemblage of molecules, operated upon by contending waves,\r\nmight remain practically quiescent.  This is actually the case when\r\nthe waves of the visible spectrum pass through a transparent gas or\r\nvapour.  There is here no sensible transference of motion from the\r\naether to the molecules; in other words, there is no sensible\r\nabsorption of heat.\r\n\r\nOne striking example of the influence of period may be here recorded.\r\nCarbonic acid gas is one of the feeblest absorbers of the radiant heat\r\nemitted by solid bodies.  It is, for example, to a great extent\r\ntransparent to the rays emitted by the heated copper plate already\r\nreferred to.  There are, however, certain rays, comparatively few in\r\nnumber, emitted by the copper, to which the carbonic acid is\r\nimpervious; and could we obtain a source of heat emitting such rays\r\nonly, we should find carbonic acid more opaque to the radiation from\r\nthat source, than any other gas.  Such a source is actually found in\r\nthe flame of carbonic oxide, where hot carbonic acid constitutes the\r\nmain radiating body.  Of the rays emitted by our heated plate of\r\ncopper, olefiant gas absorbs ten times the quantity absorbed by\r\ncarbonic acid.  Of the rays emitted by a carbonic oxide flame,\r\ncarbonic acid absorbs twice as much as olefiant gas.  This wonderful\r\nchange in the power of the former, as an absorber, is simply due to\r\nthe fact, that the periods of the hot and cold carbonic acid are\r\nidentical, and that the waves from the flame freely transfer their\r\nmotion to the molecules which synchronise with them.  Thus it is that\r\nthe tenth an atmosphere of carbonic acid, enclosed in a tube four feet\r\nlong, absorbs 60 per cent.  of the radiation from carbonic oxide\r\nflame, while one-thirtieth of an atmosphere absorbs 48 per cent.  of\r\nthe heat from the same source.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the presence of the minutest quantity of carbonic acid may be\r\ndetected by its action on the rays from the carbonic oxide flame.\r\nCarrying, for example, the dried human breath into a tube four feet\r\nlong, the absorption there effected by the carbonic acid of the breath\r\namounts to 50 per cent.  of the entire radiation.  Radiant heat may\r\nindeed be employed as a means of determining practically the amount of\r\ncarbonic acid expired from the lungs.  My late assistant, Mr. Barrett,\r\nwhile under my direction, made this determination.  The absorption\r\nproduced by the breath freed from its moisture, but retaining its\r\ncarbonic acid, was first determined.  Carbonic acid, artificially\r\nprepared, was then mixed with dry air in such proportions that the\r\naction of the mixture upon the rays of heat was the same as that of\r\nthe dried breath.  The percentage of the former being known,\r\nimmediately gave that of the latter.  The same breath, analysed\r\nchemically by Dr. Frankland, and physically by Mr. Barrett, gave the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\nPercentage of Carbonic Acid in the Human Breath.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis              Physical analysis\r\n\r\n4.66                                4.56\r\n\r\n5.33                                5.22\r\n\r\nIt is thus proved that in the quantity of aethereal motion which it is\r\ncompetent to take up, we have a practical measure of the carbonic acid\r\nof the breath, and hence of the combustion going on in the human\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nStill this question of period, though of the utmost importance, is not\r\ncompetent to account for the whole of the observed facts.  The aether,\r\nas far as we know, accepts vibrations of all periods with the same\r\nreadiness.  To it the oscillations of an atom of free oxygen are just\r\nas acceptable as those of the atoms in a molecule of olefiant gas;\r\nthat the vibrating oxygen then stands so far below the olefiant gas in\r\nradiant power must be referred not to period, but to some other\r\npeculiarity.  The atomic group which constitutes the molecule of\r\nolefiant gas, produces many thousand times the disturbance caused by\r\nthe oxygen, it may be because the group is able to lay a vastly more\r\npowerful hold upon the aether than single atoms can.  Another, and\r\nprobably very potent cause of the difference may be, that the\r\nvibrations, being those of the constituent atoms of the molecule,\r\n[Footnote: See 'Physical Considerations,' Art. iv.] are generated\r\nin highly condensed aether, which acts like condensed air upon sound.\r\nBut whatever may be the fate of these attempts to visualise the physics\r\nof the process, it will still remain true, that to account for the\r\nphenomena of radiation and absorption we must take into consideration\r\nthe shape, size, and condition of the aether within the molecules, by\r\nwhich the external aether is disturbed.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n16.  Summary and Conclusion.\r\n\r\nLet us now cast a momentary glance over the ground that we have left\r\nbehind.  The general nature of light and heat was first briefly\r\ndescribed: the compounding of matter from elementary atoms, and the\r\ninfluence of the act of combination on radiation and absorption, were\r\nconsidered and experimentally illustrated.  Through the transparent\r\nelementary gases radiant heat was found to pass as through a vacuum,\r\nwhile many of the compound gases presented almost impassable obstacles\r\nto the calorific-waves.  This deportment of the simple gases directed\r\nour attention to other elementary bodies, the examination of which led\r\nto the discovery that the element iodine, dissolved in bisulphide of\r\ncarbon, possesses the power of detaching, with extraordinary sharpness,\r\nthe light of the spectrum from its heat, intercepting all luminous\r\nrays up to the extreme red, and permitting the calorific rays beyond\r\nthe red to pass freely through it.  This substance was then employed\r\nto filter the beams of the electric light, and to form foci of\r\ninvisible rays so intense as to produce almost all the effects\r\nobtainable in ordinary fire.  Combustible bodies were burnt, and\r\nrefractory ones were raised to a white heat, by the concentrated\r\ninvisible rays.  Thus, by exalting their refrangibility, the invisible\r\nrays of the electric light were rendered visible, and all the colours\r\nof the solar spectrum were extracted from utter darkness.  The extreme\r\nrichness of the electric light in invisible rays of low refrangibility\r\nwas demonstrated, one-eighth only of its radiation consisting of\r\nluminous rays.  The deadness of the optic nerve to those invisible\r\nrays was proved, and experiments were then added to show that the\r\nbright and the dark rays of a solid body, raised gradually to\r\nincandescence, are strengthened together; intense dark heat being an\r\ninvariable accompaniment of intense white heat.  A sun could not be\r\nformed, or a meteorite rendered luminous, on any other condition.  The\r\nlight-giving rays constituting only a small fraction of the total\r\nradiation, their unspeakable importance to us is due to the fact, that\r\ntheir periods are attuned to the special requirements of the eye.\r\n\r\nAmong the vapours of volatile liquids vast differences were also found\r\nto exist, as regards their powers of absorption.  We followed various\r\nmolecules from a state of liquid to a state of gas, and found, in both\r\nstates of aggregation, the power of the individual molecules equally\r\nasserted.  The position of a vapour as an absorber of radiant heat was\r\nshown to be determined by that of the liquid from which it is derived.\r\nReversing our conceptions, and regarding the molecules of gases and\r\nvapours not as the recipients but as the originators of wave-motion;\r\nnot as absorbers but as radiators; it was proved that the powers of\r\nabsorption and radiation went hand in hand, the self-same chemical act\r\nwhich rendered a body competent to intercept the waves of aether,\r\nrendering it competent, in the same degree, to generate them. Perfumes\r\nwere next subjected to examination, and, notwithstanding their\r\nextraordinary tenuity, they were found vastly superior, in point of\r\nabsorptive power, to the body of the air in which they were diffused.\r\nWe were led thus slowly up to the examination of the most widely\r\ndiffused and most important of all vapours--the aqueous vapour of our\r\natmosphere, and we found in it a potent absorber of the purely\r\ncalorific rays.  The power of this substance to influence climate, and\r\nits general influence on the temperature of the earth, were then\r\nbriefly dwelt upon.  A cobweb spread above a blossom is sufficient to\r\nprotect it from nightly chill; and thus the aqueous vapour of our\r\nair, attenuated as it is, checks the drain of terrestrial heat, and\r\nsaves the surface of our planet from the refrigeration which would\r\nassuredly accrue, were no such substance interposed between it and the\r\nvoids of space.  We considered the influence of vibrating period, and\r\nmolecular form, on absorption and radiation, and finally deduced, from\r\nits action upon radiant heat, the exact amount of carbonic acid\r\nexpired by the human lungs.\r\n\r\nThus, in brief outline, were placed before you some of the results of\r\nrecent enquiries in the domain of Radiation, and my aim throughout has\r\nbeen to raise in your minds distinct physical images of the various\r\nprocesses involved in our researches.  It is thought by some that\r\nnatural science has a deadening influence on the imagination, and a\r\ndoubt might fairly be raised as to the value of any study which would\r\nnecessarily have this effect.  But the experience of the last hour\r\nmust, I think, have convinced you, that the study of natural science\r\ngoes hand in hand with the culture of the imagination.  Throughout the\r\ngreater part of this discourse we have been sustained by this faculty.\r\nWe have been picturing atoms, and molecules, and vibrations, and\r\nwaves, which eye has never seen nor ear heard, and which can only be\r\ndiscerned by the exercise of imagination.  This, in fact, is the\r\nfaculty which enables us transcend the boundaries of sense, and\r\nconnect the phenomena of our visible world with those of an invisible\r\none.  Without imagination we never could have risen to the conceptions\r\nwhich have occupied us here today; and in proportion to your power of\r\nexercising this faculty aright, and of associating definite mental\r\nimages with the terms employed, will be the pleasure and the profit\r\nwhich you will derive from this lecture.\r\n\r\nThe outward facts of nature are insufficient to satisfy the mind.  We\r\ncannot be content with knowing that the light and heat of the sun\r\nilluminate and warm the world.  We are led irresistibly to enquire,\r\n'What is light, and what is heat?' and this question leads us at once\r\nout of the region of sense into that of imagination. [Footnote: This\r\nline of thought was pursued further five years subsequently.  See\r\n'Scientific Use of the Imagination' in Vol. II.]\r\n\r\nThus pondering, and questioning, and striving to supplement that which\r\nis felt and seen, but which is incomplete, by something unfelt and\r\nunseen which is necessary to its completeness, men of genius have in\r\npart discerned, not only the nature of light and heat, but also,\r\nthrough them, the general relationship of natural phenomena.  The\r\nworking power of Nature consists of actual or potential motion, of\r\nwhich all its phenomena are but special forms.  This motion manifests\r\nitself in tangible and in intangible matter, being incessantly\r\ntransferred from the one to the other, and incessantly transformed by\r\nthe change.  It is as real in the waves of the aether as in the waves\r\nof the sea; the latter--derived as they are from winds, which in their\r\nturn are derived from the sun--are, indeed, nothing more than the\r\nheaped-up motion of the aether waves.  It is the calorific waves\r\nemitted by the sun which heat our air, produce our winds, and hence\r\nagitate our ocean.  And whether they break in foam upon the shore, or\r\nrub silently against the ocean's bed, or subside by the mutual\r\nfriction of their own parts, the sea waves, which cannot subside\r\nwithout producing heat, finally resolve themselves into waves of\r\naether, thus regenerating the motion from which their temporary\r\nexistence was derived.  This connection is typical.  Nature is not an\r\naggregate of independent parts, but an organic whole.  If you open a\r\npiano and sing into it, a certain string will respond.  Change the\r\npitch of our voice; the first string ceases to vibrate, but another\r\nreplies.  Change again the pitch; the first two strings are silent,\r\nwhile another resounds.  Thus is sentient man acted on by Nature, the\r\noptic, the auditory, and other nerves of the human body being so many\r\nstrings differently tuned, and responsive to different forms of the\r\nuniversal power.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nIII ON RADIANT HEAT IN RELATION TO THE COLOUR AND CHEMICAL\r\nCONSTITUTION OF BODIES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A discourse delivered in the Royal Institution of Great\r\nBritain, Jan. 19, 1866.]\r\n\r\nONE of the most important functions of physical science, considered as\r\na discipline of the mind, is to enable us by means of the sensible\r\nprocesses of Nature to apprehend the insensible.  The sensible\r\nprocesses give direction to the line of thought; but this once given,\r\nthe length of the line is not limited by the boundaries of the senses.\r\nIndeed, the domain of the senses, in Nature, is almost infinitely\r\nsmall in comparison with the vast region accessible to thought which\r\nlies beyond them.  From a few observations of a comet, when it comes\r\nwithin the range of his telescope, an astronomer can calculate its\r\npath in regions which no telescope can reach: and in like manner, by\r\nmeans of data furnished in the narrow world of the senses, we make\r\nourselves at home in other and wider worlds, which are traversed by\r\nthe intellect alone.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest ages the questions, 'What is light?' and 'What is\r\nheat?' have occurred to the minds of men; but these questions never\r\nwould have been answered had they not been preceded by the question,\r\n'What is sound?' Amid the grosser phenomena of acoustics the mind was\r\nfirst disciplined, conceptions being thus obtained from direct\r\nobservation, which were afterwards applied to phenomena of a character\r\nfar too subtle to be observed directly.  Sound we know to be due to\r\nvibratory motion.  A vibrating tuning-fork, for example, moulds the\r\nair around it into undulations or waves, which speed away on all sides\r\nwith a certain measured velocity, impinge upon the drum of the ear,\r\nshake the auditory nerve, and awake in the brain the sensation of\r\nsound.  When sufficiently near a sounding body we can feel the\r\nvibrations of the air.  A deaf man, for example, plunging his hand\r\ninto a bell when it is sounded, feels through the common nerves of his\r\nbody those tremors which, when imparted to the nerves of healthy ears,\r\nare translated into sound.  There are various ways of rendering those\r\nsonorous vibrations not only tangible but visible; and it was not\r\nuntil numberless experiments of this kind had been executed, that the\r\nscientific investigator abandoned himself wholly, and without a shadow\r\nof misgiving, to the conviction that what is sound within us is,\r\noutside of us, a motion of the air.\r\n\r\nBut once having established this fact--once having proved beyond all\r\ndoubt that the sensation of sound is produced by an agitation of the\r\nauditory nerve--the thought soon suggested itself that light might be\r\ndue to an agitation of the optic nerve.  This was a great step in\r\nadvance of that ancient notion which regarded light as something\r\nemitted by the eye, and not as anything imparted to it.  But if light\r\nbe produced by an agitation of the retina, what is it that produces\r\nthe agitation?  Newton, you know, supposed minute particles to be shot\r\nthrough the humours of the eye against the retina, which he supposed\r\nto hang like a target at the back of the eye.  The impact of these\r\nparticles against the target, Newton believed to be the cause of\r\nlight. But Newton's notion has not held its ground, being entirely\r\ndriven from the field by the more wonderful and far more philosophical\r\nnotion that light, like sound, is a product of wave-motion.\r\n\r\nThe domain in which this motion of light is carried on lies entirely\r\nbeyond the reach of our senses.  The waves of light require a medium\r\nfor their formation and propagation; but we cannot see, or feel, or\r\ntaste, or smell this medium.  How, then, has its existence been\r\nestablished?  By showing, that by the assumption of this wonderful\r\nintangible aether, all the phenomena of optics are accounted for, with\r\na fulness, and clearness, and conclusiveness, which leave no desire of\r\nthe intellect unsatisfied.  When the law of gravitation first\r\nsuggested itself to the mind of Newton, what did he do?  He set\r\nhimself to examine whether it accounted for all the facts.  He\r\ndetermined the courses of the planets; he calculated the rapidity of\r\nthe moon's fall towards the earth; he considered the precession of the\r\nequinoxes, the ebb and flow of the tides, and found all explained by\r\nthe law of gravitation.  He therefore regarded this law as\r\nestablished, and the verdict of science subsequently confirmed his\r\nconclusion.  On similar, and, if possible, on stronger grounds, we\r\nfound our belief in the existence of the universal aether.  It\r\nexplains facts far more various and complicated than those on which\r\nNewton based his law.  If a single phenomenon could be pointed out\r\nwhich the aether is proved incompetent to explain, we should have to\r\ngive it up; but no such phenomenon has ever been pointed out.  It is,\r\ntherefore, at least as certain that space is filled with a medium, by\r\nmeans of which suns and stars diffuse their radiant power, as that it\r\nis traversed by that force which holds in its grasp, not only our\r\nplanetary system, but the immeasurable heavens themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is no more wonderful instance than this of the production of a\r\nline of thought, from the world of the senses into the region of pure\r\nimagination.  I mean by imagination here, not that play of fancy which\r\ncan give to airy nothings a local habitation and a name, but that\r\npower which enables the mind to conceive realities which lie beyond\r\nthe range of the senses--to present to itself distinct images of\r\nprocesses which, though mighty in the aggregate beyond all conception,\r\nare so minute individually as to elude all observation.  It is the\r\nwaves of air excited by a tuning-fork which render its vibrations\r\naudible.  It is the waves of aether sent forth from those lamps\r\noverhead which render them luminous to us; but so minute are these\r\nwaves, that it would take from 30,000 to 60,000 of them placed end to\r\nend to cover a single inch.  Their number, however, compensates for\r\ntheir minuteness.  Trillions of them have entered your eyes, and hit\r\nthe retina at the backs of your eyes, in the time consumed in the\r\nutterance of the shortest sentence of this discourse.  This is the\r\nsteadfast result of modern research; but we never could have reached\r\nit without previous discipline.  We never could have measured the\r\nwaves of light, nor even imagined them to exist, had we not previously\r\nexercised ourselves among the waves of sound.  Sound and light are now\r\nmutually helpful, the conceptions of each being expanded,\r\nstrengthened, and defined by the conceptions of the other.\r\n\r\nThe aether which conveys the pulses of light and heat not only fills\r\ncelestial space, swathing suns, and planets, and moons, but it also\r\nencircles the atoms of which these bodies are composed.  It is the\r\nmotion of these atoms, and not that of any sensible parts of bodies,\r\nthat the aether conveys.  This motion is the objective cause of what,\r\nin our sensations, are light and heat.  An atom, then, sending its\r\npulses through the aether, resembles a tuning-fork sending its pulses\r\nthrough the air.  Let us look for a moment at this thrilling medium,\r\nand briefly consider its relation to the bodies whose vibrations it\r\nconveys.  Different bodies, when heated to the same temperature,\r\npossess very different powers of agitating the aether: some are good\r\nradiators, others are bad radiators; which means that some are so\r\nconstituted as to communicate their atomic motion freely to the\r\naether, producing therein powerful undulations; while the atoms of\r\nothers are unable thus to communicate their motions, but glide through\r\nthe medium without materially disturbing its repose.  Recent\r\nexperiments have proved that elementary bodies, except under certain\r\nanomalous conditions, belong to the class of bad radiators.  An atom,\r\nvibrating in the aether, resembles a naked tuning-fork vibrating in\r\nthe air.  The amount of motion communicated to the air by the thin\r\nprongs is too small to evoke at any distance the sensation of sound.\r\nBut if we permit the atoms to combine chemically and form molecules,\r\nthe result, in many cases, is an enormous change in the power of\r\nradiation.  The amount of aethereal disturbance, produced by the\r\ncombined atoms of a body, may be many thousand times that produced by\r\nthe same atoms when uncombined.\r\n\r\nThe pitch of a musical note depends upon the rapidity of its\r\nvibrations, or, in other words, on the length of its waves.  Now, the\r\npitch of a note answers to the colour of light.  Taking a slice of\r\nwhite light from the sun, or from an electric lamp, and causing the\r\nlight to pass through an arrangement of prisms, it is decomposed.  We\r\nhave the effect obtained by Newton, who first unrolled the solar beam\r\ninto the splendours of the solar spectrum.  At one end of this\r\nspectrum we have red light, at the other, violet; and between those\r\nextremes lie the other prismatic colours.  As we advance along the\r\nspectrum from the red to the violet, the pitch of the light--if I may\r\nuse the expression--heightens, the sensation of violet being produced\r\nby a more rapid succession of impulses than that which produces the\r\nimpression of red.  The vibrations of the violet are about twice as\r\nrapid as those of the red; in other words, the range of the visible\r\nspectrum is about an octave.\r\n\r\nThere is no solution of continuity in this spectrum one colour changes\r\ninto another by insensible gradations.  It is as if an infinite number\r\nof tuning-forks, of gradually augmenting pitch, were vibrating at the\r\nsame time.  But turning to another spectrum--that, namely, obtained\r\nfrom the incandescent vapour of silver--you observe that it consists\r\nof two narrow and intensely luminous green bands.  Here it is as if\r\ntwo forks only, of slightly different pitch, were vibrating.  The\r\nlength of the waves which produce this first band is such that 47,460\r\nof them, placed end to end, would fill an inch.  The waves which\r\nproduce the second band are a little shorter; it would take of these\r\n47,920 to fill an inch.  In the case of the first band, the number of\r\nimpulses imparted, in one second, to every eye which sees it, is 677\r\nmillions of millions; while the number of impulses imparted, in the\r\nsame time, by the second band is 600 millions of millions.  We may\r\nproject upon a white screen the beautiful stream of green light from\r\nwhich these bands were derived.  This luminous stream is the\r\nincandescent vapour of silver.  The rates of vibration of the atoms of\r\nthat vapour are as rigidly fixed as those of two tuning-forks; and to\r\nwhatever height the temperature of the vapour may be raised, the\r\nrapidity of its vibrations, and consequently its colour, which wholly\r\ndepends upon that rapidity, remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe vapour of water, as well as the vapour of silver, has its definite\r\nperiods of vibration, and these are such as to disqualify the vapour,\r\nwhen acting freely as such, from being raised to a white heat.  The\r\noxyhydrogen flame, for example, consists of hot aqueous vapour.  It is\r\nscarcely visible in the air of this room, and it would be still less\r\nvisible if we could burn the gas in a clean atmosphere.  But the\r\natmosphere, even at the summit of Mont Blanc, is dirty; in London it\r\nis more than dirty; and the burning dirt gives to this flame the\r\ngreater portion of its present light.  But the heat of the flame is\r\nenormous.  Cast iron fuses at a temperature of 2,000° Fahr; while the\r\ntemperature of the oxyhydrogen flame is 6,000° Fahr.  A piece of\r\nplatinum is heated to vivid redness, at a distance of two inches\r\nbeyond the visible termination of the flame.  The vapour which\r\nproduces incandescence is here absolutely dark.  In the flame itself\r\nthe platinum is raised to dazzling whiteness, and is even pierced by\r\nthe flame.  When this flame impinges on a piece of lime, we have the\r\ndazzling Drummond light.  But the light is here due to the fact that\r\nwhen it impinges upon the solid body, the vibrations excited in that\r\nbody by the flame are of periods different from its own.\r\n\r\nThus far we have fixed our attention on atoms and molecules in a state\r\nof vibration, and surrounded by a medium which accepts their\r\nvibrations, and transmits them through space.  But suppose the waves\r\ngenerated by one system of molecules to impinge upon another system,\r\nhow will the waves be affected?  Will they be stopped, or will they be\r\npermitted to pass?  Will they transfer their motion to the molecules\r\non which they impinge, or will they glide round the molecules, through\r\nthe intermolecular spaces, and thus escape?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question depends upon a condition which may be\r\nbeautifully exemplified by an experiment on sound.  These two\r\ntuning-forks are tuned absolutely alike.  They vibrate with the same\r\nrapidity, and, mounted thus upon their resonant cases, you hear them\r\nloudly sounding the same musical note.  Stopping one of the forks, I\r\nthrow the other into strong vibration, and bring that other near the\r\nsilent fork, but not into contact with it.  Allowing them to continue\r\nin this position for four or five seconds, and then stopping the\r\nvibrating fork, the sound does not cease.  The second fork has taken\r\nup the vibrations of its neighbour, and is now sounding in its turn.\r\nDismounting one of the forks, and permitting the other to remain upon\r\nits stand, I throw the dismounted fork into strong vibration.  You\r\ncannot hear it sound.  Detached from its case, the amount of motion\r\nwhich it can communicate to the air is too small to be sensible at any\r\ndistance.  When the dismounted fork is brought close to the mounted\r\none, but not into actual contact with it, out of the silence rises a\r\nmellow sound.  Whence comes it?  From the vibrations which have been\r\ntransferred from the dismounted fork to the mounted one.\r\n\r\nThat the motion should thus transfer itself through the air it is\r\nnecessary that the two forks should be in perfect unison.  If a morsel\r\nof wax not larger than a pea be placed on one of the forks, it is\r\nrendered thereby powerless to affect, or to be affected by, the other.\r\nIt is easy to understand this experiment.  The pulses of the one fork\r\ncan affect the other, because they are _perfectly timed_.  A single\r\npulse causes the prong of the silent fork to vibrate through an\r\ninfinitesimal space.  But just as it has completed this small\r\nvibration another pulse is ready to strike it.  Thus, the impulses add\r\nthemselves together.  In the five seconds during which the forks were\r\nheld near each other, the vibrating fork sent 1,280 waves against its\r\nneighbour and those 1,280 shocks, all delivered at the proper moment,\r\nall, as I have said, perfectly timed, have given such strength to the\r\nvibrations of the mounted fork as to render them audible to all.\r\n\r\nAnother curious illustration of the influence of synchronism on\r\nmusical vibrations, is this: Three small gas-flames are inserted into\r\nthree glass tubes of different lengths.  Each of these flames can be\r\ncaused to emit a musical note, the pitch of which is determined by the\r\nlength of the tube surrounding the flame.  The shorter the tube the\r\nhigher is the pitch.  The flames are now silent within their\r\nrespective tubes, but each of them can be caused to respond to a\r\nproper note sounded anywhere in this room.  With an instrument called\r\na syren, a powerful musical note, of gradually increasing pitch, can\r\nbe produced.  Beginning with a low note, and ascending gradually to a\r\nhigher one, we finally attain the pitch of the flame in the longest\r\ntube.  The moment it is reached, the flame bursts into song.  The\r\nother flames are still silent within their tubes.  But by urging the\r\ninstrument on to higher notes, the second flame is started, and the\r\nthird alone remains.  A still higher note starts it also.  Thus, as\r\nthe sound of the syren rises gradually in pitch, it awakens every\r\nflame in passing, by striking it with a series of waves whose periods\r\nof recurrence are similar to its own.\r\n\r\nNow the wave-motion from the syren is in part taken up by the flame\r\nwhich synchronises with the waves; and were these waves to impinge\r\nupon a multitude of flames, instead of upon one flame only, the\r\ntransference might be so great as to absorb the whole of the original\r\nwave motion.  Let us apply these facts to radiant heat.  This blue\r\nflame is the flame of carbonic oxide; this transparent gas is carbonic\r\nacid gas.  In the blue flame we have carbonic acid intensely heated,\r\nor, in other words, in a state of intense vibration.  It thus\r\nresembles the sounding fork, while this cold carbonic acid resembles\r\nthe silent one.  What is the consequence?  Through the synchronism of\r\nthe hot and cold gas, the waves emitted by the former are intercepted\r\nby the latter, the transmission of the radiant heat being thus\r\nprevented.  The cold gas is intensely opaque to the radiation from\r\nthis particular flame, though highly transparent to heat of every\r\nother kind.  We are here manifestly dealing with that great principle\r\nwhich lies at the basis of spectrum analysis, and which has enabled\r\nscientific men to determine the substances of which the sun, the\r\nstars, and even the nebulae are composed; the principle, namely, that\r\na body which is competent to emit any ray, whether of heat or light,\r\nis competent in the same degree to absorb that ray.  The absorption\r\ndepends on the synchronism existing between the vibrations of the atoms\r\nfrom which the rays, or more correctly the waves, issue, and those of\r\nthe atoms on which they impinge.\r\n\r\nTo its almost total incompetence to emit white light, aqueous vapour\r\nadds a similar incompetence to absorb white light.  It cannot, for\r\nexample, absorb the luminous rays of the sun, though it can absorb the\r\nnon-luminous rays of the earth.  This incompetence of the vapour to\r\nabsorb luminous rays is shared by water and ice--in fact, by all\r\nreally transparent substances.  Their transparency is due to their\r\ninability to absorb luminous rays.  The molecules of such substances\r\nare in dissonance with luminous waves; and hence such waves pass\r\nthrough transparent bodies without disturbing the molecular rest. A\r\npurely luminous beam, however intense may be its heat, is sensibly\r\nincompetent to melt ice.  We can, for example, converge a powerful\r\nluminous beam upon a surface covered with hoar frost, without melting\r\na single spicula of the crystals.  How then, it may be asked, are the\r\nsnows of the Alps swept away by the sunshine of summer?  I answer,\r\nthey are not swept away by sunshine at all, but by rays which have no\r\nsunshine whatever in them.  The luminous rays of the sun fall upon the\r\nsnow-fields and are flashed in echoes from crystal to crystal, but\r\nthey find next to no lodgment within the crystals.  They are hardly at\r\nall absorbed, and hence they cannot produce fusion.  But a body of\r\npowerful dark rays is emitted by the sun; and it is these that cause\r\nthe glaciers to shrink and the snows to disappear; it is they that\r\nfill the banks of the Arve and Arveyron, and liberate from their\r\nfrozen captivity the Rhone and the Rhine.\r\n\r\nPlacing a concave silvered mirror behind the electric light its rays\r\nare converged to a focus of dazzling brilliancy.  Placing in the path\r\nof the rays, between the light and the focus, a vessel of water, and\r\nintroducing at the focus a piece of ice, the ice is not melted by the\r\nconcentrated beam.  Matches, at the same place, are ignited, and wood\r\nis set on fire.  The powerful heat, then, of this luminous beam is\r\nincompetent to melt the ice.  On withdrawing the cell of water, the\r\nice immediately liquefies, and the water trickles from it in drops.\r\nReintroducing the cell of water, the fusion is arrested, and the drops\r\ncease to fall.  The transparent water of the cell exerts no sensible\r\nabsorption on the luminous rays, still it withdraws something from the\r\nbeam, which, when permitted to act, is competent to melt the ice. This\r\nsomething is the dark radiation of the electric light.  Again, I place\r\na slab of pure ice in front of the electric lamp; send a luminous beam\r\nfirst through our cell of water and then through the ice.  By means of\r\na lens an image of the slab is cast upon a white screen.  The beam,\r\nsifted by the water, has little power upon the ice. But observe what\r\noccurs when the water is removed; we have here a star and there a\r\nstar, each star resembling a flower of six petals, and growing visibly\r\nlarger before our eyes.  As the leaves enlarge, their edges become\r\nserrated, but there is no deviation from the six-rayed type.  We have\r\nhere, in fact, the crystallisation of the ice reversed by the\r\ninvisible rays of the electric beam.  They take the molecules down in\r\nthis wonderful way, and reveal to us the exquisite atomic structure of\r\nthe substance with which Nature every winter roofs our ponds and\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\nNumberless effects, apparently anomalous, might be adduced in\r\nillustration of the action of these lightless rays.  These two\r\npowders, for example, are both white, and undistinguishable from each\r\nother by the eye.  The luminous rays of the sun are unabsorbed by\r\nboth--from such rays these powders acquire no heat; still one of them,\r\nsugar, is heated so highly by the concentrated beam of the electric\r\nlamp, that it first smokes and then violently inflames, while the\r\nother substance, salt, is barely warmed at the focus.  Placing two\r\nperfectly transparent liquids in test-tubes at the focus, one of them\r\nboils in a couple of seconds, while the other, in a similar position,\r\nis hardly warmed.  The boiling-point of the first liquid is 78°C,\r\nwhich is speedily reached; that of the second liquid is only 48°C,\r\nwhich is never reached at all.  These anomalies are entirely due to\r\nthe unseen element which mingles with the luminous rays of the\r\nelectric beam, and indeed constitutes 90 per cent.  of its calorific\r\npower.\r\n\r\nA substance, as many of you know, has been discovered, by which these\r\ndark rays may be detached from the total emission of the electric\r\nlamp.  This ray-filter is a liquid, black as pitch to the luminous,\r\nbut bright as a diamond to the non-luminous, radiation.  It\r\nmercilessly cuts off the former, but allows the latter free\r\ntransmission.  When these invisible rays are brought to a focus, at a\r\ndistance of several feet from the electric lamp, the dark rays form an\r\ninvisible image of their source.  By proper means, this image may be\r\ntransformed into a visible one of dazzling brightness.  It might,\r\nmoreover, be shown, if time permitted, how, out of those perfectly\r\ndark rays, could be extracted, by a process of transmutation, all the\r\ncolours of the solar spectrum.  It might also be proved that those\r\nrays, powerful as they are, and sufficient to fuse many metals, can be\r\npermitted to enter the eye, and to break upon the retina, without\r\nproducing the least luminous impression.\r\n\r\nThe dark rays being thus collected, you see nothing at their place of\r\nconvergence.  With a proper thermometer it could be proved that even\r\nthe air at the focus is just as cold as the surrounding air.  And mark\r\nthe conclusion to which this leads.  It proves the aether at the focus\r\nto be practically detached from the air,--that the most violent\r\naethereal motion may there exist, without the least aerial motion.\r\nBut, though you see it not, there is sufficient heat at that focus to\r\nset London on fire.  The heat there is competent to raise iron to a\r\ntemperature at which it throws off brilliant scintillations.  It can\r\nheat platinum to whiteness, and almost fuse that refractory metal.  It\r\nactually can fuse gold, silver, copper, and aluminium.  The moment,\r\nmoreover, that wood is placed at the focus it bursts into a blaze.\r\n\r\nIt has been already affirmed that, whether as regards radiation or\r\nabsorption, the elementary atoms possess but little power.  This might\r\nbe illustrated by a long array of facts; and one of the most singular\r\nof these is furnished by the deportment of that extremely combustible\r\nsubstance, phosphorus, when placed at the dark focus.  It is\r\nimpossible to ignite there a fragment of amorphous phosphorus.  But\r\nordinary phosphorus is a far quicker combustible, and its deportment\r\ntowards radiant heat is still more impressive.  It may be exposed to\r\nthe intense radiation of an ordinary fire without bursting into flame.\r\nIt may also be exposed for twenty or thirty seconds at an obscure\r\nfocus, of sufficient power to raise platinum to a red heat, without\r\nignition.  Notwithstanding the energy of the aethereal waves here\r\nconcentrated, notwithstanding the extremely inflammable character of\r\nthe elementary body exposed to their action, the atoms of that body\r\nrefuse to partake of the motion of the powerful waves of low\r\nrefrangibility, and consequently cannot be affected by their heat.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge we now possess will enable us to analyse with profit a\r\npractical question.  White dresses are worn in summer, because they\r\nare found to be cooler than dark ones.  The celebrated Benjamin\r\nFranklin placed bits of cloth of various colours upon snow, exposed\r\nthem to direct sunshine, and found that they sank to different depths\r\nin the snow.  The black cloth sank deepest, the white did not sink at\r\nall.  Franklin inferred from this experiment that black-bodies are the\r\nbest absorbers, and white ones the worst absorbers, of radiant heat.\r\nLet us test the generality of this conclusion.  One of these two cards\r\nis coated with a very dark powder, and the other with a perfectly\r\nwhite one.  I place the powdered surfaces before a fire, and leave\r\nthem there until they have acquired as high a temperature as they can\r\nattain in this position.  Which of the cards is then most highly\r\nheated?  It requires no thermometer to answer this question. Simply\r\npressing the back of the card, on which the white powder is strewn,\r\nagainst the cheek or forehead, it is found intolerably hot. Placing\r\nthe dark card in the same position, it is found cool.  The white\r\npowder has absorbed far more heat than the dark one.  This simple\r\nresult abolishes a hundred conclusions which have been hastily drawn\r\nfrom the experiments of Franklin.  Again, here are suspended two\r\ndelicate mercurial thermometers at the same distance from a gas-flame.\r\nThe bulb of one of them is covered by a dark substance, the bulb of\r\nthe other by a white one.  Both bulbs have received the radiation from\r\nthe flame, but the white bulb has absorbed most, and its mercury\r\nstands much higher than that of the other thermometer.  This\r\nexperiment might be varied in a hundred ways: it proves that from the\r\ndarkness of a body you can draw no certain conclusion regarding its\r\npower of absorption.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this simply is, that colour gives us intelligence of\r\nonly one portion, and that the smallest one, of the rays impinging on\r\nthe coloured body.  Were the rays all luminous, we might with\r\ncertainty infer from the colour of a body its power of absorption; but\r\nthe great mass of the radiation from our fire, our gas-flame, and even\r\nfrom the sun itself, consists of invisible calorific rays, regarding\r\nwhich colour teaches us nothing.  A body may be highly transparent to\r\nthe one class of rays, and highly opaque to the other.  Thus the white\r\npowder, which has shown itself so powerful an absorber, has been\r\nspecially selected on account of its extreme perviousness to the\r\nvisible rays, and its extreme imperviousness to the invisible ones;\r\nwhile the dark powder was chosen on account of its extreme\r\ntransparency to the invisible, and its extreme opacity to the visible,\r\nrays.  In the case of the radiation from our fire, about 98 per cent\r\nof the whole emission consists of invisible rays; the body, therefore,\r\nwhich was most opaque to these triumphed as an absorber, though that\r\nbody was a white one.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is worth while to consider the manner in which we obtain\r\nfrom natural facts what may be called their intellectual value.\r\nThroughout the processes of Nature we have interdependence and\r\nharmony; and the main value of physics, considered as a mental\r\ndiscipline, consists in the tracing out of this interdependence, and\r\nthe demonstration of this harmony.  The outward and visible phenomena\r\nare the counters of the intellect; and our science would not be worthy\r\nof its name and fame if it halted at facts, however practically\r\nuseful, and neglected the laws which accompany and rule the phenomena.\r\nLet us endeavour, then, to extract from the experiment of Franklin all\r\nthat it can yield, calling to our aid the knowledge which our\r\npredecessors have already stored.  Let us imagine two pieces of cloth\r\nof the same texture, the one black and the other white, placed upon\r\nsunned snow.  Fixing our attention on the white piece, let us enquire\r\nwhether there is any reason to expect that it will sink in the snow at\r\nall.  There is knowledge at hand which enables us to reply at once in\r\nthe negative.  There is, on the contrary, reason to expect that, after\r\na sufficient exposure, the bit of cloth will be found on an eminence\r\ninstead of in a hollow; that instead of a depression, we shall have a\r\nrelative elevation of the bit of cloth.  For, as regards the luminous\r\nrays of the sun, the cloth and the snow are alike powerless; the one\r\ncannot be warmed, nor the other melted, by such rays.  The cloth is\r\nwhite and the snow is white, because their confusedly mingled fibres\r\nand particles are incompetent to absorb the luminous rays.  Whether,\r\nthen, the cloth will sink or not depends entirely upon the dark rays\r\nof the sun.  Now the substance which absorbs these dark rays with the\r\ngreatest avidity is ice,--or snow, which is merely ice in powder.\r\nHence, a less amounts of heat will be lodged in the cloth than in the\r\nsurrounding snow.  The cloth must therefore act as a shield to the\r\nsnow on which it rests; and, in consequence of the more rapid fusion\r\nof the exposed snow, its shield must, in due time, be left behind,\r\nperched upon an eminence like a glacier-table.\r\n\r\nBut though the snow transcends the cloth, both as a radiator and\r\nabsorber, it does not much transcend it.  Cloth is very powerful in\r\nboth these respects.  Let us now turn our attention to the piece of\r\nblack cloth, the texture and fabric of which I assume to be the same\r\nas that of the white.  For our object being to compare the effects of\r\ncolour, we must, in order to study this effect in its purity, preserve\r\nall the other conditions constant.  Let us then suppose the black\r\ncloth to be obtained from the dyeing of the white.  The cloth itself,\r\nwithout reference to the dye, is nearly as good an absorber of heat as\r\nthe snow around it.  But to the absorption of the dark solar rays by\r\nthe undyed cloth, is now added the absorption of the whole of the\r\nluminous rays, and this great additional influx of heat is far more\r\nthan sufficient to turn the balance in favour of the black cloth.  The\r\nsum of its actions on the dark and luminous rays, exceeds the action\r\nof the snow on the dark rays alone.  Hence the cloth will sink in the\r\nsnow, and this is the complete analysis of Franklin's experiments.\r\n\r\nThroughout this discourse the main stress has been laid on chemical\r\nconstitution, as influencing most powerfully the phenomena of\r\nradiation and absorption.\r\n\r\nWith regard to gases and vapours, and to the liquids from which these\r\nvapours are derived, it has been proved by the most varied and\r\nconclusive experiments that the acts of radiation and absorption are\r\nmolecular--that they depend upon chemical, and not upon mechanical,\r\ncondition.  In attempting to extend this principle to solids I was met\r\nby a multitude of facts, obtained by celebrated experimenters, which\r\nseemed flatly to forbid such an extension.  Mellon, for example, had\r\nfound the same radiant and absorbent power for chalk and lamp-black.\r\nMM. Masson and Courtépée had performed a most elaborate series of\r\nexperiments on chemical precipitates of various kinds, and found that\r\nthey one and all manifested the same power of radiation.  They\r\nconcluded from their researches, that when bodies are reduced to an\r\nextremely fine state of division, the influence of this state is so\r\npowerful as entirely to mask and override whatever influence may be\r\ndue to chemical constitution.\r\n\r\nBut it appears to me that through the whole of these researches an\r\noversight has run, the mere mention of which will show what caution is\r\nessential in the operations of experimental philosophy; while an\r\nexperiments or two will make clear wherein the oversight consists.\r\nFilling a brightly polished metal cube with boiling water, I determine\r\nthe quantity of heat emitted by two of the bright surfaces.  As a\r\nradiator of heat one of them far transcends the other.  Both surfaces\r\nappear to be metallic; what, then, is the cause of the observed\r\ndifference in their radiative power?  Simply this: one of the surfaces\r\nis coated with transparent gum, through which, of course, is seen the\r\nmetallic lustre behind; and this varnish, though so perfectly\r\ntransparent to luminous rays, is as opaque as pitch, or lamp-black, to\r\nnon-luminous ones.  It is a powerful emitter of dark rays; it is also\r\na powerful absorber.  While, therefore, at the present moment, it is\r\ncopiously pouring forth radiant heat itself, it does not allow a\r\nsingle ray from the metal behind to pass through it.  The varnish\r\nthen, and not the metal, is the real radiator.\r\n\r\nNow Melloni, and Masson, and Courtépée experimented thus: they mixed\r\ntheir powders and precipitates with gum-water, and laid them, by means\r\nof a brush, upon the surfaces of a cube like this.  True, they saw\r\ntheir red powders red, their white ones white, and their black ones\r\nblack, but they saw these colours _through the coat of varnish which\r\nsurrounded every particle_.  When, therefore, it was concluded that\r\ncolour had no influence on radiation, no chance had been given to it\r\nof asserting its influence; when it was found that all chemical\r\nprecipitates radiated alike, it was the radiation from a varnish,\r\ncommon to them all, which showed the observed constancy.  Hundreds,\r\nperhaps thousands, of experiments on radiant heat have been performed\r\nin this way, by various enquirers, but the work will, I fear, have to\r\nbe done over again.  I am not, indeed, acquainted with an instance in\r\nwhich an oversight of so trivial a character has been committed by so\r\nmany able men in succession, vitiating so large an amounts of\r\notherwise excellent work.  Basing our reasonings thus on demonstrated\r\nfacts, we arrive at the extremely probable conclusion that the\r\nenvelope of the particles, and not the particles themselves, was the\r\nreal radiator in the experiments just referred to.  To reason thus,\r\nand deduce their more or less probable consequences from experimental\r\nfacts, is an incessant exercise of the student of physical science.\r\nBut having thus followed, for a time, the light of reason alone\r\nthrough a series of phenomena, and emerged from them with a purely\r\nintellectual conclusion, our duty is to bring that conclusion to an\r\nexperimental test. In this way we fortify our science.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of testing our conclusion regarding the influence of\r\nthe gum, I take two powders presenting the same physical appearance;\r\none of them is a compound of mercury, and the other a compound of\r\nlead.  On two surfaces of a cube are spread these bright red powders,\r\nwithout varnish of any kind.  Filling the cube with boiling water, and\r\ndetermining the radiation from the two surfaces, one of them is found\r\nto emit thirty-nine units of heat, while the other emits seventy-four.\r\nThis, surely, is a great difference.  Here, however, is a second cube,\r\nhaving two of its surfaces coated with the same powders, the only\r\ndifference being that the powders are laid on by means of a\r\ntransparent gum.  Both surfaces are now absolutely alike in radiative\r\npower.  Both of them emit somewhat more than was emitted by either of\r\nthe unvarnished powders, simply because the gum employed is a better\r\nradiator than either of them.  Excluding all varnish, and comparing\r\nwhite with white, vast differences are found; comparing black with\r\nblack, they are also different; and when black and white are compared,\r\nin some cases the black radiates far more than the white, while in\r\nother cases the white radiates far more than the black.  Determining,\r\nmoreover, the absorptive power of those powders, it is found to go\r\nhand-in-hand with their radiative power.  The good radiator is a good\r\nabsorber, and the bad radiator is a bad absorber.  From all this it is\r\nevident that as regards the radiation and absorption of non-luminous\r\nheat, colour teaches us nothing; and that even as regards the\r\nradiation of the sun, consisting as it does mainly of non-luminous\r\nrays, conclusions as to the influence of colour may be altogether\r\ndelusive.  This is the strict scientific upshot of our researches. But\r\nit is not the less true that in the case of wearing apparel--and this\r\nfor reasons which I have given in analysing the experiments of\r\nFranklin--black dresses are more potent than white ones as absorbers\r\nof solar heat.\r\n\r\nThus, in brief outline, have been brought before you a few of the\r\nresults of recent enquiry.  If you ask me what is the use of them, I\r\ncan hardly answer you, unless you define the term use.  If you meant\r\nto ask whether those dark rays which clear away the Alpine snows, will\r\never be applied to the roasting of turkeys, or the driving of\r\nsteam-engines--while affirming their power to do both, I would frankly\r\nconfess that they are not at present capable of competing profitably\r\nwith coal in these particulars.  Still they may have great uses\r\nunknown to me; and when our coal-fields are exhausted, it is possible\r\nthat a more aethereal race than we are may cook their victuals, and\r\nperform their work, in this transcendental way.  But is it necessary\r\nthat the student of science should have his labours tested by their\r\npossible practical applications?  What is the practical value of\r\nHomer's Iliad?  You smile, and possibly think that Homer's Iliad is\r\ngood as a means of culture.  There's the rub.  The people who demand\r\nof science practical uses, forget, or do not know, that it also is\r\ngreat as a means of culture--that the knowledge of this wonderful\r\nuniverse is a thing profitable in itself, and requiring no practical\r\napplication to justify its pursuit.\r\n\r\nBut while the student of Nature distinctly refuses to have his labours\r\njudged by their practical issues, unless the term practical be made to\r\ninclude mental as well as material good, he knows full well that the\r\ngreatest practical triumphs have been episodes in the search after\r\npure natural truth.  The electric telegraph is the standing wonder of\r\nthis age, and the men whose scientific knowledge, and mechanical\r\nskill, have made the telegraph what it is, are deserving of all\r\nhonour.  In fact, they have had their reward, both in reputation and\r\nin those more substantial benefits which the direct service of the\r\npublic always carries in its train.  But who, I would ask, put the\r\nsoul into this telegraphic body?  Who snatched from heaven the fire\r\nthat flashes along the line?  This, I am bound to say, was done by two\r\nmen, the one a dweller in Italy, [Footnote: Volta] the other a\r\ndweller in England, [Footnote: Faraday] who never in their enquiries\r\nconsciously set a practical object before them--whose only stimulus\r\nwas the fascination which draws the climber to a never-trodden peak,\r\nand would have made Caesar quit his victories for the sources of the\r\nNile.  That the knowledge brought to us by those prophets, priests,\r\nand kings of science is what the world calls 'useful knowledge,' the\r\ntriumphant application of their discoveries proves.  But science has\r\nanother function to fulfil, in the storing and the training of the\r\nhuman mind; and I would base my appeal to you on the specimen which\r\nhas this evening been brought before you, whether any system of\r\neducation at the present day can be deemed even approximately\r\ncomplete, in which the knowledge of Nature is neglected or ignored.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nIV.  NEW CHEMICAL REACTIONS PRODUCED BY LIGHT.\r\n\r\n1868-69.\r\n\r\n1 DECOMPOSITION BY LIGHT.\r\n\r\nMEASURED by their power, not to excite vision, but to produce heat--in\r\nother words, measured by their absolute energy--the ultra-red waves of\r\nthe sun and of the electric light, as shown in the preceding articles,\r\nfar transcend the visible.  In the domain of chemistry, however, there\r\nare numerous cases in which the more powerful waves are ineffectual,\r\nwhile the more minute waves, through what may be called their\r\ntimeliness of application, are able to produce great effects.  A\r\nseries of these, of a novel and beautiful character, discovered in\r\n1868, and further illustrated in subsequent years, may be exhibited by\r\nsubjecting the vapours of volatile liquids to the action of\r\nconcentrated sunlight, or to the concentrated beam of the electric\r\nlight.  Their investigation led up to the discourse on 'Dust and\r\nDisease' which follows in this volume; and for this reason some\r\naccount of them is introduced here.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nA glass tube 3 feet long and 3 inches wide, which had been frequently\r\nemployed in my researches on radiant heat, was supported horizontally\r\non two stands.  At one end of the tube was placed an electric lamp,\r\nthe height and position of both being so arranged, that the axis of\r\nthe tube, and that of the beam issuing from the lamp, were coincident.\r\nIn the first experiments the two ends of the tube were closed by\r\nplates of rock-salt, and subsequently by plates of glass.  For the\r\nsake of distinction, I call this tube the experimental tube.  It was\r\nconnected with an air-pump, and also with a series of drying and other\r\ntubes used for the purification of the air.\r\n\r\nA number of test-tubes, like F, fig. 2 (I have used at least fifty of\r\nthem), were converted into Woulf's flasks.  Each of them was stopped\r\nby a cork, through which passed two glass tubes: one of these tubes\r\n(a) ended immediately below the cork, while the other (b) descended to\r\nthe bottom of the flask, being drawn out at its lower end to an\r\norifice about 0.03 of an inch in diameter.  It was found necessary to\r\ncoat the cork carefully with cement.  In the later experiments corks\r\nof vulcanised India-rubber were invariably employed.\r\n\r\nThe little flask, thus formed, being partially filled with the liquid\r\nwhose vapour was to be examined, was introduced into the path of the\r\npurified current of air.  The experimental tube being exhausted, and\r\nthe cock which cut off the supply of purified air being cautiously\r\nturned on, the air entered the flask through the tube b, and escaped\r\nby the small orifice at the lower end of b into the liquid.  Through\r\nthis it bubbled, loading itself with vapour, after which the mixed air\r\nand vapour, passing from the flask by the tube a, entered the\r\nexperimental tube, where they were subjected to the action of light.\r\n\r\nThe whole arrangement is shown in fig. 3, where L represents the\r\nelectric lamp, ss' the experimental tube, pp' the pipe leading to the\r\nair-pump, and F the test-tube containing the volatile liquid.  The\r\ntube tt' is plugged with cotton-wool intended to intercept the\r\nfloating matter of the air; the bent tube T' contains caustic potash,\r\nthe tube T sulphuric acid, the one intended to remove the carbonic\r\nacid and the other the aqueous vapour of the air.\r\n\r\nThe power of the electric beam to reveal the existence of anything\r\nwithin the experimental tube, or the impurities of the tube itself, is\r\nextraordinary.  When the experiments is made in a darkened room, a\r\ntube which in ordinary daylight appears absolutely clean, is often\r\nshown by the present mode of examination to be exceedingly filthy.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the results obtained with this arrangement:\r\n\r\nNitrite of amyl.  The vapour of this liquid was in the first instance\r\npermitted to enter the experimental tube, while the beam from the\r\nelectric lamp was passing through it.  Curious clouds, the cause of\r\nwhich was then unknown, were observed to form near the place of entry,\r\nbeing afterwards whirled through the tube.\r\n\r\nThe tube being again exhausted, the mixed air and vapour were allowed\r\nto enter it in the dark.  The slightly convergent beam of the electric\r\nlight was then sent through the mixture.  For a moment the tube was\r\n_optically empty_, nothing whatever being seen within it; but before a\r\nsecond had elapsed a shower of particles was precipitated on the beam.\r\nThe cloud thus generated became denser as the light continued to act,\r\nslowing at some places vivid iridescence.\r\n\r\nThe lens of the electric lamp was now placed so as to form within the\r\ntube a strongly convergent cone of rays.  The tube was cleansed and\r\nagain filled in darkness.  When the light was sent through it, the\r\nprecipitation upon the beam was so rapid and intense that the cone,\r\nwhich a moment before was invisible, flashed suddenly forth like a\r\nsolid luminous spear.  The effect was the same when the air and vapour\r\nwere allowed to enter the tube in diffuse daylight.  The cloud,\r\nhowever, which shone with such extraordinary radiance under the\r\nelectric beam, was invisible in the ordinary light of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of mixed air and vapour within the experimental tube\r\ncould of course be regulated at pleasure.  The rapidity of the action\r\ndiminished with the attenuation of the vapour.  When, for example, the\r\nmercurial column associated with the experimental tube was depressed\r\nonly five inches, the action was not nearly so rapid as when the tube\r\nwas full.  In such cases, however, it was exceedingly interesting to\r\nobserve, after some seconds of waiting, a thin streamer of delicate\r\nbluish-white cloud slowly forming along the axis of the tube, and\r\nfinally swelling so as to fill it.\r\n\r\nFig.  2.\r\n\r\nFig.  3.\r\n\r\nWhen dry oxygen was employed to carry in the vapour the effect was the\r\nsame as that obtained with air.\r\n\r\nWhen dry hydrogen was used as a vehicle, the effect was also the same.\r\n\r\nThe effect, therefore, is not due to any interaction between the\r\nvapour of the nitrite and its vehicle.\r\n\r\nThis was further demonstrated by the deportment of the vapour itself.\r\nWhen it was permitted to enter the experimental tube unmixed with air\r\nor any other gas, the effect was substantially the same.  Hence the\r\nseat of the observed action is the vapour.\r\n\r\nThis action is not to be ascribed to heat.  As regards the glass of\r\nthe experimental tube, and the air within the tube, the beam employed\r\nin these experiments was perfectly cold.  It had been sifted by\r\npassing it through a solution of alum, and through the thick\r\ndouble-convex lens of the lamp.  When the unsifted beam of the lamp\r\nwas employed, the effect was still the same; the obscure calorific\r\nrays did not appear to interfere with the result.\r\n\r\nMy object here being simply to point out to chemists a method of\r\nexperiments which reveals a new and beautiful series of reactions, I\r\nleft to them the examination of the products of decomposition.  The\r\ngroup of atoms forming the molecule of nitrite of amyl is obviously\r\nshaken asunder by certain specific waves of the electric beam, nitric\r\noxide and other products, of which the _nitrate_ of amyl is probably\r\none, being the result of the decomposition.  The brown fumes of\r\nnitrous acid were seen mingling with the cloud within the experimental\r\ntube.  The nitrate of amyl, being less volatile than the nitrite, and\r\nnot being able to maintain itself in the condition of vapour, would be\r\nprecipitated as a visible cloud along the track of the beam.\r\n\r\nIn the anterior portions of the tube a powerful sifting of the beam by\r\nthe vapour occurs, which diminishes the chemical action in the\r\nposterior portions.  In some experiments the precipitated cloud only\r\nextended halfway down the tube.  When, under these circumstances, the\r\nlamp was shifted so as to send the beam through the other end of the\r\ntube, copious precipitation occurred there also.\r\n\r\nSolar light also effects the decomposition of the nitrite-of-amyl\r\nvapour.  On October 10, 1868, I partially darkened a small room in the\r\nRoyal Institution, into which the sun shone, permitting the light to\r\nenter through an open portion of the window-shutter.  In the track of\r\nthe beam was placed a large plano-convex lens, which formed a fine\r\nconvergent cone in the dust of the room behind it.  The experimental\r\ntube was filled in the laboratory, covered with a black cloth, and\r\ncarried into the partially darkened room.  On thrusting one end of the\r\ntube into the cone of rays behind the lens, precipitation within the\r\ncone was copious and immediate.  The vapour at the distant end of the\r\ntube was in part shielded by that in front, and was also more feebly\r\nacted on through the divergence of the rays.  On reversing the tube, a\r\nsecond and similar cone was precipitated.\r\n\r\nPhysical Considerations.\r\n\r\nI sought to determine the particular portion of the light which\r\nproduced the foregoing effects.  When, previous to entering the\r\nexperimental tube, the beam was caused to pass through a red glass,\r\nthe effect was greatly weakened, but not extinguished.  This was also\r\nthe case with various samples of yellow glass.  A blue glass being\r\nintroduced before the removal of the yellow or the red, on taking the\r\nlatter away prompt precipitation occurred along the track of the blue\r\nbeam.  Hence, in this case, the more refrangible rays are the most\r\nchemically active.  The colour of the liquid nitrite of amyl indicates\r\nthat this must be the case; it is a feeble but distinct yellow: in\r\nother words, the yellow portion of the beam is most freely\r\ntransmitted.  It is not, however, the transmitted portion of any beam\r\nwhich produces chemical action, but the absorbed portion.  Blue, as\r\nthe complementary colour to yellow, is here absorbed, and hence the\r\nmore energetic action of the blue rays.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning, however, assumes that the same rays are absorbed by\r\nthe liquid and its vapour.  The assumption is worth testing.  A\r\nsolution of the yellow chromate of potash, the colour of which may be\r\nmade almost, if not altogether, identical with that of the liquid\r\nnitrite of amyl, was found far more effective in stopping the chemical\r\nrays than either the red or the yellow glass.  But of all substances\r\nthe liquid nitrite itself is most potent in arresting the rays which\r\nact upon its vapour.  A layer one-eighth of an inch in thickness,\r\nwhich scarcely perceptibly affected the luminous intensity, absorbed\r\nthe entire chemical energy of the concentrated beam of the electric\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe close relation subsisting between a liquid and its vapour, as\r\nregards their action upon radiant heat, has been already amply\r\ndemonstrated. [Footnote: 'Phil. Trans.' 1864; 'Heat, a Mode of\r\nMotion,' chap, xii; and P. 61 of this volume.]  As regards the nitrite\r\nof amyl, this relation is more specific than in the cases hitherto\r\nadduced; for here the special constituent of the beam, which provokes\r\nthe decomposition of the vapour, is shown to be arrested by the\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nA question of extreme importance in molecular physics here arises:\r\nWhat is the real mechanism of this absorption, and where is its seat?\r\n[Footnote: My attention was very forcibly directed to this subject\r\nsome years ago by a conversation with my excellent friend Professor\r\nClausius.]\r\n\r\nI figure, as others do, a molecule as a group of atoms, held together\r\nby their mutual forces, but still capable of motion among themselves.\r\nThe vapour of the nitrite of amyl is to be regarded as an assemblage\r\nof such molecules.  The question now before us is this: In the act of\r\nabsorption, is it the molecules that are effective, or is it their\r\nconstituent atoms?  Is the _vis viva_ of the intercepted light-waves\r\ntransferred to the molecule as a whole, or to its constituent parts?\r\n\r\nThe molecule, as a whole, can only vibrate in virtue of the forces\r\nexerted between it and its neighbour molecules.  The intensity of\r\nthese forces, and consequently the rate of vibration, would, in this\r\ncase, be a function of the distance between the molecules.  Now the\r\nidentical absorption of the liquid and of the vaporous nitrite of amyl\r\nindicates an identical vibrating period on the part of liquid and\r\nvapour, and this, to my mind, amounts to an experimental proof that\r\nthe absorption occurs in the main _within_ the molecule.  For it can\r\nhardly be supposed, if the absorption were the act of the molecule as\r\na whole, that it could continue to affect waves of the same period\r\nafter the substance had passed from the vaporous to the liquid state.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the decomposition of the nitrite of amyl is itself\r\nto some extent an illustration of this internal molecular absorption;\r\nfor were the absorption the act of the molecule as a whole, the\r\nrelative motions of its constituent atoms would remain unchanged, and\r\nthere would be no mechanical cause for their separation.  It is\r\nprobably the synchronism of the vibrations of one portion of the\r\nmolecule with the incident waves, that enables the amplitude of those\r\nvibrations to augment, until the chain which binds the parts of the\r\nmolecule together is snapped asunder.\r\n\r\nI anticipate wide, if not entire, generality for the fact that a\r\nliquid and its vapour absorb the same rays.  A cell of liquid chlorine\r\nwould, I imagine, deprive light more effectually of its power of\r\ncausing chlorine and hydrogen to combine than any other filter of the\r\nluminous rays.  The rays which give chlorine its colour have nothing\r\nto do with this combination, those that are absorbed by the chlorine\r\nbeing really effective rays.  A highly sensitive bulb, containing\r\nchlorine and hydrogen, in the exact proportions necessary for the\r\nformation of hydrochloric acid, was placed at one end of an\r\nexperimental tube, the beam of the electric lamp being sent through it\r\nfrom the other.  The bulb did not explode when the tube was filled\r\nwith chlorine, while the explosion was violent and immediate when the\r\ntube was filled with air.  I anticipate for the liquid chlorine an\r\naction similar to, but still more energetic than, that exhibited by\r\nthe gas.  If this should prove to be the case, it will favour the view\r\nthat chlorine itself is _molecular_ and not _monatomic_.\r\n\r\nProduction of Sky-blue by the Decomposition of Nitrite of Amyl.\r\n\r\nWhen the quantity of nitrite vapour is considerable, and the light\r\nintense, the chemical action is exceedingly rapid, the particles\r\nprecipitated being so large as to whiten the luminous beam.  Not so,\r\nhowever, when a well-mixed and highly attenuated vapour fills the\r\nexperimental tube.  The effect now to be described was first obtained\r\nwhen the vapour of the nitrite was derived from a portion of its\r\nliquid which had been accidentally introduced into the passage through\r\nwhich the dry air flowed into the experimental tube.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the electric beam traversed the tube for several seconds\r\nbefore any action was visible.  Decomposition then visibly commenced,\r\nand advanced slowly.  When the light was very strong, the cloud\r\nappeared of a milky blue.  When, on the contrary, the intensity was\r\nmoderate, the blue was pure and deep.  In Brücke's important\r\nexperiments on the blue of the sky and the morning and evening red,\r\npure mastic is dissolved in alcohol, and then dropped into water well\r\nstirred.  When the proportion of mastic to alcohol is correct, the\r\nresin is precipitated so finely as to elude the highest microscopic\r\npower.  By reflected light, such a medium appears bluish, by\r\ntransmitted light yellowish, which latter colour, by augmenting the\r\nquantity of the precipitate, can be caused to pass into orange or red.\r\n\r\nBut the development of colour in the attenuated nitrite-of-amyl vapour\r\nis doubtless more similar to what takes place in our atmosphere.  The\r\nblue, moreover, is far purer and more sky-like than that obtained from\r\nBruecke's turbid medium.  Never, even in the skies of the Alps, have I\r\nseen a richer or a purer blue than that attainable by a suitable\r\ndisposition of the light falling upon the precipitated vapour.\r\n\r\nIodide of Allyl.--Among the liquids hitherto subjected to the\r\nconcentrated electric light, iodide of allyl, in point of rapidity and\r\nintensity of action, comes next to the nitrite of amyl.  With the\r\niodide I have employed both oxygen and hydrogen, as well as air, as a\r\nvehicle, and found the effect in all cases substantially the same. The\r\ncloud-column here was exquisitely beautiful.  It revolved round the\r\naxis of the decomposing beam; it was nipped at certain places like an\r\nhour-glass, and round the two bells of the glass delicate\r\ncloud-filaments twisted themselves in spirals.  It also folded itself\r\ninto convolutions resembling those of shells.  In certain conditions\r\nof the atmosphere in the Alps I have often observed clouds of a\r\nspecial pearly lustre; when hydrogen was made the vehicle of the\r\niodide-of allyl vapour a similar lustre was most exquisitely shown.\r\nWith a suitable disposition of the light, the purple hue of\r\niodine-vapour came out very strongly in the tube.\r\n\r\nThe remark already made, as to the bearing of the decomposition of\r\nnitrite of amyl by light on the question of molecular absorption,\r\napplies here also; for were the absorption the work of the molecule as\r\na whole, the iodine would not be dislodged from the allyl with which\r\nit is combined.  The non-synchronism of iodine with the waves of\r\nobscure heat is illustrated by its marvellous transparency to such\r\nheat.  May not its synchronism with the waves of light in the present\r\ninstance be the cause of its divorce from the allyl?\r\n\r\nIodide of Isopropyl.--The action of light upon the vapour of this\r\nliquid is, at first, more languid than upon iodide of allyl; indeed\r\nmany beautiful reactions may be overlooked, in consequence of this\r\nlanguor at the commencement.  After some minutes' exposure, however,\r\nclouds begin to form, which grow in density and in beauty as the light\r\ncontinues to act.  In every experiment hitherto made with this\r\nsubstance the column of cloud filling the experimental tube, was\r\ndivided into two distinct parts near the middle of the tube.  In one\r\nexperiments a globe of cloud formed at the centre, from which, right\r\nand left, issued an axis uniting the globe with two adjacent\r\ncylinders.  Both globe and cylinders were animated by a common motion\r\nof rotation.  As the action continued, paroxysms of motion were\r\nmanifested; the various parts of the cloud would rush through each\r\nother with sudden violence.  During these motions beautiful and\r\ngrotesque cloud-forms were developed.  At some places the nebulous\r\nmass would become ribbed so as to resemble the graining of wood; a\r\nlongitudinal motion would at times generate in it a series of curved,\r\ntransverse bands, the retarding influence of the sides the tube\r\ncausing an appearance resembling, on a small scale, the dirt-bands of\r\nthe Mer de Glace.  In the anterior portion of the tube those sudden\r\ncommotion were most intense; here buds of cloud would sprout forth,\r\nand grow in a few seconds into perfect flower-like forms.  The cloud\r\nof iodide of isopropyl had a character Of its own, and differed\r\nmaterially from all others that I had seen.  A gorgeous mauve colour\r\nwas observed in the last twelve inches of the tube; the vapour of\r\niodine was present, and it may have been the sky-blue scattered by the\r\nprecipitated particles which, mingling with the purple of the iodine,\r\nproduced the mauve.  As in all other cases here adduced, the effects\r\nwere proved to be due to the light; they never occurred in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe forms assumed by some of those actinic clouds, as I propose to\r\ncall them, in consequence of rotations and other motions, due to\r\ndifferences of temperature, are perfectly astounding.  I content\r\nmyself here with a meagre description of one more of them.\r\n\r\nThe tube being filled with the sensitive mixture, the beam was sent\r\nthrough it, the lens at the same time being so placed as to produce a\r\ncone of very intense light.  Two minutes elapsed before anything was\r\nvisible; but at the end of this time a faint bluish cloud appeared to\r\nhang itself on the most concentrated portion of the beam.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards a second cloud was formed five inches farther down the\r\nexperimental tube.  Both clouds were united by a slender cord of the\r\nsame bluish tint as themselves.\r\n\r\nAs the action of the light continued, the first cloud gradually\r\nresolved itself into a series of parallel disks of exquisite delicacy,\r\nwhich rotated round an axis perpendicular to their surfaces, and\r\nfinally blended to a screw surface with an inclined generatrix.  This\r\ngradually changed into a filmy funnel, from the narrow end of which\r\nthe 'cord' extended to the cloud in advance.\r\n\r\nThe latter also underwent slow but incessant modification.  It first\r\nresolved itself into a series of strata resembling those of the\r\nelectric discharge.  After a little time, and through changes which it\r\nwas difficult to follow, both clouds presented the appearance of a\r\nseries of concentric funnels set one within the other, the interior\r\nones being seen through the outer ones.  Those of the distant cloud\r\nresembled claret-glasses in shape.  As many as six funnels were thus\r\nconcentrically set together, the two series being united by the\r\ndelicate cord of cloud already referred to.  Other cords and Blender\r\ntubes were afterwards formed, which coiled themselves in delicate\r\nspirals around the funnels.\r\n\r\nRendering the light along the connecting-cord more intense, it\r\ndiminished in thickness and became whiter; this was a consequence of\r\nthe enlargement of its particles.  The cord finally disappeared, while\r\nthe funnels melted into two ghost-like films, shaped like parasols.\r\nThey were barely visible, being of an exceedingly delicate blue tint.\r\nThey seemed woven of blue air.  To compare them with cobweb or with\r\ngauze would be to liken them to something infinitely grosser than\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn all cases a distant candle-flame, when looked at through the cloud,\r\nwas sensibly undimmed.\r\n\r\n2.  ON THE BLUE COLOUR OF THE SKY, AND THE POLARISATION OF SKYLIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: In my 'Lectures on Light' (Longman), the polarisation of\r\nlight will be found briefly, but, I trust, clearly explained.]\r\n\r\n1869.\r\n\r\nAfter the communication to the Royal Society of the foregoing brief\r\naccount of a new Series of Chemical Reactions produced by Light, the\r\nexperiments upon this subject were continued, the number of substances\r\nthus acted on being considerably increased.\r\n\r\nI now, however, beg to direct attention to two questions glanced at\r\nincidentally in the preceding pages--the blue colour of the sky, and\r\nthe polarisation of skylight.  Reserving the historic treatment of the\r\nsubject for a more fitting occasion, I would merely mention now that\r\nthese questions constitute, in the opinion of our most eminent\r\nauthorities, the two great standing enigmas of meteorology.  Indeed it\r\nwas the interest manifested in them by Sir John Herschel, in a letter\r\nof singular speculative power, addressed to myself, that caused me to\r\nenter upon the consideration of these questions so soon.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus with which I work consists, as already stated, of a\r\nglass tube about a yard in length, and from 2.5 to 3 inches internal\r\ndiameter.  The vapour to be examined is introduced into this tube in\r\nthe manner already described, and upon it the condensed beam of the\r\nelectric lamp is permitted to act, until the neutrality or the\r\nactivity of the substance has been declared.\r\n\r\nIt has hitherto been my aim to render the chemical action of light\r\nupon vapours visible.  For this purpose substances have been chosen,\r\none at least of whose products of decomposition under light shall have\r\na boiling-point so high, that as soon as the substance is formed it\r\nshall be precipitated.  By graduating the quantity of the vapour, this\r\nprecipitation may be rendered of any degree of fineness, forming\r\nparticles distinguishable by the naked eye, or far beyond the reach of\r\nour highest microscopic powers.  I have no reason to doubt that\r\nparticles may be thus obtained, whose diameters constitute but a small\r\nfraction of the length of a wave of violet light.\r\n\r\nIn all cases when the vapours of the liquids employed are sufficiently\r\nattenuated, no matter what the liquid may be, the visible action\r\ncommences with the formation of a _blue cloud_.  But here I must guard\r\nmyself against all misconception as to the use of this term.  The\r\n'cloud' here referred to is totally invisible in ordinary daylight. To\r\nbe seen, it requires to be surrounded by darkness, _it only_ being\r\nilluminated by a powerful beam of light.  This blue cloud differs in\r\nmany important particulars from the finest ordinary clouds, and might\r\njustly have assigned to it an intermediate position between such\r\nclouds and true vapour.  With this explanation, the term 'cloud,' or\r\n'incipient cloud,' or 'actinic cloud,' as I propose to employ it,\r\ncannot, I think, be misunderstood.\r\n\r\nI had been endeavouring to decompose carbonic acid gas by light.  A\r\nfaint bluish cloud, due it may be, or it may not be, to the residue of\r\nsome vapour previously employed, was formed in the experimental tube.\r\nOn looking across this cloud through a Nicol's prism, the line of\r\nvision being horizontal, it was found that when the short diagonal of\r\nthe prism was vertical, the quantity of light reaching the eye was\r\ngreater than when the long diagonal was vertical.  When a plate of\r\ntourmaline was held between the eye and the bluish cloud, the quantity\r\nof light reaching the eye when the axis of the prism was perpendicular\r\nto the axis of the illuminating beam, was greater than when the axes\r\nof the crystal and of the beam were parallel to each other.\r\n\r\nThis was the result all round the experimental tube.  Causing the\r\ncrystal of tourmaline to revolve round the tube, with its axis\r\nperpendicular to the illuminating beam, the quantity of light that\r\nreached the eye was in all its positions a maximum.  When the\r\ncrystallographic axis was parallel to the axis of the beam, the\r\nquantity of light transmitted by the crystal was a minimum.\r\n\r\nFrom the illuminated bluish cloud, therefore, polarised light was\r\ndischarged, the direction of maximum polarisation being at right\r\nangles to the illuminating beam; the plane of vibration of the\r\npolarised light was perpendicular to the beam. [Footnote: This is\r\nstill an undecided point; but the probabilities are so much in its\r\nfavour, and it is in my opinion so much preferable to have a physical\r\nimage on which the mind can rest, that I do not hesitate to employ the\r\nphraseology in the text.]\r\n\r\nThin plates of selenite or of quartz, placed between the Nicol and the\r\nactinic cloud, displayed the colours of polarised light, these colours\r\nbeing most vivid when the line of vision was at right angles to the\r\nexperimental tube.  The plate of selenite usually employed was a\r\ncircle, thinnest at the centre, and augmenting uniformly in thickness\r\nfrom the centre outwards.  When placed in its proper position between\r\nthe Nicol and the cloud, it exhibited a system of splendidly-coloured\r\nrings.\r\n\r\nThe cloud here referred to was the first operated upon in the manner\r\ndescribed.  It may, however, be greatly improved upon by the choice of\r\nproper substances, and by the application, in proper quantities, of\r\nthe substances chosen.  Benzol, bisulphide of carbon, nitrite of amyl,\r\nnitrite of butyl, iodide of allyl, iodide of isopropyl, and many other\r\nsubstances may be employed.  I will take the nitrite of butyl as\r\nillustrative of the means adopted to secure the best result, with\r\nreference to the present question.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may be mentioned that a vapour, which when alone, or mixed\r\nwith air in the experimental tube, resists the action of light, or\r\nshows but a feeble result of this action, may, when placed in\r\nproximity with another gas or vapour, exhibit vigorous, if not violent\r\naction.  The case is similar to that of carbonic acid gas, which,\r\ndiffused in the atmosphere, resists the decomposing action of solar\r\nlight, but when placed in contiguity with chlorophyl in the leaves of\r\nplants, has its molecules shaken asunder.\r\n\r\nDry air was permitted to bubble through the liquid nitrite of butyl,\r\nuntil the experimental tube, which had been previously exhausted, was\r\nfilled with the mixed air and vapour.  The visible action of light\r\nupon the mixture after fifteen minutes' exposure was slight.  The tube\r\nwas afterwards filled with half an atmosphere of the mixed air and\r\nvapour, and a second half-atmosphere of air which had been permitted\r\nto bubble through fresh commercial hydrochloric acid.  On sending the\r\nbeam through this mixture, the tube, for a moment, was optically\r\nempty.  But the pause amounted only to a small fraction of a second, a\r\ndense cloud being immediately precipitated upon the beam.\r\n\r\nThis cloud began blue, but the advance to whiteness was so rapid as\r\nalmost to justify the application of the term instantaneous.  The\r\ndense cloud, looked at perpendicularly to its axis, showed scarcely\r\nany signs of polarisation.  Looked at obliquely the polarisation was\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nThe experimental tube being again cleansed and exhausted, the mixed\r\nair and nitrite-of-butyl vapour was permitted to enter it until the\r\nassociated mercury column was depressed 1/10 of an inch.  In other\r\nwords, the air and vapour, united, exercised a pressure not exceeding\r\n1/300th of an atmosphere.  Air, passed through a solution of\r\nhydrochloric acid, was then added, till the mercury column was\r\ndepressed three inches.  The condensed beam of the electric light was\r\npassed for some time through this mixture without revealing anything\r\nwithin the tube competent to scatter the light.  Soon, however, a\r\nsuperbly blue cloud was formed along, the track of the beam, and it\r\ncontinued blue sufficiently long to permit of its thorough\r\nexamination.  The light discharged from the cloud, at right angles to\r\nits own length, was at first perfectly polarised.  It could be totally\r\nquenched by the Nicol.  By degrees the cloud became of whitish blue,\r\nand for a time the selenite colours, obtained by looking at it\r\nnormally, were exceedingly brilliant.  The direction of maximum\r\npolarisation was distinctly at right angles to the illuminating beam.\r\nThis continued to be the case as long as the cloud maintained a\r\ndecided blue colour, and even for some time after the blue had changed\r\nto whitish blue.  But, as the light continued to act, the cloud became\r\ncoarser and whiter, particularly at its centre, where it at length\r\nceased to discharge polarised light in the direction of the\r\nperpendicular, while it continued to do so at both ends.\r\n\r\nBut the cloud which had thus ceased to polarise the light emitted\r\nnormally, showed vivid selenite colours when looked at obliquely,\r\nproving that the direction of maximum polarisation changed with the\r\ntexture of the cloud.  This point shall receive further illustration\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nA blue, equally rich and more durable, was obtained by employing the\r\nnitrite-of-butyl vapour in a still more attenuated condition.  The\r\ninstance here cited is representative.  In all cases, and with all\r\nsubstances, the cloud formed at the commencement, when the\r\nprecipitated particles are sufficiently fine, is _blue_, and it can be\r\nmade to display a colour rivalling that of the purest Italian sky.  In\r\nall cases, moreover, this fine blue cloud polarises _perfectly_ the beam\r\nwhich illuminates it, the direction of polarisation enclosing an angle\r\nof 90° with the axis of the illuminating beam.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly interesting to observe both the perfection and the\r\ndecay of this polarisation.  For ten or fifteen minutes after its\r\nfirst appearance the light from a vividly illuminated actinic cloud,\r\nlooked at perpendicularly, is absolutely quenched by a Nicol's prism\r\nwith its longer diagonal vertical.  But as the sky-blue is gradually\r\nrendered impure by the growth of the particles--in other words, as\r\nreal clouds begin to be formed--the polarisation begins to decay, a\r\nportion of the light passing through the prism in all its positions.\r\nIt is worthy of note, that for some time after the cessation of\r\nperfect polarisation, the residual light which passes, when the Nicol\r\nis in its position of minimum transmission, is of a gorgeous blue, the\r\nwhiter light of the cloud being extinguished. [Footnote: This shows\r\nthat particles too large to polarise the blue, polarise perfectly\r\nlight of lower refrangibility.]  When the cloud texture has become\r\nsufficiently coarse to approximate to that of ordinary clouds, the\r\nrotation of the Nicol ceases to have any sensible effect on the\r\nquantity of light discharged normally.\r\n\r\nThe perfection of the polarisation, in a direction perpendicular to\r\nthe illuminating beam, is also illustrated by the following\r\nexperiments: A Nicol's prism, large enough to embrace the entire beam\r\nof the electric lamp, was placed between the lamp and the experimental\r\ntube.  A few bubbles of air, carried through the liquid nitrite of\r\nbutyl, were introduced into the tube, and they were followed by about\r\nthree inches (measured by the mercurial gauge) of air which had passed\r\nthrough aqueous hydrochloric acid.  Sending the polarised beam through\r\nthe tube, I placed myself in front of it, my eye being on a level with\r\nits axis, my assistant occupying a similar position behind the tube.\r\nThe short diagonal of the large Nicol was in the first instance\r\nvertical, the plane of vibration of the emergent beam being therefore\r\nalso vertical.  As the light continued to act, a superb blue cloud,\r\nvisible to both my assistant and myself, was slowly formed.  But this\r\ncloud, so deep and rich when looked at from the positions mentioned,\r\n_utterly disappeared when looked at vertically downwards, or vertically\r\nupwards_.  Reflection from the cloud was not possible in these\r\ndirections.  When the large Nicol was slowly turned round its axis,\r\nthe eye of the observer being on the level of the beam, and the line\r\nof vision perpendicular to it, entire extinction of the light emitted\r\nhorizontally occurred when the longer diagonal of the large Nicol was\r\nvertical.  But now a vivid blue cloud was seen when looked at\r\ndownwards or upwards.  This truly fine experiments, which I\r\ncontemplated making on my own account, was first definitely suggested\r\nby a remark in a letter addressed to me by Professor Stokes.\r\n\r\nAs regards the polarisation of skylight, the greatest stumbling-block\r\nhas hitherto been, that, in accordance with the law of Brewster, which\r\nmakes the index of refraction the tangent of the polarising angle, the\r\nreflection which produces perfect polarisation would require to be\r\nmade in air upon air; and indeed this led many of our most eminent\r\nmen, Brewster himself among the number, to entertain the idea of\r\naerial molecular reflection. [Footnote: 'The cause of the\r\npolarisation is evidently a reflection of the sun's light upon\r\nsomething.  The question is on what?  Were the angle of maximum\r\npolarisation 76°, we should look to water or ice as the reflecting\r\nbody, however inconceivable the existence in a cloudless atmosphere\r\nand a hot summer's day of unevaporated molecules (particles?) of\r\nwater.  But though we were once of this opinion, careful observation\r\nhas satisfied us that 90°, or thereabouts, is the correct angle, and\r\nthat therefore whatever be the body on which the light has been\r\nreflected, if polarised by a single reflection, the polarising angle\r\nmust be 45°, and the index of refraction, which is the tangent of that\r\nangle, unity; in other words, the reflection would require to be made\r\nin air upon air!' (Sir John Herschel, 'Meteorology,' par.  233.)\r\n\r\nAny particles, if small enough, will produce both the colour and the\r\npolarisation of the sky.  But is the existence of small\r\nwater-particles on a hot summer's day in the higher regions of our\r\natmosphere inconceivable?  It is to be remembered that the oxygen and\r\nnitrogen of the air behave as a vacuum to radiant heat, the\r\nexceedingly attenuated vapour of the higher atmosphere being therefore\r\nin practical contact with the cold of space.]\r\n\r\nI have, however, operated upon substances of widely different\r\nrefractive indices, and therefore of very different polarising angles\r\nas ordinarily defined, but the polarisation of the beam, by the\r\nincipient cloud, has thus far proved itself to be absolutely\r\nindependent of the polarising angle.  The law of Brewster does not\r\napply to matter in this condition, and it rests with the undulatory\r\ntheory to explain why.  Whenever the precipitated particles are\r\nsufficiently fine, no matter what the substance forming the particles\r\nmay be, the direction of maximum polarisation is at right angles to\r\nthe illuminating beam, the polarising angle for matter in this\r\ncondition being invariably 45°.\r\n\r\nSuppose our atmosphere surrounded by an envelope impervious to light,\r\nbut with an aperture on the sunward side through which a parallel beam\r\nof solar light could enter and traverse the atmosphere.  Surrounded by\r\nair not directly illuminated, the track of such a beam would resemble\r\nthat of the parallel beam of the electric lamp through an incipient\r\ncloud.  The sunbeam would be blue, and it would discharge laterally\r\nlight in precisely the same condition as that discharged by the\r\nincipient cloud.  In fact, the azure revealed by such a beam would be\r\nto all intents and purposes that which I have called a 'blue cloud.'\r\nConversely our 'blue cloud' is, to all intents and purposes, an\r\n_artificial sky_.' [Footnote: The opinion of Sir John Herschel,\r\nconnecting the polarisation and the blue colour of the sky, is\r\nverified by the foregoing results.  'The more the subject [the\r\npolarisation of skylight] is considered,' writes this eminent\r\nphilosopher, 'the more it will be found beset with difficulties, and\r\nits explanation when arrived at will probably be found to carry with\r\nit that of the blue colour of the sky itself, and of the great\r\nquantity of light it actually does send down to us.'  'We may observe,\r\ntoo,' he adds, 'that it is only where the purity of the sky is most\r\nabsolute that the polarisation is developed in its highest degree, and\r\nthat where there is the slightest perceptible tendency to cirrus it is\r\nmaterially impaired.' This applies word for word to our 'incipient\r\nclouds.']\r\n\r\nBut, as regards the polarisation of the sky, we know that not only is\r\nthe direction of maximum polarisation at right angles to the track of\r\nthe solar beams, but that at certain angular distances, probably\r\nvariable ones, from the sun, 'neutral points,' or points of no\r\npolarisation, exist, on both sides of which the planes of atmospheric\r\npolarisation are at right angles to each other.  I have made various\r\nobservations upon this subject which are reserved for the present;\r\nbut, pending the more complete examination of the question, the\r\nfollowing facts bearing upon it may be submitted.\r\n\r\nThe parallel beam employed in these experiments tracked its way\r\nthrough the laboratory air, exactly as sunbeams are seen to do in the\r\ndusty air of London.  I have reason to believe that a great portion of\r\nthe matter thus floating in the laboratory air consists of organic\r\nparticles, which are capable of imparting a perceptibly bluish tint to\r\nthe air.  These also showed, though far less vividly, all the effects\r\nof polarisation obtained with the incipient clouds.  The light\r\ndischarged laterally from the track of the illuminating beam was\r\npolarised, though not perfectly, the direction of maximum polarisation\r\nbeing at right angles to the beam.  At all points of the beam,\r\nmoreover, throughout its entire length, the light emitted normally was\r\nin the same state of polarisation.  Keeping the positions of the Nicol\r\nand the selenite constant, the same colours were observed throughout\r\nthe entire beam, when the line of vision was perpendicular to its\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal column of air, thus illuminated, was 18 feet long, and\r\ncould therefore be looked at very obliquely.  I placed myself near the\r\nend of the beam, as it issued from the electric lamp, and, looking\r\nthrough the Nicol and selenite more and more obliquely at the beam,\r\nobserved the colours fading until they disappeared.  Augmenting the\r\nobliquity the colours appeared once more, but they were now\r\ncomplementary to the former ones.\r\n\r\nHence this beam, like the sky, exhibited a neutral point, on opposite\r\nsides of which the light was polarised in planes at right angles to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThinking that the action observed in the laboratory might be caused,\r\nin some way, by the vaporous fumes diffused in its air, I had the\r\nlight removed to a room at the top of the Royal Institution.  The\r\ntrack of the beam was seen very finely in the air of this room, a\r\nlength of 14 or 15 feet being attainable.  This beam exhibited all the\r\neffects observed with the beam in the laboratory.  Even the\r\nuncondensed electric light falling on the floating matter showed,\r\nthough faintly, the effects of polarisation.\r\n\r\nWhen the air was so sifted as to entirely remove the visible floating\r\nmatter, it no longer exerted any sensible action upon the light, but\r\nbehaved like a vacuum.  The light is scattered and polarised by\r\n_particles_, not by molecules or atoms.\r\n\r\nBy operating upon the fumes of chloride of ammonium, the smoke of\r\nbrown paper, and tobacco-smoke, I had varied and confirmed in many\r\nways those experiments on neutral points, when my attention was drawn\r\nby Sir Charles Wheatstone to an important observation communicated to\r\nthe Paris Academy in 1860 by Professor Govi, of Turin. [Footnote:\r\nComptes Rendus,' tome li, pp. 360 and 669.] M. Govi had been led to\r\nexamine a beam of light sent through a room in which were successively\r\ndiffused the smoke of incense, and tobacco-smoke.  His first brief\r\ncommunication stated the fact of polarisation by such smoke; but in\r\nhis second communication he announced the discovery of a neutral point\r\nin the beam, at the opposite sides of which the light was polarised in\r\nplanes at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\nBut unlike my observations on the laboratory air, and unlike the\r\naction of the sky, the direction of maximum polarisation in M. Govi's\r\nexperiments enclosed a very small angle with the axis of the\r\nilluminating beam.  The question was left in this condition, and I am\r\nnot aware that M. Govi or any other investigator has pursued it\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nI had noticed, as before stated, that as the clouds formed in the\r\nexperimental tube became denser, the polarisation of the light\r\ndischarged at right angles to the beam became weaker, the direction of\r\nmaximum polarisation becoming oblique to the beam.  Experiments on the\r\nfumes of chloride of ammonium gave me also reason to suspect that the\r\nposition of the neutral point was not constant, but that it varied\r\nwith the density of the illuminated fumes.\r\n\r\nThe examination of these questions led to the following new and\r\nremarkable results: The laboratory being well filled with the fumes of\r\nincense, and sufficient time being allowed for their uniform\r\ndiffusion, the electric beam was sent through the smoke.  From the\r\ntrack of the beam polarised light was discharged; but the direction of\r\nmaximum polarisation, instead of being perpendicular, now enclosed an\r\nangle of only 12° or 13° with the axis of the beam.\r\n\r\nA neutral point, with complementary effects at opposite sides of it,\r\nwas also exhibited by the beam.  The angle enclosed by the axis of the\r\nbeam, and a line drawn from the neutral point to the observer's eye,\r\nmeasured in the first instance 66°.\r\n\r\nThe windows of the laboratory were now opened for some minutes, a\r\nportion of the incense-smoke being permitted to escape.  On again\r\ndarkening the room and turning on the light, the line of vision to the\r\nneutral point was found to enclose, with the axis of the beam, an\r\nangle of 63°.\r\n\r\nThe windows were again opened for a few minutes, more of the smoke\r\nbeing permitted to escape.  Measured as before, the angle referred to\r\nwas found to be 54°.\r\n\r\nThis process was repeated three additional times the neutral point was\r\nfound to recede lower and lower down the beam, the angle between a\r\nline drawn from the eye to the neutral point and the axis of the beam\r\nfalling successively from 54° to 49°, 43° and 33°.\r\n\r\nThe distances, roughly measured, of the neutral point from the lamp,\r\ncorresponding to the foregoing series of observations, were these:\r\n\r\n1st observation   2 feet 2 inches.\r\n\r\n2nd observation   2 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\n3rd observation   2 feet 10 inches.\r\n\r\n4th observation   3 feet 2 inches.\r\n\r\n5th observation   3 feet 7 inches.\r\n\r\n6th observation   4 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this series of experiments the direction of maximum\r\npolarisation had again become normal to the beam.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory was next filled with the fumes of gunpowder.  In five\r\nsuccessive experiments, corresponding to five different densities of\r\nthe gunpowder-smoke, the angles enclosed between the line of vision to\r\nthe neutral point and the axis of the beam, were 63 degrees, 50°, 47°,\r\n42°, and 38° respectively.\r\n\r\nAfter the clouds of gunpowder had cleared away, the laboratory was\r\nfilled with the fumes of common resin, rendered so dense as to be very\r\nirritating to the lungs.  The direction of maximum polarisation\r\nenclosed, in this case, an angle of 12°, or thereabouts, with the axis\r\nof the beam.  Looked at, as in the former instances, from a position\r\nnear the electric lamp, no neutral point was observed throughout the\r\nentire extent of the beam.\r\n\r\nWhen this beam was looked at normally through the selenite and Nicol,\r\nthe ring-system, though not brilliant, was distinct.  Keeping the eye\r\nupon the plate of selenite, and the line of vision perpendicular, the\r\nwindows were opened, the blinds remaining undrawn.  The resinous fumes\r\nslowly diminished, and as they did so the ring-system became paler. It\r\nfinally disappeared.  Continuing to look in the same direction, the\r\nrings revived, but now the colours were complementary to the former\r\nones.  _The neutral point had passed me in its motion down the beam,\r\nconsequent upon the attenuation of the fumes of resin_.\r\n\r\nWith the fumes of chloride of ammonium substantially the same results\r\nwere obtained.  Sufficient, however, has been here stated to\r\nillustrate the variability of the position of the neutral\r\npoint. [Footnote: Brewster has proved the variability of the position\r\nof the neutral point for skylight with the sun's altitude, a result\r\nobviously connected with the foregoing experiments.]\r\n\r\nBy a puff of tobacco-smoke, or of condensed steam, blown into the\r\nilluminated beam, the brilliancy of the selenite colours may be\r\ngreatly enhanced.  But with different clouds two different effects are\r\nproduced.  Let the ring-system observed in the common air be brought\r\nto its maximum strength, and then let an attenuated cloud of chloride\r\nof ammonium be thrown into the beam at the point looked at; the ring\r\nsystem flashes out with augmented brilliancy, but the character of the\r\npolarisation remains unchanged.  This is also the case when\r\nphosphorus, or sulphur, is burned underneath the beam, so as to cause\r\nthe fine particles of phosphorus or of sulphur to rise into the light.\r\nWith the sulphur-fumes the brilliancy of the colours is exceedingly\r\nintensified; but in none of these cases is there any change in the\r\ncharacter of the polarisation.\r\n\r\nBut when a puff of the fumes of hydrochloric acid, hydriodic acid, or\r\nnitric acid is thrown into the beam, there is a complete reversal of\r\nthe selenite tints.  Each of these clouds twists the plane of\r\npolarisation 90°, causing the centre of the ring-system to change from\r\nblack to white, and the rings themselves to emit their complementary\r\ncolours. [Footnote: Sir John Herschel suggested to me that this\r\nchange of the polarisation from positive to negative may indicate a\r\nchange from polarisation by reflection to polarisation by refraction.\r\nThis thought repeatedly occurred to me while looking at the effects;\r\nbut it will require much following up before it emerges into\r\nclearness.]\r\n\r\nAlmost all liquids have motes in them sufficiently numerous to\r\npolarise sensibly the light, and very beautiful effects may be\r\nobtained by simple artificial devices.  When, for example, a cell of\r\ndistilled water is placed in front of the electric lamp, and a thin\r\nslice of the beam is permitted to pass through it, scarcely any\r\npolarised light is discharged, and scarcely any colour produced with a\r\nplate of selenite. But if a bit of soap be agitated in the water above\r\nthe beam, the moment the infinitesimal particles reach the light the\r\nliquid sends forth laterally almost perfectly polarised light; and if\r\nthe selenite be employed, vivid colours flash into existence.  A still\r\nmore brilliant result is obtained with mastic dissolved in a great\r\nexcess of alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe selenite rings, in fact, constitute an extremely delicate test as\r\nto the collective quantity of individually invisible particles in a\r\nliquid.  Commencing with distilled water, for example, a thick slice\r\nof light is necessary to make the polarisation of its suspended\r\nparticles sensible.  A much thinner slice suffices for common water;\r\nwhile, with Bruecke's precipitated mastic, a slice too thin to produce\r\nany sensible effect with most other liquids, suffices to bring out\r\nvividly the selenite colours.\r\n\r\n3.  THE SKY OF THE ALPS.\r\n\r\nThe vision of an object always implies a differential action on the\r\nretina of the observer.  The object is distinguished from surrounding\r\nspace by its excess or defect of light in relation to that space.  By\r\naltering the illumination, either of the object itself or of its\r\nenvironment, we alter the appearance of the object.  Take the case of\r\nclouds floating in the atmosphere with patches of blue between them.\r\nAnything that changes the illumination of either alters the appearance\r\nof both, that appearance depending, as stated, upon differential\r\naction.\r\n\r\nNow the light of the sky, being polarised, may, as the reader of the\r\nforegoing pages knows, be in great part quenched by a Nicol's prism,\r\nwhile the light of a common cloud, being unpolarised, cannot be thus\r\nextinguished.  Hence the possibility of very remarkable variations,\r\nnot only in the aspect of the firmament, which is really changed, but\r\nalso in the aspect of the clouds, which have that firmament as a\r\nbackground.  It is possible, for example, to choose clouds of such a\r\ndepth of shade that when the Nicol quenches the light behind them,\r\nthey shall vanish, being undistinguishable from the residual dull tint\r\nwhich outlives the extinction of the brilliancy of the sky.  A cloud\r\nless deeply shaded, but still deep enough, when viewed with the naked\r\neye, to appear dark on a bright ground, is suddenly changed to a white\r\ncloud on a dark ground by the quenching of the light behind it.  When\r\na reddish cloud at sunset chances to float in the region of maximum\r\npolarisation, the quenching of the surrounding light causes it to\r\nflash with a brighter crimson. Last Easter eve the Dartmoor sky, which\r\nhad just been cleansed by a snow-storm, wore a very wild appearance.\r\nRound the horizon it was of steely brilliancy, while reddish cumuli\r\nand cirri floated southwards. When the sky was quenched behind them\r\nthese floating masses seemed like dull embers suddenly blown upon;\r\nthey brightened like a fire.\r\n\r\nIn the Alps we have the most magnificent examples of crimson clouds\r\nand snows, so that the effects just referred to may be here studied\r\nunder the best possible conditions.  On August 23, 1869, the evening\r\nAlpenglow was very fine, though it did not reach its maximum depth and\r\nsplendour.  The side of the Weisshorn seen from the Bel Alp, being\r\nturned from the sun, was tinted mauve; but I wished to observe one of\r\nthe rose-coloured buttresses of the mountain.  Such a one was visible\r\nfrom a point a few hundred feet above the hotel.  The Matterhorn also,\r\nthough for the most part in shade, had a crimson projection, while a\r\ndeep ruddy red lingered along its western shoulder.  Four distinct\r\npeaks and buttresses of the Dom, in addition to its dominant head--all\r\ncovered with pure snow--were reddened by the light of sunset.  The\r\nshoulder of the Alphubel was similarly coloured, while the great mass\r\nof the Fletschorn was all a-glow, and so was the snowy spine of the\r\nMonte Leone.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Weisshorn through the Nicol, the glow of its\r\nprotuberance was strong or weak according to the position of the\r\nprism.  The summit also underwent striking changes.  In one position\r\nof the prism it exhibited a pale white against a dark background; in\r\nthe rectangular position it was a dark mauve against a light\r\nbackground.  The red of the Matterhorn changed in a similar manner;\r\nbut the whole mountain also passed through wonderful changes of\r\ndefinition.  The air at the time was filled with a silvery haze, in\r\nwhich the Matterhorn almost disappeared.  This could be wholly\r\nquenched by the Nicol, and then the mountain sprang forth with\r\nastonishing solidity and detachment from the surrounding air.  The\r\nchanges of the Dom were still more wonderful.  A vast amounts of light\r\ncould be removed from the sky behind it, for it occupied the position\r\nof maximum polarisation.  By a little practice with the Nicol it was\r\neasy to render the extinction of the light, or its restoration, almost\r\ninstantaneous.  When the sky was quenched, the four minor peaks and\r\nbuttresses, and the summit of the Dom, together with the shoulder of\r\nthe Alphubel, glowed as if set suddenly on fire.  This was immediately\r\ndimmed by turning the Nicol through an angle of 90°.  It was not the\r\nstoppage of the light of the sky behind the mountains alone which\r\nproduced this startling effect; the air between them and me was highly\r\nopalescent, and the quenching of this intermediate glare augmented\r\nremarkably the distinctness of the mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 24 similar effects were finely shown.  At 10\r\nA.M. all three mountains, the Dom, the Matterhorn, and the Weisshorn,\r\nwere powerfully affected by the Nicol.  But in this instance also, the\r\nline drawn to the Dom being very nearly perpendicular to the solar\r\nbeams, the effects on this mountain were most striking.  The grey\r\nsummit of the Matterhorn, at the same time, could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished from the opalescent haze around it; but when the Nicol\r\nquenched the haze, the summit became instantly isolated, and stood out\r\nin bold definition.  It is to be remembered that in the production of\r\nthese effects the only things changed are the sky behind, and the\r\nluminous haze in front of the mountains; that these are changed\r\nbecause the light emitted from the sky and from the haze is plane\r\npolarised light, and that the light from the snows and from the\r\nmountains, being sensibly unpolarised, is not directly affected by the\r\nNicol.  It will also be understood that it is not the interposition of\r\nthe haze _as an opaque body_ that renders the mountains indistinct, but\r\nthat it is the _light_ of the haze which dims and bewilders the eye, and\r\nthus weakens the definition of objects seen through it.\r\n\r\nThese results have a direct bearing upon what artists call 'aerial\r\nperspective.' As we look from the summit of Mont Blanc, or from a\r\nlower elevation, at the serried crowd of peaks, especially if the\r\nmountains be darkly coloured--covered with pines, for example--every\r\npeak and ridge is separated from the mountains behind it by a thin\r\nblue haze which renders the relations of the mountains as to distance\r\nunmistakable.  When this haze is regarded through the Nicol\r\nperpendicular to the sun's rays, it is in many cases wholly quenched,\r\nbecause the light which it emits in this direction is wholly\r\npolarised.  When this happens, aerial perspective is abolished, and\r\nmountains very differently distant appear to rise in the same vertical\r\nplane.  Close to the Bel Alp for instance, is the gorge of the Massa,\r\nand beyond the gorge is a high ridge darkened by pines.  This ridge\r\nmay be projected upon the dark slopes at the opposite side of the\r\nRhone valley, and between both we have the blue haze referred to,\r\nthrowing the distant mountains far away.  But at certain hours of the\r\nday the haze may be quenched, and then the Massa ridge and the\r\nmountains beyond the Rhone seem almost equally distant from the eye.\r\nThe one appears, as it were, a vertical continuation of the other. The\r\nhaze varies with the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere. At\r\ncertain times and places it is almost as blue as the sky itself; but\r\nto see its colour, the attention must be withdrawn from the mountains\r\nand from the trees which cover them.  In point of fact, the haze is a\r\npiece of more or less perfect sky; it is produced in the same manner,\r\nand is subject to the same laws, as the firmament itself. We live _in_\r\nthe sky, not _under_ it.\r\n\r\nThese points were further elucidated by the deportment of the\r\nselenite, plate, with which the readers of the foregoing pages\r\nare so well acquainted.  On some of the sunny days of August the\r\nhaze in the valley of the Rhone, as looked at from the Bel Alp,\r\nwas very remarkable.  Towards evening the sky above the mountains\r\nopposite to my place of observation yielded a series of the most\r\nsplendidly-coloured iris-rings; but on lowering the selenite until it\r\nhad the darkness of the pines at the opposite side of the Rhone\r\n'valley, instead of the darkness of space, as a background, the\r\ncolours were not much diminished in brilliancy.  I should estimate the\r\ndistance across the valley, as the crow flies, to the opposite\r\nmountain, at nine miles; so that a body of air of this thickness can,\r\nunder favourable circumstances, produce chromatic effects of\r\npolarisation almost as vivid as those produced by the sky itself.\r\n\r\nAgain: the light of a landscape, as of most other things, consists of\r\ntwo parts; the one, coming purely from superficial reflection, is\r\nalways of the same colour as the light which falls upon the landscape;\r\nthe other part reaches us from a certain depth within the objects\r\nwhich compose the landscape, and it is this portion of the total light\r\nwhich gives these objects their distinctive colours.  The white light\r\nof the sun enters all substances to a certain depth, and is partly\r\nejected by internal reflection; each distinct substance absorbing and\r\nreflecting the light, in accordance with the laws of its own molecular\r\nconstitution. Thus the solar light is _sifted_ by the landscape, which\r\nappears in such colours and variations of colour as, after the sifting\r\nprocess, reach the observer's eye.  Thus the bright green of grass, or\r\nthe darker colour of the pine, never comes to us alone, but is always\r\nmingled with an amounts of light derived from superficial reflection.\r\nA certain hard brilliancy is conferred upon the woods and meadows by\r\nthis superficially-reflected light.  Under certain circumstances, it\r\nmay be quenched by a Nicol's prism, and we then obtain the true colour\r\nof the grass and foliage.  Trees and meadows, thus regarded, exhibit a\r\nrichness and softness of tint which they never show as long as the\r\nsuperficial light is permitted to mingle with the true interior\r\nemission.  The needles of the pines show this effect very well,\r\nlarge-leaved trees still better; while a glimmering field of maize\r\nexhibits the most extraordinary variations when looked at through the\r\nrotating Nicol.\r\n\r\nThoughts and questions like those here referred to took me, in August\r\n1869, to the top of the Aletschhorn.  The effects described in the\r\nforegoing paragraphs were for the most part reproduced on the summit\r\nof the mountain.  I scanned the whole of the sky with my Nicol.  Both\r\nalone, and in conjunction with the selenite, it pronounced the\r\nperpendicular to the solar beams to be the direction of maximum\r\npolarisation.\r\n\r\nBut at no portion of the firmament was the polarisation complete.  The\r\nartificial sky produced in the experiments recorded in the preceding\r\npages could, in this respect, be rendered far more perfect than the\r\nnatural one; while the gorgeous 'residual blue' which makes its\r\nappearance when the polarisation of the artificial sky ceases to be\r\nperfect, was strongly contrasted with the lack-lustre hue which, in\r\nthe case of the firmament, outlived the extinction of the brilliancy.\r\nWith certain substances, however, artificially treated, this dull\r\nresidue may also be obtained.\r\n\r\nAll along the arc from the Matterhorn to Mont Blanc the light of the\r\nsky immediately above the mountains was powerfully acted upon by the\r\nNicol.  In some cases the variations of intensity were astonishing.  I\r\nhave already said that a little practice enables the observer to shift\r\nthe Nicol from one position to another so rapidly as to render the\r\nalternative extinction and restoration of the light immediate.  When\r\nthis was done along the arc to which I have referred, the alternations\r\nof light and darkness resembled the play of sheet lightning behind the\r\nmountains.  There was an element of awe connected with the suddenness\r\nwith which the mighty masses, ranged along the line referred to,\r\nchanged their aspect and definition under the operation of the prism.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe physical reason of the blueness of both natural and artificial\r\nskies is, I trust, correctly given in the essay on the Scientific use\r\nof the Imagination published in the second volume of these Fragments.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nV. ON DUST AND DISEASE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A discourse delivered before the Royal Institution of Great\r\nBritain, January 21, 1870.]\r\n\r\nExperiments on Dusty Air.\r\n\r\nSOLAR light, in passing through a dark room, reveals its track by\r\nilluminating the dust floating in the air.  'The sun,' says Daniel\r\nCulverwell, 'discovers atomes, though they be invisible by\r\ncandle-light, and makes them dance naked in his beams.'\r\n\r\nIn my researches on the decomposition of vapours by light, I was\r\ncompelled to remove these 'atoms' and this dust. It was essential that\r\nthe space containing the vapours should embrace no visible thing--that\r\nno substance capable of scattering light in the slightest sensible\r\ndegree should, at the outset of an experiments, be found in the wide\r\n'experimental tube' in which the vapour was enclosed.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I was troubled by the appearance there of floating\r\nmatter, which, though invisible in diffuse daylight, was at once\r\nrevealed by a powerfully condensed beam.  Two U-tubes were placed in\r\nsuccession in the path of the air, before it entered the liquid whose\r\nvapour was to be carried into the experimental tube.  One of the\r\nU-tubes contained fragments of marble wetted with a strong solution of\r\ncaustic potash; the other, fragments of glass wetted with concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid which, while yielding no vapour of its own, powerfully\r\nabsorbs the aqueous vapour of the air. [Footnote: The apparatus is\r\nfigured in Fig. 3.]  To my astonishment, the air of the Royal\r\nInstitution, sent through these tubes at a rate sufficiently slow to\r\ndry it, and to remove its carbonic acid, carried into the experimental\r\ntube a considerable amounts of mechanically suspended matter, which\r\nwas illuminated when the beam passed through the tube.  The effect was\r\nsubstantially the same when the air was permitted to bubble through\r\nthe liquid acid, and through the solution of potash.\r\n\r\nI tried to intercept this floating matter in various ways; and on\r\nOctober 5, 1868, prior to sending the air through the drying\r\napparatus, it was carefully permitted to pass over the tip of a\r\nspirit-lamp flame.  The floating matter no longer appeared, having\r\nbeen burnt up by the flame.  It was therefore _organic matter_.  I was\r\nby no means prepared for this result; having previously thought that\r\nthe dust of our air was, in great part, inorganic and non-combustible.\r\n[Footnote: According to an analysis kindly furnished to me by Dr.\r\nPercy, the dust collected _from the walls_ of the British Museum\r\ncontains fully 50 per cent.  of inorganic matter.  I have every\r\nconfidence in the results of this distinguished chemist; they show\r\nthat the _floating_ dust of our rooms is, as it were, winnowed from the\r\nheavier matter.  As bearing directly upon this point I may quote the\r\nfollowing passage from Pasteur: 'Mais ici se présente une remarque: la\r\npoussière que Pon trouve à la surface de tous les corps est soumise\r\nconstamment à des courants d'air, qui doivent soulever des particules\r\nles plus légères, au nombre desquelles se trouvent, sans doute, de\r\npréférence les corpuscules organisés, oeufs ou spores, moins lourds\r\ngénéralement que les particules minérales.']\r\n\r\nI had constructed a small gas-furnace, now much employed by chemists,\r\ncontaining a platinum tube, which could be heated to vivid redness.\r\n[Footnote: Pasteur was, I believe, the first to employ such a tube.]\r\nThe tube contained a roll of platinum gauze, which, while it permitted\r\nthe air to pass through it, ensured the practical contact of the dust\r\nwith the incandescent metal.  The air of the laboratory was permitted\r\nto enter the experimental tube, sometimes through the cold, and\r\nsometimes through the heated, tube of platinum.  In the first column\r\nof the following fragment of a long table the quantity of air operated\r\non is expressed by the depression of the mercury gauge of the\r\nair-pump.  In the second column the condition of the platinum tube is\r\nmentioned, and in the third the state of the air in the experimental\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nQuantity of air   State of platinum tube  State of experimental tube\r\n\r\n15 inches                 Cold                  Full of particles.\r\n\r\n30 inches                 Red-hot               Optically empty.\r\n\r\nThe phrase 'optically empty' shows that when the conditions of perfect\r\ncombustion were present, the floating matter totally disappeared.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIn a cylindrical beam, which strongly illuminated the dust of the\r\nlaboratory, I placed an ignited spirit-lamp.  Mingling with the flame,\r\nand round its rim, were seen curious wreaths of darkness resembling an\r\nintensely black smoke.  On placing the flame at some distance below\r\nthe beam, the same dark masses stormed upwards.  They were blacker\r\nthan the blackest smoke ever seen issuing from the funnel of a\r\nsteamer; and their resemblance to smoke was so perfect as to lead the\r\nmost practised observer to conclude that the apparently pure flame of\r\nthe alcohol lamp required but a beam of sufficient intensity to reveal\r\nits clouds of liberated carbon.  But is the blackness smoke?  This\r\nquestion presented itself in a moment and was thus answered: A red-hot\r\npoker was placed underneath the beam: from it the black wreaths also\r\nascended.  A large hydrogen flame was next employed, and it produced\r\nthose whirling masses of darkness, far more copiously than either the\r\nspirit-flame or poker. Smoke was therefore out of the question.\r\n[Footnote: In none of the public rooms of the United States where I\r\nhad the honour to lecture was this experiment made.  The organic dust\r\nwas too scanty.  Certain rooms in England--the Brighton Pavilion, for\r\nexample--also lack the necessary conditions.]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the blackness?  It was simply that of stellar space;\r\nthat is to say, blackness resulting from the absence from the track of\r\nthe beam of all matter competent to scatter its light.  When the flame\r\nwas placed below the beam the floating matter was destroyed _in situ_;\r\nand the air, freed from this matter, rose into the beam, jostled aside\r\nthe illuminated particles, and substituted for their light the\r\ndarkness due to its own perfect transparency.  Nothing could more\r\nforcibly illustrate the invisibility of the agent which renders all\r\nthings visible.  The beam crossed, unseen, the black chasm formed by\r\nthe transparent air, while, at both sides of the gap, the thick-strewn\r\nparticles shone out like a luminous solid under the powerful\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, necessary to burn the particles to produce a\r\nstream of darkness.  Without actual combustion, currents may be\r\ngenerated which shall displace the floating matter, and appear dark\r\namid the surrounding brightness.  I noticed this effect first on\r\nplacing a red-hot copper ball below the beam, and permitting it to\r\nremain there until its temperature had fallen below that of boiling\r\nwater.  The dark currents, though much enfeebled, were still produced.\r\nThey may also be produced by a flask filled with hot water.\r\n\r\nTo study this effect a platinum wire was stretched across the beam,\r\nthe two ends of the wire being connected with the two poles of a\r\nvoltaic battery.  To regulate the strength of the current a rheostat\r\nwas placed in the circuit.  Beginning with a feeble current the\r\ntemperature of the wire was gradually augmented; but long before it\r\nreached the heat of ignition, a flat stream of air rose from it, which\r\nwhen looked at edgeways appeared darker and sharper than one of the\r\nblackest lines of Fraunhofer in the purified spectrum.  Right and left\r\nof this dark vertical band the floating matter rose upwards, bounding\r\ndefinitely the non-luminous stream of air.  What is the explanation?\r\nSimply this: The hot wire rarefied the air in contact with it, but it\r\ndid not equally lighten the floating matter.  The convection current\r\nof pure air therefore passed upwards among the inert particles,\r\ndragging them after it right and left, but forming between them an\r\nimpassable black partition.  This elementary experiments enables us to\r\nrender an account of the dark currents produced by bodies at a\r\ntemperature below that of combustion.\r\n\r\nBut when the platinum wire is intensely heated, the floating matter is\r\nnot only displaced, but destroyed.  I stretched a wire about 4 inches\r\nlong through the air of an ordinary glass shade resting on\r\ncotton-wool, which also surrounded the rim.  The wire being raised to\r\na white heat by an electric current, the air expanded, and some of it\r\nwas forced through the cotton-wool.  When the current was interrupted,\r\nand the air within the shade cooled, the returning air did not carry\r\nmotes along with it, being filtered by the wool.  At the beginning of\r\nthis experiments the shade was charged with floating matter; at the\r\nend of half an hour it was optically empty.\r\n\r\nOn the wooden base of a cubical glass shade, a cubic foot in volume,\r\nupright supports were fixed, and from one support to the other 38\r\ninches of platinum wire were stretched in four parallel lines.  The\r\nends of the platinum wire were soldered to two stout copper wires\r\nwhich passed through the base of the shade and could be connected with\r\na battery.  As in the last experiments the shade rested upon\r\ncotton-wool.  A beam sent through the shade revealed the suspended\r\nmatter.  The platinum wire was then raised to whiteness.  In five\r\nminutes there was a sensible diminution of the matter, and in ten\r\nminutes it was totally consumed.\r\n\r\nOxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, so prepared as to exclude\r\nall floating particles, produce, when poured or blown into the beam,\r\nthe darkness of stellar space.  Coal-gas does the same.  An ordinary\r\nglass shade, placed in the air with its mouth downwards, permits the\r\ntrack of the beam to be seen crossing it.  When coal-gas or hydrogen\r\nis allowed to enter the shade by a tube reaching to its top, the gas\r\ngradually fills the shade from above downwards.  As soon as it\r\noccupies the space crossed by the beam, the luminous track is\r\nabolished.  Lifting the shade so as to bring the common boundary of\r\ngas and air above the beam, the track flashes forth.  After the shade\r\nis full, if it be inverted, the pure gas passes upwards like a black\r\nsmoke among the illuminated particles.\r\n\r\nThe Germ Theory of Contagious Disease.\r\n\r\nThere is no respite to our contact with the floating matter of the\r\nair; and the wonder is, not that we should suffer occasionally from\r\nits presence, but that so small a portion of it, and even that but\r\nrarely diffused over large areas, should appear to be deadly to man.\r\nAnd what is this portion?  It was some time ago the current belief\r\nthat epidemic diseases generally were propagated by a kind of malaria,\r\nwhich consisted of organic matter in a state of motor-decay; that when\r\nsuch matter was taken into the body through the lungs, skin, or\r\nstomach, it had the power of spreading there the destroying process by\r\nwhich itself had been assailed.  Such a power was visibly exerted in\r\nthe case of yeast. A little leaven was seen to leaven the whole\r\nlump--a mere speck of matter, in this supposed state of decomposition,\r\nbeing apparently competent to propagate indefinitely its own decay.\r\nWhy should not a bit of rotten malaria act in a similar manner within\r\nthe human frame?  In 1836 a very wonderful reply was given to this\r\nquestion.  In that year Cagniard de la Tour discovered the\r\nyeast-plant--a living organism, which when placed in a proper medium\r\nfeeds, grows, and reproduces itself, and in this way carries on the\r\nprocess which we name fermentation.  By this striking discovery\r\nfermentation was connected with organic growth.\r\n\r\nSchwann, of Berlin, discovered the yeast-plant independently about the\r\nsame time; and in February, 1837, he also announced the important\r\nresult, that when a decoction of meat is effectually screened from\r\nordinary air, and supplied solely with calcined air, putrefaction\r\nnever sets in.  Putrefaction, therefore, he affirmed to be caused, not\r\nby the air, but by something which could be destroyed by a\r\nsufficiently high temperature.  The results of Schwann were confirmed\r\nby the independent experiments of Helmholtz, Ure, and Pasteur, while\r\nother methods, pursued by Schultze, and by Schroeder and Dusch, led to\r\nthe same result.\r\n\r\nBut as regards fermentation, the minds of chemists, influenced\r\nprobably by the great authority of Gay-Lussac, fell back upon the old\r\nnotion of matter in a state of decay.  It was not the living\r\nyeast-plant, but the dead or dying parts of it, which, assailed by\r\noxygen, produced the fermentation.  Pasteur, however, proved the real\r\n'ferments,' mediate or immediate, to be organised beings which find in\r\nthe reputed ferments their necessary food.\r\n\r\nSide by side with these researches and discoveries, and fortified by\r\nthem and others, has run the germ theory of epidemic disease.  The\r\nnotion was expressed by Kircher, and favoured by Linnaeus, that\r\nepidemic diseases may be due to germs which float in the atmosphere,\r\nenter the body, and produce disturbance by the development within the\r\nbody of parasitic life.  The strength of this theory consists in the\r\nperfect parallelism of the phenomena of contagious disease with those\r\nof life.  As a planted acorn gives birth to an oak, competent to\r\nproduce a whole crop of acorns, each gifted with the power of\r\nreproducing its parent tree; and as thus from a single seedling a\r\nwhole forest may spring; so, it is contended, these epidemic diseases\r\nliterally plant their seeds, grow, and shake abroad new germs, which,\r\nmeeting in the human body their proper food and temperature, finally\r\ntake possession of whole populations.  There is nothing to my\r\nknowledge in pure chemistry which resembles the power of propagation\r\nand self-multiplication possessed by the matter which produces\r\nepidemic disease.  If you sow wheat you do not get barley; if you sow\r\nsmall-pox you do not get scarlet-fever, but small-pox indefinitely\r\nmultiplied, and nothing else.  The matter of each contagious disease\r\nreproduces itself as rigidly as if it were (as Miss Nightingale puts\r\nit) dog or cat.\r\n\r\nParasitic Diseases of Silkworms.  Pasteur's Researches.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted on all hands that some diseases are the product of\r\nparasitic growth.  Both in man and in lower creatures, the existence\r\nof such diseases has been demonstrated.  I am enabled to lay before\r\nyou an account of an epidemic of this kind, thoroughly investigated\r\nand successfully combated by M. Pasteur.  For fifteen years a plague\r\nhad raged among the silkworms of France.  They had sickened and died\r\nin multitudes, while those that succeeded in spinning their cocoons\r\nfurnished only a fraction of the normal quantity of silk.  In 1853 the\r\nsilk culture of France produced a revenue of one hundred and thirty\r\nmillions of francs.  During the twenty previous years the revenue had\r\ndoubled itself, and no doubt was entertained as to its further\r\naugmentation.  The weight of the cocoons produced in 1853 was\r\n26,000,000 kilogrammes; in 1865 it had fallen to 4,000,000, the fall\r\nentailing, in a single year, a loss of 100,000,000 francs.\r\n\r\nThe country chiefly smitten by this calamity happened to be that of\r\nthe celebrated chemist Dumas, now perpetual secretary of the French\r\nAcademy of Sciences.  He turned to his friend, colleague, and pupil,\r\nPasteur, and besought him, with an earnestness which the circumstances\r\nrendered almost personal, to undertake the investigation of the\r\nmalady.  Pasteur at this time had never seen a silkworm, and he urged\r\nhis inexperience in reply to his friend.  But Dumas knew too well the\r\nqualities needed for such an enquiry to accept Pasteur's reason for\r\ndeclining it.  'Je mets,' said he, 'un prix extréme à voir votre\r\nattention fixée sur la question qui intéresse mon pauvre pays; la\r\nmisére surpasse tout ce que vous pouvez imaginer.' Pamphlets about the\r\nplague had been showered upon the public, the monotony of waste paper\r\nbeing broken, at rare intervals, by a more or less useful publication.\r\n'The Pharmacopoeia of the Silkworm,' wrote M. Cornalia in 1860, 'is\r\nnow as complicated as that of man.  Gases, liquids, and solids have\r\nbeen laid under contribution.  From chlorine to sulphurous acid, from\r\nnitric acid to rum, from sugar to sulphate of quinine,--all has been\r\ninvoked in behalf of this unhappy insect.' The helpless cultivators,\r\nmoreover, welcomed with ready trustfulness every new remedy, if only\r\npressed upon them with sufficient hardihood. It seemed impossible to\r\ndiminish their blind confidence in their blind guides.  In 1863 the\r\nFrench Minister of Agriculture signed an agreement to pay 500,000\r\nfrancs for the use of a remedy, which its promoter declared to be\r\ninfallible.  It was tried in twelve different departments of France,\r\nand found perfectly useless.  In no single instance was it successful.\r\nIt was under these circumstances that M. Pasteur, yielding to the\r\nentreaties of his friend, betook himself to Alais in the beginning of\r\nJune, 1865.  As regards silk husbandry, this was the most important\r\ndepartment in France, and it was the most sorely smitten by the\r\nplague.\r\n\r\nThe silkworm had been previously attacked by muscardine, a disease\r\nproved by Bassi to be caused by a vegetable parasite.  This malady was\r\npropagated annually by the parasitic spores.  Wafted by winds they\r\noften sowed the disease in places far removed from the centre of\r\ninfection.  Muscardine is now said to be very rare, a deadlier malady\r\nhaving taken its place.  This new disease is characterised by the\r\nblack spots which cover the silkworms; hence the name _pébrine_, first\r\napplied to the plague by M. de Quatrefages, and adopted by Pasteur.\r\n_pébrine_ declares itself in the stunted and unequal growth of the\r\nworms, in the languor of their movements, in their fastidiousness as\r\nregards food, and in their premature death.  The course of discovery\r\nas regards the epidemic is this: In 1849 Guérin Méneville noticed in\r\nthe blood of silkworms vibratory corpuscles, which he supposed from\r\ntheir motions to be endowed with independent life.  Filippi, however,\r\nshowed that the motion of the corpuscles was the well-known Brownian\r\nmotion; but he committed the error of supposing the corpuscles to be\r\nnormal to the life of the insect.  Possessing the power of indefinite\r\nself-multiplication, they are really the cause of its mortality--the\r\nform and substance of its disease.  This was well described by\r\nCornalia; while Lebert and Frey subsequently found the corpuscles not\r\nonly in the blood, but in all the tissues of the insect.  Osimo, in\r\n1857, discovered them in the eggs; and on this observation Vittadiani\r\nfounded, in 1859, a practical method of distinguishing healthy from\r\ndiseased eggs.  The test often proved fallacious, and it was never\r\nextensively applied.\r\n\r\nThese living corpuscles take possession of the intestinal canal, and\r\nspread thence throughout the body of the worm.  They fill the silk\r\ncavities, the stricken insect often going automatically through the\r\nmotions of spinning, without any material to work upon.  Its organs,\r\ninstead of being filled with the clear viscous liquid of the silk, are\r\npacked to distension by the corpuscles.  On this feature of the plague\r\nPasteur fixed his entire attention.  The cycle of the silkworm's life\r\nis briefly this: From the fertile egg comes the little worm, which\r\ngrows, and casts its skin.  This process of moulting is repeated two\r\nor three times at intervals during the life of the insect.  After the\r\nlast moulting the worm climbs the brambles placed to receive it, and\r\nspins among them its cocoon.  It passes thus into a chrysalis; the\r\nchrysalis becomes a moth, and the moth, when liberated, lays the eggs\r\nwhich form the starting-point of a new cycle.  Now Pasteur proved that\r\nthe plague-corpuscles might be incipient in the egg, and escape\r\ndetection; they might also be germinal in the worm, and still baffle\r\nthe microscope.  But as the worm grows, the corpuscles grow also,\r\nbecoming larger and more defined.  In the aged chrysalis they are more\r\npronounced than in the worm; while in the moth, if either the egg or\r\nthe worm from which it comes should have been at all stricken, the\r\ncorpuscles infallibly appear, offering no difficulty of detection.\r\nThis was the first great point made out in 1865 by Pasteur.  The\r\nItalian naturalists, as aforesaid, recommended the examination of the\r\neggs before risking their incubation.  Pasteur showed that both eggs\r\nand worms might be smitten, and still pass muster, the culture of such\r\neggs or such worms being sure to entail disaster.  He made the moth\r\nhis starting-point in seeking to regenerate the race.\r\n\r\nPasteur made his first communication on this subject to the Academy of\r\nSciences in September, 1865.  It raised a cloud of criticism.  Here,\r\nforsooth, was a chemist rashly quitting his proper _métier_ and\r\npresuming to lay down the law for the physician and biologist on a\r\nsubject which was eminently theirs.  'On trouva étrange que je fusse\r\nsi peu au courant de la question; on m'opposa des travaux qui avaient\r\nparu depuis longtemps en Italie, dont les résultats montraient\r\nl'inutilité de mes efforts, et l'impossibilité d'arriver à un résultat\r\npratique dans la direction que je m'étais engagé.  Que mon ignorance\r\nfut grande au sujet des recherches sans nombre qui avaient paru depuis\r\nquinze années.' Pasteur heard the buzz, but he continued his work.  In\r\nchoosing the eggs intended for incubation, the cultivators selected\r\nthose produced in the successful 'educations' of the year.  But they\r\ncould not understand the frequent and often disastrous failures of\r\ntheir selected eggs; for they did not know, and nobody prior to\r\nPasteur was competent to tell them, that the finest cocoons may\r\nenvelope doomed corpusculous moths.  It was not, however, easy to make\r\nthe cultivators accept new guidance.  To strike their imagination, and\r\nif possible determine their practice, Pasteur hit upon the expedient\r\nof prophecy.  In 1866 he inspected, at St. Hippolyte-du-Fort, fourteen\r\ndifferent parcels of eggs intended for incubation.  Having examined a\r\nsufficient number of the moths which produced these eggs, he wrote out\r\nthe prediction of what would occur in 1867, and placed the prophecy as\r\na sealed letter in the hands of the Mayor of St. Hippolyte.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the cultivators communicated to the mayor their results.  The\r\nletter of Pasteur was then opened and read, and it was found that in\r\ntwelve out of fourteen cases there was absolute conformity between his\r\nprediction and the observed facts.  Many of the groups had perished\r\ntotally; the others had perished almost totally; and this was the\r\nprediction of Pasteur.  In two out of the fourteen cases, instead of\r\nthe prophesied destruction, half an average crop was obtained.  Now,\r\nthe parcels of eggs here referred to were considered healthy by their\r\nowners.  They had been hatched and tended in the firm hope that the\r\nlabour expended on them would prove remunerative.  The application of\r\nthe moth-test for a few minutes in 1866, would have saved the labour\r\nand averted the disappointment.  Two additional parcels of eggs were\r\nat the same time submitted to Pasteur.  He pronounced them healthy;\r\nand his words were verified by the production of an excellent crop.\r\nOther cases of prophecy still more remarkable, because more\r\ncircumstantial, are recorded in Pasteur's work.\r\n\r\nPasteur subjected the development of the corpuscles to a searching\r\ninvestigation, and followed out with admirable skill and completeness\r\nthe various modes by which the plague was propagated. From moths\r\nperfectly free from corpuscles he obtained healthy worms, and\r\nselecting 10, 20, 30, 50, as the case might be, he introduced into the\r\nworms the corpusculous matter. It was first permitted to accompany the\r\nfood. Let its take a single example out of many. Rubbing up a small\r\ncorpusculous worm in water, he smeared the mixture over the\r\nmulberry-leaves. Assuring himself that the leaves had been eaten, he\r\nwatched the consequences from day to day. Side by side with the\r\ninfected worms he reared their fellows, keeping them as much as\r\npossible out of the way of infection. These constituted his 'lot\r\ntémoin,'--his standard of comparison. On April 16, 1868, he thus\r\ninfected thirty worms. Up to the 23rd they remained quite well. On the\r\n25th they seemed well, but on that day corpuscles were found in the\r\nintestines of two of them. On the 27th, or eleven days after the\r\ninfected repast, two fresh worms were examined, and not only was the\r\nintestinal canal found in each case invaded, but the silk organ itself\r\nwas charged with corpuscles. On the 28th the twenty-six remaining\r\nworms were covered by the black spots of _pébrine_. On the 30th the\r\ndifference of size between the infected and non-infected worms was\r\nvery striking, the sick worms being not more than two-thirds of the\r\nbulk of the healthy ones. On May 2 a worm which had just finished its\r\nfourth moulting was examined. Its whole body was so filled with the\r\nparasite as to excite astonishment that it could live.\r\n\r\nThe disease advanced, the worms died and were examined, and on May 11\r\nonly six out of the thirty remained. They were the strongest of the\r\nlot, but on being searched they also were found charged with\r\ncorpuscles. Not one of the thirty worms had escaped; a single meal had\r\npoisoned them all. The standard lot, on the contrary, spun their fine\r\ncocoons, two only of their moths being proved to contain any trace of\r\nthe parasite, which had doubtless been introduced during the rearing\r\nof the worms.\r\n\r\nAs his acquaintance with the subject increased, Pasteur's desire for\r\nprecision augmented, and he finally counted the growing number of\r\ncorpuscles seen in the field of his microscope from day to day. After\r\na contagious repast the number of worms containing the parasite\r\ngradually augmented until finally it became cent. per cent. The number\r\nof corpuscles would at the same time rise from 0 to 1, to 10, to 100,\r\nand sometimes even to 1,000 or 1,500 in the field of his microscope.\r\nHe then varied the mode of infection. He inoculated healthy worms with\r\nthe corpusculous matter, and watched the consequent growth of the\r\ndisease. He proved that the worms inoculate each other by the\r\ninfliction of visible wounds with their claws. In various cases he\r\nwashed the claws, and found corpuscles in the water. He demonstrated\r\nthe spread of infection by the simple association of healthy and\r\ndiseased worms. By their claws and their dejections, the diseased\r\nworms spread infection.  It was no hypothetical infected medium--no\r\nproblematical pythogenic gas--that killed the worms, but a definite\r\norganism. The question of infection at a distance was also examined,\r\nand its existence demonstrated. As might be expected from Pasteur's\r\nantecedents, the investigation was exhaustive, the skill and beauty of\r\nhis manipulation finding fitting correlatives in the strength and\r\nclearness of his thought.\r\n\r\nThe following quotation from Pasteur's work clearly shows the relation\r\nin which his researches stand to the important question on which he\r\nwas engaged:\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPlace (he says) the most skilful educator, even the most expert\r\nmicroscopist, in presence of large educations which present the\r\nsymptoms described in our experiments; his judgment will necessarily\r\nbe erroneous if he confines himself to the knowledge which preceded my\r\nresearches.  The worms will not present to him the slightest spot of\r\n_pébrine_; the microscope will not reveal the existence of corpuscles;\r\nthe mortality of the worms will be null or insignificant; and the\r\ncocoons leave nothing to be desired.  Our observer would, therefore,\r\nconclude without hesitation that the eggs produced will be good for\r\nincubation.  The truth is, on the contrary, that all the worms of\r\nthese fine crops have been poisoned; that from the beginning they\r\ncarried in them the germ of the malady; ready to multiply itself\r\nbeyond measure in the chrysalides and the moths, thence to pass into\r\nthe eggs and smite with sterility the next generation.  And what is\r\nthe first cause of the evil concealed under so deceitful an exterior?\r\nIn our experiments we can, so to speak, touch it with our fingers.  It\r\nis entirely the effect of a single corpusculous repast; an effect more\r\nor less prompt according to the epoch of life of the worm that has\r\neaten the poisoned food.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPasteur describes in detail his method of securing healthy eggs.  It\r\nis nothing less than a mode of restoring to France her ancient silk\r\nhusbandry.  The justification of his work is to be found in the\r\nreports which reached him of the application and the unparalleled\r\nsuccess of his method, while editing his researches for final\r\npublication.  In both France and Italy his method has been pursued\r\nwith the most surprising results.  But it was an up-hill fight which\r\nled to this triumph.\r\n\r\n'Ever,' he says, 'since the commencement of these researches, I have\r\nbeen exposed to the most obstinate and unjust contradictions; but I\r\nhave made it a duty to leave no trace of these conflicts in this\r\nbook.' And in reference to parasitic diseases, generally, he uses the\r\nfollowing weighty words: 'Il est au pouvoir de l'homme de faire\r\ndisparaitre de la surface du globe les maladies parasitaires, si,\r\ncomme c'est ma conviction, la doctrine des générations spontanées est\r\nune chimère.'\r\n\r\nPasteur dwells upon the ease with which an island like Corsica might\r\nbe absolutely isolated from the silkworm epidemic.  And with regard to\r\nother epidemics, Mr. Simon describes an extraordinary case of insular\r\nexemption, for the ten years extending from 1851 to 1860.  Of the 627\r\nregistration districts of England, one only had an entire escape from\r\ndiseases which, in whole or in part, were prevalent in all the others:\r\n'In all the ten years it had not a single death by measles, nor a\r\nsingle death by small-pox, nor a single death by scarlet-fever.  And\r\nwhy?  Not because of its general sanitary merits, for it had an\r\naverage amounts of other evidence of unhealthiness.  Doubtless, the\r\nreason of its escape was that it was insular.  It was the district of\r\nthe Scilly Isles; to which it was most improbable that any febrile\r\ncontagion should come from without.  And its escape is an\r\napproximative proof that, at least for those ten years, no _contagium_\r\nof measles, nor any _contagium_ of scarlet-fever, nor any _contagium_ of\r\nsmallpox had arisen spontaneously within its limits.' It may be added\r\nthat there were only seven districts in England in which no death from\r\ndiphtheria occurred, and that, of those seven districts, the district\r\nof the Scilly Isles was one.\r\n\r\nA second parasitic disease of silkworms, called in France _la\r\nFlacherie_, co-existent with _pébrine_, but quite distinct from it, has\r\nalso been investigated by Pasteur.  Enough, however, has been said to\r\nsend the reader interested in these questions to the original volumes\r\nfor further information.  To one important practical point M. Pasteur,\r\nin a letter to myself, directs attention:\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPermettez-moi de terminer ces quelques lignes que je dois dicter,\r\nvaincu que je suis par la maladie, en vous faisant observer que vous\r\nrendriez service aux Colonies de la Grande-Bretagne en répandant la\r\nconnaissance de ce livre, et des principes que j'établis touchant la\r\nmaladie des vers à soie.  Beaucoup de ces colonies pourraient cultiver\r\nle mûrier avec succés, et, en jetant les yeux sur mon ouvrage, vous\r\nvous convaincrez aisement qu'il est facile aujourd'hui, nonseulement\r\nd'éloigner la maladie régnante, mais en outre de donner aux récoltes\r\nde la soie une prospérité qu'elles n'ont jamais eue.\r\n\r\nOrigin and Propagation of Contagious Matter.\r\n\r\nPrior to Pasteur, the most diverse and contradictory opinions were\r\nentertained as to the contagious character of _pébrine_; some stoutly\r\naffirmed it, others as stoutly denied it.  But on one point all were\r\nagreed.  I They believed in the existence of a deleterious medium,\r\nrendered epidemic by some occult and mysterious influence, to which\r\nwas attributed the cause of the disease.' Those acquainted with our\r\nmedical literature will not fail to observe an instructive analogy\r\nhere.  We have on the one side accomplished writers ascribing epidemic\r\ndiseases to 'deleterious media' which arise spontaneously in crowded\r\nhospitals and ill-smelling drains.  According to them, the _contagia_ of\r\nepidemic disease are formed _de novo_ in a putrescent atmosphere.  On\r\nthe other side we have writers, clear, vigorous, with well-defined\r\nideas and methods of research, contending that the matter which\r\nproduces epidemic disease comes always from a parent stock.  It\r\nbehaves as germinal matter, and they do not hesitate to regard it as\r\nsuch.  They no more believe in the spontaneous generation of such\r\ndiseases, than they do in the spontaneous generation of mice. Pasteur,\r\nfor example, found that _pébrine_ had been known for an indefinite time\r\nas a disease among silkworms.  The development of it which he combated\r\nwas merely the expansion of an already existing power--the bursting\r\ninto open conflagration of a previously smouldering fire.  There is\r\nnothing surprising in this.  For though epidemic disease requires a\r\nspecial _contagium_ to produce it, surrounding conditions must have a\r\npotent influence on its development.  Common seeds may be duly sown,\r\nbut the conditions of temperature and moisture may be such as to\r\nrestrict, or altogether prevent, the subsequent growth.  Looked at,\r\ntherefore, from the point of view of the germ theory, the exceptional\r\nenergy which epidemic disease from time to time exhibits, is in\r\nharmony with the method of Nature.  We sometimes hear diphtheria\r\nspoken of as if it were a new disease of the last twenty years; but\r\nMr. Simon tells me that about three centuries ago tremendous epidemics\r\nof it began to rage in Spain (where it was named _Garrotillo_), and soon\r\nafterwards in Italy; and that since that time the disease has been\r\nwell known to all successive generations of doctors.  In or about\r\n1758, for instance, Dr. Starr, of Liskeard, in a communication to the\r\nRoyal Society, particularly described the disease, with all the\r\ncharacters which have recently again become familiar, but under the\r\nname of _morbus strangulatorius_, as then severely epidemic in Cornwall.\r\nThis fact is the more interesting, as diphtheria, in its more modern\r\nreappearance, again showed predilection for that remote county.  Many\r\nalso believe that the Black Death, of five centuries ago, has\r\ndisappeared as mysteriously as it came; but Mr. Simon finds that it is\r\nbelieved to be prevalent at this hour in some of the north-western\r\nparts of India.\r\n\r\nLet me here state an item of my own experience.  When I was at the Bel\r\nAlp in 1869, the English chaplain received letters informing him of\r\nthe breaking out of scarlet-fever among his children.  He lived, if I\r\nremember rightly, on the healthful eminence of Dartmoor, and it was\r\ndifficult to imagine how scarlet-fever could have been wafted to the\r\nplace.  A drain ran close to his house, and on it his suspicions were\r\nmanifestly fixed.  Some of our medical writers would fortify him in\r\nthis notion, and thus deflect him from the truth, while those of\r\nanother, and, in my opinion, a wiser school, would deny to a drain,\r\nhowever foul, the power of generating _de novo_ a specific disease.\r\nAfter close enquiry he recollected that a hobby-horse had been used\r\nboth by his boy and another, who, a short time previously, had passed\r\nthrough scarlet-fever.\r\n\r\nDrains and cesspools, indeed, are by no means in such evil odour as\r\nthey used to be.  A fetid Thames and a low death-rate occur from time\r\nto time together in London.  For, if the special matter or germs of\r\nepidemic disorder be not present, a corrupt atmosphere, however\r\nobnoxious otherwise, will not produce the disorder.  But, if the germs\r\nbe present, defective drains and cesspools become the potent\r\ndistributors of disease and death.  Corrupted air may promote an\r\nepidemic, but cannot produce it.  On the other hand, through the\r\ntransport of the special germ or virus, disease may develop itself in\r\nregions where the drainage is good and the atmosphere pure.\r\n\r\nIf you see a new thistle growing in your field, you feel sure that its\r\nseed has been wafted thither.  Just as sure does it seem that the\r\ncontagious matter of epidemic disease has been transplanted to the\r\nplace where it newly appears.  With a clearness and conclusiveness s\r\nnot to be surpassed, Dr. William Budd has traced such diseases from\r\nplace to place; showing how they plant themselves, at distinct foci,\r\namong populations subjected to the same atmospheric influences, just\r\nas grains of corn might be carried in the pocket and sown. Hildebrand,\r\nto whose remarkable work, 'Du Typhus contagieux,' Dr. de Mussy has\r\ndirected my attention, gives the following striking case, both of the\r\ndurability and the transport of the virus of scarlatina: 'Un habit\r\nnoir que j'avais en visitant une malade attaquée de scarlatina, et que\r\nje portai de Vienne en Podolie, sans l'avoir mis depuis plus d'un an\r\net demi, me communiqua, dès que je fus arrivé, cette maladie\r\ncontagieuse, que je répandis ensuite dans cette province, où elle\r\nétait jusqu'alors presque inconnue.' Some years ago Dr. de Mussy\r\nhimself was summoned to a country house in Surrey, to see a young lady\r\nwho was suffering from a dropsy, evidently the consequence of\r\nscarlatina.  The original disease, being of a very mild character, had\r\nbeen quite overlooked; but circumstances were recorded which could\r\nleave no doubt upon the mind as to the nature and cause of the\r\ncomplaint.  But then the question arose, How did the young lady catch\r\nthe scarlatina?  She had come there on a visit two months previously,\r\nand it was only after she had been a month in the house that she was\r\ntaken ill.  The housekeeper at length cleared up the mystery.  The\r\nyoung lady, on her arrival, had expressed a wish to occupy a room in\r\nan isolated tower.  Her desire was granted; and in that room, six\r\nmonths previously, a visitor had been confined with an attack of\r\nscarlatina.  The room had been swept and whitewashed, but the carpets\r\nhad been permitted to remain.\r\n\r\nThousands of cases could probably be cited in which the disease has\r\nshown itself in this mysterious way, but where a strict examination\r\nhas revealed its true parentage and extraction.  Is it, then,\r\nphilosophical to take refuge in the fortuitous concourse of atoms as a\r\ncause of specific disease, merely because in special cases the\r\nparentage may be indistinct?  Those best acquainted with atomic\r\nnature, and who are most ready to admit, as regards even higher things\r\nthan this, the potentialities of matter, will be the last to accept\r\nthese rash hypotheses.\r\n\r\nThe Germ Theory applied to Surgery.\r\n\r\nNot only medical but still more especially surgical science is now\r\nseeking light and guidance from this germ theory.  Upon it the\r\nantiseptic system of Professor Lister of Edinburgh is founded.  As\r\nalready stated, the germ theory of putrefaction was started by\r\nSchwann; but the illustrations of this theory adduced by Professor\r\nLister are of such public moment as not only to justify, but to render\r\nimperative, their introduction here.\r\n\r\nSchwann's observations (says Professor Lister) did not receive the\r\nattention which they appeared to me to have deserved.  The\r\nfermentation of sugar was generally allowed to be occasioned by the\r\n_Torula cerevisiae_; but it was not admitted that putrefaction was due\r\nto an analogous agency.  And yet the two cases present a very striking\r\nparallel.  In each a stable chemical compound, sugar in the one case,\r\nalbumen in the other, undergoes extraordinary chemical changes under\r\nthe influence of an excessively minute quantity of a substance which,\r\nregarded chemically, we should suppose inert.  As an example of this\r\nin the case of putrefaction, let us take a circumstance often\r\nwitnessed in the treatment of large chronic abscesses.  In order to\r\nguard against the access of atmospheric air, we used to draw off the\r\nmatter by means of a canula and trocar, such as you see here,\r\nconsisting of a silver tube with a sharp-pointed steel rod fitted into\r\nit, and projecting beyond it.  The instrument, dipped in oil, was\r\nthrust into the cavity of the abscess, the trocar was withdrawn, and\r\nthe pus flowed out through the canula, care being taken by gentle\r\npressure over the part to prevent the possibility of regurgitation.\r\nThe canula was then drawn out with due precaution against the reflux\r\nof air.  This method was frequently successful as to its immediate\r\nobject, the patient being relieved from the mass of the accumulated\r\nfluid, and experiencing no inconvenience from the operation.  But the\r\npus was pretty certain to reaccumulate in course of time, and it\r\nbecame necessary again and again to repeat the process.  And unhappily\r\nthere was no absolute security of immunity from bad consequences.\r\nHowever carefully the procedure was conducted, it sometimes happened,\r\neven though the puncture seemed healing by first intention, that\r\nfeverish symptoms declared themselves in the course of the first or\r\nsecond day, and, on inspecting the seat of the abscess, the skin was\r\nperhaps seen to be red, implying the presence of some cause of\r\nirritation, while a rapid reaccumulation of the fluid was found to\r\nhave occurred.  Under these circumstances, it became necessary to open\r\nthe abscess by free incision, when a quantity, large in proportion to\r\nthe size of the abscess, say, for example, a quart, of pus escaped,\r\nfetid from putrefaction.  Now, how had this change been brought about?\r\nWithout the germ theory, I venture to say, no rational explanation of\r\nit could have been given.  It must have been caused by the\r\nintroduction of something from without.  Inflammation of the punctured\r\nwound, even supposing it to have occurred, would not explain the\r\nphenomenon.  For mere inflammation, whether acute or chronic, though\r\nit occasions the formation of pus, does not induce Putrefaction.  The\r\npus originally evacuated was perfectly sweet, and we know of nothing\r\nto account for the alteration in its quality but the influence of\r\nsomething derived from the external world.  And what could that\r\nsomething be?  The dipping of the instrument in oil, and the\r\nsubsequent precautions, prevented the entrance of oxygen.  Or even if\r\nyou allowed that a few atoms of the gas did enter, it would be an\r\nextraordinary assumption to make that these could in so short a time\r\neffect such changes in so large a mass of albuminous material.\r\nBesides, the pyogenic membrane is abundantly supplied with capillary\r\nvessels, through which arterial blood, rich in oxygen, is perpetually\r\nflowing; and there can be little doubt that the pus, before it was\r\nevacuated at all, was liable to any action which the element might be\r\ndisposed to exert upon it.\r\n\r\nOn the oxygen theory, then, the occurrence of putrefaction under these\r\ncircumstances is quite inexplicable.  But if you admit the germ\r\ntheory, the difficulty vanishes at once.  The canula and trocar having\r\nbeen lying exposed to the air, dust will have been deposited upon\r\nthem, and will be present in the angle between the trocar and the\r\nsilver tube, and in that protected situation will fail to be wiped off\r\nwhen the instrument is thrust through the tissues.  Then when the\r\ntrocar is withdrawn, some portions of this dust will naturally remain\r\nupon the margin of the canula, which is left projecting into the\r\nabscess, and nothing is more likely than that some particles may fail\r\nto be washed off by the stream of out-flowing pus, but may be\r\ndislodged when the tube is taken out, and left behind in the cavity.\r\nThe germ theory tells us that these particles of dust will be pretty\r\nsure to contain the germs of putrefactive organisms, and if one such\r\nis left in the albuminous liquid, it will rapidly develop at the high\r\ntemperature of the body, and account for all the phenomena.\r\n\r\nBut striking as is the parallel between putrefaction in this instance\r\nand the vinous fermentation, as regards the greatness of the effect\r\nproduced, compared with the minuteness and the inertness, chemically\r\nspeaking, of the cause, you will naturally desire further evidence of\r\nthe similarity of the two processes.  You can see with the microscope\r\nthe Torula of fermenting must or beer.  Is there, you may ask, any\r\norganism to be detected in the putrefying pus?  Yes, gentlemen, there\r\nis.  If any drop of the putrid matter is examined with a good glass,\r\nit is found to be teeming with myriads of minute jointed bodies,\r\ncalled vibrios, which indubitably proclaim their vitality by the\r\nenergy of their movements.  It is not an affair of probability, but a\r\nfact, that the entire mass of that quart of pus has become peopled\r\nwith living organisms as the result of the introduction of the canula\r\nand trocar; for the matter first let out was as free from vibrios as\r\nit was from putrefaction.  If this be so, the greatness of the\r\nchemical changes that have taken place in the pus ceases to be\r\nsurprising.  We know that it is one of the chief peculiarities of\r\nliving structures that they possess extraordinary powers of effecting\r\nchemical changes in materials in their vicinity, out of all proportion\r\nto their energy as mere chemical compounds.  And we can hardly doubt\r\nthat the animalcules which have been developed in the albuminous\r\nliquid, and have grown at its expense, must have altered its\r\nconstitution, just as we ourselves alter that of the materials on\r\nwhich we feed. [Footnote: 'Introductory Lecture before the University\r\nof Edinburgh.']\r\n\r\nIn the operations of Professor Lister care is taken that every portion\r\nof tissue laid bare by the knife shall be defended from germs; that if\r\nthey fall upon the wound they should be killed as they fall.  With\r\nthis in view he showers upon his exposed surfaces the spray of dilute\r\ncarbolic acid, which is particularly deadly to the germs, and he\r\nsurrounds the wound in the most careful manner with antiseptic\r\nbandages.  To those accustomed to strict experiment it is manifest\r\nthat we have a strict experimenter here--a man with a perfectly\r\ndistinct object in view, which he pursues with never-tiring patience\r\nand unwavering faith.  And the result, in his hospital practice, as\r\ndescribed by himself, has been, that even in the midst of abominations\r\ntoo shocking to be mentioned here, and in the neighbourhood of wards\r\nwhere death was rampant from pyaemia, erysipelas, and hospital\r\ngangrene, he was able to keep his patients absolutely free from these\r\nterrible scourges.  Let me here recommend to your attention Professor\r\nLister's 'Introductory Lecture before the University of Edinburgh,'\r\nwhich I have already quoted; his paper on The Effect of the Antiseptic\r\nSystem of Treatment on the Salubrity of a Surgical Hospital;' and the\r\narticle in the 'British Medical Journal' of January 14, 1871.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of using carbolic acid spray, he could surround his wounds\r\nwith properly filtered air, the result would, he contends, be the\r\nsame.  In a room where the germs not only float but cling to clothes\r\nand walls, this would be difficult, if not impossible.  But surgery is\r\nacquainted with a class of wounds in which the blood is freely mixed\r\nwith air that has passed through the lungs, and it is a most\r\nremarkable fact that such air does not produce putrefaction. Professor\r\nLister, as far as I know, was the first to give a philosophical\r\ninterpretation of this fact, which he describes and comments upon\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nI have explained to my own mind the remarkable fact that in simple\r\nfracture of the ribs, if the lung be punctured by a fragment, the\r\nblood effused into the pleural cavity, though freely mixed with air,\r\nundergoes no decomposition.  The air is sometimes pumped into the\r\npleural cavity in such abundance that, making its way through the\r\nwound in the pleura costalis, it inflates the cellular tissue of the\r\nwhole body.  Yet this occasions no alarm to the surgeon (although if\r\nthe blood in the pleura were to putrefy, it would infallibly occasion\r\ndangerous suppurative pleurisy).  Why air introduced into the pleural\r\ncavity through a wounded lung, should have such wholly different\r\neffects from that entering directly through a wound in the chest, was\r\nto me a complete mystery until I heard of the germ theory of\r\nputrefaction, when it at once occurred to me that it was only natural\r\nthat air should be filtered of germs by the air-passages, one of whose\r\noffices is to arrest inhaled particles of dust, and prevent them from\r\nentering the air-cells.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI shall have occasion to refer to this remarkable hypothesis farther\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the germ theory, both of putrefaction and epidemic\r\ndisease, hold that both arise, not from the air, but from something\r\ncontained in the air.  They hold, moreover, that this 'something' is\r\nnot a vapour nor a gas, nor indeed a molecule of any kind, but a\r\n_particle_. [Footnote: As regards size, there is probably no sharp line\r\nof division between molecules and particles; the one gradually shades\r\ninto the other.  But the distinction that I would draw is this: the\r\natom or the molecule, if free, is always part of a gas, the particle\r\nis never so.  A particle is a bit of liquid or solid matter, formed by\r\nthe Aggregation of atoms or molecules.]  The term 'particulate 'has\r\nbeen used in the Reports of the Medical Department of the Privy\r\nCouncil to describe this supposed constitution of contagious matter;\r\nand Dr. Sanderson's experiments render it in the highest degree\r\nprobable, if they do not actually demonstrate, that the virus of\r\nsmall-pox is 'particulate.' Definite knowledge upon this point is of\r\nexceeding importance, because in the treatment of _particles_ methods\r\nare available which it would be futile to apply to _molecules_.\r\n\r\nThe Luminous beam as a means of Research.\r\n\r\nMy own interference with this great question, while sanctioned by\r\neminent names, has been also an object of varied and ingenious attack.\r\nOn this point I will only say that when angry feeling escapes from\r\nbehind the intellect, where it may be useful as an urging force, and\r\nplaces itself athwart the intellect, it is liable to produce all\r\nmanner of delusions.  Thus my censors, for the most part, have\r\nlevelled their remarks against positions which were never assumed, and\r\nagainst claims which were never made.  The simple history of the\r\nmatter is this: During the autumn of 1868 I was much occupied with the\r\nobservations referred to at the beginning of this discourse, and in\r\npart described in the preceding article.  For fifteen years it had\r\nbeen my habit to make use of floating dust to reveal the paths of\r\nluminous beams through the air; but until 1868 I did not intentionally\r\nreverse the process, and employ a luminous beam to reveal and examine\r\nthe dust. In a paper presented to the Royal Society in December, 1869,\r\nthe observations which induced me to give more special attention to\r\nthe question of spontaneous generation, and the germ theory of\r\nepidemic disease, are thus described:\r\n\r\nThe Floating Matter of the Air.\r\n\r\nPrior to the discovery of the foregoing action (the chemical action of\r\nlight upon vapours, Fragment IV.), and also during the experiments\r\njust referred to, the nature of my work compelled me to aim at\r\nobtaining experimental tubes absolutely clean upon the surface, and\r\nabsolutely free within from suspended matter.  Neither condition is,\r\nhowever, easily attained.\r\n\r\nFor however well the tubes might be washed and polished, and however\r\nbright and pure they might appear in ordinary daylight, the electric\r\nbeam infallibly revealed signs and tokens of dirt.  The air was always\r\npresent, and it was sure to deposit some impurity.  All chemical\r\nprocesses, not conducted in a vacuum, are open to this disturbance.\r\nWhen the experimental tube was exhausted, it exhibited no trace of\r\nfloating matter, but on admitting the air through the U-tubes\r\n(containing caustic potash and sulphuric acid), a _dust-cone_ more or\r\nless distinct was always revealed by the powerfully condensed electric\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nThe floating motes resembled minute particles of liquid which had been\r\ncarried mechanically from the U-tubes into the experimental tube.\r\nPrecautions were therefore taken to prevent any such transfer.  They\r\nproduced little or no mitigation.  I did not imagine, at the time,\r\nthat the dust of the external air could find such free passage through\r\nthe caustic potash and sulphuric acid.  This, however, was the case;\r\nthe motes really came from without.  They also passed with freedom\r\nthrough a variety of aethers and alcohols.  In fact, it requires\r\nlong-continued action on the part of an acid first to wet the motes\r\nand afterwards to destroy them.  By carefully passing the air through\r\nthe flame of a spirit lamp, or through a platinum tube heated to\r\nbright redness, the floating matter was sensibly destroyed.  It was\r\ntherefore combustible, in other words, organic, matter.  I tried to\r\nintercept it by a large respirator of cotton-wool.  Close pressure was\r\nnecessary to render the wool effective.  A plug of the wool, rammed\r\npretty tightly into the tube through which the air passed, was finally\r\nfound competent to hold back the motes.  They appeared from time to\r\ntime afterwards, and gave me much trouble; but they were invariably\r\ntraced in the end to some defect in the purifying apparatus--to some\r\ncrack or flaw in the sealing-wax employed to render the tubes\r\nair-tight.  Thus through proper care, but not without a great deal of\r\nsearching out of disturbances, the experimental tube, even when filled\r\nwith air or vapour, contains nothing competent to scatter the light.\r\nThe space within it has the aspect of an absolute vacuum.\r\n\r\nAn experimental tube in this condition I call _optically empty_.\r\n\r\nThe simple apparatus employed in these experiments will be at once\r\nunderstood by reference to a figure printed in the last article (Fig.\r\n3.)  s s' is the glass experimental tube, which has varied in length\r\nfrom 1 to 5 feet, and which may be from 2 to 3 inches in diameter.\r\nFrom the end s, the pipe pp' passes to an air-pump.  Connected with\r\nthe other end s' we have the flask F, containing the liquid whose\r\nvapour is to be examined; then follows a U-tube, T, filled with\r\nfragments of clean glass, wetted with sulphuric acid; then a second\r\nU-tube, T, containing fragments of marble, wetted with caustic potash;\r\nand finally a narrow straight tube t t', containing a tolerably\r\ntightly fitting plug of cotton-wool.  To save the air-pump gauge from\r\nthe attack of such vapours as act on mercury, as also to facilitate\r\nobservation, a separate barometer tube was employed.\r\n\r\nThrough the cork which stops the flask F two glass tubes, a and b,\r\npass air-tight.  The tube a ends immediately under the cork; the tube\r\nb, on the contrary, descends to the bottom of the flask and dips into\r\nthe liquid.  The end of the tube b is drawn out so as to render very\r\nsmall the orifice through which the air escapes into the liquid.\r\n\r\nThe experimental tube s s' being exhausted, a cock at the end s' is\r\nturned carefully on.  The air passes slowly through the cotton-wool,\r\nthe caustic potash, and the sulphuric acid in succession.  Thus\r\npurified, it enters the flask F and bubbles through the liquid.\r\nCharged with vapour, it finally passes into the experimental tube,\r\nwhere it is submitted to examination.  The electric lamp L placed at\r\nthe end of the experimental tube furnishes the necessary beam.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe facts here forced upon my attention had a bearing too evident to\r\nbe overlooked.  The inability of air which had been filtered through\r\ncotton-wool to generate animalcular life, had been demonstrated by\r\nSchroeder and Pasteur: here the cause of its impotence was rendered\r\nevident to the eye.  The experiment proved that no sensible amount of\r\nlight was scattered by the molecules of the air; that the scattered\r\nlight always arose from suspended particles; and the fact that the\r\nremoval of these abolished simultaneously the power of scattering\r\nlight and of originating life, obviously detached the life-originating\r\npower from the air, and fixed it on something suspended in the air.\r\nGases of all kinds passed with freedom through the plug of\r\ncotton-wool; hence the thing whose removal by the cotton-wool rendered\r\nthe gas impotent, could not itself have been matter in the gaseous\r\ncondition.  It at once occurred to me that the retina, protected as it\r\nwas, in these experiments, from all extraneous light, might be\r\nconverted into a new and powerful instrument of demonstration in\r\nrelation to the germ theory.\r\n\r\nBut the observations also revealed the danger incurred in experiments\r\nof this nature; showing that without an amount of care far beyond that\r\nhitherto bestowed upon them, such experiments left the door open to\r\nerrors of the gravest description.  It was especially manifest that\r\nthe chemical method employed by Schultze in his experiments, and so\r\noften resorted to since, might lead to the most erroneous\r\nconsequences; that neither acids nor alkalies had the power of rapid\r\ndestruction hitherto ascribed to them.  In short, the employment of\r\nthe luminous beam rendered evident the cause of success in experiments\r\nrigidly conducted like those of Pasteur; while it made equally evident\r\nthe certainty of failure in experiments less severely carried out.\r\n\r\nDr. Bennett's Experiments.\r\n\r\nBut I do not wish to leave an assertion of this kind without\r\nillustration.  Take, then, the well-conceived experiments of Dr.\r\nHughes Bennett, described before the Royal Society of Surgeons in\r\nEdinburgh on January 17, 1868. [Footnote: 'British Medical Journal,'\r\n13, pt. ii. 1868.]  Into flasks containing decoctions of\r\nliquorice-root, hay, or tea, Dr. Bennett, by an ingenious method,\r\nforced air.  The air was driven through two U-tubes, the one\r\ncontaining a solution of caustic potash, the other sulphuric acid.\r\n'All the bent tubes were filled with fragments of pumice-stone to\r\nbreak up the air, so as to prevent the possibility of any germs\r\npassing through in the centre of bubbles.'  The air also passed\r\nthrough a Liebig's bulb containing sulphuric acid, and also through a\r\nbulb containing gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural for Dr. Bennett to believe that his 'bent tubes'\r\nentirely cut off the germs.  Previous to the observations just\r\nreferred to, I also believed in their efficacy.  But these\r\nobservations destroy any such notion.  The gun-cotton, moreover, will\r\nfail to arrest the whole of the floating matter, unless it is tightly\r\npacked, and there is no indication in Dr. Bennett's memoir that it was\r\nso packed.  On the whole, I should infer, from the mere inspection of\r\nDr. Bennett's apparatus, the very results which he has described--a\r\nretardation of the development of life, a total absence of it in some\r\ncases, and its presence in others.\r\n\r\nIn his first series of experiments, eight flasks were fed with sifted\r\nair, and five with common air.  In ten or twelve days all the five had\r\nfungi in them; whilst it required from four to nine months to develop\r\nfungi in the others.  In one of the eight, moreover, even after this\r\ninterval no fungi appeared.  In a second series of experiments there\r\nwas a similar exception.  In a third series the cork stoppers used in\r\nthe first and second series were abandoned, and glass stoppers\r\nemployed.  Flasks containing decoctions of tea, beef, and hay were\r\nfilled with common air, and other flasks with sifted air.  In every\r\none of the former fungi appeared and in not one of the latter.  These\r\nexperiments simply ruin the doctrine that Dr. Bennett finally\r\nespouses.\r\n\r\nIn all these negative cases, the prepared air was forced into the\r\ninfusion when it was boiling hot.  Dr. Bennett made a fourth series of\r\nexperiments, in which, previous to forcing in the air, he permitted\r\nthe flasks to cool.  Into four bottles thus treated he forced prepared\r\nair, and after a time found fungi in all of them.  What is his\r\nconclusion?  Not that the boiling hot liquid, employed in his first\r\nexperiments, had destroyed such germs as had run the gauntlet of his\r\napparatus; but that air which, previous to being sealed up, had been\r\nexposed to a temperature of 212°, _is too rare to support life_.  This\r\nconclusion is so remarkable that it ought to be stated in Dr.\r\nBennett's own words.  'It may be easily conceived that air subjected\r\nto a boiling temperature is so expanded as scarcely to merit the name\r\nof air, and that it is more or less unfit for the purpose of\r\nsustaining animal or vegetable life.'\r\n\r\nNow numerical data are attainable here, and as a matter of fact I live\r\nand flourish for a considerable portion of each year in a medium of\r\nless density than that which Dr. Bennett describes as scarcely\r\nmeriting the name of air.  The inhabitants of the higher Alpine\r\nchalets, with their flocks and herds, and the grasses which support\r\nthese, do the same; while the chamois rears its kids in air rarer\r\nstill.  Insect life, moreover, is sometimes exhibited with monstrous\r\nprodigality at Alpine heights.\r\n\r\nIn a fifth series of experiments sixteen bottles were filled with\r\ninfusions.  Into four of them, while cold, ordinary unheated and\r\nunsifted air was pumped.  In these four bottles fungi were developed.\r\nInto four other bottles, containing a boiling infusion, ordinary air\r\nwas also pumped--no fungi were here developed.  Into four other\r\nbottles containing an infusion which had been boiled and permitted to\r\ncool, sifted air was pumped--no fungi were developed.  Finally, into\r\nfour bottles containing a boiling infusion sifted air was pumped no\r\nfungi were developed.  Only, therefore, in the four cases where the\r\ninfusions were cold infusions, and the air ordinary air, did fungi\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nDr. Bennett does not draw from his experiments the conclusion to which\r\nthey so obviously point.  On them, on the contrary, he founds a\r\ndefence of the doctrine of spontaneous generation, and a general\r\ntheory of spontaneous development.  So strongly was he impressed with\r\nthe idea that the germs could not possibly pass through his potash and\r\nsulphuric acid tubes, that the appearance of fungi, even in a small\r\nminority of cases, where the air had been sent through these tubes,\r\nwas to him conclusive evidence of the spontaneous origin of such\r\nfungi.  And he accounts for the absence of life in many of his\r\nexperiments by an hypothesis which will not bear a moment's\r\nexamination.  But, knowing that organic particles may pass unscathed\r\nthrough alkalies and acids, the results of Dr. Bennett are precisely\r\nwhat ought wider the circumstances to be expected.  Indeed, their\r\nharmony with the conditions now revealed is a proof of the honesty and\r\naccuracy with which they were executed.\r\n\r\nThe caution exercised by Pasteur both in the execution of his\r\nexperiments, and in the reasoning based upon them, is perfectly\r\nevident to those who, through the practice of severe experimental\r\nenquiry, have rendered themselves competent to judge of good\r\nexperimental work.  He found germs in the mercury used to isolate his\r\nair.  He was never sure that they did not cling to the instruments he\r\nemployed, or to his own person.  Thus when he opened his hermetically\r\nsealed flasks upon the Mer de Glace, he had his eye upon the file used\r\nto detach the drawn-out necks of his bottles; and he was careful to\r\nstand to leeward when each flask was opened.  Using these precautions,\r\nhe found the glacier air incompetent, in nineteen cases out of twenty,\r\nto generate life; while similar flasks, opened amid the vegetation of\r\nthe lowlands, were soon crowded with living things.  M. Pouchet\r\nrepeated Pasteur's experiments in the Pyrenees, adopting the\r\nprecaution of holding his flasks above his head, and obtaining a\r\ndifferent result.  Now great care would be needed to render this\r\nprocedure a real precaution.  The luminous beam at once shows us its\r\npossible effect.  Let smoking brown paper be placed at the open mouth\r\nof a glass shade, so that the smoke shall ascend and fill the shade. A\r\nbeam sent through the shade forms a bright track through the smoke.\r\nWhen the closed fist is placed underneath the shade, a vertical wind\r\nof surprising violence, considering the small elevation of\r\ntemperature, rises from the band, displacing by comparatively dark air\r\nthe illuminated smoke.  Unless special care were taken such a wind\r\nwould rise from M. Pouchet's body as he held his flasks above his\r\nhead, and thus the precaution of Pasteur, of not coming between the\r\nwind and the flask, would be annulled.\r\n\r\nLet me now direct attention to another result of Pasteur, the cause\r\nand significance of which are at once revealed by the luminous beam.\r\nHe prepared twenty one flasks, each containing a decoction of yeast,\r\nfiltered and clear.  He boiled the decoction so as to destroy whatever\r\ngerms it might contain, and, while the space above the liquid was\r\nfilled with pure steam, he sealed his flasks with a blow-pipe.  He\r\nopened ten of them in the deep, damp caves of the Paris Observatory,\r\nand eleven of them in the courtyard of the establishment.  Of the\r\nformer, one only showed signs of life subsequently.  In nine out of\r\nthe ten flasks no organisms of any kind were developed.  In all the\r\nothers organisms speedily appeared.\r\n\r\nNow here is an experiment conducted in Paris, on which we can throw\r\nobvious light in London.  Causing our luminous beam to pass through a\r\nlarge flask filled with the air of this room, and charged with its\r\ngerms and its dust, the beam is seen crossing the flask from side to\r\nside.  But here is another similar flask, which cuts a clear gap out\r\nof the beam.  It is filled with _unfiltered_ air, and still no trace of\r\nthe beam is visible.  Why?  By pure accident I stumbled on this flask\r\nin our apparatus room, where it had remained quiet for some time.\r\nActing upon this obvious suggestion I set aside three other flasks,\r\nfilled, in the first instance, with mote-laden air.  They are now\r\noptically empty.  Our former experiments proved that the\r\nlife-producing particles attach themselves to the fibres of\r\ncotton-wool.  In the present experiment the motes have been brought by\r\ngentle air-currents, established by slight differences of temperature\r\nwithin our closed vessels, into contact with the interior surface, to\r\nwhich they adhere.  The air of these flasks has deposited its dust,\r\ngerms and all, and is practically free from suspended matter.\r\n\r\nI had a chamber erected, the lower half of which is of wood, its upper\r\nhalf being enclosed by four glazed window-frames.  It tapers to a\r\ntruncated cone at the top.  It measures in plan 3 ft.  by 2 ft.  6 in,\r\nand its height is 5 ft.  10 in.  On February 6 it was closed, every\r\ncrevice that could admit dust, or cause displacement of the air, being\r\ncarefully pasted over with paper.  The electric beam at first revealed\r\nthe dust within the chamber as it did in the air of the laboratory.\r\nThe chamber was examined almost daily; a perceptible diminution of the\r\nfloating matter being noticed as time advanced.  At the end of a week\r\nthe chamber was optically empty, exhibiting no trace of matter\r\ncompetent to scatter the light.  Such must have been the case in the\r\nstagnant caves of the Paris Observatory.  Were our electric beam sent\r\nthrough the air of these caves its track would be invisible; thus\r\nshowing the indissoluble association of the scattering of light by air\r\nand its power to generate life.\r\n\r\nI will now turn to what seems to me a more interesting application of\r\nthe luminous beam than any hitherto described.  My reference to\r\nProfessor Lister's interpretation of the fact, that air which has\r\npassed through the lungs cannot produce putrefaction, is fresh in your\r\nmemories.  'Why air,' said he, 'introduced into the pleural cavity,\r\nthrough a wounded lung, should have such wholly different effects from\r\nthat entering through a permanently open wound, penetrating from\r\nwithout, was to me a complete mystery, till I heard of the germ\r\ntheory of putrefaction, when it at once occurred to me that it was\r\nonly natural that the air should be filtered of germs by the air\r\npassages, one of whose offices is to arrest inhaled particles of\r\ndust, and prevent them from entering the air-cells.'\r\n\r\nHere is a surmise which bears the stamp of genius, but which needs\r\nverification.  If, for the words 'it is only natural' we were\r\nauthorised to write 'it is perfectly certain,' the demonstration would\r\nbe complete.  Such demonstration is furnished by experiments with a\r\nbeam of light.  One evening, towards the close of 1869, while pouring\r\nvarious pure gases across the dusty track of a luminous beam, the\r\nthought occurred to me of using my breath instead of the gases.  I\r\nthen noticed, for the first time, the extraordinary darkness produced\r\nby the expired air, _towards the end of the expiration_.  Permit me to\r\nrepeat the experiment in your presence.  I fill my lungs with ordinary\r\nair and breathe through a glass tube across the beam.  The\r\ncondensation of the aqueous vapour of the breath is shown by the\r\nformation of a luminous white cloud of delicate texture.  We abolish\r\nthis cloud by drying the breath previous to its entering the beam; or,\r\nstill more simply, by warming the glass tube.  The luminous track of\r\nthe beam is for a time uninterrupted by the breath, because the dust\r\nreturning from the lungs makes good, in great part, the particles\r\ndisplaced.  After a time, however, an obscure disk appears in the\r\nbeam, the darkness of which increases, until finally, towards the end\r\nof the expiration, the beam is, as it were, pierced by an intensely\r\nblack hole, in which no particles whatever can be discerned.  The\r\ndeeper air of the lungs is thus proved to be absolutely free from\r\nsuspended matter.  It is therefore in the precise condition required\r\nby Professor Lister's explanation.  This experiment may be repeated\r\nany number of times with the same result.  I think it must be regarded\r\nas a crowning piece of evidence both of the correctness of Professor\r\nLister's views and of the impotence, as regards vital development, of\r\noptically pure air. [Footnote: Dr. Burden Sanderson draws attention to\r\nthe important observation of Brauell, which shows that the _contagium_\r\nof a pregnant animal, suffering from splenic fever, is not found in\r\nthe blood of the foetus; the placental apparatus acting as a filter,\r\nand holding back the infective particles.]\r\n\r\nApplication of Luminous beams to Water.\r\n\r\nThe method of examination here pursued is also applicable to water. It\r\nis in some sense complementary to that of the microscope, and may, I\r\nthink, materially aid enquiries conducted with that instrument.  In\r\nmicroscopic examination attention is directed to a small portion of\r\nthe liquid, and the aim is to detect the individual particles.  By the\r\npresent method a large portion of the liquid is illuminated, the\r\ncollective action of the particles being revealed, by the scattered\r\nlight.  Care is taken to defend the eye from the access of all other\r\nlight, and, thus defended, it becomes an organ of inconceivable\r\ndelicacy.  Indeed, an amount of impurity so infinitesimal as to be\r\nscarcely expressible in numbers, and the individual particles of which\r\nare so small as wholly to elude the microscope, may, when examined by\r\nthe method alluded to, produce not only sensible, but striking,\r\neffects upon the eye.\r\n\r\nWe will apply the method, in the first place, to an experiment of M.\r\nPouchet intended to prove conclusively that animalcular life is\r\ndeveloped in cases where no antecedent germs could possibly exist. He\r\nproduced water from the combustion of hydrogen in air, justly arguing\r\nthat no germ could survive the heat of a hydrogen flame.  But he\r\noverlooked the fact that his aqueous vapour was condensed in the air,\r\nand was allowed as water to trickle through the air.  Indeed the\r\nexperiment is one of a number by which workers like M. Pouchet are\r\ndifferentiated from workers like Pasteur.  I will show you some water,\r\nproduced by allowing a hydrogen flame to play upon a polished silver\r\ncondenser, formed by the bottom of a silver basin, containing ice. The\r\ncollected liquid is pellucid in the common light; but in the condensed\r\nelectric beam it is seen to be laden with particles, so thick-strewn\r\nand minute as to produce a continuous luminous cone.  In passing\r\nthrough the air the water loaded itself with this matter; and the\r\ndeportment of such water could obviously have no influence in deciding\r\nthis great question.\r\n\r\nWe are invaded with dirt not only in the air we breathe, but in the\r\nwater we drink.  To prove this I take the bottle of water intended to\r\nquench your lecturer's thirst; which, in the track of the beam, simply\r\nreveals itself as dirty water.  And this water is no worse than the\r\nother London waters.  Thanks to the kindness of Professor Frankland, I\r\nhave been furnished with specimens of the water of eight London\r\ncompanies.  They are all laden with impurities mechanically suspended.\r\nBut you will ask whether filtering will not remove the suspended\r\nmatter?  The grosser matter, undoubtedly, but not the more finely\r\ndivided matter.  Water may be passed any number of times through\r\nbibulous paper, it will continue laden with fine matter.  Water passed\r\nthrough Lipscomb's charcoal filter, or through the filters of the\r\nSilicated Carbon Company, has its grosser matter removed, but it is\r\nthick with fine matter.  Nine-tenths of the light scattered by these\r\nsuspended particles is perfectly polarised in a direction at right\r\nangles to the beam, and this release of the particles from the\r\nordinary law of polarisation is a demonstration of their smallness.  I\r\nshould say by far the greater number of the particles concerned in\r\nthis scattering are wholly beyond the range of the microscope, and no\r\nordinary filter can intercept such particles.  It is next to\r\nimpossible, by artificial means, to produce a pure water.  Mr.\r\nHartley, for example, some time ago distilled water while surrounded\r\nby hydrogen, but the water was not free from floating matter.  It is\r\nso hard to be clean in the midst of dirt.  In water from the Lake of\r\nGeneva, which has remained long without being stirred, we have an\r\napproach to the pure liquid.  I have a bottle of it here, which was\r\ncarefully filled for me by my distinguished friend Soret.  The track\r\nof the beam through it is of a delicate sky-blue; there is scarcely a\r\ntrace of grosser matter.\r\n\r\nThe purest water that I have seen--probably the purest which has been\r\nseen hitherto--has been obtained from the fusion of selected specimens\r\nof ice.  But extraordinary precautions are required to obtain this\r\ndegree of purity.  The following apparatus has been constructed for\r\nthis purpose: Through the plate of an air-pump passes the shank of a\r\nlarge funnel, attached to which below the plate is a clean glass bulb.\r\nIn the funnel is placed a block of the most transparent ice, and over\r\nthe funnel a glass receiver.  This is first exhausted and refilled\r\nseveral times with air, filtered by its passage through cotton-wool,\r\nthe ice being thus surrounded by pure moteless air.  But the ice has\r\npreviously been in contact with mote-filled air; it is therefore\r\nnecessary to let it wash its own surface, and also to wash the bulb\r\nwhich is to receive the water of liquefaction.  The ice is permitted\r\nto melt, the bulb is filled and emptied several times, until finally\r\nthe large block dwindles to a small one.  We may be sure that all\r\nimpurity has been thus removed from the surface of the ice. The water\r\nobtained in this way is the purest hitherto obtained.  Still I should\r\nhesitate to call it absolutely pure.  When condensed light is sent\r\nthrough it, the track of the beam is not invisible, but of the most\r\nexquisitely delicate blue.  This blue is purer than that of the sky,\r\nso that the matter which produces it must be finer than that of the\r\nsky.  It may be and indeed has been, contended that this blue is\r\nscattered by the very molecules of the water, and not by matter\r\nsuspended in the water.  But when we remember that this perfection of\r\nblue is approached gradually through stages of less perfect blue; and\r\nwhen we consider that a blue in all respects similar is demonstrably\r\nobtainable from particles mechanically suspended, we should hesitate,\r\nI think, to conclude that we have arrived here at the last stage of\r\npurification.  The evidence, I think, points distinctly to the\r\nconclusion that, could we push the process of purification still\r\nfarther, even this last delicate trace of blue would disappear.\r\n\r\nChalk-water.  Clark's Softening Process.\r\n\r\nBut is it not possible to match the water of the Lake of Geneva here\r\nin England?  Undoubtedly it is.  We have in England a kind of rock\r\nwhich constitutes at once an exceedingly clean recipient and a natural\r\nfilter, and from which we can obtain water extremely free from\r\nmechanical impurities.  I refer to the chalk formation, in which large\r\nquantities of water are held in store.  Our chalk hills are in most\r\ncases covered with thin layers of soil, and with very scanty\r\nvegetation.  Neither opposes much obstacle to the entry of the rain\r\ninto the chalk, where any organic impurity which the water may carry\r\nin is soon oxidised and rendered harmless.  Those who have scampered\r\nlike myself over the downs of Hants and Wilts will remember the\r\nscarcity of water in these regions.  In fact, the rainfall, instead of\r\nwashing the surface and collecting in streams, sinks into the fissured\r\nchalk and percolates through it.  When this formation is suitably\r\ntapped, we obtain water of exceeding briskness and purity.  A large\r\nglass globe, filled with the water of a well near Tring, shows itself\r\nto be wonderfully free from mechanical impurity.  Indeed, it stands to\r\nreason that water wholly withdrawn from surface contamination, and\r\npercolating through so clean a substance, should be pure.  It has been\r\na subject much debated, whether the supply of excellent water which\r\nthe chalk holds in store could not be rendered available for London.\r\nMany of the most eminent engineers and chemists have ardently\r\nrecommended this source, and have sought to show, not only that its\r\npurity is unrivalled, but that its quantity is practically\r\ninexhaustible.  Data sufficient to test this are now, I believe, in\r\nexistence; the number of wells sunk in the chalk being so\r\nconsiderable, and the quantity of water which they yield so well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nBut this water, so admirable as regards freedom from mechanical\r\nimpurity, labours under the disadvantage of being rendered very hard\r\nby the carbonate of lime which it holds in solution.  The chalk-water\r\nin the neighbourhood of Watford contains about seventeen grains of\r\ncarbonate of lime per gallon.  This, in the old terminology, used to\r\nbe called seventeen degrees of hardness.  This hard water is bad for\r\ntea, bad for washing, and it furs our boilers, because the lime held\r\nin solution is precipitated by boiling.  If the water be used cold,\r\nits hardness must be neutralised at the expense of soap, before it\r\nwill give a lather.  These are serious objections to the use of\r\nchalk-water in London.  But they are successfully met by the fact that\r\nsuch water can be softened inexpensively, and on a grand scale.  I had\r\nlong known the method of softening water called Clark's process, but\r\nnot until recently, under the guidance of Mr. Homersham, did I see\r\nproof of its larger applications.  The chalk-water is softened for the\r\nsupply of the city of Canterbury; and at the Chiltern Hills it is\r\nsoftened for the supply of Tring and Aylesbury.  Caterham also enjoys\r\nthe luxury.\r\n\r\nI have visited all these places, and made myself acquainted with the\r\nworks.  At Canterbury there are three reservoirs covered in and\r\nprotected, by a concrete roof and layers of pebbles, both from the\r\nsummer's heat and the winter's cold.  Each reservoir holds 120,000\r\ngallons of water.  Adjacent to these reservoirs are others containing\r\npure slaked lime--the so-called 'cream of lime.' These being filled\r\nwith water, the lime and water are thoroughly mixed by air forced by\r\nan engine through apertures in the bottom of the reservoir.  The water\r\nsoon dissolves all the lime it is capable of dissolving.  The\r\nmechanically suspended lime is then allowed to subside to the bottom,\r\nleaving a perfectly transparent lime-water behind.\r\n\r\nThe softening process is this: Into one of the empty reservoirs is\r\nintroduced a certain quantity of the clear lime-water, and after this\r\nabout nine times the quantity of the chalk-water.  The transparency\r\nimmediately disappears--the mixture of the two clear liquids becoming\r\nthickly turbid, through the precipitation of carbonate of lime.  The\r\nprecipitate is crystalline and heavy, and in about twelve hours a\r\nlayer of pure white carbonate of lime is formed at the bottom of the\r\nreservoir, with a water of extraordinary beauty and purity overhead. A\r\nfew days ago I pitched some halfpence into a reservoir sixteen feet\r\ndeep at the Chiltern Hills.  This depth hardly dimmed the coin.  Had I\r\ncast in a pin, it could have been seen at the bottom.  By this process\r\nof softening, the water is reduced from about seventeen degrees of\r\nhardness, to three degrees of hardness.  It yields a lather\r\nimmediately.  Its temperature is constant throughout the year.  In the\r\nhottest summer it is cool, its temperature being twenty degrees above\r\nthe freezing point; and it does not freeze in winter if conveyed in\r\nproper pipes.  The reservoirs are covered; a leaf cannot blow into\r\nthem, and no surface contamination can reach the water.  It passes\r\ndirect from the main into the house tap; no cisterns are employed, and\r\nthe supply is always fresh and pure.  This is the kind of water which\r\nis supplied to the fortunate people of Tring, Caterham, and\r\nCanterbury.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe foregoing article, as far as it relates to the theory which\r\nascribes epidemic disease to the development of low parasitic life\r\nwithin the human life, was embodied in a discourse delivered before\r\nthe Royal Institution in January 1870.  In June 1871, after a brief\r\nreference to the polarisation of light by cloudy matter, I ventured to\r\nrecur to the subject in these terms: What is the practical use of\r\nthese curiosities?  If we exclude the interest attached to the\r\nobservation of new facts, and the enhancement of that interest through\r\nthe knowledge that facts often become the exponents of laws, these\r\ncuriosities are in themselves worth little.  They will not enable us\r\nto add to our stock of food, or drink, or clothes, or jewellery.  But\r\nthough thus shorn of all usefulness in themselves, they may, by\r\ncarrying thought into places which it would not otherwise have\r\nentered, become the antecedents of practical consequences.  In\r\nlooking, for example, at our illuminated dust, we may ask ourselves\r\nwhat it is.  How does it act, not upon a beam of light, but upon our\r\nown bodies?  The question then assumes a practical character.  We find\r\non examination that this dust is mainly organic matter--in part\r\nliving, in part dead.  There are among it particles of ground straw,\r\ntorn rags, smoke, the pollen of flowers, the spores of fungi, and the\r\ngerms of other things.  But what have they to do with the animal\r\neconomy?  Let me give you an illustration to which my attention has\r\nbeen lately drawn by Mr. George Henry Lewes, who writes to me thus:\r\n\r\n'I wish to direct your attention to the experiments of von\r\nRecklingshausen should you happen not to know them.  They are striking\r\nconfirmations of what you say of dust and disease.  Last spring, when\r\nI was at his laboratory in Wuerzburg, I examined with him blood that\r\nhad been three weeks, a month, and five weeks, out of the body,\r\npreserved in little porcelain cups under glass shades.  This blood was\r\nliving and growing.  Not only were the Amoeba-like movements of the\r\nwhite corpuscles present, but there were abundant evidences of the\r\ngrowth and development of the corpuscles.  (I also saw a frog's heart\r\nstill pulsating which had been removed from the body I forget how many\r\ndays, but certainly more than a week).  There were other examples of\r\nthe same persistent vitality, or absence of putrefaction.  Von\r\nRecklingshausen did not attribute this to the absence of germs--germs\r\nwere not mentioned by him; but when I asked him how he represented the\r\nthing to himself, he said the whole mystery of his operation consisted\r\nin keeping the blood _free from dirt_.  The instruments employed were\r\nraised to a red heat just before use; the thread was silver thread and\r\nwas similarly treated; and the porcelain cups, though not kept free\r\nfrom air, were kept free from currents.  He said he often had\r\nfailures, and these he attributed to particles of dust having escaped\r\nhis precautions.'\r\n\r\nProfessor Lister, who has founded upon the removal or destruction of\r\nthis 'dirt' momentous improvements in surgery, tells us the effect of\r\nits introduction into the blood of wounds.  The blood would putrefy\r\nand become fetid; and when you examine more closely what putrefaction\r\nmeans, you find the putrefying substance swarming with infusorial\r\nlife, the germs of which have been derived from the atmospheric dust.\r\n\r\nWe are now assuredly in the midst of practical matters; and with your\r\npermission I will refer once more to a question which has recently\r\noccupied a good deal of public attention.  As regards the lowest forms\r\nof life, the world is divided, and has for a long time been divided,\r\ninto two parties, the one affirming that we have only to submit\r\nabsolutely dead matter to certain physical conditions, to evolve from\r\nit living things; the other (without wishing to set bounds to the\r\npower of matter) affirming that, in our day, life has never been found\r\nto arise independently of pre-existing life.  I belong to the party\r\nwhich claims life as a derivative of life.  The question has two\r\nfactors--the evidence, and the mind that judges of the evidence; and\r\nit may be purely a mental set or bias on my part that causes me\r\nthroughout this long discussion, to see, on the one side, dubious\r\nfacts and defective logic, and on the other side firm reasoning and a\r\nknowledge of what rigid experimental enquiry demands.  But, judged of\r\npractically, what, again, has the question of Spontaneous Generation\r\nto do with us?  Let us see.  There are numerous diseases of men and\r\nanimals that are demonstrably the products of parasitic life, and such\r\ndiseases may take the most terrible epidemic forms, as in the case of\r\nthe silkworms of France, referred to at an earlier part of this\r\narticle.  Now it is in the highest degree important to know whether\r\nthe parasites in question are spontaneously developed, or whether they\r\nhave been wafted from without to those afflicted with the disease. The\r\nmeans of prevention, if not of cure, would be widely different in the\r\ntwo cases.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all.  Besides these universally admitted cases, there\r\nis the broad theory, now broached and daily growing in strength and\r\nclearness--daily, indeed, gaining more and more of assent from the\r\nmost successful workers and profound thinkers of the medical\r\nprofession itself--the theory, namely, that contagious disease,\r\ngenerally, is of this parasitic character.  Had I any cause to regret\r\nhaving introduced this theory to your notice more than a year ago,\r\nthat regret should now be expressed.  I would certainly renounce in\r\nyour presence whatever leaning towards the germ theory my words might\r\nthen have betrayed.  But since the time referred to nothing has\r\noccurred to shake my conviction of the truth of the theory.  Let me\r\nbriefly state the grounds on which its supporters rely.  From their\r\nrespective viruses you may plant typhoid fever, scarlatina, or\r\nsmall-pox.  What is the crop that arises from this husbandry?  As\r\nsurely as a thistle rises from a thistle seed, as surely as the fig\r\ncomes from the fig, the grape from the grape, the thorn from the\r\nthorn, so surely does the typhoid virus increase and multiply into\r\ntyphoid fever, the scarlatina virus into scarlatina, the small-pox\r\nvirus into small-pox.  What is the conclusion that suggests itself\r\nhere?  It is this: That the thing which we vaguely call a virus is to\r\nall intents and purposes a seed.  Excluding the notion of vitality, in\r\nthe whole range of chemical science you cannot point to an action\r\nwhich illustrates this perfect parallelism with the phenomena of\r\nlife--this demonstrated power of self-multiplication and reproduction.\r\nThe germ theory alone accounts for the phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn cases of epidemic disease, it is not on bad air or foul drains that\r\nthe attention of the physician of the future will primarily be fixed,\r\nbut upon disease germs, which no bad air or foul drains can create,\r\nbut which may be pushed by foul air into virulent energy of\r\nreproduction.  You may think I am treading on dangerous ground, that I\r\nam putting forth views that may interfere with salutary practice.  No\r\nsuch thing.  If you wish to learn the impotence of medical practice in\r\ndealing with contagious diseases, you have only to refer to the\r\nHarveian oration for 1871, by Sir William Gull.  Such diseases defy\r\nthe physician.  They must run their course, and the utmost that can be\r\ndone for them is careful nursing.  And this, though I do not specially\r\ninsist upon it, would favour the idea of their vital origin.  For if\r\nthe seeds of contagious disease be themselves living things, it may be\r\ndifficult to destroy either them or their progeny, without involving\r\ntheir living habitat in the same destruction.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and it is sure to be repeated, that I am quitting my\r\nown métier, in speaking of these things.  Not so.  I am dealing with\r\na question on which minds accustomed to weigh the value of\r\nexperimental evidence are alone competent to decide, and regarding\r\nwhich, in its present condition, minds so trained are as capable of\r\nforming an opinion as regarding the phenomena of magnetism or radiant\r\nheat.  'The germ theory of disease,' it has been said, 'appertains to\r\nthe biologist and the physician.' Where, I would ask in reply, is the\r\nbiologist or physician, whose researches, in connection with this\r\nsubject, could for one instant be compared to those of the chemist\r\nPasteur?  It is not the philosophic members of the medical profession\r\nwho are dull to the reception of truth not originated within the pale\r\nof the profession itself.  I cannot better conclude this portion of my\r\nstory than by reading to you an extract from a letter addressed to me\r\nsome time ago by Dr. William Budd, of Clifton, to whose insight and\r\nenergy the town of Bristol owes so much in the way of sanitary\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n'As to the germ theory itself,' writes Dr. Budd, that is a matter on\r\nwhich I have long since made up my mind.  From the day when I first\r\nbegan to think of these subjects I have never had a doubt that the\r\nspecific cause of contagious fevers must be living organisms.\r\n\r\n'It is impossible, in fact, to make any statement bearing upon the\r\nessence or distinctive characters of these fevers, without using terms\r\nwhich are of all others _the most distinctive of life_.  Take up the\r\nwritings of the most violent opponent of the germ theory, and, ten to\r\none, you will find them full of such terms as \"propagation,\"\r\n\"self-propagation,\" \"reproduction,\" \"self-multiplication,\" and so on.\r\nTry as he may--if he has anything to say of those diseases which is\r\ncharacteristic of them--he cannot evade the use of these terms, or the\r\nexact equivalents to them.  While perfectly applicable to living\r\nthings, these terms express qualities which are not only inapplicable\r\nto common chemical agents, but, as far as I can see, actually\r\ninconceivable of them.'\r\n\r\nCotton-wool Respirator.\r\n\r\nOnce, then, established within the body, this evil form of life, if\r\nyou will allow me to call it so, must run its course.  Medicine as yet\r\nis powerless to arrest its progress, and the great point to be aimed\r\nat is to prevent its access to the body.  It was with this thought in\r\nmy mind that I ventured to recommend, more than a year ago, the use of\r\ncotton-wool respirators in infectious places.  I would here repeat my\r\nbelief in their efficacy if properly constructed.  But I do not wish\r\nto prejudice the use of these respirators, by connecting them\r\nindissolubly with the germ theory.  There are too many trades in\r\nEngland where life is shortened and rendered miserable by the\r\nintroduction of matters into the lungs which might be kept out of\r\nthem.  Dr. Greenhow has shown the stony grit deposited in the lungs of\r\nstonecutters.  The black lungs of colliers is another case in point.\r\nIn fact, a hundred obvious cases might be cited, and others that are\r\nnot obvious might be added to them.  We should not, for example, think\r\nthat printing implied labour where the use of cotton-wool respirators\r\nmight come into play; but the fact is that the dust arising from the\r\nsorting of the type is very destructive of health.  I went some time\r\nago into a manufactory in one of our large towns, where iron vessels\r\nare enamelled by coating them with a mineral powder, and subjecting\r\nthem to a heat sufficient to fuse the powder.  The organisation of the\r\nestablishment was excellent, and one thing only was needed to make it\r\nfaultless.  In a large room a number of women were engaged covering\r\nthe vessels.  The air was laden with the fine dust, and their faces\r\nappeared as white and bloodless as the powder with which they worked.\r\nBy the use of cotton-wool respirators these women might be caused to\r\nbreathe air as free from suspended matter as that of the open street.\r\nOver a year ago a Lancashire seedsman wrote to me, stating that during\r\nthe seed season his men suffered horribly from irritation and fever,\r\nso that many of them left his service.  He asked for help, and I gave\r\nhim my advice.  At the conclusion of the season, this year, he wrote\r\nto inform me that he had folded a little cotton-wool in muslin, and\r\ntied it in front of the mouth; and that with this simple defence he\r\nhad passed through the season in comfort, and without a single\r\ncomplaint from his men.\r\n\r\nAgainst the use of such a respirator the obvious objection arises,\r\nthat it becomes wet and heated by the breath.  While casting about for\r\na remedy for this, a friend forwarded to me from Newcastle a form of\r\nrespirator invented by Mr. Carrick, a hotel-keeper at Glasgow, which,\r\nby a slight modification, may be caused to meet the case perfectly.\r\nThe respirator, with its back in part removed, is shown in fig. 4.\r\nUnder the partition of wire-gauze q r, is a space intended by Mr.\r\nCarrick for 'medicated substances,' and which may be filled with\r\ncotton-wool.  The mouth is placed against the aperture o, which fits\r\nclosely round the lips, and the filtered air enters the mouth through\r\na light valve v, which is lifted by the act of inhalation.\r\n\r\nDuring exhalation this valve closes; the breath escapes by a second\r\nvalve, v', into the open air.  The wool is thus kept dry and cool; the\r\nair in passing through it being filtered of everything it holds in\r\nsuspension.  The respirator has since taken other forms.\r\n\r\nFIG.  4.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nFireman's Respirator.\r\n\r\nWe have thus been led by our first unpractical experiments into a\r\nthicket of practical considerations.  But another step is possible.\r\nAdmiring, as I do, the bravery of our firemen, and hearing that smoke\r\nwas a more serious enemy than flame itself, I thought of devising a\r\nfireman's respirator.\r\n\r\nOur fire-escapes are each in charge of a single man, and it would be\r\nof obvious importance to place it in the power of each of those men to\r\npenetrate through the densest smoke, into the recesses of a house, and\r\nthere to rescue those who would otherwise be suffocated or burnt.\r\nCotton-wool, which so effectually arrested dust, was first tried; but,\r\nthough found soothing in certain gentle kinds of smoke, it was no\r\nmatch for the pungent fumes of a resinous fire.  For the purpose of\r\ncatching the atmospheric germs, M. Pouchet spread a film of glycerine\r\non a plate of glass, urged air against the film, and examined the dust\r\nwhich stuck to it.  The moistening of the cotton-wool with glycerine\r\nwas a decided improvement; still the respirator only enabled us to\r\nremain in dense smoke for three or four minutes, after which the\r\nirritation became unendurable.  Reflection suggested that, besides the\r\nsmoke, there must be numerous hydrocarbons produced, which, being in a\r\nstate of vapour, would be very imperfectly arrested by the\r\ncotton-wool.  These, in all probability, were the cause of the\r\nresidual irritation; and if these could be removed, a practically\r\nperfect respirator might possibly be obtained.\r\n\r\nI state the reasoning exactly as it occurred to my mind.  Its result\r\nwill be anticipated by many present.  All bodies possess the power of\r\ncondensing, in a greater or less degree, gases and vapours upon their\r\nsurfaces, and when the condensing body is very porous, or in a fine\r\nstate of division, the force of condensation may produce very\r\nremarkable effects.  Thus, a clean piece of platinum-foil placed in a\r\nmixture of oxygen and hydrogen so squeezes the gases together as to\r\ncause them to combine; and if the experiment be made with care, the\r\nheat of combination may raise the platinum to bright redness.  The\r\npromptness of this action is greatly augmented by reducing the\r\nplatinum to a state of fine division.  A pellet of 'spongy platinum,'\r\nfor instance, plunged into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, causes\r\nthe gases to explode instantly.  In virtue of its extreme porosity, a\r\nsimilar power is possessed by charcoal.  It is not strong enough to\r\ncause the oxygen and hydrogen to combine like the spongy platinum, but\r\nit so squeezes the more condensable vapours, and acts with such\r\ncondensing power upon the oxygen of the air, as to bring both within\r\nthe combining distance, thus enabling the oxygen to attack and destroy\r\nthe vapours in the pores of the charcoal.  In this way, effluvia of\r\nall kinds may be virtually burnt up; and this is the principle of the\r\nexcellent charcoal respirators invented by Dr. Stenhouse.  Armed with\r\none of these, you may go into the foulest-smelling places without\r\nhaving your nose offended.\r\n\r\nBut, while powerful to arrest vapours, the charcoal respirator is\r\nineffectual as regards smoke.  The smoke-particles get freely through\r\nthe respirator.  With a number of such respirators, tested in a proper\r\nroom, from half a minute to a minute was the limit of endurance.  This\r\nmight be exceeded by Faraday's simple method of emptying the lungs\r\ncompletely, and then filling them before going into a smoky\r\natmosphere.  In fact, each solid smoke particle is itself a bit of\r\ncharcoal, and carries on it, and in it, its little load of irritating\r\nvapour.  It is this, far more than the particles of carbon themselves,\r\nthat produces the irritation.  Hence two causes of offence are to be\r\nremoved: the carbon particles which convey the irritant by adhesion\r\nand condensation, and the free vapour which accompanies the particles.\r\nThe cotton-wool moistened with glycerine I knew would arrest the\r\nfirst; fragments of charcoal I hoped would stop the second.  In the\r\nfirst fireman's respirator, Mr. Carrick's arrangement of two valves,\r\nthe one for inhalation, the other for exhalation, was preserved.  But\r\nthe portion of the respirator which holds the filtering and absorbent\r\nsubstances, was prolonged to a depth of four or five inches (see fig.\r\n5).  Under the partition of wire-gauze q r at the bottom of the space\r\nwhich fronts the mouth was placed a layer of cotton-wool, c, moistened\r\nwith glycerine; then a thin layer of dry wool, c'; then a layer of\r\ncharcoal fragments; and finally a second thin layer of dry\r\ncotton-wool.  The succession of the layers may be changed without\r\nprejudice to the action.  A wire-gauze cover, shown in plan under fig.\r\n5, keeps the substances from falling out of the respirator.  A layer\r\nof caustic lime may be added for the absorption of carbonic acid; but\r\nin the densest smoke that we have hitherto employed, it has not been\r\nfound necessary, nor is it shown in the figure.  In a flaming\r\nbuilding, indeed, the mixture of air with the smoke never permits the\r\ncarbonic acid to become so dense as to be irrespirable; but in a place\r\nwhere the gas is present in undue quantity, the fragments of lime\r\nwould materially mitigate its action.\r\n\r\nIn a small cellar-like chamber with a stone flooring and stone walls,\r\nthe first experiments were made.  We Placed there furnaces containing\r\nresinous pine-wood, lighted the wood, and, placing over it a lid which\r\nprevented too brisk a circulation of the air, generated dense volumes\r\nof smoke.  With our eyes protected by suitable glasses, my assistant\r\nand I have remained for half an hour and more in smoke so dense and\r\npungent that a single inhalation, through the undefended mouth, would\r\nbe perfectly unendurable.  We might have prolonged our stay for hours.\r\n\r\nFIG.  5.\r\n\r\nHaving thus far perfected the instrument, I wrote to the chief officer\r\nof the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, asking him whether such a respirator\r\nwould be of use to him.  His reply was prompt; it would be most\r\nvaluable.  He had, however, made himself acquainted with every\r\ncontrivance of the kind in this and other countries, and had found\r\nnone of them of any practical use.  He offered to come and test it\r\nhere, or to place a room at my disposal in the City.  At my request he\r\ncame here, accompanied by three of his men.  Our small room was filled\r\nwith smoke to their entire satisfaction.  The three men went\r\nsuccessively into it, and remained there as long as Captain Shaw\r\nwished them.  On coming out they said that they had not suffered the\r\nslightest inconvenience; that they could have remained all day in the\r\nsmoke.  Captain Shaw then tested the respirator with the same result,\r\nand he afterwards took great interest in the perfecting of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nVarious ameliorations and improvements have recently been introduced\r\ninto the smoke respirator.  The hood of Captain Shaw has been improved\r\nupon by the simple and less expensive mouthpiece of Mr. Sinclair; and\r\nthis, in its turn, has been simplified and improved by my assistant\r\nMr. John Cottrell.  The respirator is now in considerable demand, and\r\nit has already done good practical service.  Care is, however,\r\nnecessary, in moistening the wool with glycerine.  It must be\r\ncarefully teazed, so that the individual fibres may be moistened, and\r\n_clots_ must be avoided.  I cannot recommend the layers of moistened\r\nflannel which, in some cases, have been used instead of cotton-wool:\r\nnothing equals the wool, when carefully treated.\r\n\r\nAn experiment made last year brought out very conspicuously the\r\nnecessity of careful packing, and the enormous comparative power of\r\nresisting smoke irritation possessed by our firemen, and the able\r\nofficer who commands them.  Having heard from Captain Shaw that, in\r\nsome recent very trying experiments, he had obtained the best effects\r\nfrom dry cotton-wool, and thinking that I could not have been mistaken\r\nin my first results, which proved the dry so much inferior to the\r\nmoistened wool and its associated charcoal, I proposed to Captain Shaw\r\nto bring the matter to a test at his workshops in the City.  He was\r\ngood enough to accept my proposal, and thither I went on May 7, 1874.\r\nThe smoke was generated in a confined space from wet straw, and it was\r\ncertainly very diabolical.\r\n\r\nAt this season of the year I am usually somewhat shorn of vigour, and\r\ntherefore not in the best condition for severe experiments; still I\r\nwished to test the matter in my own person.  With a respirator which\r\nhad been in use some days previously, and which was not carefully\r\npacked, I followed a fireman into the smoke, he being provided with a\r\ndry-wool respirator.  I was compelled to quit the place in about three\r\nminutes, while the fireman remained there for six or seven minutes.\r\n\r\nI then tried his respirator upon myself, and found that with it I\r\ncould not remain more than a minute in the smoke; in fact the first\r\ninhalation provoked coughing.\r\n\r\nThinking that Captain Shaw himself might have lungs more like mine\r\nthan those of his fireman, I proposed that we should try the\r\nrespirators together; but he informed me that his lungs were very\r\nstrong.  He was, however, good enough to accede to my request. Before\r\nentering the den a second time I repacked my respirator, with due\r\ncare, and entered the smoke in company with Captain Shaw.  I could\r\nhear him breathe long slow inhalations; his labour was certainly\r\ngreater than mine, and after the lapse of seven minutes I heard him\r\ncough.  In seven and a half minutes he had to quit the place, thus\r\nproving that his lungs were able to endure the irritation seven times\r\nas long as mine could bear it.  I continued in the smoke, with hardly\r\nany discomfort, for sixteen minutes, and certainly could have remained\r\nin it much longer.  The advantage arising from the glycerine was thus\r\nplaced beyond question.\r\n\r\nDuring this time I was in a condition to render very material\r\nassistance to a person in danger of suffocation.\r\n\r\nHelmholtz on Hay Fever.\r\n\r\nIn my lecture on Dust and Disease in 1870, I referred to an experiment\r\nmade by Helmholtz upon himself which strikingly connected hay fever\r\nwith animalcular life.  About a year ago I received from Professor\r\nBinz of Bonn a short, but important paper, embracing Helmholtz's\r\naccount of his observation, to which Professor Binz has added some\r\nremarks of his own.  The paper, being mainly intended for English\r\nmedical men, was published in English, and though here and there its\r\nstyle might be amended, I think it better to publish it unaltered.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have observed (says Professor Binz) of recent English\r\npublications on the subject of hay fever, I am led to suppose that\r\nEnglish authorities are inaccurately acquainted with the discovery of\r\nProfessor Helmholtz, as far back as 1868, of the existence of uncommon\r\nlow organisms in the nasal secretions in this complaint, and of the\r\npossibility of arresting their action by the local employment of\r\nquinine.  I therefore purpose to republish the letter in which he\r\noriginally announced these facts to myself, and to add some further\r\nobservations on this topic.  The letter is as follows: [Footnote:\r\nCf.  Virchow's 'Archiv.' vol. xlvi.]\r\n\r\n'I have suffered, as well as I can remember, since the year 1847, from\r\nthe peculiar catarrh called by the English \"hay fever,\" the speciality\r\nof which consists in its attacking its victims regularly in the hay\r\nseason (myself-between May 20 and the end of June), that it ceases in\r\nthe cooler weather, but on the other hand quickly reaches a great\r\nintensity if the patients expose themselves to heat and sunshine.  An\r\nextraordinary violent sneezing then sets in, and a strongly corrosive\r\nthin discharge, with which much epithelium is thrown off.  This\r\nincreases, after a few hours, to a painful inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane and of the outside of the nose, and excites fever with severe\r\nheadache and great depression, if the patient cannot withdraw himself\r\nfrom the heat and the sunshine.  In a cool room, however, these\r\nsymptoms vanish as quickly as they come on, and there then only\r\nremains for a few days a lessened discharge and soreness, as if caused\r\nby the loss of epithelium.  I remark, by the way, that in all my other\r\nyears I had very little tendency to catarrh or catching cold, while\r\nthe hay fever has never failed during the twenty-one years of which I\r\nhave spoken, and has never attacked me earlier or later in the year\r\nthan the times named.  The condition is extremely troublesome, and\r\nincreases, if one is obliged to be much exposed to the sun, to an\r\nexcessively severe malady.\r\n\r\n'The curious dependence of the disease on the season of the year\r\nsuggested to me the thought that organisms might be the origin of the\r\nmischief.  In examining the secretion I regularly found, in the last\r\nfive years, certain vibrio-like bodies in it, which _at other times I\r\ncould not observe_ in my nasal secretion...  They are very\r\nsmall, and can only be recognised with the immersion-lens of a very\r\ngood Hartnack's microscope.  It is characteristic of the common\r\nisolated single joints that they contain four nuclei in a row, of\r\nwhich two pairs are more closely united.  The length of the joints is\r\n0.004 millimetre.  Upon the warm objective-stage they move with\r\nmoderate activity, partly in, mere vibration, partly shooting\r\nbackwards and forwards in the direction of their long axis; in lower\r\ntemperatures they are very inactive.  Occasionally one finds them\r\narranged in rows upon each other, or in branching series.  Observed\r\nsome days in the moist chamber, they vegetated again, and appeared\r\nsomewhat larger and more conspicuous than immediately after their\r\nexcretion.  It is to be noticed that only that kind of secretion\r\ncontains them which is expelled by violent sneezings; that which drops\r\nslowly does not contain any.  They stick tenaciously enough in the\r\nlower cavities and recesses of the nose.\r\n\r\n'When I saw your first notice respecting the poisonous action of\r\nquinine upon infusoria, I determined at once to make an experiment\r\nwith that substance, thinking that these vibrionic bodies, even if\r\nthey did not cause the whole illness, still could render it much more\r\nunpleasant through their movements and the decompositions caused by\r\nthem.  For that reason I made a neutral solution of sulphate of\r\nquinine, which did not contain much of the salt (1·800), but still was\r\neffective enough, and caused moderate irritation on the mucus\r\nmembrane of the nose.  I then lay flat on my back, keeping my head\r\nvery low, and poured with a pipette about four cubic centimetres into\r\nboth nostrils.  Then I turned my head about in order to let the liquid\r\nflow in all directions.\r\n\r\n'The desired effect was obtained immediately, and remained for some\r\nhours; I could expose myself to the sun without fits of sneezing and\r\nthe other disagreeable symptoms coming on.  It was sufficient to\r\nrepeat the treatment three times a day, even under the most\r\nunfavourable circumstances, in order to keep myself quite free.\r\n[Footnote: There is no foundation for the objection that syringing the\r\nnose could not cure the asthma which accompanies hay fever; for this\r\nasthma is only the reflex effect arising from the irritation of the\r\nnose.--B.]  There were then no such vibrios in the secretion.  If I\r\nonly go out in the evening, it suffices to inject the quinine once a\r\nday, just before going.  After continuing this treatment for some days\r\nthe symptoms disappear completely, but if I leave off they return till\r\ntowards the end of June.\r\n\r\n'My first experiments with quinine date from the summer of 1867; this\r\nyear (1868) I began at once as soon as the first traces of the illness\r\nappeared, and I have thus been able to stop its development\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n'I have hesitated as yet in publishing the matter, because I have\r\nfound no other patient [Footnote: Helmholtz, now Professor of\r\nPhysics at the University of Berlin, is, although M.D., no medical\r\npractitioner.--B.] on whom I could try the experiment.  There is, it\r\nseems to me, no doubt, considering the extraordinary regularity in the\r\nrecurrence and course of the illness, that quinine had here a most\r\nquick and decided effect.  And this again makes my hypothesis very\r\nprobable, that the vibrios, although of no specific form but a very\r\nfrequent one, are at least the cause of the rapid increase of the\r\nsymptoms in warm air, as heat excites them to lively action.\r\n\r\nI should be very glad if the above lines would induce medical men in\r\nEngland--the haunt of hay fever--to test the observation of Helmholtz.\r\nTo most patients the application with the pipette may be too difficult\r\nor impossible; I have therefore already suggested the use of Weber's\r\nvery simple but effective nose-douche.  Also it will be advisable to\r\napply the solution of quinine _tepid_.  It can, further, not be repeated\r\noften enough that quinine is frequently adulterated, especially with\r\ncinchona, the action of which is much less to be depended upon.\r\n\r\nDr. Frickhoefer, of Schwalbach, has communicated to me a second case\r\nin which hay fever was cured by local application of quinine.\r\n[Footnote: Cf.  Virchow's 'Archiv.' (1870), vol. li. p. 176.]\r\nProfessor Busch, of Bonn, authorises me to say that he succeeded in\r\ntwo cases of 'catarrhus aestivus' by the same method: a third patient\r\nwas obliged to abstain from the use of quinine, as it produced an\r\nunbearable irritation of the sensible nerves of the nose.  In the\r\nautumn of 1872 Helmholtz told me that his fever was quite cured, and\r\nthat in the meantime two other patients had, by his advice, tried this\r\nmethod, and with the same success. [Footnote: Prof. Helmholtz, whom I\r\nhad the pleasure of meeting in Switzerland last year, then told me\r\nthat he was quite convinced that hay fever was produced by the pollen\r\nafloat in early summer in the atmosphere.]\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nVI. VOYAGE TO ALGERIA TO OBSERVE THE ECLIPSE.\r\n\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nTHE opening of the Eclipse Expedition was not propitious.  Portsmouth,\r\non Monday, December 5, 1870, was swathed by fog, which was intensified\r\nby smoke, and traversed by a drizzle of fine rain.  At six P.M. I was\r\non board the \"Urgent.\" On Tuesday morning the weather was too thick to\r\npermit of the ship's being swung and her compasses calibrated.  The\r\nAdmiral of the port, a man of very noble presence, came on board.\r\nUnder his stimulus the energy which the weather had damped appeared to\r\nbecome more active, and soon after his departure we steamed down to\r\nSpithead.  Here the fog had so far lightened as to enable the officers\r\nto swing the ship.\r\n\r\nAt three P.M. on Tuesday, December 6, we got away, gliding\r\nsuccessively past Whitecliff Bay, Bembridge, Sandown, Shanklin,\r\nVentnor, and St. Catherine's Lighthouse.  On Wednesday morning we\r\nsighted the Isle of Ushant, on the French side of the Channel.  The\r\nnorthern end of the island has been fretted by the waves into detached\r\ntower-like masses of rock of very remarkable appearance.  In the\r\nChannel the sea was green, and opposite Ushant it was a brighter\r\ngreen.  On Wednesday evening we committed ourselves to the Bay of\r\nBiscay.  The roll of the Atlantic was full, but not violent.  There\r\nhad been scarcely a gleam of sunshine throughout the day, but the\r\ncloud-forms were fine, and their apparent solidity impressive.  On\r\nThursday morning the green of the sea was displaced by a deep indigo\r\nblue.  The whole of Thursday we steamed across the bay.  We had little\r\nblue sky, but the clouds were again grand and varied--cirrus, stratus,\r\ncumulus, and nimbus, we had them all.  Dusky hair-like trails were\r\nsometimes dropped from the distant clouds to the sea.\r\n\r\nThese were falling showers, and they sometimes occupied the whole\r\nhorizon, while we steamed across the rainless circle which was thus\r\nsurrounded.  Sometimes we plunged into the rain, and once or twice, by\r\nslightly changing our course, avoided a heavy shower.  From time to\r\ntime perfect rainbows spanned the heavens from side to side.  At times\r\na bow would appear in fragments, showing the keystone of the arch\r\nmidway in air, and its two buttresses on the horizon.  In all cases\r\nthe light of the bow could be quenched by a Nicol's prism, with its\r\nlong diagonal tangent to the arc.  Sometimes gleaming patches of the\r\nfirmament were seen amid the clouds.  When viewed in the proper\r\ndirection, the gleam could be quenched by a Nicol's prism, a dark\r\naperture being thus opened into stellar space.\r\n\r\nAt sunset on Thursday the denser clouds were fiercely fringed, while\r\nthrough the lighter ones seemed to issue the glow of a conflagration.\r\nOn Friday morning we sighted Cape Finisterre--the extreme end of the\r\narc which sweeps from Ushant round the Bay of Biscay.  Calm spaces of\r\nblue, in which floated quietly scraps of cumuli, were behind us, but\r\nin front of us was a horizon of portentous darkness.  It continued\r\nthus threatening throughout the day.  Towards evening the wind\r\nstrengthened to a gale, and at dinner it was difficult to preserve the\r\nplates and dishes from destruction.  Our thinned company hinted that\r\nthe rolling had other consequences.  It was very wild when we went to\r\nbed.  I slumbered and slept, but after some time was rendered\r\nanxiously conscious that my body had become a kind of projectile, with\r\nthe ship's side for a target.  I gripped the edge of my berth to save\r\nmyself from being thrown out.  Outside, I could hear somebody say that\r\nhe had been thrown from his berth, and sent spinning to the other side\r\nof the saloon.  The screw laboured violently amid the lurching; it\r\nincessantly quitted the water, and, twirling in the air, rattled\r\nagainst its bearings, causing the ship to shudder from stem to stern.\r\nAt times the waves struck us, not with the soft impact which might be\r\nexpected from a liquid, but with the sudden solid shock of\r\nbattering-rams.  'No man knows the force of water,' said one of the\r\nofficers,' until he has experienced a storm at sea.' These blows\r\nfollowed each other at quicker intervals, the screw rattling after\r\neach of them, until, finally, the delivery of a heavier stroke than\r\nordinary seemed to reduce the saloon to chaos.  Furniture crashed,\r\nglasses rang, and alarmed enquiries immediately followed.  Amid the\r\nnoises I heard one note of forced laughter; it sounded very ghastly.\r\nMen tramped through the saloon, and busy voices were heard aft, as if\r\nsomething there had gone wrong.\r\n\r\nI rose, and not without difficulty got into my clothes.  In the\r\nafter-cabin, under the superintendence of the able and energetic\r\nnavigating lieutenant, Mr. Brown, a group of blue-jackets were working\r\nat the tiller-ropes.  These had become loose, and the helm refused to\r\nanswer the wheel.  High moral lessons might be gained on shipboard, by\r\nobserving what steadfast adherence to an object can accomplish, and\r\nwhat large effects are heaped up by the addition of infinitesimals.\r\nThe tiller-rope, as the blue-jackets strained in concert, seemed\r\nhardly to move; still it did move a little, until finally, by timing\r\nthe pull to the lurching of the ship, the mastery of the rudder was\r\nobtained.  I had previously gone on deck.  Round the saloon-door were\r\na few members of the eclipse party, who seemed in no mood for\r\nscientific observation.  Nor did I; but I wished to see the storm.  I\r\nclimbed the steps to the poop, exchanged a word with Captain Toynbee,\r\nthe only member of the party to be seen on the poop, and by his\r\ndirection made towards a cleat not far from the wheel. [Footnote: The\r\ncleat is a T-shaped mass of metal employed for the fastening of\r\nropes.] Round it I coiled my arms.  With the exception of the men at\r\nthe wheel, who stood as silent as corpses, I was alone.\r\n\r\nI had seen grandeur elsewhere, but this was a new form of grandeur to\r\nme.  The \"Urgent\" is long and narrow, and during our expedition she\r\nlacked the steadying influence of sufficient ballast. She was for a\r\ntime practically rudderless, and lay in the trough of the sea.  I\r\ncould see the long ridges, with some hundreds of feet between their\r\ncrests, rolling upon the ship perfectly parallel to her sides.  As\r\nthey approached, they so grew upon the eye as to render the expression\r\n'mountains high' intelligible.  At all events, there was no mistaking\r\ntheir mechanical might, as they took the ship upon their shoulders,\r\nand swung her like a pendulum.  The deck sloped sometimes at an angle\r\nwhich I estimated at over forty-five degrees; wanting my previous\r\nAlpine practice, I should have felt less confidence in my grip of the\r\ncleat.  Here and there the long rollers were tossed by interference\r\ninto heaps of greater height.  The wind caught their crests, and\r\nscattered them over the sea, the whole surface of which was seething\r\nwhite.  The aspect of the clouds was a fit accompaniment to the fury\r\nof the ocean.  The moon was almost full--at times concealed, at times\r\nrevealed, as the scud flew wildly over it.  These things appealed to\r\nthe eye, while the ear was filled by the groaning of the screw and the\r\nwhistle and boom of the storm.\r\n\r\nNor was the outward agitation the only object of interest to me.  I\r\nwas at once subject and object to myself, and watched with intense\r\ninterest the workings of my own mind.  The \"Urgent\" is an elderly\r\nship.  She had been built, I was told, by a contracting firm for some\r\nforeign Government, and had been diverted from her first purpose when\r\nconverted into a troop-ship.  She had been for some time out of work,\r\nand I had heard that one of her boilers, at least, needed repair.  Our\r\nscanty but excellent crew, moreover, did not belong to the \"Urgent,\"\r\nbut had been gathered from other ships.  Our three lieutenants were\r\nalso volunteers.  All this passed swiftly through my mind as the\r\nsteamer shook under the blows of the waves, and I thought that\r\nprobably no one on board could say how much of this thumping and\r\nstraining the \"Urgent\" would be able to bear.  This uncertainty caused\r\nme to look steadily at the worst, and I tried to strengthen myself in\r\nthe face of it.\r\n\r\nBut at length the helm laid hold of the water, and the ship was got\r\ngradually round to face the waves.  The rolling diminished, a certain\r\namount of pitching taking its place.  Our speed had fallen from eleven\r\nknots to two.  I went again to bed.  After a space of calm, when we\r\nseemed crossing the vortex of a storm, heavy tossing recommenced.  I\r\nwas afraid to allow myself to fall asleep, as my berth was high, and\r\nto be pitched out of it might be attended with bruises, if not with\r\nfractures.  From Friday at noon to Saturday at noon we accomplished\r\nsixty-six miles, or an average of less than three miles an hour.  I\r\noverheard the sailors talking about this storm.  The \"Urgent,\"\r\naccording to those that knew her, had never previously experienced\r\nanything like it. [Footnote: 'There is, it will be seen, a fair\r\nagreement between these impressions and those so vigorously described\r\nby a scientific correspondent of the 'Times.']\r\n\r\nAll through Saturday the wind, though somewhat sobered, blew dead\r\nagainst us.  The atmospheric effects were exceedingly fine.  The\r\ncumuli resembled mountains in shape, and their peaked summits\r\nshone as white as Alpine snows.  At one place this resemblance was\r\ngreatly strengthened by a vast area of cloud, uniformly illuminated,\r\nand lying like a _névé_ below the peaks.  From it fell a kind of\r\ncloud-river strikingly like a glacier.  The horizon at sunset was\r\nremarkable--spaces of brilliant green between clouds of fiery red.\r\nRainbows had been frequent throughout the day, and at night a\r\nperfectly continuous lunar bow spanned the heavens from side to side.\r\nIts colours were feeble; but, contrasted with the black ground against\r\nwhich it rested, its luminousness was extraordinary.\r\n\r\nSunday morning found us opposite to Lisbon, and at midnight we rounded\r\nCape St. Vincent, where the lurching seemed disposed to recommence.\r\nThrough the kindness of Lieutenant Walton, a cot had been slung for\r\nme.  It hung between a tiller-wheel and a flue, and at one A.M. I was\r\nroused by the banging of the cot against its boundaries.  But the wind\r\nwas now behind us, and we went along at a speed of eleven knots.  We\r\nfelt certain of reaching Cadiz by three.  But a new lighthouse came in\r\nsight, which some affirmed to be Cadiz Lighthouse, while the\r\nsurrounding houses were declared to be those of Cadiz itself. Out of\r\ndeference to these statements, the navigating lieutenant changed his\r\ncourse, and steered for the place.  A pilot came on board, and he\r\ninformed us that we were before the mouth of the Guadalquivir, and\r\nthat the lighthouse was that of Cipiòna.  Cadiz was still some\r\neighteen miles distant.\r\n\r\nWe steered towards the city, hoping to get into the harbour before\r\ndark.  But the pilot who would have guided us had been snapped up by\r\nanother vessel, and we did not get in.  We beat about during the\r\nnight, and in the morning found ourselves about fifteen miles from\r\nCadiz.  The sun rose behind the city, and we steered straight into the\r\nlight.  The three-towered cathedral stood in the midst, round which\r\nswarmed apparently a multitude of chimney-stacks.  A nearer approach\r\nshowed the chimneys to be small turrets.  A pilot was taken on board;\r\nfor there is a dangerous shoal in the harbour.  The appearance of the\r\ntown as the sun shone upon its white and lofty walls was singularly\r\nbeautiful.  We cast anchor; some officials arrived and demanded a\r\nclean bill of health.  We had none.  They would have nothing to do\r\nwith us; so the yellow quarantine flag was hoisted, and we waited for\r\npermission to land the Cadiz party.  After some hours' delay the\r\nEnglish consul and vice-consul came on board, and with them a Spanish\r\nofficer ablaze with gold lace and decorations.  Under slight pressure\r\nthe requisite permission had been granted.  We landed our party, and\r\nin the afternoon weighed anchor.  Thanks to the kindness of our\r\nexcellent paymaster, I was here transferred to a more roomy berth.\r\n\r\nCadiz soon sank beneath the sea, and we sighted in succession Cape\r\nTrafalgar, Tarifa, and the revolving light of Ceuta.  The water was\r\nvery calm, and the moon rose in a quiet heaven.  She swung with her\r\nconvex surface downwards, the common boundary between light and shadow\r\nbeing almost horizontal.  A pillar of reflected light shimmered up to\r\nus from the slightly rippled sea.  I had previously noticed the\r\nphosphorescence of the water, but tonight it was stronger than usual,\r\nespecially among the foam at the bows.  A bucket let down into the sea\r\nbrought up a number of the little sparkling organisms which caused the\r\nphosphorescence.  I caught some of them in my hand.  And here an\r\nappearance was observed which was new to most of us, and strikingly\r\nbeautiful to all.  Standing at the bow and looking forwards, at a\r\ndistance of forty or fifty yards from the ship, a number of luminous\r\nstreamers were seen rushing towards us.  On nearing the vessel they\r\nrapidly turned, like a comet round its perihelion, placed themselves\r\nside by side, and, in parallel trails of light, kept up with the ship.\r\nOne of them placed itself right in front of the bow as a pioneer.\r\nThese comets of the sea were joined at intervals by others.  Sometimes\r\nas many as six at a time would rush at us, bend with extraordinary\r\nrapidity round a sharp curve, and afterwards keep us company.  I\r\nleaned over the bow, and scanned the streamers closely.  The frontal\r\nportion of each of them revealed the outline of a porpoise.  The rush\r\nof the creatures through the water had started the phosphorescence,\r\nevery spark of which was converted by the motion of the retina into a\r\nline of light.  Each porpoise was thus wrapped in a luminous sheath.\r\nThe phosphorescence did not cease at the creature's tail, but was\r\ncarried many porpoise-lengths behind it.\r\n\r\nTo our right we had the African hills, illuminated by the moon.\r\nGibraltar Rock at length became visible, but the town remained long\r\nhidden by a belt of haze, through which at length the brighter lamps\r\nstruggled.  It was like the gradual resolution of a nebula into stars.\r\nAs the intervening depth became gradually less, the mist vanished more\r\nand more, and finally all the lamps shone through it They formed a\r\nbright foil to the sombre mass of rock above them.  The sea was so\r\ncalm and the scene so lovely that Mr. Huggins and myself stayed on\r\ndeck till near midnight, when the ship was moored.  During our walking\r\nto and fro a striking enlargement of the disk of Jupiter was\r\nobserved, whenever the heated air of the funnel came between us and\r\nthe planet.  On passing away from the heated air, the flat dim disk\r\nwould immediately shrink to a luminous point.  The effect was one of\r\nvisual persistence.  The retinal image of the planet was set quivering\r\nin all azimuths by the streams of heated air, describing in quick\r\nsuccession minute lines of light, which summed themselves to a disk of\r\nsensible area.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock next morning, the gun at the Signal Station on the\r\nsummit of the rock, boomed.  At eight the band on board the\r\n'Trafalgar' training-ship, which was in the harbour, struck up the\r\nnational anthem; and immediately afterwards a crowd of mite-like\r\ncadets swarmed up the rigging.  After the removal of the apparatus\r\nbelonging to the Gibraltar party we went on shore.  Winter was in\r\nEngland when we left, but here we had the warmth of summer.  The\r\nvegetation was luxuriant--palm-trees, cactuses, and aloes, all ablaze\r\nwith scarlet flowers.  A visit to the Governor was proposed, as an act\r\nof necessary courtesy, and I accompanied Admiral Ommaney and Mr.\r\nHuggins to 'the Convent,' or Government House.  We sent in our cards,\r\nwaited for a time, and were then conducted by an orderly to his\r\nExcellency.  He is a fine old man, over six feet high, and of frank\r\nmilitary bearing.  He received us and conversed with us in a very\r\ngenial manner.  He took us to see his garden, his palms, his shaded\r\npromenades, and his orange-trees loaded with fruit, in all of which he\r\ntook manifest delight.  Evidently 'the hero of Kars' had fallen upon\r\nquarters after his own heart.  He appeared full of good nature, and\r\nengaged us on the spot to dine with him that day.\r\n\r\nWe sought the town-major for a pass to visit the lines.  While\r\nawaiting his arrival I purchased a stock of white glass bottles, with\r\na view to experiments on the colour of the sea.  Mr. Huggins and\r\nmyself, who wished to see the rock, were taken by Captain Salmond to\r\nthe library, where a model of Gibraltar is kept, and where we had a\r\nuseful preliminary lesson.  At the library we met Colonel Maberly, a\r\ncourteous and kindly man, who gave us good advice regarding our\r\nexcursion.  He sent an orderly with us to the entrance of the lines.\r\nThe orderly handed us over to an intelligent Irishman, who was\r\ndirected to show us everything that we desired to see, and to hide\r\nnothing from us.  We took the 'upper line,' traversed the galleries\r\nhewn through the limestone; looked through the embrasures, which\r\nopened like doors in the precipice, towards the hills of Spain;\r\nreached St. George's hall, and went still higher, emerging on the\r\nsummit of one of the noblest cliffs I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nBeyond were the Spanish lines, marked by a line of white sentry-boxes;\r\nnearer were the English lines, less conspicuously indicated; and\r\nbetween both was the neutral ground.  Behind the Spanish lines rose\r\nthe conical hill called the Queen of Spain's Chair.  The general\r\naspect of the mainland from the rock is bold and rugged.  Doubling\r\nback from the galleries, we struck upwards towards the crest, reached\r\nthe Signal Station, where we indulged in 'shandy-gaff' and bread and\r\ncheese.  Thence to O'Hara's Tower, the highest point of the rock.  It\r\nwas built by a former Governor, who, forgetful of the laws of\r\nterrestrial curvature, thought he might look from the tower into-the\r\nport of Cadiz.  The tower is riven, and it may be climbed along the\r\nedges of the crack.  We got to the top of it; thence descended the\r\ncurious Mediterranean Stair--a zigzag, mostly of steps down a steeply\r\nfalling slope, amid palmetto brush, aloes, and prickly pear.\r\n\r\nPassing over the Windmill Hill, we were joined at the 'Governor's\r\nCottage' by a car, and drove afterwards to the lighthouse at Europa\r\nPoint.  The tower was built, I believe, by Queen Adelaide, and it\r\ncontains a fine dioptric apparatus of the first order, constructed by\r\nMessrs.  Chance, of Birmingham.  At the appointed hour we were at the\r\nConvent.  During dinner the same genial traits which appeared in the\r\nmorning were still more conspicuous.  The freshness of the Governor's\r\nnature showed itself best when he spoke of his old antagonist in arms,\r\nMouravieff.  Chivalry in war is consistent with its stern prosecution.\r\nThese two men were chivalrous, and after striking the last blow became\r\nfriends for ever.  Our kind and courteous reception at Gibraltar is a\r\nthing to be remembered with pleasure.\r\n\r\nOn December 15 we committed ourselves to the Mediterranean.  The views\r\nof Gibraltar with which we are most acquainted represent it as a huge\r\nridge; but its aspect, end on, both from the Spanish lines and from\r\nthe other side, is truly noble.  There is a sloping bank of sand at\r\nthe back of the rock, which I was disposed to regard simply as the\r\n_débris_ of the limestone.  I wished to let myself down upon it, but had\r\nnot the time.  My friend Mr. Busk, however, assures me that it is\r\nsilica, and that the same sand constitutes the adjacent neutral\r\nground.  There are theories afloat as to its having been blown from\r\nSahara.  The Mediterranean throughout this first day, and indeed\r\nthroughout the entire voyage to Oran, was of a less deep blue than the\r\nAtlantic.  Possibly the quantity of organisms may have modified the\r\ncolour.  At night the phosphorescence was startling, breaking suddenly\r\nout along the crests of the waves formed by the port and starboard\r\nbows.  Its strength was not uniform.  Having flashed brilliantly for a\r\ntime, it would in part subside, and afterwards regain its vigour.\r\nSeveral large phosphorescent masses of weird appearance also floated\r\npast.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th we sighted the fort and lighthouse of Marsa\r\nel Kibir, and beyond them the white walls of Oran lying in the bight\r\nof a bay, sheltered by dominant hills.  The sun was shining brightly;\r\nduring our whole voyage we had not had so fine a day.  The wisdom\r\nwhich had led us to choose Oran as our place of observation seemed\r\ndemonstrated.  A rather excitable pilot came on board, and he guided\r\nus in behind the Mole, which had suffered much damage the previous\r\nyear from an unexplained outburst of waves from the Mediterranean.\r\nBoth port and bow anchors were cast in deep water.  With three huge\r\nhawsers the ship's stem was made fast to three gun-pillars fixed in\r\nthe Mole; and here for a time the \"Urgent\" rested from her labours.\r\n\r\nM. Janssen, who had rendered his name celebrated by his observations\r\nof the eclipse in India in 1868, when he showed the solar flames to be\r\neruptions of incandescent hydrogen, was already encamped in the open\r\ncountry about eight miles from Oran.  On December 2 he had quitted\r\nParis in a balloon, with a strong young sailor as his assistant, had\r\ndescended near the mouth of the Loire, seen M. Gambetta, and received\r\nfrom him encouragement and aid.  On the day of our arrival his\r\nencampment was visited by Mr. Huggins, and the kind and courteous\r\nEngineer of the Port drove me subsequently, in his own phaeton, to the\r\nplace.  It bore the best repute as regards freedom from haze and fog,\r\nand commanded an open outlook; but it was inconvenient for us on\r\naccount of its distance from the ship.  The place next in repute was\r\nthe railway station, between two and three miles distant from the\r\nMole.  It was inspected, but, being enclosed, was abandoned for an\r\neminence in an adjacent garden, the property of Mr. Hinshelwood, a\r\nScotchman who had settled some years previously as an Esparto merchant\r\nin Oran. [Footnote: Esparto is a kind of grass now much used in the\r\nmanufacture of paper.] He, in the most liberal manner, placed his\r\nground at the disposition of the party.  Here the tents were pitched,\r\non the Saturday, by Captain Salmond and his intelligent corps of\r\nsappers, the instruments being erected on the Monday under cover of\r\nthe tents.\r\n\r\nClose to the railway station runs a new loopholed wall of defence,\r\nthrough which the highway passes into the open country.  Standing on\r\nthe highway, and looking southwards, about twenty yards to the right\r\nis a small bastionet, intended to carry a gun or two.  Its roof I\r\nthought would form an admirable basis for my telescope, while the view\r\nof the surrounding country was unimpeded in all directions.  The\r\nauthorities kindly allowed me the use of this bastionet.  Two men, one\r\na blue-jacket named Elliot, and the other a marine named Hill, were\r\nplaced at my disposal by Lieutenant Walton; and, thus aided, on Monday\r\nmorning I mounted my telescope.  The instrument was new to me, and\r\nsome hours of discipline were spent in mastering all the details of\r\nits manipulation.\r\n\r\nMr. Huggins joined me, and we visited together the Arab quarter of\r\nOran.  The flat-roofed houses appeared very clean and white.  The\r\nstreet was filled with loiterers, and the thresholds were occupied by\r\npicturesque groups.  Some of the men were very fine.  We saw many\r\nstraight, manly fellows who must have been six feet four in height.\r\nThey passed us with perfect indifference, evincing no anger,\r\nsuspicion, or curiosity, hardly caring in fact to glance at us as we\r\npassed.  In one instance only during my stay at Oran was I spoken to\r\nby an Arab.  He was a tall, good-humoured fellow, who came smiling up\r\nto me, and muttered something about 'les Anglais.' The mixed\r\npopulation of Oran is picturesque in the highest degree: the Jews,\r\nrich and poor, varying in their costumes as their wealth varies; the\r\nArabs more picturesque still, and of all shades of complexion--the\r\nnegroes, the Spaniards, the French, all grouped together, each race\r\npreserving its own individuality, formed a picture intensely\r\ninteresting to me.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 20th, I was early at the bastionet.  The night had\r\nbeen very squally.  The sergeant of the sappers had taken charge of\r\nour key, and on Tuesday morning Elliot went for it.  He brought back\r\nthe intelligence that the tents had been blown down, and the\r\ninstruments overturned.  Among these was a large and valuable\r\nequatorial from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.  It seemed hardly\r\npossible that this instrument, with its wheels and verniers and\r\ndelicate adjustments, could have escaped uninjured from such a fall.\r\nThis, however, was the case; and during the day all the overturned\r\ninstruments were restored to their places, and found to be in\r\npractical working order.  This and the following day were devoted to\r\nincessant schooling.  I had come out as a general stargazer, and not\r\nwith the intention of devoting myself to the observation of any\r\nparticular phenomenon.  I wished to see the whole--the first contact,\r\nthe advance of the moon, the successive swallowing up of the solar\r\nspots, the breaking of the last line of crescent by the lunar\r\nmountains into Bailey's beads, the advance of the shadow through the\r\nair, the appearance of the corona and prominences at the moment of\r\ntotality, the radiant streamer; of the corona, the internal structure\r\nof the flames, a glance through a polariscope, a sweep round the\r\nlandscape with the naked eye, the reappearance of the soar limb\r\nthrough Bailey's beads, and, finally, the retreat of the lunar shadow\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\nI was provided with a telescope of admirable definition, mounted,\r\nadjusted, packed, and most liberally placed at my disposal by Mr.\r\nWarren De La Rue.  The telescope grasped the whole of the sun, and a\r\nconsiderable portion of the space surrounding it.  But it would not\r\ntake in the extreme limits of the corona.  For this I had lashed on to\r\nthe large telescope a light but powerful instrument, constructed by\r\nRoss, and lent to me by Mr. Huggins.  I was also furnished with an\r\nexcellent binocular by Mr. Dallmeyer.  In fact, no man could have been\r\nmore efficiently supported.\r\n\r\nIt required a strict parcelling out of the interval of totality to\r\nembrace in it the entire series of observations.  These, while the sun\r\nremained visible, were to be made with an unsilvered diagonal\r\neye-piece, which reflected but a small fraction of the sun's light,\r\nthis fraction, being still further toned down by a dark glass.  At the\r\nmoment of totality the dark glass was to be removed, and a silver\r\nreflector pushed in, so as to get the maximum of light from the corona\r\nand prominences The time of totality was distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n1.  Observe approach of shadow through the air: totality.\r\n\r\n2.  Telescope              30 seconds.\r\n\r\n3.  Finder                 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n4.  Double image prism     15 seconds.\r\n\r\n5.  Naked eye              10 seconds.\r\n\r\n6.  Finder or binocular    20 seconds.\r\n\r\n7.  Telescope              20 seconds.\r\n\r\n8.  Observe retreat of shadow.\r\n\r\nIn our rehearsals Elliot stood beside me, watch in hand, and\r\nfurnished with a lantern.  He called out at the end of each interval,\r\nwhile I moved from telescope to finder, from finder to polariscope,\r\nfrom polariscope to naked eye, from naked eye back to finder, from\r\nfinder to telescope, abandoning the instrument finally to observe the\r\nretreating shadow.  All this we went over twenty times, while looking\r\nat the actual sun, and keeping him in the middle of the field.  It was\r\nmy object to render the repetition of the lesson so mechanical as to\r\nleave no room for flurry, forgetfulness, or excitement.  Volition was\r\nnot to be called upon, nor judgment exercised, but a well-beaten path\r\nof routine was to be followed.  Had the opportunity occurred, I think\r\nthe programme would have been strictly carried out.\r\n\r\nBut the opportunity did not occur.  For several days the weather had\r\nbeen ill-natured.  We had wind so strong As to render the hawsers at\r\nthe stern of the \"Urgent\" as rigid as iron, and to destroy the\r\nnavigating lieutenant's sleep.  We had clouds, a thunder-storm, and\r\nsome rain.  Still the hope was held out that the atmosphere would\r\ncleanse itself, and if it did we were promised air of extraordinary\r\nlimpidity.  Early on the 22nd we were all at our posts.  Spaces of\r\nblue in the early morning gave us some encouragement, but all depended\r\non the relation of these spaces to the surrounding clouds. Which of\r\nthem were to grow as the day advanced?  The wind was high, and to\r\nsecure the steadiness of my instrument I was forced to retreat behind\r\na projection of the bastionet, place stones upon its stand, and,\r\nfurther, to avail myself of the shelter of a sail.  My practised men\r\nfastened the sail at the top, and loaded it with boulders at the\r\nbottom.  It was tried severely, but it stood firm.\r\n\r\nThe clouds and blue spaces fought for a time with varying success. The\r\nsun was bidden and revealed at intervals, hope oscillating in\r\nsynchronism with the changes of the sky.  At the moment of first\r\ncontact a dense cloud intervened; but a minute or two afterwards the\r\ncloud had passed, and the encroachment of the black body of the moon\r\nwas evident upon the solar disk.  The moon marched onward, and I saw\r\nit at frequent intervals; a large group of spots were approached and\r\nswallowed up.  Subsequently I caught sight of the lunar limb as it cut\r\nthrough the middle of a large spot.  The spot was not to be\r\ndistinguished from the moon, but rose like a mountain above it.  The\r\nclouds, when thin, could be seen as grey scud drifting across the\r\nblack surface of the moon; but they thickened more and more, and made\r\nthe intervals of clearness scantier.  During these moments I watched\r\nwith an interest bordering upon fascination the march of the silver\r\nsickle of the sun across the field of the telescope.  It was so sharp\r\nand so beautiful.  No trace of the lunar limb could be observed beyond\r\nthe sun's boundary.  Here, indeed, it could only be relieved by the\r\ncorona, which was utterly cut off by the dark glass.  The blackness of\r\nthe moon beyond the sun was, in fact, confounded with the blackness of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nBeside me was Elliot with the watch and lantern, while Lieutenant\r\nArcher, of the Royal Engineers, had the kindness to take charge of my\r\nnote-book.  I mentioned, and he wrote rapidly down, such things as\r\nseemed worthy of remembrance.  Thus my hands and mind were entirely\r\nfree; but it was all to no purpose.  A patch of sunlight fell and\r\nrested upon the landscape some miles away.  It was the only\r\nilluminated spot within view.  But to the north-west there was still a\r\nspace of blue which might reach us in time.  Within seven minutes of\r\ntotality another space towards the zenith became very dark.  The\r\natmosphere was, as it were, on the brink of a precipice, being charged\r\nwith humidity, which required but a slight chill to bring it down in\r\nclouds.  This was furnished by the withdrawal of the solar beams: the\r\nclouds did come down, covering up the space of blue on which our hopes\r\nhad so long rested.  I abandoned the telescope and walked to and fro\r\nin despair.  As the moment of totality approached, the descent towards\r\ndarkness was as obvious as a falling stone.  I looked towards a\r\ndistant ridge, where the darkness would first appear.  At the moment a\r\nfan of beams, issuing from the hidden sun, was spread out over the\r\nsouthern heavens.  These beams are bars of alternate light and shade,\r\nproduced in illuminated haze by the shadows of floating cloudlets of\r\nvarying density.  The beams are practically parallel, but by an effect\r\nof perspective they appear divergent, having the sun, in fact, for\r\ntheir point of convergence.  The darkness took possession of the ridge\r\nreferred to, lowered upon M. Janssen's observatory, passed over the\r\nsouthern heavens, blotting out the beams as if a sponge had been drawn\r\nacross them.  It then took successive possession of three spaces of\r\nblue sky in the south-eastern atmosphere.  I again looked towards the\r\nridge.  A glimmer as of day-dawn was behind it, and immediately\r\nafterwards the fan of beams, which had been for more than two minutes\r\nabsent, revived.  The eclipse of 1870 had ended, and, as far as the\r\ncorona and flames were concerned, we had been defeated.\r\n\r\nEven in the heart of the eclipse the darkness was by no means perfect.\r\nSmall print could be read.  In fact, the clouds which rendered the day\r\na dark one, by scattering light into the shadow, rendered the darkness\r\nless intense than it would have been had the atmosphere been without\r\ncloud.  In the more open spaces I sought for stars, but could find\r\nnone.  There was a lull in the wind before and after totality, but\r\nduring the totality the wind was strong.  I waited for some time on\r\nthe bastionet, hoping to get a glimpse of the moon on the opposite\r\nborder of the sun, but in vain.  The clouds continued, and some rain\r\nfell.  The day brightened somewhat afterwards, and, having packed all\r\nup, in the sober twilight Mr. Crookes and myself climbed the heights\r\nabove the fort of Vera Cruz.  From this eminence we had a very noble\r\nview over the Mediterranean and the flanking African hills.  The\r\nsunset was remarkable, and the whole outlook exceedingly fine.\r\n\r\nThe able and well-instructed medical officer of the \"Urgent,\" Mr.\r\nGoodman, observed the following temperatures during the progress of\r\nthe eclipse:\r\n\r\nHour         Deg.\r\n\r\n11.45        56\r\n\r\n11.55        55\r\n\r\n12.10        54\r\n\r\n12.37        53\r\n\r\n12.39        52\r\n\r\n12.43        51\r\n\r\n 1.5         52\r\n\r\n  1.27       53\r\n\r\n  1.44       56\r\n\r\n  2.10       57\r\n\r\nThe minimum temperature occurred some minutes after totality, when a\r\nslight rain fell.\r\n\r\nThe wind was so strong on the 23rd that Captain Henderson would not\r\nventure out.  Guided by Mr. Goodman, I visited a cave in a remarkable\r\nstratum of shell-breccia, and, thanks to my guide, secured specimens.\r\nMr. Busk informs me that a precisely similar breccia, is found at\r\nGibraltar, at approximately the same level.  During the afternoon,\r\nAdmiral Ommaney and myself drove to the fort of Marsa el Kibir.  The\r\nfortification is of ancient origin, the Moorish arches being still\r\nthere in decay, but the fort is now very strong.  About four or five\r\nhundred fine-looking dragoons were looking after their horses, waiting\r\nfor a lull to enable them to embark for France.  One of their officers\r\nwas wandering in a very solitary fashion over the fort.  We had some\r\nconversation with him.  He had been at Sedan, had been taken prisoner,\r\nbut had effected his escape.  He shook his head when we spoke of the\r\ntermination of the war, and predicted its long continuance.  There was\r\nbitterness in his tone as he spoke of the charges of treason so\r\nlightly levelled against French commanders.\r\n\r\nThe green waves raved round the promontory on which the fort stands,\r\nsmiting the rocks, breaking into foam, and jumping, after impact, to a\r\nheight of a hundred feet and more into the air.  As we returned our\r\nvehicle broke down through the loss of a wheel.  The Admiral went on\r\nboard, while I remained long watching the agitated sea.  The little\r\nhorses of Oran well merit a passing word.  Their speed and endurance,\r\nboth of which are heavily drawn upon by their drivers, are\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe wind sinking, we lifted anchor on the 24th.  For some hours we\r\nwent pleasantly along; but during the afternoon the storm revived, and\r\nit blew heavily against us all the night.  When we came opposite the\r\nBay of Almeria, on the 25th, the captain turned the ship, and steered\r\ninto the bay, where, under the shadow of the Sierra Nevada, we passed\r\nChristmas night in peace.  Next morning 'a rose of dawn' rested on the\r\nsnows of the adjacent mountains, while a purple haze was spread over\r\nthe lower hills.  I had no notion that Spain possessed so fine a range\r\nof mountains as the Sierra Nevada.  The height is considerable, but\r\nthe form also is such as to get the maximum of grandeur out of the\r\nheight.  We weighed anchor at eight A.M., passing for a time through\r\nshoal water, the bottom having been evidently stirred up.  The\r\nadjacent land seemed eroded in a remarkable manner.  It has its\r\nfloods, which excavate these valleys and ravines, and leave those\r\nsingular ridges behind.  Towards evening I climbed the mainmast, and,\r\nstanding on the cross-trees, saw the sun set amid a blaze of fiery\r\nclouds.  The wind was strong and bitterly cold, and I was glad to\r\nslide back to the deck along a rope, which stretched from the\r\nmast-head to the ship's side.  That night we cast anchor beside the\r\nMole of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 27th, in company with two friends, I drove to\r\nthe Spanish lines, with the view of seeing the rock from that side. It\r\nis an exceedingly noble mass.  The Peninsular and Oriental mail-boat\r\nhad been signalled and had come.  Heavy duties called me homeward, and\r\nby transferring myself from the \"Urgent\" to the mail-steamer I should\r\ngain three days.  I hired a boat, rowed to the steamer, learned that\r\nshe was to start at one, and returned with all speed to the \"Urgent.\"\r\nMaking known to Captain Henderson my wish to get away, he expressed\r\ndoubts as to the possibility of reaching the mail-steamer in time.\r\nWith his accustomed kindness, he however placed a boat at my disposal.\r\nFour hardy fellows and one of the ship's officers jumped into it; my\r\nluggage, hastily thrown together, was tumbled in, and we were\r\nimmediately on our way.  We had nearly four miles to row in about\r\ntwenty minutes; but we hoped the mail-boat might not be punctual.  For\r\na time we watched her anxiously; there was no motion; we came nearer,\r\nbut the flags were not yet hauled in.  The men put forth all their\r\nstrength, animated by the exhortations of the officer at the helm.\r\nThe roughness of the sea rendered their efforts to some extent\r\nnugatory: still we were rapidly approaching the steamer.  At length\r\nshe moved, punctual almost to the minute, at first slowly, but soon\r\nwith quickened pace.\r\n\r\nWe turned to the left, so as to cut across her bows.  Five minutes'\r\npull would have brought us up to her.  The officer waved his cap and I\r\nmy hat.  'If they could only see us, they might back to us in a\r\nmoment.' But they did not see us, or if they did, they paid us no\r\nattention.  I returned to the \"Urgent,\" discomfited, but grateful to\r\nthe fine fellows who had wrought so hard to carry out my wishes.\r\n\r\nGlad of the quiet, in the sober afternoon I took a walk towards Europa\r\nPoint.  The sky darkened and heavy squalls passed at intervals.\r\nPrivate theatricals were at the Convent, and the kind and courteous\r\nGovernor had sent cards to the eclipse party.  I failed in my duty in\r\nnot going.  St. Michael's Cave is said to rival, if it does not\r\noutrival, the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.  On the 28th Mr. Crookes, Mr.\r\nCarpenter, and myself, guided by a military policeman who understood\r\nhis work, explored the cavern.  The mouth is about 1,100 feet above\r\nthe sea.  We zigzagged up to it, and first were led into an aperture\r\nin the rock, at some height above the true entrance of the cave.  In\r\nthis upper cavern we saw some tall and beautiful stalactite pillars.\r\n\r\nThe water drips from the roof charged with bicarbonate of lime.\r\nExposed to the air, the carbonic acid partially escapes, and the\r\nsimple carbonate of lime, which is hardly at all soluble in water,\r\ndeposits itself as a solid, forming stalactites and stalagmites.  Even\r\nthe exposure of chalk or limestone water to the open air partially\r\nsoftens it.  A specimen of the Redbourne water exposed by Professors\r\nGraham, Miller, and Hofmann, in a shallow basin, fell from eighteen\r\ndegrees to nine degrees of hardness.  The softening process of Clark\r\nis virtually a hastening of the natural process.  Here, however,\r\ninstead of being permitted to evaporate, half the carbonic acid is\r\nappropriated by lime, the half thus taken up, as well as the remaining\r\nhalf, being precipitated.  The solid precipitate is permitted to sink,\r\nand the clear supernatant liquid is limpid soft water.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the real mouth of St. Michael's Cave, which is entered\r\nby a wicket.  The floor was somewhat muddy, and the roof and walls\r\nwere wet.  We soon found ourselves in the midst of a natural temple,\r\nwhere tall columns sprang complete from floor to roof, while incipient\r\ncolumns were growing to meet each other, upwards and downwards.  The\r\nwater which trickles from the stalactite, after having in part yielded\r\nup its carbonate of lime, falls upon the floor vertically underneath,\r\nand there builds the stalagmite.  Consequently, the pillars grow from\r\nabove and below simultaneously, along the same vertical.  It is easy\r\nto distinguish the stalagmitic from the stalactitic portion of the\r\npillars.  The former is always divided into short segments by\r\nprotuberant rings, as if deposited periodically, while the latter\r\npresents a uniform surface.  In some cases the points of inverted\r\ncones of stalactite rested on the centres of pillars of stalagmite.\r\nThe process of solidification and the consequent architecture were\r\nalike beautiful.\r\n\r\nWe followed our guide through various branches and arms of the cave,\r\nclimbed and descended steps, halted at the edges of dark shafts and\r\napertures, and squeezed ourselves through narrow passages.  From time\r\nto time we halted, while Mr. Crookes illuminated with ignited\r\nmagnesium wire, the roof, columns, dependent spears, and graceful\r\ndrapery of the stalactites.  Once, coming to a magnificent cluster of\r\nicicle-like spears, we helped ourselves to specimens.  There was some\r\ndifficulty in detaching the more delicate ones, their fragility was so\r\ngreat.  A consciousness of vandalism, which smote me at the time,\r\nhaunts me still; for, though our requisitions were moderate, this\r\nbeauty ought not to be at all invaded.  Pendent from the roof, in\r\ntheir natural habitat, nothing can exceed their delicate beauty; they\r\n_live_, as it were, surrounded by organic connections.  In London they\r\nare curious, but not beautiful.  Of gathered shells Emerson writes:\r\n\r\n   I wiped away the weeds and foam,\r\n   And brought my sea-born treasures home\r\n   But the poor, unsightly, noisome things\r\n   Had left their beauty on the shore,\r\n   With the sun, and the sand, and the wild uproar.\r\n\r\nThe promontory of Gibraltar is so burrowed with caverns that it has\r\nbeen called the Hill of Caves.  They are apparently related to the\r\ngeologic disturbances which the rock has undergone.  The earliest of\r\nthese is the tilting of the once horizontal strata.  Suppose a force\r\nof torsion to act upon the promontory at its southern extremity near\r\nEuropa Point, and suppose the rock to be of a partially yielding\r\ncharacter; such a force would twist the strata into screw-surfaces,\r\nthe greatest amount of twisting being endured near the point of\r\napplication of the force.  Such a twisting the rock appears to have\r\nsuffered; but instead of the twist fading gradually and uniformly off,\r\nin passing from south to north, the want of uniformity in the material\r\nhas produced lines of dislocation where there are abrupt changes in\r\nthe amount of twist. Thus, at the northern end of the rock the dip to\r\nthe west is nineteen degrees; in the Middle Hill, it is thirty-eight\r\ndegrees; in the centre of the South hill, or Sugar Loaf, it is\r\nfifty-seven degrees.  At the southern extremity of the Sugar Loaf\r\nstrata are vertical, while farther to the south they actually turn\r\nover and dip to the east.\r\n\r\nThe rock is thus divided into three sections, separated from each\r\nother by places of dislocation, where the strata are much wrenched and\r\nbroken.  These are called the Northern and Southern Quebrada, from the\r\nSpanish 'Tierra Quebrada,' or broken ground.  It is at these places\r\nthat the inland caves of Gibraltar are almost exclusively found. Based\r\non the observations of Dr. Falconer and himself, an excellent and most\r\ninteresting account of these 'caves, and of the human remains and\r\nworks of art which they contain, was communicated by Mr. Busk to the\r\nmeeting of the Congress of Prehistoric Archaeology at Norwich, and\r\nafterwards printed in the 'Transactions' of the Congress. [Footnote:\r\nIn this essay Mr. Busk refers to the previous labours of Mr. Smith, of\r\nJordan Hill, to whom we owe most of our knowledge of the geology of\r\nthe rock.]  Long subsequent to the operation of the twisting force\r\njust referred to, the promontory underwent various changes of level.\r\nThere are sea-terraces and layers of shell-breccia along its flanks,\r\nand numerous caves which, unlike the inland ones, are the product of\r\nmarine erosion.  The Ape's Hill, on the African side of the strait,\r\nMr. Busk informs me has undergone similar disturbances. [Footnote: No\r\none can rise from the perusal of Mr. Busk's paper without a feeling of\r\nadmiration for the principal discoverer and indefatigable explorer of\r\nthe Gibraltar caves, the late Captain Frederick Brome.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIn the harbour of Gibraltar, on the morning of our departure, I\r\nresumed a series of observations on the colour of the sea.  On the way\r\nout a number of specimens had been collected, with a view to\r\nsubsequent examination.  But the bottles were claret bottles, of\r\ndoubtful purity.  At Gibraltar, therefore, I purchased fifteen white\r\nglass bottles, with ground glass stoppers, and at Cadiz, thanks to the\r\nfriendly guidance of Mr. Cameron, I secured a dozen more.  These\r\nseven-and-twenty bottles were filled with water, taken at different\r\nplaces between Oran and Spithead.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me express my warmest acknowledgments to Captain\r\nHenderson, the commander of H.M.S. \"Urgent,\" who aided me in my\r\nobservations in every possible way.  Indeed, my thanks are due to all\r\nthe officers for their unfailing courtesy and help.  The captain\r\nplaced at my disposal his own coxswain, an intelligent fellow named\r\nThorogood, who skilfully attached a cord to each bottle, weighted it\r\nwith lead, cast it into the sea, and, after three successive rinsings,\r\nfilled it under my own eyes.  The contact of jugs, buckets, or other\r\nvessels was thus avoided; and even the necessity of pouring out the\r\nwater, afterwards, through the dirty London air.\r\n\r\nThe mode of examination applied to these bottles has been already\r\ndescribed. [Footnote: On Dust and Disease, p. 168.]  The liquid is\r\nilluminated by a powerfully condensed beam, its condition being\r\nrevealed through the light scattered by its suspended particles. 'Care\r\nis taken to defend the eye from the access of all other light, and,\r\nthus defended, it becomes an organ of inconceivable delicacy.' Were\r\nwater of uniform density perfectly free from suspended matter, it\r\nwould, in my opinion, scatter no light at all.  The track of a\r\nluminous beam could not be seen in such water.  But 'an amount of\r\nimpurity so infinitesimal as to be scarcely expressible in numbers,\r\nand the individual particles of which are so small as wholly to elude\r\nthe microscope, may, when examined by the method alluded to, produce\r\nnot only sensible, but striking, effects upon the eye.'\r\n\r\nThe results of the examination of nineteen bottles filled at various\r\nplaces between Gibraltar and Spithead, are here tabulated:\r\n\r\nNo.  Locality            Colour of Sea     Appearance in Luminous beam\r\n\r\n1    Gibraltar Harbour      Green           Thick with fine particles\r\n\r\n2    Two miles              Clearer green   Thick with very\r\n     from Gibraltar                         fine particles\r\n\r\n3    Off Cabreta Point      Bright green     Still thick, but less so\r\n\r\n4    Off Cabreta Point      Black-indigo     Much less thick, very pure\r\n\r\n5    Off Tarifa             Undecided        Thicker than No. 4\r\n\r\n6    Beyond Tarifa          Cobalt-blue      Much purer than No. 5\r\n\r\n7    Twelve miles           Yellow-green           Very thick\r\n     from Cadiz\r\n\r\n8    Cadiz Harbour          Yellow-green     Exceedingly thick\r\n\r\n9    Fourteen miles         Yellow-green     Thick, but less so\r\n      from Cadiz\r\n\r\n10   Fourteen miles         Bright green     Much less thick\r\n      from Cadiz\r\n\r\n11   Between Capes          Deep Indigo      Very little matter,\r\n     St. Mary and Vincent                    very pure\r\n\r\n12   Off the Burlings.

The home examination\r\nshowed the first to be thick with suspended matter, the second less\r\nthick, and the third still less thick.  Thus the green brightened as\r\nthe suspended matter diminished in amount.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the fourth observation our excellent navigating\r\nlieutenant, Mr. Brown, steered along the coast, thus avoiding the\r\nadverse current which sets in, through the Strait, from the Atlantic\r\nto the Mediterranean.  He was at length forced to cross the boundary\r\nof the Atlantic current, which was defined with extraordinary\r\nsharpness.  On the one side of it the water was a vivid green, on the\r\nother a deep blue.  Standing at the bow of the ship, a bottle could be\r\nfilled with blue water, while at the same moment a bottle cast from\r\nthe stern could be filled with green water.  Two bottles were secured,\r\none on each side of this remarkable boundary.  In the distance the\r\nAtlantic had the hue called ultra-marine; but looked fairly down upon,\r\nit was of almost inky blackness--black qualified by a trace of\r\nindigo.\r\n\r\nWhat change does the home examination here reveal?  In passing to\r\nindigo, the water becomes suddenly augmented in purity, the suspended\r\nmatter becoming suddenly less.  Off Tarifa, the deep indigo\r\ndisappears, and the sea is undecided in colour.  Accompanying this\r\nchange, we have a rise in the quantity of suspended matter.  Beyond\r\nTarifa, we change to cobalt-blue, the suspended matter falling at the\r\nsame time in quantity.  This water is distinctly purer than the green.\r\nWe approach Cadiz, and at twelve miles from the city get into\r\nyellow-green water; this the London examination shows to be thick with\r\nsuspended matter.  The same is true of Cadiz harbour, and also of a\r\npoint fourteen miles from Cadiz in the homeward direction.  Here there\r\nis a sudden change from yellow-green to a bright emerald-green, and\r\naccompanying the change a sudden fall in the quantity of suspended\r\nmatter.  Between Cape St. Mary and Cape St: Vincent the water changes\r\nto the deepest indigo, a further diminution of the suspended matter\r\nbeing the concomitant phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the remarkable group of rocks called the Burlings, and\r\nfind the water between the shore and the rocks a strong green; the\r\nhome examination shows it to be thick with fine matter.  Fifteen or\r\ntwenty miles beyond the Burlings we come again into indigo water, from\r\nwhich the suspended matter has in great part disappeared.  Off Cape\r\nFinisterre, about the place where the 'Captain' went down, the water\r\nbecomes green, and the home examination pronounces it to be thicker.\r\nThen we enter the Bay of Biscay, where the indigo resumes its power,\r\nand where the home examination shows the greatly augmented purity of\r\nthe water.  A second specimen of water, taken from the Bay of Biscay,\r\nheld in suspension fine particles of a peculiar kind; the size of them\r\nwas such as to render the water richly iridescent.  It showed itself\r\ngreen, blue, or salmon-coloured, according to the direction of the\r\nline of vision.  Finally, we come to our last two bottles, the one\r\ntaken opposite St. Catherine's lighthouse, in the Isle of Wight, the\r\nother at Spithead.  The sea at both these places was green, and both\r\nspecimens, as might be expected, were pronounced by the home\r\nexamination to be thick with suspended matter.\r\n\r\nTwo distinct series of observations are here referred to--the one\r\nconsisting of direct observations of the colour of the sea, conducted\r\nduring the voyage from Gibraltar to Portsmouth: the other carried out\r\nin the laboratory of the Royal Institution.  And here it is to be\r\nnoted that in the home examination I never knew what water was placed\r\nin my hands.  The labels, with the names of the localities written\r\nupon them, had been tied up, all information regarding the source of\r\nthe water being thus held back.  The bottles were simply numbered, and\r\nnot till all of them had been examined, and described, were the labels\r\nopened, and the locality and sea-colour corresponding to the various\r\nspecimens ascertained.  The home observations, therefore, must have\r\nbeen perfectly unbiassed, and they clearly establish the association\r\nof the green colour with fine suspended matter, and of the ultramarine\r\ncolour, and more especially of the black-indigo hue of the Atlantic,\r\nwith the comparative absence of such matter.\r\n\r\nSo much for mere observation; but what is the cause of the dark hue of\r\nthe deep ocean? [Footnote: A note, written to me on October 22, by my\r\nfriend Canon Kingsley, contains the following reference to this point:\r\n'I have never seen the Lake of Geneva, but I thought of the brilliant\r\ndazzling dark blue of the mid-Atlantic under the sunlight, and its\r\nblack-blue under cloud, both so solid that one might leap off the\r\nsponson on to it without fear; this was to me the most wonderful thing\r\nwhich I saw on my voyages to and from the West Indies.']\r\n\r\nA preliminary remark or two will clear our way towards an explanation.\r\nColour resides in white light, appearing when any constituent of the\r\nwhite light is withdrawn.  The hue of a purple liquid, for example, is\r\nimmediately accounted for by its action on a spectrum.  It cuts out\r\nthe yellow and green, and allows the red and blue to pass through. The\r\nblending of these two colours produces the purple.  But while such a\r\nliquid attacks with special energy the yellow and green, it enfeebles\r\nthe whole spectrum.  By increasing the thickness of the stratum we may\r\nabsorb the whole of the light.  The colour of a blue liquid is\r\nsimilarly accounted for.  It first extinguishes the red; then, as the\r\nthickness augments, it attacks the orange, yellow, and green in\r\nsuccession; the blue alone finally remaining.  But even it might be\r\nextinguished by a sufficient depth of 'the liquid.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are prepared for a brief, but tolerably complete, statement\r\nof that action of sea-water upon light, to which it owes its darkness.\r\nThe spectrum embraces three classes of rays--the thermal, the visual,\r\nand the chemical.  These divisions overlap each other; the thermal\r\nrays are in part visual, the visual rays in part chemical, and vice\r\nversa.  The vast body of thermal rays lie beyond the red, being\r\ninvisible.  These rays are attacked with exceeding energy by water.\r\nThey are absorbed close to the surface of the sea, and are the great\r\nagents in evaporation.  At the same time the whole spectrum suffers\r\nenfeeblement; water attacks all its rays, but with different degrees\r\nof energy.  Of the visual rays, the red are first extinguished.  As\r\nthe solar beam plunges deeper into the sea, orange follows red, yellow\r\nfollows orange, green follows yellow, and the various shades of blue,\r\nwhere the water is deep enough, follow green.  Absolute extinction of\r\nthe solar beam would be the consequence if the water were deep and\r\nuniform.  If it contained no suspended matter, such water would be as\r\nblack as ink.  A reflected glimmer of ordinary light would reach us\r\nfrom its surface, as it would from the surface of actual ink; but no\r\nlight, hence no colour, would reach us from the body of the water.\r\n\r\nIn very clear and deep sea-water this condition is approximately\r\nfulfilled, and hence the extraordinary darkness of such water.  The\r\nindigo, already referred to, is, I believe, to be ascribed in part to\r\nthe suspended matter, which is never absent, even in the purest\r\nnatural water; and in part to the slight reflection of the light from\r\nthe limiting surfaces of strata of different densities.  A modicum of\r\nlight is thus thrown back to the eye, before the depth necessary to\r\nabsolute extinction has been attained.  An effect precisely similar\r\noccurs under the moraines of glaciers.  The ice here is exceptionally\r\ncompact, and, owing to the absence of the internal scattering common\r\nin bubbled ice, the light plunges into the mass, where it is\r\nextinguished, the perfectly clear ice presenting an appearance of\r\npitchy blackness. [Footnote: I learn from a correspondent that certain\r\nWelsh tarns, which are reputed bottomless, have this inky hue.]\r\n\r\nThe green colour of the sea has now to be accounted for; and here,\r\nagain, let us fall back upon the sure basis of experiment.  A strong\r\nwhite dinner-plate had a lead weight securely fastened to it.  Fifty\r\nor sixty yards of strong hempen line were attached to the plate.\r\n\r\nMy assistant, Thorogood, occupied a boat, fastened as usual to the\r\ndavits of the \"Urgent,\" while I occupied a second boat nearer the\r\nstern of the ship.  He cast the plate as a mariner heaves the lead,\r\nand by the time it reached me it had sunk a considerable depth in the\r\nwater.  In all cases the hue of this plate was green.  Even when the\r\nsea was of the darkest indigo, the green, was vivid and pronounced.  I\r\ncould notice the gradual deepening of the colour as the plate sank,\r\nbut at its greatest depth, even in indigo water, the colour was still\r\na blue-green. [Footnote: In no case, of course, is the green pure, but\r\na mixture of green and blue.]\r\n\r\nOther observations confirmed this one.  The \"Urgent\" is a screw\r\nsteamer, and right over the blades of the screw was an orifice called\r\nthe screw-well, through which one could look from the poop down upon\r\nthe screw.  The surface-glimmer, which so pesters the eye, was here in\r\na great measure removed.  Midway down, a plank crossed the screw-well\r\nfrom side to side; on this I placed myself and observed the action of\r\nthe screw underneath.  The eye was rendered sensitive by the\r\nmoderation of the light; and, to remove still further all disturbing\r\ncauses, Lieutenant Walton had a sail and tarpaulin thrown over the\r\nmouth of the well.  Underneath this I perched myself on the plank and\r\nwatched the screw.  In an indigo sea the play of colour was\r\nindescribably beautiful, and the contrast between the water, which had\r\nthe screw-blades, and that which had the bottom of the ocean, as a\r\nbackground, was extraordinary.  The one was of the most brilliant\r\ngreen, the other of the deepest ultramarine.  The surface of the water\r\nabove the screw-blade was always ruffled.  Liquid lenses were thus\r\nformed, by which the coloured light was withdrawn from some places and\r\nconcentrated upon others, the water flashing with metallic lustre. The\r\nscrew-blades in this case played the part of the dinner-plate in the\r\nformer case, and there were other instances of a similar kind. The\r\nwhite bellies of porpoises showed the green hue, varying in intensity\r\nas the creatures swung to and fro between the surface and the deeper\r\nwater.  Foam, at a certain depth below the surface, was also green.\r\nIn a rough sea the light which penetrated the summit of a wave\r\nsometimes reached the eye, a beautiful green cap being thus placed\r\nupon the wave, even in indigo water.\r\n\r\nBut how is this colour to be connected with the suspended particles?\r\nThus.  Take the dinner-plate which showed so brilliant a green when\r\nthrown into indigo water.  Suppose it to diminish in size, until it\r\nreaches an almost microscopic magnitude.  It would still behave\r\nsubstantially as the larger plate, sending to the eye its modicum of\r\ngreen light.  If the plate, instead of being a large coherent mass,\r\nwere ground to a powder sufficiently fine, and in this condition\r\ndiffused through the clear sea-water, it would also send green light\r\nto the eye.  In fact, the suspended particles which the home\r\nexamination reveals, act in all essential particulars like the plate,\r\nor like the screw-blades, or like the foam, or like the bellies of the\r\nporpoises.  Thus I think the greenness of the sea is physically\r\nconnected with the matter which it holds in suspension.\r\n\r\nWe reached Portsmouth on January 5, 1871.  Then ended a voyage which,\r\nthough its main object was not realised, has left behind it pleasant\r\nmemories, both of the aspects of nature and the kindliness of men.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nVII. NIAGARA.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A Discourse delivered at the Royal Institution of Great\r\nBritain, April 4, 1873.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the disadvantages of reading books about natural scenery\r\nthat they fill the mind with pictures, often exaggerated, often\r\ndistorted, often blurred, and, even when well drawn, injurious to the\r\nfreshness of first impressions.  Such has been the fate of most of us\r\nwith regard to the Falls of Niagara.  There was little accuracy in the\r\nestimates of the first observers of the cataract.  Startled by an\r\nexhibition of power so novel and so grand, emotion leaped beyond the\r\ncontrol of the judgment, and gave currency to notions which have often\r\nled to disappointment.\r\n\r\nA record of a voyage in 1535 by a French mariner named Jacques\r\nCartier, contains, it is said, the first printed allusion to Niagara.\r\nIn 1603 the first map of the district was constructed by a Frenchman\r\nnamed Champlain.  In 1648 the Jesuit Rageneau, in a letter to his\r\nsuperior at Paris, mentions Niagara as 'a cataract of frightful\r\nheight.' [Footnote: From an interesting little book presented to me at\r\nBrooklyn by its author, Mr. Holly, some of these data are derived:\r\nHennepin, Kalm, Bakewell, Lyell, Hall, and others I have myself\r\nconsulted.]  In the winter of 1678 and 1679 the cataract was visited\r\nby Father Hennepin, and described in a book dedicated 'to the King of\r\nGreat Britain.' He gives a drawing of the waterfall, which shows that\r\nserious changes have taken place since his time.  He describes it as\r\n'a great and prodigious cadence of water, to which the universe does\r\nnot offer a parallel.' The height of the fall, according to Hennepin,\r\nwas more than 600 feet.  'The waters,' he says, 'which fall from this\r\ngreat precipice do foam and boil in the most astonishing manner,\r\nmaking a noise more terrible than that of thunder.  When the wind\r\nblows to the south its frightful roaring may be heard for more than\r\nfifteen leagues.' The Baron la Hontan, who visited Niagara in 1687,\r\nmakes the height 800 feet.  In 1721 Charlevois, in a letter to Madame\r\nde Maintenon, after referring to the exaggerations of his\r\npredecessors, thus states the result of his own observations: 'For my\r\npart, after examining it on all sides, I am inclined to think that we\r\ncannot allow it less than 140 or 150 feet,'--a remarkably close\r\nestimate.  At that time, viz.  a hundred and fifty years ago, it had\r\nthe shape of a horseshoe, and reasons will subsequently be given for\r\nholding that this has been always the form of the cataract, from its\r\norigin to its present site.\r\n\r\nAs regards the noise of the fall, Charlevois declares the accounts of\r\nhis predecessors, which, I may say, are repeated to the present hour,\r\nto be altogether extravagant.  He is perfectly right.  The thunders of\r\nNiagara are formidable enough to those who really seek them at the\r\nbase of the Horseshoe Fall; but on the banks of the river, and\r\nparticularly above the fall, its silence, rather than its noise, is\r\nsurprising.  This arises, in part, from the lack of resonance; the\r\nsurrounding country being flat, and therefore furnishing no echoing\r\nsurfaces to reinforce the shock of the water.  The resonance from the\r\nsurrounding rocks causes the Swiss Reuss at the Devil's Bridge, when\r\nfull, to thunder more loudly than the Niagara.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, November 1, 1872, just before reaching the village of\r\nNiagara Falls, I caught, from the railway train, my first glimpse of\r\nthe smoke of the cataract.  Immediately after my arrival I went with a\r\nfriend to the northern end of the American Fall.  It may be that my\r\nmood at the time toned down the impression produced by the first\r\naspect of this grand cascade; but I felt nothing like disappointment,\r\nknowing, from old experience, that time and close acquaintanceship,\r\nthe gradual interweaving of mind and nature, must powerfully influence\r\nmy final estimate of the scene.  After dinner we crossed to Goat\r\nIsland, and, turning to the right, reached the southern end of the\r\nAmerican Fall.  The river is here studded with small islands. Crossing\r\na wooden bridge to Luna Island, and clasping a tree which grows near\r\nits edge, I looked long at the cataract, which here shoots down the\r\nprecipice like an avalanche of foam.  It grew in power and beauty.\r\nThe channel spanned by the wooden bridge was deep, and the river there\r\ndoubled over the edge of the precipice, like the swell of a muscle,\r\nunbroken.  The ledge here overhangs, the water being poured out far\r\nbeyond the base of the precipice.  A space, called the Cave of the\r\nWinds, is thus enclosed between the wall of rock and the falling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nGoat Island ends in a sheer dry precipice, which connects the American\r\nand Horseshoe Falls.  Midway between both is a wooden hut, the\r\nresidence of the guide to the Cave of the Winds, and from the hut a\r\nwinding staircase, called Biddle's Stair, descends to the base of the\r\nprecipice.  On the evening of my arrival I went down this stair, and\r\nwandered along the bottom of the cliff.  One well-known factor in the\r\nformation and retreat of the cataract was immediately observed.  A\r\nthick layer of limestone formed the upper portion of the cliff.  This\r\nrested upon a bed of soft shale, which extended round the base of the\r\ncataract.  The violent recoil of the water against this yielding\r\nsubstance crumbles it away, undermining the ledge above, which,\r\nunsupported, eventually breaks off, and produces the observed\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\nAt the southern extremity of the Horseshoe is a promontory, formed by\r\nthe doubling back of the gorge excavated by the cataract, and into\r\nwhich it plunges.  On the promontory stands a stone building, called\r\nthe Terrapin Tower, the door of which had been nailed up because of\r\nthe decay of the staircase within it.  Through the kindness of Mr.\r\nTownsend, the superintendent of Goat Island, the door was opened for\r\nme.  From this tower, at all hours of the day, and at some hours of\r\nthe night, I watched and listened to the Horseshoe Fall.  The river\r\nhere is evidently much deeper than the American branch; and instead of\r\nbursting into foam where it quits the ledge, it bends solidly over,\r\nand falls in a continuous layer of the most vivid green.  The tint is\r\nnot uniform; long stripes of deeper hue alternating with bands of\r\nbrighter colour.  Close to the ledge over which the water rolls, foam\r\nis generated, the light falling upon which, and flashing back from it,\r\nis sifted in its passage to and fro, and changed from white to\r\nemerald-green.  Heaps of superficial foam are also formed at intervals\r\nalong the ledge, and are immediately drawn into long white striae.\r\n[Footnote: The direction of the wind with reference to the course of a\r\nship may be inferred with accuracy from the foam-streaks on the\r\nsurface of the sea.]  Lower down, the surface, shaken by the reaction\r\nfrom below, incessantly rustles into whiteness.  The descent finally\r\nresolves itself into a rhythm, the water reaching the bottom of the\r\nfall in periodic gushes.  Nor is the spray uniformly diffused through\r\nthe air, but is wafted through it in successive veils of gauze-like\r\ntexture.  From all this it is evident that beauty is not absent from\r\nthe Horseshoe Fall, but majesty is its chief attribute.  The plunge of\r\nthe water is not wild, but deliberate, vast, and fascinating.  From\r\nthe Terrapin Tower, the adjacent arm of the Horseshoe is seen\r\nprojected against the opposite one, midway down; to the imagination,\r\ntherefore, is left the picturing of the gulf into which the cataract\r\nplunges.\r\n\r\nThe delight which natural scenery produces in some minds is difficult\r\nto explain, and the conduct which it prompts can hardly be fairly\r\ncriticised by those who have never experienced it.  It seems to me a\r\ndeduction from the completeness of the celebrated Thomas Young, that\r\nhe was unable to appreciate natural scenery.  'He had really,' says\r\nDean Peacock, 'no taste for life in the country; he was one of those\r\nwho thought that no one who was able to live in London would be\r\ncontent to 'live elsewhere.' Well, Dr. Young, like Dr. Johnson, had a\r\nright to his delights; but I can understand a hesitation to accept\r\nthem, high as they were, to the exclusion of\r\n\r\n    That o'erflowing joy which Nature yields\r\n    To her true lovers.\r\n\r\nTo all who are of this mind, the strengthening of desire on my part to\r\nsee and know Niagara Falls, as far as it is possible for them to be\r\nseen and known, will be intelligible.\r\n\r\nOn the first evening of my visit, I met, at the head of Biddle's\r\nStair, the guide to the Cave of the Winds.  He was in the prime of\r\nmanhood--large, well built, firm and pleasant in mouth and eye.  My\r\ninterest in the scene stirred up his, and made him communicative.\r\n\r\nTurning to a photograph, he described, by reference to it, a feat\r\nwhich he had accomplished some time previously, and which had brought\r\nhim almost under the green water of the Horseshoe Fall.  'Can you lead\r\nme there to-morrow?' I asked.  He eyed me enquiringly, weighing,\r\nperhaps, the chances of a man of light build, and with grey in his\r\nwhiskers, in such an undertaking.  'I wish,' I added, 'to see as much\r\nof the fall as can be seen, and where you lead I will endeavour to\r\nfollow.' His scrutiny relaxed into a smile, and he said, 'Very well;\r\nI shall be ready for you to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, accordingly, I came.  In the hut at the head of\r\nBiddle's Stair I stripped wholly, and re-dressed according to\r\ninstructions,--drawing on two pairs of woollen pantaloons, three\r\nwoollen jackets, two pairs of socks, and a pair of felt shoes.  Even\r\nif wet, my guide assured me that the clothes would keep me from being\r\nchilled; and he was right.  A suit and hood of yellow oilcloth covered\r\nall.  Most laudable precautions were taken by the young assistant who\r\nhelped to dress me to keep the water out; but his devices broke down\r\nimmediately when severely tested.\r\n\r\nWe descended the stair; the handle of a pitchfork doing, in my case,\r\nthe duty of an alpenstock.  At the bottom, the guide enquired whether\r\nwe should go first to the Cave of the Winds, or to the Horseshoe,\r\nremarking that the latter would try us most. I decided on getting the\r\nroughest done first, and he turned to the left over the stones.  They\r\nwere sharp and trying.  The base of the first portion of the cataract\r\nis covered with huge boulders, obviously the ruins of the limestone\r\nledge above.  The water does not distribute itself uniformly among\r\nthese, but seeks out channels through which it pours torrentially.  We\r\npassed some of these with wetted feet, but without difficulty.  At\r\nlength we came to the side of a more formidable current.  My guide\r\nwalked along its edge until he reached its least turbulent portion.\r\nHalting, he said, 'This is our greatest difficulty; if we can cross\r\nhere, we shall get far towards the Horseshoe.'\r\n\r\nHe waded in.  It evidently required all his strength to steady him.\r\nThe water rose above his loins, and it foamed still higher.  He had to\r\nsearch for footing, amid unseen boulders, against which the torrent\r\nrose violently.  He struggled and swayed, but he struggled\r\nsuccessfully, and finally reached the shallower water at the other\r\nside.  Stretching out his arm, he said to me, 'Now come on.' I looked\r\ndown the torrent, as it' rushed to the river below, which was seething\r\nwith the tumult of the cataract.  De Saussure recommended the\r\ninspection of Alpine dangers, with the view of making them familiar to\r\nthe eye before they are encountered; and it is a wholesome custom in\r\nplaces of difficulty to put the possibility of an accident clearly\r\nbefore the mind, and to decide beforehand what ought to be done should\r\nthe accident occur.  Thus wound up in the present instance, I entered\r\nthe water.  Even where it was not more than knee-deep, its power was\r\nmanifest. As it rose around me, I sought to split the torrent by\r\npresenting a side to it; but the insecurity of the footing enabled it\r\nto grasp my loins, twist me fairly round, and bring its impetus to\r\nbear upon my back.  Further struggle was impossible; and feeling my\r\nbalance hopelessly gone, I turned, flung myself towards the bank just\r\nquitted, and was instantly, as expected, swept into shallower water.\r\n\r\nThe oilcloth covering was a great incumbrance; it had been made for a\r\nmuch stouter man, and, standing upright after my submersion, my legs\r\noccupied the centre of two bags of water.  My guide exhorted me to try\r\nagain.  Prudence was at my elbow, whispering dissuasion; but, taking\r\neverything into account, it appeared more immoral to retreat than to\r\nproceed.  Instructed by the first misadventure, I once more entered\r\nthe stream.  Had the alpenstock been of iron it might have helped me;\r\nbut, as it was, the tendency of the water to sweep it out of my hands\r\nrendered it worse than useless.  I, however, clung to it by habit.\r\nAgain the torrent rose, and again I wavered; but, by keeping the left\r\nhip well against it, I remained upright, and at length grasped the\r\nhand of my leader at the other side.  He laughed pleasantly.  The\r\nfirst victory was gained, and he enjoyed it.  'No traveller,' he said,\r\n'was ever here before.'  Soon afterwards, by trusting to a piece of\r\ndrift-wood which seemed firm, I was again taken off my feet, but was\r\nimmediately caught by a protruding rock.\r\n\r\nWe clambered over the boulders towards the thickest spray, which soon\r\nbecame so weighty as to cause us to stagger under its shock.  For the\r\nmost part nothing could be seen; we were in the midst of bewildering\r\ntumult, lashed by the water, which sounded at times like the cracking\r\nof innumerable whips.  Underneath this was the deep resonant roar of\r\nthe cataract.  I tried to shield my eyes with my hands, and look\r\nupwards; but the defence was useless.  The guide continued to move on,\r\nbut at a certain place he halted, desiring me to take shelter in his\r\nlee, and observe the cataract.  The spray did not come so much from\r\nthe upper ledge, as from the rebound of the shattered water when it\r\nstruck the bottom.  Hence the eyes could be protected from the\r\nblinding shock of the spray, while the line of vision to the upper\r\nledges remained to some extent clear.  On looking upwards over the\r\nguide's shoulder I could see the water bending over the ledge, while\r\nthe Terrapin Tower loomed fitfully through the intermittent\r\nspray-gusts.  We were right under the tower.  A little farther on the\r\ncataract, after its first plunge, hit a protuberance some way down,\r\nand flew from it in a prodigious burst of spray; through this we\r\nstaggered.  We rounded the promontory on which the Terrapin Tower\r\nstands, and moved, amid the wildest commotion, along the arm of the\r\nHorse-hoe, until the boulders failed us, and the cataract fell into\r\nthe profound gorge of the Niagara River.\r\n\r\nHere the guide sheltered me again, and desired me to look up; I did\r\nso, and could see, as before, the green gleam of the mighty curve\r\nsweeping over the uipper ledge, and the fitful plunge of the water, as\r\nthe spray between us and it alternately gathered and disappeared. An\r\neminent friend of mine often speaks of the mistake of those physicians\r\nwho regard man's ailments as purely chemical, to be met by chemical\r\nremedies only.  He contends for the psychological element of cure.  By\r\nagreeable emotions, he says, nervous currents are liberated which\r\nstimulate blood, brain, and viscera.  The influence rained from\r\nladies' eyes enables my friend to thrive on dishes which would kill\r\nhim if eaten alone.  A sanative effect of the same order I experienced\r\namid the spray and thunder of Niagara.  Quickened by the emotions\r\nthere aroused, the blood sped exultingly through the arteries,\r\nabolishing introspection, clearing the heart of all bitterness, and\r\nenabling one to think with tolerance, if not with tenderness, on the\r\nmost relentless and unreasonable foe.  Apart from its scientific\r\nvalue, and purely as a moral agent, the play was worth the candle.  My\r\ncompanion knew no more of me than that I enjoyed the wildness of the\r\nscene; but as I bent in the shelter of his large frame he said, 'I\r\nshould like to see you attempting to describe all this.' He rightly\r\nthought it indescribable.  The name of this gallant fellow was Thomas\r\nConroy.\r\n\r\nWe returned, clambering at intervals up and down, so as to catch\r\nglimpses of the most impressive portions of the cataract.  We passed\r\nunder ledges formed by tabular masses of limestone, and through some\r\ncurious openings formed by the falling together of the summits of the\r\nrocks.  At length we found ourselves beside our enemy of the morning.\r\nConroy halted for a minute or two, scanning the torrent thoughtfully.\r\nI said that, as a guide, he ought to have a rope in such a place; but\r\nhe retorted that, as no traveller had ever thought of coming there, he\r\ndid not see the necessity of keeping a rope.  He waded in.  The\r\nstruggle to keep himself erect was evident enough; he swayed, but\r\nrecovered himself again and again.  At length he slipped, gave way,\r\ndid as I had done, threw himself towards the bank, and was swept into\r\nthe shallows.  Standing in the stream near its edge, he stretched his\r\narm towards me.  I retained the pitchfork handle, for it had been\r\nuseful among the boulders.  By wading some way in, the staff could be\r\nmade to reach him, and I proposed his seizing it.  'If you are sure,'\r\nhe replied, 'that, in case of giving way, you can maintain your grasp,\r\nthen I will certainly hold you.'  Remarking that he might count on\r\nthis, I waded in, and stretched the staff to my companion.  It was\r\nfirmly grasped by both of us.  Thus helped, though its onset was\r\nstrong, I moved safely across the torrent.  All danger ended here.  We\r\nafterwards roamed sociably among the torrents and boulders below the\r\nCave of the Winds.  The rocks were covered with organic slime, which\r\ncould not have been walked over with bare feet, but the felt shoes\r\neffectually prevented slipping.  We reached the cave and entered it,\r\nfirst by a wooden way carried over the boulders, and then along a\r\nnarrow ledge, to the point eaten deepest into the shale.  When the\r\nwind is from the south, the falling water, I am told, can be seen\r\ntranquilly from this spot; but when we were there, a blinding\r\nhurricane of spray was whirled against us.  On the evening of the same\r\nday, I went behind the water on the Canada side, which, after the\r\nexperiences of the morning, struck me as an imposture.\r\n\r\nStill even this latter is exciting to some nerves.  Its effect upon\r\nhimself is thus vividly described by Bakewell, jun: 'On turning a\r\nsharp angle of the rock, a sudden gust of wind met us, coming from\r\nthe hollow between the fall and the rock, which drove the spray\r\ndirectly in our faces, with such force that in an instant we were wet\r\nthrough.  When in the midst of this shower-bath the shock took away my\r\nbreath: I turned back and scrambled over the loose stones to escape\r\nthe conflict.  The guide soon followed, and told me that I had passed\r\nthe worst part.  With that assurance I made a second attempt; but so\r\nwild and disordered was my imagination that when I had reached half\r\nway I could bear it no longer.' [Footnote: 'Mag. of Nat. Hist,' 1830,\r\npp. 121, 122.]\r\n\r\nTo complete my knowledge I desired to see the fall from the river\r\nbelow it, and long negotiations were necessary to secure the means of\r\ndoing so.  The only boat fit for the undertaking had been laid up for\r\nthe winter; but this difficulty, through the kind intervention of Mr.\r\nTownsend, was overcome.  The main one was to secure oarsmen\r\nsufficiently strong and skilful to urge the boat where I wished it to\r\nbe taken.  The son of the owner of the boat, a finely-built young\r\nfellow, but only twenty, and therefore not sufficiently hardened, was\r\nwilling to go; and up the river, it was stated, there lived another\r\nman who could do anything with the boat which strength and daring\r\ncould accomplish.  He came.  His figure and expression of face\r\ncertainly indicated extraordinary firmness and power.  On Tuesday,\r\nNovember 5, we started, each of us being clad in oilcloth.  The elder\r\noarsman at once assumed a tone of authority over his companion, and\r\nstruck immediately in amid the breakers below the American Fall.  He\r\nhugged the cross freshets instead of striking out into the smoother\r\nwater.  I asked him why he did so, and he replied that they were\r\ndirected outwards, not downwards.  The struggle, however, to prevent\r\nthe bow of the boat from being turned by them, was often very severe.\r\n\r\nThe spray was in general blinding, but at times it disappeared and\r\nyielded noble views of the fall.  The edge of the cataract is crimped\r\nby indentations which exalt its beauty.  Here and there, a little\r\nbelow the highest ledge, a secondary one juts out; the water strikes\r\nit and bursts from it in huge protuberant masses of foam and spray. We\r\npassed Goat Island, came to the Horseshoe, and worked for a time along\r\nits base, the boulders over which Conroy and myself had scrambled a\r\nfew days previously lying between us and the cataract.  A rock was\r\nbefore us, concealed and revealed at intervals, as the waves passed\r\nover it.  Our leader tried to get above this rock, first on the\r\noutside of it.  The water, however, was here in violent motion.  The\r\nmen struggled fiercely, the older one ringing out an incessant peal of\r\ncommand and exhortation to the younger.  As we were just clearing the\r\nrock, the bow came obliquely to the surge; the boat was turned\r\nsuddenly round and shot with astonishing rapidity down the river.  The\r\nmen returned to the charge, now trying to get up between the\r\nhalf-concealed rock and the boulders to the left.  But the torrent set\r\nin strongly through this channel.  The tugging was quick and violent,\r\nbut we made little way.  At length, seizing a rope, the principal\r\noarsman made a desperate attempt to get upon one of the boulders,\r\nhoping to be able to drag the boat through the channel; but it bumped\r\nso violently against the rock, that the man flung himself back and\r\nrelinquished the attempt.\r\n\r\nWe returned along the base of the American Fall, running in and out\r\namong the currents which rushed, from it laterally into the river.\r\nSeen from below the American Fall is certainly exquisitely beautiful,\r\nbut it is a mere frill of adornment to its nobler neighbour the\r\nHorseshoe.  At times we took to the river, from the centre of which\r\nthe Horseshoe Fall appeared especially magnificent.  A streak of cloud\r\nacross the neck of Mont Blanc can double its apparent height, so here\r\nthe green summit of the cataract shining above the smoke of spray\r\nappeared lifted to an extraordinary elevation.  Had Hennepin and La\r\nHontan seen the fall from this position, their estimates of the height\r\nwould have been perfectly excusable.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nFrom a point a little way below the American Fall, a ferry crosses\r\nthe river, in summer, to the Canadian side.  Below the ferry is a\r\nsuspension bridge for carriages and foot-passengers, and a mile or two\r\nlower down is the railway suspension bridge.  Between ferry and bridge\r\nthe river Niagara flows unruffled; but at the suspension bridge the\r\nbed steepens and the river quickens its motion.  Lower down the gorge\r\nnarrows, and the rapidity and turbulence increase.  At the place\r\ncalled the 'Whirlpool Rapids' I estimated the width of the river at\r\n300 feet, an estimate confirmed by the dwellers on the spot.  When it\r\nis remembered that the drainage of nearly half a continent is\r\ncompressed into this space, the impetuosity of the river's rush may be\r\nimagined.  Had it not been for Mr. Bierstädt, the distinguished\r\nphotographer of Niagara, I should have quitted the place without\r\nseeing these rapids; for this, and for his agreeable company to the\r\nspot, I have to thank him.  From the edge of the cliff above the\r\nrapids, we descended, a little, I confess, to a climber's disgust, in\r\nan 'elevator,' because the effects are best seen from the water level.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of motion are here obviously active, a motion of translation\r\nand a motion of undulation--the race of the river through its gorge,\r\nand the great waves generated by its collision with, and rebound from,\r\nthe obstacles in its way.  In the middle of the river the rush and\r\ntossing are most violent; at all events, the impetuous force of the\r\nindividual waves is here most strikingly displayed.  Vast pyramidal\r\nheaps leap incessantly from the river, some of them with such energy\r\nas to jerk their summits into the air, where they hang momentarily\r\nsuspended in crowds of liquid spherules.  The sun shone for a few\r\nminutes.  At times the wind, coming up the river, searched and sifted\r\nthe spray, carrying away the lighter drops, and leaving the heavier\r\nones behind.  Wafted in the proper direction, rainbows appeared and\r\ndisappeared fitfully in the lighter mist. In other directions the\r\ncommon gleam of the sunshine from the waves and their shattered crests\r\nwas exquisitely beautiful.  The complexity of the action was still\r\nfurther illustrated by the fact, that in some cases, as if by the\r\nexercise of a local explosive force, the drops were shot radially from\r\na particular centre, forming around it a kind of halo.\r\n\r\nThe first impression, and, indeed, the current explanation of these\r\nrapids is, that the central bed of the river is cumbered with large\r\nboulders, and that the jostling, tossing, and wild leaping of the\r\nwater there, are due to its impact against these obstacles.  I doubt\r\nthis explanation.  At all events, there is another sufficient reason\r\nto be taken into account.  Boulders derived from the adjacent cliffs\r\nvisibly cumber the sides of the river.  Against these the water rises\r\nand sinks rhythmically but violently, large waves being thus produced.\r\nOn the generation of each wave, there is an immediate compounding of\r\nthe wave-motion with he river-motion.  The ridges, which in still\r\nwater would proceed in circular curves round the centre of\r\ndisturbance, cross the river obliquely, and the result is that at the\r\ncentre waves commingle, which have really been generated at the sides.\r\nIn the first instance, we had a composition of wave-motion with\r\nriver-motion; here we have the coalescence of waves with waves.  Where\r\ncrest and furrow cross each other, the motion is annulled; where\r\nfurrow and furrow cross, the river is ploughed to a greater depth; and\r\nwhere crest and crest aid each other, we have that astonishing leap of\r\nthe water which breaks the cohesion of the crests, and tosses them\r\nshattered into the air.  From the water level the cause of the action\r\nis not so easily seen; but from the summit of the cliff the lateral\r\ngeneration of the waves, and their propagation to the perfectly\r\nobvious.  If this explanation be correct, the phenomena observed at\r\nthe Whirlpool Rapids form one of the grandest illustrations of the\r\nprinciple of _interference_.  The Nile 'cataract,' Mr.  Huxley informs\r\nme, offers more moderate examples of the same action.\r\n\r\nAt some distance below the Whirlpool Rapids we have the celebrated\r\nwhirlpool itself.  Here the river makes a sudden bend to the\r\nnorth-east, forming nearly a right angle with its previous direction.\r\nThe water strikes the concave bank with great force, and scoops it\r\nincessantly away.  A vast basin has been thus formed, in which the\r\nsweep of the river prolongs itself in gyratory currents.  Bodies and\r\ntrees which have come over the falls, are stated to circulate here for\r\ndays without finding the outlet.  From various points of the cliffs\r\nabove, this is curiously hidden.  The rush of the river into the\r\nwhirlpool is obvious enough; and though you imagine the outlet must be\r\nvisible, if one existed, you cannot find it.  Turning, however, round\r\nthe bend of the precipice to the north-east, the outlet comes into\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe Niagara season was over; the chatter of sightseers had ceased, and\r\nthe scene presented itself as one of holy seclusion and beauty.  I\r\nwent down to the river's edge, where the weird loneliness seemed to\r\nincrease.  The basin is enclosed by high and almost precipitous\r\nbanks--covered, at the time, with russet woods.  A kind of mystery\r\nattaches itself to gyrating water, due perhaps to the fact that we are\r\nto some extent ignorant of the direction of its force.  It is said\r\nthat at certain points of the whirlpool, pine-trees are sucked down,\r\nto be ejected mysteriously elsewhere.  The 'water is of the brightest\r\nemerald-green.  The gorge through which it escapes is narrow, and the\r\nmotion of the river swift though silent.  The surface is steeply\r\ninclined, but it is perfectly unbroken.  There are no lateral waves,\r\nno ripples with their breaking bubbles to raise a murmur; while the\r\ndepth is here too great to allow the inequality of the bed to ruffle\r\nthe surface.  Nothing can be more beautiful than this sloping liquid\r\nmirror formed by the Niagara, in sliding from the whirlpool.\r\n\r\nThe green colour is, I think, correctly accounted for in the last\r\nFragment.  While crossing the Atlantic in 1872-73 I had frequent\r\nopportunities of testing the explanation there given.  Looked properly\r\ndown upon, there are portions of the ocean to which we should hardly\r\nascribe a trace of blue; at the most, a mere hint of indigo reaches\r\nthe eye.  The water, indeed, is practically black, and this is an\r\nindication both of its depth and of its freedom from mechanically\r\nsuspended matter.  In small thicknesses water is sensibly transparent\r\nto all kinds of light; but, as the thickness increases, the rays of\r\nlow refrangibility are first absorbed, and after them the other rays.\r\nWhere, therefore, the water is very deep and very pure, all the\r\ncolours are absorbed, and such water ought to appear black, as no\r\nlight is sent from its interior to the eye.  The approximation of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean to this condition is an indication of its extreme\r\npurity.\r\n\r\nThrow a white pebble into such water; as it sinks it becomes greener\r\nand greener, and, before it disappears, it reaches a vivid blue-green.\r\nBreak such a pebble into fragments, each of these will behave like the\r\nunbroken mass; grind the pebble to powder, every particle will yield\r\nits modicum of green; and if the particles be so fine as to remain\r\nsuspended in the water, the scattered light will be a uniform green.\r\nHence the greenness of shoal water.  You go to bed with the black\r\nAtlantic around you.  You rise in the morning, find it a vivid green,\r\nand correctly infer that you are crossing the bank of Newfoundland.\r\nSuch water is found charged with fine matter in a state of mechanical\r\nsuspension.  The light from the bottom may sometimes come into play,\r\nbut it is not necessary.  A storm can render the water muddy, by\r\nrendering the particles too numerous and gross.  Such a case occurred\r\ntowards the close of my visit to Niagara.  There had been rain and\r\nstorm in the upper lake-regions, and the quantity of suspended matter\r\nbrought down quite extinguished the fascinating green of the\r\nHorseshoe.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more superb than the green of the Atlantic waves, when\r\nthe circumstances are favourable to the exhibition of the colour.  As\r\nlong as a wave remains unbroken no colour appears; but when the foam\r\njust doubles over the crest, like an Alpine snow-cornice, under the\r\ncornice we often see a display of the most exquisite green.  It is\r\nmetallic in its brilliancy.  But the foam is necessary to its\r\nproduction.  The foam is first illuminated, and it scatters the light\r\nin all directions; the light which passes through the higher portion\r\nof the wave alone reaches the eye, and gives to that portion its\r\nmatchless colour.  The folding of the wave, producing as it does, a\r\nseries of longitudinal protuberances and furrows which act like\r\ncylindrical lenses, introduces variations in the intensity of the\r\nlight, and materially enhances its beauty.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the genesis and proximate destiny of the Falls\r\nof Niagara.  We may open our way to this subject by a few preliminary\r\nremarks upon erosion.  Time and intensity are the main factors of\r\ngeologic change, and they are in a certain sense convertible.  A\r\nfeeble force acting through long periods, and an intense force acting\r\nthrough short ones, may produce approximately the same results.  To\r\nDr. Hooker I have been indebted for some specimens of stones, the\r\nfirst examples of which were picked up by Mr. Hackworth on the shores\r\nof Lyell's Bay, near Wellington, in New Zealand.  They were described\r\nby Mr. Travers in the 'Transactions of the New Zealand Institute.'\r\nUnacquainted with their origin, you would certainly ascribe their\r\nforms to human workmanship.  They resemble knives and spear-heads,\r\nbeing apparently chiselled off into facets, with as much attention to\r\nsymmetry as if a tool, guided by human intelligence, had passed over\r\nthem.  But no human instrument has been brought to bear upon these\r\nstones.  They have been wrought into their present shape by the\r\nwind-blown sand of Lyell's Bay.  Two winds are, dominant here, and\r\nthey in succession urged the sand against opposite sides of the stone;\r\nevery little particle of sand chipped away its infinitesimal bit of\r\nstone, and in the end sculptured these singular forms. [Footnote:\r\n'These stones, which have a strong resemblance to works of human art,\r\noccur in great abundance, and of various sizes, from half-an-inch to\r\nseveral inches in length.  A large number were exhibited showing the\r\nvarious forms, which are those of wedges, knives, arrow-heads, &c, and\r\nall with sharp cutting edges.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Travers explained that, notwithstanding their artificial\r\nappearance, these stones were formed by the cutting action of the\r\nwind-driven sand, as it passed to and fro over an exposed\r\nboulder-bank.  He gave a minute account of the manner in which the\r\nvarieties of form are produced, and referred to the effect which the\r\nerosive action thus indicated would have on railway and other works\r\nexecuted on sandy tracts.\r\n\r\n'Dr. Hector stated that although, as a group, the specimens on the\r\ntable could not well be mistaken for artificial productions, still the\r\nforms are so peculiar, and the edges, in a few of them, so perfect,\r\nthat if they were discovered associated with human works, there is no\r\ndoubt that they would have been referred to the so-called \"stone\r\nperiod.\"'--Extracted from the Minutes of the Wellington Philosophical\r\nSociety, February 9, 1869.]\r\n\r\nThe Sphynx of Egypt is nearly covered up by the sand of the desert.\r\nThe neck of the Sphynx is partly cut across, not, as I am assured by\r\nMr. Huxley, by ordinary weathering, but by the eroding action of the\r\nfine sand blown against it.  In these cases Nature furnishes us with\r\nhints which may be taken advantage of in art; and this action of sand\r\nhas been recently turned to extraordinary account in the United\r\nStates.  When in Boston, I was taken by my courteous and helpful\r\nfriend, Mr. Josiah Quincey, to see the action of the sand-blast. A\r\nkind of hopper containing fine silicious sand was connected with a\r\nreservoir of compressed air, the pressure being variable at pleasure.\r\nThe hopper ended in a long slit, from which the sand was blown.  A\r\nplate of glass was placed beneath this slit, and caused to pass slowly\r\nunder it; it came out perfectly depolished, with a bright opalescent\r\nglimmer, such as could only be produced by the most careful grinding.\r\nEvery little particle of sand urged against the glass, having all its\r\nenergy concentrated on the point of impact, formed there a little pit,\r\nthe depolished surface consisting of innumerable hollows of this\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all.  By protecting certain portions of the surface,\r\nand exposing others, figures and tracery of any required form could be\r\netched upon the glass.  The figures of open iron-work could be thus\r\ncopied; while wire-gauze placed over the glass produced a reticulated\r\npattern.  But it required no such resisting substance as iron to\r\nshelter the glass.  The patterns of the finest lace could be thus\r\nreproduced; the delicate filaments of the lace itself offering a\r\nsufficient protection.  All these effects have been obtained with a\r\nsimple model of the sand-blast devised by my assistant.  A fraction of\r\na minute suffices to etch upon glass a rich and beautiful lace\r\npattern.  Any yielding substance may be employed to protect the glass.\r\nBy diffusing the shock of the particle, such substances practically\r\ndestroy the local erosive power.  The hand can bear, without\r\ninconvenience, a sand-shower which would pulverise glass.  Etchings\r\nexecuted on glass with suitable kinds of ink are accurately worked out\r\nby the sandblast. In fact, within certain limits, the harder the\r\nsurface, the greater is the concentration of the shock, and the more\r\neffectual is the erosion.  It is not necessary that the sand should be\r\nthe harder substance of the two; corundum, for example, is much harder\r\nthan quartz; still, quartz-sand can not only depolish, but actually\r\nblow a hole through a plate of corundum.  Nay, glass may be depolished\r\nby the impact of fine shot; the grains in this case bruising the\r\nglass, before they have time to flatten and turn their energy into\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nAnd here, in passing, we may tie together one or two apparently\r\nunrelated facts.  Supposing you turn on, at the lower part of a house,\r\na cock which is fed by a pipe from a cistern at the top of the house,\r\nthe column of water, from the cistern downwards, is set in motion.  By\r\nturning off the cock, this motion is stopped; and, when the turning\r\noff is very sudden, the pipe, if not strong, may be burst by the\r\ninternal impact of the water.  By distributing the turning of the cock\r\nover half a second of time, the shock and danger of rupture may be\r\nentirely avoided.  We have here an example of the concentration of\r\nenergy in time.  The sand-blast illustrates the concentration of\r\nenergy in space.  The action of flint and steel is an illustration of\r\nthe same principle.  The heat required to generate the spark is\r\nintense; and the mechanical action, being moderate, must, to produce\r\nfire, be in the highest degree concentrated.  This concentration is\r\nsecured by the collision of hard substances.  Calc-spar will not\r\nsupply the place of flint, nor lead the place of steel, in the\r\nproduction of fire by collision.  With the softer substances, the\r\ntotal heat produced may be greater than with the hard ones, but, to\r\nproduce the spark, the heat must be intensely localised.\r\n\r\nWe can, however, go far beyond the mere depolishing of glass; indeed I\r\nhave already said that quartz-sand can wear a hole through corundum.\r\nThis leads me to express my acknowledgments to General Tilghman, who\r\nis the inventor of the sand-Blast. [Footnote: The absorbent power,\r\nif I may use the phrase, exerted by the industrial arts in the United\r\nStates, is forcibly illustrated by the rapid transfer of men like\r\nMr. Tilghman from the life of the soldier to that of the civilian.\r\nGeneral McClellan, now a civil engineer, whom I had the honour of\r\nfrequently meeting in New York, is a most eminent example of the same\r\nkind.  At the end of the war, indeed, a million and a half of men were\r\nthus drawn, in an astonishingly short time, from military to civil\r\nlife.]  To his spontaneous kindness I am indebted for some beautiful\r\nillustrations of his process.  In one thick plate of glass a figure\r\nhas been worked out to a depth of three eighths of an inch.  A second\r\nplate, seven eighths of an inch thick, is entirely perforated.  In a\r\ncircular plate of marble, nearly half an inch thick, open work of most\r\nintricate and elaborate description has been executed.  It would\r\nprobably take many days to perform this work by any ordinary process;\r\nwith the sand-blast it was accomplished in an hour.  So much for the\r\nstrength of the blast; its delicacy is illustrated by this beautiful\r\nexample of line engraving, etched on glass by means of the Blast.\r\n\r\nThis power of erosion, so strikingly displayed when sand is urged by\r\nair, renders us better able to conceive its action when urged by\r\nwater.  The erosive power of a river is vastly augmented by the solid\r\nmatter carried along with it.  Sand or pebbles, caught in a river\r\nvortex, can wear away the hardest rock potholes' and deep cylindrical\r\nshafts being thus produced.  An extraordinary instance of this kind of\r\nerosion is to be seen in the Val Tournanche, above the village of this\r\nname.  The gorge at Handeck has been thus cut out.  Such waterfalls\r\nwere once frequent in the valleys of Switzerland; for hardly any\r\nvalley is without one or more transverse barriers of resisting\r\nmaterial, over which the river flowing through the valley once fell as\r\na cataract.  Near Pontresina, in the Engadin, there is such a case; a\r\nhard gneiss being there worn away to form a gorge, through which the\r\nriver from the Morteratsch glacier rushes.  The barrier of the Kirchet\r\nabove Meyringen is also a case in point.  Behind it was a lake,\r\nderived from the glacier of the Aar, and over the barrier the lake\r\npoured its excess of water.  Here the rock, being limestone, was in\r\npart dissolved; but added to this we had the action of the sand and\r\ngravel carried along by the water, which, on striking the rock,\r\nchipped it away like the particles of the sand-Blast. Thus, by\r\nsolution and mechanical erosion, the great chasm of the\r\nFinsteraarschlucht was formed.  It is demonstrable that the water\r\nwhich flows at the bottoms of such deep fissures once flowed at the\r\nlevel of their present edges, and tumbled down the lower faces of the\r\nbarriers.  Almost every valley in Switzerland furnishes examples of\r\nthis kind; the untenable hypothesis of earthquakes, once so readily\r\nresorted to in accounting for these gorges, being now for the most\r\npart abandoned.  To produce the Canons of Western America, no other\r\ncause is needed than the integration of effects individually\r\ninfinitesimal.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to Niagara.  Soon after Europeans had taken possession\r\nof the country, the conviction appears to have arisen that the deep\r\nchannel of the river Niagara below the falls had been excavated by the\r\ncataract.  In Mr. Bakewell's 'Introduction to Geology,' the prevalence\r\nof this belief has been referred to.  It is expressed thus by\r\nProfessor Joseph Henry in the 'Transactions of the Albany Institute:'\r\n[Footnote: Quoted by Bakewell.] 'In viewing the position of the\r\nfalls, and the features of the country round, it is impossible not to\r\nbe impressed with the idea that this great natural raceway has been\r\nformed by the continued action of the irresistible Niagara, and that\r\nthe falls, beginning at Lewiston, have, in the course of ages, worn\r\nback the rocky strata to their present site.' The same view is\r\nadvocated by Sir Charles Lyell, by Mr. Hall, by M. Agassiz, by\r\nProfessor Ramsay, indeed by most of those who have inspected the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nA connected image of the origin and progress of the cataract is easily\r\nobtained.  Walking northward from the village of Niagara Falls by the\r\nside of the river, we have to our left the deep and comparatively\r\nnarrow gorge, through which the Niagara flows.  The bounding cliffs of\r\nthis gorge are from 300 to 350 feet high.  We reach the whirlpool,\r\ntrend to the north-east, and after a little time gradually resume our\r\nnorthward course.  Finally, at about seven miles from the present\r\nfalls, we come to the edge of a declivity, which informs us that we\r\nhave been hitherto walking on table-land.  At some hundreds of feet\r\nbelow us is a comparatively level plain, which stretches to Lake\r\nOntario.  The declivity marks the end of the precipitous gorge of the\r\nNiagara.  Here the river escapes from its steep mural boundaries, and\r\nin a widened bed pursues its way to the lake which finally receives\r\nits waters.\r\n\r\nThe fact that in historic times, even within the memory of man, the\r\nfall has sensibly receded, prompts the question, How far has this\r\nrecession gone?  At what point did the ledge which thus continually\r\ncreeps backwards begin its retrograde course?  To minds disciplined in\r\nsuch researches the answer has been, and will be--At the precipitous\r\ndeclivity which crossed the Niagara from Lewiston on the American to\r\nQueenston on the Canadian side.  Over this transverse barrier the\r\nunited affluents of all the upper lakes once poured their waters, and\r\nhere the work of erosion began.  The dam, moreover, was demonstrably\r\nof sufficient height to cause the river above it to submerge Goat\r\nIsland; and this would perfectly account for the finding by Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, Mr. Hall, and others, in the sand and gravel of the\r\nisland, the same fluviatile shells as are now found in the Niagara\r\nRiver higher up.  It would also account for those deposits along the\r\nsides of the river, the discovery of which enabled Lyell, Hall, and\r\nRamsay to reduce to demonstration the popular belief that the Niagara\r\nonce flowed through a shallow valley.\r\n\r\nThe physics of the problem of excavation, which I made clear to my\r\nmind before quitting Niagara, are revealed by a close inspection of\r\nthe present Horseshoe Fall.  We see evidently that the greatest weight\r\nof water bends over the very apex of the Horseshoe.  In a passage in\r\nhis excellent chapter on Niagara Falls, Mr. Hall alludes to this fact.\r\nHere we have the most copious and the most violent whirling of the\r\nshattered liquid; here the most powerful eddies recoil against the\r\nshale.  From this portion of the fall, indeed, the spray sometimes\r\nrises without solution of continuity to the region of clouds, becoming\r\ngradually more attenuated, and passing finally through the condition\r\nof true cloud into invisible vapour, which is sometimes reprecipitated\r\nhigher up.  All the phenomena point distinctly to the centre of the\r\nriver as the place of greatest mechanical energy, and from the centre\r\nthe vigour of the fall gradually dies away towards the sides.  The\r\nHorseshoe form, with the concavity facing downwards, is an obvious and\r\nnecessary consequence of this action.  Right along the middle of the\r\nriver the apex of the curve pushes its way backwards, cutting along\r\nthe centre a deep and comparatively narrow groove, and draining the\r\nsides as it passes them. [Footnote: In the discourse the excavation of\r\nthe centre and drainage of the sides action was illustrated by a model\r\ndevised by my assistant, Mr. John Cottrell.]  Hence the remarkable\r\ndiscrepancy between the widths of the Niagara above and below the\r\nHorseshoe.  All along its course, from Lewiston Heights to its present\r\nposition, the form of the fall was probably that of a horseshoe; for\r\nthis is merely the expression of the greater depth, and consequently\r\ngreater excavating power, of the centre of the river.  The gorge,\r\nmoreover, varies in width, as the depth of the centre of the ancient\r\nriver varied, being narrowest where that depth was greatest.\r\n\r\nThe vast comparative erosive energy of the Horseshoe Fall comes\r\nstrikingly into view when it and the American Fall are compared\r\ntogether.  The American branch of the river is cut at a right angle by\r\nthe gorge of the Niagara.  Here the Horseshoe Fall was the real\r\nexcavator.  It cut the rock, and formed the precipice, over which the\r\nAmerican Fall tumbles.  But since its formation, the erosive action of\r\nthe American Fall has been almost nil, while the Horseshoe has cut its\r\nway for 600 yards across the end of Goat Island, and is now doubling\r\nback to excavate its channel parallel to the length of the island.\r\nThis point, which impressed me forcibly, has not, I have just learned,\r\nescaped the acute observation of Professor Ramsay. [Footnote: His\r\nwords are: 'Where the body of water is small in the American Fall, the\r\nedge has only receded a few yards (where most eroded) during the time\r\nthat the Canadian Fall has receded from the north corner of Goat\r\nIsland to the innermost curve of the Horseshoe Fall.'--Quarterly\r\nJournal of Geological Society, May 1859.]  The river bends; the\r\nHorseshoe immediately accommodates itself to the bending, and will\r\nfollow implicitly the direction of the deepest water in the upper\r\nstream.  The flexures of the gorge are determined by those of the\r\nriver channel above it.  Were the Niagara centre above the fall\r\nsinuous, the gorge would obediently follow its sinuosities.  Once\r\nsuggested, no doubt geographers will be able to point out many\r\nexamples of this action.  The Zambesi is thought to present a great\r\ndifficulty to the erosion theory, because of the sinuosity of the\r\nchasm below the Victoria Falls.  But, assuming the basalt to be of\r\ntolerably uniform texture, had the river been examined before the\r\nformation of this sinuous channel, the present zigzag course of the\r\ngorge below the fall could, I am persuaded, have been predicted, while\r\nthe sounding of the present river would enable us to predict the\r\ncourse to be pursued by the erosion in the future.\r\n\r\nBut not only has the Niagara River cut the gorge; it has carried away\r\nthe chips of its own workshop.  The shale, being probably crumbled, is\r\neasily carried away.  But at the base of the fall we find the huge\r\nboulders already described, and by some means or other these are\r\nremoved down the river.  The ice which fills the gorge in winter, and\r\nwhich grapples with the boulders, has been regarded as the\r\ntransporting agent.  Probably it is so to some extent.  But erosion\r\nacts without ceasing on the abutting points of the boulders, thus\r\nwithdrawing their support and urging them gradually down the river.\r\nSolution also does its portion of the work.  That solid matter is\r\ncarried down is proved by the difference of depth between the Niagara\r\nRiver and Lake Ontario, where the river enters it.  The depth falls\r\nfrom 72 feet to 20 feet, in consequence of the deposition of solid\r\nmatter caused by the diminished motion of the river. [Footnote: Near\r\nthe mouth of the gorge at Queenston, the depth, according to the\r\nAdmiralty Chart, is 180 feet; well within the gorge it is 132 feet.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed highly instructive map has been reduced from one published\r\nin Mr. Hall's 'Geology of New York.' It is based on surveys executed\r\nin 1842, by Messrs.  Gibson and Evershed.  The ragged edge of the\r\nAmerican Fall north of Goat Island marks the amount of erosion which\r\nit has been able to accomplish, while the Horseshoe Fall was cutting\r\nits way southward across the end of Goat Island to its present\r\nposition.  The American Fall is 168 feet high, a precipice cut down,\r\nnot by itself, but by the Horseshoe Fall.  The latter in 1842 was 159\r\nfeet high, and, as shown by the map, is already turning eastward, to\r\nexcavate its gorge along the centre of the upper river.  P is the apex\r\nof the Horseshoe, and T marks the site of the Terrapin Tower, with the\r\npromontory adjacent, round which I was conducted by Conroy.  Probably\r\nsince 1842 the Horseshoe has worked back beyond the position here\r\nassigned to it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may say a word regarding the proximate future of\r\nNiagara.  At the rate of excavation assigned to it by Sir Charles\r\nLyell, namely, a foot a year, five thousand years or so will carry the\r\nHorseshoe Fall far higher than Goat Island.  As the gorge recedes it\r\nwill drain, as it has hitherto done, the banks right and left of it,\r\nthus leaving a nearly level terrace between Goat Island and the edge\r\nof the gorge.  Higher up it will totally drain the American branch of\r\nthe river; the channel of which in due time will become cultivable\r\nland.  The American Fall will then be transformed into a dry\r\nprecipice, forming a simple continuation of the cliffy boundary of the\r\nNiagara gorge.  At the place occupied by the fall at this moment we\r\nshall have the gorge enclosing a right angle, a second whirlpool being\r\nthe consequence.  To those who visit Niagara a few millenniums hence I\r\nleave the verification of this prediction.  All that can be said is,\r\nthat if the causes now in action continue to act, it will prove itself\r\nliterally true.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nFig.  6.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nA year or so after I had quitted the United States, a man sixty years\r\nof age, while engaged in painting one of the bridges which connect\r\nGoat Island with the Three Sisters, slipped through the rails of the\r\nbridge into the rapids, and was carried impetuously towards the\r\nHorseshoe Fall.  He was urged against a rock which rose above the\r\nwater, and with the grasp of desperation he clung to it.  The\r\npopulation of the village of Niagara Falls was soon upon the island,\r\nand ropes were brought, but there was none to use them.  In the midst\r\nof the excitement, a tall powerful young fellow was observed making\r\nhis way silently through the crowd.  He reached a rope; selected from\r\nthe bystanders a number of men, and placed one end of the rope in\r\ntheir hands.  The other end he fastened round himself, and choosing a\r\npoint considerably above that to which the man clung, he plunged into\r\nthe rapids.  He was carried violently downwards, but he caught the\r\nrock, secured the old painter and saved him.  Newspapers from all\r\nparts of the Union poured in upon me, describing this gallant act of\r\nmy guide Conroy.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nVIII.  THE PARALLEL ROADS OF GLEN ROY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A discourse delivered at the Royal Institution of Great\r\nBritain on June 9, 1876.]\r\n\r\nTHE first published allusion to the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy occurs\r\nin the appendix to the third volume of Pennant's 'Tour in Scotland,' a\r\nwork published in 1776.  'In the face of these hills,' says this\r\nwriter, 'both sides of the glen, there are three roads at small\r\ndistances from each other and directly opposite on each side.  These\r\nroads have been measured in the complete parts of them, and found to\r\nbe 26 paces of a man 5 feet 10 inches high.  The two highest are\r\npretty near each other, about 50 yards, and the lowest double that\r\ndistance from the nearest to it.  They are carried along the sides of\r\nthe glen with the utmost regularity, nearly as exact as drawn with a\r\nline of rule and compass.'\r\n\r\nThe correct heights of the three roads of Glen Roy are respectively\r\n1150, 1070, and 860 feet above the sea.  Hence a vertical distance of\r\n80 feet separates the two highest, while the lowest road is 210 feet\r\nbelow the middle one.\r\n\r\nThese 'roads' are usually shelves or terraces formed in the yielding\r\ndrift which here covers the slopes of the mountains.  They are all\r\nsensibly horizontal and therefore parallel.  Pennant accepted as\r\nreasonable the explanation of them given by the country people in his\r\ntime.  They thought that the roads 'were designed for the chase, and\r\nthat the terraces were made after the spots were cleared in lines from\r\nwood, in order to tempt the animals into the open paths after they\r\nwere rouzed, in order that they might come within reach of the bowmen\r\nwho might conceal themselves in the woods above and below.'\r\n\r\nIn these attempts of 'the country people' we have an illustration of\r\nthat impulse to which all scientific knowledge is due--the desire to\r\nknow the causes of things; and it is a matter of surprise that in the\r\ncase of the parallel roads, with their weird appearance challenging\r\nenquiry, this impulse did not make itself more rapidly and\r\nenergetically felt.  Their remoteness may perhaps account for the fact\r\nthat until the year 1817 no systematic description of them, and no\r\nscientific attempt at an explanation of them, appeared.  In that year\r\nDr. MacCulloch, who was then President of the Geological Society,\r\npresented to that Society a memoir, in which the roads were discussed,\r\nand pronounced to be the margins of lakes once embosomed in Glen Roy.\r\nWhy there should be three roads, or why the lakes should stand at\r\nthese particular levels, was left unexplained.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. MacCulloch succeeded a man, possibly not so learned as a\r\ngeologist, but obviously fitted by nature to grapple with her facts\r\nand to put them in their proper setting.  I refer to Sir Thomas\r\nDick-Lauder, who presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, on the\r\n2nd of March, 1818, his paper on the Parallel Roads of Glen.  Roy.  In\r\nlooking over the literature of this subject, which is now copious, it\r\nis interesting to observe the differentiation of minds, and to single\r\nout those who went by a kind of instinct to the core of the question,\r\nfrom those who erred in it, or who learnedly occupied themselves with\r\nits analogies, adjuncts, and details.  There is no man, in my opinion,\r\nconnected with the history of the subject, who has shown, in relation\r\nto it, this spirit of penetration, this force of scientific insight,\r\nmore conspicuously than Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder.  Two distinct mental\r\nprocesses are involved in the treatment of such a question.  Firstly,\r\nthe faithful and sufficient observation of the data; and secondly,\r\nthat higher mental process in which the constructive imagination comes\r\ninto play, connecting the separate facts of observation with their\r\ncommon cause, and weaving them into an organic whole.  In neither of\r\nthese requirements did Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder fail.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to Glen Roy is a valley called Glen Gluoy, along the sides of\r\nwhich ran a single shelf, or terrace, formed obviously in the same\r\nmanner as the parallel roads of Glen Roy.  The two shelves on the\r\nopposing sides of the glen were at precisely the same level, and\r\nDick-Lauder wished to see whether, and how, they became united at the\r\nhead of the glen.  He followed the shelves into the recesses of the\r\nmountains.  The bottom of the valley, as it rose, came ever nearer to\r\nthem, until finally, at the head of Glen Gluoy, he reached a col, or\r\nwatershed, of precisely the same elevation as the road which swept\r\nround the glen.\r\n\r\nThe correct height of this col is 1170 feet above the sea; that is to\r\nsay, 20 feet above the highest road in Glen Roy.\r\n\r\nFrom this col a lateral branch-valley--Glen Turrit--led down to Glen\r\nRoy.  Our explorer descended from the col to the highest road of the\r\nlatter glen, and pursued it exactly as he had pursued the road in Glen\r\nGluoy.  For a time it belted the mountain sides at a considerable\r\nheight above the bottom of the valley; but this rose as he proceeded,\r\ncoming ever nearer to the highest shelf, until finally he reached a\r\ncol, or watershed, looking into Glen Spey, and of precisely the same\r\nelevation as the highest road of Glen Roy.\r\n\r\nHe then dropped down to the lowest of these roads, and followed it\r\ntowards the mouth of the glen.  Its elevation above the bottom of the\r\nvalley gradually increased; not because the shelf rose, but because it\r\nremained level while the valley sloped downwards.  He found this\r\nlowest road doubling round the hills at the mouth of Glen Roy, and\r\nrunning along the sides of the mountains which flank Glen Spean.  He\r\nfollowed it eastwards.\r\n\r\nPARALLEL ROADS OF GLEN ROY.\r\n\r\nAfter a Sketch by Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the Spean Valley, like the others, gradually rose, and\r\ntherefore gradually approached the road on the adjacent mountain-side.\r\nHe came to Loch Laggan, the surface of which rose almost to the level\r\nof the road, and beyond the head of this lake he found, as in the\r\nother two cases, a col, or watershed, at Makul, of exactly the same\r\nlevel as the single road in Glen Spean, which, it will be remembered,\r\nis a continuation of the lowest road in Glen Roy.\r\n\r\nHere we have a series of facts of obvious significance as regards the\r\nsolution of this problem.  The effort of the mind to form a coherent\r\nimage from such facts may be compared with the effort of the eyes to\r\ncause the pictures of a stereoscope to coalesce.  For a time we\r\nexercise a certain strain, the object remaining vague and indistinct.\r\nSuddenly its various parts seem to run together, the object starting\r\nforth in clear and definite relief.  Such, I take it, was the effect\r\nof his ponderings upon the mind of Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder.  His\r\nsolution was this: Taking all their features into account, he was\r\nconvinced that water only could have produced the terraces.  But how\r\nhad the water been collected?  He saw clearly that, supposing the\r\nmouth of Glen Gluoy to be stopped by a barrier sufficiently high, if\r\nthe waters from the mountains flanking the glen were allowed to\r\ncollect, they would form behind the barrier a lake, the surface of\r\nwhich would gradually rise until it reached the level of the col at\r\nthe head of the glen.  The rising would then cease; the superfluous\r\nwater of Glen Gluoy discharging itself over the col into Glen Roy.  As\r\nlong as the barrier stopping the mouth of Glen Gluoy continued high\r\nenough, we should have in that glen a lake at the precise level of its\r\nshelf, which lake, acting upon the loose drift of the flanking\r\nmountains, would form the shelf revealed by observation.\r\n\r\nSo much for Glen Gluoy.  But suppose the mouth of Glen Roy also\r\nstopped by a similar barrier.  Behind it also the water from the\r\nadjacent mountains would collect.  The surface of the lake thus formed\r\nwould gradually rise, until it had reached the level of the col which\r\ndivides Glen Roy from Glen Spey.  Here the rising of the lake would\r\ncease; its superabundant water being poured over the col into the\r\nvalley of the Spey.  This state of things would continue as long as a\r\nsufficiently high barrier remained at the mouth of Glen Roy.  The lake\r\nthus dammed in, with its surface at the level of the highest parallel\r\nroad, would act, as in Glen Gluoy, upon the friable drift\r\noverspreading the mountains, and would form the highest road or\r\nterrace of Glen Roy.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us suppose the barrier to be so far removed from the mouth\r\nof Glen Roy as to establish a connection between it and the upper part\r\nof Glen Spean, while the lower part of the latter glen still continued\r\nto be blocked up.  Upper Glen Spean and Glen Roy would then be\r\noccupied by a continuous lake, the level of which would obviously be\r\ndetermined by the col at the head of Loch Laggan.  The water in Glen\r\nRoy would sink from the level it had previously maintained, to the\r\nlevel of its new place of escape.  This new lake-surface would\r\ncorrespond exactly with the lowest parallel road, and it would form\r\nthat road by its action upon the drift of the adjacent mountains.\r\n\r\nIn presence of the observed facts, this solution commends itself\r\nstrongly to the scientific mind.  The question next occurs, What was\r\nthe character of the assumed barrier which stopped the glens?  There\r\nare at the present moment vast masses of detritus in certain portions\r\nof Glen Spean, and of such detritus Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder imagined\r\nhis barriers to have been formed.  By some unknown convulsion, this\r\ndetritus had been heaped up.  But, once given, and once granted that\r\nit was subsequently removed in the manner indicated, the single road\r\nof Glen Gluoy and the highest and lowest roads of Glen Roy would be\r\nexplained in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nTo account for the second or middle road of Glen Roy, Sir Thomas\r\nDick-Lauder invoked a new agency.  He supposed that at a certain point\r\nin the breaking down or waste of his dam, a halt occurred, the barrier\r\nholding its ground at a particular level sufficiently long to dam a\r\nlake rising to the height of, and forming the second road.  This point\r\nof weakness was at once detected by Mr. Darwin, and adduced by him as\r\nproving that the levels of the cols did not constitute an essential\r\nfeature in the phenomena of the parallel roads.  Though not destroyed,\r\nSir Thomas Dick-Lauder's theory was seriously shaken by this argument,\r\nand it became a point of capital importance, if the facts permitted,\r\nto remove such source of weakness.  This was done in 1847 by Mr. David\r\nMilne, now Mr. Milne-Home.  On walking up Glen Roy from Roy Bridge, we\r\npass the mouth of a lateral glen, called Glen Glaster, running\r\neastward from Glen Roy.  There is nothing in this lateral glen to\r\nattract attention, or to suggest that it could have any conspicuous\r\ninfluence in the production of the parallel roads.  Hence, probably,\r\nthe failure of Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder to notice it.  But Mr.\r\nMilne-Home entered this glen, on the northern side of which the middle\r\nand lowest roads are fairly shown.  The principal stream running\r\nthrough the glen turns at a certain point northwards and loses itself\r\namong hills too high to offer any outlet.  But another branch of the\r\nglen turns to the south-east; and, following up this branch, Mr.\r\nMilne-Home reached a col, or watershed, of the precise level of the\r\nsecond Glen Roy road.  When the barrier blocking the glens had been so\r\nfar removed as to open this col, the water in Glen Roy would sink to\r\nthe level of the second road.  A new lake of diminished depth would be\r\nthus formed, the surplus water of which would escape over the Glen\r\nGlaster col into Glen Spean.  The margin of this new lake, acting upon\r\nthe detrital matter, would form the second road.  The theory of Sir\r\nThomas Dick-Lauder, as regards the part played by the cols, was\r\nre-riveted by this new and unexpected discovery.\r\n\r\nI have referred to Mr. Darwin, whose powerful mind swayed for a time\r\nthe convictions of the scientific world in relation to this question.\r\nHis notion was--and it is a notion which very naturally presents\r\nitself--that the parallel roads were formed by the sea; that this\r\nwhole region was once submerged and subsequently upheaved; that there\r\nwere pauses in the process of upheaval, during which these glens\r\nconstituted so many fiords, on the sides of which the parallel\r\nterraces were formed.  This theory will not bear close criticism; nor\r\nis it now maintained by Mr. Darwin himself.  It would not account for\r\nthe sea being 20 feet higher in Glen Gluoy than in Glen Roy.  It would\r\nnot account for the absence of the second and third Glen Roy roads\r\nfrom Glen Gluoy, where the mountain flanks are quite as impressionable\r\nas in Glen Roy.  It would not account for the absence of the shelves\r\nfrom the other mountains in the neighbourhood, all of which 'would\r\nhave been clasped by the sea had the sea been there.  Here then, and\r\nno doubt elsewhere, Mr. Darwin has shown himself to be fallible; but\r\nhere, as elsewhere, he has shown himself equal to that discipline of\r\nsurrender to evidence which girds his intellect with such unassailable\r\nmoral strength.\r\n\r\nBut, granting the significance of Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder's facts, and\r\nthe reasonableness, on the whole, of the views which he has founded on\r\nthem, they will not bear examination in detail.  No such barriers of\r\ndetritus as he assumed could have existed without leaving traces\r\nbehind them; but there is no trace left.  There is detritus enough in\r\nGlen Spean, but not where it is wanted.  The two highest parallel\r\nroads stop abruptly at different points near the mouth of Glen Roy,\r\nbut no remnant of the barrier against which they abutted is to be\r\nseen.  It might be urged that the subsequent invasion of the valley by\r\nglaciers has swept the detritus away; but there have been no glaciers\r\nin these valleys since the disappearance of the lakes.  Professor\r\nGeikie has favoured me with a drawing of the Glen Spean 'road' near\r\nthe entrance to Glen Trieg.  The road forms a shelf round a great\r\nmound of detritus which, had a glacier followed the formation of the\r\nshelf, must have been cleared away.  Taking all the circumstances into\r\naccount, you may, I think, with safety dismiss the detrital barrier as\r\nincompetent to account for the present condition of Glen Gluoy and\r\nGlen Roy.\r\n\r\nHypotheses in science, though apparently transcending experience, are\r\nin reality experience modified by scientific thought and pushed into\r\nan ultra experiential region.  At the time that he wrote, Sir Thomas\r\nDick-Lauder could not possibly have discerned the cause subsequently\r\nassigned for the blockage of these glens.  A knowledge of the action\r\nof ancient glaciers was the necessary antecedent to the new\r\nexplanation, and experience of this nature was not possessed by the\r\ndistinguished writer just mentioned.  The extension of Swiss glaciers\r\nfar beyond their present limits, was first made known by a Swiss\r\nengineer named Venetz, who established, by the marks they had left\r\nbehind them, their former existence in places which they had long\r\nforsaken.  The subject of glacier extension was subsequently followed\r\nup with distinguished success by Charpentier, Studer, and others. With\r\ncharacteristic vigour Agassiz grappled with it, extending his\r\nobservations far beyond the domain of Switzerland.  He came to this\r\ncountry in 1840, and found in various places indubitable marks of\r\nancient glacier action.  England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland he\r\nproved to have once given birth to glaciers.  He visited Glen Roy,\r\nsurveyed the surrounding neighbourhood, and pronounced, as a\r\nconsequence of his investigation, the barriers which stopped the glens\r\nand produced the parallel roads to have been barriers of ice.  To Mr.\r\nJamieson, above all others, we are indebted for the thorough testing\r\nand confirmation of this theory.\r\n\r\nAnd let me here say that Agassiz is only too likely to be misrated and\r\nmisjudged by those who, though accurate within a limited sphere, fail\r\nto grasp in their totality the motive powers invoked in scientific\r\ninvestigation.  True he lacked mechanical precision, but he abounded\r\nin that force and freshness of the scientific imagination which in\r\nsome sciences, and probably in some stages of all sciences, are\r\nessential to the creator of knowledge.  To Agassiz was given, not the\r\nart of the refiner, but the instinct of the discoverer, and the\r\nstrength of the delver who brings ore from the recesses of the mine.\r\nThat ore may contain its share of dross, but it also contains the\r\nprecious metal which gives employment to the refiner, and without\r\nwhich his occupation would depart.\r\n\r\nLet us dwell for a moment upon this subject of ancient glaciers. Under\r\na flask containing water, in which a thermometer is immersed, is\r\nplaced a Bunsen's lamp.  The water is heated, reaches a temperature of\r\n212°, and then begins to boil.  The rise of the thermometer then\r\nceases, although heat continues to be poured by the lamp into the\r\nwater.  What becomes of that heat?  We know that it is consumed in the\r\nmolecular work of vaporization.  In the experiment here arranged, the\r\nsteam passes from the flask through a tube into a second vessel kept\r\nat a low temperature.  Here it is condensed, and indeed congealed to\r\nice, the second vessel being plunged in a mixture cold enough to\r\nfreeze the water.  As a result of the process we obtain a mass of ice.\r\nThat ice has an origin very antithetical to its own character.  Though\r\ncold, it is the child of heat.  If we removed the lamp, there would be\r\nno steam, and if there were no steam there would be no ice.  The mere\r\ncold of the mixture surrounding the second vessel would not produce\r\nice.  The cold must have the proper material to work upon; and this\r\nmaterial--aqueous vapour--is, as we here see, the direct product of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nIt is now, I suppose, fifteen or sixteen years since I found myself\r\nconversing with an illustrious philosopher regarding that glacial\r\nepoch which the researches of Agassiz and others had revealed.  This\r\nprofoundly thoughtful man maintained the fixed opinion that, at a\r\ncertain stage in the history of the solar system, the sun's radiation\r\nhad suffered diminution, the glacial epoch being a consequence of this\r\nsolar chill.  The celebrated French mathematician Poisson had another\r\ntheory.  Astronomers have shown that the solar system moves through\r\nspace, and 'the temperature of space' is a familiar expression with\r\nscientific men.  It was considered probable by Poisson that our\r\nsystem, during its motion, had traversed portions of space of\r\ndifferent temperatures; and that, during its passage through one of\r\nthe colder regions of the universe, the glacial epoch occurred.\r\nNotions such as these were more or less current everywhere not many\r\nyears ago, and I therefore thought it worth while to show how\r\nincomplete they were.  Suppose the temperature of our planet to be\r\nreduced, by the subsidence of solar heat, the cold of space, or any\r\nother cause, say one hundred degrees.  Four-and-twenty hours of such a\r\nchill would bring down as, snow nearly all the moisture of our\r\natmosphere.  But this would not produce a glacial epoch.  Such an\r\nepoch would require the long-continued generation of the material from\r\nwhich the ice of glaciers is derived.  Mountain snow, the nutriment of\r\nglaciers, is derived from aqueous vapour raised mainly from the\r\ntropical ocean by the sun.  The solar fire is as necessary a factor in\r\nthe process as our lamp in the experiment referred to a moment ago.\r\nNothing is easier than to calculate the exact amount of heat expended\r\nby the sun in the production of a glacier.  It would, as I have\r\nelsewhere shown, [Footnote: 'Heat a Mode of Motion,' fifth edition,\r\nchap. vi: Forms of Water, sections 55 and 56.]  raise a quantity of\r\ncast iron five times the weight of the glacier not only to a white\r\nheat, but to its point of fusion.  If, as I have already urged,\r\ninstead of being filled with ice, the valleys of the Alps were filled\r\nwith white-hot metal, of quintuple the mass of the present glaciers,\r\nit is the heat, and not the cold, that would arrest our attention and\r\nsolicit our explanation.  The process of glacier making is obviously\r\none of distillation, in which the fire of the sun, which generates the\r\nvapour, plays as essential a part as the cold of the mountains which\r\ncondenses it. [Footnote: In Lyell's excellent 'Principles of Geology,'\r\nthe remark occurs that 'several writers have fallen into the strange\r\nerror of supposing that the glacial period must have been one of\r\nhigher mean temperature than usual.'  The really strange error was the\r\nforgetfulness of the fact that without the heat the substance\r\nnecessary to the production of glaciers would be wanting.]\r\n\r\nIt was their ascription to glacier action that first gave the parallel\r\nroads of Glen Roy an interest in my eyes; and in 1867, with a view to\r\nself-instruction, I made a solitary pilgrimage to the place, and\r\nexplored pretty thoroughly the roads of the principal glen.  I traced\r\nthe highest road to the col dividing Glen Roy from Glen Spey, and,\r\nthanks to the civility of an Ordnance surveyor, I was enabled to\r\ninspect some of the roads with a theodolite, and to satisfy myself\r\nregarding the common level of the shelves at opposite sides of the\r\nvalley.  As stated by Pennant, the width of the roads amounts\r\nsometimes to more than twenty yards; but near the head of Glen Roy the\r\nhighest road ceases to have any width, for it runs along the face of a\r\nrock, the effect of the lapping of the water on the more friable\r\nportions of the rock being perfectly distinct to this hour.  My\r\nknowledge of the region was, however, far from complete, and nine\r\nyears had dimmed the memory even of the portion which had been\r\nthoroughly examined.  Hence my desire to see the roads once more\r\nbefore venturing to talk to you about them.  The Easter holidays of\r\n1876 were to be devoted to this purpose; but at the last moment a\r\ntelegram from Roy Bridge informed me that the roads were snowed up.\r\nFinding books and memories poor substitutes for the flavour of facts,\r\nI resolved subsequently to make another effort to see the roads.\r\nAccordingly last Thursday fortnight, after lecturing here, I packed\r\nup, and started (not this time alone) for the North.  Next day at noon\r\nmy wife and I found ourselves at Dalwhinnie, whence a drive of some\r\nfive-and-thirty miles brought us to the excellent hostelry of Mr.\r\nMacintosh, at the mouth of Glen Roy.\r\n\r\nWe might have found the hills covered with mist, which would have\r\nwholly defeated us; but Nature was good-natured, and we had two\r\nsuccessful working days among the hills.  Guided by the excellent\r\nordnance map of the region, on the Saturday morning we went up the\r\nglen, and on reaching the stream called Allt Bhreac Achaidh faced the\r\nhills to the west. At the watershed between Glen Roy and Glen Fintaig\r\nwe bore northwards, struck the ridge above Glen Gluoy, came in view of\r\nits road, which we persistently followed as long as it continued\r\nvisible.  It is a feature of all the roads that they vanish before\r\nreaching the cola over which fell the waters of the lakes which formed\r\nthem.  One reason doubtless is that at their upper ends the lakes were\r\nshallow, and incompetent on this account to raise wavelets of any\r\nstrength to act upon the mountain drift.  A second reason is that they\r\nwere land-locked in the higher portions and protected from the\r\nsouth-westerly winds, the stillness of their waters causing them to\r\nproduce but a feeble impression upon the mountain sides.  From Glen\r\nGluoy we passed down Glen Turrit to Glen Roy, and through it\r\nhomewards, thus accomplishing two or three and twenty miles of rough\r\nand honest work.\r\n\r\nNext day we thoroughly explored Glen Glaster, following its two roads\r\nas far as they were visible.  We reached the col discovered by Mr.\r\nMilne-Home, which stands at the level of the middle road of Glen Roy.\r\nThence we crossed southwards over the mountain _Creag Dhubh_, and\r\nexamined the erratic blocks upon its sides, and the ridges and mounds\r\nof moraine matter which cumber the lower flanks of the mountain.  The\r\nobservations of Mr. Jamieson upon this region, including the mouth of\r\nGlen Trieg, are in the highest degree interesting.  We entered Glen\r\nSpean, and continued a search begun on the evening of our arrival at\r\nRoy Bridge--the search, namely, for glacier polishings and markings.\r\nWe did not find them copious, but they are indubitable.\r\n\r\nOne of the proofs most convenient for reference, is a great rounded\r\nrock by the roadside, 1,000 yards east of the milestone marked\r\nthree-quarters of a mile from Roy Bridge.  Farther east other cases\r\noccur, and they leave no doubt upon the mind that Glen Spean was at\r\none time filled by a great glacier.  To the disciplined eye the aspect\r\nof the mountains is perfectly conclusive on this point; and in no\r\nposition can the observer more readily and thoroughly convince himself\r\nof this than at the head of Glen Glaster.  The dominant hills here are\r\nall intensely glaciated.\r\n\r\nBut the great collecting ground of the glaciers which dammed the glens\r\nand produced the parallel roads, were the mountains south and west of\r\nGlen Spean.  The monarch of these is Ben Nevis, 4,370 feet high.  The\r\nposition of Ben Nevis and his colleagues, in reference to the\r\nvapour-laden winds of the Atlantic, is a point of the first\r\nimportance.  It is exactly similar to that of Carrantual and the\r\nMacgillicuddy Reeks in the south-west of Ireland.  These mountains\r\nare, and were, the first to encounter the south-western Atlantic\r\nwinds, and the precipitation, even at present, in the neighbourhood of\r\nKillarney, is enormous.  The winds, robbed of their vapour, and\r\ncharged with the heat set free by its precipitation, pursue their\r\ndirection obliquely across Ireland; and the effect of the drying\r\nprocess may be understood by comparing the rainfall at Cahirciveen\r\nwith that at Portarlington.  As found by Dr. Lloyd, the ratio is as 59\r\nto 21--fifty-nine inches annually at Cahirciveen to twenty-one at\r\nPortarlington.  During the glacial epoch this vapour fell as snow, and\r\nthe consequence was a system of glaciers which have left traces and\r\nevidences of the most impressive character in the region of the\r\nKillarney Lakes.  I have referred in other places to the great glacier\r\nwhich, descending from the Reeks, moved through the Black Valley, took\r\npossession of the lake-basins, and left its traces on every rock and\r\nisland emergent from the waters of the upper lake.  They are all\r\nconspicuously glaciated.  Not in Switzerland itself do we find clearer\r\ntraces of ancient glacier action.\r\n\r\nWhat the Macgillicuddy Reeks did in Ireland, Ben Nevis and the\r\nadjacent mountains did, and continue to do, in Scotland.  We had an\r\nexample of this on the morning we quitted Roy Bridge.  From the bridge\r\nwestward rain fell copiously, and the roads were wet; but the\r\nprecipitation ceased near Loch Laggan, whence eastward the roads were\r\ndry.  Measured by the gauge, the rainfall Fort William is 86 inches,\r\nwhile at Laggan it is only 46 inches annually.  The difference between\r\nwest and east is forcibly brought out by observations at the two ends\r\nof the Caledonian Canal.  Fort William at the south-western end has,\r\nas just stated, 86 inches, while Culloden, at its north-eastern end,\r\nhas only 24.  To the researches of that able and accomplished\r\nmeteorologist, Mr. Buchan, we are indebted for these and other data of\r\nthe most interesting and valuable kind.\r\n\r\nAdhering to the facts now presented to us, it is not difficult to\r\nrestore in idea the process by which the glaciers of Lochaber were\r\nproduced and the glens dammed by ice.  When the cold of the glacial\r\nepoch began to invade the Scottish hills, the sun at the same time\r\nacting with sufficient power upon the tropical ocean, the vapours\r\nraised and drifted on to these 'northern mountains were more and more\r\nconverted into snow.  This slid down the slopes, and from every\r\nvalley, strath, and corry, south of Glen Spean, glaciers were poured\r\ninto that glen.  The two great factors here brought into play are the\r\nnutrition of the glaciers by the frozen material above, and their\r\nconsumption in the milder air below.  For a period supply exceeded\r\nconsumption, and the ice extended, filling Glen Spean to an\r\never-increasing height, and abutting against the mountains to the\r\nnorth of that glen.  But why, it may be asked, should the valleys\r\nsouth of Glen Spean be receptacles of ice at a time when those north\r\nof it were receptacles of water?  The answer is to be found in the\r\nposition and the greater elevation of the mountains south of Glen\r\nSpean.  They first received the loads of moisture carried by the\r\nAtlantic winds, and not until they had been in part dried, and also\r\nwarmed by the liberation of their latent heat, did these winds touch\r\nthe hills north of the Glen.\r\n\r\nAn instructive observation bearing upon this point is here to be\r\nnoted.  Had our visit been in the winter we should have found all the\r\nmountains covered; had it been in the summer we should have found the\r\nsnow all gone.  But happily it was at a season when the aspect of the\r\nmountains north and south of Glen Spean exhibited their relative\r\npowers as snow collectors.  Scanning the former hills from many points\r\nof view, we were hardly able to detect a fleck of snow, while heavy\r\nswaths and patches loaded the latter.  Were the glacial epoch to\r\nreturn, the relation indicated by this observation would cause Glen\r\nSpean to be filled with glaciers from the south, while the hills and\r\nvalleys on the north, visited by warmer and drier winds, would remain\r\ncomparatively free from ice.  This flow from the south would be\r\nreinforced from the west, and as long as the supply was in excess of\r\nthe consumption the glaciers would extend, the dams which closed the\r\nglens increasing in height.  By-and-by supply and consumption becoming\r\napproximately equal, the height of the glacier barriers would remain\r\nconstant.  Then, as milder weather set in, consumption would be in\r\nexcess, a lowering of the barriers and a retreat of the ice being the\r\nconsequence.  But for a long time the conflict between supply and\r\nconsumption would continue, retarding indefinitely the disappearance\r\nof the barriers, and keeping the imprisoned lakes in the northern\r\nglens.  But however slow its retreat, the ice in the long run would be\r\nforced to yield.  The dam at the mouth of Glen Roy, which probably\r\nentered the glen sufficiently far to block up Glen Glaster, would\r\ngradually retreat.  Glen Glaster and its col being opened, the\r\nsubsidence of the lake eighty feet, from the level of the highest to\r\nthat of the second parallel road, would follow as a consequence.  I\r\nthink this the most probable course of things, but it is also possible\r\nthat Glen Glaster may have been blocked by a glacier from Glen Trieg.\r\nThe ice dam continuing to retreat, at length permitted Glen Roy to\r\nconnect itself with upper Glen Spean.  A continuous lake then filled\r\nboth glens, the level of which, as already explained, was determined\r\nby the col at Makul, above the head of Loch Laggan.  The last to yield\r\nwas the portion of the glacier which derived nutrition from Ben Nevis,\r\nand probably also from the mountains north and south of Loch Arkaig.\r\nBut it at length yielded, and the waters in the glens resumed the\r\ncourses which they pursue to-day.\r\n\r\nFor the removal of the ice barriers no cataclysm is to be invoked; the\r\ngradual melting of the dam would produce the entire series of\r\nphenomena.  In sinking from col to col the water would flow over a\r\ngradually melting barrier, the surface of the imprisoned lake not\r\nremaining sufficiently long at any particular level to produce a shelf\r\ncomparable to the parallel roads.  By temporary halts in the process\r\nof melting due to atmospheric conditions or to the character of the\r\ndam itself, or through local softness in the drift, small\r\npseudo-terraces would be formed, which, to the perplexity of some\r\nobservers, are seen upon the flanks of the glens to-day.\r\n\r\nIn presence then of the fact that the barriers which stopped these\r\nglens to a height, it may be, of 1,500 feet above the bottom of Glen\r\nSpean, have dissolved and left not a wreck behind; in presence of the\r\nfact, insisted on by Professor Geikie, that barriers of detritus would\r\nundoubtedly have been able to maintain themselves had they ever been\r\nthere; in presence of the fact that great glaciers once most certainly\r\nfilled these valleys--that the whole region, as proved by Mr.\r\nJamieson, is filled with the traces of their action; the theory which\r\nascribes the parallel roads to lakes dammed by barriers of ice has, in\r\nmy opinion, a degree of probability on its side which amounts to a\r\npractical demonstration of its truth.\r\n\r\nInto the details of the terrace formation I do not enter.  Mr. Darwin\r\nand Mr. Jamieson on the one side, and Sir John Lubbock on the other,\r\ndeal with true causes.  The terraces, no doubt, are due in part to the\r\ndescending drift arrested by the water, and in part to the fretting of\r\nthe wavelets, and the rearrangement of the stirred detritus, along the\r\nbelts of contact of lake and bill.  The descent of matter must have\r\nbeen frequent when the drift was unbound by the rootlets which hold it\r\ntogether now.  In some cases, it may be remarked, the visibility of\r\nthe roads is materially augmented by differences of vegetation.  The\r\ngrass upon the terraces is not always of the same character as that\r\nabove and below them, while on heather-covered hills the absence of\r\nthe dark shrub from the roads greatly enhances their conspicuousness.\r\n\r\nThe annexed sketch of a model will enable the reader to grasp the\r\nessential features of the problem and its solution.  Glen Gluoy and\r\nGlen Roy are lateral valleys which open into Glen Spean.  Let us\r\nsuppose Glen Spean filled from v to w with ice of a uniform elevation\r\nof 1,500 feet above the sea, the ice not filling the upper part of\r\nthat glen.  The ice would thrust itself for some distance up the\r\nlateral valleys, closing all their mouths.  The streams from the\r\nmountains right and left of Glen Gluoy would pour their waters into\r\nthat glen, forming a lake, the level of which would be determined by\r\nthe height of the col at A, 1170 feet above the sea.  Over this col\r\nthe water would flow into Glen Roy.  But in Glen Roy it could not rise\r\nhigher than 1150 feet, the height of the col at B, over which it would\r\nflow into Glen Spey.\r\n\r\nThe water halting at these levels for a sufficient time, would form\r\nthe single road in Glen Gluoy and the highest road in Glen Roy.  This\r\nstate of things would continue as long as the ice dam was sufficiently\r\nhigh to dominate the cols at A and B; but when through change of\r\nclimate the gradually sinking dam reached, in succession, the levels\r\nof these cols, the water would then begin to flow over the dam instead\r\nof over the cols.  Let us suppose the wasting of the ice to continue\r\nuntil a connection was established between Glen Roy and Glen Glaster,\r\na common lake would then fill both these glens, the level of which\r\nwould be determined by that of the col c, over which the water would\r\npour for an indefinite period into Glen Spean.  During this period the\r\nsecond Glen Roy road and the highest road of Glen Glaster would be\r\nformed.  The ice subsiding still further, a connection would\r\neventually be established between Glen Roy, Glen Glaster, and the\r\nupper part of Glen Spean.  A common lake would fill all three glens,\r\nthe level of which would be that of the col D, over which for an\r\nindefinite period the lake would pour its water.  During this period\r\nthe lowest Glen Roy road, which is common also to Glen Glaster and\r\nGlen Spean, would be formed.  Finally, on the disappearance of the ice\r\nfrom the lower part of Glen Spean the waters would flow down their\r\nrespective valleys as they do to-day.\r\n\r\nFig.  7\r\n\r\nReviewing our work, we find three considerable steps to have marked\r\nthe solution of the problem of the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy.  The\r\nfirst of these was taken by Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder, the second was the\r\npregnant conception of Agassiz regarding glacier action, and the third\r\nwas the testing and verification of this conception by the very\r\nthorough researches of Mr. Jamieson.  No circumstance or incident\r\nconnected with this discourse gives me greater pleasure than the\r\nrecognition of the value of these researches.  They are marked\r\nthroughout by unflagging industry, by novelty and acuteness of\r\nobservation, and by reasoning power of a high and varied kind.  These\r\npages had been returned 'for press' when I learned that the relation\r\nof Ben Nevis and his colleagues to the vapour-laden winds of the\r\nAtlantic had not escaped Mr. Jamieson.  To him obviously the\r\nexploration of Lochaber, and the development of the theory of the\r\nParallel Roads, has been a labour of love.\r\n\r\nThus ends our rapid survey of this brief episode in the physical\r\nhistory of the Scottish hills,--brief, that is to say, in comparison\r\nwith the immeasurable lapses of time through which, to produce its\r\nvaried structure and appearances, our planet must have passed.  In the\r\nsurvey of such a field two things are specially worthy to be taken\r\ninto account--the widening of the intellectual horizon and the\r\nreaction of expanding knowledge upon the intellectual organ itself.\r\n\r\nAt first, as in the case of ancient glaciers, through sheer want of\r\ncapacity, the mind refuses to take in revealed facts.  But by degrees\r\nthe steady contemplation of these facts so strengthens and expands the\r\nintellectual powers, that where truth once could not find an entrance\r\nit eventually finds a home. [Footnote: The formation, connection,\r\nsuccessive subsidence, and final disappearance of the glacial lakes of\r\nLochaber were illustrated in the discourse here reported by the model\r\njust described, constructed under the supervision of my assistant, Mr.\r\nJohn Cottrell.  Glen Gluoy with its lake and road and the cataract\r\nover its col; Glen Roy and its three roads with their respective\r\ncataracts at the head of Glen Spey, Glen Glaster, and Glen Spean, were\r\nall represented.  The successive shiftings of the barriers, which were\r\nformed of plate glass, brought each successive lake and its\r\ncorresponding road into view, while the entire removal of the barriers\r\ncaused the streams to flow down the glens of the model as they flow\r\ndown the real glens of to-day.]\r\n\r\nA map of the district, with the parallel roads shown in red, is\r\nannexed.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE SUBJECT.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PENNANT.--A Tour in Scotland.

ALPINE SCULPTURE.\r\n\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nTO account for the conformation of the Alps, two hypotheses have been\r\nadvanced, which may be respectively named the hypothesis of fracture\r\nand the hypothesis of erosion.  The former assumes that the forces by\r\nwhich the mountains were elevated produced fissures in the earth's\r\ncrust, and that the valleys of the Alps are the tracks of these\r\nfissures; while the latter maintains that the valleys have been cut\r\nout by the action of ice and water, the mountains themselves being the\r\nresidual forms of this grand sculpture.  I had heard the Via Mala\r\ncited as a conspicuous illustration of the fissure theory--the\r\nprofound chasm thus named, and through which the Hinter-Rhein now\r\nflows, could, it was alleged, be nothing else than a crack in the\r\nearth's crust. To the Via Mala I therefore went in 1864 to instruct\r\nmyself upon the point in question.\r\n\r\nThe gorge commences about a quarter of an hour above Tusis; and, on\r\nentering it, the first impression certainly is that it must be a\r\nfissure.  This conclusion in my case was modified as I advanced.  Some\r\ndistance up the gorge I found upon the slopes to my right quantities\r\nof rolled stones, evidently rounded by water-action.  Still further\r\nup, and just before reaching the first bridge which spans the chasm, I\r\nfound more rolled stones, associated with sand and gravel.  Through\r\nthis mass of detritus, fortunately, a vertical cutting had been made,\r\nwhich exhibited a section showing perfect stratification.  There was\r\nno agency in the place to roll these stones, and to deposit these\r\nalternating layers of sand and pebbles, but the river which now rushes\r\nsome hundreds of feet below them.  At one period of the Via Mala's\r\nhistory the river must have run at this high level.  Other evidences\r\nof water-action soon revealed themselves.  From the parapet of the\r\nfirst bridge I could see the solid rock 200 feet above the bed of the\r\nriver scooped and eroded.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the guide-books that the river, which usually runs\r\nalong the bottom of the gorge, has been known almost to fill it during\r\nviolent thunder-storms; and it may be urged that the marks of erosion\r\nwhich the sides of the chasm exhibit are due to those occasional\r\nfloods.  In reply to this, it may be stated that even the existence of\r\nsuch floods is not well authenticated, and that if the supposition\r\nwere true, it would be an additional argument in favour of the cutting\r\npower of the river.  For if floods operating at rare intervals could\r\nthus erode the rock, the same agency, acting without ceasing upon the\r\nriver's bed, must certainly be competent to excavate it.\r\n\r\nI proceeded upwards, and from a point near another bridge (which of\r\nthem I did not note) had a fine view of a portion of the gorge.  The\r\nriver here runs at the bottom of a cleft of profound depth, but so\r\nnarrow that it might be leaped across.  That this cleft must be a\r\ncrack is the impression first produced; but a brief inspection\r\nsuffices to prove that it has been cut by the river.  From top to\r\nbottom we have the unmistakable marks of erosion.  This cleft was best\r\nseen on looking downwards from a point near the bridge; but looking\r\nupwards from the bridge itself, the evidence of aqueous erosion was\r\nequally convincing.\r\n\r\nThe character of the erosion depends upon the rock as well as upon the\r\nriver.  The action of water upon some rocks is almost purely\r\nmechanical; they are simply ground away or detached in sensible\r\nmasses.  Water, however, in passing over limestone, charges itself\r\nwith carbonate of lime without damage to its transparency; the rock is\r\ndissolved in the water; and the gorges cut by water in such rocks\r\noften resemble those cut in the ice of glaciers by glacier streams. To\r\nthe solubility of limestone is probably to be ascribed the fantastic\r\nforms which peaks of this rock usually assume, and also the grottos\r\nand caverns which interpenetrate limestone formations.  A rock capable\r\nof being thus dissolved will expose a smooth surface after the water\r\nhas quitted it; and in the case of the Via Mala it is the polish of\r\nthe surfaces and the curved hollows scooped in the sides of the gorge,\r\nwhich assure us that the chasm has been the work of the river.\r\n\r\nAbout four miles from Tusis, and not far from the little village of\r\nZillis, the Via Mala opens into a plain bounded by high terraces.  It\r\noccurred to me the moment I saw it that the plain had been the bed of\r\nan ancient lake; and a farmer, who was my temporary companion,\r\nimmediately informed me that such was the tradition of the\r\nneighbourhood.  This man conversed with intelligence, and as I drew\r\nhis attention to the rolled stones, which rest not only above the\r\nriver, but above the road, and inferred that the river must once have\r\nbeen there to have rolled those stones, he saw the force of the\r\nevidence perfectly.  In fact, in former times, and subsequent to the\r\nretreat of the great glaciers, a rocky barrier crossed the valley at\r\nthis place, damming the river which came from the mountains higher up.\r\nA lake was thus formed which poured its waters over the barrier.  Two\r\nactions were here at work, both tending to obliterate the lake--the\r\nraising of its bed by the deposition of detritus, and the cutting of\r\nits dam by the river.  In process of time the cut deepened into the\r\nVia Mala; the lake was drained, and the river now flows in a definite\r\nchannel through the plain which its waters once totally covered.\r\n\r\nFrom Tusis I crossed to Tiefenkasten by the Schien Pass, and thence\r\nover the Julier Pass to Pontresina.  There are three or four ancient\r\nlake-beds between Tiefenkasten and the summit of the Julier.  They are\r\nall of the same type--a more or less broad and level valley-bottom,\r\nwith a barrier in front through which the river has cut a passage, the\r\ndrainage of the lake being the consequence.  These lakes were\r\nsometimes dammed by barriers of rock, sometimes by the moraines of\r\nancient glaciers.\r\n\r\nAn example of this latter kind occurs in the Rosegg valley, about\r\ntwenty minutes below the end of the Rosegg glacier, and about an hour\r\nfrom Pontresina.  The valley here is crossed by a pine-covered moraine\r\nof the noblest dimensions; in the neighbourhood of London it might be\r\ncalled a mountain.  That it is a moraine, the inspection of it from a\r\npoint on the Surlei slopes above it will convince any person\r\npossessing an educated eye.  Where, moreover, the interior of the\r\nmound is exposed, it exhibits moraine-matter--detritus pulverised by\r\nthe ice, with boulders entangled in it.  It stretched quite across the\r\nvalley, and at one time dammed the river up.  But now the barrier is\r\ncut through, the stream having about one-fourth of the moraine to its\r\nright, and the remaining three-fourths to its left.  Other moraines of\r\na more resisting character hold their ground as barriers to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nIn the Val di Campo, for example, about three-quarters of an hour from\r\nPisciadello, there is a moraine composed of large boulders, which\r\ninterrupt the course of a river and compel the water to fall over them\r\nin cascades.  They have in great part resisted its action since the\r\nretreat of the ancient glacier which formed the moraine.  Behind the\r\nmoraine is a lake-bed, now converted into a level meadow, which rests\r\non a deep layer of mould.\r\n\r\nAt Pontresina a very fine and instructive gorge is to be seen.  The\r\nriver from the Morteratsch glacier rushes through a deep and narrow\r\nchasm which is spanned at one place by a stone bridge.  The rock is\r\nnot of a character to preserve smooth polishing; but the larger\r\nfeatures of water-action are perfectly evident from top to bottom.\r\nThose features are in part visible from the bridge, but still better\r\nfrom a point a little distance from the bridge in the direction of the\r\nupper village of Pontresina.  The hollowing out of the rock by the\r\neddies of the water is here quite manifest. A few minutes' walk\r\nupwards brings us to the end of the gorge; and behind it we have the\r\nusual indications of an ancient lake, and terraces of distinct water\r\norigin.  From this position indeed the genesis of the gorge is clearly\r\nrevealed.  After the retreat of the ancient glacier, a transverse\r\nridge of comparatively resisting material crossed the valley at this\r\nplace.  Over the lowest part of this ridge the river flowed, rushing\r\nsteeply down to join at the bottom of the slope the stream which\r\nissued from the Rosegg glacier.  On this incline the water became a\r\npowerful eroding agent, and finally cut the channel to its present\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nGeological writers of reputation assume at this place the existence of\r\na fissure, the 'washing out' of which resulted in the formation of the\r\ngorge.  Now no examination of the bed of the river ever proved the\r\nexistence of this fissure; and it is certain that water, particularly\r\nwhen charged with solid matter in suspension, can cut a channel\r\nthrough unfissured rock.  Cases of deep cutting can be pointed out\r\nwhere the clean bed of the stream is exposed, the rock which forms the\r\nfloor of the river not exhibiting a trace of fissure.  An example of\r\nthis kind on a small scale occurs near the Bernina Gasthaus, about two\r\nhours from Pontresina.  A little way below the junction of the two\r\nstreams from the Bernina Pass and the Heuthal the river flows through\r\na channel cut by itself, and 20 or 30 feet in depth.  At some places\r\nthe river-bed is covered with rolled stones; at other places it is\r\nbare, but shows no trace of fissure.  The abstract power of water, if\r\nI may use the term, to cut through rock is demonstrated by such\r\ninstances.  But if water be competent to form a gorge without the aid\r\nof a fissure, why assume the existence of such fissures in cases like\r\nthat at Pontresina?  It seems far more philosophical to accept the\r\nsimple and impressive history written on the walls of those gorges by\r\nthe agent which produced them.\r\n\r\nNumerous cases might be pointed out, varying in magnitude, but all\r\nidentical in kind, of barriers which crossed valleys and formed lakes\r\nhaving been cut through by rivers, narrow gorges being the\r\nconsequence.  One of the most famous examples of this kind is the\r\nFinsteraarschlucht in the valley of Hash.  Here the ridge called the\r\nKirchet seems split across, and the river Aar rushes through the\r\nfissure.  Behind the barrier we have the meadows and pastures of Imhof\r\nresting on the sediment of an ancient lake.  Were this an isolated\r\ncase, one might with an apparent show of reason conclude that the\r\nFinsteraarschlucht was produced by an earthquake, as some suppose it\r\nto have been; but when we find it to be a single sample of actions\r\nwhich are frequent in the Alps--when probably a hundred cases of the\r\nsame kind, though different in magnitude, can be pointed out--it seems\r\nquite unphilosophical to assume that in each particular case an\r\nearthquake was at hand to form a channel for the river.  As in the case\r\nof the barrier at Pontresina, the Kirchet, after the retreat of the\r\nAar glacier, dammed the waters flowing from it, thus forming a lake,\r\non the bed of which now stands the village of Imhof.  Over this\r\nbarrier the Aar tumbled towards Meyringen, cutting, as the centuries\r\npassed, its bed ever deeper, until finally it became deep enough to\r\ndrain the lake, leaving in its place the alluvial plain, through which\r\nthe river now flows in a definite channel.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 I subjected the Finsteraarschlucht to a close examination. The\r\nearthquake theory already adverted to was then prevalent regarding it,\r\nand I wished to see whether any evidences existed of aqueous erosion.\r\nNear the summit of the Kirchet is a signboard inviting the traveller\r\nto visit the Aarenschlucht, a narrow lateral gorge which runs down to\r\nthe very bottom of the principal one.  The aspect of this smaller\r\nchasm from bottom to top proves to demonstration that water had in\r\nformer ages been there at work.  It is scooped, rounded, and polished,\r\nso as to render palpable to the most careless eye that it is a gorge\r\nof erosion.  But it was regarding the sides of the great chasm that\r\ninstruction was needed, and from its edge nothing to satisfy me could\r\nbe seen.  I therefore stripped and waded into the river until a point\r\nwas reached which commanded an excellent view of both sides of the\r\ngorge.  The water was cutting cold, but I was repaid.  Below me on the\r\nleft-hand side was a jutting cliff which bore the thrust of the river\r\nand caused the Aar to swerve from its direct course.  From top to\r\nbottom this cliff was polished, rounded, and scooped.  There was no\r\nroom for doubt.  The river which now runs so deeply down had once been\r\nabove.  It has been the delver of its own channel through the barrier\r\nof the Kirchet.\r\n\r\nBut the broad view taken by the advocates of the fracture theory is,\r\nthat the valleys themselves follow the tracks of primeval fissures\r\nproduced by the upheaval of the land, the cracks across the barriers\r\nreferred to being in reality portions of the great cracks which formed\r\nthe valleys.  Such an argument, however, would virtually concede the\r\ntheory of erosion as applied to the valleys of the Alps.  The narrow\r\ngorges, often not more than twenty or thirty feet across, sometimes\r\neven narrower, frequently occur at the bottom of broad valleys.  Such\r\nfissures might enter into the list of accidents which gave direction\r\nto the real erosive agents which scooped the valley out; but the\r\nformation of the valley, as it now exists, could no more be ascribed\r\nto such cracks than the motion of a railway train could be ascribed to\r\nthe finger of the engineer which turns on the steam.\r\n\r\nThese deep gorges occur, I believe, for the most part in limestone\r\nstrata; and the effects which the merest driblet of water can produce\r\non limestone are quite astonishing.  It is not uncommon to meet chasms\r\nof considerable depth produced by small streams the beds of which are\r\ndry for a large portion of the year.  Right and left of the larger\r\ngorges such secondary chasms are often found.  The idea of time must,\r\nI think, be more and more included in our reasonings on these\r\nphenomena.  Happily, the marks which the rivers have, in most cases,\r\nleft behind them, and which refer, geologically considered, to actions\r\nof yesterday, give us ground and courage to conceive what may be\r\neffected in geologic periods.  Thus the modern portion of the Via Mala\r\nthrows light upon the whole.  Near Bergün, in the valley of the\r\nAlbula, there is also a little Via Mala, which is not less significant\r\nthan the great one.  The river flows here through a profound limestone\r\ngorge, and to the very edges of the gorge we have the evidences of\r\nerosion.  But the most striking illustration of water-action upon\r\nlimestone rock that I have ever seen is the gorge at Pfaeffers.  Here\r\nthe traveller passes along the side of the chasm midway between top\r\nand bottom.  Whichever way he looks, backwards or forwards, upwards or\r\ndownwards, towards the sky or towards the river, he meets everywhere\r\nthe irresistible and impressive evidence that this wonderful fissure\r\nhas been sawn through the mountain by the waters of the Tamina.\r\n\r\nI have thus far confined myself to the consideration of the gorges\r\nformed by the cutting through of the rock-barriers which frequently\r\ncross the valleys of the Alps; as far as they have been examined by me\r\nthey are the work of erosion.  But the larger question still remains,\r\nTo what action are we to ascribe the formation of the valleys\r\nthemselves?  This question includes that of the formation of the\r\nmountain-ridges, for were the valleys wholly filled, the ridges would\r\ndisappear.  Possibly no answer can be given to this question which is\r\nnot beset with more or less of difficulty.  Special localities might\r\nbe found which would seem to contradict every solution which, refers\r\nthe conformation of the Alps to the operation of a single cause.\r\n\r\nStill the Alps present features of a character sufficiently definite\r\nto bring the question of their origin within the sphere of close\r\nreasoning.  That they were in whole or in part once beneath the sea\r\nwill not be disputed; for they are in great part composed of\r\nsedimentary rocks which required a sea to form them.  Their present\r\nelevation above the sea is due to one of those local changes in the\r\nshape of the earth which have been of frequent occurrence throughout\r\ngeologic time, in some cases depressing the land, and in others\r\ncausing the sea-bottom to protrude beyond its surface.  Considering\r\nthe inelastic character of its materials, the protuberance of the Alps\r\ncould hardly have been pushed out without dislocation and fracture;\r\nand this conclusion gains in probability when we consider the\r\nfoldings, contortions, and even reversals in position of the strata in\r\nmany parts of the Alps.  Such changes in the position of beds which\r\nwere once horizontal could not have been effected without dislocation.\r\nFissures would be produced by these changes; and such fissures, the\r\nadvocates of the fracture theory contend, mark the positions of the\r\nvalleys of the Alps.\r\n\r\nImagination is necessary to the man of science, and we could not\r\nreason on our present subject without the power of presenting mentally\r\na picture of the earth's crust cracked and fissured by the forces\r\nwhich produced its upheaval.  Imagination, however, must be strictly\r\nchecked by reason and by observation.  That fractures occurred cannot,\r\nI think, be doubted, but that the valleys of the Alps are thus formed\r\nis a conclusion not at all involved in the admission of dislocations.\r\nI never met with a precise statement of the manner in which the\r\nadvocates of the fissure theory suppose the forces to have\r\nacted--whether they assume a general elevation of the region, or a\r\nlocal elevation of distinct ridges; or whether they assume local\r\nsubsidences after a general elevation, or whether they would superpose\r\nupon the general upheaval minor and local upheavals.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any distinct statement, I will assume the elevation\r\nto be general--that a swelling out of the earth's crust occurred here,\r\nsufficient to place the most prominent portions of the protuberance\r\nthree miles above the sea-level.  To fix the ideas, let us consider a\r\ncircular portion of the crust, say one hundred miles in diameter, and\r\nlet us suppose, in the first instance, the circumference of this\r\ncircle to remain fixed, and that the elevation was confined to the\r\nspace within it.  The upheaval would throw the crust into a state of\r\nstrain; and, if it were inflexible, the strain must be relieved by\r\nfracture.  Crevasses would thus intersect the crust. Let us now\r\nenquire what proportion the area of these open fissures is likely to\r\nbear to the area of the unfissured crust. An approximate answer is all\r\nthat is here required; for the problem is of such a character as to\r\nrender minute precision unnecessary.\r\n\r\nNo one, I think, would affirm that the area of the fissures would be\r\none-hundredth the area of the land.  For let us consider the strain\r\nupon a single line drawn over the summit of the protuberance from a\r\npoint on its rim to a point opposite.  Regarding the protuberance as a\r\nspherical swelling, the length of the arc corresponding to a chord of\r\n100 miles and a versed sine of 3 miles is 100.24 miles; consequently\r\nthe surface to reach its new position must stretch 0.24 of a mile, or\r\nbe broken.  A fissure or a number of cracks with this total width\r\nwould relieve the strain; that is to say, the sum of the widths of all\r\nthe cracks over the length of 100 miles would be 420 yards.  If,\r\ninstead of comparing the width of the fissures with the length of the\r\nlines of tension, we compared their areas with the area of the\r\nunfissured land, we should of course find the proportion much less.\r\nThese considerations will help the imagination to realise what a small\r\nratio the area of the open fissures must bear to the unfissured crust.\r\nThey enable us to say, for example, that to assume the area of the\r\nfissures to be one-tenth of the area of the land would be quite\r\nabsurd, while that the area of the fissures could be one-half or more\r\nthan one-half that of the land would be in a proportionate degree\r\nunthinkable.  If we suppose the elevation to be due to the shrinking\r\nor subsidence of the land all round our assumed circle, we arrive\r\nequally at the conclusion that the area of the open fissures would be\r\naltogether insignificant as compared with that of the unfissured\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\nTo those who have seen them from a commanding elevation, it is\r\nneedless to say that the Alps themselves bear no sort of resemblance\r\nto the picture which this theory presents to us.  Instead of deep\r\ncracks with approximately vertical walls, we have ridges running into\r\npeaks, and gradually sloping to form valleys.  Instead of a fissured\r\ncrust, we have a state of things closely resembling the surface of the\r\nocean when agitated by a storm.  The valleys, instead of being much\r\nnarrower than the ridges, occupy the greater space.  A plaster cast of\r\nthe Alps turned upside down, so as to invert the elevations and\r\ndepressions, would exhibit blunter and broader mountains, with\r\nnarrower valleys between them, than the present ones.  The valleys\r\nthat exist cannot, I think, with any correctness of language be called\r\nfissures.  It may be urged that they originated in fissures: but even\r\nthis is unproved, and, were it proved, the fissures would still play\r\nthe subordinate part of giving direction to the agents which are to be\r\nregarded as the real sculptors of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe fracture theory, then, if it regards the elevation of the Alps as\r\ndue to the operation of a force acting throughout the entire region,\r\nis, in my opinion, utterly incompetent to account for the conformation\r\nof the country.  If, on the other hand, we are compelled to resort to\r\nlocal disturbances, the manipulation of the earth's crust necessary to\r\nobtain the valleys and the mountains will, I imagine, bring the\r\ndifficulties of the theory into very strong relief.  Indeed an\r\nexamination of the region from many of the more accessible\r\neminences--from the Galenstock, the Grauhaupt, the Pitz Languard, the\r\nMonte Confinale--or, better still, from Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa, the\r\nJungfrau, the Finsteraarhorn, the Weisshorn, or the Matterhorn, where\r\nlocal peculiarities are toned down, and the operations of the powers\r\nwhich really made this region what it is are alone brought into\r\nprominence--must, I imagine, convince every physical geologist of the\r\ninability of any fracture theory to account for the present\r\nconformation of the Alps.\r\n\r\nA correct model of the mountains, with an unexaggerated vertical\r\nscale, produces the same effect upon the mind as the prospect from one\r\nof the highest peaks.  We are apt to be influenced by local phenomena\r\nwhich, though insignificant in view of the general question of Alpine\r\nconformation, are, with reference to our customary standards, vast and\r\nimpressive.  In a true model those local peculiarities disappear; for\r\non the scale of a model they are too small to be visible; while the\r\nessential facts and forms are presented to the undistracted attention.\r\n\r\nA minute analysis of the phenomena strengthens the conviction which\r\nthe general aspect of the Alps fixes in the mind.  We find, for\r\nexample, numerous valleys which the most ardent plutonist would not\r\nthink of ascribing to any other agency than erosion.  That such is\r\ntheir genesis and history is as certain as that erosion produced the\r\nChines in the Isle of Wight.  From these indubitable cases of\r\nerosion--commencing, if necessary, with the small ravines which run\r\ndown the flanks of the ridges, with their little working navigators at\r\ntheir bottoms--we can proceed, by almost insensible gradations, to the\r\nlargest valleys of the Alps; and it would perplex the plutonist to fix\r\nupon the point at which fracture begins to play a material part.\r\n\r\nIn ascending one of the larger valleys, we enter it where it is wide\r\nand where the eminences are gentle on either side.  The flanking\r\nmountains become higher and more abrupt as we ascend, and at length we\r\nreach a place where the depth of the valley is a maximum.  Continuing\r\nour walk upwards, we find ourselves flanked by gentler slopes, and\r\nfinally emerge from the valley and reach the summit of an open col, or\r\ndepression in the chain of mountains.  This is the common character of\r\nthe large valleys.  Crossing the col, we descend along the opposite\r\nslope of the chain, and through the same series of appearances in the\r\nreverse order.  If the valleys on both sides of the col were produced\r\nby fissures, what prevents the fissure from prolonging itself across\r\nthe col?  The case here cited is representative; and I am not\r\nacquainted with a single instance in the Alps where the chain has been\r\ncracked in the manner indicated.  The cols are simply depressions; in\r\nmany of which the unfissured rock can be traced from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe typical instance just sketched follows as a natural consequence\r\nfrom the theory of erosion.  Before either ice or water can exert\r\ngreat power as an erosive agent, it must collect in sufficient mass.\r\nOn the higher slopes and plateaus--in the region of cols--the power is\r\nnot fully developed; but lower down tributaries unite, erosion is\r\ncarried on with increased vigour, and the excavation gradually reaches\r\na maximum.  Lower still the elevations diminish and the slopes become\r\nmore gentle; the cutting power gradually relaxes, until finally the\r\neroding agent quits the mountains altogether, and the grand effects\r\nwhich it produced in the earlier portions of its course entirely\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto confined myself to the consideration of the broad\r\nquestion of the erosion theory as compared with the fracture theory;\r\nand all that I have been able to observe and think with reference to\r\nthe subject leads me to adopt the former.  Under the term erosion I\r\ninclude the action of water, of ice, and of the atmosphere, including\r\nfrost and rain.  Water and ice, however, are the principal agents, and\r\nwhich of these two has produced the greatest effect it is perhaps\r\nimpossible to say.  Two years ago I wrote a brief note 'On the\r\nConformation of the Alps,' [Footnote: Phil. Mag. vol. xxiv. p. 169]\r\nin which I ascribed the paramount influence to glaciers.  The facts on\r\nwhich that opinion was founded are, I think, unassailable; but whether\r\nthe conclusion then announced fairly follows from the facts is, I\r\nconfess, an open question.\r\n\r\nThe arguments which have been thus far urged against the conclusion\r\nare not convincing.  Indeed, the idea of glacier erosion appears so\r\ndaring to some minds that its boldness alone is deemed its sufficient\r\nrefutation.  It is, however, to be remembered that a precisely similar\r\nposition was taken up by many excellent workers when the question of\r\nancient glacier extension was first mooted.  The idea was considered\r\ntoo hardy to be entertained; and the evidences of glacial action were\r\nsought to be explained by reference to almost any process rather than\r\nthe true one.  Let those who so wisely took the side of 'boldness' in\r\nthat discussion beware lest they place themselves, with reference to\r\nthe question of glacier erosion, in the position formerly occupied by\r\ntheir opponents.\r\n\r\nLooking at the little glaciers of the present day--mere pigmies as\r\ncompared to the giants of the glacial epoch--we find that from every\r\none of them issues a river more or less voluminous, charged with the\r\nmatter which the ice has rubbed from the rocks.  Where the rocks are\r\nsoft, the amount of this finely pulverised matter suspended in the\r\nwater is very great.  The water, for example, of the river which flows\r\nfrom Santa Catarina to Bormio is thick with it.  The Rhine is charged\r\nwith this matter, and by it has so silted up the Lake of Constance as\r\nto abolish it for a large fraction of its length.  The Rhone is\r\ncharged with it, and tens of thousands of acres of cultivable land are\r\nformed by the silt above the Lake of Geneva.\r\n\r\nIn the case of every glacier we have two agents at work--the ice\r\nexerting a crushing force on every point of its bed which bears its\r\nweight, and either rasping this point into powder or tearing it bodily\r\nfrom the rock to which it belongs; while the water which everywhere\r\ncirculates upon the bed of the glacier continually washes the detritus\r\naway and leaves the rock clean for further abrasion.  Confining the\r\naction of glaciers to the simple rubbing away of the rocks, and\r\nallowing them sufficient time to act, it is not a matter of opinion,\r\nbut a physical certainty, that they will scoop out valleys.  But the\r\nglacier does more than abrade.  Rocks are not homogeneous; they are\r\nintersected by joints and places of weakness, which divide them into\r\nvirtually detached masses.  A glacier is undoubtedly competent to root\r\nsuch masses bodily away.  Indeed the mere _à priori_ consideration of\r\nthe subject proves the competence of a glacier to deepen its bed.\r\nTaking the case of a glacier 1,000 feet deep (and some of the older\r\nones were probably three times this depth), and allowing 40 feet of\r\nice to an atmosphere, we find that on every square inch of its bed\r\nsuch a glacier presses with a weight of 375 lbs, and on every square\r\nyard of its bed with a weight of 486,000 lbs. With a vertical pressure\r\nof this amount the glacier is urged down its valley by the pressure\r\nfrom behind.  We can hardly, I think, deny to such a tool a power of\r\nexcavation.\r\n\r\nThe retardation of a glacier by its bed has been referred to as\r\nproving its impotence as an erosive agent; but this very retardation\r\nis in some measure an expression of the magnitude of the erosive\r\nenergy.  Either the bed must give way, or the ice must slide over\r\nitself.  We get indeed some idea of the crushing pressure which the\r\nmoving glacier exercises against its bed-from the fact that the\r\nresistance, and the effort to overcome it, are such as to make the\r\nupper layers of a glacier move bodily over the lower ones--a portion\r\nonly of the total motion being due to the progress of the entire mass\r\nof the glacier down its valley.\r\n\r\nThe sudden bend in the valley of the Rhone at Martigny has also been\r\nregarded as conclusive evidence against the theory of erosion.  'Why,'\r\nit has been asked, I did not the glacier of the Rhone go straight\r\nforward instead of making this awkward bend?' But if the valley be a\r\ncrack, why did the crack make this bend?  The crack, I submit, had at\r\nleast as much reason to prolong itself in a straight line as the\r\nglacier had.  A statement of Sir John Herschel with reference to\r\nanother matter is perfectly applicable here: 'A crack once produced\r\nhas a tendency to run--for this plain reason, that at its momentary\r\nlimit, at the point at which it has just arrived, the divellent force\r\non the molecules there situated is counteracted only by half of the\r\ncohesive force which acted when there was no crack, viz.  the cohesion\r\nof the uncracked portion alone' ('Proc.  Roy.  Soc.' vol. xii.\r\np. 678).  To account, then, for the bend, the adherent of the fracture\r\ntheory must assume the existence of some accident which turned the\r\ncrack at right angles to itself; and he surely will permit the\r\nadherent of the erosion theory to make a similar assumption.\r\n\r\nThe influence of small accidents on the direction of rivers is\r\nbeautifully illustrated in glacier streams, which are made to cut\r\neither straight or sinuous channels by causes apparently of the most\r\ntrivial character.  In his interesting paper 'On the Lakes of\r\nSwitzerland,' M. Studer also refers to the bend of the Rhine at\r\nSargans in proof that the river must there follow a pre-existing\r\nfissure.  I made a special expedition to the place in 1864; and though\r\nit was plain that M. Studer had good grounds for the selection of this\r\nspot, I was unable to arrive at his conclusion as to the necessity of\r\na fissure.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the interesting volume recently published by the Swiss\r\nAlpine Club, M. Desor informs us that the Swiss naturalists who met\r\nlast year at Samaden visited the end of the Morteratsch glacier, and\r\nthere convinced themselves that a glacier had no tendency whatever to\r\nimbed itself in the soil.  I scarcely think that the question of\r\nglacier erosion, as applied either to lakes or valleys, is to be\r\ndisposed of so easily.  Let me record here my experience of the\r\nMorteratsch glacier.\r\n\r\nI took with me in 1864 a theodolite to Pontresina, and while there had\r\nto congratulate myself on the aid of my friend Mr. Hirst, who in 1857\r\ndid such good service upon the Mer de Glace and its tributaries.  We\r\nset out three lines across the Morteratsch glacier, one of which\r\ncrossed the ice-stream near the well-known hut of the painter Georgei,\r\nwhile the two others were staked out, the one above the hut and the\r\nother below it.  Calling the highest line A, the line which crossed\r\nthe glacier at the hut B, and the lowest line C, the following are the\r\nmean hourly motions of the three lines, deduced from observations\r\nwhich extended over several days.  On each line eleven stakes were\r\nfixed, which are designated by the figures 1, 2, 3, &c.  in the\r\nTables.\r\n\r\nMorteratsch Glacier, Line A.\r\n\r\nNo. of Stake.    Hourly Motion.\r\n\r\n1                 0.35 inch.\r\n\r\n2                 0.49 inch.\r\n\r\n3                 0.53 inch.\r\n\r\n4                 0.54 inch.\r\n\r\n5                 0.56 inch.\r\n\r\n6                 0.54 inch.\r\n\r\n7                 0.52 inch.\r\n\r\n8                 0.49 inch.\r\n\r\n9                 0.40 inch.\r\n\r\n10                0.29 inch.\r\n\r\n11                0.20 inch.\r\n\r\nAs in all other measurements of this kind, the retarding influence of\r\nthe sides of the glacier is manifest: the centre moves with the\r\ngreatest velocity.\r\n\r\nMorteratsch Glacier, Line B.\r\n\r\nNo.  of Stake.    Hourly Motion.\r\n\r\n1                 0.05 inch.\r\n\r\n2                 0.14 inch.\r\n\r\n3                 0.24 inch.\r\n\r\n4                 0.32 inch.\r\n\r\n5                 0-41 inch.\r\n\r\n6                 0.44 inch.\r\n\r\n7                 0.44 inch.\r\n\r\n8                 0.45 inch.\r\n\r\n9                 0.43 inch.\r\n\r\n10                0.44 inch.\r\n\r\n11                0.44 inch.\r\n\r\nThe first stake of this line was quite close to the edge of the\r\nglacier, and the ice was thin at the place, hence its slow motion.\r\nCrevasses prevented us from carrying the line sufficiently far across\r\nto render the retardation of the further side of the glacier fully\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nMorteratsch Glacier, Line C.\r\n\r\nNo.  of Stake     Hourly Motion.\r\n\r\n1                 0.05 inch.\r\n\r\n2                 0.09 inch.\r\n\r\n3                 0.18 inch.\r\n\r\n4                 0.20 inch.\r\n\r\n5                 0.25 inch.\r\n\r\n6                 0.27 inch.\r\n\r\n7                 0.27 inch.\r\n\r\n8                 0.30 inch.\r\n\r\n9                 0.21 inch.\r\n\r\n10                0.20 inch.\r\n\r\n11                0.16 inch.\r\n\r\nComparing the three lines together, it will be observed that the\r\nvelocity diminishes as we descend the glacier.  In 100 hours the\r\nmaximum motion of three lines respectively is as follows:\r\n\r\nMaximum Motion in 100 hours.\r\n\r\nLine A            56 inches\r\n\r\nLine B            45 inches.\r\n\r\nLine C            30 inches.\r\n\r\nThis deportment explains an appearance which must strike every\r\nobserver who looks upon the Morteratsch from the Piz Languard, or from\r\nthe new Bernina Road.  A medial moraine runs along the glacier,\r\ncommencing as a narrow streak, but towards the end the moraine\r\nextending in width, until finally it quite covers the terminal portion\r\nof the glacier.  The cause of this is revealed by the foregoing\r\nmeasurements, which prove that a stone on the moraine where it is\r\ncrossed by the line A approaches a second stone on the moraine where\r\nit is crossed by the line C with a velocity of twenty-six inches per\r\none hundred hours.  The moraine is in a state of longitudinal\r\ncompression.  Its materials are more and more squeezed together, and\r\nthey must consequently move laterally and render the moraine at the\r\nterminal portion of the glacier wider than above.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the Morteratsch glacier, then, diminishes as we descend.\r\nThe maximum motion of the third line is thirty inches in one hundred\r\nhours, or seven inches a day--a very slow motion; and had we run a\r\nline nearer to the end of the glacier, the motion would have been\r\nslower still.  At the end itself it is nearly insensible. [Footnote:\r\nThe snout of the Aletsch Glacier has a diurnal motion of less than two\r\ninches, while a mile or so above the snout the velocity is eighteen\r\ninches.  The spreading out of the moraine is here very striking.]  Now\r\nI submit that this is not the Place to seek for the scooping power of\r\na glacier.  The opinion appears to be prevalent that it is the snout\r\nof a glacier that must act the part of ploughshare; and it is\r\ncertainly an erroneous opinion.  The scooping power will exert itself\r\nmost where the weight and the motion are greatest. A glacier's snout\r\noften rests upon matter which has been scooped from the glacier's bed\r\nhigher up.  I therefore do not think that the inspection of what the\r\nend of a glacier does or does not accomplish can decide this question.\r\n\r\nThe snout of a glacier is potent to remove anything against which it\r\ncan fairly abut; and this power, notwithstanding the slowness of the\r\nmotion, manifests itself at the end of the Morteratsch glacier.  A\r\nhillock, bearing pine-trees, was in front of the glacier when Mr.\r\nHirst and myself inspected its end; and this hillock is being bodily\r\nremoved by the thrust of the ice.  Several of the trees are\r\noverturned; and in a few years, if the glacier continues its reputed\r\nadvance, the mound will certainly be ploughed away.\r\n\r\nThe question of Alpine conformation stands, I think, thus: We have,\r\nin the first place, great valleys, such as those of the Rhine and the\r\nRhone, which we might conveniently call valleys of the first order.\r\nThe mountains which flank these main valleys are also cut by lateral\r\nvalleys running into the main ones, and which may be called valleys of\r\nthe second order.  When these latter are examined, smaller valleys are\r\nfound running into them, which may be called valleys of the third\r\norder.  Smaller ravines and depressions, again, join the latter, which\r\nmay be called valleys of the fourth order, and so on until we reach\r\nstreaks and cuttings so minute as not to merit the name of valleys at\r\nall.  At the bottom of every valley we have a stream, diminishing in\r\nmagnitude as the order of the valley ascends, carving the earth and\r\ncarrying its materials to lower levels.  We find that the larger\r\nvalleys have been filled for untold ages by glaciers of enormous\r\ndimensions, always moving, grinding down and tearing away the rocks\r\nover which they passed.  We have, moreover, on the plains at the feet\r\nof the mountains, and in enormous quantities, the very matter derived\r\nfrom the sculpture of the mountains themselves.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Italy and Switzerland are cumbered by the _débris_ of the\r\nAlps.  The lower, wider, and more level valleys are also filled to\r\nunknown depths with the materials derived from the higher ones.  In\r\nthe vast quantities of moraine-matter which cumber many even of the\r\nhigher valleys we have also suggestions as to the magnitude of the\r\nerosion which has taken place.  This moraine-matter, moreover, can\r\nonly in small part have been derived from the falling of rocks upon\r\nthe ancient glacier; it is in great part derived from the grinding and\r\nthe ploughing-out of the glacier itself.  This accounts for the\r\nmagnitude of many of the ancient moraines, which date from a period\r\nwhen almost all the mountains were covered with ice and snow, and\r\nwhen, consequently, the quantity of moraine-matter derived from the\r\nnaked crests cannot have been considerable.\r\n\r\nThe erosion theory ascribes the formation of Alpine valleys to the\r\nagencies here briefly referred to.  It invokes nothing but true\r\ncauses.  Its artificers are still there, though, it may be, in\r\ndiminished strength; and if they are granted sufficient time, it is\r\ndemonstrable that they are competent to produce the effects ascribed\r\nto them.  And what does the fracture theory offer in comparison?  From\r\nno possible application of this theory, pure and simple, can we obtain\r\nthe slopes and forms of the mountains.  Erosion must in the long run\r\nbe invoked, and its power therefore conceded.  The fracture theory\r\ninfers from the disturbances of the Alps the existence of fissures;\r\nand this is a probable inference.  But that they were of a magnitude\r\nsufficient to produce the conformation of the Alps, and that they\r\nfollowed, as the Alpine valleys do, the lines of natural drainage of\r\nthe country, are assumptions which do not appear to me to be justified\r\neither by reason or by observation.\r\n\r\nThere is a grandeur in the secular integration of small effects\r\nimplied by the theory of erosion almost superior to that involved in\r\nthe idea of a cataclysm.  Think of the ages which must have been\r\nconsumed in the execution of this colossal sculpture.  The question\r\nmay, of course, be pushed further.  Think of the ages which the molten\r\nearth required for its consolidation.  But these vaster epochs lack\r\nsublimity through our inability to grasp them.  They bewilder us, but\r\nthey fail to make a solemn impression.  The genesis of the mountains\r\ncomes more within the scope of the intellect, and the majesty of the\r\noperation is enhanced by our partial ability to conceive it.  In the\r\nfalling of a rock from a mountain-head, in the shoot of an avalanche,\r\nin the plunge of a cataract, we often see more impressive\r\nillustrations of the power of gravity than in the motions of the\r\nstars.  When the intellect has to intervene, and calculation is\r\nnecessary to the building up of the conception, the expansion of the\r\nfeelings ceases to be proportional to the magnitude of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI will here record a few other measurements executed on the Rosegg\r\nglacier: the line was staked out across the trunk formed by the\r\njunction of the Rosegg proper with the Tschierva glacier, a short\r\ndistance below the rocky promontory called Agaliogs.\r\n\r\nRosegg Glacier.\r\n\r\nNo.  of Stake.

RECENT EXPERIMENTS ON FOG-SIGNALS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A discourse delivered in the Royal Institution, March 22,\r\n1878.]\r\n\r\nThe care of its sailors is one of the first duties of a maritime\r\npeople, and one of the sailor's greatest dangers is his proximity to\r\nthe coast at night.  Hence, the idea of warning him of such proximity\r\nby beacon-fires placed sometimes on natural eminences and sometimes on\r\ntowers built expressly for the purpose.  Close to Dover Castle, for\r\nexample, stands an ancient Pharos of this description.\r\n\r\nAs our marine increased greater skill was invoked, and lamps\r\nreinforced by parabolic reflectors poured their light upon the sea.\r\nSeveral of these lamps were sometimes grouped together so as to\r\nintensify the light, which at a little distance appeared as if it\r\nemanated from a single source.  This 'catoptric' form of apparatus is\r\nstill to some extent employed in our lighthouse-service, but for a\r\nlong time past it has been more and more displaced by the great lenses\r\ndevised by the illustrious Frenchman, Fresnel.\r\n\r\nIn a first-class 'dioptric' apparatus the light emanates from a lamp\r\nwith several concentric wicks, the flame of which, being kindled by a\r\nvery active draught, attains to great intensity.  In fixed lights the\r\nlenses refract the rays issuing from the lamp so as to cause them to\r\nform a luminous sheet which grazes the sea-horizon.  In revolving\r\nlights the lenses gather up the rays into distinct beams, resembling\r\nthe spokes of a wheel, which sweep over the sea and strike the eye of\r\nthe mariner in succession.\r\n\r\nIt is not for clear weather that the greatest strengthening of the\r\nlight is intended, for here it is not needed.  Nor is it for densely\r\nfoggy weather, for here it is ineffectual.  But it is for the\r\nintermediate stages of hazy, snowy, or rainy weather, in which a\r\npowerful light can assert itself, while a feeble one is extinguished.\r\nThe usual first-order lamp is one of four wicks, but Mr. Douglass, the\r\nable and indefatigable engineer of the Trinity House, has recently\r\nraised the number of the wicks to six, which produce a very noble\r\nflame.  To Mr. Wigham, of Dublin, we are indebted for the successful\r\napplication of gas to lighthouse illumination.  In some lighthouses\r\nhis power varies from 28 jets to 108 jets, while in the lighthouse of\r\nGalley Head three burners of the largest size can be employed, the\r\nmaximum number of jets being 324.  These larger powers are invoked\r\nonly in case of fog, the 28-jet burner being amply sufficient for\r\nclear weather.  The passage from the small burner to the large, and\r\nfrom the large burner to the small, is made with ease, rapidity, and\r\ncertainty.  This employment of gas is indigenous to Ireland, and the\r\nBoard of Trade has exercised a wise liberality in allowing every\r\nfacility to Mr. Wigham for the development of his invention.\r\n\r\nThe last great agent employed in lighthouse illumination is\r\nelectricity.  It was in this Institution, beginning in 1831, that\r\nFaraday proved the existence and illustrated the laws of those induced\r\ncurrents which in our day have received such astounding development.\r\nIn relation to this subject Faraday's words have a prophetic ring.  'I\r\nhave rather,' he writes in 1831, 'been desirous of discovering new\r\nfacts and new relations dependent on magneto-electric induction than\r\nof exalting the force of those already obtained, being assured that\r\nthe latter would find their full development hereafter.'  The labours\r\nof Holmes, of the Paris Alliance Company, of Wilde, and of Gramme,\r\nconstitute a brilliant fulfilment of this prediction.\r\n\r\nBut, as regards the augmentation of power, the greatest step hitherto\r\nmade was independently taken a few years ago by Dr. Werner Siemens and\r\nSir Charles Wheatstone.  Through the application of their discovery a\r\nmachine endowed with an infinitesimal charge of magnetism may, by a\r\nprocess of accumulation at compound interest, be caused so to enrich\r\nitself magnetically as to cast by its performance all the older\r\nmachines into the shade.  The light now before you is that of a small\r\nmachine placed downstairs, and worked there by a minute steam-engine.\r\nIt is a light of about 1000 candles; and for it, and for the\r\nsteam-engine that 'works it, our members are indebted to the\r\nliberality of Dr. William Siemens, who in the most generous manner has\r\npresented the machine to this Institution.  After an exhaustive trial\r\nat the South Foreland, machines on the principle of Siemens, but of\r\nfar greater power than this one, have been recently chosen by the\r\nElder Brethren of the Trinity House for the two light-houses at the\r\nLizard Point.\r\n\r\nOur most intense lights, including the six-wick lamp, the Wigham\r\ngas-light, and the electric light, being intended to aid the mariner\r\nin heavy weather, may be regarded, in a certain sense, as fog-signals.\r\nBut fog, when thick, is intractable to light.  The sun cannot\r\npenetrate it, much less any terrestrial source of illumination.  Hence\r\nthe necessity of employing sound-signals in dense fogs.  Bells, gongs,\r\nhorns, whistles, guns, and syrens have been used for this purpose; but\r\nit is mainly, if not wholly, with explosive signals that we have now\r\nto deal.  The gun has been employed with useful effect at the North\r\nStack, near Holyhead, on the Kish Bank near Dublin, at Lundy Island,\r\nand at other points on our coasts.  During the long, laborious, and I\r\nventure to think memorable series of observations conducted under the\r\nauspices of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House at the South\r\nForeland in 1872 and 1873, it was proved that a short 5.5-inch\r\nhowitzer, firing 3 lbs. of powder, yielded a louder report than a long\r\n18-pounder firing the same charge.  Here was a hint to be acted on by\r\nthe Elder Brethren.  The effectiveness of the sound depended on the\r\nshape of the gun, and as it could not be assumed that in the howitzer\r\nwe had hit accidentally upon the best possible shape, arrangements\r\nwere made with the War Office for the construction of a gun specially\r\ncalculated to produce the loudest sound attainable from the combustion\r\nof 3 lbs. of powder.  To prevent the unnecessary landward waste of the\r\nsound, the gun was furnished with a parabolic muzzle, intended to\r\nproject the sound over the sea, where it was most needed.  The\r\nconstruction of this gun was based on a searching series of\r\nexperiments executed at Woolwich with small models, provided with\r\nmuzzles of various kinds.  A drawing of the gun is annexed (p. 309).\r\nIt was constructed on the principle of the revolver, its various\r\nchambers being loaded and brought in rapid succession into the firing\r\nposition.  The performance of the gun proved the correctness of the\r\nprinciples on which its construction was based.\r\n\r\nAn incidental point of some interest was decided by the earliest\r\nWoolwich experiments.  It had been a widely spread opinion among\r\nartillerists, that a bronze gun produces a specially loud report.  I\r\ndoubted from the outset whether this would help us; and in a letter\r\ndated 22nd April, 1874, I ventured to express myself thus: 'The\r\nreport of a gun, as affecting an observer close at hand, is made up of\r\ntwo factors--the sound due to the shock of the air by the violently\r\nexpanding gas, and the sound derived from the vibrations of the gun,\r\nwhich, to some extent, rings like a bell.  This latter, I apprehend,\r\nwill disappear at considerable distances.'\r\n\r\nFIG.  8. Breech-loading Fog-signal Gun, with Bell Mouth, proposed by\r\nMajor Maitland, R.A. Assistant Superintendent. [Footnote: The carriage\r\nof this gun has been modified in construction since this drawing was\r\nmade.]\r\n\r\nThe result of subsequent trial, as reported by General Campbell, is,\r\n'that the sonorous qualities of bronze are greatly superior to those\r\nof cast iron at short distances, but that the advantage lies with the\r\nbaser metal at long ranges.' [Footnote: General Campbell assigns a\r\ntrue cause for this difference.  The ring of the bronze gun represents\r\nso much energy withdrawn from the explosive force of the gunpowder.\r\nFurther experiments would, however, be needed to place the superiority\r\nof the cast-iron gun at a distance beyond question.]\r\n\r\nCoincident with these trials of guns at Woolwich, gun-cotton was\r\nthought of as a probably effective sound-producer.  From the first,\r\nindeed, theoretic considerations caused me to fix my attention\r\npersistently on this substance; for the remarkable experiments of Mr.\r\nAbel, whereby its rapidity of combustion and violently explosive\r\nenergy are demonstrated, seemed to single it out as a substance\r\neminently calculated to fulfil the conditions necessary to the\r\nproduction of an intense wave of sound.  What those conditions are we\r\nshall now more particularly enquire, calling to our aid a brief but\r\nvery remarkable paper, published by Professor Stokes in the\r\n'Philosophical Magazine' for 1868.\r\n\r\nThe explosive force of gunpowder is known to depend on the sudden\r\nconversion of a solid body into an intensely heated gas.  Now the work\r\nwhich the artillerist requires the expanding gas to perform is the\r\ndisplacement of the projectile, besides which it has to displace the\r\nair in front of the projectile, which is backed by the whole pressure\r\nof the atmosphere.  Such, however, is not the work that we want our\r\ngunpowder to perform.  We wish to transmute its energy not into the\r\nmere mechanical translation of either shot or air, but into vibratory\r\nmotion.  We want _pulses_ to be formed which shall propagate themselves\r\nto vast distances through the atmosphere, and this requires a certain\r\nchoice and management of the explosive material.\r\n\r\nA sound-wave consists essentially of two parts--a condensation and a\r\nrarefaction.  Now air is a very mobile fluid, and if the shock\r\nimparted to it lack due promptness, the wave is not produced. Consider\r\nthe case of a common clock pendulum, which oscillates to and fro, and\r\nwhich might be expected to generate corresponding pulses in the air.\r\nWhen, for example, the bob moves to the right, the air to the right of\r\nit might be supposed to be condensed, while a partial vacuum might be\r\nsupposed to follow the bob.  As a matter of fact, we have nothing of\r\nthe kind.  The air particles in front of the bob retreat so rapidly,\r\nand those behind it close so rapidly in, that no sound-pulse is\r\nformed.  The mobility of hydrogen, moreover, being far greater than\r\nthat of air, a prompter action is essential to the formation of\r\nsonorous waves in hydrogen than in air.  It is to this rapid power of\r\nreadjustment, this refusal, so to speak, to allow its atoms to be\r\ncrowded together or to be drawn apart, that Professor Stokes, with\r\nadmirable penetration, refers the damping power, first described by\r\nSir John Leslie, of hydrogen upon sound.\r\n\r\nA tuning-fork which executes 256 complete vibrations in a second, if\r\nstruck gently on a pad and held in free air, emits a scarcely audible\r\nnote.  It behaves to some extent like the pendulum bob just referred\r\nto.  This feebleness is due to the prompt 'reciprocating flow' of the\r\nair between the incipient condensations and rarefactions, whereby the\r\nformation of sound-pulses is forestalled.  Stokes, however, has taught\r\nus that this flow may be intercepted by placing the edge of a card in\r\nclose proximity to one of the corners of the fork.  An immediate\r\naugmentation of the sound of the fork is the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe more rapid the shock imparted to the air, the greater is the\r\nfractional part of the energy of the shock converted into wave motion.\r\nAnd as different kinds of gunpowder vary considerably in their\r\nrapidity of combustion, it may be expected that they will also vary as\r\nproducers of sound.  This theoretic inference is completely verified\r\nby experiment.  In a series of preliminary trials conducted at\r\nWoolwich on the 4th of June, 1875, the sound-producing powers of four\r\ndifferent kinds of powder were determined.  In the order of the size\r\nof their grains they bear the names respectively of Fine-grain\r\n(F.G.), Large-grain (L.G.), Rifle Large-grain (R.L.G.), and\r\nPebble-powder (P.) (See annexed figures.) The charge in each case\r\namounted to 4.5 lbs. four 24-lb. howitzers being employed to fire the\r\nrespective charges.\r\n\r\nFIG.  9.\r\n\r\nThere were eleven observers, all of whom, without a single\r\ndissentient, pronounced the sound of the fine-grain powder loudest of\r\nall.  In the opinion of seven of the eleven the large-grain powder\r\ncame next; seven also of the eleven placed the rifle large-grain third\r\non the list; while they were again unanimous in pronouncing the\r\npebble-powder the worst sound-producer.  These differences are\r\nentirely due to differences in the rapidity of combustion.  All who\r\nhave witnessed the performance of the 80-ton gun must have been\r\nsurprised at the mildness of its thunder.  To avoid the strain\r\nresulting from quick combustion, the powder employed is composed of\r\nlumps far larger than those of the pebble-powder above referred to. In\r\nthe long tube of the gun these lumps of solid matter gradually resolve\r\nthemselves into gas, which on issuing from muzzle imparts a kind of\r\npush to the air, instead of the sharp shock necessary to form the\r\ncondensation of an intensely sonorous wave.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the physical reasons why guncotton might be regarded\r\nas a promising fog-signal.  Firing it as we have been taught to do by\r\nMr. Abel, its explosion is more rapid than that of gunpowder.  In its\r\ncase the air particles, alert as they are, will not, it might be\r\npresumed, be able to slip from condensation to rarefaction with a\r\nrapidity sufficient to forestall the formation of the wave.  On _à\r\npriori_ grounds then, we are entitled to infer the effectiveness of\r\ngun-cotton, while in a great number of comparative experiments,\r\nstretching from 1874 to the present time, this inference has been\r\nverified in the most conclusive manner.\r\n\r\nAs regards explosive material, and zealous and accomplished help in\r\nthe use of it, the resources of Woolwich Arsenal have been freely\r\nplaced at the disposal of the Elder Brethren.  General Campbell,\r\nGeneral Younghusband, Colonel Fraser, Colonel Maitland, and other\r\nofficers, have taken an active personal part in the investigation, and\r\nin most cases have incurred the labour of reducing and reporting on\r\nthe observations.  Guns of various forms and sizes have been invoked\r\nfor gunpowder, while gun-cotton has been fired in free air and in the\r\nfoci of parabolic reflectors.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February, 1875, a number of small guns, cast specially\r\nfor the purpose--some with plain, some with conical, and some with\r\nparabolic muzzles--firing 4 oz. of fine-grain powder, were pitted\r\nagainst 4 oz. of gun-cotton detonated both in the open, and in the\r\nfocus of a parabolic reflector. [Footnote: For charges of this\r\nweight the reflector is of moderate size, and may be employed without\r\nfear of fracture.]\r\n\r\nThe sound produced by the gun-cotton, reinforced by the reflector, was\r\nunanimously pronounced loudest of all.  With equal unanimity, the\r\ngun-cotton detonated in free air was placed second in intensity.\r\nThough the same charge was used throughout, the guns differed notably\r\namong themselves, but none of them came up to the gun-cotton, either\r\nwith or without the reflector.  A second series, observed from a\r\ndifferent distance on the same day, confirmed to the letter the\r\nforegoing result.\r\n\r\nAs a practical point, however, the comparative cost of gun-cotton and\r\ngunpowder has to be taken into account, though considerations of cost\r\nought not to be stretched too far in cases involving the safety of\r\nhuman life.  In the earlier experiments, where quantities of equal\r\nprice were pitted against each other, the results were somewhat\r\nfluctuating.  Indeed, the perfect manipulation of the gun-cotton\r\nrequired some preliminary discipline--promptness, certainty, and\r\neffectiveness of firing, augmenting as experience increased.  As 1 lb.\r\nof gun-cotton costs as much as 3 lbs. of gunpowder, these quantities\r\nwere compared together on the 22nd of February.  The guns employed to\r\ndischarge the gunpowder were a 12-lb.  brass howitzer, a 24-lb.\r\ncast-iron howitzer, and the long 18-pounder employed at the South\r\nForeland.  The result was, that the 24-lb. howitzer, firing 3 lbs. of\r\ngunpowder, had a slight advantage over 1 lb.  of gun-cotton detonated\r\nin the open; while the 12-lb.  howitzer and the 18-pounder were both\r\nbeaten by the gun-cotton.  On the end of May, on the other hand, the\r\ngun-cotton is reported as having been beaten by all the guns.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the parabolic-muzzle gun, expressly intended for\r\nfog-signalling, was pushed rapidly forward, and on March 22 and 23,\r\n1876, its power was tested at Shoeburyness.  Pitted against it were a\r\n16-pounder, a 5.5-inch howitzer, 1.5 lb.  of gun-cotton detonated in\r\nthe focus of a reflector (see annexed figure), and 1.5 lb. of\r\ngun-cotton detonated in free air.  On this occasion nineteen different\r\nseries of experiments were made, when the new experimental gun, firing\r\na 3-lb.  charge, demonstrated its superiority over all guns previously\r\nemployed to fire the same charge.  As regards the comparative merits\r\nof the gun-cotton fired in the open, and the gunpowder fired from the\r\nnew gun, the mean values of their sounds were the same.  Fired in the\r\nfocus of the reflector, the gun-cotton clearly dominated over all the\r\nother sound-producers. [Footnote: The reflector was fractured by the\r\nexplosion, but it did good service afterwards.]\r\n\r\nFIG.  10.\r\n\r\nGun-cotton Slab (1.5 lb.) Detonated in the Focus of a Cast-iron\r\nReflector.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the observations here referred to were embraced by an\r\nangle of about 70°, of which 50' lay on the one side and 20° on the\r\nother side of the line of fire.  The shots were heard by eleven\r\nobservers on board the 'Galatea,' which took up positions varying from\r\n2 miles to 13.5 miles from the firing-point.  In all these\r\nobservations, the reinforcing action of the reflector, and of the\r\nparabolic muzzle of the gun, came into play.  But the reinforcement of\r\nthe sound in one direction implies its withdrawal from some other\r\ndirection, and accordingly it was found that at a distance of 5.25\r\nmiles from the firing-point, and on a line including nearly an angle\r\nof 90° with the line of fire, the gun-cotton in the open beat the new\r\ngun; while behind the station, at distances of 8.5 miles and 13.5\r\nmiles respectively, the gun-cotton in the open beat both the gun and\r\nthe gun-cotton in the reflector.  This result is rendered more\r\nimportant by the fact that the sound reached the Mucking Light, a\r\ndistance of 13.5 miles, against a light wind which was blowing at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, of our ordinary sound-producers send forth waves\r\nwhich are not of uniform intensity throughout.  A trumpet is loudest\r\nin the direction of its axis.  The same is true of a gun.  A bell,\r\nwith its mouth pointed upwards or downwards, sends forth waves which\r\nare far denser in the horizontal plane passing through the bell than\r\nat an angular distance of 90° from that plane.  The oldest bellbangers\r\nmust have been aware of the fact that the sides of the bell, and not\r\nits mouth, emitted the strongest sound, their practice being probably\r\ndetermined by this knowledge.  Our slabs of gun-cotton also emit waves\r\nof different densities in different parts.  It has occurred in the\r\nexperiments at Shoeburyness that when the broad side of a slab was\r\nturned towards the suspending wire of a second slab six feet distant,\r\nthe wire was cut by the explosion, while when the edge of the slab was\r\nturned to the wire this never occurred.\r\n\r\nTo the circumstance that the broadsides of the slabs faced the sea is\r\nprobably to be ascribed the remarkable fact observed on March 23, that\r\nin two directions, not far removed from the line of fire, the\r\ngun-cotton detonated in the open had a slight advantage over the new\r\ngun.\r\n\r\nTheoretic considerations rendered it probable that the shape and size\r\nof the exploding mass would affect the constitution of the wave of\r\nsound.  I did not think large rectangular slabs the most favourable\r\nshape, and accordingly proposed cutting a large slab into fragments of\r\ndifferent sizes, and pitting them against each other The differences\r\nbetween the sounds were by no means so great as the differences in the\r\nquantities of explosive material might lead one to expect.  The mean\r\nvalues of eighteen series of observations made on board the 'Galatea,'\r\nat distances varying from 1.75 mile to 4.8 miles, were as follows:\r\n\r\nWeights          4 oz.  6 oz.  9 oz.  12 oz.\r\n\r\nValue of sound   3.12   3.34   4.0    4.03\r\n\r\nThese charges were cut from a slab of dry gun-cotton about 1.75 inch\r\nthick: they were squares and rectangles of the following dimensions:\r\n\r\n4 oz,           2 inches by 2 inches;\r\n\r\n6 oz,           2 inches by 3 inches;\r\n\r\n9 oz,           3 inches by 3 inches;\r\n\r\n12 oz,          2 inches by 6 inches.\r\n\r\nThe numbers under the respective weights express the recorded value of\r\nthe sounds.  They must be simply taken as a ready means of expressing\r\nthe approximate relative intensity of the sounds as estimated by the\r\near.  When we find a 9-oz. charge marked 4, and a 12-oz. charge marked\r\n4.03, the two sounds may be regarded as practically equal in\r\nintensity, thus proving that an addition of 30 per cent.  in the\r\nlarger charges produces no sensible difference in the sound.  Were the\r\nsounds estimated by some physical means, instead of by the ear, the\r\nvalues of the sounds at the distances recorded would not, in my\r\nopinion, show a greater advance with the increase of material than\r\nthat indicated by the foregoing numbers.  Subsequent experiments\r\nrendered still more certain the effectiveness, as well as the economy,\r\nof the smaller charges of gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nIt is an obvious corollary from the foregoing experiments that on our\r\n'nesses' and promontories, where the land is clasped on both sides for\r\na considerable distance by the sea--where, therefore, the sound has to\r\npropagate itself rearward as well as forward--the use of the parabolic\r\ngun, or of the parabolic reflector, might be a disadvantage rather\r\nthan an advantage.  Here guncotton, exploded in the open, forms the\r\nmost appropriate source of sound.  This remark is especially\r\napplicable to such lightships as are intended to spread the sound all\r\nround them as from central foci.\r\n\r\nAs a signal in rock lighthouses, where neither syren, steam-whistle,\r\nnor gun could be mounted; and as a handy fleet-signal, dispensing with\r\nthe lumber of special signal-guns, the gun-cotton will prove\r\ninvaluable.  But in most of these cases we have the drawback that\r\nlocal damage may be done by the explosion.  The lantern of the rock\r\nlighthouse might suffer from concussion near at hand, and though\r\nmechanical arrangements might be devised, both in the case of the\r\nlighthouse and of the ship's deck, to place the firing-point of the\r\ngun-cotton at a safe distance, no such arrangement could compete, as\r\nregards simplicity and effectiveness, with the expedient of a\r\ngun-cotton rocket.  Had such a means of signalling existed at the\r\nBishop's Rock lighthouse, the ill-fated 'Schiller' might have been\r\nwarned of her approach to danger ten, or it may be twenty, miles\r\nbefore she reached the rock which wrecked her.  Had the fleet\r\npossessed such a signal, instead of the ubiquitous but ineffectual\r\nwhistle, the 'Iron Duke' and 'Vanguard' need never have come into\r\ncollision.\r\n\r\nIt was the necessity of providing a suitable signal for rock\r\nlighthouses, and of clearing obstacles which cast an acoustic shadow,\r\nthat suggested the idea of the gun-cotton rocket to Sir Richard\r\nCollinson, Deputy Master of the Trinity House.  His idea was to place\r\na disk or short cylinder of gun-cotton in the head of a rocket, the\r\nascensional force of which should be employed to carry the disk to an\r\nelevation of 1000 feet or thereabouts, where by the ignition of a fuse\r\nassociated with a detonator, the gun-cotton should be fired, sending\r\nits sound in all directions vertically and obliquely down upon earth\r\nand sea.  The first attempt to realise this idea was made on July 18,\r\n1876, at the firework manufactory of the Messrs.  Brock, at Nunhead.\r\nEight rockets were then fired, four being charged with 5 oz. and four\r\nwith 7.5 oz. of gun-cotton.  They ascended to a great height, and\r\nexploded with a very loud report in the air.  On July 27, the rockets\r\nwere tried at Shoeburyness.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy result on this occasion was the hearing of the\r\nsounds at the Mouse Lighthouse, 8.5 miles E.  by S, and at the Chapman\r\nLighthouse, 8.5 miles W.  by N; that is to say, at opposite sides of\r\nthe firing-point.  It is worthy of remark that, in the case of the\r\nChapman Lighthouse, land and trees intervened between the firing-point\r\nand the place of observation.  This,' as General Younghusband justly\r\nremarked at the time, 'may prove to be a valuable consideration if it\r\nshould be found necessary to place a signal station in a position\r\nwhence the sea could not be freely observed.' Indeed, the clearing of\r\nsuch obstacles was one of the objects which the inventor of the rocket\r\nhad in view.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the action of the wind, it was thought desirable to\r\ncompare the range of explosions produced near the surface of the earth\r\nwith others produced at the elevation attainable by the gun-cotton\r\nrockets.  Wind and weather, however, are not at our command; and hence\r\none of the objects of a series of experiments conducted on December\r\n13, 1876, was not fulfilled.  It is worthy, however, of note that on\r\nthis day, with smooth water and a calm atmosphere, the rockets were\r\ndistinctly heard at a distance of 11.2 miles from the firing-point.\r\nThe quantity of gun-cotton employed was 7.5 oz. On Thursday, March 8,\r\n1877, these comparative experiments of firing at high and low\r\nelevations were pushed still further.  The gun-cotton near the ground\r\nconsisted of 0.5-lb. disks, suspended from a horizontal iron bar about\r\n4.5 feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nThe rockets carried the same quantity of gun-cotton in their heads,\r\nand the height to which they attained, as determined by a theodolite,\r\nwas from 800 to 900 feet.  The day was cold, with occasional squalls\r\nof snow and hail, the direction of the sound being at right angles to\r\nthat of the wind.  Five series of observations were made on board the\r\n'Vestal,' at distances varying from 3 to 6 miles.  The mean value of\r\nthe explosions in the air exceeded that of the explosions near the\r\nground by a small but sensible quantity.  At Windmill Hill, Gravesend,\r\nhowever, which was nearly to leeward, and 5.5 miles from the\r\nfiring-point, in nineteen cases out of twenty-four the disk fired near\r\nthe ground was loudest; while in the remaining five the rocket had the\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the day the atmosphere became very serene.  A few\r\ndistant cumuli sailed near the horizon, but the zenith and a vast\r\nangular space all round it were absolutely free from cloud.  From the\r\ndeck of the 'Galatea' a rocket was discharged, which reached a great\r\nelevation, and exploded with a loud report.  Following this solid\r\nnucleus of sound was a continuous train of echoes, which retreated to\r\na continually greater distance, dying gradually off into silence after\r\nseven seconds' duration.  These echoes were of the same character as\r\nthose so frequently noticed at the South Foreland in 1872-73, and\r\ncalled by me 'aerial echoes.'\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of March the experiments were resumed, the most noteworthy\r\nresults of that day's observations being that the sounds were heard at\r\nTillingham, 10 miles to the N.E.; at West Mersea, 15.75 miles to the\r\nN.E. by E; at Brightlingsea, 17.5 miles to the N.E.; and at Clacton\r\nWash, 20.5 miles to the N.E. by 1/2 E. The wind was blowing at the\r\ntime from the S.E.  Some of these sounds were produced by rockets,\r\nsome by a 24-lb.  howitzer, and some by an 8-inch Maroon.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1876, Mr. Gardiner, the managing director of the\r\nCotton-powder Company, had proposed a trial of this material against\r\nthe gun-cotton.  The density of the cotton he urged was only 1.03,\r\nwhile that of the powder was 1.70.  A greater quantity of explosive\r\nmaterial being thus compressed into the same volume, Mr. Gardiner\r\nthought that a greater sonorous effect must be produced by the powder.\r\nAt the instance of Mr. Mackie, who had previously gone very\r\nthoroughly into the subject, a Committee of the Elder Brethren visited\r\nthe cotton-powder manufactory, on the banks of the Swale, near\r\nFaversham, on the 16th of June, 1877.  The weights of cotton-powder\r\nemployed were 2 oz, 8 oz, 1 lb, and 2 lbs, in the form of rockets and\r\nof signals fired a few feet above the ground.  The experiments\r\nthroughout were arranged and conducted by Mr. Mackie.  Our desire on\r\nthis occasion was to get 'as near to windward as possible, but the\r\nSwale and other obstacles limited our distance to 1.5 mile.  We stood\r\nhere E.S.E. from the firing-point while the wind blew fresh from the\r\nN.E.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-powder yielded a very effective report.  The rockets in\r\ngeneral had a slight advantage over the same quantities of material\r\nfired near the ground.  The loudness of the sound was by no means\r\nproportional to the quantity of the material exploded, 8 oz. yielding\r\nvery nearly as loud a report as 1 lb.  The 'aerial echoes,' which\r\ninvariably followed the explosion of the rockets, were loud and\r\nlong-continued.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of October, 1877, another series of experiments with\r\nhowitzers and rockets was carried out at Shoeburyness.  The charge of\r\nthe howitzer was 3 lbs. of L. G. powder.  The charges of the rockets\r\nwere 12 oz, 8 oz, 4 oz, and 2 oz. of gun-cotton respectively.  The gun\r\nand the four rockets constituted a series, and eight series were fired\r\nduring the afternoon of the 17th.  The observations were made from the\r\n'Vestal' and the 'Galatea,' positions being successively assumed which\r\npermitted the sound to reach the observers with the Wind, against the\r\nwind, and across the wind.  The distance of the 'Galatea' varied from\r\n3 to 7 miles, that of the 'Vestal,' which was more restricted in her\r\nmovements, being 2 to 3 miles.  Briefly summed up, the result is that\r\nthe howitzer, firing a 3-lb.  charge, which it will be remembered was\r\nour best gun at 'the South Foreland, was beaten by the 12-oz. rocket,\r\nby the 8-oz. rocket, and by the 4-oz. rocket. The 2-oz. rocket alone\r\nfell behind the howitzer.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while recording the distances at which some of the sounds\r\nwere heard on the day now referred to:\r\n\r\n1.  Leigh         6.5 miles W.N.W.      24 out of 40 sounds heard.\r\n\r\n2.  Girdler       12 miles S.E. by E.    5 out of 40 sounds heard.\r\n    Light-vessel\r\n\r\n3.  Reculvers    171 miles S.E. by S.   18 out of 40 sounds heard.\r\n\r\n4.  St. Nicholas 20 miles S.E.           3 out of 40 sounds heard.\r\n\r\n5.  Epple Bay    22 miles S.E. by E.    19 out of 40 sounds heard.\r\n\r\n6.  Westgate     23 miles S.E. by E.     9 out of 40 sounds heard.\r\n\r\n7.  Kingsgate    25 miles S.E.  by E.    8 out of 40 sounds heard.\r\n\r\nThe day was cloudy, with occasional showers of drizzling rain; the\r\nwind about N.W. by N. all day; at times squally, rising to a force of\r\n6 or 7 and sometimes dropping to a force of 2 or 3.  The station at\r\nLeigh excepted, all these places were to leeward of Shoeburyness.  At\r\nfour other stations to leeward, varying in distance from 15.5 to 24.5\r\nmiles, nothing was heard, while at eleven stations to windward,\r\nvarying from 8 to 26 miles, the sounds were also inaudible.  It was\r\nfound, indeed, that the sounds proceeding directly against the wind\r\ndid not penetrate much beyond 3 miles.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, viz. the 18th October, we proceeded to Dungeness\r\nwith the view of making a series of strict comparative experiments\r\nwith gun-cotton and cotton-powder.  Rockets containing 8 oz, 4 oz, and\r\n2 oz. of gun-cotton had been prepared at the Royal Arsenal; while\r\nothers, containing similar quantities of cotton-powder, had been\r\nsupplied by the Cotton-powder Company at Faversham.  With these were\r\ncompared the ordinary 18-pounder gun, which happened to be mounted at\r\nDungeness, firing the usual charge of 3 lbs. of powder, and a syren.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments it appeared that the guncotton and\r\ncotton-powder were practically equal as producers of sound.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of small charges was illustrated in a very striking\r\nmanner, only a single unit separating the numerical value of the 8-oz.\r\nrocket from that of the 2-oz. rocket.  The former was recorded as 6.9\r\nand the latter as 5.9, the value of the 4-oz. rocket being\r\nintermediate between them.  These results were recorded by a number of\r\nvery practised observers on board the 'Galatea.' They were completely\r\nborne out by the observations of the Coastguard, who marked the value\r\nof the 8-oz rocket 6-1, and that of the 2-oz. rocket 5.2.  The\r\n18-pounder gun fell far behind all the rockets, a result, possibly, to\r\nbe in part ascribed to the imperfection of the powder.  The\r\nperformance of the syren was, on the whole, less satisfactory than\r\nthat of the rocket.  The instrument was worked, not by steam of 70\r\nlbs. pressure, as at the South Foreland, but by compressed air,\r\nbeginning with 40 lbs. and ending with 30 lbs. pressure.  The trumpet\r\nwas pointed to windward, and in the axis of the instrument the sound\r\nwas about as effective as that of the 8-oz. rocket.  But in a\r\ndirection at right angles to the axis, and still more in the rear of\r\nthis direction, the syren fell very sensibly behind even the 2-oz.\r\nrocket.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal comparative trials made between the gun-cotton\r\nrocket and other fog-signals; but they are not the only ones.  On the\r\n2nd of August, 1877, for example, experiments were made at Lundy\r\nIsland with the following results.  At 2 miles distant from the\r\nfiring-point, with land intervening, the 18-pounder, firing a 3-lb.\r\ncharge, was quite unheard.  Both the 4-oz. rocket and the 8-oz.\r\nrocket, however, reached an elevation which commanded the acoustic\r\nshadow, and yielded loud reports.  When both were in view the rockets\r\nwere still superior to the gun.  On the 6th of August, at St. Ann's,\r\nthe 4-oz. and 8-oz. rockets proved superior to the syren.  On the\r\nShambles Light-vessel, when a pressure of 13 lbs. was employed to\r\nsound the syren, the rockets proved greatly superior to that\r\ninstrument.  Proceeding along the sea margin at Flamboro' Head, Mr.\r\nEdwards states that at a distance of 1.25 mile, with the 18-pounder\r\npreviously used as a fog-signal hidden behind the cliffs, its report\r\nwas quite unheard, while the 4-oz. rocket, rising to an elevation\r\nwhich brought it clearly into view, yielded a powerful sound in the\r\nface of an opposing wind.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of February 9th, 1877, a remarkable series of\r\nexperiments were made by Mr. Prentice at Stowmarket with the\r\ngun-cotton rocket.  From the report with which he has kindly furnished\r\nme I extract the following particulars.  The first column in the\r\nannexed statement contains the name of the place of observation, the\r\nsecond its distance from the firing-point, and the third the result\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\nStoke Hill, Ipswich  10 miles Rockets clearly seen and sounds\r\ndistinctly heard 53 seconds after the flash.\r\n\r\nMelton               15 miles Signals distinctly heard.  Thought at\r\n                              first that sounds were reverberated\r\n                              from the sea.\r\n\r\nFramlingham          18 miles Signals very distinctly heard, both in\r\n                              the open air and in a closed room.\r\n                              Wind in favour of sound.\r\n\r\nStratford.           19 miles St. Andrews Reports loud; startled\r\n                              pheasants  in a cover close by.\r\n\r\nTuddenham.           10 miles St. Martin Reports very loud; rolled\r\n                              away like thunder.\r\n\r\nChrist Church Park.  11 miles Report arrived a little more than a\r\n                              minute after flash.\r\n\r\nNettlestead Hall      6 miles Distinct in every part of observer's\r\n                              house.  Very loud in the open air.\r\n\r\nBildestone            6 miles Explosion very loud, wind against sound.\r\n\r\nNacton               14 miles Reports quite distinct--mistaken by\r\n                              inhabitants for claps of thunder.\r\n\r\nAldboro'             25 miles Rockets seen through a very hazy\r\n                              atmosphere; a rumbling detonation heard.\r\n\r\nCapel Mills          11 miles Reports heard within and without the\r\n                              observer's house.  Wind opposed to sound.\r\n\r\nLawford              15.5 miles Reports distinct: attributed to\r\n                                distant thunder.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of these cases, the direction of the sound\r\nenclosed a large angle with the direction of the wind.  In some cases,\r\nindeed, the two directions were at right angles to each other.  It is\r\nneedless to dwell for a moment on the advantage of possessing a signal\r\ncommanding ranges such as these.\r\n\r\nThe explosion of substances in the air, after having been carried to a\r\nconsiderable elevation by rockets, is a familiar performance.  In\r\n1873, moreover, the Board of Trade proposed a light-and-sound rocket\r\nas a signal of distress, which proposal was subsequently realized, but\r\nin a form too elaborate and expensive for practical use.  The idea of\r\na gun-cotton rocket fit for signalling in fogs is, I believe, wholly\r\ndue to Sir Richard Collinson, the Deputy Master of the Trinity House.\r\nThanks to the skilful aid given by the authorities of Woolwich, by Mr.\r\nPrentice, and Mr. Brock, that idea is now an accomplished fact; a\r\nsignal of great power, handiness, and economy, being thus placed at\r\nthe service of our mariners.  Not only may the rocket be applied in\r\nassociation with lighthouses and lightships, but in the Navy also it\r\nmay be turned to important account.  Soon after the loss of the\r\n'Vanguard' I ventured to urge upon an eminent naval officer the\r\ndesirability of having an organized code of fog-signals for the fleet.\r\nHe shook his head doubtingly, and referred to the difficulty of\r\nfinding room for signal guns.  The gun-cotton rocket completely\r\nsurmounts this difficulty, It is manipulated with ease and rapidity,\r\nwhile its discharges may be so grouped and combined as to give a most\r\nimportant extension to the voice of the admiral in command.  It is\r\nneedless to add that at any point upon our coasts, or upon any other\r\ncoast, where its establishment might be desirable, a fog-signal\r\nstation might be extemporised without difficulty.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI have referred more than once to the train of echoes which\r\naccompanied the explosion of gun-cotton in free air, speaking of them\r\nas similar in all respects to those which were described for the first\r\ntime in my Report on Fog-signals, addressed to the Corporation of\r\nTrinity House in 1874. [Footnote: See also 'Philosophical\r\nTransactions' for 1874, p. 183.]  To these echoes I attached a\r\nfundamental significance.  There was no visible reflecting surface\r\nfrom which they could come.  On some days, with hardly a cloud in the\r\nair and hardly a ripple on the sea, they reached a magical intensity.\r\nAs far as the sense of hearing could judge, they came from the body of\r\nthe air in front of the great trumpet which produced them.  The\r\ntrumpet blasts were five seconds in duration, but long before the\r\nblast had ceased the echoes struck in, adding their strength to the\r\nprimitive note of the trumpet.  After the blast had ended the echoes\r\ncontinued, retreating further and further from the point of\r\nobservation, and finally dying away at great distances.  The echoes\r\nwere perfectly continuous as long as the sea was clear of ships,\r\n'tapering' by imperceptible gradations into absolute silence.  But\r\nwhen a ship happened to throw itself athwart the course of the sound,\r\nthe echo from the broadside of the vessel was returned as a shock\r\nwhich rudely interrupted the continuity of the dying atmospheric\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nThese echoes have been ascribed to reflection from the crests of the\r\nsea-waves.  But this hypothesis is negatived by the fact, that the\r\nechoes were produced in great intensity and duration when no waves\r\nexisted--when the sea, in fact, was of glassy smoothness.  It has been\r\nalso shown that the direction of the echoes depended not on that of\r\nwaves, real or assumed, but on the direction of the axis of the\r\ntrumpet.  Causing that axis to traverse an arc of 210°, and the\r\ntrumpet to sound at various points of the arc, the echoes were always,\r\nat all events in calm weather, returned from that portion of the\r\natmosphere towards which the trumpet was directed.  They could not,\r\nunder the circumstances, come from the glassy sea; while both their\r\nvariation of direction and their perfectly continuous fall into\r\nsilence, are irreconcilable with the notion that they came from fixed\r\nobjects on the land.  They came from that portion of the atmosphere\r\ninto which the trumpet poured its maximum sound, and fell in intensity\r\nas the direct sound penetrated to greater atmospheric distances.\r\n\r\nThe day on which our latest observations were made was particularly\r\nfine.  Before reaching Dungeness, the smoothness of the sea and the\r\nserenity of the air caused me to test the echoing power of the\r\natmosphere.  A single ship lay about half a mile distant between us\r\nand the land.  The result of the proposed experiment was clearly\r\nforeseen.  It was this.  The rocket being sent up, it exploded at a\r\ngreat height; the echoes retreated in their usual fashion, becoming\r\nless and less intense as the distances of the invisible surfaces of\r\nreflection from the observers increased.  About five seconds after the\r\nexplosion, a single loud shock was sent back to us from the side of\r\nthe vessel lying between us and the land.  Obliterated for a moment by\r\nthis more intense echo the aerial reverberation continued its retreat,\r\ndying away into silence in two or three seconds afterwards. [Footnote:\r\nThe echoes of the gun fired on shore this day were very brief; those\r\nof the 12-oz. gun-cotton rocket were 12\" and those of the 8-oz.\r\ncotton-powder rocket 11\" in duration.]\r\n\r\nI have referred to the firing of an 8-oz. rocket from the deck of the\r\n'Galatea' on March 8, 1877, stating the duration of its echoes to be\r\nseven seconds.  Mr. Prentice, who was present at the time, assured me\r\nthat in his experiments similar echoes had been frequently heard of\r\nmore than twice this duration.  The ranges of his sounds alone would\r\nrender this result in the highest degree probable.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to interpret an experiment which I have not had an\r\nopportunity of repeating, is an operation of some risk; and it is not\r\nwithout a consciousness of this that I refer here to a result\r\nannounced by Professor Joseph Henry, which he considers adverse to the\r\nnotion of aerial echoes.  He took the trouble to point the trumpet of\r\na syren towards the zenith, and found that when the syren was sounded\r\nno echo was returned.  Now the reflecting surfaces which give rise to\r\nthese echoes are for the most part due to differences of temperature\r\nbetween sea and air.  If, through any cause, the air above be chilled,\r\nwe have descending streams--if the air below be warmed, we have\r\nascending streams as the initial cause of atmospheric flocculence.  A\r\nsound proceeding vertically does not cross the streams, nor impinge\r\nupon the reflecting surfaces, as does a sound proceeding horizontally\r\nacross them.  Aerial echoes, therefore, will not accompany the\r\nvertical sound as they accompany the horizontal one.  The experiment,\r\nas I interpret it, is not opposed to the theory of these echoes which\r\nI have ventured to enunciate.  But, as I have indicated, not only to\r\nsee but to vary such an experiment is a necessary prelude to grasping\r\nits full significance.\r\n\r\nIn a paper published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1876,\r\nProfessor Osborne Reynolds refers to these echoes in the following\r\nterms Without attempting to explain the reverberations and echoes\r\nwhich have been observed, I will merely call attention to the fact\r\nthat in no case have I heard any attending the reports of the rockets,\r\n[Footnote: These carried 12 oz. of gunpowder, which has been found by\r\nCol. Fraser to require an iron case to produce an effective\r\nexplosion.]  although they seem to have been invariable with the guns\r\nand pistols.  These facts suggest that the echoes are in some way\r\nconnected with the direction given to the sound.  They are caused by\r\nthe voice, trumpets, and the syren, all of which give direction to the\r\nsound; but I am not aware that they have ever been observed in the\r\ncase of a sound which has no direction of greatest intensity.' The\r\nreference to the voice, and other references in his paper, cause me to\r\nthink that, in speaking of echoes, Professor Osborne Reynolds and\r\nmyself are dealing with different phenomena.  Be that as it may, the\r\nforegoing observations render it perfectly certain that the condition\r\nas to direction here laid down is not necessary to the production of\r\nthe echoes.\r\n\r\nThere is not a feature connected with the aerial echoes which cannot\r\nbe brought out by experiments in the air of the laboratory.  I have\r\nrecently made the following experiment: A rectangle, x Y (p. 331),\r\n22 inches by 12, was crossed by twenty-three brass tubes (half the\r\nnumber would suffice and only eleven are shown in the figure), each\r\nhaving a slit along it from which gas can issue.  In this way\r\ntwenty-three low flat flames were obtained.  A sounding reed a fixed\r\nin a short tube was placed at one end of the rectangle, and a\r\n'sensitive flame,' [Footnote: Fully described in my 'Lectures on\r\nSound,' 3rd edition, p. 227.]  f, at some distance beyond the other\r\nend.  When the reed sounded, the flame in front of it was violently\r\nagitated, and roared boisterously.  Turning on the gas, and lighting\r\nit as it issued from the slits, the air above the flames became so\r\nheterogeneous that the sensitive flame was instantly stilled, rising\r\nfrom a height of 6 inches to a height of 18 inches.  Here we had the\r\nacoustic opacity of the air in front of the South Foreland strikingly\r\nimitated. [Footnote: Lectures on Sound, 3rd ed, p. 268.]  Turning off\r\nthe gas, and removing the sensitive flame to f, some distance behind\r\nthe reed, it burned there tranquilly, though the reed was sounding.\r\nAgain lighting the gas as it issued from the brass tubes, the sound\r\nreflected from the heterogeneous air threw the sensitive flame into\r\nviolent agitation.  Here we had imitated the aerial echoes heard when\r\nstanding behind the syren-trumpet at the South Foreland. The\r\nexperiment is extremely simple, and in the highest degree impressive.\r\n\r\nFig.  11.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe explosive rapidity of dynamite marks it as a substance specially\r\nsuitable for the production of sound.  At the suggestion of Professor\r\nDewar, Mr. McRoberts has carried out a series of experiments on\r\ndynamite, with extremely promising results.  Immediately after the\r\ndelivery of the foregoing lecture I was informed that Mr. Brock\r\nproposed the employment of dynamite in the Collinson rocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXI.  ON THE STUDY OF PHYSICS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a lecture delivered in the Royal Institution of Great\r\nBritain in the Spring of 1854.]\r\n\r\nI HOLD in my hand an uncorrected proof of the syllabus of this course\r\nof lectures, and the title of the present lecture A there stated to be\r\n'On the Importance of the Study of Physics as a Means of Education.'\r\nThe corrected proof, however, contains the title: 'On the Importance\r\nof the Study of Physics as a Branch of Education.' Small as this\r\neditorial alteration may seem, the two words suggest two radically\r\ndistinct modes of viewing the subject before us.  The term Education\r\nis sometimes applied to a single faculty or organ, and if we know\r\nwherein the education of a single faculty consists, this will help us\r\nto clearer notions regarding the education of the sum of all the\r\nfaculties, or of the mind.  When, for example, we speak of the\r\neducation of the voice, what do we mean?  There are certain membranes\r\nat the top of the windpipe which throw into vibration the air forced\r\nbetween them from the lungs, thus producing musical sounds.  These\r\nmembranes are, to some extent, under the control of the will, and it\r\nis found that they can be so modified by exercise as to produce notes\r\nof a clearer and more melodious character.  This exercise we call the\r\neducation of the voice.  We may choose for our exercise songs new or\r\nold, festive or solemn; the education of the voice being the object\r\naimed at, the songs may be regarded as the means by which this\r\neducation is accomplished.  I think this expresses the state of the\r\ncase more clearly than if we were to call the songs a branch of\r\neducation.  Regarding also the education of the human mind as the\r\nimprovement and development of the mental faculties, I shall consider\r\nthe study of Physics as a means towards the attainment of this end.\r\nFrom this point of view, I degrade Physics into an implement of\r\nculture, and this is my deliberate design.\r\n\r\nThe term Physics, as made use of in the present Lecture, refers to\r\nthat portion of natural science which lies midway between astronomy\r\nand chemistry.  The former, indeed, is Physics applied to 'masses of\r\nenormous weight,' while the latter is Physics applied to atoms and\r\nmolecules.  The subjects of Physics proper are therefore those which\r\nlie nearest to human perception: light and heat, colour, sound,\r\nmotion, the loadstone, electrical attractions and repulsions, thunder\r\nand lightning, rain, snow, dew, and so forth.  Our senses stand\r\nbetween these phenomena and the reasoning mind.  We observe the fact,\r\nbut are not satisfied with the mere act of observation: the fact must\r\nbe accounted for--fitted into its position in the line of cause and\r\neffect.  Taking our facts from Nature we transfer them to the domain\r\nof thought: look at them, compare them, observe their mutual relations\r\nand connexions, and bringing them ever clearer before the mental eye,\r\nfinally alight upon the cause which unites them.  This is the last act\r\nof the mind, in this centripetal direction--in its progress from the\r\nmultiplicity of facts to the central cause on which they depend.  But,\r\nhaving guessed the cause, we are not yet contented.  We set out from\r\nthe centre and travel in the other direction.  If the guess be true,\r\ncertain consequences must follow from it, and we appeal to the law and\r\ntestimony of experiment whether the thing is so.  Thus is the circuit\r\nof thought completed,--from without inward, from multiplicity to\r\nunity, and from within outward, from unity to multiplicity.  In thus\r\ntraversing both ways the line between cause and effect, all our\r\nreasoning powers are called into play.  The mental effort involved in\r\nthese processes may be compared to those exercises of the body which\r\ninvoke the co-operation of every muscle, and thus confer upon the\r\nwhole frame the benefits of healthy action.\r\n\r\nThe first experiment a child makes is a physical experiment: the\r\nsuction-pump is but an imitation of the first act of every new-born\r\ninfant.  Nor do I think it calculated to lessen that infant's\r\nreverence, or to make him a worse citizen, when his riper experience\r\nshows him that the atmosphere was his helper in extracting the first\r\ndraught from his mother's breast. The child grows, but is still an\r\nexperimenter: he grasps at the moon, and his failure teaches him to\r\nrespect distance.  At length his little fingers acquire sufficient\r\nmechanical tact to lay hold of a spoon.  He thrusts the instrument\r\ninto his mouth, hurts his gums, and thus learns the impenetrability of\r\nmatter.  He lets the spoon fall, and jumps with delight to hear it\r\nrattle against the table.  The experiment made by accident is repeated\r\nwith intention, and thus the young student receives his first lessons\r\nupon sound and gravitation.  There are pains and penalties, however,\r\nin the path of the enquirer: he is sure to go wrong, and Nature is\r\njust as sure to inform him of the fact.  He falls downstairs, burns\r\nhis fingers, cuts his hand, scalds his tongue, and in this way learns\r\nthe conditions of his physical well being.  This is Nature's way of\r\nproceeding, and it is wonderful what progress her pupil makes.  His\r\nenjoyments for a time are physical, and the confectioner's shop\r\noccupies the foreground of human happiness; but the blossoms of a\r\nfiner life are already beginning to unfold themselves, and the\r\nrelation of cause and effect dawns upon the boy.  He begins to see\r\nthat the present condition of things is not final, but depends upon\r\none that has gone before, and will be succeeded by another.  He\r\nbecomes a puzzle to himself; and to satisfy his newly-awakened\r\ncuriosity, asks all manner of inconvenient questions.  The needs and\r\ntendencies of human nature express themselves through these early\r\nyearnings of the child.  As thought ripens, he desires to know the\r\ncharacter and causes of the phenomena presented to his observation;\r\nand unless this desire has been granted for the express purpose of\r\nhaving it repressed, unless the attractions of natural phenomena be\r\nlike the blush of the forbidden fruit, conferred merely for the\r\npurpose of exercising our self-denial in letting them alone; we may\r\nfairly claim for the study of Physics the recognition that it answers\r\nto an impulse implanted by nature in the constitution of man.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, a Master of Arts, who is still a young man, and\r\ntherefore the recipient of a modern education, stated to me that until\r\nhe had reached the age of twenty years he had never been taught\r\nanything whatever regarding natural phenomena, or natural law.  Twelve\r\nyears of his life previously had been spent exclusively among the\r\nancients.  The case, I regret to say, is typical.  Now, we cannot,\r\nwithout prejudice to humanity, separate the present from the past. The\r\nnineteenth century strikes its roots into the centuries gone by, and\r\ndraws nutriment from them.  The world cannot afford to lose the record\r\nof any great deed or utterance; for such are prolific throughout all\r\ntime.  We cannot yield the companionship of our loftier brothers of\r\nantiquity,--of our Socrates and Cato,--whose lives provoke us to\r\nsympathetic greatness across the interval of two thousand years.  As\r\nlong as the ancient languages are the means of access to the ancient\r\nmind, they must ever be of priceless value to humanity; but surely\r\nthese avenues might be kept open without making such sacrifices as\r\nthat above referred to, universal.  We have conquered and possessed\r\nourselves of continents of land, concerning which antiquity knew\r\nnothing; and if new continents of thought reveal themselves to the\r\nexploring human spirit, shall we not possess them also?  In these\r\nlatter days, the study of Physics has given us glimpses of the methods\r\nof Nature which were quite hidden from the ancients, and we should be\r\nfalse to the trust committed to us, if we were to sacrifice the hopes\r\nand aspirations of the Present out of deference to the Past.\r\n\r\nThe bias of my own education probably manifests itself in a desire I\r\nalways feel to seize upon every possible opportunity of checking my\r\nassumptions and conclusions by experience.  In the present case, it is\r\ntrue, your own consciousness might be appealed to in proof of the\r\ntendency of the human mind to inquire into the phenomena presented to\r\nit by the senses; but I trust you will excuse me if, instead of doing\r\nthis, I take advantage of the facts which have fallen in my way\r\nthrough life, referring to your judgment to decide whether such facts\r\nare truly representative and general, and not merely individual and\r\nlocal.\r\n\r\nAt an agricultural college in Hampshire, with which I was connected\r\nfor some time, and which is now converted into a school for the\r\ngeneral education of youth, a Society was formed among the boys, who\r\nmet weekly for the purpose of reading reports and papers upon various\r\nsubjects.  The Society had its president and treasurer; and abstracts\r\nof its proceedings were published in a little monthly periodical\r\nissuing from the school press.  One of the most remarkable features of\r\nthese weekly meetings was, that after the general business had been\r\nconcluded, each member enjoyed the right of asking questions on any\r\nsubject on which he desired information.  The questions were either\r\nwritten out previously in a book, or, if a question happened to\r\nsuggest itself during the meeting, it was written upon a slip of paper\r\nand handed in to the Secretary, who afterwards read all the questions\r\naloud.  A number of teachers were usually present, and they and the\r\nboys made a common stock of their wisdom in furnishing replies.  As\r\nmight be expected from an assemblage of eighty or ninety boys, varying\r\nfrom eighteen to eight years old, many odd questions were proposed. To\r\nthe mind which loves to detect in the tendencies of the young the\r\ninstincts of humanity generally, such questions are not without a\r\ncertain philosophic interest, and I have therefore thought it not\r\nderogatory to the present course of Lectures to copy a few of them,\r\nand to introduce them here.  They run as follows:\r\n\r\nWhat are the duties of the Astronomer Royal?\r\n\r\nWhat is frost?\r\n\r\nWhy are thunder and lightning more frequent in summer than in winter?\r\n\r\nWhat occasions falling stars?\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of the sensation called 'pins and needles '?\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of waterspouts?\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of hiccup?\r\n\r\nIf a towel be wetted with water, why does the wet portion become\r\ndarker than before?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Lancashire witches?\r\n\r\nDoes the dew rise or fall?\r\n\r\nWhat is the principle of the hydraulic press?\r\n\r\nIs there more oxygen in the air in summer than in winter?\r\n\r\nWhat are those rings which we see round the gas and sun?\r\n\r\nWhat is thunder?\r\n\r\nHow is it that a black hat can be moved by forming round it a magnetic\r\ncircle, while a white hat remains stationary?\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of perspiration?\r\n\r\nIs it true that men were once monkeys?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between the soul and the mind?\r\n\r\nIs it contrary to the rules of Vegetarianism to eat eggs?\r\n\r\nIn looking over these questions, which were wholly unprompted, and\r\nhave been copied almost at random from the book alluded to, we see\r\nthat many of them are suggested directly by natural objects, and are\r\nnot such as had an interest conferred on them' by previous culture.\r\nNow the fact is beyond the boy's control, and so certainly is the\r\ndesire to know its cause.  The sole question then is, whether this\r\ndesire is to be gratified or not.  Who created the fact?  Who\r\nimplanted the desire?  Certainly not man.  Who then will undertake to\r\nplace himself between the desire and its fulfilment, and proclaim a\r\ndivorce between them?  Take, for example, the case of the wetted\r\ntowel, which at first sight appears to be one of the most unpromising\r\nquestions in the list. Shall we tell the proposer to repress his\r\ncuriosity, as the subject is improper for him to know, and thus\r\ninterpose our wisdom to rescue the boy from the consequences of a wish\r\nwhich acts to his prejudice?  Or, recognising the propriety of the\r\nquestion, how shall we answer it?  It is impossible to answer it\r\nwithout reference to the laws of optics--without making the boy to\r\nsome extent a natural philosopher.  You may say that the effect is due\r\nto the reflection of light at the common surface of two media of\r\ndifferent refractive indices.  But this answer presupposes on the part\r\nof the boy a knowledge of what reflection and refraction are, or\r\nreduces you to the necessity of explaining them.\r\n\r\nOn looking more closely into the matter, we find that our wet towel\r\nbelongs to a class of phenomena which have long excited the interest\r\nof philosophers.  The towel is white for the same reason that snow is\r\nwhite, that foam is white, that pounded granite or glass is white, and\r\nthat the salt we use at table is white.  On quitting one medium and\r\nentering another, a portion of light is always reflected, but on this\r\ncondition--the media must possess different refractive indices. Thus,\r\nwhen we immerse a bit of glass in water, light is reflected from the\r\ncommon surface of both, and it is this light which enables us to see\r\nthe glass.  But when a transparent solid is immersed in a liquid of\r\nthe same refractive index as itself, it immediately disappears.  I\r\nremember once dropping the eyeball of an ox into water; it vanished as\r\nif by magic, with the exception of the crystalline lens, and the\r\nsurprise was so great as to cause a bystander to suppose that the\r\nvitreous humour had been instantly dissolved.  This, however, was not\r\nthe case, and a comparison of the refractive index of the humour with\r\nthat of water cleared up the whole matter.  The indices were\r\nidentical, and hence the light pursued its way through both as if they\r\nformed one continuous mass.\r\n\r\nIn the case of snow, powdered quartz, or salt, we have a transparent\r\nsolid mixed with air.  At every transition from solid to air, or\r\nfrom air to solid, a portion of light is reflected, and this takes\r\nplace so often that the light is wholly intercepted.  Thus from the\r\nmixture of two transparent bodies we obtain an opaque one.  Now the\r\ncase of the towel is precisely similar.  The tissue is composed of\r\nsemi-transparent vegetable fibres, with the interstices between them\r\nfilled with air; repeated reflection takes place at the limiting\r\nsurfaces of air and fibre, and hence the towel becomes opaque like\r\nsnow or salt.  But if we fill the interstices with water, we diminish\r\nthe reflection; a portion of the light is transmitted, and the\r\ndarkness of the towel is due to its increased transparency.  Thus the\r\ndeportment of various minerals, such as hydrophane and tabasheer, the\r\ntransparency of tracing paper used by engineers, and many other\r\nconsiderations of the highest scientific interest, are involved in the\r\nsimple enquiry of this unsuspecting little boy.\r\n\r\nAgain, take the question regarding the rising or falling of the dew--a\r\nquestion long agitated, and finally set at rest by the beautiful\r\nresearches of Wells.  I do not think that any boy of average\r\nintelligence will be satisfied with the simple answer that the dew\r\nfalls.  He will wish to learn how you know that it falls, and, if\r\nacquainted with the notions of the middle ages, he may refer to the\r\nopinion of Father Laurus, that a goose egg filled in the morning with\r\ndew and exposed to the sun, will rise like a balloon--a swan's egg\r\nbeing better for the experiment than a goose egg.  It is impossible to\r\ngive the boy a clear notion of the beautiful phenomenon to which his\r\nquestion refers, without first making him acquainted with the\r\nradiation and conduction of heat.  Take, for example, a blade of\r\ngrass, from which one of these orient pearls is depending.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the grass, and the earth beneath it, possess a certain\r\namount of warmth imparted by the sun; during a serene night, heat is\r\nradiated from the surface of the grass into space, and to supply the\r\nloss, there is a flow of heat from the earth to the blade.  Thus the\r\nblade loses heat by radiation, and gains heat by conduction.  Now, in\r\nthe case before us, the power of radiation is great, whereas the power\r\nof conduction is small; the consequence is that the blade loses more\r\nthan it gains, and hence becomes more and more refrigerated.  The\r\nlight vapour floating around the surface so cooled is condensed upon\r\nit, and there accumulates to form the little pearly globe which we\r\ncall a dew-drop.\r\n\r\nThus the boy finds the simple and homely fact which addressed his\r\nsenses to be the outcome and flower of the deepest laws.  The fact\r\nbecomes, in a measure, sanctified as an object of thought, and\r\ninvested for him with a beauty for evermore.  He thus learns that\r\nthings which, at first sight, seem to stand isolated and without\r\napparent brotherhood in Nature are organically united, and finds the\r\ndetection of such analogies a source of perpetual delight.  To enlist\r\npleasure on the side of intellectual performance is a point of the\r\nutmost importance; for the exercise of the mind, like that of the\r\nbody, depends for its value upon the spirit in which it is\r\naccomplished.  Every physician knows that something more than mere\r\nmechanical motion is comprehended under the idea of healthful\r\nexercise--that, indeed, being most healthful which makes us forget all\r\nulterior ends in the mere enjoyment of it.  What, for example, could\r\nbe substituted for the action of the playground, where the boy plays\r\nfor the mere love of playing, and without reference to physiological\r\nlaws; while kindly Nature accomplishes her ends unconsciously, and\r\nmakes his very indifference beneficial to him.  You may have more\r\nsystematic motions, you may devise means for the more perfect traction\r\nof each particular muscle, but you cannot create the joy and gladness\r\nof the game, and where these are absent, the charm and the health of\r\nthe exercise are gone.  The case is similar with the education of the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe study of Physics, as already intimated, consists of two processes,\r\nwhich are complementary to each other--the tracing of facts to their\r\ncauses, and the logical advance from the cause to the fact.  In the\r\nformer process, called _induction_, certain moral qualities come into\r\nplay.  The first condition of success is patient industry, an honest\r\nreceptivity, and a willingness to abandon all preconceived notions,\r\nhowever cherished, if they be found to contradict the truth.  Believe\r\nme, a self-renunciation which has something lofty in it, and of which\r\nthe world never hears, is often enacted in the private experience of\r\nthe true votary of science.  And if a man be not capable of this\r\nself-renunciation--this loyal surrender of himself to Nature and to\r\nfact, he lacks, in my opinion, the first mark of a true philosopher.\r\n\r\nThus the earnest prosecutor of science, who does not work with the\r\nidea of producing a sensation in the world, who loves the truth better\r\nthan the transitory blaze of to-day's fame, who comes to his task with\r\na single eye, finds in that task an indirect means of the highest\r\nmoral culture.  And although the virtue of the act depends upon its\r\nprivacy, this sacrifice of self, this upright determination to accept\r\nthe truth, no matter how it may present itself--even at the hands of a\r\nscientific foe, if necessary--carries with it its own reward.  When\r\nprejudice is put under foot and the stains of personal bias have been\r\nwashed away--when a man consents to lay aside his vanity and to become\r\nNature's organ--his elevation is the instant consequence of his\r\nhumility.\r\n\r\nI should not wonder if my remarks provoked a smile, for they seem to\r\nindicate that I regard the man of science as a heroic, if not indeed\r\nan angelic, character; and cases may occur to you which indicate the\r\nreverse.  You may point to the quarrels of scientific men, to their\r\nstruggles for priority, to that unpleasant egotism which screams\r\naround its little property of discovery like a scared plover about its\r\nyoung.  I will not deny all this; but let it be set down to its proper\r\naccount, to the weakness--or, if you will--to the selfishness of Man,\r\nbut not to the charge of Physical Science.\r\n\r\nThe second process in physical investigation is _deduction_, or the\r\nadvance of the mind from fixed principles to the conclusions which\r\nflow from them.  The rules of logic are the formal statement of this\r\nprocess, which, however, was practised by every healthy mind before\r\never such rules were written.  In the study of Physics, induction and\r\ndeduction are perpetually wedded to each other.  The man observes,\r\nstrips facts of their peculiarities of form, and tries to unite them\r\nby their essences; having effected this, he at once deduces, and thus\r\nchecks his induction.\r\n\r\nHere the grand difference between the methods at present followed, and\r\nthose of the ancients, becomes manifest. They were one-sided in these\r\nmatters: they omitted the process of induction, and substituted\r\nconjecture for observation.  They could never, therefore, fulfil the\r\nmission of Man to 'replenish the earth, and subdue it.' The\r\nsubjugation of Nature is only to be accomplished by the penetration of\r\nher secrets and the patient mastery of her laws.  This not only\r\nenables us to protect ourselves from the hostile action of natural\r\nforces, but makes them our slaves.  By the study of Physics we have\r\nindeed opened to us treasuries of power of which antiquity never\r\ndreamed.  But while we lord it over Matter, we have thereby become\r\nbetter acquainted with the laws of Mind; for to the mental philosopher\r\nthe study of Physics furnishes a screen against which the human spirit\r\nprojects its own image, and thus becomes capable of self-inspection.\r\n\r\nThus, then, as a means of intellectual culture, the study of Physics\r\nexercises and sharpens observation: it brings the most exhaustive\r\nlogic into play: it compares, abstracts, and generalizes, and provides\r\na mental scenery appropriate to these processes.  The strictest\r\nprecision of thought is everywhere enforced, and prudence, foresight,\r\nand sagacity are demanded.  By its appeals to experiment, it\r\ncontinually checks itself, and thus walks on a foundation of facts.\r\nHence the exercise it invokes does not end in a mere game of\r\nintellectual gymnastics, such as the ancients delighted in, but tends\r\nto the mastery of Nature.  This gradual conquest of the external\r\nworld, and the consciousness of augmented strength which accompanies\r\nit, render the study of Physics as delightful as it is important.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the effect on the imagination, certain it is that the\r\ncool results of physical induction furnish conceptions which transcend\r\nthe most daring flights of that faculty.  Take for example the idea of\r\nan all-pervading aether which transmits a tingle, so to speak, to the\r\nfinger ends of the universe every time a street lamp is lighted.  The\r\ninvisible billows of this aether can be measured with the same ease\r\nand certainty as that with which an engineer measures a base and two\r\nangles, and from these finds the distance across the Thames.  Now it\r\nis to be confessed that there may be just as little poetry in the\r\nmeasurement of an aethereal undulation as in that of the river; for\r\nthe intellect, during the acts of measurement and calculation,\r\ndestroys those notions of size which appeal to the poetic sense.  It\r\nis a mistake to suppose, with Dr. Young, that\r\n\r\n    An undevout astronomer is mad;\r\n\r\nthere being no necessary connexion between a devout state of mind and\r\nthe observations and calculations of a practical astronomer.  It is\r\nnot until the man withdraws from his calculation, as a painter from\r\nhis work, and thus realizes the great idea on which he has been\r\nengaged, that imagination and wonder are excited.  There is, I admit,\r\na possible danger here.  If the arithmetical processes of science be\r\ntoo exclusively pursued, they may impair the imagination, and thus the\r\nstudy of Physics is open to the same objection as philological,\r\ntheological, or political studies, when carried to excess.  But even\r\nin this case, the injury done is to the investigator himself: it does\r\nnot reach the mass of mankind.  Indeed, the conceptions furnished by\r\nhis cold unimaginative reckonings may furnish themes for the poet, and\r\nexcite in the highest degree that sentiment of wonder which,\r\nnotwithstanding all its foolish vagaries, table-turning included, I,\r\nfor my part, should be sorry to see banished from the world.\r\n\r\nI have thus far dwelt upon the study of Physics as an agent of\r\nintellectual culture; but like other things in Nature, this study\r\nsubserves more than a single end.  The colours of the clouds delight\r\nthe eye, and, no doubt, accomplish moral purposes also, but the\r\nselfsame clouds hold within their fleeces the moisture by which our\r\nfields are rendered fruitful.  The sunbeams excite our interest and\r\ninvite our investigation; but they also extend their beneficent\r\ninfluences to our fruits and corn, and thus accomplish, not only\r\nintellectual ends, but minister, at the same time, to our material\r\nnecessities.  And so it is with scientific research.\r\n\r\nWhile the love of science is a sufficient incentive to the pursuit of\r\nscience, and the investigator, in the prosecution of his enquiries, is\r\nraised above all material considerations, the results of his labours\r\nmay exercise a potent influence upon the physical condition of the\r\ncommunity.  This is the arrangement of Nature, and not that of the\r\nscientific investigator himself; for he usually pursues his object\r\nwithout regard to its practical applications.\r\n\r\nAnd let him who is dazzled by such applications--who sees in the\r\nsteam-engine and the electric telegraph the highest embodiment of\r\nhuman genius and the only legitimate object of scientific research,\r\nbeware of prescribing conditions to the investigator.  Let him beware\r\nof attempting to substitute for that simple love with which the votary\r\nof science pursues his task, the calculations of what he is pleased to\r\ncall utility.  The professed utilitarian is unfortunately, in most\r\ncases, the very last man to see the occult sources from which useful\r\nresults are derived.  He admires the flower, but is ignorant of the\r\nconditions of its growth.  The scientific man must approach Nature in\r\nhis own way; for if you invade his freedom by your so-called practical\r\nconsiderations, it may be at the expense of those qualities on which\r\nhis success as a discoverer depends.  Let the self-styled practical\r\nman look to those from the fecundity of whose thought be, and\r\nthousands like him, have sprung into existence.  Were they inspired in\r\ntheir first enquiries by the calculations of utility?  Not one of\r\nthem.  They were often forced to live low and lie hard, and to seek\r\ncompensation for their penury in the delight which their favourite\r\npursuits afforded them.\r\n\r\nIn the words of one well qualified to speak upon this subject, 'I say\r\nnot merely look at the pittance of men like John Dalton, or the\r\nvoluntary starvation of the late Graff; but compare what is considered\r\nas competency or affluence by your Faradays, Liebigs, and Herschels,\r\nwith the expected results of a life of successful commercial\r\nenterprise: then compare the amount of mind put forth, the work done\r\nfor society in either case, and you will be constrained to allow that\r\nthe former belong to a class of workers who, properly speaking, are\r\nnot paid, and cannot be paid for their work, as indeed it is of a sort\r\nto which no payment could stimulate.'\r\n\r\nBut while the scientific investigator, standing upon the frontiers of\r\nhuman knowledge, and aiming at the conquest of fresh soil from the\r\nsurrounding region of the unknown, makes the discovery of truth his\r\nexclusive object for the time, he cannot but feel the deepest interest\r\nin the practical application of the truth discovered.  There is\r\nsomething ennobling in the triumph of Mind over Matter.  Apart even\r\nfrom its uses to society, there is something elevating in the idea of\r\nMan having tamed that wild force which flashes through the telegraphic\r\nwire, and made it the minister of his will.  Our attainments in these\r\ndirections appear to be commensurate with our needs.  We had already\r\nsubdued horse and mule, and obtained from them all the service which\r\nit was in their power to render: we must either stand still, or find\r\nmore potent agents to execute our purposes.  At this point the\r\nsteam-engine appears.  These are still new things; it is not long\r\nsince we struck into the scientific methods which have produced these\r\nresults.  We cannot for an instant regard them as the final\r\nachievements of Science, but rather as an earnest of what she is yet\r\nto do.  They mark our first great advances upon the dominion of\r\nNature.  Animal strength fails, but here are the forces which hold the\r\nworld together, and the instincts and successes of Man assure him that\r\nthese forces are his when he is wise enough to command them.\r\n\r\nAs an instrument of intellectual culture, the study of Physics is\r\nprofitable to all: as bearing upon special functions, its value,\r\nthough not so great, is still more tangible.  Why, for example, should\r\nMembers of Parliament be ignorant of the subjects concerning which\r\nthey are called upon to legislate?  In this land of practical physics,\r\nwhy should they be unable to form an independent opinion upon a\r\nphysical question?  Why should the member of a parliamentary committee\r\nbe left at the mercy of interested disputants when a scientific\r\nquestion is discussed, until he deems the nap a blessing which rescues\r\nhim from the bewilderments of the committee-room?  The education which\r\ndoes not supply the want here referred to, fails in its duty to\r\nEngland.  With regard to our working people, in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe term working, the study of Physics would, I imagine, be\r\nprofitable, not only as a means of intellectual culture, but also as a\r\nmoral influence to woo them from pursuits which now degrade them.  A\r\nman's reformation oftener depends upon the indirect, than upon the\r\ndirect action of the will.  The will must be exerted in the choice of\r\nemployment which shall break the force of temptation by erecting a\r\nbarrier against it.  The drunkard, for example, is in a perilous\r\ncondition if he content himself merely with saying, or swearing, that\r\nhe will avoid strong drink.  His thoughts, if not attracted by another\r\nforce, will revert to the public-house, and to rescue him permanently\r\nfrom this, you must give him an equivalent.\r\n\r\nBy investing the objects of hourly intercourse with an interest which\r\nprompts reflection, new enjoyments would be opened to the working man,\r\nand every one of these would be a point of force to protect him\r\nagainst temptation.  Besides this, our factories and our foundries\r\npresent an extensive field of observation, and were those who work in\r\nthem rendered capable, by previous culture, of _observing_ what they\r\nsee, the results might be incalculable.  Who can say what intellectual\r\nSamsons are at the present moment toiling with closed eyes in the\r\nmills and forges of Manchester and Birmingham?  Grant these Samsons\r\nsight, and you multiply the chances of discovery, and with them the\r\nprospects of national advancement.  In our multitudinous technical\r\noperations we are constantly playing with forces our ignorance of\r\nwhich is often the cause of our destruction.  There are agencies at\r\nwork in a locomotive of which the maker of it probably never dreamed,\r\nbut which nevertheless may be sufficient to convert it into an engine\r\nof death.  When we reflect on the intellectual condition of the people\r\nwho work in our coal mines, those terrific explosions which occur from\r\ntime to time need not astonish us.  If these men possessed sufficient\r\nphysical knowledge, from the operatives themselves would probably\r\nemanate a system by which these shocking accidents might be avoided.\r\nPossessed of the knowledge, their personal interests would furnish the\r\nnecessary stimulus to its practical application, and thus two ends\r\nwould be served at the same time the elevation of the men and the\r\ndiminution of the calamity.\r\n\r\nBefore the present Course of Lectures was publicly announced, I had\r\nmany misgivings as to the propriety of my taking a part in them,\r\nthinking that my place might be better filled by an older and more\r\nexperienced man.  To my experience, however, such as it was, I\r\nresolved to adhere, and I have therefore described things as they\r\nrevealed themselves to my own eyes, and have been enacted in my own\r\nlimited practice.  There is one mind common to us all; and the true\r\nexpression of this mind, even in small particulars, will attest itself\r\nby the response which it calls forth in the convictions of my hearers.\r\nI ask your permission to proceed a little further in this fashion, and\r\nto refer to a fact or two in addition to those already cited, which\r\npresented themselves to my notice during my brief career as a teacher\r\nin the college already alluded to.  The facts, though extremely\r\nhumble, and deviating in some slight degree from the strict subject of\r\nthe present discourse, may yet serve to illustrate an educational\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nOne of the duties which fell to my share was the instruction of a\r\nclass in mathematics, and I usually found that Euclid and the ancient\r\ngeometry generally, when properly and sympathetically addressed to the\r\nunderstanding, formed a most attractive study for youth.  But it was\r\nmy habitual practice to withdraw the boys from the routine of the\r\nbook, and to appeal to their self-power in the treatment of questions\r\nnot comprehended in that routine.  At first, the change from the\r\nbeaten track usually excited aversion: the youth felt like a child\r\namid strangers; but in no single instance did this feeling continue.\r\nWhen utterly disheartened, I have encouraged the boy by the anecdote\r\nof Newton, where he attributes the difference between him and other\r\nmen, mainly to his own patience; or of Mirabeau, when he ordered his\r\nservant, who had stated something to be impossible, never again to use\r\nthat blockhead of a word.  Thus cheered, the boy has returned to his\r\ntask with a smile, which perhaps had something of doubt in it, but\r\nwhich, nevertheless, evinced a resolution to try again.  I have seen\r\nhis eye brighten, and, at length, with a pleasure of which the ecstasy\r\nof Archimedes was but a simple expansion, heard him exclaim, 'I have\r\nit, sir.' The consciousness of self-power, thus awakened, was of\r\nimmense value; and, animated by it, the progress of the class was\r\nastonishing.  It was often my custom to give the boys the choice of\r\npursuing their propositions in the book, or of trying their strength\r\nat others not to be found there.  Never in a single instance was the\r\nbook chosen.  I was ever ready to assist when help was needful, but my\r\noffers of assistance were habitually declined.  The boys had tasted\r\nthe sweets of intellectual conquest and demanded victories of their\r\nown.  Their diagrams were scratched on the walls, cut into the beams\r\nupon the playground, and numberless other illustrations were afforded\r\nof the living interest they took in the subject.  For my own part, as\r\nfar as experience in teaching goes, I was a mere fledgling--knowing\r\nnothing of the rules of pedagogics, as the Germans name it; but\r\nadhering to the spirit indicated at the commencement of this\r\ndiscourse, and endeavouring to make geometry a means rather than a\r\nbranch of education.  The experiment was successful, and some of the\r\nmost delightful hours of my existence have been spent in marking the\r\nvigorous and cheerful expansion of mental power, when appealed to in\r\nthe manner here described.\r\n\r\nOur pleasure was enhanced when we applied our mathematical knowledge\r\nto the solution of physical problems.  Many objects of hourly contact\r\nhad thus a new interest and significance imparted to them.  The swing,\r\nthe see-saw, the tension of the giant-stride ropes, the fall and\r\nrebound of the football, the advantage of a small boy over a large one\r\nwhen turning short, particularly in slippy weather; all became\r\nsubjects of investigation.  A lady stands before a looking-glass, of\r\nher own height; it was required to know how much of the glass was\r\nreally useful to her?  We learned with pleasure the economic fact that\r\nshe might dispense with the lower half and see her whole figure\r\nnotwithstanding.  It was also pleasant to prove by mathematics, and\r\nverify by experiment, that the angular velocity of a reflected beam is\r\ntwice that of the mirror which reflects it.  From the hum of a bee we\r\nwere able to determine the number of times the insect flaps its wings\r\nin a second.  Following up our researches upon the pendulum, we\r\nlearned how Colonel Sabine had made it the means of determining the\r\nfigure of the earth; and we were also startled by the inference which\r\nthe pendulum enabled us to draw, that if the diurnal velocity of the\r\nearth were seventeen times its present amount, the centrifugal force\r\nat the equator would be precisely equal to the force of gravitation,\r\nso that an inhabitant of those regions would then have the same\r\ntendency to fall upwards as downwards.  All these things were sources\r\nof wonder and delight to us: and when we remembered that we were\r\ngifted with the powers which had reached such results, and that the\r\nsame great field was ours to work in, our hopes arose that at some\r\nfuture day we might possibly push the subject a little further, and\r\nadd our own victories to the conquests already won.\r\n\r\nI ought to apologise to you for dwelling so long upon this subject;\r\nbut the days spent among these young philosophers made a deep\r\nimpression on me.  I learned among them something of myself and of\r\nhuman nature, and obtained some notion of a teacher's vocation.  If\r\nthere be one profession in England of paramount importance, I believe\r\nit to be that of the schoolmaster; and if there be a position where\r\nselfishness and incompetence do most serious mischief, by lowering the\r\nmoral tone and exciting irreverence and cunning where reverence and\r\nnoble truthfulness ought to be the feelings evoked, it is that of the\r\nprincipal of a school.  When a man of enlarged heart and mind comes\r\namong boys, when he allows his spirit to stream through them, and\r\nobserves the operation of his own character evidenced in the elevation\r\nof theirs,--it would be idle to talk of the position of such a man\r\nbeing honourable.  It is a blessed position.  The man is a blessing to\r\nhimself and to all around him.  Such men, I believe, are to be found\r\nin England, and it behoves those who busy themselves with the\r\nmechanics of education at the present day, to seek them out.  For no\r\nmatter what means of culture may be chosen, whether physical or\r\nphilological, success must ever mainly depend upon the amount of life,\r\nlove, and earnestness, which the teacher himself brings with him to\r\nhis vocation.\r\n\r\nLet me again, and finally, remind you that the claims of that science\r\nwhich finds in me to-day its unripened advocate, are those of the\r\nlogic of Nature upon the reason of her child--that its disciplines, as\r\nan agent of culture, are based upon the natural relations subsisting\r\nbetween Man and the universe of which he forms a part.  On the one\r\nside, we have the apparently lawless shifting of phenomena; on the\r\nother side, mind, which requires law for its equilibrium, and through\r\nits own indestructible instincts, as well as through the teachings of\r\nexperience, knows that these phenomena are reducible to law.  To\r\nchasten this apparent chaos is a problem which man has set before him.\r\nThe world was built in order: and to us are trusted the will and power\r\nto discern its harmonies, and to make them the lessons of our lives.\r\nFrom the cradle to the grave we are surrounded with objects which\r\nprovoke inquiry.  Descending for a moment from this high plea to\r\nconsiderations which lie closer to us as a nation--as a land of gas\r\nand furnaces, of steam and electricity: as a land which science,\r\npractically applied, has made great in peace and mighty in war: I ask\r\nyou whether this 'land of old and just renown' has not a right to\r\nexpect from her institutions a culture more in accordance with her\r\npresent needs than that supplied by declension and conjugation?  And\r\nif the tendency should be to lower the estimate of science, by\r\nregarding it exclusively as the instrument of material prosperity, let\r\nit be the high mission of our universities to furnish the proper\r\ncounterpoise by pointing out its nobler uses--lifting the national\r\nmind to the contemplation of it as the last development of that\r\n'increasing purpose' which runs through the ages and widens the\r\nthoughts of men.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXII.  ON CRYSTALLINE AND SLATY CLEAVAGE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a discourse delivered in the Royal Institution of\r\nGreat Britain, June 6, 1856.]\r\n\r\nWHEN the student of physical science has to investigate the character\r\nof any natural force, his first care must be to purify it from the\r\nmixture of other forces, and thus study its simple action.  If, for\r\nexample, he wishes to know how a mass of liquid would shape itself if\r\nat liberty to follow the bent of its own molecular forces, he must see\r\nthat these forces have free and undisturbed exercise.  We might\r\nperhaps refer him to the dewdrop for a solution of the question; but\r\nhere we have to do, not only with the action of the molecules of the\r\nliquid upon each other, but also with the action of gravity upon the\r\nmass, which pulls the drop downwards and elongates it.  If he would\r\nexamine the problem in its purity, he must do as Plateau has done,\r\ndetach the liquid mass from the action of gravity; he would then find\r\nthe shape to be a perfect sphere.  Natural processes come to us in a\r\nmixed manner, and to the uninstructed mind are a mass of\r\nunintelligible confusion.  Suppose half-a-dozen of the best musical\r\nperformers to be placed in the same room, each playing his own\r\ninstrument to perfection, but no two playing the same tune; though\r\neach individual instrument might be a source of perfect music, still\r\nthe mixture of all would produce mere noise.\r\n\r\nThus it is with the processes of nature, where mechanical and\r\nmolecular laws intermingle and create apparent confusion.  Their\r\nmixture constitutes what may be called the _noise_ of natural laws, and\r\nit is the vocation of the man of science to resolve this noise into\r\nits components, and thus to detect the underlying music.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of this detachment of one force from all other forces is\r\nnowhere more strikingly exhibited than in the phenomena of\r\ncrystallisation.  Here, for example, is a solution of common sulphate\r\nof soda or Glauber salt.  Looking into it mentally, we see the\r\nmolecules of that liquid, like disciplined squadrons under a governing\r\neye, arranging themselves into battalions, gathering round distinct\r\ncentres, and forming themselves into solid masses, which after a time\r\nassume the visible shape of the crystal now held in my hand.  I may,\r\nlike an ignorant meddler wishing to hasten matters, introduce\r\nconfusion into this order.  This may be done by plunging a glass rod\r\ninto the vessel; the consequent action is not the pure expression of\r\nthe crystalline forces; the molecules rush together with the confusion\r\nof an unorganised mob, and not with the steady accuracy of a\r\ndisciplined host. In this mass of bismuth also we have an example of\r\nconfused crystallisation; but in the crucible behind me a slower\r\nprocess is going on: here there is an architect at work 'who makes no\r\nchips, no din,' and who is now building the particles into crystals,\r\nsimilar in shape and structure to those beautiful masses which we see\r\nupon the table.  By permitting alum to crystallise in this slow way,\r\nwe obtain these perfect octahedrons; by allowing carbonate of lime to\r\ncrystallise, nature produces these beautiful rhomboids; when silica\r\ncrystallises, we have formed these hexagonal prisms capped at the ends\r\nby pyramids; by allowing saltpetre to crystallise we have these\r\nprismatic masses, and when carbon crystallises, we have the diamond.\r\nIf we wish to obtain a perfect crystal we must allow the molecular\r\nforces free play; if the crystallising mass be permitted to rest upon\r\na surface it will be flattened, and to prevent this a small crystal\r\nmust be so suspended as to be surrounded on all sides by the liquid,\r\nor, if it rest upon the surface, it must be turned daily so as to\r\npresent all its faces in succession to the working builder.\r\n\r\nIn building up crystals these little atomic bricks often arrange\r\nthemselves into layers which are perfectly parallel to each other, and\r\nwhich can be separated by mechanical means; this is called the\r\ncleavage of the crystal.  The crystal of sugar I hold in my hand has\r\nthus far escaped the solvent and abrading forces which sooner or later\r\ndetermine the fate of sugar-candy.  I readily discover that it cleaves\r\nwith peculiar facility in one direction.  Again I lay my knife upon\r\nthis piece of rocksalt, and with a blow cleave it in one direction.\r\nLaying the knife at right angles to its former position, the crystal\r\ncleaves again; and finally placing the knife at right angles to the\r\ntwo former positions, we find a third cleavage.  Rocksalt cleaves in\r\nthree directions, and the resulting solid is this perfect cube, which\r\nmay be broken up into any number of smaller cubes.  Iceland spar also\r\ncleaves in three directions, not at right angles, but oblique to each\r\nother, the resulting solid being a rhomboid.  In each of these cases\r\nthe mass cleaves with equal facility in all three directions.  For the\r\nsake of completeness I may say that many crystals cleave with unequal\r\nfacility in different directions: heavy spar presents an example of\r\nthis kind of cleavage.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to the consideration of some other phenomena to which the\r\nterm cleavage may be applied.  Beech, deal, and other woods cleave\r\nwith facility along the fibre, and this cleavage is most perfect when\r\nthe edge of the axe is laid across the rings which mark the growth of\r\nthe tree.  If you look at this bundle of hay severed from a rick, you\r\nwill see a sort of cleavage in it also; the stalks lie in horizontal\r\nplanes, and only a small force is required to separate them laterally.\r\nBut we cannot regard the cleavage of the tree as the same in character\r\nas that of the hayrick.  In the one case it is the molecules arranging\r\nthemselves according to organic laws which produce a cleavable\r\nstructure, in the other case the easy separation in one direction is\r\ndue to the mechanical arrangement of the coarse sensible stalks of\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nThis sandstone rock was once a powder held in mechanical suspension by\r\nwater.  The powder was composed of two distinct parts, fine grains of\r\nsand and small plates of mica.  Imagine a wide strand covered by a\r\ntide, or an estuary with water which holds such powder in suspension:\r\nhow will it sink?  The rounded grains of sand will reach the bottom\r\nfirst, because they encounter least resistance, the mica afterwards,\r\nand when the tide recedes we have the little plates shining like\r\nspangles upon the surface of the sand.  Each successive tide brings\r\nits charge of mixed powder, deposits its duplex layer day after day,\r\nand finally masses of immense thickness are piled up, which by\r\npreserving the alternations of sand and mica tell the tale of their\r\nformation.  Take the sand and mica, mix them together in water, and\r\nallow them to subside; they will arrange themselves in the manner\r\nindicated, and by repeating the process you can actually build up a\r\nmass which shall be the exact counterpart of that presented by nature.\r\nNow this structure cleaves with readiness along the planes in which\r\nthe particles of mica are strewn.  Specimens of such a rock sent to me\r\nfrom Halifax, and other masses from the quarries of Over Darwen in\r\nLancashire, are here before you.  With a hammer and chisel I can\r\ncleave them into flags; indeed these flags are employed for roofing\r\npurposes in the districts from which the specimens have come, and\r\nreceive the name of 'slatestone.' But you will discern without a word\r\nfrom me, that this cleavage is not a crystalline cleavage any more\r\nthan that of a hayrick is.  It is molar, not molecular.\r\n\r\nThis, so far as I am aware of, has never been imagined, and it has\r\nbeen agreed among geologists not to call such splitting as this\r\ncleavage at all, but to restrict the term to a phenomenon of a totally\r\ndifferent character.\r\n\r\nThose who have visited the slate quarries of Cumberland and North\r\nWales will have witnessed the phenomenon to which I refer.  We have\r\nlong drawn our supply of roofing-slates from such quarries;\r\nschool-boys ciphered on these slates, they were used for tombstones in\r\nchurchyards, and for billiard-tables in the metropolis; but not until\r\na comparatively late period did men begin to enquire how their\r\nwonderful structure was produced.  What is the agency which enables us\r\nto split Honister Crag, or the cliffs of Snowdon, into laminae from\r\ncrown to base?  This question is at the present moment one of the\r\ngreat difficulties of geologists, and occupies their attention perhaps\r\nmore than any other.  You may wonder at this.  Looking into the quarry\r\nof Penrhyn, you may be disposed to offer the explanation I heard given\r\ntwo years ago.  'These planes of cleavage,' said a friend who stood\r\nbeside me on the quarry's edge, 'are the planes of stratification\r\nwhich have been lifted by some convulsion into an almost vertical\r\nposition.' But this was a mistake, and indeed here lies the grand\r\ndifficulty of the problem.  The planes of cleavage stand in most cases\r\nat a high angle to the bedding.  Thanks to Sir Roderick Murchison, I\r\nam able to place the proof of this before you.  Here is a specimen of\r\nslate in which both the planes of cleavage and of bedding are\r\ndistinctly marked, one of them making a large angle with the other.\r\nThis is common.  The cleavage of slates then is not a question of\r\nstratification; what then is its cause?\r\n\r\nIn an able and elaborate essay published in 1835, Prof. Sedgwick\r\nproposed the theory that cleavage is due to the action of crystalline\r\nor polar forces subsequent to the consolidation of the rock.  'We may\r\naffirm,' he says, 'that no retreat of the parts, no contraction of\r\ndimensions in passing to a solid state, can explain such phenomena.\r\nThey appear to me only resolvable on the supposition that crystalline\r\nor polar forces acted upon the whole mass simultaneously in one\r\ndirection and with adequate force.'  And again, in another place:\r\n'Crystalline forces have re-arranged whole mountain masses, producing\r\na beautiful crystalline cleavage, passing alike through all the\r\nstrata.' [Footnote: Transactions of the Geological Society, ser. ii,\r\nvol. iii. p. 477.]\r\n\r\nThe utterance of such a man struck deep, as it ought to do, into the\r\nminds of geologists, and at the present day there are few who do not\r\nentertain this view either in whole or in part. [Footnote: In a letter\r\nto Sir Charles Lyell, dated from the Cape of Good Hope February 20,\r\n1836, Sir John Herschel writes as follows: 'If rocks have been so\r\nheated as to allow of a commencement of crystallisation, that is to\r\nsay, if they have been heated to a point at which the particles can\r\nbegin to move amongst themselves, or at least on their own axes, some\r\ngeneral law must then determine the position in which these particles\r\nwill rest on cooling.  Probably that position will have some relation\r\nto the direction in which the heat escapes.  Now when all or a\r\nmajority of particles of the same nature have a general tendency to\r\none position, that must of course determine a cleavage plane.']  The\r\nboldness of the theory, indeed, has, in some cases, caused speculation\r\nto run riot, and we have books published on the action of polar forces\r\nand geologic magnetism, which rather astonish those who know something\r\nabout the subject.  According to this theory whole districts of North\r\nWales and Cumberland, mountains included, are neither more nor less\r\nthan the parts of a gigantic crystal.  These masses of slate were\r\noriginally fine mud, composed of the broken and abraded particles of\r\nolder rocks.  They contain silica, alumina, potash, soda, and mica\r\nmixed mechanically together.  In the course of ages the mixture became\r\nconsolidated, and the theory before us assumes that a process of\r\ncrystallisation afterwards rearranged the particles and developed in\r\nit a single plane of cleavage.  Though a bold, and I think\r\ninadmissible, stretch of analogies, this hypothesis has done good\r\nservice.  Right or wrong, a thoughtfully uttered theory has a dynamic\r\npower which operates against intellectual stagnation; and even by\r\nprovoking opposition is eventually of service to the cause of truth.\r\nIt would, however, have been remarkable if, among the ranks of\r\ngeologists themselves, men were not found to seek an explanation of\r\nslate-cleavage involving a less hardy assumption.\r\n\r\nThe first step in an enquiry of this kind is to seek facts.  This has\r\nbeen done, and the labours of Daniel Sharpe (the late President of the\r\nGeological Society, who, to the loss of science and the sorrow of all\r\nwho knew him, has so suddenly been taken away from us), Mr. Henry\r\nClifton Sorby, and others, have furnished us with a body of facts\r\nassociated with slaty cleavage, and having a most important bearing\r\nupon the question.\r\n\r\nFossil shells are found in these slate-rocks.  I have here several\r\nspecimens of such shells in the actual rock, and occupying various\r\npositions in regard to the cleavage planes.  They are squeezed,\r\ndistorted, and crushed; in all cases the distortion leads to the\r\ninference that the rock which contains these shells has been subjected\r\nto enormous pressure in a direction at right angles to the planes of\r\ncleavage.  The shells are all flattened and spread out in these\r\nplanes.  Compare this fossil trilobite of normal proportions with\r\nthese others which have suffered distortion.  Some have lain across,\r\nsome along, and some oblique to the cleavage of the slate in which\r\nthey are found; but in all cases the distortion is such, as required\r\nfor its production a compressing force acting, at right angles to the\r\nplanes of cleavage.  As the trilobites lay in the mud, the jaws of a\r\ngigantic vice appear to have closed upon them and squeezed them into\r\nthe shapes you see.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes find a thin layer of coarse gritty material, between two\r\nlayers of finer rock, through which and across the gritty layer pass\r\nthe planes of lamination.  The coarse layer is found bent by the\r\npressure into sinuosities like a contorted ribbon.  Mr. Sorby has\r\ndescribed a striking case of this kind.  This crumpling can be\r\nexperimentally imitated; the amount of compression might, moreover, be\r\nroughly estimated by supposing the contorted bed to be stretched out,\r\nits length measured and compared with the shorter distance into which\r\nit has been squeezed.  We find in this way that the yielding of the\r\nmass has been considerable.\r\n\r\nLet me now direct your attention to another proof of pressure; you see\r\nthe varying colours which indicate the bedding on this mass of slate.\r\nThe dark portion is gritty, being composed of comparatively coarse\r\nparticles, which, owing to their size, shape and gravity, sink first\r\nand constitute the bottom of each layer.  Gradually, from bottom to\r\ntop the coarseness diminishes, and near the upper surface we have a\r\nlayer of exceedingly fine grain.  It is the fine mud thus consolidated\r\nfrom which are derived the German razor-stones, so much prized for the\r\nsharpening of surgical instruments.\r\n\r\nWhen a bed is thin, the fine-grain slate is permitted to rest upon a\r\nslab of the coarse slate in contact with it; when the fine bed is\r\nthick, it is cut into slices which are cemented to pieces of ordinary\r\nslate, and thus rendered stronger.  The mud thus deposited is, as\r\nmight be expected, often rolled up into nodular masses, carried\r\nforward, and deposited among coarser material by the rivers from which\r\nthe slate-mud has subsided.  Here are such nodules enclosed in\r\nsandstone.  Everybody, moreover, who has ciphered upon a school-slate\r\nmust remember the whitish-green spots which sometimes dotted the\r\nsurface of the slate, and over which the pencil usually slid as if the\r\nspots were greasy.  Now these spots are composed of the finer mud, and\r\nthey could not, on account of their fineness, bite the pencil like the\r\nsurrounding gritty portions of the slate.  Here is a beautiful example\r\nof these spots: you observe them, on the cleavage surface, in broad\r\nround patches.  But turn the slate edgeways and the section of each\r\nnodule is seen to be a sharp oval with its longer axis parallel to the\r\ncleavage.  This instructive fact has been adduced by Mr. Sorby.  I\r\nhave made excursions to the quarries of Wales and Cumberland, and to\r\nmany of the slate yards of London, and found the fact general.  Thus\r\nwe elevate a common experience of our boyhood into evidence of the\r\nhighest significance as regards a most important geological problem.\r\nFrom the magnetic deportment of these slates, I was led to infer that\r\nthese spots contain a less amount of iron than the surrounding dark\r\nslate.  An analysis was made for me by Mr. Hambly in the laboratory of\r\nDr. Percy at the School of Mines with the following result:\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF SLATE.\r\n\r\nDark Slate, two analyses.\r\n\r\n1.  Percentage of iron     5.85\r\n\r\n2. Percentage of iron      6.13\r\n\r\n                    Mean   5.99\r\n\r\nWhitish Green Slate.\r\n\r\n1.  Percentage of iron     3.24\r\n\r\n2.  Percentage of iron     3.12\r\n\r\n                    Mean   3.18\r\n\r\nAccording to these analyses the quantity of iron in the dark slate\r\nimmediately adjacent to the greenish spot is nearly double the\r\nquantity contained in the spot itself.  This is about the proportion\r\nwhich the magnetic experiments suggested.\r\n\r\nLet me now remind you that the facts brought before you are\r\ntypical--each is the representative of a class.  We have seen shells\r\ncrushed; the trilobites squeezed, beds contorted, nodules of greenish\r\nmarl flattened; and all these sources of independent testimony point\r\nto one and the same conclusion, namely, that slate-rocks have been\r\nsubjected to enormous pressure in a direction at right angles to the\r\nPlanes of cleavage.\r\n\r\nIn reference to Mr. Sorby's contorted bed, I have said that by\r\nsupposing it to be stretched out and its length measured, it would\r\ngive us an idea of the amount of yielding of the mass above and below\r\nthe bed.  Such a measurement, however, would not give the exact amount\r\nof yielding.  I hold in my hand a specimen of slate with its bedding\r\nmarked upon it; the lower portions of each layer being composed of a\r\ncomparatively coarse gritty material something like what you may\r\nsuppose the contorted bed to be composed of.  Now in crossing these\r\ngritty portions, the cleavage turns, as if tending to cross the\r\nbedding at another angle.  When the pressure began to act, the\r\nintermediate bed, which is not entirely unyielding, suffered\r\nlongitudinal pressure; as it bent, the pressure became gradually more\r\ntransverse, and the direction of its cleavage is exactly such as you\r\nwould infer from an action of this kind--it is neither quite across\r\nthe bed, nor yet in the same direction as the cleavage of the slate\r\nabove and below it, but intermediate between both.  Supposing the\r\ncleavage to be at right angles to the pressure, this is the direction\r\nwhich it ought to take across these more unyielding strata.\r\n\r\nThus we have established the concurrence of the phenomena of cleavage\r\nand pressure--that they accompany each other; but the question still\r\nremains, Is the pressure sufficient to account for the cleavage?  A\r\nsingle geologist, as far as I am aware, answers boldly in the\r\naffirmative.  This geologist is Sorby, who has attacked the question\r\nin the true spirit of a physical investigator.  Call to mind the\r\ncleavage of the flags of Halifax and Over Darwen, which is caused by\r\nthe interposition of layers of mica between the gritty strata.  Mr.\r\nSorby finds plates of mica to be also a constituent of slate-rock.  He\r\nasks himself, what will be the effect of pressure upon a mass\r\ncontaining such plates confusedly mixed up in it?  It will be, he\r\nargues, and he argues rightly, to place the plates with their flat\r\nsurfaces more or less perpendicular to the direction in which the\r\npressure is exerted.  He takes scales of the oxide of iron, mixes them\r\nwith a fine powder, and on squeezing the mass finds that the tendency\r\nof the scales is to set themselves at right angles to the line of\r\npressure.  Along the planes of weakness produced by the scales the\r\nmass cleaves.\r\n\r\nBy tests of a different character from those applied by Mr. Sorby, it\r\nmight be shown how true his conclusion is--that the effect of pressure\r\non elongated particles, or plates, will be such as he describes it.\r\nBut while the scales must be regarded as a true cause, I should not\r\nascribe to them a large share in the production of the cleavage.  I\r\nbelieve that even if the plates of mica were wholly absent, the\r\ncleavage of slate-rocks would be much the same as it is at present.\r\n\r\nHere is a mass of pure white wax: it contains no mica particles, no\r\nscales of iron, or anything analogous to them.  Here is the selfsame\r\nsubstance submitted to pressure.  I would invite the attention of the\r\neminent geologists now before me to the structure of this wax.  No\r\nslate ever exhibited so clean a cleavage; it splits into laminae of\r\nsurpassing tenuity, and proves at a single stroke that pressure is\r\nsufficient to produce cleavage, and that this cleavage is independent\r\nof intermixed plates or scales.  I have purposely mixed this wax with\r\nelongated particles, and am unable to say at the present moment that\r\nthe cleavage is sensibly affected by their presence--if anything, I\r\nshould say they rather impair its fineness and clearness than promote\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe finer the slate is the more perfect will be the resemblance of its\r\ncleavage to that of the wax.  Compare the surface of the wax with the\r\nsurface of this slate from Borrodale in Cumberland.  You have\r\nprecisely the same features in both: you see flakes clinging to the\r\nsurfaces of each, which have been partially torn away in cleaving. Let\r\nany close observer compare these two effects, he will, I am persuaded,\r\nbe led to the conclusion that they are the product of a common cause.\r\n[Footnote: I have usually softened the wax by warming it, kneaded it\r\nwith the fingers, and pressed it between thick plates of glass\r\npreviously wetted.  At the ordinary summer temperature the pressed wax\r\nis soft, and tears rather than cleaves; on this account I cool my\r\ncompressed specimens in a mixture of pounded ice and salt, and when\r\nthus cooled they split cleanly.]\r\n\r\nBut you will ask me how, according to my view, does pressure produce\r\nthis remarkable result?  This may be stated in a very few words.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing in nature as a body of perfectly homogeneous\r\nstructure.  I break this clay which seems so uniform, and find that\r\nthe fracture presents to my eyes innumerable surfaces along which it\r\nhas given way, and it has yielded along those surfaces because in them\r\nthe cohesion of the mass is less than elsewhere.  I break this marble,\r\nand even this wax, and observe the same result; look at the mud at the\r\nbottom of a dried pond; look at some of the ungravelled walks in\r\nKensington Gardens on drying after rain,--they are cracked and split,\r\nand other circumstances being equal, they crack and split where the\r\ncohesion is a minimum.  Take then a mass of partially consolidated\r\nmud.  Such a mass is divided and subdivided by interior surfaces along\r\nwhich the cohesion is comparatively small.  Penetrate the mass in\r\nidea, and you will see it composed of numberless irregular polyhedra\r\nbounded by surfaces of weak cohesion.  Imagine such a mass subjected\r\nto pressure,--it yields and spreads out in the direction of least\r\nresistance; the little polyhedra become converted into laminae,\r\nseparated from each other by surfaces of weak cohesion, and the\r\ninfallible result will be a tendency to cleave at right angles to the\r\nline of pressure. [Footnote: It is scarcely necessary to say that if the\r\nmass were squeezed equally in all directions no laminated structure\r\ncould be produced; it must have room to yield in a lateral direction.\r\nMr. Warren De la Rue informs me that he once wished to obtain\r\nwhite-lead in a fine granular state, and to accomplish this he first\r\ncompressed it.  The mould was conical, and permitted the lead to\r\nspread out a little laterally.  The lamination was as perfect as that\r\nof slate, and it quite defeated him in his effort to obtain a granular\r\npowder.]\r\n\r\nFurther, a mass of dried mud is full of cavities and fissures.  If you\r\nbreak dried pipe-clay you see them in great numbers, and there are\r\nmultitudes of them so small that you cannot see them.  A flattening of\r\nthese cavities must take place in squeezed mud, and this must to some\r\nextent facilitate the cleavage of the mass in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the time at my disposal has not permitted me duly to develope\r\nthese thoughts, yet for the last twelve months the subject has\r\npresented itself to me almost daily under one aspect or another.  I\r\nhave never eaten a biscuit during this period without remarking the\r\ncleavage developed by the rolling-pin.  You have only to break a\r\nbiscuit across, and to look at the fracture, to see the laminated\r\nstructure.  We have here the means of pushing the analogy further.  I\r\ninvite you to compare the structure of this slate, which was subjected\r\nto a high temperature during the conflagration of Mr. Scott Russell's\r\npremises, with that of a biscuit.  Air or vapour within the slate has\r\ncaused it to swell, and the mechanical structure it reveals is\r\nprecisely that of a biscuit.  During these enquiries I have received\r\nmuch instruction in the manufacture of puff-paste.  Here is some such\r\npaste baked under my own superintendence.  The cleavage of our hills\r\nis accidental cleavage, but this is cleavage with intention.  The\r\nvolition of the pastrycook has entered into its formation.  It has\r\nbeen his aim to preserve a series of surfaces of structural weakness,\r\nalong which the dough divides into layers.  Puff-paste in preparation\r\nmust not be handled too much; it ought, moreover, to be rolled on a\r\ncold slab, to prevent the butter from melting, and diffusing itself,\r\nthus rendering the paste more homogeneous and less liable to split.\r\nPuff-paste is, then, simply an exaggerated case of slaty cleavage.\r\n\r\nThe principle here enunciated is so simple as to be almost trivial;\r\nnevertheless, it embraces not only the cases mentioned, but, if time\r\npermitted, it might be shown you that the principle has a much wider\r\nrange of application.  When iron is taken from the puddling furnace it\r\nis more or less spongy, an aggregate in fact of small nodules: it is\r\nat a welding heat, and at this temperature is submitted to the process\r\nof rolling.  Bright smooth bars are the result.  But notwithstanding\r\nthe high heat the nodules do not perfectly blend together.  The\r\nprocess of rolling draws them into fibres.  Here is a mass acted upon\r\nby dilute sulphuric acid, which exhibits in a striking manner this\r\nfibrous structure.  The experiment was made by my friend Dr. Percy,\r\nwithout any reference to the question of cleavage.\r\n\r\nBreak a piece of ordinary iron and you have a granular fracture; heat\r\nthe iron, you elongate these granules, and finally render the mass\r\nfibrous.  Here are pieces of rails along which the wheels of\r\nlocomotives have slid-den; the granules have yielded and become\r\nplates.  They exfoliate or come off in leaves; all these effects\r\nbelong, I believe, to the great class of phenomena of which slaty\r\ncleavage forms the most prominent example. [Footnote: For some further\r\nobservations on this subject by Mr. Sorby and myself, see\r\nPhilosophical Magazine for August, 1856.]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the termination of our task.  You have witnessed\r\nthe phenomena of crystallisation, and have had placed before you the\r\nfacts which are found associated with the cleavage of slate rocks.\r\nSuch facts, as expressed by Helmholtz, are so many telescopes to our\r\nspiritual vision, by which we can see backward through the night of\r\nantiquity, and discern the forces which have been in operation upon\r\nthe earth's surface\r\n\r\n        Ere the lion roared,\r\n        Or the eagle soared.\r\n\r\nFrom evidence of the most independent and trustworthy character, we\r\ncome to the conclusion that these slaty masses have been subjected to\r\nenormous pressure, and by the sure method of experiment we have\r\nshown--and this is the only really new point which has been brought\r\nbefore you--how the pressure is sufficient to produce the cleavage.\r\nExpanding our field of view, we find the self-same law, whose\r\nfootsteps we trace amid the crags of Wales and Cumberland, extending\r\ninto the domain of the pastrycook and ironfounder; nay, a wheel cannot\r\nroll over the half-dried mud of our streets without revealing to us\r\nmore or less of the features of this law.  Let me say, in conclusion,\r\nthat the spirit in which this problem has been attacked by geologists,\r\nindicates the dawning of a new day for their science.  The great\r\nintellects who have laboured at geology, and who have raised it to its\r\npresent pitch of grandeur, were compelled to deal with the subject in\r\nmass; they had no time to look after details.  But the desire for more\r\nexact knowledge is increasing; facts are flowing in which, while they\r\nleave untouched the intrinsic wonders of geology, are gradually\r\nsupplanting by solid truths the uncertain speculations which beset the\r\nsubject in its infancy.  Geologists now aim to imitate, as far as\r\npossible, the conditions of nature, and to produce her results; they\r\nare approaching more and more to the domain of physics, and I trust\r\nthe day will soon come when we shall interlace our friendly arms\r\nacross the common boundary of our sciences, and pursue our respective\r\ntasks in a spirit of mutual helpfulness, encouragement and goodwill.\r\n\r\n[I would now lay more stress on the lateral yielding, referred to in\r\nthe footnote concerning Mr. Warren De la Rue's attempt to produce\r\nfinely granular white-lead, accompanied as it is by tangential\r\nsliding, than I was prepared to do when this lecture was given.  This\r\nsliding is, I think, the principal cause of the planes of weakness,\r\nboth in pressed wax and slate rock.  J. T. 1871.]\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXIII.  ON PARAMAGNETIC AND DIAMAGNETIC FORCES\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Abstract of a discourse delivered in the Royal Institution,\r\nFebruary 1, 1856.]\r\n\r\nTHE notion of an attractive force, which draws bodies towards the\r\ncentre of the earth, was entertained by Anaxagoras and his pupils, by\r\nDemocritus, Pythagoras, and Epicurus; and the conjectures of these\r\nancients were renewed by Galileo, Huyghens, and others, who stated\r\nthat bodies attract each other as a magnet attracts iron.  Kepler\r\napplied the notion to bodies beyond the surface of the earth, and\r\naffirmed the extension of this force to the most distant stars.  Thus\r\nit would appear, that in the attraction of iron by a magnet originated\r\nthe conception of the force of gravitation.  Nevertheless, if we look\r\nclosely at the matter, it will be seen that the magnetic force\r\npossesses characters strikingly distinct from those of the force which\r\nholds the universe together.  The theory of gravitation is, that every\r\nparticle of matter attracts every other particle; in magnetism also we\r\nhave attraction, but we have always, at the same time, repulsion, the\r\nfinal effect being due to the difference of these two forces.  A body\r\nmay be intensely acted on by a magnet, and still no motion of\r\ntranslation will follow, if the repulsion be equal to the attraction.\r\nPrevious to magnetization, a dipping needle, when its centre of\r\ngravity is supported, stands accurately level; but, after\r\nmagnetization, one end of it, in our latitude, is pulled towards the\r\nnorth pole of the earth.  The needle, however, being suspended from\r\nthe arm of a fine balance, its weight is found unaltered by its\r\nmagnetization.  In like manner, when the needle is permitted to float\r\nupon a liquid, and thus to follow the attraction of the north magnetic\r\npole of the earth, there is no motion of the mass towards that pole.\r\nThe reason is known to be, that although the marked end of the needle\r\nis attracted by the north pole, the unmarked end is repelled by an\r\nequal force, the two equal and opposite forces neutralizing each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhen the pole of an ordinary magnet is brought to act upon the\r\nswimming needle, the latter is attracted,--the reason being that the\r\nattracted end of the needle being nearer to the pole of the magnet\r\nthan the repelled end, the force of attraction is the more powerful of\r\nthe two.  In the case of the earth, its pole is so distant that the\r\nlength of the needle is practically zero.  In like manner, when a\r\npiece of iron is presented to a magnet, the nearer parts are\r\nattracted, while the more distant parts are repelled; and because the\r\nattracted portions are nearer to the magnet than the repelled ones, we\r\nhave a balance in favour of attraction.  Here then is the special\r\ncharacteristic of the magnetic force, which distinguishes it from that\r\nof gravitation.  The latter is a simple unpolar force, while the\r\nformer is duplex or polar.  Were gravitation like magnetism, a stone\r\nwould no more fall to the ground than a piece of iron towards the\r\nnorth magnetic pole: and thus, however rich in consequences the\r\nsupposition of Kepler and others may have been, it is clear that a\r\nforce like that of magnetism would not be able to transact the\r\nbusiness of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe object of this discourse is to enquire whether the force of\r\ndiamagnetism, which manifests itself as a repulsion of certain bodies\r\nby the poles of a magnet, is to be ranged as a polar force, beside\r\nthat of magnetism; or as an unpolar force, beside that of gravitation.\r\nWhen a cylinder of soft iron is placed within a wire helix, and\r\nsurrounded by an electric current, the antithesis of its two ends, or,\r\nin other words, its polar excitation, is at once manifested by its\r\naction upon a magnetic needle; and it may be asked why a cylinder of\r\nbismuth may not be substituted for the cylinder of iron, and its state\r\nsimilarly examined.  The reason is, that the excitement of the bismuth\r\nis so feeble, that it would be quite masked by that of the helix in\r\nwhich it is enclosed; and the problem that now meets us is, so to\r\nexcite a diamagnetic body that the pure action of the body upon a\r\nmagnetic needle may be observed, unmixed with the action of the body\r\nused to excite the diamagnetic.\r\n\r\nHow this has been effected may be illustrated in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nWhen through an upright helix of covered copper wire, a voltaic\r\ncurrent is sent, the top of the helix attracts, while its bottom\r\nrepels, the same pole of a magnetic needle; its central point, on the\r\ncontrary, is neutral, and exhibits neither attraction nor repulsion.\r\nSuch a helix is caused to stand between the two poles N'S' of an\r\nastatic system. [Footnote: The reversal of the poles of the two\r\nmagnets, which were of the same strength, completely annulled the\r\naction of the earth as a magnet.]  The two magnets S N' and S'N are\r\nunited by a rigid cross piece at their centres, and are suspended from\r\nthe point a, so that both magnets swing in the same horizontal plane.\r\nIt is so arranged that the poles N' s' are opposite to the central or\r\nneutral point of the helix, so that when a current is sent through the\r\nlatter, the magnets, as before explained, are unaffected.  Here then\r\nwe have an excited helix which itself has no action upon the magnets,\r\nand we are thus enabled to examine the action of a body placed within\r\nthe helix and excited by it, undisturbed by the influence of the\r\nlatter.  The helix being 12 inches high, a cylinder of soft iron 6\r\ninches long, suspended from a string and passing over a pulley, can be\r\nraised or lowered within the helix.  When it is so far sunk that its\r\nlower end rests upon the table, the upper end finds itself between the\r\npoles N´S´ of the astatic system.  The iron cylinder is thus converted\r\ninto a strong magnet, attracting one of the poles, and repelling the\r\nother, and consequently deflecting the entire astatic system.  When\r\nthe cylinder is raised so that the upper end is at the level of the\r\ntop of the helix, its lower end comes between the poles N´S´; and a\r\ndeflection opposed in direction to the former one is the immediate\r\nconsequence.  To render these deflections more easily visible, a\r\nmirror m is attached to the system of magnets; a beam of light thrown\r\nupon the mirror being reflected and projected as a bright disk against\r\nthe wall.  The distance of this image from the mirror being\r\nconsiderable, and its angular motion double that of the latter, a very\r\nslight motion of the magnet is sufficient to produce a displacement of\r\nthe image through several yards.\r\n\r\nThis then is the principle of the beautiful apparatus [Footnote:\r\nDevised by Prof. W.  Weber, and constructed by M. Leyser, of Leipzig.]\r\nby which the investigation was conducted.  It is manifest that if a\r\nsecond helix be placed between the poles SN with a cylinder within\r\nit, the action upon the astatic magnet may be exalted.  This was the\r\narrangement made use of in the actual enquiry.  Thus to intensify the\r\nfeeble action, which it is here our object to seek, we have in the\r\nfirst place neutralized the action of the earth upon the magnets, by\r\nplacing them astatically.  Secondly, by making use of two cylinders,\r\nand permitting them to act simultaneously on the four poles of the\r\nmagnets, we have rendered the deflecting force four times what it\r\nwould be, if only a single pole were used.  Finally, the whole\r\napparatus was enclosed in a suitable case which protected the magnets\r\nfrom air-currents, and the deflections were read off through a glass\r\nplate in the case, by means of a telescope and scale placed at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the instrument.\r\n\r\nA pair of bismuth cylinders was first examined.  Sending a current\r\nthrough the helices, and observing that the magnets swung perfectly\r\nfree, it was first arranged that the bismuth cylinders within the\r\nhelices had their central or neutral points opposite to the poles of\r\nthe magnets.  All being at rest the number on the scale marked by the\r\ncross wire of the telescope was 572.  The cylinders were then moved,\r\none up the other down, so that two of their ends were brought to bear\r\nsimultaneously upon the magnetic poles: the magnet moved promptly, and\r\nafter some oscillations [Footnote: To lessen these a copper damper was\r\nmade use of.]  came to rest at the number 612; thus moving from a\r\nsmaller to a larger number.  The other two ends of the bars were next\r\nbrought to bear upon the magnet: a prompt deflection was the\r\nconsequence, and the final position of equilibrium was 526; the\r\nmovement being from a larger to a smaller number.  We thus observe a\r\nmanifest polar action of the bismuth cylinders upon the magnet; one\r\npair of ends deflecting it in one direction, and the other pair\r\ndeflecting it in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nSubstituting for the cylinders of bismuth thin cylinders of iron, of\r\nmagnetic slate, of sulphate of iron, carbonate of iron, protochloride\r\nof iron, red ferrocyanide of potassium, and other magnetic bodies, it\r\nwas found that when the position of the magnetic cylinders was the\r\nsame as that of the cylinders of bismuth, the deflection produced by\r\nthe former was always opposed in direction to that produced by the\r\nlatter; and hence the disposition of the force in the diamagnetic body\r\nmust have been precisely antithetical to its disposition in the\r\nmagnetic ones.\r\n\r\nBut it will be urged, and indeed has been urged against this\r\ninference, that the deflection produced by the bismuth cylinders may\r\nbe due to induced currents excited in the metal by its motion within\r\nthe helices.  In reply to this objection, it may be stated, in the\r\nfirst place, that the deflection is permanent, and cannot therefore be\r\ndue to induced currents, which are only of momentary duration.  It has\r\nalso been urged that such experiments ought to be made with other\r\nmetals, and with better conductors than bismuth; for if due to\r\ncurrents of induction, the better the conductor the more exalted will\r\nbe the effect.  This requirement was complied with.\r\n\r\nCylinders of antimony were substituted for those of bismuth.  This\r\nmetal is a better conductor of electricity, but less strongly\r\ndiamagnetic than bismuth.  If therefore the action referred to be due\r\nto induced currents we ought to have it greater in the case of\r\nantimony than with bismuth; but if it springs from a true diamagnetic\r\npolarity, the action of the bismuth ought to exceed that of the\r\nantimony.  Experiment proves this to be the case.  Hence the\r\ndeflection produced by these metals is due to their diamagnetic, and\r\nnot to their conductive capacity.  Copper cylinders were next\r\nexamined: here we have a metal which conducts electricity fifty times\r\nbetter than bismuth, but its diamagnetic power is nearly null; if the\r\neffects be due to induced currents we ought to have them here in an\r\nenormously exaggerated degree, but no sensible deflection was produced\r\nby the two cylinders of copper.\r\n\r\nIt has also been proposed by the opponents of diamagnetic polarity to\r\ncoat fragments of bismuth with some insulating substance, so as to\r\nrender the formation of induced currents impossible, and to test the\r\nquestion with cylinders of these fragments.  This requirement was also\r\nfulfilled.  It is only necessary to reduce the bismuth to powder and\r\nexpose it for a short time to the air to cause the particles to become\r\nso far oxidised as to render them perfectly insulating.  The\r\ninsulating power of the powder was exhibited experimentally;\r\nnevertheless, this powder, enclosed in glass tubes, exhibited an\r\naction scarcely less powerful than that of the massive bismuth\r\ncylinders.\r\n\r\nBut the most rigid proof, a proof admitted to be conclusive by those\r\nwho have denied the antithesis of magnetism and diamagnetism, remains\r\nto be stated.  Prisms of the same heavy glass as that with which the\r\ndiamagnetic force was discovered, were substituted for the metallic\r\ncylinders, and their action upon the magnet was proved to be precisely\r\nthe same in kind as that of the cylinders of bismuth.  The enquiry was\r\nalso extended to other insulators: to phosphorus, sulphur, nitre,\r\ncalcareous spar, statuary marble, with the same invariable result:\r\neach of these substances was proved to be polar, the disposition of\r\nthe force being the same as that of bismuth and the reverse of that of\r\niron.  When a bar of iron is set erect, its lower end is known to be a\r\nnorth pole, and its upper end a south pole, in virtue of the earth's\r\ninduction.  A marble statue, on the contrary, has its feet a south\r\npole, and its head a north pole, and there is no doubt that the same\r\nremark applies to its living archetype; each man walking over the\r\nearth's surface is a true diamagnet, with its poles the reverse of\r\nthose of a mass of magnetic matter of the same shape and position.\r\n\r\nAn experiment of practical value, as affording a ready estimate of the\r\ndifferent conductive powers of two metals for electricity, was\r\nexhibited in the lecture, for the purpose of proving experimentally\r\nsome of the statements made in reference to this subject.  A cube of\r\nbismuth was suspended by a twisted string between the two poles of an\r\nelectro-magnet.  The cube was attached by a short copper wire to a\r\nlittle square pyramid, the base of which was horizontal, and its sides\r\nformed of four small triangular pieces of looking-glass.  A beam of\r\nlight was suffered to fall upon this reflector, and as the reflector\r\nfollowed the motion of the cube the images cast from its sides\r\nfollowed each other in succession, each describing a circle about\r\nthirty feet in diameter.  As the velocity of rotation augmented, these\r\nimages blended into a continuous ring of light.  At a particular\r\ninstant the electro-magnet was excited, currents were evolved in the\r\nrotating cube, and the strength of these currents, which increases\r\nwith the conductivity of the cube for electricity, was practically\r\nestimated by the time required to bring the cube and its associated\r\nmirrors to a state of rest. With bismuth this time amounted to a score\r\nof seconds or more: a cube of copper, on the contrary, was struck\r\nalmost instantly motionless when the circuit was established.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXIV. PHYSICAL BASIS OF SOLAR CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a discourse delivered at the Royal Institution of\r\nGreat Britain, June 7, 1861.]\r\n\r\nOMITTING all preface, attention was first drawn to an experimental\r\narrangement intended to prove that gaseous bodies radiate heat in\r\ndifferent degrees.  Near a double screen of polished tin was placed an\r\nordinary ring gas-burner, and on this was placed a hot copper ball,\r\nfrom which a column of heated air ascended.  Behind the screen, but so\r\nsituated that no ray from the ball could reach the instrument, was an\r\nexcellent Thermo-electric pile, connected by wires with a very\r\ndelicate galvanometer.  The pile was known to be an instrument whereby\r\nheat is applied to the generation of electric currents; the strength\r\nof the current being an accurate measure of the quantity of the heat.\r\nAs long as both faces of the pile are at the same temperature, no\r\ncurrent is produced; but the slightest difference in the temperature\r\nof the two faces at once declares itself by the production of a\r\ncurrent, which, when carried through the galvanometer, indicates by\r\nthe deflection of the needle both its strength and its direction.\r\n\r\nThe two faces of the pile were in the first instance brought to the\r\nsame temperature; the equilibrium being shown by the needle of the\r\ngalvanometer standing at zero.  The rays emitted by the current of hot\r\nair already referred to were permitted to fall upon one of the faces\r\nof the pile; and an extremely slight movement of the needle showed\r\nthat the radiation from the hot air, though sensible, was extremely\r\nfeeble.  Connected with the ring-burner was a holder containing oxygen\r\ngas; and by turning a cock, a stream of this gas was permitted to\r\nissue from the burner, strike the copper ball, and ascend in a heated\r\ncolumn in front of the pile.  The result was, that oxygen showed\r\nitself, as a radiator of heat, to be quite as feeble as atmospheric\r\nair.\r\n\r\nA second holder containing olefiant gas was then connected with the\r\nring-burner.  Oxygen and air had already flowed over the ball and\r\ncooled it in some degree.  Hence the olefiant gas laboured under a\r\ndisadvantage.  But on permitting the gas to rise from the ball, it\r\ncasts an amount of heat against the adjacent face of the pile\r\nsufficient to impel the needle of the galvanometer almost to 90°. This\r\nexperiment proved the vast difference between two equally invisible\r\ngases with regard to their power of emitting radiant heat.\r\n\r\nThe converse experiment was now performed.  The thermo-electric pile\r\nwas removed and placed between two cubes filled with water kept in a\r\nstate of constant ebullition; and it was so arranged that the\r\nquantities of heat falling from the cubes on the opposite faces of the\r\npile were exactly equal, thus neutralising each other.  The needle of\r\nthe galvanometer being at zero, a sheet of oxygen gas was caused to\r\nissue from a slit between one of the cubes and the adjacent face of\r\nthe pile.  If this sheet of gas possessed any sensible power of\r\nintercepting the thermal rays from the cube, one face of the pile\r\nbeing deprived of the heat thus intercepted, a difference of\r\ntemperature between its two faces would instantly set in, and the\r\nresult would be declared by the galvanometer.  The quantity absorbed\r\nby the oxygen under those circumstances was too feeble to affect the\r\ngalvanometer; the gas, in fact, proved perfectly transparent to the\r\nrays of heat.  It had but a feeble power of radiation: it had an\r\nequally feeble power of absorption.\r\n\r\nThe pile remaining in its position, a sheet of olefiant gas was caused\r\nto issue from the same slit as that through which the oxygen had\r\npassed.  No one present could see the gas; it was quite invisible, the\r\nlight went through it as freely as through oxygen or air; but its\r\neffect upon the thermal rays emanating from the cube was what might be\r\nexpected from a sheet of metal.  A quantity so large was cut off, that\r\nthe needle of the galvanometer, promptly quitting the zero line, moved\r\nwith energy to its stops.  Thus the olefiant gas, so light and clear\r\nand pervious to luminous rays, was proved to be a most potent\r\ndestroyer of the rays emanating from an obscure source.  The\r\nreciprocity of action established in the case of oxygen comes out\r\nhere; the good radiator is found by this experiment to be the good\r\nabsorber.\r\n\r\nThis result, now exhibited before a public audience for the first\r\ntime, was typical of what had been obtained with gases generally.\r\nGoing through the entire list of gases and vapours in this way, we\r\nfind radiation and absorption to be as rigidly associated as positive\r\nand negative in electricity, or as north and south polarity in\r\nmagnetism.  So that if we make the number which expresses the\r\nabsorptive power the numerator of a fraction, and that which expresses\r\nits radiative power the denominator, the result would be, that on\r\naccount of the numerator and denominator varying in the same,\r\nproportion, the value of that fraction would always remain the same,\r\nwhatever might be the gas or vapour experimented with.\r\n\r\nBut why should this reciprocity exist?  What is the meaning of\r\nabsorption?  what is the meaning of radiation?  When you cast a stone\r\ninto still water, rings of waves surround the place where it falls;\r\nmotion is radiated on all sides from the centre of disturbance.  When\r\na hammer strikes a bell, the latter vibrates; and sound, which is\r\nnothing more than an undulatory motion of the air, is radiated in all\r\ndirections.  Modern philosophy reduces light and heat to the same\r\nmechanical category.  A luminous body is one with its atoms in a state\r\nof vibration; a hot body is one with its atoms also vibrating, but at\r\na rate which is incompetent to excite the sense of vision; and, as a\r\nsounding body has the air around it, through which it propagates its\r\nvibrations, so also the luminous or heated body has a medium, called\r\naether, which accepts its motions and carries them forward with\r\ninconceivable velocity.  Radiation, then, as regards both light and\r\nheat, is the transference of motion from the vibrating body to the\r\naether in which it swings: and, as in the case of sound, the motion\r\nimparted to the air is soon transferred to surrounding objects,\r\nagainst which the aerial undulations strike, the sound being, in\r\ntechnical language, absorbed; so also with regard to light and heat,\r\nabsorption consists in the transference of motion from the agitated\r\naether to the molecules of the absorbing body.\r\n\r\nThe simple atoms are found to be bad radiators; the compound atoms\r\ngood ones: and the higher the degree of complexity in the atomic\r\ngrouping, the more potent, as a general rule, is the radiation and\r\nabsorption.  Let us get definite ideas here, however gross, and purify\r\nthem afterwards by the process of abstraction.  Imagine our simple\r\natoms swinging like single spheres in the aether; they cannot create\r\nthe swell which a group of them united to form a system can produce.\r\nAn oar runs freely edgeways through the water, and imparts far less of\r\nits motion to the water than when its broad flat side is brought to\r\nbear upon it.  In our present language the oar, broad side vertical,\r\nis a good radiator; broad side horizontal, it is a bad radiator.\r\nConversely the waves of water, impinging upon the flat face of the\r\noar-blade, will impart a greater amount of motion to it than when\r\nimpinging upon the edge.  In the position in which the oar radiates\r\nwell, it also absorbs well.  Simple atoms glide through the aether\r\nwithout much resistance; compound ones encounter resistance, and hence\r\nyield up more speedily their motion to the aether.  Mix oxygen and\r\nnitrogen mechanically, they absorb and radiate a certain amount of\r\nheat.  Cause these gases to combine chemically and form nitrous oxide,\r\nboth the absorption and radiation are thereby augmented hundreds of\r\ntimes!\r\n\r\nIn this way we look with the telescope of the intellect into atomic\r\nsystems, and obtain a conception of processes which the eye of sense\r\ncan never reach.  But gases and vapours possess a power of choice as\r\nto the rays which they absorb.  They single out certain groups of rays\r\nfor destruction, and allow other groups to pass unharmed.  This is\r\nbest illustrated by a famous experiment of Sir David Brewster's,\r\nmodified to suit present requirements.  Into a glass cylinder, with\r\nits ends stopped by discs of plate-glass, a small quantity of nitrous\r\nacid gas is introduced; the presence of the gas being indicated by its\r\nrich brown colour.  The beam from an electric lamp being sent through\r\ntwo prisms of bisulphide of carbon, a spectrum seven feet long and\r\neighteen inches wide is cast upon the screen.  Introducing the\r\ncylinder containing the nitrous acid into the path of the beam as it\r\nissues from the lamp, the splendid and continuous spectrum becomes\r\ninstantly furrowed by numerous dark bands, the rays answering to which\r\nare intercepted by the nitric gas, while the light which falls upon\r\nthe intervening spaces is permitted to pass with comparative impunity.\r\n\r\nHere also the principle of reciprocity, as regards radiation and\r\nabsorption, holds good; and could we, without otherwise altering its\r\nphysical character, render that nitrous gas luminous, we should find\r\nthat the very rays which it absorbs are precisely those which it would\r\nemit.  When atmospheric air and other gases are brought to a state of\r\nintense incandescence by the passage of an electric spark, the spectra\r\nwhich we obtain from them consist of a series of bright bands.  But\r\nsuch spectra are produced with the greatest brilliancy when, instead\r\nof ordinary gases, we make use of metals heated so highly as to\r\nvolatilise them.  This is easily done by the voltaic current.  A\r\ncapsule of carbon filled with mercury, which formed the positive\r\nelectrode of the electric lamp, has a carbon point brought down upon\r\nit.  On separating the one from the other, a brilliant arc containing\r\nthe mercury in a volatilised condition passes between them.  The\r\nspectrum of this arc is not continuous like that of the solid carbon\r\npoints, but consists of a series of vivid bands, each corresponding in\r\ncolour to that particular portion of the spectrum to which its rays\r\nbelong.  Copper gives its system of bands; zinc gives its system; and\r\nbrass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc, gives a spectrum made up\r\nof the bands belonging to both metals.\r\n\r\nNot only, however, when metals are united like zinc and copper to form\r\nan alloy, is it possible to obtain the bands which belong to them.  No\r\nmatter how we may disguise the metal--allowing it to unite with oxygen\r\nto form an oxide, and this again with an acid to form a salt; if the\r\nheat applied be sufficiently intense, the bands belonging to the metal\r\nreveal themselves with perfect definition.  Into holes drilled in a\r\ncylinder of retort carbon, pure culinary salt is introduced.  When the\r\ncarbon is made the positive electrode of the lamp, the resultant\r\nspectrum shows the brilliant yellow lines of the metal sodium.\r\nSimilar experiments made with the chlorides of strontium, calcium,\r\nlithium, [Footnote: The vividness of the colours of the lithium\r\nspectrum is extraordinary; the spectrum, moreover, contained a blue\r\nband of indescribable splendour.  It was thought by many, during the\r\ndiscourse, that I had mistaken strontium for lithium, as this blue\r\nband had never before been seen.  I have obtained it many times since;\r\nand my friend Dr. Miller, having kindly analysed the substance made\r\nuse of, pronounces it pure chloride of lithium.--J. T.]  and other\r\nmetals, give the bands due to the respective metals. When different\r\nsalts are mixed together, and rammed into holes in the carbon; a\r\nspectrum is obtained which contains the bands of them all.\r\n\r\nThe position of these bright bands never varies, and each metal has\r\nits own system.  Hence the competent observer can infer from the bands\r\nof the spectrum the metals which produce it.  It is a language\r\naddressed to the eye instead of the ear; and the certainty would not\r\nbe augmented if each metal possessed the power of audibly calling out,\r\n'I am here!' Nor is this language affected by distance.  If we find\r\nthat the sun or the stars give us the bands of our terrestrial metals,\r\nit is a declaration on the part of these orbs that such metals enter\r\ninto their composition.  Does the sun give us any such intimation?\r\nDoes the solar spectrum exhibit bright lines which we might compare\r\nwith those produced by our terrestrial metals, and prove either their\r\nidentity or difference?  No.  The solar spectrum, when closely\r\nexamined, gives us a multitude of fine dark lines instead of bright\r\nones.  They were first noticed by Dr. Wollaston, but were multiplied\r\nand investigated with profound skill by Fraunhofer, and named after\r\nhim Fraunhofer's lines.  They had been long a standing puzzle to\r\nphilosophers.  The bright lines yielded by metallic vapours had been\r\nalso known to us for years; but the connection between both classes of\r\nphenomena was wholly unknown, until Kirchhoff, with admirable\r\nacuteness, revealed the secret, and placed it at the same time in our\r\npower to chemically analyse the sun.\r\n\r\nWe have now some difficult work before us.  Hitherto we have been\r\ndelighted by objects which addressed themselves as much to our\r\naesthetic taste as to our scientific faculty; we have ridden\r\npleasantly to the base of the final cone of Etna, and must now\r\ndismount and march through ashes and lava, if we would enjoy the\r\nprospect from the summit.  Our problem is to connect the dark lines of\r\nFraunhofer with the bright ones of the metals.  The white beam of the\r\nlamp is refracted in passing through our two prisms, but its different\r\ncomponents are refracted in different degrees, and thus its colours\r\nare drawn apart.\r\n\r\nNow the colour depends solely upon the rate of oscillation of the\r\natoms of the luminous body; red light being produced by one rate, blue\r\nlight by a much quicker rate, and the colours between red and blue by\r\nthe intermediate rates.  The solid incandescent coal-points give us a\r\ncontinuous spectrum; or in other words they emit rays of all possible\r\nperiods between the two extremes of the spectrum.  Colour, as many of\r\nyou know, is to light what _pitch_ is to sound.  When a violin-player\r\npresses his finger on a string he makes it shorter and tighter, and\r\nthus, causing it to vibrate more speedily, heightens the pitch.\r\nImagine such a player to move his fingers slowly along the string,\r\nshortening it gradually as he draws his bow, the note would rise in\r\npitch by a regular gradation; there would be no gap intervening\r\nbetween note and note.  Here we have the analogue to the continuous\r\nspectrum, whose colours insensibly blend together without gap or\r\ninterruption, from the red of the lowest pitch to the violet of the\r\nhighest. But suppose the player, instead of gradually shortening his\r\nstring, to press his finger on a certain point, and to sound the\r\ncorresponding note; then to pass on to another point more or less\r\ndistant, and sound its note; then to another, and so on, thus sounding\r\nparticular notes separated from each other by gaps which correspond to\r\nthe intervals of the string passed over; we should then have the exact\r\nanalogue of a spectrum composed of separate bright bands with\r\nintervals of darkness between them.  But this, though a perfectly true\r\nand intelligible analogy, is not sufficient for our purpose; we must\r\nlook with the mind's eye at the oscillating atoms of the volatilised\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nFigure these atoms as connected together by springs of a certain\r\ntension, which, if the atoms are squeezed together, push them again\r\nasunder, and if the atoms are drawn apart, pull them again together,\r\ncausing them, before coming to rest, to quiver for a certain time at a\r\ncertain definite rate determined by the strength of the spring.  Now\r\nthe volatilised metal which gives us one bright band is to be figured\r\nas having its atoms united by springs all of the same tension, its\r\nvibrations are all of one kind.  The metal which gives us two bands\r\nmay be figured as having some of its atoms united by springs of one\r\ntension, and others by springs of a different tension.  Its vibrations\r\nare of two distinct kinds; so also when we have three or more bands we\r\nare to figure as many distinct sets of springs, each capable of\r\nvibrating in its own particular time and at a different rate from the\r\nothers.  If we seize this idea definitely, we shall have no difficulty\r\nin dropping the metaphor of springs, and substituting for it mentally\r\nthe forces by which the atoms act upon each other.  Having thus far\r\ncleared our way, let us make another effort to advance.\r\n\r\nA heavy ivory ball is here suspended from a string.  I blow against\r\nthis ball; a single puff of my breath moves it a little way from its\r\nposition of rest; it swings back towards me, and when it reaches the\r\nlimit of its swing I puff again.  It now swings further; and thus by\r\ntiming the puffs I can so accumulate their action as to produce\r\noscillations of large amplitude.  The ivory ball here has absorbed the\r\nmotion which my breath communicated to the air.  I now bring the ball\r\nto rest. Suppose, instead of the breath, a wave of air to strike\r\nagainst it, and that this wave is followed by a series of others which\r\nsucceed each other exactly in the same intervals as my puffs; it is\r\nobvious that these waves would communicate their motion to the ball\r\nand cause it to swing as the puffs did.  And it is equally manifest\r\nthat this would not be the case if the impulses of the waves were not\r\nproperly timed; for then the motion imparted to the pendulum by one\r\nwave would be neutralised by another, and there could not be the\r\naccumulation of effect obtained when the periods of the waves\r\ncorrespond with the periods of the pendulum.  So much for the\r\nparticular impulses absorbed by the pendulum.  But if such a pendulum\r\nset oscillating in air could produce waves in the air, it is evident\r\nthat the waves it would produce would be of the same period as those\r\nwhose motions it would take up or absorb most completely, if they\r\nstruck against it.  Perhaps the most curious effect of these timed\r\nimpulses ever described was that observed by a watchmaker, named\r\nEllicott, in the year 1741. He left two clocks leaning against the\r\nsame rail; one of them, which we may call A, was set going; the other,\r\nB, not.  Some time afterwards he found, to his surprise, that B was\r\nticking also.  The pendulums being of the same length, the shocks\r\nimparted by the ticking of A to the rail against which both clocks\r\nrested were propagated to B, and were so timed as to set B going.\r\nOther curious effects were at the same time observed.  When, the\r\npendulums differed from each other a certain amount, set B going, but\r\nthe reaction of B stopped A.  Then B set A going, and the re-action of\r\nA stopped B.  When the periods of oscillation were close to each\r\nother, but still not quite alike, the clocks mutually controlled each\r\nother, and by a kind of compromise they ticked in perfect unison.\r\n\r\nBut what has all this to do with our present subject?  The varied\r\nactions of the universe are all modes of motion; and the vibration of\r\na ray claims strict brotherhood with the vibrations of our pendulum.\r\nSuppose aethereal waves striking upon atoms which oscillate in the\r\nsame periods as the waves, the motion of the waves will be absorbed by\r\nthe atoms; suppose we send our beam of white light through a sodium\r\nflame, the atoms of that flame will be chiefly affected by those\r\nundulations which are synchronous with their own periods of vibration.\r\nThere will be on the part of those particular rays a transference of\r\nmotion from the agitated aether to the atoms of the volatilised metal,\r\nwhich, as already defined, is absorption.\r\n\r\nThe experiment justifying this conclusion is now for the first time to\r\nbe made before a public audience.  I pass a beam through our two\r\nprisms, and the spectrum spreads its colours upon the screen.  Between\r\nthe lamp and the prism I interpose a snapdragon light.  Alcohol and\r\nwater are here mixed with common salt, and the metal dish that holds\r\nthem is heated by a spirit-lamp.  The vapour from the mixture ignites\r\nand we have a monochromatic flame.  Through this flame the beam from\r\nthe lamp is now passing; and observe the result upon the spectrum. You\r\nsee a shady band cut out of the yellow,--not very dark, but\r\nsufficiently so to be seen by everybody present.\r\n\r\nBut let me exalt this effect.  Placing in front of the electric lamp\r\nthe intense flame of a large Bunsen's burner, a platinum capsule\r\ncontaining a bit of sodium less than a pea in magnitude is plunged\r\ninto the flame.  The sodium soon volatilises and burns with brilliant\r\nincandescence.  The beam crosses the flame, and at the same time the\r\nyellow band of the spectrum is clearly and sharply cut out, a band of\r\nintense darkness occupying its place.  On withdrawing the sodium, the\r\nbrilliant yellow of the spectrum takes its proper place, while the\r\nreintroduction of the flame causes the band to reappear.\r\n\r\nLet me be more precise: The yellow colour of the spectrum extends\r\nover a sensible space, blending on one side with the orange and on the\r\nother with the green.  The term 'yellow band' is therefore somewhat\r\nindefinite.  This vagueness may be entirely removed.  By dipping the\r\ncarbon-point used for the positive electrode into a solution of common\r\nsalt, and replacing it in the lamp, the bright yellow band produced by\r\nthe sodium vapour stands out from the spectrum.  When the sodium flame\r\nis caused to act upon the beam it is that particular yellow band that\r\nis obliterated, an intensely black streak occupying its place.\r\n\r\nAn additional step of reasoning leads to the conclusion that if,\r\ninstead of the flame of sodium alone, we were to introduce into the\r\npath of the beam a flame in which lithium, strontium, magnesium,\r\ncalcium, &c, are in a state of volatilisation, each metallic vapour\r\nwould cut out a system of bands, corresponding exactly in position\r\nwith the bright bands of the same metallic vapour.  The light of our\r\nelectric lamp shining through such a composite flame would give us a\r\nspectrum cut up by dark lines, exactly as the solar spectrum is cut up\r\nby the lines of Fraunhofer.\r\n\r\nThus by the combination of the strictest reasoning with the most\r\nconclusive experiment, we reach the solution of one of the grandest of\r\nscientific problems--the constitution of the sun.  The sun consists of\r\na nucleus surrounded by a flaming atmosphere.  The light of the\r\nnucleus would give us a continuous spectrum, like that of our common\r\ncarbon-points; but having to pass through the photosphere, as our beam\r\nhad to pass through the flame, those rays of the nucleus which the\r\nphotosphere can itself emit are absorbed, and shaded spaces,\r\ncorresponding to the particular rays absorbed, occur in the spectrum.\r\nAbolish the solar nucleus, and we should have a spectrum showing a\r\nbright line in the place of every dark line of Fraunhofer.  These\r\nlines are therefore not absolutely dark, but dark by an amount\r\ncorresponding to the difference between the light of the nucleus\r\nintercepted by the photosphere, and the light which issues from the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom we owe this noble generalisation is Kirchhoff,\r\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Heidelberg;\r\n[Footnote: Now Professor in the University of Berlin.] but, like\r\nevery other great discovery, it is compounded of various elements. Mr.\r\nTalbot observed the bright lines in the spectra of coloured flames.\r\nSixteen years ago Dr. Miller gave drawings and descriptions of the\r\nspectra of various coloured flames.  Wheatstone, with his accustomed\r\ningenuity, analysed the light of the electric spark, and showed that\r\nthe metals between which the spark passed determined the bright bands\r\nin the spectrum of the spark.  Masson published a prize essay on these\r\nbands; Van der Willigen, and more recently Plucker, have given us\r\nbeautiful drawings of the spectra, obtained from the discharge of\r\nRuhmkorff's coil.  But none of these distinguished men betrayed the\r\nleast knowledge of the connection between the bright bands of the\r\nmetals and the dark lines of the solar spectrum.  The man who came\r\nnearest to the philosophy of the subject was Angstrom.  In a paper\r\ntranslated from Poggendorff's 'Annalen' by myself, and published in\r\nthe 'Philosophical Magazine' for 1855, he indicates that the rays\r\nwhich a body absorbs are precisely those which it can emit when\r\nrendered luminous.  In another place, he speaks of one of his spectra\r\ngiving the general impression of a reversal of the solar spectrum.\r\nFoucault, Stokes, and Thomson, have all been very close to the\r\ndiscovery; and, for my own part, the examination of the radiation and\r\nabsorption of heat by gases and vapours, some of the results of which\r\nI placed before you at the commencement of this discourse, would have\r\nled me in 1859 to the law on which all Kirchhoff's speculations are\r\nfounded, had not an accident withdrawn me from the investigation.  But\r\nKirchhoff's claims are unaffected by these circumstances.  True, much\r\nthat I have referred to formed the necessary basis of his discovery;\r\nso did the laws of Kepler furnish to Newton the basis of the theory of\r\ngravitation.  But what Kirchhoff has done carries us far beyond all\r\nthat had before been accomplished.  He has introduced the order of law\r\namid a vast assemblage of empirical observations, and has ennobled our\r\nprevious knowledge by showing its relationship to some of the most\r\nsublime of natural phenomena.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXV.  ELEMENTARY MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nA LECTURE TO SCHOOLMASTERS.\r\n\r\nWE have no reason to believe that the sheep or the dog, or indeed any\r\nof the lower animals, feel an interest in the laws by which natural\r\nphenomena are regulated.  A herd may be terrified by a thunderstorm;\r\nbirds may go to roost, and cattle return to their stalls, during a\r\nsolar eclipse; but neither birds nor cattle, as far as we know, ever\r\nthink of enquiring into the causes of these things.  It is otherwise\r\nwith Man.  The presence of natural objects, the occurrence of natural\r\nevents, the varied appearances of the universe in which he dwells\r\npenetrate beyond his organs of sense, and appeal to an inner power of\r\nwhich the senses are the mere instruments and excitants.  No fact is\r\nto him either original or final.  He cannot limit himself to the\r\ncontemplation of it alone, but endeavours to ascertain its position in\r\na series to which uniform experience assures him it must belong.  He\r\nregards all that he witnesses in the present as the efflux and\r\nsequence of something that has gone before, and as the source of a\r\nsystem of events which is to follow.  The notion of spontaneity, by\r\nwhich in his ruder state he accounted for natural events, is\r\nabandoned; the idea that nature is an aggregate of independent parts\r\nalso disappears, as the connection and mutual dependence of physical\r\npowers become more and more manifest: until he is finally led to\r\nregard Nature as an organic whole--as a body each of whose members\r\nsympathises with the rest, changing, it is true, from age to age, but\r\nchanging without break of continuity in the relation of cause and\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe system of things which we call Nature is, however, too vast and\r\nvarious to be studied first-hand by any single mind.  As knowledge\r\nextends there is always a tendency to subdivide the field of\r\ninvestigation.  Its various parts are taken up by different minds, and\r\nthus receive a greater amount of attention than could possibly be\r\nbestowed on them if each investigator aimed at the mastery of the\r\nwhole.  The centrifugal form in which knowledge, as a whole, advances,\r\nspreading ever wider on all sides, is due in reality to the exertions\r\nof individuals, each of whom directs his efforts, more or less, along\r\na single line.  Accepting, in many respects, his culture from his\r\nfellow-men--taking it from spoken words or from written books--in some\r\none direction, the student of Nature ought actually to touch his work.\r\nHe may otherwise be a distributor of knowledge, but not a creator, and\r\nhe fails to attain that vitality of thought, and correctness of\r\njudgment, which direct and habitual contact with natural truth can\r\nalone impart.\r\n\r\nOne large department of the system of Nature which forms the chief\r\nsubject of my own studies, and to which it is my duty to call your\r\nattention this evening, is that of physics, or natural philosophy.\r\nThis term is large enough to cover the study of Nature generally, but\r\nit is usually restricted to a department which, perhaps, lies closer\r\nto our perceptions than any other.  It deals with the phenomena and\r\nlaws of light and heat--with the phenomena and laws of magnetism and\r\nelectricity--with those of sound--with the pressures and motions of\r\nliquids and gases, whether at rest or in a state of translation or of\r\nundulation.  The science of mechanics is a portion of natural\r\nphilosophy, though at present so large as to need the exclusive\r\nattention of him who would cultivate it profoundly.  Astronomy is the\r\napplication of physics to the motions of the heavenly bodies, the\r\nvastness of the field causing it, however, to bed regarded as a\r\ndepartment in itself.  In chemistry physical agents play important\r\nparts.  By heat and light we cause atoms and molecules to unite or to\r\nfall asunder.  Electricity exerts a similar power.  Through their\r\nability to separate nutritive compounds into their constituents, the\r\nsolar beams build up the whole vegetable world, and by it the animal\r\nworld.  The touch of the self-same beams causes hydrogen and chlorine\r\nto; unite with sudden explosion, and to form by their combination a\r\npowerful acid.  Thus physics and chemistry intermingle.  Physical\r\nagents are, however, employed by the chemist as a means to an end;\r\nwhile in physics proper the laws and phenomena of the agents\r\nthemselves, both qualitative and quantitative, are the primary objects\r\nof attention.\r\n\r\nMy duty here to-night is to spend an hour in telling how this subject\r\nis to be studied, and how a knowledge of it is to be imparted to\r\nothers.  From the domain of physics, which would be unmanageable as a\r\nwhole, I select as a sample the subject of magnetism.  I might readily\r\nentertain you on the present occasion with an account of what natural\r\nphilosophy has accomplished.  I might point to those applications of\r\nscience of which we hear so much in the newspapers, and which are so\r\noften mistaken for science itself.  I might, of course, ring changes\r\non the steam-engine and the telegraph, the electrotype and the\r\nphotograph, the medical applications of physics, and the various other\r\ninlets by which scientific thought filters into practical life.  That\r\nwould be easy compared with the task of informing you how you are to\r\nmake the study of physics the instrument of your pupil's culture; how\r\nyou are to possess its facts and make them living seeds which shall\r\ntake root and grow in the mind, and not lie like dead lumber in the\r\nstorehouse of memory.  This is a task much heavier than the mere\r\nrecounting of scientific achievements; and it is one which, feeling my\r\nown want of time to execute it aright, I might well hesitate to\r\naccept.\r\n\r\nBut let me sink excuses, and attack the work before me.  First and\r\nforemost, then, I would advise you to get a knowledge of facts from\r\nactual observation.  Facts looked at directly are vital; when they\r\npass into words half the sap is taken out of them.  You wish, for\r\nexample, to get a knowledge of magnetism; well, provide yourself with\r\na good book on the subject, if you can, but do not be content with\r\nwhat the book tells you; do not be satisfied with its descriptive\r\nwoodcuts; see the operations of the force yourself.  Half of our book\r\nwriters describe experiments which they never made, and their\r\ndescriptions often lack both force and truth; but, no matter how\r\nclever or conscientious they may be, their written words cannot supply\r\nthe place of actual observation.  Every fact has numerous radiations,\r\nwhich are shorn off by the man who describes it.\r\n\r\nGo, then, to a philosophical instrument maker, and give a shilling or\r\nhalf a crown for a straight bar-magnet, or, if you can afford it,\r\npurchase a pair of them; or get a smith to cut a length of ten inches\r\nfrom a bar of steel an inch wide and half an inch thick; file its ends\r\nsmoothly, harden it, and get somebody like myself to magnetise it.\r\nProcure some darning needles, and also a little unspun silk, which\r\nwill give you a suspending fibre void of torsion.  Make little loop\r\nof paper, or of wire, and attach your fibre to it.  Do it neatly.  In\r\nthe loop place a darning-needle, and bring the two ends or poles, as\r\nthey are called, of your bar-magnet successively up to the ends of the\r\nneedle.  Both the poles, you find, attract both ends of the needle.\r\nReplace the needle by a bit of annealed iron wire; the same effects\r\nensue.  Suspend successively little rods of lead, copper, silver,\r\nbrass, wood, glass, ivory, or whalebone; the magnet produces no\r\nsensible effect upon any of the substances.  You thence infer a\r\nspecial property in the case of steel and iron.  Multiply your\r\nexperiments, However, and you will find that some other substances,\r\nbesides iron and steel, are acted upon by your magnet.  A rod of the\r\nmetal nickel, or of the metal cobalt, from which the blue colour used\r\nby painters is derived, exhibits powers similar to those observed with\r\nthe iron and steel.\r\n\r\nIn studying the character of the force you may, however, confine\r\nyourself to iron and steel, which are always at hand. Make your\r\nexperiments with the darning-needle over and over again; operate on\r\nboth ends of the needle; try both ends of the magnet.  Do not think\r\nthe work dull; you are conversing with Nature, and must acquire over\r\nher language a certain grace and mastery, which practice can alone\r\nimpart.  Let every movement be made with care, and avoid slovenliness,\r\nfrom the outset.  Experiment, as I have said, is the language by which\r\nwe address Nature, and through which she sends her replies; in the use\r\nof this language a lack of straightforwardness is as possible, and as\r\nprejudicial, as in the spoken language of the tongue.  If, therefore,\r\nyou wish to become acquainted with the truth of Nature, you must from\r\nthe first resolve to deal with her sincerely.\r\n\r\nNow remove your needle from its loop, and draw it from eye to point\r\nalong one of the ends of the magnet; resuspend it, and repeat your\r\nformer experiment.  You now find that each extremity of the magnet\r\nattracts one end of the needle, and repels the other.  The simple\r\nattraction observed in the first instance, is now replaced by a _dual_\r\nforce.  Repeat the experiment till you have thoroughly observed the\r\nends which attract and those which repel each other.\r\n\r\nWithdraw the magnet entirely from the vicinity of your needle, and\r\nleave the latter freely suspended by its fibre.  Shelter it as well as\r\nyou can from currents of air, and if you have iron buttons on your\r\ncoat, or a steel penknife in your pocket, beware of their action.  If\r\nyou work at night, beware of iron candlesticks, or of brass ones with\r\niron rods inside.  Freed from such disturbances, the needle takes up a\r\ncertain determinate position.  It sets its length nearly north and\r\nsouth.  Draw it aside and let it go.  After several oscillations it\r\nwill again come to the same position.  If you have obtained your\r\nmagnet from a philosophical instrument maker, you will see a mark on\r\none of its ends.  Supposing, then, that you drew your needle along the\r\nend thus marked, and that the point of your needle was the last to\r\nquit the magnet, you will find that the point turns to the south, the\r\neye of the needle turning towards the north.  Make sure of this, and\r\ndo not take the statement on my authority.\r\n\r\nNow take a second darning-needle like the first, and magnetise it in\r\nprecisely the same manner: freely suspended it also will turn its eye\r\nto the north and its point to the south.  Your next step is to examine\r\nthe action of the two needles which you have thus magnetised upon each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nTake one of them in your hand, and leave the other suspended; bring\r\nthe eye-end of the former near the eye-end of the latter; the\r\nsuspended needle retreats: it is repelled.  Make the same experiment\r\nwith the two points; you obtain the same result, the suspended needle\r\nis repelled.  Now cause the dissimilar ends to act on each other--you\r\nhave attraction--point attracts eye, and eye attracts point.  Prove\r\nthe reciprocity of this action by removing the suspended needle, and\r\nputting the other in its place.  You obtain the same result.  The\r\nattraction, then, is mutual, and the repulsion U mutual.  You have\r\nthus demonstrated in the clearest manner the fundamental law of\r\nmagnetism, that like poles repel, and that unlike poles attract, each\r\nother.  You may say that this is all easily understood without doing;\r\nbut _do it_, and your knowledge will not be confined to what I have\r\nuttered here.\r\n\r\nI have said that one end of your bar magnet has a mark upon it; lay\r\nseveral silk fibres together, so as to get sufficient strength, or\r\nemploy a thin silk ribbon, and form a loop large enough to hold your\r\nmagnet.  Suspend it; it turns its marked end towards the north.  This\r\nmarked end is that which in England is called the north pole.  If a\r\ncommon smith has made your magnet, it will be convenient to determine\r\nits north pole yourself, and to mark it with a file.  Vary your\r\nexperiments by causing your magnetised darning-needle to attract and\r\nrepel your large magnet; it is quite competent to do so.  In\r\nmagnetising the needle, I have supposed the point to be the last to\r\nquit the marked end of the magnet; the point of the needle is a south\r\npole.  The end which last quits the magnet is always opposed in\r\npolarity to the end of the magnet with which it, has been last in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps learn all this in a single hour; but spend several at\r\nit, if necessary; and remember, understanding it is not sufficient:\r\nyou must obtain a manual aptitude in addressing Nature.  If you speak\r\nto your fellow-man you are not entitled to use jargon.  Bad\r\nexperiments are jargon addressed to Nature, and just as much to be\r\ndeprecated.  Manual dexterity in illustrating the interaction of\r\nmagnetic poles is of the utmost importance at this stage of your\r\nprogress; and you must not neglect attaining this power over your\r\nimplements.  As you proceed, moreover, you will be tempted to do more\r\nthan I can possibly suggest. Thoughts will occur to you which you will\r\nendeavour to follow out: questions will arise which you will try to\r\nanswer.  The same experiment may be twenty different things to twenty\r\npeople.  Having witnessed the action of pole on pole, through the air,\r\nyou will perhaps try whether the magnetic power is not to be screened\r\noff.  You use plates of glass, wood, slate, pasteboard, or\r\ngutta-percha, but find them all pervious to this wondrous force.  One\r\nmagnetic pole acts upon another through these bodies as if they were\r\nnot present.  Should you ever become a patentee for the regulation of\r\nships' compasses, you will not fall, as some projectors have done,\r\ninto the error of screening off the magnetism of the ship by the\r\ninterposition of such substances.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to teach a class you must contrive that the effects which\r\nyou have thus far witnessed for yourself shall be witnessed by twenty\r\nor thirty pupils.  And here your private ingenuity must come into\r\nplay.  You will attach bits of paper to your needles, so as to render\r\ntheir movements visible at a distance, denoting the north and south\r\npoles by different colours, say green and red.  You may also improve\r\nupon your darning-needle.  Take a strip of sheet steel, heat it to\r\nvivid redness and plunge it into cold water.  It is thereby hardened;\r\nrendered, in fact, almost as brittle as glass.  Six inches of this,\r\nmagnetised in the manner of the darning-needle, will be better able to\r\ncarry your paper indexes.  Having secured such a strip, you proceed\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nMagnetise a small sewing-needle and determine its poles; or, break\r\nhalf an inch, or an inch, off your magnetised darning-needle and\r\nsuspend it by a fine silk fibre.  The sewing-needle, or the fragment\r\nof the darning needle, is now to be used as a test-needle, to examine\r\nthe distribution of the magnetism in your strip of steel.  Hold the\r\nstrip upright in your left hand, and cause the test-needle to approach\r\nthe lower end of your strip; one end of the test-needle is attracted,\r\nthe other is repelled.  Raise your needle along the strip; its\r\noscillations, which at first were quick, become slower; opposite the\r\nmiddle of the strip they cease entirely; neither end of the needle is\r\nattracted; above the middle the test-needle turns suddenly round, its\r\nother end being now attracted.  Go through the experiment thoroughly:\r\nyou thus learn that the entire lower half of the strip attracts one\r\nend of the needle, while the entire upper half attracts the opposite\r\nend.  Supposing the north end of your little needle to be that\r\nattracted below, you infer that the entire lower half of your\r\nmagnetised strip exhibits south magnetism, while the entire upper half\r\nexhibits north magnetism.  So far, then, you have determined the\r\ndistribution of magnetism in your strip of steel.\r\n\r\nYou look at this fact, you think of it; in its suggestiveness the\r\nvalue of an experiment chiefly consists.  The thought naturally\r\narises: 'What will occur if I break my strip of steel across in the\r\nmiddle?  Shall I obtain two magnets each possessing a single pole?'\r\nTry the experiment; break your strip of steel, and test each half as\r\nyou tested the whole.  The mere presentation of its two ends in\r\nsuccession to your test-needle, suffices to show that you have _not_ a\r\nmagnet with a single pole--that each half possesses two poles with a\r\nneutral point between them.  And if you again break the half into two\r\nother halves, you will find that each quarter of the original strip\r\nexhibits precisely the same magnetic distribution as the whole strip.\r\nYou may continue the breaking process: no matter how small your\r\nfragment may be, it still possesses two opposite poles and a neutral\r\npoint between them.  Well, your hand ceases to break where breaking\r\nbecomes a mechanical impossibility; but does the mind stop there?  No:\r\nyou follow the breaking process in idea when you can no longer realise\r\nit in fact; your thoughts wander amid the very atoms of your steel,\r\nand you conclude that each atom is a magnet, and that the force\r\nexerted by the strip of steel is the mere summation, or resultant, of\r\nthe forces of its ultimate particles.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is an exhibition of power which we can call forth at\r\npleasure or cause to disappear.  We magnetise our strip, of steel by\r\ndrawing it along the pole of a magnet; we can demagnetise it, or\r\nreverse its magnetism, by properly drawing it along the same pole in\r\nthe opposite direction.  What, then, is the real nature of this\r\nwondrous change?  What is it that takes place among the atoms of the\r\nsteel when the substance is magnetised?  The question leads us beyond\r\nthe region of sense, and into that of imagination.  This faculty,\r\nindeed, is the divining-rod of the man of science.  Not, however, an\r\nimagination which catches its creations from the air, but one informed\r\nand inspired by facts; capable of seizing firmly on a physical image\r\nas a principle, of discerning its consequences, and of devising means\r\nwhereby these forecasts of thought may be brought to an experimental\r\ntest. If such a principle be adequate to account for all the\r\nphenomena--if from an assumed cause the observed acts necessarily\r\nfollow, we call the assumption a theory, and, once possessing it, we\r\ncan not only revive at pleasure facts already known, but we can\r\npredict others which we have never seen.  Thus, then, in the\r\nprosecution of physical science, our powers of observation, memory,\r\nimagination, and inference, are all drawn upon.  We observe facts and\r\nstore them up; the constructive imagination broods upon these\r\nmemories, tries to discern their interdependence and weave them to an\r\norganic whole.  The theoretic principle flashes or slowly dawns upon\r\nthe mind; and then the deductive faculty interposes to carry out the\r\nprinciple to its logical consequences.  A perfect theory gives\r\ndominion over natural facts; and even an assumption which can only\r\npartially stand the test of a comparison with facts, may be of eminent\r\nuse in enabling us to connect and classify groups of phenomena.  The\r\ntheory of magnetic fluids is of this latter character, and with it we\r\nmust now make ourselves familiar.\r\n\r\nWith the view of stamping the thing more firmly on your minds, I will\r\nmake use of a strong and vivid image.  In optics, red and green are\r\ncalled complementary colours; their mixture produces white.  Now I ask\r\nyou to imagine each of these colours to possess a self-repulsive\r\npower; that red repels red, that green repels green; but that red\r\nattracts green and green attracts red, the attraction of the\r\ndissimilar colours being equal to the repulsion of the similar ones.\r\nImagine the two colours mixed so as to produce white, and suppose two\r\nstrips of wood painted with this white-; what will be their action\r\nupon each other?  Suspend one of them freely as we suspended our\r\ndarning-needle, and bring the other near it; what will occur?  The red\r\ncomponent of the strip you hold in your hand will repel the red\r\ncomponent of your suspended strip; but then it will attract the green,\r\nand, the forces being equal, they neutralise each other.  In fact, the\r\nleast reflection shows you that the strips will be as indifferent to\r\neach other as two unmagnetised darning-needles would be under the same\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nBut suppose, instead of mixing the colours, we painted one half of\r\neach strip from centre to end red, and the other half green, it is\r\nperfectly manifest that the two strips would now behave towards each\r\nother exactly as our two magnetised darning-needles--the red end would\r\nrepel the red and attract the green, the green would repel the green\r\nand attract the red; so that, assuming two colours thus related to\r\neach other, we could by their mixture produce the neutrality of an\r\nunmagnetised body, while by their separation we could produce the\r\nduality of action of magnetised bodies.\r\n\r\nBut you have already anticipated a defect in my conception; for if we\r\nbreak one of our strips of wood in the middle we have one half\r\nentirely red, and the other entirely green, and with these it would be\r\nimpossible to imitate the action of our broken magnet.  How, then,\r\nmust we modify our conception?  We must evidently suppose _each\r\nmolecule of the wood_ painted green on one face and red on the opposite\r\none.  The resultant action of all the atoms would then exactly\r\nresemble the action of a magnet.  Here also, if the two opposite\r\ncolours of each atom could be caused to mix so as to produce white, we\r\nshould have, as before, perfect neutrality.\r\n\r\nFor these two self-repellent and mutually attractive colours,\r\nsubstitute in your minds two invisible self-repellent and mutually\r\nattractive fluids, which in ordinary steel are mixed to form a neutral\r\ncompound, but which the act of magnetisation separates from each\r\nother, placing the opposite fluids on the opposite face of each\r\nmolecule.  You have then a perfectly distinct conception of the\r\ncelebrated theory of magnetic fluids.  The strength of the magnetism\r\nexcited is supposed to be proportional to the quantity of neutral\r\nfluid decomposed.  According to this theory nothing is actually\r\ntransferred from the exciting magnet to the excited steel.  The act of\r\nmagnetisation consists in the forcible separation of two fluids which\r\nexisted in the steel before it was magnetised, but which then\r\nneutralised each other by their coalescence.  And if you test your\r\nmagnet, after it has excited a hundred pieces of steel, you will find\r\nthat it has lost no force--no more, indeed, than I should lose, had my\r\nwords such a magnetic influence on your minds as to excite in them a\r\nstrong resolve to study natural philosophy.  I should rather be the\r\ngainer by my own utterance, and by the reaction of your fervour.  The\r\nmagnet also is the gainer by the reaction of the body which it\r\nmagnetises.\r\n\r\nLook now to your excited piece of steel; figure each molecule with its\r\nopposed fluids spread over its opposite faces.  How can this state of\r\nthings be permanent?  The fluids, by hypothesis, attract each other;\r\nwhat, then, keeps them apart?  Why do they not instantly rush together\r\nacross the equator of the atom, and thus neutralise each other?  To\r\nmeet this question philosophers have been obliged to infer the\r\nexistence of a special force, which holds the fluids asunder.  They\r\ncall it _coercive force_; and it is found that those kinds of steel\r\nwhich offer most resistance to being magnetised--which require the\r\ngreatest amount of 'coercion' to tear their fluids asunder--are the\r\nvery ones which offer the greatest resistance to the reunion of the\r\nfluids, after they have been once separated.  Such kinds of steel are\r\nmost suited to the formation of _permanent_ magnets.  It is manifest,\r\nindeed, that without coercive force a permanent magnet would not be at\r\nall possible.\r\n\r\nProbably long before this you will have dipped the end of your magnet\r\namong iron filings, and observed how they cling to it; or into a\r\nnail-box, and found how it drags the nails after it.  I know very well\r\nthat if you are not the slaves of routine, you will have by this time\r\ndone many things that I have not told you to do, and thus multiplied\r\nyour experience beyond what I have indicated.  You are almost sure to\r\nhave caused a bit of iron to hang from the end of your magnet, and you\r\nhave probably succeeded in causing a second bit to attach itself to\r\nthe first, a third to the second; until finally the force has become\r\ntoo feeble to bear the weight of more.  If you have operated with\r\nnails, you may have observed that the points and edges hold together\r\nwith the greatest tenacity; and that a bit of iron clings more firmly\r\nto the corner of your magnet than to one of its flat surfaces.  In\r\nshort, you will in all likelihood have enriched your experience in\r\nmany ways without any special direction from me.\r\n\r\nWell, the magnet attracts the nail, and the nail attracts a second\r\none.  This proves that the nail in contact with the magnet has had the\r\nmagnetic quality developed in it by that contact.  If it be withdrawn\r\nfrom the magnet its power to attract its fellow nail ceases.  Contact,\r\nhowever, is not necessary.  A sheet of glass or paper, or a space of\r\nair, may exist between the magnet and the nail; the latter is still\r\nmagnetised, though not so forcibly as when in actual contact.  The\r\nnail thus presented to the magnet is itself a temporary magnet.  That\r\nend which is turned towards the magnetic pole has the opposite\r\nmagnetism of the pole which excites it; the end most remote from the\r\npole has the same magnetism as the pole itself, and between the two\r\npoles the nail, like the magnet, possesses a magnetic equator.\r\n\r\nConversant as you now are with the theory of magnetic fluids, you have\r\nalready, I doubt not, anticipated me in imagining the exact condition\r\nof an iron nail under the influence of the magnet.  You picture the\r\niron as possessing the neutral fluid in abundance; you picture the\r\nmagnetic pole, when brought near, decomposing the fluid; repelling the\r\nfluid of a like kind with itself, and attracting the unlike fluid;\r\nthus exciting in the parts of the iron nearest to itself the opposite\r\npolarity.  But the iron is incapable of becoming a permanent magnet.\r\nIt only shows its virtue as long as the magnet acts upon it.  What,\r\nthen, does the iron lack which the steel possesses?  It lacks coercive\r\nforce.  Its fluids are separated with ease; but, once the separating\r\ncause is removed, they flow together again, and neutrality is\r\nrestored.  Imagination must be quite nimble in picturing these\r\nchanges--able to see the fluids dividing and reuniting, according as\r\nthe magnet is brought near or withdrawn.  Fixing a definite pole in\r\nyour mind, you must picture the precise arrangement of the two fluids\r\nwith reference to this pole, and be able to arouse similar pictures in\r\nthe minds of your pupils.  You will cause them to place magnets and\r\niron in various positions, and describe the exact magnetic state of\r\nthe iron in each particular case.  The mere facts of magnetism will\r\nhave their interest immensely augmented by an acquaintance with the\r\nprinciples whereon the facts depend.  Still, while you use this theory\r\nof magnetic fluids to track out the phenomena and link them together,\r\nyou will not forget to tell your pupils that it is to be regarded as a\r\nsymbol merely,--a symbol, moreover, which is incompetent to cover all\r\nthe facts, but which does good practical service whilst we are waiting\r\nfor the actual truth. [Footnote: This theory breaks down when applied\r\nto diamagnetic bodies which are repelled by magnets.  Like soft iron,\r\nsuch bodies are thrown into a state of temporary excitement, in virtue\r\nof which they are repelled; but any attempt to explain such a\r\nrepulsion by the decomposition of a fluid will demonstrate its own\r\nfutility.]\r\n\r\nThe state of excitement into which iron is thrown by the influence, of\r\na magnet, is sometimes called 'magnetisation by influence.' More\r\ncommonly, however, the magnetism is said to be 'induced' in the iron,\r\nand hence this mode of magnetising is called 'magnetic induction.'\r\nNow, there is nothing theoretically perfect in Nature: there is no\r\niron so soft as not to possess a certain amount of coercive force, and\r\nno steel so hard as not to be capable, in some degree, of magnetic\r\ninduction.  The quality of steel is in some measure possessed by iron,\r\nand the quality of iron is shared in some degree by steel.  It is in\r\nvirtue of this latter fact that the unmagnetised darning-needle was\r\nattracted in your first experiment; and from this you may at once\r\ndeduce the consequence that, after the steel has been magnetised, the\r\nrepulsive action of a magnet must be always less than its attractive\r\naction.  For the repulsion is opposed by the inductive action of the\r\nmagnet on the steel, while the attraction is assisted by the same\r\ninductive action.  Make this clear to your minds, and verify it by\r\nyour experiments.  In some cases you can actually make the attraction\r\ndue to the temporary magnetism overbalance the repulsion due to the\r\npermanent magnetism, and thus cause two poles of the same kind\r\napparently to attract each other.  When, however, good hard magnets\r\nact on each other from a sufficient distance, the inductive action\r\npractically vanishes, and the repulsion of like poles is sensibly\r\nequal to the attraction of unlike ones.\r\n\r\nI dwell thus long on elementary principles, because they are of the\r\nfirst importance, and it is the temptation of this age of unhealthy\r\ncramming to neglect them.  Now follow me a little farther.  In\r\nexamining the distribution of magnetism in your strip of steel you\r\nraised the needle slowly from bottom to top, and found what we called\r\na neutral point at the centre.\r\n\r\nNow does the magnet really exert no influence on the pole presented to\r\nits centre?  Let us see.\r\n\r\nLet SN, fig. 13, be our magnet, and let n represent a particle of\r\nnorth magnetism placed exactly opposite the middle of the magnet.  Of\r\ncourse this is an imaginary case, as you can never in reality thus\r\ndetach your north magnetism from its neighbour.  But supposing us to\r\nhave done so, what would be the action of the two poles of the magnet\r\non n?  Your reply will of course be that the pole S attracts n while\r\nthe pole N repels it.  Let the magnitude and direction of the\r\nattraction be expressed by the line n m, and the magnitude and\r\ndirection of the repulsion by the line n o.  Now, the particle n being\r\nequally distant from s and N, the line n o, expressing the repulsion,\r\nwill be equal to m n, which expresses the attraction.  Acted upon by\r\ntwo such forces, the particle n must evidently move in the direction n\r\np, exactly midway between m n and n o.  Hence you see that, although\r\nthere is no tendency of the particle n to move towards the magnetic\r\nequator, there is a tendency on its part to move parallel to the\r\nmagnet.  If, instead of a particle of north magnetism, we placed a\r\nparticle of south magnetism opposite to the magnetic equator, it would\r\nevidently be urged along the line n q; and if, instead of two separate\r\nparticles of magnetism, we place a little magnetic needle, containing\r\nboth north and south magnetism, opposite the magnetic equator, its\r\nsouth pole being urged along n q, and its north along n p, the little\r\nneedle will be compelled to set itself parallel to the magnet s N.\r\nMake the experiment, and satisfy yourselves that this is a true\r\ndeduction.\r\n\r\nSubstitute for your magnetic needle a bit of iron wire, devoid of\r\npermanent magnetism, and it will set itself exactly as the needle\r\ndoes.  Acted upon by the magnet, the wire, as you know, becomes a\r\nmagnet and behaves as such; it will turn its north pole towards p, and\r\nsouth pole towards q, just like the needle.\r\n\r\nBut supposing you shift the position of your particle of north\r\nmagnetism, and bring it nearer to one end of your magnet than to the\r\nother; the forces acting on the particle are no longer equal; the\r\nnearest pole of the magnet will act more powerfully on the particle\r\nthan the more distant one.  Let SN, fig. 14, be the magnet, and n the\r\nparticle of north magnetism, in its new position.  It is repelled by\r\nN, and attracted by S.  Let the repulsion be represented in magnitude\r\nand direction by the line n o, and the attraction by the shorter line\r\nn M. The resultant of these two forces will be found by completing the\r\nparallelogram m n o p, and drawing its diagonal n p.  Along n p, then,\r\na particle of north magnetism would be urged by the simultaneous\r\naction of S and N.  Substituting a particle of south magnetism for n,\r\nthe same reasoning would lead to the conclusion that the particle\r\nwould be urged along it q.  If we place at n a short magnetic needle,\r\nits north pole will be urged along n p, its south pole along n q, the\r\nonly position possible to the needle, thus acted on, being along the\r\nline p q, which is no longer parallel to the magnet.  Verify this\r\ndeduction by actual experiment.\r\n\r\nIn this way we might go round the entire magnet; and, considering its\r\ntwo poles as two centres from which the force emanates, we could, in\r\naccordance with ordinary mechanical principles, assign a definite\r\ndirection to the magnetic needle at every particular place.  And\r\nsubstituting, as before, a bit of iron wire for the magnetic needle,\r\nthe positions of both will be the same.\r\n\r\nNow, I think, without further preface, you will be able' to comprehend\r\nfor yourselves, and explain to others, one of the most interesting\r\neffects in the whole domain of magnetism.  Iron filings you know are\r\nparticles of iron, irregular in shape, being longer in some directions\r\nthan in others.  For the present experiment, moreover, instead of the\r\niron filings, very small scraps of thin iron wire might be employed. I\r\nplace a sheet of paper over the magnet; it is all the better if the\r\npaper be stretched on a wooden frame as this enables us to keep it\r\nquite level.  I scatter the filings, or the scraps of wire, from a\r\nsieve upon the paper, and tap the latter gently, so as to liberate the\r\nparticles for a moment from its friction.  The magnet acts on the\r\nfilings through the paper, and see how it arranges them!  They\r\nembrace the magnet in a series of beautiful curves, which are\r\ntechnically called 'magnetic curves,' or 'lines of magnetic force.'\r\nDoes the meaning of these lines yet flash upon you?  Set your magnetic\r\nneedle, or your suspended bit of wire, at any point of one of the\r\ncurves, and you will find the direction of the needle, or of the wire,\r\nto be exactly that of the particle of iron, or of the magnetic curve,\r\nat that point.  Go round and round the magnet; the direction of your\r\nneedle always coincides with the direction of the curve on which it is\r\nplaced.  These, then, are the lines along which a particle of south\r\nmagnetism, if you could detach it, would move to the north pole, and a\r\nbit of north magnetism to the south pole.  They are the lines along\r\nwhich the decomposition of the neutral fluid takes place.  In the case\r\nof the magnetic needle, one of its poles being urged in one direction,\r\nand the other pole in the opposite direction, the needle must\r\nnecessarily set itself as a _tangent_ to the curve.  I will not seek to\r\nsimplify this subject further.  If there be anything obscure or\r\nconfused or incomplete in my statement, you ought now, by patient\r\nthought, to be able to clear away the obscurity, to reduce the\r\nconfusion to order, and to supply what is needed to render the\r\nexplanation complete.  Do not quit the subject until you thoroughly\r\nunderstand it; and if you are then able to look with your mind's eye\r\nat the play of forces around a magnet, and see distinctly the\r\noperation of those forces in the production of the magnetic curves,\r\nthe time which we have spent together will not have been spent in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nFIG.  15.\r\n\r\nIn this thorough manner we must master our materials, reason upon\r\nthem, and, by determined study, attain to clearness of conception.\r\nFacts thus dealt with exercise an expansive force upon the intellect;\r\nthey widen the mind to generalisation.  We soon recognise a\r\nbrotherhood between the larger phenomena of Nature and the minute\r\neffects which we have observed in our private chambers.  Why, we\r\nenquire, does the magnetic needle set north and south?  Evidently it\r\nis compelled to do so by the earth; the great globe which we inherit\r\nis itself a magnet.  Let us learn a little more about it.  By means of\r\na bit of wax, or otherwise, attach the end of your silk fibre to the\r\nmiddle point of your magnetic needle; the needle will thus be\r\nuninterfered with by the paper loop, and will enjoy to some extent a\r\npower of dipping' its point, or its eye, below the horizon.  Lay your\r\nbar magnet on a table, and hold the needle over the equator of the\r\nmagnet.  The needle sets horizontal.  Move it towards the north end of\r\nthe magnet; the south end of the needle dips, the dip augmenting as\r\nyou approach the north pole, over which the needle, if free to move,\r\nwill set itself exactly vertical.  Move it back to the centre, it\r\nresumes its horizontality; pass it on towards the south pole, its\r\nnorth end now dips, and directly over the south pole the needle\r\nbecomes vertical, its north end being now turned downwards.  Thus we\r\nlearn that on the one side of the magnetic equator the north end of\r\nthe needle dips; on the other side the south end dips, the dip varying\r\nfrom nothing to 90°.  If we go to the equatorial regions of the earth\r\nwith a suitably suspended needle we shall find there the position of\r\nthe needle horizontal.  If we sail north one end of the needle dips;\r\nif we sail south the opposite end dips; and over the north or south\r\nterrestrial magnetic pole the needle sets vertical.  The south\r\nmagnetic pole has not yet been found, but Sir James Ross discovered\r\nthe north magnetic pole on June 1, 1831.  In this manner we establish\r\na complete parallelism between the action of the earth and that of an\r\nordinary magnet.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial magnetic poles do not coincide with the geographical\r\nones; nor does the earth's magnetic equator quite coincide with the\r\ngeographical equator.  The direction of the magnetic needle in London,\r\nwhich is called the magnetic meridian, encloses an angle of 24° with\r\nthe astronomical meridian, this angle being called the Declination of\r\nthe needle for London.  The north, pole of the needle now lies to the\r\nwest of the true meridian; the declination is westerly.  In the year\r\n1660, however, the declination was nothing, while before that time it\r\nwas easterly.  All this proves that the earth's magnetic constituents\r\nare gradually changing their distribution.  This change is very slow:\r\nit is therefore called the secular change, and the observation of it\r\nhas not yet extended over a sufficient period to enable us to guess,\r\neven approximately, at its laws.\r\n\r\nHaving thus discovered, to some extent, the secret of the earth's\r\nmagnetic power, we can turn it to account.  In the line of 'dip' I\r\nhold a poker formed of good soft iron.  The earth, acting as a magnet,\r\nis at this moment constraining the two fluids of the poker to\r\nseparate, making the lower end of the poker a north pole, and the\r\nupper end a south pole.  Mark the experiment: When the knob is\r\nuppermost, it attracts the north end of a magnetic needle; when\r\nundermost it attracts the south end of a magnetic needle.  With such a\r\npoker repeat this experiment and satisfy yourselves that the fluids\r\nshift their position according to the manner in which the poker is\r\npresented to the earth.  It has already been stated that the softest\r\niron possesses a certain amount of coercive force.  The earth, at this\r\nmoment, finds in this force an antagonist which opposes the\r\ndecomposition of the neutral fluid, The component fluids may be\r\nfigured as meeting an amount of friction, or possessing an amount of\r\nadhesion, which prevents them from gliding over the molecules of the\r\npoker.  Can we assist the earth in this case?  If we wish to remove\r\nthe residue of a powder from the interior surface of a glass to which\r\nthe powder clings, we invert the glass, tap it, loosen the hold of the\r\npowder, and thus enable the force of gravity to pull it down.  So also\r\nby tapping the end of the poker we 'loosen the adhesion of the\r\nmagnetic fluids to the molecules and enable the earth to pull them\r\napart.  But, what is the consequence?  The portion of fluid which has\r\nbeen thus forcibly dragged over the molecules refuses to return when\r\nthe poker has been removed from the line of dip; the iron, as you see,\r\nhas become a permanent magnet.  By reversing its position and tapping\r\nit again we reverse its magnetism.  A thoughtful and competent teacher\r\nwill know how to place these remarkable facts before his pupils in a\r\nmanner which will excite their interest. By the use of sensible\r\nimages, more or less gross, he will first give those whom he teaches\r\ndefinite conceptions, purifying these conceptions afterwards, as the\r\nminds of his pupils become more capable of abstraction.  By thus\r\ngiving them a distinct substratum for their reasonings, he will confer\r\nupon his pupils a profit and a joy which the mere exhibition of facts\r\nwithout principles, or the appeal to the bodily senses and the power\r\nof memory alone, could never inspire.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAs an expansion of the note on magnetic fluids, the following extract\r\nmay find a place here: 'It is well known that a voltaic current\r\nexerts an attractive force upon a second current, flowing in the same\r\ndirection; and that when the directions are opposed to each other the\r\nforce exerted is a repulsive one.  By coiling wires into spirals,\r\nAmpère was enabled to make them produce all the phenomena of\r\nattraction and repulsion exhibited by magnets, and from this it was\r\nbut a step to his celebrated theory of molecular currents.  He\r\nsupposed the molecules of a magnetic body to be surrounded by such\r\ncurrents, which, however, in the natural state of the body mutually\r\nneutralised each other, on account of their confused grouping.  The\r\nact of magnetisation he supposed to consist in setting these molecular\r\ncurrents parallel to each other; and, starting from this principle, he\r\nreduced all the phenomena of magnetism to the mutual action of\r\nelectric currents.\r\n\r\n'If we reflect upon the experiments recorded in the foregoing pages\r\nfrom first to last, we can hardly fail to be convinced that\r\ndiamagnetic bodies operated on by magnetic forces possess a polarity\r\n\"the same in kind as, but the reverse in direction of, that acquired\r\nby magnetic bodies.\" But if this be the case, how are we to conceive\r\nthe _physical mechanism_ of this polarity?  According to Coulomb's and\r\nPoisson's theory, the act of magnetisation consists in the\r\ndecomposition of a neutral magnetic fluid; the north pole of a magnet,\r\nfor example, possesses an attraction for the south fluid of a piece of\r\nsoft iron submitted to its influence, draws the said fluid towards it,\r\nand with it the material particles with which the fluid is associated.\r\nTo account for diamagnetic phenomena this theory seems to fail\r\naltogether; according to it, indeed, the oft-used phrase, \"a north\r\npole exciting a north pole, and a south pole a south pole,\" involves a\r\ncontradiction.  For if the north fluid be supposed to be _attracted_\r\ntowards the influencing north pole, it is absurd to suppose that its\r\npresence there could produce _repulsion_.  The theory of Ampère is\r\nequally at a loss to explain diamagnetic action; for if we suppose the\r\nparticles of bismuth surrounded by molecular currents, then, according\r\nto all that is known of electrodynamic laws, these currents would set\r\nthemselves parallel to, and in the same direction as, those of the\r\nmagnet, and hence attraction, and not repulsion, would be the result.\r\nThe fact, however, of this not being the case, proves that these\r\nmolecular currents are not the mechanism by which diamagnetic\r\ninduction is effected.  The consciousness of this, I doubt not, drove\r\nM. Weber to the assumption that the phenomena of diamagnetism are\r\nproduced by molecular currents, not _directed_, but actually _excited_ in\r\nthe bismuth by the magnet.  Such induced currents would, according to\r\nknown laws, have a direction opposed to those of the inducing magnet,\r\nand hence would produce the phenomena of repulsion.  To carry out the\r\nassumption here made, M. Weber is obliged to suppose that the\r\nmolecules of diamagnetic bodies are surrounded by channels, in which\r\nthe induced molecular currents, once excited, continue to flow without\r\nresistance.' [Footnote: In assuming these non-resisting channels M.\r\nWeber, it must be admitted, did not go beyond the assumptions of\r\nAmpère.]--Diamagnetism and Magne-crystallic Action, p. 136-7.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXVI.  ON FORCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A discourse delivered in the Royal Institution, June 6,\r\n1862.]\r\n\r\nA SPHERE of lead was suspended at a height of 16 feet above the\r\ntheatre floor of the Royal Institution.  It was liberated, and fell by\r\ngravity.  That weight required a second to fall to the floor from that\r\nelevation; and the instant before it touched the floor, it had a\r\nvelocity of 32 feet a second.  That is to say, if at that instant the\r\nearth were annihilated, and its attraction annulled, the weight would\r\nproceed through space at the uniform velocity of 32 feet a second.\r\n\r\nIf instead of being pulled downward by gravity, the weight be cast\r\nupward in opposition to gravity, then, to reach a height of 16 feet it\r\nmust start with a velocity of 32 feet a second.  This velocity\r\nimparted to the weight by the human hand, or by any other mechanical\r\nmeans, would carry it to the precise height from which we saw it fall.\r\n\r\nNow the lifting of the weight may be regarded as so much mechanical\r\nwork performed.  By means of a ladder placed against the wall, the\r\nweight might be carried up to a height of 16 feet; or it might be\r\ndrawn up to this height by means of a string and pulley, or it might\r\nbe suddenly jerked up to a height of 16 feet.  The amount of work done\r\nin all these cases, as far as the raising of the weight is concerned,\r\nwould be absolutely the same.  The work done at one and the same\r\nplace, and neglecting the small change of gravity with the height,\r\ndepends solely upon two things; on the quantity of matter lifted, and\r\non the height to which it is lifted.  If we call the quantity or mass\r\nof matter m, and the height through which it is lifted h, then the\r\nproduct of m into h, or mh, expresses, or is proportional to, the\r\namount of work done.\r\n\r\nSupposing, instead of imparting a velocity of 32 feet a second we\r\nimpart at starting twice this velocity.  To what height will the\r\nweight rise?  You might be disposed to answer, 'To twice the height;'\r\nbut this would be quite incorrect.  Instead of twice 16, or 32 feet,\r\nit would reach a height of four times 16, or 64 feet.  So also, if we\r\ntreble the starting velocity, the weight would reach nine times the\r\nheight; if we quadruple the speed at starting, we attain sixteen times\r\nthe height.  Thus, with a four-fold velocity of 128 feet a second at\r\nstarting, the weight would attain an elevation of 256 feet.  With a\r\nseven-fold velocity at starting, the weight would rise to 49 times the\r\nheight, or to an elevation of 784 feet.\r\n\r\nNow the work done--or, as it is sometimes called, the _mechanical\r\neffect_--other things being constant, is, as before explained,\r\nproportional to the height, and as a double velocity gives four times\r\nthe height, a treble velocity nine times the height, and so on, it is\r\nperfectly plain that the mechanical effect increases as the square of\r\nthe velocity.  If the mass of the body be represented by the letter m,\r\nand its velocity by v, the mechanical effect would be proportional to\r\nor represented by m v2.  In the case considered, I have supposed the\r\nweight to be cast upward, being opposed in its flight by the\r\nresistance of gravity; but the same holds true if the projectile be\r\nsent into water, mud, earth, timber, or other resisting material.  If,\r\nfor example, we double the velocity of a cannon-ball, we quadruple its\r\nmechanical effect.  Hence the importance of augmenting the velocity of\r\na projectile, and hence the philosophy of Sir William Armstrong in\r\nusing a large charge of powder in his recent striking experiments.\r\n\r\nThe measure then of mechanical effect is the mass of the body\r\nmultiplied by the square of its velocity.\r\n\r\nNow in firing a ball against a target the projectile, after collision,\r\nis often found hot.  Mr. Fairbairn informs me that in the experiments\r\nat Shoeburyness it is a common thing to see a flash, even in broad\r\ndaylight, when the ball strikes the target.  And if our lead weight be\r\nexamined after it has fallen from a height it is also found heated.\r\nNow here experiment and reasoning lead us to the remarkable law that,\r\nlike the mechanical effect, the amount of heat generated is\r\nproportional to the product of the mass into the square of the\r\nvelocity.  Double your mass, other things being equal, and you double\r\nyour amount of heat; double your velocity, other things remaining\r\nequal, and you quadruple your amount of heat.  Here then we have\r\ncommon mechanical motion destroyed and heat produced.  When a violin\r\nbow is drawn across a string, the sound produced is due to motion\r\nimparted to the air, and to produce that motion muscular force has\r\nbeen expended.  We may here correctly say, that the mechanical force\r\nof the arm is converted into music.  In a similar way we say that the\r\narrested motion of our descending weight, or of the cannon-ball, is\r\nconverted into heat.  The mode of motion changes, but motion still\r\ncontinues; the motion of the mass is converted into a motion of the\r\natoms of the mass; and these small motions, communicated to the\r\nnerves, produce the sensation we call heat.\r\n\r\nWe know the amount of heat which a given amount of mechanical force\r\ncan develope.  Our lead ball, for example, in falling to the earth\r\ngenerated a quantity of heat sufficient to raise its own temperature\r\nthree-fifths of a Fahrenheit degree.  It reached the earth with a\r\nvelocity of 32 feet a second, and forty times this velocity would be\r\nsmall for a rifle bullet; multiplying 0.6 by the square of 40, we find\r\nthat the amount of heat developed by collision with the target would,\r\nif wholly concentrated in the lead, raise its temperature 960 degrees.\r\nThis would be more than sufficient to fuse the lead.  In reality,\r\nhowever, the heat developed is divided between the lead and the body\r\nagainst which it strikes; nevertheless, it would be worth while to pay\r\nattention to this point, and to ascertain whether rifle bullets do\r\nnot, under some circumstances, show signs of fusion. [Footnote: Eight\r\nyears subsequently this surmise was proved correct.  In the\r\nFranco-German War signs of fusion were observed in the case of bullets\r\nimpinging on bones.]\r\n\r\nFrom the motion of sensible masses, by gravity and other means, we now\r\npass to the motion of atoms towards each other by chemical affinity. A\r\ncollodion balloon filled with a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen being\r\nhung in the focus of a parabolic mirror, in the focus of a second\r\nmirror 20 feet distant a strong electric light was suddenly generated;\r\nthe instant the concentrated light fell upon the balloon, the gases\r\nwithin it exploded, hydrochloric acid being the result. Here the atoms\r\nvirtually fell together, the amount of heat produced showing the\r\nenormous force of the collision.  The burning of charcoal in oxygen is\r\nan old experiment, but it has now a significance beyond what it used\r\nto have; we now regard the act of combination on the part of the atoms\r\nof oxygen and coal as we regard the clashing of a falling weight\r\nagainst the earth.  The heat produced in both cases is referable to a\r\ncommon cause.  A diamond, which burns in oxygen as a star of white\r\nlight, glows and burns in consequence of the falling of the atoms of\r\noxygen against it.  And could we measure the velocity of the atoms\r\nwhen they clash, and could we find their number and weights,\r\nmultiplying the weight of each atom by the square of its velocity, and\r\nadding all together, we should get a number representing the exact\r\namount of heat developed by the union of the oxygen and carbon.\r\n\r\nThus far we have regarded the heat developed by the clashing of\r\nsensible masses and of atoms.  Work is expended in giving motion to\r\nthese atoms or masses, and heat is developed.  But we reverse this\r\nprocess daily, and by the expenditure of heat execute work.  We can\r\nraise a weight by heat; and in this agent we possess an enormous store\r\nof mechanical power.  A pound of coal produces by its combination with\r\noxygen an amount of heat which, if mechanically applied, would suffice\r\nto raise a weight of 100 lbs. to a height of 20 miles above the\r\nearth's surface.  Conversely, 100 lbs. falling from a height of 20\r\nmiles, and striking against 'the earth, would generate an amount of\r\nheat equal to that developed by the combustion of a pound of coal.\r\nWherever work is done by heat, heat disappears.  A gun which fires a\r\nball is less heated than one which fires blank cartridge.  The\r\nquantity of heat communicated to the boiler of a working steam-engine\r\nis greater than that which could be obtained from the re-condensation\r\nof the steam, after it had done its work; and the amount of work\r\nperformed is the exact equivalent of the amount of heat lost. Mr.\r\nSmyth informed us in his interesting discourse, that we dig annually\r\n84 millions of tons of coal from our pits.  The amount of mechanical\r\nforce represented by this quantity of coal seems perfectly fabulous.\r\nThe combustion of a single pound of coal, supposing it to take place\r\nin a minute, would be equivalent to the work of 300 horses; and if we\r\nsuppose 108 millions of horses working day and night with unimpaired\r\nstrength, for a year, their united energies would enable them to\r\nperform an amount of work just equivalent to that which the annual\r\nproduce of our coal-fields would be able to accomplish.\r\n\r\nComparing with ordinary gravity the force with which oxygen and carbon\r\nunite together, chemical affinity seems almost infinite.  But let us\r\ngive gravity fair play by permitting it to act throughout its entire\r\nrange.  Place a body at such a distance from the earth that the\r\nattraction of our planet is barely sensible, and let it fall to the\r\nearth from this distance.  It would reach the earth with a final\r\nvelocity of 36,747 feet a second; and on collision with the earth the\r\nbody would generate about twice the amount of heat generated by the\r\ncombustion of an equal weight of coal.  We have stated that by falling\r\nthrough a space of 16 feet our lead bullet would be heated\r\nthree-fifths of a degree; but a body falling from an infinite distance\r\nhas already used up 1,299,999 parts out of 1,300,000 of the earth's\r\npulling power, when it has arrived within 16 feet of the surface; on\r\nthis space only 1/1,300,000 of the whole force is exerted.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our thoughts for a moment from the earth to the sun.\r\nThe researches of Sir John Herschel and M. Pouillet have informed us\r\nof the annual expenditure of the sun as regards heat; and by an easy\r\ncalculation we ascertain the precise amount of the expenditure which\r\nfalls to the share of our planet.  Out of 2300 million parts of light\r\nand heat the earth receives one.  The whole heat emitted by the sun in\r\na minute would be competent to boil 12,000 millions of cubic miles of\r\nice-cold water.  How is this enormous loss made good--whence is the\r\nsun's heat derived, and by what means is it maintained?  No\r\ncombustion--no chemical affinity with which we are acquainted, would\r\nbe competent to produce the temperature of the sun's surface.\r\nBesides, were the sun a burning body merely, its light and heat would\r\nspeedily come to an end.  Supposing it to be a solid globe of coal,\r\nits combustion would only cover 4600 years of expenditure.  In this\r\nshort time it would burn itself out.  What agency then can produce the\r\ntemperature and maintain the outlay?  We have already regarded the\r\ncase of a body falling from a great distance towards the earth, and\r\nfound that the heat generated by its collision would be twice that\r\nproduced by the combustion of an equal weight of coal.  How much\r\ngreater must be the heat developed by a body falling against the sun!\r\nThe maximum velocity with which a body can strike the earth is about 7\r\nmiles in a second; the maximum velocity with which it can strike the\r\nsun is 390 miles in a second.  And as the heat developed by the\r\ncollision is proportional to the square of the velocity destroyed, an\r\nasteroid falling into the sun with the above velocity would generate\r\nabout 10,000 times the quantity of heat produced by the combustion of\r\nan asteroid of coal of the same weight.\r\n\r\nHave we any reason to believe that such bodies exist in space, and\r\nthat they may be raining down upon the sun?  The meteorites flashing\r\nthrough the air are small planetary bodies, drawn by the earth's\r\nattraction.  They enter our atmosphere with planetary velocity, and by\r\nfriction against the air they are raised to incandescence and caused\r\nto emit light and heat.  At certain seasons of the year they shower\r\ndown upon us in great numbers.  In Boston 240,000 of them were\r\nobserved in nine hours.  There is no reason to suppose that the\r\nplanetary system is limited to 'vast masses of enormous weight;' there\r\nis, on the contrary, reason to believe that space is stocked with\r\nsmaller masses, which obey the same laws as the larger ones.  That\r\nlenticular envelope which surrounds the sun, and which is known to\r\nastronomers as the Zodiacal light, is probably a crowd of meteors; and\r\nmoving as they do in a resisting medium, they must continually\r\napproach the sun.  Falling into it, they would produce enormous heat,\r\nand this would constitute a source from which the annual loss of heat\r\nmight be made good.  The sun, according to this hypothesis, would\r\ncontinually grow larger; but how much larger?  Were our moon to fall\r\ninto the sun, it would develope an amount of heat sufficient to cover\r\none or two years' loss; and were our earth to fall into the sun a\r\ncentury's loss would be made good.  Still, our moon and our earth, if\r\ndistributed over the surface of the sun, would utterly vanish from\r\nperception.  Indeed, the quantity of matter competent to produce the\r\nrequired effect would, during the range of history, cause no\r\nappreciable augmentation in the sun's magnitude.  The augmentation of\r\nthe sun's attractive force would be more sensible.  However this\r\nhypothesis may fare as a representant of what is going on in nature,\r\nit certainly shows how a sun _might_ be formed and maintained on known\r\nthermo-dynamic principles.\r\n\r\nOur earth moves in its orbit with a velocity of 68,040 miles an hour.\r\nWere this motion stopped, an amount of heat would be developed\r\nsufficient to raise the temperature of a globe of lead of the same\r\nsize as the earth 384,000 degrees of the centigrade thermometer.  It\r\nhas been prophesied that 'the elements shall melt with fervent heat.'\r\nThe earth's own motion embraces the conditions of fulfilment; stop\r\nthat motion, and the greater part, if not the whole, of our planet\r\nwould be reduced to vapour.  If the earth fell into the sun, the\r\namount of heat developed by the shock would be equal to that developed\r\nby the combustion of a mass of solid coal 6435 times the earth in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThere is one other consideration connected with the permanence of our\r\npresent terrestrial conditions, which is well worthy of our attention.\r\nStanding upon one of, the London bridges, we observe the current of\r\nthe Thames reversed, and the water poured upward twice a-day.  The\r\nwater thus moved rubs against the river's bed, and heat is the\r\nconsequence of this friction.  The heat thus generated is in part\r\nradiated into space and lost, as far as the earth is concerned.  What\r\nsupplies this incessant loss?  The earth's rotation.  Let us look a\r\nlittle more closely at the matter.  Imagine the moon fixed, and the\r\nearth turning like a wheel from west to east in its diurnal rotation.\r\nSuppose a high mountain on the earth's surface approaching the earth's\r\nmeridian; that mountain is, as it were, laid hold of by the moon; it\r\nforms a kind of handle by which the earth is pulled more quickly\r\nround.  But when the meridian is passed the pull of the moon on the\r\nmountain would be in the opposite direction, it would tend to diminish\r\nthe velocity of rotation as much as it previously augmented it; thus\r\nthe action of all fixed bodies on the earth's surface is neutralised.\r\nBut suppose the mountain to lie always to the east of the moon's\r\nmeridian, the pull then would be always exerted against the earth's\r\nrotation, the velocity of which would be diminished in a degree\r\ncorresponding to the strength of the pull.  _The tidal wave occupies\r\nthis position_--it lies always to the east of the moon's meridian. The\r\nwaters of the ocean are in part dragged as a brake along the surface\r\nof the earth; and as a brake they must diminish the velocity of the\r\nearth's rotation. [Footnote: Kant surmised an action of this kind.]\r\nSupposing then that we turn a mill by the action of the tide, and\r\nproduce heat by the friction of the millstones; that heat has an\r\norigin totally different from the heat produced by another mill which\r\nis turned by a mountain stream.  The former is produced at the expense\r\nof the earth's rotation, the latter at the expense of the sun's\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\nThe sun, by the act of vaporisation, lifts mechanically all the\r\nmoisture of our air, which when it condenses falls in the form of\r\nrain, and when it freezes falls as snow.  In this solid form it is\r\npiled upon the Alpine heights, and furnishes materials for glaciers.\r\nBut the sun again interposes, liberates the solidified liquid, and\r\npermits it to roll by gravity to the sea.  The mechanical force of\r\nevery river in the world as it rolls towards the ocean, is drawn from\r\nthe heat of the sun.  No streamlet glides to a lower level without\r\nhaving been first lifted to the elevation from which it springs by the\r\npower of the sun.  The energy of winds is also due entirely to the\r\nsame power.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another work which the sun performs, and its\r\nconnection with which is not so obvious.  Trees and vegetables grow\r\nupon the earth, and when burned they give rise to heat, and hence to\r\nmechanical energy.  Whence is this power derived?  You see this oxide\r\nof iron, produced by the falling together of the atoms of iron and\r\noxygen; you cannot see this transparent carbonic acid gas, formed by\r\nthe falling together of carbon and oxygen.  The atoms thus in close\r\nunion resemble our lead weight while resting on the earth; but we can\r\nwind up the weight and prepare it for another fall, and so these atoms\r\ncan be wound up and thus enabled to repeat the process of combination.\r\nIn the building of plants carbonic acid is the material from which the\r\ncarbon of the plant is derived; and the solar beam is the agent which\r\ntears the atoms asunder, setting the oxygen free, and allowing the\r\ncarbon to aggregate in woody fibre.  Let the solar rays fall upon a\r\nsurface of sand; the sand is heated, and finally radiates away as much\r\nheat as it receives; let the same beams fall upon a forest, the\r\nquantity of heat given back is less than the forest receives; for the\r\nenergy of a portion of the sunbeams is invested in building the trees.\r\nWithout the sun the reduction of the carbonic acid cannot be effected,\r\nand an amount of sunlight is consumed exactly equivalent to the\r\nmolecular work done.  Thus trees are formed; thus the cotton on which\r\nMr. Bazley discoursed last Friday is produced.  I ignite this cotton,\r\nand it flames; the oxygen again unites with the carbon; but an amount\r\nof heat equal to that produced by its combustion was sacrificed by the\r\nsun to form that bit of cotton.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, however, stop at vegetable life, for it is the source,\r\nmediate or immediate, of all animal life.  The sun severs the carbon\r\nfrom its oxygen and builds the vegetable; the animal consumes the\r\nvegetable thus formed, a reunion of the severed elements takes place,\r\nproducing animal heat.  The process of building a vegetable is one of\r\nwinding up; the process of building an animal is one of running down.\r\nThe warmth of our bodies, and every mechanical energy which we exert,\r\ntrace their lineage directly to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe fight of a pair of pugilists, the motion of an army, or the\r\nlifting of his own body by an Alpine climber up a mountain slope, are\r\nall cases of mechanical energy drawn from the sun.  A man weighing 150\r\npounds has 64 pounds of muscle; but these, when dried, reduce\r\nthemselves to 15 pounds.  Doing an ordinary day's work, for eighty\r\ndays, this mass of muscle would be wholly oxidised.  Special organs\r\nwhich do more work would be more quickly consumed: the heart, for\r\nexample, if entirely unsustained, would be oxidised in about a week.\r\nTake the amount of heat due to the direct oxidation of a given weight\r\nof food; less heat is developed by the oxidation of the same amount of\r\nfood in the working animal frame, and the missing quantity is the\r\nequivalent of the mechanical work accomplished by the muscles.\r\n\r\nI might extend these considerations; the work, indeed, is done to my\r\nhand--but I am warned that you have been already kept too long.  To\r\nwhom then are we indebted for the most striking generalisations of\r\nthis evening's discourse?  They are the work of a man of whom you have\r\nscarcely ever heard--the published labours of a German doctor, named\r\nMayer.  Without external stimulus, and pursuing his profession as town\r\nphysician in Heilbronn, this man was the first to raise the conception\r\nof the interaction of heat and other natural forces to clearness in\r\nhis own mind.  And yet he is scarcely ever heard of, and even to\r\nscientific men his merits are but partially known.  Led by his own\r\nbeautiful researches, and quite independent of Mayer, Mr. Joule\r\npublished in 1843 his first paper on the 'Mechanical Value of Heat;'\r\nbut in 1842 Mayer had actually calculated the mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat from data which only a man of the rarest penetration could turn\r\nto account.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 he published his memoir on 'Organic Motion,' and applied the\r\nmechanical theory of heat in the most fearless and precise manner to\r\nvital processes.  He also embraced the other natural agents in his\r\nchain of conservation.  In 1853 Mr. Waterston proposed, independently,\r\nthe meteoric theory of the sun's heat, and in 1854 Professor William\r\nThomson applied his admirable mathematical powers to the development\r\nof the theory; but six years previously the subject had been handled\r\nin a masterly manner by Mayer, and all that I have said about it has\r\nbeen derived from him.  When we consider the circumstances of Mayer's\r\nlife, and the period at which he wrote, we cannot fail to be struck\r\nwith astonishment at what he has accomplished.  Here was a man of\r\ngenius working in silence, animated solely by a love of his subject,\r\nand arriving at the most important results in advance of those whose\r\nlives were entirely devoted to Natural Philosophy.  It was the\r\naccident of bleeding a feverish patient at Java in 1840 that led Mayer\r\nto speculate on these subjects.  He noticed that the venous blood in\r\nthe tropics was of a brighter red than in colder latitudes, and his\r\nreasoning on this fact led him into the laboratory of natural forces,\r\nwhere he has worked with such signal ability and success.  Well, you\r\nwill desire to know what has become of this man.  His mind, it is\r\nalleged, gave way; it is said he became insane, and he was certainly\r\nsent to a lunatic asylum.  In a biographical dictionary of his country\r\nit is stated that he died there, but this is incorrect.  He recovered;\r\nand, I believe, is at this moment a cultivator of vineyards in\r\nHeilbronn.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\nJune 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nWhile preparing for publication my last course of lectures on Heat, I\r\nwished to make myself acquainted with all that Dr. Mayer had done in\r\nconnection with this subject.  I accordingly wrote to two gentlemen\r\nwho above all others seemed likely to give me the information which I\r\nneeded. [Footnote: Helmholtz and Clausius.]  Both of them are Germans,\r\nand both particularly distinguished in connection with the Dynamical\r\nTheory of Heat.  Each of them kindly furnished me with the list of\r\nMayer's publications, and one of them [Clausius] was so friendly as to\r\norder them from a bookseller, and to send them to me.  This friend, in\r\nhis reply to my first letter regarding Mayer, stated his belief that I\r\nshould not find anything very important in Mayer's writings; but\r\nbefore forwarding the memoirs to me he read them himself.  His letter\r\naccompanying them contains the following words: 'I must here retract\r\nthe statement in my last letter, that you would not find much matter\r\nof importance in Mayer's writings: I am astonished at the multitude of\r\nbeautiful and correct thoughts which they contain;' and he goes on to\r\npoint out various important subjects, in the treatment of which Mayer\r\nhad anticipated other eminent writers.  My other friend, in whose own\r\npublications the name of Mayer repeatedly occurs, and whose papers\r\ncontaining these references were translated some years ago by myself,\r\nwas, on the 10th of last month, unacquainted with the thoughtful and\r\nbeautiful essay of Mayer's, entitled 'Beitraege zur Dynamik des\r\nHimmels,' and in 1854, when Professor William Thomson developed in so\r\nstriking a manner the meteoric theory of the sun's heat, he was\r\ncertainly not aware of the existence of that essay, though from a\r\nrecent article in 'Macmillan's Magazine' I infer that he is now aware\r\nof it.  Mayer's physiological writings have been referred to by\r\nphysiologists--by Dr. Carpenter, for example--in terms of honouring\r\nrecognition.  We have hitherto, indeed, obtained fragmentary glimpses\r\nof the man, partly from physicists and partly from physiologists; but\r\nhis total merit has never yet been recognised as it assuredly would\r\nhave been had he chosen a happier mode of publication.  I do not think\r\na greater disservice could be done to a man of science, than to\r\noverstate his claims: such overstatement is sure to recoil to the\r\ndisadvantage of him in whose interest it is made.  But when Mayer's\r\nopportunities, achievements, and fate are taken into account, I do not\r\nthink that I shall be deeply blamed for attempting to place him in\r\nthat honourable position, which I believe to be his due.\r\n\r\nHere, however, are the titles of Mayer's papers, the perusal of which\r\nwill correct any error of judgment into which I may have fallen\r\nregarding their author.  'Bemerkungen ueber die Kraefte der unbelebten\r\nNatur,' Liebig's 'Annalen,' 1842, Vol. 42, p. 231; 'Die Organische\r\nBewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem Stoffwechsel,' Heilbronn,\r\n1845; 'Beitraege zur Dynamik des Himmels,' Heilbronn, 1848;\r\n'Bemerkungen ueber das Mechanische Equivalent der Waerme,' Heilbronn,\r\n1851.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM.--Dr. Julius Robert Mayer died at Heilbronn on March 20,\r\n1878, aged 63 years.  It gives me pleasure to reflect that the great\r\npositionwhich he will for ever occupy in the annals of science was\r\nfirst virtually assigned to him in the foregoing discourse.  He was\r\nsubsequently hosen by acclamation a member of the French Academy of\r\nSciences; and he received from the Royal Society the Copley medal-its\r\nHighest reward. [Footnote: See 'The Copley Medalist for 1871,' p.479.]\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\nNovember 1878.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the British Association at Glasgow in 1876--that is\r\nto say, more than fourteen years after its delivery and\r\npublication--the foregoing lecture was made the cloak for an unseemly\r\npersonal attack by Professor Tait.  The anger which found this\r\nuncourteous vent dates from 1863, when it fell to my lot to maintain,\r\nin opposition to him and a more eminent colleague, the position which\r\nin 1862 I had assigned to Dr. Mayer. [Footnote: See 'Philosophical\r\nMagazine' for this and the succeeding years.]  In those days Professor\r\nTait denied to Mayer all originality, and he has since, I regret to say,\r\nnever missed an opportunity, however small, of carping at Mayer's\r\nclaims.  The action of the Academy of Sciences and of the Royal Society\r\nsummarily disposes of this detraction, to which its object, during his\r\nlifetime, never vouchsafed either remonstrance or reply.\r\n\r\nSome time ago Professor Tait published a volume of lectures entitled\r\n'Recent Advances in Physical Science,' which I have reason to know has\r\nevoked an amount of censure far beyond that hitherto publicly\r\nexpressed.  Many of the best heads on the continent of Europe agree in\r\ntheir rejection and condemnation of the historic portions of this\r\nbook.  In March last it was subjected to a brief but pungent critique\r\nby Du Bois-Reymond, the celebrated Perpetual Secretary of the Academy\r\nof Sciences in Berlin.  Du Bois-Reymond's address was on 'National\r\nFeeling,' and his critique is thus wound up: 'The author of the\r\n\"Lectures\" is not, perhaps, sufficiently well acquainted with the\r\nhistory on which he professes to throw light, and on the later phases\r\nof which he passes so unreserved (schroff) a judgment.  He thus\r\nexposes himself to the suspicion--which, unhappily, is not weakened by\r\nhis other writings--that the fiery Celtic blood of his country\r\noccasionally runs away with him, converting him for the time into a\r\nscientific Chauvin.  Scientific Chauvinism,' adds the learned\r\nsecretary, 'from which German investigators have hitherto kept free,\r\nis more reprehensible (gehaessig) than political Chauvinism, inasmuch\r\nas self-control (_sittliche Haltung_) is more to be expected from men of\r\nscience, than from the politically excited mass.' [Footnote: Festrede,\r\ndelivered before the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, in celebration of\r\nthe birthday of the Emperor and King, March 28, 1878.]\r\n\r\nIn the case before this 'expectation' would, I fear, be doomed to\r\ndisappointment.  But Du Bois-Reymond and his countrymen must not\r\naccept the writings of Professor Tait as representative of the thought\r\nof England.  Surely no nation in the world has more effectually shaken\r\nitself free from scientific Chauvinism.  From the day that Davy, on\r\npresenting the Copley medal to Arago, scornfully brushed aside that\r\nspurious patriotism which would run national boundaries through the\r\nfree domain of science, chivalry towards foreigners has been a guiding\r\nprinciple with the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nOn the more private amenities indulged in by Professor Tait, I do not\r\nconsider it necessary to say a word.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXVII.  CONTRIBUTIONS TO MOLECULAR PHYSICS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A discourse delivered at the Royal Institution, March 18,\r\n1864--supplementing, though of prior date, the Rede Lecture on\r\nRadiation.]\r\n\r\nHAVING on previous occasions dwelt upon the enormous differences which\r\nexist among gaseous bodies both as regards their power of absorbing\r\nand emitting radiant heat, I have now to consider the effect of a\r\nchange of aggregation.  When a gas is condensed to a liquid, or a\r\nliquid congealed to a solid, the molecules coalesce, and grapple with\r\neach other by forces which are insensible as long as the gaseous state\r\nis maintained.  But, even in the solid and liquid conditions, the\r\nluminiferous aether still surrounds the molecules: hence, if the acts\r\nof radiation and absorption depend on them individually, regardless of\r\ntheir state of aggregation, the change from the gaseous to the liquid\r\nstate ought not materially to affect the radiant and absorbent power.\r\nIf, on the contrary, the mutual entanglement of the molecular by the\r\nforce of cohesion be of paramount influence, then we may expect that\r\nliquids will exhibit a deportment towards radiant heat altogether\r\ndifferent from that of the vapours from which they are derived.\r\n\r\nThe first part of an enquiry conducted in 1863-64 was devoted to an\r\nexhaustive examination of this question.  Twelve different liquids\r\nwere employed, and five different layers of each, varying in thickness\r\nfrom 0.02 of an inch to 0.27 of an inch.  The liquids were enclosed,\r\nnot in glass vessels, which would have materially modified the\r\nincident heat, but between plates of transparent rock-salt, which only\r\nslightly affected the radiation.  The source of heat throughout these\r\ncomparative experiments consisted of a platinum wire, raised to\r\nincandescence by an electric current of unvarying strength.  The\r\nquantities of radiant heat absorbed and transmitted by each of the\r\nliquids at the respective thicknesses were first determined.  The\r\nvapours of these liquids were subsequently examined, the quantities of\r\nvapour employed being rendered proportional to the quantities of\r\nliquid previously traversed by the radiant heat.  The result was that,\r\nfor heat from the same source, the order of absorption of liquids and\r\nof their vapours proved absolutely the same.  There is no known\r\nexception to this law; so that, to determine the position of a vapour\r\nas an absorber or a radiator, it is only necessary to determine the\r\nposition of its liquid.\r\n\r\nThis result proves that the state of aggregation, as far at all events\r\nas the liquid stage is concerned, is of altogether subordinate\r\nmoment--a conclusion which will probably prove to be of cardinal\r\nimportance in molecular physics.  On one important and contested point\r\nit has a special bearing.  If the position of a liquid as an absorber\r\nand radiator determine that of its vapour, the position of water fixes\r\nthat of aqueous vapour.  Water has been compared with other liquids in\r\na multitude of experiments, and it has been found, both as a radiant\r\nand as an absorbent, to transcend them all.  Thus, for example, a\r\nlayer of bisulphide of carbon 0.02 of an inch in thickness absorbs 6\r\nper cent, and allows 94 per cent of the radiation from the red-hot\r\nplatinum spiral to pass through it; benzol absorbs 43 and transmits 57\r\nper cent.  of the same radiation; alcohol absorbs 67 and transmits 33\r\nper cent, and alcohol, as an absorber of radiant heat, stands at the\r\nhead of all liquids except one.  The exception is water.  A layer of\r\nthis substance, of the thickness above given, absorbs 81 per cent, and\r\npermits only 19 per cent.  of the radiation to pass through it. Had no\r\nsingle experiment ever been made upon the vapour of water, its\r\nvigorous action upon radiant heat might be inferred from the\r\ndeportment of the liquid.\r\n\r\nThe relation of absorption and radiation to the chemical constitution\r\nof the radiating and absorbing substances was next briefly considered.\r\nFor the first six substances in the list of liquids examined, the\r\nradiant and absorbent powers augment as the number of atoms in the\r\ncompound molecule augments.  Thus, bisulphide of carbon has 3 atoms,\r\nchloroform 5, iodide of ethyl 8, benzol 12, and amylene 15 atoms in\r\ntheir respective molecules.  The order of their power as radiants and\r\nabsorbents is that here indicated, bisulphide of carbon being the\r\nfeeblest, and amylene the strongest of the six.  Alcohol, however,\r\nexcels benzol as an absorber, though it has but 9 atoms in its\r\nmolecule; but, on the other hand, its molecule is rendered more\r\ncomplex by the introduction of a new element.  Benzol contains carbon\r\nand hydrogen, while alcohol contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.\r\nThus, not only does atomic _multitude_ come into play in absorption and\r\nradiation--atomic _complexity_ must also be taken into account.  I would\r\nrecommend to the particular attention of chemists the molecule of\r\nwater; the deportment of this substance towards radiant heat being\r\nperfectly anomalous, if the chemical formula at present ascribed to it\r\nbe correct.\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel made the important discovery that, beyond the\r\nlimits of the red end of the solar spectrum, rays of high heating\r\npower exist which are incompetent to excite vision.  The discovery is\r\ncapable of extension.  Dissolving iodine in the bisulphide of carbon,\r\na solution is obtained which entirely intercepts the light of the most\r\nbrilliant flames, while to the ultra-red rays of such flames the same\r\niodine is found to be perfectly diathermic.  The transparent\r\nbisulphide, which is highly pervious to invisible heat, exercises on\r\nit the same absorption as the perfectly opaque solution.  A hollow\r\nprism filled with the opaque liquid being placed in the path of the\r\nbeam from an electric lamp, the light-spectrum is completely\r\nintercepted, but the heat spectrum may be received upon a screen and\r\nthere examined.  Falling upon a thermo-electric pile, its invisible\r\npresence is shown by the prompt deflection of even a coarse\r\ngalvanometer.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the physical meaning of opacity and transparency as\r\nregards light and radiant heat?  The visible rays of the spectrum\r\ndiffer from the invisible ones simply in period.  The sensation of\r\nlight is excited by waves of aether shorter and more quickly recurrent\r\nthan the non-visual waves which fall beyond 'the extreme red.  But why\r\nshould iodine stop the former and allow the latter to pass?  The\r\nanswer to this question no doubt is, that the intercepted waves are\r\nthose whose periods of recurrence coincide with the periods of\r\noscillation possible to the atoms of the dissolved iodine.  The\r\nelastic forces which keep these atoms apart compel them to vibrate in\r\ndefinite periods, and, when these periods synchronise with those of\r\nthe aethereal waves, the latter are absorbed.  Briefly defined, then,\r\ntransparency in liquids, as well as in gases, is synonymous with\r\ndiscord, while opacity is synonymous with accord, between the periods\r\nof the waves of aether and those of the molecules on which they\r\nimpinge.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view transparent and colourless substances owe their\r\ntransparency to the dissonance existing between the oscillating\r\nperiods of their atoms and those of the waves of the whole visible\r\nspectrum.  From the prevalence of transparency in compound bodies, the\r\ngeneral discord of the vibrating periods of their atoms with the\r\nlight-giving waves of the spectrum, may be inferred; while their\r\nsynchronism with the ultra-red periods is to be inferred from their\r\nopacity to the ultra-red rays.  Water illustrates this in a most\r\nstriking manner.  It is highly transparent to the luminous rays, which\r\nproves that its atoms do not readily oscillate in the periods which\r\nexcite vision.  It is highly opaque to the ultra-red undulations,\r\nwhich proves the synchronism of its vibrating periods with those of\r\nthe longer waves.\r\n\r\nIf, then, to the radiation from any source water shows itself\r\neminently or perfectly opaque, we may infer that the atoms whence the\r\nradiation emanates oscillate in ultra-red periods.  Let us apply this\r\ntest to the radiation from a flame of hydrogen.  This flame consists\r\nmainly of incandescent aqueous vapour, the temperature of which, as\r\ncalculated by Bunsen, is 3259°C, so that, if the penetrative power of\r\nradiant heat, as generally supposed, augment with the temperature of\r\nits source, we may expect the radiation from this flame to be\r\ncopiously transmitted by water.  While, however, a layer of the\r\nbisulphide of carbon 0.07 of an inch in thickness transmits 72 per\r\ncent.  of the incident radiation, and while every other liquid\r\nexamined transmits more or less of the heat, a layer of water of the\r\nabove thickness is entirely opaque to the radiation from the hydrogen\r\nflame.  Thus we establish accord between the periods of the atoms of\r\ncold water and those of aqueous vapour at a temperature of 3259°C. But\r\nthe periods of water have already been proved to be ultra red--hence\r\nthose of the hydrogen flame must be sensibly ultra-red also. The\r\nabsorption by dry air of the heat emitted by a platinum spiral raised\r\nto incandescence by electricity is insensible, while that by the\r\nordinary undried air is 6 per cent.  Substituting for the platinum\r\nspiral a hydrogen flame, the absorption by dry air still remains\r\ninsensible, while that of the undried air rises to 20 per cent.  of\r\nthe entire radiation.  The temperature of the hydrogen flame is, as\r\nstated, 3259°C; that of the aqueous vapour of the air 20°C.  Suppose,\r\nthen, the temperature of aqueous vapour to rise from 20°C.  to 3259°C,\r\nwe must conclude that the augmentation of temperature is applied to an\r\nincrease of amplitude or width of swing, and not to the introduction\r\nof quicker periods into the radiation.\r\n\r\nThe part played by aqueous vapour in the economy of nature is far more\r\nwonderful than has been hitherto supposed.  To nourish the vegetation\r\nof the earth the actinic and luminous rays of the sun must penetrate\r\nour atmosphere; and to such rays aqueous vapour is eminently\r\ntransparent.  The violet and the ultra-violet rays pass through it\r\nwith freedom.  To protect vegetation from destructive chills the\r\nterrestrial rays must be checked in their transit towards stellar\r\nspace; and this is accomplished by the aqueous vapour diffused through\r\nthe air.  This substance is the great moderator of the earth's\r\ntemperature, bringing its extremes into proximity, and obviating\r\ncontrasts between day and night which would render life insupportable.\r\nBut we can advance beyond this general statement, now that we know the\r\nradiation from aqueous vapour is intercepted, in a special degree, by\r\nwater, and, reciprocally, the radiation from water by aqueous vapour;\r\nfor it follows from this that the very act of nocturnal refrigeration\r\nwhich produces the condensation of aqueous vapour at the surface of\r\nthe earth--giving, as it were, a varnish of water to that\r\nsurface--imparts to terrestrial radiation that particular character\r\nwhich disqualifies it from passing through the earth's atmosphere and\r\nlosing itself in space.\r\n\r\nAnd here we come to a question in molecular physics which at the\r\npresent moment occupies attention.  By allowing the violet and\r\nultra-violet rays of the spectrum to fall upon sulphate of quinine and\r\nother substances Professor Stokes has changed the periods of those\r\nrays.  Attempts have been made to produce a similar result at the\r\nother end of the spectrum--to convert the ultra-red periods into\r\nperiods competent to excite vision--but hitherto without success. Such\r\na change of period, I agree with Dr. Miller in believing, occurs when\r\nthe limelight is produced by an oxy-hydrogen flame.  In this common\r\nexperiment there is an actual breaking up of long periods into short\r\nones--a true rendering of unvisual periods visual.  The change of\r\nrefrangibility here effected differs from that of Professor Stokes;\r\nfirstly, by its being in the opposite direction--that is, from a lower\r\nrefrangibility to a higher; and, secondly, in the circumstance that\r\nthe lime is heated by the collision of the molecules of aqueous\r\nvapour, before their heat has assumed the radiant form.  But it cannot\r\nbe doubted that the same effect would be produced by radiant heat of\r\nthe same periods, provided the motion of the aether could be rendered\r\nsufficiently intense. [Footnote: This was soon afterwards\r\naccomplished.  See the section on 'Transmutation of Rays'.]  The\r\neffect in principle is the same, whether we consider the lime to be\r\nstruck by a particle of aqueous vapour oscillating at a certain rate,\r\nor by a particle of aether oscillating at the same rate.\r\n\r\nBy plunging a platinum wire into a hydrogen flame we cause it to glow,\r\nand thus introduce shorter periods into the radiation.  These, as\r\nalready stated, are in discord with the atomic vibrations of water;\r\nhence we may infer that the transmission through water will be\r\nrendered more copious by the introduction of the wire into the flame.\r\nExperiment proves this conclusion to be true.  Water, from being\r\nopaque, opens a passage to 6 per cent.  of the radiation from the\r\nspiral.  A thin plate of colourless glass, moreover, transmits 68 per\r\ncent.  of the radiation from the hydrogen flame; but when the flame\r\nand spiral are employed, 78 per cent.  of the heat is transmitted.\r\n\r\nFor an alcohol flame Knoblauch and Melloni found glass to be less\r\ntransparent than for the same flame with a platinum spiral immersed in\r\nit; but Melloni afterwards showed that the result was not\r\ngeneral--that black glass and black mica were decidedly more\r\ndiathermic to the radiation from the pure alcohol flame. Melloni did\r\nnot explain this, but the reason is now obvious. The mica and glass\r\nowe their blackness to the carbon diffused through them.  This carbon,\r\nas first proved by Melloni, is in some measure transparent to the\r\nultra-red rays, and I have myself succeeded in transmitting between 40\r\nand 50 per cent. of the radiation from a hydrogen flame through a\r\nlayer of carbon which intercepted the light of an intensely brilliant\r\nflame.  The products of combustion of alcohol are carbonic acid and\r\naqueous vapour, the heat of which is almost wholly ultra-red.  For\r\nthis radiation, then, the carbon is in a considerable degree\r\ntransparent, while for the radiation from the platinum spiral, it is\r\nin a great measure opaque. The platinum wire, therefore, which\r\naugmented the radiation through the pure glass, augmented the\r\nabsorption of the black glass and mica.\r\n\r\nNo more striking or instructive illustration of the influence of\r\ncoincidence could be adduced than that furnished by the radiation from\r\na carbonic oxide flame. Here the product of combustion is carbonic\r\nacid; and on the radiation from this flame even the ordinary carbonic\r\nacid of the atmosphere exerts a powerful effect. A quantity of the\r\ngas, only one-thirtieth of an atmosphere in density, contained in a\r\npolished brass tube four feet long, intercepts 50 per cent. of the\r\nradiation from the carbonic oxide flame. For the heat emitted by\r\nlampblack, olefiant gas is a far more powerful absorber than carbonic\r\nacid; in fact, for such heat, with one exception, carbonic acid is the\r\nmost feeble absorber to be found among the compound gases. Moreover,\r\nfor the radiation from a hydrogen flame olefiant gas possesses twice\r\nthe absorbent power of carbonic acid, while for the radiation from the\r\ncarbonic oxide flame, at a common pressure of one inch of mercury, the\r\nabsorption by carbonic acid is more than twice that of olefiant gas.\r\nThus we establish the coincidence of period between carbonic acid at a\r\ntemperature of 20°C. and carbonic acid at a temperature of over\r\n3000°C, the periods of oscillation of both the incandescent and the\r\ncold gas belonging to the ultra-red portion of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing remarks and experiments how\r\nimpossible it is to determine the effect of temperature pure and\r\nsimple on the transmission of radiant heat if different sources of\r\nheat be employed. Throughout such an examination the same oscillating\r\natoms ought to be retained. This is done by beating a platinum spiral\r\nby an electric current, the temperature meanwhile varying between the\r\nwidest possible limits. Their comparative opacity to the ultra-red\r\nrays shows the general accord of the oscillating periods of the\r\nvapours referred to at the commencement of this lecture with those of\r\nthe ultra-red undulations. Hence, by gradually heating a platinum wire\r\nfrom darkness up to whiteness, we ought gradually to augment the\r\ndiscord between it and these vapours, and thus augment the\r\ntransmission. Experiment entirely confirms this conclusion. Formic\r\nnether, for example, absorbs 45 per cent. of the radiation from a\r\nplatinum spiral heated to barely visible redness; 32 per cent. of the\r\nradiation from the same spiral at a red heat; 26 per cent. of the\r\nradiation from a white-hot spiral, and only 21 per cent. when the\r\nspiral is brought near its point of fusion. Remarkable cases of\r\ninversion as to transparency also occur. For barely visible redness\r\nformic aether is more opaque than sulphuric; for a bright red heat\r\nboth are equally transparent; while, for a white heat, and still more\r\nfor a higher temperature, sulphuric aether is more opaque than formic.\r\nThis result gives us a clear view of the relationship of the two\r\nsubstances to the luminiferous aether. As we introduce waves of\r\nshorter period the sulphuric aether augments most rapidly in opacity;\r\nthat is to say, its accord with the shorter waves is greater than that\r\nof the formic. Hence we may infer that the atoms of formic aether\r\noscillate, on the whole, more slowly than those of sulphuric aether.\r\n\r\nWhen the source of heat is a Leslie's cube coated with lampblack and\r\nfilled with boiling water, the opacity of formic aether in comparison\r\nwith sulphuric is very decided. With this source also the positions of\r\nchloroform and iodide of methyl are inverted. For a white-hot spiral,\r\nthe absorption of chloroform vapour being 10 per cent, that of iodide\r\nof methyl is 16; with the blackened cube as source, the absorption by\r\nchloroform is 22 per cent, while that by the iodide of methyl is only\r\n19.  This inversion is not the result of temperature merely; for when\r\na platinum wire, heated to the temperature of boiling water, is\r\nemployed as a source, the iodide continues to be the most powerful\r\nabsorber.  All the experiments hitherto made go to prove that from\r\nheated lampblack an emission takes place which synchronises in an\r\nespecial manner with chloroform.  For the cube at 100' C, coated with\r\nlampblack, the absorption by chloroform is more than three times that\r\nby bisulphide of carbon; for the radiation from the most luminous\r\nportion of a gas-flame the absorption by chloroform is also\r\nconsiderably in excess of that by bisulphide of carbon; while, for the\r\nflame of a Bunsen's burner, from which the incandescent carbon\r\nparticles are removed by the free admixture of air, the absorption by\r\nbisulphide of carbon is nearly twice that by chloroform.  _The removal\r\nof the carbon particles more than doubles the relative transparency of\r\nthe chloroform_.  Testing, moreover, the radiation from various parts\r\nof the same flame, it was found that for the blue base of the flame\r\nthe bisulphide of carbon was most opaque, while for all other parts of\r\nthe flame the chloroform was most opaque.  For the radiation from a\r\nvery small gas flame, consisting of a blue base and a small white tip,\r\nthe bisulphide was also most opaque, and its opacity very decidedly\r\nexceeded that of the chloroform when the source of heat was the flame\r\nof bisulphide of carbon.  Comparing the radiation from a Leslie's cube\r\ncoated with isinglass with that from a similar cube coated with\r\nlampblack, at the common temperature of 100°C, it was found that, out\r\nof eleven vapours, all but one absorbed the radiation from the\r\nisinglass most powerfully; the single exception was chloroform.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that whenever, through a change of source, the\r\nposition of a vapour as an absorber of radiant heat was altered, the\r\nposition of the liquid from which the vapour was derived underwent a\r\nsimilar change.\r\n\r\nIt is still a point of difference between eminent investigators\r\nwhether radiant heat, up to a temperature of 100°C, is monochromatic\r\nor not.  Some affirm this; some deny it.  A long series of experiments\r\nenables me to state that probably no two substances at a temperature\r\nof 100°C.  emit heat of the same quality.  The heat emitted by\r\nisinglass, for example, is different from that emitted by lampblack,\r\nand the heat emitted by cloth, or paper, differs from both.  It is\r\nalso a subject of discussion whether rock-salt is equally diathermic\r\nto all kinds of calorific rays; the differences affirmed to exist by\r\nsome investigators being ascribed by others to differences of\r\nincidence from the various sources employed.  MM. de la Provostaye\r\nand Desains maintain the former view, Melloni and M. Knoblauch\r\nmaintain the latter.  I tested this point without changing anything\r\nbut the temperature of the source; its size, distance, and\r\nsurroundings remaining the same.  The experiments proved rock-salt to\r\nbe coloured thermally.  It is more opaque, for example, to the\r\nradiation from a barely visible spiral than to that from a white-hot\r\none.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the relation of radiation to conduction, if we define\r\nradiation, internal as well as external, as the communication of\r\nmotion from the vibrating atoms to the aether, we may, I think, by\r\nfair theoretic reasoning, reach the conclusion that the best radiators\r\nought to prove the worst conductors.  A broad consideration of the\r\nsubject shows at once the general harmony of this conclusion with\r\nobserved facts.  Organic substances are all excellent radiators; they\r\nare also extremely bad conductors.  The moment we pass from the metals\r\nto their compounds we pass from good conductors to bad ones, and from\r\nbad radiators to good ones.  Water, among liquids, is probably the\r\nworst conductor; it is the best radiator.  Silver, among solids, is\r\nthe best conductor; it is the worst radiator.  The excellent\r\nresearches of MM. de la Provostaye and Desains furnish a striking\r\nillustration of what I am inclined to regard as a natural law--that\r\nthose atoms which transfer the greatest amount of motion to the\r\naether, or, in other words, radiate most powerfully, are the least\r\ncompetent to communicate motion to each other, or, in other words, to\r\npropagate by conduction readily.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXVIII.  LIFE, AND LETTERS OF FARADAY.\r\n\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nUNDERTAKEN and executed in a reverent and loving spirit, the work of\r\nDr. Bence Jones makes Faraday the virtual writer of his own life.\r\nEverybody now knows the story of the philosopher's birth; that his\r\nfather was a smith; that he was born at Newington Butts in 1791; that\r\nhe ran along the London pavements, a bright-eyed errand boy, with a\r\nload of brown curls upon his head and a packet of newspapers under his\r\narm; that the lad's master was a bookseller and bookbinder--a kindly\r\nman, who became attached to the little fellow, and in due time made\r\nhim his apprentice without fee; that during his apprenticeship he\r\nfound his appetite for knowledge provoked and strengthened by the\r\nbooks he stitched and covered.  Thus he grew in wisdom and stature to\r\nhis year of legal manhood, when he appears in the volumes before us as\r\na writer of letters, which reveal his occupation, acquirements, and\r\ntone of mind.  His correspondent was Mr. Abbott, a member of the\r\nSociety of Friends, who, with a forecast of his correspondent's\r\ngreatness, preserved his letters and produced them at the proper time.\r\n\r\nIn later years Faraday always carried in his pocket a blank card, on\r\nwhich he jotted down in pencil his thoughts and memoranda.  He made\r\nhis notes in the laboratory, in the theatre, and in the streets.  This\r\ndistrust of his memory reveals itself in his first letter to Abbot. To\r\na proposition that no new enquiry should be started between them\r\nbefore the old one had been exhaustively discussed, Faraday objects.\r\n'Your notion,' he says, 'I can hardly allow, for the following\r\nreason: ideas and thoughts spring up in my mind which are irrevocably\r\nlost for want of noting at the time.' Gentle as he seemed, he wished\r\nto have his own way, and he had it throughout his life.  Differences\r\nof opinion sometimes arose between the two friends, and then they\r\nresolutely faced each other.  'I accept your offer to fight it out\r\nwith joy, and shall in the battle of experience cause not pain, but, I\r\nhope, pleasure.' Faraday notes his own impetuosity, and incessantly\r\nchecks it.  There is at times something almost mechanical in his\r\nself-restraint.  In another nature it would have hardened into mere\r\n'correctness' of conduct; but his overflowing affections prevented\r\nthis in his case.  The habit of self control became a second nature to\r\nhim at last, and lent serenity to his later years.\r\n\r\nIn October 1812 he was engaged by a Mr. De la Roche as a journeyman\r\nbookbinder; but the situation did not suit him.  His master appears to\r\nhave been an austere and passionate man, and Faraday was to the last\r\ndegree sensitive.  All his life he continued so.  He suffered at times\r\nfrom dejection; and a certain grimness, too, pervaded his moods.  'At\r\npresent,' he writes to Abbott, 'I am as serious as you can be, and\r\nwould not scruple to speak a truth to any human being, whatever\r\nrepugnance it might give rise to.  Being in this state of mind, I\r\nshould have refrained from writing to you, did I not conceive from the\r\ngeneral tenor of your letters that your mind is, at proper times,\r\noccupied upon serious subjects to the exclusion of those that are\r\nfrivolous.'  Plainly he had fallen into that stern Puritan mood, which\r\nnot only crucifies the affections and lusts of him who harbours it,\r\nbut is often a cause of disturbed digestion to his friends.\r\n\r\nAbout three months after his engagement with De la Roche, Faraday\r\nquitted him and bookbinding together.  He had heard Davy, copied his\r\nlectures, and written to him, entreating to be released from Trade,\r\nwhich he hated, and enabled to pursue Science.  Davy recognised the\r\nmerit of his correspondent, kept his eye upon him, and, when occasion\r\noffered, drove to his door and sent in a letter, offering him the post\r\nof assistant in the laboratory of the Royal Institution.  He was\r\nengaged March 1, 1813, and on the 8th we find him extracting the sugar\r\nfrom beet-root.  He joined the City Philosophical Society which had\r\nbeen founded by Mr. Tatum in 1808.  'The discipline was very sturdy,\r\nthe remarks very plain, and the results most valuable.' Faraday\r\nderived great profit from this little association.  In the laboratory\r\nhe had a discipline sturdier still.  Both Davy and himself were at\r\nthis time frequently cut and bruised by explosions of chloride of\r\nnitrogen.  One explosion was so rapid 'as to blow my hand open, tear\r\naway a part of one nail, and make my fingers so sore that I cannot use\r\nthem easily.' In another experiment 'the tube and receiver were blown\r\nto pieces, I got a cut on the head, and Sir Humphry a bruise on his\r\nhand.' And again speaking of the same substance, he says, 'when put in\r\nthe pump and exhausted, it stood for a moment, and then exploded with\r\na fearful noise.  Both Sir H.  and I had masks on, but I escaped this\r\ntime the best. Sir H. had his face cut in two places about the chin,\r\nand a violent blow on the forehead struck through a considerable\r\nthickness of silk and leather.' It was this same substance that blew\r\nout the eye of Dulong.\r\n\r\nOver and over again, even at this early date, we can discern the\r\nquality which, compounded with his rare intellectual power, made\r\nFaraday a great experimental philosopher.  This was his desire to see\r\nfacts, and not to rest contented with the descriptions of them.  He\r\nfrequently pits the eye against the ear, and affirms the enormous\r\nsuperiority of the organ of vision.  Late in life I have heard him say\r\nthat he could never fully understand an experiment until he had seen\r\nit.  But he did not confine himself to experiment.  He aspired to be a\r\nteacher, and reflected and wrote upon the method of scientific\r\nexposition.  'A lecturer,' he observes, 'should appear easy and\r\ncollected, undaunted and unconcerned:' still 'his whole behaviour\r\nshould evince respect for his audience.'  These recommendations were\r\nafterwards in great part embodied by himself.  I doubt his\r\n'unconcern,' but his fearlessness was often manifested.  It used to\r\nrise within him as a wave, which carried both him and his audience\r\nalong with it.  On rare occasions also, when he felt himself and his\r\nsubject hopelessly unintelligible, he suddenly evoked a certain\r\nrecklessness of thought, and, without halting to extricate his\r\nbewildered followers, he would dash alone through the jungle into\r\nwhich he had unwittingly led them; thus saving them from ennui by the\r\nexhibition of a vigour which, for the time being, they could neither\r\nshare nor comprehend.\r\n\r\nIn October 1813 he quitted England with Sir Humphry and Lady Davy.\r\nDuring his absence he kept a journal, from which copious and\r\ninteresting extracts have been made by Dr. Bence Jones.  Davy was\r\nconsiderate, preferring at times to be his own servant rather than\r\nimpose on Faraday duties which he disliked.  But Lady Davy was the\r\nreverse.  She treated him as an underling; he chafed under the\r\ntreatment, and was often on the point of returning home.  They halted\r\nat Geneva.  De la Rive, the elder, had known Davy in 1799, and, by his\r\nwritings in the 'Bibliothéque Britannique,' had been the first to make\r\nthe English chemist's labours known abroad.  He welcomed Davy to his\r\ncountry residence in 1814.  Both were sportsmen, and they often went\r\nout shooting together.  On these occasions Faraday charged Davy's gun\r\nwhile De la Rive charged his own.  Once the Genevese philosopher found\r\nhimself by the side of Faraday, and in his frank and genial way\r\nentered into conversation with the young man.  It was evident that a\r\nperson possessing such a charm of manner and such high intelligence\r\ncould be no mere servant.  On enquiry De la Rive was somewhat shocked\r\nto find that the _soi-disant domestique_ was really _préparateur_ in the\r\nlaboratory of the Royal Institution; and he immediately proposed that\r\nFaraday thenceforth should join the masters instead of the servants at\r\ntheir meals.  To this Davy, probably out of weak deference to his\r\nwife, objected; but an arrangement was come to that Faraday\r\nthenceforward should have his food in his own room.  Rumour states\r\nthat a dinner in honour of Faraday was given by De la Rive.  This is a\r\ndelusion; there was no such banquet; but Faraday never forgot the\r\nkindness of the friend who saw his merit when he was a mere _garcon de\r\nlaboratoire_. [Footnote: While confined last autumn at Geneva by the\r\neffects of a fall in the Alps, my friends, with a kindness I can never\r\nforget, did all that friendship could suggest to render my captivity\r\npleasant to me.  M. de la Rive then wrote out for me the full account,\r\nof which the foregoing is a condensed abstract.  It was at the desire\r\nof Dr. Bence Jones that I asked him to do so.  The rumour of a banquet\r\nat Geneva illustrates the tendency to substitute for the youth of 1814\r\nthe Faraday of later years.]\r\n\r\nHe returned in 1815 to the Royal Institution.  Here he helped Davy for\r\nyears; he worked also for himself, and lectured frequently at the City\r\nPhilosophical Society.  He took lessons in elocution, happily without\r\ndamage to his natural force, earnestness, and grace of delivery.  He\r\nwas never pledged to theory, and he changed in opinion as knowledge\r\nadvanced.  With him life was growth.  In those early lectures we hear\r\nhim say, 'In knowledge, that man only is to be contemned and despised\r\nwho is not in a state of transition.'  And again: 'Nothing is more\r\ndifficult and requires more caution than philosophical deduction, nor\r\nis there anything more adverse to its accuracy than fixity of\r\nopinion.' Not that he was wafted about by every wind of doctrine; but\r\nthat he united flexibility with his strength.  In striking contrast\r\nwith this intellectual expansiveness was his fixity in religion, but\r\nthis is a subject which cannot be discussed here.\r\n\r\nOf all the letters published in these volumes none possess a greater\r\ncharm than those of Faraday to his wife.  Here, as Dr. Bence Jones\r\ntruly remarks, 'he laid open all his mind and the whole of his\r\ncharacter, and what can be made known can scarcely fail to charm every\r\none by its loveliness, its truthfulness, and its earnestness.' Abbott\r\nand he sometimes swerved into wordplay about love; but up to 1820, or\r\nthereabouts, the passion was potential merely.  Faraday's journal\r\nindeed contains entries which show that he took pleasure in the\r\nassertion of his contempt for love; but these very entries became\r\nlinks in his destiny.  It was through them that he became acquainted\r\nwith one who inspired him with a feeling which only ended with his\r\nlife.  His biographer has given us the means of tracing the varying\r\nmoods which preceded his acceptance.  They reveal more than the common\r\nalternations of light and gloom; at one moment he wishes that his\r\nflesh might melt and that he might become nothing; at another he is\r\nintoxicated with hope.  The impetuosity of his character was then\r\nunchastened by the discipline to which it was subjected in after\r\nyears.  The very strength of his passion proved for a time a bar to\r\nits advance, suggesting, as it did, to the conscientious mind of Miss\r\nBarnard, doubts of her capability to return it with adequate force.\r\nBut they met again and again, and at each successive meeting he found\r\nhis heaven clearer, until at length he was able to say, 'Not a\r\nmoment's alloy of this evening's happiness occurred.  Everything was\r\ndelightful to the last moment of my stay with my companion, because\r\nshe was so.' The turbulence of doubt subsided, and a calm and\r\nelevating confidence took its place.  'What can I call myself,' he\r\nwrites to her in a subsequent letter, 'to convey most perfectly my\r\naffection and love for you?  Can I or can truth say more than that for\r\nthis world I am yours?  Assuredly he made his profession good, and no\r\nfairer light falls upon his character than that which reveals his\r\nrelations to his wife.  Never, I believe, existed a manlier, purer,\r\nsteadier love.  Like a burning diamond, it continued to shed, for\r\nsix-and-forty years, its white and smokeless glow.\r\n\r\nFaraday was married on June 12, 1821; and up to this date Davy appears\r\nthroughout as his friend.  Soon afterwards, however, disunion occurred\r\nbetween them, which, while it lasted, must have given Faraday intense\r\npain.  It is impossible to doubt the honesty of conviction with which\r\nthis subject has been treated by Dr. Bence Jones, and there may be\r\nfacts known to him, but not appearing in these volumes, which justify\r\nhis opinion that Davy in those days had become jealous of Faraday.\r\nThis, which is the prevalent belief, is also reproduced in an\r\nexcellent article in the March number of 'Framer's Magazine.' But the\r\nbest analysis I can make of the data fails to present Davy in this\r\nlight to me.  The facts, as I regard them, are briefly these.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, Oersted of Copenhagen made the celebrated discovery which\r\nconnects electricity with magnetism, and immediately afterwards the\r\nacute mind of Wollaston perceived that a wire carrying a current ought\r\nto rotate round its own axis under the influence of a magnetic pole.\r\nIn 1821 'he tried, but failed, to realise this result in the\r\nlaboratory of the Royal Institution.  Faraday was not present at the\r\nmoment, but he came in immediately afterwards and heard the\r\nconversation of Wollaston and Davy about the experiment.  He had also\r\nheard a rumour of a wager that Dr. Wollaston would eventually succeed.\r\n\r\nThis was in April.  In the autumn of the same year Faraday wrote a\r\nhistory of electro-magnetism, and repeated for himself the experiments\r\nwhich he described.  It was while thus instructing himself that he\r\nsucceeded in causing a wire, carrying an electric current, to rotate\r\nround a magnetic pole.  This was not the result sought by Wollaston,\r\nbut it was closely related to that result.\r\n\r\nThe strong tendency of Faraday's mind to look upon the reciprocal\r\nactions of natural forces gave birth to his greatest discoveries; and\r\nwe, who know this, should be justified in concluding that, even had\r\nWollaston not preceded him, the result would have been the same.  But\r\nin judging Davy we ought to transport ourselves to his time, and\r\ncarefully exclude from our thoughts and feelings that noble subsequent\r\nlife, which would render simply impossible the ascription to Faraday\r\nof anything unfair.  It would be unjust to Davy to put our knowledge\r\nin the place of his, or to credit him with data which he could not\r\nhave possessed.  Rumour and fact had connected the name of Wollaston\r\nwith these supposed interactions between magnets and currents.  When,\r\ntherefore, Faraday in October published his successful experiment,\r\nwithout any allusion to Wollaston, general, though really ungrounded,\r\ncriticism followed.  I say ungrounded because, firstly, Faraday's\r\nexperiment was not that of Wollaston, and secondly, Faraday, before he\r\npublished it, had actually called upon Wollaston, and not finding him\r\nat home, did not feel himself authorised to mention his name.\r\n\r\nIn December, Faraday published a second paper on the same subject,\r\nfrom which, through a misapprehension, the name of Wollaston was also\r\nomitted.  Warburton and others thereupon affirmed that Wollaston's\r\nideas had been appropriated without acknowledgment, and it is plain\r\nthat Wollaston himself, though cautious in his utterance, was also\r\nhurt.  Censure grew till it became intolerable.  'I hear,' writes\r\nFaraday to his friend Stodart, 'every day more and more of these\r\nsounds, which, though only whispers to me, are, I suspect, spoken\r\naloud among scientific men.' He might have written explanations and\r\ndefences, but he went straighter to the point.  He wished to see the\r\nprincipals face to face--to plead his cause before them personally.\r\nThere was a certain vehemence in his desire to do this.  He saw\r\nWollaston, he saw Davy, he saw Warburton; and I am inclined to think\r\nthat it was the irresistible candour and truth of character which\r\nthese viva voce defences revealed, as much as the defences themselves,\r\nthat disarmed resentment at the time.\r\n\r\nAs regards Davy, another cause of dissension arose in 1823.  In the\r\nspring of that year Faraday analysed the hydrate of chlorine, a\r\nsubstance once believed to be the element chlorine, but proved by Davy\r\nto be a compound of that element and water.  The analysis was looked\r\nover by Davy, who then and there suggested to Faraday to heat the\r\nhydrate in a closed glass tube.  This was done, the substance was\r\ndecomposed, and one of the products of decomposition was proved by\r\nFaraday to be chlorine liquefied by its own pressure.  On the day of\r\nits discovery he communicated this result to Dr. Paris.  Davy, on\r\nbeing informed of it, instantly liquefied another gas in the same way.\r\nHaving struck thus into Faraday's enquiry, ought he not to have left\r\nthe matter in Faraday's hands?  I think he ought.  But, considering\r\nhis relation to both Faraday and the hydrate of chlorine, Davy, I\r\nsubmit, may be excused for thinking differently.  A father is not\r\nalways wise enough to see that his son has ceased to be a boy, and\r\nestrangement on this account is not rare; nor was Davy wise enough to\r\ndiscern that Faraday had passed the mere assistant stage, and become a\r\ndiscoverer.  It is now hard to avoid magnifying this error.  But had\r\nFaraday died or ceased to work at this time, or had his subsequent\r\nlife been devoted to money-getting, instead of to research, would\r\nanybody now dream of ascribing jealousy to Davy?  Assuredly not.  Why\r\nshould he be jealous?  His reputation at this time was almost without\r\na parallel: his glory was without a cloud.  He had added to his other\r\ndiscoveries that of Faraday, and after having been his teacher for\r\nseven years, his language to him was this: 'It gives me great pleasure\r\nto hear that you are comfortable at the Royal Institution, and I trust\r\nthat you will not only do something good and honourable for yourself,\r\nbut also for science.' This is not the language of jealousy, potential\r\nor actual.  But the chlorine business introduced irritation and anger,\r\nto which, and not to any ignobler motive, Davy's opposition to the\r\nelection of Faraday to the Royal Society is, I am persuaded, to be\r\nascribed.\r\n\r\nThese matters are touched upon with perfect candour, and becoming\r\nconsideration, in the volumes of Dr. Bence Jones; but in 'society'\r\nthey are not always so handled.  Here a name of noble intellectual\r\nassociations is surrounded by injurious rumours which I would\r\nwillingly scatter for ever.  The pupil's magnitude, and the splendour\r\nof his position, are too great and absolute to need as a foil the\r\nhumiliation of his master.  Brothers in intellect, Davy and Faraday,\r\nhowever, could never have become brothers in feeling; their characters\r\nwere too unlike.  Davy loved the pomp and circumstance of fame;\r\nFaraday the inner consciousness that he had fairly won renown.  They\r\nwere both proud men.  But with Davy pride projected itself into the\r\nouter world; while with Faraday it became a steadying and dignifying\r\ninward force.  In one great particular they agreed.  Each of them\r\ncould have turned his science to immense commercial profit, but\r\nneither of them did so.  The noble excitement of research, and the\r\ndelight of discovery, constituted their reward.  I commend them to the\r\nreverence which great gifts greatly exercised ought to inspire.  They\r\nwere both ours; and through the coming centuries England will be able\r\nto point with just pride to the possession of such men.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the 'Life and Letters' reveals to us the youth who\r\nwas to be father to the man.  Skilful, aspiring, resolute, he grew\r\nsteadily in knowledge and in power.  Consciously or unconsciously, the\r\nrelation of Action to Reaction was ever present to Faraday's mind.  It\r\nhad been fostered by his discovery of Magnetic Rotations, and it\r\nplanted in him more daring ideas of a similar kind.  Magnetism he knew\r\ncould be evoked by electricity, and he thought that electricity, in\r\nits turn, ought to be capable of evolution by magnetism.  On August\r\n29, 1831, his experiments on this subject began.  He had been\r\nfortified by previous trials, which, though failures, had begotten\r\ninstincts directing him towards the truth.  He, like every strong\r\nworker, might at times miss the outward object, but he always gained\r\nthe inner light, education, and expansion.  Of this Faraday's life was\r\na constant illustration.  By November he had discovered and colligated\r\na multitude of the most wonderful and unexpected phenomena.  He had\r\ngenerated currents by currents; currents by magnets, permanent and\r\ntransitory; and he afterwards generated currents by the earth itself.\r\nArago's 'Magnetism of Rotation,' which had for years offered itself\r\nas a challenge to the best scientific intellects of Europe, now fell\r\ninto his hands.  It proved to be a beautiful, but still special,\r\nillustration of the great principle of Magneto-electric Induction.\r\nNothing equal to this latter, in the way of pure experimental enquiry,\r\nhad previously been achieved.\r\n\r\nElectricities from various sources were next examined, and their\r\ndifferences and resemblances revealed.  He thus assured himself of\r\ntheir substantial identity.  He then took up Conduction, and gave many\r\nstriking illustrations of the influence of Fusion on Conducting Power.\r\nRenouncing professional work, from which at this time he might have\r\nderived an income of many thousands a year, he poured his whole\r\nmomentum into his researches.  He was long entangled in\r\nElectrochemistry.  The light of law was for a time obscured by the\r\nthick umbrage of novel facts; but he finally emerged from his\r\nresearches with the great principle of Definite Electro-chemical\r\nDecomposition in his hands.  If his discovery of Magneto-electricity\r\nmay be ranked with that of the pile by Volta, this new discovery, may\r\nalmost stand beside that of Definite Combining Proportions in\r\nChemistry.  He passed on to Static Electricity--its Conduction,\r\nInduction, and Mode of Propagation.  He discovered and illustrated the\r\nprinciple of Inductive Capacity; and, turning to theory, he asked\r\nhimself how electrical attractions and repulsions are transmitted. Are\r\nthey, like gravity, actions at a distance, or do they require a\r\nmedium?  If the former, then, like gravity, they will act in straight\r\nlines; if the latter, then, like sound or light, they may turn a\r\ncorner.  Faraday held--and his views are gaining ground--that his\r\nexperiments proved the fact of curvilinear propagation, and hence the\r\noperation of a medium.  Others denied this; but none can deny the\r\nprofound and philosophic character of his leading thought. [Footnote:\r\nIn a very remarkable paper published in Poggendorff's 'Annalen' for\r\n1857, Werner Siemens accepts and develops Faraday's theory of\r\nMolecular Induction.]  The first volume of the Researches contains all\r\nthe papers here referred to.\r\n\r\nFaraday had heard it stated that henceforth physical discoveries would\r\nbe made solely by the aid of mathematics; that we had our data, and\r\nneeded only to work deductively.  Statements of a similar character\r\ncrop out from time to time in our day.  They arise from an imperfect\r\nacquaintance with the nature, present condition, and prospective\r\nvastness of the field of physical enquiry.  The tendency of natural\r\nscience doubtless is to bring all physical phenomena under the\r\ndominion of mechanical laws; to give them, in other words,\r\nmathematical expression.  But our approach to this result is\r\nasymptotic; and for ages to come--possibly for all the ages of the\r\nhuman race--Nature will find room for both the philosophical\r\nexperimenter and the mathematician.  Faraday entered his protest\r\nagainst the foregoing statement by labelling his investigations\r\n'Experimental Researches in Electricity.' They were completed in 1854,\r\nand three volumes of them have been published.  For the sake of\r\nreference, he numbered every paragraph, the last number being 3362. In\r\n1859 he collected and published a fourth volume of papers, under the\r\ntitle, 'Experimental Researches in Chemistry and Physics.' Thus did\r\nthis apostle of experiment illustrate its power, and magnify his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of the Researches embraces memoirs on the\r\nElectricity of the Gymnotus; on the Source of Power in the Voltaic\r\nPile; on the Electricity evolved by the Friction of Water and Steam,\r\nin which the phenomena and principles of Sir William Armstrong's\r\nHydro-electric machine are described and developed; a paper on\r\nMagnetic Rotations, and Faraday's letters in relation to the\r\ncontroversy it aroused.  The contribution of most permanent value\r\nhere, is that on the Source of Power in the Voltaic Pile.  By it the\r\nContact Theory, pure and simple, was totally overthrown, and the\r\nnecessity of chemical action to the maintenance of the current\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe third volume of the Researches opens with a memoir entitled 'The\r\nMagnetisation of Light,' and the Illumination of Magnetic Lines of\r\nForce.' It is difficult even now to affix a definite meaning to this\r\ntitle; but the discovery of the rotation of the plane of polarisation,\r\nwhich it announced, seems pregnant with great results.  The writings\r\nof William Thomson on the theoretic aspects of the discovery; the\r\nexcellent electrodynamic measurements of Wilhelm Weber, which are\r\nmodels of experimental completeness and skill; Weber's labours in\r\nconjunction with his lamented friend Kohlrausch--above all, the\r\nresearches of Clerk Maxwell on the Electro-magnetic Theory of\r\nLight--point to that wonderful and mysterious medium, which is the\r\nvehicle of light and radiant heat, as the probable basis also of\r\nmagnetic and electric phenomena.  The hope of such a connection was\r\nfirst raised by the discovery here referred to. [Footnote: A letter\r\naddressed to me by Professor Weber on March 18 last contains the\r\nfollowing reference to the connection here mentioned: 'Die Hoffnung\r\neiner solchen Combination ist durch Faraday's Entdeckung der\r\nDrehung er Polarisationsebene durch magnetische Directionskraft\r\nzuerst, und sodann durch die Uebereinstimmung derjenigen\r\nGeschwindigkeit, welche das Verhaeltniss der electro-dynamischen\r\nEinheit zur lectro-statischen ausdrueckt, mit der Geschwindigkeit\r\ndes Lichts angeregt worden; und mir scheint von allen Versuchen,\r\nwelche zur erwirklichung dieser Hoffnung gemacht worden sind, das von\r\nHerrn Maxwell gemachte am erfolgreichsten.'] Faraday himself seemed to\r\ncling with particular affection to this discovery.  He felt that there\r\nwas more in it than he was able to unfold.  He predicted that it would\r\ngrow in meaning with the growth of science.  This it has done; this it\r\nis doing now.  Its right interpretation will probably mark an epoch in\r\nscientific history.\r\n\r\nRapidly following it is the discovery of Diamagnetism, or the\r\nrepulsion of matter by a magnet.  Brugmans had shown that bismuth\r\nrepelled a magnetic needle.  Here he stopped.  Le Bailliff proved that\r\nantimony did the same.  Here he stopped.  Seebeck, Becquerel, and\r\nothers, also touched the discovery.  These fragmentary gleams excited\r\na momentary curiosity and were almost forgotten, when Faraday\r\nindependently alighted on the same facts; and, instead of stopping,\r\nmade them the inlets to a new and vast region of research.  The value\r\nof a discovery is to be measured by the intellectual action it calls\r\nforth; and it was Faraday's good fortune to strike such lodes of\r\nscientific truth as give occupation to some of the best intellects of\r\nour age.\r\n\r\nThe salient quality of Faraday's scientific character reveals itself\r\nfrom beginning to end of these volumes; a union of ardour and\r\npatience--the one prompting the attack, the other holding him on to\r\nit, till defeat was final or victory assured.  Certainty in one sense\r\nor the other was necessary to his peace of mind.  The right method of\r\ninvestigation is perhaps incommunicable; it depends on the individual\r\nrather than on the system, and the mark is missed when Faraday's\r\nresearches are pointed to as merely illustrative of the power of the\r\ninductive philosophy.  The brain may be filled with that philosophy;\r\nbut without the energy and insight which this man possessed, and which\r\nwith him were personal and distinctive, we should never rise to the\r\nlevel of his achievements.  His power is that of individual genius,\r\nrather than of philosophic method; the energy of a strong soul\r\nexpressing itself after its own fashion, and acknowledging no mediator\r\nbetween it and Nature.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of the 'Life and Letters,' like the first, is a\r\nhistoric treasury as regards Faraday's work and character, and his\r\nscientific and social relations.  It contains letters from Humboldt,\r\nHerschel, Hachette, De la Rive, Dumas, Liebig, Melloni, Becquerel,\r\nOersted, Plucker, Du Bois Reymond, Lord Melbourne, Prince Louis\r\nNapoleon, and many other distinguished men.  I notice with particular\r\npleasure a letter from Sir John Herschel, in reply to a sealed packet\r\naddressed to him by Faraday, but which he had permission to open if he\r\npleased.  The packet referred to one of the many unfulfilled hopes\r\nwhich spring up in the minds of fertile investigators:\r\n\r\n'Go on and prosper, \"from strength to strength,\" like a victor\r\nmarching with assured step to further conquests; and be certain that\r\nno voice will join more heartily in the peans that already begin to\r\nrise, and will speedily swell into a shout of triumph, astounding even\r\nto yourself, than that of J.  F.  W.  Herschel.'\r\n\r\nFaraday's behaviour to Melloni in 1835 merits a word of notice.  The\r\nyoung man was a political exile in Paris.  He had newly fashioned and\r\napplied the thermo-electric pile, and had obtained with it results of\r\nthe greatest importance.  But they were not appreciated.  With the\r\nsickness of disappointed hope Melloni waited for the report of the\r\nCommissioners, appointed by the Academy of Sciences to examine the\r\nPrimier.  At length he published his researches in the 'Annales de\r\nChimie.' They thus fell into the hands of Faraday, who, discerning at\r\nonce their extraordinary merit, obtained for their author the Rumford\r\nMedal of the Royal Society.  A sum of money always accompanies this\r\nmedal; and the pecuniary help was, at this time, even more essential\r\nthan the mark of honour to the young refugee.  Melloni's gratitude was\r\nboundless:\r\n\r\n'Et vous, monsieur,' he writes to Faraday, 'qui appartenez à une\r\nsociété à laquelle je n'avais rien offert, vous qui me connaissiez à\r\npeine de nom; vous n'avez pas demandé si j'avais des ennemis faibles\r\nou puissants, ni calculé quel en était le nombre; mais vous avez parlé\r\npour l'opprimé étranger, pour celui qui n'avait pas le moindre droit à\r\ntant de bienveillance, et vos paroles ont été accueillies\r\nfavorablement par des collègues consciencieux!  Je reconnais bien là\r\ndes hommes dignes de leur noble mission, les véritable représentants\r\nde la science d'un pays libre et généreux.'\r\n\r\nWithin the prescribed limits of this article it would be impossible to\r\ngive even the slenderest summary of Faraday's correspondence, or to\r\ncarve from it more than the merest fragments of his character.  His\r\nletters, written to Lord Melbourne and others in 1836, regarding his\r\npension, illustrate his uncompromising independence.  The Prime\r\nMinister had offended him, but assuredly the apology demanded and\r\ngiven was complete.  I think 'it certain that, notwithstanding the\r\nvery full account of this transaction given by Dr. Bence Jones,\r\nmotives and influences were at work which even now are not entirely\r\nrevealed.  The minister was bitterly attacked, but he bore the censure\r\nof the press with great dignity.  Faraday, while he disavowed having\r\neither directly or indirectly furnished the matter of those attacks,\r\ndid not publicly exonerate the Premier.  The Hon.  Caroline Fox had\r\nproved herself Faraday's ardent friend, and it was she who had healed\r\nthe breach between the philosopher and the minister.  She manifestly\r\nthought that Faraday ought to have come forward in Lord Melbourne's\r\ndefence, and there is a flavour of resentment in one of her letters to\r\nhim on the subject.  No doubt Faraday had good grounds for his\r\nreticence, but they are to me unknown.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 his health broke down utterly, and he went to Switzerland with\r\nhis wife and brother-in-law.  His bodily vigour soon revived, and he\r\naccomplished feats of walking respectable even for a trained\r\nmountaineer.  The published extracts from his Swiss journal contain\r\nmany beautiful and touching allusions.  Amid references to the tints\r\nof the Jungfrau, the blue rifts of the glaciers, and the noble Niesen\r\ntowering over the Lake of Thun, we come upon the charming little scrap\r\nwhich I have elsewhere quoted: 'Clout-nail making goes on here rather\r\nconsiderably, and is a very neat and pretty operation to observe.  I\r\nlove a smith's shop and anything relating to smithery.  My father was\r\na smith.' This is from his journal; but he is unconsciously speaking\r\nto somebody--perhaps to the world.\r\n\r\nHis description of the Staubbach, Giessbach, and of the scenic effects\r\nof sky and mountain, are all fine and sympathetic.  But amid it all,\r\nand in reference to it all, he tells his sister that 'true enjoyment\r\nis from within, not from without.' In those days Agassiz was living\r\nunder a slab of gneiss on the glacier of the Aar.  Faraday met Forbes\r\nat the Grimsel, and arranged with him an excursion to the 'Hôtel des\r\nNeufchâtelois'; but indisposition put the project out.\r\n\r\nFrom the Fort of Ham, in 1843, Faraday received a letter addressed to\r\nhim by Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte.  He read this letter to me\r\nmany years ago, and the desire, shown in various ways by the French\r\nEmperor, to turn modern science to account, has often reminded me of\r\nit since.  At the age of thirty-five the prisoner of Ham speaks of\r\n'rendering his captivity less sad by studying the great discoveries'\r\nwhich science owes to Faraday; and he asks a question which reveals\r\nhis cast of thought at the time: 'What is the most simple combination\r\nto give to a voltaic battery, in order to produce a spark capable of\r\nsetting fire to powder under water or under ground?' Should the\r\nnecessity arise, the French Emperor will not lack at the outset the\r\nbest appliances of modern science; while we, I fear, shall have to\r\nlearn the magnitude of the resources we are now neglecting amid the\r\npangs of actual war.' [Footnote: The 'science' has since been applied,\r\nwith astonishing effect, by those who had studied it far more\r\nthoroughly than the Emperor of the French.  We also, I am happy to\r\nthink, have improved the time since the above words were written\r\n[1878].]\r\n\r\nOne turns with renewed pleasure to Faraday's letters to his wife,\r\npublished in the second volume.  Here surely the loving essence of the\r\nman appears more distinctly than anywhere else. From the house of Dr.\r\nPercy, in Birmingham, he writes thus:\r\n\r\n'Here--even here the moment I leave the table, I wish I were with you\r\nIN QUIET.  Oh, what happiness is ours!  My runs into the world in this\r\nway only serve to make me esteem that happiness the more.'\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n'We have been to a grand conversazione in the town-hall, and I have\r\nnow returned to my room to talk with you, as the pleasantest and\r\nhappiest thing that I can do.  Nothing rests me so much as communion\r\nwith you.  I feel it even now as I write, and catch myself saying the\r\nwords aloud as I write them.'\r\n\r\nTake this, moreover, as indicative of his love for Nature:\r\n\r\n'After writing, I walk out in the evening hand in hand with my dear\r\nwife to enjoy the sunset; for to me who love scenery, of all that I\r\nhave seen or can see, there is none surpasses that of heaven.  A\r\nglorious sunset brings with it a thousand thoughts that delight me.'\r\n\r\nOf the numberless lights thrown upon him by the Life and Letters,'\r\nsome fall upon his religion.  In a letter to Lady Lovelace, he\r\ndescribes himself as belonging to 'a very small and despised sect of\r\nChristians, known, if known at all, as _Sandemanians_, and our hope is\r\nfounded on the faith that is in Christ.' He adds: 'I do not think it\r\nat all necessary to tie the study of the natural sciences and religion\r\ntogether, and in my intercourse with my fellow-creatures, that which\r\nis religious, and that which is philosophical, have ever been two\r\ndistinct things.' He saw clearly the danger of quitting his moorings,\r\nand his science acted indirectly as the safeguard of his faith.  For\r\nhis investigations so filled his mind as to leave no room for\r\nsceptical questionings, thus shielding from the assaults of\r\nphilosophy, the creed of his youth.  His religion was constitutional\r\nand hereditary.  It was implied in the eddies of his blood and in the\r\ntremors of his brain; and, however its outward and visible form might\r\nhave changed, Faraday would still have possessed its elemental\r\nconstituents--awe, reverence, truth, and love.\r\n\r\nIt is worth enquiring how so profoundly religious a mind, and so great\r\na teacher, would be likely to regard our present discussions on the\r\nsubject of education.  Faraday would be a 'secularist' were he now\r\nalive.  He had no sympathy with those who contemn knowledge unless it\r\nbe accompanied by dogma.  A lecture delivered before the City\r\nPhilosophical Society in 1818, when he was twenty-six years of age,\r\nexpresses the views regarding education which he entertained to the\r\nend of his life. 'First, then,' he says, 'all theological\r\nconsiderations are banished from the society, and of course from my\r\nremarks; and whatever I may say has no reference to a future state, or\r\nto the means which are to be adopted in this world in anticipation of\r\nit.  Next, I have no intention of substituting anything for religion,\r\nbut I wish to take that part of human nature which is independent of\r\nit.  Morality, philosophy, commerce, the various institutions and\r\nhabits of society, are independent of religion, and may exist either\r\nwith or without it.  They are always the same, and can dwell alike in\r\nthe breasts of those who, from opinion, are entirely opposed in the\r\nset of principles they include in the term religion, or in those who\r\nhave none.\r\n\r\n'To discriminate more closely, if possible, I will observe that we\r\nhave no right to judge religious opinions; but the human nature of\r\nthis evening is that part of man which we have a right to judge.  And\r\nI think it will be found on examination, that this humanity--as it may\r\nperhaps be called--will accord with what I have before described as\r\nbeing in our own hands so improvable and perfectible.'\r\n\r\nIn an old journal I find the following remarks on one of my earliest\r\ndinners with Faraday: 'At two o'clock he came down for me.  He, his\r\nniece, and myself, formed the party, \"I never give dinners,\" he said.\r\n\"I don't know how to give dinners, and I never dine out.  But I should\r\nnot like my friends to attribute this to a wrong cause.  I act thus\r\nfor the sake of securing time for work, and not through religious\r\nmotives, as some imagine.\"  He said grace.  I am almost ashamed to\r\ncall his prayer a \"saying Of grace.\"  In the language of Scripture, it\r\nmight be described as the petition of a son, into whose heart God had\r\nsent the Spirit of His Son, and who with absolute trust asked a\r\nblessing from his father.  We dined on roast beef, Yorkshire pudding,\r\nand potatoes; drank sherry, talked of research and its requirements,\r\nand of his habit of keeping himself free from the distractions of\r\nsociety.  He was bright and joyful--boy-like, in fact, though he is\r\nnow sixty-two.  His work excites admiration, but contact with him\r\nwarms and elevates the heart.  Here, surely, is a strong man.  I love\r\nstrength; but let me not forget the example of its union with modesty,\r\ntenderness, and sweetness, in the character of Faraday.'\r\n\r\nFaraday's progress in discovery, and the salient points of his\r\ncharacter, are well brought out by the wise choice of letters and\r\nextracts published in the volumes before us.  I will not call the\r\nlabours of the biographer final.  So great a character will challenge\r\nreconstruction.  In the coming time some sympathetic spirit, with the\r\nrequisite strength, knowledge, and solvent power, will, I doubt not,\r\nrender these materials plastic, give them more perfect organic form,\r\nand send through them, with less of interruption, the currents of\r\nFaraday's life.  'He was too good a man,' writes his present\r\nbiographer, 'for me to estimate rightly, and too great a philosopher\r\nfor me to understand thoroughly.' That may be: but the reverent\r\naffection to which we owe the discovery, selection, and arrangement of\r\nthe materials here placed before us, is probably a surer guide than\r\nmere literary skill.  The task of the artist who may wish in future\r\ntimes to reproduce the real though unobtrusive grandeur, the purity,\r\nbeauty, and childlike simplicity of him whom we have lost, will find\r\nhis chief treasury already provided for him by Dr. Bence Jones's\r\nlabour of love.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXIX.  THE COPLEY MEDALIST OF 1870.\r\n\r\nTHIRTY years ago Electro-magnetism was looked to as a motive power,\r\nwhich might possibly compete with steam.  In centres of industry, such\r\nas Manchester, attempts to investigate and apply this power were\r\nnumerous.  This is shown by the scientific literature of the time.\r\nAmong others Mr. James Prescot Joule, a resident of Manchester, took\r\nup the subject, and, in a series of papers published in Sturgeon's\r\n'Annals of Electricity' between 1839 and 1841, described various\r\nattempts at the construction and perfection of electro-magnetic\r\nengines.  The spirit in which Mr. Joule pursued these enquiries is\r\nrevealed in the following extract: 'I am particularly anxious,' he\r\nsays, 'to communicate any new arrangement in order, if possible, to\r\nforestall the monopolising designs of those who seem to regard this\r\nmost interesting subject merely in the light of pecuniary\r\nspeculation.' He was naturally led to investigate the laws of\r\nelectro-magnetic attractions, and in 1840 he announced the important\r\nprinciple that the attractive force exerted by two electromagnets, or\r\nby an electro-magnet and a mass of annealed iron, is directly\r\nproportional to the square of the strength of the magnetising current;\r\nwhile the attraction exerted between, an electro-magnet and the pole\r\nof a permanent steel magnet, varies simply as the strength of the\r\ncurrent.  These investigations were conducted independently of, though\r\na little subsequently to, the celebrated enquiries of Henry, Jacobi,\r\nand Lenz and Jacobi, on the same subject.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 1840, Mr. Joule communicated to the Royal Society a\r\npaper on the production of heat by Voltaic electricity.  In it he\r\nannounced the law that the calorific effects of equal quantities of\r\ntransmitted electricity are proportional to the resistance overcome by\r\nthe current, whatever may be the length, thickness, shape, or\r\ncharacter of the metal which closes the circuit; and also proportional\r\nto the square of the quantity of transmitted electricity.  This is a\r\nlaw of primary importance.  In another paper, presented to, but\r\ndeclined by, the Royal Society, he confirmed this law by new\r\nexperiments, and materially extended it.  He also executed experiments\r\non the heat consequent on the passage of Voltaic electricity through\r\nelectrolytes, and found, in all cases, that the heat evolved by the\r\nproper action of any Voltaic current is proportional to the square of\r\nthe intensity of that current, multiplied by the resistance to\r\nconduction which it experiences.  From this law he deduced a number of\r\nconclusions of the highest importance to electrochemistry.\r\n\r\nIt was during these enquiries, which are marked throughout by rare\r\nsagacity and originality, that the great idea of establishing\r\nquantitative relations between Mechanical Energy and Heat arose and\r\nassumed definite form in his mind.  In 1843 Mr. Joule read before the\r\nmeeting of the British Association at Cork a.  paper' On the Calorific\r\nEffects of Magneto-Electricity, and on the Mechanical Value of Heat.'\r\nEven at the present day this memoir is tough reading, and at the time\r\nit was written it must have appeared hopelessly entangled.  This, I\r\nshould think, was the reason why Faraday advised Mr. Joule not to\r\nsubmit the paper to the Royal Society.  But its drift and results are\r\nsummed up in these memorable words by its author, written some time\r\nsubsequently: 'In that paper it was demonstrated experimentally, that\r\nthe mechanical power exerted in turning a magneto-electric machine is\r\nconverted into the heat evolved by the passage of the currents of\r\ninduction through its coils; and, on the other hand, that the motive\r\npower of the electromagnetic engine is obtained at the expense of the\r\nheat due to the chemical reaction of the battery by which it is\r\nworked.' [Footnote: Phil. Mag. May, 1845.]  It is needless to dwell\r\nupon the weight and importance of this statement.\r\n\r\nConsidering the imperfections incidental to a first determination, it\r\nis not surprising that the 'mechanical values of heat,' deduced from\r\nthe different series of experiments published in 1843, varied widely\r\nfrom each other.  The lowest limit was 587, and the highest 1,026\r\nfoot-pounds, for 1 degree Fahr.  of temperature.\r\n\r\nOne noteworthy result of his enquiries, which was pointed out at the\r\ntime by Mr. Joule, had reference to the exceedingly small fraction of\r\nthe heat actually converted into useful effect in the steam-engine.\r\nThe thoughts of the celebrated Julius Robert Mayer, who was then\r\nengaged in Germany upon the same question, had moved independently in\r\nthe same groove; but to his labours due reference will be made on a\r\nfuture occasion. [Footnote: See the next Fragment.]  In the memoir now\r\nreferred to, Mr. Joule also announced that he had proved heat to be\r\nevolved during the passage of water through narrow tubes; and he\r\ndeduced from these experiments an equivalent of 770 foot-pounds, a\r\nfigure remarkably near the one now accepted.  A detached statement\r\nregarding the origin and convertibility of animal heat strikingly\r\nillustrates the penetration of Mr. Joule, and his mastery of\r\nprinciples, at the period now referred to.  A friend had mentioned to\r\nhim Haller's hypothesis, that animal heat might arise from the\r\nfriction of the blood in the veins and arteries.  'It is\r\nunquestionable,' writes Mr. Joule,'  that heat is produced by such\r\nfriction; but it must be understood that the mechanical force expended\r\nin the friction is a part of the force of affinity which causes the\r\nvenous blood to unite with oxygen, so that the whole heat of the\r\nsystem must still be referred to the chemical changes.  But if the\r\nanimal were engaged in turning a piece of machinery, or in ascending a\r\nmountain, I apprehend that in proportion to the muscular effort put\r\nforth for the purpose, a _diminution_ of the heat evolved in the system\r\nby a given chemical action would be experienced.' The italics in this\r\nmemorable passage, written, it is to be remembered, in 1843, are Mr.\r\nJoule's own.\r\n\r\nThe concluding paragraph of this British Association paper equally\r\nillustrates his insight and precision, regarding the nature of\r\nchemical and latent heat.  'I had,' he writes, 'endeavoured to prove\r\nthat when two atoms combine together, the heat evolved is exactly that\r\nwhich would have been evolved by the electrical current due to the\r\nchemical action taking place, and is therefore proportional to the\r\nintensity of the chemical force causing the atoms to combine.  I now\r\nventure to state more explicitly, that it is not precisely the\r\nattraction of affinity, but rather the mechanical force expended by\r\nthe atoms in falling towards one another, which determines the\r\nintensity of the current, and, consequently, the quantity of heat\r\nevolved; so that we have a simple hypothesis by which we may explain\r\nwhy heat is evolved so freely in the combination of gases, and by\r\nwhich indeed we may account \"latent heat\" as a mechanical power,\r\nprepared for action, as a watch-spring is when wound up.  Suppose, for\r\nthe sake of illustration, that 8 lbs. of oxygen and 1 lb.  of hydrogen\r\nwere presented to one another in the gaseous state, and then exploded;\r\nthe heat evolved would be about 1 degree Fahr.  in 60,000 lbs. of\r\nwater, indicating a mechanical force, expended in the combination,\r\nequal to a weight of about 50,000,000 lbs. raised to the height of one\r\nfoot.  Now if the oxygen and hydrogen could be presented to each other\r\nin a liquid state, the heat of combination would be less than before,\r\nbecause the atoms in combining would fall through less space.'  No\r\nwords of mine are needed to point out the commanding grasp of\r\nmolecular physics, in their relation to the mechanical theory of heat,\r\nimplied by this statement.\r\n\r\nPerfectly assured of the importance of the principle which his\r\nexperiments aimed at establishing, Mr. Joule did not rest content with\r\nresults presenting such discrepancies as those above referred to.  He\r\nresorted in 1844 to entirely new methods, and made elaborate\r\nexperiments on the thermal changes produced in air during its\r\nexpansion: firstly, against a pressure, and therefore performing work;\r\nsecondly, against no pressure, and therefore performing no work. He\r\nthus established anew the relation between the heat consumed and the\r\nwork done.  From five different series of experiments he deduced five\r\ndifferent mechanical equivalents, the agreement between them being far\r\ngreater than that attained in his first experiments.  The mean of them\r\nwas 802 foot-pounds.  From experiments with water agitated by a\r\npaddle-wheel, he deduced, in 1845, an equivalent of 890 foot-pounds.\r\nIn 1847 he again operated upon water and sperm-oil, agitated them by a\r\npaddle-wheel, determined their elevation of temperature, and the\r\nmechanical power which produced it.  From the one he derived an\r\nequivalent of 781.6 foot-pounds; from the other an equivalent of 782.1\r\nfoot-pounds.  The mean of these two very close determinations is 781.8\r\nfoot-pounds.\r\n\r\nBy this time the labours of the previous ten years had made Mr. Joule\r\ncompletely master of the conditions essential to accuracy and success.\r\nBringing his ripened experience to bear upon the subject, he executed\r\nin 1849 a series of 40 experiments on the friction of water, 50\r\nexperiments on the friction of mercury, and 20 experiments on the\r\nfriction of plates of cast-iron.  He deduced from these experiments\r\nour present mechanical equivalent of heat, justly recognised all over\r\nthe world as 'Joule's equivalent.'\r\n\r\nThere are labours so great and so pregnant in consequences, that they\r\nare most highly praised when they are most simply stated.  Such are\r\nthe labours of Mr. Joule.  They constitute the experimental foundation\r\nof a principle of incalculable moment, not only to the practice, but\r\nstill more to the philosophy of Science.  Since the days of Newton,\r\nnothing more important than the theory, of which Mr. Joule is the\r\nexperimental demonstrator, has been enunciated.\r\n\r\nI have omitted all reference to the numerous minor papers with which\r\nMr. Joule has enriched scientific literature.  Nor have I alluded to\r\nthe important investigations which he has conducted jointly with Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson.  But sufficient, I think, has been here said to show\r\nthat, in conferring upon Mr. Joule the highest honour of the Royal\r\nSociety, the Council paid to genius not only a well-won tribute, but\r\none which had been fairly earned twenty years previously. [Footnote:\r\nLord Beaconsfield has recently honoured himself and England by\r\nbestowing an annual pension of 200 pounds on Dr. Joule.]\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXX.  THE COPLEY MEDALIST OF 1871.\r\n\r\nDR. JULIUS ROBERT MAYER was educated for D the medical profession. In\r\nthe summer of 1840, as he himself informs us, he was at Java, and\r\nthere observed that the venous blood of some of his patients had a\r\nsingularly bright red colour.  The observation riveted his attention;\r\nhe reasoned upon it, and came to the conclusion that the brightness of\r\nthe colour was due to the fact that a less amount of oxidation\r\nsufficed to keep up the temperature of the body in a hot climate than\r\nin a cold one.  The darkness of the venous blood he regarded as the\r\nvisible sign of the energy of the oxidation.\r\n\r\nIt would be trivial to remark that accidents such as this, appealing\r\nto minds prepared for them, have often led to great discoveries.\r\nMayer's attention was thereby drawn to the whole question of animal\r\nheat.  Lavoisier had ascribed this heat to the oxidation of the food.\r\n'One great principle,' says Mayer, 'of the physiological theory of\r\ncombustion, is that under all circumstances the same amount of fuel\r\nyields, by its perfect combustion, the same amount of heat; that this\r\nlaw holds good even for vital processes; and that hence the living\r\nbody, notwithstanding all its enigmas and wonders, is incompetent to\r\ngenerate heat out of nothing.'\r\n\r\nBut beyond the power of generating internal heat, the animal organism\r\ncan also generate heat outside of itself.  A blacksmith, for example,\r\nby hammering can heat a nail, and a savage by friction can warm wood\r\nto its point of ignition.  Now, unless we give up the physiological\r\naxiom that the living body cannot create heat out of nothing, 'we are\r\ndriven,' says Mayer, 'to the conclusion that it is the total heat\r\ngenerated within and without that is to be regarded as the true\r\ncalorific effect of the matter oxidised in the body.'\r\n\r\nFrom this, again, he inferred that the heat generated externally must\r\nstand in a fixed relation to the work expended in its production. For,\r\nsupposing the organic processes to remain the same; if it were\r\npossible, by the mere alteration of the apparatus, to generate\r\ndifferent amounts of heat by the same amount of work, it would follow\r\nthat the oxidation of the same amount of material would sometimes\r\nyield a less, sometimes a greater, quantity of heat.  'Hence,' says\r\nMayer, 'that a fixed relation subsists between heat and work, is a\r\npostulate of the physiological theory of combustion.'\r\n\r\nThis is the simple and natural account, given subsequently by Mayer\r\nhimself, of the course of thought started by his observation in Java.\r\nBut the conviction once formed, that an unalterable relation subsists\r\nbetween work and heat, it was: inevitable that Mayer should seek to\r\nexpress it numerically.  It was also inevitable that a mind like his,\r\nhaving raised itself to clearness on this important point, should push\r\nforward to consider the relationship of natural forces generally.  At\r\nthe beginning of 1842 his work had made considerable progress; but he\r\nhad become physician to the town of Heilbronn, and the duties of his\r\nprofession limited the time which he could devote to purely scientific\r\nenquiry.  He thought it wise, therefore, to secure himself against\r\naccident, and in the spring of 1842 wrote to Liebig, asking him to\r\npublish in his 'Annalen' a brief preliminary notice of the work then\r\naccomplished.  Liebig did so, and Dr. Mayer's first paper is contained\r\nin the May number of the 'Annalen' for 1842.\r\n\r\nMayer had reached his conclusions by reflecting on the complex\r\nprocesses of the living body; but his first step in public was to\r\nstate definitely the physical principles on which his physiological\r\ndeductions were to rest. He begins, therefore, with the forces of\r\ninorganic nature.  He finds in the universe two systems of causes\r\nwhich are not mutually convertible;--the different kinds of matter and\r\nthe different forms of force.  The first quality of both he affirms to\r\nbe indestructibility.  A force cannot become nothing, nor can it arise\r\nfrom nothing.  Forces are convertible but not destructible.  In the\r\nterminology of his time, he then gives clear expression to the ideas\r\nof potential and dynamic energy, illustrating his point by a weight\r\nresting upon the earth, suspended at a height above the earth, and\r\nactually falling to the earth.  He next fixes his attention on cases\r\nwhere motion is apparently destroyed, without producing other motion;\r\non the shock of inelastic bodies, for example. Under what form does\r\nthe vanished motion maintain itself?  Experiment alone, says Mayer,\r\ncan help us here.  He warms water by stirring it; he refers to the\r\nforce expended in overcoming friction.  Motion in both cases\r\ndisappears; but heat is generated, and the quantity generated is the\r\nequivalent of the motion destroyed.  'Our locomotives,' he observes\r\nwith extraordinary sagacity, 'may be compared to distilling apparatus:\r\nthe heat beneath the boiler passes into the motion of the train, and\r\nis again deposited as heat in the axles and wheels.\r\n\r\nA numerical solution of the relation between heat and work was what\r\nMayer aimed at, and towards the end of his first paper he makes the\r\nattempt.  It was known that a definite amount of air, in rising one\r\ndegree in temperature, can take up two different amounts of heat.  If\r\nits volume be kept constant, it takes up one amount: if its pressure\r\nbe kept constant it takes up a different amount.  These two amounts\r\nare called the specific heat under constant volume and under constant\r\npressure.  The ratio of the first to the second is as 1: 1.421.  No\r\nman, to my knowledge, prior to Dr. Mayer, penetrated the significance\r\nof these two numbers.  He first saw that the excess 0.421 was not, as\r\nthen universally supposed, heat actually lodged in the gas, but heat\r\nwhich had been actually consumed by the gas in expanding against\r\npressure.  The amount of work here performed was accurately known, the\r\namount of heat consumed was also accurately known, and from these data\r\nMayer determined the mechanical equivalent of heat.  Even in this\r\nfirst paper he is able to direct attention to the enormous discrepancy\r\nbetween the theoretic power of the fuel consumed in steam-engines, and\r\ntheir useful effect.\r\n\r\nThough this paper contains but the germ of his further labours, I\r\nthink it may be safely assumed that, as regards the mechanical theory\r\nof heat, this obscure Heilbronn physician, in the year 1842, was in\r\nadvance of all the scientific men of the time.\r\n\r\nHaving, by the publication of this paper, secured himself against what\r\nhe calls 'Eventualitaeten,' he devoted every hour of his spare time\r\nto his studies, and in 1845 published a memoir which far transcends\r\nhis first one in weight and fulness, and, indeed, marks an epoch in\r\nthe history of science.  The title of Mayer's first paper was,\r\n'Remarks on the Forces of Inorganic Nature.' The title of his second\r\ngreat essay was, 'Organic Motion in its Connection with Nutrition.' In\r\nit he expands and illustrates the physical principles laid down in his\r\nfirst brief paper.\r\n\r\nHe goes fully through the calculation of the mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat.  He calculates the performances of steam-engines, and finds that\r\n100 lbs. of coal, in a good working engine, produce only the same\r\namount of heat as 95 lbs. in an unworking one; the 5 missing lbs.\r\nhaving been converted into work.  He determines the useful effect of\r\ngunpowder, and finds nine per cent. of the force of the consumed\r\ncharcoal invested on the moving ball.  He records observations on the\r\nheat generated in water agitated by the pulping engine of a paper\r\nmanufactory, and calculates the equivalent of that heat in\r\nhorse-power.  He compares chemical combination with mechanical\r\ncombination--the union of atoms with the union of falling bodies with\r\nthe earth.  He calculates the velocity with which a body starting at\r\nan infinite distance would strike the earth's surface, and finds that\r\nthe heat generated by its collision would raise an equal weight of\r\nwater 17,356' C.  in temperature.  He then determines the thermal\r\neffect which would be produced by the earth itself falling into the\r\nsun.  So that here, in 1845, we have the germ of that meteoric theory\r\nof the sun's heat which Mayer developed with such extraordinary\r\nability three years afterwards.  He also points to the almost\r\nexclusive efficacy of the sun's heat in producing mechanical motions\r\nupon the earth, winding up with the profound remark, that the heat\r\ndeveloped by friction in the wheels of our wind and water mills comes\r\nfrom the sun in the form of vibratory motion; while the heat produced\r\nby mills driven by tidal action is generated at the expense of the\r\nearth's axial rotation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus, with firm step, passed through the powers of inorganic\r\nnature, his next object is to bring his principles to bear upon the\r\nphenomena of vegetable and animal life.  Wood and coal can burn;\r\nwhence come their heat, and the work producible by that heat?  From\r\nthe immeasurable reservoir of the sun.  Nature has proposed to herself\r\nthe task of storing up the light which streams earthward from the sun,\r\nand of casting into a permanent form the most fugitive of all powers.\r\nTo this end she has overspread the earth with organisms which, while\r\nliving, take in the solar light, and by its consumption generate\r\nforces of another kind.  These organisms are plants.  The vegetable\r\nworld, indeed, constitutes the instrument whereby the wave-motion of\r\nthe sun is changed into the rigid form of chemical tension, and thus\r\nprepared for future use.  With this prevision, as shall subsequently\r\nbe shown, the existence of the human race itself is inseparably\r\nconnected.  It is to be observed that Mayer's utterances are far from\r\nbeing anticipated by vague statements regarding the 'stimulus' of\r\nlight, or regarding coal as 'bottled sunlight.' He first saw the full\r\nmeaning of De Saussure's observation as to the reducing power of the\r\nsolar rays, and gave that observation its proper place in the doctrine\r\nof conservation.  In the leaves of a tree, the carbon and oxygen of\r\ncarbonic acid, and the hydrogen and oxygen of water, are forced\r\nasunder at the expense of the sun, and the amount of power thus\r\nsacrificed is accurately restored by the combustion of the tree.  The\r\nheat and work potential in our coal strata are so much strength\r\nwithdrawn from the sun of former ages.  Mayer lays the axe to the root\r\nof the notions regarding 'vital force' which were prevalent when he\r\nwrote.  With the plain fact before us that in the absence of the solar\r\nrays plants cannot perform the work of reduction, or generate chemical\r\ntensions, it is, he contends, incredible that these tensions should be\r\ncaused by the mystic play of the vital force.  Such an hypothesis\r\nwould cut off all investigation; it would land us in a chaos of\r\nunbridled phantasy.\r\n\r\n'I count,' he says, 'therefore, upon your agreement with me when I\r\nstate, as an axiomatic truth, that during vital processes the\r\nconversion only, and never the creation of matter or force occurs.'\r\n\r\nHaving cleared his way through the vegetable world, as he had\r\npreviously done through inorganic nature, Mayer passes on to the other\r\norganic kingdom.  The physical forces collected by plants become the\r\nproperty of animals.  Animals consume vegetables, and cause them to\r\nreunite with the atmospheric oxygen.  Animal heat is thus produced;\r\nand not only animal heat, but animal motion.  There is no\r\nindistinctness about Mayer here; he grasps his subject in all its\r\ndetails, and reduces to figures the concomitants of muscular action. A\r\nbowler who imparts to an 8-lb.  ball a velocity of 30 feet, consumes\r\nin the act one tenth of a grain of carbon.  A man weighing 150 lbs,\r\nwho lifts his own body to a height of 8 feet, consumes in the act 1\r\ngrain of carbon.  In climbing a mountain 10,000 feet high, the\r\nconsumption of the same man would be 2 oz. 4 drs.  50 grs.  of carbon.\r\nBoussingault had determined experimentally the addition to be made to\r\nthe food of horses when actively working, and Liebig had determined\r\nthe addition to be made to the food of men.  Employing the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat, which he had previously calculated, Mayer proves\r\nthe additional food to be amply sufficient to cover the increased\r\noxidation.\r\n\r\nBut he does not content himself with showing, in a general way, that\r\nthe human body burns according to definite laws, when it performs\r\nmechanical work.  He seeks to determine the particular portion of the\r\nbody consumed, and in doing so executes some noteworthy calculations.\r\nThe muscles of a labourer 150 lbs. in weight weigh 64 lbs; but when\r\nperfectly desiccated they fall to 15 lbs. Were the oxidation\r\ncorresponding to that labourer's work exerted on the muscles alone,\r\nthey would be utterly consumed in 80 days.  The heart furnishes a\r\nstill more striking example.  Were the oxidation necessary to sustain\r\nthe heart's action exerted upon its own tissue, it would be utterly\r\nconsumed in 8 days.  And if we confine our attention to the two\r\nventricles, their action would be sufficient to consume the associated\r\nmuscular tissue in 3.5 days.  Here, in his own words, emphasised in\r\nhis own way, is Mayer's pregnant conclusion from these calculations:\r\n'The muscle is only the apparatus by means of which the conversion of\r\nthe force is effected; but it is not the substance consumed in the\r\nproduction of the mechanical effect.' He calls the blood 'the oil of\r\nthe lamp of life;' it is the slow-burning fluid whose chemical force,\r\nin the furnace of the capillaries, is sacrificed to produce animal\r\nmotion.  This was Mayer's conclusion twenty-six years ago.  It was in\r\ncomplete opposition to the scientific conclusions of his time; but\r\neminent investigators have since amply verified it.\r\n\r\nThus, in baldest outline, I have sought to give some notion of the\r\nfirst half of this marvellous essay.  The second half is so\r\nexclusively physiological that I do not wish to meddle with it.  I\r\nwill only add the illustration employed by Mayer to explain the action\r\nof the nerves upon the muscles.  As an engineer, by the motion of his\r\nfinger in opening a valve or loosing a detent, can liberate an amount\r\nof mechanical motion almost infinite compared with its exciting cause,\r\nso the nerves, acting upon the muscles, can unlock an amount of\r\nactivity, wholly out of proportion to the work done by the nerves\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAs regards these questions of weightiest import to the science of\r\nphysiology, Dr. Mayer, in 1845, was assuredly far in advance of all\r\nliving men.\r\n\r\nMayer grasped the mechanical theory of heat with commanding power,\r\nillustrating it and applying it in the most diverse domains. He began,\r\nas we have seen, with physical principles; he determined the numerical\r\nrelation between heat and work; he revealed the source of the energies\r\nof the vegetable world, and showed the relationship of the heat of our\r\nfires to solar heat. He followed the energies which were potential in\r\nthe vegetable, up to their local exhaustion in the animal.  But in\r\n1845 a new thought was forced upon him by his calculations.  He then,\r\nfor the first time, drew attention to the astounding amount of heat\r\ngenerated by gravity where the force has sufficient distance to act\r\nthrough.  He proved, as I have before stated, the heat of collision of\r\na body falling from an infinite distance to the earth, to be\r\nsufficient to raise the temperature of a quantity of water, equal to\r\nthe falling body in weight, 17,356°C.  He also found, in 1845, that\r\nthe gravitating force between the earth and sun was competent to\r\ngenerate an amount of heat equal to that obtainable from the\r\ncombustion of 6,000 times the weight of the earth of solid coal.  With\r\nthe quickness of genius he saw that we had here a power sufficient to\r\nproduce the enormous temperature of the sun, and also to account for\r\nthe primal molten condition of our own planet.  Mayer shows the utter\r\ninadequacy of chemical forces, as we know them, to produce or maintain\r\nthe solar temperature.  He shows that were the sun a lump of coal it\r\nwould be utterly consumed in 5,000 years.  He shows the difficulties\r\nattending the assumption that the sun is a cooling body; for,\r\nsupposing it to possess even the high specific heat of water, its\r\ntemperature would fall 15,000' in 5,000 years.  He finally concludes\r\nthat the light and heat of the sun are maintained by the constant\r\nimpact of meteoric matter.  I never ventured an opinion as to the\r\ntruth of this theory; that is a question which may still have to be\r\nfought out.  But I refer to it as an illustration of the force of\r\ngenius with which Mayer followed the mechanical theory of heat through\r\nall its applications.  Whether the meteoric theory be a matter of fact\r\nor not, with him abides the honour of proving to demonstration that\r\nthe light and heat of suns and stars may be originated and maintained\r\nby the collisions of cold planetary matter.\r\n\r\nIt is the man who with the scantiest data could accomplish all this in\r\nsix short years, and in, the hours snatched from the duties of an\r\narduous profession, that the Royal Society, in 1871, crowned with its\r\nhighest honour.\r\n\r\nComparing this brief history with that of the Copley Medalist of 1870,\r\nthe differentiating influence of 'environment,' on two minds of\r\nsimilar natural cast and endowment, comes out in an instructive\r\nmanner.  Withdrawn from mechanical appliances, Mayer fell back upon\r\nreflection, selecting with marvellous sagacity, from existing physical\r\ndata, the single result on which could be founded a calculation of the\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat.  In the midst of mechanical appliances,\r\nJoule resorted to experiment, and laid the broad and firm foundation\r\nwhich has secured for the mechanical theory the acceptance it now\r\nenjoys.  A great portion of Joule's time was occupied in actual\r\nmanipulation; freed from this, Mayer had time to follow the theory\r\ninto its most abstruse and impressive applications.  With their places\r\nreversed, however, Joule might have become Mayer, and Mayer might have\r\nbecome Joule.\r\n\r\nIt does not lie within the scope of these brief articles to enter upon\r\nthe developments of the Dynamical Theory accomplished since Joule and\r\nMayer executed their memorable labours.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXXI.  DEATH BY LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nPEOPLE in general imagine, when they think at all about the matter,\r\nthat an impression upon the nerves--a blow, for example, or the prick\r\nof a pin--is felt at the moment it is inflicted.  But this is not the\r\ncase.  The seat of sensation being the brain, to it the intelligence\r\nof any impression made upon the nerves has to be transmitted before\r\nthis impression can become manifest as consciousness.  The\r\ntransmission, moreover, requires time, and the consequence is, that a\r\nwound inflicted on a portion of the body distant from the brain is\r\nmore tardily appreciated than one inflicted adjacent to the brain.  By\r\nan extremely ingenious experimental arrangement, Helmholtz has\r\ndetermined the velocity of this nervous transmission, and finds it to\r\nbe about eighty feet a second, or less than one-thirteenth of the\r\nvelocity of sound in air.  If therefore, a whale forty feet long were\r\nwounded in the tail, it would not be conscious of the injury till half\r\na second after the wound had been inflicted. [Footnote: A most\r\nadmirable lecture on the velocity of nervous transmission has been\r\npublished by Dr. Du Bois Reymond in the 'Proceedings of the Royal\r\nInstitution' for 1866, vol. iv. p. 575.]  But this is not the only\r\ningredient in the delay.  There can scarcely be a doubt that to every\r\nact of consciousness belongs a determinate molecular arrangement of\r\nthe brain--that every thought or feeling has its physical correlative\r\nin that organ; and nothing can be more certain than that every\r\nphysical change, whether molecular or mechanical, requires time for\r\nits accomplishment.  So that, besides the interval of transmission, a\r\nstill further time is necessary for the brain to put itself in\r\norder--for its molecules to take up the motions or positions necessary\r\nto the completion of consciousness.  Helmholtz considers that\r\none-tenth of a second is demanded for this purpose.  Thus, in the case\r\nof the whale above supposed, we have first half a second consumed in\r\nthe transmission of the intelligence through the sensor nerves to the\r\nhead, one-tenth of a second consumed by the brain in completing the\r\narrangements necessary to consciousness, and, if the velocity of\r\ntransmission through the motor be the same as that through the sensor\r\nnerves, half a second in sending a command to the tail to defend\r\nitself.  Thus one second and a tenth would elapse before an impression\r\nmade upon its caudal nerves could be responded to by a whale forty\r\nfeet long.\r\n\r\nNow, it is quite conceivable that an injury might be inflicted so\r\nrapidly that within the time required by the brain to complete the\r\narrangements necessary to consciousness, its power of arrangement\r\nmight be destroyed.  In such a case, though the injury might be of a\r\nnature to cause death, this would occur without pain, Death in this\r\ncase would be simply the sudden negation of life, without any\r\nintervention of consciousness whatever.\r\n\r\nThe time required for a rifle-bullet to pass clean through a man's\r\nhead may be roughly estimated at a thousandth of a second.  Here,\r\ntherefore, we should have no room for sensation, and death would be\r\npainless.  But there are other actions which far transcend in rapidity\r\nthat of the rifle-bullet.  A flash of lightning cleaves a cloud,\r\nappearing and disappearing in less than a hundred-thousandth of a\r\nsecond, and the velocity of electricity is such as would carry it in a\r\nsingle second over a distance almost equal to that which separates the\r\nearth and moon.  It is well known that a luminous impression once made\r\nupon the retina endures for about one-sixth of a second, and that this\r\nis the reason why we see a continuous band of light when a glowing\r\ncoal is caused to pass rapidly through the air.  A body illuminated by\r\nan instantaneous flash continues to be seen for the sixth of a second\r\nafter the flash has become extinct; and if the body thus illuminated\r\nbe in motion, it appears at rest at the place where the flash falls\r\nupon it.  When a colour-top with differently-coloured sectors is\r\ncaused to spin rapidly the colours blend together.  Such a top,\r\nrotating in a dark room and illuminated by an electric spark, appears\r\nmotionless, each distinct colour being clearly seen.  Professor Dove\r\nhas found that a flash of lightning produces the same effect.  During\r\na thunderstorm he put a colour-top in exceedingly rapid motion, and\r\nfound that every flash revealed the top as a motionless object with\r\nits colours distinct.  If illuminated solely by a flash of lightning,\r\nthe motion of all bodies on the earth's surface would, as Dove has\r\nremarked, appear suspended.  A cannon-ball, for example, would have\r\nits flight apparently arrested, and would seem to hang motionless in\r\nspace as long as the luminous impression which revealed the ball\r\nremained upon the eye.\r\n\r\nIf, then, a rifle-bullet move with sufficient rapidity to destroy life\r\nwithout the interposition of sensation, much more is a flash of\r\nlightning competent to produce this effect.  Accordingly, we have\r\nwell-authenticated cases of people being struck senseless by lightning\r\nwho, on recovery, had no memory of pain.  The following circumstantial\r\ncase is described by Hemmer:\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1788, a soldier in the neighbourhood of Mannheim, being\r\novertaken by rain, placed himself under a tree, beneath which a woman\r\nhad previously taken shelter.  He looked upwards to see whether the\r\nbranches were thick enough to afford the required protection, and, in\r\ndoing so, was struck by lightning, and fell senseless to the earth.\r\nThe woman at his side experienced the shock in her foot, but was not\r\nstruck down.  Some hours afterwards the man revived, but remembered\r\nnothing about what had occurred, save the fact of his looking up at\r\nthe branches.  This was his last act of consciousness, and he passed\r\nfrom the conscious to the unconscious condition without pain.  The\r\nvisible marks of a lightning stroke are usually insignificant: the\r\nhair is sometimes burnt; slight wounds are observed; while, in some\r\ninstances, a red streak marks the track of the discharge over the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances, the discharge from a small Leyden jar is\r\nexceedingly unpleasant to me.  Some time ago I happened to stand in\r\nthe presence of a numerous audience, with a battery of fifteen large\r\nLeyden jars charged beside me.  Through some awkwardness on my part, I\r\ntouched a wire leading from the battery, and the discharge went\r\nthrough my body.  Life was absolutely blotted out for a very sensible\r\ninterval, without a trace of pain.  In a second or so consciousness\r\nreturned; I vaguely discerned the audience and apparatus, and, by the\r\nhelp of these external appearances, immediately concluded that I had\r\nreceived the battery discharge.  The intellectual consciousness of my\r\nposition was restored with exceeding rapidity, but not so the optical\r\nconsciousness.  To prevent the audience from being alarmed, I observed\r\nthat it had often been my desire to receive accidentally such a shock,\r\nand that my wish had at length been fulfilled.  But, while making this\r\nremark, the appearance which my body presented to my eyes was that of\r\na number of separate pieces.  The arms, for example, were detached\r\nfrom the trunk, and seemed suspended in the air.  In fact, memory and\r\nthe power of reasoning appeared to be complete long before the optic\r\nnerve was restored to healthy action.  But what I wish chiefly to\r\ndwell upon here is, the absolute painlessness of the shock; and there\r\ncannot, I think, be a doubt that, to a person struck dead by\r\nlightning, the passage from life to death occurs without consciousness\r\nbeing in the least degree implicated.  It is an abrupt stoppage of\r\nsensation, unaccompanied by a pang.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXXII.  SCIENCE AND THE 'SPIRITS.'\r\n\r\nTHEIR refusal to investigate 'spiritual phenomena' is often urged as a\r\nreproach against scientific men.  I here propose to give a sketch of\r\nan attempt to apply to the 'phenomena' those methods of enquiry which\r\nare found available in dealing with natural truth.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when the spirits were particularly active in this\r\ncountry, Faraday was invited, or rather entreated, by one of his\r\nfriends to meet and question them.  He had, however, already made\r\ntheir acquaintance, and did not wish to renew it.  I had not been so\r\nprivileged, and he therefore kindly arranged a transfer of the\r\ninvitation to me.  The spirits themselves named the time of meeting,\r\nand I was conducted to the place at the day and hour appointed.\r\n\r\nAbsolute unbelief in the facts was by no means my condition of mind.\r\nOn the contrary, I thought it probable that some physical principle,\r\nnot evident to the spiritualists themselves, might underlie their\r\nmanifestations.  Extraordinary effects are produced by the\r\naccumulation of small impulses.  Galileo set a heavy pendulum in\r\nmotion by the well-timed puffs of his breath.  Ellicot set one clock\r\ngoing by the ticks of another, even when the two clocks were separated\r\nby a wall.  Preconceived notions, can, moreover, vitiate, to an\r\nextraordinary degree, the testimony of even veracious persons.  Hence\r\nmy desire to witness those extraordinary phenomena, the existence of\r\nwhich seemed placed beyond a doubt by the known veracity of those who\r\nhad witnessed and described them.  The meeting took place at a private\r\nresidence in the neighbourhood of London.  My host, his intelligent\r\nwife, and a gentleman who may be called X, were in the house when I\r\narrived.  I was informed that the 'medium' had not yet made her\r\nappearance; that she was sensitive, and might resent suspicion.  It\r\nwas therefore requested that the tables and chairs should be examined\r\nbefore her arrival, in order to be assured that there was no trickery\r\nin the furniture.  This was done; and I then first learned that my\r\nhospitable host had arranged that the séance should be a dinner-party.\r\nThis was to me an unusual form of investigation; but I accepted it, as\r\none of the accidents of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe 'medium' arrived--a delicate-looking young lady, who appeared to\r\nhave suffered much from ill health.  I took her to dinner and sat\r\nclose beside her.  Facts were absent for a considerable time, a series\r\nof very wonderful narratives supplying their place.  The duty of\r\nbelief on the testimony of witnesses was frequently insisted on.  X.\r\nappeared to be a chosen spiritual agent, and told us many surprising\r\nthings.  He affirmed that, when he took a pen in his hand, an\r\ninfluence ran from his shoulder downwards, and impelled him to write\r\noracular sentences.  I listened for a time, offering no observation.\r\n'And now,' continued X, 'this power has so risen as to reveal to me\r\nthe thoughts of others.  Only this morning I told a friend what he was\r\nthinking of, and what he intended to do during the day.' Here, I\r\nthought, is something that can be at once tested.  I said immediately\r\nto X: 'If you wish to win to your cause an apostle, who will proclaim\r\nyour principles to the world from the housetop, tell me what I am now\r\nthinking of.'  X. reddened, and did not tell me my thought.\r\n\r\nSome time previously I had visited Baron Reichenbach, in Vienna, and I\r\nnow asked the young lady who sat beside me, whether she could see any\r\nof the curious things which he describes--the light emitted by\r\ncrystals, for example?  Here is the conversation which followed, as\r\nextracted from my notes, written on the day following the séance.\r\n\r\nMedium.--'Oh, yes; but I see light around all bodies.'\r\n\r\nI--'Even in perfect darkness?'\r\n\r\nMedium.--'Yes; I see luminous atmospheres round all people.  The\r\natmosphere which surrounds Mr. R. C. would fill this room with\r\nlight.'\r\n\r\nI.--'You are aware of the effects ascribed by Baron Reichenbach to\r\nmagnets?'\r\n\r\nMedium.--'Yes; but a magnet makes me terribly ill.'\r\n\r\nI.--'Am I to understand that, if this room were perfectly dark, you\r\ncould tell whether it contained a magnet, without being informed of\r\nthe fact?'\r\n\r\nMedium.--'I should know of its presence on entering the room.'\r\n\r\nI.--'How?'\r\n\r\nMedium.--'I should be rendered instantly ill.'\r\n\r\nI.--'How do you feel to-day?'\r\n\r\nMedium.--'Particularly well; I have not been so well for months.'\r\n\r\nI.--'Then, may I ask you whether there is, at the present moment, a\r\nmagnet in my possession?'\r\n\r\nThe young lady looked at me, blushed, and stammered, 'No; I am not en\r\nrapport with you.'\r\n\r\nI sat at her right hand, and a left-hand pocket, within six inches of\r\nher person, contained a magnet.\r\n\r\nOur host here deprecated discussion, as it 'exhausted the medium.' The\r\nwonderful narratives were resumed; but I had narratives of my own\r\nquite as wonderful.  These spirits, indeed, seemed clumsy creations,\r\ncompared with those with which my own work had made me familiar.  I\r\ntherefore began to match the wonders related to me by other wonders. A\r\nlady present discoursed on spiritual atmospheres, which she could see\r\nas beautiful colours when she closed her eyes.  I professed myself\r\nable to see similar colours, and, more than that, to be able to see\r\nthe interior of my own eyes.  The medium affirmed that she could see\r\nactual waves of light coming from the sun.  I retorted that men of\r\nscience could tell the exact number of waves emitted in a second, and\r\nalso their exact length.  The medium spoke of the performances of the\r\nspirits on musical instruments.  I said that such performance was\r\ngross, in comparison with a kind of music which had been discovered\r\nsome time previously by a scientific man.  Standing at a distance of\r\ntwenty feet from a jet of gas, he could command the flame to emit a\r\nmelodious note; it would obey, and continue its song for hours.  So\r\nloud was the music emitted by the gas-flame, that it might be heard by\r\nan assembly of a thousand people.  These were acknowledged to be as\r\ngreat marvels as any of those of spiritdom.  The spirits were then\r\nconsulted, and I was pronounced to be a first-class medium.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation a low knocking was heard from time to time\r\nunder the table.  These, I was told, were the spirits' knocks.  I was\r\ninformed that one knock, in answer to a question, meant 'No;' that two\r\nknocks meant 'Not yet;' and that three knocks meant 'Yes.'\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question whether I was a medium, the response was three\r\nbrisk and vigorous knocks.  I noticed that the knocks issued from a\r\nparticular locality, and therefore requested the spirits to be good\r\nenough to answer from another corner of the table.  They did not\r\ncomply; but I was assured that they would do it, and much more,\r\nby-and-by.  The knocks continuing, I turned a wine-glass upside down,\r\nand placed my ear upon it, as upon a stethoscope.  The spirits seemed\r\ndisconcerted by the act; they lost their playfulness, and did not\r\nrecover it for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nSomewhat weary of the proceedings, I once threw myself back against my\r\nchair and gazed listlessly out of the window.  While thus engaged, the\r\ntable was rudely pushed.  Attention was drawn to the wine, still\r\noscillating in the glasses, and I was asked whether that was not\r\nconvincing.  I readily granted the fact of motion, and began to feel\r\nthe delicacy of my position.  There were several pairs of arms upon\r\nthe table, and several pairs of legs under it; but how was I, without\r\noffence, to express the conviction which I really entertained?  To\r\nward off the difficulty, I again turned a wine-glass upside down and\r\nrested my ear upon it.  The rim of the glass was not level, and my\r\nhair, on touching it, caused it to vibrate, and produce a peculiar\r\nbuzzing sound.  A perfectly candid and warm-hearted old gentleman at\r\nthe opposite side of the table, whom I may call A, drew attention to\r\nthe sound, and expressed his entire belief that it was spiritual.  I,\r\nhowever, informed him that it was the moving hair acting on the glass.\r\nThe explanation was not well received; and X, in a tone of severe\r\npleasantry, demanded whether it was the hair that had moved the table.\r\nThe promptness of my negative probably satisfied him that my notion\r\nwas a very different one.\r\n\r\nThe superhuman power of the spirits was next dwelt upon.  The strength\r\nof man, it was stated, was unavailing in opposition to theirs.  No\r\nhuman power could prevent the table from moving when they pulled it.\r\nDuring the evening this pulling of the table occurred, or rather was\r\nattempted, three times.  Twice the table moved when my attention was\r\nwithdrawn from it; on a third occasion, I tried whether the act could\r\nbe provoked by an assumed air of inattention.  Grasping the table\r\nfirmly between my knees, I threw myself back in the chair, and waited,\r\nwith eyes fixed on vacancy, for the pull.  It came.  For some seconds\r\nit was pull spirit, hold muscle; the muscle, however, prevailed, and\r\nthe table remained at rest. Up to the present moment, this interesting\r\nfact is known only to the particular spirit in question and myself.\r\n\r\nA species of mental scene-painting, with which my own pursuits had\r\nlong rendered me familiar, was employed to figure the changes and\r\ndistribution of spiritual power.  The spirits, it was alleged, were\r\nprovided with atmospheres, which combined with and interpenetrated\r\neach other, and considerable ingenuity was shown in demonstrating the\r\nnecessity of time in effecting the adjustment of the atmospheres.  A\r\nrearrangement of our positions was proposed and carried out; and soon\r\nafterwards my attention was drawn to a scarcely sensible vibration on\r\nthe part of the table.  Several persons were leaning on the table at\r\nthe time, and I asked permission to touch the medium's hand.  'Oh! I\r\nknow I tremble,' was her reply.  Throwing one leg across the other, I\r\naccidentally nipped a muscle, and produced thereby an involuntary\r\nvibration of the free leg.  This vibration, I knew, must be\r\ncommunicated to the floor, and thence to the chairs of all present.  I\r\ntherefore intentionally promoted it.  My attention was promptly drawn\r\nto the motion; and a gentleman beside me, whose value as a witness I\r\nwas particularly desirous to test, expressed his belief that it was\r\nout of the compass of human power to produce so strange a tremor.  'I\r\nbelieve,' he added, earnestly, 'that it is entirely the spirits'\r\nwork.'  'So do I,' added, with heat, the candid and warmhearted old\r\ngentleman A.  'Why, sir,' he continued, 'I feel them at this moment\r\nshaking my chair.' I stopped the motion of the leg.  'Now, sir,' A.\r\nexclaimed, 'they are gone.' I began again, and A. once more affirmed\r\ntheir presence.  I could, however, notice that there were doubters\r\npresent, who did not quite know what to think of the manifestations. I\r\nsaw their perplexity; and, as there was sufficient reason to believe\r\nthat the disclosure of the secret would simply provoke anger, I kept\r\nit to myself.\r\n\r\nAgain a period of conversation intervened, during which the spirits\r\nbecame animated.  The evening was confessedly a dull one, but matters\r\nappeared to brighten towards its close.  The spirits were requested to\r\nspell the name by which I was known in the heavenly world.  Our host\r\ncommenced repeating the alphabet, and when he reached the letter 'P' a\r\nknock was heard.  He began again, and the spirits knocked at the\r\nletter 'O.'  I was puzzled, but waited for the end.  The next letter\r\nknocked down was 'E.' I laughed, and remarked that the spirits were\r\ngoing to make a poet of me.  Admonished for my levity, I was informed\r\nthat the frame of mind proper for the occasion ought to have been\r\nsuperinduced by a perusal of the Bible immediately before the séance.\r\nThe spelling, however, went on, and sure enough I came out a poet. But\r\nmatters did not end here.  Our host continued his repetition of the\r\nalphabet, and the next letter of the name proved to be '0.' Here was\r\nmanifestly an unfinished word; and the spirits were apparently in\r\ntheir most communicative mood.  The knocks came from under the table,\r\nbut no person present evinced the slightest desire to look under it. I\r\nasked whether I might go underneath; the permission was granted; so I\r\ncrept under the table.  Some tittered; but the candid old A.\r\nexclaimed, 'He has a right to look into the very dregs of it, to\r\nconvince himself.' Having pretty well assured myself that no sound\r\ncould be produced under the table without its origin being revealed, I\r\nrequested our host to continued his questions.  He did so, but in\r\nvain.  He adopted a tone of tender entreaty; but the 'dear spirits'\r\nhad become dumb dogs, and refused to be entreated.  I continued under\r\nthat table for at least a quarter of an hour, after which, with a\r\nfeeling of despair as regards the prospects of humanity never before\r\nexperienced, I regained my chair.  Once there, the spirits resumed\r\ntheir loquacity, and dubbed me 'Poet of Science.'\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the result of an attempt made by a scientific man to\r\nlook into these spiritual phenomena.  It is not encouraging; and for\r\nthis reason.  The present promoters of spiritual phenomena divide\r\nthemselves into two classes, one of which needs no demonstration,\r\nwhile the other is beyond the reach of proof.  The victims like to\r\nbelieve, and they do not like to be undeceived.  Science is perfectly\r\npowerless in the presence of this frame of mind.  It is, moreover, a\r\nstate perfectly compatible with extreme intellectual subtlety and a\r\ncapacity for devising hypotheses which only require the hardihood\r\nengendered by strong conviction, or by callous mendacity, to render\r\nthem impregnable.  The logical feebleness of science is not\r\nsufficiently borne in mind.  It keeps down the weed of superstition,\r\nnot by logic but by, slowly rendering the mental soil unfit for its\r\ncultivation.  When science appeals to uniform experience, the\r\nspiritualist will retort, 'How do you know that a uniform experience\r\nwill continue uniform?  You tell me that the sun has risen for six\r\nthousand years: that is no proof that it will rise tomorrow; within\r\nthe next twelve hours it may be puffed out by the Almighty.'  Taking\r\nthis ground, a man may maintain the story of 'Jack and the Beanstalk'\r\nin the face of all the science in the world.  You urge, in vain, that\r\nscience has given us all the knowledge of the universe which we now\r\npossess, while spiritualism has added nothing to that knowledge.  The\r\ndrugged soul is beyond the reach of reason.  It is in vain that\r\nimpostors are exposed, and the special demon cast out.  He has but\r\nslightly to change his shape, return to his house, and find it 'empty,\r\nswept, and garnished.'\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nSince the time when the foregoing remarks were written I have been\r\nmore than once among the spirits, at their own invitation.  They do\r\nnot improve on acquaintance.  Surely no baser delusion ever obtained\r\ndominance over the weak mind of man.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY\r\n\r\nSPOTTISWOODE AND Co, NEW-STREET SQUARE\r\n\r\nAND PARLIAMENT STREET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTS OF SCIENCE:\r\n\r\nA SERIES OF DETACHED ESSAYS, ADDRESSES, AND REVIEWS.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nJOHN TYNDALL, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY\r\n\r\nSPOTTISWOODE AND CO, NEW-STREET SQUARE\r\n\r\nAND PARLIAMENT STREET\r\n\r\nSIXTH EDITION.\r\n\r\nVOL.

REFLECTIONS ON PRAYER AND NATURAL LAW.\r\n\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nAMID the apparent confusion and caprice of natural phenomena, which\r\nroused emotions hostile to calm investigation, it must for ages have\r\nseemed hopeless to seek for law or orderly relation; and before the\r\nthought of law dawned upon the unfolding human mind these otherwise\r\ninexplicable effects were referred to personal agency.  In the fall of\r\na cataract the savage saw the leap of a spirit, and the echoed\r\nthunder-peal was to him the hammer-clang of an exasperated god.\r\nPropitiation of these terrible powers was the consequence, and\r\nsacrifice was offered to the demons of earth and air.\r\n\r\nBut observation tends to chasten the emotions and to check those\r\nstructural efforts of the intellect which have emotion for their base.\r\nOne by one natural phenomena came to be associated with their\r\nproximate causes; the idea of direct personal volition mixing itself\r\nwith the economy of nature retreating more and more.  Many of us fear\r\nthis change.  Our religious feelings are dear to us, and we look with\r\nsuspicion and dislike on any philosophy, the apparent tendency of\r\nwhich is to dry them up.  Probably every change from ancient savagery\r\nto our present enlightenment has excited, in a greater or less degree,\r\nfears of this kind.  But the fact is, that we have not yet determined\r\nwhether its present form is necessary to the life and warmth of\r\nreligious feeling.  We may err in linking the imperishable with the\r\ntransitory, and confound the living plant with the decaying pole to\r\nwhich it clings.  My object, however, at present is not to argue, but\r\nto mark a tendency.  We have ceased to propitiate the powers of\r\nnature--ceased even to pray for things in manifest contradiction to\r\nnatural laws.  In Protestant countries, at least, I think it is\r\nconceded that the age of miracles is past.\r\n\r\nAt an auberge near the foot of the Rhone glacier, I met, in the summer\r\nof 1858, an athletic young priest, who, after a solid breakfast,\r\nincluding a bottle of wine, informed me that he had come up to 'bless\r\nthe mountains.' This was the annual custom of the place.  Year by year\r\nthe Highest was entreated, by official intercessors, to make such\r\nmeteorological arrangements as should ensure food and shelter for the\r\nflocks and herds of the Valaisians.  A diversion of the Rhone, or a\r\ndeepening of the river's bed, would, at the time I now mention, have\r\nbeen of incalculable benefit to the inhabitants of the valley.  But\r\nthe priest would have shrunk from the idea of asking the Omnipotent to\r\nopen a new channel for the river, or to cause a portion of it to flow\r\nover the Grimsel pass, and down the valley of Oberhasli to Brientz.\r\nThis he would have deemed a miracle, and he did not come to ask the\r\nCreator to perform miracles, but to do something which he manifestly\r\nthought lay quite within the bounds of the natural and non-miraculous.\r\nA Protestant gentleman who was present at the time smiled at this\r\nrecital.  He had no faith in the priest's blessing; still, he deemed\r\nhis prayer different in kind from a request to open a new river-cut,\r\nor to cause the water to flow up-hill.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner the same Protestant gentleman would doubtless\r\nsmile at the honest Tyrolese priest, who, when he feared the bursting\r\nof a glacier dam, offered the sacrifice of the Mass upon the ice as a\r\nmeans of averting the calamity.  That poor man did not expect to\r\nconvert the ice into adamant, or to strengthen its texture, so as to\r\nenable it to withstand the pressure of the water; nor did he expect\r\nthat his sacrifice would cause the stream to roll back upon its source\r\nand relieve him, by a miracle, of its presence.  But beyond the\r\nboundaries of his knowledge lay a region where rain was generated, he\r\nknew not how.  He was not so presumptuous as to expect a miracle, but\r\nhe firmly believed that in yonder cloud-land matters could be so\r\narranged, without trespass on the miraculous, that the stream which\r\nthreatened him and his people should be caused to shrink within its\r\nproper bounds.\r\n\r\nBoth these priests fashioned that which they did not understand to\r\ntheir respective wants and wishes.  In their case imagination came\r\ninto play, uncontrolled by a knowledge of law.  A similar state of\r\nmind was long prevalent among mechanicians.  Many of these, among whom\r\nwere to be reckoned men of consummate skill, were occupied a century\r\nago with the question of perpetual motion.  They aimed at constructing\r\na machine which should execute work without the expenditure of power;\r\nand some of them went mad in the pursuit of this object.  The faith in\r\nsuch a consummation, involving, as it did, immense personal profit to\r\nthe inventor, was extremely exciting, and every attempt to destroy\r\nthis faith was met by bitter resentment on the part of those who held\r\nit.  Gradually, however, as men became more and more acquainted with\r\nthe true functions of machinery, the dream dissolved.  The hope of\r\ngetting work out of mere mechanical combinations disappeared: but\r\nstill there remained for the speculator a cloud-land denser than that\r\nwhich filled the imagination of the Tyrolese priest, and out of which\r\nhe still hoped to evolve perpetual motion.  There was the mystic store\r\nof chemic force, which nobody understood; there were heat and light,\r\nelectricity and magnetism, all competent to produce mechanical motion.\r\n[Footnote: See Helmholtz: 'Wechselwirkung der Naturkräfte.']  Here,\r\nthen, was the mine in which our gem must be sought.  A modified and\r\nmore refined form of the ancient faith revived; and, for aught I know,\r\na remnant of sanguine designers may at the present moment be engaged\r\non the problem which like-minded men in former ages left unsolved.\r\n\r\nAnd why should a perpetual motion, even under modern conditions, be\r\nimpossible?  The answer to this question is the statement of that\r\ngreat generalisation of modern science, which is known under the name\r\nof the Conservation of Energy.  This principle asserts that no power\r\ncan make its appearance in nature without an equivalent expenditure of\r\nsome other power; that natural agents are so related to each other as\r\nto be mutually convertible, but that no new agency is created.  Light\r\nruns into heat; heat into electricity; electricity into magnetism;\r\nmagnetism into mechanical force; and mechanical force again into light\r\nand heat.  The Proteus changes, but he is ever the same; and his\r\nchanges in nature, supposing no miracle to supervene, are the\r\nexpression, not of spontaneity, but of physical necessity.  A\r\nperpetual motion, then, is deemed impossible, because it demands the\r\ncreation of energy, whereas the principle of Conservation is--no\r\ncreation, but infinite conversion.\r\n\r\nIt is an old remark that the law which moulds a tear also rounds a\r\nplanet.  In the application of law in nature the terms great and small\r\nare unknown.  Thus the principle referred to teaches us that the\r\nItalian wind, gliding over the crest of the Matterhorn, is as firmly\r\nruled as the earth in its orbital revolution round the sun; and that\r\nthe fall of its vapour into clouds is exactly as much a matter of\r\nnecessity as the return of the seasons.  The dispersion, therefore, of\r\nthe slightest mist by the special volition of the Eternal, would be as\r\nmuch a miracle as the rolling of the Rhone over the Grimsel\r\nprecipices, down the valley of Hash to Meyringen and Brientz.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me quite beyond the present power of science to\r\ndemonstrate that the Tyrolese priest, or his colleague of the Rhone\r\nvalley, asked for an 'impossibility' in praying for good weather; but\r\nScience can demonstrate the incompleteness of the knowledge of nature\r\nwhich limited their prayers to this narrow ground; and she may lessen\r\nthe number of instances in which we 'ask amiss,' by showing that we\r\nsometimes pray for the performance of a miracle when we do not intend\r\nit.  She does assert, for example, that without a disturbance of\r\nnatural law, quite as serious as the stoppage of an eclipse, or the\r\nrolling of the river Niagara up the Falls, no act of humiliation,\r\nindividual or national, could call one shower from heaven, or deflect\r\ntowards us a single beam of the sun.\r\n\r\nThose, therefore, who believe that the miraculous is still active in\r\nnature, may, with perfect consistency, join in our periodic prayers\r\nfor fair weather and for rain: while those who hold that the age of\r\nmiracles is past, will, if they be consistent, refuse to join in these\r\npetitions.  And these latter, if they wish to fall back upon such a\r\njustification, may fairly urge that the latest conclusions of science\r\nare in perfect accordance with the doctrine of the Master himself,\r\nwhich manifestly was that the distribution of natural phenomena is not\r\naffected by moral or religious causes.  'He maketh His sun to rise on\r\nthe evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the\r\nunjust.' Granting 'the power of Free Will in man,' so strongly claimed\r\nby Professor Mansel in his admirable defence of the belief in\r\nmiracles, and assuming the efficacy of free prayer to produce changes\r\nin external nature, it necessarily follows that natural laws are more\r\nor less at the mercy of man's volition, and no conclusion founded on\r\nthe assumed permanence of those laws would be worthy of confidence.\r\n\r\nIt is a wholesome sign for England that she numbers among her clergy\r\nmen wise enough to understand all this, and courageous enough to act\r\nup to their knowledge.  Such men do service to public character, by\r\nencouraging a manly and intelligent conflict with the real causes of\r\ndisease and scarcity, instead of a delusive reliance on supernatural\r\naid.  But they have also a value beyond this local and temporary one.\r\nThey prepare the public mind for changes, which though inevitable,\r\ncould hardly, without such preparation, be wrought without violence.\r\nIron is strong; still, water in crystallising will shiver an iron\r\nenvelope, and the more unyielding the metal is, the worse for its\r\nsafety.  There are in the world men who would encompass philosophic\r\nspeculation by a rigid envelope, hoping thereby to restrain it, but in\r\nreality giving it explosive force.  In England, thanks to men of the\r\nstamp to which I have alluded, scope is gradually given to thought for\r\nchanges of aggregation, and the envelope slowly alters its form, in\r\naccordance with the necessities of the time.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe proximate origin of the foregoing slight article, and probably the\r\nremoter origin of the next following one, was this.  Some years ago, a\r\nday of prayer and humiliation, on account of a bad harvest, was\r\nappointed by the proper religious authorities; but certain clergymen\r\nof the Church of England, doubting the wisdom of the demonstration,\r\ndeclined to join in the services of the day.  For this act of\r\nnonconformity they were severely censured by some of their brethren.\r\nRightly or wrongly, my sympathies were on the side of these men; and,\r\nto lend them a helping hand in their struggle against odds, I inserted\r\nthe foregoing chapter in a little book entitled 'Mountaineering in\r\n1861.'  Some time subsequently I received from a gentleman of great\r\nweight and distinction in the scientific world, and, I believe, of\r\nperfect orthodoxy in the religious one, a note directing my attention\r\nto an exceedingly thoughtful article on Prayer and Cholera in the\r\n'Pall Mall Gazette.' My eminent correspondent deemed the article a\r\nfair answer to the remarks made by me in 1861.  I, also, was struck by\r\nthe temper and ability of the article, but I could not deem its\r\narguments satisfactory, and in a short note to the editor of the 'Pall\r\nMall Gazette' I ventured to state so much.  This letter elicited some\r\nvery able replies, and a second leading article was also devoted to\r\nthe subject.  In answer to all, I risked the publication of a second\r\nletter, and soon afterwards, by an extremely courteous note from the\r\neditor, the discussion was closed.\r\n\r\nThough thus stopped locally, the discussion flowed in other\r\ndirections.  Sermons were preached, essays were published, articles\r\nwere written, while a copious correspondence occupied the pages of\r\nsome of the religious newspapers.  It gave me sincere pleasure to\r\nnotice that the discussion, save in a few cases where natural\r\ncoarseness had the upper hand, was conducted with a minimum of\r\nvituperation.  The severity shown was hardly more than sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate earnestness, while gentlemanly feeling was too predominant\r\nto permit that earnestness to contract itself to bigotry or to clothe\r\nitself in abuse.  It was probably the memory of this discussion which\r\ncaused another excellent friend of mine to recommend to my perusal the\r\nexceedingly able work which in the next article I have endeavoured to\r\nreview.\r\n\r\nMr. Mozley's book belongs to that class of writing of which Butler may\r\nbe taken as the type.  It is strong, genuine argument about difficult\r\nmatters, fairly tracing what is difficult, fairly trying to grapple,\r\nnot with what appears the gist and strong point of a question, but\r\nwith what really at bottom is the knot of it.  It is a book the\r\nreasoning of which may not satisfy everyone... But we think it is a\r\nbook for people who wish to see a great subject handled on a scale\r\nwhich befits it, and with a perception of its real elements.  It is a\r\nbook which will have attractions for those who like to see a powerful\r\nmind applying itself, without shrinking or holding back, without trick\r\nor reserve or show of any kind, as a wrestler closes body to body with\r\nhis antagonist, to the strength of an adverse and powerful\r\nargument.--Times, Tuesday, June 5, 1866.\r\n\r\nWe should add, that the faults of the work are wholly on the surface\r\nand in the arrangement; that the matter is as solid and as logical as\r\nthat of any book within recent memory, and that it abounds in striking\r\npassages, of which we have scarcely been able even to give a sample.\r\nNo future arguer against miracles can afford to pass it\r\nover.--SATURDAY REVIEW, September 15, 1866.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nII  MIRACLES AND SPECIAL PROVIDENCES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Fortnightly Review, New Series, vol. i. p. 645.]\r\n\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nIT is my privilege to enjoy the friendship of a select number of\r\nreligious men, with whom I converse frankly upon theological subjects,\r\nexpressing without disguise the notions and opinions I entertain\r\nregarding their tenets, and hearing in return these notions and\r\nopinions subjected to criticism.  I have thus far found them liberal\r\nand loving men, patient in hearing, tolerant in reply, who know how to\r\nreconcile the duties of courtesy with the earnestness of debate.  From\r\none of these, nearly a year ago, I received a note, recommending\r\nstrongly to my attention the volume of 'Bampton Lectures' for 1865, in\r\nwhich the question of miracles is treated by Mr. Mozley.  Previous to\r\nreceiving this note, I had in part made the acquaintance of the work\r\nthrough an able and elaborate review of it in the 'Times.' The\r\ncombined effect of the letter and the review was to make the book the\r\ncompanion of my summer tour in the Alps.  There, during the wet and\r\nsnowy days which were only too prevalent in 1866, and during the days\r\nof rest interpolated between days of toil, I made myself more\r\nthoroughly conversant with Mr. Mozley's volume.  I found it clear and\r\nstrong--an intellectual tonic, as bracing and pleasant to my mind as\r\nthe keen air of the mountains was to my body.  From time to time I\r\njotted down thoughts regarding it, intending afterwards to work them\r\nup into a coherent whole.  Other duties, however, interfered with the\r\ncomplete carrying out of this intention, and what I wrote last summer\r\nI now publish, not hoping to be able, within any reasonable time, to\r\nrender my defence of scientific method more complete.\r\n\r\nMr. Mozley refers at the outset of his task to the movement against\r\nmiracles which of late years has taken place, and which determined his\r\nchoice of a subject.  He acquits modern science of having had any\r\ngreat share in the production of this movement.  The objection against\r\nmiracles, he says, does not arise from any minute knowledge of the\r\nlaws of nature, but simply because they are opposed to that plain and\r\nobvious order of nature which everybody sees.  The present movement\r\nis, he thinks, to be ascribed to the greater earnestness and\r\npenetration of the present age.  Formerly miracles were accepted\r\nwithout question, because without reflection; but the exercise of the\r\n'historic imagination' is a characteristic of our own time.  Men are\r\nnow accustomed to place before themselves vivid images of historic\r\nfacts; and when a miracle rises to view, they halt before the\r\nastounding occurrence, and, realising it with the same clearness as if\r\nit were now passing before their eyes, they ask themselves, 'Can this\r\nhave taken place?' In some instances the effort to answer this\r\nquestion has led to a disbelief in miracles, in others to a\r\nstrengthening of belief.  The aim of Mr. Mozley's lectures is to show\r\nthat the strengthening of belief is the logical result which ought to\r\nfollow from the examination of the facts.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made by religious men to bring the Scripture\r\nmiracles within the scope of the order of nature, but all such\r\nattempts are rejected by Mr. Mozley as utterly futile and wide of the\r\nmark. Regarding miracles as a necessary accompaniment of a revelation,\r\ntheir evidential value in his eyes depends entirely upon their\r\ndeviation from the order of nature.  Thus deviating, they suggest and\r\nillustrate a power higher than nature, a 'personal will;' and they\r\ncommend the person in whom this power is vested as a messenger from on\r\nhigh.  Without these credentials such a messenger would have no right\r\nto demand belief, even were his assertions regarding his Divine\r\nmission backed by a holy life.  Nor is it by miracles alone that the\r\norder of nature is, or may be, disturbed.  The material universe is\r\nalso the arena of 'special providences.'  Under these two heads Mr.\r\nMozley distributes the total preternatural.  One form of the\r\npreternatural may shade into the other, as one colour passes into\r\nanother in the rainbow; but, while the line which divides the\r\nspecially providential from the miraculous cannot be sharply drawn,\r\ntheir distinction broadly expressed is this: that, while a special\r\nprovidence can only excite surmise more or less probable, it is 'the\r\nnature of a miracle to give proof, as distinguished from surmise, of\r\nDivine design.'\r\n\r\nMr. Mozley adduces various illustrations of what he regards to be\r\nspecial providences, as distinguished from miracles.  'The death of\r\nArius,' he says, 'was not miraculous, because the coincidence of the\r\ndeath of a heresiarch taking place when it was peculiarly advantageous\r\nto the orthodox faith ... was not such as to compel the inference\r\nof extraordinary Divine agency; but it was a special providence,\r\nbecause it carried a reasonable appearance of it.  The miracle of the\r\nThundering Legion was a special providence, but not a miracle, for\r\nthe same reason, because the coincidence of an instantaneous fall of\r\nrain, in answer to prayer, carried some appearance, but not proof, of\r\npreternatural agency.'\r\n\r\nThe eminent lecturer's remarks on this head brought to my recollection\r\ncertain narratives published in Methodist magazines, which I used to\r\nread with avidity when a boy.  The general title of these exciting\r\nstories, if I remember right, was 'The Providence of God asserted,'\r\nand in them the most extraordinary escapes from peril were recounted\r\nand ascribed to prayer, while equally wonderful instances of calamity\r\nwere adduced as illustrations of Divine retribution.  In such\r\nmagazines, or elsewhere, I found recorded the case of the celebrated\r\nSamuel Hick, which, as it illustrates a whole class of special\r\nprovidences approaching in conclusiveness to miracles, is worthy of\r\nmention here.  It is related of this holy man that, on one occasion,\r\nflour was lacking to make the sacramental bread.  Grain was present,\r\nand a windmill was present, but there was no wind to grind the corn.\r\nWith faith undoubting, Samuel Hick prayed to the Lord of the winds:\r\nthe sails turned, the corn was ground, after which the wind ceased.\r\nAccording to the canon of the Bampton Lecturer, this, though carrying\r\na strong appearance of an immediate exertion of Divine energy, lacks\r\nby a hair's-breadth the quality of a miracle.  For the wind _might_ have\r\narisen, and _might_ have ceased, in the ordinary course of nature. Hence\r\nthe occurrence did not 'compel the inference of extraordinary Divine\r\nagency.'  In like manner Mr. Mozley considers that 'the appearance of\r\nthe cross to Constantine was a miracle, or a special providence,\r\naccording to what account of it we adopt.  As only a meteoric\r\nappearance in the shape of a cross it gave some token of preternatural\r\nagency, but not full evidence.'\r\n\r\nIn the Catholic canton of Switzerland where I now write, and still\r\nmore among the pious Tyrolese, the mountains are dotted with shrines,\r\ncontaining offerings of all kinds, in acknowledgment of special\r\nmercies--legs, feet, arms, and hands--of gold, silver, brass, and\r\nwood, according as worldly possessions enabled the grateful heart to\r\nexpress its indebtedness.  Most of these offerings are made to the\r\nVirgin Mary.  They are recognitions of 'special providences,' wrought\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the Mother of God.  Mr. Mozley's\r\nbelief, that of the Methodist chronicler, and that of the Tyrolese\r\npeasant, are substantially the same.  Each of them assumes that\r\nnature, instead of flowing ever onward in the uninterrupted rhythm of\r\ncause and effect, is mediately ruled by the free human will.  As\r\nregards _direct_ action upon natural phenomena, man's wish and will, as\r\nexpressed in prayer, are confessedly powerless; but prayer is the\r\ntrigger which liberates the Divine power, and to this extent, if the\r\nwill be free, man, of course, commands nature.\r\n\r\nDid the existence of this belief depend solely upon the material\r\nbenefits derived from it, it could not, in my opinion, last a decade.\r\nAs a purely objective fact, we should soon see that the distribution\r\nof natural phenomena is unaffected by the merits or the demerits of\r\nmen; that the law of gravitation crushes the simple worshippers of\r\nOttery St. Mary, while singing their hymns, just as surely as if they\r\nwere engaged in a midnight brawl.  The hold of this belief upon the\r\nhuman mind is not due to outward verification, but to the inner\r\nwarmth, force, and elevation with which it is commonly associated.  It\r\nis plain, however, that these feelings may exist under the most\r\nvarious forms.  They are not limited to Church of England\r\nProtestantism--they are not even limited to Christianity.  Though less\r\nrefined, they are certainly not less strong in the heart of the\r\nMethodist and the Tyrolese peasant than in the heart of Mr. Mozley.\r\nIndeed, those feelings belong to the primal powers of man's nature.  A\r\n'sceptic' may have them.  They find vent in the battle-cry of the\r\nMoslem.  They take hue and form in the hunting-grounds of the Red\r\nIndian; and raise all of them, as they raise the Christian, upon a\r\nwave of victory, above the terrors of the grave.\r\n\r\nThe character, then, of a miracle, as distinguished from a special\r\nprovidence, is that the former furnishes _proof_, while in the case of\r\nthe latter we have only surmise.  Dissolve the element of doubt, and\r\nthe alleged fact passes from the one class of 'the preternatural into\r\nthe other.  In other words, if a special providence could be proved to\r\nbe a special providence, it would cease to be a special providence and\r\nbecome a miracle.  There is not the least cloudiness about Mr.\r\nMozley's meaning here.  A special providence is a doubtful miracle.\r\nWhy, then, not call it so?  The term employed by Mr. Mozley conveys no\r\nnegative suggestion, whereas the negation of certainty is the peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of the thing intended to be expressed.  There is an\r\napparent unwillingness on the part of the lecturer to call a special\r\nprovidence what his own definition makes it to be.  Instead of\r\nspeaking of it as a doubtful miracle, he calls it 'an invisible\r\nmiracle.' He speaks of the point of contact of supernatural power with\r\nthe chain of causation being so high up as to be wholly, or in part,\r\nout of sight, whereas the essence of a special providence is the\r\nuncertainty whether there is any contact at all, either high or low.\r\nBy the use of an incorrect term, however, a grave danger is avoided.\r\nFor the idea of doubt, if kept systematically before the mind, would\r\nsoon be fatal to the special providence, considered as a means of\r\nedification.  The term employed, on the contrary, invites and\r\nencourages the trust which is necessary to supplement the evidence.\r\n\r\nThis inner trust, though at first rejected by Mr. Mozley in favour of\r\nexternal proof, is subsequently called upon to do momentous duty in\r\nregard to miracles.  Whenever the evidence of the miraculous seems\r\nincommensurate with the fact which it has to establish, or rather\r\nwhen the fact is so amazing that hardly any evidence is sufficient to\r\nestablish it, Mr. Mozley invokes 'the affections.'  They must urge the\r\nreason to accept the conclusion, from which unaided it recoils.  The\r\naffections and emotions are eminently the court of appeal in matters\r\nof real religion, which is an affair of the heart; but they are not, I\r\nsubmit, the court in which to weigh allegations regarding the\r\ncredibility of physical facts.  These must be judged by the dry light\r\nof the intellect alone, appeals to the affections being reserved for\r\ncases where moral elevation, and not historic conviction, is the aim.\r\nIt is, moreover, because the result, in the case under consideration,\r\nis deemed desirable that the affections are called upon to back it. If\r\nundesirable, they would, with equal right, be called upon to act the\r\nother way.  Even to the disciplined scientific mind this would be a\r\ndangerous doctrine.  A favourite theory--the desire to establish or\r\navoid a certain n result--can so warp the mind as to destroy its\r\npowers of estimating facts.  I have known men to work for years under\r\na fascination of this kind, unable to extricate themselves from its\r\nfatal influence.  They had certain data, but not, as it happened,\r\nenough.  By a process exactly analogous to that invoked by Mr. Mozley,\r\nthey supplemented the data, and went wrong.  From that hour their\r\nintellects were so blinded to the perception of adverse phenomena that\r\nthey never reached truth.  If, then, to the disciplined scientific\r\nmind, this incongruous mixture of proof and trust be fraught with\r\ndanger, what must it be to the indiscriminate audience which.  Mr.\r\nMozley addresses?  In calling upon this agency he acts the part of\r\nFrankenstein.  It is a monster thus evoked that we see stalking\r\nabroad, in the degrading spiritualistic phenomena of the present day.\r\nAgain, I say, where the aim is to elevate the mind, to quicken the\r\nmoral sense, to kindle the fire of religion in the soul, let the\r\naffections by all means be invoked; but they must not be permitted to\r\ncolour our reports, or to influence our acceptance of reports of\r\noccurrences in external nature.  Testimony as to natural facts is\r\nworthless when wrapped in this atmosphere of the affections; the most\r\nearnest subjective truth being thus rendered perfectly compatible with\r\nthe most astounding objective error.\r\n\r\nThere are questions in judging of which the affections or sympathies\r\nare often our best guides, the estimation of moral goodness being one\r\nof these.  But at this precise point, where they are really of use,\r\nMr. Mozley excludes the affections and demands a miracle as a\r\ncertificate of character.  He will not accept any other evidence of\r\nthe perfect goodness of Christ. 'No outward life and conduct,' he\r\nsays, 'however irreproachable, could prove His perfect sinlessness,\r\nbecause goodness depends upon the inward motive, and the perfection of\r\nthe inward motive is not proved by the outward act.' But surely the\r\nmiracle is an outward act, and to pass from it to the inner motive\r\nimposes a greater strain upon logic than that involved in our\r\nordinary methods of estimating men.  There is, at least, moral\r\ncongruity between the outward goodness and the inner life, but there\r\nis no such congruity between the miracle and the life within.  The\r\ntest of moral goodness laid down by Mr. Mozley is not the test of\r\nJohn, who says, 'He that doeth righteousness is righteous; 'nor is it\r\nthe test of Jesus: 'By their fruits ye shall know them: do men gather\r\ngrapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?'  But it is the test of\r\nanother: 'If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be\r\nmade bread.' For my own part, I prefer the attitude of Fichte to that\r\nof Mr. Mozley.  The Jesus of John,' says this noble and mighty\r\nthinker, knows no other God than the True God, in whom we all are, and\r\nlive, and may be blessed, and out of whom there is only Death and\r\nNothingness.  And,' continues Fichte, 'he appeals, and rightly\r\nappeals, in support of this truth, not to reasoning, but to the inward\r\npractical sense of truth in man, not even knowing any other proof than\r\nthis inward testimony, \"If any man will do the will of Him who sent\r\nMe, he shall know of the doe-trine whether it be of God.\"'\r\n\r\nAccepting Mr. Mozley's test, with which alone I am now dealing, it is\r\nevident that, in the demonstration of moral goodness, the _quantity_ of\r\nthe miraculous comes into play.  Had Christ, for example, limited\r\nhimself to the conversion of water into wine, He would have fallen\r\nshort of the performance of Jannes and Jambres; for it is a smaller\r\nthing to convert one liquid into another than to convert a dead rod\r\ninto a living serpent.  But Jannes and Jambres, we are informed, were\r\nnot good.  Hence, if Mr. Mozley's test be a true one, a point must\r\nexist, on the one side of which miraculous power demonstrates\r\ngoodness, while on the other side it does not.  How is this 'point of\r\ncontrary flexure' to be determined?  It must lie somewhere between the\r\nmagicians and Moses, for within this space the power passed from the\r\ndiabolical to the Divine.  But how to mark the point of passage--how,\r\nout of a purely _quantitative_ difference in the visible manifestation\r\nof power, we are to infer a total inversion of quality--it is\r\nextremely difficult to see.  Moses, we are informed, produced a large\r\nreptile; Jannes and Jambres produced a small one.  I do not possess\r\nthe intellectual faculty which would enable me to infer, from those\r\ndata, either the goodness of the one or the badness of the other; and\r\nin the highest recorded manifestations of the miraculous I am equally\r\nat a loss.  Let us not play fast and loose with the miraculous; either\r\nit is a demonstration of goodness in all cases or in none.  If Mr.\r\nMozley accepts Christ's goodness as transcendent, because He did such\r\nworks as no other man did, he ought, logically speaking, to accept the\r\nworks of those who, in His name, had cast out devils, as demonstrating\r\na proportionate goodness on their part.  But it is people of this\r\nclass who are consigned to ever-lasting fire prepared for the devil\r\nand his angels.  Such zeal as that of Mr. Mozley for miracles tends, I\r\nfear, to eat his religion up.  The logical threatens to stifles the\r\nspiritual.  The truly religious soul needs no miraculous proof of the\r\ngoodness of Christ. The words addressed to Matthew at the receipt of\r\ncustom required no miracle to produce obedience.  It was by no stroke\r\nof the supernatural that Jesus caused those sent to seize Him to go\r\nbackward and fall to the ground.  It was the sublime and holy\r\neffluence from within, which needed no prodigy to commend it to the\r\nreverence even of his foes.\r\n\r\nAs regards the function of miracles in the founding of a religion, Mr.\r\nMozley institutes a comparison between the religion of Christ and that\r\nof Mahomet; and he derides the latter as 'irrational' because it does\r\nnot profess to adduce miracles in proof of its supernatural origin.\r\nBut the religion of Mahomet, notwithstanding this drawback, has\r\nthriven in the world, and at one time it held sway over larger\r\npopulations than Christianity itself.  The spread and influence of\r\nChristianity are, however, brought forward by Mr. Mozley as 'a\r\npermanent, enormous, and incalculable practical result' of Christian\r\nmiracles; and he makes use of this result to strengthen his plea for\r\nthe miraculous.  His logical warrant for this proceeding is not clear.\r\nIt is the method of science, when a phenomenon presents itself,\r\ntowards the production of which several elements may contribute, to\r\nexclude them one by one, so as to arrive at length at the truly\r\neffective cause.  Heat, for example, is associated with a phenomenon;\r\nwe exclude heat, but the phenomenon remains: hence, heat is not its\r\ncause.  Magnetism is associated with a phenomenon; we exclude\r\nmagnetism, but the phenomenon remains: hence, magnetism is not its\r\ncause.  Thus, also, when we seek the cause of a diffusion of a\r\nreligion--whether it be due to miracles, or to the spiritual force of\r\nits founders--we exclude the miracles, and, finding the result\r\nunchanged, we infer that miracles are not the effective cause.  This\r\nimportant experiment Mahometanism has made for us.  It has lived and\r\nspread without miracles; and to assert, in the face of this, that\r\nChristianity has spread _because_ of miracles, is, I submit, opposed\r\nboth to the spirit of science and the common sense of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe incongruity of inferring moral goodness from miraculous power has\r\nbeen dwelt upon above; in another particular also the strain put by\r\nMr. Mozley upon miracles is, I think, more than they can bear.  In\r\nconsistency with his principles, it is difficult to see how he is to\r\ndraw from the miracles of Christ any certain conclusion as to His\r\nDivine nature.  He dwells very forcibly on what he calls 'the\r\nargument from experience,' in the demolition of which he takes obvious\r\ndelight.  He destroys the argument, and repeats it, for the mere\r\nPleasure of again and again knocking the breath out of it. Experience,\r\nhe urges, can only deal with the past; and the moment we attempt to\r\nproject experience a hair's-breadth beyond the point it has at any\r\nmoment reached, we are condemned by reason.  It appears to me that\r\nwhen he infers from Christ's miracles a Divine and altogether\r\nsuperhuman energy, Mr. Mozley places himself precisely under this\r\ncondemnation.  For what is his logical ground for concluding that the\r\nmiracles of the New Testament illustrate Divine power?  May they not\r\nbe the result of expanded human power?  A miracle he defines as\r\nsomething impossible to man.  But how does he know that the miracles\r\nof the New Testament are impossible to man?  Seek as he may, he has\r\nabsolutely no reason to adduce save this--that man has never hitherto\r\naccomplished such things.  But does the fact that man _has_ never raised\r\nthe dead prove that he _can_ never raise the dead?  'Assuredly not,'\r\nmust be Mr. Mozley's reply; 'for this would be pushing experience\r\nbeyond the limit it has now reached--which I pronounce unlawful.' Then\r\na period may come when man will be able to raise the dead.  If this be\r\nconceded--and I do not see how Mr. Mozley can avoid the concession--it\r\ndestroys the necessity of inferring Christ's Divinity from His\r\nmiracles.  He, it may be contended, antedated the humanity of the\r\nfuture; as a mighty tidal wave leaves high upon the beach a mark which\r\nby-and-by becomes the general level of the ocean.  Turn the matter as\r\nyou will, no other warrant will be found for the all-important\r\nconclusion that Christ's miracles demonstrate Divine power, than an\r\nargument which has been stigmatised by Mr. Mozley as a 'rope of\r\nsand'--the argument from experience.\r\n\r\nThe learned Bampton Lecturer would be in this position, even had he\r\nseen with his own eyes every miracle recorded in the New Testament.\r\nBut he has, not seen these miracles; and his intellectual plight is\r\ntherefore worse.  He accepts these miracles on testimony.  Why does he\r\nbelieve that testimony?  How does he know that it is not delusion; how\r\nis he sure that it is not even fraud?  He will answer, that the\r\nwriting bears the marks of sobriety and truth; and that in many cases\r\nthe bearers of this message to mankind sealed it with their blood.\r\nGranted with all my heart; but whence the value of all this?  Is it\r\nnot solely derived from the fact that men, _as we know them_, do not\r\nsacrifice their lives in the attestation of that which they know to be\r\nuntrue?  Does not the entire value of the testimony of the Apostles\r\ndepend ultimately upon our experience of human nature?  It appears,\r\nthen, that those said to have seen the miracles, based their\r\ninferences from what they saw on the argument from experience; and\r\nthat Mr. Mozley bases his belief in their testimony on the same\r\nargument.  The weakness of his conclusion is quadrupled by this double\r\ninsertion of a principle of belief, to which he flatly denies\r\nrationality.  His reasoning, in fact, cuts two ways--if it destroys\r\nour trust in the order of nature, it far more effectually abolishes\r\nthe basis on which Mr. Mozley seeks to found the Christian religion.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nOver this argument from experience, which at bottom is _his_ argument,\r\nMr. Mozley rides rough-shod.  There is a dash of scorn in the energy\r\nwith which he tramples on it.  Probably some previous writer had made\r\ntoo much of it, and thus invited his powerful assault.  Finding the\r\ndifficulty of belief in miracles to rise from their being in\r\ncontradiction to the order of nature, he sets himself to examine the\r\ngrounds of our belief in that order.  With a vigour of logic rarely\r\nequalled, and with a confidence in its conclusions never surpassed, he\r\ndisposes of this belief in a manner calculated to startle those who,\r\nwithout due examination, had come to the conclusion that the order of\r\nnature was secure.  What we mean, he says, by our belief in the order\r\nof nature, is the belief that the future will be like the past. There\r\nis not, according to Mr. Mozley, the slightest rational basis for this\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nThat any cause in nature is more permanent than its existing and known\r\neffects, extending further, and about to produce other and more\r\ninstances besides what it has produced already, we have no evidence.\r\nLet us imagine,' he continues, 'the occurrence of a particular\r\nphysical phenomenon for the first time.  Upon that single occurrence\r\nwe should have but the very faintest expectation of another.  If it\r\ndid occur again, once or twice, so far from counting on another\r\noccurrence, a cessation would occur as the most natural event to us.\r\nBut let it continue one hundred times, and we should find no\r\nhesitation in inviting persons from a distance to see it; and if it\r\noccurred every day for years, its occurrence would be a certainty to\r\nus, its cessation a marvel... What ground of reason can we assign for\r\nan expectation that any part of the course of nature will be the next\r\nmoment what it has been up to this moment, i.e. for our belief in the\r\nuniformity of nature?  None.  No demonstrative reason can be given,\r\nfor the contrary to the recurrence of a fact of nature is no\r\ncontradiction.  No probable reason can be given; for all probable\r\nreasoning respecting the course of nature is founded _upon_ this\r\npresumption of likeness, and therefore cannot be the foundation of it.\r\nNo reason can be given for this belief.  It is without a reason.  It\r\nrests upon no rational grounds, and can be traced to no rational\r\nprinciple.'\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n'Everything,' Mr. Mozley, however, adds, 'depends upon this belief,\r\nevery provision we make for the future, every safeguard and caution we\r\nemploy against it, all calculation, all adjustment of means to ends,\r\nsupposes this belief; and yet this belief has no more producible\r\nreason for it than a speculation of fancy.  It is necessary,\r\nall-important for the purposes of life, but solely practical, and\r\npossesses no intellectual character.\r\n\r\n'... The proper function,' continues Mr. Mozley, 'of the inductive\r\nprinciple, the argument from experience, the belief in the order of\r\nnature--by whatever phrase we designate the same instinct--is to\r\noperate as a practical basis for the affairs of life and the carrying\r\non of human society.' To sum up, the belief in the order of nature is\r\ngeneral, but it is 'an unintelligent impulse, of which we can give no\r\nrational account.' It is inserted into our constitution solely to\r\ninduce us to till our fields, to raise our winter fuel, and thus to\r\nmeet the future on the perfectly gratuitous supposition that it will\r\nbe like the past.\r\n\r\n'Thus, step by step,' says Mr. Mozley, with the emphasis of a man who\r\nfeels his position to be a strong one, 'has philosophy loosened the\r\nconnection of the order of nature with the ground of reason,\r\nbefriending in exact proportion as it has done this the principle of\r\nmiracles.' For 'this belief not having itself a foundation in reason,\r\nthe ground is gone upon which it could be maintained that miracles, as\r\nopposed to the order of nature, are opposed to reason.' When we regard\r\nthis belief in connection with science, 'in which connection it\r\nreceives a more imposing name, and is called the inductive principle,'\r\nthe result is the same.  'The inductive principle is only this\r\nunreasoning impulse applied to a scientifically ascertained fact...\r\nScience has led up to the fact; but there it stops, and for converting\r\nthis fact into a law, a totally unscientific principle comes into\r\nplay, the same as that which generalises the commonest observation of\r\nnature.'\r\n\r\nThe eloquent pleader of the cause of miracles passes over without a\r\nword the _results_ of scientific investigation, as proving anything\r\nrational regarding the principles or method by which such results have\r\nbeen achieved.  Here, as elsewhere, he declines the test, 'By their\r\nfruits shall ye know them.' Perhaps our best way of proceeding will be\r\nto give one or two examples of the mode in which men of science apply\r\nthe unintelligent impulse with which Mr. Mozley credits them, and\r\nwhich shall show, by illustration, the surreptitious method whereby\r\nthey climb from the region of facts to that of laws.\r\n\r\nBefore the sixteenth century it was known that water rises in a pump;\r\nthe effect being then explained by the maxim that 'Nature abhors a\r\nvacuum.' It was not known that there was any limit to the height to\r\nwhich the water would ascend, until, on one occasion, the gardeners of\r\nFlorence, while attempting to raise water to a very great elevation,\r\nfound that the column ceased at a height of thirty-two feet.  Beyond\r\nthis all the skill of the pump-maker could not get it to rise.  The\r\nfact was brought to the notice of Galileo, and he, soured by a world\r\nwhich had not treated his science over kindly, is said to have twitted\r\nthe philosophy of the time by remarking that nature evidently abhorred\r\na vacuum only to a height of thirty-two feet.  Galileo, however, did\r\nnot solve the problem.  It was taken up by his pupil Torricelli, to\r\nwhom, after due pondering, the thought occurred, that the water might\r\nbe forced into the tube by a pressure applied to the surface of the\r\nliquid outside.  But where, under the actual circumstances, was such a\r\npressure to be found?  After much reflection, it flashed upon\r\nTorricelli that the atmosphere might possibly exert this pressure;\r\nthat the impalpable air might possess weight, and that a column of\r\nwater thirty-two feet high might be of the exact weight necessary to\r\nhold the pressure of the atmosphere in equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThere is much in this process of pondering and its results which it is\r\nimpossible to analyse.  It is by a kind of inspiration that we rise\r\nfrom the wise and sedulous contemplation of facts to the principles on\r\nwhich they depend.  The mind is, as it were, a photographic plate,\r\nwhich is gradually cleansed by the effort to think rightly, and which,\r\nwhen so cleansed, and not before, receives impressions from the light\r\nof truth.  This passage from 'facts to principles is called induction;\r\nand induction, in its highest form, is, as I have just stated, a kind\r\nof inspiration.  But, to make it sure, the inward sight must be shown\r\nto be in accordance with outward fact.  To prove or disprove the\r\ninduction, we must resort to deduction and experiment.\r\n\r\nTorricelli reasoned thus: If a column of water thirty-two feet high\r\nholds the pressure of the atmosphere in equilibrium, a shorter column\r\nof a heavier liquid ought to do the same.  Now, mercury is thirteen\r\ntimes heavier than water; hence, if my induction be correct, the\r\natmosphere ought to be able to sustain only thirty inches of mercury.\r\nHere, then, is a deduction which can be immediately submitted to\r\nexperiment. Torricelli took a glass tube a yard or so in length,\r\nclosed at one end and open at the other, and filling it with mercury,\r\nhe stopped the open end with his thumb, and inverted it into a basin\r\nfilled with the liquid metal.  One can imagine the feeling with which\r\nTorricelli removed his thumb, and the delight he experienced on\r\nfinding that his thought had forestalled a fact never before revealed\r\nto human eyes.  The column sank, but it ceased to sink at a height of\r\nthirty inches, leaving the Torricellian vacuum over-head.  From that\r\nhour the theory of the pump was established.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Pascal followed Torricelli with another deduction.  He\r\nreasoned thus: If the mercurial column be supported by the atmosphere,\r\nthe higher we ascend in the air, the lower the column ought to sink,\r\nfor the less will be the weight of the air overhead.  He caused a\r\nfriend to ascend the Puy de Dôme, carrying with him a barometric\r\ncolumn; and it was found that during the ascent the column sank, and\r\nthat during the subsequent descent the column rose.\r\n\r\nBetween the time here referred to and the present, millions of\r\nexperiments have been made upon this subject.  Every village pump is\r\nan apparatus for such experiments.  In thousands of instances,\r\nmoreover, pumps have refused to work; but on examination it has\r\ninfallibly been found that the well was dry, that the pump required\r\npriming, or that some other defect in the apparatus accounted for the\r\nanomalous action.  In every case of the kind the skill of the\r\npump-maker has been found to be the true remedy.  In no case has the\r\npressure of the atmosphere ceased; constancy, as regards the lifting\r\nof pump-water, has been hitherto the demonstrated rule of nature.  So\r\nalso as regards Pascal's experiment.  His experience has been the\r\nuniversal experience ever since.  Men have climbed mountains, and gone\r\nup in balloons; but no deviation from Pascal's result has ever been\r\nobserved.  Barometers, like pumps, have refused to act; but instead of\r\nindicating any suspension of the operations of nature, or any\r\ninterference on the part of its Author with atmospheric pressure,\r\nexamination has in every instance fixed the anomaly upon the\r\ninstruments themselves.  It is this welding, then, of rigid logic to\r\nverifying fact that Mr. Mozley refers to an 'unreasoning impulse.'\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly consider the case of Newton.  Before his time men\r\nhad occupied themselves with the problem of the solar system.  Kepler\r\nhad deduced, from a vast mass of observations, those general\r\nexpressions of planetary motion known as 'Kepler's laws.' It had been\r\nobserved that a magnet attracts iron; and by one of those flashes of\r\ninspiration which reveal to the human mind the vast in the minute, the\r\ngeneral in the particular, it had been inferred, that the force by\r\nwhich bodies fall to the earth might also be an attraction.  Newton\r\npondered all these things.  He looked, as was his wont, into the\r\ndarkness until it became entirely luminous.  How this light arises we\r\ncannot explain; but, as a matter of fact, it does arise.  Let me\r\nremark here, that this kind of pondering is a process with which the\r\nancients could have been but imperfectly acquainted.  They, for the\r\nmost part, found the exercise of fantasy more pleasant than careful\r\nobservation, and subsequent brooding over facts.  Hence it is, that\r\nwhen those whose education has been derived from the ancients speak of\r\n'the reason of man,' they are apt to omit from their conception of\r\nreason one of its most important factors.\r\n\r\nWell, Newton slowly marshalled his thoughts, or rather they came to\r\nhim while he 'intended his mind,' rising like a series of\r\nintellectual births out of chaos.  He made this idea of attraction his\r\nown.  But, to apply the idea to the solar system, it was necessary to\r\nknow the magnitude of the attraction, and the law of its variation\r\nwith the distance.  His conceptions first of all passed from the\r\naction of the earth as a whole, to that of its constituent particles.\r\nAnd persistent thought brought more and more clearly out the final\r\nconclusion, that every particle of matter attracts every other\r\nparticle with a force varying inversely as the square of the distance\r\nbetween the particles.\r\n\r\nHere we have the flower and outcome of Newton's induction; and how to\r\nverify it, or to disprove it, was the next question.  The first step\r\nof the philosopher in this direction was to prove, mathematically,\r\nthat if this law of attraction be the true one; if the earth be\r\nconstituted of particles which obey this law; then the action of a\r\nsphere equal to the earth in size on a body outside of it, is the same\r\nas that which would be exerted if the whole mass of the sphere were\r\ncontracted to a point at its centre.  Practically speaking, then, the\r\ncentre of the earth is the point from which distances must be measured\r\nto bodies attracted by the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments executed before his time, Newton knew the amount of\r\nthe earth's attraction at the earth's surface, or at a distance of\r\n4,000 miles from its centre.  His object now was to measure the\r\nattraction at a greater distance, and thus to determine the law of its\r\ndiminution.  But how was he to find a body at a sufficient distance?\r\nHe had no balloon?  and even if he had, he knew that any height to\r\nwhich he could attain would be too small to enable him to solve his\r\nproblem.  What did he do?  He fixed his thoughts upon the moon;--a\r\nbody 240,000 miles, or sixty times the earth's radius, from the\r\nearth's centre.  He virtually weighed the moon, and found that weight\r\nto be 1/3600th of what it would be at the earth's surface.  This is\r\nexactly what his theory required.  I will not dwell here upon the\r\npause of Newton after his first calculations, or speak of his\r\nself-denial in withholding them because they did not quite agree with\r\nthe observations then at his command.  Newton's action in this matter\r\nis the normal action of the scientific mind.  If it were otherwise--if\r\nscientific men were not accustomed to demand verification--if they\r\nwere satisfied with the imperfect while the perfect is attainable,\r\ntheir science, instead of being, as it is, a fortress of adamant,\r\nwould be a house of clay, ill-fitted to bear the buffetings of the\r\ntheologic storms to which it is periodically exposed.\r\n\r\nThus we see that Newton, like Torricelli, first pondered his facts,\r\nilluminated them with persistent thought, and finally divined the\r\ncharacter of the force of gravitation.  But, having thus travelled\r\ninward to the principle, he reversed his steps, carried the principle\r\noutwards, and justified it by demonstrating its fitness to external\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAnd here, in passing, I would notice a point which is well worthy of\r\nattention.  Kepler had deduced his laws from observation.  As far back\r\nas those observations extended, the planetary motions had obeyed these\r\nlaws; and neither Kepler nor Newton entertained a doubt as to their\r\ncontinuing to obey them.  Year after year, as the ages rolled, they\r\nbelieved that those laws would continue to illustrate themselves in\r\nthe heavens.  But this was not sufficient.  The scientific mind can\r\nfind no repose in the mere registration of sequence in nature.  The\r\nfurther question intrudes itself with resistless might, Whence comes\r\nthe sequence?  What is it that binds the consequent to its antecedent\r\nin nature?  The truly scientific intellect never can attain rest until\r\nit reaches the _forces_ by which the observed succession is produced. It\r\nwas thus with Torricelli; it was thus with Newton; it is thus\r\npre-eminently with the scientific man of to-day.  In common with the\r\nmost ignorant, he shares the belief that spring will succeed winter,\r\nthat summer will succeed spring, that autumn will succeed summer, and\r\nthat winter will succeed autumn.  But he knows still further--and this\r\nknowledge is essential to his intellectual repose--that this\r\nsuccession, besides being permanent, is, under the circumstances,\r\n_necessary_; that the gravitating force exerted between the sun and a\r\nrevolving sphere with an axis inclined to the plane of its orbit, must\r\nproduce the observed succession of the seasons.  Not until this\r\nrelation between forces and phenomena has been established, is the law\r\nof reason rendered concentric with the law of nature; and not until\r\nthis is effected does the mind of the scientific philosopher rest in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe expectation of likeness, then, in the procession of phenomena, is\r\nnot that on which the scientific mind founds its belief in the order\r\nof nature.  If the force be _permanent_ the phenomena are _necessary_,\r\nwhether they resemble or do not resemble anything that has gone\r\nbefore.  Hence, in judging of the order of nature, our enquiries\r\neventually relate to the permanence of force.  From Galileo to Newton,\r\nfrom Newton to our own time, eager eyes have been scanning the\r\nheavens, and clear heads have been pondering the phenomena of the\r\nsolar system.  The same eyes and minds have been also observing,\r\nexperimenting, and reflecting on the action of gravity at the surface\r\nof the earth.  Nothing has occurred to indicate that the operation of\r\nthe law has for a moment been suspended; nothing has ever intimated\r\nthat nature has been crossed by spontaneous action, or that a state of\r\nthings at any time existed which could not be rigorously deduced from\r\nthe preceding state.\r\n\r\nGiven the distribution of matter, and the forces in operation, in the\r\ntime of Galileo, the competent mathematician of that day could predict\r\nwhat is now occurring in our own.  We calculate eclipses in advance,\r\nand find our calculations true to the second.  We determine the dates\r\nof those that have occurred in the early times of history, and find\r\ncalculation and history in harmony.  Anomalies and perturbations in\r\nthe planets have been over and over again observed; but these, instead\r\nof demonstrating any inconstancy on the part of natural law, have\r\ninvariably been reduced to consequences of that law.  Instead of\r\nreferring the perturbations of Uranus to any interference on the part\r\nof the Author of nature with the law of gravitation, the question\r\nwhich the astronomer proposed to himself was, 'How, in accordance with\r\nthis law, can the perturbation be produced?' Guided by a principle, he\r\nwas enabled to fix the point of space in which, if a mass of matter\r\nwere placed, the observed perturbations would follow.  We know the\r\nresult.  The practical astronomer turned his telescope towards the\r\nregion which the intellect of the theoretic astronomer had already\r\nexplored, and the Planet now named Neptune was found in its predicted\r\nPlace.  A very respectable outcome, it will be admitted, of an impulse\r\nwhich 'rests upon no rational grounds, and can be traced to no\r\nrational principle;' which possesses 'no intellectual character;'\r\nwhich 'philosophy' has uprooted from 'the ground of reason,' and fixed\r\nin that 'large irrational department' discovered for it, by Mr.\r\nMozley, in the hitherto unexplored wilderness of the human mind.\r\n\r\nThe proper function of the inductive principle, or the belief in the\r\norder of nature, says Mr. Mozley, is 'to act as a practical basis for\r\nthe affairs of life, and the carrying on of human society.' But what,\r\nit may be asked, has the planet Neptune, or the belts of Jupiter, or\r\nthe whiteness about the poles of Mars, to do with the affairs of\r\nsociety?  How is society affected by the fact that the sun's\r\natmosphere contains sodium, or that the nebula of Orion contains\r\nhydrogen gas?  Nineteen-twentieths of the force employed in the\r\nexercise of the inductive principle, which, reiterates Mr. Mozley, is\r\n'purely practical,' have been expended upon subjects as unpractical as\r\nthese.  What practical interest has society in the fact that the spots\r\non the sun have a decennial period, and that when a magnet is closely\r\nwatched for half a century, it is found to perform small motions which\r\nsynchronise with the appearance and disappearance of the solar spots?\r\nAnd yet, I doubt not, Sir Edward Sabine would deem a life of\r\nintellectual toil amply rewarded by being privileged to solve, at its\r\nclose, these infinitesimal motions.  The inductive principle is\r\nfounded in man's desire to know--a desire arising from his position\r\namong phenomena which are reducible to order by his intellect: The\r\nmaterial universe is the complement of the intellect; and, without the\r\nstudy of its laws, reason could never have awakened to the higher\r\nforms of self-consciousness at all.  It is the Non-ego through and by\r\nwhich the Ego is endowed with self-discernment. We hold it to be an\r\nexercise of reason to explore the meaning of a universe to which we\r\nstand in this relation, and the work we have accomplished is the\r\nproper commentary on the methods we have pursued.\r\n\r\nBefore these methods were adopted the unbridled imagination roamed\r\nthrough nature, putting in the place of law the figments of\r\nsuperstitious dread.  For thousands of years witchcraft, and magic,\r\nand miracles, and special providences, and Mr. Mozley's 'distinctive\r\nreason of man,' had the world to themselves.  They made worse than\r\nnothing of it--_worse_, I say, because they let and hindered those who\r\nmight have made something of it.  Hence it is, that during a single\r\nlifetime of this era of 'unintelligent impulse,' the progress in\r\nknowledge is all but infinite as compared with that of the ages which\r\npreceded ours.\r\n\r\nThe believers in magic and miracles of a couple of centuries ago had\r\nall the strength of Mr. Mozley's present logic on their side.  They\r\nhad done for themselves what he rejoices in having so effectually done\r\nfor us--cleared the ground of the belief in the order of nature, and\r\ndeclared magic, miracles, and witchcraft to be matters for 'ordinary\r\nevidence' to decide.  'The principle of miracles' thus 'befriended'\r\nhad free scope, and we know the result.  Lacking that rock-barrier of\r\nnatural knowledge which we now possess, keen jurists and cultivated\r\nmen were hurried on to deeds, the bare recital of which makes the\r\nblood run cold.  Skilled in all the rules of human evidence, and\r\nversed in all the arts of cross-examination, these men, nevertheless,\r\nwent systematically astray, and committed the deadliest wrongs against\r\nhumanity.  And why?  Because they could not put Nature into the\r\nwitness-box, and question her--of her voiceless 'testimony' they knew\r\nnothing.  In all cases between man and man, their judgment was to be\r\nrelied on; but in all cases between man and nature, they were blind\r\nleaders of the blind. [Footnote: 'In 1664 two women were hung in\r\nSuffolk, under a sentence of Sir Matthew Hale, who took the\r\nopportunity of declaring that the reality of witchcraft was\r\nunquestionable; \"for first, the Scriptures had affirmed so much; and\r\nsecondly, the wisdom of all nations had provided laws against such\r\npersons, which is an argument of their confidence of such a crime.\"\r\nSir Thomas Browne, who was a great physician as well as a great\r\nwriter, was called as a witness, and swore \"that he was clearly of\r\nopinion that the persons were bewitched.\"--Lecky's History of\r\nRationalism, vol. i. p. 120.]\r\n\r\nMr. Mozley concedes that it would be no great result if miracles were\r\nonly accepted by the ignorant and superstitious, 'because it is easy\r\nto satisfy those who do not enquire.'  But he does consider it 'a\r\ngreat result' that they have been accepted by the educated.  In what\r\nsense educated?  Like those statesmen, jurists, and church dignitaries\r\nwhose education was unable to save them from the frightful errors\r\nglanced at above?  Not even in this sense; for the great mass of Mr.\r\nMozley's educated people had no legal training, and must have been\r\nabsolutely defenceless against delusions which could set even that\r\ntraining at naught.  Like nine-tenths of our clergy at the present\r\nday, they were versed in the literature of Greece, Rome, and Judea;\r\nbut as regards a knowledge of nature, which is here the one thing\r\nneedful, they were 'noble savages,' and nothing more.  In the case of\r\nmiracles, then, it behoves us to understand the weight of the\r\nnegative, before we assign a value to the positive; to comprehend the\r\ndepositions of nature, before we attempt to measure, with them, the\r\nevidence of men.  We have only to open our eyes to see what honest and\r\neven intellectual men and women are capable of, as to judging\r\nevidence, in this nineteenth century of the Christian era, and in\r\nlatitude fifty-two degrees north.  The experience thus gained ought, I\r\nimagine, to influence our opinion regarding the testimony of people\r\ninhabiting a sunnier clime, with a richer imagination, and without a\r\nparticle of that restraint which the discoveries of physical science\r\nhave imposed upon mankind.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHaving thus submitted Mr. Mozley's views to the examination which they\r\nchallenged at the hands of a student of nature, I am unwilling to quit\r\nhis book without expressing my admiration of his genius, and my\r\nrespect for his character.  Though barely known to him personally, his\r\nrecent death affected me as that of a friend.  With regard to the\r\nstyle of his book, I heartily subscribe to the description with which\r\nthe 'Times' winds up its able and appreciative review.  It is marked\r\nthroughout with the most serious and earnest conviction, but is\r\nwithout a single word from first to last of asperity or insinuation\r\nagainst opponents; and this not from any deficiency of feeling as to\r\nthe importance of the issue, but from a deliberate and resolutely\r\nmaintained self-control, and from an over-ruling, ever-present sense\r\nof the duty, on themes like these, of a more than judicial calmness.'\r\n\r\n[To the argument regarding the quantity of the miraculous, introduced\r\nat page 17, Mr. Mozley has done me the honour of publishing a Reply in\r\nthe seventh volume of the 'Contemporary Review.'--J.  T.]\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL REMARKS ON MIRACLES.\r\n\r\nAMONG the scraps of manuscript, written at the time when Mr. Mozley's\r\nwork occupied my attention, I find the following reflections:\r\n\r\nWith regard to the influence of modern science which Mr. Mozley rates\r\nso low, one obvious effect of it is to enhance the magnitude of many\r\nof the recorded miracles, and to increase proportionably the\r\ndifficulties of belief.  The ancients knew but little of the vastness\r\nof the universe.  The Rev. Mr. Kirkman, for example, has shown what\r\ninadequate notions the Jews entertained regarding the 'firmament of\r\nheaven;' and Sir George Airy refers to the case of a Greek philosopher\r\nwho was persecuted for hazarding the assertion, then deemed monstrous,\r\nthat the sun might be as large as the whole country of Greece.  The\r\nconcerns of a universe, regarded from this point of view, were much\r\nmore commensurate with man and his concerns than those of the universe\r\nwhich science now reveals to us; and hence that to suit man's\r\npurposes, or that in compliance with his prayers, changes should occur\r\nin the order of the universe, was more easy of belief in the ancient\r\nworld than it can be now.  In the very magnitude which it assigns to\r\nnatural phenomena, science has augmented the distance between them and\r\nman, and increased the popular belief in their orderly progression.\r\n\r\nAs a natural consequence the demand for evidence is more exacting than\r\nit used to be, whenever it is affirmed that the order of nature has\r\nbeen disturbed.  Let us take as an illustration the miracle by which\r\nthe victory of Joshua over the Amorites was rendered complete.  In\r\nthis case the sun is reported to have stood still for 'about a whole\r\nday' upon Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon.  An Englishman\r\nof average education at the present day would naturally demand a\r\ngreater amount of evidence to prove that this occurrence took place,\r\nthan would have satisfied an Israelite in the age succeeding that of\r\nJoshua.  For to the one, the miracle probably consisted in the\r\nstoppage of a fiery ball less than a yard in diameter, while to the\r\nother it would be the stoppage of an orb fourteen hundred thousand\r\ntimes the earth in size.  And even accepting the interpretation that\r\nJoshua dealt with what was apparent merely, but that what really\r\noccurred was the suspension of the earth's rotation, I think the right\r\nto exercise a greater reserve in accepting the miracle, and to demand\r\nstronger evidence in support of it than that which would have\r\nsatisfied an ancient Israelite, will still be conceded to a man of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThere is a scientific as well as an historic imagination; and when, by\r\nthe exercise of the former, the stoppage of the earth's rotation is\r\nclearly realised, the event assumes proportions so vast, in comparison\r\nwith the result to be obtained by it, that belief reels under the\r\nreflection.  The energy here involved is equal to that of six\r\ntrillions of horses working for the whole of the time employed by\r\nJoshua in the destruction of his foes.  The amount of power thus\r\nexpended would be sufficient to supply every individual of an army a\r\nthousand times the strength of that of Joshua, with a thousand times\r\nthe fighting power of each of Joshua's soldiers, not for the few hours\r\nnecessary to the extinction of a handful of Amorites, but for millions\r\nof years.  All this wonder is silently passed over by the sacred\r\nhistorian, manifestly because he knew nothing about it.  Whether,\r\ntherefore, we consider the miracle as purely evidential, or as a\r\npractical means of vengeance, the same lavish squandering of energy\r\nstares us in the face.  If evidential, the energy was wasted, because\r\nthe Israelites knew nothing of its amount; if simply destructive, then\r\nthe ratio of the quantity lost to the quantity employed, may be\r\ninferred from the foregoing figures.\r\n\r\nTo other miracles similar remarks apply.  Transferring our thoughts\r\nfrom this little sand-grain of an earth to the immeasurable heavens,\r\nwhere countless worlds with freights of life probably revolve unseen,\r\nthe very suns which warm them being barely visible across abysmal\r\nspace; reflecting that beyond these sparks of solar fire, suns\r\ninnumerable may burn, whose light can never stir the optic nerve at\r\nall; and bringing these reflections face to face with the idea of the\r\nBuilder and Sustainer of it all showing Himself in a burning bush,\r\nexhibiting His hinder parts, or behaving in other familiar ways\r\nascribed to Him in the Jewish Scriptures, the incongruity must appear.\r\nDid this credulous prattle of the ancients about miracles stand alone;\r\nwere it not associated with words of imperishable wisdom, and with\r\nexamples of moral grandeur unmatched elsewhere in the history of the\r\nhuman race, both the miracles and their 'evidences' would have long\r\nsince ceased to be the transmitted inheritance of intelligent men.\r\nInfluenced by the thoughts which this universe inspires, well may we\r\nexclaim in David's spirit, if not in David's words: 'When I consider\r\nthe heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon, and the stars, which\r\nthou hast ordained; what is man that thou shouldst be mindful of him,\r\nor the son of man that thou shouldst so regard him?'\r\n\r\nIf you ask me who is to limit the outgoings of Almighty power, my\r\nanswer is, Not I.  If you should urge that if the Builder and Maker of\r\nthis universe chose to stop the rotation of the earth, or to take the\r\nform of a burning bush, there is nothing to prevent Him from doing so,\r\nI am not prepared to contradict you.  I neither agree with you nor\r\ndiffer from you, for it is a subject of which I know nothing.  But I\r\nobserve that in such questions regarding Almighty power, your\r\nenquiries relate, not to that power as it is actually displayed in the\r\nuniverse, but to the power of your own imagination.  Your question is,\r\nnot has the Omnipotent done so and so?  or is it in the least degree\r\nlikely that the Omnipotent should do so and so?  but, is my\r\nimagination competent to picture a Being able and willing to do so and\r\nso?  I am not prepared to deny your competence.  To the human mind\r\nbelongs the faculty of enlarging and diminishing, of distorting and\r\ncombining, indefinitely the objects revealed by the senses.  It can\r\nimagine a mouse as large as an elephant, an elephant as large as a\r\nmountain, and a mountain as high as the stars.  It can separate\r\ncongruities and unite incongruities.  We see a fish and we see a woman\r\nwe can drop one half of each, and unite in idea the other two halves\r\nto a mermaid.  We see a horse and we see a man; we are able to drop\r\none half of each, and unite the other two halves to a centaur.  Thus\r\nalso the pictorial representations of the Deity, the bodies and wings\r\nof cherubs and seraphs, the hoofs, horns, and tail of the Evil One,\r\nthe joys of the blessed, and the torments of the damned, have been\r\nelaborated from materials furnished to the imagination by the senses.\r\nIt behoves you and me to take care that our notions of the Power which\r\nrules the universe are not mere fanciful or ignorant enlargements of\r\nhuman power.  The capabilities of what you call your reason are not\r\ndenied.  By the exercise of the faculty here adverted to, you can\r\npicture to yourself a Being able and willing to do any and every\r\nconceivable thing.  You are right in saying that in opposition to this\r\nPower science is of no avail--that it is 'a weapon of air.' The man of\r\nscience, however, while accepting the figure, would probably reverse\r\nits application, thinking it is not science which is here the thing of\r\nair, but that unsubstantial pageant of the imagination to which the\r\nsolidity of science is opposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n        Prayer as a means to effect a private end is theft and\r\n        meanness.--EMERSON.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nIII  ON PRAYER AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL ENERGY.\r\n\r\nTHE Editor of the 'Contemporary Review' is liberal enough to grant me\r\nspace for some remarks upon a subject, which, though my relation to it\r\nwas simply that of a vehicle of transmission, has brought down upon me\r\na considerable amount of animadversion.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to some of my readers if I glance at a few cases\r\nillustrative of the history of the human mind, in relation to this and\r\nkindred questions.  In the fourth century the belief in Antipodes was\r\ndeemed unscriptural and heretical.  The pious Lactantius was as angry\r\nwith the people who held this notion as my censors are now with me,\r\nand quite as unsparing in his denunciations of their 'Monstrosities.'\r\nLactantius was irritated because, in his mind, by education and habit,\r\ncosmogony and religion were indissolubly associated, and, therefore,\r\nsimultaneously disturbed.  In the early part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury the notion that the earth was fixed, and that the sun and\r\nstars revolved round it daily, was interwoven with religious feeling,\r\nthe separation then attempted by Galileo rousing the animosity and\r\nkindling the persecution of the Church.  Men still living can remember\r\nthe indignation excited by the first revelations of geology regarding\r\nthe age of the earth, the association between chronology and religion\r\nbeing for the time indissoluble.  In our day, however, the\r\nbest-informed theologians are prepared to admit that our views of the\r\nUniverse and its Author are not impaired, but improved, by the\r\nabandonment of the Mosaic account of the Creation. Look, finally, at\r\nthe excitement caused by the publication of the 'Origin of Species;'\r\nand compare it with the calm attendant on the appearance of the far\r\nmore outspoken, and, from the old point of view, more impious,\r\n'Descent of Man.'\r\n\r\nThus religion survives-after the removal of what had been long\r\nconsidered essential to it.  In our day the Antipodes are accepted;\r\nthe fixity of the earth is given up; the period of Creation and the\r\nreputed age of the world are alike dissipated; Evolution is looked\r\nupon without terror; and other changes have occurred in the same\r\ndirection too numerous to be dwelt upon here.  In fact, from the\r\nearliest times to the present, religion has been undergoing a process\r\nof purification, freeing itself slowly and painfully from the physical\r\nerrors which the active but uninformed intellect mingled with the\r\naspirations of the soul.  Some of us think that a final act of\r\npurification is needed, while others oppose this notion with the\r\nconfidence and the warmth of ancient times.  The bone of contention at\r\npresent is _the physical value of prayer_.  It is not my wish to excite\r\nsurprise, much less to draw forth protest, by the employment of this\r\nphrase.  I would simply ask any intelligent person to look the problem\r\nhonestly in the face, and then to say whether, in the estimation of\r\nthe great body of those who sincerely resort to it, prayer does not,\r\nat all events upon special occasions, invoke a Power which checks and\r\naugments the descent of rain, which changes the force and direction of\r\nwinds, which affects the growth of corn and the health of men and\r\ncattle a Power, in short, which, when appealed to under pressing\r\ncircumstances, produces the precise effects caused by physical energy\r\nin the ordinary course of things.  To any person who deals sincerely\r\nwith the subject, and refuses to blur his moral vision by intellectual\r\nsubtleties, this, I think, will appear a true statement of the case.\r\n\r\nIt is under this aspect alone that the scientific student, so far as I\r\nrepresent him, has any wish to meddle with prayer.  Forced upon his\r\nattention as a form of physical energy, or as the equivalent of such\r\nenergy, he claims the right of subjecting it to those methods of\r\nexamination from which all our present knowledge of the physical\r\nuniverse is derived.  And if his researches lead him to a conclusion\r\nadverse to its claims--if his enquiries rivet him still closer to the\r\nphilosophy implied in the words, 'He maketh His sun to shine on the\r\nevil and on the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and upon the\r\nunjust'--he contends only for the displacement of prayer, not for its\r\nextinction.  He simply says, physical nature is not its legitimate\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion, moreover, must be based on pure physical evidence,\r\nand not on any inherent, unreasonableness in the act of prayer.  The\r\ntheory that the system of nature is under the control of a Being who\r\nchanges phenomena in compliance with the prayers of men, is, in my\r\nopinion, a perfectly legitimate one.  It may of course be rendered\r\nfutile by being associated `with conceptions which contradict it; but\r\nsuch conceptions form no necessary part of the theory.  It is a matter\r\nof experience that an earthly father, who is at the same time both\r\nwise and tender, listens to the requests of his children, and, if they\r\ndo not ask amiss, takes pleasure in granting their requests.  We know\r\nalso that this compliance extends to the alteration, within certain\r\nlimits, of the current of events on earth.  With this suggestion\r\noffered by experience, it is no departure from scientific method to\r\nplace behind natural phenomena a Universal Father, who, in answer to\r\nthe prayers of His children, alters the currents of those phenomena.\r\nThus far Theology and Science go hand in hand.  The conception of an\r\naether, for example, trembling with the waves of light, is suggested\r\nby the ordinary phenomena of wave-motion in water and in air; and in\r\nlike manner the conception of personal volition in nature is suggested\r\nby the ordinary action of man upon earth.  I therefore urge no\r\n_impossibilities_, though I am constantly charged with doing so.  I do\r\nnot even urge inconsistency, but, on the contrary, frankly admit that\r\nthe theologian has as good a right to place his conception at the root\r\nof phenomena as I have to place mine.\r\n\r\nBut without _verification_ a theoretic conception is a mere figment of\r\nthe intellect, and I am sorry to find us parting company at this\r\npoint.  The region of theory, both in science and theology, lies\r\nbehind the world of the senses, but the verification of theory occurs\r\nin the sensible world.  To check the theory we have simply to compare\r\nthe deductions from it with the facts of observation.  If the\r\ndeductions be in accordance with the facts, we accept the theory: if\r\nin opposition, the theory is given up.  A single experiment is\r\nfrequently devised, by which the theory must stand or fall.  Of this\r\ncharacter was the determination of the velocity of light in liquids,\r\nas a crucial test of the Emission Theory.  According to it, light\r\ntravelled faster in water than in air; according to the Undulatory\r\nTheory, it travelled faster in air than in water.  An experiment\r\nsuggested by Arago, and executed by Fizeau and Foucault, was\r\nconclusive against Newton's theory.\r\n\r\nBut while science cheerfully submits to this ordeal, it seems\r\nimpossible to devise a mode of verification of their theories which\r\ndoes not rouse resentment in theological minds.  Is it that, while the\r\npleasure of the scientific man culminates in the demonstrated harmony\r\nbetween theory and fact, the highest pleasure of the religious man has\r\nbeen already tasted in the very act of praying, prior to verification,\r\nany further effort in this direction being a mere disturbance of his\r\npeace?  Or is it that we have before us a residue of that mysticism of\r\nthe middle ages, so admirably described by Whewell--that 'practice of\r\nreferring things and events not to clear and distinct notions, not to\r\ngeneral rules capable of direct verification, but to notions vague,\r\ndistant, and vast, which we cannot bring into contact with facts; as\r\nwhen we connect natural events with moral and historic causes.'\r\n'Thus,' he continues, 'the character of mysticism is that it refers\r\nparticulars, not to generalisations, homogeneous and immediate, but to\r\nsuch as are heterogeneous and remote; to which we must add, that the\r\nprocess of this reference is not a calm act of the intellect, but is\r\naccompanied with a glow of enthusiastic feeling.'\r\n\r\nEvery feature here depicted, and some more questionable ones, have\r\nshown themselves of late; most conspicuously, I regret to say, in the\r\nleaders' of a weekly journal of considerable influence, and one, on\r\nmany grounds, entitled to the respect of thoughtful men.  In the\r\ncorrespondence, however, published by the same journal, are to be\r\nfound two or three letters well calculated to correct the temporary\r\nflightiness of the journal itself.\r\n\r\nIt is not my habit of mind to think otherwise than solemnly of the\r\nfeeling which prompts prayer.  It is a power which I should like to\r\nsee guided, not extinguished--devoted to practicable objects instead\r\nof wasted upon air.  In some form or other, not yet evident, it may,\r\nas alleged, be necessary to man's highest culture.  Certain it is\r\nthat, while I rank many persons who resort to prayer low in the scale\r\nof being--natural foolishness, bigotry, and intolerance being in their\r\ncase intensified by the notion that they have access to the ear of\r\nGod--I regard others who employ it, as forming part of the very cream\r\nof the earth.  The faith that adds to the folly and ferocity of the\r\none is turned to enduring sweetness, holiness, abounding charity, and\r\nself-sacrifice by the other.  Religion, in fact, varies with the\r\nnature upon which it falls.  Often unreasonable, if not contemptible,\r\nprayer, in its purer forms, hints at disciplines which few of us can\r\nneglect without moral loss.  But no good can come of giving it a\r\ndelusive value, by claiming for it a power in physical nature.  It may\r\nstrengthen the heart to meet life's losses, and thus indirectly\r\npromote physical well-being, as the digging of Aesop's orchard brought\r\na treasure of fertility greater than the golden treasure sought.  Such\r\nindirect issues we all admit; but it would be simply dishonest to\r\naffirm that it is such issues that are always in view.  Here, for the\r\npresent, I must end.  I ask no space to reply to those railers who\r\nmake such free use of the terms insolence, outrage, profanity, and\r\nblasphemy.  They obviously lack the sobriety of mind necessary to give\r\naccuracy to their statements, or to render their charges worthy of\r\nserious refutation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nIV.  VITALITY.\r\n\r\nTHE origin, growth, and energies of living things are subjects which\r\nhave always engaged the attention of thinking men.  To account for\r\nthem it was usual to assume a special agent, free to a great extent\r\nfrom the limitations observed among the powers of inorganic nature.\r\nThis agent was called _vital force_; and, under its influence, plants\r\nand animals were supposed to collect their materials and to assume\r\ndeterminate forms.  Within the last few years, however, our ideas of\r\nvital processes have undergone profound modifications; and the\r\ninterest, and even disquietude, which the change has excited are amply\r\nevidenced by the discussions and protests which are now common,\r\nregarding the phenomena of vitality.  In tracing these phenomena\r\nthrough all their modifications, the most advanced philosophers of the\r\npresent day declare that they ultimately arrive at a single source of\r\npower, from which all vital energy is derived; and the disquieting\r\ncircumstance is that this source is not the direct fiat of a\r\nsupernatural agent, but a reservoir of what, if we do not accept the\r\ncreed of Zoroaster, must be regarded as inorganic force.  In short, it\r\nis considered as proved that all the energy which we derive from\r\nplants and animals is drawn from the sun.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, when the sun was affirmed to be the source of life,\r\nnine out of ten of those who are alarmed by the form which this\r\nassertion has latterly assumed would have assented, in a general way,\r\nto its correctness.  Their assent, however, was more poetic than\r\nscientific, and they were by no means prepared to see a rigid\r\nmechanical signification attached to their words.  This, however, is\r\nthe peculiarity of modern conclusions: that there is no creative\r\nenergy whatever in the vegetable or animal organism, but that all the\r\npower which we obtain from the muscles of man and animals, as much as\r\nthat which we develop by the combustion of wood or coal, has been\r\nproduced at the sun's expense.  The sun is so much the colder that we\r\nmay have our fires; he is also so much the colder that we may have our\r\nhorse-racing and Alpine climbing.  It is, for example, certain that\r\nthe sun has been chilled to an extent capable of being accurately\r\nexpressed in numbers, in order to furnish the power which lifted this\r\nyear a certain number of tourists from the vale of Chamouni to the\r\nsummit of Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nTo most minds, however, the energy of light and heat presents itself\r\nas a thing totally distinct from ordinary mechanical energy.  Either\r\nof them can nevertheless be derived from the other.  Wood can be\r\nraised by friction to the temperature of ignition; while by properly\r\nstriking a piece of iron a skilful blacksmith can cause it to glow.\r\nThus, by the rude agency of his hammer, he generates light and heat.\r\nThis action, if carried far enough, would produce the light and heat\r\nof the sun.  In fact, the sun's light and heat have actually been\r\nreferred to the fall of meteoric matter upon his surface; and whether\r\nthe sun is thus supported or not, it is perfectly certain that he\r\nmight be thus supported.  Whether, moreover, the whilom molten\r\ncondition of our planet was, as supposed by eminent men, due to the\r\ncollision of cosmic masses or not, it is perfectly certain that the\r\nmolten condition might be thus brought about.\r\n\r\nIf, then, solar light and heat can be produced by the impact of dead\r\nmatter, and if from the light and heat thus produced we can derive the\r\nenergies which we have been accustomed to call _vital_, it indubitably\r\nfollows that vital energy may have a proximately mechanical origin.\r\n\r\nIn what sense, then, is the sun to be regarded as the origin of the\r\nenergy derivable from plants and animals?  Let us try to give an\r\nintelligible answer to this question.  Water may be raised from the\r\nsea-level to a high elevation, and then permitted to descend.  In\r\ndescending it may be made to assume various forms--to fall in\r\ncascades, to spurt in fountains, to boil in eddies, or to flow\r\ntranquilly along a uniform bed.  It may, moreover, be caused to set\r\ncomplex machinery in motion, to turn millstones, throw shuttles, work\r\nsaws and hammers, and drive piles.  But every form of power here\r\nindicated would be derived from the original power expended in raising\r\nthe water to the height from which it fell.  There is no energy\r\n_generated_ by the machinery: the work performed by the water in\r\ndescending is merely the parcelling out and distribution of the work\r\nexpended in raising it.  In precisely this sense is all the energy of\r\nplants and animals the parcelling out and distribution of a power\r\noriginally exerted by the sun.  In the case of the water, the source\r\nof the power consists in the forcible separation of a quantity of the\r\nliquid from a low level of the earth's surface, and its elevation to a\r\nhigher position, the power thus expended being returned by the water\r\nin its descent.  In the case of vital phenomena, the source of power\r\nconsists in the forcible separation of the atoms of compound\r\nsubstances by the sun.  We name the force which draws the water\r\nearthward 'gravity,' and that which draws atoms together 'chemical\r\naffinity'; but these different names must not mislead us regarding the\r\nqualitative identity of the two forces.  They are both _attractions_;\r\nand, to the intellect, the falling of carbon atoms against oxygen\r\natoms is not more difficult of conception than the falling of water to\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe building up of the vegetable, then, is effected by the sun,\r\nthrough the reduction of chemical compounds.  The phenomena of animal\r\nlife are more or less complicated reversals of these processes of\r\nreduction.  We eat the vegetable, and we breathe the oxygen of the\r\nair; and in our bodies the oxygen, which had been lifted from the\r\ncarbon and hydrogen by the action of the sun, again falls towards\r\nthem, producing animal heat and developing animal forms.  Through the\r\nmost complicated phenomena of vitality this law runs: the vegetable\r\nis produced while a weight rises, the animal is produced while a\r\nweight falls.  But the question is not exhausted here.  The water\r\nemployed in our first illustration generates all the motion displayed\r\nin its descent, but the _form_ of the motion depends on the character of\r\nthe machinery interposed in the path of the water.  In a similar way,\r\nthe primary action of the sun's rays is qualified by the atoms and\r\nmolecules among which their energy is distributed.  Molecular forces\r\ndetermine the form which the solar energy will assume.  In the\r\nseparation of the carbon and oxygen this energy may be so conditioned\r\nas to result in one case in the formation of a cabbage, and in another\r\ncase in the formation of an oak.  So also, as regards the reunion of\r\nthe carbon and the oxygen, the molecular machinery through which the\r\ncombining energy acts may, in one case, weave the texture of a frog,\r\nwhile in another it may weave the texture of a man.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the animal body is that of inorganic nature.  There is\r\nno substance in the animal tissues which is not primarily derived from\r\nthe rocks, the water, and the air.  Are the forces of organic matter,\r\nthen, different in kind from those of inorganic matter?  The\r\nphilosophy of the present day negatives the question.  It is the\r\ncompounding, in the organic world, of forces belonging equally to the\r\ninorganic, that constitutes the mystery and the miracle of vitality.\r\nEvery portion of every animal body may be reduced to purely inorganic\r\nmatter.  A perfect reversal of this process of reduction would carry\r\nus from the inorganic to the organic; and such a reversal is at least\r\nconceivable.  The tendency, indeed, of modern science is to break down\r\nthe wall of partition between organic and inorganic, and to reduce\r\nboth to the operation of forces which are the same in kind, but which\r\nare differently compounded.\r\n\r\nConsider the question of personal identity, in relation to that of\r\nmolecular form.  Thirty-four years ago, Mayer of Heilbronn, with that\r\npower of genius which breathes large meanings into scanty facts,\r\npointed out that the blood was 6 the oil of the lamp of life,' the\r\ncombustion of which sustains muscular action.  The muscles are the\r\nmachinery by which the dynamic power of the blood is brought into\r\nplay.  Thus the blood is consumed.  But the whole body, though more\r\nslowly than the blood, wastes also, so that after a certain number of\r\nyears it is entirely renewed.  How is the sense of personal identity\r\nmaintained across this flight of molecules?  To man, as we know him,\r\nmatter is necessary to consciousness; but the matter of any period may\r\nbe all changed, while consciousness exhibits no solution of\r\ncontinuity.  Like changing sentinels, the oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon\r\nthat depart, seem to whisper their secret to their comrades that\r\narrive, and thus, while the Non-ego shifts, the Ego remains the same.\r\nConstancy of form in the grouping of the molecules, and not constancy\r\nof the molecules themselves, is the correlative of this constancy of\r\nperception.  Life is a wave which in no two consecutive moments of its\r\nexistence is composed of the same particles.\r\n\r\nSupposing, then, the molecules of the human body, instead of replacing\r\nothers, and thus renewing a pre-existing form, to be gathered first\r\nhand from nature and put together in the same relative positions as\r\nthose which they occupy in the body.  Supposing them to have the\r\nselfsame forces and distribution of forces, the selfsame motions and\r\ndistribution of motions--would this organised concourse of molecules\r\nstand before us as a sentient thinking being?  There seems no valid\r\nreason to believe that it would not.  Or, supposing a planet carved\r\nfrom the sun, set spinning round an axis, and revolving round the sun\r\nat a distance from him equal to that of our earth, would one of the\r\nconsequences of its refrigeration be the development of organic forms?\r\nI lean to the affirmative.  _Structural_ forces are certainly in the\r\nmass, whether or not those forces reach to the extent of forming a\r\nplant or an animal.  In an amorphous drop of water lie latent all the\r\nmarvels of crystalline force; and who will set limits to the possible\r\nplay of molecules in a cooling planet?  If these statements startle,\r\nit is because matter has been defined and maligned by philosophers and\r\ntheologians, who were equally unaware that it is, at bottom,\r\nessentially mystical and transcendental.\r\n\r\nQuestions such as these derive their present interest in great part\r\nfrom their audacity, which is sure, in due time, to disappear.  And\r\nthe sooner the public dread is abolished with reference to such\r\nquestions the better for the cause of truth.  As regards knowledge,\r\nphysical science is polar.  In one sense it knows, or is destined to\r\nknow, everything.  In another sense it knows nothing.  Science\r\nunderstands much of this intermediate phase of things that we call\r\nnature, of which it is the product; but science knows nothing of the\r\norigin or destiny of nature.  Who or what made the sun, and gave his\r\nrays their alleged power?  Who or what made and bestowed upon the\r\nultimate particles of matter their wondrous power of varied\r\ninteraction?  Science does not know: the mystery, though pushed back,\r\nremains unaltered.  To many of us who feel that there are more things\r\nin heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the present philosophy of\r\nscience, but who have been also taught, by baffled efforts, how vain\r\nis the attempt to grapple with the Inscrutable, the ultimate frame of\r\nmind is that of Goethe:\r\n\r\n    Who dares to name His name,\r\n    Or belief in Him proclaim,\r\n    Veiled in mystery as He is, the All-enfolder?\r\n    Gleams across the mind His light,\r\n    Feels the lifted soul His might,\r\n    Dare it then deny His reign, the All-upholder?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n  As I rode through the Schwarzwald, I said to myself: That little fire\r\n  which glows star-like across the dark-growing moor, where the sooty\r\n  smith bends over his anvil, and thou hopest to replace thy lost\r\n  horse-shoe,--is it a detached, separated speck, cut off from the whole\r\n  Universe; or indissolubly joined to the whole?  Thou fool, that\r\n  smithy-fire was primarily kindled at the Sun; is fed by air that\r\n  circulates from before Noah's Deluge, from beyond the Dogstar;\r\n  therein, with Iron Force, and Coal Force, and the far stranger Force\r\n  of Man, are cunning affinities and battles and victories of Force\r\n  brought about; it is a little ganglion, or nervous centre, in the\r\n  great vital system of Immensity.  Call it, if thou wilt, an\r\n  unconscious Altar, kindled on the bosom of the All... Detached,\r\n  separated!  I say there is no such separation: nothing hitherto was\r\n  ever stranded, cast aside; but all, were it only a withered leaf,\r\n  works together with all; is borne forward on the bottomless, shoreless\r\n  flood of action, and lives through perpetual metamorphoses.--CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nV.  MATTER AND FORCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A Lecture delivered to the working men of Dundee, September\r\n5, 1867, with additions.]\r\n\r\nIt is the custom of the Professors in the Royal School of Mines in\r\nLondon to give courses of evening lectures every year to working men.\r\nThe lecture-room holds 600 people; and tickets to this amount are\r\ndisposed of as quickly as they can be handed to those who apply for\r\nthem.  So desirous are the working men of London to attend these\r\nlectures, that the persons who fail to obtain tickets always bear a\r\nlarge proportion to those who succeed.  Indeed, if the lecture-room\r\ncould hold 2,000 instead of 600, I do not doubt that every one of its\r\nbenches would be occupied on these occasions.  It is, moreover, worthy\r\nof remark that the lectures are but rarely of a character which could\r\nhelp the working man in his daily pursuits.  The information acquired\r\nis hardly ever of a nature which admits of being turned into money. It\r\nis, therefore, a pure desire for knowledge, as a thing good in itself,\r\nand without regard to its practical application, which animates the\r\nhearers of these lectures.\r\n\r\nIt is also my privilege to lecture to another audience in London,\r\ncomposed in part of the aristocracy of rank, while the audience just\r\nreferred to is composed wholly of the aristocracy of labour.  As\r\nregards attention and courtesy to the lecturer, neither of these\r\naudiences has anything to learn of the other; neither can claim\r\nsuperiority over the other.  It would not, perhaps, be quite correct\r\nto take those persons who flock to the School of Mines as average\r\nsamples of their class; they are probably picked men--the aristocracy\r\nof labour, as I have just called them.  At all events, their conduct\r\ndemonstrates that the essential qualities of what we in England\r\nunderstand by a gentleman are confined to no class; and they have\r\noften raised in my mind the wish that the gentlemen of all classes,\r\nartisans as well as lords, could, by some process of selection, be\r\nsifted from the general mass of the community, and caused to know each\r\nother better.\r\n\r\nWhen pressed some months ago by the Council of the British Association\r\nto give an evening lecture to the working men of Dundee, my experience\r\nof the working men of London naturally rose to my mind; and, though\r\nheavily weighted with other duties, I could not bring myself to\r\ndecline the request of the Council.  Hitherto, the evening discourses\r\nof the Association have been delivered before its members and\r\nassociates alone.  But after the meeting at Nottingham, last year,\r\nwhere the working men, at their own request, were addressed by our\r\nlate President, Mr. Grove, and by my excellent friend, Professor\r\nHuxley, the idea arose of incorporating with all subsequent meetings\r\nof the Association an address to the working men of the town in which\r\nthe meeting is held.  A resolution to that effect was sent to the\r\nCommittee of Recommendations; the Committee supported the resolution;\r\nthe Council of the Association ratified the decision of the Committee;\r\nand here I am to carry out to the best of my ability their united\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWhether it be a consequence of long-continued development, or an\r\nendowment conferred once for all on man at his creation, we find him\r\nhere gifted with a mind curious to know the causes of things, and\r\nsurrounded by objects which excite its questionings, and raise the\r\ndesire for an explanation.  It is related of a young Prince of one of\r\nthe Pacific Islands, that when he first saw himself in a\r\nlooking-glass, he ran round the glass to see who was standing at the\r\nback.  And thus it is with the general human intellect, as regards the\r\nphenomena of the external world.  It wishes to get behind and learn\r\nthe causes and connections of these phenomena.  What is the sun, what\r\nis the earth, what should we see if we came to the edge of the earth\r\nand looked over?  What is the meaning of thunder and lightning, of\r\nhail, rain, storm, and snow?  Such questions presented themselves to\r\nearly men, and by and by it was discovered that this desire for\r\nknowledge was not implanted in vain.  After many trials it became\r\nevident that man's capacities were, so to speak, the complement of\r\nnature's facts, and that, within certain limits, the secret of the\r\nuniverse was open to the human understanding.  It was found that the\r\nmind of man had the power of penetrating far beyond the boundaries of\r\nhis five senses; that the things which are seen in the material world\r\ndepend for their action upon things unseen; in short, that besides the\r\nphenomena which address the senses, there are laws and principles and\r\nprocesses which do not address the senses at all, but which must be,\r\nand can be, spiritually discerned.\r\n\r\nTo the subjects which require this discernment belong the phenomena of\r\nmolecular force.  But to trace the genesis of the notions now\r\nentertained upon this subject, we have to go a long way back.  In the\r\ndrawing of a bow, the darting of a javelin, the throwing of a\r\nstone--in the lifting of burdens, and in personal combats, even savage\r\nman became acquainted with the operation of _force_.  Ages of\r\ndiscipline, moreover, taught him foresight.  He laid by at the proper\r\nseason stores of food, thus obtaining time to look about him, and to\r\nbecome an observer and enquirer.  Two things which he noticed must\r\nhave profoundly stirred his curiosity.  He found that a kind of resin\r\ndropped from a certain tree possessed, when rubbed, the power of\r\ndrawing light bodies to itself, and of causing them to cling to it;\r\nand he also found that a particular stone exerted a similar power over\r\na particular kind of metal.  I allude, of course, to electrified\r\namber, and to the load-stone, or natural magnet, and its power to\r\nattract particles of iron.  Previous experience of his own muscles had\r\nenabled our early enquirer to distinguish between a push and a pull.\r\nAugmented experience showed him that in the case of the magnet and the\r\namber, pulls and pushes--attractions and repulsions--were also\r\nexerted; and, by a kind of poetic transfer, be applied to things\r\nexternal to himself, conceptions derived from himself.  The magnet and\r\nthe rubbed amber were credited with pushing and pulling, or, in other\r\nwords, with exerting force.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the great Lord Bacon the margin of these pushes and\r\npulls was vastly extended by Dr. Gilbert, a man probably of firmer\r\nscientific fibre, and of finer insight, than Bacon himself.  Gilbert\r\nproved that a multitude of other bodies, when rubbed, exerted the\r\npower which, thousands of years previously, had been observed in\r\namber.  In this way the notion of attraction and repulsion in external\r\nnature was rendered familiar.  It was a matter of experience that\r\nbodies, between which no visible link or connection existed, possessed\r\nthe power of acting upon each other; and the action came to be\r\ntechnically called 'action at a distance.'\r\n\r\nBut out of experience in science there grows something finer than mere\r\nexperience.  Experience furnishes the soil for plants of higher\r\ngrowth; and this observation of action at a distance provided material\r\nfor speculation upon the largest of problems.  Bodies were observed to\r\nfall to the earth.  Why should they do so?  The earth was proved to\r\nrevolve round the sun; and the moon to revolve round the earth.  Why\r\nshould they do so?  What prevents them from flying straight off into\r\nspace?  Supposing it were ascertained that from a part of the earth's\r\nrocky crust a firmly fixed and tightly stretched chain started towards\r\nthe sun, we might be inclined to conclude that the earth is held in\r\nits orbit by the chain--that the sun twirls the earth around him, as a\r\nboy twirls round his head a bullet at the end of a string.  But why\r\nshould the chain be needed?  It is a fact of experience that bodies\r\ncan attract each other at a distance, without the intervention of any\r\nchain.  Why should not the sun and earth so attract each other?  and\r\nwhy should not the fall of bodies from a height be the result of their\r\nattraction by the earth?  Here then we reach one of those higher\r\nspeculations which grow out of the fruitful soil of observation.\r\nHaving started with the savage, and his sensations of muscular force,\r\nwe pass on to the observation of force exerted between a magnet and\r\nrubbed amber and the bodies which they attract, rising, by an unbroken\r\ngrowth of ideas, to a conception of the force by which sun and planets\r\nare held together.\r\n\r\nThis idea of attraction between sun and planets had become familiar in\r\nthe time of Newton.  He set himself to examine the attraction; and\r\nhere, as elsewhere, we find the speculative mind falling back for its\r\nmaterials upon experience.  It had been observed, in the case of\r\nmagnetic and electric bodies, that the nearer they were brought\r\ntogether the stronger was the force exerted between them; while, by\r\nincreasing the distance, the force diminished until it became\r\ninsensible.  Hence the inference that the assumed pull between the\r\nearth and the sun would be influenced by their distance asunder.\r\nGuesses had been made as to the exact manner in which the force varied\r\nwith the distance; but Newton supplemented the guess by the severe\r\ntest of experiment and calculation.  Comparing the pull of the earth\r\nupon a body close to its surface, with its pull upon the moon, 240,000\r\nmiles away, Newton rigidly established the law of variation with the\r\ndistance.  But on his way to this result Newton found room for other\r\nconceptions, some of which, indeed, constituted the necessary\r\nstepping-stones to his result.  The one which here concerns us is,\r\nthat not only does the sun attract the earth, and the earth attract\r\nthe sun, as wholes, but every particle of the sun attracts every\r\nparticle of the earth, and the reverse.  His conclusion was, that the\r\nattraction of the masses was simply the sum of the attractions of\r\ntheir constituent particles.\r\n\r\nThis result seems so obvious that you will perhaps wonder at my\r\ndwelling upon it; but it really marks a turning point in our notions\r\nof force.  You have probably heard of certain philosophers of the\r\nancient world named Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius.  These men\r\nadopted, developed, and diffused the doctrine of atoms and molecules,\r\nwhich found its consummation at the hands of the illustrious John\r\nDalton.  But the Greek and Roman philosophers I have named, and their\r\nfollowers, up to the time of Newton, pictured their atoms as falling\r\nand flying through space, hitting each other, and clinging together by\r\nimaginary hooks and claws.  They missed the central idea that atoms\r\nand molecules could come together, not by being fortuitously knocked\r\nAgainst each other, but by their own mutual attractions.  This is one\r\nof the great steps taken by Newton.  He familiarised the world with\r\nthe conception of _molecular force_.\r\n\r\nNewton, you know, was preceded by a grand fellow named John Kepler--a\r\ntrue working man--who, by analysing the astronomical observations of\r\nhis master, Tycho Brahe, had actually found that the planets moved as\r\nthey are now known to move.  Kepler knew as much about the motion of\r\nthe planets as Newton did; in fact, Kepler taught Newton and the world\r\ngenerally the facts of planetary motion.  But this was not enough. The\r\nquestion arose--Why should the facts be so?  This was the great\r\nquestion for Newton, and it was the solution of it which renders his\r\nname and fame immortal.  Starting from the principle that every\r\nparticle of matter in the solar system attracts every other particle\r\nby a force which varies as the inverse square of the distance between\r\nthe particles, he proved that the Planetary motions must be what\r\nobservation makes them to be.  He showed that the moon fell towards\r\nthe earth, and that the planets fell towards the sun, through the\r\noperation of the same force that pulls an apple from its tree.  This\r\nall-pervading force, which forms the solder of the material universe,\r\nand the conception of which was necessary to Newton's intellectual\r\npeace, is called the force of gravitation.\r\n\r\nGravitation is a purely attractive force, but in electricity and\r\nmagnetism, repulsion had been always seen to accompany attraction.\r\nElectricity and magnetism are double or _polar forces_.  In the case of\r\nmagnetism, experience soon pushed the mind beyond the bounds of\r\nexperience, compelling it to conclude that the polarity of the magnet\r\nwas resident in its molecules.  I hold a magnetised strip of steel by\r\nits centre, and find that one half of the strip attracts, and the\r\nother half repels, the north end of a magnetic needle.  I break the\r\nstrip in the middle, find that this half, which a moment ago attracted\r\nthroughout its entire length the north pole of a magnetic needle, is\r\nnow divided into two new halves, one of which wholly attracts, and the\r\nother of which wholly repels, the north pole of the needle.  The half\r\nproves to be as perfect a magnet as the whole.  You may break this\r\nhalf and go on till further breaking becomes impossible through the\r\nvery smallness of the fragments; the smallest fragment is found\r\nendowed with two poles, and is, therefore, a perfect magnet.  But you\r\ncannot stop here: you _imagine_ where you cannot _experiment_; and reach\r\nthe conclusion entertained by all scientific men, that the magnet\r\nwhich you see and feel is an assemblage of molecular magnets which you\r\ncannot see and feel, but which, as before stated, must be\r\nintellectually discerned.\r\n\r\nMagnetism then is a polar force; and experience hints that a force of\r\nthis kind may exert a certain structural power.  It is known, for\r\nexample, that iron filings strewn round a magnet arrange themselves in\r\ndefinite lines, called, by some, 'magnetic curves,' and, by others,\r\n'lines of magnetic force.' Over two magnets now before me is spread a\r\nsheet of paper.  Scattering iron filings over the paper, polar force\r\ncomes into play, and every particle of the iron responds to that\r\nforce.  We have a kind of architectural effort--if I may use the\r\nterm--exerted on the part of the iron filings.  Here then is a fact of\r\nexperience which, as you will see immediately, furnishes further\r\nmaterial for the mind to operate upon, rendering it possible to attain\r\nintellectual clearness and repose, while speculating upon apparently\r\nremote phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic force has here acted upon particles visible to the eye.\r\nBut, as already stated, there are numerous processes in nature which\r\nentirely elude the eye of the body, and must be figured by the eye of\r\nthe mind.  The processes of chemistry are examples of these.  Long\r\nthinking and experimenting has led philosophers to conclude that\r\nmatter is composed of atoms from which, whether separate or in\r\ncombination, the whole material world is built up.  The air we\r\nbreathe, for example, as mainly a mechanical mixture of the atoms of\r\noxygen and nitrogen.  The water we drink is also composed of oxygen\r\nand hydrogen.  But it differs from the air in this particular, that in\r\nwater the oxygen and hydrogen are not mechanically mixed, but\r\nchemically combined.  The atoms of oxygen and those of hydrogen exert\r\nenormous attractions on each other, so that when brought into\r\nsufficient proximity they rush together with an almost incredible\r\nforce to form a chemical compound.  But powerful as is the force with\r\nwhich these atoms lock themselves together, we have the means of\r\ntearing them asunder, and the agent by which we accomplish this may\r\nhere receive a few moments' attention.\r\n\r\nInto a vessel containing acidulated water I dip two strips of metal,\r\nthe one being zinc and the other platinum, not permitting them to\r\ntouch each other in the liquid.  I connect the two upper ends of the\r\nstrips by a piece of copper wire.  The wire is now the channel of\r\nwhat, for want of a better name, we call an 6 electric current.' What\r\nthe inner change of the wire is we do not know, but we do know that a\r\nchange has occurred, by the external effects produced by the wire. Let\r\nme show you one or two of these effects.  Before you is a series of\r\nten vessels, each with its pair of metals, and I wish to get the added\r\nforce of all ten.  The arrangement is called a voltaic battery. I\r\nplunge a piece of copper wire among these iron filings; they refuse to\r\ncling to it.  I employ the selfsame wire to connect the two ends of\r\nthe battery, and subject it to the same test. The iron filings now\r\ncrowd round the wire and cling to it.  I interrupt the current, and\r\nthe filings immediately fall; the power of attraction continues only\r\nso long as the wire connects the two ends of the battery.\r\n\r\nHere is a piece of similar wire, overspun with cotton, to prevent the\r\ncontact of its various parts, and formed into a coil.  I make the coil\r\npart of the wire which connects the two ends of the voltaic battery.\r\nBy the attractive force with which it has become suddenly endowed, it\r\nnow empties this tool-box of its iron nails.  I twist a covered copper\r\nwire round this common poker; connecting the wire with the two ends of\r\nthe voltaic battery, the poker is instantly transformed into a strong\r\nmagnet.  Two flat spirals are here suspended facing each other, about\r\nsix inches apart.  Sending a current through both spirals, they clash\r\nsuddenly together; reversing what is called the direction of the\r\ncurrent in one of the spirals, they fly asunder.  All these effects\r\nare due to the power which we name an electric current, and which we\r\nfigure as flowing through the wire when the voltaic circuit is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nBy the same agent we tear asunder the locked atoms of a chemical\r\ncompound.  Into this small cell, containing water, dip two thin wires.\r\nA magnified image of the cell is thrown upon the screen before you,\r\nand you see plainly the images of the wires.  From a small battery I\r\nsend an electric current from wire to wire.  Bubbles of gas rise\r\nimmediately from each of them, and these are the two gases of which\r\nthe water is composed.  The oxygen is always liberated on the one\r\nwire, the hydrogen on the other.  The gases may be collected either\r\nseparately or mixed.  I place upon my hand a soap bubble filled with\r\nthe mixture of both gases.  Applying a taper to the bubble, a loud\r\nexplosion is heard.  The atoms have rushed together with detonation,\r\nand without injury to my hand, and the water from which they were\r\nextracted is the result of their re-union.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nOne consequence of the rushing together of the atoms is the\r\ndevelopment of heat.  What is this heat?  Here are two ivory balls\r\nsuspended from the same point of support by two short strings.  I draw\r\nthem thus apart and then liberate them.  They clash together, but, by\r\nvirtue of their elasticity, they quickly recoil, and a sharp vibratory\r\nrattle succeeds their collision.  This experiment will enable you to\r\nfigure to your mind a pair of clashing atoms.  We have in the first\r\nplace, a motion of the one atom towards the other--a motion of\r\ntranslation, as it is usually called--then a recoil, and afterwards a\r\nmotion of vibration.  To this vibratory motion we give the name of\r\nheat.  Thus, three things are to be kept before the mind--first, the\r\natoms themselves; secondly, the force with which they attract each\r\nother; and thirdly, the motion consequent upon the exertion of that\r\nforce.  This motion must be figured first as a motion of translation,\r\nand then as a motion of vibration, to which latter we give the name of\r\nheat.  For some time after the act of combination this motion is so\r\nviolent as to prevent the molecules from coming together, the water\r\nbeing maintained in a state of vapour.  But as the vapour cools, or in\r\nother words loses its motion, the molecules coalesce to form a liquid.\r\n\r\nAnd now we approach a new and wonderful display of force.  As long as\r\nthe substance remains in a liquid or vaporous condition, the play of\r\nthis force is altogether masked and bidden.  But as the heat is\r\ngradually withdrawn, the molecules prepare for new arrangements and\r\ncombinations.  Solid crystals of water are at length formed, to which\r\nwe give the familiar name of ice.  Looking at these beautiful edifices\r\nand their internal structure, the pondering mind has forced upon it\r\nthe question, How are they built up?  We have obtained clear\r\nconceptions of polar force; and we infer from our broken magnet that\r\npolar force may be resident in the molecules or smallest particles of\r\nmatter, and that by the play of this force structural arrangement is\r\npossible.  What, in relation to our present question, is the natural\r\naction of a mind furnished with this knowledge?  It is compelled to\r\ntranscend experience, and endow the atoms and molecules of which\r\ncrystals are built with definite poles whence issue attractions and\r\nrepulsions.  In virtue of these forces some poles are drawn together,\r\nwhile some retreat from each other; atom is added to atom, and\r\nmolecule to molecule, not boisterously or fortuitously, but silently\r\nand symmetrically, and in accordance with laws more rigid than those\r\nwhich guide a human builder when he places his materials together.\r\nImagine the bricks and stones of this town of Dundee endowed with\r\nstructural power.\r\n\r\nImagine them attracting and repelling, and arranging themselves into\r\nstreets and houses and Kinnaird Halls--would not that be wonderful?\r\nHardly less wonderful is the play of force by which the molecules of\r\nwater build themselves into the sheets of ice which every winter roof\r\nyour ponds and lakes.\r\n\r\nIf I could show you the actual progress of this molecular\r\narchitecture, its beauty would delight and astonish you.  A reversal\r\nof the process of crystallisation may be actually shown.  The\r\nmolecules of a piece of ice may be taken asunder before your eyes; and\r\nfrom the manner in which they separate, you may to some extent infer\r\nthe manner in which they go together.  When a beam is sent from our\r\nelectric lamp through a plate of glass, a portion of the beam is\r\nintercepted, and the glass is warmed by the portion thus retained\r\nwithin it.  When the beam is sent through a plate of ice, a portion of\r\nthe beam is also absorbed; but instead of warming the ice, the\r\nintercepted heat melts it internally.  It is to the delicate silent\r\naction of this beam within the ice that I now wish to direct your\r\nattention.  Upon the screen is thrown a magnified image of the slab of\r\nice: the light of the beam passes freely through the ice without\r\nmelting it, and enables us to form the image; but the heat is in great\r\npart intercepted, and that heat now applies itself to the work of\r\ninternal liquefaction.  Selecting certain points for attack, round\r\nabout those points the beam works silently, undoing the crystalline\r\narchitecture, and reducing to the freedom of liquidity molecules which\r\nhad been previously locked in a solid embrace.  The liquefied spaces\r\nare rendered visible by strong illumination.  Observe those\r\nsix-petaled flowers breaking out over the white surface, and expanding\r\nin size as the action of the beam continues.  These flowers are\r\nliquefied ice.  Under the action of the heat the molecules of the\r\ncrystals fall asunder, so as to leave behind them these exquisite\r\nforms.  We have here a process of demolition which clearly reveals the\r\nreverse process of construction.  In this fashion, and in strict\r\naccordance with this hexangular type, every ice molecule takes its\r\nplace upon our ponds and lakes during the frosts of winter.  To use\r\nthe language of an American poet, 'the atoms march in tune,' moving to\r\nthe music of law, which thus renders the commonest substance in nature\r\na miracle of beauty.\r\n\r\nIt is the function of science, not as some think to divest this\r\nuniverse of its wonder and mystery, but, as in the case before us, to\r\npoint out the wonder and the mystery of common things.  Those\r\nfern-like forms, which on a frosty morning overspread your\r\nwindowpanes, illustrate the action of the same force.  Breathe upon\r\nsuch a pane before the fires are lighted, and reduce the solid\r\ncrystalline film to the liquid condition; then watch its subsequent\r\nresolidification.  You will see it all the better if you look at it\r\nthrough a common magnifying glass.  After you have ceased breathing,\r\nthe film, abandoned to the action of its own forces, appears for a\r\nmoment to be alive.  Lines of motion run through it; molecule closes\r\nwith molecule, until finally the whole film passes from the state of\r\nliquidity, through this state of motion, to its final crystalline\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nI can show you something similar.  Over a piece of perfectly clean\r\nglass I pour a little water in which certain crystals have been\r\ndissolved.  A film of the solution clings to the glass.  By means of a\r\nmicroscope and a lamp, an image of the plate of glass is thrown upon\r\nthe screen.  The beam of the lamp, besides illuminating the glass,\r\nalso heats it; evaporation sets in, and at a certain moment, when the\r\nsolution has become supersaturated, splendid branches of crystal shoot\r\nout over the screen.  A dozen square feet of surface are now covered\r\nby those beautiful forms.  With another solution we obtain crystalline\r\nspears, feathered right and left by other spears.  From distant nuclei\r\nin the middle of the field of view the spears shoot with magical\r\nrapidity in all directions.  The film of water on a window-pane on a\r\nfrosty morning exhibits effects quite as wonderful as these.  Latent\r\nin these formless solutions, latent in every drop of water, lies this\r\nmarvellous structural power, which only requires the withdrawal of\r\nopposing forces to bring it into action.\r\n\r\nThe clear liquid now held up before you is a solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver--a compound of silver and nitric acid.  When an electric\r\ncurrent is sent through this liquid the silver is severed from the\r\nacid, as the hydrogen was separated from the oxygen in a former\r\nexperiment; and I would ask you to observe how the metal behaves when\r\nits molecules are thus successively set free.  The image of the cell,\r\nand of the two wires which dip into the liquid of the cell, are now\r\nclearly shown upon the screen.  Let us close the circuit, and send the\r\ncurrent through the liquid.  From one of the wires a beautiful silver\r\ntree commences immediately to sprout.  Branches of the metal are\r\nthrown out, and umbrageous foliage loads the branches.  You have here\r\na growth, apparently as wonderful as that of any vegetable, perfected\r\nin a minute before your eyes.  Substituting for the nitrate of silver\r\nacetate of lead, which is a compound of lead and acetic acid, the\r\nelectric current severs the lead from the acid, and you see the metal\r\nslowly branching into exquisite metallic ferns, the fronds of which,\r\nas they become too heavy, break from their roots and fall to the\r\nbottom of the cell.\r\n\r\nThese experiments show that the common matter of our earth--'brute\r\nmatter,' as Dr. Young, in his _Night Thoughts_, is pleased to call\r\nit--when its atoms and molecules are permitted to bring their forces\r\ninto free play, arranges itself, under the operation of these forces,\r\ninto forms which rival in beauty those of the vegetable world.  And\r\nwhat is the vegetable world itself, but the result of the complex play\r\nof these molecular forces?  Here, as elsewhere throughout nature, if\r\nmatter moves it is force that moves it, and if a certain structure,\r\nvegetable or mineral, is produced, it is through the operation of the\r\nforces exerted between the atoms and molecules.\r\n\r\nThe solid matter of which our lead and silver trees were formed was,\r\nin the first instance, disguised in a transparent liquid; the solid\r\nmatter of which our woods and forests are composed is also, for the\r\nmost part disguised in a transparent gas, which is mixed in small\r\nquantities with the air of our atmosphere.  This gas is formed by the\r\nunion of carbon and oxygen, and is called carbonic acid gas.  The\r\ncarbonic acid of the air being subjected to an action somewhat\r\nanalogous to that of the electric current in the case of our lead and\r\nsilver solutions, has its carbon liberated and deposited as woody\r\nfibre.  The watery vapour of the air is subjected to similar action;\r\nits hydrogen is liberated from its oxygen, and lies down side by side\r\nwith the carbon in the tissues of the tree.  The oxygen in both cases\r\nis permitted to wander away into the atmosphere.  But what is it in\r\nnature that plays the part of the electric current in our experiments,\r\ntearing asunder the locked atoms of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen?  The\r\nrays of the sun.  The leaves of plants which absorb both the carbonic\r\nacid and the aqueous vapour of the air, answer to the cells in which\r\nour decompositions took place.  And just as the molecular attractions\r\nof the silver and the lead found expression in those beautiful\r\nbranching forms seen in our experiments, so do the molecular\r\nattractions of the liberated carbon and hydrogen find expression in\r\nthe architecture of grasses, plants, and trees.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of a cataract and the rush of the wind we have examples of\r\nmechanical power.  In the combinations of chemistry and in the\r\nformation of crystals and vegetables we have examples of molecular\r\npower.  You have learned how the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen rush\r\ntogether to form water.  I have not thought it necessary to dwell upon\r\nthe mighty mechanical energy of their act of combination; but it may\r\nbe said, in passing, that the clashing together of 1 lb.  of hydrogen\r\nand 8 lbs. of oxygen to form 9 lbs. of aqueous vapour, is greater than\r\nthe shock of a weight of 1,000 tons falling from a height of 20 feet\r\nagainst the earth.  Now, in order that the atoms of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen should rise by their mutual attractions to the velocity\r\ncorresponding to this enormous mechanical effect, a certain distance\r\nmust exist between the particles.  It is in rushing over this that the\r\nvelocity is attained.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThis idea of distance between the attracting atoms is of the highest\r\nimportance in our conception of the system of the world.  For the\r\nmatter of the world may be classified under two distinct heads: atoms\r\nand molecules which have already combined and thus satisfied their\r\nmutual attractions, and atoms and molecules which have not yet\r\ncombined, and whose mutual attractions are, therefore, unsatisfied.\r\nNow, as regards motive power, we are entirely dependent on atoms and\r\nmolecules of the latter kind.  Their attractions can produce motion,\r\nbecause sufficient distance intervenes between the attracting atoms,\r\nand it is this atomic motion that we utilise in our machines.  Thus we\r\ncan get power out of oxygen and hydrogen by the act of their union;\r\nbut once they are combined, and once the vibratory motion consequent\r\non their combination has been expended, no further power can be got\r\nout of their mutual attraction.  As dynamic agents they are dead.  The\r\nmaterials of the earth's crust consist for the most part of substances\r\nwhose atoms have already closed in chemical union--whose mutual\r\nattractions are satisfied.  Granite, for instance, is a widely\r\ndiffused substance; but granite consists, in great part, of silicon,\r\noxygen, potassium, calcium, and aluminum, whose atoms united long ago,\r\nand are therefore dead.  Limestone is composed of carbon, oxygen, and\r\na metal called calcium, the atoms of which have already closed in\r\nchemical union, and are therefore finally at rest. In this way we\r\nmight go over nearly the whole of the materials of the earth's crust,\r\nand satisfy ourselves that though they were sources of power in ages\r\npast, and long before any creature appeared on the earth capable of\r\nturning their power to account, they are sources of power no longer.\r\nAnd here we might halt for a moment to remark on that tendency, so\r\nprevalent in the world, to regard everything as made for human use.\r\nThose who entertain this notion, hold, I think, an overweening opinion\r\nof their own importance in the system of nature.  Flowers bloomed\r\nbefore men saw them, and the quantity of power wasted before man could\r\nutilise it is all but infinite compared with what now remains.  We are\r\ntruly heirs of all the ages; but as honest men it behoves us to learn\r\nthe extent of our inheritance, and as brave ones not to whimper if it\r\nshould prove less than we had supposed.  The healthy attitude of mind\r\nwith reference to this subject is that of the poet, who, when asked\r\nwhence came the rhodora, joyfully acknowledged his brotherhood with\r\nthe flower:\r\n\r\n    Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!\r\n    I never thought to ask, I never knew,\r\n    But in my simple ignorance supposed\r\n    The self-same power that brought me there brought you.\r\n\r\n                                     Emerson.\r\n\r\nA few exceptions to the general state of union of the molecules of the\r\nearth's crust--vast in relation to us, but trivial in comparison to\r\nthe total store of which they are the residue--still remain.  They\r\nconstitute our main sources of motive power.  By far the most\r\nimportant of these are our beds of coal.  Distance still intervenes\r\nbetween the atoms of carbon and those of atmospheric oxygen, across\r\nwhich the atoms may be urged by their mutual attractions; and we can\r\nutilise the motion thus produced.  Once the carbon and the oxygen have\r\nrushed together, so as to form carbonic acid, their mutual attractions\r\nare satisfied; and, while they continue in this condition, as dynamic\r\nagents they are dead.  Our woods and forests are also sources of\r\nmechanical energy, because they have the power of uniting with the\r\natmospheric oxygen.  Passing from plants to animals, we find that the\r\nsource of motive power just referred to is also the source of muscular\r\npower.  A horse can perform work, and so can a man; but this work is\r\nat bottom the molecular work of the transmuted food and the oxygen of\r\nthe air.  We inhale this vital gas, and bring it into sufficiently\r\nclose proximity with the carbon and the hydrogen of the body.  These\r\nunite in obedience to their mutual, attractions; and their motion\r\ntowards each other, properly turned to account by the wonderful\r\nmechanism of the body, becomes muscular motion.\r\n\r\nOne fundamental thought pervades all these statements: there is one\r\ntap root from which they all spring.  This is the ancient maxim that\r\nout of nothing nothing comes; that neither in the organic world nor in\r\nthe inorganic is power produced without the expenditure of power; that\r\nneither in the plant nor in the animal is there a creation of force or\r\nmotion.  Trees grow, and so do men and horses; and here we have new\r\npower incessantly introduced upon the earth.  But its source, as I\r\nhave already stated, is the sun.  It is the sun that separates the\r\ncarbon from the oxygen of the carbonic acid, and thus enables them to\r\nrecombine.  Whether they recombine in the furnace of the steam-engine\r\nor in the animal body, the origin of the power they produce is the\r\nsame.  In this sense we are all 'souls of fire and children of the\r\nsun.' But, as remarked by Helmholtz, we must be content to share our\r\ncelestial pedigree with the meanest of living things.\r\n\r\nSome estimable persons, here present, very possibly shrink from\r\naccepting these statements; they may be frightened by their apparent\r\ntendency towards what is called materialism--a word which, to many\r\nminds, expresses something very dreadful.  But it ought to be known\r\nand avowed that the physical philosopher, as such, must be a pure\r\nmaterialist. His enquiries deal with matter and force, and with them\r\nalone.  And whatever be the forms which matter and force assume,\r\nwhether in the organic world or the inorganic, whether in the\r\ncoal-beds and forests of the earth, or in the brains and muscles of\r\nmen, the physical philosopher will make good his right to investigate\r\nthem.  It is perfectly vain to attempt to stop enquiry in this\r\ndirection.  Depend upon it, if a chemist by bringing the proper\r\nmaterials together, in a retort or crucible, could make a baby, he\r\nwould do it.  There is no law, moral or physical, forbidding him to do\r\nit.  At the present moment there are, no doubt, persons experimenting\r\non the possibility of producing what we call life out of inorganic\r\nmaterials.  Let them pursue their studies in peace; it is only by such\r\ntrials that they will learn the limits of their own powers and the\r\noperation of the laws of matter and force.\r\n\r\nBut while thus making the largest demand for freedom of\r\ninvestigation--while I consider science to be alike powerful as an\r\ninstrument of intellectual culture and as a ministrant to the material\r\nwants of men; if you ask me whether it has solved, or is likely in our\r\nday to solve, the problem of this universe, I must shake my head in\r\ndoubt.  You remember the first Napoleon's question, when the savants\r\nwho accompanied him to Egypt discussed in his presence the origin of\r\nthe universe, and solved it to their own apparent satisfaction.  He\r\nlooked aloft to the starry heavens, and said, 'It is all very well,\r\ngentlemen; but who made these?'  That question still remains\r\nunanswered, and science makes no attempt to answer it.  As far as I\r\ncan see, there is no quality in the human intellect which is fit to be\r\napplied to the solution of the problem.  It entirely transcends us.\r\nThe mind of man may be compared to a musical instrument with a certain\r\nrange of notes, beyond which in both directions we have an infinitude\r\nof silence.  The phenomena of matter and force lie within our\r\nintellectual range, and as far as they reach we will at all hazards\r\npush our enquiries.  But behind, and above, and around all, the real\r\nmystery of this universe lies unsolved, and, as far as we are\r\nconcerned, is incapable of solution.  Fashion this mystery as you\r\nwill, with that I have nothing to do.  But let your conception of it\r\nnot be an unworthy one.  Invest that conception with your highest and\r\nholiest thought, but be careful of pretending to know more about it\r\nthan is given to man to know.  Be careful, above all things, of\r\nprofessing to see in the phenomena of the material world the evidences\r\nof Divine pleasure or displeasure.  Doubt those who would deduce from\r\nthe fall of the tower of Siloam the anger of the Lord against those\r\nwho were crushed.  Doubt equally those who pretend to see in cholera,\r\ncattle-plague, and bad harvests, evidences of Divine anger.  Doubt\r\nthose spiritual guides who in Scotland have lately propounded the\r\nmonstrous theory that the depreciation of railway scrip is a\r\nconsequence of railway travelling on Sundays.  Let them not, as far as\r\nyou are concerned, libel the system of nature with their ignorant\r\nhypotheses.  Looking from the solitudes of thought into this highest\r\nof questions, and seeing the puerile attempts often made to solve it,\r\nwell might the mightiest of living Scotchmen--that strong and earnest\r\nsoul, who has made every soul of like nature in these islands his\r\ndebtor--well, I say, might your noble old Carlyle scornfully retort on\r\nsuch interpreters of the ways of God to men:\r\n\r\n    The Builder of this universe was wise,\r\n    He formed all souls, all systems, planets, particles;\r\n    The plan he formed his worlds and Aeons by,\r\n    Was--Heavens!--was thy small nine-and-thirty articles!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n\r\n  Here, indeed, we arrive at the barrier which needs to be perpetually\r\n  pointed out; alike to those who seek materialistic explanations of\r\n  mental phenomena, and to those who are alarmed lest such explanations\r\n  may be found.  The last class prove by their fear almost as much as\r\n  the first prove by their hope, that they believe Mind may possibly be\r\n  interpreted in terms of Matter; whereas many whom they vituperate as\r\n  materialists are profoundly convinced that there is not the remotest\r\n  possibility of so interpreting them.\r\n\r\n                                         HERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.  SCIENTIFIC MATERIALISM.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: President's Address to the Mathematical and Physical\r\nSection of the British Association at Norwich.]\r\n\r\n1868.\r\n\r\nTHE celebrated Fichte, in his lectures on the 'Vocation of the\r\nScholar,' insisted on a culture which should be not one-sided, but\r\nall-sided.  The scholar's intellect was to expand spherically, and not\r\nin a single direction only.  In one direction, however, Fichte\r\nrequired that the scholar should apply himself directly to nature,\r\nbecome a creator of knowledge, and thus repay, by original labours of\r\nhis own, the immense debt he owed to the labours of others.  It was\r\nthese which enabled him to supplement the knowledge derived from his\r\nown researches, so as to render his culture rounded and not one-sided.\r\n\r\nAs regards science, Fichte's idea is to some extent illustrated by the\r\nconstitution and labours of the British Association.  We have here a\r\nbody of men engaged in the pursuit of Natural Knowledge, but variously\r\nengaged.  While sympathising with each of its departments, and\r\nsupplementing his culture by knowledge drawn from all of them, each\r\nstudent amongst us selects one subject for the exercise of his own\r\noriginal faculty--one line, along which he may carry the light of his\r\nprivate intelligence a little way into the darkness by which all\r\nknowledge is surrounded.  Thus, the geologist deals with the rocks;\r\nthe biologist with the conditions and phenomena of life; the\r\nastronomer with stellar masses and motions; the mathematician with the\r\nrelations of space and number; the chemist pursues his atoms; while\r\nthe physical investigator has his own large field in optical, thermal,\r\nelectrical, acoustical, and other phenomena.  The British Association\r\nthen, as a whole, faces physical nature on all sides, and pushes\r\nknowledge centrifugally outwards, the sum of its labours constituting\r\nwhat Fichte might call the sphere of natural knowledge.  In the\r\nmeetings of the Association it is found necessary to resolve this\r\nsphere into its component parts, which take concrete form under the\r\nrespective letters of our Sections.\r\n\r\nMathematics and Physics have been long accustomed to coalesce, and\r\nhere they form a single section.  No matter how subtle a natural\r\nphenomenon may be, whether we observe it in the region of sense, or\r\nfollow it into that of imagination, it is in the long run reducible to\r\nmechanical laws.  But the mechanical data once guessed or given,\r\nmathematics are all-powerful as an instrument of deduction.  The\r\ncommand of Geometry over the relations of space, and the far-reaching\r\npower which Analysis confers, are potent both As means of physical\r\ndiscovery, and of reaping the entire fruits of discovery.  Indeed,\r\nwithout mathematics, expressed or implied, our knowledge of physical\r\nscience would be both friable and incomplete.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the mathematical method we have the method of\r\nexperiment.  Here from a starting-point furnished by his own\r\nresearches or those of others, the investigator proceeds by combining\r\nintuition and verication.  He ponders the knowledge he possesses, and\r\ntries to push it further; he guesses, and checks his guess; he\r\nconjectures, and confirms or explodes his conjecture.  These guesses\r\nand conjectures are by no means leaps in the dark; for knowledge once\r\ngained casts a faint light beyond its own immediate boundaries.  There\r\nis no discovery so limited as not to illuminate something beyond\r\nitself.  The force of intellectual penetration into this penumbral\r\nregion which surrounds actual knowledge is not, as some seem to think,\r\ndependent upon method, but upon the genius of the investigator.  There\r\nis, however, no genius so gifted as not to need control and\r\nverification.  The profoundest minds know best that Nature's ways are\r\nnot at all times their ways, and that the brightest flashes in the\r\nworld of thought are incomplete until they have been proved to have\r\ntheir counterparts in the world of fact.  Thus the vocation of the\r\ntrue experimentalist may be defined as the continued exercise of\r\nspiritual insight, and its incessant correction and realisation.  His\r\nexperiments constitute a body, of which his purified intuitions are,\r\nas it were, the soul.\r\n\r\nPartly through mathematical and partly through experimental research,\r\nphysical science has, of late years, assumed a momentous position in\r\nthe world.  Both in a material and in an intellectual point of view it\r\nhas produced, and it is destined to produce, immense changes--vast\r\nsocial ameliorations, and vast alterations in the popular conception\r\nof the origin, rule, and governance of natural things.  By science, in\r\nthe physical world, miracles are wrought, while philosophy is\r\nforsaking its ancient metaphysical channels, and pursuing others which\r\nhave been opened, or indicated by, scientific research.  This must\r\nbecome more and more the case as philosophical writers become more\r\ndeeply imbued with the methods of science, better acquainted with the\r\nfacts which scientific men have established, and with the great\r\ntheories which they have elaborated.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the face of a watch, you see the hour and minute-hands,\r\nand possibly also a second-hand, moving over the graduated dial.  Why\r\ndo these hands move?  and why are their relative motions such as they\r\nare observed to be?  These questions cannot be answered without\r\nopening the watch, mastering its various parts, and ascertaining their\r\nrelationship to each other.  When this is done, we find that the\r\nobserved motion of the hands follows of necessity from the inner\r\nmechanism of the watch when acted upon by the force invested in the\r\nspring.  The motion of the hands may be called a phenomenon of art,\r\nbut the case is similar with the phenomena of nature.  These also have\r\ntheir inner mechanism and their store of force to set that mechanism\r\ngoing.  The ultimate problem of physical science is to reveal this\r\nmechanism, to discern this store, and to show that from the combined\r\naction of both, the phenomena of which they constitute the basis,\r\nmust, of necessity, flow.\r\n\r\nI thought an attempt to give you even a brief and sketchy illustration\r\nof the manner in which scientific thinkers regard this problem, would\r\nnot be uninteresting to you on the present occasion; more especially\r\nas it will give me occasion to say a word or two on the tendencies and\r\nlimits of modern science; to point out the region which men of science\r\nclaim as their own, and where it is futile to oppose their advance;\r\nand also to define, if possible, the bourne between this and that\r\nother region, to which the questionings and yearnings of the\r\nscientific intellect are directed in vain.\r\n\r\nBut here your tolerance will be needed.  It was the American Emerson,\r\nI think, who said that it is hardly possible to state any truth\r\nstrongly, without apparent injustice to some other truth.  Truth is\r\noften of a dual character, taking the form of a magnet with two poles;\r\nand many of the differences which agitate the thinking part of mankind\r\nare to be traced to the exclusiveness with which partisan reasoners\r\ndwell upon one half of the duality, in forgetfulness of the other. The\r\nproper course appears to be to state both halves strongly, and allow\r\neach its fair share in the formation of the resultant conviction.  But\r\nthis waiting for the statement of the two sides of a question implies\r\npatience.  It implies a resolution to suppress indignation, if the\r\nstatement of the one half should clash with our convictions; and to\r\nrepress equally undue elation, if the half-statement should happen to\r\nchime in with our views.  It implies a determination to wait calmly\r\nfor the statement of the whole, before we pronounce judgment in the\r\nform of either acquiescence or dissent.\r\n\r\nThis premised, and I trust accepted, let us enter upon our task. There\r\nhave been writers who affirmed that the Pyramids of Egypt were natural\r\nproductions; and in his early youth Alexander von Humboldt wrote a\r\nlearned essay with the express object of refuting this notion. We now\r\nregard the pyramids as the work of men's hands, aided probably by\r\nmachinery of which no record remains.  We picture to ourselves the\r\nswarming workers toiling at those vast erections, lifting the inert\r\nstones, and, guided by the volition, the skill, and possibly at times\r\nby the whip of the architect, placing them in their proper positions.\r\nThe blocks, in this case, were moved and posited by a power external\r\nto themselves, and the final form of the pyramid expressed the thought\r\nof its human builder.\r\n\r\nLet us pass from this illustration of constructive power to another of\r\na different kind.  When a solution of common salt is slowly\r\nevaporated, the water which holds the salt in solution disappears, but\r\nthe salt itself remains behind.  At a certain stage of concentration\r\nthe salt can no longer retain the liquid form; its particles, or\r\nmolecules, as they are called, begin to deposit themselves as minute\r\nsolids--so minute, indeed, as to defy all microscopic power.  As\r\nevaporation continues, solidification goes on, and we finally obtain,\r\nthrough the clustering together of innumerable molecules, a finite\r\ncrystalline mass of a definite form.  What is this form?  It sometimes\r\nseems a mimicry of the architecture of Egypt.  We have little pyramids\r\nbuilt by the salt, terrace above terrace from base to apex, forming a\r\nseries of steps resembling those up which the traveller in Egypt is\r\ndragged by his guides.  The human mind is as little disposed to look\r\nwithout questioning at these pyramidal salt-crystals, as to look at\r\nthe pyramids of Egypt, without enquiring whence they came.  How, then,\r\nare those salt-pyramids built up?\r\n\r\nGuided by analogy, you may, if you like, suppose that, swarming among\r\nthe constituent molecules of the salt, there is an invisible\r\npopulation, controlled and coerced by some invisible master, placing\r\nthe atomic blocks in their positions.  This, however, is not the\r\nscientific idea, nor do I think your good sense will accept it as a\r\nlikely one.  The scientific idea is, that the molecules act upon each\r\nother without the intervention of slave labour; that they attract each\r\nother, and repel each other, at certain definite points, or poles, and\r\nin certain definite directions; and that the pyramidal form is the\r\nresult of this play of attraction and repulsion.  While, then, the\r\nblocks of Egypt were laid down by a power external to themselves,\r\nthese molecular blocks of salt are self-posited, being fixed in their\r\nplaces by the inherent forces with which they act upon each other.\r\n\r\nI take common salt as an illustration, because it is so familiar to us\r\nall; but any other crystalline substance would answer my purpose\r\nequally well.  Everywhere, in fact, throughout inorganic nature, we\r\nhave this formative power, as Fichte would call it--this structural\r\nenergy ready to come into play, and build the ultimate particles of\r\nmatter into definite shapes.  The ice of our winters, and of our polar\r\nregions, is its handiwork, and so also are the quartz, felspar, and\r\nmica of our rocks.  Our chalk-beds are for the most part composed of\r\nminute shells, which are also the product of structural energy; but\r\nbehind the shell, as a whole, lies a more remote and subtle formative\r\nact.  These shells are built up of little crystals of talc-spar, and,\r\nto form these crystals, the structural force had to deal with the\r\nintangible molecules of carbonate of lime.  This tendency on the part\r\nof matter to organise itself, to grow into shape, to assume definite\r\nforms in obedience to the definite action of force, is, as I have\r\nsaid, all-pervading.  It is in the ground on which you tread, in the\r\nwater you drink, in the air you breathe.  Incipient life, as it were,\r\nmanifests itself throughout the whole of what we call inorganic\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe forms of the minerals resulting from this play of polar forces are\r\nvarious, and exhibit different degrees of complexity.  Men of science\r\navail themselves of all possible means of exploring their molecular\r\narchitecture.  For this purpose they employ in turn, as agents of\r\nexploration, light, heat, magnetism, electricity, and sound. Polarised\r\nlight is especially useful and powerful here.  A beam of such light,\r\nwhen sent in among the molecules of a crystal, is acted on by them,\r\nand from this action we infer with more or less clearness the manner\r\nin which the molecules are arranged.  That differences, for example,\r\nexist between the inner structure of rocksalt and that of crystallised\r\nsugar or sugar-candy, is thus strikingly revealed.  These actions\r\noften display themselves in chromatic phenomena of great splendour,\r\nthe play of molecular force being so regulated as to cause the removal\r\nof some of the coloured constituents of white light, while others are\r\nleft with increased intensity behind.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us pass from what we are accustomed to regard as a dead\r\nmineral, to a living grain of corn.  When this is examined by\r\npolarised light, chromatic phenomena similar to those noticed in\r\ncrystals are observed.  And why?  Because the architecture of the\r\ngrain resembles that of the crystal.  In the grain also the molecules\r\nare set in definite positions, and in accordance with their\r\narrangement they act upon the light.  But what has built together the\r\nmolecules of the corn?  Regarding crystalline architecture, I have\r\nalready said that you may, if you please, consider the atoms and\r\nmolecules to be placed in position by a Power external to themselves.\r\nThe same hypothesis is open to you now.  But if in the case of\r\ncrystals you have rejected this notion of an external architect, I\r\nthink you are bound to reject it in the case of the grain, and to\r\nconclude that the molecules of the corn, also, are posited by the\r\nforces with which they act upon each other.  It would be poor\r\nphilosophy to invoke an external agent in the one case, and to reject\r\nit in the other.\r\n\r\nInstead of cutting our grain of corn into slices and subjecting it to\r\nthe action of polarised light, let us place it in the earth, and\r\nsubject it to a certain degree of warmth.  In other words, let the\r\nmolecules, both of the corn and of the surrounding earth, be kept in\r\nthat state of agitation which we call heat.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, the grain and the substances which surround it\r\ninteract, and a definite molecular architecture is the result.  A bud\r\nis formed; this bud reaches the surface, where it is exposed to the\r\nsun's rays, which are also to be regarded as a kind of vibratory\r\nmotion.  And as the motion of common heat, with which the grain and\r\nthe substances surrounding it were first endowed, enabled the grain\r\nand these substances to exercise their mutual attractions and\r\nrepulsions, and thus to coalesce in definite forms, so the specific\r\nmotion of the sun's rays now enables the green bud to feed upon the\r\ncarbonic acid and the aqueous vapour of the air.  The bud appropriates\r\nthose constituents of both for which it has an elective attraction,\r\nand permits the other constituent to return to the atmosphere.  Thus\r\nthe architecture is carried on.  Forces are active at the root, forces\r\nare active in the blade, the matter of the air and the matter of the\r\natmosphere are drawn upon, and the plant augments in size.  We have in\r\nsuccession the stalk, the ear, the full corn in the ear; the cycle of\r\nmolecular action being completed by the production of grains, similar\r\nto that with which the process began.\r\n\r\nNow there is nothing in this process which necessarily eludes the\r\nconceptive or imagining power of the human mind.  An intellect the\r\nsame in kind as our own would, if only sufficiently expanded, be able\r\nto follow the whole process from beginning to end.  It would see every\r\nmolecule placed in its position by the specific attractions and\r\nrepulsions exerted between it and other molecules, the whole process,\r\nand its consummation, being an instance of the play of molecular\r\nforce.  Given the grain and its environment, with their respective\r\nforces, the purely human intellect might, if sufficiently expanded,\r\ntrace out _à priori_ every step of the process of growth, and, by the\r\napplication of purely mechanical principles, demonstrate that the\r\ncycle must end, as it is seen to end, in the reproduction of forms\r\nlike that with which it began.  A necessity rules here, similar to\r\nthat which rules the planets in their circuits round the sun.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that I am stating the truth strongly, as at the\r\nbeginning we agreed it should be stated.  But I must go still further,\r\nand affirm that in the eye of science the animal body is just as much\r\nthe product of molecular force as the chalk and the ear of corn, or as\r\nthe crystal of salt or sugar.  Many of the parts of the body are\r\nobviously mechanical.  Take the human heart, for example, with its\r\nsystem of valves, or take the exquisite mechanism of the eye or hand.\r\nAnimal heat, moreover, is the same in kind as the heat of a fire,\r\nbeing produced by the same chemical process.  Animal motion, too, is\r\nas certainly derived from the food of the animal, as the motion of\r\nTrevethyck's walking-engine from the fuel in its furnace.  As regards\r\nmatter, the animal body creates nothing; as regards force, it creates\r\nnothing.  Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his\r\nstature?  All that has been said, then, regarding the plant, may be\r\nrestated with regard to the animal.  Every particle that enters into\r\nthe composition of a nerve, a muscle, or a bone, has been placed in\r\nits position by molecular force.  And unless the existence of law in\r\nthese matters be denied, and the element of caprice introduced, we\r\nmust conclude that, given the relation of any molecule of the body to\r\nits environment, its position in the body might be determined\r\nmathematically.  Our difficulty is not with the _quality_ of the\r\nproblem, but with its _complexity_; and this difficulty might be met by\r\nthe simple expansion of the faculties we now possess.  Given this\r\nexpansion, with the necessary molecular data, and the chick might be\r\ndeduced as rigorously and as logically from the egg, as the existence\r\nof Neptune from the disturbances of Uranus, or as conical refraction\r\nfrom the undulatory theory of light.\r\n\r\nYou see I am not mincing matters, but avowing nakedly what many\r\nscientific thinkers more or less distinctly believe.  The formation of\r\na crystal, a plant, or an animal, is, in their eyes, a purely\r\nmechanical problem, which differs from the problems of ordinary\r\nmechanics, in the smallness of the masses, and the complexity of the\r\nprocesses involved.  Here you have one half of our dual truth; let us\r\nnow glance at the other half.  Associated with this wonderful\r\nmechanism of the animal body we have phenomena no less certain than\r\nthose of physics, but between which and the mechanism we discern no\r\nnecessary connection.  A man, for example, can say 'I feel,' 'I\r\nthink,' 'I love;' but how does consciousness infuse itself into the\r\nproblem?  The human brain is said to be the organ of thought and\r\nfeeling: when we are hurt, the brain feels it; when we ponder, or when\r\nour passions or affections are excited, it is through the\r\ninstrumentality of the brain.  Let us endeavour to be a little more\r\nprecise here.  I hardly imagine there exists a profound scientific\r\nthinker, who has reflected upon the subject, unwilling to admit the\r\nextreme probability of the hypothesis, that for every fact of\r\nconsciousness, whether in the domain of sense, thought, or emotion, a\r\ndefinite molecular condition, of motion or structure, is set up in the\r\nbrain; or who would be disposed even to deny that if the motion, or\r\nstructure, be induced by internal causes instead of external, the\r\neffect on consciousness will be the same?  Let any nerve, for example,\r\nbe thrown by morbid action into the precise state of motion which\r\nwould be communicated to it by the pulses of a heated body, surely\r\nthat nerve will declare itself hot--the mind will accept the\r\nsubjective intimation exactly as if it were objective.  The retina may\r\nbe excited by purely mechanical means.  A blow on the eye causes a\r\nluminous flash, and the mere pressure of the finger on the external\r\nball produces a star of light, which Newton compared to the circles on\r\na peacock's tail.  Disease makes people see visions and dream dreams;\r\nbut, in all such cases, could we examine the organs implicated, we\r\nshould, on philosophical grounds, expect to find them in that precise\r\nmolecular condition which the real objects, if present, would\r\nsuperinduce.\r\n\r\nThe relation of physics to consciousness being thus invariable, it\r\nfollows that, given the state of the brain, the corresponding thought\r\nor feeling might be inferred: or, given the thought or feeling, the\r\ncorresponding state of the brain might be inferred.  But how inferred?\r\nIt would be at bottom not a case of logical inference at all, but of\r\nempirical association.  You may reply, that many of the inferences of\r\nscience are of this character--the inference, for example, that an\r\nelectric current, of a given direction, will deflect a magnetic needle\r\nin a definite way.  But the cases differ in this, that the passage\r\nfrom the current to the needle, if not demonstrable, is conceivable,\r\nand that we entertain no doubt as to the final mechanical solution of\r\nthe problem.  But the passage from the physics of the brain to the\r\ncorresponding facts of consciousness is inconceivable as a result of\r\nmechanics.  Granted that a definite thought, and a definite molecular\r\naction in the brain, occur simultaneously; we do not possess the\r\nintellectual organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which\r\nwould enable us to pass, by a process of reasoning, from the one to\r\nthe other.  They appear together, but we do not know why.  Were our\r\nminds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to\r\nenable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain; were we\r\ncapable of following all their motions, all their groupings, all their\r\nelectric discharges, if such there be; and were we intimately\r\nacquainted with the corresponding states of thought and feeling, we\r\nshould be as far as ever from the solution of the problem, 'How are\r\nthese physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness?'\r\nThe chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain\r\nintellectually impassable.  Let the consciousness of love, for\r\nexample, be associated with a right-handed spiral motion of the\r\nmolecules of the brain, and the consciousness of hate with a\r\nleft-handed spiral motion.  We should then know, when we love, that\r\nthe motion is in one direction, and, when we hate, that the motion is\r\nin the other; but the WHY?' would remain as unanswerable as before.\r\n\r\nIn affirming that the growth of the body is mechanical, and that\r\nthought, as exercised by us, has its correlative in the physics of the\r\nbrain, I think the position of the 'Materialist' is stated, as far as\r\nthat position is a tenable one.  I think the materialist will be able\r\nfinally to maintain this position against all attacks; but I do not\r\nthink, in the present condition of the human mind, that he can pass\r\nbeyond this position.  I do not think he is entitled to say that his\r\nmolecular groupings, and motions, explain everything.\r\n\r\nIn reality they explain nothing.  The utmost he can affirm is the\r\nassociation of two classes of phenomena, of whose real bond of union\r\nhe is in absolute ignorance.  The problem of the connection of body\r\nand soul is as insoluble, in its modern form, as it was in the\r\nprescientific ages.  Phosphorus is known to enter into the composition\r\nof the human brain, and a trenchant German writer has exclaimed, 'Ohne\r\nPhosphor, kein Gedanke!' That may or may not be the case; but even if\r\nwe knew it to be the case, the knowledge would not lighten our\r\ndarkness.  On both sides of the zone here assigned to the materialist\r\nhe is equally helpless.  If you ask him whence is this 'Matter' of\r\nwhich we have been discoursing--who or what divided it into molecules,\r\nwho or what impressed upon them this necessity of running into organic\r\nforms--he has no answer.  Science is mute in reply to these questions.\r\nBut if the materialist is confounded and science rendered dumb, who\r\nelse is prepared with a solution?  To whom has this arm of the Lord\r\nbeen revealed?  Let us lower our heads, and acknowledge our ignorance,\r\npriest and philosopher, one and all.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the mystery may resolve itself into knowledge at some future\r\nday.  The process of things upon this earth has been one of\r\namelioration.  It is a long way from the Iguanodon and his\r\ncontemporaries, to the President and Members of the British\r\nAssociation.  And whether we regard the improvement from the\r\nscientific or from the theological point of view--as the result of\r\nprogressive development, or of successive exhibitions of creative\r\nenergy--neither view entitles us to assume that man's present\r\nfaculties end the series, that the process of amelioration ends with\r\nhim.  A time may therefore come when this ultra-scientific region, by\r\nwhich we are now enfolded, may offer itself to terrestrial, if not to\r\nhuman, investigation.  Two-thirds of the rays emitted by the sun fail\r\nto arouse the sense of vision.  The rays exist, but the visual organ\r\nrequisite for their translation into light does not exist.  And so\r\nfrom this region of darkness and mystery which surrounds us, rays may\r\nnow be darting, which require but the development of the proper\r\nintellectual organs to translate them into knowledge as far surpassing\r\nOurs, as ours surpasses that of the wallowing reptiles, which once\r\nheld possession of this planet.  Meanwhile the mystery is not without\r\nits uses.  It certainly may made a power in the human soul; but it is\r\na power which has feeling, not knowledge, for its base.  It may be,\r\nwill be, and I hope is turned to account, both in steadying and\r\nstrengthening intellect, and in; rescuing man from that littleness to\r\nwhich, in the struggle for existence, or for precedence in the world,\r\nhe is continually prone.\r\n\r\n__________________\r\n\r\nMusings on the Matterhorn, July 27, 1868.\r\n\r\nHacked and hurt by time, the aspect of the mountain from its higher\r\ncrags saddened me.  Hitherto the impression it made was that of savage\r\nstrength; here we had inexorable decay.  But this notion of decay\r\nimplied a reference to a period when the Matterhorn was in the full\r\nstrength of mountainhood.  Thought naturally ran back to its remoter\r\norigin and sculpture.  Nor did thought halt there, but wandered on\r\nthrough molten worlds to that nebulous haze which philosophers have\r\nregarded, and with good reason, as the proximate source of all\r\nmaterial things.  I tried to look at this universal cloud, containing\r\nwithin itself the prediction of all that has since occurred; I tried\r\nto imagine it as the seat of those forces whose action was to issue in\r\nsolar and stellar systems, and all that they involve.  Did that\r\nformless fog contain potentially the _sadness_ with which I regarded the\r\nMatterhorn?  Did the _thought_ which now ran back to it simply return to\r\nits primeval home?  If so, had we not better recast our definitions of\r\nmatter and force; for, if life and thought be the very flower of both,\r\nany definition which omits life and thought must be inadequate, if not\r\nuntrue.  Are questions like these warranted?  Why not?  If the final\r\ngoal of man has not been yet attained; if his development has not been\r\nyet arrested, who can say that such yearnings and questionings are not\r\nnecessary to the opening of a finer vision, to the budding and the\r\ngrowth of diviner powers?  When I look at the heavens and the earth,\r\nat my own body, at my strength and weakness, even at these ponderings,\r\nand ask myself, Is there no being or thing in the universe that knows\r\nmore about these matters than I do; what is my answer?  Supposing our\r\ntheologic schemes of creation, condemnation, and redemption to be\r\ndissipated; and the warmth of denial which they excite, and which, as\r\na motive force, can match the warmth of affirmation, dissipated at the\r\nsame time; would the undeflected human mind return to the meridian of\r\nabsolute neutrality as regards these ultra-physical questions?  Is\r\nsuch a position one of stable equilibrium?  The channels of thought\r\nbeing already formed, such are the questions, without replies, which\r\ncould run athwart consciousness during a ten minutes' halt upon the\r\nweathered crest of the Matterhorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n\r\n  Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,\r\n  These three alone lead life to sovereign power.\r\n  Yet not for power (power of herself\r\n  Would come uncalled for), but to live by law,\r\n  Acting the law we live by without fear;\r\n  And, because right is right, to follow right\r\n  Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.\r\n\r\n                          TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nVII.  AN ADDRESS TO STUDENTS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Delivered at University College, London, Session 1968-69.]\r\n\r\nTHERE is an idea regarding the nature of man which modern philosophy\r\nhas sought, and is still seeking, to raise into clearness; the idea,\r\nnamely, of secular growth.  Man is not a thing of yesterday; nor do I\r\nimagine that the slightest controversial tinge is imported into this\r\naddress when I say that he is not a thing of 6,000 years ago.  Whether\r\nhe came originally from stocks or stones, from nebulous gas or solar\r\nfire, I know not; if he had any such origin the process of his\r\ntransformation is as inscrutable to you and me as that of the grand\r\nold legend, according to which 'the Lord God formed man of the dust of\r\nthe ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man\r\nbecame a living soul.' But however obscure man's origin may be, his\r\ngrowth is not to be denied.  Here a little and there a little added\r\nthrough the ages have slowly transformed him from what he was into\r\nwhat he is.  The doctrine has been held that the mind of the child is\r\nlike a sheet of white paper, on which by education we can write what\r\ncharacters we please.  This doctrine assuredly needs qualification and\r\ncorrection.  In physics, when an external force is applied to a body\r\nwith a view of affecting its inner texture, if we wish to predict the\r\nresult, we must know whether the external force conspires with or\r\nopposes the internal forces of the body itself; and in bringing the\r\ninfluence of education to bear upon the new-born man his inner powers\r\nalso must be taken into account.  He comes to us as a bundle of\r\ninherited capacities and tendencies, labelled 'from the indefinite\r\npast to the indefinite future;' and he makes his transit from the one\r\nto the other through the education of the present time.  The object of\r\nthat education is, or ought to be, to provide wise exercise for his\r\ncapacities, wise direction for his tendencies, and through this\r\nexercise and this direction to furnish his mind with such knowledge as\r\nmay contribute to the usefulness, the beauty, and the nobleness of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHow is this discipline to be secured, this knowledge imparted?  Two\r\nrival methods now solicit attention,--the one organised and equipped,\r\nthe labour of centuries having been expended in bringing it to its\r\npresent state of perfection; the other, more or less chaotic, but\r\nbecoming daily less so, and giving signs of enormous power, both as a\r\nsource of knowledge and as a means of discipline.  These two methods\r\nare the classical and the scientific method.  I wish they were not\r\nrivals; it is only bigotry and short-sightedness that make them so;\r\nfor assuredly it is possible to give both of them fair play.  Though\r\nhardly authorised to express an opinion upon the subject, I\r\nnevertheless hold the opinion that the proper study of a language is\r\nan intellectual discipline of the highest kind.  If I except\r\ndiscussions on the comparative merits of Popery and Protestantism,\r\nEnglish grammar was the most important discipline of my boyhood.  The\r\npiercing through the involved and inverted sentences of 'Paradise\r\nLost'; the linking of the verb to its often distant nominative, of the\r\nrelative to its distant antecedent, of the agent to the object of the\r\ntransitive verb, of the preposition to the noun or pronoun which it\r\ngoverned, the study of variations in mood and tense, the\r\ntranspositions often necessary to bring out the true grammatical\r\nstructure of a sentence--all this was to my young mind a discipline of\r\nthe highest value, and a source of unflagging delight.  How I rejoiced\r\nwhen I found a great author tripping, and was fairly able to pin him\r\nto a corner from which there was no escape!  As I speak, some of the\r\nsentences which exercised me when a boy rise to my recollection.  For\r\ninstance, 'He that hath ears to hear, let him hear;' where the 'He'\r\nis left, as it were, floating in mid air without any verb to support\r\nit.  I speak thus of English because it was of real value to me.  I do\r\nnot speak of other languages because their educational value for me\r\nwas almost insensible.  But knowing the value of English so well, I\r\nshould be the last to deny, or even to doubt, the high discipline\r\ninvolved in the proper study of Latin and Greek.\r\n\r\nThat study, moreover, has other merits and recommendations.  It is, as\r\nI have said, organised and systematised by long-continued use.  It is\r\nan instrument wielded by some of our best intellects in the education\r\nof youth; and it can point to results in the achievements of our\r\nforemost men.  What, then, has science to offer which is in the least\r\ndegree likely to compete with such a system?  I cannot better reply\r\nthan by recurring to the grand old story from which I have already\r\nquoted.  Speaking of the world and all that therein is, of the sky and\r\nthe stars around it, the ancient writer says, 'And God saw all that\r\nhe had made, and behold it was very good.' It is the body of things\r\nthus described which science offers to the study of man.  There is a\r\nvery renowned argument much prized and much quoted by theologians, in\r\nwhich the universe is compared to a watch.  Let us deal practically\r\nwith this comparison.  Supposing a watchmaker, having completed his\r\ninstrument, to be so satisfied with his work as to call it very good,\r\nwhat would you understand him to mean?  You would not suppose that he\r\nreferred to the dial-plate in front and the chasing of the case\r\nbehind, so much as to the wheels and pinions, the springs and jewelled\r\npivots of the works within--to those qualities and powers, in short,\r\nwhich enable the watch to perform its work as a keeper of time.  With\r\nregard to the knowledge of such a watch he would be a mere ignoramus\r\nwho would content himself with outward inspection.  I do not wish to\r\nsay one severe word here to-day, but I fear that many of those who are\r\nvery loud in their praise of the works of the Lord know them only in\r\nthis outside and superficial way.  It is the inner works of the\r\nuniverse which science reverently uncovers; it is the study of these\r\nthat she recommends as a discipline worthy of all acceptation.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate problem of physics is to reduce matter by analysis to its\r\nlowest condition of divisibility, and force to its simplest\r\nmanifestations, and then by synthesis to construct from these elements\r\nthe world as it stands.  We are still a long way from the final\r\nsolution of this problem; and when the solution comes, it will be more\r\none of spiritual insight than of actual observation.  But though we\r\nare still a long way from this complete intellectual mastery of\r\nnature, we have conquered vast regions of it, have learned their\r\npolities and the play of their powers.  We live upon a ball of 8,000\r\nmiles in diameter, swathed by an atmosphere of unknown height.  This\r\nball has been molten by heat, chilled to a solid, and sculptured by\r\nwater.  It is made up of substances possessing distinctive properties\r\nand modes of action, which offer problems to the intellect, some\r\nprofitable to the child, others taxing the highest powers of the\r\nphilosopher.  Our native sphere turns on its axis, and revolves in\r\nspace.  It is one of a band which all do the same.  It is illuminated\r\nby a sun which, though nearly a hundred millions of miles distant, can\r\nbe brought virtually into our closets and there subjected to\r\nexamination.  It has its winds and clouds, its rain and frost, its\r\nlight, heat, sound, electricity, and magnetism.  And it has its vast\r\nkingdoms of animals and vegetables.  To a most amazing extent the\r\nhuman mind has conquered these things, and revealed the logic which\r\nruns through them.  Were they facts only, without logical\r\nrelationship, science might, as a means of discipline, suffer in\r\ncomparison with language.  But the whole body of phenomena is instinct\r\nwith law; the facts are hung on principles, and the value of physical\r\nscience as a means of discipline consists in the motion of the\r\nintellect, both inductively and deductively, along the lines of law\r\nmarked out by phenomena.  As regards the discipline to which I have\r\nalready referred as derivable from the study of languages,--that, and\r\nmore, is involved in the study of physical science.  Indeed, I believe\r\nit would be possible so to limit and arrange the study of a portion of\r\nphysics as to render the mental exercise involved in it almost\r\nqualitatively the same as that involved in the unravelling of a\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nI have thus far confined myself to the purely intellectual side of\r\nthis question.  But man is not all intellect.  If he were so, science\r\nwould, I believe, be his proper nutriment.  But he feels as well as\r\nthinks; he is receptive of the sublime and beautiful as well as of the\r\ntrue.  Indeed, I believe that even the intellectual action of a\r\ncomplete man is, consciously or unconsciously, sustained by an\r\nundercurrent of the emotions.  It is vain to attempt to separate the\r\nmoral and emotional from the intellectual.  Let a man but observe\r\nhimself, and he will, if I mistake not, find that in nine cases out of\r\nten, the emotions constitute the motive force which pushes his\r\nintellect into action.  The reading of the works of two men, neither\r\nof them imbued with the spirit of modern science--neither of them,\r\nindeed, friendly to that spirit--has placed me here to-day.  These men\r\nare the English Carlyle and the American Emerson.  I must ever\r\ngratefully remember that through three long cold German winters\r\nCarlyle placed me in my tub, even when ice was on its surface, at five\r\no'clock every morning--not slavishly, but cheerfully, meeting each\r\nday's studies with a resolute will, determined whether victor or\r\nvanquished not to shrink from difficulty.  I never should have gone\r\nthrough Analytical Geometry and the Calculus had it not been for those\r\nmen.  I never should have become a physical investigator, and hence\r\nwithout them I should not have been here to-day.  They told me what I\r\nought to do in a way that caused me to do it, and all my consequent\r\nintellectual action is to be traced to this purely moral source.  To\r\nCarlyle and Emerson I ought to add Fichte, the greatest representative\r\nof pure idealism.  These three unscientific men made me a practical\r\nscientific worker.  They called out 'Act!'  I hearkened to the\r\nsummons, taking the liberty, however, of determining for myself the\r\ndirection which effort was to take.\r\n\r\nAnd I may now cry 'Act!' but the potency of action must be yours.  I\r\nmay pull the trigger, but if the gun be not charged there is no\r\nresult.  We are creators in the intellectual world as little as in the\r\nphysical.  We may remove obstacles, and render latent capacities\r\nactive, but we cannot suddenly change the nature of man.  The 'new\r\nbirth' itself implies the pre-existence of a character which requires\r\nnot to be created but brought forth.  You cannot by any amount of\r\nmissionary labour suddenly transform the savage into the civilised\r\nChristian.  The improvement of man is _secular_--not the work of an hour\r\nor of a day.  But though indubitably bound by our organisations, no\r\nman knows what the potentialities of any human mind may be, requiring\r\nonly release to be brought into action.  There are in the mineral\r\nworld certain crystals--certain forms, for instance, of fluor-spar,\r\nwhich have lain darkly in the earth for ages, but which nevertheless\r\nhave a potency of light locked up within them.  In their case the\r\npotential has never become actual--the light is in fact held back by a\r\nmolecular detent.  When these crystals are warmed, the detent is\r\nlifted, and an outflow of light immediately begins.  I know not how\r\nmany of you may be in the condition of this fluor-spar.  For aught I\r\nknow, every one of you may be in this condition, requiring but the\r\nproper agent to be applied--the proper word to be spoken--to remove a\r\ndetent, and to render you conscious of light and warmth within\r\nyourselves and sources of both to others.\r\n\r\nThe circle of human nature, then, is not complete without the arc of\r\nthe emotions.  The lilies of the field have a value for us beyond\r\ntheir botanical ones--a certain lightening of the heart accompanies\r\nthe declaration that 'Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like\r\none of these.' The sound of the village bell has a value beyond its\r\nacoustical one.  The setting sun has a value beyond its optical one.\r\nThe starry heavens, as you know, had for Immanuel Kant a value beyond\r\ntheir astronomical one.  I think it very desirable to keep this\r\nhorizon of the emotions open, and not to permit either priest or\r\nphilosopher to draw down his shutters between you and it.  Here the\r\ndead languages, which are sure to be beaten by science in the purely\r\nintellectual fight, have an irresistible claim.  They supplement the\r\nwork of science by exalting and refining the aesthetic faculty, and\r\nmust on this account be cherished by all who desire to see human\r\nculture complete.  There must be a reason for the fascination which\r\nthese languages have so long exercised upon powerful and elevated\r\nminds--a fascination which will probably continue for men of Greek and\r\nRoman mould to the end of time.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this question one very obvious danger besets many\r\nof the more earnest spirits of our day--the danger of _haste_ in\r\nendeavouring to give the feelings repose.  We are distracted by\r\nsystems of theology and philosophy which were taught to us when young,\r\nand which now excite in us a hunger and a thirst for knowledge not\r\nproved to be attainable.  There are periods when the judgment ought to\r\nremain in suspense, the data on which a decision might be based being\r\nabsent.  This discipline of suspending the judgment is a common one in\r\nscience, but not so common as it ought to be elsewhere.  I walked down\r\nRegent Street some time ago with a man of great gifts and\r\nacquirements, discussing with him various theological questions.  I\r\ncould not accept his views of the origin and destiny of the universe,\r\nnor was I prepared to enunciate any definite views of my own.  He\r\nturned to me at length and said, 'You surely must have a theory of the\r\nuniverse.'  That I should in one way or another have solved this\r\nmystery of mysteries seemed, to my friend a matter of course.  'I have\r\nnot even a theory of magnetism' was my reply.  We ought to learn to\r\nwait.  We ought assuredly to pause before closing with the advances of\r\nthose expounders of the ways of God to men, who offer us intellectual\r\npeace at the modest cost of intellectual life.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of the world ought to be its best men, and for the\r\npresent at all events such men must learn self-trust. By the fullness\r\nand freshness of their own Jives and utterances they must awaken life\r\nin others.  The hopes and terrors which influenced our fathers are\r\npassing away, and our trust henceforth must rest on the innate\r\nstrength of man's moral nature.  And here, I think, the poet will have\r\na great part to play in the future culture of the world.  To him, when\r\nhe rightly understands his mission, and does not flinch from the tonic\r\ndiscipline which it assuredly demands, we have a right to look for\r\nthat heightening and brightening of life which so many of us need.  To\r\nhim it is given for a long time to come to fill those shores which the\r\nrecession of the theologic tide has left exposed.  Void of offence to\r\nscience, he may freely deal with conceptions which science shuns, and\r\nbecome the illustrator and interpreter of that Power which as\r\n\r\n       'Jehovah, Jove, or Lord,'\r\n\r\nhas hitherto filled and strengthened the human heart.\r\n\r\nLet me utter one practical word in conclusion--take care of your\r\nhealth.  There have been men who by wise attention to this point might\r\nhave risen to any eminence--might have made great discoveries, written\r\ngreat poems, commanded armies, or ruled states, but who by unwise\r\nneglect of this point have come to nothing.  Imagine Hercules as\r\noarsman in a rotten boat; what can he do there but by the very force\r\nof his stroke expedite the ruin of his craft?  Take care then of the\r\ntimbers of your boat, and avoid all practices likely to introduce\r\neither wet or dry rot amongst them.  And this is not to be\r\naccomplished by desultory or intermittent efforts of the will, but by\r\nthe formation of _habits_.  The will no doubt has sometimes to put forth\r\nits strength in order to crush the special temptation.  But the\r\nformation of right habits is essential to your permanent security.\r\nThey diminish your chance of falling when assailed, and they augment\r\nyour chance of recovery when overthrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n    If thou would'st know the mystic song\r\n    Chaunted when the sphere was young,\r\n    Aloft, abroad, the paean swells,\r\n    O wise man, hear'st thou half it tells?\r\n    To the open ear it sings\r\n    The early genesis of things;\r\n    Of tendency through endless ages\r\n    Of star-dust and star-pilgrimages,\r\n    Of rounded worlds, of space and time,\r\n    Of the old floods' subsiding slime,\r\n    Of chemic matter, force and form,\r\n    Of poles and powers, cold, wet, and warm.\r\n    The rushing metamorphosis\r\n    Dissolving all that fixture is,\r\n    Melts things that be to things that seem,\r\n    And solid nature to a dream.'\r\n\r\n                                  EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Was waer' ein Gott der nur von aussen stiesse,\r\n    Im Kreis das All am Finger laufen liesse\r\n    Ihm ziemt's, die Welt im Innern zu bewegen,\r\n    Natur in Sich, Sich in Natur zu hegen.'\r\n\r\n                                     GOETHE.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nVIII.  SCIENTIFIC USE OF THE IMAGINATION.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Discourse delivered before the British Association at\r\nLiverpool, September 16, 1870.]\r\n\r\n'Lastly, physical investigation, more than anything besides, helps to\r\nteach us the actual value and right use of the Imagination--of that\r\nwondrous faculty, which, left to ramble uncontrolled, leads us astray\r\ninto a wilderness of perplexities and errors, a land of mists and\r\nshadows; but which, properly controlled by experience and reflection,\r\nbecomes the noblest attribute of man; the source of poetic genius, the\r\ninstrument of discovery in Science, without the aid of which Newton\r\nwould never have invented fluxions, nor Davy have decomposed the\r\nearths and alkalies, nor would Columbus have found another\r\nContinent.'--Address to the Royal Society by its President Sir\r\nBenjamin Brodie, November 30, 1859.\r\n\r\nI carried with me to the Alps this year the burden of this evening's\r\nwork.  Save from memory I had no direct aid upon the mountains; but to\r\nspur up the emotions, on which so much depends, as well as to nourish\r\nindirectly the intellect and will, I took with me four works,\r\ncomprising two volumes of poetry, Goethe's 'Farbenlehre,' and the work\r\non 'Logic' recently published by Mr. Alexander Bain.  In Goethe, so\r\nnoble otherwise, I chiefly noticed the self-inflicted hurts of genius,\r\nas it broke itself in vain against the philosophy of Newton.  Mr. Bain\r\nI found, for the most part, learned and practical, shining generally\r\nwith a dry light, but exhibiting at times a flush of emotional\r\nstrength, which proved that even logicians share the common fire of\r\nhumanity.  He interested me most when he became the mirror of my own\r\ncondition.  Neither intellectually nor socially is it good for man to\r\nbe alone, and the sorrows of thought are more patiently borne when we\r\nfind that they have been experienced by another.  From certain\r\npassages in his book I could infer that Mr. Bain was no stranger to\r\nsuch sorrows.  Speaking for example of the ebb of intellectual force,\r\nwhich we all from time to time experience, Mr. Bain says: 'The\r\nuncertainty where to look for the next opening of discovery brings the\r\npain of conflict and the debility of indecision.' These words have in\r\nthem the true ring of personal experience.  The action of the\r\ninvestigator is periodic.  He grapples with a subject of enquiry,\r\nwrestles with it, and exhausts, it may be, both himself and it for the\r\ntime being.  He breathes a space, and then renews the struggle in\r\nanother field.  Now this period of halting between two investigations\r\nis not always one of pure repose.  It is often a period of doubt and\r\ndiscomfort--of gloom and ennui.  'The uncertainty where to look for\r\nthe next opening of discovery brings the pain of conflict and the\r\ndebility of indecision.' It was under such conditions that I had to\r\nequip myself for the hour and the ordeal that are now come.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe disciplines of common life are, in great part, exercises in the\r\nrelations of space, or in the mental grouping of bodies in space; and,\r\nby such exercises, the public mind is, to some extent, prepared for\r\nthe reception of physical conceptions.  Assuming this preparation on\r\nyour part, the wish gradually grew within me to trace, and to enable\r\nyou to trace, some of the more occult features and operations of Light\r\nand Colour.  I wished, if possible, to take you beyond the boundary of\r\nmere observation, into a region where things are intellectually\r\ndiscerned, and to show you there the hidden mechanism of optical\r\naction.\r\n\r\nBut how are those hidden things to be revealed?  Philosophers may be\r\nright in affirming that we cannot transcend experience: we can, at all\r\nevents, carry it a long way from its origin.  We can magnify,\r\ndiminish, qualify, and combine experiences, so as to render them fit\r\nfor purposes entirely new.  In explaining sensible phenomena, we\r\nhabitually form mental images of the ultra-sensible.  There are Tories\r\neven in science who regard Imagination as a faculty to be feared and\r\navoided rather than employed.  They have observed its action in weak\r\nvessels, and are unduly impressed by its disasters.  But they might\r\nwith equal justice point to exploded boilers as an argument against\r\nthe use of steam.  With accurate experiment and observation to work\r\nupon, Imagination becomes the architect of physical theory.  Newton's\r\npassage from a falling apple to a falling moon was an act of the\r\nprepared imagination, without which the 'laws of Kepler' could never\r\nhave been traced to their foundations.  Out of the facts of chemistry\r\nthe constructive imagination of Dalton formed the atomic theory.  Davy\r\nwas richly endowed with the imaginative faculty, while with Faraday\r\nits exercise was incessant, preceding, accompanying and guiding all\r\nhis experiments.  His strength and fertility as a discoverer is to be\r\nreferred in great part to the stimulus of his imagination.  Scientific\r\nmen fight shy of the word because of its ultra-scientific\r\nconnotations; but the fact is that without the exercise of this power,\r\nour knowledge of nature would be a mere tabulation of co-existences\r\nand sequences.  We should still believe in the succession of day and\r\nnight, of summer and winter; but the conception of Force would vanish\r\nfrom our universe; causal relations would disappear, and with them\r\nthat science which is now binding the parts of nature to an organic\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nI should like to illustrate by a few simple instances the use that\r\nscientific men have already made of this power of imagination, and to\r\nindicate afterwards some of the further uses that they are likely to\r\nmake of it.  Let us begin with the rudimentary experiences.  Observe\r\nthe falling of heavy rain-drops into a tranquil pond.  Each drop as it\r\nstrikes the water becomes a centre of disturbance, from which a series\r\nof ring-ripples expand outwards.  Gravity and inertia are the agents\r\nby which this wave-motion is produced, and a rough experiment will\r\nsuffice to show that the rate of propagation does not amount to a foot\r\na second.  A series of slight mechanical shocks is experienced by a\r\nbody plunged in the water, as the wavelets reach it in succession. But\r\na finer motion is at the same time set up and propagated.  If the head\r\nand ears be immersed in the water, as in an experiment of Franklin's,\r\nthe tick of the drop is heard.  Now, this sonorous impulse is\r\npropagated, not at the rate of a foot, but at the rate of 4,700 feet a\r\nsecond.  In this case it is not the gravity but the elasticity of the\r\nwater that comes into play.  Every liquid particle pushed against its\r\nneighbour delivers up its motion with extreme rapidity, and the pulse\r\nis propagated as a thrill.  The incompressibility of water, as\r\nillustrated by the famous Florentine experiment, is a measure of its\r\nelasticity; and to the possession of this property, in so high a\r\ndegree, the rapid transmission of a sound-pulse through water is to be\r\nascribed.\r\n\r\nBut water, as you know, is not necessary to the conduction of sound;\r\nair is its most common vehicle.  And you know that when the air\r\npossesses the particular density and elasticity corresponding to the\r\ntemperature of freezing water, the velocity of sound in it is 1,090\r\nfeet a second.  It is almost exactly one-fourth of the velocity in\r\nwater; the reason being that though the greater weight of the water\r\ntends to diminish the velocity, the enormous molecular elasticity of\r\nthe liquid far more than atones for the disadvantage due to weight. By\r\nvarious contrivances we can compel the vibrations of the air to\r\ndeclare themselves we know the length and frequency of the sonorous\r\nwaves, and we have also obtained great mastery over the various\r\nmethods by which the air is thrown into vibration.  We know the\r\nphenomena and laws of vibrating rods, of organ-pipes, strings,\r\nmembranes, plates, and bells.  We can abolish one sound by another. We\r\nknow the physical meaning of music and noise, of harmony and discord.\r\nIn short, as regards sound in general, we have a very clear notion of\r\nthe external physical processes which correspond to our sensations.\r\n\r\nIn the phenomena of sound, we travel a very little way from downright\r\nsensible experience.  Still the imagination is to some extent\r\nexercised.  The bodily eye, for example, cannot see the condensations\r\nand rarefactions of the waves of sound.  We construct them in thought,\r\nand we believe as firmly in their existence as in that of the air\r\nitself.  But now our experience is to be carried into a new region,\r\nwhere a new use is to be made of it.  Having mastered the cause and\r\nmechanism of sound, we desire to know the cause and mechanism of\r\nlight.  We wish to extend our enquiries from the auditory to the optic\r\nnerve.  There is in the human intellect a power of expansion--I might\r\nalmost call it a power of creation--which is brought into play by the\r\nsimple brooding upon facts.  The legend of the spirit brooding over\r\nchaos may have originated in experience of this power.  In the case\r\nnow before us it has manifested itself by transplanting into space,\r\nfor the purposes of light, an adequately modified form of the\r\nmechanism of sound.  We know intimately whereon the velocity of sound\r\ndepends.  When we lessen the density of the aerial medium, and\r\npreserve its elasticity constant, we augment the velocity.  When we\r\nheighten the elasticity, and keep the density constant, we also\r\naugment the velocity.  A small density, therefore, and a great\r\nelasticity, are the two things necessary to rapid propagation.  Now\r\nlight is known to move with the astounding velocity of 186,000 miles a\r\nsecond.  How is such a velocity to be obtained?  By boldly diffusing\r\nin space a medium of the requisite tenuity and elasticity.\r\n\r\nLet us make such a medium our starting-point, and, endowing it with\r\none or two other necessary qualities, let us handle it in accordance\r\nwith strict mechanical laws.  Let us then carry our results from the\r\nworld of theory into the world of sense, and see whether our\r\ndeductions do not issue in the very phenomena of light which ordinary\r\nknowledge and skilled experiment reveal.  If in all the multiplied\r\nvarieties of these phenomena, including those of the most remote and\r\nentangled description, this fundamental conception always brings us\r\nface to face with the truth; if no contradiction to our deductions\r\nfrom it be found in external nature, but on all sides agreement and\r\nverification; if, moreover, as in the case of Conical Refraction and\r\nin other cases, it actually forces upon our attention phenomena which\r\nno eye had previously seen, and which no mind had previously\r\nimagined--such a conception, must, we think, be something more than a\r\nmere figment of the scientific fancy.  In forming it, that composite\r\nand creative power, in which reason and imagination are united, has,\r\nwe believe, led us into a world not less real than that of the senses,\r\nand of which the world of sense itself is the suggestion and, to a\r\ngreat extent, the outcome.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me, however, to wish to fix you immovably in this or in\r\nany other theoretic conception.  With all our belief of it, it will be\r\nwell to keep the theory of a luminiferous aether plastic and capable\r\nof change.  You may, moreover, urge that, although the phenomena occur\r\n_as if_ the medium existed, the absolute demonstration of its existence\r\nis still wanting.  Far be it from me to deny to this reasoning such\r\nvalidity as it may fairly claim.  Let us endeavour by means of analogy\r\nto form a fair estimate of its force.  You believe that in society you\r\nare surrounded by reasonable beings like yourself.  You are, perhaps,\r\nas firmly convinced of this as of anything.  What is your warrant for\r\nthis conviction?  Simply and solely this: your fellow-creatures behave\r\nas if they were reasonable; the hypothesis, for it is nothing more,\r\naccounts for the facts.  To take an eminent example: you believe that\r\nour President is a reasonable being.  Why?  There is no known method\r\nof superposition by which any one of us can apply himself\r\nintellectually to any other, so as to demonstrate coincidence as\r\nregards the possession of reason.  If, therefore, you hold our\r\nPresident to be reasonable, it is because he behaves _as if_ he were\r\nreasonable.  As in the case of the aether, beyond the _'as if'_ you\r\ncannot go.  Nay, I should not wonder if a close comparison of the data\r\non which both inferences rest, caused many respectable persons to\r\nconclude that the aether had the best of it.\r\n\r\nThis universal medium, this light-aether as it is called, is the\r\nvehicle, not the origin, of wave-motion.  It receives and transmits,\r\nbut it does not create.  Whence does it derive the motions it conveys?\r\nFor the most part from luminous bodies.  By the motion of a luminous\r\nbody I do not mean its sensible motion, such as the flicker of a\r\ncandle, or the shooting out of red prominences from the limb of the\r\nsun.  I mean an intestine motion of the atoms or molecules of the\r\nluminous body.  But here a certain reserve is necessary.  Many\r\nchemists of the present day refuse to speak of atoms and molecules as\r\nreal things.  Their caution leads them to stop short of the clear,\r\nsharp, mechanically intelligible atomic theory enunciated by Dalton,\r\nor any form of that theory, and to make the doctrine of 'multiple\r\nproportions' their intellectual bourne.  I respect the caution, though\r\nI think it is here misplaced.  The chemists who recoil from these\r\nnotions of atoms and molecules accept, without hesitation, the\r\nUndulatory Theory of Light.  Like you and me they one and all believe\r\nin an aether and its light-producing waves.  Let us consider what this\r\nbelief involves.  Bring your imaginations once more into play, and\r\nfigure a series of sound-waves passing through air.  Follow them up to\r\ntheir origin, and what do you there find?  A definite, tangible,\r\nvibrating body.  It may be the vocal chords of a human being, it may\r\nbe an organ-pipe, or it may be a stretched string.  Follow in the same\r\nmanner a train of aether-waves to their source; remembering at the\r\nsame time that your aether is matter, dense, elastic, and capable of\r\nmotions subject to, and determined by, mechanical laws.  What then do\r\nyou expect to find as the source of a series of aether-waves?  Ask\r\nyour imagination if it will accept a vibrating multiple proportion--a\r\nnumerical ratio in a state of oscillation?  I do not think it will.\r\nYou cannot crown the edifice with this abstraction.  The scientific\r\nimagination, which is here authoritative, demands, as the origin and\r\ncause of a series of aether-waves, a particle of vibrating matter\r\nquite as definite, though it may be excessively minute, as that which\r\ngives origin to a musical sound.  Such a particle we name an atom or a\r\nmolecule.  I think the intellect, when focussed so as to give\r\ndefinition without penumbral haze, is sure to realise this image at\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the view of preserving thought continuous throughout this\r\ndiscourse, and of preventing either failure of knowledge or of memory,\r\nfrom causing any rent in our picture, I here propose to run rapidly\r\nover a bit of ground which is probably familiar to most of you, but\r\nwhich I am anxious to make familiar to you all.  The waves generated\r\nin the aether by the swinging atoms of luminous bodies are of\r\ndifferent lengths and amplitudes.  The amplitude is the width of swing\r\nof the individual particles of the waves.  In water-waves it is the\r\nvertical height of the crest above the trough, while the length of the\r\nwave is the horizontal distance between two consecutive crests.  The\r\naggregate of waves emitted by the sun may be broadly divided into two\r\nclasses: the one class competent, the other incompetent, to excite\r\nvision.  But the light-producing waves differ markedly among\r\nthemselves in size, form, and force.  The length of the largest of\r\nthese waves is about twice that of the smallest, but the amplitude of\r\nthe largest is probably a hundred times that of the smallest. Now the\r\nforce or energy of the wave, which, expressed with reference to\r\nsensation, means the intensity of the light, is proportional to the\r\nsquare of the amplitude.  Hence the amplitude being one-hundredfold,\r\nthe energy of the largest light-giving waves would be ten-thousandfold\r\nthat of the smallest. This is not improbable.  I use these figures not\r\nwith a view to numerical accuracy, but to give you definite ideas of\r\nthe differences that probably exist among the light-giving waves.  And\r\nif we take the whole range of solar radiation into account--its\r\nnon-visual as well as its visual waves--I think it probable that the\r\nforce, or energy, of the largest wave is more than a million times\r\nthat of the smallest.\r\n\r\nTurned into their equivalents of sensation, the different light-waves\r\nproduce different colours.  Red, for example, is produced by the\r\nlargest waves, violet by the smallest, while green is produced by a\r\nwave of intermediate length and amplitude.  On entering from air into\r\na more highly refracting substance, such as glass or water, or the\r\nsulphide of carbon, all the waves are retarded, but the smallest ones\r\nmost. This furnishes a means of separating the different classes of\r\nwaves from each other; in other words, of analysing the light.\r\n\r\nSent through a refracting prism, the waves of the sun are turned aside\r\nin different degrees from their direct course, the red least, the\r\nviolet most.  They are virtually pulled asunder, and they paint upon a\r\nwhite screen placed to receive them 'the solar spectrum.'  Strictly\r\nspeaking, the spectrum embraces an infinity of colours; but the limits\r\nof language, and of our powers of distinction, cause it to be divided\r\ninto seven segments: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.\r\nThese are the seven primary or prismatic colours.\r\n\r\nSeparately, or mixed in various proportions, the solar waves yield all\r\nthe colours observed in nature and employed in art.  Collectively,\r\nthey give us the impression of whiteness.  Pure unsifted solar light\r\nis white; and, if all the wave-constituents of such light be reduced\r\nin the same proportion, the light, though diminished in intensity,\r\nwill still be white.  The whiteness of snow with the sun shining upon\r\nit, is barely tolerable to the eye.  The same snow under an overcast\r\nfirmament is still white.  Such a firmament enfeebles the light by\r\nreflecting it upwards; and when we stand above a cloud-field--on an\r\nAlpine summit, for instance, or on the top of Snowdon--and see, in the\r\nproper direction, the sun shining on the clouds below us, they appear\r\ndazzlingly white.  Ordinary clouds, in fact, divide the solar light\r\nimpinging on them into two parts--a reflected part and a transmitted\r\npart, in each of which the proportions of wave-motion which produce\r\nthe impression of whiteness are sensibly preserved.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that the condition of whiteness would fail if\r\nall the waves were diminished _equally_, or by the same absolute\r\nquantity.  They must be reduced _proportionately_, instead of equally.\r\nIf by the act of reflection the waves of red light are split into\r\nexact halves, then, to preserve the light white, the waves of yellow,\r\norange, green, and blue, must also be split into exact halves.  In\r\nshort, the reduction must take place, not by absolutely equal\r\nquantities, but by equal fractional parts.  In white light the\r\npreponderance, as regards energy, of the larger over the smaller waves\r\nmust always be immense.  Were the case otherwise, the visual\r\ncorrelative, blue, of the smaller waves would have the upper hand in\r\nour sensations.\r\n\r\nNot only are the waves of aether reflected by clouds, by solids, and\r\nby liquids, but when they pass from light air to dense, or from dense\r\nair to light, a portion of the wave-motion is always reflected.  Now\r\nour atmosphere changes continually in density from top to bottom.  It\r\nwill help our conceptions if we regard it as made up of a series of\r\nthin concentric layers, or shells of air, each shell being of the same\r\ndensity throughout, a small and sudden change of density occurring in\r\npassing from shell to shell.  Light would be reflected at the limiting\r\nsurfaces of all these shells, and their action would be practically\r\nthe same as that of the real atmosphere.  And now I would ask your\r\nimagination to picture this act of reflection.  What must become of\r\nthe reflected light?  The atmospheric layers turn their convex\r\nsurfaces towards the sun; they are so many convex mirrors of feeble\r\npower; and you will immediately perceive that the light regularly\r\nreflected from these surfaces cannot reach the earth at all, but is\r\ndispersed in space.  Light thus reflected cannot, therefore, be the\r\nlight of the sky.\r\n\r\nBut, though the sun's light is not reflected in this fashion from the\r\naerial layers to the earth, there is indubitable evidence to show that\r\nthe light of our firmament is scattered light.  Proofs of the most\r\ncogent description could be here adduced; but we need only consider\r\nthat we receive light at the same time from all parts of the\r\nhemisphere of heaven.  The light of the firmament comes to us across\r\nthe direction of the solar rays, and even against the direction of the\r\nsolar rays; and this lateral and opposing rush of wave-motion can only\r\nbe due to the rebound of the waves from the air itself, or from\r\nsomething suspended in the air.  It is also evident that, unlike the\r\naction of clouds, the solar light is not reflected by the sky in the\r\nproportions which produce white.  The sky is blue, which indicates an\r\nexcess of the shorter waves.  In accounting for the colour of the sky,\r\nthe first question suggested by analogy would undoubtedly be, Is not\r\nthe air blue?  The blueness of the air has, in fact, been given as a\r\nsolution of the blueness of the sky.  But how, if the air be blue, can\r\nthe light of sunrise and sunset, which travels through vast distances\r\nof air, be yellow, orange, or even red?  The passage of white solar\r\nlight through a blue medium could by no possibility redden the light.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of a blue air is therefore untenable.  In fact the\r\nagent, whatever it is, which sends us the light of the sky, exercises\r\nin so doing a dichroitic action.  The light reflected is blue, the\r\nlight transmitted is orange or red.  A marked distinction is thus\r\nexhibited between the matter of the sky, and that of an ordinary\r\ncloud, which exercises no such dichroitic action.\r\n\r\nBy the scientific use of the imagination we may hope to penetrate this\r\nmystery.  The cloud takes no note of size on the part of the waves of\r\naether, but reflects them all alike.  It exercises no selective\r\naction.  Now the cause of this may be that the cloud particles are so\r\nlarge, in comparison with the waves of aether, as to reflect them all\r\nindifferently.  A broad cliff reflects an Atlantic roller as easily as\r\na ripple produced by a seabird's wing; and in the presence of large\r\nreflecting surfaces, the existing differences of magnitude among the\r\nwaves of aether may disappear.  But supposing the reflecting\r\nparticles, instead of being very large, to be very small in comparison\r\nwith the size of the waves.  In this case, instead of the whole wave\r\nbeing fronted and thrown back, a small portion only is shivered off.\r\nThe great mass of the wave passes over such a particle without\r\nreflection.  Scatter, then, a handful of such minute foreign particles\r\nin our atmosphere, and set imagination to watch their action upon the\r\nsolar waves.  Waves of all sizes impinge upon the particles, and you\r\nsee at every collision a portion of the impinging wave struck off; all\r\nthe waves of the spectrum, from the extreme red to the extreme violet,\r\nbeing thus acted upon.\r\n\r\nRemembering that the red waves stand to the blue much in the relation\r\nof billows to ripples, we have to consider whether those extremely\r\nsmall particles are competent to scatter all the waves in the same\r\nproportion.  If they be not--and a little reflection will make it\r\nclear that they are not--the production of colour must be an incident\r\nof the scattering.  Largeness is a thing of relation; and the smaller\r\nthe wave, the greater is the relative size of any particle on which\r\nthe wave impinges, and the greater also the ratio of the portion\r\nscattered to the total wave A pebble, placed in the way of the\r\nring-ripples produced by heavy raindrops on a tranquil pond, will\r\nscatter a large fraction of each ripple, while the fractional part of\r\na larger wave thrown back by the same pebble might be infinitesimal.\r\nNow we have already made it clear to our minds that to preserve the\r\nsolar light white, its constituent proportions must not be altered;\r\nbut in the act of division performed by these very small particles the\r\nproportions are altered; an undue fraction of the smaller waves is\r\nscattered by the particles, and, as a consequence, in the scattered\r\nlight, blue will be the predominant colour.  The other colours of the\r\nspectrum must, to some extent, be associated with the blue.  They are\r\nnot absent, but deficient.  We ought, in fact, to have them all, but\r\nin diminishing proportions, from the violet to the red.\r\n\r\nWe have here presented a case to the imagination, pad, assuming the\r\nundulatory theory to be a reality, we have, I think, fairly reasoned\r\nour way to the conclusion, that were particles, small in comparison to\r\nthe sizes of the aether waves, sown in our atmosphere, the light\r\nscattered by those particles would be exactly such as we observe in\r\nour azure skies.  When this light is analysed, all the colours of the\r\nspectrum are found, and they are found in the proportions indicated by\r\nour conclusion.  Blue is not the sole, but it is the predominant\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to the light which passes unscattered\r\namong the particles.  How must it be finally affected?  By its\r\nsuccessive collisions with the particles the white light is more and\r\nmore robbed of its shorter waves; it therefore loses more and more of\r\nits due proportion of blue.  The result may be anticipated.  The\r\ntransmitted light, where short distances are involved, will appear\r\nyellowish.  But as the sun sinks towards the horizon the atmospheric\r\ndistances increase, and consequently the number of the scattering\r\nparticles.  They abstract in succession the violet, the indigo, the\r\nblue, and even disturb the proportions of green.  The transmitted\r\nlight under such circumstances must pass from yellow through orange to\r\nred.  This also is exactly what we find in nature.  Thus, while the\r\nreflected light gives us at noon the deep azure of the Alpine skies,\r\nthe transmitted light gives us at sunset the warm crimson of the\r\nAlpine snows.  The phenomena certainly occur as if our atmosphere were\r\na medium rendered slightly turbid by the mechanical suspension of\r\nexceedingly small foreign particles.\r\n\r\nHere, as before, we encounter our sceptical 'as if.' It is one of the\r\nparasites of science, ever at hand, and ready to plant itself and\r\nsprout, if it can, on the weak points of our philosophy.  But a strong\r\nconstitution defies the parasite, and in our case, as we question the\r\nphenomena, probability grows like growing health, until in the end the\r\nmalady of doubt is completely extirpated.  The first question that\r\nnaturally arises is this: Can small particles be really proved to act\r\nin the manner indicated?  No doubt of it.  Each one of you can submit\r\nthe question to an experimental test. Water will not dissolve resin,\r\nbut spirit will dissolve it; and when spirit holding resin in solution\r\nis dropped into water, the resin immediately separates in solid\r\nparticles, which render the water milky.  The coarseness of this\r\nprecipitate depends on the quantity of the dissolved resin.  You can\r\ncause it to separate either in thick clots or in exceedingly fine\r\nparticles.  Professor Bruecke has given us the proportions which\r\nproduce particles particularly suited to our present purpose.  One\r\ngramme of clean mastic is dissolved in eighty-seven grammes of\r\nabsolute alcohol, and the transparent solution is allowed to drop into\r\na beaker containing clear water, kept briskly stirred.  An exceedingly\r\nfine precipitate is thus formed, which declares its presence by its\r\naction upon light.  Placing a dark surface behind the beaker, and\r\npermitting the light to fall into it from the top or front, the medium\r\nis seen to be distinctly blue.  It is not perhaps so perfect a blue as\r\nmay be seen on exceptional days among the Alps, but it is a very fair\r\nsky-blue.  A trace of soap in water gives a tint of blue.  London, and\r\nI fear Liverpool, milk makes an approximation to the same colour,\r\nthrough the operation of the same cause; and Helmholtz has\r\nirreverently disclosed the fact that the deepest blue eye is simply a\r\nturbid medium.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe action of turbid media upon light was illustrated by Goethe, who,\r\nthough unacquainted with the undulatory theory, was led by his\r\nexperiments to regard the firmament as an illuminated turbid medium,\r\nwith the darkness of space behind it.  He describes glasses showing a\r\nbright yellow by transmitted, and a beautiful blue by reflected,\r\nlight.  Professor Stokes, who was probably the first to discern the\r\nreal nature of the action of small particles on the waves of aether,\r\n[Footnote: This is inferred from conversation.  I am not aware that\r\nProfessor Stokes has published anything upon the subject.] describes\r\na glass of a similar kind. [Footnote: This glass, by reflected light,\r\nhad a colour 'strongly resembling that of a decoction of\r\nhorse-chestnut bark.' Curiously enough, Goethe refers to this very\r\ndecoction: 'Man nehme einen Streifen frischer Rinds von der\r\nRosskastanie, man stecke denselben in ein Glas Wasser, und in der\r\nkuerzesten Zeit werden wir das vollkommenste Himmelblau entstehen\r\nsehen.'--Goethe's Werke, B. xxix. p. 24.]\r\n\r\nCapital specimens of such glass are to be found at Salviati's, in St.\r\nJames's Street.  What artists call 'chill' is no doubt an effect of\r\nthis description.  Through the action of minute particles, the browns\r\nof a picture often present the appearance of the bloom of a plum.  By\r\nrubbing the varnish with a silk handkerchief optical continuity is\r\nestablished and the chill disappears.  Some years ago I witnessed Mr.\r\nHirst experimenting at Zermatt on the turbid water of the Visp.  When\r\nkept still for a day or so, the grosser matter sank, but the finer\r\nparticles remained suspended, and gave a distinctly blue tinge to the\r\nwater.  The blueness of certain Alpine lakes has been shown to be in\r\npart due to this cause.  Professor Roscoe has noticed several striking\r\ncases of a similar kind.  In a very remarkable paper the late\r\nPrincipal Forbes showed that steam issuing from the safety-valve of a\r\nlocomotive, when favourably observed, exhibits at a certain stage of\r\nits condensation the colours of the sky.  It is blue by reflected\r\nlight, and orange or red by transmitted light.  The same effect, as\r\npointed out by Goethe, is to some extent exhibited by peat-smoke. More\r\nthan ten years ago, I amused myself by observing, on a calm day at\r\nKillarney, the straight smoke-columns rising from the cabin-chimneys.\r\nIt was easy to project the lower portion of a column against a dark\r\npine, and its upper portion against a bright cloud. The smoke in the\r\nformer case was blue, being seen mainly by reflected light; in the\r\nlatter case it was reddish, being seen mainly by transmitted light.\r\nSuch smoke was not in exactly the condition to give us the glow of the\r\nAlps, but it was a step in this direction. Bruecke's fine precipitate\r\nabove referred to looks yellowish by transmitted light; but, by duly\r\nstrengthening the precipitate, you may render the white light of noon\r\nas ruby-coloured as the sun, when seen through Liverpool smoke, or\r\nupon Alpine horizons.  I do not, however, point to the gross smoke\r\narising from coal as an illustration of the action of small particles,\r\nbecause such smoke soon absorbs and destroys the waves of blue,\r\ninstead of sending them to the eyes of the observer.\r\n\r\nThese multifarious facts, and numberless others which cannot now be\r\nreferred to, are explained by reference to the single principle, that,\r\nwhere the scattering particles are small in comparison to the\r\naethereal waves, we have in the reflected light a greater proportion\r\nof the smaller waves, and in the transmitted light a greater\r\nproportion of the larger waves, than existed in the original white\r\nlight.  The consequence, as regards sensation, is that in the one ease\r\nblue is predominant, and in the other orange or red.  Our best\r\nmicroscopes can readily reveal objects not more than 1/50000th of an\r\ninch in diameter.  This is less than the length of a wave of red\r\nlight.  Indeed a first-rate microscope would enable us to discern\r\nobjects not exceeding in diameter the length of the smallest waves of\r\nthe visible spectrum. [Footnote: Dallinger and Drysdale have recently\r\nmeasured cilia 1/200000th of an inch in diameter.  1878.]  By the\r\nmicroscope, therefore, we can test our particles.  If they be as large\r\nas the light-waves they will infallibly be seen; and if they be not so\r\nseen, it is because they are smaller.  Some months ago I placed in the\r\nhands of our President a liquid containing Bruecke's precipitate.  The\r\nliquid was milky blue, and Mr. Huxley applied to it his highest\r\nmicroscopic power.  He satisfied me that had particles of even\r\n1/100000th of an inch in diameter existed in the liquid, they could\r\nnot have escaped detection.  But no particles were seen.  Under the\r\nmicroscope the turbid liquid was not to be distinguished from\r\ndistilled water. [Footnote: Like Dr. Burdon Sanderson's 'pyrogen,'\r\nthe particles of mastic passed, without sensible hindrance, through\r\nfiltering-paper.  By such filtering no freedom from suspended\r\nparticles is secured.  The application of a condensed beam to the\r\nfiltrate renders this at once evident.]\r\n\r\nBut we have it in our power to imitate, far more closely than we have\r\nhitherto done, the natural conditions of this problem.  We can\r\ngenerate, in air, artificial skies, and prove their perfect identity\r\nwith the natural one, as regards the exhibition of a number of wholly\r\nunexpected phenomena.  By a continuous process of growth, moreover, we\r\nare able to connect sky-matter, if I may use the term, with molecular\r\nmatter on the one side, and with molar matter, or matter in sensible\r\nmasses, on the other.  In illustration of this, I will take an\r\nexperiment suggested by some of my own researches, and described by M.\r\nMorren of Marseilles at the Exeter meeting of the British Association.\r\nSulphur and oxygen combine to form sulphurous acid gas, two atoms of\r\noxygen and one of sulphur constituting the molecule of sulphurous\r\nacid.  It has been recently shown that waves of aether issuing from a\r\nstrong source, such as the sun or the electric light, are competent to\r\nshake asunder the atoms of gaseous molecules. [Footnote: See 'New\r\nChemical Reactions produced by Light,' vol. i.]  A chemist would\r\ncall this, 'decomposition' by light; but it behoves us, who are\r\nexamining the power and function of the imagination, to keep\r\nconstantly before us the physical images which underlie our terms.\r\nTherefore I say, sharply and definitely, that the components of the\r\nmolecules of sulphurous acid are shaken asunder by the aether-waves.\r\nEnclosing sulphurous acid in a suitable vessel, placing it in a dark\r\nroom, and sending through it a powerful beam of light, we at first see\r\nnothing: the vessel containing the gas seems as empty as a vacuum.\r\nSoon, however, along the track of the beam a beautiful sky-blue colour\r\nis observed, which is due to light scattered by the liberated\r\nparticles of sulphur.  For a time the blue grows more intense; it then\r\nbecomes whitish; and ends in a more or less perfect white.  When the\r\naction is continued long enough, the tube is filled with a dense cloud\r\nof sulphur particles, which by the application of proper means may be\r\nrendered individually visible. [Footnote: M. Morren was mistaken in\r\nsupposing that a modicum of sulphurous acid, in the drying tubes, had\r\nany share in the production of the 'actinic clouds' described by me. A\r\nbeautiful case of molecular instability in the presence of light is\r\nfurnished by peroxide of chlorine as proved by Professor Dewar. 1878.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, our aether-waves untie the bond of chemical affinity, and\r\nliberate a body--sulphur--which at ordinary temperatures is a solid,\r\nand which therefore soon becomes an object of the senses.  We have\r\nfirst of all the free atoms of sulphur, which are incompetent to stir\r\nthe retina sensibly with scattered light.  But these atoms gradually\r\ncoalesce and form _particles_, which grow larger by continual accretion,\r\nuntil after a minute or two they appear as sky-matter.  In this\r\ncondition they are individually invisible; but collectively they send\r\nan amount of wave-motion to the retina, sufficient to produce the\r\nfirmamental blue.  The particles continue, or may be caused to\r\ncontinue, in this condition for a considerable time, during which no\r\nmicroscope can cope with them.  But they grow slowly larger, and pass\r\nby insensible gradations into the state of _cloud_, when they can no\r\nlonger elude the armed eye.  Thus, without solution of continuity, we\r\nstart with matter in the atom, and end with matter in the mass;\r\nsky-matter being the middle term of the series of transformations.\r\nInstead of sulphurous acid, we might choose a dozen other substances,\r\nand produce the same effect with all of them.  In the case of\r\nsome--probably in the case of all--it is possible to preserve matter\r\nin the firmamental condition for fifteen or twenty minutes under the\r\ncontinual operation of the light.  During these fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes the particles constantly grow larger, without ever exceeding\r\nthe size requisite to the production of the celestial blue.\r\n\r\nNow when two vessels are placed before us, each containing sky-matter,\r\nit is possible to state with great distinctness which vessel contains\r\nthe largest particles.  The eye is very sensitive to differences of\r\nlight, when, as in our experiments, it is placed in comparative\r\ndarkness, and the wave-motion thrown against the retina is small.  The\r\nlarger particles declare themselves by the greater whiteness of their\r\nscattered light.  Call now to mind the observation, or effort at\r\nobservation, made by our President, when he failed to distinguish the\r\nparticles of mastic in Bruecke's medium, and when you have done this,\r\nplease follow me.\r\n\r\nA beam of light is permitted to act upon a certain vapour.  In two\r\nminutes the azure appears, but at the end of fifteen minutes it has\r\nnot ceased to be azure.  After fifteen minutes its colour, and some\r\nother phenomena, pronounce it to be a blue of distinctly smaller\r\nparticles than those sought for in vain by Mr. Huxley.  These\r\nparticles, as already stated, must have been less than 1/100000th of\r\nan inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nAnd now I want you to consider the following question: Here are\r\nparticles which have been growing continually for fifteen minutes, and\r\nat the end of that time are demonstrably smaller than those which\r\ndefied the microscope of Mr. Huxley--_What must have been the size of\r\nthese particles at the beginning of their growth?_  What notion can you\r\nform of the magnitude of such particles?  The distances of stellar\r\nspace give us simply a bewildering sense of vastness, without leaving\r\nany distinct impression on the mind; and the magnitudes with which we\r\nhave here to do, bewilder us equally in the opposite direction.  We\r\nare dealing with infinitesimals, compared with which the test objects\r\nof the microscope are literally immense.\r\n\r\nFrom their perviousness to stellar light, and other considerations,\r\nSir John Herschel drew some startling conclusions regarding the\r\ndensity and weight of comets.  You know that these extraordinary and\r\nmysterious bodies sometimes throw out tails 100,000,000 miles in\r\nlength, and 50,000 miles in diameter.  The diameter of our earth is\r\n8,000 miles.  Both it and the sky, and a good portion of space beyond\r\nthe sky, would certainly be included in a sphere 10,000 miles across.\r\nLet us fill a hollow sphere of this diameter with cometary matter, and\r\nmake it our unit of measure.  To produce a comet's tail of the size\r\njust mentioned, about 300,000 such measures would have to be emptied\r\ninto space.  Now suppose the whole of this stuff to be swept together,\r\nand suitably compressed, what do you suppose its volume would be?  Sir\r\nJohn Herschel would probably tell you that the whole mass might be\r\ncarted away, at a single effort, by one of your dray-horses.  In fact,\r\nI do not know that he would require more than a small fraction of a\r\nhorse-power to remove the cometary dust. After this, you will hardly\r\nregard as monstrous a notion I have sometimes entertained, concerning\r\nthe quantity, of matter in our sky.  Suppose a shell to surround the\r\nearth at a distance which would place it beyond the grosser matter\r\nthat hangs in the lower regions of the air--say at the height of the\r\nMatterhorn or Mont Blanc.  Outside this shell we should have the deep\r\nblue firmament.  Let the atmospheric space beyond the shell be swept\r\nclean, and the sky-matter properly gathered up.  What would be its\r\nprobable amount?  I have sometimes thought that a lady's portmanteau\r\nwould contain it all.  I have thought that even a gentleman's\r\nportmanteau--possibly his snuff-box--might take it in.  And, whether\r\nthe actual sky be capable of this amount of condensation or not, I\r\nentertain no doubt that a sky quite as vast as ours, and as good in\r\nappearance, could be formed from a quantity of matter which might be\r\nheld in the hollow of the hand.\r\n\r\nSmall in mass, the vastness in point of number of the particles of our\r\nsky may be inferred from the continuity of its light.  It is not in\r\nbroken patches, nor at scattered points, that the heavenly azure is\r\nrevealed.  To the observer on the summit of Mont Blanc, the blue is as\r\nuniform and coherent as if it formed the surface of the most\r\nclose-grained solid.  A marble dome would not exhibit a stricter\r\ncontinuity.  And Mr. Glaisher will inform you, that if our\r\nhypothetical shell were lifted to twice the height of Mont Blanc above\r\nthe earth's surface, we should still have the azure overhead.\r\nEverywhere through the atmosphere those sky-particles are strewn. They\r\nfill the Alpine valleys, spreading like a delicate gauze in front of\r\nthe slopes of pine.  They sometimes so swathe the peaks with light as\r\nto abolish their definition.  This year I have seen the Weisshorn thus\r\ndissolved in opalescent air.  By proper instruments the glare thrown\r\nfrom the sky-particles against the retina may be quenched, and then\r\nthe mountain which it obliterated starts into sudden definition.\r\n[Footnote: See the 'Sky of the Alps,' Art. iv. sec. 3, vol. i.]\r\nIts extinction in front of a dark mountain resembles exactly the\r\nwithdrawal of a veil.  It is then the light taking possession of the\r\neye, not the particles acting as opaque bodies, that interferes with\r\nthe definition.  By day this light quenches the stars; even by\r\nmoonlight it is able to exclude from vision all stars between the\r\nfifth and the eleventh magnitude.  It may be likened to a noise, and\r\nthe feebler stellar radiance to a whisper drowned by the noise.\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of the particles which shed this light?  The\r\ncelebrated De la Rive ascribes the haze of the Alps in fine weather to\r\nfloating organic germs.  Now the possible existence of germs in such\r\nprofusion has been held up as an absurdity.  It has been affirmed that\r\nthey would darken the air, and on the assumed impossibility of their\r\nexistence in the requisite numbers, without invasion of the solar\r\nlight, an apparently powerful argument has been based by believers in\r\nspontaneous generation.  Similar arguments have been used by the\r\nopponents of the germ theory of epidemic disease, who have\r\ntriumphantly challenged an appeal to the microscope and the chemist's\r\nbalance to decide the question.  Such arguments, however, are founded\r\non a defective acquaintance with the powers and properties of matter.\r\nWithout committing myself in the least to De la Rive's notion, to the\r\ndoctrine of spontaneous generation, or to the germ theory of disease,\r\nI would simply draw attention to the demonstrable fact, that, in the\r\natmosphere, we have particles which defy both the microscope and the\r\nbalance, which do not darken the air, and which exist, nevertheless,\r\nin multitudes sufficient to reduce to insignificance the Israelitish\r\nhyperbole regarding the sands upon the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe varying judgments of men on these and other questions may perhaps\r\nbe, to some extent, accounted for by that doctrine of Relativity which\r\nplays so important a part in philosophy.  This doctrine affirms that\r\nthe impressions made upon us by any circumstance, or combination of\r\ncircumstances, depend upon our previous state.  Two travellers upon\r\nthe same height, the one having ascended to it from the plain, the\r\nother having descended to it from a higher elevation, will be\r\ndifferently affected by the scene around them.  To the one nature is\r\nexpanding, to the other it is contracting, and impressions which have\r\ntwo such different antecedent states are sure to differ.  In our\r\nscientific judgments the law of relativity may also play an important\r\npart.  To two men, one educated in the school of the senses, having\r\nmainly occupied himself with observation; the other educated in the\r\nschool of imagination as well, and exercised in the conceptions of\r\natoms and molecules to which we have so frequently referred, a bit of\r\nmatter, say 1/50000th of an inch in diameter, will present itself\r\ndifferently.  The one descends to it from his molar heights, the other\r\nclimbs to it from his molecular lowlands.  To the one it appears\r\nsmall, to the other large.  So, also, as regards the appreciation of\r\nthe most minute forms of life revealed by the microscope.  To one of\r\nthe men these naturally appear conterminous with the ultimate\r\nparticles of matter; there is but a step from the atom to the\r\norganism.  The other discerns numberless organic gradations between\r\nboth.  Compared with his atoms, the smallest vibrios and bacteria of\r\nthe microscopic field are as behemoth and leviathan.  The law of\r\nrelativity may to some extent explain the different attitudes of two\r\nsuch persons with regard to the question of spontaneous generation. An\r\namount of evidence which satisfies the one entirely fails to satisfy\r\nthe other; and while to the one the last bold defence and startling\r\nexpansion of the doctrine by Dr. Bastian will appear perfectly\r\nconclusive, to the other it will present itself as merely imposing a\r\nlabour of demolition on subsequent investigators. [Footnote: When\r\nthese words were uttered I did not imagine that the chief labour of\r\ndemolition would fall upon myself.  1878.]\r\n\r\nLet me say here that many of our physiological observers appear to\r\nform a very inadequate estimate of the distance which separates the\r\nmicroscopic from the molecular limit, and that, as a consequence, they\r\nsometimes employ a phraseology calculated to mislead.  When, for\r\nexample, the contents of a cell are described as perfectly homogeneous\r\nor as absolutely structureless, because the microscope fails to\r\ndiscover any structure; or when two structures are pronounced to be\r\nwithout difference, because the microscope can discover none, then, I\r\nthink the microscope begins to play a mischievous part.  A little\r\nconsideration will make it plain that the microscope can have no voice\r\nin the question of germ structure.  Distilled water is more perfectly\r\nhomogeneous than any possible organic germ.  What is it that causes\r\nthe liquid to cease contracting at 39 degrees Fahr, and to expand\r\nuntil it freezes?  We have here a structural process of which the\r\nmicroscope can take no note, nor is it likely to do so by any\r\nconceivable extension of its powers.  Place distilled water in the\r\nfield of an electro-magnet, and bring a microscope to bear upon it.\r\nWill any change be observed when the magnet is excited?  Absolutely\r\nnone; and still profound and complex changes have occurred.  First of\r\nall, the particles of water have been rendered diamagnetically polar;\r\nand secondly, in virtue of the structure impressed upon it by the\r\nmagnetic whirl of its molecules, the liquid twists a ray of light in a\r\nfashion perfectly determinate both as to quantity and direction.\r\n\r\nHave the diamond, the amethyst, and the countless other crystals\r\nformed in the laboratories of nature and of man no structure?\r\nAssuredly they have; but what can the microscope make of it?  Nothing.\r\nIt cannot be too distinctly borne in mind that between the microscopic\r\nlimit, and the true molecular limit, there is room for infinite\r\npermutations and combinations.  It is in this region that the poles of\r\nthe atoms are arranged, that tendency is given to their powers; so\r\nthat when these poles and powers have free action, proper stimulus,\r\nand a suitable environment, they determine, first the germ, and\r\nafterwards the complete organism.  This first marshalling of the\r\natoms, on which all subsequent action depends, baffles a keener power\r\nthan that of the microscope.  When duly pondered, the complexity of\r\nthe problem raises the doubt, not of the power of our instrument, for\r\nthat is nil, but whether we ourselves possess the intellectual\r\nelements which will ever enable us to grapple with the ultimate\r\nstructural energies of nature. [Footnote: 'In using the expression\r\n\"one sort of living substance\" I must guard against being supposed to\r\nmean that any kind of living protoplasm is homogeneous.  Hyaline\r\nthough it may appear, we are not at present able to assign any limit\r\nto its complexity of structure.'--Burdon Sanderson, in the 'British\r\nMedical Journal,' January 16, 1875.  We have here scientific insight,\r\nand its correlative caution.  In fact Dr. Sanderson' s important\r\nresearches are a continued illustration of the position laid down\r\nabove.]\r\n\r\nIn more senses than one Mr. Darwin has drawn heavily upon the\r\nscientific tolerance of his age.  He has drawn heavily upon time in\r\nhis development of species, and he has drawn adventurously upon matter\r\nin his theory of pangenesis.  According to this theory, a germ,\r\nalready microscopic, is a world of minor germs.  Not only is the\r\norganism as a whole wrapped up in the germ, but every organ of the\r\norganism has there its special seed.  This, I say, is an adventurous\r\ndraft on the power of matter to divide itself and distribute its\r\nforces.  But, unless we are perfectly sure that he is overstepping the\r\nbounds of reason, that he is unwittingly sinning against observed fact\r\nor demonstrated law--for a mind like that of Darwin can never sin\r\nwittingly against either fact or law--we ought, I think, to be\r\ncautious in limiting his intellectual horizon.  If there be the least\r\ndoubt in the matter, it ought to be given in favour of the freedom of\r\nsuch a mind.  To it a vast possibility is in itself a dynamic power,\r\nthough the possibility may never be drawn upon.  It gives me pleasure\r\nto think that the facts and reasonings of this discourse tend rather\r\ntowards the justification of Mr. Darwin, than towards his\r\ncondemnation; for they seem to show the perfect competence of matter\r\nand force, as regards divisibility and distribution, to bear the\r\nheaviest strain that he has hitherto imposed upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mr. Darwin, observation, imagination, and reason\r\ncombined have run back with wonderful sagacity and success over a\r\ncertain length of the line of biological succession.  Guided by\r\nanalogy, in his 'Origin of Species' he placed at the root of life a\r\nprimordial germ, from which he conceived the amazing variety of the\r\norganisms now upon earth's surface might be deduced.  If this\r\nhypothesis were even true, it would not be final.  The human mind\r\nwould infallibly look behind the germ, and however hopeless the\r\nattempt, would enquire into the history of its genesis.  In this dim\r\ntwilight of conjecture the searcher welcomes every gleam, and seeks to\r\naugment his light by indirect incidences.  He studies the methods of\r\nnature in the ages and the worlds within his reach, in order to shape\r\nthe course of speculation in antecedent ages and worlds.  And though\r\nthe certainty possessed by experimental enquiry is here shut out, we\r\nare not left entirely without guidance.  From the examination of the\r\nsolar system, Kant and Laplace came to the conclusion that its various\r\nbodies once formed parts of the same undislocated mass; that matter in\r\na nebulous form preceded matter in its present form; that as the ages\r\nrolled away, heat was wasted, condensation followed, planets were\r\ndetached; and that finally the chief portion of the hot cloud reached,\r\nby self-compression, the magnitude and density of our sun.  The earth\r\nitself offers evidence of a fiery origin; and in our day the\r\nhypothesis of Kant and Laplace receives the independent countenance of\r\nspectrum analysis, which proves the same substances to be common to\r\nthe earth and sun.\r\n\r\nAccepting some such view of the construction of our system as\r\nprobable, a desire immediately arises to connect the present life of\r\nour planet with the past. We wish to know something of our remotest\r\nancestry.  On its first detachment from the central mass, life, as we\r\nunderstand it, could not have been present on the earth.  How, then,\r\ndid it come there?  The thing to be encouraged here is a reverent\r\nfreedom--a freedom preceded by the hard discipline which checks\r\nlicentiousness in speculation--while the thing to be repressed, both\r\nin science and out of it, is dogmatism.  And here I am in the hands of\r\nthe meeting--willing to end, but ready to go on.  I have no right to\r\nintrude upon you, unasked, the unformed notions which are floating\r\nlike clouds, or gathering to more solid consistency, in the modern\r\nspeculative scientific mind.  But if you wish me to speak plainly,\r\nhonestly, and undisputatiously, I am willing to do so.  On the present\r\noccasion--\r\n\r\n    You are ordained to call, and I to come.\r\n\r\nWell, your answer is given, and I obey your call.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years ago, in an ancient London College, I listened to a\r\ndiscussion at the end of a lecture by a very remarkable man.  Three or\r\nfour hundred clergymen were present at the lecture.  The orator began\r\nwith the civilisation of Egypt in the time of 'Joseph; pointing out\r\nthe very perfect organisation of the kingdom, and the possession of\r\nchariots, in one of which Joseph rode, as proving a long antecedent\r\nperiod of civilisation.  He then passed on to the mud of the Nile, its\r\nrate of augmentation, its present thickness, and the remains of human\r\nhandiwork found therein: thence to the rocks which bound the Nile\r\nvalley, and which teem with organic remains.  Thus in his own clear\r\nway he caused the idea of the world's age to expand itself\r\nindefinitely before the minds of his audience, and he contrasted this\r\nwith the age usually assigned to the world.  During his discourse he\r\nseemed to be swimming against a stream, he manifestly thought that he\r\nwas opposing a general conviction.  He expected resistance in the\r\nsubsequent discussion; so did I.  But it was all a mistake; there was\r\nno adverse current, no opposing conviction, no resistance; merely here\r\nand there a half-humorous, but unsuccessful attempt to entangle him in\r\nhis talk.  The meeting agreed with all that had been said regarding\r\nthe antiquity of the earth and of its life.  They had, indeed, known\r\nit all long ago, and they rallied the lecturer for coming amongst them\r\nwith so stale a story.  It was quite plain that this large body of\r\nclergymen, who were, I should say, to be ranked amongst the finest\r\nsamples of their class, had entirely given up the ancient landmarks,\r\nand transported the conception of life's origin to an indefinitely\r\ndistant past.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the gist of our present enquiry, which is this: Does\r\nlife belong to what we call matter, or is it an independent principle\r\ninserted into matter at some suitable epoch--say when the physical\r\nconditions became such as to permit of the development of life?  Let\r\nus put the question with the reverence due to a faith and culture in\r\nwhich we all were cradled, and which are the undeniable historic\r\nantecedents of our present enlightenment.  I say, let us put the\r\nquestion reverently, but let us also put it clearly and definitely.\r\nThere are the strongest grounds for believing that during a certain\r\nperiod of its history the earth was not, nor was it fit to be, the\r\ntheatre of life.  Whether this was ever a nebulous period, or merely a\r\nmolten period, does not signify much; and if we revert to the nebulous\r\ncondition, it is because the probabilities are really on its side. Our\r\nquestion is this: Did creative energy pause until the nebulous matter\r\nhad condensed, until the earth had been detached, until the solar fire\r\nhad so far withdrawn from the earth's vicinity as to permit a crust to\r\ngather round the planet?  Did it wait until the air was isolated;\r\nuntil the seas were formed; until evaporation, condensation, and the\r\ndescent of rain had begun; until the eroding forces of the atmosphere\r\nhad weathered and decomposed the molten rocks so as to form soils;\r\nuntil the sun's rays had become so tempered by distance, and by waste,\r\nas to be chemically fit for the decompositions necessary to vegetable\r\nlife?  Having waited through these aeons until the proper conditions\r\nhad set in, did it send the flat forth, 'Let there be Life!'?  These\r\nquestions define a hypothesis not without its difficulties, but the\r\ndignity of which in relation to the world's knowledge was demonstrated\r\nby the nobleness of the men whom it sustained.\r\n\r\nModern scientific thought is called upon to decide between this\r\nhypothesis and another; and public thought generally will afterwards\r\nbe called upon to do the same.  But, however the convictions of\r\nindividuals here and there may be influenced, the process must be slow\r\nand secular which commends the hypothesis of Natural Evolution to the\r\npublic mind.  For what are the core and essence of this hypothesis?\r\nStrip it naked, and you stand face to face with the notion that not\r\nalone the more ignoble forms of animalcular or animal life, not alone\r\nthe nobler forms of the horse and lion, not alone the exquisite and\r\nwonderful mechanism of the human body, but that the human mind\r\nitself--emotion, intellect, will, and all their phenomena--were once\r\nlatent in a fiery cloud.  Surely the mere statement of such a notion\r\nis more than a refutation.  But the hypothesis would probably go even\r\nfarther than this.  Many who hold it would probably assent to the\r\nposition that, at the present moment, all our philosophy, all our\r\npoetry, all our science, and all our art--Plato, Shakspeare, Newton,\r\nand Raphael--are potential in the fires of the sun.  We long to learn\r\nsomething of our origin.  If the Evolution hypothesis be correct, even\r\nthis unsatisfied yearning must have come to us across the ages which\r\nseparate the primeval mist from the consciousness of to-day.  I do not\r\nthink that any holder of the Evolution hypothesis would say that I\r\noverstate or overstrain it in any way.  I merely strip it of all\r\nvagueness, and bring before you, unclothed and unvarnished, the\r\nnotions by which it must stand or fall.\r\n\r\nSurely these notions represent an absurdity too monstrous to be\r\nentertained by any sane mind.  But why are such notions absurd, and\r\nwhy should sanity reject them?  The law of Relativity, of which we\r\nhave previously spoken, may find its application here.  These\r\nEvolution notions are absurd, monstrous, and fit only for the\r\nintellectual gibbet, in relation to the ideas concerning matter which\r\nwere drilled into us when young.  Spirit and matter have ever been\r\npresented to us in the rudest contrast, the one as all-noble, the\r\nother as all-vile.  But is this correct?  Upon the answer to this\r\nquestion all depends.  Supposing that, instead of having the foregoing\r\nantithesis of spirit and matter presented to our youthful minds, we\r\nhad been taught to regard them as equally worthy, and equally\r\nwonderful; to consider them, in fact, as two opposite faces of the\r\nself-same mystery.  Supposing that in youth we had been impregnated\r\nwith the notion of the poet Goethe, instead of the notion of the poet\r\nYoung, and taught to look upon matter, not as 'brute matter,' but as\r\nthe 'living garment of God;' do you not think that under these\r\naltered circumstances the law of Relativity might have had an outcome\r\ndifferent from its present one?  Is it not probable that our\r\nrepugnance to the idea of primeval union between spirit and matter\r\nmight be considerably abated?  Without this total revolution of the\r\nnotions now prevalent, the Evolution hypothesis must stand condemned;\r\nbut in many profoundly thoughtful minds such a revolution has already\r\ntaken place.  They degrade neither member of the mysterious duality\r\nreferred to; but they exalt one of them from its abasement, and repeal\r\nthe divorce hitherto existing between them.  In substance, if not in\r\nwords, their position as regards the relation of spirit and matter is:\r\n'What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.'\r\n\r\nYou have been thus led to the outer rim of speculative science, for\r\nbeyond the nebulae scientific thought has never hitherto ventured.  I\r\nhave tried to state that which I considered ought, in fairness, to be\r\noutspoken.  I neither think this Evolution hypothesis is to be flouted\r\naway contemptuously, nor that it ought to be denounced as wicked.  It\r\nis to be brought before the bar of disciplined reason, and there\r\njustified or condemned.  Let us hearken to those who wisely support\r\nit, and to those who wisely oppose it; and let us tolerate those,\r\nwhose name is legion, who try foolishly to do either of these things.\r\nThe only thing out of place in the discussion is dogmatism on either\r\nside.  Fear not the Evolution hypothesis.  Steady yourselves, in its\r\npresence, upon that faith in the ultimate triumph of truth which was\r\nexpressed by old Gamaliel when he said: 'If it be of God, ye cannot\r\noverthrow it; if it be of man, it will come to nought.' Under the\r\nfierce light of scientific enquiry, it is sure to be dissipated if it\r\npossess not a core of truth.  Trust me, its existence as a hypothesis\r\nis quite compatible with the simultaneous existence of all those\r\nvirtues to which the term 'Christian' has been applied.  It does not\r\nsolve--it does not profess to solve--the ultimate mystery of this\r\nuniverse.  It leaves, in fact, that mystery untouched.  For, granting\r\nthe nebula and its potential life, the question, whence they came,\r\nwould still remain to baffle and bewilder us.  At bottom, the\r\nhypothesis does nothing more than 'transport the conception of life's\r\norigin to an indefinitely distant past.'\r\n\r\nThose who hold the doctrine of Evolution are by no means ignorant of\r\nthe uncertainty of their data, and they only yield to it a provisional\r\nassent.  They regard the nebular hypothesis as probable, and, in the\r\nutter absence of any evidence to prove the act illegal, they extend\r\nthe method of nature from the present into the past. Here the observed\r\nuniformity of nature is their only guide.  Within the long range of\r\nphysical enquiry, they have never discerned in nature the insertion of\r\ncaprice.  Throughout this range, the laws of physical and intellectual\r\ncontinuity have run side by side.  Having thus determined the elements\r\nof their curve in a world of observation and experiment, they prolong\r\nthat curve into an antecedent world, and accept as probable the\r\nunbroken sequence of development from the nebula to the present time.\r\nYou never hear the really philosophical defenders of the doctrine of\r\nUniformity speaking of impossibilities in nature.  They never say,\r\nwhat they are constantly charged with saying, that it is impossible\r\nfor the Builder of the universe to alter His work.  Their business is\r\nnot with the possible, but the actual--not with a world which might\r\nbe, but with a world that is.  This they explore with a courage not\r\nunmixed with reverence, and according to methods which, like the\r\nquality of a tree, are tested by their fruits.  They have but one\r\ndesire--to know the truth.  They have but one fear--to believe a lie.\r\nAnd if they know the strength of science, and rely upon it with\r\nunswerving trust, they also know the limits beyond which science\r\nceases to be strong.  They best know that questions offer themselves\r\nto thought, which science, as now prosecuted, has not even the\r\ntendency to solve.  They have as little fellowship with the atheist\r\nwho says there is no God, as with the theist who professes to know the\r\nmind of God.  'Two things,' said Immanuel Kant, 'fill me with awe: the\r\nstarry heavens, and the sense of moral responsibility in man.' And in\r\nhis hours of health and strength and sanity, when the stroke of action\r\nhas ceased, and the pause of reflection has set in, the scientific\r\ninvestigator finds himself overshadowed by the same awe.  Breaking\r\ncontact with the hampering details of earth, it associates him with a\r\nPower which gives fulness and tone to his existence, but which he can\r\nneither analyse nor comprehend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is one God supreme over all gods, diviner than mortals,\r\n  Whose form is not like unto man's, and as unlike his nature;\r\n  But vain mortals imagine that gods like themselves are begotten,\r\n  With human sensations and voice and corporeal members;\r\n  So, if oxen or lions had hands and could work in man's fashion,\r\n  And trace out with chisel or brush their conception of Godhead,\r\n  Then would horses depict gods like horses, and oxen like oxen,\r\n  Each kind the divine with its own form and nature endowing.\r\n\r\n                         XENOPHANES Of COLOPHON (six centuries B.C.),\r\n                             Supernatural Religion, vol. 1.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.  THE BELFAST ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Delivered before the British Association on Wednesday\r\nevening, August 19, 1874.]\r\n\r\n 1.\r\n\r\nAN impulse inherent in primeval man turned his thoughts and\r\nquestionings betimes towards the sources of natural phenomena.  The\r\nsame impulse, inherited and intensified, is the spur of scientific\r\naction to-day.  Determined by it, by a process of abstraction from\r\nexperience we form physical theories which lie beyond the pale of\r\nexperience, but which satisfy the desire of the mind to see every\r\nnatural occurrence resting upon a cause.  In forming their notions of\r\nthe origin of things, our earliest historic (and doubtless, we might\r\nadd, our prehistoric) ancestors pursued, as far as their intelligence\r\npermitted, the same course.  They also fell back upon experience; but\r\nwith this difference--that the particular experiences which furnished\r\nthe warp and woof of their theories were drawn, not from the study of\r\nnature, but from what lay much closer to them--the observation of\r\nmen.  Their theories accordingly took an anthropomorphic form.  To\r\nsuper-sensual beings, which, 'however potent and invisible, were\r\nnothing but a species of human creatures, perhaps raised from among\r\nmankind, and retaining all human passions and appetites,' were handed\r\nover the rule and governance of natural phenomena. [Footnote: Hume,\r\n'Natural History of Religion.]\r\n\r\nTested by observation and reflection, these early notions failed in\r\nthe long run to satisfy the more penetrating intellects of our race.\r\nFar in the depths of history we find men of exceptional power\r\ndifferentiating themselves from the crowd, rejecting these\r\nanthropomorphic notions, and seeking to connect natural phenomena with\r\ntheir physical principles.  But, long prior to these purer efforts of\r\nthe understanding, the merchant had been abroad, and rendered the\r\nphilosopher possible; commerce had been developed, wealth amassed,\r\nleisure for travel and speculation secured, while races educated under\r\ndifferent conditions, and therefore differently informed and endowed,\r\nhad been stimulated and sharpened by mutual contact.  In those regions\r\nwhere the commercial aristocracy of ancient Greece mingled with their\r\neastern neighbours, the sciences were born, being nurtured and\r\ndeveloped by free-thinking and courageous men.  The state of things to\r\nbe displaced may be gathered from a passage of Euripides quoted by\r\nHume.  'There is nothing in the world; no glory, no prosperity.  The\r\ngods toss all into confusion; mix everything with its reverse, that\r\nall of us, from our ignorance and uncertainty, may pay them the more\r\nworship and reverence.' Now as science demands the radical extirpation\r\nof caprice, and the absolute reliance upon law in nature, there grew,\r\nwith the growth of scientific notions, a desire and determination to\r\nsweep from the field of theory this mob of gods and demons, and to\r\nplace natural phenomena on a basis more congruent with themselves.\r\n\r\nThe problem which had been previously approached from above, was now\r\nattacked from below; theoretic effort passed from the super- to the\r\nsub-sensible.  It was felt that to construct the universe in idea, it\r\nwas necessary to have some notion of its constituent parts--of what\r\nLucretius subsequently called the 'First Beginnings.' Abstracting\r\nagain from experience, the leaders of scientific speculation reached\r\nat length the pregnant doctrine of atoms and molecules, the latest\r\ndevelopments of which were set forth with such power and clearness at\r\nthe last meeting of the British Association.  Thought, no doubt, had\r\nlong hovered about this doctrine before it attained the precision and\r\ncompleteness which it assumed in the mind of Democritus, [Footnote:\r\nBorn 460 B.C.] a philosopher who may well for a moment arrest our\r\nattention.  'Few great men,' says Lange, a non-materialist, in his\r\nexcellent 'History of Materialism,' to the spirit and to the letter\r\nof which I am equally indebted, 'have been so despitefully used by\r\nhistory as Democritus.  In the distorted images sent down to us\r\nthrough unscientific traditions, there remains of him almost nothing\r\nbut the name of \"the laughing philosopher,\" while figures of\r\nimmeasurably smaller significance spread themselves out at full length\r\nbefore us.' Lange speaks of Bacon's high appreciation of\r\nDemocritus--for ample illustrations of which I am indebted to my\r\nexcellent friend Mr. Spedding, the learned editor and biographer of\r\nBacon.  It is evident, indeed, that Bacon considered Democritus to be\r\na man of weightier metal than either Plato or Aristotle, though their\r\nphilosophy 'was noised and celebrated in the schools, amid the din\r\nand pomp of professors.'  It was not they, but Genseric and Attila and\r\nthe barbarians, who destroyed the atomic philosophy.  'For, at a time\r\nwhen all human learning had suffered shipwreck, these planks of\r\nAristotelian and Platonic philosophy, as being of a lighter and more\r\ninflated substance, were preserved and came down to us, while things\r\nmore solid sank and almost passed into oblivion.'\r\n\r\nThe son of a wealthy father, Democritus devoted the whole of his\r\ninherited fortune to the culture of his mind.  He travelled\r\neverywhere; visited Athens when Socrates and Plato were there, but\r\nquitted the city without making himself known.  Indeed, the dialectic\r\nstrife in which Socrates so much delighted, had no charm for\r\nDemocritus, who held that 'the man who readily contradicts, and uses\r\nmany words, is unfit to learn anything truly right.' He is said to\r\nhave discovered and educated Protagoras the Sophist, being struck as\r\nmuch by the manner in which he, being a hewer of wood, tied up his\r\nfaggots, as by the sagacity of his conversation.  Democritus returned\r\npoor from his travels, was supported by his brother, and at length\r\nwrote his great work entitled 'Diakosmos,' which he read publicly\r\nbefore the people of his native town.  He was honoured by his\r\ncountrymen in various ways, and died serenely at a great age.\r\n\r\nThe principles enunciated by Democritus reveal his uncompromising\r\nantagonism to those who deduced the phenomena of nature from the\r\ncaprices of the gods.  They are briefly these:\r\n\r\n1. From nothing comes nothing.  Nothing that exists can be destroyed.\r\nAll changes are due to the combination and separation of molecules.\r\n\r\n2. Nothing happens by chance; every occurrence has its cause, from\r\nwhich it follows by necessity.\r\n\r\n3. The only existing things are the atoms and empty space; all else is\r\nmere opinion.\r\n\r\n4. The atoms are infinite in number and infinitely various in form;\r\nthey strike together, and the lateral motions and whirlings which thus\r\narise are the beginnings of worlds.\r\n\r\n5. The varieties of all things depend upon the varieties of their\r\natoms, in number, size, and aggregation.\r\n\r\n6. The soul consists of fine, smooth, round atoms, like those of fire.\r\nThese are the most mobile of all: they interpenetrate the whole body,\r\nand in their motions the phenomena of life arise.\r\n\r\nThe first five propositions are a fair general statement of the atomic\r\nphilosophy, as now held.  As regards the sixth, Democritus made his\r\nfiner atoms do duty for the nervous system, whose functions were then\r\nunknown.  The atoms of Democritus are individually without sensation;\r\nthey combine in obedience to mechanical laws; and not only organic\r\nforms, but the phenomena of sensation and thought, are the result of\r\ntheir combination.\r\n\r\nThat great enigma, 'the exquisite adaptation of one part of an\r\norganism to another part, and to the conditions of life,' more\r\nespecially the construction of the human body, Democritus made no\r\nattempt to solve.  Empedocles, a man of more fiery and poetic nature,\r\nintroduced the notion of love and hate among the atoms, to account for\r\ntheir combination and separation; and bolder than Democritus, he\r\nstruck in with the penetrating thought, linked, however, with some\r\nwild speculation, that it lay in the very nature of those combinations\r\nwhich were suited to their ends (in other words, in harmony with their\r\nenvironment) to maintain themselves, while unfit combinations, having\r\nno proper habitat, must rapidly disappear.  Thus, more than 2,000\r\nyears ago, the doctrine of the 'survival of the fittest,' which in our\r\nday, not on the basis of vague conjecture, but of positive knowledge,\r\nhas been raised to such extraordinary significance, had received at\r\nall events partial enunciation. [Footnote: See 'Lange,' 2nd edit,\r\np. 23.]\r\n\r\nEpicurus, [Footnote: Born 342 B.C.] said to be the son of a poor\r\nschoolmaster at Samos, is the next dominant figure in the history of\r\nthe atomic philosophy.  He mastered the writings of Democritus, heard\r\nlectures in Athens, went back to Samos, and subsequently wandered\r\nthrough various countries.  He finally returned to Athens, where he\r\nbought a garden, and surrounded himself by pupils, in the midst of\r\nwhom he lived a pure and serene life, and died a peaceful death.\r\nDemocritus looked to the soul as the ennobling part of man; even\r\nbeauty, without understanding, partook of animalism.  Epicurus also\r\nrated the spirit above the body; the pleasure of the body being that\r\nof the moment, while the spirit could draw upon the future and the\r\npast. His philosophy was almost identical with that of Democritus; but\r\nhe never quoted either friend or foe.  One main object of Epicurus was\r\nto free the world from superstition and the fear of death.  Death be\r\ntreated with indifference.  It merely robs us of sensation.  As long\r\nas we are, death is not; and when death is, we are not.  Life has no\r\nmore evil for him who has made up his mind that it is no evil not to\r\nlive.  He adored the gods, but not in the ordinary fashion.  The idea\r\nof Divine power, properly purified, he thought an elevating one.  Still\r\nhe taught, 'Not he is godless who rejects the gods of the crowd, but\r\nrather he who accepts them.'  The gods were to him eternal and immortal\r\nbeings, whose blessedness excluded every thought of care or occupation\r\nof any kind.  Nature pursues her course in accordance with everlasting\r\nlaws, the gods never interfering.  They haunt:\r\n\r\n    The lucid interspace Of world and world\r\n    Where never creeps a cloud or moves a wind,\r\n    Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,\r\n    Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,\r\n    Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar\r\n    Their sacred everlasting calm.\r\n\r\n                  Tennyson's 'Lucretius.'\r\n\r\nLange considers the relation of Epicurus to the gods subjective; the\r\nindication, probably, of an ethical requirement of his own nature.  We\r\ncannot read history with open eyes, or study human nature to its\r\ndepths, and fail to discern such a requirement.  Man never has been,\r\nand he never will be, satisfied with the operations and products of\r\nthe Understanding alone; hence physical science cannot cover all the\r\ndemands of his nature.  But the history of the efforts made to satisfy\r\nthese demands might be broadly described as a history of errors--the\r\nerror, in great part, consisting in ascribing fixity to that which is\r\nfluent, which varies as we vary, being gross when we are gross, and\r\nbecoming, as our capacities widen, more abstract and sublime.  On one\r\ngreat point the mind of Epicurus was at peace.  He neither sought nor\r\nexpected, here or hereafter, any personal profit from his relation to\r\nthe gods.  And it is assuredly a fact, that loftiness and serenity of\r\nthought may be promoted by conceptions which involve no idea of profit\r\nof this kind.  'Did I not believe,' said a great man. [Footnote:\r\nCarlyle.] to me once, 'that an Intelligence is at the heart of\r\nthings, my life on earth would be intolerable.' The utterer of these\r\nwords is not, in my opinion, rendered less but more noble by the fact,\r\nthat it was the need of ethical harmony here, and not the thought of\r\npersonal happiness hereafter, that prompted his observation.\r\n\r\nThere are persons, not belonging to the highest intellectual zone, nor\r\nyet to the lowest, to whom perfect clearness of exposition suggests\r\nwant of depth.  They find comfort and edification in an abstract and\r\nlearned phraseology.  To such people Epicurus, who spared no pains to\r\nrid his style of every trace of haze and turbidity, appeared, on this\r\nvery account, superficial.  He had, however, a disciple who thought it\r\nno unworthy occupation to spend his days and nights in the effort to\r\nreach the clearness of his master, and to whom the Greek philosopher\r\nis mainly indebted for the extension and perpetuation of his fame.\r\nSome two centuries after the death of Epicurus, Lucretius [Footnote:\r\nBorn 99 B.C.] wrote his great poem, 'On the Nature of Things,' in\r\nwhich he, a Roman, developed with extraordinary ardour the philosophy\r\nof his Greek predecessor.  He wishes to win over his friend Memnius to\r\nthe school of Epicurus; and although he has no rewards in a future\r\nlife to offer, although his object appears to be a purely negative\r\none, he addresses his friend with the heat of an apostle.  His object,\r\nlike that of his great forerunner, is the destruction of superstition;\r\nand considering that men in his day trembled before every natural\r\nevent as a direct monition from the gods, and that everlasting torture\r\nwas also in prospect, the freedom aimed at by Lucretius might be\r\ndeemed a positive good.  'This terror,' he says, 'and darkness of\r\nmind, must be dispelled, not by the rays of the sun and glittering\r\nshafts of day, but by the aspect and the law of nature.' He refutes\r\nthe notion that anything can come out of nothing, or that what is once\r\nbegotten can be recalled to nothing.  The first beginnings, the atoms,\r\nare indestructible, and into them all things can be resolved at last.\r\nBodies are partly atoms; and partly combinations of atoms; but the\r\natoms nothing can quench. They are strong in solid singleness, and, by\r\ntheir denser combination, all things can be closely packed and exhibit\r\nenduring strength.  He denies that matter is infinitely divisible.  We\r\ncome at length to the atoms, without which, as an imperishable\r\nsubstratum, all order in the generation and development of things\r\nwould be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical shock of the atoms being, in his view, the\r\nall-sufficient cause of things, he combats the notion that the\r\nconstitution of nature has been in any way determined by intelligent\r\ndesign.  The interaction of the atoms throughout infinite time\r\nrendered all manner of combinations possible.  Of these, the fit ones\r\npersisted, while the unfit ones disappeared.  Not after sage\r\ndeliberation did the atoms station themselves in their right places,\r\nnor did they bargain what motions they should assume.  From all\r\neternity they have been driven together, and, after trying motions and\r\nunions of every kind, they fell at length into the arrangements out\r\nof which this system of things has been evolved.\r\n\r\n'If you will apprehend and keep in mind these things, Nature, free at\r\nonce, and rid of her haughty lords, is seen to do all things\r\nspontaneously of herself, without the meddling of the gods.'\r\n[Footnote: Monro's translation.  In his criticism of this work\r\n('Contemporary Review' 1867) Dr. Hayman does not appear to be aware of\r\nthe really sound and subtile observations on which the reasoning of\r\nLucretius, though erroneous, sometimes rests.]\r\n\r\nTo meet the objection that his atoms cannot be seen, Lucretius\r\ndescribes a violent storm, and shows that the invisible particles of\r\nair act in the same way as the visible particles of water.  We\r\nperceive, moreover, the different smells of things, yet never see them\r\ncoming to our nostrils.  Again, clothes hung up on a shore which waves\r\nbreak upon, become moist, and then get dry if spread out in the sun,\r\nthough no eye can see either the approach or the escape of the\r\nwater-particles.  A ring, worn long on the finger, becomes thinner; a\r\nwater-drop hollows out a stone; the ploughshare is rubbed away in the\r\nfield; the street-pavement is worn by the feet; but the particles that\r\ndisappear at any moment we cannot see.  Nature acts through invisible\r\nparticles.  That Lucretius had a strong scientific imagination the\r\nforegoing references prove.  A fine illustration of his power in this\r\nrespect, is his explanation of the apparent rest of bodies whose atoms\r\nare in motion.  He employs the image of a flock of sheep with skipping\r\nlambs, which, seen from a distance, presents simply a white patch upon\r\nthe green hill, the jumping of the individual lambs being quite\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nHis vaguely grand conception of the atoms falling eternally through\r\nspace, suggested the nebular hypothesis to Kant, its first propounder.\r\nFar beyond the limits of our visible world are to be found atoms\r\ninnumerable, which have never been united to form bodies, or which, if\r\nonce united, have been again dispersed--falling silently through\r\nimmeasurable intervals of time and space.  As everywhere throughout\r\nthe All the same conditions are repeated, so must the phenomena be\r\nrepeated also.  Above us, below us, beside us, therefore, are worlds\r\nwithout end; and this, when considered, must dissipate every thought\r\nof a deflection of the universe by the gods.  The worlds come and go,\r\nattracting new atoms out of limitless space, or dispersing their own\r\nparticles.  The reputed death of Lucretius, which forms the basis of\r\nMr. Tennyson's noble poem, is in strict accordance with his\r\nphilosophy, which was severe and pure.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nStill earlier than these three philosophers, and during the centuries\r\nbetween the first of them and the last, the human intellect was active\r\nin other fields than theirs.  Pythagoras had founded a school of\r\nmathematics, and made his experiments on the harmonic intervals.  The\r\nSophists had run through their career.  At Athens had appeared\r\nSocrates, Plato, and Aristotle, who ruined the Sophists, and whose\r\nyoke remains to some extent unbroken to the present hour.  Within this\r\nperiod also the School of Alexandria was founded, Euclid wrote his\r\n'Elements' and made some advance in optics.  Archimedes had propounded\r\nthe theory of the lever, and the principles of hydrostatics. Astronomy\r\nwas immensely enriched by the discoveries of Hipparchus, who was\r\nfollowed by the historically more celebrated Ptolemy.  Anatomy had\r\nbeen made the basis of scientific medicine; and it is said by Draper\r\nthat vivisection had begun. [Footnote: 'History of the Intellectual\r\nDevelopment of Europe,' p. 295.] In fact, the science of ancient Greece\r\nhad already cleared the world of the fantastic images of divinities\r\noperating capriciously through natural phenomena.  It had shaken itself\r\nfree from that fruitless scrutiny 'by the internal light of the mind\r\nalone,' which had vainly sought to transcend experience, and to reach\r\na knowledge of ultimate causes.  Instead of accidental observation, it\r\nhad introduced observation with a purpose; instruments were employed\r\nto aid the senses; and scientific method was rendered in a great measure\r\ncomplete by the union of Induction and Experiment.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, stopped its victorious advance?  Why was the scientific\r\nintellect compelled, like an exhausted soil, to lie fallow for nearly\r\ntwo millenniums, before it could regather the elements necessary to\r\nits fertility and strength?  Bacon has already let us know one cause;\r\nWhewell ascribes this stationary period to four causes--obscurity of\r\nthought, servility, intolerance of disposition, enthusiasm of temper;\r\nand he gives striking examples of each. [Footnote: 'History of the\r\nInductive Sciences,' vol. i.]  But these characteristics must have\r\nhad their antecedents in the circumstances of the time.  Rome, and the\r\nother cities of the Empire, had fallen into moral putrefaction.\r\nChristianity had appeared, offering the Gospel to the poor, and by\r\nmoderation, if not asceticism of life, practically protesting against\r\nthe profligacy of the age.  The sufferings of the early Christians,\r\nand the extraordinary exaltation of mind which enabled them to triumph\r\nover the diabolical tortures to which they were subjected, must have\r\nleft traces not easily effaced. [Footnote: Described with terrible\r\nvividness in Renan's 'Antichrist.']  They scorned the earth, in view of\r\nthat 'building of God, that house not made with hands, eternal in the\r\nheavens.' The Scriptures which ministered to their spiritual needs\r\nwere also the measure of their Science.  When, for example, the\r\ncelebrated question of Antipodes came to be discussed, the Bible was\r\nwith many the ultimate court of appeal.  Augustine, who flourished\r\nA.D. 400, would not deny the rotundity of the earth; but he would\r\ndeny the possible existence of inhabitants at the other side, 'because\r\nno such race is recorded in Scripture among the descendants of Adam.'\r\nArchbishop Boniface was shocked at the assumption of a 'world of human\r\nbeings out of the reach of the means of salvation.' Thus reined in,\r\nScience was not likely to make much progress.  Later on, the political\r\nand theological strife between the Church and civil governments, so\r\npowerfully depicted by Draper, must have done much to stifle\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nWhewell makes many wise and brave remarks regarding the spirit of the\r\nMiddle Ages.  It was a menial spirit.  The seekers after natural\r\nknowledge had forsaken the fountain of living waters, the direct\r\nappeal to nature by observation and experiment, and given themselves\r\nup to the remanipulation of the notions of their predecessors.  It was\r\na time when thought had become abject, and when the acceptance of mere\r\nauthority led, as it always does in science, to intellectual death.\r\nNatural events, instead of being traced to physical, were referred to\r\nmoral, causes; while an exercise of the phantasy, almost as degrading\r\nas the spiritualism of the present day, took the place of scientific\r\nspeculation.  Then came the mysticism of the Middle Ages, Magic,\r\nAlchemy, the Neoplatonic philosophy, with its visionary though sublime\r\nabstractions, which caused men to look with shame upon their own\r\nbodies, as hindrances to the absorption of the creature in the\r\nblessedness of the Creator.  Finally came the scholastic philosophy, a\r\nfusion, according to Lange, of the least mature notions of Aristotle\r\nwith the Christianity of the West. Intellectual immobility was the\r\nresult.  As a traveller without a compass in a fog may wander long,\r\nimagining he is making way, and find himself after hours of toil at\r\nhis starting-point, so the schoolmen, having 'tied and untied the same\r\nknots, and formed and dissipated the same clouds,' found themselves\r\nat the end of centuries in their old position. [Footnote: Whewell.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the influence wielded by Aristotle in the Middle Ages,\r\nand which, to a less extent, he still wields, I would ask permission\r\nto make one remark.\r\n\r\nWhen the human mind has achieved greatness and given evidence of\r\nextraordinary power in one domain, there is a tendency to credit it\r\nwith similar power in all other domains.  Thus theologians have\r\nfound comfort and assurance in the thought that Newton dealt with\r\nthe question of revelation--forgetful of the fact that the very\r\ndevotion of his powers, through all the best years of his life, to\r\na totally different class of ideas, not to speak of any natural\r\ndisqualification, tended to render him less, instead of more competent\r\nto deal with theological and historic questions.  Goethe, starting\r\nfrom his established greatness as a poet, and indeed from his positive\r\ndiscoveries in Natural History, produced a profound impression among\r\nthe painters of Germany, when he published his 'Farbenlehre,' in\r\nwhich he endeavoured to overthrow Newton's theory of colours.  This\r\ntheory he deemed so obviously absurd, that he considered its author a\r\ncharlatan, and attacked him with a corresponding vehemence of\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nIn the domain of Natural History, Goethe had made really considerable\r\ndiscoveries; and we have high authority for assuming that, had he\r\ndevoted himself wholly to that side of science, he might have reached\r\nan eminence comparable with that which he attained as a poet.  In\r\nsharpness of observation, in the detection of analogies apparently\r\nremote, in the classification and organisation of facts according to\r\nthe analogies discerned, Goethe possessed extraordinary powers.  These\r\nelements of scientific enquiry fall in with the disciplines of the\r\npoet.  But, on the other hand, a mind thus richly endowed in the\r\ndirection of natural history, may be almost shorn of endowment as\r\nregards the physical and mechanical sciences.  Goethe was in this\r\ncondition.  He could not formulate distinct mechanical conceptions; he\r\ncould not see the force of mechanical reasoning; and, in regions where\r\nsuch reasoning reigns supreme, he became a mere ignis fatuus to those\r\nwho followed him.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes permitted myself to compare Aristotle with Goethe--to\r\ncredit the Stagirite with an almost superhuman power of amassing and\r\nsystematising facts, but to consider him fatally defective on that\r\nside of the mind, in respect to which incompleteness has been just\r\nascribed to Goethe.  Whewell refers the errors of Aristotle not to a\r\nneglect of facts, but to 'a neglect of the idea appropriate to the\r\nfacts: the idea of Mechanical cause, which is Force, and the\r\nsubstitution of vague or inapplicable notions, involving only\r\nrelations of space or emotions of wonder.' This is doubtless true; but\r\nthe word 'neglect' implies mere intellectual misdirection, whereas in\r\nAristotle, as in Goethe, it was not, I believe, misdirection, but\r\nsheer natural incapacity which lay at the root of his mistakes.  As a\r\nphysicist, Aristotle displayed what we should consider some of the\r\nworst of attributes in a modern physical investigator--indistinctness\r\nof ideas, confusion of mind, and a confident use of language which led\r\nto the delusive notion that he had really mastered his subject, while\r\nhe had, as yet, failed to grasp even the elements of it.  He put\r\nwords in the place of things, subject in the place of object.  He\r\npreached Induction without practising it, inverting the true order of\r\nenquiry, by passing from the general to the particular, instead of\r\nfrom the particular to the general.  He made of the universe a closed\r\nsphere, in the centre of which he fixed the earth, proving from\r\ngeneral principles, to his own satisfaction and to that of the world\r\nfor near 2,000 years, that no other universe was possible.  His\r\nnotions of motion were entirely unphysical.  It was natural or\r\nunnatural, better or worse, calm or violent--no real mechanical\r\nconception regarding it lying at the bottom of his mind.\r\n\r\nHe affirmed that a vacuum could not exist, and proved that if it did\r\nmotion in it would be impossible.  He determined _à priori_ how many\r\nspecies of animals must exist, and showed on general principles why\r\nanimals must have such and such parts.  When an eminent contemporary\r\nphilosopher, who is far removed from errors of this kind, remembers\r\nthese abuses of the _à priori_ method, he will be able to make allowance\r\nfor the jealousy of physicists as to the acceptance of so-called _à\r\npriori_ truths.  Aristotle's errors of detail, as shown by Eucken and\r\nLange, were grave and numerous.  He affirmed that only in man we had\r\nthe beating of the heart, that the left side of the body was colder\r\nthan the right, that men have more teeth than women, and that there is\r\nan empty space at the back of every man's head.\r\n\r\nThere is one essential quality in physical conceptions, which was\r\nentirely wanting in those of Aristotle and his followers--a capability\r\nof being placed as coherent pictures before the mind.  The Germans\r\nexpress the act of picturing by the word vorstellen, and the picture\r\nthey call a Vorstellung.  We have no word in English which comes\r\nnearer to our requirements than Imagination; and, taken with its\r\nproper limitations, the word answers very well.  But it is tainted by\r\nits associations, and therefore objectionable to some minds.  Compare,\r\nwith reference to this capacity of mental presentation, the case of\r\nthe Aristotelian, who refers the ascent of water in a pump to Nature's\r\nabhorrence of a vacuum, with that of Pascal when he proposed to solve\r\nthe question of atmospheric pressure by the ascent of the Puy de Dôme.\r\nIn the one case the terms of the explanation refuse to fall into place\r\nas a physical image; in the other the image is distinct, the descent\r\nand rise of the barometer being clearly figured beforehand as the\r\nbalancing of two varying and opposing pressures.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nDuring the drought of the Middle Ages in Christendom, the Arabian\r\nintellect, as forcibly shown by Draper, was active.  With the\r\nintrusion of the Moors into Spain, order, learning, and refinement\r\ntook the place of their opposites.  When smitten with disease, the\r\nChristian peasant resorted to a shrine, the Moorish one to an\r\ninstructed physician.  The Arabs encouraged translations from the\r\nGreek philosophers, but not from the Greek poets.  They turned in\r\ndisgust 'from the lewdness of our classical mythology, and denounced\r\nas an unpardonable blasphemy all connection between the impure\r\nOlympian Jove and the Most High God.'  Draper traces still farther\r\nthan Whewell the Arab elements in our scientific terms.  He gives\r\nexamples of what Arabian men of science accomplished, dwelling\r\nparticularly on Alhazen, who was the first to correct the Platonic\r\nnotion that rays of light are emitted by the eye.  Alhazen discovered\r\natmospheric refraction, and showed that we see the sun and the moon\r\nafter they have set.  He explained the enlargement of the sun and\r\nmoon, and the shortening of the vertical diameters of both these\r\nbodies when near the horizon.  He was aware that the atmosphere\r\ndecreases in density with increase of elevation, and actually fixed\r\nits height at 58.5 miles.  In the 'Book of the Balance of Wisdom,' he\r\nsets forth the connection between the weight of the atmosphere and its\r\nincreasing density.  He shows that a body will weigh differently in a\r\nrare and dense atmosphere, and he considers the force with which\r\nplunged bodies rise through heavier media.  He understood the doctrine\r\nof the centre of gravity, and applied it to the investigation of\r\nbalances and steelyards.  He recognised gravity as a.  force, though\r\nhe fell into the error of assuming it to diminish simply as the\r\ndistance, and of making it purely terrestrial.  He knew the relation\r\nbetween the velocities, spaces, and times of falling bodies, and had\r\ndistinct ideas of capillary attraction.  He improved the hydrometer.\r\nThe determinations of the densities of bodies, as given by Alhazen,\r\napproach very closely to our own.  'I join,' says Draper, 'in the\r\npious prayer of Alhazen, that in the day of judgment the All-Merciful\r\nwill take pity on the soul of Abur-Raihân, because he was the first of\r\nthe race of men to construct a table of specific gravities.' If all\r\nthis be historic truth (and I have entire confidence in Dr. Draper),\r\nwell may he 'deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of\r\nEurope has, contrived to put out of sight our scientific obligations\r\nto the Mahommedans.' [Footnote: Intellectual Development of Europe,'\r\np. 359.]\r\n\r\nThe strain upon the mind during the stationary period towards\r\nultra-terrestrial things, to the neglect of problems close at hand,\r\nwas sure to provoke reaction.  But the reaction was gradual; for the\r\nground was dangerous, and a power was at hand competent to crush the\r\ncritic who went too far.  To elude this power, and still allow\r\nopportunity for the expression of opinion, the doctrine of 'two-fold\r\ntruth' was invented, according to which an opinion might be held\r\n'theologically,' and the opposite opinion 'philosophically.'\r\n[Footnote: 'Lange,' 2nd edit.  pp. 181, 182.]  Thus, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the creation of the world in six days, and the\r\nunchangeableness of the individual soul, which had been so distinctly\r\naffirmed by St. Thomas Aquinas, were both denied philosophically, but\r\nadmitted to be true as articles of the Catholic faith.  When\r\nProtagoras uttered the maxim which brought upon him so much\r\nvituperation, that 'opposite assertions are equally true,' he simply\r\nmeant to affirm men's differences to be so great, that what was\r\nsubjectively true to the one might be subjectively untrue to the\r\nother.  The great Sophist never meant to play fast and loose with the\r\ntruth by saying that one of two opposite assertions, made by the same\r\nindividual, could possibly escape being a lie.  It was not\r\n'sophistry,' but the dread of theologic vengeance, that generated this\r\ndouble dealing with conviction; and it is astonishing to notice what\r\nlengths were allowed to men who were adroit in the use of artifices\r\nof this kind.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the stationary period a word-weariness, if I may\r\nso express it, took more and more possession of men's minds.\r\nChristendom had become sick of the School Philosophy and its verbal\r\nwastes, which led to no issue, but left the intellect in everlasting\r\nhaze.  Here and there was heard the voice of one impatiently crying in\r\nthe wilderness, 'Not unto Aristotle, not unto subtle hypothesis, not\r\nunto church, Bible, or blind tradition, must we turn for a knowledge\r\nof the universe, but to the direct investigation of nature by\r\nobservation and experiment.' In 1543 the epoch-marking work of\r\nCopernicus on the paths of the heavenly bodies appeared.  The total\r\ncrash of Aristotle's closed universe, with the earth at its centre,\r\nfollowed as a consequence, and 'The earth moves!' became a kind of\r\nwatchword among intellectual freemen.  Copernicus was Canon of the\r\nchurch of Frauenburg in the diocese of Ermeland.  For three-and-thirty\r\nyears he had withdrawn himself from the world, and devoted himself to\r\nthe consolidation of his great scheme of the solar system.  He made\r\nits blocks eternal; and even to those who feared it, and desired its\r\noverthrow, it was so obviously strong, that they refrained for a time\r\nfrom meddling with it.  In the last year of the life of Copernicus his\r\nbook appeared: it is said that the old man received a copy of it a few\r\ndays before his death, and then departed in peace.\r\n\r\nThe Italian philosopher, Giordano Bruno, was one of the earliest\r\nconverts to the new astronomy.  Taking Lucretius as his exemplar, he\r\nrevived the notion of the infinity of worlds; and, combining with it\r\nthe doctrine of Copernicus, reached the sublime generalisation that\r\nthe fixed stars are suns, scattered numberless through space, and\r\naccompanied by satellites, which bear the same relation to them that\r\nour earth does to our sun, or our moon to our earth.  This was an\r\nexpansion of transcendent import; but Bruno came closer than this to\r\nour present line of thought.  Struck with the problem of the\r\ngeneration and maintenance of organisms, and duly pondering it, he\r\ncame to the conclusion that Nature, in her productions, does not\r\nimitate the technic of man.  Her process is one of unravelling and\r\nunfolding.  The infinity of forms under which matter appears was not\r\nimposed upon it by an external artificer; by its own intrinsic force\r\nand virtue it brings these forms forth.  Matter is not the mere naked,\r\nempty capacity which philosophers have pictured her to be, but the\r\nuniversal mother, who brings forth all things as the fruit of her own\r\nwomb.\r\n\r\nThis outspoken man was originally a Dominican monk.  He was accused of\r\nheresy and had to fly, seeking refuge in Geneva, Paris, England, and\r\nGermany.  In 1592 be fell into the hands of the Inquisition at Venice.\r\nHe was imprisoned for many years, tried, degraded, excommunicated, and\r\nhanded over to the Civil power, with the request that he should be\r\ntreated gently, and 'without the shedding of blood.' This meant that\r\nhe was to be burnt; and burnt accordingly he was, on February 16,\r\n1600.  To escape a similar fate Galileo, thirty-three years\r\nafterwards, abjured upon his knees, with his hands upon the holy\r\nGospels, the heliocentric doctrine, which he knew to be true.  After\r\nGalileo came Kepler, who from his German home defied the ultramontane\r\npower.  He traced out from pre-existing observations the laws of\r\nplanetary motion.  Materials were thus prepared for Newton, who bound\r\nthose empirical laws together by the principle of gravitation.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century Bacon and Descartes, the restorers of\r\nphilosophy, appeared in succession.  Differently educated and endowed,\r\ntheir philosophic tendencies were different.  Bacon held fast to\r\nInduction, believing firmly in the existence of an external world, and\r\nmaking collected experiences the basis of all knowledge.  The\r\nmathematical studies of Descartes gave him a bias towards Deduction;\r\nand his fundamental principle was much the same as that of Protagoras,\r\nwho 'made the individual man the measure of all things.  I think,\r\ntherefore I am,' said Descartes.  Only his own identity was sure to\r\nhim; and the full development of this system would have led to an\r\nidealism, in which the outer world would have been resolved into a\r\nmere phenomenon of consciousness.  Gassendi, one of Descartes's\r\ncontemporaries, of whom we shall hear more presently, quickly pointed\r\nout that the fact of personal existence would be proved as well by\r\nreference to any other act, as to the act of thinking.  I eat,\r\ntherefore I am, or I love, therefore I am, would be quite as\r\nconclusive.  Lichtenberg, indeed, showed that the very thing to be\r\nproved was inevitably postulated in the first two words, 'I think;'\r\nand it is plain that no inference from the postulate could, by any\r\npossibility, be stronger than the postulate itself.\r\n\r\nBut Descartes deviated strangely from the idealism implied in his\r\nfundamental principle.  He was the first to reduce, in a manner\r\neminently capable of bearing the test of mental presentation, vital\r\nphenomena to purely mechanical principles.  Through fear or love,\r\nDescartes was a good churchman; he accordingly rejected the notion of\r\nan atom, because it was absurd to suppose that God, if He so pleased,\r\ncould not divide an atom; he puts in the place-of the atoms small\r\nround particles, and light splinters, out of which he builds the\r\norganism.  He sketches with marvellous physical insight a machine,\r\nwith water for its motive power, which shall illustrate vital actions.\r\nHe has made clear to his mind that such a machine would be competent\r\nto carry on the processes of digestion, nutrition, growth,\r\nrespiration, and the beating of the heart.  It would be competent to\r\naccept impressions from the external sense, to store them up in\r\nimagination and memory, to go through the internal movements of the\r\nappetites and passions, and the external movements of the limbs.  He\r\ndeduces these functions of his machine from the mere arrangements of\r\nits organs, as the movement of a clock, or other automaton, is deduced\r\nfrom its weights and wheels.  As far as these functions are\r\nconcerned,' he says, 'it is not necessary to conceive any other\r\nvegetative or sensitive soul, nor any other principle of motion or of\r\nlife, than the blood and the spirits agitated by the fire which burns\r\ncontinually in the heart, and which is in nowise different from the\r\nfires existing in inanimate bodies.' Had Descartes been acquainted\r\nwith the steam-engine, he would have taken it, instead of a fall of\r\nwater, as his motive power.  He would have shown the perfect analogy\r\nwhich exists between the oxidation of the food in the body, and that\r\nof the coal in the furnace.  He would assuredly have anticipated Mayer\r\nin calling the blood which the heart diffuses, 'the oil of the lamp of\r\nlife,' deducing all animal motions from the combustion of this oil, as\r\nthe motions of a steam-engine are deduced from the combustion of its\r\ncoal.  As the matter stands, however, and considering the\r\ncircumstances of the time, the boldness, clearness, and precision,\r\nwith which Descartes grasped the problem of vital dynamics constitute\r\na marvellous illustration of intellectual power. [Footnote: See\r\nHuxley's admirable 'Essay on Descartes.' Lay Sermons.]\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages the doctrine of atoms had to all appearance\r\nvanished from discussion.  It probably held its ground among\r\nsober-minded and thoughtful men, though neither the church nor the\r\nworld was prepared to hear of it with tolerance.  Once, in the year\r\n1348, it received distinct expression.  But retractation by compulsion\r\nimmediately followed; and, thus discouraged, it slumbered till the\r\nseventeenth century, when it was revived by a contemporary and friend\r\nof Hobbes of Malmesbury, the orthodox Catholic provost of Digne,\r\nGassendi.  But, before stating his relation to the Epicurean doctrine,\r\nit will be well to say a few words on the effect, as regards science,\r\nof the general introduction of monotheism among European nations.\r\n\r\n'Were men,' says Hume, 'led into the apprehension of invisible\r\nintelligent power by contemplation of the works of Nature, they could\r\nnever possibly entertain any conception but of one single Being, who\r\nbestowed existence and order on this vast machine, and adjusted all\r\nits parts to one regular system.' Referring to the condition of the\r\nheathen, who sees a god behind every natural event, thus peopling the\r\nworld with thousands of beings whose caprices are incalculable, Lange\r\nshows the impossibility of any compromise between such notions and\r\nthose of science, which proceeds on the assumption of never-changing\r\nlaw and causality.  'But,' he continues, with characteristic\r\npenetration, 'when the great thought of one God, acting as a unit upon\r\nthe universe, has been seized, the connection of things in accordance\r\nwith the law of cause and effect is not only thinkable, but it is a\r\nnecessary consequence of the assumption.  For when I see ten thousand\r\nwheels in motion, and know, or believe, that they are all driven by\r\none motive power, then I know that I have before me a mechanism, the\r\naction of every part of which is determined by the plan of the whole.\r\nSo much being assumed, it follows that I may investigate the structure\r\nof that machine, and the various motions of its parts.  For the time\r\nbeing, therefore, this conception renders scientific action free.' In\r\nother words, were a capricious God at the circumference of every wheel\r\nand at the end of every lever, the action of the machine would be\r\nincalculable by the methods of science.  But the actions of all its\r\nparts being rigidly determined by their connections and relations, and\r\nthese being brought into play by a single motive power, then though\r\nthis last prime mover may elude me, I am still able to comprehend the\r\nmachinery which it sets in motion.  We have here a conception of the\r\nrelation of Nature to its Author, which seems perfectly acceptable to\r\nsome minds, but perfectly intolerable to others.  Newton and Boyle\r\nlived and worked happily under the influence of this conception;\r\nGoethe rejected it with vehemence, and the same repugnance to\r\naccepting it is manifest in Carlyle. [Footnote: Boyle's model of the\r\nuniverse was the Strasburg clock with an outside Artificer.  Goethe,\r\non the other hand, sang:\r\n\r\n    'Ihm ziemt's die Welt im Innern zu bewegen,\r\n     Natur in sich, sich in Natur zu hegen.'\r\n\r\nSee also Carlyle, 'Past and Present,' chap. v.]\r\n\r\nThe analytic and synthetic tendencies of the human mind are traceable\r\nthroughout history, great writers ranging themselves sometimes on the\r\none side, sometimes on the other.  Men of warm feelings, and minds\r\nopen to the elevating impressions produced by nature as a whole, whose\r\nsatisfaction, therefore, is rather ethical than logical, lean to the\r\nsynthetic side; while the analytic harmonises best with the more\r\nprecise and more mechanical bias which seeks the satisfaction of the\r\nunderstanding.  Some form of pantheism was usually adopted by the one,\r\nwhile a detached Creator, working more or less after the manner of\r\nmen, was often assumed by the other.  Gassendi, as sketched by Lange,\r\nis hardly to be ranked with either.  Having formally acknowledged God\r\nas the great first cause, he immediately dropped the idea, applied the\r\nknown laws of mechanics to the atoms, and deduced from them all vital\r\nphenomena.  He defended Epicurus, and dwelt upon his purity, both of\r\ndoctrine and of life.  True he was a heathen, but so was Aristotle.\r\nEpicurus assailed superstition and religion, and rightly, because he\r\ndid not know the true religion.  He thought that the gods neither\r\nrewarded nor punished, and he adored them purely in consequence of\r\ntheir completeness: here we see, says Gassendi, the reverence of the\r\nchild, instead of the fear of the slave.  The errors of Epicurus shall\r\nbe corrected, and the body of his truth retained.  Gassendi then\r\nproceeds, as any heathen might have done, to build up the world, and\r\nall that therein is, of atoms and molecules.  God, who created earth\r\nand water, plants and animals, produced in the first place a definite\r\nnumber of atoms, which constituted the seed of all things.  Then began\r\nthat series of combinations and decompositions which now goes on, and\r\nwhich will continue in future.  The principle of every change resides\r\nin matter.  In artificial productions the moving principle is\r\ndifferent from the material worked upon; but in nature the agent works\r\nwithin, being the most active and mobile part of the material itself.\r\nThus this bold ecclesiastic, without incurring the censure of the\r\nchurch or the world, contrives to outstrip Mr. Darwin.  The same cast\r\nof mind which caused him to detach the Creator from his universe, led\r\nhim also to detach the soul from the body, though to the body he\r\nascribes an influence so large as to render the soul almost\r\nunnecessary.  The aberrations of reason were, in his view, an affair\r\nof the material brain.  Mental disease is brain disease; but then the\r\nimmortal reason sits apart, and cannot be touched by the disease.  The\r\nerrors of madness are those of the instrument, not of the performer.\r\n\r\nIt may be more than a mere result of education, connecting itself,\r\nprobably, with the deeper mental structure of the two men, that the\r\nidea of Gassendi, above enunciated, is substantially the same as that\r\nexpressed by Professor Clerk Maxwell, at the close of the very able\r\nlecture delivered by him at Bradford in 1873.  According to both\r\nphilosophers, the atoms, if I understand aright, are prepared\r\nmaterials, which, formed once for all by the Eternal, produce by their\r\nsubsequent interaction all the phenomena of the material world.  There\r\nseems to be this difference, however, between Gassendi and Maxwell.\r\nThe one postulates, the other infers his first cause.  In his\r\n'manufactured articles,' as he calls the atoms, Professor Maxwell\r\nfinds the basis of an induction, which enables him to scale\r\nphilosophic heights considered inaccessible by Kant, and to take the\r\nlogical step from the atoms to their Maker.\r\n\r\nAccepting here the leadership of Kant, I doubt the legitimacy of\r\nMaxwell's logic; but it is impossible not to feel the ethic glow with\r\nwhich his lecture concludes.  There is, moreover, a very noble strain\r\nof eloquence in his description of the steadfastness of the atoms:\r\nNatural causes, as we know, are at work, which tend to modify, if they\r\ndo not at length destroy, all the arrangements and dimensions of the\r\nearth and the whole solar system.  But though in the course of ages\r\ncatastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in the heavens, though\r\nancient systems may be dissolved and new systems evolved out of their\r\nruins, the molecules out of which these systems are built--the\r\nfoundation stones of the material universe--remain unbroken and\r\nunworn.'\r\n\r\nThe atomic doctrine, in whole or in part, was entertained by Bacon,\r\nDescartes, Hobbes, Locke, Newton, Boyle, and their successors, until\r\nthe chemical law of multiple proportions enabled Dalton to confer upon\r\nit an entirely new significance.  In our day there are secessions from\r\nthe theory, but it still stands firm.  Loschmidt, Stoney, and Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson have sought to determine the sizes of the atoms, or\r\nrather to fix the limits between which their sizes lie; while the\r\ndiscourses of Williamson and Maxwell delivered in Bradford in 1873\r\nillustrate the present hold of the doctrine upon the foremost\r\nscientific minds.  In fact, it may be doubted whether, wanting this\r\nfundamental conception, a theory of the material universe is capable\r\nof scientific statement.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nNinety years subsequent to Gassendi the doctrine of bodily\r\ninstruments, as it may be called, assumed immense importance in the\r\nhands of Bishop Butler, who, in his famous 'Analogy of Religion,'\r\ndeveloped, from his own point of view, and with consummate sagacity, a\r\nsimilar idea.  The Bishop still influences many superior minds; and it\r\nwill repay us to dwell for a moment on his views.  He draws the\r\nsharpest distinction between our real selves and our bodily\r\ninstruments.  He does not, as far as I remember, use the word soul,\r\npossibly because the term was so hackneyed in his day, as it had been\r\nfor many generations previously.  But he speaks of 'living powers,'\r\n'perceiving or percipient powers,' 'moving agents,' 'ourselves,' in\r\nthe same sense as we should employ the term soul.  He dwells upon the\r\nfact that limbs may be removed, and mortal diseases assail the body,\r\nthe mind, almost up to the moment of death, remaining clear.  He\r\nrefers to sleep and to swoon, where the 'living powers' are suspended\r\nbut not destroyed.  He considers it quite as easy to conceive of\r\nexistence out of our bodies as in them; that we may animate a\r\nsuccession of bodies, the dissolution of all of them having no more\r\ntendency to dissolve our real selves, or 'deprive us of living\r\nfaculties--the faculties of perception and action--than the\r\ndissolution of any foreign matter which we are capable of receiving\r\nimpressions from, or making use of for the common occasions of life.'\r\nThis is the key of the Bishop's position: 'our organised bodies are\r\nno more a part of ourselves than any other matter around us.' In proof\r\nof this he calls attention to the use of glasses, which 'prepare\r\nobjects' for the 'percipient power' exactly as the eye does.  The eye\r\nitself is no more percipient than the glass; is quite as much the\r\ninstrument of the true self, and also as foreign to the true self, as\r\nthe glass is.  'And if we see with our eyes only in the same manner as\r\nwe do with glasses, the like may justly be concluded from analogy of\r\nall our senses.'\r\n\r\nLucretius, as you are aware, reached a precisely opposite conclusion:\r\nand it certainly would be interesting, if not profitable, to us all,\r\nto hear what he would or could urge in opposition to the reasoning of\r\nthe Bishop.  As a brief discussion of the point will enable us to see\r\nthe bearings of an important question, I will here permit a disciple\r\nof Lucretius to try the strength of the Bishop's position, and then\r\nallow the Bishop to retaliate, with the view of rolling back, if he\r\ncan, the difficulty upon Lucretius.\r\n\r\nThe argument might proceed in this fashion:\r\n\r\n'Subjected to the test of mental presentation (Vorstellung), your\r\nviews, most honoured prelate, would offer to many minds a great, if\r\nnot an insuperable, difficulty.  You speak of \"living powers,\"\r\n\"percipient or perceiving powers,\" and \"ourselves;\" but can you form a\r\nmental picture of any of these, apart from the organism through which\r\nit is supposed to act?  Test yourself honestly, and see whether you\r\npossess any faculty that would enable you to form such a conception.\r\nThe true self has a local habitation in each of us; thus localised,\r\nmust it not possess a form?  If so, what form?  Have you ever for a\r\nmoment realised it?  When a leg is amputated the body is divided into\r\ntwo parts; is the true self in both of them or in one?  Thomas Aquinas\r\nmight say in both; but not you, for you appeal to the consciousness\r\nassociated with one of the two parts, to prove that the other is\r\nforeign matter.  Is consciousness, then, a necessary element of the\r\ntrue self?  If so, what do you say to the case of the whole body being\r\ndeprived of consciousness?  If not, then on what grounds do you deny\r\nany portion of the true self to the severed limb?  It seems very\r\nsingular that from the beginning to the end of your admirable book\r\n(and no one admires its sober strength more than I do), you never once\r\nmention the brain or nervous system.  You begin at one end of the\r\nbody, and show that its parts may be removed without prejudice to the\r\nperceiving power.  What if you begin at the other end, and remove,\r\ninstead of the leg, the brain?  The body, as before, is divided into\r\ntwo parts; but both are now in the same predicament, and neither can\r\nbe appealed to to prove that the other is foreign matter.  Or, instead\r\nof going so far as to remove the brain itself, let a certain portion\r\nof its bony covering be removed, and let a rhythmic series of\r\npressures and relaxations of pressure be applied to the soft\r\nsubstance.  At every pressure \"the faculties of perception and of\r\naction\" vanish; at every relaxation of pressure they are restored.\r\nWhere, during the intervals of pressure, is the perceiving power?  I\r\nonce had the discharge of a large Leyden battery passed unexpectedly\r\nthrough me: I felt nothing, but was simply blotted out of conscious\r\nexistence for a sensible interval.  Where was my true self during that\r\ninterval?  Men who have recovered from lightning-stroke have been much\r\nlonger in the same state; and indeed in cases of ordinary concussion\r\nof the brain, days may elapse during which no experience is registered\r\nin consciousness.  Where is the man himself during the period of\r\ninsensibility?  You may say that I beg the question when I assume the\r\nman to have been unconscious, that he was really conscious all the\r\ntime, and has simply forgotten what had occurred to him.  In reply to\r\nthis, I can only say that no one need shrink from the worst tortures\r\nthat superstition ever invented, if only so felt and so remembered.  I\r\ndo not think your theory of instruments goes at all to the bottom of\r\nthe matter.  A telegraph-operator has his instruments, by means of\r\nwhich he converses with the world; our bodies possess a nervous\r\nsystem, which plays a similar part between the perceiving power and\r\nexternal things.  Cut the wires of the operator, break his battery,\r\ndemagnetise his needle; by this means you certainly sever his\r\nconnection with the world; but, inasmuch as these are real\r\ninstruments, their destruction does not touch the man who uses them.\r\nThe operator survives, and he knows that he survives.  What is there,\r\nI would ask, in the human system that answers to this conscious\r\nsurvival of the operator when the battery of the brain is so disturbed\r\nas to produce insensibility, or when it is destroyed altogether?\r\n\r\n'Another consideration, which you may regard as slight, presses upon\r\nme with some force.  The brain may change from health to disease, and\r\nthrough such a change the most exemplary man may be converted into a\r\ndebauchee or a murderer.  My very noble and approved good master had,\r\nas you know, threatenings of lewdness introduced into his brain by his\r\njealous wife's philter; and sooner than permit himself to run even the\r\nrisk of yielding to these base promptings he slew himself.  How could\r\nthe hand of Lucretius have been thus turned against himself if the\r\nreal Lucretius remained as before?  Can the brain or can it not act in\r\nthis distempered way without the intervention of the immortal reason?\r\nIf it can, then it is a prime mover which requires only healthy\r\nregulation to render it reasonably self-acting, and there is no\r\napparent need of your immortal reason at all.  If it cannot, then the\r\nimmortal reason, by its mischievous activity in operating upon a\r\nbroken instrument, must have the credit of committing every imaginable\r\nextravagance and crime.\r\n\r\nI think, if you will allow me to say so, that the gravest consequences\r\nare likely to flow from your estimate of the body.  To regard the\r\nbrain as you would a staff or an eyeglass--to shut your eyes to all\r\nits mystery, to the perfect correlation of its condition and our\r\nconsciousness, to the fact that a slight excess or defect of blood in\r\nit produces the very swoon to which you refer, and that in relation to\r\nit our meat, and drink, and air, and exercise, have a perfectly\r\ntranscendental value and significance--to forget all this does, I\r\nthink, open a way to innumerable errors in our habits of life, and may\r\npossibly, in some cases, initiate and foster that very disease, and\r\nconsequent mental ruin, which a wiser appreciation of this mysterious\r\norgan would have avoided.'\r\n\r\nI can imagine the Bishop thoughtful after hearing this argument.  He\r\nwas not the man to allow anger to mingle with the consideration of a\r\npoint of this kind.  After due reflection, and having strengthened\r\nhimself by that honest contemplation of the facts which was habitual\r\nwith him, and which includes the desire to give even adverse\r\nreasonings their due weight, I can suppose the Bishop to proceed thus:\r\n'You will remember that in the \"Analogy of Religion,\" of which you\r\nhave so kindly spoken, I did not profess to prove anything absolutely,\r\nand that I over and over again acknowledged and insisted on the\r\nsmallness of our knowledge, or rather the depth of our ignorance, as\r\nregards the whole system of the universe.  My object was to show my\r\ndeistical friends, who set forth so eloquently the beauty and\r\nbeneficence of Nature and the Ruler thereof, while they had nothing\r\nbut scorn for the so-called absurdities of the Christian scheme, that\r\nthey were in no better condition than we were, and that, for every\r\ndifficulty found upon our side, quite as great a difficulty was to be\r\nfound upon theirs.  I will now, with your permission, adopt a similar\r\nline of argument.  You are a Lucretian, and from the combination and\r\nseparation of insensate atoms deduce all terrestrial things, including\r\norganic forms and their phenomena.  Let me tell you in the first\r\ninstance how far I am prepared to go with you.  I admit that you can\r\nbuild crystalline forms out of this play of molecular force; that the\r\ndiamond, amethyst, and snow-star are truly wonderful structures which\r\nare thus produced.  I will go farther and acknowledge that even a tree\r\nor flower might in this way be organised.  Nay, if you can show me an\r\nanimal without sensation, I will concede to you that it also might be\r\nput together by the suitable play of molecular force.\r\n\r\n'Thus far our way is clear, but now comes my difficulty.  Your atoms\r\nare individually without sensation, much more are they without\r\nintelligence.  May I ask you, then, to try your hand upon this\r\nproblem.  Take your dead hydrogen atoms, your dead oxygen atoms, your\r\ndead carbon atoms, your dead nitrogen atoms, your dead phosphorus\r\natoms, and all the other atoms, dead as grains of shot, of which the\r\nbrain is formed.  Imagine them separate and sensationless; observe\r\nthem running together and forming all imaginable combinations.  This,\r\nas a purely mechanical process, is seeable by the mind.  But can you\r\nsee, or dream, or in any way imagine, how out of that mechanical act,\r\nand from these individually dead atoms, sensation, thought, and\r\nemotion are to rise?  Are you likely to extract Homer out of the\r\nrattling of dice, or the Differential Calculus out of the clash of\r\nbilliard-balls?  I am not all bereft of this Vorstellungs-Kraft of\r\nwhich you speak, nor am I, like so many of my brethren, a mere vacuum\r\nas regards scientific knowledge.  I can follow a particle of musk\r\nuntil it reaches the olfactory nerve; I can follow the waves of sound\r\nuntil their tremors reach the water of the labyrinth, and set the\r\notoliths and Corti's fibres in motion; I can also visualise the waves\r\nof aether as they cross the eye and hit the retina.  Nay more, I am\r\nable to pursue to the central organ the motion thus imparted at the\r\nperiphery, and to see in idea the very molecules of the brain thrown\r\ninto tremors.  My insight is not baffled by these physical processes.\r\nWhat baffles and bewilders me is the notion that from those physical\r\ntremors things so utterly incongruous with them as sensation, thought,\r\nand emotion can be derived.  You may say, or think, that this issue of\r\nconsciousness from the clash of atoms is not more incongruous than the\r\nflash of light from the union of oxygen and hydrogen.  But I beg to\r\nsay that it is.  For such incongruity as the flash possesses is that\r\nwhich I now force upon your attention.  The 'flash' is an affair of\r\nconsciousness, the objective counterpart of which is a vibration.  It\r\nis a flash only by your interpretation.  You are the cause of the\r\napparent incongruity; and you are the thing that puzzles me.  I need\r\nnot remind you that the great Leibnitz felt the difficulty which I\r\nfeel; and that to get rid of this monstrous deduction of life from\r\ndeath he displaced your atoms by his monads, which were more or less\r\nperfect mirrors of the universe, and out of the summation and\r\nintegration of which he supposed all the phenomena of life--sentient,\r\nintellectual, and emotional--to arise.\r\n\r\n'Your difficulty, then, as I see you are ready to admit, is quite as\r\ngreat as mine.  You cannot satisfy the human understanding in its\r\ndemand for logical continuity between molecular processes and the\r\nphenomena of consciousness.  This is a rock on which Materialism must\r\ninevitably split whenever it pretends to be a complete philosophy of\r\nlife.  What is the moral, my Lucretian?  You and I are not likely to\r\nindulge in ill-temper in the discussion of these great topics, where\r\nwe see so much room for honest differences of opinion.  But there are\r\npeople of less wit or more bigotry (I say it with humility), on both\r\nsides, who are ever ready to mingle anger and vituperation with such\r\ndiscussions.  There are, for example, writers of note and influence at\r\nthe present day, who are not ashamed publicly to assume the \"deep\r\npersonal sin\" of a great logician to be the cause of his unbelief in a\r\ntheologic dogma. [Footnote: This is the aspect under which the late\r\nEditor of the 'Dublin Review' presented to his readers the memory of\r\nJohn Stuart Mill.  I can only say, that I would as soon take my chance\r\nin the other world, in the company of the 'unbeliever,' as in that of\r\nhis Jesuit detractor.  In Dr. Ward we have an example of a wholesome\r\nand vigorous nature, soured and perverted by a poisonous creed.] 'And\r\nthere are others who hold that we, who cherish our noble Bible,\r\nwrought as it has been into the constitution of our forefathers, and\r\nby inheritance into us, must necessarily be hypocritical and\r\ninsincere.  Let us disavow and discountenance such people, cherishing\r\nthe unswerving faith that what is good and true in both our arguments\r\nwill be preserved for the benefit of humanity, while all that is bad\r\nor false will disappear.'\r\n\r\nI hold the Bishop's reasoning to be unanswerable, and his liberality\r\nto be worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remarking that in one respect the Bishop was a product of\r\nhis age.  Long previous to his day the nature of the soul had been so\r\nfavourite and general a topic of discussion, that, when the students\r\nof the Italian Universities wished to know the leanings of a new\r\nProfessor, they at once requested him to lecture upon the soul.  About\r\nthe time of Bishop Butler the question was not only agitated but\r\nextended.  It was seen by the clear-witted men who entered this arena,\r\nthat many of their best arguments applied equally to brutes and men.\r\nThe Bishop's arguments were of this character.  He saw it, admitted\r\nit, took the consequence, and boldly embraced the whole animal world\r\nin his scheme of immortality.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nBishop Butler accepted with unwavering trust the chronology of the Old\r\nTestament, describing it as confirmed by the natural and civil history\r\nof the world, collected from common historians, from the state of the\r\nearth, and from the late inventions of arts and sciences.' These words\r\nmark progress; and they must seem somewhat hoary to the Bishop's\r\nsuccessors of today.  It is hardly necessary to inform you that since\r\nhis time the domain of the naturalist has been immensely extended--the\r\nwhole science of geology, with its astounding revelations regarding\r\nthe life of the ancient earth, having been created.  The rigidity of\r\nold conceptions has been relaxed, the public mind being rendered\r\ngradually tolerant of the idea that not for six thousand, nor for\r\nsixty thousand, nor for six thousand thousand, but for aeons embracing\r\nuntold millions of years, this earth has been the theatre of life and\r\ndeath.  The riddle of the rocks has been read by the geologist and\r\npalaeontologist, from sub-Cambrian depths to the deposits thickening\r\nover the sea-bottoms of today.  And upon the leaves of that stone book\r\nare, as you know, stamped the characters, plainer and surer than those\r\nformed by the ink of history, which carry the mind back into abysses\r\nof past time, compared with which the periods which satisfied Bishop\r\nButler cease to have a visual angle.\r\n\r\nThe lode of discovery once struck, those petrified forms in which life\r\nwas at one time active, increased to multitudes and demanded\r\nclassification.  They were grouped in genera, species, and varieties,\r\naccording to the degree of similarity subsisting between them.  Thus\r\nconfusion was avoided, each object being found in the pigeon-hole\r\nappropriated to it and to its fellows of similar morphological or\r\nphysiological character.  The general fact soon became evident that\r\nnone but the simplest forms of life lie lowest down; that, as we climb\r\nhigher among the superimposed strata, more perfect forms appear. The\r\nchange, however, from form to form was not continuous, but by\r\nsteps--some small, some great.  'A section,' says Mr. Huxley, 'a\r\nhundred feet thick will exhibit at different heights a dozen species\r\nof Ammonite, none of which passes beyond the particular zone of\r\nlimestone, or clay, into the zone below it, or into that above it.' In\r\nthe presence of such facts it was not possible to avoid the question:\r\nHave these forms, showing, though in broken stages, and with many\r\nirregularities, this unmistakable general advance, being subjected to\r\nno continuous law of growth or variation? Had our education been\r\npurely scientific, or had it been sufficiently detached from\r\ninfluences which, however ennobling in another domain, have always\r\nproved hindrances and delusions when introduced as factors into the\r\ndomain of physics, the scientific mind never could have swerved from\r\nthe search for a law of growth, or allowed itself to accept the\r\nanthropomorphism which regarded each successive stratum as a kind of\r\nmechanic's bench for the manufacture of new species out of all\r\nrelation to the old.\r\n\r\nBiassed, however, by their previous education, the great majority of\r\nnaturalists invoked a special creative act to account for the\r\nappearance of each new group of organisms.  Doubtless numbers of them\r\nwere clearheaded enough to see that this was no explanation at\r\nall--that, in point of fact, it was an attempt, by the introduction of\r\na greater difficulty, to account for a less.  But, having nothing to\r\noffer in the way of explanation, they for the most part held their\r\npeace.  Still the thoughts of reflecting men naturally and necessarily\r\nsimmered round the question.  De Maillet, a contemporary of Newton,\r\nhas been brought into notice by Professor Huxley as one who 'had a\r\nnotion of the modifiability of living forms.'  The late Sir Benjamin\r\nBrodie, a man of highly philosophic mind, often drew my attention to\r\nthe fact that, as early as 1794, Charles Darwin's grandfather was\r\nthe pioneer of Charles Darwin. [Footnote: Zoonomia,' vol. i.\r\npp.500-510.]  In 1801, and in subsequent years, the celebrated Lamarck,\r\nwho, through the vigorous exposition of his views by the author of the\r\n'Vestiges of Creation,' rendered the public mind perfectly familiar\r\nwith the idea of evolution, endeavoured to show the development of\r\nspecies out of changes of habit and external condition.  In 1813 Dr.\r\nWells, the founder of our present theory of Dew, read before the Royal\r\nSociety a paper in which, to use the words of Mr. Darwin, 'he\r\ndistinctly recognises the principle of natural selection; and this is\r\nthe first recognition that has been indicated.' The thoroughness and\r\nskill with which Wells pursued his work, and the obvious independence\r\nof his character, rendered him long ago a favourite with me; and it\r\ngave me the liveliest pleasure to alight upon this additional\r\ntestimony to his penetration.  Professor Grant, Mr. Patrick Matthew,\r\nvon Buch, the author of the 'Vestiges,' D'Halloy, and others, by the\r\nenunciation of opinions more or less clear and correct, showed that\r\nthe question had been fermenting long prior to the year 1858, when Mr.\r\nDarwin and Mr. Wallace simultaneously, but independently, placed their\r\nclosely concurrent views before the Linnean Society. [Footnote: In\r\n1855 Mr. Herbert Spencer ('Principles of Psychology,' 2nd edit.\r\nvol. i. p. 465) expressed 'the belief that life under all its forms has\r\narisen by an unbroken evolution, and through the instrumentality of\r\nwhat are called natural causes.' This was my belief also at that\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\nThese papers were followed in 1859 by the publication of the first\r\nedition of the 'Origin of Species.' All great things come slowly to\r\nthe birth.  Copernicus, as I informed you, pondered his great work for\r\nthirty-three years.  Newton for nearly twenty years kept the idea of\r\nGravitation before his mind; for twenty years also he dwelt upon his\r\ndiscovery of Fluxions, and doubtless would have continued to make it\r\nthe object of his private thought, had he not found Leibnitz upon his\r\ntrack.  Darwin for two-and-twenty years pondered the problem of the\r\norigin of species, and doubtless he would have continued to do so had\r\nhe not found Wallace upon his track. [Footnote: The behaviour of Mr.\r\nWallace in relation to this subject has been dignified in the highest\r\ndegree.]  A concentrated, but full and powerful, epitome of his\r\nlabours was the consequence.  The book was by no means an easy one;\r\nand probably not one in every score of those who then attacked it, had\r\nread its pages through, or were competent to grasp their significance\r\nif they had.  I do not say this merely to discredit them: for there\r\nwere in those days some really eminent scientific men, entirely raised\r\nabove the heat of popular prejudice, and willing to accept any\r\nconclusion that science had to offer, provided it was duly backed by\r\nfact and argument, who entirely mistook Mr. Darwin's views.  In fact,\r\nthe work needed an expounder, and it found one in Mr. Huxley.  I know\r\nnothing more admirable in the way of scientific exposition than those\r\nearly articles of his on the origin of species.  He swept the curve of\r\ndiscussion through the really significant points of the subject,\r\nenriched his exposition with profound original remarks and\r\nreflections, often summing up in a single pithy sentence an argument\r\nwhich a less compact mind would have spread over pages.  But there is\r\none impression made by the book itself which no exposition of it,\r\nhowever luminous, can convey; and that is the impression of the vast\r\namount of labour, both of observation and of thought, implied in its\r\nproduction.  Let us glance at its principles.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded on all hands that what are called varieties' are\r\ncontinually produced.  The rule is probably without exception.  No\r\nchick, or child, is in all respects and particulars the counterpart of\r\nits brother and sister; and in such differences we have 'variety'\r\nincipient.  No naturalist could tell how far this variation could be\r\ncarried; but the great mass of them held that never, by any amount of\r\ninternal or external change, nor by the mixture of both, could the\r\noffspring of the same progenitor so far deviate from each other as to\r\nconstitute different species.  The function of the experimental\r\nphilosopher is to combine the conditions of Nature and to produce her\r\nresults; and this was the method of Darwin. [Footnote: The first step\r\nonly towards experimental demonstration has been taken.  Experiments\r\nnow begun might, a couple of centuries hence, furnish data of\r\nincalculable value, which ought to be supplied to the science of the\r\nfuture.]  He made himself acquainted with what could, without any\r\nmanner of doubt, be done in the way of producing variation.  He\r\nassociated himself with pigeon-fanciers--bought, begged, kept, and\r\nobserved every breed that he could obtain.  Though derived from a\r\ncommon stock, the diversities of these pigeons were such that 'a score\r\nof them might be chosen which, if shown to an ornithologist, and he\r\nwere told that they were wild birds, would certainly be ranked by him\r\nas well-defined species.' The simple principle which guides the\r\npigeon-fancier, as it does the cattle-breeder, is the selection of\r\nsome variety that strikes his fancy, and the propagation of this\r\nvariety by inheritance.  With his eye still directed to the particular\r\nappearance which he wishes to exaggerate, he selects it as it\r\nreappears in successive broods, and thus adds increment to increment\r\nuntil an astonishing amount of divergence from the parent type is\r\neffected.  The breeder in this case does not produce the elements of\r\nthe variation.  He simply observes them, and by selection adds them\r\ntogether until the required result has been obtained.  'No man,' says\r\nMr. Darwin, 'would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon\r\nwith a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a\r\npouter until he saw a pigeon with a crop of unusual size.' Thus nature\r\ngives the hint, man acts upon it, and by the law of inheritance\r\nexaggerates the deviation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus satisfied himself by indubitable facts that the\r\norganisation of an animal or of a plant (for precisely the same\r\ntreatment applies to plants).  is to some extent plastic, he passes\r\nfrom variation under domestication to variation under nature. Hitherto\r\nwe have dealt with the adding together of small changes by the\r\nconscious selection of man.  Can Nature thus select?  Mr. Darwin's\r\nanswer is, 'Assuredly she can.' The number of living things produced\r\nis far in excess of the number that can be supported; hence at some\r\nperiod or other of their lives there must be a struggle for existence.\r\nAnd what is the infallible result?  If one organism were a perfect\r\ncopy of the other in regard to strength, skill, and agility, external\r\nconditions would decide.  But this is not the case. Here we have the\r\nfact of variety offering itself to nature, as in the former instance\r\nit offered itself to man; and those varieties which are least\r\ncompetent to cope with surrounding conditions will infallibly give way\r\nto those that are most competent.  To use a familiar proverb, the\r\nweakest goes to the wall.  But the triumphant fraction again breeds to\r\nover-production, transmitting the qualities which secured its\r\nmaintenance, but transmitting them in different degrees.  The struggle\r\nfor food again supervenes, and those to whom the favourable quality\r\nhas been transmitted in excess, will triumph as before.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that we have here the addition of increments\r\nfavourable to the individual, still more rigorously carried out than\r\nin the case of domestication; for not only are unfavourable specimens\r\nnot selected by nature, but they are destroyed.  This is what Mr.\r\nDarwin calls 'Natural Selection,' which acts by the preservation and\r\naccumulation of small inherited modifications, each profitable to the\r\npreserved being.  With this idea he interpenetrates and leavens the\r\nvast store of facts that he and others have collected.  We cannot,\r\nwithout shutting our eyes through fear or prejudice, fail to see that\r\nDarwin is here dealing, not with imaginary, but with true causes; nor\r\ncan we fail to discern what vast modifications may be produced by\r\nnatural selection in periods sufficiently long.  Each individual\r\nincrement may resemble what mathematicians call a 'differential' (a\r\nquantity indefinitely small); but definite and great changes may\r\nobviously be produced by the integration of these infinitesimal\r\nquantities, through practically infinite time.\r\n\r\nIf Darwin, like Bruno, rejects the notion of creative power, acting\r\nafter human fashion, it certainly is not because he is unacquainted\r\nwith the numberless exquisite adaptations, on which this notion of a\r\nsupernatural Artificer has been founded.  His book is a repository of\r\nthe most startling facts of this description.  Take the marvellous\r\nobservation which he cites from Dr. Krueger, where a bucket, with an\r\naperture serving as a spout, is formed in an orchid.  Bees visit the\r\nflower: in eager search of material for their combs, they push each\r\nother into the bucket, the drenched ones escaping from their\r\ninvoluntary bath by the spout.  Here they rub their backs against the\r\nviscid stigma of the flower and obtain glue; then against the pollen\r\nmasses, which are thus stuck to the back of the bee and carried away.\r\n'When the bee, so provided, flies to another flower, or to the same\r\nflower a second time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket,\r\nand then crawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass upon its back\r\nnecessarily comes first into contact with the viscid stigma,' which\r\ntakes up the pollen; and this is how that orchid is fertilised.  Or\r\ntake this other case of the Catasetum 'Bees visit these flowers in\r\norder to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch a\r\nlong, tapering, sensitive projection.  This, when touched, transmits a\r\nsensation or vibration to a certain membrane, which is instantly\r\nruptured, setting free a spring, by which the pollen-mass is shot\r\nforth like an arrow in the right direction, and adheres by its viscid\r\nextremity to the back of the bee.'  In this way the fertilising pollen\r\nis spread abroad.\r\n\r\nIt is the mind thus stored with the choicest materials of the\r\nteleologist that rejects teleology, seeking to refer these wonders to\r\nnatural causes.  They illustrate, according to him, the method of\r\nnature, not the 'technic' of a manlike Artificer.  The beauty of\r\nflowers is due to natural selection.  Those that distinguish\r\nthemselves by vividly contrasting colours from the surrounding green\r\nleaves are most readily seen, most frequently visited by insects, most\r\noften fertilised, and hence most favoured by natural selection.\r\nColoured berries also readily attract the attention of birds and\r\nbeasts, which feed upon them, spread their manured seeds abroad, thus\r\ngiving trees and shrubs possessing such berries a greater chance in\r\nthe struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nWith profound analytic and synthetic skill, Mr. Darwin investigates\r\nthe cell-making instinct of the hive-bee.  His method of dealing with\r\nit is representative.  He falls back from the more perfectly to the\r\nless perfectly developed instinct--from the hive-bee to the humble\r\nbee, which uses its own cocoon as a comb, and to classes of bees of\r\nintermediate skill, endeavouring to show how the passage might be\r\ngradually made from the lowest to the highest. The saving of wax is\r\nthe most important point in the economy of bees.  Twelve to fifteen\r\npounds of dry sugar are said to be needed for the secretion of a\r\nsingle pound of wax.  The quantities of nectar necessary for the wax\r\nmust therefore be vast; and every improvement of constructive instinct\r\nwhich results in the saving of wax is a direct profit to the insect's\r\nlife.  The time that would otherwise be devoted to the making of wax,\r\nis devoted to the gathering and storing of honey for winter food.  Mr.\r\nDarwin passes from the humble bee with its rude cells, through the\r\nMelipona with its more artistic cells, to the hive-bee with its\r\nastonishing architecture.  The bees place themselves at equal\r\ndistances apart upon the wax, sweep and excavate equal spheres round\r\nthe selected points.  The spheres intersect, and the planes of\r\nintersection are built up with thin laminae.  Hexagonal cells are thus\r\nformed.  This mode of treating such questions is, as I have said,\r\nrepresentative.  The expositor habitually retires from the more\r\nperfect and complex, to the less perfect and simple, and carries you\r\nwith him through stages of perfecting--adds increment to increment of\r\ninfinitesimal change, and in this way gradually breaks down your\r\nreluctance to admit that the exquisite climax of the whole could be a\r\nresult of natural selection.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin shirks no difficulty; and, saturated as the subject was\r\nwith his own thought, he must have known, better than his critics, the\r\nweakness as well as the strength of his theory.  This of course would\r\nbe of little avail were his object a temporary dialectic victory,\r\ninstead of the establishment of a truth which he means to be\r\neverlasting.  But he takes no pains to disguise the weakness he has\r\ndiscerned; nay, he takes every pains to bring it into the strongest\r\nlight.  His vast resources enable him to cope with objections started\r\nby himself and others, so as to leave the final impression upon the\r\nreader's mind that, if they be not completely answered, they certainly\r\nare not fatal.  Their negative force being thus destroyed, you are\r\nfree to be influenced by the vast positive mass of evidence he is able\r\nto bring before you.  This largeness of knowledge, and readiness of\r\nresource, render Mr. Darwin the most terrible of antagonists.\r\nAccomplished naturalists have levelled heavy and sustained criticisms\r\nagainst him--not always with the view of fairly weighing his theory,\r\nbut with the express intention of exposing its weak points only.  This\r\ndoes not irritate him.  He treats every objection with a soberness and\r\nthoroughness which even Bishop Butler might be proud to imitate,\r\nsurrounding each fact with its appropriate detail, placing it in its\r\nproper relations, and usually giving it a significance which, as long\r\nas it was kept isolated, failed to appear.  This is done without a\r\ntrace of ill-temper.  He moves over the subject with the passionless\r\nstrength of a glacier; and the grinding of the rocks is not always\r\nwithout a counterpart in the logical pulverisation of the objector.\r\nBut though in handling this mighty theme all passion has been stilled,\r\nthere is an emotion of the intellect, incident to the discernment of\r\nnew truth, which often colours and warms the pages of Mr. Darwin.\r\n\r\nHis success has been great; and this implies not only the solidity of\r\nhis work, but the preparedness of the public mind for such a\r\nrevelation.  On this head, a remark of Agassiz impressed me more than\r\nanything else.  Sprung from a race of theologians, this celebrated man\r\ncombated to the last the theory of natural selection.  One of the many\r\ntimes I had the pleasure of meeting him in the United States was at\r\nMr. Winthrop's beautiful residence at Brookline, near Boston.  Rising\r\nfrom luncheon, we all halted as if by common consent, in front of a\r\nwindow, and continued there a discussion which had been started at\r\ntable.  The maple was in its autumn glory, and the exquisite beauty of\r\nthe scene outside seemed, in my case, to interpenetrate without\r\ndisturbance the intellectual action.  Earnestly, almost sadly, Agassiz\r\nturned, and said to the gentlemen standing round, 'I confess that I\r\nwas not prepared to see this theory received as it has been by the\r\nbest intellects of our time.  Its success is greater than I could have\r\nthought possible.'\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nIn our day grand generalisations have been reached.  The theory of the\r\norigin of species is but one of them.  Another, of still wider grasp\r\nand more radical significance, is the doctrine of the Conservation of\r\nEnergy, the ultimate philosophical issues of which are as yet but\r\ndimly seen--that doctrine which 'binds nature fast in fate,' to an\r\nextent not hitherto recognised, exacting from every antecedent its\r\nequivalent consequent, from every consequent its equivalent\r\nantecedent, and bringing vital as well as physical phenomena under the\r\ndominion of that law of causal connection which, so far as the human\r\nunderstanding has yet pierced, asserts itself everywhere in nature.\r\nLong in advance of all definite experiment upon the subject, the\r\nconstancy and indestructibility of matter had been affirmed; and all\r\nsubsequent experience justified the affirmation.  Mayer extended the\r\nattribute of indestructibility to energy, applying it in the first\r\ninstance to inorganic, and afterwards with profound insight to organic\r\nnature. [Footnote: Dr. Berthold has shown that Leibnitz had sound views\r\nregarding the conservation of energy in inorganic nature.]  The\r\nvegetable world, though drawing all its nutriment from invisible\r\nsources, was proved incompetent to generate anew either matter or\r\nforce.  Its matter is for the most part transmuted gas; its force\r\ntransformed solar force.  The animal world was proved to be equally\r\nuncreative, all its motive energies being referred to the combustion\r\nof its food.  The activity of each animal, as a whole, was proved to\r\nbe the transferred activity of its molecules.  The muscles were shown\r\nto be stores of mechanical energy, potential until unlocked by the\r\nnerves, and then resulting in muscular contractions.  The speed at\r\nwhich messages fly to and fro along the nerves was determined by\r\nHelmholtz, and found to be, not, as had been previously supposed,\r\nequal to that of light or electricity, but less than the speed of\r\nsound--less even than that of an eagle.\r\n\r\nThis was the work of the physicist: then came the conquests of the\r\ncomparative anatomist and physiologist, revealing the structure of\r\nevery animal, and the function of every organ in the whole biological\r\nseries, from the lowest zoophyte up to man.  The nervous system had\r\nbeen made the object of profound and continued study, the wonderful\r\nand, at bottom, entirely mysterious controlling power which it\r\nexercises over the whole organism, physical and mental, being\r\nrecognised more and more.  Thought could not be kept back from a\r\nsubject so profoundly suggestive.  Besides the physical life dealt\r\nwith by Mr. Darwin, there is a psychical life presenting similar\r\ngradations, and asking equally for a solution.  How are the different\r\ngrades and orders of Mind to be accounted for?  What is the principle\r\nof growth of that mysterious power which on our planet culminates in\r\nReason?  These are questions which, though not thrusting themselves so\r\nforcibly upon the attention of the general public, had not only\r\noccupied many reflecting minds, but had been formally broached by one\r\nof them before the 'Origin of Species' appeared.\r\n\r\nWith the mass of materials furnished by the physicist and physiologist\r\nin his hands, Mr. Herbert Spencer, twenty years ago, sought to graft\r\nupon this basis a system of psychology; and two years ago a second and\r\ngreatly amplified edition of his work appeared.  Those who have\r\noccupied themselves with the beautiful experiments of Plateau will\r\nremember that when two spherules of olive-oil suspended in a mixture\r\nof alcohol and water of the same density as the oil, are brought\r\ntogether, they do not immediately unite.  Something like a pellicle\r\nappears to be formed around the drops, the rupture of which is\r\nimmediately followed by the coalescence of the globules into one.\r\nThere are organisms whose vital actions are almost as purely physical\r\nas the coalescence of such drops of oil.  They come into contact and\r\nfuse themselves thus together.  From such organisms to others a shade\r\nhigher, from these to others a shade higher still, and on through an\r\never-ascending series, Mr. Spencer conducts his argument.  There are\r\ntwo obvious factors to be here taken into account--the creature and\r\nthe medium in which it lives, or, as it is often expressed, the\r\norganism and its environment.  Mr. Spencer's fundamental principle is,\r\nthat between these two factors there is incessant interaction.  The\r\norganism is played upon by the environment, and is modified to meet\r\nthe requirements of the environment.  Life he defines to be 'a\r\ncontinuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest organisms we have a kind of tactual sense diffused over\r\nthe entire body; then, through impressions from without and their\r\ncorresponding adjustments, special portions of the surface become more\r\nresponsive to stimuli than others.  The senses are nascent, the basis\r\nof all of them being that simple tactual sense which the sage\r\nDemocritus recognised 2,300 years ago as their common progenitor.  The\r\naction of light, in the first instance, appears to be a mere\r\ndisturbance of the chemical processes in the animal organism, similar\r\nto that which occurs in the leaves of plants.  By degrees the action\r\nbecomes localised in a few pigment-cells, more sensitive to light than\r\nthe surrounding tissue.  The eye is incipient.  At first it is merely\r\ncapable of revealing differences of light and shade produced by bodies\r\nclose at hand.  Followed, as the interception of the light commonly\r\nis, by the contact of the closely adjacent opaque body, sight in this\r\ncondition becomes a kind of 'anticipatory touch.' The adjustment\r\ncontinues; a slight bulging out of the epidermis over the\r\npigment-granules supervenes.  A lens is incipient, and, through the\r\noperation of infinite adjustments, at length reaches the perfection\r\nthat it displays in the hawk and eagle.  So of the other senses; they\r\nare special differentiations of a tissue which was originally vaguely\r\nsensitive all over.\r\n\r\nWith the development of the senses, the adjustments between the\r\norganism and its environment gradually extend in space, a\r\nmultiplication of experiences and a corresponding modification of\r\nconduct being the result.\r\n\r\nThe adjustments also extend in time, covering continually greater\r\nintervals.  Along with this extension in space and time the\r\nadjustments also increase in speciality and complexity, passing\r\nthrough the various grades of brute life, and prolonging themselves\r\ninto the domain of reason.  Very striking are Mr. Spencer's remarks\r\nregarding the influence of the sense of touch upon the development of\r\nintelligence.  This is, so to say, the mother-tongue of all the\r\nsenses, into which they must be translated to be of service to the\r\norganism.  Hence its importance.  The parrot is the most intelligent\r\nof birds, and its tactual power is also greatest. From this sense it\r\ngets knowledge, unattainable by birds which cannot employ their feet\r\nas hands.  The elephant is the most sagacious of quadrupeds--its\r\ntactual range and skill, and the consequent multiplication of\r\nexperiences, which it owes to its wonderfully adaptable trunk, being\r\nthe basis of its sagacity.  Feline animals, for a similar cause, are\r\nmore sagacious than hoofed animals,--atonement being to some extent\r\nmade in the case of the horse, by the possession of sensitive\r\nprehensile lips.  In the Primates the evolution of intellect and the\r\nevolution of tactual appendages go hand in hand.  In the most\r\nintelligent anthropoid apes we find the tactual range and delicacy\r\ngreatly augmented, new avenues of knowledge being thus opened to the\r\nanimal.  Alan crowns the edifice here, not only in virtue of his own\r\nmanipulatory power, but through the enormous extension of his range of\r\nexperience, by the invention of instruments of precision, which serve\r\nas supplemental senses and supplemental limbs.  The reciprocal action\r\nof these is finely described and illustrated That chastened\r\nintellectual emotion to which I have referred in connection with Mr.\r\nDarwin, is not absent in Mr. Spencer.  His illustrations possess at\r\ntimes exceeding vividness and force; and from his style on such\r\noccasions it is to be inferred, that the ganglia of this Apostle of\r\nthe Understanding are sometimes the seat of a nascent poetic thrill.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of supreme importance that actions, the performance of\r\nwhich at first requires even painful effort and deliberation, may, by\r\nhabit, be rendered automatic.  Witness the slow learning of its\r\nletters by a child, and the subsequent facility of reading in a man,\r\nwhen each group of letters which forms a word is instantly, and\r\nwithout effort, fused to a single perception.  Instance the\r\nbilliard-player, whose muscles of hand and eye, when he reaches the\r\nperfection of his art, are unconsciously co-ordinated.  Instance the\r\nmusician, who, by practice, is enabled to fuse a multitude of\r\narrangements, auditory, tactual, and muscular, into a process of\r\nautomatic manipulation.  Combining such facts with the doctrine of\r\nhereditary transmission, we reach a theory of Instinct.  A chick,\r\nafter coming out of the egg, balances itself correctly, runs about,\r\npicks up food, thus snowing that it possesses a power of directing its\r\nmovements to definite ends.  How did the chick learn this very complex\r\nco-ordination of eyes, muscles, and beak?  It has not been\r\nindividually taught; its personal experience is nit; but it has the\r\nbenefit of ancestral experience.  In its inherited organisation are\r\nregistered the powers which it displays at birth.  So also as regards\r\nthe instinct of the hive-bee, already referred to.  The distance at\r\nwhich the insects stand apart when they sweep their hemispheres and\r\nbuild their cells is 'organically remembered.' Man also carries with\r\nhim the physical texture of his ancestry, as well as the inherited\r\nintellect bound up with it.  The defects of intelligence during\r\ninfancy and youth are probably less due to a lack of individual\r\nexperience, than to the fact that in early life the cerebral\r\norganisation is still incomplete.  The period necessary for completion\r\nvaries with the race, and with the individual.  As a round shot\r\noutstrips the rifled bolt on quitting the muzzle of the gun, so the\r\nlower race, in childhood, may outstrip the higher.  But the higher\r\neventually overtakes the lower, and surpasses it in range.  As regards\r\nindividuals, we do not always find the precocity of youth prolonged to\r\nmental power in maturity; while the dulness of boyhood is sometimes\r\nstrikingly contrasted with the intellectual energy of after years.\r\nNewton, when a boy, was weakly, and he showed no particular aptitude\r\nat school; but in his eighteenth year he went to Cambridge, and soon\r\nafterwards astonished his teachers by his power of dealing with\r\ngeometrical problems.  During his quiet youth his brain was slowly\r\npreparing itself to be the organ of those energies which he\r\nsubsequently displayed.\r\n\r\nBy myriad blows (to use a Lucretian phrase) the image and\r\nsuperscription of the external world are stamped as states of\r\nconsciousness upon the organism, the depth of the impression depending\r\non the number of the blows.  When two or more phenomena occur in the\r\nenvironment invariably together, they are stamped to the same depth or\r\nto the same relief, and indissolubly connected.  And here we come to\r\nthe threshold of a great question.  Seeing that he could in no way rid\r\nhimself of the consciousness of Space and Time, Kant assumed them to\r\nbe necessary 'forms of intuition,' the moulds and shapes into which\r\nour intuitions are thrown, belonging to ourselves, and without\r\nobjective existence.  With unexpected power and success, Mr. Spencer\r\nbrings the hereditary experience theory, as he holds it, to bear upon\r\nthis question.  'If there exist certain external relations which are\r\nexperienced by all organisms at all instants of their waking\r\nlives--relations which are absolutely constant and universal--there\r\nwill be established answering internal relations, that are absolutely\r\nconstant and universal.  Such relations we have in those of Space and\r\nTime.  As the substratum of all other relations of the Non-Ego, they\r\nmust be responded to by conceptions that are the substrata of all\r\nother relations in the Ego.  Being the constant and infinitely\r\nrepeated elements of thought, they must become the automatic elements\r\nof thought--the elements of thought which it is impossible to get rid\r\nof--the \"forms of intuition.\"'\r\n\r\nThroughout this application and extension of Hartley's and Mill's 'Law\r\nof Inseparable Association,' Mr. Spencer stands upon his own ground,\r\ninvoking, instead of the experiences of the individual, the registered\r\nexperiences of the race.  His overthrow of the restriction of\r\nexperience to the individual is, I think, complete.  That restriction\r\nignores the power of organising experience, furnished at the outset to\r\neach individual; it ignores the different degrees of this power\r\npossessed by different races, and by different individuals of the same\r\nrace.  Were there not in the human brain a potency antecedent to all\r\nexperience, a dog or a cat ought to be as capable of education as man.\r\nThese predetermined internal relations are independent of the\r\nexperiences of the individual.  The human brain is the 'organised\r\nregister of infinitely numerous experiences received during the\r\nevolution of life, or rather during the evolution of that series of\r\norganisms through which the human organism has been reached.  The\r\neffects of the most uniform and frequent of these experiences have\r\nbeen successively bequeathed, principal and interest, and have slowly\r\nmounted to that high intelligence which lies latent in the brain of\r\nthe infant.  Thus it happens that the European inherits from twenty to\r\nthirty cubic inches more of brain than the Papuan.  Thus it happens\r\nthat faculties, as of music, which scarcely exist in some inferior\r\nraces, become congenital in superior ones.  Thus it happens that out\r\nof savages unable to count up to the number of their fingers, and\r\nspeaking a language containing only nouns and verbs, arise at length\r\nour Newtons and Shakspeares.'\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of this Address it was stated that physical theories\r\nwhich lie beyond experience are derived by a process of abstraction\r\nfrom experience.  It is instructive to note from this point of view\r\nthe successive introduction of new conceptions.  The idea of the\r\nattraction of gravitation was preceded by the observation of the\r\nattraction of iron by a magnet, and of light bodies by rubbed amber.\r\nThe polarity of magnetism and electricity also appealed to the senses.\r\nIt thus became the substratum of the conception that atoms and\r\nmolecules are endowed with attractive and repellent poles, by the play\r\nof which definite forms of crystalline architecture are produced. Thus\r\nmolecular force becomes structural. [Footnote: See Art. on Matter and\r\nForce, or 'Lectures on Light,' No. III.]  It required no great\r\nboldness of thought to extend its play into organic nature, and to\r\nrecognise in molecular force the agency by which both plants and\r\nanimals are built up.  In this way, out of experience arise\r\nconceptions which are wholly ultra-experiential.  None of the atomists\r\nof antiquity had any notion of this play of molecular polar force, but\r\nthey had experience of gravity, as manifested by falling bodies.\r\nAbstracting from this, they permitted their atoms to fall eternally\r\nthrough empty space.  Democritus assumed that the larger atoms moved\r\nmore rapidly than the smaller ones, which they therefore could\r\novertake, and with which they could combine.  Epicurus, holding that\r\nempty space could offer no resistance to motion, ascribed to all the\r\natoms the same velocity; but he seems to have overlooked the\r\nconsequence that under such circumstances the atoms could never\r\ncombine.  Lucretius cut the knot by quitting the domain of physics\r\naltogether, and causing the atoms to move together by a kind of\r\nvolition.\r\n\r\nWas the instinct utterly at fault which caused Lucretius thus to\r\nswerve from his own principles?  Diminishing gradually the number of\r\nprogenitors, Mr. Darwin comes at length to one 'primordial form;' but\r\nhe does not say, so far as I remember, how he supposes this form to\r\nhave been introduced.  He quotes with satisfaction the words of a\r\ncelebrated author and divine who had I gradually learnt to see that it\r\nwas just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe He created a\r\nfew original forms, capable of self-development into other and needful\r\nforms, as to believe He required a fresh act of creation to supply the\r\nvoids caused by the action of His laws.' What Mr. Darwin thinks of\r\nthis view of the introduction of life, I do not know.  But the\r\nanthropomorphism, which it seemed his object to set aside, is as\r\nfirmly associated with the creation of a few forms as with the\r\ncreation of a multitude.  We need clearness and thoroughness here. Two\r\ncourses and two only are possible.  Either let us open our doors\r\nfreely to the conception of creative acts, or abandoning them, let us\r\nradically change our notions of Matter.  If we look at matter as\r\npictured by Democritus, and as defined for generations in our\r\nscientific text-books, the notion of conscious life coming out of it\r\ncannot be formed by the mind.  The argument placed in the mouth of\r\nBishop Butler suffices, in my opinion, to crush all such materialism\r\nas this.  Those, however, who framed these definitions of matter were\r\nbut partial students.  They were not biologists, but mathematicians,\r\nwhose labours referred only to such accidents and properties of matter\r\nas could be expressed in their formulae.  Their science was mechanical\r\nscience, not the science of life.  With matter in its wholeness they\r\nnever dealt; and, denuded by their imperfect definitions, 'the gentle\r\nmother of all' became the object of her children's dread.  Let us\r\nreverently, but honestly, look the question in the face.  Divorced\r\nfrom matter, where is life?  Whatever our faith may say, our knowledge\r\nshows them to be indissolubly joined.  Every meal we eat, and every\r\ncup we drink, illustrates the mysterious control of Mind by Matter.\r\n\r\nOn tracing the line of life backwards, we see it approaching more and\r\nmore to what we call the purely physical condition.  We come at length\r\nto those organisms which I have compared to drops of oil suspended in\r\na mixture of alcohol and water.  We reach the protogenes of Haeckel,\r\nin which we have 'a type distinguishable from a fragment of albumen\r\nonly by its finely granular character.' Can we pause here?  We break a\r\nmagnet, and find two poles in each of its fragments.  We continue the\r\nprocess of breaking; but, however small the parts, each carries with\r\nit, though enfeebled, the polarity of the whole.  And when we can\r\nbreak no longer, we prolong the intellectual vision to the polar\r\nmolecules.  Are we not urged to do something similar in the case of\r\nlife?  Is there not a temptation to close to some extent with\r\nLucretius, when he affirms that 'Nature is seen to do all things\r\nspontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods?  or with\r\nBruno, when he declares that Matter is not 'that mere empty capacity\r\nwhich philosophers have pictured her to be, but the universal mother\r\nwho brings forth all things as the fruit of her own womb?'  Believing,\r\nas I do, in the continuity of nature, I cannot stop abruptly where our\r\nmicroscopes cease to be of use.  Here the vision of the mind\r\nauthoritatively supplements the vision of the eye.  By a necessity\r\nengendered and justified by science I cross the boundary of the\r\nexperimental evidence, [Footnote: This mode of procedure was not\r\ninvented in Belfast.]  and discern in that Matter which we, in our\r\nignorance of its latent powers, and notwithstanding our professed\r\nreverence for its Creator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium, the\r\npromise and potency of all terrestrial Life.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me whether there exists the least evidence to prove that\r\nany form of life can be developed out of matter, without demonstrable\r\nantecedent life, my reply is that evidence considered perfectly\r\nconclusive by many has been adduced; and that were some of us who have\r\npondered this question to follow a very common example, and accept\r\ntestimony because it falls in with our belief, we also should eagerly\r\nclose with the evidence referred to.  But there is in the true man of\r\nscience a desire stronger than the wish to have his beliefs upheld;\r\nnamely, the desire to have them true.  And this stronger wish causes\r\nhim to reject the most plausible support, if he has reason to suspect\r\nthat it is vitiated by error.  Those to whom I refer as having studied\r\nthis question, believing the evidence offered in favour of\r\n'spontaneous generation' to be thus vitiated, cannot accept it.  They\r\nknow full well that the chemist now prepares from inorganic matter a\r\nvast array of substances, which were some time ago regarded as the\r\nsole products of vitality.  They are intimately acquainted with the\r\nstructural power of matter, as evidenced in the phenomena of\r\ncrystallisation.  They can justify scientifically their belief in its\r\npotency, under the proper conditions, to produce organisms.  But, in\r\nreply to your question, they will frankly admit their inability to\r\npoint to any satisfactory experimental proof that life can be\r\ndeveloped, save from demonstrable antecedent life.  As already\r\nindicated, they draw the line from the highest organisms through lower\r\nones down to the lowest; and it is the prolongation of this line by\r\nthe intellect, beyond the range of the senses, that leads them to the\r\nconclusion which Bruno so boldly enunciated. [Footnote: Bruno was a\r\nPantheist,' not an 'Atheist' or a 'Materialist.']\r\n\r\nThe 'materialism' here professed may be vastly different from what you\r\nsuppose, and I therefore crave your gracious patience to the end. 'The\r\nquestion of an external world,' says J. S. Mill, 'is the great\r\nbattleground of metaphysics.' [Footnote: 'Examination of Hamilton,' p.\r\n154.]  Mr. Mill himself reduces external phenomena to 'possibilities\r\nof sensation.' Kant, as we have seen, made time and space 'forms' of\r\nour own intuitions.  Fichte, having first by the inexorable logic of\r\nhis understanding proved himself to be a mere link in that chain of\r\neternal causation which holds so rigidly in nature, violently broke\r\nthe chain by making nature, and all that it inherits, an apparition of\r\nthe mind. [Footnote: 'Bestimmung des Menschen.']  And it is by no\r\nmeans easy to combat such notions.  For when I say 'I see you,' and\r\nthat there is not the least doubt about it, the obvious reply is, that\r\nwhat I am really conscious of is an affection of my own retina.  And\r\nif I urge that my sight can be checked by touching you, the retort\r\nwould be that I am equally transgressing the limits of fact; for what\r\nI am really conscious of is, not that you are there, but that the\r\nnerves of my hand have undergone a change.\r\n\r\nAll we hear, and see, and touch, and taste, and smell, are, it would\r\nbe urged, mere variations of our own condition, beyond which, even to\r\nthe extent of a hair's breadth, we cannot go.  That anything answering\r\nto our impressions exists outside of ourselves is not a fact, but an\r\ninference, to which all validity would be denied by an idealist like\r\nBerkeley, or by a sceptic like Hume.  Mr. Spencer takes another line.\r\nWith him, as with the uneducated man, there is no doubt or question as\r\nto the existence of an external world.  But he differs from the\r\nuneducated, who think that the world really is what consciousness\r\nrepresents it to be.  Our states of consciousness are mere symbols of\r\nan outside entity which produces them and determines the order of\r\ntheir succession, but the real nature of which we can never know.\r\n[Footnote: In a paper, at once popular and profound, entitled 'Recent\r\nProgress in the Theory of Vision,' contained in the volume of lectures\r\nby Helmholtz, published by Longmans, this symbolism of our states of\r\nconsciousness is also dwelt upon.  The impressions of sense are the\r\nmere signs of external things.  In this paper Helmholtz contends\r\nstrongly against the view that the consciousness of space is inborn;\r\nand he evidently doubts the power of the chick to pick up grains of\r\ncorn without preliminary lessons.  On this point, he says, further\r\nexperiments are needed.  Such experiments have been since made by Mr.\r\nSpalding, aided, I believe, in some of his observations by the\r\naccomplished and deeply lamented Lady Amberly; and they seem to prove\r\nconclusively that the chick does not need a single moment's tuition to\r\nenable it to stand, run, govern the muscles of its eyes, and peck.\r\nHelmholtz, however, is contending against the notion of\r\npre-established harmony; and I am not aware of his views as to the\r\norganisation of experiences of race or breed.]  In fact, the whole\r\nprocess of evolution is the manifestation of a Power absolutely\r\ninscrutable to the intellect of man.  As little in our day as in the\r\ndays of Job can man by searching find this Power out.  Considered\r\nfundamentally, then, it is by the operation of an insoluble mystery\r\nthat life on earth is evolved, species differentiated, and mind\r\nunfolded, from their prepotent elements in the immeasurable past.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the doctrine of Evolution consists, not in an\r\nexperimental demonstration (for the subject is hardly accessible to\r\nthis mode of proof), but in its general harmony with scientific\r\nthought.  From contrast, moreover, it derives enormous relative\r\ncogency.  On the one side we have a theory (if it could with any\r\npropriety be so called) derived, as were the theories referred to at\r\nthe beginning of this Address, not from the study of nature, but from\r\nthe observation of men--a theory which converts the Power whose\r\ngarment is seen in the visible universe into an Artificer, fashioned\r\nafter the human model, and acting by broken efforts as man is seen to\r\nact.  On the other side we have the conception that all we see around\r\nus, and all we feel within us--the phenomena; physical nature as well\r\nas those of the human mind--have their unsearchable roots in a\r\ncosmical life, if I dare apply the term, an infinitesimal span of\r\nwhich is offered to the investigation of man.  And even this span is\r\nonly knowable in part.  We can trace the development of a nervous\r\nsystem, and correlate with it the parallel phenomena of sensation and\r\nthought.  We see with undoubting certainty that they go hand in hand.\r\nBut we try to soar in a vacuum the moment we seek to comprehend the\r\nconnection between them.  An Archimedean fulcrum is here required\r\nwhich the human mind cannot command; and the effort to solve the\r\nproblem--to borrow a comparison from an illustrious friend of mine--is\r\nlike that of a man trying to lift himself by his own waistband.  All\r\nthat has been said in this discourse is to be taken in connection with\r\nthis fundamental truth.\r\n\r\nWhen' nascent senses' are spoken of, when 'the differentiation of a\r\ntissue at first vaguely sensitive all over' is spoken of, and when\r\nthese possessions and processes are associated with 'the modification\r\nof an organism by its environment,' the same parallelism, without\r\ncontact, or even approach to contact, is implied.  Man the object is\r\nseparated by an impassable gulf from man the subject.  There is no\r\nmotor energy in the human intellect to carry it, without logical\r\nrupture, from the one to the other.\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of Evolution derives man, in his totality, from the\r\ninteraction of organism and environment through countless ages past.\r\nThe Human Understanding, for example,--that faculty which Mr. Spencer\r\nhas turned so skilfully round upon its own antecedents--is itself a\r\nresult of the play between organism and environment through cosmic\r\nranges of time.  Never, surely, did prescription plead so irresistible\r\na claim.  But then it comes to pass that, over and above his\r\nunderstanding, there are many other things appertaining to man, whose\r\nprescriptive rights are quite as strong as those of the understanding\r\nitself.  It is a result, for example, of the play of organism and\r\nenvironment that sugar is sweet, and that aloes are bitter; that the\r\nsmell of henbane differs' from the perfume of a rose.  Such facts of\r\nconsciousness (for which, by the way, no adequate reason has ever been\r\nrendered) are quite as old as the understanding; and many other things\r\ncan boast an equally ancient origin.  Mr. Spencer at one place refers\r\nto that most powerful of passions--the amatory passion--as one which,\r\nwhen it first occurs, is antecedent to all relative experience\r\nwhatever; and we may press its claim as being at least as ancient, and\r\nas valid, as that of the understanding itself.  Then there are such\r\nthings woven into the texture of man as the feeling of Awe, Reverence,\r\nWonder--and not alone the sexual love just referred to, but the love\r\nof the beautiful, physical, and moral, in Nature, Poetry, and Art.\r\nThere is also that deep-set feeling, which, since the earliest dawn of\r\nhistory, and probably for ages prior to all history, incorporated\r\nitself in the Religious of the world.  You, who have escaped from\r\nthese religions into the high-and-dry light of the intellect, may\r\nderide them; but in so doing you deride accidents of form merely, and\r\nfail to touch the immovable basis of the religious sentiment in the\r\nnature of man.  To yield this sentiment reasonable satisfaction is the\r\nproblem of problems at the present hour.  And grotesque in relation to\r\nscientific culture as many of the religions of the world have been and\r\nare--dangerous, nay, destructive, to the dearest privileges of freemen\r\nas some of them undoubtedly have been, and would, if they could, be\r\nagain--it will be wise to recognise them as the forms of a force,\r\nmischievous if permitted to intrude on the region of objective\r\nknowledge, over which it holds no command, but capable of adding, in\r\nthe region of poetry and emotion, inward completeness and dignity to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nFeeling, I say again, dates from as old an origin and as high a source\r\nas intelligence, and it equally demands its range of play.  The wise\r\nteacher of humanity will recognise the necessity of meeting this\r\ndemand, rather than of resisting it on account of errors and\r\nabsurdities of form.  What we should resist, at all hazards, is the\r\nattempt made in the past, and now repeated, to found upon this\r\nelemental bias of man's nature a system which should exercise despotic\r\nsway over his intellect.  I have no fear of such a consummation.\r\nScience has already to some extent leavened the world; it will leaven\r\nit more and more.  I should look upon the mild light of science\r\nbreaking in upon the minds of the youth of Ireland, and strengthening\r\ngradually to the perfect day, as a surer check to any intellectual or\r\nspiritual tyranny which may threaten this island, than the laws of\r\nprinces or the swords of emperors.  We fought and won our battle even\r\nin the Middle Ages: should we doubt the issue of another conflict with\r\nour broken foe?\r\n\r\nThe impregnable position of science may be described in a few words.\r\nWe claim, and we shall wrest from theology, the entire domain of\r\ncosmological theory.  All schemes and systems which thus infringe upon\r\nthe domain of science must, in so far as they do this, submit to its\r\ncontrol, and relinquish all thought of controlling it.  Acting\r\notherwise proved always disastrous in the past, and it is simply\r\nfatuous to-day.  Every system which would escape the fate of an\r\norganism too rigid to adjust itself to its environment, must be\r\nplastic to the extent that the growth of knowledge demands.  When\r\n'this truth has been thoroughly taken in, rigidity will be relaxed,\r\nexclusiveness diminished, things now deemed essential will be dropped,\r\nand elements now rejected will be assimilated.  The lifting of the\r\nlife is the essential point; and as long as dogmatism, fanaticism, and\r\nintolerance are kept out, various modes of leverage may be employed to\r\nraise life to a higher level.\r\n\r\nScience itself not unfrequently derives motive power from an\r\nultra-scientific source.  Some of its greatest discoveries have been\r\nmade under the stimulus of a non-scientific ideal.  This was the case\r\namong the ancients, and it has been so amongst ourselves.  Mayer,\r\nJoule, and Colding, whose names are associated with the greatest of\r\nmodern generalisations, were thus influenced.  With his usual insight,\r\nLange at one place remarks, that 'it is not always the objectively\r\ncorrect and intelligible that helps man most, or leads most quickly to\r\nthe fullest and truest knowledge.  As the sliding body upon the\r\nbrachystochrone reaches its end sooner than by the straighter road of\r\nthe inclined plane, so, through the swing of the ideal, we often\r\narrive at the naked truth more rapidly than by the processes of the\r\nunderstanding.' Whewell speaks of enthusiasm of temper as a hindrance\r\nto science; but he means the enthusiasm of weak heads.  There is a\r\nstrong and resolute enthusiasm in which science finds an ally; and it\r\nis to the lowering of this fire, rather than to the diminution of\r\nintellectual insight, that the lessening productiveness of men of\r\nscience, in their mature years, is to be ascribed.  Mr. Buckle sought\r\nto detach intellectual achievement from moral force.  He gravely\r\nerred; for without moral force to whip it into action, the achievement\r\nof the intellect would be poor indeed.\r\n\r\nIt has been said by its opponents that science divorces itself from\r\nliterature; but the statement, like so many others, arises from lack\r\nof knowledge.  A glance at the less technical writings of its\r\nleaders--of its Helmholtz, its Huxley, and its Du Bois-Reymond--would\r\nshow what breadth of literary culture they command.  Where among\r\nmodern writers can you find their superiors in clearness and vigour of\r\nliterary style?  Science desires not isolation, but freely combines\r\nwith every effort towards the bettering of man's estate.\r\nSingle-handed, and supported, not by outward sympathy, but by inward\r\nforce, it has built at least one great wing of the many-mansioned home\r\nwhich man in his totality demands.  And if rough walls and protruding\r\nrafter-ends indicate that on one side the edifice is still incomplete,\r\nit is only by wise combination of the parts required, with those\r\nalready irrevocably built, that we can hope for completeness.  There\r\nis no necessary incongruity between what has been accomplished and\r\nwhat remains to be done.  The moral glow of Socrates, which we all\r\nfeel by ignition, has in it nothing incompatible with the physics of\r\nAnaxagoras which he so much scorned, but which he would hardly scorn\r\nto-day.  And here I am reminded of one among us, hoary, but still\r\nstrong, whose prophet-voice some thirty years ago, far more than any\r\nother of this age, unlocked whatever of life and nobleness lay latent\r\nin its most gifted minds--one fit to stand beside Socrates or the\r\nMaccabean Eleazar, and to dare and suffer all that they suffered and\r\ndared--fit, as he once said of Fichte, Ito have been the teacher of\r\nthe Stoa, and to have discoursed of Beauty and Virtue in the groves of\r\nAcademe.' With a capacity to grasp physical principles which his\r\nfriend Goethe did not possess, and which even total lack of exercise\r\nhas not been able to reduce to atrophy, it is the world's loss that\r\nhe, in the vigour of his years, did not open his mind and sympathies\r\nto science, and make its conclusions a portion of his message to\r\nmankind.  Marvellously endowed as he was--equally equipped on the side\r\nof the Heart and of the Understanding--he might have done much towards\r\nteaching us how to reconcile the claims of both, and to enable them in\r\ncoming times to dwell together, in unity of spirit and in the bond of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAnd now the end is come.  With more time, or greater strength and\r\nknowledge, what has been here said might have been better said, while\r\nworthy matters, here omitted, might have received fit expression.  But\r\nthere would have been no material deviation from the views set forth.\r\nAs regards myself, they are not the growth of a day; and as regards\r\nyou, I thought you ought to know the environment which, with or\r\nwithout your consent, is rapidly surrounding you, and in relation to\r\nwhich some adjustment on your part may be necessary.  A hint of\r\nHamlet's, however, teaches us how the troubles of common life may be\r\nended; and it is perfectly possible for you and me to purchase\r\nintellectual peace at the price of intellectual death.  The world is\r\nnot without refuges of this description; nor is it wanting in persons\r\nwho seek their shelter, and try to persuade others to do the same. The\r\nunstable and the weak have yielded and will yield to this persuasion,\r\nand they to whom repose is sweeter than the truth.  But I would exhort\r\nyou to refuse the offered shelter, and to scorn the base repose--to\r\naccept, if the choice be forced upon you, commotion before stagnation,\r\nthe breezy leap of the torrent before the foetid stillness of the\r\nswamp.  In the course of this Address I have touched on debatable\r\nquestions, and led you over what will be deemed dangerous ground--and\r\nthis partly with the view of telling you that, as regards these\r\nquestions, science claims unrestricted right of search.  It is not to\r\nthe point to say that the views of Lucretius and Bruno, of Darwin and\r\nSpencer, may be wrong.  Here I should agree with you, deeming it\r\nindeed certain that these views will undergo modification. But the\r\npoint is, that, whether right or wrong, we claim the right to discuss\r\nthem.  For science, however, no exclusive claim is here made; you are\r\nnot urged to erect it into an idol.  The inexorable advance of man's\r\nunderstanding in the path of knowledge, and those unquenchable claims\r\nof his moral and emotional nature, which the understanding can never\r\nsatisfy, are here equally set forth.  The world embraces not only a\r\nNewton, but a Shakspeare--not only a Boyle, but a Raphael--not only a\r\nKant, but a Beethoven--not only a Darwin, but a Carlyle.  Not in each\r\nof these, but in all, is human nature whole. They are not opposed, but\r\nsupplementary--not mutually exclusive, but reconcilable.\r\n\r\nAnd if, unsatisfied with them all, the human mind, with the yearning\r\nof a pilgrim for his distant home, will still turn to the Mystery from\r\nwhich it has emerged, seeking so to fashion it as to give unity to\r\nthought and faith; so long as this is done, not only without\r\nintolerance or bigotry of any kind, but with the enlightened\r\nrecognition that ultimate fixity of conception is here unattainable,\r\nand that each succeeding age must be held free to fashion the mystery\r\nin accordance with its own needs--then, casting aside all the\r\nrestrictions of Materialism, I would affirm this to be a field for the\r\nnoblest exercise of what, in contrast with the knowing faculties, may\r\nbe called the creative faculties of man.  Here, however, I touch a\r\ntheme too great for me to handle, but which will assuredly be handled\r\nby the loftiest minds, when you and I, like streaks of morning cloud,\r\nshall have melted into the infinite azure of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nX.  APOLOGY FOR THE BELFAST ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nTHE world has been frequently informed of late that I have raised up\r\nagainst myself a host of enemies; and considering, with few\r\nexceptions, the deliverances of the Press, and more particularly of\r\nthe religious Press, I am forced to admit that the statement is only\r\ntoo true.  I derive some comfort, nevertheless, from the reflection of\r\nDiogenes, transmitted to us by Plutarch, that 'he who would be saved\r\nmust have good friends or violent enemies; and that he is best off who\r\npossesses both.' This 'best' condition, I have reason to believe, is\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nReflecting on the fraction I have read of recent remonstrances,\r\nappeals, menaces, and judgments--covering not only the world that now\r\nis, but that which is to come--I have noticed with mournful interest\r\nhow trivially men seem to be influenced by what they call their\r\nreligion, and how potently by that 'nature' which it is the alleged\r\nprovince of religion to eradicate or subdue.  From fair and manly\r\nargument, from the tenderest and holiest sympathy on the part of those\r\nwho desire my eternal good, I pass by many gradations, through\r\ndeliberate unfairness, to a spirit of bitterness, which desires with a\r\nfervour inexpressible in words my eternal ill.  Now, were religion the\r\npotent factor, we might expect a homogeneous utterance from those\r\nprofessing a common creed, while, if human nature be the really potent\r\nfactor, we may expect utterances as heterogeneous as the characters of\r\nmen.  As a matter of fact we have the latter; suggesting to my mind\r\nthat the common religion, professed and defended by these different\r\npeople, is merely the accidental conduit through which they pour their\r\nown tempers, lofty or low, courteous or vulgar, mild or ferocious, as\r\nthe case may be.  Pure abuse, however, as serving no good end, I have,\r\nwherever possible, deliberately avoided reading, wishing, indeed, to\r\nkeep, not only hatred, malice, and uncharitableness, but even every\r\ntrace of irritation, far away from my side of a discussion which\r\ndemands not only good-temper, but largeness, clearness, and\r\nmany-sidedness of mind, if it is to guide us to even provisional\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, with many variations of note and comment, that in\r\nthe Address as subsequently published by Messrs. Longman I have\r\nretracted opinions uttered at Belfast. A Roman Catholic writer is\r\nspecially strong upon this point.  Startled by the deep chorus of\r\ndissent which my 'dazzling fallacies' have evoked, I am now trying to\r\nretreat.  This he will by no means tolerate.  'It is too late now to\r\nseek to hide from the eyes of mankind one foul blot, one ghastly\r\ndeformity.  Professor Tyndall has himself told us how and where this\r\nAddress of his was composed.  It was written among the glaciers and\r\nthe solitudes of the Swiss mountains.  It was no hasty, hurried, crude\r\nproduction; its every sentence bore marks of thought and care.\r\n\r\nMy critic intends to be severe: he is simply just. In the 'solitudes'\r\nto which he refers I worked with deliberation, endeavouring even to\r\npurify my intellect by disciplines similar to those enjoined by his\r\nown Church for the sanctification of the soul.  I tried, moreover, in\r\nmy ponderings to realise not only the lawful, but the expedient; and\r\nto permit no fear to act upon my mind, save that of uttering a single\r\nword on which I could not take my stand, either in this or in any\r\nother world.\r\n\r\nStill my time was so brief, the difficulties arising from my isolated\r\nposition were so numerous, and my thought and expression so slow,\r\nthat, in a literary point of view, I halted, not only behind the\r\nideal, but behind the possible.  Hence, after the delivery of the\r\nAddress, I went over it with the desire, not to revoke its principles,\r\nbut to improve it verbally, and above all to remove any word which\r\nmight give colour to the notion of 'crudeness, hurry, or haste.'\r\n\r\nIn connection with the charge of Atheism my critic refers to the\r\nPreface to the second issue of the Belfast Address: 'Christian men,' I\r\nthere say, 'are proved by their writings to have their hours of\r\nweakness and of doubt, as well as their hours of strength and of\r\nconviction; and men like myself share, in their own way, these\r\nvariations of mood and tense.  Were the religious moods of many of my\r\nassailants the only alternative ones, I do not know how strong the\r\nclaims of the doctrine of \"Material Atheism\" upon my allegiance might\r\nbe.  Probably they would be very strong.  But, as it is, I have\r\nnoticed during years of self-observation that it is not in hours of\r\nclearness and vigour that this doctrine commends itself to my mind;\r\nthat in the presence of stronger and healthier thought it ever\r\ndissolves and disappears, as offering no solution of the mystery in\r\nwhich we dwell, and of which we form a part.'\r\n\r\nWith reference to this honest and reasonable utterance my censor\r\nexclaims, 'This is a most remarkable passage.  Much as we dislike\r\nseasoning polemics with strong words, we assert that this Apology only\r\ntends to affix with links of steel to the name of Professor Tyndall,\r\nthe dread imputation against which be struggles.'\r\n\r\nHere we have a very fair example of subjective religious vigour.  But\r\nmy quarrel with such exhibitions is that they do not always represent\r\nobjective fact.  No atheistic reasoning can, I hold, dislodge religion\r\nfrom the human heart.  Logic cannot deprive us of life, and religion\r\nis life to the religious.  As an experience of consciousness it is\r\nbeyond the assaults of logic.  But the religious life is often\r\nprojected in external forms--I use the word in its widest sense--and\r\nthis embodiment of the religious sentiment will have to bear more and\r\nmore, as the world become more enlightened, the stress of scientific\r\ntests.  We must be careful of projecting into external nature that\r\nwhich belongs to ourselves.  My critic commits this mistake: he feels,\r\nand takes delight in feeling, that I am struggling, and he obviously\r\nexperiences the most exquisite pleasures of 'the muscular sense' in\r\nholding me down.  His feelings are as real, as if his imagination of\r\nwhat mine are were equally real.  His picture of my 'struggles' is,\r\nhowever, a mere delusion.  I do not struggle.  I do not fear the\r\ncharge of Atheism; nor should I even disavow it, in reference to any\r\ndefinition of the Supreme which he, or his order, would be likely to\r\nframe.  His 'links' and his 'steel' and his 'dread imputations' are,\r\ntherefore, even more unsubstantial than my 'streaks of morning\r\ncloud,' and they may be permitted to vanish together.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThese minor and more purely personal matters at an end, the weightier\r\nallegation remains, that at Belfast I misused my position by quitting\r\nthe domain of science, and making an unjustifiable raid into the\r\ndomain of theology.  This I fail to see.  Laying aside abuse, I hope\r\nmy accusers will consent to reason with me.  Is it not lawful for a\r\nscientific man to speculate on the antecedents of the solar system?\r\nDid Kant, Laplace, and William Herschel quit their legitimate spheres,\r\nwhen they prolonged the intellectual vision beyond the boundary of\r\nexperience, and propounded the nebular theory?  Accepting that theory\r\nas probable, is it not permitted to a scientific man to follow up, in\r\nidea, the series of changes associated with the condensation of the\r\nnebulae; to picture the successive detachment of planets and moons,\r\nand the relation of all of them to the sun?  If I look upon our earth,\r\nwith its orbital revolution and axial rotation, as one small issue of\r\nthe process which made the solar system what it is, will any\r\ntheologian deny my right to entertain and express this theoretic view?\r\nTime was when a multitude of theologians would have been found to do\r\nso--when that archenemy of science which now vaunts its tolerance\r\nwould have made a speedy end of the man who might venture to publish\r\nany opinion of the kind.  But, that time, unless the world is caught\r\nstrangely slumbering, is for ever past.\r\n\r\nAs regards inorganic nature, then, we may traverse, without let or\r\nhindrance, the whole distance which separates the nebulae from the\r\nworlds of to-day.  But only a few years ago this now conceded ground\r\nof science was theological ground.  I could by no means regard this as\r\nthe final and sufficient concession of theology; and, at Belfast, I\r\nthought it not only my right but my duty to state that, as regards the\r\norganic world, we must enjoy the freedom which we have already won in\r\nregard to the inorganic.  I could not discern the shred of a\r\ntitle-deed which gave any man, or any class of men, the right to open\r\nthe door of one of these worlds to the scientific searcher, and to\r\nclose the other against him.  And I considered it frankest, wisest,\r\nand in the long run most conducive to permanent peace, to indicate,\r\nwithout evasion or reserve, the ground that belongs to Science, and to\r\nwhich she will assuredly make good her claim.\r\n\r\nI have been reminded that an eminent predecessor of mine in the\r\nPresidential chair, expressed a totally different view of the Cause of\r\nthings from that enunciated by me.  In doing so he transgressed the\r\nbounds of science at least as much as I did; but nobody raised an\r\noutcry against him.  The freedom he took I claim.  And looking at what\r\nI must regard as the extravagances of the religious world; at the very\r\ninadequate and foolish notions concerning this universe which are\r\nentertained by the majority of our authorised religious teachers; at\r\nthe waste of energy on the part of good men over things unworthy, if I\r\nmay say it without discourtesy, of the attention of enlightened\r\nheathens; the fight about the fripperies of Ritualism, and the verbal\r\nquibbles of the Athanasian Creed; the forcing on the public view of\r\nPontigny Pilgrimages; the dating of historic epochs from the\r\ndefinition of the Immaculate Conception; the proclamation of the\r\nDivine Glories of the Sacred Heart--standing in the midst of these\r\nchimeras, which astound all thinking men, it did not appear to me\r\nextravagant to claim the public tolerance for an hour and a half, for\r\nthe statement of more reasonable views--views more in accordance with\r\nthe verities which science has brought to light, and which many weary\r\nsouls would, I thought, welcome with gratification and relief.\r\n\r\nBut to come to closer quarters.  The expression to which the most\r\nviolent exception has been taken is this: 'Abandoning all disguise,\r\nthe confession I feel bound to make before you is, that I prolong the\r\nvision backward across the boundary of the experimental evidence, and\r\ndiscern in that Matter which we, in our ignorance, and notwithstanding\r\nour professed reverence for its Creator, have hitherto covered with\r\nopprobrium, the promise and potency of every form and quality of\r\nlife.' To call it a 'chorus of dissent,' as my Catholic critic does,\r\nis a mild way of describing the storm of opprobrium with which this\r\nstatement has been assailed.  But the first blast of passion being\r\npast, I hope I may again ask my opponents to consent to reason.  First\r\nof all, I am blamed for crossing the boundary of the experimental\r\nevidence.  This, I reply, is the habitual action of the scientific\r\nmind--at least of that portion of it which applies itself to physical\r\ninvestigation.  Our theories of light, heat, magnetism, and\r\nelectricity, all imply the crossing of this boundary.  My paper on the\r\n'Scientific Use of the Imagination,' and my 'Lectures on Light,'\r\nillustrate this point in the amplest manner; and in the Article\r\nentitled 'Matter and Force' in the present volume I have sought,\r\nincidentally, to make clear, that in physics the experiential\r\nincessantly leads to the ultra-experiential; that out of experience\r\nthere always grows something finer than mere experience, and that in\r\ntheir different powers of ideal extension consists, for the most part,\r\nthe difference between the great and the mediocre investigator.  The\r\nkingdom of science, then, cometh not by observation and experiment\r\nalone, but is completed by fixing the roots of observation and\r\nexperiment in a region inaccessible to both, and in dealing with which\r\nwe are forced to fall back upon the picturing power of the mind.\r\n\r\nPassing the boundary of experience, therefore, does not, in the\r\nabstract, constitute a sufficient ground for censure.  There must have\r\nbeen something in my particular mode of crossing it which provoked\r\nthis tremendous 'chorus of dissent.'\r\n\r\nLet us calmly reason the point out.  I hold the nebular theory as it\r\nwas held by Kant, Laplace, and William Herschel, and as it is held by\r\nthe best scientific intellects of to-day.  According to it, our sun\r\nand planets were once diffused through space as an impalpable haze,\r\nout of which, by condensation, came the solar system.  What caused the\r\nhaze to condense?  Loss of heat.  What rounded the sun and planets?\r\nThat which rounds a tear--molecular force.  For aeons, the immensity\r\nof which overwhelms man's conceptions, the earth was unfit to maintain\r\nwhat we call life.  It is now covered with visible living things. They\r\nare not formed of matter different from that of the earth around them.\r\nThey are, on the contrary, bone of its bone, and flesh of its flesh.\r\nHow were they introduced?  Was life implicated in the nebula--as part,\r\nit may be, of a vaster and wholly Unfathomable Life; or is it the work\r\nof a Being standing outside the nebula, who fashioned it, and\r\nvitalised it; but whose own origin and ways are equally past finding\r\nout?  As far as the eye of science has hitherto ranged through nature,\r\nno intrusion of purely creative power into any series of phenomena has\r\never been observed.  The assumption of such a power to account for\r\nspecial phenomena, though often made, has always proved a failure.  It\r\nis opposed to the very spirit of science; and I therefore assumed the\r\nresponsibility of holding up, in contrast with it, that method of\r\nnature which it has been the vocation and triumph of science to\r\ndisclose, and in the application of which we can alone hope for\r\nfurther light.  Holding, then, 'that the nebulae and the solar system,\r\nlife included, stand to each other in the relation of the germ to the\r\nfinished organism, I reaffirm here, not arrogantly, or defiantly, but\r\nwithout a shade of indistinctness, the position laid down at Belfast.\r\n\r\nNot with the vagueness belonging to the emotions, but with the\r\ndefiniteness belonging to the understanding, the scientific man has to\r\nput to himself these questions regarding the introduction of life upon\r\nthe earth.  He will be the last to dogmatise upon the subject, for he\r\nknows best that certainty is here for the present unattainable.  His\r\nrefusal of the creative hypothesis is less an assertion of knowledge\r\nthan a protest against the assumption of knowledge which must long, if\r\nnot for ever, lie beyond us, and the claim to which is the source of\r\nperpetual confusion upon earth.  With a mind open to conviction he\r\nasks his opponents to show him an authority for the belief they so\r\nstrenuously and so fiercely uphold.  They can do no more than point to\r\nthe Book of Genesis, or some other portion of the Bible.  Profoundly\r\ninteresting, and indeed pathetic, to me are those attempts of the\r\nopening mind of man to appease its hunger for a Cause.  But the Book\r\nof Genesis has no voice in scientific questions.  To the grasp of\r\ngeology, which it resisted for a time, it at length yielded like\r\npotter's clay; its authority as a system of cosmogony being\r\ndiscredited on all hands, by the abandonment of the obvious meaning of\r\nits writer.  It is a poem, not a scientific treatise.  In the former\r\naspect it is for ever beautiful: in the latter aspect it has been, and\r\nit will continue to be, purely obstructive and hurtful.  To knowledge\r\nits value has been negative, leading, in rougher ages than ours, to\r\nphysical, and even in our own' free' age to moral, violence.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nNo incident connected with the proceedings at Belfast is more\r\ninstructive than the deportment of the Catholic hierarchy of Ireland;\r\na body usually too wise to confer notoriety upon an adversary by\r\nimprudently denouncing him.  The 'Times,' to which I owe a great deal\r\non the score of fair play, where so much has been unfair, thinks that\r\nthe Irish Cardinal, Archbishops, and Bishops, in a recent manifesto,\r\nadroitly employed a weapon which I, at an unlucky moment, placed in\r\ntheir hands.  The antecedents of their action cause me to regard it in\r\na different light; and a brief reference to these antecedents will, I\r\nthink, illuminate not only their proceedings regarding Belfast, but\r\nother doings which have been recently noised abroad.\r\n\r\nBefore me lies a document bearing the date of November 1873, which,\r\nafter appearing for a moment, unaccountably vanished from public view.\r\nIt is a Memorial addressed, by Seventy of the Students and Ex-students\r\nof the Catholic University in Ireland, to the Episcopal Board of the\r\nUniversity; and it constitutes the plainest and bravest remonstrance\r\never addressed by Irish laymen to their spiritual pastors and masters.\r\nIt expresses the profoundest dissatisfaction with the curriculum\r\nmarked out for the students of the University; setting forth the\r\nextraordinary fact that the lecture-list for the faculty of Science,\r\npublished a month before they wrote, did not contain the name of a\r\nsingle Professor of the Physical or Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe memorialists forcibly deprecate this, and dwell upon the necessity\r\nof education in science: 'The distinguishing mark of this age is its\r\nardour for science.  The natural sciences have, within the last fifty\r\nyears, become the chiefest study in the world; they are in our time\r\npursued with an activity unparalleled in the history of mankind.\r\nScarce a year now passes without some discovery being made in these\r\nsciences which, as with the touch of the magician's wand, shivers to\r\natoms theories formerly deemed unassailable.  It is through the\r\nphysical and natural sciences that the fiercest assaults are now made\r\non our religion.  No more deadly weapon is used against our faith than\r\nthe facts incontestably proved by modern researches in science.'\r\n\r\nSuch statements must be the reverse of comfortable to a number of\r\ngentlemen who, trained in the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, have been\r\naccustomed to the unquestioning submission of all other sciences to\r\ntheir divine science of Theology.  But this is not all:\r\n\r\nOne thing seems certain,' say the memorialists, viz, that if chairs\r\nfor the physical and natural sciences be not soon founded in the\r\nCatholic University, very many young men will have their faith exposed\r\nto dangers which the creation of a school of science in the University\r\nwould defend them from.  For our generation of Irish Catholics are\r\nwrithing under the sense of their inferiority in science, and are\r\ndetermined that such inferiority shall not long continue; and so, if\r\nscientific training be unattainable at our University, they will seek\r\nit at Trinity or at the Queen's Colleges, in not one of which is there\r\na Catholic Professor of Science.'\r\n\r\nThose who imagined the Catholic University at Kensington to be due to\r\nthe spontaneous recognition, on the part of the Roman hierarchy, of\r\nthe intellectual needs of the age, will derive enlightenment from\r\nthis, and still more from what follows: for the most formidable threat\r\nremains.  To the picture of Catholic students seceding to Trinity and\r\nthe Queen's Colleges, the memorialists add this darkest stroke of all:\r\n'They will, in the solitude of their own homes, unaided by any guiding\r\nadvice, devour the works of Haeckel, Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, and\r\nLyell; works innocuous if studied under a professor who would point\r\nout the difference between established facts and erroneous inferences,\r\nbut which are calculated to sap the faith of a solitary student,\r\ndeprived of a discriminating judgment to which he could refer for a\r\nsolution of his difficulties.'\r\n\r\nIn the light of the knowledge given by this courageous memorial, and\r\nof similar knowledge otherwise derived, the recent Catholic manifesto\r\ndid not at all strike me as a chuckle over the mistake of a maladroit\r\nadversary, but rather as an evidence of profound uneasiness on the\r\npart of the Cardinal, the Archbishops, and the Bishops who signed it.\r\nThey acted towards the Students' Memorial, however, with their\r\naccustomed practical wisdom.  As one concession to the spirit which it\r\nembodied, the Catholic University at Kensington was brought forth,\r\napparently as the effect of spontaneous inward force, and not of\r\noutward pressure becoming too formidable to be successfully opposed.\r\n\r\nThe memorialists point with bitterness to the fact, that 'the name of\r\nno Irish Catholic is known in connection with the physical and natural\r\nsciences.' But this, they ought to know, is the complaint of free and\r\ncultivated minds wherever a Priesthood exercises dominant power.\r\nPrecisely the same complaint has been made with respect to the\r\nCatholics of Germany.  The great national literature and the\r\nscientific achievements of that country, in modern times, are almost\r\nwholly the work of Protestants.  A vanishingly small fraction of it\r\nonly is derived from members of the Roman Church, although the number\r\nof these in Germany is at least as great as that of the Protestants.\r\n'The question arises,' says a writer in an able German periodical,\r\n'what is the cause of a phenomenon so humiliating to the Catholics? It\r\ncannot be referred to want of natural endowment due to climate (for\r\nthe Protestants of Southern Germany have contributed powerfully to the\r\ncreations of the German intellect), but purely to outward\r\ncircumstances.  And these are readily discovered in the pressure\r\nexercised for centuries by the Jesuitical system, which has crushed\r\nout of Catholics every tendency to free mental productiveness.' It is,\r\nindeed, in Catholic countries that the weight of Ultramontanism has\r\nbeen most severely felt.  It is in such countries that the very finest\r\nspirits, who have dared, without quitting their faith, to plead for\r\nfreedom or reform, have suffered extinction.  The extinction, however,\r\nwas more apparent than real, and Hermes, Hirscher, and Gunther, though\r\nindividually broken and subdued, prepared the way, in Bavaria, for the\r\npersecuted but unflinching Frohschammer, for Doellinger, and for the\r\nremarkable liberal movement of which Doellinger is the head and guide.\r\n\r\nThough moulded for centuries to an obedience unparalleled in any other\r\ncountry, except Spain, the Irish intellect is beginning to show signs\r\nof independence; demanding a diet more suited to its years than the\r\npabulum of the Middle Ages.  As for the recent manifesto in which\r\nPope, Cardinal, Archbishops, and Bishops are united in one grand\r\nanathema, its character and fate are shadowed forth by the Vision of\r\nNebuchadnezzar recorded in the Book of Daniel.  It resembles the\r\nimage, whose form was terrible, but the gold, and silver, and brass,\r\nand iron of which rested upon feet of clay.  And a stone smote the\r\nfeet of clay; and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the\r\ngold, were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the\r\nsummer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Capel has recently been good enough to proclaim at once the\r\nfriendliness of his Church towards true science, and her right to\r\ndetermine what true science is.  Let us dwell for a moment on the\r\nproofs of her scientific competence.  When Halley's comet appeared in\r\n1456 it was regarded as the harbinger of God's vengeance, the\r\ndispenser of war, pestilence, and famine, and by order of the Pope the\r\nchurch bells of Europe were rung to scare the monster away.  An\r\nadditional daily prayer was added to the supplications of the\r\nfaithful.  The comet in due time disappeared, and the faithful were\r\ncomforted by the assurance that, as in previous instances relating to\r\neclipses, droughts, and rains, so also as regards this 'nefarious'\r\ncomet, victory had been vouchsafed to the Church.\r\n\r\nBoth Pythagoras and Copernicus had taught the heliocentric\r\ndoctrine--that the earth revolves round the sun.  In the exercise of\r\nher right to determine what true science is, the Church, in the\r\nPontificate of Paul V, stepped in, and by the mouth of the holy\r\nCongregation of the Index, delivered, on March 5, 1616, the following\r\ndecree:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it hath also come to the knowledge of the said holy\r\ncongregation that the false Pythagorean doctrine of the mobility of\r\nthe earth and the immobility of the sun, entirely opposed to Holy\r\nwrit, which is taught by Nicolas Copernicus, is now published abroad\r\nand received by many.  In order that this opinion may not further\r\nspread, to the damage of Catholic truth, it is ordered that this and\r\nall other books teaching the like doctrine be suspended, and by this\r\ndecree they are all respectively suspended, forbidden, and condemned.\r\n\r\nBut why go back to 1456 and 1616?  Far be it from me to charge bygone\r\nsins upon Monsignor Capel, were it not for the practices he upholds\r\nto-day.  The most applauded dogmatist and champion of the Jesuits is,\r\nI am informed, Perrone.  No less than thirty editions of a work of his\r\nhave been scattered abroad for the healing of the nations.  His\r\nnotions of physical astronomy are virtually those of 1456.  He teaches\r\nboldly that 'God does not rule by universal law... that when God\r\norders a given planet to stand still He does not detract from any law\r\npassed by Himself, but orders that planet to move round the sun for\r\nsuch and such a time, then to stand still, and then again to move, as\r\nHis pleasure may be.' Jesuitism proscribed Frohschammer for\r\nquestioning its favourite dogma, that every human soul was created by\r\na direct supernatural act of God, and for asserting that man, body and\r\nsoul, came from his parents.  This is the system that now strives for\r\nuniversal power; it is from it, as Monsignor Capel graciously informs\r\nus, that we are to learn what is allowable in science, and what is\r\nnot!\r\n\r\nIn the face of such facts, which might be multiplied at will, it\r\nrequires extraordinary bravery of mind, or a reliance upon public\r\nignorance almost as extraordinary, to make the claims made by\r\nMonsignor Capel for his Church.\r\n\r\nBefore me is a very remarkable letter addressed in 1875 by the\r\nBishop of Montpellier to the Deans and Professors of Faculties of\r\nMontpellier, in which the writer very clearly lays down the claims of\r\nhis Church.  He had been startled by an incident occurring in a course\r\nof lectures on Physiology given by a professor, of whose scientific\r\ncapacity there was no doubt, but who, it was alleged, rightly or\r\nwrongly, had made his course the vehicle of materialism.  'Je ne me\r\nsuis point donne,' says the Bishop, 'la mission que je remplis au\r\nmilieu de vous.  \"Personne, au temoignage de saint Paul, ne s'attribue\r\nà soi-même un pareil honneur; il y faut être appelé de Dieu, comme\r\nAaron.\" Et pourquoi en est-il ainsi?  C'est parse que, selon le même\r\nApôtre, noun devons titre les ambassadeurs de Dieu; et it n'est pas\r\ndans les usages, pas plus qu'il n'est dans la raison et le droit,\r\nqu'un envoyé s'accrédite lui-même.  Mais, si j'ai recu d'En-Haut une\r\nmission; si l'Eglise, au nom de Dieu lui-même, a souscrit me lettres\r\nde créance, me siéraitil de manquer aux instructions qu'elle m'a\r\ndonnées et d'entendre, en un sens différent du sien, le rôle qu'elle\r\nm'a confié?\r\n\r\n'Or, Messieurs, la sainte Eglise se croit investie du droit absolu\r\nd'enseigner les hommes; elle se croit dépositaire de la vérité, non\r\npas de la vérité fragmentaire, incomplète, mêlée de certitude et\r\nd'hésitation, mais de la vérité totale, complète, au point de vue\r\nreligieux.  Bien plus, elle est si sûre de l'infaillibilité que son\r\nFondateur divin lui a communiquée, comme la dot magnifique de leur\r\nindissoluble alliance, que, même dans l'ordre naturel, scientifique ou\r\nphilosophique, moral ou politique, elle n'admet pas qu'un système\r\npuisse être soutenu et adopté par des chrétiens, s'il contredit à des\r\ndogmes définis.  Elle considère que la négation volontaire et\r\nopiniâtre d'un seul point de sa doctrine rend coupable du péché\r\nd'hérésie; et elle pense que toute hérésie formelle, si on ne la\r\nrejette pas courageusement avant de paraitre devant Dieu, entraine\r\navec soi la perte certaine de la grâce et de l'éternité.'\r\n\r\nThe Bishop recalls those whom he addresses from the false philosophy\r\nof the present to the philosophy of the past, and foresees the triumph\r\nof the latter.  'Avant que le dix-neuvième siècle s'achève, la vieille\r\nphilosophie scolastique aura repris sa place dans la juste admiration\r\ndu monde.  Il lui faudra pourtant bien du temps pour guérir les maux\r\nde tout genre, causés par son indigne rivale; et pendant de longues\r\nannées encore, ce nom de philosophie, le plus grand de la langue\r\nhumaine après celui de religion, sera suspect aux âmes qui se\r\nsouviendront de la science impie et materialiste de Locke, de\r\nCondillac ou d'Helvétius.  L'heure actuelle est aux sciences\r\nnaturelles: c'est maintenant l'instrument de combat contre l'Eglise et\r\ncontre toute foi religieuse.  Nous ne les redoutons pas.'  Further on\r\nthe Bishop warns his readers that everything can be abused.  Poetry is\r\ngood, but in excess it may injure practical conduct.  'Les\r\nmathématiques sont excellentes: et Bossuet les a louées \"comme étant\r\nce qui sert le plus à la justesse du raisonnement;\" mais si on\r\ns'accoutume exclusivement à leur méthode, rien de ce qui appartient à\r\nl'ordre moral ne parait plus pouvoir être démontré; et Fénelon a pu\r\nparler de l'ensorcellement et des attraits diaboliqes de la\r\ngeometrie.'\r\n\r\nThe learned Bishop thus finally accentuates the claims of the Church:\r\n'Comme le définissait le Pape Léon X, au cinquième concile oecuménique\r\nde Latran, \"Le vrai ne peut pas être contraire à lui-même: par\r\nconséquent, toute assertion contraire à une vérité de foi révélée est\r\nnécessairement et absolument fausse.\" Il suit de là que, sans entrer\r\ndans l'examen scientifique de telle ou telle question de physiologie,\r\nmais par la seule certitude de nos dogmes, nous pouvons juger du sort\r\nde telle ou telle hypothèse, qui est une machine de guerre\r\nanti-chrétienne plutôt qu'une conquête sérieuse sur les secrets et les\r\nmystères de la nature... C'est un dogme que l'homme a été formé et\r\nfaconné des mains de Dieu.  Donc il est faux, hérétique, contraire à\r\nla dignité du Créateur et offensant pour son chef-d'oeuvre, de dire\r\nque l'homme constitue la septième espèce des singes...  Hérésie encore\r\nde dire que le genre humain n'est pas sorti d'un seul couple, et qu'on\r\ny peut compter jusqu'à douze races distinctes!'\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe course of life upon earth, as far as Science can see, has been one\r\nof amelioration--a steady advance on the whole from the lower to the\r\nhigher.  The continued effort of animated nature is to improve its\r\ncondition and raise itself to a loftier level.  In man improvement and\r\namelioration depend largely upon the growth of conscious knowledge, by\r\nwhich the errors of ignorance are continually moulted, and truth is\r\norganised.  It is the advance of knowledge that has given a\r\nmaterialistic colour to the philosophy of this age.  Materialism is\r\ntherefore not a thing to be mourned over, but to be honestly\r\nconsidered--accepted if it be wholly true, rejected if it be wholly\r\nfalse, wisely sifted and turned to account if it embrace a mixture of\r\ntruth and error.  Of late years the study of the nervous system, and\r\nits relation to thought and feeling, have profoundly occupied\r\nenquiring minds.  It is our duty not to shirk--it ought rather to be\r\nour privilege to accept--the established results of such enquiries,\r\nfor here assuredly our ultimate weal depends upon our loyalty to the\r\ntruth.  Instructed as to the control which the nervous system\r\nexercises over man's moral and intellectual nature, we shall be better\r\nprepared, not only to mend their manifold defects, but also to\r\nstrengthen and purify both.  Is mind degraded by this recognition of\r\nits dependence?  Assuredly not.  Matter, on the contrary, is raised to\r\nthe level it ought to occupy, and from which timid ignorance would\r\nremove it.\r\n\r\nBut the light is dawning, and it will become stronger as time goes on.\r\nEven the Brighton \"Church Congress\" affords evidence of this.  From\r\nthe manifold confusions of that assemblage my memory has rescued two\r\nitems, which it would fain preserve: the recognition of a relation\r\nbetween Health and Religion, and the address of the Rev. Harry Jones.\r\nOut of the conflict of vanities his words emerge wholesome and strong,\r\nbecause undrugged by dogma, coming directly from the warm brain of one\r\nwho knows what practical truth means, and who has faith in its\r\nvitality and inherent power of propagation.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether he is less effectual in his ministry than his more\r\nembroidered colleagues?  It surely behoves our teachers to come to\r\nsome definite understanding as to this question of health; to see how,\r\nby inattention to it, we are defrauded, negatively and positively:\r\nnegatively, by the privation of that 'sweetness and light' which is\r\nthe natural concomitant of good health; positively, by the insertion\r\ninto life of cynicism, ill-temper, and a thousand corroding anxieties\r\nwhich good health would dissipate.  We fear and scorn 'materialism.'\r\nBut he who knew all about it, and could apply his knowledge, might\r\nbecome the preacher of a new gospel.  Not, however, through the\r\necstatic moments of the individual does such knowledge come, but\r\nthrough the revelations of science, in connection with the history of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nWhy should the Roman Catholic Church call gluttony a mortal sin?  Why\r\nshould fasting occupy a place in the disciplines of religion?  What is\r\nthe meaning of Luther's advice to the young clergyman who came to him,\r\nperplexed with the difficulties of predestination and election, if it\r\nbe not that, in virtue of its action upon the brain, when wisely\r\napplied, there is moral and religious virtue even in a hydro-carbon?\r\nTo use the old language, food and drink are creatures of God, and have\r\ntherefore a spiritual value.  Through our neglect of the monitions of\r\na reasonable materialism we sin and suffer daily.  I might here point\r\nto the train of deadly disorders over which science has given modern\r\nsociety such control--disclosing the lair of the material enemy,\r\nensuring his destruction, and thus preventing that moral squalor and\r\nhopelessness which habitually tread on the heels of epidemics in the\r\ncase of the poor.\r\n\r\nRising to higher spheres, the visions of Swedenborg, and the ecstasy\r\nof Plotinus and Porphyry, are phases of that psychical condition,\r\nobviously connected with the nervous system and state of health, on\r\nwhich is based the Vedic doctrine of the absorption of the individual\r\ninto the universal soul.  Plotinus taught the devout how to pass into\r\na condition of ecstasy.  Porphyry complains of having been only once\r\nunited to God in eighty-six years, while his master Plotinus had been\r\nso united six times in sixty years. [Footnote: I recommend to the\r\nreader's particular attention Dr. Draper's important work entitled,\r\n'History of the Conflict between Religion and Science' (Messrs.  H. S.\r\nKing and Co.)]  A friend who knew Wordsworth informs me that the poet,\r\nin some of his moods, was accustomed to seize hold of an external\r\nobject to assure himself of his own bodily existence.  As states of\r\nconsciousness such phenomena have an undisputed reality, and a\r\nsubstantial identity; but they are connected with the most\r\nheterogeneous objective conceptions.  The subjective experiences are\r\nsimilar, because of the similarity of the underlying organisations.\r\n\r\nBut for those who wish to look beyond the practical facts, there will\r\nalways remain ample room for speculation.  Take the argument of the\r\nLucretian introduced in the Belfast Address.  As far as I am aware,\r\nnot one of my assailants has attempted to answer it.  Some of them,\r\nindeed, rejoice over the ability displayed by Bishop Butler in rolling\r\nback the difficulty on his opponent; and they even imagine that it is\r\nthe Bishop's own argument that is there employed.  But the raising of\r\na new difficulty does not abolish--does not even lessen--the old one,\r\nand the argument of the Lucretian remains untouched by anything the\r\nBishop has said or can say.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAnd here it may be permitted me to add a word to an important\r\ncontroversy now going on: and which turns on the question: Do states\r\nof consciousness enter as links into the chain of antecedence and\r\nsequence, which give rise to bodily actions, and to other states of\r\nconsciousness; or are they merely by-products, which are not essential\r\nto the physical processes going on in the brain?  Speaking for myself,\r\nit is certain that I have no power of imagining states of\r\nconsciousness, interposed between the molecules of the brain, and\r\ninfluencing the transference of motion among the molecules.  The\r\nthought 'eludes all mental presentation;' and hence the logic seems\r\nof iron strength which claims for the brain an automatic action,\r\nuninfluenced by states of consciousness.  But it is, I believe,\r\nadmitted by those who hold the automaton-theory, that states of\r\nconsciousness are produced by the marshalling of the molecules of the\r\nbrain: and this production of consciousness by molecular motion is to\r\nme quite as inconceivable on mechanical principles as the production\r\nof molecular motion by consciousness.  If, therefore, I reject one\r\nresult, I must reject both.  I, however, reject neither, and thus\r\nstand in the presence of two Incomprehensibles, instead of one\r\nIncomprehensible.  While accepting fearlessly the facts of materialism\r\ndwelt upon in these pages, I bow my head in the dust before that\r\nmystery of mind, which has hitherto defied its own penetrative power,\r\nand which may ultimately resolve itself into a demonstrable\r\nimpossibility of self-penetration.\r\n\r\nBut the secret is an open one--the practical monitions are plain\r\nenough, which declare that on our dealings with matter depend our weal\r\nand woe, physical and moral.  The state of mind which rebels against\r\nthe recognition of the claims of 'materialism' is not unknown to me.\r\nI can remember a time when I regarded my body as a weed, so much more\r\nhighly did I prize the conscious strength and pleasure derived from\r\nmoral and religious feeling--which, I may add, was mine without the\r\nintervention of dogma.  The error was not an ignoble one, but this did\r\nnot save it from the penalty attached to error.  Saner knowledge\r\ntaught me that the body is no weed, and that treated as such it would\r\ninfallibly avenge itself.  Am I personally lowered by this change of\r\nfront?  Not so.  Give me their health, and there is no spiritual\r\nexperience of those earlier years--no resolve of duty, or work of\r\nmercy, no work of self-renouncement, no solemnity of thought, no joy\r\nin the life and aspects of nature--that would not still be mine; and\r\nthis without the least reference or regard to any purely personal\r\nreward or punishment looming in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have to utter a 'farewell' free from bitterness to all my\r\nreaders; thanking my friends for a sympathy more steadfast, I would\r\nfain believe, if less noisy, than the antipathy of my foes; and\r\ncommending to these a passage from Bishop Butler, which they have\r\neither not read or failed to lay to heart.  'It seems,' saith the\r\nBishop, 'that men would be strangely headstrong and self-willed, and\r\ndisposed to exert themselves with an impetuosity which would render\r\nsociety insupportable, and the living in it impracticable, were it not\r\nfor some acquired moderation and self-government, some aptitude and\r\nreadiness in restraining themselves, and concealing their sense of\r\nthings.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXI.  THE REV. JAMES MARTINEAU AND THE BELFAST ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Fortnightly Review.]\r\n\r\nPRIOR to the publication of the Fifth Edition of these 'Fragments' my\r\nattention had been directed by several estimable, and indeed eminent,\r\npersons, to an essay by the Rev. James Martineau, as demanding\r\nserious consideration at my hands.  I tried to give the essay the\r\nattention claimed for it, and published my views of it as an\r\nIntroduction to Part 11.  of the 'Fragments.' I there referred, and\r\nhere again refer with pleasure, to the accord subsisting between Mr.\r\nMartineau and myself on certain points of biblical Cosmogony. 'In so\r\nfar,' says he, 'as Church belief is still committed to a given\r\nCosmogony and natural history of man, it lies open to scientific\r\nrefutation.' And again: 'It turns out that with the sun and moon and\r\nstars, and in and on the earth, before and after the appearance of our\r\nrace, quite other things have happened than those which the sacred\r\nCosmogony recites.' Once more: 'The whole history of the genesis of\r\nthings Religion must surrender to the Sciences.' Finally, still more\r\nemphatically: 'In the investigation of the genetic order of things,\r\nTheology is an intruder, and must stand aside.' This expresses, only\r\nin words of fuller pith, the views which I ventured to enunciate in\r\nBelfast. 'The impregnable position of Science,' I there say, 'may be\r\nstated in a few words.  We claim, and we shall wrest from Theology,\r\nthe entire domain of Cosmological theory.' Thus Theology, so far as it\r\nis represented by Mr. Martineau, and Science, so far as I understand\r\nit, are in absolute harmony here.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Martineau would have just reason to complain of me, if, by\r\npartial citation, I left my readers under the impression that the\r\nagreement between us is complete.  At the opening of the eighty-ninth\r\nSession of the Manchester New College, London, on October 6, '1874,\r\nhe, its principal, delivered an Address bearing the title 'Religion as\r\naffected by Modern Materialism;' the references and general tone of\r\nwhich make evident the depth of its author's discontent with my\r\nprevious deliverance at Belfast. I find it difficult to grapple with\r\nthe exact grounds of this discontent.  Indeed, logically considered,\r\nthe impression left upon my mind by an essay of great aesthetic merit,\r\ncontaining many passages of exceeding beauty, and many sentiments\r\nwhich none but the pure in heart could utter as they are uttered here,\r\nis vague and unsatisfactory.  The author appears at times so brave and\r\nliberal, at times so timid and captious, and at times, if I dare say\r\nit, so imperfectly informed, regarding the position he assails.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his Address Mr. Martineau states with some\r\ndistinctness his 'sources of religious faith.' They are two--'the\r\nscrutiny of Nature' and 'the interpretation of Sacred Books.' It\r\nwould have been a theme worthy of his intelligence to have deduced\r\nfrom these two sources his religion as it stands.  But not another\r\nword is said about the 'Sacred Books.' Having swept with the besom of\r\nScience various 'books' contemptuously away, he does not define the\r\nSacred residue; much less give us the reasons why he deems them\r\nsacred. [Footnote: Mr. Martineau's use of the term 'sacred' is\r\nunintentionally misleading.  In his later essays we are taught that he\r\ndoes not mean to restrict it to the Bible.  He does not, however,\r\nmention the 'books' beyond those of the Bible to which he would apply\r\nthe term.  1879.]  His references to 'Nature,' on the other hand, are\r\nmagnificent tirades against Nature, intended, apparently, to show the\r\nwholly abominable character of man's antecedents if the theory of\r\nevolution be true.  Here also his mood lacks steadiness.  While\r\njoyfully accepting, at one place, 'the widening space, the deepening\r\nvistas of time, the detected marvels of physiological structure, and\r\nthe rapid filling-in of the missing links in the chain of organic\r\nlife,' he falls, at another, into lamentation and mourning over the\r\nvery theory which renders 'organic life' 'a chain.' He claims the\r\nlargest liberality for his sect, and avows its contempt for the\r\ndangers of possible discovery.  But immediately afterwards he damages\r\nthe claim, and ruins all confidence in the avowal.  He professes\r\nsympathy with modern Science, and almost in the same breath he treats,\r\nor certainly will be understood to treat, the Atomic Theory, and the\r\ndoctrine of the Conservation of Energy, as if they were a kind of\r\nscientific thimble-riggery.\r\n\r\nHis ardour, moreover, renders him inaccurate causing him to see\r\ndiscord between scientific men where nothing but harmony reigns.  In\r\nhis celebrated Address to the Congress of German Naturforscher,\r\ndelivered at Leipzig, three years ago, Du Bois-Reymond speaks thus:\r\n'What conceivable connection subsists between definite movements of\r\ndefinite atoms in my brain, on the one hand, and on the other hand\r\nsuch primordial, indefinable, undeniable, facts as these: I feel pain\r\nor pleasure; I experience a sweet taste, or smell a rose, or hear an\r\norgan, or see something red ... It is absolutely and for ever\r\ninconceivable that a number of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen\r\natoms should be otherwise than indifferent as to their own position\r\nand motion, past, present, or future.  It is utterly inconceivable how\r\nconsciousness should result from their joint action.'\r\n\r\nThis language, which was spoken in 1872, Mr. Martineau 'freely'\r\ntranslates, and quotes against me.  The act is due to misapprehension.\r\nEvidence is at hand to prove that I employed similar language twenty\r\nyears ago.  It is to be found in the 'Saturday Review' for 1860; but\r\na sufficient illustration of the agreement between my friend Du\r\nBois-Reymond and myself, is furnished by the discourse on 'Scientific\r\nMaterialism,' delivered in 1868, then widely circulated, and reprinted\r\nhere.  The reader who compares the two discourses will see that the\r\nsame line of thought is pursued in both, and that perfect agreement\r\nreigns between my friend and me.  In the very Address he criticises,\r\nMr. Martineau might have seen that precisely the same position is\r\nmaintained.  A quotation will prove this: 'Thus far,' I say, 'our way\r\nis clear, but now comes my difficulty.  Your atoms are individually\r\nwithout sensation, much more are they without intelligence.  May I ask\r\nyou, then, to try your hand upon this problem?  Take your dead\r\nhydrogen atoms, your dead oxygen atoms, your dead carbon atoms, your\r\ndead nitrogen atoms, your dead phosphorus atoms, and all the other\r\natoms, dead as grains of shot, of which the brain is formed.  Imagine\r\nthem separate and sensationless; observe them running together and\r\nforming all imaginable combinations.  This, as a purely mechanical\r\nprocess, is seeable by the mind.  But can you see, or dream, or in any\r\nway imagine, how out of that mechanical act, and from these\r\nindividually dead atoms, sensation, thought, and emotion are to rise?\r\nAre you likely to extract Homer out of the rattling of dice, or the\r\nDifferential Calculus out of the clash of billiard balls?  ... I can\r\nfollow a particle of musk until it reaches the olfactory nerve; I can\r\nfollow the waves of sound until their tremors reach the water of the\r\nlabyrinth, and set the otoliths and Corti's fibres in motion; I can\r\nalso visualise the waves of aether as they cross the eye and hit the\r\nretina.  Nay, more, I am able to pursue to the central organ the\r\nmotion thus imparted at the periphery, and to see in idea the very\r\nmolecules of the brain thrown into tremors.  My insight is not baffled\r\nby these physical processes.  What baffles and bewilders me is the\r\nnotion that from these physical tremors things so utterly incongruous\r\nwith them as sensation, thought, and emotion can be derived.' It is\r\nonly a complete misapprehension of our true relationship that could\r\ninduce Mr. Martineau to represent Du Bois-Reymond and myself as\r\nopposed to each other.\r\n\r\n'The affluence of illustration,' writes an able and sympathetic\r\nreviewer of this essay, in the 'New York Tribune,' 'in which Mr.\r\nMartineau delights often impairs the distinctness of his statements by\r\ndiverting the attention of the reader from the essential points of his\r\ndiscussion to the beauty of his imagery, and thus diminishes their\r\npower of conviction.  'To the beauties here referred to I bear willing\r\ntestimony; but the reviewer is strictly just in his estimate of their\r\neffect upon my critic's logic.  The 'affluence of illustration,' and\r\nthe heat, and haze, and haste, generated by its reaction upon Mr.\r\nMartineau's own mind, often produce vagueness where precision is the\r\none thing needful--poetic fervour where we require judicial calm; and\r\npractical unfairness where the strictest justice ought to be, and I\r\nwillingly believe is meant to be, observed.\r\n\r\nIn one of his nobler passages Mr. Martineau tells us how the pupils of\r\nhis college have been educated hitherto: 'They have been trained\r\nunder the assumptions (1) that the Universe which includes us and\r\nfolds us round is the life-dwelling of an Eternal Mind; (2) that the\r\nworld of our abode is the scene of a moral government, incipient but\r\nnot complete; and (3) that the upper zones of human affection, above\r\nthe clouds of self and passion, take us into the sphere of a Divine\r\nCommunion.  Into this over-arching scene it is that growing thought\r\nand enthusiasm have expanded to catch their light and fire.'\r\n\r\nAlpine summits seem to kindle above us as we read these glowing words;\r\nwe see their beauty and feel their life.  At the close of one of the\r\nessays here printed, [Footnote: 'Scientific Use of the Imagination.']\r\nI thus refer to the 'Communion' which Mr. Martineau calls 'Divine':\r\n\"Two things,\" said Immanuel Kant, \"fill me with awe--the starry heavens,\r\nand the sense of moral responsibility in man.\"  And in his hours of\r\nhealth and strength and sanity, when the stroke of action has ceased,\r\nand the pause of reflection has set in, the scientific investigator\r\nfinds himself overshadowed by the same awe.  Breaking contact with the\r\nhampering details of earth, it associates him with a power which gives\r\nfulness and tone to his existence, but which he can neither analyse\r\nnor comprehend.  Though 'knowledge' is here disavowed, the 'feelings',\r\nof Mr. Martineau and myself are, I think, very much alike.  He,\r\nnevertheless, censures me--almost denounces me--for referring Religion\r\nto the region of Emotion.  Surely he is inconsistent here. The\r\nforegoing words refer to an inward hue or temperature, rather than to\r\nan external object of thought.  When I attempt to give the Power which\r\nI see manifested in the Universe an objective form, personal or\r\notherwise, it slips away from me, declining all intellectual\r\nmanipulation.  I dare not, save poetically, use the pronoun 'He'\r\nregarding it; I dare not call it a 'Mind;' I refuse to call it even a\r\n'Cause.' Its mystery overshadows me; but it remains a mystery, while\r\nthe objective frames which some of my neighbours try to make it fit,\r\nseem to me to distort and desecrate it.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with Mr. Martineau, and hence his discontent.  He\r\nprofesses to know where I only claim to feel.  He could make his\r\ncontention good against me if, by a process of verification, he would\r\ntransform his assumptions into 'objective knowledge.' But he makes no\r\nattempt to do so.  They remain assumptions from the beginning of his\r\nAddress to its end.  And yet he frequently uses the word 'unverified,'\r\nas if it were fatal to the position oh which its incidence falls.\r\n'The scrutiny of Nature' is one of his sources of 'religious faith:'\r\nwhat logical foothold does that scrutiny furnish, on which any one of\r\nthe foregoing three assumptions could be planted? Nature, according to\r\nhis picturing, is base and cruel: what is the inference to be drawn\r\nregarding its Author?  If Nature be 'red in tooth and claw,' who is\r\nresponsible?  On a Mindless nature Mr. Martineau pours the full\r\ntorrent of his gorgeous invective; but could the 'assumption' of 'an\r\nEternal Mind'--even of a Beneficent Eternal Mind--render the world\r\nobjectively a whit less mean and ugly than it is?  Not an iota.  It is\r\nman's feelings, and not external phenomena, that are influenced by the\r\nassumption.  It adds not a ray of light nor a strain of music to the\r\nobjective sum of things.  It does not touch the phenomena of physical\r\nnature--storm, flood, or fire--nor diminish by a pang the bloody\r\ncombats of the animal world.  But it does add the glow of religious\r\nemotion to the human soul, as represented by Mr. Martineau.  Beyond\r\nthis I defy him to go; and yet he rashly--it might be said\r\npetulantly--kicks away the only philosophic foundation on which it is\r\npossible for him to build his religion.\r\n\r\nHe twits incidentally the modern scientific interpretation of nature\r\nbecause of its want of cheerfulness.  Let the new future,' he says,\r\n'preach its own gospel, and devise, if it can, the means of making the\r\ntidings glad.' This is a common argument: 'If you only knew the\r\ncomfort of belief!'  My reply is that I choose the nobler part of\r\nEmerson, when, after various disenchantments, he exclaimed, 'I covet\r\ntruth!' The gladness of true heroism visits the heart of him who is\r\nreally competent to say this.  Besides, 'gladness' is an emotion, and\r\nMr. Martineau theoretically scorns the emotional.  I am not, however,\r\nacquainted with a writer who draws more largely upon this source,\r\nwhile mistaking it for something objective.  'To reach the Cause,' he\r\nsays, 'there is no need to go into the past, as though being missed\r\nhere, He could be found there.  But when once He has been apprehended\r\nby the proper organs of divine apprehension, the whole life of\r\nHumanity is recognised as the scene of His agency.' That Mr. Martineau\r\nshould have lived so long, thought so much, and failed to recognise\r\nthe entirely subjective character of this creed, is highly\r\ninstructive.  His 'proper organs of divine apprehension '--given, we\r\nmust assume, to Mr. Martineau and his pupils, but denied to many of\r\nthe greatest intellects and noblest men in this and other ages--lie at\r\nthe very core of his emotions.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is when Mr. Martineau is most purely emotional that he\r\nscorns the emotions; it is when he is most purely subjective that he\r\nrejects subjectivity.  He pays a just and liberal tribute to the\r\ncharacter of John Stuart Mill.  But in the light of Mill's philosophy,\r\nbenevolence, honour, purity, having 'shrunk into mere unaccredited\r\nsubjective susceptibilities, have lost all support from Omniscient\r\napproval, and all presumable accordance with the reality of things.'\r\nIf Mr. Martineau had given them any inkling of the process by which he\r\nrenders the 'subjective susceptibilities' objective, or how he arrives\r\nat an objective ground of 'Omniscient approval,' gratitude from his\r\npupils would have been his just meed.  But, as it is, he leaves them\r\nlost in an iridescent cloud of words, after exciting a desire which he\r\nis incompetent to appease.\r\n\r\n'We are,' he says, in another place, 'for ever shaping our\r\nrepresentations of invisible things into forms of definite opinion,\r\nand throwing them to the front, as if they were the photographic\r\nequivalent of our real faith.  It is a delusion which affects us all.\r\nYet somehow the essence of our religion never finds its way into these\r\nframes of theory: as we put them together it slips away, and, if we\r\nturn to pursue it, still retreats behind; ever ready to work with the\r\nwill, to unbind and sweeten the affections, and bathe the life with\r\nreverence, but refusing to be seen, or to pass from a divine hue of\r\nthinking into a human pattern of thought.' This is very beautiful, and\r\nmainly so because the man who utters it obviously brings it all out of\r\nthe treasury of his own heart.  But the 'hue' and 'pattern' here so\r\nfinely spoken of, the former refusing to pass into the latter, are\r\nneither more nor less than that 'emotion,' on the one hand, and that\r\n'objective knowledge,' on the other, which have drawn this suicidal\r\nfire from Mr. Martineau's battery.\r\n\r\nI now come to one of the most serious portions of Mr. Martineau's\r\npamphlet--serious far less on account of its 'personal errors,' than\r\nof its intrinsic gravity, though its author has thought fit to give it\r\na witty and sarcastic tone.  He analyses and criticises 'the\r\nmaterialist doctrine, which, in our time, is proclaimed with so much\r\npomp, and resisted with so much passion.  \"Matter is all I want,\" says\r\nthe physicist; \"give me its atoms alone, and I will explain the\r\nuniverse.\"' It is thought, even by Mr. Martineau's intimate friends,\r\nthat in this pamphlet he is answering me.  I must therefore ask the\r\nreader to contrast the foregoing travesty with what I really do say\r\nregarding atoms: 'I do not think that he [the materialist] is entitled\r\nto say that his molecular groupings and motions _explain_ everything.\r\nIn reality, they explain nothing.  The utmost he can affirm is the\r\nassociation of two classes of phenomena, of whose real bond of union\r\nhe is in absolute ignorance.' [Footnote: Address on 'Scientific\r\nMaterialism.']  This is very different from saying, 'Give me its atoms\r\nalone, and I will explain the universe.'  Mr. Martineau continues his\r\ndialogue with the physicist: '\"Good,\" he says; \"take as many atoms as\r\nyou please.  See that they have all that is requisite to Body [a\r\nmetaphysical B], being homogeneous extended solids.\" \"That is not\r\nenough,\" his physicist replies; \"it might do for Democritus and the\r\nmathematicians, but I must have something more.  The atoms must not\r\nonly be in motion, and of various shapes, but also of as many kinds as\r\nthere are chemical elements; for how could I ever get water if I had\r\nonly hydrogen elements to work with?\" \"So be it,\" Mr. Martineau\r\nconsents to answer, \"only this is a considerable enlargement of your\r\nspecified datum [where, and by whom specified?]--in fact, a conversion\r\nof it into several; yet, even at the cost of its monism [put into it\r\nby Mr. Martineau], your scheme seems hardly to gain its end; for by\r\nwhat manipulation of your resources will you, for example, educe\r\nConsciousness?\"'\r\n\r\nThis reads like pleasantry, but it deals with serious things.  For the\r\nlast seven years the question here proposed by Mr. Martineau, and my\r\nanswer to it, have been accessible to all.  The question, in my words,\r\nis briefly this: 'A man can say, \"I feel, I think, I love,\" but how\r\ndoes consciousness infuse itself into the problem?' And here is my\r\nanswer: The passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding\r\nfacts of consciousness is unthinkable.  Granted that a definite\r\nthought and a definite molecular action in the brain occur\r\nsimultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ, nor\r\napparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us to pass,\r\nby a process of reasoning, from the one to the other.  They appear\r\ntogether, but we do not know why.  Were our minds and senses so\r\nexpanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and\r\nfeel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all\r\ntheir motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if\r\nsuch there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the\r\ncorresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as\r\never from the solution of the problem, \"How are these physical\r\nprocesses connected with the facts of consciousness?\"  The chasm\r\nbetween the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually\r\nimpassable.' [Footnote: Bishop Butler's reply to the Lucretian in the\r\n'Belfast Address' is all in the same strain.]\r\n\r\nCompare this with the answer which Mr. Martineau puts into the mouth\r\nof his physicist, and with which I am generally credited by Mr.\r\nMartineau's readers, both in England and America--'\"It [the problem of\r\nconsciousness] does not daunt me at all.  Of course you understand\r\nthat all along my atoms have been affected by gravitation and\r\npolarity; and now I have only to insist with Fechner on a difference\r\namong molecules: there are the inorganic, which can change only their\r\nplace, like the particles in an undulation; and there are the organic,\r\nwhich can change their order, as in a globule that turns itself inside\r\nout.  With an adequate number of these our problem will be\r\nmanageable.\"  \"Likely enough,\" we may say [\"entirely unlikely,\" say\r\nI], \"seeing how careful you are to provide for all emergencies; and\r\nif any hitch should occur in the next step, where you will have to\r\npass from mere sentiency to thought and will, you can again look in\r\nupon your atoms, and fling among them a handful of Leibnitz's monads,\r\nto serve as souls in little, and be ready, in a latent form, with that\r\nVorstellungs-faehigkeit which our picturesque interpreters of nature\r\nso much prize.\"'\r\n\r\n'But surely,' continues Mr. Martineau, 'you must observe that this\r\n\"matter\" of yours alters its style with every change of service:\r\nstarting as a beggar with scarce a rag of \"property\" to cover its\r\nbones, it turns up as a prince when large undertakings are wanted. \"We\r\nmust radically change our notions of matter,\" says Professor Tyndall;\r\nand then, he ventures to believe, it will answer all demands, carrying\r\n\"the promise and potency of all terrestrial life.\"  If the measure of\r\nthe required \"change in our notions\" had been specified, the\r\nproposition would have had a real meaning, and been susceptible of a\r\ntest. It is easy travelling through the stages of such an hypothesis;\r\nyou deposit at your bank a round sum ere you start, and, drawing on it\r\npiecemeal at every pause, complete your grand tour without a debt.'\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph of this argument is forcibly and ably stated.  On\r\nit I am willing to try conclusions with Mr. Martineau.  I may say, in\r\npassing, that I share his contempt for the picturesque interpretation\r\nof nature, if accuracy of vision be thereby impaired.  But the term\r\nVorstellungs-faehigkeit, as used by me, means the power of definite\r\nmental presentation, of attaching to words the corresponding objects\r\nof thought, and of seeing these in their proper relations, without the\r\ninterior haze and soft penumbral borders which the theologian loves.\r\nTo this mode of interpreting nature' I shall to the best of my ability\r\nnow adhere.\r\n\r\nNeither of us, I trust, will be afraid or ashamed to begin at the\r\nalphabet of this question.  Our first effort must be to understand\r\neach other, and this mutual understanding can only be ensured by\r\nbeginning low down.  Physically speaking, however, we need not go\r\nbelow the sea-level.  Let us then travel in company to the Caribbean\r\nSea, and halt upon the heated water.  What is that sea, and what is\r\nthe sun that heats it?  Answering for myself, I say that they are both\r\nmatter.  I fill a glass with the sea-water and expose it on the deck\r\nof the vessel; after some time the liquid has all disappeared, and\r\nleft a solid residue of salt in the glass behind.  We have mobility,\r\ninvisibility--apparent annihilation.  In virtue of\r\n\r\n    The glad and secret aid\r\n    The sun unto the ocean paid,\r\n\r\nthe water has taken to itself wings and flown off as vapour.  From the\r\nwhole surface of the Caribbean Sea such vapour is rising: and now we\r\nmust follow it--not upon our legs, however, nor in a ship, nor even in\r\na balloon, but by the mind's eye--in other words, by that power of\r\nVorstellung which Mr. Martineau knows so well, and which he so justly\r\nscorns when it indulges in loose practices.\r\n\r\nCompounding, then, the northward motion of the vapour with the earth's\r\naxial rotation, we track our fugitive through the higher atmospheric\r\nregions, obliquely across the Atlantic Ocean to Western Europe, and on\r\nto our familiar Alps.  Here another wonderful metamorphosis occurs.\r\nFloating on the cold calm air, and in presence of the cold firmament,\r\nthe vapour condenses, not only to particles of water, but to particles\r\nof crystalline water.  These coalesce to stars of snow, which fall\r\nupon the mountains in forms so exquisite that, when first seen, they\r\nnever fail to excite rapture.  As to beauty, indeed, they put the work\r\nof the lapidary to shame, while as to accuracy they render concrete\r\nthe abstractions of the geometer.  Are these crystals 'matter'?\r\nWithout presuming to dogmatise, I answer for myself in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\nStill, a formative power has obviously here come into play which did\r\nnot manifest itself in either the liquid or the vapour.  The question\r\nnow is, Was not the power 'potential' in both of them, requiring only\r\nthe proper conditions of temperature to bring it into action?  Again I\r\nanswer for myself in the affirmative.  I am, however, quite willing to\r\ndiscuss with Mr. Martineau the alternative hypothesis, that an\r\nimponderable formative soul unites itself with the substance after its\r\nescape from the liquid state.  If he should espouse this hypothesis,\r\nthen I should demand of him an immediate exercise of that\r\nVorstellungs-faehigkeit, with which, in my efforts to think clearly, I\r\ncan never dispense.  I should ask, At what moment did the soul come\r\nin?  Did it enter at once or by degrees; perfect from the first, or\r\ngrowing and perfecting itself contemporaneously with its own\r\nhandiwork?  I should also ask whether it is localised or diffused?\r\nDoes it move about as a lonely builder, putting the bits of solid\r\nwater in their places as soon as the proper temperature has set in? or\r\nis it distributed through the entire mass of the crystal?  If the\r\nlatter, then the soul has the shape of the crystal; but if the former,\r\nthen I should enquire after its shape.  Has it legs or arms?  If not,\r\nI would ask it to be made clear to me how a thing without these\r\nappliances can act so perfectly the part of a builder?  (I insist on\r\ndefinition, and ask unusual questions, if haply I might thereby banish\r\nunmeaning words.) What were the condition and residence of the soul\r\nbefore it joined the crystal?  What becomes of it when the crystal is\r\ndissolved?  Why should a particular temperature be needed before it\r\ncan exercise its vocation?  Finally, is the problem before us in any\r\nway simplified by the assumption of its existence?  I think it\r\nprobable that, after a full discussion of the question, Mr. Martineau\r\nwould agree with me in ascribing the building power displayed in the\r\ncrystal to the bits of water themselves.  At all events, I should\r\ncount upon his sympathy so far as to believe that he would consider\r\nany one unmannerly who would denounce me for rejecting this notion of\r\na separate soul, and for holding the snow-crystal to be matter.'\r\n\r\nBut then what an astonishing addition is here made to the powers of\r\nMatter!  Who would have dreamt, without actually seeing its work, that\r\nsuch a power was locked up in a drop of water?  All that we needed to\r\nmake the action of the liquid intelligible was the assumption of Mr.\r\nMartineau's 'homogeneous extended atomic solids,' smoothly gliding\r\nover one another.  But had we supposed the water to be nothing more\r\nthan this, we should have ignorantly defrauded it of an intrinsic\r\narchitectural power, which the art of man, even when pushed to its\r\nutmost degree of refinement, is incompetent to imitate.  I would\r\ninvite Mr. Martineau to consider how inappropriate his figure of a\r\nfictitious bank deposit becomes under these circumstances. The\r\n'account current' of matter receives nothing at my hands which could\r\nbe honestly kept back from it.  If, then, 'Democritus and the\r\nmathematicians' so defined matter as to exclude the powers here proved\r\nto belong to it, they were clearly wrong, and Mr. Martineau, instead\r\nof twitting me with my departure from them, ought rather to applaud me\r\nfor correcting them. [Footnote: Definition implies previous\r\nexamination of the object defined, and is open to correction or\r\nmodification as knowledge of the object increases.  Such increased\r\nknowledge has radically changed our conceptions of the luminiferous\r\naether, converting its vibrations from longitudinal into transverse.\r\nSuch changes also Mr. Martineau's conceptions of matter are doomed to\r\nundergo.]\r\n\r\nThe reader of my small contributions to the literature which deals\r\nwith the overlapping margins of Science and Theology, will have\r\nnoticed how frequently I quote Mr. Emerson.  I do so mainly because in\r\nhim we have a poet and a profoundly religious man, who is really and\r\nentirely undaunted by the discoveries of Science, past, present, or\r\nprospective.  In his case Poetry, with the joy of a bacchanal, takes\r\nher graver brother Science by the hand, and cheers him with immortal\r\nlaughter.  By Emerson scientific conceptions are continually\r\ntransmuted into the finer forms and warmer hues of an ideal world. Our\r\npresent theme is touched upon in the lines--\r\n\r\n    The journeying atoms, primordial wholes\r\n    Firmly draw, firmly drive by their animate poles.\r\n\r\nAs regards veracity and insight these few words outweigh, in my\r\nestimation, all the formal learning expended by Mr. Martineau in those\r\ndisquisitions on Force, where he treats the physicist as a conjuror,\r\nand speaks so wittily of atomic polarity.  In fact, without this\r\nnotion of polarity--this 'drawing' and 'driving'--this attraction and\r\nrepulsion, we stand as stupidly dumb before the phenomena of\r\nCrystallisation as a Bushman before the phenomena of the Solar System.\r\nThe genesis and growth of the notion I have endeavoured to make clear\r\nin my third Lecture on Light, and in the article on 'Matter and Force'\r\npublished in this volume.\r\n\r\nOur further course is here foreshadowed.  A Sunday or two ago I stood\r\nunder an oak planted by Sir John Moore, the hero of Corunna.  On the\r\nground near the tree little oaklets were successfully fighting for\r\nlife with the surrounding vegetation.  The acorns had dropped into the\r\nfriendly soil, and this was the result of their interaction.  What is\r\nthe acorn?  what the earth?  and what the sun, without whose heat and\r\nlight the tree could not become a tree, however rich the soil, and\r\nhowever healthy the seed?  I answer for myself as before--all\r\n'matter.' And the heat and light which here play so potent a part are\r\nacknowledged to be motions of matter.  By taking something much lower\r\ndown in the vegetable kingdom than the oak, we might approach much\r\nmore nearly to the case of crystallisation already discussed; but this\r\nis not now necessary.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of conceding the sufficiency of matter here, Mr. Martineau\r\nshould fly to the hypothesis of a vegetative soul, all the questions\r\nbefore asked in relation to the snow-star become pertinent.  I would\r\ninvite him to go over them one by one, and consider what replies he\r\nwill make to them.  He may retort by asking me, 'Who infused the\r\nprinciple of life into the tree?' I say, in answer, that our present\r\nquestion is not this, but another--not who made the tree, but what is\r\nit?  Is there anything besides matter in the tree?  If so, what,\r\nand where?  Mr. Martineau may have begun by this time to discern\r\nthat it is not 'picturesqueness,' but cold precision, that my\r\nVorstellungs-faehigkeit demands.  How, I would ask, is this vegetative\r\nsoul to be presented to the mind?  where did it flourish before the\r\ntree grew?  and what will become of it when the tree is sawn into\r\nplanks, or consumed in fire?\r\n\r\nPossibly Mr. Martineau may consider the assumption of this soul to be\r\nas untenable and as useless as I do.  But then if the power to build a\r\ntree be conceded to pure matter, what an amazing expansion of our\r\nnotions of the 'potency of matter' is implied in the concession' Think\r\nof the acorn, of the earth, and of the solar light and heat--was ever\r\nsuch necromancy dreamt of as the production of that massive trunk,\r\nthose swaying boughs and whispering leaves, from the interaction of\r\nthese three factors?  In this interaction, moreover, consists what we\r\ncall life.  It will be seen that I am not in the least insensible to\r\nthe wonder of the tree; nay, I should not be surprised if, in the\r\npresence of this wonder, I feel more perplexed and overwhelmed than\r\nMr. Martineau himself.\r\n\r\nConsider it for a moment.  There is an experiment, first made by\r\nWheatstone, where the music of a piano is transferred from its\r\nsound-board, through a thin wooden rod, across several silent rooms in\r\nsuccession, and poured out at a distance from the instrument.  The\r\nstrings of the piano vibrate, not singly, but ten at a time.  Every\r\nstring subdivides, yielding not one note, but a dozen.  All these\r\nvibrations and subvibrations are crowded together into a bit of deal\r\nnot more than a quarter of a square inch in section.  Yet no note is\r\nlost. Each vibration asserts its individual rights; and all are, at\r\nlast, shaken forth into the air by a second sound-board, against which\r\nthe distant end of the rod presses.  Thought ends in amazement when it\r\nseeks to realise the motions of that rod as the music flows through\r\nit.  I turn to my tree and observe its roots, its trunk, its branches,\r\nand its leaves.  As the rod conveys the music, and yields it up to the\r\ndistant air, so does the trunk convey the matter and the motion--the\r\nshocks and pulses and other vital actions--which eventually emerge in\r\nthe umbrageous foliage of the tree.  I went some time ago through the\r\ngreenhouse of a friend.  He had ferns from Ceylon, the branches of\r\nwhich were in some cases not much thicker than an ordinary pin--hard,\r\nsmooth, and cylindrical--often leafless for a foot or more.  But at\r\nthe end of every one of them the unsightly twig unlocked the exuberant\r\nbeauty hidden within it, and broke forth into a mass of fronds, almost\r\nlarge enough to fill the arms.  We stand here upon a higher level of\r\nthe wonderful: we are conscious of a music subtler than that of the\r\npiano, passing unheard through these tiny boughs, and issuing in what\r\nMr. Martineau would opulently call the 'clustered magnificence' of the\r\nleaves.  Does it lessen my amazement to know that every cluster, and\r\nevery leaf--their form and texture--lie, like the music in the rod, in\r\nthe molecular structure of these apparently insignificant stems? Not\r\nso.  Mr. Martineau weeps for' the beauty of the flower fading into a\r\nnecessity.' I care not whether it comes to me through necessity or\r\nthrough freedom, my delight in it is all the same.  I see what he sees\r\nwith a wonder superadded.  To me, as to him, not even Solomon in all\r\nhis glory was arrayed like one of these.\r\n\r\nI have spoken above as if the assumption of a soul would save Mr.\r\nMartineau from the inconsistency of crediting pure matter with the\r\nastonishing building power displayed in crystals and trees.  This,\r\nhowever, would not be the necessary result; for it would remain to be\r\nproved that the soul assumed is not itself matter.  When a boy I\r\nlearnt from Dr. Watts that the souls of conscious brutes are mere\r\nmatter.  And the man who would claim for matter the human soul itself,\r\nwould find himself in very orthodox company.  'All that is erected,'\r\nsays Fauste, a famous French bishop of the fifth century, 'is matter.\r\nThe soul occupies a place; it is enclosed in a body; it quits the body\r\nat death, and returns to it at the resurrection, as in the case of\r\nLazarus; the distinction between Hell and Heaven, between eternal\r\npleasures and eternal pains, proves that, even after death, souls\r\noccupy a place and are corporeal.  God only is incorporeal.'\r\nTertullian, moreover, was quite a physicist in the definiteness of his\r\nconceptions regarding the soul.  'The materiality of the soul,' he\r\nsays, 'is evident from the evangelists.  A human soul is there\r\nexpressly pictured as suffering in hell; it is placed in the middle of\r\na flame, its tongue feels a cruel agony, and it implores a drop of\r\nwater at the hands of a happier soul.  Wanting materiality,' adds\r\nTertullian, 'all this would be without meaning.' [Footnote: The\r\nforegoing extracts, which M. Alglave recently brought to light for the\r\nbenefit of the Bishop of Orleans, are taken from the sixth Lecture of\r\nthe 'Cours d'Histoire Moderns' of that most orthodox of statesmen, M.\r\nGuizot.  'I could multiply,' continues M. Guizot, 'these citations to\r\ninfinity, and they prove that in the first centuries of our era the\r\nmateriality of the soul was an opinion not only permitted, but\r\ndominant.' Dr. Moriarty, and the synod which he recently addressed,\r\nobviously forget their own antecedents. Their boasted succession from\r\nthe early Church renders them the direct offspring of a 'materialism'\r\nmore 'brutal' than any ever enunciated by me.]\r\n\r\nI have glanced at inorganic nature--at the sea, and the sun, and the\r\nvapour, and the snow-flake, and at organic nature as represented by\r\nthe fern and the oak.  That same sun which warmed the water and\r\nliberated the vapour, exerts a subtler power on the nutriment of the\r\ntree.  It takes hold of matter wholly unfit for the purposes of\r\nnutrition, separates its nutritive from its non-nutritive portions,\r\ngives, the former to the vegetable, and carries the others away.\r\nPlanted in the earth, bathed by the air, and tended by the sun, the\r\ntree is traversed by its sap, the cells are formed, the woody fibre is\r\nspun, and the whole is woven to a texture wonderful even to the naked\r\neye, but a million-fold more so to microscopic vision.  Does\r\nconsciousness mix in any way with these processes?  No man can tell.\r\nOur only ground for a negative conclusion is the absence of those\r\noutward manifestations from which feeling is usually inferred.  But\r\neven these are not entirely absent.  In the greenhouses of Kew we may\r\nsee that a leaf can close, in response to a proper stimulus, as\r\npromptly as the human fingers themselves; and while there Dr. Hooker\r\nwill tell us of the wondrous fly-catching and fly-devouring power of\r\nthe Dionaea.  No man can say that the feelings of the animal are not\r\nrepresented by a drowsier consciousness in the vegetable world.  At\r\nall events, no line has ever been drawn between the conscious and the\r\nunconscious; for the vegetable shades into the animal by such fine\r\ngradations, that is impossible to say where the one ends and the other\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nIn all such enquiries we are necessarily limited by our own powers: we\r\nobserve what our senses, armed with the aids furnished by Science,\r\nenable us to observe; nothing more.  The evidences as to consciousness\r\nin the vegetable world depend wholly upon our capacity to observe and\r\nweigh them.  Alter the capacity, and the evidence would alter too.\r\nWould that which to us is a total absence of any manifestation of\r\nconsciousness be the same to a being with our capacities indefinitely\r\nmultiplied?  To such a being I can imagine not only the vegetable, but\r\nthe mineral world, responsive to the proper irritants, the response\r\ndiffering only in degree from those exaggerated manifestations, which,\r\nin virtue of their magnitude, appeal to our weak powers of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion, however, must be based, not on powers that we imagine,\r\nbut upon those that we possess.  What do they reveal?  As the earth\r\nand atmosphere offer themselves as the nutriment of the vegetable\r\nworld, so does the latter, which contains no constituent not found in\r\ninorganic nature, offer itself to the animal world.  Mixed with\r\ncertain inorganic substances--water, for example--the vegetable\r\nconstitutes, in the long run, the sole sustenance of the animal.\r\nAnimals may be divided into two classes, the first of which can\r\nutilise the vegetable world immediately, having chemical forces strong\r\nenough to cope with its most refractory parts; the second class use\r\nthe vegetable world mediately; that is to say, after its finer\r\nportions have been extracted and stored up by the first. But in\r\nneither class have we an atom newly created.  The animal world is, so\r\nto say, a distillation through the vegetable world from inorganic\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view all three worlds would constitute a unity, in\r\nwhich I picture life as immanent everywhere.  Nor am I anxious to shut\r\nout the idea that the life here spoken of, may be but a subordinate\r\npart and function of a Higher Life, as the living moving blood is\r\nsubordinate to the living man.  I resist no such idea as long as it is\r\nnot dogmatically imposed.  Left for the human mind freely to operate\r\nupon, the idea has ethical vitality; but, stiffened into a dogma, the\r\ninner force disappears, and the outward yoke of a usurping hierarchy\r\ntakes its place.\r\n\r\nThe problem before us is, at all events, capable of definite\r\nstatement.  We have on the one hand strong grounds for concluding that\r\nthe earth was once a molten mass.  We now find it not only swathed by\r\nan atmosphere, and covered by a sea, but also crowded with living\r\nthings.  The question is, How were they introduced?  Certainty may be\r\nas unattainable here as Bishop Butler held it to be in matters of\r\nreligion; but in the contemplation of probabilities the thoughtful\r\nmind is forced to take a side.  The conclusion of Science, which\r\nrecognises unbroken causal connection between the past and the\r\npresent, would undoubtedly be that the molten earth contained within\r\nit elements of life, which grouped themselves into their present forms\r\nas the planet cooled.  The difficulty and reluctance encountered by\r\nthis conception, arise solely from the fact that the theologic\r\nconception obtained a prior footing in the human mind.  Did the latter\r\ndepend upon reasoning alone, it could not hold its ground for an hour\r\nagainst its rival.  But it is warmed into life and strength by\r\nassociated hopes and fears--and not only by these, which are more or\r\nless mean, but by that loftiness of thought and feeling which lifts\r\nits possessor above the atmosphere of self, and which the theologic\r\nidea, in its nobler forms, has engendered in noble minds.\r\n\r\nWere not man's origin implicated, we should accept without a murmur\r\nthe derivation of animal and vegetable life from what we call\r\ninorganic nature.  The conclusion of pure intellect points this way\r\nand no other.  But the purity is troubled by our interests in this\r\nlife, and by our hopes and fears regarding the life to come.  Reason\r\nis traversed by the emotions, anger rising in the weaker heads to the\r\nheight of suggesting that the suppression of the enquirer by the arm\r\nof the law would be an act agreeable to God, and serviceable to man.\r\nBut this foolishness is more than neutralised by the sympathy of the\r\nwise; and in England at least, so long as the courtesy which befits an\r\nearnest theme is adhered to, such sympathy is ever ready for an honest\r\nman.  None of us here need shrink from saying all that he has a right\r\nto say.  We ought, however, to remember that it is not only a band of\r\nJesuits, weaving their schemes of intellectual slavery, under the\r\ninnocent guise 'of education,' that we are opposing.  Our foes are to\r\nsome extent of our own household, including not only the ignorant and\r\nthe passionate, but a minority of minds of high calibre and culture,\r\nlovers of freedom moreover, who, though its objective bull be riddled\r\nby logic, still find the ethic life of their religion unimpaired.  But\r\nwhile such considerations ought to influence the form of our argument,\r\nand prevent it from ever slipping out of the region of courtesy into\r\nthat of scorn or abuse, its substance, I think, ought to be maintained\r\nand presented in unmitigated strength.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1855 the chair of philosophy in the University of Munich\r\nhappened to be filled by a Catholic priest of great critical\r\npenetration, great learning, and great courage, who had borne the\r\nbrunt of battle long before Doellinger.  His Jesuit colleagues, he\r\nknew, inculcated the belief that every human soul is sent into the\r\nworld from God by a separate and supernatural act of creation.  In a\r\nwork entitled the 'Origin of the Human Soul,' Professor Frohschammer,\r\nthe philosopher here alluded to, was hardy enough to question this\r\ndoctrine, and to affirm that man, body and soul, comes from his\r\nparents, the act of creation being, therefore, mediate and secondary\r\nonly.  The Jesuits keep a sharp look out on all temerities of this\r\nkind; and their organ, the 'Civilità Cattolica,' immediately pounced\r\nupon Frohschammer.  His book was branded as 'pestilent,' placed in the\r\nIndex, and stamped with the condemnation of the Church. [Footnote:\r\nKing Maximilian II. brought Liebig to Munich, he helped Helmholtz in\r\nhis researches, and loved to liberate and foster science.  But through\r\nhis liberal concession of power to the Jesuits in the schools, he did\r\nfar more damage to the intellectual freedom of his country than his\r\nsuperstitious predecessor Ludwig I.  Priding himself on being a German\r\nPrince, Ludwig would not tolerate the interference of the Roman party\r\nwith the political affairs of Bavaria.]  The Jesuit notion does not\r\nerr on the score of indefiniteness.  According to it, the Power whom\r\nGoethe does not dare to name, and whom Gassendi and Clerk Maxwell\r\npresent to us under the guise of a 'Manufacturer' of atoms, turns out\r\nannually, for England and Wales alone, a quarter of a million of new\r\nsouls.  Taken in connection with the dictum of Mr. Carlyle, that this\r\nannual increment to our population are 'mostly fools,' but little\r\nprofit to the human heart seems derivable from this mode of regarding\r\nthe Divine operations.\r\n\r\nBut if the Jesuit notion be rejected, what are we to accept?\r\nPhysiologists say that every human being comes from an egg not more\r\nthan the 1/120th of an inch in diameter.  Is this egg matter?  I hold\r\nit to be so, as much as the seed of a fern or of an oak.  Nine months\r\ngo to the making of it into a man.  Are the additions made during this\r\nperiod of gestation drawn from matter?  I think so undoubtedly.  If\r\nthere be anything besides matter in the egg, or in the infant\r\nsubsequently slumbering in the womb, what is it?  The questions\r\nalready asked with reference to the stars of snow may be here\r\nrepeated.  Mr. Martineau will complain that I am disenchanting the\r\nbabe of its wonder; but is this the case?  I figure it growing in the\r\nwomb, woven by a something not itself, without conscious participation\r\non the part of either father or mother, and appearing in due time a\r\nliving miracle, with all its organs and all their implications.\r\nConsider the work accomplished during these nine months in forming the\r\neye alone--with its lens, and its humours, and its miraculous retina\r\nbehind.  Consider the ear with its tympanum, cochlea, and Corti's\r\norgan--an instrument of three thousand strings, built adjacent to the\r\nbrain, and employed by it to sift, separate, and interpret, antecedent\r\nto all consciousness, the sonorous tremors of the external world.  All\r\nthis has been accomplished, not only without man's contrivance, but\r\nwithout his knowledge, the secret of his own organisation having been\r\nwithheld from him since his birth in the immeasurable past, until\r\nthese latter days.  Matter I define as that mysterious thing by which\r\nall this is accomplished.  How it came to have this power is a\r\nquestion on which I never ventured an opinion.  If, then, Matter\r\nstarts as 'a beggar,' it is, in my view, because the Jacobs of\r\ntheology have deprived it of its birthright.  Mr. Martineau need fear\r\nno disenchantment.  Theories of evolution go but a short way towards\r\nthe explanation of this mystery; the Ages, let us hope, will at length\r\ngive us a Poet competent to deal with it aright.\r\n\r\nThere are men, and they include amongst them some of the best of the\r\nrace of man, upon whose minds this mystery falls without producing\r\neither warmth or colour.  The 'dry light' of the intellect suffices\r\nfor them, and they live their noble lives untouched by a desire to\r\ngive the mystery shape or expression.  There are, on the other hand,\r\nmen whose minds are warmed and coloured by its presence, and who,\r\nunder its stimulus, attain to moral heights which have never been\r\novertopped.  Different spiritual climates are necessary for the\r\nhealthy existence of these two classes of men; and different climates\r\nmust be accorded them.  The history of humanity, however, proves the\r\nexperience of the second class to illustrate the most pervading need.\r\nThe world will have religion of some kind, even though it should fly\r\nfor it to the intellectual whoredom of 'spiritualism.' What is really\r\nwanted is the lifting power of an ideal element in human life.  But\r\nthe free play of this power must be preceded by its release from the\r\npractical materialism of the present, as well as from the torn\r\nswaddling bands of the past. It is now in danger of being stupefied by\r\nthe one, or strangled by the other.  I look, however, forward to a\r\ntime when the strength, insight, and elevation which now visit us in\r\nmere hints and glimpses, during moments 'of clearness and vigour,'\r\nshall be the stable and permanent possession of purer and mightier\r\nminds than ours--purer and mightier, partly because of their deeper\r\nknowledge of matter and their more faithful conformity to its laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXII.  FERMENTATION, & ITS BEARINGS ON SURGERY & MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A Discourse delivered before the Glasgow Science Lectures\r\nAssociation, October 19, 1876.]\r\n\r\nONE of the most remarkable characteristics of the age in which we\r\nlive, is its desire and tendency to connect itself organically with\r\npreceding ages--to ascertain how the state of things that now is came\r\nto be what it is.  And the more earnestly and profoundly this problem\r\nis studied, the more clearly comes into view the vast and varied debt\r\nwhich the world of to-day owes to that fore-world, in which man by\r\nskill, valour, and well-directed strength first replenished and\r\nsubdued the earth.  Our prehistoric fathers may have been savages, but\r\nthey were clever and observant ones.  They founded agriculture by the\r\ndiscovery and development of seeds whose origin is now unknown.  They\r\ntamed and harnessed their animal antagonists, and sent them down to us\r\nas ministers, instead of rivals in the fight for life.  Later on, when\r\nthe claims of luxury added themselves to those of necessity, we find\r\nthe same spirit of invention at work.  We have no historic account of\r\nthe first brewer, but we glean from history that his art was\r\npractised, and its produce relished, more than two thousand years ago.\r\nTheophrastus, who was born nearly four hundred years before Christ,\r\ndescribed beer as the wine of barley.  It is extremely difficult to\r\npreserve beer in a hot country, still, Egypt was the land in which it\r\nwas first brewed, the desire of man to quench his thirst with this\r\nexhilarating beverage overcoming all the obstacles which a hot climate\r\nthrew in the way of its manufacture.\r\n\r\nOur remote ancestors had also learned by experience that wine maketh\r\nglad the heart of man.  Noah, we are informed, planted a vineyard,\r\ndrank of the wine, and experienced the consequences.  But, though wine\r\nand beer possess so old a history, a very few years ago no man knew\r\nthe secret of their formation.  Indeed, it might be said that until\r\nthe present year no thorough and scientific account was ever given of\r\nthe agencies which come into play in the manufacture of beer, of the\r\nconditions necessary to its health, and of the maladies and\r\nvicissitudes to which it is subject.  Hitherto the art and practice of\r\nthe brewer have resembled those of the physician, both being founded\r\non empirical observation.  By this is meant the observation of facts,\r\napart from the principles which explain them, and which give the mind\r\nan intelligent mastery over them.  The brewer learnt from long\r\nexperience the conditions, not the reasons, of success.  But he had to\r\ncontend, and has still to contend, against unexplained perplexities.\r\nOver and over again his care has been rendered nugatory; his beer has\r\nfallen into acidity or rottenness, and disastrous losses have been\r\nsustained, of which he has been unable to assign the cause.  It is the\r\nhidden enemies against which the physician and the brewer have\r\nhitherto contended, that recent researches are dragging into the light\r\nof day, thus preparing the way for their final extermination.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLet us glance for a moment at the outward and visible signs of\r\nfermentation.  A few weeks ago I paid a visit to a private still in a\r\nSwiss chalet; and this is what I saw.  In the peasant's bedroom was a\r\ncask with a very large bunghole carefully closed.  The cask contained\r\ncherries which had lain in it for fourteen days.  It was not entirely\r\nfilled with the fruit, an air-space being left above the cherries when\r\nthey were put in.  I had the bung removed, and a small lamp dipped\r\ninto this space.  Its flame was instantly extinguished.  The oxygen of\r\nthe air had entirely disappeared, its place being taken by carbonic\r\nacid gas. [Footnote: The gas which is exhaled from the lungs after the\r\noxygen of the air has done its duty in purifying the blood, the same\r\nalso which effervesces from soda water and champagne.]  I tasted the\r\ncherries: they were very sour, though when put into the cask they were\r\nsweet.  The cherries and the liquid associated with them were then\r\nplaced in a copper boiler, to which a copper head was closely fitted.\r\nFrom the head proceeded a copper tube which passed straight through a\r\nvessel of cold water, and issued at the other side.  Under the open\r\nend of the tube was placed a bottle to receive the spirit distilled.\r\nThe flame of small wood-splinters being applied to the boiler, after a\r\ntime vapour rose into the head, passed through the tube, was condensed\r\nby the cold of the water, and fell in a liquid fillet into the bottle.\r\nOn being tasted, it proved to be that fiery and intoxicating spirit\r\nknown in commerce as Kirsch or Kirschwasser.\r\n\r\nThe cherries, it should be remembered, were left to themselves, no\r\nferment of any kind being added to them.  In this respect what has\r\nbeen said of the cherry applies also to the grape.  At the vintage the\r\nfruit of the vine is placed in proper vessels, and abandoned to its\r\nown action.  It ferments, producing carbonic acid; its sweetness\r\ndisappears, and at the end of a certain time the unintoxicating\r\ngrape-juice is converted into intoxicating wine.  Here, as in the case\r\nof the cherries, the fermentation is spontaneous--in what sense\r\nspontaneous will appear more clearly by-and-by.\r\n\r\nIt is needless for me to tell a Glasgow audience that the beer-brewer\r\ndoes not set to work in this way.  In the first place the brewer deals\r\nnot with the juice of fruits, but with the juice of barley.  The\r\nbarley having been steeped for a sufficient time in water, it is\r\ndrained and subjected to a temperature sufficient to cause the moist\r\ngrain to germinate; after which, it is completely dried upon a kiln.\r\nIt then receives the name of malt.  The malt is crisp to the teeth,\r\nand decidedly sweeter to the taste than the original barley.  It is\r\nground, mashed up in warm water, then boiled with hops until all the\r\nsoluble portions have been extracted; the infusion thus produced being\r\ncalled the wort.  This is drawn off, and cooled as rapidly as\r\npossible; then, instead of abandoning the infusion, as the wine-maker\r\ndoes, to its own action, the brewer mixes yeast with his wort, and\r\nplaces it in vessels each with only one aperture open to the air. Soon\r\nafter the addition of the yeast, a brownish froth, which is really new\r\nyeast, issues from the aperture, and falls like a cataract into\r\ntroughs prepared to receive it.  This frothing and foaming of the wort\r\nis a proof that the fermentation is active.\r\n\r\nWhence comes the yeast which issues so copiously from the fermenting\r\ntub?  What is this yeast, and how did the brewer become possessed of\r\nit?  Examine its quantity before and after fermentation.  The brewer\r\nintroduces, say 10 cwts. of yeast; he collects 40, or it may be 50,\r\ncwts.  The yeast has, therefore, augmented from four to five fold\r\nduring the fermentation.  Shall we conclude that this additional yeast\r\nhas been spontaneously generated by the wort?  Are we not rather\r\nreminded of that seed which fell into good ground, and brought forth\r\nfruit, some thirty fold, some sixty fold, some an hundred fold?  On\r\nexamination, this notion of organic growth turns out to be more than a\r\nmere surmise.  In the year 1680, when the microscope was still in its\r\ninfancy, Leeuwenhoek turned the instrument upon this substance, and\r\nfound it composed of minute globules suspended in a liquid.  Thus\r\nknowledge rested until 1835, when Cagniard de la Tour in France, and\r\nSchwann in Germany, independently, but animated by it common thought,\r\nturned microscopes of improved definition and heightened powers upon\r\nyeast, and found it budding and sprouting before their eyes.  The\r\naugmentation of the yeast alluded to above was thus proved to arise\r\nfrom the growth of a minute plant now called Torula (or Saccharomyces)\r\nCerevisiae.  Spontaneous generation is therefore out of the question.\r\nThe brewer deliberately sows the yeast-plant, which grows and\r\nmultiplies in the wort as its proper soil.  This discovery marks an\r\nepoch in the history of fermentation.\r\n\r\nBut where did the brewer find his yeast?  The reply to this question\r\nis similar to that which must be given if it were asked where the\r\nbrewer found his barley.  He has received the seeds of both of them\r\nfrom preceding generations.  Could we connect without solution of\r\ncontinuity the present with the past, we should probably be able to\r\ntrace back the yeast employed by my friend Sir Fowell Buxton to-day to\r\nthat employed by some Egyptian brewer two thousand years ago.  But you\r\nmay urge that there must have been a time when the first yeast-cell\r\nwas generated.  Granted--exactly as there was a time when the first\r\nbarley-corn was generated.  Let not the delusion lay hold of you that\r\na living thing is easily generated because it is small.  Both the\r\nyeast-plant and the barley-plant lose themselves in the dim twilight\r\nof antiquity, and in this our day there is no more proof of the\r\nspontaneous generation of the one, than there is of the spontaneous\r\ngeneration of the other.\r\n\r\nI stated a moment ago that the fermentation of grape-juice was\r\nspontaneous; but I was careful to add, in what sense spontaneous will\r\nappear more clearly by-and-by.' Now this is the sense meant.  The\r\nwine-maker does not, like the brewer and distiller, deliberately\r\nintroduce either yeast; or any equivalent of yeast, into his vats; he\r\ndoes not consciously sow in them any plant, or the germ of any plant;\r\nindeed, he has been hitherto in ignorance whether plants or germs of\r\nany kind have had anything to do with his operations.  Still, when the\r\nfermented grape-juice is examined, the living Torula concerned in\r\nalcoholic fermentation never fails to make its appearance.  How is\r\nthis?  If no living germ has been introduced into the wine-vat, whence\r\ncomes the life so invariably developed there?\r\n\r\nYou may be disposed to reply, with Turpin and others, that in virtue\r\nof its own inherent powers, the grape-juice when brought into contact\r\nwith the vivifying atmospheric oxygen, runs spontaneously and of its\r\nown accord into these low forms of life.  I have not the slightest\r\nobjection to this explanation, provided proper evidence can be adduced\r\nin support of it.  But the evidence adduced in its favour, as far as I\r\nam acquainted with it, snaps asunder under the strain of scientific\r\ncriticism.  It is, as far as I can see, the evidence of men, who\r\nhowever keen and clever as observers, are not rigidly trained\r\nexperimenters.  These alone are aware of the precautions necessary in\r\ninvestigations of this delicate kind.  In reference, then, to the life\r\nof the wine-vat, what is the decision of experiment when carried out\r\nby competent men?  Let a quantity of the clear, filtered 'must' of the\r\ngrape be so boiled as to destroy such germs as it may have contracted\r\nfrom the air or otherwise.  In contact with germless air the\r\nuncontaminated must never ferments.  All the materials for spontaneous\r\ngeneration are there, but so long as there is no seed sown, there is\r\nno life developed, and no sign of that fermentation which is the\r\nconcomitant of life.  Nor need you resort to a boiled liquid.  The\r\ngrape is sealed by its own skin against contamination from without. By\r\nan ingenious device Pasteur has extracted from the interior of the\r\ngrape its pure juice, and proved that in contact with pure air it\r\nnever acquires the power to ferment itself, nor to produce\r\nfermentation in other liquids. [Footnote: The liquids of the healthy\r\nanimal body are also sealed from external contamination.  Pure blood,\r\nfor example, drawn with due precautions from the veins, will never\r\nferment or putrefy in contact with pure air.]  It is not, therefore,\r\nin the interior of the grape that the origin of the life observed in\r\nthe vat is to be sought.\r\n\r\nWhat then is its true origin?  This is Pasteur's answer, which his\r\nwell-proved accuracy renders worthy of all confidence.  At the time of\r\nthe vintage microscopic particles are observed adherent, both to the\r\nouter surface of the grape and of the twigs which support the grape.\r\nBrush these particles into a capsule of pure water.  It is rendered\r\nturbid by the dust. Examined by a microscope, some of these minute\r\nparticles are seen to present the appearance of organised--cells.\r\nInstead of receiving them in water, let them be brushed into the pure\r\ninert juice of the grape.  Forty-eight hours after this is done, our\r\nfamiliar Torula is observed budding and sprouting, the growth of the\r\nplant being accompanied by all the other signs of active fermentation.\r\nWhat is the inference to be drawn from this experiment?  Obviously\r\nthat the particles adherent to the external surface of the grape\r\ninclude the germs of that life which, after they have been sown in the\r\njuice, appears in such profusion.  Wine is sometimes objected to on\r\nthe ground that fermentation is 'artificial;' but we notice here the\r\nresponsibility of nature.  The ferment of the grape clings like a\r\nparasite to the surface of the grape; and the art of the wine-maker\r\nfrom time immemorial has consisted in bringing--and it may be added,\r\nignorantly bringing--two things thus closely associated by nature into\r\nactual contact with each other.  For thousands of years, what has been\r\ndone consciously by the brewer, has been done unconsciously by the\r\nwine-grower.  The one has sown his leaven just as much as the other.\r\n\r\nNor is it necessary to impregnate the beer-wort with yeast to provoke\r\nfermentation.  Abandoned to the contact of our common air, it sooner\r\nor later ferments; but the chances are that the produce of that\r\nfermentation, instead of being agreeable, would be disgusting to the\r\ntaste.  By a rare accident we might get the true alcoholic\r\nfermentation, but the odds against obtaining it would be enormous.\r\nPure air acting upon a lifeless liquid will never provoke\r\nfermentation; but our ordinary air is the vehicle of numberless germs\r\nwhich act as ferments when they fall into appropriate infusions.  Some\r\nof them produce acidity, some putrefaction.  The germs of our\r\nyeast-plant are also in the air; but so sparingly distributed that an\r\ninfusion like beer-wort, exposed to the air, is almost sure to be\r\ntaken possession of by foreign organisms.  In fact, the maladies of\r\nbeer are wholly due to the admixture of these objectionable ferments,\r\nwhose forms and modes of nutrition differ materially from those of the\r\ntrue leaven.\r\n\r\nWorking in an atmosphere charged with the germs of these organisms,\r\nyou can understand how easy it is to fall into error in studying the\r\naction of any one of them.  Indeed it is only the most accomplished\r\nexperimenter, who, moreover, avails himself of every means of\r\nchecking his conclusions, that can walk without tripping through this\r\nland of pitfalls.  Such a man the French chemist Pasteur has hitherto\r\nproved himself to be.  He has taught us how to separate the commingled\r\nferments of our air, and to study their pure individual action. Guided\r\nby him, let us fix our attention more particularly upon the growth and\r\naction of the true yeast-plant under different conditions. Let it be\r\nsown in a fermentable liquid, which is supplied with plenty of pure\r\nair.  The plant will flourish in the aerated infusion, and produce\r\nlarge quantities of carbonic acid gas--a compound, as you know, of\r\ncarbon and oxygen.  The oxygen thus consumed by the plant is the free\r\noxygen of the air, which we suppose to be abundantly supplied to the\r\nliquid.  The action is so far similar to the respiration of animals,\r\nwhich inspire oxygen and expire carbonic acid.  If we examine the\r\nliquid even when the vigour of the plant has reached its maximum, we\r\nhardly find in it a trace of alcohol.  The yeast has grown and\r\nflourished, but it has almost ceased to act as a ferment.  And could\r\nevery individual yeast-cell seize, without any impediment, free oxygen\r\nfrom the surrounding liquid, it is certain that it would cease to act\r\nas a ferment altogether.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the conditions under which the yeast-plant must be\r\nplaced so that it may display its characteristic quality?  Reflection\r\non the facts already referred to suggests a reply, and rigid\r\nexperiment confirms the suggestion.  Consider the Alpine cherries in\r\ntheir closed vessel.  Consider the beer in its barrel, with a single\r\nsmall aperture open to the air, through which it is observed not to\r\nimbibe oxygen, but to pour forth carbonic acid.  Whence come the\r\nvolumes of oxygen necessary to the production of this latter gas?  The\r\nsmall quantity of atmospheric air dissolved in the wort and overlying\r\nit would be totally incompetent to supply the necessary oxygen.  In no\r\nother way can the yeast-plant obtain the gas necessary for its\r\nrespiration than by wrenching it from surrounding substances in which\r\nthe oxygen exists, not free, but in a state of combination.  It\r\ndecomposes the sugar of the solution in which it grows, produces heat,\r\nbreathes forth carbonic acid gas, and one of the liquid products of\r\nthe decomposition is our familiar alcohol.  The act of fermentation,\r\nthen, is a result of the effort of the little plant to maintain its\r\nrespiration by means of combined oxygen, when its supply of free\r\noxygen is cut off.  As defined by Pasteur, fermentation is life\r\nwithout air.\r\n\r\nBut here the knowledge of that thorough investigator comes to our aid\r\nto warn us against errors which have 'been committed over and over\r\nagain.  It is not all yeast-cells that can thus live without air and\r\nprovoke fermentation.  They must be young cells which have caught\r\ntheir vegetative vigour from contact with free oxygen.  But once\r\npossessed of this vigour the yeast may be transplanted into a\r\nsaccharine infusion absolutely purged of air, where it will continue\r\nto live at the expense of the oxygen, carbon, and other constituents\r\nof the infusion.  Under these new conditions its life, as a plant,\r\nwill be by no means so vigorous as when it had a supply of free\r\noxygen, but its action as a ferment will be indefinitely greater.\r\n\r\nDoes the yeast-plant stand alone in its power of provoking alcoholic\r\nfermentation?  It would be singular if amid the multitude of low\r\nvegetable forms no other could be found capable of acting in a similar\r\nway.  And here again we have occasion to marvel at that sagacity of\r\nobservation among the ancients to which we owe so vast a debt.  Not\r\nonly did they discover the alcoholic ferment of yeast, but they had to\r\nexercise a wise selection in picking it out from others, and giving it\r\nspecial prominence.  Place an old boot in a moist place, or expose\r\ncommon paste or a pot of jam to the air; it soon becomes coated with a\r\nblue-green mould, which is nothing else than the fructification of a\r\nlittle plant called Penicillium glaucum.  Do not imagine that the\r\nmould has sprung spontaneously from boot, or paste, or jam; its germs,\r\nwhich are abundant in the air, have been sown, and have germinated, in\r\nas legal and legitimate a way as thistle-seeds wafted by the wind to a\r\nproper soil.  Let the minute spores of Penicillium be sown in a\r\nfermentable liquid, which has been previously so boiled as to kill all\r\nother spores or seeds which it may contain; let pure air have free\r\naccess to the mixture; the Penicillium will grow rapidly, striking\r\nlong filaments into the liquid, and fructifying at its surface.  Test\r\nthe infusion at various stages of the plant's growth, you will never\r\nfind in it a trace of alcohol.  But forcibly submerge the little\r\nplant, push it down deep into the liquid, where the quantity of free\r\noxygen that can reach it is insufficient for its needs, it immediately\r\nbegins to act as a ferment, supplying itself with oxygen by the\r\ndecomposition of the sugar, and producing alcohol as one of the\r\nresults of the decomposition.  Many other low microscopic plants act\r\nin a similar manner.  In aerated liquids they flourish without any\r\nproduction of alcohol, but cut off from free oxygen they act as\r\nferments, producing alcohol exactly as the real alcoholic leaven\r\nproduces it, only less copiously.  For the right apprehension of all\r\nthese facts we are indebted to Pasteur.\r\n\r\nIn the cases hitherto considered, the fermentation is proved to be the\r\ninvariable correlative of life, being produced by organisms foreign to\r\nthe fermentable substance.  But the substance itself may also have\r\nwithin it, to some extent, the motive power of fermentation.  The\r\nyeast-plant, as we have learned, is an assemblage of living cells; but\r\nso at bottom, as shown by Schleiden and Schwann, are all living\r\norganisms.  Cherries, apples, peaches, pears, plums, and grapes, for\r\nexample, are composed of cells, each of which is a living unit.  And\r\nhere I have to direct your attention to a point of extreme interest.\r\nIn 1821, the celebrated French chemist, Bérard, established the\r\nimportant fact that all ripening fruit, exposed to the free\r\natmosphere, absorbed the oxygen of the atmosphere and liberated an\r\napproximately equal volume of carbonic acid.  He also found that when\r\nripe fruits were placed in a confined atmosphere, the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere was first absorbed, and an equal volume of carbonic acid\r\ngiven out.  But the process did not end here.  After the oxygen had\r\nvanished, carbonic acid, in considerable quantities, continued to be\r\nexhaled by the fruits, which at the same time lost a portion of their\r\nsugar, becoming more acid to the taste, though the absolute quantity\r\nof acid was not augmented.  This was an observation of capital\r\nimportance, and Bérard had the sagacity to remark that the process\r\nmight be regarded as a kind of fermentation.\r\n\r\nThus the living cells of fruits can absorb oxygen and breathe out\r\ncarbonic acid, exactly like the living cells of the leaven of beer.\r\nSupposing the access of oxygen suddenly cut off, will the living\r\nfruit-cells as suddenly die, or will they continue to live as yeast\r\nlives, by extracting oxygen from the saccharine juices round them?\r\nThis is a question of extreme theoretic significance.  It was first\r\nanswered affirmatively by the able and conclusive experiments of\r\nLechartier and Bellamy, and the answer was subsequently confirmed and\r\nexplained by the experiments and the reasoning of Pasteur.  Bérard\r\nonly showed the absorption of oxygen and the production of carbonic\r\nacid; Lechartier and Bellamy proved the production of alcohol, thus\r\ncompleting the evidence that it was a case of real fermentation,\r\nthough the common alcoholic ferment was absent.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nSo full was Pasteur of the idea that the cells of a fruit would\r\ncontinue to live at the expense of the sugar of the fruit, that once\r\nin his laboratory, while conversing on these subjects with M. Dumas,\r\nhe exclaimed, 'I will wager that if a grape be plunged into an\r\natmosphere of carbonic acid, it will produce alcohol and carbonic acid\r\nby the continued life of its own cells--that they will act for a time\r\nlike the cells of the true alcoholic leaven.' He made the experiment,\r\nand found the result to be what he had foreseen.  He then extended the\r\n'enquiry.  Placing under a bell-jar twenty-four plums, he filled the\r\njar with carbonic acid gas; beside it he placed twenty-four similar\r\nplums uncovered.  At the end of eight days, he removed the plums from\r\nthe jar, and compared them with the others.  The difference was\r\nextraordinary.  The uncovered fruits had become soft, watery, and very\r\nsweet; the others were firm and hard, their fleshy portions being not\r\nat all watery.  They had, moreover, lost a considerable quantity of\r\ntheir sugar.  They were afterwards bruised, and the juice was\r\ndistilled.  It yielded six and a half grammes of alcohol, or one per\r\ncent.  of the total weight of the plums.  Neither in these plums, nor\r\nin the grapes first experimented on by Pasteur, could any trace of the\r\nordinary alcoholic leaven be found.  As previously proved by\r\nLechartier and Bellamy, the fermentation was the work of the living\r\ncells of the fruit itself, after air had been denied to them.  When,\r\nmoreover, the cells were destroyed by bruising, no fermentation\r\nensued.  The fermentation was the correlative of a vital act, and it\r\nceased when life was extinguished.\r\n\r\nLuedersdorf was the first to show by this method that yeast acted,\r\nnot, as Liebig had assumed, in virtue of its organic, but in virtue of\r\nits organised character.  He destroyed the cells of yeast by rubbing\r\nthem on a ground glass plate, and found that with the destruction of\r\nthe organism, though its chemical constituents remained, the power to\r\nact as a ferment totally disappeared.\r\n\r\nOne word more in reference to Liebig may find a place here.  To the\r\nphilosophic chemist thoughtfully pondering these phenomena, familiar\r\nwith the conception of molecular motion, and the changes produced by\r\nthe interactions of purely chemical forces, nothing could be more\r\nnatural than to see in the process of fermentation a simple\r\nillustration of molecular instability, the ferment propagating to\r\nsurrounding molecular groups the overthrow of its own tottering\r\ncombinations.  Broadly considered, indeed, there is a certain amount\r\nof truth in this theory; but Liebig, who propounded it, missed the\r\nvery kernel of the phenomena when he overlooked or contemned the part\r\nplayed in fermentation by microscopic life.  He looked at the matter\r\ntoo little with the eye of the body, and too much with the spiritual\r\neye.  He practically neglected the microscope, and was unmoved by the\r\nknowledge which its revelations would have poured in upon his mind.\r\nHis hypothesis, as I have said, was natural--nay it was a striking\r\nillustration of Liebig's power to penetrate and unveil molecular\r\nactions; but it was an error, and as such has proved an ignis fatuus\r\ninstead of a pharos to some of his followers.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI have said that our air is full of the germs of ferments differing\r\nfrom the alcoholic leaven, and sometimes seriously interfering with\r\nthe latter.  They are the weeds of this microscopic garden which often\r\novershadow and choke the flowers.  Let us take an illustrative case.\r\nExpose milk to the air.  It will, after a time, turn sour, separating\r\nlike blood into clot and serum.  Place a drop of this sour milk under\r\na powerful microscope and watch it closely.  You see the minute\r\nbutter-globules animated by that curious quivering motion called the\r\nBrownian motion.  But let not this attract your attention too much,\r\nfor it is another motion that we have now to seek.  Here and there you\r\nobserve a greater disturbance than ordinary among the globules; keep\r\nyour eye upon the place of tumult, and you will probably see emerging\r\nfrom it a long eel-like organism, tossing the globules aside and\r\nwriggling more or less rapidly across the field of the microscope.\r\nFamiliar with one sample of this organism, which from its motions\r\nreceives the name of vibrio, you soon detect numbers of them.  It is\r\nthese organisms, and other analogous though apparently motionless\r\nones, which by decomposing the milk render it sour and putrid.  They\r\nare the lactic and putrid ferments, as the yeast-plant is the\r\nalcoholic ferment of sugar.  Keep them and their germs out of your\r\nmilk and it will continue sweet.  But milk may become putrid without\r\nbecoming sour.  Examine such putrid milk microscopically, and you find\r\nit swarming with shorter organisms, sometimes associated with the\r\nvibrios, sometimes alone, and often manifesting a wonderful alacrity\r\nof motion.  Keep these organisms and their germs out of your milk and\r\nit will never putrify.  Expose a mutton-chop to the air and keep it\r\nmoist; in summer weather it soon stinks.  Place a drop of the juice of\r\nthe fetid chop under a powerful microscope; it is seen swarming with\r\norganisms resembling those in the putrid milk.  These organisms, which\r\nreceive the common name of bacteria, [Footnote: Doubtless organisms\r\nexhibiting grave specific differences are grouped together under this\r\ncommon name.] are the agents of all putrefaction.  Keep them and their\r\ngerms from your meat and it will remain for ever sweet.  Thus we begin\r\nto see that within the world of life to which we ourselves belong,\r\nthere is another living world requiring the microscope for its\r\ndiscernment, but which, nevertheless, has the most important bearing\r\non the welfare of the higher life-world.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us reason together as regards the origin of these\r\nbacteria.  A granular powder is placed in your hands, and you are\r\nasked to state what it is.  You examine it, and have, or have not,\r\nreason to suspect that seeds of some kind are mixed up in it.  To\r\ndetermine this point you prepare a bed in your garden, sow in it the\r\npowder, and soon after find a mixed crop of docks and thistles\r\nsprouting from your bed.  Until this powder was sown neither docks nor\r\nthistles ever made their appearance in your garden.  You repeat the\r\nexperiment once, twice, ten times, fifty times.  From fifty different\r\nbeds after the sowing of the powder, you obtain the same crop.  What\r\nwill be your response to the question proposed to you?  'I am not in a\r\ncondition,' you would say, 'to affirm that every grain of the powder\r\nis a dock-seed, or a thistle-seed; but I am in a condition to affirm\r\nthat both dock and thistle-seeds form, at all events, part of the\r\npowder.' Supposing a succession of such powders to be placed in your\r\nhands with grains becoming gradually smaller, until they dwindle to\r\nthe size of impalpable dust particles; assuming that you treat them\r\nall in the same way, and that from every one of them in a few days you\r\nobtain a definite crop--may be clover, it may be mustard, it may be\r\nmignonette, it may be a plant more minute than any of these, smallness\r\nof the particles, or of the plants that spring from them, does not\r\naffect the validity of the conclusion.  Without a shadow of misgiving\r\nyou would conclude that the powder must have contained the seeds or\r\ngerms of the life observed.  There is not in the range of physical\r\nscience, an experiment more conclusive nor an inference safer than\r\nthis one.\r\n\r\nSupposing the powder to be light enough to float in the air, and that\r\nyou are enabled to see it there just as plainly as you saw the heavier\r\npowder in the palm of hand.  If the dust sown by the air instead of by\r\nthe hand produce a definite living crop, with the same logical rigour\r\nyou would conclude that the germs of this crop must be mixed with the\r\ndust. To take an illustration: the spores of the little plant\r\nPenicillium glaucum, to which I have already referred, are light\r\nenough to float in the air.  A cut apple, a pear, a tomato, a slice of\r\nvegetable marrow, or, as already mentioned, an old moist boot, a dish\r\nof paste, or a pot of jam, constitutes a proper soil for the\r\nPenicillium.  Now, if it could be proved that the dust of the air when\r\nsown in this soil produces this plant, while, wanting the dust,\r\nneither the air, nor the soil, nor both together can produce it, it\r\nwould be obviously just as certain in this case that the floating dust\r\ncontains the germs of Penicillium as that the powders sown in your\r\ngarden contained the germs of the plants which sprung from them.\r\n\r\nBut how is the floating dust to be rendered visible?  In this way.\r\nBuild a little chamber and provide it with a door, windows, and\r\nwindow-shutters.  Let an aperture be made in one of the shutters\r\nthrough which a sunbeam can pass.  Close the door and windows so that\r\nno light shall enter save through the hole in the shutter.  The track\r\nof the sunbeam is at first perfectly plain and vivid in the air of the\r\nroom.  If all disturbance of the air of the chamber be avoided, the\r\nluminous track will become fainter and fainter, until at last it\r\ndisappears absolutely, and no trace of the beam is to be seen.  What\r\nrendered the beam visible at first?  The floating dust of the air,\r\nwhich, thus illuminated and observed, is as palpable to sense as dust\r\nor powder placed on the palm of the hand.  In the still air the dust\r\ngradually sinks to the floor or sticks to the walls and ceiling, until\r\nfinally, by this self-cleansing process, the air is entirely freed\r\nfrom mechanically suspended matter.\r\n\r\nThus, far, I think, we have made our footing sure.  Let us proceed.\r\nChop up a beefsteak and allow it to remain for two or three hours just\r\ncovered with warm water; you thus extract the juice of the beef in a\r\nconcentrated form.  By properly boiling the liquid and filtering it,\r\nyou can obtain from it a perfectly transparent beef-tea.  Expose a\r\nnumber of vessels containing this tea to the moteless air of your\r\nchamber; and expose a number of vessels containing precisely the same\r\nliquid to the dust-laden air.  In three days every one of the latter\r\nstinks, and examined with the microscope every one of them is found\r\nswarming with the bacteria of putrefaction.  After three months, or\r\nthree years, the beef-tea within the chamber is found in every case as\r\nsweet and clear, and as free from bacteria, as it was at the moment\r\nwhen it was first put in.  There is absolutely no difference between\r\nthe air within and that without save that the one is dustless and the\r\nother dust-laden.\r\n\r\nClinch the experiment thus: Open the door of your chamber and allow\r\nthe dust to enter it.  In three days afterwards you have every vessel\r\nwithin the chamber swarming with bacteria, and in a state of active\r\nputrefaction.  Here, also, the inference is quite as certain as in the\r\ncase of the powder sown in your garden.  Multiply your proofs by\r\nbuilding fifty chambers instead of one, and by employing every\r\nimaginable infusion of wild animals and tame; of flesh, fish, fowl,\r\nand viscera; of vegetables of the most various kinds.  If in all these\r\ncases you find the dust infallibly producing its crop of bacteria,\r\nwhile neither the dustless air nor the nutritive infusion, nor both\r\ntogether, are ever able to produce this crop, your conclusion is\r\nsimply irresistible that the dust of the air contains the germs of the\r\ncrop which has appeared in your infusions.  I repeat there is no\r\ninference of experimental science more certain than this one.  In the\r\npresence of such facts, to use the words of a paper lately published\r\nin the 'Philosophical Transactions,' it would be simply monstrous to\r\naffirm that these swarming crops of bacteria are spontaneously\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\nIs there then no experimental proof of spontaneous generation?  I\r\nanswer without hesitation, none!  But to doubt the experimental proof\r\nof a fact, and to deny its possibility, are two different things,\r\nthough some writers confuse matters by making them synonymous.  In\r\nfact, this doctrine of spontaneous generation, in one form or another,\r\nfalls in with the theoretic beliefs of some of the foremost workers of\r\nthis age; but it is exactly these men who have the penetration to see,\r\nand the honesty to expose, the weakness of the evidence adduced in its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAnd here observe how these discoveries tally with the common practices\r\nof life.  Heat kills the bacteria, colds numbs them.  When my\r\nhousekeeper has pheasants in charge which she wishes to keep sweet,\r\nbut which threaten to give way, she partially cooks the birds, kills\r\nthe infant bacteria, and thus postpones the evil day.  By boiling her\r\nmilk she also extends its period of sweetness.  Some weeks ago in the\r\nAlps I made a few experiments on the influence of cold upon ants.\r\nThough the sun was strong, patches of snow still maintained themselves\r\non the mountain slopes.  The ants were found in the warm grass and on\r\nthe warm rocks adjacent.  Transferred to the snow the rapidity of\r\ntheir paralysis was surprising.  Ina few seconds a vigorous ant, after\r\na few languid struggles, would wholly lose its power of locomotion and\r\nlie practically dead upon the snow.  Transferred to the warm rock, it\r\nwould revive, to be again smitten with death-like numbness when\r\nretransferred to the snow.  What is true of the ant is specially true\r\nof our bacteria.  Their active life is suspended by cold, and with it\r\ntheir power of producing or continuing putrefaction.  This is the\r\nwhole philosophy of the preservation of meat by cold.  The fishmonger,\r\nfor example, when he surrounds his very assailable wares by lumps of\r\nice, stays the process of putrefaction by reducing to numbness and\r\ninaction the organisms which produce it, and in the absence of which\r\nhis fish would remain sweet and sound.  It is the astonishing activity\r\ninto which these bacteria are pushed by warmth that renders a single\r\nsummer's day sometimes so disastrous to the great butchers of London\r\nand Glasgow.  The bodies of guides lost in the crevasses of Alpine\r\nglaciers have come to the surface forty years after their interment,\r\nwithout the flesh showing any sign of putrefaction.  But the most\r\nastonishing case of this kind is that of the hairy elephant of Siberia\r\nwhich was found incased in ice.  It had been buried for ages, but when\r\nlaid bare its flesh was sweet, and for some time afforded copious\r\nnutriment to the wild beasts which fed upon it.\r\n\r\nBeer is assailable by all the organisms here referred to, some of\r\nwhich produce acetic, some lactic, and some butyric acid, while yeast\r\nis open to attack from the bacteria of putrefaction.  In relation to\r\nthe particular beverage the brewer wishes to produce, these foreign\r\nferments have been properly called ferments of disease.  The cells of\r\nthe true leaven are globules, usually somewhat elongated.  The other\r\norganisms are more or less rod-like or eel-like in shape, some of them\r\nbeing beaded so as to resemble necklaces.  Each of these organisms\r\nproduces a fermentation and a flavour peculiar to itself.  Keep them\r\nout of your beer and it remains for ever unaltered.  Never without\r\nthem will your beer contract disease.  But their germs are in the air,\r\nin the vessels employed in the brewery; even in the yeast used to\r\nimpregnate the wort.  Consciously or unconsciously, the art of the\r\nbrewer is directed against them.  His aim is to paralyze, if he cannot\r\nannihilate them.\r\n\r\nFor beer, moreover, the question of temperature is one of supreme\r\nimportance; indeed, the recognised influence of temperature is causing\r\non the continent of Europe a complete revolution in the manufacture of\r\nbeer.  When I was a student in Berlin, in 1851, there were certain\r\nplaces specially devoted to the sale of Bavarian beer, which was then\r\nmaking its way into public favour.  This beer is prepared by what is\r\ncalled the process of low fermentation; the name being given partly\r\nbecause the yeast of the beer, instead of rising to the top and\r\nissuing through the bunghole, falls to the bottom of the cask; but\r\npartly, also, because it is produced at a low temperature.  The other\r\nand older process, called high fermentation, is far more handy,\r\nexpeditious, and cheap.  In high fermentation eight days suffice for\r\nthe production of the beer; in low fermentation, ten, fifteen, even\r\ntwenty days are found necessary.  Vast quantities of ice, moreover,\r\nare consumed in the process of low fermentation.  In the single\r\nbrewery of Dreher, of Vienna, a hundred million pounds of ice are\r\nconsumed annually in cooling the wort and beer.  Notwithstanding these\r\nobvious and weighty drawbacks, the low fermentation is rapidly\r\ndisplacing the high upon the Continent.  Here are some statistics\r\nwhich show the number of breweries of both kinds existing in Bohemia\r\nin 1860, 1865, and 1870:\r\n\r\n                    1860.    1865.    1870.\r\n\r\nHigh Fermentation    281      81       18\r\n\r\nLow Fermentation     135     459      831\r\n\r\nThus in ten years the number of high-fermentation breweries fell from\r\n281 to 18, while the number of low-fermentation breweries rose from\r\n135 to 831.  The sole reason for this vast change--a change which\r\ninvolves a great expenditure of time, labour, and money--is the\r\nadditional command which it gives the brewer over the fortuitous\r\nferments of disease.  These ferments, which, it is to be remembered,\r\nare living organisms, have their activity suspended by temperatures\r\nbelow 10°C, and as long as they are reduced to torpor the beer remains\r\nuntainted either by acidity or putrefaction.  The beer of low\r\nfermentation is brewed in winter, and kept in cool cellars; the brewer\r\nbeing thus enabled to dispose of it at his leisure, instead of forcing\r\nits consumption to avoid the loss involved in its alteration if kept\r\ntoo long.  Hops, it may be remarked, act to some extent as an\r\nantiseptic to beer.  The essential oil of the hop is bactericidal:\r\nhence the strong impregnation with hop juice of all beer intended for\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\nThese low organisms, which one might be disposed to regard as the\r\nbeginnings of life, were we not warned that the microscope, precious\r\nand perfect as it is, has no power to show us the real beginnings of\r\nlife, are by no means purely useless or purely mischievous in the\r\neconomy of nature.  They are only noxious when out of their proper\r\nplace.  They exercise a useful and valuable function as the burners\r\nand consumers of dead matter, animal and vegetable, reducing such\r\nmatter, with a rapidity otherwise unattainable, to innocent carbonic\r\nacid and water.  Furthermore, they are not all alike, and it is only\r\nrestricted classes of them that are really dangerous to man.  One\r\ndifference in their habits is worthy of special reference here.  Air,\r\nor rather the oxygen of the air, which is absolutely necessary to the\r\nsupport of the bacteria of putrefaction, is, according to Pasteur,\r\nabsolutely deadly to the vibrios which provoke the butyric acid\r\nfermentation.  This has been illustrated by the following beautiful\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nA drop of the liquid containing those small organisms is placed upon\r\nglass, and on the drop is placed a circle of exceedingly thin glass;\r\nfor, to magnify them sufficiently, it is necessary that the\r\nobject-glass of the microscope should come very close to the\r\norganisms.  Round the edge of the circular plate of glass the liquid\r\nis in contact with the air, and incessantly absorbs it, including the\r\noxygen.  Here, if the drop be charged with bacteria, we have a zone of\r\nvery lively ones.  But through this living zone, greedy of oxygen and\r\nappropriating it, the vivifying gas cannot penetrate to the centre of\r\nthe film.  In the middle, therefore, the bacteria die, while their\r\nperipheral colleagues continue active.  If a bubble of air chance to\r\nbe enclosed in the film, round it the bacteria will pirouette and\r\nwabble until its oxygen has been absorbed, after which all their\r\nmotions cease.  Precisely the reverse of all this occurs with the\r\nvibrios of butyric acid.  In their case it is the peripheral organisms\r\nthat are first killed, the central ones remaining vigorous while\r\nringed by a zone of dead.  Pasteur, moreover, filled two vessels with\r\na liquid containing these vibrios; through one vessel be led air, and\r\nkilled its vibrios in half an hour; through the other he led carbonic\r\nacid, and after three hours found the vibrios fully active.  It was\r\nwhile observing these differences of deportment fifteen years ago that\r\nthe thought of life without air, and its bearing upon the theory of\r\nfermentation, flashed upon the mind of this admirable investigator.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWe now approach an aspect of this question which concerns us still\r\nmore closely, and will be best illustrated by an actual fact.  A few\r\nyears ago I was bathing in an Alpine stream, and returning to my\r\nclothes from the cascade which had been my shower-bath, I slipped upon\r\na block of granite, the sharp crystals of which stamped themselves\r\ninto my naked shin.  The wound was an awkward one, but being in\r\nvigorous health at the time, I hoped for a speedy recovery.  Dipping a\r\nclean pocket-handkerchief into the stream, I wrapped it round the\r\nwound, limped home, and remained for four or five days quietly in bed.\r\nThere was no pain, and at the end of this time I thought myself quite\r\nfit to quit my room.  The wound, when uncovered, was found perfectly\r\nclean, uninflamed, and entirely free from matter.  Placing over it a\r\nbit of goldbeater's-skin, I walked about all day.  Towards evening\r\nitching and heat were felt; a large accumulation of matter followed,\r\nand I was forced to go to bed again.  The water-bandage was restored,\r\nbut it was powerless to check the action now set up; arnica was\r\napplied, but it made matters worse.  The inflammation increased\r\nalarmingly, until finally I had to be carried on men's shoulders down\r\nthe mountain and transported to Geneva, where, thanks to the kindness\r\nof friends, I was immediately placed in the best medical hands.  On\r\nthe morning after my arrival in Geneva, Dr. Gautier discovered an\r\nabscess in my instep, at a distance of five inches from the wound. The\r\ntwo were connected by a channel, or sinus, as it is technically\r\ncalled, through which he was able to empty the abscess, without the\r\napplication of the lance.\r\n\r\nBy what agency was that channel formed--what was it that thus tore\r\nasunder the sound tissue of my instep, and kept me for six weeks a\r\nprisoner in bed?  In the very room where the water dressing had been\r\nremoved from my wound and the goldbeater's-skin applied to it, I\r\nopened this year a number of tubes, containing perfectly clear and\r\nsweet infusions of fish, flesh, and vegetable.  These hermetically\r\nsealed infusions had been exposed for weeks, both to the sun of the\r\nAlps and to the warmth of a kitchen, without showing the slightest\r\nturbidity or sign of life.  But two days after they were opened the\r\ngreater number of them swarmed with the bacteria of putrefaction, the\r\ngerms of which had been contracted from the dust-laden air of the\r\nroom.  And had the matter from my abscess been examined, my memory of\r\nits appearance leads me to infer that it would have been found equally\r\nswarming with these bacteria--that it was their germs which got into\r\nmy incautiously opened wound, and that they were the subtile workers\r\nthat burrowed down my shin, dug the abscess in my instep, and produced\r\neffects which might easily have proved fatal.\r\n\r\nThis apparent digression brings us face to face with the labours of a\r\nman who combines the penetration of the true theorist with the skill\r\nand conscientiousness of the true experimenter, and whose practice is\r\none continued demonstration of the theory that the putrefaction of\r\nwounds is to be averted by the destruction of the germs of bacteria.\r\nNot only from his own reports of his cases, but from the reports of\r\neminent men who have visited his hospital, and from the opinions\r\nexpressed to me by continental surgeons, do I gather that one of the\r\ngreatest steps ever made in the art of surgery was the introduction of\r\nthe antiseptic system of treatment, introduced by Professor Lister.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this subject does not slacken as we proceed.  We began\r\nwith the cherry-cask and beer-vat; we end with the body of man.  There\r\nare persons born with the power of interpreting natural facts, as\r\nthere are others smitten with everlasting incompetence in regard to\r\nsuch interpretation.  To the former class in an eminent degree\r\nbelonged the illustrious philosopher Robert Boyle, whose words in\r\nrelation to this subject have in them the forecast of prophecy.  'And\r\nlet me add,' writes Boyle in his 'Essay on the Pathological Part of\r\nPhysic,' 'that he that thoroughly understands the nature of ferments\r\nand fermentations shall probably be much better able than he that\r\nignores them, to give a fair account of divers phenomena of several\r\ndiseases (as well fevers as others), which will perhaps be never\r\nproperly understood without an insight into the doctrine of\r\nfermentations.'\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years have passed since these pregnant words were written,\r\nand it is only in this our day that men are beginning to fully realise\r\ntheir truth.  In the domain of surgery the justice of Boyle's surmise\r\nhas been most strictly demonstrated.  But we now pass the bounds of\r\nsurgery proper, and enter the domain of epidemic disease, including\r\nthose fevers so sagaciously referred to by Boyle.  The most striking\r\nanalogy between a _contagium_ and a ferment is to be found in the power\r\nof indefinite self-multiplication possessed and exercised by both. You\r\nknow the exquisitely truthful figures regarding leaven employed in the\r\nNew Testament.  A particle hid in three measures of meal leavens it\r\nall.  A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.  In a similar manner,\r\na particle of _contagium_ spreads through the human body and may be so\r\nmultiplied as to strike down whole populations.  Consider the effect\r\nproduced upon the system by a microscopic quantity of the virus of\r\nsmallpox.  That virus is, to all intents and purposes, a seed.  It is\r\nsown as yeast is sown, it grows and multiplies as yeast grows and\r\nmultiplies, and it always reproduces itself.  To Pasteur we are\r\nindebted for a series of masterly researches, wherein he exposes the\r\nlooseness and general baselessness of prevalent notions regarding the\r\ntransmutation of one ferment into another.  He guards himself against\r\nsaying it is impossible.  The true investigator is sparing in the use\r\nof this word, though the use of it is unsparingly ascribed to him;\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, Pasteur has never, been able to effect the\r\nalleged transmutation, while he has been always able to point out the\r\nopen doorways through which the affirmers of such transmutations had\r\nallowed error to march in upon them. [Footnote: 'Those who wish for an\r\nillustration of the care necessary in these researches, and of the\r\ncarelessness with which they have in some cases been conducted, will\r\ndo well to consult the Rev. W. H. Dallinger's excellent 'Notes on\r\nHeterogenesis' in the October number of the Popular Science Review.]\r\n\r\nThe great source of error here has been already alluded to in this\r\ndiscourse.  The observers worked in an atmosphere charged with the\r\ngerms of different organisms; the mere accident of first possession\r\nrendering now one organism, now another, triumphant.  In different\r\nstages, moreover, of its fermentative or putrefactive changes, the\r\nsame infusion may so alter as to be successively taken possession of\r\nby different organisms.  Such cases have been adduced to show that the\r\nearlier organisms must have been transformed into the later ones,\r\nwhereas they are simply cases in which different germs, because of\r\nchanges in the infusion, render themselves valid at different times.\r\n\r\nBy teaching us how to cultivate each ferment in its purity--in other\r\nwords, by teaching us how to rear the individual organism apart from\r\nall others,--Pasteur has enabled us to avoid all these errors.  And\r\nwhere this isolation of a particular organism has been duly effected\r\nit grows and multiplies indefinitely, but no change of it into another\r\norganism is ever observed.  In Pasteur's researches the Bacterium\r\nremained a Bacterium, the Vibrio a Vibrio, the Penicillium a\r\nPenicillium, and the Torula a Torula.  Sow any of these in a state of\r\npurity in an appropriate liquid; you get it, and it alone, in the\r\nsubsequent crop.  In like manner, sow small-pox in the human body,\r\nyour crop is small-pox.  Sow there scarlatina, and your crop is\r\nscarlatina.  Sow typhoid virus, your crop is typhoid--cholera, your\r\ncrop is cholera.  The disease bears as constant a relation to its\r\n_contagium_ as the microscopic organisms just enumerated do to their\r\ngerms, or indeed as a thistle does to its seed.  No wonder then, with\r\nanalogies so obvious and so striking, that the conviction is spreading\r\nand growing daily in strength, that reproductive parasitic life is at\r\nthe root of epidemic disease--that living ferments finding lodgment in\r\nthe body increase there and multiply, directly ruining the tissue on\r\nwhich they subsist, or destroying life indirectly by the generation of\r\npoisonous compounds within the body.  This conclusion, which comes to\r\nus with a presumption almost amounting to demonstration, is clinched\r\nby the fact that virulently infective diseases have been discovered\r\nwith which living organisms are as closely and as indissolubly\r\nassociated as the growth of Torula is with the fermentation of beer.\r\n\r\nAnd here, if you will permit me, I would utter a word of warning to\r\nwell-meaning people.  We have now reached a phase of this question\r\nwhen it is of the very last importance that light should once for all\r\nbe thrown upon the manner in which contagious and infectious diseases\r\ntake root and spread.  To this end the action of various ferments upon\r\nthe organs and tissues of the living body must be studied; the habitat\r\nof each special organism concerned in the production of each specific\r\ndisease must be determined, and the mode by which its germs are spread\r\nabroad as sources of further infection.  It is only by such rigidly\r\naccurate enquiries that we can obtain final and complete mastery over\r\nthese destroyers.  Hence, while abhorring cruelty of all kinds, while\r\nshrinking sympathetically from all animal suffering--suffering which\r\nmy own pursuits never call upon me to inflict,--an unbiassed survey of\r\nthe field of research now opening out before the physiologist causes\r\nme to conclude, that no greater calamity could befall the human race\r\nthan the stoppage of experimental enquiry in this direction.  A lady\r\nwhose philanthropy has rendered her illustrious said to me some time\r\nago, that science was becoming immoral; that the researches of the\r\npast, unlike those of the present, were carried on without cruelty.  I\r\nreplied to her that the science of Kepler and Newton, to which she\r\nreferred, dealt with the laws and phenomena of inorganic nature; but\r\nthat one great advance made by modern science was in the direction of\r\nbiology, or the science of life; and that in this new direction\r\nscientific enquiry, though at the outset pursued at the cost of some\r\ntemporary suffering, would in the end prove a thousand times more\r\nbeneficent than it had ever hitherto been.  I said this because I saw\r\nthat the very researches which the lady deprecated were leading us to\r\nsuch a knowledge of epidemic diseases as will enable us finally to\r\nsweep these scourges of the human race from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThis is a point of such capital importance that I should like to bring\r\nit home to your intelligence by a single trustworthy illustration.  In\r\n1850, two distinguished French observers, MM. Davainne and Rayer,\r\nnoticed in the blood, of animals which had died of the virulent\r\ndisease called splenic fever, small microscopic organisms resembling\r\ntransparent rods, but neither of them at that time attached any\r\nsignificance to the observation.  In 1861, Pasteur published a memoir\r\non the fermentation of butyric acid, wherein he described the organism\r\nwhich provoked it; and after reading this memoir it occurred to\r\nDavainne that splenic fever might be a case of fermentation set up\r\nwithin the animal body, by the organisms which had been observed by\r\nhim and Rayer.  This idea has been placed beyond all doubt by\r\nsubsequent research.\r\n\r\nObservations of the highest importance have also been made on splenic\r\nfever by Pollender and Brauell.  Two years ago, Dr. Burdon Sanderson\r\ngave us a very clear account of what was known up to that time of this\r\ndisorder.  With regard to the permanence of the _contagium_, it had been\r\nproved to hang for years about localities where it had once prevailed;\r\nand this seemed to show that the rod-like organisms could not\r\nconstitute the _contagium_, because their infective power was found to\r\nvanish in a few weeks.  But other facts established an intimate\r\nconnection between the organisms and the disease, so that a review of\r\nall the facts caused Dr. Sanderson to conclude that the _contagium_\r\nexisted in two distinct forms: the one 'fugitive' and visible as\r\ntransparent rods; the other permanent but 'latent,' and not yet\r\nbrought within the grasp of the microscope.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Dr. Sanderson was writing this report, a young German\r\nphysician, named Koch, [Footnote: This, I believe, was the first\r\nreference to the researches of Koch made in this country.  1879.]\r\noccupied with the duties of his profession in an obscure country\r\ndistrict, was already at work, applying, during his spare time,\r\nvarious original and ingenious devices to the investigation of splenic\r\nfever.  He studied the habits of the rod-like organisms, and found the\r\naqueous humour an ox's eye to be particularly suitable for their\r\nnutria.  With a drop of the aqueous humour he mixed tiniest speck of a\r\nliquid containing the rods, placed the drop under his microscope,\r\nwarmed it suitably, and observed the subsequent action.  During the\r\nfirst two hours hardly any change was noticeable; but at the end of\r\nthis time the rods began to lengthen, and the action was so rapid that\r\nat the end of three or four hours they attained from ten to twenty\r\ntimes their original length.  At the end of a few additional hours\r\nthey had formed filaments in many cases a hundred times the length of\r\nthe original rods.  The same filament, in fact, was frequently\r\nobserved to stretch through several fields of the microscope.\r\nSometimes they lay in straight lines parallel to each other, in other\r\ncases they were bent, twisted, and coiled into the most graceful\r\nfigures; while sometimes they formed knots of such bewildering\r\ncomplexity that it was impossible for the eye to trace the individual\r\nfilaments through the confusion.\r\n\r\nHad the observation ended here an interesting scientific fact would\r\nhave been added to our previous store, but the addition would have\r\nbeen of little practical value.  Koch, however, continued to watch the\r\nfilaments, and after a time noticed little dots appearing within them.\r\nThese dots became more and more distinct, until finally the whole\r\nlength of the organism was studded with minute ovoid bodies, which lay\r\nwithin the outer integument like peas within their shell.  By-and-by\r\nthe integument fell to pieces, the place of the organisms being taken\r\nby a long row of seeds or spores.  These observations, which were\r\nconfirmed in all respects by the celebrated naturalist, Cohn of\r\nBreslau, are of the highest importance.  They clear up the existing\r\nperplexity regarding the latent and visible _contagia_ of splenic fever;\r\nfor in the most conclusive manner, Koch proved the spores, as\r\ndistinguished from the rods, to constitute the _contagium_ of the fever\r\nin its most deadly and persistent form.\r\n\r\nHow did he reach this important result?  Mark the answer.  There was\r\nbut one way open to him to test the activity of the _contagium_, and\r\nthat was the inoculation with it of living animals.  He operated upon\r\nguinea-pigs and rabbits, but the vast majority of his experiments were\r\nmade upon mice.  Inoculating them with the fresh blood of an animal\r\nsuffering from splenic fever, they invariably died of the same disease\r\nwithin twenty or thirty hours after inoculation.  He then sought to\r\ndetermine how the _contagium_ maintained its vitality.  Drying the\r\ninfectious blood containing the rod-like organisms, in which, however,\r\nthe spores were not developed, he found the _contagium_ to be that which\r\nDr. Sanderson calls 'fugitive.' It maintained its power of infection\r\nfor five weeks at the furthest. He then dried blood containing the\r\nfully-developed spores, and posed the substance to a variety of\r\nconditions.  He permitted the dried blood to assume the form of dust;\r\nwetted this dust, allowed it to dry again, permitted it to remain for\r\nan indefinite time in the midst of putrefying matter, and subjected it\r\nto various other tests.  After keeping the spore-charged blood which\r\nhad been treated in this fashion for four years, he inoculated a\r\nnumber of mice with it, and found its action as fatal as that of blood\r\nfresh from the veins of an animal suffering from splenic fever.  There\r\nwas no single escape from death after inoculation by this deadly\r\n_contagium_.  Uncounted millions of these spores are developed in the\r\nbody of every animal which has died of splenic fever, and every spore\r\nof these millions is competent to produce the disease.  The name of\r\nthis formidable parasite is Bacillus anthracis. [Footnote: Koch found\r\nthat to produce its characteristic effects the _contagium_ of splenic\r\nfever must enter the blood; the virulently festive spleen of a\r\ndiseased animal may be eaten with impunity by mice.  On the other\r\nhand, the disease refuses to be communicated by inoculation to dogs,\r\npartridges, or sparrows.  In their blood Bacillus anthracis ceases to\r\nact as a ferment.  Pasteur announced more than six years ago the\r\npropagation of the vibrios of the silkworm disease called _flacherie_,\r\nboth by fission and by spores.  He also made some remarkable\r\nexperiments on the permanence of the _contagium_ in the form of spores.\r\nSee 'Etudes sur la Maladie des Vers à Soie,' pp. 168 and 256.]\r\n\r\nNow the very first step towards the extirpation of these _contagia_ is\r\nthe knowledge of their nature; and the knowledge brought to us by Dr.\r\nKoch will render as certain the stamping out of splenic fever as the\r\nstoppage of the plague of _pébrine_ by the researches of Pasteur.\r\n[Footnote: Surmising that the immunity enjoyed by birds might arise\r\nfrom the heat of their blood, which destroyed the bacillus, Pasteur\r\nlowered their temperature artificially, inoculated them, and killed\r\nthem.  He also raised the temperature of guinea-pigs after\r\ninoculation, and saved them.  It is needless to dwell for a moment on\r\nthe importance of this experiment.]  One small item of statistics\r\nwill show what this implies.  In the single district of Novgorod in\r\nRussia, between the years 1867 and 1870, over fifty-six thousand cases\r\nof death by splenic fever, among horses, cows, and sheep were\r\nrecorded.  Nor did its ravages confine themselves to the animal world,\r\nfor during the time and in the district referred to, five hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight human beings perished in the agonies of the same disease.\r\n\r\nA description of the fever will help you to come to a right decision\r\non the point which I wish to submit to your consideration.  'An\r\nanimal,' says Dr. Burdon Sanderson, 'which perhaps for the previous\r\nday has declined food and shown signs of general disturbance, begins\r\nto shudder and to have twitches of the muscles of the back, and soon\r\nafter becomes weak and listless.  In the meantime the respiration\r\nbecomes frequent and often difficult, and the temperature rises three\r\nor four degrees above the normal; but soon convulsions, affecting\r\nchiefly the muscles of the back and loins, usher in the final collapse\r\nof which the progress is marked by the loss of all power of moving the\r\ntrunk or extremities, diminution of temperature, mucous and\r\nsanguinolent alvine evacuations, and similar discharges from the mouth\r\nand nose.' In a single district of Russia, as above remarked,\r\nfifty-six thousand horses, cows, and sheep, and five hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight men and women, perished in this way during a period of\r\ntwo or three years.  What the annual fatality is throughout Europe I\r\nhave no means of knowing.  Doubtless it must be very great.  The\r\nquestion, then, which I wish to submit to your judgment is this: Is\r\nthe knowledge which reveals to us the nature, and which assures the\r\nextirpation, of a disorder so virulent and so vile, worth the price\r\npaid for it?  It is exceedingly important that assemblies like the\r\npresent should see clearly the issues at stake in such questions as\r\nthis, and that the properly informed sense of the community should\r\ntemper, if not restrain, the rashness of those who, meaning to be\r\ntender, become agents of cruelty by the imposition of short-sighted\r\nrestrictions upon physiological investigations.  It is a modern\r\ninstance of zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, the excesses\r\nof which must be corrected by an instructed public opinion.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAnd now let us cast a backward glance on the field we have traversed,\r\nand try to extract from our labours such further profit as they can\r\nyield.  For more than two thousand years the attraction of light\r\nbodies by amber was the sum of human knowledge regarding electricity,\r\nand for more than two thousand years fermentation was effected without\r\nany knowledge of its cause.  In science one discovery grows out of\r\nanother, and cannot appear without its proper antecedent.  Thus,\r\nbefore fermentation could be understood, the microscope had to be\r\ninvented, and brought to a considerable degree of perfection.  Note\r\nthe growth of knowledge.  Leeuwenhoek, in 1680, found yeast to be a\r\nmass of floating globules, but he had no notion that the globules were\r\nalive.  This was proved in 1835 by Cagniard de la Tour and Schwann.\r\nThen came the question as to the origin of such microscopic organisms,\r\nand in this connection '`the memoir of Pasteur, published in the\r\n'Annales de Chimie' for 1862, is the inauguration of a new epoch.\r\n\r\nOn that investigation all Pasteur's subsequent labours were based.\r\nRavages had over and over again occurred among French wines.  There\r\nwas no guarantee that they ould not become acid or bitter, particularly\r\nwhen exported.  The commerce in wines was thus restricted, and disastrous\r\nlosses were ften inflicted on the wine-grower.  Every one of these\r\ndiseases was traced to the life of an organism.  Pasteur ascertained the\r\ntemperature which killed these ferments of disease, proving it to be\r\nso low as to be perfectly harmless to the wine.  By the simple\r\nexpedient of heating the wine to a temperature of fifty degrees\r\nCentigrade, he rendered it inalterable, and thus saved his country the\r\nloss of millions.  He then went on to vinegar--vin aigre, acid\r\nwine--which he proved to be produced by a fermentation set up by a\r\nlittle fungus called Mycoderma aceti. Torula, in fact, converts the\r\ngrape juice into alcohol, and Mycoderma aceti converts the alcohol\r\ninto vinegar.  Here also frequent failures occurred, and severe losses\r\nwere sustained.  Through the operation of unknown causes, the vinegar\r\noften became unfit for use, sometimes indeed falling into utter\r\nputridity.  It had been long known that mere exposure to the air was\r\nsufficient to destroy it.  Pasteur studied all these changes, traced\r\nthem to their living causes, and showed that the permanent health of\r\nthe vinegar was ensured by the destruction of this life.  He passed\r\nfrom the diseases of vinegar to the study of a malady which a dozen\r\nyears ago had all but ruined the silk husbandry of France.  This\r\nplague, which received the name of _pébrine_, was the product of a\r\nparasite which first took possession of the intestinal canal of the\r\nsilkworm, spread throughout its body, and filled the sack which ought\r\nto contain the viscid matter of the silk.  Thus smitten, the worm\r\nwould go automatically through the process of spinning when it had\r\nnothing to spin.\r\n\r\nPasteur followed this parasitic destroyer from year to year, and led\r\nby his singular power of combining facts with the logic of facts,\r\ndiscovered eventually the precise phase in the development of the\r\ninsect when the disease which assailed it could with certainty be\r\nstamped out.  Pasteur's devotion to this enquiry cost him dear.  He\r\nrestored to France her silk husbandry, rescued thousands of her\r\npopulation from ruin, set the looms of Italy also to work, but emerged\r\nfrom his labours with one of his sides permanently paralysed.  His\r\nlast investigation is embodied in a work entitled 'Studies on Beer,'\r\nin which he describes a method of rendering beer permanently\r\nunchangeable.  That method is not so simple as those found effectual\r\nwith wine and vinegar, but the principles which it involves are sure\r\nto receive extensive application at some future day.\r\n\r\nThere are other reflections connected with this subject which, even\r\nwere they now passed over without remark, would sooner or later occur\r\nto every thoughtful mind in this assembly.  I have spoken of the\r\nfloating dust of the air, of the means of rendering it visible, and of\r\nthe perfect immunity from putrefaction which accompanies the contact\r\nof germless infusions and moteless air.  Consider the woes which these\r\nwafted particles, during historic and pre-historic ages, have\r\ninflicted on mankind; consider the loss of life in hospitals from\r\nputrefying wounds; consider the loss in places where there are plenty\r\nof wounds, but no hospitals, and in the ages before hospitals were\r\nanywhere founded; consider the slaughter which has hitherto followed\r\nthat of the battlefield, when those bacterial destroyers are let\r\nloose, often producing a mortality far greater than that of the battle\r\nitself; add to this the other conception that in times of epidemic\r\ndisease the self-same floating matter has frequently, if not always,\r\nmingled with it the special germs which produce the epidemic, being\r\nthus enabled to sow pestilence and death over nations and\r\ncontinents--consider all this, and you will come with me to the\r\nconclusion that all the havoc of war, ten times multiplied, would be\r\nevanescent if compared with the ravages due to atmospheric dust.\r\n\r\nThis preventible destruction is going on to-day, and it has been\r\npermitted to go on for ages, without a whisper of information\r\nregarding its cause being vouchsafed to the suffering sentient world.\r\nWe have been scourged by invisible thongs, attacked from impenetrable\r\nambuscades, and it is only to-day that the light of science is being\r\nlet in upon the murderous dominion of our foes.  Facts like these\r\nexcite in me the thought that the rule and governance of this universe\r\nare different from what we in our youth supposed them to be--that the\r\ninscrutable Power, at once terrible and beneficent, in whom we live\r\nand move and have our being and our end, is to be propitiated by means\r\ndifferent to those usually resorted to.  The first requisite towards\r\nsuch propitiation is knowledge; the second is action, shaped and\r\nilluminated by that knowledge.  Of knowledge we already see the dawn,\r\nwhich will open out by-and-by to perfect day; while the action which\r\nis to follow has its unfailing source and stimulus in the moral and\r\nemotional nature of man--in his desire for personal well-being, in his\r\nsense of duty, in his compassionate sympathy with the sufferings of\r\nhis fellow-men.  'How often,' says Dr. William Budd in his celebrated\r\nwork on Typhoid Fever,--' How often have I seen in past days, in the\r\nsingle narrow chamber of the day-labourer's cottage the father in the\r\ncoffin, the mother in the sick-bed in muttering delirium, and nothing\r\nto relieve the desolation of the children but the devotion of some\r\npoor neighbour, who in too many cases paid the penalty of kindness in\r\nbecoming herself the victim of the same disorder!' From the vantage\r\nground already won I look forward with confident hope to the triumph\r\nof medical art over scenes of misery like that here described.  The\r\ncause of the calamity being once clearly revealed, not only to the\r\nphysician, but to the public, whose intelligent co-operation is\r\nabsolutely essential to success, the final victory of humanity is only\r\na question of time.  We have already a foretaste of that victory in\r\nthe triumphs f surgery as practised at your doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXIII.  SPONTANEOUS GENERATION.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The Nineteenth Century, January 1878.]\r\n\r\nWITHIN ten minutes' walk of a little cottage which I have recently\r\nbuilt in the Alps, there is a small lake, fed by the melted snows of\r\nthe upper mountains.  During the early weeks of summer no trace of\r\nlife is to be discerned in this water; but invariably towards the end\r\nof July, or the beginning of August, swarms of tailed organisms are\r\nseen enjoying the sun's warmth along the shallow margins of the lake,\r\nand rushing with audible patter into deeper water at the approach of\r\ndanger.  The origin of this periodic crowd of living things is by no\r\nmeans obvious.  For years I had never noticed in the lake either an\r\nadult frog, or the smallest fragment of frog spawn; so that were I not\r\notherwise informed, I should have found the conclusion of Mathiole a\r\nnatural one, namely, that tadpoles are generated in lake mud by the\r\nvivifying action of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe checks which experience alone can furnish being absent, the\r\nspontaneous generation of creatures quite as high as the frog in the\r\nscale of being was assumed for ages to be a fact.  Here, as elsewhere,\r\nthe dominant mind of Aristotle stamped its notions on the world at\r\nlarge.  For nearly twenty centuries after him men found no difficulty\r\nin believing in cases of spontaneous generation which would now be\r\nrejected as monstrous by the most fanatical supporter of the doctrine.\r\nShell-fish of all kinds were considered to be without parental origin.\r\nEels were supposed to spring spontaneously from the fat ooze of the\r\nNile.  Caterpillars were the spontaneous products of the leaves on\r\nwhich they fed; while winged insects, serpents, rats, and mice were\r\nall thought capable of being generated without sexual intervention.\r\n\r\nThe most copious source of this life without an ancestry was\r\nputrefying flesh; and, lacking the checks imposed by fuller\r\ninvestigation, the conclusion that flesh possesses and exerts this\r\ngenerative power is a natural one.  I well remember when a child of\r\nten or twelve seeing a joint of imperfectly salted beef cut into, and\r\ncoils of maggots laid bare within the mass.  Without a moment's\r\nhesitation I jumped to the conclusion that these maggots had been\r\nspontaneously generated in the meat.  I had no knowledge which could\r\nqualify or oppose this conclusion, and for the time it was\r\nirresistible.  The childhood of the individual typifies that of the\r\nrace, and the belief here enunciated was that of the world for nearly\r\ntwo thousand years.\r\n\r\nTo the examination of this very point the celebrated Francesco Redi,\r\nphysician to the Grand Dukes Ferdinand II. and Cosmo III. of\r\nTuscany, and a member of the Academy del Cimento, addressed himself in\r\n1668.  He had seen the maggots of putrefying flesh, and reflected on\r\ntheir possible origin.  But he was not content with mere reflection,\r\nnor with the theoretic guesswork which his predecessors had founded\r\nupon their imperfect observations.  Watching meat during its passage\r\nfrom freshness to decay, prior to the appearance of maggots he\r\ninvariably observed flies buzzing round the meat and frequently\r\nalighting on it.  The maggots, he thought, might be the half-developed\r\nprogeny of these flies.\r\n\r\nThe inductive guess precedes experiment, by which, however, it must be\r\nfinally tested.  Redi knew this, and acted accordingly.  Placing fresh\r\nmeat in a jar and covering the mouth with paper, he found that, though\r\nthe meat putrefied in the ordinary way, it never bred maggots, while\r\nthe same meat placed in open jars soon swarmed with these organisms.\r\nFor the paper cover he then substituted fine gauze, through which the\r\nodour of the meat could rise.  Over it the flies buzzed, and on it\r\nthey laid their eggs, but, the meshes being too small to permit the\r\neggs to fall through, no maggots were generated in the meat.  They\r\nwere, on the contrary, hatched upon the gauze.  By a series of such\r\nexperiments Redi destroyed the belief in the spontaneous generation of\r\nmaggots in meat, and with it doubtless many related beliefs.  The\r\ncombat was continued by Vallisneri, Schwammerdam, and Réaumur, who\r\nsucceeded in banishing the notion of spontaneous generation from the\r\nscientific minds of their day.  Indeed, as regards such complex\r\norganisms as those which formed the subject of their researches, the\r\nnotion was banished for ever.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery and improvement of the microscope, though giving a\r\ndeath-blow to much that had been previously written and believed\r\nregarding spontaneous generation, brought also into view a world of\r\nlife formed of individuals so minute--so close as it seemed to the\r\nultimate particles of matter--as to suggest an easy passage from atoms\r\nto organisms.  Animal and vegetable infusions exposed to the air were\r\nfound clouded and crowded with creatures far beyond the reach of\r\nunaided vision, but perfectly visible to an eye strengthened by the\r\nmicroscope.  With reference to their origin these organisms were\r\ncalled 'Infusoria.  Stagnant pools were found full of them, and the\r\nobvious difficulty of assigning a germinal origin to existences so\r\nminute furnished the precise condition necessary to give new play to\r\nthe notion of heterogenesis or spontaneous generation.\r\n\r\nThe scientific world was soon divided into two hostile camps, the\r\nleaders of which only can here be briefly alluded to.  On the one\r\nside, we have Buffon and Needham, the former postulating his 'organic\r\nmolecules,' and the latter assuming the existence of a special\r\n'vegetative force' which drew the molecules together so as to form\r\nliving things.  On the other side, we have the celebrated Abbé Lazzaro\r\nSpallanzani, who in 1777 published results counter to those announced\r\nby Needham in 1748, and obtained by methods so precise as to\r\ncompletely overthrow the convictions based upon the labours of his\r\npredecessor.  Charging his flasks with organic infusions, he sealed\r\ntheir necks with the blowpipe, subjected them in this condition to the\r\nheat of boiling water, and subsequently exposed them to temperatures\r\nfavourable to the development of life.  The infusions continued\r\nunchanged for months, and when the flasks were subsequently opened no\r\ntrace of life was found.\r\n\r\nHere I may forestall matters so far as to say that the success of\r\nSpallanzani's experiments depended wholly on the locality in which he\r\nworked.  The air around him must have been free from the more obdurate\r\ninfusorial germs, for otherwise the process he followed would, as was\r\nlong afterwards proved by Wyman, have infallibly yielded life.  But\r\nhis refutation of the doctrine of spontaneous generation is not the\r\nless valid on this account.  Nor is it in any way upset by the fact,\r\nthat others in repeating his experiments obtained life where he\r\nobtained none.  Rather is the refutation strengthened by such\r\ndifferences.  Given two experimenters equally skilful and equally\r\ncareful, operating in different places on the same infusion, in the\r\nsame way, and assuming the one to obtain life while the other fails to\r\nobtain it; then its well-established absence in the one case proves\r\nthat some ingredient foreign to the infusion must be its cause in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani's sealed flasks contained but small quantities of air, and\r\nas oxygen was afterwards shown to be generally essential to life, it\r\nwas thought that the absence of life observed by Spallanzani might\r\nhave been due to the lack of this vitalising gas.  To dissipate this\r\ndoubt, Schulze in 1836 half filled a flask with distilled water to\r\nwhich animal and vegetable matters were added.  First boiling his\r\ninfusion to destroy whatever life it might contain, Schulze sucked\r\ndaily into his flask air which had passed through a series of bulbs\r\ncontaining concentrated sulphuric acid, where all germs of life\r\nsuspended in the air were supposed to be destroyed.  From May to\r\nAugust this process was continued without any development of\r\ninfusorial life.\r\n\r\nHere again the success of Schulze was due to his working in\r\ncomparatively pure air, but even in such air his experiment is a very\r\nrisky one.  Germs will pass unwetted and unscathed through sulphuric\r\nacid unless the most special care is taken to detain them.  I have\r\nrepeatedly failed, by repeating Schulze's experiments, to obtain his\r\nresults.  Others have failed likewise.  The air passes in bubbles\r\nthrough the bulbs, and to render the method secure, the passage of the\r\nair must be so slow as to cause the whole of its floating matter, even\r\nto the very core of each bubble, to touch the surrounding liquid.  But\r\nif this precaution be observed, water will be found quite as effectual\r\nas sulphuric acid.  By the aid of an air-pump, in a highly infective\r\natmosphere I have thus drawn air for weeks without intermission, first\r\nthrough bulbs containing water, and afterwards through vessels containing\r\norganic infusions, without any appearance of life.  The germs were not\r\nkilled by the water, but they were effectually intercepted, while the\r\nobjection that the air had been injured by being brought into contact\r\nwith strongly corrosive substances was avoided.\r\n\r\nThe brief paper of Schulze, published in Poggendorf's Annalen for\r\n1836, was followed in 1837 by another short and pregnant communication\r\nby Schwann.\r\n\r\nRedi, as we have seen, traced the maggots of putrefying flesh to the\r\neggs of flies.  But he did not and he could not know the meaning of\r\nputrefaction itself.  He had not the instrumental means to inform him\r\nthat it also is a phenomenon attendant on the development of life.\r\nThis was first proved in the paper now alluded to.  Schwann placed\r\nflesh in a flask filled to one-third of its capacity with water,\r\nsterilised the flask by boiling, and then supplied it for months with\r\ncalcined air.  Throughout this time there appeared no mould, no\r\ninfusoria, no putrefaction; the flesh remained unaltered, while the\r\nliquid continued as clear as it was immediately after boiling. Schwann\r\nthen varied his experimental argument, with no alteration in the\r\nresult.  His final conclusion was, that putrefaction is due to\r\ndecompositions of organic matter attendant on the multiplication\r\ntherein of minute organisms.  These organisms were derived not from\r\nthe air, but from something contained in the air, which was destroyed\r\nby a sufficiently high temperature.  There never was a more determined\r\nopponent of the doctrine of spontaneous generation than Schwann,\r\nthough a strange attempt was made a year and a half ago to enlist him\r\nand others equally opposed to it on the side of the doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe physical character of the agent which produces putrefaction was\r\nfurther revealed by Helmholtz in 1843.  By means of a membrane, he\r\nseparated a sterilised putrescible liquid from a putrefying one.  The\r\nsterilised infusion remained perfectly intact.  Hence it was not the\r\nliquid of the putrefying mass--for that could freely diffuse through\r\nthe membrane--but something contained in the liquid, and which was\r\nstopped by the membrane, that caused the putrefaction.  In 1854\r\nSchroeder and von Dusch struck into this enquiry, which was\r\nsubsequently followed up by Schroeder alone.  These able experimenters\r\nemployed plugs of cotton-wool to filter the air supplied to their\r\ninfusions.  Fed with such air, in the great majority of cases the\r\nputrescible liquids remained perfectly sweet after boiling.  Milk\r\nformed a conspicuous exception to the general rule.  It putrefied\r\nafter boiling, though supplied with carefully filtered air.  The\r\nresearches of Schroeder bring us up to the year 1859.\r\n\r\nIn that year a book was published which seemed to overturn some of the\r\nbest established facts of previous investigators.  Its title was\r\nHétérogénie, and its author was F.  A.  Pouchet, Director of the\r\nMuseum of Natural History at Rouen.  Ardent, laborious, learned, full\r\nnot only of scientific but of metaphysical fervour, he threw his whole\r\nenergy into the enquiry.  Never did a subject require the exercise of\r\nthe cold critical faculty more than this one--calm study in the\r\nunravelling of complex phenomena, care in the preparation of\r\nexperiments, care in their execution, skilful variation of conditions,\r\nand incessant questioning of results until repetition had placed them\r\nbeyond doubt or question.  To a man of Pouchet's temperament the\r\nsubject was full of danger--danger not lessened by the theoretic bias\r\nwith which he approached it.  This is revealed by the opening words of\r\nhis preface: 'Lorsque, par la meditation, it fut evident pour moi que\r\nla generation spontanée était encore Fun des moyens qu'emploie la\r\nnature pour la reproduction des êtres, je m'appliquai à découvrir par\r\nquell procédés on pouvait parvenir à en mettre les phénomènes en\r\nevidence: It is needless to say that such a prepossession required a\r\nstrong curb.  Pouchet repeated the experiments of Schulze and Schwann\r\nwith results diametrically opposed to theirs.  He heaped experiment\r\nupon experiment and argument upon argument, spicing with the sarcasm\r\nof the advocate the logic of the man of science.  In view of the\r\nmultitudes required to produce the observed results, he ridiculed the\r\nassumption of atmospheric germs.  This was one of his strongest\r\npoints. 'Si les Proto-organismes que nous voyons pulluler partout et\r\ndans tout, avaient leurs germes dissembles dans l'atmosphère, dans la\r\nproportion mathématiquement indispensable a cet effet, l'air en serait\r\ntotalement obscurci, car ill devraient s 'y trouver beaucoup plus\r\nserrés que les globules d'eau qui forment, nos nuages épais.  Il n'y a\r\npas là la moindre exagération.'  Recurring to the subject, he\r\nexclaims: 'L'air dans lequel noun vivons aurait presque la densité du\r\nfer.'  There is often a virulent contagion in a confident tone, and\r\nthis hardihood of argumentative assertion was sure to influence minds\r\nswayed not by knowledge, but by authority.  Had Pouchet known that\r\n'the blue ethereal sky' is formed of suspended particles, through\r\nwhich the sun freely shines, he would hardly have ventured upon this\r\nline of argument.\r\n\r\nPouchet's pursuit of this enquiry strengthened the conviction with\r\nwhich he began it, and landed him in downright credulity in the end. I\r\ndo not question his ability as an observer, but the enquiry needed a\r\ndisciplined experimenter.  This latter implies not mere ability to\r\nlook at things as Nature offers them to our inspection, but to force\r\nher to show herself under conditions prescribed by the experimenter\r\nhimself.  Here Pouchet lacked the necessary discipline.  Yet the\r\nvigour of his onset raised clouds of doubt, which for a time obscured\r\nthe whole field of enquiry.  So difficult indeed did the subject seem,\r\nand so incapable of definite solution, that when Pasteur made known\r\nhis intention to take it up, his friends Biot and Dumas expressed\r\ntheir regret, earnestly exhorting him to set a definite and rigid\r\nlimit to the time he purposed spending in this apparently unprofitable\r\nfield. [Footnote: 'Je ne conseillerais à personne,' said Dumas to his\r\nalready famous pupil, 'de rester trop longtemps dans ce\r\nsujet.'--Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 1862, vol. lxiv. p. 22.\r\nSince that time the illustrious Perpetual Secretary of the Academy of\r\nSciences has had good reason to revise this 'counsel.']\r\n\r\nSchooled by his education as a chemist, and by special researches on\r\nthe closely related question of fermentation, Pasteur took up this\r\nsubject under particularly favourable conditions.  His work and his\r\nculture had given strength and finish to his natural aptitudes.  In\r\n1862, accordingly, he published a paper 'On the Organised Corpuscles\r\nexisting in the Atmosphere,' which must for ever remain classical. By\r\nthe most ingenious devices he collected the floating particles of the\r\nair surrounding his laboratory in the Rue d'Ulm, and subjected them to\r\nmicroscopic examination.  Many of them he found to be organised\r\nparticles.  Sowing them in sterilised infusions, he obtained abundant\r\ncrops of microscopic organisms.  By more refined methods he repeated\r\nand confirmed the experiments of Schwann, which had been contested by\r\nPouchet, Montegazza, Joly, and Musset.  He also confirmed the\r\nexperiments of Schroeder and von Dusch.  He showed that the cause\r\nwhich communicated life to his infusions was not uniformly diffused\r\nthrough the air; that there were aerial interspaces which possessed no\r\npower to generate life. Standing on the Mer de Glace, near the\r\nMontanvert, he snipped off the ends of a number of hermetically sealed\r\nflasks containing organic infusions.  One out of twenty of the flasks\r\nthus supplied with glacier air showed signs of life afterwards, while\r\neight out of twenty of the same infusions, supplied with the air of\r\nthe plains, became crowded with life.  He took his flasks into the\r\ncaves under the Observatory of Paris, and found the still air in these\r\ncaves devoid of generative power.  These and other experiments,\r\ncarried out with a severity perfectly obvious to the instructed\r\nscientific reader, and accompanied by a logic equally severe, restored\r\nthe conviction that, even in these lower raches of the scale of being,\r\nlife does not appear without the operation of antecedent life.\r\n\r\nThe main position of Pasteur has been strengthened by practical\r\nresearches of the most momentous kind.  He has applied the knowledge\r\nwon from his enquiries to the preservation of wine and beer, to the\r\nmanufacture of vinegar, to the staying of the plague which threatened\r\nutter destruction of the silk husbandry of France, and to the\r\nexamination of other formidable diseases which assail the higher\r\nanimals, including man.  His relation to the improvements which\r\nProfessor Lister has introduced into surgery, is shown by a letter\r\nquoted in his Etudes sur la Bière. [Footnote: 1 P. 43.]  Professor\r\nLister there expressly thanks Pasteur for having given him the only\r\nprinciple which could have conducted the antiseptic system to a\r\nsuccessful issue.  The strictures regarding defects of reasoning, to\r\nwhich we have been lately accustomed, throw abundant light upon their\r\nauthor, but no shade upon Pasteur.\r\n\r\nRedi, as we have seen, proved the maggots of putrefying flesh to be\r\nderived from the eggs of flies; Schwann proved putrefaction itself to\r\nbe the concomitant of far lower forms of life than those dealt with by\r\nRedi.  Our knowledge here, as elsewhere in connection with this\r\nsubject, has been vastly extended by Professor Cohn, of Breslau.  'No\r\nputrefaction,' he says, 'can occur in a nitrogenous substance if its\r\nbacteria be destroyed and new ones prevented from entering it.\r\nPutrefaction begins as soon as bacteria, even in the smallest numbers,\r\nare admitted either accidentally or purposely.  It progresses in\r\ndirect proportion to the multiplication of the bacteria, it is\r\nretarded when they exhibit low vitality, and is stopped by all\r\ninfluences which either hinder their development or kill them.  All\r\nbactericidal media are therefore antiseptic and disinfecting.'\r\n[Footnote: In his last excellent memoir Cohn expresses himself thus:\r\n'Wer noch heut die Faeulniss von einer spontanen Dissociation der\r\nProteinmolecule, oder von einem unorganisirten Ferment ableitet, oder\r\ngar aus \"Stickstoffsplittern\" die Balken zur Stuetze seiner\r\nFaeulnisstheorie zu zimmern versucht, hat zuerst den Satz \"keine\r\nFaeulniss ohne Bacterium Termo\" zu widerlegen.']\r\n\r\nIt was these organisms acting in wound and abscess which so frequently\r\nconverted our hospitals into charnel-houses, and it is their\r\ndestruction by the antiseptic system that now renders justifiable\r\noperations which no surgeon would have attempted a few years ago. The\r\ngain is immense--to the practising surgeon as well as to the patient\r\npractised upon.  Contrast the anxiety of never feeling sure whether\r\nthe most brilliant operation might not be rendered nugatory by the\r\naccess of a few particles of unseen hospital dust, with the comfort\r\nderived from the knowledge that all power of mischief on the part of\r\nsuch dust has been surely and certainly annihilated.  But the action\r\nof living _contagia_ extends beyond the domain of the surgeon. The power\r\nof reproduction and indefinite self-multiplication which is\r\ncharacteristic of living things, coupled with the undeviating fact of\r\n_contagia_ 'breeding true,' has given strength and consistency to a\r\nbelief long entertained by penetrating minds, that epidemic diseases\r\ngenerally are the concomitants of parasitic life. 'There begins to be\r\nfaintly visible to us a vast and destructive laboratory of nature\r\nwherein the diseases which are most fatal to animal life, and the\r\nchanges to which dead organic matter passively liable, appear bound\r\ntogether by what must least be called a very close analogy of\r\ncausation.' [Footnote: Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy\r\nCouncil, 1874, p. 5.]  According to this view, which, as I have said,\r\nis daily gaining converts, a contagious disease may be defined a\r\nconflict between the person smitten by it and a specific organism\r\nwhich multiplies at his expense, appropriating his air and moisture,\r\ndisintegrating his tissues, or poisoning him by the decompositions\r\nincident to its growth.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years extending from 1859 to 1869, researches on\r\nradiant heat in its relations to the gaseous form of matter occupied\r\nmy continual attention.  When air was experimented on, I had to\r\ncleanse it effectually of floating matter, and while doing so I was\r\nsurprised to notice that, at the ordinary rate of transfer, such\r\nmatter passed freely through alkalis, acids, alcohols, and ethers. The\r\neye being kept sensitive by darkness, a concentrated beam of light was\r\nfound to be a most searching test for suspended matter both in water\r\nand in air--a test indeed indefinitely more searching and severe than\r\nthat furnished by the most powerful microscope.  With the aid of such\r\na beam I examined air filtered by cotton-wool; air long kept free from\r\nagitation, so as to allow the floating matter to subside; calcined\r\nair, and air filtered by the deeper cells of the human lungs.  In all\r\ncases the correspondence between my experiments and those of\r\nSchroeder, Pasteur, and Lister in regard to spontaneous generation was\r\nperfect.  The air which they found inoperative was proved by the\r\nluminous beam to be optically pure and therefore germless.  Having\r\nworked at the subject both by experiment and reflection, on Friday\r\nevening, January 21, 1870, I brought it before the members of the\r\nRoyal Institution.  Two or three months subsequently, for sufficient\r\npractical reasons, I ventured to direct public attention to the\r\nsubject in a letter to the Times.  Such was my first contact with this\r\nimportant question.\r\n\r\nThis letter, I believe, gave occasion for the first public utterance\r\nof Dr. Bastian in relation to this subject.  He did me the honour to\r\ninform me, as others had informed Pasteur, that the subject 'pertains\r\nto the biologist and physician: He expressed 'amazement' at my\r\nreasoning, and warned me that before what I had done could be undone\r\n'much irreparable mischief might be occasioned.'  With far less\r\npreliminary experience to guide and warn him, the English heterogenist\r\nwas far bolder than Pouchet in his experiments, and far more\r\nadventurous in his conclusions.  With organic infusions he obtained\r\nthe results of his celebrated predecessor, but he did much more--the\r\natoms and molecules of inorganic liquids passing under his\r\nmanipulation into those more 'complex chemical compounds,' which we\r\ndignify by calling them 'living organisms.' [Footnote: 'It is further\r\nheld that bacteria or allied organisms are prone to be engendered as\r\ncorrelative products, coming into existence in the several\r\nfermentations, just as independently as other less complex chemical\r\ncompounds.'--Bastian, Trans. of Pathological Society, vol. xxvi.\r\n258.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the public who take an interest in such things, and\r\napparently also as regards a large portion of the medical profession,\r\nour clever countryman succeeded in restoring the subject to a state of\r\nuncertainty similar to that which followed the publication of\r\nPouchet's volume in 1859.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that this uncertainty should be removed from all\r\nminds, and doubly desirable on practical grounds that it should be\r\nremoved from the minds of medical men.  In the present article,\r\ntherefore, I propose discussing this question face to face with some\r\neminent and fair-minded member of the medical profession who, as\r\nregards spontaneous generation, entertains views adverse to mine. Such\r\na one it would be easy to name; but it is perhaps better to rest in\r\nthe impersonal.  I shall therefore simply call my proposed co-enquirer\r\nmy friend.  With him at my side, I shall endeavour, to the best of my\r\nability, so to conduct this discussion that he who runs may read and\r\nthat he who reads may understand.\r\n\r\nLet us begin at the beginning.  I ask my friend to step into the\r\nlaboratory of the Royal Institution, where I place before him a basin\r\nof thin turnip slices barely covered with distilled water kept a\r\ntemperature of 120° Fahr.  After digesting the turnip for four or five\r\nhours we pour off the liquid, boil it, filter it, and obtain an\r\ninfusion as clear as filtered drinking water.  We cool the infusion,\r\ntest its specific gravity, and find it to be 1006 or higher--water\r\nbeing 1000.  A number of small clean empty flasks, of the shape shown\r\non the margin, are before us.  One of them is slightly warmed with a\r\nspirit-lamp, and its open end is then dipped into the turnip infusion.\r\nThe warmed glass is afterwards chilled, the air within the flasks\r\ncools, contracts, and is followed in its contraction by the infusion.\r\nThus we get a small quantity of liquid into the flask.  We now heat\r\nthis liquid carefully.  Steam is produced, which issues from the open\r\nneck, carrying the air of the flask along with it.  After a few\r\nseconds' ebullition, the open neck is again Plunged into the infusion.\r\nThe steam within the flask condenses, the liquid enters to supply its\r\nplace, and in this way we fill our little flask to about four-fifths\r\nof its volume.  This description is typical; we may thus fill a\r\nthousand flasks with a thousand different infusions.\r\n\r\nI now ask my friend to notice a trough made of sheet copper, with two\r\nrows of handy little Bunsen burners underneath it.  This trough, or\r\nbath, is nearly filled with oil; a piece of thin plank constitutes a\r\nkind of lid for the oil-bath.  The wood is perforated with circular\r\napertures wide enough to allow our small flask to pass through and\r\nplunge itself in the oil, which has been heated, say, to 250° Fahr.\r\nClasped all round by the hot liquid, the infusion in the flask rises\r\nto its boiling point, which is not sensibly over 212° Fahr.  Steam\r\nissues from the open neck of the flask, and the boiling is continued\r\nfor five minutes.  With a pair of small brass tongs, an assistant now\r\nseizes the neck near its junction with the flask, and partially lifts\r\nthe latter out of the oil.  The steam does not cease to issue, but its\r\nviolence is abated.  With a second pair of tongs held in one hand, the\r\nneck of the flask is seized close to its open end, while with the\r\nother hand a Bunsen's flame or an ordinary spirit flame is brought\r\nunder the middle of the neck.  The glass reddens, whitens, softens,\r\nand as it is gently drawn out the neck diminishes in diameter, until\r\nthe canal is completely blocked up.  The tongs with the fragment of\r\nsevered neck being withdrawn, the flask, with its contents diminished\r\nby evaporation, is lifted from the oil-bath perfectly sealed\r\nhermetically.\r\n\r\nSixty such flasks filled, boiled, and sealed in the manner described,\r\nand containing strong infusions of beef, mutton, turnip, and cucumber,\r\nare carefully packed in sawdust, and transported to the Alps. Thither,\r\nto an elevation of about 7,000 feet above the sea, I invite my\r\nco-enquirer to accompany me.  It is the month of July, and the weather\r\nis favourable to putrefaction.  We open our box at the Bel-Alp, and\r\ncount out fifty-four flasks, with their liquids as clear as filtered\r\ndrinking water.  In six flasks, however, the infusion is found muddy.\r\nWe closely examine these, and discover that every one of them has had\r\nits fragile end broken off in the transit from London. Air has entered\r\nthe flasks, and the observed muddiness is the result. My colleague\r\nknows as well as I do what this means.  Examined with a pocket-lens,\r\nor even with a microscope of insufficient power, nothing is seen in\r\nthe muddy liquid; but regarded with a magnifying power of a thousand\r\ndiameters or so, what an astonishing appearance does it present!\r\nLeeuwenhoek estimated the population of a single drop of stagnant\r\nwater at 500,000,000: probably the population of a drop of our turbid\r\ninfusion would be this many times multiplied.  The field of the\r\nmicroscope is crowded with organisms, some wabbling slowly, others\r\nshooting rapidly across the microscopic field.  They dart hither and\r\nthither like a rain of minute projectiles; they pirouette and spin so\r\nquickly round, that the retention of the retinal impression transforms\r\nthe little living rod into a twirling wheel.  And yet the most\r\ncelebrated naturalists tell us they are vegetables.  From the rod-like\r\nshape which they so frequently assume, these organisms are called\r\n'bacteria'--a term, be it here remarked, which covers organisms of\r\nvery diverse kinds.\r\n\r\nHas this multitudinous life been spontaneously generated in these six\r\nflasks, or is it the progeny of living germinal matter carried into\r\nthe flasks by the entering air?  If the infusions have a\r\nself-generative power, how are the sterility and consequent clearness\r\nof the fifty-four uninjured flasks to be accounted for?  My colleague\r\nmay urge--and fairly urge--that the assumption of germinal matter is\r\nby no means necessary; that the air itself may be the one thing needed\r\nto wake up the dormant infusions.  We will examine this point\r\nimmediately.  But meanwhile I would remind him that I am working on\r\nthe exact lines laid down by our most conspicuous heterogenist. He\r\ndistinctly affirms that the withdrawal of the atmospheric pressure\r\nabove the infusion favours the production of organisms; and he\r\naccounts for their absence in tins of preserved meat, fruit, and\r\nvegetables, by the hypothesis that fermentation has begun in such\r\ntins, that gases have been generated, the pressure of which has\r\nstifled the incipient life and stopped its further development.\r\n[Footnote: _Beginnings of Life_,  vol. i.]  This is the new\r\ntheory of preserved meats.  Had its author pierced a tin of preserved\r\nmeat, fruit, or vegetable under water with the view of testing its\r\ntruth, he would have found it erroneous.  In well-preserved tins he\r\nwould have found, not an outrush of gas, but an inrush of water.  I\r\nhave noticed this recently in tins which have lain perfectly good for\r\nsixty-three years in the Royal Institution.  Modern tins, subjected to\r\nthe same test, yielded the same result.  From time to time, moreover,\r\nduring the last two years, I have placed glass tubes, containing clear\r\ninfusions of turnip, hay, beef, and mutton, in iron bottles, and\r\nsubjected them to air-pressures varying from ten to twenty-seven\r\natmospheres--pressures, it is needless to say, far more than\r\nsufficient to tear a preserved meat tin to shreds.  After ten days\r\nthese infusions were taken from their bottles rotten with putrefaction\r\nand teeming with life.  Thus collapses an hypothesis which had no\r\nrational foundation, and which could never have seen the light had the\r\nslightest attempt been made to verify it.\r\n\r\nOur fifty-four vacuous and pellucid flasks also declare against the\r\nheterogenist. We expose them to a warm Alpine sun by day, and at night\r\nwe suspend them in a warm kitchen.  Four of them have been\r\naccidentally broken; but at the end of a month we find the fifty\r\nremaining ones as clear as at the commencement.  There is no sign of\r\nputrefaction or of life in any of them.  We divide these flasks into\r\ntwo groups of twenty-three and twenty-seven respectively (an accident\r\nof counting rendered the division uneven).  The question now is\r\nwhether the admission of air can liberate any generative energy in the\r\ninfusions.  Our next experiment will answer this question and\r\nsomething more.  We carry the flasks to a hayloft, and there, with a\r\npair of steel pliers, snip off the sealed ends of the group of\r\nthree-and-twenty.  Each snipping off is of course followed by an\r\ninrush of air.  We now carry our twenty-seven flasks, our pliers, and\r\na spirit-lamp, to a ledge overlooking the Aletsch glacier, about 200\r\nfeet above the hayloft, from which ledge the mountain falls almost\r\nprecipitously to the north-east for about a thousand feet.  A gentle\r\nwind blows towards us from the north-east--that is, across the crests\r\nand snow-fields of the Oberland mountains.  We are therefore bathed by\r\nair which must have been for a good while out of practical contact\r\nwith either animal or vegetable life.  I stand carefully to leeward of\r\nthe flasks, for no dust or particle from my clothes or body must be\r\nblown towards them.  An assistant ignites the spirit-lamp, into the\r\nflame of which I plunge the pliers, thereby destroying all attached\r\ngerms or organisms.  Then I snip off the sealed end of the flask.\r\nPrior to every snipping the same process is gone through, no flask\r\nbeing opened without the previous cleansing of the pliers by the\r\nflame.  In this way we charge our seven-and-twenty flasks with clean\r\nvivifying mountain air.\r\n\r\nWe place the fifty flasks, with their necks open, over a kitchen\r\nstove, in a temperature varying from 50° to 90° Fahr, and in three\r\ndays find twenty-one out of the twenty-three flasks opened on the\r\nhayloft invaded by organisms--two only of the group remaining free\r\nfrom them.  After three weeks' exposure to precisely the same\r\nconditions, not one of the twenty-seven flasks opened in free air had\r\ngiven way.  No germ from the kitchen air had ascended the narrow\r\nnecks, the flasks being shaped to produce this result.  They are still\r\nin the Alps, as clear, I doubt not, and as free from life as they were\r\nwhen sent off from London. [Footnote: An actual experiment made at the\r\nBel Alp is here described.]\r\n\r\nWhat is my colleague's conclusion from the experiment before us?\r\nTwenty-seven putrescible infusions, first in vacuo, and afterwards\r\nsupplied with the most invigorating air, have shown no sign of\r\nputrefaction or of life.  And as to the others, I almost shrink from\r\nasking him whether the hayloft has rendered them spontaneously\r\ngenerative.  Is not the inference here imperative that it is not the\r\nair of the loft--which is connected through a constantly open door\r\nwith the general atmosphere--but something contained in the air, that\r\nhas produced the effects observed?  What is this something?  A sunbeam\r\nentering through a chink in the roof or wall, and traversing the air\r\nof the loft, would show it to be laden with suspended dust particles.\r\nIndeed the dust is distinctly visible in the diffused daylight.  Can\r\nit have been the origin of the observed life?  If so, are we not bound\r\nby all antecedent experience to regard these fruitful particles as the\r\ngerms of the life observed?\r\n\r\nThe name of Baron Liebig has been constantly mixed up with these\r\ndiscussions.  'We have,' it is said, 'his authority for assuming that\r\ndead decaying matter can produce fermentation.' True, but with Liebig\r\nfermentation was by no means synonymous with life.  It meant,\r\naccording to him, the shaking asunder by chemical disturbance of\r\nunstable molecules.  Does the life of our flasks, then, proceed from\r\ndead particles?  If my co-enquirer should reply 'Yes,' then I would\r\nask him, 'What warrant does Nature offer for such an assumption?\r\nWhere, amid the multitude of vital phenomena in which her operations\r\nhave been clearly traced, is the slightest countenance given to the\r\nnotion that the sowing of dead particles can produce a living crop?'\r\nWith regard to Baron Liebig, had he studied the revelations of the\r\nmicroscope in relation to these questions, a mind so penetrating could\r\nnever have missed the significance of the facts revealed.  He,\r\nhowever, neglected the microscope, and fell into error--but not into\r\nerror so gross as that in support of which his authority has been\r\ninvoked.  Were he now alive, he would, I doubt not, repudiate the use\r\noften made of his name--Liebig's view of fermentation was at least a\r\nscientific one, founded on profound conceptions of molecular\r\ninstability.  But this view by no means involves the notion that the\r\nplanting of dead particles--'Stickstoffsplittern' as Cohn\r\ncontemptuously calls them--is followed by the sprouting of infusorial\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLet us now return to London and fix our attention on the dust of its\r\nair.  Suppose a room in which the housemaid has just finished her work\r\nto be completely closed, with the exception of an aperture in a\r\nshutter through which a sunbeam enters and crosses the room.  The\r\nfloating dust reveals the track of the light.  Let a lens be placed in\r\nthe aperture to condense the beam.  Its parallel rays are now\r\nconverged to a cone, at the apex of which the dust is raised to almost\r\nunbroken whiteness by the intensity of its illumination.  Defended\r\nfrom all glare, the eye is peculiarly sensitive to this, scattered\r\nlight.  The floating dust of London rooms is organic, and may be\r\nburned without leaving visible residue.  The action of a spirit-lamp\r\nflame upon the floating matter has been elsewhere thus described:\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIn a cylindrical beam which strongly illuminated the dust of our\r\nlaboratory, I placed an ignited spirit-lamp.  Mingling with the flame,\r\nand round its rim, were seen curious wreaths of darkness resembling an\r\nintensely black smoke.  On placing the flame at some distance below\r\nthe beam, the same dark masses stormed upwards.  They were blacker\r\nthan the blackest smoke ever seen issuing from the funnel of a\r\nsteamer; and their resemblance to smoke was so perfect as to prompt\r\nthe conclusion that the apparently pure flame of the alcohol-lamp\r\nrequired but a beam of sufficient intensity to reveal its clouds of\r\nliberated carbon.\r\n\r\nBut is the blackness smoke?  This question presented itself in a\r\nmoment, and was thus answered: A red-hot poker was placed underneath\r\nthe beam; from it the black wreaths also ascended.  A large hydrogen\r\nflame, which emits no smoke, was next employed, and it also produced\r\nwith augmented copiousness those whirling masses of darkness.  Smoke\r\nbeing out of the question, what is the blackness?  It is simply that\r\nof stellar space; that is to say, blackness resulting from the absence\r\nfrom the track of the beam of all matter competent to scatter its\r\nlight.  When the flame was placed below the beam, the floating matter\r\nwas destroyed in situ; and the heated air, freed from this matter,\r\nrose into the beam, jostled aside the illuminated particles, and\r\nsubstituted for their light the darkness due to its own perfect\r\ntransparency.  Nothing could more forcibly illustrate the invisibility\r\nof the agent which renders all things visible.  The beam crossed,\r\nunseen, the black chasm formed by the transparent air, while, at both\r\nsides of the gap, the thick-strewn particles shone out like a luminous\r\nsolid under the powerful illumination. [Footnote: See Fragment: 'On\r\nDust and Disease', vol. i.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nSupposing an infusion intrinsically barren, but readily susceptible of\r\nputrefaction when exposed to common air, to be brought into contact\r\nwith this unilluminable air, what would be the result?  It would never\r\nputrefy.  It might, however, be urged that the air is spoiled by its\r\nviolent calcination.  Oxygen passed through a spirit-lamp flame is, it\r\nmay be thought, no longer the oxygen suitable for the development and\r\nmaintenance of life.  We have an easy escape from this difficulty,\r\nwhich is based, however, upon the unproved assumption that the air has\r\nbeen affected by the flame.  Let a condensed beam be sent through a\r\nlarge flask or bolthead containing common air.  The track of the beam\r\nis seen within the flask--the dust revealing the light, and the light\r\nrevealing the dust. Cork the flask, stuff its neck with cotton-wool,\r\nor simply turn it mouth downwards and leave it undisturbed for a day\r\nor two.  Examined afterwards with the luminous beam, no track is\r\nvisible; the light passes through the flask as through a vacuum.  The\r\nfloating matter has abolished itself, being now attached to the\r\ninterior surface of the flask.\r\n\r\nWere it our object, as it will be subsequently, to effectually detain\r\nthe dirt, we might coat that surface with some sticky substance. Here,\r\nthen, without 'torturing' the air in any way, we have found a means of\r\nridding it, or rather of enabling it to rid itself, of floating\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWe have now to devise a means of testing the action of such\r\nspontaneously purified air upon putrescible infusions.  Wooden\r\nchambers, or cases, are accordingly constructed, having glass fronts,\r\nside-windows, and back-doors.  Through the bottoms of the chambers\r\ntest-tubes pass air-tight; their open ends, for about one-fifth of the\r\nlength of the tubes, being within the chambers.  Provision is made for\r\na free connection rough sinuous channels between the inner and the\r\nouter air.  Through such channels, though open, no dust will reach the\r\nchamber.  The top of each chamber is perforated by a circular hole two\r\ninches in diameter, closed air-tight by a sheet of India-rubber.  This\r\nis pierced in the middle by a pin, and through the pin-hole is pushed\r\nthe shank of a long pipette, ending above in a small funnel.  The\r\nshank also passes through a stuffing-box of cotton-wool moistened with\r\nglycerine; so that, tightly clasped by the rubber and wool, the\r\npipette is not likely in its motions up and down to carry any dust\r\ninto the chamber.  The annexed woodcut shows a chamber, with six\r\ntest-tubes, its side-windows w w, its pipette p c, and its sinuous\r\nchannels a b which connect the air of the chamber with the outer air.\r\n\r\nThe chamber is carefully closed and permitted to remain quiet for two\r\nor three days.  Examined at the beginning by a beam sent through its\r\nwindows, the air is found laden with floating matter, which in three\r\ndays has wholly disappeared.  To prevent its ever rising again, the\r\ninternal surface of the chamber was at the outset coated with\r\nglycerine.  The fresh but putrescible liquid is introduced into the\r\nsix tubes in succession by means of the pipette.  Permitted to remain\r\nwithout further precaution, every one of the tubes would putrefy and\r\nfill itself with life.  The liquid has been in contact with the\r\ndust-laden air outside by which it has been infected, and the\r\ninfection must be destroyed.  This is done by plunging the six tubes\r\ninto a bath of heated oil and boiling the infusion.  The time\r\nrequisite to destroy the infection depends wholly upon its nature. Two\r\nminutes' boiling suffices to destroy some _contagia_, whereas two\r\nhundred minutes' boiling fails to destroy others.  After the infusion\r\nhas been sterilised, the oil-bath is withdrawn, and the liquid, whose\r\nputrescibility has been in no way affected by the boiling, is\r\nabandoned to the air of the chamber.\r\n\r\nWith such chambers I tested, in the autumn and winter of 1875-6,\r\ninfusions of the most various kinds, embracing natural animal liquids,\r\nthe flesh and viscera of domestic animals, game, fish, and vegetables.\r\nMore than fifty chambers, each with its series of infusions, were\r\ntested, many of them repeatedly.  There was no shade of uncertainty in\r\nany of the results.  In every instance we had, within the chamber,\r\nperfect limpidity and sweetness, which in some cases lasted for more\r\nthan a year--without the chamber, with the same infusion, putridity\r\nand its characteristic smells.  In no instance was the least\r\ncountenance lent to the notion that an infusion deprived by heat of\r\nits inherent life, and placed in contact with air cleansed of its\r\nvisibly suspended matter, has any power to generate life anew.\r\n\r\nRemembering then the number and variety of the infusions employed, and\r\nthe strictness of our adherence to the rules of preparation laid down\r\nby the heterogenists themselves; remembering that we have operated\r\nupon the very substances recommended by them as capable of furnishing,\r\neven in untrained hands, easy and decisive proofs of spontaneous\r\ngeneration, and that we have added to their substances many others of\r\nour own--if this pretended generative power were a reality, surely it\r\nmust have manifested itself somewhere.  Speaking roundly, I should say\r\nthat in such closed chambers at least five hundred chances have been\r\ngiven to it, but it has nowhere appeared.\r\n\r\nThe argument is now to be clenched by an experiment which will remove\r\nevery residue of doubt as to the ability of the infusions here\r\nemployed to sustain life.  We open the back doors of our sealed\r\nchambers, and permit the common air with its floating particles to\r\nhave access to our tubes.  For three months they have remained\r\npellucid and sweet--flesh, fish, and vegetable extracts purer than\r\never cook manufactured.  Three days' exposure to the dusty air\r\nsuffices to render them muddy, fetid, and swarming with infusorial\r\nlife.  The liquids are thus proved, one and all, ready for\r\nputrefaction when the contaminating agent is applied.  I invite my\r\ncolleague to reflect on these facts.  How will he account for the\r\nabsolute immunity of a liquid exposed for months in a warm room to\r\noptically pure air, and its infallible putrefaction in a few days when\r\nexposed to dust-laden air?  He must, I submit, bow to the conclusion\r\nthat the dust-particles are the cause of putrefactive life.  And\r\nunless he accepts the hypothesis that these particles, being dead in\r\nthe air, are in the liquid miraculously kindled into living things, he\r\nmust conclude that the life we have observed springs from germs or\r\norganisms diffused through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe experiments with hermetically sealed flasks have reached the\r\nnumber of 940.  A sample group of 130 of them were laid before the\r\nRoyal Society on January 13, 1876.  They were utterly free from life,\r\nhaving been completely sterilised by three minutes' boiling.  Special\r\ncare had been taken that the temperatures to which the flasks were\r\nexposed should include those previously alleged to be efficient.  The\r\nconditions laid down by the heterogenist were accurately copied, but\r\nthere was no corroboration of his results.  Stress was then laid on\r\nthe question of warmth, thirty degrees being suddenly added to the\r\ntemperatures with which both of us had previously worked.  Waiving all\r\nprotest against the caprice thus manifested, I met this new\r\nrequirement also.  The sealed tubes, which had proved barren in the\r\nRoyal Institution, were suspended in perforated boxes, and placed\r\nunder the supervision of an intelligent assistant in the Turkish Bath\r\nin Jermyn Street.  From two to six days had been allowed for the\r\ngeneration of organisms in hermetically sealed tubes.  Mine remained\r\nin the washing-room of the bath for nine days.  Thermometers placed in\r\nthe boxes, and read off twice or three times a day, showed the\r\ntemperature to vary from a minimum of 101° to a maximum of 112° Fahr.\r\nAt the end of nine days the infusions were as clear as at the\r\nbeginning.  They were then removed to a warmer position.  A\r\ntemperature of 115° had been mentioned as particularly favourable to\r\nspontaneous generation.  For fourteen days the temperature of the\r\nTurkish Bath hovered about this point, falling once as low as 106°,\r\nreaching 116° on three occasions, 118° on one, and 119° on two.  The\r\nresult was quite the same as that just recorded.  The higher\r\ntemperatures proved perfectly incompetent to develope life.\r\n\r\nTaking the actual experiment we have made as a basis of calculation,\r\nif our 940 flasks were opened on the hayloft of the Bel Alp, 858 of\r\nthem would become filled with organisms.  The escape of the remaining\r\n82 strengthens our case, proving as it does conclusively that not in\r\nthe air, nor in the infusions, nor in anything continuous diffused\r\nthrough the air, but in discrete particles, suspended in the air and\r\nnourished by the infusions, we are to seek the cause of life.  Our\r\nexperiment proves these particles to be in some cases so far apart on\r\nthe hayloft as to permit 10 per cent of our flasks to take in air\r\nwithout contracting contamination.  A quarter of a century ago Pasteur\r\nproved the cause of 'so-called spontaneous generation' to be\r\ndiscontinuous.  I have already referred to his observation that 12 out\r\nof 20 flasks opened on the plains escaped infection, while 19 out of\r\n20 flasks opened on the Mer de Glace escaped.  Our own experiment at\r\nthe Bel Alp is a more emphatic instance of the same kind, 90 per cent\r\nof the flasks opened in the hayloft being smitten, while not one of\r\nthose opened on the free mountain ledge was attacked.\r\n\r\nThe power of the air as regards putrefactive infection is incessantly\r\nchanging through natural causes, and we are able to alter it at will.\r\nOf a number of flasks opened in 1876 in the laboratory of the Royal\r\nInstitution, 42 per cent.  were smitten, while 58 per cent.  escaped.\r\nIn 1877 the proportion in the same laboratory was 68 per cent.\r\nsmitten, to 32 intact.  The greater mortality, so to speak, of the\r\ninfusions in 1877 was due to the presence of hay which diffused its\r\ngerminal dust in the laboratory air, causing it to approximate as\r\nregards infective virulence to the air of the Alpine loft.  I would\r\nask my friend to bring his scientific penetration to bear upon all the\r\nforegoing facts.  They do not prove spontaneous generation to be\r\n'impossible.' My assertions, however, relate not to 'possibilities,'\r\nbut to proofs, and the experiments just described do most 'distinctly\r\nprove the evidence on which the heterogenist relies to be written on\r\nwaste paper.\r\n\r\nMy colleague will not, I am persuaded, dispute these results; but he\r\nmay be disposed to urge that other able and honourable men working at\r\nthe same subject have arrived at conclusions different from mine. Most\r\nfreely granted; but let me here recur to the remarks already made in\r\nspeaking of the experiments of Spallanzani, to the effect that the\r\nfailure of others to confirm his results by no means upsets their\r\nevidence.  To fix the ideas, let us suppose that my colleague comes to\r\nthe laboratory of the Royal Institution, repeats there my experiments,\r\nand obtains confirmatory results; and that he then goes to University\r\nor King's College where, operating with the same infusions, he obtains\r\ncontradictory results.  Will he be disposed to conclude that the\r\nselfsame substance is barren in Albemarle Street and fruitful in Gower\r\nStreet or the Strand?  His Alpine experience has already made known to\r\nhim the literally infinite differences existing between different\r\nsamples of air as regards their capacity for putrefactive infection.\r\nAnd, possessing this knowledge, will he not substitute for the\r\nadventurous conclusion that an organic infusion is barren at one place\r\nand spontaneously generative at another, the more rational and obvious\r\none that the atmospheres of the two localities which have had access\r\nto the infusion are infective in different degrees?\r\n\r\nAs regards workmanship, moreover, he will not fail to bear in mind,\r\nthat fruitfulness may be due to errors of manipulation, while\r\nbarrenness involves the presumption of correct experiment.  It is only\r\nthe careful worker that can secure the latter, while it is open to\r\nevery novice to obtain the former.  Barrenness is the result at which\r\nthe conscientious experimenter, whatever his theoretic convictions may\r\nbe, ought to aim, omitting no pains to secure it, and resorting only\r\nwhen there is no escape from it to the conclusion that the life\r\nobserved comes from no source which correct experiment could\r\nneutralise or avoid.\r\n\r\nLet us again take a definite case.  Supposing my colleague to operate\r\nwith the same apparent care on 100 infusions--or rather on 100 samples\r\nof the same infusion--and that 50 of them prove fruitful and 50\r\nbarren.  Are we to say that the evidence for and against heterogeny is\r\nequally balanced? There are some who would not only say this, but who\r\nwould treasure up the 50 fruitful flasks as 'positive' results, and\r\nlower the evidential value of the 50 barren flasks by labelling them\r\n'negative' results.  This, as shown by Dr. William Roberts, is an\r\nexact inversion of the true order of the terms positive and negative.\r\n[Footnote: See his truly philosophical remarks on this head in the\r\n'British Medical Journal,' 1876, p. 282.]  Not such, I trust, would\r\nbe the course pursued by my friend.  As regards the 50 fruitful flasks\r\nhe would, I doubt not, repeat the experiment with redoubled care and\r\nscrutiny, and not by one repetition only, but by many, assure himself\r\nthat he had not fallen into error.  Such faithful scrutiny fully\r\ncarried out would infallibly lead him to the conclusion that here, as\r\nin all other cases, the evidence in favour of spontaneous generation\r\ncrumbles in the grasp of the competent enquirer.\r\n\r\nThe botanist knows that different seeds possess different powers of\r\nresistance to heat. [Footnote: I am indebted to Dr. Thiselton Dyer for\r\nvarious illustrations of such differences.  It is, however, surprising\r\nthat a subject of such high scientific importance should not have been\r\nmore thoroughly explored.  Here the scoundrels who deal in killed\r\nseeds might be able to add to our knowledge.]  Some are killed by a\r\nmomentary exposure to the boiling temperature, while others withstand\r\nit for several hours.  Most of our ordinary seeds are rapidly killed,\r\nwhile Pouchet made known to the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1866,\r\nthat certain seeds, which had been transported in fleeces of wool from\r\nBrazil, germinated after four hours' boiling.  The germs of the air\r\nvary as much among themselves as the seeds of the botanist. In some\r\nlocalities the diffused germs are so tender that boiling for five\r\nminutes, or even less, would be sure to destroy them all; in other\r\nlocalities the diffused germs are so obstinate, that many hours'\r\nboiling would be requisite to deprive them of their power of\r\ngermination.  The absence or presence of a truss of desiccated hay\r\nwould produce differences as great as those here described.  The\r\ngreatest endurance that I have ever observed--and I believe it is the\r\ngreatest on record--was a case of survival after eight hours' boiling.\r\n\r\nAs regards their power of resisting heat, the infusorial germs of our\r\natmosphere might be classified under the following and intermediate\r\nheads: Killed in five minutes; not killed in five minutes but killed\r\nin fifteen; not killed in fifteen minutes but killed in thirty; not\r\nkilled in thirty minutes but killed in an hour; not killed in an hour\r\nbut killed in two hours; not killed in two but killed in three hours;\r\nnot killed in three but killed in four hours.  I have had several\r\ncases of survival after four and five hours' boiling, some survivals\r\nafter six, and one after eight hours' boiling.  Thus far has\r\nexperiment actually reached; but there is no valid warrant for fixing\r\nupon even eight hours as the extreme limit of vital resistance.\r\nProbably more extended researches (though mine have been very\r\nextensive) would reveal germs more obstinate still.  It is also\r\ncertain that we might begin earlier, and find germs which are\r\ndestroyed by a temperature far below that of boiling water.  In the\r\npresence of such facts, to speak of a death-point of bacteria and\r\ntheir germs would be unmeaning--but of this more anon.\r\n\r\n'What present warrant,' it has been asked, 'is there for supposing\r\nthat a naked, or almost naked, speck of protoplasm can withstand four,\r\nsix, or eight hours' boiling?'  Regarding naked specks of protoplasm I\r\nmake no assertion.  I know nothing about them, save as the creatures\r\nof fancy.  But I do affirm, not as a 'supposition,' nor an\r\n'assumption,' nor a 'probable guess,' nor as 'a wild hypothesis,' but\r\nas a matter of the most undoubted fact, that the spores of the hay\r\nbacillus, when thoroughly desiccated by age, have withstood the ordeal\r\nmentioned.  And I further affirm that these obdurate germs, under the\r\nguidance of the knowledge that they are germs, can be destroyed by\r\nfive minutes' boiling, or even less.  This needs explanation.  The\r\nfinished bacterium perishes at a temperature far below that of boiling\r\nwater, and it is fair to assume that the nearer the germ is to its\r\nfinal sensitive condition the more readily will it succumb to heat.\r\nSeeds soften before and during germination.  This premised, the simple\r\ndescription of the following process will suffice to make its meaning\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nAn infusion infected with the most powerfully resistent germs, but\r\notherwise protected against the floating matters of the air, is\r\ngradually raised to its boiling-point.  Such germs as have reached the\r\nsoft and plastic state immediately preceding their development into\r\nbacteria are thus destroyed.  The infusion is then put aside in a warm\r\nroom for ten or twelve hours.  If for twenty-four, we might have the\r\nliquid charged with well-developed bacteria.  To anticipate this, at\r\nthe end of ten or twelve hours we raise the infusion a second time to\r\nthe boiling temperature, which, as before, destroys all germs then\r\napproaching their point of final development.  The infusion is again\r\nput aside for ten or twelve hours, and the process of heating is\r\nrepeated.  We thus kill the germs in order of their resistance, and\r\nfinally kill the last of them.  No infusion can withstand this process\r\nif it be repeated a sufficient number of times.  Artichoke, cucumber,\r\nand turnip infusions, which had proved specially obstinate when\r\ninfected with the germs of desiccated hay, were completely broken down\r\nby this method of discontinuous heating, three minutes being found\r\nsufficient to accomplish what three hundred minutes' continuous\r\nboiling failed to accomplish.  I applied the method, moreover, to\r\ninfusions of various kinds of hay, including those most tenacious of\r\nlife.  Not one of them bore the ordeal.  These results were clearly\r\nforeseen before they were realised, so that the germ theory fulfils\r\nthe test of every true theory, that test being the power of prevision.\r\n\r\nWhen 'naked or almost naked specks of protoplasm' are spoken of, the\r\nimagination is drawn upon, not the objective truth of Nature.  Such\r\nwords sound like the words of knowledge where knowledge is really nil.\r\nThe possibility of a 'thin covering' is conceded by those who speak in\r\nthis way.  Such a covering may, however, exercise a powerful\r\nprotective influence.  A thin pellicle of India-rubber, for example,\r\nsurrounding a pea keeps it hard in boiling water for a time sufficient\r\nto reduce an uncovered pea to a pulp.  The pellicle prevents\r\nimbibition, diffusion, and the consequent disintegration.  A greasy or\r\noily surface, or even the layer of air which clings to certain bodies,\r\nwould act to some extent in a similar way.  'The singular resistance\r\nof green vegetables to sterilisation,' says Dr. William Roberts,\r\n'appears to be due to some peculiarity of the surface, perhaps their\r\nsmooth glistening epidermis which prevented complete wetting of their\r\nsurfaces.' I pointed out in 1876 that the process by which an\r\natmospheric germ is wetted would be an interesting subject of\r\ninvestigation.  A dry microscope covering-glass may be caused to float\r\non water for a year.  A sewing-needle may be similarly kept floating,\r\nthough its specific gravity is nearly eight times that of water.\r\n\r\nWere it not for some specific relation between the matter of the germ\r\nand that of the liquid into which it falls, wetting would be simply\r\nimpossible.  Antecedent, to all development there must be an\r\ninterchange of matter between the germ and its environment; and this\r\ninterchange must obviously depend upon the relation of the germ to its\r\nencompassing liquid.  Anything that hinders this interchange retards\r\nthe destruction of the germ in boiling water.  In my paper published\r\nin the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1877, I add the following\r\nremark:\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to see that the surface of a seed or germ may be\r\nso affected by desiccation and other causes as practically to prevent\r\ncontact between it and the surrounding liquid.  The body of a germ,\r\nmoreover, may be so indurated by time and dryness as to resist\r\npowerfully the insinuation of water between its constituent molecules.\r\nIt would be difficult to cause such a germ to imbibe the moisture\r\nnecessary to produce the swelling and softening which precede its\r\ndestruction in a liquid of high temperature.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHowever this may be--whatever be the state of the surface, or of the\r\nbody, of the spores of Bacillus subtilis, they do as a matter of\r\ncertainty resist, under some circumstances, exposure for hours to the\r\nheat of boiling water.  No theoretic scepticism can successfully stand\r\nin the way of this fact, established as it has been by hundreds, if\r\nnot thousands, of rigidly conducted experiments.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWe have now to test one of the principal foundations of the doctrine\r\nof spontaneous generation as formulated in this country.  With this\r\nview, I place before my friend and co-enquirer two liquids which have\r\nbeen kept for six months in one of our sealed chambers, exposed to\r\noptically pure air. The one is a mineral solution containing in proper\r\nproportions all the substances which enter into the composition of\r\nbacteria, the other is an infusion of turnip-it might be any one of a\r\nhundred other infusions, animal or vegetable. Both liquids are as\r\nclear as distilled water, and there is no trace of life in either of\r\nthem. They are, in fact, completely sterilised. A mutton-chop, over\r\nwhich a little water has been poured to keep its juices from drying\r\nup, has lain for three days upon a plate in our warm room. It smells\r\noffensively. Placing a drop of the fetid mutton-juice under a\r\nmicroscope, it is found swarming with the bacteria of putrefaction.\r\nWith a speck of the swarming liquid I inoculate the clear mineral\r\nsolution and the clear turnip infusion, as a surgeon might inoculate\r\nan infant with vaccine lymph. In four-and-twenty hours the transparent\r\nliquids have become turbid throughout, and instead of being barren as\r\nat first they are teeming with life. The experiment may be repeated a\r\nthousand times with the same invariable result. To the naked eye the\r\nliquids at the beginning were alike, being both equally transparent-to\r\nthe naked eye they are alike at the end, being both equally muddy.\r\nInstead of putrid mutton-juice, we might take as a source of infection\r\nany one of a hundred other putrid liquids, animal or vegetable. So\r\nlong as the liquid contains living bacteria a speck of it communicated\r\neither to the clear mineral solution, or to the clear turnip infusion,\r\nproduces in twenty-four hours the effect here described.\r\n\r\nWe now vary the experiment thus: Opening the back-door of another\r\nclosed chamber which has contained for months the pure mineral\r\nsolution and the pure turnip infusion side by side, I drop into each\r\nof them a small pinch of laboratory dust. The effect here is tardier\r\nthan when the speck of putrid liquid was employed. In three days,\r\nhowever, after its infection with the dust, the turnip infusion is\r\nmuddy, and swarming as before with bacteria. But what about the\r\nmineral solution which, in our first experiment, behaved in a manner\r\nundistinguishable from the turnip-juice? At the end of three days\r\nthere is not a bacterium to be found in it. At the end of three weeks\r\nit is equally innocent of bacterial life. We may repeat the experiment\r\nwith the solution and the infusion a hundred times with the same\r\ninvariable result. Always in the case of the latter the sowing, of the\r\natmospheric dust yields a crop of bacteria-never in the former does\r\nthe dry germinal matter kindle into active life. [Footnote: This is\r\nthe deportment of the mineral solution as described by others. My own\r\nexperiments would lead me to say that the development of the\r\nbacteria, though exceedingly slow and difficult, is not impossible.]\r\nWhat is the inference which the reflecting mind must draw from this\r\nexperiment?  Is it not as clear as day that while both liquids are\r\nable to feed the bacteria and to enable them to increase and multiply,\r\nafter they have been once, fully developed, only one of the liquids is\r\nable to develope into active bacteria the germinal dust of the air?\r\n\r\nI invite my friend to reflect upon this conclusion he will, I think,\r\nsee that there is no escape from it. He may, if he prefers, hold the\r\nopinion, which I consider erroneous, that bacteria exist in the air,\r\nnot as germs but as desiccated organisms. The inference remains, that\r\nwhile the one liquid is able to force the passage from the inactive to\r\nthe active state, the other is not.\r\n\r\nBut this is not at all the inference which has been drawn from\r\nexperiments with the mineral solution.\r\n\r\nSeeing its ability to nourish bacteria when once inoculated with the\r\nliving active organism, and observing that no bacteria appeared in the\r\nsolution after long exposure to the air, the inference was drawn that\r\nneither bacteria nor their germs existed in the air. Throughout\r\nGermany the ablest literature of the subject, even that opposed to\r\nheterogeny, is infected with this error; while heterogenists at home\r\nand abroad have based upon it a triumphant demonstration of, their\r\ndoctrine. It is proved, they say, by the deportment of the mineral\r\nsolution that neither bacteria nor their germs exist in the air;\r\nhence, if, on exposing a thoroughly sterilised turnip infusion to the\r\nair, bacteria appear, they must of necessity have been spontaneously\r\ngenerated. In the words of Dr. Bastian: 'We can only infer that whilst\r\nthe boiled saline solution is quite incapable of engendering bacteria,\r\nsuch organisms are able to arise _de novo_ in the boiled organic\r\ninfusion.' [Footnote: 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. xxi. p.\r\n130.]\r\n\r\nI would ask my eminent colleague what he thinks of this reasoning now?\r\nThe datum is--'A mineral solution exposed to common air does not\r\ndevelope bacteria;' the inference is--'Therefore if a turnip infusion\r\nsimilarly exposed develope bacteria, they must be spontaneously\r\ngenerated.'  The inference, on the face of it, is an unwarranted one.\r\nBut while as matter of logic it is inconclusive, as matter of fact it\r\nis chimerical. London air is as surely charged with the germs of\r\nbacteria as London chimneys are with smoke. The inference just\r\nreferred to is completely disposed of by the simple question: 'Why,\r\nwhen your sterilised organic infusion is exposed to optically puree\r\nair, should this generation of life _de novo_ utterly cease? Why should\r\nI be able to preserve my turnip-juice side by side with your saline\r\nsolution for the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year, in\r\nfree connection with the general atmosphere, on the sole condition\r\nthat the portion of that atmosphere in contact with the juice shall be\r\nvisibly free from floating dust, while three days' exposure to that\r\ndust fills it with bacteria?' Am I over sanguine in hoping that as\r\nregards the argument here set forth he who runs may read, and he who\r\nreads may understand?\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the calm and thorough consideration of another\r\nsubject, more important if possible than the foregoing one, but like\r\nit somewhat difficult to seize by reason of the very opulence of the\r\nphraseology, logical and rhetorical, in which it has been set forth.\r\nThe subject now to be considered relates to what has been called 'the\r\ndeath-point of bacteria.'  Those who happen to be acquainted with the\r\nmodern English literature of the question will remember how challenge\r\nafter challenge has been issued to panspermatists in general, and to\r\none or two home workers in particular, to come to close quarters on\r\nthis cardinal point. It is obviously the stronghold of the English\r\nheterogenist. 'Water,' he says, `is boiling merrily over a fire when\r\nsome luckless person upsets the vessel so that the heated fluid\r\nexercises its scathing influence upon an uncovered portion of the\r\nbody-hand, arm, or face. Here, at all events, there is no room for\r\ndoubt. Boiling water unquestionably exercises a most pernicious and\r\nrapidly destructive effect upon the living matter of which we are\r\ncomposed.' [Footnote: Bastian, 'Evolution,' p. 133.]  And lest it\r\nshould be supposed that it is the high organisation which, in this\r\ncase, renders the body susceptible to heat, he refers to the action of\r\nboiling water on the hen's egg to dissipate the notion. 'The\r\nconclusion,' he says, 'would seem to force itself upon us that there\r\nis something intrinsically deleterious in the action of boiling water\r\nupon living matter-whether this matter be of high or of low\r\norganisation.' [Footnote: Bastian, 'Evolution,' p. 135.]  Again, at\r\nanother place: 'It has been shown that the briefest exposure to the\r\ninfluence of boiling water is destructive of all living matter.'\r\n[Footnote: Ibid. p. 46]\r\n\r\nThe experiments already recorded plainly show that there is a marked\r\ndifference between the dry bacterial matter of the air, and the wet,\r\nsoft, and active bacteria of putrefying organic liquids. The one can\r\nbe luxuriantly bred in the saline solution, the others refuse to be\r\nborn there, while both of them are copiously developed in a sterilised\r\nturnip infusion. Inferences, as we have already seen, founded on the\r\ndeportment of the one liquid cannot with the warrant of scientific\r\nlogic be extended to the other. But this is exactly what the\r\nheterogenist has done, thus repeating as regards the death-point of\r\nbacteria the error into which he fell concerning the germs of the air.\r\nLet us boil our muddy mineral solution with its swarming bacteria for\r\nfive minutes. In the soft succulent condition in which they exist in\r\nthe solution not one of them escapes destruction. The same is true of\r\nthe turnip infusion if it be inoculated with the living bacteria\r\nonly-the aerial dust being carefully excluded. In both cases the dead\r\norganisms sink to the bottom of the liquid, and without re-inoculation\r\nno fresh organisms will arise. But the case is entirely different when\r\nwe inoculate our turnip infusion with the desiccated germinal matter\r\nafloat in the air.\r\n\r\nThe 'death-point' of bacteria is the maximum temperature at which they\r\ncan live, or the minimum temperature at which they cease to live. If,\r\nfor example, they survive a temperature of 140°, and do not survive a\r\ntemperature of 150°, the death-point lies somewhere between these two\r\ntemperatures.  Vaccine lymph, for example, is proved by Messrs.\r\nBraidwood and Vacher to be deprived of its power of infection by brief\r\nexposure to a temperature between 140° and 150° Fahr. This may be\r\nregarded as the death-point of the lymph, or rather of the particles\r\ndiffused in the lymph, which constitute the real _contagium_.  If no\r\ntime, however, be named for the application of the heat, the term\r\n'death-point' is a vague one.  An infusion, for example, which will\r\nresist five hours' continuous exposure to the boiling temperature,\r\nwill succumb to five days' exposure to a temperature 50° Fahr. below\r\nthat of boiling. The fully developed soft bacteria of putrefying\r\nliquids are not only killed by five minutes' boiling, but by less than\r\na single minute's boiling--indeed, they are slain at about the same\r\ntemperature as the vaccine.  The same is true of the plastic, active\r\nbacteria of the turnip infusion [Footnote: In my paper in the\r\n'Philosophical Transactions' for 1876, I pointed out and illustrated\r\nexperimentally the difference, as regards rapidity of development,\r\nbetween water-germs and air-germs; the growth from the already\r\nsoftened water-germs proving to be practically as rapid as from\r\ndeveloped bacteria. This preparedness of the germ for rapid\r\ndevelopment is associated with its preparedness for rapid\r\ndestruction.]\r\n\r\nBut, instead of choosing a putrefying liquid for inoculation, let us\r\nprepare and employ our inoculating substance in the following simple\r\nway:-Let a small wisp of hay, desiccated by age, be washed in a glass\r\nof water, and let a perfectly sterilised turnip infusion be inoculated\r\nwith the washing liquid. After three hours' continuous boiling the\r\ninfusion thus infected will often develope luxuriant bacterial life.\r\nPrecisely the same occurs if a turnip infusion be prepared in an\r\natmosphere well charged with desiccated hay-germs. The infusion in\r\nthis case infects itself without special inoculation, and its\r\nsubsequent resistance to sterilisation is often very great.  On the\r\n1st of March last I purposely infected the air of our laboratory with\r\nthe germinal dust of a sapless kind of hay mown in 1875.  Ten groups\r\nof flasks were charged with turnip infusion prepared in the infected\r\nlaboratory, and were afterwards subjected to the boiling temperature\r\nfor periods varying from 15 minutes to 240 minutes.  Out of the ten\r\ngroups only one was sterilised--that, namely, which had been boiled\r\nfor four hours.  Every flask of the nine groups which had been boiled\r\nfor 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, and 180 minutes respectively,\r\nbred organisms afterwards.  The same is true of other vegetable\r\ninfusions.  On the 28th of February last, for example, I boiled six\r\nflasks, containing cucumber infusion prepared in an infected\r\natmosphere, for periods of 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Every\r\nflask of the group subsequently developed organisms.  On the same day,\r\nin the case of three flasks, the boiling was prolonged to 240, 300,\r\nand 360 minutes; and these three flasks were completely sterilised.\r\nAnimal infusions, which under ordinary circumstances are rendered\r\ninfallibly barren by five minutes' boiling, behave like the vegetable\r\ninfusions in an atmosphere infected with hay-germs.  On the 30th of\r\nMarch, for example, five flasks were charged with a clear infusion of\r\nbeef and boiled for 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 180 minutes, 240 minutes,\r\nand 300 minutes respectively.  Every one of them became subsequently\r\ncrowded with organisms, and the same happened to a perfectly pellucid\r\nmutton infusion prepared at the same time.  The cases are to be\r\nnumbered by hundreds in which similar powers of resistance were\r\nmanifested by infusions of the most diverse kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of such facts I would ask my colleague whether it is\r\nnecessary to dwell for a single instant on the one-sidedness of the\r\nevidence which led the conclusion that all living matter has its life\r\ndestroyed by 'the briefest exposure to the influence of boiling\r\nwater.' An infusion proved to be barren by six months' exposure to\r\nmoteless air maintained at a temperature of 90° Fahr, when inoculated\r\nwith full-grown active bacteria, fills itself in two days with\r\norganisms so sensitive as to be killed by a few minutes' exposure to a\r\ntemperature much below that of boiling water.  But the extension of\r\nthis result to the desiccated germinal matter of the air is without\r\nwarrant or justification.  This is obvious without going beyond the\r\nargument itself.  But we have gone far beyond the argument, and proved\r\nby multiplied experiment the alleged destruction of all living matter\r\nby the briefest exposure to the influence of boiling water to be a\r\ndefusion.  The whole logical edifice raised upon this basis falls\r\ntherefore to the ground; and the argument that bacteria and their\r\ngerms, being destroyed at 140°, must, if they appear after exposure to\r\n212°, be spontaneously generated, is, I trust, silenced for ever.\r\n\r\nThrough the precautions, variations, and repetitions observed and\r\nexecuted with the view of rendering its results secure, the separate\r\nvessels employed in this enquiry have mounted up in two years to\r\nnearly ten thousand.\r\n\r\nBesides the philosophic interest attaching to the problem of life's\r\norigin, which will be always immense, there are the practical\r\ninterests involved in the application of the doctrines here discussed\r\nto surgery and medicine.  The antiseptic system, at which I have\r\nalready glanced, illustrates the manner in which beneficent results of\r\nthe gravest moment follow in the wake of clear theoretic insight.\r\nSurgery was once a noble art; it is now, as well, a noble science.\r\nPrior to the introduction of the antiseptic system, the thoughtful\r\nsurgeon could not have failed to learn empirically that there was\r\nsomething in the air which often defeated the most consummate\r\noperative skill.  That something the antiseptic treatment destroys or\r\nrenders innocuous.  At King's College Mr. Lister operates and dresses\r\nwhile a fine shower of mixed carbolic acid and water, produced in the\r\nsimplest manner, falls upon the wound, the lint and gauze employed in\r\nthe subsequent dressing being duly saturated with the antiseptic.  At\r\nSt. Bartholomew's Mr. Callender employs the dilute carbolic acid\r\nwithout the spray; but, as regards the real point aimed at--the\r\npreventing of the wound from becoming a nidus for the propagation of\r\nseptic bacteria--the practice in both hospitals is the same.\r\nCommending itself as it does to the scientifically trained mind, the\r\nantiseptic system has struck deep root in Germany.\r\n\r\nHad space allowed, it would have given me pleasure to point out the\r\npresent position of the 'germ theory' in reference to the phenomena of\r\ninfectious disease, distinguishing arguments based on analogy--which,\r\nhowever, are terribly strong--from those based on actual observation.\r\nI should have liked to follow up the account I have already given\r\n[Footnote: 'Fortnightly Review,' November 1876, see article\r\n'Fermentation.'] of the truly excellent researches of a young and an\r\nunknown German physician named Koch, on splenic fever, by an account\r\nof what Pasteur has recently done with reference to the same subject.\r\nHere we have before us a living _contagium_ of the most deadly power,\r\nwhich we can follow from the beginning to the end of its life cycle.\r\n[Footnote: Dallinger and Drysdale had previously shown what skill and\r\npatience can accomplish, by their admirable observations on the life\r\nhistory of the monads.]  We find it in the blood or spleen of a\r\nsmitten animal in the state say of short motionless rods.  When these\r\nrods are placed in a nutritive liquid on the warm stage of the\r\nmicroscope, we soon see them lengthening into filaments which lie, in\r\nsome cases, side by side, forming in others graceful loops, or\r\nbecoming coiled into knots of a complexity not to be unravelled.  We\r\nfinally see those filaments resolving themselves into innumerable\r\nspores, each with death potentially housed within it, yet not to be\r\ndistinguished microscopically from the harmless germs of Bacillus\r\nsubtilis.  The bacterium of splenic fever is called Bacillus\r\nAnthracis.  This formidable organism was shown to me by M. Pasteur in\r\nParis last July.  His recent investigations regarding the part it\r\nplays pathologically certainly rank amongst the most remarkable\r\nlabours of that remarkable man.  Observer after observer had strayed\r\nand fallen in this land of pitfalls, a multitude of opposing\r\nconclusions and mutually destructive theories being the result.  In\r\nassociation with a younger physiological colleague, M. Joubert,\r\nPasteur struck in amidst the chaos, and soon reduced it to harmony.\r\nThey proved, among other things, that in cases where previous\r\nobservers in France had supposed themselves to be dealing solely with\r\nsplenic fever, another equally virulent factor was simultaneously\r\nactive.  Splenic fever was often overmastered by septicaemia, and\r\nresults due solely to the latter had been frequently made the ground\r\nof pathological inferences regarding the character and cause of the\r\nformer.  Combining duly the two factors, all the previous\r\nirregularities disappeared, every result obtained receiving the\r\nfullest explanation.  On studying the account of this masterly\r\ninvestigation, the words wherewith Pasteur himself feelingly alludes\r\nto the difficulties and dangers of the experimenter's art came home to\r\nme with especial force: 'J'ai tant de fois éprouvé que dans cet art\r\ndifficile de l'expérimentation les plus habiles bronchent à chaque\r\npas, et que l'interprétation des faits nest pas moins périlleuse.'\r\n[Footnote: Comptes-Rendus,' lxxxiii. p. 177.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXIV  SCIENCE AND MAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Presidential Address, delivered before the Birmingham and\r\nMidland Institute, October 1877; with additions.]\r\n\r\nA MAGNET attracts iron; but when we analyse the effect we learn that\r\nthe metal is not only attracted but repelled, the final approach to\r\nthe magnet being due to the difference of two unequal and opposing\r\nforces.  Social progress is for the most part typified by this duplex\r\nor polar action.  As a general rule, every advance is balanced by a\r\npartial retreat, every amelioration is associated more or less with\r\ndeterioration.  No great mechanical improvement, for example, is\r\nintroduced for the benefit of society at large that does not bear\r\nhardly upon individuals.  Science, like other things, is subject to\r\nthe operation of this polar law, what is good for it under one aspect\r\nbeing bad for it under another.\r\n\r\nScience demands above all things personal concentration.  Its home is\r\nthe study of the mathematician, the quiet laboratory of the\r\nexperimenter, and the cabinet of the meditative observer of nature.\r\nDifferent atmospheres are required by the man of science, as such, and\r\nthe man of action.  Thus the facilities of social and international\r\nintercourse, the railway, the telegraph, and the post-office, which\r\nare such undoubted boons to the man of action, react to some extent\r\ninjuriously on the man of science.  Their tendency is to break up that\r\nconcentrativeness which, as I have said, is an absolute necessity to\r\nthe scientific investigator.\r\n\r\nThe men who have most profoundly influenced the world from the\r\nscientific side have habitually sought isolation.  Faraday, at a\r\ncertain period of his career, formally renounced dining out.  Darwin\r\nlives apart from the bustle of the world in his quiet home in Kent.\r\nMayer and Joule dealt in unobtrusive retirement with the weightiest\r\nscientific questions.  There is, however, one motive power in the\r\nworld which no man, be he a scientific student or otherwise, can\r\nafford to treat with indifference; and that is, the cultivation of\r\nright relations with his fellow-men--the performance of his duty, not\r\nas an isolated individual, but as a member of society.  It is duty in\r\nthis aspect, overcoming alike the sense of possible danger and the\r\ndesire for repose, that has placed me in your presence here to-night.\r\n\r\nTo look at his picture as a whole, a painter requires distance; and to\r\njudge of the total scientific achievement of any age, the standpoint\r\nof a succeeding age is desirable.  We may, however, transport\r\nourselves in idea into the future, and thus survey with more or less\r\ncompleteness the science of our time.  We sometimes hear it decried,\r\nand contrasted to its disadvantage with the science of other times.  I\r\ndo not think that this will be the verdict of posterity.  I think, on\r\nthe contrary, that posterity will acknowledge that in the history of\r\nscience no higher samples of intellectual conquest are recorded than\r\nthose which this age has made its own.  One of the most salient of\r\nthese I propose, with your permission, to make the subject of our\r\nconsideration during the coming hour.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that the man of to-day is the child and\r\nproduct of incalculable antecedent time.  His physical and\r\nintellectual textures have been woven for him during his passage\r\nthrough phases of history and forms of existence which lead the mind\r\nback to an abysmal past. One of the qualities which he has derived\r\nfrom that past is the yearning to let in the light of principles on\r\nthe otherwise bewildering flux of phenomena.  He has been described by\r\nthe German Lichtenberg as 'das rastlose Ursachenthier'--the restless\r\ncause-seeking animal--in whom facts excite a kind of hunger to know\r\nthe sources from which they spring.  Never, I venture to say, in the\r\nhistory of the world has this longing been more liberally responded\r\nto, both among men of science and the general public, than during the\r\nlast thirty or forty years.  I say 'the general public,' because it is\r\na feature of our time that the man of science no longer limits his\r\nlabours to the society of his colleagues and his peers, but shares, as\r\nfar as it is possible to share, with the world at large the fruits of\r\nenquiry.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Robert Boyle regarded the universe as a machine; Mr.\r\nCarlyle prefers regarding it as a tree.  He loves the image of the\r\numbrageous Igdrasil better than that of the Strasburg clock.  A\r\nmachine may be defined as an organism with life and direction outside;\r\na tree may be defined as an organism with life and direction within.\r\nIn the light of these definitions, I close with the conception of\r\nCarlyle.  The order and energy of the universe I hold to be inherent,\r\nand not imposed from without, the expression of fixed law and not of\r\narbitrary will, exercised by what Carlyle would call an Almighty\r\nClockmaker.  But the two conceptions are not so much opposed to each\r\nother after all.  In one fundamental particular they at all events\r\nagree.  They equally imply the interdependence and harmonious\r\ninteraction of parts, and the subordination of the individual powers\r\nof the universal organism to the working of the whole.\r\n\r\nNever were the harmony and interdependence just referred to so clearly\r\nrecognised as now.  Our insight regarding them is not that vague and\r\ngeneral insight to which our fathers had attained, and which, in early\r\ntimes, was more frequently affirmed by the synthetic poet than by the\r\nscientific man.  The interdependence of our day has become\r\nquantitative--expressible by numbers--leading, it must be added,\r\ndirectly into that inexorable reign of law which so many gentle people\r\nregard with dread.  In the domain now under review men of science had\r\nfirst to work their way from darkness into twilight, and from twilight\r\ninto day.  There is no solution of continuity in science.  It is not\r\ngiven to any man, however endowed, to rise spontaneously into\r\nintellectual splendour without the parentage of antecedent thought.\r\nGreat discoveries grow.  Here, as in other cases, we have first the\r\nseed, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear, the last member of\r\nthe series implying the first. Thus, as regards the discovery of\r\ngravitation with which the name of Newton is identified, notions more\r\nor less clear concerning it had entered many minds before Newton's\r\ntranscendent mathematical genius raised it to the level of a\r\ndemonstration.  The whole of his deductions, moreover, rested upon the\r\ninductions of Kepler.  Newton shot beyond his predecessors; but his\r\nthoughts were rooted in their thoughts, and a just distribution of\r\nmerit would assign to them a fair portion of the honour of discovery.\r\n\r\nScientific theories sometimes float like rumours in the air before\r\nthey receive complete expression.  The doom of a doctrine is often\r\npractically sealed, and the truth of one is often practically\r\naccepted, long prior to the demonstration of either the error or the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nPerpetual motion was discarded before it was proved to be opposed to\r\nnatural law; and, as regards the connection and interaction of natural\r\nforces, intimations of modern discoveries are strewn through the\r\nwritings of Leibnitz, Boyle, Hooke, Locke and others.\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves to recent times, Dr. Ingleby has pointed out to me\r\nsome singularly sagacious remarks bearing upon this question, which\r\nwere published by: an anonymous writer in 1820.  Roget's penetration\r\nwas conspicuous in 1829.  Mohr had grasped in 1837 some deep-lying\r\ntruth.  The writings of Faraday furnish frequent illustrations of his\r\nprofound belief in he unity of nature.  'I have long,' he writes in\r\n1845, 'held an opinion almost amounting to conviction, in common, I\r\nbelieve, with other lovers of natural knowledge, that the various\r\nforms under which the forces of matter are made manifest have one\r\ncommon origin, or, in other words, are so directly related and\r\nmutually dependent, that they are convertible, as it were, one into\r\nanother, and possess equivalence of power in their action.'  His own\r\nresearches on magneto-electricity, on electro-chemistry, and on the\r\n'magnetisation of light led him directly to this belief.  At an early\r\ndate Mr. Justice Grove made his mark upon this question.  Colding,\r\nthough starting from a metaphysical basis, grasped eventually the\r\nrelation between heat and mechanical work, and sought to determine it\r\nexperimentally.  And here let me say, that to him who has only the\r\ntruth at heart, and who in his dealings with scientific history keeps\r\nhis soul unwarped by envy, hatred, or malice, personal or national,\r\nevery fresh accession to historic knowledge must be welcome.  For\r\nevery new-comer of proved merit, more especially if that merit should\r\nhave been previously overlooked, he makes ready room in his\r\nrecognition or his reverence.  But no retrospect of scientific\r\nliterature has as yet brought to light a claim which can sensibly\r\naffect the positions accorded to two great Path-hewers, as the Germans\r\ncall them, whose names in relation to this subject are linked in\r\nindissoluble association.  These names are Julius Robert Mayer and\r\nJames Prescott Joule.\r\n\r\nIn his essay on 'Circles' Mr. Emerson, if I remember rightly,\r\npictured intellectual progress as rhythmic.  At a given moment\r\nknowledge is surrounded by a barrier which marks its limit.  It\r\ngradually gathers clearness and strength until by-and-by some thinker\r\nof exceptional power bursts the barrier and wins a wider circle,\r\nwithin which thought once more entrenches itself.  But the internal\r\nforce again accumulates, the new barrier is in its turn broken, and\r\nthe mind finds itself surrounded by a still wider horizon.  Thus,\r\naccording to Emerson, knowledge spreads by intermittent victories\r\ninstead of progressing at a uniform rate.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Joule first proved that a weight of one pound, falling\r\nthrough a height of seven hundred and seventy-two feet, generated an\r\namount of heat competent to warm a pound of water one degree\r\nFahrenheit, and that in lifting the weight so much heat exactly\r\ndisappeared, he broke an Emersonian 'circle,' releasing by the act an\r\namount of scientific energy which rapidly overran a vast domain, and\r\nembodied itself in the great doctrine known as the 'Conservation of\r\nEnergy.' This doctrine recognises in the material universe a constant\r\nsum of power made up of items among which the most Protean\r\nfluctuations are incessantly going on.  It is as if the body of Nature\r\nwere alive, the thrill and interchange of its energies resembling\r\nthose of an organism.  The parts of the 'stupendous whole' shift and\r\nchange, augment and diminish, appear and disappear, while the total of\r\nwhich they are the parts remains quantitatively immutable.  Immutable,\r\nbecause when change occurs it is always polar--plus accompanies minus,\r\ngain accompanies loss, no item varying in the slightest degree without\r\nan absolutely equal change of some other item in the opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe sun warms the tropical ocean, converting a portion of its liquid\r\ninto vapour, which rises in the air and is recondensed on mountain\r\nheights, returning in rivers to the ocean from which it came.  Up to\r\nthe point where condensation begins, an amount of heat exactly\r\nequivalent to the molecular work of vaporisation and the mechanical\r\nwork of lifting the vapour to the mountain-tops has disappeared from\r\nthe universe.  What is the gain corresponding to this loss?  It will\r\nseem when mentioned to be expressed in a foreign currency.  The loss\r\nis a loss of heat; the gain is a gain of distance, both as regards\r\nmasses and molecules.  Water which was formerly at the sea-level has\r\nbeen lifted to a position from which it can fall; molecules which have\r\nbeen locked together as a liquid are now separate as vapour which can\r\nrecondense.  After condensation gravity comes into effectual play,\r\npulling the showers down upon the hills, and the rivers thus created\r\nthrough their gorges to the sea.  Every raindrop which smites the\r\nmountain produces its definite amount of heat; every river in its\r\ncourse develops heat by the clash of its cataracts and the friction of\r\nits bed.  In the act of condensation, moreover, the molecular work of\r\nvaporisation is accurately reversed.  'Compare, then, the primitive\r\nloss of solar warmth with the heat generated by the condensation of\r\nthe vapour, and by the subsequent fall of the water from cloud to sea.\r\nThey are mathematically equal to each other.  No particle of vapour\r\nwas formed and lifted without being paid for in the currency of solar\r\nheat; no particle returns as water to the sea without the exact\r\nquantitative restitution of that heat.  There is nothing gratuitous in\r\nphysical nature, no expenditure without equivalent gain, no gain\r\nwithout equivalent expenditure.  With inexorable constancy the one\r\naccompanies the other, leaving no nook or crevice between them for\r\nspontaneity to mingle with the pure and necessary play of natural\r\nforce.  Has this uniformity of nature ever been broken?  The reply is:\r\n\r\n'Not to the knowledge of science.'\r\n\r\nWhat has been here stated regarding heat and gravity applies to the\r\nwhole of inorganic nature.  Let us take an illustration from\r\nchemistry.  The metal zinc may be burnt in oxygen, a perfectly\r\ndefinite amount of heat being produced by the combustion of a given\r\nweight of the metal.  But zinc may also be burnt in a liquid which\r\ncontains a supply of oxygen--in water, for example.  It does not in\r\nthis case produce flame or fire, but it does produce heat which is\r\ncapable of accurate measurement.  But the heat of zinc burnt in water\r\nfalls short of that produced in pure oxygen, the reason being that to\r\nobtain its oxygen from the water the zinc must first dislodge the\r\nhydrogen.  It is in the performance of this molecular work that the\r\nmissing heat is absorbed.  Mix the liberated hydrogen with oxygen and\r\ncause them to recombine; the heat developed is mathematically equal to\r\nthe missing heat.  Thus in pulling the oxygen and hydrogen asunder an\r\namount of heat is consumed which is accurately restored by their\r\nreunion.\r\n\r\nThis leads up to a few remarks upon the Voltaic battery.  It is not my\r\ndesign to dwell upon the technical features of this wonderful\r\ninstrument, but simply, by means of it, to show what varying shapes a\r\ngiven amount of energy can assume while maintaining unvarying\r\nquantitative stability.  When that form of power which we call an\r\nelectric current passes through Grove's battery, zinc is consumed in\r\nacidulated water; and in the battery we are able so to arrange matters\r\nthat when no current passes no zinc shall be consumed.  Now the\r\ncurrent, whatever it may be, possesses the power of generating heat\r\noutside the battery.  We can fuse with it iridium, the most refractory\r\nof metals, or we can produce with it the dazzling electric light, and\r\nthat at any terrestrial distance from the battery itself.\r\n\r\nWe will now, however, content ourselves with causing the current to\r\nraise a given length of platinum wire, first to a blood-heat, then to\r\nredness, and finally to a white heat.  The heat under these\r\ncircumstances generated in the battery by the combustion of a fixed\r\nquantity of zinc is no longer constant, but it varies inversely as the\r\nheat generated outside.  If the outside heat be nil, the inside heat\r\nis a maximum; if the external wire be raised to a blood-heat, the\r\ninternal heat falls slightly short of the maximum.  If the wire be\r\nrendered red-hot, the quantity of missing heat within the battery is\r\ngreater, and if the external wire be rendered white-hot, the defect is\r\ngreater still.  Add together the internal and external heat produced\r\nby the combustion of a given weight of zinc, and you have an\r\nabsolutely constant total.  The heat generated without is so much lost\r\nwithin, the heat generated within is so much lost without, the polar\r\nchanges already adverted to coming here conspicuously into play.  Thus\r\nin a variety of ways we can distribute the items of a never-varying\r\nsum, but even the subtle agency of the electric current places no\r\ncreative power in our hands.\r\n\r\nInstead of generating external heat, we may cause the current to\r\neffect chemical decomposition at a distance from the battery.  Let it,\r\nfor example, decompose water into oxygen and hydrogen.  The heat\r\ngenerated in the battery under these circumstances by the combustion\r\nof a given weight of zinc falls short of what is produced when there\r\nis no decomposition.  How far short?  The question admits of a\r\nperfectly exact answer.  When the oxygen and hydrogen recombine, the\r\nheat absorbed in the decomposition is accurately restored, and it is\r\nexactly equal in amount to that missing in the battery.  We may, if we\r\nlike, bottle up the gases, carry in this form the heat of the battery\r\nto the polar regions, and liberate it there.  The battery, in fact is\r\na hearth on which fuel is consumed; but the heat of the combustion,\r\ninstead of being confined in the usual manner to the hearth itself,\r\nmay be first liberated at the other side of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd here we are able to solve an enigma which long perplexed\r\nscientific men, and which could not be solved until the bearing of the\r\nmechanical theory of heat upon the phenomena of the Voltaic battery\r\nwas understood.  The puzzle was, that a single cell could not\r\ndecompose water.  The reason is now plain enough.  The solution of an\r\nequivalent of zinc in a single cell develops not much more than half\r\nthe amount of heat required to decompose an equivalent of water, and\r\nthe single cell cannot cede an amount of force which it does not\r\npossess.  But by forming a battery of two cells instead of one, we\r\ndevelop an amount of heat slightly in excess of that needed for the\r\ndecomposition of the water.  The two-celled battery is therefore rich\r\nenough to pay for that decomposition, and to maintain the excess\r\nreferred to within its own cells.\r\n\r\nSimilar reflections apply to the thermo-electric pile, an instrument\r\nusually composed of small bars of bismuth and antimony soldered\r\nalternately together.  The electric current is here evoked by warming\r\nthe soldered junctions of one face of the pile.  Like the Voltaic\r\ncurrent, the thermo-electric current can heat wires, produce\r\ndecomposition, magnetise iron, and deflect a magnetic needle at any\r\ndistance from its origin.  You will be disposed, and rightly disposed,\r\nto refer those distant manifestations of power to the heat\r\ncommunicated to the face of the pile, but the case is worthy of closer\r\nexamination.  In 1826 Thomas Seebeck discovered thermo-electricity,\r\nand six years subsequently Peltier made an observation which comes\r\nwith singular felicity to our aid in determining the material used up\r\nin the formation of the thermo-electric current.  He found that when a\r\nweak extraneous current was sent from antimony to bismuth the junction\r\nof the two metals was always heated, but that when the direction was\r\nfrom bismuth to antimony the junction was chilled.  Now the current in\r\nthe thermo-pile itself is always from bismuth to antimony, across the\r\nheated junction--a direction in which it cannot possibly establish\r\nitself without consuming the heat imparted to the junction.  This heat\r\nis the nutriment of the current.  Thus the heat generated by the\r\nthermo-current in a distant wire is simply that originally imparted to\r\nthe pile, which has been first transmuted into electricity, and then\r\nretransmuted into its first form at a distance from its origin.  As\r\nwater in a state of vapour passes from a boiler to a distant\r\ncondenser, and there assumes its primitive form without gain or loss,\r\nso the heat communicated to the thermo-pile distils into the subtler\r\nelectric current, which is, as it were, recondensed into heat in the\r\ndistant platinum wire.\r\n\r\nIn my youth I thought an electro-magnetic engine which was shown to me\r\na veritable perpetual motion--a machine, that is to say, which\r\nperformed work without the expenditure of power.  Let us consider the\r\naction of such a machine.  Suppose it to be employed to pump water\r\nfrom a lower to a higher level.  On examining the battery which works\r\nthe engine we find that the zinc consumed does not yield its full\r\namount of heat.  The quantity of heat thus missing within is the exact\r\nthermal equivalent of the mechanical work performed without.  Let the\r\nwater fall again to the lower level; it is warmed by the fall.  Add\r\nthe heat thus produced to that generated by the friction, mechanical\r\nand magnetical, of the engine; we thus obtain the precise amount of\r\nheat missing in the battery.  All the effects obtained from the\r\nmachine are thus strictly paid for; this 'payment for results' being,\r\nI would repeat, the inexorable method of nature.\r\n\r\nNo engine, however subtly devised, can evade this law of equivalence,\r\nor perform on its own account the smallest modicum of work.  The\r\nmachine distributes, but it cannot create.  Is the animal body, then,\r\nto be classed among machines?  When I lift a weight, or throw a stone,\r\nor climb a mountain, or wrestle with my comrade, am I not conscious of\r\nactually creating and expending force?  Let us look at the antecedents\r\nof this force.  We derive the muscle and fat of our bodies from what\r\nwe eat.  Animal heat you know to be due to the slow combustion of this\r\nfuel.  My arm is now inactive, and the ordinary slow combustion of my\r\nblood and tissue is going on.  For every grain of fuel thus burnt a\r\nperfectly definite amount of heat has been produced.  I now contract\r\nmy biceps muscle without causing it to perform external work.  The\r\ncombustion is quickened, and the heat is increased; this additional\r\nheat being liberated in the muscle itself.  I lay hold of a 56 lb.\r\nweight, and by the contraction of my biceps lift it through the\r\nvertical space of a foot.  The blood and tissue consumed during this\r\ncontraction have not developed in the muscle their due amount of heat.\r\nA quantity of heat is at this moment missing in my muscle which would\r\nraise the temperature of an ounce of water somewhat more than one\r\ndegree Fahrenheit.  I liberate the weight: it falls to the earth, and\r\nby its collision generates the precise amount of heat missing in the\r\nmuscle.  My muscular heat is thus transferred from its local hearth to\r\nexternal space.  The fuel is consumed in my body, but the heat of\r\ncombustion is produced outside my body.  The case is substantially the\r\nsame as that of the Voltaic battery when it performs external work, or\r\nproduces external heat.  All this points to the conclusion that the\r\nforce we employ in muscular exertion is the force of burning fuel and\r\nnot of creative will.  In the light of these facts the body is seen to\r\nbe as incapable of generating energy without expenditure, as the\r\nsolids and liquids of the Voltaic battery.  The body, in other words,\r\nfalls into the catagory of machines.\r\n\r\nWe can do with the body all that we have already done with the\r\nbattery--heat platinum wires, decompose water, magnetise iron, and\r\ndeflect a magnetic needle.  The combustion of muscle may be made to\r\nproduce all these effects, as the combustion of zinc may be caused to\r\nproduce them.  By turning the handle of a magneto-electric machine a\r\ncoil of wire may be caused to rotate between the poles of a magnet. As\r\nlong as the two ends of the coil are unconnected we have simply to\r\novercome the ordinary inertia and friction of the machine in turning\r\nthe handle.  But the moment the two ends of the coil are united by a\r\nthin platinum wire a sudden addition of labour is thrown upon the\r\nturning arm.  When the necessary labour is expended, its equivalent\r\nimmediately appears.  The platinum wire glows.  You can readily\r\nmaintain it at a white heat, or even fuse it.  This is a very\r\nremarkable result.  From the muscles of the arm, with a temperature of\r\n100 degrees, we extract the temperature of molten platinum, which is\r\nnearly four thousand degrees.  The miracle here is the reverse of that\r\nof the burning bush mentioned in Exodus.  There the bush burned, but\r\nwas not consumed--here the body is consumed, but does not burn.  The\r\nsimilarity of the action with that of the Voltaic battery when it\r\nheats an external wire is too obvious to need pointing out.  When the\r\nmachine is used to decompose water, the heat of the muscle, like that\r\nof the battery, is consumed in molecular work, being fully restored\r\nwhen the gases recombine.  As before, also, the transmuted heat of\r\nthe muscles may be bottled up, carried to the polar regions, and there\r\nrestored to its pristine form.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe matter of the human body is the same as that of the world around\r\nus; and here we find the forces of the human body identical with those\r\nof inorganic nature.  Just as little as the Voltaic battery is the\r\nanimal body a creator of force.  It is an apparatus exquisite and\r\neffectual beyond all others in transforming and distributing the\r\nenergy with which it is supplied, but it possesses no creative power.\r\nCompared with the notions previously entertained regarding the play of\r\n'Vital force' this is a great result.  The problem of vital dynamics\r\nhas been described by a competent authority as 'the grandest of all.'\r\nI subscribe to this opinion, and honour correspondingly the man who\r\nfirst successfully grappled with the problem.  He was no pope, in the\r\nsense of being infallible, but he was a man of genius whose work will\r\nbe held in honour as long as science endures I have already named him\r\nin connection with our illustrious countryman Dr. Joule.  Other\r\neminent men took up this subject subsequently and independently, but\r\nall that has been done hitherto enhances instead of diminishing the\r\nmerits of Dr. Mayer.\r\n\r\nConsider the vigour of his reasoning.  'Beyond the power of generating\r\ninternal heat, the animal organism can generate heat external to\r\nitself.  A blacksmith by hammering can warm a nail, and a savage by\r\nfriction can heat wood to its point of ignition.  Unless, then, we\r\nabandon the physiological axiom that the animal body cannot create\r\nheat out of nothing, we are driven to the conclusion that it is the\r\ntotal heat, within and without, that ought to be regarded as the real\r\ncalorific effect of the oxidation within the body.'  Mayer, however,\r\nnot only states the principle, but illustrates numerically the\r\ntransfer of muscular heat to external space.  A bowler who imparts a\r\nvelocity of 30 feet to an 8-lb.  ball consumes in the act 0.1 of a\r\ngrain of carbon.  The heat of the muscle is here distributed over the\r\ntrack of the ball, being developed there by mechanical friction.  A\r\nman weighing 150 lbs. consumes in lifting his own body to a height of\r\n8 feet the heat of a grain of carbon.  Jumping from this height the\r\nheat is restored.  The consumption of 2 oz. 4 drs.  20 grs.  of carbon\r\nwould place the same man on the summit of a mountain 10,000 feet high.\r\nIn descending the mountain an amount of heat equal to that produced by\r\nthe combustion of the foregoing amount of carbon is restored.  The\r\nmuscles of a labourer whose weight is 150 lbs. weigh 64 lbs. When\r\ndried they are reduced to 15 lbs. Were the oxidation corresponding to\r\na day-labourer's ordinary work exerted on the muscles alone, they\r\nwould be wholly consumed in 80 days.  Were the oxidation necessary to\r\nsustain the heart's action concentrated on the heart itself, it would\r\nbe consumed in 8 days.  And if we confine our attention to the two\r\nventricles, their action would consume the associated muscular tissue\r\nin 31 days.  With a fulness and precision of which this is but a\r\nsample did Mayer, between 1842 and, 1845, deal with the great question\r\nof vital dynamics.\r\n\r\nIn direct opposition, moreover, to the foremost scientific authorities\r\nof that day, with Liebig at their head, this solitary Heilbronn worker\r\nwas led by his calculations to maintain that the muscles, in the main,\r\nplayed the part of machinery, converting the fat, which had been\r\npreviously considered a mere heat-producer, into the motive power of\r\nthe organism.  Mayer's prevision has been justified by events, for the\r\nscientific world is now upon his side.\r\n\r\nWe place, then, food in our stomachs as so much combustible matter. It\r\nis first dissolved by purely chemical processes, and the nutritive\r\nfluid is poured into the blood.  Here it comes into contact with\r\natmospheric oxygen admitted by the lungs.  It unites with the oxygen\r\nas wood or coal might unite with it in a furnace.  The matter-products\r\nof the union, if I may use the term, are the same in both cases, viz.\r\ncarbonic acid and water.  The force-products are also the same--heat\r\nwithin the body, or heat and work outside the body.  Thus far every\r\naction of the organism belongs to the domain either of physics or of\r\nchemistry.  But you saw me contract the muscle of my arm.  What\r\nenabled me to do, so?  Was it or was it not the direct action of my\r\nwill?  The answer is, the action of the will is mediate, not direct.\r\nOver and above the muscles the human organism is provided with long\r\nwhitish filaments of medullary matter, which issue from the spinal\r\ncolumn, being connected by it on the one side with the brain, and on\r\nthe other side losing themselves in the muscles.  Those filaments or\r\ncords are the nerves, which you know are divided into two kinds,\r\nsensor and motor, or, if you like the terms better, afferent and\r\nefferent nerves.  The former carry impressions from the external world\r\nto the brain; the latter convey the behests of the brain to the\r\nmuscles.  Here, as elsewhere, we find ourselves aided by the sagacity\r\nof Mayer, who was the first clearly to formulate the part played by\r\nthe nerves in the organism.  Mayer saw that neither nerves nor brain,\r\nnor both together, possessed the energy necessary to animal motion;\r\nbut he also saw that the nerve could lift a latch and open a door, by\r\nwhich floods of energy are let loose. 'As an engineer,' he says with\r\nadmirable lucidity, 'by the motion of his finger in opening a valve or\r\nloosening a detent can liberate an amount of mechanical energy almost\r\ninfinite compared with its exciting cause; so the nerves, acting on\r\nthe muscles, can unlock an amount of power out of all proportion to\r\nthe work done by the nerves themselves.'  The nerves, according to\r\nMayer, pull the trigger, but the gunpowder which they ignite is stored\r\nin the muscles.  This is the view now universally entertained.\r\n\r\nThe quickness of thought has passed into a proverb, and the notion\r\nthat any measurable time elapsed between the infliction of a wound and\r\nthe feeling of the injury would have been rejected as preposterous\r\nthirty years ago.  Nervous impressions, notwithstanding the results of\r\nHaller, were thought to be transmitted, if not instantaneously, at all\r\nevents with the rapidity of electricity.  Hence, when Helmholtz, in\r\n1851, affirmed, as the result of experiment, nervous transmission to\r\nbe a comparatively sluggish process, very few believed him.  His\r\nexperiments may now be made in the lecture-room.\r\n\r\nSound in air moves at the rate of 1,100 feet a second; sound in water\r\nmoves at the rate of 5,000 feet a second; light in aether moves at the\r\nrate of 186,000 miles a second, and electricity in free wires moves\r\nprobably at the same rate.  But the nerves transmit their messages at\r\nthe rate of only 70 feet a second, a progress which in these quick\r\ntimes might well be regarded as inordinately slow.\r\n\r\nYour townsman, Mr. Gore, has produced by electrolysis a kind of\r\nantimony which exhibits an action strikingly analogous to that of\r\nnervous propagation.  A rod of this antimony is in such a molecular\r\ncondition that when you scratch or heat one end of the rod, the\r\ndisturbance propagates itself before your eyes to the other end, the\r\nonward march of the disturbance being announced by the development of\r\nheat and fumes along the line of propagation.  In some such way the\r\nmolecules of the nerves are successively overthrown; and if Mr. Gore\r\ncould only devise some means of winding up his exhausted antimony, as\r\nthe nutritive blood winds up exhausted nerves, the comparison would be\r\ncomplete.  The subject may be summed up, as Du Bois-Reymond has summed\r\nit up, by reference to the case of a whale struck by a harpoon in the\r\ntail.  If the animal were 70 feet long, a second would elapse before\r\nthe disturbance could reach the brain.  But the impression after its\r\narrival has to diffuse itself and throw the brain into the molecular\r\ncondition necessary to consciousness.  Then, and not till then, the\r\ncommand to the tail to defend itself is shot through the motor nerves.\r\nAnother second must elapse before the command can reach the tail, so\r\nthat more than two seconds transpire between the infliction of the\r\nwound and the muscular response of the part wounded.  The interval\r\nrequired for the kindling of consciousness would probably more than\r\nsuffice for the destruction of the brain by lightning, or even by a\r\nrifle-bullet.  Before the organ can arrange itself it may, therefore,\r\nbe destroyed, and in such a case we may safely conclude that death is\r\npainless.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe experiences of common life supply us with copious instances of the\r\nliberation of vast stores of muscular power by an infinitesimal\r\n'priming' of the muscles by the nerves.  We all know the effect\r\nproduced on a 'nervous' organisation by a slight sound which causes\r\naffright.  An aërial wave, the energy of which would not reach a\r\nminute fraction of that necessary to raise the thousandth of a grain\r\nthrough the thousandth of an inch, can throw the whole human frame\r\ninto a powerful mechanical spasm, followed by violent respiration and\r\npalpitation.  The eye of course, may be appealed to as well as the\r\near.  Of this the lamented Lange gives the following vivid\r\nillustration:\r\n\r\nA merchant sits complacently in his easy chair, not knowing whether\r\nsmoking, sleeping, newspaper reading, or the digestion of food\r\noccupies the largest portion of his personality.  A servant enters the\r\nroom with a telegram bearing the words, 'Antwerp, &c...  Jonas\r\nand Co.  have failed.' 'Tell James to harness the horses!' The servant\r\nflies.  Upstairs the merchant, wide awake; makes a dozen paces through\r\nthe room, descends to the counting-house, dictates letters, and\r\nforwards despatches.  He jumps into his carriage, the horses snort,\r\nand their driver is immediately at the Bank, on the Bourse, and among\r\nhis commercial friends.  Before an hour has elapsed he is again at\r\nhome, where he throws himself once more into his easy chair with a\r\ndeep-drawn sigh, 'Thank God I am protected against the worst, and now\r\nfor further reflection.'\r\n\r\nThis complex mass of action, emotional, intellectual, and mechanical,\r\nis evoked by the impact upon the retina of the infinitesimal waves of\r\nlight coming from a few pencil marks on a bit of paper.  We have, as\r\nLange says, terror, hope, sensation, calculation, possible ruin, and\r\nvictory compressed into a moment.  What caused the merchant to spring\r\nout of his chair?  The contraction of his muscles.  What made his\r\nmuscles contract?  An impulse of the nerves, which lifted the proper\r\nlatch, and liberated the muscular power.  Whence this impulse?  From\r\nthe centre of the nervous system.  But how did it originate there?\r\nThis is the critical question, to which some will reply that it had\r\nits origin in the human soul.\r\n\r\nThe aim and effort of science is to explain the unknown in terms of\r\nthe known.  Explanation, therefore, is conditioned by knowledge.  You\r\nhave probably heard the story of the German peasant, who, in early\r\nrailway days, was taken to see the performance of a locomotive.  He\r\nhad never known carriages to be moved except by animal power.  Every\r\nexplanation outside of this conception lay beyond his experience, and\r\ncould not be invoked.  After long reflection therefore, and seeing no\r\npossible escape from the conclusion, he exclaimed confidently to his\r\ncompanion, 'Es muessen doch Pferde darin sein '--There must be horses\r\ninside.  Amusing as this locomotive theory may seem, it illustrates a\r\ndeep-lying truth.\r\n\r\nWith reference to our present question, some may be disposed to press\r\nupon me such considerations as these: Your motor nerves are so many\r\nspeaking-tubes, through which messages are sent from the man to the\r\nworld; and your sensor nerves are so many conduits through which the\r\nwhispers of the world are sent back to the man.  But you have not told\r\nus where is the man.  Who or what is it that sends and receives those\r\nmessages through the bodily organism?  Do not the phenomena point to\r\nthe existence of a self within the self, which acts through the body\r\nas through a skilfully constructed instrument?  You picture the\r\nmuscles as hearkening to the commands sent through the motor nerves,\r\nand you picture the sensor nerves as the vehicles of incoming\r\nintelligence; are you not bound to supplement this mechanism by the\r\nassumption of an entity which uses it?  In other words, are you not\r\nforced by Tour own exposition into the hypothesis of a free human\r\nsoul?\r\n\r\nThis is fair reasoning now, and at a certain stage of the world's\r\nknowledge, it might well have been deemed conclusive.  Adequate\r\nreflection, however, shows that instead of introducing light into our\r\nminds, this hypothesis considered scientifically increases our\r\ndarkness.  You do not in this case explain the unknown in terms of the\r\nknown, which, as stated above, is the method of science, but you\r\nexplain the unknown in terms of the more unknown.  Try to mentally\r\nvisualise this soul as an entity distinct from the body, and the\r\ndifficulty immediately appears.  From the side of science all that we\r\nare warranted in stating is that the terror, hope, sensation, and\r\ncalculation of Lange's merchant, are psychical phenomena produced by,\r\nor associated with, the molecular processes set up by waves of light\r\nin a previously prepared brain.\r\n\r\nWhen facts present themselves let us dare to face them, but let the\r\nman of science equally dare to confess ignorance where it prevails.\r\nWhat then is the causal connection, if any, between the objective and\r\nsubjective--between molecular motions and states of consciousness? My\r\nanswer is: I do not see the connection, nor have I as yet met anybody\r\nwho does.\r\n\r\nIt is no explanation to say that the objective and subjective effects\r\nare two sides of one and the same phenomenon.  Why should the\r\nphenomenon have two sides?  This is the very core of the difficulty.\r\nThere are plenty of molecular motions which do not exhibit this\r\ntwo-sidedness.  Does water think or feel when it runs into frost-ferns\r\nupon a window-pane?  If not, why should the molecular motion of the\r\nbrain be yoked to this mysterious companion--consciousness?  We can\r\nform a coherent picture of the physical processes--the stirring of the\r\nbrain, the thrilling of the nerves, the discharging of the muscles,\r\nand all the subsequent mechanical motions of the organism.  But we can\r\npresent to our minds no picture of the process whereby consciousness\r\nemerges, either as a necessary link or as an accidental by-product of\r\nthis series of actions.  Yet it certainly does emerge--the prick of a\r\npin suffices to prove that molecular motion can produce consciousness.\r\nThe reverse process of the production of motion by consciousness is\r\nequally unpresentable to the mind.  We are here, in fact, upon the\r\nboundary line of the intellect, where the ordinary canons of science\r\nfail to extricate us from our difficulties.  If we are true to these\r\ncanons, we must deny to subjective phenomena all influence on physical\r\nprocesses.  Observation proves that they interact, but in passing from\r\none to the other, we meet a blank which mechanical deduction is unable\r\nto fill.  Frankly stated, we have here to deal with facts almost as\r\ndifficult to seize mentally as the idea of a soul.  And if you are\r\ncontent to make your 'soul' a poetic rendering of a phenomenon which\r\nrefuses the yoke of ordinary physical laws, I, for one, would not\r\nobject to this exercise of ideality.  Amid all our speculative\r\nuncertainty, however, there is one practical point as clear as the\r\nday; namely, that the brightness and the usefulness of life, as well\r\nas its darkness and disaster, depend to a great extent upon our own\r\nuse or abuse of this miraculous organ.\r\n\r\nAccustomed as I am to harsh language, I am quite prepared to hear my\r\n'poetic rendering' branded as a 'falsehood' and a 'fib.' The\r\nvituperation is unmerited, for poetry or ideality, and untruth are\r\nassuredly very different things.  The one may vivify, while the other,\r\nkills.  When St. John extends the notion of a soul to 'souls washed\r\nin the blood of Christ' does he 'fib'?  Indeed, if the appeal to\r\nideality is censurable, Christ himself ought not to have escaped\r\ncensure.  Nor did he escape it. 'How can this man give us his flesh to\r\neat?' expressed the sceptical flouting of unpoetic natures.  Such are\r\nstill amongst us.  Cardinal Manning would doubtless tell any\r\nProtestant who rejects the doctrine of transubstantiation that he\r\n'fibs' away the plain words of his Saviour when he reduces 'the Body\r\nof the Lord' in the sacrament to a mere figure of speech.\r\n\r\nThough misuse may render it grotesque or insincere, the idealisation\r\nof ancient conceptions, when done consciously and above board, has, in\r\nmy opinion, an important future.  We are not radically different from\r\nour historic ancestors, and any feeling which affected them\r\nprofoundly, requires only appropriate clothing to affect us.  The\r\nworld will not lightly relinquish its heritage of poetic feeling, and\r\nmetaphysic will be welcomed when it abandons its pretensions to\r\nscientific discovery and consents to be ranked as a kind of poetry. 'A\r\ngood symbol,' says Emerson, 'is a missionary to persuade thousands.\r\nThe Vedas, the Edda, the Koran, are each remembered by its happiest\r\nfigure.  There is no more welcome gift to men than a new symbol.  They\r\nassimilate themselves to it, deal with it in all ways, and it will\r\nlast a hundred years.  Then comes a new genius and brings another.'\r\nOur ideas of God and the soul are obviously subject to this symbolic\r\nmutation.  They are not now what they were a century ago. They will\r\nnot be a century hence what they are now.  Such ideas constitute a\r\nkind of central energy in the human mind, capable, like the energy of\r\nthe physical universe, of assuming various shapes and undergoing\r\nvarious transformations.  They baffle and elude the theological\r\nmechanic who would carve them to dogmatic forms.  They offer\r\nthemselves freely to the poet who understands his vocation, and whose\r\nfunction is, or ought to be, to find 'local habitation' for thoughts\r\nwoven into our subjective life, but which refuse to be mechanically\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWe now stand face to face with the final problem.  It is this: Are the\r\nbrain, and the moral and intellectual processes known to be associated\r\nwith the brain--and, as far as our experience goes, indissolubly\r\nassociated--subject to the laws which we find paramount in physical\r\nnature?  Is the will of man, in other words, free, or are it and\r\nnature equally 'bound fast in fate'?  From this latter conclusion,\r\nafter he had established it to the entire satisfaction of his\r\nunderstanding, the great German thinker Fichte recoiled.  You will\r\nfind the record of this struggle between head and heart in his book,\r\nentitled 'Die Bestimmung des Menschen'--The Vocation of Man.\r\n[Footnote: Translated by Dr. William Smith of Edinburgh; Truebner,\r\n1873.]  Fichte was determined at all hazards to maintain his freedom,\r\nbut the price he paid for it indicates the difficulty of the task.  To\r\nescape from the iron necessity seen everywhere reigning in physical\r\nnature, he turned defiantly round upon nature and law, and affirmed\r\nboth of them to be the products of his own mind.  He was not going to\r\nbe the slave of a thing which he had himself created.  There is a good\r\ndeal to be said in favour of this view, but few of us probably would\r\nbe able to bring into play the solvent transcendentalism whereby\r\nFichte melted his chains.\r\n\r\nWhy do some regard this notion of necessity with terror, while others\r\ndo not fear it at all?  Has not Carlyle somewhere said that a belief\r\nin destiny is the bias of all earnest minds?  'It is not Nature,' says\r\nFichte, 'it is Freedom itself, by which the greatest and most\r\nterrible disorders incident to our race are produced.  Man is the\r\ncruellest enemy of man.' But the question of moral responsibility here\r\nemerges, and it is the possible loosening of this responsibility that\r\nso many of us dread.  The notion of necessity certainly failed to\r\nfrighten Bishop Butler.  He thought it untrue even absurd--but he did\r\nnot fear its practical consequences.  He showed, on the contrary, in\r\nthe 'Analogy,' that as far as human conduct is concerned, the two\r\ntheories of free-will and necessity would come to the same in the end.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by free-will?  Does it imply the power of producing\r\nevents without antecedents?--of starting, as it were, upon a creative\r\ntour of occurrences without any impulse from within or from without?\r\nLet us consider the point.  If there be absolutely or relatively no\r\nreason why a tree should fall, it will not fall; and if there be\r\nabsolutely or relatively no reason why a man should act, he will not\r\nact.  It is true that the united voice of this assembly could not\r\npersuade me that I have not, at this moment, the power to lift my arm\r\nif I wished to do so.  Within this range the conscious freedom of my\r\nwill cannot be questioned.  But what about the origin of the 'wish'?\r\nAre we, or are we not, complete masters of the circumstances which\r\ncreate our wishes, motives, and tendencies to action?  Adequate\r\nreflection will, I think, prove that we are not.  What, for example,\r\nhave I had to do with the generation and development of that which\r\nsome will consider my total being, and others a most potent factor of\r\nmy total being--the living, speaking organism which now addresses you?\r\nAs stated at the beginning of this discourse, my physical and\r\nintellectual textures were woven for me, not by me.  Processes in the\r\nconduct or regulation of which I had no share have made me what I am.\r\nHere, surely, if anywhere, we are as clay in the hands of the potter.\r\nIt is the greatest of delusions to suppose that we come into this\r\nworld as sheets of white paper on which the age can write anything it\r\nlikes, making us good or bad, noble or mean, as the age pleases.  The\r\nage can stunt, promote, or pervert pre-existent capacities, but it\r\ncannot create them.  The worthy Robert Owen, who saw in external\r\ncircumstances the great moulders of human character, was obliged to\r\nsupplement his doctrine by making the man himself one of the\r\ncircumstances.  It is as fatal as it is cowardly to blink facts\r\nbecause they are not to our taste.  How many disorders, ghostly and\r\nbodily, are transmitted to us by inheritance?  In our courts of law,\r\nwhenever it is a question whether a crime has been committed under the\r\ninfluence of insanity, the best guidance the judge and jury can have\r\nis derived from the parental antecedents of the accused.  If among\r\nthese insanity be exhibited in any marked degree, the presumption in\r\nthe prisoner's favour is enormously enhanced, because the experience\r\nof life has taught both judge and jury that insanity is frequently\r\ntransmitted from parent to child.\r\n\r\nI met, some years ago, in a railway carriage the governor of one of\r\nour largest prisons.  He was evidently an observant and reflective\r\nman, possessed of wide experience gathered in various parts of the\r\nworld, and a thorough student of the duties of his vocation.  He told\r\nme that the prisoners in his charge might be divided into three\r\ndistinct classes.  The first class consisted of persons who ought\r\nnever to have been in prison.  External accident, and not internal\r\ntaint, had brought them within the grasp of the law, and what had\r\nhappened to them might happen to most of us.  They were essentially\r\nmen of sound moral stamina, though wearing the prison garb.  Then came\r\nthe largest class, formed of individuals possessing no strong bias,\r\nmoral or immoral, plastic to the touch of circumstances, which could\r\nmould them into either good or evil members of society.  Thirdly came\r\na class--happily not a large one--whom no kindness could conciliate\r\nand no discipline tame.  They were sent into this world labelled\r\n'incorrigible', wickedness being stamped, as it were, upon their\r\norganisations.  It was an unpleasant truth, but as a truth it ought to\r\nbe faced.  For such criminals the prison over which he ruled was\r\ncertainly not the proper place.  If confined at all, their prison\r\nshould be on a desert island where the deadly _contagium_ of their\r\nexample could not taint the moral air.  But the sea itself he was\r\ndisposed to regard as a cheap and appropriate substitute for the\r\nisland.  It seemed to him evident that the State would benefit if\r\nprisoners of the first class were liberated; prisoners of the second\r\nclass educated; and prisoners of the third class put compendiously\r\nunder water.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, from the observation of individuals that the\r\nargument against 'free-will,' as commonly understood, derives its\r\nprincipal force.  It is, as already hinted, indefinitely strengthened\r\nwhen extended to the race.  Most of you have been forced to listen to\r\nthe outcries and denunciations which rang discordant through the land\r\nfor some years after the publication of Mr. Darwin's 'Origin of\r\nSpecies.'  Well, the world--even the clerical world--for the most part\r\nsettled down in the belief that Mr. Darwin's book simply reflects the\r\ntruth of nature: that we who are now 'foremost in the files of time'\r\nhave come to the front through almost endless stages of promotion from\r\nlower to higher forms of life.\r\n\r\nIf to any one of us were given the privilege of looking back through\r\nthe aeons across which life has crept towards its present outcome, his\r\nvision, according to Darwin, would ultimately reach a point when the\r\nprogenitors of this assembly could not be called human.  From that\r\nhumble society, through the interaction of its members and the storing\r\nup of their best qualities, a better one emerged; from this again a\r\nbetter still; until at length, by the integration of infinitesimals\r\nthrough ages of amelioration, we came to be what we are to-day.  We of\r\nthis generation had no conscious share in the production of this grand\r\nand beneficent result.  Any and every generation which preceded us had\r\njust as little share.  The favoured organisms whose garnered\r\nexcellence constitutes our present store owed their advantages, first,\r\nto what we in our ignorance are obliged to call accidental variation;'\r\nand, secondly, to a law of heredity in the passing of which our\r\nsuffrages were not collected.  With characteristic felicity and\r\nprecision Mr. Matthew Arnold lifts this question into the free air of\r\npoetry, but not out of the atmosphere of truth, when he ascribes the\r\nprocess of amelioration to 'a power not ourselves which makes for\r\nrighteousness.'  If, then, our organisms, with all their tendencies\r\nand capacities, are given to us without our being consulted; and if,\r\nwhile capable of acting within certain limits in accordance with our\r\nwishes, we are not masters of the circumstances in which motives and\r\nwishes originate; if, finally, our motives and wishes determine our\r\nactions--in what sense can these actions be said to be the result of\r\nfree-will?\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHere, again, we are confronted with the question of moral\r\nresponsibility, which, as it has been much talked of lately, it is\r\ndesirable to meet.  With the view of removing the fear of our falling\r\nback into the condition of 'the ape and tiger,' so sedulously excited\r\nby certain writers, I propose to grapple with this question in its\r\nrudest form, and in the most uncompromising way.  'If,' says the\r\nrobber, the ravisher, or the murderer, 'I act because I must act, what\r\nright have you to hold me responsible for my deeds?' The reply is,\r\n'The right of society to protect itself against aggressive and\r\ninjurious forces, whether they be bond or free, forces of nature or\r\nforces of man.'  'Then,' retorts the criminal, 'you punish me for\r\nwhat I cannot help.'  'Let it be granted,' says society, 'but had you\r\nknown that the treadmill or the gallows was certainly in store for\r\nyou, you might have \"helped.\"  Let us reason the matter fully and\r\nfrankly out.  We may entertain no malice or hatred against you; it is\r\nenough that with a view to our own safety and purification we are\r\ndetermined that you and such as you shall not enjoy liberty of evil\r\naction in our midst. You, who have behaved as a wild beast, we claim\r\nthe right to cage or kill as we should a wild beast. The public safety\r\nis a matter of more importance than the very limited chance of your\r\nmoral renovation, while the knowledge that you have been hanged by the\r\nneck may furnish to others about to do as you have done the precise\r\nmotive which will hold them back.  If your act be such as to invoke a\r\nminor penalty, then not only others, but yourself, may profit by the\r\npunishment which we inflict.  On the homely principle that \"a burnt\r\nchild dreads the fire,\" it will make you think twice before venturing\r\non a repetition of your crime.  Observe, finally, the consistency of\r\nour conduct.  You offend, you say, because you cannot help offending,\r\nto the public detriment.  We punish, is our reply, because we cannot\r\nhelp punishing, for the public good.  Practically, then, as Bishop\r\nButler predicted, we act as the world acted when it supposed the evil\r\ndeeds of its criminals to be the products of free-will.' [Footnote:\r\nAn eminent Church dignitary describes all this, not unkindly, as\r\n'truculent logic.' I think it worthy of his Grace's graver\r\nconsideration.]\r\n\r\n'What,' I have heard it argued, 'is the use of preaching about duty,\r\nif a man's predetermined position in the moral world renders him\r\nincapable of profiting by advice?'  Who knows that he is incapable?\r\nThe preacher's last word is a factor in the man's conduct, and it may\r\nbe a most important factor, unlocking moral energies which might\r\notherwise remain imprisoned and unused.  If the preacher thoroughly\r\nfeel that words of enlightenment, courage, and admonition enter into\r\nthe list of forces employed by Nature herself for man's amelioration,\r\nsince she gifted man with speech, he will suffer no paralysis to fall\r\nupon his tongue.  Dung the fig-tree hopefully, and not until its\r\nbarrenness has been demonstrated beyond a doubt let the sentence go\r\nforth, 'Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?'\r\n\r\nI remember when a youth in the town of Halifax, some two-and-thirty\r\nyears ago, attending a lecture given by a young man to a small but\r\nselect audience.  The aspect of the lecturer was earnest and\r\npractical, and his voice soon rivetted attention.  He spoke of duty,\r\ndefining it as a debt owed, and there was a kindling vigour in his\r\nwords which must have strengthened the sense of duty in the minds of\r\nthose who heard him.  No speculations regarding the freedom of the\r\nwill could alter the fact that the words of that young man did me\r\ngood.  His name was George Dawson.  He also spoke, if you will allow\r\nme to allude to it, of a social subject much discussed at the\r\ntime--the Chartist subject of 'levelling.' Suppose, he says, two men\r\nto be equal at night, and that one rises at six, while the other\r\nsleeps till nine next morning, what becomes of your levelling?  And in\r\nso speaking be made himself the mouthpiece of Nature, which, as we\r\nhave seen, secures advance, not by the reduction of all to a common\r\nlevel, but by the encouragement and conservation of what is best.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that, in dealing as above with my hypothetical\r\ncriminal, I am assuming a state of things brought about by the\r\ninfluence of religions which include the dogmas of theology and the\r\nbelief in freewill--a state, namely, in which a moral majority control\r\nand keep in awe an immoral minority.  The heart of man is deceitful\r\nabove all things, and desperately wicked.  Withdraw, then, our\r\ntheologic sanctions, including the belief in free-will, and the\r\ncondition of the race will be typified by the samples of individual\r\nwickedness which have been above adduced.  We shall all, that is,\r\nbecome robbers, and ravishers, and murderers.  From much that has been\r\nwritten of late it would seem that this astounding inference finds\r\nhouse-room in many minds.  Possibly, the people who hold such views\r\nmight be able to illustrate them by individual instances.\r\n\r\n    The fear of hell's a hangman's whip,\r\n    To keep the wretch in order.\r\n\r\nRemove the fear, and the wretch, following his natural instinct, may\r\nbecome disorderly; but I refuse to accept him as a sample of humanity.\r\n'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die' is by no means the\r\nethical consequence of a rejection of dogma.  To many of you the name\r\nof George Jacob Holyoake is doubtless familiar, and you are probably\r\naware that at no man in England has the term 'atheist' been more\r\nfrequently pelted.  There are, moreover, really few who have more\r\ncompletely liberated themselves from theologic notions.  Among\r\nworking-class politicians Mr. Holyoake is a leader.  Does he exhort\r\nhis followers to 'Eat and drink, for to-morrow we die'?  Not so.  In\r\nthe August number of the 'Nineteenth Century' you will find these\r\nwords from his pen: 'The gospel of dirt is bad enough, but the gospel\r\nof mere material comfort is much worse.' He contemptuously calls the\r\nComtist championship of the working man, 'the championship of the\r\ntrencher.' He would place 'the leanest liberty which brought with it\r\nthe dignity and power of self-help' higher than 'any prospect of a\r\nfull plate without it.' Such is the moral doctrine taught by this\r\n'atheistic' leader; and no Christian, I apprehend, need be ashamed of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMost heartily do I recognise and admire the spiritual radiance, if I\r\nmay use the term, shed by religion on the minds and lives of many\r\npersonally known to me.  At the same time I cannot but observe how\r\nsignally, as regards the production of anything beautiful, religion\r\nfails in other cases.  Its professor and defender is sometimes at\r\nbottom a brawler and a clown.  These differences depend upon primary\r\ndistinctions of character which religion does not remove.  It may\r\ncomfort some to know that there are amongst us many whom the\r\ngladiators of the pulpit would call 'atheists' and 'materialists,'\r\nwhose lives, nevertheless, as tested by any accessible standard of\r\nmorality, would contrast more than favourably with the lives of those\r\nwho seek to stamp them with this offensive brand.  When I say\r\n'offensive,' I refer simply to the intention of those who use such\r\nterms, and not because atheism or materialism, when compared with many\r\nof the notions ventilated in the columns of religious newspapers, has\r\nany particular offensiveness for me.  If I wished to find men who are\r\nscrupulous in their adherence to engagements, whose words are their\r\nbond, and to whom moral shiftiness of any kind is subjectively\r\nunknown; if I wanted a loving father, a faithful husband, an\r\nhonourable neighbour, and a just citizen--I should seek him, and find\r\nhim among the band of 'atheists' to which I refer.  I have known some\r\nof the most pronounced among them not only in life but in death seen\r\nthem approaching with open eyes the inexorable goal, with no dread of\r\na 'hangman's whip,' with no hope of a heavenly crown, and still as\r\nmindful of their duties, and as faithful in the discharge of them, as\r\nif their eternal future depended upon their latest deeds.\r\n\r\nIn letters addressed to myself, and in utterances addressed to the\r\npublic, Faraday is often referred to as a sample of the association of\r\nreligious faith with moral elevation.  I was locally intimate with him\r\nfor fourteen or fifteen years of my life, and had thus occasion to\r\nobserve how nearly his character approached what might, without\r\nextravagance, be called perfection.  He was strong but gentle,\r\nimpetuous but self-restrained; a sweet and lofty courtesy marked his\r\ndealings with men and women; and though he sprang from the body of the\r\npeople, a nature so fine might well have been distilled from the\r\nflower of antecedent chivalry.  Not only in its broader sense was the\r\nChristian religion necessary to Faraday's spiritual peace, but in what\r\nmany would call the narrow sense held by those described by Faraday\r\nhimself as 'a very small and despised sect of Christians, known, if\r\nknown at all, as Sandemanians,' it constituted the light and comfort\r\nof his days.\r\n\r\nWere our experience confined to such cases, it would furnish an\r\nirresistible argument in favour of the association of dogmatic\r\nreligion with moral purity and grace.  But, as already intimated, our\r\nexperience is not thus confined.  In further illustration of this\r\npoint, we may compare with Faraday a philosopher of equal magnitude,\r\nwhose character, including gentleness and strength, candour and\r\nsimplicity, intellectual power and moral elevation, singularly\r\nresembles that of the great Sandemanian, but who has neither shared\r\nthe theologic views nor the religious emotions which formed so\r\ndominant a factor in Faraday's life.  I allude to Mr. Charles Darwin,\r\nthe Abraham of scientific men--a searcher as obedient to the command\r\nof truth as was the patriarch to the command of God.  I cannot\r\ntherefore, as so many desire, look upon Faraday's religious belief as\r\nthe exclusive source of qualities shared so conspicuously by one\r\nuninfluenced by that belief.  To a deeper virtue belonging to human\r\nnature in its purer forms I am disposed to refer the excellence of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nSuperstition may be defined as constructive religion which has grown\r\nincongruous with intelligence.  We may admit, with Fichte, 'that\r\nsuperstition has unquestionably constrained its subjects to abandon\r\nmany pernicious practices and to adopt many useful ones;' the real\r\nloss accompanying its decay at the present day has been thus clearly\r\nstated by the same philosopher: 'In so far as these lamentations do\r\nnot proceed from the priests themselves--whose grief at the loss of\r\ntheir dominion over the human mind we can well understand--but from\r\nthe politicians, the whole matter resolves itself into this, that\r\ngovernment has thereby become more difficult and expensive.  The judge\r\nwas spared the exercise of his own sagacity and penetration when, by\r\nthreats of relentless damnation, he could compel the accused to make\r\nconfession.  The evil spirit formerly performed without reward\r\nservices for which in later times judges and policemen have to be\r\npaid.'\r\n\r\nNo man ever felt the need of a high and ennobling religion more\r\nthoroughly than this powerful and fervid teacher, who, by the way, did\r\nnot escape the brand of 'atheist.' But Fichte asserted emphatically\r\nthe power and sufficiency of morality in its own sphere.  'Let us\r\nconsider,' he says, 'the highest which man can possess in the absence\r\nof religion--I mean pure morality.  The moral man obeys the law of\r\nduty in his breast absolutely, because it is a law unto him; and he\r\ndoes whatever reveals itself to him as his duty simply because it is\r\nduty.  Let not the impudent assertion be repeated that such an\r\nobedience, without regard for consequences, and without desire for\r\nconsequences, is in itself impossible and opposed to human nature.'\r\nSo much for Fichte.  Faraday was equally distinct.  'I have no\r\nintention,' he says, 'of substituting anything for religion, but I\r\nwish to take that part of human nature which is independent of it.\r\nMorality, philosophy, commerce, the various institutions and habits of\r\nsociety, are independent of religion and may exist without it.'  These\r\nwere the words of his youth, but they expressed his latest\r\nconvictions.  I would add, that the muse of Tennyson never reached a\r\nhigher strain than when it embodied the sentiment of duty in AEnone:\r\n\r\n    And, because right is right, to follow right\r\n    Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.\r\n\r\nNot in the way assumed by our dogmatic teachers has the morality of\r\nhuman nature been built up.  The power which has moulded us thus far\r\nhas worked with stern tools upon a very rigid stuff.  What it has done\r\ncannot be so readily undone; and it has endowed us with moral\r\nconstitutions which take pleasure in the noble, the beautiful, and the\r\ntrue, just as surely as it has endowed us with sentient organisms,\r\nwhich find aloes bitter and sugar sweet.  That power did not work with\r\ndelusions, nor will it stay its hand when such are removed.  Facts,\r\nrather than dogmas, have been its ministers--hunger and thirst, heat\r\nand cold, pleasure and pain, fervour, sympathy, aspiration, shame,\r\npride, love, hate, terror, awe--such were the forces whose interaction\r\nand adjustment throughout an immeasurable past wove the triplex web of\r\nman's physical, intellectual, and moral nature, and such are the\r\nforces that will be effectual to the end.\r\n\r\nYou may retort that even on my own showing 'the power which makes for\r\nrighteousness' has dealt in delusions; for it cannot be denied that\r\nthe beliefs of religion, including the dogmas of theology and the\r\nfreedom of the will, have had some effect in moulding the moral world.\r\nGranted; but I do not think that this goes to the root of the matter.\r\nAre you quite sure that those beliefs and dogmas are primary, and not\r\nderived?--that they are not the products, instead of being the\r\ncreators, of man's moral nature?  I think it is in one of the\r\nLatter-Day Pamphlets that Carlyle corrects a reasoner, who deduced the\r\nnobility of man from a belief in heaven, by telling him that he puts\r\nthe cart before the horse, the real truth being that the belief in\r\nheaven is derived from the nobility of man.  The bird's instinct to\r\nweave its nest is referred to by Emerson as typical of the force which\r\nbuilt cathedrals, temples, and pyramids:\r\n\r\n    Knowest thou what wove yon woodbird's nest\r\n    Of leaves and feathers from her breast,\r\n    Or how the fish outbuilt its shell,\r\n    Painting with morn each annual cell?\r\n    Such and so grew these holy piles\r\n    While love and terror laid the tiles;\r\n    Earth proudly wears the Parthenon\r\n    As the best gem upon her zone;\r\n    And Morning opes with haste her lids\r\n    To gaze upon the Pyramids;\r\n    O'er England's abbeys bends the sky\r\n    As on its friends with kindred eye;\r\n    For out of Thought's interior sphere\r\n    These wonders rose to upper air,\r\n    And nature gladly gave them place,\r\n    Adopted them into her race,\r\n    And granted them an equal date\r\n    With Andes and with Ararat.\r\n\r\nSurely, many utterances which have been accepted as descriptions ought\r\nto be interpreted as aspirations, or, as having their roots in\r\naspiration instead of in objective knowledge.  Does the song of the\r\nherald angels, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,\r\ngoodwill toward men,' express the exaltation and the yearning of a\r\nhuman soul?  or does it describe an optical and acoustical fact--a\r\nvisible host and an audible song?  If the former, the exaltation and\r\nthe yearning are man's imperishable possession--a ferment long\r\nconfined to individuals, but which may by-and-by become the leaven of\r\nthe race.  If the latter, then belief in the entire transaction is\r\nwrecked by non-fulfilment.  Look to the East at the present moment as\r\na comment on the promise of peace' on earth and goodwill toward men.\r\nThat promise is a dream ruined by the experience of eighteen\r\ncenturies, and in that ruin is involved the claim of the 'heavenly\r\nhost' to prophetic vision.  But though the mechanical theory proves\r\nuntenable, the immortal song and the feelings it expresses are still\r\nours, to be incorporated, let us hope, in purer and less shadowy forms\r\nin the poetry, philosophy, and practice of the future.\r\n\r\nThus, following the lead of physical science, we are brought without\r\nsolution of continuity into the presence of problems which, as usually\r\nclassified, lie entirely outside the domain of physics.  To these\r\nproblems thoughtful and penetrative minds are now applying those\r\nmethods of research which in physical science have proved their truth\r\nby their fruits.  There is on all hands a growing repugnance to invoke\r\nthe supernatural in accounting for the phenomena of human life; and\r\nthe thoughtful minds just referred to, finding no trace of evidence in\r\nfavour of any other origin, are driven to seek in the interaction of\r\nsocial forces the genesis and development of man's moral nature.  If\r\nthey succeed in their search--and I think they are sure to\r\nsucceed--social duty will be raised to a higher level of significance\r\nand the deepening sense of social duty will, it is to be hoped,\r\nlessen, if not obliterate, the strifes and heartburnings which now\r\nbeset and disfigure our social life.  Towards this great end it\r\nbehoves us one and all to work; and devoutly wishing its consummation,\r\nI have the honour, ladies and gentlemen, to bid you a friendly\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXV.  PROFESSOR VIRCHOW AND EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nTHIS world of ours has, on the whole, been an inclement region for the\r\ngrowth of natural truth; but it may be that the plant is all the\r\nhardier for the bendings and buffetings it has undergone.  The\r\ntorturing of a shrub, within certain limits, strengthens it. Through\r\nthe struggles and passions of the brute, man reaches his estate;\r\nthrough savagery and barbarism his civilisation; and through illusion\r\nand persecution his knowledge of nature, including that of his own\r\nframe.  The bias towards natural truth must have been strong to have\r\nwithstood and overcome the opposing forces.  Feeling appeared in the\r\nworld before Knowledge; and thoughts, conceptions, and creeds, founded\r\non emotion, had, before the dawn of science, taken root in man.  Such\r\nthoughts, conceptions, and creeds must have met a deep and general\r\nwant; otherwise their growth could not have been so luxuriant, nor\r\ntheir abiding power so strong.  This general need--this hunger for the\r\nideal and wonderful--led eventually to the differentiation of a caste,\r\nwhose vocation it was to cultivate the mystery of life and its\r\nsurroundings, and to give shape, name, and habitation to the emotions\r\nwhich that mystery aroused.  Even the savage lived, not by bread\r\nalone, but in a mental world peopled with forms answering to his\r\ncapacities and needs.  As time advanced--in other words, as the savage\r\nopened out into civilised man--these forms were purified and ennobled\r\nuntil they finally emerged in the mythology and art of Greece:\r\n\r\n    Where still the magic robe of Poesy\r\n    Wound itself lovingly around the Truth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote:\r\n\r\n    Da der Dichtung zauberische Huelle\r\n    Sich noch lieblich um die Wahrheit wand.'--Schiller.]\r\n\r\nAs poets, the priesthood would have been justified, their deities,\r\ncelestial and otherwise, with all their retinue and appliances, being\r\nmore or less legitimate symbols and personifications of the aspects of\r\nnature and the phases of the human soul.  The priests, however, or\r\nthose among them who were mechanics, and not poets, claimed objective\r\nvalidity for their conceptions, and tried to base upon external\r\nevidence that which sprang from the innermost need and nature of man.\r\nIt is against this objective rendering of the emotions--this thrusting\r\ninto the region of fact and positive knowledge of conceptions\r\nessentially ideal and poetic--that science, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, wages war.  Religious feeling is as much a verity as\r\nany other part of human consciousness; and against it, on its\r\nsubjective side, the waves of science beat in vain.  But when,\r\nmanipulated by the constructive imagination, mixed with imperfect or\r\ninaccurate historic data, and moulded by misapplied logic, this\r\nfeeling makes claims which traverse our knowledge of nature, science,\r\nas in duty bound, stands as a hostile power in its path.  It is\r\nagainst the mythologic scenery, if I may use the term, rather than\r\nagainst the life and substance of religion, that Science enters her\r\nprotest. Sooner or later among thinking people, that scenery will be\r\ntaken for what it is worth--as an effort on the part of man to bring\r\nthe mystery of life and nature within the range of his capacities; as\r\na temporary and essentially fluxional rendering in terms of knowledge\r\nof that which transcends all knowledge, and admits only of ideal\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nThe signs of the times, I think, point in this direction.  It is, for\r\nexample, the obvious aim of Mr. Matthew Arnold to protect, amid the\r\nwreck of dogma, the poetic basis of religion.  And it is to be\r\nremembered that under the circumstances poetry may be the purest\r\naccessible truth.  In other influential quarters a similar spirit is\r\nat work.  In a remarkable article published by Professor Knight of St.\r\nAndrews in the September number of the 'Nineteenth Century,' amid\r\nother free utterances, we have this one: 'If matter is not eternal,\r\nits first emergence into being is a miracle beside which all others\r\ndwindle into absolute insignificance.  But, as has often been pointed\r\nout, the process is unthinkable; the sudden apocalypse of a material\r\nworld out of blank nonentity cannot be imagined; [Footnote: Professor\r\nKnight will have to reckon with the English Marriage Service, one of\r\nwhose Collects begins thus: 'O God, who by thy mighty power halt made\r\nall things of nothing.] its emergence into order out of chaos when\r\n\"without form and void\" of life, is merely a poetic rendering of the\r\ndoctrine of its slow evolution.' These are all bold words to be spoken\r\nbefore the moral philosophy class of a Scotch university, while those\r\nI have underlined show a remarkable freedom of dealing with the sacred\r\ntext.  They repeat in terser language what I ventured to utter four\r\nyears ago regarding the Book of Genesis. 'Profoundly interesting and\r\nindeed pathetic to me are those attempts of the opening mind of man to\r\nappease its hunger for a Cause.  But the Book of Genesis has no voice\r\nin scientific questions. _It is a poem, not a scientific treatise._  In\r\nthe former aspect it is for ever beautiful; in the latter it has been,\r\nand it will continue to be, purely obstructive and hurtful.' My\r\nagreement with Professor Knight extends still further.  'Does the\r\nvital,' he asks, 'proceed by a still remoter development from the\r\nnon-vital?  Or was it created by a fiat of volition?  Or'--and here he\r\nemphasises his question--'has it always existed in some form or other\r\nas an eternal constituent of the universe?  I do not see,' he replies,\r\n'how we can escape from the last alternative.' With the whole force of\r\nmy conviction I say, Nor do I, though our modes of regarding the\r\n'eternal constituent' may not be the same.\r\n\r\nWhen matter was defined by Descartes, he deliberately excluded the\r\nidea of force or motion from its attributes and from his definition.\r\nExtension only was taken into account.  And, inasmuch as the impotence\r\nof matter to generate motion was assumed, its observed motions were\r\nreferred to an external cause.  God, resident outside of matter, gave\r\nthe impulse.  In this connection the argument in Young's 'Night\r\nThoughts' will occur to most readers:\r\n\r\n    Who Motion foreign to the smallest grain\r\n    Shot through vast masses of enormous weight?\r\n    Who bid brute Matter's restive lump assume\r\n    Such various forms, and gave it wings to fly?\r\n\r\nAgainst this notion of Descartes the great deist John Toland, whose\r\nashes lie unmarked in Putney Churchyard, strenuously contended.  He\r\naffirmed motion to be an inherent attribute of matter--that no portion\r\nof matter was at rest, and that even the most quiescent solids were\r\nanimated by a motion of their ultimate particles.  The success of his\r\ncontention, according to the learned and laborious Dr. Berthold,\r\n[Footnote: 'John Toland und der Monismus der Gegenwart,' Heidelberg,\r\nCarl Winter.] entitles Toland to be regarded as the founder of that\r\nmonistic doctrine which is now so rapidly spreading.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the idea of vitality entertained in our day by\r\nProfessor Knight, closely resembles the idea of motion entertained by\r\nhis opponents in Toland's day.  Motion was then virtually asserted to\r\nbe a thing sui generis, distinct from matter, and incapable of being\r\ngenerated out of matter.  Hence the obvious inference when matter was\r\nobserved to move.  It was the vehicle of an energy not its own--the\r\nrepository of forces impressed on it from without--the purely passive\r\nrecipient of the shock of the Divine.  The logical form continues, but\r\nthe subject-matter is changed.  'The evolution of nature,' says\r\nProfessor Knight, 'may be a fact; a daily and hourly apocalypse.  But\r\nwe have no evidence of the non-vital passing into the vital.\r\nSpontaneous generation is, as yet, an imaginative guess, unverified by\r\nscientific tests.  And matter is not itself alive.  Vitality, whether\r\nseen in a single cell of protoplasm or in the human brain, is a thing\r\nsui generis, distinct from matter, and incapable of being generated\r\nout of matter.' It may be, however, that, in process of time, vitality\r\nwill follow the example of motion, and, after the necessary antecedent\r\nwrangling, take its place among the attributes of that 'universal\r\nmother' who has been so often misdefined.\r\n\r\nThat 'matter is not itself alive' Professor Knight seems to regard as\r\nan axiomatic truth.  Let us place in contrast with this the notion\r\nentertained by the philosopher Ueberweg, one of the subtlest heads\r\nthat Germany has produced.  'What occurs in the brain' says Ueberweg\r\n'would, in my opinion, not be possible, if the process which here\r\nappears in its greatest concentration did not obtain generally, only\r\nin a vastly diminished degree.  Take a pair of mice and a cask of\r\nflour.  By copious nourishment the animals increase and multiply, and\r\nin the same proportion sensations and feelings augment.  The quantity\r\nof these latter possessed by the first pair, is not simply diffused\r\namong their descendants, for in that case the last must feel more\r\nfeebly than the first. The sensations and feelings must necessarily be\r\nreferred back to the flour, where they exist, weak and pale it is\r\ntrue, and not concentrated as they are in the brain.' [Footnote:\r\nLetter to Lange: 'Geschichte des Materialismus,' zweite Aufl,\r\nvol. ii. p. 521.]  We may not be able to taste or smell alcohol in a\r\ntub of fermented cherries, but by distillation we obtain from them\r\nconcentrated Kirschwasser.  Hence Ueberweg's comparison of the brain\r\nto a still, which concentrates the sensation and feeling,\r\npre-existing, but diluted in the food.\r\n\r\n'Definitions,' says Mr. Holyoake, [Footnote: 'Nineteenth Century,'\r\nSeptember 1878.] 'grow as the horizon of experience expands.  They\r\nare not inventions, but descriptions of the state of a question.  No\r\nman sees all through a discovery at once.' Thus Descartes's notion of\r\nmatter, and his explanation of motion, would be put aside as trivial\r\nby a physiologist or a crystallographer of the present day.  They are\r\nnot descriptions of the state of the question.  And yet a desire\r\nsometimes shows itself in distinguished quarters to bind us own to\r\nconceptions which passed muster in the infancy of knowledge, but which\r\nare wholly incompatible with our present enlightenment.  Mr.\r\nMartineau, I think, errs when he seeks to hold me to views enunciated\r\nby 'Democritus and the mathematicians.' That definitions should change\r\nas knowledge advances is in accordance both with sound sense and\r\nscientific practice.  When, for example, the undulatory theory was\r\nstarted, it was not imagined that the vibrations of light could be\r\ntransverse to the direction of propagation.  The example of sound was\r\nat hand, which was a case of longitudinal vibration.  Now the\r\nsubstitution of transverse for longitudinal vibrations in the case of\r\nlight involved a radical change of conception as to the mechanical\r\nproperties of the luminiferous medium.  But though this change went so\r\nfar as to fill space with a substance, possessing the properties of a\r\nsolid, rather than those of a gas, the change was accepted, because\r\nthe newly discovered facts imperatively demanded it.  Following Mr.\r\nMartineau's example, the opponent of the undulatory theory might\r\neffectually twit the holder of it on his change of front.  'This\r\naether of yours,' he might say, 'alters its style with every change\r\nof service.  Starting as a beggar, with scarce a rag of 'property' to\r\ncover its bones, it turns up as a prince when large undertakings are\r\nwanted.  You had some show of reason when, with the case of sound\r\nbefore you, you assumed your aether to be a gas in the last extremity\r\nof attenuation.  But now that new service is rendered necessary by new\r\nfacts, you drop the beggar's rags, and accomplish an undertaking,\r\ngreat and princely enough in all conscience; for it implies that not\r\nonly planets of enormous weight, but comets with hardly any weight at\r\nall, fly through your hypothetical solid without perceptible loss of\r\nmotion.' This would sound very cogent, but it would be very vain.\r\nEqually vain, in my opinion, is Mr. Martineau's contention that we are\r\nnot justified in modifying, in accordance with advancing knowledge,\r\nour notions of matter.\r\n\r\nBefore parting from Professor Knight, let me commend his courage as\r\nwell as his insight.  We have heard much of late of the peril to\r\nmorality involved in the decay of religious belief.  What Mr. Knight\r\nsays under this head is worthy of all respect and attention.  'I\r\nadmit,' he writes, 'that were it proved that the moral faculty was\r\nderived as well as developed, its present decisions would not be\r\ninvalidated.  The child of experience has a father whose teachings are\r\ngrave, peremptory, and august; and an earthborn rule may be as\r\nstringent as any derived from a celestial source.  It does not even\r\nfollow that a belief in the material origin of spiritual existence,\r\naccompanied by a corresponding decay of belief in immortality, must\r\nnecessarily lead to a relaxation of the moral fibre of the race.\r\n[Footnote: Is this really certain?  Instead of standing in the\r\nrelation of cause and effect, may not the 'decay' and 'relaxation' be\r\nmerely coexistent, both, perhaps, flowing from common historic\r\nantecedents?]  It is certain that it has often done so.  But it is\r\nequally certain that there have been individuals, and great historical\r\ncommunities, in which the absence of the latter belief has neither\r\nweakened moral earnestness, nor prevented devotional fervour.' I have\r\nelsewhere stated that some of the best men of my acquaintance--men\r\nlofty in thought and beneficent in act--belong to a class who\r\nassiduously let the belief referred to alone.  They derive from it\r\nneither stimulus nor inspiration, while--I say it with regret--were I\r\nin quest of persons who, in regard to the finer endowments of human\r\ncharacter, are to be ranked with the unendowed, I should find some\r\ncharacteristic samples among the noisier defenders of the orthodox\r\nbelief.  These, however, are but 'hand-specimens' on both sides; the\r\nwider data referred to by Professor Knight constitute, therefore, a\r\nwelcome corroboration of my experience.  Again, my excellent critic,\r\nProfessor Blackie, describes Buddha as being 'a great deal more than a\r\nprophet; a rare, exceptional, and altogether transcendental\r\nincarnation of moral perfection.' [Footnote: 'Natural History of\r\nAtheism,' p. 136.]  And yet, 'what Buddha preached was a gospel of\r\npure human ethics, divorced not only from Brahma and the Brahminic\r\nTrinity, but even from the existence of God.' [Footnote: Natural\r\nHistory of Atheism,' p. 125.]  These civilised and gallant voices\r\nfrom the North contrast pleasantly with the barbarous whoops which\r\nsometimes come to us along the same meridian.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLooking backwards from my present standpoint over the earnest past, a\r\nboyhood fond of play and physical action, but averse to schoolwork,\r\nlies before me.  The aversion did not arise from intellectual apathy\r\nor want of appetite for knowledge, but simply from the fact that my\r\nearliest teachers lacked the power of imparting vitality to what they\r\ntaught.  Athwart all play and amusement, however, a thread of\r\nseriousness ran through my character; and many a sleepless night of my\r\nchildhood has been passed, fretted by the question 'Who made God?'  I\r\nwas well versed in Scripture; for I loved the Bible, and was prompted\r\nby that love to commit large portions of it to memory.  Later on I\r\nbecame adroit in turning my Scriptural knowledge against the Church of\r\nRome, but the characteristic doctrines of that Church marked only for\r\na time the limits of enquiry.  The eternal Sonship of Christ, for\r\nexample, as enunciated in the Athanasian Creed, perplexed me.  The\r\nresurrection of the body was also a thorn in my mind, and here I\r\nremember that a passage in Blair's 'Grave' gave me momentary rest.\r\n\r\n                    Sure the same power\r\n    That rear'd the piece at first and took it down\r\n    Can reassemble the loose, scatter'd parts\r\n    And put them as they were.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion seemed for the moment entirely fair, but with further\r\nthought, my difficulties came back to me.  I had seen cows and sheep\r\nbrowsing upon churchyard grass, which sprang from the decaying mould\r\nof dead men.  The flesh of these animals was undoubtedly a\r\nmodification of human flesh, and the persons who fed upon them were as\r\nundoubtedly, in part, a more remote modification of the same\r\nsubstance.  I figured the self-same molecules as belonging first to\r\none body and afterwards to a different one, and I asked myself how two\r\nbodies so related could possibly arrange their claims at the day of\r\nresurrection.  The scattered parts of each were to be reassembled and\r\nset as they were.  But if handed over to the one, how could they\r\npossibly enter into the composition of the other?  Omnipotence itself,\r\nI concluded, could not reconcile the contradiction.  Thus the plank\r\nwhich Blair's mechanical theory of the resurrection brought\r\nmomentarily into sight, disappeared, and I was again cast abroad on\r\nthe waste ocean of speculation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I could by no means get rid of the idea that the\r\naspects of nature and the consciousness of man implied the operation\r\nof a power altogether beyond my grasp--an energy the thought of which\r\nraised the temperature of the mind, though it refused to accept shape,\r\npersonal or otherwise, from the intellect.  Perhaps the able critics\r\nof the 'Saturday Review' are justified in speaking as they sometimes\r\ndo of Mr. Carlyle.  They owe him nothing, and have a right to announce\r\nthe fact in their own way.  I, however, owe him a great deal, and am\r\nalso in honour bound to acknowledge the debt.  Few, perhaps, who are\r\nprivileged to come into contact with that illustrious man have shown\r\nhim a sturdier front than I have, or in discussing modern science have\r\nmore frequently withstood him.  But I could see that his contention at\r\nbottom always was that the human soul has claims and yearnings which\r\nphysical science cannot satisfy.  England to come will assuredly thank\r\nhim for his affirmation of the ethical and ideal side of human nature.\r\nBe this as it may, at the period now reached in my story the feeling\r\nreferred to was indefinitely strengthened, my whole life being at the\r\nsame time rendered more earnest, resolute, and laborious by the\r\nwritings of Carlyle.  Others also ministered to this result.  Emerson\r\nkindled me, while Fichte powerfully stirred my moral pulse. [Footnote:\r\nThe reader will find in the Seventeenth Lecture of Fichte's course on\r\nthe 'Characteristics of the Present Age' a sample of the vital power\r\nof this philosopher.]  In this relation I cared little for political\r\ntheories or philosophic systems, but a great deal for the propagated\r\nlife and strength of pure and powerful minds.  In my later\r\nschool-days, under a clever teacher, some knowledge of mathematics and\r\nphysics had been picked up: my stock of both was, however, scanty, and\r\nI resolved to augment it.  But it was really with the view of learning\r\nwhether mathematics and physics could help me in other spheres, rather\r\nthan with the desire of acquiring distinction in either science, that\r\nI ventured, in 1848, to break the continuity of my life, and devote\r\nthe meagre funds then at my disposal to the study of science in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nBut science soon fascinated me on its own account.  To carry it duly\r\nand honestly out, moral qualities were incessantly invoked.  There was\r\nno room allowed for insincerity--no room even for carelessness.  The\r\nedifice of science had been raised by men who had unswervingly\r\nfollowed the truth as it is in nature; and in doing so had often\r\nsacrificed interests which are usually potent in this world.  Among\r\nthese rationalistic men of Germany I found conscientiousness in work\r\nas much insisted on as it could be among theologians.  And why, since\r\nthey had not the rewards or penalties of the theologian to offer to\r\ntheir disciples?  Because they assumed, and were justified in\r\nassuming, that those whom they addressed had that within them which\r\nwould respond to their appeal.  If Germany should ever change for\r\nsomething less noble the simple earnestness and fidelity to duty,\r\nwhich in those days characterised her teachers, and through them her\r\nsons generally, it will not be because of rationalism.  Such a\r\ndecadent Germany might coexist with the most rampant rationalism\r\nwithout their standing to each other in the relation of cause and\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nMy first really laborious investigation, conducted jointly with my\r\nfriend Professor Knoblauch, landed me in a region which harmonised\r\nwith my speculative tastes.  It was essentially an enquiry in\r\nmolecular physics, having reference to the curious, and then\r\nperplexing, phenomena exhibited by crystals when freely suspended in\r\nthe magnetic field.  I here lived amid the most complex operations of\r\nmagnetism in its twofold aspect of an attractive and a repellent\r\nforce.  Iron was attracted by a magnet, bismuth was repelled, and the\r\ncrystals operated on ranged themselves under these two heads.  Faraday\r\nand Pluecker had worked assiduously at the subject, and had invoked\r\nthe aid of new forces to account for the phenomena.  It was soon,\r\nhowever, found that the displacement in a crystal of an atom of the\r\niron class by an atom of the bismuth class, involving no change of\r\ncrystalline form, produced a complete reversal of the phenomena.  The\r\nlines through the crystal which were in the one case drawn towards the\r\npoles of the magnet, were driven, in the other case, from these poles.\r\nBy such instances and the reasoning which they suggested,\r\nmagne-crystallic action was proved to be due, not to the operation of\r\nnew forces, but to the modification of the old ones by molecular\r\narrangement.  Whether diamagnetism, like magnetism, was a polar force,\r\nwas in those days a subject of the most lively contention.  It was\r\nfinally proved to be so; and the most complicated cases of\r\nmagne-crystallic action were immediately shown to be simple mechanical\r\nconsequences of the principle of diamagnetic polarity. These early\r\nresearches, which occupied in all five years of my life, and\r\nthroughout which the molecular architecture of crystals was an\r\nincessant subject of mental contemplation, gave a tinge and bias to my\r\nsubsequent scientific thought, and their influence is easily traced in\r\nmy subsequent enquiries.  For example, during nine years of labour on\r\nthe subject of radiation, heat and light were handled throughout by\r\nme, not as ends, but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might\r\nperchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter.\r\n\r\nScientific progress depends mainly upon two factors which incessantly\r\ninteract--the strengthening of the mind by exercise, and the\r\nillumination of phenomena by knowledge.  There seems no limit to the\r\ninsight regarding physical processes which this interaction carries in\r\nits train.  Through such insight we are enabled to enter and explore\r\nthat subsensible world into which all natural phenomena strike their\r\nroots, and from which they derive nutrition.  By it we are enabled to\r\nplace before the mind's eye atoms and atomic motions which lie far\r\nbeyond the range of the senses, and to apply to them reasoning as\r\nstringent as that applied by the mechanician to the motions and\r\ncollisions of sensible masses.  But once committed to such\r\nconceptions, there is a risk of being irresistibly led beyond the\r\nbounds of inorganic nature.  Even in those early stages of scientific\r\ngrowth, I found myself more and more compelled to regard not only\r\ncrystals, but organic structures, the body of man inclusive, as cases\r\nof molecular architecture, infinitely more complex, it is true, than\r\nthose of inorganic nature, but reducible, in the long run, to the same\r\nmechanical laws.  In ancient journals I find recorded ponderings and\r\nspeculations relating to these subjects, and attempts made, by\r\nreference to magnetic and crystalline phenomena, to present some\r\nsatisfactory image to the mind of the way in which plants and animals\r\nare built up.  Perhaps I may be excused for noting a sample of these\r\nearly speculations, already possibly known to a few of my readers, but\r\nwhich here finds a more suitable place than that which it formerly\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nSitting, in the summer of 1855, with my friend Dr. Rebus under the\r\nshadow of a massive elm on the bank of a river in Normandy, the\r\ncurrent of our thoughts and conversation was substantially this: We\r\nregarded the tree above us.  In opposition to gravity its molecules\r\nhad ascended, diverged into branches, and budded into innumerable\r\nleaves.  What caused them to do so--a power external to themselves, or\r\nan inherent force?  Science rejects the outside builder; let us,\r\ntherefore, consider from the other point of view the experience of the\r\npresent year.  A low temperature had kept back for weeks the life of\r\nthe vegetable world.  But at length the sun gained power--or, rather,\r\nthe cloud-screen which our atmosphere had drawn between him and us was\r\nremoved--and life immediately kindled under his warmth.  But what is\r\nlife, and how can solar light and heat thus affect it?  Near our elm\r\nwas a silver birch, with its leaves rapidly quivering in the morning\r\nair.  We had here motion, but not the motion of life.  Each leaf moved\r\nas a mass under the influence of an outside force, while the motion of\r\nlife was inherent and molecular.  How are we to figure this molecular\r\nmotion--the forces which it implies, and the results which flow from\r\nthem?  Suppose the leaves to be shaken from the tree and enabled to\r\nattract and repel each other.  To fix the ideas, suppose the point of\r\neach leaf to repel all the other points and to attract the roots, and\r\nthe root of each leaf to repel all other roots, but to attract the\r\npoints.  The leaves would then resemble an assemblage of little\r\nmagnets abandoned freely to the interaction of their own forces.  In\r\nobedience to these they would arrange themselves, and finally assume\r\npositions of rest, forming a coherent mass.  Let us suppose the\r\nbreeze, which now causes them to quiver, to disturb the assumed\r\nequilibrium.  As often as disturbed there would be a constant effort\r\non the part of the leaves to re-establish it; and in making this\r\neffort the mass of leaves would pass through different shapes and\r\nforms.  If other leaves, moreover, were at hand endowed with similar\r\nforces, the attraction would extend to them--a growth of the mass of\r\nleaves being the consequence.\r\n\r\nWe have strong reason for assuming that the ultimate particles of\r\nmatter--the atoms and molecules of which it is made up--are endowed\r\nwith forces coarsely typified by those here ascribed to the leaves.\r\nThe phenomena of crystallisation load, of necessity, to this\r\nconception of molecular polarity.  Under the operation of such forces\r\nthe molecules of a seed, like our fallen leaves in the first instance,\r\ntake up positions from which they would never move if undisturbed by\r\nan external impulse.  But solar light and heat, which come to us as\r\nwaves through space, are the great agents of molecular disturbance. On\r\nthe inert molecules of seed and soil these waves impinge, disturbing\r\nthe atomic equilibrium, which there is an immediate effort to restore.\r\nThe effort, incessantly defeated--for the waves continue to pour\r\nin--is incessantly renewed; in the molecular struggle matter is\r\ngathered from the soil and from the atmosphere, and built, in\r\nobedience to the forces which guide the molecules, into the special\r\nform of the tree.  In a general way, therefore, the life of the tree\r\nmight be defined as an unceasing effort to restore a disturbed\r\nequilibrium.  In the building of crystals Nature makes her first\r\nstructural effort; we have here the earliest groping of the so-called\r\n'vital force,' and the manifestations of this force in plants and\r\nanimals, though, as already stated, indefinitely more complex, are to\r\nbe regarded of the same mechanical quality as those concerned in the\r\nbuilding of the crystal.\r\n\r\nConsider the cycle of operations by which the seed produces the plant,\r\nthe plant the flower, the flower again the seed, the causal line,\r\nreturning with the fidelity of a planetary orbit to its original point\r\nof departure.  Who or what planned this molecular rhythm?  We do not\r\nknow--science fails even to inform us whether it was ever 'planned' at\r\nall.  Yonder butterfly has a spot of orange on its wing; and if we\r\nlook at a drawing made a century ago, of one of the ancestors of that\r\nbutterfly, we probably find the selfsame spot upon the wing.  For a\r\ncentury the molecules have described their cycles.  Butterflies have\r\nbeen begotten, have been born, and have died; still we find the\r\nmolecular architecture unchanged.  Who or what determined this\r\npersistency of recurrence?  We do not know; but we stand within our\r\nintellectual range when we say that there is probably nothing in that\r\nwing which may not yet find its Newton to prove that the principles\r\ninvolved in its construction are qualitatively the same as those\r\nbrought into play in the formation of the solar system.  We may even\r\ntake a step further, and affirm that the brain of man--the organ of\r\nhis reason--without which he can neither think nor feel, is also an\r\nassemblage of molecules, acting and reacting according to law.  Here,\r\nhowever, the methods pursued in mechanical science come to an end; and\r\nif asked to deduce from the physical interaction of the brain\r\nmolecules the least of the phenomena of sensation or thought, I\r\nacknowledge my helplessness.  The association of both with the matter\r\nof the brain may be as certain as the association of light with the\r\nrising of the sun.  But whereas in the latter case we have unbroken\r\nmechanical connection between the sun and our organs, in the former\r\ncase logical continuity disappears.  Between molecular mechanics and\r\nconsciousness is interposed a fissure over which the ladder of\r\nphysical reasoning is incompetent to carry us.  We must, therefore,\r\naccept the observed association as an empirical fact, without being\r\nable to bring it under the yoke of _à priori_ deduction.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nSuch were the ponderings which ran habitually through my mind in the\r\ndays of my scientific youth.  They illustrate two things--a\r\ndetermination to push physical considerations to their utmost\r\nlegitimate limit; and an acknowledgment that physical considerations\r\ndo not lead to the final explanation of all that we feel and know.\r\nThis acknowledgment, be it said in passing, was by no means made with\r\nthe view of providing room for the play of considerations other than\r\nphysical.  The same intellectual duality, if I may use the phrase,\r\nmanifests itself in the following extract from an article entitled\r\n'Physics and Metaphysics,' published in the 'Saturday Review' for\r\nAugust 4, 1860:\r\n\r\n'The philosophy of the future will assuredly take more account than\r\nthat of the past of the dependence of thought and feeling on physical\r\nprocesses; and it may be that the qualities of the mind will be\r\nstudied through organic combinations as we now study the character of\r\na force through the affections of ordinary matter.  We believe that\r\nevery thought and every feeling has its definite mechanical\r\ncorrelative--that it is accompanied by a certain breaking up and\r\nremarshalling of the atoms of the brain.  This latter process is\r\npurely physical; and were the faculties we now possess sufficiently\r\nexpanded, without the creation of any new faculty, it would doubtless\r\nbe within the range of our augmented powers to infer from the\r\nmolecular state of the brain the character of the thought acting on\r\nit, and, conversely, to infer from the thought the exact molecular\r\ncondition of the brain.  We do not say--and this, as will be seen, is\r\nall-important--that the inference here referred to would be an _à\r\npriori_ one.  But by observing, with the faculties we assume, the state\r\nof the brain and the associated mental affections, both might be so\r\ntabulated side by side that, if one were given, a mere reference to\r\nthe table would declare the other.  Our present powers, it is true,\r\nshrivel into nothingness when brought to bear on such a problem, but\r\nit is because of its complexity and our limits that this is the case.\r\nThe quality of the problem and of our powers are, we believe, so\r\nrelated, that a mere expansion of the latter would enable them to cope\r\nwith the former.  Why, then, in scientific speculation should we turn\r\nour eyes exclusively to the past?  May it not be that a time is\r\ncoming--ages no doubt distant, but still advancing--when the dwellers\r\nupon this fair earth, starting from the gross human brain of to-day as\r\na rudiment, may be able to apply to these mighty questions faculties\r\nof commensurate extent?  Given the requisite expansibility to the\r\npresent senses and intelligence of man--given also the time necessary\r\nfor their expansion--and this high goal may be attained.  Development\r\nis all that is required, and not a change of quality.  There need be\r\nno absolute breach of continuity between us and our loftier brothers\r\nyet to come.\r\n\r\nWe have guarded ourselves against saying that the inferring of thought\r\nfrom material combinations and arrangements would be an inference _à\r\npriori_.  The inference meant would be the same in kind as that which\r\nthe observation of the effects of food and drink upon the mind would\r\nenable us to make, differing only from the latter in the degree of\r\nanalytical insight which we suppose attained.  Given the masses and\r\ndistances of the planets, we can infer the perturbations consequent on\r\ntheir mutual attractions.  Given the nature of a disturbance in water,\r\nair, or aether--knowing the physical qualities of the medium we can\r\ninfer how its particles will be affected.  In all this we deal with\r\nphysical laws.  The mind runs with certainty along the line of thought\r\nwhich connects the phenomena, and from beginning to end there is no\r\nbreak in the chain.  But when we endeavour to pass by a similar\r\nprocess from the phenomena of physics to those of thought, we meet a\r\nproblem which transcends any conceivable expansion of the powers which\r\nwe now possess.  We may think over the subject again and again, but it\r\neludes all intellectual presentation.  We stand at length face to face\r\nwith the Incomprehensible.  The territory of physics is wide, but it\r\nhas its limits from which we look with vacant gaze into the region\r\nbeyond.  Let us follow matter to its utmost bounds, let us claim it in\r\nall its forms--even in the muscles, blood, and brain of man\r\nhimself--as ours to experiment with and to speculate upon.  Casting\r\nthe term \"vital force\" from our vocabulary, let us reduce, if we can,\r\nthe visible phenomena of life to mechanical attractions and\r\nrepulsions. Having thus exhausted physics, and reached its very rim, a\r\nmighty Mystery still looms beyond us.  We have, in fact, made no step\r\ntowards its solution.  And thus it will ever loom, compelling the\r\nphilosophies of successive ages to confess that\r\n\r\n                          \"We are such stuff\r\n    As dreams are made of, and our little life\r\n    Is rounded by a sleep.\"\r\n\r\nIn my work on 'Heat,' published in 1863 and republished many times\r\nsince, I employ the precise language thus extracted from the 'Saturday\r\nReview.'\r\n\r\nThe distinction is here clearly brought out which I had resolved at\r\nall hazards to draw--that, namely, between what men knew or might\r\nknow, and what they could never hope to know.  Impart simple\r\nmagnifying power to our present vision, and the atomic motions of the\r\nbrain itself might be brought into view.  Compare these motions with\r\nthe corresponding states of consciousness, and an empirical nexus\r\nmight be established; but 'we try to soar in a vacuum when we\r\nendeavour to pass by logical deduction from the one to the other.'\r\nAmong these brain-effects a new product appears which defies\r\nmechanical treatment.  We cannot deduce motion from consciousness or\r\nconsciousness from motion as we deduce one motion from another.\r\nNevertheless observation is open to us, and by it relations may be\r\nestablished which are at least as valid as those of the deductive\r\nreason.  The difficulty may really lie in the attempt to convert a\r\ndatum into an inference--an ultimate fact into a product of logic. My\r\ndesire for the moment, however, is not to theorise, but to let facts\r\nspeak in reply to accusation.\r\n\r\nThe most 'materialistic' speculation for which I was responsible,\r\nprior to the 'Belfast Address,' is embodied in the following extract\r\nfrom a brief article written as far back as 1865: 'Supposing the\r\nmolecules of the human body, instead of replacing others, and thus\r\nrenewing a pre-existing form, to be gathered first-hand from nature,\r\nand placed in the exact relative positions which they occupy in the\r\nbody.  Supposing them to have the same forces and distribution of\r\nforces, the same motions and distribution of motions--would this\r\norganised concourse of molecules stand before us as a sentient,\r\nthinking being?  There seems no valid reason to assume that it would\r\nnot.  Or supposing a planet carved from the sun, set spinning round an\r\naxis, and sent revolving round the sun at a distance equal to that of\r\nour earth, would one consequence of the refrigeration of the mass be\r\nthe development of organic forms?  I lean to the affirmative.' This is\r\nplain speaking, but it is without 'dogmatism.' An opinion is\r\nexpressed, a belief, a leaning--not an established 'doctrine.'\r\n\r\nThe burthen of my writings in this connection is as much a recognition\r\nof the weakness of science as an assertion of its strength.  In 1867,\r\nI told the working men of Dundee that while making the largest demand\r\nfor freedom of investigation; while considering science to be alike\r\npowerful as an instrument of intellectual culture, and as a ministrant\r\nto the material wants of men; if asked whether science has solved, or\r\nis likely in our day to solve, 'the problem of the universe,' I must\r\nshake my head in doubt.  I compare the mind of man to a musical\r\ninstrument with a certain range of notes, beyond which in both\r\ndirections exists infinite silence.  The phenomena of matter and force\r\ncome within our intellectual range; but behind, and above, and around\r\nus the real mystery of the universe lies unsolved, and, as far as we\r\nare concerned, is incapable of solution.\r\n\r\nWhile refreshing my mind on these old themes I appear to myself as a\r\nperson possessing one idea, which so over-masters him that he is never\r\nweary of repeating it.  That idea is the polar conception of the\r\ngrandeur and the littleness of man--the vastness of his range in some\r\nrespects and directions, and his powerlessness to take a single step\r\nin others.  In 1868, before the Mathematical and Physical Section of\r\nthe British Association, then assembled at Norwich, I repeat the same\r\nwell-worn note:\r\n\r\n'In thus affirming the growth of the human body to be mechanical, and\r\nthought as exercised by us to have its correlative in the physics of\r\nthe brain, the position of the \"materialist,\" as far as that position\r\nis tenable, is stated.  I think the materialist will be able finally\r\nto maintain this position against all attacks, but I do not think he\r\ncan pass beyond it.  The problem of the connection of body and soul is\r\nas insoluble in its modern form as it was in the pre-scientific ages.\r\nPhosphorus is a constituent of the human brain, and a trenchant German\r\nwriter has exclaimed, \"Ohne Phosphor kein Gedanke!\" That may or may\r\nnot be the case; but, even if we knew it to be the case, the knowledge\r\nwould not lighten our darkness.  On both sides of the zone here\r\nassigned to the materialist, he is equally helpless.  If you ask him\r\nwhence is this \"matter\" of which we have been discoursing--who or what\r\ndivided it into molecules, and impressed upon them this necessity of\r\nrunning into organic forms--he has no answer.  Science is also mute in\r\nregard to such questions.  But if the materialist is confounded and\r\nscience is rendered dumb, who else is prepared with an answer?  Let us\r\nlower our heads and acknowledge our ignorance, priest and philosopher,\r\none and all.'\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe roll of echoes which succeeded the Lecture delivered by Professor\r\nVirchow at Munich on September 22, 1877, was long and loud.  The\r\n'Times' published a nearly full translation of the lecture, and it was\r\neagerly commented on in other journals.  Glances from it to an Address\r\ndelivered by me before the Midland Institute in the autumn of 1877,\r\nand published in this volume, were very frequent.  Professor Virchow\r\nwas held up to me in some quarters as a model of philosophic caution,\r\nwho by his reasonableness reproved my rashness, and by his depth\r\nreproved my shallowness.  With true theologic courtesy I was\r\nsedulously emptied, not only of the 'principles of scientific\r\nthought,' but of 'common modesty' and 'common sense.' And though I am\r\nindebted to Professor Clifford for recalling in the 'Nineteenth\r\nCentury' for April the public mind in this connection from heated\r\nfancy to sober fact, I do not think a brief additional examination of\r\nVirchow's views, and of my relation to them, will be out of place\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe key-note of his position is struck in the preface to the excellent\r\nEnglish translation of his lecture--a preface written expressly by\r\nhimself.  'Nothing,' he says, 'was farther from his intention than any\r\nwish to disparage the great services rendered by Mr. Darwin to the\r\nadvancement of biological science, of which no one has expressed more\r\nadmiration than himself.  On the other hand, it seemed high time to\r\nhim to enter an energetic protest against the attempts that are made\r\nto proclaim the problems of research as actual facts, and the opinions\r\nof scientists as established science.' On the ground, among others,\r\nthat it promotes the pernicious delusions of the Socialist, Virchow\r\nconsiders the theory of evolution dangerous; but his fidelity to truth\r\nis so great that he would brave the danger and teach the theory, if it\r\nwere only proved.  'However dangerous the state of things might be,\r\nlet the confederates be as mischievous as they might, still I do not\r\nhesitate to say that from the moment when we had become convinced that\r\nthe evolution theory was a perfectly established doctrine--so certain\r\nthat we could pledge our oath to it, so sure that we could say, \"Thus\r\nit is\"--from that moment we could not dare to feel any scruple about\r\nintroducing it into our actual life, so as not only to communicate it\r\nto every educated man, but to impart it to every child, to make it the\r\nfoundation of our whole ideas of the world, of society, and the State,\r\nand to base upon it our whole system of education.  This I hold to be\r\na necessity.'\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know the persons designated by the pronoun\r\n'we' in the first sentence of the foregoing quotation.  No doubt\r\nProfessor Haeckel would accept this canon in all its fulness, and\r\nfound on it his justification.  He would say without hesitation: 'I am\r\nconvinced that the theory of evolution is a perfectly established\r\ndoctrine, and hence on your own showing I am justified in urging its\r\nintroduction into our schools.' It is plain, however, that Professor\r\nVirchow would not accept this retort as valid.  His 'we' must cover\r\nsomething more than Professor Haeckel.  It would probably cover more\r\neven than the audience he addressed; for he would hardly affirm, even\r\nif every one of his hearers accepted the theory of evolution, that\r\nthat would be a sufficient warrant for forcing it upon the public at\r\nlarge.  His 'we,' I submit, needs definition.  If he means that the\r\ntheory of evolution ought to be introduced into our schools, not when\r\nexperts are agreed as to its truth, but when the community is prepared\r\nfor its introduction, then, I think, he is right, and that, as a\r\nmatter of social policy, Dr. Haeckel would be wrong in seeking to\r\nantedate the period of its introduction.  In dealing with the\r\ncommunity great changes must have timeliness as well as truth upon\r\ntheir side.  But if the mouths of thinkers be stopped, the necessary\r\nsocial preparation will be impossible; an unwholesome divorce will be\r\nestablished between the expert and the public, and the slow and\r\nnatural process of leavening the social lump by discovery and\r\ndiscussion will be displaced by something far less safe and salutary.\r\n\r\nThe burthen, however, of this celebrated lecture is a warning that a\r\nmarked distinction ought to be made between that which is\r\nexperimentally proved and that which is still in the region of\r\nspeculation.  As to the latter, Virchow by no means imposes silence.\r\nHe is far too sagacious a man to commit himself, at the present time\r\nof day, to any such absurdity.  But he insists that it ought not to be\r\nput on the same evidential level as the former.  'It ought,' as he\r\npoetically expresses it, I to be written in small letters under the\r\ntext.' The audience ought to be warned that the speculative matter is\r\nonly _possible_, not _actual_ truth--that it belongs to the region of\r\n'belief,' and not to that of demonstration.  As long as a problem\r\ncontinues in this speculative stage it would be mischievous, he\r\nconsiders, to teach it in our schools. 'We ought not,' he urges, 'to\r\nrepresent our conjecture as a certainty, nor our hypothesis as a\r\ndoctrine: this is inadmissible.' With regard to the connection between\r\nphysical processes and mental phenomena he says: 'I will, indeed,\r\nwillingly grant that we can find certain gradations, certain definite\r\npoints at which we trace a passage from mental processes to processes\r\npurely physical, or of a physical character.  Throughout this\r\ndiscourse I am not asserting that it will never be possible to bring\r\npsychical processes into an immediate connection with those that are\r\nphysical.  All I say is that we have _at present_ no right to set up\r\nthis _possible_ connection as _a doctrine_ of science.' In the next\r\nparagraph be reiterates his position with reference to the\r\nintroduction of such topics into school teaching.  'We must draw,' he\r\nsays, 'a strict distinction between what we wish to _teach_, and what we\r\nwish to _search for_.  The objects of our research are expressed as\r\nproblems (or hypotheses).  _We need not keep them to ourselves; we are\r\nready to communicate them to all the world_, and say \"There is the\r\nproblem; that is what we strive for.\" ... The investigation of such\r\nproblems, in which the whole nation may be interested, cannot be\r\nrestricted to any one.  This is Freedom of Enquiry.  But the problem\r\n(or hypothesis) is not, without further debate, to be made _a\r\ndoctrine_.'  He will not concede to Dr. Haeckel 'that it is a question\r\nfor the schoolmasters to decide, whether the Darwinian theory of man's\r\ndescent should be at once laid down as the basis of instruction, and\r\nthe protoplastic soul be assumed as the foundation of all ideas\r\nconcerning spiritual being.'  The Professor concludes his lecture thus:\r\n'With perfect truth did Bacon say of old \"_Scientia est potentia_.\" But\r\nhe also defined that knowledge; and the knowledge he meant was not\r\nspeculative knowledge, not the knowledge of hypotheses, but it was\r\nobjective and actual knowledge.  Gentlemen, I think we should be\r\nabusing our power, we should be imperilling our power, unless in our\r\nteaching we restrict ourselves to this perfectly safe and unassailable\r\ndomain.  From this domain _we may make incursions into the field of\r\nproblems_, and I am sure that every venture of that kind will then find\r\nall needful security and support.' I have emphasised by italics two\r\nsentences in the foregoing series of quotations; the other italics are\r\nthe author's own.\r\n\r\nVirchow's position could not be made clearer by any comments of mine\r\nthan he has here made it himself.  That position is one of the highest\r\npractical importance.  Throughout our whole German Fatherland,' he\r\nsays, men are busied in renovating, extending, and developing the\r\nsystem of education, and in inventing fixed forms in which to mould\r\nit.  On the threshold of coming events stands the Prussian law of\r\neducation.  In all the German States larger schools are being built,\r\nnew educational establishments are set up, the universities are\r\nextended, \"higher\" and \"middle\" schools are founded.  Finally comes\r\nthe question, What is to be the chief substance of the teaching?' What\r\nVirchow thinks it ought and ought not to be, is disclosed by the\r\nforegoing quotations.  There ought to be a clear distinction made\r\nbetween science in the state of hypothesis, and science in the state\r\nof fact.  In school teaching the former ought to be excluded.  And, as\r\nhe assumes it to be still in its hypothetical stage, the ban of\r\nexclusion ought, he thinks, to fall upon the theory of evolution.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI now freely offer myself for judgment before the tribunal whose law\r\nis here laid down.  First and foremost, then, I have never advocated\r\nthe introduction of the theory of evolution into our schools.  I\r\nshould even be disposed to resist its introduction before its meaning\r\nhad been better understood and its utility more fully recognised than\r\nit is now by the great body of the community.  The theory ought, I\r\nthink, to bide its time until the free conflict of discovery,\r\nargument, and opinion has won for it this recognition.  A necessary\r\ncondition here, however, is that free discussion should not be\r\nprevented, either by the ferocity of reviewers or the arm of the law;\r\notherwise, as I said before, the work of social preparation cannot go\r\non.  On this count, then, I claim acquittal, being for the moment on\r\nthe side of Virchow.\r\n\r\nBesides the duties of the chair, which I have been privileged to\r\noccupy in London for more than a quarter of a century, and which never\r\ninvolved a word on my part, pro or con, in reference to the theory of\r\nevolution, I have had the honour of addressing audiences in Liverpool,\r\nBelfast, and Birmingham; and in these addresses the theory of\r\nevolution, and the connected doctrine of spontaneous generation, have\r\nbeen more or less touched upon.  Let us now examine whether in my\r\nreferences I have departed from the views of Virchow or not.\r\n\r\nIn the Liverpool discourse, after speaking of the theory of evolution\r\nwhen applied to the primitive condition of matter, as belonging to\r\n'the dim twilight of conjecture,' and affirming that 'the certainty\r\nof experimental enquiry is here shut out,' I sketch the nebular theory\r\nas enunciated by Kant and Laplace, and afterwards proceed thus:\r\n'Accepting some such view of the construction of our system _as\r\nprobable_, a desire immediately arises to connect the present life of\r\nour planet with the past. We wish to know something of our remotest\r\nancestry.  On its first detachment from the sun, life, as we\r\nunderstand it, could not have been present on the earth.  How, then,\r\ndid it come there?  The thing to be encouraged here is a reverent\r\nfreedom--a freedom preceded by the hard discipline which checks\r\nlicentiousness in speculation--while the thing to be repressed, both\r\nin science and out of it, is dogmatism.  And here I am in the hands of\r\nthe meeting, willing to end but ready to go on.  _I have no right to\r\nintrude upon you unasked the unformed notions which are floating like\r\nclouds, or gathering to more solid consistency in the modern\r\nspeculative mind_.'\r\n\r\nI then notice more especially the basis of the theory.  Those who hold\r\nthe doctrine of evolution _are by no means ignorant of the uncertainty\r\nof their data, and they only yield to it a provisional assent_.  They\r\nregard the nebular hypothesis as probable; and, in the utter absence\r\nof any proof of the illegality of the act, they prolong the method of\r\nnature from the present into the past. Here the observed uniformity of\r\nnature is their only guide.  Having determined the elements of their\r\ncurve in a world of observation and experiment, they prolong that\r\ncurve into an antecedent world, and accept as probable the unbroken\r\nsequence of development from the nebula to the present time.' Thus it\r\nappears that, long antecedent to the publication of his advice, I did\r\nexactly what Professor Virchow recommends, showing myself as careful\r\nas he could be not to claim for a scientific doctrine a certainty\r\nwhich did not belong to it.\r\n\r\nI now pass on to the Belfast Address, and will cite at once from it\r\nthe passage which has given rise to the most violent animadversion.\r\n'Believing as I do in the continuity of nature, I cannot stop abruptly\r\nwhere our microscopes cease to be of use.  At this point the vision of\r\nthe mind authoritatively supplements that of the eye.  By an\r\nintellectual necessity I cross the boundary of the experimental\r\nevidence, and discern in that \"matter\" which we, in our ignorance of\r\nits latent powers, and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its\r\nCreator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium, the promise and\r\npotency of all terrestrial life.' Without halting for a moment I go on\r\nto do the precise thing which Professor Virchow declares to be\r\nnecessary.  'If you ask me,' I say, 'whether there exists the least\r\nevidence to prove that any form of life can be developed out of matter\r\nindependently of antecedent life, my reply is that evidence considered\r\nperfectly conclusive by many has been adduced, and that were we to\r\nfollow a common example, and accept testimony because it falls in with\r\nour belief, we should eagerly close with the evidence referred to. But\r\nthere is in the true man of science a desire stronger than the wish to\r\nhave his beliefs upheld; namely, the desire to have them true. And\r\nthose to whom I refer as having studied this question, believing the\r\nevidence offered in favour of \"spontaneous generation\" to be vitiated\r\nby error, cannot accept it.  They know full well that the chemist now\r\nprepares from inorganic matter a vast array of substances, which were\r\nsome time ago regarded as the products solely of vitality. They are\r\nintimately acquainted with the structural power of matter, as\r\nevidenced in the phenomena of crystallisation.  They can justify\r\nscientifically their _belief_ in its potency, under the proper\r\nconditions, to produce organisms.  But, in reply to your question,\r\nthey will frankly admit their inability to point to any satisfactory\r\nexperimental proof that life can be developed, save from demonstrable\r\nantecedent life.' [Footnote: Quoted by Clifford, 'Nineteenth Century,'\r\n3, p. 726.]\r\n\r\nComparing the theory of evolution with other theories, I thus express\r\nmyself: 'The basis of the doctrine of evolution consists, not in an\r\nexperimental demonstration--for the subject is hardly accessible to\r\nthis mode of proof--but in its general harmony with scientific\r\nthought.  From contrast, moreover, it derives enormous relative\r\nstrength.  On the one side we have a theory, which converts the Power\r\nwhose garment is seen in the visible universe into an Artificer,\r\nfashioned after the human model, and acting by broken efforts, as man\r\nis seen to act.  On the other side we have the conception that all we\r\nsee around us and feel within us--the phenomena of physical nature as\r\nwell as those of the human mind--have their unsearchable roots in a\r\ncosmical life, if I dare apply the term, an infinitesimal span of\r\nwhich is offered to the investigation of man.' Among thinking people,\r\nin my opinion, this last conception has a higher ethical value than\r\nthat of a personal artificer.  Be that as it may, I make here no claim\r\nfor the theory of evolution which can reasonably be refused.\r\n\r\n'Ten years have elapsed' said Dr. Hooker at Norwich in 1868 [Footnote:\r\nPresident's Address to the British Association.] 'since the\r\npublication of \"The Origin of Species by Natural Selection,\" and it is\r\ntherefore not too early now to ask what progress that bold theory has\r\nmade in scientific estimation.  Since the \"Origin\" appeared it has\r\npassed through four English editions,' [Footnote: Published by Mr.\r\nJohn Murray, the English publisher of Virchow's Lecture.  Bane and\r\nantidote are thus impartially distributed by the same hand.] two\r\nAmerican, two German, two French, several Russian, a Dutch, and an\r\nItalian edition.  So far from Natural Selection being a thing of the\r\npast [the 'Athenaeum' had stated it to be so] it is an accepted\r\ndoctrine with almost every philosophical naturalist, including, it\r\nwill always be understood, a considerable proportion who are not\r\nprepared to admit that it accounts for all Mr. Darwin assigns to it.'\r\nIn the following year, at Innsbruck, Helmholtz took up the same\r\nground. [Footnote: 'Noch besteht lebhafter Streit um die Wahrheit oder\r\nWahrscheinlichkeit von Darwin's Theorie; er dreht sich aber doch\r\neigentlich nur um die Grenzen, welche wir fuer die Veraenderlichkeit\r\nder Arten annehmen duerfen.  Dass innerhalb derselben Species erbliche\r\nRacenverschiedenheiten auf die von Darwin beschriebene Weise zu kommen\r\nkoennen, ja dass viele der bisher als verschiedene Species derselben\r\nGattung betrachteten Formen von derselben Urform abstammen, werden\r\nauch seine Gegner kaum leugnen.'--(Populaere Vortraege.)]  Another\r\ndecade has now passed, and he is simply blind who cannot see the\r\nenormous progress made by the theory during that time.  Some of the\r\noutward and visible signs of this advance are readily indicated.  The\r\nhostility and fear which so long prevented the recognition of Mr.\r\nDarwin by his own university have vanished, and this year Cambridge,\r\namid universal acclamation, conferred on him her Doctor's degree.  The\r\nAcademy of Sciences in Paris, which had so long persistently closed\r\nits doors against Mr. Darwin, has also yielded at last; while sermons,\r\nlectures, and published articles plainly show that even the clergy\r\nhave, to a great extent, become acclimatised to the Darwinian air.  My\r\nbrief reference to Mr. Darwin in the Birmingham Address was based upon\r\nthe knowledge that such changes had been accomplished, and were still\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nThat the lecture of Professor Virchow can, to any practical extent\r\ndisturb this progress of public faith in the theory of evolution, I do\r\nnot believe.  That the special lessons of caution which he inculcates\r\nwere exemplified by me, years before his voice was heard upon this\r\nsubject, has been proved in the foregoing pages.  In point of fact, if\r\nhe had preceded me instead of following me, and if my desire had been\r\nto incorporate his wishes in my words, I could not have accomplished\r\nthis more completely.  It is possible, moreover, to draw the\r\ncoincident lines still further, for most of what he has said about\r\nspontaneous generation might have been uttered by me.  I share his\r\nopinion that the theory of evolution in its complete form involves the\r\npassage from matter which we now hold to be inorganic into organised\r\nmatter; in other words, involves the assumption that at some period or\r\nother of the earth's history there occurred what would be now called\r\n'spontaneous generation.' I agree with him that the proofs of it are\r\nstill wanting.'  'Whoever,' he says, recalls to mind the lamentable\r\nfailure of all the attempts made very recently to discover a decided\r\nsupport for the _generatio aequivoca_ in the lower forms of transition\r\nfrom the inorganic to the organic world will feel it doubly serious to\r\ndemand that this theory, so utterly discredited, should be in any way\r\naccepted as the basis of all our views of life.' I hold with Virchow\r\nthat the failures have been lamentable, that the doctrine is utterly\r\ndiscredited.  But my position here is so well known that I need not\r\ndwell upon it further.\r\n\r\nWith one special utterance of Professor Virchow his translator\r\nconnects me by name.  'I have no objection,' observes the Professor,\r\n'to your saying that atoms of carbon also possess mind, or that in\r\ntheir connection with the Plastidule company they acquire mind; only I\r\ndo not know how I am to perceive this.' This is substantially what I\r\nhad said seventeen years previously in the 'Saturday Review.' The\r\nProfessor continues: 'If I explain attraction and repulsion as\r\nexhibitions of mind, as psychical phenomena, I simply throw the Psyche\r\nout of the window, and the Psyche ceases to be a Psyche.' I may say,\r\nin passing, that the Psyche that could be cast out of the window is\r\nnot worth houseroom.  At this point the translator, who is evidently a\r\nman of culture, strikes in with a foot-note.  'As an illustration of\r\nProfessor Virchow's meaning, we may quote the conclusion at which\r\nDoctor Tyndall arrives respecting the hypothesis of a human soul,\r\noffered as an explanation or a simplification of a series of obscure\r\nphenomena--psychical phenomena, as he calls them.  \"If you are\r\ncontent to make your soul a poetic rendering of a phenomenon which\r\nrefuses the yoke of ordinary physical laws, I, for one, would not\r\nobject to this exercise of ideality.\"' [Footnote: 'Presidential\r\nAddress delivered before the Birmingham and Midland Institute, October\r\n1, 1877.  Fortnightly Review,' Nov. 1, 1877, p. 60]  Professor\r\nVirchow's meaning, I admit, required illustration; but I do not\r\nclearly see how the quotation from me subserves this purpose.  I do\r\nnot even know whether I am cited as meriting praise or deserving\r\nopprobrium.  In a far coarser fashion this utterance of mine has been\r\ndealt with in other places: it may therefore be worth while to spend a\r\nfew words upon it.\r\n\r\nThe sting of a wasp at the finger-end announces itself to the brain as\r\npain.  The impression made by the sting travels, in the first place,\r\nwith comparative slowness along the nerves affected; and only when it\r\nreaches the brain have we the fact of consciousness.  Those who think\r\nmost profoundly on this subject hold that a chemical change, which,\r\nstrictly interpreted, is atomic motion, is, in such a case, propagated\r\nalong the nerve, and communicated to the brain.  Again, on feeling the\r\nsting I flap the insect violently away.  What has caused this motion\r\nof my hand?  The command from the brain to remove the insect travels\r\nalong the motor nerves to the proper muscles, and, their force being\r\nunlocked, they perform the work demanded of them.  But what moved the\r\nnerve molecules which unlocked the muscle?  The sense of pain, it may\r\nbe replied.  But how can a sense of pain, or any other state of\r\nconsciousness, make matter move?  Not all the sense of pain or\r\npleasure in the world could lift a stone or move a billiard-ball; why\r\nshould it stir a molecule?  Try to express the motion numerically in\r\nterms of the sensation, and the difficulty immediately appears.  Hence\r\nthe idea long ago entertained by philosophers, but lately brought into\r\nspecial prominence, that the physical processes are complete in\r\nthemselves, and would go on just as they do if consciousness were not\r\nat all implicated.  Consciousness, on this view, is a kind of\r\nby-product inexpressible in terms of force and motion, and unessential\r\nto the molecular changes going on in the brain.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, I wrote thus: 'Do states of consciousness enter as\r\nlinks into the chain of antecedence and sequence, which gives rise to\r\nbodily actions?  Speaking for myself, it is certain that I have no\r\npower of imagining such states interposed between the molecules of the\r\nbrain, and influencing the transference of motion among the molecules.\r\nThe thing \"eludes all mental presentation.\" Hence an iron strength\r\nseems to belong to the logic which claims for the brain an automatic\r\naction uninfluenced by consciousness.  But it is, I believe, admitted\r\nby those who hold the automaton theory, that states of consciousness\r\nare produced by the motion of the molecules of the brain; and this\r\nproduction of consciousness by molecular motion is to me quite as\r\nunpresentable to the mental vision as the production of molecular\r\nmotion by consciousness.  If I reject one result I must reject both.\r\nI, however, reject neither, and thus stand in the presence of two\r\nIncomprehensibles, instead of one Incomprehensible.' Here I secede\r\nfrom the automaton theory, though maintained by friends who have all\r\nmy esteem, and fall back upon the avowal which occurs with such\r\nwearisome iteration throughout the foregoing pages; namely, my own\r\nutter incapacity to grasp the problem.\r\n\r\nThis avowal is repeated with emphasis in the passage to which\r\nProfessor Virchow's translator draws attention.  What, I there\r\nask, is the causal connection between the objective and the\r\nsubjective--between molecular motions and states of consciousness?\r\nMy answer is: I do not see the connection, nor am I acquainted with\r\nanybody who does.  It is no explanation to say that the objective\r\nand subjective are two sides of one and the same phenomenon.\r\nWhy should the phenomenon have two sides?  This is the very core\r\nof the difficulty.  There are plenty of molecular motions which\r\ndo exhibit this two-sidedness.  Does water think or feel when it\r\nruns into frost-ferns upon a window pane?  If not, why should\r\nthe molecular motion of the brain be yoked to this mysterious\r\ncompanion--consciousness?  We can form a coherent picture of all the\r\npurely physical processes--the stirring of the brain, the thrilling of\r\nthe nerves, the discharging of the muscles, and all the subsequent\r\nmotions of the organism.  We are here dealing with mechanical problems\r\nwhich are mentally presentable.\r\n\r\nBut we can form no picture of the process whereby consciousness\r\nemerges, either as a necessary link, or as an accidental by-product,\r\nof this series of actions.  The reverse process of the production of\r\nmotion by consciousness is equally unpresentable to the mind.  We are\r\nhere in fact on the boundary line of the intellect, where the ordinary\r\ncanons of science fail to extricate us.  If we are true to these\r\ncanons, we must deny to subjective phenomena all influence on physical\r\nprocesses.  The mechanical philosopher, as such, will never place a\r\nstate of consciousness and a group of molecules in the relation of\r\nmover and moved.  Observation proves them to interact; but, in passing\r\nfrom the one to the other, we meet a blank which the logic of\r\ndeduction is unable to fill.  This, the reader will remember, is the\r\nconclusion at which I had arrived more than twenty years ago.  I lay\r\nbare unsparingly the central difficulty of the materialist, and tell\r\nhim that the facts of observation which he considers so simple are\r\n'almost as difficult to be seized mentally as the idea of a soul.' I go\r\nfurther, and say, in effect, to those who wish to retain this idea,\r\n'If you abandon the interpretations of grosser minds, who image the\r\nsoul as a Psyche which could be thrown out of the window--an entity\r\nwhich is usually occupied, we know not how, among the molecules of the\r\nbrain, but which on due occasion, such as the intrusion of a bullet or\r\nthe blow of a club, can fly away into other regions of space--if,\r\nabandoning this heathen notion, you consent to approach the subject in\r\nthe only way in which approach is possible--if you consent to make\r\nyour soul a poetic rendering of a phenomenon which, as I have taken\r\nmore pains than anybody else to show you, refuses the yoke of ordinary\r\nphysical laws--then I, for one, would not object to this exercise of\r\nideality.' I say it strongly, but with good temper, that the\r\ntheologian, or the defender of theology, who hacks and scourges me for\r\nputting the question in this light is guilty of black ingratitude.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the agreement thus far pointed out, there are certain\r\npoints in Professor Virchow's lecture to which I should feel inclined\r\nto take exception.  I think it was hardly necessary to associate the\r\ntheory of evolution with Socialism; it may be even questioned whether\r\nit was correct to do so.  As Lange remarks, the aim of Socialism, or\r\nof its extreme leaders, is to overthrow the existing systems of\r\ngovernment, and anything that helps them to this end is welcomed,\r\nwhether it be atheism or papal infallibility.  For long years the\r\nSocialists saw Church and State united against them, and both were\r\ntherefore regarded with a common hatred.  But no sooner does a serious\r\ndifference arise between Church and State, than a portion of the\r\nSocialists begin immediately to dally with the former. [Footnote:\r\n'Geschichte des Materialismus,' 2e Auflage, vol. ii. p. 538.]  The\r\nexperience of the last German elections illustrates Lange's position.\r\nFar nobler and truer to my mind than this fear of promoting Socialism\r\nby a scientific theory which the best and soberest heads in the world\r\nhave substantially accepted, is the position assumed by Helmholtz, who\r\nin his 'Popular Lectures' describes Darwin's theory as embracing 'an\r\nessentially new creative thought' (einen wesentlich neuen\r\nschoepferischen Gedanken), and who illustrates the greatness of this\r\nthought by copious references to the solutions, previously undreamt\r\nof, which it offers of the enigmas of life and organisation.  He\r\npoints to the clouds of error and confusion which it has already\r\ndispersed, and shows how the progress of discovery since its first\r\nenunciation is simply a record of the approach of the theory towards\r\ncomplete demonstration.  One point in this 'popular' exposition\r\ndeserves especial mention here.  Helmholtz refers to the dominant\r\nposition acquired by Germany in physiology and medicine, while other\r\nnations have kept abreast of her in the investigation of inorganic\r\nnature.  He claims for German men the credit of pursuing with\r\nunflagging and self-denying industry, with purely ideal aims, and\r\nwithout any immediate prospect of practical utility, the cultivation\r\nof pure science.  But that which has determined German superiority in\r\nthe fields referred to was, in his opinion, something different from\r\nthis.  Enquiries into the nature of life are intimately connected with\r\npsychological and ethical questions; and he claims for his countrymen\r\na greater fearlessness of the consequences which a full knowledge of\r\nthe truth may here carry along with it, than reigns among the\r\nenquirers of other nations.  And why is this the case?  'England and\r\nFrance,' he says, 'possess distinguished investigators--men competent\r\nto follow up and illustrate with vigorous energy the methods of\r\nnatural science; but they have hitherto been compelled to bend before\r\nsocial and theological prejudices, and could only utter their\r\nconvictions under the penalty of injuring their social influence and\r\nusefulness.  Germany has gone forward more courageously.  She has\r\ncherished the trust, which has never been deceived, that complete\r\ntruth carries with it the antidote against the bane and danger which\r\nfollow in the train of half knowledge.  A cheerfully laborious and\r\ntemperate people--a people morally strong--can well afford to look\r\ntruth full in the face.  Nor are they to be ruined by the enunciation\r\nof one-sided theories, even when these may appear to threaten the\r\nbases of society.' These words of Helmholtz are, in my opinion, wiser\r\nand more applicable to the condition of Germany at the present moment\r\nthan those which express the fears of Professor Virchow.  It will be\r\nremembered that at the time of his lecture his chief anxieties were\r\ndirected towards France; but France has since that time given ample\r\nevidence of her ability to crush, not only Socialists, but\r\nanti-Socialists, who would impose on her a yoke which she refuses to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nIn close connection with these utterances of Helmholtz, I place\r\nanother utterance not less noble, which I trust was understood and\r\nappreciated by those to whom it was addressed.  'If,' said the\r\nPresident of the British Association in his opening address in Dublin,\r\nwe could lay down beforehand the precise limits of possible knowledge,\r\nthe problem of physical science would be already half solved.  But the\r\nquestion to which the scientific explorer has often to address himself\r\nis, not merely whether he is able to solve this or that problem; but\r\nwhether he can so far unravel the tangled threads of the matter with\r\nwhich he has to deal, as to weave them into a definite problem at\r\nall ... If his eye seem dim, he must look steadfastly and with hope\r\ninto the misty vision, until the very clouds wreathe themselves into\r\ndefinite forms.  If his ear seem dull, he must listen patiently and\r\nwith sympathetic trust to the intricate whisperings of Nature--the\r\ngoddess, as she has been called, of a hundred voices--until here and\r\nthere he can pick out a few simple notes to which his own powers can\r\nresound.  If, then, at a moment when he finds himself placed on a\r\npinnacle from which he is called upon to take a perspective survey of\r\nthe range of science, and to tell us what he can see from his vantage\r\nground; if at such a moment after straining his gaze to the very verge\r\nof the horizon, and after describing the most distant of well-defined\r\nobjects, he should give utterance also to some of the subjective\r\nimpressions which he is conscious of receiving from regions beyond; if\r\nhe should depict possibilities which seem opening to his view; if he\r\nshould explain why he thinks this a mere blind alley and that an open\r\npath; _then the fault and the loss would be alike ours if we refused to\r\nlisten calmly, and temperately to form our own judgment on what we\r\nhear; then assuredly it is we who would be committing the error of\r\nconfounding matters of fact with matters of opinion, if we failed to\r\ndiscriminate between the various elements contained in such a\r\ndiscourse, and assumed that they had been all put on the same\r\nfooting_.'\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWhile largely agreeing with him, I cannot quite accept the setting in\r\nwhich Professor Virchow places the confessedly abortive attempts to\r\nsecure an experimental basis for the doctrine of spontaneous\r\ngeneration.  It is not a doctrine 'so discredited' that some of the\r\nscientific thinkers of England accept 'as the basis of all their\r\nviews of life.' Their induction is by no means thus limited.  They\r\nhave on their side more than the 'reasonable probability' deemed\r\nsufficient by Bishop Butler for practical guidance in the gravest\r\naffairs, that the members of the solar system which are now discrete\r\nonce formed a continuous mass; that in the course of untold ages,\r\nduring which the work of condensation, through the waste of heat in\r\nspace, went on, the planets were detached; and that our present sun is\r\nthe residual nucleus of the flocculent or gaseous ball from which the\r\nplanets were successively separated.  Life, as we define it, was not\r\npossible for aeons subsequent to this separation.  When and how did it\r\nappear?  I have already pressed this question, but have received no\r\nanswer. [Footnote: In the 'Apology for the Belfast Address,' the\r\nquestion is reasoned out.]  If, with Professor Knight, we regard the\r\nBible account of the introduction of life upon the earth as a poem,\r\nnot as a statement of fact, where are we to seek for guidance as to\r\nthe fact?  There does not exist a barrier possessing the strength of a\r\ncobweb to oppose to the hypothesis, which ascribes the appearance of\r\nlife to that 'potency of matter' which finds expression in natural\r\nevolution. [Footnote: 'We feel it an undeniable necessity,' says\r\nProfessor Virchow, not to sever the organic world from the whole, as\r\nif it were something disjoined from the whole.' This grave statement\r\ncannot be weakened by the subsequent pleasantry regarding 'Carbon &\r\nCo.']\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is not without its difficulties, but they vanish when\r\ncompared with those which encumber its rivals.  There are various\r\nfacts in science obviously connected, and whose connections we are\r\nunable to trace; but we do not think of filling the gap between them\r\nby the intrusion of a separable spiritual agent.  In like manner\r\nthough we are unable to trace the course of things from the nebula,\r\nwhen there was no life in our sense, to the present earth where life\r\nabounds, the spirit and practice of science pronounce against the\r\nintrusion of an anthropomorphic creator.  Theologians must liberate\r\nand refine their conceptions or be prepared for the rejection of them\r\nby thoughtful minds.  It is they, not we, who lay claim to knowledge\r\nnever given to man.  Our refusal of the creative hypothesis is less an\r\nassertion of knowledge than a protest against the assumption of\r\nknowledge which must long, if not always, lie beyond us, and the claim\r\nto which is a source of perpetual confusion.' At the same time, when I\r\nlook with strenuous gaze into the whole problem as far as my\r\ncapacities allow, overwhelming wonder is the predominant feeling. This\r\nwonder has come to me from the ages just as much as my understanding,\r\nand it has an equal right to satisfaction.  Hence I say, if,\r\nabandoning your illegitimate claim to knowledge, you place, with Job,\r\nyour forehead in the dust and acknowledge the authorship of this\r\nuniverse to be past finding out--if, having made this confession, and\r\nrelinquished the views of the mechanical theologian, you desire for\r\nthe satisfaction of feelings which I admit to be, in great part, those\r\nof humanity at large, to give ideal form to the Power that moves all\r\nthings--it is not by me that you will find objections raised to this\r\nexercise of ideality, if it be only consciously and worthily carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAgain, I think Professor Virchow's position, in regard to the question\r\nof _contagium animatum_, is not altogether that of true philosophy.  He\r\npoints to the antiquity of the doctrine.  'It is lost,' he says, 'in\r\nthe darkness of the middle ages.  We have received this name from our\r\nforefathers, and it already appears distinctly in the sixteenth\r\ncentury.  We possess several works of that time which put forward\r\n_contagium animatum_ as a scientific doctrine, with the same confidence,\r\nwith the same sort of proof, with which the \"Plastidulic soul\" is now\r\nset forth.'\r\n\r\nThese speculations of our 'forefathers' will appeal differently to\r\ndifferent minds.  By some they will be dismissed with a sneer; to\r\nothers they will appeal as proofs of genius on the part of those who\r\nenunciated them.  There are men, and by no means the minority, who,\r\nhowever wealthy in regard to facts, can never rise into the region of\r\nprinciples; and they are sometimes intolerant of those who can.  They\r\nare formed to plod meritoriously on the lower levels of thought,\r\nunpossessed of the pinions necessary to reach the heights. They cannot\r\nrealise the mental act--the act of inspiration it might well be\r\ncalled--by which a man of genius, after long pondering and proving,\r\nreaches a theoretic conception which unravels and illuminates the\r\ntangle of centuries of observation and experiment.  There are minds,\r\nit may be said in passing, who at the present moment stand in this\r\nrelation to Mr. Darwin.  For my part, I should be inclined to ascribe\r\nto penetration rather than to presumption the notion of a _contagium\r\nanimatum_.  He who invented the term ought, I think, to be held in\r\nesteem; for he had before him the quantity of fact, and the measure of\r\nanalogy, that would justify a man of genius in taking a step so bold.\r\n'Nevertheless,' says Professor Virchow, 'no one was able throughout\r\na long time to discover these living germs of disease. The sixteenth\r\ncentury did not find them, nor did the seventeenth, nor the\r\neighteenth.' But it may be urged, in reply to this, that the theoretic\r\nconjecture often legitimately comes first. It is the forecast of\r\ngenius which anticipates the fact and constitutes a spur towards its\r\ndiscovery.  If, instead of being a spur, the theoretic guess rendered\r\nmen content with imperfect knowledge, it would be a thing to be\r\ndeprecated.  But in modern investigation this is distinctly not the\r\ncase; Darwin's theory, for example, like the undulatory theory, has\r\nbeen a motive power and not an anodyne.  'At last,' continues\r\nProfessor Virchow, 'in the nineteenth century we have begun little by\r\nlittle really to find _contagia animata_.' So much the more honour, I\r\ninfer, is due to those who, three centuries in advance, so put\r\ntogether the facts and analogies of contagious disease as to divine\r\nits root and character.  Professor Virchow seems to deprecate the\r\n'obstinacy' with which this notion of a _contagium vivum_ emerged. Here\r\nI should not be inclined to follow him; because I do not know, nor\r\ndoes he tell me, how much the discovery of facts in the nineteenth\r\ncentury is indebted to the stimulus derived from the theoretic\r\ndiscussions of preceding centuries.  The genesis of scientific ideas\r\nis a subject of profound interest and importance.  He would be but a\r\npoor philosopher who would sever modern chemistry from the efforts of\r\nthe alchemists, who would detach modern atomic doctrines from the\r\nspeculations of Lucretius and his predecessors, or who would claim for\r\nour present knowledge of _contagia_ an origin altogether independent of\r\nthe efforts of our 'forefathers' to penetrate this enigma.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nFinally, I do not know that I should agree with Professor Virchow as\r\nto what a theory is or ought to be.  I call a theory a principle or\r\nconception of the mind which accounts for observed facts, and which\r\nhelps us to look for and predict facts not yet observed.  Every new\r\ndiscovery which fits into a theory strengthens it.  The theory is not\r\na thing complete from the first, but a thing which grows, as it were\r\nasymptotically, towards certainty.  Darwin's theory, as pointed out\r\nnine and ten years ago by Helmholtz and Hooker, was then exactly in\r\nthis condition of growth; and had they to speak of the subject to-day\r\nthey would be able to announce an enormous strengthening of the\r\ntheoretic fibre.  Fissures in continuity which then existed, and which\r\nleft little hope of being ever spanned, have been since filled in, so\r\nthat the further the theory is tested the more fully does it harmonise\r\nwith progressive experience and discovery.  We shall probably never\r\nfill all the gaps; but this will not prevent a profound belief in the\r\ntruth of the theory from taking root in the general mind.  Much less\r\nwill it justify a total denial of the theory.  The man of science who\r\nassumes in such a case the position of a denier is sure to be stranded\r\nand isolated.  The proper attitude, in my opinion, is to give to the\r\ntheory during the phases of its growth as nearly as possible a\r\nproportionate assent; and, if it be a theory which influences\r\npractice, our wisdom is to follow its probable suggestions where more\r\nthan probability is for the moment unattainable.  I write thus with\r\nthe theory of _contagium vivum_, more especially in my mind, and must\r\nregret the attitude of denial assumed by Professor Virchow towards\r\nthat theory.  'I must beg my friend Klebs to pardon me,' he says, 'if,\r\nnotwithstanding the late advances made by the doctrine of infectious\r\nfungi, I still persist in my reserve so far as to admit only the\r\nfungus which is really proved while I deny all other fungi so long as\r\nthey are not actually brought before me.' Professor Virchow, that is\r\nto say, will continue to deny the Germ Theory, however great the\r\nprobabilities on its side, however numerous be the cases of which it\r\nrenders a just account, until it has ceased to be a theory at all, and\r\nhas become a congeries of sensible facts.  Had he said, 'As long as a\r\nsingle fungus of disease remains to be discovered, it is your bounden\r\nduty to search for it,' I should cordially agree with him.  But by his\r\nunreserved denial he quenches the light of probability which ought to\r\nguide the practice of the medical man. Both here and in relation to\r\nthe theory of evolution excess upon one side has begotten excess upon\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\nNOTE.--As might have been expected, Professor Virchow, shows himself\r\nin practice far too sound a philosopher to be restricted by the canon\r\nlaid down in his critique of Dr. Haeckel.  In his recent discourse\r\nupon the plague, he asks and answers the question, 'What is the\r\n_contagium_?' in the following words: 'Et qu'est-ce que le _contagium_? A\r\nmon avis, l'analogie de la peste aver le charbon contagieux me paraît\r\nsi grande qu'il me semble possible de trouver un organisme\r\nmicroscopique qui contient le germe de l'affection.  Mais jusqu' à\r\nprésent on a peu cherché à trouver cet organisme.'--Revue\r\nScientifique, March, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nXVI.  THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A discourse delivered at the Royal Institution of Great\r\nBritain on Friday, January 17, 1879, and introduced here as the latest\r\nFragment.]\r\n\r\nTHE subject of this evening's discourse was proposed by our late\r\nhonorary secretary. [Footnote: Mr. William Spottiswoode, now President\r\nof the Royal Society]  That word 'late' has for me its own\r\nconnotations.  It implies, among other things, the loss of a comrade\r\nby whose side I have worked for thirteen years.  On the other hand,\r\nregret is not without its opposite in the feeling with which I have\r\nseen him rise by sheer intrinsic merit, moral and intellectual, to the\r\nhighest official position which it is in the power of English science\r\nto bestow.  Well, he, whose constant desire and practice were to\r\npromote the interests and extend the usefulness of this institution,\r\nthought that at a time when the electric light occupied so much of\r\npublic attention, a few sound notions regarding it, on the more purely\r\nscientific side, might, to use his own pithy expression, be 'planted'\r\nin the public mind.  I am here to-night with the view of trying, to\r\nthe best of my ability, to realise the idea of our friend.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800, Volta announced his immortal discovery of the pile.\r\nWhetted to eagerness by the previous conflict between him and Galvani,\r\nthe scientific men of the age flung themselves with ardour upon the\r\nnew discovery, repeating Volta's experiments, and extending them in\r\nmany ways.  The light and heat of the voltaic circuit attracted marked\r\nattention, and in the innumerable tests and trials to which this\r\nquestion was subjected, the utility of platinum and charcoal as means\r\nof exalting the light was on all hands recognised.  Mr. Children, with\r\na battery surpassing in strength all its predecessors, fused platinum\r\nwires eighteen inches long, while 'points of charcoal produced a light\r\nso vivid that the sunshine, compared with it, appeared feeble.'\r\n[Footnote: Davy, 'Chemical Philosophy,' p. 110.]  Such effects\r\nreached their culmination when, in 1808, through the liberality of a\r\nfew members of the Royal Institution, Davy was enabled to construct a\r\nbattery of two thousand pairs of plates, with which he afterwards\r\nobtained calorific and luminous effects far transcending anything\r\npreviously observed.  The arc of flame between the carbon terminals\r\nwas four inches long, and by its heat quartz, sapphire, magnesia, and\r\nlime, were melted like wax in a candle flame; while fragments of\r\ndiamond and plumbago rapidly disappeared as if reduced to vapour.\r\n[Footnote: In the concluding lecture at the Royal Institution in June,\r\n1810, Davy showed the action of this battery.  He then fused iridium,\r\nthe alloy of iridium and osmium, and other refractory substances.\r\n'Philosophical Magazine,' vol. xxxv. p. 463.  Quetelet assigns the\r\nfirst production of the spark between coal-points to Curtet in 1802.\r\nDavy certainly in that year showed the carbon light with a battery of\r\n150 pairs of plates in the theatre of the Royal Institution ('Jour.\r\nRoy. Inst.' vol. i. p. 166).]\r\n\r\nThe first condition to be fulfilled in the development of heat and\r\nlight by the electric current is that it shall encounter and overcome\r\nresistance.  Flowing through a perfect conductor, no matter what the\r\nstrength of the current might be, neither heat nor light could be\r\ndeveloped.  A rod of unresisting copper carries away uninjured and\r\nunwarmed an atmospheric discharge competent to shiver to splinters a\r\nresisting oak.  I send the self-same current through a wire composed\r\nof alternate lengths of silver and platinum.  The silver offers little\r\nresistance, the platinum offers much.  The consequence is that the\r\nplatinum is raised to a white heat, while the silver is not visibly\r\nwarmed.  The same holds good with regard to the carbon terminals\r\nemployed for the production of the electric light.  The interval\r\nbetween them offers a powerful resistance to the passage of the\r\ncurrent, and it is by the gathering up of the force necessary to burst\r\nacross this interval that the voltaic current is able to throw the\r\ncarbon into that state of violent intestine commotion which we call\r\nheat, and to which its effulgence is due.  The smallest interval of\r\nair usually suffices to stop the current.  But when the carbon points\r\nare first brought together and then separated, there occurs between\r\nthem a discharge of incandescent matter which carries, or may carry,\r\nthe current over a considerable space.  The light comes almost wholly\r\nfrom the incandescent carbons.  The space between them is filled with\r\na blue flame which, being usually bent by the earth's magnetism,\r\nreceives the name of the Voltaic Arc. [Footnote: The part played by\r\nresistance is strikingly illustrated by the deportment of silver and\r\nthallium when mixed together and volatilised in the arc.  The current\r\nfirst selects as its carrier the most volatile metal, which in this\r\ncase is thallium.  While it continues abundant, the passage of the\r\ncurrent is so free--the resistance to it is so small--that the heat\r\ngenerated is incompetent to volatilise the silver.  As the thallium\r\ndisappears the current is forced to concentrate its power; it presses\r\nthe silver into its service, and finally fills the space between the\r\ncarbons with a vapour which, as long as the necessary resistance is\r\nabsent, it is incompetent to produce.  I have on a former occasion\r\ndrawn attention to a danger which besets the spectroscopist when\r\noperating upon a mixture of constituents volatile in different\r\ndegrees.  When, in 1872, I first observed the effect here described,\r\nhad I not known that silver was present, I should have inferred its\r\nabsence.]\r\n\r\nFor seventy years, then, we have been in possession of this\r\ntranscendent light without applying it to the illumination of our\r\nstreets and houses.  Such applications suggested themselves at the\r\noutset, but there were grave difficulties in their way.  The first\r\ndifficulty arose from the waste of the carbons, which are dissipated\r\nin part by ordinary combustion, and in part by the electric transfer\r\nof matter from the one carbon to the other.  To keep the carbons at\r\nthe proper distance asunder regulators were devised, the earliest, I\r\nbelieve, by Staite, and the most successful by Duboscq, Foucault, and\r\nSerrin, who have been succeeded by Holmes, Siemens, Browning, Carré,\r\nGramme, Lontin, and others.  By such arrangements the first difficulty\r\nwas practically overcome; but the second, a graver one, is probably\r\ninseparable from the construction of the voltaic battery.  It arises\r\nfrom the operation of that inexorable law which throughout the\r\nmaterial universe demands an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\r\nrefusing to yield the faintest glow of heat or glimmer of light\r\nwithout the expenditure of an absolutely equal quantity of some other\r\npower.  Hence, in practice, the desirability of any transformation\r\nmust depend upon the value of the product in relation to that of the\r\npower expended.  The metal zinc can be burnt like paper; it might be\r\nignited in a flame, but it is possible to avoid the introduction of\r\nall foreign heat and to burn the zinc in air of the temperature of\r\nthis room.  This is done by placing zinc foil at the focus of a\r\nconcave mirror, which concentrates to a point the divergent electric\r\nbeam, but which does not warm the air.  The zinc burns at the focus\r\nwith a violet flame, and we could readily determine the amount of heat\r\ngenerated by its combustion.  But zinc can be burnt not only in air\r\nbut in liquids.  It is thus burnt when acidulated water is poured over\r\nit; it is also thus burnt in the voltaic battery.  Here, however, to\r\nobtain the oxygen necessary for its combustion, the zinc has to\r\ndislodge the hydrogen with which the oxygen is combined.  The\r\nconsequence is that the heat due to the combustion of the metal in the\r\nliquid falls short of that developed by its combustion in air, by the\r\nexact quantity necessary to separate the oxygen from the hydrogen.\r\nFully four-fifths of the total heat are used up in this molecular\r\nwork, only one-fifth remaining to warm the battery.  It is upon this\r\nresidue that we must now fix our attention, for it is solely out of it\r\nthat we manufacture our electric light.\r\n\r\nBefore you are two small voltaic batteries of ten cells each.  The two\r\nends of one of them are united by a thick copper wire, while into the\r\ncircuit of the other a thin platinum wire is introduced.  The platinum\r\nglows with a white heat, while the copper wire is not sensibly warmed.\r\nNow an ounce of zinc, like an ounce of coal, produces by its complete\r\ncombustion in air a constant quantity of heat.  The total heat\r\ndeveloped by an ounce of zinc through its union with oxygen in the\r\nbattery is also absolutely invariable.  Let our two batteries, then,\r\ncontinue in action until an ounce of zinc in each of them is consumed.\r\nIn the one case the heat generated is purely domestic, being liberated\r\non the hearth where the fuel is burnt, that is to say in the cells of\r\nthe battery itself.  In the other case, the heat is in part domestic\r\nand in part foreign--in part within the battery and in part outside.\r\nOne of the fundamental truths to be borne in mind is that the sum of\r\nthe foreign and domestic--of the external and internal--heats is fixed\r\nand invariable.  Hence, to have heat outside, you must draw upon the\r\nheat within.  These remarks apply to the electric light.  By the\r\ninter-mediation of the electric current the moderate warmth of the\r\nbattery is not only carried away, but concentrated, so as to produce,\r\nat any distance from its origin, a heat next in order to that of the\r\nsun.  The current might therefore be defined as the swift carrier of\r\nheat.  Loading itself here with invisible power, by a process of\r\ntransmutation which outstrips the dreams of the alchemist, it can\r\ndischarge its load, in the fraction of a second, as light and heat, at\r\nthe opposite side of the world.\r\n\r\nThus, the light and heat produced outside the battery are derived from\r\nthe metallic fuel burnt within the battery; and, as zinc happens to be\r\nan expensive fuel, though we have possessed the electric light for\r\nmore than seventy years, it has been too costly to come into general\r\nuse.  But within these walls, in the autumn of 1831, Faraday\r\ndiscovered a new source of electricity, which we have now to\r\ninvestigate.  On the table before me lies a coil of covered copper\r\nwire, with its ends disunited.  I lift one side of the coil from the\r\ntable, and in doing so exert the muscular effort necessary to overcome\r\nthe simple weight of the coil.  I unite its two ends and repeat the\r\nexperiment.  The effort now required, if accurately measured, would be\r\nfound greater than before.  In lifting the coil I cut the lines of the\r\nearth's magnetic force, such cutting, as proved by Faraday, being\r\nalways accompanied, in a closed conductor, by the production of an\r\n'induced' electric current which, as long as the ends of the coil\r\nremained separate, had no circuit through which it could pass.  The\r\ncurrent here evoked subsides immediately as heat; this heat being the\r\nexact equivalent of the excess of effort just referred to as over and\r\nabove that necessary to overcome the simple weight of the coil.  When\r\nthe coil is liberated it falls back to the table, and when its ends\r\nare united it encounters a resistance over and above that of the air.\r\nIt generates an electric current opposed in direction to the first,\r\nand reaches the table with a diminished shock.  The amount of the\r\ndiminution is accurately represented by the warmth which the momentary\r\ncurrent developer in the coil.  Various devices were employed to exalt\r\nthese induced currents, among which the instruments of Pixii, Clarke,\r\nand Saxton were long conspicuous.  Faraday, indeed, foresaw that such\r\nattempts were sure to be made; but he chose to leave them in the hands\r\nof the mechanician, while he himself pursued the deeper study of facts\r\nand principles.  'I have rather,' he writes in 1831, 'been desirous\r\nof discovering new facts and new relations dependent on\r\nmagneto-electric induction, than of exalting the force of those\r\nalready obtained; being assured that the latter would find their full\r\ndevelopment hereafter.'\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty years magneto-electricity had subserved its first\r\nand noblest purpose of augmenting our knowledge of the powers of\r\nnature.  It had been discovered and applied to intellectual ends, its\r\napplication to practical ends being still unrealised.  The Drummond\r\nlight had raised thoughts and hopes of vast improvements in public\r\nillumination.  Many inventors tried to obtain it cheaply; and in 1853\r\nan attempt was made to organise a company in Paris for the purpose of\r\nprocuring, through the decomposition of water by a powerful\r\nmagneto-electric machine constructed by M. Nollet, the oxygen and\r\nhydrogen necessary for the lime light.  The experiment failed, but the\r\napparatus by which it was attempted suggested to Mr. Holmes other and\r\nmore hopeful applications.  Abandoning the attempt to produce the lime\r\nlight, with persevering skill Holmes continued to improve the\r\napparatus and to augment its power, until it was finally able to yield\r\na magneto-electric light comparable to that of the voltaic battery.\r\nJudged by later knowledge, this first machine would be considered\r\ncumbrous and defective in the extreme; but judged by the light of\r\nantecedent events, it marked a great step forward.\r\n\r\nFaraday was profoundly interested in the growth of his own discovery.\r\nThe Elder Brethren of the Trinity House had had the wisdom to make him\r\ntheir 'Scientific Adviser;' and it is interesting to notice in his\r\nreports regarding the light, the mixture of enthusiasm and caution\r\nwhich characterised him.  Enthusiasm was with him a motive power,\r\nguided and controlled by a disciplined judgment.  He rode it as a\r\ncharger, holding it in by a strong rein.  While dealing with Holmes,\r\nhe states the case of the light pro and con.  He checks the ardour of\r\nthe inventor, and, as regards cost, rejecting sanguine estimates, he\r\ninsists over and over again on the necessity of continued experiment\r\nfor the solution of this important question.  His matured opinion was,\r\nhowever, strongly in favour of the light.  With reference to an\r\nexperiment made at the South Foreland on the 20th of April, 1859, he\r\nthus expresses himself: 'The beauty of the light was wonderful.  At\r\na mile off, the Apparent streams of light issuing from the lantern\r\nwere twice as long as those from the lower lighthouse, and apparently\r\nthree or four times as bright.  The horizontal plane in which they\r\nchiefly took their way made all above or below it black.  The tops of\r\nthe bills, the churches, and the houses illuminated by it were\r\nstriking in their effect upon the eye.' Further on in his report he\r\nexpresses himself thus: 'In fulfilment of this part of my duty, I beg\r\nto state that, in my opinion, Professor Holmes has practically\r\nestablished the fitness and sufficiency of the magneto-electric light\r\nfor lighthouse purposes, so far as its nature and management are\r\nconcerned.  The light produced is powerful beyond any other that I\r\nhave yet seen so applied, and in principle may be accumulated to any\r\ndegree; its regularity in the lantern is great; its management easy,\r\nand its care there may be confided to attentive keepers of the\r\nordinary degree of intellect and knowledge.' Finally, as regards the\r\nconduct of Professor Holmes during these memorable experiments, it is\r\nonly fair to add the following remark with which Faraday closes the\r\nreport submitted to the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House on the\r\n29th of April, 1859: 'I must bear my testimony,' he says, 'to the\r\nperfect openness, candour, and honour of Professor Holmes.  He has\r\nanswered every question, concealed no weak point, explained every\r\napplied principle, given every reason for a change either in this or\r\nthat direction, during several periods of close questioning, in a\r\nmanner that was very agreeable to me, whose duty it was to search for\r\nreal faults or possible objections, in respect both of the present\r\ntime and the future.' [Footnote: Holmes's first offer of his machine\r\nto the Trinity House bears date February 2, 1857.]\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House had the\r\nintelligent courage to establish the machines of Holmes permanently at\r\nDungeness, where the magneto-electric light continued to shine for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nThe magneto-electric machine of the Alliance Company soon succeeded to\r\nthat of Holmes, being in various ways a very marked improvement on the\r\nlatter.  Its currents were stronger and its light was brighter than\r\nthose of its predecessor.  In it, moreover, the commutator, the\r\nflashing and destruction of which were sources of irregularity and\r\ndeterioration in the machine of Holmes, was, at the suggestion of M.\r\nMasson, entirely abandoned; alternating currents instead of the direct\r\ncurrent being employed. [Footnote: Du Moncel, 'l'Electricité,'\r\nAugust, 1878, p. 150.]  M. Serrin modified his excellent lamp with\r\nthe express view of enabling it to cope with alternating currents.\r\nDuring the International Exhibition of 1862, where the machine was\r\nshown, M. Berlioz offered to dispose of the invention to the Elder\r\nBrethren of the Trinity House.  They referred the matter to Faraday,\r\nand he replied as follows: 'I am not aware that the Trinity House\r\nauthorities have advanced so far as to be able to decide whether they\r\nwill require more magneto-electric machines, or whether, if they\r\nshould require them, they see reason to suppose the means of their\r\nsupply in this country, from the source already open to them, would\r\nnot be sufficient.  Therefore I do not see that at present they want\r\nto purchase a machine.'  Faraday was obviously swayed by the desire to\r\nprotect the interests of Holmes, who had borne the burden and heat\r\nwhich fall upon the pioneer.  The Alliance machines were introduced\r\nwith success at Cape la Hève, near Havre; and the Elder Brethren of\r\nthe Trinity House, determined to have the best available apparatus,\r\ndecided, in 1868, on the introduction of machines on the Alliance\r\nprinciple into the lighthouses at Souter Point and the South Foreland.\r\nThese, machines were constructed by Professor Holmes, and they still\r\ncontinue in operation.  With regard, then, to the application of\r\nelectricity to lighthouse purposes, the course of events was this: The\r\nDungeness light was introduced on January 31, 1862; the light at La\r\nHève on December 26, 1863, or nearly two years later.  But Faraday's\r\nexperimental trial at the South Foreland preceded the lighting of\r\nDungeness by more than two years.  The electric light was afterwards\r\nestablished at Cape Grisnez.  The light was started at Souter Point on\r\nJanuary 11, 1871; and at the South Foreland on January 1, 1872.\r\n\r\nAt the Lizard, which enjoys the newest and most powerful development\r\nof the electric light, it began to shine on January 1, 1878.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI have now to revert to a point of apparently small moment, but which\r\nreally constitutes an important step in the development of this\r\nsubject.  I refer to the form given in 1857 to the rotating armature\r\nby Dr. Werner Siemens, of Berlin.  Instead of employing coils wound\r\ntransversely round cores of iron, as in the machine of Saxton,\r\nSiemens, after giving a bar of iron the proper shape, wound his wire\r\nlongitudinally round it, and obtained thereby greatly augmented\r\neffects between suitably placed magnetic poles.  Such an armature is\r\nemployed in the small magneto-electric machine which I now introduce\r\nto your notice, and for which the institution is indebted to Mr. Henry\r\nWilde, of Manchester.  There are here sixteen permanent horse-shoe\r\nmagnets placed parallel to each other, and between their poles a\r\nSiemens armature.  The two ends of the wire which surrounds the\r\narmature are now disconnected.  In turning the handle and causing the\r\narmature to rotate, I simply overcome ordinary mechanical friction.\r\nBut the two ends of the armature coil can be united in a moment, and\r\nwhen this is done I immediately experience a greatly increased\r\nresistance to rotation.  Something over and above the ordinary\r\nfriction of the machine is now to be overcome, and by the expenditure\r\nof an additional amount of muscular force I am able to overcome it.\r\nThe excess of labour thus thrown upon my arm has its exact equivalent\r\nin the electric currents generated, and the heat produced by their\r\nsubsidence in the coil of the armature.  A portion of this heat may be\r\nrendered visible by connecting the two ends of the coil with a thin\r\nplatinum wire.  When the handle of the machine is rapidly turned the\r\nwire glows, first with a red heat, then with a white heat, and finally\r\nwith the heat of fusion.  The moment the wire melts, the circuit round\r\nthe armature is broken, an instant relief from the labour thrown upon\r\nthe arm being the consequence.  Clearly realise the equivalent of the\r\nheat here developed.  During the period of turning the machine a\r\ncertain amount of combustible substance was oxidised or burnt in the\r\nmuscles of my arm.  Had it done no external work, the matter consumed\r\nwould have produced a definite amount of heat.  Now, the muscular heat\r\nactually developed during the rotation of the machine fell short of\r\nthis definite amount, the missing heat being reproduced to the last\r\nfraction in the glowing platinum wire and the other parts of the\r\nmachine.  Here, then, the electric current intervenes between my\r\nmuscles and the generated heat, exactly as it did a moment ago between\r\nthe voltaic battery and its generated heat.  The electric current is\r\nto all intents and purposes a vehicle which transports the heat both\r\nof muscle and battery to any distance from the hearth where the fuel\r\nis consumed.  Not only is the current a messenger, but it is also an\r\nintensifier of magical power.  The temperature of my arm is, in round\r\nnumbers, 100° Fahr, and it is by the intensification of this heat that\r\none of the most refractory of metals, which requires a heat of 3,600°\r\nFahr.  to fuse it, has been reduced to the molten condition.\r\n\r\nZinc, as I have said, is a fuel far too expensive to permit of the\r\nelectric light produced by its combustion being used for the common\r\npurposes of life, and you will readily perceive that the human\r\nmuscles, or even the muscles of a horse, would be more expensive\r\nstill.  Here, however, we can employ the force of burning coal to turn\r\nour machine, and it is this employment of our cheapest fuel, rendered\r\npossible by Faraday's discovery, which opens out to us the prospect of\r\nbeing able to apply the electric light to public use.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 a great step in the intensification of induced currents, and\r\nthe consequent augmentation of the magneto-electric light, was taken\r\nby Mr. Henry Wilde.  It fell to my lot to report upon them to the\r\nRoyal Society, but before doing so I took the trouble of going to\r\nManchester to witness Mr. Wilde's experiments.  He operated in this\r\nway: starting from a small machine like that worked in your presence a\r\nmoment ago, he employed its current to excite an electro-magnet of a\r\npeculiar shape, between whose poles rotated a Siemens armature;\r\n[Footnote: Page and Moigno had previously shown that the\r\nmagneto-electric current could produce powerful electro-magnets.] from\r\nthis armature currents were obtained vastly stronger than those\r\ngenerated by the small magneto-electric machine.  These currents might\r\nhave been immediately employed to produce the electric light; but\r\ninstead of this they were conducted round a second electro-magnet of\r\nvast size, between whose poles rotated a Siemens armature of\r\ncorresponding dimensions.  Three armatures therefore were involved in\r\nthis series of operations: first, the armature of the small\r\nmagneto-electric machine; secondly, the armature of the first\r\nelectro-magnet, which was of considerable size; and, thirdly, the\r\narmature of the second electro-magnet, which was of vast dimensions.\r\nWith the currents drawn from this third armature, Mr. Wilde obtained\r\neffects, both as regards heat and light, enormously transcending those\r\npreviously known. [Footnote: Mr. Wilde's paper is published in the\r\n'Philosophical Transactions 'for 1867, p. 89.  My opinion regarding\r\nWilde's machine was briefly expressed in a report to the Elder\r\nBrethren of the Trinity House on May 17, 1866: 'It gives me pleasure\r\nto state that the machine is exceedingly effective, and that it far\r\ntranscends in power all other apparatus of the kind.']\r\n\r\nBut the discovery which, above all others, brought the practical\r\nquestion to the front is now to be considered.  On the 4th of\r\nFebruary, 1867, a paper was received by the Royal Society from Dr.\r\nWilliam Siemens bearing the title, 'On the Conversion of Dynamic into\r\nElectrical Force without the use of Permanent Magnetism.' [Footnote: A\r\npaper on the same subject, by Dr. Werner Siemens, was read on January\r\n17, 1867, before the Academy of Sciences in Berlin.  In a letter to\r\n'Engineering,' No. 622, p. 45, Mr. Robert Sabine states that\r\nProfessor Wheatstone's machines were constructed by Mr. Stroh in the\r\nmonths of July and August, 1866.  I do not doubt Mr. Sabine's\r\nstatement; still it would be dangerous in the highest degree to depart\r\nfrom the canon, in asserting which Faraday was specially strenuous,\r\nthat the date of a discovery is the date of its publication.  Towards\r\nthe end of December, 1866, Mr. Alfred Varley' also lodged a\r\nprovisional specification (which, I believe, is a sealed document)\r\nembodying the principles of the dynamo-electric machine, but some\r\nyears elapsed before he made anything public.  His brother, Mr.\r\nCromwell varlet', when writing on this subject in 1867, does not\r\nmention him (Proc.  Roy.  Soc, March 14, 1867).  It probably marks a\r\nnational trait, that sealed communications, though allowed in France,\r\nhave never been recognised by the scientific societies of England.] On\r\nthe 14th of February a paper from Sir Charles Wheatstone was received,\r\nbearing the title, 'On the Augmentation of the Power of a Magnet by\r\nthe reaction thereon of Currents induced by the Magnet itself.' Both\r\npapers, which dealt with the same discovery, and which were\r\nillustrated by experiments, were read upon the same night, viz. the\r\n14th of February.  It would be difficult to find in the whole field of\r\nscience a more beautiful example of the interaction of natural forces\r\nthan that set forth in these two papers.  You can hardly find a bit of\r\niron--you can hardly pick up an old horse-shoe, for example--that does\r\nnot possess a trace of permanent magnetism; and from such a small\r\nbeginning Siemens and Wheatstone have taught us to rise by a series of\r\ninteractions between magnet and armature to a magnetic intensity\r\npreviously unapproached.  Conceive the Siemens armature placed between\r\nthe poles of a suitable electro-magnet. Suppose this latter to possess\r\nat starting the faintest, trace of magnetism; when the armature\r\nrotates, currents of infinitesimal strength are generated in its coil.\r\nLet the ends of that coil be connected with the wire surrounding the\r\nelectro-magnet.  The infinitesimal current generated in the armature\r\nwill then circulate round the magnet, augmenting its intensity by an\r\ninfinitesimal amount. The strengthened magnet instantly reacts upon\r\nthe coil which feeds it, producing a current of greater strength.\r\nThis current again passes round the magnet, which immediately brings\r\nits enhanced power to bear upon the coil.  By this play of mutual give\r\nand take between magnet and armature, the strength of the former is\r\nraised in a very brief interval from almost nothing to complete\r\nmagnetic saturation.  Such a magnet and armature are able to produce\r\ncurrents of extraordinary power, and if an electric lamp be introduced\r\ninto the common circuit of magnet and armature, we can readily obtain\r\na most powerful light. [Footnote: In 1867 Mr. Ladd introduced the\r\nmodification of dividing the armature into two separate coils, one of\r\nwhich fed the electro-magnets, while the other yielded the induced\r\ncurrents.]  By this discovery, then, we are enabled to avoid the\r\ntrouble and expense involved in the employment of permanent magnets;\r\nwe are also enabled to drop the exciting magneto-electric machine, and\r\nthe duplication of the electro-magnets.  By it, in short, the electric\r\ngenerator is so far simplified, and reduced in cost, as to enable\r\nelectricity to enter the lists as the rival of our present means of\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nSoon after the announcement of their discovery by Siemens and\r\nWheatstone, Mr. Holmes, at the instance of the Elder Brethren of the\r\nTrinity House, endeavoured to turn this discovery to account for\r\nlighthouse purposes.  Already, in the spring of 1869, he had\r\nconstructed a machine which, though hampered with defects, exhibited\r\nextraordinary power.  The light was developed in the focus of a\r\ndioptric apparatus placed on the Trinity Wharf at Blackwall, and\r\nwitnessed by the Elder Brethren, Mr. Douglass, and myself, from an\r\nobservatory at Charlton, on the opposite side of the Thames.  Falling\r\nupon the suspended haze, the light illuminated the atmosphere for\r\nmiles all round.  Anything so sunlike in splendour had not, I imagine,\r\nbeen previously witnessed.  The apparatus of Holmes, however, was\r\nrapidly distanced by the safer and more powerful machines of Siemens\r\nand Gramme.\r\n\r\nAs regards lighthouse illumination, the next step forward was taken by\r\nthe Elder Brethren of the Trinity House in 1876-77.  Having previously\r\ndecided on the establishment of the electric light at the Lizard in\r\nCornwall, they instituted, at the time referred to, an elaborate\r\nseries of comparative experiments wherein the machines of Holmes, of\r\nthe Alliance Company, of Siemens, and of Gramme, were pitted against\r\neach other.  The Siemens and the Gramme machines delivered direct\r\ncurrents, while those of Holmes and the Alliance Company delivered\r\nalternating currents.  The light of the latter was of the same\r\nintensity in all azimuths; that of the former was different in\r\ndifferent azimuths, the discharge being so regulated as to yield a\r\ngush of light of special intensity in one direction.  The following\r\ntable gives in standard candles the performance of the respective\r\nmachines:\r\n\r\nName of Machines.           Maximum.

But the photometric observations, in which the external\r\nresistance was abolished, and previous to which the light-keepers had\r\nbecome more skilled in the management of the direct current, showed\r\nthe differences recorded in the table.  A close inspection of these\r\npowerful lights at the South Foreland caused my face to peel, as if it\r\nhad been irritated by an Alpine sun.]\r\n\r\nThese determinations were made with extreme care and accuracy by Mr.\r\nDouglass, the engineer-in-chief, and Mr. Ayres, the assistant engineer\r\nof the Trinity House.  It is practically impossible to compare\r\nphoto-metrically and directly the flame of the candle with these\r\nsun-like lights.  A light of intermediate intensity--that of the\r\nsix-wick Trinity oil lamp--was therefore in the first instance\r\ncompared with the electric light.  The candle power of the oil lamp\r\nbeing afterwards determined, the intensity of the electric light\r\nbecame known.  The numbers given in the table prove the superiority of\r\nthe Alliance machine over that of Holmes.  They prove the great\r\nsuperiority both of the Gramme machine and of the small Siemens\r\nmachine over the Alliance.  The large Siemens machine is shown to\r\nyield a light far exceeding all the others, while the coupling of two\r\nGrammes, or of two Siemens together, here effected for the first time,\r\nwas followed by a very great augmentation of the light, rising in the\r\none case from 6663 candles to 11,396, and in the other case from 6864\r\ncandles to 14,134.  Where the arc is single and the external\r\nresistance small, great advantages attach to the Siemens light.  After\r\nthis contest, which was conducted throughout in the most amicable\r\nmanner, Siemens machines of type No. 2 were chosen for the Lizard.\r\n[Footnote: As the result of a recent trial by Mr. Schwendler, they\r\nhave been also chosen for India.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWe have machines capable of sustaining a single light, and also\r\nmachines capable of sustaining several lights.  The Gramme machine,\r\nfor example, which ignites the Jablochkoff candles on the Thames\r\nEmbankment and at the Holborn Viaduct, delivers four currents, each\r\npassing through its own circuit.  In each circuit are five lamps\r\nthrough which the current belonging to the circuit passes in\r\nsuccession.  The lights correspond to so many resisting spaces, over\r\nwhich, as already explained, the current has to leap; the force which\r\naccomplishes the leap being that which produces the light.  Whether\r\nthe current is to be competent to pass through five lamps in\r\nsuccession, or to sustain only a single lamp, depends entirely upon\r\nthe will and skill of the maker of the machine.  He has, to guide him,\r\ndefinite laws laid down by Ohm half a century ago, by which he must\r\nabide.\r\n\r\nOhm has taught us how to arrange the elements of a Voltaic battery so\r\nas to augment indefinitely its electromotive force--that force,\r\nnamely, which urges the current forward and enables it to surmount\r\nexternal obstacles.  We have only to link the cells together so that\r\nthe current generated by each cell shall pass through all the others,\r\nand add its electro-motive force to that of all the others.  We\r\nincrease, it is true, at the same time the resistance of the battery,\r\ndiminishing thereby the quantity of the current from each cell, but we\r\naugment the power of the integrated current to overcome external\r\nhindrances.  The resistance of the battery itself may, indeed, be\r\nrendered so great, that the external resistance shall vanish in\r\ncomparison.  What is here said regarding the voltaic battery is\r\nequally true of magneto-electric machines.  If we wish our current to\r\nleap over five intervals, and produce five lights in succession, we\r\nmust invoke a sufficient electromotive force.  This is done through\r\nmultiplying, by the use of thin wires, the convolutions of the\r\nrotating armature as, a moment ago, we augmented the cells of our\r\nvoltaic battery.  Each additional convolution, like each additional\r\ncell, adds its electro-motive force to that of all the others; and\r\nthough it also adds its resistance, thereby diminishing the quantity\r\nof current contributed by each convolution, the integrated current\r\nbecomes endowed with the power of leaping across the successive spaces\r\nnecessary for the production of a series of lights in its course.  The\r\ncurrent is, as it were, rendered at once thinner and more piercing by\r\nthe simultaneous addition of internal resistance and electro-motive\r\npower.  The machines, on the other hand, which produce only a single\r\nlight have a small internal resistance associated with a small\r\nelectro-motive force.  In such machines the wire of the rotating\r\narmature is comparatively short and thick, copper riband instead of\r\nwire being commonly employed.  Such machines deliver a large quantity\r\nof electricity of low tension--in other words, of low leaping power.\r\nHence, though competent when their power is converged upon a single\r\ninterval, to produce one splendid light, their currents are unable to\r\nforce a passage when the number of intervals is increased.  Thus, by\r\naugmenting the convolutions of our machines we sacrifice quantity and\r\ngain electro-motive force; while by lessening the number of the\r\nconvolutions, we sacrifice electro-motive force and gain quantity.\r\nWhether we ought to choose the one form of machine or the other\r\ndepends entirely upon the external work the machine has to perform. If\r\nthe object be to obtain a single light of great splendour, machines of\r\nlow resistance and large quantity must be employed.  If we want to\r\nobtain in the same circuit several lights of moderate intensity,\r\nmachines of high internal resistance and of correspondingly high\r\nelectro-motive power must be invoked.\r\n\r\nWhen a coil of covered wire surrounds a bar of iron, the two ends of\r\nthe coil being connected together, every alteration of the magnetism\r\nof the bar is accompanied by the development of an induced current in\r\nthe coil.  The current is only excited during the period of magnetic\r\nchange.  No matter how strong or how weak the magnetism of the bar may\r\nbe, as long as its condition remains permanent no current is\r\ndeveloped.  Conceive, then, the pole of a magnet placed near one end\r\nof the bar to be moved along it towards the other end.  During the\r\ntime of the pole's motion there will be an incessant change in the\r\nmagnetism of the bar, and accompanying this change we shall have an\r\ninduced current in the surrounding coil.  If, instead of moving the\r\nmagnet, we move the bar and its surrounding coil past the magnetic\r\npole, a similar alteration of the magnetism of the bar will occur, and\r\na similar current will be induced in the coil.  You have here the\r\nfundamental conception which led M. Gramme to the construction of his\r\nbeautiful machine. [Footnote: 'Comptes Rendus,' 1871, p. 176.  See\r\nalso Gaugain on the Gramme machine, 'Ann. de Chem. et de Phys,'\r\nvol. xxviii. p. 324]  He aimed at giving continuous motion to such\r\na bar as we have here described; and for this purpose he bent it into\r\na continuous ring, which, by a suitable mechanism, he caused to rotate\r\nrapidly close to the poles of a horse-shoe magnet.  The direction of\r\nthe current varied with the motion and with the character of the\r\ninfluencing pole.  The result was that the currents in the two\r\nsemicircles of the coil surrounding the ring flowed in opposite\r\ndirections.  But it was easy, by the mechanical arrangement called a\r\ncommutator, to gather up the currents and cause them to flow in the\r\nsame direction.  The first machines of Gramme, therefore, furnished\r\ndirect currents, similar to those yielded by the voltaic pile.  M.\r\nGramme subsequently so modified his machine as to produce alternating\r\ncurrents.  Such alternating machines are employed to produce the\r\nlights now exhibited on the Holborn Viaduct and the Thames Embankment.\r\n\r\nAnother machine of great alleged merit is that of M. Lontin.  It\r\nresembles in shape a toothed iron wheel, the teeth being used as\r\ncores, round which are wound coils of copper wire.  The wheel is\r\ncaused to rotate between the opposite poles of powerful\r\nelectromagnets.  On passing each pole the core or tooth is strongly\r\nmagnetised, and instantly evokes in its surrounding coil an induced\r\ncurrent of corresponding strength.  The currents excited in\r\napproaching to and retreating from a pole, and in passing different\r\npoles, move in opposite directions, but by means of a commutator these\r\nconflicting electric streams are gathered up and caused to flow in a\r\ncommon bed.  The bobbins, in which the currents are induced, can be so\r\nincreased in number as to augment indefinitely the power of the\r\nmachine.  To excite his electro-magnets, M. Lontin applies the\r\nprinciple of Mr. Wilde.  A small machine furnishes a direct current,\r\nwhich is carried round the electro-magnets of a second and larger\r\nmachine.  Wilde's principle, it may be added, is also applied on the\r\nThames Embankment and the Holborn Viaduct; a small Gramme machine\r\nbeing used in each case to excite the electro-magnets of the large\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe Farmer-Wallace machine is also an apparatus of great power.  It\r\nconsists of a combination of bobbins for induced currents, and of\r\ninducing electro-magnets, the latter being excited by the method\r\ndiscovered by Siemens and Wheatstone.  In the machines intended for\r\nthe production of the electric light, the electromotive force is so\r\ngreat as to permit of the introduction of several lights in the same\r\ncircuit.  A peculiarly novel feature of the Farmer-Wallace system is\r\nthe shape of the carbons.  Instead of rods, two large plates of\r\ncarbons with bevelled edges are employed, one above the other.  The\r\nelectric discharge passes from edge to edge, and shifts its position\r\naccording as the carbon is dissipated.  The duration of the light in\r\nthis case far exceeds that obtainable with rods.  I have myself seen\r\nfour of these lights in the same circuit in Mr. Ladd's workshop in the\r\nCity, and they are now, I believe, employed at the Liverpool Street\r\nStation of the Metropolitan Railway.  The Farmer-Wallace 'quantity\r\nmachine' pours forth a flood of electricity of low tension.  It is\r\nunable to cross the interval necessary for the production of the\r\nelectric light, but it can fuse thick copper wires.  When sent through\r\na short bar of iridium, this refractory metal emits a light of\r\nextraordinary splendour. [Footnote: The iridium light was shown by Mr.\r\nLadd.  It brilliantly illuminated the theatre of the Royal\r\nInstitution.]\r\n\r\nThe machine of M. de Méritens, which he has generously brought over\r\nfrom Paris for our instruction, is the newest of all.  In its\r\nconstruction he falls back upon the principle of the magneto-electric\r\nmachine, employing permanent magnets as the exciters of the induced\r\ncurrents.  Using the magnets of the Alliance Company, by a skilful\r\ndisposition of his bobbins, M. de Méritens produces with eight magnets\r\na light equal to that produced by forty magnets in the Alliance\r\nmachines.  While the space occupied is only one-fifth, the cost is\r\nlittle more than one-fourth of the latter.  In the de Méritens machine\r\nthe commutator is abolished.  The internal heat is hardly sensible,\r\nand the absorption of power, in relation to the effects produced, is\r\nsmall.  With his larger machines M. de Méritens maintains a\r\nconsiderable number of lights in the same circuit. [Footnote: The\r\nsmall machine transforms one-and-a-quarter horse-power into heat and\r\nlight, yielding about 1,900 candles; the large machine transforms\r\nfive-horse power, yielding about 9,000 candles.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIn relation to this subject, inventors fall into two classes, the\r\ncontrivers of regulators and the constructors of machines.  M. Rapieff\r\nhas hitherto belonged to inventors of the first class, but I have\r\nreason to know that he is engaged on a machine which, when complete,\r\nwill place him in the other class also.  Instead of two single carbon\r\nrods, M. Rapieff employs two pairs of rods, each pair forming a V. The\r\nlight is produced at the common junction of the four carbons.  The\r\ndevice for regulating the light is of the simplest character.  At the\r\nbottom of the stand which supports the carbons are two small\r\nelectro-magnets.  One of them, when the current passes, draws the\r\ncarbons together, and in so doing throws itself out of circuit,\r\nleaving the control of the light to the other.  The carbons are caused\r\nto approach each other by a descending weight, which acts in\r\nconjunction with the electro-magnet.  Through the liberality of the\r\nproprietors of the Times, every facility has been given to M. Rapieff\r\nto develope and simplify his invention at Printing House Square.  The\r\nillumination of the press-room, which I had the pleasure of\r\nwitnessing, under the guidance of M. Rapieff himself, is extremely\r\neffectual and agreeable to the eye.  There are, I believe, five lamps\r\nin the same circuit, and the regulators are so devised that the\r\nextinction of any lamp does not compromise the action of the others.\r\nM. Rapieff has lately improved his regulator.\r\n\r\nMany other inventors might here be named, and fresh ones are daily\r\ncrowding in.  Mr. Werdermann has been long known in connection with\r\nthis subject.  Employing as negative carbon a disc, and as positive\r\ncarbon a rod, he has, I am assured, obtained very satisfactory\r\nresults.  The small resistances brought into play by his minute arcs\r\nenable Mr. Werdermann to introduce a number of lamps into a circuit\r\ntraversed by a current of only moderate electro-motive power.  M.\r\nReynier is also the inventor of a very beautiful little lamp, in which\r\nthe point of a thin carbon rod, properly adjusted, is caused to touch\r\nthe circumference of a carbon wheel which rotates underneath the\r\npoint.  The light is developed at the place of contact of rod and\r\nwheel.  One of the last steps, though I am informed not quite the\r\nlast, in the improvement of regulators is this: The positive carbon\r\nwastes more profusely than the negative, and this is alleged to be due\r\nto the greater heat of the former.  It occurred to Mr. William Siemens\r\nto chill the negative artificially, with the view of diminishing or\r\nwholly preventing its waste.  This he accomplishes by making the\r\nnegative pole a hollow cone of copper, and by ingeniously discharging\r\na small jet of cold water against the interior of the cone.  His\r\nnegative copper is thus caused to remain fixed in space, for it is not\r\ndissipated, the positive carbon only needing control.  I have seen\r\nthis lamp in action, and can bear witness to its success.\r\n\r\nI might go on to other inventions, achieved or projected.  Indeed,\r\nthere is something bewildering in the recent rush of constructive\r\ntalent into this domain of applied electricity.  The question and its\r\nprospects are modified from day to day, a steady advance being made\r\ntowards the improvement both of machines and regulators.  With regard\r\nto our public lighting, I strongly lean to the opinion that the\r\nelectric light will at no distant day triumph over gas.  I am not so\r\nsure that it will do so in our private houses.  As, however, I am\r\nanxious to avoid dropping a word here that could influence the share\r\nmarket in the slightest degree, I limit myself to this general\r\nstatement of opinion.\r\n\r\nTo one inventor in particular belongs the honour of the idea, and the\r\nrealisation of the idea, of causing the carbon rods to burn away like\r\na candle.  It is needless to say that I here refer to the young\r\nRussian officer, M. Jablochkoff.  He sets two carbon rods upright at a\r\nsmall distance apart, and fills the space between them with an\r\ninsulating substance like plaster of Paris.  The carbon rods are fixed\r\nin metallic holders.  A momentary contact is established between the\r\ntwo carbons by a little cross-piece of the same substance placed\r\nhorizontally from top to top.  This cross-piece is immediately\r\ndissipated or removed by the current, the passage of which once\r\nestablished is afterwards maintained.  The carbons gradually waste,\r\nwhile the substance between them melts like the wax of a candle.  The\r\ncomparison, however, only holds good for the act of melting; for, as\r\nregards the current, the insulating plaster is practically inert.\r\nIndeed, as proved by M. Rapieff and Mr. Wilde, the plaster may be\r\ndispensed with altogether, the current passing from point to point\r\nbetween the naked carbons.  M. de Méritens has recently brought out a\r\nnew candle, in which the plaster is abandoned, while between the two\r\nprincipal carbons is placed a third insulated rod of the same\r\nmaterial.  With the small de Méritens machine two of these candles can\r\nbe lighted before you; they produce a very brilliant light. [Footnote:\r\nThe machine of M. de Méritens and the Farmer-Wallace machine were\r\nworked by an excellent gas-engine, lent for the occasion by the\r\nMessrs.  Crossley, of Manchester.  The Siemens machine was worked by\r\nsteam.]  In the Jablochkoff candle it is necessary that the carbons\r\nshould be consumed at the same rate.  Hence the necessity for\r\nalternating currents by which this equal consumption is secured.  It\r\nwill be seen that M. Jablochkoff has abolished regulators altogether,\r\nintroducing the candle principle in their stead.  In my judgment, the\r\nperformance of the Jablochkoff candle on the Thames Embankment and the\r\nHolborn Viaduct is highly creditable, notwithstanding a considerable\r\nwaste of light towards the sky.  The Jablochkoff lamps, it may be\r\nadded, would be more effective in a street, where their light would be\r\nscattered abroad by the adjacent houses, than in the positions which\r\nthey now occupy in London.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIt was my custom some years ago, whenever I needed a new and\r\ncomplicated instrument, to sit down beside its proposed constructor,\r\nand to talk the matter over with him.  The study of the inventor's\r\nmind which this habit opened out was always of the highest interest to\r\nme.  I particularly well remember the impression made upon me on such\r\noccasions by the late Mr. Darker, a philosophical instrument maker in\r\nLambeth.  This man's life was a struggle, and the reason of it was not\r\nfar to seek.  No matter how commercially lucrative the work upon which\r\nhe was engaged might be, he would instantly turn aside from it to\r\nseize and realise the ideas of a scientific man.  He had an inventor's\r\npower, and an inventor's delight in its exercise. The late Mr. Becker\r\npossessed the same power in a very considerable degree.  On the\r\nContinent, Froment, Breguet, Sauerwald, and others might be mentioned\r\nas eminent instances of ability of this kind.  Such minds resemble a\r\nliquid on the point of crystallisation.  Stirred by a hint, crystals\r\nof constructive thought immediately shoot through them. That Mr.\r\nEdison possesses this intuitive power in no common measure, is proved\r\nby what he has already accomplished.  He has the penetration to seize\r\nthe relationship of facts and principles, and the art to reduce them\r\nto novel and concrete combinations.  Hence, though he has thus far\r\naccomplished nothing that we can recognise as new in relation to the\r\nelectric light, an adverse opinion as to his ability to solve the\r\ncomplicated problem on which he is engaged would be unwarranted.\r\n\r\nI will endeavour to illustrate in a simple manner Mr. Edison's alleged\r\nmode of electric illumination, taking advantage of what Ohm has taught\r\nus regarding the laws of the current, and what Joule has taught us\r\nregarding the relation of resistance to the development of light and\r\nheat.  From one end of a voltaic battery runs a wire, dividing at a\r\ncertain point into two branches, which reunite in a single wire\r\nconnected with the other end of the battery.  From the positive end of\r\nthe battery the current passes first through the single wire to the\r\npoint of junction, where it divides itself between the branches\r\naccording to a well-known law.  If the branches be equally resistant,\r\nthe current divides itself equally between them.  If one branch be\r\nless resistant than the other, more than half the current will choose\r\nthe freer path.  The strict law is that the quantity of current is\r\ninversely proportional to the resistance.  A clear image of the\r\nprocess is derived from the deportment of water.  When a river meets\r\nan island it divides, passing right and left of the obstacle, and\r\nafterwards reuniting.  If the two branch beds be equal in depth,\r\nwidth, and inclination, the water will divi de itself equally between\r\nthem.  If they be unequal, the larger quantity of water will flow\r\nthrough the more open course.  And, as in the case of the water we may\r\nhave an indefinite number of islands, producing an indefinite\r\nsubdivision of the trunk stream, so in the case of electricity we may\r\nhave, instead of two branches, any number of branches, the current\r\ndividing itself among them, in accordance with the law which fixes the\r\nrelation of flow to resistance.\r\n\r\nLet us apply this knowledge.  Suppose an insulated copper rod, which\r\nwe may call an 'electric main,' to be laid down along one of our\r\nstreets, say along the Strand.  Let this rod be connected with one end\r\nof a powerful voltaic battery, a good metallic connection being\r\nestablished between the other end of the battery and the water-pipes\r\nunder the street.  As long as the electric main continues unconnected\r\nwith the water-pipes, the circuit is incomplete and no current will\r\nflow; but if any part of the main, however distant from the battery,\r\nbe connected with the adjacent water-pipes, the circuit will be\r\ncompleted and the current will flow.  Supposing our battery to be at\r\nCharing Cross, and our rod of copper to be tapped opposite Somerset\r\nHouse, a wire can be carried from the rod into the building, and the\r\ncurrent passing through the wire may be subdivided into any number of\r\nsubordinate branches, which reunite afterwards and return through the\r\nwater-pipes to the battery.  The branch currents may be employed to\r\nraise to vivid incandescence a refractory metal like iridium or one of\r\nits alloys.  Instead of being tapped at one point, our main may be\r\ntapped at one hundred points.  The current will divide in strict\r\naccordance with law, its power to produce light being solely limited\r\nby its strength.  The process of division closely resembles the\r\ncirculation of the blood; the electric main carrying the outgoing\r\ncurrent representing a great artery, the water-pipes carrying the\r\nreturn current representing a great vein, while the intermediate\r\nbranches represent the various vessels by which the blood is\r\ndistributed through the system.  This, if I understand aright, is Mr.\r\nEdison's proposed mode of illumination.  The electric force is at\r\nhand.  Metals sufficiently refractory to bear being raised to vivid\r\nincandescence are also at hand.  The principles which regulate the\r\ndivision of the current and the development of its light and heat are\r\nperfectly well known.  There is no room for a 'discovery,' in the\r\nscientific sense of the term, but there is ample room for the exercise\r\nof that mechanical ingenuity which has given us the sewing machine and\r\nso many other useful inventions.  Knowing something of the intricacy\r\nof the practical problem, I should certainly prefer seeing it in Mr.\r\nEdison's hands to having it in mine. [Footnote: More than thirty years\r\nago the radiation from incandescent platinum was admirably\r\ninvestigated by Dr. Draper of New York.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes stated as a recommendation to the electric light, that\r\nit is light without heat; but to disprove this, it is only necessary\r\nto point to the experiments of Davy, which show that the heat of the\r\nvoltaic arc transcends that of any other terrestrial source.  The\r\nemission from the carbon points is capable of accurate analysis.  To\r\nsimplify the subject, we will take the case of a platinum wire at\r\nfirst slightly warmed by the current, and then gradually raised to a\r\nwhite heat.  When first warmed, the wire sends forth rays which have\r\nno power on the optic nerve.  They are what we call invisible rays;\r\nand not until the temperature of the wire has reached nearly 1,000°\r\nFahr, does it begin to glow with a faint, red light.  The rays which\r\nit emits prior to redness are all invisible rays, which can warm the\r\nhand but cannot excite vision.  When the temperature of the wire is\r\nraised to whiteness, these dark rays not only persist, but they are\r\nenormously augmented in intensity.  They constitute about 95 per cent.\r\nof the total radiation from the white-hot platinum wire.  They make up\r\nnearly 90 per cent.  of the emission from a brilliant electric light.\r\nYou can by no means have the light of the carbons without this\r\ninvisible emission as an accompaniment.  The visible radiation is, as\r\nit were, built upon the invisible as its necessary foundation.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to illustrate the growth in intensity of these invisible\r\nrays as the visible ones enter the radiation and augment in power. The\r\ntransparency of the elementary gases and metalloids--of oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, iodine, bromine, sulphur, phosphorus,\r\nand even of carbon, for the invisible heat rays is extraordinary.\r\nDissolved in a proper vehicle, iodine cuts the visible radiation\r\nsharply off, but allows the invisible free transmission.  By\r\ndissolving iodine in sulphur, Professor Dewar has recently added to\r\nthe number of our effectual ray-filters.  The mixture may be made as\r\nblack as pitch for the visible, while remaining transparent for the\r\ninvisible rays.  By such filters it is possible to detach the\r\ninvisible rays from the total radiation, and to watch their\r\naugmentation as the light increases.  Expressing the radiation from a\r\nplatinum wire when it first feels warm to the touch--when, therefore,\r\nall its rays are invisible--by the number 1, the invisible radiation\r\nfrom the same wire raised to a white heat may be 500 or more.\r\n[Footnote: See article 'Radiation', vol. i.]\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, by the diminution or transformation of the\r\nnon-luminous emission that we obtain the luminous; the heat rays\r\nmaintain their ground as the necessary antecedents and companions of\r\nthe light rays.  When detached and concentrated, these powerful heat\r\nrays can produce all the effects ascribed to the mirrors of Archimedes\r\nat the siege of Syracuse.  While incompetent to produce the faintest\r\nglimmer of light, or to affect the most delicate air-thermometer, they\r\nwill inflame paper, burn up wood, and even ignite combustible metals.\r\nWhen they impinge upon a metal refractory enough to bear their shock\r\nwithout fusion, they can raise it to a heat so white and luminous as\r\nto yield, when analysed, all the colours of the spectrum.  In this way\r\nthe dark rays emitted by the incandescent carbons are converted into\r\nlight rays of all colours. Still, so powerless are these invisible\r\nrays to excite vision, that the eye has been placed at a focus\r\ncompetent to raise platinum foil to bright redness, without\r\nexperiencing any visual impression.  Light for light, no doubt, the\r\namount of heat imparted by the incandescent carbons to the air is far\r\nless than that imparted by gas flames.  It is less, because of the\r\nsmaller size of the carbons, and of the comparative smallness of the\r\nquantity of fuel consumed in a given time.  It is also less because\r\nthe air cannot penetrate the carbons as it penetrates a flame.  The\r\ntemperature of the flame is lowered by the admixture of a gas which\r\nconstitutes four-fifths of our atmosphere, and which, while it\r\nappropriates and diffuses the heat, does not aid in the combustion;\r\nand this lowering of the temperature by the inert atmospheric\r\nnitrogen, renders necessary the combustion of a greater amount of gas\r\nto produce the necessary light.  In fact, though the statement may\r\nappear paradoxical, it is entirely because of its enormous actual\r\ntemperature that the electric light seems so cool. It is this\r\ntemperature that renders the proportion of luminous to non-luminous\r\nheat greater in the electric light than in our brightest flames.  The\r\nelectric light, moreover, requires no air to sustain it. It glows in\r\nthe most perfect air vacuum.  Its light and heat are therefore not\r\npurchased at the expense of the vitalising constituent of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nTwo orders of minds have been implicated in the development of this\r\nsubject; first, the investigator and discoverer, whose object is,\r\npurely scientific, and who cares little for practical ends; secondly,\r\nthe practical mechanician, whose object is mainly industrial.  It\r\nwould be easy, and probably in many cases true, to say that the one\r\nwants to gain knowledge, while the other wishes to make money; but I\r\nam persuaded that the mechanician not unfrequently merges the hope of\r\nprofit in the love of his work.  Members of each of these classes are\r\nsometimes scornful towards those of the other.  There is, for example,\r\nsomething superb in the disdain with which Cuvier hands over the\r\ndiscoveries of pure science to those who apply them: 'Your grand\r\npractical achievements are only the easy application of truths not\r\nsought with a practical intent--truths which their discoverers pursued\r\nfor their own sake, impelled solely by an ardour for knowledge.  Those\r\nwho turned them into practice could not have discovered them, while\r\nthose who discovered them had neither the time nor the inclination to\r\npursue them to a practical result.  Your rising workshops, your\r\npeopled colonies, your vessels which furrow the seas; this abundance,\r\nthis luxury, this tumult,'--this commotion,' he would have added, were\r\nhe now alive, 'regarding the electric light'--'all come from\r\ndiscoverers in Science, though all remain strange to them. The day\r\nthat a discovery enters the market they abandon it; it concerns them\r\nno more.'\r\n\r\nIn writing thus, Cuvier probably did not sufficiently take into\r\naccount the reaction of the applications of science upon science\r\nitself.  The improvement of an old instrument or the invention of a\r\nnew one is often tantamount to an enlargement and refinement of the\r\nsenses of the scientific investigator.  Beyond this, the amelioration\r\nof the community is also an object worthy of the best efforts of the\r\nhuman brain.  Still, assuredly it is well and wise for a nation to\r\nbear in mind that those practical applications which strike the public\r\neye, and excite public admiration, are the outgrowth of long\r\nantecedent labours begun, continued, and ended, under the operation of\r\na purely intellectual stimulus.  'Few,' says Pasteur, 'seem to\r\ncomprehend the real origin of the marvels of industry and the wealth\r\nof nations.  I need no other proof of this than the frequent\r\nemployment in lectures, speeches, and official language of the\r\nerroneous expression, \"applied science.\"  A statesman of the greatest\r\ntalent stated some time ago that in our day the reign of theoretic\r\nscience had rightly yielded place to that of applied science. Nothing,\r\nI venture to say, could be more dangerous, even to practical life,\r\nthan the consequences which might flow from these words.  They show\r\nthe imperious necessity of a reform in our higher education. There\r\nexists no category of sciences to which the name of \"applied science\"\r\ncould be given.  We have science and the applications of science which\r\nare united as tree and fruit.'\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nA final reflection is here suggested.  We have amongst us a small\r\ncohort of social regenerators--men of high thoughts and\r\naspirations--who would place the operations of the scientific mind\r\nunder the control of a hierarchy which should dictate to the man of\r\nscience the course that he ought to pursue.  How this hierarchy is to\r\nget its wisdom they do not explain.  They decry and denounce\r\nscientific theories; they scorn all reference to aether, and atoms,\r\nand molecules, as subjects lying far apart from the world's needs; and\r\nyet such ultra-sensible conceptions are often the spur to the greatest\r\ndiscoveries.  The source, in fact, from which the true natural\r\nphilosopher derives inspiration and unifying power is essentially\r\nideal.  Faraday lived in this ideal world.  Nearly half a century ago,\r\nwhen he first obtained a spark from the magnet, an Oxford don\r\nexpressed regret that such a discovery should have been made, as it\r\nplaced a new and facile implement in the hands of the incendiary.  To\r\nregret, a Comtist hierarchy would have probably added repression,\r\nsending Faraday back to his bookbinder's bench as a more dignified and\r\npractical sphere of action than peddling with a magnet.  And yet it is\r\nFaraday's spark which now shines upon our coasts, and promises to\r\nilluminate our streets, halls, quays, squares, warehouses, and,\r\nperhaps at no distant day, our homes.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY\r\n\r\nSPOTTISWOODE AND CO, NEW-STREET SQUARE\r\n\r\nAND PARLIAMENT STREET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Fragments of science, V. 1-2, by John Tyndall",
