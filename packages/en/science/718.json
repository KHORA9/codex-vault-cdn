You can speak of them as\r\nbeing of this sort of people or that. They are, as theatrical people\r\nsay, no more (and no less) than “character actors.” They have a class,\r\nthey have a place, they know what is becoming in them and what is due\r\nto them, and their proper size of tombstone tells at last how properly\r\nthey have played the part. But there is also another kind of life that\r\nis not so much living as a miscellaneous tasting of life. One gets hit\r\nby some unusual transverse force, one is jerked out of one’s stratum\r\nand lives crosswise for the rest of the time, and, as it were, in a\r\nsuccession of samples. That has been my lot, and that is what has set\r\nme at last writing something in the nature of a novel. I have got an\r\nunusual series of impressions that I want very urgently to tell. I have\r\nseen life at very different levels, and at all these levels I have seen\r\nit with a sort of intimacy and in good faith. I have been a native in\r\nmany social countries. I have been the unwelcome guest of a working\r\nbaker, my cousin, who has since died in the Chatham infirmary; I have\r\neaten illegal snacks—the unjustifiable gifts of footmen—in pantries,\r\nand been despised for my want of style (and subsequently married and\r\ndivorced) by the daughter of a gasworks clerk; and—to go to my other\r\nextreme—I was once—oh, glittering days!—an item in the house-party of a\r\ncountess. She was, I admit, a countess with a financial aspect, but\r\nstill, you know, a countess. I’ve seen these people at various angles.\r\nAt the dinner-table I’ve met not simply the titled but the great. On\r\none occasion—it is my brightest memory—I upset my champagne over the\r\ntrousers of the greatest statesman in the empire—Heaven forbid I should\r\nbe so invidious as to name him!—in the warmth of our mutual admiration.\r\n\r\nAnd once (though it is the most incidental thing in my life) I murdered\r\na man....\r\n\r\nYes, I’ve seen a curious variety of people and ways of living\r\naltogether. Odd people they all are great and small, very much alike at\r\nbottom and curiously different on their surfaces. I wish I had ranged\r\njust a little further both up and down, seeing I have ranged so far.\r\nRoyalty must be worth knowing and very great fun. But my contacts with\r\nprinces have been limited to quite public occasions, nor at the other\r\nend of the scale have I had what I should call an inside acquaintance\r\nwith that dusty but attractive class of people who go about on the\r\nhigh-roads drunk but _en famille_ (so redeeming the minor lapse), in\r\nthe summertime, with a perambulator, lavender to sell, sun-brown\r\nchildren, a smell, and ambiguous bundles that fire the imagination.\r\nNavvies, farm-labourers, sailormen and stokers, all such as sit in 1834\r\nbeer-houses, are beyond me also, and I suppose must remain so now for\r\never. My intercourse with the ducal rank too has been negligible; I\r\nonce went shooting with a duke, and in an outburst of what was no doubt\r\nsnobbishness, did my best to get him in the legs. But that failed.\r\n\r\nI’m sorry I haven’t done the whole lot though....\r\n\r\nYou will ask by what merit I achieved this remarkable social range,\r\nthis extensive cross-section of the British social organism. It was the\r\nAccident of Birth. It always is in England. Indeed, if I may make the\r\nremark so cosmic, everything is. But that is by the way. I was my\r\nuncle’s nephew, and my uncle was no less a person than Edward\r\nPonderevo, whose comet-like transit of the financial heavens\r\nhappened—it is now ten years ago! Do you remember the days of\r\nPonderevo, the _great_ days, I mean, of Ponderevo? Perhaps you had a\r\ntrifle in some world-shaking enterprise! Then you know him only too\r\nwell. Astraddle on Tono-Bungay, he flashed athwart the empty\r\nheavens—like a comet—rather, like a stupendous rocket!—and overawed\r\ninvestors spoke of his star. At his zenith he burst into a cloud of the\r\nmost magnificent promotions. What a time that was! The Napoleon of\r\ndomestic conveniences!\r\n\r\nI was his nephew, his peculiar and intimate nephew. I was hanging on to\r\nhis coat-tails all the way through. I made pills with him in the\r\nchemist’s shop at Wimblehurst before he began. I was, you might say,\r\nthe stick of his rocket; and after our tremendous soar, after he had\r\nplayed with millions, a golden rain in the sky, after my bird’s-eye\r\nview of the modern world, I fell again, a little scarred and blistered\r\nperhaps, two and twenty years older, with my youth gone, my manhood\r\neaten in upon, but greatly edified, into this Thames-side yard, into\r\nthese white heats and hammerings, amidst the fine realites of steel—to\r\nthink it all over in my leisure and jot down the notes and\r\ninconsecutive observations that make this book. It was more, you know,\r\nthan a figurative soar. The zenith of that career was surely our flight\r\nacross the channel in the Lord Roberts _B_....\r\n\r\nI warn you this book is going to be something of an agglomeration. I\r\nwant to trace my social trajectory (and my uncle’s) as the main line of\r\nmy story, but as this is my first novel and almost certainly my last, I\r\nwant to get in, too, all sorts of things that struck me, things that\r\namused me and impressions I got—even although they don’t minister\r\ndirectly to my narrative at all. I want to set out my own queer love\r\nexperiences too, such as they are, for they troubled and distressed and\r\nswayed me hugely, and they still seem to me to contain all sorts of\r\nirrational and debatable elements that I shall be the clearer-headed\r\nfor getting on paper. And possibly I may even flow into descriptions of\r\npeople who are really no more than people seen in transit, just because\r\nit amuses me to recall what they said and did to us, and more\r\nparticularly how they behaved in the brief but splendid glare of\r\nTono-Bungay and its still more glaring offspring. It lit some of them\r\nup, I can assure you! Indeed, I want to get in all sorts of things. My\r\nideas of a novel all through are comprehensive rather than austere....\r\n\r\nTono-Bungay still figures on the hoardings, it stands in rows in every\r\nchemist’s storeroom, it still assuages the coughs of age and brightens\r\nthe elderly eye and loosens the elderly tongue; but its social glory,\r\nits financial illumination, have faded from the world for ever. And I,\r\nsole scorched survivor from the blaze, sit writing of it here in an air\r\nthat is never still for the clang and thunder of machines, on a table\r\nlittered with working drawings, and amid fragments of models and notes\r\nabout velocities and air and water pressures and trajectories—of an\r\naltogether different sort from that of Tono-Bungay.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI write that much and look at it, and wonder whether, after all, this\r\nis any fair statement of what I am attempting in this book. I’ve given,\r\nI see, an impression that I want to make simply a hotch-potch of\r\nanecdotes and experiences with my uncle swimming in the middle as the\r\nlargest lump of victual. I’ll own that here, with the pen already\r\nstarted, I realise what a fermenting mass of things learnt and emotions\r\nexperienced and theories formed I’ve got to deal with, and how, in a\r\nsense, hopeless my book must be from the very outset. I suppose what\r\nI’m really trying to render is nothing more nor less than Life—as one\r\nman has found it. I want to tell—_myself_, and my impressions of the\r\nthing as a whole, to say things I have come to feel intensely of the\r\nlaws, traditions, usages, and ideas we call society, and how we poor\r\nindividuals get driven and lured and stranded among these windy,\r\nperplexing shoals and channels. I’ve got, I suppose, to a time of life\r\nwhen things begin to take on shapes that have an air of reality, and\r\nbecome no longer material for dreaming, but interesting in themselves.\r\nI’ve reached the criticising, novel-writing age, and here I am writing\r\nmine—my one novel—without having any of the discipline to refrain and\r\nomit that I suppose the regular novel-writer acquires.\r\n\r\nI’ve read an average share of novels and made some starts before this\r\nbeginning, and I’ve found the restraints and rules of the art (as I\r\nmade them out) impossible for me. I like to write, I am keenly\r\ninterested in writing, but it is not my technique. I’m an engineer with\r\na patent or two and a set of ideas; most of whatever artist there is in\r\nme has been given to turbine machines and boat building and the problem\r\nof flying, and do what I will I fail to see how I can be other than a\r\nlax, undisciplined story-teller. I must sprawl and flounder, comment\r\nand theorise, if I am to get the thing out I have in mind. And it isn’t\r\na constructed tale I have to tell, but unmanageable realities. My\r\nlove-story—and if only I can keep up the spirit of truth-telling all\r\nthrough as strongly as I have now, you shall have it all—falls into no\r\nsort of neat scheme of telling. It involves three separate feminine\r\npersons. It’s all mixed up with the other things....\r\n\r\nBut I’ve said enough, I hope, to excuse myself for the method or want\r\nof method in what follows, and I think I had better tell without\r\nfurther delay of my boyhood and my early impressions in the shadow of\r\nBladesover House.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere came a time when I realised that Bladesover House was not all it\r\nseemed, but when I was a little boy I took the place with the entirest\r\nfaith as a complete authentic microcosm. I believed that the Bladesover\r\nsystem was a little working-model—and not so very little either—of the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nLet me try and give you the effect of it.\r\n\r\nBladesover lies up on the Kentish Downs, eight miles perhaps from\r\nAshborough; and its old pavilion, a little wooden parody of the temple\r\nof Vesta at Tibur, upon the hill crest behind the house, commands in\r\ntheory at least a view of either sea, of the Channel southward and the\r\nThames to the northeast. The park is the second largest in Kent, finely\r\nwooded with well-placed beeches, many elms and some sweet chestnuts,\r\nabounding in little valleys and hollows of bracken, with springs and a\r\nstream and three fine ponds and multitudes of fallow deer. The house\r\nwas built in the eighteenth century, it is of pale red brick in the\r\nstyle of a French chateau, and save for one pass among the crests which\r\nopens to blue distances, to minute, remote, oast-set farm-houses and\r\ncopses and wheat fields and the occasional gleam of water, its hundred\r\nand seventeen windows look on nothing but its own wide and handsome\r\nterritories. A semi-circular screen of great beeches masks the church\r\nand village, which cluster picturesquely about the high road along the\r\nskirts of the great park. Northward, at the remotest corner of that\r\nenclosure, is a second dependent village, Ropedean, less fortunate in\r\nits greater distance and also on account of a rector. This divine was\r\nindeed rich, but he was vindictively economical because of some\r\nshrinkage of his tithes; and by reason of his use of the word Eucharist\r\nfor the Lord’s Supper he had become altogether estranged from the great\r\nladies of Bladesover. So that Ropedean was in the shadows through all\r\nthat youthful time.\r\n\r\nNow the unavoidable suggestion of that wide park and that fair large\r\nhouse, dominating church, village and the country side, was that they\r\nrepresented the thing that mattered supremely in the world, and that\r\nall other things had significance only in relation to them. They\r\nrepresented the Gentry, the Quality, by and through and for whom the\r\nrest of the world, the farming folk and the labouring folk, the\r\ntrades-people of Ashborough, and the upper servants and the lower\r\nservants and the servants of the estate, breathed and lived and were\r\npermitted. And the Quality did it so quietly and thoroughly, the great\r\nhouse mingled so solidly and effectually earth and sky, the contrast of\r\nits spacious hall and saloon and galleries, its airy housekeeper’s room\r\nand warren of offices with the meagre dignities of the vicar, and the\r\npinched and stuffy rooms of even the post-office people and the grocer,\r\nso enforced these suggestions, that it was only when I was a boy of\r\nthirteen or fourteen and some queer inherited strain of scepticism had\r\nset me doubting whether Mr. Bartlett, the vicar, did really know with\r\ncertainty all about God, that as a further and deeper step in doubting\r\nI began to question the final rightness of the gentlefolks, their\r\nprimary necessity in the scheme of things. But once that scepticism had\r\nawakened it took me fast and far. By fourteen I had achieved terrible\r\nblasphemies and sacrilege; I had resolved to marry a viscount’s\r\ndaughter, and I had blacked the left eye—I think it was the left—of her\r\nhalf-brother, in open and declared rebellion.\r\n\r\nBut of that in its place.\r\n\r\nThe great house, the church, the village, and the labourers and the\r\nservants in their stations and degrees, seemed to me, I say, to be a\r\nclosed and complete social system. About us were other villages and\r\ngreat estates, and from house to house, interlacing, correlated, the\r\nGentry, the fine Olympians, came and went. The country towns seemed\r\nmere collections of ships, marketing places for the tenantry, centres\r\nfor such education as they needed, as entirely dependent on the gentry\r\nas the village and scarcely less directly so. I thought this was the\r\norder of the whole world. I thought London was only a greater country\r\ntown where the gentle-folk kept town-houses and did their greater\r\nshopping under the magnificent shadow of the greatest of all fine\r\ngentlewomen, the Queen. It seemed to be in the divine order. That all\r\nthis fine appearance was already sapped, that there were forces at work\r\nthat might presently carry all this elaborate social system in which my\r\nmother instructed me so carefully that I might understand my “place,”\r\nto Limbo, had scarcely dawned upon me even by the time that Tono-Bungay\r\nwas fairly launched upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere are many people in England to-day upon whom it has not yet\r\ndawned. There are times when I doubt whether any but a very\r\ninconsiderable minority of English people realise how extensively this\r\nostensible order has even now passed away. The great houses stand in\r\nthe parks still, the cottages cluster respectfully on their borders,\r\ntouching their eaves with their creepers, the English countryside—you\r\ncan range through Kent from Bladesover northward and see persists\r\nobstinately in looking what it was. It is like an early day in a fine\r\nOctober. The hand of change rests on it all, unfelt, unseen; resting\r\nfor awhile, as it were half reluctantly, before it grips and ends the\r\nthing for ever. One frost and the whole face of things will be bare,\r\nlinks snap, patience end, our fine foliage of pretences lie glowing in\r\nthe mire.\r\n\r\nFor that we have still to wait a little while. The new order may have\r\ngone far towards shaping itself, but just as in that sort of lantern\r\nshow that used to be known in the village as the “Dissolving Views,”\r\nthe scene that is going remains upon the mind, traceable and evident,\r\nand the newer picture is yet enigmatical long after the lines that are\r\nto replace those former ones have grown bright and strong, so that the\r\nnew England of our children’s children is still a riddle to me. The\r\nideas of democracy, of equality, and above all of promiscuous\r\nfraternity have certainly never really entered into the English mind.\r\nBut what _is_ coming into it? All this book, I hope, will bear a little\r\non that. Our people never formulates; it keeps words for jests and\r\nironies. In the meanwhile the old shapes, the old attitudes remain,\r\nsubtly changed and changing still, sheltering strange tenants.\r\nBladesover House is now let furnished to Sir Reuben Lichtenstein, and\r\nhas been since old Lady Drew died; it was my odd experience to visit\r\nthere, in the house of which my mother had been housekeeper, when my\r\nuncle was at the climax of Tono-Bungay. It was curious to notice then\r\nthe little differences that had come to things with this substitution.\r\nTo borrow an image from my mineralogical days, these Jews were not so\r\nmuch a new British gentry as “pseudomorphous” after the gentry. They\r\nare a very clever people, the Jews, but not clever enough to suppress\r\ntheir cleverness. I wished I could have gone downstairs to savour the\r\ntone of the pantry. It would have been very different I know.\r\nHawksnest, over beyond, I noted, had its pseudomorph too; a newspaper\r\nproprietor of the type that hustles along with stolen ideas from one\r\nloud sink-or-swim enterprise to another, had bought the place outright;\r\nRedgrave was in the hands of brewers.\r\n\r\nBut the people in the villages, so far as I could detect, saw no\r\ndifference in their world. Two little girls bobbed and an old labourer\r\ntouched his hat convulsively as I walked through the village. He still\r\nthought he knew his place—and mine. I did not know him, but I would\r\nhave liked dearly to have asked him if he remembered my mother, if\r\neither my uncle or old Lichtenstein had been man enough to stand being\r\ngiven away like that.\r\n\r\nIn that English countryside of my boyhood every human being had a\r\n“place.” It belonged to you from your birth like the colour of your\r\neyes, it was inextricably your destiny. Above you were your betters,\r\nbelow you were your inferiors, and there were even an unstable\r\nquestionable few, cases so disputable that you might for the rough\r\npurposes of every day at least, regard them as your equals. Head and\r\ncentre of our system was Lady Drew, her “leddyship,” shrivelled,\r\ngarrulous, with a wonderful memory for genealogies and very, very old,\r\nand beside her and nearly as old, Miss Somerville, her cousin and\r\ncompanion. These two old souls lived like dried-up kernels in the great\r\nshell of Bladesover House, the shell that had once been gaily full of\r\nfops, of fine ladies in powder and patches and courtly gentlemen with\r\nswords; and when there was no company they spent whole days in the\r\ncorner parlour just over the housekeeper’s room, between reading and\r\nslumber and caressing their two pet dogs. When I was a boy I used\r\nalways to think of these two poor old creatures as superior beings\r\nliving, like God, somewhere through the ceiling. Occasionally they\r\nbumped about a bit and one even heard them overhead, which gave them a\r\ngreater effect of reality without mitigating their vertical\r\npredominance. Sometimes too I saw them. Of course if I came upon them\r\nin the park or in the shrubbery (where I was a trespasser) I hid or\r\nfled in pious horror, but I was upon due occasion taken into the\r\nPresence by request. I remember her “leddyship” then as a thing of\r\nblack silks and a golden chain, a quavering injunction to me to be a\r\ngood boy, a very shrunken loose-skinned face and neck, and a ropy hand\r\nthat trembled a halfcrown into mine. Miss Somerville hovered behind, a\r\npaler thing of broken lavender and white and black, with screwed up,\r\nsandy-lashed eyes. Her hair was yellow and her colour bright, and when\r\nwe sat in the housekeeper’s room of a winter’s night warming our toes\r\nand sipping elder wine, her maid would tell us the simple secrets of\r\nthat belated flush.... After my fight with young Garvell I was of\r\ncourse banished, and I never saw those poor old painted goddesses\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen there came and went on these floors over our respectful heads, the\r\nCompany; people I rarely saw, but whose tricks and manners were\r\nimitated and discussed by their maids and valets in the housekeeper’s\r\nroom and the steward’s room—so that I had them through a medium at\r\nsecond hand. I gathered that none of the company were really Lady\r\nDrew’s equals, they were greater and lesser after the manner of all\r\nthings in our world. Once I remember there was a Prince, with a real\r\nlive gentleman in attendance, and that was a little above our customary\r\nlevels and excited us all, and perhaps raised our expectations unduly.\r\nAfterwards, Rabbits, the butler, came into my mother’s room downstairs,\r\nred with indignation and with tears in his eyes. “Look at _that!_”\r\ngasped Rabbits. My mother was speechless with horror. _That_ was a\r\nsovereign, a mere sovereign, such as you might get from any commoner!\r\n\r\nAfter Company, I remember, came anxious days, for the poor old women\r\nupstairs were left tired and cross and vindictive, and in a state of\r\nphysical and emotional indigestion after their social efforts....\r\n\r\nOn the lowest fringe of these real Olympians hung the vicarage people,\r\nand next to them came those ambiguous beings who are neither quality\r\nnor subjects. The vicarage people certainly hold a place by themselves\r\nin the typical English scheme; nothing is more remarkable than the\r\nprogress the Church has made—socially—in the last two hundred years. In\r\nthe early eighteenth century the vicar was rather under than over the\r\nhouse-steward, and was deemed a fitting match for the housekeeper or\r\nany not too morally discredited discard. The eighteenth century\r\nliterature is full of his complaints that he might not remain at table\r\nto share the pie. He rose above these indignities because of the\r\nabundance of younger sons. When I meet the large assumptions of the\r\ncontemporary cleric, I am apt to think of these things. It is curious\r\nto note that to-day that down-trodden, organ-playing creature, the\r\nChurch of England village Schoolmaster, holds much the same position as\r\nthe seventeenth century parson. The doctor in Bladesover ranked below\r\nthe vicar but above the “vet,” artists and summer visitors squeezed in\r\nabove or below this point according to their appearance and\r\nexpenditure, and then in a carefully arranged scale came the tenantry,\r\nthe butler and housekeeper, the village shopkeeper, the head keeper,\r\nthe cook, the publican, the second keeper, the blacksmith (whose status\r\nwas complicated by his daughter keeping the post-office—and a fine hash\r\nshe used to make of telegrams too!) the village shopkeeper’s eldest\r\nson, the first footman, younger sons of the village shopkeeper, his\r\nfirst assistant, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAll these conceptions and applications of a universal precedence and\r\nmuch else I drank in at Bladesover, as I listened to the talk of\r\nvalets, ladies’-maids, Rabbits the butler and my mother in the\r\nmuch-cupboarded, white-painted, chintz-brightened housekeeper’s room\r\nwhere the upper servants assembled, or of footmen and Rabbits and\r\nestate men of all sorts among the green baize and Windsor chairs of the\r\npantry—where Rabbits, being above the law, sold beer without a license\r\nor any compunction—or of housemaids and still-room maids in the bleak,\r\nmatting-carpeted still-room or of the cook and her kitchen maids and\r\ncasual friends among the bright copper and hot glow of the kitchens.\r\n\r\nOf course their own ranks and places came by implication to these\r\npeople, and it was with the ranks and places of the Olympians that the\r\ntalk mainly concerned itself. There was an old peerage and a Crockford\r\ntogether with the books of recipes, the Whitaker’s Almanack, the Old\r\nMoore’s Almanack, and the eighteenth century dictionary, on the little\r\ndresser that broke the cupboards on one side of my mother’s room; there\r\nwas another peerage, with the covers off, in the pantry; there was a\r\nnew peerage in the billiard-room, and I seem to remember another in the\r\nanomalous apartment that held the upper servants’ bagatelle board and\r\nin which, after the Hall dinner, they partook of the luxury of sweets.\r\nAnd if you had asked any of those upper servants how such and such a\r\nPrince of Battenberg was related to, let us say, Mr. Cunninghame Graham\r\nor the Duke of Argyle, you would have been told upon the nail. As a\r\nboy, I heard a great deal of that sort of thing, and if to this day I\r\nam still a little vague about courtesy titles and the exact application\r\nof honorifics, it is, I can assure you, because I hardened my heart,\r\nand not from any lack of adequate opportunity of mastering these\r\nsucculent particulars.\r\n\r\nDominating all these memories is the figure of my mother—my mother who\r\ndid not love me because I grew liker my father every day—and who knew\r\nwith inflexible decision her place and the place of every one in the\r\nworld—except the place that concealed my father—and in some details\r\nmine. Subtle points were put to her. I can see and hear her saying now,\r\n“No, Miss Fison, peers of England go in before peers of the United\r\nKingdom, and he is merely a peer of the United Kingdom.” She had much\r\nexercise in placing people’s servants about her tea-table, where the\r\netiquette was very strict. I wonder sometimes if the etiquette of\r\nhousekeepers’ rooms is as strict to-day, and what my mother would have\r\nmade of a _chauffeur_....\r\n\r\nOn the whole I am glad that I saw so much as I did of Bladesover—if for\r\nno other reason than because seeing it when I did, quite naively,\r\nbelieving in it thoroughly, and then coming to analyse it, has enabled\r\nme to understand much that would be absolutely incomprehensible in the\r\nstructure of English society. Bladesover is, I am convinced, the clue\r\nto almost all that is distinctively British and perplexing to the\r\nforeign inquirer in England and the English-speaking peoples. Grasp\r\nfirmly that England was all Bladesover two hundred years ago; that it\r\nhas had Reform Acts indeed, and such—like changes of formula, but no\r\nessential revolution since then; that all that is modern and different\r\nhas come in as a thing intruded or as a gloss upon this predominant\r\nformula, either impertinently or apologetically; and you will perceive\r\nat once the reasonableness, the necessity, of that snobbishness which\r\nis the distinctive quality of English thought. Everybody who is not\r\nactually in the shadow of a Bladesover is as it were perpetually\r\nseeking after lost orientations. We have never broken with our\r\ntradition, never even symbolically hewed it to pieces, as the French\r\ndid in quivering fact in the Terror. But all the organizing ideas have\r\nslackened, the old habitual bonds have relaxed or altogether come\r\nundone. And America too, is, as it were, a detached, outlying part of\r\nthat estate which has expanded in queer ways. George Washington,\r\nEsquire, was of the gentlefolk, and he came near being a King. It was\r\nPlutarch, you know, and nothing intrinsically American that prevented\r\nGeorge Washington being a King....\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI hated teatime in the housekeeper’s room more than anything else at\r\nBladesover. And more particularly I hated it when Mrs. Mackridge and\r\nMrs. Booch and Mrs. Latude-Fernay were staying in the house. They were,\r\nall three of them, pensioned-off servants.\r\n\r\nOld friends of Lady Drew’s had rewarded them posthumously for a\r\nprolonged devotion to their minor comforts, and Mrs. Booch was also\r\ntrustee for a favourite Skye terrier. Every year Lady Drew gave them an\r\ninvitation—a reward and encouragement of virtue with especial reference\r\nto my mother and Miss Fison, the maid. They sat about in black and\r\nshiny and flouncey clothing adorned with gimp and beads, eating great\r\nquantities of cake, drinking much tea in a stately manner and\r\nreverberating remarks.\r\n\r\nI remember these women as immense. No doubt they were of negotiable\r\nsize, but I was only a very little chap and they have assumed nightmare\r\nproportions in my mind. They loomed, they bulged, they impended. Mrs.\r\nMackridge was large and dark; there was a marvel about her head,\r\ninasmuch as she was bald. She wore a dignified cap, and in front of\r\nthat upon her brow, hair was _painted_. I have never seen the like\r\nsince. She had been maid to the widow of Sir Roderick Blenderhasset\r\nImpey, some sort of governor or such-like portent in the East Indies,\r\nand from her remains—in Mrs. Mackridge—I judge Lady Impey was a very\r\nstupendous and crushing creature indeed. Lady Impey had been of the\r\nJuno type, haughty, unapproachable, given to irony and a caustic wit.\r\nMrs. Mackridge had no wit, but she had acquired the caustic voice and\r\ngestures along with the old satins and trimmings of the great lady.\r\nWhen she told you it was a fine morning, she seemed also to be telling\r\nyou you were a fool and a low fool to boot; when she was spoken to, she\r\nhad a way of acknowledging your poor tinkle of utterance with a\r\nvoluminous, scornful “Haw!” that made you want to burn her alive. She\r\nalso had a way of saying “Indade!” with a droop of the eyelids.\r\n\r\nMrs. Booch was a smaller woman, brown haired, with queer little curls\r\non either side of her face, large blue eyes and a small set of\r\nstereotyped remarks that constituted her entire mental range. Mrs.\r\nLatude-Fernay has left, oddly enough, no memory at all except her name\r\nand the effect of a green-grey silk dress, all set with gold and blue\r\nbuttons. I fancy she was a large blonde. Then there was Miss Fison, the\r\nmaid who served both Lady Drew and Miss Somerville, and at the end of\r\nthe table opposite my mother, sat Rabbits the butler. Rabbits, for a\r\nbutler, was an unassuming man, and at tea he was not as you know\r\nbutlers, but in a morning coat and a black tie with blue spots. Still,\r\nhe was large, with side whiskers, even if his clean-shaven mouth was\r\nweak and little. I sat among these people on a high, hard, early\r\nGregorian chair, trying to exist, like a feeble seedling amidst great\r\nrocks, and my mother sat with an eye upon me, resolute to suppress the\r\nslightest manifestation of vitality. It was hard on me, but perhaps it\r\nwas also hard upon these rather over-fed, ageing, pretending people,\r\nthat my youthful restlessness and rebellious unbelieving eyes should be\r\nthrust in among their dignities.\r\n\r\nTea lasted for nearly three-quarters of an hour, and I sat it out\r\nperforce; and day after day the talk was exactly the same.\r\n\r\n“Sugar, Mrs. Mackridge?” my mother used to ask.\r\n\r\n“Sugar, Mrs. Latude-Fernay?”\r\n\r\nThe word sugar would stir the mind of Mrs. Mackridge. “They say,” she\r\nwould begin, issuing her proclamation—at least half her sentences began\r\n“they say”—“sugar is fatt-an-ing, nowadays. Many of the best people do\r\nnot take it at all.”\r\n\r\n“Not with their tea, ma’am,” said Rabbits intelligently.\r\n\r\n“Not with anything,” said Mrs. Mackridge, with an air of crushing\r\nrepartee, and drank.\r\n\r\n“What won’t they say next?” said Miss Fison.\r\n\r\n“They do say such things!” said Mrs. Booch.\r\n\r\n“They say,” said Mrs. Mackridge, inflexibly, “the doctors are not\r\nrecomm-an-ding it now.”\r\n\r\nMy Mother: “No, ma’am?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Mackridge: “No, ma’am.”\r\n\r\nThen, to the table at large: “Poor Sir Roderick, before he died,\r\nconsumed great quan-ta-ties of sugar. I have sometimes fancied it may\r\nhave hastened his end.”\r\n\r\nThis ended the first skirmish. A certain gloom of manner and a pause\r\nwas considered due to the sacred memory of Sir Roderick.\r\n\r\n“George,” said my mother, “don’t kick the chair!”\r\n\r\nThen, perhaps, Mrs. Booch would produce a favourite piece from her\r\nrepertoire. “The evenings are drawing out nicely,” she would say, or if\r\nthe season was decadent, “How the evenings draw in!” It was an\r\ninvaluable remark to her; I do not know how she would have got along\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\nMy mother, who sat with her back to the window, would always consider\r\nit due to Mrs. Booch to turn about and regard the evening in the act of\r\nelongation or contraction, whichever phase it might be.\r\n\r\nA brisk discussion of how long we were to the longest or shortest day\r\nwould ensue, and die away at last exhausted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mackridge, perhaps, would reopen. She had many intelligent habits;\r\namong others she read the paper—_The Morning Post_. The other ladies\r\nwould at times tackle that sheet, but only to read the births,\r\nmarriages, and deaths on the front page. It was, of course, the old\r\n_Morning Post_ that cost threepence, not the brisk coruscating young\r\nthing of to-day. “They say,” she would open, “that Lord Tweedums is to\r\ngo to Canada.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Mr. Rabbits; “dew they?”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t he,” said my mother, “the Earl of Slumgold’s cousin?” She knew\r\nhe was; it was an entirely irrelevant and unnecessary remark, but\r\nstill, something to say.\r\n\r\n“The same, ma’am,” said Mrs. Mackridge. “They say he was extremelay\r\npopular in New South Wales. They looked up to him greatlay. I knew him,\r\nma’am, as a young man. A very nice pleasant young fella.”\r\n\r\nInterlude of respect.\r\n\r\n“’Is predecessor,” said Rabbits, who had acquired from some clerical\r\nmodel a precise emphatic articulation without acquiring at the same\r\ntime the aspirates that would have graced it, “got into trouble at\r\nSydney.”\r\n\r\n“Haw!” said Mrs. Mackridge, scornfully, “so am tawled.”\r\n\r\n“’E came to Templemorton after ’e came back, and I remember them\r\ntalking ’im over after ’e’d gone again.”\r\n\r\n“Haw?” said Mrs. Mackridge, interrogatively.\r\n\r\n“’_Is_ fuss was quotin’ poetry, ma’am. ’E said—what was it ’e\r\nsaid—‘They lef’ their country for their country’s good,’—which in some\r\nway was took to remind them of their being originally convic’s, though\r\nnow reformed. Every one I ’eard speak, agreed it was takless of ’im.”\r\n\r\n“Sir Roderick used to say,” said Mrs. Mackridge, “that the First\r\nThing,”—here Mrs. Mackridge paused and looked dreadfully at me—“and the\r\nSecond Thing”—here she fixed me again—“and the Third Thing”—now I was\r\nreleased—“needed in a colonial governor is Tact.” She became aware of\r\nmy doubts again, and added predominantly, “It has always struck me that\r\nthat was a Singularly True Remark.”\r\n\r\nI resolved that if ever I found this polypus of Tact growing up in my\r\nsoul, I would tear it out by the roots, throw it forth and stamp on it.\r\n\r\n“They’re queer people—colonials,” said Rabbits, “very queer. When I was\r\nat Templemorton I see something of ’em. Queer fellows, some of ’em.\r\nVery respectful of course, free with their money in a spasammy sort of\r\nway, but—Some of ’em, I must confess, make me nervous. They have an eye\r\non you. They watch you—as you wait. They let themselves appear to be\r\nlookin’ at you...”\r\n\r\nMy mother said nothing in that discussion. The word colonies always\r\nupset her. She was afraid, I think, that if she turned her mind in that\r\ndirection my errant father might suddenly and shockingly be discovered,\r\nno doubt conspicuously bigamic and altogether offensive and\r\nrevolutionary. She did not want to rediscover my father at all.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that when I was a little listening boy I had such an idea\r\nof our colonies that I jeered in my heart at Mrs. Mackridge’s colonial\r\nascendancy. These brave emancipated sunburnt English of the open, I\r\nthought, suffer these aristocratic invaders as a quaint anachronism,\r\nbut as for being gratified—!\r\n\r\nI don’t jeer now. I’m not so sure.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt is a little difficult to explain why I did not come to do what was\r\nthe natural thing for any one in my circumstances to do, and take my\r\nworld for granted. A certain innate scepticism, I think, explains it\r\nand a certain inaptitude for sympathetic assimilation. My father, I\r\nbelieve, was a sceptic; my mother was certainly a hard woman.\r\n\r\nI was an only child, and to this day I do not know whether my father is\r\nliving or dead. He fled my mother’s virtues before my distincter\r\nmemories began. He left no traces in his flight, and she, in her\r\nindignation, destroyed every vestige that she could of him. Never a\r\nphotograph nor a scrap of his handwriting have I seen; and it was, I\r\nknow, only the accepted code of virtue and discretion that prevented\r\nher destroying her marriage certificate and me, and so making a clean\r\nsweep of her matrimonial humiliation. I suppose I must inherit\r\nsomething of the moral stupidity that would enable her to make a\r\nholocaust of every little personal thing she had of him. There must\r\nhave been presents made by him as a lover, for example—books with\r\nkindly inscriptions, letters perhaps, a flattened flower, a ring, or\r\nsuch-like gage. She kept her wedding-ring, of course, but all the\r\nothers she destroyed. She never told me his christian name or indeed\r\nspoke a word to me of him; though at times I came near daring to ask\r\nher: add what I have of him—it isn’t much—I got from his brother, my\r\nhero, my uncle Ponderevo. She wore her ring; her marriage certificate\r\nshe kept in a sealed envelope in the very bottom of her largest trunk,\r\nand me she sustained at a private school among the Kentish hills. You\r\nmust not think I was always at Bladesover—even in my holidays. If at\r\nthe time these came round, Lady Drew was vexed by recent Company, or\r\nfor any other reason wished to take it out of my mother, then she used\r\nto ignore the customary reminder my mother gave her, and I “stayed on”\r\nat the school.\r\n\r\nBut such occasions were rare, and I suppose that between ten and\r\nfourteen I averaged fifty days a year at Bladesover.\r\n\r\nDon’t imagine I deny that was a fine thing for me. Bladesover, in\r\nabsorbing the whole countryside, had not altogether missed greatness.\r\nThe Bladesover system has at least done one good thing for England, it\r\nhas abolished the peasant habit of mind. If many of us still live and\r\nbreathe pantry and housekeeper’s room, we are quit of the dream of\r\nliving by economising parasitically on hens and pigs.... About that\r\npark there were some elements of a liberal education; there was a great\r\nspace of greensward not given over to manure and food grubbing; there\r\nwas mystery, there was matter for the imagination. It was still a park\r\nof deer. I saw something of the life of these dappled creatures, heard\r\nthe belling of stags, came upon young fawns among the bracken, found\r\nbones, skulls, and antlers in lonely places. There were corners that\r\ngave a gleam of meaning to the word forest, glimpses of unstudied\r\nnatural splendour. There was a slope of bluebells in the broken\r\nsunlight under the newly green beeches in the west wood that is now\r\nprecious sapphire in my memory; it was the first time that I knowingly\r\nmet Beauty.\r\n\r\nAnd in the house there were books. The rubbish old Lady Drew read I\r\nnever saw; stuff of the Maria Monk type, I have since gathered, had a\r\nfascination for her; but back in the past there had been a Drew of\r\nintellectual enterprise, Sir Cuthbert, the son of Sir Matthew who built\r\nthe house; and thrust away, neglected and despised, in an old room\r\nupstairs, were books and treasures of his that my mother let me rout\r\namong during a spell of wintry wet. Sitting under a dormer window on a\r\nshelf above great stores of tea and spices, I became familiar with much\r\nof Hogarth in a big portfolio, with Raphael, there was a great book of\r\nengravings from the stanzas of Raphael in the Vatican—and with most of\r\nthe capitals of Europe as they had looked about 1780, by means of\r\nseveral pig iron-moulded books of views. There was also a broad\r\neighteenth century atlas with huge wandering maps that instructed me\r\nmightily. It had splendid adornments about each map title; Holland\r\nshowed a fisherman and his boat; Russia a Cossack; Japan, remarkable\r\npeople attired in pagodas—I say it deliberately, “pagodas.” There were\r\nTerrae Incognitae in every continent then, Poland, Sarmatia, lands\r\nsince lost; and many a voyage I made with a blunted pin about that\r\nlarge, incorrect and dignified world. The books in that little old\r\ncloset had been banished, I suppose, from the saloon during the\r\nVictorian revival of good taste and emasculated orthodoxy, but my\r\nmother had no suspicion of their character. So I read and understood\r\nthe good sound rhetoric of Tom Paine’s “Rights of Man,” and his “Common\r\nSense,” excellent books, once praised by bishops and since sedulously\r\nlied about. Gulliver was there unexpurgated, strong meat for a boy\r\nperhaps but not too strong I hold—I have never regretted that I escaped\r\nniceness in these affairs. The satire of Traldragdubh made my blood\r\nboil as it was meant to do, but I hated Swift for the Houyhnhnms and\r\nnever quite liked a horse afterwards. Then I remember also a\r\ntranslation of Voltaire’s “Candide,” and “Rasselas;” and, vast book\r\nthough it was, I really believe I read, in a muzzy sort of way of\r\ncourse, from end to end, and even with some reference now and then to\r\nthe Atlas, Gibbon—in twelve volumes.\r\n\r\nThese readings whetted my taste for more, and surreptitiously I raided\r\nthe bookcases in the big saloon. I got through quite a number of books\r\nbefore my sacrilegious temerity was discovered by Ann, the old\r\nhead-housemaid. I remember that among others I tried a translation of\r\nPlato’s “Republic” then, and found extraordinarily little interest in\r\nit; I was much too young for that; but “Vathek”—“Vathek” was glorious\r\nstuff. That kicking affair! When everybody _had_ to kick!\r\n\r\nThe thought of “Vathek” always brings back with it my boyish memory of\r\nthe big saloon at Bladesover.\r\n\r\nIt was a huge long room with many windows opening upon the park, and\r\neach window—there were a dozen or more reaching from the floor up—had\r\nits elaborate silk or satin curtains, heavily fringed, a canopy (is\r\nit?) above, its completely white shutters folding into the deep\r\nthickness of the wall. At either end of that great still place was an\r\nimmense marble chimney-piece; the end by the bookcase showed the wolf\r\nand Romulus and Remus, with Homer and Virgil for supporters; the design\r\nof the other end I have forgotten. Frederick, Prince of Wales,\r\nswaggered flatly over the one, twice life-size, but mellowed by the\r\nsurface gleam of oil; and over the other was an equally colossal group\r\nof departed Drews as sylvan deities, scantily clad, against a\r\nstorm-rent sky. Down the centre of the elaborate ceiling were three\r\nchandeliers, each bearing some hundreds of dangling glass lustres, and\r\nover the interminable carpet—it impressed me as about as big as\r\nSarmatia in the store-room Atlas—were islands and archipelagoes of\r\nchintz-covered chairs and couches, tables, great Sevres vases on\r\npedestals, a bronze man and horse. Somewhere in this wilderness one\r\ncame, I remember, upon—a big harp beside a lyre-shaped music stand, and\r\na grand piano....\r\n\r\nThe book-borrowing raid was one of extraordinary dash and danger.\r\n\r\nOne came down the main service stairs—that was legal, and illegality\r\nbegan in a little landing when, very cautiously, one went through a red\r\nbaize door. A little passage led to the hall, and here one\r\nreconnoitered for Ann, the old head-housemaid—the younger housemaids\r\nwere friendly and did not count. Ann located, came a dash across the\r\nopen space at the foot of that great staircase that has never been\r\nproperly descended since powder went out of fashion, and so to the\r\nsaloon door. A beast of an oscillating Chinaman in china, as large as\r\nlife, grimaced and quivered to one’s lightest steps. That door was the\r\nperilous place; it was double with the thickness of the wall between,\r\nso that one could not listen beforehand for the whisk of the\r\nfeather-brush on the other side. Oddly rat-like, is it not, this\r\ndarting into enormous places in pursuit of the abandoned crumbs of\r\nthought?\r\n\r\nAnd I found Langhorne’s “Plutarch” too, I remember, on those shelves.\r\nIt seems queer to me now to think that I acquired pride and\r\nself-respect, the idea of a state and the germ of public spirit, in\r\nsuch a furtive fashion; queer, too, that it should rest with an old\r\nGreek, dead these eighteen hundred years to teach that.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe school I went to was the sort of school the Bladesover system\r\npermitted. The public schools that add comic into existence in the\r\nbrief glow of the Renascence had been taken possession of by the ruling\r\nclass; the lower classes were not supposed to stand in need of schools,\r\nand our middle stratum got the schools it deserved, private schools,\r\nschools any unqualified pretender was free to establish. Mine was kept\r\nby a man who had had the energy to get himself a College of Preceptors\r\ndiploma, and considering how cheap his charges were, I will readily\r\nadmit the place might have been worse. The building was a dingy\r\nyellow-brick residence outside the village, with the schoolroom as an\r\noutbuilding of lath and plaster.\r\n\r\nI do not remember that my school-days were unhappy—indeed I recall a\r\ngood lot of fine mixed fun in them—but I cannot without grave risk of\r\nmisinterpretation declare that we were at all nice and refined. We\r\nfought much, not sound formal fighting, but “scrapping” of a sincere\r\nand murderous kind, into which one might bring one’s boots—it made us\r\ntough at any rate—and several of us were the sons of London publicans,\r\nwho distinguished “scraps” where one meant to hurt from ordered\r\npugilism, practising both arts, and having, moreover, precocious\r\nlinguistic gifts. Our cricket-field was bald about the wickets, and we\r\nplayed without style and disputed with the umpire; and the teaching was\r\nchiefly in the hands of a lout of nineteen, who wore ready-made clothes\r\nand taught despicably. The head-master and proprietor taught us\r\narithmetic, algebra, and Euclid, and to the older boys even\r\ntrigonometry, himself; he had a strong mathematical bias, and I think\r\nnow that by the standard of a British public school he did rather well\r\nby us.\r\n\r\nWe had one inestimable privilege at that school, and that was spiritual\r\nneglect. We dealt with one another with the forcible simplicity of\r\nnatural boys, we “cheeked,” and “punched” and “clouted”; we thought\r\nourselves Red Indians and cowboys and such-like honourable things, and\r\nnot young English gentlemen; we never felt the strain of “Onward\r\nChristian soldiers,” nor were swayed by any premature piety in the cold\r\noak pew of our Sunday devotions. All that was good. We spent our rare\r\npennies in the uncensored reading matter of the village dame’s shop, on\r\nthe _Boys of England_, and honest penny dreadfuls—ripping stuff, stuff\r\nthat anticipated Haggard and Stevenson, badly printed and queerly\r\nillustrated, and very very good for us. On our half-holidays we were\r\nallowed the unusual freedom of rambling in twos and threes wide and far\r\nabout the land, talking experimentally, dreaming wildly. There was much\r\nin those walks! To this day the landscape of the Kentish world, with\r\nits low broad distances, its hop gardens and golden stretches of wheat,\r\nits oasts and square church towers, its background of downland and\r\nhangers, has for me a faint sense of adventure added to the pleasure of\r\nits beauty. We smoked on occasion, but nobody put us up to the proper\r\n“boyish” things to do; we never “robbed an orchard” for example, though\r\nthere were orchards all about us, we thought stealing was sinful, we\r\nstole incidental apples and turnips and strawberries from the fields\r\nindeed, but in a criminal inglorious fashion, and afterwards we were\r\nashamed. We had our days of adventure, but they were natural accidents,\r\nour own adventures. There was one hot day when several of us, walking\r\nout towards Maidstone, were incited by the devil to despise ginger\r\nbeer, and we fuddled ourselves dreadfully with ale; and a time when our\r\nyoung minds were infected to the pitch of buying pistols, by the legend\r\nof the Wild West. Young Roots from Highbury came back with a revolver\r\nand cartridges, and we went off six strong to live a free wild life one\r\nholiday afternoon. We fired our first shot deep in the old flint mine\r\nat Chiselstead, and nearly burst our ear drums; then we fired in a\r\nprimrose studded wood by Pickthorn Green, and I gave a false alarm of\r\n“keeper,” and we fled in disorder for a mile. After which Roots\r\nsuddenly shot at a pheasant in the high road by Chiselstead, and then\r\nyoung Barker told lies about the severity of the game laws and made\r\nRoots sore afraid, and we hid the pistol in a dry ditch outside the\r\nschool field. A day or so after we got in again, and ignoring a certain\r\nfouling and rusting of the barrel, tried for a rabbit at three hundred\r\nyards. Young Roots blew a molehill at twenty paces into a dust cloud,\r\nburnt his fingers, and scorched his face; and the weapon having once\r\ndisplayed this strange disposition to flame back upon the shooter, was\r\nnot subsequently fired.\r\n\r\nOne main source of excitement for us was “cheeking” people in vans and\r\ncarts upon the Goudhurst road; and getting myself into a monstrous\r\nwhite mess in the chalk pits beyond the village, and catching yellow\r\njaundice as a sequel to bathing stark naked with three other Adamites,\r\nold Ewart leading that function, in the rivulet across Hickson’s\r\nmeadows, are among my _memorabilia_. Those free imaginative afternoons!\r\nhow much they were for us! how much they did for us! All streams came\r\nfrom the then undiscovered “sources of the Nile” in those days, all\r\nthickets were Indian jungles, and our best game, I say it with pride, I\r\ninvented. I got it out of the Bladesover saloon. We found a wood where\r\n“Trespassing” was forbidden, and did the “Retreat of the Ten Thousand”\r\nthrough it from end to end, cutting our way bravely through a host of\r\nnettle beds that barred our path, and not forgetting to weep and kneel\r\nwhen at last we emerged within sight of the High Road Sea. So we have\r\nburst at times, weeping and rejoicing, upon startled wayfarers. Usually\r\nI took the part of that distinguished general Xenōphen—and please note\r\nthe quantity of the ō. I have all my classical names like\r\nthat,—Socrates rhymes with Bates for me, and except when the bleak eye\r\nof some scholar warns me of his standards of judgment, I use those dear\r\nold mispronunciations still. The little splash into Latin made during\r\nmy days as a chemist washed off nothing of the habit. Well,—if I met\r\nthose great gentlemen of the past with their accents carelessly\r\nadjusted I did at least meet them alive, as an equal, and in a living\r\ntongue. Altogether my school might easily have been worse for me, and\r\namong other good things it gave me a friend who has lasted my life out.\r\n\r\nThis was Ewart, who is now a monumental artist at Woking, after many\r\nvicissitudes. Dear chap, how he did stick out of his clothes to be\r\nsure! He was a longlimbed lout, ridiculously tall beside my more youth\r\nfull compactness, and, except that there was no black moustache under\r\nhis nose blob, he had the same round knobby face as he has to-day, the\r\nsame bright and active hazel brown eyes, the stare, the meditative\r\nmoment, the insinuating reply. Surely no boy ever played the fool as\r\nBob Ewart used to play it, no boy had a readier knack of mantling the\r\nworld with wonder. Commonness vanished before Ewart, at his expository\r\ntouch all things became memorable and rare. From him I first heard tell\r\nof love, but only after its barbs were already sticking in my heart. He\r\nwas, I know now the bastard of that great improvident artist, Rickmann\r\nEwart; he brought the light of a lax world that at least had not turned\r\nits back upon beauty, into the growing fermentation of my mind.\r\n\r\nI won his heart by a version of Vathek, and after that we were\r\ninseparable yarning friends. We merged our intellectual stock so\r\ncompletely that I wonder sometimes how much I did not become Ewart, how\r\nmuch Ewart is not vicariously and derivatively me.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAnd then when I had newly passed my fourteenth birthday, came my tragic\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nIt was in my midsummer holidays that the thing happened, and it was\r\nthrough the Honourable Beatrice Normandy. She had “come into my life,”\r\nas they say, before I was twelve.\r\n\r\nShe descended unexpectedly into a peaceful interlude that followed the\r\nannual going of those Three Great Women. She came into the old nursery\r\nupstairs, and every day she had tea with us in the housekeeper’s room.\r\nShe was eight, and she came with a nurse called Nannie; and to begin\r\nwith, I did not like her at all.\r\n\r\nNobody liked this irruption into the downstairs rooms; the two “gave\r\ntrouble,”—a dire offence; Nannie’s sense of duty to her charge led to\r\nrequests and demands that took my mother’s breath away. Eggs at unusual\r\ntimes, the reboiling of milk, the rejection of an excellent milk\r\npudding—not negotiated respectfully but dictated as of right. Nannie\r\nwas a dark, longfeatured, taciturn woman in a grey dress; she had a\r\nfurtive inflexibility of manner that finally dismayed and crushed and\r\novercame. She conveyed she was “under orders”—like a Greek tragedy. She\r\nwas that strange product of the old time, a devoted, trusted servant;\r\nshe had, as it were, banked all her pride and will with the greater,\r\nmore powerful people who employed her, in return for a life-long\r\nsecurity of servitude—the bargain was nonetheless binding for being\r\nimplicit. Finally they were to pension her, and she would die the hated\r\ntreasure of a boarding-house. She had built up in herself an enormous\r\nhabit of reference to these upstairs people, she had curbed down all\r\ndiscordant murmurings of her soul, her very instincts were perverted or\r\nsurrendered. She was sexless, her personal pride was all transferred,\r\nshe mothered another woman’s child with a hard, joyless devotion that\r\nwas at least entirely compatible with a stoical separation. She treated\r\nus all as things that counted for nothing save to fetch and carry for\r\nher charge. But the Honourable Beatrice could condescend.\r\n\r\nThe queer chances of later years come between me and a distinctly\r\nseparated memory of that childish face. When I think of Beatrice, I\r\nthink of her as I came to know her at a later time, when at last I came\r\nto know her so well that indeed now I could draw her, and show a\r\nhundred little delicate things you would miss in looking at her. But\r\neven then I remember how I noted the infinite delicacy of her childish\r\nskin and the fine eyebrow, finer than the finest feather that ever one\r\nfelt on the breast of a bird. She was one of those elfin, rather\r\nprecocious little girls, quick coloured, with dark hair, naturally\r\ncurling dusky hair that was sometimes astray over her eyes, and eyes\r\nthat were sometimes impishly dark, and sometimes a clear brown yellow.\r\nAnd from the very outset, after a most cursory attention to Rabbits,\r\nshe decided that the only really interesting thing at the tea-table was\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe elders talked in their formal dull way—telling Nannie the trite old\r\nthings about the park and the village that they told every one, and\r\nBeatrice watched me across the table with a pitiless little curiosity\r\nthat made me uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n“Nannie,” she said, pointing, and Nannie left a question of my mother’s\r\ndisregarded to attend to her; “is he a servant boy?”\r\n\r\n“S-s-sh,” said Nannie. “He’s Master Ponderevo.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a servant boy?” repeated Beatrice.\r\n\r\n“He’s a schoolboy,” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“Then may I talk to him, Nannie?”\r\n\r\nNannie surveyed me with brutal inhumanity. “You mustn’t talk too much,”\r\nshe said to her charge, and cut cake into fingers for her.\r\n\r\n“No,” she added decisively, as Beatrice made to speak.\r\n\r\nBeatrice became malignant. Her eyes explored me with unjustifiable\r\nhostility. “He’s got dirty hands,” she said, stabbing at the forbidden\r\nfruit. “And there’s a fray to his collar.”\r\n\r\nThen she gave herself up to cake with an appearance of entire\r\nforgetfulness of me that filled me with hate and a passionate desire to\r\ncompel her to admire me.... And the next day before tea, I did for the\r\nfirst time in my life, freely, without command or any compulsion, wash\r\nmy hands.\r\n\r\nSo our acquaintance began, and presently was deepened by a whim of\r\nhers. She had a cold and was kept indoors, and confronted Nannie\r\nsuddenly with the alternative of being hopelessly naughty, which in her\r\ncase involved a generous amount of screaming unsuitable for the ears of\r\nan elderly, shaky, rich aunt, or having me up to the nursery to play\r\nwith her all the afternoon. Nannie came downstairs and borrowed me in a\r\ncareworn manner; and I was handed over to the little creature as if I\r\nwas some large variety of kitten. I had never had anything to do with a\r\nlittle girl before, I thought she was more beautiful and wonderful and\r\nbright than anything else could possibly be in life, and she found me\r\nthe gentlest of slaves—though at the same time, as I made evident,\r\nfairly strong. And Nannie was amazed to find the afternoon slip\r\ncheerfully and rapidly away. She praised my manners to Lady Drew and to\r\nmy mother, who said she was glad to hear well of me, and after that I\r\nplayed with Beatrice several times. The toys she had remain in my\r\nmemory still as great splendid things, gigantic to all my previous\r\nexperience of toys, and we even went to the great doll’s house on the\r\nnursery landing to play discreetly with that, the great doll’s house\r\nthat the Prince Regent had given Sir Harry Drew’s first-born (who died\r\nat five), that was a not ineffectual model of Bladesover itself, and\r\ncontained eighty-five dolls and had cost hundreds of pounds. I played\r\nunder imperious direction with that toy of glory.\r\n\r\nI went back to school when that holiday was over, dreaming of beautiful\r\nthings, and got Ewart to talk to me of love; and I made a great story\r\nout of the doll’s house, a story that, taken over into Ewart’s hands,\r\nspeedily grew to an island doll’s city all our own.\r\n\r\nOne of the dolls, I privately decided, was like Beatrice.\r\n\r\nOne other holiday there was when I saw something of her—oddly enough my\r\nmemory of that second holiday in which she played a part is vague—and\r\nthen came a gap of a year, and then my disgrace.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nNow I sit down to write my story and tell over again things in their\r\norder, I find for the first time how inconsecutive and irrational a\r\nthing the memory can be. One recalls acts and cannot recall motives;\r\none recalls quite vividly moments that stand out inexplicably—things\r\nadrift, joining on to nothing, leading nowhere. I think I must have\r\nseen Beatrice and her half-brother quite a number of times in my last\r\nholiday at Bladesover, but I really cannot recall more than a little of\r\nthe quality of the circumstances. That great crisis of my boyhood\r\nstands out very vividly as an effect, as a sort of cardinal thing for\r\nme, but when I look for details, particularly details that led up to\r\nthe crisis—I cannot find them in any developing order at all. This\r\nhalfbrother, Archie Garvell, was a new factor in the affair. I remember\r\nhim clearly as a fair-haired, supercilious looking, weedily-lank boy,\r\nmuch taller than I, but I should imagine very little heavier, and that\r\nwe hated each other by a sort of instinct from the beginning; and yet I\r\ncannot remember my first meeting with him at all.\r\n\r\nLooking back into these past things—it is like rummaging in a neglected\r\nattic that has experienced the attentions of some whimsical robber—I\r\ncannot even account for the presence of these children at Bladesover.\r\nThey were, I know, among the innumerable cousins of Lady Drew, and\r\naccording to the theories of downstairs candidates for the ultimate\r\npossession of Bladesover. If they were, their candidature was\r\nunsuccessful. But that great place, with all its faded splendour, its\r\nfine furniture, its large traditions, was entirely at the old lady’s\r\ndisposition; and I am inclined to think it is true that she used this\r\nfact to torment and dominate a number of eligible people. Lord Osprey\r\nwas among the number of these, and she showed these hospitalities to\r\nhis motherless child and step-child, partly, no doubt, because he was\r\npoor, but quite as much, I nowadays imagine, in the dim hope of finding\r\nsome affectionate or imaginative outcome of contact with them. Nannie\r\nhad dropped out of the world this second time, and Beatrice was in the\r\ncharge of an extremely amiable and ineffectual poor army-class young\r\nwoman whose name I never knew. They were, I think, two remarkably\r\nillmanaged and enterprising children. I seem to remember too, that it\r\nwas understood that I was not a fit companion for them, and that our\r\nmeetings had to be as unostentatious as possible. It was Beatrice who\r\ninsisted upon our meeting.\r\n\r\nI am certain I knew quite a lot about love at fourteen and that I was\r\nquite as much in love with Beatrice then as any impassioned adult could\r\nbe, and that Beatrice was, in her way, in love with me. It is part of\r\nthe decent and useful pretences of our world that children of the age\r\nat which we were, think nothing, feel nothing, know nothing of love. It\r\nis wonderful what people the English are for keeping up pretences. But\r\nindeed I cannot avoid telling that Beatrice and I talked of love and\r\nkissed and embraced one another.\r\n\r\nI recall something of one talk under the overhanging bushes of the\r\nshrubbery—I on the park side of the stone wall, and the lady of my\r\nworship a little inelegantly astride thereon. Inelegantly do I say? you\r\nshould have seen the sweet imp as I remember her. Just her poise on the\r\nwall comes suddenly clear before me, and behind her the light various\r\nbranches of the bushes of the shrubbery that my feet might not profane,\r\nand far away and high behind her, dim and stately, the cornice of the\r\ngreat façade of Bladesover rose against the dappled sky. Our talk must\r\nhave been serious and business-like, for we were discussing my social\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“I don’t love Archie,” she had said, _apropos_ of nothing; and then in\r\na whisper, leaning forward with the hair about her face, “I love\r\n_you!_”\r\n\r\nBut she had been a little pressing to have it clear that I was not and\r\ncould not be a servant.\r\n\r\n“You’ll never be a servant—ever!”\r\n\r\nI swore that very readily, and it is a vow I have kept by nature.\r\n\r\n“What will you be?” said she.\r\n\r\nI ran my mind hastily over the professions.\r\n\r\n“Will you be a soldier?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“And be bawled at by duffers? No fear!” said I. “Leave that to the\r\nplough-boys.”\r\n\r\n“But an officer?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” I said, evading a shameful difficulty.\r\n\r\n“I’d rather go into the navy.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t you like to fight?”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to fight,” I said. “But a common soldier it’s no honour to\r\nhave to be told to fight and to be looked down upon while you do it,\r\nand how could I be an officer?”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t you be?” she said, and looked at me doubtfully; and the\r\nspaces of the social system opened between us.\r\n\r\nThen, as became a male of spirit, I took upon myself to brag and lie my\r\nway through this trouble. I said I was a poor man, and poor men went\r\ninto the navy; that I “knew” mathematics, which no army officer did;\r\nand I claimed Nelson for an exemplar, and spoke very highly of my\r\noutlook upon blue water. “He loved Lady Hamilton,” I said, “although\r\nshe _was_ a lady—and I will love you.”\r\n\r\nWe were somewhere near that when the egregious governess became\r\naudible, calling “Beeee-âtrice! Beeee-e-âtrice!”\r\n\r\n“Snifty beast!” said my lady, and tried to get on with the\r\nconversation; but that governess made things impossible.\r\n\r\n“Come here!” said my lady suddenly, holding out a grubby hand; and I\r\nwent very close to her, and she put her little head down upon the wall\r\nuntil her black fog of hair tickled my cheek.\r\n\r\n“You are my humble, faithful lover,” she demanded in a whisper, her\r\nwarm flushed face near touching mine, and her eyes very dark and\r\nlustrous.\r\n\r\n“I am your humble, faithful lover,” I whispered back.\r\n\r\nAnd she put her arm about my head and put out her lips and we kissed,\r\nand boy though I was, I was all atremble. So we two kissed for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n“_Beeee-e-e_-â-trice!” fearfully close.\r\n\r\nMy lady had vanished, with one wild kick of her black-stocking leg. A\r\nmoment after, I heard her sustaining the reproaches of her governess,\r\nand explaining her failure to answer with an admirable lucidity and\r\ndisingenuousness.\r\n\r\nI felt it was unnecessary for me to be seen just then, and I vanished\r\nguiltily round the corner into the West Wood, and so to love-dreams and\r\nsingle-handed play, wandering along one of those meandering bracken\r\nvalleys that varied Bladesover park. And that day and for many days\r\nthat kiss upon my lips was a seal, and by night the seed of dreams.\r\n\r\nThen I remember an expedition we made—she, I, and her half-brother—into\r\nthose West Woods—they two were supposed to be playing in the\r\nshrubbery—and how we were Indians there, and made a wigwam out of a\r\npile of beech logs, and how we stalked deer, crept near and watched\r\nrabbits feeding in a glade, and almost got a squirrel. It was play\r\nseasoned with plentiful disputing between me and young Garvell, for\r\neach firmly insisted upon the leading _rôles_, and only my wider\r\nreading—I had read ten stories to his one—gave me the ascendency over\r\nhim. Also I scored over him by knowing how to find the eagle in a\r\nbracken stem. And somehow—I don’t remember what led to it at all—I and\r\nBeatrice, two hot and ruffled creatures, crept in among the tall\r\nbracken and hid from him. The great fronds rose above us, five feet or\r\nmore, and as I had learnt how to wriggle through that undergrowth with\r\nthe minimum of betrayal by tossing greenery above, I led the way. The\r\nground under bracken is beautifully clear and faintly scented in warm\r\nweather; the stems come up black and then green; if you crawl flat, it\r\nis a tropical forest in miniature. I led the way and Beatrice crawled\r\nbehind, and then as the green of the further glade opened before us,\r\nstopped. She crawled up to me, her hot little face came close to mine;\r\nonce more she looked and breathed close to me, and suddenly she flung\r\nher arm about my neck and dragged me to earth beside her, and kissed me\r\nand kissed me again. We kissed, we embraced and kissed again, all\r\nwithout a word; we desisted, we stared and hesitated—then in a suddenly\r\ndamped mood and a little perplexed at ourselves, crawled out, to be\r\npresently run down and caught in the tamest way by Archie.\r\n\r\nThat comes back very clearly to me, and other vague memories—I know old\r\nHall and his gun, out shooting at jackdaws, came into our common\r\nexperiences, but I don’t remember how; and then at last, abruptly, our\r\nfight in the Warren stands out. The Warren, like most places in England\r\nthat have that name, was not particularly a warren, it was a long slope\r\nof thorns and beeches through which a path ran, and made an alternative\r\nroute to the downhill carriage road between Bladesover and Ropedean. I\r\ndon’t know how we three got there, but I have an uncertain fancy it was\r\nconnected with a visit paid by the governess to the Ropedean vicarage\r\npeople. But suddenly Archie and I, in discussing a game, fell into a\r\ndispute for Beatrice. I had made him the fairest offer: I was to be a\r\nSpanish nobleman, she was to be my wife, and he was to be a tribe of\r\nIndians trying to carry her off. It seems to me a fairly attractive\r\noffer to a boy to be a whole tribe of Indians with a chance of such a\r\nbooty. But Archie suddenly took offence.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said; “we can’t have that!”\r\n\r\n“Can’t have what?”\r\n\r\n“You can’t be a gentleman, because you aren’t. And you can’t play\r\nBeatrice is your wife. It’s—it’s impertinent.”\r\n\r\n“But” I said, and looked at her.\r\n\r\nSome earlier grudge in the day’s affairs must have been in Archie’s\r\nmind. “We let you play with us,” said Archie; “but we can’t have things\r\nlike that.”\r\n\r\n“What rot!” said Beatrice. “He can if he likes.”\r\n\r\nBut he carried his point. I let him carry it, and only began to grow\r\nangry three or four minutes later. Then we were still discussing play\r\nand disputing about another game. Nothing seemed right for all of us.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want you to play with us at all,” said Archie.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we do,” said Beatrice.\r\n\r\n“He drops his aitches like anything.”\r\n\r\n“No, ’e doesn’t,” said I, in the heat of the moment.\r\n\r\n“There you go!” he cried. “E, he says. E! E! E!”\r\n\r\nHe pointed a finger at me. He had struck to the heart of my shame. I\r\nmade the only possible reply by a rush at him. “Hello!” he cried, at my\r\nblackavised attack. He dropped back into an attitude that had some\r\nstyle in it, parried my blow, got back at my cheek, and laughed with\r\nsurprise and relief at his own success. Whereupon I became a thing of\r\nmurderous rage. He could box as well or better than I—he had yet to\r\nrealise I knew anything of that at all—but I had fought once or twice\r\nto a finish with bare fists. I was used to inflicting and enduring\r\nsavage hurting, and I doubt if he had ever fought. I hadn’t fought ten\r\nseconds before I felt this softness in him, realised all that quality\r\nof modern upper-class England that never goes to the quick, that hedges\r\nabout rules and those petty points of honour that are the ultimate\r\ncomminution of honour, that claims credit for things demonstrably half\r\ndone. He seemed to think that first hit of his and one or two others\r\nwere going to matter, that I ought to give in when presently my lip\r\nbled and dripped blood upon my clothes. So before we had been at it a\r\nminute he had ceased to be aggressive except in momentary spurts, and I\r\nwas knocking him about almost as I wanted to do; and demanding\r\nbreathlessly and fiercely, after our school manner, whether he had had\r\nenough, not knowing that by his high code and his soft training it was\r\nequally impossible for him to either buck-up and beat me, or give in.\r\n\r\nI have a very distinct impression of Beatrice dancing about us during\r\nthe affair in a state of unladylike appreciation, but I was too\r\npreoccupied to hear much of what she was saying. But she certainly\r\nbacked us both, and I am inclined to think now—it may be the\r\ndisillusionment of my ripened years—whichever she thought was winning.\r\n\r\nThen young Garvell, giving way before my slogging, stumbled and fell\r\nover a big flint, and I, still following the tradition of my class and\r\nschool, promptly flung myself on him to finish him. We were busy with\r\neach other on the ground when we became aware of a dreadful\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n“Shut up, you _fool!_” said Archie.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lady Drew!” I heard Beatrice cry. “They’re fighting! They’re\r\nfighting something awful!”\r\n\r\nI looked over my shoulder. Archie’s wish to get up became irresistible,\r\nand my resolve to go on with him vanished altogether.\r\n\r\nI became aware of the two old ladies, presences of black and purple\r\nsilk and fur and shining dark things; they had walked up through the\r\nWarren, while the horses took the hill easily, and so had come upon us.\r\nBeatrice had gone to them at once with an air of taking refuge, and\r\nstood beside and a little behind them. We both rose dejectedly. The two\r\nold ladies were evidently quite dreadfully shocked, and peering at us\r\nwith their poor old eyes; and never had I seen such a tremblement in\r\nLady Drew’s lorgnettes.\r\n\r\n“You’ve never been fighting?” said Lady Drew.\r\n\r\n“You have been fighting.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t proper fighting,” snapped Archie, with accusing eyes on me.\r\n\r\n“It’s Mrs. Ponderevo’s George!” said Miss Somerville, so adding a\r\nconviction for ingratitude to my evident sacrilege.\r\n\r\n“How could he _dare?_” cried Lady Drew, becoming very awful.\r\n\r\n“He broke the rules” said Archie, sobbing for breath. “I slipped,\r\nand—he hit me while I was down. He knelt on me.”\r\n\r\n“How could you _dare?_” said Lady Drew.\r\n\r\nI produced an experienced handkerchief rolled up into a tight ball, and\r\nwiped the blood from my chin, but I offered no explanation of my\r\ndaring. Among other things that prevented that, I was too short of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n“He didn’t fight fair,” sobbed Archie.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, from behind the old ladies, regarded me intently and without\r\nhostility. I am inclined to think the modification of my face through\r\nthe damage to my lip interested her. It became dimly apparent to my\r\nconfused intelligence that I must not say these two had been playing\r\nwith me. That would not be after the rules of their game. I resolved in\r\nthis difficult situation upon a sulky silence, and to take whatever\r\nconsequences might follow.\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe powers of justice in Bladesover made an extraordinary mess of my\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI have regretfully to admit that the Honourable Beatrice Normandy did,\r\nat the age of ten, betray me, abandon me, and lie most abominably about\r\nme. She was, as a matter of fact, panic-stricken about me, conscience\r\nstricken too; she bolted from the very thought of my being her\r\naffianced lover and so forth, from the faintest memory of kissing; she\r\nwas indeed altogether disgraceful and human in her betrayal. She and\r\nher half-brother lied in perfect concord, and I was presented as a\r\nwanton assailant of my social betters. They were waiting about in the\r\nWarren, when I came up and spoke to them, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I now perceive Lady Drew’s decisions were, in the light\r\nof the evidence, reasonable and merciful.\r\n\r\nThey were conveyed to me by my mother, who was, I really believe, even\r\nmore shocked by the grossness of my social insubordination than Lady\r\nDrew. She dilated on her ladyship’s kindnesses to me, on the effrontery\r\nand wickedness of my procedure, and so came at last to the terms of my\r\npenance. “You must go up to young Mr. Garvell, and beg his pardon.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t beg his pardon,” I said, speaking for the first time.\r\n\r\nMy mother paused, incredulous.\r\n\r\nI folded my arms on her table-cloth, and delivered my wicked little\r\nultimatum. “I won’t beg his pardon nohow,” I said. “See?”\r\n\r\n“Then you will have to go off to your uncle Frapp at Chatham.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care where I have to go or what I have to do, I won’t beg his\r\npardon,” I said.\r\n\r\nAnd I didn’t.\r\n\r\nAfter that I was one against the world. Perhaps in my mother’s heart\r\nthere lurked some pity for me, but she did not show it. She took the\r\nside of the young gentleman; she tried hard, she tried very hard, to\r\nmake me say I was sorry I had struck him. Sorry!\r\n\r\nI couldn’t explain.\r\n\r\nSo I went into exile in the dog-cart to Redwood station, with Jukes the\r\ncoachman, coldly silent, driving me, and all my personal belongings in\r\na small American cloth portmanteau behind.\r\n\r\nI felt I had much to embitter me; the game had and the beginnings of\r\nfairness by any standards I knew.... But the thing that embittered me\r\nmost was that the Honourable Beatrice Normandy should have repudiated\r\nand fled from me as though I was some sort of leper, and not even have\r\ntaken a chance or so, to give me a good-bye. She might have done that\r\nanyhow! Supposing I had told on her! But the son of a servant counts as\r\na servant. She had forgotten and now remembered.\r\n\r\nI solaced myself with some extraordinary dream of coming back to\r\nBladesover, stern, powerful, after the fashion of Coriolanus. I do not\r\nrecall the details, but I have no doubt I displayed great\r\nmagnanimity...\r\n\r\nWell, anyhow I never said I was sorry for pounding young Garvell, and I\r\nam not sorry to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\r\nOF MY LAUNCH INTO THE WORLD AND THE LAST I SAW OF BLADESOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen I was thus banished from Bladesover House, as it was then thought\r\nfor good and all, I was sent by my mother in a vindictive spirit, first\r\nto her cousin Nicodemus Frapp, and then, as a fully indentured\r\napprentice, to my uncle Ponderevo.\r\n\r\nI ran away from the care of my cousin Nicodemus back to Bladesover\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMy cousin Nicodemus Frapp was a baker in a back street—a slum\r\nrather—just off that miserable narrow mean high road that threads those\r\nexquisite beads, Rochester and Chatham. He was, I must admit, a shock\r\nto me, much dominated by a young, plump, prolific, malingering wife; a\r\nbent, slow-moving, unwilling dark man with flour in his hair and\r\neyelashes, in the lines of his face and the seams of his coat. I’ve\r\nnever had a chance to correct my early impression of him, and he still\r\nremains an almost dreadful memory, a sort of caricature of incompetent\r\nsimplicity. As I remember him, indeed, he presented the servile\r\ntradition perfected. He had no pride in his person; fine clothes and\r\ndressing up wasn’t “for the likes of” him, so that he got his wife, who\r\nwas no artist at it, to cut his black hair at irregular intervals, and\r\nlet his nails become disagreeable to the fastidious eye; he had no\r\npride in his business nor any initiative; his only virtues were not\r\ndoing certain things and hard work. “Your uncle,” said my mother—all\r\ngrown-up cousins were uncles by courtesy among the Victorian\r\nmiddle-class—“isn’t much to look at or talk to, but he’s a Good\r\nHard-Working Man.” There was a sort of base honourableness about toil,\r\nhowever needless, in that system of inversion. Another point of honour\r\nwas to rise at or before dawn, and then laboriously muddle about.\r\n\r\nIt was very distinctly impressed on my mind that the Good Hard-Working\r\nMan would have thought it “fal-lallish” to own a pocket handkerchief.\r\nPoor old Frapp—dirty and crushed by, product of, Bladesover’s\r\nmagnificence! He made no fight against the world at all, he was\r\nfloundering in small debts that were not so small but that finally they\r\noverwhelmed him, whenever there was occasion for any exertion his wife\r\nfell back upon pains and her “condition,” and God sent them many\r\nchildren, most of whom died, and so, by their coming and going, gave a\r\ndouble exercise in the virtues of submission.\r\n\r\nResignation to God’s will was the common device of these people in the\r\nface of every duty and every emergency. There were no books in the\r\nhouse; I doubt if either of them had retained the capacity for reading\r\nconsecutively for more than a minute or so, and it was with amazement\r\nthat day after day, over and above stale bread, one beheld food and\r\nagain more food amidst the litter that held permanent session on the\r\nliving-room table.\r\n\r\nOne might have doubted if either of them felt discomfort in this dusty\r\ndarkness of existence, if it was not that they did visibly seek\r\nconsolation. They sought this and found it of a Sunday, not in strong\r\ndrink and raving, but in imaginary draughts of blood. They met with\r\ntwenty or thirty other darkened and unclean people, all dressed in\r\ndingy colours that would not show the dirt, in a little brick-built\r\nchapel equipped with a spavined roarer of a harmonium, and there\r\nsolaced their minds on the thought that all that was fair and free in\r\nlife, all that struggled, all that planned and made, all pride and\r\nbeauty and honour, all fine and enjoyable things, were irrevocably\r\ndamned to everlasting torments. They were the self-appointed confidants\r\nof God’s mockery of his own creation. So at any rate they stick in my\r\nmind. Vaguer, and yet hardly less agreeable than this cosmic jest, this\r\ncoming “Yah, clever!” and general serving out and “showing up” of the\r\nlucky, the bold, and the cheerful, was their own predestination to\r\nGlory.\r\n\r\n“There is a Fountain, filled with Blood\r\nDrawn from Emmanuel’s Veins,”\r\n\r\n\r\nso they sang. I hear the drone and wheeze of that hymn now. I hated\r\nthem with the bitter uncharitable condemnation of boyhood, and a twinge\r\nof that hate comes back to me. As I write the words, the sounds and\r\nthen the scene return, these obscure, undignified people, a fat woman\r\nwith asthma, an old Welsh milk-seller with a tumour on his bald head,\r\nwho was the intellectual leader of the sect, a huge-voiced haberdasher\r\nwith a big black beard, a white-faced, extraordinarily pregnant woman,\r\nhis wife, a spectacled rate collector with a bent back.... I hear the\r\ntalk about souls, the strange battered old phrases that were coined\r\nages ago in the seaports of the sun-dry Levant, of balm of Gilead and\r\nmanna in the desert, of gourds that give shade and water in a thirsty\r\nland; I recall again the way in which at the conclusion of the service\r\nthe talk remained pious in form but became medical in substance, and\r\nhow the women got together for obstetric whisperings. I, as a boy, did\r\nnot matter, and might overhear.\r\n\r\nIf Bladesover is my key for the explanation of England, I think my\r\ninvincible persuasion that I understand Russia was engendered by the\r\ncircle of Uncle Frapp.\r\n\r\nI slept in a dingy sheeted bed with the two elder survivors of Frapp\r\nfecundity, and spent my week days in helping in the laborious disorder\r\nof the shop and bakehouse, in incidental deliveries of bread and so\r\nforth, and in parrying the probings of my uncle into my relations with\r\nthe Blood, and his confidential explanations that ten shillings a\r\nweek—which was what my mother paid him—was not enough to cover my\r\naccommodation. He was very anxious to keep that, but also he wanted\r\nmore. There were neither books nor any seat nor corner in that house\r\nwhere reading was possible, no newspaper ever brought the clash of\r\nworldly things into its heavenward seclusion; horror of it all grew in\r\nme daily, and whenever I could I escaped into the streets and tramped\r\nabout Chatham. The news shops appealed to me particularly. One saw\r\nthere smudgy illustrated sheets, the _Police News_ in particular, in\r\nwhich vilely drawn pictures brought home to the dullest intelligence an\r\ninterminable succession of squalid crimes, women murdered and put into\r\nboxes, buried under floors, old men bludgeoned at midnight by robbers,\r\npeople thrust suddenly out of trains, happy lovers shot, vitrioled and\r\nso forth by rivals. I got my first glimpse of the life of pleasure in\r\nfoully drawn pictures of “police raids” on this and that. Interspersed\r\nwith these sheets were others in which Sloper, the urban John Bull, had\r\nhis fling with gin bottle and obese umbrella, or the kindly empty faces\r\nof the Royal Family appeared and reappeared, visiting this, opening\r\nthat, getting married, getting offspring, lying in state, doing\r\neverything but anything, a wonderful, good-meaning, impenetrable race\r\napart.\r\n\r\nI have never revisited Chatham; the impression it has left on my mind\r\nis one of squalid compression, unlit by any gleam of a maturer charity.\r\nAll its effects arranged themselves as antithetical to the Bladesover\r\neffects. They confirmed and intensified all that Bladesover suggested.\r\nBladesover declared itself to be the land, to be essentially England; I\r\nhave already told how its airy spaciousness, its wide dignity, seemed\r\nto thrust village, church, and vicarage into corners, into a secondary\r\nand conditional significance. Here one gathered the corollary of that.\r\nSince the whole wide country of Kent was made up of contiguous\r\nBladesovers and for the gentlefolk, the surplus of population, all who\r\nwere not good tenants nor good labourers, Church of England, submissive\r\nand respectful, were necessarily thrust together, jostled out of sight,\r\nto fester as they might in this place that had the colours and even the\r\nsmells of a well-packed dustbin. They should be grateful even for that;\r\nthat, one felt, was the theory of it all.\r\n\r\nAnd I loafed about this wilderness of crowded dinginess, with young,\r\nreceptive, wide-open eyes, and through the blessing (or curse) of some\r\nfairy godmother of mine, asking and asking again: “But after all,\r\n_why_—”\r\n\r\nI wandered up through Rochester once, and had a glimpse of the Stour\r\nvalley above the town, all horrible with cement works and foully\r\nsmoking chimneys and rows of workmen’s cottages, minute, ugly,\r\nuncomfortable, and grimy. So I had my first intimation of how\r\nindustrialism must live in a landlord’s land. I spent some hours, too,\r\nin the streets that give upon the river, drawn by the spell of the sea.\r\nBut I saw barges and ships stripped of magic and mostly devoted to\r\ncement, ice, timber, and coal. The sailors looked to me gross and\r\nslovenly men, and the shipping struck me as clumsy, ugly, old, and\r\ndirty. I discovered that most sails don’t fit the ships that hoist\r\nthem, and that there may be as pitiful and squalid a display of poverty\r\nwith a vessel as with a man. When I saw colliers unloading, watched the\r\nworkers in the hold filling up silly little sacks and the succession of\r\nblackened, half-naked men that ran to and fro with these along a plank\r\nover a thirty-foot drop into filth and mud, I was first seized with\r\nadmiration of their courage and toughness and then, “But after all,\r\n_why_—?” and the stupid ugliness of all this waste of muscle and\r\nendurance came home to me. Among other things it obviously wasted and\r\ndeteriorated the coal.... And I had imagined great things of the sea!\r\n\r\nWell, anyhow, for a time that vocation was stilled.\r\n\r\nBut such impressions came into my leisure, and of that I had no excess.\r\nMost of my time was spent doing things for Uncle Frapp, and my evenings\r\nand nights perforce in the company of the two eldest of my cousins. He\r\nwas errand boy at an oil shop and fervently pious, and of him I saw\r\nnothing until the evening except at meals; the other was enjoying the\r\nmidsummer holidays without any great elation; a singularly thin and\r\nabject, stunted creature he was, whose chief liveliness was to pretend\r\nto be a monkey, and who I am now convinced had some secret disease that\r\ndrained his vitality away. If I met him now I should think him a\r\npitiful little creature and be extremely sorry for him. Then I felt\r\nonly a wondering aversion. He sniffed horribly, he was tired out by a\r\ncouple of miles of loafing, he never started any conversation, and he\r\nseemed to prefer his own company to mine. His mother, poor woman, said\r\nhe was the “thoughtful one.”\r\n\r\nSerious trouble came suddenly out of a conversation we held in bed one\r\nnight. Some particularly pious phrase of my elder cousin’s irritated me\r\nextremely, and I avowed outright my entire disbelief in the whole\r\nscheme of revealed religion. I had never said a word about my doubts to\r\nany one before, except to Ewart who had first evolved them. I had never\r\nsettled my doubts until at this moment when I spoke. But it came to me\r\nthen that the whole scheme of salvation of the Frappes was not simply\r\ndoubtful, but impossible. I fired this discovery out into the darkness\r\nwith the greatest promptitude.\r\n\r\nMy abrupt denials certainly scared my cousin amazingly.\r\n\r\nAt first they could not understand what I was saying, and when they did\r\nI fully believe they expected an instant answer in thunderbolts and\r\nflames. They gave me more room in the bed forthwith, and then the elder\r\nsat up and expressed his sense of my awfulness. I was already a little\r\nfrightened at my temerity, but when he asked me categorically to unsay\r\nwhat I had said, what could I do but confirm my repudiation?\r\n\r\n“There’s no hell,” I said, “and no eternal punishment. No God would be\r\nsuch a fool as that.”\r\n\r\nMy elder cousin cried aloud in horror, and the younger lay scared, but\r\nlistening. “Then you mean,” said my elder cousin, when at last he could\r\nbring himself to argue, “you might do just as you liked?”\r\n\r\n“If you were cad enough,” said I.\r\n\r\nOur little voices went on interminably, and at one stage my cousin got\r\nout of bed and made his brother do likewise, and knelt in the night\r\ndimness and prayed at me. That I found trying, but I held out\r\nvaliantly. “Forgive him,” said my cousin, “he knows not what he\r\nsayeth.”\r\n\r\n“You can pray if you like,” I said, “but if you’re going to cheek me in\r\nyour prayers I draw the line.”\r\n\r\nThe last I remember of that great discussion was my cousin deploring\r\nthe fact that he “should ever sleep in the same bed with an Infidel!”\r\n\r\nThe next day he astonished me by telling the whole business to his\r\nfather. This was quite outside all my codes. Uncle Nicodemus sprang it\r\nupon me at the midday meal.\r\n\r\n“You been sayin’ queer things, George,” he said abruptly. “You better\r\nmind what you’re saying.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say, father?” said Mrs. Frapp.\r\n\r\n“Things I couldn’t’ repeat,” said he.\r\n\r\n“What things?” I asked hotly.\r\n\r\n“Ask ’_im_,” said my uncle, pointing with his knife to his informant,\r\nand making me realise the nature of my offence. My aunt looked at the\r\nwitness. “Not—?” she framed a question.\r\n\r\n“Wuss,” said my uncle. “Blarsphemy.”\r\n\r\nMy aunt couldn’t touch another mouthful. I was already a little\r\ntroubled in my conscience by my daring, and now I began to feel the\r\nblack enormity of the course upon which I had embarked.\r\n\r\n“I was only talking sense,” I said.\r\n\r\nI had a still more dreadful moment when presently I met my cousin in\r\nthe brick alley behind the yard, that led back to his grocer’s shop.\r\n\r\n“You sneak!” I said, and smacked his face hard forthwith. “Now then,”\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\nHe started back, astonished and alarmed. His eyes met mine, and I saw a\r\nsudden gleam of resolution. He turned his other cheek to me.\r\n\r\n“’It it,” he said. “’It it. _I’ll_ forgive you.”\r\n\r\nI felt I had never encountered a more detestable way of evading a\r\nlicking. I shoved him against the wall and left him there, forgiving\r\nme, and went back into the house.\r\n\r\n“You better not speak to your cousins, George,” said my aunt, “till\r\nyou’re in a better state of mind.”\r\n\r\nI became an outcast forthwith. At supper that night a gloomy silence\r\nwas broken by my cousin saying,\r\n\r\n“’E ’it me for telling you, and I turned the other cheek, muvver.”\r\n\r\n“’E’s got the evil one be’ind ’im now, a ridin’ on ’is back,” said my\r\naunt, to the grave discomfort of the eldest girl, who sat beside me.\r\n\r\nAfter supper my uncle, in a few ill-chosen words, prayed me to repent\r\nbefore I slept.\r\n\r\n“Suppose you was took in your sleep, George,” he said; “where’d you be\r\nthen? You jest think of that me boy.” By this time I was thoroughly\r\nmiserable and frightened, and this suggestion unnerved me dreadfully\r\nbut I kept up an impenitent front. “To wake in ’ell,” said Uncle\r\nNicodemus, in gentle tones. “You don’t want to wake in ’ell, George,\r\nburnin’ and screamin’ for ever, do you? You wouldn’t like that?”\r\n\r\nHe tried very hard to get me to “jest ’ave a look at the bake’ouse\r\nfire” before I retired. “It might move you,” he said.\r\n\r\nI was awake longest that night. My cousins slept, the sleep of faith on\r\neither side of me. I decided I would whisper my prayers, and stopped\r\nmidway because I was ashamed, and perhaps also because I had an idea\r\none didn’t square God like that.\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, with a sudden confidence, “damn me if you’re coward\r\nenough.... But you’re not. No! You couldn’t be!”\r\n\r\nI woke my cousins up with emphatic digs, and told them as much,\r\ntriumphantly, and went very peacefully to sleep with my act of faith\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nI slept not only through that night, but for all my nights since then.\r\nSo far as any fear of Divine injustice goes, I sleep soundly, and\r\nshall, I know, to the end of things. That declaration was an epoch in\r\nmy spiritual life.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBut I didn’t expect to have the whole meeting on Sunday turned on to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIt was. It all comes back to me, that convergence of attention, even\r\nthe faint leathery smell of its atmosphere returns, and the coarse feel\r\nof my aunt’s black dress beside me in contact with my hand. I see again\r\nthe old Welsh milkman “wrestling” with me, they all wrestled with me,\r\nby prayer or exhortation. And I was holding out stoutly, though\r\nconvinced now by the contagion of their universal conviction that by\r\ndoing so I was certainly and hopelessly damned. I felt that they were\r\nright, that God was probably like them, and that on the whole it didn’t\r\nmatter. And to simplify the business thoroughly I had declared I didn’t\r\nbelieve anything at all. They confuted me by texts from Scripture which\r\nI now perceive was an illegitimate method of reply. When I got home,\r\nstill impenitent and eternally lost and secretly very lonely and\r\nmiserable and alarmed, Uncle Nicodemus docked my Sunday pudding.\r\n\r\nOne person only spoke to me like a human being on that day of wrath,\r\nand that was the younger Frapp. He came up to me in the afternoon while\r\nI was confined upstairs with a Bible and my own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“’Ello,” he said, and fretted about.\r\n\r\n“D’you mean to say there isn’t—no one,” he said, funking the word.\r\n\r\n“No one?”\r\n\r\n“No one watching yer—always.”\r\n\r\n“Why should there be?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“You can’t ’elp thoughts,” said my cousin, “anyhow. You mean—” He\r\nstopped hovering. “I s’pose I oughtn’t to be talking to you.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and flitted away with a guilty back glance over his\r\nshoulder....\r\n\r\nThe following week made life quite intolerable for me; these people\r\nforced me at last into an Atheism that terrified me. When I learnt that\r\nnext Sunday the wrestling was to be resumed, my courage failed me\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nI happened upon a map of Kent in a stationer’s window on Saturday, and\r\nthat set me thinking of one form of release. I studied it intently for\r\nhalf an hour perhaps, on Saturday night, got a route list of villages\r\nwell fixed in my memory, and got up and started for Bladesover about\r\nfive on Sunday morning while my two bed mates were still fast asleep.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nI remember something, but not so much of it as I should like to recall,\r\nof my long tramp to Bladesover House. The distance from Chatham is\r\nalmost exactly seventeen miles, and it took me until nearly one. It was\r\nvery interesting and I do not think I was very fatigued, though I got\r\nrather pinched by one boot.\r\n\r\nThe morning must have been very clear, because I remember that near\r\nItchinstow Hall I looked back and saw the estuary of the Thames, that\r\nriver that has since played so large a part in my life. But at the time\r\nI did not know it was the Thames, I thought this great expanse of mud\r\nflats and water was the sea, which I had never yet seen nearly. And out\r\nupon it stood ships, sailing ships and a steamer or so, going up to\r\nLondon or down out into the great seas of the world. I stood for a long\r\ntime watching these and thinking whether after all I should not have\r\ndone better to have run away to sea.\r\n\r\nThe nearer I drew to Bladesover, the more doubtful I grew of the\r\nduality of my reception, and the more I regretted that alternative. I\r\nsuppose it was the dirty clumsiness of the shipping I had seen nearly,\r\nthat put me out of mind of that. I took a short cut through the Warren\r\nacross the corner of the main park to intercept the people from the\r\nchurch. I wanted to avoid meeting any one before I met my mother, and\r\nso I went to a place where the path passed between banks, and without\r\nexactly hiding, stood up among the bushes. This place among other\r\nadvantages eliminated any chance of seeing Lady Drew, who would drive\r\nround by the carriage road.\r\n\r\nStanding up to waylay in this fashion I had a queer feeling of\r\nbrigandage, as though I was some intrusive sort of bandit among these\r\norderly things. It is the first time I remember having that outlaw\r\nfeeling distinctly, a feeling that has played a large part in my\r\nsubsequent life. I felt there existed no place for me that I had to\r\ndrive myself in.\r\n\r\nPresently, down the hill, the servants appeared, straggling by twos and\r\nthrees, first some of the garden people and the butler’s wife with\r\nthem, then the two laundry maids, odd inseparable old creatures, then\r\nthe first footman talking to the butler’s little girl, and at last,\r\nwalking grave and breathless beside old Ann and Miss Fison, the black\r\nfigure of my mother.\r\n\r\nMy boyish mind suggested the adoption of a playful form of appearance.\r\n“Coo-ee, mother” said I, coming out against the sky, “Coo-ee!”\r\n\r\nMy mother looked up, went very white, and put her hand to her bosom.\r\n\r\nI suppose there was a fearful fuss about me. And of course I was quite\r\nunable to explain my reappearance. But I held out stoutly, “I won’t go\r\nback to Chatham; I’ll drown myself first.” The next day my mother\r\ncarried me off to Wimblehurst, took me fiercely and aggressively to an\r\nuncle I had never heard of before, near though the place was to us. She\r\ngave me no word as to what was to happen, and I was too subdued by her\r\nmanifest wrath and humiliation at my last misdemeanour to demand\r\ninformation. I don’t for one moment think Lady Drew was “nice” about\r\nme. The finality of my banishment was endorsed and underlined and\r\nstamped home. I wished very much now that I had run away to sea, in\r\nspite of the coal dust and squalour Rochester had revealed to me.\r\nPerhaps over seas one came to different lands.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI do not remember much of my journey to Wimblehurst with my mother\r\nexcept the image of her as sitting bolt upright, as rather disdaining\r\nthe third-class carriage in which we traveled, and how she looked away\r\nfrom me out of the window when she spoke of my uncle. “I have not seen\r\nyour uncle,” she said, “since he was a boy....” She added grudgingly,\r\n“Then he was supposed to be clever.”\r\n\r\nShe took little interest in such qualities as cleverness.\r\n\r\n“He married about three years ago, and set up for himself in\r\nWimblehurst.... So I suppose she had some money.”\r\n\r\nShe mused on scenes she had long dismissed from her mind. “Teddy,” she\r\nsaid at last in the tone of one who has been feeling in the dark and\r\nfinds. “He was called Teddy... about your age.... Now he must be\r\ntwenty-six or seven.”\r\n\r\nI thought of my uncle as Teddy directly I saw him; there was something\r\nin his personal appearance that in the light of that memory phrased\r\nitself at once as Teddiness—a certain Teddidity. To describe it in and\r\nother terms is more difficult. It is nimbleness without grace, and\r\nalertness without intelligence. He whisked out of his shop upon the\r\npavement, a short figure in grey and wearing grey carpet slippers; one\r\nhad a sense of a young fattish face behind gilt glasses, wiry hair that\r\nstuck up and forward over the forehead, an irregular nose that had its\r\naquiline moments, and that the body betrayed an equatorial laxity, an\r\nincipient “bow window” as the image goes. He jerked out of the shop,\r\ncame to a stand on the pavement outside, regarded something in the\r\nwindow with infinite appreciation, stroked his chin, and, as abruptly,\r\nshot sideways into the door again, charging through it as it were\r\nbehind an extended hand.\r\n\r\n“That must be him,” said my mother, catching at her breath.\r\n\r\nWe came past the window whose contents I was presently to know by\r\nheart, a very ordinary chemist’s window except that there was a\r\nfrictional electrical machine, an air pump and two or three tripods and\r\nretorts replacing the customary blue, yellow, and red bottles above.\r\nThere was a plaster of Paris horse to indicate veterinary medicines\r\namong these breakables, and below were scent packets and diffusers and\r\nsponges and soda-water syphons and such-like things. Only in the middle\r\nthere was a rubricated card, very neatly painted by hand, with these\r\nwords—\r\n\r\nBuy Ponderevo’s Cough Linctus _now_.\r\nNOW!\r\nWHY?\r\nTwopence Cheaper than in Winter.\r\nYou Store Apples! why not the Medicine\r\nYou are Bound to Need?\r\n\r\n\r\nin which appeal I was to recognise presently my uncle’s distinctive\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nMy uncle’s face appeared above a card of infant’s comforters in the\r\nglass pane of the door. I perceived his eyes were brown, and that his\r\nglasses creased his nose. It was manifest he did not know us from Adam.\r\nA stare of scrutiny allowed an expression of commercial deference to\r\nappear in front of it, and my uncle flung open the door.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know me?” panted my mother.\r\n\r\nMy uncle would not own he did not, but his curiosity was manifest. My\r\nmother sat down on one of the little chairs before the soap and patent\r\nmedicine-piled counter, and her lips opened and closed.\r\n\r\n“A glass of water, madam,” said my uncle, waved his hand in a sort of\r\ncurve and shot away.\r\n\r\nMy mother drank the water and spoke. “That boy,” she said, “takes after\r\nhis father. He grows more like him every day.... And so I have brought\r\nhim to you.”\r\n\r\n“His father, madam?”\r\n\r\n“George.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment the chemist was still at a loss. He stood behind the\r\ncounter with the glass my mother had returned to him in his hand. Then\r\ncomprehension grew.\r\n\r\n“By Gosh!” he said. “Lord!” he cried. His glasses fell off. He\r\ndisappeared replacing them, behind a pile of boxed-up bottles of blood\r\nmixture. “Eleven thousand virgins!” I heard him cry. The glass was\r\nbanged down. “O-ri-ental Gums!”\r\n\r\nHe shot away out of the shop through some masked door. One heard his\r\nvoice. “Susan! Susan!”\r\n\r\nThen he reappeared with an extended hand. “Well, how are you?” he said.\r\n“I was never so surprised in my life. Fancy!... _You!_”\r\n\r\nHe shook my mother’s impassive hand and then mine very warmly holding\r\nhis glasses on with his left forefinger.\r\n\r\n“Come right in!” he cried—“come right in! Better late than never!” and\r\nled the way into the parlour behind the shop.\r\n\r\nAfter Bladesover that apartment struck me as stuffy and petty, but it\r\nwas very comfortable in comparison with the Frapp living-room. It had a\r\nfaint, disintegrating smell of meals about it, and my most immediate\r\nimpression was of the remarkable fact that something was hung about or\r\nwrapped round or draped over everything. There was bright-patterned\r\nmuslin round the gas-bracket in the middle of the room, round the\r\nmirror over the mantel, stuff with ball-fringe along the mantel and\r\ncasing in the fireplace,—I first saw ball-fringe here—and even the lamp\r\non the little bureau wore a shade like a large muslin hat. The\r\ntable-cloth had ball-fringe and so had the window curtains, and the\r\ncarpet was a bed of roses. There were little cupboards on either side\r\nof the fireplace, and in the recesses, ill-made shelves packed with\r\nbooks, and enriched with pinked American cloth. There was a dictionary\r\nlying face downward on the table, and the open bureau was littered with\r\nfoolscap paper and the evidences of recently abandoned toil. My eye\r\ncaught “The Ponderevo Patent Flat, a Machine you can Live in,” written\r\nin large firm letters. My uncle opened a little door like a cupboard\r\ndoor in the corner of this room, and revealed the narrowest twist of\r\nstaircase I had ever set eyes upon. “Susan!” he bawled again. “Wantje.\r\nSome one to see you. Surprisin’.”\r\n\r\nThere came an inaudible reply, and a sudden loud bump over our heads as\r\nof some article of domestic utility pettishly flung aside, then the\r\ncautious steps of someone descending the twist, and then my aunt\r\nappeared in the doorway with her hand upon the jamb.\r\n\r\n“It’s Aunt Ponderevo,” cried my uncle. “George’s wife—and she’s brought\r\nover her son!” His eye roamed about the room. He darted to the bureau\r\nwith a sudden impulse, and turned the sheet about the patent flat face\r\ndown. Then he waved his glasses at us, “You know, Susan, my elder\r\nbrother George. I told you about ’im lots of times.”\r\n\r\nHe fretted across to the hearthrug and took up a position there,\r\nreplaced his glasses and coughed.\r\n\r\nMy aunt Susan seemed to be taking it in. She was then rather a pretty\r\nslender woman of twenty-three or four, I suppose, and I remember being\r\nstruck by the blueness of her eyes and the clear freshness of her\r\ncomplexion. She had little features, a button nose, a pretty chin and a\r\nlong graceful neck that stuck out of her pale blue cotton morning\r\ndress. There was a look of half-assumed perplexity on her face, a\r\nlittle quizzical wrinkle of the brow that suggested a faintly amused\r\nattempt to follow my uncle’s mental operations, a vain attempt and a\r\ncertain hopelessness that had in succession become habitual. She seemed\r\nto be saying, “Oh Lord! What’s he giving me _this_ time?” And as came\r\nto know her better I detected, as a complication of her effort of\r\napprehension, a subsidiary riddle to “What’s he giving me?” and that\r\nwas—to borrow a phrase from my schoolboy language “Is it keeps?” She\r\nlooked at my mother and me, and back to her husband again.\r\n\r\n“You know,” he said. “George.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said to my mother, descending the last three steps of the\r\nstaircase and holding out her hand! “you’re welcome. Though it’s a\r\nsurprise.... I can’t ask you to _have_ anything, I’m afraid, for there\r\nisn’t anything in the house.” She smiled, and looked at her husband\r\nbanteringly. “Unless he makes up something with his old chemicals,\r\nwhich he’s quite equal to doing.”\r\n\r\nMy mother shook hands stiffly, and told me to kiss my aunt....\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s all sit down,” said my uncle, suddenly whistling through\r\nhis clenched teeth, and briskly rubbing his hands together. He put up a\r\nchair for my mother, raised the blind of the little window, lowered it\r\nagain, and returned to his hearthrug. “I’m sure,” he said, as one who\r\ndecides, “I’m very glad to see you.”\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAs they talked I gave my attention pretty exclusively to my uncle.\r\n\r\nI noted him in great detail. I remember now his partially unbuttoned\r\nwaistcoat, as though something had occurred to distract him as he did\r\nit up, and a little cut upon his chin. I liked a certain humour in his\r\neyes. I watched, too, with the fascination that things have for an\r\nobservant boy, the play of his lips—they were a little oblique, and\r\nthere was something “slipshod,” if one may strain a word so far, about\r\nhis mouth, so that he lisped and sibilated ever and again and the\r\ncoming and going of a curious expression, triumphant in quality it was,\r\nupon his face as he talked. He fingered his glasses, which did not seem\r\nto fit his nose, fretted with things in his waistcoat pockets or put\r\nhis hands behind him, looked over our heads, and ever and again rose to\r\nhis toes and dropped back on his heels. He had a way of drawing air in\r\nat times through his teeth that gave a whispering zest to his speech\r\nIt’s a sound I can only represent as a soft Zzzz.\r\n\r\nHe did most of the talking. My mother repeated what she had already\r\nsaid in the shop, “I have brought George over to you,” and then\r\ndesisted for a time from the real business in hand. “You find this a\r\ncomfortable house?” she asked; and this being affirmed: “It looks—very\r\nconvenient.... Not too big to be a trouble—no. You like Wimblehurst, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\nMy uncle retorted with some inquiries about the great people of\r\nBladesover, and my mother answered in the character of a personal\r\nfriend of Lady Drew’s. The talk hung for a time, and then my uncle\r\nembarked upon a dissertation upon Wimblehurst.\r\n\r\n“This place,” he began, “isn’t of course quite the place I ought to be\r\nin.”\r\n\r\nMy mother nodded as though she had expected that.\r\n\r\n“It gives me no Scope,” he went on. “It’s dead-and-alive. Nothing\r\nhappens.”\r\n\r\n“He’s always wanting something to happen,” said my aunt Susan. “Some\r\nday he’ll get a shower of things and they’ll be too much for him.”\r\n\r\n“Not they,” said my uncle, buoyantly.\r\n\r\n“Do you find business—slack?” asked my mother.\r\n\r\n“Oh! one rubs along. But there’s no Development—no growth. They just\r\ncome along here and buy pills when they want ’em—and a horseball or\r\nsuch. They’ve got to be ill before there’s a prescription. That sort\r\nthey are. You can’t get ’em to launch out, you can’t get ’em to take up\r\nanything new. For instance, I’ve been trying lately—induce them to buy\r\ntheir medicines in advance, and in larger quantities. But they won’t\r\nlook for it! Then I tried to float a little notion of mine, sort of an\r\ninsurance scheme for colds; you pay so much a week, and when you’ve got\r\na cold you get a bottle of Cough Linctus so long as you can produce a\r\nsubstantial sniff. See? But Lord! they’ve no capacity for ideas, they\r\ndon’t catch on; no Jump about the place, no Life. Live!—they trickle,\r\nand what one has to do here is to trickle too—Zzzz.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t suit me,” said my uncle. “I’m the cascading sort.”\r\n\r\n“George was that,” said my mother after a pondering moment.\r\n\r\nMy aunt Susan took up the parable with an affectionate glance at her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n“He’s always trying to make his old business jump,” she said. “Always\r\nputting fresh cards in the window, or getting up to something. You’d\r\nhardly believe. It makes ME jump sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“But it does no good,” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“It does no good,” said his wife. “It’s not his miloo...”\r\n\r\nPresently they came upon a wide pause.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of their conversation there had been the promise of\r\nthis pause, and I pricked my ears. I knew perfectly what was bound to\r\ncome; they were going to talk of my father. I was enormously\r\nstrengthened in my persuasion when I found my mother’s eyes resting\r\nthoughtfully upon me in the silence, and than my uncle looked at me and\r\nthen my aunt. I struggled unavailingly to produce an expression of meek\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said my uncle, “that George will find it more amusing to\r\nhave a turn in the market-place than to sit here talking with us.\r\nThere’s a pair of stocks there, George—very interesting. Old-fashioned\r\nstocks.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind sitting here,” I said.\r\n\r\nMy uncle rose and in the most friendly way led me through the shop. He\r\nstood on his doorstep and jerked amiable directions to me.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t it sleepy, George, eh? There’s the butcher’s dog over there,\r\nasleep in the road-half an hour from midday! If the last Trump sounded\r\nI don’t believe it would wake. Nobody would wake! The chaps up there in\r\nthe churchyard—they’d just turn over and say: ‘Naar—you don’t catch us,\r\nyou don’t! See?’.... Well, you’ll find the stocks just round that\r\ncorner.”\r\n\r\nHe watched me out of sight.\r\n\r\nSo I never heard what they said about my father after all.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, my uncle had in some remarkable way become larger and\r\ncentral. “Tha’chu, George?” he cried, when the shop-door bell sounded.\r\n“Come right through”; and I found him, as it were, in the chairman’s\r\nplace before the draped grate.\r\n\r\nThe three of them regarded me.\r\n\r\n“We have been talking of making you a chemist, George,” said my uncle.\r\n\r\nMy mother looked at me. “I had hoped,” she said, “that Lady Drew would\r\nhave done something for him—” She stopped.\r\n\r\n“In what way?” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“She might have spoken to some one, got him into something perhaps....”\r\nShe had the servant’s invincible persuasion that all good things are\r\ndone by patronage.\r\n\r\n“He is not the sort of boy for whom things are done,” she added,\r\ndismissing these dreams. “He doesn’t accommodate himself. When he\r\nthinks Lady Drew wishes a thing, he seems not to wish it. Towards Mr.\r\nRedgrave, too, he has been—disrespectful—he is like his father.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s Mr. Redgrave?”\r\n\r\n“The Vicar.”\r\n\r\n“A bit independent?” said my uncle, briskly.\r\n\r\n“Disobedient,” said my mother. “He has no idea of his place. He seems\r\nto think he can get on by slighting people and flouting them. He’ll\r\nlearn perhaps before it is too late.”\r\n\r\nMy uncle stroked his cut chin and me. “Have you learnt any Latin?” he\r\nasked abruptly.\r\n\r\nI said I had not.\r\n\r\n“He’ll have to learn a little Latin,” he explained to my mother, “to\r\nqualify. H’m. He could go down to the chap at the grammar school\r\nhere—it’s just been routed into existence again by the Charity\r\nCommissioners and have lessons.”\r\n\r\n“What, me learn Latin!” I cried, with emotion.\r\n\r\n“A little,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I’ve always wanted” I said and; “_Latin!_”\r\n\r\nI had long been obsessed by the idea that having no Latin was a\r\ndisadvantage in the world, and Archie Garvell had driven the point of\r\nthis pretty earnestly home. The literature I had read at Bladesover had\r\nall tended that way. Latin had had a quality of emancipation for me\r\nthat I find it difficult to convey. And suddenly, when I had supposed\r\nall learning was at an end for me, I heard this!\r\n\r\n“It’s no good to you, of course,” said my uncle, “except to pass exams\r\nwith, but there you are!”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to learn Latin because you have to learn Latin,” said my\r\nmother, “not because you want to. And afterwards you will have to learn\r\nall sorts of other things....”\r\n\r\nThe idea that I was to go on learning, that to read and master the\r\ncontents of books was still to be justifiable as a duty, overwhelmed\r\nall other facts. I had had it rather clear in my mind for some weeks\r\nthat all that kind of opportunity might close to me for ever. I began\r\nto take a lively interest in this new project.\r\n\r\n“Then shall I live here?” I asked, “with you, and study... as well as\r\nwork in the shop?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the way of it,” said my uncle.\r\n\r\nI parted from my mother that day in a dream, so sudden and important\r\nwas this new aspect of things to me. I was to learn Latin! Now that the\r\nhumiliation of my failure at Bladesover was past for her, now that she\r\nhad a little got over her first intense repugnance at this resort to my\r\nuncle and contrived something that seemed like a possible provision for\r\nmy future, the tenderness natural to a parting far more significant\r\nthan any of our previous partings crept into her manner.\r\n\r\nShe sat in the train to return, I remember, and I stood at the open\r\ndoor of her compartment, and neither of us knew how soon we should\r\ncease for ever to be a trouble to one another.\r\n\r\n“You must be a good boy, George,” she said. “You must learn.... And you\r\nmustn’t set yourself up against those who are above you and better than\r\nyou.... Or envy them.”\r\n\r\n“No, mother,” I said.\r\n\r\nI promised carelessly. Her eyes were fixed upon me. I was wondering\r\nwhether I could by any means begin Latin that night.\r\n\r\nSomething touched her heart then, some thought, some memory; perhaps\r\nsome premonition.... The solitary porter began slamming carriage doors.\r\n\r\n“George” she said hastily, almost shamefully, “kiss me!”\r\n\r\nI stepped up into her compartment as she bent downward.\r\n\r\nShe caught me in her arms quite eagerly, she pressed me to her—a\r\nstrange thing for her to do. I perceived her eyes were extraordinarily\r\nbright, and then this brightness burst along the lower lids and rolled\r\ndown her cheeks.\r\n\r\nFor the first and last time in my life I saw my mother’s tears. Then\r\nshe had gone, leaving me discomforted and perplexed, forgetting for a\r\ntime even that I was to learn Latin, thinking of my mother as of\r\nsomething new and strange.\r\n\r\nThe thing recurred though I sought to dismiss it, it stuck itself into\r\nmy memory against the day of fuller understanding. Poor, proud,\r\nhabitual, sternly narrow soul! poor difficult and misunderstanding son!\r\nit was the first time that ever it dawned upon me that my mother also\r\nmight perhaps feel.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nMy mother died suddenly and, it was thought by Lady Drew,\r\ninconsiderately, the following spring. Her ladyship instantly fled to\r\nFolkestone with Miss Somerville and Fison, until the funeral should be\r\nover and my mother’s successor installed.\r\n\r\nMy uncle took me over to the funeral. I remember there was a sort of\r\nprolonged crisis in the days preceding this because, directly he heard\r\nof my loss, he had sent a pair of check trousers to the Judkins people\r\nin London to be dyed black, and they did not come back in time. He\r\nbecame very excited on the third day, and sent a number of increasingly\r\nfiery telegrams without any result whatever, and succumbed next morning\r\nwith a very ill grace to my aunt Susan’s insistence upon the resources\r\nof his dress-suit. In my memory those black legs of his, in a\r\nparticularly thin and shiny black cloth—for evidently his dress-suit\r\ndated from adolescent and slenderer days—straddle like the Colossus of\r\nRhodes over my approach to my mother’s funeral. Moreover, I was\r\ninconvenienced and distracted by a silk hat he had bought me, my first\r\nsilk hat, much ennobled, as his was also, by a deep mourning band.\r\n\r\nI remember, but rather indistinctly, my mother’s white paneled\r\nhousekeeper’s room and the touch of oddness about it that she was not\r\nthere, and the various familiar faces made strange by black, and I seem\r\nto recall the exaggerated self-consciousness that arose out of their\r\nfocussed attention. No doubt the sense of the new silk hat came and\r\nwent and came again in my emotional chaos. Then something comes out\r\nclear and sorrowful, rises out clear and sheer from among all these\r\nrather base and inconsequent things, and once again I walk before all\r\nthe other mourners close behind her coffin as it is carried along the\r\nchurchyard path to her grave, with the old vicar’s slow voice saying\r\nregretfully and unconvincingly above me, triumphant solemn things.\r\n\r\n“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord; he that believeth\r\nin me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and\r\nbelieveth in me shall never die.”\r\n\r\nNever die! The day was a high and glorious morning in spring, and all\r\nthe trees were budding and bursting into green. Everywhere there were\r\nblossoms and flowers; the pear trees and cherry trees in the sexton’s\r\ngarden were sunlit snow, there were nodding daffodils and early tulips\r\nin the graveyard beds, great multitudes of daisies, and everywhere the\r\nbirds seemed singing. And in the middle was the brown coffin end,\r\ntilting on men’s shoulders and half occluded by the vicar’s Oxford\r\nhood.\r\n\r\nAnd so we came to my mother’s waiting grave.\r\n\r\nFor a time I was very observant, watching the coffin lowered, hearing\r\nthe words of the ritual. It seemed a very curious business altogether.\r\n\r\nSuddenly as the service drew to its end, I felt something had still to\r\nbe said which had not been said, realised that she had withdrawn in\r\nsilence, neither forgiving me nor hearing from me—those now lost\r\nassurances. Suddenly I knew I had not understood. Suddenly I saw her\r\ntenderly; remembered not so much tender or kindly things of her as her\r\ncrossed wishes and the ways in which I had thwarted her. Surprisingly I\r\nrealised that behind all her hardness and severity she had loved me,\r\nthat I was the only thing she had ever loved and that until this moment\r\nI had never loved her. And now she was there and deaf and blind to me,\r\npitifully defeated in her designs for me, covered from me so that she\r\ncould not know....\r\n\r\nI dug my nails into the palms of my hands, I set my teeth, but tears\r\nblinded me, sobs would have choked me had speech been required of me.\r\nThe old vicar read on, there came a mumbled response—and so on to the\r\nend. I wept as it were internally, and only when we had come out of the\r\nchurchyard could I think and speak calmly again.\r\n\r\nStamped across this memory are the little black figures of my uncle and\r\nRabbits, telling Avebury, the sexton and undertaker, that “it had all\r\npassed off very well—very well indeed.”\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThat is the last I shall tell of Bladesover. The dropscene falls on\r\nthat, and it comes no more as an actual presence into this novel. I did\r\nindeed go back there once again, but under circumstances quite\r\nimmaterial to my story. But in a sense Bladesover has never left me; it\r\nis, as I said at the outset, one of those dominant explanatory\r\nimpressions that make the framework of my mind. Bladesover illuminates\r\nEngland; it has become all that is spacious, dignified pretentious, and\r\ntruly conservative in English life. It is my social datum. That is why\r\nI have drawn it here on so large a scale.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back at last to the real Bladesover on an inconsequent\r\nvisit, everything was far smaller than I could have supposed possible.\r\nIt was as though everything had shivered and shrivelled a little at the\r\nLichtenstein touch. The harp was still in the saloon, but there was a\r\ndifferent grand piano with a painted lid and a metrostyle pianola, and\r\nan extraordinary quantity of artistic litter and _bric-à-brac_\r\nscattered about. There was the trail of the Bond Street showroom over\r\nit all. The furniture was still under chintz, but it wasn’t the same\r\nsort of chintz although it pretended to be, and the lustre-dangling\r\nchandeliers had passed away. Lady Lichtenstein’s books replaced the\r\nbrown volumes I had browsed among—they were mostly presentation copies\r\nof contemporary novels and the _National Review_ and the _Empire\r\nReview_, and the _Nineteenth Century and After_ jostled current books\r\non the tables—English new books in gaudy catchpenny “artistic” covers,\r\nFrench and Italian novels in yellow, German art handbooks of almost\r\nincredible ugliness. There were abundant evidences that her ladyship\r\nwas playing with the Keltic renascence, and a great number of ugly cats\r\nmade of china—she “collected” china and stoneware cats—stood about\r\neverywhere—in all colours, in all kinds of deliberately comic, highly\r\nglazed distortion.\r\n\r\nIt is nonsense to pretend that finance makes any better aristocrats\r\nthan rent. Nothing can make an aristocrat but pride, knowledge,\r\ntraining, and the sword. These people were no improvement on the Drews,\r\nnone whatever. There was no effect of a beneficial replacement of\r\npassive unintelligent people by active intelligent ones. One felt that\r\na smaller but more enterprising and intensely undignified variety of\r\nstupidity had replaced the large dullness of the old gentry, and that\r\nwas all. Bladesover, I thought, had undergone just the same change\r\nbetween the seventies and the new century that had overtaken the dear\r\nold _Times_, and heaven knows how much more of the decorous British\r\nfabric. These Lichtensteins and their like seem to have no promise in\r\nthem at all of any fresh vitality for the kingdom. I do not believe in\r\ntheir intelligence or their power—they have nothing new about them at\r\nall, nothing creative nor rejuvenescent, no more than a disorderly\r\ninstinct of acquisition; and the prevalence of them and their kind is\r\nbut a phase in the broad slow decay of the great social organism of\r\nEngland. They could not have made Bladesover they cannot replace it;\r\nthey just happen to break out over it—saprophytically.\r\n\r\nWell—that was my last impression of Bladesover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\r\nTHE WIMBLEHURST APPRENTICESHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSo far as I can remember now, except for that one emotional phase by\r\nthe graveside, I passed through all these experiences rather callously.\r\nI had already, with the facility of youth, changed my world, ceased to\r\nthink at all of the old school routine and put Bladesover aside for\r\ndigestion at a latter stage. I took up my new world in Wimblehurst with\r\nthe chemist’s shop as its hub, set to work at Latin and materia medica,\r\nand concentrated upon the present with all my heart. Wimblehurst is an\r\nexceptionally quiet and grey Sussex town rare among south of England\r\ntowns in being largely built of stone. I found something very agreeable\r\nand picturesque in its clean cobbled streets, its odd turnings and\r\nabrupt corners; and in the pleasant park that crowds up one side of the\r\ntown. The whole place is under the Eastry dominion and it was the\r\nEastry influence and dignity that kept its railway station a mile and\r\nthree-quarters away. Eastry House is so close that it dominates the\r\nwhole; one goes across the marketplace (with its old lock-up and\r\nstocks), past the great pre-reformation church, a fine grey shell, like\r\nsome empty skull from which the life has fled, and there at once are\r\nthe huge wrought-iron gates, and one peeps through them to see the\r\nfaçade of this place, very white and large and fine, down a long avenue\r\nof yews. Eastry was far greater than Bladesover and an altogether\r\ncompleter example of the eighteenth century system. It ruled not two\r\nvillages, but a borough, that had sent its sons and cousins to\r\nparliament almost as a matter of right so long as its franchise\r\nendured. Every one was in the system, every one—except my uncle. He\r\nstood out and complained.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was the first real breach I found in the great front of\r\nBladesover the world had presented me, for Chatham was not so much a\r\nbreach as a confirmation. But my uncle had no respect for Bladesover\r\nand Eastry—none whatever. He did not believe in them. He was blind even\r\nto what they were. He propounded strange phrases about them, he\r\nexfoliated and wagged about novel and incredible ideas.\r\n\r\n“This place,” said my uncle, surveying it from his open doorway in the\r\ndignified stillness of a summer afternoon, “wants Waking Up!”\r\n\r\nI was sorting up patent medicines in the corner.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to let a dozen young Americans loose into it,” said my uncle.\r\n“Then we’d see.”\r\n\r\nI made a tick against Mother Shipton’s Sleeping Syrup. We had cleared\r\nour forward stock.\r\n\r\n“Things must be happening _somewhere_, George,” he broke out in a\r\nquerulously rising note as he came back into the little shop. He\r\nfiddled with the piled dummy boxes of fancy soap and scent and so forth\r\nthat adorned the end of the counter, then turned about petulantly,\r\nstuck his hands deeply into his pockets and withdrew one to scratch his\r\nhead. “I must do _something_,” he said. “I can’t stand it.\r\n\r\n“I must invent something. And shove it.... I could.\r\n\r\n“Or a play. There’s a deal of money in a play, George. What would you\r\nthink of me writing a play eh?... There’s all sorts of things to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n“Or the stog-igschange.”\r\n\r\nHe fell into that meditative whistling of his.\r\n\r\n“Sac-ramental wine!” he swore, “this isn’t the world—it’s Cold Mutton\r\nFat! That’s what Wimblehurst is! Cold Mutton Fat!—dead and stiff! And\r\nI’m buried in it up to the arm pits. Nothing ever happens, nobody wants\r\nthings to happen ‘scept me! Up in London, George, things happen.\r\nAmerica! I wish to Heaven, George, I’d been born American—where things\r\nhum.\r\n\r\n“What can one do here? How can one grow? While we’re sleepin’ here with\r\nour Capital oozing away into Lord Eastry’s pockets for rent-men are up\r\nthere....” He indicated London as remotely over the top of the\r\ndispensing counter, and then as a scene of great activity by a whirl of\r\nthe hand and a wink and a meaning smile at me.\r\n\r\n“What sort of things do they do?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Rush about,” he said. “Do things! Somethin’ glorious. There’s cover\r\ngambling. Ever heard of that, George?” He drew the air in through his\r\nteeth. “You put down a hundred say, and buy ten thousand pounds worth.\r\nSee? That’s a cover of one per cent. Things go up one, you sell,\r\nrealise cent per cent; down, whiff, it’s gone! Try again! Cent per\r\ncent, George, every day. Men are made or done for in an hour. And the\r\nshoutin’! Zzzz.... Well, that’s one way, George. Then another\r\nway—there’s Corners!”\r\n\r\n“They’re rather big things, aren’t they?” I ventured.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you go in for wheat or steel—yes. But suppose you tackled a\r\nlittle thing, George. Just some little thing that only needed a few\r\nthousands. Drugs for example. Shoved all you had into it—staked your\r\nliver on it, so to speak. Take a drug—take ipecac, for example. Take a\r\nlot of ipecac. Take all there is! See? There you are! There aren’t\r\nunlimited supplies of ipecacuanha—can’t be!—and it’s a thing people\r\nmust have. Then quinine again! You watch your chance, wait for a\r\ntropical war breaking out, let’s say, and collar all the quinine. Where\r\nARE they? Must have quinine, you know. Eh? Zzzz.\r\n\r\n“Lord! there’s no end of things—no end of _little_ things.\r\nDill-water—all the suffering babes yowling for it. Eucalyptus\r\nagain—cascara—witch hazel—menthol—all the toothache things. Then\r\nthere’s antiseptics, and curare, cocaine....”\r\n\r\n“Rather a nuisance to the doctors,” I reflected.\r\n\r\n“They got to look out for themselves. By Jove, yes. They’ll do you if\r\nthey can, and you do them. Like brigands. That makes it romantic.\r\nThat’s the Romance of Commerce, George. You’re in the mountains there!\r\nThink of having all the quinine in the world, and some millionaire’s\r\npampered wife gone ill with malaria, eh? That’s a squeeze, George, eh?\r\nEh? Millionaire on his motor car outside, offering you any price you\r\nliked. That ’ud wake up Wimblehurst.... Lord! You haven’t an Idea down\r\nhere. Not an idea. Zzzz.”\r\n\r\nHe passed into a rapt dream, from which escaped such fragments as:\r\n“Fifty per cent. advance sir; security—to-morrow. Zzzz.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of cornering a drug struck upon my mind then as a sort of\r\nirresponsible monkey trick that no one would ever be permitted to do in\r\nreality. It was the sort of nonsense one would talk to make Ewart laugh\r\nand set him going on to still odder possibilities. I thought it was\r\npart of my uncle’s way of talking. But I’ve learnt differently since.\r\nThe whole trend of modern money-making is to foresee something that\r\nwill presently be needed and put it out of reach, and then to haggle\r\nyourself wealthy. You buy up land upon which people will presently want\r\nto build houses, you secure rights that will bar vitally important\r\ndevelopments, and so on, and so on. Of course the naïve intelligence of\r\na boy does not grasp the subtler developments of human inadequacy. He\r\nbegins life with a disposition to believe in the wisdom of grown-up\r\npeople, he does not realise how casual and disingenuous has been the\r\ndevelopment of law and custom, and he thinks that somewhere in the\r\nstate there is a power as irresistible as a head master’s to check\r\nmischievous and foolish enterprises of every sort. I will confess that\r\nwhen my uncle talked of cornering quinine, I had a clear impression\r\nthat any one who contrived to do that would pretty certainly go to\r\njail. Now I know that any one who could really bring it off would be\r\nmuch more likely to go to the House of Lords!\r\n\r\nMy uncle ranged over the gilt labels of his bottles and drawers for a\r\nwhile, dreaming of corners in this and that. But at last he reverted to\r\nWimblehurst again.\r\n\r\n“You got to be in London when these things are in hand. Down here—!\r\n\r\n“Jee-rusalem!” he cried. “Why did I plant myself here? Everything’s\r\ndone. The game’s over. Here’s Lord Eastry, and he’s got everything,\r\nexcept what his lawyers get, and before you get any more change this\r\nway you’ll have to dynamite him—and them. _He_ doesn’t want anything\r\nmore to happen. Why should he? Any chance ’ud be a loss to him. He\r\nwants everything to burble along and burble along and go on as it’s\r\ngoing for the next ten thousand years, Eastry after Eastry, one parson\r\ndown another come, one grocer dead, get another! Any one with any ideas\r\nbetter go away. They _have_ gone away! Look at all these blessed people\r\nin this place! Look at ’em! All fast asleep, doing their business out\r\nof habit—in a sort of dream, Stuffed men would do just as well—just.\r\nThey’ve all shook down into their places. _They_ don’t want anything to\r\nhappen either. They’re all broken in. There you are! Only what are they\r\nall alive for?...\r\n\r\n“Why can’t they get a clockwork chemist?”\r\n\r\nHe concluded as he often concluded these talks. “I must invent\r\nsomething,—that’s about what I must do. Zzzz. Some convenience.\r\nSomething people want.... Strike out.... You can’t think, George, of\r\nanything everybody wants and hasn’t got? I mean something you could\r\nturn out retail under a shilling, say? Well, _you_ think, whenever you\r\nhaven’t got anything better to do. See?”\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSo I remember my uncle in that first phase, young, but already a little\r\nfat, restless, fretful, garrulous, putting in my fermenting head all\r\nsorts of discrepant ideas. Certainly he was educational....\r\n\r\nFor me the years at Wimblehurst were years of pretty active growth.\r\nMost of my leisure and much of my time in the shop I spent in study. I\r\nspeedily mastered the modicum of Latin necessary for my qualifying\r\nexaminations, and—a little assisted by the Government Science and Art\r\nDepartment classes that were held in the Grammar School—went on with my\r\nmathematics. There were classes in physics, in chemistry, in\r\nmathematics and machine drawing, and I took up these subjects with\r\nconsiderable avidity. Exercise I got chiefly in the form of walks.\r\nThere was some cricket in the summer and football in the winter\r\nsustained by young men’s clubs that levied a parasitic blackmail of the\r\nbig people and the sitting member, but I was never very keen at these\r\ngames. I didn’t find any very close companions among the youths of\r\nWimblehurst. They struck me, after my cockney schoolmates, as loutish\r\nand slow, servile and furtive, spiteful and mean. _We_ used to swagger,\r\nbut these countrymen dragged their feet and hated an equal who didn’t;\r\nwe talked loud, but you only got the real thoughts of Wimblehurst in a\r\nknowing undertone behind its hand. And even then they weren’t much in\r\nthe way of thoughts.\r\n\r\nNo, I didn’t like those young countrymen, and I’m no believer in the\r\nEnglish countryside under the Bladesover system as a breeding ground\r\nfor honourable men. One hears a frightful lot of nonsense about the\r\nRural Exodus and the degeneration wrought by town life upon our\r\npopulation. To my mind, the English townsman, even in the slums, is\r\ninfinitely better spiritually, more courageous, more imaginative and\r\ncleaner, than his agricultural cousin. I’ve seen them both when they\r\ndidn’t think they were being observed, and I know. There was something\r\nabout my Wimblehurst companions that disgusted me. It’s hard to define.\r\nHeaven knows that at that cockney boarding-school at Goudhurst we were\r\ncoarse enough; the Wimblehurst youngsters had neither words nor courage\r\nfor the sort of thing we used to do—for our bad language, for example;\r\nbut, on the other hand, they displayed a sort of sluggish, real\r\nlewdness, lewdness is the word—a baseness of attitude. Whatever we\r\nexiled urbans did at Goudhurst was touched with something, however\r\ncoarse, of romantic imagination. We had read the _Boys of England_, and\r\ntold each other stories. In the English countryside there are no books\r\nat all, no songs, no drama, no valiant sin even; all these things have\r\nnever come or they were taken away and hidden generations ago, and the\r\nimagination aborts and bestialises. That, I think, is where the real\r\ndifference against the English rural man lies. It is because I know\r\nthis that I do not share in the common repinings because our\r\ncountryside is being depopulated, because our population is passing\r\nthrough the furnace of the towns. They starve, they suffer, no doubt,\r\nbut they come out of it hardened, they come out of it with souls.\r\n\r\nOf an evening the Wimblehurst blade, shiny-faced from a wash and with\r\nsome loud finery, a coloured waistcoat or a vivid tie, would betake\r\nhimself to the Eastry Arms billiard-room, or to the bar parlour of some\r\nminor pub where nap could be played. One soon sickened of his slow\r\nknowingness, the cunning observation of his deadened eyes, his idea of\r\na “good story,” always, always told in undertones, poor dirty worm! his\r\nshrewd, elaborate maneuvers for some petty advantage, a drink to the\r\ngood or such-like deal. There rises before my eyes as I write, young\r\nHopley Dodd, the son of the Wimblehurst auctioneer, the pride of\r\nWimblehurst, its finest flower, with his fur waistcoat and his bulldog\r\npipe, his riding breeches—he had no horse—and his gaiters, as he used\r\nto sit, leaning forward and watching the billiard-table from under the\r\nbrim of his artfully tilted hat. A half-dozen phrases constituted his\r\nconversation: “hard lines!” he used to say, and “Good baazness,” in a\r\nbass bleat. Moreover, he had a long slow whistle that was esteemed the\r\nvery cream of humorous comment. Night after night he was there.\r\n\r\nAlso you knew he would not understand that _I_ could play billiards,\r\nand regarded every stroke I made as a fluke. For a beginner I didn’t\r\nplay so badly, I thought. I’m not so sure now; that was my opinion at\r\nthe time. But young Dodd’s scepticism and the “good baazness” finally\r\ncured me of my disposition to frequent the Eastry Arms, and so these\r\nnoises had their value in my world.\r\n\r\nI made no friends among the young men of the place at all, and though I\r\nwas entering upon adolescence I have no love-affair to tell of here.\r\nNot that I was not waking up to that aspect of life in my middle teens\r\nI did, indeed, in various slightly informal ways scrape acquaintance\r\nwith casual Wimblehurst girls; with a little dressmaker’s apprentice I\r\ngot upon shyly speaking terms, and a pupil teacher in the National\r\nSchool went further and was “talked about” in connection with me but I\r\nwas not by any means touched by any reality of passion for either of\r\nthese young people; love—love as yet came to me only in my dreams. I\r\nonly kissed these girls once or twice. They rather disconcerted than\r\ndeveloped those dreams. They were so clearly not “it.” I shall have\r\nmuch to say of love in this story, but I may break it to the reader now\r\nthat it is my role to be a rather ineffectual lover. Desire I knew well\r\nenough—indeed, too well; but love I have been shy of. In all my early\r\nenterprises in the war of the sexes, I was torn between the urgency of\r\nthe body and a habit of romantic fantasy that wanted every phase of the\r\nadventure to be generous and beautiful. And I had a curiously haunting\r\nmemory of Beatrice, of her kisses in the bracken and her kiss upon the\r\nwall, that somehow pitched the standard too high for Wimblehurst’s\r\nopportunities. I will not deny I did in a boyish way attempt a shy,\r\nrude adventure or so in love-making at Wimblehurst; but through these\r\nvarious influences, I didn’t bring things off to any extent at all. I\r\nleft behind me no devastating memories, no splendid reputation. I came\r\naway at last, still inexperienced and a little thwarted, with only a\r\nnatural growth of interest and desire in sexual things.\r\n\r\nIf I fell in love with any one in Wimblehurst it was with my aunt. She\r\ntreated me with a kindliness that was only half maternal—she petted my\r\nbooks, she knew about my certificates, she made fun of me in a way that\r\nstirred my heart to her. Quite unconsciously I grew fond of her....\r\n\r\nMy adolescent years at Wimblehurst were on the whole laborious,\r\nuneventful years that began in short jackets and left me in many ways\r\nnearly a man, years so uneventful that the Calculus of Variations is\r\nassociated with one winter, and an examination in Physics for Science\r\nand Art department Honours marks an epoch. Many divergent impulses\r\nstirred within me, but the master impulse was a grave young disposition\r\nto work and learn and thereby in some not very clearly defined way get\r\nout of the Wimblehurst world into which I had fallen. I wrote with some\r\nfrequency to Ewart, self-conscious, but, as I remember them, not\r\nintelligent letters, dated in Latin and with lapses into Latin\r\nquotation that roused Ewart to parody. There was something about me in\r\nthose days more than a little priggish. But it was, to do myself\r\njustice, something more than the petty pride of learning. I had a very\r\ngrave sense of discipline and preparation that I am not ashamed at all\r\nto remember. I was serious. More serious than I am at the present time.\r\nMore serious, indeed, than any adult seems to be. I was capable then of\r\nefforts—of nobilities.... They are beyond me now. I don’t see why, at\r\nforty, I shouldn’t confess I respect my own youth. I had dropped being\r\na boy quite abruptly. I thought I was presently to go out into a larger\r\nand quite important world and do significant things there. I thought I\r\nwas destined to do something definite to a world that had a definite\r\npurpose. I did not understand then, as I do now, that life was to\r\nconsist largely in the world’s doing things to me. Young people never\r\ndo seem to understand that aspect of things. And, as I say, among my\r\neducational influences my uncle, all unsuspected, played a leading\r\npart, and perhaps among other things gave my discontent with\r\nWimblehurst, my desire to get away from that clean and picturesque\r\nemptiness, a form and expression that helped to emphasise it. In a way\r\nthat definition made me patient. “Presently I shall get to London,” I\r\nsaid, echoing him.\r\n\r\nI remember him now as talking, always talking, in those days. He talked\r\nto me of theology, he talked of politics, of the wonders of science and\r\nthe marvels of art, of the passions and the affections, of the\r\nimmortality of the soul and the peculiar actions of drugs; but\r\npredominantly and constantly he talked of getting on, of enterprises,\r\nof inventions and great fortunes, of Rothschilds, silver kings,\r\nVanderbilts, Goulds, flotations, realisations and the marvelous ways of\r\nChance with men—in all localities, that is to say, that are not\r\nabsolutely sunken to the level of Cold Mutton Fat.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of those early talks, I figure him always in one of three\r\npositions. Either we were in the dispensing lair behind a high barrier,\r\nhe pounding up things in a mortar perhaps, and I rolling pill-stuff\r\ninto long rolls and cutting it up with a sort of broad, fluted knife,\r\nor he stood looking out of the shop door against the case of sponges\r\nand spray-diffusers, while I surveyed him from behind the counter, or\r\nhe leant against the little drawers behind the counter, and I hovered\r\ndusting in front. The thought of those early days brings back to my\r\nnostrils the faint smell of scent that was always in the air, marbled\r\nnow with streaks of this drug and now of that, and to my eyes the rows\r\nof jejune glass bottles with gold labels, mirror-reflected, that stood\r\nbehind him. My aunt, I remember, used sometimes to come into the shop\r\nin a state of aggressive sprightliness, a sort of connubial ragging\r\nexpedition, and get much fun over the abbreviated Latinity of those\r\ngilt inscriptions. “Ol Amjig, George,” she would read derisively, “and\r\nhe pretends it’s almond oil! Snap!—and that’s mustard. Did you _ever_,\r\nGeorge?\r\n\r\n“Look at him, George, looking dignified. I’d like to put an old label\r\non to _him_ round the middle like his bottles are, with Ol Pondo on it.\r\nThat’s Latin for Impostor, George _must_ be. He’d look lovely with a\r\nstopper.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ want a stopper,” said my uncle, projecting his face....\r\n\r\nMy aunt, dear soul, was in those days quite thin and slender, with a\r\ndelicate rosebud completion and a disposition to connubial badinage, to\r\na sort of gentle skylarking. There was a silvery ghost of lisping in\r\nher speech. She was a great humourist, and as the constraint of my\r\npresence at meals wore off, I became more and more aware of a filmy but\r\nextensive net of nonsense she had woven about her domestic relations\r\nuntil it had become the reality of her life. She affected a derisive\r\nattitude to the world at large and applied the epithet “old” to more\r\nthings than I have ever heard linked to it before or since. “Here’s the\r\nold news-paper,” she used to say—to my uncle. “Now don’t go and get it\r\nin the butter, you silly old Sardine!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the day of the week, Susan?” my uncle would ask.\r\n\r\n“Old Monday, Sossidge,” she would say, and add, “I got all my Old\r\nWashing to do. Don’t I _know_ it!”...\r\n\r\nShe had evidently been the wit and joy of a large circle of\r\nschoolfellows, and this style had become a second nature with her. It\r\nmade her very delightful to me in that quiet place. Her customary walk\r\neven had a sort of hello! in it. Her chief preoccupation in life was, I\r\nbelieve, to make my uncle laugh, and when by some new nickname, some\r\nnew quaintness or absurdity, she achieved that end, she was, behind a\r\nmask of sober amazement, the happiest woman on earth. My uncle’s laugh\r\nwhen it did come, I must admit was, as Baedeker says, “rewarding.” It\r\nbegan with gusty blowings and snortings, and opened into a clear “Ha\r\nha!” but in fullest development it included, in those youthful days,\r\nfalling about anyhow and doubling up tightly, and whackings of the\r\nstomach, and tears and cries of anguish. I never in my life heard my\r\nuncle laugh to his maximum except at her; he was commonly too much in\r\nearnest for that, and he didn’t laugh much at all, to my knowledge,\r\nafter those early years. Also she threw things at him to an enormous\r\nextent in her resolve to keep things lively in spite of Wimblehurst;\r\nsponges out of stock she threw, cushions, balls of paper, clean\r\nwashing, bread; and once up the yard when they thought that I and the\r\nerrand boy and the diminutive maid of all work were safely out of the\r\nway, she smashed a boxful of eight-ounce bottles I had left to drain,\r\nassaulting my uncle with a new soft broom. Sometimes she would shy\r\nthings at me—but not often. There seemed always laughter round and\r\nabout her—all three of us would share hysterics at times—and on one\r\noccasion the two of them came home from church shockingly ashamed of\r\nthemselves, because of a storm of mirth during the sermon. The vicar,\r\nit seems, had tried to blow his nose with a black glove as well as the\r\ncustomary pocket-handkerchief. And afterwards she had picked up her own\r\nglove by the finger, and looking innocently but intently sideways, had\r\nsuddenly by this simple expedient exploded my uncle altogether. We had\r\nit all over again at dinner.\r\n\r\n“But it shows you,” cried my uncle, suddenly becoming grave, “what\r\nWimblehurst is, to have us all laughing at a little thing like that! We\r\nweren’t the only ones that giggled. Not by any means! And, Lord! it\r\n_was_ funny!”\r\n\r\nSocially, my uncle and aunt were almost completely isolated. In places\r\nlike Wimblehurst the tradesmen’s lives always are isolated socially,\r\nall of them, unless they have a sister or a bosom friend among the\r\nother wives, but the husbands met in various bar-parlours or in the\r\nbilliard-room of the Eastry Arms. But my uncle, for the most part,\r\nspent his evenings at home. When first he arrived in Wimblehurst I\r\nthink he had spread his effect of abounding ideas and enterprise rather\r\ntoo aggressively; and Wimblehurst, after a temporary subjugation, had\r\nrebelled and done its best to make a butt of him. His appearance in a\r\npublic-house led to a pause in any conversation that was going on.\r\n\r\n“Come to tell us about everything, Mr. Pond’revo?” some one would say\r\npolitely.\r\n\r\n“You wait,” my uncle used to answer, disconcerted, and sulk for the\r\nrest of his visit.\r\n\r\nOr some one with an immense air of innocence would remark to the world\r\ngenerally, “They’re talkin’ of rebuildin’ Wimblehurst all over again,\r\nI’m told. Anybody heard anything of it? Going to make it a reg’lar\r\nsmartgoin’, enterprisin’ place—kind of Crystal Pallas.”\r\n\r\n“Earthquake and a pestilence before you get _that_,” my uncle would\r\nmutter, to the infinite delight of every one, and add something\r\ninaudible about “Cold Mutton Fat.”...\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWe were torn apart by a financial accident to my uncle of which I did\r\nnot at first grasp the full bearings. He had developed what I regarded\r\nas an innocent intellectual recreation which he called stock-market\r\nmeteorology. I think he got the idea from one use of curves in the\r\ngraphic presentation of associated variations that he saw me plotting.\r\nHe secured some of my squared paper and, having cast about for a time,\r\ndecided to trace the rise and fall of certain lines and railways.\r\n“There’s something in this, George,” he said, and I little dreamt that\r\namong other things that were in it, was the whole of his spare money\r\nand most of what my mother had left to him in trust for me.\r\n\r\n“It’s as plain as can be,” he said. “See, here’s one system of waves\r\nand here’s another! These are prices for Union Pacifics—extending over\r\na month. Now next week, mark my words, they’ll be down one whole point.\r\nWe’re getting near the steep part of the curve again. See? It’s\r\nabsolutely scientific. It’s verifiable. Well, and apply it! You buy in\r\nthe hollow and sell on the crest, and there you are!”\r\n\r\nI was so convinced of the triviality of this amusement that to find at\r\nlast that he had taken it in the most disastrous earnest overwhelmed\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe took me for a long walk to break it to me, over the hills towards\r\nYare and across the great gorse commons by Hazelbrow.\r\n\r\n“There are ups and downs in life, George,” he said—halfway across that\r\ngreat open space, and paused against the sky.... “I left out one factor\r\nin the Union Pacific analysis.”\r\n\r\n“_Did_ you?” I said, struck by the sudden chance in his voice. “But you\r\ndon’t mean?”\r\n\r\nI stopped and turned on him in the narrow sandy rut of pathway and he\r\nstopped likewise.\r\n\r\n“I do, George. I _do_ mean. It’s bust me! I’m a bankrupt here and now.”\r\n\r\n“Then—?”\r\n\r\n“The shop’s bust too. I shall have to get out of that.”\r\n\r\n“And me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you!—_you’re_ all right. You can transfer your apprenticeship,\r\nand—er—well, I’m not the sort of man to be careless with trust funds,\r\nyou can be sure. I kept that aspect in mind. There’s some of it left\r\nGeorge—trust me!—quite a decent little sum.”\r\n\r\n“But you and aunt?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t _quite_ the way we meant to leave Wimblehurst, George; but we\r\nshall have to go. Sale; all the things shoved about and ticketed—lot a\r\nhundred and one. Ugh!... It’s been a larky little house in some ways.\r\nThe first we had. Furnishing—a spree in its way.... Very happy...” His\r\nface winced at some memory. “Let’s go on, George,” he said shortly,\r\nnear choking, I could see.\r\n\r\nI turned my back on him, and did not look round again for a little\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n“That’s how it is, you see, George.” I heard him after a time.\r\n\r\nWhen we were back in the high road again he came alongside, and for a\r\ntime we walked in silence.\r\n\r\n“Don’t say anything home yet,” he said presently. “Fortunes of War. I\r\ngot to pick the proper time with Susan—else she’ll get depressed. Not\r\nthat she isn’t a first-rate brick whatever comes along.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” I said, “I’ll be careful”; and it seemed to me for the\r\ntime altogether too selfish to bother him with any further inquiries\r\nabout his responsibility as my trustee. He gave a little sigh of relief\r\nat my note of assent, and was presently talking quite cheerfully of his\r\nplans.... But he had, I remember, one lapse into moodiness that came\r\nand went suddenly. “Those others!” he said, as though the thought had\r\nstung him for the first time.\r\n\r\n“What others?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Damn them!” said he.\r\n\r\n“But what others?”\r\n\r\n“All those damned stick-in-the-mud-and-die-slowly tradespeople: Ruck,\r\nthe butcher, Marbel, the grocer. Snape! Gord! George, _how_ they’ll\r\ngrin!”\r\n\r\nI thought him over in the next few weeks, and I remember now in great\r\ndetail the last talk we had together before he handed over the shop and\r\nme to his successor. For he had the good luck to sell his business,\r\n“lock, stock, and barrel”—in which expression I found myself and my\r\nindentures included. The horrors of a sale by auction of the furniture\r\neven were avoided.\r\n\r\nI remember that either coming or going on that occasion, Ruck, the\r\nbutcher, stood in his doorway and regarded us with a grin that showed\r\nhis long teeth.\r\n\r\n“You half-witted hog!” said my uncle. “You grinning hyaena”; and then,\r\n“Pleasant day, Mr. Ruck.”\r\n\r\n“Goin’ to make your fortun’ in London, then?” said Mr. Ruck, with slow\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nThat last excursion took us along the causeway to Beeching, and so up\r\nthe downs and round almost as far as Steadhurst, home. My moods, as we\r\nwent, made a mingled web. By this time I had really grasped the fact\r\nthat my uncle had, in plain English, robbed me; the little\r\naccumulations of my mother, six hundred pounds and more, that would\r\nhave educated me and started me in business, had been eaten into and\r\nwas mostly gone into the unexpected hollow that ought to have been a\r\ncrest of the Union Pacific curve, and of the remainder he still gave no\r\naccount. I was too young and inexperienced to insist on this or know\r\nhow to get it, but the thought of it all made streaks of decidedly\r\nblack anger in that scheme of interwoven feelings. And you know, I was\r\nalso acutely sorry for him—almost as sorry as I was for my aunt Susan.\r\nEven then I had quite found him out. I knew him to be weaker than\r\nmyself; his incurable, irresponsible childishness was as clear to me\r\nthen as it was on his deathbed, his redeeming and excusing imaginative\r\nsilliness. Through some odd mental twist perhaps I was disposed to\r\nexonerate him even at the cost of blaming my poor old mother who had\r\nleft things in his untrustworthy hands.\r\n\r\nI should have forgiven him altogether, I believe, if he had been in any\r\nmanner apologetic to me; but he wasn’t that. He kept reassuring me in a\r\nway I found irritating. Mostly, however, his solicitude was for Aunt\r\nSusan and himself.\r\n\r\n“It’s these Crises, George,” he said, “try Character. Your aunt’s come\r\nout well, my boy.”\r\n\r\nHe made meditative noises for a space.\r\n\r\n“Had her cry of course,”—the thing had been only too painfully evident\r\nto me in her eyes and swollen face—“who wouldn’t? But now—buoyant\r\nagain!... She’s a Corker.\r\n\r\n“We’ll be sorry to leave the little house of course. It’s a bit like\r\nAdam and Eve, you know. Lord! what a chap old Milton was!\r\n\r\n“‘The world was all before them, where to choose\r\nTheir place of rest, and Providence their guide.’\r\n\r\n\r\n“It sounds, George.... Providence their guide!... Well—thank goodness\r\nthere’s no imeedgit prospect of either Cain or Abel!”\r\n\r\n“After all, it won’t be so bad up there. Not the scenery, perhaps, or\r\nthe air we get here, but—_Life!_ We’ve got very comfortable little\r\nrooms, very comfortable considering, and I shall rise. We’re not done\r\nyet, we’re not beaten; don’t think that, George. I shall pay twenty\r\nshillings in the pound before I’ve done—you mark my words,\r\nGeorge,—twenty—five to you.... I got this situation within twenty-four\r\nhours—others offered. It’s an important firm—one of the best in London.\r\nI looked to that. I might have got four or five shillings a week\r\nmore—elsewhere. Quarters I could name. But I said to them plainly,\r\nwages to go on with, but opportunity’s my game—development. We\r\nunderstood each other.”\r\n\r\nHe threw out his chest, and the little round eyes behind his glasses\r\nrested valiantly on imaginary employers.\r\n\r\nWe would go on in silence for a space while he revised and restated\r\nthat encounter. Then he would break out abruptly with some banal\r\nphrase.\r\n\r\n“The Battle of Life, George, my boy,” he would cry, or “Ups and Downs!”\r\n\r\nHe ignored or waived the poor little attempts I made to ascertain my\r\nown position. “That’s all right,” he would say; or, “Leave all that to\r\nme. _I’ll_ look after them.” And he would drift away towards the\r\nphilosophy and moral of the situation. What was I to do?\r\n\r\n“Never put all your resources into one chance, George; that’s the\r\nlesson I draw from this. Have forces in reserve. It was a hundred to\r\none, George, that I was right—a hundred to one. I worked it out\r\nafterwards. And here we are spiked on the off-chance. If I’d have only\r\nkept back a little, I’d have had it on U.P. next day, like a shot, and\r\ncome out on the rise. There you are!”\r\n\r\nHis thoughts took a graver turn.\r\n\r\n“It’s where you’ll bump up against Chance like this, George, that you\r\nfeel the need of religion. Your hard-and-fast scientific men—your\r\nSpencers and Huxleys—they don’t understand that. I do. I’ve thought of\r\nit a lot lately—in bed and about. I was thinking of it this morning\r\nwhile I shaved. It’s not irreverent for me to say it, I hope—but God\r\ncomes in on the off-chance, George. See? Don’t you be too cocksure of\r\nanything, good or bad. That’s what I make out of it. I could have\r\nsworn. Well, do you think I—particular as I am—would have touched those\r\nUnion Pacifics with trust money at all, if I hadn’t thought it a\r\nthoroughly good thing—good without spot or blemish?... And it was bad!\r\n\r\n“It’s a lesson to me. You start in to get a hundred percent. and you\r\ncome out with that. It means, in a way, a reproof for Pride. I’ve\r\nthought of that, George—in the Night Watches. I was thinking this\r\nmorning when I was shaving, that that’s where the good of it all comes\r\nin. At the bottom I’m a mystic in these affairs. You calculate you’re\r\ngoing to do this or that, but at bottom who knows at all _what_ he’s\r\ndoing? When you most think you’re doing things, they’re being done\r\nright over your head. _You’re_ being done—in a sense. Take a hundred-to\r\none chance, or one to a hundred—what does it matter? You’re being Led.”\r\n\r\nIt’s odd that I heard this at the time with unutterable contempt, and\r\nnow that I recall it—well, I ask myself, what have I got better?\r\n\r\n“I wish,” said I, becoming for a moment outrageous, “_you_ were being\r\nLed to give me some account of my money, uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Not without a bit of paper to figure on, George, I can’t. But you\r\ntrust me about that never fear. You trust me.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the end I had to.\r\n\r\nI think the bankruptcy hit my aunt pretty hard. There was, so far as I\r\ncan remember now, a complete cessation of all those cheerful outbreaks\r\nof elasticity, no more skylarking in the shop nor scampering about the\r\nhouse. But there was no fuss that I saw, and only little signs in her\r\ncomplexion of the fits of weeping that must have taken her. She didn’t\r\ncry at the end, though to me her face with its strain of\r\nself-possession was more pathetic than any weeping. “Well” she said to\r\nme as she came through the shop to the cab, “Here’s old orf, George!\r\nOrf to Mome number two! Good-bye!” And she took me in her arms and\r\nkissed me and pressed me to her. Then she dived straight for the cab\r\nbefore I could answer her.\r\n\r\nMy uncle followed, and he seemed to me a trifle too valiant and\r\nconfident in his bearing for reality. He was unusually white in the\r\nface. He spoke to his successor at the counter. “Here we go!” he said.\r\n“One down, the other up. You’ll find it a quiet little business so long\r\nas you run it on quiet lines—a nice quiet little business. There’s\r\nnothing more? No? Well, if you want to know anything write to me. I’ll\r\nalways explain fully. Anything—business, place or people. You’ll find\r\nPil Antibil. a little overstocked by-the-by, I found it soothed my mind\r\nthe day before yesterday making ’em, and I made ’em all day. Thousands!\r\nAnd where’s George? Ah! there you are! I’ll write to you, George,\r\n_fully_, about all that affair. Fully!”\r\n\r\nIt became clear to me as if for the first time, that I was really\r\nparting from my aunt Susan. I went out on to the pavement and saw her\r\nhead craned forward, her wide-open blue eyes and her little face intent\r\non the shop that had combined for her all the charms of a big doll’s\r\nhouse and a little home of her very own. “Good-bye!” she said to it and\r\nto me. Our eyes met for a moment—perplexed. My uncle bustled out and\r\ngave a few totally unnecessary directions to the cabman and got in\r\nbeside her. “All right?” asked the driver. “Right,” said I; and he woke\r\nup the horse with a flick of his whip. My aunt’s eyes surveyed me\r\nagain. “Stick to your old science and things, George, and write and\r\ntell me when they make you a Professor,” she said cheerfully.\r\n\r\nShe stared at me for a second longer with eyes growing wider and\r\nbrighter and a smile that had become fixed, glanced again at the bright\r\nlittle shop still saying “Ponderevo” with all the emphasis of its\r\nfascia, and then flopped back hastily out of sight of me into the\r\nrecesses of the cab. Then it had gone from before me and I beheld Mr.\r\nSnape, the hairdresser, inside his store regarding its departure with a\r\nquiet satisfaction and exchanging smiles and significant headshakes\r\nwith Mr. Marbel.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI was left, I say, as part of the lock, stock, and barrel, at\r\nWimblehurst with my new master, a Mr. Mantell; who plays no part in the\r\nprogress of this story except in so far as he effaced my uncle’s\r\ntraces. So soon as the freshness of this new personality faded, I began\r\nto find Wimblehurst not only a dull but a lonely place, and to miss my\r\naunt Susan immensely. The advertisements of the summer terms for Cough\r\nLinctus were removed; the bottles of coloured water—red, green, and\r\nyellow—restored to their places; the horse announcing veterinary\r\nmedicine, which my uncle, sizzling all the while, had coloured in\r\ncareful portraiture of a Goodwood favourite, rewhitened; and I turned\r\nmyself even more resolutely than before to Latin (until the passing of\r\nmy preliminary examination enabled me to drop that), and then to\r\nmathematics and science.\r\n\r\nThere were classes in Electricity and Magnetism at the Grammar School.\r\nI took a little “elementary” prize in that in my first year and a medal\r\nin my third; and in Chemistry and Human Physiology and Sound, Light and\r\nHeat, I did well. There was also a lighter, more discursive subject\r\ncalled Physiography, in which one ranged among the sciences and\r\nencountered Geology as a process of evolution from Eozoon to Eastry\r\nHouse, and Astronomy as a record of celestial movements of the most\r\naustere and invariable integrity. I learnt out of badly-written,\r\ncondensed little text-books, and with the minimum of experiment, but\r\nstill I learnt. Only thirty years ago it was, and I remember I learnt\r\nof the electric light as an expensive, impracticable toy, the telephone\r\nas a curiosity, electric traction as a practical absurdity. There was\r\nno argon, no radium, no phagocytes—at least to my knowledge, and\r\naluminium was a dear, infrequent metal. The fastest ships in the world\r\nwent then at nineteen knots, and no one but a lunatic here and there\r\never thought it possible that men might fly.\r\n\r\nMany things have happened since then, but the last glance I had of\r\nWimblehurst two years ago remarked no change whatever in its pleasant\r\ntranquillity. They had not even built any fresh houses—at least not\r\nactually in the town, though about the station there had been some\r\nbuilding. But it was a good place to do work in, for all its\r\nquiescence. I was soon beyond the small requirements of the\r\nPharmaceutical Society’s examination, and as they do not permit\r\ncandidates to sit for that until one and twenty, I was presently\r\nfilling up my time and preventing my studies becoming too desultory by\r\nmaking an attack upon the London University degree of Bachelor of\r\nScience, which impressed me then as a very splendid but almost\r\nimpossible achievement. The degree in mathematics and chemistry\r\nappealed to me as particularly congenial—albeit giddily inaccessible. I\r\nset to work. I had presently to arrange a holiday and go to London to\r\nmatriculate, and so it was I came upon my aunt and uncle again. In many\r\nways that visit marked an epoch. It was my first impression of London\r\nat all. I was then nineteen, and by a conspiracy of chances my nearest\r\napproach to that human wilderness had been my brief visit to Chatham.\r\nChatham too had been my largest town. So that I got London at last with\r\nan exceptional freshness of effect, as the sudden revelation of a whole\r\nunsuspected other side to life.\r\n\r\nI came to it on a dull and smoky day by the South Eastern Railway, and\r\nour train was half an hour late, stopping and going on and stopping\r\nagain. I marked beyond Chiselhurst the growing multitude of villas, and\r\nso came stage by stage through multiplying houses and diminishing\r\ninterspaces of market garden and dingy grass to regions of interlacing\r\nrailway lines, big factories, gasometers and wide reeking swamps of\r\ndingy little homes, more of them and more and more. The number of these\r\nand their dinginess and poverty increased, and here rose a great public\r\nhouse and here a Board School and there a gaunt factory; and away to\r\nthe east there loomed for a time a queer, incongruous forest of masts\r\nand spars. The congestion of houses intensified and piled up presently\r\ninto tenements; I marveled more and more at this boundless world of\r\ndingy people; whiffs of industrial smell, of leather, of brewing,\r\ndrifted into the carriage; the sky darkened, I rumbled thunderously\r\nover bridges, van-crowded streets, peered down on and crossed the\r\nThames with an abrupt eclat of sound. I got an effect of tall\r\nwarehouses, of grey water, barge crowded, of broad banks of\r\nindescribable mud, and then I was in Cannon Street Station—a monstrous\r\ndirty cavern with trains packed across its vast floor and more porters\r\nstanding along the platform than I had ever been in my life before. I\r\nalighted with my portmanteau and struggled along, realising for the\r\nfirst time just how small and weak I could still upon occasion feel. In\r\nthis world, I felt, an Honours medal in Electricity and magnetism\r\ncounted for nothing at all.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I drove in a cab down a canon of rushing street between high\r\nwarehouses, and peeped up astonished at the blackened greys of Saint\r\nPaul’s. The traffic of Cheapside—it was mostly in horse omnibuses in\r\nthose days—seemed stupendous, its roar was stupendous; I wondered where\r\nthe money came from to employ so many cabs, what industry could support\r\nthe endless jostling stream of silk-hatted, frock-coated, hurrying men.\r\nDown a turning I found the Temperance Hotel Mr. Mantell had recommended\r\nto me. The porter in a green uniform who took over my portmanteau,\r\nseemed, I thought, to despise me a good deal.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMatriculation kept me for four full days and then came an afternoon to\r\nspare, and I sought out Tottenham Court Road through a perplexing\r\nnetwork of various and crowded streets. But this London was vast! it\r\nwas endless! it seemed the whole world had changed into packed\r\nfrontages and hoardings and street spaces. I got there at last and made\r\ninquiries, and I found my uncle behind the counter of the pharmacy he\r\nmanaged, an establishment that did not impress me as doing a\r\nparticularly high-class trade. “Lord!” he said at the sight of me, “I\r\nwas wanting something to happen!”\r\n\r\nHe greeted me warmly. I had grown taller, and he, I thought, had grown\r\nshorter and smaller and rounder but otherwise he was unchanged. He\r\nstruck me as being rather shabby, and the silk hat he produced and put\r\non, when, after mysterious negotiations in the back premises he\r\nachieved his freedom to accompany me, was past its first youth; but he\r\nwas as buoyant and confident as ever.\r\n\r\n“Come to ask me about all _that_,” he cried. “I’ve never written yet.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, among other things,” said I, with a sudden regrettable politeness,\r\nand waived the topic of his trusteeship to ask after my aunt Susan.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have her out of it,” he said suddenly; “we’ll go somewhere. We\r\ndon’t get you in London every day.”\r\n\r\n“It’s my first visit,” I said, “I’ve never seen London before”; and\r\nthat made him ask me what I thought of it, and the rest of the talk was\r\nLondon, London, to the exclusion of all smaller topics. He took me up\r\nthe Hampstead Road almost to the Cobden statue, plunged into some back\r\nstreets to the left, and came at last to a blistered front door that\r\nresponded to his latch-key, one of a long series of blistered front\r\ndoors with fanlights and apartment cards above. We found ourselves in a\r\ndrab-coloured passage that was not only narrow and dirty but\r\ndesolatingly empty, and then he opened a door and revealed my aunt\r\nsitting at the window with a little sewing-machine on a bamboo\r\noccasional table before her, and “work”—a plum-coloured walking dress I\r\njudged at its most analytical stage—scattered over the rest of the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance I judged my aunt was plumper than she had been, but\r\nher complexion was just as fresh and her China blue eye as bright as in\r\nthe old days.\r\n\r\n“London,” she said, didn’t “get blacks” on her.\r\n\r\nShe still “cheeked” my uncle, I was pleased to find. “What are you old\r\nPoking in for at _this_ time—_Gubbitt?_” she said when he appeared, and\r\nshe still looked with a practised eye for the facetious side of things.\r\nWhen she saw me behind him, she gave a little cry and stood up radiant.\r\nThen she became grave.\r\n\r\nI was surprised at my own emotion in seeing her. She held me at arm’s\r\nlength for a moment, a hand on each shoulder, and looked at me with a\r\nsort of glad scrutiny. She seemed to hesitate, and then pecked little\r\nkiss off my cheek.\r\n\r\n“You’re a man, George,” she said, as she released me, and continued to\r\nlook at me for a while.\r\n\r\nTheir _ménage_ was one of a very common type in London. They occupied\r\nwhat is called the dining-room floor of a small house, and they had the\r\nuse of a little inconvenient kitchen in the basement that had once been\r\nscullery. The two rooms, bedroom behind and living room in front, were\r\nseparated by folding-doors that were never now thrown back, and indeed,\r\nin the presence of a visitor, not used at all. There was of course no\r\nbathroom or anything of that sort available, and there was no water\r\nsupply except to the kitchen below. My aunt did all the domestic work,\r\nthough she could have afforded to pay for help if the build of the\r\nplace had not rendered that inconvenient to the pitch of impossibility.\r\nThere was no sort of help available except that of indoor servants, for\r\nwhom she had no accommodation. The furniture was their own; it was\r\npartly secondhand, but on the whole it seemed cheerful to my eye, and\r\nmy aunt’s bias for cheap, gay-figured muslin had found ample score. In\r\nmany ways I should think it must have been an extremely inconvenient\r\nand cramped sort of home, but at the time I took it, as I was taking\r\neverything, as being there and in the nature of things. I did not see\r\nthe oddness of solvent decent people living in a habitation so clearly\r\nneither designed nor adapted for their needs, so wasteful of labour and\r\nso devoid of beauty as this was, and it is only now as I describe this\r\nthat I find myself thinking of the essential absurdity of an\r\nintelligent community living in such makeshift homes. It strikes me now\r\nas the next thing to wearing second-hand clothes.\r\n\r\nYou see it was a natural growth, part of that system to which\r\nBladesover, I hold, is the key. There are wide regions of London, miles\r\nof streets of houses, that appear to have been originally designed for\r\nprosperous-middle-class homes of the early Victorian type. There must\r\nhave been a perfect fury of such building in the thirties, forties, and\r\nfifties. Street after street must have been rushed into being, Campden\r\nTown way, Pentonville way, Brompton way, West Kensington way in the\r\nVictoria region and all over the minor suburbs of the south side.\r\n\r\nI am doubtful if many of these houses had any long use as the\r\nresidences of single families if from the very first almost their\r\ntenants did not makeshift and take lodgers and sublet. They were built\r\nwith basements, in which their servants worked and lived—servants of a\r\nmore submissive and troglodytic generation who did not mind stairs. The\r\ndining-room (with folding doors) was a little above the ground level,\r\nand in that the wholesome boiled and roast with damp boiled potatoes\r\nand then pie to follow, was consumed and the numerous family read and\r\nworked in the evening, and above was the drawing-room (also with\r\nfolding doors), where the infrequent callers were received. That was\r\nthe vision at which those industrious builders aimed. Even while these\r\nhouses were being run up, the threads upon the loom of fate were\r\nshaping to abolish altogether the type of household that would have\r\nfitted them. Means of transit were developing to carry the moderately\r\nprosperous middle-class families out of London, education and factory\r\nemployment were whittling away at the supply of rough, hardworking,\r\nobedient girls who would stand the subterranean drudgery of these\r\nplaces, new classes of hard-up middle-class people such as my uncle,\r\nemployees of various types, were coming into existence, for whom no\r\nhomes were provided. None of these classes have ideas of what they\r\nought to be, or fit in any legitimate way into the Bladesover theory\r\nthat dominates our minds. It was nobody’s concern to see them housed\r\nunder civilised conditions, and the beautiful laws of supply and demand\r\nhad free play. They had to squeeze in. The landlords came out\r\nfinancially intact from their blundering enterprise. More and more\r\nthese houses fell into the hands of married artisans, or struggling\r\nwidows or old servants with savings, who became responsible for the\r\nquarterly rent and tried to sweat a living by sub-letting furnished or\r\nunfurnished apartments.\r\n\r\nI remember now that a poor grey-haired old woman who had an air of\r\nhaving been roused from a nap in the dust bin, came out into the area\r\nand looked up at us as we three went out from the front door to “see\r\nLondon” under my uncle’s direction. She was the sub-letting occupier;\r\nshe squeezed out a precarious living by taking the house whole and\r\nsub-letting it in detail and she made her food and got the shelter of\r\nan attic above and a basement below by the transaction. And if she\r\ndidn’t chance to “let” steadily, out she went to pauperdom and some\r\nother poor, sordid old adventurer tried in her place....\r\n\r\nIt is a foolish community that can house whole classes, useful and\r\nhelpful, honest and loyal classes, in such squalidly unsuitable\r\ndwellings. It is by no means the social economy it seems, to use up old\r\nwomen, savings and inexperience in order to meet the landlord’s\r\ndemands. But any one who doubts this thing is going on right up to\r\nto-day need only spend an afternoon in hunting for lodgings in any of\r\nthe regions of London I have named.\r\n\r\nBut where has my story got to? My uncle, I say, decided I must be shown\r\nLondon, and out we three went as soon as my aunt had got her hat on, to\r\ncatch all that was left of the day.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt pleased my uncle extremely to find I had never seen London before.\r\nHe took possession of the metropolis forthwith. “London, George,” he\r\nsaid, “takes a lot of understanding. It’s a great place. Immense. The\r\nrichest town in the world, the biggest port, the greatest manufacturing\r\ntown, the Imperial city—the centre of civilisation, the heart of the\r\nworld! See those sandwich men down there! That third one’s hat! Fair\r\ntreat! You don’t see poverty like that in Wimblehurst George! And many\r\nof them high Oxford honour men too. Brought down by drink! It’s a\r\nwonderful place, George—a whirlpool, a maelstrom! whirls you up and\r\nwhirls you down.”\r\n\r\nI have a very confused memory of that afternoon’s inspection of London.\r\nMy uncle took us to and fro showing us over his London, talking\r\nerratically, following a route of his own. Sometimes we were walking,\r\nsometimes we were on the tops of great staggering horse omnibuses in a\r\nheaving jumble of traffic, and at one point we had tea in an Aerated\r\nBread Shop. But I remember very distinctly how we passed down Park Lane\r\nunder an overcast sky, and how my uncle pointed out the house of this\r\nchild of good fortune and that with succulent appreciation.\r\n\r\nI remember, too, that as he talked I would find my aunt watching my\r\nface as if to check the soundness of his talk by my expression.\r\n\r\n“Been in love yet, George?” she asked suddenly, over a bun in the\r\ntea-shop.\r\n\r\n“Too busy, aunt,” I told her.\r\n\r\nShe bit her bun extensively, and gesticulated with the remnant to\r\nindicate that she had more to say.\r\n\r\n“How are _you_ going to make your fortune?” she said so soon as she\r\ncould speak again. “You haven’t told us that.”\r\n\r\n“’Lectricity,” said my uncle, taking breath after a deep draught of\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n“If I make it at all,” I said. “For my part I think shall be satisfied\r\nwith something less than a fortune.”\r\n\r\n“We’re going to make ours—suddenly,” she said.\r\n\r\n“So _he_ old says.” She jerked her head at my uncle.\r\n\r\n“He won’t tell me when—so I can’t get anything ready. But it’s coming.\r\nGoing to ride in our carriage and have a garden. Garden—like a\r\nbishop’s.”\r\n\r\nShe finished her bun and twiddled crumbs from her fingers. “I shall be\r\nglad of the garden,” she said. “It’s going to be a real big one with\r\nrosaries and things. Fountains in it. Pampas grass. Hothouses.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll get it all right,” said my uncle, who had reddened a little.\r\n\r\n“Grey horses in the carriage, George,” she said. “It’s nice to think\r\nabout when one’s dull. And dinners in restaurants often and often. And\r\ntheatres—in the stalls. And money and money and money.”\r\n\r\n“You may joke,” said my uncle, and hummed for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Just as though an old Porpoise like him would ever make money,” she\r\nsaid, turning her eyes upon his profile with a sudden lapse to\r\naffection. “He’ll just porpoise about.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do something,” said my uncle, “you bet! Zzzz!” and rapped with a\r\nshilling on the marble table.\r\n\r\n“When you do you’ll have to buy me a new pair of gloves,” she said,\r\n“anyhow. That finger’s past mending. Look! you Cabbage—you.” And she\r\nheld the split under his nose, and pulled a face of comical fierceness.\r\n\r\nMy uncle smiled at these sallies at the time, but afterwards, when I\r\nwent back with him to the Pharmacy—the low-class business grew brisker\r\nin the evening and they kept open late—he reverted to it in a low\r\nexpository tone. “Your aunt’s a bit impatient, George. She gets at me.\r\nIt’s only natural.... A woman doesn’t understand how long it takes to\r\nbuild up a position. No.... In certain directions now—I\r\nam—quietly—building up a position. Now here.... I get this room. I have\r\nmy three assistants. Zzzz. It’s a position that, judged by the\r\ncriterion of imeedjit income, isn’t perhaps so good as I deserve, but\r\nstrategically—yes. It’s what I want. I make my plans. I rally my\r\nattack.”\r\n\r\n“What plans,” I said, “are you making?”\r\n\r\n“Well, George, there’s one thing you can rely upon, I’m doing nothing\r\nin a hurry. I turn over this one and that, and I don’t\r\ntalk—indiscreetly. There’s—No! I don’t think I can tell you that. And\r\nyet, why NOT?”\r\n\r\nHe got up and closed the door into the shop. “I’ve told no one,” he\r\nremarked, as he sat down again. “I owe you something.”\r\n\r\nHis face flushed slightly, he leant forward over the little table\r\ntowards me.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” he said.\r\n\r\nI listened.\r\n\r\n“Tono-Bungay,” said my uncle very slowly and distinctly.\r\n\r\nI thought he was asking me to hear some remote, strange noise. “I don’t\r\nhear anything,” I said reluctantly to his expectant face. He smiled\r\nundefeated. “Try again,” he said, and repeated, “Tono-Bungay.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _that!_” I said.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said he.\r\n\r\n“But what is it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said my uncle, rejoicing and expanding. “What _is_ it? That’s\r\nwhat you got to ask? What _won’t_ it be?” He dug me violently in what\r\nhe supposed to be my ribs. “George,” he cried—“George, watch this\r\nplace! There’s more to follow.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was all I could get from him.\r\n\r\nThat, I believe, was the very first time that the words Tono-Bungay\r\never heard on earth—unless my uncle indulged in monologues in his\r\nchamber—a highly probable thing. Its utterance certainly did not seem\r\nto me at the time to mark any sort of epoch, and had I been told this\r\nword was the Open Sesame to whatever pride and pleasure the grimy front\r\nof London hid from us that evening, I should have laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n“Coming now to business,” I said after a pause, and with a chill sense\r\nof effort; and I opened the question of his trust.\r\n\r\nMy uncle sighed, and leant back in his chair. “I wish I could make all\r\nthis business as clear to you as it is to me,” he said. “However—Go on!\r\nSay what you have to say.”\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAfter I left my uncle that evening I gave way to a feeling of profound\r\ndepression. My uncle and aunt seemed to me to be leading—I have already\r\nused the word too often, but I must use it again—_dingy_ lives. They\r\nseemed to be adrift in a limitless crowd of dingy people, wearing\r\nshabby clothes, living uncomfortably in shabby second-hand houses,\r\ngoing to and fro on pavements that had always a thin veneer of greasy,\r\nslippery mud, under grey skies that showed no gleam of hope of anything\r\nfor them but dinginess until they died. It seemed absolutely clear to\r\nme that my mother’s little savings had been swallowed up and that my\r\nown prospect was all too certainly to drop into and be swallowed up\r\nmyself sooner or later by this dingy London ocean. The London that was\r\nto be an adventurous escape from the slumber of Wimblehurst, had\r\nvanished from my dreams. I saw my uncle pointing to the houses in Park\r\nLane and showing a frayed shirt-cuff as he did so. I heard my aunt:\r\n“I’m to ride in my carriage then. So he old says.”\r\n\r\nMy feelings towards my uncle were extraordinarily mixed. I was\r\nintensely sorry not only for my aunt Susan but for him—for it seemed\r\nindisputable that as they were living then so they must go on—and at\r\nthe same time I was angry with the garrulous vanity and illness that\r\nhad elipped all my chance of independent study, and imprisoned her in\r\nthose grey apartments. When I got back to Wimblehurst I allowed myself\r\nto write him a boyishly sarcastic and sincerely bitter letter. He never\r\nreplied. Then, believing it to be the only way of escape for me, I set\r\nmyself far more grimly and resolutely to my studies than I had ever\r\ndone before. After a time I wrote to him in more moderate terms, and he\r\nanswered me evasively. And then I tried to dismiss him from my mind and\r\nwent on working.\r\n\r\nYes, that first raid upon London under the moist and chilly depression\r\nof January had an immense effect upon me. It was for me an epoch-making\r\ndisappointment. I had thought of London as a large, free, welcoming,\r\nadventurous place, and I saw it slovenly and harsh and irresponsive.\r\n\r\nI did not realise at all what human things might be found behind those\r\ngrey frontages, what weakness that whole forbidding façade might\r\npresently confess. It is the constant error of youth to over-estimate\r\nthe Will in things. I did not see that the dirt, the discouragement,\r\nthe discomfort of London could be due simply to the fact that London\r\nwas a witless old giantess of a town, too slack and stupid to keep\r\nherself clean and maintain a brave face to the word. No! I suffered\r\nfrom the sort of illusion that burnt witches in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. I endued her grubby disorder with a sinister and magnificent\r\nquality of intention.\r\n\r\nAnd my uncle’s gestures and promises filled me with doubt and a sort of\r\nfear for him. He seemed to me a lost little creature, too silly to be\r\nsilent, in a vast implacable condemnation. I was full of pity and a\r\nsort of tenderness for my aunt Susan, who was doomed to follow his\r\nerratic fortunes mocked by his grandiloquent promises.\r\n\r\nI was to learn better. But I worked with the terror of the grim\r\nunderside of London in my soul during all my last year at Wimblehurst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND\r\nTHE RISE OF TONO-BUNGAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST\r\nHOW I BECAME A LONDON STUDENT AND WENT ASTRAY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI came to live in London, as I shall tell you, when I was nearly\r\ntwenty-two. Wimblehurst dwindles in perspective, is now in this book a\r\nlittle place far off, Bladesover no more than a small pinkish speck of\r\nfrontage among the distant Kentish hills; the scene broadens out,\r\nbecomes multitudinous and limitless, full of the sense of vast\r\nirrelevant movement. I do not remember my second coming to London as I\r\ndo my first, for my early impressions, save that an October memory of\r\nsoftened amber sunshine stands out, amber sunshine falling on grey\r\nhouse fronts I know not where. That, and a sense of a large\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nI could fill a book, I think, with a more or less imaginary account of\r\nhow I came to apprehend London, how first in one aspect and then in\r\nanother it grew in my mind. Each day my accumulating impressions were\r\nadded to and qualified and brought into relationship with new ones;\r\nthey fused inseparably with others that were purely personal and\r\naccidental. I find myself with a certain comprehensive perception of\r\nLondon, complete indeed, incurably indistinct in places and yet in some\r\nway a whole that began with my first visit and is still being mellowed\r\nand enriched.\r\n\r\nLondon!\r\n\r\nAt first, no doubt, it was a chaos of streets and people and buildings\r\nand reasonless going to and fro. I do not remember that I ever\r\nstruggled very steadily to understand it, or explored it with any but a\r\npersonal and adventurous intention. Yet in time there has grown up in\r\nme a kind of theory of London; I do think I see lines of an ordered\r\nstructure out of which it has grown, detected a process that is\r\nsomething more than a confusion of casual accidents though indeed it\r\nmay be no more than a process of disease.\r\n\r\nI said at the outset of my first book that I find in Bladesover the\r\nclue to all England. Well, I certainly imagine it is the clue to the\r\nstructure of London. There have been no revolutions no deliberate\r\nrestatements or abandonments of opinion in England since the days of\r\nthe fine gentry, since 1688 or thereabouts, the days when Bladesover\r\nwas built; there have been changes, dissolving forest replacing forest,\r\nif you will; but then it was that the broad lines of the English system\r\nset firmly. And as I have gone to and fro in London in certain regions\r\nconstantly the thought has recurred this is Bladesover House, this\r\nanswers to Bladesover House. The fine gentry may have gone; they have\r\nindeed largely gone, I think; rich merchants may have replaced them,\r\nfinancial adventurers or what not. That does not matter; the shape is\r\nstill Bladesover.\r\n\r\nI am most reminded of Bladesover and Eastry by all those regions round\r\nabout the West End parks; for example, estate parks, each more or less\r\nin relation to a palace or group of great houses. The roads and back\r\nways of Mayfair and all about St. James’s again, albeit perhaps of a\r\nlater growth in point of time, were of the very spirit and\r\narchitectural texture of the Bladesover passages and yards; they had\r\nthe same smells, the space, the large cleanest and always going to and\r\nfro where one met unmistakable Olympians and even more unmistakable\r\nvalets, butlers, footmen in mufti. There were moments when I seemed to\r\nglimpse down areas the white panelling, the very chintz of my mother’s\r\nroom again.\r\n\r\nI could trace out now on a map what I would call the Great-House\r\nregion; passing south-westward into Belgravia, becoming diffused and\r\nsporadic westward, finding its last systematic outbreak round and about\r\nRegent’s Park. The Duke of Devonshire’s place in Piccadilly, in all its\r\ninsolent ugliness, pleases me particularly; it is the quintessence of\r\nthe thing; Apsley House is all in the manner of my theory, Park Lane\r\nhas its quite typical mansions, and they run along the border of the\r\nGreen Park and St. James’s. And I struck out a truth one day in\r\nCromwell Road quite suddenly, as I looked over the Natural History\r\nMuseum “By Jove,” said I “but this is the little assemblage of cases of\r\nstuffed birds and animals upon the Bladesover staircase grown enormous,\r\nand yonder as the corresponding thing to the Bladesover curios and\r\nporcelain is the Art Museume and there in the little observatories in\r\nExhibition Road is old Sir Cuthbert’s Gregorian telescope that I hunted\r\nout in the storeroom and put together.” And diving into the Art Museum\r\nunder this inspiration, I came to a little reading-room and found as I\r\nhad inferred, old brown books!\r\n\r\nIt was really a good piece of social comparative anatomy I did that\r\nday; all these museums and libraries that are dotted over London\r\nbetween Piccadilly and West Kensington, and indeed the museum and\r\nlibrary movement throughout the world, sprang from the elegant leisure\r\nof the gentlemen of taste. Theirs were the first libraries, the first\r\nhouses of culture; by my rat-like raids into the Bladesover saloon I\r\nbecame, as it were, the last dwindled representative of such a man of\r\nletters as Swift. But now these things have escaped out of the Great\r\nHouse altogether, and taken on a strange independent life of their own.\r\n\r\nIt is this idea of escaping parts from the seventeenth century system\r\nof Bladesover, of proliferating and overgrowing elements from the\r\nEstates, that to this day seems to me the best explanation, not simply\r\nof London, but of all England. England is a country of great Renascence\r\nlanded gentlefolk who have been unconsciously outgrown and overgrown.\r\nThe proper shops for Bladesover custom were still to be found in Regent\r\nStreet and Bond Street in my early London days in those days they had\r\nbeen but lightly touched by the American’s profaning hand—and in\r\nPiccadilly. I found the doctor’s house of the country village or\r\ncountry town up and down Harley Street, multiplied but not otherwise\r\ndifferent, and the family solicitor (by the hundred) further eastward\r\nin the abandoned houses of a previous generation of gentlepeople, and\r\ndown in Westminster, behind Palladian fronts, the public offices\r\nsheltered in large Bladesoverish rooms and looked out on St. James’s\r\nPark. The Parliament Houses of lords and gentlemen, the parliament\r\nhouse that was horrified when merchants and brewers came thrusting into\r\nit a hundred years ago, stood out upon its terrace gathering the whole\r\nsystem together into a head.\r\n\r\nAnd the more I have paralleled these things with my Bladesover-Eastry\r\nmodel, the more evident it has become to me that the balance is not the\r\nsame, and the more evident is the presence of great new forces, blind\r\nforces of invasion, of growth. The railway termini on the north side of\r\nLondon have been kept as remote as Eastry had kept the railway-station\r\nfrom Wimblehurst, they stop on the very outskirts of the estates, but\r\nfrom the south, the South Eastern railway had butted its great stupid\r\nrusty iron head of Charing Cross station, that great head that came\r\nsmashing down in 1905—clean across the river, between Somerset House\r\nand Whitehall. The south side had no protecting estate. Factory\r\nchimneys smoke right over against Westminster with an air of carelessly\r\nnot having permission, and the whole effect of industrial London and of\r\nall London east of Temple Bar and of the huge dingy immensity of London\r\nport is to me of something disproportionately large, something morbidly\r\nexpanded, without plan or intention, dark and sinister toward the clean\r\nclear social assurance of the West End. And south of this central\r\nLondon, south-east, south-west, far west, north-west, all round the\r\nnorthern hills, are similar disproportionate growths, endless streets\r\nof undistinguished houses, undistinguished industries, shabby families,\r\nsecond-rate shops, inexplicable people who in a once fashionable phrase\r\ndo not “exist.” All these aspects have suggested to my mind at times,\r\ndo suggest to this day, the unorganised, abundant substance of some\r\ntumorous growth-process, a process which indeed bursts all the outlines\r\nof the affected carcass and protrudes such masses as ignoble\r\ncomfortable Croydon, as tragic impoverished West Ham. To this day I ask\r\nmyself will those masses ever become structural, will they indeed shape\r\ninto anything new whatever, or is that cancerous image their true and\r\nultimate diagnosis?...\r\n\r\nMoreover, together with this hypertrophy there is an immigration of\r\nelements that have never understood and never will understand the great\r\ntradition, wedges of foreign settlement embedded in the heart of this\r\nyeasty English expansion. One day I remember wandering eastward out of\r\npure curiosity—it must have been in my early student days—and\r\ndiscovering a shabbily bright foreign quarter, shops displaying Hebrew\r\nplacards and weird, unfamiliar commodities and a concourse of\r\nbright-eyed, eagle-nosed people talking some incomprehensible gibberish\r\nbetween the shops and the barrows. And soon I became quite familiar\r\nwith the devious, vicious, dirtily-pleasant eroticism of Soho. I found\r\nthose crowded streets a vast relief from the dull grey exterior of\r\nBrompton where I lodged and lived my daily life. In Soho, indeed, I got\r\nmy first inkling of the factor of replacement that is so important in\r\nboth the English and the American process.\r\n\r\nEven in the West End, in Mayfair and the square, about Pall Mall, Ewart\r\nwas presently to remind me the face of the old aristocratic dignity was\r\nfairer than its substance; here were actors and actresses, here money\r\nlenders and Jews, here bold financial adventurers, and I thought of my\r\nuncle’s frayed cuff as he pointed out this house in Park Lane and that.\r\nThat was so and so’s who made a corner in borax, and that palace\r\nbelonged to that hero among modern adventurers, Barmentrude, who used\r\nto be an I.D.B.,—an illicit diamond buyer that is to say. A city of\r\nBladesovers, the capital of a kingdom of Bladesovers, all much shaken\r\nand many altogether in decay, parasitically occupied, insidiously\r\nreplaced by alien, unsympathetic and irresponsible elements; and with a\r\nruling an adventitious and miscellaneous empire of a quarter of this\r\ndaedal earth complex laws, intricate social necessities, disturbing\r\ninsatiable suggestions, followed from this. Such was the world into\r\nwhich I had come, into which I had in some way to thrust myself and fit\r\nmy problem, my temptations, my efforts, my patriotic instinct, all my\r\nmoral instincts, my physical appetites, my dreams and my sanity.\r\n\r\nLondon! I came up to it, young and without advisers, rather priggish,\r\nrather dangerously open-minded and very open-eyed, and with\r\nsomething—it is, I think, the common gift of imaginative youth, and I\r\nclaim it unblushingly—fine in me, finer than the world and seeking fine\r\nresponses. I did not want simply to live or simply to live happily or\r\nwell; I wanted to serve and do and make—with some nobility. It was in\r\nme. It is in half the youth of the world.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI had come to London as a scholar. I had taken the Vincent Bradley\r\nscholarship of the Pharmaceutical Society, but I threw this up when I\r\nfound that my work of the Science and Art Department in mathematics,\r\nphysics and chemistry had given me one of the minor Technical Board\r\nScholarships at the Consolidated Technical Schools at South Kensington.\r\nThis latter was in mechanics and metallurgy; and I hesitated between\r\nthe two. The Vincent Bradley gave me £70 a year and quite the best\r\nstart-off a pharmaceutical chemist could have; the South Kensington\r\nthing was worth about twenty-two shillings a week, and the prospects it\r\nopened were vague. But it meant far more scientific work than the\r\nformer, and I was still under the impulse of that great intellectual\r\nappetite that is part of the adolescence of men of my type. Moreover it\r\nseemed to lead towards engineering, in which I imagined—I imagine to\r\nthis day—my particular use is to be found. I took its greater\r\nuncertainty as a fair risk. I came up very keen, not doubting that the\r\nreally hard and steady industry that had carried me through Wimblehurst\r\nwould go on still in the new surroundings.\r\n\r\nOnly from the very first it didn’t....\r\n\r\nWhen I look back now at my Wimblehurst days, I still find myself\r\nsurprised at the amount of steady grinding study, of strenuous\r\nself-discipline that I maintained throughout my apprenticeship. In many\r\nways I think that time was the most honourable period in my life. I\r\nwish I could say with a certain mind that my motives in working so well\r\nwere large and honourable too. To a certain extent they were so; there\r\nwas a fine sincere curiosity, a desire for the strength and power of\r\nscientific knowledge and a passion for intellectual exercise; but I do\r\nnot think those forces alone would have kept me at it so grimly and\r\nclosely if Wimblehurst had not been so dull, so limited and so\r\nobservant. Directly I came into the London atmosphere, tasting freedom,\r\ntasting irresponsibility and the pull of new forces altogether, my\r\ndiscipline fell from me like a garment. Wimblehurst to a youngster in\r\nmy position offered no temptations worth counting, no interests to\r\nconflict with study, no vices—such vices as it offered were coarsely\r\nstripped of any imaginative glamourfull drunkenness, clumsy leering\r\nshameful lust, no social intercourse even to waste one’s time, and on\r\nthe other hand it would minister greatly to the self-esteem of a\r\nconspicuously industrious student. One was marked as “clever,” one\r\nplayed up to the part, and one’s little accomplishment stood out finely\r\nin one’s private reckoning against the sunlit small ignorance of that\r\nagreeable place. One went with an intent rush across the market square,\r\none took one’s exercise with as dramatic a sense of an ordered day as\r\nan Oxford don, one burnt the midnight oil quite consciously at the rare\r\nrespectful, benighted passer-by. And one stood out finely in the local\r\npaper with one’s unapproachable yearly harvest of certificates. Thus I\r\nwas not only a genuinely keen student, but also a little of a prig and\r\nposeur in those days—and the latter kept the former at it, as London\r\nmade clear.\r\n\r\nMoreover Wimblehurst had given me no outlet in any other direction.\r\n\r\nBut I did not realise all this when I came to London, did not perceive\r\nhow the change of atmosphere began at once to warp and distribute my\r\nenergies. In the first place I became invisible. If I idled for a day,\r\nno one except my fellow-students (who evidently had no awe for me)\r\nremarked it. No one saw my midnight taper; no one pointed me out as I\r\ncrossed the street as an astonishing intellectual phenomenon. In the\r\nnext place I became inconsiderable. In Wimblehurst I felt I stood for\r\nScience; nobody there seemed to have so much as I and to have it so\r\nfully and completely. In London I walked ignorant in an immensity, and\r\nit was clear that among my fellow-students from the midlands and the\r\nnorth I was ill-equipped and under-trained. With the utmost exertion I\r\nshould only take a secondary position among them. And finally, in the\r\nthird place, I was distracted by voluminous new interests; London took\r\nhold of me, and Science, which had been the universe, shrank back to\r\nthe dimensions of tiresome little formulae compacted in a book. I came\r\nto London in late September, and it was a very different London from\r\nthat great greyly-overcast, smoke-stained house-wilderness of my first\r\nimpressions. I reached it by Victoria and not by Cannon Street, and its\r\ncentre was now in Exhibition Road. It shone, pale amber, blue-grey and\r\ntenderly spacious and fine under clear autumnal skies, a London of\r\nhugely handsome buildings and vistas and distances, a London of gardens\r\nand labyrinthine tall museums, of old trees and remote palaces and\r\nartificial waters. I lodged near by in West Brompton at a house in a\r\nlittle square.\r\n\r\nSo London faced me the second time, making me forget altogether for a\r\nwhile the grey, drizzling city visage that had first looked upon me. I\r\nsettled down and went to and fro to my lectures and laboratory; in the\r\nbeginning I worked hard, and only slowly did the curiosity that\r\npresently possessed me to know more of this huge urban province arise,\r\nthe desire to find something beyond mechanism that I could serve, some\r\nuse other than learning. With this was a growing sense of loneliness, a\r\ndesire for adventure and intercourse. I found myself in the evenings\r\nporing over a map of London I had bought, instead of copying out\r\nlecture notes—and on Sundays I made explorations, taking omnibus rides\r\neast and west and north and south, and to enlarging and broadening the\r\nsense of great swarming hinterlands of humanity with whom I had no\r\ndealings, of whom I knew nothing....\r\n\r\nThe whole illimitable place teemed with suggestions of indefinite and\r\nsometimes outrageous possibility, of hidden but magnificent meanings.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t simply that I received a vast impression of space and\r\nmultitude and opportunity; intimate things also were suddenly dragged\r\nfrom neglected, veiled and darkened corners into an acute vividness of\r\nperception. Close at hand in the big art museum I came for the first\r\ntime upon the beauty of nudity, which I had hitherto held to be a\r\nshameful secret, flaunted and gloried in; I was made aware of beauty as\r\nnot only permissible, but desirable and frequent and of a thousand\r\nhitherto unsuspected rich aspects of life. One night in a real rapture,\r\nI walked round the upper gallery of the Albert Hall and listened for\r\nthe first time to great music; I believe now that it was a rendering of\r\nBeethoven’s Ninth Symphony....\r\n\r\nMy apprehension of spaces and places was reinforced by a quickened\r\napprehension of persons. A constant stream of people passed by me, eyes\r\nmet and challenged mine and passed—more and more I wanted then to\r\nstay—if I went eastward towards Piccadilly, women who seemed then to my\r\nboyish inexperience softly splendid and alluring, murmured to me as\r\nthey passed. Extraordinarily life unveiled. The very hoardings\r\nclamoured strangely at one’s senses and curiosities. One bought\r\npamphlets and papers full of strange and daring ideas transcending\r\none’s boldest; in the parks one heard men discussing the very existence\r\nof God, denying the rights of property, debating a hundred things that\r\none dared not think about in Wimblehurst. And after the ordinary\r\novercast day, after dull mornings, came twilight, and London lit up and\r\nbecame a thing of white and yellow and red jewels of light and\r\nwonderful floods of golden illumination and stupendous and unfathomable\r\nshadows—and there were no longer any mean or shabby people—but a great\r\nmysterious movement of unaccountable beings....\r\n\r\nAlways I was coming on the queerest new aspects. Late one Saturday\r\nnight I found myself one of a great slow-moving crowd between the\r\nblazing shops and the flaring barrows in the Harrow Road; I got into\r\nconversation with two bold-eyed girls, bought them boxes of chocolate,\r\nmade the acquaintance of father and mother and various younger brothers\r\nand sisters, sat in a public-house hilariously with them all, standing\r\nand being stood drinks, and left them in the small hours at the door of\r\n“home,” never to see them again. And once I was accosted on the\r\noutskirts of a Salvation Army meeting in one of the parks by a\r\nsilk-hatted young man of eager and serious discourse, who argued\r\nagainst scepticism with me, invited me home to tea into a clean and\r\ncheerful family of brothers and sisters and friends, and there I spent\r\nthe evening singing hymns to the harmonium (which reminded me of\r\nhalf-forgotten Chatham), and wishing all the sisters were not so\r\nobviously engaged....\r\n\r\nThen on the remote hill of this boundless city-world I found Ewart.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHow well I remember the first morning, a bright Sunday morning in early\r\nOctober, when I raided in upon Ewart! I found my old schoolfellow in\r\nbed in a room over an oil-shop in a back street at the foot of Highgate\r\nHill. His landlady, a pleasant, dirty young woman with soft-brown eyes,\r\nbrought down his message for me to come up; and up I went. The room\r\npresented itself as ample and interesting in detail and shabby with a\r\nquite commendable shabbiness. I had an impression of brown walls—they\r\nwere papered with brown paper—of a long shelf along one side of the\r\nroom, with dusty plaster casts and a small cheap lay figure of a horse,\r\nof a table and something of grey wax partially covered with a cloth,\r\nand of scattered drawings. There was a gas stove in one corner, and\r\nsome enameled ware that had been used for overnight cooking. The\r\noilcloth on the floor was streaked with a peculiar white dust. Ewart\r\nhimself was not in the first instance visible, but only a fourfold\r\ncanvas screen at the end of the room from which shouts proceeded of\r\n“Come on!” then his wiry black hair, very much rumpled, and a staring\r\nred-brown eye and his stump of a nose came round the edge of this at a\r\nheight of about three feet from the ground “It’s old Ponderevo!” he\r\nsaid, “the Early bird! And he’s caught the worm! By Jove, but it’s cold\r\nthis morning! Come round here and sit on the bed!”\r\n\r\nI walked round, wrung his hand, and we surveyed one another.\r\n\r\nHe was lying on a small wooden fold-up bed, the scanty covering of\r\nwhich was supplemented by an overcoat and an elderly but still cheerful\r\npair of check trousers, and he was wearing pajamas of a virulent pink\r\nand green. His neck seemed longer and more stringy than it had been\r\neven in our schooldays, and his upper lip had a wiry black moustache.\r\nThe rest of his ruddy, knobby countenance, his erratic hair and his\r\ngeneral hairy leanness had not even—to my perceptions grown.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” he said, “you’ve got quite decent-looking, Ponderevo! What\r\ndo you think of me?”\r\n\r\n“You’re all right. What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“Art, my son—sculpture! And incidentally—” He hesitated. “I ply a\r\ntrade. Will you hand me that pipe and those smoking things? So! You\r\ncan’t make coffee, eh? Well, try your hand. Cast down this\r\nscreen—no—fold it up and so we’ll go into the other room. I’ll keep in\r\nbed all the same. The fire’s a gas stove. Yes. Don’t make it bang. too\r\nloud as you light it—I can’t stand it this morning. You won’t smoke ...\r\nWell, it does me good to see you again, Ponderevo. Tell me what you’re\r\ndoing, and how you’re getting on.”\r\n\r\nHe directed me in the service of his simple hospitality, and presently\r\nI came back to his bed and sat down and smiled at him there, smoking\r\ncomfortably, with his hands under his head, surveying me.\r\n\r\n“How’s Life’s Morning, Ponderevo? By Jove, it must be nearly six years\r\nsince we met! They’ve got moustaches. We’ve fleshed ourselves a bit,\r\neh? And you?”\r\n\r\nI felt a pipe was becoming after all, and that lit, I gave him a\r\nfavourable sketch of my career.\r\n\r\n“Science! And you’ve worked like that! While I’ve been potting round\r\ndoing odd jobs for stone-masons and people, and trying to get to\r\nsculpture. I’ve a sort of feeling that the chisel—I began with\r\npainting, Ponderevo, and found I was colour-blind, colour-blind enough\r\nto stop it. I’ve drawn about and thought about—thought more\r\nparticularly. I give myself three days a week as an art student, and\r\nthe rest of the time I’ve a sort of trade that keeps me. And we’re\r\nstill in the beginning of things, young men starting. Do you remember\r\nthe old times at Goudhurst, our doll’s-house island, the Retreat of the\r\nTen Thousand Young Holmes and the rabbits, eh? It’s surprising, if you\r\nthink of it, to find we are still young. And we used to talk of what we\r\nwould be, and we used to talk of love! I suppose you know all about\r\nthat now, Ponderevo?”\r\n\r\nI finished and hesitated on some vague foolish lie, “No,” I said, a\r\nlittle ashamed of the truth. “Do you? I’ve been too busy.”\r\n\r\n“I’m just beginning—just as we were then. Things happen.”\r\n\r\nHe sucked at his pipe for a space and stared at the plaster cast of a\r\nflayed hand that hung on the wall.\r\n\r\n“The fact is, Ponderevo, I’m beginning to find life a most\r\nextraordinary queer set-out; the things that pull one, the things that\r\ndon’t. The wants—This business of sex. It’s a net. No end to it, no way\r\nout of it, no sense in it. There are times when women take possession\r\nof me, when my mind is like a painted ceiling at Hampton Court with the\r\npride of the flesh sprawling all over it. _Why>?_... And then again\r\nsometimes when I have to encounter a woman, I am overwhelmed by a\r\nterror of tantalising boredom—I fly, I hide, I do anything. You’ve got\r\nyour scientific explanations perhaps; what’s Nature and the universe up\r\nto in that matter?”\r\n\r\n“It’s her way, I gather, of securing the continuity of the species.”\r\n\r\n“But it doesn’t,” said Ewart. “That’s just it! No. I have succumbed\r\nto—dissipation—down the hill there. Euston Road way. And it was damned\r\nugly and mean, and I hate having done it. And the continuity of the\r\nspecies—Lord!... And why does Nature make a man so infernally ready for\r\ndrinks? There’s no sense in that anyhow.” He sat up in bed, to put this\r\nquestion with the greater earnestness. “And why has she given me a most\r\nviolent desire towards sculpture and an equally violent desire to leave\r\noff work directly I begin it, eh?... Let’s have some more coffee. I put\r\nit to you, these things puzzle me, Ponderevo. They dishearten me. They\r\nkeep me in bed.”\r\n\r\nHe had an air of having saved up these difficulties for me for some\r\ntime. He sat with his chin almost touching his knees, sucking at his\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I mean,” he went on, “when I say life is getting on to me\r\nas extraordinarily queer, I don’t see my game, nor why I was invited.\r\nAnd I don’t make anything of the world outside either. What do _you_\r\nmake of it?”\r\n\r\n“London,” I began. “It’s—so enormous!”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it! And it’s all up to nothing. You find chaps keeping grocers’\r\nshops—why the _devil_, Ponderevo, do they keep grocers’ shops? They all\r\ndo it very carefully, very steadily, very meanly. You find people\r\nrunning about and doing the most remarkable things being policemen, for\r\nexample, and burglars. They go about these businesses quite gravely and\r\nearnestly. I somehow—can’t go about mine. Is there any sense in it at\r\nall—anywhere?”\r\n\r\n“There must be sense in it,” I said. “We’re young.”\r\n\r\n“We’re young—yes. But one must inquire. The grocer’s a grocer because,\r\nI suppose, he sees he comes in there. Feels that on the whole it\r\namounts to a call.... But the bother is I don’t see where I come in at\r\nall. Do you?”\r\n\r\n“Where _you_ come in?”\r\n\r\n“No, where _you _come in.”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly, yet,” I said. “I want to do some good in the\r\nworld—something—something effectual, before I die. I have a sort of\r\nidea my scientific work—I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he mused. “And I’ve got a sort of idea my sculpture,—but _how_\r\nit is to come in and _why_,—I’ve no idea at all.” He hugged his knees\r\nfor a space. “That’s what puzzles me, Ponderevo, no end.”\r\n\r\nHe became animated. “If you will look in that cupboard,” he said, “you\r\nwill find an old respectable looking roll on a plate and a knife\r\nsomewhere and a gallipot containing butter. You give them me and I’ll\r\nmake my breakfast, and then if you don’t mind watching me paddle about\r\nat my simple toilet I’ll get up. Then we’ll go for a walk and talk\r\nabout this affair of life further. And about Art and Literature and\r\nanything else that crops up on the way.... Yes, that’s the gallipot.\r\nCockroach got in it? Chuck him out—damned interloper....”\r\n\r\nSo in the first five minutes of our talk, as I seem to remember it now,\r\nold Ewart struck the note that ran through all that morning’s\r\nintercourse....\r\n\r\nTo me it was a most memorable talk because it opened out quite new\r\nhorizons of thought. I’d been working rather close and out of touch\r\nwith Ewart’s free gesticulating way. He was pessimistic that day and\r\nsceptical to the very root of things. He made me feel clearly, what I\r\nhad not felt at all before, the general adventurousness of life,\r\nparticularly of life at the stage we had reached, and also the absence\r\nof definite objects, of any concerted purpose in the lives that were\r\ngoing on all round us. He made me feel, too, how ready I was to take up\r\ncommonplace assumptions. Just as I had always imagined that somewhere\r\nin social arrangements there was certainly a Head-Master who would\r\nintervene if one went too far, so I had always had a sort of implicit\r\nbelief that in our England there were somewhere people who understood\r\nwhat we were all, as a nation, about. That crumpled into his pit of\r\ndoubt and vanished.\r\n\r\nHe brought out, sharply cut and certain, the immense effect of\r\npurposelessness in London that I was already indistinctly feeling. We\r\nfound ourselves at last returning through Highgate Cemetery and\r\nWaterlow Park—and Ewart was talking.\r\n\r\n“Look at it there,” he said, stopping and pointing to the great vale of\r\nLondon spreading wide and far. “It’s like a sea—and we swim in it. And\r\nat last down we go, and then up we come—washed up here.” He swung his\r\narms to the long slopes about us, tombs and headstones in long\r\nperspectives, in limitless rows.\r\n\r\n“We’re young, Ponderevo, but sooner or later our whitened memories will\r\nwash up on one of these beaches, on some such beach as this. George\r\nPonderevo, F.R.S., Sidney Ewart, R.I.P. Look at the rows of ’em!”\r\n\r\nHe paused. “Do you see that hand? The hand, I mean, pointing upward, on\r\nthe top of a blunted obelisk. Yes. Well, that’s what I do for a\r\nliving—when I’m not thinking, or drinking, or prowling, or making love,\r\nor pretending I’m trying to be a sculptor without either the money or\r\nthe morals for a model. See? And I do those hearts afire and those\r\npensive angel guardians with the palm of peace. Damned well I do ’em\r\nand damned cheap! I’m a sweated victim, Ponderevo...”\r\n\r\nThat was the way of it, anyhow. I drank deep of talk that day; we went\r\ninto theology, into philosophy; I had my first glimpse of socialism. I\r\nfelt as though I had been silent in a silence since I and he had\r\nparted. At the thought of socialism Ewart’s moods changed for a time to\r\na sort of energy. “After all, all this confounded vagueness _might_ be\r\naltered. If you could get men to work together...”\r\n\r\nIt was a good talk that rambled through all the universe. I thought I\r\nwas giving my mind refreshment, but indeed it was dissipation. All\r\nsorts of ideas, even now, carry me back as it were to a fountain-head,\r\nto Waterlow Park and my resuscitated Ewart. There stretches away south\r\nof us long garden slopes and white gravestones and the wide expanse of\r\nLondon, and somewhere in the picture is a red old wall, sun-warmed, and\r\na great blaze of Michaelmas daisies set off with late golden sunflowers\r\nand a drift of mottled, blood-red, fallen leaves. It was with me that\r\nday as though I had lifted my head suddenly out of dull and immediate\r\nthings and looked at life altogether.... But it played the very devil\r\nwith the copying up of my arrears of notes to which I had vowed the\r\nlatter half of that day.\r\n\r\nAfter that reunion Ewart and I met much and talked much, and in our\r\nsubsequent encounters his monologue was interrupted and I took my\r\nshare. He had exercised me so greatly that I lay awake at nights\r\nthinking him over, and discoursed and answered him in my head as I went\r\nin the morning to the College. I am by nature a doer and only by the\r\nway a critic; his philosophical assertion of the incalculable vagueness\r\nof life which fitted his natural indolence roused my more irritable and\r\nenergetic nature to active protests. “It’s all so pointless,” I said,\r\n“because people are slack and because it’s in the ebb of an age. But\r\nyou’re a socialist. Well, let’s bring that about! And there’s a\r\npurpose. There you are!”\r\n\r\nEwart gave me all my first conceptions of socialism; in a little while\r\nI was an enthusiastic socialist and he was a passive resister to the\r\npractical exposition of the theories he had taught me. “We must join\r\nsome organisation,” I said. “We ought to do things.... We ought to go\r\nand speak at street corners. People don’t know.”\r\n\r\nYou must figure me a rather ill-dressed young man in a state of great\r\nearnestness, standing up in that shabby studio of his and saying these\r\nthings, perhaps with some gesticulations, and Ewart with a clay-smudged\r\nface, dressed perhaps in a flannel shirt and trousers, with a pipe in\r\nhis mouth, squatting philosophically at a table, working at some chunk\r\nof clay that never got beyond suggestion.\r\n\r\n“I wonder why one doesn’t want to,” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was only very slowly I came to gauge Ewart’s real position in the\r\nscheme of things, to understand how deliberate and complete was this\r\ndetachment of his from the moral condemnation and responsibilities that\r\nplayed so fine a part in his talk. His was essentially the nature of an\r\nartistic appreciator; he could find interest and beauty in endless\r\naspects of things that I marked as evil, or at least as not negotiable;\r\nand the impulse I had towards self-deception, to sustained and\r\nconsistent self-devotion, disturbed and detached and pointless as it\r\nwas at that time, he had indeed a sort of admiration for but no\r\nsympathy. Like many fantastic and ample talkers he was at bottom\r\nsecretive, and he gave me a series of little shocks of discovery\r\nthroughout our intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe first of these came in the realisation that he quite seriously\r\nmeant to do nothing in the world at all towards reforming the evils he\r\nlaid bare in so easy and dexterous a manner. The next came in the\r\nsudden appearance of a person called “Milly”—I’ve forgotten her\r\nsurname—whom I found in his room one evening, simply attired in a blue\r\nwrap—the rest of her costume behind the screen—smoking cigarettes and\r\nsharing a flagon of an amazingly cheap and self-assertive grocer’s wine\r\nEwart affected, called “Canary Sack.” “Hullo!” said Ewart, as I came\r\nin. “This is Milly, you know. She’s been being a model—she IS a model\r\nreally.... (keep calm, Ponderevo!) Have some sack?”\r\n\r\nMilly was a woman of thirty, perhaps, with a broad, rather pretty face,\r\na placid disposition, a bad accent and delightful blond hair that waved\r\noff her head with an irrepressible variety of charm; and whenever Ewart\r\nspoke she beamed at him. Ewart was always sketching this hair of hers\r\nand embarking upon clay statuettes of her that were never finished. She\r\nwas, I know now, a woman of the streets, whom Ewart had picked up in\r\nthe most casual manner, and who had fallen in love with him, but my\r\ninexperience in those days was too great for me to place her then, and\r\nEwart offered no elucidations. She came to him, he went to her, they\r\ntook holidays together in the country when certainly she sustained her\r\nfair share of their expenditure. I suspect him now even of taking money\r\nfrom her. Odd old Ewart! It was a relationship so alien to my orderly\r\nconceptions of honour, to what I could imagine any friend of mine\r\ndoing, that I really hardly saw it with it there under my nose. But I\r\nsee it and I think I understand it now....\r\n\r\nBefore I fully grasped the discursive manner in which Ewart was\r\ncommitted to his particular way in life, I did, I say, as the broad\r\nconstructive ideas of socialism took hold of me, try to get him to work\r\nwith me in some definite fashion as a socialist.\r\n\r\n“We ought to join on to other socialists,” I said.\r\n\r\n“They’ve got something.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s go and look at some first.”\r\n\r\nAfter some pains we discovered the office of the Fabian Society,\r\nlurking in a cellar in Clement’s Inn; and we went and interviewed a\r\nrather discouraging secretary who stood astraddle in front of a fire\r\nand questioned us severely and seemed to doubt the integrity of our\r\nintentions profoundly. He advised us to attend the next open meeting in\r\nClifford’s Inn and gave us the necessary data. We both contrived to get\r\nto the affair, and heard a discursive gritty paper on Trusts and one of\r\nthe most inconclusive discussions you can imagine. Three-quarters of\r\nthe speakers seemed under some jocular obsession which took the form of\r\npretending to be conceited. It was a sort of family joke, and as\r\nstrangers to the family we did not like it.... As we came out through\r\nthe narrow passage from Clifford’s Inn to the Strand, Ewart suddenly\r\npitched upon a wizened, spectacled little man in a vast felt hat and a\r\nlarge orange tie.\r\n\r\n“How many members are there in this Fabian Society of yours?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe little man became at once defensive in his manner.\r\n\r\n“About seven hundred,” he said; “perhaps eight.”\r\n\r\n“Like—like the ones here?”\r\n\r\nThe little man gave a nervous self-satisfied laugh. “I suppose they’re\r\nup to sample,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe little man dropped out of existence and we emerged upon the Strand.\r\nEwart twisted his arm into a queerly eloquent gesture that gathered up\r\nall the tall façades of the banks, the business places, the projecting\r\nclock and towers of the Law Courts, the advertisements, the luminous\r\nsigns, into one social immensity, into a capitalistic system gigantic\r\nand invincible.\r\n\r\n“These socialists have no sense of proportion,” he said. “What can you\r\nexpect of them?”\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nEwart, as the embodiment of talk, was certainly a leading factor in my\r\nconspicuous failure to go on studying. Social theory in its first crude\r\nform of Democratic Socialism gripped my intelligence more and more\r\npowerfully. I argued in the laboratory with the man who shared my bench\r\nuntil we quarreled and did not speak and also I fell in love.\r\n\r\nThe ferment of sex had been creeping into my being like a slowly\r\nadvancing tide through all my Wimblehurst days, the stimulus of London\r\nwas like the rising of a wind out of the sea that brings the waves in\r\nfast and high. Ewart had his share in that. More and more acutely and\r\nunmistakably did my perception of beauty, form and sound, my desire for\r\nadventure, my desire for intercourse, converge on this central and\r\ncommanding business of the individual life. I had to get me a mate.\r\n\r\nI began to fall in love faintly with girls I passed in the street, with\r\nwomen who sat before me in trains, with girl fellow-students, with\r\nladies in passing carriages, with loiterers at the corners, with\r\nneat-handed waitresses in shops and tea-rooms, with pictures even of\r\ngirls and women. On my rare visits to the theatre I always became\r\nexalted, and found the actresses and even the spectators about me\r\nmysterious, attractive, creatures of deep interest and desire. I had a\r\nstronger and stronger sense that among these glancing, passing\r\nmultitudes there was somewhere one who was for me. And in spite of\r\nevery antagonistic force in the world, there was something in my very\r\nmarrow that insisted: “Stop! Look at this one! Think of her! Won’t she\r\ndo? This signifies—this before all things signifies! Stop! Why are you\r\nhurrying by? This may be the predestined person—before all others.”\r\n\r\nIt is odd that I can’t remember when first I saw Marion, who became my\r\nwife—whom I was to make wretched, who was to make me wretched, who was\r\nto pluck that fine generalised possibility of love out of my early\r\nmanhood and make it a personal conflict. I became aware of her as one\r\nof a number of interesting attractive figures that moved about in my\r\nworld, that glanced back at my eyes, that flitted by with a kind of\r\naverted watchfulness. I would meet her coming through the Art Museum,\r\nwhich was my short cut to the Brompton Road, or see her sitting,\r\nreading as I thought, in one of the bays of the Education Library. But\r\nreally, as I found out afterwards, she never read. She used to come\r\nthere to eat a bun in quiet. She was a very gracefully-moving figure of\r\na girl then, very plainly dressed, with dark brown hair I remember, in\r\na knot low on her neck behind that confessed the pretty roundness of\r\nher head and harmonised with the admirable lines of ears and cheek, the\r\ngrave serenity of mouth and brow.\r\n\r\nShe stood out among the other girls very distinctly because they\r\ndressed more than she did, struck emphatic notes of colour, startled\r\none by novelties in hats and bows and things. I’ve always hated the\r\nrustle, the disconcerting colour boundaries, the smart unnatural angles\r\nof women’s clothes. Her plain black dress gave her a starkness....\r\n\r\nI do remember, though, how one afternoon I discovered the peculiar\r\nappeal of her form for me. I had been restless with my work and had\r\nfinally slipped out of the Laboratory and come over to the Art Museum\r\nto lounge among the pictures. I came upon her in an odd corner of the\r\nSheepshanks gallery, intently copying something from a picture that\r\nhung high. I had just been in the gallery of casts from the antique, my\r\nmind was all alive with my newly awakened sense of line, and there she\r\nstood with face upturned, her body drooping forward from the hips just\r\na little—memorably graceful—feminine.\r\n\r\nAfter that I know I sought to see her, felt a distinctive emotion at\r\nher presence, began to imagine things about her. I no longer thought of\r\ngeneralised womanhood or of this casual person or that. I thought of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAn accident brought us together. I found myself one Monday morning in\r\nan omnibus staggering westward from Victoria—I was returning from a\r\nSunday I’d spent at Wimblehurst in response to a unique freak of\r\nhospitality on the part of Mr. Mantell. She was the sole other inside\r\npassenger. And when the time came to pay her fare, she became an\r\nextremely scared, disconcerted and fumbling young woman; she had left\r\nher purse at home.\r\n\r\nLuckily I had some money.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with startled, troubled brown eyes; she permitted my\r\nproffered payment to the conductor with a certain ungraciousness that\r\nseemed a part of her shyness, and then as she rose to go, she thanked\r\nme with an obvious affectation of ease.\r\n\r\n“Thank you so much,” she said in a pleasant soft voice; and then less\r\ngracefully, “Awfully kind of you, you know.”\r\n\r\nI fancy I made polite noises. But just then I wasn’t disposed to be\r\ncritical. I was full of the sense of her presence; her arm was\r\nstretched out over me as she moved past me, the gracious slenderness of\r\nher body was near me. The words we used didn’t seem very greatly to\r\nmatter. I had vague ideas of getting out with her—and I didn’t.\r\n\r\nThat encounter, I have no doubt, exercised me enormously. I lay awake\r\nat night rehearsing it, and wondering about the next phase of our\r\nrelationship. That took the form of the return of my twopence. I was in\r\nthe Science Library, digging something out of the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_, when she appeared beside me and placed on the open page an\r\nevidently premeditated thin envelope, bulgingly confessing the coins\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n“It was so very kind of you,” she said, “the other day. I don’t know\r\nwhat I should have done, Mr.—”\r\n\r\nI supplied my name. “I knew,” I said, “you were a student here.”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly a student. I—”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow, I knew you were here frequently. And I’m a student\r\nmyself at the Consolidated Technical Schools.”\r\n\r\nI plunged into autobiography and questionings, and so entangled her in\r\na conversation that got a quality of intimacy through the fact that,\r\nout of deference to our fellow-readers, we were obliged to speak in\r\nundertones. And I have no doubt that in substance it was singularly\r\nbanal. Indeed I have an impression that all our early conversations\r\nwere incredibly banal. We met several times in a manner\r\nhalf-accidental, half furtive and wholly awkward. Mentally I didn’t\r\ntake hold of her. I never did take hold of her mentally. Her talk, I\r\nnow know all too clearly, was shallow, pretentious, evasive. Only—even\r\nto this day—I don’t remember it as in any way vulgar. She was, I could\r\nsee quite clearly, anxious to overstate or conceal her real social\r\nstatus, a little desirous to be taken for a student in the art school\r\nand a little ashamed that she wasn’t. She came to the museum to “copy\r\nthings,” and this, I gathered, had something to do with some way of\r\npartially earning her living that I wasn’t to inquire into. I told her\r\nthings about myself, vain things that I felt might appeal to her, but\r\nthat I learnt long afterwards made her think me “conceited.” We talked\r\nof books, but there she was very much on her guard and secretive, and\r\nrather more freely of pictures. She “liked” pictures. I think from the\r\noutset I appreciated and did not for a moment resent that hers was a\r\ncommonplace mind, that she was the unconscious custodian of something\r\nthat had gripped my most intimate instinct, that she embodied the hope\r\nof a possibility, was the careless proprietor of a physical quality\r\nthat had turned my head like strong wine. I felt I had to stick to our\r\nacquaintance, flat as it was. Presently we should get through these\r\nirrelevant exterior things, and come to the reality of love beneath.\r\n\r\nI saw her in dreams released, as it were, from herself, beautiful,\r\nworshipful, glowing. And sometimes when we were together, we would come\r\non silences through sheer lack of matter, and then my eyes would feast\r\non her, and the silence seemed like the drawing back of a curtain—her\r\nsuperficial self. Odd, I confess. Odd, particularly, the enormous hold\r\nof certain things about her upon me, a certain slight rounded duskiness\r\nof skin, a certain perfection of modelling in her lips, her brow, a\r\ncertain fine flow about the shoulders. She wasn’t indeed beautiful to\r\nmany people—these things are beyond explaining. She had manifest\r\ndefects of form and feature, and they didn’t matter at all. Her\r\ncomplexion was bad, but I don’t think it would have mattered if it had\r\nbeen positively unwholesome. I had extraordinarily limited,\r\nextraordinarily painful, desires. I longed intolerably to kiss her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe affair was immensely serious and commanding to me. I don’t remember\r\nthat in these earlier phases I had any thought of turning back at all.\r\nIt was clear to me that she regarded me with an eye entirely more\r\ncritical than I had for her, that she didn’t like my scholarly\r\nuntidiness, my want of even the most commonplace style. “Why do you\r\nwear collars like that?” she said, and sent me in pursuit of\r\ngentlemanly neckwear. I remember when she invited me a little abruptly\r\none day to come to tea at her home on the following Sunday and meet her\r\nfather and mother and aunt, that I immediately doubted whether my\r\nhitherto unsuspected best clothes would create the impression she\r\ndesired me to make on her belongings. I put off the encounter until the\r\nSunday after, to get myself in order. I had a morning coat made and I\r\nbought a silk hat, and had my reward in the first glance of admiration\r\nshe ever gave me. I wonder how many of my sex are as preposterous. I\r\nwas, you see, abandoning all my beliefs, my conventions unasked. I was\r\nforgetting myself immensely. And there was a conscious shame in it all.\r\nNever a word—did I breathe to Ewart—to any living soul of what was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nHer father and mother and aunt struck me as the dismalest of people,\r\nand her home in Walham Green was chiefly notable for its black and\r\namber tapestry carpets and curtains and table-cloths, and the age and\r\nirrelevance of its books, mostly books with faded gilt on the covers.\r\nThe windows were fortified against the intrusive eye by cheap lace\r\ncurtains and an “art pot” upon an unstable octagonal table. Several\r\nframed Art School drawings of Marion’s, bearing official South\r\nKensington marks of approval, adorned the room, and there was a black\r\nand gilt piano with a hymn-book on the top of it. There were draped\r\nmirrors over all the mantels, and above the sideboard in the\r\ndining-room in which we sat at tea was a portrait of her father,\r\nvillainously truthful after the manner of such works. I couldn’t see a\r\ntrace of the beauty I found in her in either parent, yet she somehow\r\ncontrived to be like them both.\r\n\r\nThese people pretended in a way that reminded me of the Three Great\r\nWomen in my mother’s room, but they had not nearly so much social\r\nknowledge and did not do it nearly so well. Also, I remarked, they did\r\nit with an eye on Marion. They had wanted to thank me, they said, for\r\nthe kindness to their daughter in the matter of the ‘bus fare, and so\r\naccounted for anything unusual in their invitation. They posed as\r\nsimple gentlefolk, a little hostile to the rush and gadding-about of\r\nLondon, preferring a secluded and unpretentious quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen Marion got out the white table-cloth from the sideboard-drawer for\r\ntea, a card bearing the word “APARTMENTS” fell to the floor. I picked\r\nit up and gave it to her before I realised from her quickened colour\r\nthat I should not have seen it; that probably had been removed from the\r\nwindow in honour of my coming.\r\n\r\nHer father spoke once in a large remote way of he claims of business\r\nengagements, and it was only long afterwards I realised that he was a\r\nsupernumerary clerk in the Walham Green Gas Works and otherwise a\r\nuseful man at home. He was a large, loose, fattish man with\r\nunintelligent brown eyes magnified by spectacles; he wore an\r\nill-fitting frock-coat and a paper collar, and he showed me, as his\r\ngreat treasure and interest, a large Bible which he had grangerised\r\nwith photographs of pictures. Also he cultivated the little garden-yard\r\nbehind the house, and he had a small greenhouse with tomatoes. “I wish\r\nI ’ad ’eat,” he said. “One can do such a lot with ’eat. But I suppose\r\nyou can’t ’ave everything you want in this world.”\r\n\r\nBoth he and Marion’s mother treated her with a deference that struck me\r\nas the most natural thing in the world. Her own manner changed, became\r\nmore authoritative and watchful, her shyness disappeared. She had taken\r\na line of her own I gathered, draped the mirror, got the second-hand\r\npiano, and broken her parents in.\r\n\r\nHer mother must once have been a pretty woman; she had regular features\r\nand Marion’s hair without its lustre, but she was thin and careworn.\r\nThe aunt, Miss Ramboat, was a large, abnormally shy person very like\r\nher brother, and I don’t recall anything she said on this occasion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with there was a good deal of tension, Marion was frightfully\r\nnervous and every one was under the necessity of behaving in a\r\nmysteriously unreal fashion until I plunged, became talkative and made\r\na certain ease and interest. I told them of the schools, of my\r\nlodgings, of Wimblehurst and my apprenticeship days. “There’s a lot of\r\nthis Science about nowadays,” Mr. Ramboat reflected; “but I sometimes\r\nwonder a bit what good it is?”\r\n\r\nI was young enough to be led into what he called “a bit of a\r\ndiscussion,” which Marion truncated before our voices became unduly\r\nraised. “I dare say,” she said, “there’s much to be said on both\r\nsides.”\r\n\r\nI remember Marion’s mother asked me what church I attended, and that I\r\nreplied evasively. After tea there was music and we sang hymns. I\r\ndoubted if I had a voice when this was proposed, but that was held to\r\nbe a trivial objection, and I found sitting close beside the sweep of\r\nhair from Marion’s brow had many compensations. I discovered her mother\r\nsitting in the horsehair armchair and regarding us sentimentally. I\r\nwent for a walk with Marion towards Putney Bridge, and then there was\r\nmore singing and a supper of cold bacon and pie, after which Mr.\r\nRamboat and I smoked. During that walk, I remember, she told me the\r\nimport of her sketchings and copyings in the museum. A cousin of a\r\nfriend of hers whom she spoke of as Smithie, had developed an original\r\nbusiness in a sort of tea-gown garment which she called a Persian Robe,\r\na plain sort of wrap with a gaily embroidered yoke, and Marion went\r\nthere and worked in the busy times. In the times that weren’t busy she\r\ndesigned novelties in yokes by an assiduous use of eyes and note-book\r\nin the museum, and went home and traced out the captured forms on the\r\nfoundation material. “I don’t get much,” said Marion, “but it’s\r\ninteresting, and in the busy times we work all day. Of course the\r\nworkgirls are dreadfully common, but we don’t say much to them. And\r\nSmithie talks enough for ten.”\r\n\r\nI quite understood the workgirls were dreadfully common.\r\n\r\nI don’t remember that the Walham Green _ménage_ and the quality of\r\nthese people, nor the light they threw on Marion, detracted in the\r\nslightest degree at that time from the intent resolve that held me to\r\nmake her mine. I didn’t like them. But I took them as part of the\r\naffair. Indeed, on the whole, I think they threw her up by an effect of\r\ncontrast; she was so obviously controlling them, so consciously\r\nsuperior to them.\r\n\r\nMore and more of my time did I give to this passion that possessed me.\r\nI began to think chiefly of ways of pleasing Marion, of acts of\r\ndevotion, of treats, of sumptuous presents for her, of appeals she\r\nwould understand. If at times she was manifestly unintelligent, in her\r\nignorance became indisputable, I told myself her simple instincts were\r\nworth all the education and intelligence in the world. And to this day\r\nI think I wasn’t really wrong about her. There was something\r\nextraordinarily fine about her, something simple and high, that\r\nflickered in and out of her ignorance and commonness and limitations\r\nlike the tongue from the mouth of a snake....\r\n\r\nOne night I was privileged to meet her and bring her home from an\r\nentertainment at the Birkbeck Institute. We came back on the\r\nunderground railway and we travelled first-class—that being the highest\r\nclass available. We were alone in the carriage, and for the first time\r\nI ventured to put my arm about her.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t,” she said feebly.\r\n\r\n“I love you,” I whispered suddenly with my heart beating wildly, drew\r\nher to me, drew all her beauty to me and kissed her cool and\r\nunresisting lips.\r\n\r\n“Love me?” she said, struggling away from me, “Don’t!” and then, as the\r\ntrain ran into a station, “You must tell no one.... I don’t know....\r\nYou shouldn’t have done that....”\r\n\r\nThen two other people got in with us and terminated my wooing for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen we found ourselves alone together, walking towards Battersea, she\r\nhad decided to be offended. I parted from her unforgiven and terribly\r\ndistressed.\r\n\r\nWhen we met again, she told me I must never say “that” again.\r\n\r\nI had dreamt that to kiss her lips was ultimate satisfaction. But it\r\nwas indeed only the beginning of desires. I told her my one ambition\r\nwas to marry her.\r\n\r\n“But,” she said, “you’re not in a position—What’s the good of talking\r\nlike that?”\r\n\r\nI stared at her. “I mean to,” I said.\r\n\r\n“You can’t,” she answered. “It will be years”\r\n\r\n“But I love you,” I insisted.\r\n\r\nI stood not a yard from the sweet lips I had kissed; I stood within\r\narm’s length of the inanimate beauty I desired to quicken, and I saw\r\nopening between us a gulf of years, toil, waiting, disappointments and\r\nan immense uncertainty.\r\n\r\n“I love you,” I said. “Don’t you love me?”\r\n\r\nShe looked me in the face with grave irresponsive eyes.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I _like_ you, of course.... One has to be\r\nsensibl...”\r\n\r\nI can remember now my sense of frustration by her unresilient reply. I\r\nshould have perceived then that for her my ardour had no quickening\r\nfire. But how was I to know? I had let myself come to want her, my\r\nimagination endowed her with infinite possibilities. I wanted her and\r\nwanted her, stupidly and instinctively....\r\n\r\n“But,” I said “Love—!”\r\n\r\n“One has to be sensible,” she replied. “I like going about with you.\r\nCan’t we keep as we are?’”\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWell, you begin to understand my breakdown now, I have been copious\r\nenough with these apologia. My work got more and more spiritless, my\r\nbehaviour degenerated, my punctuality declined; I was more and more\r\noutclassed in the steady grind by my fellow-students. Such supplies of\r\nmoral energy as I still had at command shaped now in the direction of\r\nserving Marion rather than science.\r\n\r\nI fell away dreadfully, more and more I shirked and skulked; the humped\r\nmen from the north, the pale men with thin, clenched minds, the intent,\r\nhard-breathing students I found against me, fell at last from keen\r\nrivalry to moral contempt. Even a girl got above me upon one of the\r\nlists. Then indeed I made it a point of honour to show by my public\r\ndisregard of every rule that I really did not even pretend to try.\r\n\r\nSo one day I found myself sitting in a mood of considerable\r\nastonishment in Kensington Gardens, reacting on a recent heated\r\ninterview with the school Registrar in which I had displayed more\r\nspirit than sense. I was astonished chiefly at my stupendous falling\r\naway from all the militant ideals of unflinching study I had brought up\r\nfrom Wimblehurst. I had displayed myself, as the Registrar put it, “an\r\nunmitigated rotter.” My failure to get marks in the written examination\r\nhad only been equalled by the insufficiency of my practical work.\r\n\r\n“I ask you,” the Registrar had said, “what will become of you when your\r\nscholarship runs out?”\r\n\r\nIt certainly was an interesting question. What _was_ going to become of\r\nme?\r\n\r\nIt was clear there would be nothing for me in the schools as I had once\r\ndared to hope; there seemed, indeed, scarcely anything in the world\r\nexcept an illpaid assistantship in some provincial organized Science\r\nSchool or grammar school. I knew that for that sort of work, without a\r\ndegree or any qualification, one earned hardly a bare living and had\r\nlittle leisure to struggle up to anything better. If only I had even as\r\nlittle as fifty pounds I might hold out in London and take my B.Sc.\r\ndegree, and quadruple my chances! My bitterness against my uncle\r\nreturned at the thought. After all, he had some of my money still, or\r\nought to have. Why shouldn’t I act within my rights, threaten to ‘take\r\nproceedings’? I meditated for a space on the idea, and then returned to\r\nthe Science Library and wrote him a very considerable and occasionally\r\npungent letter.\r\n\r\nThat letter to my uncle was the nadir of my failure. Its remarkable\r\nconsequences, which ended my student days altogether, I will tell in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nI say “my failure.” Yet there are times when I can even doubt whether\r\nthat period was a failure at all, when I become defensively critical of\r\nthose exacting courses I did not follow, the encyclopaedic process of\r\nscientific exhaustion from which I was distracted. My mind was not\r\ninactive, even if it fed on forbidden food. I did not learn what my\r\nprofessors and demonstrators had resolved I should learn, but I learnt\r\nmany things. My mind learnt to swing wide and to swing by itself.\r\n\r\nAfter all, those other fellows who took high places in the College\r\nexaminations and were the professor’s model boys haven’t done so\r\namazingly. Some are professors themselves, some technical experts; not\r\none can show things done such as I, following my own interest, have\r\nachieved. For I have built boats that smack across the water like\r\nwhiplashes; no one ever dreamt of such boats until I built them; and I\r\nhave surprised three secrets that are more than technical discoveries,\r\nin the unexpected hiding-places of Nature. I have come nearer flying\r\nthan any man has done. Could I have done as much if I had had a turn\r\nfor obeying those rather mediocre professors at the college who\r\nproposed to train my mind? If I had been _trained_ in research—that\r\nridiculous contradiction in terms—should I have done more than produce\r\nadditions to the existing store of little papers with blunted\r\nconclusions, of which there are already too many? I see no sense in\r\nmock modesty upon this matter. Even by the standards of worldly success\r\nI am, by the side of my fellow-students, no failure. I had my F.R.S. by\r\nthe time I was thirty-seven, and if I am not very wealthy poverty is as\r\nfar from me as the Spanish Inquisition. Suppose I had stamped down on\r\nthe head of my wandering curiosity, locked my imagination in a box just\r\nwhen it wanted to grow out to things, worked by so-and-so’s excellent\r\nmethod and so-and-so’s indications, where should I be now?\r\n\r\nI may be all wrong in this. It may be I should be a far more efficient\r\nman than I am if I had cut off all those divergent expenditures of\r\nenergy, plugged up my curiosity about society with more currently\r\nacceptable rubbish or other, abandoned Ewart, evaded Marion instead of\r\npursuing her, concentrated. But I don’t believe it!\r\n\r\nHowever, I certainly believed it completely and was filled with remorse\r\non that afternoon when I sat dejectedly in Kensington Gardens and\r\nreviewed, in the light of the Registrar’s pertinent questions my first\r\ntwo years in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\r\nTHE DAWN COMES, AND MY UNCLE APPEARS IN A NEW SILK HAT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThroughout my student days I had not seen my uncle. I refrained from\r\ngoing to him in spite of an occasional regret that in this way I\r\nestranged myself from my aunt Susan, and I maintained a sulky attitude\r\nof mind towards him. And I don’t think that once in all that time I\r\ngave a thought to that mystic word of his that was to alter all the\r\nworld for us. Yet I had not altogether forgotten it. It was with a\r\ntouch of memory, dim transient perplexity if no more—why did this thing\r\nseem in some way personal?—that I read a new inscription upon the\r\nhoardings:\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF VIGOUR,\r\nTONO-BUNGAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was all. It was simple and yet in some way arresting. I found\r\nmyself repeating the word after I had passed; it roused one’s attention\r\nlike the sound of distant guns. “Tono”—what’s that? and deep, rich,\r\nunhurrying;—“_bun_—gay!”\r\n\r\nThen came my uncle’s amazing telegram, his answer to my hostile note:\r\n“_Come to me at once you are wanted three hundred a year certain\r\ntono-bungay._”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” I cried, “of course!\r\n\r\n“It’s something—. A patent-medicine! I wonder what he wants with me.”\r\n\r\nIn his Napoleonic way my uncle had omitted to give an address. His\r\ntelegram had been handed in at Farringdon Road, and after complex\r\nmeditations I replied to Ponderevo, Farringdon Road, trusting to the\r\nrarity of our surname to reach him.\r\n\r\n“Where are you?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHis reply came promptly:\r\n\r\n“192A, Raggett Street, E.C.”\r\n\r\nThe next day I took an unsanctioned holiday after the morning’s\r\nlecture. I discovered my uncle in a wonderfully new silk hat—oh, a\r\nsplendid hat! with a rolling brim that went beyond the common fashion.\r\nIt was decidedly too big for him—that was its only fault. It was stuck\r\non the back of his head, and he was in a white waistcoat and shirt\r\nsleeves. He welcomed me with a forgetfulness of my bitter satire and my\r\nhostile abstinence that was almost divine. His glasses fell off at the\r\nsight of me. His round inexpressive eyes shone brightly. He held out\r\nhis plump short hand.\r\n\r\n“Here we are, George! What did I tell you? Needn’t whisper it now, my\r\nboy. Shout it—_loud!_ spread it about! Tell every one! Tono—TONO—,\r\nTONO-BUNGAY!”\r\n\r\nRaggett Street, you must understand, was a thoroughfare over which some\r\none had distributed large quantities of cabbage stumps and leaves. It\r\nopened out of the upper end of Farringdon Street, and 192A was a shop\r\nwith the plate-glass front coloured chocolate, on which several of the\r\nsame bills I had read upon the hoardings had been stuck. The floor was\r\ncovered by street mud that had been brought in on dirty boots, and\r\nthree energetic young men of the hooligan type, in neck-wraps and caps,\r\nwere packing wooden cases with papered-up bottles, amidst much straw\r\nand confusion. The counter was littered with these same swathed\r\nbottles, of a pattern then novel but now amazingly familiar in the\r\nworld, the blue paper with the coruscating figure of a genially nude\r\ngiant, and the printed directions of how under practically all\r\ncircumstances to take Tono-Bungay. Beyond the counter on one side\r\nopened a staircase down which I seem to remember a girl descending with\r\na further consignment of bottles, and the rest of the background was a\r\nhigh partition, also chocolate, with “Temporary Laboratory” inscribed\r\nupon it in white letters, and over a door that pierced it, “Office.”\r\nHere I rapped, inaudible amid much hammering, and then entered\r\nunanswered to find my uncle, dressed as I have described, one hand\r\ngripping a sheath of letters, and the other scratching his head as he\r\ndictated to one of three toiling typewriter girls. Behind him was a\r\nfurther partition and a door inscribed “ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE—NO\r\nADMISSION,” thereon. This partition was of wood painted the universal\r\nchocolate, up to about eight feet from the ground, and then of glass.\r\nThrough the glass I saw dimly a crowded suggestion of crucibles and\r\nglass retorts, and—by Jove!—yes!—the dear old Wimblehurst air-pump\r\nstill! It gave me quite a little thrill—that air-pump! And beside it\r\nwas the electrical machine—but something—some serious trouble—had\r\nhappened to that. All these were evidently placed on a shelf just at\r\nthe level to show.\r\n\r\n“Come right into the sanctum,” said my uncle, after he had finished\r\nsomething about “esteemed consideration,” and whisked me through the\r\ndoor into a room that quite amazingly failed to verify the promise of\r\nthat apparatus. It was papered with dingy wall-paper that had peeled in\r\nplaces; it contained a fireplace, an easy-chair with a cushion, a table\r\non which stood two or three big bottles, a number of cigar-boxes on the\r\nmantel, whisky Tantalus and a row of soda syphons. He shut the door\r\nafter me carefully.\r\n\r\n“Well, here we are!” he said. “Going strong! Have a whisky, George?\r\nNo!—Wise man! Neither will I! You see me at it! At it—hard!”\r\n\r\n“Hard at what?”\r\n\r\n“Read it,” and he thrust into my hand a label—that label that has now\r\nbecome one of the most familiar objects of the chemist’s shop, the\r\ngreenish-blue rather old-fashioned bordering, the legend, the name in\r\ngood black type, very clear, and the strong man all set about with\r\nlightning flashes above the double column of skilful lies in red—the\r\nlabel of Tono-Bungay. “It’s afloat,” he said, as I stood puzzling at\r\nthis. “It’s afloat. I’m afloat!” And suddenly he burst out singing in\r\nthat throaty tenor of his—\r\n\r\n“I’m afloat, I’m afloat on the fierce flowing tide,\r\nThe ocean’s my home and my bark is my bride!\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ripping song that is, George. Not so much a bark as a solution, but\r\nstill—it does! Here we are at it! By-the-by! Half a mo’! I’ve thought\r\nof a thing.” He whisked out, leaving me to examine this nuclear spot at\r\nleisure while his voice became dictatorial without. The den struck me\r\nas in its large grey dirty way quite unprecedented and extraordinary.\r\nThe bottles were all labelled simply A, B, C, and so forth, and that\r\ndear old apparatus above, seen from this side, was even more patiently\r\n“on the shelf” than when it had been used to impress Wimblehurst. I saw\r\nnothing for it but to sit down in the chair and await my uncle’s\r\nexplanations. I remarked a frock-coat with satin lapels behind the\r\ndoor; there was a dignified umbrella in the corner and a clothes-brush\r\nand a hat-brush stood on a side-table. My uncle returned in five\r\nminutes looking at his watch—a gold watch—“Gettin’ lunch-time, George,”\r\nhe said. “You’d better come and have lunch with me!”\r\n\r\n“How’s Aunt Susan?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Exuberant. Never saw her so larky. This has bucked her up something\r\nwonderful—all this.”\r\n\r\n“All what?”\r\n\r\n“Tono-Bungay.”\r\n\r\n“What is Tono-Bungay?” I asked.\r\n\r\nMy uncle hesitated. “Tell you after lunch, George,” he said. “Come\r\nalong!” and having locked up the sanctum after himself, led the way\r\nalong a narrow dirty pavement, lined with barrows and swept at times by\r\navalanche-like porters bearing burthens to vans, to Farringdon Street.\r\nHe hailed a passing cab superbly, and the cabman was infinitely\r\nrespectful. “Schäfer’s,” he said, and off we went side by side—and with\r\nme more and more amazed at all these things—to Schäfer’s Hotel, the\r\nsecond of the two big places with huge lace curtain-covered windows,\r\nnear the corner of Blackfriars Bridge.\r\n\r\nI will confess I felt a magic charm in our relative proportions as the\r\ntwo colossal, pale-blue-and-red liveried porters of Schäfers’ held open\r\nthe inner doors for us with a respectful salutation that in some manner\r\nthey seemed to confine wholly to my uncle. Instead of being about four\r\ninches taller, I felt at least the same size as he, and very much\r\nslenderer. Still more respectful—waiters relieved him of the new hat\r\nand the dignified umbrella, and took his orders for our lunch. He gave\r\nthem with a fine assurance.\r\n\r\nHe nodded to several of the waiters.\r\n\r\n“They know me, George, already,” he said. “Point me out. Live place!\r\nEye for coming men!”\r\n\r\nThe detailed business of the lunch engaged our attention for a while,\r\nand then I leant across my plate. “And NOW?” said I.\r\n\r\n“It’s the secret of vigour. Didn’t you read that label?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but—”\r\n\r\n“It’s selling like hot cakes.”\r\n\r\n“And what is it?” I pressed.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said my uncle, and then leant forward and spoke softly under\r\ncover of his hand, “It’s nothing more or less than...”\r\n\r\n(But here an unfortunate scruple intervenes. After all, Tono-Bungay is\r\nstill a marketable commodity and in the hands of purchasers, who bought\r\nit from—among other vendors—me. No! I am afraid I cannot give it away—)\r\n\r\n“You see,” said my uncle in a slow confidential whisper, with eyes very\r\nwide and a creased forehead, “it’s nice because of the” (here he\r\nmentioned a flavouring matter and an aromatic spirit), “it’s\r\nstimulating because of” (here he mentioned two very vivid tonics, one\r\nwith a marked action on the kidney.) “And the” (here he mentioned two\r\nother ingredients) “makes it pretty intoxicating. Cocks their tails.\r\nThen there’s” (but I touch on the essential secret.) “And there you\r\nare. I got it out of an old book of recipes—all except the” (here he\r\nmentioned the more virulent substance, the one that assails the\r\nkidneys), “which is my idea! Modern touch! There you are!”\r\n\r\nHe reverted to the direction of our lunch.\r\n\r\nPresently he was leading the way to the lounge—sumptuous piece in red\r\nmorocco and yellow glazed crockery, with incredible vistas of settees\r\nand sofas and things, and there I found myself grouped with him in two\r\nexcessively upholstered chairs with an earthenware Moorish table\r\nbetween us bearing coffee and Benedictine, and I was tasting the\r\ndelights of a tenpenny cigar. My uncle smoked a similar cigar in an\r\nhabituated manner, and he looked energetic and knowing and luxurious\r\nand most unexpectedly a little bounder, round the end of it. It was\r\njust a trivial flaw upon our swagger, perhaps that we both were clear\r\nour cigars had to be “mild.” He got obliquely across the spaces of his\r\ngreat armchair so as to incline confidentially to my ear, he curled up\r\nhis little legs, and I, in my longer way, adopted a corresponding\r\nreceptive obliquity. I felt that we should strike an unbiased observer\r\nas a couple of very deep and wily and developing and repulsive persons.\r\n\r\n“I want to let you into this”—puff—“George,” said my uncle round the\r\nend of his cigar. “For many reasons.”\r\n\r\nHis voice grew lower and more cunning. He made explanations that to my\r\ninexperience did not completely explain. I retain an impression of a\r\nlong credit and a share with a firm of wholesale chemists, of a credit\r\nand a prospective share with some pirate printers, of a third share for\r\na leading magazine and newspaper proprietor.\r\n\r\n“I played ’em off one against the other,” said my uncle. I took his\r\npoint in an instant. He had gone to each of them in turn and said the\r\nothers had come in.\r\n\r\n“I put up four hundred pounds,” said my uncle, “myself and my all. And\r\nyou know—”\r\n\r\nHe assumed a brisk confidence. “I hadn’t five hundred pence. At least—”\r\n\r\nFor a moment he really was just a little embarrassed. “I _did_” he\r\nsaid, “produce capital. You see, there was that trust affair of yours—I\r\nought, I suppose—in strict legality—to have put that straight first.\r\nZzzz....\r\n\r\n“It was a bold thing to do,” said my uncle, shifting the venue from the\r\nregion of honour to the region of courage. And then with a\r\ncharacteristic outburst of piety, “Thank God it’s all come right!\r\n\r\n“And now, I suppose, you ask where do YOU come in? Well, fact is I’ve\r\nalways believed in you, George. You’ve got—it’s a sort of dismal grit.\r\nBark your shins, rouse you, and you’ll go! You’d rush any position you\r\nhad a mind to rush. I know a bit about character, George—trust me.\r\nYou’ve got—” He clenched his hands and thrust them out suddenly, and at\r\nthe same time said, with explosive violence, “Wooosh! Yes. You have!\r\nThe way you put away that Latin at Wimblehurst; I’ve never forgotten\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Wo-oo-oo-osh! Your science and all that! Wo-oo-oo-osh! I know my\r\nlimitations. There’s things I can do, and” (he spoke in a whisper, as\r\nthough this was the first hint of his life’s secret) “there’s things I\r\ncan’t. Well, I can create this business, but I can’t make it go. I’m\r\ntoo voluminous—I’m a boiler-over, not a simmering stick-at-it._You_\r\nkeep on _hotting up and hotting up_. Papin’s digester. That’s you,\r\nsteady and long and piling up,—then, wo-oo-oo-oo-osh. Come in and\r\nstiffen these niggers. Teach them that wo-oo-oo-oo-osh. There you are!\r\nThat’s what I’m after. You! Nobody else believes you’re more than a\r\nboy. Come right in with me and be a man. Eh, George? Think of the fun\r\nof it—a thing on the go—a Real Live Thing! Wooshing it up! Making it\r\nbuzz and spin! Whoo-oo-oo.”—He made alluring expanding circles in the\r\nair with his hand. “Eh?”\r\n\r\nHis proposal, sinking to confidential undertones again, took more\r\ndefinite shape. I was to give all my time and energy to developing and\r\norganising. “You shan’t write a single advertisement, or give a single\r\nassurance” he declared. “I can do all that.” And the telegram was no\r\nflourish; I was to have three hundred a year. Three hundred a year.\r\n(“That’s nothing,” said my uncle, “the thing to freeze on to, when the\r\ntime comes, is your tenth of the vendor’s share.”)\r\n\r\nThree hundred a year certain, anyhow! It was an enormous income to me.\r\nFor a moment I was altogether staggered. Could there be that much money\r\nin the whole concern? I looked about me at the sumptuous furniture of\r\nSchäfer’s Hotel. No doubt there were many such incomes.\r\n\r\nMy head was spinning with unwonted Benedictine and Burgundy.\r\n\r\n“Let me go back and look at the game again,” I said. “Let me see\r\nupstairs and round about.”\r\n\r\nI did.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it all?” my uncle asked at last.\r\n\r\n“Well, for one thing,” I said, “why don’t you have those girls working\r\nin a decently ventilated room? Apart from any other consideration,\r\nthey’d work twice as briskly. And they ought to cover the corks before\r\nlabelling round the bottle.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“Because—they sometimes make a mucker of the cork job, and then the\r\nlabel’s wasted.”\r\n\r\n“Come and change it, George,” said my uncle, with sudden fervour “Come\r\nhere and make a machine of it. You can. Make it all slick, and then\r\nmake it woosh. I know you can. Oh! I know you can.”\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI seem to remember very quick changes of mind after that lunch. The\r\nmuzzy exaltation of the unaccustomed stimulants gave way very rapidly\r\nto a model of pellucid and impartial clairvoyance which is one of my\r\nhabitual mental states. It is intermittent; it leaves me for weeks\r\ntogether, I know, but back it comes at last like justice on circuit,\r\nand calls up all my impression, all my illusions, all my willful and\r\npassionate proceedings. We came downstairs again into that inner room\r\nwhich pretended to be a scientific laboratory through its high glass\r\nlights, and indeed was a lurking place. My uncle pressed a cigarette on\r\nme, and I took it and stood before the empty fireplace while he propped\r\nhis umbrella in the corner, deposited the new silk hat that was a\r\nlittle too big for him on the table, blew copiously and produced a\r\nsecond cigar.\r\n\r\nIt came into my head that he had shrunken very much in size since the\r\nWimblehurst days, that the cannon ball he had swallowed was rather more\r\nevident and shameless than it had been, his skin less fresh and the\r\nnose between his glasses, which still didn’t quite fit, much redder.\r\nAnd just then he seemed much laxer in his muscles and not quite as\r\nalertly quick in his movements. But he evidently wasn’t aware of the\r\ndegenerative nature of his changes as he sat there, looking suddenly\r\nquite little under my eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well, George!” he said, quite happily unconscious of my silent\r\ncriticism, “what do you think of it all?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “in the first place—it’s a damned swindle!”\r\n\r\n“Tut! tut!” said my uncle. “It’s as straight as—It’s fair trading!”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse for trading,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It’s the sort of thing everybody does. After all, there’s no harm in\r\nthe stuff—and it may do good. It might do a lot of good—giving people\r\nconfidence, f’rinstance, against an epidemic. See? Why not? don’t see\r\nwhere your swindle comes in.”\r\n\r\n“H’m,” I said. “It’s a thing you either see or don’t see.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to know what sort of trading isn’t a swindle in its way.\r\nEverybody who does a large advertised trade is selling something common\r\non the strength of saying it’s uncommon. Look at Chickson—they made him\r\na baronet. Look at Lord Radmore, who did it on lying about the alkali\r\nin soap! Rippin’ ads those were of his too!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean to say you think doing this stuff up in bottles and\r\nswearing it’s the quintessence of strength and making poor devils buy\r\nit at that, is straight?”\r\n\r\n“Why not, George? How do we know it mayn’t be the quintessence to them\r\nso far as they’re concerned?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” I said, and shrugged my shoulders.\r\n\r\n“There’s Faith. You put Faith in ’em.... I grant our labels are a bit\r\nemphatic. Christian Science, really. No good setting people against the\r\nmedicine. Tell me a solitary trade nowadays that hasn’t to be—emphatic.\r\nIt’s the modern way! Everybody understands it—everybody allows for it.”\r\n\r\n“But the world would be no worse and rather better, if all this stuff\r\nof yours was run down a conduit into the Thames.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t see that, George, at all. ’Mong other things, all our people\r\nwould be out of work. Unemployed! I grant you Tono-Bungay _may_ be—not\r\n_quite_ so good a find for the world as Peruvian bark, but the point\r\nis, George—it _makes trade!_ And the world lives on trade. Commerce! A\r\nromantic exchange of commodities and property. Romance. ’Magination.\r\nSee? You must look at these things in a broad light. Look at the\r\nwood—and forget the trees! And hang it, George! we got to do these\r\nthings! There’s no way unless you do. What do _you_ mean to do—anyhow?”\r\n\r\n“There’s ways of living,” I said, “Without either fraud or lying.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a bit stiff, George. There’s no fraud in this affair, I’ll bet\r\nmy hat. But what do you propose to do? Go as chemist to some one who\r\n_is_ running a business, and draw a salary without a share like I offer\r\nyou. Much sense in that! It comes out of the swindle as you call\r\nit—just the same.”\r\n\r\n“Some businesses are straight and quiet, anyhow; supply a sound article\r\nthat is really needed, don’t shout advertisements.”\r\n\r\n“No, George. There you’re behind the times. The last of that sort was\r\nsold up ‘bout five years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s scientific research.”\r\n\r\n“And who pays for that? Who put up that big City and Guilds place at\r\nSouth Kensington? Enterprising business men! They fancy they’ll have a\r\nbit of science going on, they want a handy Expert ever and again, and\r\nthere you are! And what do you get for research when you’ve done it?\r\nJust a bare living and no outlook. They just keep you to make\r\ndiscoveries, and if they fancy they’ll use ’em they do.”\r\n\r\n“One can teach.”\r\n\r\n“How much a year, George? How much a year? I suppose you must respect\r\nCarlyle! Well, you take Carlyle’s test—solvency. (Lord! what a book\r\nthat French Revolution of his is!) See what the world pays teachers and\r\ndiscoverers and what it pays business men! That shows the ones it\r\nreally wants. There’s a justice in these big things, George, over and\r\nabove the apparent injustice. I tell you it wants trade. It’s Trade\r\nthat makes the world go round! Argosies! Venice! Empire!”\r\n\r\nMy uncle suddenly rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n“You think it over, George. You think it over! And come up on Sunday to\r\nthe new place—we got rooms in Gower Street now—and see your aunt. She’s\r\noften asked for you, George often and often, and thrown it up at me\r\nabout that bit of property—though I’ve always said and always will,\r\nthat twenty-five shillings in the pound is what I’ll pay you and\r\ninterest up to the nail. And think it over. It isn’t me I ask you to\r\nhelp. It’s yourself. It’s your aunt Susan. It’s the whole concern. It’s\r\nthe commerce of your country. And we want you badly. I tell you\r\nstraight, I know my limitations. You could take this place, you could\r\nmake it go! I can see you at it—looking rather sour. Woosh is the word,\r\nGeorge.”\r\n\r\nAnd he smiled endearingly.\r\n\r\n“I got to dictate a letter,” he said, ending the smile, and vanished\r\ninto the outer room.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nI didn’t succumb without a struggle to my uncle’s allurements. Indeed,\r\nI held out for a week while I contemplated life and my prospects. It\r\nwas a crowded and muddled contemplation. It invaded even my sleep.\r\n\r\nMy interview with the Registrar, my talk with my uncle, my abrupt\r\ndiscovery of the hopeless futility of my passion for Marion, had\r\ncombined to bring me to sense of crisis. What was I going to do with\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nI remember certain phases of my indecisions very well.\r\n\r\nI remember going home from our talk. I went down Farringdon Street to\r\nthe Embankment because I thought to go home by Holborn and Oxford\r\nStreet would be too crowded for thinking.... That piece of Embankment\r\nfrom Blackfriars to Westminster still reminds me of that momentous\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nYou know, from first to last, I saw the business with my eyes open, I\r\nsaw its ethical and moral values quite clearly. Never for a moment do I\r\nremember myself faltering from my persuasion that the sale of\r\nTono-Bungay was a thoroughly dishonest proceeding. The stuff was, I\r\nperceived, a mischievous trash, slightly stimulating, aromatic and\r\nattractive, likely to become a bad habit and train people in the\r\nhabitual use of stronger tonics and insidiously dangerous to people\r\nwith defective kidneys. It would cost about sevenpence the large bottle\r\nto make, including bottling, and we were to sell it at half a crown\r\nplus the cost of the patent medicine stamp. A thing that I will confess\r\ndeterred me from the outset far more than the sense of dishonesty in\r\nthis affair, was the supreme silliness of the whole concern. I still\r\nclung to the idea that the world of men was or should be a sane and\r\njust organisation, and the idea that I should set myself gravely, just\r\nat the fine springtime of my life, to developing a monstrous bottling\r\nand packing warehouse, bottling rubbish for the consumption of foolish,\r\ncredulous and depressed people, had in it a touch of insanity. My early\r\nbeliefs still clung to me. I felt assured that somewhere there must be\r\na hitch in the fine prospect of ease and wealth under such conditions;\r\nthat somewhere, a little overgrown, perhaps, but still traceable, lay a\r\nneglected, wasted path of use and honour for me.\r\n\r\nMy inclination to refuse the whole thing increased rather than\r\ndiminished at first as I went along the Embankment. In my uncle’s\r\npresence there had been a sort of glamour that had prevented an\r\noutright refusal. It was a revival of affection for him I felt in his\r\npresence, I think, in part, and in part an instinctive feeling that I\r\nmust consider him as my host. But much more was it a curious persuasion\r\nhe had the knack of inspiring—a persuasion not so much of his integrity\r\nand capacity as of the reciprocal and yielding foolishness of the\r\nworld. One felt that he was silly and wild, but in some way silly and\r\nwild after the fashion of the universe. After all, one must live\r\nsomehow. I astonished him and myself by temporising.\r\n\r\n“No,” said I, “I’ll think it over!”\r\n\r\nAnd as I went along the embankment the first effect was all against my\r\nuncle. He shrank—for a little while he continued to shrink—in\r\nperspective until he was only a very small shabby little man in a dirty\r\nback street, sending off a few hundred bottles of rubbish to foolish\r\nbuyers. The great buildings on the right of us, the Inns and the School\r\nBoard place—as it was then—Somerset House, the big hotels, the great\r\nbridges, Westminster’s outlines ahead, had an effect of grey largeness\r\nthat reduced him to the proportions of a busy black beetle in a crack\r\nin the floor.\r\n\r\nAnd then my eye caught the advertisements on the south side of\r\n“Sorber’s Food,” of “Cracknell’s Ferric Wine,” very bright and\r\nprosperous signs, illuminated at night, and I realised how\r\nastonishingly they looked at home there, how evidently part they were\r\nin the whole thing.\r\n\r\nI saw a man come charging out of Palace Yard—the policeman touched his\r\nhelmet to him—with a hat and a bearing astonishingly like my uncle’s.\r\nAfter all,—didn’t Cracknell himself sit in the House?\r\n\r\nTono-Bungay shouted at me from a hoarding near Adelphi Terrace; I saw\r\nit afar off near Carfax Street; it cried out again upon me in\r\nKensington High Street, and burst into a perfect clamour; six or seven\r\ntimes I saw it as I drew near my diggings. It certainly had an air of\r\nbeing something more than a dream.\r\n\r\nYes, I thought it over—thoroughly enough.... Trade rules the world.\r\nWealth rather than trade! The thing was true, and true too was my\r\nuncle’s proposition that the quickest way to get wealth is to sell the\r\ncheapest thing possible in the dearest bottle. He was frightfully right\r\nafter all. _Pecunia non olet_,—a Roman emperor said that. Perhaps my\r\ngreat heroes in Plutarch were no more than such men, fine now only\r\nbecause they are distant; perhaps after all this Socialism to which I\r\nhad been drawn was only a foolish dream, only the more foolish because\r\nall its promises were conditionally true. Morris and these others\r\nplayed with it wittingly; it gave a zest, a touch of substance, to\r\ntheir aesthetic pleasures. Never would there be good faith enough to\r\nbring such things about. They knew it; every one, except a few young\r\nfools, knew it. As I crossed the corner of St. James’s Park wrapped in\r\nthought, I dodged back just in time to escape a prancing pair of greys.\r\nA stout, common-looking woman, very magnificently dressed, regarded me\r\nfrom the carriage with a scornful eye. “No doubt,” thought I, “a\r\npill-vendor’s wife....”\r\n\r\nRunning through all my thoughts, surging out like a refrain, was my\r\nuncle’s master-stroke, his admirable touch of praise: “Make it all\r\nslick—and then make it go Woosh. I know you can! Oh! I _know_ you can!”\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nEwart as a moral influence was unsatisfactory. I had made up my mind to\r\nput the whole thing before him, partly to see how he took it, and\r\npartly to hear how it sounded when it was said. I asked him to come and\r\neat with me in an Italian place near Panton Street where one could get\r\na curious, interesting, glutting sort of dinner for eighteen-pence. He\r\ncame with a disconcerting black-eye that he wouldn’t explain. “Not so\r\nmuch a black-eye,” he said, “as the aftermath of a purple patch....\r\nWhat’s your difficulty?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you with the salad,” I said.\r\n\r\nBut as a matter of fact I didn’t tell him. I threw out that I was\r\ndoubtful whether I ought to go into trade, or stick to teaching in view\r\nof my deepening socialist proclivities; and he, warming with the\r\nunaccustomed generosity of a sixteen-penny Chianti, ran on from that\r\nwithout any further inquiry as to my trouble.\r\n\r\nHis utterances roved wide and loose.\r\n\r\n“The reality of life, my dear Ponderevo,” I remember him saying very\r\nimpressively and punctuating with the nut-crackers as he spoke, “is\r\nChromatic Conflict ... and Form. Get hold of that and let all these\r\nother questions go. The Socialist will tell you one sort of colour and\r\nshape is right, the Individualist another. What does it all amount to?\r\nWhat _does_ it all amount to? _Nothing!_ I have no advice to give\r\nanyone,—except to avoid regrets. Be yourself, seek after such beautiful\r\nthings as your own sense determines to be beautiful. And don’t mind the\r\nheadache in the morning.... For what, after all, is a morning,\r\nPonderevo? It isn’t like the upper part of a day!”\r\n\r\nHe paused impressively.\r\n\r\n“What Rot!” I cried, after a confused attempt to apprehend him.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it! And it’s my bedrock wisdom in the matter! Take it or leave\r\nit, my dear George; take it or leave it.”... He put down the\r\nnut-crackers out of my reach and lugged a greasy-looking note-book from\r\nhis pocket. “I’m going to steal this mustard pot,” he said.\r\n\r\nI made noises of remonstrance.\r\n\r\n“Only as a matter of design. I’ve got to do an old beast’s tomb.\r\n\r\n“Wholesale grocer. I’ll put it on his corners,—four mustard pots. I\r\ndare say he’d be glad of a mustard plaster now to cool him, poor devil,\r\nwhere he is. But anyhow,—here goes!”\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt came to me in the small hours that the real moral touchstone for\r\nthis great doubting of mind was Marion. I lay composing statements of\r\nmy problem and imagined myself delivering them to her—and she,\r\ngoddess-like and beautiful; giving her fine, simply-worded judgment.\r\n\r\n“You see, it’s just to give one’s self over to the Capitalistic\r\nSystem,” I imagined myself saying in good Socialist jargon; “it’s\r\nsurrendering all one’s beliefs. We _may_ succeed, we _may_ grow rich,\r\nbut where would the satisfaction be?”\r\n\r\nThen she would say, “No! That wouldn’t be right.”\r\n\r\n“But the alternative is to wait!”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly she would become a goddess. She would turn upon me\r\nfrankly and nobly, with shining eyes, with arms held out. “No,” she\r\nwould say, “we love one another. Nothing ignoble shall ever touch us.\r\nWe love one another. Why wait to tell each other that, dear? What does\r\nit matter that we are poor and may keep poor?”\r\n\r\nBut indeed the conversation didn’t go at all in that direction. At the\r\nsight of her my nocturnal eloquence became preposterous and all the\r\nmoral values altered altogether. I had waited for her outside the door\r\nof the Parsian-robe establishment in Kensington High Street and walked\r\nhome with her thence. I remember how she emerged into the warm evening\r\nlight and that she wore a brown straw hat that made her, for once not\r\nonly beautiful but pretty.\r\n\r\n“I like that hat,” I said by way of opening; and she smiled her rare\r\ndelightful smile at me.\r\n\r\n“I love you,” I said in an undertone, as we jostled closer on the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head forbiddingly, but she still smiled. Then—“Be\r\nsensible!”\r\n\r\nThe High Street pavement is too narrow and crowded for conversation and\r\nwe were some way westward before we spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” I said; “I want you, Marion. Don’t you understand? I want\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Now!” she cried warningly.\r\n\r\nI do not know if the reader will understand how a passionate lover, an\r\nimmense admiration and desire, can be shot with a gleam of positive\r\nhatred. Such a gleam there was in me at the serene self-complacency of\r\nthat “_Now!_” It vanished almost before I felt it. I found no warning\r\nin it of the antagonisms latent between us.\r\n\r\n“Marion,” I said, “this isn’t a trifling matter to me. I love you; I\r\nwould die to get you.... Don’t you care?”\r\n\r\n“But what is the good?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t care,” I cried. “You don’t care a rap!”\r\n\r\n“You know I care,” she answered. “If I didn’t—If I didn’t like you very\r\nmuch, should I let you come and meet me—go about with you?”\r\n\r\n“Well then,” I said, “promise to marry me!”\r\n\r\n“If I do, what difference will it make?”\r\n\r\nWe were separated by two men carrying a ladder who drove between us\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\n“Marion,” I asked when we got together again, “I tell you I want you to\r\nmarry me.”\r\n\r\n“We can’t.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“We can’t marry—in the street.”\r\n\r\n“We could take our chance!”\r\n\r\n“I wish you wouldn’t go on talking like this. What is the good?”\r\n\r\nShe suddenly gave way to gloom. “It’s no good marrying” she said.\r\n“One’s only miserable. I’ve seen other girls. When one’s alone one has\r\na little pocket-money anyhow, one can go about a little. But think of\r\nbeing married and no money, and perhaps children—you can’t be sure....”\r\n\r\nShe poured out this concentrated philosophy of her class and type in\r\njerky uncompleted sentences, with knitted brows, with discontented eyes\r\ntowards the westward glow—forgetful, it seemed, for a moment even of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Marion,” I said abruptly, “what would you marry on?”\r\n\r\n“What _is_ the good?” she began.\r\n\r\n“Would you marry on three hundred a year?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me for a moment. “That’s six pounds a week,” she said.\r\n“One could manage on that, easily. Smithie’s brother—No, he only gets\r\ntwo hundred and fifty. He married a typewriting girl.”\r\n\r\n“Will you marry me if I get three hundred a year?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me again, with a curious gleam of hope.\r\n\r\n“_If!_” she said.\r\n\r\nI held out my hand and looked her in the eyes. “It’s a bargain,” I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated and touched my hand for an instant. “It’s silly,” she\r\nremarked as she did so. “It means really we’re—” She paused.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Engaged. You’ll have to wait years. What good can it do you?”\r\n\r\n“Not so many years.” I answered.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she brooded.\r\n\r\nThen she glanced at me with a smile, half-sweet, half-wistful, that has\r\nstuck in my memory for ever.\r\n\r\n“I like you!” she said. “I shall like to be engaged to you.”\r\n\r\nAnd, faint on the threshold of hearing, I caught her ventured “dear!”\r\nIt’s odd that in writing this down my memory passed over all that\r\nintervened and I feel it all again, and once again I’m Marion’s boyish\r\nlover taking great joy in such rare and little things.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAt last I went to the address my uncle had given me in Gower Street,\r\nand found my aunt Susan waiting tea for him.\r\n\r\nDirectly I came into the room I appreciated the change in outlook that\r\nthe achievement of Tono-Bungay had made almost as vividly as when I saw\r\nmy uncle’s new hat. The furniture of the room struck upon my eye as\r\nalmost stately. The chairs and sofa were covered with chintz which gave\r\nit a dim, remote flavour of Bladesover; the mantel, the cornice, the\r\ngas pendant were larger and finer than the sort of thing I had grown\r\naccustomed to in London. And I was shown in by a real housemaid with\r\nreal tails to her cap, and great quantities of reddish hair. There was\r\nmy aunt too looking bright and pretty, in a blue-patterned tea-wrap\r\nwith bows that seemed to me the quintessence of fashion. She was\r\nsitting in a chair by the open window with quite a pile of\r\nyellow-labelled books on the occasional table beside her. Before the\r\nlarge, paper-decorated fireplace stood a three-tiered cake-stand\r\ndisplaying assorted cakes, and a tray with all the tea equipage except\r\nthe teapot, was on the large centre-table. The carpet was thick, and a\r\nspice of adventure was given it by a number of dyed sheep-skin mats.\r\n\r\n“Hel-_lo!_” said my aunt as I appeared. “It’s George!”\r\n\r\n“Shall I serve the tea now, Mem?” said the real housemaid, surveying\r\nour greeting coldly.\r\n\r\n“Not till Mr. Ponderevo comes, Meggie,” said my aunt, and grimaced with\r\nextraordinary swiftness and virulence as the housemaid turned her back.\r\n\r\n“Meggie she calls herself,” said my aunt as the door closed, and left\r\nme to infer a certain want of sympathy.\r\n\r\n“You’re looking very jolly, aunt,” said I.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of all this old Business he’s got?” asked my aunt.\r\n\r\n“Seems a promising thing,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I suppose there is a business somewhere?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you seen it?”\r\n\r\n“‘Fraid I’d say something AT it George, if I did. So he won’t let me.\r\nIt came on quite suddenly. Brooding he was and writing letters and\r\nsizzling something awful—like a chestnut going to pop. Then he came\r\nhome one day saying Tono-Bungay till I thought he was clean off his\r\nonion, and singing—what was it?”\r\n\r\n“‘I’m afloat, I’m afloat,’” I guessed.\r\n\r\n“The very thing. You’ve heard him. And saying our fortunes were made.\r\nTook me out to the Ho’burm Restaurant, George,—dinner, and we had\r\nchampagne, stuff that blows up the back of your nose and makes you go\r\n_So_, and he said at last he’d got things worthy of me—and we moved\r\nhere next day. It’s a swell house, George. Three pounds a week for the\r\nrooms. And he says the Business’ll stand it.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Either do that or smash,” I said profoundly.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the question for a moment mutely with our eyes. My aunt\r\nslapped the pile of books from Mudie’s.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been having such a Go of reading, George. You never did!”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of the business?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, they’ve let him have money,” she said, and thought and raised\r\nher eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“It’s been a time,” she went on. “The flapping about! Me sitting doing\r\nnothing and him on the go like a rocket. He’s done wonders. But he\r\nwants you, George—he wants you. Sometimes he’s full of hope—talks of\r\nwhen we’re going to have a carriage and be in society—makes it seem so\r\nnatural and topsy-turvy, I hardly know whether my old heels aren’t up\r\nhere listening to him, and my old head on the floor.... Then he gets\r\ndepressed. Says he wants restraint. Says he can make a splash but can’t\r\nkeep on. Says if you don’t come in everything will smash—But you are\r\ncoming in?”\r\n\r\nShe paused and looked at me.\r\n\r\n“Well—”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say you won’t come in!”\r\n\r\n“But look here, aunt,” I said, “do you understand quite?... It’s a\r\nquack medicine. It’s trash.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no law against selling quack medicine that I know of,” said my\r\naunt. She thought for a minute and became unusually grave. “It’s our\r\nonly chance, George,” she said. “If it doesn’t go...”\r\n\r\nThere came the slamming of a door, and a loud bellowing from the next\r\napartment through the folding doors. “Here-er Shee _Rulk_ lies _Poo_\r\nTom Bo—oling.”\r\n\r\n“Silly old Concertina! Hark at him, George!” She raised her voice.\r\n“Don’t sing that, you old Walrus, you! Sing ‘I’m afloat!’”\r\n\r\nOne leaf of the folding doors opened and my uncle appeared.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, George! Come along at last? Gossome tea-cake, Susan?”\r\n\r\n“Thought it over George?” he said abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Coming in?”\r\n\r\nI paused for a last moment and nodded yes.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he cried. “Why couldn’t you say that a week ago?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve had false ideas about the world,” I said. “Oh! they don’t matter\r\nnow! Yes, I’ll come, I’ll take my chance with you, I won’t hesitate\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nAnd I didn’t. I stuck to that resolution for seven long years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\r\nHOW WE MADE TONO-BUNGAY HUM\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSo I made my peace with my uncle, and we set out upon this bright\r\nenterprise of selling slightly injurious rubbish at\r\none-and-three-halfpence and two-and-nine a bottle, including the\r\nGovernment stamp. We made Tono-Bungay hum! It brought us wealth,\r\ninfluence, respect, the confidence of endless people. All that my uncle\r\npromised me proved truth and understatement; Tono-Bungay carried me to\r\nfreedoms and powers that no life of scientific research, no passionate\r\nservice of humanity could ever have given me....\r\n\r\nIt was my uncle’s genius that did it. No doubt he needed me,—I was, I\r\nwill admit, his indispensable right hand; but his was the brain to\r\nconceive. He wrote every advertisement; some of them even he sketched.\r\nYou must remember that his were the days before the Time took to\r\nenterprise and the vociferous hawking of that antiquated\r\n_Encyclopædia_. That alluring, button-holing,\r\nlet-me-just-tell-you-quite-soberly-something-you-ought-to-know style of\r\nnewspaper advertisement, with every now and then a convulsive jump of\r\nsome attractive phrase into capitals, was then almost a novelty. “Many\r\npeople who are MODERATELY well think they are QUITE well,” was one of\r\nhis early efforts. The jerks in capitals were, “DO NOT NEED DRUGS OR\r\nMEDICINE,” and “SIMPLY A PROPER REGIMEN TO GET YOU IN TONE.” One was\r\nwarned against the chemist or druggist who pushed “much-advertised\r\nnostrums” on one’s attention. That trash did more harm than good. The\r\nthing needed was regimen—and Tono-Bungay!\r\n\r\nVery early, too, was that bright little quarter column, at least it was\r\nusually a quarter column in the evening papers: “HILARITY—Tono-Bungay.\r\nLike Mountain Air in the Veins.” The penetrating trio of questions:\r\n“Are you bored with your Business? Are you bored with your Dinner. Are\r\nyou bored with your Wife?”—that, too, was in our Gower Street days.\r\nBoth these we had in our first campaign when we worked London south\r\ncentral, and west; and then, too, we had our first poster—the HEALTH,\r\nBEAUTY, AND STRENGTH one. That was his design; I happen still to have\r\ngot by me the first sketch he made for it. I have reproduced it here\r\nwith one or two others to enable the reader to understand the mental\r\nquality that initiated these familiar ornaments of London.\r\n\r\n(The second one is about eighteen months later, the germ of the\r\nwell-known “Fog” poster; the third was designed for an influenza\r\nepidemic, but never issued.)\r\n\r\nThese things were only incidental in my department. I had to polish\r\nthem up for the artist and arrange the business of printing and\r\ndistribution, and after my uncle had had a violent and needless quarrel\r\nwith the advertising manager of the _Daily Regulator_ about the amount\r\nof display given to one of his happy thoughts, I also took up the\r\nnegotiations of advertisements for the press.\r\n\r\nWe discussed and worked out distribution together first in the\r\ndrawing-room floor in Gower Street with my aunt sometimes helping very\r\nshrewdly, and then, with a steadily improving type of cigar and older\r\nand older whisky, in his smuggery at their first house, the one in\r\nBeckenham. Often we worked far into the night sometimes until dawn.\r\n\r\nWe really worked infernally hard, and, I recall, we worked with a very\r\ndecided enthusiasm, not simply on my uncle’s part but mine, It was a\r\ngame, an absurd but absurdly interesting game, and the points were\r\nscored in cases of bottles. People think a happy notion is enough to\r\nmake a man rich, that fortunes can be made without toil. It’s a dream,\r\nas every millionaire (except one or two lucky gamblers) can testify; I\r\ndoubt if J.D. Rockefeller in the early days of Standard Oil, worked\r\nharder than we did. We worked far into the night—and we also worked all\r\nday. We made a rule to be always dropping in at the factory unannounced\r\nto keep things right—for at first we could afford no properly\r\nresponsible underlings—and we traveled London, pretending to be our own\r\nrepresentatives and making all sorts of special arrangements.\r\n\r\nBut none of this was my special work, and as soon as we could get other\r\nmen in, I dropped the traveling, though my uncle found it particularly\r\ninteresting and kept it up for years. “Does me good, George, to see the\r\nchaps behind their counters like I was once,” he explained. My special\r\nand distinctive duty was to give Tono-Bungay substance and an outward\r\nand visible bottle, to translate my uncle’s great imaginings into the\r\ncreation of case after case of labelled bottles of nonsense, and the\r\npunctual discharge of them by railway, road and steamer towards their\r\nultimate goal in the Great Stomach of the People. By all modern\r\nstandards the business was, as my uncle would say, “absolutely _bonâ\r\nfide_.” We sold our stuff and got the money, and spent the money\r\nhonestly in lies and clamour to sell more stuff. Section by section we\r\nspread it over the whole of the British Isles; first working the\r\nmiddle-class London suburbs, then the outer suburbs, then the home\r\ncounties, then going (with new bills and a more pious style of “ad”)\r\ninto Wales, a great field always for a new patent-medicine, and then\r\ninto Lancashire.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had in his inner office a big map of England, and as we took\r\nup fresh sections of the local press and our consignments invaded new\r\nareas, flags for advertisements and pink underlines for orders showed\r\nour progress.\r\n\r\n“The romance of modern commerce, George!” my uncle would say, rubbing\r\nhis hands together and drawing in air through his teeth. “The romance\r\nof modern commerce, eh? Conquest. Province by province. Like sogers.”\r\n\r\nWe subjugated England and Wales; we rolled over the Cheviots with a\r\nspecial adaptation containing eleven per cent. of absolute alcohol;\r\n“Tono-Bungay: Thistle Brand.” We also had the Fog poster adapted to a\r\nkilted Briton in a misty Highland scene.\r\n\r\nUnder the shadow of our great leading line we were presently taking\r\nsubsidiary specialties into action; “Tono-Bungay Hair Stimulant” was\r\nour first supplement. Then came “Concentrated Tono-Bungay” for the\r\neyes. That didn’t go, but we had a considerable success with the Hair\r\nStimulant. We broached the subject, I remember, in a little catechism\r\nbeginning: “Why does the hair fall out? Because the follicles are\r\nfagged. What are the follicles?...” So it went on to the climax that\r\nthe Hair Stimulant contained all “The essential principles of that most\r\nreviving tonic, Tono-Bungay, together with an emollient and nutritious\r\noil derived from crude Neat’s Foot Oil by a process of refinement,\r\nseparation and deodorization.... It will be manifest to any one of\r\nscientific attainments that in Neat’s Foot Oil derived from the hoofs\r\nand horns of beasts, we must necessarily have a natural skin and hair\r\nlubricant.”\r\n\r\nAnd we also did admirable things with our next subsidiaries,\r\n“Tono-Bungay Lozenges,” and “Tono-Bungay Chocolate.” These we urged\r\nupon the public for their extraordinary nutritive and recuperative\r\nvalue in cases of fatigue and strain. We gave them posters and\r\nillustrated advertisements showing climbers hanging from marvelously\r\nvertical cliffs, cyclist champions upon the track, mounted messengers\r\nengaged in Aix-to-Ghent rides, soldiers lying out in action under a hot\r\nsun. “You can GO for twenty-four hours,” we declared, “on Tono-Bungay\r\nChocolate.” We didn’t say whether you could return on the same\r\ncommodity. We also showed a dreadfully barristerish barrister, wig,\r\nside-whiskers, teeth, a horribly life-like portrait of all existing\r\nbarristers, talking at a table, and beneath, this legend: “A Four\r\nHours’ Speech on Tono-Bungay Lozenges, and as fresh as when he began.”\r\nThen brought in regiments of school-teachers, revivalist ministers,\r\npoliticians and the like. I really do believe there was an element of\r\n“kick” in the strychnine in these lozenges, especially in those made\r\naccording to our earlier formula. For we altered all our\r\nformulae—invariably weakening them enormously as sales got ahead.\r\n\r\nIn a little while—so it seems to me now—we were employing travelers and\r\nopening up Great Britain at the rate of a hundred square miles a day.\r\nAll the organisation throughout was sketched in a crude, entangled,\r\nhalf-inspired fashion by my uncle, and all of it had to be worked out\r\ninto a practicable scheme of quantities and expenditure by me. We had a\r\nlot of trouble finding our travelers; in the end at least half of them\r\nwere Irish-Americans, a wonderful breed for selling medicine. We had\r\nstill more trouble over our factory manager, because of the secrets of\r\nthe inner room, and in the end we got a very capable woman, Mrs.\r\nHampton Diggs, who had formerly managed a large millinery workroom,\r\nwhom we could trust to keep everything in good working order without\r\nfinding out anything that wasn’t put exactly under her loyal and\r\nenergetic nose. She conceived a high opinion of Tono-Bungay and took it\r\nin all forms and large quantities so long as I knew her. It didn’t seem\r\nto do her any harm. And she kept the girls going quite wonderfully.\r\n\r\nMy uncle’s last addition to the Tono-Bungay group was the Tono-Bungay\r\nMouthwash. The reader has probably read a hundred times that inspiring\r\ninquiry of his, “You are Young Yet, but are you Sure Nothing has Aged\r\nyour Gums?”\r\n\r\nAnd after that we took over the agency for three or four good American\r\nlines that worked in with our own, and could be handled with it; Texan\r\nEmbrocation, and “23—to clear the system” were the chief....\r\n\r\nI set down these bare facts. To me they are all linked with the figure\r\nof my uncle. In some of the old seventeenth and early eighteenth\r\ncentury prayerbooks at Bladesover there used to be illustrations with\r\nlong scrolls coming out of the mouths of the wood-cut figures. I wish I\r\ncould write all this last chapter on a scroll coming out of the head of\r\nmy uncle, show it all the time as unfolding and pouring out from a\r\nshort, fattening, small-legged man with stiff cropped hair, disobedient\r\nglasses on a perky little nose, and a round stare behind them. I wish I\r\ncould show you him breathing hard and a little through his nose as his\r\npen scrabbled out some absurd inspiration for a poster or a picture\r\npage, and make you hear his voice, charged with solemn import like the\r\nvoice of a squeaky prophet, saying, “George! list’n! I got an ideer. I\r\ngot a notion! George!”\r\n\r\nI should put myself into the same picture. Best setting for us, I\r\nthink, would be the Beckenham snuggery, because there we worked\r\nhardest. It would be the lamplit room of the early nineties, and the\r\nclock upon the mantel would indicate midnight or later. We would be\r\nsitting on either side of the fire, I with a pipe, my uncle with a\r\ncigar or cigarette. There would be glasses standing inside the brass\r\nfender. Our expressions would be very grave. My uncle used to sit right\r\nback in his armchair; his toes always turned in when he was sitting\r\ndown and his legs had a way of looking curved, as though they hadn’t\r\nbones or joints but were stuffed with sawdust.\r\n\r\n“George, whad’yer think of T.B. for sea-sickness?” he would say.\r\n\r\n“No good that I can imagine.”\r\n\r\n“Oom! No harm _trying_, George. We can but try.”\r\n\r\nI would suck my pipe. “Hard to get at. Unless we sold our stuff\r\nspecially at the docks. Might do a special at Cook’s office, or in the\r\nContinental Bradshaw.”\r\n\r\n“It ’ud give ’em confidence, George.”\r\n\r\nHe would Zzzz, with his glasses reflecting the red of the glowing\r\ncoals.\r\n\r\n“No good hiding our light under a Bushel,” he would remark.\r\n\r\nI never really determined whether my uncle regarded Tono-Bungay as a\r\nfraud, or whether he didn’t come to believe in it in a kind of way by\r\nthe mere reiteration of his own assertions. I think that his average\r\nattitude was one of kindly, almost parental, toleration. I remember\r\nsaying on one occasion, “But you don’t suppose this stuff ever did a\r\nhuman being the slightest good all?” and how his face assumed a look of\r\nprotest, as of one reproving harshness and dogmatism.\r\n\r\n“You’ve a hard nature, George,” he said. “You’re too ready to run\r\nthings down. How can one _tell?_ How can one venture to _tell?_...”\r\n\r\nI suppose any creative and developing game would have interested me in\r\nthose years. At any rate, I know I put as much zeal into this\r\nTono-Bungay as any young lieutenant could have done who suddenly found\r\nhimself in command of a ship. It was extraordinarily interesting to me\r\nto figure out the advantage accruing from this shortening of the\r\nprocess or that, and to weigh it against the capital cost of the\r\nalteration. I made a sort of machine for sticking on the labels, that I\r\npatented; to this day there is a little trickle of royalties to me from\r\nthat. I also contrived to have our mixture made concentrated, got the\r\nbottles, which all came sliding down a guarded slant-way, nearly filled\r\nwith distilled water at one tap, and dripped our magic ingredients in\r\nat the next. This was an immense economy of space for the inner\r\nsanctum. For the bottling we needed special taps, and these, too, I\r\ninvented and patented.\r\n\r\nWe had a sort of endless band of bottles sliding along an inclined\r\nglass trough made slippery with running water. At one end a girl held\r\nthem up to the light, put aside any that were imperfect and placed the\r\nothers in the trough; the filling was automatic; at the other end a\r\ngirl slipped in the cork and drove it home with a little mallet. Each\r\ntank, the little one for the vivifying ingredients and the big one for\r\ndistilled water, had a level indicator, and inside I had a float\r\narrangement that stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low.\r\nAnother girl stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles\r\nand hand them to the three packers, who slipped them into their outer\r\npapers and put them, with a pad of corrugated paper between each pair,\r\ninto a little groove from which they could be made to slide neatly into\r\nposition in our standard packing-case. It sounds wild, I know, but I\r\nbelieve I was the first man in the city of London to pack patent\r\nmedicines through the side of the packing-case, to discover there was a\r\nbetter way in than by the lid. Our cases packed themselves,\r\npractically; had only to be put into position on a little wheeled tray\r\nand when full pulled to the lift that dropped them to the men\r\ndownstairs, who padded up the free space and nailed on top and side.\r\nOur girls, moreover, packed with corrugated paper and matchbook-wood\r\nbox partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to\r\npack through the top of the box with straw, many breakages and much\r\nwaste and confusion.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAs I look back at them now, those energetic years seem all compacted to\r\na year or so; from the days of our first hazardous beginning in\r\nFarringdon Street with barely a thousand pounds’ worth of stuff or\r\ncredit all told—and that got by something perilously like snatching—to\r\nthe days when my uncle went to the public on behalf of himself and me\r\n(one-tenth share) and our silent partners, the drug wholesalers and the\r\nprinting people and the owner of that group of magazines and\r\nnewspapers, to ask with honest confidence for £150,000. Those silent\r\npartners were remarkably sorry, I know, that they had not taken larger\r\nshares and given us longer credit when the subscriptions came pouring\r\nin. My uncle had a clear half to play with (including the one-tenth\r\nunderstood to be mine).\r\n\r\n£150,000—think of it!—for the goodwill in a string of lies and a trade\r\nin bottles of mitigated water! Do you realise the madness of the world\r\nthat sanctions such a thing? Perhaps you don’t. At times use and wont\r\ncertainly blinded me. If it had not been for Ewart, I don’t think I\r\nshould have had an inkling of the wonderfulness of this development of\r\nmy fortunes; I should have grown accustomed to it, fallen in with all\r\nits delusions as completely as my uncle presently did. He was immensely\r\nproud of the flotation. “They’ve never been given such value,” he said,\r\n“for a dozen years.” But Ewart, with his gesticulating hairy hands and\r\nbony wrists, his single-handed chorus to all this as it played itself\r\nover again in my memory, and he kept my fundamental absurdity\r\nilluminated for me during all this astonishing time.\r\n\r\n“It’s just on all fours with the rest of things,” he remarked; “only\r\nmore so. You needn’t think you’re anything out of the way.”\r\n\r\nI remember one disquisition very distinctly. It was just after Ewart\r\nhad been to Paris on a mysterious expedition to “rough in” some work\r\nfor a rising American sculptor. This young man had a commission for an\r\nallegorical figure of Truth (draped, of course) for his State Capitol,\r\nand he needed help. Ewart had returned with his hair cut _en brosse_\r\nand with his costume completely translated into French. He wore, I\r\nremember, a bicycling suit of purplish-brown, baggy beyond ageing—the\r\nonly creditable thing about it was that it had evidently not been made\r\nfor him—a voluminous black tie, a decadent soft felt hat and several\r\nFrench expletives of a sinister description. “Silly clothes, aren’t\r\nthey?” he said at the sight of my startled eye. “I don’t know why I\r\ngot’m. They seemed all right over there.”\r\n\r\nHe had come down to our Raggett Street place to discuss a benevolent\r\nproject of mine for a poster by him, and he scattered remarkable\r\ndiscourse over the heads (I hope it was over the heads) of our\r\nbottlers.\r\n\r\n“What I like about it all, Ponderevo, is its poetry.... That’s where we\r\nget the pull of the animals. No animal would ever run a factory like\r\nthis. Think!... One remembers the Beaver, of course. He might very\r\npossibly bottle things, but would he stick a label round ’em and sell\r\n’em? The Beaver is a dreamy fool, I’ll admit, him and his dams, but\r\nafter all there’s a sort of protection about ’em, a kind of muddy\r\npracticality! They prevent things getting at him. And it’s not your\r\npoetry only. It’s the poetry of the customer too. Poet answering to\r\npoet—soul to soul. Health, Strength and Beauty—in a bottle—the magic\r\nphiltre! Like a fairy tale....\r\n\r\n“Think of the people to whom your bottles of footle go! (I’m calling it\r\nfootle, Ponderevo, out of praise,” he said in parenthesis.)\r\n\r\n“Think of the little clerks and jaded women and overworked people.\r\nPeople overstrained with wanting to do, people overstrained with\r\nwanting to be.... People, in fact, overstrained.... The real trouble of\r\nlife, Ponderevo, isn’t that we exist—that’s a vulgar error; the real\r\ntrouble is that we _don’t_ really exist and we want to. That’s what\r\nthis—in the highest sense—just stands for! The hunger to be—for\r\nonce—really alive—to the finger tips!...\r\n\r\n“Nobody wants to do and be the things people are—nobody. YOU don’t want\r\nto preside over this—this bottling; I don’t want to wear these beastly\r\nclothes and be led about by you; nobody wants to keep on sticking\r\nlabels on silly bottles at so many farthings a gross. That isn’t\r\nexisting! That’s—sus—_substratum_. None of us want to be what we are,\r\nor to do what we do. Except as a sort of basis. What do we want? _You_\r\nknow. _I_ know. Nobody confesses. What we all want to be is something\r\nperpetually young and beautiful—young Joves—young Joves, Ponderevo”—his\r\nvoice became loud, harsh and declamatory—“pursuing coy half-willing\r\nnymphs through everlasting forests.”...\r\n\r\nThere was a just-perceptible listening hang in the work about us.\r\n\r\n“Come downstairs,” I interrupted, “we can talk better there.”\r\n\r\n“I can talk better here,” he answered.\r\n\r\nHe was just going on, but fortunately the implacable face of Mrs.\r\nHampton Diggs appeared down the aisle of bottling machines.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said, “I’ll come.”\r\n\r\nIn the little sanctum below, my uncle was taking a digestive pause\r\nafter his lunch and by no means alert. His presence sent Ewart back to\r\nthe theme of modern commerce, over the excellent cigar my uncle gave\r\nhim. He behaved with the elaborate deference due to a business magnate\r\nfrom an unknown man.\r\n\r\n“What I was pointing out to your nephew, sir,” said Ewart, putting both\r\nelbows on the table, “was the poetry of commerce. He doesn’t, you know,\r\nseem to see it at all.”\r\n\r\nMy uncle nodded brightly. “Whad I tell ’im,” he said round his cigar.\r\n\r\n“We are artists. You and I, sir, can talk, if you will permit me, as\r\none artist to another. It’s advertisement has—done it. Advertisement\r\nhas revolutionised trade and industry; it is going to revolutionise the\r\nworld. The old merchant used to tote about commodities; the new one\r\ncreates values. Doesn’t need to tote. He takes something that isn’t\r\nworth anything—or something that isn’t particularly worth anything—and\r\nhe makes it worth something. He takes mustard that is just like anybody\r\nelse’s mustard, and he goes about saying, shouting, singing, chalking\r\non walls, writing inside people’s books, putting it everywhere,\r\n‘Smith’s Mustard is the Best.’ And behold it is the best!”\r\n\r\n“True,” said my uncle, chubbily and with a dreamy sense of mysticism;\r\n“true!”\r\n\r\n“It’s just like an artist; he takes a lump of white marble on the verge\r\nof a lime-kiln, he chips it about, he makes—he makes a monument to\r\nhimself—and others—a monument the world will not willingly let die.\r\nTalking of mustard, sir, I was at Clapham Junction the other day, and\r\nall the banks are overgrown with horse radish that’s got loose from a\r\ngarden somewhere. You know what horseradish is—grows like\r\nwildfire—spreads—spreads. I stood at the end of the platform looking at\r\nthe stuff and thinking about it. ‘Like fame,’ I thought, ‘rank and wild\r\nwhere it isn’t wanted. Why don’t the really good things in life grow\r\nlike horseradish?’ I thought. My mind went off in a peculiar way it\r\ndoes from that to the idea that mustard costs a penny a tin—I bought\r\nsome the other day for a ham I had. It came into my head that it would\r\nbe ripping good business to use horseradish to adulterate mustard. I\r\nhad a sort of idea that I could plunge into business on that, get rich\r\nand come back to my own proper monumental art again. And then I said,\r\n‘But _why_ adulterate? I don’t like the idea of adulteration.’”\r\n\r\n“Shabby,” said my uncle, nodding his head. “Bound to get found out!”\r\n\r\n“And totally unnecessary, too! Why not do up a mixture—three-quarters\r\npounded horseradish and a quarter mustard—give it a fancy name—and sell\r\nit at twice the mustard price. See? I very nearly started the business\r\nstraight away, only something happened. My train came along.”\r\n\r\n“Jolly good ideer,” said my uncle. He looked at me. “That really is an\r\nideer, George,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Take shavin’s, again! You know that poem of Longfellow’s, sir, that\r\nsounds exactly like the first declension. What is it?—‘Marr’s a maker,\r\nmen say!’”\r\n\r\nMy uncle nodded and gurgled some quotation that died away.\r\n\r\n“Jolly good poem, George,” he said in an aside to me.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s about a carpenter and a poetic Victorian child, you know,\r\nand some shavin’s. The child made no end out of the shavin’s. So might\r\nyou. Powder ’em. They might be anything. Soak ’em in\r\njipper,—Xylo-tobacco! Powder’em and get a little tar and turpentinous\r\nsmell in,—wood-packing for hot baths—a Certain Cure for the scourge of\r\nInfluenza! There’s all these patent grain foods,—what Americans call\r\ncereals. I believe I’m right, sir, in saying they’re sawdust.”\r\n\r\n“No!” said my uncle, removing his cigar; “as far as I can find out it’s\r\nreally grain,—spoilt grain.... I’ve been going into that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there you are!” said Ewart. “Say it’s spoilt grain. It carried\r\nout my case just as well. Your modern commerce is no more buying and\r\nselling than sculpture. It’s mercy—it’s salvation. It’s rescue work! It\r\ntakes all sorts of fallen commodities by the hand and raises them. Cana\r\nisn’t in it. You turn water—into Tono-Bungay.”\r\n\r\n“Tono-Bungay’s all right,” said my uncle, suddenly grave. “We aren’t\r\ntalking of Tono-Bungay.”\r\n\r\n“Your nephew, sir, is hard; he wants everything to go to a sort of\r\npredestinated end; he’s a Calvinist of Commerce. Offer him a dustbin\r\nfull of stuff; he calls it refuse—passes by on the other side. Now\r\n_you_, sir you’d make cinders respect themselves.”\r\n\r\nMy uncle regarded him dubiously for a moment. But there was a touch of\r\nappreciation in his eye.\r\n\r\n“Might make ’em into a sort of sanitary brick,” he reflected over his\r\ncigar end.\r\n\r\n“Or a friable biscuit. Why _not?_ You might advertise: ‘Why are Birds\r\nso Bright? Because they digest their food perfectly! Why do they digest\r\ntheir food so perfectly? Because they have a gizzard! Why hasn’t man a\r\ngizzard? Because he can buy Ponderevo’s Asphalt Triturating, Friable\r\nBiscuit—Which is Better.’”\r\n\r\nHe delivered the last words in a shout, with his hairy hand flourished\r\nin the air....\r\n\r\n“Damn clever fellow,” said my uncle, after he had one. “I know a man\r\nwhen I see one. He’d do. But drunk, I should say. But that only makes\r\nsome chap brighter. If he WANTS to do that poster, he can. Zzzz. That\r\nideer of his about the horseradish. There’s something in that, George.\r\nI’m going to think over that....”\r\n\r\nI may say at once that my poster project came to nothing in the end,\r\nthough Ewart devoted an interesting week to the matter. He let his\r\nunfortunate disposition to irony run away with him. He produced a\r\npicture of two beavers with a subtle likeness, he said, to myself and\r\nmy uncle—the likeness to my uncle certainly wasn’t half bad—and they\r\nwere bottling rows and rows of Tono-Bungay, with the legend “Modern\r\ncommerce.” It certainly wouldn’t have sold a case, though he urged it\r\non me one cheerful evening on the ground that it would “arouse\r\ncuriosity.” In addition he produced a quite shocking study of my uncle,\r\nexcessively and needlessly nude, but, so far as I was able to judge, an\r\nadmirable likeness, engaged in feats of strength of a Gargantuan type\r\nbefore an audience of deboshed and shattered ladies. The legend,\r\n“Health, Beauty, Strength,” below, gave a needed point to his parody.\r\nThis he hung up in the studio over the oil shop, with a flap of brown\r\npaper; by way of a curtain over it to accentuate its libellous offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH\r\nMARION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAs I look back on those days in which we built up the great Tono-Bungay\r\nproperty out of human hope and credit for bottles and rent and\r\nprinting, I see my life as it were arranged in two parallel columns of\r\nunequal width, a wider, more diffused, eventful and various one which\r\ncontinually broadens out, the business side of my life, and a narrow,\r\ndarker and darkling one shot ever and again with a gleam of happiness,\r\nmy home-life with Marion. For, of course, I married Marion.\r\n\r\nI didn’t, as a matter of fact, marry her until a year after Tono-Bungay\r\nwas thoroughly afloat, and then only after conflicts and discussions of\r\na quite strenuous sort. By that time I was twenty-four. It seems the\r\nnext thing to childhood now. We were both in certain directions\r\nunusually ignorant and simple; we were temperamentally antagonistic,\r\nand we hadn’t—I don’t think we were capable of—an idea in common. She\r\nwas young and extraordinarily conventional—she seemed never to have an\r\nidea of her own but always the idea of her class—and I was young and\r\nsceptical, enterprising and passionate; the two links that held us\r\ntogether were the intense appeal her physical beauty had for me, and\r\nher appreciation of her importance in my thoughts. There can be no\r\ndoubt of my passion for her. In her I had discovered woman desired. The\r\nnights I have lain awake on account of her, writhing, biting my wrists\r\nin a fever of longing! ...\r\n\r\nI have told how I got myself a silk hat and black coat to please her on\r\nSunday—to the derision of some of my fellow-students who charged to\r\nmeet me, and how we became engaged. But that was only the beginning of\r\nour difference. To her that meant the beginning of a not unpleasant\r\nlittle secrecy, an occasional use of verbal endearments, perhaps even\r\nkisses. It was something to go on indefinitely, interfering in no way\r\nwith her gossiping spells of work at Smithie’s. To me it was a pledge\r\nto come together into the utmost intimacy of soul and body so soon as\r\nwe could contrive it....\r\n\r\nI don’t know if it will strike the reader that I am setting out to\r\ndiscuss the queer, unwise love relationship and my bungle of a marriage\r\nwith excessive solemnity. But to me it seems to reach out to vastly\r\nwider issues than our little personal affair. I’ve thought over my\r\nlife. In these last few years I’ve tried to get at least a little\r\nwisdom out of it. And in particular I’ve thought over this part of my\r\nlife. I’m enormously impressed by the ignorant, unguided way in which\r\nwe two entangled ourselves with each other. It seems to me the queerest\r\nthing in all this network of misunderstandings and misstatements and\r\nfaulty and ramshackle conventions which makes up our social order as\r\nthe individual meets it, that we should have come together so\r\naccidentally and so blindly. Because we were no more than samples of\r\nthe common fate. Love is not only the cardinal fact in the individual\r\nlife, but the most important concern of the community; after all, the\r\nway in which the young people of this generation pair off determines\r\nthe fate of the nation; all the other affairs of the State are\r\nsubsidiary to that. And we leave it to flushed and blundering youth to\r\nstumble on its own significance, with nothing to guide in but shocked\r\nlooks and sentimental twaddle and base whisperings and cant-smeared\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nI have tried to indicate something of my own sexual development in the\r\npreceding chapter. Nobody was ever frank and decent with me in this\r\nrelation; nobody, no book, ever came and said to me thus and thus is\r\nthe world made, and so and so is necessary. Everything came obscurely,\r\nindefinitely, perplexingly; and all I knew of law or convention in the\r\nmatter had the form of threatenings and prohibitions. Except through\r\nthe furtive, shameful talk of my coevals at Goudhurst and Wimblehurst,\r\nI was not even warned against quite horrible dangers. My ideas were\r\nmade partly of instinct, partly of a romantic imagination, partly woven\r\nout of a medley of scraps of suggestion that came to me haphazard. I\r\nhad read widely and confusedly “Vathek,” Shelley, Tom Paine, Plutarch,\r\nCarlyle, Haeckel, William Morris, the Bible, the _Freethinker_, the\r\n_Clarion_, “The Woman Who Did,”—I mention the ingredients that come\r\nfirst to mind. All sorts of ideas were jumbled up in me and never a\r\nlucid explanation. But it was evident to me that the world regarded\r\nShelley, for example, as a very heroic as well as beautiful person; and\r\nthat to defy convention and succumb magnificently to passion was the\r\nproper thing to do to gain the respect and affection of all decent\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAnd the make-up of Marion’s mind in the matter was an equally\r\nirrational affair. Her training had been one, not simply of silences,\r\nbut suppressions. An enormous force of suggestion had so shaped her\r\nthat the intense natural fastidiousness of girlhood had developed into\r\nan absolute perversion of instinct. For all that is cardinal in this\r\nessential business of life she had one inseparable epithet—“horrid.”\r\nWithout any such training she would have been a shy lover, but now she\r\nwas an impossible one. For the rest she had derived, I suppose, partly\r\nfrom the sort of fiction she got from the Public Library, and partly\r\nfrom the workroom talk at Smithie’s. So far as the former origin went,\r\nshe had an idea of love as a state of worship and service on the part\r\nof the man and of condescension on the part of the woman. There was\r\nnothing “horrid” about it in any fiction she had read. The man gave\r\npresents, did services, sought to be in every way delightful. The woman\r\n“went out” with him, smiled at him, was kissed by him in decorous\r\nsecrecy, and if he chanced to offend, denied her countenance and\r\npresence. Usually she did something “for his good” to him, made him go\r\nto church, made him give up smoking or gambling, smartened him up.\r\nQuite at the end of the story came a marriage, and after that the\r\ninterest ceased.\r\n\r\nThat was the tenor of Marion’s fiction; but I think the work-table\r\nconversation at Smithie’s did something to modify that. At Smithie’s it\r\nwas recognised, I think, that a “fellow” was a possession to be\r\ndesired; that it was better to be engaged to a fellow than not; that\r\nfellows had to be kept—they might be mislaid, they might even be\r\nstolen. There was a case of stealing at Smithie’s, and many tears.\r\n\r\nSmithie I met before we were married, and afterwards she became a\r\nfrequent visitor to our house at Ealing. She was a thin, bright-eyed,\r\nhawk-nosed girl of thirtyodd, with prominent teeth, a high-pitched,\r\neager voice and a disposition to be urgently smart in her dress. Her\r\nhats were startling and various, but invariably disconcerting, and she\r\ntalked in a rapid, nervous flow that was hilarious rather than witty,\r\nand broken by little screams of “Oh, my _dear!_” and “you never did!”\r\nShe was the first woman I ever met who used scent. Poor old Smithie!\r\nWhat a harmless, kindly soul she really was, and how heartily I\r\ndetested her! Out of the profits on the Persian robes she supported a\r\nsister’s family of three children, she “helped” a worthless brother,\r\nand overflowed in help even to her workgirls, but that didn’t weigh\r\nwith me in those youthfully-narrow times. It was one of the intense\r\nminor irritations of my married life that Smithie’s whirlwind chatter\r\nseemed to me to have far more influence with Marion than anything I had\r\nto say. Before all things I coveted her grip upon Marion’s inaccessible\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIn the workroom at Smithie’s, I gathered, they always spoke of me\r\ndemurely as “A Certain Person.” I was rumoured to be dreadfully\r\n“clever,” and there were doubts—not altogether without justification—of\r\nthe sweetness of my temper.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWell, these general explanations will enable the reader to understand\r\nthe distressful times we two had together when presently I began to\r\nfeel on a footing with Marion and to fumble conversationally for the\r\nmind and the wonderful passion I felt, obstinately and stupidity, must\r\nbe in her. I think she thought me the maddest of sane men; “clever,” in\r\nfact, which at Smithie’s was, I suppose, the next thing to insanity, a\r\nword intimating incomprehensible and incalculable motives.... She could\r\nbe shocked at anything, she misunderstood everything, and her weapon\r\nwas a sulky silence that knitted her brows, spoilt her mouth and robbed\r\nher face of beauty. “Well, if we can’t agree, I don’t see why you\r\nshould go on talking,” she used to say. That would always enrage me\r\nbeyond measure. Or, “I’m afraid I’m not clever enough to understand\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nSilly little people! I see it all now, but then I was no older than she\r\nand I couldn’t see anything but that Marion, for some inexplicable\r\nreason, wouldn’t come alive.\r\n\r\nWe would contrive semi-surreptitious walks on Sunday, and part\r\nspeechless with the anger of indefinable offences. Poor Marion! The\r\nthings I tried to put before her, my fermenting ideas about theology,\r\nabout Socialism, about aesthetics—the very words appalled her, gave her\r\nthe faint chill of approaching impropriety, the terror of a very\r\npresent intellectual impossibility. Then by an enormous effort I would\r\nsuppress myself for a time and continue a talk that made her happy,\r\nabout Smithie’s brother, about the new girl who had come to the\r\nworkroom, about the house we would presently live in. But there we\r\ndiffered a little. I wanted to be accessible to St. Paul’s or Cannon\r\nStreet Station, and she had set her mind quite resolutely upon\r\nEaling.... It wasn’t by any means quarreling all the time, you\r\nunderstand. She liked me to play the lover “nicely”; she liked the\r\neffect of going about—we had lunches, we went to Earl’s Court, to Kew,\r\nto theatres and concerts, but not often to concerts, because, though\r\nMarion “liked” music, she didn’t like “too much of it,” to picture\r\nshows—and there was a nonsensical sort of babytalk I picked up—I forget\r\nwhere now—that became a mighty peacemaker.\r\n\r\nHer worst offence for me was an occasional excursion into the Smithie\r\nstyle of dressing, debased West Kensington. For she had no sense at all\r\nof her own beauty. She had no comprehension whatever of beauty of the\r\nbody, and she could slash her beautiful lines to rags with hat-brims\r\nand trimmings. Thank Heaven! a natural refinement, a natural timidity,\r\nand her extremely slender purse kept her from the real Smithie\r\nefflorescence! Poor, simple, beautiful, kindly limited Marion! Now that\r\nI am forty-five, I can look back at her with all my old admiration and\r\nnone of my old bitterness with a new affection and not a scrap of\r\npassion, and take her part against the equally stupid,\r\ndrivingly-energetic, sensuous, intellectual sprawl I used to be. I was\r\na young beast for her to have married—a hound beast. With her it was my\r\nbusiness to understand and control—and I exacted fellowship,\r\npassion....\r\n\r\nWe became engaged, as I have told; we broke it off and joined again. We\r\nwent through a succession of such phases. We had no sort of idea what\r\nwas wrong with us. Presently we were formally engaged. I had a\r\nwonderful interview with her father, in which he was stupendously grave\r\nand _h_—less, wanted to know about my origins and was tolerant\r\n(exasperatingly tolerant) because my mother was a servant, and\r\nafterwards her mother took to kissing me, and I bought a ring. But the\r\nspeechless aunt, I gathered, didn’t approve—having doubts of my\r\nreligiosity. Whenever we were estranged we could keep apart for days;\r\nand to begin with, every such separation was a relief. And then I would\r\nwant her; a restless longing would come upon me. I would think of the\r\nflow of her arms, of the soft, gracious bend of her body. I would lie\r\nawake or dream of a transfigured Marion of light and fire. It was\r\nindeed Dame Nature driving me on to womankind in her stupid, inexorable\r\nway; but I thought it was the need of Marion that troubled me. So I\r\nalways went back to Marion at last and made it up and more or less\r\nconceded or ignored whatever thing had parted us, and more and more I\r\nurged her to marry me....\r\n\r\nIn the long run that became a fixed idea. It entangled my will and my\r\npride; I told myself I was not going to be beaten. I hardened to the\r\nbusiness. I think, as a matter of fact, my real passion for Marion had\r\nwaned enormously long before we were married, that she had lived it\r\ndown by sheer irresponsiveness. When I felt sure of my three hundred a\r\nyear she stipulated for delay, twelve months’ delay, “to see how things\r\nwould turn out.” There were times when she seemed simply an antagonist\r\nholding out irritatingly against something I had to settle. Moreover, I\r\nbegan to be greatly distracted by the interest and excitement of\r\nTono-Bungay’s success, by the change and movement in things, the going\r\nto and fro. I would forget her for days together, and then desire her\r\nwith an irritating intensity at last, one Saturday afternoon, after a\r\nbrooding morning, I determined almost savagely that these delays must\r\nend.\r\n\r\nI went off to the little home at Walham Green, and made Marion come\r\nwith me to Putney Common. Marion wasn’t at home when I got there and I\r\nhad to fret for a time and talk to her father, who was just back from\r\nhis office, he explained, and enjoying himself in his own way in the\r\ngreenhouse.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to ask your daughter to marry me!” I said. “I think we’ve\r\nbeen waiting long enough.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t approve of long engagements either,” said her father. “But\r\nMarion will have her own way about it, anyhow. Seen this new powdered\r\nfertiliser?”\r\n\r\nI went in to talk to Mrs. Ramboat. “She’ll want time to get her\r\nthings,” said Mrs. Ramboat....\r\n\r\nI and Marion sat down together on a little seat under some trees at the\r\ntop of Putney Hill, and I came to my point abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Marion,” I said, “are you going to marry me or are you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled at me. “Well,” she said, “we’re engaged—aren’t we?”\r\n\r\n“That can’t go on for ever. Will you marry me next week?”\r\n\r\nShe looked me in the face. “We can’t,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You promised to marry me when I had three hundred a year.”\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a space. “Can’t we go on for a time as we are? We\r\n_could_ marry on three hundred a year. But it means a very little\r\nhouse. There’s Smithie’s brother. They manage on two hundred and fifty,\r\nbut that’s very little. She says they have a semi-detached house almost\r\non the road, and hardly a bit of garden. And the wall to next-door is\r\nso thin they hear everything. When her baby cries—they rap. And people\r\nstand against the railings and talk.... Can’t we wait? You’re doing so\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary bitterness possessed me at this invasion of the\r\nstupendous beautiful business of love by sordid necessity. I answered\r\nher with immense restraint.\r\n\r\n“If,” I said, “we could have a double-fronted, detached house—at\r\nEaling, say—with a square patch of lawn in front and a garden\r\nbehind—and—and a tiled bathroom.”\r\n\r\n“That would be sixty pounds a year at least.”\r\n\r\n“Which means five hundred a year.... Yes, well, you see, I told my\r\nuncle I wanted that, and I’ve got it.”\r\n\r\n“Got what?”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred pounds a year.”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred pounds!”\r\n\r\nI burst into laughter that had more than a taste of bitterness.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “really! and _now_ what do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, a little flushed; “but be sensible! Do you really mean\r\nyou’ve got a Rise, all at once, of two hundred a year?”\r\n\r\n“To marry on—yes.”\r\n\r\nShe scrutinised me a moment. “You’ve done this as a surprise!” she\r\nsaid, and laughed at my laughter. She had become radiant, and that made\r\nme radiant, too.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “yes,” and laughed no longer bitterly.\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands and looked me in the eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was so pleased that I forgot absolutely my disgust of a moment\r\nbefore. I forgot that she had raised her price two hundred pounds a\r\nyear and that I had bought her at that.\r\n\r\n“Come!” I said, standing up; “let’s go towards the sunset, dear, and\r\ntalk about it all. Do you know—this is a most beautiful world, an\r\namazingly beautiful world, and when the sunset falls upon you it makes\r\nyou into shining gold. No, not gold—into golden glass.... Into\r\nsomething better that either glass or gold.”...\r\n\r\nAnd for all that evening I wooed her and kept her glad. She made me\r\nrepeat my assurances over again and still doubted a little.\r\n\r\nWe furnished that double-fronted house from attic—it ran to an attic—to\r\ncellar, and created a garden.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Pampas Grass?” said Marion. “I love Pampas Grass... if\r\nthere is room.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have Pampas Grass,” I declared. And there were moments as we\r\nwent in imagination about that house together, when my whole being\r\ncried out to take her in my arms—now. But I refrained. On that aspect\r\nof life I touched very lightly in that talk, very lightly because I had\r\nhad my lessons. She promised to marry me within two months’ time.\r\nShyly, reluctantly, she named a day, and next afternoon, in heat and\r\nwrath, we “broke it off” again for the last time. We split upon\r\nprocedure. I refused flatly to have a normal wedding with wedding cake,\r\nin white favours, carriages and the rest of it. It dawned upon me\r\nsuddenly in conversation with her and her mother, that this was\r\nimplied. I blurted out my objection forthwith, and this time it wasn’t\r\nany ordinary difference of opinion; it was a “row.” I don’t remember a\r\nquarter of the things we flung out in that dispute. I remember her\r\nmother reiterating in tones of gentle remonstrance: “But, George dear,\r\nyou _must_ have a cake—to send home.” I think we all reiterated things.\r\nI seem to remember a refrain of my own: “A marriage is too sacred a\r\nthing, too private a thing, for this display. Her father came in and\r\nstood behind me against the wall, and her aunt appeared beside the\r\nsideboard and stood with arms, looking from speaker to speaker, a\r\nsternly gratified prophetess. It didn’t occur to me then! How painful\r\nit was to Marion for these people to witness my rebellion.\r\n\r\n“But, George,” said her father, “what sort of marriage do you want? You\r\ndon’t want to go to one of those there registry offices?”\r\n\r\n“That’s exactly what I’d like to do. Marriage is too private a thing—”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t feel married,” said Mrs. Ramboat.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Marion,” I said; “we are going to be married at a registry\r\noffice. I don’t believe in all these fripperies and superstitions, and\r\nI won’t submit to them. I’ve agreed to all sorts of things to please\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“What’s he agreed to?” said her father—unheeded.\r\n\r\n“I can’t marry at a registry office,” said Marion, sallow-white.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said. “I’ll marry nowhere else.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t marry at a registry office.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said, standing up, white and tense and it amazed me, but\r\nI was also exultant; “then we won’t marry at all.”\r\n\r\nShe leant forward over the table, staring blankly. But presently her\r\nhalf-averted face began to haunt me as she had sat at the table, and\r\nher arm and the long droop of her shoulder.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe next day I did an unexampled thing. I sent a telegram to my uncle,\r\n“_Bad temper not coming to business_,” and set off for Highgate and\r\nEwart. He was actually at work—on a bust of Millie, and seemed very\r\nglad for any interruption.\r\n\r\n“Ewart, you old Fool,” I said, “knock off and come for a day’s gossip.\r\nI’m rotten. There’s a sympathetic sort of lunacy about you. Let’s go to\r\nStaines and paddle up to Windsor.”\r\n\r\n“Girl?” said Ewart, putting down a chisel.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThat was all I told him of my affair.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got no money,” he remarked, to clear up ambiguity in my\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nWe got a jar of shandy-gaff, some food, and, on Ewart’s suggestion, two\r\nJapanese sunshades in Staines; we demanded extra cushions at the\r\nboathouse and we spent an enormously soothing day in discourse and\r\nmeditation, our boat moored in a shady place this side of Windsor. I\r\nseem to remember Ewart with a cushion forward, only his heels and\r\nsunshade and some black ends of hair showing, a voice and no more,\r\nagainst the shining, smoothly-streaming mirror of the trees and bushes.\r\n\r\n“It’s not worth it,” was the burthen of the voice. “You’d better get\r\nyourself a Millie, Ponderevo, and then you wouldn’t feel so upset.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said decidedly, “that’s not my way.”\r\n\r\nA thread of smoke ascended from Ewart for a while, like smoke from an\r\naltar.\r\n\r\n“Everything’s a muddle, and you think it isn’t. Nobody knows where we\r\nare—because, as a matter of fact we aren’t anywhere. Are women\r\nproperty—or are they fellow-creatures? Or a sort of proprietary\r\ngoddesses? They’re so obviously fellow-creatures. You believe in the\r\ngoddess?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “that’s not my idea.”\r\n\r\n“What is your idea?”\r\n\r\n“Well”\r\n\r\n“H’m,” said Ewart, in my pause.\r\n\r\n“My idea,” I said, “is to meet one person who will belong to me—to whom\r\nI shall belong—body and soul. No half-gods! Wait till she comes. If she\r\ncomes at all.... We must come to each other young and pure.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no such thing as a pure person or an impure person.... Mixed\r\nto begin with.”\r\n\r\nThis was so manifestly true that it silenced me altogether.\r\n\r\n“And if you belong to her and she to you, Ponderevo—which end’s the\r\nhead?”\r\n\r\nI made no answer except an impatient “oh!”\r\n\r\nFor a time we smoked in silence....\r\n\r\n“Did I tell you, Ponderevo, of a wonderful discovery I’ve made?” Ewart\r\nbegan presently.\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “what is it?”\r\n\r\n“There’s no Mrs. Grundy.”\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“No! Practically not. I’ve just thought all that business out. She’s\r\nmerely an instrument, Ponderevo. She’s borne the blame. Grundy’s a man.\r\nGrundy unmasked. Rather lean and out of sorts. Early middle age. With\r\nbunchy black whiskers and a worried eye. Been good so far, and it’s\r\nfretting him! Moods! There’s Grundy in a state of sexual panic, for\r\nexample,—‘For God’s sake cover it up! They get together—they get\r\ntogether! It’s too exciting! The most dreadful things are happening!’\r\nRushing about—long arms going like a windmill. ‘They must be kept\r\napart!’ Starts out for an absolute obliteration of everything absolute\r\nseparations. One side of the road for men, and the other for women, and\r\na hoarding—without posters between them. Every boy and girl to be sewed\r\nup in a sack and sealed, just the head and hands and feet out until\r\ntwenty-one. Music abolished, calico garments for the lower animals!\r\nSparrows to be suppressed—ab-so-lutely.”\r\n\r\nI laughed abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s Mr. Grundy in one mood—and it puts Mrs. Grundy—She’s a\r\nmuch-maligned person, Ponderevo—a rake at heart—and it puts her in a\r\nmost painful state of fluster—most painful! She’s an amenable creature.\r\nWhen Grundy tells her things are shocking, she’s shocked—pink and\r\nbreathless. She goes about trying to conceal her profound sense of\r\nguilt behind a haughty expression....\r\n\r\n“Grundy, meanwhile, is in a state of complete whirlabout. Long lean\r\nknuckly hands pointing and gesticulating! ‘They’re still thinking of\r\nthings—thinking of things! It’s dreadful. They get it out of books. I\r\ncan’t imagine where they get it! I must watch! There’re people over\r\nthere whispering! Nobody ought to whisper!—There’s something suggestive\r\nin the mere act! Then, pictures! In the museum—things too dreadful for\r\nwords. Why can’t we have pure art—with the anatomy all wrong and pure\r\nand nice—and pure fiction pure poetry, instead of all this stuff with\r\nallusions—allusions?... Excuse me! There’s something up behind that\r\nlocked door! The keyhole! In the interests of public morality—yes, Sir,\r\nas a pure good man—I insist—_I’ll_ look—it won’t hurt me—I insist on\r\nlooking my duty—M’m’m—the keyhole!’”\r\n\r\nHe kicked his legs about extravagantly, and I laughed again.\r\n\r\n“That’s Grundy in one mood, Ponderevo. It isn’t Mrs. Grundy. That’s one\r\nof the lies we tell about women. They’re too simple. Simple! Woman ARE\r\nsimple! They take on just what men tell ’em.”\r\n\r\nEwart meditated for a space. “Just exactly as it’s put to them,” he\r\nsaid, and resumed the moods of Mr. Grundy.\r\n\r\n“Then you get old Grundy in another mood. Ever caught him nosing,\r\nPonderevo? Mad with the idea of mysterious, unknown, wicked, delicious\r\nthings. Things that aren’t respectable. Wow! Things he mustn’t do!...\r\nAny one who knows about these things, knows there’s just as much\r\nmystery and deliciousness about Grundy’s forbidden things as there is\r\nabout eating ham. Jolly nice if it’s a bright morning and you’re well\r\nand hungry and having breakfast in the open air. Jolly unattractive if\r\nyou’re off colour. But Grundy’s covered it all up and hidden it and put\r\nmucky shades and covers over it until he’s forgotten it. Begins to\r\nfester round it in his mind. Has dreadful struggles—with himself about\r\nimpure thoughts.... Then you set Grundy with hot ears,—curious in\r\nundertones. Grundy on the loose, Grundy in a hoarse whisper and with\r\nfurtive eyes and convulsive movements—making things indecent.\r\nEvolving—in dense vapours—indecency!\r\n\r\n“Grundy sins. Oh, yes, he’s a hypocrite. Sneaks round a corner and sins\r\nugly. It’s Grundy and his dark corners that make vice, vice! We\r\nartists—we have no vices.\r\n\r\n“And then he’s frantic with repentance. And wants to be cruel to fallen\r\nwomen and decent harmless sculptors of the simple nude—like me—and so\r\nback to his panic again.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Grundy, I suppose, doesn’t know he sins,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“No? I’m not so sure.... But, bless her heart she’s a woman.... She’s a\r\nwoman. Then again you get Grundy with a large greasy smile—like an\r\naccident to a butter tub—all over his face, being Liberal Minded—Grundy\r\nin his Anti-Puritan moments, ‘trying not to see Harm in it’—Grundy the\r\nfriend of innocent pleasure. He makes you sick with the Harm he’s\r\ntrying not to see in it...\r\n\r\n“And that’s why everything’s wrong, Ponderevo. Grundy, damn him! stands\r\nin the light, and we young people can’t see. His moods affect us. We\r\ncatch his gusts of panic, his disease of nosing, his greasiness. We\r\ndon’t know what we may think, what we may say, he does his silly utmost\r\nto prevent our reading and seeing the one thing, the one sort of\r\ndiscussion we find—quite naturally and properly—supremely interesting.\r\nSo we don’t adolescence; we blunder up to sex. Dare—dare to look—and he\r\nmay dirt you for ever! The girls are terror-stricken to silence by his\r\nsignificant whiskers, by the bleary something in his eyes.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ewart, with an almost Jack-in-the-box effect, sat up.\r\n\r\n“He’s about us everywhere, Ponderevo,” he said, very solemnly.\r\n“Sometimes—sometimes I think he is—in our blood. In _mine_.”\r\n\r\nHe regarded me for my opinion very earnestly, with his pipe in the\r\ncorner of his mouth.\r\n\r\n“You’re the remotest cousin he ever had,” I said.\r\n\r\nI reflected. “Look here, Ewart,” I asked, “how would you have things\r\ndifferent?”\r\n\r\nHe wrinkled up his queer face, regarded the wait and made his pipe\r\ngurgle for a space, thinking deeply.\r\n\r\n“There are complications, I admit. We’ve grown up under the terror of\r\nGrundy and that innocent but docile and—yes—formidable lady, his wife.\r\nI don’t know how far the complications aren’t a disease, a sort of\r\nbleaching under the Grundy shadow.... It is possible there are things I\r\nhave still to learn about women.... Man has eaten of the Tree of\r\nKnowledge. His innocence is gone. You can’t have your cake and eat it.\r\nWe’re in for knowledge; let’s have it plain and straight. I should\r\nbegin, I think, by abolishing the ideas of decency and indecency....”\r\n\r\n“Grundy would have fits!” I injected.\r\n\r\n“Grundy, Ponderevo, would have cold douches—publicly—if the sight was\r\nnot too painful—three times a day.... But I don’t think, mind you, that\r\nI should let the sexes run about together. No. The fact behind the\r\nsexes—is sex. It’s no good humbugging. It trails about—even in the best\r\nmixed company. Tugs at your ankle. The men get showing off and\r\nquarrelling—and the women. Or they’re bored. I suppose the ancestral\r\nmales have competed for the ancestral females ever since they were both\r\nsome sort of grubby little reptile. You aren’t going to alter that in a\r\nthousand years or so.... Never should you have a mixed company,\r\nnever—except with only one man or only one woman. How would that be?...\r\n\r\n“Or duets only?...\r\n\r\n“How to manage it? Some rule of etiquette, perhaps.”... He became\r\nportentously grave.\r\n\r\nThen his long hand went out in weird gestures.\r\n\r\n“I seem to see—I seem to see—a sort of City of Women, Ponderevo.\r\nYes.... A walled enclosure—good stone-mason’s work—a city wall, high as\r\nthe walls of Rome, going about a garden. Dozens of square miles of\r\ngarden—trees—fountains—arbours—lakes. Lawns on which the women play,\r\navenues in which they gossip, boats.... Women like that sort of thing.\r\nAny woman who’s been to a good eventful girls’ school lives on the\r\nmemory of it for the rest of her life. It’s one of the pathetic things\r\nabout women—the superiority of school and college—to anything they get\r\nafterwards. And this city-garden of women will have beautiful places\r\nfor music, places for beautiful dresses, places for beautiful work.\r\nEverything a woman can want. Nurseries. Kindergartens. Schools. And no\r\nman—except to do rough work, perhaps—ever comes in. The men live in a\r\nworld where they can hunt and engineer, invent and mine and\r\nmanufacture, sail ships, drink deep and practice the arts, and fight—”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “but—”\r\n\r\nHe stilled me with a gesture.\r\n\r\n“I’m coming to that. The homes of the women, Ponderevo, will be set in\r\nthe wall of their city; each woman will have her own particular house\r\nand home, furnished after her own heart in her own manner—with a little\r\nbalcony on the outside wall. Built into the wall—and a little balcony.\r\nAnd there she will go and look out, when the mood takes her, and all\r\nround the city there will be a broad road and seats and great shady\r\ntrees. And men will stroll up and down there when they feel the need of\r\nfeminine company; when, for instance, they want to talk about their\r\nsouls or their characters or any of the things that only women will\r\nstand.... The women will lean over and look at the men and smile and\r\ntalk to them as they fancy. And each woman will have this; she will\r\nhave a little silken ladder she can let down if she chooses—if she\r\nwants to talk closer...”\r\n\r\n“The men would still be competing.”\r\n\r\n“There perhaps—yes. But they’d have to abide by the women’s decisions.”\r\n\r\nI raised one or two difficulties, and for a while we played with this\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n“Ewart,” I said, “this is like Doll’s Island.\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” I reflected, “an unsuccessful man laid siege to a balcony\r\nand wouldn’t let his rival come near it?”\r\n\r\n“Move him on,” said Ewart, “by a special regulation. As one does\r\norgan-grinders. No difficulty about that. And you could forbid it—make\r\nit against the etiquette. No life is decent without etiquette.... And\r\npeople obey etiquette sooner than laws...”\r\n\r\n“H’m,” I said, and was struck by an idea that is remote in the world of\r\na young man. “How about children?” I asked; “in the City? Girls are all\r\nvery well. But boys, for example—grow up.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Ewart. “Yes. I forgot. They mustn’t grow up inside....\r\nThey’d turn out the boys when they were seven. The father must come\r\nwith a little pony and a little gun and manly wear, and take the boy\r\naway. Then one could come afterwards to one’s mother’s balcony.... It\r\nmust be fine to have a mother. The father and the son...”\r\n\r\n“This is all very pretty in its way,” I said at last, “but it’s a\r\ndream. Let’s come back to reality. What I want to know is, what are you\r\ngoing to do in Brompton, let us say, or Walham Green _now?_”\r\n\r\n“Oh! damn it!” he remarked, “Walham Green! What a chap you are,\r\nPonderevo!” and he made an abrupt end to his discourse. He wouldn’t\r\neven reply to my tentatives for a time.\r\n\r\n“While I was talking just now,” he remarked presently,\r\n\r\n“I had a quite different idea.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“For a masterpiece. A series. Like the busts of the Cæsars. Only not\r\nheads, you know. We don’t see the people who do things to us\r\nnowadays...”\r\n\r\n“How will you do it, then?”\r\n\r\n“Hands—a series of hands! The hands of the Twentieth Century. I’ll do\r\nit. Some day some one will discover it—go there—see what I have done,\r\nand what is meant by it.”\r\n\r\n“See it where?”\r\n\r\n“On the tombs. Why not? The Unknown Master of the Highgate Slope! All\r\nthe little, soft feminine hands, the nervous ugly males, the hands of\r\nthe flops, and the hands of the snatchers! And Grundy’s loose, lean,\r\nknuckly affair—Grundy the terror!—the little wrinkles and the thumb!\r\nOnly it ought to hold all the others together—in a slightly disturbing\r\nsqueeze....Like Rodin’s great Hand—you know the thing!”\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI forget how many days intervened between that last breaking off of our\r\nengagement and Marion’s surrender. But I recall now the sharpness of my\r\nemotion, the concentrated spirit of tears and laughter in my throat as\r\nI read the words of her unexpected letter—“I have thought over\r\neverything, and I was selfish....” I rushed off to Walham Green that\r\nevening to give back all she had given me, to beat her altogether at\r\ngiving. She was extraordinarily gentle and generous that time, I\r\nremember, and when at last I left her, she kissed me very sweetly.\r\n\r\nSo we were married.\r\n\r\nWe were married with all the customary incongruity. I gave—perhaps\r\nafter a while not altogether ungrudgingly—and what I gave, Marion took,\r\nwith a manifest satisfaction. After all, I was being sensible. So that\r\nwe had three livery carriages to the church (one of the pairs of horses\r\nmatched) and coachmen—with improvised flavour and very shabby silk\r\nhats—bearing white favours on their whips, and my uncle intervened with\r\nsplendour and insisted upon having a wedding breakfast sent in from a\r\ncaterer’s in Hammersmith. The table had a great display of\r\nchrysanthemums, and there was orange blossom in the significant place\r\nand a wonderful cake. We also circulated upwards of a score of wedges\r\nof that accompanied by silver-printed cards in which Marion’s name of\r\nRamboat was stricken out by an arrow in favour of Ponderevo. We had a\r\nlittle rally of Marion’s relations, and several friends and friends’\r\nfriends from Smithie’s appeared in the church and drifted vestry-ward.\r\nI produced my aunt and uncle a select group of two. The effect in that\r\nshabby little house was one of exhilarating congestion. The side-board,\r\nin which lived the table-cloth and the “Apartments” card, was used for\r\na display of the presents, eked out by the unused balance of the\r\nsilver-printed cards.\r\n\r\nMarion wore the white raiment of a bride, white silk and satin, that\r\ndid not suit her, that made her seem large and strange to me; she\r\nobtruded bows and unfamiliar contours. She went through all this\r\nstrange ritual of an English wedding with a sacramental gravity that I\r\nwas altogether too young and egotistical to comprehend. It was all\r\nextraordinarily central and important to her; it was no more than an\r\noffensive, complicated, and disconcerting intrusion of a world I was\r\nalready beginning to criticise very bitterly, to me. What was all this\r\nfuss for? The mere indecent advertisement that I had been passionately\r\nin love with Marion! I think, however, that Marion was only very\r\nremotely aware of my smouldering exasperation at having in the end\r\nbehaved “nicely.” I had played—up to the extent of dressing my part; I\r\nhad an admirably cut frock—coat, a new silk hat, trousers as light as I\r\ncould endure them—lighter, in fact—a white waistcoat, night tie, light\r\ngloves. Marion, seeing me despondent had the unusual enterprise to\r\nwhisper to me that I looked lovely; I knew too well I didn’t look\r\nmyself. I looked like a special coloured supplement to _Men’s Wear_, or\r\n_The Tailor and Cutter_, Full Dress For Ceremonial Occasions. I had\r\neven the disconcerting sensations of an unfamiliar collar. I felt\r\nlost—in a strange body, and when I glanced down myself for reassurance,\r\nthe straight white abdomen, the alien legs confirmed that impression.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was my best man, and looked like a banker—a little banker—in\r\nflower. He wore a white rose in his buttonhole. He wasn’t, I think,\r\nparticularly talkative. At least I recall very little from him.\r\n\r\n“George” he said once or twice, “this is a great occasion for you—a\r\nvery great occasion.” He spoke a little doubtfully.\r\n\r\nYou see I had told him nothing about Marion until about a week before\r\nthe wedding; both he and my aunt had been taken altogether by surprise.\r\nThey couldn’t, as people say, “make it out.” My aunt was intensely\r\ninterested, much more than my uncle; it was then, I think, for the\r\nfirst time that I really saw that she cared for me. She got me alone, I\r\nremember, after I had made my announcement. “Now, George,” she said,\r\n“tell me everything about her. Why didn’t you tell—ME at least—before?”\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find how difficult it was to tell her about Marion.\r\nI perplexed her.\r\n\r\n“Then is she beautiful?” she asked at last.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you’ll think of her,” I parried. “I think—”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I think she might be the most beautiful person in the world.”\r\n\r\n“And isn’t she? To you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” I said, nodding my head. “Yes. She IS...”\r\n\r\nAnd while I don’t remember anything my uncle said or did at the\r\nwedding, I do remember very distinctly certain little things, scrutiny,\r\nsolicitude, a curious rare flash of intimacy in my aunt’s eyes. It\r\ndawned on me that I wasn’t hiding anything from her at all. She was\r\ndressed very smartly, wearing a big-plumed hat that made her neck seem\r\nlonger and slenderer than ever, and when she walked up the aisle with\r\nthat rolling stride of hers and her eye all on Marion, perplexed into\r\nself-forgetfulness, it wasn’t somehow funny. She was, I do believe,\r\ngiving my marriage more thought than I had done, she was concerned\r\nbeyond measure at my black rage and Marion’s blindness, she was looking\r\nwith eyes that knew what loving is—for love.\r\n\r\nIn the vestry she turned away as we signed, and I verily believe she\r\nwas crying, though to this day I can’t say why she should have cried,\r\nand she was near crying too when she squeezed my hand at parting—and\r\nshe never said a word or looked at me, but just squeezed my hand....\r\n\r\nIf I had not been so grim in spirit, I think I should have found much\r\nof my wedding amusing. I remember a lot of ridiculous detail that still\r\ndeclines to be funny in my memory. The officiating clergyman had a\r\ncold, and turned his “n’s” to “d’s,” and he made the most mechanical\r\ncompliment conceivable about the bride’s age when the register was\r\nsigned. Every bride he had ever married had had it, one knew. And two\r\nmiddle-aged spinsters, cousins of Marion’s and dressmakers at Barking,\r\nstand out. They wore marvellously bright and gay blouses and dim old\r\nskirts, and had an immense respect for Mr. Ramboat. They threw rice;\r\nthey brought a whole bag with them and gave handfuls away to unknown\r\nlittle boys at the church door and so created a Lilliputian riot; and\r\none had meant to throw a slipper. It was a very warm old silk slipper,\r\nI know, because she dropped it out of a pocket in the aisle—there was a\r\nsort of jumble in the aisle—and I picked it up for her. I don’t think\r\nshe actually threw it, for as we drove away from the church I saw her\r\nin a dreadful, and, it seemed to me, hopeless, struggle with her\r\npocket; and afterwards my eye caught the missile of good fortune lying,\r\nit or its fellow, most obviously mislaid, behind the umbrella-stand in\r\nthe hall....\r\n\r\nThe whole business was much more absurd, more incoherent, more human\r\nthan I had anticipated, but I was far too young and serious to let the\r\nlatter quality atone for its shortcomings. I am so remote from this\r\nphase of my youth that I can look back at it all as dispassionately as\r\none looks at a picture—at some wonderful, perfect sort of picture that\r\nis inexhaustible; but at the time these things filled me with\r\nunspeakable resentment. Now I go round it all, look into its details,\r\ngeneralise about its aspects. I’m interested, for example, to square it\r\nwith my Bladesover theory of the British social scheme. Under stress of\r\ntradition we were all of us trying in the fermenting chaos of London to\r\ncarry out the marriage ceremonies of a Bladesover tenant or one of the\r\nchubby middling sort of people in some dependent country town. There a\r\nmarriage is a public function with a public significance. There the\r\nchurch is to a large extent the gathering-place of the community, and\r\nyour going to be married a thing of importance to every one you pass on\r\nthe road. It is a change of status that quite legitimately interests\r\nthe whole neighbourhood. But in London there are no neighbours, nobody\r\nknows, nobody cares. An absolute stranger in an office took my notice,\r\nand our banns were proclaimed to ears that had never previously heard\r\nour names. The clergyman, even, who married us had never seen us\r\nbefore, and didn’t in any degree intimate that he wanted to see us\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNeighbours in London! The Ramboats did not know the names of the people\r\non either side of them. As I waited for Marion before we started off\r\nupon our honeymoon flight, Mr. Ramboat, I remember, came and stood\r\nbeside me and stared out of the window.\r\n\r\n“There was a funeral over there yesterday,” he said, by way of making\r\nconversation, and moved his head at the house opposite. “Quite a smart\r\naffair it was with a glass ’earse....”\r\n\r\nAnd our little procession of three carriages with white-favour-adorned\r\nhorses and drivers, went through all the huge, noisy, indifferent\r\ntraffic like a lost china image in the coal-chute of an ironclad.\r\nNobody made way for us, nobody cared for us; the driver of an omnibus\r\njeered; for a long time we crawled behind an unamiable dust-cart. The\r\nirrelevant clatter and tumult gave a queer flavour of indecency to this\r\npublic coming together of lovers. We seemed to have obtruded ourselves\r\nshamelessly. The crowd that gathered outside the church would have\r\ngathered in the same spirit and with greater alacrity for a street\r\naccident....\r\n\r\nAt Charing Cross—we were going to Hastings—the experienced eye of the\r\nguard detected the significance of our unusual costume and he secured\r\nus a compartment.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, as the train moved out of the station, “_That’s_ all\r\nover!” And I turned to Marion—a little unfamiliar still, in her\r\nunfamiliar clothes—and smiled.\r\n\r\nShe regarded me gravely, timidly.\r\n\r\n“You’re not cross?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Cross! Why?”\r\n\r\n“At having it all proper.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Marion!” said I, and by way of answer took and kissed her\r\nwhite-gloved, leather-scented hand....\r\n\r\nI don’t remember much else about the journey, an hour or so it was of\r\nundistinguished time—for we were both confused and a little fatigued\r\nand Marion had a slight headache and did not want caresses. I fell into\r\na reverie about my aunt, and realised as if it were a new discovery,\r\nthat I cared for her very greatly. I was acutely sorry I had not told\r\nher earlier of my marriage.\r\n\r\nBut you will not want to hear the history of my honeymoon. I have told\r\nall that was needed to serve my present purpose. Thus and thus it was\r\nthe Will in things had its way with me. Driven by forces I did not\r\nunderstand, diverted altogether from the science, the curiosities and\r\nwork to which I had once given myself, I fought my way through a tangle\r\nof traditions, customs, obstacles and absurdities, enraged myself,\r\nlimited myself, gave myself to occupations I saw with the clearest\r\nvision were dishonourable and vain, and at last achieved the end of\r\npurblind Nature, the relentless immediacy of her desire, and held, far\r\nshort of happiness, Marion weeping and reluctant in my arms.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWho can tell the story of the slow estrangement of two married people,\r\nthe weakening of first this bond and then that of that complex contact?\r\nLeast of all can one of the two participants. Even now, with an\r\ninterval of fifteen years to clear it up for me, I still find a mass of\r\nimpressions of Marion as confused, as discordant, as unsystematic and\r\nself-contradictory as life. I think of this thing and love her, of that\r\nand hate her—of a hundred aspects in which I can now see her with an\r\nunimpassioned sympathy. As I sit here trying to render some vision of\r\nthis infinitely confused process, I recall moments of hard and fierce\r\nestrangement, moments of clouded intimacy, the passage of transition\r\nall forgotten. We talked a little language together whence were\r\n“friends,” and I was “Mutney” and she was “Ming,” and we kept up such\r\nan outward show that till the very end Smithie thought our household\r\nthe most amiable in the world.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell to the full how Marion thwarted me and failed in that\r\nlife of intimate emotions which is the kernel of love. That life of\r\nintimate emotions is made up of little things. A beautiful face differs\r\nfrom an ugly one by a difference of surfaces and proportions that are\r\nsometimes almost infinitesimally small. I find myself setting down\r\nlittle things and little things; none of them do more than demonstrate\r\nthose essential temperamental discords I have already sought to make\r\nclear. Some readers will understand—to others I shall seem no more than\r\nan unfeeling brute who couldn’t make allowances.... It’s easy to make\r\nallowances now; but to be young and ardent and to make allowances, to\r\nsee one’s married life open before one, the life that seemed in its\r\ndawn a glory, a garden of roses, a place of deep sweet mysteries and\r\nheart throbs and wonderful silences, and to see it a vista of\r\ntolerations and baby-talk; a compromise, the least effectual thing in\r\nall one’s life.\r\n\r\nEvery love romance I read seemed to mock our dull intercourse, every\r\npoem, every beautiful picture reflected upon the uneventful succession\r\nof grey hours we had together. I think our real difference was one of\r\naesthetic sensibility.\r\n\r\nI do still recall as the worst and most disastrous aspect of all that\r\ntime, her absolute disregard of her own beauty. It’s the pettiest thing\r\nto record, I know, but she could wear curl-papers in my presence. It\r\nwas her idea, too, to “wear out” her old clothes and her failures at\r\nhome when “no one was likely to see her”—“no one” being myself. She\r\nallowed me to accumulate a store of ungracious and slovenly\r\nmemories....\r\n\r\nAll our conceptions of life differed. I remember how we differed about\r\nfurniture. We spent three or four days in Tottenham Court Road, and she\r\nchose the things she fancied with an inexorable resolution,—sweeping\r\naside my suggestions with—“Oh, _you_ want such queer things.” She\r\npursued some limited, clearly seen and experienced ideal—that excluded\r\nall other possibilities. Over every mantel was a mirror that was\r\ndraped, our sideboard was wonderfully good and splendid with beveled\r\nglass, we had lamps on long metal stalks and cozy corners and plants in\r\ngrog-tubs. Smithie approved it all. There wasn’t a place where one\r\ncould sit and read in the whole house. My books went upon shelves in\r\nthe dining-room recess. And we had a piano though Marion’s playing was\r\nat an elementary level.\r\n\r\nYou know, it was the cruelest luck for Marion that I, with my\r\nrestlessness, my scepticism, my constantly developing ideas, had\r\ninsisted on marriage with her. She had no faculty of growth or change;\r\nshe had taken her mould, she had set in the limited ideas of her\r\npeculiar class. She preserved her conception of what was right in\r\ndrawing-room chairs and in marriage ceremonial and in every relation of\r\nlife with a simple and luminous honesty and conviction, with an immense\r\nunimaginative inflexibility—as a tailor-bird builds its nest or a\r\nbeaver makes its dam.\r\n\r\nLet me hasten over this history of disappointments and separation. I\r\nmight tell of waxings and waning of love between us, but the whole was\r\nwaning. Sometimes she would do things for me, make me a tie or a pair\r\nof slippers, and fill me with none the less gratitude because the\r\nthings were absurd. She ran our home and our one servant with a hard,\r\nbright efficiency. She was inordinately proud of house and garden.\r\nAlways, by her lights, she did her duty by me.\r\n\r\nPresently the rapid development of Tono-Bungay began to take me into\r\nthe provinces, and I would be away sometimes for a week together. This\r\nshe did not like; it left her “dull,” she said, but after a time she\r\nbegan to go to Smithie’s again and to develop an independence of me. At\r\nSmithie’s she was now a woman with a position; she had money to spend.\r\nShe would take Smithie to theatres and out to lunch and talk\r\ninterminably of the business, and Smithie became a sort of permanent\r\nweekender with us. Also Marion got a spaniel and began to dabble with\r\nthe minor arts, with poker-work and a Kodak and hyacinths in glasses.\r\nShe called once on a neighbour. Her parents left Walham Green—her\r\nfather severed his connection with the gas-works—and came to live in a\r\nsmall house I took for them near us, and they were much with us.\r\n\r\nOdd the littleness of the things that exasperate when the fountains of\r\nlife are embittered! My father-in-law was perpetually catching me in\r\nmoody moments and urging me to take to gardening. He irritated me\r\nbeyond measure.\r\n\r\n“You think too much,” he would say. “If you was to let in a bit with a\r\nspade, you might soon ’ave that garden of yours a Vision of Flowers.\r\nThat’s better than thinking, George.”\r\n\r\nOr in a torrent of exasperation, “I CARN’T think, George, why you don’t\r\nget a bit of glass ’ere. This sunny corner you c’d do wonders with a\r\nbit of glass.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the summer time he never came in without performing a sort of\r\nconjuring trick in the hall, and taking cucumbers and tomatoes from\r\nunexpected points of his person. “All out o’ MY little bit,” he’d say\r\nin exemplary tones. He left a trail of vegetable produce in the most\r\nunusual places, on mantel boards, sideboards, the tops of pictures.\r\nHeavens! how the sudden unexpected tomato could annoy me!...\r\n\r\nIt did much to widen our estrangement that Marion and my aunt failed to\r\nmake friends, became, by a sort of instinct, antagonistic.\r\n\r\nMy aunt, to begin with, called rather frequently, for she was really\r\nanxious to know Marion. At first she would arrive like a whirlwind and\r\npervade the house with an atmosphere of hello! She dressed already with\r\nthat cheerfully extravagant abandon that signalised her accession to\r\nfortune, and dressed her best for these visits.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to play the mother to me, I fancy, to tell Marion occult\r\nsecrets about the way I wore out my boots and how I never could think\r\nto put on thicker things in cold weather. But Marion received her with\r\nthat defensive suspiciousness of the shy person, thinking only of the\r\npossible criticism of herself; and my aunt, perceiving this, became\r\nnervous and slangy...\r\n\r\n“She says such queer things,” said Marion once, discussing her. “But I\r\nsuppose it’s witty.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said; “it _is_ witty.”\r\n\r\n“If I said things like she does—”\r\n\r\nThe queer things my aunt said were nothing to the queer things she\r\ndidn’t say. I remember her in our drawing-room one day, and how she\r\ncocked her eye—it’s the only expression—at the India-rubber plant in a\r\nDoulton-ware pot which Marion had placed on the corner of the piano.\r\n\r\nShe was on the very verge of speech. Then suddenly she caught my\r\nexpression, and shrank up like a cat that has been discovered looking\r\nat the milk.\r\n\r\nThen a wicked impulse took her.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t say an old word, George,” she insisted, looking me full in the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nI smiled. “You’re a dear,” I said, “not to,” as Marion came lowering\r\ninto the room to welcome her. But I felt extraordinarily like a\r\ntraitor—to the India-rubber plant, I suppose—for all that nothing had\r\nbeen said...\r\n\r\n“Your aunt makes Game of people,” was Marion’s verdict, and,\r\nopen-mindedly: “I suppose it’s all right... for her.”\r\n\r\nSeveral times we went to the house in Beckenham for lunch, and once or\r\ntwice to dinner. My aunt did her peculiar best to be friends, but\r\nMarion was implacable. She was also, I know, intensely uncomfortable,\r\nand she adopted as her social method, an exhausting silence, replying\r\ncompactly and without giving openings to anything that was said to her.\r\n\r\nThe gaps between my aunt’s visits grew wider and wider.\r\n\r\nMy married existence became at last like a narrow deep groove in the\r\nbroad expanse of interests in which I was living. I went about the\r\nworld; I met a great number of varied personalities; I read endless\r\nbooks in trains as I went to and fro. I developed social relationships\r\nat my uncle’s house that Marion did not share. The seeds of new ideas\r\npoured in upon me and grew in me. Those early and middle years of one’s\r\nthird decade are, I suppose, for a man the years of greatest mental\r\ngrowth. They are restless years and full of vague enterprise.\r\n\r\nEach time I returned to Ealing, life there seemed more alien, narrow,\r\nand unattractive—and Marion less beautiful and more limited and\r\ndifficult—until at last she was robbed of every particle of her magic.\r\nShe gave me always a cooler welcome, I think, until she seemed entirely\r\napathetic. I never asked myself then what heartaches she might hide or\r\nwhat her discontents might be.\r\n\r\nI would come home hoping nothing, expecting nothing.\r\n\r\nThis was my fated life, and I had chosen it. I became more sensitive to\r\nthe defects I had once disregarded altogether; I began to associate her\r\nsallow complexion with her temperamental insufficiency, and the heavier\r\nlines of her mouth and nostril with her moods of discontent. We drifted\r\napart; wider and wider the gap opened. I tired of baby-talk and\r\nstereotyped little fondlings; I tired of the latest intelligence from\r\nthose wonderful workrooms, and showed it all too plainly; we hardly\r\nspoke when we were alone together. The mere unreciprocated physical\r\nresidue of my passion remained—an exasperation between us.\r\n\r\nNo children came to save us. Marion had acquired at Smithie’s a disgust\r\nand dread of maternity. All that was the fruition and quintessence of\r\nthe “horrid” elements in life, a disgusting thing, a last indignity\r\nthat overtook unwary women. I doubt indeed a little if children would\r\nhave saved us; we should have differed so fatally about their\r\nupbringing.\r\n\r\nAltogether, I remember my life with Marion as a long distress, now\r\nhard, now tender. It was in those days that I first became critical of\r\nmy life and burdened with a sense of error and maladjustment. I would\r\nlie awake in the night, asking myself the purpose of things, reviewing\r\nmy unsatisfying, ungainly home-life, my days spent in rascal enterprise\r\nand rubbish-selling, contrasting all I was being and doing with my\r\nadolescent ambitions, my Wimblehurst dreams. My circumstances had an\r\nair of finality, and I asked myself in vain why I had forced myself\r\ninto them.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe end of our intolerable situation came suddenly and unexpectedly,\r\nbut in a way that I suppose was almost inevitable.\r\n\r\nMy alienated affections wandered, and I was unfaithful to Marion.\r\n\r\nI won’t pretend to extenuate the quality of my conduct. I was a young\r\nand fairly vigorous male; all my appetite for love had been roused and\r\nwhetted and none of it had been satisfied by my love affair and my\r\nmarriage. I had pursued an elusive gleam of beauty to the disregard of\r\nall else, and it had failed me. It had faded when I had hoped it would\r\ngrow brighter. I despaired of life and was embittered. And things\r\nhappened as I am telling. I don’t draw any moral at all in the matter,\r\nand as for social remedies, I leave them to the social reformer. I’ve\r\ngot to a time of life when the only theories that interest me are\r\ngeneralisations about realities.\r\n\r\nTo go to our inner office in Raggett Street I had to walk through a\r\nroom in which the typists worked. They were the correspondence typists;\r\nour books and invoicing had long since overflowed into the premises we\r\nhad had the luck to secure on either side of us. I was, I must confess,\r\nalways in a faintly cloudily-emotional way aware of that collection of\r\nfor the most part round-shouldered femininity, but presently one of the\r\ngirls detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my\r\nattention. I appreciated her at first as a straight little back, a\r\nneater back than any of the others; as a softly rounded neck with a\r\nsmiling necklace of sham pearls; as chestnut hair very neatly done—and\r\nas a side-long glance; presently as a quickly turned face that looked\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nMy eye would seek her as I went through on business things—I dictated\r\nsome letters to her and so discovered she had pretty, soft-looking\r\nhands with pink nails. Once or twice, meeting casually, we looked one\r\nanother for the flash of a second in the eyes.\r\n\r\nThat was all. But it was enough in the mysterious free-masonry of sex\r\nto say essential things. We had a secret between us.\r\n\r\nOne day I came into Raggett Street at lunch time and she was alone,\r\nsitting at her desk. She glanced up as I entered, and then became very\r\nstill, with a downcast face and her hands clenched on the table. I\r\nwalked right by her to the door of the inner office, stopped, came back\r\nand stood over her.\r\n\r\nWe neither of us spoke for quite a perceptible time. I was trembling\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n“Is that one of the new typewriters?” I asked at last for the sake of\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me without a word, with her face flushed and her eyes\r\nalight, and I bent down and kissed her lips. She leant back to put an\r\narm about me, drew my face to her and kissed me again and again. I\r\nlifted her and held her in my arms. She gave a little smothered cry to\r\nfeel herself so held.\r\n\r\nNever before had I known the quality of passionate kisses.\r\n\r\nSomebody became audible in the shop outside.\r\n\r\nWe started back from one another with flushed faces and bright and\r\nburning eyes.\r\n\r\n“We can’t talk here,” I whispered with a confident intimacy. “Where do\r\nyou go at five?”\r\n\r\n“Along the Embankment to Charing Cross,” she answered as intimately.\r\n“None of the others go that way...”\r\n\r\n“About half-past five?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, half-past five...”\r\n\r\nThe door from the shop opened, and she sat down very quickly.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad,” I said in a commonplace voice, “that these new typewriters\r\nare all right.”\r\n\r\nI went into the inner office and routed out the paysheet in order to\r\nfind her name—Effie Rink. And did no work at all that afternoon. I\r\nfretted about that dingy little den like a beast in a cage.\r\n\r\nWhen presently I went out, Effie was working with an extraordinary\r\nappearance of calm—and there was no look for me at all....\r\n\r\nWe met and had our talk that evening, a talk in whispers when there was\r\nnone to overhear; we came to an understanding. It was strangely unlike\r\nany dream of romance I had ever entertained.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nI came back after a week’s absence to my home again—a changed man. I\r\nhad lived out my first rush of passion for Effie, had come to a\r\ncontemplation of my position. I had gauged Effie’s place in the scheme\r\nof things, and parted from her for a time. She was back in her place at\r\nRaggett Street after a temporary indisposition. I did not feel in any\r\nway penitent or ashamed, I know, as I opened the little cast-iron gate\r\nthat kept Marion’s front grader and Pampas Grass from the wandering\r\ndog. Indeed, if anything, I felt as if I had vindicated some right that\r\nhad been in question. I came back to Marion with no sense of\r\nwrong-doing at all with, indeed, a new friendliness towards her. I\r\ndon’t know how it may be proper to feel on such occasions; that is how\r\nI felt.\r\n\r\nI followed her in our drawing-room, standing beside the tall lamp-stand\r\nthat half filled the bay as though she had just turned from watching\r\nfor me at the window. There was something in her pale face that\r\narrested me. She looked as if she had not been sleeping. She did not\r\ncome forward to greet me.\r\n\r\n“You’ve come home,” she said.\r\n\r\n“As I wrote to you.”\r\n\r\nShe stood very still, a dusky figure against the bright window.\r\n\r\n“Where have you been?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“East Coast,” I said easily.\r\n\r\nShe paused for a moment. “I _know_,” she said.\r\n\r\nI stared at her. It was the most amazing moment in any life....\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” I said at last, “I believe you do!”\r\n\r\n“And then you come home to me!”\r\n\r\nI walked to the hearthrug and stood quite still there regarding this\r\nnew situation.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t dream,” she began. “How could you do such a thing?”\r\n\r\nIt seemed a long interval before either of us spoke another word.\r\n\r\n“Who knows about it?” I asked at last.\r\n\r\n“Smithie’s brother. They were at Cromer.”\r\n\r\n“Confound Cromer! Yes!”\r\n\r\n“How could you bring yourself”\r\n\r\nI felt a spasm of petulant annoyance at this unexpected catastrophe.\r\n\r\n“I should like to wring Smithie’s brother’s neck,” I said....\r\n\r\nMarion spoke in dry, broken fragments of sentences. “You... I’d always\r\nthought that anyhow you couldn’t deceive me... I suppose all men are\r\nhorrid—about this.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t strike me as horrid. It seems to me the most necessary\r\nconsequence—and natural thing in the world.”\r\n\r\nI became aware of some one moving about in the passage, and went and\r\nshut the door of the room, then I walked back to the hearthrug and\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n“It’s rough on you,” I said. “But I didn’t mean you to know. You’ve\r\nnever cared for me. I’ve had the devil of a time. Why should you mind?”\r\n\r\nShe sat down in a draped armchair. “I _have_ cared for you,” she said.\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” she said, “_she_ cares for you?”\r\n\r\nI had no answer.\r\n\r\n“Where is she now?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! does it matter to you?... Look here, Marion! This—this I didn’t\r\nanticipate. I didn’t mean this thing to smash down on you like this.\r\nBut, you know, something had to happen. I’m sorry—sorry to the bottom\r\nof my heart that things have come to this between us. But indeed, I’m\r\ntaken by surprise. I don’t know where I am—I don’t know how we got\r\nhere. Things took me by surprise. I found myself alone with her one\r\nday. I kissed her. I went on. It seemed stupid to go back. And\r\nbesides—why should I have gone back? Why should I? From first to last,\r\nI’ve hardly thought of it as touching you.... Damn!”\r\n\r\nShe scrutinised my face, and pulled at the ball-fringe of the little\r\ntable beside her.\r\n\r\n“To think of it,” she said. “I don’t believe I can ever touch you\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nWe kept a long silence. I was only beginning to realise in the most\r\nsuperficial way the immense catastrophe that had happened between us.\r\nEnormous issues had rushed upon us. I felt unprepared and altogether\r\ninadequate. I was unreasonably angry. There came a rush of stupid\r\nexpressions to my mind that my rising sense of the supreme importance\r\nof the moment saved me from saying. The gap of silence widened until it\r\nthreatened to become the vast memorable margin of some one among a\r\nthousand trivial possibilities of speech that would vex our relations\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nOur little general servant tapped at the door—Marion always liked the\r\nservant to tap—and appeared.\r\n\r\n“Tea, M’m,” she said—and vanished, leaving the door open.\r\n\r\n“I will go upstairs,” said I, and stopped. “I will go upstairs” I\r\nrepeated, “and put my bag in the spare room.”\r\n\r\nWe remained motionless and silent for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n“Mother is having tea with us to-day,” Marion remarked at last, and\r\ndropped the worried end of ball-fringe and stood up slowly....\r\n\r\nAnd so, with this immense discussion of our changed relations hanging\r\nover us, we presently had tea with the unsuspecting Mrs. Ramboat and\r\nthe spaniel. Mrs. Ramboat was too well trained in her position to\r\nremark upon our somber preoccupation. She kept a thin trickle of talk\r\ngoing, and told us, I remember, that Mr. Ramboat was “troubled” about\r\nhis cannas.\r\n\r\n“They don’t come up and they won’t come up. He’s been round and had an\r\nexplanation with the man who sold him the bulbs—and he’s very heated\r\nand upset.”\r\n\r\nThe spaniel was a great bore, begging and doing small tricks first at\r\none and then at the other of us. Neither of us used his name. You see\r\nwe had called him Miggles, and made a sort of trio in the baby-talk of\r\nMutney and Miggles and Ming.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThen presently we resumed our monstrous, momentous dialogue. I can’t\r\nnow make out how long that dialogue went on. It spread itself, I know,\r\nin heavy fragments over either three days or four. I remember myself\r\ngrouped with Marion, talking sitting on our bed in her room, talking\r\nstanding in our dining-room, saving this thing or that. Twice we went\r\nfor long walks. And we had a long evening alone together, with jaded\r\nnerves and hearts that fluctuated between a hard and dreary recognition\r\nof facts and, on my part at least, a strange unwonted tenderness;\r\nbecause in some extraordinary way this crisis had destroyed our mutual\r\napathy and made us feel one another again.\r\n\r\nIt was a dialogue that had discrepant parts that fell into lumps of\r\ntalk that failed to join on to their predecessors, that began again at\r\na different level, higher or lower, that assumed new aspects in the\r\nintervals and assimilated new considerations. We discussed the fact\r\nthat we two were no longer lovers; never before had we faced that. It\r\nseems a strange thing to write, but as I look back, I see clearly that\r\nthose several days were the time when Marion and I were closest\r\ntogether, looked for the first and last time faithfully and steadfastly\r\ninto each other’s soul. For those days only, there were no pretences, I\r\nmade no concessions to her nor she to me; we concealed nothing,\r\nexaggerated nothing. We had done with pretending. We had it out plainly\r\nand soberly with each other. Mood followed mood and got its stark\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nOf course there was quarreling between us, bitter quarreling, and we\r\nsaid things to one another—long pent-up things that bruised and crushed\r\nand cut. But over it all in my memory now is an effect of deliberate\r\nconfrontation, and the figure of Marion stands up, pale, melancholy,\r\ntear-stained, injured, implacable and dignified.\r\n\r\n“You love her?” she asked once, and jerked that doubt into my mind.\r\n\r\nI struggled with tangled ideas and emotions. “I don’t know what love\r\nis. It’s all sorts of things—it’s made of a dozen strands twisted in a\r\nthousand ways.”\r\n\r\n“But you want her? You want her now—when you think of her?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I reflected. “I want her—right enough.”\r\n\r\n“And me? Where do I come in?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you come in here.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but what are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“Do!” I said with the exasperation of the situation growing upon me.\r\n“What do you want me to do?”\r\n\r\nAs I look back upon all that time—across a gulf of fifteen active\r\nyears—I find I see it with an understanding judgment. I see it as if it\r\nwere the business of some one else—indeed of two other\r\npeople—intimately known yet judged without passion. I see now that this\r\nshock, this sudden immense disillusionment, did in real fact bring out\r\na mind and soul in Marion; that for the first time she emerged from\r\nhabits, timidities, imitations, phrases and a certain narrow\r\nwill-impulse, and became a personality.\r\n\r\nHer ruling motive at first was, I think, an indignant and outraged\r\npride. This situation must end. She asked me categorically to give up\r\nEffie, and I, full of fresh and glowing memories, absolutely refused.\r\n\r\n“It’s too late, Marion,” I said. “It can’t be done like that.”\r\n\r\n“Then we can’t very well go on living together,” she said. “Can we?”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I deliberated “if you must have it so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, can we?”\r\n\r\n“Can you stay in this house? I mean—if I go away?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.... I don’t think I could.”\r\n\r\n“Then—what do you want?”\r\n\r\nSlowly we worked our way from point to point, until at last the word\r\n“divorce” was before us.\r\n\r\n“If we can’t live together we ought to be free,” said Marion.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything of divorce,” I said—“if you mean that. I don’t\r\nknow how it is done. I shall have to ask somebody—or look it up....\r\nPerhaps, after all, it is the thing to do. We may as well face it.”\r\n\r\nWe began to talk ourselves into a realisation of what our divergent\r\nfutures might be. I came back on the evening of that day with my\r\nquestions answered by a solicitor.\r\n\r\n“We can’t as a matter of fact,” I said, “get divorced as things are.\r\nApparently, so far as the law goes you’ve got to stand this sort of\r\nthing. It’s silly but that is the law. However, it’s easy to arrange a\r\ndivorce. In addition to adultery there must be desertion or cruelty. To\r\nestablish cruelty I should have to strike you, or something of that\r\nsort, before witnesses. That’s impossible—but it’s simple to desert you\r\nlegally. I have to go away from you; that’s all. I can go on sending\r\nyou money—and you bring a suit, what is it?—for Restitution of Conjugal\r\nRights. The Court orders me to return. I disobey. Then you can go on to\r\ndivorce me. You get a Decree Nisi, and once more the Court tries to\r\nmake me come back. If we don’t make it up within six months and if you\r\ndon’t behave scandalously the Decree is made absolute. That’s the end\r\nof the fuss. That’s how one gets unmarried. It’s easier, you see, to\r\nmarry than unmarry.”\r\n\r\n“And then—how do I live? What becomes of me?”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have an income. They call it alimony. From a third to a half of\r\nmy present income—more if you like—I don’t mind—three hundred a year,\r\nsay. You’ve got your old people to keep and you’ll need all that.”\r\n\r\n“And then—then you’ll be free?”\r\n\r\n“Both of us.”\r\n\r\n“And all this life you’ve hated”\r\n\r\nI looked up at her wrung and bitter face. “I haven’t hated it,” I lied,\r\nmy voice near breaking with the pain of it all. “Have you?”\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe perplexing thing about life is the irresolvable complexity of\r\nreality, of things and relations alike. Nothing is simple. Every wrong\r\ndone has a certain justice in it, and every good deed has dregs of\r\nevil. As for us, young still, and still without self-knowledge,\r\nresounded a hundred discordant notes in the harsh angle of that shock.\r\nWe were furiously angry with each other, tender with each other,\r\ncallously selfish, generously self-sacrificing.\r\n\r\nI remember Marion saying innumerable detached things that didn’t hang\r\ntogether one with another, that contradicted one another, that were,\r\nnevertheless, all in their places profoundly true and sincere. I see\r\nthem now as so many vain experiments in her effort to apprehend the\r\ncrumpled confusions of our complex moral landslide. Some I found\r\nirritating beyond measure. I answered her—sometimes quite abominably.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she would say again and again, “my life has been a\r\nfailure.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve besieged you for three years,” I would retort “asking it not to\r\nbe. You’ve done as you pleased. If I’ve turned away at last—”\r\n\r\nOr again she would revive all the stresses before our marriage.\r\n\r\n“How you must hate me! I made you wait. Well now—I suppose you have\r\nyour revenge.”\r\n\r\n“_Revenge!_” I echoed.\r\n\r\nThen she would try over the aspects of our new separated lives.\r\n\r\n“I ought to earn my own living,” she would insist.\r\n\r\n“I want to be quite independent. I’ve always hated London. Perhaps I\r\nshall try a poultry farm and bees. You won’t mind at first my being a\r\nburden. Afterwards—”\r\n\r\n“We’ve settled all that,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you will hate me anyhow...”\r\n\r\nThere were times when she seemed to regard our separation with absolute\r\ncomplacency, when she would plan all sorts of freedoms and\r\ncharacteristic interests.\r\n\r\n“I shall go out a lot with Smithie,” she said.\r\n\r\nAnd once she said an ugly thing that I did indeed hate her for that I\r\ncannot even now quite forgive her.\r\n\r\n“Your aunt will rejoice at all this. She never cared for me...”\r\n\r\nInto my memory of these pains and stresses comes the figure of Smithie,\r\nfull-charged with emotion, so breathless in the presence of the horrid\r\nvillain of the piece that she could make no articulate sounds. She had\r\nlong tearful confidences with Marion, I know, sympathetic close\r\nclingings. There were moments when only absolute speechlessness\r\nprevented her giving me a stupendous “talking-to”—I could see it in her\r\neye. The wrong things she would have said! And I recall, too, Mrs.\r\nRamboat’s slow awakening to something in, the air, the growing\r\nexpression of solicitude in her eye, only her well-trained fear of\r\nMarion keeping her from speech.\r\n\r\nAnd at last through all this welter, like a thing fated and altogether\r\nbeyond our control, parting came to Marion and me.\r\n\r\nI hardened my heart, or I could not have gone. For at the last it came\r\nto Marion that she was parting from me for ever. That overbore all\r\nother things, had turned our last hour to anguish. She forgot for a\r\ntime the prospect of moving into a new house, she forgot the outrage on\r\nher proprietorship and pride. For the first time in her life she really\r\nshowed strong emotions in regard to me, for the first time, perhaps,\r\nthey really came to her. She began to weep slow, reluctant tears. I\r\ncame into her room, and found her asprawl on the bed, weeping.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know,” she cried. “Oh! I didn’t understand!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been a fool. All my life is a wreck!\r\n\r\n“I shall be alone!..._Mutney!_ Mutney, don’t leave me! Oh! Mutney! I\r\ndidn’t understand.”\r\n\r\nI had to harden my heart indeed, for it seemed to me at moments in\r\nthose last hours together that at last, too late, the longed-for thing\r\nhad happened and Marion had come alive. A new-born hunger for me lit\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n“Don’t leave me!” she said, “don’t leave me!” She clung to me; she\r\nkissed me with tear-salt lips.\r\n\r\nI was promised now and pledged, and I hardened my heart against this\r\nimpossible dawn. Yet it seems to me that there were moments when it\r\nneeded but a cry, but one word to have united us again for all our\r\nlives. Could we have united again? Would that passage have enlightened\r\nus for ever or should we have fallen back in a week or so into the old\r\nestrangement, the old temperamental opposition?\r\n\r\nOf that there is now no telling. Our own resolve carried us on our\r\npredestined way. We behaved more and more like separating lovers,\r\nparting inexorably, but all the preparations we had set going worked on\r\nlike a machine, and we made no attempt to stop them. My trunks and\r\nboxes went to the station. I packed my bag with Marion standing before\r\nme. We were like children who had hurt each other horribly in sheer\r\nstupidity, who didn’t know now how to remedy it. We belonged to each\r\nother immensely—immensely. The cab came to the little iron gate.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye!” I said.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment we held one another in each other’s arms and\r\nkissed—incredibly without malice. We heard our little servant in the\r\npassage going to open the door. For the last time we pressed ourselves\r\nto one another. We were not lovers nor enemies, but two human souls in\r\na frank community of pain. I tore myself from her.\r\n\r\n“Go away,” I said to the servant, seeing that Marion had followed me\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nI felt her standing behind me as I spoke to the cab man.\r\n\r\nI got into the cab, resolutely not looking back, and then as it started\r\njumped up, craned out and looked at the door.\r\n\r\nIt was wide open, but she had disappeared....\r\n\r\nI wonder—I suppose she ran upstairs.\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nSo I parted from Marion at an extremity of perturbation and regret, and\r\nwent, as I had promised and arranged, to Effie, who was waiting for me\r\nin apartments near Orpington. I remember her upon the station platform,\r\na bright, flitting figure looking along the train for me, and our walk\r\nover the fields in the twilight. I had expected an immense sense of\r\nrelief where at last the stresses of separation were over, but now I\r\nfound I was beyond measure wretched and perplexed, full of the\r\nprofoundest persuasion of irreparable error. The dusk and somber Marion\r\nwere so alike, her sorrow seemed to be all about me. I had to hold\r\nmyself to my own plans, to remember that I must keep faith with Effie,\r\nwith Effie who had made no terms, exacted no guarantees, but flung\r\nherself into my hands.\r\n\r\nWe went across the evening fields in silence, towards a sky of\r\ndeepening gold and purple, and Effie was close beside me always, very\r\nclose, glancing up ever and again at my face.\r\n\r\nCertainly she knew I grieved for Marion, that ours was now no joyful\r\nreunion. But she showed no resentment and no jealousy. Extraordinarily,\r\nshe did not compete against Marion. Never once in all our time together\r\ndid she say an adverse word of Marion....\r\n\r\nShe set herself presently to dispel the shadow that brooded over me\r\nwith the same instinctive skill that some women will show with the\r\ntrouble of a child. She made herself my glad and pretty slave and\r\nhandmaid; she forced me at last to rejoice in her. Yet at the back of\r\nit all Marion remained, stupid and tearful and infinitely distressful,\r\nso that I was almost intolerably unhappy for her—for her and the dead\r\nbody of my married love.\r\n\r\nIt is all, as I tell it now, unaccountable to me. I go back into these\r\nremote parts, these rarely visited uplands and lonely tares of memory,\r\nand it seems to me still a strange country. I had thought I might be\r\ngoing to some sensuous paradise with Effie, but desire which fills the\r\nuniverse before its satisfaction, vanishes utterly like the going of\r\ndaylight—with achievement. All the facts and forms of life remain\r\ndarkling and cold. It was an upland of melancholy questionings, a\r\nregion from which I saw all the world at new angles and in new aspects;\r\nI had outflanked passion and romance.\r\n\r\nI had come into a condition of vast perplexities. For the first time in\r\nmy life, at least so it seems to me now in this retrospect, I looked at\r\nmy existence as a whole.\r\n\r\nSince this was nothing, what was I doing? What was I for?\r\n\r\nI was going to and fro about Tono-Bungay—the business I had taken up to\r\nsecure Marion and which held me now in spite of our intimate\r\nseparation—and snatching odd week-ends and nights for Orpington, and\r\nall the while I struggled with these obstinate interrogations. I used\r\nto fall into musing in the trains, I became even a little inaccurate\r\nand forgetful about business things. I have the clearest memory of\r\nmyself sitting thoughtful in the evening sunlight on a grassy hillside\r\nthat looked toward Seven Oaks and commanded a wide sweep of country,\r\nand that I was thinking out my destiny. I could almost write my thought\r\ndown now, I believe, as they came to me that afternoon. Effie, restless\r\nlittle cockney that she was, rustled and struggled in a hedgerow below,\r\ngathering flowers, discovering flowers she had never seen before. I\r\nhad. I remember, a letter from Marion in my pocket. I had even made\r\nsome tentatives for return, for a reconciliation; Heaven knows now how\r\nI had put it! but her cold, ill-written letter repelled me. I perceived\r\nI could never face that old inconclusive dullness of life again, that\r\nstagnant disappointment. That, anyhow, wasn’t possible. But what was\r\npossible? I could see no way of honour or fine living before me at all.\r\n\r\n“What am I to do with life?” that was the question that besieged me.\r\n\r\nI wondered if all the world was even as I, urged to this by one motive\r\nand to that by another, creatures of chance and impulse and unmeaning\r\ntraditions. Had I indeed to abide by what I had said and done and\r\nchosen? Was there nothing for me in honour but to provide for Effie, go\r\nback penitent to Marion and keep to my trade in rubbish—or find some\r\nfresh one—and so work out the residue of my days? I didn’t accept that\r\nfor a moment. But what else was I to do? I wondered if my case was the\r\ncase of many men, whether in former ages, too, men had been so\r\nguideless, so uncharted, so haphazard in their journey into life. In\r\nthe Middle Ages, in the old Catholic days, one went to a priest, and he\r\nsaid with all the finality of natural law, this you are and this you\r\nmust do. I wondered whether even in the Middle Ages I should have\r\naccepted that ruling without question.\r\n\r\nI remember too very distinctly how Effie came and sat beside me on a\r\nlittle box: that was before the casement window of our room.\r\n\r\n“Gloomkins,” said she.\r\n\r\nI smiled and remained head on hand, looking out of the window forgetful\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n“Did you love your wife so well?” she whispered softly.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” I cried, recalled again; “I don’t know. I don’t understand these\r\nthings. Life is a thing that hurts, my dear! It hurts without logic or\r\nreason. I’ve blundered! I didn’t understand. Anyhow—there is no need to\r\ngo hurting you, is there?”\r\n\r\nAnd I turned about and drew her to me, and kissed her ear....\r\n\r\nYes, I had a very bad time—I still recall. I suffered, I suppose, from\r\na sort of _ennui_ of the imagination. I found myself without an object\r\nto hold my will together. I sought. I read restlessly and discursively.\r\nI tried Ewart and got no help from him. As I regard it all now in this\r\nretrospect, it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned\r\naims I discovered myself for the first time. Before that I had seen\r\nonly the world and things in it, had sought them self-forgetful of all\r\nbut my impulse. Now I found myself _grouped_ with a system of appetites\r\nand satisfactions, with much work to do—and no desire, it seemed, left\r\nin me.\r\n\r\nThere were moments when I thought of suicide. At times my life appeared\r\nbefore me in bleak, relentless light, a series of ignorances, crude\r\nblunderings, degradation and cruelty. I had what the old theologians\r\ncall a “conviction of sin.” I sought salvation—not perhaps in the\r\nformula a Methodist preacher would recognise but salvation\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nMen find their salvation nowadays in many ways. Names and forms don’t,\r\nI think, matter very much; the real need is something that we can hold\r\nand that holds one. I have known a man find that determining factor in\r\na dry-plate factory, and another in writing a history of the Manor. So\r\nlong as it holds one, it does not matter. Many men and women nowadays\r\ntake up some concrete aspect of Socialism or social reform. But\r\nSocialism for me has always been a little bit too human, too set about\r\nwith personalities and foolishness. It isn’t my line. I don’t like\r\nthings so human. I don’t think I’m blind to the fun, the surprises, the\r\njolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of life, to the “humour of\r\nit,” as people say, and to adventure, but that isn’t the root of the\r\nmatter with me. There’s no humour in my blood. I’m in earnest in warp\r\nand woof. I stumble and flounder, but I know that over all these merry\r\nimmediate things, there are other things that are great and serene,\r\nvery high, beautiful things—the reality. I haven’t got it, but it’s\r\nthere nevertheless. I’m a spiritual guttersnipe in love with\r\nunimaginable goddesses. I’ve never seen the goddesses nor ever\r\nshall—but it takes all the fun out of the mud—and at times I fear it\r\ntakes all the kindliness, too.\r\n\r\nBut I’m talking of things I can’t expect the reader to understand,\r\nbecause I don’t half understand them myself. There is something links\r\nthings for me, a sunset or so, a mood or so, the high air, something\r\nthere was in Marion’s form and colour, something I find and lose in\r\nMantegna’s pictures, something in the lines of these boats I make. (You\r\nshould see X2, my last and best!)\r\n\r\nI can’t explain myself, I perceive. Perhaps it all comes to this, that\r\nI am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond my merits.\r\nNaturally I resist that as a complete solution. Anyhow, I had a sense\r\nof inexorable need, of distress and insufficiency that was unendurable,\r\nand for a time this aeronautical engineering allayed it....\r\n\r\nIn the end of this particular crisis of which I tell so badly, I\r\nidealised Science. I decided that in power and knowledge lay the\r\nsalvation of my life, the secret that would fill my need; that to these\r\nthings I would give myself.\r\n\r\nI emerged at last like a man who has been diving in darkness, clutching\r\nat a new resolve for which he had groped desperately and long.\r\n\r\nI came into the inner office suddenly one day—it must have been just\r\nbefore the time of Marion’s suit for restitution—and sat down before my\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” I said, “I’m sick of this.”\r\n\r\n“Hul_lo!_” he answered, and put some papers aside.\r\n\r\n“What’s up, George?”\r\n\r\n“Things are wrong.”\r\n\r\n“As how?”\r\n\r\n“My life,” I said, “it’s a mess, an infinite mess.”\r\n\r\n“She’s been a stupid girl, George,” he said; “I partly understand. But\r\nyou’re quit of her now, practically, and there’s just as good fish in\r\nthe sea—”\r\n\r\n“Oh! it’s not that!” I cried. “That’s only the part that shows. I’m\r\nsick—I’m sick of all this damned rascality.”\r\n\r\n“Eh? Eh?” said my uncle. “_What_—rascality?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _you_ know. I want some _stuff_, man. I want something to hold on\r\nto. I shall go amok if I don’t get it. I’m a different sort of beast\r\nfrom you. You float in all this bunkum. _I_ feel like a man floundering\r\nin a universe of soapsuds, up and downs, east and west. I can’t stand\r\nit. I must get my foot on something solid or—I don’t know what.”\r\n\r\nI laughed at the consternation in his face.\r\n\r\n“I mean it,” I said. “I’ve been thinking it over. I’ve made up my mind.\r\nIt’s no good arguing. I shall go in for work—real work. No! this isn’t\r\nwork; it’s only laborious cheating. But I’ve got an idea! It’s an old\r\nidea—I thought of years ago, but it came back to me. Look here! Why\r\nshould I fence about with you? I believe the time has come for flying\r\nto be possible. Real flying!”\r\n\r\n“Flying!”\r\n\r\nI stuck to that, and it helped me through the worst time in my life. My\r\nuncle, after some half-hearted resistance and a talk with my aunt,\r\nbehaved like the father of a spoilt son. He fixed up an arrangement\r\nthat gave me capital to play with, released me from too constant a\r\nsolicitude for the newer business developments—this was in what I may\r\ncall the later Moggs period of our enterprises—and I went to work at\r\nonce with grim intensity.\r\n\r\nBut I will tell of my soaring and flying machines in the proper place.\r\nI’ve been leaving the story of my uncle altogether too long. I wanted\r\nmerely to tell how it was I took to this work. I took to these\r\nexperiments after I had sought something that Marion in some\r\nindefinable way had seemed to promise. I toiled and forgot myself for a\r\ntime, and did many things. Science too has been something of an\r\nirresponsive mistress since, though I’ve served her better than I\r\nserved Marion. But at the time Science, with her order, her inhuman\r\ndistance, yet steely certainties, saved me from despair.\r\n\r\nWell, I have still to fly; but incidentally I have invented the\r\nlightest engines in the world.\r\n\r\nI am trying to tell of all the things that happened to me. It’s hard\r\nenough simply to get it put down in the remotest degree right. But this\r\nis a novel, not a treatise. Don’t imagine that I am coming presently to\r\nany sort of solution of my difficulties. Here among my drawings and\r\nhammerings _now_, I still question unanswering problems. All my life\r\nhas been at bottom, _seeking_, disbelieving always, dissatisfied always\r\nwith the thing seen and the thing believed, seeking something in toil,\r\nin force, in danger, something whose name and nature I do not clearly\r\nunderstand, something beautiful, worshipful, enduring, mine profoundly\r\nand fundamentally, and the utter redemption of myself; I don’t know—all\r\nI can tell is that it is something I have ever failed to find.\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nBut before I finish this chapter and book altogether and go on with the\r\ngreat adventure of my uncle’s career. I may perhaps tell what else\r\nremains to tell of Marion and Effie, and then for a time set my private\r\nlife behind me.\r\n\r\nFor a time Marion and I corresponded with some regularity, writing\r\nfriendly but rather uninforming letters about small business things.\r\nThe clumsy process of divorce completed itself.\r\n\r\nShe left the house at Ealing and went into the country with her aunt\r\nand parents, taking a small farm near Lewes in Sussex. She put up\r\nglass, she put in heat for her father, happy man! and spoke of figs and\r\npeaches. The thing seemed to promise well throughout a spring and\r\nsummer, but the Sussex winter after London was too much for the\r\nRamboats. They got very muddy and dull; Mr. Ramboat killed a cow by\r\nimproper feeding, and that disheartened them all. A twelvemonth saw the\r\nenterprise in difficulties. I had to help her out of this, and then\r\nthey returned to London and she went into partnership with Smithie at\r\nStreatham, and ran a business that was intimated on the firm’s\r\nstationery as “Robes.” The parents and aunt were stowed away in a\r\ncottage somewhere. After that the letters became infrequent. But in one\r\nI remember a postscript that had a little stab of our old intimacy:\r\n“Poor old Miggles is dead.”\r\n\r\nNearly eight years slipped by. I grew up. I grew in experience, in\r\ncapacity, until I was fully a man, but with many new interests, living\r\non a larger scale in a wider world than I could have dreamt of in my\r\nMarion days. Her letters become rare and insignificant. At last came a\r\ngap of silence that made me curious. For eighteen months or more I had\r\nnothing from Marion save her quarterly receipts through the bank. Then\r\nI damned at Smithie, and wrote a card to Marion.\r\n\r\n“Dear Marion,” I said, “how goes it?”\r\n\r\nShe astonished me tremendously by telling me she had married again—“a\r\nMr. Wachorn, a leading agent in the paper-pattern trade.” But she still\r\nwrote on the Ponderevo and Smith (Robes) notepaper, from the Ponderevo\r\nand Smith address.\r\n\r\nAnd that, except for a little difference of opinion about the\r\ncontinuance of alimony which gave me some passages of anger, and the\r\nuse of my name by the firm, which also annoyed me, is the end of\r\nMarion’s history for me, and she vanishes out of this story. I do not\r\nknow where she is or what she is doing. I do not know whether she is\r\nalive or dead. It seems to me utterly grotesque that two people who\r\nhave stood so close to one another as she and I should be so separated,\r\nbut so it is between us.\r\n\r\nEffie, too, I have parted from, though I still see her at times.\r\nBetween us there was never any intention of marriage nor intimacy of\r\nsoul. She had a sudden, fierce, hot-blooded passion for me and I for\r\nher, but I was not her first lover nor her last. She was in another\r\nworld from Marion. She had a queer, delightful nature; I’ve no memory\r\nof ever seeing her sullen or malicious. She was—indeed she was\r\nmagnificently—eupeptic. That, I think, was the central secret of her\r\nagreeableness, and, moreover, that she was infinitely kind-hearted. I\r\nhelped her at last into an opening she coveted, and she amazed me by a\r\nsudden display of business capacity. She has now a typewriting bureau\r\nin Riffle’s Inn, and she runs it with a brisk vigour and considerable\r\nsuccess, albeit a certain plumpness has overtaken her. And she still\r\nloves her kind. She married a year or so ago a boy half her age—a\r\nwretch of a poet, a wretched poet, and given to drugs, a thing with\r\nlank fair hair always getting into his blue eyes, and limp legs. She\r\ndid it, she said, because he needed nursing....\r\n\r\nBut enough of this disaster of my marriage and of my early love\r\naffairs; I have told all that is needed for my picture to explain how I\r\ncame to take up aeroplane experiments and engineering science; let me\r\nget back to my essential story, to Tono-Bungay and my uncle’s\r\npromotions and to the vision of the world these things have given me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD\r\nTHE GREAT DAYS OF TONO-BUNGAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST\r\nTHE HARDINGHAM HOTEL, AND HOW WE BECAME BIG PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBut now that I resume the main line of my story it may be well to\r\ndescribe the personal appearance of my uncle as I remember him during\r\nthose magnificent years that followed his passage from trade to\r\nfinance. The little man plumped up very considerably during the\r\ncreation of the Tono-Bungay property, but with the increasing\r\nexcitements that followed that first flotation came dyspepsia and a\r\ncertain flabbiness and falling away. His abdomen—if the reader will\r\npardon my taking his features in the order of their value—had at first\r\na nice full roundness, but afterwards it lost tone without, however,\r\nlosing size. He always went as though he was proud of it and would make\r\nas much of it as possible. To the last his movements remained quick and\r\nsudden, his short firm legs, as he walked, seemed to twinkle rather\r\nthan display the scissors-stride of common humanity, and he never\r\nseemed to have knees, but instead, a dispersed flexibility of limb.\r\n\r\nThere was, I seem to remember, a secular intensification of his\r\nfeatures; his nose developed character, became aggressive, stuck out at\r\nthe world more and more; the obliquity of his mouth, I think,\r\nincreased. From the face that returns to my memory projects a long\r\ncigar that is sometimes cocked jauntily up from the higher corner, that\r\nsometimes droops from the lower;—it was as eloquent as a dog’s tail,\r\nand he removed it only for the more emphatic modes of speech. He\r\nassumed a broad black ribbon for his glasses, and wore them more and\r\nmore askew as time went on. His hair seemed to stiffen with success,\r\nbut towards the climax it thinned greatly over the crown, and he\r\nbrushed it hard back over his ears where, however, it stuck out\r\nfiercely. It always stuck out fiercely over his forehead, up and\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nHe adopted an urban style of dressing with the onset of Tono-Bungay and\r\nrarely abandoned it. He preferred silk hats with ample rich brims,\r\noften a trifle large for him by modern ideas, and he wore them at\r\nvarious angles to his axis; his taste in trouserings was towards fairly\r\nemphatic stripes and his trouser cut was neat; he liked his frock-coat\r\nlong and full, although that seemed to shorten him. He displayed a\r\nnumber of valuable rings, and I remember one upon his left little\r\nfinger with a large red stone bearing Gnostic symbols. “Clever chaps,\r\nthose Gnostics, George,” he told me. “Means a lot. Lucky!” He never had\r\nany but a black mohair watch-chair. In the country he affected grey and\r\na large grey cloth top-hat, except when motoring; then he would have a\r\nbrown deer-stalker cap and a fur suit of esquimaux cut with a sort of\r\nboot-end to the trousers. Of an evening he would wear white waistcoats\r\nand plain gold studs. He hated diamonds. “Flashy,” he said they were.\r\n“Might as well wear—an income tax-receipt. All very well for Park Lane.\r\nUnsold stock. Not my style. Sober financier, George.”\r\n\r\nSo much for his visible presence. For a time it was very familiar to\r\nthe world, for at the crest of the boom he allowed quite a number of\r\nphotographs and at least one pencil sketch to be published in the\r\nsixpenny papers.\r\n\r\nHis voice declined during those years from his early tenor to a flat\r\nrich quality of sound that my knowledge of music is inadequate to\r\ndescribe. His Zzz-ing inrush of air became less frequent as he ripened,\r\nbut returned in moments of excitement. Throughout his career, in spite\r\nof his increasing and at last astounding opulence, his more intimate\r\nhabits remained as simple as they had been at Wimblehurst. He would\r\nnever avail himself of the services of a valet; at the very climax of\r\nhis greatness his trousers were folded by a housemaid and his shoulders\r\nbrushed as he left his house or hotel. He became wary about breakfast\r\nas life advanced, and at one time talked much of Dr. Haig and uric\r\nacid. But for other meals he remained reasonably omnivorous. He was\r\nsomething of a gastronome, and would eat anything he particularly liked\r\nin an audible manner, and perspire upon his forehead. He was a\r\nstudiously moderate drinker—except when the spirit of some public\r\nbanquet or some great occasion caught him and bore him beyond his\r\nwariness—there he would, as it were, drink inadvertently and become\r\nflushed and talkative—about everything but his business projects.\r\n\r\nTo make the portrait complete one wants to convey an effect of sudden,\r\nquick bursts of movement like the jumps of a Chinese-cracker to\r\nindicate that his pose whatever it is, has been preceded and will be\r\nfollowed by a rush. If I were painting him, I should certainly give him\r\nfor a background that distressed, uneasy sky that was popular in the\r\neighteenth century, and at a convenient distance a throbbing motor-car,\r\nvery big and contemporary, a secretary hurrying with papers, and an\r\nalert chauffeur.\r\n\r\nSuch was the figure that created and directed the great property of\r\nTono-Bungay, and from the successful reconstruction of that company\r\npassed on to a slow crescendo of magnificent creations and promotions\r\nuntil the whole world of investors marveled. I have already I think,\r\nmentioned how, long before we offered Tono Bungay to the public, we\r\ntook over the English agency of certain American specialties. To this\r\nwas presently added our exploitation of Moggs’ Domestic Soap, and so he\r\ntook up the Domestic Convenience Campaign that, coupled with his\r\nequatorial rotundity and a certain resolute convexity in his bearings\r\nwon my uncle his Napoleonic title.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt illustrates the romantic element in modern commerce that my uncle\r\nmet young Moggs at a city dinner—I think it was the Bottle-makers’\r\nCompany—when both were some way advanced beyond the initial sobriety of\r\nthe occasion. This was the grandson of the original Moggs, and a very\r\ntypical instance of an educated, cultivated, degenerate plutocrat. His\r\npeople had taken him about in his youth as the Ruskins took their John\r\nand fostered a passion for history in him, and the actual management of\r\nthe Moggs’ industry had devolved upon a cousin and a junior partner.\r\n\r\nMr. Moggs, being of a studious and refined disposition, had just\r\ndecided—after a careful search for a congenial subject in which he\r\nwould not be constantly reminded of soap—to devote himself to the\r\nHistory of the Thebaid, when this cousin died suddenly and precipitated\r\nresponsibilities upon him. In the frankness of conviviality, Moggs\r\nbewailed the uncongenial task thus thrust into his hands, and my uncle\r\noffered to lighten his burden by a partnership then and there. They\r\neven got to terms—extremely muzzy terms, but terms nevertheless.\r\n\r\nEach gentleman wrote the name and address of the other on his cuff, and\r\nthey separated in a mood of brotherly carelessness, and next morning\r\nneither seems to have thought to rescue his shirt from the wash until\r\nit was too late. My uncle made a painful struggle—it was one of my\r\nbusiness mornings—to recall name and particulars.\r\n\r\n“He was an aquarium-faced, long, blond sort of chap, George, with\r\nglasses and a genteel accent,” he said.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled. “Aquarium-faced?”\r\n\r\n“You know how they look at you. His stuff was soap, I’m pretty nearly\r\ncertain. And he had a name—And the thing was the straightest\r\nBit-of-All-right you ever. I was clear enough to spot that...”\r\n\r\nWe went out at last with knitted brows, and wandered up into Finsbury\r\nseeking a good, well-stocked looking grocer. We called first on a\r\nchemist for a pick-me-up for my uncle, and then we found the shop we\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n“I want,” said my uncle, “half a pound of every sort of soap you got.\r\nYes, I want to take them now. Wait a moment, George.... Now what sort\r\nof soap d’you call _that?_”\r\n\r\nAt the third repetition of that question the young man said, “Moggs’\r\nDomestic.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said my uncle. “You needn’t guess again. Come along, George,\r\nlet’s go to a telephone and get on to Moggs. Oh—the order? Certainly. I\r\nconfirm it. Send it all—send it all to the Bishop of London; he’ll have\r\nsome good use for it—(First-rate man, George, he is—charities and all\r\nthat)—and put it down to me, here’s a card—Ponderevo—Tono-Bungay.”\r\n\r\nThen we went on to Moggs and found him in a camel-hair dressing-jacket\r\nin a luxurious bed, drinking China tea, and got the shape of everything\r\nbut the figures fixed by lunch time.\r\n\r\nYoung Moggs enlarged my mind considerably; he was a sort of thing I\r\nhadn’t met before; he seemed quite clean and well-informed and he\r\nassured me to never read newspapers nor used soap in any form at all,\r\n“Delicate skin,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No objection to our advertising you wide and free?” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“I draw the line at railway stations,” said Moggs, “south-coast cliffs,\r\ntheatre programmes, books by me and poetry generally—scenery—oh!—and\r\nthe _Mercure de France_.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll get along,” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“So long as you don’t annoy me,” said Moggs, lighting a cigarette, “you\r\ncan make me as rich as you like.”\r\n\r\nWe certainly made him no poorer. His was the first firm that was\r\nadvertised by a circumstantial history; we even got to illustrated\r\nmagazine articles telling of the quaint past of Moggs. We concocted\r\nMoggsiana. Trusting to our partner’s preoccupation with the\r\nuncommercial aspects of life, we gave graceful history—of Moggs the\r\nFirst, Moggs the Second, Moggs the Third, and Moggs the Fourth. You\r\nmust, unless you are very young, remember some of them and our\r\nadmirable block of a Georgian shop window. My uncle brought early\r\nnineteenth-century memoirs, soaked himself in the style, and devised\r\nstories about old Moggs the First and the Duke of Wellington, George\r\nthe Third and the soap dealer (“almost certainly old Moggs”). Very soon\r\nwe had added to the original Moggs’ Primrose several varieties of\r\nscented and superfatted, a “special nurseries used in the household of\r\nthe Duke of Kent and for the old Queen in Infancy,” a plate powder,\r\n“the Paragon,” and a knife powder. We roped in a good little\r\nsecond-rate black-lead firm, and carried their origins back into the\r\nmists of antiquity. It was my uncle’s own unaided idea that we should\r\nassociate that commodity with the Black Prince. He became industriously\r\ncurious about the past of black-lead. I remember his button-holing the\r\npresident of the Pepys Society.\r\n\r\n“I say, is there any black-lead in Pepys? You know—black-lead—for\r\ngrates! _Or does he pass it over as a matter of course?_”\r\n\r\nHe became in those days the terror of eminent historians. “Don’t want\r\nyour drum and trumpet history—no fear,” he used to say. “Don’t want to\r\nknow who was who’s mistress, and why so-and-so devastated such a\r\nprovince; that’s bound to be all lies and upsy-down anyhow. Not my\r\naffair. Nobody’s affair now. Chaps who did it didn’t clearly know....\r\nWhat I want to know is, in the Middle Ages, did they do anything for\r\nHousemaid’s Knee? What did they put in their hot baths after jousting,\r\nand was the Black Prince—you know the Black Prince—was he enameled or\r\npainted, or what? I think myself, black-leaded—very likely—like\r\npipe-clay—but _did_ they use blacking so early?”\r\n\r\nSo it came about that in designing and writing those Moggs’ Soap\r\nAdvertisements, that wrought a revolution in that department of\r\nliterature, my uncle was brought to realise not only the lost history,\r\nbut also the enormous field for invention and enterprise that lurked\r\namong the little articles, the dustpans and mincers, the mousetraps and\r\ncarpet-sweepers that fringe the shops of the oilman and domestic\r\nironmonger. He was recalled to one of the dreams of his youth, to his\r\nconception of the Ponderevo Patent Flat that had been in his mind so\r\nearly as the days before I went to serve him at Wimblehurst. “The Home,\r\nGeorge,” he said, “wants straightening up. Silly muddle! Things that\r\nget in the way. Got to organise it.”\r\n\r\nFor a time he displayed something like the zeal of a genuine social\r\nreformer in relation to these matters.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to bring the Home Up to Date? That’s my idee, George. We got\r\nto make a civilised domestic machine out of these relics of barbarism.\r\nI’m going to hunt up inventors, make a corner in d’mestic ideas.\r\nEverything. Balls of string that won’t dissolve into a tangle, and gum\r\nthat won’t dry into horn. See? Then after conveniences—beauty. Beauty,\r\nGeorge! All these few things ought to be made fit to look at; it’s your\r\naunt’s idea, that. Beautiful jam-pots! Get one of those new art chaps\r\nto design all the things they make ugly now. Patent carpet-sweepers by\r\nthese greenwood chaps, housemaid’s boxes it’ll be a pleasure to fall\r\nover—rich coloured house-flannels. Zzzz. Pails, f’rinstance. Hang ’em\r\nup on the walls like warming-pans. All the polishes and things in such\r\ntins—you’ll want to cuddle ’em, George! See the notion? ‘Sted of all\r\nthe silly ugly things we got.”...\r\n\r\nWe had some magnificent visions; they so affected me that when I passed\r\nironmongers and oil-shops they seemed to me as full of promise as trees\r\nin late winter, flushed with the effort to burst into leaf and\r\nflower.... And really we did do much towards that very brightness these\r\nshops display. They were dingy things in the eighties compared to what\r\nour efforts have made them now, grey quiet displays.\r\n\r\nWell, I don’t intend to write down here the tortuous financial history\r\nof Moggs’ Limited, which was our first development of Moggs and Sons;\r\nnor will I tell very much of how from that we spread ourselves with a\r\nlarger and larger conception throughout the chandlery and minor\r\nironmongery, how we became agents for this little commodity, partners\r\nin that, got a tentacle round the neck of a specialised manufacturer or\r\nso, secured a pull upon this or that supply of raw material, and so\r\nprepared the way for our second flotation, Domestic Utilities; “Do it,”\r\nthey reordered it in the city. And then came the reconstruction of\r\nTono-Bungay, and then “Household services” and the Boom!\r\n\r\nThat sort of development is not to be told in detail in a novel. I\r\nhave, indeed, told much of it elsewhere. It is to be found set out at\r\nlength, painfully at length, in my uncle’s examination and mine in the\r\nbankruptcy proceedings, and in my own various statements after his\r\ndeath. Some people know everything in that story, some know it all too\r\nwell, most do not want the details, it is the story of a man of\r\nimagination among figures, and unless you are prepared to collate\r\ncolumns of pounds, shillings and pence, compare dates and check\r\nadditions, you will find it very unmeaning and perplexing. And after\r\nall, you wouldn’t find the early figures so much wrong as _strained_.\r\nIn the matter of Moggs and Do Ut, as in the first Tono-Bungay promotion\r\nand in its reconstruction, we left the court by city standards without\r\na stain on our characters. The great amalgamation of Household Services\r\nwas my uncle’s first really big-scale enterprise and his first display\r\nof bolder methods: for this we bought back Do Ut, Moggs (going strong\r\nwith a seven per cent. dividend) and acquired Skinnerton’s polishes,\r\nthe Riffleshaw properties and the Runcorn’s mincer and coffee-mill\r\nbusiness. To that Amalgamation I was really not a party; I left it to\r\nmy uncle because I was then beginning to get keen upon the soaring\r\nexperiments I had taken on from the results then to hand of Lilienthal,\r\nPilcher and the Wright brothers. I was developing a glider into a\r\nflyer. I meant to apply power to this glider as soon as I could work\r\nout one or two residual problems affecting the longitudinal stability.\r\nI knew that I had a sufficiently light motor in my own modification of\r\nBridger’s light turbine, but I knew too that until I had cured my\r\naeroplane of a tendency demanding constant alertness from me, a\r\ntendency to jerk up its nose at unexpected moments and slide back upon\r\nme, the application of an engine would be little short of suicide.\r\n\r\nBut that I will tell about later. The point I was coming to was that I\r\ndid not realise until after the crash how recklessly my uncle had kept\r\nhis promise of paying a dividend of over eight per cent. on the\r\nordinary shares of that hugely over-capitalised enterprise, Household\r\nServices.\r\n\r\nI drifted out of business affairs into my research much more than\r\neither I or my uncle had contemplated. Finance was much less to my\r\ntaste than the organisation of the Tono-Bungay factory. In the new\r\nfield of enterprise there was a great deal of bluffing and gambling, of\r\ntaking chances and concealing material facts—and these are hateful\r\nthings to the scientific type of mind. It wasn’t fear I felt so much as\r\nan uneasy inaccuracy. I didn’t realise dangers, I simply disliked the\r\nsloppy, relaxing quality of this new sort of work. I was at last\r\nconstantly making excuses not to come up to him in London. The latter\r\npart of his business career recedes therefore beyond the circle of any\r\nparticular life. I lived more or less with him; I talked, I advised, I\r\nhelped him at times to fight his Sunday crowd at Crest Hill, but I did\r\nnot follow nor guide him. From the Do Ut time onward he rushed up the\r\nfinancial world like a bubble in water and left me like some busy\r\nwater-thing down below in the deeps.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, he was an immense success. The public was, I think,\r\nparticularly attracted by the homely familiarity of his field of\r\nwork—you never lost sight of your investment they felt, with the name\r\non the house-flannel and shaving-strop—and its allegiance was secured\r\nby the Egyptian solidity of his apparent results. Tono-Bungay, after\r\nits reconstruction, paid thirteen, Moggs seven, Domestic Utilities had\r\nbeen a safe-looking nine; here was Household Services with eight; on\r\nsuch a showing he had merely to buy and sell Roeburn’s Antiseptic\r\nfluid, Razor soaks and Bath crystals in three weeks to clear twenty\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nI do think that as a matter of fact Roeburn’s was good value at the\r\nprice at which he gave it to the public, at least until it was strained\r\nby ill-conserved advertisement. It was a period of expansion and\r\nconfidence; much money was seeking investment and “Industrials” were\r\nthe fashion. Prices were rising all round. There remained little more\r\nfor my uncle to do therefore, in his climb to the high unstable crest\r\nof Financial Greatness but, as he said, to “grasp the cosmic oyster,\r\nGeorge, while it gaped,” which, being translated, meant for him to buy\r\nrespectable businesses confidently and courageously at the vendor’s\r\nestimate, add thirty or forty thousand to the price and sell them\r\nagain. His sole difficulty indeed was the tactful management of the\r\nload of shares that each of these transactions left upon his hands. But\r\nI thought so little of these later things that I never fully\r\nappreciated the peculiar inconveniences of that until it was too late\r\nto help him.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhen I think of my uncle near the days of his Great Boom and in\r\nconnection with the actualities of his enterprises, I think of him as I\r\nused to see him in the suite of rooms he occupied in the Hardingham\r\nHotel, seated at a great old oak writing-table, smoking, drinking, and\r\nincoherently busy; that was his typical financial aspect—our evenings,\r\nour mornings, our holidays, our motor-car expeditions, Lady Grove and\r\nCrest Hill belong to an altogether different set of memories.\r\n\r\nThese rooms in the Hardingham were a string of apartments along one\r\nhandsome thick-carpeted corridor. All the doors upon the corridor were\r\nlocked except the first; and my uncle’s bedroom, breakfast-room and\r\nprivate sanctum were the least accessible and served by an entrance\r\nfrom the adjacent passage, which he also used at times as a means of\r\nescape from importunate callers. The most eternal room was a general\r\nwaiting-room and very business-like in quality; it had one or two\r\nuneasy sofas, a number of chairs, a green baize table, and a collection\r\nof the very best Moggs and Tone posters: and the plush carpets normal\r\nto the Hardingham had been replaced by a grey-green cork linoleum; Here\r\nI would always find a remarkable miscellany of people presided over by\r\na peculiarly faithful and ferocious looking commissioner, Ropper, who\r\nguarded the door that led a step nearer my uncle. Usually there would\r\nbe a parson or so, and one or two widows; hairy, eyeglassy, middle-aged\r\ngentlemen, some of them looking singularly like Edward Ponderevos who\r\nhadn’t come off, a variety of young and youngish men more or less\r\nattractively dressed, some with papers protruding from their pockets,\r\nothers with their papers decently concealed. And wonderful, incidental,\r\nfrowsy people.\r\n\r\nAll these persons maintained a practically hopeless siege—sometimes for\r\nweeks together; they had better have stayed at home. Next came a room\r\nfull of people who had some sort of appointment, and here one would\r\nfind smart-looking people, brilliantly dressed, nervous women hiding\r\nbehind magazines, nonconformist divines, clergy in gaiters, real\r\nbusiness men, these latter for the most part gentlemen in admirable\r\nmorning dress who stood up and scrutinised my uncle’s taste in water\r\ncolours manfully and sometimes by the hour together. Young men again\r\nwere here of various social origins, young Americans, treasonable\r\nclerks from other concerns, university young men, keen-looking, most of\r\nthem, resolute, reserved, but on a sort of hair trigger, ready at any\r\nmoment to be most voluble, most persuasive.\r\n\r\nThis room had a window, too, looking out into the hotel courtyard with\r\nits fern-set fountains and mosaic pavement, and the young men would\r\nstand against this and sometimes even mutter. One day I heard one\r\nrepeating in all urgent whisper as I passed “But you don’t quite see,\r\nMr. Ponderevo, the full advantages, the _full_ advantages—” I met his\r\neye and he was embarrassed.\r\n\r\nThen came a room with a couple of secretaries—no typewriters, because\r\nmy uncle hated the clatter—and a casual person or two sitting about,\r\nprojectors whose projects were being entertained. Here and in a further\r\nroom nearer the private apartments, my uncle’s correspondence underwent\r\nan exhaustive process of pruning and digestion before it reached him.\r\nThen the two little rooms in which my uncle talked; my magic uncle who\r\nhad got the investing public—to whom all things were possible. As one\r\ncame in we would find him squatting with his cigar up and an expression\r\nof dubious beatitude upon his face, while some one urged him to grow\r\nstill richer by this or that.\r\n\r\n“That’ju, George?” he used to say. “Come in. Here’s a thing. Tell\r\nhim—Mister—over again. Have a drink, George? No! Wise man! Liss’n.”\r\n\r\nI was always ready to listen. All sorts of financial marvels came out\r\nof the Hardingham, more particularly during my uncle’s last great\r\nflurry, but they were nothing to the projects that passed in. It was\r\nthe little brown and gold room he sat in usually. He had had it\r\nredecorated by Bordingly and half a dozen Sussex pictures by Webster\r\nhung about it. Latterly he wore a velveteen jacket of a golden-brown\r\ncolour in this apartment that I think over-emphasised its esthetic\r\nintention, and he also added some gross Chinese bronzes.\r\n\r\nHe was, on the whole, a very happy man throughout all that wildly\r\nenterprising time. He made and, as I shall tell in its place, spent\r\ngreat sums of money. He was constantly in violent motion, constantly\r\nstimulated mentally and physically and rarely tired. About him was an\r\natmosphere of immense deference much of his waking life was triumphal\r\nand all his dreams. I doubt if he had any dissatisfaction with himself\r\nat all until the crash bore him down. Things must have gone very\r\nrapidly with him.... I think he must have been very happy.\r\n\r\nAs I sit here writing about all these things, jerking down notes and\r\nthrowing them aside in my attempt to give some literary form to the\r\ntale of our promotions, the marvel of it all comes to me as if it came\r\nfor the first time the supreme unreason of it. At the climax of his\r\nBoom, my uncle at the most sparing estimate must have possessed in\r\nsubstance and credit about two million pounds’-worth of property to set\r\noff against his vague colossal liabilities, and from first to last he\r\nmust have had a controlling influence in the direction of nearly thirty\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThis irrational muddle of a community in which we live gave him that,\r\npaid him at that rate for sitting in a room and scheming and telling it\r\nlies. For he created nothing, he invented nothing, he economised\r\nnothing. I cannot claim that a single one of the great businesses we\r\norganised added any real value to human life at all. Several like\r\nTono-Bungay were unmitigated frauds by any honest standard, the giving\r\nof nothing coated in advertisements for money. And the things the\r\nHardingham gave out, I repeat, were nothing to the things that came in.\r\nI think of the long procession of people who sat down before us and\r\npropounded this and that. Now it was a device for selling bread under a\r\nfancy name and so escaping the laws as to weight—this was afterwards\r\nfloated as the Decorticated Health-Bread Company and bumped against the\r\nlaw—now it was a new scheme for still more strident advertisement, now\r\nit was a story of unsuspected deposits of minerals, now a cheap and\r\nnasty substitute for this or that common necessity, now the treachery\r\nof a too well-informed employee, anxious to become our partner. It was\r\nall put to us tentatively, persuasively. Sometimes one had a large pink\r\nblusterous person trying to carry us off our feet by his pseudo-boyish\r\nfrankness, now some dyspeptically yellow whisperer, now some earnest,\r\nspecially dressed youth with an eye-glass and a buttonhole, now some\r\nhomely-speaking, shrewd Manchester man or some Scotchman eager to be\r\nvery clear and full.\r\n\r\nMany came in couples or trios, often in tow of an explanatory\r\nsolicitor. Some were white and earnest, some flustered beyond measure\r\nat their opportunity. Some of them begged and prayed to be taken up. My\r\nuncle chose what he wanted and left the rest. He became very autocratic\r\nto these applicants.\r\n\r\nHe felt he could make them, and they felt so too. He had but to say\r\n“No!” and they faded out of existence.... He had become a sort of\r\nvortex to which wealth flowed of its own accord. His possessions\r\nincreased by heaps; his shares, his leaseholds and mortgages and\r\ndebentures.\r\n\r\nBehind his first-line things he found it necessary at last, and\r\nsanctioned by all the precincts, to set up three general trading\r\ncompanies, the London and African Investment Company, the British\r\nTraders’ Loan Company, and Business Organisations Limited. This was in\r\nthe culminating time when I had least to do with affairs. I don’t say\r\nthat with any desire to exculpate myself; I admit I was a director of\r\nall three, and I will confess I was willfully incurious in that\r\ncapacity. Each of these companies ended its financial year solvent by\r\nselling great holdings of shares to one or other of its sisters, and\r\npaying a dividend out of the proceeds. I sat at the table and agreed.\r\nThat was our method of equilibrium at the iridescent climax of the\r\nbubble.\r\n\r\nYou perceive now, however, the nature of the services for which this\r\nfantastic community have him unmanageable wealth and power and real\r\nrespect. It was all a monstrous payment for courageous fiction, a\r\ngratuity in return for the one reality of human life—illusion. We gave\r\nthem a feeling of hope and profit; we sent a tidal wave of water and\r\nconfidence into their stranded affairs. “We mint Faith, George,” said\r\nmy uncle one day. “That’s what we do. And by Jove we got to keep\r\nminting! We been making human confidence ever since I drove the first\r\ncork of Tono-Bungay.”\r\n\r\n“Coining” would have been a better word than minting! And yet, you\r\nknow, in a sense he was right. Civilisation is possible only through\r\nconfidence, so that we can bank our money and go unarmed about the\r\nstreets. The bank reserve or a policeman keeping order in a jostling\r\nmultitude of people, are only slightly less impudent bluffs than my\r\nuncle’s prospectuses. They couldn’t for a moment “make good” if the\r\nquarter of what they guarantee was demanded of them. The whole of this\r\nmodern mercantile investing civilisation is indeed such stuff as dreams\r\nare made of. A mass of people swelters and toils, great railway systems\r\ngrow, cities arise to the skies and spread wide and far, mines are\r\nopened, factories hum, foundries roar, ships plough the seas, countries\r\nare settled; about this busy striving world the rich owners go,\r\ncontrolling all, enjoying all, confident and creating the confidence\r\nthat draws us all together into a reluctant, nearly unconscious\r\nbrotherhood. I wonder and plan my engines. The flags flutter, the\r\ncrowds cheer, the legislatures meet. Yet it seems to me indeed at times\r\nthat all this present commercial civilisation is no more than my poor\r\nuncle’s career writ large, a swelling, thinning bubble of assurances;\r\nthat its arithmetic is just as unsound, its dividends as ill-advised,\r\nits ultimate aim as vague and forgotten; that it all drifts on perhaps\r\nto some tremendous parallel to his individual disaster...\r\n\r\nWell, so it was we Boomed, and for four years and a half we lived a\r\nlife of mingled substance and moonshine. Until our particular\r\nunsoundness overtook us we went about in the most magnificent of\r\nmotor-cars upon tangible high roads, made ourselves conspicuous and\r\nstately in splendid houses, ate sumptuously and had a perpetual stream\r\nof notes and money trickling into our pockets; hundreds of thousands of\r\nmen and women respected us, saluted us and gave us toil and honour; I\r\nasked, and my worksheets rose, my aeroplanes swooped out of nothingness\r\nto scare the downland pe-wits; my uncle waved his hand and Lady Grove\r\nand all its associations of chivalry and ancient peace were his; waved\r\nagain, and architects were busy planning the great palace he never\r\nfinished at Crest Hill and an army of folkmen gathered to do his\r\nbidding, blue marble came from Canada, and timber from New Zealand; and\r\nbeneath it all, you know, there was nothing but fictitious values as\r\nevanescent as rainbow gold.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI pass the Hardingham ever and again and glance aside through the great\r\narchway at the fountain and the ferns, and think of those receding days\r\nwhen I was so near the centre of our eddy of greed and enterprise. I\r\nsee again my uncle’s face, white and intent, and hear him discourse,\r\nhear him make consciously Napoleonic decisions, “grip” his nettles, put\r\nhis “finger on the spot,” “bluff,” say “snap.” He became particularly\r\naddicted to the last idiom. Towards the end every conceivable act took\r\nthe form of saying “snap!”\r\n\r\nThe odd fish that came to us! And among others came Gordon-Nasmyth,\r\nthat queer blend of romance and illegality who was destined to drag me\r\ninto the most irrelevant adventure in my life the Mordet Island affair;\r\nand leave me, as they say, with blood upon my hands. It is remarkable\r\nhow little it troubles my conscience and how much it stirs my\r\nimagination, that particular memory of the life I took. The story of\r\nMordet Island has been told in a government report and told all wrong;\r\nthere are still excellent reasons for leaving it wrong in places, but\r\nthe liveliest appeals of discretion forbid my leaving it out\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nI’ve still the vividest memory of Gordon-Nasmyth’s appearance in the\r\ninner sanctum, a lank, sunburnt person in tweeds with a yellow-brown\r\nhatchet face and one faded blue eye—the other was a closed and sunken\r\nlid—and how he told us with a stiff affectation of ease his incredible\r\nstory of this great heap of quap that lay abandoned or undiscovered on\r\nthe beach behind Mordet’s Island among white dead mangroves and the\r\nblack ooze of brackish water.\r\n\r\n“What’s quap?” said my uncle on the fourth repetition of the word.\r\n\r\n“They call it quap, or quab, or quabb,” said Gordon-Nasmyth; “but our\r\nrelations weren’t friendly enough to get the accent right....\r\n\r\n“But there the stuff is for the taking. They don’t know about it.\r\nNobody knows about it. I got down to the damned place in a canoe alone.\r\nThe boys wouldn’t come. I pretended to be botanising.” ...\r\n\r\nTo begin with, Gordon-Nasmyth was inclined to be dramatic.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” he said when he first came in, shutting the door rather\r\ncarefully behind him as he spoke, “do you two men—yes or no—want to put\r\nup six thousand—for—a clear good chance of fifteen hundred per cent. on\r\nyour money in a year?”\r\n\r\n“We’re always getting chances like that,” said my uncle, cocking his\r\ncigar offensively, wiping his glasses and tilting his chair back. “We\r\nstick to a safe twenty.”\r\n\r\nGordon-Nasmyth’s quick temper showed in a slight stiffening of his\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you believe him,” said I, getting up before he could reply.\r\n“You’re different, and I know your books. We’re very glad you’ve come\r\nto us. Confound it, uncle! Its Gordon-Nasmyth! Sit down. What is it?\r\nMinerals?”\r\n\r\n“Quap,” said Gordon-Nasmyth, fixing his eye on me, “in heaps.”\r\n\r\n“In heaps,” said my uncle softly, with his glasses very oblique.\r\n\r\n“You’re only fit for the grocery,” said Gordon-Nasmyth scornfully,\r\nsitting down and helping himself to one of my uncle’s cigars. “I’m\r\nsorry I came. But, still, now I’m here.... And first as to quap; quap,\r\nsir, is the most radio-active stuff in the world. That’s quap! It’s a\r\nfestering mass of earths and heavy metals, polonium, radium, ythorium,\r\nthorium, carium, and new things, too. There’s a stuff called\r\nXk—provisionally. There they are, mucked up together in a sort of\r\nrotting sand. What it is, how it got made, I don’t know. It’s like as\r\nif some young creator had been playing about there. There it lies in\r\ntwo heaps, one small, one great, and the world for miles about it is\r\nblasted and scorched and dead. You can have it for the getting. You’ve\r\ngot to take it—that’s all!”\r\n\r\n“That sounds all right,” said I. “Have you samples?”\r\n\r\n“Well—_should_ I? You can have anything—up to two ounces.”\r\n\r\n“Where is it?”...\r\n\r\nHis blue eye smiled at me and scrutinised me. He smoked and was\r\nfragmentary for a time, fending off my questions; then his story began\r\nto piece itself together. He conjured up a vision of this strange\r\nforgotten kink in the world’s littoral, of the long meandering channels\r\nthat spread and divaricate and spend their burden of mud and silt\r\nwithin the thunderbelt of Atlantic surf, of the dense tangled\r\nvegetation that creeps into the shimmering water with root and sucker.\r\nHe gave a sense of heat and a perpetual reek of vegetable decay, and\r\ntold how at last comes a break among these things, an arena fringed\r\nwith bone-white dead trees, a sight of the hard-blue sea line beyond\r\nthe dazzling surf and a wide desolation of dirty shingle and mud,\r\nbleached and scarred.... A little way off among charred dead weeds\r\nstands the abandoned station,—abandoned because every man who stayed\r\ntwo months at that station stayed to die, eaten up mysteriously like a\r\nleper with its dismantled sheds and its decaying pier of wormrotten and\r\noblique piles and planks, still insecurely possible.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst, two clumsy heaps shaped like the backs of hogs, one\r\nsmall, one great, sticking out under a rib of rock that cuts the space\r\nacross,—quap!\r\n\r\n“There it is,” said Gordon-Nasmyth, “worth three pounds an ounce, if\r\nit’s worth a penny; two great heaps of it, rotten stuff and soft, ready\r\nto shovel and wheel, and you may get it by the ton!”\r\n\r\n“How did it get there?”\r\n\r\n“God knows! ... There it is—for the taking! In a country where you\r\nmustn’t trade. In a country where the company waits for good kind men\r\nto find it riches and then take ’em away from ’em. There you have\r\nit—derelict.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you do any sort of deal?”\r\n\r\n“They’re too damned stupid. You’ve got to go and take it. That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“They might catch you.”\r\n\r\n“They might, of course. But they’re not great at catching.”\r\n\r\nWe went into the particulars of that difficulty. “They wouldn’t catch\r\nme, because I’d sink first. Give me a yacht,” said Gordon-Nasmyth;\r\n“that’s all I need.”\r\n\r\n“But if you get caught,” said my uncle.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think Gordon-Nasmyth imagined we would give him a\r\ncheque for six thousand pounds on the strength of his talk. It was very\r\ngood talk, but we didn’t do that. I stipulated for samples of his stuff\r\nfor analysis, and he consented—reluctantly.\r\n\r\nI think, on the whole, he would rather I didn’t examine samples. He\r\nmade a motion pocketwards, that gave us an invincible persuasion that\r\nhe had a sample upon him, and that at the last instant he decided not\r\nto produce it prematurely.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently a curious strain of secretiveness in him. He didn’t\r\nlike to give us samples, and he wouldn’t indicate within three hundred\r\nmiles the position of this Mordet Island of his. He had it clear in his\r\nmind that he had a secret of immense value, and he had no idea at all\r\nof just how far he ought to go with business people. And so presently,\r\nto gain time for these hesitations of his, he began to talk of other\r\nthings. He talked very well. He talked of the Dutch East Indies and of\r\nthe Congo, of Portuguese East Africa and Paraguay, of Malays and rich\r\nChinese merchants, Dyaks and negroes and the spread of the Mahometan\r\nworld in Africa to-day. And all this time he was trying to judge if we\r\nwere good enough to trust with his adventure. Our cosy inner office\r\nbecame a little place, and all our business cold and lifeless exploits\r\nbeside his glimpses of strange minglings of men, of slayings unavenged\r\nand curious customs, of trade where no writs run, and the dark\r\ntreacheries of eastern ports and uncharted channels.\r\n\r\nWe had neither of us gone abroad except for a few vulgar raids on\r\nParis; our world was England, are the places of origin of half the raw\r\nmaterial of the goods we sold had seemed to us as remote as fairyland\r\nor the forest of Arden. But Gordon-Nasmyth made it so real and intimate\r\nfor us that afternoon—for me, at any rate—that it seemed like something\r\nseen and forgotten and now again remembered.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end he produced his sample, a little lump of muddy clay\r\nspeckled with brownish grains, in a glass bottle wrapped about with\r\nlead and flannel—red flannel it was, I remember—a hue which is, I know,\r\npopularly supposed to double all the mystical efficacies of flannel.\r\n\r\n“Don’t carry it about on you,” said Gordon-Nasmyth. “It makes a sore.”\r\n\r\nI took the stuff to Thorold, and Thorold had the exquisite agony of\r\ndiscovering two new elements in what was then a confidential analysis.\r\nHe has christened them and published since, but at the time\r\nGordon-Nasmyth wouldn’t hear for a moment of our publication of any\r\nfacts at all; indeed, he flew into a violent passion and abused me\r\nmercilessly even for showing the stuff to Thorold. “I thought you were\r\ngoing to analyse it yourself,” he said with the touching persuasion of\r\nthe layman that a scientific man knows and practises at the sciences.\r\n\r\nI made some commercial inquiries, and there seemed even then much truth\r\nin Gordon-Nasmyth’s estimate of the value of the stuff. It was before\r\nthe days of Capern’s discovery of the value of canadium and his use of\r\nit in the Capern filament, but the cerium and thorium alone were worth\r\nthe money he extracted for the gas-mantles then in vogue. There were,\r\nhowever, doubts. Indeed, there were numerous doubts. What were the\r\nlimits of the gas-mantle trade? How much thorium, not to speak of\r\ncerium, could they take at a maximum. Suppose that quantity was high\r\nenough to justify our shipload, came doubts in another quarter. Were\r\nthe heaps up to sample? Were they as big as he said? Was\r\nGordon-Nasmyth—imaginative? And if these values held, could we after\r\nall get the stuff? It wasn’t ours. It was on forbidden ground. You see,\r\nthere were doubts of every grade and class in the way of this\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nWe went some way, nevertheless, in the discussion of his project,\r\nthough I think we tried his patience. Then suddenly he vanished from\r\nLondon, and I saw no more of him for a year and a half.\r\n\r\nMy uncle said that was what he had expected, and when at last\r\nGordon-Nasmyth reappeared and mentioned in an incidental way that he\r\nhad been to Paraguay on private (and we guessed passionate) affairs,\r\nthe business of the “quap” expedition had to be begun again at the\r\nbeginning. My uncle was disposed to be altogether sceptical, but I\r\nwasn’t so decided. I think I was drawn by its picturesque aspects. But\r\nwe neither of us dreamt of touching it seriously until Capern’s\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nNasmyth’s story had laid hold of my imagination like one small, intense\r\npicture of tropical sunshine hung on a wall of grey business affairs. I\r\nkept it going during Gordon-Nasmyth’s intermittent appearances in\r\nEngland. Every now and then he and I would meet and reinforce its\r\neffect. We would lunch in London, or he would cone to see my gliders at\r\nCrest Hill, and make new projects for getting at those heaps again now\r\nwith me, now alone.\r\n\r\nAt times they became a sort of fairy-story with us, an imaginative\r\nexercise. And there came Capern’s discovery of what he called the ideal\r\nfilament and with it an altogether less problematical quality about the\r\nbusiness side of quap. For the ideal filament needed five per cent. of\r\ncanadium, and canadium was known to the world only as a newly separated\r\nconstituent of a variety of the rare mineral rutile. But to Thorold it\r\nwas better known as an element in a mysterious sample brought to him by\r\nme, and to me it was known as one of the elements in quap. I told my\r\nuncle, and we jumped on to the process at once. We found that\r\nGordon-Nasmyth, still unaware of the altered value of the stuff, and\r\nstill thinking of the experimental prices of radium and the rarity\r\nvalue of cerium, had got hold of a cousin named Pollack, made some\r\nextraordinary transaction about his life insurance policy, and was\r\nbuying a brig. We put in, put down three thousand pounds, and forthwith\r\nthe life insurance transaction and the Pollack side of this finance\r\nvanished into thin air, leaving Pollack, I regret to say, in the brig\r\nand in the secret—except so far as canadium and the filament went—as\r\nresiduum. We discussed earnestly whether we should charter a steamer or\r\ngo on with the brig, but we decided on the brig as a less conspicuous\r\ninstrument for an enterprise that was after all, to put it plainly,\r\nstealing.\r\n\r\nBut that was one of our last enterprises before our great crisis, and I\r\nwill tell of it in its place.\r\n\r\nSo it was quap came into our affairs, came in as a fairy-tale and\r\nbecame real. More and more real it grew until at last it was real,\r\nuntil at last I saw with my eyes the heaps my imagination had seen for\r\nso long, and felt between my fingers again that half-gritty, half soft\r\ntexture of quap, like sanded moist-sugar mixed with clay in which there\r\nstirs something—\r\n\r\nOne must feel it to understand.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAll sorts of things came to the Hardingham and offered themselves to my\r\nuncle. Gordon-Nasmyth stands but only because he played a part at last\r\nin the crisis of our fortunes. So much came to us that it seemed to me\r\nat times as though the whole world of human affairs was ready to\r\nprostitute itself to our real and imaginary millions. As I look back, I\r\nam still dazzled and incredulous to think of the quality of our\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nWe did the most extraordinary things; things that it seems absurd to me\r\nto leave to any casual man of wealth and enterprise who cares to do\r\nthem. I had some amazing perceptions of just how modern thought and the\r\nsupply of fact to the general mind may be controlled by money. Among\r\nother things that my uncle offered for, he tried very hard to buy the\r\n_British Medical Journal_ and the _Lancet_, and run them on what he\r\ncalled modern lines, and when they resisted him he talked very\r\nvigorously for a time of organising a rival enterprise. That was a very\r\nmagnificent idea indeed in its way; it would have given a tremendous\r\nadvantage in the handling of innumerable specialties and indeed I\r\nscarcely know how far it would not have put the medical profession in\r\nour grip. It still amazes me—I shall die amazed—that such a thing can\r\nbe possible in the modern state. If my uncle failed to bring the thing\r\noff, some one else may succeed. But I doubt, even if he had got both\r\nthese weeklies, whether his peculiar style would have suited them. The\r\nchange of purpose would have shown. He would have found it difficult to\r\nkeep up their dignity.\r\n\r\nHe certainly did not keep up the dignity of the _Sacred Grove_, an\r\nimportant critical organ which he acquired one day—by saying “snap”—for\r\neight hundred pounds. He got it “lock, stock and barrel”—under one or\r\nother of which three aspects the editor was included. Even at that\r\nprice it didn’t pay. If you are a literary person you will remember the\r\nbright new cover he gave that representative organ of British\r\nintellectual culture, and how his sound business instincts jarred with\r\nthe exalted pretensions of a vanishing age. One old wrapper I\r\ndiscovered the other day runs:—\r\n\r\n“THE SACRED GROVE.”\r\n\r\n_A Weekly Magazine of Art, Philosophy, Science and Belles Lettres._\r\n\r\nHAVE YOU A NASTY TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH?\r\nIT IS LIVER.\r\n\r\nYOU NEED ONE TWENTY-THREE PILL.\r\n(JUST ONE.)\r\nNOT A DRUG BUT A LIVE AMERICAN REMEDY.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nA Hitherto Unpublished Letter from Walter Pater.\r\nCharlotte Brontë’s Maternal Great Aunt.\r\nA New Catholic History of England.\r\nThe Genius of Shakespeare.\r\nCorrespondence:—The Mendelian Hypothesis; The Split Infinitive;\r\n“Commence,” or “Begin;” Claverhouse; Socialism and the Individual; The\r\nDignity of Letters.\r\nFolk-lore Gossip.\r\nThe Stage; the Paradox of Acting.\r\nTravel Biography, Verse, Fiction, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE BEST PILL IN THE WORLD FOR AN IRREGULAR LIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose it is some lingering traces of the Bladesover tradition to me\r\nthat makes this combination of letters and pills seem so incongruous,\r\njust as I suppose it is a lingering trace of Plutarch and my\r\nineradicable boyish imagination that at bottom our State should be\r\nwise, sane and dignified, that makes me think a country which leaves\r\nits medical and literary criticism, or indeed any such vitally\r\nimportant criticism, entirely to private enterprise and open to the\r\nadvances of any purchaser must be in a frankly hopeless condition.\r\nThese are ideal conceptions of mine.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, nothing would be more entirely natural and\r\nrepresentative of the relations of learning, thought and the economic\r\nsituation in the world at the present time than this cover of the\r\n_Sacred Grove_—the quiet conservatism of the one element embedded in\r\nthe aggressive brilliance of the other; the contrasted notes of bold\r\nphysiological experiment and extreme mental immobility.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThere comes back, too, among these Hardingham memories, an impression\r\nof a drizzling November day, and how we looked out of the windows upon\r\na procession of the London unemployed.\r\n\r\nIt was like looking down a well into some momentarily revealed nether\r\nworld. Some thousands of needy ineffectual men had been raked together\r\nto trail their spiritless misery through the West Eire with an appeal\r\nthat was also in its way a weak and insubstantial threat: “It is Work\r\nwe need, not Charity.”\r\n\r\nThere they were, half-phantom through the fog, a silent, foot-dragging,\r\ninterminable, grey procession. They carried wet, dirty banners, they\r\nrattled boxes for pence; these men who had not said “snap” in the right\r\nplace, the men who had “snapped” too eagerly, the men who had never\r\nsaid “snap,” the men who had never had a chance of saying “snap.” A\r\nshambling, shameful stream they made, oozing along the street, the\r\ngutter waste of competitive civilisation. And we stood high out of it\r\nall, as high as if we looked godlike from another world, standing in a\r\nroom beautifully lit and furnished, skillfully warmed, filled with\r\ncostly things.\r\n\r\n“There,” thought I, “but for the grace of God, go George and Edward\r\nPonderevo.”\r\n\r\nBut my uncle’s thoughts ran in a different channel, and he made that\r\nvision the test of a spirited but inconclusive harangue upon Tariff\r\nReform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\r\nOUR PROGRESS FROM CAMDEN TOWN TO CREST HILL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSo far my history of my aunt and uncle has dealt chiefly with his\r\nindustrial and financial exploits. But side by side with that history\r\nof inflation from the infinitesimal to the immense is another\r\ndevelopment, the change year by year from the shabby impecuniosity of\r\nthe Camden Town lodging to the lavish munificence of the Crest Hill\r\nmarble staircase and my aunt’s golden bed, the bed that was facsimiled\r\nfrom Fontainebleau. And the odd thing is that as I come to this nearer\r\npart of my story I find it much more difficult to tell than the clear\r\nlittle perspective memories of the earlier days. Impressions crowd upon\r\none another and overlap one another; I was presently to fall in love\r\nagain, to be seized by a passion to which I still faintly respond, a\r\npassion that still clouds my mind. I came and went between Ealing and\r\nmy aunt and uncle, and presently between Effie and clubland, and then\r\nbetween business and a life of research that became far more\r\ncontinuous, infinitely more consecutive and memorable than any of these\r\nother sets of experiences. I didn’t witness a regular social progress\r\ntherefore; my aunt and uncle went up in the world, so far as I was\r\nconcerned, as if they were displayed by an early cinematograph, with\r\nlittle jumps and flickers.\r\n\r\nAs I recall this side of our life, the figure of my round-eyes,\r\nbutton-nosed, pink-and-white Aunt Susan tends always to the central\r\nposition. We drove the car and sustained the car, she sat in it with a\r\nmagnificent variety of headgear poised upon her delicate neck, and\r\nalways with that faint ghost of a lisp no misspelling can\r\nrender—commented on and illuminated the new aspects.\r\n\r\nI’ve already sketched the little home behind the Wimblehurst chemist’s\r\nshop, the lodging near the Cobden statue, and the apartments in Gower\r\nStreet. Thence my aunt and uncle went into a flat in Redgauntlet\r\nMansions. There they lived when I married. It was a compact flat, with\r\nvery little for a woman to do in it In those days my aunt, I think,\r\nused to find the time heavy upon her hands, and so she took to books\r\nand reading, and after a time even to going to lectures in the\r\nafternoon. I began to find unexpected books upon her table:\r\nsociological books, travels, Shaw’s plays. “Hullo!” I said, at the\r\nsight of some volume of the latter.\r\n\r\n“I’m keeping a mind, George,” she explained.\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“Keeping a mind. Dogs I never cared for. It’s been a toss-up between\r\nsetting up a mind and setting up a soul. It’s jolly lucky for Him and\r\nyou it’s a mind. I’ve joined the London Library, and I’m going in for\r\nthe Royal Institution and every blessed lecture that comes along next\r\nwinter. You’d better look out.”...\r\n\r\nAnd I remember her coming in late one evening with a note-book in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Where ya been, Susan?” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“Birkbeck—Physiology. I’m getting on.” She sat down and took off her\r\ngloves. “You’re just glass to me,” she sighed, and then in a note of\r\ngrave reproach: “You old _Package!_ I had no idea! The Things you’ve\r\nkept from me!”\r\n\r\nPresently they were setting; up the house at Beckengham, and my aunt\r\nintermitted her intellectual activities. The house at Beckengham was\r\nsomething of an enterprise for them at that time, a reasonably large\r\nplace by the standards of the early years of Tono-Bungay. It was a big,\r\nrather gaunt villa, with a conservatory and a shrubbery, a tennis-lawn,\r\na quite considerable vegetable garden, and a small disused coach-house.\r\nI had some glimpses of the excitements of its inauguration, but not\r\nmany because of the estrangement between my aunt and Marion.\r\n\r\nMy aunt went into that house with considerable zest, and my uncle\r\ndistinguished himself by the thoroughness with which he did the\r\nrepainting and replumbing. He had all the drains up and most of the\r\ngarden with them, and stood administrative on heaps—administrating\r\nwhisky to the workmen. I found him there one day, most Napoleonic, on a\r\nlittle Elba of dirt, in an atmosphere that defies print. He also, I\r\nremember, chose what he considered cheerful contrasts of colours for\r\nthe painting of the woodwork. This exasperated my aunt extremely—she\r\ncalled him a “Pestilential old Splosher” with an unusual note of\r\nearnestness—and he also enraged her into novelties of abuse by giving\r\neach bedroom the name of some favourite hero—Cliff, Napoleon, Cæsar,\r\nand so forth—and having it painted on the door in gilt letters on a\r\nblack label. “Martin Luther” was kept for me. Only her respect for\r\ndomestic discipline, she said, prevented her retaliating with “Old\r\nPondo” on the housemaid’s cupboard.\r\n\r\nAlso he went and ordered one of the completest sets of garden\r\nrequisites I have ever seen—and had them all painted a hard clear blue.\r\nMy aunt got herself large tins of a kindlier hued enamel and had\r\neverything secretly recoated, and this done, she found great joy in the\r\ngarden and became an ardent rose grower and herbaceous borderer,\r\nleaving her Mind, indeed, to damp evenings and the winter months. When\r\nI think of her at Beckenham, I always think first of her as dressed in\r\nthat blue cotton stuff she affected, with her arms in huge gauntleted\r\ngardening gloves, a trowel in one hand and a small but no doubt hardy\r\nand promising annual, limp and very young-looking and sheepish, in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBeckenham, in the persons of a vicar, a doctor’s wife, and a large\r\nproud lady called Hogberry, “called” on my uncle and aunt almost at\r\nonce, so soon in fact as the lawn was down again, and afterwards my\r\naunt made friends with a quiet gentlewoman next door, a propos of an\r\noverhanging cherry tree and the need of repairing the party fence. So\r\nshe resumed her place in society from which she had fallen with the\r\ndisaster of Wimblehurst. She made a partially facetious study of the\r\netiquette of her position, had cards engraved and retaliated calls. And\r\nthen she received a card for one of Mrs. Hogberry’s At Homes, gave an\r\nold garden party herself, participated in a bazaar and sale of work,\r\nand was really becoming quite cheerfully entangled in Beckenham society\r\nwhen she was suddenly taken up by the roots again by my uncle and\r\ntransplanted to Chiselhurst.\r\n\r\n“Old Trek, George,” she said compactly, “Onward and Up,” when I found\r\nher superintending the loading of two big furniture vans. “Go up and\r\nsay good-bye to ‘Martin Luther,’ and then I’ll see what you can do to\r\nhelp me.”\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI look into the jumbled stores of the middle distance of memory, and\r\nBeckenham seems to me a quite transitory phase. But really they were\r\nthere several years; through nearly all my married life, in fact, and\r\nfar longer than the year and odd months we lived together at\r\nWimblehurst. But the Wimblehurst time with them is fuller in my memory\r\nby far then the Beckenham period. There comes back to me with a quite\r\nconsiderable amount of detail the effect of that garden party of my\r\naunt’s and of a little social misbehaviour of which I was guilty on\r\nthat occasion. It’s like a scrap from another life. It’s all set in\r\nwhat is for me a kind of cutaneous feeling, the feeling of rather\r\nill-cut city clothes, frock coat and grey trousers, and of a high\r\ncollar and tie worn in sunshine among flowers. I have still a quite\r\nvivid memory of the little trapezoidal lawn, of the gathering, and\r\nparticularly of the hats and feathers of the gathering, of the\r\nparlour-maid and the blue tea-cups, and of the magnificent presence of\r\nMrs. Hogberry and of her clear, resonant voice. It was a voice that\r\nwould have gone with a garden party on a larger scale; it went into\r\nadjacent premises; it included the gardener who was far up the\r\nvegetable patch and technically out of play. The only other men were my\r\naunt’s doctor, two of the clergy, amiable contrasted men, and Mrs.\r\nHogberry’s imperfectly grown-up son, a youth just bursting into collar.\r\nThe rest were women, except for a young girl or so in a state of\r\nspeechless good behaviour. Marion also was there.\r\n\r\nMarion and I had arrived a little estranged, and I remember her as a\r\nsilent presence, a shadow across all that sunlit emptiness of\r\nintercourse. We had embittered each other with one of those miserable\r\nlittle disputes that seemed so unavoidable between us. She had, with\r\nthe help of Smithie, dressed rather elaborately for the occasion, and\r\nwhen she saw me prepared to accompany her in, I think it was a grey\r\nsuit, she protested that silk hat and frock coat were imperative. I was\r\nrecalcitrant, she quoted an illustrated paper showing a garden party\r\nwith the King present, and finally I capitulated—but after my evil\r\nhabit, resentfully.... Eh, dear! those old quarrels, how pitiful they\r\nwere, how trivial! And how sorrowful they are to recall! I think they\r\ngrow more sorrowful as I grow older, and all the small passionate\r\nreasons for our mutual anger fade and fade out of memory.\r\n\r\nThe impression that Beckenham company has left on my mind is one of a\r\nmodest unreality; they were all maintaining a front of unspecified\r\nsocial pretension, and evading the display of the economic facts of the\r\ncase. Most of the husbands were “in business” off stage, it would have\r\nbeen outrageous to ask what the business was—and the wives were giving\r\ntheir energies to produce, with the assistance of novels and the\r\nillustrated magazines, a moralised version of the afternoon life of the\r\naristocratic class. They hadn’t the intellectual or moral enterprise of\r\nthe upper-class woman, they had no political interests, they had no\r\nviews about anything, and consequently they were, I remember, extremely\r\ndifficult to talk to. They all sat about in the summer-house and in\r\ngarden-chairs, and were very hatty and ruffley and sunshady. Three\r\nladies and the curate played croquet with a general immense gravity,\r\nbroken by occasional loud cries of feigned distress from the curate.\r\n“Oh! Whacking me about again! Augh!”\r\n\r\nThe dominant social fact that afternoon was Mrs. Hogberry; she took up\r\na certain position commanding the croquet and went on, as my aunt said\r\nto me in an incidental aside, “like an old Roundabout.” She talked of\r\nthe way in which Beckenham society was getting mixed, and turned on to\r\na touching letter she had recently received from her former nurse at\r\nLittle Gossdean. Followed a loud account of Little Gossdean and how\r\nmuch she and her eight sisters had been looked up to there. “My poor\r\nmother was quite a little Queen there,” she said. “And such _nice_\r\nCommon people! People say the country labourers are getting\r\ndisrespectful nowadays. It isn’t so—not if they’re properly treated.\r\nHere of course in Beckenham it’s different. I won’t call the people we\r\nget here a Poor—they’re certainly not a proper Poor. They’re Masses. I\r\nalways tell Mr. Bugshoot they’re Masses, and ought to be treated as\r\nsuch.”...\r\n\r\nDim memories of Mrs. Mackridge floated through my mind as I listened to\r\nher....\r\n\r\nI was whirled on this roundabout for a bit, and then had the fortune to\r\nfall off into a _tête-à-tête_ with a lady whom my aunt introduced as\r\nMrs. Mumble—but then she introduced everybody to me as Mumble that\r\nafternoon, either by way of humour or necessity.\r\n\r\nThat must have been one of my earliest essays in the art of polite\r\nconversation, and I remember that I began by criticising the local\r\nrailway service, and that at the third sentence or thereabouts Mrs.\r\nMumble said in a distinctly bright and encouraging way that she feared\r\nI was a very “frivolous” person.\r\n\r\nI wonder now what it was I said that was “frivolous.”\r\n\r\nI don’t know what happened to end that conversation, or if it had an\r\nend. I remember talking to one of the clergy for a time rather\r\nawkwardly, and being given a sort of topographical history of\r\nBeckenham, which he assured me time after time was “Quite an old place.\r\n_Quite_ an old place.” As though I had treated it as new and he meant\r\nto be very patient but very convincing. Then we hung up in a distinct\r\npause, and my aunt rescued me. “George,” she said in a confidential\r\nundertone, “keep the pot a-boiling.” And then audibly, “I say, will you\r\nboth old trot about with tea a bit?”\r\n\r\n“Only too delighted to _trot_ for you, Mrs. Ponderevo,” said the\r\nclergyman, becoming fearfully expert and in his elements; “only too\r\ndelighted.”\r\n\r\nI found we were near a rustic table, and that the housemaid was behind\r\nus in a suitable position to catch us on the rebound with the tea\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“Trot!” repeated the clergyman to me, much amused; “excellent\r\nexpression!” And I just saved him from the tray as he turned about.\r\n\r\nWe handed tea for a while....\r\n\r\n“Give ’em cakes,” said my aunt, flushed, but well in hand. “Helps ’em\r\nto talk, George. Always talk best after a little nourishment. Like\r\nthrowing a bit of turf down an old geyser.”\r\n\r\nShe surveyed the gathering with a predominant blue eye and helped\r\nherself to tea.\r\n\r\n“They keep on going stiff,” she said in an undertone.... “I’ve done my\r\nbest.”\r\n\r\n“It’s been a huge success,” I said encouragingly.\r\n\r\n“That boy has had his legs crossed in that position and hasn’t spoken\r\nfor ten minutes. Stiffer and stiffer. Brittle. He’s beginning a dry\r\ncough—always a bad sign, George.... Walk ’em about, shall I?—rub their\r\nnoses with snow?”\r\n\r\nHappily she didn’t. I got myself involved with the gentlewoman from\r\nnext door, a pensive, languid-looking little woman with a low voice,\r\nand fell talking; our topic, Cats and Dogs, and which it was we liked\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n“I always feel,” said the pensive little woman, “that there’s something\r\nabout a dog—A cat hasn’t got it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I found myself admitting with great enthusiasm, “there is\r\nsomething. And yet again—”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I know there’s something about a cat, too. But it isn’t the same.”\r\n\r\n“Not quite the same,” I admitted; “but still it’s something.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! But such a different something!”\r\n\r\n“More sinuous.”\r\n\r\n“Much more.”\r\n\r\n“Ever so much more.”\r\n\r\n“It makes all the difference, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “_all_.”\r\n\r\nShe glanced at me gravely and sighed a long, deeply felt “_Yes_.”\r\n\r\nA long pause.\r\n\r\nThe thing seemed to me to amount to a stale-mate. Fear came into my\r\nheart and much perplexity.\r\n\r\n“The—er—Roses,” I said. I felt like a drowning man. “Those roses—don’t\r\nyou think they are—very beautiful flowers?”\r\n\r\n“Aren’t they!” she agreed gently. “There seems to be something in\r\nroses—something—I don’t know how to express it.”\r\n\r\n“Something,” I said helpfully.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, “something. Isn’t there?”\r\n\r\n“So few people see it,” I said; “more’s the pity!”\r\n\r\nShe sighed and said again very softly, “_Yes_.”...\r\n\r\nThere was another long pause. I looked at her and she was thinking\r\ndreamily. The drowning sensation returned, the fear and enfeeblement. I\r\nperceived by a sort of inspiration that her tea-cup was empty.\r\n\r\n“Let me take your cup,” I said abruptly, and, that secured, made for\r\nthe table by the summer-house. I had no intention then of deserting my\r\naunt. But close at hand the big French window of the drawing-room\r\nyawned inviting and suggestive. I can feel all that temptation now, and\r\nparticularly the provocation of my collar. In an instant I was lost. I\r\nwould—Just for a moment!\r\n\r\nI dashed in, put down the cup on the keys of the grand piano and fled\r\nupstairs, softly, swiftly, three steps at a time, to the sanctuary of\r\nmy uncle’s study, his snuggery. I arrived there breathless, convinced\r\nthere was no return for me. I was very glad and ashamed of myself, and\r\ndesperate. By means of a penknife I contrived to break open his cabinet\r\nof cigars, drew a chair to the window, took off my coat, collar and\r\ntie, and remained smoking guiltily and rebelliously, and peeping\r\nthrough the blind at the assembly on the lawn until it was altogether\r\ngone....\r\n\r\nThe clergymen, I thought, were wonderful.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nA few such pictures of those early days at Beckenham stand out, and\r\nthen I find myself among the Chiselhurst memories. The Chiselhurst\r\nmansion had “grounds” rather than a mere garden, and there was a\r\ngardener’s cottage and a little lodge at the gate. The ascendant\r\nmovement was always far more in evidence there than at Beckenham. The\r\nvelocity was increasing.\r\n\r\nOne night picks itself out as typical, as, in its way, marking an\r\nepoch. I was there, I think, about some advertisement stuff, on some\r\nsort of business anyhow, and my uncle and aunt had come back in a fly\r\nfrom a dinner at the Runcorns. (Even there he was nibbling at Runcorn\r\nwith the idea of our great Amalgamation budding in his mind.) I got\r\ndown there, I suppose, about eleven. I found the two of them sitting in\r\nthe study, my aunt on a chair-arm with a whimsical pensiveness on her\r\nface, regarding my uncle, and he, much extended and very rotund, in the\r\nlow arm-chair drawn up to the fender.\r\n\r\n“Look here, George,” said my uncle, after my first greetings. “I just\r\nbeen saying: We aren’t Oh Fay!”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“Not Oh Fay! Socially!”\r\n\r\n“Old _Fly_, he means, George—French!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Didn’t think of French. One never knows where to have him. What’s\r\ngone wrong to-night?”\r\n\r\n“I been thinking. It isn’t any particular thing. I ate too much of that\r\nfishy stuff at first, like salt frog spawn, and was a bit confused by\r\nolives; and—well, I didn’t know which wine was which. Had to say _that_\r\neach time. It puts your talk all wrong. And she wasn’t in evening\r\ndress, not like the others. We can’t go on in that style, George—not a\r\nproper ad.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure you were right,” I said, “in having a fly.”\r\n\r\n“We got to do it all better,” said my uncle, “we got to do it in Style.\r\nSmart business, smart men. She tries to pass it off as humorous”—my\r\naunt pulled a grimace—“it isn’t humorous! See! We’re on the up-grade\r\nnow, fair and square. We’re going to be big. We aren’t going to be\r\nlaughed at as Poovenoos, see!”\r\n\r\n“Nobody laughed at you,” said my aunt. “Old Bladder!”\r\n\r\n“Nobody isn’t going to laugh at me,” said my uncle, glancing at his\r\ncontours and suddenly sitting up.\r\n\r\nMy aunt raised her eyebrows slightly, swung her foot, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n“We aren’t keeping pace with our own progress, George. We got to. We’re\r\nbumping against new people, and they set up to be gentlefolks—etiquette\r\ndinners and all the rest of it. They give themselves airs and expect us\r\nto be fish-out-of-water. We aren’t going to be. They think we’ve no\r\nStyle. Well, we give them Style for our advertisements, and we’re going\r\nto give ’em Style all through.... You needn’t be born to it to dance\r\nwell on the wires of the Bond Street tradesmen. See?”\r\n\r\nI handed him the cigar-box.\r\n\r\n“Runcorn hadn’t cigars like these,” he said, truncating one lovingly.\r\n“We beat him at cigars. We’ll beat him all round.”\r\n\r\nMy aunt and I regarded him, full of apprehensions.\r\n\r\n“I got idees,” he said darkly to the cigar, deepening our dread.\r\n\r\nHe pocketed his cigar-cutter and spoke again.\r\n\r\n“We got to learn all the rotten little game first. See, F’rinstance, we\r\ngot to get samples of all the blessed wines there are—and learn ’em up.\r\nStern, Smoor, Burgundy, all of ’em! She took Stern to-night—and when\r\nshe tasted it first—you pulled a face, Susan, you did. I saw you. It\r\nsurprised you. You bunched your nose. We got to get used to wine and\r\nnot do that. We got to get used to wearing evening dress—_you_, Susan,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Always have had a tendency to stick out of my clothes,” said my aunt.\r\n“However—Who cares?” She shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\nI had never seen my uncle so immensely serious.\r\n\r\n“Got to get the hang of etiquette,” he went on to the fire. “Horses\r\neven. Practise everything. Dine every night in evening dress.... Get a\r\nbrougham or something. Learn up golf and tennis and things. Country\r\ngentleman. Oh Fay. It isn’t only freedom from Goochery.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Oh!—Gawshery, if you like!”\r\n\r\n“French, George,” said my aunt. “But _I’m_ not ol’ Gooch. I made that\r\nface for fun.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t only freedom from Gawshery. We got to have Style. See! Style!\r\nJust all right and one better. That’s what I call Style. We can do it,\r\nand we will.”\r\n\r\nHe mumbled his cigar and smoked for a space, leaning forward and\r\nlooking into the fire.\r\n\r\n“What is it,” he asked, “after all? What is it? Tips about eating; tips\r\nabout drinking. Clothes. How to hold yourself, and not say jes’ the few\r\nlittle things they know for certain are wrong—jes’ the shibboleth\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nHe was silent again, and the cigar crept up from the horizontal towards\r\nthe zenith as the confidence of his mouth increased.\r\n\r\n“Learn the whole bag of tricks in six months.” he said, becoming more\r\ncheerful. “Ah, Susan? Beat it out! George, you in particular ought to\r\nget hold of it. Ought to get into a good club, and all that.”\r\n\r\n“Always ready to learn!” I said. “Ever since you gave me the chance of\r\nLatin. So far we don’t seem to have hit upon any Latin-speaking stratum\r\nin the population.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve come to French,” said my aunt, “anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a very useful language,” said my uncle. “Put a point on things.\r\nZzzz. As for accent, no Englishman has an accent. No Englishman\r\npronounces French properly. Don’t you tell _me_. It’s a Bluff.—It’s all\r\na Bluff. Life’s a Bluff—practically. That’s why it’s so important,\r\nSusan, for us to attend to Style. Le Steel Say Lum. The Style it’s the\r\nman. Whad you laughing at, Susan? George, you’re not smoking. These\r\ncigars are good for the mind.... What do _you_ think of it all? We got\r\nto adapt ourselves. We have—so far.... Not going to be beat by these\r\nsilly things.”\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it, George?” he insisted.\r\n\r\nWhat I said I thought of it I don’t now recall. Only I have very\r\ndistinctly the impression of meeting for a moment my aunt’s\r\nimpenetrable eye. And anyhow he started in with his accustomed energy\r\nto rape the mysteries of the Costly Life, and become the calmest of its\r\nlords. On the whole, I think he did it—thoroughly. I have crowded\r\nmemories, a little difficult to disentangle, of his experimental\r\nstages, his experimental proceedings. It’s hard at times to say which\r\nmemory comes in front of which. I recall him as presenting on the whole\r\na series of small surprises, as being again and again, unexpectedly, a\r\nlittle more self-confident, a little more polished, a little richer and\r\nfiner, a little more aware of the positions and values of things and\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThere was a time—it must have been very early—when I saw him deeply\r\nimpressed by the splendours of the dining-room of the National Liberal\r\nClub. Heaven knows who our host was or what that particular little\r\n“feed” was about now!—all that sticks is the impression of our\r\nstraggling entry, a string of six or seven guests, and my uncle looking\r\nabout him at the numerous bright red-shaded tables, at the exotics in\r\ngreat Majolica jars, at the shining ceramic columns and pilasters, at\r\nthe impressive portraits of Liberal statesmen and heroes, and all that\r\ncontributes to the ensemble of that palatial spectacle. He was betrayed\r\ninto a whisper to me, “This is all Right, George!” he said. That\r\nartless comment seems almost incredible as I set it down; there came a\r\ntime so speedily when not even the clubs of New York could have\r\noverawed my uncle, and when he could walk through the bowing\r\nmagnificence of the Royal Grand Hotel to his chosen table in that\r\naggressively exquisite gallery upon the river, with all the easy calm\r\nof one of earth’s legitimate kings.\r\n\r\nThe two of them learnt the new game rapidly and well; they experimented\r\nabroad, they experimented at home. At Chiselhurst, with the aid of a\r\nnew, very costly, but highly instructive cook, they tried over\r\neverything they heard of that roused their curiosity and had any\r\nreputation for difficulty, from asparagus to plover’s eggs. They\r\nafterwards got a gardener who could wait at table—and he brought the\r\nsoil home to one. Then there came a butler.\r\n\r\nI remember my aunt’s first dinner-gown very brightly, and how she stood\r\nbefore the fire in the drawing-room confessing once unsuspected pretty\r\narms with all the courage she possessed, and looking over her shoulder\r\nat herself in a mirror.\r\n\r\n“A ham,” she remarked reflectively, “must feel like this. Just a\r\nnecklace.”...\r\n\r\nI attempted, I think, some commonplace compliment.\r\n\r\nMy uncle appeared at the door in a white waistcoat and with his hands\r\nin his trouser pockets; he halted and surveyed her critically.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t tell you from a duchess, Susan,” he remarked. “I’d like to\r\nhave you painted, standin’ at the fire like that. Sargent! You\r\nlook—spirited, somehow. Lord!—I wish some of those damned tradesmen at\r\nWimblehurst could see you.”...\r\n\r\nThey did a lot of week-ending at hotels, and sometimes I went down with\r\nthem. We seemed to fall into a vast drifting crowd of social learners.\r\nI don’t know whether it is due simply to my changed circumstances, but\r\nit seems to me there have been immensely disproportionate developments\r\nof the hotel-frequenting and restaurant-using population during the\r\nlast twenty years. It is not only, I think, that there are crowds of\r\npeople who, like we were, are in the economically ascendant phase, but\r\nwhole masses of the prosperous section of the population must be\r\naltering its habits, giving up high-tea for dinner and taking to\r\nevening dress, using the week-end hotels as a practise-ground for these\r\nnew social arts. A swift and systematic conversion to gentility has\r\nbeen going on, I am convinced, throughout the whole commercial\r\nupper-middle class since I was twenty-one. Curiously mixed was the\r\npersonal quality of the people one saw in these raids. There were\r\nconscientiously refined and low-voiced people reeking with proud\r\nbashfulness; there were aggressively smart people using pet diminutives\r\nfor each other loudly and seeking fresh occasions for brilliant\r\nrudeness; there were awkward husbands and wives quarrelling furtively\r\nabout their manners and ill at ease under the eye of the winter;\r\ncheerfully amiable and often discrepant couples with a disposition to\r\ninconspicuous corners, and the jolly sort, affecting an unaffected\r\nease; plump happy ladies who laughed too loud, and gentlemen in evening\r\ndress who subsequently “got their pipes.” And nobody, you knew, was\r\nanybody, however expensively they dressed and whatever rooms they took.\r\n\r\nI look back now with a curious remoteness of spirit to those crowded\r\ndining-rooms with their dispersed tables and their inevitable\r\nred-shaded lights and the unsympathetic, unskillful waiters, and the\r\nchoice of “Thig or Glear, Sir?” I’ve not dined in that way, in that\r\nsort of place, now for five years—it must be quite five years, so\r\nspecialised and narrow is my life becoming.\r\n\r\nMy uncle’s earlier motor-car phases work in with these associations,\r\nand there stands out a little bright vignette of the hall of the\r\nMagnificent, Bexhill-on-Sea, and people dressed for dinner and sitting\r\nabout amidst the scarlet furniture—satin and white-enameled woodwork\r\nuntil the gong should gather them; and my aunt is there, very\r\nmarvelously wrapped about in a dust cloak and a cage-like veil, and\r\nthere are hotel porters and under-porters very alert, and an obsequious\r\nmanager; and the tall young lady in black from the office is surprised\r\ninto admiration, and in the middle of the picture is my uncle, making\r\nhis first appearance in that Esquimaux costume I have already\r\nmentioned, a short figure, compactly immense, hugely goggled, wearing a\r\nsort of brown rubber proboscis, and surmounted by a table-land of\r\nmotoring cap.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSo it was we recognised our new needs as fresh invaders of the upper\r\nlevels of the social system, and set ourselves quite consciously to the\r\nacquisition of Style and _Savoir Faire_. We became part of what is\r\nnowadays quite an important element in the confusion of our world, that\r\nmultitude of economically ascendant people who are learning how to\r\nspend money. It is made up of financial people, the owners of the\r\nbusinesses that are eating up their competitors, inventors of new\r\nsources of wealth, such as ourselves; it includes nearly all America as\r\none sees it on the European stage. It is a various multitude having\r\nonly this in common: they are all moving, and particularly their\r\nwomankind are moving, from conditions in which means were insistently\r\nfinite, things were few, and customs simple, towards a limitless\r\nexpenditure and the sphere of attraction of Bond Street, Fifth Avenue,\r\nand Paris. Their general effect is one of progressive revolution, of\r\nlimitless rope.\r\n\r\nThey discover suddenly indulgences their moral code never foresaw and\r\nhas no provision for, elaborations, ornaments, possessions beyond their\r\nwildest dreams. With an immense astonished zest they begin _shopping_,\r\nbegin a systematic adaptation to a new life crowded and brilliant with\r\nthings shopped, with jewels, maids, butlers, coachmen, electric\r\nbroughams, hired town and country houses. They plunge into it as one\r\nplunges into a career; as a class, they talk, think, and dream\r\npossessions. Their literature, their Press, turns all on that; immense\r\nillustrated weeklies of unsurpassed magnificence guide them in domestic\r\narchitecture, in the art of owning a garden, in the achievement of the\r\nsumptuous in motor-cars, in an elaborate sporting equipment, in the\r\npurchase and control of their estates, in travel and stupendous hotels.\r\nOnce they begin to move they go far and fast. Acquisition becomes the\r\nsubstance of their lives. They find a world organised to gratify that\r\npassion. In a brief year or so they are connoisseurs. They join in the\r\nplunder of the eighteenth century, buy rare old books, fine old\r\npictures, good old furniture. Their first crude conception of dazzling\r\nsuites of the newly perfect is replaced almost from the outset by a\r\njackdaw dream of accumulating costly discrepant old things.\r\n\r\nI seem to remember my uncle taking to shopping quite suddenly. In the\r\nBeckenham days and in the early Chiselhurst days he was chiefly\r\ninterested in getting money, and except for his onslaught on the\r\nBeckenham house, bothered very little about his personal surroundings\r\nand possessions. I forget now when the change came and he began to\r\nspend. Some accident must have revealed to him this new source of\r\npower, or some subtle shifting occurred in the tissues of his brain. He\r\nbegan to spend and “shop.” So soon as he began to shop, he began to\r\nshop violently. He began buying pictures, and then, oddly enough, old\r\nclocks. For the Chiselhurst house he bought nearly a dozen grandfather\r\nclocks and three copper warming pans. After that he bought much\r\nfurniture. Then he plunged into art patronage, and began to commission\r\npictures and to make presents to churches and institutions. His buying\r\nincreased with a regular acceleration. Its development was a part of\r\nthe mental changes that came to him in the wild excitements of the last\r\nfour years of his ascent. Towards the climax he was a furious spender;\r\nhe shopped with large unexpected purchases, he shopped like a mind\r\nseeking expression, he shopped to astonish and dismay; shopped\r\n_crescendo_, shopped _fortissimo, con molto espressione_ until the\r\nmagnificent smash of Crest Hill eroded his shopping for ever. Always it\r\nwas he who shopped. My aunt did not shine as a purchaser. It is a\r\ncurious thing, due to I know not what fine strain in her composition,\r\nthat my aunt never set any great store upon possessions. She plunged\r\nthrough that crowded bazaar of Vanity Fair during those feverish years,\r\nspending no doubt freely and largely, but spending with detachment and\r\na touch of humorous contempt for the things, even the “old” things,\r\nthat money can buy. It came to me suddenly one afternoon just how\r\ndetached she was, as I saw her going towards the Hardingham, sitting\r\nup, as she always did, rather stiffly in her electric brougham,\r\nregarding the glittering world with interested and ironically innocent\r\nblue eyes from under the brim of a hat that defied comment. “No one,” I\r\nthought, “would sit so apart if she hadn’t dreams—and what are her\r\ndreams?”\r\n\r\nI’d never thought.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember, too, an outburst of scornful description after she had\r\nlunched with a party of women at the Imperial Cosmic Club. She came\r\nround to my rooms on the chance of finding me there, and I gave her\r\ntea. She professed herself tired and cross, and flung herself into my\r\nchair....\r\n\r\n“George,” she cried, “the Things women are! Do _I_ stink of money?”\r\n\r\n“Lunching?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n“Plutocratic ladies?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oriental type?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Like a burst hareem!... Bragging of possessions.... They feel you.\r\nThey feel your clothes, George, to see if they are good!”\r\n\r\nI soothed her as well as I could. “They _are_ Good aren’t they?” I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“It’s the old pawnshop in their blood,” she said, drinking tea; and\r\nthen in infinite disgust, “They run their hands over your clothes—they\r\npaw you.”\r\n\r\nI had a moment of doubt whether perhaps she had not been discovered in\r\npossession of unsuspected forgeries. I don’t know. After that my eyes\r\nwere quickened, and I began to see for myself women running their hands\r\nover other women’s furs, scrutinising their lace, even demanding to\r\nhandle jewelry, appraising, envying, testing. They have a kind of\r\netiquette. The woman who feels says, “What beautiful sables?” “What\r\nlovely lace?” The woman felt admits proudly: “It’s Real, you know,” or\r\ndisavows pretension modestly and hastily, “It’s Rot Good.” In each\r\nother’s houses they peer at the pictures, handle the selvage of\r\nhangings, look at the bottoms of china....\r\n\r\nI wonder if it IS the old pawnshop in the blood.\r\n\r\nI doubt if Lady Drew and the Olympians did that sort of thing, but here\r\nI may be only clinging to another of my former illusions about\r\naristocracy and the State. Perhaps always possessions have been Booty,\r\nand never anywhere has there been such a thing as house and furnishings\r\nnative and natural to the women and men who made use of them....\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nFor me, at least, it marked an epoch in my uncle’s career when I learnt\r\none day that he had “shopped” Lady Grove. I realised a fresh, wide,\r\nunpreluded step. He took me by surprise with the sudden change of scale\r\nfrom such portable possessions as jewels and motor-cars to a stretch of\r\ncountryside. The transaction was Napoleonic; he was told of the place;\r\nhe said “snap”; there were no preliminary desirings or searchings. Then\r\nhe came home and said what he had done. Even my aunt was for a day or\r\nso measurably awestricken by this exploit in purchase, and we both went\r\ndown with him to see the house in a mood near consternation. It struck\r\nus then as a very lordly place indeed. I remember the three of us\r\nstanding on the terrace that looked westward, surveying the\r\nsky-reflecting windows of the house, and a feeling of unwarrantable\r\nintrusion comes back to me.\r\n\r\nLady Grove, you know, is a very beautiful house indeed, a still and\r\ngracious place, whose age-long seclusion was only effectively broken\r\nwith the toot of the coming of the motor-car. An old Catholic family\r\nhad died out in it, century by century, and was now altogether dead.\r\nPortions of the fabric are thirteenth century, and its last\r\narchitectural revision was Tudor; within, it is for the most part dark\r\nand chilly, save for two or three favoured rooms and its tall-windowed,\r\noak-galleried hall. Its terrace is its noblest feature; a very wide,\r\nbroad lawn it is, bordered by a low stone battlement, and there is a\r\ngreat cedar in one corner under whose level branches one looks out\r\nacross the blue distances of the Weald, blue distances that are made\r\nextraordinarily Italian in quality by virtue of the dark masses of that\r\nsingle tree. It is a very high terrace; southward one looks down upon\r\nthe tops of wayfaring trees and spruces, and westward on a steep slope\r\nof beechwood, through which the road comes. One turns back to the still\r\nold house, and sees a grey and lichenous façade with a very finely\r\narched entrance. It was warmed by the afternoon light and touched with\r\nthe colour of a few neglected roses and a pyracanthus. It seemed to me\r\nthat the most modern owner conceivable in this serene fine place was\r\nsome bearded scholarly man in a black cassock, gentle-voiced and\r\nwhite-handed, or some very soft-robed, grey gentlewoman. And there was\r\nmy uncle holding his goggles in a sealskin glove, wiping the glass with\r\na pocket-handkerchief, and asking my aunt if Lady Grove wasn’t a “Bit\r\nof all Right.”\r\n\r\nMy aunt made him no answer.\r\n\r\n“The man who built this,” I speculated, “wore armour and carried a\r\nsword.”\r\n\r\n“There’s some of it inside still,” said my uncle.\r\n\r\nWe went inside. An old woman with very white hair was in charge of the\r\nplace and cringed rather obviously to the new master. She evidently\r\nfound him a very strange and frightful apparition indeed, and was\r\ndreadfully afraid of him. But if the surviving present bowed down to\r\nus, the past did not. We stood up to the dark, long portraits of the\r\nextinguished race—one was a Holbein—and looked them in their sidelong\r\neyes. They looked back at us. We all, I know, felt the enigmatical\r\nquality in them. Even my uncle was momentarily embarrassed, I think, by\r\nthat invincibly self-complacent expression. It was just as though,\r\nafter all, he had _not_ bought them up and replaced them altogether; as\r\nthough that, secretly, they knew better and could smile at him.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the place was akin to Bladesover, but touched with\r\nsomething older and remoter. That armour that stood about had once\r\nserved in tilt-yards, if indeed it had not served in battle, and this\r\nfamily had sent its blood and treasure, time after time, upon the most\r\nromantic quest in history, to Palestine. Dreams, loyalties, place and\r\nhonour, how utterly had it all evaporated, leaving, at last, the final\r\nexpression of its spirit, these quaint painted smiles, these smiles of\r\ntriumphant completion! It had evaporated, indeed, long before the\r\nultimate Durgan had died, and in his old age he had cumbered the place\r\nwith Early Victorian cushions and carpets and tapestry table-cloths and\r\ninvalid appliances of a type even more extinct, it seemed to us, than\r\nthe crusades.... Yes, it was different from Bladesover.\r\n\r\n“Bit stuffy, George,” said my uncle. “They hadn’t much idea of\r\nventilation when this was built.”\r\n\r\nOne of the panelled rooms was half-filled with presses and a\r\nfour-poster bed. “Might be the ghost room,” said my uncle; but it did\r\nnot seem to me that so retiring a family as the Durgans, so old and\r\ncompletely exhausted a family as the Durgans, was likely to haunt\r\nanybody. What living thing now had any concern with their honour and\r\njudgments and good and evil deeds? Ghosts and witchcraft were a later\r\ninnovation—that fashion came from Scotland with the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, prying for epitaphs, we found a marble crusader with a\r\nbroken nose, under a battered canopy of fretted stone, outside the\r\nrestricted limits of the present Duffield church, and half buried in\r\nnettles. “Ichabod,” said my uncle. “Eh? We shall be like that, Susan,\r\nsome day.... I’m going to clean him up a bit and put a railing to keep\r\noff the children.”\r\n\r\n“Old saved at the eleventh hour,” said my aunt, quoting one of the less\r\nsuccessful advertisements of Tono-Bungay.\r\n\r\nBut I don’t think my uncle heard her.\r\n\r\nIt was by our captured crusader that the vicar found us. He came round\r\nthe corner at us briskly, a little out of breath. He had an air of\r\nhaving been running after us since the first toot of our horn had\r\nwarned the village of our presence. He was an Oxford man, clean-shaven,\r\nwith a cadaverous complexion and a guardedly respectful manner, a\r\ncultivated intonation, and a general air of accommodation to the new\r\norder of things. These Oxford men are the Greeks of our plutocratic\r\nempire. He was a Tory in spirit, and what one may call an adapted Tory\r\nby stress of circumstances; that is to say, he was no longer a\r\nlegitimist; he was prepared for the substitution of new lords for old.\r\nWe were pill vendors he knew, and no doubt horribly vulgar in soul; but\r\nthen it might have been some polygamous Indian rajah, a great strain on\r\na good man’s tact, or some Jew with an inherited expression of\r\ncontempt. Anyhow, we were English, and neither Dissenters nor\r\nSocialists, and he was cheerfully prepared to do what he could to make\r\ngentlemen of both of us. He might have preferred Americans for some\r\nreasons; they are not so obviously taken from one part of the social\r\nsystem and dumped down in another, and they are more teachable; but in\r\nthis world we cannot always be choosers. So he was very bright and\r\npleasant with us, showed us the church, gossiped informingly about our\r\nneighbours on the countryside—Tux, the banker; Lord Boom, the magazine\r\nand newspaper proprietor; Lord Carnaby, that great sportsman, and old\r\nLady Osprey. And finally he took us by way of a village lane—three\r\nchildren bobbed convulsively with eyes of terror for my uncle—through a\r\nmeticulous garden to a big, slovenly Vicarage with faded Victorian\r\nfurniture and a faded Victorian wife, who gave us tea and introduced us\r\nto a confusing family dispersed among a lot of disintegrating basket\r\nchairs upon the edge of a well-used tennis lawn.\r\n\r\nThese people interested me. They were a common type, no doubt, but they\r\nwere new to me. There were two lank sons who had been playing singles\r\nat tennis, red-eared youths growing black moustaches, and dressed in\r\nconscientiously untidy tweeds and unbuttoned and ungirt Norfolk\r\njackets. There were a number of ill-nourished-looking daughters,\r\nsensible and economical in their costume, the younger still with long,\r\nbrown-stockinged legs, and the eldest present—there were, we\r\ndiscovered, one or two hidden away—displaying a large gold cross and\r\nother aggressive ecclesiastical symbols; there were two or three\r\nfox-terriers, a retrieverish mongrel, and an old, bloody-eyed and very\r\nevil-smelling St. Bernard. There was a jackdaw. There was, moreover, an\r\nambiguous, silent lady that my aunt subsequently decided must be a very\r\ndeaf paying guest. Two or three other people had concealed themselves\r\nat our coming and left unfinished teas behind them. Rugs and cushions\r\nlay among the chairs, and two of the latter were, I noted, covered with\r\nUnion Jacks.\r\n\r\nThe vicar introduced us sketchily, and the faded Victorian wife\r\nregarded my aunt with a mixture of conventional scorn and abject\r\nrespect, and talked to her in a languid, persistent voice about people\r\nin the neighbourhood whom my aunt could not possibly know.\r\n\r\nMy aunt received these personalia cheerfully, with her blue eyes\r\nflitting from point to point, and coming back again and again to the\r\npinched faces of the daughters and the cross upon the eldest’s breast.\r\nEncouraged by my aunt’s manner, the vicar’s wife grew patronising and\r\nkindly, and made it evident that she could do much to bridge the social\r\ngulf between ourselves and the people of family about us.\r\n\r\nI had just snatches of that conversation. “Mrs. Merridew brought him\r\nquite a lot of money. Her father, I believe, had been in the Spanish\r\nwine trade—quite a lady though. And after that he fell off his horse\r\nand cracked his brain pan and took to fishing and farming. I’m sure\r\nyou’ll like to know them. He’s _most_ amusing.... The daughter had a\r\ndisappointment and went to China as a missionary and got mixed up in a\r\nmassacre.”...\r\n\r\n“The most beautiful silks and things she brought back, you’d hardly\r\nbelieve!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they gave them to propitiate her. You see, they didn’t understand\r\nthe difference, and they thought that as they’d been massacring people,\r\n_they’d_ be massacred. They didn’t understand the difference\r\nChristianity makes.”...\r\n\r\n“Seven bishops they’ve had in the family!”\r\n\r\n“Married a Papist and was quite lost to them.”...\r\n\r\n“He failed some dreadful examination and had to go into the\r\nmilitia.”...\r\n\r\n“So she bit his leg as hard as ever she could and he let go.”...\r\n\r\n“Had four of his ribs amputated.”...\r\n\r\n“Caught meningitis and was carried off in a week.”\r\n\r\n“Had to have a large piece of silver tube let into his throat, and if\r\nhe wants to talk he puts his finger on it. It makes him so interesting,\r\nI think. You feel he’s sincere somehow. A most charming man in every\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“Preserved them both in spirits very luckily, and there they are in his\r\nstudy, though of course he doesn’t show them to everybody.”\r\n\r\nThe silent lady, unperturbed by these apparently exciting topics,\r\nscrutinised my aunt’s costume with a singular intensity, and was\r\nvisibly moved when she unbuttoned her dust cloak and flung it wide.\r\nMeanwhile we men conversed, one of the more spirited daughters listened\r\nbrightly, and the youths lay on the grass at our feet. My uncle offered\r\nthem cigars, but they both declined,—out of bashfulness, it seemed to\r\nme, whereas the vicar, I think, accepted out of tact. When we were not\r\nlooking at them directly, these young men would kick each other\r\nfurtively.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of my uncle’s cigar, the vicar’s mind had soared\r\nbeyond the limits of the district. “This Socialism,” he said, “seems\r\nmaking great headway.”\r\n\r\nMy uncle shook his head. “We’re too individualistic in this country for\r\nthat sort of nonsense,” he said “Everybody’s business is nobody’s\r\nbusiness. That’s where they go wrong.”\r\n\r\n“They have some intelligent people in their ranks, I am told,” said the\r\nvicar, “writers and so forth. Quite a distinguished playwright, my\r\neldest daughter was telling me—I forget his name.\r\n\r\n“Milly, dear! Oh! she’s not here. Painters, too, they have. This\r\nSocialist, it seems to me, is part of the Unrest of the Age.... But, as\r\nyou say, the spirit of the people is against it. In the country, at any\r\nrate. The people down here are too sturdily independent in their small\r\nway—and too sensible altogether.”...\r\n\r\n“It’s a great thing for Duffield to have Lady Grove occupied again,” he\r\nwas saying when my wandering attention came back from some attractive\r\ncasualty in his wife’s discourse. “People have always looked up to the\r\nhouse and considering all things, old Mr. Durgan really was\r\nextraordinarily good—extraordinarily good. You intend to give us a good\r\ndeal of your time here, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“I mean to do my duty by the Parish,” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“I’m sincerely glad to hear it—sincerely. We’ve missed—the house\r\ninfluence. An English village isn’t complete—People get out of hand.\r\nLife grows dull. The young people drift away to London.”\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed his cigar gingerly for a moment.\r\n\r\n“We shall look to you to liven things up,” he said, poor man!\r\n\r\nMy uncle cocked his cigar and removed it from his mouth.\r\n\r\n“What you think the place wants?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for an answer. “I been thinking while you been\r\ntalking—things one might do. Cricket—a good English game—sports. Build\r\nthe chaps a pavilion perhaps. Then every village ought to have a\r\nminiature rifle range.”\r\n\r\n“Ye-ees,” said the vicar. “Provided, of course, there isn’t a constant\r\npopping.”...\r\n\r\n“Manage _that_ all right,” said my uncle. “Thing’d be a sort of long\r\nshed. Paint it red. British colour. Then there’s a Union Jack for the\r\nchurch and the village school. Paint the school red, too, p’raps. Not\r\nenough colour about now. Too grey. Then a maypole.”\r\n\r\n“How far our people would take up that sort of thing—” began the vicar.\r\n\r\n“I’m all for getting that good old English spirit back again,” said my\r\nuncle. “Merrymakings. Lads and lasses dancing on the village green.\r\nHarvest home. Fairings. Yule Log—all the rest of it.”\r\n\r\n“How would old Sally Glue do for a May Queen?” asked one of the sons in\r\nthe slight pause that followed.\r\n\r\n“Or Annie Glassbound?” said the other, with the huge virile guffaw of a\r\nyoung man whose voice has only recently broken.\r\n\r\n“Sally Glue is eighty-five,” explained the vicar, “and Annie Glassbound\r\nis well—a young lady of extremely generous proportions. And not quite\r\nright, you know. Not quite right—here.” He tapped his brow.\r\n\r\n“Generous proportions!” said the eldest son, and the guffaws were\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said the vicar, “all the brisker girls go into service in or\r\nnear London. The life of excitement attracts them. And no doubt the\r\nhigher wages have something to do with it. And the liberty to wear\r\nfinery. And generally—freedom from restraint. So that there might be a\r\nlittle difficulty perhaps to find a May Queen here just at present who\r\nwas really young and er—pretty.... Of course I couldn’t think of any of\r\nmy girls—or anything of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“We got to attract ’em back,” said my uncle. “That’s what I feel about\r\nit. We got to Buck-Up the country. The English country is a going\r\nconcern still; just as the Established Church—if you’ll excuse me\r\nsaying it, is a going concern. Just as Oxford is—or Cambridge. Or any\r\nof those old, fine old things. Only it wants fresh capital, fresh idees\r\nand fresh methods. Light railways, f’rinstance—scientific use of\r\ndrainage. Wire fencing machinery—all that.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar’s face for one moment betrayed dismay. Perhaps he was\r\nthinking of his country walks amids the hawthorns and honeysuckle.\r\n\r\n“There’s great things,” said my uncle, “to be done on Mod’un lines with\r\nVillage Jam and Pickles—boiled in the country.”\r\n\r\nIt was the reverberation of this last sentence in my mind, I think,\r\nthat sharpened my sentimental sympathy as we went through the\r\nstraggling village street and across the trim green on our way back to\r\nLondon. It seemed that afternoon the most tranquil and idyllic\r\ncollection of creeper-sheltered homes you can imagine; thatch still\r\nlingered on a whitewashed cottage or two, pyracanthus, wall-flowers,\r\nand daffodils abounded, and an unsystematic orchard or so was white\r\nwith blossom above and gay with bulbs below. I noted a row of straw\r\nbeehives, beehive-shaped, beehives of the type long since condemned as\r\ninefficient by all progressive minds, and in the doctor’s acre of grass\r\na flock of two whole sheep was grazing,—no doubt he’d taken them on\r\naccount. Two men and one old woman made gestures of abject vassalage,\r\nand my uncle replied with a lordly gesture of his great motoring\r\nglove....\r\n\r\n“England’s full of Bits like this,” said my uncle, leaning over the\r\nfront seat and looking back with great satisfaction. The black glare of\r\nhis goggles rested for a time on the receding turrets of Lady Grove\r\njust peeping over the trees.\r\n\r\n“I shall have a flagstaff, I think,” he considered. “Then one could\r\nshow when one is in residence. The villagers will like to know.”...\r\n\r\nI reflected. “They will” I said. “They’re used to liking to know.”...\r\n\r\nMy aunt had been unusually silent. Suddenly she spoke. “He says Snap,”\r\nshe remarked; “he buys that place. And a nice old job of Housekeeping\r\nhe gives me! He sails through the village swelling like an old turkey.\r\nAnd who’ll have to scoot the butler? Me! Who’s got to forget all she\r\never knew and start again? Me! Who’s got to trek from Chiselhurst and\r\nbe a great lady? Me! ... You old Bother! Just when I was settling down\r\nand beginning to feel at home.”\r\n\r\nMy uncle turned his goggles to her. “Ah! _this_ time it is home,\r\nSusan.... We got there.”\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt seems to me now but a step from the buying of Lady Grove to the\r\nbeginning of Crest Hill, from the days when the former was a stupendous\r\nachievement to the days when it was too small and dark and inconvenient\r\naltogether for a great financier’s use. For me that was a period of\r\nincreasing detachment from our business and the great world of London;\r\nI saw it more and more in broken glimpses, and sometimes I was working\r\nin my little pavilion above Lady Grove for a fortnight together; even\r\nwhen I came up it was often solely for a meeting of the aeronautical\r\nsociety or for one of the learned societies or to consult literature or\r\nemploy searchers or some such special business. For my uncle it was a\r\nperiod of stupendous inflation. Each time I met him I found him more\r\nconfident, more comprehensive, more consciously a factor in great\r\naffairs. Soon he was no longer an associate of merely business men; he\r\nwas big enough for the attentions of greater powers.\r\n\r\nI grew used to discovering some item of personal news about him in my\r\nevening paper, or to the sight of a full-page portrait of him in a\r\nsixpenny magazine. Usually the news was of some munificent act, some\r\nromantic piece of buying or giving or some fresh rumour of\r\nreconstruction. He saved, you will remember, the Parbury Reynolds for\r\nthe country. Or at times, it would be an interview or my uncle’s\r\ncontribution to some symposium on the “Secret of Success,” or such-like\r\ntopic. Or wonderful tales of his power of work, of his wonderful\r\norganisation to get things done, of his instant decisions and\r\nremarkable power of judging his fellow-men. They repeated his great\r\n_mot:_ “Eight hour working day—I want eighty hours!”\r\n\r\nHe became modestly but resolutely “public.” They cartooned him in\r\n_Vanity Fair_. One year my aunt, looking indeed a very gracious,\r\nslender lady, faced the portrait of the King in the great room at\r\nBurlington House, and the next year saw a medallion of my uncle by\r\nEwart, looking out upon the world, proud and imperial, but on the whole\r\na trifle too prominently convex, from the walls of the New Gallery.\r\n\r\nI shared only intermittently in his social experiences. People knew of\r\nme, it is true, and many of them sought to make through me a sort of\r\nflank attack upon him, and there was a legend, owing, very\r\nunreasonably, partly to my growing scientific reputation and partly to\r\nan element of reserve in my manner, that I played a much larger share\r\nin planning his operations than was actually the case. This led to one\r\nor two very intimate private dinners, to my inclusion in one or two\r\nhouse parties and various odd offers of introductions and services that\r\nI didn’t for the most part accept. Among other people who sought me in\r\nthis way was Archie Garvell, now a smart, impecunious soldier of no\r\nparticular distinction, who would, I think, have been quite prepared to\r\ndevelop any sporting instincts I possessed, and who was beautifully\r\nunaware of our former contact. He was always offering me winners; no\r\ndoubt in a spirit of anticipatory exchange for some really good thing\r\nin our more scientific and certain method of getting something for\r\nnothing....\r\n\r\nIn spite of my preoccupation with my experiments, work, I did, I find\r\nnow that I come to ransack my impressions, see a great deal of the\r\ngreat world during those eventful years; I had a near view of the\r\nmachinery by which an astounding Empire is run, rubbed shoulders and\r\nexchanged experiences with bishops and statesmen, political women and\r\nwomen who were not political, physicians and soldiers, artists and\r\nauthors, the directors of great journals, philanthropists and all sorts\r\nof eminent, significant people. I saw the statesmen without their\r\norders and the bishops with but a little purple silk left over from\r\ntheir canonicals, inhaling, not incensen but cigar smoke. I could look\r\nat them all the better because, for the most part, they were not\r\nlooking at me but at my uncle, and calculating consciously or\r\nunconsciously how they might use him and assimilate him to their\r\nsystem, the most unpremeditated, subtle, successful and aimless\r\nplutocracy that ever encumbered the destinies of mankind. Not one of\r\nthem, so far as I could see, until disaster overtook him, resented his\r\nlies, his almost naked dishonesty of method, the disorderly disturbance\r\nof this trade and that, caused by his spasmodic operations. I can see\r\nthem now about him, see them polite, watchful, various; his stiff\r\ncompact little figure always a centre of attention, his wiry hair, his\r\nbrief nose, his under-lip, electric with self-confidence. Wandering\r\nmarginally through distinguished gatherings, I would catch the\r\nwhispers: “That’s Mr. Ponderevo!”\r\n\r\n“The little man?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the little bounder with the glasses.”\r\n\r\n“They say he’s made—“...\r\n\r\nOr I would see him on some parterre of a platform beside my aunt’s\r\nhurraying hat, amidst titles and costumes, “holding his end up,” as he\r\nwould say, subscribing heavily to obvious charities, even at times\r\nmaking brief convulsive speeches in some good cause before the most\r\nexalted audiences. “Mr. Chairman, your Royal Highness, my Lords, Ladies\r\nand Gentlemen,” he would begin amidst subsiding applause and adjust\r\nthose obstinate glasses and thrust back the wings of his frock-coat and\r\nrest his hands upon his hips and speak his fragment with ever and again\r\nan incidental Zzzz. His hands would fret about him as he spoke, fiddle\r\nhis glasses, feel in his waistcoat pockets; ever and again he would\r\nrise slowly to his toes as a sentence unwound jerkily like a clockwork\r\nsnake, and drop back on his heels at the end. They were the very\r\ngestures of our first encounter when he had stood before the empty\r\nfireplace in his minute draped parlour and talked of my future to my\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nIn those measurelessly long hot afternoons in the little shop at\r\nWimblehurst he had talked and dreamt of the Romance of Modern Commerce.\r\nHere, surely, was his romance come true.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nPeople say that my uncle lost his head at the crest of his fortunes,\r\nbut if one may tell so much truth of a man one has in a manner loved,\r\nhe never had very much head to lose. He was always imaginative,\r\nerratic, inconsistent, recklessly inexact, and his inundation of wealth\r\nmerely gave him scope for these qualities. It is true, indeed, that\r\ntowards the climax he became intensely irritable at times and impatient\r\nof contradiction, but that, I think, was rather the gnawing uneasiness\r\nof sanity than any mental disturbance. But I find it hard either to\r\njudge him or convey the full development of him to the reader. I saw\r\ntoo much of him; my memory is choked with disarranged moods and\r\naspects. Now he is distended with megalomania, now he is deflated, now\r\nhe is quarrelsome, now impenetrably self-satisfied, but always he is\r\nsudden, jerky, fragmentary, energetic, and—in some subtle fundamental\r\nway that I find difficult to define—absurd.\r\n\r\nThere stands out—because of the tranquil beauty of its setting\r\nperhaps—a talk we had in the veranda of the little pavilion near my\r\nworksheds behind Crest Hill in which my aeroplanes and navigable\r\nballoons were housed. It was one of many similar conversations, and I\r\ndo not know why it in particular should survive its fellows. It happens\r\nso. He had come up to me after his coffee to consult me about a certain\r\nchalice which in a moment of splendour and under the importunity of a\r\ncountess he had determined to give to a deserving church in the\r\neast-end. I, in a moment of even rasher generosity, had suggested Ewart\r\nas a possible artist. Ewart had produced at once an admirable sketch\r\nfor the sacred vessel surrounded by a sort of wreath of Millies with\r\nopen arms and wings and had drawn fifty pounds on the strength of it.\r\nAfter that came a series of vexatious delays. The chalice became less\r\nand less of a commercial man’s chalice, acquired more and more the\r\nelusive quality of the Holy Grail, and at last even the drawing\r\nreceded.\r\n\r\nMy uncle grew restive.... “You see, George, they’ll begin to want the\r\nblasted thing!”\r\n\r\n“What blasted thing?”\r\n\r\n“That chalice, damn it! They’re beginning to ask questions. It isn’t\r\nBusiness, George.”\r\n\r\n“It’s art,” I protested, “and religion.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all very well. But it’s not a good ad for us, George, to make a\r\npromise and not deliver the goods.... I’ll have to write off your\r\nfriend Ewart as a bad debt, that’s what it comes to, and go to a decent\r\nfirm.”...\r\n\r\nWe sat outside on deck chairs in the veranda of the pavilion, smoked,\r\ndrank whisky, and, the chalice disposed of, meditated. His temporary\r\nannoyance passed. It was an altogether splendid summer night, following\r\na blazing, indolent day. Full moonlight brought out dimly the lines of\r\nthe receding hills, one wave beyond another; far beyond were the\r\npin-point lights of Leatherhead, and in the foreground the little stage\r\nfrom which I used to start upon my gliders gleamed like wet steel. The\r\nseason must have been high June, for down in the woods that hid the\r\nlights of the Lady Grove windows, I remember the nightingales thrilled\r\nand gurgled....\r\n\r\n“We got here, George,” said my uncle, ending a long pause. “Didn’t I\r\nsay?”\r\n\r\n“Say!—when?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“In that hole in the To’nem Court Road, eh? It’s been a Straight Square\r\nFight, and here we are!”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“’Member me telling you—Tono-Bungay?.... Well.... I’d just that\r\nafternoon thought of it!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve fancied at times;” I admitted.\r\n\r\n“It’s a great world, George, nowadays, with a fair chance for every one\r\nwho lays hold of things. The career ouvert to the Talons—eh?\r\nTono-Bungay. Think of it! It’s a great world and a growing world, and\r\nI’m glad we’re in it—and getting a pull. We’re getting big people,\r\nGeorge. Things come to us. Eh? This Palestine thing.”...\r\n\r\nHe meditated for a time and Zzzzed softly. Then he became still.\r\n\r\nHis theme was taken up by a cricket in the grass until he himself was\r\nready to resume it. The cricket too seemed to fancy that in some scheme\r\nof its own it had got there. “Chirrrrrrup” it said; “chirrrrrrup.”\r\n\r\n“Lord, what a place that was at Wimblehurst!” he broke out. “If ever I\r\nget a day off we’ll motor there, George, and run over that dog that\r\nsleeps in the High Street. Always was a dog asleep there—always.\r\nAlways... I’d like to see the old shop again. I daresay old Ruck still\r\nstands between the sheep at his door, grinning with all his teeth, and\r\nMarbel, silly beggar! comes out with his white apron on and a pencil\r\nstuck behind his ear, trying to look awake... Wonder if they know it’s\r\nme? I’d like ’em somehow to know it’s me.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll have had the International Tea Company and all sorts of people\r\ncutting them up,” I said. “And that dog’s been on the pavement this six\r\nyears—can’t sleep even there, poor dear, because of the motor-horns and\r\nits shattered nerves.”\r\n\r\n“Movin’ everywhere,” said my uncle. “I expect you’re right.... It’s a\r\nbig time we’re in, George. It’s a big Progressive On-coming Imperial\r\nTime. This Palestine business—the daring of it.... It’s, it’s a\r\nProcess, George. And we got our hands on it. Here we sit—with our hands\r\non it, George. Entrusted.\r\n\r\n“It seems quiet to—night. But if we could see and hear.” He waved his\r\ncigar towards Leatherhead and London.\r\n\r\n“There they are, millions, George. Jes’ think of what they’ve been up\r\nto to-day—those ten millions—each one doing his own particular job. You\r\ncan’t grasp it. It’s like old Whitman says—what is it he says? Well,\r\nanyway it’s like old Whitman. Fine chap, Whitman! Fine old chap! Queer,\r\nyou can’t quote him. ... And these millions aren’t anything. There’s\r\nthe millions over seas, hundreds of millions, Chinese, M’rocco, Africa\r\ngenerally, ’Merica.... Well, here we are, with power, with leisure,\r\npicked out—because we’ve been energetic, because we’ve seized\r\nopportunities, because we’ve made things hum when other people have\r\nwaited for them to hum. See? Here we are—with our hands on it. Big\r\npeople. Big growing people. In a sort of way,—Forces.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. “It’s wonderful, George,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Anglo-Saxon energy,” I said softly to the night.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, George—energy. It’s put things in our grip—threads, wires,\r\nstretching out and out, George, from that little office of ours, out to\r\nWest Africa, out to Egypt, out to Inja, out east, west, north and\r\nsouth. Running the world practically. Running it faster and faster.\r\nCreative. There’s that Palestine canal affair. Marvellous idee! Suppose\r\nwe take that up, suppose we let ourselves in for it, us and the others,\r\nand run that water sluice from the Mediterranean into the Dead Sea\r\nValley—think of the difference it will make! All the desert blooming\r\nlike a rose, Jericho lost for ever, all the Holy Places under water....\r\nVery likely destroy Christianity.”...\r\n\r\nHe mused for a space. “Cuttin’ canals,” murmured my uncle. “Making\r\ntunnels.... New countries.... New centres.... Zzzz.... Finance.... Not\r\nonly Palestine.\r\n\r\n“I wonder where we shall get before we done, George? We got a lot of\r\nbig things going. We got the investing public sound and sure. I don’t\r\nsee why in the end we shouldn’t be very big. There’s difficulties but\r\nI’m equal to them. We’re still a bit soft in our bones, but they’ll\r\nharden all right.... I suppose, after all, I’m worth something like a\r\nmillion, George, cleared up and settled. If I got out of things now.\r\nIt’s a great time, George, a wonderful time!”...\r\n\r\nI glanced through the twilight at his convexity and I must confess it\r\nstruck me that on the whole he wasn’t particularly good value.\r\n\r\n“We got our hands on things, George, us big people. We got to hang\r\ntogether, George run the show. Join up with the old order like that\r\nmill-wheel of Kipling’s. (Finest thing he ever wrote, George; I jes’\r\nbeen reading it again. Made me buy Lady Grove.) Well, we got to run the\r\ncountry, George. It’s ours. Make it a Scientific Organised Business\r\nEnterprise. Put idees into it. ’Lectrify it. Run the Press. Run all\r\nsorts of developments. All sorts of developments. I been talking to\r\nLord Boom. I been talking to all sorts of people. Great things.\r\nProgress. The world on business lines. Only jes’ beginning.”...\r\n\r\nHe fell into a deep meditation.\r\n\r\nHe Zzzzed for a time and ceased.\r\n\r\n“_Yes_,” he said at last in the tone of a man who has at last emerged\r\nwith ultimate solutions to the profoundest problems.\r\n\r\n“What?” I said after a seemly pause.\r\n\r\nMy uncle hung fire for a moment and it seemed to me the fate of nations\r\ntrembled in the balance. Then he spoke as one who speaks from the very\r\nbottom of his heart—and I think it was the very bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\n“I’d jes’ like to drop into the Eastry Arms, jes’ when all those\r\nbeggars in the parlour are sittin’ down to whist, Ruck and Marbel and\r\nall, and give ’em ten minutes of my mind, George. Straight from the\r\nshoulder. Jes’ exactly what I think of them. It’s a little thing, but\r\nI’d like to do it jes’ once before I die.”...\r\n\r\nHe rested on that for some time Zzzz-ing.\r\n\r\nThen he broke out at a new place in a tone of detached criticism.\r\n\r\n“There’s Boom,” he reflected.\r\n\r\n“It’s a wonderful system this old British system, George. It’s staid\r\nand stable and yet it has a place for new men. We come up and take our\r\nplaces. It’s almost expected. We take a hand. That’s where our\r\nDemocracy differs from America. Over there a man succeeds; all he gets\r\nis money. Here there’s a system open to every one—practically.... Chaps\r\nlike Boom—come from nowhere.”\r\n\r\nHis voice ceased. I reflected upon the spirit of his words. Suddenly I\r\nkicked my feet in the air, rolled on my side and sat up suddenly on my\r\ndeck chair with my legs down.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean it!” I said.\r\n\r\n“Mean what, George?”\r\n\r\n“Subscription to the party funds. Reciprocal advantage. Have we got to\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“Whad you driving at, George?”\r\n\r\n“You know. They’d never do it, man!”\r\n\r\n“Do what?” he said feebly; and, “Why shouldn’t they?”\r\n\r\n“They’d not even go to a baronetcy. _No!_.... And yet, of course,\r\nthere’s Boom! And Collingshead and Gorver. They’ve done beer, they’ve\r\ndone snippets! After all Tono-Bungay—it’s not like a turf commission\r\nagent or anything like that!... There have of course been some very\r\ngentlemanly commission agents. It isn’t like a fool of a scientific man\r\nwho can’t make money!”\r\n\r\nMy uncle grunted; we’d differed on that issue before.\r\n\r\nA malignant humour took possession of me. “What would they call you?” I\r\nspeculated. “The vicar would like Duffield. Too much like Duffer!\r\nDifficult thing, a title.” I ran my mind over various possibilities.\r\n“Why not take a leaf from a socialist tract I came upon yesterday. Chap\r\nsays we’re all getting delocalised. Beautiful word—delocalised! Why not\r\nbe the first delocalised peer? That gives you—Tono-Bungay! There is a\r\nBungay, you know. Lord Tono of Bungay—in bottles everywhere. Eh?”\r\n\r\nMy uncle astonished me by losing his temper.\r\n\r\n“Damn it. George, you don’t seem to see I’m serious! You’re always\r\nsneering at Tono-Bungay! As though it was some sort of swindle. It was\r\nperfec’ly legitimate trade, perfec’ly legitimate. Good value and a good\r\narticle.... When I come up here and tell you plans and exchange\r\nidees—you sneer at me. You _do_. You don’t see—it’s a big thing. It’s a\r\nbig thing. You got to get used to new circumstances. You got to face\r\nwhat lies before us. You got to drop that tone.”\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nMy uncle was not altogether swallowed up in business and ambition. He\r\nkept in touch with modern thought. For example, he was, I know, greatly\r\nswayed by what he called “This Overman idee, Nietzsche—all that stuff.”\r\n\r\nHe mingled those comforting suggestions of a potent and exceptional\r\nhuman being emancipated from the pettier limitations of integrity with\r\nthe Napoleonic legend. It gave his imagination a considerable outlet.\r\nThat Napoleonic legend! The real mischief of Napoleon’s immensely\r\ndisastrous and accidental career began only when he was dead and the\r\nromantic type of mind was free to elaborate his character. I do believe\r\nthat my uncle would have made a far less egregious smash if there had\r\nbeen no Napoleonic legend to misguide him. He was in many ways better\r\nand infinitely kinder than his career. But when in doubt between decent\r\nconduct and a base advantage, that cult came in more and more\r\ninfluentially: “think of Napoleon; think what the inflexibly-wilful\r\nNapoleon would have done with such scruples as yours;” that was the\r\nrule, and the end was invariably a new step in dishonour.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was in an unsystematic way a collector of Napoleonic relics;\r\nthe bigger the book about his hero the more readily he bought it; he\r\npurchased letters and tinsel and weapons that bore however remotely\r\nupon the Man of Destiny, and he even secured in Geneva, though he never\r\nbrought home, an old coach in which Buonaparte might have ridden; he\r\ncrowded the quiet walls of Lady Grove with engravings and figures of\r\nhim, preferring, my aunt remarked, the more convex portraits with the\r\nwhite vest and those statuettes with the hands behind the back which\r\nthrew forward the figure. The Durgans watched him through it all,\r\nsardonically.\r\n\r\nAnd he would stand after breakfast at times in the light of the window\r\nat Lady Grove, a little apart, with two fingers of one hand stuck\r\nbetween his waistcoat-buttons and his chin sunken, thinking,—the most\r\npreposterous little fat man in the world. It made my aunt feel, she\r\nsaid, “like an old Field Marshal—knocks me into a cocked hat, George!”\r\n\r\nPerhaps this Napoleonic bias made him a little less frequent with his\r\ncigars than he would otherwise have been, but of that I cannot be sure,\r\nand it certainly caused my aunt a considerable amount of vexation after\r\nhe had read _Napoleon and the Fair Sex_, because for a time that roused\r\nhim to a sense of a side of life he had in his commercial\r\npreoccupations very largely forgotten. Suggestion plays so great a part\r\nin this field. My uncle took the next opportunity and had an “affair”!\r\n\r\nIt was not a very impassioned affair, and the exact particulars never\r\nof course reached me. It is quite by chance I know anything of it at\r\nall. One evening I was surprised to come upon my uncle in a mixture of\r\nBohemia and smart people at an At Home in the flat of Robbert, the R.A.\r\nwho painted my aunt, and he was standing a little apart in a recess,\r\ntalking or rather being talked to in undertones by a plump, blond\r\nlittle woman in pale blue, a Helen Scrymgeour who wrote novels and was\r\norganising a weekly magazine. I elbowed a large lady who was saying\r\nsomething about them, but I didn’t need to hear the thing she said to\r\nperceive the relationship of the two. It hit me like a placard on a\r\nhoarding. I was amazed the whole gathering did not see it. Perhaps they\r\ndid. She was wearing a remarkably fine diamond necklace, much too fine\r\nfor journalism, and regarding him with that quality of questionable\r\nproprietorship, of leashed but straining intimacy, that seems\r\ninseparable from this sort of affair. It is so much more palpable than\r\nmatrimony. If anything was wanted to complete my conviction it was my\r\nuncles’s eyes when presently he became aware of mine, a certain\r\nembarrassment and a certain pride and defiance. And the next day he\r\nmade an opportunity to praise the lady’s intelligence to me concisely,\r\nlest I should miss the point of it all.\r\n\r\nAfter that I heard some gossip—from a friend of the lady’s. I was much\r\ntoo curious to do anything but listen. I had never in all my life\r\nimagined my uncle in an amorous attitude. It would appear that she\r\ncalled him her “God in the Car”—after the hero in a novel of Anthony\r\nHope’s. It was essential to the convention of their relations that he\r\nshould go relentlessly whenever business called, and it was generally\r\narranged that it did call. To him women were an incident, it was\r\nunderstood between them; Ambition was the master-passion. A great world\r\ncalled him and the noble hunger for Power. I have never been able to\r\ndiscover just how honest Mrs. Scrymgeour was in all this, but it is\r\nquite possible the immense glamour of his financial largeness prevailed\r\nwith her and that she did bring a really romantic feeling to their\r\nencounters. There must have been some extraordinary moments....\r\n\r\nI was a good deal exercised and distressed about my aunt when I\r\nrealised what was afoot. I thought it would prove a terrible\r\nhumiliation to her. I suspected her of keeping up a brave front with\r\nthe loss of my uncle’s affections fretting at her heart, but there I\r\nsimply underestimated her. She didn’t hear for some time and when she\r\ndid hear she was extremely angry and energetic. The sentimental\r\nsituation didn’t trouble her for a moment. She decided that my uncle\r\n“wanted smacking.” She accentuated herself with an unexpected new hat,\r\nwent and gave him an inconceivable talking-to at the Hardingham, and\r\nthen came round to “blow-up” me for not telling her what was going on\r\nbefore....\r\n\r\nI tried to bring her to a proper sense of the accepted values in this\r\naffair, but my aunt’s originality of outlook was never so invincible.\r\n“Men don’t tell on one another in affairs of passion,” I protested, and\r\nsuch-like worldly excuses.\r\n\r\n“Women!” she said in high indignation, “and men! It isn’t women and\r\nmen—it’s him and me, George! Why don’t you talk sense?\r\n\r\n“Old passion’s all very well, George, in its way, and I’m the last\r\nperson to be jealous. But this is old nonsense.... I’m not going to let\r\nhim show off what a silly old lobster he is to other women.... I’ll\r\nmark every scrap of his underclothes with red letters,\r\n‘Ponderevo-Private’—every scrap.\r\n\r\n“Going about making love indeed,—in abdominal belts!—at his time of\r\nlife!”\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine what passed between her and my uncle. But I have no\r\ndoubt that for once her customary badinage was laid aside. How they\r\ntalked then I do not know, for I who knew them so well had never heard\r\nthat much of intimacy between them. At any rate it was a concerned and\r\npreoccupied “God in the Car” I had to deal with in the next few days,\r\nunusually Zzzz-y and given to slight impatient gestures that had\r\nnothing to do with the current conversation. And it was evident that in\r\nall directions he was finding things unusually difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nAll the intimate moments in this affair were hidden from me, but in the\r\nend my aunt triumphed. He did not so much throw as jerk over Mrs.\r\nScrymgeour, and she did not so much make a novel of it as upset a huge\r\npailful of attenuated and adulterated female soul upon this occasion.\r\nMy aunt did not appear in that, even remotely. So that it is doubtful\r\nif the lady knew the real causes of her abandonment. The Napoleonic\r\nhero was practically unmarried, and he threw over his lady as Napoleon\r\nthrew over Josephine for a great alliance.\r\n\r\nIt was a triumph for my aunt, but it had its price. For some time it\r\nwas evident things were strained between them. He gave up the lady, but\r\nhe resented having to do so, deeply. She had meant more to his\r\nimagination than one could have supposed. He wouldn’t for a long time\r\n“come round.” He became touchy and impatient and secretive towards my\r\naunt, and she, I noted, after an amazing check or so, stopped that\r\nstream of kindly abuse that had flowed for so long and had been so\r\ngreat a refreshment in their lives. They were both the poorer for its\r\ncessation, both less happy. She devoted herself more and more to Lady\r\nGrove and the humours and complications of its management. The servants\r\ntook to her—as they say—she god-mothered three Susans during her rule,\r\nthe coachman’s, the gardener’s, and the Up Hill gamekeeper’s. She got\r\ntogether a library of old household books that were in the vein of the\r\nplace. She revived the still-room, and became a great artist in jellies\r\nand elder and cowslip wine.\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nAnd while I neglected the development of my uncle’s finances—and my\r\nown, in my scientific work and my absorbing conflict with the\r\ndifficulties of flying,—his schemes grew more and more expansive and\r\nhazardous, and his spending wilder and laxer. I believe that a haunting\r\nsense of the intensifying unsoundness of his position accounts largely\r\nfor his increasing irritability and his increasing secretiveness with\r\nmy aunt and myself during these crowning years. He dreaded, I think,\r\nhaving to explain, he feared our jests might pierce unwittingly to the\r\ntruth. Even in the privacy of his mind he would not face the truth. He\r\nwas accumulating unrealisable securities in his safes until they hung a\r\npotential avalanche over the economic world. But his buying became a\r\nfever, and his restless desire to keep it up with himself that he was\r\nmaking a triumphant progress to limitless wealth gnawed deeper and\r\ndeeper. A curious feature of this time with him was his buying over and\r\nover again of similar things. His ideas seemed to run in series. Within\r\na twelve-month he bought five new motor-cars, each more swift and\r\npowerful than its predecessor, and only the repeated prompt resignation\r\nof his chief chauffeur at each moment of danger, prevented his driving\r\nthem himself. He used them more and more. He developed a passion for\r\nlocomotion for its own sake.\r\n\r\nThen he began to chafe at Lady Grove, fretted by a chance jest he had\r\noverheard at a dinner. “This house, George,” he said. “It’s a misfit.\r\nThere’s no elbow-room in it; it’s choked with old memories. And I can’t\r\nstand all these damned Durgans!\r\n\r\n“That chap in the corner, George. No! the other corner! The man in a\r\ncherry-coloured coat. He watched you! He’d look silly if I stuck a\r\npoker through his Gizzard!”\r\n\r\n“He’d look,” I reflected, “much as he does now. As though he was\r\namused.”\r\n\r\nHe replaced his glasses, which had fallen at his emotion, and glared at\r\nhis antagonists. “What are they? What are they all, the lot of ’em?\r\nDead as Mutton! They just stuck in the mud. They didn’t even rise to\r\nthe Reformation. The old out-of-date Reformation! Move with the\r\ntimes!—they moved against the times.\r\n\r\n“Just a Family of Failure,—they never even tried!\r\n\r\n“They’re jes’, George, exactly what I’m not. Exactly. It isn’t\r\nsuitable.... All this living in the Past.\r\n\r\n“And I want a bigger place too, George. I want air and sunlight and\r\nroom to move about and more service. A house where you can get a Move\r\non things! Zzzz. Why! it’s like a discord—it jars—even to have the\r\ntelephone.... There’s nothing, nothing except the terrace, that’s worth\r\na Rap. It’s all dark and old and dried up and full of old-fashioned\r\nthings—musty old idees—fitter for a silver-fish than a modern man.... I\r\ndon’t know how I got here.”\r\n\r\nHe broke out into a new grievance. “That damned vicar,” he complained,\r\n“thinks I ought to think myself lucky to get this place! Every time I\r\nmeet him I can see him think it.... One of these days, George I’ll show\r\nhim what a Mod’un house is like!”\r\n\r\nAnd he did.\r\n\r\nI remember the day when he declared, as Americans say, for Crest Hill.\r\nHe had come up to see my new gas plant, for I was then only just\r\nbeginning to experiment with auxiliary collapsible balloons, and all\r\nthe time the shine of his glasses was wandering away to the open down\r\nbeyond. “Let’s go back to Lady Grove over the hill,” he said.\r\n“Something I want to show you. Something fine!”\r\n\r\nIt was an empty sunlit place that summer evening, sky and earth warm\r\nwith sundown, and a pe-wit or so just accentuating the pleasant\r\nstillness that ends a long clear day. A beautiful peace, it was, to\r\nwreck for ever. And there was my uncle, the modern man of power, in his\r\ngrey top-hat and his grey suit and his black-ribboned glasses, short,\r\nthin-legged, large-stomached, pointing and gesticulating, threatening\r\nthis calm.\r\n\r\nHe began with a wave of his arm. “That’s the place, George,” he said.\r\n“See?”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” I cried—for I had been thinking of remote things.\r\n\r\n“I got it.”\r\n\r\n“Got what?”\r\n\r\n“For a house!—a Twentieth Century house! That’s the place for it!”\r\n\r\nOne of his characteristic phrases was begotten in him.\r\n\r\n“Four-square to the winds of heaven, George!” he said. “Eh? Four-square\r\nto the winds of heaven!”\r\n\r\n“You’ll get the winds up here,” I said.\r\n\r\n“A mammoth house it ought to be, George—to suit these hills.”\r\n\r\n“Quite,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Great galleries and things—running out there and there—See? I been\r\nthinking of it, George! Looking out all this way—across the Weald. With\r\nits back to Lady Grove.”\r\n\r\n“And the morning sun in its eye.”\r\n\r\n“Like an eagle, George,—like an eagle!”\r\n\r\nSo he broached to me what speedily became the leading occupation of his\r\nculminating years, Crest Hill. But all the world has heard of that\r\nextravagant place which grew and changed its plans as it grew, and\r\nbubbled like a salted snail, and burgeoned and bulged and evermore\r\ngrew. I know not what delirium of pinnacles and terraces and arcades\r\nand corridors glittered at last upon the uplands of his mind; the\r\nplace, for all that its expansion was terminated abruptly by our\r\ncollapse, is wonderful enough as it stands,—that empty instinctive\r\nbuilding of a childless man. His chief architect was a young man named\r\nWestminster, whose work he had picked out in the architecture room of\r\nthe Royal Academy on account of a certain grandiose courage in it, but\r\nwith him he associated from time to time a number of fellow\r\nprofessionals, stonemasons, sanitary engineers, painters, sculptors,\r\nscribes, metal workers, wood carvers, furniture designers, ceramic\r\nspecialists, landscape gardeners, and the man who designs the\r\narrangement and ventilation of the various new houses in the London\r\nZoological Gardens. In addition he had his own ideas. The thing\r\noccupied his mind at all times, but it held it completely from Friday\r\nnight to Monday morning. He would come down to Lady Grove on Friday\r\nnight in a crowded motor-car that almost dripped architects. He didn’t,\r\nhowever, confine himself to architects; every one was liable to an\r\ninvitation to week-end and view Crest Hill, and many an eager promoter,\r\nunaware of how Napoleonically and completely my uncle had\r\ndepartmentalised his mind, tried to creep up to him by way of tiles and\r\nventilators and new electric fittings. Always on Sunday mornings,\r\nunless the weather was vile, he would, so soon as breakfast and his\r\nsecretaries were disposed of, visit the site with a considerable\r\nretinue, and alter and develop plans, making modifications, Zzzz-ing,\r\ngiving immense new orders verbally—an unsatisfactory way, as\r\nWestminster and the contractors ultimately found.\r\n\r\nThere he stands in my memory, the symbol of this age for me, the man of\r\nluck and advertisement, the current master of the world. There he\r\nstands upon the great outward sweep of the terrace before the huge main\r\nentrance, a little figure, ridiculously disproportionate to that\r\nforty-foot arch, with the granite ball behind him—the astronomical\r\nball, brass coopered, that represented the world, with a little\r\nadjustable tube of lenses on a gun-metal arm that focussed the sun upon\r\njust that point of the earth on which it chanced to be shining\r\nvertically. There he stands, Napoleonically grouped with his retinue\r\nmen in tweeds and golfing-suits, a little solicitor, whose name I\r\nforget, in grey trousers and a black jacket, and Westminster in Jaeger\r\nunderclothing, a floriferous tie, and peculiar brown cloth of his own.\r\n\r\nThe downland breeze flutters my uncle’s coat-tails, disarranges his\r\nstiff hair, and insists on the evidence of undisciplined appetites in\r\nface and form, as he points out this or that feature in the prospect to\r\nhis attentive collaborator.\r\n\r\nBelow are hundreds of feet of wheeling-planks, ditches, excavations,\r\nheaps of earth, piles of garden stone from the Wealden ridges. On\r\neither hand the walls of his irrelevant unmeaning palace rise at one\r\ntime he had working in that place—disturbing the economic balance of\r\nthe whole countryside by their presence—upwards of three thousand\r\nmen....\r\n\r\nSo he poses for my picture amidst the raw beginnings that were never to\r\nbe completed. He did the strangest things about that place, things more\r\nand more detached from any conception of financial scale, things more\r\nand more apart from sober humanity. He seemed to think himself, at\r\nlast, released from any such limitations. He moved a quite considerable\r\nhill, and nearly sixty mature trees were moved with it to open his\r\nprospect eastward, moved it about two hundred feet to the south. At\r\nanother time he caught a suggestion from some city restaurant and made\r\na billiard-room roofed with plate glass beneath the waters of his\r\nornamental lake. He furnished one wing while its roof still awaited\r\ncompletion. He had a swimming bath thirty feet square next to his\r\nbedroom upstairs, and to crown it all he commenced a great wall to hold\r\nall his dominions together, free from the invasion of common men. It\r\nwas a ten-foot wall, glass surmounted, and had it been completed as he\r\nintended it, it would have had a total length of nearly eleven miles.\r\nSome of it towards the last was so dishonestly built that it collapsed\r\nwithin a year upon its foundations, but some miles of it still stand. I\r\nnever think of it now but what I think of the hundreds of eager little\r\ninvestors who followed his “star,” whose hopes and lives, whose wives’\r\nsecurity and children’s prospects are all mixed up beyond redemption\r\nwith that flaking mortar....\r\n\r\nIt is curious how many of these modern financiers of chance and bluff\r\nhave ended their careers by building. It was not merely my uncle.\r\nSooner or later they all seem to bring their luck to the test of\r\nrealisation, try to make their fluid opulence coagulate out as bricks\r\nand mortar, bring moonshine into relations with a weekly wages-sheet.\r\nThen the whole fabric of confidence and imagination totters—and down\r\nthey come....\r\n\r\nWhen I think of that despoiled hillside, that colossal litter of bricks\r\nand mortar, and crude roads and paths, the scaffolding and sheds, the\r\ngeneral quality of unforeseeing outrage upon the peace of nature, I am\r\nreminded of a chat I had with the vicar one bleak day after he had\r\nwitnessed a glide. He talked to me of aeronautics as I stood in jersey\r\nand shorts beside my machine, fresh from alighting, and his cadaverous\r\nface failed to conceal a peculiar desolation that possessed him.\r\n\r\n“Almost you convince me,” he said, coming up to me, “against my\r\nwill.... A marvellous invention! But it will take you a long time, sir,\r\nbefore you can emulate that perfect mechanism—the wing of a bird.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at my sheds.\r\n\r\n“You’ve changed the look of this valley, too,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Temporary defilements,” I remarked, guessing what was in his mind.\r\n\r\n“Of course. Things come and go. Things come and go. But—H’m. I’ve just\r\nbeen up over the hill to look at Mr. Edward Ponderevo’s new house.\r\nThat—that is something more permanent. A magnificent place!—in many\r\nways. Imposing. I’ve never somehow brought myself to go that way\r\nbefore. Things are greatly advanced.... We find—the great number of\r\nstrangers introduced into the villages about here by these operations,\r\nworking-men chiefly, a little embarrassing. It put us out. They bring a\r\nnew spirit into the place; betting—ideas—all sorts of queer notions.\r\nOur publicans like it, of course. And they come and sleep in one’s\r\nouthouses—and make the place a little unsafe at nights. The other\r\nmorning I couldn’t sleep—a slight dyspepsia—and I looked out of the\r\nwindow. I was amazed to see people going by on bicycles. A silent\r\nprocession. I counted ninety-seven—in the dawn. All going up to the new\r\nroad for Crest Hill. Remarkable I thought it. And so I’ve been up to\r\nsee what they were doing.”\r\n\r\n“They would have been more than remarkable thirty years ago,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed. Things change. We think nothing of it now at\r\nall—comparatively. And that big house—”\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyebrows. “Really stupendous! Stupendous.\r\n\r\n“All the hillside—the old turf—cut to ribbons!”\r\n\r\nHis eye searched my face. “We’ve grown so accustomed to look up to Lady\r\nGrove,” he said, and smiled in search of sympathy. “It shifts our\r\ncentre of gravity.”\r\n\r\n“Things will readjust themselves,” I lied.\r\n\r\nHe snatched at the phrase. “Of course,” he said.\r\n\r\n“They’ll readjust themselves—settle down again. Must. In the old way.\r\nIt’s bound to come right again—a comforting thought. Yes. After all,\r\nLady Grove itself had to be built once upon a time—was—to begin\r\nwith—artificial.”\r\n\r\nHis eye returned to my aeroplane. He sought to dismiss his graver\r\npreoccupations. “I should think twice,” he remarked, “before I trusted\r\nmyself to that concern.... But I suppose one grows accustomed to the\r\nmotion.”\r\n\r\nHe bade me good morning and went his way, bowed and thoughtful....\r\n\r\nHe had kept the truth from his mind a long time, but that morning it\r\nhad forced its way to him with an aspect that brooked no denial that\r\nthis time it was not just changes that were coming in his world, but\r\nthat all his world lay open and defenceless, conquered and surrendered,\r\ndoomed so far as he could see, root and branch, scale and form alike,\r\nto change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\r\nSOARING\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFor nearly all the time that my uncle was incubating and hatching Crest\r\nHill I was busy in a little transverse valley between that great\r\nbeginning and Lady Grove with more and more costly and ambitious\r\nexperiments in aerial navigation. This work was indeed the main\r\nsubstance of my life through all the great time of the Tono-Bungay\r\nsymphony.\r\n\r\nI have told already how I came to devote myself to this system of\r\ninquiries, how in a sort of disgust with the common adventure of life I\r\ntook up the dropped ends of my college studies, taking them up again\r\nwith a man’s resolution instead of a boy’s ambition. From the first I\r\ndid well at this work. It—was, I think, largely a case of special\r\naptitude, of a peculiar irrelevant vein of faculty running through my\r\nmind. It is one of those things men seem to have by chance, that has\r\nlittle or nothing to do with their general merit, and which it is\r\nridiculous to be either conceited or modest about. I did get through a\r\nvery big mass of work in those years, working for a time with a\r\nconcentrated fierceness that left little of such energy or capacity as\r\nI possess unused. I worked out a series of problems connected with the\r\nstability of bodies pitching in the air and the internal movements of\r\nthe wind, and I also revolutionised one leading part at last of the\r\ntheory of explosive engines. These things are to be found in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_, the _Mathematical Journal_, and less\r\nfrequently in one or two other such publications, and they needn’t\r\ndetain us here. Indeed, I doubt if I could write about them here. One\r\nacquires a sort of shorthand for one’s notes and mind in relation to\r\nsuch special work. I have never taught; nor lectured, that is to say, I\r\nhave never had to express my thoughts about mechanical things in\r\nordinary everyday language, and I doubt very much if I could do so now\r\nwithout extreme tedium.\r\n\r\nMy work was, to begin with, very largely theoretical. I was able to\r\nattack such early necessities of verification as arose with quite\r\nlittle models, using a turntable to get the motion through the air, and\r\ncane, whalebone and silk as building material. But a time came when\r\nincalculable factors crept in, factors of human capacity and factors of\r\ninsufficient experimental knowledge, when one must needs guess and try.\r\nThen I had to enlarge the scale of my operations, and soon I had\r\nenlarged them very greatly. I set to work almost concurrently on the\r\nbalance and stability of gliders and upon the steering of inflated\r\nbags, the latter a particularly expensive branch of work. I was no\r\ndoubt moved by something of the same spirit of lavish expenditure that\r\nwas running away with my uncle in these developments. Presently my\r\nestablishment above Lady Grove had grown to a painted wood chalet big\r\nenough to accommodate six men, and in which I would sometimes live for\r\nthree weeks together; to a gasometer, to a motor-house, to three big\r\ncorrugated-roofed sheds and lock-up houses, to a stage from which to\r\nstart gliders, to a workshop and so forth. A rough road was made. We\r\nbrought up gas from Cheaping and electricity from Woking, which place I\r\nfound also afforded a friendly workshop for larger operations than I\r\ncould manage. I had the luck also to find a man who seemed my\r\nheaven-sent second-in-command—Cothope his name was. He was a\r\nself-educated-man; he had formerly been a sapper and he was one of the\r\nbest and handiest working engineers alive. Without him I do not think I\r\ncould have achieved half what I have done. At times he has been not so\r\nmuch my assistant as my collaborator, and has followed my fortunes to\r\nthis day. Other men came and went as I needed them.\r\n\r\nI do not know how far it is possible to convey to any one who has not\r\nexperienced it, the peculiar interest, the peculiar satisfaction that\r\nlies in a sustained research when one is not hampered by want of money.\r\nIt is a different thing from any other sort of human effort. You are\r\nfree from the exasperating conflict with your fellow-creatures\r\naltogether—at least so far as the essential work goes; that for me is\r\nits peculiar merit. Scientific truth is the remotest of mistresses; she\r\nhides in strange places, she is attained by tortuous and laborious\r\nroads, but _she is always there!_ Win to her and she will not fail you;\r\nshe is yours and mankind’s for ever. She is reality, the one reality I\r\nhave found in this strange disorder of existence. She will not sulk\r\nwith you nor misunderstand you nor cheat you of your reward upon some\r\npetty doubt. You cannot change her by advertisement or clamour, nor\r\nstifle her in vulgarities. Things grow under your hands when you serve\r\nher, things that are permanent as nothing else is permanent in the\r\nwhole life of man. That, I think, is the peculiar satisfaction of\r\nscience and its enduring reward....\r\n\r\nThe taking up of experimental work produced a great change in my\r\npersonal habits. I have told how already once in my life at Wimblehurst\r\nI had a period of discipline and continuous effort, and how, when I\r\ncame to South Kensington, I became demoralised by the immense effect of\r\nLondon, by its innumerable imperative demands upon my attention and\r\ncuriosity. And I parted with much of my personal pride when I gave up\r\nscience for the development of Tono-Bungay. But my poverty kept me\r\nabstinent and my youthful romanticism kept me chaste until my married\r\nlife was well under way. Then in all directions I relaxed. I did a\r\nlarge amount of work, but I never troubled to think whether it was my\r\nmaximum nor whether the moods and indolences that came to me at times\r\nwere avoidable things. With the coming of plenty I ate abundantly and\r\nfoolishly, drank freely and followed my impulses more and more\r\ncarelessly. I felt no reason why I should do anything else. Never at\r\nany point did I use myself to the edge of my capacity. The emotional\r\ncrisis of my divorce did not produce any immediate change in these\r\nmatters of personal discipline. I found some difficulty at first in\r\nconcentrating my mind upon scientific work, it was so much more\r\nexacting than business, but I got over that difficulty by smoking. I\r\nbecame an inordinate cigar smoker; it gave me moods of profound\r\ndepression, but I treated these usually by the homeopathic method,—by\r\nlighting another cigar. I didn’t realise at all how loose my moral and\r\nnervous fibre had become until I reached the practical side of my\r\ninvestigations and was face to face with the necessity of finding out\r\njust how it felt to use a glider and just what a man could do with one.\r\n\r\nI got into this relaxed habit of living in spite of very real\r\ntendencies in my nature towards discipline. I’ve never been in love\r\nwith self-indulgence. That philosophy of the loose lip and the lax\r\npaunch is one for which I’ve always had an instinctive distrust. I like\r\nbare things, stripped things, plain, austere and continent things, fine\r\nlines and cold colours. But in these plethoric times when there is too\r\nmuch coarse stuff for everybody and the struggle for life takes the\r\nform of competitive advertisement and the effort to fill your\r\nneighbour’s eye, when there is no urgent demand either for personal\r\ncourage, sound nerves or stark beauty, we find ourselves by accident.\r\nAlways before these times the bulk of the people did not over-eat\r\nthemselves, because they couldn’t, whether they wanted to do so or not,\r\nand all but a very few were kept “fit” by unavoidable exercise and\r\npersonal danger. Now, if only he pitch his standard low enough and keep\r\nfree from pride, almost any one can achieve a sort of excess. You can\r\ngo through contemporary life fudging and evading, indulging and\r\nslacking, never really hungry nor frightened nor passionately stirred,\r\nyour highest moment a mere sentimental orgasm, and your first real\r\ncontact with primary and elemental necessities, the sweat of your\r\ndeath-bed. So I think it was with my uncle; so, very nearly, it was\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nBut the glider brought me up smartly. I had to find out how these\r\nthings went down the air, and the only way to find out is to go down\r\nwith one. And for a time I wouldn’t face it.\r\n\r\nThere is something impersonal about a book, I suppose. At any rate I\r\nfind myself able to write down here just the confession I’ve never been\r\nable to make to any one face to face, the frightful trouble it was to\r\nme to bring myself to do what I suppose every other coloured boy in the\r\nWest Indies could do without turning a hair, and that is to fling\r\nmyself off for my first soar down the wind. The first trial was bound\r\nto be the worst; it was an experiment I made with life, and the chance\r\nof death or injury was, I supposed, about equal to the chance of\r\nsuccess. I believed that with a dawn-like lucidity. I had begun with a\r\nglider that I imagined was on the lines of the Wright brothers’\r\naeroplane, but I could not be sure. It might turn over. I might upset\r\nit. It might burrow its nose at the end and smash itself and me. The\r\nconditions of the flight necessitated alert attention; it wasn’t a\r\nthing to be done by jumping off and shutting one’s eyes or getting\r\nangry or drunk to do it. One had to use one’s weight to balance. And\r\nwhen at last I did it it was horrible—for ten seconds. For ten seconds\r\nor so, as I swept down the air flattened on my infernal framework and\r\nwith the wind in my eyes, the rush of the ground beneath me filled me\r\nwith sick and helpless terror; I felt as though some violent\r\noscillatory current was throbbing in brain and back bone, and I groaned\r\naloud. I set my teeth and groaned. It was a groan wrung out of me in\r\nspite of myself. My sensations of terror swooped to a climax. And then,\r\nyou know, they ended!\r\n\r\nSuddenly my terror was over and done with. I was soaring through the\r\nair right way up, steadily, and no mischance had happened. I felt\r\nintensely alive and my nerves were strung like a bow. I shifted a limb,\r\nswerved and shouted between fear and triumph as I recovered from the\r\nswerve and heeled the other way and steadied myself.\r\n\r\nI thought I was going to hit a rook that was flying athwart me,—it was\r\nqueer with what projectile silence that jumped upon me out of\r\nnothingness, and I yelled helplessly, “Get out of the way!” The bird\r\ndoubled itself up like a partly inverted V, flapped, went up to the\r\nright abruptly and vanished from my circle of interest. Then I saw the\r\nshadow of my aeroplane keeping a fixed distance before me and very\r\nsteady, and the turf as it seemed streaming out behind it. The turf!—it\r\nwasn’t after all streaming so impossibly fast.\r\n\r\nWhen I came gliding down to the safe spread of level green I had\r\nchosen, I was as cool and ready as a city clerk who drops off an\r\nomnibus in motion, and I had learnt much more than soaring. I tilted up\r\nher nose at the right moment, levelled again and grounded like a\r\nsnowflake on a windless day. I lay flat for an instant and then knelt\r\nup and got on my feet atremble, but very satisfied with myself. Cothope\r\nwas running down the hill to me. ...\r\n\r\nBut from that day I went into training, and I kept myself in training\r\nfor many months. I had delayed my experiments for very nearly six weeks\r\non various excuses because of my dread of this first flight, because of\r\nthe slackness of body and spirit that had come to me with the business\r\nlife. The shame of that cowardice spurred me none the less because it\r\nwas probably altogether my own secret. I felt that Cothope at any rate\r\nmight suspect. Well,—he shouldn’t suspect again.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that I remember that shame and self accusation and its\r\nconsequences far more distinctly than I recall the weeks of vacillation\r\nbefore I soared. For a time I went altogether without alcohol, I\r\nstopped smoking altogether and ate very sparingly, and every day I did\r\nsomething that called a little upon my nerves and muscles. I soared as\r\nfrequently as I could. I substituted a motor-bicycle for the London\r\ntrain and took my chances in the southward traffic, and I even tried\r\nwhat thrills were to be got upon a horse. But they put me on made\r\nhorses, and I conceived a perhaps unworthy contempt for the certitudes\r\nof equestrian exercise in comparison with the adventures of mechanism.\r\nAlso I walked along the high wall at the back of Lady Grove garden, and\r\nat last brought myself to stride the gap where the gate comes. If I\r\ndidn’t altogether get rid of a certain giddy instinct by such\r\nexercises, at least I trained my will until it didn’t matter. And soon\r\nI no longer dreaded flight, but was eager to go higher into the air,\r\nand I came to esteem soaring upon a glider, that even over the deepest\r\ndip in the ground had barely forty feet of fall beneath it, a mere\r\nmockery of what flight might be. I began to dream of the keener\r\nfreshness in the air high above the beechwoods, and it was rather to\r\nsatisfy that desire than as any legitimate development of my proper\r\nwork that presently I turned a part of my energies and the bulk of my\r\nprivate income to the problem of the navigable balloon.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI had gone far beyond that initial stage; I had had two smashes and a\r\nbroken rib which my aunt nursed with great energy, and was getting some\r\nreputation in the aeronautic world when, suddenly, as though she had\r\nnever really left it, the Honourable Beatrice Normandy, dark-eyed, and\r\nwith the old disorderly wave of the hair from her brow, came back into\r\nmy life. She came riding down a grass path in the thickets below Lady\r\nGrove, perched up on a huge black horse, and the old Earl of Carnaby\r\nand Archie Garvell, her half-brother, were with her. My uncle had been\r\nbothering me about the Crest Hill hot-water pipes, and we were\r\nreturning by a path transverse to theirs and came out upon them\r\nsuddenly. Old Carnaby was trespassing on our ground, and so he hailed\r\nus in a friendly fashion and pulled up to talk to us.\r\n\r\nI didn’t note Beatrice at all at first. I was interested in Lord\r\nCarnaby, that remarkable vestige of his own brilliant youth. I had\r\nheard of him, but never seen him. For a man of sixty-five who had\r\nsinned all the sins, so they said, and laid waste the most magnificent\r\npolitical debut of any man of his generation, he seemed to me to be\r\nlooking remarkably fit and fresh. He was a lean little man with\r\ngrey-blue eyes in his brown face, and his cracked voice was the worst\r\nthing in his effect.\r\n\r\n“Hope you don’t mind us coming this way, Ponderevo,” he cried; and my\r\nuncle, who was sometimes a little too general and generous with titles,\r\nanswered, “Not at all, my lord, not at all! Glad you make use of it!”\r\n\r\n“You’re building a great place over the hill,” said Carnaby.\r\n\r\n“Thought I’d make a show for once,” said my uncle. “It looks big\r\nbecause it’s spread out for the sun.”\r\n\r\n“Air and sunlight,” said the earl. “You can’t have too much of them.\r\nBut before our time they used to build for shelter and water and the\r\nhigh road.”\r\n\r\nThen I discovered that the silent figure behind the earl was Beatrice.\r\n\r\nI’d forgotten her sufficiently to think for a moment that she hadn’t\r\nchanged at all since she had watched me from behind the skirts of Lady\r\nDrew. She was looking at me, and her dainty brow under her broad\r\nbrimmed hat—she was wearing a grey hat and loose unbuttoned coat—was\r\nknit with perplexity, trying, I suppose, to remember where she had seen\r\nme before. Her shaded eyes met mine with that mute question....\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible to me she didn’t remember.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the earl and touched his horse.\r\n\r\nGarvell was patting the neck of his horse, which was inclined to\r\nfidget, and disregarding me. He nodded over his shoulder and followed.\r\nHis movement seemed to release a train of memories in her. She glanced\r\nsuddenly at him and then back at me with a flash of recognition that\r\nwarmed instantly to a faint smile. She hesitated as if to speak to me,\r\nsmiled broadly and understandingly and turned to follow the others. All\r\nthree broke into a canter and she did not look back. I stood for a\r\nsecond or so at the crossing of the lanes, watching her recede, and\r\nthen became aware that my uncle was already some paces off and talking\r\nover his shoulder in the belief that I was close behind. I turned about\r\nand strode to overtake him. My mind was full of Beatrice and this\r\nsurprise. I remembered her simply as a Normandy. I’d clean forgotten\r\nthat Garvell was the son and she the step-daughter of our neighbour,\r\nLady Osprey. Indeed, I’d probably forgotten at that time that we had\r\nLady Osprey as a neighbour. There was no reason at all for remembering\r\nit. It was amazing to find her in this Surrey countryside, when I’d\r\nnever thought of her as living anywhere in the world but at Bladesover\r\nPark, near forty miles and twenty years away. She was so alive—so\r\nunchanged! The same quick warm blood was in her cheeks. It seemed only\r\nyesterday that we had kissed among the bracken stems....\r\n\r\n“Eh?” I said.\r\n\r\n“I say he’s good stuff,” said my uncle. “You can say what you like\r\nagainst the aristocracy, George; Lord Carnaby’s rattling good stuff.\r\nThere’s a sort of _Savoir Faire_, something—it’s an old-fashioned\r\nphrase, George, but a good one there’s a Bong-Tong.... It’s like the\r\nOxford turf, George, you can’t grow it in a year. I wonder how they do\r\nit. It’s living always on a Scale, George. It’s being there from the\r\nbeginning.”...\r\n\r\n“She might,” I said to myself, “be a picture by Romney come alive!”\r\n\r\n“They tell all these stories about him,” said my uncle, “but what do\r\nthey all amount to?”\r\n\r\n“Gods!” I said to myself; “but why have I forgotten for so long? Those\r\nqueer little brows of hers, the touch of mischief in her eyes—the way\r\nshe breaks into a smile!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t blame him,” said my uncle. “Mostly it’s imagination. That and\r\nleisure, George. When I was a young man I was kept pretty busy. So were\r\nyou. Even then—!”\r\n\r\nWhat puzzled me more particularly was the queer trick of my memory that\r\nhad never recalled anything vital of Beatrice whatever when I met\r\nGarvell again that had, indeed, recalled nothing except a boyish\r\nantagonism and our fight. Now when my senses were full of her, it\r\nseemed incredible that I could ever have forgotten....\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n“Oh, Crikey!” said my aunt, reading a letter behind her coffee-machine.\r\n“_Here’s_ a young woman, George!”\r\n\r\nWe were breakfasting together in the big window bay at Lady Grove that\r\nlooks upon the iris beds; my uncle was in London.\r\n\r\nI sounded an interrogative note and decapitated an egg.\r\n\r\n“Who’s Beatrice Normandy?” asked my aunt. “I’ve not heard of her\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“She the young woman?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Says she knows you. I’m no hand at old etiquette, George, but her\r\nline is a bit unusual. Practically she says she’s going to make her\r\nmother—”\r\n\r\n“Eh? Step-mother, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“You seem to know a lot about her. She says ‘mother’—Lady Osprey.\r\nThey’re to call on me, anyhow, next Wednesday week at four, and there’s\r\ngot to be you for tea.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“You—for tea.\r\n\r\n“H’m. She had rather—force of character. When I knew her before.”\r\n\r\nI became aware of my aunt’s head sticking out obliquely from behind the\r\ncoffee-machine and regarding me with wide blue curiosity. I met her\r\ngaze for a moment, flinched, coloured, and laughed.\r\n\r\n“I’ve known her longer than I’ve known you,” I said, and explained at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nMy aunt kept her eye on me over and round the coffee-machine as I did\r\nso. She was greatly interested, and asked several elucidatory\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you tell me the day you saw her? You’ve had her on your\r\nmind for a week,” she said.\r\n\r\n“It IS odd I didn’t tell you,” I admitted.\r\n\r\n“You thought I’d get a Down on her,” said my aunt conclusively. “That’s\r\nwhat you thought” and opened the rest of her letters.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies came in a pony-carriage with conspicuous punctuality,\r\nand I had the unusual experience of seeing my aunt entertaining\r\ncallers. We had tea upon the terrace under the cedar, but old Lady\r\nOsprey, being an embittered Protestant, had never before seen the\r\ninside of the house, and we made a sort of tour of inspection that\r\nreminded me of my first visit to the place. In spite of my\r\npreoccupation with Beatrice, I stored a queer little memory of the\r\ncontrast between the two other women; my aunt, tall, slender and\r\nawkward, in a simple blue homekeeping dress, an omnivorous reader and a\r\nvery authentic wit, and the lady of pedigree, short and plump, dressed\r\nwith Victorian fussiness, living at the intellectual level of palmistry\r\nand genteel fiction, pink in the face and generally flustered by a\r\nsense of my aunt’s social strangeness and disposed under the\r\ncircumstances to behave rather like an imitation of the more queenly\r\nmoments of her own cook. The one seemed made of whalebone, the other of\r\ndough. My aunt was nervous, partly through the intrinsic difficulty of\r\nhandling the lady and partly because of her passionate desire to watch\r\nBeatrice and me, and her nervousness took a common form with her, a\r\nwider clumsiness of gesture and an exacerbation of her habitual oddity\r\nof phrase which did much to deepen the pink perplexity of the lady of\r\ntitle. For instance, I heard my aunt admit that one of the Stuart\r\nDurgan ladies did look a bit “balmy on the crumpet”; she described the\r\nknights of the age of chivalry as “korvorting about on the off-chance\r\nof a dragon”; she explained she was “always old mucking about the\r\ngarden,” and instead of offering me a Garibaldi biscuit, she asked me\r\nwith that faint lisp of hers, to “have some squashed flies, George.” I\r\nfelt convinced Lady Osprey would describe her as “a most eccentric\r\nperson” on the very first opportunity;—“a most eccentric person.” One\r\ncould see her, as people say, “shaping” for that.\r\n\r\nBeatrice was dressed very quietly in brown, with a simple but\r\ncourageous broad-brimmed hat, and an unexpected quality of being\r\ngrown-up and responsible. She guided her step-mother through the first\r\nencounter, scrutinised my aunt, and got us all well in movement through\r\nthe house, and then she turned her attention to me with a quick and\r\nhalf-confident smile.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t met,” she said, “since—”\r\n\r\n“It was in the Warren.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she said, “the Warren! I remembered it all except just the\r\nname.... I was eight.”\r\n\r\nHer smiling eyes insisted on my memories being thorough. I looked up\r\nand met them squarely, a little at a loss for what I should say.\r\n\r\n“I gave you away pretty completely,” she said, meditating upon my face.\r\n“And afterwards I gave way Archie.”\r\n\r\nShe turned her face away from the others, and her voice fell ever so\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n“They gave him a licking for telling lies!” she said, as though that\r\nwas a pleasant memory. “And when it was all over I went to our wigwam.\r\nYou remember the wigwam?”\r\n\r\n“Out in the West Wood?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—and cried—for all the evil I had done you, I suppose.... I’ve\r\noften thought of it since.”...\r\n\r\nLady Osprey stopped for us to overtake her. “My dear!” she said to\r\nBeatrice. “Such a beautiful gallery!” Then she stared very hard at me,\r\npuzzled in the most naked fashion to understand who I might be.\r\n\r\n“People say the oak staircase is rather good,” said my aunt, and led\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nLady Osprey, with her skirts gathered for the ascent to the gallery and\r\nher hand on the newel, turned and addressed a look full of meaning\r\noverflowing indeed with meanings—at her charge. The chief meaning no\r\ndoubt was caution about myself, but much of it was just meaning at\r\nlarge. I chanced to catch the response in a mirror and detected\r\nBeatrice with her nose wrinkled into a swift and entirely diabolical\r\ngrimace. Lady Osprey became a deeper shade of pink and speechless with\r\nindignation—it was evident she disavowed all further responsibility, as\r\nshe followed my aunt upstairs.\r\n\r\n“It’s dark, but there’s a sort of dignity,” said Beatrice very\r\ndistinctly, regarding the hall with serene tranquillity, and allowing\r\nthe unwilling feet on the stairs to widen their distance from us. She\r\nstood a step up, so that she looked down a little upon me and over me\r\nat the old hall.\r\n\r\nShe turned upon me abruptly when she thought her step-mother was beyond\r\near-shot.\r\n\r\n“But how did you get here?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Here?”\r\n\r\n“All this.” She indicated space and leisure by a wave of the hand at\r\nhall and tall windows and sunlit terrace. “Weren’t you the\r\nhousekeeper’s son?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve adventured. My uncle has become—a great financier. He used to be\r\na little chemist about twenty miles from Bladesover. We’re promoters\r\nnow, amalgamators, big people on the new model.”\r\n\r\n“I understand.” She regarded me with interested eyes, visibly thinking\r\nme out.\r\n\r\n“And you recognised me?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“After a second or so. I saw you recognised me. I couldn’t place you,\r\nbut I knew I knew you. Then Archie being there helped me to remember.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to meet again,” I ventured. “I’d never forgotten you.”\r\n\r\n“One doesn’t forget those childish things.”\r\n\r\nWe regarded one another for a moment with a curiously easy and\r\nconfident satisfaction in coming together again. I can’t explain our\r\nready zest in one another. The thing was so. We pleased each other, we\r\nhad no doubt in our minds that we pleased each other. From the first we\r\nwere at our ease with one another. “So picturesque, so very\r\npicturesque,” came a voice from above, and then: “Bee-atrice!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve a hundred things I want to know about you,” she said with an easy\r\nintimacy, as we went up the winding steps....\r\n\r\nAs the four of us sat at tea together under the cedar on the terrace\r\nshe asked questions about my aeronautics. My aunt helped with a word or\r\nso about my broken ribs. Lady Osprey evidently regarded flying as a\r\nmost indesirable and improper topic—a blasphemous intrusion upon the\r\nangels. “It isn’t flying,” I explained. “We don’t fly yet.”\r\n\r\n“You never will,” she said compactly. “You never will.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “we do what we can.”\r\n\r\nThe little lady lifted a small gloved hand and indicated a height of\r\nabout four feet from the ground. “Thus far,” she said, “thus far—_and\r\nno farther!_ No!”\r\n\r\nShe became emphatically pink. “_No_,” she said again quite\r\nconclusively, and coughed shortly. “Thank you,” she said to her ninth\r\nor tenth cake. Beatrice burst into cheerful laughter with her eye on\r\nme. I was lying on the turf, and this perhaps caused a slight confusion\r\nabout the primordial curse in Lady Osprey’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Upon his belly shall he go,” she said with quiet distinctness, “all\r\nthe days of his life.”\r\n\r\nAfter which we talked no more of aeronautics.\r\n\r\nBeatrice sat bunched together in a chair and regarded me with exactly\r\nthe same scrutiny, I thought, the same adventurous aggression, that I\r\nhad faced long ago at the tea-table in my mother’s room. She was\r\namazingly like that little Princess of my Bladesover memories, the\r\nwilful misbehaviours of her hair seemed the same—her voice; things one\r\nwould have expected to be changed altogether. She formed her plans in\r\nthe same quick way, and acted with the same irresponsible decision.\r\n\r\nShe stood up abruptly.\r\n\r\n“What is there beyond the terrace?” she said, and found me promptly\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nI invented a view for her.\r\n\r\nAt the further corner from the cedar she perched herself up upon the\r\nparapet and achieved an air of comfort among the lichenous stones. “Now\r\ntell me,” she said, “all about yourself. Tell me about yourself; I know\r\nsuch duffers of men! They all do the same things. How did you get—here?\r\nAll my men _were_ here. They couldn’t have got here if they hadn’t been\r\nhere always. They wouldn’t have thought it right. You’ve climbed.”\r\n\r\n“If it’s climbing,” I said.\r\n\r\nShe went off at a tangent. “It’s—I don’t know if you’ll\r\nunderstand—interesting to meet you again. I’ve remembered you. I don’t\r\nknow why, but I have. I’ve used you as a sort of lay figure—when I’ve\r\ntold myself stories. But you’ve always been rather stiff and difficult\r\nin my stories—in ready-made clothes—a Labour Member or a Bradlaugh, or\r\nsomething like that. You’re not like that a bit. And yet you _are!_”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me. “Was it much of a fight? They make out it is.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why.”\r\n\r\n“I was shot up here by an accident,” I said. “There was no fight at\r\nall. Except to keep honest, perhaps and I made no great figure in that.\r\nI and my uncle mixed a medicine and it blew us up. No merit in that!\r\nBut you’ve been here all the time. Tell me what you have done first.”\r\n\r\n“One thing we didn’t do.” She meditated for a moment.\r\n\r\n“What?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Produce a little half-brother for Bladesover. So it went to the\r\nPhillbrick gang. And they let it! And I and my step-mother—we let, too.\r\nAnd live in a little house.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head vaguely over her shoulder and turned to me again.\r\n“Well, suppose it was an accident. Here you are! Now you’re here, what\r\nare you going to do? You’re young. Is it to be Parliament? heard some\r\nmen the other day talking about you. Before I knew you were you. They\r\nsaid that was what you ought to do.”...\r\n\r\nShe put me through my intentions with a close and vital curiosity. It\r\nwas just as she had tried to imagine me a soldier and place me years\r\nago. She made me feel more planless and incidental than ever. “You want\r\nto make a flying-machine,” she pursued, “and when you fly? What then?\r\nWould it be for fighting?”\r\n\r\nI told her something of my experimental work. She had never heard of\r\nthe soaring aeroplane, and was excited by the thought, and keen to hear\r\nabout it. She had thought all the work so far had been a mere\r\nprojecting of impossible machines. For her Pilcher and Lilienthal had\r\ndied in vain. She did not know such men had lived in the world.\r\n\r\n“But that’s dangerous!” she said, with a note of discovery.\r\n\r\n“Oh!—it’s dangerous.”\r\n\r\n“Bee-atrice!” Lady Osprey called.\r\n\r\nBeatrice dropped from the wall to her feet.\r\n\r\n“Where do you do this soaring?”\r\n\r\n“Beyond the high Barrows. East of Crest Hill and the wood.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mind people coming to see?”\r\n\r\n“Whenever you please. Only let me know”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take my chance some day. Some day soon.” She looked at me\r\nthoughtfully, smiled, and our talk was at an end.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAll my later work in aeronautics is associated in my memory with the\r\nquality of Beatrice, with her incidental presence, with things she said\r\nand did and things I thought of that had reference to her.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of that year I had got to a flying machine that lacked\r\nnothing but longitudinal stability. My model flew like a bird for fifty\r\nor a hundred yards or so, and then either dived and broke its nose or,\r\nwhat was commoner, reared up, slid back and smashed its propeller. The\r\nrhythm of the pitching puzzled me. I felt it must obey some laws not\r\nyet quite clearly stated. I became therefore a student of theory and\r\nliterature for a time; I hit upon the string of considerations that led\r\nme to what is called Ponderevo’s Principle and my F.R.S., and I worked\r\nthis out in three long papers. Meanwhile I made a lot of turn-table and\r\nglider models and started in upon an idea of combining gas-bags and\r\ngliders. Balloon work was new to me. I had made one or two ascents in\r\nthe balloons of the Aëro Club before I started my gasometer and the\r\nballoon shed and gave Cothope a couple of months with Sir Peter\r\nRumchase. My uncle found part of the money for these developments; he\r\nwas growing interested and competitive in this business because of Lord\r\nBoom’s prize and the amount of _réclame_ involved, and it was at his\r\nrequest that I named my first navigable balloon Lord Roberts Alpha.\r\n\r\nLord Roberts A very nearly terminated all my investigations. My idea\r\nboth in this and its more successful and famous younger brother, Lord\r\nRoberts β, was to utilise the idea of a contractile balloon with a\r\nrigid flat base, a balloon shaped rather like an inverted boat that\r\nshould almost support the apparatus, but not quite. The gas-bag was of\r\nthe chambered sort used for these long forms, and not with an internal\r\nballoonette. The trouble was to make the thing contractile. This I\r\nsought to do by fixing a long, fine-meshed silk net over it that was\r\nfastened to be rolled up on two longitudinal rods. Practically I\r\ncontracted my sausage gas-bag by netting it down. The ends were too\r\ncomplex for me to describe here, but I thought them out elaborately and\r\nthey were very carefully planned. Lord Roberts A was furnished with a\r\nsingle big screw forward, and there was a rudder aft. The engine was\r\nthe first one to be, so to speak, right in the plane of the gas-bag. I\r\nlay immediately under the balloon on a sort of glider framework, far\r\naway from either engine or rudder, controlling them by wire-pulls\r\nconstructed on the principle of the well-known Bowden brake of the\r\ncyclist.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Roberts A has been pretty exhaustively figured and described\r\nin various aeronautical publications. The unforeseen defect was the\r\nbadness of the work in the silk netting. It tore aft as soon as I began\r\nto contract the balloon, and the last two segments immediately bulged\r\nthrough the hole, exactly as an inner tube will bulge through the\r\nruptured outer cover of a pneumatic tire, and then the sharp edge of\r\nthe torn net cut the oiled-silk of the distended last segment along a\r\nweak seam and burst it with a loud report.\r\n\r\nUp to that point the whole thing had been going on extremely well. As a\r\nnavigable balloon and before I contracted it, the Lord Roberts A was an\r\nunqualified success. It had run out of the shed admirably at nine or\r\nten miles an hour or more, and although there was a gentle southwester\r\nblowing, it had gone up and turned and faced it as well as any craft of\r\nthe sort I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nI lay in my customary glider position, horizontal and face downward,\r\nand the invisibility of all the machinery gave an extraordinary effect\r\nof independent levitation. Only by looking up, as it were, and turning\r\nmy head back could I see the flat aeroplane bottom of the balloon and\r\nthe rapid successive passages, swish, swish, swish of the vans of the\r\npropeller. I made a wide circle over Lady Grove and Duffield and out\r\ntowards Effingham and came back quite successfully to the\r\nstarting-point.\r\n\r\nDown below in the October sunlight were my sheds and the little group\r\nthat had been summoned to witness the start, their faces craned upward\r\nand most of them scrutinising my expression through field-glasses. I\r\ncould see Carnaby and Beatrice on horseback, and two girls I did not\r\nknow with them; Cothope and three or four workmen I employed; my aunt\r\nand Mrs. Levinstein, who was staying with her, on foot, and Dimmock,\r\nthe veterinary surgeon, and one or two others. My shadow moved a little\r\nto the north of them like the shadow of a fish. At Lady Grove the\r\nservants were out on the lawn, and the Duffield school playground\r\nswarmed with children too indifferent to aeronautics to cease their\r\nplaying. But in the Crest Hill direction—the place looked\r\nextraordinarily squat and ugly from above—there were knots and strings\r\nof staring workmen everywhere—not one of them working, but all agape.\r\n(But now I write it, it occurs to me that perhaps it was their dinner\r\nhour; it was certainly near twelve.) I hung for a moment or so enjoying\r\nthe soar, then turned about to face a clear stretch of open down, let\r\nthe engine out to full speed and set my rollers at work rolling in the\r\nnet, and so tightening the gas-bags. Instantly the pace quickened with\r\nthe diminished resistance...\r\n\r\nIn that moment before the bang I think I must have been really flying.\r\nBefore the net ripped, just in the instant when my balloon was at its\r\nsystole, the whole apparatus was, I am convinced, heavier than air.\r\nThat, however, is a claim that has been disputed, and in any case this\r\nsort of priority is a very trivial thing.\r\n\r\nThen came a sudden retardation, instantly followed by an inexpressibly\r\ndisconcerting tilt downward of the machine. That I still recall with\r\nhorror. I couldn’t see what was happening at all and I couldn’t\r\nimagine. It was a mysterious, inexplicable dive. The thing, it seemed,\r\nwithout rhyme or reason, was kicking up its heels in the air. The bang\r\nfollowed immediately, and I perceived I was falling rapidly.\r\n\r\nI was too much taken by surprise to think of the proper cause of the\r\nreport. I don’t even know what I made of it. I was obsessed, I suppose,\r\nby that perpetual dread of the modern aeronaut, a flash between engine\r\nand balloon. Yet obviously I wasn’t wrapped in flames. I ought to have\r\nrealised instantly it wasn’t that. I did, at any rate, whatever other\r\nimpressions there were, release the winding of the outer net and let\r\nthe balloon expand again, and that no doubt did something to break my\r\nfall. I don’t remember doing that. Indeed, all I do remember is the\r\ngiddy effect upon the landscape of falling swiftly upon it down a flat\r\nspiral, the hurried rush of fields and trees and cottages on my left\r\nshoulder and the overhung feeling as if the whole apparatus was\r\npressing down the top of my head. I didn’t stop or attempt to stop the\r\nscrew. That was going on, swish, swish, swish all the time.\r\n\r\nCothope really knows more about the fall than I do. He describes the\r\neasterly start, the tilt, and the appearance and bursting of a sort of\r\nbladder aft. Then down I swooped, very swiftly, but not nearly so\r\nsteeply as I imagined I was doing. “Fifteen or twenty degrees,” said\r\nCothope, “to be exact.” From him it was that I learnt that I let the\r\nnets loose again, and so arrested my fall. He thinks I was more in\r\ncontrol of myself than I remember.\r\n\r\nBut I do not see why I should have forgotten so excellent a resolution.\r\nHis impression is that I was really steering and trying to drop into\r\nthe Farthing Down beeches. “You hit the trees,” he said, “and the whole\r\naffair stood on its nose among them, and then very slowly crumpled up.\r\nI saw you’d been jerked out, as I thought, and I didn’t stay for more.\r\nI rushed for my bicycle.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it was purely accidental that I came down in the\r\nwoods. I am reasonably certain that I had no more control then than a\r\nthing in a parcel. I remember I felt a sort of wincing, “Now it comes!”\r\nas the trees rushed up to me. If I remember that, I should remember\r\nsteering. Then the propeller smashed, everything stopped with a jerk,\r\nand I was falling into a mass of yellowing leaves, and Lord Roberts A,\r\nso it seemed to me, was going back into the sky.\r\n\r\nI felt twigs and things hit me in the face, but I didn’t feel injured\r\nat the time; I clutched at things that broke, tumbled through a froth\r\nof green and yellow into a shadowy world of great bark-covered arms,\r\nand there, snatching wildly, got a grip on a fair round branch, and\r\nhung.\r\n\r\nI became intensely alert and clear-headed. I held by that branch for a\r\nmoment and then looked about me, and caught at another, and then found\r\nmyself holding to a practicable fork. I swung forward to that and got a\r\nleg around it below its junction, and so was able presently to clamber\r\ndown, climbing very coolly and deliberately. I dropped ten feet or so\r\nfrom the lowest branch and fell on my feet. “That’s all right,” I said,\r\nand stared up through the tree to see what I could of the deflated and\r\ncrumpled remains that had once been Lord Roberts A festooned on the\r\nbranches it had broken. “Gods!” I said, “what a tumble!”\r\n\r\nI wiped something that trickled from my face and was shocked to see my\r\nhand covered with blood. I looked at myself and saw what seemed to me\r\nan astonishing quantity of blood running down my arm and shoulder. I\r\nperceived my mouth was full of blood. It’s a queer moment when one\r\nrealises one is hurt, and perhaps badly hurt, and has still to discover\r\njust how far one is hurt. I explored my face carefully and found\r\nunfamiliar contours on the left side. The broken end of a branch had\r\ndriven right through my cheek, damaging my cheek and teeth and gums,\r\nand left a splinter of itself stuck, like an explorer’s\r\nfartherest-point flag, in the upper maxillary. That and a sprained\r\nwrist were all my damage. But I bled as though I had been chopped to\r\npieces, and it seemed to me that my face had been driven in. I can’t\r\ndescribe just the horrible disgust I felt at that.\r\n\r\n“This blood must be stopped, anyhow,” I said, thickheadedly.\r\n\r\n“I wonder where there’s a spider’s web”—an odd twist for my mind to\r\ntake. But it was the only treatment that occurred to me.\r\n\r\nI must have conceived some idea of going home unaided, because I was\r\nthirty yards from the tree before I dropped.\r\n\r\nThen a kind of black disc appeared in the middle of the world and\r\nrushed out to the edge of things and blotted them out. I don’t remember\r\nfalling down. I fainted from excitement, disgust at my injury and loss\r\nof blood, and lay there until Cothope found me.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to find me, scorching as he did over the downland\r\nturf, and making a wide course to get the Carnaby plantations at their\r\nnarrowest. Then presently, while he was trying to apply the methodical\r\nteachings of the St. John’s Ambulance classes to a rather abnormal\r\ncase, Beatrice came galloping through the trees full-tilt, with Lord\r\nCarnaby hard behind her, and she was hatless, muddy from a fall, and\r\nwhite as death. “And cool as a cucumber, too,” said Cothope, turning it\r\nover in his mind as he told me.\r\n\r\n(“They never seem quite to have their heads, and never seem quite to\r\nlose ’em,” said Cothope, generalising about the sex.)\r\n\r\nAlso he witnessed she acted with remarkable decision. The question was\r\nwhether I should be taken to the house her step-mother occupied at\r\nBedley Corner, the Carnaby dower house, or down to Carnaby’s place at\r\nEasting. Beatrice had no doubt in the matter, for she meant to nurse\r\nme. Carnaby didn’t seem to want that to happen. “She _would_ have it\r\nwasn’t half so far,” said Cothope. “She faced us out....\r\n\r\n“I hate to be faced out of my opinion, so I’ve taken a pedometer over\r\nit since. It’s exactly forty-three yards further.\r\n\r\n“Lord Carnaby looked at her pretty straight,” said Cothope, finishing\r\nthe picture; “and then he give in.”\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBut my story has made a jump from June to October, and during that time\r\nmy relations with Beatrice and the countryside that was her setting had\r\ndeveloped in many directions. She came and went, moving in an orbit for\r\nwhich I had no data, going to London and Paris, into Wales and\r\nNorthampton, while her stepmother, on some independent system of her\r\nown, also vanished and recurred intermittently. At home they obeyed the\r\nrule of an inflexible old maid, Charlotte, and Beatrice exercised all\r\nthe rights of proprietorship in Carnaby’s extensive stables. Her\r\ninterest in me was from the first undisguised. She found her way to my\r\nworksheds and developed rapidly, in spite of the sincere discouragement\r\nof Cothope, into a keen amateur of aeronautics. She would come\r\nsometimes in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes afoot\r\nwith an Irish terrier, sometimes riding. She would come for three or\r\nfour days every day, vanish for a fortnight or three weeks, return.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before I came to look for her. From the first I found\r\nher immensely interesting. To me she was a new feminine type\r\naltogether—I have made it plain, I think, how limited was my knowledge\r\nof women. But she made me not simply interested in her, but in myself.\r\nShe became for me something that greatly changes a man’s world. How\r\nshall I put it? She became an audience. Since I’ve emerged from the\r\nemotional developments of the affair I have thought it out in a hundred\r\naspects, and it does seem to me that this way in which men and women\r\nmake audiences for one another is a curiously influential force in\r\ntheir lives. For some it seems an audience is a vital necessity, they\r\nseek audiences as creatures seek food; others again, my uncle among\r\nthem, can play to an imaginary audience. I, I think, have lived and can\r\nlive without one. In my adolescence I was my own audience and my own\r\ncourt of honour. And to have an audience in one’s mind is to play a\r\npart, to become self-conscious and dramatic. For many years I had been\r\nself-forgetful and scientific. I had lived for work and impersonal\r\ninterests until I found scrutiny, applause and expectation in\r\nBeatrice’s eyes. Then I began to live for the effect I imagined I made\r\nupon her, to make that very soon the principal value in my life. I\r\nplayed to her. I did things for the look of them. I began to dream more\r\nand more of beautiful situations and fine poses and groupings with her\r\nand for her.\r\n\r\nI put these things down because they puzzle me. I think I was in love\r\nwith Beatrice, as being in love is usually understood; but it was quite\r\na different state altogether from my passionate hunger for Marion, or\r\nmy keen, sensuous desire for and pleasure in Effie. These were selfish,\r\nsincere things, fundamental and instinctive, as sincere as the leap of\r\na tiger. But until matters drew to a crisis with Beatrice, there was an\r\nimmense imaginative insurgence of a quite different quality. I am\r\nsetting down here very gravely, and perhaps absurdly, what are no doubt\r\nelementary commonplaces for innumerable people. This love that grew up\r\nbetween Beatrice and myself was, I think—I put it quite tentatively and\r\nrather curiously—romantic love. That unfortunate and truncated affair\r\nof my uncle and the Scrymgeour lady was really of the same stuff, if a\r\nlittle different in quality. I have to admit that. The factor of\r\naudience was of primary importance in either else.\r\n\r\nIts effect upon me was to make me in many respects adolescent again. It\r\nmade me keener upon the point of honour, and anxious and eager to do\r\nhigh and splendid things, and in particular, brave things. So far it\r\nennobled and upheld me. But it did also push me towards vulgar and\r\nshowy things. At bottom it was disingenuous; it gave my life the\r\nquality of stage scenery, with one side to the audience, another side\r\nthat wasn’t meant to show, and an economy of substance. It certainly\r\nrobbed my work of high patience and quality. I cut down the toil of\r\nresearch in my eagerness and her eagerness for fine flourishes in the\r\nair, flights that would tell. I shirked the longer road.\r\n\r\nAnd it robbed me, too, of any fine perception of absurdity.\r\n\r\nYet that was not everything in our relationship. The elemental thing\r\nwas there also. It came in very suddenly.\r\n\r\nIt was one day in the summer, though I do not now recall without\r\nreference to my experimental memoranda whether it was in July or\r\nAugust. I was working with a new and more bird-like aeroplane with wing\r\ncurvatures studied from Lilienthal, Pilcher and Phillips, that I\r\nthought would give a different rhythm for the pitching oscillations\r\nthan anything I’d had before. I was soaring my long course from the\r\nframework on the old barrow by my sheds down to Tinker’s Corner. It is\r\na clear stretch of downland, except for two or three thickets of box\r\nand thorn to the right of my course; one transverse trough, in which\r\nthere is bush and a small rabbit warren, comes in from the east. I had\r\nstarted, and was very intent on the peculiar long swoop with which any\r\nnew arrangement flew. Then, without any sort of notice, right ahead of\r\nme appeared Beatrice, riding towards Tinker’s Corner to waylay and talk\r\nto me. She looked round over her shoulder, saw me coming, touched her\r\nhorse to a gallop, and then the brute bolted right into the path of my\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThere was a queer moment of doubt whether we shouldn’t all smash\r\ntogether. I had to make up my mind very quickly whether I would\r\npitch-up and drop backward at once and take my chance of falling\r\nundamaged—a poor chance it would have been—in order to avoid any risk\r\nto her, or whether I would lift against the wind and soar right over\r\nher. This latter I did. She had already got her horse in hand when I\r\ncame up to her. Her woman’s body lay along his neck, and she glanced up\r\nas I, with wings aspread, and every nerve in a state of tension, swept\r\nover her.\r\n\r\nThen I had landed, and was going back to where her horse stood still\r\nand trembling.\r\n\r\nWe exchanged no greetings. She slid from her saddle into my arms, and\r\nfor one instant I held her.\r\n\r\n“Those great wings,” she said, and that was all.\r\n\r\nShe lay in my arms, and I thought for a moment she had fainted.\r\n\r\n“Very near a nasty accident,” said Cothope, coming up and regarding our\r\ngrouping with disfavour. He took her horse by the bridle. “Very\r\ndangerous thing coming across us like that.”\r\n\r\nBeatrice disengaged herself from me, stood for a moment trembling, and\r\nthen sat down on the turf “I’ll just sit down for a moment,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said.\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with her hands, while Cothope looked at her with\r\nan expression between suspicion and impatience.\r\n\r\nFor some moments nobody moved. Then Cothope remarked that perhaps he’d\r\nbetter get her water.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I was filled with a new outrageous idea, begotten I scarcely\r\nknow how from this incident, with its instant contacts and swift\r\nemotions, and that was that I must make love to and possess Beatrice. I\r\nsee no particular reason why that thought should have come to me in\r\nthat moment, but it did. I do not believe that before then I had\r\nthought of our relations in such terms at all. Suddenly, as I remember\r\nit, the factor of passion came. She crouched there, and I stood over\r\nher, and neither of us said a word. But it was just as though something\r\nhad been shouted from the sky.\r\n\r\nCothope had gone twenty paces perhaps when she uncovered her face. “I\r\nshan’t want any water,” she said. “Call him back.”\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAfter that the spirit of our relations changed. The old ease had gone.\r\nShe came to me less frequently, and when she came she would have some\r\none with her, usually old Carnaby, and he would do the bulk of the\r\ntalking. All through September she was away. When we were alone\r\ntogether there was a curious constraint. We became clouds of\r\ninexpressible feeling towards one another; we could think of nothing\r\nthat was not too momentous for words.\r\n\r\nThen came the smash of Lord Roberts A, and I found myself with a\r\nbandaged face in a bedroom in the Bedley Corner dower-house with\r\nBeatrice presiding over an inefficient nurse, Lady Osprey very pink and\r\nshocked in the background, and my aunt jealously intervening.\r\n\r\nMy injuries were much more showy than serious, and I could have been\r\ntaken to Lady Grove next day, but Beatrice would not permit that, and\r\nkept me at Bedley Corner three clear days. In the afternoon of the\r\nsecond day she became extremely solicitous for the proper aeration of\r\nthe nurse, packed her off for an hour in a brisk rain, and sat by me\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nI asked her to marry me.\r\n\r\nAll the whole I must admit it was not a situation that lent itself to\r\neloquence. I lay on my back and talked through bandages, and with some\r\nlittle difficulty, for my tongue and mouth had swollen. But I was\r\nfeverish and in pain, and the emotional suspense I had been in so long\r\nwith regard to her became now an unendurable impatience.\r\n\r\n“Comfortable?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I read to you?”\r\n\r\n“No. I want to talk.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t. I’d better talk to you.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “I want to talk to you.”\r\n\r\nShe came and stood by my bedside and looked me in the eyes. “I don’t—I\r\ndon’t want you to talk to me,” she said. “I thought you couldn’t talk.”\r\n\r\n“I get few chances—of you.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better not talk. Don’t talk now. Let me chatter instead. You\r\nought not to talk.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t much,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I’d rather you didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to be disfigured,” I said. “Only a scar.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said, as if she had expected something quite different. “Did\r\nyou think you’d become a sort of gargoyle?”\r\n\r\n“L’Homme qui Rit!—I didn’t know. But that’s all right. Jolly flowers\r\nthose are!”\r\n\r\n“Michaelmas daisies,” she said. “I’m glad you’r not disfigured, and\r\nthose are perennial sunflowers. Do you know no flowers at all? When I\r\nsaw you on the ground I certainly thought you were dead. You ought to\r\nhave been, by all the rules of the game.”\r\n\r\nShe said some other things, but I was thinking of my next move.\r\n\r\n“Are we social equals?” I said abruptly.\r\n\r\nShe stared at me. “Queer question,” she said.\r\n\r\n“But are we?”\r\n\r\n“H’m. Difficult to say. But why do you ask? Is the daughter of a\r\ncourtesy Baron who died—of general disreputableness, I believe—before\r\nhis father—? I give it up. Does it matter?”\r\n\r\n“No. My mind is confused. I want to know if you will marry me.”\r\n\r\nShe whitened and said nothing. I suddenly felt I must plead with her.\r\n“Damn these bandages!” I said, breaking into ineffectual febrile rage.\r\n\r\nShe roused herself to her duties as nurse. “What are you doing? Why are\r\nyou trying to sit up? Sit down! Don’t touch your bandages. I told you\r\nnot to talk.”\r\n\r\nShe stood helpless for a moment, then took me firmly by the shoulders\r\nand pushed me back upon the pillow. She gripped the wrist of the hand I\r\nhad raised to my face.\r\n\r\n“I told you not to talk,” she whispered close to my face. “I asked you\r\nnot to talk. Why couldn’t you do as I asked you?”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been avoiding me for a month,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I know. You might have known. Put your hand back—down by your side.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed. She sat on the edge of the bed. A flush had come to her\r\ncheeks, and her eyes were very bright. “I asked you,” she repeated,\r\n“not to talk.”\r\n\r\nMy eyes questioned her mutely.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on my chest. Her eyes were tormented.\r\n\r\n“How can I answer you now?” she said.\r\n\r\n“How can I say anything now?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean it must be ‘No’?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n“But” I said, and my whole soul was full of accusations.\r\n\r\n“I know,” she said. “I can’t explain. I can’t. But it has to be ‘No!’\r\nIt can’t be. It’s utterly, finally, for ever impossible.... Keep your\r\nhands still!”\r\n\r\n“But,” I said, “when we met again—”\r\n\r\n“I can’t marry. I can’t and won’t.”\r\n\r\nShe stood up. “Why did you talk?” she cried, “couldn’t you _see?_”\r\n\r\nShe seemed to have something it was impossible to say.\r\n\r\nShe came to the table beside my bed and pulled the Michaelmas daisies\r\nawry. “Why did you talk like that?” she said in a tone of infinite\r\nbitterness. “To begin like that!”\r\n\r\n“But what is it?” I said. “Is it some circumstance—my social position?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _damn_ your social position!” she cried.\r\n\r\nShe went and stood at the further window, staring out at the rain. For\r\na long time we were absolutely still. The wind and rain came in little\r\ngusts upon the pane. She turned to me abruptly.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t ask me if I loved you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if it’s _that!_” said I.\r\n\r\n“It’s not that,” she said. “But if you want to know—” She paused.\r\n\r\n“I do,” she said.\r\n\r\nWe stared at one another.\r\n\r\n“I do—with all my heart, if you want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Then, why the devil—?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer. She walked across the room to the piano and began\r\nto play, rather noisily and rapidly, with odd gusts of emphasis, the\r\nshepherd’s pipe music from the last act in “Tristan and Isolde.”\r\nPresently she missed a note, failed again, ran her finger heavily up\r\nthe scale, struck the piano passionately with her fist, making a feeble\r\njar in the treble, jumped up, and went out of the room....\r\n\r\nThe nurse found me still wearing my helmet of bandages, partially\r\ndressed, and pottering round the room to find the rest of my clothes. I\r\nwas in a state of exasperated hunger for Beatrice, and I was too\r\ninflamed and weakened to conceal the state of my mind. I was feebly\r\nangry because of the irritation of dressing, and particularly of the\r\nstruggle to put on my trousers without being able to see my legs. I was\r\nstaggering about, and once I had fallen over a chair and I had upset\r\nthe jar of Michaelmas daisies.\r\n\r\nI must have been a detestable spectacle. “I’ll go back to bed,” said I,\r\n“if I may have a word with Miss Beatrice. I’ve got something to say to\r\nher. That’s why I’m dressing.”\r\n\r\nMy point was conceded, but there were long delays. Whether the\r\nhousehold had my ultimatum or whether she told Beatrice directly I do\r\nnot know, and what Lady Osprey can have made of it in the former case I\r\ndon’t imagine.\r\n\r\nAt last Beatrice came and stood by my bedside. “Well?” she said.\r\n\r\n“All I want to say,” I said with the querulous note of a misunderstood\r\nchild, “is that I can’t take this as final. I want to see you and talk\r\nwhen I’m better, and write. I can’t do anything now. I can’t argue.”\r\n\r\nI was overtaken with self-pity and began to snivel, “I can’t rest. You\r\nsee? I can’t do anything.”\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside me again and spoke softly. “I promise I will talk\r\nit all over with you again. When you are well. I promise I will meet\r\nyou somewhere so that we can talk. You can’t talk now.\r\n\r\n“I asked you not to talk now. All you want to know you shall know...\r\nWill that do?”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to know”\r\n\r\nShe looked round to see the door was closed, stood up and went to it.\r\n\r\nThen she crouched beside me and began whispering very softly and\r\nrapidly with her face close to me.\r\n\r\n“Dear,” she said, “I love you. If it will make you happy to marry me, I\r\nwill marry you. I was in a mood just now—a stupid, inconsiderate mood.\r\nOf course I will marry you. You are my prince, my king. Women are such\r\nthings of mood—or I would have behaved differently. We say ‘No’ when we\r\nmean ‘Yes’—and fly into crises. So now, Yes—yes—yes. I will. I can’t\r\neven kiss you. Give me your hand to kiss that. Understand, I am yours.\r\nDo you understand? I am yours just as if we had been married fifty\r\nyears. Your wife—Beatrice. Is that enough? Now—now will you rest?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “but why?”\r\n\r\n“There are complications. There are difficulties. When you are better\r\nyou will be able to—understand them. But now they don’t matter. Only\r\nyou know this must be secret—for a time. Absolutely secret between us.\r\nWill you promise that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “I understand. I wish I could kiss you.”\r\n\r\nShe laid her head down beside mine for a moment and then she kissed my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what difficulties there are,” I said, and I shut my eyes.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nBut I was only beginning to gauge the unaccountable elements in\r\nBeatrice. For a week after my return to Lady Grove I had no sign of\r\nher, and then she called with Lady Osprey and brought a huge bunch of\r\nperennial sunflowers and Michaelmas daisies, “just the old flowers\r\nthere were in your room,” said my aunt, with a relentless eye on me. I\r\ndidn’t get any talk alone with Beatrice then, and she took occasion to\r\ntell us she was going to London for some indefinite number of weeks. I\r\ncouldn’t even pledge her to write to me, and when she did it was a\r\nbrief, enigmatical, friendly letter with not a word of the reality\r\nbetween us.\r\n\r\nI wrote back a love letter—my first love letter—and she made no reply\r\nfor eight days. Then came a scrawl: “I can’t write letters. Wait till\r\nwe can talk. Are you better?”\r\n\r\nI think the reader would be amused if he could see the papers on my\r\ndesk as I write all this, the mangled and disfigured pages, the\r\nexperimental arrangements of notes, the sheets of suggestions balanced\r\nin constellations, the blottesque intellectual battlegrounds over which\r\nI have been fighting. I find this account of my relations to Beatrice\r\nquite the most difficult part of my story to write. I happen to be a\r\nvery objective-minded person, I forget my moods, and this was so much\r\nan affair of moods. And even such moods and emotions as I recall are\r\nvery difficult to convey. To me it is about as difficult as describing\r\na taste or a scent.\r\n\r\nThen the objective story is made up of little things that are difficult\r\nto set in a proper order. And love in an hysterical passion, now high,\r\nnow low, now exalted, and now intensely physical. No one has ever yet\r\ndared to tell a love story completely, its alternations, its comings\r\nand goings, its debased moments, its hate. The love stories we tell,\r\ntell only the net consequence, the ruling effect....\r\n\r\nHow can I rescue from the past now the mystical quality of Beatrice; my\r\nintense longing for her; the overwhelming, irrational, formless desire?\r\nHow can I explain how intimately that worship mingled with a high,\r\nimpatient resolve to make her mine, to take her by strength and\r\ncourage, to do my loving in a violent heroic manner? And then the\r\ndoubts, the puzzled arrest at the fact of her fluctuations, at her\r\nrefusal to marry me, at the fact that even when at last she returned to\r\nBedley Corner she seemed to evade me?\r\n\r\nThat exasperated me and perplexed me beyond measure.\r\n\r\nI felt that it was treachery. I thought of every conceivable\r\nexplanation, and the most exalted and romantic confidence in her did\r\nnot simply alternate, but mingled with the basest misgivings.\r\n\r\nAnd into the tangle of memories comes the figure of Carnaby, coming out\r\nslowly from the background to a position of significance, as an\r\ninfluence, as a predominant strand in the nets that kept us apart, as a\r\nrival. What were the forces that pulled her away from me when it was so\r\nclearly manifest she loved me? Did she think of marrying him? Had I\r\ninvaded some long-planned scheme? It was evident he did not like me,\r\nthat in some way I spoilt the world for him. She returned to Bedley\r\nCorner, and for some weeks she was flitting about me, and never once\r\ncould I have talk with her alone. When she came to my sheds Carnaby was\r\nalways with her, jealously observant. (Why the devil couldn’t she send\r\nhim about his business?) The days slipped by and my anger gathered.\r\n\r\nAll this mingles with the making of Lord Roberts β. I had resolved upon\r\nthat one night as I lay awake at Bedley Corner; I got it planned out\r\nbefore the bandages were off my face. I conceived this second navigable\r\nballoon in a grandiose manner. It was to be a second Lord Roberts α,\r\nonly more so; it was to be three times as big, large enough to carry\r\nthree men, and it was to be an altogether triumphant vindication of my\r\nclaims upon the air. The framework was to be hollow like a bird’s\r\nbones, airtight, and the air pumped in or out, and the weight of fuel I\r\ncarried changed. I talked much and boasted to Cothope—whom I suspected\r\nof scepticisms about this new type—of what it would do, and it\r\nprogressed—slowly. It progressed slowly because I was restless and\r\nuncertain. At times I would go away to London to snatch some chance of\r\nseeing Beatrice there, at times nothing but a day of gliding and hard\r\nand dangerous exercise would satisfy me. And now in the newspapers, in\r\nconversation, in everything about me, arose a new invader of my mental\r\nstates. Something was happening to the great schemes of my uncle’s\r\naffairs; people were beginning to doubt, to question. It was the first\r\nquiver of his tremendous insecurity, the first wobble of that gigantic\r\ncredit top he had kept spinning so long.\r\n\r\nThere were comings and goings, November and December slipped by. I had\r\ntwo unsatisfactory meetings with Beatrice, meetings that had no\r\nprivacy—in which we said things of the sort that need atmosphere,\r\nbaldly and furtively. I wrote to her several times and she wrote back\r\nnotes that I would sometimes respond to altogether, sometimes condemn\r\nas insincere evasions. “You don’t understand. I can’t just now explain.\r\nBe patient with me. Leave things a little while to me.” She wrote.\r\n\r\nI would talk aloud to these notes and wrangle over them in my\r\nworkroom—while the plans of Lord Roberts β waited.\r\n\r\n“You don’t give me a chance!” I would say. “Why don’t you let me know\r\nthe secret? That’s what I’m for—to settle difficulties! to tell\r\ndifficulties to!”\r\n\r\nAnd at last I could hold out no longer against these accumulating\r\npressures.\r\n\r\nI took an arrogant, outrageous line that left her no loopholes; I\r\nbehaved as though we were living in a melodrama.\r\n\r\n“You must come and talk to me,” I wrote, “or I will come and take you.\r\nI want you—and the time runs away.”\r\n\r\nWe met in a ride in the upper plantations. It must have been early in\r\nJanuary, for there was snow on the ground and on the branches of the\r\ntrees. We walked to and fro for an hour or more, and from the first I\r\npitched the key high in romance and made understandings impossible. It\r\nwas our worst time together. I boasted like an actor, and she, I know\r\nnot why, was tired and spiritless.\r\n\r\nNow I think over that talk in the light of all that has happened since,\r\nI can imagine how she came to me full of a human appeal I was too\r\nfoolish to let her make. I don’t know. I confess I have never\r\ncompletely understood Beatrice. I confess I am still perplexed at many\r\nthings she said and did. That afternoon, anyhow, I was impossible. I\r\nposed and scolded. I was—I said it—for “taking the Universe by the\r\nthroat!”\r\n\r\n“If it was only that,” she said, but though I heard, I did not heed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAt last she gave way to me and talked no more. Instead she looked at\r\nme—as a thing beyond her controlling, but none the less\r\ninteresting—much as she had looked at me from behind the skirts of Lady\r\nDrew in the Warren when we were children together.\r\n\r\nOnce even I thought she smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n“What are the difficulties” I cried, “there’s no difficulty I will not\r\novercome for you! Do your people think I’m no equal for you? Who says\r\nit? My dear, tell me to win a title! I’ll do it in five years!...\r\n\r\n“Here am I just grown a man at the sight of you. I have wanted\r\nsomething to fight for. Let me fight for you!...\r\n\r\n“I’m rich without intending it. Let me mean it, give me an honourable\r\nexcuse for it, and I’ll put all this rotten old Warren of England at\r\nyour feet!”\r\n\r\nI said such things as that. I write them down here in all their\r\nresounding base pride. I said these empty and foolish things, and they\r\nare part of me. Why should I still cling to pride and be ashamed? I\r\nshouted her down.\r\n\r\nI passed from such megalomania to petty accusations.\r\n\r\n“You think Carnaby is a better man than I?” I said.\r\n\r\n“No!” she cried, stung to speech. “No!”\r\n\r\n“You think we’re unsubstantial. You’ve listened to all these rumours\r\nBoom has started because we talked of a newspaper of our own. When you\r\nare with me you know I’m a man; when you get away from me you think I’m\r\na cheat and a cad.... There’s not a word of truth in the things they\r\nsay about us. I’ve been slack. I’ve left things. But we have only to\r\nexert ourselves. You do not know how wide and far we have spread our\r\nnets. Even now we have a coup—an expedition—in hand. It will put us on\r\na footing.”...\r\n\r\nHer eyes asked mutely and asked in vain that I would cease to boast of\r\nthe very qualities she admired in me.\r\n\r\nIn the night I could not sleep for thinking of that talk and the vulgar\r\nthings I had said in it. I could not understand the drift my mind had\r\ntaken. I was acutely disgusted. And my unwonted doubts about myself\r\nspread from a merely personal discontent to our financial position. It\r\nwas all very well to talk as I had done of wealth and power and\r\npeerages, but what did I know nowadays of my uncle’s position? Suppose\r\nin the midst of such boasting and confidence there came some turn I did\r\nnot suspect, some rottenness he had concealed from me? I resolved I had\r\nbeen playing with aeronautics long enough; that next morning I would go\r\nto him and have things clear between us.\r\n\r\nI caught an early train and went up to the Hardingham.\r\n\r\nI went up to the Hardingham through a dense London fog to see how\r\nthings really stood. Before I had talked to my uncle for ten minutes I\r\nfelt like a man who has just awakened in a bleak, inhospitable room out\r\nof a grandiose dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH\r\nHOW I STOLE THE HEAPS OF QUAP FROM MORDET ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n“We got to make a fight for it,” said my uncle. “We got to face the\r\nmusic!”\r\n\r\nI remember that even at the sight of him I had a sense of impending\r\ncalamity. He sat under the electric light with the shadow of his hair\r\nmaking bars down his face. He looked shrunken, and as though his skin\r\nhad suddenly got loose and yellow. The decorations of the room seemed\r\nto have lost freshness, and outside the blinds were up—there was not so\r\nmuch fog as a dun darkness. One saw the dingy outlines of the chimneys\r\nopposite quite distinctly, and then a sky of such brown as only London\r\ncan display.\r\n\r\n“I saw a placard,” I said: “‘More Ponderevity.’”\r\n\r\n“That’s Boom,” he said. “Boom and his damned newspapers. He’s trying to\r\nfight me down. Ever since I offered to buy the _Daily Decorator_ he’s\r\nbeen at me. And he thinks consolidating Do Ut cut down the ads. He\r\nwants everything, damn him! He’s got no sense of dealing. I’d like to\r\nbash his face!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “what’s to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Keep going,” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“I’ll smash Boom yet,” he said, with sudden savagery.\r\n\r\n“Nothing else?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“We got to keep going. There’s a scare on. Did you notice the rooms?\r\nHalf the people out there this morning are reporters. And if I talk\r\nthey touch it up!... They didn’t used to touch things up! Now they put\r\nin character touches—insulting you. Don’t know what journalism’s coming\r\nto. It’s all Boom’s doing.”\r\n\r\nHe cursed Lord Boom with considerable imaginative vigour.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, “what can he do?”\r\n\r\n“Shove us up against time, George; make money tight for us. We been\r\nhandling a lot of money—and he tightens us up.”\r\n\r\n“We’re sound?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we’re sound, George. Trust me for that! But all the same—There’s\r\nsuch a lot of imagination in these things.... We’re sound enough.\r\nThat’s not it.”\r\n\r\nHe blew. “Damn Boom!” he said, and his eyes over his glasses met mine\r\ndefiantly.\r\n\r\n“We can’t, I suppose, run close hauled for a bitstop expenditure?”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Well,—Crest Hill”\r\n\r\n“What!” he shouted. “Me stop Crest Hill for Boom!” He waved a fist as\r\nif to hit his inkpot, and controlled himself with difficulty. He spoke\r\nat last in a reasonable voice. “If I did,” he said, “he’d kick up a\r\nfuss. It’s no good, even if I wanted to. Everybody’s watching the\r\nplace. If I was to stop building we’d be down in a week.”\r\n\r\nHe had an idea. “I wish I could do something to start a strike or\r\nsomething. No such luck. Treat those workmen a sight too well. No, sink\r\nor swim, Crest Hill goes on until we’re under water.”\r\n\r\nI began to ask questions and irritated him instantly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dash these explanations, George!” he cried; “You only make things\r\nlook rottener than they are. It’s your way. It isn’t a case of figures.\r\nWe’re all right—there’s only one thing we got to do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Show value, George. That’s where this quap comes in; that’s why I fell\r\nin so readily with what you brought to me week before last. Here we\r\nare, we got our option on the perfect filament, and all we want’s\r\ncanadium. Nobody knows there’s more canadium in the world than will go\r\non the edge of a sixpence except me and you. Nobody has an idee the\r\nperfect filament’s more than just a bit of theorising. Fifty tons of\r\nquap and we’d turn that bit of theorising into something. We’d make the\r\nlamp trade sit on its tail and howl. We’d put Ediswan and all of ’em\r\ninto a parcel without last year’s trousers and a hat, and swap ’em off\r\nfor a pot of geraniums. See? We’d do it through Business Organisations,\r\nand there you are! See? Capern’s Patent Filament!\r\n\r\n“The Ideal and the Real! George, we’ll do it! We’ll bring it off! And\r\nthen we’ll give such a facer to Boom, he’ll think for fifty years. He’s\r\nlaying up for our London and African meeting. Let him. He can turn the\r\nwhole paper on to us. He says the Business Organisations shares aren’t\r\nworth fifty-two and we quote ’em at eighty-four. Well, here we are\r\ngettin’ ready for him—loading our gun.”\r\n\r\nHis pose was triumphant.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “that’s all right. But I can’t help thinking where\r\nshould we be if we hadn’t just by accident got Capern’s Perfect\r\nFilament. Because, you know it was an accident—my buying up that.”\r\n\r\nHe crumpled up his nose into an expression of impatient distaste at my\r\nunreasonableness.\r\n\r\n“And after all, the meeting’s in June, and you haven’t begun to get the\r\nquap! After all, we’ve still got to load our gun.”\r\n\r\n“They start on Toosday.”\r\n\r\n“Have they got the brig?”\r\n\r\n“They’ve got a brig.”\r\n\r\n“Gordon-Nasmyth!” I doubted.\r\n\r\n“Safe as a bank,” he said. “More I see of that man the more I like him.\r\nAll I wish is we’d got a steamer instead of a sailing ship.”\r\n\r\n“And,” I went on, “you seem to overlook what used to weigh with us a\r\nbit. This canadium side of the business and the Capern chance has\r\nrushed you off your legs. After all—it’s stealing, and in its way an\r\ninternational outrage. They’ve got two gunboats on the coast.”\r\n\r\nI jumped up and went and stared out at the fog.\r\n\r\n“And, by Jove, it’s about our only chance! I didn’t dream.”\r\n\r\nI turned on him. “I’ve been up in the air,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Heaven knows where I haven’t been. And here’s our only chance—and you\r\ngive it to that adventurous lunatic to play in his own way—in a brig!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you had a voice—”\r\n\r\n“I wish I’d been in this before. We ought to have run out a steamer to\r\nLagos or one of those West Coast places and done it from there. Fancy a\r\nbrig in the channel at this time of year, if it blows southwest!”\r\n\r\n“I dessay you’d have shoved it, George. Still you know, George.... I\r\nbelieve in him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said. “Yes, I believe in him, too. In a way. Still—”\r\n\r\nWe took up a telegram that was lying on his desk and opened it. His\r\nface became a livid yellow. He put the flimsy paper down with a slow,\r\nreluctant movement and took off his glasses.\r\n\r\n“George,” he said, “the luck’s against us.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nHe grimaced with his mouth—in the queerest way at the telegram.\r\n\r\n“That.”\r\n\r\nI took it up and read:\r\n\r\n“Motor smash compound fracture of the leg gordon nasmyth what price\r\nmordet now”\r\n\r\nFor a moment neither of us spoke.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” I said at last.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said my uncle.\r\n\r\n“_I’m_ going. I’ll get that quap or bust.”\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI had a ridiculous persuasion that I was “saving the situation.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going,” I said quite consciously and dramatically. I saw the whole\r\naffair—how shall I put it?—in American colours.\r\n\r\nI sat down beside him. “Give me all the data you’ve got,” I said, “and\r\nI’ll pull this thing off.”\r\n\r\n“But nobody knows exactly where—”\r\n\r\n“Nasmyth does, and he’ll tell me.”\r\n\r\n“He’s been very close,” said my uncle, and regarded me.\r\n\r\n“He’ll tell me all right, now he’s smashed.”\r\n\r\nHe thought. “I believe he will.”\r\n\r\n“George,” he said, “if you pull this thing off—Once or twice before\r\nyou’ve stepped in—with that sort of Woosh of yours—”\r\n\r\nHe left the sentence unfinished.\r\n\r\n“Give me that note-book,” I said, “and tell me all you know. Where’s\r\nthe ship? Where’s Pollack? And where’s that telegram from? If that\r\nquap’s to be got, I’ll get it or bust. If you’ll hold on here until I\r\nget back with it.”...\r\n\r\nAnd so it was I jumped into the wildest adventure of my life.\r\n\r\nI requisitioned my uncle’s best car forthwith. I went down that night\r\nto the place of despatch named on Nasmyth’s telegram, Bampton S.O.\r\nOxon, routed him out with a little trouble from that centre, made\r\nthings right with him and got his explicit directions; and I was\r\ninspecting the _Maud Mary_ with young Pollack, his cousin and aide, the\r\nfollowing afternoon. She was rather a shock to me and not at all in my\r\nstyle, a beast of a brig inured to the potato trade, and she reeked\r\nfrom end to end with the faint, subtle smell of raw potatoes so that it\r\nprevailed even over the temporary smell of new paint. She was a beast\r\nof a brig, all hold and dirty framework, and they had ballasted her\r\nwith old iron and old rails and iron sleepers, and got a miscellaneous\r\nlot of spades and iron wheelbarrows against the loading of the quap. I\r\nthought her over with Pollack, one of those tall blond young men who\r\nsmoke pipes and don’t help much, and then by myself, and as a result I\r\ndid my best to sweep Gravesend clean of wheeling planks, and got in as\r\nmuch cord and small rope as I could for lashing. I had an idea we might\r\nneed to run up a jetty. In addition to much ballast she held, remotely\r\nhidden in a sort of inadvertent way a certain number of ambiguous cases\r\nwhich I didn’t examine, but which I gathered were a provision against\r\nthe need of a trade.\r\n\r\nThe captain was a most extraordinary creature, under the impression we\r\nwere after copper ore; he was a Roumanian Jew, with twitching,\r\nexcitable features, who had made his way to a certificate after some\r\npreliminary naval experiences in the Black Sea. The mate was an Essex\r\nman of impenetrable reserve. The crew were astoundingly ill-clad and\r\ndestitute and dirty; most of them youths, unwashed, out of colliers.\r\nOne, the cook was a mulatto; and one, the best-built fellow of them\r\nall, was a Breton. There was some subterfuge about our position on\r\nboard—I forget the particulars now—I was called the supercargo and\r\nPollack was the steward. This added to the piratical flavour that\r\ninsufficient funds and Gordon-Nasmyth’s original genius had already\r\ngiven the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThose two days of bustle at Gravesend, under dingy skies, in narrow,\r\ndirty streets, were a new experience for me. It is like nothing else in\r\nmy life. I realised that I was a modern and a civilised man. I found\r\nthe food filthy and the coffee horrible; the whole town stank in my\r\nnostrils, the landlord of the Good Intent on the quay had a stand-up\r\nquarrel with us before I could get even a hot bath, and the bedroom I\r\nslept in was infested by a quantity of exotic but voracious flat\r\nparasites called locally “bugs,” in the walls, in the woodwork,\r\neverywhere. I fought them with insect powder, and found them comatose\r\nin the morning. I was dipping down into the dingy underworld of the\r\ncontemporary state, and I liked it no better than I did my first dip\r\ninto it when I stayed with my Uncle Nicodemus Frapp at the bakery at\r\nChatham—where, by-the-by, we had to deal with cockroaches of a smaller,\r\ndarker variety, and also with bugs of sorts.\r\n\r\nLet me confess that through all this time before we started I was\r\nimmensely self-conscious, and that Beatrice played the part of audience\r\nin my imagination throughout. I was, as I say, “saving the situation,”\r\nand I was acutely aware of that. The evening before we sailed, instead\r\nof revising our medicine-chest as I had intended, I took the car and\r\nran across country to Lady Grove to tell my aunt of the journey I was\r\nmaking, dress, and astonish Lady Osprey by an after dinner call.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies were at home and alone beside a big fire that seemed\r\nwonderfully cheerful after the winter night. I remember the effect of\r\nthe little parlour in which they sat as very bright and domestic. Lady\r\nOsprey, in a costume of mauve and lace, sat on a chintz sofa and played\r\nan elaborately spread-out patience by the light of a tall shaded lamp;\r\nBeatrice, in a whiteness that showed her throat, smoked a cigarette in\r\nan armchair and read with a lamp at her elbow. The room was\r\nwhite-panelled and chintz-curtained. About those two bright centres of\r\nlight were warm dark shadow, in which a circular mirror shone like a\r\npool of brown water. I carried off my raid by behaving like a slave of\r\netiquette. There were moments when I think I really made Lady Osprey\r\nbelieve that my call was an unavoidable necessity, that it would have\r\nbeen negligent of me not to call just how and when I did. But at the\r\nbest those were transitory moments.\r\n\r\nThey received me with disciplined amazement. Lady Osprey was interested\r\nin my face and scrutinised the scar. Beatrice stood behind her\r\nsolicitude. Our eyes met, and in hers I could see startled\r\ninterrogations.\r\n\r\n“I’m going,” I said, “to the west coast of Africa.”\r\n\r\nThey asked questions, but it suited my mood to be vague.\r\n\r\n“We’ve interests there. It is urgent I should go. I don’t know when I\r\nmay return.”\r\n\r\nAfter that I perceived Beatrice surveyed me steadily.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was rather difficult. I embarked upon lengthy thanks\r\nfor their kindness to me after my accident. I tried to understand Lady\r\nOsprey’s game of patience, but it didn’t appear that Lady Osprey was\r\nanxious for me to understand her patience. I came to the verge of\r\ntaking my leave.\r\n\r\n“You needn’t go yet,” said Beatrice, abruptly.\r\n\r\nShe walked across to the piano, took a pile of music from the cabinet\r\nnear, surveyed Lady Osprey’s back, and with a gesture to me dropped it\r\nall deliberately on to the floor.\r\n\r\n“Must talk,” she said, kneeling close to me as I helped her to pick it\r\nup. “Turn my pages. At the piano.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t read music.”\r\n\r\n“Turn my pages.”\r\n\r\nPresently we were at the piano, and Beatrice was playing with noisy\r\ninaccuracy. She glanced over her shoulder and Lady Osprey had resumed\r\nher patience. The old lady was very pink, and appeared to be absorbed\r\nin some attempt to cheat herself without our observing it.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t West Africa a vile climate?” “Are you going to live there?” “Why\r\nare you going?”\r\n\r\nBeatrice asked these questions in a low voice and gave me no chance to\r\nanswer. Then taking a rhythm from the music before her, she said—\r\n\r\n“At the back of the house is a garden—a door in the wall—on the lane.\r\nUnderstand?”\r\n\r\nI turned over the pages without any effect on her playing.\r\n\r\n“When?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe dealt in chords. “I wish I _could_ play this!” she said.\r\n“Midnight.”\r\n\r\nShe gave her attention to the music for a time.\r\n\r\n“You may have to wait.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll wait.”\r\n\r\nShe brought her playing to an end by—as school boys say—“stashing it\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t play to-night,” she said, standing up and meeting my eyes. “I\r\nwanted to give you a parting voluntary.”\r\n\r\n“Was that Wagner, Beatrice?” asked Lady Osprey looking up from her\r\ncards. “It sounded very confused.”\r\n\r\nI took my leave. I had a curious twinge of conscience as I parted from\r\nLady Osprey. Either a first intimation of middle-age or my inexperience\r\nin romantic affairs was to blame, but I felt a very distinct objection\r\nto the prospect of invading this good lady’s premises from the garden\r\ndoor. I motored up to the pavilion, found Cothope reading in bed, told\r\nhim for the first time of West Africa, spent an hour with him in\r\nsettling all the outstanding details of Lord Roberts β, and left that\r\nin his hands to finish against my return. I sent the motor back to Lady\r\nGrove, and still wearing my fur coat—for the January night was damp and\r\nbitterly cold—walked to Bedley Corner. I found the lane to the back of\r\nthe Dower House without any difficulty, and was at the door in the wall\r\nwith ten minutes to spare. I lit a cigar and fell to walking up and\r\ndown. This queer flavour of intrigue, this nocturnal garden-door\r\nbusiness, had taken me by surprise and changed my mental altitudes. I\r\nwas startled out of my egotistical pose and thinking intently of\r\nBeatrice, of that elfin quality in her that always pleased me, that\r\nalways took me by surprise, that had made her for example so instantly\r\nconceive this meeting.\r\n\r\nShe came within a minute of midnight; the door opened softly and she\r\nappeared, a short, grey figure in a motor-coat of sheepskin, bareheaded\r\nto the cold drizzle. She flitted up to me, and her eyes were shadows in\r\nher dusky face.\r\n\r\n“Why are you going to West Africa?” she asked at once.\r\n\r\n“Business crisis. I have to go.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not going—? You’re coming back?”\r\n\r\n“Three or four months,” I said, “at most.”\r\n\r\n“Then, it’s nothing to do with me?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” I said. “Why should it have?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s all right. One never knows what people think or what people\r\nfancy.” She took me by the arm, “Let’s go for a walk,” she said.\r\n\r\nI looked about me at darkness and rain.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” she laughed. “We can go along the lane and into the\r\nOld Woking Road. Do you mind? Of course you don’t. My head. It doesn’t\r\nmatter. One never meets anybody.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve wandered like this before.... Of course. Did you think”—she\r\nnodded her head back at her home—“that’s all?”\r\n\r\n“No, by Jove!” I cried; “it’s manifest it isn’t.”\r\n\r\nShe took my arm and turned me down the lane. “Night’s my time,” she\r\nsaid by my side. “There’s a touch of the werewolf in my blood. One\r\nnever knows in these old families.... I’ve wondered often.... Here we\r\nare, anyhow, alone in the world. Just darkness and cold and a sky of\r\nclouds and wet. And we—together.\r\n\r\n“I like the wet on my face and hair, don’t you? When do you sail?”\r\n\r\nI told her to-morrow.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, there’s no to-morrow now. You and I!” She stopped and\r\nconfronted me.\r\n\r\n“You don’t say a word except to answer!”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Last time you did all the talking.”\r\n\r\n“Like a fool. Now—”\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other’s two dim faces. “You’re glad to be here?”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad—I’m beginning to be—it’s more than glad.”\r\n\r\nShe put her hands on my shoulders and drew me down to kiss her.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she said, and for a moment or so we just clung to one another.\r\n\r\n“That’s all,” she said, releasing herself. “What bundles of clothes we\r\nare to-night. I felt we should kiss some day again. Always. The last\r\ntime was ages ago.”\r\n\r\n“Among the fern stalks.”\r\n\r\n“Among the bracken. You remember. And your lips were cold. Were mine?\r\nThe same lips—after so long—after so much!... And now let’s trudge\r\nthrough this blotted-out world together for a time. Yes, let me take\r\nyour arm. Just trudge. See? Hold tight to me because I know the way—and\r\ndon’t talk—don’t talk. Unless you want to talk.... Let me tell you\r\nthings! You see, dear, the whole world is blotted out—it’s dead and\r\ngone, and we’re in this place. This dark wild place.... We’re dead. Or\r\nall the world is dead. No! We’re dead. No one can see us. We’re\r\nshadows. We’ve got out of our positions, out of our bodies—and\r\ntogether. That’s the good thing of it—together. But that’s why the\r\nworld can’t see us and why we hardly see the world. Sssh! Is it all\r\nright?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” I said.\r\n\r\nWe stumbled along for a time in a close silence. We passed a dim-lit,\r\nrain-veiled window.\r\n\r\n“The silly world,” she said, “the silly world! It eats and sleeps. If\r\nthe wet didn’t patter so from the trees we’d hear it snoring. It’s\r\ndreaming such stupid things—stupid judgments. It doesn’t know we are\r\npassing, we two—free of it—clear of it. You and I!”\r\n\r\nWe pressed against each other reassuringly.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad we’re dead,” she whispered. “I’m glad we’re dead. I was tired\r\nof it, dear. I was so tired of it, dear, and so entangled.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\nWe splashed through a string of puddles. I began to remember things I\r\nhad meant to say.\r\n\r\n“Look here!” I cried. “I want to help you beyond measure. You are\r\nentangled. What is the trouble? I asked you to marry me. You said you\r\nwould. But there’s something.”\r\n\r\nMy thoughts sounded clumsy as I said them.\r\n\r\n“Is it something about my position?... Or is it something—perhaps—about\r\nsome other man?”\r\n\r\nThere was an immense assenting silence.\r\n\r\n“You’ve puzzled me so. At first—I mean quite early—I thought you meant\r\nto make me marry you.”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“To-night,” she said after a long pause, “I can’t explain. No! I can’t\r\nexplain. I love you! But—explanations! To-night my dear, here we are in\r\nthe world alone—and the world doesn’t matter. Nothing matters. Here I\r\nam in the cold with you and my bed away there deserted. I’d tell you—I\r\n_will_ tell you when things enable me to tell you, and soon enough they\r\nwill. But to-night—I won’t—I won’t.”\r\n\r\nShe left my side and went in front of me.\r\n\r\nShe turned upon me. “Look here,” she said, “I insist upon your being\r\ndead. Do you understand? I’m not joking. To-night you and I are out of\r\nlife. It’s our time together. There may be other times, but this we\r\nwon’t spoil. We’re—in Hades if you like. Where there’s nothing to hide\r\nand nothing to tell. No bodies even. No bothers. We loved each\r\nother—down there—and were kept apart, but now it doesn’t matter. It’s\r\nover.... If you won’t agree to that—I will go home.”\r\n\r\n“I wanted,” I began.\r\n\r\n“I know. Oh! my dear, if you’d only understand I understand. If you’d\r\nonly not care—and love me to-night.”\r\n\r\n“I do love you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Then _love_ me,” she answered, “and leave all the things that bother\r\nyou. Love me! Here I am!”\r\n\r\n“But!—”\r\n\r\n“No!” she said.\r\n\r\n“Well, have your way.”\r\n\r\nSo she carried her point, and we wandered into the night together and\r\nBeatrice talked to me of love....\r\n\r\nI’d never heard a woman before in all my life who could talk of love,\r\nwho could lay bare and develop and touch with imagination all that mass\r\nof fine emotion every woman, it may be, hides. She had read of love,\r\nshe had thought of love, a thousand sweet lyrics had sounded through\r\nher brain and left fine fragments in her memory; she poured it out, all\r\nof it, shamelessly, skilfully, for me. I cannot give any sense of that\r\ntalk, I cannot even tell how much of the delight of it was the magic of\r\nher voice, the glow of her near presence. And always we walked swathed\r\nwarmly through a chilly air, along dim, interminable greasy roads—with\r\nnever a soul abroad it seemed to us, never a beast in the fields.\r\n\r\n“Why do people love each other?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“But why do I love you? Why is your voice better than any voice, your\r\nface sweeter than any face?”\r\n\r\n“And why do I love you?” she asked; “not only what is fine in you, but\r\nwhat isn’t? Why do I love your dullness, your arrogance? For I do.\r\nTo—night I love the very raindrops on the fur of your coat!”...\r\n\r\nSo we talked; and at last very wet, still glowing but a little tired,\r\nwe parted at the garden door. We had been wandering for two hours in\r\nour strange irrational community of happiness, and all the world about\r\nus, and particularly Lady Osprey and her household, had been asleep—and\r\ndreaming of anything rather than Beatrice in the night and rain.\r\n\r\nShe stood in the doorway, a muffled figure with eyes that glowed.\r\n\r\n“Come back,” she whispered. “I shall wait for you.”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\nShe touched the lapel of my coat. “I love you NOW,” she said, and\r\nlifted her face to mine.\r\n\r\nI held her to me and was atremble from top to toe. “O God!” I cried.\r\n“And I must go!”\r\n\r\nShe slipped from my arms and paused, regarding me. For an instant the\r\nworld seemed full of fantastic possibilities.\r\n\r\n“Yes, _Go!_” she said, and vanished and slammed the door upon me,\r\nleaving me alone like a man new fallen from fairyland in the black\r\ndarkness of the night.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThat expedition to Mordet Island stands apart from all the rest of my\r\nlife, detached, a piece by itself with an atmosphere of its own. It\r\nwould, I suppose, make a book by itself—it has made a fairly voluminous\r\nofficial report—but so far as this novel of mine goes it is merely an\r\nepisode, a contributory experience, and I mean to keep it at that.\r\n\r\nVile weather, an impatient fretting against unbearable slowness and\r\ndelay, sea—sickness, general discomfort and humiliating self—revelation\r\nare the master values of these memories.\r\n\r\nI was sick all through the journey out. I don’t know why. It was the\r\nonly time I was ever sea-sick, and I have seen some pretty bad weather\r\nsince I became a boat-builder. But that phantom smell of potatoes was\r\npeculiarly vile to me. Coming back on the brig we were all ill, every\r\none of us, so soon as we got to sea, poisoned, I firmly believe, by\r\nquap. On the way out most of the others recovered in a few days, but\r\nthe stuffiness below, the coarse food, the cramped dirty accommodation\r\nkept me, if not actually sea-sick, in a state of acute physical\r\nwretchedness the whole time. The ship abounded in cockroaches and more\r\nintimate vermin. I was cold all the time until after we passed Cape\r\nVerde, then I became steamily hot; I had been too preoccupied with\r\nBeatrice and my keen desire to get the _Maud Mary_ under way at once,\r\nto consider a proper wardrobe for myself, and in particular I lacked a\r\ncoat. Heavens! how I lacked that coat! And, moreover, I was cooped up\r\nwith two of the worst bores in Christendom, Pollack and the captain.\r\nPollack, after conducting his illness in a style better adapted to the\r\ncapacity of an opera house than a small compartment, suddenly got\r\ninsupportably well and breezy, and produced a manly pipe in which he\r\nsmoked a tobacco as blond as himself, and divided his time almost\r\nequally between smoking it and trying to clean it. “There’s only three\r\nthings you can clean a pipe with,” he used to remark with a twist of\r\npaper in hand. “The best’s a feather, the second’s a straw, and the\r\nthird’s a girl’s hairpin. I never see such a ship. You can’t find any\r\nof ’em. Last time I came this way I did find hairpins anyway, and found\r\n’em on the floor of the captain’s cabin. Regular deposit. Eh?...\r\nFeelin’ better?”\r\n\r\nAt which I usually swore.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’ll be all right soon. Don’t mind my puffin’ a bit? Eh?”\r\n\r\nHe never tired of asking me to “have a hand at Nap. Good game. Makes\r\nyou forget it, and that’s half the battle.”\r\n\r\nHe would sit swaying with the rolling of the ship and suck at his pipe\r\nof blond tobacco and look with an inexpressibly sage but somnolent blue\r\neye at the captain by the hour together. “Captain’s a Card,” he would\r\nsay over and over again as the outcome of these meditations. “He’d like\r\nto know what we’re up to. He’d like to know—no end.”\r\n\r\nThat did seem to be the captain’s ruling idea. But he also wanted to\r\nimpress me with the notion that he was a gentleman of good family and\r\nto air a number of views adverse to the English, to English literature,\r\nto the English constitution, and the like.\r\n\r\nHe had learnt the sea in the Roumanian navy, and English out of a book;\r\nhe would still at times pronounce the e’s at the end of “there” and\r\n“here”; he was a naturalised Englishman, and he drove me into a\r\nreluctant and uncongenial patriotism by his everlasting carping at\r\nthings English. Pollack would set himself to “draw him out.” Heaven\r\nalone can tell how near I came to murder.\r\n\r\nFifty-three days I had outward, cooped up with these two and a shy and\r\nprofoundly depressed mate who read the Bible on Sundays and spent the\r\nrest of his leisure in lethargy, three and fifty days of life cooped up\r\nin a perpetual smell, in a persistent sick hunger that turned from the\r\nsight of food, in darkness, cold and wet, in a lightly ballasted ship\r\nthat rolled and pitched and swayed. And all the time the sands in the\r\nhour-glass of my uncle’s fortunes were streaming out. Misery! Amidst it\r\nall I remember only one thing brightly, one morning of sunshine in the\r\nBay of Biscay and a vision of frothing waves, sapphire green, a bird\r\nfollowing our wake and our masts rolling about the sky. Then wind and\r\nrain close in on us again.\r\n\r\nYou must not imagine they were ordinary days, days, I mean, of an\r\naverage length; they were not so much days as long damp slabs of time\r\nthat stretched each one to the horizon, and much of that length was\r\nnight. One paraded the staggering deck in a borrowed sou’-wester hour\r\nafter hour in the chilly, windy, splashing and spitting darkness, or\r\nsat in the cabin, bored and ill, and looked at the faces of those\r\ninseparable companions by the help of a lamp that gave smell rather\r\nthan light. Then one would see going up, up, up, and then sinking down,\r\ndown, down, Pollack, extinct pipe in mouth, humorously observant,\r\nbringing his mind slowly to the seventy-seventh decision that the\r\ncaptain was a Card, while the words flowed from the latter in a nimble\r\nincessant good. “Dis England eet is not a country aristocratic, no! Eet\r\nis a glorified bourgeoisie! Eet is plutocratic. In England dere is no\r\naristocracy since de Wars of Roses. In the rest of Europe east of the\r\nLatins, yes; in England, no.\r\n\r\n“Eet is all middle-class, youra England. Everything you look at,\r\nmiddle-class. Respectable! Everything good—eet is, you say, shocking.\r\nMadame Grundy! Eet is all limited and computing and self-seeking. Dat\r\nis why your art is so limited, youra fiction, your philosophin, why you\r\nare all so inartistic. You want nothing but profit! What will pay! What\r\nwould you?”...\r\n\r\nHe had all those violent adjuncts to speech we Western Europeans have\r\nabandoned, shruggings of the shoulders, waving of the arms, thrusting\r\nout of the face, wonderful grimaces and twiddlings of the hands under\r\nyour nose until you wanted to hit them away. Day after day it went on,\r\nand I had to keep any anger to myself, to reserve myself for the time\r\nahead when it would be necessary to see the quap was got aboard and\r\nstowed—knee deep in this man’s astonishment. I knew he would make a\r\nthousand objections to all we had before us. He talked like a drugged\r\nman. It ran glibly over his tongue. And all the time one could see his\r\nseamanship fretting him, he was gnawed by responsibility, perpetually\r\nuneasy about the ship’s position, perpetually imagining dangers. If a\r\nsea hit us exceptionally hard he’d be out of the cabin in an instant\r\nmaking an outcry of inquiries, and he was pursued by a dread of the\r\nhold, of ballast shifting, of insidious wicked leaks. As we drew near\r\nthe African coast his fear of rocks and shoals became infectious.\r\n\r\n“I do not know dis coast,” he used to say. “I cama hera because\r\nGordon-Nasmyth was coming too. Den he does not come!”\r\n\r\n“Fortunes of war,” I said, and tried to think in vain if any motive but\r\nsheer haphazard could have guided Gordon-Nasmyth in the choice of these\r\ntwo men. I think perhaps Gordon-Nasmyth had the artistic temperament\r\nand wanted contrasts, and also that the captain helped him to express\r\nhis own malignant Anti-Britishism.\r\n\r\nHe was indeed an exceptionally inefficient captain. On the whole I was\r\nglad I had come even at the eleventh hour to see to things.\r\n\r\n(The captain, by-the-by, did at last, out of sheer nervousness, get\r\naground at the end of Mordet’s Island, but we got off in an hour or so\r\nwith a swell and a little hard work in the boat.)\r\n\r\nI suspected the mate of his opinion of the captain long before he\r\nexpressed it. He was, I say, a taciturn man, but one day speech broke\r\nthrough him. He had been sitting at the table with his arms folded on\r\nit, musing drearily, pipe in mouth, and the voice of the captain\r\ndrifted down from above.\r\n\r\nThe mate lifted his heavy eyes to me and regarded me for a moment. Then\r\nhe began to heave with the beginnings of speech. He disembarrassed\r\nhimself of his pipe. I cowered with expectation. Speech was coming at\r\nlast. Before he spoke he nodded reassuringly once or twice.\r\n\r\n“E—”\r\n\r\nHe moved his head strangely and mysteriously, but a child might have\r\nknown he spoke of the captain.\r\n\r\n“E’s a foreigner.”\r\n\r\nHe regarded me doubtfully for a time, and at last decided for the sake\r\nof lucidity to clench the matter.\r\n\r\n“That’s what E is—a _Dago!_”\r\n\r\nHe nodded like a man who gives a last tap to a nail, and I could see he\r\nconsidered his remark well and truly laid. His face, though still\r\nresolute, became as tranquil and uneventful as a huge hall after a\r\npublic meeting has dispersed out of it, and finally he closed and\r\nlocked it with his pipe.\r\n\r\n“Roumanian Jew, isn’t he?” I said.\r\n\r\nHe nodded darkly and almost forbiddingly.\r\n\r\nMore would have been too much. The thing was said. But from that time\r\nforth I knew I could depend upon him and that he and I were friends. It\r\nhappens I never did have to depend upon him, but that does not affect\r\nour relationship.\r\n\r\nForward the crew lived lives very much after the fashion of ours, more\r\ncrowded, more cramped and dirty, wetter, steamier, more verminous. The\r\ncoarse food they had was still not so coarse but that they did not\r\nthink they were living “like fighting cocks.” So far as I could make\r\nout they were all nearly destitute men; hardly any of them had a proper\r\nsea outfit, and what small possessions they had were a source of mutual\r\ndistrust. And as we pitched and floundered southward they gambled and\r\nfought, were brutal to one another, argued and wrangled loudly, until\r\nwe protested at the uproar.\r\n\r\nThere’s no romance about the sea in a small sailing ship as I saw it.\r\nThe romance is in the mind of the landsman dreamer. These brigs and\r\nschooners and brigantines that still stand out from every little port\r\nare relics from an age of petty trade, as rotten and obsolescent as a\r\nGeorgian house that has sunken into a slum. They are indeed just\r\nfloating fragments of slum, much as icebergs are floating fragments of\r\nglacier. The civilised man who has learnt to wash, who has developed a\r\nsense of physical honour, of cleanly temperate feeding, of time, can\r\nendure them no more. They pass, and the clanking coal-wasting steamers\r\nwill follow them, giving place to cleaner, finer things....\r\n\r\nBut so it was I made my voyage to Africa, and came at last into a world\r\nof steamy fogs and a hot smell of vegetable decay, and into sound and\r\nsight of surf and distant intermittent glimpses of the coast. I lived a\r\nstrange concentrated life through all that time, such a life as a\r\ncreature must do that has fallen in a well. All my former ways ceased,\r\nall my old vistas became memories.\r\n\r\nThe situation I was saving was very small and distant now; I felt its\r\nurgency no more. Beatrice and Lady Grove, my uncle and the Hardingham,\r\nmy soaring in the air and my habitual wide vision of swift effectual\r\nthings, became as remote as if they were in some world I had left for\r\never....\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAll these African memories stand by themselves. It was for me an\r\nexpedition into the realms of undisciplined nature out of the world\r\nthat is ruled by men, my first bout with that hot side of our mother\r\nthat gives you the jungle—that cold side that gives you the air-eddy I\r\nwas beginning to know passing well. They are memories woven upon a\r\nfabric of sunshine and heat and a constant warm smell of decay. They\r\nend in rain—such rain as I had never seen before, a vehement, a frantic\r\ndownpouring of water, but our first slow passage through the channels\r\nbehind Mordet’s Island was in incandescent sunshine.\r\n\r\nThere we go in my memory still, a blistered dirty ship with patched\r\nsails and a battered mermaid to present _Maud Mary_, sounding and\r\ntaking thought between high ranks of forest whose trees come out\r\nknee-deep at last in the water. There we go with a little breeze on our\r\nquarter, Mordet Island rounded and the quap, it might be within a day\r\nof us.\r\n\r\nHere and there strange blossoms woke the dank intensities of green with\r\na trumpet call of colour. Things crept among the jungle and peeped and\r\ndashed back rustling into stillness. Always in the sluggishly drifting,\r\nopaque water were eddyings and stirrings; little rushes of bubbles came\r\nchuckling up light-heartedly from this or that submerged conflict and\r\ntragedy; now and again were crocodiles like a stranded fleet of logs\r\nbasking in the sun. Still it was by day, a dreary stillness broken only\r\nby insect sounds and the creaking and flapping of our progress, by the\r\ncalling of the soundings and the captain’s confused shouts; but in the\r\nnight as we lay moored to a clump of trees the darkness brought a\r\nthousand swampy things to life and out of the forest came screaming and\r\nhowlings, screaming and yells that made us glad to be afloat. And once\r\nwe saw between the tree stems long blazing fires. We passed two or\r\nthree villages landward, and brown-black women and children came and\r\nstared at us and gesticulated, and once a man came out in a boat from a\r\ncreek and hailed us in an unknown tongue; and so at last we came to a\r\ngreat open place, a broad lake rimmed with a desolation of mud and\r\nbleached refuse and dead trees, free from crocodiles or water birds or\r\nsight or sound of any living thing, and saw far off, even as Nasmyth\r\nhad described, the ruins of the deserted station, and hard by two\r\nlittle heaps of buff-hued rubbish under a great rib of rock, the quap!\r\nThe forest receded. The land to the right of us fell away and became\r\nbarren, and far on across notch in its backbone was surf and the sea.\r\n\r\nWe took the ship in towards those heaps and the ruined jetty slowly and\r\ncarefully. The captain came and talked.\r\n\r\n“This is eet?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Is eet for trade we have come?”\r\n\r\nThis was ironical.\r\n\r\n“No,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Gordon-Nasmyth would haf told me long ago what it ees for we haf\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you now,” I said. “We are going to lay in as close as we can\r\nto those two heaps of stuff—you see them?—under the rock. Then we are\r\ngoing to chuck all our ballast overboard and take those in. Then we’re\r\ngoing home.”\r\n\r\n“May I presume to ask—is eet gold?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said incivilly, “it isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Then what is it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s stuff—of some commercial value.”\r\n\r\n“We can’t do eet,” he said.\r\n\r\n“We can,” I answered reassuringly.\r\n\r\n“We can’t,” he said as confidently. “I don’t mean what you mean. You\r\nknow so liddle—But—dis is forbidden country.”\r\n\r\nI turned on him suddenly angry and met bright excited eyes. For a\r\nminute we scrutinised one another. Then I said, “That’s our risk. Trade\r\nis forbidden. But this isn’t trade.... This thing’s got to be done.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes glittered and he shook his head....\r\n\r\nThe brig stood in slowly through the twilight toward this strange\r\nscorched and blistered stretch of beach, and the man at the wheel\r\nstrained his ears to listening the low-voiced angry argument that began\r\nbetween myself and the captain, that was presently joined by Pollack.\r\nWe moored at last within a hundred yards of our goal, and all through\r\nour dinner and far into the night we argued intermittently and fiercely\r\nwith the captain about our right to load just what we pleased. “I will\r\nhaf nothing to do with eet,” he persisted. “I wash my hands.” It seemed\r\nthat night as though we argued in vain. “If it is not trade,” he said,\r\n“it is prospecting and mining. That is worse. Any one who knows\r\nanything—outside England—knows that is worse.”\r\n\r\nWe argued and I lost my temper and swore at him. Pollack kept cooler\r\nand chewed his pipe watchfully with that blue eye of his upon the\r\ncaptain’s gestures. Finally I went on deck to cool. The sky was\r\novercast I discovered all the men were in a knot forward, staring at\r\nthe faint quivering luminosity that had spread over the heaps of quap,\r\na phosphorescence such as one sees at times on rotting wood. And about\r\nthe beach east and west there were patches and streaks of something\r\nlike diluted moonshine....\r\n\r\nIn the small hours I was still awake and turning over scheme after\r\nscheme in my mind whereby I might circumvent the captain’s opposition.\r\nI meant to get that quap aboard if I had to kill some one to do it.\r\nNever in my life had I been so thwarted! After this intolerable voyage!\r\nThere came a rap at my cabin door and then it opened and I made out a\r\nbearded face. “Come in,” I said, and a black voluble figure I could\r\njust see obscurely came in to talk in my private ear and fill my cabin\r\nwith its whisperings and gestures. It was the captain. He, too, had\r\nbeen awake and thinking things over. He had come to explain—enormously.\r\nI lay there hating him and wondering if I and Pollack could lock him in\r\nhis cabin and run the ship without him. “I do not want to spoil dis\r\nexpedition,” emerged from a cloud of protestations, and then I was able\r\nto disentangle “a commission—shush a small commission—for special\r\nrisks!” “Special risks” became frequent. I let him explain himself out.\r\nIt appeared he was also demanding an apology for something I had said.\r\nNo doubt I had insulted him generously. At last came definite offers. I\r\nbroke my silence and bargained.\r\n\r\n“Pollack!” I cried and hammered the partition.\r\n\r\n“What’s up?” asked Pollack.\r\n\r\nI stated the case concisely.\r\n\r\nThere came a silence.\r\n\r\n“He’s a Card,” said Pollack. “Let’s give him his commission. I don’t\r\nmind.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“I said he was a Card, that’s all,” said Pollack. “I’m coming.”\r\n\r\nHe appeared in my doorway a faint white figure joined our vehement\r\nwhisperings.\r\n\r\nWe had to buy the captain off; we had to promise him ten per cent. of\r\nour problematical profits. We were to give him ten per cent. on what we\r\nsold the cargo for over and above his legitimate pay, and I found in my\r\nout-bargained and disordered state small consolation in the thought\r\nthat I, as the Gordon-Nasmyth expedition, was to sell the stuff to\r\nmyself as Business Organisations. And he further exasperated me by\r\ninsisting on having our bargain in writing. “In the form of a letter,”\r\nhe insisted.\r\n\r\n“All right,” I acquiesced, “in the form of a letter. Here goes! Get a\r\nlight!”\r\n\r\n“And the apology,” he said, folding up the letter.\r\n\r\n“All right,” I said; “Apology.”\r\n\r\nMy hand shook with anger as I wrote, and afterwards I could not sleep\r\nfor hate of him. At last I got up. I suffered, I found, from an unusual\r\nclumsiness. I struck my toe against my cabin door, and cut myself as I\r\nshaved. I found myself at last pacing the deck under the dawn in a mood\r\nof extreme exasperation. The sun rose abruptly and splashed light\r\nblindingly into my eyes and I swore at the sun. I found myself\r\nimagining fresh obstacles with the men and talking aloud in\r\nanticipatory rehearsal of the consequent row.\r\n\r\nThe malaria of the quap was already in my blood.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSooner or later the ridiculous embargo that now lies upon all the coast\r\neastward of Mordet Island will be lifted and the reality of the\r\ndeposits of quap ascertained. I am sure that we were merely taking the\r\noutcrop of a stratum of nodulated deposits that dip steeply seaward.\r\nThose heaps were merely the crumbled out contents of two irregular\r\ncavities in the rock; they are as natural as any talus or heap of that\r\nkind, and the mud along the edge of the water for miles is mixed with\r\nquap, and is radio-active and lifeless and faintly phosphorescent at\r\nnight. But the reader will find the full particulars of my impression\r\nof all this in the _Geological Magazine_ for October, 1905, and to that\r\nI must refer him. There, too, he will find my unconfirmed theories of\r\nits nature. If I am right it is something far more significant from the\r\nscientific point of view than those incidental constituents of various\r\nrare metals, pitchblende, rutile, and the like, upon which the\r\nrevolutionary discoveries of the last decade are based. Those are just\r\nlittle molecular centres of disintegration, of that mysterious decay\r\nand rotting of those elements, elements once regarded as the most\r\nstable things in nature. But there is something—the only word that\r\ncomes near it is _cancerous_—and that is not very near, about the whole\r\nof quap, something that creeps and lives as a disease lives by\r\ndestroying; an elemental stirring and disarrangement, incalculably\r\nmaleficent and strange.\r\n\r\nThis is no imaginative comparison of mine. To my mind radio-activity is\r\na real disease of matter. Moreover, it is a contagious disease. It\r\nspreads. You bring those debased and crumbling atoms near others and\r\nthose too presently catch the trick of swinging themselves out of\r\ncoherent existence. It is in matter exactly what the decay of our old\r\nculture is in society, a loss of traditions and distinctions and\r\nassured reactions. When I think of these inexplicable dissolvent\r\ncentres that have come into being in our globe—these quap heaps are\r\nsurely by far the largest that have yet been found in the world; the\r\nrest as yet mere specks in grains and crystals—I am haunted by a\r\ngrotesque fancy of the ultimate eating away and dry-rotting and\r\ndispersal of all our world. So that while man still struggles and\r\ndreams his very substance will change and crumble from beneath him. I\r\nmention this here as a queer persistent fancy. Suppose, indeed, that is\r\nto be the end of our planet; no splendid climax and finale, no towering\r\naccumulation of achievements, but just—atomic decay! I add that to the\r\nideas of the suffocating comet, the dark body out of space, the burning\r\nout of the sun, the distorted orbit, as a new and far more possible\r\nend—as Science can see ends—to this strange by-play of matter that we\r\ncall human life. I do not believe this can be the end; no human soul\r\ncan believe in such an end and go on living, but to it science points\r\nas a possible thing, science and reason alike. If single human\r\nbeings—if one single ricketty infant—can be born as it were by accident\r\nand die futile, why not the whole race? These are questions I have\r\nnever answered, that now I never attempt to answer, but the thought of\r\nquap and its mysteries brings them back to me.\r\n\r\nI can witness that the beach and mud for two miles or more either way\r\nwas a lifeless beach—lifeless as I could have imagined no tropical mud\r\ncould ever be, and all the dead branches and leaves and rotting dead\r\nfish and so forth that drifted ashore became presently shrivelled and\r\nwhite. Sometimes crocodiles would come up out of the water and bask,\r\nand now and then water birds would explore the mud and rocky ribs that\r\nrose out of it, in a mood of transitory speculation. That was its\r\nutmost admiration. And the air felt at once hot and austere, dry and\r\nblistering, and altogether different the warm moist embrace that had\r\nmet us at our first African landfall and to which we had grown\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\nI believe that the primary influence of the quap upon us was to\r\nincrease the conductivity of our nerves, but that is a mere\r\nunjustifiable speculation on my part. At any rate it gave a sort of\r\neast wind effect to life. We all became irritable, clumsy, languid and\r\ndisposed to be impatient with our languor. We moored the brig to the\r\nrocks with difficulty, and got aground on mud and decided to stick\r\nthere and tow off when we had done—the bottom was as greasy as butter.\r\nOur efforts to fix up planks and sleepers in order to wheel the quap\r\naboard were as ill-conceived as that sort of work can be—and that sort\r\nof work can at times be very ill-conceived. The captain had a\r\nsuperstitious fear of his hold: he became wildly gesticulatory and\r\nexpository and incompetent at the bare thought of it. His shouts still\r\necho in my memory, becoming as each crisis approached less and less\r\nlike any known tongue.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot now write the history of those days of blundering and\r\ntoil: of how Milton, one of the boys, fell from a plank to the beach,\r\nthirty feet perhaps, with his barrow and broke his arm and I believe a\r\nrib, of how I and Pollack set the limb and nursed him through the fever\r\nthat followed, of how one man after another succumbed to a feverish\r\nmalaria, and how I—by virtue of my scientific reputation—was obliged to\r\nplay the part of doctor and dose them with quinine, and then finding\r\nthat worse than nothing, with rum and small doses of Easton’s Syrup, of\r\nwhich there chanced to be a case of bottles aboard—Heaven and\r\nGordon-Nasmyth know why. For three long days we lay in misery and never\r\nshipped a barrow-load. Then, when they resumed, the men’s hands broke\r\nout into sores. There were no gloves available; and I tried to get\r\nthem, while they shovelled and wheeled, to cover their hands with\r\nstockings or greased rags. They would not do this on account of the\r\nheat and discomfort. This attempt of mine did, however, direct their\r\nattention to the quap as the source of their illness and precipitated\r\nwhat in the end finished our lading, an informal strike. “We’ve had\r\nenough of this,” they said, and they meant it. They came aft to say as\r\nmuch. They cowed the captain.\r\n\r\nThrough all these days the weather was variously vile, first a furnace\r\nheat under a sky of a scowling intensity of blue, then a hot fog that\r\nstuck in one’s throat like wool and turned the men on the planks into\r\ncolourless figures of giants, then a wild burst of thunderstorms, mad\r\nelemental uproar and rain. Through it all, against illness, heat,\r\nconfusion of mind, one master impetus prevailed with me, to keep the\r\nshipping going, to maintain one motif at least, whatever else arose or\r\nceased, the chuff of the spades, the squeaking and shriek of the\r\nbarrows, the pluppa, pluppa, pluppa, as the men came trotting along the\r\nswinging high planks, and then at last, the dollop, dollop, as the\r\nstuff shot into the hold. “Another barrow-load, thank God! Another\r\nfifteen hundred, or it may be two thousand pounds, for the saving of\r\nPonderevo!...”\r\n\r\nI found out many things about myself and humanity in those weeks of\r\neffort behind Mordet Island. I understand now the heart of the sweater,\r\nof the harsh employer, of the nigger-driver. I had brought these men\r\ninto a danger they didn’t understand, I was fiercely resolved to\r\novercome their opposition and bend and use them for my purpose, and I\r\nhated the men. But I hated all humanity during the time that the quap\r\nwas near me.\r\n\r\nAnd my mind was pervaded, too, by a sense of urgency and by the fear\r\nthat we should be discovered and our proceedings stopped. I wanted to\r\nget out to sea again—to be beating up northward with our plunder. I was\r\nafraid our masts showed to seaward and might betray us to some curious\r\npasser on the high sea. And one evening near the end I saw a canoe with\r\nthree natives far off down the lake; I got field-glasses from the\r\ncaptain and scrutinised them, and I could see them staring at us. One\r\nman might have been a half-breed and was dressed in white. They watched\r\nus for some time very quietly and then paddled off into some channel in\r\nthe forest shadows.\r\n\r\nAnd for three nights running, so that it took a painful grip upon my\r\ninflamed imagination, I dreamt of my uncle’s face, only that it was\r\nghastly white like a clown’s, and the throat was cut from ear to ear—a\r\nlong ochreous cut. “Too late,” he said; “Too late!...”\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nA day or so after we had got to work upon the quap I found myself so\r\nsleepless and miserable that the ship became unendurable. Just before\r\nthe rush of sunrise I borrowed Pollack’s gun, walked down the planks,\r\nclambered over the quap heaps and prowled along the beach. I went\r\nperhaps a mile and a half that day and some distance beyond the ruins\r\nof the old station. I became interested in the desolation about me, and\r\nfound when I returned that I was able to sleep for nearly an hour. It\r\nwas delightful to have been alone for so long,—no captain, no Pollack,\r\nno one. Accordingly I repeated this expedition the next morning and the\r\nnext until it became a custom with me. There was little for me to do\r\nonce the digging and wheeling was organised, and so these prowlings of\r\nmine grew longer and longer, and presently I began to take food with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI pushed these walks far beyond the area desolated by the quap. On the\r\nedges of that was first a zone of stunted vegetation, then a sort of\r\nswampy jungle that was difficult to penetrate, and then the beginnings\r\nof the forest, a scene of huge tree stems and tangled creeper ropes and\r\nroots mingled with oozy mud. Here I used to loaf in a state between\r\nbotanising and reverie—always very anxious to know what was up above in\r\nthe sunlight—and here it was I murdered a man.\r\n\r\nIt was the most unmeaning and purposeless murder imaginable. Even as I\r\nwrite down its well-remembered particulars there comes again the sense\r\nof its strangeness, its pointlessness, its incompatibility with any of\r\nthe neat and definite theories people hold about life and the meaning\r\nof the world. I did this thing and I want to tell of my doing it, but\r\nwhy I did it and particularly why I should be held responsible for it I\r\ncannot explain.\r\n\r\nThat morning I had come upon a track in the forest, and it had occurred\r\nto me as a disagreeable idea that this was a human pathway. I didn’t\r\nwant to come upon any human beings. The less our expedition saw of the\r\nAfrican population the better for its prospects. Thus far we had been\r\nsingularly free from native pestering. So I turned back and was making\r\nmy way over mud and roots and dead fronds and petals scattered from the\r\ngreen world above when abruptly I saw my victim.\r\n\r\nI became aware of him perhaps forty feet off standing quite still and\r\nregarding me.\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t by any means a pretty figure. He was very black and naked\r\nexcept for a dirty loin-cloth, his legs were ill-shaped and his toes\r\nspread wide and the upper edge of his cloth and a girdle of string cut\r\nhis clumsy abdomen into folds. His forehead was low, his nose very flat\r\nand his lower lip swollen and purplish-red. His hair was short and\r\nfuzzy, and about his neck was a string and a little purse of skin. He\r\ncarried a musket, and a powder-flask was stuck in his girdle. It was a\r\ncurious confrontation. There opposed to him stood I, a little soiled,\r\nperhaps, but still a rather elaborately civilised human being, born,\r\nbred and trained in a vague tradition. In my hand was an unaccustomed\r\ngun. And each of us was essentially a teeming, vivid brain, tensely\r\nexcited by the encounter, quite unaware of the other’s mental content\r\nor what to do with him.\r\n\r\nHe stepped back a pace or so, stumbled and turned to run.\r\n\r\n“Stop,” I cried; “stop, you fool!” and started to run after him,\r\nshouting such things in English. But I was no match for him over the\r\nroots and mud.\r\n\r\nI had a preposterous idea. “He mustn’t get away and tell them!”\r\n\r\nAnd with that instantly I brought both feet together, raised my gun,\r\naimed quite coolly, drew the trigger carefully and shot him neatly in\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\nI saw, and saw with a leap of pure exaltation, the smash of my bullet\r\nbetween his shoulder blades. “Got him,” said I, dropping my gun and\r\ndown he flopped and died without a groan. “By Jove!” I cried with note\r\nof surprise, “I’ve killed him!” I looked about me and then went forward\r\ncautiously, in a mood between curiosity and astonishment, to look at\r\nthis man whose soul I had flung so unceremoniously out of our common\r\nworld. I went to him, not as one goes to something one has made or\r\ndone, but as one approaches something found.\r\n\r\nHe was frightfully smashed out in front; he must have died in the\r\ninstant. I stooped and raised him by his shoulder and realised that. I\r\ndropped him, and stood about and peered about me through the trees. “My\r\nword!” I said. He was the second dead human being—apart, I mean, from\r\nsurgical properties and mummies and common shows of that sort—that I\r\nhave ever seen. I stood over him wondering, wondering beyond measure.\r\n\r\nA practical idea came into that confusion. Had any one heard the gun?\r\n\r\nI reloaded.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I felt securer, and gave my mind again to the dead I had\r\nkilled. What must I do?\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that perhaps I ought to bury him. At any rate, I\r\nought to hide him. I reflected coolly, and then put my gun within easy\r\nreach and dragged him by the arm towards a place where the mud seemed\r\nsoft, and thrust him in. His powder-flask slipped from his loin-cloth,\r\nand I went back to get it. Then I pressed him down with the butt of my\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nAfterwards this all seemed to me most horrible, but at the time it was\r\nentirely a matter-of-fact transaction. I looked round for any other\r\nvisible evidence of his fate, looked round as one does when one packs\r\none’s portmanteau in an hotel bedroom.\r\n\r\nWhen I got my bearings, and carefully returned towards the ship. I had\r\nthe mood of grave concentration of a boy who has lapsed into poaching.\r\nAnd the business only began to assume proper proportions for me as I\r\ngot near the ship, to seem any other kind of thing than the killing of\r\na bird or rabbit.\r\n\r\nIn the night, however, it took on enormous and portentous forms. “By\r\nGod!” I cried suddenly, starting wide awake; “but it was murder!”\r\n\r\nI lay after that wide awake, staring at my memories. In some odd way\r\nthese visions mixed up with my dream of in my uncle in his despair. The\r\nblack body which saw now damaged and partly buried, but which,\r\nnevertheless, I no longer felt was dead but acutely alive and\r\nperceiving, I mixed up with the ochreous slash under my uncle’s face. I\r\ntried to dismiss this horrible obsession from my mind, but it prevailed\r\nover all my efforts.\r\n\r\nThe next day was utterly black with my sense of that ugly creature’s\r\nbody. I am the least superstitious of men, but it drew me. It drew me\r\nback into those thickets to the very place where I had hidden him.\r\n\r\nSome evil and detestable beast had been at him, and he lay disinterred.\r\n\r\nMethodically I buried his swollen and mangled carcass again, and\r\nreturned to the ship for another night of dreams. Next day for all the\r\nmorning I resisted the impulse to go to him, and played nap with\r\nPollack with my secret gnawing at me, and in the evening started to go\r\nand was near benighted. I never told a soul of them of this thing I had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nNext day I went early, and he had gone, and there were human footmarks\r\nand ugly stains round the muddy hole from which he had been dragged.\r\n\r\nI returned to the ship, disconcerted and perplexed. That day it was the\r\nmen came aft, with blistered hands and faces, and sullen eyes. When\r\nthey proclaimed, through Edwards, their spokesman, “We’ve had enough of\r\nthis, and we mean it,” I answered very readily, “So have I. Let’s go.”\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWe were none too soon. People had been reconnoitring us, the telegraph\r\nhad been at work, and we were not four hours at sea before we ran\r\nagainst the gunboat that had been sent down the coast to look for us\r\nand that would have caught us behind the island like a beast in a trap.\r\nIt was a night of driving cloud that gave intermittent gleams of\r\nmoonlight; the wind and sea were strong and we were rolling along\r\nthrough a drift of rails and mist. Suddenly the world was white with\r\nmoonshine. The gunboat came out as a long dark shape wallowing on the\r\nwater to the east.\r\n\r\nShe sighted the _Maud Mary_ at once, and fired some sort of popgun to\r\narrest us.\r\n\r\nThe mate turned to me.\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell the captain?”\r\n\r\n“The captain be damned” said I, and we let him sleep through two hours\r\nof chase till a rainstorm swallowed us up. Then we changed our course\r\nand sailed right across them, and by morning only her smoke was\r\nshowing.\r\n\r\nWe were clear of Africa—and with the booty aboard I did not see what\r\nstood between us and home.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since I had fallen sick in the Thames my spirits\r\nrose. I was sea-sick and physically disgusted, of course, but I felt\r\nkindly in spite of my qualms. So far as I could calculate then the\r\nsituation was saved. I saw myself returning triumphantly into the\r\nThames, and nothing on earth to prevent old Capern’s Perfect Filament\r\ngoing on the market in fortnight. I had the monopoly of electric lamps\r\nbeneath my feet.\r\n\r\nI was released from the spell of that bloodstained black body all mixed\r\nup with grey-black mud. I was going back to baths and decent food and\r\naeronautics and Beatrice. I was going back to Beatrice and my real life\r\nagain—out of this well into which I had fallen. It would have needed\r\nsomething more than sea-sickness and quap fever to prevent my spirits\r\nrising.\r\n\r\nI told the captain that I agreed with him that the British were the\r\nscum of Europe, the westward drift of all the people, a disgusting\r\nrabble, and I lost three pounds by attenuated retail to Pollack at\r\nha’penny nap and euchre.\r\n\r\nAnd then you know, as we got out into the Atlantic this side of Cape\r\nVerde, the ship began to go to pieces. I don’t pretend for one moment\r\nto understand what happened. But I think Greiffenhagen’s recent work on\r\nthe effects of radium upon ligneous tissue does rather carry out my\r\nidea that emanations from quap have rapid rotting effect upon woody\r\nfibre.\r\n\r\nFrom the first there had been a different feel about the ship, and as\r\nthe big winds and waves began to strain her she commenced leaking. Soon\r\nshe was leaking—not at any particular point, but everywhere. She did\r\nnot spring a leak, I mean, but water came in first of all near the\r\ndecaying edges of her planks, and then through them.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe the water came through the wood. First it began to\r\nooze, then to trickle. It was like trying to carry moist sugar in a\r\nthin paper bag. Soon we were taking in water as though we had opened a\r\ndoor in her bottom.\r\n\r\nOnce it began, the thing went ahead beyond all fighting. For a day or\r\nso we did our best, and I can still remember in my limbs and back the\r\npumping—the fatigue in my arms and the memory of a clear little dribble\r\nof water that jerked as one pumped, and of knocking off and the being\r\nawakened to go on again, and of fatigue piling up upon fatigue. At last\r\nwe ceased to think of anything but pumping; one became a thing of\r\ntorment enchanted, doomed to pump for ever. I still remember it as pure\r\nrelief when at last Pollack came to me pipe in mouth.\r\n\r\n“The captain says the damned thing’s going down right now;” he\r\nremarked, chewing his mouthpiece. “Eh?”\r\n\r\n“Good idea!” I said. “One can’t go on pumping for ever.”\r\n\r\nAnd without hurry or alacrity, sullenly and wearily we got into the\r\nboats and pulled away from the _Maud Mary_ until we were clear of her,\r\nand then we stayed resting on our oars, motionless upon a glassy sea,\r\nwaiting for her to sink. We were all silent, even the captain was\r\nsilent until she went down. And then he spoke quite mildly in an\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n“Dat is the first ship I haf ever lost.... And it was not a fair game!\r\nIt wass not a cargo any man should take. No!”\r\n\r\nI stared at the slow eddies that circled above the departed _Maud\r\nMary_, and the last chance of Business Organisations. I felt weary\r\nbeyond emotion. I thought of my heroics to Beatrice and my uncle, of my\r\nprompt “_I’ll_ go,” and of all the ineffectual months I had spent after\r\nthis headlong decision. I was moved to laughter at myself and fate.\r\n\r\nBut the captain and the men did not laugh. The men scowled at me and\r\nrubbed their sore and blistered hands, and set themselves to row....\r\n\r\nAs all the world knows we were picked up by the Union Castle liner,\r\n_Portland Castle_.\r\n\r\nThe hairdresser aboard was a wonderful man, and he even improvised me a\r\ndress suit, and produced a clean shirt and warm underclothing. I had a\r\nhot bath, and dressed and dined and drank a bottle of Burgundy.\r\n\r\n“Now,” I said, “are there any newspapers? I want to know what’s been\r\nhappening in the world.”\r\n\r\nMy steward gave me what he had, but I landed at Plymouth still largely\r\nignorant of the course of events. I shook off Pollack, and left the\r\ncaptain and mate in an hotel, and the men in a Sailor’s Home until I\r\ncould send to pay them off, and I made my way to the station.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers I bought, the placards I saw, all England indeed\r\nresounded to my uncle’s bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FOURTH\r\nTHE AFTERMATH OF TONO-BUNGAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST\r\nTHE STICK OF THE ROCKET\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThat evening I talked with my uncle in the Hardingham for the last\r\ntime. The atmosphere of the place had altered quite shockingly. Instead\r\nof the crowd of importunate courtiers there were just half a dozen\r\nuninviting men, journalists waiting for an interview. Ropper the big\r\ncommissionaire was still there, but now indeed he was defending my\r\nuncle from something more than time-wasting intrusions. I found the\r\nlittle man alone in the inner office pretending to work, but really\r\nbrooding. He was looking yellow and deflated.\r\n\r\n“Lord!” he said at the sight of me. “You’re lean, George. It makes that\r\nscar of yours show up.”\r\n\r\nWe regarded each other gravely for a time.\r\n\r\n“Quap,” I said, “is at the bottom of the Atlantic. There’s some\r\nbills—We’ve got to pay the men.”\r\n\r\n“Seen the papers?”\r\n\r\n“Read ’em all in the train.”\r\n\r\n“At bay,” he said. “I been at bay for a week.... Yelping round me....\r\nAnd me facing the music. I’m feelin’ a bit tired.”\r\n\r\nHe blew and wiped his glasses.\r\n\r\n“My stomack isn’t what it was,” he explained. “One finds it—these\r\ntimes. How did it all happen, George? Your Marconigram—it took me in\r\nthe wind a bit.”\r\n\r\nI told him concisely. He nodded to the paragraphs of my narrative and\r\nat the end he poured something from a medicine bottle into a sticky\r\nlittle wineglass and drank it. I became aware of the presence of drugs,\r\nof three or four small bottles before him among his disorder of papers,\r\nof a faint elusively familiar odour in the room.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, wiping his lips and recorking the bottle. “You’ve done\r\nyour best, George. The luck’s been against us.”\r\n\r\nHe reflected, bottle in hand. “Sometimes the luck goes with you and\r\nsometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes it doesn’t. And then where are you?\r\nGrass in the oven! Fight or no fight.”\r\n\r\nHe asked a few questions and then his thoughts came back to his own\r\nurgent affairs. I tried to get some comprehensive account of the\r\nsituation from him, but he would not give it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I wish I’d had you. I wish I’d had you, George. I’ve had a lot on\r\nmy hands. You’re clear headed at times.”\r\n\r\n“What has happened?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Boom!—infernal things.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but—how? I’m just off the sea, remember.”\r\n\r\n“It’d worry me too much to tell you now. It’s tied up in a skein.”\r\n\r\nHe muttered something to himself and mused darkly, and roused himself\r\nto say—\r\n\r\n“Besides—you’d better keep out of it. It’s getting tight. Get ’em\r\ntalking. Go down to Crest Hill and fly. That’s _your_ affair.”\r\n\r\nFor a time his manner set free queer anxieties in my brain again.\r\n\r\nI will confess that that Mordet Island nightmare of mine returned, and\r\nas I looked at him his hand went out for the drug again. “Stomach,\r\nGeorge,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I been fightin’ on that. Every man fights on some thing—gives way\r\nsomewheres—head, heart, liver—something. Zzzz. Gives way somewhere.\r\nNapoleon did at last. All through the Waterloo campaign, his stomach—it\r\nwasn’t a stomach! Worse than mine, no end.”\r\n\r\nThe mood of depression passed as the drug worked within him. His eyes\r\nbrightened. He began to talk big. He began to dress up the situation\r\nfor my eyes, to recover what he had admitted to me. He put it as a\r\nretreat from Russia. There were still the chances of Leipzig.\r\n\r\n“It’s a battle, George—a big fight. We’re fighting for millions. I’ve\r\nstill chances. There’s still a card or so. I can’t tell all my\r\nplans—like speaking on the stroke.”\r\n\r\n“You might,” I began.\r\n\r\n“I can’t, George. It’s like asking to look at some embryo. You got to\r\nwait. I know. In a sort of way, I know. But to tell it—No! You been\r\naway so long. And everything’s got complicated.”\r\n\r\nMy perception of disastrous entanglements deepened with the rise of his\r\nspirits. It was evident that I could only help to tie him up in\r\nwhatever net was weaving round his mind by forcing questions and\r\nexplanations upon him. My thoughts flew off at another angle. “How’s\r\nAunt Susan?” said I.\r\n\r\nI had to repeat the question. His busy whispering lips stopped for a\r\nmoment, and he answered in the note of one who repeats a formula.\r\n\r\n“She’d like to be in the battle with me. She’d like to be here in\r\nLondon. But there’s corners I got to turn alone.” His eye rested for a\r\nmoment on the little bottle beside him. “And things have happened.\r\n\r\n“You might go down now and talk to her,” he said, in a directer voice.\r\n“I shall be down to-morrow night, I think.”\r\n\r\nHe looked up as though he hoped that would end our talk.\r\n\r\n“For the week-end?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“For the week-end. Thank God for week-ends, George!”\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMy return home to Lady Grove was a very different thing from what I had\r\nanticipated when I had got out to sea with my load of quap and fancied\r\nthe Perfect-Filament was safe within my grasp. As I walked through the\r\nevening light along the downs, the summer stillness seemed like the\r\nstillness of something newly dead. There were no lurking workmen any\r\nmore, no cyclists on the high road.\r\n\r\nCessation was manifest everywhere. There had been, I learnt from my\r\naunt, a touching and quite voluntary demonstration when the Crest Hill\r\nwork had come to an end and the men had drawn their last pay; they had\r\ncheered my uncle and hooted the contractors and Lord Boom.\r\n\r\nI cannot now recall the manner in which my aunt and I greeted one\r\nanother. I must have been very tired there, but whatever impression was\r\nmade has gone out of my memory. But I recall very clearly how we sat at\r\nthe little round table near the big window that gave on the terrace,\r\nand dined and talked. I remember her talking of my uncle.\r\n\r\nShe asked after him, and whether he seemed well. “I wish I could help,”\r\nshe said. “But I’ve never helped him much, never. His way of doing\r\nthings was never mine. And since—since—. Since he began to get so rich,\r\nhe’s kept things from me. In the old days—it was different....\r\n\r\n“There he is—I don’t know what he’s doing. He won’t have me near\r\nhim....\r\n\r\n“More’s kept from me than anyone. The very servants won’t let me know.\r\nThey try and stop the worst of the papers—Boom’s things—from coming\r\nupstairs.... I suppose they’ve got him in a corner, George. Poor old\r\nTeddy! Poor old Adam and Eve we are! Ficial Receivers with flaming\r\nswords to drive us out of our garden! I’d hoped we’d never have another\r\nTrek. Well—anyway, it won’t be Crest Hill.... But it’s hard on Teddy.\r\nHe must be in such a mess up there. Poor old chap. I suppose we can’t\r\nhelp him. I suppose we’d only worry him. Have some more soup\r\nGeorge—while there is some?...”\r\n\r\nThe next day was one of those days of strong perception that stand out\r\nclear in one’s memory when the common course of days is blurred. I can\r\nrecall now the awakening in the large familiar room that was always\r\nkept for me, and how I lay staring at its chintz-covered chairs, its\r\nspaced fine furniture, its glimpse of the cedars without, and thought\r\nthat all this had to end.\r\n\r\nI have never been greedy for money, I have never wanted to be rich, but\r\nI felt now an immense sense of impending deprivation. I read the\r\nnewspapers after breakfast—I and my aunt together—and then I walked up\r\nto see what Cothope had done in the matter of Lord Roberts β. Never\r\nbefore had I appreciated so acutely the ample brightness of the Lady\r\nGrove gardens, the dignity and wide peace of all about me. It was one\r\nof those warm mornings in late May that have won all the glory of\r\nsummer without losing the gay delicacy of spring. The shrubbery was\r\nbright with laburnum and lilac, the beds swarmed with daffodils and\r\nnarcissi and with lilies of the valley in the shade.\r\n\r\nI went along the well-kept paths among the rhododendra and through the\r\nprivate gate into the woods where the bluebells and common orchid were\r\nin profusion. Never before had I tasted so completely the fine sense of\r\nprivilege and ownership. And all this has to end, I told myself, all\r\nthis has to end.\r\n\r\nNeither my uncle nor I had made any provision for disaster; all we had\r\nwas in the game, and I had little doubt now of the completeness of our\r\nruin. For the first time in my life since he had sent me that wonderful\r\ntelegram of his I had to consider that common anxiety of\r\nmankind,—Employment. I had to come off my magic carpet and walk once\r\nmore in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly I found myself at the cross drives where I had seen\r\nBeatrice for the first time after so many years. It is strange, but so\r\nfar as I can recollect I had not thought of her once since I had landed\r\nat Plymouth. No doubt she had filled the background of my mind, but I\r\ndo not remember one definite, clear thought. I had been intent on my\r\nuncle and the financial collapse.\r\n\r\nIt came like a blow in the face now; all that, too, had to end!\r\n\r\nSuddenly I was filled with the thought of her and a great longing for\r\nher. What would she do when she realised our immense disaster? What\r\nwould she do? How would she take it? It filled me with astonishment to\r\nrealise how little I could tell....\r\n\r\nShould I perhaps presently happen upon her?\r\n\r\nI went on through the plantations and out upon the downs, and thence I\r\nsaw Cothope with a new glider of his own design soaring down wind to my\r\nold familiar “grounding” place. To judge by its long rhythm it was a\r\nvery good glider. “Like Cothope’s cheek,” thought I, “to go on with the\r\nresearch. I wonder if he’s keeping notes.... But all this will have to\r\nstop.”\r\n\r\nHe was sincerely glad to see me. “It’s been a rum go,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe had been there without wages for a month, a man forgotten in the\r\nrush of events.\r\n\r\n“I just stuck on and did what I could with the stuff. I got a bit of\r\nmoney of my own—and I said to myself, ‘Well, here you are with the gear\r\nand no one to look after you. You won’t get such a chance again, my\r\nboy, not in all your born days. Why not make what you can with it? ‘”\r\n\r\n“How’s Lord Roberts β?”\r\n\r\nCothope lifted his eyebrows. “I’ve had to refrain,” he said. “But he’s\r\nlooking very handsome.”\r\n\r\n“Gods!” I said, “I’d like to get him up just once before we smash. You\r\nread the papers? You know we’re going to smash?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I read the papers. It’s scandalous, sir, such work as ours should\r\ndepend on things like that. You and I ought to be under the State, sir,\r\nif you’ll excuse me.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing to excuse,” I said. “I’ve always been a Socialist—of a sort—in\r\ntheory. Let’s go and have a look at him. How is he? Deflated?”\r\n\r\n“Just about quarter full. That last oil glaze of yours holds the gas\r\nsomething beautiful. He’s not lost a cubic metre a week.”...\r\n\r\nCothope returned to Socialism as we went toward the sheds.\r\n\r\n“Glad to think you’re a Socialist, sir,” he said, “it’s the only\r\ncivilised state. I been a Socialist some years—off the _Clarion_. It’s\r\na rotten scramble, this world. It takes the things we make and invent\r\nand it plays the silly fool with ’em. We scientific people, we’ll have\r\nto take things over and stop all this financing and advertisement and\r\nthat. It’s too silly. It’s a noosance. Look at us!”\r\n\r\nLord Roberts _B_, even in his partially deflated condition in his shed,\r\nwas a fine thing to stare up at. I stood side by side with Cothope\r\nregarding him, and it was borne in upon me more acutely than ever that\r\nall this had to end. I had a feeling just like the feeling of a boy who\r\nwants to do wrong, that I would use up the stuff while I had it before\r\nthe creditors descended. I had a queer fancy, too, I remember, that if\r\nI could get into the air it would advertise my return to Beatrice.\r\n\r\n“We’ll fill her,” I said concisely.\r\n\r\n“It’s all ready,” said Cothope, and added as an afterthought, “unless\r\nthey cut off the gas.”...\r\n\r\nI worked and interested myself with Cothope all the morning and for a\r\ntime forgot my other troubles. But the thought of Beatrice flooded me\r\nslowly and steadily. It became an unintelligent sick longing to see\r\nher. I felt that I could not wait for the filling of Lord Roberts β,\r\nthat I must hunt her up and see her soon. I got everything forward and\r\nlunched with Cothope, and then with the feeblest excuses left him in\r\norder to prowl down through the woods towards Bedley Corner. I became a\r\nprey to wretched hesitations and diffidence. Ought I to go near her\r\nnow? I asked myself, reviewing all the social abasements of my early\r\nyears. At last, about five, I called at the Dower House. I was greeted\r\nby their Charlotte—with a forbidding eye and a cold astonishment.\r\n\r\nBoth Beatrice and Lady Osprey were out.\r\n\r\nThere came into my head some prowling dream of meeting her. I went\r\nalong the lane towards Woking, the lane down which we had walked five\r\nmonths ago in the wind and rain.\r\n\r\nI mooned for a time in our former footsteps, then swore and turned back\r\nacross the fields, and then conceived a distaste for Cothope and went\r\nDownward. At last I found myself looking down on the huge abandoned\r\nmasses of the Crest Hill house.\r\n\r\nThat gave my mind a twist into a new channel. My uncle came uppermost\r\nagain. What a strange, melancholy emptiness of intention that stricken\r\nenterprise seemed in the even evening sunlight, what vulgar\r\nmagnificence and crudity and utter absurdity! It was as idiotic as the\r\npyramids. I sat down on the stile, staring at it as though I had never\r\nseen that forest of scaffold poles, that waste of walls and bricks and\r\nplaster and shaped stones, that wilderness of broken soil and wheeling\r\ntracks and dumps before. It struck me suddenly as the compactest image\r\nand sample of all that passes for Progress, of all the\r\nadvertisement-inflated spending, the aimless building up and pulling\r\ndown, the enterprise and promise of my age. This was our fruit, this\r\nwas what he had done, I and my uncle, in the fashion of our time. We\r\nwere its leaders and exponents, we were the thing it most flourishingly\r\nproduced. For this futility in its end, for an epoch of such futility,\r\nthe solemn scroll of history had unfolded....\r\n\r\n“Great God!” I cried, “but is this Life?”\r\n\r\nFor this the armies drilled, for this the Law was administered and the\r\nprisons did their duty, for this the millions toiled and perished in\r\nsuffering, in order that a few of us should build palaces we never\r\nfinished, make billiard-rooms under ponds, run imbecile walls round\r\nirrational estates, scorch about the world in motor-cars, devise\r\nflying-machines, play golf and a dozen such foolish games of ball,\r\ncrowd into chattering dinner parties, gamble and make our lives one\r\nvast, dismal spectacle of witless waste! So it struck me then, and for\r\na time I could think of no other interpretation. This was Life! It came\r\nto me like a revelation, a revelation at once incredible and\r\nindisputable of the abysmal folly of our being.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nI was roused from such thoughts by the sound of footsteps behind me.\r\n\r\nI turned half hopeful—so foolish is a lover’s imagination, and stopped\r\namazed. It was my uncle. His face was white—white as I had seen it in\r\nmy dream.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” I said, and stared. “Why aren’t you in London?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all up,” he said....\r\n\r\n“Adjudicated?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\nI stared at him for a moment, and then got off the stile.\r\n\r\nWe stood swaying and then came forward with a weak motion of his arms\r\nlike a man who cannot see distinctly, and caught at and leant upon the\r\nstile. For a moment we were absolutely still. He made a clumsy gesture\r\ntowards the great futility below and choked. I discovered that his face\r\nwas wet with tears, that his wet glasses blinded him. He put up his\r\nlittle fat hand and clawed them off clumsily, felt inefficiently for\r\nhis pocket-handkerchief, and then, to my horror, as he clung to me, he\r\nbegan to weep aloud, this little, old worldworn swindler. It wasn’t\r\njust sobbing or shedding tears, it was crying as a child cries. It was\r\noh! terrible!\r\n\r\n“It’s cruel,” he blubbered at last. “They asked me questions. They\r\n_kep_’ asking me questions, George.”\r\n\r\nHe sought for utterance, and spluttered.\r\n\r\n“The Bloody bullies!” he shouted. “The Bloody Bullies.”\r\n\r\nHe ceased to weep. He became suddenly rapid and explanatory.\r\n\r\n“It’s not a fair game, George. They tire you out. And I’m not well. My\r\nstomach’s all wrong. And I been and got a cold. I always been li’ble to\r\ncold, and this one’s on my chest. And then they tell you to speak up.\r\nThey bait you—and bait you, and bait you. It’s torture. The strain of\r\nit. You can’t remember what you said. You’re bound to contradict\r\nyourself. It’s like Russia, George.... It isn’t fair play.... Prominent\r\nman. I’ve been next at dinners with that chap, Neal; I’ve told him\r\nstories—and he’s bitter! Sets out to ruin me. Don’t ask a civil\r\nquestion—bellows.” He broke down again. “I’ve been bellowed at, I been\r\nbullied, I been treated like a dog. Dirty cads they are! Dirty cads!\r\nI’d rather be a Three-Card Sharper than a barrister; I’d rather sell\r\ncat’s-meat in the streets.\r\n\r\n“They sprung things on me this morning, things I didn’t expect. They\r\nrushed me! I’d got it all in my hands and then I was jumped. By Neal!\r\nNeal I’ve given city tips to! Neal! I’ve helped Neal....\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t swallow a mouthful—not in the lunch hour. I couldn’t face\r\nit. It’s true, George—I couldn’t face it. I said I’d get a bit of air\r\nand slipped out and down to the Embankment, and there I took a boat to\r\nRichmond. Some idee. I took a rowing boat when I got there and I rowed\r\nabout on the river for a bit. A lot of chaps and girls there was on the\r\nbank laughed at my shirt-sleeves and top hat. Dessay they thought it\r\nwas a pleasure trip. Fat lot of pleasure! I rowed round for a bit and\r\ncame in. Then I came on here. Windsor way. And there they are in London\r\ndoing what they like with me.... I don’t care!”\r\n\r\n“But” I said, looking down at him, perplexed.\r\n\r\n“It’s abscondin’. They’ll have a warrant.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It’s all up, George—all up and over.\r\n\r\n“And I thought I’d live in that place, George and die a lord! It’s a\r\ngreat place, reely, an imperial—if anyone has the sense to buy it and\r\nfinish it. That terrace—”\r\n\r\nI stood thinking him over.\r\n\r\n“Look here!” I said. “What’s that about—a warrant? Are you sure they’ll\r\nget a warrant? I’m sorry uncle; but what have you done?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t I told you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they won’t do very much to you for that. They’ll only bring\r\nyou up for the rest of your examination.”\r\n\r\nHe remained silent for a time. At last he spoke—speaking with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n“It’s worse than that. I’ve done something. They’re bound to get it\r\nout. Practically they _have_ got it out.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Writin’ things down—I done something.”\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life, I believe, he felt and looked ashamed.\r\nIt filled me with remorse to see him suffer so.\r\n\r\n“We’ve all done things,” I said. “It’s part of the game the world makes\r\nus play. If they want to arrest you—and you’ve got no cards in your\r\nhand—! They mustn’t arrest you.”\r\n\r\n“No. That’s partly why I went to Richmond. But I never thought—”\r\n\r\nHis little bloodshot eyes stared at Crest Hill.\r\n\r\n“That chap Wittaker Wright,” he said, “he had his stuff ready. I\r\nhaven’t. Now you got it, George. That’s the sort of hole I’m in.”\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThat memory of my uncle at the gate is very clear and full. I am able\r\nto recall even the undertow of my thoughts while he was speaking. I\r\nremember my pity and affection for him in his misery growing and\r\nstirring within me, my realisation that at any risk I must help him.\r\nBut then comes indistinctness again. I was beginning to act. I know I\r\npersuaded him to put himself in my hands, and began at once to plan and\r\ndo. I think that when we act most we remember least, that just in the\r\nmeasure that the impulse of our impressions translates itself into\r\nschemes and movements, it ceases to record itself in memories. I know I\r\nresolved to get him away at once, and to use the Lord Roberts β in\r\neffecting that. It was clear he was soon to be a hunted man, and it\r\nseemed to me already unsafe for him to try the ordinary Continental\r\nroutes in his flight. I had to evolve some scheme, and evolve it\r\nrapidly, how we might drop most inconspicuously into the world across\r\nthe water. My resolve to have one flight at least in my airship fitted\r\nwith this like hand to glove. It seemed to me we might be able to cross\r\nover the water in the night, set our airship adrift, and turn up as\r\npedestrian tourists in Normandy or Brittany, and so get away. That, at\r\nany rate, was my ruling idea.\r\n\r\nI sent off Cothope with a dummy note to Woking, because I did not want\r\nto implicate him, and took my uncle to the pavilion. I went down to my\r\naunt, and made a clean breast of the situation. She became admirably\r\ncompetent. We went into his dressing-room and ruthlessly broke his\r\nlocks. I got a pair of brown boots, a tweed suit and a cap of his, and\r\nindeed a plausible walking outfit, and a little game bag for his\r\npedestrian gear; and, in addition, a big motoring overcoat and a supply\r\nof rugs to add to those I had at the pavilion. I also got a flask of\r\nbrandy, and she made sandwiches. I don’t remember any servants\r\nappearing, and I forget where she got those sandwiches. Meanwhile we\r\ntalked. Afterwards I thought with what a sure confidence we talked to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n“What’s he done?” she said.\r\n\r\n“D’you mind knowing?”\r\n\r\n“No conscience left, thank God!”\r\n\r\n“I think—forgery!”\r\n\r\nThere was just a little pause. “Can you carry this bundle?” she asked.\r\n\r\nI lifted it.\r\n\r\n“No woman ever has respected the law—ever,” she said. “It’s too\r\nsilly.... The things it lets you do! And then pulls you up—like a mad\r\nnurse minding a child.”\r\n\r\nShe carried some rugs for me through the shrubbery in the darkling.\r\n\r\n“They’ll think we’re going mooning,” she said, jerking her head at the\r\nhousehold. “I wonder what they make of us—criminals.” ... An immense\r\ndroning note came as if in answer to that. It startled us both for a\r\nmoment. “The dears!” she said. “It’s the gong for dinner!... But I wish\r\nI could help little Teddy, George. It’s awful to think of him there\r\nwith hot eyes, red and dry. And I know—the sight of me makes him feel\r\nsore. Things I said, George. If I could have seen, I’d have let him\r\nhave an omnibusful of Scrymgeours. I cut him up. He’d never thought I\r\nmeant it before.... I’ll help all I can, anyhow.”\r\n\r\nI turned at something in her voice, and got a moon light gleam of tears\r\nupon her face.\r\n\r\n“Could _she_ have helped?” she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n“_She?_”\r\n\r\n“That woman.”\r\n\r\n“My God!” I cried, “_helped!_ Those—things don’t help!”\r\n\r\n“Tell me again what I ought to do,” she said after a silence.\r\n\r\nI went over the plans I had made for communicating, and the things I\r\nthought she might do. I had given her the address of a solicitor she\r\nmight put some trust in.\r\n\r\n“But you must act for yourself,” I insisted.\r\n\r\n“Roughly,” I said, “it’s a scramble. You must get what you can for us,\r\nand follow as you can.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\nShe came right up to the pavilion and hovered for a time shyly, and\r\nthen went away.\r\n\r\nI found my uncle in my sitting-room in an arm-chair, with his feet upon\r\nthe fender of the gas stove, which he had lit, and now he was feebly\r\ndrunken with my whisky, and very weary in body and spirit, and inclined\r\nto be cowardly.\r\n\r\n“I lef’ my drops,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe changed his clothes slowly and unwillingly. I had to bully him, I\r\nhad almost to shove him to the airship and tuck him up upon its wicker\r\nflat. Single-handed I made but a clumsy start; we scraped along the\r\nroof of the shed and bent a van of the propeller, and for a time I hung\r\nunderneath without his offering a hand to help me to clamber up. If it\r\nhadn’t been for a sort of anchoring trolley device of Cothope’s, a sort\r\nof slip anchor running on a rail, we should never have got clear at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe incidents of our flight in Lord Roberts β do not arrange themselves\r\nin any consecutive order. To think of that adventure is like dipping\r\nhaphazard into an album of views. One is reminded first of this and\r\nthen of that. We were both lying down on a horizontal plate of\r\nbasketwork; for Lord Roberts β had none of the elegant accommodation of\r\na balloon. I lay forward, and my uncle behind me in such a position\r\nthat he could see hardly anything of our flight. We were protected from\r\nrolling over simply by netting between the steel stays. It was\r\nimpossible for us to stand up at all; we had either to lie or crawl on\r\nall fours over the basket work. Amidships were lockers made of Watson’s\r\nAulite material,—and between these it was that I had put my uncle,\r\nwrapped in rugs. I wore sealskin motoring boots and gloves, and a\r\nmotoring fur coat over my tweeds, and I controlled the engine by Bowden\r\nwires and levers forward.\r\n\r\nThe early part of that night’s experience was made up of warmth, of\r\nmoonlit Surrey and Sussex landscape, and of a rapid and successful\r\nflight, ascending and swooping, and then ascending again southward. I\r\ncould not watch the clouds because the airship overhung me; I could not\r\nsee the stars nor gauge the meteorological happening, but it was fairly\r\nclear to me that a wind shifting between north and northeast was\r\ngathering strength, and after I had satisfied myself by a series of\r\nentirely successful expansions and contractions of the real\r\nair-worthiness of Lord Roberts β, I stopped the engine to save my\r\npetrol, and let the monster drift, checking its progress by the dim\r\nlandscape below. My uncle lay quite still behind me, saying little and\r\nstaring in front of him, and I was left to my own thoughts and\r\nsensations.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts, whatever they were, have long since faded out of memory,\r\nand my sensations have merged into one continuous memory of an\r\ncountryside lying, as it seemed, under snow, with square patches of\r\ndimness, white phantoms of roads, rents and pools of velvety blackness,\r\nand lamp-jewelled houses. I remember a train boring its way like a\r\nhastening caterpillar of fire across the landscape, and how distinctly\r\nI heard its clatter. Every town and street was buttoned with street\r\nlamps. I came quite close to the South Downs near Lewes, and all the\r\nlights were out in the houses, and the people gone to bed. We left the\r\nland a little to the east of Brighton, and by that time Brighton was\r\nwell abed. and the brightly lit sea-front deserted. Then I let out the\r\ngas chamber to its fullest extent and rose. I like to be high above\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nI do not clearly know what happened in the night. I think I must have\r\ndozed, and probably my uncle slept. I remember that once or twice I\r\nheard him talking in an eager, muffled voice to himself, or to an\r\nimaginary court. But there can be no doubt the wind changed right round\r\ninto the east, and that we were carried far down the Channel without\r\nany suspicion of the immense leeway we were making. I remember the kind\r\nof stupid perplexity with which I saw the dawn breaking over a grey\r\nwaste of water, below, and realised that something was wrong. I was so\r\nstupid that it was only after the sunrise I really noticed the trend of\r\nthe foam caps below, and perceived we were in a severe easterly gale.\r\nEven then, instead of heading southeasterly, I set the engine going,\r\nheaded south, and so continued a course that must needs have either\r\njust hit Ushant, or carry us over the Bay of Biscay. I thought I was\r\neast of Cherbourg, when I was far to the west and stopped my engine in\r\nthat belief, and then set it going again. I did actually sight the\r\ncoast of Brittany to the southeast in the late afternoon, and that it\r\nwas woke me up to the gravity of our position. I discovered it by\r\naccident in the southeast, when I was looking for it in the southwest.\r\nI turned about east and faced the wind for some time, and finding I had\r\nno chance in its teeth, went high, where it seemed less violent, and\r\ntried to make a course southeast. It was only then that I realised what\r\na gale I was in. I had been going westward, and perhaps even in gusts\r\nnorth of west, at a pace of fifty or sixty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThen I began what I suppose would be called a Fight against the east\r\nwind. One calls it a Fight, but it was really almost as unlike a fight\r\nas plain sewing. The wind tried to drive me westwardly, and I tried to\r\nget as much as I could eastwardly, with the wind beating and rocking us\r\nirregularly, but by no means unbearably, for about twelve hours. My\r\nhope lay in the wind abating, and our keeping in the air and eastward\r\nof Finisterre until it did, and the chief danger was the exhaustion of\r\nour petrol. It was a long and anxious and almost meditative time; we\r\nwere fairly warm, and only slowly getting hungry, and except that my\r\nuncle grumbled a little and produced some philosophical reflections,\r\nand began to fuss about having a temperature, we talked very little. I\r\nwas tired and sulky, and chiefly worried about the engine. I had to\r\nresist a tendency to crawl back and look at it. I did not care to risk\r\ncontracting our gas chamber for fear of losing gas. Nothing was less\r\nlike a fight. I know that in popular magazines, and so forth, all such\r\noccasions as this are depicted in terms of hysteria. Captains save\r\ntheir ships engineers complete their bridges, generals conduct their\r\nbattles, in a state of dancing excitement, foaming recondite\r\ntechnicalities at the lips. I suppose that sort of thing works up the\r\nreader, but so far as it professes to represent reality, I am convinced\r\nit is all childish nonsense, schoolboys of fifteen, girls of eighteen,\r\nand literary men all their lives, may have these squealing fits, but my\r\nown experience is that most exciting scenes are not exciting, and most\r\nof the urgent moments in life are met by steady-headed men.\r\n\r\nNeither I nor my uncle spent the night in ejaculations, nor in humorous\r\nallusions, nor any of these things. We remained lumpish.\r\n\r\nMy uncle stuck in his place and grumbled about his stomach, and\r\noccasionally rambled off into expositions of his financial position and\r\ndenunciations of Neal—he certainly struck out one or two good phrases\r\nfor Neal—and I crawled about at rare intervals in a vague sort of way\r\nand grunted, and our basketwork creaked continually, and the wind on\r\nour quarter made a sort of ruffled flapping in the wall of the gas\r\nchamber. For all our wraps we got frightfully cold as the night wore\r\non.\r\n\r\nI must have dozed, and it was still dark when I realised with a start\r\nthat we were nearly due south of, and a long way from, a\r\nregularly-flashing lighthouse, standing out before the glow of some\r\ngreat town, and then that the thing that had awakened me was the\r\ncessation of our engine, and that we were driving back to the west.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, for a time I felt the grim thrill of life. I crawled\r\nforward to the cords of the release valves, made my uncle crawl forward\r\ntoo, and let out the gas until we were falling down through the air\r\nlike a clumsy glider towards the vague greyness that was land.\r\n\r\nSomething must have intervened here that I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nI saw the lights of Bordeaux when it was quite dark, a nebulous haze\r\nagainst black; of that I am reasonably sure. But certainly our fall\r\ntook place in the cold, uncertain light of early dawn. I am, at least,\r\nequally sure of that. And Mimizan, near where we dropped, is fifty\r\nmiles from Bordeaux, whose harbour lights I must have seen.\r\n\r\nI remember coming down at last with a curious indifference, and\r\nactually rousing myself to steer. But the actual coming to earth was\r\nexciting enough. I remember our prolonged dragging landfall, and the\r\ndifficulty I had to get clear, and how a gust of wind caught Lord\r\nRoberts B as my uncle stumbled away from the ropes and litter, and\r\ndropped me heavily, and threw me on to my knees. Then came the\r\nrealisation that the monster was almost consciously disentangling\r\nitself for escape, and then the light leap of its rebound. The rope\r\nslipped out of reach of my hand. I remember running knee-deep in a salt\r\npool in hopeless pursuit of the airship.\r\n\r\nAs it dragged and rose seaward, and how only after it had escaped my\r\nuttermost effort to recapture it, did I realise that this was quite the\r\nbest thing that could have happened. It drove swiftly over the sandy\r\ndunes, lifting and falling, and was hidden by a clump of windbitten\r\ntrees. Then it reappeared much further off, and still receding. It\r\nsoared for a time, and sank slowly, and after that I saw it no more. I\r\nsuppose it fell into the sea and got wetted with salt water and heavy,\r\nand so became deflated and sank.\r\n\r\nIt was never found, and there was never a report of anyone seeing it\r\nafter it escaped from me.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nBut if I find it hard to tell the story of our long flight through the\r\nair overseas, at least that dawn in France stands cold and clear and\r\nfull. I see again almost as if I saw once more with my bodily eyes the\r\nridges of sand rising behind ridges of sand, grey and cold and\r\nblack-browed, with an insufficient grass. I feel again the clear, cold\r\nchill of dawn, and hear the distant barking of a dog. I find myself\r\nasking again, “What shall we do now?” and trying to scheme with brain\r\ntired beyond measure.\r\n\r\nAt first my uncle occupied my attention. He was shivering a good deal,\r\nand it was all I could do to resist my desire to get him into a\r\ncomfortable bed at once. But I wanted to appear plausibly in this part\r\nof the world. I felt it would not do to turn up anywhere at dawn and\r\nrest, it would be altogether too conspicuous; we must rest until the\r\nday was well advanced, and then appear as road-stained pedestrians\r\nseeking a meal. I gave him most of what was left of the biscuits,\r\nemptied our flasks, and advised him to sleep, but at first it was too\r\ncold, albeit I wrapped the big fur rug around him.\r\n\r\nI was struck now by the flushed weariness of his face, and the look of\r\nage the grey stubble on his unshaved chin gave him. He sat crumpled up,\r\nshivering and coughing, munching reluctantly, but drinking eagerly, and\r\nwhimpering a little, a dreadfully pitiful figure to me. But we had to\r\ngo through with it; there was no way out for us.\r\n\r\nPresently the sun rose over the pines, and the sand grew rapidly warm.\r\nMy uncle had done eating, and sat with his wrists resting on his knees,\r\nthe most hopeless looking of lost souls.\r\n\r\n“I’m ill,” he said, “I’m damnably ill! I can feel it in my skin!”\r\n\r\nThen—it was horrible to me—he cried, “I ought to be in bed; I ought to\r\nbe in bed... instead of flying about,” and suddenly he burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nI stood up. “Go to sleep, man!” I said, and took the rug from him, and\r\nspread it out and rolled him up in it.\r\n\r\n“It’s all very well,” he protested; “I’m not young enough—”\r\n\r\n“Lift up your head,” I interrupted, and put his knapsack under it.\r\n\r\n“They’ll catch us here, just as much as in an inn,” he grumbled and\r\nthen lay still.\r\n\r\nPresently, after a long time, I perceived he was asleep. His breath\r\ncame with peculiar wheezings, and every now and again he would cough. I\r\nwas very stiff and tired myself, and perhaps I dozed. I don’t remember.\r\nI remember only sitting, as it seemed, nigh interminably, beside him,\r\ntoo weary even to think in that sandy desolation.\r\n\r\nNo one came near us; no creature, not even a dog. I roused myself at\r\nlast, feeling that it was vain to seek to seem other than abnormal, and\r\nwith an effort that was like lifting a sky of lead, we made our way\r\nthrough the wearisome sand to a farmhouse. There I feigned even a more\r\ninsufficient French than I possess naturally, and let it appear that we\r\nwere pedestrians from Biarritz who had lost our way along the shore and\r\ngot benighted.\r\n\r\nThis explained us pretty well, I thought, and we got most heartening\r\ncoffee and a cart to a little roadside station. My uncle grew more and\r\nmore manifestly ill with every stage of our journey. I got him to\r\nBayonne, where he refused at first to eat, and was afterwards very\r\nsick, and then took him shivering and collapsed up a little branch line\r\nto a frontier place called Luzon Gare.\r\n\r\nWe found one homely inn with two small bedrooms, kept by a kindly\r\nBasque woman. I got him to bed, and that night shared his room, and\r\nafter an hour or so of sleep he woke up in a raging fever and with a\r\nwandering mind, cursing Neal and repeating long, inaccurate lists of\r\nfigures. He was manifestly a case for a doctor, and in the morning we\r\ngot one in. He was a young man from Montpelier, just beginning to\r\npractise, and very mysterious and technical and modern and unhelpful.\r\nHe spoke of cold and exposure, and _la grippe_ and pneumonia. He gave\r\nmany explicit and difficult directions.... I perceived it devolved upon\r\nme to organise nursing and a sick-room. I installed a _religieuse_ in\r\nthe second bedroom of the inn, and took a room for myself in the inn of\r\nPort de Luzon, a quarter of a mile away.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAnd now my story converges on what, in that queer corner of refuge out\r\nof the world, was destined to be my uncle’s deathbed. There is a\r\nbackground of the Pyrenees, of blue hills and sunlit houses, of the old\r\ncastle of Luzon and a noisy cascading river, and for a foreground the\r\ndim, stuffy room whose windows both the _religieuse_ and hostess\r\nconspired to shut, with its waxed floor, its four-poster bed, its\r\ncharacteristically French chairs and fireplace, its champagne bottles\r\nand dirty basins and used towels and packets of _Somatosé_ on the\r\ntable. And in the sickly air of the confined space in behind the\r\ncurtains of the bed lay my little uncle, with an effect of being\r\nenthroned and secluded, or sat up, or writhed and tossed in his last\r\ndealings of life. One went and drew back the edge of the curtains if\r\none wanted to speak to him or look at him.\r\n\r\nUsually he was propped up against pillows, because so he breathed more\r\neasily. He slept hardly at all.\r\n\r\nI have a confused memory of vigils and mornings and afternoons spent by\r\nthat bedside, and how the _religieuse_ hovered about me, and how meek\r\nand good and inefficient she was, and how horribly black were her\r\nnails. Other figures come and go, and particularly the doctor, a young\r\nman plumply rococo, in bicycling dress, with fine waxen features, a\r\nlittle pointed beard, and the long black frizzy hair and huge tie of a\r\nminor poet. Bright and clear-cut and irrelevant are memories of the\r\nBasque hostess of my uncle’s inn and of the family of Spanish people\r\nwho entertained me and prepared the most amazingly elaborate meals for\r\nme, with soup and salad and chicken and remarkable sweets. They were\r\nall very kind and sympathetic people, systematically so. And\r\nconstantly, without attracting attention, I was trying to get\r\nnewspapers from home.\r\n\r\nMy uncle is central to all these impressions.\r\n\r\nI have tried to make you picture him, time after time, as the young man\r\nof the Wimblehurst chemist’s shop, as the shabby assistant in Tottenham\r\nCourt Road, as the adventurer of the early days of Tono-Bungay, as the\r\nconfident, preposterous plutocrat. And now I have to tell of him\r\nstrangely changed under the shadow of oncoming death, with his skin lax\r\nand yellow and glistening with sweat, his eyes large and glassy, his\r\ncountenance unfamiliar through the growth of a beard, his nose pinched\r\nand thin. Never had he looked so small as now. And he talked to me in a\r\nwhispering, strained voice of great issues, of why his life had been,\r\nand whither he was going. Poor little man! that last phase is, as it\r\nwere, disconnected from all the other phases. It was as if he crawled\r\nout from the ruins of his career, and looked about him before he died.\r\nFor he had quite clear-minded states in the intervals of his delirium.\r\n\r\nHe knew he was almost certainly dying. In a way that took the burthen\r\nof his cares off his mind. There was no more Neal to face, no more\r\nflights or evasions, no punishments.\r\n\r\n“It has been a great career, George,” he said, “but I shall be glad to\r\nrest. Glad to rest!... Glad to rest.”\r\n\r\nHis mind ran rather upon his career, and usually, I am glad to recall,\r\nwith a note of satisfaction and approval. In his delirious phases he\r\nwould most often exaggerate this self-satisfaction, and talk of his\r\nsplendours. He would pluck at the sheet and stare before him, and\r\nwhisper half-audible fragments of sentences.\r\n\r\n“What is this great place, these cloud-capped towers, these any\r\npinnacles?... Ilion. Sky-pointing.... Ilion House, the residence of one\r\nof our great merchant princes.... Terrace above terrace. Reaching to\r\nthe heavens.... Kingdoms Cæsar never knew.... A great poet, George.\r\nZzzz. Kingdoms Cæsar never knew.... Under entirely new management.\r\n\r\n“Greatness....Millions... Universities.... He stands on the terrace—on\r\nthe upper terrace—directing—directing—by the globe—directing—the\r\ntrade.”\r\n\r\nIt was hard at times to tell when his sane talk ceased and his delirium\r\nbegan. The secret springs of his life, the vain imaginations were\r\nrevealed. I sometimes think that all the life of man sprawls abed,\r\ncareless and unkempt, until it must needs clothe and wash itself and\r\ncome forth seemly in act and speech for the encounter with one’s\r\nfellow-men. I suspect that all things unspoken in our souls partake\r\nsomewhat of the laxity of delirium and dementia. Certainly from those\r\nslimy, tormented lips above the bristling grey beard came nothing but\r\ndreams and disconnected fancies....\r\n\r\nSometimes he raved about Neal, threatened Neal. “What has he got\r\ninvested?” he said. “Does he think he can escape me?... If I followed\r\nhim up.... Ruin. Ruin.... One would think _I_ had taken his money.”\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes he reverted to our airship flight. “It’s too long,\r\nGeorge, too long and too cold. I’m too old a man—too old—for this sort\r\nof thing.... You know you’re not saving—you’re killing me.”\r\n\r\nTowards the end it became evident our identity was discovered. I found\r\nthe press, and especially Boom’s section of it, had made a sort of hue\r\nand cry for us, sent special commissioners to hunt for us, and though\r\nnone of these emissaries reached us until my uncle was dead, one felt\r\nthe forewash of that storm of energy. The thing got into the popular\r\nFrench press. People became curious in their manner towards us, and a\r\nnumber of fresh faces appeared about the weak little struggle that went\r\non in the closeness behind the curtains of the bed. The young doctor\r\ninsisted on consultations, and a motor-car came up from Biarritz, and\r\nsuddenly odd people with questioning eyes began to poke in with\r\ninquiries and help. Though nothing was said, I could feel that we were\r\nno longer regarded as simple middle-class tourists; about me, as I\r\nwent, I perceived almost as though it trailed visibly, the prestige of\r\nFinance and a criminal notoriety. Local personages of a plump and\r\nprosperous quality appeared in the inn making inquiries, the Luzon\r\npriest became helpful, people watched our window, and stared at me as I\r\nwent to and fro; and then we had a raid from a little English clergyman\r\nand his amiable, capable wife in severely Anglican blacks, who swooped\r\ndown upon us like virtuous but resolute vultures from the adjacent\r\nvillage of Saint Jean de Pollack.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman was one of those odd types that oscillate between remote\r\ncountry towns in England and the conduct of English Church services on\r\nmutual terms in enterprising hotels abroad, a tremulous, obstinate\r\nlittle being with sporadic hairs upon his face, spectacles, a red\r\nbutton nose, and aged black raiment. He was evidently enormously\r\nimpressed by my uncle’s monetary greatness, and by his own inkling of\r\nour identity, and he shone and brimmed over with tact and fussy\r\nhelpfulness. He was eager to share the watching of the bedside with me,\r\nhe proffered services with both hands, and as I was now getting into\r\ntouch with affairs in London again, and trying to disentangle the\r\ngigantic details of the smash from the papers I had succeeded in\r\ngetting from Biarritz, I accepted his offers pretty generously, and\r\nbegan the studies in modern finance that lay before me. I had got so\r\nout of touch with the old traditions of religion that I overlooked the\r\nmanifest possibility of his attacking my poor, sinking vestiges of an\r\nuncle with theological solicitudes. My attention was called to that,\r\nhowever, very speedily by a polite but urgent quarrel between himself\r\nand the Basque landlady as to the necessity of her hanging a cheap\r\ncrucifix in the shadow over the bed, where it might catch my uncle’s\r\neye, where, indeed, I found it had caught his eye.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” I cried; “is _that_ still going on!”\r\n\r\nThat night the little clergyman watched, and in the small hours he\r\nraised a false alarm that my uncle was dying, and made an extraordinary\r\nfuss. He raised the house. I shall never forget that scene, I think,\r\nwhich began with a tapping at my bedroom door just after I had fallen\r\nasleep, and his voice—\r\n\r\n“If you want to see your uncle before he goes, you must come now.”\r\n\r\nThe stuffy little room was crowded when I reached it, and lit by three\r\nflickering candles. I felt I was back in the eighteenth century. There\r\nlay my poor uncle amidst indescribably tumbled bedclothes, weary of\r\nlife beyond measure, weary and rambling, and the little clergyman\r\ntrying to hold his hand and his attention, and repeating over and over\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ponderevo, Mr. Ponderevo, it is all right. It is all right.\r\n\r\n“Only Believe! ‘Believe on me, and ye shall be saved’!”\r\n\r\nClose at hand was the doctor with one of those cruel and idiotic\r\ninjection needles modern science puts in the hands of these\r\nhalf-educated young men, keeping my uncle flickeringly alive for no\r\nreason whatever. The _religieuse_ hovered sleepily in the background\r\nwith an overdue and neglected dose. In addition, the landlady had not\r\nonly got up herself, but roused an aged crone of a mother and a\r\npartially imbecile husband, and there was also a fattish, stolid man in\r\ngrey alpaca, with an air of importance—who he was and how he got there,\r\nI don’t know. I rather fancy the doctor explained him to me in French I\r\ndid not understand. And they were all there, wearily nocturnal, hastily\r\nand carelessly dressed, intent upon the life that flickered and sank,\r\nmaking a public and curious show of its going, queer shapes of human\r\nbeings lit by three uncertain candles, and every soul of them keenly\r\nand avidly resolved to be in at the death. The doctor stood, the others\r\nwere all sitting on chairs the landlady had brought in and arranged for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd my uncle spoilt the climax, and did not die.\r\n\r\nI replaced the little clergyman on the chair by the bedside, and he\r\nhovered about the room.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he whispered to me mysteriously, as he gave place to me, “I\r\nbelieve—it is well with him.”\r\n\r\nI heard him trying to render the stock phrases of Low Church piety into\r\nFrench for the benefit of the stolid man in grey alpaca. Then he\r\nknocked a glass off the table, and scrabbled for the fragments. From\r\nthe first I doubted the theory of an immediate death. I consulted the\r\ndoctor in urgent whispers. I turned round to get champagne, and nearly\r\nfell over the clergyman’s legs. He was on his knees at the additional\r\nchair the Basque landlady had got on my arrival, and he was praying\r\naloud, “Oh, Heavenly Father, have mercy on this thy Child....” I\r\nhustled him up and out of the way, and in another minute he was down at\r\nanother chair praying again, and barring the path of the _religieuse_,\r\nwho had found me the corkscrew. Something put into my head that\r\ntremendous blasphemy of Carlyle’s about “the last mew of a drowning\r\nkitten.” He found a third chair vacant presently; it was as if he was\r\nplaying a game.\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!” I said, “we must clear these people out,” and with a\r\ncertain urgency I did.\r\n\r\nI had a temporary lapse of memory, and forgot all my French. I drove\r\nthem out mainly by gesture, and opened the window, to the universal\r\nhorror. I intimated the death scene was postponed, and, as a matter of\r\nfact, my uncle did not die until the next night.\r\n\r\nI did not let the little clergyman come near him again, and I was\r\nwatchful for any sign that his mind had been troubled. But he made\r\nnone. He talked once about “that parson chap.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t bother you?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Wanted something,” he said.\r\n\r\nI kept silence, listening keenly to his mutterings. I understood him to\r\nsay, “They wanted too much.” His face puckered like a child’s going to\r\ncry. “You can’t get a safe six per cent.,” he said. I had for a moment\r\na wild suspicion that those urgent talks had not been altogether\r\nspiritual, but that, I think, was a quite unworthy and unjust\r\nsuspicion. The little clergyman was as simple and honest as the day. My\r\nuncle was simply generalising about his class.\r\n\r\nBut it may have been these talks that set loose some long dormant\r\nstring of ideas in my uncle’s brain, ideas the things of this world had\r\nlong suppressed and hidden altogether. Near the end he suddenly became\r\nclearminded and lucid, albeit very weak, and his voice was little, but\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n“George,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I’m here,” I said, “close beside you.”\r\n\r\n“George. You have always been responsible for the science. George. You\r\nknow better than I do. Is—Is it proved?”\r\n\r\n“What proved?”\r\n\r\n“Either way?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“Death ends all. After so much—Such splendid beginnin’s. Somewhere.\r\nSomething.”\r\n\r\nI stared at him amazed. His sunken eyes were very grave.\r\n\r\n“What do you expect?” I said in wonder.\r\n\r\nHe would not answer. “Aspirations,” he whispered. He fell into a broken\r\nmonologue, regardless of me. “Trailing clouds of glory,” he said, and\r\n“first-rate poet, first-rate....George was always hard. Always.”\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was silence.\r\n\r\nThen he made a gesture that he wished to speak.\r\n\r\n“Seems to me, George”\r\n\r\nI bent my head down, and he tried to lift his hand to my shoulder. I\r\nraised him a little on his pillows, and listened.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me, George, always—there must be something in me—that\r\nwon’t die.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me as though the decision rested with me.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he said; “—something.”\r\n\r\nThen, for a moment, his mind wandered. “Just a little link,” he\r\nwhispered almost pleadingly, and lay quite still, but presently he was\r\nuneasy again.\r\n\r\n“Some other world”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” I said. “Who knows?”\r\n\r\n“Some other world.”\r\n\r\n“Not the same scope for enterprise,” I said.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nHe became silent. I sat leaning down to him, and following out my own\r\nthoughts, and presently the _religieuse_ resumed her periodic conflict\r\nwith the window fastening. For a time he struggled for breath.... It\r\nseemed such nonsense that he should have to suffer so—poor silly little\r\nman!\r\n\r\n“George,” he whispered, and his weak little hand came out. “_Perhaps_—”\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but I perceived from the expression of his eyes that\r\nhe thought the question had been put.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think so;” I said stoutly.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you sure?”\r\n\r\n“Oh—practically sure,” said I, and I think he tried to squeeze my hand.\r\nAnd there I sat, holding his hand tight, and trying to think what seeds\r\nof immortality could be found in all his being, what sort of ghost\r\nthere was in _him_ to wander out into the bleak immensities. Queer\r\nfancies came to me.... He lay still for a long time, save for a brief\r\nstruggle or so for breath and ever and again I wiped his mouth and\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nI fell into a pit of thought. I did not remark at first the change that\r\nwas creeping over his face. He lay back on his pillow, made a faint\r\nzzzing sound that ceased, and presently and quite quietly he\r\ndied—greatly comforted by my assurance. I do not know when he died. His\r\nhand relaxed insensibly. Suddenly, with a start, with a shock, I found\r\nthat his mouth had fallen open, and that he was dead....\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIt was dark night when I left his deathbed and went back to my own inn\r\ndown the straggling street of Luzon.\r\n\r\nThat return to my inn sticks in my memory also as a thing apart, as an\r\nexperience apart. Within was a subdued bustle of women, a flitting of\r\nlights, and the doing of petty offices to that queer, exhausted thing\r\nthat had once been my active and urgent little uncle. For me those\r\noffices were irksome and impertinent. I slammed the door, and went out\r\ninto the warm, foggy drizzle of the village street lit by blurred\r\nspecks of light in great voids of darkness, and never a soul abroad.\r\nThat warm veil of fog produced an effect of vast seclusion. The very\r\nhouses by the roadside peered through it as if from another world. The\r\nstillness of the night was marked by an occasional remote baying of\r\ndogs; all these people kept dogs because of the near neighbourhood of\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\nDeath!\r\n\r\nIt was one of those rare seasons of relief, when for a little time one\r\nwalks a little outside of and beside life. I felt as I sometimes feel\r\nafter the end of a play. I saw the whole business of my uncle’s life as\r\nsomething familiar and completed. It was done, like a play one leaves,\r\nlike a book one closes. I thought of the push and the promotions, the\r\nnoise of London, the crowded, various company of people through which\r\nour lives had gone, the public meetings, the excitements, the dinners\r\nand disputations, and suddenly it appeared to me that none of these\r\nthings existed.\r\n\r\nIt came to me like a discovery that none of these things existed.\r\n\r\nBefore and after I have thought and called life a phantasmagoria, but\r\nnever have I felt its truth as I did that night.... We had parted; we\r\ntwo who had kept company so long had parted. But there was, I knew, no\r\nend to him or me. He had died a dream death, and ended a dream; his\r\npain dream was over. It seemed to me almost as though I had died, too.\r\nWhat did it matter, since it was unreality, all of it, the pain and\r\ndesire, the beginning and the end? There was no reality except this\r\nsolitary road, this quite solitary road, along which one went rather\r\npuzzled, rather tired....\r\n\r\nPart of the fog became a big mastiff that came towards me and stopped\r\nand slunk round me, growling, barked gruffly, and shortly and presently\r\nbecame fog again.\r\n\r\nMy mind swayed back to the ancient beliefs and fears of our race. My\r\ndoubts and disbeliefs slipped from me like a loosely fitting garment. I\r\nwondered quite simply what dogs bayed about the path of that other\r\nwalker in the darkness, what shapes, what lights, it might be, loomed\r\nabout him as he went his way from our last encounter on earth—along the\r\npaths that are real, and the way that endures for ever?\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nLast belated figure in that grouping round my uncle’s deathbed is my\r\naunt. When it was beyond all hope that my uncle could live I threw\r\naside whatever concealment remained to us and telegraphed directly to\r\nher. But she came too late to see him living. She saw him calm and\r\nstill, strangely unlike his habitual garrulous animation, an unfamiliar\r\ninflexibility.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t like him,” she whispered, awed by this alien dignity.\r\n\r\nI remember her chiefly as she talked and wept upon the bridge below the\r\nold castle. We had got rid of some amateurish reporters from Biarritz,\r\nand had walked together in the hot morning sunshine down through Port\r\nLuzon. There, for a time, we stood leaning on the parapet of the bridge\r\nand surveying the distant peeks, the rich blue masses of the Pyrenees.\r\nFor a long time we said nothing, and then she began talking.\r\n\r\n“Life’s a rum Go, George!” she began. “Who would have thought, when I\r\nused to darn your stockings at old Wimblehurst, that this would be the\r\nend of the story? It seems far away now—that little shop, his and my\r\nfirst home. The glow of the bottles, the big coloured bottles! Do you\r\nremember how the light shone on the mahogany drawers? The little gilt\r\nletters! _Ol Amjig_, and _S’nap!_ I can remember it all—bright and\r\nshining—like a Dutch picture. Real! And yesterday. And here we are in a\r\ndream. You a man—and me an old woman, George. And poor little Teddy,\r\nwho used to rush about and talk—making that noise he did—Oh!”\r\n\r\nShe choked, and the tears flowed unrestrained. She wept, and I was glad\r\nto see her weeping.\r\n\r\nShe stood leaning over the bridge; her tear-wet handkerchief gripped in\r\nher clenched hand.\r\n\r\n“Just an hour in the old shop again—and him talking. Before things got\r\ndone. Before they got hold of him. And fooled him.\r\n\r\n“Men oughtn’t to be so tempted with business and things....\r\n\r\n“They didn’t hurt him, George?” she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Here, I mean,” she said.\r\n\r\n“No,” I lied stoutly, suppressing the memory of that foolish injection\r\nneedle I had caught the young doctor using.\r\n\r\n“I wonder, George, if they’ll let him talk in Heaven....”\r\n\r\nShe faced me. “Oh! George, dear, my heart aches, and I don’t know what\r\nI say and do. Give me your arm to lean on—it’s good to have you, dear,\r\nand lean upon you.... Yes, I know you care for me. That’s why I’m\r\ntalking. We’ve always loved one another, and never said anything about\r\nit, and you understand, and I understand. But my heart’s torn to pieces\r\nby this, torn to rags, and things drop out I’ve kept in it. It’s true\r\nhe wasn’t a husband much for me at the last. But he was my child,\r\nGeorge, he was my child and all my children, my silly child, and life\r\nhas knocked him about for me, and I’ve never had a say in the matter;\r\nnever a say; it’s puffed him up and smashed him—like an old bag—under\r\nmy eyes. I was clever enough to see it, and not clever enough to\r\nprevent it, and all I could do was to jeer. I’ve had to make what I\r\ncould of it. Like most people. Like most of us.... But it wasn’t fair,\r\nGeorge. It wasn’t fair. Life and Death—great serious things—why\r\ncouldn’t they leave him alone, and his lies and ways? If _we_ could see\r\nthe lightness of it—\r\n\r\n“Why couldn’t they leave him alone?” she repeated in a whisper as we\r\nwent towards the inn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\r\nLOVE AMONG THE WRECKAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen I came back I found that my share in the escape and death of my\r\nuncle had made me for a time a notorious and even popular character.\r\nFor two weeks I was kept in London “facing the music,” as he would have\r\nsaid, and making things easy for my aunt, and I still marvel at the\r\nconsideration with which the world treated me. For now it was open and\r\nmanifest that I and my uncle were no more than specimens of a modern\r\nspecies of brigand, wasting the savings of the public out of the sheer\r\nwantonness of enterprise. I think that in a way, his death produced a\r\nreaction in my favour and my flight, of which some particulars now\r\nappeared stuck in the popular imagination. It seemed a more daring and\r\ndifficult feat than it was, and I couldn’t very well write to the\r\npapers to sustain my private estimate. There can be little doubt that\r\nmen infinitely prefer the appearance of dash and enterprise to simple\r\nhonesty. No one believed I was not an arch plotter in his financing.\r\nYet they favoured me. I even got permission from the trustee to occupy\r\nmy chalet for a fortnight while I cleared up the mass of papers,\r\ncalculations, notes of work, drawings and the like, that I left in\r\ndisorder when I started on that impulsive raid upon the Mordet quap\r\nheaps.\r\n\r\nI was there alone. I got work for Cothope with the Ilchesters, for whom\r\nI now build these destroyers. They wanted him at once, and he was short\r\nof money, so I let him go and managed very philosophically by myself.\r\n\r\nBut I found it hard to fix my attention on aeronautics, I had been away\r\nfrom the work for a full half-year and more, a half-year crowded with\r\nintense disconcerting things. For a time my brain refused these fine\r\nproblems of balance and adjustment altogether; it wanted to think about\r\nmy uncle’s dropping jaw, my aunt’s reluctant tears, about dead negroes\r\nand pestilential swamps, about the evident realities of cruelty and\r\npain, about life and death. Moreover, it was weary with the frightful\r\npile of figures and documents at the Hardingham, a task to which this\r\nraid to Lady Grove was simply an interlude. And there was Beatrice.\r\n\r\nOn the second morning, as I sat out upon the veranda recalling memories\r\nand striving in vain to attend to some too succinct pencil notes of\r\nCothope’s, Beatrice rode up suddenly from behind the pavilion, and\r\npulled rein and became still; Beatrice, a little flushed from riding\r\nand sitting on a big black horse.\r\n\r\nI did not instantly rise. I stared at her. “_You!_” I said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me steadily. “Me,” she said\r\n\r\nI did not trouble about any civilities. I stood up and asked point\r\nblank a question that came into my head.\r\n\r\n“Whose horse is that?” I said.\r\n\r\nShe looked me in the eyes. “Carnaby’s,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“How did you get here—this way?”\r\n\r\n“The wall’s down.”\r\n\r\n“Down? Already?”\r\n\r\n“A great bit of it between the plantations.”\r\n\r\n“And you rode through, and got here by chance?”\r\n\r\n“I saw you yesterday. And I rode over to see you.” I had now come close\r\nto her, and stood looking up into her face.\r\n\r\n“I’m a mere vestige,” I said.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, but remained regarding me steadfastly with a\r\ncurious air of proprietorship.\r\n\r\n“You know I’m the living survivor now of the great smash. I’m rolling\r\nand dropping down through all the scaffolding of the social system....\r\nIt’s all a chance whether I roll out free at the bottom, or go down a\r\ncrack into the darkness out of sight for a year or two.”\r\n\r\n“The sun,” she remarked irrelevantly, “has burnt you.... I’m getting\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nShe swung herself down into my arms, and stood beside me face to face.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Cothope?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Gone.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes flitted to the pavilion and back to me. We stood close\r\ntogether, extraordinarily intimate, and extraordinarily apart.\r\n\r\n“I’ve never seen this cottage of yours,” she said, “and I want to.”\r\n\r\nShe flung the bridle of her horse round the veranda post, and I helped\r\nher tie it.\r\n\r\n“Did you get what you went for to Africa?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “I lost my ship.”\r\n\r\n“And that lost everything?”\r\n\r\n“Everything.”\r\n\r\nShe walked before me into the living-room of the chalet, and I saw that\r\nshe gripped her riding-whip very tightly in her hand. She looked about\r\nher for a moment,—and then at me.\r\n\r\n“It’s comfortable,” she remarked.\r\n\r\nOur eyes met in a conversation very different from the one upon our\r\nlips. A sombre glow surrounded us, drew us together; an unwonted\r\nshyness kept us apart. She roused herself, after an instant’s pause, to\r\nexamine my furniture.\r\n\r\n“You have chintz curtains. I thought men were too feckless to have\r\ncurtains without a woman. But, of course, your aunt did that! And a\r\ncouch and a brass fender, and—is that a pianola? That is your desk. I\r\nthought men’s desks were always untidy, and covered with dust and\r\ntobacco ash.”\r\n\r\nShe flitted to my colour prints and my little case of books. Then she\r\nwent to the pianola. I watched her intently.\r\n\r\n“Does this thing play?” she said.\r\n\r\n“What?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Does this thing play?”\r\n\r\nI roused myself from my preoccupation.\r\n\r\n“Like a musical gorilla with fingers all of one length. And a sort of\r\nsoul.... It’s all the world of music to me.”\r\n\r\n“What do you play?”\r\n\r\n“Beethoven, when I want to clear up my head while I’m working. He\r\nis—how one would always like to work. Sometimes Chopin and those\r\nothers, but Beethoven. Beethoven mainly. Yes.”\r\n\r\nSilence again between us. She spoke with an effort.\r\n\r\n“Play me something.” She turned from me and explored the rack of music\r\nrolls, became interested and took a piece, the first part of the\r\nKreutzer Sonata, hesitated. “No,” she said, “that!”\r\n\r\nShe gave me Brahms’ Second Concerto, Op. 58, and curled up on the sofa\r\nwatching me as I set myself slowly to play....\r\n\r\n“I say,” he said when I had done, “that’s fine. I didn’t know those\r\nthings could play like that. I’m all astir...”\r\n\r\nShe came and stood over me, looking at me. “I’m going to have a\r\nconcert,” she said abruptly, and laughed uneasily and hovered at the\r\npigeon-holes. “Now—now what shall I have?” She chose more of Brahms.\r\nThen we came to the Kreutzer Sonata. It is queer how Tolstoy has loaded\r\nthat with suggestions, debauched it, made it a scandalous and intimate\r\nsymbol. When I had played the first part of that, she came up to the\r\npianola and hesitated over me. I sat stiffly—waiting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she seized my downcast head and kissed my hair. She caught at\r\nmy face between her hands and kissed my lips. I put my arms about her\r\nand we kissed together. I sprang to my feet and clasped her.\r\n\r\n“Beatrice!” I said. “Beatrice!”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” she whispered, nearly breathless, with her arms about me.\r\n“Oh! my dear!”\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLove, like everything else in this immense process of social\r\ndisorganisation in which we live, is a thing adrift, a fruitless thing\r\nbroken away from its connexions. I tell of this love affair here\r\nbecause of its irrelevance, because it is so remarkable that it should\r\nmean nothing, and be nothing except itself. It glows in my memory like\r\nsome bright casual flower starting up amidst the _débris_ of a\r\ncatastrophe. For nearly a fortnight we two met and made love together.\r\nOnce more this mighty passion, that our aimless civilisation has\r\nfettered and maimed and sterilised and debased, gripped me and filled\r\nme with passionate delights and solemn joys—that were all, you know,\r\nfutile and purposeless. Once more I had the persuasion “This matters.\r\nNothing else matters so much as this.” We were both infinitely grave in\r\nsuch happiness as we had. I do not remember any laughter at all between\r\nus.\r\n\r\nTwelve days it lasted from that encounter in my chalet until our\r\nparting.\r\n\r\nExcept at the end, they were days of supreme summer, and there was a\r\nwaxing moon. We met recklessly day by day. We were so intent upon each\r\nother at first so intent upon expressing ourselves to each other, and\r\ngetting at each other, that we troubled very little about the\r\nappearance of our relationship. We met almost openly.... We talked of\r\nten thousand things, and of ourselves. We loved. We made love. There is\r\nno prose of mine that can tell of hours transfigured. The facts are\r\nnothing. Everything we touched, the meanest things, became glorious.\r\nHow can I render bare tenderness and delight and mutual possession? I\r\nsit here at my desk thinking of untellable things.\r\n\r\nI have come to know so much of love that I know now what love might be.\r\nWe loved, scarred and stained; we parted—basely and inevitably, but at\r\nleast I met love.\r\n\r\nI remember as we sat in a Canadian canoe, in a reedy, bush-masked\r\nshallow we had discovered operating out of that pine-shaded Woking\r\ncanal, how she fell talking of the things that happened to her before\r\nshe met me again....\r\n\r\nShe told me things, and they so joined and welded together other things\r\nthat lay disconnected in my memory, that it seemed to me I had always\r\nknown what she told me. And yet indeed I had not known nor suspected\r\nit, save perhaps for a luminous, transitory suspicion ever and again.\r\n\r\nShe made me see how life had shaped her. She told me of her girlhood\r\nafter I had known her. “We were poor and pretending and managing. We\r\nhacked about on visits and things. I ought to have married. The chances\r\nI had weren’t particularly good chances. I didn’t like ’em.”\r\n\r\nShe paused. “Then Carnaby came along.”\r\n\r\nI remained quite still. She spoke now with downcast eyes, and one\r\nfinger just touching the water.\r\n\r\n“One gets bored, bored beyond redemption. One does about to these huge\r\nexpensive houses I suppose—the scale’s immense. One makes one’s self\r\nuseful to the other women, and agreeable to the men. One has to\r\ndress.... One has food and exercise and leisure, It’s the leisure, and\r\nthe space, and the blank opportunity it seems a sin not to fill.\r\nCarnaby isn’t like the other men. He’s bigger.... They go about making\r\nlove. Everybody’s making love. I did.... And I don’t do things by\r\nhalves.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n“You knew?”—she asked, looking up, quite steadily. I nodded.\r\n\r\n“Since when?”\r\n\r\n“Those last days.... It hasn’t seemed to matter really. I was a little\r\nsurprised.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me quietly. “Cothope knew,” she said. “By instinct. I\r\ncould feel it.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” I began, “once, this would have mattered immensely. Now—”\r\n\r\n“Nothing matters,” she said, completing me. “I felt I had to tell you.\r\nI wanted you to understand why I didn’t marry you—with both hands. I\r\nhave loved you”—she paused—“have loved you ever since the day I kissed\r\nyou in the bracken. Only—I forgot.”\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly she dropped her face upon her hands, and sobbed\r\npassionately—\r\n\r\n“I forgot—I forgot,” she cried, and became still....\r\n\r\nI dabbled my paddle in the water. “Look here!” I said; “forget again!\r\nHere am I—a ruined man. Marry me.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head without looking up.\r\n\r\nWe were still for a long time. “Marry me!” I whispered.\r\n\r\nShe looked up, twined back a whisp of hair, and answered\r\ndispassionately—\r\n\r\n“I wish I could. Anyhow, we have had this time. It has been a fine\r\ntime—has it been—for you also? I haven’t nudged you all I had to give.\r\nIt’s a poor gift—except for what it means and might have been. But we\r\nare near the end of it now.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” I asked. “Marry me! Why should we two—”\r\n\r\n“You think,” she said, “I could take courage and come to you and be\r\nyour everyday wife—while you work and are poor?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said I.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me gravely, with extended finger. “Do you really think\r\nthat—of me? Haven’t you seen me—all?”\r\n\r\nI hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Never once have I really meant marrying you,” she insisted. “Never\r\nonce. I fell in love with you from the first. But when you seemed a\r\nsuccessful man, I told myself I wouldn’t. I was love-sick for you, and\r\nyou were so stupid, I came near it then. But I knew I wasn’t good\r\nenough. What could I have been to you? A woman with bad habits and bad\r\nassociations, a woman smirched. And what could I do for you or be to\r\nyou? If I wasn’t good enough to be a rich man’s wife, I’m certainly not\r\ngood enough to be a poor one’s. Forgive me for talking sense to you\r\nnow, but I wanted to tell you this somehow.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped at my gesture. I sat up, and the canoe rocked with my\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” I said. “I want to marry you and make you my wife!”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “don’t spoil things. That is impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Think! I can’t do my own hair! Do you mean you will get me a maid?”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” I cried, disconcerted beyond measure, “won’t you learn to\r\ndo your own hair for me? Do you mean to say you can love a man—”\r\n\r\nShe flung out her hands at me. “Don’t spoil it,” she cried. “I have\r\ngiven you all I have, I have given you all I can. If I could do it, if\r\nI was good enough to do it, I would. But I am a woman spoilt and\r\nruined, dear, and you are a ruined man. When we are making love we’re\r\nlovers—but think of the gulf between us in habits and ways of thought,\r\nin will and training, when we are not making love. Think of it—and\r\ndon’t think of it! Don’t think of it yet. We have snatched some hours.\r\nWe still may have some hours!”\r\n\r\nShe suddenly knelt forward toward me, with a glowing darkness in her\r\neyes. “Who cares if it upsets?” she cried. “If you say another word I\r\nwill kiss you. And go to the bottom clutching you.\r\n\r\n“I’m not afraid of that. I’m not a bit afraid of that. I’ll die with\r\nyou. Choose a death, and I’ll die with you—readily. Do listen to me! I\r\nlove you. I shall always love you. It’s because I love you that I won’t\r\ngo down to become a dirty familiar thing with you amidst the grime.\r\nI’ve given all I can. I’ve had all I can.... Tell me,” and she crept\r\nnearer, “have I been like the dusk to you, like the warm dusk? Is there\r\nmagic still? Listen to the ripple of water from your paddle. Look at\r\nthe warm evening light in the sky. Who cares if the canoe upsets? Come\r\nnearer to me. Oh, my love! come near! So.”\r\n\r\nShe drew me to her and our lips met.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nI asked her to marry me once again.\r\n\r\nIt was our last morning together, and we had met very early, about\r\nsunrise, knowing that we were to part. No sun shone that day. The sky\r\nwas overcast, the morning chilly and lit by a clear, cold, spiritless\r\nlight. A heavy dampness in the air verged close on rain. When I think\r\nof that morning, it has always the quality of greying ashes wet with\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nBeatrice too had changed. The spring had gone out of her movement; it\r\ncame to me, for the first time, that some day she might grow old. She\r\nhad become one flesh with the rest of common humanity; the softness had\r\ngone from her voice and manner, the dusky magic of her presence had\r\ngone. I saw these things with perfect clearness, and they made me sorry\r\nfor them and for her. But they altered my love not a whit, abated it\r\nnothing. And when we had talked awkwardly for half a dozen sentences, I\r\ncame dully to my point.\r\n\r\n“And now,” I cried, “will you marry me?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “I shall keep to my life here.”\r\n\r\nI asked her to marry me in a year’s time. She shook her head.\r\n\r\n“This world is a soft world,” I said, “in spite of my present\r\ndisasters. I know now how to do things. If I had you to work for—in a\r\nyear I could be a prosperous man.”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “I will put it brutally, I shall go back to Carnaby.”\r\n\r\n“But—!” I did not feel angry. I had no sort of jealousy, no wounded\r\npride, no sense of injury. I had only a sense of grey desolation, of\r\nhopeless cross-purposes.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” she said. “I have been awake all night and every night. I\r\nhave been thinking of this—every moment when we have not been together.\r\nI’m not answering you on an impulse. I love you. I love you. I’ll say\r\nthat over ten thousand times. But here we are—”\r\n\r\n“The rest of life together,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be together. Now we are together. Now we have been\r\ntogether. We are full of memories I do not feel I can ever forget a\r\nsingle one.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\n“And I want to close it and leave it at that. You see, dear, what else\r\nis there to do?”\r\n\r\nShe turned her white face to me. “All I know of love, all I have ever\r\ndreamt or learnt of love I have packed into these days for you. You\r\nthink we might live together and go on loving. No! For you I will have\r\nno vain repetitions. You have had the best and all of me. Would you\r\nhave us, after this, meet again in London or Paris or somewhere,\r\nscuffle to some wretched dressmaker’s, meet in a _cabinet\r\nparticulier?_”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said. “I want you to marry me. I want you to play the game of\r\nlife with me as an honest woman should. Come and live with me. Be my\r\nwife and squaw. Bear me children.”\r\n\r\nI looked at her white, drawn face, and it seemed to me I might carry\r\nher yet. I spluttered for words.\r\n\r\n“My God! Beatrice!” I cried; “but this is cowardice and folly! Are\r\n_you_ afraid of life? You of all people! What does it matter what has\r\nbeen or what we were? Here we are with the world before us! Start clean\r\nand new with me. We’ll fight it through! I’m not such a simple lover\r\nthat I’ll not tell you plainly when you go wrong, and fight our\r\ndifference out with you. It’s the one thing I want, the one thing I\r\nneed—to have you, and more of you and more! This love-making—it’s\r\nlove-making. It’s just a part of us, an incident—”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and stopped me abruptly. “It’s all,” she said.\r\n\r\n“All!” I protested.\r\n\r\n“I’m wiser than you. Wiser beyond words.” She turned her eyes to me and\r\nthey shone with tears.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t have you say anything—but what you’re saying,” she said.\r\n“But it’s nonsense, dear. You know it’s nonsense as you say it.”\r\n\r\nI tried to keep up the heroic note, but she would not listen to it.\r\n\r\n“It’s no good,” she cried almost petulantly. “This little world has\r\nmade us what we are. Don’t you see—don’t you see what I am? I can make\r\nlove. I can make love and be loved, prettily. Dear, don’t blame me. I\r\nhave given you all I have. If I had anything more—I have gone through\r\nit all over and over again—thought it out. This morning my head aches,\r\nmy eyes ache.\r\n\r\n“The light has gone out of me and I am a sick and tired woman. But I’m\r\ntalking wisdom—bitter wisdom. I couldn’t be any sort of helper to you,\r\nany sort of wife, any sort of mother. I’m spoilt.\r\n\r\n“I’m spoilt by this rich idle way of living, until every habit is\r\nwrong, every taste wrong. The world is wrong. People can be ruined by\r\nwealth just as much as by poverty. Do you think I wouldn’t face life\r\nwith you if I could, if I wasn’t absolutely certain I should be down\r\nand dragging in the first half-mile of the journey? Here I am—damned!\r\nDamned! But I won’t damn you. You know what I am! You know. You are too\r\nclear and simple not to know the truth. You try to romance and hector,\r\nbut you know the truth. I am a little cad—sold and done. I’m—. My dear,\r\nyou think I’ve been misbehaving, but all these days I’ve been on my\r\nbest behaviour.... You don’t understand, because you’re a man.\r\n\r\n“A woman, when she’s spoilt, is _spoilt_. She’s dirty in grain. She’s\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nShe walked on weeping.\r\n\r\n“You’re a fool to want me,” she said. “You’re a fool to want me—for my\r\nsake just as much as yours. We’ve done all we can. It’s just\r\nromancing—”\r\n\r\nShe dashed the tears from her eyes and turned upon me. “Don’t you\r\nunderstand?” she challenged. “Don’t you know?”\r\n\r\nWe faced one another in silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “I know.”\r\n\r\nFor a long time we spoke never a word, but walked on together, slowly\r\nand sorrowfully, reluctant to turn about towards our parting. When at\r\nlast we did, she broke silence again.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Heaven and hell,” I said, “can’t alter that.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve wanted—” she went on. “I’ve talked to you in the nights and made\r\nup speeches. Now when I want to make them I’m tongue-tied. But to me\r\nit’s just as if the moments we have had lasted for ever. Moods and\r\nstates come and go. To-day my light is out...”\r\n\r\nTo this day I cannot determine whether she said or whether I imagined\r\nshe said “chloral.” Perhaps a half-conscious diagnosis flashed it on my\r\nbrain. Perhaps I am the victim of some perverse imaginative freak of\r\nmemory, some hinted possibility that scratched and seared. There the\r\nword stands in my memory, as if it were written in fire.\r\n\r\nWe came to the door of Lady Osprey’s garden at last, and it was\r\nbeginning to drizzle.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hands and I took them.\r\n\r\n“Yours,” she said, in a weary unimpassioned voice; “all that I had—such\r\nas it was. Will you forget?”\r\n\r\n“Never,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Never a touch or a word of it?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You will,” she said.\r\n\r\nWe looked at one another in silence, and her face full of fatigue and\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do? What was there to do?\r\n\r\n“I wish—” I said, and stopped.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThat should have been the last I saw of her, but, indeed, I was\r\ndestined to see her once again. Two days after I was at Lady Grove, I\r\nforget altogether upon what errand, and as I walked back to the station\r\nbelieving her to be gone away she came upon me, and she was riding with\r\nCarnaby, just as I had seen them first. The encounter jumped upon us\r\nunprepared. She rode by, her eyes dark in her white face, and scarcely\r\nnoticed me. She winced and grew stiff at the sight of me and bowed her\r\nhead. But Carnaby, because he thought I was a broken and discomfited\r\nman, saluted me with an easy friendliness, and shouted some genial\r\ncommonplace to me.\r\n\r\nThey passed out of sight and left me by the roadside....\r\n\r\nAnd then, indeed, I tasted the ultimate bitterness of life. For the\r\nfirst time I felt utter futility, and was wrung by emotion that begot\r\nno action, by shame and pity beyond words. I had parted from her dully\r\nand I had seen my uncle break and die with dry eyes and a steady mind,\r\nbut this chance sight of my lost Beatrice brought me to tears. My face\r\nwas wrung, and tears came pouring down my cheeks. All the magic she had\r\nfor me had changed to wild sorrow. “Oh God!” I cried, “this is too\r\nmuch,” and turned my face after her and made appealing gestures to the\r\nbeech trees and cursed at fate. I wanted to do preposterous things, to\r\npursue her, to save her, to turn life back so that she might begin\r\nagain. I wonder what would have happened had I overtaken them in\r\npursuit, breathless with running, uttering incoherent words, weeping,\r\nexpostulatory. I came near to doing that.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in earth or heaven to respect my curses or weeping.\r\nIn the midst of it a man who had been trimming the opposite hedge\r\nappeared and stared at me.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, ridiculously, I dissembled before him and went on and caught\r\nmy train....\r\n\r\nBut the pain I felt then I have felt a hundred times; it is with me as\r\nI write. It haunts this book, I see, that is what haunts this book,\r\nfrom end to end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\r\nNIGHT AND THE OPEN SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI have tried throughout all this story to tell things as they happened\r\nto me. In the beginning—the sheets are still here on the table, grimy\r\nand dogs-eared and old-looking—I said I wanted to tell _myself_ and the\r\nworld in which I found myself, and I have done my best. But whether I\r\nhave succeeded I cannot imagine. All this writing is grey now and dead\r\nand trite and unmeaning to me; some of it I know by heart. I am the\r\nlast person to judge it.\r\n\r\nAs I turn over the big pile of manuscript before me certain things\r\nbecome clearer to me, and particularly the immense inconsequences of my\r\nexperiences. It is, I see now that I have it all before me, a story of\r\nactivity and urgency and sterility. I have called it _Tono-Bungay_, but\r\nI had far better have called it _Waste_. I have told of childless\r\nMarion, of my childless aunt, of Beatrice wasted and wasteful and\r\nfutile. What hope is there for a people whose women become fruitless? I\r\nthink of all the energy I have given to vain things. I think of my\r\nindustrious scheming with my uncle, of Crest Hill’s vast cessation, of\r\nhis resonant strenuous career. Ten thousand men have envied him and\r\nwished to live as he lived. It is all one spectacle of forces running\r\nto waste, of people who use and do not replace, the story of a country\r\nhectic with a wasting aimless fever of trade and money-making and\r\npleasure-seeking. And now I build destroyers!\r\n\r\nOther people may see this country in other terms; this is how I have\r\nseen it. In some early chapter in this heap I compared all our present\r\ncolour and abundance to October foliage before the frosts nip down the\r\nleaves. That I still feel was a good image. Perhaps I see wrongly. It\r\nmay be I see decay all about me because I am, in a sense, decay. To\r\nothers it may be a scene of achievement and construction radiant with\r\nhope. I, too, have a sort of hope, but it is a remote hope, a hope that\r\nfinds no promise in this Empire or in any of the great things of our\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHow they will look in history I do not know, how time and chance will\r\nprove them I cannot guess; that is how they have mirrored themselves on\r\none contemporary mind.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nConcurrently with writing the last chapter of this book I have been\r\nmuch engaged by the affairs of a new destroyer we have completed. It\r\nhas been an oddly complementary alternation of occupations. Three weeks\r\nor so ago this novel had to be put aside in order that I might give all\r\nmy time day and night to the fitting and finishing of the engines. Last\r\nThursday X 2, for so we call her, was done and I took her down the\r\nThames and went out nearly to Texel for a trial of speed.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how at times one’s impressions will all fuse and run\r\ntogether into a sort of unity and become continuous with things that\r\nhave hitherto been utterly alien and remote. That rush down the river\r\nbecame mysteriously connected with this book.\r\n\r\nAs I passed down the Thames I seemed in a new and parallel manner to be\r\npassing all England in review. I saw it then as I had wanted my readers\r\nto see it. The thought came to me slowly as I picked my way through the\r\nPool; it stood out clear as I went dreaming into the night out upon the\r\nwide North Sea.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t so much thinking at the time as a sort of photographic\r\nthought that came and grew clear. X2 went ripping through the dirty\r\noily water as scissors rip through canvas, and the front of my mind was\r\nall intent with getting her through under the bridges and in and out\r\namong the steam-boats and barges and rowing-boats and piers. I lived\r\nwith my hands and eyes hard ahead. I thought nothing then of any\r\nappearances but obstacles, but for all that the back of my mind took\r\nthe photographic memory of it complete and vivid....\r\n\r\n“This,” it came to me, “is England. That is what I wanted to give in my\r\nbook. This!”\r\n\r\nWe started in the late afternoon. We throbbed out of our yard above\r\nHammersmith Bridge, fussed about for a moment, and headed down stream.\r\nWe came at an easy rush down Craven Reach, past Fulham and Hurlingham,\r\npast the long stretches of muddy meadow And muddy suburb to Battersea\r\nand Chelsea, round the cape of tidy frontage that is Grosvenor Road and\r\nunder Vauxhall Bridge, and Westminster opened before us. We cleared a\r\nstring of coal barges and there on the left in the October sunshine\r\nstood the Parliament houses, and the flag was flying and Parliament was\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nI saw it at the time unseeingly; afterwards it came into my mind as the\r\ncentre of the whole broad panoramic effect of that afternoon. The stiff\r\nsquare lace of Victorian Gothic with its Dutch clock of a tower came\r\nupon me suddenly and stared and whirled past in a slow half pirouette\r\nand became still, I know, behind me as if watching me recede. “Aren’t\r\nyou going to respect me, then?” it seemed to say.\r\n\r\nNot I! There in that great pile of Victorian architecture the landlords\r\nand the lawyers, the bishops, the railway men and the magnates of\r\ncommerce go to and fro—in their incurable tradition of commercialised\r\nBladesovery, of meretricious gentry and nobility sold for riches. I\r\nhave been near enough to know. The Irish and the Labour-men run about\r\namong their feet, making a fuss, effecting little, they’ve got no\r\nbetter plans that I can see. Respect it indeed! There’s a certain\r\nparaphernalia of dignity, but whom does it deceive? The King comes down\r\nin a gilt coach to open the show and wears long robes and a crown; and\r\nthere’s a display of stout and slender legs in white stockings and\r\nstout and slender legs in black stockings and artful old gentlemen in\r\nermine. I was reminded of one congested afternoon I had spent with my\r\naunt amidst a cluster of agitated women’s hats in the Royal Gallery of\r\nthe House of Lords and how I saw the King going to open Parliament, and\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire looking like a gorgeous pedlar and terribly\r\nbored with the cap of maintenance on a tray before him hung by slings\r\nfrom his shoulder. A wonderful spectacle!\r\n\r\nIt is quaint, no doubt, this England—it is even dignified in places—and\r\nfull of mellow associations. That does not alter the quality of the\r\nrealities these robes conceal. The realities are greedy trade, base\r\nprofit—seeking, bold advertisement; and kingship and chivalry, spite of\r\nthis wearing of treasured robes, are as dead among it all as that\r\ncrusader my uncle championed against the nettles outside the Duffield\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nI have thought much of that bright afternoon’s panorama.\r\n\r\nTo run down the Thames so is to run one’s hand over the pages in the\r\nbook of England from end to end. One begins in Craven Reach and it is\r\nas if one were in the heart of old England. Behind us are Kew and\r\nHampton Court with their memories of Kings and Cardinals, and one runs\r\nat first between Fulham’s episcopal garden parties and Hurlingham’s\r\nplayground for the sporting instinct of our race. The whole effect is\r\nEnglish. There is space, there are old trees and all the best qualities\r\nof the home-land in that upper reach. Putney, too, looks Anglican on a\r\ndwindling scale. And then for a stretch the newer developments slop\r\nover, one misses Bladesover and there come first squalid stretches of\r\nmean homes right and left and then the dingy industrialism of the south\r\nside, and on the north bank the polite long front of nice houses,\r\nartistic, literary, administrative people’s residences, that stretches\r\nfrom Cheyne Walk nearly to Westminster and hides a wilderness of slums.\r\nWhat a long slow crescendo that is, mile after mile, with the houses\r\ncrowding closelier, the multiplying succession of church towers, the\r\narchitectural moments, the successive bridges, until you come out into\r\nthe second movement of the piece with Lambeth’s old palace under your\r\nquarter and the houses of Parliament on your bow! Westminster Bridge is\r\nahead of you then, and through it you flash, and in a moment the\r\nround-faced clock tower cranes up to peer at you again and New Scotland\r\nYard squares at you, a fat beef-eater of a policeman disguised\r\nmiraculously as a Bastille.\r\n\r\nFor a stretch you have the essential London; you have Charing Cross\r\nrailway station, heart of the world, and the Embankment on the north\r\nside with its new hotels overshadowing its Georgian and Victorian\r\narchitecture, and mud and great warehouses and factories, chimneys,\r\nshot towers, advertisements on the south. The northward skyline grows\r\nmore intricate and pleasing, and more and more does one thank God for\r\nWren. Somerset House is as picturesque as the civil war, one is\r\nreminded again of the original England, one feels in the fretted sky\r\nthe quality of Restoration Lace.\r\n\r\nAnd then comes Astor’s strong box and the lawyers’ Inns.\r\n\r\n(I had a passing memory of myself there, how once I had trudged along\r\nthe Embankment westward, weighing my uncle’s offer of three hundred\r\npounds a year....)\r\n\r\nThrough that central essential London reach I drove, and X2 bored her\r\nnose under the foam regardless of it all like a black hound going\r\nthrough reeds—on what trail even I who made her cannot tell.\r\n\r\nAnd in this reach, too, one first meets the seagulls and is reminded of\r\nthe sea. Blackfriars one takes—just under these two bridges and just\r\nbetween them is the finest bridge moment in the world—and behold,\r\nsoaring up, hanging in the sky over a rude tumult of warehouses, over a\r\njostling competition of traders, irrelevantly beautiful and altogether\r\nremote, Saint Paul’s! “Of course!” one says, “Saint Paul’s!” It is the\r\nvery figure of whatever fineness the old Anglican culture achieved,\r\ndetached, a more dignified and chastened Saint Peter’s, colder, greyer,\r\nbut still ornate; it has never been over thrown, never disavowed, only\r\nthe tall warehouses and all the roar of traffic have forgotten it,\r\nevery one has forgotten it; the steamships, the barges, go heedlessly\r\nby regardless of it, intricacies of telephone wires and poles cut\r\nblackly into its thin mysteries, and presently, when in a moment the\r\ntraffic permits you and you look round for it, it has dissolved like a\r\ncloud into the grey blues of the London sky.\r\n\r\nAnd then the traditional and ostensible England falls from you\r\naltogether. The third movement begins, the last great movement in the\r\nLondon symphony, in which the trim scheme of the old order is\r\naltogether dwarfed and swallowed up. Comes London Bridge, and the great\r\nwarehouses tower up about you, waving stupendous cranes, the gulls\r\ncircle and scream in your ears, large ships lie among their lighters,\r\nand one is in the port of the world. Again and again in this book I\r\nhave written of England as a feudal scheme overtaken by fatty\r\ndegeneration and stupendous accidents of hypertrophy.\r\n\r\nFor the last time I must strike that note as the memory of the dear\r\nneat little sunlit ancient Tower of London lying away in a gap among\r\nthe warehouses comes back to me, that little accumulation of buildings\r\nso provincially pleasant and dignified, overshadowed by the vulgarest,\r\nmost typical exploit of modern England, the sham Gothic casings to the\r\nironwork of the Tower Bridge. That Tower Bridge is the very balance and\r\nconfirmation of Westminster’s dull pinnacles and tower. That sham\r\nGothic bridge; in the very gates of our mother of change, the Sea!\r\n\r\nBut after that one is in a world of accident and nature. For the third\r\npart of the panorama of London is beyond all law, order, and\r\nprecedence; it is the seaport and the sea. One goes down the widening\r\nreaches through a monstrous variety of shipping, great steamers, great\r\nsailing-ships, trailing the flags of all the world, a monstrous\r\nconfusion of lighters, witches’ conferences of brown-sailed barges,\r\nwallowing tugs, a tumultuous crowding and jostling of cranes and spars,\r\nand wharves and stores, and assertive inscriptions. Huge vistas of dock\r\nopen right and left of one, and here and there beyond and amidst it all\r\nare church towers, little patches of indescribably old-fashioned and\r\nworn-out houses, riverside pubs and the like, vestiges of townships\r\nthat were long since torn to fragments and submerged in these new\r\ngrowths. And amidst it all no plan appears, no intention, no\r\ncomprehensive desire. That is the very key of it all. Each day one\r\nfeels that the pressure of commerce and traffic grew, grew insensibly\r\nmonstrous, and first this man made a wharf and that erected a crane,\r\nand then this company set to work and then that, and so they jostled\r\ntogether to make this unassimilable enormity of traffic. Through it we\r\ndodged and drove eager for the high seas.\r\n\r\nI remember how I laughed aloud at the glimpse of the name of a London\r\nCounty Council steamboat that ran across me. _Caxton_ it was called,\r\nand another was _Pepys_, and another was _Shakespeare_. They seemed so\r\nwildly out of place, splashing about in that confusion. One wanted to\r\ntake them out and wipe them and put them back in some English\r\ngentleman’s library. Everything was alive about them, flash ing,\r\nsplashing, and passing, ships moving, tugs panting, hawsers taut,\r\nbarges going down with men toiling at the sweeps, the water all a-swirl\r\nwith the wash of shipping, scaling into millions of little wavelets,\r\ncurling and frothing under the whip of the unceasing wind. Past it all\r\nwe drove. And at Greenwich to the south, you know, there stands a fine\r\nstone frontage where all the victories are recorded in a Painted Hall,\r\nand beside it is the “Ship” where once upon a time those gentlemen of\r\nWestminster used to have an annual dinner—before the port of London got\r\ntoo much for them altogether. The old façade of the Hospital was just\r\nwarming to the sunset as we went by, and after that, right and left,\r\nthe river opened, the sense of the sea increased and prevailed, reach\r\nafter reach from Northfleet to the Nore.\r\n\r\nAnd out you come at last with the sun behind you into the eastern sea.\r\nYou speed up and tear the oily water louder and faster, siroo,\r\nsiroo-swish-siroo, and the hills of Kent—over which I once fled from\r\nthe Christian teachings of Nicodemus Frapp—fall away on the right hand\r\nand Essex on the left. They fall away and vanish into blue haze, and\r\nthe tall slow ships behind the tugs, scarce moving ships and wallowing\r\nsturdy tugs, are all wrought of wet gold as one goes frothing by. They\r\nstand out, bound on strange missions of life and death, to the killing\r\nof men in unfamiliar lands. And now behind us is blue mystery and the\r\nphantom flash of unseen lights, and presently even these are gone, and\r\nI and my destroyer tear out to the unknown across a great grey space.\r\nWe tear into the great spaces of the future and the turbines fall to\r\ntalking in unfamiliar tongues. Out to the open we go, to windy freedom\r\nand trackless ways. Light after light goes down. England and the\r\nKingdom, Britain and the Empire, the old prides and the old devotions,\r\nglide abeam, astern, sink down upon the horizon, pass—pass. The river\r\npasses—London passes, England passes...\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThis is the note I have tried to emphasise, the note that sounds clear\r\nin my mind when I think of anything beyond the purely personal aspects\r\nof my story.\r\n\r\nIt is a note of crumbling and confusion, of change and seemingly\r\naimless swelling, of a bubbling up and medley of futile loves and\r\nsorrows. But through the confusion sounds another note. Through the\r\nconfusion something drives, something that is at once human achievement\r\nand the most inhuman of all existing things. Something comes out of\r\nit.... How can I express the values of a thing at once so essential and\r\nso immaterial. It is something that calls upon such men as I with an\r\nirresistible appeal.\r\n\r\nI have figured it in my last section by the symbol of my destroyer,\r\nstark and swift, irrelevant to most human interests. Sometimes I call\r\nthis reality Science, sometimes I call it Truth. But it is something we\r\ndraw by pain and effort ont of the heart of life, that we disentangle\r\nand make clear. Other men serve it, I know, in art, in literature, in\r\nsocial invention, and see it in a thousand different figures, under a\r\nhundred names. I see it always as austerity, as beauty. This thing we\r\nmake clear is the heart of life. It is the one enduring thing. Men and\r\nnations, epochs and civilisation pass each making its contribution I do\r\nnot know what it is, this something, except that it is supreme. It is,\r\na something, a quality, an element, one may find now in colours, now in\r\nnorms, now in sounds, now in thoughts. It emerges from life with each\r\nyear one lives and feels, and generation by generation and age by age,\r\nbut the how and why of it are all beyond the compass of my mind....\r\n\r\nYet the full sense of it was with me all that night as I drove, lonely\r\nabove the rush and murmur of my engines, out upon the weltering circle\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nFar out to the northeast there came the flicker of a squadron of\r\nwarships waving white swords of light about the sky. I kept them\r\nhull-down, and presently they were mere summer lightning over the\r\nwatery edge of the globe.... I fell into thought that was nearly\r\nformless, into doubts and dreams that have no words, and it seemed good\r\nto me to drive ahead and on and or through the windy starlight, over\r\nthe long black waves.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt was morning and day before I returned with the four sick and\r\nstarving journalists who had got permission to come with me, up the\r\nshining river, and past the old grey Tower....\r\n\r\nI recall the back views of those journalists very distinctly, going\r\nwith a certain damp weariness of movement, along a side street away\r\nfrom the river. They were good men and bore me no malice, and they\r\nserved me up to the public in turgid degenerate Kiplingese, as a modest\r\nbutton on the complacent stomach of the Empire. Though as a matter of\r\nfact, X2 isn’t intended for the empire, or indeed for the hands of any\r\nEuropean power. We offered it to our own people first, but they would\r\nhave nothing to do with me, and I have long since ceased to trouble\r\nmuch about such questions. I have come to see myself from the outside,\r\nmy country from the outside—without illusions. We make and pass.\r\n\r\nWe are all things that make and pass striving upon a hidden mission,\r\nout to the open sea.",
