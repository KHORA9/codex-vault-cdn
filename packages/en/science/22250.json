When,\r\ntherefore, the sunny winter gave place to still more sunny spring, we\r\nset out upon our travels--first, eastward by sea to Philippeville, and\r\nthen southward to the desert.\r\n\r\nThe French colony of Algeria, as every one knows, stretches along the\r\nAfrican coast from Morocco to Tunis, and from the Mediterranean\r\nsouthward to the desert. It is divided into three provinces--Oran,\r\nAlgiers and Constantine, the central one being the most important and\r\nthat from which the whole country takes its name. From either of these\r\nprovinces it is possible to penetrate inland to the Sahara, but this is\r\ndone most easily from the eastern settlement, Constantine. We therefore\r\nmade choice of this route, and on a bright morning early in April\r\nstarted from Algiers for Philippeville. The voyage along the coast\r\naffords some glimpses of fine scenery. The Bay of Bougie especially,\r\nsurrounded as it is by lofty mountains, part of the Atlas range, is\r\nextremely picturesque. As the steamers, however, only remain a few hours\r\nat each of the stopping-places, there is scarcely time fully to enjoy\r\nthe varied and charming views. It seemed to us as if a vast diorama had\r\npassed before us, leaving on the mind not an indelible picture, but a\r\nmere shadowy outline of headlands and bays, rocky promontories and sunny\r\nsloping shores. With the exception of the port of Algiers, there is,\r\nproperly speaking, no harbor on this part of the African coast: there\r\nare only open roadsteads, where, exposed to the full roll of the sea,\r\nvessels ride uncomfortably at anchor. The journey is in consequence\r\nrather trying: nevertheless, we had not long reached terra firma before\r\nwe acknowledged ourselves amply compensated for the fatigues and little\r\nunpleasant accompaniments of the sea-voyage.\r\n\r\nPhilippeville offers to the traveller no great attractions. Its\r\nsituation is pretty, and it possesses some Roman remains, the\r\nexamination of which may occupy pleasantly and profitably enough the\r\nunavoidable interval between the landing and the start for the South.\r\nAfter resting but one night, we set out for Constantine, the capital of\r\nthe province of that name. There is nothing whatever of interest between\r\nthe sea and the city--nothing till you arrive within sight of\r\nConstantine itself. Then, indeed, when from the plain below you get your\r\nfirst view of the town, perched like an eagle's nest upon its rocky\r\nheight, you can at once realize the appropriateness of its singular\r\nname--\"the City in the Air.\" It is so high above you it seems midway\r\nbetween earth and heaven. Its situation is indeed unique and most\r\nstrangely picturesque. Security must have been the chief motive for the\r\nselection of such a site, and certainly few cities present more\r\nformidable barriers to the advance of a foe. The plateau of rock upon\r\nwhich the town is built forms a kind of peninsula, inaccessible on all\r\nsides except one, and there the ascent is long and steep, as we found to\r\nour cost each time we descended to the level of the valley. This plateau\r\nis joined to the rest of the table-land as by an isthmus: at all other\r\npoints it is surrounded by a profound chasm, through which flows the\r\nriver Roumel--a chasm so deep and narrow that it is only when quite near\r\nit you become aware of its existence. For the sake of internal safety a\r\nwall has been built round the top of the precipice, and at certain\r\npoints you may look over this parapet, sheer down some ten or twelve\r\nhundred feet, into an abyss fit only to be the habitation of the owls,\r\nbats, and birds of prey which frequent its solitudes. There seems no\r\nresting-place for any wingless creature: thus the strange birds which\r\nhaunt the wild recesses of the rocks do so in perfect security, and\r\ntheir varied cries, along with the roar of the water, are the only\r\nsounds that issue from below. The mysterious gloom is indescribable, and\r\nthe look down into the depths fills one with awe; and yet this singular\r\nview is obtained from the very town itself, from the courts and windows\r\nof the houses.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you would see this wonderful gorge to perfection, you must\r\ngo down into it and find your way to the little path which skirts the\r\nstream along a portion of its course. First, descend to the foot of the\r\nrock, where the river rushes out of the ravine with a mighty leap,\r\nforming a cascade some four hundred feet in height, and you are at once\r\noverwhelmed by the grandeur of the scene, and all the poetry in your\r\nnature is stirred. From this point you may proceed for some distance\r\nalong the water-side above the fall. Below you roars the foaming\r\ncataract, thundering downward and filling the whole air with its white\r\nspray. Above, on either side, are lofty, precipitous rocks, the crests\r\nof which are crowned by buildings. This is the town as seen from\r\nbeneath. No wonder it is called \"the City in the Air.\"\r\n\r\nAs you advance the chasm narrows. You must walk with caution, stepping\r\nlightly from rock to rock, till presently you come in sight of a lofty\r\narch, which, spanning the river from side to side, forms a gigantic\r\nnatural bridge joining the opposite sides of the gorge. Nothing in\r\nNature ever moved me more than the first view of that magnificent arch.\r\nWith something of the proportions of a cathedral roof it rises above you\r\nin massive grandeur, showing beyond, through the opening, a line of sky,\r\nand then another cavern-like arch. We could not penetrate farther, and\r\nno daylight issued from this second opening. It looked like the\r\nmysterious entrance into an underground world, the portal of Hades, and\r\nin the excitement produced by the novelty of the scene our surprise\r\ncould scarcely have been increased had some of the shades from the\r\nrealms of darkness glided out from amid the gloom, or if Charon's boat\r\nhad appeared to row us over the ferry. Overhead the hawks and eagles\r\ncircled round, and with hoarse cries appeared to express their anger at\r\nthe intrusion of man into these wilds sacred to them. Altogether, the\r\nscene is full of strange, awe-inspiring beauty. In the Alps and\r\nelsewhere we have, perhaps, beheld grander scenery, but never more\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\nThe town of Constantine has not much to commend it as a place of\r\nresidence. It is neither clean nor well built, while sights and smells\r\nthe reverse of agreeable are constantly distressing the optic and\r\nolfactory nerves. And yet there are perhaps few places where an artist\r\ncould find more charming subjects for his pencil--curious bits of\r\narchitecture mingling with Nature in its most beautiful and grandest\r\naspects, fine touches of brilliant color, and quaint winding streets and\r\nbazaars,--everywhere the picturesque. Filth and confusion, indeed, but\r\nstill it is the very confusion that an artist loves.\r\n\r\nThe people are a mixture of French, Arabs and Jews. Of the first nothing\r\nneed be said: they are the same everywhere. The second are similar in\r\ntype to the Arabs and Moors of the capital; but the last, the Jews, do\r\nnot at all resemble the specimens of the favored race we have been\r\naccustomed to meet with in Europe. They are mostly handsome, many of\r\nthem fair, the women being particularly gay and picturesque in costume,\r\nwearing, when in gala-dress, bright-colored, gold-bespangled scarfs\r\nhanging over their heads and shoulders. Altogether, we thought it the\r\nbrightest and most graceful female attire we had ever seen. But the most\r\ncharming of all are the children. We saw groups of a perfectly ideal\r\nbeauty playing upon the doorsteps and dust-heaps--little rosy-cheeked,\r\nfair or auburn-haired things, a striking contrast to the sallow Arab\r\nraces. In thus seeing that fair and auburn hair is not at all uncommon\r\namong the Jews of the East, we for the first time understood why the old\r\nmasters gave to Christ the complexion generally found in their\r\npaintings. Certainly, the Jewish children of Constantine would make most\r\nlovely studies for the genre painter, and we all regretted that we could\r\nnot carry away with us some enduring souvenir of that which had charmed\r\nus so much.\r\n\r\nBut, however picturesque the country, and however interesting the town\r\nand people, we cannot always linger here. Our destination is the desert.\r\nThus, therefore, after a few days spent in alternate wonder and\r\nadmiration, we once again set out on our southward course, resolved to\r\nindemnify ourselves on our return journey by making a longer stay amidst\r\nthe beautiful and extremely singular scenery of the Roumel.\r\n\r\nOur next resting-place was Batna, a small French town situated on the\r\nelevated ground--nearly four thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea--between the Mediterranean and the Sahara. We had to make the\r\njourney thither by diligence and by night, and we were surprised to find\r\nhow cold an African night can be even in April. There was a hard frost,\r\nand just before entering Batna we passed under an aqueduct from which\r\nhung down a fringe of enormous icicles. The following day, on the still\r\nhigher ground at the celebrated cedar forest, which forms an interesting\r\nexcursion from Batna, we found deep snow. During the day the sun shone\r\nout bright and powerful, but the nights continued to hold the forest\r\nfrost-bound.\r\n\r\nAt Batna we met with a party of gentlemen, one of whom we had known\r\nslightly in Algiers; and they, like ourselves, were bound for Biskra.\r\nThis complicated matters, as it was understood that the accommodation at\r\nthe oasis was of a somewhat scanty description. They were three, and we\r\nwere four--altogether, a party of six gentlemen and one lady. We\r\ntelegraphed from Batna to ascertain whether or not we could all get\r\nrooms. Our despair may be imagined when we received the answer: one of\r\nthe little hotels was closed, and the other could only offer us two\r\nrooms. Two rooms for seven people! What was to be done? We could not--or\r\nrather would not--retrace our steps at this stage, and thus give up the\r\nvery object of our journey; so we resolved to go on at all risks and\r\ntake our chance.\r\n\r\nThe evening before we started on our somewhat adventurous journey, as we\r\nsat chatting round the fire, I could not help giving vent to my\r\nfeelings. The desert! Was it possible? I felt myself on the eve of\r\nsomething momentous. It was an event in my life, a something never to be\r\nforgotten. A smile played upon the faces of my companions, and next day,\r\nwhen, utterly worn and weary, I could with difficulty take an interest\r\nin anything around me, they were very ready to banter me about \"the\r\nevent in my life.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not without serious misgivings that we took our places in the\r\ngreat lumbering vehicle which travels twice a week between Batna and the\r\noasis. Nothing but a heavy, strongly-built conveyance could stand the\r\njolting of such a journey; and in order to accomplish it at all within\r\nthe day it is necessary to start between two and three o'clock in the\r\nmorning. Now, if there is one thing more than another likely to damp\r\none's enthusiasm, it is turning out at such an untimely hour. We all\r\nfelt this as we wended our way through the cold, dark streets to the\r\ndiligence-office; and as we were trundled down the steep hill leading\r\nout of the town, bumping from side to side, it was some time before we\r\ncould recover our spirits or stir up again an excitement worthy of the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nOn the route between Batna and El Kantra--\"the Mouth of the\r\nDesert\"--there is little of interest. It is a weary journey, over roads\r\neither badly made or not made at all, through a bare, barren, bleak,\r\nuncultivated country. One wonders, in passing through such an\r\ninhospitable region, at finding so many remains of the Roman occupation.\r\nWhat could have induced such a people to penetrate so far into the wilds\r\nof Africa? There is no evidence of the land ever having been more\r\nproductive or more attractive than it is at present; and yet at\r\nLambessa, a few miles from Batna, you find the ruins of a once great and\r\nmagnificent Roman city, while even as far south as Biskra itself there\r\nare still to be seen relics of this great conquering nation of\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nBut to return to El Kantra. Here we found a little hotel kept by French\r\npeople, and here the diligence stopped for breakfast. It was about ten\r\no'clock, and what a change! The heat was broiling, and the dry, arid\r\nrocks told of an approach to the desert. In effect, the Pass of El\r\nKantra is the entrance to what is called \"the Little Desert;\" hence its\r\nname, \"Mouth of the Desert.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the valley seems completely shut in by a mountainous\r\nbarrier of rugged rock. On advancing, however, a few steps farther, the\r\ngreat jagged rocks, which appeared a compact mass, divide, and, like the\r\ntransformation-scene in a pantomime, the oasis of El Kantra, which is\r\nsituated immediately south of the pass, lies before you. The opening is\r\nso narrow that it affords but room for the road and the stream, which is\r\ncrossed by a bridge of Roman construction, restored by the late emperor\r\nNapoleon. It is therefore only when close upon it, when actually within\r\nthe pass, that you become aware of the singularly beautiful scene\r\nbeyond.[A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OASIS OF EL KANTRA.]\r\n\r\nOn each side the great mountain-masses rise, picturesque, even\r\nfantastic, in outline. The heights are inaccessible to any foot but\r\nthose of the goat and goatherd. We were astonished at seeing a troop of\r\ngoats wending their way upward, for to our eyes there seemed not even\r\nthe remotest trace of vegetation upon the rocks; and indeed the poor\r\nthings looked as if with them existence were truly \"a struggle,\" out of\r\nwhich little could be gained by natural selection.\r\n\r\nHungry as we were on arriving at El Kantra after our long ride, we could\r\nscarcely take time to breakfast, but hurried on in advance of the\r\ndiligence to get our first view of the mysterious land beyond the\r\nmountain-range. The stream which here descends from the hills to the\r\nplain causes the desert, if not \"to blossom like a rose,\" to become at\r\nthis point a rich and beautiful oasis. Here, for the first time, we saw\r\nthe date-palm in full luxuriance. In the neighborhood of Algiers there\r\nare many fine trees, but the fruit never thoroughly ripens there.\r\n\r\nFor upward of a mile after passing through the mountain-gorge we skirted\r\nthe oasis. It is surrounded by a mud-built wall, and half hidden among\r\nthe palms we could discern the mud-built cottages and mosque belonging\r\nto the Arab village. On the other side of our route we observed a forest\r\nof upright stones, rough and unhewn. This was the last resting-place of\r\nthe people of the desert, and a sad and lonely sight an Arab\r\nburial-place is, dreary even amid the utter desolation around.\r\n\r\nNow and then as we advanced we met troops of camels with their owners\r\ngoing north ward to the Tell, or cultivated lands, carrying with them\r\ntheir wives and other goods and chattels. Or, again, we would come upon\r\nthe huge bleached carcass of one of those all-important beasts of\r\nburden, which had fallen on one of its weary journeys and left its bones\r\nto whiten upon the sand. Or we would see in the distance a hyena or\r\njackal prowling about in search of more recent dead.\r\n\r\nEverything was so novel and strange to us that for a long time pleasure\r\nand excitement prevented our yielding to, or even feeling, fatigue. As,\r\nhowever, the day advanced and the heat became more and more intolerable,\r\nas the glare blinded us and the dust half smothered us, again our\r\nspirits sank and the pleasure of \"this event in life\" assumed a doubtful\r\nhue. Even when the spirit is willing the flesh is weak, and we were\r\nbeginning to feel thoroughly worn out when the diligence pulled up on\r\nthe top of the range of hills which divides the Little Desert from the\r\nSahara proper.\r\n\r\nAt last we beheld it--the Great Desert! \"The sea! how like the sea!\" we\r\nall exclaimed; and indeed there it lay like a vast expanse of calm\r\nocean. The slopes of the hills upon which we stood appeared like the\r\nshore, and those distant black-gray spots surrounded by a seeming blue,\r\nso wonderfully like islands in the ocean, were the oases of the Ziban,\r\nencircled by the great sea of sand, the desert. It is a view never to be\r\nforgotten--such light! such color! such calm loveliness!\r\n\r\nFatigue, discomfort, difficulties, all alike were forgotten; self seemed\r\nlost in the magic of the scene; and it was with straining eyes and\r\nbeating hearts that we rattled down the declivity to Biskra, the\r\nlargest, richest and most important of this group of oases. But here\r\nagain our troubles commenced. This journey seemed fated to be, like the\r\njourney of life itself, a series of ups and downs, calculated to fully\r\nexercise all our strength and philosophy. It was no joke to find\r\nourselves in the desert, after a drive of fifteen hours, without a\r\nresting-place for our wearied bodies or a dinner to restore our failing\r\nstrength and spirits. One hotel, we found, was indeed shut up, and in\r\nthe other they had only two close, wretched-looking rooms to offer\r\nus--one with two, and one with three, beds. We were very reluctant to\r\naccept these; and, after all, how could seven persons, a lady and six\r\ngentlemen, be thus accommodated? Mr. M---- and I determined to lay siege\r\nto the closed hotel and try if we could not find an \"open sesame\" to\r\nunclose its portals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISKRA.]\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame Bourguignon, the landlord and landlady, were the\r\nsole occupants of the hotel. It was impossible, they said: they dared\r\nnot admit us, as in consequence of a quarrel with the authorities their\r\nlicense had been taken from them. At last our importunity triumphed. On\r\nappealing to their humanity in our most pathetic and touching French,\r\nthey said if we could get a written permission from the\r\n_commandant-superieur_ for them to open their hotel, they would do the\r\nbest they could for us. We had no resource but to beat up the officer's\r\nquarters, which, under the conduct of an Arab guide, we soon reached.\r\nThe servant who answered our summons said, \"Monsieur le Commandant was\r\nat dinner.\" Politeness, however, was at this stage of the proceedings\r\nout of the question; so we coolly replied that he must leave his dinner\r\nand come to speak with a lady. We were not long kept waiting, and were\r\nmost kindly and pleasantly received, the commandant giving us at once a\r\nnote to M. Bourguignon requesting him, as a personal favor, to do all he\r\ncould to make us comfortable, adding, with true French politeness, that\r\nhe only regretted that in his bachelor quarters he had not himself\r\naccommodation to offer us.\r\n\r\nThus, one more of our troubles was happily ended, and in a wonderfully\r\nshort space of time we found ourselves refreshing exhausted Nature with\r\nan excellent dinner, waited upon by our jolly landlord, who constantly\r\nassured us that we should be very comfortable, \"car on mange tres bien a\r\nBiskra.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only on becoming acquainted with scenes and people which we have\r\nbeen in the habit of picturing to ourselves that we realize how feeble a\r\npower is the imagination. We found here everything so different from the\r\ncreations of our fancy. My idea of an oasis, for example, had been a\r\nclump of trees, a spring of water and a little verdure. Here we found\r\none several miles in length, and with sixty thousand palm trees, a\r\nconsiderable population, a market and a fort. Biskra is, however, the\r\nlargest and finest of the group of oases which stud this part of the\r\ndesert. It is the place of residence of the caid and the chief seat of\r\nArab commerce.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had dined it was already too dark to commence\r\nexplorations. It was only the next morning, when we rose refreshed and\r\nrested, that we began to take in the various details of the new and\r\nsingular life to which we were being introduced.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to our hotel. It consisted of a row of small, self-contained\r\nhouses forming two sides of a square. One of these little dwellings was\r\nthe dining-room, another the kitchen, and the others respectively the\r\nguests' sleeping-chambers, a separate house being allotted to each. In\r\nthe centre of the square there was a charming garden, where roses,\r\nsweet-peas and most of our summer flowers were blooming in full\r\nluxuriance. Then, in the early season, when the springs give out their\r\nfertilizing moisture and the sun has not yet attained its full scorching\r\npower, the garden is one mass of beauty and blossom: later in the year\r\neverything becomes parched and dried up, scarcely a blade remaining. In\r\nthe middle of the garden there was a bower overgrown with creepers and\r\nshaded by a thick matting. This formed our saloon and reception-room,\r\nand here we took our coffee, the gentlemen smoked their cigars and we\r\nchatted over our adventures and prospects. Our rooms, or little houses,\r\nall opened on the garden; and never can we forget the charm of unclosing\r\nour door in the early morning. What a flood of light and freshness and\r\nfragrance rushed in upon us while we dressed and prepared for the\r\nbusiness of the day! Our apartment had a bare stone floor, its furniture\r\nconsisted of two beds, two chairs and a deal table--nothing could have\r\nbeen more simple--yet this little nest in the desert appeared to us\r\nabout the nearest imaginable approach to an earthly paradise. How we\r\ncongratulated ourselves upon having had the courage to leave the dingy\r\nrooms at the other hotel to our travelling companions, and to force an\r\nentrance into this sweet spot! Our hosts, too, seemed delighted and most\r\nhappy at having guests in their house once more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEGRO VILLAGE AT BISKRA.]\r\n\r\nEvery morning we rose at five, took tea in our arbor before six, and\r\nthen sallied out to explore and photograph till ten, when we returned to\r\nbreakfast. Then we retired either to our own apartments, or, if not too\r\nhot, to the shade of the garden, and did the _dolce far niente_ till the\r\nsun had passed the zenith and had begun to sink in the west. Then,\r\nagain, on foot or donkey-back, we visited the different parts of the\r\noasis, returning in time for a six-o'clock dinner; after which, the room\r\nusually becoming insufferably hot, we once more sought our open-air\r\ndrawing-room and took our evening coffee by the light of the stars.\r\n\r\nMere existence in such an atmosphere is bliss. One does not seem to\r\nbreathe, as at home, machine-like, just what is necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of life, but, exhilarated with the pureness and freshness,\r\none drinks in long breaths of pleasure. It would be difficult to give an\r\nidea of the charm of our morning and evening rambles--the delicious\r\nshade, the beautiful light and shadow, the sweet wafts of warm aromatic\r\nfragrance, the refreshing murmur of the numberless runlets of\r\nwater--everything so calm, so full of dreamy beauty.\r\n\r\nWhat the Nile is to Egypt, the stream which flows here is to Biskra. By\r\nconsiderable labor it has been made to meander among the palms in\r\nnumerous tiny canals, thus by an elaborate system of irrigation causing\r\nthe barren soil of the desert to become fertile and bring forth fruit.\r\nEverywhere the little runlets are led round the very roots of the trees,\r\nfor the palm, it is said, loves to have its head in the fire and its\r\nfeet in the water. Here and there even a few cereals are extracted from\r\nthe unwilling soil. At the time of our visit, in April, it was\r\nharvest-time, and the husbandman was busy gathering in his little store.\r\nThe date-harvest, which constitutes the chief wealth of the district,\r\ndoes not take place till October.\r\n\r\nBesides the town proper and the fort, there is at Biskra a negro\r\nvillage, while scattered throughout the oasis there are numerous\r\nmud-built mosques and cottages, which contrast charmingly with the\r\ntropical vegetation and add greatly to the picturesque beauty of the\r\nscene. In addition to these abodes of the settled population, there are\r\nalso groups of real black Arab tents, which form the habitations of the\r\nmore nomadic races. These are here to-day and away to-morrow, carrying\r\nall their possessions with them. The troops of Arabs we had met _en\r\nroute_ belonged to these wandering tribes, and were going to the Tell\r\ncountry for summer pasturage. While we were at Biskra there was a\r\nwedding in one of these dingy black tents, and a very queer place it\r\nseemed to us to bring a bride to; nevertheless, she was conducted\r\nthither in triumph, riding upon a mule, while the Arabs in front of the\r\ntent fired _feu-de-joie_ amid the most noisy demonstrations of welcome\r\nand rejoicing.\r\n\r\nWithin the town there are several streets, some large open places, and a\r\ncovered market-hall, where a brisk trade is daily carried on, large\r\nquantities of dates, small quantities of grain, cutlery--knives and\r\ndaggers with roughly-hewn wooden sheaths--primitive musical instruments,\r\nembroidered leather caps, straps, tobacco-pouches, etc., being exposed\r\nin the various stalls. Altogether, a singular medley, and quite unlike\r\nany European market.\r\n\r\nThe wild music of the tom-tom, a primitive Arab drum, seemed to us never\r\nto cease at Biskra. At night, when we retired to rest, it was drumming\r\nin our ears, and in the morning, when we awoke, its monotonous tones\r\nstill floated on the air. At all hours of the day and night the cafes\r\nare frequented by pleasure-seekers. Hence the incessant drumming, as the\r\nmusic of the tom-tom seems to be an indispensable adjunct to Arab\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice we made a round of the cafes, and very grim and solemn the\r\nentertainment appeared to us. In one, for example, which was crowded\r\nwith tall grave men calmly puffing at their pipes and sipping their\r\ncoffee, we found a danseuse performing--a tall female figure, who glided\r\nand swayed about in the mazes of a strange dance, while the musician sat\r\ncross-legged in a corner of the room playing the inevitable tom-tom.\r\nThis Arab danseuse was as unlike our performers of the ballet as she\r\nwell could be. Her clothing was a loose flowing drapery, which fell from\r\nher shoulders to her heels, while instead of agility of motion or\r\nsprightliness there was nothing but a dreamy gliding, a kind of\r\nsomnambulistic movement, apparently without plan or purpose, but not\r\nwithout a certain grace. In another cafe two children were pulling each\r\nother about in a less graceful and equally meaningless dance; while in a\r\nthird we found a professional story-teller holding forth in earnest\r\ntones to a group gathered closely round him. From the looks of the\r\nspectators it was impossible to say whether or not they took pleasure in\r\nthe various performances. During the time we remained we beheld not a\r\nmovement of applause: not a smile relaxed the grave, stolid features;\r\nthere was but a calm gazing and a quiet puffing of smoke from mouth and\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\nA day or two after our arrival we deemed it our duty to call upon the\r\ncommandant to thank him for his politeness, and to tell him how well\r\nsatisfied we were with our quarters at the Hotel Bourguignon. Seated\r\nwith him we found the great man of the district, the caid, making a\r\nmorning call. It was our first introduction to a real Arab gentleman,\r\nand we regretted exceedingly that we could not converse with him in his\r\nown language, the more especially as he was a travelled man. He had been\r\nto Paris, had been received at the Tuileries by the emperor Napoleon,\r\nand had made the grand Mohammedan pilgrimage to Mecca. But as a\r\nconversation with Arabs, conducted as ours was through the medium of a\r\nFrench interpreter, is necessarily restricted, we had little opportunity\r\nof judging whether or not the mind of the caid corresponded with his\r\nhandsome exterior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARAB CAMP NEAR BISKRA.]\r\n\r\nOn my mentioning that I had a great desire to try a camel-ride, the caid\r\nvolunteered to send camels for our party, and to see that mine was\r\nproperly caparisoned for the comfort and accommodation of a lady; and\r\nalso to send his son to attend to my safety. Of course we accepted his\r\npolite offer, and the afternoon of the same day was fixed for the\r\nexpedition. Never can we forget the sight which presented itself to our\r\nastonished eyes when we went to our hotel-door at the appointed hour.\r\nThere was the lady's camel, with a howdah on its back hung with\r\ncurtains of damask and gold. There were the camels for the gentlemen,\r\neach led by its swarthy driver, while alongside a young Arab gentleman\r\ncareered upon a white charger with crimson and gold saddle and\r\ntrappings, followed by a mounted attendant almost equally magnificent.\r\nTo crown the whole, or at least give it state, there were some two or\r\nthree hundred Arab spectators. Only once before had such a scene been\r\nwitnessed in Biskra, when some years previously the wife of a French\r\ngeneral had visited the oasis.\r\n\r\nIt was not without considerable difficulty that we got started. The\r\ncamels are made to kneel, and thus it is easy enough to mount, but then\r\nbegins the ordeal. While the huge beast raises itself on its\r\ndouble-jointed limbs you undergo a series of painful jerks which nothing\r\nbut the most undaunted courage enables you to endure. Determination,\r\nhowever, overcomes all difficulties, and at last our cortege was en\r\nroute. The mounted attendant acted as outrider to clear the way, while\r\nhe of the milk-white steed, the caid's son, rode gallantly by my side.\r\n\r\nI could have fancied myself a queen of Sheba or some Eastern houri\r\nscreened by silken curtains from the vulgar gaze. What extravagances my\r\nimagination in its pride might have led me into it is impossible to say,\r\nbut for the bodily discomfort. The camel is called the \"ship of the\r\ndesert,\" but surely no ship ever pitched and rolled so unmercifully. The\r\nhowdah too, which was loosely slung upon the creature's back, only added\r\nto the naturally uncomfortable motion. In fact, this cage-like erection\r\nwas only kept in its place by ropes attached to it which were held by\r\ntwo men who walked one on each side. As the thing swung one way, the man\r\nopposite pulled it back, and _vice versa_, altogether regardless of my\r\nfeelings in the matter.\r\n\r\nWe have since found out, by experience in Egypt, that these camels were\r\nof what may be called the cart-horse breed, and there is about as much\r\ndifference in riding such a one and a properly-trained dromedary as\r\nthere is between a dray-horse and a thoroughbred. Thus, if we were proud\r\nof our exaltation, we paid dearly for our pride, and when we returned\r\nfrom our excursion it was with a feeling of every limb being out of\r\njoint. It was days before we had completely recovered from the effects\r\nof this our first and, as I devoutly hoped, our last camel-ride. From\r\nthis time forward the caid's son, who spoke French tolerably well, paid\r\nus almost daily visits, and although he had never been beyond the bounds\r\nof the desert, we have never met with more pleasing, gentlemanly manners\r\nthan those of this young Arab.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he invited me to pay a visit to the ladies of his family.\r\nThese poor creatures are never allowed to go out except into their\r\nhigh-walled garden, and no male eyes but those of near relatives are\r\never allowed to gaze upon them. They do not even take their meals with\r\ntheir husbands and sons, this being contrary to Arab ideas of propriety.\r\nThus, while they have no outdoor life, they have no indoor social life\r\neither. There is nothing for them but to be drudges and mothers, to bear\r\nand to bring up children. It is therefore not surprising that the first\r\nquestion Arab women ask is, \"Have you any children?\" or that they should\r\nentertain the profoundest pity for those of their sisterhood who are not\r\nthus blessed. To them motherhood is the one thing worth living for: all\r\nelse is denied to them by the barbarous customs of their country.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our travels we have met with one educated Arab lady,\r\nand, singular to say, both she and her husband objected to educating\r\ntheir daughters. Probably she felt that in the life to which she was by\r\nArab custom condemned education did not add to her own happiness--that\r\nit was fitted, indeed, only to raise aspirations and desires which could\r\nnever be realized.\r\n\r\nThe house of the caid was clean and airy, and characterized by a certain\r\nbarbaric taste. There were arms suspended upon the walls, Persian rugs\r\nlaid upon the floors and divans placed around the rooms. The large\r\ngarden was pleasant, being beautifully shaded by palms and orange and\r\nlemon trees. In it there was a summer-house, where it was the custom of\r\nthe gentlemen of the family to dine and take their coffee. Everywhere\r\nthere was an air of wealth and comfort, but yet to an English eye there\r\nwas a want of neatness and trimness in all the arrangements, both of\r\nhouse and garden.\r\n\r\nI saw only one of the ladies, the wife of the caid, the last survivor\r\nout of some five or six. She was elderly and not beautiful, her dress\r\ngay rather than tasteful, and upon the whole less rich than I expected,\r\nconsidering the immense wealth of her husband. We were assured he\r\npossessed four thousand camels, besides boundless wealth in date-palms,\r\netc. Through my young Arab friend, who acted as interpreter, she told me\r\nI was welcome, and then as soon as we were seated she began an\r\nexamination of my dress and ornaments. She seemed, indeed, in mind a\r\nperfect child, incapable of taking an interest in anything higher than\r\ndress and trinkets. To her, the great world without was a complete\r\nblank, a sealed book: the field of her observations was bounded by the\r\nfour walls of her own abode, while books and society were alike\r\nforbidden. Certainly, if the fruit of the tree of knowledge be evil,\r\nthen Arab women should be virtuous indeed, from them it is so well\r\nguarded. Taking my cue from my hostess, and supposing it Arab\r\npoliteness, I also made an inspection of her dress, and especially of\r\nher earrings, which had at once attracted my attention on account of\r\ntheir great size. They were gold hoops of from two to three inches in\r\ndiameter, thick and heavy, and set with a mass of stones and pearls. It\r\nseemed marvellous how any human ears could support such pendants. In\r\neffect, I found that they did not do so. The earrings were only sham,\r\nfor in reality they were fixed to her head-dress, and were only so\r\narranged as to appear suspended from the ears.\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to this visit, Madame Bourguignon asked me if I should\r\nlike to see an Arab _menage_ of the humbler order. The family to whose\r\nhouse she conducted me were neighbors and proteges of hers. From the\r\noutside, this house, like most Arab houses, presented a dead wall broken\r\nonly by a doorway. Through this we entered into an unpaved court, where\r\nthe family was assembled. The owner or master of the establishment was\r\nsquatted upon the dry sandy ground, with three or four young children\r\nsprawling round him, while his _four_ wives were occupied with their\r\nrespective duties. Two were suckling babies, one was weaving a kind of\r\ncoarse striped material in a primitive loom, while the fourth was\r\napparently attending to the business of housekeeping. In addition to\r\nthese, there were several older children playing among the sand: the\r\ngrown-up members of the family were out, I was informed, begging,\r\nworking, or perhaps stealing, as they might happen to find opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe man was not bad-looking, and one or two of the children were almost\r\npretty, notwithstanding the dirt and swarms of flies that half concealed\r\ntheir features; but the women! Well, most men would have thought one\r\nsuch wife enough. I certainly marvelled at any one choosing four, and\r\nalso that a man in such circumstances should be able to support so many.\r\nOn expressing my surprise to Madame Bourguignon, she exclaimed, \"He does\r\nnot support them: it is they who support him.\" Thus the smaller a man's\r\nmeans and the greater his wants the more wives he needs.\r\n\r\nWe had ample proof that these wretched women are often treated as little\r\nbetter than beasts of burden. Nearer the \"Mouth of the Desert\" we saw\r\ntroops of women carrying enormous burdens of sticks upon their backs,\r\nwhich they had collected somewhere north of the mountains, while their\r\nlords and masters strutted along unencumbered at their sides, acting the\r\npart of slave-drivers. Even among the wealthy Arabs it is common for the\r\nwives to be employed in the most menial household work; and Madame\r\nBourguignon assured me that had I been behind the scenes I should\r\nprobably have found some of the ladies of the caid's family thus\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the house. The open court into which we entered, and\r\nwhere we found the family assembled, was evidently their living-room\r\nduring the day. Four small apartments opened out of it. First, the\r\nkitchen, the whole furnishing of which consisted of a few fire-bricks,\r\none or two vessels for cooking and a skin for holding water. The other\r\nthree apartments were respectively the sleeping-room of the master of\r\nthe house, that of the women and that of the elder children; and,\r\nliterally, the only furniture of these was a piece of boarding covered\r\nwith matting. There was no bedding, no bed-clothing, no attempt at\r\ncomfort of any kind. It is certainly not an expensive matter to set up\r\nhouse at Biskra, the climate of the desert making one independent of\r\neverything except a shade from the sun and a little food to sustain\r\nlife. From the court a stair led up to the flat roof which covered in\r\nthe four apartments, and this upper story formed the receptacle for all\r\nthe filth of the family. The scene was disgusting in the extreme. In any\r\nother climate it must have bred a pestilence. Here, no doubt, this dire\r\nresult is prevented by the extreme dryness of the atmosphere. After this\r\nvisit I quite appreciated our good landlady's horror of the Arabs. \"You\r\nsee now,\" said she, \"how it is I cannot bear even to buy fowls fed by\r\nsuch people.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the time we remained at Biskra we only twice made excursions\r\nbeyond the limits of the oasis--once to some hot sulphur springs a few\r\nmiles out in the desert--springs of such wonderful efficacy in all\r\nrheumatic affections that were they in Europe they would speedily make\r\nthe fortune of any watering-place. Here they are little known: however,\r\na bath has been formed and roofed in, and our gentlemen enjoyed a dip in\r\nthe warm water after their ride across the desert. From this bath one\r\nof them dated the cure of a severe pain in the leg which had caused him\r\nmuch inconvenience during the journey. Our other excursion was to the\r\nneighboring oasis of Sidi Okba, the ecclesiastical, as Biskra is the\r\ncommercial, capital of the Ziban. Judging by appearances, one would say\r\nthat commerce must be a much more thriving thing than religion, for Sidi\r\nOkba is in every way inferior to Biskra. The people are more squalid,\r\nthe houses more wretched: the very mosque itself is in a dirty,\r\ntumble-down condition. Here we found no Arabs who could speak French;\r\nand at one time, having lost our way among the palms, we were very much\r\nat a loss to know what to do. For some time we tried in vain to catch a\r\nglimpse of the mosque, thinking that it, beacon-like, would guide us\r\nback to the town. Equally in vain we interrogated all the Arabs we met\r\nin all the languages at our command, and it was only at last, inspired\r\nby desperation, that we hit upon the expedient of signs. Assuming the\r\nattitude of prayer, we called out, \"Allah! Allah!\" An Arab at once\r\nanswered \"Marabout! marabout!\" and then we remembered that this was the\r\nname for mosque, and nodded, \"Yes, marabout.\" He seemed delighted at\r\nhaving understood us at last, and soon led us to the mosque, from whence\r\nwe knew our way to the place where we had left our luncheon. We had\r\ncrossed the desert in the early morning, and were obliged to seek a\r\nresting-place in the shade during the hot hours of the day. This we\r\nfound in a house belonging to a son of the caid of Biskra. There we ate\r\nthe luncheon we had brought with us, and then we reclined upon the\r\nPersian carpets and rested till the hour arrived when we could safely\r\nundertake the return journey.\r\n\r\nThe day after our visit to Sidi Okba was our last at Biskra. We bade\r\nadieu to it with regret, and we shall always remember the time spent in\r\nthis oasis of Sahara as among the white days in our calendar.\r\n\r\n    J.P.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] [For the use of the wood-cut presenting a view of the oasis of El\r\nKantra we are indebted to the kindness of Mr. John Murray of Albemarle\r\nstreet, London.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN KASHMIR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF A TEMPLE OF MARTAND (OLD SRINAGAR).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe topographically inclined among biblical commentators might select a\r\ngreat many more unlikely spots for the Garden of Eden than Kashmir. The\r\nfour rivers are there--the Indus, the Jhelam, the Chenab and the Ravi.\r\nTheir banks present the widest possible variety of rock, soil,\r\nvegetation and animal life. The palm and pomegranate are at home in the\r\nvalleys, and the dwarf willow and birch are frozen out a long way below\r\nthe summits of the mountains. The tiger and the ptarmigan are, measured\r\nvertically, close neighbors, a mile or two apart, within easy calling\r\ndistance. Man is equally multiform. All his races are assembled save the\r\nAfrican. His extremes in physiognomy, dress, government and religion are\r\nbrought into close communion. Character, in this cosmopolitan district,\r\ngives place to eclecticism. Its features and its occupants represent the\r\nwhole world, and might readily refurnish it were all the rest of its\r\nsurface laid desolate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUBURB OF SRINAGAR.]\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the idea of a garden has always associated itself with\r\nKashmir. Eastern poets and historians speak of it as a garden\r\ncollectively, and lavish their most brilliant powers of description on\r\nthe gardens which make it up in detail--the gardens of the terraced\r\nhills, the gardens of the broad alluvial plain, and the floating gardens\r\nof the lakes Wular and Dal. These last, more fortunate than those of\r\nBabylon and Nineveh, have maintained their existence to our day, the\r\naquatic cultivator rowing among his parterres and gathering his melons\r\nover the gunwale. Fertility has never failed. The permanence in beauty\r\nand productiveness designed for Eden has here been sustained by the\r\nharmoniously-acting forces of Nature, and Adam might, for all that the\r\nexplorers tell us to the contrary, have lived in Kashmir after his\r\nprimitive fashion till now. He would, however, have been compelled in\r\nsome degree to modify his taste in regard to clothing, unless he\r\nconfined himself the year through to the valley, ninety miles by twenty,\r\nwhich strictly bears the name. A winter suit would have been\r\nindispensable to his excursions among the bordering mountains, which\r\nswell from an elevation of ten thousand feet above tide to twenty-two,\r\nand even, on the extreme limits of the region now officially named\r\nKashmir, to twenty-eight thousand. As to antiquity, time is, like\r\neverything else, on a grand scale in Kashmir. Her earliest dynasty, the\r\nPandu, runs far into the life of the first father, having come to an end\r\ntwenty-five hundred years before Christ, after a duration of thirteen\r\nhundred years, if we are to believe Baron Huegel, an archaeologist of the\r\ngood old German type, who is daunted by no figures, and who simply\r\n\"reminds the reader,\" as he would of what he had for dinner yesterday,\r\nof the stunning chronology here cited. To the epoch of that primeval\r\ndynasty the baron assigns the building of the great temple of Martand,\r\nthe ruins of which delight all travellers and excite to the use of such\r\nepithets as \"wonderful\" and \"glorious\" the impassive Wilson. He declares\r\nthat they are quite superior to anything architectural around them, and\r\n\"might yet vie with the finest remains of Greek and Roman architecture.\"\r\nThe temple stands solitary on a stretch of table-land four hundred feet\r\nabove the valley and ten leagues east of the capital. Tradition avers,\r\npartly on the strength of several ancient beaches still distinctly\r\nmarked, that the whole valley was under water when the temple was built,\r\nand that it originally stood upon the immediate shore. This generally\r\nunreliable guide even goes into details and grows statistical,\r\nmentioning the year 266 B.C.as the epoch of the sudden shrinking of the\r\nwaters to what--or nearly what, for desiccation is said to be still\r\ngoing on--is seen of them now. This becomes less incredible in the light\r\nof the extraordinary oscillations of level in the streams and lakes with\r\nwhich the present inhabitants are familiar. In 1858 the Indus rose, at a\r\npoint below its exit from the mountains, one hundred and sixty feet in\r\ntwenty-four hours, its rise in the narrow defiles above having been of\r\ncourse greater. A single pool, temporarily formed on the slopes of the\r\nmighty Nanga Parbat by the melting of the snow in 1850, was a mile and a\r\nhalf long by half a mile wide and three hundred feet deep--just so much\r\ndevastation \"cocked and primed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARI PARBAT, CITADEL OF SRINAGAR.]\r\n\r\nThe modern state of Kashmir dates from 1846, when the Sikh empire, of\r\nwhich it was a part, was overthrown by the British. Golab Singh, who had\r\nmade himself useful to the Indian government, was placed over it as\r\nmaharajah, with a show of independence, but real subordination. He fixed\r\nhis capital at Jummoo, in the extreme south of his dominions and within\r\neasy reach of Lahore. The name _Jummoo_ is given by the natives to his\r\nwhole territory, although the province of that name is, so far as\r\ngeographical extent goes, a mere fragment of it. The provinces of Jummoo\r\nand Kashmir, immediately north of it, comprise together about a third of\r\nthe aggregate of sixty-eight thousand square miles. Their share of the\r\npopulation is infinitely greater in proportion. Out of a total, in 1873,\r\nof 1,534,972 souls, the province of Jummoo contained 861,075--44,000 of\r\nthem in the city of that name, the political metropolis. The government\r\nof Kashmir had 491,846, including 136,000 in the city of Srinagar. The\r\ndistrict of Punch, which boasts a rajah of its own, tributary to the\r\nmaharajah, had 77,566, and the outlying governments, as they are termed,\r\nof Gilgit in the extreme north-east, Baltistan in the north, and Ladakh,\r\nor Little Tibet, in the east, 104,485 together. In the province of\r\nKashmir the Mohammedans are in the large majority of six to one. In that\r\nof Jummoo, on the contrary, the excess is slightly in favor of the\r\nHindus--a circumstance which accounts for the sovereign's choice of a\r\ncapital, he being a Hindu and showing in his political acts a preference\r\nfor his co-religionists and a corresponding distrust of his Moslem\r\nsubjects. In Ladakh, Budha is supreme, his worshippers numbering 20,254\r\nto 260 followers of Islam and 107 adherents of the Vedas--hardly one to\r\nthe square mile of all religions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KASHMIRI BOATMEN.]\r\n\r\nThe different creeds get on very comfortably side by side, the mosque\r\nand the idol temple decorating the same street, and the praying-machines\r\nof the Lamas grinding out perpetual bliss without let or hinderance from\r\nthose who believe in another way of reaching the ear of the Unknowable.\r\nThis Utopian scene of universal toleration has not failed to attract the\r\nrepresentatives of our own faith. The Moravians have long had an\r\nestablishment on the south-eastern mountains, and we read of the\r\nconversion of the descendants of the last rajah of Kishtwar by an\r\nAmerican missionary--of what sect is not stated.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the lines of race coincide but vaguely with those of\r\ncreed. The Hindus and Mohammedans are both of Aryan race, and Mohammedan\r\nconverts are found among the Mongolian--or rather Turanian--worshippers\r\nof Budh. The latter process would have made more headway but for the\r\ninfluence of the reigning dynasty, which discourages it on system. The\r\nchange implied in this proselytism is greater in respect of some social\r\npractices than in the abstract principles of religious belief. The\r\npolyandry of the Tibetans is in direct contrast with the polygamy of the\r\nMoslems, and is far more strictly maintained. It is favored by the\r\ncircumstance that, contrary to what usually obtains in old countries,\r\nthe males in this region considerably outnumber the females; yet, while\r\nthat disproportion exists throughout the provinces, polyandry is\r\nconfined to the Tibetans. Their wretched lands, verging on the line of\r\nperpetual snow, devoid of fuel, and in many places unable to ripen\r\ngrain, keep them poor; and they assign as a justification for the\r\npractice the necessity of repressing population and retaining property\r\nundivided. One mistress of the house and three or four masters, who are\r\nalmost always brothers, is their unique remedy for the hardships of\r\ntheir lot, so lowly and yet (topographically) so elevated. Among their\r\nMohammedan and Hindu compatriots the \"twin barbarism\" of a plurality of\r\nwives appears to be confined in practice to a few of the powerful and\r\nwealthy. Until within the last few years its repulsive features were\r\nwont to be brought into more hideous relief by the cruel custom of\r\nsuttee, or widow-burning. It is only within half a generation past that\r\nBritish interference has succeeded in putting a stop to these horrible\r\nimmolations. When, in 1843, Suchet Singh, uncle of the present\r\nmaharajah, Ranbir Singh, died, his _home_ harem of a hundred and fifty\r\nwives were burned with his body at Ramnagar, and the same execution was\r\ninflicted on his branch establishment of twenty-five at Jummoo. Seven\r\nyears after the beginning of British sway the thirty-two widows of a\r\ncousin of the maharajah were burned. This scene was witnessed by Mr.\r\nDrew, an English engineer of eminence who was for ten years employed in\r\nsurveying and exploring the new state, and from whose narrative many of\r\nthe facts given in this article are drawn. Upon another occasion he saw\r\nthe forcible sacrifice of a single widow. The poor woman, shrieking\r\nfearfully, sprang from the funeral pile as the flames surrounded her,\r\nbut was instantly seized and thrown back into it by the \"scandalized\"\r\npriests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KASHMIRIAN BRAHMANS.]\r\n\r\nThe guide-book and the locomotive have marked this romantic land for\r\ntheir own, but their progress is far from complete. The advance of the\r\nlatter, indeed, has probably reached its limit, some twenty leagues\r\noutside the extreme south-western corner. The former is still fain to\r\ndepend largely on Bernier, the Frenchman who visited Kashmir two\r\ncenturies ago in the train of the Mogul emperor Aurengzebe. Bernier kept\r\nhis eyes open, and left not only a good account of the manners and life\r\nof the Great Mogul and his court, but a fair itinerary. His description\r\nof Srinagar and its vicinity still holds good, and modern books point us\r\nto the pass of the Pir Panjal so disastrous to the imperial ladies. The\r\nforemost of fifteen elephants, each carrying four women, took fright in\r\na narrow part of the so-called road and backed the rest over a\r\nprecipice. Only three or four of the odalisques were killed by the fall,\r\nbut not one elephant was saved. Bernier passed the scene of the accident\r\ntwo days after, and saw some of the animals still alive, but able only\r\nto trumpet mournfully for assistance.\r\n\r\nNorth of Jummoo the highest type of road accommodates no longer an\r\nelephant, but at most a hill-pony. In the vale of Srinagar the chief\r\nthoroughfares are sluggish rivers, lakes and canals, navigated by a\r\nremarkably sturdy race of boatmen. The chief line of traffic to that\r\nvalley, the heart of Kashmir proper, from Jummoo, is hardly practicable\r\nfor horses. In its length of a hundred and seventy-seven miles it\r\ncrosses two ridges, each nine thousand feet above the sea, with a hollow\r\nbetween five thousand feet deep. The starting-point, or southern end of\r\nthe path, is fifteen hundred feet above tide, and the valley of Srinagar\r\nfrom fifty-two hundred to sixty-five hundred. These are all trifling\r\nelevations compared to those of the Himaliya on the south-east and the\r\nKarakoram chain, to which England has pushed the maharajah's boundary,\r\non the north; but they will do very well for Western tourists to \"cut\r\ntheir teeth on,\" especially as they are interspersed with minor hills of\r\nevery grade of height and surface. The varied assortment of climates\r\nalso supports the idea of a general training-ground for travellers.\r\nBernier thought the first summit he crossed, coming from the south, \"the\r\ndreadful rim of the world,\" but the descent of it plumped him, \"as if by\r\nenchantment, into the centre of France.\" In sheltered places with a\r\nsouthern exposure the tropics reappear, but the vegetation of the\r\nfoothills and middle mountains is said to be, but for the deodara cedar\r\n(_Pinus excelsa_) and a few other trees, European in character. The\r\nresemblance of the undergrowth is less marked, and still less that of\r\nthe inhabitants, the costume of the mountaineers, notably the tribe\r\nnamed Gaddis, reasserting Asia. These Oriental Swiss are as hardy as\r\ntheir Western analogues, thanks to a continual struggle for existence\r\nagainst Nature and a tolerably frequent one against man. Against the\r\nlatter foe they are at present guaranteed by the quiet of English rule,\r\nbut the avalanche and the torrent remain unquelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOGRAS AND MUSSULMANS, JUMMOO.]\r\n\r\nThe famous vale is an emerald with a rough setting--a jewel always much\r\nsought after, and which would have been carried away long ago had it\r\nbeen portable. But its mightiest and most fortunate possessors were fain\r\nto come to it by a long and painful path over crags and snows, and to\r\npass away, one after the other, and leave it in undimmed brightness,\r\nclasped tightly as ever in its frame of rocks. At the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century its ruler was a Hindu rani, who stabbed herself\r\nrather than marry her traitorous and usurping vizier. Then came the\r\nsway of a Moslem dynasty, two of whose members stand out prominently by\r\nreason of opposite traits. One earned the name of the Image-breaker by\r\nhis wanton destruction of the ancient architecture and sculpture. The\r\nbalance oscillated toward the good when, in the fifteenth century,\r\nZein-ul-Abdin introduced the Tibetan goat and the weavers of Turkestan,\r\nand originated the manufacture of the famous shawls. In 1588 the country\r\nwas surrendered to the emperor Akbar, who, with the most noted of his\r\ndescendants, Jehangir, Shah Jehan and Aurengzebe, made it their favorite\r\nsummer-retreat and lavished upon it an expenditure the fruits of which\r\nare yet conspicuous. The Afghans, from beyond the north-west mountains,\r\nseized it in 1752, and were dispossessed by Ranjit Singh in 1819, who\r\nthus restored the supremacy of the ancient religion after more than four\r\ncenturies of Moslem rule. The repose now enjoyed by it under the almost\r\nentirely unseen but distinctly felt influence of the English promises to\r\nreproduce something like the palmy days of the Moguls in the matter of\r\nimprovement and embellishment, with a security to life and property\r\nunder fixed and just laws quite unknown in their time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORT AT GILGIT.]\r\n\r\nA visitor familiar with all the scenic features of the happy valley\r\nwould almost have us believe that artificial decoration has exhausted\r\nitself, and that the art now in demand is simply the art of letting\r\nNature and antiquity alone:\r\n\r\n\"The valley of Kashmir, properly so called, remains, as in the\r\nseventeenth century, the largest and the most beautiful bit of\r\nlandscape-gardening in the world, a park thirty leagues by ten or\r\ntwelve. Everything in it seems planned with supernatural ingenuity to\r\ndelight the eye--fields, orchards, dwellings, rivers and lakes sprinkled\r\nwith green and flowery islets and ploughed by boats of varied form and\r\nsize navigated by _hanjis_ (boatmen) whose intelligent countenances,\r\nsculpturesque figures and graceful costumes harmonize admirably with the\r\nenchanting scenery; innumerable brooks and canals curving capriciously\r\namong lawns and rice-meadows and glittering in the sun like ribbons shot\r\nwith silver.\"\r\n\r\nThis portrait leaves out the temples and villas, ancient and modern, the\r\nterraces and pavilions edged with the lotus and overhung with vines and\r\nplane trees, the Shalmiar Bagh, or Garden of Delight, and the Mishat\r\nBagh, or Garden of Pleasure, where wine-loving Jehangir and his\r\nbeautiful consort Nur Jahan, the Light of the World, luxuriated in the\r\nsummers of long ago. This potentate declared that he would rather lose\r\nall the rest of his vast and affluent empire than Kashmir. It furnished\r\na place of refreshing retreat for his energies and his conscience, the\r\nload of the latter being fully up to the average of an Eastern\r\ndespot's. By these lulling waters and under this embowering verdure he\r\ncould shut out from the sight and memory such spectacles as that to\r\nwhich he had treated his rebellious son Khosrou--a long row of seven\r\nhundred of the latter's accomplices seated in solemn gravity, but not\r\nreturning his salute as he was led along, for the sufficient if not\r\nimmediately perceptible reason that they sat upon thorns, each upon one\r\nthorn a foot or so long, of iron. We may suppose the father of Frederick\r\nthe Great to have had in mind this passage of Oriental life when he\r\nforced the prince to witness the execution of his young friend Katte.\r\n\r\nWilson's preference is for the Garden of Pleasure, notwithstanding the\r\nelegance of that of Delight. It looks out upon Lake Dal, the Golden\r\nIsland in front:\r\n\r\n\"Ten terraces, bounded by magnificent trees and with a stream of water\r\nfalling over them, lead up to the latticed pavilion at the end of this\r\ngarden. Between the double stories of this pavilion the stream flows\r\nthrough a marble--or at least a limestone--tank, and the structure is\r\nshaded by great _chunar_ trees, while through a vista of their splendid\r\nfoliage we look down the terraces and water-courses upon the lake\r\nbelow.\"\r\n\r\nA fit dreaming-place this for the lotus-eating monarch of a lotus-eating\r\npeople. The lake is so full of the lotus and other water-lilies that\r\nmore than sixty thousand tons of the edible nuts are gathered each year\r\nand ground into flour, the root besides serving as a popular esculent.\r\nWhat is an object of devotion with the Tibetans of the higher Himaliyas\r\na few days' journey distant, as formerly with the Egyptians, is to the\r\nKashmiris an article of food and trade. They might draw from the waters,\r\nwhich cover a very small part of the fertile valley, fish enough to\r\nsupport, with the nelumbium nuts, nearly the whole of the present\r\npopulation; but then they are lotus-eaters, and as such improvident and\r\nindolent by all rules of poetry and legend.\r\n\r\nSrinagar has been likened to Venice. Standing a mile higher in the\r\nworld, water-communication is its dependence for movement of persons and\r\nthings almost as exclusively as with the Queen of the Adriatic. For\r\nonce, the lean, dry Oriental has his fill of water. Moisture prevails in\r\nexcess. The characteristic flat roof of his house gives place to one\r\nwith slope enough to shed any shower or number of showers; and that soon\r\nbecomes clad with a spontaneous growth of plants. The surplus rainfall,\r\nhowever, is not so great as it would be were not the stormy south-west\r\nmonsoons cut off by the mountains. The English, water-dogs by nature,\r\nand last from the blazing plains of the Panjab, do not complain of\r\ndampness. One of them, indeed, declares that \"the air is exceedingly\r\ndry, notwithstanding the immense amount of water in the valley and the\r\nfrequent showers of rain.\"\r\n\r\nSrinagar--as the city known for four centuries as Kashmir was anciently\r\nand is again named under Hindu rule--is a little disappointing in the\r\nmaterial employed for most of its structures. Stone is not wanting, but\r\nthe deodar timber is more abundant, being floated down cheaply from the\r\nmountains, where it forms immense forests, the carefully preserved\r\nhunting-ground of the Mogul emperors. A Frenchman dubs it a city of\r\nchalets, and recommends the architects of Paris to seek there the most\r\ncharming models for kiosks, verandas, turrets, cupolas, etc. The\r\nhumblest suburban and rural abodes he pronounces full of the\r\npicturesque. They appear to be much in the Swiss style, so natural to an\r\nalpine region. They, too, are mostly of wood, except on the high slopes,\r\nwhere that material is scarce or wholly absent, and on the frontiers,\r\nwhere each hut is a little rock-fort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEN OF DARDISTAN.]\r\n\r\nEven the piers of the bridges over the Jhelam are, above the water at\r\nleast, formed of large logs, which overlap each other and approach with\r\ntheir ends the middle of each span after the semblance of an arch.\r\nParasitic plants, and even considerable trees, take root in their\r\ncrevices and disguise the structure in an even more bizarre way than the\r\nmediaeval buildings did Old London Bridge. There are seven of these\r\nbridges within the city, about three hundred feet long, and between them\r\non either hand the houses overhang the water at the expense of all\r\nvisible shore, sometimes striding out upon stilt-like piles, their\r\nmultiform gables \"fantastically set\" with a total disregard of\r\nuniformity and extent of facade that would have been the death of Baron\r\nHaussmann or the builder of a Philadelphia block. Nevertheless, there is\r\na pervading tone and style which would identify a Kashmiri villa\r\ntransplanted into Christendom.\r\n\r\nTwo isolated hills overlooking the city, and visible afar off to the\r\nweary wayfarer, are crowned and flanked with fortifications and temples\r\nof one or the other religion. The list of the latter edifices included,\r\nin Bernier's time, a Hindu pagoda claimed by the inhabitants to have\r\nbeen built by Solomon, but it has now disappeared as completely as his\r\nbetter-authenticated effort at Jerusalem. In return, as compensation, a\r\nMohammedan mosque has given place to a modern fort. The march of\r\nimprovement or of change shows itself in a yet more modern array of\r\ncottages erected for the accommodation of English visitors. Here these\r\ngentry hide themselves in an absolute forest of fruit trees of the kinds\r\nfamiliar at home--apple, apricot, cherry, etc. The lovers of the apricot\r\nmay be interested to learn that it is _par excellence_ the fruit of this\r\nsoi-disant Eden, this glittering attic-window upon the Roof of the\r\nWorld, and of all the slopes thereof up to the white-tiled roof-tree. It\r\nflourishes up to ten thousand feet, only the stone-pine, of all edibles,\r\ngoing higher; and dried apricots are a leading staple among the hillmen,\r\nas dates are with the Arabs.\r\n\r\nUpon the bazaars the English architect has laid his heavy hand, and\r\nvillas and shops like those of the Thames promise to mark the artistic\r\nrenaissance of Kashmir. The pleasure-houses of the emperors before\r\nmentioned have so far escaped him, although it is to be feared he will\r\nsoon have the repairing of them. Their principal charms, the turf, the\r\ngreat trees and the cascades, were never more beautiful, and have rather\r\ngained by the softness with which age has enriched them. The trees have\r\nbeen steadily growing under all flags and cults, swelling in pride and\r\nstrength as they looked contemptuously and calmly down on the storms of\r\nhuman passion. They need no repairs, and their style, nobody knows how\r\nmuch older than Thebes or Dendera, will endure no modification.\r\n\r\nThe level surface of this alluvion is illustrated by the very slight\r\ndescent of the Jhelam. From Ismailabad, near the head of the valley, and\r\nfifty-four hundred feet above the level of the sea, the fall to\r\nSrinagar, thirty miles, is seventy-five feet; and from the capital to\r\nLake Wular, twenty-four miles below, only fifty-five feet--declivities\r\nin marked contrast with the fall of two thousand eight hundred feet in\r\neighty miles from the edge of the plateau at Baramula to the plain of\r\nthe Panjab. Besides the ancient beaches which indicate the origin of\r\nthis upland meadow, there are traceable other and more recent evidences\r\nof a change of level in the waters, pointing to an elevation, as the\r\nformer do to subsidence. In the Manas-Bal, the smallest but deepest of\r\nthe Kashmirian lakes, submerged ruins, alleged to be those of a temple,\r\nare clearly visible. At another point, fifteen miles below Srinagar,\r\nruins and fragments of pottery have been exhumed at a great depth. One\r\nof these oscillations appears to be now, or to have been within two\r\ncenturies, in progress. Lake Wular has grown shallower, its present\r\naverage depth being forty feet.\r\n\r\nMan, among these enormous mountains, presents not less notably than\r\ninanimate Nature a singular compound of change and solidity, of the\r\ncatastrophic and the secular. The little state of Kashmir, overrun from\r\ntime immemorial, in peace or war, by hordes of many races and tongues,\r\npreserves a language and a physiognomy of its own. About forty per cent.\r\nof the words in Kashmiri are Persian, twenty-five Sanscrit, fifteen\r\nHindusthani, ten Arabic and fifteen Mongol. Its letters resemble those\r\nof the Sanscrit, and are apparently the originals of the Tibetan\r\ncharacters. They are not much used, the literary capabilities of the\r\nKashmiris remaining to be developed. Travellers say the men, especially\r\nthe upper classes who have maintained the purity of their blood, are the\r\nfinest, physically, to be found in the Himaliya. They are stout,\r\nwell-built, and pleasing in countenance, resembling Europeans, except in\r\nhaving a darker complexion. They are more acute and intelligent than the\r\nSikhs and than the Dogras or Hindus of Jummoo, their present superiors\r\npolitically. They are industrious, manufacturing besides shawls other\r\nstuffs and much fancy-work in wood. The beauty of the women is as much\r\nremarked upon now as in the old days, and the late Mr. Moore cannot be\r\naccused of overstepping poetic license on that point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKARDU FORT, BALTISTAN.]\r\n\r\nThe higher classes of the Kashmiris having held more firmly to their\r\nreligion during Mohammedan sway, most of the non-Moslem inhabitants are\r\nBrahmans, and they live chiefly in the city. Unlike their\r\nco-religionists of the province of Jummoo, many of whose high-caste men\r\ncultivate the soil, the Kashmiri Brahmans contemn manual occupations.\r\nThey are largely employed in the offices of the state. The lowest\r\noccupations are left to a class of pariahs called Batals, who are\r\nconsidered by some to represent a wholly distinct race, a remnant of the\r\naborigines who were dispossessed by the first Aryan settlers. As it is\r\neasier to procure photographs of individuals belonging to this degraded\r\nclass than of those above them, an unjust impression of the physical\r\ntraits of the Kashmiris is apt to reach the Western World. The\r\ndancing-girls are Batals, and are pronounced by those who know very\r\nunfavorable specimens of the Kashmiri fair. The Mohammedan women are\r\nalways veiled.\r\n\r\nBut ethnic science, whether based on linguistic, physical, social or\r\nreligious distinctions, is in a very unsatisfactory condition.\r\nSurprising yet illusory resemblances are constantly cropping up in the\r\nmost unexpected ways and places. Wilson was struck with the Gaelic\r\ntraits of the Mongolian Budhists who inhabit the mountains of Zanskar,\r\nsouth-east of the valley. \"The sound of their language, the brooches\r\nwhich fasten their plaids, the varieties of tartan which their woollen\r\nclothes present, and even the features of the people (which are of an\r\nAryan rather than a Tartar type), strongly reminded me of the Scotch\r\nHighlanders.\" He had the support, too, of one of those imaginative\r\nsavants who delight in Welsh, Erse and Gaelic philology, who insisted\r\n\"that the names of innumerable places in Tibet and Tartary are identical\r\nwith the local names of the Gaelic language.\" Add to this the fact that\r\na corps of the maharajah's army is uniformed in an almost critically\r\nexact reproduction of \"the garb of old Gaul,\" and the argument is a good\r\ndeal more complete than many on more practically momentous points which\r\nhave done service for centuries and are still accepted. We have the\r\nGauls of Galatia, Galatz, Galicia, Gallia proper and Gaeldoch (or\r\nCaledonia), forming a continuous chain of Gallic settlements from the\r\nHimaliya to the Ultima Thule. And now the circuit is complete. The\r\ncurrent sets back from the West. The slogan, heard so tellingly at\r\nLucknow, is swelling up the glaciers of the Asiatic fatherland to save\r\nit from the Scythians! Monkbarns lived too soon.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans of Baltistan, on the opposite (or northern) side of\r\nKashmir, again surprise us by speaking a Tartar tongue. We are not told\r\nthat they are Scotch, endowed though they undoubtedly are with some of\r\nthe canny and thrifty characteristics of the dwellers ayont the Tweed.\r\nThey are inveterate tradesmen, and carry their small wares, including\r\nhill-ponies, all through the mountains. Let us drop in upon them, if\r\nsuch an expression be applicable to a climb of the most tremendous\r\ndescription. It takes us up the steps of the steepest and loftiest slope\r\nof the amphitheatre which forms the maharajah's dominions. First,\r\nhowever, we begin by a gentle and pleasant descent down the Jhelam to\r\nLake Wular. Then begins the trouble. We turn northward, and find\r\nourselves at the end of the first stage four thousand feet above the\r\nvalley, on the brink of an artificial sheet of water surrounded by dense\r\nevergreen woods. Next day we rise 2000 feet higher, and redescend 6500\r\nfeet to the banks of the Kischanganga, the chief affluent of the Jhelam,\r\nrunning mostly parallel to the course of the latter stream. Then we\r\nundulate--if so soft a term be applicable to a route so sharply,\r\nabruptly and irregularly serrate--along the spurs which border the\r\nriver, now in the forest and now on a bleak plateau where careful\r\nirrigation avails to grow nothing less hardy than millet, peas and\r\nbuckwheat. In crossing to the valley, or rather trench, of the upper\r\nIndus, we have the choice of two passes, one 13,060 and the other 13,500\r\nfeet above tide. Having selected the least of these two evils, we swoop\r\nnearly six thousand feet down upon the village of Astor and a new\r\nlanguage, the Dard. The temptation to stop and study either is small. If\r\nwe are insatiate of climbing or find the heat at Astor--only 7853 feet\r\nabove the sea--oppressive, we have the ice-cone of Nanga Parbat, 26,629\r\nfeet high, within ten miles to the west. We are within unpleasantly easy\r\nreach of the western and north-western frontier now; for the opposite\r\nslope of Nanga Parbat and the ridge to which it belongs is held by the\r\nindependent Mohammedan tribes of Yaghistan, born marauders since the\r\nbeginning of tradition. They have a republican form of government, one\r\nof the fierce democracies numbering only seven houses. Life, liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of other people's property is a motto they act up to with a\r\npersistency and consistency highly disagreeable to their neighbors over\r\nthe hill. The latter have, in self-defence, evinced a tendency to adopt\r\nthe same rule of action, and to steal from their friends by way of\r\nreimbursement for what is stolen by their enemies--a disposition which\r\nis discouraged by the maintenance of a considerable garrison at Astor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KAGANI, OR LAMA MONUMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe valley of Gilgit, continuous with that of Astor, inasmuch as the two\r\nabut upon the Indus at nearly the same point, one falling and the other\r\nrising, is the core of a tongue of territory projecting north-west into\r\nthe heart of Yaghistan, and nearly dividing that turbulent region into\r\ntwo parts. The British in attaching this corner to Kashmir rather\r\nstrained established boundaries in their own favor, and will doubtless\r\ncontinue the process till all Yaghistan is absorbed and the great\r\nKarakoram range becomes the frontier from the Afghan territory to that\r\nof Chinese Tibet.\r\n\r\nAt the town of Gilgit we have a reproduction in little of the valley of\r\nSrinagar. Its level is somewhat lower, and, though farther north by two\r\ndegrees, it ripens such southern fruits as the pomegranate, etc. Its\r\nattractions will not, however, have full sway so long as the peace of\r\nthe region remains precarious. The last attack from Yaghistan was\r\nsignally repulsed in 1866. The practice of going armed is still general,\r\nand travellers need an escort. Some of the villages resemble the\r\ncasemates, mines and covered-ways of a fortress. The people are of the\r\nsame family and religion with those over the border, their foes,\r\nalthough perhaps less hated by them than their nominal compatriots the\r\nKashmiris and Dogras. The Dards are an active and proud people, fond of\r\nindependence, with features distinctly Caucasian.\r\n\r\nContinuing our exploration of the upper benches of the amphitheatre, we\r\nturn to the right and skirt the upper Indus, which runs for several\r\nhundred miles from south-east to north-west close along the southern\r\nfoot of the Karakoram, or rather upon a \"hip\" of the Roof of the World.\r\nSkardu, on the left bank, was an independent capital down to 1840, and\r\nits aspect is still stormy in a political as in a climatic sense. The\r\nland looks like a petrified storm, the waves of granite and slate dotted\r\nsporadically with huts and microscopic bits of culture. Only in a few of\r\nthe deep valleys is Nature less inhospitable. The glaciers descend to an\r\naltitude of 13,500 feet, with an upward extent of twenty-five miles or\r\nmore; cultivation, after a fashion, existing at their lower edge, and\r\ngrass growing for a season of six or eight weeks much farther up. The\r\nBaltoro glacier leads up to a stupendous peak, the second in height of\r\nall known elevations, but not yet dignified with a name, being only\r\nlabelled in the Indian Survey \"K. 2.\" Its height is 28,265 feet, or 687\r\nless than Gaurisankar, the giant of mountains, a peak in the Eastern\r\nHimaliya. The summits next to K.2 are from 25,000 to 27,000 feet. Among\r\nthem lies the pass of Mustagh, 18,300 feet above tide, up to 1863 a\r\nhigh-road between India and Yarkand, practicable for but a few weeks of\r\nsummer. The brief interval left by the snow the brigands have\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nAfter the abandonment of this pass, that of Karakoram, forty leagues\r\neast of it, became the principal route to Central Asia. The elevation is\r\nexactly the same. Of the five hundred and fifteen miles, divided into\r\nthirty-five marches, between Leh and Yarkand, a hundred and fifty\r\ntraverse ice, naked rocks and precipices, wholly devoid of grass or\r\nfuel. Still farther east, in the extreme north-eastern angle of Ladakh\r\nand the Kashmiri states, a third route to Turkestan has been opened. It\r\nis longer than the others, but is practicable for near half the year,\r\nand can be traversed by horses and two-humped camels instead of yaks and\r\nponies, as at the western crossings. On three stages only are wood and\r\ngrass absent. It ascends from the south over a plateau marked by salt or\r\nbrackish lakes. It is difficult to say which of the three contestant\r\nempires, Russia, China and England, has easiest or least impracticable\r\naccess to the coveted core of Asia.\r\n\r\nIf the handful of Little Tibetans occupy the gallery of the Kashmiri\r\ntheatre, there are wells in it which go down to the level of the\r\ndress-circle. These lower levels have traits of culture--trees, grass,\r\nwhitewashed brick or stone dwellings, and nunneries and religious\r\nmonuments on the roadside and sometimes arching the road. All, high and\r\nlow in rank and topography, are deeply pious, and devote the greater\r\npart of their waking hours to muttering a supplicatory formula of six\r\nsyllables, so far translatable by Christians only to the extent of its\r\nmeaning something about the Deity and the lotus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCK STATUE OF BUDH, LADAKH.]\r\n\r\nThe trip from New York to Jummoo is about as long in point of time as to\r\nCalifornia twenty-five years ago. As many years hence the survivors of\r\nus may be getting up Thanksgiving or Christmas reunions at the old\r\nhomestead of the Aryan family. It will never be a hackneyed spot. It\r\nstands too much on end. Steep mountains are never hackneyed: Cook's\r\nPersonally Conducted will never permeate Kashmir.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD C. BRUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FOR PERCIVAL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nSHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nIt was the first of March, and a wild wind was hurrying fragments of\r\nwhite cloud across the blue. Percival had taken his breakfast in\r\nsnatches, performing on his bell meanwhile. Emma had not brought his\r\nboots, and would not so much as come to be told that he wanted them. At\r\nlast, despairing, he went out on the landing and shouted his request to\r\nher as she shuffled on some errand below. Turning to go back, he met\r\nMiss Lisle, who had just come down the stairs behind him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey stood for a moment exchanging trivial remarks. To them came a\r\nstout, fresh-colored, peculiarly innocent-looking old man, who went by\r\nwith a beaming smile and a slight bow.\r\n\r\n\"That's Mr. Fordham,\" said Judith: \"I don't think I ever saw him so\r\nclose before.\"\r\n\r\n\"No: one hardly meets him from one week's end to another. He is\r\nunusually late this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"He _looks_ a very quiet, steady--Really, one might take him for rather\r\na nice old man.\"\r\n\r\nPercival stared blankly at her, and then began to laugh: \"Well, Miss\r\nLisle, I never heard a reputation blighted so completely by a\r\ncomplimentary sentence before.\"\r\n\r\nJudith blushed a little: \"But he isn't very nice, is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about _nice_. I should say he was as steady and harmless\r\nan old fellow as ever lived. What _do_ you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Judith hesitated, \"of course one has no business to judge any\r\none without really knowing; but his staying out so late at night--\"\r\n\r\n\"'So late at night?'\" Percival repeated.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he has a latch-key generally. But one or two nights I am sure\r\nMiss Bryant sat up to let him in. I heard them whispering: at least, I\r\nheard her. I don't think that girl could even whisper quietly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there must be some mistake. Fordham comes in quite early, and very\r\noften he doesn't go out at all in the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"He goes out later,\" said Judith.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, no. I could time all his movements. His room is next to mine,\r\nand the wall is not so thick as I could wish. He snores sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" she persisted, looking scared and white, yet what was Fordham to\r\nher?--\"but I have heard him over and over again, Mr. Thorne. I can't be\r\nmistaken.\"\r\n\r\nPercival was disconcerted too. He looked at the carpet, at his slippered\r\nfeet--at anything but her face: \"You have heard some one, I suppose: I\r\ndon't know who comes in late. Not poor old Fordham.\" He heard Emma on\r\nthe stairs, and hurried to meet her. Coming back with his boots in his\r\nhand, he found Judith standing exactly as he had left her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I beg Mr. Fordham's pardon,\" she said with a smile. \"One does\r\nmake curious mistakes, certainly. That nice-looking old man!\" And\r\nnodding farewell to young Thorne, she went away.\r\n\r\nHe did not see her again for two days, though he watched anxiously for\r\nher. Bertie came in and out, and was much as usual. On the third\r\nevening, as Percival was going up stairs, she called after him: \"Mr.\r\nThorne.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"You lent Bertie some money a day or two since?\"\r\n\r\nSomething in her voice or her look made Percival sure that Lisle had\r\nborrowed and spent it without her knowledge, and that it was a trouble\r\nto her. After all, what did it matter? He would sell his watch and pay\r\nMrs. Bryant. He could not deny Bertie's debt, since she had found it\r\nout, but he could make light of it. So he nodded: \"Yes, by the the way,\r\nI believe I did: he hadn't his purse or something.\" This in a tone of\r\nairy indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me how much it was, please, and I'll pay it back.\" Then he saw\r\nthat her purse was open in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it doesn't matter,\" Percival said: \"don't pay me off in such a\r\nquick, business-like way, Miss Lisle. I'm not the milkman, nor yet the\r\nwashing. Bertie will settle with me one of these days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please tell me, Mr. Thorne. I mean to pay it: I must.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll ask him about it, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ know,\" with a look of reproach and pleading.\r\n\r\nPercival could not deceive her, she looked so sorrowfully resolute. He\r\nmet the glance of her gray eyes. \"Two pounds,\" he said; and was certain\r\nthat she was relieved at the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Bertie wasn't sure it wasn't two pounds ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my honor, no. He asked me for a couple of sovereigns, and I took it\r\nliterally.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you say so, I am sure. I didn't doubt you: I only told you that you\r\nmight understand why I asked.\" She put the money, a sovereign and two\r\nhalves, into his unwilling hand. Then he understood her relief, for,\r\nlooking down into the little sealskin purse, he saw that there was no\r\nmore gold in it. The last ten shillings must have been counted out in\r\nsilver, and he was not quite sure it would not have ended in a\r\nthreepenny piece and some halfpence.\r\n\r\n\"Now I am going to ask a favor,\" she said. \"Don't lend Bertie any more,\r\nplease. He has been used to spend just what he liked, and he doesn't\r\nthink, poor boy! And it is only wasted. Don't let him have any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Miss Lisle,\" said Percival, \"if your brother asks me do you mean\r\nthat I am to say 'No'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, if you would. He mustn't be extravagant: we can't afford it. He\r\ncan't pay you back, and if I lost any of my work--Mrs. Barton's lessons,\r\nfor instance--I couldn't either.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ work to pay _me_!\" exclaimed Percival aghast: \"I won't hear of\r\nsuch a thing. Miss Lisle, you mustn't! It's between Bertie and myself,\r\nand I shouldn't be ruined if he didn't pay me till his ship comes home\r\none of these days. Take it back, please, and he and I will arrange it.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head: \"No: my brother's debts are mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Percival, with a swift, eloquent glance. \"Then let me be your\r\ncreditor a little longer: I hardly know what it feels like, yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since when has _your_ ship come home, Mr. Thorne, that you can afford\r\nto be so generous?\"\r\n\r\nThe blood mounted to his forehead at her question, but he answered\r\nquickly: \"My ship has not come home. Perhaps if it had I should not dare\r\nto ask you to let me help you. I feel as if our poverty made us all\r\nnearer together.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not every one who would say so in your place,\" Judith replied. \"I\r\n_am_ your debtor for those words. But we Lisles have wronged you too\r\nmuch already: you shouldn't try to make the load heavier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wronged me?\" he faltered.\r\n\r\n\"Did you think I did not know? My father had your money and ruined you:\r\ndeny it if you can! I suspected it, and lately I have been sure. Oh, if\r\nBertie and I could pay you back! But meanwhile he shall not borrow from\r\nyou and waste your earnings on his silly whims. If you lend him any more\r\nyou may try to hide it from me, but I shall find it out, and I will pay\r\nit--every farthing. I will find some way, if I have to sit up every\r\nnight for a week and work my fingers to the bone.\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid!\" said Percival. \"He shall have no more from me. But be\r\ngenerous, and promise me that if you _should_ want help, such as my\r\npoverty can give, you will forget old times and come to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't promise that. I will remember them and come.\" She caught\r\nhis hand, pressed it one moment in her own, flung it from her and\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n\"Judith!\" he called after her, but she was gone.\r\n\r\nPercival went into his own room. The money had come just in time, for\r\nhis landlady's weekly account was lying on the table. He looked at the\r\nthree coins with lingering tenderness, and after a moment's hesitation\r\nhe took one of them and vowed that he would never part with it. Yet in\r\nthe midst of his ardent resolution he smiled rather bitterly to think\r\nthat it was not the sovereign, but one of the halves, he meant to keep\r\nfor ever. Poverty had taught him many lessons, and among them how to\r\ncombine economy and sentiment. \"If she had given me the ten shillings'\r\nworth of silver, I suppose I should have saved the threepenny bit!\" he\r\nsaid to himself as he locked his little remembrance in his desk.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later, as he was walking home with Bertie, they passed\r\nthree or four men who were sauntering idly along, and Thorne felt sure\r\nthat his companion received and returned a silent glance of recognition.\r\nHe glanced over his shoulder at them, and disliked their look\r\nexceedingly. \"Do you know who those fellows were we passed just now?\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBertie looked back: \"One is the brother of a man in our choir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm! I wouldn't have one of them for my brother at any price,\" said\r\nPercival. The matter dropped, but he could not forget it. He fancied\r\nthat there was a slight change in Bertie himself--that the boy's face\r\nwas keener and haggard, and there was an anxious expression in his eyes.\r\nBut he owned frankly that he was not at all sure that he should have\r\nnoticed anything if his suspicions had not been previously aroused.\r\n\r\n\"Come in this evening,\" said Bertie when they went up stairs. He leant\r\nagainst the door of Percival's room, and as his friend hesitated he\r\ncalled to his sister: \"Here, Judith! tell Thorne to come and have some\r\ntea with us: they've let his fire out, and his room is as warm and\r\ncheerful as a sepulchre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I order other people about as I do you?\" she\r\nreplied.--\"Will you come, Mr. Thorne? I can, at any rate, promise you a\r\nfire and a welcome.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she met him she was quite calm, tranquil and clear-eyed. Do the\r\nripples of the summer sea recall that distant line, the supreme effort\r\nof wind and tide some stormy night? Percival would have thought that it\r\nhad been all a dream but for the little coin which that wave had flung\r\nat his feet for a remembrance. And he had called after her \"Judith!\" The\r\ntide had ebbed, and he did not even think of her as other than Miss\r\nLisle. Had she heard him that evening? He would almost have hoped not,\r\nbut that twilight moment seemed so far away that it must be absurd to\r\nlink it with his every-day life.\r\n\r\nApparently, she and Bertie were on their usual footing. Did the young\r\nfellow know of that absurd mistake about old Fordham? Did Percival\r\nreally detect a shade of dim apprehension on Judith Lisle's face, as if\r\nshe hid an unspoken fear? As Bertie leant forward and the lamplight\r\nshone on his clearly-cut features, Percival was more than ever certain\r\nof the change in him. Could his sister fail to see it?\r\n\r\n\"Bertie,\" she said when they had finished their tea and were standing\r\nround the fire--\"Bertie, I'm afraid you have lost one of your pupils.\"\r\n\r\nHe had his elbow on the chimney-piece, his hand hung loosely open, and\r\nhis eyes were fixed upon the leaping flames. When Judith spoke he looked\r\nup inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Nash--Emmeline Nash,\" said Judith.\r\n\r\nPercival happened to be looking at the fire too, and he suddenly saw\r\nBertie's fingers drawn quickly up. But the young master spoke very\r\ncomposedly indeed: \"Emmeline Nash--why? Has anything happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: only Mr. Nash has given in at last, and says she may go home at\r\nEaster for good.--She is older than any of the other pupils, Mr. Thorne:\r\nin fact, she is not treated as a pupil. But her father is--\"\r\n\r\n\"An old fossil,\" said Bertie.\r\n\r\n\"Well!--interested in fossils and that sort of thing, and a widower; so\r\nthere has not been much of a home for her, and he always fancied she was\r\nbetter at school. But school can't last for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happiest time of one's life!\" Bertie ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do you think so?\" said Judith doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. But I believe it is the right thing to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stupid boy!--And as she will very soon be twenty, I really think she\r\nought not to be kept there any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course Miss Nash is delighted,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but hardly as much so as I expected. One's castles in the air\r\ndon't look quite the same when one is close to them. I am afraid, her\r\nhome-life won't be very bright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she will make it brighter,\" said Thorne. \"What is she like? Is\r\nshe pretty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Bertie.\r\n\r\nJudith smiled: \"One has to qualify all one's adjectives for her. She is\r\nnice-ish, pretty-ish: I doubt if she is as much as clever-ish.\"\r\n\r\n\"No need for her to be any more,\" Bertie remarked. \"Didn't Miss Crawford\r\nsay she would come in for a lot of money--some of her mother's--when she\r\nwas one-and-twenty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, five or six hundred a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why he has kept her at school, I suppose--afraid she should take\r\nup with a curate, very likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Nash is very rich too, and she is an only child,\" said Judith,\r\nignoring Bertie's remark. \"But I think it has been hard on Emmeline.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry she is going,\" said Lisle--\"_very_ sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she such a promising pupil?\" Thorne inquired.\r\n\r\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Bertie, \"but a promising pupil--O Lord!\" He\r\nflew to the piano, played an air in a singularly wooden manner, and then\r\ndragged it languidly, yet laboriously, up and down the keys.\r\n\"Variations, you perceive.\" After a little more of this treatment the\r\nunfortunate melody grew very lame indeed, and finally died of\r\nexhaustion. \"That's Miss Emmeline Nash,\" said Bertie, spinning round on\r\nthe music-stool and confronting Percival.\r\n\r\n\"It is very like Emmeline's style of playing,\" Judith owned.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is. Let's have something else for a change.\" And turning\r\nback to the piano, he began to sing. Then he called Judith to come and\r\ntake her turn. She sang well, and Percival, by the fireside, noted the\r\nyoung fellow's evident pride in her performance, and admired the pair.\r\n(Any one else might have admired the three, for Thorne's grave,\r\nforeign-looking face was just the fitting contrast to the Lisles' fair,\r\nclear features. The morbid depression of a couple of months earlier had\r\npassed, and left him far more like the Percival of Brackenhill. Poverty\r\nsurrounded the friends and dulled their lives, but as yet it was only a\r\nburden, not a blight.)\r\n\r\n\"You sing,\" said Bertie, looking back. \"I remember you were great at\r\nsome of those old songs. I'll play for you: what shall it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I hardly know,\" said Percival, coming forward.\r\n\r\n\"Let's have 'Shall I, wasting in despair,'\" Lisle suggested. \"It has\r\nbeen going in my head all this morning.\" He played a few notes.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" the other exclaimed hurriedly--\"not that.\" Too well he\r\nremembered the tender devotion of more than a year before:\r\n\r\n    If she love me, this believe,\r\n    I will die ere she shall grieve.\r\n\r\nSissy and Brackenhill rose before him--the melancholy orchard-walk, the\r\nlittle hands which lay in his on that November day. He felt a dull pain,\r\nyet what could he do? what could he have done? There was a terrible\r\nmistake somewhere, but he could not say where. If he had married Sissy,\r\nwould it not have been there? He woke up suddenly. Young Lisle was\r\nspeaking, and Judith was saying, \"Let Mr. Thorne choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" said Percival. \"Shall it be 'Drink to me only with\r\nthine eyes'?\"\r\n\r\nHe sang it well. His voice was strong and full, and the sweet\r\nold-fashioned courtesy of compliment suited him exactly. The last word\r\nhad scarcely left his lips when the door opened, and Emma showed in Mr.\r\nClifton of St. Sylvester's.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman came forward, black-coated, smooth-shaven, with watchful\r\nglances which seemed ever looking out for that lay co-operation we hear\r\nso much of now. Lisle looked over his shoulder and sprang up to receive\r\nhim. The visitor tried to get his umbrella and two or three books into\r\nthe hand which already held his hat, and one little volume fell to the\r\nfloor. Percival picked it up and smoothed the pages. \"Mr. Thorne--Mr.\r\nClifton,\" said the young organist as the book was restored to its owner.\r\nPercival bowed gravely, and Mr. Clifton did not shake hands, as he would\r\nhave done if the young man's manner had been less reserved. He was\r\nlavish of such greetings. A clergyman might shake hands with any one.\r\n\r\n\"I'll not detain you long, Lisle,\" he said. \"But I wanted to speak to\r\nyou about the choir-practice to-morrow.\" And there ensued a little\r\nbusiness-talk between parson and organist. Judith took up a bit of work\r\nand Percival leant against the chimney-piece. Presently Lisle went back\r\nto the piano and tried over a hymn-tune which Mr. Clifton had brought.\r\nThe clergyman stood solemnly by. \"I met Gordon a few minutes ago,\" he\r\nsaid. \"He was with his brother and some other men of the same stamp. If\r\nhe mixes himself up with that set, he must go.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll miss him in the choir, Mr. Clifton,\" said Bertie.\r\n\r\n\"He must choose between such associates and the choir,\" the other\r\nreplied. The words were moderate enough, but the tone was austere.\r\n\r\n\"Especially at Easter,\" said Bertie, still playing.\r\n\r\n\"What of that?\" demanded the other. \"I would rather have no choir at St.\r\nSylvester's than have men in it whose way of life during the week made a\r\nmockery of the praises they sang on Sundays.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a low voice, and Bertie's playing partially covered the\r\nconversation. \"Perhaps, Mr. Clifton, if Gordon understood how much you\r\ndisapproved--\" the young organist began.\r\n\r\n\"Gordon? Gordon? it isn't only Gordon who should understand. Every one\r\nshould understand my feeling on such a subject without my having to\r\nexplain it. But I won't keep you any longer now: it is getting late.\r\nRemember, seven o'clock to-morrow evening.\" And with a polite remark or\r\ntwo to the others Mr. Clifton bowed himself out, with Bertie in\r\nattendance. The procession of two might have been more dignified if the\r\norganist had not made a face at Judith and Percival as he went out at\r\nthe door, and if he had not danced a fantastic but noiseless dance on\r\nthe landing behind the incumbent of St. Sylvester's, who was feeling\r\nfeebly in the dim light for the top step of Mrs. Bryant's staircase.\r\n\r\n\"Is anything the matter with Mr. Clifton?\" Judith asked when the boy\r\ncame back and executed another war-dance all round the room. \"He didn't\r\nseem pleased, I thought.\"\r\n\r\nBertie brought himself up with a grand flourish opposite the arm-chair,\r\nand sank into it: \"Bless you, no! there's nothing the matter with him.\r\nTumbled out of bed the wrong side this morning--that's all. He does\r\nsometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might have got over that by this time of night, one would think,\" said\r\nPercival, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Hold hard! you aren't going yet?\" exclaimed Bertie, bounding\r\nup.--\"Here, Judith, let's have another song to take the taste of old\r\nClifton out of our mouths. Whatever possessed him to come here\r\nto-night?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"DRINK TO ME ONLY WITH THINE EYES.\"--Page 298.]\r\n\r\nThey had two or three songs instead of one, and then Percival went off.\r\nJudith put her work away, shut up the piano and laid Bertie's music\r\nstraight. He stood meanwhile with his back to the dying fire, idly\r\nchinking some money which he had taken from his waistcoat-pocket, a\r\nhalf-crown and two or three shillings. His brows were drawn down as if\r\nhe were lost in thought. Presently, his half-crown went spinning in the\r\nair: he caught it dexterously--heads. Bertie half smiled to himself, as\r\nwho should say, \"Well, if Destiny will have it so, what am I that I\r\nshould resist it?\"\r\n\r\nIt is very well to toss up if you have already come to a decision which\r\nyou cannot quite justify. Should the verdict be adverse, it is no worse\r\nthan it was before, for if you have really made up your mind so trivial\r\nan accident will not stop you. It may even be your duty to show that you\r\nattach no superstitious importance to it. And, on the other hand, if\r\nchance favors you, some of your burden of responsibility is transferred\r\nto the shoulders of Fate.\r\n\r\nSo Bertie smiled, pocketed his half-crown, kissed his sister and went\r\noff to his own room, whistling on his way thither with peculiar\r\ndistinctness and perseverance.\r\n\r\nNearly an hour later two figures stood by the dim light in the passage\r\nand conversed in whispers:\r\n\r\n\"Now, my charming Lydia, how about that key?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll 'charming Lydia' you!\" was the reply. \"I like your impudence!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you do. You shall have some more when I've time to spare. But\r\nnow I must really be off. Get me the key, there's a dear girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't, then. If you want a latch-key, why don't you go to ma and say\r\nso like a man? There it is, and you'd have it directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"O most unreasonable Lydia! How many times must I explain to you that\r\nthat wouldn't do, because your ma, while she possesses many of the\r\ncharms, is not quite exempt from the weakness of her sex: in short,\r\nLydia, she talks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then? If I were a man I wouldn't be afraid of my sister. I'd\r\nbe my own master.\"\r\n\r\n\"So will I,\" said Bertie Lisle.\r\n\r\n\"And I'd say what I meant right out. I would!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you knew there'd be a fuss, and people anxious about you, would\r\nyou?\" He yawned. \"No: I'll be my own master, but I like to do things\r\nquietly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care so much about that,\" said Lydia, whose feelings were less\r\ndelicate. To struggle openly for an avowed object seemed to her the\r\nmost natural thing in the world, and she would have preferred her\r\nindependence to be conspicuous. She did not understand that with men of\r\nBertie's stamp it is not the latch-key itself, but the unsuspected\r\nlatch-key, which confers the liberty they love.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said he. \"Am I to stay here all night?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what you'd better do. You won't get any good out of that\r\nlot; and so I tell you. You'll lose your money and get into nasty\r\ndrinking ways: don't you go there any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, Lydia, you preach as well as old Clifton does.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you just as much good, I dare say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as much. You've hit it exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. You aren't the sort to take any heed. One may preach and\r\npreach--\"\r\n\r\n\"How well you understand me! No, as you say, I am not the sort to get\r\nany good from preaching. You are quite right, Lydia: my character\r\nrequires kindness, sympathy and a latch-key--especially requires a\r\nlatch-key.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially requires a fiddlestick!\" said Lydia; and, disregarding his\r\nsmiling \"Not at all,\" she went on in an injured tone: \"There's ma\r\nworrying over accounts, and likely to worry for the next hour. How am I\r\nto get a key from under her very nose?\"\r\n\r\nLisle seemed to reflect: \"Old Fordham doesn't have one, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious! No, not he! If you gave him one he'd drop it as if it was red\r\nhot. He thinks they're wicked.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, but after a few moments there stole through the\r\nsilence a sweetly insinuating voice: \"Then, Lydia--\"\r\n\r\nLydia half turned away and put up her left shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Then, Lydia, I suppose you wouldn't--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better keep on supposing I wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't suppose such cruelty for more than a moment--can't really. No,\r\nlisten to me\"--this with a change of voice: \"I must go out this evening.\r\nUpon my soul, it's important. I'm in a fix, Lydia. I've not breathed a\r\nword to any one else, and wouldn't for worlds, but you'll not let it\r\nout, I know. If I'm lucky enough to get out of the scrape to-night, I'll\r\nnever get into it again, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will,\" said Lydia.\r\n\r\n\"I swear I won't. And if not--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well? if not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I must try another plan to get free. I sha'n't like it, but I\r\nmust. But there'll be a row, and I shall have to go away. I'd a good\r\ndeal rather not.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of plan?\" she asked curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Desperate,\" he answered, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Her eyes were widely opened in excitement and alarm. \"You\r\nain't going to be driven to forge something, like people in novels?\r\nOr--or--it isn't a big robbery, is it? Oh, you wouldn't!\"\r\n\r\nThe face opposite looked so smiling and candid and innocent that it made\r\nthe words she had hazarded an obvious absurdity, even to herself, as\r\nsoon as she had uttered them.\r\n\r\n\"Why not a murder?\" said Lisle. \"I think it shall be a murder. Upon my\r\nword, you're complimentary! No, no, I don't mean to try my hand at any\r\nof them.\" She smiled, relieved. \"But I must go out to-night. Lydia, will\r\nyou let me in once more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once more? You won't ask again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never again.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause: \"Didn't you say that last time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lydia, you are the unkindest girl--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you are the kindest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just this once more. Mind, you tap very gently, and I'll be awake. But\r\ndo be careful. It frightens me so!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the house was full of lodgers the Bryants stowed themselves away in\r\nany odd corners. At this time Lydia occupied a large cupboard--by\r\ncourtesy called a small room--close to their stuffy little back parlor.\r\nLisle would go to the yard behind the house, which was common to two or\r\nthree besides No. 13, and with one foot on a projecting bit of\r\nbrick-work could get his hand on the sill and make his signal.\r\n\r\n\"Some day the police'll take you for a burglar,\" said Lydia\r\nencouragingly. \"Well, go and enjoy yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ a shame to keep you up so long, isn't it? What do you do all\r\nthe time, eh, Lydia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit in the dark, mostly, and think what a fool I'm making of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that. Think how good you are to a poor fellow in trouble. That\r\nwill be better--won't it? But I must be off. Good-bye, you kind Lydia.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped forward and kissed her, taking her hands in his. He found it\r\nconvenient to pay his debt in this coin, his creditor being passably\r\npretty. Not that Bertie had any taste for indiscriminate kissing. Had he\r\nhad five thousand a year, and had Lydia rendered him a service, he would\r\nhave recompensed her with some of his superfluous gold. But as he only\r\nhad his salary as organist and what he could make by giving\r\nmusic-lessons, he paid her with kisses instead. He had no particular\r\nobjection, and was it not his duty to be economical, for Judith's sake\r\nas well as his own?\r\n\r\n\"Go along with you!\" said Lydia; and the young man, who had achieved his\r\npurpose and had no reason for prolonging the interview, stole laughingly\r\ndown stairs, waving a farewell as he vanished round the corner. Lydia\r\nstood as if she were rooted to the ground, listening intently. She heard\r\nthe door opened very gently and closed with infinite precautions. She\r\nstill stood till she had counted a hundred under her breath, and then,\r\njudging that Mrs. Bryant had not been disturbed by his stealthy exit,\r\nshe went down to fasten it. She was prepared with an answer if she\r\nshould be caught in the act, but she was glad to get away undetected,\r\nfor an excuse which is perfectly satisfactory at the time may be very\r\nunsatisfactory indeed when viewed by the light of later events. So Lydia\r\nrejoiced when she found herself safe in her own room, though she pursued\r\nher usual train of meditation in that refuge. She appraised Lisle's\r\ngratitude and kisses pretty accurately, and was angry with herself that\r\nshe should care to have them, knowing that they were worthless. Yet as\r\nshe sat there she said his name to herself, \"Bertie,\" as she had heard\r\nhis sister call him. And she knew well that it was pleasant to her to be\r\nthrilled by Bertie's eyes and lips, pleasant to feel Bertie's soft palms\r\nand slim strong fingers pressing those hands of hers, on which she had\r\njust been trying experiments with a new wash. Lydia looked thoughtfully\r\ninto her looking-glass and took her reflection into her confidence.\r\n\"Ain't you a silly?\" she said to the phantom which fingered its long\r\ncurl and silently moved its lips. \"Oh, you are!\" said the girl, \"and\r\nthere's no denying it.\" She shook her head, and her _vis-a-vis_ shook\r\nits head in the dim dusk, as much as to say, \"No more a fool than you\r\nare yourself, Lydia.\"--\"Nobody could be,\" said Lydia moodily.\r\n\r\nShe did not deem it prudent to keep her light burning very late, and she\r\nhad a long vigil before the signal came, the three soft taps at her\r\nwindow. She was prepared for it. Every sound had grown painfully\r\ndistinct to her anxious ears, and she had been almost certain that she\r\nknew Lisle's hurried yet stealthy step as he turned into the yard. She\r\ncrept to the door and opened it, her practised hand recognizing the\r\nfastenings in the dark. The light from the street-lamp just outside fell\r\non Bertie's white face. \"What luck?\" she asked in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Curse the luck!\" he answered: \"everything went against me from first to\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you so,\" she whispered, closing the door. \"Didn't I say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't! there's a good girl,\" said Bertie softly, somewhere in the\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nLydia was silent, and shot the bolts very skilfully. But the key made a\r\nlittle grating noise as she turned it, and the two stood for a moment\r\nholding their breath.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Lisle after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"It's late,\" said Lydia. He could not deny it. \"You must take your boots\r\noff before you go up,\" she continued. \"And do be careful.\"\r\n\r\nHe obeyed. \"Good-night,\" he whispered. \"You'll see that girl calls me\r\nin good time to-morrow? I feel as if I should sleep for a century or\r\nso.\" He yawned wearily: \"I wish I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ ain't to be sleepy, I suppose: why should I be?\" she answered, but\r\nadded hurriedly, \"No, no, you shall be called all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You good girl!\" whispered Lisle, and he went noiselessly away. A dim\r\ngaslight burned halfway up the stairs and guided him to his room. He had\r\nonly to softly open and close his door, and all was well. Judith had not\r\nbeen awakened by the catlike steps of the man who was not old Fordham.\r\nShe had fallen asleep very happily, with a vague sense of hopefulness\r\nand well-being. She had no idea that Bertie had just flung himself on\r\nhis bed to snatch a little rest, with a trouble on his mind which, had\r\nshe known it, would have effectually banished sleep from her eyes, and a\r\nhope of escape which would have nearly broken her heart. Her burden had\r\nbeen laid aside for a few hours, and through her dreams there ran a\r\ngolden thread of melody, the unconscious remembrance of that evening's\r\nsongs and music.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nBERTIE AT THE ORGAN.\r\n\r\nBertie was duly called, and came down the next morning punctually\r\nenough, but somewhat weary and pale. A slight headache was supposed to\r\naccount for his looks. Lydia complained of the same thing over her\r\nbreakfast of bacon down stairs. But Fate was partial, for Bertie's\r\nmarble pallor and the faint shadow beneath his eyes were utterly unlike\r\npoor Lydia's dull complexion and heavy, red-rimmed eyelids. She was\r\nconscious of this injustice, and felt in a dim way that she had proved\r\nherself capable of one of those acts of self-devotion which are the more\r\nadmirable that they are sure not to be admired. But the longer she\r\nthought of it the more she felt that this noble deed was not one to be\r\nrepeated. One must set bounds to one's heroism. \"I can't go on losing my\r\nbeauty-sleep in this fashion,\" said Lydia to herself. \"I do look such a\r\nhorrid fright the next day.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Judith had gone to Standon Square, Bertie yawned, stretched\r\nhimself, got out his little writing-case and sat down to write a letter.\r\nHe spent some time over it, erasing and interlining, balancing himself\r\non two legs of his chair, while he looked for stray words on the ceiling\r\nor murmured occasional sentences to judge of the effect. At last it was\r\nfinished, and, being copied in a dashing hand, looked very spontaneous\r\nindeed. \"I think that ought to do it,\" he said to himself as he smoked\r\nhis pipe, glancing over the pages: \"I think it _will_ do it.\" He smiled,\r\nin the pride of triumphant authorship, but presently there came a line\r\nbetween his brows and a puzzled expression to his face: \"I'll be shot if\r\nI know how it is to be managed afterward. People do it, but how? I\r\nwonder if Thorne knows? If law is at all catching, a year of that musty\r\noffice must have given him a touch of it.\" Lisle considered the matter\r\nfor a few minutes, and then shrugged his shoulders: \"It won't do, I'm\r\nafraid. I daren't try him. I'm never quite clear how much he sees and\r\nunderstands, nor what he would do. And Gordon? No.\" There was another\r\nreverie. Finally, he arose, knocked the ashes out of his pipe and\r\nstretched himself once more: \"I've got to depend on myself, it seems to\r\nme. I must set my wits to work and astonish them all. But oh, if yawning\r\nwere but a lucrative employment, how easily I could make money and be\r\nquit of the whole affair!\"\r\n\r\nBertie took a great interest in his personal appearance, and was frank\r\nand unaffected in his consciousness of his good looks. He caught a\r\nglimpse of his reflection in the bottle-green mirror, and stopped short\r\nin considerable anxiety. \"Brain-work and these late hours don't suit\r\nme,\" he said. \"Good Heavens! I look quite careworn. Well, it may pass\r\nfor the effect of a gradually breaking heart: why not?\"\r\n\r\nA glance at his watch roused him to sudden activity. He carefully burnt\r\nevery scrap of his original manuscript, feeling sure that Lydia would\r\nread his letter if she had the chance. He looked leniently on this\r\nlittle weakness of hers. \"Very happy to afford you what little amusement\r\nI can in the general way,\" he soliloquized as he directed an envelope,\r\n\"but I really can't allow you to read this letter, Lydia my dear.\"\r\nApparently, he was in a distrustful mood, for, after hesitating a\r\nmoment, he got some wax and sealed it with a ring he wore. Then, putting\r\nit carefully in his pocket, he tossed a few sheets of blotted\r\nmusic-paper on the table, left his writing-case wide open, took his hat\r\nand a roll of music, and went out in the direction of St. Sylvester's,\r\ntrying to work out his problem as he walked. He was not, however, so\r\ndeep in thought that he had no eyes for the passers-by, and his\r\nattention was suddenly attracted by a servant-girl dawdling along the\r\nopposite pavement. He watched her keenly, but furtively, as if to make\r\nquite sure, and when she turned down a side street he followed, and\r\nspeedily overtook her.\r\n\r\n\"This is lucky!\" he ejaculated. \"I didn't expect to see you, Susan. What\r\nare you doing here?\"\r\n\r\nShe was a slight, plain girl, with a fairly intelligent face whose\r\nexpression was doubtful. Sometimes it showed a willingness to please,\r\noftener it was sullen, now and then merely thoughtful. Just at this\r\nmoment, as she looked up at the young organist, it was crafty and\r\ngreedy. \"I'm taking a note,\" she said. \"Miss Crawford's always a-sending\r\nme with notes or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mind being sent with notes, do you?\" said Bertie blandly.\r\n\r\n\"That's as may be,\" the girl answered.\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought it was pleasant work. At any rate, it's as easy\r\nto take two as one, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to take 'em, 'cause I'm paid to, you see, easy or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course you ought to be paid.\" His fingers were in his\r\nwaistcoat-pocket, and some coins that chinked agreeably were transferred\r\nto her hand, together with the sealed letter. \"You've saved me a walk to\r\nStandon Square,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed, looking down at her money: \"It wouldn't have hurt\r\nyou, I dare say. You oughtn't to make much of a walk there. How about an\r\nanswer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shall get an answer when I come to-morrow.\" He nodded a careless\r\nfarewell, and went a little out of his way to avoid Gordon's brother,\r\nwho was visible in the distance.\r\n\r\nSusan turned the missive over in her hand. \"It's sealed tight enough,\"\r\nshe remarked to herself. \"What did he want to do that for?\" She eyed it\r\ndiscontentedly: \"I hate such suspicious ways. Wouldn't there be a\r\nflare-up if I just handed it over to the old maid? I won't, though, for\r\nshe's give me warning, and he's a deal more free with his money than\r\nshe'd ever be--stingy old cat! But wouldn't there be a flare-up? My!\"\r\nAnd Susan, who had an ungratified taste for the sensational, looked at\r\nthe address and smiled to think of the power she possessed.\r\n\r\nBefore she slipped the letter into her pocket she sniffed doubtfully at\r\nthe envelope, and tossed her head in scorn: \"I thought so! Smells of\r\ntobacco.\" It was true, for Lisle, as we know, had smoked while he\r\nrevised his composition. \"If I were a young man going a-courting I'd\r\nscent my letters with rose or something nice, and I'd write 'em on pink\r\npaper--I would!\" Susan reflected. But Lisle was wiser. There is no\r\nperfume for a young ladies' school like a whiff of cigar-smoke. To that\r\nprim, half convent-like seclusion, where manners are being formed and\r\nthe proprieties are strictly observed, it comes as a pleasant suggestion\r\nof something worldly and masculine, just a little wicked and altogether\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\nSo Lisle went on his way to St. Sylvester's, lighter of heart for having\r\nmet Susan and got rid of the letter. While it was still in his pocket\r\nnothing was absolutely settled, in spite of that half-crown which had\r\nrepresented inexorable Destiny the night before. But now that it was\r\ngone, further thought about it was happily unnecessary, and honor\r\nforbade him to draw back. It was true, however, that he was still face\r\nto face with the difficulty which had been in his mind when he met his\r\nmessenger so conveniently.\r\n\r\nHe caught a street Arab, and promised him twopence if he would come and\r\nblow for him while he practised. But he began by playing absently and\r\ncarelessly, for since the letter had been despatched his problem had\r\nbecome infinitely more urgent, and it thrust itself between him and the\r\nmusic. His fingers roved dreamily over the keys, his eyes wandered, as\r\nif in spite of himself, to the east end of the church. All at once he\r\ncame out with an impatient \"How _do_ people manage it?\" and he finished\r\nthe muttered question with a strong word and a big chord.\r\n\r\nA moment more, and his face is illuminated with the inward light of a\r\nsudden idea. He lets his hands lie where they happen to be, he sits\r\nthere with parted lips and startled eyes. The idea is almost too\r\nwonderful, too simple, too obvious, and yet--\"By Jove!\" says Bertie,\r\nunder his breath.\r\n\r\nHis street Arab means to earn his twopence, and in spite of the silence\r\nhe pumps away in a cheerful and conscientious manner till he shall be\r\nbidden to stop. The organ protests in a long and dolorous note, and\r\nstartles the musician from his reverie. Forthwith he begins to play a\r\nstirring march, and the rejoicing chords arise and rush and crowd\r\nbeneath his fingers. Has he indeed found the solution of his great\r\nperplexity? Apparently he thinks so. He seems absolutely hurried along\r\nin triumph on these waves of jubilant harmony. A ray of pale March\r\nsunlight falls on his forehead and shines on his hair as he tosses his\r\nhead in the quickening excitement of the moment. His headache is gone,\r\nhis weariness is gone. The notes seem to gather like bands of armed men\r\nand rush victoriously through the aisles. But even as he plays he laughs\r\nto himself, a boyish, happy laugh, for this great idea which is to help\r\nhim out of all his difficulties is not only a great idea, but a great\r\njoke. And the march rings louder yet, for with every note he plays his\r\nthought grows clearer to his mind, plainer and more feasible. There is\r\na gay audacity about the laugh which lingers in Bertie's eyes and on his\r\nlips, as if Dan Cupid himself had just been there, whispering some\r\nchoice scheme of roguish knavery, some artful artlessness, into the\r\nyoung man's ear. Bertie does not acknowledge that his inspiration has\r\ncome in such a questionable fashion. He says to himself, \"It will do: I\r\nfeel it will do. Isn't it providential? Just when I was in despair!\"\r\nThis is a more suitable sentiment for an organist, no doubt, for what\r\npossible business can Dan Cupid have at St. Sylvester's? Louder and\r\nlouder yet pours the great stream of music; and that is a joke too, for\r\nLisle feels as if he were shouting his secret to the four winds, and yet\r\nkeeping it locked in his inmost soul, taking the passers-by into his\r\nconfidence in the most open-hearted fashion, and laughing at them in his\r\nsleeve. But the musician is exhausted at last, and the end comes with a\r\nthundering crash of chords.\r\n\r\n\"Here, boy--here's sixpence for you: you may be off. We've done enough\r\nfor to-day, and may go home to Bellevue street.\" But it seems to Bertie\r\nLisle, as he picks up his roll of music and comes down the aisle, that\r\nBellevue street too is only a joke now.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nWHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY.\r\n\r\nApril had come, and the best of the year was beginning with a yellow\r\ndawn of daffodils. The trees stood stern and wintry, but there were\r\nlittle leaves on the honeysuckles and the hawthorn hedges, glad\r\noutbursts of song among the branches, and soft, shy caresses in the air.\r\nSissy Langton, riding into Fordborough, was delicately beautiful as\r\nspring itself. She missed her squire of an earlier April, and his\r\nabsence made an underlying sadness in her radiant eyes which had the\r\nApril charm. That day her glance and smile had an especial brightness,\r\npartly because spring had come, and, though countless springs have\r\npassed away, each comes with the old yet ever-fresh assurance that it\r\nwill make all things new; partly because it was her birthday, and while\r\nwe are yet young there is a certain joy of royalty which marks our\r\nbirthday mornings; but most of all because that day gave her the power\r\nto satisfy a desire which had lain hidden in her heart through the long\r\nwinter months.\r\n\r\nIt was the Fordborough market-day, and already, though it was but eleven\r\no'clock, the little town was waking up. Sissy, followed by Mrs.\r\nMiddleton's staid servant, rode straight to the principal street and\r\nstopped at Mr. Hardwicke's office. Young Hardwicke, reading the paper in\r\nhis room, was surprised when a clerk announced that Miss Langton was at\r\nthe door asking for his father. He forgot the sporting intelligence in\r\nan instant: \"Well, isn't my father in?\"\r\n\r\nNo: Mr. Hardwicke went out about twenty minutes earlier, and did not say\r\nwhen he should be back. They had told Miss Langton, and she said,\r\n\"Perhaps Mr. Henry--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Henry was off like a shot. He found Sissy on her horse at the door,\r\nlooking pensively along the street, as if she were studying the effect\r\nof dusky red on palest blue--chimney-pots against the April sky.\r\n\r\n\"So Mr. Hardwicke is out?\" she said when they had shaken hands. \"I'm so\r\nsorry! I wanted him so particularly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it important? Are you in a great hurry?\" said Henry. \"He won't be\r\nlong, or he would certainly have left word--on a market-day especially.\r\nCould you come in and wait a little while?\" he suggested. \"I suppose I\r\nshouldn't do as well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Sissy, looking a little doubtfully at the tall,\r\nfresh-colored young fellow, who smiled frankly in reply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it isn't at all likely,\" said Mr. Henry with delightful candor.\r\n\"The governor can't, for the life of him, understand how I make so many\r\nblunders. I've a special talent that way, I suppose, but I don't know\r\nhow I came by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps it had better be Mr. Hardwicke. If it were a waltz,\r\nnow--\" and she laughed. \"But it isn't a waltz: it is something very\r\nimportant. Do you know anything about wills?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up in sudden apprehension: \"Is it about a will? Mrs.\r\nMiddleton's? Is anything the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't Aunt Middleton's: it's mine,\" was the composed reply. But\r\nseeing relief, and almost amusement, on his face, she added hastily, \"I\r\n_can_ make a will, can't I? I'm twenty-one, you know: it's my birthday\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I wish you many happy returns of the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, but can I make a will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can make a will.\"\r\n\r\n\"A will that will be good?\" Sissy insisted, still speaking in the low\r\ntone she had adopted when she began to explain the object of her visit.\r\n\"Can I make it here and now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on horseback, I think,\" said Hardwicke with a smile. \"You would be\r\ntired of sitting here while we took down all your instructions. It isn't\r\nvery quick work making ladies' wills. They generally leave no end of\r\nlegacies. I suppose they are so good they don't forget anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine won't be like that: mine will be very short,\" Sissy said. \"And I\r\nsuppose I am not good, for I shall forget almost everybody in it.\" She\r\nlaughed as she said it, yet something in her voice struck Hardwicke as\r\ncuriously earnest. \"I will come in, I think, and tell you about it,\" she\r\nwent on. \"I want to make it to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day?\" he repeated as he helped her to dismount.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'll tell you,\" said Sissy, entering his room, \"and you'll tell\r\nMr. Hardwicke, won't you? I'll get the Elliotts to give me some\r\nluncheon, and then I can come here again between two and three. I shall\r\nhave to sign it, or something, sha'n't I? Do tell your father I want it\r\nall to be finished to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him it's my birthday, so of course I must do just as I please and\r\nhave everything I want to-day. I don't know whether that's the law, but\r\nI'm sure it ought to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it ought to be,\" Henry replied with fervor. \"And I think we\r\ncan undertake to say that it shall be our law, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Sissy. \"I shall be so very glad! And it can't take\r\nlong. I only want him to say that I wish all that I have to go to\r\nPercival Thorne.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Percival?\" Hardwicke repeated, with a sensation as if she had\r\nsuddenly stabbed him. \"To Percival Thorne? Yes. Is that all I am to\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all. I want it all to be for Percival Thorne, to do just what he\r\nlikes with it. That can't take long, surely.\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke bit the end of a penholder that he had picked up, and looked\r\nuneasily at her: \"You're awfully anxious to get this done, Miss Langton:\r\nyou aren't ill, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm well enough--much better than I was last year,\" said Sissy\r\nlightly. \"But there's no good in putting things of this sort off, you\r\nknow\"--she dropped her voice--\"as poor Mr. Thorne did. And your father\r\nsaid once that if I didn't make a will when I came of age my money would\r\nall go to Sir Charles Langton. He doesn't really want any more, I should\r\nthink, for they say he is very rich. And he is only a second cousin of\r\nmine, and I have never seen him. It's funny, having so few relations,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said Hardwicke.\r\n\r\n\"And some people have such a lot,\" said Sissy thoughtfully. \"But I\r\nalways feel as if the Thornes were my relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so. At any rate, I don't see that Sir Charles Langton has any\r\nclaim upon you.\" There was silence for a minute, Sissy drawing an\r\nimaginary outline on Hardwicke's carpet with her riding-whip, he\r\nfollowing her every movement with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to sign both my Christian names, I suppose?\" she said\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Have you two? I didn't know. What is the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jane! I like that,\" said Henry. \"Yes, sign them both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I don't want to seem like an idiot to your father. I should\r\nlike it best if I could just write 'Sissy' and nothing else, as I do at\r\nthe end of my letters. When I see 'Cecilia Jane Langton' I feel inclined\r\nto call out, 'This is none of I!' like the old woman.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood up to go: \"You won't forget, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything to Percival Thorne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Percival Thorne is an uncommonly lucky fellow,\" said the young man,\r\nlooking down.\r\n\r\nSissy stopped short, glanced at him and colored. In her anxiety she had\r\nnever considered the light in which the bequest might strike Henry\r\nHardwicke. In fact, she had not thought of him at all except as a\r\nmessenger. She was accustomed to take him for granted on any occasion.\r\nShe had known him all her life, and he was always, in her eyes, the big\r\nfriendly boy with whom she pulled crackers and played blindman's buff at\r\nchildren's parties. She dreamed of no possible romance with Henry, and\r\ndid not imagine that he could have such a dream about her. He was as\r\nharmless as a brother, without a brother's right to question and\r\ncriticise. It was precisely that feeling which had been at the root of\r\nthe friendliness which the Fordborough gossips took for a flirtation.\r\nThey could not have been more utterly mistaken. She liked Henry\r\nHardwicke--she knew that he was honest and honorable and good--but if\r\nany one had said that he was a worthy young man, I believe she would\r\nhave assented. And that is the last adjective which a girl would apply\r\nto her ideal.\r\n\r\nSissy's scheme had been in her mind through all the winter, but she had\r\nalways imagined herself stating her intentions in a business-like way to\r\nold Mr. Hardwicke, who was a friend of the family. She had been so\r\nthunder-struck when she found that he was out that she had taken Henry\r\ninto her confidence at a moment's warning. She dared not risk any delay.\r\nIt would be impossible to go home leaving Percival's future insecure.\r\nSuppose she died that night--and she was struck with the fantastic\r\ncoincidence of Mr. Hardwicke's second absence at the critical\r\nmoment--suppose she felt herself dying, and knew that the only thing she\r\ncould have done for Percival was left undone! She could not face the\r\npossibility of that agony. Indeed, she wondered how she had lived\r\nthrough the long hours which had elapsed since the clock struck twelve\r\nand the day began which made her twenty-one--not the girl Sissy any\r\nlonger, but the woman who held Percival's fortune in her hands. How\r\ncould she have gone away with her purpose unfulfilled?\r\n\r\nWhen Henry said \"Percival Thorne is an uncommonly lucky fellow,\" she\r\ncolored, but only that transient flush betrayed her, for she answered\r\nreadily: \"Why, Mr. Hardwicke, what a dreadful thing to say to me! I hope\r\nyou don't have second-sight or anything horrible of that sort?\"\r\n\r\n\"Second-sight!\" Henry repeated doubtfully, looking down at a little\r\ndangling eye-glass: \"what's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you must know. Isn't it second-sight when you can tell if people\r\nare going to die? You see them in their winding-sheets, and they are low\r\ndown if it will only be rather soon. But if it is to be quite directly\r\ntheir shrouds are wrapped round them high up. What was mine like, that\r\nyou said Percival Thorne was so lucky? Up to here?\" And, standing before\r\nhim, she smiled and touched her chin.\r\n\r\n\"God forbid!\" said Henry. \"How can you say such fearful things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you didn't see it, then? I'm very glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens! no! And I don't believe it. I didn't mean that Thorne\r\nwould be lucky if you _died_!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't do him any good any other way,\" said Sissy with sweet\r\ncomposure; \"but I don't think I'm going to die, so I don't suppose I\r\nshall do him any good at all. Do you think this is a strange fancy of\r\nmine? The truth is, Aunt Middleton and I have been unhappy about\r\nPercival ever since last May, because we know his grandfather meant to\r\nhave done something for him. He isn't rich, and he ought to have had\r\nBrackenhill; so I should like him to have my money if I die. It is only\r\na chance, because I dare say I may live fifty years or so--only\r\nfancy!--but I would rather Percival had the chance than Sir Charles.\r\nThat's all. You'll explain it to your father? It can't do any harm if it\r\ndoes no good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no: I see. It can't do any harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now I'll be off,\" laughed Sissy. \"How dreadfully I have made you\r\nwaste your time! I dare say if I hadn't been here you would have written\r\never so many things on parchment and tied them up with red tape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, quantities!\" Hardwicke replied as he escorted her to the door.\r\n\"A cartload at least. I'm glad you think I'm so industrious.\"\r\n\r\nStanding outside, he said something about her horse. He did not like\r\nFirefly's look, and he told her so. Moreover, he threatened to tell Mrs.\r\nMiddleton his bad opinion of Sissy's favorite.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" she answered lightly. \"There's nothing to be afraid of.\" But\r\nsuddenly she turned and looked at him. \"Don't you really think Firefly\r\nis safe?\" she said. \"Well, I must see about it.--William, I'm not going\r\nback now, and I think I'll walk to Mrs. Elliott's. You had better meet\r\nme here at half-past two.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a parting glance at Hardwicke she went away down the sunshiny\r\nstreet, and he stood looking after her. He would have liked to be her\r\nescort to the Elliotts' house, but he had her message to deliver to his\r\nfather, and he knew she would not permit it. Besides, to tell the truth,\r\nshe had taken him by surprise, and gone away before he thought of\r\nanything of the kind. So he could only stand bareheaded on the\r\noffice-steps watching her as she went on her way. But suddenly his lips\r\nparted to let out a word, which certainly would not have escaped him had\r\nhe been by Sissy's side. \"There's that Fothergill fellow!\" said Henry,\r\nrecognizing the captain's slim figure and black moustache. And he turned\r\non his heel and went in.\r\n\r\nHe was quite right. It was Fothergill who came sauntering along the\r\npavement, looking at the shop-windows, at the passers-by, at the\r\npreparations for the market, with quick eyes and an interest which\r\nconveyed the impression of his superiority to it all better than any\r\naffectation of languid indifference. His glances seemed to say, \"And\r\nthis is a country town--a market--these are farmers--people live here\r\nall their lives!\" But when he saw Sissy Langton he came forward eagerly.\r\nAnd perhaps it was just as well that he was at hand to be her squire\r\nthrough the busy little street, for the girl was seized with a new and\r\nunaccountable nervousness. A bit of orange-peel lying in the road caused\r\nher a sudden tremor. Two or three meek and wondering cows, which gazed\r\nvacantly round in search of their familiar pasture, appeared to her as a\r\nherd of savage brutes. She looked distrustfully up and down the road,\r\nand waited at the pavement's edge for a donkey-cart to pass before she\r\ndared attempt a crossing. It was just at this moment that the captain\r\nappeared, quickening his pace and lifting his hat, only too ready to\r\nguard her through all the perils of a Fordborough market-day.\r\n\r\nHenry Hardwicke hated reading, and had no particular love for the law.\r\nHis father said he was a fool, and was inordinately fond of him\r\nnevertheless. It might be that the old lawyer was right on both points.\r\nAnd, dull as Henry was supposed to be, he was capable of delicate\r\nfeelings and perceptions as far as Sissy Langton was concerned. It\r\nseemed to him that accident had revealed to him a hidden wound in her\r\nheart; and the revelation pained him--not selfishly, for he had never\r\nhoped for himself, but because of the secret suffering which it implied.\r\nHis one idea was to do her bidding, yet not betray her. He delivered her\r\nmessage to his father with a tact of which he was himself unconscious.\r\nOn his lips it became no less urgent, but he dwelt especially on Sissy's\r\ndesire to see justice done to the man who had been accidentally\r\ndisinherited; on her feeling that she owed more to the Thornes, whose\r\nhome and love she had shared, than to the Langtons, with whom she\r\nshared nothing but a name; and on her impatience of even an hour's\r\ndelay, because the squire's sudden death had made a deep impression on\r\nher mind. All this, translated into Harry's blunt and simple speech, was\r\nintelligible enough to Mr. Hardwicke. The girlish whim that all should\r\nbe done on her birthday made him smile, but the remembrance of Godfrey\r\nThorne was present in his mind as in hers. He did not attach much\r\nimportance to the whole affair, and felt that he should not be\r\noverwhelmed with surprise should he hear a few months later that Sissy\r\nwas going to be married to some one else, and wanted to make some\r\ncompromise--perhaps to resign the squire's legacy to Percival. To his\r\neyes it looked more like an attempt at restitution than anything else.\r\n\"She is sorry for him, poor fellow!\" thought Mr. Hardwicke. \"She did not\r\nknow her own mind, and now she would like to atone to him somehow.\"\r\n\r\nSissy came back alone at the time she had fixed, looking white and\r\nanxious. A client came out as she arrived, and five farmers were waiting\r\nin the office to see Mr. Hardwicke: therefore, though she was ushered in\r\nat once, the interview was brief. The old lawyer paid her a smiling\r\ncompliment on her promptitude. \"We have to advise people to make their\r\nwills sometimes,\" he said, \"but you are beforehand with us.\" Sissy\r\nexpressed a fear that she had troubled him on a very busy day, and he\r\nassured her that to blame her because her twenty-first birthday happened\r\nto fall on a Friday would be the last thing he should think of doing.\r\nThen the girl looked up at him, and said that old Mr. Thorne had always\r\nbeen so good to her, and she thought that perhaps if he could see he\r\nwould be glad, so she could not put it off. She stopped abruptly, and\r\nher eyes filled. Mr. Hardwicke bent his head in silent acquiescence, the\r\nbrief document was duly signed and witnessed, and Sissy went away,\r\nriding home as if she had never known what fear meant. Suppose Firefly\r\nthrew her, what then? She had been to Mr. Hardwicke, and though her\r\n\"Cecilia Jane Langton\" was not all she could have wished, because she\r\nwas nervous and Mr. Hardwicke's pen was so scratchy, still there it was.\r\nAnd was not the paper, thus signed, a talisman against all dread of\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\nSo her burden was lighter. But what could lighten the other load which\r\nlay on her heart? She hardly knew whether it were love or fear that she\r\nfelt for Percival. The long days which had passed since she saw him had\r\nonly deepened the impression of that summer evening when they parted.\r\nHis reply to her entreaty that he would come back to her had been\r\nexactly what she had feared--as gentle as he himself had been when they\r\nstood face to face in the old drawing-room at Brackenhill, and as\r\ninflexible. If she could forget him--if she could learn to care for\r\nCaptain Fothergill or Walter Latimer--what a bright, easy, sunshiny life\r\nmight yet be hers! No, ten thousand times, no! Better to suffer the\r\nweariness of dread and doubt and longing for Percival.\r\n\r\nBut Percival would have been astonished if he could have seen the darkly\r\nheroic guise in which he reigned over Sissy Langton's dreams.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOY ON A HILL-FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like a wide horizon to give a boy aspirations--nothing\r\nlike a hill-farm to give him hope--especially the hope of leaving it. In\r\nspring, on a day of expectation, when the warm air has not yet brought\r\nout the flowers, and carts go past with loads of young trees whose dry\r\nroots and branches look like emblems of old hopes still unfulfilled, a\r\nboy is working on the top of Ford Hill. The five-inch soil covering the\r\nsolid rock that forms the New York hill--the first of all, perhaps, to\r\nshow its head above the pristine waters--has nourished a lofty forest\r\nwhich, battling with everlasting winds, resembles a body of men strong\r\nfrom incessant toil: its elms and beeches are so tough they defy the\r\nforester, and are fit only for water-wheel shafts. Working among these\r\nadamantine timbers, the boy stops to look across the broad and deep\r\nvalley. Not at the old hill-quarries opposite, in whose depths snow lies\r\nall summer, does he look, nor at the hanging woods above the new piece,\r\nnor at the yellow farmhouse and barn; but higher, toward the west,\r\nwhere, on a level with his eye, 'twixt hills like cloud-banks, he sees a\r\nwhite streak, the distant lake. Storms are running down the Deerfield\r\nhills. In one of the woody valleys rain-clouds have formed a mirage,\r\nanother seeming lake, and from its bosom rise to the clear, fine air of\r\nthe hills the muffled clangor and whistle of the New York Central train,\r\nin the boy's mind a glittering image fleeing to splendid cities, and one\r\nthat he longs to follow.\r\n\r\nA boy has no perception whatsoever of the poetry of farm-life: he\r\nconsiders a woodman's work crabbed prose. The idea of making poetry out\r\nof any part of it, or out of a herder's work either, is to him stark\r\nidiocy. Sheep-washing, for instance, is simply working a whole spring\r\nday in very chilly water, and sheep-shearing is a task at which he makes\r\n\"ridgy\" work and endures the horror of seeing the gentle, thin-skinned\r\ncreatures bleed under his awkward shears. The boy cannot conceive what\r\npoetry there is about oxen. From the moment a calf hides in the hay with\r\nits mother's help, and makes believe there is no calf born yet, until it\r\nbecomes an ox, it cannot for an instant be considered poetic by a boy.\r\nThe calf is a creature that insists, whenever it drinks, on thrusting\r\nits head to the bottom of the pail with a splash that deluges the boy\r\nwith milk: it drinks until it is out of breath, and then withdraws its\r\nhead with another splash and an explosion of milk-steam from its\r\nnostrils--performances which cause the boy's friends to remark wherever\r\nhe goes, \"You smell of sour milk.\" The boy likes well enough to feed the\r\noxen their full measures of meal; he likes to see them get down on their\r\nknees to lick up morsels that roll into corners of the stable-floor; he\r\nstretches his hand in before them for little balls of meal they cannot\r\nreach with their long tongues, at which they draw back with a thwack\r\nagainst the stanchion, breathing hard and gazing at him with their large\r\nblack eyes; and when the off ox tries to capture the nigh ox's portion,\r\nthe boy raps him back to his place. Quite a pastoral friendship exists\r\nbetween the boy and the nigh ox, which, being continually bullied by the\r\noff ox, needs the boy's protection, and is therefore placed next him at\r\nwork. But, for all that, he does not see the romance of such matters.\r\n\r\nThe yoking of oxen is decidedly not matter for a flying smile to a boy.\r\nHe lays one end of the yoke's beam on the ground, lifts the other end\r\nwith his right hand, and, waving one of the ox-bows in his left, cries\r\nto the nigh ox, \"Come under!\" The \"nigh\" slowly obeys, bending its head\r\nlow to accommodate the boy's stature, and permitting itself to be\r\nfastened by the ox-bow to the yoke. The boy now lifts the free end of\r\nthe yoke's beam as high as he can and calls the off ox to come under. It\r\nalso obeys, treading deliberately with its heavy feet, and waiting\r\npatiently for the boy's small fingers to fasten the weighty bow with a\r\nclumsy bow-key. Then the boy lifts the ponderous cart-neap and attaches\r\nit to the ring in the yoke--a labor that causes his heart to \"beat like\r\na tabor;\" and thus the beasts are wedded to their daily toil.\r\nOccasionally, however, the ox will not come under at all, but will\r\nrequire the boy to follow it about the barnyard, dragging the jingling\r\nyoke and waving the bow with infinite fatigue; and occasionally the boy\r\nmakes the mistake (no greater could be made) of yoking the off ox first.\r\nThe off ox, finding a yoke sans yokefellow dangling at its neck, is much\r\namazed, not being \"broke\" to that, and takes to whirling round and round\r\nand galloping up and down the barnyard in a manner suggestive of\r\nnightmare. This is a circumstance that makes a boy hopeful of going\r\nsomewhere else.\r\n\r\nThe yoking of oxen, though difficult, is nothing compared with the\r\nworking of oxen. The boy can direct his plough lightly along its\r\nstraight furrow, anticipating each movement of his oxen, and he can turn\r\na corner \"straight as a bug's leg;\" nevertheless, he would like those\r\npersons who have a Wordsworthian idea of following the plough along the\r\nmountain-side in glory and in joy to witness the struggles of a green\r\nhand learning to plough--of a tramp hired man, say, one of the sort that\r\ncan't milk and don't know \"haw\" from \"gee.\" This miserable being tires\r\nhimself out doing nothing. He cannot lay a furrow over sod downward: he\r\nhas to stop and turn it over with his hands. He leaves patches of turf.\r\nHe does not touch up his oxen scientifically, the \"nigh\" on the head,\r\nthe \"off\" on the rump: therefore they frequently do not move at all. His\r\nplough-point hits the stones, and his plough-handles knock him in the\r\nribs and lay him out. If he is ploughing near the barn, which is the\r\nhome of the oxen, approaching it, they go like lightning, and he must\r\ndrop the plough and rush at their heads to keep them from running\r\nstraight into the barn: leaving it, they creep like snails, and perhaps\r\nthey take to \"pulling\"--that is, walking sidewise, with their bodies as\r\nfar apart as possible; or to \"crowding\"--leaning against each other over\r\nthe chain that holds the plough to the yoke, and one of them gets its\r\nfoot on the chain and proceeds on three feet. If the tramp hired man\r\ngoes between them to adjust the chain, the oxen squeeze him flat, and\r\none ox steps on his toe. The toe goes Pop! and what anguish! The ox\r\ncannot be made to understand that it must step off. No use in saying\r\n\"Highst!\" or anything else. Nothing but kicking the ox in the leg with\r\nyour free foot will stir it. In addition to these troubles of the\r\nox-driver, the oxen know how to \"turn the yoke:\" they can twist their\r\nheads in the yoke after a fashion that enables them to stand facing the\r\nplough and staring at the driver. If they \"turn the yoke\" while drawing\r\na cart down a side-hill, the cart, with the driver in it, slips about in\r\nfront of them, and drags them down the gulf face foremost. The noisiest\r\nbeing on earth is a man ploughing with a pair of old bulls. At night,\r\nwhen he comes home to supper, he is scarcely able to whisper, and the\r\nparting blow he gives his beasts is no damage to them nor consolation to\r\nhim. A man ploughing green sward with two old plugs of horses is about\r\nas miserable.\r\n\r\nCows, whether the fine old \"line-backs\" of the hills or scrawny,\r\nbeefless Alderneys or milkless Durhams, have one merit with a boy. It is\r\nnot that they enjoy fine weather, a good pasture and a green\r\nlandscape--have thoughts, notice the sprouting beanfields as they come\r\nup to milking, and the new flag-staff on the green: it is that they are\r\ngood at fighting. In every herd there is a queen who can vanquish all\r\nthe rest, and a vice-queen who can vanquish all but the queen, and a\r\nsecond vice-queen who can vanquish all but the first two, and so on down\r\nto the weakest of the herd, who cannot withstand any of the others.\r\nSometimes there is one that can defeat the queen, but none of the rest;\r\nand other complications occur that give diversity to the cow-fights. The\r\nboy has comfort superintending these combats. He encourages the cowards\r\nand helps the weak by drawing them forward by the horns to attack. When\r\nthe queen stops the way at the bars, and will not let the rest through,\r\nor when she amuses herself running up and down the stanchions driving\r\naway the other cows, the boy puts her down and relieves the drove of her\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nThe boy oversees some fighting among the fowls of the hill-farm, where\r\nthey still keep the old hawk-colored breed--a breed that fights to the\r\ndeath--not being over-partial as yet to Shanghais that won't lay and\r\nLeghorns that won't sit. On a large farm, where there are several barns\r\nand as many sets of hens, the boy cultivates the fighting qualities of\r\nthe cocks by keeping them around together, and not letting them forget\r\neach other. The turkeys--strange birds! so tender in youth a spring rain\r\nkills them, so tough in age they roost in the tree-tops in winter, and\r\ncome down o' mornings covered with frozen sleet and looking as if they\r\nenjoyed it--are objects of no interest to the boy; but for the geese he\r\nhas a kindness, not because they fight each other, but because they\r\nfight him. \"Can't you let them geese alone?\" is the frequent exclamation\r\nof the hired man in the stable to the boy in the mow. The boy is always\r\nperfectly willing to hunt goose-eggs: he has a battle with the biting,\r\nshrieking, wing-flapping goose every time he takes an egg from her nest.\r\nWhen she begins to sit on her empty nest, it is his business to bring\r\nback a part of her eggs and place them under her, which leads to a\r\npitched battle. The pea-hen is a different creature: she keeps her nest\r\na secret even from the peacock, never leaving it save on the wing, and\r\napproaching it with the greatest circumambulation. Nobody but the boy\r\nknows where it is. Should he take up her egg, though he might lay it\r\ndown exactly as it was before, she would never lay another egg there.\r\nThis he knows. He is acquainted with many things other people have no\r\nidea of. He knows how a roost of poultry looks at morning dusk, when, if\r\nyou enter the barn, the entire roost turns one eye at you, and then for\r\nan unknown cause simultaneously shakes its head. He knows how hens catch\r\nmice in the hay-mow--how they gnaw the sucking pigs' tails to the bone\r\n(the hired man says they need the meat). He knows how to obtain\r\nbumblebees' honey, paying for this information with an ear like a garnet\r\npotato, one of the sort that \"biles up meller;\" and he knows how to find\r\nmushrooms. Life for a boy on an upland farm is to labor, to abstain, to\r\nsweat and to be grievously cold (see Horace); nevertheless, there comes\r\na soft spring dawn when on the rich spots of the sheep-pasture he finds\r\na bushel of mushrooms, snow-white on their tops and pink underneath,\r\ncrisp, tender, rising full grown from the moist earth, and lifting\r\nbodily away the chips and leaves that overlay them. He brings this\r\ntreasure home. He inverts the mushroom-cups in a clean frying-pan, fills\r\neach one with butter and a pinch of salt, cooks them gently a few\r\nminutes--dishes them. Then he dashes more butter and some water from the\r\ntea-kettle into the frying-pan--for he is as fond of gravy as \"Todgers'\r\nboarders\"--pours this over the mushrooms, and sits down to a feast that\r\nhas some poetry about it.\r\n\r\nThe boy brings a sharp appetite to his few pleasures. All agreeable\r\nthoughts float in his mind during his summer nooning doze when he lies\r\non the grass after dinner waiting for the sun to strike the west side of\r\nthe farmhouse chimneys, which, standing square north and south, serve\r\nfor sun-dials. And in haymaking, when he is \"mowing away\" far above the\r\n\"purline beam\" in the barn as fast as a man in the hayrack can toss the\r\nhay up to him, and the air is heated like a furnace by the hot haymaking\r\nsun on the shingles close above his head, and his shirt is full of\r\ntimothy-seed, and he is almost dying with exhaustion, suddenly he hears\r\nthe sound of rain pattering on the roof. The hay in the meadow will be\r\nspoiled, but down he slides to enjoy an hour's rest in the cool lower\r\nworld of the barn-floor. And when the Fourth of July comes, and the\r\nfarm-boys gather at The Corners and fire off old shot-guns, pistols, an\r\nanvil, a cannon and empty thread-spools, then and there is the poetry of\r\nthe whole harvest-season for the boy. The harvest-moon, bringer of hot\r\ndays and \"bammy\" nights to glaze the corn, may be the admiration of\r\nmany, but is not so to the boy. It is accompanied by a special grievance\r\nto him: at the end of days' works that take the tuck out of him to the\r\nlast fragment he has to go for the cows, and to come home late after\r\neverybody else has washed up and is partly through supper. The hunter's\r\nmoon too, large, mild and beaming though it may be, is a thing of\r\ndisgust to the boy, for it marks the beginning of the season when, after\r\nchores are finished and the men are sitting comfortably around the\r\nkitchen fire, he has to split kindlings in the woodhouse for the hired\r\ngirl, and to fill the four wood-boxes with which the hill farmhouse\r\nwarms its kitchen, dining-room, nursery and parlor.\r\n\r\nThe hill-farmer's mind is rich in suggestions of work for a boy. After\r\nhaying, harvesting and everything else is done, you will find that lad\r\ndown cellar of a dark morning by the light of a tallow candle cutting\r\nbushels and bushels of potatoes for the cows with a \"slice\"--one of\r\nthose antique long iron shovels used about a brick-oven. You will find\r\nhim foddering forty head of cattle before school-time in the morning,\r\nrising at four o'clock for the purpose, and going over the work again\r\nafter school; and if he does not ride to the woods on Saturdays with the\r\nchoppers, the farmer calls him \"dreadful slack.\" The boy would like to\r\nget the work all finished some time, but on a hill-farm there is no hope\r\nof being done save the hope of being done with it entirely. There is\r\nalways plenty of work for the boy. In the vast, dark, lofty,\r\ncathedral-like orchard, whose untrimmed, mossy trees bear profusely on\r\ntheir interlacing branches the small fair apples for countless barrels\r\nof cider, there is work for him. There is plenty of work at the\r\ncider-mill or in boiling down the sweet cider over the bonfire that\r\ncheers the damp fall weather.\r\n\r\nIn fact, his tasks are endless. Perhaps it is raining like suds. The sun\r\nfor several weeks has reminded the hired man of a drop of hair-oil on a\r\nbasin of water. The only weather-sign that occurs to any one is the old\r\nIndian one: \"Cloudy all around, and pouring down in the middle.\" You\r\nmight suppose no work could be done in such weather. It is then the\r\nfarmer starts the boy off with five hundred dollars in his pocket to pay\r\nvarious husbandmen for cattle, and with directions to make a detour on\r\nhis way back collecting moneys due for other cattle, stopping at the\r\nChittaninny Tavern to meet a man who will have a sum of cash ready for\r\nhim there. The Chittaninny Tavern is in a cutthroat neighborhood. The\r\nman with the cash pays it at the bar in the presence of a crowd of\r\nruffians, the bartender looking over the boy's shoulder, and a loafer\r\nfollows him out to his horse, shows him a pistol and asks him if he\r\nhasn't \"one of them things.\" While the boy dashes homeward through the\r\nrain and night, pursued in imagination by the man with the pistol, he\r\nmakes up his mind that a well-lighted city is the place for him to do\r\nbusiness in.\r\n\r\nShould the rain lessen, the farmer and the boy set out for town with a\r\nherd of cattle. Having disposed of the herd, on their homeward way,\r\ntoward nightfall, the boy, who has walked, as near as he can guess, four\r\nhundred miles around the cattle in the November mud, is dismayed to see\r\nthe farmer stop at a house by the wayside. There are more cattle to be\r\nbought and driven home. The master of the wayside house is in some\r\nremote pasture, whither the boy runs to fetch him. After a long bargain\r\nwith this man the farmer pulls out a roll of bills, pays down a round\r\nsum, a fresh creature is brought out to the road, and again they pursue\r\ntheir homeward way. It is a young heifer this time--most difficult of\r\nanimals to drive. She runs like a deer: in a minute she is far ahead of\r\nthe boy. She takes the wrong road: the boy makes frightful efforts to\r\novertake her--enters the fields to follow her unseen, and cuts across\r\nlots to head her off. She, being a bright creature, is aware of his\r\nmanoeuvres. She watches him over the fences, and contrives to keep\r\nbeyond his reach, spite of all he can do. To hold her on the homeward\r\nroute is a miracle: still, the trio of farmer, boy and heifer do manage\r\nto reach the home village, where the farmer, who is riding in his\r\ncarriage, stops at the bank and tells the boy to be \"boss and all hands\"\r\nand go on alone with the heifer. This is terrible. Night is at hand, the\r\ndemoniac beast is wilder than ever, and the boy knows that, though\r\npalpitating with fatigue through all his frame, there are the chores at\r\nhome yet for him to do. Well, it is then he determines to go on a\r\nwhaling-voyage or to go and be a stoker for a steam-engine, or a\r\nboiler-maker, or a tramp, or anything but a boy on a farm; and so hope\r\ngrows strong in his heart.\r\n\r\nAn old hill-farmer must be beloved of Hermes, he so understands the arts\r\nof gain. If he wants to buy anything, he takes a sap-bucketful of eggs\r\nto the village, and makes a point of bringing back a part of the money.\r\nWhen in town he does not dine at a tavern, but on some crackers and\r\ncheese: he says baker's bread tastes like wasps' nests, and city fare in\r\ngeneral is light and dry. He saves more picking up horseshoes when the\r\nsnow melts than many persons do in all their lives. He works all the\r\nyear round: he thrashes in midwinter with the thermometer below zero.\r\nThe hard times affect him no more than a fly would a rhinoceros. This is\r\nperfectly exasperating to the poor spendthrift, good-for-nothing, lazy\r\npart of the community. The tramp hired man is particularly mad about it;\r\nhe declares the old farmer wants him to work all day for a sheep's head\r\nand pluck, and sleep under a cart at night. The tramp hired man\r\nentertains inverted financial ideas, and a creed that would probably\r\nread, \"Strike a man on his right cheek, and if he don't turn his left,\r\nboot him;\" and the tramp hired man lies _en grand_--tells lies two days\r\nlong when he finds a listener.\r\n\r\nThe old hill-farmer never wastes nor wears out things. He has a coat for\r\nbutchering-days that belonged to his great-great-grandfather who fought\r\nin the Revolution, and he has an ancient tin lantern that he considers\r\nvaluable. He almost quarrels with the young farmer about his corrugated\r\nglass lantern and his large, brilliant, one-paned lantern with the\r\npolished concave tin back, and his brass-mounted globe lantern: they\r\nhave resplendent lanterns on the hills. The old farmer says they will\r\nblow up or smash up, whereas his ancient tin lantern is safe. The old\r\nman does not see the boy shinning up a post in the horse-barn (there is\r\nno staircase--nothing but a few pegs stuck over the horses' heads by\r\nwhich to climb to the hay), the tin lantern swinging on his arm, its\r\ndoor open and candle flaring. Nor does he see the boy attempt to\r\nincrease the lantern's light by filling it with dry leaves. \"What has\r\nthat darned Irishman been up to now?\" says the old farmer, finding it\r\nunsoldered on its shelf.\r\n\r\n\"The mill-streams that turn the clappers of the world arise in solitary\r\nplaces.\" The old hill-farmers are lovers of their country. Their\r\ncarefully-saved money and their patriotism sustained our great war.\r\nWhoever was a boy on a hill-farm during the war remembers the neighbors\r\nstumbling over the stony roads at twilight, when the day's work was\r\ndone, to hear the daily paper read at the farmhouse on The Corners,\r\neager to know the worst or the best every night. Hugh used to hold the\r\ncandle, while Mark read in a slow, understanding voice about the\r\nmarching, fighting, wavering, conquering of those days, now less\r\nremembered than the _Iliad_, when we warmed our hearts at the blaze of\r\nwar. At every new local name, \"Stop!\" the old farmer used to say: \"let's\r\nsee where that is. Get the map.--Hugh, hold the light.--There 'tis, by\r\nthat grease-spot--not the tallow-spot Hugh just dropped--the spot where\r\npeople have put their fingers around Washington.\" Such a prodigious\r\ntrampling of fingers on the map followed our armies to battle! What a\r\nmemory it is to have in the mind!\r\n\r\nThe old farmer of the hills, however frugal, fosters some luxuries: one\r\nis horses. He has plenty of them, fat and slow from careful usage, and\r\nfor the most part spotless bays.\r\n\r\n    Four white feet and a white nose,\r\n    Skin him and give his body to the crows,\r\n\r\nsays the man of the hills. Melvine, a great horse-breeder, one day took\r\nsides in a quarrel between a horse and its master, fought the man for\r\nabusing his horse--fought him hard and long: 'twas \"t'other and which\"\r\nwith them for a while. \"I wouldn't have done it,\" said his neighbor,\r\nSquire Greffern: \"I wouldn't have fought the man. I'd have reasoned with\r\nhim kindly. I'd have said, 'See here, now, this horse isn't to blame: he\r\nain't human,' says I, 'and you ought not to abuse him,' says I. And says\r\nI, 'You ought to know better than to hurt a horse: it injures him,' says\r\nI. 'He has more sense than you have' (getting excited). 'You deserve to\r\nbe licked yourself, by hoky! Why, Gosh Almighty! get out, or I'll thrash\r\nthe daylights out of your darned rotten hide!'\" So ended the squire's\r\nreproof.\r\n\r\nThe old hill-farmer has an old dog grown from indulgence, like his\r\nhorses, in the habit of going his own gait. He _will_ trot to church on\r\nSundays, and trot, trot, down the aisle after meeting has begun, or, if\r\nhe likes, up into the gallery. When two of these obstinate old dogs once\r\nmet before the pulpit they indulged in a whirlwind of fight. The\r\nminister requested the sexton to put them out, but they showed him their\r\nteeth and fought until satisfied. Then the minister administered a grave\r\nrebuke to the farmers for desecrating the house of God by bringing dogs\r\nto church. Whether the dogs understood it or not, one of them never went\r\nto church again.\r\n\r\nAnother luxury of the hill-farmer is unabridged hospitality. He would\r\nagree with Doctor Johnson that nothing promotes happiness so much as\r\nconversation. Blazing fires--beacons of company--often flame up his\r\nbest rooms' chimney-stacks, pouring their blue wood-smoke high in the\r\nclear air of the hills. Thanksgiving Day in the hills would do for a\r\nfestival in honor of Jupiter, the patron of friendship, 'tis a day of\r\nsuch hospitality. It is the only day of the year when the boy has enough\r\nto eat. Not that there is not plenty all the year round. It is always\r\n_jam_ and never _satis_ with the boy, to borrow Tom Hood's joke. In\r\nkilling-time they put down hecatombs of beef in snow and of ham and\r\nsausage in hot lard, and they have stores of cod-fish to be cooked with\r\ncream, and of chickens for potpies, which are never made properly, for\r\nsome mysterious reason, save by a farmer's wife. A fearful fate, though,\r\nhas been known to befall a farmhouse among the wintry hills when the\r\nfarmer's wife has put too much sage in the sausage. Too much sage all\r\nwinter, ah! Nothing short of being \"clyed,\" as the farmer's wife\r\npronounces it, will satisfy a boy who works on the hills; and that he is\r\non Thanksgiving. 'Tis a day of perfect bliss to him, when he sleeps\r\nlong, and after his morning's work is done goes to skate in his best\r\nclothes on a very glary pond where a crowd of other boys are skating. He\r\nskates until he is tired and hungry, and comes home late, stopping on\r\nthe way to climb the fences of the orchards in search of frozen apples,\r\ndelicious food to his famished lips. When he reaches home the turkey\r\nsmells away out to the gate, and in the kitchen everything is all\r\ncluttered up and \"t'other end to,\" and dinner is nowhere near ready yet.\r\n'Tis a joyous hour for the boy when it is ready, and for the hired man\r\ntoo. The hired man's pleasure is somewhat damped by hearing the hired\r\ngirl remark that his mouth is like a barn-door with a load of hay in it.\r\n\"I declare for it if 'taint,\" says she. He informs her that she is\r\nalways \"bellerin'\" about something, and she requests him not to be so\r\n\"putchy;\" nor does that end the matter. Guests like the Melvines of\r\nMelvine Farm, the Bligh boys of Bligh's Corners, the Plunkett girls and\r\nDeacon Buckingham's hired girl, and Yem Finny and Sam Bab's folks, are\r\nthe kind to invite to a party. They are the kind to keep up a rumble of\r\ntalk in the parlor, and in the other rooms a rush of games--Hide the\r\nHandkerchief, Hunt the Slipper, and so on: Achilles's troops did not\r\nplay Whirl the Platter on the sands of Troy with a greater gusto.\r\n\r\nVery hospitable people are not particular as to who comes to see them,\r\nif only some one comes: therefore, pack-peddlers, stove-peddlers,\r\ndrovers, the old crazy man and the old crazy woman, and other wanderers,\r\nare welcome at the hill farmhouse. These vagabonds come from all\r\ndirections--up the Red Mill road, down from Windy Row, over from the\r\nHuddle and the Hollow, and across from Ranger's Field Centre, sometimes\r\nmeeting two or three together. The boy is glad to see them, particularly\r\nthe peddlers, they bring such an uproar of talk with them. The brown\r\nBohemian or Hungarian receives a bombardment of questions at the\r\nfarmhouse that breaks all bounds to his loquacity: he tells everything\r\nhe knows of foreign lands, as well as news of what is going on in ten\r\ncounties round. Two only of the vagrant tribe the boy dislikes, the\r\ncolporteur and the travelling Spiritualist--two cold, shabby, sniffling\r\nbeings, each wrapped in a shawl and each driving an old horse afflicted\r\nwith poll-evil. Whenever the boy goes to put up one of these men's\r\nhorses he wants to break his wagon and whip, and he does give them a few\r\nferocious shakes in the solitude of the stable. The boy worships the\r\nclockmaker, who comes once a year on a Saturday and stays over Sunday,\r\nmending all the clocks in the house, the tall, timeworn wooden one up in\r\nthe boy's bedroom as well as the rest. This fellow has a taste for\r\npugilism. While working at the clocks he holds discussions with the\r\nhired folks about Heenan, Sayers, Morrissey, dogs, cocks and horses, and\r\nlets out secrets about mills coming off in London and New York next\r\nweek. This is delightful. But once let the horse-pitchfork man arrive,\r\nand there is a regular sitting up at night, a grand debauch of talk on\r\npolitics, patent-rights, improved agricultural implements and other\r\nthemes, the whole interspersed with original jokes. The old farmer is\r\nobtuse about jokes--\r\n\r\n    An owl might make him laugh, if only it would wink,\r\n\r\nbut nothing less could--yet the horse-pitchfork man's jokes penetrate\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe boy thinks it dull when there is no company at the farmhouse of a\r\nwinter evening. He then sets a pitcher of cider to warm by the fire, and\r\nmakes himself as comfortable as he can over a book. The few books he\r\nreads are fastened minutely in his memory. He obtains _The Perfect\r\nGentleman_ from the district school library, and thenceforth knows what\r\nis proper behavior for an Englishman under all circumstances. He reads\r\n_The Vestiges of Creation_, and in afterlife is amazed to find half the\r\nworld fighting the ancient theory of evolution. His love of society\r\ncauses him to plunge into the vortex of the mite society and singing\r\nschool if he has anything decent to wear. Cheerfully he works in\r\npantaloons whose legs have been cut off and turned hind side before, in\r\norder that the thin and faded places may come on the back of his legs\r\nand the unfaded ones on his knees; contentedly he sustains them by one\r\nsuspender twisted from a solitary button in front around to another on\r\nhis right side: he knows the farmer's wife has no time to take care of\r\nhis clothes. But when old Mrs. Lyburn, a woman who can no more design a\r\nsuit of clothes than a theatre-ceiling fresco, is commissioned to make\r\nhim a coat out of an old goose-green overcoat, and a pair of trousers\r\nout of some thick, old light cloth breeches, and when she cuts the legs\r\nof those breeches off at top and bottom, leaving them broad enough for a\r\nTurk, with pockets like large bags hanging down inside of them, then the\r\nboy rebels and refuses to go anywhere. If he goes he takes his road\r\nthrough Stone's Woods, and comes home the back way by the wagon-house.\r\nThe boy has grit, real grindstone grit: therefore he keeps this up, and\r\nsooner or later he has it out with the old farmer about his clothes.\r\n\"Well, well, don't rare and pitch like a flax-break: we'll see about\r\nit,\" says the old gentleman. The old farmer takes the boy to town and\r\nbuys him a sleek, shiny black suit--the coat is a long-waisted,\r\nlong-tailed frock--and he adds a pair of good \"stubbid\" shoes, having\r\nstrings made of leather.\r\n\r\n\"You're stuck, and stuck bad,\" says the hired man compassionately when\r\nhe sees the suit. A boy who is as keen as a brier and smart as a whip\r\ncannot be expected to wear \"humbly\" clothes forever. A neat suit made by\r\nthe village tailor, and a necktie, hat and boots that put him into\r\npositively ethereal spirits, are articles that he finally attains. In\r\nthese clothes he joins the debating society and the choir. Saul Lapham,\r\na friend of his, plays the cornet at the choir-rehearsals. Saul lays\r\ndown the dignity of a human being to puff out his cheeks, bulge his eyes\r\nand grow red in the face blowing a brass horn. Saul is a tyro in the\r\nbusiness--can't blow softly, though he tries hard to do so, and\r\ncompletely drowns the singers except when he breaks down, which occurs\r\nrather often, to their extreme relief. The little spats and sensations\r\nof the choir-rehearsals are entertainment for the sylvan boy. One\r\nevening Miss Tway was so \"worked up\" about failing in a solo she was\r\ntrying to sing that she fainted twice, the first time with her mouth\r\nshut, the second time with it open; and Saul, not knowing what else to\r\ndo, put a gum-drop into it, which offended Miss Tway, for she thought it\r\nwas his finger.\r\n\r\nThe lad is a gallant figure in his new suit galloping on horseback from\r\nhis highlands down to the village on the flats to attend some rustic\r\ndiversion. In the tavern ballroom there is a little stage with a curtain\r\nhung across it, and on that stage the boy sees the most charming\r\nperformance he ever beholds. It consists of a regular play, with a\r\nballet between the acts, and a minstrel performance introducing the\r\ncelebrated scene of a negro teaching another negro to tune the banjo,\r\nwhere the pupil climbs up the back of his chair while endeavoring to\r\nascend the scale; and all ending with a puppet-show, the whole being\r\ndone by three young fellows. \"Why-ee! 'twas wonderful!\" says the boy.\r\n\r\nBalzac remarks: \"People who are very happy are naturally stupid.\"\r\nPerhaps it is because he is not stupid that the boy is unhappy on the\r\nmany-fountained hills. The longed-for evening soon appears--his last on\r\nthe farm. He sleeps no moment that night in his soft farmhouse bed under\r\nhomemade blankets hemmed with woollen thread. He does not know that he\r\nwill be homesick for his old bedroom--homesick for the Gothic chest, the\r\npicture from _The Pirate and Three Cutters_, and the toilet-table\r\nholding nothing but a hairbrush, which, with its half dozen bristles,\r\nresembles a Captain Cook club. He will be homesick for the very closet\r\nunder the roof that makes his clothes smell of hops, wool and dried\r\napples. How glows the morn when he leaves! He goes to success, for he\r\ncarries power--power as great as Fate.\r\n\r\n     MARY DEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VISION OF THE TARN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Alone, in contemplation lost,\r\n      I stood upon a castled height,\r\n    Dark-beetling o'er a lurid tarn\r\n      That glassed the brow of night.\r\n\r\n    Between the icy flash of stars,\r\n      Above me sprinkled and beneath,\r\n    The silence of the listening air\r\n      Was counterfeit of death.\r\n\r\n    No cloud upon the naked sky,\r\n      No ripple on the lake below;\r\n    But o'er the sluggish waters hung\r\n      A phosphorescent glow,\r\n\r\n    That suddenly, all quivering wan,\r\n      As smitten with the throes of birth,\r\n    Upheaving, vanished, to reveal\r\n      A phantom not of earth--\r\n\r\n    A lily wonderful as light,\r\n      Unfolded on the balmy deep,\r\n    And, cradled in its bosom, lay\r\n      A presence lost in sleep.\r\n\r\n    And tenderly a star remote\r\n      Shed holy lustre o'er the place\r\n    Where innocence and peace displayed\r\n      Such unimagined grace\r\n\r\n    That e'en the calm celestial orb,\r\n      Enamored of the dream below,\r\n    With tremulous emotion pale\r\n      Diffused a milder glow.\r\n\r\n    And I beheld, in mystery,\r\n      The secret of my vision fair--\r\n    That of a relic sprung the flower\r\n      That bore its image there.\r\n\r\n    And from the watchful star above--\r\n      The dwelling of a spirit fled--\r\n    That faithful sentinel of love\r\n      Its vacant shrine surveyed,\r\n\r\n    And knew, through all transition seen,\r\n      Its place and habitation dear,\r\n    Still waiting, in the throb of hope,\r\n      Its resurrection here.\r\n\r\n    Long had I gazed; but, lo! a cloud,\r\n      Down-sweeping as a bird of night,\r\n    O'erwhelmed me, and the phantasy\r\n      Was blotted from my sight.\r\n\r\n     JOHN B. TABB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH WINDING WAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIt was the tenth of November when my accident happened: it was late in\r\nFebruary before I again sat up and began to feel once more that I\r\nbelonged to the world of flesh and blood, and to take in slowly, with\r\nunaccustomed mind and ear, sights and sounds outside the monotonous\r\nworld of pain where I had lived so long that I felt bitterly I had\r\nearned the right to die. Few glimpses of light had enlivened the\r\nterrible blackness of my cruel experience: they had all come from my\r\nmother's smile. Occasionally, for a few moments when I lay with my head\r\nupon her breast, I was reinspired with a desire to live; but at most\r\ntimes a settled sense of suffering and gloom cut me off from every sweet\r\nsource of comfort in life. But after I had sat up once--once parted with\r\nthe dreary prospect of the chintz and lace which curtained my bed--I was\r\na little stronger. Deep was the silence of the icebound shore that day,\r\nsparkling the blue waters across which the sun marked a glittering\r\ntrack. My mother sat beside me, and Helen knelt by my reclining-chair\r\nwatching my face with eager, earnest eyes, divining every wish and\r\nforeseeing all my needs. She served me with such an enthusiasm of\r\ndevotion that in my morbid state, with every nerve strained to its\r\nhighest tension, I suffered merely in looking at her. But Dr. Sharpe\r\nhimself had begged me to let her stay with me, because she fretted so\r\nwhen away from me. I had but one wish in life, it seemed to me--to get\r\nback to Belfield. The luxury with which I was surrounded was an\r\noppression to my every sense. I was fed from priceless porcelain, and\r\nthe markets were ransacked to find dainties for my taste; my room was\r\nfreshly decorated every day with flowers, both cut and growing in pots,\r\nand the air was heavy with their scents; forced fruits from the\r\ngreenhouses, heaped in silver baskets on every table toward which I\r\nturned, tempted my dull appetite. I wanted my old room at home: I wanted\r\nto lie in my hard narrow bed and see the walls flush with the reflection\r\nof the dawn in the east--to have Carlo lift the latch of my door, and\r\nenter stealthily and stand at my bedside, wagging his tail and looking\r\nup at me with his solemn brown eyes as he waited for me to stretch out\r\nmy hand, that he might lick it all over for his good-morning. There, in\r\nthose dear familiar places, I should be able to think over the evil that\r\nhad come upon me--might perhaps, out of all my broken threads, regather\r\none or two.\r\n\r\nFor from the first I had been told the trials I was to confront. My life\r\nhad been saved, although it was at first despaired of, but I must be\r\npermanently lame. It had been a most unlucky fall for me, but a glorious\r\ncase for the surgeons--fractures and compound fractures, broken ribs and\r\ndislocated shoulders. In old times, when I had planned out my future, I\r\nhad said that I would be a surgeon when I grew up; but now, although all\r\nmy doctors--and my experience of doctors had come to be as wide as most\r\npeople's--had been most patient, tender and untiring in their study and\r\ntreatment of my case, I resigned without one murmur my wish to enter the\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nOne morning, while I was still absolutely helpless, a fierce gleam of\r\nlight reflected up from the sea shot athwart my face. Helen sprang up\r\nand carefully adjusted shades and curtains.\r\n\r\n\"You are a kind little nurse, Helen,\" said I. \"What does the new\r\ngoverness think of the way you spend your time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mademoiselle Lenoir quite enjoys it,\" returned my mother, laughing:\r\n\"she sits about reading novels and eating bonbons. I will go and see\r\nwhat she is doing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do, mother,\" said I, \"and take a walk in the greenhouses\r\nyourself.--Helen, you'll take good care of me, won't you?\"\r\n\r\nShe flung her arm about my neck and pressed her quivering lips against\r\nmy hair.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could do something for you,\" she cried plaintively.\r\n\r\n\"But you do a great deal, Helen. Of course my mother does everything\r\nbest of any one, but you come next.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave me a piteous little smile. \"I wish I could do something better\r\nthan any one else,\" she whispered: \"it was all my fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, dear little girl, I shall send you away if you say that any more.\r\nNothing was your fault--nothing. Don't take up that weary strain again.\r\nI want you to tell me all about that morning, though: I never heard yet\r\nhow you came to be on the cliff at all. Your grandfather had forbidden\r\nyou to go there.\"\r\n\r\nHer lips still quivered. \"I am afraid I shall cry,\" she said with a\r\nlittle gasp.\r\n\r\n\"You must not cry: it does me harm to see anybody cry,\" I answered\r\nimperiously. \"Now tell me about it all.\"\r\n\r\nShe regained her self-command at once: \"Georgy asked me about the cliff,\r\nand I told her that grandpa said I was never to go there--never. But she\r\ntook me by the arm and pulled me: she pulled me hard--she is stronger\r\nthan I am,\" said the poor little mite. It was not difficult to guess the\r\nremainder of the story from the child's disjointed words: she struggled\r\nnot to blame her cousin. Georgy, on reaching the brow of the precipice,\r\nhad amused herself by throwing stones down the ravine, that she might\r\nenjoy their rumble and clatter. When this too mild pleasure shortly\r\npalled upon her, she tried to induce Beppo, the delicate Italian\r\ngreyhound, to go down, and finally, vexed with him for not seeking such\r\na form of suicide, she flung him over--half in sport perhaps, for\r\nGeorgy's pastimes were sometimes rather savage. He regained his footing\r\nbefore he was swallowed up in the abyss, and stood on the little shelf\r\nof rock thirty feet below, whining at first in entreaty, then howling in\r\nsuch abject terror that Helen, broken-hearted at such misery, slid\r\nfearlessly after him, but found herself unable to retrace her steps.\r\n\r\n\"Did not Georgy try to help you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think she did,\" answered Helen, fixing her great eyes upon me.\r\n\"She kept calling to me at first not to be a coward and to come back.\r\nThen she ran away, and I did not see her any more until--\"\r\n\r\n\"How many times did you call me?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I seemed to know you would come, but I felt afraid I\r\ncould not hold on any longer. Just when I was tired out I heard you\r\ncoming.\"\r\n\r\nI had some stirrings of curiosity about my own fate.\r\n\r\n\"Did you send the people after me?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I saw you going down,\" said she, growing pale even to her lips, \"I\r\ncould not move at first. I was not sure what I ought to do. Then I\r\nremembered, and ran as fast as I could to papa. I forget what came\r\nafterward. I remember that grandpa was holding me in his arms and crying\r\nvery much, and that papa and Mills and all the men were bringing you\r\nacross the lawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me any more,\" said I quickly: \"I can't quite bear it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was late in April when I finally went back to Belfield, and even by\r\nthat time I was so far from possessing strength or health that not only\r\nMr. Floyd accompanied me, but Dr. Sharpe and Mills as well. Jack Holt\r\nand Harry Dart and Tony Thorpe came about me at once: all the good\r\npeople of Belfield thronged to bring me something--words of comfort and\r\ncheer, jellies, Easter lilies, cakes and oranges--but the one I had most\r\nlonged to see did not come. Once more at home, I grew stronger both in\r\nbody and mind: the spring-time did me good, although welling up within\r\nme all the time, so imperiously, so irresistibly, that I never entirely\r\nlost the pain, was the thought that never before had I failed to watch\r\nthe first uncoilings of the fern-fronds beneath the dead leaves of the\r\nformer year; the willow catkins, the fragrant arbutus, all the signs of\r\ninspiration from the earliest breaths of spring in the hedges and\r\nmeadows and woods about Belfield. But still, as I lay on my sofa and\r\ntried four times a day the great feat of crossing our parlor from wall\r\nto wall, I could guess all the beautiful things that were going on out\r\nof doors, and I was happier for the coming summer-time, for is any state\r\nso sombre, any grief so unquenchable, any burden of despondency so\r\noppressive, but that the divine gladness of the awakening earth stirs it\r\nwith its revivifying breath? My misfortune did not inspire me with\r\nmystical, heavenly resignation, but I began to be able to look its\r\nresults in the face.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing so hampers us in life as the failure to accept our fate with\r\ncourage,\" my guardian said to me once. \"Be as brave as you can. Do you\r\nremember what Medea says in reply to that cruel reminder of her\r\nlosses?--'Husband, countrymen, riches, all gone from you: what remains?'\r\nShe answers, 'Medea remains.'\"\r\n\r\nIt had become evident to me, without interrogations on my part, that my\r\nmother and Mr. Floyd had resigned at least all present hopes of\r\nmarriage. All their thoughts seemed to be centred in me, and I felt\r\nmyself a hinderance in their plans of happiness. So, while I was still\r\nholding my guardian's hand, I reminded him of our talk on the bluff that\r\nfar-off November morning.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I would take your mother from you too, my dear boy?\" said\r\nhe bluntly. \"Do you think she would come to me if I wanted to take her?\"\r\n\r\n\"But it seems too much of a sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get well, then, at once,\" Mr. Floyd exclaimed, laughing. \"As soon as\r\nyou can walk up the church-aisle all the Belfield wedding-bells shall\r\nring their loudest.\"\r\n\r\nJack Holt brought me some white roses one day in June, which I knew\r\ncould never have grown anywhere in Belfield except against the eaves of\r\na certain Gothic cottage. I asked him if Georgy sent them, and why she\r\nnever came to see me.\r\n\r\n\"I have wondered too why she never comes,\" he returned; \"and I have\r\nasked her, but she tells me her mother bids her stay away from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Georgy was not used to be so obedient,\" said I. \"Ask her to come. I\r\nsuppose she thinks I am frightful to behold, but I fancy I'm much the\r\nsame, unless I begin to look like a girl. I'm getting into the habit of\r\ndoing everything so languidly, so effeminately, Jack, that I wonder\r\nsometimes if there is any masculine vigor left in me. What can I do to\r\ntry? I can never run any more: it will be a long time before I can pull\r\nmy old stroke with an oar. I might shoot at a mark, and if you and Harry\r\nwill come I will hobble out and try to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Floyd,\" began Jack with some hesitation, \"from Georgy's reluctance to\r\nsee you I have sometimes thought she was concerned in the matter of your\r\naccident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least,\" I cried stoutly: \"never believe that for a moment.\r\nIt was my own affair entirely, and to this day I can't quite decide that\r\nI was not both clumsy and stupid not in some way to keep myself from\r\nfalling.\"\r\n\r\nI was sitting alone that evening, toward the late sunset, when Georgy\r\ncame. Showers had fallen all the afternoon, but now the clouds had risen\r\nfrom the west, and, although now and then a few drops fell, the east was\r\nspanned by a rainbow and the turbid masses of cloud above took on colors\r\nof crimson and purple. I heard the gate click, and turning I saw Georgy\r\nLenox coming in, attended by both Jack Holt and Harry Dart. Each held an\r\numbrella over her--Jack in earnest, and Harry in joking solicitude for\r\nher bright summer ribbons. It was evident enough that they were all in\r\nhigh spirits, and I seemed to hear the sparkling impertinences which\r\nissued from her laughing lips as she looked from one to the other of the\r\nboys with many a toss of her yellow curls and shrug of her round\r\nshoulders. They left her at the door, which stood wide open, and I\r\ncalled to her to come in. She entered, but waited a moment on the\r\nthreshold, growing a little pale as she looked at me. Then rallying,\r\n\"How do you do, Floyd?\" she exclaimed. \"You see that I have come at\r\nlast?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you,\" I returned. \"But come nearer: I want to shake\r\nhands with you.\"\r\n\r\nShe approached, and I clasped her hand, looking up into her face. She\r\nhad grown more womanly in these last seven months, and far more\r\nbeautiful; and, looking in her face, I at first forgot to speak.\r\n\r\n\"How queer you are!\" said she, pouting, but laughing. \"Why do you look\r\nat me so?\"\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I spoke or not, but she bent and kissed me, and\r\nthus answered my feverish longing, the gratification of which\r\noverpowered me with a sudden intoxication like that of wine.\r\n\r\n\"I only did it because you are ill,\" said she, putting her hands to her\r\nface and peeping out at me from between her fingers. \"You look so thin\r\nand changed, Floyd! I knew you would, and I dreaded to see you: I am\r\nafraid of sick people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am harmless enough. Am I very horrible?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are dreadfully white, and your eyes were not so large before you\r\nwere sick. Oh, how many times I have asked the boys how you were!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you never came, Georgy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am past sixteen now, and mamma will not let me go and see boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said I with an indefinable sigh, \"that you are almost a woman.\r\nAnd Jack is eighteen.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boys are so full of their examinations! Do you think Jack will\r\npass? He is such a stupid old dear! I always feel as if I knew the most,\r\nyet I know nothing--actually nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack will pass. Whatever place in the world he tries for will always be\r\nready and waiting for him. I am more anxious about Harry: he cares so\r\nlittle about his chances, and trusts always to inspiration and good\r\nluck.\"\r\n\r\nGeorgy looked at me somewhat curiously: \"Don't you feel badly, Floyd, to\r\nhave the boys go to college and leave you behind?\"\r\n\r\nWe three had planned years ago how we were to enter college together,\r\nyet no one of us had yet alluded to my disappointment, and it was\r\ndifficult for me to bear her question and answer it unflinchingly.\r\n\r\n\"This is one of my many hard things to bear, Georgy.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis dreadful for you,\" she exclaimed with energy. \"To think what you\r\nwere, Floyd, a tall, handsome, dandified fellow, and now changed all at\r\nonce into a hopeless cripple!\"\r\n\r\nI even found the strength to endure this and give no sign. In my darkest\r\nhours of dejection I had said these words to myself, but no one had\r\nhitherto uttered them within my hearing.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" she went on, \"what you will do? Shall you try to be a\r\ndoctor, Floyd?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Georgy: I have given up that idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does seem wretched. What does Mr. Floyd say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything that is most considerate. I have had a hard experience,\r\nGeorgy, but I have at last learned how tender and faithful many of my\r\nfriends are.\" I regarded her steadily, and she flushed crimson.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you think,\" she retorted, \"that I might have come to see you\r\noftener. But to tell you the truth, Floyd, I have been almost angry with\r\nyou, and so has mamma. Of course it was not your fault that you fell\r\ndown the cliff, and I almost felt as if I were to blame a little about\r\nit, although not nearly so much as that silly Helen. To think of her\r\ngoing after a miserable little dog! Oh, how I hated Mr. Raymond for what\r\nhe said to me! You cannot think how cruel he was, Floyd, when I went\r\nback to the house, after hiding away all the morning. The doctors were\r\nup stairs with you, and nobody knew if you were dead or alive. He laid\r\nall the blame on me--all of it--and kissed and petted Helen, and cried\r\nover her as if she had been brought back from the grave. And the\r\nhousekeeper went up and packed my things, and I was sent out of the\r\nhouse as if I were a murderer or thief, or something dreadful. Mr. Floyd\r\ncame home with me: he came after your mother. He was in a dreadful state\r\nof mind, and scarcely spoke all the way, except once to tell me that I\r\nwas very young, and that I must pray to God to give me a heart. Just as\r\nif I were not crying and sobbing all the time! Then, when mamma saw me\r\nand I had to tell her all about it, she burst out angrily against me,\r\ntelling me that I had lost all my chances of having any of Uncle\r\nRaymond's money. I had not thought of that before, and it did seem worse\r\nthan anything else. Do you wonder I have felt half angry with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You teach me to wonder at nothing, Georgy. You must forgive me for\r\ninjuring your chances of inheriting Mr. Raymond's money;\" and I laughed\r\nwith some bitterness. \"But take heart,\" I went on: \"little Helen loves\r\nyou, and told me to tell you she was sure you meant no harm, and that\r\nshe was sorry you were sent away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Little proud, stuck-up thing!\" exclaimed Georgy. \"It makes me so angry\r\nto think of that child's having everything under her orders--all the\r\nservants down on their knees before her, with 'Miss Floyd' this and\r\n'Miss Floyd' that! And then how ridiculously both her father and Uncle\r\nRaymond worship her!\"\r\n\r\n\"She was very generous to you, Georgy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should she not be? There is no reason why, instead of putting\r\nup with a few rings and chains and dresses, I should not have half of\r\neverything at The Headlands. I am older than she is, and need things\r\nmore, and I am prettier than she is: don't you think me prettier,\r\nFloyd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think you are,\" I rejoined quietly. \"But everybody says Helen\r\nwill grow up to be very beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" observed Georgy tartly. \"She is too pale, and her\r\neyes are too big: then she is such a solemn little thing. Don't you like\r\ngolden hair best, Floyd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And blue eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know. But yes, I do,\" I added, meeting hers.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think that Helen will grow up to be beautiful?\" she\r\npleaded after her momentary triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I certainly do,\" I answered stubbornly.\r\n\r\n\"We shall see,\" she exclaimed, tossing her head.\r\n\r\n\"Don't think,\" said I, \"that I believe that she will be more beautiful\r\nthan you, Georgy. I don't imagine any girl could be that, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what else?\" she asked, smiling and dimpling.\r\n\r\n\"But think of something besides beauty,\" I ventured humbly. \"'Tis so\r\npoor a preparation for a woman's life, Georgy, to care merely for\r\noutside loveliness. I want you to pray for a sweet, loving, grateful\r\nnature, Georgy--not to nurse bad, revengeful thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at me in profound surprise, then burst out laughing. \"I\r\ndidn't know you had grown pious,\" she observed with a shrug; and, seeing\r\nthe fruits and confectionery piled on the table at my side, begged me to\r\noffer her some, and fell to eating them ravenously, despite the dignity\r\nof her sixteen years, and after devouring all she could, carried the\r\nrest of them away in her arms.\r\n\r\nI sat quietly thinking about her after I was left alone. I smiled to\r\nmyself at the thought of her coquettish parting glance, for I was sure\r\nshe would have kissed me again had I asked her; but I wanted no more of\r\nher kisses, although I had found them so sweet. I seemed to have\r\nsuddenly grown stronger and wiser where she was concerned; yet I suppose\r\nthe poor truth of the matter was, that she had stung my vanity keenly,\r\nand said little to endear herself to me in our recent interview. Her\r\nwords, instead of harming me, had roused all the resentment of the\r\nstrong vital force within me. I felt curiously stirred, almost elated,\r\nin remembering what she had said, and contrasting her prophecies of\r\nimpotence and failure with my growing sense of power. When the door-bell\r\nrang presently I myself hobbled across the floor on my crutches and\r\nopened it.\r\n\r\nJack Holt stood there. \"Why, 'tis not really you, Floyd?\" he exclaimed\r\nin surprise; and taking away one of my crutches, he himself supported\r\nme back to my chair. \"I was afraid to come in,\" he went on, sitting down\r\nby my side, \"lest you should already be over-tired; but if you are well\r\nenough to see me I have something to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am better to-night. In fact, all at once I feel that I am not\r\nalways going to be the good-for-nothing fellow I have been of late. I\r\nbegin to have a consciousness that somewhere within me life and energy\r\nare stirring again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad!\" said he with a voice of some constraint, and looked at\r\nme fixedly. \"Georgy was here,\" he observed presently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"She did you good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I returned with an effort at indifference: \"she may have\r\nroused me a little.\"\r\n\r\nHe started up, and began to pace the floor with a flurried air quite\r\nunusual with him, now and then stopping abruptly and seeming to bend all\r\nhis energies to the arrangement of a book or mantel-ornament, as if\r\ntheir displacement caused him annoyance--conduct so unlike his ordinary\r\nphlegmatic demeanor that I suspected him of extreme embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Speak out, old fellow!\" said I briefly. \"What's the use of all this\r\nhesitation?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned squarely round and faced me, yet did not meet my eyes, but\r\nlooked over and beyond me. I have never forgotten his face as I saw it\r\nthen: the heavy features were all fixed in sombre lines; his eyes were\r\nlike my dog Carlo's, full of honesty and patience, but I knew that he\r\nwas suffering.\r\n\r\n\"I am older than you, Floyd--\" he began.\r\n\r\nI assented: \"Yes, three years older.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old enough,\" he pursued, \"to have thought a good deal about the time\r\nwhen I shall be an independent man. As soon as I am through college I am\r\nto take the pistol- and rifle-factories off my father's hands. The\r\npapers are already made out, and will be signed on my twenty-first\r\nbirthday; so from that time I shall have an income which will entitle me\r\nto marry and settle as early as I please.\"\r\n\r\nI gazed at him in profound surprise.\r\n\r\n\"You are only fifteen,\" he went on. \"I dare say you have not thought of\r\nmarrying anybody yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No indeed!\" I burst out petulantly.\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" said he dropping his eyes. \"I am older, you know, and I have\r\nthought a good deal about it. It has seemed to me for a long time now\r\nthat but one thing could possibly happen--that I shall marry Georgy as\r\nsoon as I leave college. Her mother will let her marry no one but a man\r\nrich enough to make her life pleasant in the world: my secure prospects\r\nseem to justify my reliance on my chances of winning her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you liked her,\" I muttered hoarsely. His words and manner\r\noverwhelmed me with wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he went on, his dull voice gaining softer modulations, \"I love\r\nher with all my heart. You know I do: there can be no use in concealing\r\nit. I think of nothing for myself: 'tis all for her. She--\" He broke\r\noff, growing furiously red and shamefaced, then recovered his\r\nself-composure. \"But notwithstanding all this,\" said he with a sad,\r\npatient, steady face and voice, \"I have decided that I ought to give her\r\nup. It was my intention to have everything settled before I went to\r\ncollege, but this afternoon I made her tell me the truth about your\r\naccident: since then I feel that you have the first claim upon her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you mean.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled and shook his head. \"You have lost a great deal,\" he returned\r\nwith unwonted tenderness: \"you need much happiness, much private,\r\nindividual contentment, to enable you to bear the troubles that have\r\ncome upon you. Georgy was in a measure concerned in causing them: she\r\nought to make full atonement for all the harm she has done. Ever since\r\nyou came back I have felt that if I could do you any good I would cut\r\noff my right hand to serve you. At last I see a way. If you wish it,\r\nFloyd, the dearest wish of your heart may come to pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"The--dearest--wish--of--my--heart?\" I stuttered. \"I don't know what you\r\nmean.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed quietly. \"I suspect you know all about it,\" he said. \"You are\r\na quiet fellow, but I am not so blind as not to have found out that you\r\nare in love with Georgy. But in spite of that, I used to feel, although\r\nyou are handsomer than I, and a thousand times cleverer, that I had the\r\nfirst claim upon her. You are younger than she is; she will be a grown\r\nwoman while you are still a boy: in fact, there were plenty of reasons\r\nwhy I never hesitated to come before you. But now I feel bound in honor\r\nto tell you that I give her up--that--that you can--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked at me, believing he had said enough, but I was\r\nstupefied by my ignorance, shyness and doubt. \"Do you mean,\" I blurted\r\nout, \"that you will give up marrying her--that I can have her in your\r\nplace?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely what I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will do nothing of the sort,\" I cried roughly. \"Even if she cared\r\nfor me--which she does not--nothing could induce me to marry anybody,\r\nand least of all Georgy Lenox.\"\r\n\r\nFor she had wounded my pride and vanity to the quick, and even the kiss\r\nshe had given me seemed a very Judas kiss of falsehood and betrayal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the warm weather came we went to the mountains, and when we\r\nreturned in the autumn I had put aside one crutch, and felt at times\r\nthat I was soon to banish the other. The boys had gone to college, and\r\nBelfield was desolate to me. Georgy was visiting cousins in New York. I\r\nhad not seen her since that evening in June when she came to see me, nor\r\nwas I to see her again for years. In November my mother and I went to\r\nJamaica, for I had so outgrown my strength that fresh and alarming\r\nsymptoms seemed to threaten me with more fatal ills than being merely\r\ncrippled for life. But their only effect was to banish us for two years\r\nfrom all the familiar old scenes. We were never to go back to Belfield\r\nagain and find our home there. Youth and passionate emotion and the\r\nthought of marriage had vanished now from my mother: she had, it\r\nsometimes seemed to me, no other wish than that I should be restored to\r\nhealth. I fancy she almost hated the memory of that brief time when the\r\nwords of Mr. Floyd made her color deepen, her lip tremble and the glad\r\nimpulsive tears start to her eyes.\r\n\r\nI accepted her willing service and her exclusive love. I needed both,\r\nGod knows, in those days of weakness and pain. After a time I began to\r\nmend: then I grew robust and strong. My lameness diminished, and was\r\ncomparatively cured, since I could dispense with crutch or stick.\r\nWhether youth or the fine air of those beautiful tropical uplands\r\nwrought the miracle, who shall say? Now, although I have the old limp,\r\nwhich I shall carry with me to the grave, my misfortune has ceased to be\r\nsuch to me: it is hard to feel that I was ever justified in regarding it\r\nas a calamity to becloud my life. And my little daughter said to me the\r\nother day, \"I am so glad, papa, that you are lame, for I am sure to\r\ncatch you up, even if the boys run away from me.\"\r\n\r\nAll the more striking characteristics of my nature were changed by my\r\naccident. I had suffered much in body and in mind, and had been refined\r\nby the torture to a point which made me effeminate, since an almost\r\npainful capacity for sympathy, an overwhelming dread of inflicting\r\nsuffering, and a somewhat morbid self-depreciation are qualities\r\nscarcely masculine. My early ambition had been for a hard place in the\r\nworld, where the world's work would force me to give hard knocks before\r\nI reached success. But now I shrank from the jostle and bustle and harsh\r\ncompetitions of real life; and as both my mother and Mr. Floyd wished\r\nnothing so much as that I should be guarded from all effort and fatigue\r\nat this epoch, everything conspired to unfit me for an active career,\r\nand to make me a mere looker-on--not a worker, but a musing,\r\ndisappointed spectator.\r\n\r\nBut when I was about eighteen I returned and entered the junior year at\r\ncollege with Jack Holt and Harry Dart. I had felt some pride in keeping\r\nup with them, and had enjoyed the advantage in Jamaica of the society of\r\nan Oxford graduate who was coaching the two sons of a wealthy planter to\r\nfit them to enter an English university. I read with him, and was well\r\nable to pass my examination.\r\n\r\nWhat it was for me to resume my old familiar intercourse with Holt and\r\nDart I could never write down here. My two years in the tropics had not\r\nbeen joyless--indeed, considering all things, they had been singularly\r\nhappy years--still, I had felt like a child shut out from the sunshiny\r\nplace where his mates are playing. I had become patient, contemplative\r\nand resigned, and in study and in studious observation of Nature in her\r\nrarest beauty and most mighty and invincible development I had almost\r\nforgotten the deliciousness of a selfish and individual hope, the\r\npleasures of happy and careless youth.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I entered college I became sufficiently absorbed in the\r\nactual. Neither Holt nor Dart had changed in the slightest degree,\r\nexcept that Jack wore trim English whiskers and looked quite\r\nmiddle-aged, and Harry was engaged in nursing the incipient down of a\r\nmoustache, and was the tallest, handsomest, cleverest fellow in his\r\nclass. Jack had always been the closest of students, and his old\r\ndiligence had not abated here: he kept up with the rest by dint of solid\r\nhard work. Harry flung scholarship to the winds of course, but made a\r\nspecial career for himself which won him more admiration from everybody\r\nexcept the faculty than any amount of legitimate industry. He was a\r\nfluent and ready debater; he wrote for the college journal; his high\r\nanimal spirits brought everybody about him, and his mind seemed ever\r\neager and poised for flight: he was ready in wit; decried trifling\r\nsubjects, yet would dispute for two hours over an absurdity; was\r\ndexterous and unanswerable in his syllogisms; would advance the crudest\r\nand most untenable theory, defend it, reducing the arguments of his\r\nopponents to meaningless folly, conquer apparently by both wit and\r\nreason, then turn his own hypothesis inside out, confute it, dash it\r\ninto senseless atoms, and dismiss it as unworthy of a thought. In short,\r\namong us lads, busy with books and full of admiration of our own\r\ncleverness, he was delightful; and among other ostentatious pedantries\r\nsuch as prevail at college his passed unrebuked. When he tried his wits\r\nwith Mr. Floyd, that gentleman implored him for God's sake to hold his\r\ntongue and to consult Carlyle's _Sartor Resartus_, book 2, chapter 4,\r\nand discover the opinion of sensible men concerning youthful intellects\r\nlike his own.\r\n\r\nI appeared to poor enough advantage at first, and was almost afraid to\r\nspeak in the curious and motley society which thronged our rooms. The\r\nquick wit, the ready epigram and squib, the oppressive and multitudinous\r\npuns in every language,--all served to stun and confuse me, fixed as I\r\nwas in grave and quiet habits of mind and thought. It was amazing to me\r\nat first with what ease many of the boys had acquired clear ideas upon\r\nevery question of the day, and with what brilliancy they could advance\r\nthem, while I was tongue-tied from modesty or reserve. Presently,\r\nhowever, I discovered that these promising young gentlemen were not so\r\nwondrous wise after all. I dismissed my fears, felt less fastidious\r\nabout the emphatic utterance of a thoughtless opinion, and soon was as\r\nloud-tongued as any in my demand that the world should be made over at\r\nonce to suit men of our calibre. At first they were all very tender and\r\npatient with me, but when I grew a trifle bolder my little gravities\r\nbecame the target for everybody's wit, and I dare say I was much\r\nimproved by having my mannerisms and elegancies knocked rudely off from\r\nme.\r\n\r\nEvery boy is fortunate who carries the oldest and best associations of\r\nhis life into his university career; and Harry and I were supremely\r\nlucky in always having Jack Holt with us in the old way, and being able\r\nin a world of transient delusions and attractions of absorbing charm to\r\nfall back upon something real--an influence which could not be\r\noverturned by our eagerness for fashion and novelty, and which, if\r\nforgotten for a moment, reasserted itself with vital force to atone for\r\nsuch a base neglect. Not that Jack claimed anything from us: perhaps his\r\npower over us was commensurate with the modesty and dignity of his\r\ncharacter. His regard was a necessary note in the harmony of our\r\nwell-being: his disapprobation was a voice which cried \"Shame!\" to us,\r\nalthough he never uttered a reproach. I felt all this as well as Harry,\r\nbut he, of course, undisciplined and untrained, possessed more ardor and\r\na more decided temperament than I: his aberrations were wider; and, as\r\nthe pendulum must always swing back to the right as far as it bounded to\r\nthe left, he came in his repentance as much closer to his cousin than\r\ndid I as his deviations had exceeded mine. No wonder Jack loved him--not\r\nwith impetuosity, for Jack was never impetuous: all his feelings were\r\ndeep, calm, patient, tender, unconquerable by time or chance. The two\r\nfelt that mutual attraction which opposites and counterparts possess.\r\nHarry was the most popular man in his class. Nature had done everything\r\nfor him, and lavished those gifts of which she is usually most sparing.\r\nHe had a good mind and genial wit; a relish for every form of enjoyment;\r\na perfect form, the glorious beauty of a Greek god, with crisp golden\r\ncurls, brilliant deep-set eyes of blue, noble and chiselled features;\r\nfrank manners which none could resist; spirits which nothing could\r\ndepress; an impetuous temper, but passing like a flash the moment it was\r\nspent. Jack, on the other hand, had no beauty, and was regarded by those\r\nwhom he did not care for as a dull fellow. He was a little slow, and had\r\nslight appreciation of wit except to admire every evidence of it in\r\nHarry. He had certain settled objects in life, and spent none of his\r\nforces on the pleasant distractions which the rest of us sought on the\r\nway. He had been born with a sort of reposeful energy, which had always\r\nimpressed me with the conviction that no ordinary situation was enough\r\nfor him; and at college there was something disproportionate in his\r\nposition among light-hearted boys, so that I never wondered that he\r\nfound our aims trivial. He possessed to the full that force of character\r\nby which a man masters himself, always keeps himself in check, and in\r\ntimes of risk and extremity of peril can suffice unto his own needs and\r\ncourageously resist sorrow, misfortune and disappointment.\r\n\r\nBut while Harry, full of lawless and uncontrollable impulses, had a\r\nstormy and untried future before him, in which he was to be obliged to\r\nwork hard for all his successes, Jack's seemed a dazzling vista of\r\nprosperity and ease. He was already engaged to the girl he loved; he was\r\nthe only son of a man whose wealth was enormous; and while the rest of\r\nus were to be hungrily gazing into the world's windows with our cold\r\nhands in our empty pockets, he was calmly to take the prettiest girl we\r\nknew by the hand and lead her away into a fairyland whose glories we\r\nmight only guess at. But he took all his prospects very quietly: not\r\neven for the sake of love did he neglect his work. He rarely spoke of\r\nGeorgy, and I knew that it would never be his fault to illuminate with\r\ntoo bright a glare the sweet mysteries of the love that must lie between\r\nthem. I saw him sometimes writing to her with her picture before him.\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose he writes about?\" Harry used to ask me on such\r\noccasions. \"She cares little enough about fine sentiments, even if he\r\nwere given to that sort of thing; and I can't believe that he is very\r\nostentatious in declaring his passion. I don't think she will ever pass\r\nthat criticism upon his epistles that some old party did upon a pudding:\r\n'Too many plums and not enough suet.' I confess I cannot guess how he\r\ncontrives to fill his six regulation pages.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see that it concerns us, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true. But she would show me his letters if I asked her to. I\r\nwonder how Jack likes a certain ease she has in other men's society?\r\nWhat claws are to a cat, what the sting is to the bee, what its poison\r\nis to the upas tree, coquetry is to Georgy Lenox. I wish him joy of\r\nher, but wash my hands of the engagement.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with some heat, which was his wont in every allusion to Jack's\r\nlove-affair. But I knew that Harry had a dozen flirtations on hand, and\r\nthe fatalest effect of the false is its power of destroying our delicate\r\nand just perception of the true.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMy mother, on her return, had gone at once to her sister, Mrs. Woolsey\r\nof New York, and remained with her until she joined me for a Christmas\r\nvisit at Mr. Raymond's. Three years had passed since I was there, and\r\nthe three years had changed Helen from a mere child into a slim maiden\r\nof almost fourteen, tall and stately for her years. Mr. Raymond seemed\r\nno older and no feebler: his eyes held the old restless fire, the only\r\nreminiscence of youthful power about him; he was still anxiously served\r\nand tended, and in this cold season huddled before the fires covered\r\nwith furs, a tiger-skin over his knees, his pale hands clasping his\r\nwrappings together at the throat. He was considerate for my mother's\r\ncomfort, as a host should be, and he betrayed an eager curiosity and\r\ninterest concerning my infirmity; which showed his care for me, but\r\nwhich I resented as an intrusion. For I had reached the point when it\r\nwas easy for me to endure the fact that I was unlike other men in my\r\nphysical strength, but was not yet sufficiently resigned to it to bear\r\nquestioning or sympathy. Helen never alluded to it, and although at\r\nfirst she tried to save me footsteps, she had tact enough to give up\r\neven that evidence of any knowledge of my weakness. Indeed, she was shy\r\nof me now: she had a governess in these days, and had perhaps been\r\ntaught one of the first lessons that young girls learn--to shrink from\r\nevery man who is neither her father nor her brother nor her grandfather.\r\nAccordingly, during all that Christmas week I rarely heard the sound of\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd had joined us a few hours after we reached The Headlands. The\r\nthree years had made more change in him than in any of the rest of us,\r\nif I except myself. He had grown older--was more quiet and languid, and\r\nmore tender in his manner. I had often wondered of late, now that I was\r\nstrong again and in a measure launched into life, whether he and my\r\nmother would marry. I saw many meanings in my mother's beautiful face of\r\nwhich she never spoke to me; the two had long talks together every day,\r\nand their manner to each other held all the sweetness of steadfast\r\naffection and true sympathy; yet there was a nameless something which\r\nwas never in his tones now.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely, quiet Christmas-time. Outside, the winter seas roared\r\nand great masses of ice covered the rocks and bound the shore: heavy\r\nsnows fell and the winds whistled cold. But inside, everything went on\r\nin a still, blessed fashion that only comes when people love one\r\nanother, and in a stately, comfortable fashion that is only at command\r\nin rich houses where all stores of state and comfort are opened with a\r\ngolden key. The greenhouses were in their perfection now: there were\r\nmany of them of various temperatures, but all opening from one into the\r\nother. Mr. Floyd and I were walking one day where the oranges, lemons\r\nand cedrats were ripening in different degrees of maturity: they seemed\r\nto blossom and yield as freely as if in their native climates, and our\r\nfavorite walk was there these chilly winter afternoons; for Mr. Floyd,\r\nalways a shiverer, of late found every place except the tropical\r\natmosphere of a greenhouse too cold for him. My mother had been with us\r\npicking a few orange-blossoms. My guardian had taken one little spray\r\nand put it against her hair, sighing meanwhile, although he was smiling.\r\n\r\n\"No orange-blossoms for my white hair,\" said she, laughing and flushing.\r\n\"They are for the dark curls of a young girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, youth! youth! youth!\" he exclaimed half bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Dear friend,\" said she very calmly and sweetly, \"youth is only so\r\nbeautiful when we have lost it. Middle life is stronger, pleasanter,\r\nnobler.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might cry for middle life too,\" Mr. Floyd said lightly, \"for I have\r\nlost that as well as youth. I am an old man: I have no to-morrows. Carry\r\nyour orange-blossoms away, Mary: their perfume is too strong for me.\"\r\n\r\nI had listened dreamily, without taking much meaning from their words.\r\nMy mother went on into the next conservatory and picked roses and\r\ncamellias, and Mr. Floyd watched her, shivered, and, passing his arm\r\nwithin mine, walked back into the first greenhouse, among the bristling\r\ncactuses and broad, silky-leaved bananas.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as you are free from college, Floyd,\" said he, \"you and I will\r\ngo to Europe; that is, if I am alive. The doctors say travel is good for\r\nme--occupation without fever, interest without personal emotion. Yes, a\r\nyear from July we will set out, and if Helen can go with us, she and\r\nyour mother shall be our companions.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about your position at Washington?\"\r\n\r\n\"After the fourth of March I shall never hold office again. I suppose\r\nthat is what is killing me: I have worked too hard and abused my\r\nstrength a little.\"\r\n\r\nI looked into his face. I was almost as tall as he now, and Mr. Floyd\r\nhad always been a head above other men. I put my hand on his shoulder\r\nand looked steadily into his face.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would tell me, sir,\" said I, \"what you mean when you say\r\nthese things. Are you really ill? Your allusions to your state of health\r\nare so painful to me, and to my mother too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he returned kindly, \"your mother knows all about it.\" He mused a\r\nlittle, then cheered up, laughed and clapped me on the shoulder. \"If I\r\nwere a man in decent health,\" he affirmed with an air of jollity, \"I\r\nshould be your father-in-law. No, that is not it: I should be your\r\nstepfather. Thank your stars that I have the modesty not to believe\r\nmyself irresistible under present circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why not?\" said I, quite in earnest. \"If you are less strong than\r\nformerly, all the more need of your having a wife. I should suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to my need, that is nothing, nothing. But think: if she cared for me\r\nI should be preparing tortures for her. She would feel nothing but\r\ndread. I may die at any time, Floyd, if I am shocked or startled.\r\nRaptures would not do for me, either: I should be afraid to kiss my\r\nwife, lest my heart should increase its beating by a throb a minute. No:\r\nI shall marry no one now: I have put by the hope, as an old man puts by\r\nall the dreams of his prime.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might all have come to pass,\" I exclaimed bitterly, \"had it not been\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my boy! my dear boy!\" said Mr. Floyd. \"When your accident came I\r\nforgot my own wishes at once, thinking only of your need of your mother.\r\nI would have given up more for you than that: I would have given up my\r\nlife. Come, come! we have fallen into too serious a vein. Let us talk\r\nabout our trip to Europe and the East. I never had the right sort of a\r\ntravelling-companion yet: wise men stay at home, but bores and noodles\r\ngo abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when we start the wise men will no longer be at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have hit it precisely. There are a few things I want to show\r\nyou--some cathedrals, landscapes and pictures. I will save you a world\r\nof trouble, and will instruct you at once to find certain objects\r\nfrightful and unworthy of notice or esteem. The zest of travel is taken\r\nout of one by the necessity of muttering vague formulas of meaningless\r\npraise before pictures and statues it is traditional to admire. There's\r\ntoo much of everything in this world. When a man has reached my age and\r\nmy state of health he feels the necessity of getting at the real\r\nsubstance of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can one get at it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't utter any precocious wisdom. Certainly, one can get at the\r\nsubstance of things. True, there is enough mystery and perplexity about\r\nthe system of the world, and at times all life looms up a terrible\r\nenigma, so increasing in difficulty of solution that Death's key to\r\nknowledge seems the one thing to be desired. But it is well for a man\r\nnot to lose himself in labyrinths of conjecture, but to resolutely put\r\naside his spirit of philosophical inquiry, and do something useful for\r\nhimself and his fellow-men. For my own part, I don't think Hamlet a fine\r\nfellow. Don't ask conundrums. Your duty now is to finish your collegiate\r\ncourse respectably. Take honors or not as it happens, but be a man, and\r\nwin yourself the place you ought to take, and keep it like a gentleman.\r\nThen we will travel, and I will remember you are young and let you do\r\nthe foolish things youth loves to do. We will have famous times\r\ntogether. Not that I altogether approve of vagabondizing. Still, what is\r\nthere for us to do? I am worn out: you are too young to have duties to\r\nsociety, and ought to try life, and examine, criticise and become\r\nenlightened. I suppose I shall catch the mania for bric-a-brac and\r\ncuriosities, and make them the object of my life, since I have no other.\r\nIf I do, I shall be obliged to will them to you, Floyd, for, Goodness\r\nknows, Helen will have enough to set up a museum of art without any help\r\nfrom me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" I rejoined: \"this house is so filled with wonderful\r\nthings. But Helen--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk about me, please,\" cried a voice from behind the acacias,\r\n\"for I am here;\" and the little girl came through the drooping branches\r\ncovered with their plumy canary-colored blossoms, and advanced toward us\r\nwith that wonderful princess-like gait of hers. She was smiling\r\ndemurely. \"Listeners hear no good of themselves, they say,\" she\r\nobserved, throwing a laughing glance at me.\r\n\r\n\"I was only about to remark that you seemed tolerably indifferent to\r\nyour possessions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" said Mr. Floyd teasingly, \"since Helen found that the\r\nmoon and the sea did not belong to her, she gave up, and has not\r\nbelieved she is so very rich, after all;\" and while he laughed and Helen\r\nblushed, and half hid herself, I heard how the child, when she was six\r\nyears old, had taken her new nursery-governess around the place, saying,\r\n\"This is my pony,\" \"These are my dogs,\" \"This is my conservatory,\" and\r\n\"These are my greenhouses:\" then, when she had exhausted the inventory\r\nof her wealth, she had affirmed, \"That is my moon\" and \"That is my\r\nwater;\" and when it was explained to her that the crescent over the pine\r\ntrees in the west belonged alike to all the children on the wide earth,\r\nand that the fickle sea too paid its homage at a thousand shores, she\r\nwas quite inconsolable, and nothing could make up to her for her loss.\r\n\r\nA very quiet, demure little woman was Helen now-a-days. I deplored the\r\nnecessity for the graceful French governess who was polishing her into a\r\nconventional manner and preparing her for the dull routine which other\r\ngirls must follow. I never analyzed my impressions of Helen then, but I\r\nam sure I considered her far above any commonplace educational needs,\r\nfor I knew that she was so wise, so disciplined, so true to all her\r\nduties, that she was altogether a woman, and not a little girl at all.\r\nIt gave me a positive shock to discover that she was ciphering in vulgar\r\nfractions and that her spelling was, to say the least, crude. Not but\r\nthat she was childish enough in many things, and so exquisitely docile\r\nwith her father that he often scolded her for her over-careful\r\nobedience. I could understand well enough myself how she liked to be led\r\nby the strong man who loved her, and whom she so dearly loved, because\r\nwhen she was alone with her grandfather she needed to govern, holding a\r\ndreary sway over her little kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, we were not intimate this winter. I was not of an\r\nage to be interested in a little girl in the schoolroom, and\r\nMademoiselle Blois took care not to allow the little girl in the\r\nschoolroom to take an interest in me. Occasionally, however, when she\r\nwas with her father and I joined them, the memories we shared between us\r\nbroke through the gossamer web of diffidence which shackled us both, and\r\nfor a little while we would be as free as in the old childish\r\nconfidential days on the seashore or back among the brown stubble of the\r\nstripped harvest-fields of the uplands. At these times she would ask me\r\nmany questions about Georgy Lenox, and when I told her that Georgy was\r\nquite a grown woman now, and engaged to my friend Jack Holt, she thought\r\nit wonderful and strange.\r\n\r\n\"But why?\" I asked. \"Georgy is a trifle older than I am, and I am now\r\nalmost nineteen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody is so old!\" she said with a droll little gesture of despair.\r\n\"It seems to me I shall never grow up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, you will soon be fourteen: I have heard you say your mother was\r\nmarried when she was seventeen: that is only three years off; and Georgy\r\nLenox is much older, and only just engaged, and will not be married\r\nuntil Jack is out of college and a partner in his father's business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he like her very much?\" asked Helen solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes: he has loved her ever since she was a very little girl. He\r\nhas spent all his money upon her: he knows all her little needs, her\r\ntastes. I have been out shopping with him frequently when he would\r\ndevote hours to the matching of a shade of ribbon or the selection of a\r\npeculiar color of gloves. Harry Dart is never tired of making fun of\r\nJack, for the dear old fellow is a little absurd in his painstaking for\r\na capricious girl who does not even know her own mind, and is certain to\r\nfind fault with even his most fastidious choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not like that,\" said Helen, so decidedly that I looked with\r\nsome surprise at the expression of her imperious face. \"I should want to\r\nhave everything, and give it all to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom? to Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear me, no! You know what I mean.\"\r\n\r\nI understood her, and I made an involuntary grimace in thinking of\r\nmademoiselle's chaste teachings in the schoolroom. Here was a little\r\ngirl of fourteen with her mind made up about what she would do for the\r\nlover who was to come out of Shadowland some day.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think that would be nicer, Floyd?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"For the girl to be rich, that she might make her husband rich? Some men\r\nwould like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you think?\"\r\n\r\nA boy of nineteen is not so glib in speaking of marriage as a girl of\r\nfourteen, but I finally told her that I should not fancy the destiny of\r\nmarrying a rich girl: then my imagination warmed, and I let her hear\r\nwhat my dream would be. She, the girl I loved, should be poor: very\r\nlikely life would have been cruel to her, and she would have known cold\r\nand privation. What joy I should have in wrapping her in costly things,\r\nin setting off her beauty with ornaments appropriate and rare! What a\r\nlight would shine in her eyes when I led her to the lovely house where\r\nwe two were to dwell in Fairyland! Every duty in life should be taken\r\nfrom her: all she would have to do would be to grow more and more\r\nbeautiful. I myself would be chief servant to this dainty little\r\nnew-made queen, and not even the winds should be allowed to play too\r\nfreely with her hair.\r\n\r\nHelen looked at me pensively, and Mr. Floyd, who was writing in the\r\ncorner, laughed a low amused laugh which reminded me for a moment of\r\nMephistopheles.\r\n\r\n\"So you would like that?\" mused Helen. \"Do you know, I should not like\r\nit at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you will never be poor,\" I retorted, \"and you will give your\r\ngolden key to some man who wants to marry a princess. But, to tell the\r\ntruth, Helen, I don't expect to marry anybody: I think it is great\r\nnonsense. Both Harry and I have made up our minds to be bachelors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nI had not seen Georgy Lenox for four years when, the spring we\r\ngraduated, she came to visit a cousin of her mother's in Boston, and we\r\nwere all invited to an Easter-party at Mrs. Dwight's, the cards being\r\nbrought to us by no less a person than Mr. Lenox himself. I was in my\r\nown room writing when I heard Harry's sweet voice calling, and I went\r\nout. Harry was, as usual, sitting on the table before his easel. It had\r\nbeen one of his guardian's regulations that he should not touch paints\r\nor canvas during his collegiate course, and until within the last few\r\nmonths he had obeyed orders, and only lately had taken to water-colors\r\nas a sort of negative course of action calculated to give him relaxation\r\nafter the monotony of his unnatural deprivation, without infringing upon\r\nhis uncle's injunctions. He was painting a girl in a flower-garden, and\r\nover his shoulder was gazing a shabby, jaunty, decayed-looking person,\r\nwho was strangely foreign to my eyes, yet irresistibly familiar.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember Mr. Lenox?\" asked Harry, staring at me. \"Have you\r\nforgotten the pleasures of your boyhood, miserable ingrate? Have you no\r\nrecollection of the big kite this benefactor of your youth made you,\r\nwhich dragged you down the hill and threw you into the ditch?\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember all about it,\" said I; and indeed I had been shaking hands\r\nwith my old friend all the time Harry was speaking.--\"And I am delighted\r\nto see you, Mr. Lenox.\"\r\n\r\nI began looking about me for a chair. In fact, finding a chair was the\r\none trouble of our three lives, and was the only way in which we felt\r\nhospitality to be a tax upon our time. For, although we had as many\r\nchairs as the room would accommodate, they were always full of books,\r\nfruit, cigars or hats and coats. There was one arm-chair, originally\r\ncovered with horsehair, which Harry called the \"funeral coach:\" it might\r\nhave been called anything, for it was so dingy, so battered, so broken,\r\nthat its _raison d'etre_ had come to be a matter of speculation. Into\r\nthis seat I now inducted our visitor. He was as shabby as the funeral\r\ncoach itself, but had kept up more gentility in his decay. I had not\r\nseen him for four years, and the lack of any change in his appearance\r\nsurprised me. There he was, as well shaven, as threadbare, as jaunty\r\nand well-mannered, as in the old days when we used to play the siege of\r\nTroy, using an old packing-case for the wooden horse, and he was our\r\nTrojan victim. I was much impressed by my own age, and said a good deal\r\nin those days about the flight of time and the mutability of human\r\naffairs: I expected anybody who was grown up when I was young to be well\r\nstricken in years; and if Mr. Lenox had been a shrunken old man with\r\naltered aspect and a deep sense of the worthlessness of all efforts\r\nafter temporalities, the change would have seemed only a reasonable one\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nBut, on the contrary, he was just the same as ever, and began talking at\r\nonce about a grand coup he was going to make presently by investing in a\r\nsilver-mine. He had two thousand dollars, and would buy shares at\r\nforty-nine, and be in time for the dividends of ten per cent. in July.\r\nThe stock was going up like a skyrocket: a week ago you could have\r\nbought it for nineteen.\r\n\r\nJack had come in now, and was standing behind his future father-in-law's\r\nchair. \"A skyrocket is a bad simile,\" he remarked. \"Everybody knows what\r\nit comes down.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lenox appeared so happy it seemed really a pity to wilt his\r\nenthusiasm: he had been beaten so many times that the prediction of\r\nfailure was a familiar knell to him. But Jack had no time to waste in\r\ntalk of any kind, and at once went into my room to study.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind Jack,\" said Harry: \"he is a born croaker. I dare say the\r\nsilver-mine is made of gold. How about the stock in the ---- Railroad\r\nthat your wife holds, Mr. Lenox?\" And we both laughed at the old joke.\r\n\r\nMr. Lenox smiled furtively: \"It was never safe to trust such a secret to\r\nscatter-brains like yourselves. But don't you know about the great\r\ndefalcation? Brown, the president of the road, absconded with over a\r\nmillion of dollars, and they have not paid a single dividend in three\r\nyears. You ought to hear my wife go on about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have an easy time: you didn't mind Brown's embezzlement,\" said\r\nHarry. \"What a stroke of luck for you! You can buy back your wife's ten\r\nshares at a low figure, and have a good conscience the rest of your\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, Harry! you have given me an idea. Just as soon as this new\r\nstock of mine gets above par I will sell out, reinvest and put the\r\ncertificates in my wife's bureau-drawer. I should breathe more freely,\r\nthere is no doubt of it. I confess to you, boys, it's a deuce of a life\r\nto keep a secret from a woman, she has you at such a disadvantage. Yes,\r\non my honor, I'll buy in some of that stock: it's utterly worthless for\r\nyears to come, and there must be thousands and thousands of shares of it\r\nin the market. Yes, I will do it as soon as I have made two hundred per\r\ncent. on my silver-mine. Yet it does seem a pity--\" and he gave us a\r\nprudent nod--\"to put money into such a broken-down concern.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are as rich as Croesus,\" remarked Harry, mixing his colors\r\nmeanwhile. \"It must be awfully jolly to take two thousand in one's\r\npocket and go out and buy a silver-mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" said Mr. Lenox confidentially, \"that old Raymond has\r\nshelled out at last. I wrote to him, but he took no notice; so I induced\r\nGeorgy to send a note to the little girl at The Headlands, and she\r\nsomehow persuaded her grandfather to let me have three thousand dollars.\r\nHe sent it in a way which robbed the courtesy of charm; but he is an old\r\nman, and for the sake of little Helen I did not repay him in kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what did he do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent me his check pinned to a scrap of paper on which he had scrawled,\r\n'A fool and his money are soon parted.' Of course I sent him my note of\r\nhand, and shall pay him as soon as possible. Do you happen to know,\r\nFloyd, anything of the ultimate disposal of his property--the terms of\r\nthe old gentleman's will?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing whatever about it,\" I answered, \"but have no doubt of\r\nHelen's being sole heiress. Why not? There is no other direct heir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am his nephew,\" said Mr. Lenox with his jauntiest air. \"I have no\r\ndoubt of my claims or the claims of my daughter being recognized by the\r\nhead of my family. By all accounts, too, Helen is a delicate child,\r\nfancifully reared and probably short-lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you get your information? Miss Floyd is a tall girl of fifteen\r\nnow, straight as an arrow, and can out-ride and out-walk any girl I\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish her no harm,\" exclaimed Mr. Lenox eagerly. \"I love the child as\r\nif she were my own. Georgy has always represented her as delicate and\r\npuny.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has not seen her for five years.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true! Don't repeat what I said: you know the code of men of honor\r\non these points, and what is said between friends is inviolate as the\r\ngrave. Little Helen Floyd has been a good friend to my poor girl, who\r\nhas none of Fortune's gifts. Not a month passes without a letter with an\r\nenclosure of money; and she begs Georgy to look upon her as a loving\r\nsister who is proud and glad to be of help to her in any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Miss Georgy accepts the money?\" drawled Harry with a well-known\r\nlook on his handsome face.\r\n\r\n\"Of course she does,\" responded Georgy's father with considerable heat.\r\n\"Mr. Raymond ought to do anything for her. The amount of that man's\r\nincome is fabulous, sir: I tell you, it is fabulous: he cannot begin to\r\nspend it. I sometimes doubt if he spends more than the interest of his\r\nincome. Reflect upon his principal; what must it be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's his own to do as he likes with, I suppose,\" said Harry,\r\nrather bored with the subject. \"And I am sure you cannot complain, since\r\nyou are jingling his money in your pocket this very moment. How did it\r\nhappen that when Miss Georgy was at Mr. Raymond's she did not make the\r\nold gentleman take a fancy to her? She turns most people's heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was always a mystery to me,\" returned Mr. Lenox mournfully. \"But Mr.\r\nRaymond does not like my wife, nor, I sometimes think, does he like me.\r\nThe truth of the matter is, that that unlucky Hermetically-Sealed Barrel\r\nCompany--\"\r\n\r\nHarry looked at me. The unlucky Hermetically-Sealed Barrel Company had\r\nbeen one of our old jokes at Belfield, for we had been compelled to hear\r\nits history a hundred times over. It seemed to me, in my youthful\r\nwisdom, odd and pitiful that while we had grown from boyishness into\r\nsomething better, leaving follies and weaknesses behind us, this man,\r\nalmost thrice our age, still studied the old pages of his book, not\r\nreading them with any clearer vision than before, in spite of all his\r\nexperience. Why did he not turn the leaf and take a different story?\r\nExperienced in life as I believed myself in those days, I had not\r\nlearned then that we halt groping over one lesson throughout our\r\ncareers. Although our harps seem tuned for the most various harmonies,\r\nwe strike the same chords over and over again in hopeless iteration.\r\n\r\nSo we got him off the subject, and talked college-talk, and told him\r\nabout the probable appointments for commencement. He was one of our\r\nalumni, liked our gossip, and could supplement our stories with those of\r\nthe jollier days twenty-five or thirty years before. Harry and I nearly\r\ndied of suppressed laughter as he gravely informed us that he had\r\nexpected the valedictory, and was served badly when it was given to\r\nanother. It appeared a huge joke that this seedy, broken-down man,\r\nwithout a person in the wide world to respect him or believe in him,\r\ncould ever have been justified in any of our high hopes--could ever have\r\nstood in the places we filled now, and, like us, securely counted on\r\nwinning the prizes of life.\r\n\r\nThen he produced the little white envelopes which he had hitherto\r\nforgotten, and we read that Mrs. Dwight presented us her compliments and\r\nhoped to see us for a social gathering at her house the next Wednesday\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Georgy's writing,\" said Harry, putting his down.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know, you rascal? She certainly does not write to you\r\nusually.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but she writes to a fellow I know,\" returned Harry, nodding toward\r\nthe next room. We all abated our tones now, and talked softly about\r\nGeorgy, not wishing Jack to hear. Mr. Lenox was always eloquent upon\r\nthis theme. He had brought her up to town himself three days before, and\r\nthe Dwights were charmed with her--could not do enough for her. She was\r\nthe one success of his life, and no wonder she was precious to him. A\r\ngood deal of his ready money had gone into her outfit, which must be\r\nsuitable for an aristocratic house and Easter gayeties, and he had put\r\noff getting a new coat until his stock was ripe for harvest. The Dwights\r\nhad not seen him, you may be sure. He knew that such people would think\r\nless of Georgy for having a seedy old father out at elbows, so he was\r\nwilling to keep in the background. This very morning, however, Georgy\r\nhad come out for a rendezvous in a secluded corner of the Common, and\r\nhad taken rare delight in the assignation and pretended he was her lover\r\nwhom she was forced to meet in secret.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say she has tripped out before to meet somebody,\" said Harry,\r\nwho was always cynical regarding women, but especially severe where\r\nGeorgy was concerned. \"Girls practise those wiles on fathers and\r\nbrothers, that they may do the thing neatly when a lover turns up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! For the matter of that, it has sometimes seemed a little hard\r\nupon my girl that, although she is engaged to the best fellow in the\r\nworld, she should have no chance to win lovers from society at large.\r\nNot but that I am glad that her future is so secure--a most fortunate\r\nmatch for her. I am proud when I think of it.\"\r\n\r\nWell he might be proud. It is something out of the course of every-day\r\nevents for a girl to possess the love of a man like Jack, whose nature\r\ncombined the strongest masculine qualities with the tenderness and\r\nfaithfulness of a woman. Of a woman? Strange how we use phrases which\r\nhave outworn their meaning! Jack's tenderness and faithfulness were\r\naltogether without parallel.\r\n\r\n     ELLEN W. OLNEY.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL SKETCHES OF SOME FRENCH LITTERATEURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, any Frenchman will tell you, is the capital of intellect; and\r\nthough this is but one of a hundred things equally flattering to their\r\ncountry which all Frenchmen believe, yet it happens to be true. In some\r\nsocieties it is social rank, in others wealth and fine houses, in\r\nothers, still, capacity to render service to the state, which makes old\r\nmen courted and opens doors to the novice. But in Paris it is brains. If\r\nyou have written a book or painted a picture or discovered a scientific\r\ntheory, you have at once a reserved seat, as it were, in the social\r\nworld, and nobody thinks of asking who your father was, or where you\r\nlive, or what your income may be. With the literary society the\r\npolitical is so closely allied that the two may be said to coincide.\r\nThere are coteries of course, but there are also neutral grounds on\r\nwhich members of all sets meet in peace and separate in harmony; and\r\nespecially since the Republic has become firmly established the barriers\r\nbased upon party differences have tended steadily to disappear. During\r\nthe Empire some of the cleverest writers, such as Sainte-Beuve and\r\nMerimee and About, were imperialists: now they are all dead or have\r\nchanged their politics. During this period, too, the intelligent and\r\nliterary opposition was mostly Orleanistic, but the last seven years\r\nhave clearly shown not only that the bourgeois monarchy had no roots in\r\nthe heart of the people, but also that the conservative Republic\r\npossesses all its advantages, combined with few of its objectionable\r\nqualities. To men like Renan and Laugel, who have been Orleanists all\r\ntheir lives, and who cherish a personal affection for the party, the\r\nsituation appears melancholy, and the wail of Renan in his last book is\r\nsad enough. He is French to the core; supports openly the doctrine, \"My\r\ncountry--right or wrong;\" finds the centralization of the French system,\r\ncarried to its logical extreme, the ideal government; and hates, above\r\nall things, \"Americanism.\" What strikes an Anglo-Saxon as the merest\r\ncommonplace of healthy politics or intellectual life is in his eyes the\r\nmost pernicious heresy. We believe that freedom to teach and to write is\r\nthe only way to discover the truth, and are confident that in the\r\nstruggle of life which opposing systems must pass through the truth is\r\nsure in the end to win. Not so Renan. \"The idea that there is a true\r\nknowledge, which must be taught, protected, patronized by the state, to\r\nthe exclusion of false knowledge, is losing ground--one of the results\r\nof the general enfeeblement of notions of government.\" This is bad\r\nenough, but the political situation is even worse than the moral and\r\nintellectual; for M. Renan finds that France has \"preferred the\r\ndemocratic programme, according to which the state, composed of the\r\nagglomeration of individuals, having no other object than the happiness\r\nof these individuals _as they themselves understand it_, gives up all\r\nnotion of initiative above their feelings and ideas. The consequence of\r\nsuch a state of things is the pursuit of prosperity and liberty, the\r\ndestruction of whatever remains of the spirit of class, weakening of the\r\npower of the state. Individuals and the subordinate groups of the state,\r\nsuch as the county and the township, will prosper under such a regime;\r\nbut it is to be feared that the nation, the country--France--will lose\r\nevery day something of its authority and its strong cohesion. The period\r\nwhich we are entering upon will be one of liberty _a l'Americaine_.\"\r\n\r\nAll this seems mournful to men of Renan's type, and to young men of\r\nfashion who sigh for the \"elegance\" of the Empire or the Restoration,\r\nand pose consequently as imperialists or as adherents of Henri V. But\r\nthe mass of the nation is supremely contented. The peasants say that the\r\nRepublic is the only government which does not go to war; the middle\r\nclasses, richer and more numerous in France than in any other country,\r\nare happy in having the care of their material interests in their own\r\nhands, and especially in the consciousness that they are now the ruling\r\nclass, and that bourgeois intelligence and respectability, rather than\r\nimperial frivolity or royal pietism, is the prevailing idea. Even Renan\r\nadmits that \"the present hour is sweet:\" what troubles him is the\r\nthought of the future. But the republicans are not troubled at all. They\r\ndon't intend to carry out any great reforms; they wish to avoid all\r\nforeign complications until the yearned-for hour arrives when Germany\r\nwill be forced to disgorge what they are pleased to term its ill-gotten\r\nbooty; they have in their ranks almost all the administrative and\r\noratorical powers of the country; and they tell you that M. Grevy, the\r\npresent president of the Chamber of Deputies, will succeed to the\r\npresidency, when the \"stupid\" MacMahon goes out, with just as little\r\ndifficulty as the latter had in coming in, and that he, in turn, will in\r\nall probability be succeeded by Gambetta. These two men are bourgeois to\r\nthe tips of their fingers, as was Thiers--modest, leading a regular\r\nlife; well-informed on all local matters, and naively ignorant of the\r\nrest of the world; not strong believers in political economy; prudent\r\nand anti-clerical. Only, Gambetta, being twenty years younger than\r\nGrevy, is by twenty years more fiery and radical.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not complain that he has been entrapped into reading a\r\nleader on French politics when he desired nothing of the sort; for,\r\nwithout bearing in mind these preliminary facts, it is quite impossible\r\nto understand the relations of French literary men among themselves.\r\nParty passion has ever run high in France, and now that everybody can\r\nfreely speak his mind, it has become more difficult than ever for even\r\nthe oldest friendship to stand the strain of daily discussion. Take the\r\ninstance of M. About and M. Taine. They were schoolboys together, and it\r\nwould be hard to say which of the two most distinguished himself at this\r\nperiod of his career. They were both prodigies, but, though rivals, the\r\nfastest friends. After they had emerged from the Ecole Normale they went\r\nand set up housekeeping together in an old house in the Quartier Latin;\r\nand as they were both poor as rats, the difficulties they had in keeping\r\nsoul and body together recall the most picturesque and thrilling scenes\r\nin Murger's _Vie de Boheme_. One day they discovered that they had\r\nneither money nor anything to eat, and About started out to scare up\r\nsome nutriment for the inner man. After a while he returned laden with a\r\nbasket containing a dozen bottles of wine and various packets of\r\nprovisions, and followed by an organ-grinder. Taine was of course no\r\nless pleased than astonished, but he demanded an explanation. \"Oh,\" said\r\nAbout, \"I stumbled across a wine-dealer who wanted a first-class\r\nadvertisement done in the highest style of art, so I sat down and wrote\r\nit for him, and he gave me fifty francs and this wine.\"--\"But the\r\norgan-grinder?\" pursued Taine.--\"Heavens!\" exclaimed his friend, \"you\r\ndon't think one can enjoy a banquet without music, do you? Come, fall\r\nto; and you, old buffer, go to work on that divine instrument of yours;\"\r\nwhich the old buffer proceeded to do, probably more to the satisfaction\r\nof his employer than to that of Taine.\r\n\r\nNor was lively companionship and assistance of this sort all that the\r\nfuture philosopher and critic owed to the friend of his youth: he\r\nprobably owes him his life also, and hence the world is, in a sense,\r\nindebted to M. About for the _History of English Literature_ and _Les\r\nOrigines de la France contemporaine_. While they were living in the\r\nstyle above described Taine was taken suddenly ill, and, as the common\r\npurse was not sufficiently full to enable him to consult a physician,\r\nthe two went to see a clever medical student of the quartier and\r\nrequested his advice. The budding doctor examined Taine carefully, and\r\nfinally pronounced that there was but one thing for him to do, and that\r\nthing was to go to the Pyrenees. \"You might as well tell me to go to the\r\nmoon,\" said the poor fellow. \"Ah, well,\" replied the student, \"you asked\r\nmy opinion, and I have given it; and I may add that if you don't do\r\nwhat I tell you, you are a dead man.\" It may be imagined that the two\r\nfriends did not pass a particularly pleasant evening; but after much\r\ncogitation About hit upon a possible means of relief; which, however, he\r\nkept to himself.\r\n\r\nAbout's youthful talent was as precocious as his matured abilities are\r\nbrilliant, and he had at this time published a book. One evening during\r\nthe last season the present writer formed one of a group of three to\r\nwhom he narrated, in a most charming manner, how he had made the\r\nacquaintance of the great publisher Hachette, a granddaughter of whom\r\nwas another of the trio. He had left his manuscript at the\r\npublishing-house, and after some time was informed that the firm would\r\nbe happy to publish it, and to pay him in cash for the copyright eight\r\nhundred francs--an offer with which he closed immediately. A week or so\r\nlater he was visited, to his astonishment, by the great publisher in\r\nperson. \"Sir,\" began the latter, \"it is often said that publishers don't\r\nknow how to read, and I myself know some who drive a thriving trade on\r\nthat principle. But I read occasionally the books which I publish, and I\r\nhave read yours. I am unable to approve the contract which my agent has\r\nmade with you. You have parted with your copyright for eight hundred\r\nfrancs: I return to you the contract, you retain the copyright, and I\r\ngive you for the edition fifteen hundred francs.\" About was even more\r\ntouched by the publisher's kindness than he was gratified by his\r\ngenerosity, and the two men mutually pleased each other--a fact which\r\nthe younger now proposed to turn to account in aid of his friend Taine.\r\nSo he went to M. Hachette with the following proposition: \"I have a\r\nfriend named Taine, who is very ill, and I want you to send him to the\r\nPyrenees.\"--\"But, M. About, I don't know your friend, and why, in\r\nHeaven's name, should I send him to the Pyrenees?\"--\"But he is a genius,\r\nhe will be famous one day, and he will make your fortune. Your fortune\r\nis already made, I know, but he will increase it.\" The publisher then\r\nremarked that the name Taine was familiar to him, and finally dismissed\r\nhis enthusiastic author with a promise to consider the matter. In a few\r\ndays Taine received a note requesting him to come and dine with M.\r\nHachette at his country-place just outside of Paris. The two young men\r\nwere again in the depths of financial need, and all the money they could\r\nscrape together was barely sufficient to pay for a railway-ticket. Taine\r\nwas quite nonplussed by the invitation--did not know what to make of it;\r\nbut About persuaded him to accept, saying that he would at least have a\r\ngood dinner, which was more than he could expect at home. And so he\r\nwent. The publisher was politeness and cordiality itself, complimented\r\nhis guest on his successes at the Ecole Normale, and after dinner took\r\nhim aside and said: \"M. Taine, we want a book written on the Pyrenees,\r\nand we think you are the best man we can get to do it. If you accept our\r\noffer you will start at once for that region, you will deliver us the\r\nmanuscript in six months, and we will pay you for it six thousand\r\nfrancs; of which I have the pleasure of offering you half to-day.\" This,\r\nthe first of Taine's books, duly appeared, and was a great commercial as\r\nwell as literary success, so that the publisher had no cause to regret\r\nhis generosity.\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that a friendship founded and sustained in this\r\nfashion would be tolerably secure against the wear and tear of life,\r\nespecially if no personal difficulties intervened. And so it might in\r\nany other land; but literary Frenchmen are too much sentimentalists and\r\ndoctrinaires to allow friendship or anything else to stand in the way of\r\nthe expression of their opinion, in season or out of season, in regard\r\nto what, from their individual standpoint, constitutes the public weal.\r\nLove me, love my dog; subscribe to all my opinions; follow all my\r\npolitical changes or I disown you,--when people guide their conduct by\r\nthis principle all pairs of friends, except such a one as Boswell and\r\nDr. Johnson's, sooner or later must separate. Taine is an observer, an\r\ninvestigator, a critic; and having devoted himself in turn to travel and\r\nto the study of metaphysics, of art and of literature, he has now turned\r\nhis attention to recent French history; and the book he has written is\r\nnot at all to the taste of sentimental politicians of the About type.\r\nThe reader will not need to be reminded that there is no country in the\r\nworld so favorable to the growth of \"legend\" as France: the petite\r\nbourgeoisie of Paris, as I found by personal experience, has already\r\nfabricated a complete legendary history of the Commune, and there is no\r\nsubject on which the average Frenchman is so ignorant, and on which his\r\nignorance is so precious to him, as the real character of the Great\r\nRevolution. As France is the guide of nations; as it represents, and\r\nalways has represented, the summit of civilization; as it has ever\r\npossessed the greatest hearts, the purest spirits, as well as the most\r\nbrilliant intellects of the time,--why, it is nothing less than high\r\ntreason for a Frenchman to turn round and begin to show up the weakness\r\nor wickedness of, say, Robespierre. This sort of thing is pardonable\r\nonly when the exposure of some historical character is offensive to the\r\nreigning government, as was the case with the early volumes of Lanfrey's\r\n_Napoleon_. About probably knows the truth about the men of '92 and '93\r\nas well as anybody, but he thinks it desirable that the illusions\r\nrespecting them should continue. They are, he says, an important\r\npolitical factor. Whereas Taine, like the late MM. Lanfrey and De\r\nTocqueville, loving truth for its own sake, slashes away without caring\r\nfor the practical result. I was told by an intimate and lifelong friend\r\nof both men that it had required the most persistent efforts of persons\r\nsituated like himself to prevent About's sharply attacking Taine in his\r\npaper (since the appearance of _La Revolution_ the radicals have favored\r\nits author with the epithet of \"reactionnaire\"); in which case a rupture\r\nwould have been unavoidable.\r\n\r\nTaine does not like German historians nor German methods of working up\r\nhistory, and he absolutely denies what, to my mind, is their greatest\r\nand most unrivalled excellence--their relative impartiality. Mommsen was\r\nthe subject of unsparing denunciation, as having used Roman history as a\r\nmannikin by which he could illustrate certain views on contemporary\r\nGerman politics. Mommsen is an author of whom I know little, but there\r\nis another German historian, Von Sybel, who seems to me the most\r\nadmirable writer in this department with whom I am acquainted; and as\r\nhis great work partially covers the same period to which Taine has\r\nrecently devoted himself, I ventured to mention his name in this\r\nconnection. But I might as well have stirred up a hornet's nest. \"Von\r\nSybel,\" said Taine, \"wrote his book to prove that Prussia was perfectly\r\nright in taking part in the partition of Poland, and some other things\r\nof like nature.\" He seemed to think this assertion (admitting its truth)\r\nsettled Von Sybel's place in literature as definitely as if he had said\r\nhe had written a book to prove Friedrich II. to have been the son of\r\nJupiter or that the Prussians were God's chosen people. One would have\r\nsupposed that the fact of a man's holding such an opinion in regard to\r\nthe partition of Poland sufficient evidence for sending him to a lunatic\r\nasylum, although most people believe it to be a perfectly established\r\nhistoric truth. Taine would not even admit the excellence of Von Sybel's\r\nstyle--well enough, he said, and clear, but the style of a leader-writer\r\nin the ---- (naming an old, soberly, but far from stupidly written Paris\r\ndaily--one of the most readable papers in Paris, and the favorite of the\r\npetite bourgeoisie). I mentioned the reputation Von Sybel enjoyed in\r\nGermany as having an excellent style, and the response was, \"Very\r\nlikely: where all the rest are blind a one-eyed man sees very well\"--a\r\nremark true enough as regards the mass of German writers, but very\r\nunjust to the person under discussion. Taine's models are Macaulay and\r\nFroude, but one would hardly think so from reading his _France\r\ncontemporaine_. Be their demerits what they may--and they are no doubt\r\ngreat--the two English historians certainly have the faculty of\r\npresenting a sharply-outlined and vivid picture, while Taine heaps up\r\nhundreds of little facts, so that the reader, as the French say, can\r\nhardly see the wood for the trees. I may add that the French scholar's\r\nopinion of Prescott and Motley and Bancroft is still lower than that\r\nwhich he cherishes for their German contemporaries.\r\n\r\nTaine has more the air of a scholar, and less that of a man of the\r\nworld, than any other litterateur whom I met at Paris. During the winter\r\nhis wife receives once a fortnight, and he regularly attends the famous\r\nweekly dinners of the Princess Mathilde, and occasionally dines\r\ninformally with some intimate friend; but beyond this he goes but little\r\ninto society, and takes his opinions of it at second hand; with regard\r\nto which fact Sainte-Beuve once kindly remonstrated with him in an\r\nadmirable letter printed in the second volume of the _Correspondance_.\r\nHe is fifty years old, and made, some sixteen years ago, what, in\r\nrespect to the rank and wealth and amiable and intellectual qualities of\r\nhis wife, was a very brilliant marriage. The story of the wooing is a\r\n\"romance in real life.\" They have two children, the usual size of French\r\nfamilies, though About has seven--\"toute une famille anglaise,\" as\r\nMadame About remarked to me--whether with pride or in a half-ashamed\r\nhappiness I did not discover. The Taines live handsomely in the midst of\r\nthe Faubourg St. Germain, in a house whose windows have a clear view of\r\nthe Hotel des Invalides across the gardens of the Sacre-Coeur. I would\r\nsay that I found Taine particularly courteous and cordial, were it not\r\nthat I met no French gentleman who in any other society would not be\r\ndistinguished for perfection of manner and winning kindness.\r\n\r\nTaine has often been urged by friends who have been in America to visit\r\nthe United States, both with a view to repair his somewhat shattered\r\nhealth and to write a book about us after the manner of his _Notes on\r\nEngland_. He always says he will do so; and it is probable that upon\r\nthe completion of the great work, of which the third and last volume is\r\nnow nearly finished, he and Madame Taine will set sail for our shores.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of Paris, regarded as a _weltstadt_, is, that\r\nit contains no socially disreputable quarters: there is no part of the\r\ncity where men of wealth and position do not live. Thus, Theuriet and\r\nCherbuliez reside in the Quartier du Luxembourg (between the Latin\r\nQuarter and the Faubourg St. Germain), as did Sainte-Beuve, About and\r\nTourgueneff in the Rue de Douai (toward Montmartre), Girardin and Dumas\r\nin the Champs Elysees, Feuillet in the Rue de Rivoli, etc. Feuillet's\r\nname is, I think, as well known in the United States as that of any\r\nFrench man of letters except Taine, and if his biography were written he\r\nwould be as famous for his eccentricities as was Balzac. An old friend\r\nof his once told me that one day, in calling upon Madame Feuillet, he\r\nexpressed his regret that she had no regular reception-day, as in that\r\ncase he would be able to see her more frequently. \"Well,\" she answered,\r\n\"I should like to have one, but, you see, it is quite impossible. One\r\ncan't light the candles till after four o'clock, and before that time it\r\nis so dark here in the entresol that you can't see anybody.\" (I should\r\nhave prefaced this anecdote by saying, for the benefit of those readers\r\nwho have never been in Paris, that the entresol is a low story just over\r\nthe shops, and that the Rue de Rivoli is one of the noisiest streets in\r\nthe city.)--\"But Feuillet has leased the third and fourth floors: why\r\ndon't you receive up there?\" responded the visitor.--\"Oh, Octave would\r\nnever hear of such a thing. Why, when I merely asked leave to hang some\r\nof my dresses up stairs, he would not let me: 'I have leased this whole\r\nstory in order to have silence about me when I write, and the story\r\noverhead to have quiet above me. If you should hang your dresses up\r\nhere, your maid would all the time be rummaging round, and that would\r\nderange my thoughts.'\" Another of Feuillet's oddities is his hatred of\r\nrailways. He has a country-place on the coast in Normandy, and every\r\nsummer sends down his wife and children and servant by rail; after\r\nwhich, like a Russian grand seigneur, he goes down himself with\r\npost-horses. I am inclined to think Feuillet has greater genius than any\r\nother living writer of French fiction, with one exception. His _Monsieur\r\nde Camors_, for instance, is a masterpiece, though one of the most\r\npainful and unhealthy books ever written. But his talent is essentially\r\ndramatic talent, and when he writes a novel his inner consciousness, in\r\nspite of himself, is centred upon the stage effect. Thus, in his last\r\nstory, _Les Amours de Philippe_, there is no unity whatever, the book\r\nconsisting of three distinct and independent episodes, precisely\r\ncorresponding to the three acts of a play. The first of these parts is\r\none of the most agreeable pieces of writing in French literature, a\r\nreally charming little idyl--a Parisian idyl, to be sure, and not\r\nprecisely the most suitable reading for young girls. Nothing is more\r\npeculiar than a Frenchman's ideas of morality in literature; for,\r\nstrange as it may appear, several of Feuillet's books are considered\r\nhighly edifying, and the secretary of the Academy, upon his entrance\r\ninto that august body, was able to greet him with the, in France, by no\r\nmeans negative praise that it was not his fault if there still existed\r\n_mauvaises menages_. Feuillet, rather by sentiment than by conviction,\r\nit would appear, is an ardent Catholic, and, like Dumas, owes no small\r\nportion of his worldly success to the appreciation of this fact in high\r\nquarters. Another of his peculiarities is, that almost alone among the\r\nwriters of the day he cherishes a lingering regret for the pleasant days\r\nof the Empire, when for a long period he was not only a favorite at the\r\nTuileries and Compiegne, but almost the only man of talent who found it\r\npossible to write.\r\n\r\nAnother writer whom I used to meet in Paris, at About's and at his own\r\nhouse, was Andre Theuriet, favorably known in America by his lovely\r\nlittle story of _Gerard's Marriage_. I had read that and other almost\r\nequally charming tales of its author, and felt a strong desire to see\r\nhim. Of some literary men one creates in his mind's eye a picture of\r\nwhich the colors are the impressions produced by their books, and I had\r\nimagined Theuriet either a youngish man with a pretty wife or a\r\ngray-haired paterfamilias with two or three grown-up sons and daughters.\r\nTheuriet's hair is partially gray, to be sure, but he is unmarried, and\r\nby no means _bon enfant_ as regards personal appearance. He was born in\r\n1833 at Marly-le-Roi, near Paris, but educated in a little town in\r\nLorraine, where his mother's family lived, and whither he still returns\r\ntwo or three times a year, as he said to me, \"to run in the woods.\" He\r\nearly entered the civil service, and was long stationed at Auberive, a\r\nplace situated in the forest-region on the edge of Burgundy, and about\r\nwhich is laid the scene of his novels _Gerard_ and _Raymonde_. For the\r\nlast eight years his official duties have caused him to live at Paris,\r\nand it is during this period that his works of fiction have been\r\nproduced. Theuriet is a poet as well as a novelist, and his poetry is\r\nsaid by competent critics to be very good; but the public looks with a\r\nmore kindly eye upon his novels, and as their author cannot afford to\r\ndisdain contemporary profit and reputation, he has been obliged rather\r\nto show the cold shoulder to the Muse. Theuriet's appearance in letters\r\nand his popularity are, I think, to be taken as a sign that a healthy\r\nchange is going on in the taste of French readers. His books,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, are a protest against the system in which\r\nyoung girls are brought up in France, and which most intelligent\r\nFrenchmen deplore. It is less from an innate tendency to that sort of\r\nthing than because young girls of their own rank must not only always be\r\nunder the eye of a chaperone, but also are intentionally afflicted with\r\na deadly ignorance, incapacity to talk or to make themselves agreeable,\r\nthat the young men leave them for the society of _cocottes_. Now,\r\nTheuriet has been a good deal in the society of English people, and\r\nwhile he stoutly maintains that his girl-characters are thoroughly\r\nFrench, he yet admits that the idea of describing a kind of young girl\r\nthat in France is always assumed to be hoydenish and ill-brought-up,\r\ncame to him from observing the family-life of his neighbors from across\r\nthe Channel. Theuriet is not a great writer: he has none of that power\r\nof analyzing physical and mental emotions in which Balzac and Stendhal\r\nare the great adepts, though their descriptions, while unquestionably\r\nimplying great knowledge of the human heart, produce upon the\r\nAnglo-Saxon reader a feeling of pain, of offence, and often of disgust.\r\nI once asked him if he thought France, under the present bourgeois\r\nregime, likely to return to a healthier taste in literature, and\r\nreceived as answer the assurance that since coarse and sordid realism\r\n_could_ go no further than _L'Assommoir_, a reaction _must_ set in. From\r\nthe filthiness of low life, I dare say, but how about the elegant\r\nfleshliness of the previous school? France will have to undergo a\r\ncomplete turning inside out before this loses its hold upon the national\r\nmind; as a proof of which I may mention the fact that a man who knew as\r\nmuch of the world and of books as Taine does, one day said to me that\r\nthe best advice he could offer to a foreigner who thought of devoting\r\nhimself to letters was to carry back with him, to his own country,\r\nBalzac, Stendhal and Merimee.\r\n\r\nOf all the men of letters at Paris, there was no one for whose works I\r\ncherished so hearty an admiration as I did for those of Ivan\r\nTourgueneff, and none in whose personality I felt so profound an\r\ninterest. Tourgueneff is far from being a model novelist, but his tales\r\nare written with wonderful power, and yet are neither indecent nor\r\nmelodramatic nor rasping to the nerves. That the burden of strong\r\nnatures is in proportion to their strength, that human nature in general\r\nis weak, and that the Devil still sometimes appears incarnate in the\r\nperson of lovely woman, seem to form his theory of life. Hence his\r\nstories are ever sad, but they are not depressing; for his weak\r\ncharacters we sympathize with and do not despise, his strong and\r\ngenerous ones we sorrow for, his lovely women we reverence. And,\r\nhowever great one's admiration of Tourgueneff's books may be, the man\r\nTourgueneff will not appear unworthy of them. What storms may, in\r\nearlier years, have passed over the heart of the now sixty-year-old man\r\nI do not know, but now his rather aged face, fringed with perfectly\r\nwhite hair and beard, bears an expression of perfect peace. Much of his\r\ntime is constantly employed in helping others, and, from all I heard,\r\nMadame Greville hardly exaggerated when she said to me, \"He is a saint,\r\na nineteenth-century saint!\" And withal he is one of the most guileless\r\nof men: whatever he may think of men in general, he never can bring\r\nhimself to think ill of any man in particular.\r\n\r\nTourgueneff has now for a long period passed at least six months of the\r\nyear in Paris, and only three or four in Russia. He used to spend the\r\nsummer at Baden, but since the war he has exchanged Baden for\r\nCarlsbad--whether or not on account of sympathy with France, and hence\r\nhatred of the peacefully-disposed nation which it is pleased to consider\r\nits deadly enemy, I do not know. It might well be, for he feels almost\r\nas strongly as a Frenchman as he does as a Russian, and I met no one in\r\nFrance who was so enthusiastic a republican as he. The present French\r\nRepublic (which he insists is fundamentally and thoroughly different\r\nfrom the Republics of '93 and '48, as well as from that of the United\r\nStates) seems to be his ideal government. In a century, he says, there\r\nwon't be a king in Europe, except perhaps in England, and there he will\r\nbe nothing but a pageant--a political mummy shown to the populace at so\r\nmuch a head.\r\n\r\nIn writing of the great Russian novelist it naturally suggests itself to\r\nsay a word upon Madame Emile Durand, or \"Henri Greville,\" who has lately\r\nachieved so universal a reputation. One of her slightest efforts has\r\njust been crowned by the Academy, and one or more of her tales has been\r\ntranslated into all the tongues of Europe, including Dutch and Spanish.\r\nThe Durands, who are childless, reside in a little _pavillon_, or house\r\nwith garden behind the main structure which fronts the street, in the\r\nnot very inviting region of Montmartre. Madame Greville is a\r\ncomfortable-looking lady of thirty-five with the air of forty, and is a\r\nmost agreeable talker. In her varied experience she has seen a good deal\r\nof the up and downs of life, but has now settled down, as she told me,\r\n\"to making her three novels a year.\" I hardly think she will ever again\r\nreach the level of the _Expiation de Saveli_. Her husband is the Paris\r\ncorrespondent of a St. Petersburg paper, and incidentally a painter.\r\n\r\nNo sketch of French literary society, however short, should omit mention\r\nof that most famous of all periodicals, the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. It\r\nis forty-eight years old, and during its long life it has seen perhaps a\r\nhundred rivals rise and fall, while it has itself gone on constantly\r\nincreasing in importance, so that it is now become an institution, like\r\nthe Academy or the Comedie Francaise. Its offices are located in a fine\r\nold hotel not far from the noble faubourg, where M. Charles Buloz (son\r\nof the founder of the _Revue_) and his wife give during the winter\r\nfortnightly receptions to the contributors and their friends, as well as\r\nliterary dinner-parties which form, I suppose, the most catholic\r\nreunions in Paris; and for the excellent reason that all opinions except\r\nblatant radicalism and the dogmatic idiocy of Bishop Dupanloup and his\r\nfriends are represented by its contributors. By admitting him to its\r\ncolumns the _Revue_ gives a French author a stamp of approval which\r\nsuffices to make him known and respected (at least as regards talent) in\r\nall quarters of the globe. As was the late, so is the present, manager\r\nfully conscious of his power, and feels as independent with regard to\r\nhis authors as does the director of the Theatre Francais toward his. A\r\nshort time since the most famous of those literary Frenchmen who are not\r\nnovelists, and a man who rarely writes for periodical publications, sent\r\nan important contribution to the _Revue_, but neither the name of the\r\nauthor nor the fact that the contribution was of a character to attract\r\ngreat attention among the public induced M. Buloz to print what seemed\r\nto him, from a literary point of view, unworthy of a place in the\r\ncolumns of this journal. The pecuniary rewards of writing for the latter\r\nare but slight: a writer receives nothing at all for his first article,\r\nand afterward the prices vary--not in proportion to the merit of the\r\nproduction, but in relation to the reputation of the author. Henri\r\nGreville, for instance, obtained for her _L'Expiation de Saveli_--a\r\nnovel which, I am inclined to think, will not only always remain her\r\nmasterpiece, but will ever be considered a most perfect work of art--but\r\none hundred and fifty dollars; and the ordinary price for articles upon\r\nhistorical or philosophical or art topics is but one dollar to two\r\ndollars per page. It is odd, too, considering the artistic eye and touch\r\npossessed by Frenchmen, and their sensitiveness in regard to such\r\nmatters, that the _Revue_, in spite of its large circulation and high\r\nsubscription-price, is the worst printed magazine in the world. To\r\nAmerican readers, who have doubtless noticed with pleasure the attention\r\npaid of late years by the _Revue_ to American literature, it will\r\nperhaps be interesting to learn that \"Thomas Bentzon,\" who has\r\ndiscovered for the French public so many of our authors, is a Madame\r\nBlanc. She was described to me as a woman of great intelligence and the\r\nhighest character, the daughter of an old but poor noble family, and\r\nearly married to a wealthy banker. This person not proving to be a model\r\nhusband, his wife sought a separation; and the fault being obviously on\r\nhis side, he was ordered by the court to make Madame Blanc a handsome\r\nallowance. She, however, refused to take the money of a man whom she\r\ncould not respect, and having consented to accept only the small annual\r\nsum necessary for their child's education, set bravely but quietly to\r\nwork to earn her own living--a task in which she has slowly succeeded.\r\n\r\n    ARTHUR VENNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS GREAT DEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the old Norse legends we are sure to find the inevitable three\r\nbrothers, to the youngest of whom, Grimmel, fall all the adventures, the\r\ndealings with the Devil, and the pot of yellow gold at the end.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago there lived in a lonely hut on Mount Mitchell in\r\nNorth Carolina this identical Grimmel and his brothers. Their father,\r\nJohn Boyer, was a hunter. When he died the two elder sons, Richard and\r\nHugh, remained with their mother, farmed a sterile tract on the Black\r\nMountains and trapped bears and wolves through the great southern ranges\r\nof the Appalachian chain. Twice in the year they came down to the hamlet\r\nat Gray Eagle to exchange their peltry for such goods as they needed.\r\nThey were, in short, Grimmel's elder brothers, who sat satisfied in the\r\nchimney-corner while giants, devils and trolls were carousing without.\r\nThey wore the cloth which their mother had spun, woven and made up for\r\nthem. They shot with their father's rifle, ate the same corn-dodgers,\r\nnodded over the same Bible every evening, and drank plenty of whiskey\r\nfrom the same secret still back in the gorge. It had never occurred to\r\nthem to go down into the world, to learn a trade or profession or to\r\nmake money. Why should they? Money was of very little use. They probably\r\ndid not handle twenty dollars in the year, yet they had all they wanted.\r\n\r\nThey were big and slow-moving and serious as the tame bear which lay\r\nbefore the fire. At forty they always spoke of the house and farm as \"my\r\nmother's, Mistress Boyer's,\" and meekly obeyed the old woman as she\r\nordered them about with a sharp tongue. The instinct of kinship was as\r\nstrong in them as in the old Jews. They would strike a bee-line for each\r\nother through the trackless wilderness when miles apart. This happened\r\noften.\r\n\r\n\"How do I know where to find Richard?\" said Hugh. \"I don't know how I\r\nknow. Something in my bones tells me.\"\r\n\r\nI think that when the youngest brother, Peter, left the mountains these\r\nolder men suffered a kind of physical loss ever after, as if an arm or a\r\nleg had been taken from them. Peter was somewhere out in the world,\r\nliving by his wits. God had given him precisely the same kind of wits as\r\nhis brothers, but with a single added drop of uneasy leaven. He tumbled\r\nout of his cradle when he was a baby to see what lay beyond. He was\r\nthin, wizened, restless as a strange beast in a cage, though his\r\nbrothers tirelessly puzzled their slow brains to soothe and satisfy him.\r\nWhen he was a boy he was wretched because he was not taken down into the\r\nvalley or to far-off towns. His brothers were puzzled, dismayed.\r\n\r\n\"It is the bird in the bush he wants,\" said his shrewd old mother. \"The\r\nbird in the bush: he will never get it in his hand.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was a boy of ten a party of geologists stopped at the log hut.\r\nThere was much talk among them of the cities, of science and of\r\npolitics. Peter Boyer thought he had found his bird in the bush.\r\n\r\n\"I must have an education, and a good one, mother,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe was sent to Raleigh to school. Reports came home that no such boy had\r\never been taught there. His fellow-students prophesied that Carolina\r\nwould some day be proud of her gifted son. Up in the mountains the two\r\nbrothers ploughed, trapped, dug ginseng and climbed the peaks for balsam\r\nwith hot, steady zeal to earn the little money which was needed to pay\r\nfor his schooling. The bare cabin grew barer, mother and brothers went\r\nhungry many a day, but the pittance was always saved and sent to him.\r\n\r\nThe boy came home in vacations with his moustache, his gorgeous\r\nscarf-pin and his quick, eager talk: he brought, too, piles of gilded\r\nprize-books, and once a silver medal. He did not care much for books or\r\nmedal, but Richard wrapped each one carefully in paper and packed them\r\nin the big chest, and when the boy was gone the two broad-shouldered men\r\nwould take them out at night and turn them over, and sometimes spell out\r\na page, with a grave awe and delight.\r\n\r\nPresently, the lad sent back their money: he was pushing his own\r\nway--into college, into the University of Virginia, finally--great and\r\nculminating triumph!--into the newspapers. Poems (after Poe, as a matter\r\nof course), political diatribes in Johnsonese periods in _De Bow's\r\nReview_, essays, criticisms,--nothing came amiss to him.\r\n\r\nThe young man's mind was of that flabby but fidgety kind which throws\r\noff ideas as a crab its shells, one after another--useless, imperfect\r\nmoulds of itself. He came home to the mountain-hut in the first flush\r\nand triumph of authorship, bringing every newspaper-clipping in his\r\npocket-book wherein a mention of his name had appeared. Richard, Hugh\r\nand his mother were never tired of hearing nor he of reading them. The\r\npoems and the clippings were left to be stored away--sacred relics--with\r\nthe prize-books and medals. Peter set off to the West.\r\n\r\n\"The bird in the bush is always out of sight with Peter,\" said his\r\nmother, whose hair was growing white and her voice feeble. He became a\r\nlawyer, a Congressman. When he made his first speech (on the snags in\r\nthe Missouri River) he ran down to Carolina with a copy of it in _The\r\nCongressional Globe_. He had grown portly and red-faced, and talked in a\r\nstrident voice. All the towns on his route received him as a conquering\r\nhero. \"The Honorable Peter M. Boyer arrived last night,\" said the\r\npapers, \"and received a magnificent public dinner at the ---- Hotel. The\r\ndistinguished Senator, one of the favorite sons of the Old North State,\r\nis on his way to visit his parents at their summer retreat in Buncombe\r\ncounty.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinguished and pompous Senator, at home in the hut, walked up\r\nand down with uneasy strides and anxious wandering eyes, just as he had\r\ndone when a thin cub of a boy. The Senate Chamber evidently was but as\r\nnarrow a cage for this alien beast as the life of a hunter had been.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not satisfied,\" he told Hugh and Richard. \"Politics are not the\r\nright groove for me. But I'll find it. I know that I have an intellect\r\ndifferent from that of the ordinary man. You can't compare pure gold and\r\nbrass, can you? Well, I've tested those fellows at Washington, and they\r\nare brass: they're pot-metal, sir! My brain,\" tapping his forehead,\r\n\"will tell some day on the world: I'll make my mark. I'll hit the bull's\r\neye yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator went back to Iowa. He was not returned for the next term. In\r\na month or two his mother received a letter from him dated at London.\r\n\"When I succeed,\" he said, \"I will come back to you. I have given up\r\npolitics and taken to literature. Literature is the only career in which\r\nmy brain can reach its full development: all others compress and\r\nconstrain me. I shall seek in the Old World for the recognition which\r\nthe New did not yield me.\" All this was Greek to his mother and her\r\nsons, but they knew that it meant that he was gone.\r\n\r\nHe never came back.\r\n\r\nIn two years the Honorable Peter was as extinct, so far as the American\r\nCongress, newspapers and people were concerned, as any saurian dead\r\nbefore the Flood. His mother died. Peter had always been an alien to\r\nher, a perpetual disquiet. But when he was gone the thorn was out of her\r\nflesh. She talked and thought of him as in his babyhood, and left him\r\nher blessing at the last. As year after year crept by, the twin-brothers\r\nceased to talk of him. But it was because they had begun to think of him\r\nwith that strained, tense attention with which we sit and listen for the\r\nsteps of one who long delays his coming, and who may be dead by the way.\r\n\r\nHe might come back any day, with a crown of glory on his head. Or--was\r\nhe dead? So many ships went down in that dim outer world--so many\r\ncities were burned; legions of men were swept away in battle; in short,\r\nthe millions of graves which dotted the earth's surface only meant to\r\nthese Boyers the one possible grave where he might lie. The gray-headed\r\nold men went stealthily alone at night sometimes to the big chest and\r\nturned over again the poems and essays yellow now with age, and the\r\ngilded prize-books. But they never spoke to each other of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout eighty miles from Black Mountains, in a hamlet on the Nantahela\r\nrange, the whereabouts of Peter Boyer was discussed one July day as a\r\nsubject of more practical interest. All the men in Sevier--a dozen, all\r\ntold--were gathered as usual under the great oak which stood by the pump\r\nin the middle of the square. It was a grassy, weedy square: one or two\r\ncows lay chewing the cud on it, as they did all day long. Why not? There\r\nwas never enough noise in the little street which ran round its four\r\nsides to disturb them. In the evening the women went out and milked them\r\njust where they were: occasionally, a meditative sow with her litter, or\r\na slouching boy, passed them; or a canvas-covered wagon drawn by a steer\r\nwould lumber slowly along, stop, and a woman get out of it with a bag of\r\nginseng or angelica to barter for sugar and shoes; or a farmer in\r\nbutternut homespun would jog up the street on his mule, his gun and bag\r\nof rations strapped behind, on his way to the higher peaks to salt his\r\nwild cattle; or a party of Cherokees from Qualla would come in with\r\nbaskets to sell; or Seth Keen, the dwarf hunter, would bring in a roll\r\nof wolf-skins, and stay to tell his old stories over for the hundredth\r\ntime. But these were rare events: on ordinary days the cows dozed\r\nundisturbed in the sleepy, foggy air, and the men lounged on the trough\r\nby the pump, and smoked from morning until bed-time, and cracked jokes\r\non each other, and told marvellous stories of the war and its ravages.\r\n\r\n\"It giv' Sevier a staggerin' blow, gentlemen,\" old Judge Scroope would\r\nsay: \"we'll never recover from it. I tell you, Jefferson Davis an'\r\nLincoln wur men the country hed no use for. Nor the Almighty neyther.\r\nThat's my cool jedgment, now that we are out of the fracas. Look at the\r\nruin them men wrought around you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd his audience would look around them, and shift their legs, and shake\r\ntheir heads with solemn conviction, though they knew, and he knew that\r\nthey knew, that since North Carolina began to exist the decrepit frame\r\nhouses yonder had turned the same pauper faces to the square in Sevier,\r\nand that their grandfathers in homespun had lounged just as they did on\r\nthis very broken trough, and watched their lean cows chew the cud, and\r\nleisurely abused the Federalists for the ruin of the country. Twice a\r\nyear the judge and Lawyer Grayson rode down to court and crossed the old\r\ntrack of Sherman and his raiders, and coming back would tell of levelled\r\nfences and burned barns. For thirteen years they had gone down, and the\r\nbarns and fences yet lay as Sherman left them, as unchanged as the\r\ngneiss rocks about them.\r\n\r\nOn this day, however, they had a new subject to discuss. The\r\nsheepskin-covered chair which sat by the pump day and night the year\r\nround, ready for the judge, had been empty for two weeks. The old man\r\nhad pneumonia, and was on his deathbed. Every morning the doctor brought\r\na full account of his latest symptoms, and the crowd drearily discussed\r\nthem during the rest of the day over interminable melancholy games of\r\nbackgammon.\r\n\r\nOn this morning Grayson the lawyer had been sent for.\r\n\r\n\"The old gentleman's going to make his will,\" said the doctor, taking a\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThe words were like a chilly wind from the grave. The gossips of Sevier\r\nwere, after all, a simple affectionate folk. They had grown together\r\nlike the mossy logs of their houses: when one was torn away, it left a\r\ngap and a dull, abiding sense of loss for years. There was a long\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"De jedge am bin a class-leader fohty year,\" said at last old Primus the\r\nbarber in the background, shaking his woolly poll.\r\n\r\nNobody answered. The squire noiselessly laid down the dice and shut the\r\nbackgammon-board. Major Fetridge rose with a groan: \"I'll go over and\r\nget a glass of somethin'. Won't some gentleman join me?\"\r\n\r\nNobody joined him. The major's red head and lean little legs moved\r\nunsteadily over the square.\r\n\r\n\"Sam Fetridge hes hed enough a'ready,\" said the squire. \"He'll follow\r\nthe jedge, and that hot foot, ef he don't pull up. D'ye think Dave\r\nCabarreux will come in for all the Scroope proputty, doc?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I--don't--know,\" pulling his beard meditatively. \"It'll\r\nbe left in a lump: that much the jedge told me himself. 'I'll not part\r\nthe proputty,' he says, 'but I'll leave it whar it'll keep up the\r\nstandin' of the family.' The old man always hed his sheer of pride in\r\nthe Scroopes, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dave Cabarreux is his cousin once removed,\" interrupted Bright the\r\nlandlord, who had sauntered back with the major, and engineered that\r\nunsteady worthy to a place on the trough. \"He hes no other kin than\r\nDave, that I know of. David's as genteel a young man as walks Sevier\r\nstreets.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a damned cub!\" The major staggered to his feet, gesticulating\r\nangrily with his trembling hands.\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut, Sam! sit down,\" said the squire, pulling at his coat-tail.\r\n\"You begrudge Dave his pretty little sweetheart. I understand: I've\r\nwatched you. Why, Fetridge, you're old enough to be her father, you\r\nmoon-calf!\"\r\n\r\nSam stiffened his shaky body into a drunken dignity: \"Squire, you can\r\ntalk of me as you choose: every scrag-end of humanity kin take liberties\r\nwith my name now, and does it. But the pump is no place to mention that\r\nlady, nor any lady, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not: that's a fact, Sam. I beg her pardon. But Primus tells\r\nme, gentlemen, that the jedge has been talkin' incessant of his nephew\r\nBoyer. Who's Boyer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heerd the jedge talk of him frequent, sittin' on that very cheer,\"\r\nsaid Byloe the carpenter. \"He's his grand-nephew. Peter Marmyduke Boyer\r\nis the full name. Governor of Iowy. The jedge has told me he was one of\r\nthe first men of the present century. He'd all the genius of the Scroope\r\nfamily. Fact is, I used to think he was a straw man the jedge had made\r\nexpressly to hang the honors of the family on.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the jedge callin' on him now for?\" said the major.\r\n\r\nThe doctor glanced around cautiously to the circle of attentive faces,\r\nthe silent street beyond, the houses that fenced them in: \"It's my\r\nopinion--in strict confidence, gentlemen,\" lowering his voice: the faces\r\ngathered more closely, Sam's, pimpled and eager, the nearest--\"it's my\r\nopinion that the jedge means to cut off Dave without a shilling, and\r\nleave the proputty to this Honorable Peter M. Boyer. But what's the\r\ndifference?\" he continued after waiting a moment to allow the sensation\r\nproduced by his words to subside. \"This man Boyer, they tell me, has not\r\nbeen heard of for years. He didn't even turn up in the war. Undoubtedly,\r\nhe's dead.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Fetridge sank back against the pump with a drunken chuckle: \"Dave\r\nCabarreux thinks that he's dead, hey? Boyer's not the sort of man to die\r\nas long as a good thing like this is in the dice. Why, Boyer's young,\r\nsir. He's got more brains and experience and vitality than all the\r\ndamned wooden Cabarreuxes in a lump.\"\r\n\r\nByloe squirted tobacco-juice skilfully into the puddle between his feet,\r\nand winked at the squire. \"It would go dead ag'in' your chances down at\r\nCalhoun's, major, if Dave gets that proputty,\" he said gravely. \"Old\r\nTony Calhoun is a full-blood Yankee. He'll never give his daughter to a\r\nman with lean pockets.\"\r\n\r\nThe major pulled himself up, half sobered as if by a dash of cold water.\r\n\"And what has Cabarreux to make him fit for her?\" he demanded shrilly.\r\n\"Neither money nor brains. No one of the name ever had energy to earn\r\nsalt to his bread. Cabarreux? Bah-h! Boyer is a man! Why, gentlemen, if\r\nPeter Marmaduke Boyer were to appear in Sevier, it would be like the\r\ncoming of the eagle among the magpies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam, you're drunk,\" said Byloe. \"What d'ye know about the man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Know Boyer?\" He laughed. The major had a peculiar laugh, which always\r\nput the crowd about the pump in a good-humor--a shrill, pleasant cackle\r\nof exultation. \"Why, the whole country knows Boyer. But, if you must\r\nknow it, he was a personal friend of mine. He had a great intellect--a\r\ngi-gantic intellect,\" sweeping the horizon with his arm. \"He represented\r\none of the great Western States in the Senate, Mr. Byloe: ten years ago\r\nhe was known through the length and breadth of the Union as North\r\nCarolina's favorite son. To have asked who was Peter M. Boyer then would\r\nhave argued yourself unknown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam's right,\" said the squire, nodding. \"Now, that you speak of it, I\r\nremember him perfectly well. He had a great reputation as a politician.\r\nThe Raleigh _Herald_ used to publish his speeches _in extenso_. Queer he\r\ntook no part in the war!\"\r\n\r\nThe major chuckled again, delighted: \"He did, sir! he did! Beauregard\r\nhad no braver officer. To see that man lead his command into the teeth\r\nof the Yankees was a spectacle nobody who saw it can ever forget.\" The\r\nlittle man stood up as he talked, gesticulating fiercely as if in the\r\npresence of the foe, his linen coat flapping about his legs, his white\r\nhat set jauntily on one side. \"Ha! those were pleasant days, squire,\"\r\nwiping his forehead in a glow of triumph. \"They brought men up to their\r\nproper level! Boyer was never promoted, though. He was too modest to\r\npush himself, and war was hardly the right groove for him, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"So this great man was a personal friend of yours, Sam?\" asked Byloe\r\nwith another wink and shrug at the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe major nodded: \"Yes. I wasn't always a drunken loafer in Sevier, nor\r\nIke Byloe's companion,\" he said quietly.\r\n\r\nThere was a laugh of applause. The little man, with all his vaporing,\r\nhis windy boasts, his general utter worthlessness, had at bottom a grain\r\nof something genuine which keen Ike Byloe lacked.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of looking man was this Boyer, Sam?\" asked the doctor. \"I\r\nconfess I have a curiosity about the jedge's heir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a fine-looking fellow--every inch a man,\" said the major\r\ncarelessly. \"Voice orotund, magnetic. Easy manners. Good figure;\" and he\r\nwalked up and down complacently, slapping his own shrunk shank. There\r\nhad been a well-shaped leg inside of the ragged linen trousers once, and\r\nthe conscious merit which infused every atom of his lean little body\r\nstill culminated in his strut.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting behind the Balsam Range, and threw a cheerful glow\r\nover the oak and the pump and the little group, when a loose-jointed\r\nfigure came across the fields.\r\n\r\n\"Hyar's Grayson!--Well, colonel, how is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all over, gentlemen. The jedge is gone.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden silence. The men asked no questions, as Northern\r\ngossips would have done. Presently, they got up one by one, with a brief\r\nword or two, and went quietly away to their own houses to close them up,\r\nand to tell madam. The Carolinian \"madam\" may be ugly and shabby and\r\nsilly, but she is usually first in her husband's mind all day.\r\n\r\nNobody was left under the oak but Grayson, the major and Byloe, who was\r\nresolved to solve the mystery of the will.\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose the jedge attended to his earthly affairs before he went off,\r\nColonel Grayson?\" he said.\r\n\r\nGrayson nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Will witnessed, signed--all correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nByloe gave a dolorous cough: \"Folks are talkin' a good deal about Dave\r\nCabarreux as the heir. Dave's the next of kin.\"\r\n\r\nGrayson pushed the ashes into his pipe in imperturbable silence.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ was suggestin' that Boyer had a chance--Governor Boyer of Iowy: Sam\r\nhyar'd prefer him. Ef Dave gits the proputty, he'll take somethin' else\r\nthat Dave's set his heart on, eh?\" chuckling. \"Sam knows Boyer.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer looked up quickly. He said nothing, but Byloe noted the\r\nglance. \"Boyer is the man!\" he thought, and hurried off to tell the\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Mr. Grayson turned to the major: \"Do you really know\r\nthis Boyer, Fetridge? Could you find him if he was wanted?\"\r\n\r\nSam did not answer immediately. He was looking thoughtfully at the\r\nground, his palms resting on his knees. He too supposed that Boyer was\r\nthe heir, and the news had driven all the braggadocio and drunken fire\r\nout of him. What a weak imitation of a man he was, any how! Grayson\r\nthought, looking at him curiously, and wondering what had moved the\r\nfellow so strangely. Was it possible that he hoped to marry Calhoun's\r\nlittle girl if Dave lost this money?\r\n\r\nThe major got up at last, and put on his hat. \"If Peter Boyer is\r\nwanted--that is, if the money is really left to him--I can produce the\r\nman, Grayson,\" he said, and walked slowly away, his head bent and his\r\nhands clasped behind him. The stagey strut was quite gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day after the judge was buried Mr. Calhoun came down in the buggy\r\nfrom the farm to Sevier, Isabel driving. \"I have a new mule in harness,\"\r\nhe explained to the squire, \"and I had to bring Bel to manage him. It's\r\nbad training to use the whip, and he has the temper of the devil. He's\r\nbeyond me, but Bel has her ways of making him go.\"\r\n\r\nThe old squire, looking up at her, his hat in his hand, said gallantly\r\nthere was nothing in Sevier which Miss Isabel couldn't make go; at which\r\nthe little girl laughed, and put her foot in his offered hand to jump\r\ndown from the buggy. There did not seem to be a large amount of\r\npropelling power in her. She had a childish-looking figure, and went\r\nshyly into the store, blushing nervously as she passed the men outside.\r\nThey all stood up and took off their hats, though they did that when any\r\nwoman passed; but one after another, from Colonel Grayson to old Primus,\r\ncontrived afterward to throw himself in her way, to give her a good-day\r\nrespectfully, and have a private glimpse of the beaming face under the\r\nbroad-brimmed brown hat. As soon, too, as it was noised about that\r\nCalhoun's wagon was in town the women all came out to find Isabel.\r\nSevier was dismal enough after the funeral, and needed heartening, and,\r\nas Byloe said, \"That young woman hed spirit enough for all Haywood\r\ncounty.\" Isabel was an intimate friend of every woman in town. Sue\r\nGrayson hurried her in to read her last love-letter, and Mother Byloe\r\nconsulted her about her cherry jam. It was a pity, they thought, that\r\nshe had no beauty--there was always a lamentation on that point when she\r\nwas gone--and the men agreed that she lacked flesh; but Major Fetridge,\r\nwho had known something of the world outside of Sevier in his day, used\r\nto follow her far off to watch her clear, sparkling face. However drunk\r\nhe might be, it sobered him. To-day, as she stood among the village\r\nwomen, whose charms had ripened on the fried meat and black coffee on\r\nwhich they had been fed since babyhood, she reminded him of a fine proof\r\nengraving among cheap chromos.\r\n\r\nHow it was that the little Pennsylvanian moved the mules and sluggish\r\nSevier to life even the major did not know, but it was a fact that she\r\nalways left the village more awake and happier than she found it. It was\r\nas if one had sung a stirring song in the market-place.\r\n\r\nAs she drove away to-day the squire looked after her admiringly. \"I\r\nheard you were going to send her North, Mr. Calhoun?\" he said to the\r\npaunchy, brisk little man beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" pulling his black moustache. \"Fact is, this is no place for\r\nIsabel, squire. She has no mother: I have to think for the child. She\r\nhas kinsfolk in New England, and I'll send her there for a year or two.\r\nTo tell you the truth, I can't see her mated with one of these loggish\r\nyoung ploughmen about Sevier.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Cabarreux?\" said the squire with a significant nod.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I mean Cabarreux. 'Twon't do, squire. I've forbidden her to see\r\nhim again. Well, what d'ye think of sending her away? I meant to ask\r\nyour advice about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe squire was more intimate with Mr. Calhoun than any of the other men\r\nin Sevier; but it was the Northerner's practice to take counsel with\r\nthem all concerning his endless schemes: he was a friendly, social\r\nfellow, and liked to hear himself explain his plans--just the man to\r\nbuttonhole Charon in his boat and get a useful hint or two from him\r\nabout the other side. The people of Sevier liked Calhoun, but were a\r\nlittle afraid of him. His education and mind, they knew, were no better\r\nthan theirs; his manners were not as good; but a man who, with but a\r\nhundred dollars in his pocket, could camp down in the woods and evolve\r\nout of the bare earth a farm, a mill, a mica-mine, a house with comforts\r\nand luxuries such as Sevier had never dreamed of, had a quality which\r\nstunned and awed them. A man may know how common are the iron and steel\r\nand coal that go to make up a steam-engine, but none the less does the\r\nmysterious force inside make him stand out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe squire and Mr. Calhoun sauntered down the street. \"I'll not deny,\"\r\nsaid the old man, meditatively, \"that Cabarreux has no Northern 'go' in\r\nhim. But Dave's a good-natured fellow. He fought like the devil thar in\r\nthe Wilderness, and him but sixteen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and has done nothing since but think of it. Oh, I've no objections\r\nto Carbarreux except that he's of no account: he'll never earn his\r\nbread. I can't see my girl starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'd be a fine-looking couple,\" persisted the squire, whose heart\r\nleaned toward the young people. \"Dave stands a good chance for the\r\njedge's property, too. We'll know to-night: the will's to be read this\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun stopped: \"I'll acknowledge, squire, that would make a\r\ndifference--that would undoubtedly make a difference. I'm a practical\r\nman. Cabarreux with a steady income would be a dead weight which Bel\r\nmight manage to shove along through the world; but Cabarreux with\r\nnothing is a millstone which would grind her to powder. I'd made up my\r\nmind to send her away next week. But if you think--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay in town until we hear. The will's to be read to-night. Come and\r\ndine with me: the madam has corned beef and succotash to-day.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIsabel drove briskly along the mountain-road. When she came to the forks\r\nshe stopped and hesitated: either way would take her home--one in half\r\nan hour, the other after a long circuit among the hills. She turned the\r\nmule's head into the longer road, a red flush rising suddenly on her\r\ndelicate neck and face. For an hour the narrow path climbed the\r\nmountain-side, then dipped abruptly into the valley. Isabel looked\r\neagerly down the gorge; her breath came quickly; she began to sing\r\nsoftly to herself. Yet there was nothing in sight but a little clearing\r\nin the vast stretch of sombre, uninhabited forest, a vacant log house, a\r\nhalf-built barn.\r\n\r\nThis was the place which Dave Cabarreux's father had given him years\r\nago, and which she had heard he was going to work next spring. He would\r\nbe drudging here while she was in the North, thinking of her as he\r\nploughed: she knew that. But she would be gone for ever. It would be all\r\nover then. Isabel stopped the mule, and sat with her hands clasped on\r\nher knees, looking at the meadow and the desolate closed house. It was\r\nnobly done in David to give himself up to hard work. Her heart beat as\r\nhigh with pride as if he had been the first man who ever undertook at a\r\nlate day to earn his living. She had heard in town that he had been down\r\nlooking at the place the day before. Perhaps he had walked over that\r\nvery meadow. She leaned forward: the ground was soft: surely there were\r\nthe marks of footsteps. Only yesterday! Isabel glanced quickly\r\naround--at the lonely road, the mighty hills that shut her in, swathed\r\nin forest, shouldering the clouds, the gray mist creeping through the\r\ngorge. An eagle swept across the opening overhead, frogs croaked in the\r\nswamp yonder: there were no other living things to see her. She sprang\r\nfrom the wagon, ran across the meadow, put her foot in the deep print:\r\nher bosom heaved, the tears came to her eyes. Isabel was not a\r\nsentimental, silly girl, but a shrewd, hard-working woman. She had not\r\nseen her lover for a long time, and she thought it would be years before\r\nshe would see him again.\r\n\r\nShe walked down to the river--sat down under a walnut tree. Surely she\r\nmight rest there a minute. She would never see David's home again.\r\n\r\nA tall, dark man gathered himself up from among the deep fern, watching\r\nher breathlessly. Was it possible that she cared to walk over the land\r\nbecause it was _his_ land? No: she was too cold-blooded a little thing\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Isabel!\"\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet. It was he! Then she spoke coolly, precisely as\r\nif they had met on the street in Sevier: \"How did you come here, Mr.\r\nCabarreux? I thought there was nobody but myself in this valley.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Cabarreux stood leaning over her, his hat in his hand: \"The truth\r\nis, I was asleep by the branch thar. I came out to look into the quality\r\nof the soil this mornin', but I took a rest instead: I'll have enough of\r\nwork hyar next year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you will,\" with a little sigh, and a quick glance of pity at the\r\nwell-knit, handsome figure.\r\n\r\nCabarreux colored high and hesitated: \"You--you knew it was my land,\r\nthen, Miss Isabel? When you stopped?\" He bent so close that she could\r\nfeel his breath stir her hair. What could she say? She had never let him\r\nknow that she cared for him so much as that. She gave a frightened\r\nglance at the face above her, the mellow olive complexion, the laughing\r\nmouth, the dark, liquid eyes. It seemed to her that one of the early\r\ngods might have had such a face.\r\n\r\n\"I had heard--I thought you had a farm in this valley,\" she faltered,\r\nmoving away.\r\n\r\nCabarreux did not press the question: he followed her, moving the\r\nbranches aside with patient courtesy. He was a sincere man, and he\r\nloved the girl with all his strength. _Did_ she care for him? He would\r\nknow now.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, clearing the dead leaves from a mossy log. \"Will you sit\r\ndown?\" he said with a certain stately grace which even his baggy,\r\nhomespun clothes and torn hat did not make absurd. \"It _is_ my land, and\r\nit would seem always different to me if you'd rest on it for a minute,\r\nMiss Isabel.\"\r\n\r\nIsabel sat down. The color glowed hot in her face, and her lips moved\r\nunsteadily as she tried to talk. \"The laurel blooms late in this gorge,\"\r\nshe said. \"Look at the bush by the rock.\"\r\n\r\nBut Cabarreux did not look at the laurel: he did not know what she said.\r\nHe stood immovable before her, his sultry eyes lazily reading her face.\r\nThere was deep quiet in the little valley, except when a fish leaped in\r\nthe water beside them or the call of a mocking-bird rang through the\r\nwoods. They had never before, as it happened, been quite alone together.\r\nNow this great silence and solitude shut them in.\r\n\r\nHe stood erect at last with a long breath. \"There is somethin' I've\r\nwished to say to you for a long time,\" he began in his leisurely drawl.\r\n\r\nShe stood up pale and fluttering. If she were the man! If she could\r\nspeak! She would compel love, she would force confession by sheer\r\nstrength of words. But Cabarreux stood deferential, indolent. \"I must go\r\nhome: it is late,\" she said, hurrying across the field.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, Miss Isabel. This will be my home,\" stopping by the porch\r\nof the little house. \"If you would only look at it or walk through it\r\nonce--just once! It will be something for me to remember--when you are\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone? This was the last time. She went hesitatingly up on\r\nto the porch, and stood in the empty room by the bare hearth, Cabarreux\r\nbeside her. Once or twice he tried to speak, but the words died on his\r\nlips: when he gave her his hand as she went down the steps his fingers\r\nwere icy cold and trembled. Perhaps she guessed the pain that the man\r\nfelt at the time, and was quite willing that he should feel it. She\r\nsaid coolly as they walked through the woods to the road, \"It's quite a\r\npretty little house, and this is very good soil indeed. I shall think of\r\nyou as very comfortable here, Mr. Cabarreux, when I am in the North.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you are in the North? Great God! do you know what you are sayin'?\r\nStay! you shall hear me! It's a poor hovel--I know how wretched it looks\r\nin your Northern eyes--but as I lay there this morning I was\r\nplannin'--plannin' how to make a palace of it for you--for you. Why, I'd\r\nwork like a slave--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short. Dave Cabarreux had never done an honest stroke of work\r\nin his life. Nothing but planning. He remembered that in this imminent\r\nmoment, and laughed. \"Miss Isabel, I've been a good-for-nothing dog:\r\nthat's the truth. Everybody knows it: you know it. But there's a woman\r\nthat I love who could put a new soul into my body. If she would.\"\r\n\r\nThey had halted by the fence now, and Isabel's hand was on the mossy\r\nrail. He put his own over it. \"If she would? Isabel, do you care for\r\nme--at all?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at the dark face full of tenderness and power. It seemed\r\nas if the gods were coming very close to her indeed. \"Yes, I care for\r\nyou,\" she said gently. \"But I must go home--I must have time--I will not\r\nhear more to-day.\"\r\n\r\nBut she waited to hear more. He only stooped and reverently kissed her\r\nlips without a word. His brain reeled as it had done when he was going\r\ninto battle in the Wilderness. He had never worked, but he would--to win\r\nher! He had not borne himself so badly in that other fight.\r\n\r\nHe lifted her into the buggy and walked beside her, his hand on the\r\nreins, as the mule crept drowsily along the five miles between the\r\nvalley and the Calhoun farm. He spoke little. He was in a rapturous\r\ndream, in which the warm sunlight, the woods, the soft fingers which he\r\ntouched now and then, bore a part.\r\n\r\nIsabel talked or sang softly to herself, as she always did when she was\r\nhappy. Once he heard her say, \"I should try oats in that meadow, if I\r\nwere you. And I should not be surprised if corundum could be found in\r\nthose rocks back of the house.\"\r\n\r\nOats and corundum?\r\n\r\nTears of vexation stood in her eyes as he looked at her perplexed. \"It\r\nis the farm I mean. You don't seem to have heard me. My father is so\r\npractical! Indeed, indeed, it is only by hard work that you can gain his\r\nconsent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand perfectly,\" gazing dreamily into her eyes. \"I shall go\r\nto work upon that place: I shall tear it all up--next spring.\" He walked\r\non beside her. The golden light deepened in the west; the air was full\r\nof delicious resinous odors from the pine forest; now and then he\r\npressed his lips to the warm, rose-tinted hand. Surely, he thought, this\r\ndivine draught which they had just begun to taste was not as sweet to\r\nher as he found it, or she would not care to talk of oats and corundum.\r\n\r\nWhen he left her he sauntered leisurely up the mountain wrapt in a\r\ndelirious ecstasy. Suddenly he quickened his steps: \"I must go and hear\r\nUncle Scroope's will. A chance of something thar. No need of grubbing\r\nout my life then in that old sheep-pasture.\" But he soon slackened his\r\npace again, thinking with a glow of exultation how true and tender he\r\nwould be to his love--how he could fight for her if need be. He wished\r\nthere were some foes to fight. No doubt if there had been, Dave would\r\nhave done his devoir, for he was as gallant a gentleman as any Sidney of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nIsabel sat on the porch alone that evening. The women, with the men,\r\nwere at work ploughing corn on the upland, and her father would not\r\nreturn from Sevier until late. The sun was going down, throwing the\r\nshadow of a great peak of the Balsam Range over the house and the neat\r\nfarm with its Pennsylvania barn and fences. High up on the mountain\r\nheaps of mica outside of the gaping black mouth of a deserted mine\r\nglistened like silver.\r\n\r\nA queer little figure was coming up the lonely road. Isabel saw it, and\r\nlaughed. Nobody could mistake the consequential strut, the flapping\r\nlinen suit, the white hat with its band of crape. But Isabel was in a\r\nhappy, tender mood toward all the world to-night; and she had always\r\nbeen gentle with the poor little major. She only, of all the people in\r\nSevier, saw beneath the drunken braggart a man who had been sorely\r\nworsted, and that perhaps not fairly, in the long fight. He was quite\r\nsober this evening. But as she rose to meet him she saw signs of an odd\r\nchange in him. The linen clothes were scrupulously clean, costly ruby\r\nbuttons blazed in his shirt-front, on his fore finger was a curious\r\nantique ring never seen there before: the usual defiant jauntiness of\r\nthe man had given way to a more significant self-assertion, as if he had\r\nat last found secure ground beneath his feet.\r\n\r\n\"My father is not at home, Major Fetridge: I am sorry,\" said Isabel,\r\noffering him a chair.\r\n\r\nBut he remained standing, leaning airily against a pillar, looking down\r\nat her. \"_I_ am not sorry, Miss Calhoun. It was you that I came to see,\"\r\nhe said pointedly. A nervous smile showed his teeth; his pale blue eyes\r\nshone: the little man was, she saw, aflame with some secret exultation\r\nas with wine.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy that you bring me good news, major?\" said Isabel, humoring his\r\nmood.\r\n\r\n\"News? Yes, I bring you news. The will is read--Judge Scroope's will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the heir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter Marmaduke Boyer, if he is alive. If he is dead, young Cabarreux.\"\r\n\r\nIsabel made no reply for a moment: the work she held fell from her hand.\r\nShe had not known of this chance. If David Cabarreux were the heir he\r\nwould have every virtue in her father's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" she said at last, taking up her work again with a soft,\r\ncomplacent little laugh, \"Mr. Cabarreux may live long to enjoy his good\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fortune is not his,\" cried Sam excitedly. \"You don't understand.\r\nBoyer is the heir--the Honorable Peter M. Boyer. A man who stood in the\r\nSenate of the United States, Miss Calhoun. A man who knows the\r\nworld--who will know how to give his wife place and power, and who will\r\nhave money now to buy both.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said he was dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I--\" He paused, grew suddenly pale, and went on hurriedly: \"I know\r\nthe man. He is alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--It does not matter. It is all just as it was before,\" said Isabel\r\nwith a proud smile. But, her thoughts going to her lover in his\r\ndisappointment, she almost forgot that the major was there until he\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\nHis altered tone startled her into attention. It was sharp with\r\nrepressed passion and pain. The poor sot was in earnest--more in\r\nearnest, it seemed to her, even than Cabarreux had been when he had told\r\nher that he loved her to-day. \"Miss Calhoun, do you remember one day\r\nthree or four years ago, when I was knocked down in a drunken fight at\r\nSevier, and lay like a beast on the roadside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Major Fetridge--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! I must tell you: I never spoke to you about it before. You passed\r\nby. You were a little thing then--the people in Sevier had left me there\r\nlike a dead dog--but you tried to rouse me, to take me home; and when\r\nyou could not do it, you spread your handkerchief over my face to hide\r\nit. I have it yet. Look there! Such a scrap of a thing!\" opening it out.\r\n\r\n\"Any girl would have done it. Why do you bring up this miserable story\r\nnow?\" cried Isabel.\r\n\r\n\"Because on that day I swore before Almighty God that if ever I reached\r\nmy place in the world you should stand beside me. Oh!\" pacing up and\r\ndown with a bitter laugh, \"I wasn't always the drunken bummer Sam\r\nFetridge. I have within me great capabilities--even yet, yet. _You_ saw\r\nthat. You saw the man I might have been, and never was. Every word you\r\nhave ever spoken to me has showed me that you saw it.\"\r\n\r\nThe words and the uncontrollable excitement of the man had a singular\r\neffect upon Isabel. Something in the voice, the words, came from a\r\nstrong soul in desperate strait--belonged to a man with intellect and\r\nenergy, for whom she could have near sympathy, a sense of alliance; but\r\nbefore her eyes was only ridiculous Sam Fetridge, the butt of the\r\nvillage, vaporing up and down.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" she said frankly, \"that your life in Sevier has been\r\nwretched enough. I thank God that you are going to change it. What can I\r\ndo to help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know? Don't you understand even yet?\" The little man came up\r\nbefore her and took both her hands in his: the tears stood in his\r\nblinking eyes. Isabel looked into them steadily, and she did not take\r\nher hands away. \"You see it is a sort of crisis to-night with me, Miss\r\nCalhoun. I've thought for a good while the game was played out for body\r\nand soul. But there's one thing that could make a man of me again, and\r\nto-night I feel as if I had some right to put out my hand and take it.\"\r\n\r\nHer lips moved, but she said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"It is your love. I've loved you a long time. I'm old enough to be your\r\nfather, but I never loved any woman but you, Isabel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you meant that,\" she said under her breath.\r\n\r\n\"It is not drunken Sam Fetridge that loves you. I have culture,\r\nintelligence, energy. I am a better man at bottom than Dave Cabarreux,\r\nand one nearer akin to yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love him: I do not love you.\" She said it mechanically, her eyes\r\nfixed on his with a frightened, curious look of recognition. It followed\r\nhim as he left her, half staggering across the porch: it was on him\r\nstill as he came back, and, leaning against the pillar, held out his\r\nhand again to her.\r\n\r\nShe did not take it now.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Calhoun, there is not in the United States a man with more\r\nambition than I have, nor one with a better chance to take his place\r\namong other men if--if I had your hand to hold. Give it to me: be my\r\nwife. For God's sake, don't take the chance from me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Major Fetridge,\" she said resolutely, but with a strange quaver in her\r\nvoice, \"I love David Cabarreux. I never can marry you. If there is\r\nanything else that I can do--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there is nothing you can do,\" he cried vehemently. \"It would have\r\nbeen better you had thought me a drunken brute like the others, and had\r\nnot recognized me. For you did recognize me, you know.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned without another word, and walked down the hill with slouching\r\nstep and head bent. Isabel tried to think of him as the tippling major,\r\nbut it seemed as if she had talked to another man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun met Major Fetridge as he came home, but he was in an\r\nill-humor and did not speak to him. Late that evening Sam lay on a bench\r\nby the pump. He had been drinking heavily, but he was sober. The squire\r\nand Grayson were discussing the event of the day, the will.\r\n\r\n\"Calhoun is savagely disappointed,\" said the squire. \"If Cabarreux had\r\nhad the money, he would have allowed him to marry Isabel, he says. Now\r\nhe means to send her North at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure that this Boyer is alive?\" said Grayson.\r\n\r\n\"Sam says so. He says he is going to bring the man up soon. Well, it's\r\nall up with poor Cabarreux. I'm sorry for them. Bel is a good girl: she\r\nought to have been a happy wife.\"\r\n\r\nThe men went home to bed, leaving the major on the bench. He lay there\r\nfor an hour or more. The village had gone to sleep for the night. Dense\r\nfogs wrapped the mountains that shut in the little hamlet, but overhead\r\nthe stars were shining in the near heaven.\r\n\r\nHe rose at last. He was ghastly pale, as if the blood had ceased to flow\r\nin his body, but he stood up, drawing himself to his little height with\r\na sudden triumph. \"Damned if I don't do it! the time has come for the\r\ngreat deed!\" He went with a swagger, as though he walked on air, down\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nTwo days later young Cabarreux, sauntering leisurely, as usual, across\r\nthe square, met the squire and Sam Fetridge coming out of Grayson's\r\noffice. Both men were greatly excited, but Sam was silent, while the\r\nsquire talked volubly. He grasped Dave by the hand: \"Cabarreux, I\r\ncongratulate you! You are a lucky dog! I was just saying to Fetridge\r\nhyar, 'What is there that fellow hasn't got?'\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? what have I got?\" said Cabarreux.\r\n\r\n\"The major here hes heerd about that fellow Boyer. He's dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this true?\" turning to Fetridge.\r\n\r\nThe major did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's true,\" said the squire. \"Sam has the letter in his\r\npocket.--Show it to him, Fetridge.\"\r\n\r\nSam looked up at the handsome, eager face for a full moment. \"Boyer is\r\ndead,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The proputty's yours, Cabarreux,\" cried the squire.--\"By George, he's\r\noff already! Straight for the Calhoun farm! Thar will be as fine a\r\ncouple as there is in Carolina. Come, let's drink their health, major.\r\nI'll stand treat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink their health? No. Good-night. I'm going out of town a bit,\" he\r\nreplied, nodding shortly; and without another word of farewell he turned\r\nhis back on Sevier for ever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no couple better beloved in all that mountain-region than David\r\nCabarreux and his wife. They live on the farm. Dave lies in the fern a\r\ngood part of every day smoking and planning, but as his wife is\r\nsatisfied that his dream is one of love for her, she is content:\r\nbesides, she wishes him to rest, being careful of his health and in\r\nconstant terror lest he may fall a victim to cerebral disease from\r\noverwork, which is so common an ailment in the North. Oats and corundum\r\nboth came according to prophecy. The Cabarreux property is turning out\r\nbetter than any other in that part of the State, both as to soil and\r\nmineral products: there is some talk of a gold-mine, indeed, lately.\r\n\r\n\"And Bel,\" her father tells the squire, \"will find out the latest\r\nimprovements in working it. Bel can bring the best profit out of any\r\nground, however poor. Even out of Cabarreux himself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun is a little prejudiced still against his Southern\r\nson-in-law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeter Marmaduke Boyer is dead. He died at home, in the mountain-hut. The\r\nway it came about was this: The two brothers sat alone one night by the\r\nfire after a day's hunting. Suddenly Richard stood up. His practised ear\r\nheard a step far off down the mountain. Then Hugh rose: they looked at\r\neach other. \"It is he,\" they said, and went out into the night to meet\r\nhim. Their watch of half a lifetime was over.\r\n\r\nTheir brother, when they brought him into the house, was very poor and\r\nweak, and looked as if he were an older man than either of them. But he\r\nwas full of triumph and good cheer.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" he said, \"I told you I would not come back to you until I had\r\ndone a great deed. I have done it.\"\r\n\r\nHe never told them what it was, and they were contented with knowing\r\nthat he had taken rank above all other men down in the great world\r\nyonder.\r\n\r\nHe lived for more than a year. It was a very happy year. The brothers\r\nhad waited long for it. They listened from morning until night to his\r\nboastful little stories with undoubting faith and pleasure. As for their\r\nhero, he felt that he had made his mark: he had his circle of admirers\r\nand limitless applause: what could life give him more?\r\n\r\nThe little man wasted away gradually. Just at the last he looked up with\r\nan assuring nod to Richard and Hugh: \"You'll not be long behind me,\r\nboys. But I'll be there before: I'll straighten matters a bit for you.\"\r\nAnd so he went out with an airy swagger into the other world.\r\n\r\n     REBECCA HARDING DAVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY AT TANTAH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tantah, a town of Lower Egypt, in the Delta province and 5 miles S. W.\r\nof Menoof, on the Damietta branch of the Nile. It has a government\r\nschool.\"\r\n\r\nThis, and nothing more, from the _Gazetteer_. It does not promise much,\r\nand yet Tantah is an important place, and, in spite of the _Gazetteer_,\r\nis _not_ on the Damietta branch, but in the very heart of the Delta,\r\namong the smaller water-courses. On this account it is not often visited\r\nby travellers.\r\n\r\nAnd first I must tell how I came to go to Tantah. In the year 1867 the\r\nsloop-of-war ----, to which I was attached, was cruising in the Levant,\r\ntouching now and again at Canea or at Suda Bay to see how the Turks and\r\nthe Cretans were getting on with their war, or at Larneka to lend the\r\n\"influence of the flag\" to that pleasant gentleman, General di Cesnola,\r\nthen in the full tide of archaeological research in Cyprus. Sometimes we\r\nwere sipping fruity wine in Samos or eating \"lumps of delight\" and\r\nsmoking Latakia in Smyrna; and generally we represented the United\r\nStates in these uttermost parts with great dignity.\r\n\r\nOne day while at Smyrna we received orders by the mail-steamer to go at\r\nonce to Jaffa, and there afford assistance to certain \"distressed\r\nAmericans\" then sojourning on the Plain of Sharon. We already knew\r\nsomething about them. These people were the remains--the _sediment_, so\r\nto speak--of a certain \"American colony\" which had come out from New\r\nEngland, principally from Maine and New Hampshire, a year or two before,\r\nbeing the latest crusaders on record, and \"bound to occupy the land\" on\r\nthe way to the Holy City. They had some kind of queer, fanatical belief,\r\nwhich had been fostered by their leader, one Adams, a long, raw-boned,\r\nbearded Yankee, until they sold their farms or shops and tools of trade,\r\nand placed the proceeds in a common stock under the charge of their\r\nprophet and leader. This Adams was said to have formerly been an actor,\r\nand then a Methodist minister in St. Louis, a Mormon (some people said)\r\nafter that; and finally he had invented a creed and founded a sect of\r\nhis own. It does not speak very well for the vaunted New England\r\nshrewdness and intelligence that near two hundred and fifty persons of\r\nall ages cast in their lot with him, or, rather, cast in their lots for\r\nhim. He chartered a vessel, freighted it with provisions, seed for\r\nplanting, agricultural implements and lumber for houses, and forthwith\r\nsailed for the Holy Land at the head of his followers, intending to sow\r\nand reap and prepare for the coming of the nations at the millennium,\r\nsupposed by the colonists to be near at hand. Such people are apt to be\r\nuseful so long as their enthusiasm lasts, whatever the motives which\r\nprompt them. This even the Turks could see; and a firman had been\r\nprocured without difficulty, enabling them to erect their houses and to\r\nlease and cultivate a certain portion of land, planting American\r\nseed-wheat and maize where before grew only _gran turco_, barley,\r\nsesamum and anise.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that there was to be seen the curious contrast of\r\nstaring Yankee frame houses and a regulation \"meeting-house\" peeping\r\nover the orange-groves of Jaffa. Yankee-built farm-wagons passed along\r\nthe dusty cactus-hedged lanes in company with panniered donkeys and\r\nladen camels, while Yankee forms and voices were daily seen and heard in\r\nthe filthy narrow streets of the old town itself. I wonder how much\r\nthese simple, homely people knew of Roman assaults and massacres or of\r\nNapoleon's butcheries enacted on the very ground where their\r\nhearthstones were laid? Not much, I fancy. And it was hard to get them\r\nto talk freely or connectedly on any subject. In fact, their experience\r\nhad not been happy; and by this time the Plain of Sharon was dust and\r\nashes to them, and \"their dolls were stuffed with sawdust.\" Some of the\r\nyounger members of the community did confess to a passing knowledge of\r\nJonah and the whale, and of the ships which brought the cedar of Lebanon\r\nto the port where their lot was cast; but they seemed as much at sea as\r\nJonah was when the Crusades were mentioned. At any rate, here was this\r\nAmerican-born community ploughing this historic soil, most of the\r\nmembers of which had never been fifty miles from home before they took\r\nthis great blind leap into the dark.\r\n\r\nI never knew just how much Adams believed in himself and his mission. On\r\na previous visit, while all was still _couleur de rose_ with the colony,\r\nI had asked him how he proposed to keep order among his flock and to\r\nsettle the disputes and difficulties which must inevitably arise. \"Why,\r\nsir,\" he answered, \"we have no disputes; but should any arise, I, with\r\nthe elders, will sit and judge them in the gate, just as in Bible\r\ntimes--just as was done right here twenty-five centuries ago.\"\r\n\r\nWe found matters sadly changed since our visit of the year before. It\r\nwas now almost harvest-time, and there was little to reap, for little\r\nhad been planted. Many of the colonists had fallen sick, and not a few\r\nhad laid their bones under the strange soil to mingle with the dust of\r\nages. Some had been assisted to return to their Western home by a\r\nbenevolent member of the party whose pilgrimage is immortalized by Mark\r\nTwain in the _Innocents Abroad_. Some who had privately and wisely\r\nretained a small sum for a \"rainy day\" had gone off, abandoning their\r\ninterest in the common weal. But many had, in the inception, with\r\nunquestioning faith, placed their all in the common stock, and were\r\nunable to extract any part thereof from the custody of Adams, who not\r\nonly did not account for the funds, but by this time had taken to drink,\r\nand was generally to be seen (when to be seen at all) in a state either\r\nof maudlin piety or of morose defiance of all questions and demands. Of\r\ncourse, under these circumstances the business-affairs of the colony\r\nwent to rack and ruin. The small number of his disciples who remained\r\nwere suffering from want of comforts and from malaria, home-sickness and\r\ndisappointment. One or two of the women had taken to themselves Syrian\r\nhusbands, and one or two of the men, with Yankee readiness and\r\nadaptation where a penny was to be turned, had taken to \"guiding\"\r\ntravellers to Jerusalem or trading in horseflesh; but nearly all of\r\nthose who were left were longing for \"home,\" and would be glad to get\r\nthere on any terms.\r\n\r\nIt was determined very soon after our arrival, in spite of Adams's\r\ncovert opposition, that those who wished to leave should be taken on\r\nboard our ship and transported to Alexandria, whence they could be sent\r\nby the consul to Liverpool as \"distressed American citizens,\" and thence\r\nto America. Poor people! they had little to bring on board but the\r\nclothes in which they stood--well worn and mended, but generally clean\r\nand decent. Some few had modest bundles, and the younger women had even\r\nretained a little personal finery. Indeed, the women and girls all\r\nshowed in their deportment much of the self-respect and quaint good\r\nmanners due to their New England birth and training. These were all\r\nprovided with private quarters for the short passage in the cabin and\r\nwardroom. The men were quartered upon the different messes among the\r\ncrew, and they seemed to have suffered more degradation in their fallen\r\nfortunes than the women. Among the males was to be seen an occasional\r\n_tarboush_ or a pair of baggy trousers and sash; and it was curious to\r\nobserve how the wearers of these garments had acquired a loaferish,\r\n_farniente_ air worthy of a native. Our officers and men did what they\r\ncould toward assisting these poor people with spare clothing and a\r\nlittle cash. They seemed, however, to move about in a kind of daze,\r\nreceiving the contributions properly enough, but in a quiet,\r\nundemonstrative kind of way; so different from the usual _backsheesh_\r\ntransactions to which we were accustomed in this part of the world that\r\nthe contrast of itself would have proclaimed them a foreign race. In\r\none or two cases the women, as soon as they found out what was going on,\r\nmade a private request that any cash intended for them might be put into\r\ntheir own hands, \"their men bein' kind of shiftless-like, you see.\"\r\n\r\nA quiet run of thirty hours brought us to the busy port of Alexandria,\r\nwhere the crowded harbor and the rush and bustle of the Overland traffic\r\nand travel caused a turmoil to which we had been for months\r\nunaccustomed. It must have been fairly bewildering to our passengers,\r\nfresh from their humdrum existence. The arrangements on their behalf\r\nwere made in a few hours, and our poor fellow-countrymen were soon off\r\nfor England in the steerage of a huge cotton-loaded freight-steamer,\r\nhaving a new experience in the companionship of Bengalese, Maltese,\r\nArabs, English navvies and riff-raff of all tongues and complexions. In\r\nfact, the Overland route, at that time especially, afforded about the\r\nmost curious aggregation of nationalities and costumes that the world\r\nhas ever seen since the Crusades.\r\n\r\n\"It is an ill wind which blows nobody good.\" We had earnestly desired,\r\nduring two terms of service in the Levant, to visit Egypt, but some\r\nuntoward event had always prevented us from doing so. A threatened\r\nmassacre at Damascus, some consul's squabble at Sidon or Haiffa, or some\r\nfresh atrocity reported in the course of the Cretan insurrection, or the\r\ndesire on the part of our minister to have \"the flag shown\" at\r\nConstantinople, had invariably barred us from getting to the south. But\r\nhere we were at last within sight of Pompey's Pillar, and we felt sure\r\nthat we should not leave the East again, as we had done once before,\r\nwithout a peep at the Pyramids, and at least a glance at the wonderful\r\nwork of M. de Lesseps, then approaching completion.\r\n\r\nOn the day after our arrival, while dining with our consul-general, the\r\ngreat fair then being held at Tantah became the subject of conversation.\r\nAs most of us had never even heard of Tantah, we were informed that it\r\nwas a large and flourishing town in the Delta, about halfway between\r\nAlexandria and Cairo, where an annual fair--_the_ fair of Egypt--had\r\nbeen held time out of mind. That is, out of modern Egyptian mind, which,\r\nin strange contrast with its belongings and residence, does not seem to\r\nremember anything much before the last harvest, the last hatching of\r\neggs and the last conscription. Lately, the fair had been interdicted by\r\nthe viceroy on account of cholera having been introduced by the pilgrims\r\nreturning from Mecca and Jeddah, and then spread by the multitude which\r\ncongregated there; for the fair was held just at the time that the\r\npilgrims returned from the \"Hadj,\" and hadjis, as a rule, are not averse\r\nto dealing and turning an honest penny.\r\n\r\nThis year, however, the fair was in full blast again, and more\r\nfrequented than ever on account of its temporary suspension. To this\r\npoint were drawn not only the Fellahs of the surrounding Delta, but\r\nNubians, Soudanese and Copts from the south; Arabs from across the Red\r\nSea and from Fezzan and Tripoli; Mograbs on their western way from the\r\nHadj; Turks from Aleppo, Broussa and Constantinople; Greeks, both\r\nHellenes and Fanariots; Maltese, Italians and Syrians; Armenians and\r\nJews. The time was late in April, and the weather already very hot, so\r\nthat the tribe of winter Nile travellers would be conspicuous by its\r\nabsence, and visitors to the fair would be spared their airs and graces,\r\nand have an opportunity to enjoy a scene of genuine local color without\r\na pervading sense of tourists to spoil it.\r\n\r\nThe consul-general kindly proposed that we should make up a party for\r\nthe next day, undertaking to procure a vice-regal order (Ismail was not\r\nyet khedive) for a special car to be attached to the morning-train, wait\r\nfor us, and bring us back to Alexandria in the evening. The\r\nconsuls-general of Russia and Belgium, who were present, volunteered to\r\njoin the party. Each of them, as well as our own consul, was to be\r\nattended by his two _cavasses_--magnificent persons in costume gay with\r\ncolor and lace, and bristling with weapons; in addition to which they\r\ncarried in the hand a long and heavy rod.\r\n\r\nWe reached Tantah before nine o'clock, and emerged from the station\r\nunder the close inspection of a motley crowd of loafers, to find the\r\nday, as usual, splendidly clear and bright, but already too hot for\r\ncomfort. The American vice-consul was in waiting to receive us--a Syrian\r\nmerchant of some substance, whose office was a sinecure, and who spoke\r\nno word of English, but to whom the position was of much importance as a\r\nprotection from any petty persecution of the local authorities. He\r\nseemed to be quite overwhelmed by the honor done him by the visit, which\r\nwould add immensely to his social and business standing.\r\n\r\nForming a sort of procession, we walked slowly toward the centre of the\r\ntown, preceded by the six cavasses, who shouted to the motley crowd to\r\nmake way for their high lordships, and when the promptest obedience was\r\nnot rendered whacked the offenders with their canes with great\r\nimpartiality and no light hand. Hardly a curse or a scowl resulted from\r\nthis treatment, the crowd mostly seeming to take the stick discipline as\r\na joke.\r\n\r\nThe town of Tantah is, for Egypt, a very modern place, on flat ground of\r\ncourse, containing the usual bazaars, mosques, barracks and pasha's\r\nresidence or konak, with some substantial private buildings near the\r\ncentre, from which the houses soon dwindle to the ordinary mud residence\r\nof the Fellah. The place was said to contain some fifty or sixty\r\nthousand people, while more than double that number was just now drawn\r\nto it by the fair.\r\n\r\nThe vice-consul, swelling with pride and shiny with perspiration, led us\r\nstraight to his residence, a large house in one of the principal\r\nstreets. Here we had breakfast, with coffee and pipes, which occupied an\r\nhour, the whole large establishment seething and working with the\r\nunwonted excitement of entertaining such distinguished guests. This was\r\nevident even to such utter strangers as ourselves, for we were\r\nconstantly aware of a scuffling and whispering outside the large room\r\nin which we were entertained, and every now and then became aware of\r\neyes surveying us curiously from some coign of vantage; which eyes, on\r\nmeeting ours, suddenly and silently disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible we sallied out to pay the necessary visit to the\r\npasha of the district. Our coming had been duly announced, and upon\r\narriving at his residence we found him at the landing of the staircase\r\nready to receive us, for consuls-general are great people in Egypt,\r\nhaving diplomatic functions, and being, in all but name, ministers\r\nresident. The pasha was a small, spare, dark little man, with his black\r\nbeard clipped as close as scissors could do it. He was dressed in the\r\nofficial costume--a single-breasted black coat such as some of our\r\nEpiscopal clergymen wear, black trousers, patent-leather boots, and of\r\ncourse the red fez. The reception-room into which he led us was a large\r\none--cool by comparison with the outside air, and somewhat dirty and\r\nshabby, as such places are apt to be, according to my experience.\r\nSeating ourselves according to rank on the rather greasy divan which ran\r\nround three sides of the apartment, we were offered cooling drinks and\r\ncigarettes. (Chibouks are things of the past for all ordinary occasions.\r\nIt's a pity, for they are better smoking than cigarettes, and certainly\r\nmore picturesque.) Compliments were exchanged in bad French, and the\r\nordinary topics discussed, but nothing was said as to the weather except\r\nthat it was warm--a self-evident proposition. The weather is not a\r\nfruitful topic in Egypt. After a little time some officials came in with\r\na whole pile of papers for signature, and we took the opportunity to\r\nterminate our mutual discomfort, the pasha with a perfunctory grin\r\nshaking hands with everybody, at the same time ordering some of his own\r\ncavasses to join ours as a special bodyguard to clear the way for us\r\nthrough the narrow, crowded streets.\r\n\r\nHaving attended to the _bienseances_, we sallied out for sightseeing,\r\ngoing first to the principal mosque, as it was in our way and evidently\r\nconsidered by our guides one of the \"lions.\" Whether it was owing to\r\nthe rank of some of our party or to the presence of the pasha's cavasses\r\nI don't know, but we walked straight into this mosque, without taking\r\noff our boots or putting papooshes over them--the first and last time,\r\nin my experience of the East, in which such a thing was done. There was\r\nsuppressed grumbling on the part of some dervishes and some\r\nold-fashioned turbaned individuals grouped in the arcaded porch, but\r\nnobody seemed to care much about them. There was nothing particular to\r\nsee inside the mosque after we got there. It had not the grand\r\nproportions or elaborate decoration of some of the Cairene mosques,\r\nneither was the pulpit as handsomely carved or the hanging lamps and\r\nostrich-shells as numerous. The coolness of the thick-walled, domed\r\nbuilding was, however, most grateful, for the heat in the streets was by\r\nthis time almost insufferable, and the smells awful.\r\n\r\nBut we had no time for coolness or comfort on this day. We were to dine\r\nwith the vice-consul at two o'clock, and we had not yet seen the fair.\r\nPassing hurriedly through the principal bazaars, we could only glance\r\nabout, for we were almost suffocated by the surging crowds, which\r\npressed upon us in spite of the utmost exertions of our cavasses.\r\nIndeed, we were all too much accustomed to bazaars to have much\r\ncuriosity about these. Escaping to the outskirts of the town, where the\r\nreal fair was held, we found the fun growing fast and furious, and the\r\ndifferent sights and sounds more and more bewildering. Here were\r\nhundreds of tents and other temporary erections, and swarms of people of\r\nthe quaintest appearance, buying and selling, cooking, eating and\r\ndrinking, praying, quarrelling and chaffing. Of course the blue cotton\r\nlong shirts of the indigenous Fellahs lent the principal color to the\r\ncrowd, but this was relieved by the most brilliant-colored clothing\r\namong the visitors and traders, including the red fez on most heads, the\r\nred and yellow headgear of the Arabs, the black caps of the Copts, and\r\nthe white uniforms of the viceroy's nizam or regular soldiers. Sherbet-\r\nand water-sellers pervaded the scene, and added the chatter of their\r\nvoices and the clatter of their brass cups to the already indescribable\r\ndin. There were piles of different sorts of grain; harness for horses,\r\ncamels and buffaloes; heaps of carpets and rugs and clothing; fez caps,\r\npapooshes, pipes and tobacco, mostly the common Jibileh; brass and\r\ncopper cups and cooking utensils, and cheap jewelry and trinkets.\r\nFarther on was a space reserved for buying and selling horses, donkeys,\r\ncamels and cattle, and here were to be seen fellows who would not be off\r\ntheir feet at Tattersall's or at a Kentucky \"quarter race,\" so much are\r\njockeys and horse-dealers alike all the world over. It was really\r\namusing to recognize the well-known \"horsey\" look from under the\r\n_kufieh_ of an Arab whenever the chance for a \"trade\" presented itself.\r\n\r\nNear the horse-fair we became aware of music of a peculiar kind, with a\r\ngood deal of tambourine in it, proceeding from a closed tent; and upon\r\nits becoming known that our party was present, out streamed from the\r\ndoor a group of musicians and almehs, or dancing-women; the latter in\r\nrather light attire, but covered, as to their heads, bosoms, arms and\r\nankles, with strings of jingling coins--some with toe-rings, and all\r\nwith the eyes heavily lined out with kohl and fingers stained with\r\nhenna. These people have not, for many years, been permitted publicly to\r\nexercise their vocation in Northern Egypt, but have been banished away\r\nup the Nile. I presume their presence at the fair was winked at by the\r\nauthorities, and they were probably not the best of their class. Some of\r\nthe women were by no means bad-looking, and they danced with a sway of\r\nfigure and a grace and abandon perfect in their way. It is the same\r\ndance, with the same steps and gestures, which is painted on the walls\r\nof many an ancient Egyptian tomb, and transmitted from the time of\r\nOsortasen and the Pharaoh who knew Joseph. A tremendous crowd at once\r\ncollected on the prospect of a dance at the expense of the strangers,\r\nand, gaping over each other's shoulders, divided their stares between\r\nour party and the almehs. The sun, all this time, was beating down upon\r\nthe scene with power sufficient, one would have thought, to bake the\r\nunprotected brains of most of the company. One of our party became\r\nfairly ill from this cause, and we were all glad to escape from the\r\nreeking markets and streets, and to take refuge once more in the cool\r\nand spacious house of our vice-consul.\r\n\r\nHere we managed to cool off a little, and in due time were ushered into\r\nthe dining-room, where was a table handsomely decked and furnished in\r\nthe European style. Our host took his place at the head of the table,\r\nbut during the whole dinner never touched a morsel, occupying himself in\r\nsuperintending the movements of the numerous servants and in smiling\r\nblandly on each of us as we caught his eye, and evidently inviting us by\r\nhis gestures to \"go in and win.\" When we had had eight or ten courses of\r\nthe usual soups, fish and roast and boiled, accompanied by wine of\r\nseveral sorts, we began to feel that there was a limit to our capacity.\r\nBut there appeared to be none to the resources of our host's larder and\r\nkitchen, for course after course of native dishes was now brought on,\r\nand we were pressed to try one after another of strange-looking and\r\nstill stranger-tasting concoctions. Finally, the list of these seemed to\r\nbe exhausted, and the roasts began over again, until, on the appearance\r\nof a huge turkey stuffed with pistachios, my right-hand neighbor, who\r\nhad a statistical mind, announced that this formed the twentieth course.\r\nAt this point the consul-general interfered, and informed our host, with\r\nmany thanks and compliments, that we could positively eat no more. With\r\na gratified smile and the air of a general who had won a victory he\r\nturned to his servants and ordered the cooking to cease. We were told\r\nafterward that it was the etiquette of a grand repast among wealthy\r\npeople of this class that the courses should continue to appear until\r\nthe guests asked the host's mercy or gave other decided evidence of\r\nrepletion. Our consul-general, knowing this, had been willing to let us\r\nsee how far the thing could go.\r\n\r\nWhen we had risen from table and taken seats upon the divan, the wife\r\nand daughter of our host (Syrian Christians) served us with basins of\r\nperfumed water and fine fringed towels, after which they raised the\r\nhands of the principal members of the party to their lips and foreheads\r\nand thanked them for the great honor they had done them.\r\n\r\nThe sun was by this time low, and the time for our train had quite\r\narrived. So we left the house of our entertainer to walk the short\r\ndistance to the station. On the way we met the horses of one of the\r\nviceroy's squadrons going to water. Beautiful animals they were--all\r\ndark bay or chestnut, splendidly groomed, and marching to the sound of\r\nthe trumpet as steadily as if each carried a rider. The men in charge of\r\nthem were well-set-up, soldier-like fellows, who, barring their white\r\nuniforms and dark faces, might have just ridden out of Knightsbridge\r\nBarracks or the gate of Saumur.\r\n\r\nAt the station we found our car just being attached to the evening-train\r\nfrom Cairo; which train, by the by, had been waiting for us for some\r\ntime, to the very apparent disgust of the English-speaking and other\r\nEuropean passengers. The native passengers seemed to take the delay\r\ncalmly and as a matter of course, some of them spreading their\r\nprayer-carpets upon the platform to recite the evening prayer, to which\r\nthe muezzins were calling from the minarets as we left the town: \"La\r\nIllah illa Allah! Mohammed du russul Ala-a-h!\"\r\n\r\nWe were soon off, passing through most monotonous scenery, with\r\nconstantly recurring groups of Fellahs and their animals returning from\r\ntheir long day of labor, and filing along the causeways and embankments\r\ntoward the mud villages and towns, over which the pigeons were whirling\r\ntheir last flight before betaking themselves to their cotes for the\r\nnight. The air became cooler and the moon rose as we rolled along the\r\nembankment of Lake Mareotis, and the whole scene was so calm and\r\npeaceful and conducive to reverie that it seemed a rude awakening when\r\nwe dashed into the station at Alexandria and the touts and donkey-boys\r\nbegan their tiresome yells and shouts, as if they had never left off\r\nsince morning: \"Onkle Sam, sir! werry good donkey, my master.\"--\"Dis Jim\r\nCrow! more better, sir!\"--\"Hotel Mediterranee, signori!\" Bidding\r\ngood-night to our pleasant and courteous fellow-sightseers, we were\r\nsoon clattering through the streets to the custom-house landing. Our\r\ncutter was waiting: \"Up oars! let fall! give way all!\" and twenty-four\r\nstrong, bronzed arms were pulling us over the smooth surface of the\r\nmoonlit harbor. In ten minutes we were once more on board our floating\r\nhome, and turned in forthwith, tired enough to sleep without rocking.\r\n\r\n     E. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS STRANGE WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    These winter days, my love, are short and sad--\r\n                Oh, sad and short!\r\n    But future summers will not make us glad,\r\n                Of Fate the sport.\r\n\r\n    I go; and where we have been you abide,\r\n                To face the light\r\n    Of days that pour their splendor far and wide,\r\n                And mock the night.\r\n\r\n    How you will hate their brightness well I know--\r\n                Their fragrant ways,\r\n    Thick set with bloom, free winds that come and go,\r\n                And birds that praise\r\n\r\n    The triumph of the summer, and are glad\r\n                Of their desire,\r\n    Fulfilled in warmth, with mirth and music mad,\r\n                And set on fire\r\n\r\n    Of Love, to whom all sweet things do belong:\r\n                Those new, bright days,\r\n    With overflow of blossoms and glad song,\r\n                You will not praise.\r\n\r\n    Nor shall the swift, short nights, when skies bend low,\r\n                And through the blue\r\n    The white moon moves on silently and slow,\r\n                Bring rest to you.\r\n\r\n    The day will vex you, and the night deny\r\n                Your idle prayer:\r\n    Shall I, across strange waters, hear your cry,\r\n                And be aware?\r\n\r\n     LOUISE CHANDLER MOULTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. G.; OR, LILLY'S EARRINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nNot since the day on which we heard of Lee's surrender had there been\r\nsuch a commotion in the house. We who had grown up since that date had\r\nceased to expect anything in the way of pleasure, for \"the war\" was a\r\nghost that wouldn't be laid. Did we want fine dresses, we were asked\r\nwhere the money was coming from, now that Uncle David had lost all his\r\nproperty by the war; did we vainly long for a trip to a Northern city,\r\nwe were consoled by the announcement that if it had not been for the war\r\nUncle David would have taken us to Europe; if we complained that we had\r\nto keep our own rooms in order and sweep the parlors besides, a\r\ndignified reference was made to the former number of servants in the\r\nestablishment; and when we roundly declared that life wasn't worth\r\nliving without a dessert for dinner every day, somebody would say that\r\nit could hardly be expected we should set such a table as we did before\r\nthe war. Positively, we didn't know how old we were, for Aunt Nanny\r\ndeclared that her memory wasn't a yard long on account of the trouble\r\nshe had had during the war, and the family Bible had been \"confiscated\"\r\nby a pious private of taking propensities. Lilly was the older, however:\r\nwe knew that. She was half a head taller than I, and had a dignified\r\nfigure, though she looked like a child in the face and had a good many\r\nchild's ways. She never knew what to do with her hands, for one thing,\r\nand when a little embarrassed she had a sweet cunning habit of putting\r\none hand up to her mouth and laughing behind it. Her mouth was her\r\nprettiest feature. It had a bewitching way of dimpling at the corners,\r\nand the twenty-four pearls behind it had never been touched by the\r\ndentist. This, Aunt Nanny said, was the one good result of the war; for\r\nwe had to eat boiled rice and drink cold water instead of plum-cake and\r\ncoffee; so we kept our teeth sound.\r\n\r\nWe were orphans. Our names were Lilly and Stella Tresvant. Our father\r\nhad been killed during the war, and our mother had died of grief. We\r\nwere little children then, and had been sent to the Island City,\r\nGalveston, to live with Aunt Nanny and Uncle David. We thought ourselves\r\nquite grown-up now. Since we came to our island home we had never been\r\naway from it. It was forlorn enough, though it was a pretty place, all\r\novergrown with oleanders and cape-jessamines. We used to get so tired\r\nwatching the sea, hearing the restless beat, beat of the waves against\r\nthe shore, and seeing the far-off birds dip their wings into the water!\r\nThere was an old book in Uncle David's library that I suppose we had\r\nread a dozen times. It was called _Rasselas_, and was about a young\r\nprince and his sister who lived in a Happy Valley, and yet could never\r\nbe happy until they got away. \"I can sympathize with them,\" Lilly used\r\nto say with such a mournful look in her big gray eyes; \"and yet what was\r\ntheir case compared to ours? They didn't have to wear their\r\ngrandmother's clothes made over, I'm very sure.\"\r\n\r\nBut the turning came in our long lane. One year Uncle David's crop was\r\nuncommonly good. He made a bale to the acre, got it all picked in good\r\ntime, and the hands paid off without any grumbling. His plantation was\r\nin the interior, and just before the cotton was sent off we all went up\r\nto have a look at it. There were about fifty bales--a very good crop for\r\nthese times, though Aunt Nanny declared it wouldn't have been a drop in\r\nthe bucket \"before the war.\" But it looked like immense wealth to Lilly\r\nand myself.\r\n\r\n\"Only think, Stella!\" said Lilly to me: \"if we had just a single bale\r\napiece, what a good time we might have!\"\r\n\r\nNow, it happened that Uncle David overheard this. He was walking about\r\nthe yard, as silent as usual, but he was holding his spectacles in his\r\nhand, and that was with him a sign of great good-humor. We could always\r\ntell the state of the cotton-market by the position of Uncle David's\r\nspectacles; and, as Mrs. Gargery tied on her apron when upon a\r\n\"rampage,\" so uncle jammed his spectacles close to his eyes when things\r\nwere very much out of joint.\r\n\r\n\"Well, girls,\" he said, \"you've been pretty good lately, and I'll\r\npresent you each with a bale of cotton.\"\r\n\r\nWe couldn't speak for surprise. But I flew at Uncle David and gave him\r\nsuch a kissing as he had never had from anybody, I suppose, for he\r\nblushed quite red.\r\n\r\nThen we ran off to the cotton-press to see the last bales pressed. As\r\noften as we had watched that revolving screw and the two mules going\r\nslowly round squeezing the huge bale--it was rather a primitive press\r\nthis, made by the carpenter on the place--we had never looked with an\r\ninterest to compare with that which we now felt. It was our own property\r\nbeing squeezed into shape; and we actually stood there until the\r\nbale in press was rolled out, corded and tied. It was a great\r\nfive-hundred-pounder at least; and \"That's mine,\" said Lil.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been at home a few days a lady called to see us who had been\r\nan old friend of our mother's: Mrs. Long was her name. She was sparkling\r\nwith jewels, and Lil and I were quite dazzled by them and her pretty\r\nclothes and her careless way of saying that she thought of \"running over\r\nto New Orleans for a couple of months,\" just as we should have proposed\r\nto run down to the beach to pick up shells.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could take these two girls with me,\" she said, waving her hand\r\ntoward Lilly and me. \"Would it not be possible, dear Miss Nanny?\"\r\n\r\nAunt Nanny shook her head, and began the usual doleful story about the\r\nwar and its consequences; but Lilly gave me a quick look, and her face\r\nabsolutely flashed. Then she slyly raised those long slim fingers of\r\nhers and spelled out, \"_The cotton_.\"\r\n\r\nWell, pretty soon we heard from the cotton. Uncle David had sent it to\r\nEngland, and it had brought a good price. In he came one day and tossed\r\na little packet into my lap and into Lil's. We opened them, and out\r\ntumbled five twenty-dollar gold-pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Well, young ladies,\" said he, \"what shall you do with your wealth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to New Orleans,\" said Lilly as coolly as ever she spoke in her life.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh! pooh!\" said Aunt Nanny: \"just put it in the bank for a nest-egg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Aunt Nanny,\" said Lilly, who had a perfect genius for argument,\r\n\"what under heaven do we want with a nest-egg? Uncle David gave us this\r\nwithout any conditions: we were to do just as we pleased with it. And I\r\nam tired of staying on this old sand-bar: it just makes me sick to smell\r\nthe oleanders. I want to go somewhere--to see something of life. Mrs.\r\nLong would be delighted to have us go over to New Orleans with her: this\r\nmoney will buy us some new dresses; so _why_ can't we do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they might go, Nanny,\" said that blessed Uncle David; and then\r\nMaum' Hepsey came in. She had been our black mammy, and was a privileged\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\"Lor', yes, Miss Nanny!\" said she: \"let de chillen go, for massy's sake.\r\nDey gits tired joggin' along here in de same ole ruts. 'Tain't gwine ter\r\ncost so very much; an' I'm willin' ter 'conomize six months ter help\r\n'long.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of it all was that Aunt Nanny had to give her consent--that is,\r\nshe said, if Mrs. Long really wanted us. So she dressed in her best--a\r\nlong velvet cloak and a brocaded silk that looked very _ark_aic--and\r\nwent the same day to find out that lady's mind. She came back, of\r\ncourse, with a warm repetition of Mrs. Long's invitation, and an urgent\r\nentreaty to be ready in a week's time. Hence the commotion in our\r\nfamily, for much had to be done in that week of preparation.\r\n\r\nI did not suspect Lilly was not quite happy until one morning when we\r\nwere walking on the beach before breakfast. It was a morning to make one\r\nin love with life. I danced along the hard shining white beach, and was\r\nmore interested in watching the water, that broke into as many ripples\r\nas if the fishes were doing the diagonal waltz under the waves, than in\r\nlooking at Lilly's face; but finally I noticed that she had an ugly\r\nlittle frown on her forehead.\r\n\r\n\"After all, Stell,\" she said, \"one hundred dollars won't go a great\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, Lil, we don't expect to launch out, like Dinah, in\r\n'gorgeous array.'\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but we don't want to look like Southern paupers.\"\r\n\r\n\"As we are,\" said I, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"No matter: we must put the best foot foremost,\" said Lil, looking very\r\npretty and pale and earnest as the salt wind blew back her hair: \"our\r\nnew silks, with some of Aunt Nanny's old lace, will do very well, but\r\nhow I wish we had some jewelry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't care for that,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Good enough reason: you are younger than I am, and don't need it.\" (One\r\nwould have thought Lilly thirty years old.) \"But I should look like a\r\ndifferent being with earrings. I must have a pair.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only question is how to get them,\" said I prosaically, for I'm\r\nalways acting as a drag on Lilly's wheels.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" she said with a tragic air. \"Dear me! I'm tempted to duck my\r\nhead under the water, and let it stay there, when I think of all the\r\ntroubles of life.\"\r\n\r\n    \"'You would be a mermaid fair,\r\n        Sitting alone, sitting alone,'\r\n\r\nand all strung round with corals and pearls. But I'd rather be Stella\r\nTresvant on her way to New Orleans--and breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast, indeed!\" said Lilly with an accent of scorn.\r\n\r\nStill, she ate this meal with a becoming appetite, and after it was\r\nended proposed that we should go and have a chat with Maum' Hepsey.\r\n\r\nWe found Maum' Hepsey in her cabin, sitting in a rickety old\r\nrocking-chair, a short black pipe in her mouth from which she was\r\ndrawing vigorous whiffs of comfort. A slow fire was burning in the\r\nfireplace, and on it was a huge black kettle half filled with white\r\nSouthern corn. This was \"lye hominy\" in course of preparation--the\r\nsucculent lye hominy dear to every Southern heart.\r\n\r\n\"Lor', chillen!\" said Maum' Hepsey, \"it's too hot for you to be in here.\r\nMassy knows if I wazn't seasoned to it I'd drap in my tracks, dis fire\r\nis so pow'ful drawin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind, maum'; we can sit in the door. We just came to talk to\r\nyou about our troubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sakes alive! I thought your troubles waz about over, now dat you're\r\ngwine ter have a trip to Orleans.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" sighed Lil: \"we're going off to that grand city, where I\r\nsuppose the ladies wear silks and satins every day, and we've nothing to\r\nwear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whar's de money for de cotton?\" Maum' Hepsey demanded, her lower jaw\r\ndropping in such a surprised way that the black pipe fell out and barely\r\nescaped the lye hominy.\r\n\r\n\"A hundred dollars doesn't go very far,\" said Lil contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, chillen, in my young days dat waz pretty much of a sum--sho's yo'\r\nborn it waz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Things are different now; and besides, Maum' Hepsey, you don't know how\r\na dressed-up lady ought to look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Highty-tighty!\" said maum', while her eyes sparkled alarmingly. \"As if\r\nI ain't seen mo' finery in a month dan you has in every blessed year of\r\nyour life! Lor'! when my young mars' brung his bride over from Orleans\r\ndat chile didn't have a gownd in her trunk dat warn't made of Injy silk;\r\nan' she did look han'some a-trailin' round in 'em. An' you tell me I\r\ndonno what fine dressin' is! Go 'long, chile! you've lost your manners.\"\r\n\r\nMaum' Hepsey was really offended, and I hastened to soothe her: \"Lil\r\nonly meant that you didn't know how the ladies dressed now. We are to\r\nhave two new dresses, maum', but Lilly's trouble is that she hasn't any\r\njewelry.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her turbaned head: \"Jewelry costs a sight of money, honey. My\r\nyoung mis', she had a ring on her finger wid a stun in it like a star.\r\n'Twarn't no bigger 'n a baby hazelnut, but, sho's yo' born, chillen, dat\r\nring cost _ten hundred dollars_!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a diamond,\" said Lilly in an awed voice. \"I never expect to\r\nhave one if I live to be a thousand years old.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chillen,\" said Maum' Hepsey, lowering her voice, \"why don't you git\r\nMiss Nanny to let you open dat trunk in de attic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose is it, Maum' Hepsey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lor', honey! didn't you never hear 'bout dat trunk? It was lef' wid\r\nyour Uncle David for sto'age durin' de war. A slim, dark-complected\r\nyoung man brought it one evenin' about sundown, an' from dat day to dis\r\nnone of us has ever set eyes on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose became of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"De good Lord knows, honey. Mos' likely he waz killed: men dropped down\r\nlike oleander-blossoms in de high winds in dem dreadful days. Now, I\r\nshouldn't wonder, chillen, if dar waz _money_ in dat trunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"So there might be,\" said Lilly with a start.\r\n\r\n\"It must ha' held somethin' valerble,\" said Maum' Hepsey, looking like a\r\nsolemn old owl, \"else why should he ha' been so mighty pertickeler 'bout\r\nhavin' it stored safe? Den, ag'in, he must ha' been killed, else why\r\nshouldn't he ha' come back for it? An' why should we let de\r\nthings--whatever is in it--moulder away, instead o' gettin' de good of\r\n'em like sensible folks?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shouldn't have any right,\" said I doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Oh shoo, chile, shoo! You'd have just as much right as de rats an'\r\nmice.\"\r\n\r\nLilly jumped up. \"I think Maum' Hepsey's idea a good one,\" said she.\r\n\"Who knows? That trunk may turn out a gold-mine.\"\r\n\r\nBack we went to the house, and made an appeal to Aunt Nanny to be\r\nallowed to open the trunk.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, girls! what will you think of next?\" said she. \"I had almost\r\nforgotten that old trunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us about the man who left it, aunty. What was his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what none of us know. He came here about dusk one evening--a\r\nwild, distracted looking man he was--and said he wanted to leave a trunk\r\nuntil called for. You know your uncle David was a commission-merchant,\r\nand very often had packages left with him for safe-keeping. He had a\r\nbook in which he registered the names of the owners, descriptions of the\r\nparcels, etc. He turned to his desk to get out this ledger, and when he\r\nlooked round again the man was gone. Your uncle ran to the door, but no\r\ntrace of him was to be seen. He says that he would have thought the\r\nwhole thing a dream, but for the little trunk on the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a romance!\" cried Lil.\r\n\r\n\"The poor fellow must have been killed,\" said Aunt Nanny. \"We advertised\r\nthe trunk after the war, but no claimant ever came for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've kept it all this time without looking into it? How could\r\nyou? It would have been a perfect Blue Beard's chamber to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, child! With all the trouble that's come to this house I've had\r\nother things to do than to go prying into strangers' trunks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got to pry now,\" said Lilly with her little air of\r\ndecision. \"Who knows what treasures we may unearth? Can't we open it,\r\naunty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if Uncle David says so.\"\r\n\r\nWe could hardly wait for Uncle David to come home. We dragged the trunk\r\ndown from the attic to the sitting-room: finally, we went to the gate to\r\nwatch for Uncle David, and before he was well in the house had won his\r\nconsent to open the trunk. In fact, I think he was not without a mild\r\ncuriosity himself, though he said, \"I feel uncommonly like a burglar,\"\r\nas he knelt down by the trunk and tried to force the lock.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know how a burglar feels?\" said Lil saucily.\r\n\r\nIt was rather an exciting moment. A sea-breeze sprang up, and the blinds\r\nrattled loudly, as though some angry hand were trying to break them\r\naway. I started nervously and looked over my shoulder, half expecting to\r\nsee the wrathful face of a slim, dark man. A cold air blew through the\r\nroom. It almost seemed that viewless influences were interposing to save\r\nthe stranger's treasures from profanation.\r\n\r\nIt was a spring lock, and it flew open with a snap. We peered eagerly\r\ninto the trunk. Commonplace enough! Uncle David handed out one shirt\r\nafter another.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Lilly, \"only a man's shirts!\"\r\n\r\n\"But only look!\" said Aunt Nanny, \"what exquisite linen! and how neatly\r\nmade! Some woman's hand is in this.\"\r\n\r\nLil picked one up and looked at it curiously: \"Well, they are nicely\r\ndone: no sewing-machine work here. And see, aunty, here are initials.\"\r\n\r\nThe initials \"C. G.\" were marked in delicate embroidery on all the\r\ngarments. Next came a lot of gentleman's handkerchiefs marked in the\r\nsame way, and with them half a dozen thread cambric, lace-bordered\r\nhandkerchiefs, evidently intended for a lady's use, and without mark.\r\nThe next thing was a dress-suit, in which we took very little interest:\r\nthen a yellow sheet of paper that we seized eagerly. We hoped it was a\r\nletter, but it was a poem without date or signature, written in French:\r\n\r\n    Qu'elle est belle la marquise!\r\n    Que sa toilette est exquise!\r\n    Gants glacees a dix boutons,\r\n    Et bottines hauts talons!\r\n      Qu'elle est belle la marquise!\r\n\r\n    Quelles delices, quel delire,\r\n    Dans sa bouche et son sourire!\r\n    Et sa voix--qui ne dirait\r\n    Que le rossignol chantait?\r\n      Qu'elle est belle la marquise!\r\n\r\n    La marquise! ma marquise!\r\n    Bel amour est sa devise,\r\n    Et sa profession de foi\r\n    Est: je vous aime--aimez moi!\r\n      Qu'elle est belle la marquise!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how interesting!\" cried Lilly. \"I shall die if I don't find out\r\nsomething more about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll never hear of him again,\" said I, \"so make up your mind to\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he had left one he loved,\" said Uncle David, \"and she waited\r\nfor him day after day, and he never came back to her.\"\r\n\r\nUncle David's voice was as sad as the echo in a tomb. I thought I saw\r\ntears in the misty blue eyes behind the spectacles; and I believe at\r\nthat moment, for the first time in my life, I realized that Uncle David,\r\nold and gray and wrinkled though he was, had a heart that had suffered.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lilly, shaking back her hair impatiently, \"is there\r\nanything more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only this little box.\"\r\n\r\nWe opened the box, and there, on a bed of pink cotton, were a pair of\r\ncuff-buttons, the most elegant we had ever seen. They were onyx, with\r\ndiamond stars for a centre. The diamonds were all small except the\r\ncentral ones, that were like the dewdrops at the tips of narrow leaves.\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful!\" cried Lilly.\r\n\r\n\"These diamonds are of great value,\" said Uncle David, examining them\r\ncritically.\r\n\r\n\"But this man must have had friends,\" said I: \"there must be some one in\r\nthe world to whom these things ought to belong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until those friends are found,\" said Lilly, \"I propose that we act as\r\nMr. Unknown's heir and executors. You can have the handkerchiefs, Stell,\r\nand I will take these buttons: they could be made into lovely earrings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lilly! should you like to wear them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly: why not?\" and Lilly ran to the glass and held one of the\r\ndarkly-shining stones against her pale, pretty cheek.--\"Don't oppose it,\r\naunty dear. Only think! fifteen years and the man not heard from!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are his initials again,\" said I, picking up the other button, on\r\nwhose gold side the initials were engraved. \"'C. G.'--Constant Gower?\r\nColton Goran?\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense, Stell!\" interrupted Lilly.--\"Tell me, Aunt Nanny--may I\r\nhave the buttons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I suppose so, child. You always manage to have your own way; and\r\nif your uncle David is willing, I've no objections.\"\r\n\r\nUncle David was equally willing, so Lilly took triumphant possession of\r\nthe buttons.\r\n\r\nAnother week saw us on our way to New Orleans. We were neither of us\r\nseasick, and we enjoyed every moment of the voyage across the Gulf. Mrs.\r\nLong seemed glad to have us, and was interested in our incessant talk.\r\nLilly of course gave her the whole story of the Frenchman's buttons, and\r\nbrought them out for her inspection. She said they would make lovely\r\nearrings, and that she must attend to that the first thing on reaching\r\nNew Orleans.\r\n\r\nShe took us to the St. Charles Hotel, and with beating hearts we made\r\nour toilettes for the table d'hote. What a grand occasion that was to\r\nus! I was rather frightened, but Lilly actually seemed to grow taller as\r\nshe put on her new dress. She had chosen the suit herself, and while the\r\nskirt was black silk, the bodice was deep crimson laced in the back. Her\r\nface rose from it like a lily, pure and pale. I looked at her with\r\nadmiration and despair, for in my nervousness I felt that my face was\r\nthe color of an Indian peach. Once seated in the dining-room, however,\r\nwe soon began to feel a comfortable sense of our own insignificance, and\r\nto look about at our neighbors as Mrs. Long was doing.\r\n\r\nA season of delight now set in for us. We went to museums and\r\npicture-galleries; we drove on the Shell Road that wound in shining\r\ndistance like a silver chain; and walked on Canal and Carondelet\r\nstreets, equally interested in the fine shop-windows and the fine\r\nlanguid ladies who strolled past them.\r\n\r\nTo be in New Orleans at any time would have been joy enough, but it was\r\n\"gilding refined gold\" to be there in the gay week preceding the\r\nCarnival, and to look forward to Mardi-Gras itself to round off our\r\nvisit. Already immense \"proclamations,\" printed in every color of the\r\nrainbow, were thrown about the city like handbills, running somewhat in\r\nthis style:\r\n\r\n\"We command that Tuesday, Mardi-Gras, March 5, be set apart as a day of\r\nFun, Folly and Frolic, when the innocent license of the mask shall have\r\nno let, when the places of festivity shall offer a night of pleasure to\r\nall our people, and when the pageant of the Mystick Krewe of Comus shall\r\ndazzle the eye and captivate the reason by the wonders of art and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n             \"Signed, REX.\r\n\r\n     \"Attest: TYPHOON, PUCK.\"\r\n\r\nWho composed this Mystic Krewe no one knew. Year after year, like a\r\nsplendid dream, a glittering procession moved through the streets at\r\ndusk of Shrove-Tuesday, representing the fairest myths of fable and the\r\nmost gorgeous pageants of history. Mrs. Long, who had seen a Roman\r\nCarnival, declared it far surpassed in magnificence by that of our own\r\nSouthern city. And we--lucky, lucky girls that we were!--were to see it\r\nall! We were even to go to the grand ball at the opera-house; for,\r\nthough Aunt Nanny did not approve of balls, and we had never been to\r\none, Mrs. Long declared it would do no harm for \"once in a way,\" and\r\nthat it would be a memory for a lifetime.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my story to tell of the delights of the great day, nor\r\nof its magnificent displays; nor of our fluttering hearts as we dressed\r\nfor the ball; nor of how pretty Lilly looked all in white, with white\r\nflowers in her dark hair, and the onyx earrings shining against her fair\r\ncheeks; nor even of the beautiful ball itself. A memory for a life Mrs.\r\nLong declared it would be; and this, I doubt not, it will prove, but for\r\na reason she will never guess. Something happened so romantic, so\r\nwonderful, so extraordinary, that I am sure when we are old, old\r\nladies--\"sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything\"--it will\r\ngive us a thrill of the blood to think of that Mardi-Gras ball.\r\n\r\nWe were dancing in a cotillon. It was the basket figure, where the\r\nladies are all grouped in the centre. I was on one side of Lilly: on the\r\nother was a pretty, foreign-looking little creature dressed in black\r\nwith gleams of scarlet breaking through. Imagine what we felt when this\r\nlovely apparition seized Lilly by the wrist and said in a low, agitated\r\nvoice, \"In the name of Heaven, young lady, tell me where you got the\r\nearrings that you wear in your ears!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the dance had separated us. Lilly and I had only time to\r\nexchange one glance of wonder. After the dance, when we were taken back\r\nto our seats and our partners had left us, the stranger came over to us\r\nand said rapidly, in a low voice and with a strong French accent,\r\n\"Pardon my impertinence, _je vous en prie_. But is it that you will\r\nanswer my question?\"\r\n\r\nI did not know what to say, but Lilly, who is never at a loss, replied,\r\n\"The story would be rather long to give in a ballroom, and I don't know\r\nwhat right you have to ask it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Verra true,\" said she gently; \"but I did once see a pair of buttons ze\r\ntwins of your earrings. Ze letters 'C. G.' were engraved on ze gold\r\nbacks.\"\r\n\r\nShe was watching Lilly closely as she spoke. My sister blushed crimson,\r\nand said, \"If that be so, you have more right to them than I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, mon Dieu!\" cried the stranger: \"it is as I hoped! When can I see\r\nyou? Where? how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and see me: I am at the St. Charles Hotel. My name is Lilly\r\nTresvant.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are with your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: with a friend--Mrs. Long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, your chaperone! And she will wish to know who is your visitor. I\r\ncannot have it arranged that way.\" She seemed in deep thought: then\r\nsaid, \"Listen, cheres demoiselles. There are reasons why I wish it not\r\nknown that we have met: I will explain all when I see you. Do you go\r\nsometimes to ze French market?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes--often.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then, to-morrow morning: I will meet you. I will tell my story,\r\nand you will tell yours. Mon Dieu! after all these years, how strange! I\r\nmust leave you now. Au revoir. Remember, to-morrow, early, at ze French\r\nmarket; and not one word to your chaperone, Madame Long: you promise?\"\r\n\r\nWe promised of course--what foolish girls wouldn't have promised?--and\r\nthe graceful little Frenchwoman moved away, leaving two girls more\r\ninterested and excited than they had ever been in all their lives. We\r\ncared no more for the ball: we went home like people in a dream. We\r\nscarcely slept that night, fearing to be late for the French market in\r\nthe morning. Before it was fairly light we had dressed ourselves and\r\nhurried off.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Stell!\" cried my tall sister, \"let us never say we haven't had an\r\nadventure! No novel I ever read was half so exciting. I feel quite like\r\na heroine, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the little Frenchwoman is more the heroine of the piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so she is; and she ought to be. Isn't she a charming, graceful,\r\npretty creature?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is pretty,\" said I, hurrying along to keep pace with Lilly's long\r\nsteps, \"but there was something about her I did not quite like. It\r\nseemed to me she had a sort of common look, in spite of her fine dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Common! Well, Stell, you had better not say anything more!\" said Lilly\r\nwith crushing emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"It was so queer,\" persisted I, \"that she made us promise not to say\r\nanything to Mrs. Long!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that will all be explained.\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt like a conspirator stealing out of the house this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if we don't go to the French market whenever we like! And there's\r\ncertainly no harm in going to meet a _lady_. If it had been a young man\r\nnow!\" and Lilly's laugh rang out gayly.\r\n\r\nThe French market was as pretty and bright as usual, though it was the\r\ndull Ash Wednesday morning. The long line of stalls was bright with\r\nfruits and flowers, and walking about, buying, staring, chatting,\r\ndrinking coffee, eating oranges, were people of almost every nationality\r\nunder heaven. However, the unique interest of the scene, this morning\r\nat least, was thrown away upon us. In the crowd we soon distinguished\r\nthe figure of the little Frenchwoman, and joined her at once. She had on\r\na close black bonnet and a veil, and did not look nearly so pretty as\r\nshe had looked the night before. Her skin lacked delicacy, and there was\r\na haggard look about her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mes cheres demoiselles,\" she exclaimed, \"I have thought of nothing all\r\nnight but of seeing you here this morning.\"\r\n\r\nWe very truthfully assured her that such had been the case with\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"You did not wear them?\" exclaimed she, looking at Lilly's ears.\r\n\r\n\"I meant to,\" said Lilly with a start, \"but getting off in such a hurry,\r\nand never wearing them in the morning, I forgot to put them in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes: they are too handsome for morning. You have ze good taste,\r\nmademoiselle. Come, now, let us take some coffee together, then we can\r\ngo over where it is quiet and talk.\"\r\n\r\nShe took us to an old Frenchwoman's stand, and we each drank a cup of\r\nthe strong black coffee, which she insisted on paying for. Then we\r\ncrossed the market to a deserted stall, whose owner had probably sold\r\nout her small stock at an early hour and gone home. We sat down, and she\r\nbegan: \"You have told me your name. Mine is Gardine--Vera Gardine. I\r\nhave a brother named Clement Gardine.\"\r\n\r\n\"C. G.!\" cried Lilly.\r\n\r\n\"C. G.,\" said she with a sigh. \"You have perhaps heard of the Gardine\r\nfamily? The old name is well known in ze city.\"\r\n\r\nWe confessed with some shame that it was unknown to us.\r\n\r\nShe sighed again: \"Ah! it is a sad story: I will tell it to you in ze\r\nway ze most quickest. We are French, but born in zis country--creoles,\r\nyou know. I was but a leetle girl when ze war began, and my brother had\r\nscarcely twenty years. But he was so brave, so reckless: go to ze war he\r\nwould, almost breaking ze heart of his--his--fiancee--what you call it\r\nin English: his engaged girl--ze gentle, lovely Florine. When ze\r\nNorthern army came to New Orleans, Florine's father and mother ran away\r\nwith her to Texas--made of themselves refugees. Soon after both parents\r\ndied, and Florine was left so all alone that my brother determined to\r\nmarry her at once. He got a furlough from his general, and came home in\r\ndisguise. It was joy all mixed with fear to see him. Blockade-steamers\r\nwere running all ze time from New Orleans to Galveston, and he took\r\npassage in one of them. He had no baggages, but one small trunk that I\r\npacked for him--his dress-suit, some shirts that I had made, some lace\r\nhandkerchiefs that I was sending to Florine. In this trunk too were ze\r\nstar buttons, heirlooms in ze famille Gardine. He was to spend his\r\nhoneymoon in Texas until his furlough had expired: then he was to bring\r\nFlorine to me, and he was to go back to his regiment. He left me, brave,\r\nstrong, full of hope, and from zat time till one long year afterward I\r\nneither saw nor heard from mon frere.\r\n\r\n\"I was distracted. I wrote letters here, there, everywhere. It was no\r\nuse. The city was besieged: I could not get out of it. Oh, what\r\nsuffering to remember!\r\n\r\n\"One day, in my heart-sickness, longing to do something with my life, I\r\nwent with one of ze good Sisters of our Church into ze city hospital.\r\nAnd there I found my brother, his head shaved, raving with fever! He had\r\nbeen fighting, they told me, with one of ze guerilla-bands around ze\r\ncity--had been captured and brought there wounded dangerously. I took\r\nhim home, nursed him night and day, and at last had my reward. He knew\r\nme--ze consciousness had come back to him. You can guess ze questions I\r\npoured out, but oh, mes cheres demoiselles, you cannot guess ze sister's\r\nagony when I found zat mon pauvre frere had forgotten every circumstance\r\nof ze past year!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how dreadful!\" cried Lilly, her eyes filling with tears. \"What did\r\nyou do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What _could_ I do? Ze doctair said it was not an uncommon case. There\r\nhad been some injury to ze brain. Clement remembered coming to New\r\nOrleans, and making his preparations to go to Florine; but from zat\r\ntime all was a dreadful blank. I drove him almost wild with my tears and\r\nquestions, for what had become of Florine? As soon as he was well, and\r\nwe could get away from the city, we went to Texas to try and find her,\r\nbut our search was all in vain.\r\n\r\n\"And now you can judge what I felt when I saw ze star buttons in zis\r\nyoung lady's ears.\"--She turned to Lilly, and spoke in a voice all\r\nbroken with emotion: \"It seemed that at last I had a key to unlock ze\r\ndoor of that sad year. Tell me quickly, mademoiselle, where did you get\r\nthem? Did Florine give them to you? Is she dead? Tell me all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are deceived, Miss Gardine,\" said Lilly, almost ready to burst into\r\ntears. \"All I can tell is very little. A trunk was brought to my uncle's\r\nin Galveston by a young man, who rushed off before uncle could even ask\r\nhis name. From that day we have never heard from him, and out of\r\ncuriosity my sister and I persuaded Uncle David to let us open the\r\ntrunk.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Gardine clasped her hands tragically: \"Helas! after so much hope to\r\nfind only disappointment! Ze saddest part of it all is this,\" she went\r\non. \"Since it all happened mon pauvre frere has been so miserable zat\r\nsometimes he loses his mind: he is _mad_. No one knows this but\r\nmyself--no one shall know. In society he is ze elegant young man: yes,\r\npeople who admire him little dream when he is away, and they think him\r\non his plantation up ze Bayou Teche, zat he is in a private madhouse in\r\nze city, watched over by poor Vera.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her handkerchief to her eyes, and Lilly and I looked at each\r\nother with deep, silent sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"This is why I have begged your secrecy,\" she said. \"Your chaperone,\r\nMadame Long, possibly knows many people: she would talk. Ze misfortunes\r\nof Clement Gardine must not be talked over by ze vulgaire herd.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" said I diffidently, \"that Mrs. Long would be prudent.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear child,\" said mademoiselle, smiling sadly, \"it is better not to\r\nput her to ze test. Besides, what good would it do?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so, Stell,\" said Lilly impatiently. \"Why are you always so\r\nanxious to tell things?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have one last hope,\" said Miss Gardine. \"Ze doctair has said if my\r\nbrother could once remember zat last year he might be cured entierement.\r\nIt is brooding on zat subject that brought on his insanity: he needs a\r\nshock. Now, if you will go with me when I visit him, and show him\r\nsuddenly ze star buttons--who knows?--all may come back to him. I have\r\ntold ze doctair all ze story, and he thinks it a plan of wisdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure it is,\" said Lilly, \"and I will go with you with pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"To a madhouse?\" cried I.\r\n\r\n\"You would never know it was zat,\" said the French lady: \"it is like one\r\nfine private house, ze patients are all so gentle.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that we promised to meet her at the Catholic cathedral\r\nthe next day, and go with her to see her brother. \"Dress very simply,\"\r\nsaid she at parting, \"and do not fear anysing. If any one speaks to you\r\nin ze house, all you must do is to make one courtesy very respectful,\r\nand humor them in their leetle fancies.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Long noticed the next day our preoccupation and aversion to our\r\nusual interests, but, thinking it the natural reaction after the\r\nexcitement of the past weeks, she forbore to question us.\r\n\r\nWe were promptly at the place of appointment next day, and so was Miss\r\nVera. A carriage was called, and we were driven rapidly to a house just\r\non the edge of the city--a fine, rambling old house, set far back in\r\nbeautiful grounds and surrounded by an iron fence. Heavy iron gates\r\nswung open harshly, and closed after us with a clanging, dismal sound. I\r\nclung to Lilly's arm, feeling very nervous, but her courage seemed to\r\nrise with the occasion. \"You had better take the earrings out,\" said\r\nMiss Gardine before we went in: \"here is a box I have brought on\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nLilly handed her the earrings, together with the package of lace\r\nhandkerchiefs that I had appropriated.\r\n\r\nBy this time we had reached the door. Miss Gardine unlocked it with a\r\nkey she had in her pocket, and we entered a beautiful picture-hung hall\r\nwith a silver lamp swinging from its ceiling. On either side were rooms\r\nexquisitely furnished, it seemed to us in a hasty glance. Certainly,\r\nMiss Vera had been right when she had said there was nothing to frighten\r\nany one about this madhouse. In a boudoir that we passed a young lady\r\nsat at a piano singing--a beautiful girl dressed in blue, with bare\r\narms. I glanced inquiringly at Vera. \"Yes,\" said she, nodding her head,\r\n\"zat is one of ze saddest cases here. Her lover was killed in a duel on\r\nze bridal-eve, and she became insane. She is quite incurable.\"\r\n\r\nWe went up a flight of broad stairs, and in the hall encountered an old\r\nlady with white hair elaborately dressed. \"Why! why! why!\" said she,\r\nstopping short: \"who are these girls, Marie? You must be having a\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only some friends from the country, madame, come to spend an hour with\r\nme,\" said Vera in French and with a low courtesy.\r\n\r\n\"Very decent-looking girls,\" said madame, looking at us coolly through a\r\ngold-mounted glass. \"Here, Marie! When you did my hair you made the pins\r\nstick in me. Just see if you can't relieve me.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down, and Vera--or \"Marie,\" as this poor old mad lady called\r\nher--gave some deft touches to the gray head. \"That is better,\" said\r\nmadame graciously. \"Now, where's your cap, child?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my pocket, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it on, put it on: I don't want you to be aping lady-airs.\"\r\n\r\nVera pulled out a little cap and put it on her silky black locks,\r\nsmiling sweetly, and greatly impressing us by her amiability and tact.\r\nThen the old lady went down the stairs, and the French girl said with a\r\nshrug, \"Sometimes she fancies me her maid, sometimes her daughter--la\r\npauvre femme!\"\r\n\r\nUp another flight, and we stopped before a closed door.\r\n\r\n\"He is here,\" said Vera in a low, intense voice.\r\n\r\nLilly put her hand on her heart as if to stop its beating. As for me, I\r\nwas only conscious of a feeling of burning curiosity.\r\n\r\nVera threw open the door. A young man was seated in the centre of the\r\nroom, leaning on a table. His face was buried in his hands. \"He will sit\r\nthat way for hours,\" whispered his sister.--Then she said aloud,\r\n\"Clement!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up; an angry flush rose to his face; with one bound he was at\r\nVera's side, snatched the little cap from her head and tore it into\r\nshreds.\r\n\r\nI was fearfully alarmed at this exhibition, and Vera looked deeply\r\nmortified. \"He has never been so violent,\" she exclaimed; \"and this was\r\nmy fault: I had forgotten that I had on ze miserable little thing.\"--She\r\nfixed her eyes on him steadily and said, \"Clement, I have brought some\r\nvisitors to see you.\"\r\n\r\nA gleam of something like reason crossed his face: he made a graceful\r\nbow. Lilly looked fascinated. He was a singularly handsome man, very\r\ndark, with glittering black eyes, and hair falling on his shoulders. On\r\nhis head was a red velvet smoking-cap.\r\n\r\n\"They have brought something to show you, Clement,\" she went on, as\r\nslowly as if counting her words--\"something that you have missed for\r\nmany years.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the box and flashed the earrings before his eyes. He started\r\nup, and in a voice of anguish he cried, \"The star buttons!\"\r\n\r\n\"He recognizes! he remembers!\" cried Vera.\r\n\r\n\"Remember?\" he exclaimed--\"remember what? A ship ploughing the Gulf--\"\r\nHe stopped, pressed his hands madly to his forehead. \"Down, down, demon\r\npain!\" Then the words came pouring out like a torrent: \"Light breaks\r\nthrough the night. A ship crosses the Gulf: a woman begs me, for the\r\nsake of her I love, to go with her--to save her father. He is in prison,\r\nhe has murdered a man, but he is old: she loves him--she kneels to me. I\r\npromised to help him escape: I did my best. I said Florine could wait.\r\nI left my trunk in an old man's counting-room. We laid our plans, but we\r\nfailed in all. The father was shot like a dog; I was captured; I was\r\nsent up the country for trial. Months in prison: free at last to fly to\r\nFlorine, to find my bride. Now, now, now, it comes to me. I was too\r\nlate: Florine had been murdered by the Indians!\"\r\n\r\nHe flung his arms above his head and fell to the floor. We were in a\r\nstate of the wildest excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is saved! I am sure of it!\" cried Vera. \"Go now, dear young\r\nladies: he must not see you when he comes to himself. Ze carriage is\r\nwaiting. I will see you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we leave New Orleans to-morrow,\" said Lilly.\r\n\r\n\"I will write to you. You are my friends for life.\"\r\n\r\nLilly hastily scribbled an address on a card. \"Here is my address,\" she\r\nsaid: \"you will surely write?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! Heaven bless you!\" She seized Lilly's hand and kissed it.\r\n\"You shall hear from me: you shall find that Vera Gardine is not\r\nungrateful.\"\r\n\r\nShe hurried us out, closing the door behind us. The way was clear: we\r\nran lightly through the halls, hardly daring to breathe until we were\r\nsafely out of the house and in the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Drive to the Catholic cathedral,\" said Lilly. The carriage-door was\r\nshut, and then we could give vent to our emotions. Lilly was half wild:\r\nshe laughed and cried together. \"Do you think he will get well?\" she\r\nsaid: \"_do_ you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell, Lilly? The buttons seemed to give him enough of a\r\nshock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't it wonderful? Oh, Stella, what a romance! It is all perfectly\r\nclear to me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's far from being clear to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you see: he met this woman on the boat and engaged with her\r\nin some desperate enterprise to save her father. He left the trunk at\r\nUncle David's--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but why didn't he give a name or an address with the trunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he was so beside himself that he hardly knew what he was\r\ndoing. You can see that he is of a very excitable temperament. Then the\r\nrest of it is easy to imagine. Poor, poor fellow! how he must have\r\nsuffered! Didn't you think him very handsome, Stella?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very: he looked like the Corsair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose he will ever get over it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get over what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Florine's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never!\" said I emphatically.\r\n\r\nLilly sighed a little, and said that she thought Vera ought never to\r\nmarry, but to devote her life to consoling Clement for all he had\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Long had thought us abstracted before, I don't know what she\r\nthought now. We scarcely spoke unless she addressed us, and then we made\r\nanswers as wide of the mark as a boy's first shots. Only once Lilly\r\nroused to interest: Mrs. Long was speaking of the old French families of\r\nNew Orleans, and Lilly said, \"Oh, Mrs. Long, did you ever hear of the\r\nGardines?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said the lady: \"they're one of the oldest and best\r\nfamilies. Vera Gardine is quite a belle in society, and Clement is a\r\nfine young man. He does not fritter away his time, as so many young men\r\ndo, but works away like a good fellow at his plantation up on the Bayou\r\nTeche.\"\r\n\r\nLilly and I stole a look at each other. How we should have electrified\r\ngood Mrs. Long had we told her all we knew about poor Clement Gardine!\r\n\r\nWe went back to Galveston, feeling that a whole world of experience had\r\nopened to us since we left it. We were not the same girls, and never\r\ncould be again. Lilly flew into a passion when she found Uncle David\r\nwearing one of \"C. G.'s\" sacred shirts, and insisted that they should be\r\ndone up at once in a parcel ready to send to Miss Gardine.\r\n\r\n\"I am determined to have them both come over and make us a visit,\" she\r\nsaid confidentially to me.\r\n\r\nWe had not been forbidden to tell the story at home, but while Aunt\r\nNanny and Maum' Hepsey listened very sympathetically. Uncle David\r\nlaughed a good deal, and said, \"She's going to write to you, is she?\r\nWell, show me the letter when it comes.\"\r\n\r\nWe waited long for that letter, and at last it came; and when we had\r\nread it we knew exactly how a man might feel upon whom a rock fell out\r\nof a clear sky--that is, if he had time to feel anything. Here is the\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\"MES CHERES DEMOISELLES: You will watch with your pretty eyes many days\r\nfor the postman before that he bring you this lettre. And why? Because I\r\nam going to be very generous. You have gif me ze diamond: I will give\r\nyou ze lesson. But it is not safe to gif it too soon; so I leave this\r\nlettre in charge of un ami, who is to mail it four weeks from zis day.\r\nMy lesson is zis: 'Do not ever talk loud when you travel; do not keep\r\nsecrets from your chaperone; and when you have a diamond hold on to\r\nit--gardez-le.' Do you understand, mes jolies et simples demoiselles?\r\nWhen you gave ze histoire of ze earrings to your Madame Long on ze\r\nsteamer, 'Clement'--ha! ha!--heard it all. Clement--whose name is\r\nJules--live very mooch by his wits; and he saw that these diamonds must\r\nbe his--that you were two dear leetle geese--pardon!--ready to have ze\r\nfeathers plucked. How to get at you he did not know: you were always\r\nwith that chaperone with sharp eyes. It was I--Marie, Jules's little\r\nwife--who made up ze plan, so bold, so simple, so originale, ma foi! We\r\nhad been in bad circumstance a long while: I was ze French maid chez\r\nMadame Gardine. Comprenez-vous? On ze ball-night Mademoiselle Vera was\r\nsick, but I was well. I took her ticket--I wore her belle robe--I went\r\nto ze ball for one dance, to meet you. My pretty romance turned your\r\nlittle heads. I have been on ze stage: I have not forgot how to act. I\r\ntook you to ze Gardine house--ze madhouse, you know. Ze family were\r\ngoing out to dine, but we were too early. You saw Mademoiselle Vera at\r\nze piano: you met madame in ze hall. It was for me an excited moment,\r\nbut you suspected nothing. Jules did his part not ill: he won ze tears\r\nfrom your eyes. One of ze lace handkerchiefs I have kept, cheres\r\ndemoiselles, as a souvenir: the others, with ze diamond earrings, were\r\nchanged into money tout de suite. They sold for much money: we have been\r\nable to take a little trip, perhaps to Cuba, where we eat ices and drive\r\nalong beautiful roads; perhaps to one gay Northern city, where we go to\r\nthe play every night. Wherever it is we are happy--we think much of you.\r\nJules calls you our sweet benefactors. And I tell you all this that you\r\nmay know I spoke not false when I said, 'Vera Gardine will not be\r\nungrateful'--a promise that you must own well kept by MARIE ZANETTI.\r\n\r\n\"P. S. And that pauvre 'C. G.!' we wonder mooch about him. Charmante\r\nmystere!\"\r\n\r\nLilly fainted outright, and we had a time of it generally. In the midst\r\nof it all, Uncle David said dryly, \"Well, Nanny, I suppose you may hand\r\nme over that bundle of shirts now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be worth mentioning that years after we met the real Gardines,\r\nand very charming people we found them. And it is I who am now Mrs.\r\nClement Gardine, and am living on my husband's Louisiana plantation. As\r\nfor Lilly, she can laugh now as she thinks of the accomplished rogues\r\nwho deceived us so nicely, but she has developed a pronounced hatred for\r\nthe French language, and I don't believe any one could ever win her\r\nheart whose initials happened to be \"C. G.\"\r\n\r\n     SHERWOOD BONNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENGLISH TEACHER IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I landed in Boston, in January, 1874, it was neither to \"make my\r\nfortune\" nor to hunt buffaloes or bears in the neighborhood of that\r\nclassic city. Nevertheless, just to show my readers that there is a\r\nmeasure of truth in the prevalent impressions here of John Bull's\r\ngeneral ignorance and apathy as to what is going on in America, I\r\nwillingly admit that not till I had been a few days resident in\r\nCambridge did the unpalatable fact fully dawn upon me that the country\r\nwas undergoing the ordeal of \"hard times\"--a phrase, by the way, which I\r\nhave had dinned into my ears almost incessantly as far back as I can\r\nremember. Besides, although I could not help knowing that the States\r\nhave been peopled by Europeans, I was hardly prepared to find Americans\r\nproper--the descendants of Revolutionary ancestors--in such an appalling\r\nminority; and it certainly surprised me to find that Ireland and Germany\r\nwere responsible for so large a proportion of the population. When I\r\nwalked in the streets or visited the stores or public buildings\r\ndisillusion trod close on my heels: I was constantly accosting, or being\r\naccosted by, persons of Irish or German or other foreign nationality,\r\nwho, though displaying characteristics that somehow distinguished them\r\nfrom their countrymen in Europe, did not fall in with my ideal of the\r\nAmerican people. I do not mean precisely that they fell short of that\r\nideal, but simply that \"the shoe wouldn't fit,\" to use a common\r\nexpression. I began at last, in my bewilderment, to inquire whether\r\nthere were any Yankees in or about Boston, anyhow; and thus it\r\ntranspired that after a few days \"prospecting\" I finally transferred\r\nmyself and my fortunes from Boston to old Cambridge, where, it is\r\nneedless to say, I found plenty of the genuine American article that had\r\nbeen the object of my quest.\r\n\r\nAfter some time--in the course of which I succeeded in making myself\r\nknown to three or four of the college professors and tutors--I was told\r\nby one of them of a gentleman who, he thought, might be able to help me\r\nin obtaining employment. He is a man of genius and good-nature, and\r\nthrough him I got really useful introductions. From this time there were\r\nno _external_ difficulties in my way, beyond those experienced by many\r\nother men around me who had been on the lookout for vacancies for months\r\nbefore I had become one of their anxious number. But differences of\r\ntraining and experience remained to constitute real and very serious\r\nobstacles, although--and let me say it here, as I shall have plenty of\r\noccasion to grumble further on--the chief deterring or exclusive\r\ninfluence I ever suffered from in Boston or Cambridge was that of a\r\nkindness so much in excess of my capacity to make fair returns that I\r\nhad often to flinch from accepting it. Literary and professional men in\r\nthose twin-cities come nearer, to my thinking, to Wieland's cosmopolites\r\n(_Die Abderiten_) than any other class of people I know.\r\n\r\nBut let us to school. I may as well say at once that I never at any\r\ntime, while in the United States, commanded salaries (or incomes) equal\r\nto some I had received in England; and I am now more than ever convinced\r\nof the fact that England offers an unequalled field for a teacher of\r\nability and perseverance, always provided that he is as competent an\r\nauthority on cricket and boating as he is on Greek particles and the\r\nworking of the differential calculus. I speak, of course, simply of the\r\nordinary university graduate, who (like myself), not being from\r\npatrician ranks or Mammon-blessed, must hew out a position for himself\r\nwithout any aid from the patronage of influential friends or relatives.\r\nGiven a moderate amount of classical and mathematical stock in trade,\r\ntogether with correct personal habits and fair capacity for imparting\r\ninstruction, and an English teacher who adds to these qualifications\r\nsome skill in the chief bodily pastimes, may go on his way in peace: he\r\nshall have his reward. Let me add, however, that if he is a man of\r\nramshackle tendencies, the offices of drill-sergeant, cricket-referee\r\nand supervisor of table-etiquette which he has to combine with his\r\nordinary tutorial duties will in time become so irksome--especially if\r\nit is his lot to fall upon inferior schools--that he will be disposed to\r\nsacrifice all his pecuniary advantages and chances of unlimited\r\npromotion for the sake of a little peace of mind and unhampered leisure.\r\n\r\nMy readers are not to suppose that my object is to institute a full\r\ncomparison between the schools of England and the United States: I have\r\nnot the wide experience of American schools that would justify me in\r\nattempting such a task. For instance, although I have made a careful\r\nstudy of the working methods and interior economy of the common schools\r\nof the three American cities in which I have exercised my\r\nvocation--namely, Boston, New York and Philadelphia--I have never taught\r\nin the public schools; and any survey of the educational facilities of\r\nthe country that leaves them out would resemble a performance of\r\n_Hamlet_ with the role of the prince omitted. Nevertheless, my brief\r\nsojourn here has been a chequered and, in some respects, an amusing one;\r\nand any one who chooses to hear my record of it may add as much salt as\r\nhe pleases, for I promise to be perfectly frank in my utterances.\r\n\r\nI obtained my first pupils by answering a newspaper advertisement--I\r\nhave already named the three cities which my experience covers--and they\r\nconsisted of two young ladies, aged respectively eighteen and twenty-two\r\nyears. Their education had been thoroughly neglected, or, rather, they\r\nhad idled away the golden chances of their youth, and now their\r\nignorance, for ladies of their social standing, was astonishing. But\r\nmark the anomaly: had they been Englishwomen of the same rank and\r\nsimilarly uneducated, they would have been uncouth and ungrammatical in\r\nspeech, awkward in manner and dowdy in dress. There is no people upon\r\nwhom the transforming, refining effects of a thorough training are so\r\nmarked--because, it must be confessed, the native soil so much needs\r\ncultivation--as upon the English people. But these girls were ladylike\r\nin manner, tastefully dressed, and their speech was entirely free from\r\nthe barbarisms of an uneducated Englishwoman's language: I hasten to\r\nadd, however, that I would sooner have the Englishwoman for a pupil. Two\r\nEnglishwomen who required assistance from a private tutor would submit\r\nin patience to a prolonged course of laborious and irksome work, all\r\nunmindful of the doings of society and the absorbing interests of the\r\nhour, so long as the ultimate object was some day attained. My fair\r\nAmericans were undoubtedly intelligent, and even spasmodically\r\nhard-working, but their impatience of sustained, systematic work,\r\ncombined with--or rather caused by--their devotion to social pleasures,\r\nnot one of which they would forego on any consideration, prevented them\r\nfrom reaping any appreciable benefit. I instance their case, not because\r\nit was the first or the only one of the kind that fell into my hands,\r\nbut because it revealed to me at the outset a trait of the American\r\ncharacter--especially of the women--which confronted me at every turn of\r\nthe road afterward; namely, _a want of repose_--a defect which would\r\nseem to be largely accountable for the insensibility manifested by a\r\ngreat portion of the American young women of the middle classes to the\r\nfact that they have advantages at school such as their sisters in\r\nEngland would accept in an ecstasy of gratitude.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of my first summer I was advised to try one of the\r\nschool \"agencies\" that abound in the larger cities, especially in New\r\nYork; and I accordingly registered myself in the best-known and most\r\nwidely-recommended office. Perhaps it may be of interest to the reader\r\nunversed in such matters to learn what are the conditions on which an\r\nagent undertakes to introduce an applicant to persons wishing a teacher.\r\nTo begin, the teacher fills up a \"form of application\" by naming his\r\nqualifications and references, and affixing his signature to the\r\ncontract between him and the agent, the terms of which are as follows:\r\n\"Registration for one year, two dollars in advance; commission, four and\r\na half per cent. of salary or income for one year only--board, when\r\nincluded in compensation, to be rated at two hundred dollars for the\r\nschool-year. This commission is due as soon as the engagement is made.\"\r\nIn the printed receipt which is handed the applicant there is a curt,\r\nbusiness-like recapitulation of all the conditions, in which occurs the\r\nfollowing memorandum: \"I shall give you notice of vacancies as they\r\noccur which, _in my judgment_, seem suited to your wishes and\r\nqualifications.\" The italics are my own. An admirable loophole of\r\nretreat, truly: \"in my judgment\"! When a despondent candidate wakes up\r\nmorning after morning for months to read in the newspapers over the\r\nsignature of his agent such an advertisement as this: \"Engagements for\r\nthe fall term now being made. Many teachers wanted. Capable persons\r\nshould not delay in coming forward,\"--it is no doubt consoling to him to\r\ninfer that had the \"judgment\" perceived him to be suited for any of\r\nthese presumably numerous vacancies, he would certainly have had the\r\njudgment's dictum to that effect.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a year I received notices of two vacancies. One was the\r\nprincipalship of a boarding-school somewhere in West Virginia, in which\r\nI should have to realize what income I might from the payments for board\r\nat a rate prescribed by the patrons of the establishment. The difficulty\r\nwith me in this case was that before I came near the question, \"What are\r\nthe chances of success in such an undertaking?\" the previous question\r\npresented itself as even more difficult: \"Where am I to get the money\r\nwith which to make the attempt?\" The other vacancy was a mastership in a\r\nschool in Portland, Oregon. My health has always been robust, especially\r\nsince my deliverance from the Centennial and solar fervors of 1875 and\r\n1876, and therefore I had no desire to try the paradisiacal climate of\r\nthe uttermost West; but, nevertheless, I wrote twice, at an interval of\r\na month, to the address with which I had been furnished, and at last\r\nreceived a letter from a bishop's wife, intimating that \"there must be\r\nsome mistake: no vacancy had occurred in that institution for many\r\nmonths.\" _Quis declarabit?_ A mistake or a myth?\r\n\r\nNow, as no American will deny that there are a few things which are\r\nbetter managed in England than in the United States, I submit that the\r\nmethod of bringing teacher and employer into communication by means of a\r\nprofessional agent is one of these things. At all events, there is\r\nnothing equivocal about the English method. Let the reader judge for\r\nhimself from the following details: (1) The registration-fee is one\r\nshilling, not eight (two dollars). (2) The commission--generally five\r\nper cent.--is payable, not as soon as an engagement is made, but at the\r\nend of the first half year of service, and _provided only that there is\r\nto be a continuance of the engagement_: surely a beneficent provision\r\nfor the poor teacher. (3) One cannot travel very far in Britain: for ten\r\ndollars one can go from London to John O'Groat's. (4) Vacancies are\r\nannounced by bulletin in the office as they occur, and a notification is\r\nsent by post to distant registered candidates: secrecy in regard to the\r\nwhereabouts and emoluments of a position is quite unnecessary, because\r\nthe principals who patronize--or, rather, hire--the agent will employ\r\nteachers only through him. (5) A teacher is never asked the contemptible\r\nquestion, \"How much salary do you expect?\" The amount of salary\r\nattached, together with a description of the duties of the position, is\r\nset down in the notification. (6) The agent is simply an introducer: he\r\nof course has to be satisfied, _before_ the registration of the\r\napplicant, that the latter is really a teacher and a man of character,\r\nbut beyond that the \"judgment\" part of the business is relegated to the\r\nprincipal who receives the application.\r\n\r\nReverting again to my first summer, I have a little incident to relate:\r\nOne evening I was introduced to a middle-aged, sharp-looking little\r\nman, who, I was informed, was the principal of a flourishing college in\r\na Western State--a college in a town, both of which he had himself\r\nfounded. This gentleman and I managed to spend the evening together\r\npleasantly enough, but my astonishment was great next morning when I\r\nreceived a letter from him offering me a situation in his establishment.\r\nI had an interview with him, and concluding from all the appearances\r\nthat the location was a healthy and civilized one, the school a\r\nprosperous one, and himself an energetic, cultivated gentleman, I was on\r\nthe point of accepting, when it suddenly occurred to me that in my\r\nanxiety to learn whether the position was desirable in other respects\r\nnot a word had been said on the subject of salary. My expressing a wish\r\nto be enlightened upon this important particular produced an immediate\r\nhitch in the negotiations, but the practical upshot was that the greater\r\npart of my salary was to consist virtually of unreclaimed land! Since\r\nthat magnificent occasion I have regarded with magnanimous forbearance\r\nrequisitions emanating from that portion of the West.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, my answer to an advertisement was successful, and in\r\nSeptember I was duly installed as teacher of the classics in a school of\r\nsome fifty boys in one of the three cities I have mentioned. The\r\nfollowing extract from the principal's letter of engagement will show\r\nwhat is naturally the chief difficulty an English teacher has to\r\nencounter in his search for an employer in the United States: \"On the\r\nwhole, I think the most favorably of you out of some forty applicants;\r\nthe only fear I have arising from the well-known fact that American lads\r\nare so unlike those of the old country, and require different methods of\r\ndiscipline.\"\r\n\r\nThe salary, though a moderate one--not by a third equal to salaries in\r\nEnglish schools of the same grade--was yet reasonable; and when it is\r\nadded that it was a day-school; that there was held only one session of\r\nfive hours, with a roomy interval for lunch, gymnastics and music; that\r\neach teacher had a large, well-furnished and cleanly-kept room to\r\nhimself--a luxury which is rare in the best English schools; that each\r\ndepartment was under the charge of a separate teacher, who was never\r\nrequired to step out of his own special walk--another school-virtue not\r\ncommon in English schools; that the principal fulfilled my ideal of a\r\ncalm, judicious and discriminating headmaster,--it is no wonder that I\r\nbegan to congratulate myself upon having at last fallen upon a school\r\nthat furnished a combination of what I consider the best features of\r\nboth the English and Scotch schools, to the exclusion of all that is\r\ndetestable and soul-harassing in either. \"No more for me,\" I\r\nsoliloquized, \"of presiding magisterially at the odious dinner-table, at\r\nwhich not a whisper is tolerated, and even the irrepressible chuckle\r\nover some accident to the earthenware is accounted a crime; no more of\r\nsolemn marching in procession on Sunday morning and evening to some\r\nfantastic, farcical 'High Church,' whose funereal-mummeries served only\r\nto mask the furtive deviltries of the brisker members of my charge; no\r\nmore onsets at tea-time, when returned home with the boys from an\r\nexhausting walk, of infuriated farmers demanding vengeance for rifled\r\norchards and shattered fences; no more morning calls from elderly maiden\r\nladies in neighboring summer boarding-houses, reporting a hail of shot\r\nfrom ubiquitous catapults during the night-watches; no more sitting up\r\no' nights, when on duty for the day, reading with the drones against the\r\napproaching Oxford or Cambridge 'local,' and rushing stealthily up\r\nstairs every now and then to pounce upon the perpetrators of hideous\r\ncatcalls.\" All this I had escaped from, and more. And now what a\r\ncontrast! Saturdays and Sundays were my own, and I could worship in the\r\nHebrew or Mohammedan temple, just as I chose; and for the rest of the\r\nweek I should have all day, after four hours' pleasant culling of\r\nHoratian and Homeric flowers, to devote to some abstruse study, perhaps\r\nlocal politics.\r\n\r\nAs if any one should expect perfection or perfect satisfaction (which is\r\nthe same thing) in this wicked, cross-grained world! First of all,\r\nalthough it came last of all, it transpired toward the end of the year\r\nthat the school was not paying, and the teachers (of whom there were by\r\nfar too many) were warned that they would have to be satisfied with half\r\nsalaries during the remainder of the school-year. This blow did not fall\r\nvery heavily on any one but myself, as all the other teachers had\r\nengagements in other schools, as well as friends and relatives\r\nthroughout the city. The boys were very fickle: a succession of bad\r\naverages on their weekly reports would send them off in high dudgeon to\r\nsome other school; and though there were fresh accessions taking place\r\nfrom time to time, the frequent interchanging was injurious alike to the\r\ntone of the school and to the school exchequer. There were, too, one or\r\ntwo bad boys who should have been expelled, but whose expulsion would\r\nhave lost to the school their independent sympathizers as well, and so\r\nwould have seriously embarrassed the finances. An American principal\r\nwith a bevy of \"free and independent\" youths to cater for is in an\r\ninconceivably different position from his English _confrere_, who is\r\nempowered to read his pupils' weekly letters to their parents and to\r\nsend a policeman in pursuit of any runaway malcontent among them. From\r\nthe moment an English boy leaves his father's house he is under the\r\ncomplete control of his principal, and consequently a ruinous veering\r\nabout from school to school is effectually prevented, while the\r\nretention of a decidedly vicious boy would obviously be a most\r\nunprofitable policy. I have seen a rich English parent bring back his\r\ntruant offspring to be soundly flogged in presence of his grinning\r\nschoolmates--an ugly spectacle, and now happily a rare one in England;\r\nbut the reverse of the picture, though far less shocking, is by no means\r\npleasantly suggestive. I have heard an American lady express her\r\nsurprise to a principal, with unmistakable tartness in her tone, that\r\nher son, who was at once the idlest and most troublesome boy in his\r\nclass, always brought home averages of sixty or seventy, \"when young\r\nA----, who lives next us, and is considered quite a slow boy, receives\r\nninety and over every time. _Don't_ you think there must be some\r\nmistake, or--or unfairness--in the marking?\"\r\n\r\nOnly ten of my sixteen boys had been in the school before that year, and\r\nof those ten only four had passed through the regular curriculum of the\r\nschool from the primary department to the graduating class. Those four\r\nwere notably the most advanced and the only thoroughly-grounded boys of\r\nthe sixteen. A few of the others had attended nearly all the private\r\nschools in the city, while two of them had been oscillating between the\r\npublic and private schools for years at their own sweet wills, and could\r\nnever decide whether the commercial or classical department of the\r\nschool in question was the one for which they were best fitted. It may\r\nwell be understood, therefore, what a medley my classes presented, and\r\nhow unlikely it was, in the face of all these drawbacks, that their\r\nacquirements should be above mediocrity. On the score of natural\r\nabilities, however--in quickness of perception, facility in\r\ngeneralization, readiness and coherence of expression, and clearness of\r\nhead generally--it would not be at haphazard one could find an equal\r\nnumber of boys in any English school to match them.\r\n\r\nAs to the vexed subject of discipline, my experience leads me to say\r\nthat, provided I was left to my own way, I would rather manage a class\r\nof twenty American boys than of twenty English. The common cry about\r\nYoung America's disrespect for authority or worth seems to me to be\r\nfounded on a misconception, when, indeed, it is anything but the wailing\r\nof ignorance or cant. I am strongly possessed of a belief that American\r\nchildren know intuitively where respect is really due, and that there\r\nthey fully and unhesitatingly award it. I at least have found among them\r\na more genuine, spontaneous sentiment of regard for their teachers than\r\neither in England or Scotland--a sentiment utterly free from the\r\ncringing submissiveness which too often passes muster in England as a\r\njuvenile virtue. However feared--and, _accordingly_, respected--an\r\nEnglish teacher may be by his scholars, he is nevertheless an ogre to\r\nmost of them--to the aristocrat a plebeian pedagogue to whom he must\r\ndefer, just as, when he is a little older and sports a scarlet tunic, he\r\nmust submit to the unlettered sergeant-major who teaches him his\r\ngoose-step; to the rich _parvenu_ more intolerable still, as the pruner\r\nof his obtrusive vulgarities of speech and manner, the index of his\r\nsocial inferiority and the standing menace to his innate rudeness, that\r\nis only intensified by his consciousness of wealth; to the poor man's\r\nson essentially a \"schoolmaster\"--a wielder of the ferule and a\r\nbloodless automaton, to whom, as Southey wrote,\r\n\r\n    The multiplication-table is his creed,\r\n    His paternoster and his decalogue;\r\n\r\nto only the emancipated and discerning few what he really is at his\r\nbest--their greatest earthly friend and benefactor. All I have seen of\r\nAmerican schoolboys impresses me that the feeling which dictates their\r\nbearing toward their teachers is born of a clear-sighted and intuitive\r\nappreciation of superior knowledge, worth or experience, and not of\r\nconventional observance or necessity. It is generally said abroad that\r\nAmerican children are unruly, forward and irreverent toward their\r\nparents and elders; and one reason assigned is that parents are careless\r\nof teaching their children the little ceremonies and graduated\r\nformalities of speech, \"in which,\" as an English bishop recently alleged\r\nin an after-dinner speech, \"there is embodied so much wholesome\r\ndiscipline that a careful attendance to the practice of them gives the\r\nyoung man or woman an advantage not offered by any other method of\r\ntraining.\" Spartan, but indigestible! A keener observer than the\r\nbishop--the heresiarch Thackeray--wrote in his _Philip_: \"I never saw\r\npeople on better terms with each other, more frank, affectionate and\r\ncordial, than the parents and the grown-up young folks in the United\r\nStates;\" and certain it is that the description is applicable to the\r\nintercourse between teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nThe faults of the latter are aimlessness and impatience; and their\r\nmisfortune--which is largely responsible for those faults--is that they\r\nare too soon allowed to plunge into the quagmire called by euphemism\r\n\"society,\" and often whelmed in its sorry pleasures and petty\r\nambitions--too soon, also, invested with the right to manage their own\r\naffairs and to choose their own associates, advisers, and even\r\ninstructors; in a word, permitted to breathe the invigorating spirit of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence before their constitutions are fitted\r\nfor its reception. This may sound trite enough, but I see no other way\r\nof accounting for the intellectual--and, alas! moral--failure of so many\r\nof the brilliantly-gifted lads whom I have known and loved in these\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI might proceed to give a few illustrations of this resultless\r\nrestlessness, this dissipation of the youthful forces, to which I have\r\nalluded; but there is one phase of my experience here which goes further\r\nto prove its prevalence and baneful effects than a thousand instances\r\nderived from my knowledge of boys in school or in the closer contact of\r\nprivate tuition. From time to time there appear in the \"Instruction\"\r\ncolumn of the daily newspapers advertisements like the following:\r\n\"Wanted, lessons in the evenings by a gentleman of neglected education;\"\r\n\"Wanted, lessons in grammar and conversation (_sic_) by a married\r\ncouple.\" It was by answering such advertisements as these that I fell\r\nupon the most satisfactory portion of my labors in this country, and met\r\nwith pupils of both sexes the memory of whom will be to me a source of\r\npride as well as of pleasure as long as I live. Ladies and gentleman of\r\ngood social standing they were, who, bitterly regretting neglected early\r\nopportunities, had the moral courage to \"go to school\"--with the wise\r\nmeekness and receptiveness engendered in fine natures by ultimate\r\nself-disparagement--even when their avocations seemed to preclude the\r\npossibility of sustained and fruitful study. But when I contemplate a\r\nlong array of such pupils (covering a period of three years)--from the\r\nyoung banker's clerk or embryo lawyer chagrined with himself because of\r\nthe poor figure he cut at last week's party, and commendably determined\r\nto try and remedy his defects, to the mature business- or even\r\nprofessional-man, humiliated because his accomplished wife's every\r\nsentence made him feel ashamed of his squandered youth, and so\r\nconstrained, at the eleventh hour, to employ a private tutor--it is\r\ndifficult for me not to recognize that in a country where the children\r\nenjoy so many privileges, where they are taught regularly,\r\nsystematically, patiently, conscientiously--where, in short, everything\r\nis taught, and everything is taught well--there must be some mistake in\r\nthe exercise of the parental guardianship that creates and fosters the\r\naimlessness and impatience which prevent so many of the children from\r\nreaping adequate benefit from their noble heritage.\r\n\r\nOne thing that occasioned me a good deal of trouble and anxiety in my\r\nfirst school was the system of \"marking\" for each lesson with a view to\r\nobtaining a weekly average standard. Not that I was unused to the\r\nmethod, but I had never before seen it pushed to such an extent nor\r\npursued on exactly the same principle. A boy would be marked up by his\r\nvarious teachers in about a dozen subjects during the week, and on\r\nFriday a printed slip would be handed him showing his weekly average in\r\neach subject and in all the subjects taken together. An average of 95\r\nper cent. was quite common; 80 was not in high favor; 70 was shaky,\r\nwhile 60 was quite bad. A quarter's experience of it convinced me that\r\nthe thing was a piece of abominable red tape: I do not mean in theory,\r\nbut in the results of its working in that particular case. I had seen\r\nboys and men in school and college in England and Scotland obtain\r\n\"first-class honors\" with a mark of 75, and I now marvelled how it\r\nhappened that boys who had but a faint idea of what hard work really\r\nmeant were able to produce such brilliant results, more especially when\r\nso much of their time and attention was devoted to the preparation of\r\norations and dialogues, and even to the rehearsal of private theatricals\r\n(the principal would have gone crazy had any one presumed to call them\r\nby that name in his hearing) for the approaching \"entertainment,\" two of\r\nwhich treats were offered \"_by the school_\" (a great deal in those three\r\nwords) to the public during the year. I may mention that on these two\r\noccasions it was the part of the principal to ascend the stage during\r\nthe _entr'acte_ and read off from a paper he held in his hand a few\r\nparticulars regarding those precious averages which seemed in the\r\nspeaker's and hearers' minds to be exactly commensurate with the\r\nstanding and progress of the pupils.\r\n\r\nMy marking made me for some time rather unpopular; and beginning at last\r\nto follow the time-honored injunction, \"When you are in Rome do as the\r\nRomans do,\" I hoisted my boys from the sixties and seventies to the more\r\nplausible eighties and nineties. It was, no doubt, an unprincipled thing\r\nto do, but I soothed my outraged conscience with the thought that I was\r\nmaking a martyr of myself--that when the examination-week arrived the\r\nexaminers' reports would confound me by exposing the difference between\r\nmy paper and their gold. The examination-week did arrive, of course, and\r\nI found that I was to be myself the examiner of my classes. Let not the\r\nreader think that I would be pleasantly satiric when I say that not till\r\nthen did I fully awake to the fruitful meaning of the expression,\r\n\"American independence.\" And neither let him infer that I take such a\r\nschool to be a representative American high-class school: I only say\r\nthat it is a fair representative of a class of schools that is both\r\nnumerous and popular in the cities I have named above. Here, indeed, was\r\nan application of the _sui-juris_ principle that, though it certainly\r\neased my feeling of apprehension and doubt as to the probable results of\r\nthe examination, yet filled me with a vague sense of dissatisfaction.\r\nAnd the reason is not far to seek: my English training would naturally\r\nhave the effect of making me look for a verdict on my work not to my own\r\nnotebook, nor even to the principal's returns, but to some higher and\r\nextra-mural authority who should test the attainments of the pupils and\r\nthe efficiency of the school by a searching and impartial examination.\r\n\r\nIn English middle-class schools the advent of the \"Oxford and Cambridge\r\nSchools Examination Board\" is regarded with no small anxiety by\r\nprincipals, masters and scholars alike. It marks an epoch in their\r\nlives, and is the only period of the year in which there is anything\r\nlike a _rapprochement_ between them, as if in the presence of some\r\nimminent crisis. The eccentric jackanapes who is by turns the butt and\r\nwitling of the school stands for once consciously on equal terms with\r\nhis principal, and can for once even \"cheek\" the school-bully with\r\nperfect impunity. All is excitement, anticipation, preparation and much\r\nconsuming of midnight oil. Perhaps a very brief account, in conclusion,\r\nof the methods of procedure in these examinations may interest the\r\nreader; and in case he should think that my object in offering my sketch\r\nis to draw an invidious comparison between the English and American\r\nmethods of examination, I refer him to an animated and interesting\r\ncorrespondence in the April issue of the _Nation_ between President\r\nEliot of Harvard and Professor Adams of Michigan University--a\r\ndiscussion in which the former gentleman enthusiastically claims for the\r\nEnglish method a degree of excellence which the most ardent home\r\nadvocates of the system--who know its _working_ faults as well as its\r\npositive advantages--would hesitate to claim for it.\r\n\r\nThe English board holds two kinds of examinations: First, examinations\r\nof schools for the benefit of schools exclusively, and having no effect\r\nto admit individuals to the universities or to exempt them from\r\nsubsequent examinations, whether at the universities or elsewhere;\r\nsecond, examinations of individuals for certificates which give\r\nexemption from the entrance-examinations at Oxford and Cambridge, from\r\nthe earliest examinations of the university course, and from the\r\npreliminary examinations of certain professional bodies. The\r\nexaminations cover thirty-four different and carefully-specified\r\nsubjects (no candidate taking the whole), and on the average two hours\r\nare allowed for writing answers to the questions in each subject; the\r\nexaminations last from eight to twelve days, and are held three times in\r\nthe year; and the schedule of days, subjects and hours for each year is\r\npublished nearly a year in advance. The decision of the board is upon\r\nthe individual: \"Has he passed a satisfactory examination in a\r\nsufficient number of subjects?\" and the board takes no account whatever\r\nof the opinions and certificates of school-authorities concerning the\r\nindividual. A printed report is annually made by the board, showing the\r\nname of each person who obtained a certificate, the subjects in which he\r\nsatisfied the examiners, and the school from which he came. The\r\nexaminations are conducted in writing for all the subjects, but for a\r\nfew subjects oral examinations are superadded. The questions are\r\nprinted; they are the same for every candidate in any given subject; and\r\nthey are made public when the examinations are over. In order to secure\r\nuniformity of standard at the examinations, the results obtained at the\r\ndifferent places of examination are compared by the central board of\r\nexaminers. Each candidate pays a fee of two pounds, and from these fees\r\neach examiner is liberally paid for every day of service spent in\r\nsetting questions, attending the examinations and looking over the\r\nanswers of candidates.\r\n\r\nThere never was a method of examination without its drawbacks, and the\r\nchief weakness of the English system is that it tends to excite a spirit\r\nof rivalry which is apt to resort for aid to cramming processes. As yet,\r\nhowever, the examinations have been conducted in such a manner that the\r\nspecial \"cramming-schools\"--of which there are not a few--have very\r\ngenerally come to grief, even when they have had successes before the\r\nexaminers for the civil service.\r\n\r\n     D. C. MACDONALD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN PRESS.\r\n\r\nIn its present form Russian journalism is a kind of geological diagram,\r\nthe primary strata being typified by the ministerial organs (the\r\n_Russian Invalid_ and the _Northern Bee_) and their shadow the _Journal\r\nde St. Petersbourg_; the transition period by the _Voice_ (_Golos_) and\r\nthe _Moscow Gazette_; and the more advanced ages by the _Russian World_\r\n(_Russki Mir_). The last, although dating back only to the Franco-German\r\nwar, has already made itself conspicuous for the exceptional accuracy of\r\nits information, the wide range of its topics and the frank and manly\r\ntone of its criticism. Thanks to it and to its two great forerunners\r\nabove mentioned, the utterances of Russian journalism carry with them\r\nmore weight than they would otherwise do--a result materially aided by\r\nthe decay of the censorship, the worst and meanest legacy of Russia's\r\ndark ages, which has lately had a chance of showing itself as absurd as\r\nit is hateful under the congenial guidance of General Schidlovski. The\r\nrulers of the empire have begun to perceive that it is hardly worth\r\nwhile to hire men at exorbitant prices to deface articles which they\r\ncannot read and condemn books which they cannot understand; and the\r\ncommon sense of Russia has long since revolted against a system which is\r\nstill as uselessly and childishly vexatious as when pilloried in\r\nimperishable language a century ago by Beaumarchais.\r\n\r\nThis is a great deal, but it is not enough. Like many other native\r\ninstitutions, Russian journalism is merely a fine fragment. Russia has a\r\nmultitude of ships, but no navy; a number of ministers, but no\r\ngovernment; a host of journals, but no press. The Russian daily papers\r\n(with the exception of an occasional \"double edition\" on the part of the\r\n_Bourse Gazette_) consist of a single broadsheet, the large type of\r\nwhich reduces its contents to a minimum. Fully one-half of this limited\r\nspace is usually occupied with advertisements and official\r\nannouncements, while even the few remaining columns are often deplorably\r\nmisused. One detestable custom, originally borrowed from France, is that\r\nof \"padding\" a journal with tenth-rate novels, pointless anecdotes and\r\nwould-be humorous _feuilletons_, such as the weakest \"comic annual\"\r\nwould decline without thanks. Another failing of Russian journalism is\r\nits fondness for the _tu-quoque_ style of argument, retorting every\r\nmention of Poland by an allusion to Ireland. But, despite all this,\r\nthere is much hope for the future of Russian journalism. It is no slight\r\ngain that, in a country which has long been regarded as the very\r\nincarnation of truth-stifling despotism, any journal should be found to\r\nspeak as the _Golos_ recently spoke on the question of Russia's naval\r\nforces: \"The Crimean war, which tried so severely the qualities of our\r\narmy, cannot be said to have tested those of our fleet, inasmuch as it\r\nnever gave itself a chance of being tested. At the first approach of the\r\nenemy it hastened to shelter itself behind the forts of Cronstadt,\r\nwhence it never emerged till the close of the war. Now, if the sole use\r\nof the navy upon which we yearly expend millions of roubles be to shrink\r\nout of harm's way at the first sign of danger, we might just as well\r\nhave no navy at all.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the journals above named, the Moscow _Son of the Fatherland_ and\r\ntwo others published in the capital (the _Birjeviya Vedomosti_, or\r\n_Bourse Gazette_, and the _Peterburgskiya Vedomosti_, or _St. Petersburg\r\nGazette_), though now eclipsed by their younger rivals, formerly held a\r\nhigh place among Russian dailies. The Russian magazines cannot be dealt\r\nwith in the limited space of the present article: it must suffice to\r\nmention the two most important--namely: the _Russki Vestnik_ (_Russian\r\nCourier_) and the _Vestnik Yevropi_ (_Courier of Europe_). Several of\r\nM. Tourgueneff's later stories have made their first appearance in the\r\npages of the latter, which, numbering among its contributors some of the\r\nforemost writers in Russia, and combining, like the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_, the functions of a review with those of a magazine, is in every\r\nway the worthy successor of its now defunct forerunner, the\r\n_Sovremennik_ (_Contemporary_), formerly owned and edited by the poet\r\nNekrassoff.[B]\r\n\r\nThe comic element of Russian journalism is represented by the _Iskra_\r\n(_Spark_) and _Budilnik_ (_Alarm-Bell_), the latter having the\r\nsuperiority in pictorial illustrations, though the savage and personal\r\ncast of its satire, together with its imprudent fondness for political\r\nallusions, has more than once all but occasioned its suppression. Both\r\njournals are published weekly, and both have a considerable circulation,\r\nthough it must be owned that their title of \"comic\" is for the most part\r\na sad misnomer. That the Russians are naturally devoid of humor no\r\nreader of Gogol or Griboiedoff, Pushkin, Kriloff or Tourgueneff, can\r\nbelieve; but the comic journals themselves have fallen far too much into\r\nthe hands of the Imperial University, whose literary style is a\r\ncombination of the humor of the cider-cellars with the verbal fluency of\r\nBillingsgate. Under such auspices the ill-starred periodicals naturally\r\noscillate between insipid propriety and labored coarseness. For a month\r\nor two the talented contributors go smoothly on in their career of\r\nuntranslatable pleasantry, till some special atrocity calls forth the\r\nfatherly admonition of the police. Immediately a reaction ensues,\r\nfilling the objectionable columns with harmless sneers at the weather\r\nand other safe objects of attack, until the effect of the warning has\r\ndied away, and all goes on as before.\r\n\r\nThose of our readers who were in Russia a few years ago must remember\r\nthe famous caricature of \"National Music,\" representing the various\r\njournals as a band of musicians. In the foreground stands the minister\r\nof police as bandmaster, regulating the time with the flourish of his\r\nbaton: on his right is the _Russian Invalid_ (the government organ) with\r\na trombone, on his left the _Military Gazette_ with a kettledrum.\r\nImmediately below, the _Moscow Gazette_, in the person of its celebrated\r\nchief, M. Katkoff, is playing in a reckless, haphazard fashion upon an\r\nenormous bass fiddle. Close by are the two leading comic journals, the\r\none tinkling a triangle, the other blowing the pandean pipes. Farther on\r\nthe _Voice_ (_Golos_) is bawling through a speaking-trumpet, and the\r\n_Bourse Gazette_ flourishing a tambourine, a host of minor performers\r\nbeing loosely sketched in the background; while far in the distance a\r\nhand outstretched from a cloud of mist is tolling a cracked church-bell,\r\nsymbolical of M. Kerzen's famous _Kolokol_ (_Bell_), at that time in the\r\nzenith of its sinister renown; and Russia, as a young lady in a\r\nball-dress, is vainly attempting, with a look of dismay, to close her\r\nears against the uproar.\r\n\r\nEqually clever and equally audacious is a more recent travesty of the\r\nwell-known scene in Dante's _Inferno_ where Bertrand de Born, a noted\r\nsower of sedition, comes forth with his severed head in his hands. In\r\nthe Russian version the renowned editor of the _Moscow Gazette_ is seen\r\nhobbling along with a cannon-ball labelled \"Police Surveillance\" at his\r\nankle, and carrying by the hair his own head, which is so drawn as to\r\nbear a grotesque likeness to an inkstand with a pen in each ear. The\r\ntext of Dante is thus travestied:\r\n\r\n    And by the hair he with despairing look\r\n    Upheld his head, which cried to me, \"Oh woe!\r\n    Himself is his own inkstand! Thus are two\r\n    In one tormented.\"\r\n\r\nThe backwardness of the Russian press, attributed to so many different\r\ncauses, is really due to one very simple one--the want of readers. Among\r\na population of whom only nine per cent. can read, and who neither know\r\nnor care what passes in the world of politics, the existence of free\r\npublic opinion, or indeed of any opinion at all, can hardly be expected;\r\nand thus, while no country contains such frantic republicans as Russia,\r\nno government is more absolutely secure. Upon that tremendous passivity\r\nthe utmost efforts of such men as Netchaieff and Bakounin fall like a\r\npellet on the hide of an elephant. The popular cries which madden other\r\nraces are utterly meaningless to the docile, unemotional \"mujik,\" loyal\r\nand conservative to the very marrow of his bones.\r\n\r\nBut the vivifying of these petrified millions may safely be left to the\r\ninfluence of time. The provincial schools recently established may be\r\ntrusted to do their work, however slowly; and the \"educated Russia\"\r\ndreamed of by Alexander I. may yet crown the age of Alexander II. Those\r\nwho, like the writer, have lived in the villages of the interior, and\r\nhave seen the Russian peasant as he really is, cannot but have hopes of\r\nhis future, in the teeth of the hasty and one-sided observers who love\r\nto depict him as a brute with the single human attribute of dishonesty.\r\nThe ignorance, sluggishness and intemperance of the mujik belong to the\r\nsystem under which he has been reared: his frank hospitality, cheery\r\ngood-humor and simple child-like piety are all his own. To raise these\r\nbrave, simple natures out of the unwholesome darkness which has so long\r\nimprisoned them is a noble and Christian work; as far above the mere\r\nmaterial emancipation of 1861 as the soul is above the body.\r\n\r\n     D. K.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MIDSUMMER NOON'S PHANTASM.\r\n\r\n\"Ghosts? No, I don't believe in ghosts: I have seen too many of them,\"\r\nis a very fair thing on one of the oldest of subjects. My case is\r\ndifferent. I have been trying all my life to believe in ghosts, and saw\r\nmy first four days ago. Toward noon I fell into a doze--very short and\r\nslight it must have been--over my book. No one was in the room, and the\r\ndoor was closed. The book was held up in the usual position, a little\r\nbelow the level of the eye, in the right hand. I awoke--if the word can\r\nbe applied to what was so very slight a slumber--and saw limned with\r\nperfect distinctness against the page the head of a girl or boy six or\r\neight years old, blue-eyed, light-haired, and fair but not clear in\r\ncomplexion. It was below life-size, not more than four inches in height.\r\nOnly the head was visible, without anything below the jaw. At first it\r\nseemed perfectly solid, but the lines of print, which were still held up\r\nas in reading, gradually showed themselves through the fading apparition\r\nuntil it entirely died away. This happened in about a third of a minute,\r\nthe beautiful little face continuing the whole time to gaze at me with a\r\ncalm but not sad expression. It was not in full front, the right side\r\nbeing turned to me in what is called a three-quarter position. The light\r\nwhich illuminated it did not come from the window, which was directly\r\nbehind me and gave all the light there was in the room, and yet the\r\nimpression was in no respect that of a picture. Not for a moment did\r\nthis interpretation occur to me, strongly as did the evanescent\r\ncharacter of the head militate against the idea of reality. The fading\r\nwas most rapid at the occiput, and may be said to have begun there,\r\nextending to the right and upward. There was no background or accessory\r\nof any kind, the head being quite isolated and detached, objectively as\r\nsubjectively.\r\n\r\nThe lineaments were not those of any one of my acquaintance, and\r\nrecalled no countenance I had ever seen. If the appearance suggested a\r\nyoung member of the family, it was not because of resemblance, but from\r\nhis being frequently in my mind, and apt to be associated with any alarm\r\ndue to the tinge of superstition from which none of us are wholly free.\r\nFor the reason already given it could not have been a reminiscence of a\r\npicture. The shading and coloring were too exact for anything painted.\r\nMy easel was, it is true, near by, on the opposite side of me, and on it\r\nwere two heads of nearly the size of that I describe; but they were\r\nhard-featured old saints of a deep mahogany hue, relieved by a very dark\r\nbackground, and therefore the exact antipodes of my shadowy visitant. On\r\nthese I had been painting an hour or two before; and that is the\r\nsolitary connection conceivable between the spectre and anything\r\ntangible. The reader will perhaps be inclined to set it down as having\r\nbeen complementary to them. I do not think it was; but were it so, the\r\npoint mainly craving explanation remains untouched--that what I saw was\r\nwith the waking eye. It may have come from the land of dreams, or from a\r\nremote outlying province of it, but its perceptible existence was\r\nentirely in the realm of actualities. I was not conscious, and had no\r\nrecollection, of having had a dream. It is true that, according to a\r\ntheory necessarily and in its nature incapable of being sustained by\r\npositive proof, we may have unconscious dreams, and be always dreaming\r\nwhen asleep without knowing it. Persons who rise at night, take pen and\r\npaper and solve problems which had been the worry of their waking hours,\r\nand return to their couch still asleep, present cases analogous to mine\r\nin so far as their unconscious mental activity leaves an outcome and\r\nexpression obvious to the senses. Another parallel would be that of a\r\nsleep-walking artist who should when in a state of somnambulism execute\r\na picture. But neither case would be identical in principle with mine.\r\nThe artist and the mathematician would both have executed in their sleep\r\nwhat they had laid the foundation of when awake. I, on the other hand,\r\nwould, should I transfer my aerial sitter to canvas, simply paint what I\r\nsaw when wide awake, just as in undertaking to reproduce any other face\r\nfrom memory, whether observed once for twenty seconds or frequently and\r\nfor longer periods.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to explain the common stories of phantoms by attributing\r\nthem to ocular illusion, aided or not aided by the imagination or by\r\nparticular conditions of the bodily or mental health. The eye, of\r\ncourse, is never quite proof against deception, but there needs some\r\nlittle material for it; and in my case there was absolutely none--no\r\nwaving sheet or trees or clouds, nothing but the printed page; and that\r\nwas visible, unchanged except by the utterly inharmonious and contrasted\r\nimage before it. My imagination was not affected before, at the time, or\r\nafter. My pulse may have been a little quickened for the moment, for I\r\ndid not accept the appearance as a matter of course, as we do\r\neverything, however preposterous, in a dream, but, on the contrary,\r\nquite recognized its abnormal character. I know of no existing cause of\r\nespecial or temporary liability to any delusion of the kind. In short,\r\nthough I have not--and had not when I continued after the disappearance\r\nto contemplate, without moving a muscle, the book against which the head\r\nhad been projected, and coolly reflect upon what I had seen--the\r\nslightest belief that it was supernatural, I should be compelled, if\r\ncalled on in court, to swear that I had seen what must be provisionally\r\nnamed a spectre. \"If I stand here, I saw it!\"\r\n\r\n     E. C. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTHPLACE OF \"GEORGE ELIOT.\"\r\n\r\nAs the traveller is whirled along over the great stretch of railway\r\nbetween Liverpool and London, he passes (about midway) through Nuneaton,\r\na busy little manufacturing town, situated in a most delightful and\r\nfruitful part of the \"Garden Land.\" About two miles from this town\r\n(which the gifted authoress has dubbed \"Milby\" in her _Scenes of\r\nClerical Life_), on the broad smooth highway leading to the ancient and\r\nrenowned city of Coventry, stands the house where Marian Evans was born.\r\nIt is a large brick building, surrounded by a well-stocked and pleasant\r\ngarden, devoid of ornament, but highly suggestive of comfort and\r\nconvenience--such a house as our forefathers used to build fifty years\r\nago, when comfort was not sacrificed to appearance, and when the owner\r\nhad more to do with the design than the architect.\r\n\r\nRobert Evans, the father of the renowned authoress, was bailiff to Lord\r\nHowe and to Sir Roger Newdigate--father of the present M. P. of that\r\nname, who is such an earnest champion of Protestantism as it is\r\nreflected in the Church of England, and who has made such earnest but as\r\nyet fruitless endeavors to have a bill passed for the periodical\r\nvisitation and inspection of the monastic and conventual institutions of\r\nGreat Britain. Her brother, Isaac P. Evans, still occupies that\r\nresponsible position, and resides in the old homestead. The country\r\naround Mrs. Lewes's early home is rich in historic associations. Not far\r\naway is Bosworth Field, and in another direction are the ruins of Astley\r\nCastle, within whose strong walls Lady Jane Grey passed a portion of her\r\nbrief, chequered life. Near the castle stands--or stood--a tree in which\r\nher father, the duke of Suffolk, took refuge when pursued by the\r\nemissaries of the sanguinary queen. A small table used by him while\r\nconcealed in the huge hollow trunk is still preserved.\r\n\r\nThere are several very ancient churches in the vicinity of the residence\r\nwhere George Eliot passed her early days. The parish church of Nuneaton,\r\nto which she alludes in her _Scenes of Clerical Life_, is a grand\r\nstructure, six hundred years old, with a massive embattled tower\r\ncontaining a chime of eight melodious bells; and Coton (Shepperton)\r\nChurch, which in her girlhood she attended with her parents, is perhaps\r\nstill more ancient, as it is certainly more weatherbeaten and venerable\r\nin appearance. The writer's parents have often seen the future authoress\r\nsitting in the antiquated, high-peaked family pew and taking part with\r\ngrave attention in the service.\r\n\r\nIn Atteborough, a village in the same neighborhood, there resided an\r\neccentric character named Joe Liggens. He had received a university\r\neducation, but, lacking application and industry, had chosen no pursuit\r\nin life, and passed his time in lounging around his native village and\r\nfrequenting the tap-room of its alehouse, where, surrounded by an\r\nadmiring crowd, he puffed away at his long pipe, removing it from his\r\nlips only when he deigned to express an opinion upon some subject of\r\ndebate and give his open-mouthed hearers the benefit of his wisdom and\r\nerudition. When _Scenes of Clerical Life_ first appeared in _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_, describing places and persons familiar to the villagers, they\r\nnaturally wondered who the author could be, and decided at last that it\r\ncould be no other than Joe Liggens. Had he not been to Oxford? Didn't he\r\nknow Latin and all sorts of things? And wasn't he acquainted with the\r\nscenes and personages described in the new book? No one else could be\r\nthought of combining these various and essential qualifications. When\r\nJoe was questioned on the subject he merely smiled and said nothing--the\r\nstrongest confirmatory proof, and an exhibition of the modesty inherent\r\nin genius. In recognition of the honor he had conferred upon his native\r\nplace, a subscription was started for the impecunious Joe, and a goodly\r\nsum was on the point of being presented to him when the real name of\r\n\"George Eliot\" was revealed, and Joe Liggens found himself treated as an\r\nimpostor by those who had thrust upon him undeserved honors.\r\n\r\n    W. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF SOUTH JERSEY.\r\n\r\nThe Camden and Atlantic, the Philadelphia and Atlantic City, the New\r\nJersey Southern, and some minor railroads, pass through portions of New\r\nJersey long known as the \"Jersey Barrens.\" They are all new roads,\r\ncomparatively speaking, but they have wonderfully stimulated the\r\nenterprise that has created so many flourishing villages that ten years\r\nago had never been heard of. Vineland, the fairest and most flourishing\r\nvillage in the country, as well as the largest, is only about fifteen\r\nyears old. Its population is six thousand. Forbidding-looking swamps,\r\ngiving rise to swarming myriads of mosquitoes and to malaria through\r\ntheir dank, decaying vegetation, have been converted into flourishing\r\ncranberry-meadows, and the dry land into fine vineyards and\r\nfruit-orchards surrounding homes of every grade of elegance, from the\r\nsimple vine-covered cottage to the costly villa with carefully-kept\r\nevergreen hedges enclosing exquisite lawns, statues, fountains and rare\r\nflowers. The extent of these hedges is estimated at seventy-five miles.\r\n\r\nBut this prosperous reclamation of the waste lands of South Jersey has\r\nalready received a check from an insidious but terrible enemy, destined\r\nto undo the labor of years unless promptly and wisely attacked. This\r\nenemy is drought, traceable directly to the destruction of the forests.\r\nFormerly, glass-manufacturing companies established themselves in\r\nwell-wooded regions, used the forests for their furnaces, and when these\r\nwere exhausted migrated to new places to repeat the work of devastation.\r\nThen the settlers \"cleared up\" the land extensively, and since the\r\nrailroads have been built the burning of the woods along their routes by\r\ncinders from the locomotives has been terribly frequent, and often\r\nextensive. A conductor on the Camden and Atlantic stated last year that\r\nhe had counted fifteen forest-fires during one trip from Camden to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nYet nothing is done to prevent these ever-recurring calamities. The\r\ncitizens complain, mourn over the destruction, grumble at the railroads,\r\nand thank God when the fires are at a safe distance from their own\r\nhomes. When personally threatened, they turn out, men, women and\r\nchildren, aided by terror-stricken and sympathizing neighbors, and\r\n\"fight the fire\" by felling trees and clearing away the inflammable\r\nmatter in the path of the fire. Sometimes a whole neighborhood will\r\nstruggle for days together without respite as only the desperate can.\r\nMany of these fires, it is said, are due to the wilful mischief of boys\r\nand others. Hundreds of acres are destroyed every year. Along the Camden\r\nand Atlantic almost every tract of woodland has been burned over once or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the decrease of the rainfall in South Jersey is already\r\nserious. The water-supply in Vineland, Hammonton and other places is\r\nconstantly lowering: all the wells except those that were dug very deep\r\nat first have had to be lowered at least two feet.\r\n\r\nThe most practical step at present toward arresting the destruction of\r\nwoodlands is no doubt the organization of forest-protecting and planting\r\nsocieties like those in Germany, which have now so far secured the aid\r\nof the legislative power that no landowner can cut down one of his own\r\nforest trees without the consent of the authorities. This seems like\r\ntyranny, but it is really that wisdom which recognizes the good of the\r\nwhole community as paramount to any private consideration.\r\n\r\n     M. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAFFAH COBBLESTONES.\r\n\r\n_Le Devoir_ gives some interesting information about the wonderful\r\nstones of Saffah, now on exhibition in the Asia Minor department of the\r\nMuseum of the Louvre. This department has lately been reopened to the\r\npublic, after being closed six months for internal improvements.\r\nVisitors pass before the cases containing these ordinary-looking\r\ncobblestones, and wonder why they should be there instead of in the\r\nstreet, where they seem to belong. But these ordinary-looking stones\r\nare, in the eyes of scholars, among the most precious objects of\r\nhistory: they are covered with writings in some unknown, and even\r\nunheard-of, tongue. Some of the writing is fine, some coarse: sometimes\r\nthe lines are straight, from right to left, and sometimes they wind\r\nabout, like the trail of a serpent, in every direction. Saffah is a\r\ndesert plain in Syria extending east from the lakes of Damascus, and a\r\npart of it is covered with these curious stones. Antiquaries like Renan,\r\nGanneau, De Vogue, Waddington and Pierret are sorely puzzled over the\r\nwriting on them, for the character resembles none that has yet been\r\ndeciphered. They will not, however, abandon the task, for antiquaries\r\nare Patience personified; and we shall one day know the history,\r\nlanguage, manners and customs of a race whose very existence up to the\r\npresent time has not even been suspected.\r\n\r\n     M. H.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] The published statistics of the Russian press are manifestly\r\nuntrustworthy; but the post-office returns of St. Petersburg show that\r\n82,000 copies of daily and 40,000 of weekly papers, with 50,000 copies\r\nof monthly periodicals, are yearly sent to the provinces. The largest\r\ncirculation (26,000) belongs to M. Katkoff's _Moscow Gazette_\r\n(_Moskovskiya Vedomosti_). Besides the native journals, 17 German\r\npapers, 5 French, 4 Polish, 2 Tartar and 1 Hebrew are published in\r\nRussia. Of English papers, the _Manchester Guardian_, thanks to the\r\nnumber of Lancashire workmen in the interior, has the widest\r\ncirculation: the _Times_ comes second, the _Illustrated London News_\r\nthird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic Islands as Resorts of Health and Pleasure. By S. G. W.\r\nBenjamin. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nInvalids and pleasure-seekers have here a guidebook to the summer and\r\nwinter resorts of the North Atlantic, from the desolate rocks called the\r\nMagdalen Islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the ever-bland Madeira\r\nand the over-bright Bahamas. The varied company of the isles embraces\r\neven Wight, where Cockney consumptives go to get out of the mist, and\r\nthe Norman group consecrated to cream and Victor Hugo. The author's good\r\ndescriptive powers are assisted by a number of drawings, many of which\r\nare finely done and well discriminate the local character of the\r\ndifferent places, latitudes and circumstances of life. He does not\r\nappear to be much of a valetudinarian himself, or he would hardly have\r\nbeen able to venture on and report for our benefit so wide a range of\r\ntravel and experience; but his preference obviously is for the island\r\nmost thoroughly tempered to the needs of an enfeebled constitution, and\r\nwhich welcomes most wooingly those whose first craving is to keep\r\nalive--Madeira. Such of us as associate their earliest recollections of\r\nthe name with the annual cask of wine will read with interest that\r\nthough the wine, thanks to the oidium or some malady of that sort, is a\r\nthing of the past, the spot retains many other charms ample to justify a\r\ntrip to its shores by a more roundabout way than the slow and direct or\r\ncostly and circuitous routes laid down by Mr. Benjamin. Teneriffe ranks\r\nclose to Madeira, and the Valley of Orotava, scooped out of the flank of\r\nthe famous peak, is recommended as simply perfection for sufferers from\r\n\"pulmonary complaints, rheumatism or neuralgia,\" and beneficial even in\r\nBright's disease. The thermometer in this happy valley stops at\r\nfifty-eight degrees in winter, and averages from sixty-eight to\r\nseventy-two degrees in summer. Should you find this temperature too\r\ninclement, you can descend to the port at its mouth and luxuriate in a\r\nrange of sixty-four to eighty degrees. Where we write the figure at this\r\nmoment is ninety degrees in the shade, and those semi-tropical outposts\r\nof the anciently-known world seem arctic.\r\n\r\nBermuda, New York's onion- and potato-garden, is presented to us in a\r\nless fascinating light, owing possibly, in part, to the fact that Mr. B.\r\ndoes not like onions, and was nearly stifled on his return by the odor\r\nof that nutritious esculent under battened hatchways. But he sees a\r\ngreat deal to delight sound travellers, and objects mainly in behalf of\r\nthe sick to the climate, which is only a modification of that of the\r\ncontinent, with an extra tempest or two thrown in. In protesting against\r\nthe antiquated mode of landing maintained by Bermudan conservatism, he\r\nthinks a more modern, rational and convenient plan would be hooted down\r\nby the wharf-mob in the spirit of \"Demetrius the coppersmith.\" We\r\nbelieve the Ephesian was a maker of silver images, though Alexander may\r\nhave been actuated by a like motive in opposing Paul's proceedings as\r\nnot good for trade.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of landing-places, that of Columbus is transferred, in a\r\nnotable note on the Bahamas, from Cat Island to Watling's Island. The\r\nformer has no lake, as the latter has; and Columbus insists on a lake.\r\nHe also went in one day with oars around the north end--a feat\r\nimpossible in one case and easy in the other. Watling, for this and\r\nother reasons dwelt on by English surveyors, is on the new maps\r\nrebaptized San Salvador, in rectification of euphony not less than of\r\nhistoric truth. If now equally successful inquiry could be brought to\r\nbear on the identity of the Discoverer's bones, claimed alike by Hayti\r\nand Cuba, it would be an additional comfort to the lovers of fact.\r\n\r\nSteam-service is steadily growing more frequent, regular and\r\nexpeditious, and the next generation of Americans will doubtless pack\r\ntheir portmanteaus as lightly for the Canaries, the Loffodens and the\r\nGalapagos as that now in being does for Appledore or Mount Desert. For\r\nindividual health, relaxation or enjoyment, not more than for the\r\ngeneral invigoration and well-being of the race, we need to be on easier\r\nterms with the sea. The old maritime spirit, so striking to the eyes of\r\nBurke, seems to have died out from among us. If we are to have a\r\nbrilliant and assured future, we must not look for it wholly to the\r\nland. It may not rise sheer, Britain- and Aphrodite-like, from the\r\nbreast of ocean, but it must yet rest partly upon that most solid of\r\nsupports, the ever-shifting wave.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Principles of Light and Color. By Edwin D. Babbitt. New York:\r\nBabbitt & Co.\r\n\r\nWere we to open this book about the middle we should be disposed to set\r\nit down, on the strength of its latter half, as a contribution to the\r\nliterature of the Pleasantonian (or blue-glass) school of natural\r\nphilosophy. This impression would be humored by the bluish tint of the\r\npaper upon which it is printed. But an inspection of the entire work\r\nwould show that it is something more comprehensive and ambitious, not to\r\nsay more interesting and suggestive. It is the product of a bold and\r\noriginal, if not exactly close and systematic, thinker--one who, with a\r\nlonger and severer experimental training in the fields he has chosen for\r\nexploration, would command the respectful attention of leading\r\nscientific men. He begins with the reflection that, \"in spite of the\r\nwonderful achievements of experimental scientists, no definite\r\nconceptions of atomic machinery, or the fundamental processes of\r\nthermal, electric, chemical, physiological or psychological action, have\r\nbeen attained.\" He proposes to remedy this failure, and to carry the\r\nnatural sciences to their \"basic principles.\" He proceeds to speculate\r\nwith great ingenuity on the nature of light, the form, relations and\r\nmovements of atoms, the action of electricity upon them, the\r\nconstitution of the atmosphere, mode of creation of the solar system,\r\nand the _rationale_ of chemical affinity. From these lofty regions he\r\nstoops to his conclusion in the new science of \"chromo-therapeutics.\" He\r\nundertakes to define and explain the alleged effects upon mind, soul and\r\nbody of all the colors of the spectrum. Among these colors he assigns\r\nthe place of honor to blue, that tint emanating from the frontal portion\r\nof the brain in rays visible to certain finely-organized individuals,\r\nand being associated with the highest intellectual faculties. Red\r\nbelongs to the opposite pole of the cerebral sphere, and holds special\r\nrelations with the grosser part of man's abstract nature. In this\r\nmysterious region of inquiry he joins hands with some questionable\r\nallies, such as the Spiritualists, the phrenologists and the\r\nmesmerizers. The power of the clairvoyants he does not doubt. Indeed, he\r\nclaims to have used it himself, and to have fattened on it, his present\r\nweight of one hundred and eighty pounds having been attained, he tells\r\nus, together with perfect health, by the judicious employment of \"these\r\nsubtler agencies.\" One is tempted to ask, in view of such a result, why\r\nwaste time on the color-cure when the mesmeric system succeeds so\r\nadmirably?\r\n\r\nShould we demur to these eccentricities of an enthusiastic savant, he\r\nwould perhaps point us to similar excesses in some of the acknowledged\r\nlights of intellectual progress, and cite as a recent instance of the\r\nmadness of too much learning the ascription, by the brilliant yet\r\nmatter-of-fact and practical Tyndall, of almighty \"potency\" to matter.\r\nOf course we should reply that Tyndall was a sincere and earnest\r\nstudent, and not a charlatan or a fanatic; whereto our author might\r\nrespond, and respond justly, in sharp disclaimer of the latter brace of\r\ncharacters. He seems to be sincere: he can read and think, and does\r\nboth, as the first part of his book, and much of the rest of it, show.\r\nHe would have escaped the imputation we have suggested as not unapt to\r\nbe cast upon him, secured a full hearing in a more respectable quarter,\r\nand gained higher aid in the development of his ideas, had he been less\r\nhasty in forming and stating some of his ultimate conclusions and the\r\npractical application of them. Many very able men who have preceded him\r\nin scientific labor, and who do not believe that \"the bowels will be\r\naroused into animation\" by the exhibition of \"a small strip of yellow\r\nglass three inches in depth, bordered by its affinitive violet,\" to the\r\numbilical region, or that \"Major Buckley developed one hundred and\r\nforty-eight persons so that they could read sentences shut up in boxes\r\nor nuts,\" would listen attentively to what he has to say on the anatomy\r\nof an atom, metachronism and \"chromatic attraction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAround the World in the Yacht Sunbeam. By Mrs. Brassey. New York: Henry\r\nHolt & Co.\r\n\r\nSome of the best books of travel we have had lately have been written by\r\nwomen. Their way of looking at new things, even if superficial--which is\r\nnot by any means always a safe assumption--is pleasant and refreshing\r\nafter the more sober, philosophic and blue-booky style of comment we are\r\naccustomed to be favored with by observers of the other sex. Many\r\nvaluable trivialities are lost by the effort to go deeper than the\r\nsurface. The phases of life, manners and scenery which strike one in a\r\nrapid tour are perhaps most instructive, and certainly most\r\nentertaining, when reproduced just as they appear. The light female\r\ntouch, which revolts at figures and documents, is well suited to that\r\nwork, if work it can be called. The male traveller, we know, does much\r\nof his research when he gets home, keeping up, however, with a view to\r\nthat end, a solemnly didactic frame of mind all the time he is abroad.\r\nHe is thus apt to give us less of what he sees than of what he\r\nthinks--an error into which a woman is less prone to fall. She is less\r\ncritical, less ashamed of being startled and pleased, and more frank and\r\nnaive in her confession of it. She resembles in this respect the\r\ndelightful voyagers of the Middle Ages--the Polos, Batutas and\r\nMandevilles--who were too much occupied with the novelty of everything\r\nthey saw to bore us with their opinions, and who were untrammelled by\r\nthe slightest idea of publishing a resume of political, religious or\r\neconomic conclusions when they got home. What an infinitesimal\r\nproportion of us understand even our own country! Why, then, obscure and\r\nflatten our impressions of foreign lands by supposing, and preparing to\r\nmake others believe, that we can understand them after a cursory study\r\nof a few weeks or months?\r\n\r\nMrs. Brassey is not a literary woman. She has no \"mission,\" and makes no\r\npretensions to culture. She simply chronicles a tour made in her\r\nhusband's yacht, accompanied by two or three young children and as many\r\nfriends. But she has good sense, good temper and character, and what she\r\nwrites fully justifies her husband's prefatory statement, that \"the\r\nvoyage would not have been undertaken, and assuredly it would never have\r\nbeen completed, without the impulse derived from her perseverance and\r\ndetermination.\" Unprepared by special study, and quite devoid of\r\nscience, she yet notes well, and interests us in, the animals, plants,\r\nhuman occupants and natural phenomena generally of the countries\r\nvisited. And without any command or affectation of imagery or fine\r\nlanguage she is very graphic in her descriptions of sea and shore. Her\r\naccount of a visit to the great Hawaian volcano is one of the best we\r\nhave ever read, being simple, terse and vivid, without the overloading\r\nwith detail that spoils so many of the pen-pictures of the day.\r\n\r\nThe trip was made in eleven months of 1876-77. The route lay from\r\nChatham to Madeira, Rio, the river Plate, Valparaiso (through the\r\nStraits of Magellan), the Society and Sandwich Islands, Yokohama,\r\nHong-Kong, Singapore, Ceylon, Aden, Alexandria, Malta, and so on back to\r\nEngland. It thus threaded a large part of the tropical world, and we are\r\nled to perceive a greater variety in tropical life and scenery than we\r\nare in the habit of realizing. The rapidity of movement facilitated\r\nthis, as it brought the different points more closely together, and made\r\nwhat there was of contrast more striking. Not that the movements of the\r\nparty were uniformly hurried either, for weeks were spent in Rio, the\r\nPampas, Chili and Japan, and sufficient stoppages made at many other\r\nplaces. The slow passage through the stormy Straits makes us acquainted\r\nwith the savages of the Land of Fire and their picturesque country,\r\ndecidedly more damp than fiery. Japan was reached in the season of ice\r\nand snow, and the author, wrapped in furs and ulsters, was puzzled by\r\nthe native contempt of the thermometer as shown in their wooden-walled\r\nhouses with paper partitions and the popular passion for the lightest\r\npossible raiment. We join in her amazement at the proceedings, on a\r\nfrosty morning, of the propellers of her _jenrishka_--or, as it is\r\npunningly termed, _pull-man-car_--who, compelled by law to wear their\r\nclothes in town, deliberately stopped when they struck the country and\r\ndivested themselves of almost the last stitch--a performance paralleled\r\nin the opposite hemisphere by a party of Fuegians, man, wife and son,\r\nwho came off in a canoe to trade, and stripped themselves utterly of\r\ntheir one garment of fine sea-otter skins in exchange for beads and\r\ntobacco. The author seems to have armed herself against surprises of\r\nthis and all other kinds, and to have set out prepared to accept\r\noutlandish ways as they came, and look on the bright and reasonable side\r\nof everything. She manifests no national prejudice, whether against\r\nsavage or civilized people, and commends frankly American carriages,\r\nrailways, tramways, calicoes and canned fruits wherever she meets them;\r\nand that is, for one or another item of the list, nearly everywhere.\r\nOur manufacturers will read with interest the compliments recorded as\r\npaid by their customers, actual and possible, in the Pacific and Indian\r\nOceans to the superior merit of their fabrics as compared with those of\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\nAltogether, should Mrs. Brassey's yacht be ready for another\r\ncircumnavigation before ours, we do not know that we should refuse the\r\noffer of a spare berth.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt-Education. A Lecture by General William Birney. Delivered February\r\n6, 1878, before the Washington Art-Club. Washington: Art-Club.\r\n\r\nThis brochure is mainly a sketch of the consequences to industrial art\r\nof the English Exhibition of 1851, or a consideration of the fruits of\r\nthe South Kensington Art-School. The humiliation of England in that\r\nExhibition is well known, and the way in which she profited by the\r\nbitter lesson is full of instruction to this country. Thoughtful\r\nAmericans, whether directly concerned in the welfare of laboring men or\r\nnot, remember uneasily the troubles of last year, listen with compassion\r\nto whatever sounds of distress come from the assemblies of those who\r\ncall themselves \"workingmen,\" and look with anxiety for evidence of\r\nreturning prosperity and contentment. All Americans worth mentioning are\r\nworkers and are in sympathy with labor. If any \"workingmen\" think that\r\nthere is a large or powerful class in this country opposed to the\r\ninterests of labor, they should at once dismiss the notion, and look\r\nfurther for the cause of their troubles. Considerate people see that the\r\n\"workingmen\" should take a wider view of their situation than most of\r\nthem seem to do; that they should look above and beyond the ranks of\r\npartisans for the light they need; that they should listen to those who\r\nwill discuss their problem with the coolness, the disinterestedness, the\r\nunhesitating honesty which characterize the leading scientists of the\r\nday in other fields of inquiry. Such are the speakers and writers they\r\nshould invite to their assistance. Instead of wasting their breath in\r\nexpressions of self-admiration, in threadbare platitudes about the\r\nnobility and rights of labor, in appeals to the omnipresent politician,\r\nin complaints against labor-saving machinery, in talk about the\r\nEight-Hour law, it would be more encouraging if they would try to\r\nsupplant foreign workmen by simply excelling them in workmanship, and\r\ntry to find employment by the creation of new industries. Higher\r\neducation in industrial art is the stepping-stone to this.\r\n\r\nAs the depression is the result of a combination of causes, it is not\r\nprobable that a panacea exists. Complete restoration will come from\r\nseveral remedies, each having its due effect in its own time and place.\r\nBut perhaps the most potent of all, one indispensable to thorough and\r\nlasting prosperity, is thus revealed by General Birney:\r\n\r\n\"Although the United States has not hitherto directed her attention to\r\nart, her manifest destiny is to do so. The necessity of events will\r\ncompel it. We have entered upon a long peace, in which we shall have to\r\ncompete with civilized nations for the supply of the markets of the\r\nworld. A population of forty millions cannot exist in comfort when they\r\nsell to the world nothing but agricultural implements, sewing-machines,\r\nrevolvers, clocks, corn, cheese and cheap cottons, and buy everything\r\nelse from it. The end of that course must be national ruin.\r\n\r\n\"For self-preservation, we must manufacture: we must have skilled labor.\r\nThe rapid increase of scientific knowledge makes art a necessity. As\r\nscience throws men out of employ, art must provide employment. The\r\nscientist and artist must walk hand in hand. The invention of\r\nlabor-saving machinery for the farmer, enabling one man to do the work\r\nwhich formerly required ten, is rapidly driving men from the country to\r\nthe cities. The invention of other machinery is rapidly throwing large\r\nnumbers of workmen out of employ. Political causes are adding to this\r\nevil. How to put the unemployed millions to work is the problem of the\r\nday. The salvation of the country depends upon its solution. The nation\r\nstands before each public man demanding that he shall read the riddle or\r\nbe destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"One of the helps to a solution, if not a solution, is the introduction\r\nof skilled labor. It takes but a few men to fashion a ton of iron into\r\nbars, but a thousand are not too many to work it into watch-springs.\r\nFive men can make all the coarse pottery used in this District: it takes\r\nfive hundred to make its decorated ware and porcelain. Rough hand-labor\r\nis being superseded by machinery. But the demand is greater than ever\r\nbefore for skilled labor, both to manage the machinery and to take the\r\nproduct where machinery has left it and fashion it into value by the\r\nart of the decorator. Such a workman plies his handiwork at his own\r\nhouse, teaching his sons the secrets of his trade. He is the necessary\r\ncoadjutor of the machine-owner, and has no need to resort to the brutal\r\nmethods of Molly Maguires and trades-unions to get a fair reward for his\r\nlabor. Let demagogues rant about our danger from competition with the\r\n_pauper_ labor of Europe! We never were, and never will be, injured by\r\nthat. What we should fear is the skilled labor of well-paid, cultured\r\nand educated artisans.\"\r\n\r\nThe French, who won so easy a victory over the English in 1851 in the\r\nmanufacture of whatever directly augments the luxury and elegance of\r\nlife, now fear that England will overcome France on her own ground. An\r\nable Parisian, criticising the Exhibition of 1878, and acknowledging the\r\nfacts it reveals, asks the French government to send, at the public\r\nexpense, a hundred workmen every year to Great Britain as a means of\r\nkeeping French artisans abreast of British and holding their own in the\r\nmarkets. Ours is not a paternal government. If it should send a hundred\r\nmen to England, half of them might be political bummers, whose chief\r\nstudy would be, not how to learn to work for the benefit of their\r\ncountrymen, but how to live without work. The American people are as\r\nindividuals supposed to take care of their own business. Do our\r\ntrades-unions and labor-clubs and workingmen's associations send a\r\nhundred picked men abroad every year for study and practice? Are they\r\ntoo conceited or ignorant to realize what most concerns them? Thousands\r\nof foreign subjects are earning money from us, while thousands of our\r\ncountrymen are suffering. This is not the fault of those foreign\r\nworkmen, nor of the American purchasers of their artistic work, nor of\r\nour government. It is in a great degree because Americans have not the\r\nskill and taste to take up material where machinery leaves it, and lay\r\nit down beautified by the touch of real art. An \"appeal to the\r\nballot-box,\" the sovereign remedy of a true American for every ill; the\r\nenactment that two and two shall make five, which is about what the\r\nEight-Hour law amounts to; the declaration by statute that so much of\r\none metal shall equal so much of another metal,--has there not been\r\nenough of this? Would not a few hundred well-educated emissaries of our\r\ntrades-unions and labor associations kept in the technical schools and\r\nworkshops abroad be of rather more value? \"How many of the graduates of\r\nthe South Kensington Art-School, and artisans whose ability is traceable\r\nto it, might have been induced to try here the fine work which now, in\r\nEngland, is making the French tremble for their laurels, by a judicious\r\nuse of the money which public halls, meetings, brass bands, processions,\r\ndelegations, disturbances, transparencies, lobbyists, blather-skites and\r\nstrikes have cost the 'workingmen' of America?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Republic: Its Services and Destiny.
