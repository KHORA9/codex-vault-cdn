J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, January 20th, 1867.\r\n\r\nProf. Miquel, of Utrecht, begs me to ask you for your carte, and offers\r\nhis in return. I grieve to bother you on such a subject. I am sick and\r\ntired of this carte correspondence. I cannot conceive what Humboldt's\r\nPyrenean violet is: no such is mentioned in Webb, and no alpine one at\r\nall. I am sorry I forgot to mention the stronger African affinity of\r\nthe eastern Canary Islands. Thank you for mentioning it. I cannot admit,\r\nwithout further analysis, that most of the peculiar Atlantic Islands\r\ngenera were derived from Europe, and have since become extinct there.\r\nI have rather thought that many are only altered forms of existing\r\nEuropean genera; but this is a very difficult point, and would require\r\na careful study of such genera and allies with this object in view. The\r\nsubject has often presented itself to me as a grand one for analytic\r\nbotany. No doubt its establishment would account for the community of\r\nthe peculiar genera on the several groups and islets, but whilst so\r\nmany species are common we must allow for a good deal of migration of\r\npeculiar genera too.\r\n\r\nBy Jove! I will write out next mail to the Governor of St. Helena for\r\nboxes of earth, and you shall have them to grow. Thanks for telling me\r\nof having suggested to me the working out of proportions of plants with\r\nirregular flowers in islands. I thought it was a deuced deal too good\r\nan idea to have arisen spontaneously in my block, though I did not\r\nrecollect your having done so. No doubt your suggestion was crystallised\r\nin some corner of my sensorium. I should like to work out the point.\r\n\r\nHave you Kerguelen Land amongst your volcanic islands? I have a curious\r\nbook of a sealer who was wrecked on the island, and who mentions a\r\nvolcanic mountain and hot springs at the S.W. end; it is called the\r\n\"Wreck of the Favourite.\" (378/1. \"Narrative of the Wreck of the\r\n'Favourite' on the Island of Desolation; detailing the Adventures,\r\nSufferings and Privations of John Munn; an Historical Account of the\r\nIsland and its Whale and Sea Fisheries.\" Edited by W.B. Clarke: London,\r\n1850.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 379. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 17th, 1867.\r\n\r\nIt is a long time since I have written, but I cannot boast that I have\r\nrefrained from charity towards you, but from having lots of work...You\r\nask what I have been doing. Nothing but blackening proofs with\r\ncorrections. I do not believe any man in England naturally writes so\r\nvile a style as I do...\r\n\r\nIn your paper on \"Insular Floras\" (page 9) there is what I must think an\r\nerror, which I before pointed out to you: viz., you say that the plants\r\nwhich are wholly distinct from those of nearest continent are often\r\nvery common instead of very rare. (379/1. \"Insular Floras,\" pamphlet\r\nreprinted from the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" page 9: \"As a general\r\nrule the species of the mother continent are proportionally the most\r\nabundant, and cover the greatest surface of the islands. The peculiar\r\nspecies are rarer, the peculiar genera of continental affinity are rarer\r\nstill; whilst the plants having no affinity with those of the mother\r\ncontinent are often very common.\" In a letter of March 20th, 1867,\r\nSir Joseph explains that in the case of the Atlantic islands it is the\r\n\"peculiar genera of EUROPEAN AFFINITY that are so rare,\" while Clethra,\r\nDracaena and the Laurels, which have no European affinity, are common.)\r\nEtty (379/2. Mr. Darwin's daughter, now Mrs. Litchfield.), who has read\r\nyour paper with great interest, was confounded by this sentence. By the\r\nway, I have stumbled on two old notes: one, that twenty-two species of\r\nEuropean birds occasionally arrive as chance wanderers to the Azores;\r\nand, secondly, that trunks of American trees have been known to be\r\nwashed on the shores of the Canary Islands by the Gulf-stream, which\r\nreturns southward from the Azores. What poor papers those of A. Murray\r\nare in \"Gardeners' Chronicle.\" What conclusions he draws from a single\r\nCarabus (379/3. \"Dr. Hooker on Insular Floras\" (\"Gardeners' Chronicle,\"\r\n1867, pages 152, 181). The reference to the Carabidous beetle\r\n(Aplothorax) is at page 181.), and that a widely ranging genus! He seems\r\nto me conceited; you and I are fair game geologically, but he refers to\r\nLyell, as if his opinion on a geological point was worth no more than\r\nhis own. I have just bought, but not read a sentence of, Murray's\r\nbig book (379/4. \"Geographical Distribution of Mammals,\" 1866.),\r\nsecond-hand, for 30s., new, so I do not envy the publishers. It is clear\r\nto me that the man cannot reason. I have had a very nice letter from\r\nScott at Calcutta (379/5. See Letter 150.): he has been making some\r\ngood observations on the acclimatisation of seeds from plants of same\r\nspecies, grown in different countries, and likewise on how far European\r\nplants will stand the climate of Calcutta. He says he is astonished\r\nhow well some flourish, and he maintains, if the land were unoccupied,\r\nseveral could easily cross, spreading by seed, the Tropics from north to\r\nsouth, so he knows how to please me; but I have told him to be cautious,\r\nelse he will have dragons down on him...\r\n\r\nAs the Azores are only about two-and-a-half times more distant from\r\nAmerica (in the same latitude) than from Europe, on the occasional\r\nmigration view (especially as oceanic currents come directly from\r\nWest Indies and Florida, and heavy gales of wind blow from the same\r\ndirection), a large percentage of the flora ought to be American; as it\r\nis, we have only the Sanicula, and at present we have no explanation of\r\nthis apparent anomaly, or only a feeble indication of an explanation in\r\nthe birds of the Azores being all European.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 380. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 21st [1867].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your pleasant and very amusing letter. You have been\r\ntreated shamefully by Etty and me, but now that I know the facts,\r\nthe sentence seems to me quite clear. Nevertheless, as we have both\r\nblundered, it would be well to modify the sentence something as follows:\r\n\"whilst, on the other hand, the plants which are related to those\r\nof distant continents, but have no affinity with those of the mother\r\ncontinent, are often very common.\" I forget whether you explain this\r\ncircumstance, but it seems to me very mysterious (380/1. Sir Joseph\r\nHooker wrote (March 23rd, 1867): \"I see you 'smell a rat' in the matter\r\nof insular plants that are related to those of [a] distant continent\r\nbeing common. Yes, my beloved friend, let me make a clean breast of\r\nit. I only found it out after the lecture was in print!...I have\r\nbeen waiting ever since to 'think it out,' and write to you about it,\r\ncoherently. I thought it best to squeeze it in, anyhow or anywhere,\r\nrather than leave so curious a fact unnoticed.\")...Do always remember\r\nthat nothing in the world gives us so much pleasure as seeing you here\r\nwhenever you can come. I chuckle over what you say of And. Murray, but I\r\nmust grapple with his book some day.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 381. TO C. LYELL. Down, October 31st [1867].\r\n\r\nMr. [J.P. Mansel] Weale sent to me from Natal a small packet of dry\r\nlocust dung, under 1/2 oz., with the statement that it is believed that\r\nthey introduce new plants into a district. (381/1. See Volume I., Letter\r\n221.) This statement, however, must be very doubtful. From this packet\r\nseven plants have germinated, belonging to at least two kinds of\r\ngrasses. There is no error, for I dissected some of the seeds out of\r\nthe middle of the pellets. It deserves notice that locusts are sometimes\r\nblown far out to sea. I caught one 370 miles from Africa, and I have\r\nheard of much greater distances. You might like to hear the following\r\ncase, as it relates to a migratory bird belonging to the most wandering\r\nof all orders--viz. the woodcock. (381/2. \"Origin,\" Edition VI., page\r\n328.) The tarsus was firmly coated with mud, weighing when dry 9 grains,\r\nand from this the Juncus bufonius, or toad rush, germinated. By the way,\r\nthe locust case verifies what I said in the \"Origin,\" that many possible\r\nmeans of distribution would be hereafter discovered. I quite agree about\r\nthe extreme difficulty of the distribution of land mollusca. You will\r\nhave seen in the last edition of \"Origin\" (381/3. \"Origin,\" Edition IV.,\r\npage 429. The reference is to MM. Marten's (381/4. For Marten's read\r\nMartins' [the name is wrongly spelt in the \"Origin of Species.\"])\r\nexperiments on seeds \"in a box in the actual sea.\") that my observations\r\non the effects of sea-water have been confirmed. I still suspect that\r\nthe legs of birds which roost on the ground may be an efficient means;\r\nbut I was interrupted when going to make trials on this subject, and\r\nhave never resumed it.\r\n\r\nWe shall be in London in the middle of latter part of November, when I\r\nshall much enjoy seeing you. Emma sends her love, and many thanks for\r\nLady Lyell's note.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 382. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Wednesday [1867].\r\n\r\nI daresay there is a great deal of truth in your remarks on the glacial\r\naffair, but we are in a muddle, and shall never agree. I am bigoted to\r\nthe last inch, and will not yield. I cannot think how you can attach so\r\nmuch weight to the physicists, seeing how Hopkins, Hennessey, Haughton,\r\nand Thomson have enormously disagreed about the rate of cooling of the\r\ncrust; remembering Herschel's speculations about cold space (382/1.\r\nThe reader will find some account of Herschel's views in Lyell's\r\n\"Principles,\" 1872, Edition XI., Volume I., page 283.), and bearing in\r\nmind all the recent speculations on change of axis, I will maintain to\r\nthe death that your case of Fernando Po and Abyssinia is worth ten\r\ntimes more than the belief of a dozen physicists. (382/2. See \"Origin,\"\r\nEdition VI., page 337: \"Dr. Hooker has also lately shown that several of\r\nthe plants living on the upper parts of the lofty island of Fernando Po\r\nand on the neighbouring Cameroon mountains, in the Gulf of Guinea, are\r\nclosely related to those in the mountains of Abyssinia, and likewise to\r\nthose of temperate Europe.\" Darwin evidently means that such facts as\r\nthese are better evidence of the gigantic periods of time occupied by\r\nevolutionary changes than the discordant conclusions of the physicists.\r\nSee \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" Volume VII., page 180, for Hooker's general\r\nconclusions; also Hooker and Ball's \"Marocco,\" Appendix F, page 421. For\r\nthe case of Fernando Po see Hooker (\"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" VI., 1861, page\r\n3, where he sums up: \"Hence the result of comparing Clarence Peak flora\r\n[Fernando Po] with that of the African continent is--(1) the intimate\r\nrelationship with Abyssinia, of whose flora it is a member, and from\r\nwhich it is separated by 1800 miles of absolutely unexplored country;\r\n(2) the curious relationship with the East African islands, which are\r\nstill farther off; (3) the almost total dissimilarity from the Cape\r\nflora.\" For Sir J.D. Hooker's general conclusions on the Cameroon plants\r\nsee \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" VII., page 180. More recently equally striking\r\ncases have come to light: for instance, the existence of a Mediterranean\r\ngenus, Adenocarpus, in the Cameroons and on Kilima Njaro, and nowhere\r\nelse in Africa; and the probable migration of South African forms along\r\nthe highlands from the Natal District to Abysinnia. See Hooker, \"Linn.\r\nSoc. Journ.\" XIV., 1874, pages 144-5.) Your remarks on my regarding\r\ntemperate plants and disregarding the tropical plants made me at first\r\nuncomfortable, but I soon recovered. You say that all botanists would\r\nagree that many tropical plants could not withstand a somewhat cooler\r\nclimate. But I have come not to care at all for general beliefs without\r\nthe special facts. I have suffered too often from this: thus I found in\r\nevery book the general statement that a host of flowers were fertilised\r\nin the bud, that seeds could not withstand salt water, etc., etc. I\r\nwould far more trust such graphic accounts as that by you of the mixed\r\nvegetation on the Himalayas and other such accounts. And with respect to\r\ntropical plants withstanding the slowly coming on cool period, I trust\r\nto such facts as yours (and others) about seeds of the same species\r\nfrom mountains and plains having acquired a slightly different climatal\r\nconstitution. I know all that I have said will excite in you savage\r\ncontempt towards me. Do not answer this rigmarole, but attack me to your\r\nheart's content, and to that of mine, whenever you can come here, and\r\nmay it be soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 383. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, 1870.\r\n\r\n(383/1. The following extract from a letter of Sir J.D. Hooker shows the\r\ntables reversed between the correspondents.)\r\n\r\nGrove is disgusted at your being disquieted about W. Thomson. Tell\r\nGeorge from me not to sit upon you with his mathematics. When I\r\nthreatened your tropical cooling views with the facts of the physicists,\r\nyou snubbed me and the facts sweetly, over and over again; and now,\r\nbecause a scarecrow of x+y has been raised on the selfsame facts, you\r\nboo-boo. Take another dose of Huxley's penultimate G. S. Address, and\r\nsend George back to college. (383/2. Huxley's Anniversary Address to the\r\nGeological Society, 1869 (\"Collected Essays,\" VIII., page 305). This is\r\na criticism of Lord Kelvin's paper \"On Geological Time\" (\"Trans. Geolog.\r\nSoc. Glasgow,\" III.). At page 336 Mr. Huxley deals with Lord Kelvin's\r\n\"third line of argument, based on the temperature of the interior of the\r\nearth.\" This was no doubt the point most disturbing to Mr. Darwin, since\r\nit led Lord Kelvin to ask (as quoted by Huxley), \"Are modern geologists\r\nprepared to say that all life was killed off the earth 50,000, 100,000,\r\nor 200,000 years ago?\" Mr. Huxley, after criticising Lord Kelvin's data\r\nand conclusion, gives his conviction that the case against Geology has\r\nbroken down. With regard to evolution, Huxley (page 328) ingeniously\r\npoints out a case of circular reasoning. \"But it may be said that it\r\nis biology, and not geology, which asks for so much time--that the\r\nsuccession of life demands vast intervals; but this appears to me to\r\nbe reasoning in a circle. Biology takes her time from geology. The only\r\nreason we have for believing in the slow rate of the change in living\r\nforms is the fact that they persist through a series of deposits which,\r\ngeology informs us, have taken a long while to make. If the geological\r\nclock is wrong, all the naturalist will have to do is to modify his\r\nnotions of the rapidity of change accordingly.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 384. TO J.D. HOOKER. February 3rd [1868].\r\n\r\nI am now reading Miquel on \"Flora of Japan\" (384/1. Miquel, \"Flore du\r\nJapon\": \"Archives Neerlandaises\" ii., 1867.), and like it: it is rather\r\na relief to me (though, of course, not new to you) to find so very\r\nmuch in common with Asia. I wonder if A. Murray's (384/2. \"Geographical\r\nDistribution of Mammals,\" by Andrew Murray, 1866. See Chapter V., page\r\n47. See Letter 379.) notion can be correct, that a [profound] arm of\r\nthe sea penetrated the west coast of N. America, and prevented the\r\nAsiatico-Japan element colonising that side of the continent so much\r\nas the eastern side; or will climate suffice? I shall to the day of my\r\ndeath keep up my full interest in Geographical Distribution, but I doubt\r\nwhether I shall ever have strength to come in any fuller detail than in\r\nthe \"Origin\" to this grand subject. In fact, I do not suppose any man\r\ncould master so comprehensive a subject as it now has become, if all\r\nkingdoms of nature are included. I have read Murray's book, and am\r\ndisappointed--though, as you said, here and there clever thoughts occur.\r\nHow strange it is, that his view not affording the least explanation of\r\nthe innumerable adaptations everywhere to be seen apparently does not\r\nin the least trouble his mind. One of the most curious cases which he\r\nadduces seems to me to be the two allied fresh-water, highly peculiar\r\nporpoises in the Ganges and Indus; and the more distantly allied form\r\nof the Amazons. Do you remember his explanation of an arm of the sea\r\nbecoming cut off, like the Caspian, converted into fresh-water, and then\r\ndivided into two lakes (by upheaval), giving rise to two great rivers.\r\nBut no light is thus thrown on the affinity of the Amazon form. I now\r\nfind from Flower's paper (384/3. \"Zoolog. Trans.\" VI., 1869, page 115.\r\nThe toothed whales are divided into the Physeteridae, the Delphinidae,\r\nand the Platanistidae, which latter is placed between the two\r\nother families, and is divided into the sub-families Iniinae and\r\nPlatanistinae.) that these fresh-water porpoises form two sub-families,\r\nmaking an extremely isolated and intermediate, very small family. Hence\r\nto us they are clearly remnants of a large group; and I cannot doubt\r\nwe here have a good instance precisely like that of ganoid fishes, of a\r\nlarge ancient marine group, preserved exclusively in fresh-water, where\r\nthere has been less competition, and consequently little modification.\r\n(384/4. See Volume I., Letter 95.) What a grand fact that is which\r\nMiquel gives of the beech not extending beyond the Caucasus, and then\r\nreappearing in Japan, like your Himalayan Pinus, and the cedar of\r\nLebanon. (384/5. For Pinus read Deodar. The essential identity of the\r\ndeodar and the cedar of Lebanon was pointed out in Hooker's \"Himalayan\r\nJournals\" in 1854 (Volume I., page 257.n). In the \"Nat. History Review,\"\r\nJanuary, 1862, the question is more fully dealt with by him, and the\r\ndistribution discussed. The nearest point at which cedars occur is the\r\nBulgar-dagh chain of Taurus--250 miles from Lebanon. Under the name of\r\nCedrus atlantica the tree occurs in mass on the borders of Tunis, and as\r\nDeodar it first appears to the east in the cedar forests of Afghanistan.\r\nSir J.D. Hooker supposes that, during a period of greater cold, the\r\ncedars on the Taurus and on Lebanon lived many thousand feet nearer the\r\nsea-level, and spread much farther to the east, meeting similar belts\r\nof trees descending and spreading westward from Afghanistan along the\r\nPersian mountains.) I know of nothing that gives one such an idea of the\r\nrecent mutations in the surface of the land as these living \"outlyers.\"\r\nIn the geological sense we must, I suppose, admit that every yard of\r\nland has been successively covered with a beech forest between the\r\nCaucasus and Japan!\r\n\r\nI have not yet seen (for I have not sent to the station) Falconer's\r\nworks. When you say that you sigh to think how poor your reprinted\r\nmemoirs would appear, on my soul I should like to shake you till your\r\nbones rattled for talking such nonsense. Do you sigh over the \"Insular\r\nFloras,\" the Introduction to New Zealand Flora, to Australia, your\r\nArctic Flora, and dear Galapagos, etc., etc., etc.? In imagination I am\r\ngrinding my teeth and choking you till I put sense into you. Farewell. I\r\nhave amused myself by writing an audaciously long letter. By the way, we\r\nheard yesterday that George has won the second Smith's Prize, which I am\r\nexcessively glad of, as the Second Wrangler by no means always succeeds.\r\nThe examination consists exclusively of [the] most difficult subjects,\r\nwhich such men as Stokes, Cayley, and Adams can set.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 385. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. March 8th, 1868.\r\n\r\n...While writing a few pages on the northern alpine forms of plants\r\non the Java mountains I wanted a few cases to refer to like Teneriffe,\r\nwhere there are no northern forms and scarcely any alpine. I expected\r\nthe volcanoes of Hawaii would be a good case, and asked Dr. Seemann\r\nabout them. It seems a man has lately published a list of Hawaiian\r\nplants, and the mountains swarm with European alpine genera and\r\nsome species! (385/1. \"This turns out to be inaccurate, or greatly\r\nexaggerated. There are no true alpines, and the European genera are\r\ncomparatively few. See my 'Island Life,' page 323.\"--A.R.W.) Is not this\r\nmost extraordinary, and a puzzler? They are, I believe, truly oceanic\r\nislands, in the absence of mammals and the extreme poverty of birds and\r\ninsects, and they are within the Tropics.\r\n\r\nWill not that be a hard nut for you when you come to treat in detail on\r\ngeographical distribution? I enclose Seemann's note, which please return\r\nwhen you have copied the list, if of any use to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 386. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 21st [1870].\r\n\r\nI read yesterday the notes on Round Island (386/1. In Wallace's \"Island\r\nLife,\" page 410, Round Island is described as an islet \"only about a\r\nmile across, and situated about fourteen miles north-east of Mauritius.\"\r\nWallace mentions a snake, a python belonging to the peculiar and\r\ndistinct genus Casarea, as found on Round Island, and nowhere else in\r\nthe world. The palm Latania Loddigesii is quoted by Wallace as \"confined\r\nto Round Island and two other adjacent islets.\" See Baker's \"Flora of\r\nthe Mauritius and the Seychelles.\" Mr. Wallace says that, judging from\r\nthe soundings, Round Island was connected with Mauritius, and that when\r\nit was \"first separated [it] would have been both much larger and much\r\nnearer the main island.\") which I owe to you. Was there ever such an\r\nenigma? If, in the course of a week or two, you can find time to let me\r\nhear what you think, I should very much like to hear: or we hope to be\r\nat Erasmus' on March 4th for a week. Would there be any chance of your\r\ncoming to luncheon then? What a case it is. Palms, screw-pines, four\r\nsnakes--not one being in main island--lizards, insects, and not one\r\nland bird. But, above everything, such a proportion of individual\r\nmonocotyledons! The conditions do not seem very different from the Tuff\r\nGalapagos Island, but, as far as I remember, very few monocotyledons\r\nthere. Then, again, the island seems to have been elevated. I wonder\r\nmuch whether it stands out in the line of any oceanic current, which\r\ndoes not so forcibly strike the main island? But why, oh, why should so\r\nmany monocotyledons have come there? or why should they have survived\r\nthere more than on the main island, if once connected? So, again, I\r\ncannot conceive that four snakes should have become extinct in Mauritius\r\nand survived on Round Island. For a moment I thought that Mauritius\r\nmight be the newer island, but the enormous degradation which the outer\r\nring of rocks has undergone flatly contradicts this, and the marine\r\nremains on the summit of Round Island indicate the island to be\r\ncomparatively new--unless, indeed, they are fossil and extinct marine\r\nremains. Do tell me what you think. There never was such an enigma.\r\nI rather lean to separate immigration, with, of course, subsequent\r\nmodification; some forms, of course, also coming from Mauritius.\r\nSpeaking of Mauritius reminds me that I was so much pleased the day\r\nbefore yesterday by reading a review of a book on the geology of St.\r\nHelena, by an officer who knew nothing of my hurried observations, but\r\nconfirms nearly all that I have said on the general structure of the\r\nisland, and on its marvellous denudation. The geology of that island was\r\nlike a novel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 387. TO A. BLYTT. Down, March 28th, 1876.\r\n\r\n(387/1. The following refers to Blytt's \"Essay on the Immigration of the\r\nNorwegian Flora during Alternating Rainy and Dry Periods,\" Christiania,\r\n1876.)\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your kindness in having sent me your work on\r\nthe \"Immigration of the Norwegian Flora,\" which has interested me in the\r\nhighest degree. Your view, supported as it is by various facts, appears\r\nto me the most important contribution towards understanding the present\r\ndistribution of plants, which has appeared since Forbes' essay on the\r\neffects of the Glacial Period.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 388. TO AUG. FOREL. Down, June 19th, 1876.\r\n\r\nI hope you will allow me to suggest an observation, should any\r\nopportunity occur, on a point which has interested me for many\r\nyears--viz., how do the coleoptera which inhabit the nests of ants\r\ncolonise a new nest? Mr. Wallace, in reference to the presence of such\r\ncoleoptera in Madeira, suggests that their ova may be attached to the\r\nwinged female ants, and that these are occasionally blown across the\r\nocean to the island. It would be very interesting to discover whether\r\nthe ova are adhesive, and whether the female coleoptera are guided by\r\ninstinct to attach them to the female ants (388/1. Dr. Sharp is good\r\nenough to tell us that he is not aware of any such adaptation. Broadly\r\nspeaking, the distribution of the nest-inhabiting beetles is due to\r\nco-migration with the ants, though in some cases the ants transport the\r\nbeetles. Sitaris and Meloe are beetles which live \"at the expense of\r\nbees of the genus Anthophora.\" The eggs are laid not in but near the\r\nbees' nest; in the early stage the larva is active and has the instinct\r\nto seize any hairy object near it, and in this way they are carried by\r\nthe Anthophora to the nest. Dr. Sharp states that no such preliminary\r\nstage is known in the ant's-nest beetles. For an account of Sitaris and\r\nMeloe, see Sharp's \"Insects,\" II., page 272.); or whether the larvae\r\npass through an early stage, as with Sitaris or Meloe, or cling to the\r\nbodies of the females. This note obviously requires no answer. I trust\r\nthat you continue your most interesting investigations on ants.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: MR. A.R. WALLACE, 1878. From a photograph by Maull & Fox.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 389. TO A.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n(389/1. Published in \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 230.)\r\n\r\n(389/2. The following five letters refer to Mr. Wallace's \"Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals,\" 1876.)\r\n\r\n[Hopedene] (389/3. Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood's house in Surrey.), June 5th,\r\n1876.\r\n\r\nI must have the pleasure of expressing to you my unbounded admiration\r\nof your book (389/4. \"Geographical Distribution,\" 1876.), though I have\r\nread only to page 184--my object having been to do as little as\r\npossible while resting. I feel sure that you have laid a broad and safe\r\nfoundation for all future work on Distribution. How interesting it will\r\nbe to see hereafter plants treated in strict relation to your views; and\r\nthen all insects, pulmonate molluscs and fresh-water fishes, in greater\r\ndetail than I suppose you have given to these lower animals. The point\r\nwhich has interested me most, but I do not say the most valuable point,\r\nis your protest against sinking imaginary continents in a quite\r\nreckless manner, as was stated by Forbes, followed, alas, by Hooker,\r\nand caricatured by Wollaston and [Andrew] Murray! By the way, the main\r\nimpression that the latter author has left on my mind is his utter want\r\nof all scientific judgment. I have lifted up my voice against the above\r\nview with no avail, but I have no doubt that you will succeed, owing\r\nto your new arguments and the coloured chart. Of a special value, as it\r\nseems to me, is the conclusion that we must determine the areas, chiefly\r\nby the nature of the mammals. When I worked many years ago on this\r\nsubject, I doubted much whether the now-called Palaearctic and Nearctic\r\nregions ought to be separated; and I determined if I made another region\r\nthat it should be Madagascar. I have, therefore, been able to appreciate\r\nyour evidence on these points. What progress Palaeontology has made\r\nduring the last twenty years! but if it advances at the same rate in the\r\nfuture, our views on the migration and birthplace of the various groups\r\nwill, I fear, be greatly altered. I cannot feel quite easy about the\r\nGlacial period, and the extinction of large mammals, but I must hope\r\nthat you are right. I think you will have to modify your belief about\r\nthe difficulty of dispersal of land molluscs; I was interrupted when\r\nbeginning to experimentise on the just hatched young adhering to the\r\nfeet of ground-roosting birds. I differ on one other point--viz. in the\r\nbelief that there must have existed a Tertiary Antarctic continent, from\r\nwhich various forms radiated to the southern extremities of our present\r\ncontinents. But I could go on scribbling forever. You have written, as\r\nI believe, a grand and memorable work, which will last for years as the\r\nfoundation for all future treatises on Geographical Distribution.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You have paid me the highest conceivable compliment, by what\r\nyou say of your work in relation to my chapters on distribution in the\r\n\"Origin,\" and I heartily thank you for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 390. FROM A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. The Dell, Grays, Essex,\r\nJune 7th, 1876.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your very kind letter. So few people will read my book\r\nat all regularly, that a criticism from one who does so will be very\r\nwelcome. If, as I suppose, it is only to page 184 of Volume I. that you\r\nhave read, you cannot yet quite see my conclusions on the points you\r\nrefer to (land molluscs and Antarctic continent). My own conclusion\r\nfluctuated during the progress of the book, and I have, I know,\r\noccasionally used expressions (the relics of earlier ideas) which are\r\nnot quite consistent with what I say further on. I am positively against\r\nany Southern continent as uniting South America with Australia or New\r\nZealand, as you will see at Volume I., pages 398-403, and 459-66. My\r\ngeneral conclusions as to distribution of land mollusca are at Volume\r\nII., pages 522-9. (390/1. \"Geographical Distribution\" II., pages 524,\r\n525. Mr. Wallace points out that \"hardly a small island on the globe but\r\nhas some land-shells peculiar to it\"--and he goes so far as to say that\r\nprobably air-breathing mollusca have been chiefly distributed by air-\r\nor water-carriage, rather than by voluntary dispersal on the land.) When\r\nyou have read these passages, and looked at the general facts which lead\r\nto them, I shall be glad to hear if you still differ from me.\r\n\r\nThough, of course, present results as to the origin and migrations of\r\ngenera of mammals will have to be modified owing to new discoveries, I\r\ncannot help thinking that much will remain unaffected, because in all\r\ngeographical and geological discoveries the great outlines are soon\r\nreached, the details alone remain to be modified. I also think much of\r\nthe geological evidence is now so accordant with, and explanatory of,\r\nGeographical Distribution, that it is prima facie correct in outline.\r\nNevertheless, such vast masses of new facts will come out in the next\r\nfew years that I quite dread the labour of incorporating them in a new\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nI hope your health is improved; and when, quite at your leisure, you\r\nhave waded through my book, I trust you will again let me have a few\r\nlines of friendly criticism and advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 391. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, June 17th, 1876.\r\n\r\nI have now finished the whole of Volume I., with the same interest and\r\nadmiration as before; and I am convinced that my judgment was right\r\nand that it is a memorable book, the basis of all future work on the\r\nsubject. I have nothing particular to say, but perhaps you would like to\r\nhear my impressions on two or three points. Nothing has struck me more\r\nthan the admirable and convincing manner in which you treat Java. To\r\nallude to a very trifling point, it is capital about the unadorned head\r\nof the Argus-pheasant. (391/1. See \"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., pages\r\n90 and 143, for drawings of the Argus pheasant and its markings. The\r\nocelli on the wing feathers were favourite objects of Mr. Darwin,\r\nand sometimes formed the subject of the little lectures which on rare\r\noccasions he would give to a visitor interested in Natural History. In\r\nMr. Wallace's book the meaning of the ocelli comes in by the way, in the\r\nexplanation of Plate IX., \"A Malayan Forest with some of its peculiar\r\nBirds.\" Mr. Wallace (volume i., page 340) points out that the head of\r\nthe Argus pheasant is, during the display of the wings, concealed from\r\nthe view of a spectator in front, and this accounts for the absence of\r\nbright colour on the head--a most unusual point in a pheasant. The case\r\nis described as a \"remarkable confirmation of Mr. Darwin's views, that\r\ngaily coloured plumes are developed in the male bird for the purpose\r\nof attractive display.\" For the difference of opinion between the two\r\nnaturalists on the broad question of coloration see \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nIII., page 123. See Letters 440-453.) How plain a thing is, when it is\r\nonce pointed out! What a wonderful case is that of Celebes: I am glad\r\nthat you have slightly modified your views with respect to Africa.\r\n(391/2. \"I think this must refer to the following passage in 'Geog.\r\nDist. of Animals,' Volume I., pages 286-7. 'At this period (Miocene)\r\nMadagascar was no doubt united with Africa, and helped to form a great\r\nsouthern continent which must at one time have extended eastward as far\r\nas Southern India and Ceylon; and over the whole of this the lemurine\r\ntype no doubt prevailed.' At the time this was written I had not paid\r\nso much attention to islands, and in my \"Island Life\" I have given ample\r\nreasons for my belief that the evidence of extinct animals does not\r\nrequire any direct connection between Southern India and Africa.\"--Note\r\nby Mr. Wallace.) And this leads me to say that I cannot swallow the\r\nso-called continent of Lemuria--i.e., the direct connection of Africa\r\nand Ceylon. (391/3. See \"Geographical Distribution,\" I., page 76. The\r\nname Lemuria was proposed by Mr. Sclater for an imaginary submerged\r\ncontinent extending from Madagascar to Ceylon and Sumatra. Mr. Wallace\r\npoints out that if we confine ourselves to facts Lemuria is reduced to\r\nMadagascar, which he makes a subdivision of the Ethiopian Region.) The\r\nfacts do not seem to me many and strong enough to justify so immense a\r\nchange of level. Moreover, Mauritius and the other islands appear to\r\nme oceanic in character. But do not suppose that I place my judgment\r\non this subject on a level with yours. A wonderfully good paper was\r\npublished about a year ago on India, in the \"Geological Journal,\" I\r\nthink by Blanford. (391/4. H.F. Blanford \"On the Age and Correlations\r\nof the Plant-bearing Series of India and the Former Existence of an\r\nIndo-Oceanic Continent\" (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" XXXI., 1875, page\r\n519). The name Gondwana-Land was subsequently suggested by Professor\r\nSuess for this Indo-Oceanic continent. Since the publication of\r\nBlanford's paper, much literature has appeared dealing with the evidence\r\nfurnished by fossil plants, etc., in favour of the existence of a vast\r\nsouthern continent.) Ramsay agreed with me that it was one of the\r\nbest published for a long time. The author shows that India has been a\r\ncontinent with enormous fresh-water lakes, from the Permian period to\r\nthe present day. If I remember right, he believes in a former connection\r\nwith S. Africa.\r\n\r\nI am sure that I read, some twenty to thirty years ago in a French\r\njournal, an account of teeth of Mastodon found in Timor; but the\r\nstatement may have been an error. (391/5. In a letter to Falconer\r\n(Letter 155), January 5th, 1863, Darwin refers to the supposed\r\noccurrence of Mastodon as having been \"smashed\" by Falconer.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to what you say about the colonising of New Zealand,\r\nI somewhere have an account of a frog frozen in the ice of a Swiss\r\nglacier, and which revived when thawed. I may add that there is an\r\nIndian toad which can resist salt-water and haunts the seaside. Nothing\r\never astonished me more than the case of the Galaxias; but it does\r\nnot seem known whether it may not be a migratory fish like the salmon.\r\n(391/6. The only genus of the Galaxidae, a family of fresh-water fishes\r\noccurring in New Zealand, Tasmania, and Tierra del Fuego, ranging north\r\nas far as Queensland and Chile (Wallace's \"Geographical Distribution,\"\r\nII., page 448).)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 392. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, June 25th, 1876.\r\n\r\nI have been able to read rather more quickly of late, and have finished\r\nyour book. I have not much to say. Your careful account of the temperate\r\nparts of South America interested me much, and all the more from knowing\r\nsomething of the country. I like also much the general remarks towards\r\nthe end of the volume on the land molluscs. Now for a few criticisms.\r\n\r\nPage 122. (392/1. The pages refer to Volume II. of Wallace's\r\n\"Geographical Distribution.\")--I am surprised at your saying that\r\n\"during the whole Tertiary period North America was zoologically far\r\nmore strongly contrasted with South America than it is now.\" But we know\r\nhardly anything of the latter except during the Pliocene period; and\r\nthen the mastodon, horse, several great edentata, etc., etc., were\r\ncommon to the north and south. If you are right, I erred greatly in my\r\n\"Journal,\" where I insisted on the former close connection between the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nPage 252 and elsewhere.--I agree thoroughly with the general principle\r\nthat a great area with many competing forms is necessary for much and\r\nhigh development; but do you not extend this principle too far--I should\r\nsay much too far, considering how often several species of the same\r\ngenus have been developed on very small islands?\r\n\r\nPage 265.--You say that the Sittidae extend to Madagascar, but there\r\nis no number in the tabular heading. [The number (4) was erroneously\r\nomitted.--A.R.W.]\r\n\r\nPage 359.--Rhinochetus is entered in the tabular heading under No. 3\r\nof the neotropical subregions. [An error: should have been the\r\nAustralian.--A.R.W.]\r\n\r\nReviewers think it necessary to find some fault; and if I were to\r\nreview you, the sole point which I should blame is your not giving very\r\nnumerous references. These would save whoever follows you great\r\nlabour. Occasionally I wished myself to know the authority for certain\r\nstatements, and whether you or somebody else had originated certain\r\nsubordinate views. Take the case of a man who had collected largely on\r\nsome island, for instance St. Helena, and who wished to work out the\r\ngeographical relations of his collections: he would, I think, feel very\r\nblank at not finding in your work precise references to all that had\r\nbeen written on St. Helena. I hope you will not think me a confoundedly\r\ndisagreeable fellow.\r\n\r\nI may mention a capital essay which I received a few months ago\r\nfrom Axel Blytt (392/2. Axel Blytt, \"Essay on the Immigration of\r\nthe Norwegian Flora.\" Christiania, 1876. See Letter 387.) on the\r\ndistribution of the plants of Scandinavia; showing the high probability\r\nof there having been secular periods alternately wet and dry, and of the\r\nimportant part which they have played in distribution.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Forel (392/3. See Letter 388.), who is always at work\r\non ants, and told him your views about the dispersal of the blind\r\ncoleoptera, and asked him to observe.\r\n\r\nI spoke to Hooker about your book, and feel sure that he would like\r\nnothing better than to consider the distribution of plants in relation\r\nto your views; but he seemed to doubt whether he should ever have time.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have done my jottings, and once again congratulate you on\r\nhaving brought out so grand a work. I have been a little disappointed at\r\nthe review in \"Nature.\" (392/4. June 22nd, 1876, pages 165 et seq.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 393. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. Rosehill, Dorking, July\r\n23rd, 1876.\r\n\r\nI should have replied sooner to your last kind and interesting letters,\r\nbut they reached me in the midst of my packing previous to removal here,\r\nand I have only just now got my books and papers in a get-at-able state.\r\n\r\nAnd first, many thanks for your close observation in detecting the two\r\nabsurd mistakes in the tabular headings.\r\n\r\nAs to the former greater distinction of the North and South American\r\nfaunas, I think I am right. The edentata being proved (as I hold)\r\nto have been mere temporary migrants into North America in the\r\npost-Pliocene epoch, form no part of its Tertiary fauna. Yet in South\r\nAmerica they were so enormously developed in the Pliocene epoch that\r\nwe know, if there is any such thing as evolution, etc., that strange\r\nancestral forms must have preceded them in Miocene times.\r\n\r\nMastodon, on the other hand, represented by one or two species only,\r\nappears to have been a late immigrant into South America from the north.\r\n\r\nThe immense development of ungulates (in varied families, genera, and\r\nspecies) in North America during the whole Tertiary epoch is, however,\r\nthe great feature which assimilates it to Europe, and contrasts it\r\nwith South America. True camels, hosts of hog-like animals, true\r\nrhinoceroses, and hosts of ancestral horses, all bring the North\r\nAmerican [fauna] much nearer to the Old World than it is now. Even the\r\nhorse, represented in all South America by Equus only, was probably a\r\ntemporary immigrant from the north.\r\n\r\nAs to extending too far the principle (yours) of the necessity of\r\ncomparatively large areas for the development of varied faunas, I may\r\nhave done so, but I think not. There is, I think, every probability that\r\nmost islands, etc., where a varied fauna now exists, have been once more\r\nextensive--eg., New Zealand, Madagascar: where there is no such evidence\r\n(e.g., Galapagos), the fauna is very restricted.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to want of references: I confess the justice of your\r\ncriticism; but I am dreadfully unsystematic. It is my first large work\r\ninvolving much of the labour of others. I began with the intention of\r\nwriting a comparatively short sketch, enlarged it, and added to it bit\r\nby bit; remodelled the tables, the headings, and almost everything else,\r\nmore than once, and got my materials in such confusion that it is a\r\nwonder it has not turned out far more crooked and confused than it is.\r\nI, no doubt, ought to have given references; but in many cases I found\r\nthe information so small and scattered, and so much had to be combined\r\nand condensed from conflicting authorities, that I hardly knew how\r\nto refer to them or where to leave off. Had I referred to all authors\r\nconsulted for every fact, I should have greatly increased the bulk of\r\nthe book, while a large portion of the references would be valueless\r\nin a few years, owing to later and better authorities. My experience\r\nof referring to references has generally been most unsatisfactory. One\r\nfinds, nine times out of ten, the fact is stated, and nothing more; or a\r\nreference to some third work not at hand!\r\n\r\nI wish I could get into the habit of giving chapter and verse for every\r\nfact and extract; but I am too lazy, and generally in a hurry, having to\r\nconsult books against time, when in London for a day.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will try to do something to mend this matter, should I have\r\nto prepare another edition.\r\n\r\nI return you Forel's letter. It does not advance the question much;\r\nneither do I think it likely that even the complete observation he\r\nthinks necessary would be of much use, because it may well be that the\r\nova, or larvae, or imagos of the beetles are not carried systematically\r\nby the ants, but only occasionally, owing to some exceptional\r\ncircumstances. This might produce a great effect in distribution, yet be\r\nso rare as never to come under observation.\r\n\r\nSeveral of your remarks in previous letters I shall carefully consider.\r\nI know that, compared with the extent of the subject, my book is in\r\nmany parts crude and ill-considered; but I thought, and still think, it\r\nbetter to make some generalisations wherever possible, as I am not at\r\nall afraid of having to alter my views in many points of detail. I was\r\nso overwhelmed with zoological details, that I never went through the\r\nGeological Society's \"Journal\" as I ought to have done, and as I mean to\r\ndo before writing more on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 394. TO F. BUCHANAN WHITE.\r\n\r\n(394/1. \"Written in acknowledgment of a copy of a paper (published by me\r\nin the \"Proceedings of the Zoological Society\") on the Hemiptera of St.\r\nHelena, but discussing the origin of the whole fauna and flora of that\r\nisland.\"--F.B.W.)\r\n\r\nDown, September 23rd. [1878].\r\n\r\nI have now read your paper, and I hope that you will not think me\r\npresumptuous in writing another line to say how excellent it seems to\r\nme. I believe that you have largely solved the problem of the affinities\r\nof the inhabitants of this most interesting little island, and this is a\r\ndelightful triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 395. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 22nd [1879].\r\n\r\nI have just read Ball's Essay. (395/1. The late John Ball's lecture\r\n\"On the Origin of the Flora of the Alps\" in the \"Proceedings of the R.\r\nGeogr. Soc.\" 1879. Ball argues (page 18) that \"during ancient Palaeozoic\r\ntimes, before the deposition of the Coal-measures, the atmosphere\r\ncontained twenty times as much carbonic acid gas and considerably less\r\noxygen than it does at present.\" He further assumes that in such an\r\natmosphere the percentage of CO2 in the higher mountains would be\r\nexcessively different from that at the sea-level, and appends the result\r\nof calculations which gives the amount of CO2 at the sea-level as 100\r\nper 10,000 by weight, at a height of 10,000 feet as 12.5 per 10,000.\r\nDarwin understands him to mean that the Vascular Cryptogams and\r\nGymnosperms could stand the sea-level atmosphere, whereas the\r\nAngiosperms would only be able to exist in the higher regions where the\r\npercentage of CO2 was small. It is not clear to us that Ball relies so\r\nlargely on the condition of the atmosphere as regards CO2. If he does\r\nhe is clearly in error, for everything we know of assimilation points\r\nto the conclusion that 100 per 10,000 (1 per cent.) is by no means a\r\nhurtful amount of CO2, and that it would lead to an especially vigorous\r\nassimilation. Mountain plants would be more likely to descend to the\r\nplains to share in the rich feast than ascend to higher regions to avoid\r\nit. Ball draws attention to the imperfection of our plant records as\r\nregards the floras of mountain regions. It is, he thinks, conceivable\r\nthat there existed a vegetation on the Carboniferous mountains of which\r\nno traces have been preserved in the rocks. See \"Fossil Plants as Tests\r\nof Climate,\" page 40, A.C. Seward, 1892.\r\n\r\nSince the first part of this note was written, a paper has been read\r\n(May 29th, 1902) by Dr. H.T. Brown and Mr. F. Escombe, before the Royal\r\nSociety on \"The Influence of varying amounts of Carbon Dioxide in the\r\nAir on the Photosynthetic Process of Leaves, and on the Mode of Growth\r\nof Plants.\" The author's experiments included the cultivation of several\r\ndicotyledonous plants in an atmosphere containing in one case 180 to 200\r\ntimes the normal amount of CO2, and in another between three and four\r\ntimes the normal amount. The general results were practically identical\r\nin the two sets of experiments. \"All the species of flowering plants,\r\nwhich have been the subject of experiment, appear to be accurately\r\n'tuned' to an atmospheric environment of three parts of CO2 per 10,000,\r\nand the response which they make to slight increases in this amount\r\nare in a direction altogether unfavourable to their growth and\r\nreproduction.\" The assimilation of carbon increases with the increase in\r\nthe partial pressure of the CO2. But there seems to be a disturbance\r\nin metabolism, and the plants fail to take advantage of the increased\r\nsupply of CO2. The authors say:--\"All we are justified in concluding is,\r\nthat if such atmospheric variations have occurred since the advent\r\nof flowering plants, they must have taken place so slowly as never\r\nto outrun the possible adaptation of the plants to their changing\r\nconditions.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Farmer and Mr. S.E. Chandler gave an account, at the same meeting\r\nof the Royal Society, of their work \"On the Influence of an Excess of\r\nCarbon Dioxide in the Air on the Form and Internal Structure of Plants.\"\r\nThe results obtained were described as differing in a remarkable way\r\nfrom those previously recorded by Teodoresco (\"Rev. Gen. Botanique,\"\r\nII., 1899\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that Dr. Horace Brown and Mr. Escombe will extend their\r\nexperiments to Vascular Cryptogams, and thus obtain evidence bearing\r\nmore directly upon the question of an increased amount of CO2 in the\r\natmosphere of the Coal-period forests.) It is pretty bold. The rapid\r\ndevelopment as far as we can judge of all the higher plants within\r\nrecent geological times is an abominable mystery. Certainly it would be\r\na great step if we could believe that the higher plants at first could\r\nlive only at a high level; but until it is experimentally [proved] that\r\nCycadeae, ferns, etc., can withstand much more carbonic acid than the\r\nhigher plants, the hypothesis seems to me far too rash. Saporta believes\r\nthat there was an astonishingly rapid development of the high plants,\r\nas soon [as] flower-frequenting insects were developed and favoured\r\nintercrossing. I should like to see this whole problem solved. I\r\nhave fancied that perhaps there was during long ages a small isolated\r\ncontinent in the S. Hemisphere which served as the birthplace of the\r\nhigher plants--but this is a wretchedly poor conjecture. It is odd\r\nthat Ball does not allude to the obvious fact that there must have\r\nbeen alpine plants before the Glacial period, many of which would have\r\nreturned to the mountains after the Glacial period, when the climate\r\nagain became warm. I always accounted to myself in this manner for the\r\ngentians, etc.\r\n\r\nBall ought also to have considered the alpine insects common to the\r\nArctic regions. I do not know how it may be with you, but my faith in\r\nthe glacial migration is not at all shaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 396. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(396/1. This letter is in reply to Mr. Darwin's criticisms on Mr.\r\nWallace's \"Island Life,\" 1880.)\r\n\r\nPen-y-Bryn, St. Peter's Road, Croydon, November 8th, 1880.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind remarks and notes on my book. Several of the\r\nlatter will be of use to me if I have to prepare a second edition, which\r\nI am not so sure of as you seem to be.\r\n\r\n1. In your remark as to the doubtfulness of paucity of fossils being due\r\nto coldness of water, I think you overlook that I am speaking only of\r\nwater in the latitude of the Alps, in Miocene and Eocene times, when\r\nicebergs and glaciers temporarily descended into an otherwise warm sea;\r\nmy theory being that there was no Glacial epoch at that time, but merely\r\na local and temporary descent of the snow-line and glaciers owing to\r\nhigh excentricity and winter in aphelion.\r\n\r\n2. I cannot see the difficulty about the cessation of the Glacial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nBetween the Miocene and the Pleistocene periods geographical changes\r\noccurred which rendered a true Glacial period possible with high\r\nexcentricity. When the high excentricity passed away the Glacial epoch\r\nalso passed away in the temperate zone; but it persists in the arctic\r\nzone, where, during the Miocene, there were mild climates, and this\r\nis due to the persistence of the changed geographical conditions. The\r\npresent arctic climate is itself a comparatively new and abnormal state\r\nof things, due to geographical modification.\r\n\r\nAs to \"epoch\" and \"period,\" I use them as synonyms to avoid repeating\r\nthe same word.\r\n\r\n3. Rate of deposition and geological time. Here no doubt I may have\r\ngone to an extreme, but my \"28 million years\" may be anything under 100\r\nmillions, as I state. There is an enormous difference between mean and\r\nmaximum denudation and deposition. In the case of the great faults\r\nthe upheaval along a given line would itself facilitate the denudation\r\n(whether sub-aerial or marine) of the upheaved portion at a rate perhaps\r\na hundred times above the average, just as valleys have been denuded\r\nperhaps a hundred times faster than plains and plateaux. So local\r\nsubsidence might itself lead to very rapid deposition. Suppose a portion\r\nof the Gulf of Mexico, near the mouths of the Mississippi, were to\r\nsubside for a few thousand years, it might receive the greater portion\r\nof the sediment from the whole Mississippi valley, and thus form strata\r\nat a very rapid rate.\r\n\r\n4. You quote the Pampas thistles, etc., against my statement of the\r\nimportance of preoccupation. But I am referring especially to St.\r\nHelena, and to plants naturally introduced from the adjacent continents.\r\nSurely if a certain number of African plants reached the island, and\r\nbecame modified into a complete adaptation to its climatic conditions,\r\nthey would hardly be expelled by other African plants arriving\r\nsubsequently. They might be so, conceivably, but it does not seem\r\nprobable. The cases of the Pampas, New Zealand, Tahiti, etc., are\r\nvery different, where highly developed aggressive plants have been\r\nartificially introduced. Under nature it is these very aggressive\r\nspecies that would first reach any island in their vicinity, and, being\r\nadapted to the island and colonising it thoroughly, would then hold\r\ntheir own against other plants from the same country, mostly less\r\naggressive in character.\r\n\r\nI have not explained this so fully as I should have done in the book.\r\nYour criticism is therefore useful.\r\n\r\n5. My Chapter XXIII. is no doubt very speculative, and I cannot wonder\r\nat your hesitating at accepting my views. To me, however, your theory of\r\nhosts of existing species migrating over the tropical lowlands from the\r\nN. temperate to the S. temperate zone appears more speculative and\r\nmore improbable. For where could the rich lowland equatorial flora have\r\nexisted during a period of general refrigeration sufficient for this?\r\nand what became of the wonderfully rich Cape flora, which, if the\r\ntemperature of tropical Africa had been so recently lowered, would\r\ncertainly have spread northwards, and on the return of the heat\r\ncould hardly have been driven back into the sharply defined and very\r\nrestricted area in which it now exists.\r\n\r\nAs to the migration of plants from mountain to mountain not being so\r\nprobable as to remote islands, I think that is fully counterbalanced by\r\ntwo considerations:--\r\n\r\na. The area and abundance of the mountain stations along such a range\r\nas the Andes are immensely greater than those of the islands in the N.\r\nAtlantic, for example.\r\n\r\nb. The temporary occupation of mountain stations by migrating plants\r\n(which I think I have shown to be probable) renders time a much more\r\nimportant element in increasing the number and variety of the plants so\r\ndispersed than in the case of islands, where the flora soon acquires\r\na fixed and endemic character, and where the number of species is\r\nnecessarily limited.\r\n\r\nNo doubt direct evidence of seeds being carried great distances through\r\nthe air is wanted, but I am afraid can hardly be obtained. Yet I feel\r\nthe greatest confidence that they are so carried. Take, for instance,\r\nthe two peculiar orchids of the Azores (Habenaria sp.) What other mode\r\nof transit is conceivable? The whole subject is one of great difficulty,\r\nbut I hope my chapter may call attention to a hitherto neglected factor\r\nin the distribution of plants.\r\n\r\nYour references to the Mauritius literature are very interesting, and\r\nwill be useful to me; and I again thank you for your valuable remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 397. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(397/1. The following letters were written to Sir J.D. Hooker when he\r\nwas preparing his Address as President of the Geographical Section of\r\nthe British Association at its fiftieth meeting, at York. The second\r\nletter (August 12th) refers to an earlier letter of August 6th,\r\npublished in \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 246.)\r\n\r\n4, Bryanston Street, W., Saturday, 26th [February, 1881].\r\n\r\nI should think that you might make a very interesting address on\r\nGeographical Distribution. Could you give a little history of the\r\nsubject. I, for one, should like to read such history in petto; but I\r\ncan see one very great difficulty--that you yourself ought to figure\r\nmost prominently in it; and this you would not do, for you are just the\r\nman to treat yourself in a dishonourable manner. I should very much like\r\nto see you discuss some of Wallace's views, especially his ignoring\r\nthe all-powerful effects of the Glacial period with respect to alpine\r\nplants. (397/2. \"Having been kindly permitted by Mr. Francis Darwin to\r\nread this letter, I wish to explain that the above statement applies\r\nonly to my rejection of Darwin's view that the presence of arctic and\r\nnorth temperate plants in the SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE was brought about\r\nby the lowering of the temperature of the tropical regions during the\r\nGlacial period, so that even 'the lowlands of these great continents\r\nwere everywhere tenanted under the equator by a considerable number of\r\ntemperate forms (\"Origin of Species,\" Edition VI., page 338). My\r\nown views are fully explained in Chapter XXIII. of my \"Island Life,\"\r\npublished in 1880. I quite accept all that Darwin, Hooker, and Asa Gray\r\nhave written about the effect of the Glacial epoch in bringing about\r\nthe present distribution of alpine and arctic plants in the NORTHERN\r\nHEMISPHERE.\"--Note by Mr. Wallace.) I do not know what you think, but it\r\nappears to me that he exaggerates enormously the influence of debacles\r\nor slips and new surface of soil being exposed for the reception of\r\nwind-blown seeds. What kinds of seeds have the plants which are common\r\nto the distant mountain-summits in Africa? Wallace lately wrote to me\r\nabout the mountain plants of Madagascar being the same with those on\r\nmountains in Africa, and seemed to think it proved dispersal by the\r\nwind, without apparently having inquired what sorts of seeds the plants\r\nbore. (397/3. The affinity with the flora of the Eastern African islands\r\nwas long ago pointed out by Sir J.D. Hooker, \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" VI.,\r\n1861, page 3. Speaking of the plants of Clarence Peak in Fernando Po, he\r\nsays, \"The next affinity is with Mauritius, Bourbon, and Madagascar:\r\nof the whole 76 species, 16 inhabit these places and 8 more are closely\r\nallied to plants from there. Three temperate species are peculiar to\r\nClarence Peak and the East African islands...\" The facts to which\r\nMr. Wallace called Darwin's attention are given by Mr. J.G. Baker in\r\n\"Nature,\" December 9th, 1880, page 125. He mentions the Madagascar\r\nViola, which occurs elsewhere only at 7,000 feet in the Cameroons, at\r\n10,000 feet in Fernando Po and in the Abyssinian mountains; and the same\r\nthing is true of the Madagascar Geranium. In Mr. Wallace's letter\r\nto Darwin, dated January 1st, 1881, he evidently uses the expression\r\n\"passing through the air\" in contradistinction to the migration of a\r\nspecies by gradual extension of its area on land. \"Through the air\"\r\nwould moreover include occasional modes of transport other than simple\r\ncarriage by wind: e.g., the seeds might be carried by birds, either\r\nattached to the feathers or to the mud on their feet, or in their crops\r\nor intestines.)\r\n\r\nI suppose it would be travelling too far (though for the geographical\r\nsection the discussion ought to be far-reaching), but I should like\r\nto see the European or northern element in the Cape of Good Hope\r\nflora discussed. I cannot swallow Wallace's view that European plants\r\ntravelled down the Andes, tenanted the hypothetical Antarctic continent\r\n(in which I quite believe), and thence spread to South Australia and the\r\nCape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nMoseley told me not long ago that he proposed to search at Kerguelen\r\nLand the coal beds most carefully, and was absolutely forbidden to do\r\nso by Sir W. Thomson, who said that he would undertake the work, and he\r\nnever once visited them. This puts me in a passion. I hope that you will\r\nkeep to your intention and make an address on distribution. Though I\r\ndiffer so much from Wallace, his \"Island Life\" seems to me a wonderful\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nFarewell. I do hope that you may have a most prosperous journey. Give my\r\nkindest remembrances to Asa Gray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 398. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 12th, 1881.\r\n\r\n...I think that I must have expressed myself badly about Humboldt.\r\nI should have said that he was more remarkable for his astounding\r\nknowledge than for originality. I have always looked at him as, in fact,\r\nthe founder of the geographical distribution of organisms. I thought\r\nthat I had read that extinct fossil plants belonging to Australian forms\r\nhad lately been found in Australia, and all such cases seem to me very\r\ninteresting, as bearing on development.\r\n\r\nI have been so astonished at the apparently sudden coming in of the\r\nhigher phanerogams, that I have sometimes fancied that development might\r\nhave slowly gone on for an immense period in some isolated continent or\r\nlarge island, perhaps near the South Pole. I poured out my idle thoughts\r\nin writing, as if I had been talking with you.\r\n\r\nNo fact has so interested me for a heap of years as your case of the\r\nplants on the equatorial mountains of Africa; and Wallace tells me that\r\nsome one (Baker?) has described analogous cases on the mountains of\r\nMadagascar (398/1. See Letter 397, note.)...I think that you ought to\r\nallude to these cases.\r\n\r\nI most fully agree that no problem is more interesting than that of\r\nthe temperate forms in the southern hemisphere, common to the north. I\r\nremember writing about this after Wallace's book appeared, and hoping\r\nthat you would take it up. The frequency with which the drainage from\r\nthe land passes through mountain-chains seems to indicate some general\r\nlaw--viz., the successive formation of cracks and lines of elevation\r\nbetween the nearest ocean and the already upraised land; but that is too\r\nbig a subject for a note.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether any insects can be shown with any probability to have\r\nbeen flower feeders before the middle of the Secondary period. Several\r\nof the asserted cases have broken down.\r\n\r\nYour long letter has stirred many pleasant memories of long past days,\r\nwhen we had many a discussion and many a good fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 399. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 21st, 1881.\r\n\r\nI cannot aid you much, or at all. I should think that no one could\r\nhave thought on the modification of species without thinking of\r\nrepresentative species. But I feel sure that no discussion of any\r\nimportance had been published on this subject before the \"Origin,\"\r\nfor if I had known of it I should assuredly have alluded to it in the\r\n\"Origin,\" as I wished to gain support from all quarters. I did not then\r\nknow of Von Buch's view (alluded to in my Historical Introduction in all\r\nthe later editions). Von Buch published his \"Isles Canaries\" in 1836,\r\nand he here briefly argues that plants spread over a continent and\r\nvary, and the varieties in time come to be species. He also argues that\r\nclosely allied species have been thus formed in the SEPARATE valleys of\r\nthe Canary Islands, but not on the upper and open parts. I could lend\r\nyou Von Buch's book, if you like. I have just consulted the passage.\r\n\r\nI have not Baer's papers; but, as far as I remember, the subject is not\r\nfully discussed by him.\r\n\r\nI quite agree about Wallace's position on the ocean and continent\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nTo return to geographical distribution: As far as I know, no one ever\r\ndiscussed the meaning of the relation between representative species\r\nbefore I did, and, as I suppose, Wallace did in his paper before the\r\nLinnean Society. Von Buch's is the nearest approach to such discussion\r\nknown to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 400. TO W.D. CRICK.\r\n\r\n(400/1. The following letters are interesting not only for their own\r\nsake, but because they tell the history of the last of Mr. Darwin's\r\npublications--his letter to \"Nature\" on the \"Dispersal of Freshwater\r\nBivalves,\" April 6th, 1882.)\r\n\r\nDown, February 21st, 1882.\r\n\r\nYour fact is an interesting one, and I am very much obliged to you for\r\ncommunicating it to me. You speak a little doubtfully about the name of\r\nthe shell, and it would be indispensable to have this ascertained with\r\ncertainty. Do you know any good conchologist in Northampton who could\r\nname it? If so I should be obliged if you would inform me of the result.\r\n\r\nAlso the length and breadth of the shell, and how much of leg (which\r\nleg?) of the Dytiscus [a large water-beetle] has been caught. If you\r\ncannot get the shell named I could take it to the British Museum when I\r\nnext go to London; but this probably will not occur for about six weeks,\r\nand you may object to lend the specimen for so long a time.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that the case would be worth communicating to\r\n\"Nature.\"\r\n\r\nP.S.--I suppose that the animal in the shell must have been alive when\r\nthe Dytiscus was captured, otherwise the adductor muscle of the shell\r\nwould have relaxed and the shell dropped off.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 401. TO W.D. CRICK. Down, February 25th, 1882.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your clear and distinct answers to my questions.\r\nI am sorry to trouble you, but there is one point which I do not fully\r\nunderstand. Did the shell remain attached to the beetle's leg from the\r\n18th to the 23rd, and was the beetle kept during this time in the air?\r\n\r\nDo I understand rightly that after the shell had dropped off, both being\r\nin water, that the beetle's antenna was again temporarily caught by the\r\nshell?\r\n\r\nI presume that I may keep the specimen till I go to London, which will\r\nbe about the middle of next month.\r\n\r\nI have placed the shell in fresh-water, to see if the valve will open,\r\nand whether it is still alive, for this seems to me a very interesting\r\npoint. As the wretched beetle was still feebly alive, I have put it in\r\na bottle with chopped laurel leaves, that it may die an easy and quicker\r\ndeath. I hope that I shall meet with your approval in doing so.\r\n\r\nOne of my sons tells me that on the coast of N. Wales the bare fishing\r\nhooks often bring up young mussels which have seized hold of the points;\r\nbut I must make further enquiries on this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 402. TO W.D. CRICK. Down, March 23rd, 1882.\r\n\r\nI have had a most unfortunate and extraordinary accident with your\r\nshell. I sent it by post in a strong box to Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys to be\r\nnamed, and heard two days afterwards that he had started for Italy.\r\nI then wrote to the servant in charge of his house to open the parcel\r\n(within which was a cover stamped and directed to myself) and return\r\nit to me. This servant, I suppose, opened the box and dropped the glass\r\ntube on a stone floor, and perhaps put his foot on it, for the tube and\r\nshell were broken into quite small fragments. These were returned to me\r\nwith no explanation, the box being quite uninjured. I suppose you would\r\nnot care for the fragments to be returned or the Dytiscus; but if you\r\nwish for them they shall be returned. I am very sorry, but it has not\r\nbeen my fault.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me almost useless to send the fragments of the shell to the\r\nBritish Museum to be named, more especially as the umbo has been lost.\r\nIt is many years since I have looked at a fresh-water shell, but I\r\nshould have said that the shell was Cyclas cornea. (402/1. It was Cyclas\r\ncornea.) Is Sphaenium corneum a synonym of Cyclas? Perhaps you could\r\ntell by looking to Mr. G. Jeffreys' book. If so, may we venture to call\r\nit so, or shall I put an (?) to the name?\r\n\r\nAs soon as I hear from you I will send my letter to \"Nature.\" Do you\r\ntake in \"Nature,\" or shall I send you a copy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.VIII.--MAN.\r\n\r\nI. Descent of Man.--II. Sexual Selection.--III. Expression of the\r\nEmotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.VIII.I. DESCENT OF MAN, 1860-1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 403. TO C. LYELL. Down, April 27th [1860].\r\n\r\nI cannot explain why, but to me it would be an infinite satisfaction to\r\nbelieve that mankind will progress to such a pitch that we should [look]\r\nback at [ourselves] as mere Barbarians. I have received proof-sheets\r\n(with a wonderfully nice letter) of very hostile review by Andrew\r\nMurray, read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh. (403/1. \"On Mr.\r\nDarwin's Theory of the Origin of Species,\" by Andrew Murray. \"Proc. Roy.\r\nSoc., Edinb.\" Volume IV., pages 274-91, 1862. The review concludes with\r\nthe following sentence: \"I have come to be of opinion that Mr. Darwin's\r\ntheory is unsound, and that I am to be spared any collision between my\r\ninclination and my convictions\" (referring to the writer's belief in\r\nDesign).) But I am tired with answering it. Indeed I have done nothing\r\nthe whole day but answer letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 404. TO L. HORNER.\r\n\r\n(404/1. The following letter occurs in the \"Memoir of Leonard Horner,\r\nedited by his daughter Katherine M. Lyell,\" Volume II., page 300\r\n(privately printed, 1890).)\r\n\r\nDown, March 20th [1861].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your Address (404/2. Mr. Horner's Anniversary\r\nAddress to the Geological Society (\"Proc. Geol. Soc.\" XVII., 1861).)\r\nwhich has interested me much...I thought that I had read up pretty well\r\non the antiquity of man; but you bring all the facts so well together in\r\na condensed focus, that the case seems much clearer to me. How curious\r\nabout the Bible! (404/3. At page lxviii. Mr. Horner points out that the\r\n\"chronology, given in the margin of our Bibles,\" i.e., the statement\r\nthat the world was created 4004 B.C., is the work of Archbishop Usher,\r\nand is in no way binding on those who believe in the inspiration of\r\nScripture. Mr. Horner goes on (page lxx): \"The retention of the marginal\r\nnote in question is by no means a matter of indifference; it is untrue,\r\nand therefore it is mischievous.\" It is interesting that Archbishop\r\nSumner and Dr. Dawes, Dean of Hereford, wrote with approbation of Mr.\r\nHorner's views on Man. The Archbishop says: \"I have always considered\r\nthe first verse of Genesis as indicating, rather than denying, a\r\nPREADAMITE world\" (\"Memoir of Leonard Horner, II.\", page 303).) I declare\r\nI had fancied that the date was somehow in the Bible. You are coming out\r\nin a new light as a Biblical critic. I must thank you for some remarks\r\non the \"Origin of Species\" (404/4. Mr. Horner (page xxxix) begins by\r\ndisclaiming the qualifications of a competent critic, and confines\r\nhimself to general remarks on the philosophic candour and freedom from\r\ndogmatism of the \"Origin\": he does, however, give an opinion on the\r\ngeological chapters IX. and X. As a general criticism he quotes Mr.\r\nHuxley's article in the \"Westminster Review,\" which may now be read in\r\n\"Collected Essays,\" II., page 22.) (though I suppose it is almost as\r\nincorrect to do so as to thank a judge for a favourable verdict): what\r\nyou have said has pleased me extremely. I am the more pleased, as I\r\nwould rather have been well attacked than have been handled in the\r\nnamby-pamby, old-woman style of the cautious Oxford Professor. (404/5.\r\nThis no doubt refers to Professor Phillips' \"Life on the Earth,\" 1860, a\r\nbook founded on the author's \"Rede Lecture,\" given before the University\r\nof Cambridge. Reference to this work will be found in \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., pages 309, 358, 373.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 405. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(405/1. Mr. Wallace was, we believe, the first to treat the evolution of\r\nMan in any detail from the point of view of Natural Selection,\r\nnamely, in a paper in the \"Anthropological Review and Journal of the\r\nAnthropological Society,\" May 1864, page clviii. The deep interest with\r\nwhich Mr. Darwin read his copy is graphically recorded in the continuous\r\nseries of pencil-marks along the margins of the pages. His views are\r\nfully given in Letter 406. The phrase, \"in this case it is too far,\"\r\nrefers to Mr. Wallace's habit of speaking of the theory of Natural\r\nSelection as due entirely to Darwin.)\r\n\r\nMay 22nd 1864.\r\n\r\nI have now read Wallace's paper on Man, and think it MOST striking and\r\noriginal and forcible. I wish he had written Lyell's chapters on Man.\r\n(405/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 11 et seq. for Darwin's\r\ndisappointment over Lyell's treatment of the evolutionary question in\r\nhis \"Antiquity of Man\"; see also page 29 for Lyell's almost pathetic\r\nwords about his own position between the discarded faith of many years\r\nand the new one not yet assimilated. See also Letters 132, 164, 170.) I\r\nquite agree about his high-mindedness, and have long thought so; but in\r\nthis case it is too far, and I shall tell him so. I am not sure that\r\nI fully agree with his views about Man, but there is no doubt, in my\r\nopinion, on the remarkable genius shown by the paper. I agree, however,\r\nto the main new leading idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 406. TO A.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n(406/1. This letter was published in \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 89.)\r\n\r\nDown, [May] 28th [1864].\r\n\r\nI am so much better that I have just finished a paper for the Linnean\r\nSociety (406/2. On the three forms, etc., of Lythrum.); but I am not yet\r\nat all strong, I felt much disinclination to write, and therefore you\r\nmust forgive me for not having sooner thanked you for your paper on\r\nMan (406/3. \"Anthropological Review,\" May 1864.) received on the 11th.\r\n(406/4. Mr. Wallace wrote, May 10th, 1864: \"I send you now my little\r\ncontribution to the theory of the origin of man. I hope you will be able\r\nto agree with me. If you are able [to write] I shall be glad to have\r\nyour criticisms. I was led to the subject by the necessity of explaining\r\nthe vast mental and cranial differences between man and the apes\r\ncombined with such small structural differences in other parts of the\r\nbody,--and also by an endeavour to account for the diversity of human\r\nraces combined with man's almost perfect stability of form during all\r\nhistorical epochs.\" But first let me say that I have hardly ever in my\r\nlife been more struck by any paper than that on \"Variation,\" etc., etc.,\r\nin the \"Reader.\" (406/5. \"Reader,\" April 16th, 1864, an abstract of Mr.\r\nWallace: \"On the Phenomena of Variation and Geographical Distribution\r\nas illustrated by the Papilionidae of the Malayan Region.\" \"Linn.\r\nSoc. Trans.\" XXV.) I feel sure that such papers will do more for the\r\nspreading of our views on the modification of species than any separate\r\ntreatises on the simple subject itself. It is really admirable; but you\r\nought not in the Man paper to speak of the theory as mine; it is just\r\nas much yours as mine. One correspondent has already noticed to me your\r\n\"high-minded\" conduct on this head.\r\n\r\nBut now for your Man paper, about which I should like to write more than\r\nI can. The great leading idea is quite new to me--viz. that during late\r\nages the mind will have been modified more than the body; yet I had got\r\nas far as to see with you, that the struggle between the races of man\r\ndepended entirely on intellectual and moral qualities. The latter part\r\nof the paper I can designate only as grand and most eloquently done. I\r\nhave shown your paper to two or three persons who have been here, and\r\nthey have been equally struck with it. I am not sure that I go with you\r\non all minor points: when reading Sir G. Grey's account of the constant\r\nbattles of Australian savages, I remember thinking that Natural\r\nSelection would come in, and likewise with the Esquimaux, with whom the\r\nart of fishing and managing canoes is said to be hereditary. I rather\r\ndiffer on the rank, under a classificatory point of view, which you\r\nassign to man; I do not think any character simply in excess ought ever\r\nto be used for the higher divisions. Ants would not be separated from\r\nother hymenopterous insects, however high the instinct of the one, and\r\nhowever low the instincts of the other. With respect to the differences\r\nof race, a conjecture has occurred to me that much may be due to the\r\ncorrelation of complexion (and consequently hair) with constitution.\r\nAssume that a dusky individual best escaped miasma, and you will\r\nreadily see what I mean. I persuaded the Director-General of the Medical\r\nDepartment of the Army to send printed forms to the surgeons of all\r\nregiments in tropical countries to ascertain this point, but I daresay\r\nI shall never get any returns. Secondly, I suspect that a sort of sexual\r\nselection has been the most powerful means of changing the races of man.\r\nI can show that the different races have a widely different standard of\r\nbeauty. Among savages the most powerful men will have the pick of\r\nthe women, and they will generally leave the most descendants. I have\r\ncollected a few notes on man, but I do not suppose I shall ever use\r\nthem. Do you intend to follow out your views? and if so, would you like\r\nat some future time to have my few references and notes? I am sure I\r\nhardly know whether they are of any value, and they are at present in a\r\nstate of chaos.\r\n\r\nThere is much more that I should like to write, but I have not strength.\r\n\r\nP.S. Our aristocracy is handsomer (more hideous according to a Chinese\r\nor Negro) than the middle classes, from [having the] pick of the women;\r\nbut oh, what a scheme is primogeniture for destroying Natural Selection!\r\nI fear my letter will be barely intelligible to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 406* A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. 5, Westbourne Grove Terrace,\r\nW., May 29th [1864].\r\n\r\nYou are always so ready to appreciate what others do, and especially to\r\noverestimate my desultory efforts, that I cannot be surprised at your\r\nvery kind and flattering remarks on my papers. I am glad, however, that\r\nyou have made a few critical observations (and am only sorry that you\r\nwere not well enough to make more), as that enables me to say a few\r\nwords in explanation.\r\n\r\nMy great fault is haste. An idea strikes me, I think over it for a few\r\ndays, and then write away with such illustrations as occur to me while\r\ngoing on. I therefore look at the subject almost solely from one\r\npoint of view. Thus, in my paper on Man (406*/1. Published in the\r\n\"Anthropological Review,\" 1864.), I aim solely at showing that brutes\r\nare modified in a great variety of ways by Natural Selection, but that\r\nin none of these particular ways can Man be modified, because of the\r\nsuperiority of his intellect. I therefore no doubt overlook a few\r\nsmaller points in which Natural Selection may still act on men and\r\nbrutes alike. Colour is one of them, and I have alluded to this in\r\ncorrelation to constitution, in an abstract I have made at Sclater's\r\nrequest for the \"Natural History Review.\" (406*/2. \"Nat. Hist. Review,\"\r\n1864, page 328.) At the same time, there is so much evidence of\r\nmigrations and displacements of races of man, and so many cases of\r\npeoples of distinct physical characters inhabiting the same or similar\r\nregions, and also of races of uniform physical characters inhabiting\r\nwidely dissimilar regions,--that the external characteristics of the\r\nchief races of man must, I think, be older than his present geographical\r\ndistribution, and the modifications produced by correlation to\r\nfavourable variations of constitution be only a secondary cause of\r\nexternal modification. I hope you may get the returns from the Army.\r\n(406*/3. Measurements taken of more than one million soldiers in the\r\nUnited States showed that \"local influences of some kind act directly\r\non structure.\"--\"Descent of Man,\" 1901, page 45.) They would be very\r\ninteresting, but I do not expect the results would be favourable to your\r\nview.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the constant battles of savages leading to selection of\r\nphysical superiority, I think it would be very imperfect and subject to\r\nso many exceptions and irregularities that it would produce no definite\r\nresult. For instance: the strongest and bravest men would lead, and\r\nexpose themselves most, and would therefore be most subject to wounds\r\nand death. And the physical energy which led to any one tribe delighting\r\nin war, might lead to its extermination, by inducing quarrels with\r\nall surrounding tribes and leading them to combine against it. Again,\r\nsuperior cunning, stealth, and swiftness of foot, or even better\r\nweapons, would often lead to victory as well as mere physical strength.\r\nMoreover, this kind of more or less perpetual war goes on amongst savage\r\npeoples. It could lead, therefore, to no differential characters, but\r\nmerely to the keeping up of a certain average standard of bodily and\r\nmental health and vigour.\r\n\r\nSo with selection of variations adapted to special habits of life as\r\nfishing, paddling, riding, climbing, etc., etc., in different races,\r\nno doubt it must act to some extent, but will it be ever so rigid as to\r\ninduce a definite physical modification, and can we imagine it to have\r\nhad any part in producing the distinct races that now exist?\r\n\r\nThe sexual selection you allude to will also, I think, have been equally\r\nuncertain in its results. In the very lowest tribes there is rarely much\r\npolygamy, and women are more or less a matter of purchase. There is also\r\nlittle difference of social condition, and I think it rarely happens\r\nthat any healthy and undeformed man remains without wife and children.\r\nI very much doubt the often-repeated assertion that our aristocracy\r\nare more beautiful than the middle classes. I allow that they present\r\nspecimens of the highest kind of beauty, but I doubt the average. I have\r\nnoticed in country places a greater average amount of good looks among\r\nthe middle classes, and besides we unavoidably combine in our idea of\r\nbeauty, intellectual expression, and refinement of manner, which often\r\nmakes the less appear the more beautiful. Mere physical beauty--i.e. a\r\nhealthy and regular development of the body and features approaching to\r\nthe mean and type of European man, I believe is quite as frequent in one\r\nclass of society as the other, and much more frequent in rural districts\r\nthan in cities.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the rank of man in zoological classification, I fear I\r\nhave not made myself intelligible. I never meant to adopt Owen's or any\r\nother such views, but only to point out that from one point of view he\r\nwas right. I hold that a distinct family for Man, as Huxley allows, is\r\nall that can possibly be given him zoologically. But at the same time,\r\nif my theory is true, that while the animals which surrounded him have\r\nbeen undergoing modification in all parts of their bodies to a generic\r\nor even family degree of difference, he has been changing almost wholly\r\nin the brain and head--then in geological antiquity the SPECIES man may\r\nbe as old as many mammalian families, and the origin of the FAMILY man\r\nmay date back to a period when some of the ORDERS first originated.\r\n\r\nAs to the theory of Natural Selection itself, I shall always maintain it\r\nto be actually yours and yours only. You had worked it out in details I\r\nhad never thought of, years before I had a ray of light on the subject,\r\nand my paper would never have convinced anybody or been noticed as more\r\nthan an ingenious speculation, whereas your book has revolutionised the\r\nstudy of Natural History, and carried away captive the best men of\r\nthe present age. All the merit I claim is the having been the means of\r\ninducing you to write and publish at once. I may possibly some day go a\r\nlittle more into this subject (of Man), and if I do will accept the kind\r\noffer of your notes.\r\n\r\nI am now, however, beginning to write the \"Narrative of my Travels,\"\r\nwhich will occupy me a long time, as I hate writing narrative, and after\r\nBates' brilliant success rather fear to fail.\r\n\r\nI shall introduce a few chapters on Geographical Distribution and other\r\nsuch topics. Sir C. Lyell, while agreeing with my main argument on Man,\r\nthinks I am wrong in wanting to put him back into Miocene times, and\r\nthinks I do not appreciate the immense interval even to the later\r\nPliocene. But I still maintain my view, which in fact is a logical\r\nresult of my theory; for if man originated in later Pliocene, when\r\nalmost all mammalia were of closely allied species to those now living,\r\nand many even identical, then man has not been stationary in bodily\r\nstructure while animals have been varying, and my theory will be proved\r\nto be all wrong.\r\n\r\nIn Murchison's address to the Geographical Society, just delivered, he\r\npoints out Africa as being the oldest existing land. He says there is\r\nno evidence of its having been ever submerged during the Tertiary epoch.\r\nHere then is evidently the place to find early man. I hope something\r\ngood may be found in Borneo, and that the means may be found to explore\r\nthe still more promising regions of tropical Africa, for we can expect\r\nnothing of man very early in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt has given me great pleasure to find that there are symptoms of\r\nimprovement in your health. I hope you will not exert yourself too soon\r\nor write more than is quite agreeable to you. I think I made out every\r\nword of your letter, though it was not always easy.\r\n\r\n(406*/4. For Wallace's later views see Letter 408, note.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 407. TO W. TURNER.\r\n\r\n(407/1. Sir William Turner is frequently referred to in the \"Descent of\r\nMan\" as having supplied Mr. Darwin with information.)\r\n\r\nDown, December 14th [1866].\r\n\r\nYour kindness when I met you at the Royal Society makes me think that\r\nyou would grant me the favour of a little information, if in your power.\r\nI am preparing a book on Domestic Animals, and as there has been so much\r\ndiscussion on the bearing of such views as I hold on Man, I have some\r\nthoughts of adding a chapter on this subject. The point on which I\r\nwant information is in regard to any part which may be fairly called\r\nrudimentary in comparison with the same part in the Quadrumana or any\r\nother mammal. Now the os coccyx is rudimentary as a tail, and I am\r\nanxious to hear about its muscles. Mr. Flower found for me in some work\r\nthat its one muscle (with striae) was supposed only to bring this bone\r\nback to its proper position after parturition. This seems to me hardly\r\ncredible. He said he had never particularly examined this part, and when\r\nI mentioned your name, he said you were the most likely man to give me\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nAre there any traces of other muscles? It seems strange if there are\r\nnone. Do you know how the muscles are in this part in the anthropoid\r\napes? The muscles of the ear in man may, I suppose, in most cases be\r\nconsidered as rudimentary; and so they seem to be in the anthropoids;\r\nat least, I am assured in the Zoological Gardens they do not erect their\r\nears. I gather there are a good many muscles in various parts of the\r\nbody which are in this same state: could you specify any of the best\r\ncases? The mammae in man are rudimentary. Are there any other glands or\r\nother organs which you can think of? I know I have no right whatever to\r\nask all these questions, and can only say that I should be grateful for\r\nany information. If you tell me anything about the os coccyx or other\r\nstructures, I hope that you will permit me to quote the statement on\r\nyour authority, as that would add so greatly to its value.\r\n\r\nPray excuse me for troubling you, and do not hurry yourself in the least\r\nin answering me.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether you would care to possess a copy, but I told my\r\npublisher to send you a copy of the new edition of the \"Origin\" last\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 408. TO W. TURNER. Down, February 1st [1867].\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for all your full information, and I regret much\r\nthat I have given you such great trouble at a period when your time is\r\nso much occupied. But the facts were so valuable to me that I cannot\r\npretend that I am sorry that I did trouble you; and I am the less so,\r\nas from what you say I hope you may be induced some time to write a full\r\naccount of all rudimentary structures in Man: it would be a very curious\r\nand interesting memoir. I shall at present give only a brief abstract\r\nof the chief facts which you have so very kindly communicated to me, and\r\nwill not touch on some of the doubtful points. I have received far more\r\ninformation than I ventured to anticipate. There is one point which has\r\noccurred to me, but I suspect there is nothing in it. If, however, there\r\nshould be, perhaps you will let me have a brief note from you, and if\r\nI do not hear I will understand there is nothing in the notion. I have\r\nincluded the down on the human body and the lanugo on the foetus as a\r\nrudimentary representation of a hairy coat. (408/1. \"Descent of Man\"\r\nI., page 25; II., page 375.) I do not know whether there is any direct\r\nfunctional connection between the presence of hair and the panniculus\r\ncarnosus (408/2. Professor Macalister draws our attention to the fact\r\nthat Mr. Darwin uses the term panniculus in the generalised sense of any\r\nsheet of muscle acting on the skin.) (to put the question under\r\nanother point of view, is it the primary or aboriginal function of the\r\npanniculus to move the dermal appendages or the skin itself?); but both\r\nare superficial, and would perhaps together become rudimentary. I was\r\nled to think of this by the places (as far as my ignorance of anatomy\r\nhas allowed me to judge) of the rudimentary muscular fasciculi which you\r\nspecify. Now, some persons can move the skin of their hairy heads; and\r\nis this not effected by the panniculus? How is it with the eyebrows? You\r\nspecify the axillae and the front region of the chest and lower part of\r\nscapulae: now, these are all hairy spots in man. On the other hand,\r\nthe neck, and as I suppose the covering of the gluteus medius, are not\r\nhairy; so, as I said, I presume there is nothing in this notion. If\r\nthere were, the rudiments of the panniculus ought perhaps to occur more\r\nplainly in man than in woman...\r\n\r\nP.S.--If the skin on the head is moved by the panniculus, I think I\r\nought just to allude to it, as some men alone having power to move the\r\nskin shows that the apparatus is generally rudimentary.\r\n\r\n(408/3. In March 1869 Darwin wrote to Mr. Wallace: \"I shall be intensely\r\ncurious to read the \"Quarterly.\" I hope you have not murdered too\r\ncompletely your own and my child.\" The reference is to Mr. Wallace's\r\nreview, in the April number of the \"Quarterly,\" of Lyell's \"Principles\r\nof Geology\" (tenth edition), and of the sixth edition of the \"Elements\r\nof Geology.\" Mr. Wallace points out that here for the first time Sir C.\r\nLyell gave up his opposition to evolution; and this leads Mr. Wallace to\r\ngive a short account of the views set forth in the \"Origin of Species.\"\r\nIn this article Mr. Wallace makes a definite statement as to his views\r\non the evolution of man, which were opposed to those of Mr. Darwin. He\r\nupholds the view that the brain of man, as well as the organs of speech,\r\nthe hand and the external form, could not have been evolved by Natural\r\nSelection (the child he is supposed to murder). At page 391 he writes:\r\n\"In the brain of the lowest savages, and, as far as we know, of the\r\nprehistoric races, we have an organ...little inferior in size and\r\ncomplexity to that of the highest types...But the mental requirements\r\nof the lowest savages, such as the Australians or the Andaman Islanders,\r\nare very little above those of many animals...How, then, was an organ\r\ndeveloped so far beyond the needs of its possessor? Natural Selection\r\ncould only have endowed the savage with a brain a little superior\r\nto that of an ape, whereas he actually possesses one but very little\r\ninferior to that of the average members of our learned societies.\" This\r\npassage is marked in Mr. Darwin's copy with a triply underlined \"No,\"\r\nand with a shower of notes of exclamation. It was probably the first\r\noccasion on which he realised the extent of this great and striking\r\ndivergence in opinion between himself and his colleague.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, some indication of it in Wallace's paper on Man,\r\n\"Anthropological Review,\" 1864. (See Letter 406). He wrote to Lyell,\r\nMay 4th, 1869, \"I was dreadfully disappointed about Man; it seems to me\r\nincredibly strange.\" And to Mr. Wallace, April 14th, 1869, \"If you had\r\nnot told me, I should have thought that [your remarks on Man] had been\r\nadded by some one else. As you expected, I differ grievously from you,\r\nand I am very sorry for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 409. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, Thursday, February 21st [1868-70?].\r\n\r\nI received the Jermyn Street programme, but have hardly yet considered\r\nit, for I was all day on the sofa on Tuesday and Wednesday. Bad though\r\nI was, I thought with constant pleasure of your very great kindness in\r\noffering to read the proofs of my essay on man. I do not know whether\r\nI said anything which might have appeared like a hint, but I assure you\r\nthat such a thought had never even momentarily passed through my mind.\r\nYour offer has just made all the difference, that I can now write,\r\nwhether or no my essay is ever printed, with a feeling of satisfaction\r\ninstead of vague dread.\r\n\r\nBeg my colleague, Mrs. Huxley, not to forget the corrugator supercilii:\r\nit will not be easy to catch the exact moment when the child is on the\r\npoint of crying, and is struggling against the wrinkling up [of] its\r\nlittle eyes; for then I should expect the corrugator, from being little\r\nunder the command of the will, would come into play in checking or\r\nstopping the wrinkling. An explosion of tears would tell nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 410. TO FRANCIS GALTON. Down, December 23rd [1870?].\r\n\r\nI have only read about fifty pages of your book (to the Judges) (410/1.\r\n\"Hereditary Genius: an Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences,\" by\r\nFrancis Galton, London, 1869. \"The Judges of England between 1660 and\r\n1865\" is the heading of a section of this work (page 55). See \"Descent\r\nof Man\" (1901), page 41.), but I must exhale myself, else something\r\nwill go wrong in my inside. I do not think I ever in all my life read\r\nanything more interesting and original. And how well and clearly you\r\nput every point! George, who has finished the book, and who expressed\r\nhimself just in the same terms, tells me the earlier chapters are\r\nnothing in interest to the later ones! It will take me some time to get\r\nto these later chapters, as it is read aloud to me by my wife, who is\r\nalso much interested. You have made a convert of an opponent in one\r\nsense, for I have always maintained that, excepting fools, men did not\r\ndiffer much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work; and I still think\r\n[this] is an eminently important difference. I congratulate you on\r\nproducing what I am convinced will prove a memorable work. I look\r\nforward with intense interest to each reading, but it sets me thinking\r\nso much that I find it very hard work; but that is wholly the fault of\r\nmy brain, and not of your beautifully clear style.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 411. TO W.R. GREG. March 21st [1871?].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your note. I am very glad indeed to read remarks made by\r\na man who possesses such varied and odd knowledge as you do, and who is\r\nso acute a reasoner. I have no doubt that you will detect blunders of\r\nmany kinds in my book. (411/1. \"The Descent of Man.\") Your MS. on the\r\nproportion of the sexes at birth seems to me extremely curious, and I\r\nhope that some day you will publish it. It certainly appears that the\r\nmales are decreasing in the London districts, and a most strange fact\r\nit is. Mr. Graham, however, I observe in a note enclosed, does not seem\r\ninclined to admit your conclusion. I have never much considered the\r\nsubject of the causes of the proportion. When I reflected on queen\r\nbees producing only males when not impregnated, whilst some other\r\nparthenogenetic insects produced, as far as known, only females, the\r\nsubject seemed to me hopelessly obscure. It is, however, pretty clear\r\nthat you have taken the one path for its solution. I wished only to\r\nascertain how far with various animals the males exceeded the females,\r\nand I have given all the facts which I could collect. As far as I\r\nknow, no other data have been published. The equality of the sexes with\r\nrace-horses is surprising. My remarks on mankind are quite superficial,\r\nand given merely as some sort of standard for comparison with the lower\r\nanimals. M. Thury is the writer who makes the sex depend on the period\r\nof impregnation. His pamphlet was sent me from Geneva. (411/2. \"Memoire\r\nsur la loi de Production des Sexes,\" 2nd edition, 1863 (a pamphlet\r\npublished by Cherbuliez, Geneva).) I can lend it you if you like. I\r\nsubsequently read an account of experiments which convinced me that\r\nM. Thury was in error; but I cannot remember what they were, only the\r\nimpression that I might safely banish this view from my mind. Your\r\nremarks on the less ratio of males in illegitimate births strikes me\r\nas the most doubtful point in your MS.--requiring two assumptions, viz.\r\nthat the fathers in such cases are relatively too young, and that the\r\nresult is the same as when the father is relatively too old.\r\n\r\nMy son, George, who is a mathematician, and who read your MS. with much\r\ninterest, has suggested, as telling in the right direction, but whether\r\nsufficient is another question, that many more illegitimate children\r\nare murdered and concealed shortly after birth, than in the case of\r\nlegitimate children; and as many more males than females die during the\r\nfirst few days of life, the census of illegitimate children practically\r\napplies to an older age than with legitimate children, and would thus\r\nslightly reduce the excess of males. This might possibly be worth\r\nconsideration. By a strange coincidence a stranger writes to me this\r\nday, making the very same suggestion.\r\n\r\nI am quite delighted to hear that my book interests you enough to lead\r\nyou to read it with some care.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 412. TO FRANCIS GALTON. Down, January 4th, 1873.\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for \"Fraser\" (412/1. \"Hereditary Improvement,\" by\r\nFrancis Galton, \"Fraser's Magazine,\" January 1873, page 116.): I have\r\nbeen greatly interested by your article. The idea of castes being\r\nspontaneously formed and leading to intermarriage (412/2. \"My object is\r\nto build up, by the mere process of extensive enquiry and publication of\r\nresults, a sentiment of caste among those who are naturally gifted,\r\nand to procure for them, before the system has fairly taken root, such\r\nmoderate social favours and preference, no more no less, as would seem\r\nreasonable to those who were justly informed of the precise measure of\r\ntheir importance to the nation\" (loc. cit., page 123).) is quite new\r\nto me, and I should suppose to others. I am not, however, so hopeful\r\nas you. Your proposed Society (412/3. Mr. Galton proposes that \"Some\r\nsociety should undertake three scientific services: the first, by\r\nmeans of a moderate number of influential local agencies, to institute\r\ncontinuous enquiries into the facts of human heredity; the second to be\r\na centre of information on heredity for breeders of animals and plants;\r\nand the third to discuss and classify the facts that were collected\"\r\n(loc. cit., page 124).) would have awfully laborious work, and I doubt\r\nwhether you could ever get efficient workers. As it is, there is much\r\nconcealment of insanity and wickedness in families; and there would\r\nbe more if there was a register. But the greatest difficulty, I think,\r\nwould be in deciding who deserved to be on the register. How few are\r\nabove mediocrity in health, strength, morals and intellect; and how\r\ndifficult to judge on these latter heads. As far as I see, within the\r\nsame large superior family, only a few of the children would deserve\r\nto be on the register; and these would naturally stick to their own\r\nfamilies, so that the superior children of distinct families would have\r\nno good chance of associating much and forming a caste. Though I see so\r\nmuch difficulty, the object seems a grand one; and you have pointed out\r\nthe sole feasible, yet I fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving\r\nthe human race. I should be inclined to trust more (and this is part\r\nof your plan) to disseminating and insisting on the importance of the\r\nall-important principle of inheritance. I will make one or two minor\r\ncriticisms. Is it not possible that the inhabitants of malarious\r\ncountries owe their degraded and miserable appearance to the bad\r\natmosphere, though this does not kill them, rather than to \"economy of\r\nstructure\"? I do not see that an orthognathous face would cost more\r\nthan a prognathous face; or a good morale than a bad one. That is a fine\r\nsimile (page 119) about the chip of a statue (412/4. \"...The life of the\r\nindividual is treated as of absolutely no importance, while the race is\r\nas everything; Nature being wholly careless of the former except as a\r\ncontributor to the maintenance and evolution of the latter. Myriads\r\nof inchoate lives are produced in what, to our best judgment, seems a\r\nwasteful and reckless manner, in order that a few selected specimens\r\nmay survive, and be the parents of the next generation. It is as though\r\nindividual lives were of no more consideration than are the senseless\r\nchips which fall from the chisel of the artist who is elaborating some\r\nideal form from a rude block\" (loc. cit., page 119).); but surely Nature\r\ndoes not more carefully regard races than individuals, as (I believe I\r\nhave misunderstood what you mean) evidenced by the multitude of races\r\nand species which have become extinct. Would it not be truer to say that\r\nNature cares only for the superior individuals and then makes her new\r\nand better races? But we ought both to shudder in using so freely the\r\nword \"Nature\" (412/5. See Letter 190, Volume I.) after what De Candolle\r\nhas said. Again let me thank you for the interest received in reading\r\nyour essay.\r\n\r\nMany thanks about the rabbits; your letter has been sent to Balfour:\r\nhe is a very clever young man, and I believe owes his cleverness to\r\nSalisbury blood. This letter will not be worth your deciphering. I have\r\nalmost finished Greg's \"Enigmas.\" (412/6. \"The Enigmas of Life,\" 1872.)\r\nIt is grand poetry--but too Utopian and too full of faith for me; so\r\nthat I have been rather disappointed. What do you think about it? He\r\nmust be a delightful man.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether you have made clear how the families on the Register are\r\nto be kept pure or superior, and how they are to be in course of time\r\nstill further improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 413. TO MAX MULLER. Down, July 3rd, 1873.\r\n\r\n(413/1. In June, 1873, Professor Max Muller sent to Mr. Darwin a copy of\r\nthe sixth edition of his \"Lectures on the Science of Language\" (413/2.\r\nA reference to the first edition occurs in \"Life and Letters,\" II., page\r\n390.), with a letter concluding with these words: \"I venture to send\r\nyou my three lectures, trusting that, though I differ from some of your\r\nconclusions, you will believe me to be one of your diligent readers and\r\nsincere admirers.\")\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your kind note and present of your lectures. I\r\nam extremely glad to have received them from you, and I had intended\r\nordering them.\r\n\r\nI feel quite sure from what I have read in your works that you would\r\nnever say anything of an honest adversary to which he would have any\r\njust right to object; and as for myself, you have often spoken highly of\r\nme--perhaps more highly than I deserve.\r\n\r\nAs far as language is concerned I am not worthy to be your adversary, as\r\nI know extremely little about it, and that little learnt from very few\r\nbooks. I should have been glad to have avoided the whole subject,\r\nbut was compelled to take it up as well as I could. He who is fully\r\nconvinced, as I am, that man is descended from some lower animal, is\r\nalmost forced to believe a priori that articulate language has been\r\ndeveloped from inarticulate cries (413/3. \"Descent of Man\" (1901), page\r\n133.); and he is therefore hardly a fair judge of the arguments opposed\r\nto this belief.\r\n\r\n(413/4. In October, 1875, Mr. Darwin again wrote cordially to Professor\r\nMax Muller on receipt of a pamphlet entitled \"In Self-Defence\" (413/5.\r\nPrinted in \"Chips from a German Workshop,\" Volume IV., 1875, page 473.),\r\nwhich is a reply to Professor Whitney's \"Darwinism and Language\" in the\r\n\"North American Review,\" July 1874. This essay had been brought before\r\nthe \"general reader\" in England by an article of Mr. G. Darwin's in the\r\n\"Contemporary Review,\" November, 1874, page 894, entitled, \"Professor\r\nWhitney on the Origin of Language.\" The article was followed by\r\n\"My reply to Mr. Darwin,\" contributed by Professor Muller to the\r\n\"Contemporary Review,\" January, 1875, page 305.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 414. G. ROLLESTON TO CHARLES DARWIN. British Association,\r\nBristol, August 30th, 1875.\r\n\r\n(414/1. In the first edition of the \"Descent of Man\" Mr. Darwin wrote:\r\n\"It is a more curious fact that savages did not formerly waste away, as\r\nMr. Bagehot has remarked, before the classical nations, as they now\r\ndo before modern civilised nations...\"(414/2. Bagehot, \"Physics and\r\nPolitics,\" \"Fortnightly Review,\" April, 1868, page 455.) In the second\r\nedition (page 183) the statement remains, but a mass of evidence\r\n(pages 183-92) is added, to which reference occurs in the reply to the\r\nfollowing letter.)\r\n\r\nAt pages 4-5 of the enclosed Address (414/3. \"British Association\r\nReports,\" 1875, page 142.) you will find that I have controverted Mr.\r\nBagehot's view as to the extinction of the barbarians in the times of\r\nclassical antiquity, as also the view of Poppig as to there being\r\nsome occult influence exercised by civilisation to the disadvantage of\r\nsavagery when the two come into contact.\r\n\r\nI write to say that I took up this subject without any wish to impugn\r\nany views of yours as such, but with the desire of having my say upon\r\ncertain anti-sanitarian transactions and malfeasance of which I had had\r\na painful experience.\r\n\r\nOn reading however what I said, and had written somewhat hastily, it has\r\nstruck me that what I have said might bear the former interpretation in\r\nthe eyes of persons who might not read other papers of mine, and indeed\r\nother parts of the same Address, in which my adhesion, whatever it\r\nis worth, to your views in general is plainly enough implied. I have\r\nventured to write this explanation to you for several reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 415. TO G. ROLLESTON. Bassett, Southampton, September 2nd [1875].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you for having sent me your Address, which has\r\ninterested me greatly. I quite subscribe to what you say about Mr.\r\nBagehot's striking remark, and wish I had not quoted it. I can perceive\r\nno sort of reflection or blame on anything which I have written, and I\r\nknow well that I deserve many a good slap on the face. The decrease of\r\nsavage populations interests me much, and I should like you some time\r\nto look at a discussion on this subject which I have introduced in the\r\nsecond edition of the \"Descent of Man,\" and which you can find (for I\r\nhave no copy here) in the list of additions. The facts have convinced me\r\nthat lessened fertility and the poor constitution of the children is one\r\nchief cause of such decrease; and that the case is strictly parallel to\r\nthe sterility of many wild animals when made captive, the civilisation\r\nof savages and the captivity of wild animals leading to the same result.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 416. TO ERNST KRAUSE. Down, June 30th, 1877.\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by your able argument against the belief\r\nthat the sense of colour has been recently acquired by man. (416/1.\r\nSee \"Kosmos,\" June 1877, page 264, a review of Dr. Hugo Magnus' \"Die\r\nGeschichtliche Entwickelung des Farbensinnes,\" 1877. The first part is\r\nchiefly an account of the author's views; Dr. Krause's argument begins\r\nat page 269. The interest felt by Mr. Darwin is recorded by the numerous\r\npencil-marks on the margin of his copy.) The following observation bears\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nI attended carefully to the mental development of my young children, and\r\nwith two, or as I believe three of them, soon after they had come to the\r\nage when they knew the names of all common objects, I was startled by\r\nobserving that they seemed quite incapable of affixing the right names\r\nto the colours in coloured engravings, although I tried repeatedly to\r\nteach them. I distinctly remember declaring that they were colour-blind,\r\nbut this afterwards proved a groundless fear.\r\n\r\nOn communicating this fact to another person he told me that he had\r\nobserved a nearly similar case. Therefore the difficulty which young\r\nchildren experience either in distinguishing, or more probably in naming\r\ncolours, seems to deserve further investigation. I will add that it\r\nformerly appeared to me that the gustatory sense, at least in the\r\ncase of my own infants, and very young children, differed from that of\r\ngrown-up persons. This was shown by their not disliking rhubarb mixed\r\nwith a little sugar and milk, which is to us abominably nauseous; and\r\nin their strong taste for the sourest and most austere fruits, such as\r\nunripe gooseberries and crabapples.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: G.J. ROMANES, 1891. Elliott & Fry, photo. Walker and Cockerell,\r\nph. sc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 417. TO G.J. ROMANES. [Barlaston], August 20th, 1878.\r\n\r\n(417/1. Part of this letter (here omitted) is published in \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., page 225, and the whole in the \"Life and Letters of G.J.\r\nRomanes,\" page 74. The lecture referred to was on animal intelligence,\r\nand was given at the Dublin meeting of the British Association.)\r\n\r\n...The sole fault which I find with your lecture is that it is too\r\nshort, and this is a rare fault. It strikes me as admirably clear and\r\ninteresting. I meant to have remonstrated that you had not discussed\r\nsufficiently the necessity of signs for the formation of abstract ideas\r\nof any complexity, and then I came on the discussion on deaf mutes. This\r\nlatter seems to me one of the richest of all the mines, and is worth\r\nworking carefully for years, and very deeply. I should like to read\r\nwhole chapters on this one head, and others on the minds of the higher\r\nidiots. Nothing can be better, as it seems to me, than your several\r\nlines or sources of evidence, and the manner in which you have arranged\r\nthe whole subject. Your book will assuredly be worth years of hard\r\nlabour; and stick to your subject. By the way, I was pleased at your\r\ndiscussing the selection of varying instincts or mental tendencies;\r\nfor I have often been disappointed by no one having ever noticed this\r\nnotion.\r\n\r\nI have just finished \"La Psychologie, son Present et son Avenir,\"\r\n1876, by Delboeuf (a mathematician and physicist of Belgium) in about a\r\nhundred pages. It has interested me a good deal, but why I hardly know;\r\nit is rather like Herbert Spencer. If you do not know it, and would care\r\nto see it, send me a postcard.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven, we return home on Thursday, and I shall be able to go on\r\nwith my humdrum work, and that makes me forget my daily discomfort.\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought of keeping a young monkey, so as to observe its\r\nmind? At a house where we have been staying there were Sir A. and Lady\r\nHobhouse, not long ago returned from India, and she and he kept [a]\r\nyoung monkey and told me some curious particulars. One was that her\r\nmonkey was very fond of looking through her eyeglass at objects, and\r\nmoved the glass nearer and further so as to vary the focus. This struck\r\nme, as Frank's son, nearly two years old (and we think much of his\r\nintellect!!) is very fond of looking through my pocket lens, and I have\r\nquite in vain endeavoured to teach him not to put the glass close down\r\non the object, but he always will do so. Therefore I conclude that a\r\nchild under two years is inferior in intellect to a monkey.\r\n\r\nOnce again I heartily congratulate you on your well-earned present, and\r\nI feel assured, grand future success.\r\n\r\n(417/2. Later in the year Mr. Darwin wrote: \"I am delighted to hear that\r\nyou mean to work the comparative Psychology well. I thought your letter\r\nto the \"Times\" very good indeed. (417/3. Romanes wrote to the \"Times\"\r\nAugust 28th, 1878, expressing his views regarding the distinction\r\nbetween man and the lower animals, in reply to criticisms contained in\r\na leading article in the \"Times\" of August 23rd on his lecture at the\r\nDublin meeting of the British Association.) Bartlett, at the Zoological\r\nGardens, I feel sure, would advise you infinitely better about\r\nhardiness, intellect, price, etc., of monkey than F. Buckland; but with\r\nhim it must be viva voce.\r\n\r\n\"Frank says you ought to keep a idiot, a deaf mute, a monkey, and a baby\r\nin your house.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 418. TO G.A. GASKELL. Down, November 15th, 1878.\r\n\r\n(418/1. This letter has been published in Clapperton's \"Scientific\r\nMeliorism,\" 1885, page 340, together with Mr. Gaskell's letter of\r\nNovember 13th (page 337). Mr. Gaskell's laws are given in his letter of\r\nNovember 13th, 1878. They are:--\r\n\r\n     I.  The Organological Law:\r\n           Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest.\r\n\r\n     II.  The Sociological Law:\r\n            Sympathetic Selection, or Indiscriminate Survival.\r\n\r\n     III.  The Moral Law:\r\n             Social Selection, or the Birth of the Fittest.)\r\n\r\nYour letter seems to me very interesting and clearly expressed, and I\r\nhope that you are in the right. Your second law appears to be largely\r\nacted on in all civilised countries, and I just alluded to it in my\r\nremarks to the effect (as far as I remember) that the evil which would\r\nfollow by checking benevolence and sympathy in not fostering the weak\r\nand diseased would be greater than by allowing them to survive and then\r\nto procreate.\r\n\r\nWith regard to your third law, I do not know whether you have read an\r\narticle (I forget when published) by F. Galton, in which he proposes\r\ncertificates of health, etc., for marriage, and that the best should be\r\nmatched. I have lately been led to reflect a little, (for, now that I\r\nam growing old, my work has become [word indecipherable] special) on the\r\nartificial checks, but doubt greatly whether such would be advantageous\r\nto the world at large at present, however it may be in the distant\r\nfuture. Suppose that such checks had been in action during the last\r\ntwo or three centuries, or even for a shorter time in Britain, what a\r\ndifference it would have made in the world, when we consider America,\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, and S. Africa! No words can exaggerate the\r\nimportance, in my opinion, of our colonisation for the future history of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIf it were universally known that the birth of children could be\r\nprevented, and this were not thought immoral by married persons, would\r\nthere not be great danger of extreme profligacy amongst unmarried women,\r\nand might we not become like the \"arreoi\" societies in the Pacific? In\r\nthe course of a century France will tell us the result in many ways, and\r\nwe can already see that the French nation does not spread or increase\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you intend to continue your investigations, and I hope\r\nultimately may publish on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 419. TO K. HOCHBERG. Down, January 13th, 1879.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your note and for the essay which you have sent\r\nme. I am a poor german scholar, and your german is difficult; but I\r\nthink that I understand your meaning, and hope at some future time, when\r\nmore at leisure, to recur to your essay. As far as I can judge, you have\r\nmade a great advance in many ways in the subject; and I will send your\r\npaper to Mr. Edmund Gurney (The late Edmund Gurney, author of \"The Power\r\nof Sound,\" 1880.), who has written on and is much interested in the\r\norigin of the taste for music. In reading your essay, it occurred to me\r\nthat facility in the utterance of prolonged sounds (I do not think that\r\nyou allude to this point) may possibly come into play in rendering them\r\nmusical; for I have heard it stated that those who vary their voices\r\nmuch, and use cadences in long continued speaking, feel less fatigued\r\nthan those who speak on the same note.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 420. TO G.J. ROMANES. Down, February 5th, 1880.\r\n\r\n(420/1. Romanes was at work on what ultimately came to be a book on\r\nanimal intelligence. Romanes's reply to this letter is given in his\r\n\"Life,\" page 95. The table referred to is published as a frontispiece to\r\nhis \"Mental Evolution in Animals,\" 1885.)\r\n\r\nAs I feared, I cannot be of the least use to you. I could not venture to\r\nsay anything about babies without reading my Expression book and paper\r\non Infants, or about animals without reading the \"Descent of Man\" and\r\nreferring to my notes; and it is a great wrench to my mind to change\r\nfrom one subject to another.\r\n\r\nI will, however, hazard one or two remarks. Firstly, I should have\r\nthought that the word \"love\" (not sexual passion), as shown very low in\r\nthe scale, to offspring and apparently to comrades, ought to have come\r\nin more prominently in your table than appears to be the case. Secondly,\r\nif you give any instance of the appreciation of different stimulants by\r\nplants, there is a much better case than that given by you--namely,\r\nthat of the glands of Drosera, which can be touched roughly two or three\r\ntimes and do not transmit any effect, but do so if pressed by a weight\r\nof 1/78000 grain (\"Insectivorous Plants\" 263). On the other hand, the\r\nfilament of Dionoea may be quietly loaded with a much greater weight,\r\nwhile a touch by a hair causes the lobes to close instantly. This has\r\nalways seemed to me a marvellous fact. Thirdly, I have been accustomed\r\nto look at the coming in of the sense of pleasure and pain as one of the\r\nmost important steps in the development of mind, and I should think it\r\nought to be prominent in your table. The sort of progress which I have\r\nimagined is that a stimulus produced some effect at the point affected,\r\nand that the effect radiated at first in all directions, and then that\r\ncertain definite advantageous lines of transmission were acquired,\r\ninducing definite reaction in certain lines. Such transmission\r\nafterwards became associated in some unknown way with pleasure or pain.\r\nThese sensations led at first to all sorts of violent action, such as\r\nthe wriggling of a worm, which was of some use. All the organs of sense\r\nwould be at the same time excited. Afterwards definite lines of action\r\nwould be found to be the most useful, and so would be practised. But it\r\nis of no use my giving you my crude notions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 421. TO S. TOLVER PRESTON. Down, May 22nd, 1880.\r\n\r\n(421/1. Mr. Preston wrote (May 20th, 1880) to the effect that\r\n\"self-interest as a motive for conduct is a thing to be commended--and\r\nit certainly [is] I think...the only conceivable rational motive of\r\nconduct: and always is the tacitly recognised motive in all rational\r\nactions.\" Mr. Preston does not, of course, commend selfishness, which is\r\nnot true self-interest.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be two ways of looking at the case given by Darwin. The\r\nman who knows that he is risking his life,--realising that the personal\r\nsatisfaction that may follow is not worth the risk--is surely admirable\r\nfrom the strength of character that leads him to follow the social\r\ninstinct against his purely personal inclination. But the man who\r\nblindly obeys the social instinct is a more useful member of a social\r\ncommunity. He will act with courage where even the strong man will\r\nfail.)\r\n\r\nYour letter appears to me an interesting and valuable one; but I have\r\nnow been working for some years exclusively on the physiology of plants,\r\nand all other subjects have gone out of my head, and it fatigues me\r\nmuch to try and bring them back again into my head. I am, moreover,\r\nat present very busy, as I leave home for a fortnight's rest at the\r\nbeginning of next week. My conviction as yet remains unchanged, that\r\na man who (for instance) jumps into a river to save a life without a\r\nsecond's reflection (either from an innate tendency or from one gained\r\nby habit) is deservedly more honoured than a man who acts deliberately\r\nand is conscious, for however short a time, that the risk and sacrifice\r\ngive him some inward satisfaction.\r\n\r\nYou are of course familiar with Herbert Spencer's writings on Ethics.\r\n\r\n\r\n(422/1. The observations to which the following letters refer were\r\ncontinued by Mr. Wallis, who gave an account of his work in an\r\ninteresting paper in the \"Proceedings of the Zoological Society,\" March\r\n2nd, 1897. The results on the whole confirm the belief that traces of an\r\nancestral pointed ear exist in man.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 422. TO H.M. WALLIS. Down, March 22nd, 1881.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your courteous and kind note. The fact which\r\nyou communicate is quite new to me, and as I was laughed at about the\r\ntips to human ears, I should like to publish in \"Nature\" some time your\r\nfact. But I must first consult Eschricht, and see whether he notices\r\nthis fact in his curious paper on the lanugo on human embryos; and\r\nsecondly I ought to look to monkeys and other animals which have tufted\r\nears, and observe how the hair grows. This I shall not be able to do for\r\nsome months, as I shall not be in London until the autumn so as to go to\r\nthe Zoological Gardens. But in order that I may not hereafter throw away\r\ntime, will you be so kind as to inform me whether I may publish your\r\nobservation if on further search it seems desirable?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 423. TO H.M. WALLIS. Down, March 31st, 1881.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your interesting letter. I am glad to hear that\r\nyou are looking to other ears, and will visit the Zoological Gardens.\r\nUnder these circumstances it would be incomparably better (as more\r\nauthentic) if you would publish a notice of your observations in\r\n\"Nature\" or some scientific journal. Would it not be well to confine\r\nyour attention to infants, as more likely to retain any primordial\r\ncharacter, and offering less difficulty in observing. I think, though,\r\nit would be worth while to observe whether there is any relation (though\r\nprobably none) between much hairiness on the ears of an infant and\r\nthe presence of the \"tip\" on the folded margin. Could you not get an\r\naccurate sketch of the direction of the hair of the tip of an ear?\r\n\r\nThe fact which you communicate about the goat-sucker is very curious.\r\nAbout the difference in the power of flight in Dorkings, etc., may it\r\nnot be due merely to greater weight of body in the adults?\r\n\r\nI am so old that I am not likely ever again to write on general and\r\ndifficult points in the theory of Evolution.\r\n\r\nI shall use what little strength is left me for more confined and easy\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 424. TO MRS. TALBOT.\r\n\r\n(Mrs. Emily Talbot was secretary of the Education Department of the\r\nAmerican Social Science Association, Boston, Mass. A circular and\r\nregister was issued by the Department, and answers to various questions\r\nwere asked for. See \"Nature,\" April 28th, page 617, 1881. The above\r\nletter was published in \"The Field Naturalist,\" Manchester, 1883, page\r\n5, edited by Mr. W.E. Axon, to whom we are indebted for a copy.)\r\n\r\nDown, July 19th [1881?]\r\n\r\nIn response to your wish, I have much pleasure in expressing the\r\ninterest which I feel in your proposed investigation on the mental and\r\nbodily development of infants. Very little is at present accurately\r\nknown on this subject, and I believe that isolated observations will add\r\nbut little to our knowledge, whereas tabulated results from a very large\r\nnumber of observations, systematically made, would probably throw\r\nmuch light on the sequence and period of development of the several\r\nfaculties. This knowledge would probably give a foundation for some\r\nimprovement in our education of young children, and would show us\r\nwhether the system ought to be followed in all cases.\r\n\r\nI will venture to specify a few points of inquiry which, as it seems to\r\nme, possess some scientific interest. For instance, does the education\r\nof the parents influence the mental powers of their children at any\r\nage, either at a very early or somewhat more advanced stage? This could\r\nperhaps be learned by schoolmasters and mistresses if a large number\r\nof children were first classed according to age and their mental\r\nattainments, and afterwards in accordance with the education of their\r\nparents, as far as this could be discovered. As observation is one of\r\nthe earliest faculties developed in young children, and as this power\r\nwould probably be exercised in an equal degree by the children of\r\neducated and uneducated persons, it seems not impossible that any\r\ntransmitted effect from education could be displayed only at a somewhat\r\nadvanced age. It would be desirable to test statistically, in a similar\r\nmanner, the truth of the oft-repeated statement that coloured children\r\nat first learn as quickly as white children, but that they afterwards\r\nfall off in progress. If it could be proved that education acts not only\r\non the individual, but, by transmission, on the race, this would be a\r\ngreat encouragement to all working on this all-important subject. It is\r\nwell known that children sometimes exhibit, at a very early age,\r\nstrong special tastes, for which no cause can be assigned, although\r\noccasionally they may be accounted for by reversion to the taste or\r\noccupation of some progenitor; and it would be interesting to learn how\r\nfar such early tastes are persistent and influence the future career\r\nof the individual. In some instances such tastes die away without\r\napparently leaving any after effect, but it would be desirable to know\r\nhow far this is commonly the case, as we should then know whether it\r\nwere important to direct as far as this is possible the early tastes\r\nof our children. It may be more beneficial that a child should follow\r\nenergetically some pursuit, of however trifling a nature, and thus\r\nacquire perseverance, than that he should be turned from it because\r\nof no future advantage to him. I will mention one other small point of\r\ninquiry in relation to very young children, which may possibly prove\r\nimportant with respect to the origin of language; but it could be\r\ninvestigated only by persons possessing an accurate musical ear.\r\nChildren, even before they can articulate, express some of their\r\nfeelings and desires by noises uttered in different notes. For instance,\r\nthey make an interrogative noise, and others of assent and dissent,\r\nin different tones; and it would, I think, be worth while to ascertain\r\nwhether there is any uniformity in different children in the pitch of\r\ntheir voices under various frames of mind.\r\n\r\nI fear that this letter can be of no use to you, but it will serve to\r\nshow my sympathy and good wishes in your researches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.VIII.II. SEXUAL SELECTION, 1866-1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 425. TO JAMES SHAW. Down, February 11th [1866].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you for your kindness in sending me an abstract of\r\nyour paper on beauty. (425/1. A newspaper report of a communication to\r\nthe \"Dumfries Antiquarian and Natural History Society.\") In my opinion\r\nyou take quite a correct view of the subject. It is clear that Dr.\r\nDickson has either never seen my book, or overlooked the discussion\r\non sexual selection. If you have any precise facts on birds' \"courtesy\r\ntowards their own image in mirror or picture,\" I should very much like\r\nto hear them. Butterflies offer an excellent instance of beauty being\r\ndisplayed in conspicuous parts; for those kinds which habitually display\r\nthe underside of the wing have this side gaudily coloured, and this is\r\nnot so in the reverse case. I daresay you will know that the males of\r\nmany foreign butterflies are much more brilliantly coloured than the\r\nfemales, as in the case of birds. I can adduce good evidence from two\r\nlarge classes of facts (too large to specify) that flowers have become\r\nbeautiful to make them conspicuous to insects. (425/2. This letter is\r\npublished in \"A Country Schoolmaster, James Shaw.\" Edited by Robert\r\nWallace, Edinburgh, 1899.)\r\n\r\n(425/3. Mr. Darwin wrote again to Mr. Shaw in April, 1866:--)\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your kind letter and all the great trouble which\r\nyou have taken in sending to all the various and interesting facts on\r\nbirds admiring themselves. I am very glad to hear of these facts. I have\r\njust finished writing and adding to a new edition of the \"Origin,\" and\r\nin this I have given, without going into details (so that I shall not be\r\nable to use your facts), some remarks on the subject of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 426. TO A.D. BARTLETT. Down, February 16th [1867?]\r\n\r\nI want to beg two favours of you. I wish to ascertain whether the\r\nBower-Bird discriminates colours. (426/1. Mr. Bartlett does not seem to\r\nhave supplied any information on the point in question. The evidence for\r\nthe Bower-Bird's taste in colour is in \"Descent of Man,\" II., page 112.)\r\nWill you have all the coloured worsted removed from the cage and bower,\r\nand then put all in a row, at some distance from bower, the enclosed\r\ncoloured worsted, and mark whether the bird AT FIRST makes any\r\nselection. Each packet contains an equal quantity; the packets had\r\nbetter be separate, and each thread put separate, but close\r\ntogether; perhaps it would be fairest if the several colours were put\r\nalternately--one thread of bright scarlet, one thread of brown, etc.,\r\netc. There are six colours. Will you have the kindness to tell me\r\nwhether the birds prefer one colour to another?\r\n\r\nSecondly, I very much want several heads of the fancy and\r\nlong-domesticated rabbits, to measure the capacity of skull. I want\r\nonly small kinds, such as Himalaya, small Angora, Silver Grey, or any\r\nsmall-sized rabbit which has long been domesticated. The Silver Grey\r\nfrom warrens would be of little use. The animals must be adult, and the\r\nsmaller the breed the better. Now when any one dies would you send me\r\nthe carcase named; if the skin is of any value it might be skinned, but\r\nit would be rather better with skin, and I could make a present to\r\nany keeper to whom the skin is a perquisite. This would be of great\r\nassistance to me, if you would have the kindness thus to aid me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 427. TO W.B. TEGETMEIER.\r\n\r\n(427/1. We are not aware that the experiment here suggested has ever\r\nbeen carried out.)\r\n\r\nDown, March 5th [1867].\r\n\r\nI write on the bare and very improbable chance of your being able\r\nto try, or get some trustworthy person to try, the following little\r\nexperiment. But I may first state, as showing what I want, that it has\r\nbeen stated that if two long feathers in the tail of the male Widow-Bird\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope are pulled out, no female will pair with him.\r\n\r\nNow, where two or three common cocks are kept, I want to know, if the\r\ntail sickle-feathers and saddle-feathers of one which had succeeded in\r\ngetting wives were cut and mutilated and his beauty spoiled, whether he\r\nwould continue to be successful in getting wives. This might be tried\r\nwith drakes or peacocks, but no one would be willing to spoil for a\r\nseason his peacocks. I have no strength or opportunity of watching my\r\nown poultry, otherwise I would try it. I would very gladly repay all\r\nexpenses of loss of value of the poultry, etc. But, as I said, I have\r\nwritten on the most improbable chance of your interesting any one to\r\nmake the trial, or having time and inclination yourself to make it.\r\nAnother, and perhaps better, mode of making the trial would be to turn\r\ndown to some hens two or three cocks, one being injured in its plumage.\r\n\r\nI am glad to say that I have begun correcting proofs. (427/2. \"The\r\nVariation of Animals and Plants.\") I hope that you received safely the\r\nskulls which you so kindly lent me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 428. TO W.B. TEGETMEIER. Down, March 30th [1867].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your note, and shall be truly obliged if you will\r\ninsert any question on the subject. That is a capital remark of yours\r\nabout the trimmed game cocks, and shall be quoted by me. (428/1.\r\n\"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., Volume II., page 117. \"Mr. Tegetmeier is\r\nconvinced that a game cock, though disfigured by being dubbed with his\r\nhackles trimmed, would be accepted as readily as a male retaining all\r\nhis natural ornaments.\") Nevertheless I am still inclined from many\r\nfacts strongly to believe that the beauty of the male bird determines\r\nthe choice of the female with wild birds, however it may be under\r\ndomestication. Sir R. Heron has described how one pied peacock was extra\r\nattentive to the hens. This is a subject which I must take up as soon as\r\nmy present book is done.\r\n\r\nI shall be most particularly obliged to you if you will dye with magenta\r\na pigeon or two. (428/2. \"Mr. Tegetmeier, at my request, stained some\r\nof his birds with magenta, but they were not much noticed by the\r\nothers.\"--\"Descent of Man\" (1901), page 637.) Would it not be better\r\nto dye the tail alone and crown of head, so as not to make too great\r\ndifference? I shall be very curious to hear how an entirely crimson\r\npigeon will be received by the others as well as his mate.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Perhaps the best experiment, for my purpose, would be to colour a\r\nyoung unpaired male and turn him with other pigeons, and observe whether\r\nhe was longer or quicker than usual in mating.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 429. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, April 29th [1867].\r\n\r\nI have been greatly interested by your letter, but your view is not new\r\nto me. (429/1. We have not been able to find Mr. Wallace's letter to\r\nwhich this is a reply. It evidently refers to Mr. Wallace's belief in\r\nthe paramount importance of protection in the evolution of colour. This\r\nis clear from the P.S. to the present letter and from the passages in\r\nthe \"Origin\" referred to. The first reference, Edition IV., page 240,\r\nis as follows: \"We can sometimes plainly see the proximate cause of the\r\ntransmission of ornaments to the males alone; for a pea-hen with the\r\nlong tail of the male bird would be badly fitted to sit on her eggs, and\r\na coal-black female capercailzie would be far more conspicuous on her\r\nnest, and more exposed to danger, than in her present modest attire.\"\r\nThe passages in Edition I. (pages 89, 101) do not directly bear on the\r\nquestion of protection.) If you will look at page 240 of the fourth\r\nedition of the \"Origin\" you will find it very briefly given with\r\ntwo extreme examples of the peacock and black grouse. A more general\r\nstatement is given at page 101, or at page 89 of the first edition,\r\nfor I have long entertained this view, though I have never had space to\r\ndevelop it. But I had not sufficient knowledge to generalise as far as\r\nyou do about colouring and nesting. In your paper perhaps you will just\r\nallude to my scanty remark in the fourth edition, because in my Essay\r\non Man I intend to discuss the whole subject of sexual selection,\r\nexplaining as I believe it does much with respect to man. I have\r\ncollected all my old notes, and partly written my discussion, and it\r\nwould be flat work for me to give the leading idea as exclusively from\r\nyou. But, as I am sure from your greater knowledge of Ornithology and\r\nEntomology that you will write a much better discussion than I could,\r\nyour paper will be of great use to me. Nevertheless I must discuss the\r\nsubject fully in my Essay on Man. When we met at the Zoological Society,\r\nand I asked you about the sexual differences in kingfishers, I had this\r\nsubject in view; as I had when I suggested to Bates the difficulty about\r\ngaudy caterpillars, which you have so admirably (as I believe it will\r\nprove) explained. (429/2. See a letter of February 26th, 1867, to Mr.\r\nWallace, \"Life and Letters\" III., page 94.) I have got one capital case\r\n(genus forgotten) of a [Australian] bird in which the female has long\r\ntail-plumes, and which consequently builds a different nest from all her\r\nallies. (429/3. Menura superba: see \"Descent of Man\" (1901), page 687.\r\nRhynchoea, mentioned a line or two lower down, is discussed in the\r\n\"Descent,\" page 727. The female is more brightly coloured than the male,\r\nand has a convoluted trachea, elsewhere a masculine character. There\r\nseems some reason to suppose that \"the male undertakes the duty of\r\nincubation.\") With respect to certain female birds being more brightly\r\ncoloured than the males, and the latter incubating, I have gone a little\r\ninto the subject, and cannot say that I am fully satisfied. I remember\r\nmentioning to you the case of Rhynchoea, but its nesting seems unknown.\r\nIn some other cases the difference in brightness seemed to me hardly\r\nsufficiently accounted for by the principle of protection. At the\r\nFalkland Islands there is a carrion hawk in which the female (as I\r\nascertained by dissection) is the brightest coloured, and I doubt\r\nwhether protection will here apply; but I wrote several months ago to\r\nthe Falklands to make enquiries. The conclusion to which I have been\r\nleaning is that in some of these abnormal cases the colour happened to\r\nvary in the female alone, and was transmitted to females alone, and that\r\nher variations have been selected through the admiration of the male.\r\n\r\nIt is a very interesting subject, but I shall not be able to go on with\r\nit for the next five or six months, as I am fully employed in correcting\r\ndull proof-sheets. When I return to the work I shall find it much better\r\ndone by you than I could have succeeded in doing.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how we hit on the same ideas. I have endeavoured to show\r\nin my MS. discussion that nearly the same principles account for young\r\nbirds not being gaily coloured in many cases, but this is too complex a\r\npoint for a note.\r\n\r\nOn reading over your letter again, and on further reflection, I do not\r\nthink (as far as I remember my words) that I expressed myself nearly\r\nstrongly enough on the value and beauty of your generalisation (429/4.\r\nSee Letter 203, Volume I.), viz., that all birds in which the female\r\nis conspicuously or brightly coloured build in holes or under domes. I\r\nthought that this was the explanation in many, perhaps most cases, but\r\ndo not think I should ever have extended my view to your generalisation.\r\nForgive me troubling you with this P.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 430. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, May 5th [1867].\r\n\r\nThe offer of your valuable notes is most generous, but it would vex me\r\nto take so much from you, as it is certain that you could work up\r\nthe subject very much better than I could. Therefore I earnestly, and\r\nwithout any reservation, hope that you will proceed with your paper, so\r\nthat I return your notes. You seem already to have well investigated the\r\nsubject. I confess on receiving your note that I felt rather flat at my\r\nrecent work being almost thrown away, but I did not intend to show this\r\nfeeling. As a proof how little advance I had made on the subject, I may\r\nmention that though I had been collecting facts on the colouring, and\r\nother sexual differences in mammals, your explanation with respect to\r\nthe females had not occurred to me. I am surprised at my own stupidity,\r\nbut I have long recognised how much clearer and deeper your insight into\r\nmatters is than mine. I do not know how far you have attended to the\r\nlaws of inheritance, so what follows may be obvious to you. I have begun\r\nmy discussion on sexual selection by showing that new characters often\r\nappear in one sex and are transmitted to that sex alone, and that from\r\nsome unknown cause such characters apparently appear oftener in the\r\nmale than in the female. Secondly, characters may be developed and be\r\nconfined to the male, and long afterwards be transferred to the female.\r\nThirdly, characters may arise in either sex and be transmitted to both\r\nsexes, either in an equal or unequal degree. In this latter case I have\r\nsupposed that the survival of the fittest has come into play with female\r\nbirds and kept the female dull-coloured. With respect to the absence of\r\nspurs in the female gallinaceous birds, I presume that they would be\r\nin the way during incubation; at least I have got the case of a German\r\nbreed of fowls in which the hens were spurred, and were found to disturb\r\nand break their eggs much. With respect to the females of deer not\r\nhaving horns, I presume it is to save the loss of organised matter. In\r\nyour note you speak of sexual selection and protection as sufficient to\r\naccount for the colouring of all animals, but it seems to me doubtful\r\nhow far this will come into play with some of the lower animals, such as\r\nsea anemones, some corals, etc., etc. On the other hand Hackel (430/1.\r\nSee \"Descent of Man\" (1901) page 402.) has recently well shown that\r\nthe transparency and absence of colour in the lower oceanic animals,\r\nbelonging to the most different classes, may be well accounted for on\r\nthe principle of protection.\r\n\r\nSome time or other I should like much to know where your paper on the\r\nnests of birds has appeared, and I shall be extremely anxious to read\r\nyour paper in the \"Westminster Review.\" (430/2. \"Westminster Review,\"\r\nJuly, 1867.) Your paper on the sexual colouring of birds will, I have\r\nno doubt, be very striking. Forgive me, if you can, for a touch of\r\nilliberality about your paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 431. TO A.R. WALLACE. March 19th, 1868.\r\n\r\n(431/1. \"The Variation of Animals and Plants\" having been published on\r\nJanuary 30th, 1868, Mr. Darwin notes in his diary that on February 4th\r\nhe \"Began on Man and Sexual Selection.\" He had already (in 1864 and\r\n1867) corresponded with Mr. Wallace on these questions--see for\r\ninstance the \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 89; but, owing to various\r\ninterruptions, serious work on the subject did not begin until 1869. The\r\nfollowing quotations show the line of work undertaken early in 1868.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace wrote (March 19th, 1868): \"I am glad you have got good\r\nmaterials on sexual selection. It is no doubt a difficult subject.\r\nOne difficulty to me is, that I do not see how the constant MINUTE\r\nvariations, which are sufficient for Natural Selection to work with,\r\ncould be SEXUALLY selected. We seem to require a series of bold and\r\nabrupt variations. How can we imagine that an inch in the tail of the\r\npeacock, or 1/4-inch in that of the Bird of Paradise, would be noticed\r\nand preferred by the female.\")\r\n\r\nIn regard to sexual selection. A girl sees a handsome man, and without\r\nobserving whether his nose or whiskers are the tenth of an inch longer\r\nor shorter than in some other man, admires his appearance and says she\r\nwill marry him. So, I suppose, with the pea-hen; and the tail has been\r\nincreased in length merely by, on the whole, presenting a more gorgeous\r\nappearance. J. Jenner Weir, however, has given me some facts showing\r\nthat birds apparently admire details of plumage.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 432. TO F. MULLER. March 28th [1868].\r\n\r\nI am particularly obliged to you for your observations on the\r\nstridulation of the two sexes of Lamellicorns. (432/1. We are unable\r\nto find any mention of F. Muller's observations on this point; but\r\nthe reference is clearly to Darwin's observations on Necrophorus and\r\nPelobius, in which the stridulating rasp was bigger in the males in the\r\nfirst individuals examined, but not so in succeeding specimens. \"Descent\r\nof Man,\" Edition II., Volume I., page 382.) I begin to fear that I am\r\ncompletely in error owing to that common cause, viz. mistaking at first\r\nindividual variability for sexual difference.\r\n\r\nI go on working at sexual selection, and, though never idle, I am able\r\nto do so little work each day that I make very slow progress. I knew\r\nfrom Azara about the young of the tapir being striped, and about young\r\ndeer being spotted (432/2. Fritz Muller's views are discussed in the\r\n\"Descent of Man,\" Edition II., Volume II., page 305.); I have often\r\nreflected on this subject, and know not what to conclude about the loss\r\nof the stripes and spots. From the geographical distribution of the\r\nstriped and unstriped species of Equus there seems to be something very\r\nmysterious about the loss of stripes; and I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat the common ass has lost its stripes owing to being rendered more\r\nconspicuous from having stripes and thus exposed to danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 433. TO J. JENNER WEIR.\r\n\r\n(433/1. Mr. John Jenner Weir, to whom the following letters are\r\naddressed, is frequently quoted in the \"Descent of Man\" as having\r\nsupplied Mr. Darwin with information on a variety of subjects.)\r\n\r\nDown, February 27th [1868].\r\n\r\nI must thank you for your paper on apterous lepidoptera (433/2.\r\nPublished by the West Kent Natural History, Microscopical and\r\nPhotographic Society, Greenwich, 1867. Mr. Weir's paper seems chiefly to\r\nhave interested Mr. Darwin as affording a good case of gradation in\r\nthe degree of degradation of the wings in various species.), which has\r\ninterested me exceedingly, and likewise for the very honourable mention\r\nwhich you make of my name. It is almost a pity that your paper was\r\nnot published in some Journal in which it would have had a wider\r\ndistribution. It contained much that was new to me. I think the part\r\nabout the relation of the wings and spiracles and tracheae might have\r\nbeen made a little clearer. Incidentally, you have done me a good\r\nservice by reminding me of the rudimentary spurs on the legs of the\r\npartridge, for I am now writing on what I have called sexual selection.\r\nI believe that I am not mistaken in thinking that you have attended much\r\nto birds in confinement, as well as to insects. If you could call to\r\nmind any facts bearing on this subject, with birds, insects, or any\r\nanimals--such as the selection by a female of any particular male--or\r\nconversely of a particular female by a male, or on the rivalry between\r\nmales, or on the allurement of the females by the males, or any such\r\nfacts, I should be most grateful for the information, if you would have\r\nthe kindness to communicate it.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I may give as instance of [this] class of facts, that Barrow\r\nasserts that a male Emberiza (?) at the Cape has immensely long\r\ntail-feathers during the breeding season (433/3. Barrow describes the\r\nlong tail feathers of Emberiza longicauda as enduring \"but the season\r\nof love.\" \"An Account of Travels into the Interior of Southern Africa\":\r\nLondon, 1801, Volume I., page 244.); and that if these are cut off, he\r\nhas no chance of getting a wife. I have always felt an intense wish to\r\nmake analogous trials, but have never had an opportunity, and it is not\r\nlikely that you or any one would be willing to try so troublesome an\r\nexperiment. Colouring or staining the fine red breast of a bullfinch\r\nwith some innocuous matter into a dingy tint would be an analogous\r\ncase, and then putting him and ordinary males with a female. A\r\nfriend promised, but failed, to try a converse experiment with white\r\npigeons--viz., to stain their tails and wings with magenta or other\r\ncolours, and then observe what effect such a prodigious alteration would\r\nhave on their courtship. (433/4. See Letter 428.) It would be a fairer\r\ntrial to cut off the eyes of the tail-feathers of male peacocks; but who\r\nwould sacrifice the beauty of their bird for a whole season to please a\r\nmere naturalist?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 434. TO J. JENNER WEIR. Down, February 29th [1868].\r\n\r\nI have hardly ever received a note which has interested me more than\r\nyour last; and this is no exaggeration. I had a few cases of birds\r\nperceiving slight changes in the dress of their owners, but your facts\r\nare of tenfold value. I shall certainly make use of them, and need not\r\nsay how much obliged I should be for any others about which you feel\r\nconfident.\r\n\r\nDo you know of any birds besides some of the gallinaceae which are\r\npolygamous? Do you know of any birds besides pigeons, and, as it is\r\nsaid, the raven, which pair for their whole lives?\r\n\r\nMany years ago I visited your brother, who showed me his pigeons and\r\ngave me some valuable information. Could you persuade him (but I fear\r\nhe would think it high treason) to stain a male pigeon some brilliant\r\ncolour, and observe whether it excited in the other pigeons, especially\r\nthe females, admiration or contempt?\r\n\r\nFor the chance of your liking to have a copy and being able to find some\r\nparts which would interest you, I have directed Mr. Murray to send you\r\nmy recent book on \"Variation under Domestication.\"\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have somewhere safe references to cases of magpies, of which\r\none of a pair has been repeatedly (I think seven times) killed, and yet\r\nanother mate was always immediately found. (434/1. On this subject see\r\n\"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., Volume II., page 104, where Mr. Weir's\r\nobservations were made use of. This statement is quoted from Jenner\r\n(\"Phil. Trans.\" 1824) in the \"Descent of Man\" (1901), page 620.) A\r\ngamekeeper told me yesterday of analogous case. This perplexes me much.\r\nAre there many unmarried birds? I can hardly believe it. Or will one of\r\na pair, of which the nest has been robbed, or which are barren, always\r\ndesert his or her mate for a strange mate with the attraction of a nest,\r\nand in one instance with young birds in the nest? The gamekeeper said\r\nduring breeding season he had never observed a single or unpaired\r\npartridge. How can the sexes be so equally matched?\r\n\r\nP.S. 2nd.--I fear you will find me a great bore, but I will be as\r\nreasonable as can be expected in plundering one so rich as you.\r\n\r\nP.S. 3rd.--I have just received a letter from Dr. Wallace (434/2.\r\nSee \"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., Volume I., pages 386-401, where\r\nDr. Wallace's observations are quoted.), of Colchester, about the\r\nproportional numbers of the two sexes in Bombyx; and in this note,\r\napropos to an incidental remark of mine, he stoutly maintains that\r\nfemale lepidoptera never notice the colours or appearance of the male,\r\nbut always receive the first male which comes; and this appears very\r\nprobable. He says he has often seen fine females receive old battered\r\nand pale-tinted males. I shall have to admit this very great objection\r\nto sexual selection in insects. His observations no doubt apply to\r\nEnglish lepidoptera, in most of which the sexes are alike. The brimstone\r\nor orange-tip would be good to observe in this respect, but it is\r\nhopelessly difficult. I think I have often seen several males following\r\none female; and what decides which male shall succeed? How is this about\r\nseveral males; is it not so?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 435. TO J. JENNER WEIR. 6, Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square,\r\nW. [March 6th, 1868].\r\n\r\nI have come here for a few weeks, for a little change and rest. Just as\r\nI was leaving home I received your first note, and yesterday a second;\r\nand both are most interesting and valuable to me. That is a very curious\r\nobservation about the goldfinch's beak (435/1. \"Descent of Man,\"\r\nEdition I., Volume I., page 39. Mr. Weir is quoted as saying that the\r\nbirdcatchers can distinguish the males of the goldfinch, Carduelis\r\nelegans, by their \"slightly longer beaks.\"), but one would hardly like\r\nto trust it without measurement or comparison of the beaks of several\r\nmale and female birds; for I do not understand that you yourself assert\r\nthat the beak of the male is sensibly longer than that of the female. If\r\nyou come across any acute birdcatchers (I do not mean to ask you to\r\ngo after them), I wish you would ask what is their impression on the\r\nrelative numbers of the sexes of any birds which they habitually catch,\r\nand whether some years males are more numerous and some years females.\r\nI see that I must trust to analogy (an unsafe support) for sexual\r\nselection in regard to colour in butterflies. You speak of the brimstone\r\nbutterfly and genus Edusa (435/2. Colias Edusa.) (I forget what this is,\r\nand have no books here, unless it is Colias) not opening their wings.\r\nIn one of my notes to Mr. Stainton I asked him (but he could or did not\r\nanswer) whether butterflies such as the Fritillaries, with wings bright\r\nbeneath and above, opened and shut their wings more than Vanessae, most\r\nof which, I think, are obscure on the under surface. That is a most\r\ncurious observation about the red underwing moth and the robin (435/3.\r\n\"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., Volume I., page 395. Mr. Weir describes\r\nthe pursuit of a red-underwing, Triphoena pronuba, by a robin which was\r\nattracted by the bright colour of the moth, and constantly missed the\r\ninsect by breaking pieces off the wing instead of seizing the body. Mr.\r\nWallace's facts are given on the same page.), and strongly supports a\r\nsuggestion (which I thought hardly credible) of A.R. Wallace, viz. that\r\nthe immense wings of some exotic lepidoptera served as a protection from\r\ndifficulty of birds seizing them. I will probably quote your case.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Dr. Hooker collected the Kerguelen moth, for I remember he told\r\nme of the case when I suggested in the \"Origin,\" the explanation of\r\nthe coleoptera of Madeira being apterous; but he did not know what had\r\nbecome of the specimens.\r\n\r\nI am quite delighted to hear that you are observing coloured birds\r\n(435/4. \"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., Volume II., page 110.), though the\r\nprobability, I suppose, will be that no sure result will be gained. I am\r\naccustomed with my numerous experiments with plants to be well satisfied\r\nif I get any good result in one case out of five.\r\n\r\nYou will not be able to read all my book--too much detail. Some of the\r\nchapters in the second volume are curious, I think. If any man wants to\r\ngain a good opinion of his fellow-men, he ought to do what I am doing,\r\npester them with letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 436. TO J. JENNER WEIR. 4, Chester Place, Regent's Park, N.W.,\r\nMarch 13th [1868].\r\n\r\nYou make a very great mistake when you speak of \"the risk of your notes\r\nboring me.\" They are of the utmost value to me, and I am sure I shall\r\nnever be tired of receiving them; but I must not be unreasonable. I\r\nshall give almost all the facts which you have mentioned in your two\r\nlast notes, as well as in the previous ones; and my only difficulty\r\nwill be not to give too much and weary my readers. Your last note is\r\nespecially valuable about birds displaying the beautiful parts of their\r\nplumage. Audubon (436/1. In his \"Ornithological Biography,\" 5 volumes,\r\nEdinburgh, 1831-49.) gives a good many facts about the antics of birds\r\nduring courtship, but nothing nearly so much to the purpose as yours.\r\nI shall never be able to resist giving the whole substance of your last\r\nnote. It is quite a new light to me, except with the peacock and Bird\r\nof Paradise. I must now look to turkey's wings; but I do not think that\r\ntheir wings are beautiful when opened during courtship. Its tail is\r\nfinely banded. How about the drake and Gallus bankiva? I forget how\r\ntheir wings look when expanded. Your facts are all the more valuable\r\nas I now clearly see that for butterflies I must trust to analogy\r\naltogether in regard to sexual selection. But I think I shall make out a\r\nstrong case (as far as the rather deceitful guide of analogy will serve)\r\nin the sexes of butterflies being alike or differing greatly--in moths\r\nwhich do not display the lower surface of their wings not having them\r\ngaudily coloured, etc., etc.--nocturnal moths, etc.--and in some male\r\ninsects fighting for the females, and attracting them by music.\r\n\r\nMy discussion on sexual selection will be a curious one--a mere\r\ndovetailing of information derived from you, Bates, Wallace, etc., etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWe remain at above address all this month, and then return home. In the\r\nsummer, could I persuade you to pay us a visit of a day or two, and I\r\nwould try and get Bates and some others to come down? But my health is\r\nso precarious, I can ask no one who will not allow me the privilege of\r\na poor old invalid; for talking, I find by long and dear-bought\r\nexperience, tries my head more than anything, and I am utterly incapable\r\nof talking more than half an hour, except on rare occasions.\r\n\r\nI fear this note is very badly written; but I was very ill all\r\nyesterday, and my hand shakes to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 437. TO J. JENNER WEIR. 4, Chester Place, Regent's Park, N.W.,\r\nMarch 22nd [1868].\r\n\r\nI hope that you will not think me ungrateful that I have not sooner\r\nanswered your note of the 16th; but in fact I have been overwhelmed both\r\nwith calls and letters; and, alas! one visit to the British Museum of an\r\nhour or hour and a half does for me for the whole day.\r\n\r\nI was particularly glad to hear your and your brother's statement about\r\nthe \"gay\" deceiver-pigeons. (437/1. Some cock pigeons \"called by our\r\nEnglish fanciers gay birds are so successful in their gallantries that,\r\nas Mr. H. Weir informs me, they must be shut up, on account of the\r\nmischief which they cause.\") I did not at all know that certain birds\r\ncould win the affections of the females more than other males, except,\r\nindeed, in the case of the peacock. Conversely, Mr. Hewitt, I remember,\r\nstates that in making hybrids the cock pheasant would prefer certain hen\r\nfowls and strongly dislike others. I will write to Mr. H. in a few days,\r\nand ask him whether he has observed anything of this kind with pure\r\nunions of fowls, ducks, etc. I had utterly forgotten the case of the\r\nruff (437/2. The ruff, Machetes pugnax, was believed by Montague to be\r\npolygamous. \"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., Volume I., page 270.), but now\r\nI remember having heard that it was polygamous; but polygamy with birds,\r\nat least, does not seem common enough to have played an important part.\r\nSo little is known of habits of foreign birds: Wallace does not even\r\nknow whether Birds of Paradise are polygamous. Have you been a large\r\ncollector of caterpillars? I believe so. I inferred from a letter from\r\nDr. Wallace, of Colchester, that he would account for Mr. Stainton\r\nand others rearing more female than male by their having collected the\r\nlarger and finer caterpillars. But I misunderstood him, and he maintains\r\nthat collectors take all caterpillars, large and small, for that they\r\ncollect the caterpillars alone of the rarer moths or butterflies. What\r\nthink you? I hear from Professor Canestrini (437/3. See \"Descent of Man\"\r\n(1901), page 385.) in Italy that females are born in considerable excess\r\nwith Bombyx mori, and in greater excess of late years than formerly!\r\nQuatrefages writes to me that he believes they are equal in France.\r\nSo that the farther I go the deeper I sink into the mire. With cordial\r\nthanks for your most valuable letters.\r\n\r\nWe remain here till April 1st, and then hurrah for home and quiet work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 438. TO J. JENNER WEIR. 4, Chester Place, N.W., March 27th\r\n[1868].\r\n\r\nI hardly know which of your three last letters has interested me most.\r\nWhat splendid work I shall have hereafter in selecting and arranging\r\nall your facts. Your last letter is most curious--all about the\r\nbird-catchers--and interested us all. I suppose the male chaffinch\r\nin \"pegging\" approaches the captive singing-bird, from rivalry or\r\njealousy--if I am wrong please tell me; otherwise I will assume so. Can\r\nyou form any theory about all the many cases which you have given me,\r\nand others which have been published, of when one [of a] pair is killed,\r\nanother soon appearing? Your fact about the bullfinches in your garden\r\nis most curious on this head. (438/1. Mr. Weir stated that at Blackheath\r\nhe never saw or heard a wild bullfinch, yet when one of his caged males\r\ndied, a wild one in the course of a few days generally came and perched\r\nnear the widowed female, whose call-note is not loud. \"Descent of Man\"\r\n(1901), page 623.) Are there everywhere many unpaired birds? What can\r\nthe explanation be?\r\n\r\nMr. Gould assures me that all the nightingales which first come over are\r\nmales, and he believes this is so with other migratory birds. But this\r\ndoes not agree with what the bird-catchers say about the common linnet,\r\nwhich I suppose migrates within the limits of England.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for very curious case of Pavo nigripennis. (438/2. See\r\n\"Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume I., page 306.) I am very glad\r\nto get additional evidence. I have sent your fact to be inserted, if\r\nnot too late, in four foreign editions which are now printing. I am\r\ndelighted to hear that you approve of my book; I thought every mortal\r\nman would find the details very tedious, and have often repented of\r\ngiving so many. You will find pangenesis stiff reading, and I fear will\r\nshake your head in disapproval. Wallace sticks up for the great god Pan\r\nlike a man.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of hybrid canaries would be a fine subject for careful\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 439. TO J. JENNER WEIR. Down, April 4th [1868].\r\n\r\nI read over your last ten (!) letters this morning, and made an index\r\nof their contents for easy reference; and what a mine of wealth you\r\nhave bestowed on me. I am glad you will publish yourself on gay-coloured\r\ncaterpillars and birds (439/1. See \"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., Volume\r\nI., page 417, where Mr. Weir's experiments are given; they were made to\r\ntest Mr. Wallace's theory that caterpillars, which are protected against\r\nbirds by an unpleasant taste, have been rendered conspicuous, so that\r\nthey are easily recognised. They thus escape being pecked or tasted,\r\nwhich to soft-skinned animals would be as fatal as being devoured. See\r\nMr. Jenner Weir's papers, \"Transact. Entomolog. Soc.\" 1869, page 2;\r\n1870, page 337. In regard to one of these papers Mr. Darwin wrote (May\r\n13th, 1869): \"Your verification of Wallace's suggestion seems to me\r\nto amount to quite a discovery.\"); it seems to me much the best plan;\r\ntherefore, I will not forward your letter to Mr. Wallace. I was much\r\nin the Zoological Gardens during my month in London, and picked up\r\nwhat scraps of knowledge I could. Without my having mentioned your most\r\ninteresting observations on the display of the Fringillidae (439/2.\r\n\"Descent of Man\" (1901), page 738.), Mr. Bartlett told me how the Gold\r\nPheasant erects his collar and turns from side to side, displaying it\r\nto the hen. He has offered to give me notes on the display of all\r\nGallinaceae with which he is acquainted; but he is so busy a man that I\r\nrather doubt whether he will ever do so.\r\n\r\nI received about a week ago a remarkably kind letter from your brother,\r\nand I am sorry to hear that he suffers much in health. He gave me some\r\nfine facts about a Dun Hen Carrier which would never pair with a bird of\r\nany other colour. He told me, also, of some one at Lewes who paints his\r\ndog! and will inquire about it. By the way, Mr. Trimen tells me that as\r\na boy he used to paint butterflies, and that they long haunted the same\r\nplace, but he made no further observations on them. As far as colour is\r\nconcerned, I see I shall have to trust to mere inference from the males\r\ndisplaying their plumage, and other analogous facts. I shall get\r\nno direct evidence of the preference of the hens. Mr. Hewitt, of\r\nBirmingham, tells me that the common hen prefers a salacious cock, but\r\nis quite indifferent to colour.\r\n\r\nWill you consider and kindly give me your opinion on the two following\r\npoints. Do very vigorous and well-nourished hens receive the male\r\nearlier in the spring than weaker or poorer hens? I suppose that they\r\ndo. Secondly, do you suppose that the birds which pair first in the\r\nseason have any advantage in rearing numerous and healthy offspring over\r\nthose which pair later in the season? With respect to the mysterious\r\ncases of which you have given me so many, in addition to those\r\npreviously collected, of when one bird of a pair is shot another\r\nimmediately supplying its place, I was drawing to the conclusion that\r\nthere must be in each district several unpaired birds; yet this seems\r\nvery improbable. You allude, also, to the unknown causes which keep down\r\nthe numbers of birds; and often and often have I marvelled over this\r\nsubject with respect to many animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 440. TO A.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n(440/1. The following refers to Mr. Wallace's article \"A Theory of\r\nBirds' Nests,\" in Andrew Murray's \"Journal of Travel,\" Volume I., page\r\n73. He here treats in fuller detail the view already published in the\r\n\"Westminster Review,\" July 1867, page 38. The rule which Mr. Wallace\r\nbelieves, with very few exceptions, to hold good is, \"that when both\r\nsexes are of strikingly gay and conspicuous colours, the nest is...such\r\nas to conceal the sitting bird; while, whenever there is a striking\r\ncontrast of colours, the male being gay and conspicuous, the female dull\r\nand obscure, the nest is open, and the sitting bird exposed to view.\"\r\nAt this time Mr. Wallace allowed considerably more influence to sexual\r\nselection (in combination with the need of protection) than in his later\r\nwritings. The following extract from a letter from Mr. Wallace to Darwin\r\n(July 23rd, 1877) fixes the period at which the change in his views\r\noccurred: \"I am almost afraid to tell you that in going over the subject\r\nof the colours of animals, etc., etc., for a small volume of essays,\r\netc., I am preparing, I have come to conclusions directly opposed to\r\nvoluntary sexual selection, and believe that I can explain (in a general\r\nway) all the phenomena of sexual ornaments and colours by laws of\r\ndevelopment aided by simple 'Natural Selection.'\" He finally rejected\r\nMr. Darwin's theory that colours \"have been developed by the preference\r\nof the females, the more ornamented males becoming the parents of each\r\nsuccessive generation.\" \"Darwinism,\" 1889, page 285. See also Letters\r\n442, 443, 449, 450, etc.)\r\n\r\nDown, April 15th, [1868].\r\n\r\nI have been deeply interested by your admirable article on birds' nests.\r\nI am delighted to see that we really differ very little,--not more than\r\ntwo men almost always will. You do not lay much or any stress on new\r\ncharacters spontaneously appearing in one sex (generally the male), and\r\nbeing transmitted exclusively, or more commonly only in excess, to that\r\nsex. I, on the other hand, formerly paid far too little attention to\r\nprotection. I had only a glimpse of the truth; but even now I do not\r\ngo quite as far as you. I cannot avoid thinking rather more than you\r\ndo about the exceptions in nesting to the rule, especially the partial\r\nexceptions, i.e., when there is some little difference between the sexes\r\nin species which build concealed nests. I am not quite satisfied about\r\nthe incubating males; there is so little difference in conspicuousness\r\nbetween the sexes. I wish with all my heart I could go the whole length\r\nwith you. You seem to think that male birds probably select the most\r\nbeautiful females; I must feel some doubt on this head, for I can find\r\nno evidence of it. Though I am writing so carping a note, I admire the\r\narticle thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAnd now I want to ask a question. When female butterflies are more\r\nbrilliant than their males you believe that they have in most cases, or\r\nin all cases, been rendered brilliant so as to mimic some other species,\r\nand thus escape danger. But can you account for the males not having\r\nbeen rendered equally brilliant and equally protected? (440/2. See\r\nWallace in the \"Westminster Review,\" July, 1867, page 37, on the\r\nprotection to the female insect afforded by its resemblance either to an\r\ninanimate object or to another insect protected by its unpalatableness.\r\nThe cases are discussed in relation to the much greater importance (to\r\nthe species as a whole) of the preservation of the female insect with\r\nher load of eggs than the male who may safely be sacrificed after\r\npairing. See Letter 189, note.) Although it may be most for the welfare\r\nof the species that the female should be protected, yet it would be some\r\nadvantage, certainly no disadvantage, for the unfortunate male to enjoy\r\nan equal immunity from danger. For my part, I should say that the female\r\nalone had happened to vary in the right manner, and that the beneficial\r\nvariations had been transmitted to the same sex alone. Believing in\r\nthis, I can see no improbability (but from analogy of domestic animals\r\na strong probability) that variations leading to beauty must often have\r\noccurred in the males alone, and been transmitted to that sex alone.\r\nThus I should account in many cases for the greater beauty of the male\r\nover the female, without the need of the protective principle. I should\r\nbe grateful for an answer on the point.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 441. TO J. JENNER WEIR. Down, April 18th [1868].\r\n\r\nYou see that I have taken you at your word, and have not (owing to heaps\r\nof stupid letters) earlier noticed your three last letters, which as\r\nusual are rich in facts. Your letters make almost a little volume on my\r\ntable. I daresay you hardly knew yourself how much curious information\r\nwas lying in your mind till I began the severe pumping process. The case\r\nof the starling married thrice in one day is capital, and beats the\r\ncase of the magpies of which one was shot seven times consecutively. A\r\ngamekeeper here tells me that he has repeatedly shot one of a pair of\r\njays, and it has always been immediately replaced. I begin to think that\r\nthe pairing of birds must be as delicate and tedious an operation as\r\nthe pairing of young gentlemen and ladies. If I can convince myself that\r\nthere are habitually many unpaired birds, it will be a great aid to me\r\nin sexual selection, about which I have lately had many troubles, and\r\nam therefore rejoiced to hear in your last note that your faith keeps\r\nstaunch. That is a curious fact about the bullfinches all appearing to\r\nlisten to the German singer (441/1. See Letter 445, note.); and this\r\nleads me to ask how much faith may I put in the statement that male\r\nbirds will sing in rivalry until they injure themselves. Yarrell\r\nformerly told me that they would sometimes even sing themselves to\r\ndeath. I am sorry to hear that the painted bullfinch turns out to be a\r\nfemale; though she has done us a good turn in exhibiting her jealousy,\r\nof which I had no idea.\r\n\r\nThank you for telling me about the wildness of the hybrid canaries:\r\nnothing has hardly ever surprised me more than the many cases of\r\nreversion from crossing. Do you not think it a very curious subject? I\r\nhave not heard from Mr. Bartlett about the Gallinaceae, and I daresay I\r\nnever shall. He told me about the Tragopan, and he is positive that the\r\nblue wattle becomes gorged with blood, and not air.\r\n\r\nReturning to the first of the last three letters. It is most curious the\r\nnumber of persons of the name of Jenner who have had a strong taste for\r\nNatural History. It is a pity you cannot trace your connection with the\r\ngreat Jenner, for a duke might be proud of his blood.\r\n\r\nI heard lately from Professor Rolleston of the inherited effects of an\r\ninjury in the same eye. Is the scar on your son's leg on the same side\r\nand on exactly the same spot where you were wounded? And did the wound\r\nsuppurate, or heal by the first intention? I cannot persuade myself\r\nof the truth of the common belief of the influence of the mother's\r\nimagination on the child. A point just occurs to me (though it does\r\nnot at present concern me) about birds' nests. Have you read Wallace's\r\nrecent articles? (441/2. A full discussion of Mr. Wallace's views is\r\ngiven in \"Descent of Man,\" Edition I., Volume II., Chapter XV. Briefly,\r\nMr. Wallace's point is that the dull colour of the female bird is\r\nprotective by rendering her inconspicuous during incubation. Thus the\r\nrelatively bright colour of the male would not simply depend on sexual\r\nselection, but also on the hen being \"saved, through Natural Selection,\r\nfrom acquiring the conspicuous colours of the male\" (loc. cit., page\r\n155).) I always distrust myself when I differ from him; but I cannot\r\nadmit that birds learn to make their nests from having seen them\r\nwhilst young. I must think it as true an instinct as that which leads a\r\ncaterpillar to suspend its cocoon in a particular manner. Have you had\r\nany experience of birds hatched under a foster-mother making their nests\r\nin the proper manner? I cannot thank you enough for all your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 442. TO A.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n(442/1. Dr. Clifford Allbutt's view probably had reference to the fact\r\nthat the sperm-cell goes, or is carried, to the germ-cell, never vice\r\nversa. In this letter Darwin gives the reason for the \"law\" referred\r\nto. Mr. A.R. Wallace has been good enough to give us the following\r\nnote:--\"It was at this time that my paper on 'Protective Resemblance'\r\nfirst appeared in the 'Westminster Review,' in which I adduced the\r\ngreater, or rather, the more continuous, importance of the female\r\n(in the lower animals) for the race, and my 'Theory of Birds' Nests'\r\n('Journal of Travel and Natural History,' No. 2) in which I applied this\r\nto the usually dull colours of female butterflies and birds. It is\r\nto these articles as well as to my letters that Darwin chiefly\r\nrefers.\"--Note by Mr. Wallace, May 27th, 1902.)\r\n\r\nDown, April 30th [1868].\r\n\r\nYour letter, like so many previous ones, has interested me much. Dr.\r\nAllbutt's view occurred to me some time ago, and I have written a short\r\ndiscussion on it. It is, I think, a remarkable law, to which I have\r\nfound no exception. The foundation lies in the fact that in many cases\r\nthe eggs or seeds require nourishment and protection by the mother-form\r\nfor some time after impregnation. Hence the spermatozoa and antherozoids\r\ntravel in the lower aquatic animals and plants to the female, and pollen\r\nis borne to the female organ. As organisms rise in the scale it seems\r\nnatural that the male should carry the spermatozoa to the female in his\r\nown body. As the male is the searcher, he has required and gained more\r\neager passions than the female; and, very differently from you, I look\r\nat this as one great difficulty in believing that the males select the\r\nmore attractive females; as far as I can discover, they are always ready\r\nto seize on any female, and sometimes on many females. Nothing would\r\nplease me more than to find evidence of males selecting the more\r\nattractive females. I have for months been trying to persuade myself of\r\nthis. There is the case of man in favour of this belief, and I know in\r\nhybrid unions of males preferring particular females, but, alas, not\r\nguided by colour. Perhaps I may get more evidence as I wade through my\r\ntwenty years' mass of notes.\r\n\r\nI am not shaken about the female protected butterflies. I will grant\r\n(only for argument) that the life of the male is of very little\r\nvalue,--I will grant that the males do not vary, yet why has not the\r\nprotective beauty of the female been transferred by inheritance to the\r\nmale? The beauty would be a gain to the male, as far as we can see, as\r\na protection; and I cannot believe that it would be repulsive to the\r\nfemale as she became beautiful. But we shall never convince each other.\r\nI sometimes marvel how truth progresses, so difficult is it for one man\r\nto convince another, unless his mind is vacant. Nevertheless, I myself\r\nto a certain extent contradict my own remark, for I believe far more in\r\nthe importance of protection than I did before reading your articles.\r\n\r\nI do not think you lay nearly stress enough in your articles on what\r\nyou admit in your letters: viz., \"there seems to be some production of\r\nvividness...of colour in the male independent of protection.\" This I\r\nam making a chief point; and have come to your conclusion so far that\r\nI believe that intense colouring in the female sex is often checked by\r\nbeing dangerous.\r\n\r\nThat is an excellent remark of yours about no known case of male alone\r\nassuming protective colours; but in the cases in which protection has\r\nbeen gained by dull colours, I presume that sexual selection would\r\ninterfere with the male losing his beauty. If the male alone had\r\nacquired beauty as a protection, it would be most readily overlooked, as\r\nmales are so often more beautiful than their females. Moreover, I grant\r\nthat the life of the male is somewhat less precious, and thus there\r\nwould be less rigorous selection with the male, so he would be less\r\nlikely to be made beautiful through Natural Selection for protection.\r\n(442/2. This does not apply to sexual selection, for the greater the\r\nexcess of males, and the less precious their lives, so much the better\r\nfor sexual selection. [Note in original.]) But it seems to me a good\r\nargument, and very good if it could be thoroughly established. I do not\r\nknow whether you will care to read this scrawl.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 443. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, May 5th [1868?].\r\n\r\nI am afraid I have caused you a great deal of trouble in writing to me\r\nat such length. I am glad to say that I agree almost entirely with\r\nyour summary, except that I should put sexual selection as an equal,\r\nor perhaps as even a more important agent in giving colour than Natural\r\nSelection for protection. As I get on in my work I hope to get clearer\r\nand more decided ideas. Working up from the bottom of the scale, I have\r\nas yet only got to fishes. What I rather object to in your articles is\r\nthat I do not think any one would infer from them that you place sexual\r\nselection even as high as No. 4 in your summary. It was very natural\r\nthat you should give only a line to sexual selection in the summary to\r\nthe \"Westminster Review,\" but the result at first to my mind was that\r\nyou attributed hardly anything to its power. In your penultimate\r\nnote you say \"in the great mass of cases in which there is great\r\ndifferentiation of colour between the sexes, I believe it is due almost\r\nwholly to the need of protection to the female.\" Now, looking to the\r\nwhole animal kingdom, I can at present by no means admit this view; but\r\npray do not suppose that because I differ to a certain extent, I do not\r\nthoroughly admire your several papers and your admirable generalisation\r\non birds' nests. With respect to this latter point, however, although,\r\nfollowing you, I suspect that I shall ultimately look at the whole case\r\nfrom a rather different point of view.\r\n\r\nYou ask what I think about the gay-coloured females of Pieris. (443/1.\r\nSee \"Westminster Review,\" July, 1867, page 37; also Letter 440.) I\r\nbelieve I quite follow you in believing that the colours are wholly due\r\nto mimicry; and I further believe that the male is not brilliant from\r\nnot having received through inheritance colour from the female, and from\r\nnot himself having varied; in short, that he has not been influenced by\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nI can make no answer with respect to the elephants. With respect to\r\nthe female reindeer, I have hitherto looked at the horns simply as the\r\nconsequence of inheritance not having been limited by sex.\r\n\r\nYour idea about colour being concentrated in the smaller males seems\r\ngood, and I presume that you will not object to my giving it as your\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 444. TO J. JENNER WEIR. Down, May 7th [1868].\r\n\r\nI have now to thank you for no less than four letters! You are so kind\r\nthat I will not apologise for the trouble I cause you; but it has lately\r\noccurred to me that you ought to publish a paper or book on the habits\r\nof the birds which you have so carefully observed. But should you do\r\nthis, I do not think that my giving some of the facts for a special\r\nobject would much injure the novelty of your work. There is such a\r\nmultitude of points in these last letters that I hardly know what to\r\ntouch upon. Thanks about the instinct of nidification, and for your\r\nanswers on many points. I am glad to hear reports about the ferocious\r\nfemale bullfinch. I hope you will have another try in colouring males.\r\nI have now finished lepidoptera, and have used your facts about\r\ncaterpillars, and as a caution the case of the yellow-underwings. I\r\nhave now begun on fishes, and by comparing different classes of facts my\r\nviews are getting a little more decided. In about a fortnight or three\r\nweeks I shall come to birds, and then I dare say that I shall be extra\r\ntroublesome. I will now enclose a few queries for the mere chance of\r\nyour being able to answer some of them, and I think it will save you\r\ntrouble if I write them on a separate slip, and then you can sometimes\r\nanswer by a mere \"no\" or \"yes.\"\r\n\r\nYour last letter on male pigeons and linnets has interested me much, for\r\nthe precise facts which you have given me on display are of the utmost\r\nvalue for my work. I have written to Mr. Bartlett on Gallinaceae, but I\r\ndare say I shall not get an answer. I had heard before, but am glad to\r\nhave confirmation about the ruffs being the most numerous. I am greatly\r\nobliged to your brother for sending out circulars. I have not heard from\r\nhim as yet. I want to ask him whether he has ever observed when several\r\nmale pigeons are courting one female that the latter decides with which\r\nmale she will pair. The story about the black mark on the lambs must be\r\na hoax. The inaccuracy of many persons is wonderful. I should like to\r\ntell you a story, but it is too long, about beans growing on the wrong\r\nside of the pod during certain years.\r\n\r\nQueries:\r\n\r\nDoes any female bird regularly sing?\r\n\r\nDo you know any case of both sexes, more especially of the female,\r\n[being] more brightly coloured whilst young than when come to maturity\r\nand fit to breed? An imaginary instance would be if the female\r\nkingfisher (or male) became dull coloured when adult.\r\n\r\nDo you know whether the male and female wild canary bird differ in\r\nplumage (though I believe I could find this out for myself), and do any\r\nof the domestic breeds differ sexually?\r\n\r\nDo you know any gallinaceous bird in which the female has well developed\r\nspurs?\r\n\r\nIt is very odd that my memory should fail me, but I cannot remember\r\nwhether, in accordance with your views, the wing of Gallus bankiva (or\r\nGame-Cock, which is so like the wild) is ornamental when he opens and\r\nscrapes it before the female. I fear it is not; but though I have often\r\nlooked at wing of the wild and tame bird, I cannot call to mind the\r\nexact colours. What a number of points you have attended to; I did\r\nnot know that you were a horticulturist. I have often marvelled at the\r\ndifferent growth of the flowering and creeping branches of the ivy; but\r\nhad no idea that they kept their character when propagated by cuttings.\r\nThere is a S. American genus (name forgotten just now) which differs\r\nin an analogous manner but even greater degree, but it is difficult to\r\ncultivate in our hot-house. I have tried and failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 445. TO J. JENNER WEIR. Down, May 30th [1868].\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear your opinion on the nest-making instinct, for I am\r\nTory enough not to like to give up all old beliefs. Wallace's view\r\n(445/1. See Letter 440, etc.) is also opposed to a great mass of\r\nanalogical facts. The cases which you mention of suddenly reacquired\r\nwildness seem curious. I have also to thank you for a previous valuable\r\nletter. With respect to spurs on female Gallinaceae, I applied to Mr.\r\nBlyth, who has wonderful systematic knowledge, and he tells me that the\r\nfemale Pavo muticus and Fire-back pheasants are spurred. From various\r\ninterruptions I get on very slowly with my Bird MS., but have already\r\noften and often referred to your volume of letters, and have used\r\nvarious facts, and shall use many more. And now I am ashamed to say\r\nthat I have more questions to ask; but I forget--you told me not to\r\napologise.\r\n\r\n1. In your letter of April 14th you mention the case of about twenty\r\nbirds which seemed to listen with much interest to an excellent piping\r\nbullfinch. (445/2. Quoted in the \"Descent of Man\" (1901), page 564. \"A\r\nbullfinch which had been taught to pipe a German waltz...when this bird\r\nwas first introduced into a room where other birds were kept and he\r\nbegan to sing, all the others, consisting of about twenty linnets and\r\ncanaries, ranged themselves on the nearest side of their cages, and\r\nlistened with the greatest interest to the new performer.\") What kind of\r\nbirds were these twenty?\r\n\r\n2. Is it true, as often stated, that a bird reared by foster-parents,\r\nand who has never heard the song of its own species, imitates to a\r\ncertain extent the song of the species which it may be in the habit of\r\nhearing?\r\n\r\nNow for a more troublesome point. I find it very necessary to make\r\nout relation of immature plumage to adult plumage, both when the sexes\r\ndiffer and are alike in the adult state. Therefore, I want much to learn\r\nabout the first plumage (answering, for instance, to the speckled state\r\nof the robin before it acquires the red breast) of the several varieties\r\nof the canary. Can you help me? What is the character or colour of the\r\nfirst plumage of bright yellow or mealy canaries which breed true to\r\nthese tints? So with the mottled-brown canaries, for I believe that\r\nthere are breeds which always come brown and mottled. Lastly, in the\r\n\"prize-canaries,\" which have black wing- and tail-feathers during their\r\nfirst (?) plumage, what colours are the wings and tails after the first\r\n(?) moult or when adult? I should be particularly glad to learn this.\r\nHeaven have mercy on you, for it is clear that I have none. I am going\r\nto investigate this same point with all the breeds of fowls, as Mr.\r\nTegetmeier will procure for me young birds, about two months old, of all\r\nthe breeds.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this next month I hope you will come down here on the\r\nSaturday and stay over the Sunday. Some months ago Mr. Bates said\r\nhe would pay me a visit during June, and I have thought it would be\r\npleasanter for you to come here when I can get him, so that you would\r\nhave a companion if I get knocked up, as is sadly too often my bad habit\r\nand great misfortune.\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear of the existence of any sub-breed of the canary in\r\nwhich the male differs in plumage from the female?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 446. TO F. MULLER. Down, June 3rd [1868].\r\n\r\nYour letter of April 22nd has much interested me. I am delighted that\r\nyou approve of my book, for I value your opinion more than that of\r\nalmost any one. I have yet hopes that you will think well of pangenesis.\r\nI feel sure that our minds are somewhat alike, and I find it a great\r\nrelief to have some definite, though hypothetical view, when I reflect\r\non the wonderful transformations of animals, the re-growth of parts, and\r\nespecially the direct action of pollen on the mother form, etc. It often\r\nappears to me almost certain that the characters of the parents are\r\n\"photographed\" on the child, only by means of material atoms derived\r\nfrom each cell in both parents, and developed in the child. I am sorry\r\nabout the mistake in regard to Leptotes. (446/1. See \"Animals and\r\nPlants,\" Edition I., Volume II., page 134, where it is stated that\r\nOncidium is fertile with Leptotes, a mistake corrected in the 2nd\r\nedition.) I daresay it was my fault, yet I took pains to avoid such\r\nblunders. Many thanks for all the curious facts about the unequal number\r\nof the sexes in crustacea, but the more I investigate this subject\r\nthe deeper I sink in doubt and difficulty. Thanks, also, for the\r\nconfirmation of the rivalry of Cicadae. (446/2. See \"Descent of Man,\"\r\nEdition I., Volume I., page 351, for F. Muller's observations; and for\r\na reference to Landois' paper.) I have often reflected with surprise on\r\nthe diversity of the means for producing music with insects, and still\r\nmore with birds. We thus get a high idea of the importance of song in\r\nthe animal kingdom. Please to tell me where I can find any account of\r\nthe auditory organs in the orthoptera? Your facts are quite new to me.\r\nScudder has described an annectant insect in Devonian strata, furnished\r\nwith a stridulating apparatus. (446/3. The insect is no doubt Xenoneura\r\nantiquorum, from the Devonian rocks of New Brunswick. Scudder compared\r\na peculiar feature in the wing of this species to the stridulating\r\napparatus of the Locustariae, but afterwards stated that he had been led\r\nastray in his original description, and that there was no evidence in\r\nsupport of the comparison with a stridulating organ. See the \"Devonian\r\nInsects of New Brunswick,\" reprinted in S.H. Scudder's \"Fossil Insects\r\nof N. America,\" Volume I., page 179, New York, 1890.) I believe he is to\r\nbe trusted, and if so the apparatus is of astonishing antiquity. After\r\nreading Landois' paper I have been working at the stridulating organ in\r\nthe lamellicorn beetles, in expectation of finding it sexual, but I have\r\nonly found it as yet in two cases, and in these it was equally developed\r\nin both sexes. I wish you would look at any of your common lamellicorns\r\nand take hold of both males and females and observe whether they make\r\nthe squeaking or grating noise equally. If they do not, you could\r\nperhaps send me a male and female in a light little box. How curious\r\nit is that there should be a special organ for an object apparently so\r\nunimportant as squeaking. Here is another point: have you any Toucans?\r\nif so, ask any trustworthy hunter whether the beaks of the males, or of\r\nboth sexes, are more brightly coloured during the breeding season than\r\nat other times of the year? I have also to thank you for a previous\r\nletter of April 3rd, with some interesting facts on the variation of\r\nmaize, the sterility of Bignonia and on conspicuous seeds. Heaven knows\r\nwhether I shall ever live to make use of half the valuable facts which\r\nyou have communicated to me...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 447. TO J. JENNER WEIR. Down, June 18th [1868].\r\n\r\nMany thanks. I am glad that you mentioned the linnet, for I had much\r\ndifficulty in persuading myself that the crimson breast could be due to\r\nchange in the old feathers, as the books say. I am glad to hear of the\r\nretribution of the wicked old she-bullfinch. You remember telling me how\r\nmany Weirs and Jenners have been naturalists; now this morning I have\r\nbeen putting together all my references about one bird of a pair being\r\nkilled, and a new mate being soon found; you, Jenner Weir, have given\r\nme some most striking cases with starlings; Dr. Jenner gives the most\r\ncurious case of all in \"Philosophical Transactions\" (447/1. \"Phil.\r\nTrans.\" 1824.), and a Mr. Weir gives the next most striking in\r\nMacgillivray. (447/2. Macgillivray's \"History of British Birds,\" Volume\r\nI., page 570. See \"Descent of Man\" (1901), page 621.) Now, is this not\r\nodd? Pray remember how very glad we shall be to see you here whenever\r\nyou can come.\r\n\r\nDid some ancient progenitor of the Weirs and Jenners puzzle his brains\r\nabout the mating of birds, and has the question become indelibly fixed\r\nin all your minds?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 448. TO A.R. WALLACE. August 19th [1868].\r\n\r\nI had become, before my nine weeks' horrid interruption of all work,\r\nextremely interested in sexual selection, and was making fair progress.\r\nIn truth it has vexed me much to find that the farther I get on the more\r\nI differ from you about the females being dull-coloured for protection.\r\nI can now hardly express myself as strongly, even, as in the \"Origin.\"\r\nThis has much decreased the pleasure of my work. In the course of\r\nSeptember, if I can get at all stronger, I hope to get Mr. J. Jenner\r\nWeir (who has been wonderfully kind in giving me information) to pay\r\nme a visit, and I will then write for the chance of your being able to\r\ncome, and I hope bring with you Mrs. Wallace. If I could get several of\r\nyou together it would be less dull for you, for of late I have found\r\nit impossible to talk with any human being for more than half an hour,\r\nexcept on extraordinary good days.\r\n\r\n(448/1. On September 16th Darwin wrote to Wallace on the same\r\nsubject:--)\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased to hear that I am undergoing severe distress about\r\nprotection and sexual selection; this morning I oscillated with joy\r\ntowards you; this evening I have swung back to the old position, out of\r\nwhich I fear I shall never get.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 449. TO A.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n(449/1. From \"Life and Letters,\" Volume III., page 123.)\r\n\r\nDown, September 23rd [1868].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for all your trouble in writing me your long\r\nletter, which I will keep by me and ponder over. To answer it would\r\nrequire at least 200 folio pages! If you could see how often I have\r\nrewritten some pages you would know how anxious I am to arrive as near\r\nas I can to the truth. I lay great stress on what I know takes place\r\nunder domestication; I think we start with different fundamental\r\nnotions on inheritance. I find it is most difficult, but not, I think,\r\nimpossible to see how, for instance, a few red feathers appearing on the\r\nhead of a male bird, and which are at first transmitted to both sexes,\r\nwould come to be transmitted to males alone. It is not enough that\r\nfemales should be produced from the males with red feathers, which\r\nshould be destitute of red feathers; but these females must have a\r\nlatent tendency to produce such feathers, otherwise they would cause\r\ndeterioration in the red head-feathers of their male offspring. Such\r\nlatent tendency would be shown by their producing the red feathers when\r\nold, or diseased in their ovaria. But I have no difficulty in making the\r\nwhole head red if the few red feathers in the male from the first tended\r\nto be sexually transmitted. I am quite willing to admit that the female\r\nmay have been modified, either at the same time or subsequently,\r\nfor protection by the accumulation of variations limited in their\r\ntransmission to the female sex. I owe to your writings the consideration\r\nof this latter point. But I cannot yet persuade myself that females\r\nalone have often been modified for protection. Should you grudge the\r\ntrouble briefly to tell me, whether you believe that the plainer head\r\nand less bright colours of female chaffinch, the less red on the head\r\nand less clean colours of female goldfinch, the much less red on the\r\nbreast of the female bullfinch, the paler crest of golden-crested wren,\r\netc., have been acquired by them for protection? I cannot think so, any\r\nmore than I can that the considerable differences between female and\r\nmale house-sparrow, or much greater brightness of male Parus caeruleus\r\n(both of which build under cover) than of female Parus, are related to\r\nprotection. I even misdoubt much whether the less blackness of female\r\nblackbird is for protection.\r\n\r\nAgain, can you give me reasons for believing that the moderate\r\ndifferences between the female pheasant, the female Gallus bankiva,\r\nthe female of black grouse, the pea-hen, the female partridge, have all\r\nspecial references to protection under slightly different conditions? I,\r\nof course, admit that they are all protected by dull colours, derived,\r\nas I think, from some dull-ground progenitor; and I account partly for\r\ntheir difference by partial transference of colour from the male, and by\r\nother means too long to specify; but I earnestly wish to see reason\r\nto believe that each is specially adapted for concealment to its\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nI grieve to differ from you, and it actually terrifies me and makes me\r\nconstantly distrust myself. I fear we shall never quite understand each\r\nother. I value the cases of bright-coloured, incubating male fisher, and\r\nbrilliant female butterflies, solely as showing that one sex may be made\r\nbrilliant without any necessary transference of beauty to the other sex;\r\nfor in these cases I cannot suppose that beauty in the other sex was\r\nchecked by selection.\r\n\r\nI fear this letter will trouble you to read it. A very short answer\r\nabout your belief in regard to the female finches and Gallinaceae would\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 450. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. 9, St. Mark's Crescent,\r\nN.W., September 27th, 1868.\r\n\r\nYour view seems to be that variations occurring in one sex are\r\ntransmitted either to that sex exclusively or to both sexes equally, or\r\nmore rarely partially transferred. But we have every gradation of\r\nsexual colours, from total dissimilarity to perfect identity. If this is\r\nexplained solely by the laws of inheritance, then the colours of one or\r\nother sex will be always (in relation to the environment) a matter of\r\nchance. I cannot think this. I think selection more powerful than laws\r\nof inheritance, of which it makes use, as shown by cases of two, three\r\nor four forms of female butterflies, all of which have, I have little\r\ndoubt, been specialised for protection.\r\n\r\nTo answer your first question is most difficult, if not impossible,\r\nbecause we have no sufficient evidence in individual cases of slight\r\nsexual difference, to determine whether the male alone has acquired his\r\nsuperior brightness by sexual selection, or the female been made duller\r\nby need of protection, or whether the two causes have acted. Many of the\r\nsexual differences of existing species may be inherited differences from\r\nparent forms, which existed under different conditions and had greater\r\nor less need of protection.\r\n\r\nI think I admitted before, the general tendency (probably) of males to\r\nacquire brighter tints. Yet this cannot be universal, for many female\r\nbirds and quadrupeds have equally bright tints.\r\n\r\nTo your second question I can reply more decidedly. I do think the\r\nfemales of the Gallinaceae you mention have been modified or been\r\nprevented from acquiring the brighter plumage of the male, by need of\r\nprotection. I know that the Gallus bankiva frequents drier and more open\r\nsituations than the pea-hen of Java, which is found among grassy and\r\nleafy vegetation, corresponding with the colours of the two. So the\r\nArgus pheasant, male and female, are, I feel sure, protected by their\r\ntints corresponding to the dead leaves of the lofty forest in which\r\nthey dwell, and the female of the gorgeous fire-back pheasant Lophura\r\nviellottii is of a very similar rich brown colour.\r\n\r\nI do not, however, at all think the question can be settled by\r\nindividual cases, but by only large masses of facts. The colours of the\r\nmass of female birds seem to me strictly analogous to the colours of\r\nboth sexes of snipes, woodcocks, plovers, etc., which are undoubtedly\r\nprotective.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing, on your view, that the colours of a male bird become\r\nmore and more brilliant by sexual selection, and a good deal of that\r\ncolour is transmitted to the female till it becomes positively injurious\r\nto her during incubation, and the race is in danger of extinction; do\r\nyou not think that all the females who had acquired less of the male's\r\nbright colours, or who themselves varied in a protective direction,\r\nwould be preserved, and that thus a good protective colouring would soon\r\nbe acquired?\r\n\r\nIf you admit that this could occur, and can show no good reason why it\r\nshould not often occur, then we no longer differ, for this is the main\r\npoint of my view.\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought of the red wax-tips of the Bombycilla beautifully\r\nimitating the red fructification of lichens used in the nest, and\r\ntherefore the FEMALES have it too? Yet this is a very sexual-looking\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIf sexes have been differentiated entirely by sexual selection the\r\nfemales can have no relation to environment. But in groups when both\r\nsexes require protection during feeding or repose, as snipes, woodcock,\r\nptarmigan, desert birds and animals, green forest birds, etc., arctic\r\nbirds of prey, and animals, then both sexes are modified for protection.\r\nWhy should that power entirely cease to act when sexual differentiation\r\nexists and when the female requires protection, and why should the\r\ncolour of so many FEMALE BIRDS seem to be protective, if it has not been\r\nmade protective by selection.\r\n\r\nIt is contrary to the principles of \"Origin of Species,\" that colour\r\nshould have been produced in both sexes by sexual selection and\r\nnever have been modified to bring the female into harmony with the\r\nenvironment. \"Sexual selection is less rigorous than Natural Selection,\"\r\nand will therefore be subordinate to it.\r\n\r\nI think the case of female Pieris pyrrha proves that females alone can\r\nbe greatly modified for protection. (450/1. My latest views on this\r\nsubject, with many new facts and arguments, will be found in the later\r\neditions of my \"Darwinism,\" Chapter X. (A.R.W.))\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 451. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(451/1. On October 4th, 1868, Mr. Wallace wrote again on the same\r\nsubject without adding anything of importance to his arguments of\r\nSeptember 27th. We give his final remarks:--)\r\n\r\nOctober 4th, 1868.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to find that our difference of opinion on this point is a\r\nsource of anxiety to you. Pray do not let it be so. The truth will come\r\nout at last, and our difference may be the means of setting others to\r\nwork who may set us both right. After all, this question is only an\r\nepisode (though an important one) in the great question of the \"Origin\r\nof Species,\" and whether you or I are right will not at all affect the\r\nmain doctrine--that is one comfort.\r\n\r\nI hope you will publish your treatise on \"Sexual Selection\" as a\r\nseparate book as soon as possible; and then, while you are going on with\r\nyour other work, there will no doubt be found some one to battle with me\r\nover your facts on this hard problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 452. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, October 6th [1868].\r\n\r\nYour letter is very valuable to me, and in every way very kind. I will\r\nnot inflict a long answer, but only answer your queries. There are\r\nbreeds (viz. Hamburg) in which both sexes differ much from each other\r\nand from both sexes of Gallus bankiva; and both sexes are kept constant\r\nby selection. The comb of the Spanish male has been ordered to be\r\nupright, and that of Spanish female to lop over, and this has been\r\neffected. There are sub-breeds of game fowl, with females very distinct\r\nand males almost identical; but this, apparently, is the result of\r\nspontaneous variation, without special selection. I am very glad to hear\r\nof case of female Birds of Paradise.\r\n\r\nI have never in the least doubted possibility of modifying female birds\r\nalone for protection, and I have long believed it for butterflies. I\r\nhave wanted only evidence for the female alone of birds having had their\r\ncolour modified for protection. But then I believe that the variations\r\nby which a female bird or butterfly could get or has got protective\r\ncolouring have probably from the first been variations limited in their\r\ntransmission to the female sex. And so with the variations of the\r\nmale: when the male is more beautiful than the female, I believe the\r\nvariations were sexually limited in their transmission to the males.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 453. TO B.D. WALSH. Down, October 31st, 1868.\r\n\r\n(453/1. A short account of the Periodical Cicada (C. septendecim) is\r\ngiven by Dr. Sharp in the Cambridge Natural History, Insects II., page\r\n570. We are indebted to Dr. Sharp for calling our attention to Mr. C.L.\r\nMarlatt's full account of the insect in \"Bulletin No. 14 [NS.] of the\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture,\" 1898. The Cicada lives for long periods\r\nunderground as larva and pupa, so that swarms of the adults of one\r\nrace (septendecim) appear at intervals of 17 years, while those of the\r\nsouthern form or race (tredecim) appear at intervals of 13 years.\r\nThis fact was first made out by Phares in 1845, but was overlooked or\r\nforgotten, and was only re-discovered by Walsh and Riley in 1868, who\r\npublished a joint paper in the \"American Entomologist,\" Volume I., page\r\n63. Walsh appears to have adhered to the view that the 13- and 17-year\r\nforms are distinct species, though, as we gather from Marlatt's paper\r\n(page 14), he published a letter to Mr. Darwin in which he speaks of the\r\n13-year form as an incipient species; see \"Index to Missouri Entomolog.\r\nReports Bull. 6,\" U.S.E.C., page 58 (as given by Marlatt). With regard\r\nto the cause of the difference in period of the two forms, Marlatt\r\n(pages 15, 16) refers doubtfully to difference of temperature as the\r\ndetermining factor. Experiments have been instituted by moving 17-year\r\neggs to the south, and vice versa with 13-year eggs. The results were,\r\nhowever, not known at the time of publication of Marlatt's paper.)\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for the extracts about the \"drumming,\" which will\r\nbe of real use to me.\r\n\r\nI do not at all know what to think of your extraordinary case of the\r\nCicadas. Professor Asa Gray and Dr. Hooker were staying here, and I told\r\nthem of the facts. They thought that the 13-year and the 17-year forms\r\nought not to be ranked as distinct species, unless other differences\r\nbesides the period of development could be discovered. They thought the\r\nmere rarity of variability in such a point was not sufficient, and I\r\nthink I concur with them. The fact of both the forms presenting the same\r\ncase of dimorphism is very curious. I have long wished that some one\r\nwould dissect the forms of the male stag-beetle with smaller mandibles,\r\nand see if they were well developed, i.e., whether there was an\r\nabundance of spermatozoa; and the same observations ought, I think,\r\nto be made on the rarer form of your Cicada. Could you not get some\r\nobserver, such as Dr. Hartman (453/2. Mr. Walsh sent Mr. Darwin\r\nan extract from Dr. Hartman's \"Journal of the doings of a Cicada\r\nseptendecim,\" in which the females are described as flocking round the\r\ndrumming males. \"Descent of Man\" (1901), page 433.), to note whether the\r\nfemales flocked in equal numbers to the \"drumming\" of the rarer form as\r\nto the common form? You have a very curious and perplexing subject of\r\ninvestigation, and I wish you success in your work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 454. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, June 15th [1869?].\r\n\r\nYou must not suppose from my delay that I have not been much interested\r\nby your long letter. I write now merely to thank you, and just to say\r\nthat probably you are right on all the points you touch on, except, as\r\nI think, about sexual selection, which I will not give up. My belief in\r\nit, however, is contingent on my general belief in sexual selection. It\r\nis an awful stretcher to believe that a peacock's tail was thus formed;\r\nbut, believing it, I believe in the same principle somewhat modified\r\napplied to man.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 455. TO G.H.K. THWAITES. Down, February 13th [N.D.]\r\n\r\nI wrote a little time ago asking you an odd question about elephants,\r\nand now I am going to ask you an odder. I hope that you will not think\r\nme an intolerable bore. It is most improbable that you could get me\r\nan answer, but I ask on mere chance. Macacus silenus (455/1. Macacus\r\nsilenus L., an Indian ape.) has a great mane of hair round neck, and\r\npassing into large whiskers and beard. Now what I want most especially\r\nto know is whether these monkeys, when they fight in confinement (and\r\nI have seen it stated that they are sometimes kept in confinement), are\r\nprotected from bites by this mane and beard. Any one who watched them\r\nfighting would, I think, be able to judge on this head. My object is to\r\nfind out with various animals how far the mane is of any use, or a mere\r\nornament. Is the male Macacus silenus furnished with longer hair than\r\nthe female about the neck and face? As I said, it is a hundred or a\r\nthousand to one against your finding out any one who has kept these\r\nmonkeys in confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 456. TO F. MULLER. Down, August 28th [1870].\r\n\r\nI have to thank you very sincerely for two letters: one of April 25th,\r\ncontaining a very curious account of the structure and morphology of\r\nBonatea. I feel that it is quite a sin that your letters should not all\r\nbe published! but, in truth, I have no spare strength to undertake any\r\nextra work, which, though slight, would follow from seeing your letters\r\nin English through the press--not but that you write almost as clearly\r\nas any Englishman. This same letter also contained some seeds for Mr.\r\nFarrer, which he was very glad to receive.\r\n\r\nYour second letter, of July 5th, was chiefly devoted to mimicry in\r\nlepidoptera: many of your remarks seem to me so good, that I have\r\nforwarded your letter to Mr. Bates; but he is out of London having his\r\nsummer holiday, and I have not yet heard from him. Your remark about\r\nimitators and imitated being of such different sizes, and the lower\r\nsurface of the wings not being altered in colour, strike me as the most\r\ncurious points. I should not be at all surprised if your suggestion\r\nabout sexual selection were to prove true; but it seems rather too\r\nspeculative to be introduced in my book, more especially as my book is\r\nalready far too speculative. The very same difficulty about brightly\r\ncoloured caterpillars had occurred to me, and you will see in my book\r\nwhat, I believe, is the true explanation from Wallace. The same view\r\nprobably applies in part to gaudy butterflies. My MS. is sent to the\r\nprinters, and, I suppose, will be published in about three months:\r\nof course I will send you a copy. By the way, I settled with Murray\r\nrecently with respect to your book (456/1. The translation of \"Fur\r\nDarwin,\" published in 1869.), and had to pay him only 21 pounds\r\n2 shillings 3 pence, which I consider a very small price for the\r\ndissemination of your views; he has 547 copies as yet unsold. This most\r\nterrible war will stop all science in France and Germany for a long\r\ntime. I have heard from nobody in Germany, and know not whether your\r\nbrother, Hackel, Gegenbaur, Victor Carus, or my other friends are\r\nserving in the army. Dohrn has joined a cavalry regiment. I have not yet\r\nmet a soul in England who does not rejoice in the splendid triumph of\r\nGermany over France (456/2. See Letter 239, Volume I.): it is a most\r\njust retribution against that vainglorious, war-liking nation. As the\r\nposts are all in confusion, I will not send this letter through\r\nFrance. The Editor has sent me duplicate copies of the \"Revue des Cours\r\nScientifiques,\" which contain several articles about my views; so I send\r\nyou copies for the chance of your liking to see them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 457. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. Holly House, Barking, E.,\r\nJanuary 27th, 1871.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your first volume (457/1. \"The Descent of Man\".), which\r\nI have just finished reading through with the greatest pleasure and\r\ninterest; and I have also to thank you for the great tenderness with\r\nwhich you have treated me and my heresies.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of \"sexual selection\" and \"protection,\" you do not yet\r\nconvince me that I am wrong; but I expect your heaviest artillery will\r\nbe brought up in your second volume, and I may have to capitulate. You\r\nseem, however, to have somewhat misunderstood my exact meaning, and I\r\ndo not think the difference between us is quite so great as you seem to\r\nthink it. There are a number of passages in which you argue against the\r\nview that the female has in any large number of cases been \"specially\r\nmodified\" for protection, or that colour has generally been obtained by\r\neither sex for purposes of protection. But my view is, as I thought\r\nI had made it clear, that the female has (in most cases) been simply\r\nprevented from acquiring the gay tints of the male (even when there was\r\na tendency for her to inherit it), because it was hurtful; and that,\r\nwhen protection is not needed, gay colours are so generally acquired\r\nby both sexes as to show that inheritance by both sexes of colour\r\nvariations is the most usual, when not prevented from acting by Natural\r\nSelection. The colour itself may be acquired either by sexual selection\r\nor by other unknown causes.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, difficulties in the very wide application you give\r\nto sexual selection which at present stagger me, though no one was or\r\nis more ready than myself to admit the perfect truth of the principle or\r\nthe immense importance and great variety of its applications.\r\n\r\nYour chapters on \"Man\" are of intense interest--but as touching my\r\nspecial heresy, not as yet altogether convincing, though, of course, I\r\nfully agree with every word and every argument which goes to prove\r\nthe \"evolution\" or \"development\" of man out of a lower form. My ONLY\r\ndifficulties are, as to whether you have accounted for EVERY STEP of the\r\ndevelopment by ascertained laws.\r\n\r\nI feel sure that the book will keep up and increase your high\r\nreputation, and be immensely successful, as it deserves to be...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 458. TO G.B. MURDOCH. Down, March 13th, 1871.\r\n\r\n(458/1. We are indebted to Mr. Murdoch for a draft of his letter dated\r\nMarch 10th, 1871. It is too long to be quoted at length; the following\r\ncitations give some idea of its contents: \"In your 'Descent of Man,' in\r\ntreating of the external differences between males and females of the\r\nsame variety, have you attached sufficient importance to the different\r\namount and kind of energy expended by them in reproduction?\" Mr. Murdoch\r\nsums up: \"Is it wrong, then, to suppose that extra growth, complicated\r\nstructure, and activity in one sex exist as escape-valves for surplus\r\nvigour, rather than to please or fight with, though they may serve these\r\npurposes and be modified by them?\")\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your valuable letter. I am strongly inclined to\r\nthink that I have made a great and complete oversight with respect to\r\nthe subject which you discuss. I am the more surprised at this, as I\r\nremember reflecting on some points which ought to have led me to your\r\nconclusion. By an odd chance I received the day before yesterday a\r\nletter from Mr. Lowne (author of an excellent book on the anatomy of\r\nthe Blow-fly) (458/2. \"The Anatomy and Physiology of the Blow-fly (Musca\r\nvomitaria L.),\" by B.T. Lowne. London, 1870.) with a discussion very\r\nnearly to the same effect as yours. His conclusions were drawn from\r\nstudying male insects with great horns, mandibles, etc. He informs me\r\nthat his paper on this subject will soon be published in the \"Transact.\r\nEntomolog. Society.\" (458/3. \"Observations on Immature Sexuality and\r\nAlternate Generation in Insects.\" By B.T. Lowne. \"Trans. Entomolog.\r\nSoc.\" 1871 [Read March 6th, 1871]. \"I believe that certain cutaneous\r\nappendages, as the gigantic mandibles and thoracic horns of many males,\r\nare complemental to the sexual organs; that, in point of fact, they are\r\nproduced by the excess of nutriment in the male, which in the female\r\nwould go to form the generative organs and ova\" (loc. cit., page 197).)\r\nI am inclined to look at your and Mr. Lowne's view as specially valuable\r\nfrom probably throwing light on the greater variability of male than\r\nfemale animals, which manifestly has much bearing on sexual selection.\r\nI will keep your remarks in mind whenever a new edition of my book is\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 459. TO GEORGE FRASER.\r\n\r\n(459/1. The following letter refers to two letters to Mr. Darwin, in\r\nwhich Mr. Fraser pointed out that illustrations of the theory of Sexual\r\nSelection might be found amongst British butterflies and moths. Mr.\r\nFraser, in explanation of the letters, writes: \"As an altogether unknown\r\nand far from experienced naturalist, I feared to send my letters\r\nfor publication without, in the first place, obtaining Mr. Darwin's\r\napproval.\" The information was published in \"Nature,\" Volume III., April\r\n20th, 1871, page 489. The article was referred to in the second edition\r\nof the \"Descent of Man\" (1874), pages 312, 316, 319. Mr. Fraser\r\nadds: \"This is only another illustration of Mr. Darwin's great\r\nconscientiousness in acknowledging suggestions received by him from the\r\nmost humble sources.\" (Letter from Mr. Fraser to F. Darwin, March 21,\r\n1888.)\r\n\r\nDown, April 14th [1871].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your letter and the interesting facts which\r\nit contains, and which are new to me. But I am at present so much\r\nengaged with other subjects that I cannot fully consider them; and, even\r\nif I had time, I do not suppose that I should have anything to say worth\r\nprinting in a scientific journal. It would obviously be absurd in me to\r\nallow a mere note of thanks from me to be printed. Whenever I have\r\nto bring out a corrected edition of my book I will well consider\r\nyour remarks (which I hope that you will send to \"Nature\"), but\r\nthe difficulty will be that my friends tell me that I have already\r\nintroduced too many facts, and that I ought to prune rather than to\r\nintroduce more.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 460. TO E.S. MORSE. Down, December 3rd, 1871.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you for having sent me your two interesting papers,\r\nand for the kind writing on the cover. I am very glad to have my error\r\ncorrected about the protective colouring of shells. (460/1. \"On Adaptive\r\nColoration of the Mollusca,\" \"Boston Society of Natural History Proc.\"\r\nVolume XIV., April 5th, 1871. Mr. Morse quotes from the \"Descent of\r\nMan,\" I., page 316, a passage to the effect that the colours of the\r\nmollusca do not in general appear to be protective. Mr. Morse goes on to\r\ngive instances of protective coloration.) It is no excuse for my broad\r\nstatement, but I had in my mind the species which are brightly or\r\nbeautifully coloured, and I can as yet hardly think that the colouring\r\nin such cases is protective.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 461. TO AUG. WEISMANN. Down, February 29th, 1872.\r\n\r\nI am rejoiced to hear that your eyesight is somewhat better; but I fear\r\nthat work with the microscope is still out of your power. I have often\r\nthought with sincere sympathy how much you must have suffered from your\r\ngrand line of embryological research having been stopped. It was very\r\ngood of you to use your eyes in writing to me. I have just received your\r\nessay (461/1. \"Ueber der Einfluss der Isolirung auf die Artbildung\":\r\nLeipzig, 1872.); but as I am now staying in London for the sake of rest,\r\nand as German is at all times very difficult to me, I shall not be able\r\nto read your essay for some little time. I am, however, very curious to\r\nlearn what you have to say on isolation and on periods of variation.\r\nI thought much about isolation when I wrote in Chapter IV. on the\r\ncircumstances favourable to Natural Selection. No doubt there remains\r\nan immense deal of work to do on \"Artbildung.\" I have only opened a path\r\nfor others to enter, and in the course of time to make a broad and clear\r\nhigh-road. I am especially glad that you are turning your attention to\r\nsexual selection. I have in this country hardly found any naturalists\r\nwho agree with me on this subject, even to a moderate extent. They think\r\nit absurd that a female bird should be able to appreciate the splendid\r\nplumage of the male; but it would take much to persuade me that the\r\npeacock does not spread his gorgeous tail in the presence of the female\r\nin order to fascinate or excite her. The case, no doubt, is much more\r\ndifficult with insects. I fear that you will find it difficult to\r\nexperiment on diurnal lepidoptera in confinement, for I have never heard\r\nof any of these breeding in this state. (461/2. We are indebted to Mr.\r\nBateson for the following note: \"This belief does not seem to be well\r\nfounded, for since Darwin's time several species of Rhopalocera (e.g.\r\nPieris, Pararge, Caenonympha) have been successfully bred in confinement\r\nwithout any special difficulty; and by the use of large cages members\r\neven of strong-flying genera, such as Vanessa, have been induced to\r\nbreed.\") I was extremely pleased at hearing from Fritz Muller that he\r\nliked my chapter on lepidoptera in the \"Descent of Man\" more than any\r\nother part, excepting the chapter on morals.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 462. TO H. MULLER. Down [May, 1872].\r\n\r\nI have now read with the greatest interest your essay, which contains\r\na vast amount of matter quite new to me. (462/1. \"Anwendung der\r\nDarwin'schen Lehre auf Bienen,\" \"Verhandl. d. naturhist. Vereins fur\r\npreuss. Rheinld. u. Westf.\" 1872. References to Muller's paper occur in\r\nthe second edition of the \"Descent of Man.\") I really have no criticisms\r\nor suggestions to offer. The perfection of the gradation in the\r\ncharacter of bees, especially in such important parts as the\r\nmouth-organs, was altogether unknown to me. You bring out all such facts\r\nvery clearly by your comparison with the corresponding organs in the\r\nallied hymenoptera. How very curious is the case of bees and wasps\r\nhaving acquired, independently of inheritance from a common source, the\r\nhabit of building hexagonal cells and of producing sterile workers!\r\nBut I have been most interested by your discussion on secondary sexual\r\ndifferences; I do not suppose so full an account of such differences in\r\nany other group of animals has ever been published. It delights me\r\nto find that we have independently arrived at almost exactly the\r\nsame conclusion with respect to the more important points deserving\r\ninvestigation in relation to sexual selection. For instance, the\r\nrelative number of the two sexes, the earlier emergence of the males,\r\nthe laws of inheritance, etc. What an admirable illustration you give of\r\nthe transference of characters acquired by one sex--namely, that of the\r\nmale of Bombus possessing the pollen-collecting apparatus. Many of\r\nyour facts about the differences between male and female bees are\r\nsurprisingly parallel with those which occur with birds. The reading\r\nyour essay has given me great confidence in the efficacy of sexual\r\nselection, and I wanted some encouragement, as extremely few naturalists\r\nin England seem inclined to believe in it. I am, however, glad to find\r\nthat Prof. Weismann has some faith in this principle.\r\n\r\nThe males of Bombus follow one remarkable habit, which I think it would\r\ninterest you to investigate this coming summer, and no one could do\r\nit better than you. (462/2. Mr. Darwin's observations on this curious\r\nsubject were sent to Hermann Muller, and after his death were translated\r\nand published in Krause's \"Gesammelte kleinere Schriften von Charles\r\nDarwin,\" 1887, page 84. The male bees had certain regular lines of\r\nflight at Down, as from the end of the kitchen garden to the corner of\r\nthe \"sand-walk,\" and certain regular \"buzzing places\" where they stopped\r\non the wing for a moment or two. Mr. Darwin's children remember vividly\r\nthe pleasure of helping in the investigation of this habit.) I have\r\ntherefore enclosed a briefly and roughly drawn-up account of this habit.\r\nShould you succeed in making any observations on this subject, and if\r\nyou would like to use in any way my MS. you are perfectly welcome. I\r\ncould, should you hereafter wish to make any use of the facts, give them\r\nin rather fuller detail; but I think that I have given enough.\r\n\r\nI hope that you may long have health, leisure, and inclination to do\r\nmuch more work as excellent as your recent essay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.VIII.III. EXPRESSION, 1868-1874.\r\n\r\nLETTER 463. TO F. MULLER. Down, January 30th [1868].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your answers, though few in number (October\r\n5th), about expression. I was especially glad to hear about shrugging\r\nthe shoulders. You say that an old negro woman, when expressing\r\nastonishment, wonderfully resembled a Cebus when astonished; but are you\r\nsure that the Cebus opened its mouth? I ask because the Chimpanzee does\r\nnot open its mouth when astonished, or when listening. (463/1. Darwin\r\nin the \"Expression of the Emotions,\" adheres to this statement as being\r\ntrue of monkeys in general.) Please have the kindness to remember that\r\nI am very anxious to know whether any monkey, when screaming violently,\r\npartially or wholly closes its eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 464. TO W. BOWMAN.\r\n\r\n(464/1. The late Sir W. Bowman, the well-known surgeon, supplied a good\r\ndeal of information of value to Darwin in regard to the expression of\r\nthe emotions. The gorging of the eyes with blood during screaming is\r\nan important factor in the physiology of weeping, and indirectly in the\r\nobliquity of the eyebrows--a characteristic expression of suffering. See\r\n\"Expression of the Emotions,\" pages 160 and 192.)\r\n\r\nDown, March 30th [1868].\r\n\r\nI called at your house about three weeks since, and heard that you were\r\naway for the whole month, which I much regretted, as I wished to\r\nhave had the pleasure of seeing you, of asking you a question, and\r\nof thanking you for your kindness to my son George. You did not quite\r\nunderstand the last note which I wrote to you--viz., about Bell's\r\nprecise statement that the conjunctiva of an infant or young child\r\nbecomes gorged with blood when the eyes are forcibly opened during\r\na screaming fit. (464/2. Sir C. Bell's statement in his \"Anatomy\r\nof Expression\" (1844, page 106) is quoted in the \"Expression of the\r\nEmotions,\" page 158.) I have carefully kept your previous note, in which\r\nyou spoke doubtfully about Bell's statement. I intended in my former\r\nnote only to express a wish that if, during your professional work, you\r\nwere led to open the eyelids of a screaming child, you would specially\r\nobserve this point about the eye showing signs of becoming gorged with\r\nblood, which interests me extremely. Could you ask any one to observe\r\nthis for me in an eye-dispensary or hospital? But I now have to beg you\r\nkindly to consider one other question at any time when you have half an\r\nhour's leisure.\r\n\r\nWhen a man coughs violently from choking or retches violently, even when\r\nhe yawns, and when he laughs violently, tears come into the eyes. Now,\r\nin all these cases I observe that the orbicularis muscle is more or less\r\nspasmodically contracted, as also in the crying of a child. So, again,\r\nwhen the muscles of the abdomen contract violently in a propelling\r\nmanner, and the breath is, I think, always held, as during the\r\nevacuation of a very costive man, and as (I hear) with a woman during\r\nsevere labour-pains, the orbicularis contracts, and tears come into\r\nthe eyes. Sir J.E. Tennant states that tears roll down the cheeks\r\nof elephants when screaming and trumpeting at first being captured;\r\naccordingly I went to the Zoological Gardens, and the keeper made two\r\nelephants trumpet, and when they did this violently the orbicularis was\r\ninvariably plainly contracted. Hence I am led to conclude that there\r\nmust be some relation between the contraction of this muscle and the\r\nsecretion of tears. Can you tell me what this relation is? Does the\r\norbicularis press against, and so directly stimulate, the lachrymal\r\ngland? As a slight blow on the eye causes, by reflex action, a\r\ncopious effusion of tears, can the slight spasmodic contraction of the\r\norbicularis act like a blow? This seems hardly possible. Does the same\r\nnerve which runs to the orbicularis send off fibrils to the lachrymal\r\nglands; and if so, when the order goes for the muscle to contract,\r\nis nervous force sent sympathetically at the same time to the glands?\r\n(464/3. See \"Expression of the Emotions,\" page 169.)\r\n\r\nI should be extremely much obliged if you [would] have the kindness to\r\ngive me your opinion on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 465. TO F.C. DONDERS.\r\n\r\n(465/1. Mr. Darwin was indebted to Sir W. Bowman for an introduction to\r\nProfessor Donders, whose work on Sir Charles Bell's views is quoted in\r\nthe \"Expression of the Emotions,\" pages 160-62.)\r\n\r\nDown, June 3rd [1870?].\r\n\r\nI do not know how to thank you enough for the very great trouble which\r\nyou have taken in writing at such length, and for your kind expressions\r\ntowards me. I am particularly obliged for the abstract with respect to\r\nSir C. Bell's views (465/2. See \"Expression of the Emotions,\" pages 158\r\net seq.: Sir Charles Bell's view is that adopted by Darwin--viz. that\r\nthe contraction of the muscles round the eyes counteracts the gorging of\r\nthe parts during screaming, etc. The essay of Donders is, no doubt,\r\n\"On the Action of the Eyelids in Determination of Blood from Expiratory\r\nEffort\" in Beale's \"Archives of Medicine,\" Volume V., 1870, page 20,\r\nwhich is a translation of the original in Dutch.), as I shall now\r\nproceed with some confidence; but I am intensely curious to read your\r\nessay in full when translated and published, as I hope, in the \"Dublin\r\nJournal,\" as you speak of the weak point in the case--viz., that\r\ninjuries are not known to follow from the gorging of the eye with blood.\r\nI may mention that my son and his friend at a military academy tell me\r\nthat when they perform certain feats with their heads downwards their\r\nfaces become purple and veins distended, and that they then feel an\r\nuncomfortable sensation in their eyes; but that as it is necessary for\r\nthem to see, they cannot protect their eyes by closing the eyelids. The\r\ncompanions of one young man, who naturally has very prominent eyes, used\r\nto laugh at him when performing such feats, and declare that some day\r\nboth eyes would start out of his head.\r\n\r\nYour essay on the physiological and anatomical relations between the\r\ncontraction of the orbicular muscles and the secretion of tears is\r\nwonderfully clear, and has interested me greatly. I had not thought\r\nabout irritating substances getting into the nose during vomiting; but\r\nmy clear impression is that mere retching causes tears. I will, however,\r\ntry to get this point ascertained. When I reflect that in vomiting\r\n(subject to the above doubt), in violent coughing from choking, in\r\nyawning, violent laughter, in the violent downward action of the\r\nabdominal muscle...and in your very curious case of the spasms (465/3.\r\nIn some cases a slight touch to the eye causes spasms of the orbicularis\r\nmuscle, which may continue for so long as an hour, being accompanied by\r\na flow of tears. See \"Expression of the Emotions,\" page 166.)--that in\r\nall these cases the orbicular muscles are strongly and unconsciously\r\ncontracted, and that at the same time tears often certainly flow, I must\r\nthink that there is a connection of some kind between these phenomena;\r\nbut you have clearly shown me that the nature of the relation is at\r\npresent quite obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 466. TO A.D. BARTLETT. 6, Queen Anne Street, W., December 19th\r\n[1870?].\r\n\r\nI was with Mr. Wood this morning, and he expressed himself strongly\r\nabout your and your daughter's kindness in aiding him. He much wants\r\nassistance on another point, and if you would aid him, you would greatly\r\noblige me. You know well the appearance of a dog when approaching\r\nanother dog with hostile intentions, before they come close together.\r\nThe dog walks very stiffly, with tail rigid and upright, hair on back\r\nerected, ears pointed and eyes directed forwards. When the dog attacks\r\nthe other, down go the ears, and the canines are uncovered. Now, could\r\nyou anyhow arrange so that one of your dogs could see a strange dog from\r\na little distance, so that Mr. Wood could sketch the former attitude,\r\nviz., of the stiff gesture with erected hair and erected ears. (466/1.\r\nIn Chapter II. of the \"Expression of the Emotions\" there are sketches\r\nof dogs in illustration of the \"Principle of Antithesis,\" drawn by Mr.\r\nRiviere and by Mr. A. May (figures 5-8). Mr. T.W. Wood supplied similar\r\ndrawings of a cat (figures 9, 10), also a sketch of the head of a\r\nsnarling dog (figure 14).) And then he could afterwards sketch the same\r\ndog, when fondled by his master and wagging his tail with drooping ears.\r\nThese two sketches I want much, and it would be a great favour to Mr.\r\nWood, and myself, if you could aid him.\r\n\r\nP.S.--When a horse is turned out into a field he trots with high,\r\nelastic steps, and carries his tail aloft. Even when a cow frisks about\r\nshe throws up her tail. I have seen a drawing of an elephant, apparently\r\ntrotting with high steps, and with the tail erect. When the elephants in\r\nthe garden are turned out and are excited so as to move quickly, do they\r\ncarry their tails aloft? How is this with the rhinoceros? Do not trouble\r\nyourself to answer this, but I shall be in London in a couple of months,\r\nand then perhaps you will be able to answer this trifling question. Or,\r\nif you write about wolves and jackals turning round, you can tell me\r\nabout the tails of elephants, or of any other animals. (466/2. In the\r\n\"Expression of the Emotions,\" page 44, reference is made under the head\r\nof \"Associated habitual movements in the lower animals,\" to dogs and\r\nother animals turning round and round and scratching the ground with\r\ntheir fore-paws when they wish to go to sleep on a carpet, or other\r\nsimilar surface.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 467. TO A.D. BARTLETT. Down, January 5th, [1871?]\r\n\r\nMany thanks about Limulus. I am going to ask another favour, but I do\r\nnot want to trouble you to answer it by letter. When the Callithrix\r\nsciureus screams violently, does it wrinkle up the skin round the eyes\r\nlike a baby always does? (467/1. \"Humboldt also asserts that the eyes\r\nof the Callithrix sciureus 'instantly fill with tears when it is seized\r\nwith fear'; but when this pretty little monkey in the Zoological Gardens\r\nwas teased, so as to cry out loudly, this did not occur. I do not,\r\nhowever, wish to throw the least doubt on the accuracy of Humboldt's\r\nstatement.\" (\"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals,\"\r\n1872, page 137.) When thus screaming do the eyes become suffused with\r\nmoisture? Will you ask Sutton to observe carefully? (467/2. One of the\r\nkeepers who made many observations on monkeys for Mr. Darwin.) Could you\r\nmake it scream without hurting it much? I should be truly obliged some\r\ntime for this information, when in spring I come to the Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 468. TO W. OGLE. Down, March 7th [1871].\r\n\r\nI wrote to Tyndall, but had no clear answer, and have now written to\r\nhim again about odours. (468/1. Dr. Ogle's work on the Sense of Smell\r\n(\"Medico-Chirurgical Trans.\" LIII., page 268) is referred to in the\r\n\"Expression of the Emotions,\" page 256.) I write now to ask you to be so\r\nkind (if there is no objection) to tell me the circumstances under which\r\nyou saw a man arrested for murder. (468/2. Given in the \"Expression of\r\nthe Emotions,\" page 294.) I say in my notes made from your conversation:\r\nutmost horror--extreme pallor--mouth relaxed and open--general\r\nprostration--perspiration--muscle of face contracted--hair observed on\r\naccount of having been dyed, and apparently not erected. Secondly, may\r\nI quote you that you have often (?) seen persons (young or old? men\r\nor women?) who, evincing no great fear, were about to undergo severe\r\noperation under chloroform, showing resignation by (alternately?)\r\nfolding one open hand over the other on the lower part of chest (whilst\r\nrecumbent?)--I know this expression, and think I ought to notice it.\r\nCould you look out for an additional instance?\r\n\r\nI fear you will think me very troublesome, especially when I remind you\r\n(not that I am in a hurry) about the Eustachian tube.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 469. TO J. JENNER WEIR. Down, June 14th [1870].\r\n\r\nAs usual, I am going to beg for information. Can you tell me whether\r\nany Fringillidae or Sylviadae erect their feathers when frightened or\r\nenraged? (469/1. See \"Expression of the Emotions,\" page 99.) I want to\r\nshow that this expression is common to all or most of the families of\r\nbirds. I know of this only in the fowl, swan, tropic-bird, owl, ruff and\r\nreeve, and cuckoo. I fancy that I remember having seen nestling birds\r\nerect their feathers greatly when looking into nests, as is said to\r\nbe the case with young cuckoos. I should much like to know whether\r\nnestlings do really thus erect their feathers. I am now at work on\r\nexpression in animals of all kinds, and birds; and if you have any hints\r\nI should be very glad for them, and you have a rich wealth of facts of\r\nall kinds. Any cases like the following: the sheldrake pats or dances on\r\nthe tidal sands to make the sea-worms come out; and when Mr. St. John's\r\ntame sheldrakes came to ask for their dinners they used to pat the\r\nground, and this I should call an expression of hunger and impatience.\r\nHow about the Quagga case? (469/2. See Letter 235, Volume I.)\r\n\r\nI am working away as hard as I can on my book; but good heavens, how\r\nslow my progress is.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 470. TO F.C. DONDERS. Down, March 18th, 1871.\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your kind letter. I have been interested by what\r\nyou tell me about your views published in 1848, and I wish I could\r\nread your essay. It is clear to me that you were as near as possible in\r\npreceding me on the subject of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nYou will find very little that is new to you in my last book; whatever\r\nmerit it may possess consists in the grouping of the facts and in\r\ndeductions from them. I am now at work on my essay on Expression.\r\nMy last book fatigued me much, and I have had much correspondence,\r\notherwise I should have written to you long ago, as I often intended to\r\ntell you in how high a degree your essay published in Beale's Archives\r\ninterested me. (470/1. Beale's \"Archives of Medicine,\" Volume V., 1870.)\r\nI have heard others express their admiration at the complete manner in\r\nwhich you have treated the subject. Your confirmation of Sir C. Bell's\r\nrather loose statement has been of paramount importance for my work.\r\n(470/2. On the contraction of the muscles surrounding the eye. See\r\n\"Expression of the Emotions,\" page 158. See Letters 464, 465.) You told\r\nme that I might make further enquiries from you.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is lost in meditation his eyes often appear as if fixed\r\non a distant object (470/3. The appearance is due to divergence of the\r\nlines of vision produced by muscular relaxation. See \"Expression of the\r\nEmotions,\" Edition II., page 239.), and the lower eyelids may be seen to\r\ncontract and become wrinkled. I suppose the idea is quite fanciful, but\r\nas you say that the eyeball advances in adaptation for vision for close\r\nobjects, would the eyeball have to be pushed backwards in adaptation for\r\ndistant objects? (470/4. Darwin seems to have misunderstood a remark of\r\nDonders.) If so, can the wrinkling of the lower eyelids, which has often\r\nperplexed me, act in pushing back the eyeball?\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, I daresay this is quite fanciful. Gratiolet says\r\nthat the pupil contracts in rage, and dilates enormously in terror.\r\n(470/5. See \"Expression of the Emotions,\" Edition II., page 321.) I have\r\nnot found this great anatomist quite trustworthy on such points, and am\r\nmaking enquiries on this subject. But I am inclined to believe him, as\r\nthe old Scotch anatomist Munro says, that the iris of parrots contracts\r\nand dilates under passions, independently of the amount of light. Can\r\nyou give any explanation of this statement? When the heart beats hard\r\nand quick, and the head becomes somewhat congested with blood in any\r\nillness, does the pupil contract? Does the pupil dilate in incipient\r\nfaintness, or in utter prostration, as when after a severe race a man\r\nis pallid, bathed in perspiration, with all his muscles quivering? Or in\r\nextreme prostration from any illness?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 471. TO W. TURNER. Down, March 28th [1871].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your kind note, and especially for your offer of\r\nsending me some time corrections, for which I shall be truly grateful. I\r\nknow that there are many blunders to which I am very liable. There is\r\na terrible one confusing the supra-condyloid foramen with another one.\r\n(471/1. In the first edition of the \"Descent of Man,\" I., page 28,\r\nin quoting Mr. Busk \"On the Caves of Gibraltar,\" Mr. Darwin confuses\r\ntogether the inter-condyloid foramen in the humerus with the\r\nsupra-condyloid foramen. His attention was called to the mistake by\r\nSir William Turner, to whom he had been previously indebted for other\r\ninformation on the anatomy of man. The error is one, as Sir William\r\nTurner points out in a letter, \"which might easily arise where the\r\nwriter is not minutely acquainted with human anatomy.\" In speaking of\r\nhis correspondence with Darwin, Sir William remarks on a characteristic\r\nof Darwin's method of asking for information, namely, his care in\r\navoiding leading questions.) This, however, I have corrected in all the\r\ncopies struck off after the first lot of 2500. I daresay there will be\r\na new edition in the course of nine months or a year, and this I will\r\ncorrect as well as I can. As yet the publishers have kept up type,\r\nand grumble dreadfully if I make heavy corrections. I am very far from\r\nsurprised that \"you have not committed yourself to full acceptation\" of\r\nthe evolution of man. Difficulties and objections there undoubtedly are,\r\nenough and to spare, to stagger any cautious man who has much knowledge\r\nlike yourself.\r\n\r\nI am now at work at my hobby-horse essay on Expression, and I have been\r\nreading some old notes of yours. In one you say it is easy to see that\r\nthe spines of the hedgehog are moved by the voluntary panniculus. Now,\r\ncan you tell me whether each spine has likewise an oblique unstriped\r\nor striped muscle, as figured by Lister? (472/2. \"Expression of the\r\nEmotions,\" page 101.) Do you know whether the tail-coverts of peacock or\r\ntail of turkey are erected by unstriped or striped muscles, and whether\r\nthese are homologous with the panniculus or with the single oblique\r\nunstriped muscles going to each separate hair in man and many animals? I\r\nwrote some time ago to Kolliker to ask this question (and in relation to\r\nquills of porcupine), and I received a long and interesting letter, but\r\nhe could not answer these questions. If I do not receive any answer (for\r\nI know how busy you must be), I will understand you cannot aid me.\r\n\r\nI heard yesterday that Paget was very ill; I hope this is not true. What\r\na loss he would be; he is so charming a man.\r\n\r\nP.S.--As I am writing I will trouble you with one other question. Have\r\nyou seen anything or read of any facts which could induce you to think\r\nthat the mind being intently and long directed to any portion of\r\nthe skin (or, indeed, any organ) would influence the action of the\r\ncapillaries, causing them either to contract or dilate? Any information\r\non this head would be of great value to me, as bearing on blushing.\r\n\r\nIf I remember right, Paget seems to be a great believer in the influence\r\nof the mind in the nutrition of parts, and even in causing disease. It\r\nis awfully audacious on my part, but I remember thinking (with respect\r\nto the latter assertion on disease) when I read the passage that it\r\nseemed rather fanciful, though I should like to believe in it. Sir H.\r\nHolland alludes to this subject of the influence of the mind on local\r\ncirculation frequently, but gives no clear evidence. (472/3. Ibid.,\r\npages 339 et seq.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 472. TO W. TURNER. Down, March 29th [1871].\r\n\r\nForgive me for troubling you with one line. Since writing my P.S. I have\r\nread the part on the influence of the nervous system on the nutrition of\r\nparts in your last edition of Paget's \"Lectures.\" (472/1. \"Lectures on\r\nSurgical Pathology,\" Edition III., revised by Professor Turner, 1870.)\r\nI had not read before this part in this edition, and I see how foolish I\r\nwas. But still, I should be extremely grateful for any hint or\r\nevidence of the influence of mental attention on the capillary or\r\nlocal circulation of the skin, or of any part to which the mind may be\r\nintently and long directed. For instance, if thinking intently about a\r\nlocal eruption on the skin (not on the face, for shame might possibly\r\nintervene) caused it temporarily to redden, or thinking of a tumour\r\ncaused it to throb, independently of increased heart action.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 473. TO HUBERT AIRY.\r\n\r\n(473/1. Dr. Airy had written to Mr. Darwin on April 3rd:--\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the loss of voluntary movement of the ears in man and\r\nmonkey, may I ask if you do not think it might have been caused, as it\r\nis certainly compensated, by the facility and quickness in turning the\r\nhead, possessed by them in virtue of their more erect stature, and the\r\nfreedom of the atlanto-axial articulation? (in birds the same end is\r\ngained by the length and flexibility of the neck.) The importance, in\r\ncase of danger, of bringing the eyes to help the ears would call for a\r\nquick turn of the head whenever a new sound was heard, and so would tend\r\nto make superfluous any special means of moving the ears, except in the\r\ncase of quadrupeds and the like, that have great trouble (comparatively\r\nspeaking) in making a horizontal turn of the head--can only do it by a\r\nslow bend of the whole neck.\" (473/2. We are indebted to Dr. Airy for\r\nfurnishing us with a copy of his letter to Mr. Darwin, the original of\r\nwhich had been mislaid.)\r\n\r\nDown, April 5th [1871].\r\n\r\nI am greatly obliged for your letter. Your idea about the easy turning\r\nof the head instead of the ears themselves strikes me as very good, and\r\nquite new to me, and I will keep it in mind; but I fear that there are\r\nsome cases opposed to the notion.\r\n\r\nIf I remember right the hedgehog has very human ears, but birds support\r\nyour view, though lizards are opposed to it.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons have pointed out my error about the platysma. (473/3.\r\nThe error in question occurs on page 19 of the \"Descent of Man,\" Edition\r\nI., where it is stated that the Platysma myoides cannot be voluntarily\r\nbrought into action. In the \"Expression of the Emotions\" Darwin remarks\r\nthat this muscle is sometimes said not to be under voluntary control,\r\nand he shows that this is not universally true.) Nor can I remember how\r\nI was misled. I find I can act on this muscle myself, now that I know\r\nthe corners of the mouth have to be drawn back. I know of the case of a\r\nman who can act on this muscle on one side, but not on the other; yet\r\nhe asserts positively that both contract when he is startled. And this\r\nleads me to ask you to be so kind as to observe, if any opportunity\r\nshould occur, whether the platysma contracts during extreme terror,\r\nas before an operation; and secondly, whether it contracts during a\r\nshivering fit. Several persons are observing for me, but I receive most\r\ndiscordant results.\r\n\r\nI beg you to present my most respectful and kind compliments to your\r\nhonoured father [Sir G.B. Airy].\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 474. TO FRANCIS GALTON.\r\n\r\n(474/1. Mr. Galton had written on November 7th, 1872, offering to send\r\nto various parts of Africa Darwin's printed list of questions intended\r\nto guide observers on expression. Mr. Galton goes on: \"You do not,\r\nI think, mention in \"Expression\" what I thought was universal among\r\nblubbering children (when not trying to see if harm or help was coming\r\nout of the corner of one eye) of pressing the knuckles against the\r\neyeballs, thereby reinforcing the orbicularis.\")\r\n\r\nDown, November 8th [1872].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your note and offer to send out the queries; but my\r\ncareer is so nearly closed that I do not think it worth while. What\r\nlittle more I can do shall be chiefly new work. I ought to have thought\r\nof crying children rubbing their eyes with their knuckles, but I did not\r\nthink of it, and cannot explain it. As far as my memory serves, they do\r\nnot do so whilst roaring, in which case compression would be of use. I\r\nthink it is at the close of the crying fit, as if they wished to stop\r\ntheir eyes crying, or possibly to relieve the irritation from the salt\r\ntears. I wish I knew more about the knuckles and crying.\r\n\r\nWhat a tremendous stir-up your excellent article on prayer has made in\r\nEngland and America! (474/2. The article entitled \"Statistical Inquiries\r\ninto the Efficacy of Prayer\" appeared in the \"Fortnightly Review,\" 1872.\r\nIn Mr. Francis Galton's book on \"Enquiries into Human Faculty and its\r\nDevelopment,\" London, 1883, a section (pages 277-94) is devoted to a\r\ndiscussion on the \"Objective Efficacy of Prayer.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 475. TO F.C. DONDERS.\r\n\r\n(475/1. We have no means of knowing whether the observations suggested\r\nin the following letter were made--if not, the suggestion is worthy of\r\nrecord.)\r\n\r\nDown, December 21st, 1872.\r\n\r\nYou will have received some little time ago my book on Expression, in\r\nwriting which I was so deeply indebted to your kindness. I want now to\r\nbeg a favour of you, if you have the means to grant it. A clergyman, the\r\nhead of an institution for the blind in England (475/2. The Rev. R.H.\r\nBlair, Principal of the Worcester College: \"Expression of the Emotions,\"\r\nEdition II., page 237.), has been observing the expression of those born\r\nblind, and he informs me that they never or very rarely frown. He kept\r\na record of several cases, but at last observed a frown on two of the\r\nchildren who he thought never frowned; and then in a foolish manner tore\r\nup his notes, and did not write to me until my book was published. He\r\nmay be a bad observer and altogether mistaken, but I think it would\r\nbe worth while to ascertain whether those born blind, when young, and\r\nwhilst screaming violently, contract the muscles round the eyes like\r\nordinary infants. And secondly, whether in after years they rarely or\r\nnever frown. If it should prove true that infants born blind do not\r\ncontract their orbicular muscles whilst screaming (though I can hardly\r\nbelieve it) it would be interesting to know whether they shed tears as\r\ncopiously as other children. The nature of the affection which causes\r\nblindness may possibly influence the contraction of the muscles, but on\r\nall such points you will judge infinitely better than I can. Perhaps you\r\ncould get some trustworthy superintendent of an asylum for the blind to\r\nattend to this subject. I am sure that you will forgive me asking this\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 476. TO D. HACK TUKE. Down, December 22nd, 1872.\r\n\r\nI have now finished your book, and have read it with great interest.\r\n(476/1. \"Influence of the Mind upon the Body. Designed to elucidate the\r\nPower of the Imagination.\" 1872.)\r\n\r\nMany of your cases are very striking. As I felt sure would be the case,\r\nI have learnt much from it; and I should have modified several passages\r\nin my book on Expression, if I had had the advantage of reading your\r\nwork before my publication. I always felt, and said so a year ago to\r\nProfessor Donders, that I had not sufficient knowledge of Physiology to\r\ntreat my subject in a proper way.\r\n\r\nWith many thanks for the interest which I have felt in reading your\r\nwork...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 477. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, January 10th [1873].\r\n\r\nI have read your Review with much interest, and I thank you sincerely\r\nfor the very kind spirit in which it is written. I cannot say that I am\r\nconvinced by your criticisms. (477/1. \"Quarterly Journal of Science,\"\r\nJanuary, 1873, page 116: \"I can hardly believe that when a cat, lying\r\non a shawl or other soft material, pats or pounds it with its feet, or\r\nsometimes sucks a piece of it, it is the persistence of the habit of\r\npressing the mammary glands and sucking during kittenhood.\" Mr. Wallace\r\ngoes on to say that infantine habits are generally completely lost in\r\nadult life, and that it seems unlikely that they should persist in a few\r\nisolated instances.) If you have ever actually observed a kitten sucking\r\nand pounding, with extended toes, its mother, and then seen the same\r\nkitten when a little older doing the same thing on a soft shawl, and\r\nultimately an old cat (as I have seen), and do not admit that it is\r\nidentically the same action, I am astonished. With respect to the\r\ndecapitated frog, I have always heard of Pfluger as a most trustworthy\r\nobserver. (477/2. Mr. Wallace speaks of \"a readiness to accept the most\r\nmarvellous conclusions or interpretations of physiologists on what\r\nseem very insufficient grounds,\" and he goes on to assert that the frog\r\nexperiment is either incorrectly recorded or else that it \"demonstrates\r\nvolition, and not reflex action.\") If, indeed, any one knows a frog's\r\nhabits so well as to say that it never rubs off a bit of leaf or other\r\nobject which may stick to its thigh, in the same manner as it did the\r\nacid, your objection would be valid. Some of Flourens' experiments, in\r\nwhich he removed the cerebral hemispheres from a pigeon, indicate that\r\nacts apparently performed consciously can be done without consciousness.\r\nI presume through the force of habit, in which case it would appear that\r\nintellectual power is not brought into play. Several persons have made\r\nsuggestions and objections as yours about the hands being held up\r\nin astonishment; if there was any straining of the muscles, as with\r\nprotruded arms under fright, I would agree; as it is I must keep to\r\nmy old opinion, and I dare say you will say that I am an obstinate old\r\nblockhead. (477/3. The raising of the hands in surprise is explained\r\n(\"Expression of Emotions,\" Edition I., page 287) on the doctrine of\r\nantithesis as being the opposite of listlessness. Mr. Wallace's view\r\n(given in the 2nd edition of \"Expression of the Emotions,\" page 300) is\r\nthat the gesture is appropriate to sudden defence or to the giving of\r\naid to another person.)\r\n\r\nThe book has sold wonderfully; 9,000 copies have now been printed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 478. TO CHAUNCEY WRIGHT. Down, September 21st, 1874.\r\n\r\nI have read your long letter with the greatest interest, and it was\r\nextremely kind of you to take such great trouble. Now that you call my\r\nattention to the fact, I well know the appearance of persons moving\r\nthe head from side to side when critically viewing any object; and I am\r\nalmost sure that I have seen the same gesture in an affected person when\r\nspeaking in exaggerated terms of some beautiful object not present.\r\nI should think your explanation of this gesture was the true one. But\r\nthere seems to me a rather wide difference between inclining or moving\r\nthe head laterally, and moving it in the same plane, as we do in\r\nnegation, and, as you truly add, in disapprobation. It may, however, be\r\nthat these two movements of the head have been confounded by travellers\r\nwhen speaking of the Turks. Perhaps Prof. Lowell would remember whether\r\nthe movement was identically the same. Your remarks on the effects of\r\nviewing a sunset, etc., with the head inverted are very curious. (478/1.\r\nThe letter dated September 3rd, 1874, is published in Mr. Thayer's\r\n\"Letters\" of Chauncey Wright, privately printed, Cambridge, Mass., 1878.\r\nWright quotes Mr. Sophocles, a native of Greece, at the time Professor\r\nof Modern and Ancient Greek at Harvard University, to the effect that\r\nthe Turks do not express affirmation by a shake of the head, but by a\r\nbow or grave nod, negation being expressed by a backward nod. From\r\nthe striking effect produced by looking at a landscape with the head\r\ninverted, or by looking at its reflection, Chauncey Wright was led to\r\nthe lateral movement of the head, which is characteristic of critical\r\ninspection--eg. of a picture. He thinks that in this way a gesture of\r\ndeliberative assent arose which may have been confused with our ordinary\r\nsign of negation. He thus attempts to account for the contradictions\r\nbetween Lieber's statement that a Turk or Greek expresses \"yes\" by a\r\nshake of the head, and the opposite opinion of Prof. Sophocles, and\r\nlastly, Mr. Lowell's assertion that in Italy our negative shake of the\r\nhead is used in affirmation (see \"Expression of the Emotions,\" Edition\r\nII., page 289).) We have a looking-glass in the drawing-room opposite\r\nthe flower-garden, and I have often been struck how extremely pretty\r\nand strange the flower garden and surrounding bushes appear when thus\r\nviewed. Your letter will be very useful to me for a new edition of my\r\nExpression book; but this will not be for a long time, if ever, as the\r\npublisher was misled by the very large sale at first, and printed far\r\ntoo many copies.\r\n\r\nI daresay you intend to publish your views in some essay, and I think\r\nyou ought to do so, for you might make an interesting and instructive\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nI have been half killing myself of late with microscopical work on\r\nplants. I begin to think that they are more wonderful than animals.\r\n\r\nP.S., January 29th, 1875.--You will see that by a stupid mistake in\r\nthe address this letter has just been returned to me. It is by no\r\nmeans worth forwarding, but I cannot bear that you should think me\r\nso ungracious and ungrateful as not to have thanked you for your long\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nAs I forget whether \"Cambridge\" is sufficient address, I will send this\r\nthrough Asa Gray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: CHARLES LYELL.

TO DAVID MILNE. 12, Upper Gower Street, Thursday [March]\r\n20th [1840].\r\n\r\nI much regret that I am unable to give you any information of the kind\r\nyou desire. You must have misunderstood Mr. Lyell concerning the object\r\nof my paper. (479/1. \"On the Connexion of certain Volcanic Phenomena,\r\nand on the Formation of Mountain-chains and the Effects of Continental\r\nElevations.\" \"Trans. Geol. Soc.\" Volume V., 1840, pages 601-32 [March\r\n7th, 1838].) It is an account of the shock of February, 1835, in Chile,\r\nwhich is particularly interesting, as it ties most closely together\r\nvolcanic eruptions and continental elevations. In that paper I notice a\r\nvery remarkable coincidence in volcanic eruptions in S. America at very\r\ndistant places. I have also drawn up some short tables showing, as\r\nit appears to me, that there are periods of unusually great volcanic\r\nactivity affecting large portions of S. America. I have no record of any\r\ncoincidences between shocks there and in Europe. Humboldt, by his table\r\nin the \"Pers. Narrative\" (Volume IV., page 36, English Translation),\r\nseems to consider the elevation of Sabrina off the Azores as connected\r\nwith S. American subterranean activity: this connection appears to be\r\nexceedingly vague. I have during the past year seen it stated that a\r\nsevere shock in the northern parts of S. America coincided with one\r\nin Kamstchatka. Believing, then, that such coincidences are purely\r\naccidental, I neglected to take a note of the reference; but I\r\nbelieve the statement was somewhere in \"L'Institut\" for 1839. (479/2.\r\n\"L'Institut, Journal General des Societes et Travaux Scientifiques de la\r\nFrance et de l'Etranger,\" Tome VIII. page 412, Paris, 1840. In a note\r\non some earthquakes in the province Maurienne it is stated that they\r\noccurred during a change in the weather, and at times when a south wind\r\nfollowed a north wind, etc.) I was myself anxious to see the list of the\r\n1200 shocks alluded to by you, but I have not been able to find out that\r\nthe list has been published. With respect to any coincidences you may\r\ndiscover between shocks in S. America and Europe, let me venture to\r\nsuggest to you that it is probably a quite accurate statement that\r\nscarcely one hour in the year elapses in S. America without an\r\naccompanying shock in some part of that large continent. There are many\r\nregions in which earthquakes take place every three and four days; and\r\nafter the severer shocks the ground trembles almost half-hourly for\r\nmonths. If, therefore, you had a list of the earthquakes of two or\r\nthree of these districts, it is almost certain that some of them would\r\ncoincide with those in Scotland, without any other connection than mere\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nMy paper will be published immediately in the \"Geological Transactions,\"\r\nand I will do myself the pleasure of sending you a copy in the course of\r\n(as I hope) a week or ten days. A large part of it is theoretical, and\r\nwill be of little interest to you; but the account of the Concepcion\r\nshock of 1835 will, I think, be worth your perusal. I have understood\r\nfrom Mr. Lyell that you believe in some connection between the state of\r\nthe weather and earthquakes. Under the very peculiar climate of Northern\r\nChile, the belief of the inhabitants in such connection can hardly, in\r\nmy opinion, be founded in error. It must possibly be worth your while to\r\nturn to pages 430-433 in my \"Journal of Researches during the Voyage of\r\nthe 'Beagle',\" where I have stated this circumstance. (479/3. \"Journal\r\nof Researches into the Natural History and Geology of the Countries\r\nvisited during the Voyage of H.M.S. 'Beagle' round the World.\" London,\r\n1870, page 351.) On the hypothesis of the crust of the earth resting on\r\nfluid matter, would the influence of the moon (as indexed by the tides)\r\naffect the periods of the shocks, when the force which causes them is\r\njust balanced by the resistance of the solid crust? The fact you mention\r\nof the coincidence between the earthquakes of Calabria and Scotland\r\nappears most curious. Your paper will possess a high degree of interest\r\nto all geologists. I fancied that such uniformity of action, as seems\r\nhere indicated, was probably confined to large continents, such as the\r\nAmericas. How interesting a record of volcanic phenomena in Iceland\r\nwould be, now that you are collecting accounts of every slight trembling\r\nin Scotland. I am astonished at their frequency in that quiet country,\r\nas any one would have called it. I wish it had been in my power to\r\nhave contributed in any way to your researches on this most interesting\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 480. TO L. HORNER. Down, August 29th [1844].\r\n\r\nI am greatly obliged for your kind note, and much pleased with its\r\ncontents. If one-third of what you say be really true, and not the\r\nverdict of a partial judge (as from pleasant experience I much suspect),\r\nthen should I be thoroughly well contented with my small volume which,\r\nsmall as it is, cost me much time. (480/1. \"Geological Observations\r\non the Volcanic Islands visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. 'Beagle'\":\r\nLondon, 1844. A French translation has been made by Professor Renard\r\nof Ghent, and published by Reinwald of Paris in 1902.) The pleasure\r\nof observation amply repays itself: not so that of composition; and it\r\nrequires the hope of some small degree of utility in the end to make up\r\nfor the drudgery of altering bad English into sometimes a little better\r\nand sometimes worse. With respect to craters of elevation (480/2.\r\n\"Geological Observations,\" pages 93-6.), I had no sooner printed off\r\nthe few pages on that subject than I wished the whole erased. I utterly\r\ndisbelieve in Von Buch and de Beaumont's views; but on the other\r\nhand, in the case of the Mauritius and St. Jago, I cannot, perhaps\r\nunphilosophically, persuade myself that they are merely the basal\r\nfragments of ordinary volcanoes; and therefore I thought I would suggest\r\nthe notion of a slow circumferential elevation, the central part\r\nbeing left unelevated, owing to the force from below being spent\r\nand [relieved?] in eruptions. On this view, I do not consider these\r\nso-called craters of elevation as formed by the ejection of ashes,\r\nlava, etc., etc., but by a peculiar kind of elevation acting round and\r\nmodified by a volcanic orifice. I wish I had left it all out; I trust\r\nthat there are in other parts of the volume more facts and less theory.\r\nThe more I reflect on volcanoes, the more I appreciate the importance\r\nof E. de Beaumont's measurements (480/3. Elie de Beaumont's views are\r\ndiscussed by Sir Charles Lyell both in the \"Principles of Geology\"\r\n(Edition X., 1867, Volume I. pages 633 et seq.) and in the \"Elements\r\nof Geology\" (Edition III., 1878, pages 495, 496). See also Darwin's\r\n\"Geological Observations,\" Edition II., 1876, page 107.) (even if\r\none does not believe them implicitly) of the natural inclination of\r\nlava-streams, and even more the importance of his view of the dikes,\r\nor unfilled fissures, in every volcanic mountain, being the proofs\r\nand measures of the stretching and consequent elevation which all\r\nsuch mountains must have undergone. I believe he thus unintentionally\r\nexplains most of his cases of lava-streams being inclined at a greater\r\nangle than that at which they could have flowed.\r\n\r\nBut excuse this lengthy note, and once more let me thank you for the\r\npleasure and encouragement you have given me--which, together with\r\nLyell's never-failing kindness, will help me on with South America, and,\r\nas my books will not sell, I sometimes want such aid. I have been lately\r\nreading with care A. d'Orbigny's work on South America (480/4. \"Voyage\r\ndans l'Amerique Meridionale--execute pendant les annees 1826-33\": six\r\nvolumes, Paris, 1835-43.), and I cannot say how forcibly impressed I am\r\nwith the infinite superiority of the Lyellian school of Geology over\r\nthe continental. I always feel as if my books came half out of Lyell's\r\nbrain, and that I never acknowledge this sufficiently; nor do I know how\r\nI can without saying so in so many words--for I have always thought that\r\nthe great merit of the \"Principles\" was that it altered the whole tone\r\nof one's mind, and therefore that, when seeing a thing never seen by\r\nLyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes--it would have been in\r\nsome respects better if I had done this less: but again excuse my long,\r\nand perhaps you will think presumptuous, discussion. Enclosed is a note\r\nfrom Emma to Mrs. Horner, to beg you, if you can, to give us the great\r\npleasure of seeing you here. We are necessarily dull here, and can offer\r\nno amusements; but the weather is delightful, and if you could see how\r\nbrightly the sun now shines you would be tempted to come. Pray remember\r\nme most kindly to all your family, and beg of them to accept our\r\nproposal, and give us the pleasure of seeing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 481. TO C. LYELL. Down, [September, 1844].\r\n\r\nI was glad to get your note, and wanted to hear about your work. I\r\nhave been looking to see it advertised; it has been a long task. I had,\r\nbefore your return from Scotland, determined to come up and see you; but\r\nas I had nothing else to do in town, my courage has gradually eased\r\noff, more especially as I have not been very well lately. We get so many\r\ninvitations here that we are grown quite dissipated, but my stomach has\r\nstood it so ill that we are going to have a month's holidays, and go\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\nThe subject which I was most anxious to talk over with you I have\r\nsettled, and having written sixty pages of my \"S. American Geology,\" I\r\nam in pretty good heart, and am determined to have very little theory\r\nand only short descriptions. The two first chapters will, I think, be\r\npretty good, on the great gravel terraces and plains of Patagonia and\r\nChili and Peru.\r\n\r\nI am astonished and grieved over D'Orbigny's nonsense of sudden\r\nelevations. (481/1. D'Orbigny's views are referred to by Lyell in\r\nchapter vii. of the \"Principles,\" Volume I. page 131. \"This mud [i.e.\r\nthe Pampean mud] contains in it recent species of shells, some of them\r\nproper to brackish water, and is believed by Mr. Darwin to be an\r\nestuary or delta deposit. M.A. D'Orbigny, however, has advanced an\r\nhypothesis...that the agitation and displacement of the waters of the\r\nocean, caused by the elevation of the Andes, gave rise to a deluge, of\r\nwhich this Pampean mud, which reaches sometimes the height of 12,000\r\nfeet, is the result and monument.\") I must give you one of his cases:\r\nHe finds an old beach 600 feet above sea. He finds STILL ATTACHED to the\r\nrocks at 300 feet six species of truly littoral shells. He finds at 20\r\nto 30 feet above sea an immense accumulation of chiefly littoral shells.\r\nHe argues the whole 600 feet uplifted at one blow, because the attached\r\nshells at 300 feet have not been displaced. Therefore when the sea\r\nformed a beach at 600 feet the present littoral shells were attached\r\nto rocks at 300 feet depth, and these same shells were accumulating by\r\nthousands at 600 feet.\r\n\r\nHear this, oh Forbes. Is it not monstrous for a professed conchologist?\r\nThis is a fair specimen of his reasoning.\r\n\r\nOne of his arguments against the Pampas being a slow deposit, is that\r\nmammifers are very seldom washed by rivers into the sea!\r\n\r\nBecause at 12,000 feet he finds the same kind of clay with that of\r\nthe Pampas he never doubts that it is contemporaneous with the Pampas\r\n[debacle?] which accompanied the right royal salute of every volcano\r\nin the Cordillera. What a pity these Frenchmen do not catch hold of\r\na comet, and return to the good old geological dramas of Burnett and\r\nWhiston. I shall keep out of controversy, and just give my own facts. It\r\nis enough to disgust one with Geology; though I have been much pleased\r\nwith the frank, decided, though courteous manner with which D'Orbigny\r\ndisputes my conclusions, given, unfortunately, without facts, and\r\nsometimes rashly, in my journal.\r\n\r\nEnough of S. America. I wish you would ask Mr. Horner (for I forgot to\r\ndo so, and am unwilling to trouble him again) whether he thinks there\r\nis too much detail (quite independent of the merits of the book) in my\r\nvolcanic volume; as to know this would be of some real use to me. You\r\ncould tell me when we meet after York, when I will come to town. I had\r\nintended being at York, but my courage has failed. I should much like\r\nto hear your lecture, but still more to read it, as I think reading is\r\nalways better than hearing.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you talk of a visit to us in the autumn if you can spare\r\nthe time. I shall be truly glad to see Mrs. Lyell and yourself here; but\r\nI have scruples in asking any one--you know how dull we are here. Young\r\nHooker (481/2. Sir J.D. Hooker.) talks of coming; I wish he might meet\r\nyou,--he appears to me a most engaging young man.\r\n\r\nI have been delighted with Prescott, of which I have read Volume I. at\r\nyour recommendation; I have just been a good deal interested with W.\r\nTaylor's (of Norwich) \"Life and Correspondence.\"\r\n\r\nOn your return from York I shall expect a great supply of Geological\r\ngossip.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 482. TO C. LYELL. [October 3rd, 1846.]\r\n\r\nI have been much interested with Ramsay, but have no particular\r\nsuggestions to offer (482/1. \"On the Denudation of South Wales and the\r\nAdjacent Counties of England.\" A.C. Ramsay, \"Mem. Geol. Survey Great\r\nBritain,\" Volume I., London, 1846.); I agree with all your remarks made\r\nthe other day. My final impression is that the only argument against\r\nhim is to tell him to read and re-read the \"Principles,\" and if not\r\nthen convinced to send him to Pluto. Not but what he has well read the\r\n\"Principles!\" and largely profited thereby. I know not how carefully you\r\nhave read this paper, but I think you did not mention to me that he does\r\n(page 327) (482/2. Ramsay refers the great outlines of the country to\r\nthe action of the sea in Tertiary times. In speaking of the denudation\r\nof the coast, he says: \"Taking UNLIMITED time into account, we can\r\nconceive that any extent of land might be so destroyed...If to this be\r\nadded an EXCEEDINGLY SLOW DEPRESSION of the land and sea bottom, the\r\nwasting process would be materially assisted by this depression\" (loc.\r\ncit., page 327).) believe that the main part of his great denudation\r\nwas effected during a vast (almost gratuitously assumed) slow Tertiary\r\nsubsidence and subsequent Tertiary oscillating slow elevation. So\r\nour high cliff argument is inapplicable. He seems to think his great\r\nsubsidence only FAVOURABLE for great denudation. I believe from\r\nthe general nature of the off-shore sea's bottoms that it is almost\r\nnecessary; do look at two pages--page 25 of my S. American volume--on\r\nthis subject. (482/3. \"Geological Observations on S. America,\" 1846,\r\npage 25. \"When viewing the sea-worn cliffs of Patagonia, in some parts\r\nbetween 800 and 900 feet in height, and formed of horizontal Tertiary\r\nstrata, which must once have extended far seaward...a difficulty often\r\noccurred to me, namely, how the strata could possibly have been removed\r\nby the action of the sea at a considerable depth beneath its surface.\"\r\nThe cliffs of St. Helena are referred to in illustration of the same\r\nproblem; speaking of these, Darwin adds: \"Now, if we had any reason\r\nto suppose that St. Helena had, during a long period, gone on slowly\r\nsubsiding, every difficulty would be removed...I am much inclined to\r\nsuspect that we shall hereafter find in all such cases that the land\r\nwith the adjoining bed of the sea has in truth subsided...\" (loc. cit.,\r\npages 25-6).)\r\n\r\nThe foundation of his views, viz., of one great sudden upheaval, strikes\r\nme as threefold. First, to account for the great dislocations. This\r\nstrikes me as the odder, as he admits that a little northwards there\r\nwere many and some violent dislocations at many periods during the\r\naccumulation of the Palaeozoic series. If you argue against him, allude\r\nto the cool assumption that petty forces are conflicting: look at\r\nvolcanoes; look at recurrent similar earthquakes at same spots; look at\r\nrepeatedly injected intrusive masses. In my paper on Volcanic Phenomena\r\nin the \"Geol. Transactions.\" (482/4. \"On the Connection of certain\r\nVolcanic Phenomena, and on the Formation of Mountain-chains and the\r\nEffects of Continental Elevations.\" \"Geol. Soc. Proc.\" Volume II., pages\r\n654-60, 1838; \"Trans. Geol. Soc.\" Volume V., pages 601-32, 1842. [Read\r\nMarch 7th, 1838.]) I have argued (and Lonsdale thought well of the\r\nargument, in favour, as he remarked, of your original doctrine) that if\r\nHopkins' views are correct, viz., that mountain chains are subordinate\r\nconsequences to changes of level in mass, then, as we have evidence of\r\nsuch horizontal movements in mass having been slow, the foundation of\r\nmountain chains (differing from volcanoes only in matter being injected\r\ninstead of ejected) must have been slow.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Ramsay has been influenced, I think, by his Alpine insects;\r\nbut he is wrong in thinking that there is any necessary connection\r\nof tropics and large insects--videlicet--Galapagos Arch., under the\r\nequator. Small insects swarm in all parts of tropics, though accompanied\r\ngenerally with large ones.\r\n\r\nThirdly, he appears influenced by the absence of newer deposits on the\r\nold area, blinded by the supposed necessity of sediment accumulating\r\nsomewhere near (as no doubt is true) and being PRESERVED--an example,\r\nas I think, of the common error which I wrote to you about. The\r\npreservation of sedimentary deposits being, as I do not doubt, the\r\nexception when they are accumulated during periods of elevation or of\r\nstationary level, and therefore the preservation of newer deposits would\r\nnot be probable, according to your view that Ramsay's great Palaeozoic\r\nmasses were denuded, whilst slowly rising. Do pray look at end of\r\nChapter II., at what little I have said on this subject in my S.\r\nAmerican volume. (482/5. The second chapter of the \"Geological\r\nObservations\" concludes with a Summary on the Recent Elevations of the\r\nWest Coast of South America, (page 53).)\r\n\r\nI do not think you can safely argue that the whole surface was probably\r\ndenuded at same time to the level of the lateral patches of Magnesian\r\nconglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the paper strikes me as good, but obvious.\r\n\r\nI shall send him my S. American volume for it is curious on how many\r\nsimilar points we enter, and I modestly hope it may be a half-oz. weight\r\ntowards his conversion to better views. If he would but reject his great\r\nsudden elevations, how sound and good he would be. I doubt whether this\r\nletter will be worth the reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 483. TO C. LYELL. Down [September 4th, 1849].\r\n\r\nIt was very good of you to write me so long a letter, which has\r\ninterested me much. I should have answered it sooner, but I have not\r\nbeen very well for the few last days. Your letter has also flattered\r\nme much in many points. I am very glad you have been thinking over the\r\nrelation of subsidence and the accumulation of deposits; it has to me\r\nremoved many great difficulties; please to observe that I have carefully\r\nabstained from saying that sediment is not deposited during periods of\r\nelevation, but only that it is not accumulated to sufficient thickness\r\nto withstand subsequent beach action; on both coasts of S. America the\r\namount of sediment deposited, worn away, and redeposited, oftentimes\r\nmust have been enormous, but still there have been no wide formations\r\nproduced: just read my discussion (page 135 of my S. American book\r\n(483/1. See Letter 556, note. The discussion referred to (\"Geological\r\nObservations on South America,\" 1846) deals with the causes of\r\nthe absence of recent conchiferous deposits on the coasts of South\r\nAmerica.)) again with this in your mind. I never thought of your\r\ndifficulty (i.e. in relation to this discussion) of where was the land\r\nwhence the three miles of S. Wales strata were derived! (483/2. In\r\nhis classical paper \"On the Denudation of South Wales and the Adjacent\r\nCounties of England\" (\"Mem. Geol. Survey,\" Volume I., page 297, 1846),\r\nRamsay estimates the thickness of certain Palaeozoic formations in South\r\nWales, and calculates the cubic contents of the strata in the area they\r\nnow occupy together with the amount removed by denudation; and he goes\r\non to say that it is evident that the quantity of matter employed to\r\nform these strata was many times greater than the entire amount of solid\r\nland they now represent above the waves. \"To form, therefore, so great\r\na thickness, a mass of matter of nearly equal cubic contents must have\r\nbeen worn by the waves and the outpourings of rivers from neighbouring\r\nlands, of which perhaps no original trace now remains\" (page 334.)) Do\r\nyou not think that it may be explained by a form of elevation which I\r\nhave always suspected to have been very common (and, indeed, had once\r\nintended getting all facts together), viz. thus?--\r\n\r\n(Figure 1. A line drawing of ocean bottom subsiding beside mountains and\r\ncontinent rising.)\r\n\r\nThe frequency of a DEEP ocean close to a rising continent bordered with\r\nmountains, seems to indicate these opposite movements of rising and\r\nsinking CLOSE TOGETHER; this would easily explain the S. Wales and\r\nEocene cases. I will only add that I should think there would be a\r\nlittle more sediment produced during subsidence than during elevation,\r\nfrom the resulting outline of coast, after long period of rise. There\r\nare many points in my volume which I should like to have discussed with\r\nyou, but I will not plague you: I should like to hear whether you think\r\nthere is anything in my conjecture on Craters of Elevation (483/3. In\r\nthe \"Geological Observations on Volcanic Islands,\" 1844, pages 93-6,\r\nDarwin speaks of St. Helena, St. Jago and Mauritius as being bounded by\r\na ring of basaltic mountains which he regards as \"Craters of Elevation.\"\r\nWhile unable to accept the theory of Elie de Beaumont and attribute\r\ntheir formation to a dome-shaped elevation and consequent arching of the\r\nstrata, he recognises a \"very great difficulty in admitting that these\r\nbasaltic mountains are merely the basal fragments of great volcanoes,\r\nof which the summits have been either blown off, or, more probably,\r\nswallowed by subsidence.\" An explanation of the origin and structure of\r\nthese volcanic islands is suggested which would keep them in the class\r\nof \"Craters of Elevation,\" but which assumes a slow elevation, during\r\nwhich the central hollow or platform having been formed \"not by the\r\narching of the surface, but simply by that part having been upraised to\r\na less height.\"); I cannot possibly believe that Saint Jago or Mauritius\r\nare the basal fragments of ordinary volcanoes; I would sooner even admit\r\nE. de Beaumont's views than that--much as I would sooner in my own mind\r\nin all cases follow you. Just look at page 232 in my \"S. America\" for a\r\ntrifling point, which, however, I remember to this day relieved my\r\nmind of a considerable difficulty. (483/4. This probably refers to\r\na paragraph (page 232) \"On the Eruptive Sources of the Porphyritic\r\nClaystone and Greenstone Lavas.\" The opinion is put forward that \"the\r\ndifficulty of tracing the streams of porphyries to their ancient and\r\ndoubtless numerous eruptive sources, may be partly explained by the very\r\ngeneral disturbance which the Cordillera in most parts has suffered\";\r\nbut, Darwin adds, \"a more specific cause may be that 'the original\r\npoints of eruption tend to become the points of injection'...On this\r\nview of there being a tendency in the old points of eruption to become\r\nthe points of subsequent injection and disturbance, and consequently of\r\ndenudation, it ceases to be surprising that the streams of lava in the\r\nporphyritic claystone conglomerate formation, and in other analogous\r\ncases, should most rarely be traceable to their actual sources.\" The\r\nlatter part of this letter is published in \"Life and Letters,\" I.,\r\npages 377, 378.) I remember being struck with your discussion on the\r\nMississippi beds in relation to Pampas, but I should wish to read them\r\nover again; I have, however, re-lent your work to Mrs. Rich, who, like\r\nall whom I have met, has been much interested by it. I will stop about\r\nmy own Geology. But I see I must mention that Scrope did suggest (and I\r\nhave alluded to him, page 118 (483/5. \"Geological Observations,\" Edition\r\nII., 1876. Chapter VI. opens with a discussion \"On the Separation of the\r\nConstituent Minerals of Lava, according to their Specific Gravities.\"\r\nMr. Darwin calls attention to the fact that Mr. P. Scrope had speculated\r\non the subject of the separation of the trachytic and basaltic series\r\nof lavas (page 113).), but without distinct reference and I fear not\r\nsufficiently, though I utterly forgot what he wrote) the separation of\r\nbasalt and trachyte; but he does not appear to have thought about the\r\ncrystals, which I believe to be the keystone of the phenomenon. I cannot\r\nbut think this separation of the molten elements has played a great part\r\nin the metamorphic rocks: how else could the basaltic dykes have come in\r\nthe great granitic districts such as those of Brazil? What a wonderful\r\nbook for labour is d'Archiac!...(483/6. Possibly this refers to\r\nd'Archiac's \"Histoire des Progres de la Geologie,\" 1848.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 484. TO LADY LYELL. Down, Wednesday night [1849?].\r\n\r\nI am going to beg a very very great favour of you: it is to translate\r\none page (and the title) of either Danish or Swedish or some such\r\nlanguage. I know not to whom else to apply, and I am quite dreadfully\r\ninterested about the barnacles therein described. Does Lyell know Loven,\r\nor his address and title? for I must write to him. If Lyell knows him I\r\nwould use his name as introduction; Loven I know by name as a first-rate\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nAccidentally I forgot to give you the \"Footsteps,\" which I now return,\r\nhaving ordered a copy for myself.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope the \"Craters of Denudation\" prosper; I pin my faith to\r\nthis view. (484/1. \"On Craters of Denudation, with Observations on the\r\nStructure and Growth of Volcanic Cones.\" \"Proc. Geol. Soc.\" Volume VI.,\r\n1850, pages 207-34. In a letter to Bunbury (January 17th, 1850)\r\nLyell wrote:...\"Darwin adopts my views as to Mauritius, St. Jago, and\r\nso-called elevation craters, which he has examined, and was puzzled\r\nwith.\"--\"Life of Sir Charles Lyell,\" Volume II., page 158.)\r\n\r\nPlease tell Sir C. Lyell that outside the crater-like mountains at St.\r\nJago, even throughout a distance of two or three miles, there has been\r\nmuch denudation of the older volcanic rocks contemporaneous with those\r\nof the ring of mountains. (484/2. The island of St. Jago, one of the\r\nCape de Verde group, is fully described in the \"Volcanic Islands,\"\r\nChapter 1.)\r\n\r\nI hope that you will not find the page troublesome, and that you will\r\nforgive me asking you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 485. TO C. LYELL. [November 6th, 1849].\r\n\r\nI have been deeply interested in your letter, and so far, at least,\r\nworthy of the time it must have cost you to write it. I have not much to\r\nsay. I look at the whole question as settled. Santorin is splendid!\r\nit is conclusive! it is perfect! (485/1. \"The Gulf of Santorin, in the\r\nGrecian Archipelago, has been for two thousand years a scene of active\r\nvolcanic operations. The largest of the three outer islands of the\r\ngroups (to which the general name of Santorin is given) is called Thera\r\n(or sometimes Santorin), and forms more than two-thirds of the circuit\r\nof the Gulf\" (\"Principles of Geology,\" Volume II., Edition X., London,\r\n1868, page 65). Lyell attributed \"the moderate slope of the beds in\r\nThera...to their having originally descended the inclined flanks of a\r\nlarge volcanic cone...\"; he refuted the theory of \"Elevation Craters\" by\r\nLeopold von Buch, which explained the slope of the rocks in a volcanic\r\nmountain by assuming that the inclined beds had been originally\r\nhorizontal and subsequently tilted by an explosion.) You have read\r\nDufrenoy in a hurry, I think, and added to the difficulty--it is\r\nthe whole hill or \"colline\" which is composed of tuff with\r\ncross-stratification; the central boss or \"monticule\" is simply\r\ntrachyte. Now, I have described one tuff crater at Galapagos (page 108)\r\n(485/2. The pages refer to Darwin's \"Geological Observations on the\r\nVolcanic Islands, etc.\" 1844.) which has broken through a great solid\r\nsheet of basalt: why should not an irregular mass of trachyte have\r\nbeen left in the middle after the explosion and emission of mud which\r\nproduced the overlying tuff? Or, again, I see no difficulty in a mass of\r\ntrachyte being exposed by subsequent dislocations and bared or cleaned\r\nby rain. At Ascension (page 40), subsequent to the last great aeriform\r\nexplosion, which has covered the country with fragments, there have been\r\ndislocations and a large circular subsidence...Do not quote Banks' case\r\n(485/3. This refers to Banks' Cove: see \"Volcanic Islands,\" page 107.)\r\n(for there has been some denudation there), but the \"elliptic one\"\r\n(page 105), which is 1,500 yards (three-quarters of a nautical mile)\r\nin internal diameter...and is the very one the inclination of whose\r\nmud stream on tuff strata I measured (before I had ever heard the name\r\nDufrenoy) and found varying from 25 to 30 deg. Albemarle Island, instead\r\nof being a crater of elevation, as Von Buch foolishly guessed, is formed\r\nof four great subaerial basaltic volcanoes (page 103), of one of which\r\nyou might like to know the external diameter of the summit or crater\r\nwas above three nautical miles. There are no \"craters of denudation\"\r\nat Galapagos. (485/4. See Lyell \"On Craters of Denudation, with\r\nObservations on the Structure and Growth of Volcanic Cones,\" \"Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc.\" Volume VI., 1850, page 207.)\r\n\r\nI hope you will allude to Mauritius. I think this is the instance on the\r\nlargest scale of any known, though imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nIf I were you I would give up consistency (or, at most, only allude in\r\nnote to your old edition) and bring out the Craters of Denudation as\r\na new view, which it essentially is. You cannot, I think, give it\r\nprominence as a novelty and yet keep to consistency and passages in old\r\neditions. I should grudge this new view being smothered in your address,\r\nand should like to see a separate paper. The one great channel to\r\nSantorin and Palma, etc., etc., is just like the one main channel\r\nbeing kept open in atolls and encircling barrier reefs, and on the same\r\nprinciple of water being driven in through several shallow breaches.\r\n\r\nI of course utterly reprobate my wild notion of circular elevation;\r\nit is a satisfaction to me to think that I perceived there was a screw\r\nloose in the old view, and, so far, I think I was of some service to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nDepend on it, you have for ever smashed, crushed, and abolished craters\r\nof elevation. There must be craters of engulfment, and of explosion\r\n(mere modifications of craters of eruption), but craters of denudation\r\nare the ones which have given rise to all the discussions.\r\n\r\nPray give my best thanks to Lady Lyell for her translation, which was as\r\nclear as daylight to me, including \"leglessness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 486. TO C. LYELL.\r\n\r\nDown [November 20th, 1849].\r\n\r\nI remembered the passage in E. de B. [Elie de Beaumont] and have now\r\nre-read it. I have always and do still entirely disbelieve it; in such a\r\nwonderful case he ought to have hammered every inch of rock up to actual\r\njunction; he describes no details of junction, and if I were in your\r\nplace I would absolutely dispute the fact of junction (or articulation\r\nas he oddly calls it) on such evidence. I go farther than you; I do not\r\nbelieve in the world there is or has been a junction between a dike and\r\nstream of lava of exact shape of either (1) or (2) Figure 2].\r\n\r\n(Figures 2, 3 and 4.)\r\n\r\nIf dike gave immediate origin to volcanic vent we should have craters of\r\n[an] elliptic shape [Figure 3]. I believe that when the molten rock in a\r\ndike comes near to the surface, some one two or three points will\r\nalways certainly chance to afford an easier passage upward to the actual\r\nsurface than along the whole line, and therefore that the dike will be\r\nconnected (if the whole were bared and dissected) with the vent by a\r\ncolumn or cone (see my elegant drawing) of lava [Figure 4]. I do not\r\ndoubt that the dikes are thus indirectly connected with eruptive vents.\r\nE. de B. seems to have observed many of his T; now without he supposes\r\nthe whole line of fissure or dike to have poured out lava (which\r\nimplies, as above remarked, craters of an elliptic or almost linear\r\nshape) on both sides, how extraordinarily improbable it is, that there\r\nshould have been in a single line of section so many intersections of\r\npoints eruption; he must, I think, make his orifices of eruption almost\r\nlinear or, if not so, astonishingly numerous. One must refer to what one\r\nhas seen oneself: do pray, when you go home, look at the section of a\r\nminute cone of eruption at the Galapagos, page 109 (486/1. \"Geological\r\nObservations on Volcanic Islands.\" London, 1890, page 238.), which is\r\nthe most perfect natural dissection of a crater which I have ever heard\r\nof, and the drawing of which you may, I assure you, trust; here the\r\narching over of the streams as they were poured out over the lip of\r\nthe crater was evident, and are now thus seen united to the central\r\nirregular column. Again, at St. Jago I saw some horizontal sections of\r\nthe bases of small craters, and the sources or feeders were circular. I\r\nreally cannot entertain a doubt that E. de B. is grossly wrong, and that\r\nyou are right in your view; but without most distinct evidence I will\r\nnever admit that a dike joins on rectangularly to a stream of lava. Your\r\nargument about the perpendicularity of the dike strikes me as good.\r\n\r\nThe map of Etna, which I have been just looking at, looks like a sudden\r\nfalling in, does it not? I am not much surprised at the linear vent\r\nin Santorin (this linear tendency ought to be difficult to a\r\ncircular-crater-of-elevation-believer), I think Abich (486/2.\r\n\"Geologische Beobachtungen uber die vulkanischen Erscheinungen und\r\nBildungen in Unter- und Mittel-Italien.\" Braunschweig, 1841.) describes\r\nhaving seen the same actual thing forming within the crater of Vesuvius.\r\nIn such cases what outline do you give to the upper surface of the lava\r\nin the dike connecting them? Surely it would be very irregular and would\r\nsend up irregular cones or columns as in my above splendid drawing.\r\n\r\nAt the Royal on Friday, after more doubt and misgiving than I almost\r\never felt, I voted to recommend Forbes for Royal Medal, and that view\r\nwas carried, Sedgwick taking the lead.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that all your party are pretty well. I know from\r\nexperience what you must have gone through. From old age with suffering\r\ndeath must be to all a happy release. (486/3. This seems to refer to\r\nthe death of Sir Charles Lyell's father, which occurred on November 8th,\r\n1849.)\r\n\r\nI saw Dan Sharpe the other day, and he told me he had been working at\r\nthe mica schist (i.e. not gneiss) in Scotland, and that he was quite\r\nconvinced my view was right. You are wrong and a heretic on this point,\r\nI know well.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 487. TO C.H.L. WOODD. Down, March 4th [1850].\r\n\r\n(487/1. The paper was sent in MS., and seems not to have been published.\r\nMr. Woodd was connected by marriage with Mr. Darwin's cousin, the late\r\nRev. W. Darwin Fox. It was perhaps in consequence of this that Mr.\r\nDarwin proposed Mr. Woodd for the Geological Society.)\r\n\r\nI have read over your paper with attention; but first let me thank you\r\nfor your very kind expressions towards myself. I really feel hardly\r\ncompetent to discuss the questions raised by your paper; I feel the\r\nwant of mathematical mechanics. All such problems strike me as awfully\r\ncomplicated; we do not even know what effect great pressure has on\r\nretarding liquefaction by heat, nor, I apprehend, on expansion. The\r\nchief objection which strikes me is a doubt whether a mass of strata,\r\nwhen heated, and therefore in some slight degree at least softened,\r\nwould bow outwards like a bar of metal. Consider of how many subordinate\r\nlayers each great mass would be composed, and the mineralogical changes\r\nin any length of any one stratum: I should have thought that the strata\r\nwould in every case have crumpled up, and we know how commonly in\r\nmetamorphic strata, which have undergone heat, the subordinate layers\r\nare wavy and sinuous, which has always been attributed to their\r\nexpansion whilst heated.\r\n\r\nBefore rocks are dried and quarried, manifold facts show how extremely\r\nflexible they are even when not at all heated. Without the bowing out\r\nand subsequent filling in of the roof of the cavity, if I understand\r\nyou, there would be no subsidence. Of course the crumpling up of the\r\nstrata would thicken them, and I see with you that this might compress\r\nthe underlying fluidified rock, which in its turn might escape by\r\na volcano or raise a weaker part of the earth's crust; but I am too\r\nignorant to have any opinion whether force would be easily propagated\r\nthrough a viscid mass like molten rock; or whether such viscid mass\r\nwould not act in some degree like sand and refuse to transmit pressure,\r\nas in the old experiment of trying to burst a piece of paper tied\r\nover the end of a tube with a stick, an inch or two of sand being\r\nonly interposed. I have always myself felt the greatest difficulty in\r\nbelieving in waves of heat coming first to this and then to that quarter\r\nof the world: I suspect that heat plays quite a subordinate part in the\r\nupward and downward movements of the earth's crust; though of course\r\nit must swell the strata where first affected. I can understand Sir\r\nJ. Herschel's manner of bringing heat to unheated strata--namely, by\r\ncovering them up by a mile or so of new strata, and then the heat would\r\ntravel into the lower ones. But who can tell what effect this mile or\r\ntwo of new sedimentary strata would have from mere gravity on the level\r\nof the supporting surface? Of course such considerations do not render\r\nless true that the expansion of the strata by heat would have some\r\neffect on the level of the surface; but they show us how awfully\r\ncomplicated the phenomenon is. All young geologists have a great turn\r\nfor speculation; I have burned my fingers pretty sharply in that way,\r\nand am now perhaps become over-cautious; and feel inclined to cavil at\r\nspeculation when the direct and immediate effect of a cause in question\r\ncannot be shown. How neatly you draw your diagrams; I wish you would\r\nturn your attention to real sections of the earth's crust, and then\r\nspeculate to your heart's content on them; I can have no doubt that\r\nspeculative men, with a curb on, make far the best observers. I\r\nsincerely wish I could have made any remarks of more interest to you,\r\nand more directly bearing on your paper; but the subject strikes me as\r\ntoo difficult and complicated. With every good wish that you may go\r\non with your geological studies, speculations, and especially\r\nobservations...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 488. TO C. LYELL. Down, March 24th [1853].\r\n\r\nI have often puzzled over Dana's case, in itself and in relation to the\r\ntrains of S. American volcanoes of different heights in action at the\r\nsame time (page 605, Volume V. \"Geological Transactions.\" (488/1. \"On\r\nthe Connection of certain Volcanic Phenomena in South America, and on\r\nthe Formation of Mountain Chains and Volcanoes, as the Effect of the\r\nsame Power by which Continents are Elevated\" (\"Trans. Geol. Soc.\"\r\nVolume V., page 601, 1840). On page 605 Darwin records instances of the\r\nsimultaneous activity after an earthquake of several volcanoes in\r\nthe Cordillera.)) I can throw no light on the subject. I presume you\r\nremember that Hopkins (488/2. See \"Report on the Geological Theories\r\nof Elevation and Earthquakes,\" by W. Hopkins, \"Brit. Assoc. Rep.\" 1847,\r\npage 34.) in some one (I forget which) of his papers discusses such\r\ncases, and urgently wishes the height of the fluid lava was known in\r\nadjoining volcanoes when in contemporaneous action; he argues vehemently\r\nagainst (as far as I remember) volcanoes in action of different heights\r\nbeing connected with one common source of liquefied rock. If lava was as\r\nfluid as water, the case would indeed be hopeless; and I fancy we should\r\nbe led to look at the deep-seated rock as solid though intensely hot,\r\nand becoming fluid as soon as a crack lessened the tension of the\r\nsuper-incumbent strata. But don't you think that viscid lava might be\r\nvery slow in communicating its pressure equally in all directions? I\r\nremember thinking strongly that Dana's case within the one crater of\r\nKilauea proved too much; it really seems monstrous to suppose that the\r\nlava within the same crater is not connected at no very great depth.\r\n\r\nWhen one reflects on (and still better sees) the enormous masses of lava\r\napparently shot miles high up, like cannon-balls, the force seems out of\r\nall proportion to the mere gravity of the liquefied lava; I should think\r\nthat a channel a little straightly or more open would determine the line\r\nof explosion, like the mouth of a cannon compared to the touch-hole.\r\nIf a high-pressure boiler was cracked across, no one would think for a\r\nmoment that the quantity of water and steam expelled at different points\r\ndepended on the less or greater height of the water within the boiler\r\nabove these points, but on the size of the crack at these points; and\r\nsteam and water might be driven out both at top and bottom. May not a\r\nvolcano be likened to a protruding and cracked portion on a vast natural\r\nhigh-pressure boiler, formed by the surrounding area of country? In\r\nfact, I think my simile would be truer if the difference consisted only\r\nin the cracked case of the boiler being much thicker in some parts than\r\nin others, and therefore having to expel a greater thickness or depth of\r\nwater in the thicker cracks or parts--a difference of course absolutely\r\nas nothing.\r\n\r\nI have seen an old boiler in action, with steam and drops of water\r\nspurting out of some of the rivet-holes. No one would think whether the\r\nrivet-holes passed through a greater or less thickness of iron, or were\r\nconnected with the water higher or lower within the boiler, so small\r\nwould the gravity be compared with the force of the steam. If the boiler\r\nhad been not heated, then of course there would be a great difference\r\nwhether the rivet-holes entered the water high or low, so that there\r\nwas greater or less pressure of gravity. How to close my volcanic\r\nrivet-holes I don't know.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether you will understand what I am driving at, and it\r\nwill not signify much whether you do or not. I remember in old days (I\r\nmay mention the subject as we are on it) often wishing I could get\r\nyou to look at continental elevations as THE phenomenon, and volcanic\r\noutbursts and tilting up of mountain chains as connected, but quite\r\nsecondary, phenomena. I became deeply impressed with the truth of this\r\nview in S. America, and I do not think you hold it, or if so make it\r\nclear: the same explanation, whatever it may be, which will account for\r\nthe whole coast of Chili rising, will and must apply to the volcanic\r\naction of the Cordillera, though modified no doubt by the liquefied\r\nrock coming to the surface and reaching water, and so [being] rendered\r\nexplosive. To me it appears that this ought to be borne in mind in your\r\npresent subject of discussion. I have written at too great length; and\r\nhave amused myself if I have done you no good--so farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 489. TO C. LYELL. Down, July 5th [1856].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your long letter, which has interested me\r\nmuch; but before coming to the volcanic cosmogony I must say that I\r\ncannot gather your verdict as judge and jury (and not as advocate)\r\non the continental extensions of late authors (489/1. See \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 74; Letter to Lyell, June 25th, 1856: also\r\nletters in the sections of the present work devoted to Evolution and\r\nGeographical Distribution.), which I must grapple with, and which as yet\r\nstrikes me as quite unphilosophical, inasmuch as such extensions must be\r\napplied to every oceanic island, if to any one, as to Madeira; and this\r\nI cannot admit, seeing that the skeletons, at least, of our continents\r\nare ancient, and seeing the geological nature of the oceanic islands\r\nthemselves. Do aid me with your judgment: if I could honestly admit\r\nthese great [extensions], they would do me good service.\r\n\r\nWith respect to active volcanic areas being rising areas, which looks\r\nso pretty on the coral maps, I have formerly felt \"uncomfortable\" on\r\nexactly the same grounds with you, viz. maritime position of volcanoes;\r\nand still more from the immense thicknesses of Silurian, etc., volcanic\r\nstrata, which thicknesses at first impress the mind with the idea of\r\nsubsidence. If this could be proved, the theory would be smashed; but\r\nin deep oceans, though the bottom were rising, great thicknesses of\r\nsubmarine lava might accumulate. But I found, after writing Coral Book,\r\ncases in my notes of submarine vesicular lava-streams in the upper\r\nmasses of the Cordillera, formed, as I believe, during subsidence,\r\nwhich staggered me greatly. With respect to the maritime position of\r\nvolcanoes, I have long been coming to the conclusion that there must\r\nbe some law causing areas of elevation (consequently of land) and of\r\nsubsidence to be parallel (as if balancing each other) and closely\r\napproximate; I think this from the form of continents with a deep ocean\r\non one side, from coral map, and especially from conversations with you\r\non immense subsidences of the Carboniferous and [other] periods, and yet\r\nwith continued great supply of sediment. If this be so, such areas,\r\nwith opposite movements, would probably be separated by sets of parallel\r\ncracks, and would be the seat of volcanoes and tilts, and consequently\r\nvolcanoes and mountains would be apt to be maritime; but why volcanoes\r\nshould cling to the rising edge of the cracks I cannot conjecture. That\r\nareas with extinct volcanic archipelagoes may subside to any extent I do\r\nnot doubt.\r\n\r\nYour view of the bottom of Atlantic long sinking with continued volcanic\r\noutbursts and local elevations at Madeira, Canaries, etc., grates (but\r\nof course I do not know how complex the phenomena are which are thus\r\nexplained) against my judgment; my general ideas strongly lead me to\r\nbelieve in elevatory movements being widely extended. One ought, I\r\nthink, never to forget that when a volcano is in action we have distinct\r\nproof of an action from within outwards. Nor should we forget, as I\r\nbelieve follows from Hopkins (489/2. \"Researches in Physical Geology,\"\r\nW. Hopkins, \"Trans. Phil. Soc. Cambridge,\" Volume VI., 1838. See also\r\n\"Report on the Geological Theories of Elevation and Earthquakes,\" W.\r\nHopkins, \"Brit. Assoc. Rep.\" page 33, 1847 (Oxford meeting).), and as I\r\nhave insisted in my Earthquake paper, that volcanoes and mountain chains\r\nare mere accidents resulting from the elevation of an area, and as\r\nmountain chains are generally long, so should I view areas of elevation\r\nas generally large. (489/3. \"On the Connexion of certain Volcanic\r\nPhenomena in S. America, and on the Formation of Mountain Chains and\r\nVolcanoes, as the Effect of the same Power by which Continents are\r\nElevated,\" \"Trans. Geol. Soc.\" Volume V., page 601, 1840. \"Bearing in\r\nmind Mr. Hopkins' demonstration, if there be considerable elevation\r\nthere must be fissures, and, if fissures, almost certainly unequal\r\nupheaval, or subsequent sinking down, the argument may be finally\r\nthus put: mountain chains are the effects of continental elevations;\r\ncontinental elevations and the eruptive force of volcanoes are due to\r\none great motive, now in progressive action...\" (loc. cit., page 629).)\r\n\r\nYour old original view that great oceans must be sinking areas, from\r\nthere being causes making land and yet there being little land, has\r\nalways struck me till lately as very good. But in some degree this\r\nstarts from the assumption that within periods of which we know anything\r\nthere was either a continent in such areas, or at least a sea-bottom of\r\nnot extreme depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 490. TO C. LYELL. King's Head Hotel, Sandown, Isle of Wight, July\r\n18th [1858].\r\n\r\nI write merely to thank you for the abstract of the Etna paper. (490/1.\r\n\"On the Structure of Lavas which have Consolidated on Steep Slopes,\r\nwith Remarks on the Mode of Origin of Mount Etna and on the Theory of\r\n'Craters of Elevation,'\" by C. Lyell, \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" Volume\r\nCXLVIII., page 703, 1859.) It seems to me a very grand contribution to\r\nour volcanic knowledge. Certainly I never expected to see E. de B.'s\r\n[Elie de Beaumont] theory of slopes so completely upset. He must have\r\npicked out favourable cases for measurement. And such an array of facts\r\nhe gives! You have scotched, and will see die, I now think, the Crater\r\nof Elevation theory. But what vitality there is in a plausible theory!\r\n(490/2. The rest of this letter is published in \"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\npage 129.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 491. TO C. LYELL. Down, November 25th [1860].\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to think over your discussion, but not with much\r\nsuccess. You will have to lay down, I think, very clearly, what\r\nfoundation you argue from--four parts (which seems to me exceedingly\r\nmoderate on your part) of Europe being now at rest, with one part\r\nundergoing movement. How it is, that from this you can argue that the\r\none part which is now moving will have rested since the commencement of\r\nthe Glacial period in the proportion of four to one, I do not pretend\r\nto see with any clearness; but does not your argument rest on the\r\nassumption that within a given period, say two or three million years,\r\nthe whole of Europe necessarily has to undergo movement? This may\r\nbe probable or not so, but it seems to me that you must explain the\r\nfoundation of your argument from space to time, which at first, to me\r\nwas very far from obvious. I can, of course, see that if you can make\r\nout your argument satisfactorily to yourself and others it would be most\r\nvaluable. I can imagine some one saying that it is not fair to argue\r\nthat the great plains of Europe and the mountainous districts of\r\nScotland and Wales have been at all subjected to the same laws of\r\nmovement. Looking to the whole world, it has been my opinion, from the\r\nvery size of the continents and oceans, and especially from the enormous\r\nranges of so many mountain-chains (resulting from cracks which follow\r\nfrom vast areas of elevation, as Hopkins argues (491/1. See \"Report\r\non the Geological Theories of Elevation and Earthquakes.\" by William\r\nHopkins. \"Brit. Assoc. Rep.\" 1847, pages 33-92; also the Anniversary\r\nAddress to the Geological Society by W. Hopkins in 1852 (\"Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc.\" Volume VIII.); in this Address, pages lxviii et seq.)\r\nreference is made to the theory of elevation which rests on the\r\nsupposition \"of the simultaneous action of an upheaving force at every\r\npoint of the area over which the phenomena of elevation preserve a\r\ncertain character of continuity...The elevated mass...becomes stretched,\r\nand is ultimately torn and fissured in those directions in which\r\nthe tendency thus to tear is greatest...It is thus that the complex\r\nphenomena of elevation become referable to a general and simple\r\nmechanical cause...\")) and from other reasons, it has been my opinion\r\nthat, as a general rule, very large portions of the world have been\r\nsimultaneously affected by elevation or subsidence. I can see that this\r\ndoes not apply so strongly to broken Europe, any more than to the Malay\r\nArchipelago. Yet, had I been asked, I should have said that probably\r\nnearly the whole of Europe was subjected during the Glacial period\r\nto periods of elevation and of subsidence. It does not seem to me so\r\ncertain that the kinds of partial movement which we now see going on\r\nshow us the kind of movement which Europe has been subjected to since\r\nthe commencement of the Glacial period. These notions are at least\r\npossible, and would they not vitiate your argument? Do you not rest on\r\nthe belief that, as Scandinavia and some few other parts are now rising,\r\nand a few others sinking, and the remainder at rest, so it has been\r\nsince the commencement of the Glacial period? With my notions I\r\nshould require this to be made pretty probable before I could put much\r\nconfidence in your calculations. You have probably thought this all\r\nover, but I give you the reflections which come across me, supposing\r\nfor the moment that you took the proportions of space at rest and in\r\nmovement as plainly applicable to time. I have no doubt that you have\r\nsufficient evidence that, at the commencement of the Glacial period, the\r\nland in Scotland, Wales, etc., stood as high or higher than at present,\r\nbut I forget the proofs.\r\n\r\nHaving burnt my own fingers so consumedly with the Wealden, I am fearful\r\nfor you, but I well know how infinitely more cautious, prudent, and\r\nfar-seeing you are than I am; but for heaven's sake take care of your\r\nfingers; to burn them severely, as I have done, is very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nYour 2 1/2 feet for a century of elevation seems a very handsome\r\nallowance. can D. Forbes really show the great elevation of Chili? I am\r\nastounded at it, and I took some pains on the point.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to say that you may not be right to judge of the past\r\nmovements of Europe by those now and recently going on, yet it somehow\r\ngrates against my judgment,--perhaps only against my prejudices.\r\n\r\nAs a change from elevation to subsidence implies some great subterranean\r\nor cosmical change, one may surely calculate on long intervals of\r\nrest between. Though, if the cause of the change be ever proved to be\r\nastronomical, even this might be doubtful.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I do not know whether I have made clear what I think probable, or\r\nat least possible: viz., that the greater part of Europe has at times\r\nbeen elevated in some degree equably; at other times it has all subsided\r\nequably; and at other times might all have been stationary; and at other\r\ntimes it has been subjected to various unequal movements, up and down,\r\nas at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 492. TO C. LYELL. Down, December 4th [1860].\r\n\r\nIt certainly seems to me safer to rely solely on the slowness of\r\nascertained up-and-down movement. But you could argue length of probable\r\ntime before the movement became reversed, as in your letter. And might\r\nyou not add that over the whole world it would probably be admitted that\r\na larger area is NOW at rest than in movement? and this I think would be\r\na tolerably good reason for supposing long intervals of rest. You might\r\neven adduce Europe, only guarding yourself by saying that possibly (I\r\nwill not say probably, though my prejudices would lead me to say so)\r\nEurope may at times have gone up and down all together. I forget whether\r\nin a former letter you made a strong point of upward movement being\r\nalways interrupted by long periods of rest. After writing to you, out\r\nof curiosity I glanced at the early chapters in my \"Geology of South\r\nAmerica,\" and the areas of elevation on the E. and W. coasts are so\r\nvast, and proofs of many successive periods of rest so striking,\r\nthat the evidence becomes to my mind striking. With regard to the\r\nastronomical causes of change: in ancient days in the \"Beagle\" when I\r\nreflected on the repeated great oscillations of level on the very same\r\narea, and when I looked at the symmetry of mountain chains over such\r\nvast spaces, I used to conclude that the day would come when the slow\r\nchange of form in the semi-fluid matter beneath the crust would be found\r\nto be the cause of volcanic action, and of all changes of level. And the\r\nlate discussion in the \"Athenaeum\" (492/1. \"On the Change of Climate\r\nin Different Regions of the Earth.\" Letters from Sir Henry James, Col.\r\nR.E., \"Athenaeum,\" August 25th, 1860, page 256; September 15th, page\r\n355; September 29th, page 415; October 13th, page 483. Also letter from\r\nJ. Beete Jukes, Local Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland, loc.\r\ncit., September 8th, page 322; October 6th, page 451.), by Sir H. James\r\n(though his letter seemed to me mighty poor, and what Jukes wrote good),\r\nreminded me of this notion. In case astronomical agencies should ever\r\nbe proved or rendered probable, I imagine, as in nutation or precession,\r\nthat an upward movement or protrusion of fluidified matter below might\r\nbe immediately followed by movement of an opposite nature. This is all\r\nthat I meant.\r\n\r\nI have not read Jamieson, or yet got the number. (492/2. Possibly\r\nWilliam Jameson, \"Journey from Quito to Cayambe,\" \"Geog. Soc. Journ.\"\r\nVolume XXXI., page 184, 1861.) I was very much struck with Forbes'\r\nexplanation of n[itrate] of soda beds and the saliferous crust, which\r\nI saw and examined at Iquique. (492/3. \"On the Geology of Bolivia and\r\nSouthern Peru,\" by D. Forbes, \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XVII.,\r\npage 7, 1861. Mr. Forbes attributes the formation of the saline deposits\r\nto lagoons of salt water, the communication of which with the sea has\r\nbeen cut off by the rising of the land (loc. cit., page 13).) I often\r\nspeculated on the greater rise inland of the Cordilleras, and could\r\nnever satisfy myself...\r\n\r\nI have not read Stur, and am awfully behindhand in many things...(492/4.\r\nThe end of this letter is published as a footnote in \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 352.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 5. Map of part of South America and the Galapagos Archipelago.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 493. TO C. LYELL. Down, July 18th [1867].\r\n\r\n(493/1. The first part of this letter is published in \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., page 71.)\r\n\r\n(493/2. Tahiti (Society Islands) is coloured blue in the map showing\r\nthe distribution of the different kinds of reefs in \"The Structure and\r\nDistribution of Coral Reefs,\" Edition III., 1889, page 185. The blue\r\ncolour indicates the existence of barrier reefs and atolls which, on\r\nDarwin's theory, point to subsidence.)\r\n\r\nTahiti is, I believe, rightly coloured, for the reefs are so far from\r\nthe land, and the ocean so deep, that there must have been subsidence,\r\nthough not very recently. I looked carefully, and there is no evidence\r\nof recent elevation. I quite agree with you versus Herschel on Volcanic\r\nIslands. (493/3. Sir John Herschel suggested that the accumulation on\r\nthe sea-floor of sediment, derived from the waste of the island,\r\npresses down the bed of the ocean, the continent being on the other hand\r\nrelieved of pressure; \"this brings about a state of strain in the crust\r\nwhich will crack in its weakest spot, the heavy side going down, and the\r\nlight side rising.\" In discussing this view Lyell writes (\"Principles,\"\r\nVolume II. Edition X., page 229), \"This hypothesis appears to me of\r\nvery partial application, for active volcanoes, even such as are on the\r\nborders of continents, are rarely situated where great deltas have been\r\nforming, whether in Pliocene or post-Tertiary times. The number, also,\r\nof active volcanoes in oceanic islands is very great, not only in\r\nthe Pacific, but equally in the Atlantic, where no load of coral\r\nmatter...can cause a partial weighting and pressing down of a supposed\r\nflexible crust.\") Would not the Atlantic and Antarctic volcanoes be the\r\nbest examples for you, as there then can be no coral mud to depress\r\nthe bottom? In my \"Volcanic Islands,\" page 126, I just suggest that\r\nvolcanoes may occur so frequently in the oceanic areas as the surface\r\nwould be most likely to crack when first being elevated. I find one\r\nremark, page 128 (493/4. \"Volcanic Islands,\" page 128: \"The islands,\r\nmoreover, of some of the small volcanic groups, which thus border\r\ncontinents, are placed in lines related to those along which the\r\nadjoining shores of the continents trend\" [see Figure 5].), which seems\r\nto me worth consideration--viz. the parallelism of the lines of eruption\r\nin volcanic archipelagoes with the coast lines of the nearest continent,\r\nfor this seems to indicate a mechanical rather than a chemical\r\nconnection in both cases, i.e. the lines of disturbance and cracking. In\r\nmy \"South American Geology,\" page 185 (493/5. \"Geological Observations\r\non South America,\" London, 1846, page 185.), I allude to the remarkable\r\nabsence at present of active volcanoes on the east side of the\r\nCordillera in relation to the absence of the sea on this side. Yet I\r\nmust own I have long felt a little sceptical on the proximity of water\r\nbeing the exciting cause. The one volcano in the interior of Asia is\r\nsaid, I think, to be near great lakes; but if lakes are so important,\r\nwhy are there not many other volcanoes within other continents? I have\r\nalways felt rather inclined to look at the position of volcanoes on the\r\nborders of continents, as resulting from coast lines being the lines of\r\nseparation between areas of elevation and subsidence. But it is useless\r\nin me troubling you with my old speculations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 494. TO A.R. WALLACE. March 22nd [1869].\r\n\r\n(494/1. The following extract from a letter to Mr. Wallace refers to his\r\n\"Malay Archipelago,\" 1869.)\r\n\r\nI have only one criticism of a general nature, and I am not sure that\r\nother geologists would agree with me. You repeatedly speak as if the\r\npouring out of lava, etc., from volcanoes actually caused the subsidence\r\nof an adjoining area. I quite agree that areas undergoing opposite\r\nmovements are somehow connected; but volcanic outbursts must, I think,\r\nbe looked at as mere accidents in the swelling up of a great dome or\r\nsurface of plutonic rocks, and there seems no more reason to conclude\r\nthat such swelling or elevation in mass is the cause of the subsidence,\r\nthan that the subsidence is the cause of the elevation, which latter\r\nview is indeed held by some geologists. I have regretted to find so\r\nlittle about the habits of the many animals which you have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 495. TO C. LYELL. Down, May 20th, 1869.\r\n\r\nI have been much pleased to hear that you have been looking at my\r\nS. American book (495/1. \"Geological Observations on South America,\"\r\nLondon, 1846.), which I thought was as completely dead and gone as any\r\npre-Cambrian fossil. You are right in supposing that my memory about\r\nAmerican geology has grown very hazy. I remember, however, a paper on\r\nthe Cordillera by D. Forbes (495/2. \"Geology of Bolivia and South Peru,\"\r\nby Forbes, \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XVII., pages 7-62, 1861.\r\nForbes admits that there is \"the fullest evidence of elevation of the\r\nChile coast since the arrival of the Spaniards. North of Arica, if we\r\naccept the evidence of M. d'Orbigny and others, the proof of elevation\r\nis much more decided; and consequently it may be possible that here,\r\nas is the case about Lima, according to Darwin, the elevation may have\r\ntaken place irregularly in places...\" (loc. cit., page 11).), with\r\nsplendid sections, which I saw in MS., but whether \"referred\" to me or\r\nlent to me I cannot remember. This would be well worth your looking to,\r\nas I think he both supports and criticises my views. In Ormerod's\r\nIndex to the Journal (495/3. \"Classified Index to the Transactions,\r\nProceedings and Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society.\"), which I\r\ndo not possess, you would, no doubt, find a reference; but I think the\r\nsections would be worth borrowing from Forbes. Domeyko (495/4. Reference\r\nis made by Forbes in his paper on Bolivia and Peru to the work of\r\nIgnacio Domeyko on the geology of Chili. Several papers by this author\r\nwere published in the \"Annales des Mines\" between 1840 and 1869, also in\r\nthe \"Comptes Rendus\" of 1861, 1864, etc.) has published in the \"Comptes\r\nRendus\" papers on Chili, but not, as far as I can remember, on the\r\nstructure of the mountains. Forbes, however, would know. What you say\r\nabout the plications being steepest in the central and generally highest\r\npart of the range is conclusive to my mind that there has been the chief\r\naxis of disturbance. The lateral thrusting has always appeared to me\r\nfearfully perplexing. I remember formerly thinking that all lateral\r\nflexures probably occurred deep beneath the surface, and have been\r\nbrought into view by an enormous superincumbent mass having been\r\ndenuded. If a large and deep box were filled with layers of damp paper\r\nor clay, and a blunt wedge was slowly driven up from beneath, would not\r\nthe layers above it and on both sides become greatly convoluted, whilst\r\nthose towards the top would be only slightly arched? When I spoke of\r\nthe Andes being comparatively recent, I suppose that I referred to the\r\nabsence of the older formations. In looking to my volume, which I have\r\nnot done for many years, I came upon a passage (page 232) which would be\r\nworth your looking at, if you have ever felt perplexed, as I often was,\r\nabout the sources of volcanic rocks in mountain chains. You have stirred\r\nup old memories, and at the risk of being a bore I should like to call\r\nyour attention to another point which formerly perplexed me much--viz.\r\nthe presence of basaltic dikes in most great granitic areas. I cannot\r\nbut think the explanation given at page 123 of my \"Volcanic Islands\" is\r\nthe true one. (495/5. On page 123 of the \"Geological Observations on the\r\nVolcanic Islands visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. 'Beagle,'\" 1844,\r\nDarwin quotes several instances of greenstone and basaltic dikes\r\nintersecting granitic and allied metamorphic rocks. He suggests that\r\nthese dikes \"have been formed by fissures penetrating into partially\r\ncooled rocks of the granitic and metamorphic series, and by their more\r\nfluid parts, consisting chiefly of hornblende oozing out, and being\r\nsucked into such fissures.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 496. TO VICTOR CARUS. Down, March 21st, 1876.\r\n\r\nThe very kind expressions in your letter have gratified me deeply.\r\n\r\nI quite forget what I said about my geological works, but the papers\r\nreferred to in your letter are the right ones. I enclose a list with\r\nthose which are certainly not worth translating marked with a red line;\r\nbut whether those which are not thus marked with a red line are worth\r\ntranslation you will have to decide. I think much more highly of my\r\nbook on \"Volcanic Islands\" since Mr. Judd, by far the best judge on the\r\nsubject in England, has, as I hear, learnt much from it.\r\n\r\nI think the short paper on the \"formation of mould\" is worth\r\ntranslating, though, if I have time and strength, I hope to write\r\nanother and longer paper on the subject.\r\n\r\nI can assure you that the idea of any one translating my books better\r\nthan you never even momentarily crossed my mind. I am glad that you can\r\ngive a fairly good account of your health, or at least that it is not\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 497. TO T. MELLARD READE. London, December 9th, 1880.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that I do not return home till the middle of next\r\nweek, and as I order no pamphlets to be forwarded to me by post, I\r\ncannot return the \"Geolog. Mag.\" until my return home, nor could my\r\nservants pick it out of the multitude which come by the post. (497/1.\r\nArticle on \"Oceanic Islands,\" by T. Mellard Reade, \"Geol. Mag.\" Volume\r\nVIII., page 75, 1881.)\r\n\r\nAs I remarked in a letter to a friend, with whom I was discussing\r\nWallace's last book (497/2. Wallace's \"Island Life,\" 1880.), the subject\r\nto which you refer seems to me a most perplexing one. The fact which\r\nI pointed out many years ago, that all oceanic islands are volcanic\r\n(except St. Paul's, and now this is viewed by some as the nucleus of an\r\nancient volcano), seems to me a strong argument that no continent ever\r\noccupied the great oceans. (497/3. \"During my investigations on coral\r\nreefs I had occasion to consult the works of many voyagers, and I\r\nwas invariably struck with the fact that, with rare exceptions, the\r\ninnumerable islands scattered through the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic\r\nOceans were composed either of volcanic or of modern coral rocks\"\r\n(\"Geological Observations on Volcanic Islands, etc.\" Edition II., 1876,\r\npage 140).) Then there comes the statement from the \"Challenger\" that\r\nall sediment is deposited within one or two hundred miles from the\r\nshores, though I should have thought this rather doubtful with respect\r\nto great rivers like the Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe chalk formerly seemed to me the best case of an ocean having\r\nextended where a continent now stands; but it seems that some good\r\njudges deny that the chalk is an oceanic deposit. On the whole, I lean\r\nto the side that the continents have since Cambrian times occupied\r\napproximately their present positions. But, as I have said, the question\r\nseems a difficult one, and the more it is discussed the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 498. TO A. AGASSIZ. Down, January 1st, 1881.\r\n\r\nI must write a line or two to thank you much for having written to me so\r\nlong a letter on coral reefs at a time when you must have been so busy.\r\nIs it not difficult to avoid believing that the wonderful elevation\r\nin the West Indies must have been accompanied by much subsidence,\r\nnotwithstanding the state of Florida? (498/1. The Florida reefs cannot\r\nbe explained by subsidence. Alexander Agassiz, who has described these\r\nreefs in detail (\"Three Cruises of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey\r\nSteamer 'Blake,'\" 2 volumes, London, 1888), shows that the southern\r\nextremity of the peninsula \"is of comparatively recent growth,\r\nconsisting of concentric barrier-reefs, which have been gradually\r\nconverted into land by the accumulation of intervening mud-flats\" (see\r\nalso Appendix II., page 287, to Darwin's \"Coral Reefs,\" by T.G. Bonney,\r\nEdition III., 1889.)) When reflecting in old days on the configuration\r\nof our continents, the position of mountain chains, and especially on\r\nthe long-continued supply of sediment over the same areas, I used to\r\nthink (as probably have many other persons) that areas of elevation and\r\nsubsidence must as a general rule be separated by a single great line\r\nof fissure, or rather of several closely adjoining lines of fissure. I\r\nmention this because, when looking within more recent times at charts\r\nwith the depths of the sea marked by different tints, there seems to be\r\nsome connection between the profound depths of the ocean and the trends\r\nof the nearest, though distant, continents; and I have often wished\r\nthat some one like yourself, to whom the subject was familiar, would\r\nspeculate on it.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I do hope that you will re-urge your views about the reappearance\r\nof old characters (498/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., pages 245,\r\n246.), for, as far as I can judge, the most important views are often\r\nneglected unless they are urged and re-urged.\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to you for sending me very many most valuable\r\nworks published at your institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.IX.II. ICE-ACTION, 1841-1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 499. TO C. LYELL. [1841.]\r\n\r\nYour extract has set me puzzling very much, and as I find I am better\r\nat present for not going out, you must let me unload my mind on paper.\r\nI thought everything so beautifully clear about glaciers, but now your\r\ncase and Agassiz's statement about the cavities in the rock formed by\r\ncascades in the glaciers, shows me I don't understand their structure at\r\nall. I wish out of pure curiosity I could make it out. (499/1. \"Etudes\r\nsur les Glaciers,\" by Louis Agassiz, 1840, contains a description of\r\ncascades (page 343), and \"des cavites interieures\" (page 348).)\r\n\r\nIf the glacier travelled on (and it certainly does travel on), and the\r\nwater kept cutting back over the edge of the ice, there would be a great\r\nslit in front of the cascade; if the water did not cut back, the whole\r\nhollow and cascade, as you say, must travel on; and do you suppose the\r\nnext season it falls down some crevice higher up? In any case, how in\r\nthe name of Heaven can it make a hollow in solid rock, which surely must\r\nbe a work of many years? I must point out another fact which Agassiz\r\ndoes not, as it appears to me, leave very clear. He says all the blocks\r\non the surface of the glaciers are angular, and those in the moraines\r\nrounded, yet he says the medial moraines whence the surface rocks come\r\nand are a part [of], are only two lateral moraines united. Can he\r\nrefer to terminal moraines alone when he says fragments in moraines are\r\nrounded? What a capital book Agassiz's is. In [reading] all the early\r\npart I gave up entirely the Jura blocks, and was heartily ashamed of my\r\nappendix (499/2. \"M. Agassiz has lately written on the subject of the\r\nglaciers and boulders of the Alps. He clearly proves, as it appears to\r\nme, that the presence of the boulders on the Jura cannot be explained\r\nby any debacle, or by the power of ancient glaciers driving before them\r\nmoraines...M. Agassiz also denies that they were transported by floating\r\nice.\" (\"Voyages of the 'Adventure' and 'Beagle,'\" Volume III., 1839:\r\n\"Journal and Remarks: Addenda,\" page 617.)) (and am so still of the\r\nmanner in which I presumptuously speak of Agassiz), but it seems by his\r\nown confession that ordinary glaciers could not have transported the\r\nblocks there, and if an hypothesis is to be introduced the sea is much\r\nsimpler; floating ice seems to me to account for everything as well\r\nas, and sometimes better than the solid glaciers. The hollows, however,\r\nformed by the ice-cascades appear to me the strongest hostile fact,\r\nthough certainly, as you said, one sees hollow round cavities on present\r\nrock-beaches.\r\n\r\nI am glad to observe that Agassiz does not pretend that direction\r\nof scratches is hostile to floating ice. By the way, how do you and\r\nBuckland account for the \"tails\" of diluvium in Scotland? (499/3. Mr.\r\nDarwin speaks of the tails of diluvium in Scotland extending from\r\nthe protected side of a hill, of which the opposite side, facing the\r\ndirection from which the ice came, is marked by grooves and striae\r\n(loc. cit., pages 622, 623).) I thought in my appendix this made out the\r\nstrongest argument for rocks having been scratched by floating ice.\r\n\r\nSome facts about boulders in Chiloe will, I think, in a very small\r\ndegree elucidate some parts of Jura case. What a grand new feature all\r\nthis ice work is in Geology! How old Hutton would have stared! (499/4.\r\nSir Charles Lyell speaks of the Huttonian theory as being characterised\r\nby \"the exclusion of all causes not supposed to belong to the present\r\norder of Nature\" (Lyell's \"Principles,\" Edition XII., volume I., page\r\n76, 1875). Sir Archibald Geikie has recently edited the third volume of\r\nHutton's \"Theory of the Earth,\" printed by the Geological Society, 1899.\r\nSee also \"The Founders of Geology,\" by Sir Archibald Geikie; London,\r\n1897.)\r\n\r\nI ought to be ashamed of myself for scribbling on so. Talking of shame,\r\nI have sent a copy of my \"Journal\" (499/5. \"Journal and Remarks,\"\r\n1832-36. See note 2, page 148.) with very humble note to Agassiz, as an\r\napology for the tone I used, though I say, I daresay he has never seen\r\nmy appendix, or would care at all about it.\r\n\r\nI did not suppose my note about Glen Roy could have been of any use to\r\nyou--I merely scribbled what came uppermost. I made one great oversight,\r\nas you would perceive. I forgot the Glacier theory: if a glacier most\r\ngradually disappeared from mouth of Spean Valley [this] would account\r\nfor buttresses of shingle below lowest shelf. The difficulty I put about\r\nthe ice-barrier of the middle Glen Roy shelf keeping so long at exactly\r\nsame level does certainly appear to me insuperable. (499/5. For a\r\ndescription of the shelves or parallel roads in Glen Roy see Darwin's\r\n\"Observations on the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, etc.\" \"Phil. Trans. R.\r\nSoc.\" 1839, page 39; also Letter 517 et seq.)\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful fact this breakdown of old Niagara is. How it disturbs\r\nthe calculations about lengths of time before the river would have\r\nreached the lakes.\r\n\r\nI hope Mrs. Lyell will read this to you, then I shall trust for\r\nforgiveness for having scribbled so much. I should have sent back\r\nAgassiz sooner, but my servant has been very unwell. Emma is going on\r\npretty well.\r\n\r\nMy paper on South American boulders and \"till,\" which latter deposit\r\nis perfectly characterised in Tierra del Fuego, is progressing rapidly.\r\n(499/6. \"On the Distribution of the Erratic Boulders and on the\r\nContemporaneous Unstratified Deposits of South America,\" \"Trans. Geol.\r\nSoc.\" Volume VI., page 415, 1842.)\r\n\r\nI much like the term post-Pliocene, and will use it in my present paper\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I should have thought that the most obvious objection to the\r\nmarine-beach theory for Glen Roy would be the limited extension of the\r\nshelves. Though certainly this is not a valid one, after an intermediate\r\none, only half a mile in length, and nowhere else appearing, even in the\r\nvalley of Glen Roy itself, has been shown to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 500. TO C. LYELL. 1842.\r\n\r\nI had some talk with Murchison, who has been on a flying visit into\r\nWales, and he can see no traces of glaciers, but only of the trickling\r\nof water and of the roots of the heath. It is enough to make\r\nan extraneous man think Geology from beginning to end a work of\r\nimagination, and not founded on observation. Lonsdale, I observe, pays\r\nBuckland and myself the compliment of thinking Murchison not seeing as\r\nworth nothing; but I confess I am astonished, so glaringly clear after\r\ntwo or three days did the evidence appear to me. Have you seen last \"New\r\nEdin. Phil. Journ.\", it is ice and glaciers almost from beginning to\r\nend. (500/1. \"The Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal,\" Volume XXXIII.\r\n(April-October), 1842, contains papers by Sir G.S. Mackenzie, Prof.\r\nH.G. Brown, Jean de Charpentier, Roderick Murchison, Louis Agassiz, all\r\ndealing with glaciers or ice; also letters to the Editor relating to\r\nProf. Forbes' account of his recent observations on Glaciers, and a\r\npaper by Charles Darwin entitled \"Notes on the Effects produced by the\r\nAncient Glaciers of Carnarvonshire, and on the Boulders transported by\r\nFloating Ice.\") Agassiz says he saw (and has laid down) the two lowest\r\nterraces of Glen Roy in the valley of the Spean, opposite mouth of Glen\r\nRoy itself, where no one else has seen them. (500/2. \"The Glacial Theory\r\nand its Recent Progress,\" by Louis Agassiz, loc. cit., page 216. Agassiz\r\ndescribes the parallel terraces on the flanks of Glen Roy and Glen Spean\r\n(page 236), and expresses himself convinced \"that the Glacial theory\r\nalone satisfies all the exigencies of the phenomenon\" of the parallel\r\nroads.) I carefully examined that spot, owing to the sheep tracks\r\n[being] nearly but not quite parallel to the terrace. So much, again,\r\nfor difference of observation. I do not pretend to say who is right.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 501. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 12th, 1849.\r\n\r\nI was heartily glad to get your last letter; but on my life your thanks\r\nfor my very few and very dull letters quite scalded me. I have been very\r\nindolent and selfish in not having oftener written to you and kept\r\nmy ears open for news which would have interested you; but I have not\r\nforgotten you. Two days after receiving your letter, there was a short\r\nleading notice about you in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" (501/1. The\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" 1849, page 628.); in which it is said you\r\nhave discovered a noble crimson rose and thirty rhododendrons. I must\r\nheartily congratulate you on these discoveries, which will interest\r\nthe public; and I have no doubt that you will have made plenty of most\r\ninteresting botanical observations. This last letter shall be put with\r\nall your others, which are now safe together. I am very glad that\r\nyou have got minute details about the terraces in the valleys: your\r\ndescription sounds curiously like the terraces in the Cordillera of\r\nChili; these latter, however, are single in each valley; but you will\r\nhereafter see a description of these terraces in my \"Geology of S.\r\nAmerica.\" (501/2. \"Geological Observations,\" pages 10 et passim.) At the\r\nend of your letter you speak about giving up Geology, but you must not\r\nthink of it; I am sure your observations will be very interesting. Your\r\naccount of the great dam in the Yangma valley is most curious, and quite\r\nfull; I find that I did not at all understand its wonderful structure in\r\nyour former letter. Your notion of glaciers pushing detritus into\r\ndeep fiords (and ice floating fragments on their channels), is in many\r\nrespects new to me; but I cannot help believing your dam is a lateral\r\nmoraine: I can hardly persuade myself that the remains of floating ice\r\naction, at a period so immensely remote as when the Himalaya stood at\r\na low level in the sea, would now be distinguishable. (501/3. Hooker's\r\n\"Himalayan Journals,\" Volume II., page 121, 1854. In describing certain\r\ndeposits in the Lachoong valley, Hooker writes: \"Glaciers might have\r\nforced immense beds of gravel into positions that would dam up lakes\r\nbetween the ice and the flanks of the valley\" (page 121). In a footnote\r\nhe adds: \"We are still very ignorant of many details of ice action, and\r\nespecially of the origin of many enormous deposits which are not true\r\nmoraines.\" Such deposits are referred to as occurring in the Yangma\r\nvalley.) Your not having found scored boulders and solid rocks is an\r\nobjection both to glaciers and floating ice; for it is certain that\r\nboth produce such. I believe no rocks escape scoring, polishing and\r\nmammillation in the Alps, though some lose it easily when exposed. Are\r\nyou familiar with appearance of ice-action? If I understand rightly, you\r\nobject to the great dam having been produced by a glacier, owing to the\r\ndryness of the lateral valley and general infrequency of glaciers in\r\nHimalaya; but pray observe that we may fairly (from what we see in\r\nEurope) assume that the climate was formerly colder in India, and when\r\nthe land stood at a lower height more snow might have fallen. Oddly\r\nenough, I am now inclined to believe that I saw a gigantic moraine\r\ncrossing a valley, and formerly causing a lake above it in one of the\r\ngreat valleys (Valle del Yeso) of the Cordillera: it is a mountain of\r\ndetritus, which has puzzled me. If you have any further opportunities,\r\ndo look for scores on steep faces of rock; and here and there remove\r\nturf or matted parts to have a look. Again I beg, do not give up\r\nGeology:--I wish you had Agassiz's work and plates on Glaciers. (501/4.\r\n\"Etudes sur les Glaciers.\" L. Agassiz, Neuchatel, 1840.) I am extremely\r\nsorry that the Rajah, ill luck to him, has prevented your crossing\r\nto Thibet; but you seem to have seen most interesting country: one is\r\nastonished to hear of Fuegian climate in India. I heard from the Sabines\r\nthat you were thinking of giving up Borneo; I hope that this report may\r\nprove true.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 502. TO C. LYELL. Down, May 8th [1855].\r\n\r\nThe notion you refer to was published in the \"Geological Journal\"\r\n(502/1. \"on the Transportal of Erratic Boulders from a lower to a higher\r\nLevel.\" By C. Darwin.), Volume IV. (1848), page 315, with reference to\r\nall the cases which I could collect of boulders apparently higher than\r\nthe parent rock.\r\n\r\nThe argument of probable proportion of rock dropped by sea ice compared\r\nto land glaciers is new to me. I have often thought of the idea of the\r\nviscosity and enormous momentum of great icebergs, and still think that\r\nthe notion I pointed out in appendix to Ramsay's paper is probable, and\r\ncan hardly help being applicable in some cases. (502/2. The paper by\r\nRamsay has no appendix; probably, therefore Mr. Darwin's notes were\r\npublished separately as a paper in the \"Phil. Mag.\") I wonder whether\r\nthe \"Phil. Journal [Magazine?.]\" would publish it, if I could get it\r\nfrom Ramsay or the Geological Society. (502/3. \"On the Power of Icebergs\r\nto make rectilinear, uniformly-directed grooves across a Submarine\r\nUndulatory Surface.\" By C. Darwin, \"Phil. Mag.\" Volume X., page 96,\r\n1855.) If you chance to meet Ramsay will you ask him whether he has it?\r\nI think it would perhaps be worth while just to call the N. American\r\ngeologists' attention to the idea; but it is not worth any trouble. I am\r\ntremendously busy with all sorts of experiments. By the way, Hopkins at\r\nthe Geological Society seemed to admit some truth in the idea of scoring\r\nby (viscid) icebergs. If the Geological Society takes so much [time] to\r\njudge of truth of notions, as you were telling me in regard to Ramsay's\r\nPermian glaciers (502/4. \"On the Occurrence of angular, sub-angular,\r\npolished, and striated Fragments and Boulders in the Permian Breccia\r\nof Shropshire, Worcestershire, etc.; and on the Probable Existence of\r\nGlaciers and Icebergs in the Permian Epoch.\" By A.C. Ramsay, \"Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XI., page 185, 1855.), it will be as injurious\r\nto progress as the French Institut.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 503. TO J.D. HOOKER. Cliff Cottage, Bournemouth, [September] 21st\r\n[1862].\r\n\r\nI am especially obliged to you for sending me Haast's communications.\r\n(503/1. \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XXI., pages 130, 133, 1865;\r\nVolume XXIII., page 342, 1867.) They are very interesting and grand\r\nabout glacial and drift or marine glacial. I see he alludes to the\r\nwhole southern hemisphere. I wonder whether he has read the \"Origin.\"\r\nConsidering your facts on the Alpine plants of New Zealand and remarks,\r\nI am particularly glad to hear of the geological evidence of glacial\r\naction. I presume he is sure to collect and send over the mountain rat\r\nof which he speaks. I long to know what it is. A frog and rat together\r\nwould, to my mind, prove former connection of New Zealand to some\r\ncontinent; for I can hardly suppose that the Polynesians introduced the\r\nrat as game, though so esteemed in the Friendly Islands. Ramsay sent\r\nme his paper (503/2. \"On the Glacial Origin of certain Lakes in\r\nSwitzerland, etc.\" \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XVIII., page 185,\r\n1862.) and asked my opinion on it. I agree with you and think highly of\r\nit. I cannot doubt that it is to a large extent true; my only doubt\r\nis, that in a much disturbed country, I should have thought that some\r\ndepressions, and consequently lakes, would almost certainly have been\r\nleft. I suggested a careful consideration of mountainous tropical\r\ncountries such as Brazil, peninsula of India, etc.; if lakes are there,\r\n[they are] very rare. I should fully subscribe to Ramsay's views.\r\n\r\nWhat presumption, as it seems to me, in the Council of Geological\r\nSociety that it hesitated to publish the paper.\r\n\r\nWe return home on the 30th. I have made up [my] mind, if I can keep up\r\nmy courage, to start on the Saturday for Cambridge, and stay the last\r\nfew days of the [British] Association there. I do so hope that you may\r\nbe there then.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 504. TO J.D. HOOKER. November 3rd [1864].\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote to you I had not read Ramsay. (504/1. \"On the Erosion\r\nof Valleys and Lakes: a Reply to Sir Roderick Murchison's Anniversary\r\nAddress to the Geographical Society.\" \"Phil. Mag.\" Volume XXVIII., page\r\n293, 1864) How capitally it is written! It seems that there is nothing\r\nfor style like a man's dander being put up. I think I agree largely with\r\nyou about denudation--but the rocky-lake-basin theory is the part\r\nwhich interests me at present. It seems impossible to know how much to\r\nattribute to ice, running water, and sea. I did not suppose that Ramsay\r\nwould deny that mountains had been thrown up irregularly, and that the\r\ndepressions would become valleys. The grandest valleys I ever saw were\r\nat Tahiti, and here I do not believe ice has done anything; anyhow there\r\nwere no erratics. I said in my S. American Geology (504/2. \"Finally, the\r\nconclusion at which I have arrived with respect to the relative powers\r\nof rain, and sea-water on the land is, that the latter is by far the\r\nmost efficient agent, and that its chief tendency is to widen the\r\nvalleys, whilst torrents and rivers tend to deepen them and to remove\r\nthe wreck of the sea's destroying action\" (\"Geol. Observations,\" pages\r\n66, 67).) that rivers deepen and the sea widens valleys, and I am\r\ninclined largely to stick to this, adding ice to water. I am sorry to\r\nhear that Tyndall has grown dogmatic. H. Wedgwood was saying the\r\nother day that T.'s writings and speaking gave him the idea of intense\r\nconceit. I hope it is not so, for he is a grand man of science.\r\n\r\n...I have had a prospectus and letter from Andrew Murray (504/3. See\r\nVolume II., Letters 379, 384, etc.) asking me for suggestions. I think\r\nthis almost shows he is not fit for the subject, as he gives me no idea\r\nwhat his book will be, excepting that the printed paper shows that all\r\nanimals and all plants of all groups are to be treated of. Do you know\r\nanything of his knowledge?\r\n\r\nIn about a fortnight I shall have finished, except concluding chapter,\r\nmy book on \"Variation under Domestication\"; (504/4. Published in 1868.)\r\nbut then I have got to go over the whole again, and this will take me\r\nvery many months. I am able to work about two hours daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 505. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [July, 1865].\r\n\r\nI was glad to read your article on Glaciers, etc., in Yorkshire. You\r\nseem to have been struck with what most deeply impressed me at Glen Roy\r\n(wrong as I was on the whole subject)--viz. the marvellous manner in\r\nwhich every detail of surface of land had been preserved for an enormous\r\nperiod. This makes me a little sceptical whether Ramsay, Jukes, etc.,\r\nare not a little overdoing sub-aerial denudation.\r\n\r\nIn the same \"Reader\" (505/1. Sir J.D. Hooker wrote to Darwin, July\r\n13th, 1865, from High Force Inn, Middleton, Teesdale: \"I am studying the\r\nmoraines all day long with as much enthusiasm as I am capable of after\r\nlying in bed till nine, eating heavy breakfasts, and looking forward to\r\ndinner as the summum bonum of existence.\" The result of his work, under\r\nthe title \"Moraines of the Tees Valley,\" appeared in the \"Reader\"\r\n(July 15th, 1865, page 71), of which Huxley was one of the managers\r\nor committee-men, and Norman Lockyer was scientific editor (\"Life and\r\nLetters of T.H. Huxley,\" I., page 211). Hooker describes the moraines\r\nand other evidence of glacial action in the upper part of the Tees\r\nvalley, and speaks of the effect of glaciers in determining the present\r\nphysical features of the country.) there was a striking article\r\non English and Foreign Men of Science (505/2. \"British and Foreign\r\nScience,\" \"The Reader,\" loc. cit., page 61. The writer of the article\r\nasserts the inferiority of English scientific workers.), and I think\r\nunjust to England except in pure Physiology; in biology Owen and R.\r\nBrown ought to save us, and in Geology we are most rich.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how we are reading the same books. We intend to read Lecky\r\nand certainly to re-read Buckle--which latter I admired greatly before.\r\nI am heartily glad you like Lubbock's book so much. It made me grieve\r\nhis taking to politics, and though I grieve that he has lost his\r\nelection, yet I suppose, now that he is once bitten, he will never give\r\nup politics, and science is done for. Many men can make fair M.P.'s; and\r\nhow few can work in science like him!\r\n\r\nI have been reading a pamphlet by Verlot on \"Variation of Flowers,\"\r\nwhich seems to me very good; but I doubt whether it would be worth your\r\nreading. it was published originally in the \"Journal d'Hort.,\" and\r\nso perhaps you have seen it. It is a very good plan this republishing\r\nseparately for sake of foreigners buying, and I wish I had tried to get\r\npermission of Linn. Soc. for my Climbing paper, but it is now too late.\r\n\r\nDo not forget that you have my paper on hybridism, by Max Wichura.\r\n(505/3. Wichura, M.E., \"L'Hybridisation dans le regne vegetal etudiee\r\nsur les Saules,\" \"Arch. Sci. Phys. Nat.\" XXIII., page 129, 1865.)\r\n\r\nI hope you are returned to your work, refreshed like a giant by your\r\nhuge breakfasts. How unlucky you are about contagious complaints with\r\nyour children!\r\n\r\nI keep very weak, and had much sickness yesterday, but am stronger this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nCan you remember how we ever first met? (505/4. See \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 19.) It was in Park Street; but what brought us together? I\r\nhave been re-reading a few old letters of yours, and my heart is very\r\nwarm towards you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 506. TO C. LYELL. Down, March 8th [1866].\r\n\r\n(506/1. In a letter from Sir Joseph Hooker to Mr. Darwin on February\r\n21st, 1866, the following passage occurs: \"I wish I could explain to you\r\nmy crude notions as to the Glacial period and your position towards it.\r\nI suppose I hold this doctrine: that there was a Glacial period, but\r\nthat it was not one of universal cold, because I think that the\r\nexisting distribution of glaciers is sufficiently demonstrative of the\r\nproposition that by comparatively slight redispositions of sea and\r\nland, and perhaps axis of globe, you may account for all the leading\r\npalaeontological phenomena.\" This letter was sent by Mr. Darwin to Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, and the latter, writing on March 1st, 1866, expresses\r\nhis belief that \"the whole globe must at times have been superficially\r\ncooler. Still,\" he adds, \"during extreme excentricity the sun would make\r\ngreat efforts to compensate in perihelion for the chill of a long winter\r\nin aphelion in one hemisphere, and a cool summer in the other. I\r\nthink you will turn out to be right in regard to meridional lines of\r\nmountain-chains by which the migrations across the equator took place\r\nwhile there was contemporaneous tropical heat of certain lowlands, where\r\nplants requiring heat and moisture were saved from extinction by the\r\nheat of the earth's surface, which was stored up in perihelion, being\r\nprevented from radiating off freely into space by a blanket of aqueous\r\nvapour caused by the melting of ice and snow. But though I am inclined\r\nto profit by Croll's maximum excentricity for the glacial period, I\r\nconsider it quite subordinate to geographical causes or the relative\r\nposition of land and sea and the abnormal excess of land in polar\r\nregions.\" In another letter (March 5th, 1866) Lyell writes: \"In the\r\nbeginning of Hooker's letter to you he speaks hypothetically of a change\r\nin the earth's axis as having possibly co-operated with redistribution\r\nof land and sea in causing the cold of the Glacial period. Now, when we\r\nconsider how extremely modern, zoologically and botanically, the Glacial\r\nperiod is proved to be, I am shocked at any one introducing, with what I\r\nmay call so much levity, so organic a change as a deviation in the axis\r\nof the planet...' (see Lyell's \"Principles,\" 1875, Chapter XIII.; also a\r\nletter to Sir Joseph Hooker printed in the \"Life of Sir Charles Lyell,\"\r\nVolume II., page 410.))\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your interesting letter. From the serene elevation of\r\nmy old age I look down with amazement at your youth, vigour, and\r\nindomitable energy. With respect to Hooker and the axis of the earth, I\r\nsuspect he is too much overworked to consider now any subject properly.\r\nHis mind is so acute and critical that I always expect to hear a torrent\r\nof objections to anything proposed; but he is so candid that he often\r\ncomes round in a year or two. I have never thought on the causes of the\r\nGlacial period, for I feel that the subject is beyond me; but though I\r\nhope you will own that I have generally been a good and docile pupil\r\nto you, yet I must confess that I cannot believe in change of land and\r\nwater, being more than a subsidiary agent. (506/2. In Chapter XI. of the\r\n\"Origin,\" Edition V., 1869, page 451, Darwin discusses Croll's theory,\r\nand is clearly inclined to trust in Croll's conclusion that \"whenever\r\nthe northern hemisphere passes through a cold period the temperature of\r\nthe southern hemisphere is actually raised...\" In Edition VI., page 336,\r\nhe expresses his faith even more strongly. Mr. Darwin apparently sent\r\nhis MS. on the climate question, which was no doubt prepared for a\r\nnew edition of the \"Origin,\" to Sir Charles. The arrival of the MS. is\r\nacknowledged in a letter from Lyell on March 10th, 1866 (\"Life of Sir\r\nCharles Lyell,\" II., page 408), in which the writer says that he is\r\n\"more than ever convinced that geographical changes...are the principal\r\nand not the subsidiary causes.\") I have come to this conclusion from\r\nreflecting on the geographical distribution of the inhabitants of the\r\nsea on the opposite sides of our continents and of the inhabitants of\r\nthe continents themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 507. TO C. LYELL. Down, September 8th [1866].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the pamphlet, which was returned this morning. I was\r\nvery glad to read it, though chiefly as a psychological curiosity. I\r\nquite follow you in thinking Agassiz glacier-mad. (507/1. Agassiz's\r\npamphlet, (\"Geology of the Amazons\") is referred to by Lyell in a letter\r\nwritten to Bunbury in September, 1866 (\"Life of Sir Charles Lyell,\" II.,\r\npage 409): \"Agassiz has written an interesting paper on the 'Geology of\r\nthe Amazons,' but, I regret to say, he has gone wild about glaciers, and\r\nhas actually announced his opinion that the whole of the great valley,\r\ndown to its mouth in latitude 0 deg., was filled by ice...\" Agassiz\r\npublished a paper, \"Observations Geologiques faites dans la Vallee de\r\nl'Amazone,\" in the \"Comptes Rendus,\" Volume LXIV., page 1269, 1867. See\r\nalso a letter addressed to M. Marcou, published in the \"Bull. Soc. Geol.\r\nFrance,\" Volume XXIV., page 109, 1866.) His evidence reduces itself to\r\nsupposed moraines, which would be difficult to trace in a forest-clad\r\ncountry; and with respect to boulders, these are not said to be angular,\r\nand their source cannot be known in a country so imperfectly explored.\r\nWhen I was at Rio, I was continually astonished at the depth (sometimes\r\n100 feet) to which the granitic rocks were decomposed in situ, and this\r\nsoft matter would easily give rise to great alluvial accumulations; I\r\nwell remember finding it difficult to draw a line between the alluvial\r\nmatter and the softened rock in situ. What a splendid imagination\r\nAgassiz has, and how energetic he is! What capital work he would have\r\ndone, if he had sucked in your \"Principles\" with his mother's milk. It\r\nis wonderful that he should have written such wild nonsense about the\r\nvalley of the Amazon; yet not so wonderful when one remembers that he\r\nonce maintained before the British Association that the chalk was all\r\ndeposited at once.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the insects of Chili, I knew only from Bates that the\r\nspecies of Carabus showed no special affinity to northern species;\r\nfrom the great difference of climate and vegetation I should not have\r\nexpected that many insects would have shown such affinity. It is more\r\nremarkable that the birds on the broad and lofty Cordillera of Tropical\r\nS. America show no affinity with European species. The little power of\r\ndiffusion with birds has often struck me as a most singular fact--even\r\nmore singular than the great power of diffusion with plants. Remember\r\nthat we hope to see you in the autumn.\r\n\r\nP.S.--There is a capital paper in the September number of \"Annals\r\nand Magazine,\" translated from Pictet and Humbert, on Fossil Fish of\r\nLebanon, but you will, I daresay, have received the original. (507/2.\r\n\"Recent Researches on the Fossil Fishes of Mount Lebanon,\" \"Ann. Mag.\r\nNat. Hist.\" Volume XVIII., page 237, 1866.) It is capital in relation to\r\nmodification of species; I would not wish for more confirmatory facts,\r\nthough there is no direct allusion to the modification of species.\r\nHooker, by the way, gave an admirable lecture at Nottingham; I read it\r\nin MS., or rather, heard it. I am glad it will be published, for it was\r\ncapital. (507/3. Sir Joseph Hooker delivered a lecture at the Nottingham\r\nmeeting of the British Association (1866) on \"Insular Floras,\" published\r\nin the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" 1867. See Letters 366-377, etc.)\r\n\r\nSunday morning.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have just received a letter from Asa Gray with the following\r\npassage, so that, according to this, I am the chief cause of Agassiz's\r\nabsurd views:--\r\n\r\n\"Agassiz is back (I have not seen him), and he went at once down to the\r\nNational Academy of Sciences, from which I sedulously keep away, and, I\r\nhear, proved to them that the Glacial period covered the whole continent\r\nof America with unbroken ice, and closed with a significant gesture and\r\nthe remark: 'So here is the end of the Darwin theory.' How do you like\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n\"I said last winter that Agassiz was bent on covering the whole\r\ncontinent with ice, and that the motive of the discovery he was sure\r\nto make was to make sure that there should be no coming down of any\r\nterrestrial life from Tertiary or post-Tertiary period to ours. You\r\ncannot deny that he has done his work effectually in a truly imperial\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 508. TO C. LYELL. Down, July 14th, 1868.\r\n\r\nMr. Agassiz's book has been read aloud to me, and I am wonderfully\r\nperplexed what to think about his precise statements of the existence of\r\nglaciers in the Ceara Mountains, and about the drift formation near Rio.\r\n(508/1. \"Sur la Geologie de l'Amazone,\" by MM. Agassiz and Continho,\r\n\"Bull. Soc. Geol. France,\" Volume XXV., page 685, 1868. See also \"A\r\nJourney in Brazil,\" by Professor and Mrs. Louis Agassiz, Boston, 1868.)\r\nThere is a sad want of details. Thus he never mentions whether any of\r\nthe blocks are angular, nor whether the embedded rounded boulders, which\r\ncannot all be disintegrated, are scored. Yet how can so experienced an\r\nobserver as A. be deceived about lateral and terminal moraines? If there\r\nreally were glaciers in the Ceara Mountains, it seems to me one of the\r\nmost important facts in the history of the inorganic and organic world\r\never observed. Whether true or not, it will be widely believed, and\r\nuntil finally decided will greatly interfere with future progress\r\non many points. I have made these remarks in the hope that you will\r\ncoincide. If so, do you think it would be possible to persuade some\r\nknown man, such as Ramsay, or, what would be far better, some two men,\r\nto go out for a summer trip, which would be in many respects delightful,\r\nfor the sole object of observing these phenomena in the Ceara Mountains,\r\nand if possible also near Rio? I would gladly put my name down for 50\r\npounds in aid of the expense of travelling. Do turn this over in your\r\nmind. I am so very sorry not to have seen you this summer, but for the\r\nlast three weeks I have been good for nothing, and have had to stop\r\nalmost all work. I hope we may meet in the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 509. TO JAMES CROLL. Down, November 24th, 1868.\r\n\r\nI have read with the greatest interest the last paper which you have\r\nkindly sent me. (509/1. Croll discussed the power of icebergs as\r\ngrinding and striating agents in the latter part of a paper (\"On\r\nGeological Time, and the probable Dates of the Glacial and the Upper\r\nMiocene Period\") published in the \"Philosophical Magazine,\" Volume\r\nXXXV., page 363, 1868, Volume XXXVI., pages 141, 362, 1868. His\r\nconclusion was that the advocates of the Iceberg theory had formed \"too\r\nextravagant notions regarding the potency of floating ice as a striating\r\nagent.\") If we are to admit that all the scored rocks throughout the\r\nmore level parts of the United States result from true glacier action,\r\nit is a most wonderful conclusion, and you certainly make out a very\r\nstrong case; so I suppose I must give up one more cherished belief. But\r\nmy object in writing is to trespass on your kindness and ask a question,\r\nwhich I daresay I could answer for myself by reading more carefully,\r\nas I hope hereafter to do, all your papers; but I shall feel much more\r\nconfidence in a brief reply from you. Am I right in supposing that you\r\nbelieve that the glacial periods have always occurred alternately in the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres, so that the erratic deposits which I\r\nhave described in the southern parts of America, and the glacial work in\r\nNew Zealand, could not have been simultaneous with our Glacial period?\r\nFrom the glacial deposits occurring all round the northern hemisphere,\r\nand from such deposits appearing in S. America to be as recent as in the\r\nnorth, and lastly, from there being some evidence of the former lower\r\ndescent of glaciers all along the Cordilleras, I inferred that the whole\r\nworld was at this period cooler. It did not appear to me justifiable\r\nwithout distinct evidence to suppose that the N. and S. glacial deposits\r\nbelonged to distinct epochs, though it would have been an immense\r\nrelief to my mind if I could have assumed that this had been the\r\ncase. Secondly, do you believe that during the Glacial period in one\r\nhemisphere the opposite hemisphere actually becomes warmer, or does\r\nit merely retain the same temperature as before? I do not ask these\r\nquestions out of mere curiosity; but I have to prepare a new edition\r\nof my \"Origin of Species,\" and am anxious to say a few words on this\r\nsubject on your authority. I hope that you will excuse my troubling you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 510. TO J. CROLL. Down, January 31st, 1869.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow I will return registered your book, which I have kept so long.\r\nI am most sincerely obliged for its loan, and especially for the MS.,\r\nwithout which I should have been afraid of making mistakes. If you\r\nrequire it, the MS. shall be returned. Your results have been of more\r\nuse to me than, I think, any other set of papers which I can remember.\r\nSir C. Lyell, who is staying here, is very unwilling to admit the\r\ngreater warmth of the S. hemisphere during the Glacial period in the N.;\r\nbut, as I have told him, this conclusion which you have arrived at from\r\nphysical considerations, explains so well whole classes of facts in\r\ndistribution, that I must joyfully accept it; indeed, I go so far as to\r\nthink that your conclusion is strengthened by the facts in distribution.\r\nYour discussion on the flowing of the great ice-cap southward is\r\nmost interesting. I suppose that you have read Mr. Moseley's recent\r\ndiscussion on the force of gravity being quite insufficient to account\r\nfor the downward movement of glaciers (510/1. Canon Henry Moseley, \"On\r\nthe Mechanical Impossibility of the Descent of Glaciers by their Weight\r\nonly.\" \"Proc. R. Soc.\" Volume XVII., page 202, 1869; \"Phil. Mag.\" Volume\r\nXXXVII., page 229, 1869.): if he is right, do you not think that the\r\nunknown force may make more intelligible the extension of the great\r\nnorthern ice-cap? Notwithstanding your excellent remarks on the work\r\nwhich can be effected within the million years (510/2. In his paper\r\n\"On Geological Time, and the probable Date of the Glacial and the Upper\r\nMiocene Period\" (\"Phil. Mag.\" Volume XXXV., page 363, 1868), Croll\r\nendeavours to convey to the mind some idea of what a million years\r\nreally is: \"Take a narrow strip of paper, an inch broad or more, and 83\r\nfeet 4 inches in length, and stretch it along the wall of a large hall,\r\nor round the walls of an apartment somewhat over 20 feet square.\r\nRecall to memory the days of your boyhood, so as to get some adequate\r\nconception of what a period of a hundred years is. Then mark off from\r\none of the ends of the strip one-tenth of an inch. The one-tenth of an\r\ninch will then represent a hundred years, and the entire length of the\r\nstrip a million of years\" (loc. cit., page 375).), I am greatly troubled\r\nat the short duration of the world according to Sir W. Thomson (510/3.\r\nIn a paper communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Lord Kelvin\r\n(then Sir William Thomson) stated his belief that the age of our planet\r\nmust be more than twenty millions of years, but not more than four\r\nhundred millions of years (\"Trans. R. Soc. Edinb.\" Volume XXIII., page\r\n157, 1861, \"On the Secular Cooling of the Earth.\"). This subject has\r\nbeen recently dealt with by Sir Archibald Geikie in his address as\r\nPresident of the Geological Section of the British Association, 1899\r\n(\"Brit. Assoc. Report,\" Dover Meeting, 1899, page 718).), for I\r\nrequire for my theoretical views a very long period BEFORE the Cambrian\r\nformation. If it would not trouble you, I should like to hear what you\r\nthink of Lyell's remark on the magnetic force which comes from the sun\r\nto the earth: might not this penetrate the crust of the earth and then\r\nbe converted into heat? This would give a somewhat longer time during\r\nwhich the crust might have been solid; and this is the argument on which\r\nSir W. Thomson seems chiefly to rest. You seem to argue chiefly on\r\nthe expenditure of energy of all kinds by the sun, and in this respect\r\nLyell's remark would have no bearing.\r\n\r\nMy new edition of the \"Origin\" (510/4. Fifth edition, May, 1869.) will\r\nbe published, I suppose, in about two months, and for the chance of your\r\nliking to have a copy I will send one.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I wish that you would turn your astronomical knowledge to the\r\nconsideration whether the form of the globe does not become periodically\r\nslightly changed, so as to account for the many repeated ups and downs\r\nof the surface in all parts of the world. I have always thought that\r\nsome cosmical cause would some day be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 511. TO C. LYELL. Down, July 12th [1872].\r\n\r\nI have been glad to see the enclosed and return it. It seems to me\r\nvery cool in Agassiz to doubt the recent upheaval of Patagonia, without\r\nhaving visited any part; and he entirely misrepresents me in saying that\r\nI infer upheaval from the form of the land, as I trusted entirely to\r\nshells embedded and on the surface. It is simply monstrous to suppose\r\nthat the terraces stretching on a dead level for leagues along the\r\ncoast, and miles in breadth, and covered with beds of stratified gravel,\r\n10 to 30 feet in thickness, are due to subaerial denudation.\r\n\r\nAs for the pond of salt-water twice or thrice the density of sea-water,\r\nand nearly dry, containing sea-shells in the same relative proportions\r\nas on the adjoining coast, it almost passes my belief. Could there have\r\nbeen a lively midshipman on board, who in the morning stocked the pool\r\nfrom the adjoining coast?\r\n\r\nAs for glaciation, I will not venture to express any opinion, for when\r\nin S. America I knew nothing about glaciers, and perhaps attributed much\r\nto icebergs which ought to be attributed to glaciers. On the other hand,\r\nAgassiz seems to me mad about glaciers, and apparently never thinks of\r\ndrift ice.\r\n\r\nI did see one clear case of former great extension of a glacier in T.\r\ndel Fuego.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 512. TO J. GEIKIE.\r\n\r\n(512/1. The following letter was in reply to a request from Prof. James\r\nGeikie for permission to publish Mr. Darwin's views, communicated in a\r\nprevious letter (November 1876), on the vertical position of stones in\r\ngravelly drift near Southampton. Prof. Geikie wrote (July 15th, 1880):\r\n\"You may remember that you attributed the peculiar position of those\r\nstones to differential movements in the drift itself arising from the\r\nslow melting of beds of frozen snow interstratified into the gravels...I\r\nhave found this explanation of great service even in Scotland, and\r\nfrom what I have seen of the drift-gravels in various parts of southern\r\nEngland and northern France, I am inclined to think that it has a wide\r\napplication.\")\r\n\r\nDown, July 19th, 1880.\r\n\r\nYour letter has pleased me very much, and I truly feel it an honour that\r\nanything which I wrote on the drift, etc., should have been of the least\r\nuse or interest to you. Pray make any use of my letter (512/2. Professor\r\nJames Geikie quotes the letter in \"Prehistoric Europe,\" London, 1881\r\n(page 141). Practically the whole of it is given in the \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., page 213.): I forget whether it was written carefully or\r\nclearly, so pray touch up any passages that you may think fit to quote.\r\n\r\nAll that I have seen since near Southampton and elsewhere has\r\nstrengthened my notion. Here I live on a chalk platform gently sloping\r\ndown from the edge of the escarptment to the south (512/3. Id est,\r\nsloping down from the escarpment which is to the south.) (which is\r\nabout 800 feet in height) to beneath the Tertiary beds to the north. The\r\n(512/4. From here to the end of the paragraph is quoted by Prof. Geikie,\r\nloc. cit., page 142.) beds of the large and broad valleys (and only of\r\nthese) are covered with an immense mass of closely packed broken and\r\nangular flints; in which mass the skull of the musk-ox [musk-sheep]\r\nand woolly elephant have been found. This great accumulation of unworn\r\nflints must therefore have been made when the climate was cold, and I\r\nbelieve it can be accounted for by the larger valleys having been filled\r\nup to a great depth during a large part of the year with drifted frozen\r\nsnow, over which rubbish from the upper parts of the platforms was\r\nwashed by the summer rains, sometimes along one line and sometimes along\r\nanother, or in channels cut through the snow all along the main course\r\nof the broad valleys.\r\n\r\nI suppose that I formerly mentioned to you the frequent upright position\r\nof elongated flints in the red clayey residue over the chalk, which\r\nresidue gradually subsides into the troughs and pipes corroded in the\r\nsolid chalk. This letter is very untidy, but I am tired.\r\n\r\nP.S. Several palaeolithic celts have recently been found in the great\r\nangular gravel-bed near Southampton in several places.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 513. TO D. MACKINTOSH. Down, November 13th, 1880.\r\n\r\nYour discovery is a very interesting one, and I congratulate you on\r\nit. (513/1. \"On the Precise Mode of Accumulation and Derivation of the\r\nMoel-Tryfan Shelly Deposits; on the Discovery of Similar High-level\r\nDeposits along the Eastern Slopes of the Welsh Mountains; and on the\r\nExistence of Drift-Zones, showing probable Variations in the Rate\r\nof Submergence.\" By D. Mackintosh, \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume\r\nXXXVII., pages 351-69, 1881. [Read April 27th, 1881.]) I failed to find\r\nshells on Moel Tryfan, but was interested by finding (\"Philosoph. Mag.\"\r\n3rd series, Volume XXI., page 184) shattered rocks (513/2. In reviewing\r\nthe work by previous writers on the Moel-Tryfan deposits, Mackintosh\r\nrefers to Darwin's \"very suggestive description of the Moel-Tryfan\r\ndeposits...Under the drift he saw that the surface of the slate, TO\r\nA DEPTH OF SEVERAL FEET, HAD BEEN SHATTERED AND CONTORTED IN A VERY\r\nPECULIAR MANNER.\" The contortion of the slate, which Mackintosh\r\nregarded as \"the most interesting of the Moel-Tryfan phenomena,\" had not\r\npreviously been regarded as \"sufficiently striking to arrest attention\"\r\nby any geologist except Darwin. The Pleistocene gravel and sand\r\ncontaining marine shells on Moel-Tryfan, about five miles south-east of\r\nCaernarvon, have been the subject of considerable controversy. By some\r\ngeologists the drift deposits have been regarded as evidence of a great\r\nsubmergence in post-Pliocene times, while others have explained their\r\noccurrence at a height of 1300 feet by assuming that the gravel and sand\r\nhad been thrust uphill by an advancing ice-sheet. (See H.B. Woodward,\r\n\"Geology of England and Wales,\" Edition II., 1887, pages 491, 492.)\r\nDarwin attributed the shattering and contorting of the slates below the\r\ndrift to \"icebergs grating over the surface.\") and far-distant rounded\r\nboulders, which I attributed to the violent impact of icebergs or\r\ncoast-ice. I can offer no opinion on whether the more recent changes of\r\nlevel in England were or were not accompanied by earthquakes. It does\r\nnot seem to me a correct expression (which you use probably from\r\nhaste in your note) to speak of elevations or depressions as caused\r\nby earthquakes: I suppose that every one admits that an earthquake\r\nis merely the vibration from the fractured crust when it yields to an\r\nupward or downward force. I must confess that of late years I have often\r\nbegun to suspect (especially when I think of the step-like plains of\r\nPatagonia, the heights of which were measured by me) that many of the\r\nchanges of level in the land are due to changes of level in the sea.\r\n(513/3. This view is an agreement with the theory recently put forward\r\nby Suess in his \"Antlitz der Erde\" (Prag and Leipzig, 1885). Suess\r\nbelieves that \"the local invasions and transgressions of the continental\r\nareas by the sea\" are due to \"secular movements of the hydrosphere\r\nitself.\" (See J. Geikie, F.R.S., Presidential Address before Section E\r\nat the Edinburgh Meeting of the British Association, \"Annual Report,\"\r\npage 794.) I suppose that there can be no doubt that when there was much\r\nice piled up in the Arctic regions the sea would be attracted to them,\r\nand the land on the temperate regions would thus appear to have risen.\r\nThere would also be some lowering of the sea by evaporation and the\r\nfixing of the water as ice near the Pole.\r\n\r\nI shall read your paper with much interest when published.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 514. TO J. GEIKIE. Down, December 13th, 1880.\r\n\r\nYou must allow me the pleasure of thanking you for the great interest\r\nwith which I have read your \"Prehistoric Europe.\" (514/1. \"Prehistoric\r\nEurope: a Geological Sketch,\" London, 1881.) Nothing has struck me more\r\nthan the accumulated evidence of interglacial periods, and assuredly\r\nthe establishment of such periods is of paramount importance for\r\nunderstanding all the later changes of the earth's surface. Reading\r\nyour book has brought vividly before my mind the state of knowledge, or\r\nrather ignorance, half a century ago, when all superficial matter was\r\nclassed as diluvium, and not considered worthy of the attention of a\r\ngeologist. If you can spare the time (though I ask out of mere idle\r\ncuriosity) I should like to hear what you think of Mr. Mackintosh's\r\npaper, illustrated by a little map with lines showing the courses or\r\nsources of the erratic boulders over the midland counties of England.\r\n(514/2. \"Results of a Systematic Survey, in 1878, of the Directions and\r\nLimits of Dispersion, Mode of Occurrence, and Relation to Drift-Deposits\r\nof the Erratic Blocks or Boulders of the West of England and East of\r\nWales, including a Revision of Many Years' Previous Observations,\" D.\r\nMackintosh, \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XXXV., page 425, 1879.) It\r\nis a little suspicious their ending rather abruptly near Wolverhampton,\r\nyet I must think that they were transported by floating ice. Fifty years\r\nago I knew Shropshire well, and cannot remember anything like till, but\r\nabundance of gravel and sand beds, with recent marine shells. A great\r\nboulder (514/3. Mackintosh alludes (loc. cit., page 442) to felstone\r\nboulders around Ashley Heath, the highest ground between the Pennine and\r\nWelsh Hills north of the Wrekin; also to a boulder on the summit of the\r\neminence (774 feet above sea-level), \"probably the same as that noticed\r\nmany years ago by Mr. Darwin.\" In a later paper, \"On the Correlation\r\nof the Drift-Deposits of the North-West of England with those of the\r\nMidland and Eastern Counties\" (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XXXVI.,\r\npage 178, 1880) Mackintosh mentions a letter received from Darwin, \"who\r\nwas the first to elucidate the boulder-transporting agency of floating\r\nice,\" containing an account of the great Ashley Heath boulder, which\r\nhe was the first to discover and expose,...so as to find that the block\r\nrested on fragments of New Red Sandstone, one of which was split into\r\ntwo and deeply scored...The facts mentioned in the letter from Mr.\r\nDarwin would seem to show that the boulder must have fallen through\r\nwater from floating ice with a force sufficient to split the underlying\r\nlump of sandstone, but not sufficient to crush it.\") which I had\r\nundermined on the summit of Ashley Heath, 720 (?) feet above the sea,\r\nrested on clean blocks of the underlying red sandstone. I was also\r\ngreatly interested by your long discussion on the Loss (514/4. For an\r\naccount of the Loss of German geologists--\"a fine-grained, more or less\r\nhomogeneous, consistent, non-plastic loam, consisting of an intimate\r\nadmixture of clay and carbonate of lime,\" see J. Geikie, loc. cit., page\r\n144 et seq.); but I do not feel satisfied that all has been made\r\nout about it. I saw much brick-earth near Southampton in some manner\r\nconnected with the angular gravel, but had not strength enough to\r\nmake out relations. It might be worth your while to bear in mind the\r\npossibility of fine sediment washed over and interstratified with thick\r\nbeds of frozen snow, and therefore ultimately dropped irrespective of\r\nthe present contour of the country.\r\n\r\nI remember as a boy that it was said that the floods of the Severn were\r\nmore muddy when the floods were caused by melting snow than from the\r\nheaviest rains; but why this should be I cannot see.\r\n\r\nAnother subject has interested me much--viz. the sliding and travelling\r\nof angular debris. Ever since seeing the \"streams of stones\" at the\r\nFalkland Islands (514/5. \"Geological Observations on South America\"\r\n(1846), page 19 et seq.), I have felt uneasy in my mind on this subject.\r\nI wish Mr. Kerr's notion could be fully elucidated about frozen snow.\r\nSome one ought to observe the movements of the fields of snow which\r\nsupply the glaciers in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nYours is a grand book, and I thank you heartily for the instruction and\r\npleasure which it has given me.\r\n\r\nFor heaven's sake forgive the untidiness of this whole note.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 515. TO JOHN LUBBOCK [Lord Avebury]. Down, November 6th, 1881.\r\n\r\nIf I had written your Address (515/1. Address delivered by Lord Avebury\r\nas President of the British Association at York in 1881. Dr. Hicks\r\nis mentioned as having classed the pre-Cambrian strata in \"four great\r\ngroups of immense thickness and implying a great lapse of time\" and\r\ngiving no evidence of life. Hicks' third formation was named by him the\r\nArvonian (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XXXVII., 1881, Proc., page\r\n55.) (but this requires a fearful stretch of imagination on my part) I\r\nshould not alter what I had said about Hicks. You have the support of\r\nthe President [of the] Geological Society (515/2. Robert Etheridge.),\r\nand I think that Hicks is more likely to be right than X. The latter\r\nseems to me to belong to the class of objectors general. If Hicks should\r\nbe hereafter proved to be wrong about this third formation, it would\r\nsignify very little to you.\r\n\r\nI forget whether you go as far as to support Ramsay about lakes as large\r\nas the Italian ones: if so, I would myself modify the passage a little,\r\nfor these great lakes have always made me tremble for Ramsay, yet\r\nsome of the American geologists support him about the still larger N.\r\nAmerican lakes. I have always believed in the main in Ramsay's views\r\nfrom the date of publication, and argued the point with Lyell, and am\r\nconvinced that it is a very interesting step in Geology, and that you\r\nwere quite right to allude to it. (515/3. \"Glacial Origin of Lakes in\r\nSwitzerland, Black Forest, etc.\" (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume\r\nXVIII., pages 185-204, 1862). Sir John Lubbock (Lord Avebury) gives\r\na brief statement of Ramsay's views concerning the origin of lakes\r\n(Presidential Address, Brit. Assoc. 1881, page 22): \"Prof. Ramsay\r\ndivides lakes into three classes: (1) Those which are due to irregular\r\naccumulations of drift, and which are generally quite shallow; (2) those\r\nwhich are formed by moraines; and (3) those which occupy true basins\r\nscooped by glaciers out of the solid rocks. To the latter class belong,\r\nin his opinion, most of the great Swiss and Italian lakes...Professor\r\nRamsay's theory seems, therefore, to account for a large number of\r\ninteresting facts.\" Sir Archibald Geikie has given a good summary of\r\nRamsay's theory in his \"Memoir of Sir Andrew Crombie Ramsay,\" page 361,\r\nLondon, 1895.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 516. TO D. MACKINTOSH. Down, February 28th, 1882.\r\n\r\nI have read professor Geikie's essay, and it certainly appears to\r\nme that he underrated the importance of floating ice. (516/1. \"The\r\nIntercrossing of Erratics in Glacial Deposits,\" by James Geikie,\r\n\"Scottish Naturalist,\" 1881.) Memory extending back for half a century\r\nis worth a little, but I can remember nothing in Shropshire like till\r\nor ground moraine, yet I can distinctly remember the appearance of many\r\nsand and gravel beds--in some of which I found marine shells. I think it\r\nwould be well worth your while to insist (but perhaps you have done so)\r\non the absence of till, if absent in the Western Counties, where you\r\nfind many erratic boulders.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to read the last sentence in Geikie's essay about the\r\nvalue of your work. (516/2. The concluding paragraph reads as follows:\r\n\"I cannot conclude this paper without expressing my admiration for the\r\nlong-continued and successful labours of the well-known geologist whose\r\nviews I have been controverting. Although I entered my protest against\r\nhis iceberg hypothesis, and have freely criticised his theoretical\r\nopinions, I most willingly admit that the results of his unwearied\r\ndevotion to the study of those interesting phenomena with which he is\r\nso familiar have laid all his fellow-workers under a debt of gratitude.\"\r\nMr. Darwin used to speak with admiration of Mackintosh's work, carried\r\non as it was under considerable difficulties.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the main purport of your note, I hardly know what to\r\nsay. Though no evidence worth anything has as yet, in my opinion, been\r\nadvanced in favour of a living being, being developed from inorganic\r\nmatter, yet I cannot avoid believing the possibility of this will be\r\nproved some day in accordance with the law of continuity. I remember the\r\ntime, above fifty years ago, when it was said that no substance found\r\nin a living plant or animal could be produced without the aid of vital\r\nforces. As far as external form is concerned, Eozoon shows how difficult\r\nit is to distinguish between organised and inorganised bodies. If it is\r\never found that life can originate on this world, the vital phenomena\r\nwill come under some general law of nature. Whether the existence of a\r\nconscious God can be proved from the existence of the so-called laws\r\nof nature (i.e., fixed sequence of events) is a perplexing subject, on\r\nwhich I have often thought, but cannot see my way clearly. If you have\r\nnot read W. Graham's \"Creed of Science,\" (516/3. \"The Creed of Science:\r\nReligious, Moral, and Social,\" London, 1881.), it would, I think,\r\ninterest you, and he supports the view which you are inclined to uphold.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.IX.III. THE PARALLEL ROADS OF GLEN ROY, 1841-1880.\r\n\r\n(517/1. In the bare hilly country of Lochaber, in the Scotch Highlands,\r\nthe slopes of the mountains overlooking the vale of Glen Roy are marked\r\nby narrow terraces or parallel roads, which sweep round the shoulders of\r\nthe hills with \"undeviating horizontality.\" These roads are described\r\nby Sir Archibald Geikie as having long been \"a subject of wonderment and\r\nlegendary story among the Highlanders, and for so many years a source\r\nof sore perplexity among men of science.\" (517/2. \"The Scenery of\r\nScotland,\" 1887, page 266.) In Glen Roy itself there are three distinct\r\nshelves or terraces, and the mountain sides of the valley of the Spean\r\nand other glens bear traces of these horizontal \"roads.\"\r\n\r\nThe first important papers dealing with the origin of this striking\r\nphysical feature were those of MacCulloch (517/3. \"Trans. Geol. Soc.\"\r\nVolume IV., page 314, 1817.) and Sir Thomas Lauder Dick (517/4. \"Trans.\r\nR. Soc. Edinb.\" Volume IX., page 1, 1823.), in which the writers\r\nconcluded that the roads were the shore-lines of lakes which once filled\r\nthe Lochaber valleys. Towards the end of June 1838 Mr. Darwin devoted\r\n\"eight good days\" (517/5. \"Life and Letters,\" I., page 290.) to the\r\nexamination of the Lochaber district, and in the following year he\r\ncommunicated a paper to the Royal Society of London, in which he\r\nattributed their origin to the action of the sea, and regarded them\r\nas old sea beaches which had been raised to their present level by a\r\ngradual elevation of the Lochaber district.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Louis Agassiz and Buckland (517/6. \"Edinb. New Phil. Journal,\"\r\nVolume XXXIII., page 236, 1842.) proposed the glacier-ice theory; they\r\ndescribed the valleys as having been filled with lakes dammed back by\r\nglaciers which formed bars across the valleys of Glen Roy, Glen\r\nSpean, and the other glens in which the hill-sides bear traces of old\r\nlake-margins. Agassiz wrote in 1842: \"When I visited the parallel roads\r\nof Glen Roy with Dr. Buckland we were convinced that the glacial theory\r\nalone satisfied all the exigencies of the phenomenon.\" (517/7. Ibid.,\r\npage 236.)\r\n\r\nMr. David Milne (afterwards Milne-Home) (517/8. \"Trans. R. Soc. Edinb.\"\r\nVolume XVI., page 395, 1847.) in 1847 upheld the view that the ledges\r\nrepresent the shore-lines of lakes which were imprisoned in the valleys\r\nby dams of detrital material left in the glens during a submergence\r\nof 3,000 feet, at the close of the Glacial period. Chambers, in his\r\n\"Ancient Sea Margins\" (1848), expressed himself in agreement with Mr.\r\nDarwin's marine theory. The Agassiz-Buckland theory was supported by\r\nMr. Jamieson (517/9. \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XIX., page 235,\r\n1863.), who brought forward additional evidence in favour of the glacial\r\nbarriers. Sir Charles Lyell at first (517/10. \"Elements of Geology,\"\r\nEdition II., 1841.) accepted the explanation given by Mr. Darwin, but\r\nafterwards (517/11. \"Antiquity of Man,\" 1863, pages 252 et seq.) came to\r\nthe conclusion that the terrace-lines represent the beaches of glacial\r\nlakes. In a paper published in 1878 (517/12. \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\"\r\n1879, page 663.), Prof. Prestwich stated his acceptance of the lake\r\ntheory of MacCulloch and Sir T. Lauder Dick and of the glacial theory\r\nof Agassiz, but differed from these authors in respect of the age of the\r\nlakes and the manner of formation of the roads.\r\n\r\nThe view that has now gained general acceptance is that the parallel\r\nroads of Glen Roy represent the shores of a lake \"that came into being\r\nwith the growth of the glaciers and vanished as these melted away.\"\r\n(517/13. Sir Archibald Geikie, loc. cit., page 269.)\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin became a convert to the glacier theory after the publication\r\nof Mr. Jamieson's paper. He speaks of his own paper as \"a great\r\nfailure\"; he argued in favour of sea action as the cause of the terraces\r\n\"because no other explanation was possible under our then state of\r\nknowledge.\" Convinced of his mistake, Darwin looked upon his error as\r\n\"a good lesson never to trust in science to the principle of exclusion.\"\r\n(517/14. \"Life and Letters,\" I., page 69.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 517. TO C. LYELL. [March 9th, 1841.]\r\n\r\nI have just received your note. It is the greatest pleasure to me to\r\nwrite or talk Geology with you...\r\n\r\nI think I have thought over the whole case without prejudice, and\r\nremain firmly convinced they [the parallel roads] are marine beaches. My\r\nprincipal reason for doing so is what I have urged in my paper (517/15.\r\n\"Observations on the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, and of other parts of\r\nLochaber in Scotland, with an attempt to prove that they are of Marine\r\nOrigin.\" \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" 1839, page 39.), the buttress-like\r\naccumulations of stratified shingle on sides of valley, especially those\r\njust below the lowest shelf in Spean Valley.\r\n\r\n2nd. I can hardly conceive the extension of the glaciers in front of the\r\nvalley of Kilfinnin, where I found a new road--where the sides of Great\r\nGlen are not very lofty.\r\n\r\n3rd. The flat watersheds which I describe in places where there are\r\nno roads, as well as those connected with \"roads.\" These remain\r\nunexplained.\r\n\r\nI might continue to add many other such reasons, all of which, however,\r\nI daresay would appear trifling to any one who had not visited the\r\ndistrict. With respect to equable elevation, it cannot be a valid\r\nobjection to any one who thinks of Scandinavia or the Pampas. With\r\nrespect to the glacier theory, the greatest objection appears to me the\r\nfollowing, though possibly not a sound one. The water has beyond doubt\r\nremained very long at the levels of each shelf--this is unequivocally\r\nshown by the depth of the notch or beach formed in many places in\r\nthe hard mica-slate, and the large accumulations or buttresses of\r\nwell-rounded pebbles at certain spots on the level of old beaches. (The\r\ntime must have been immense, if formed by lakes without tides.) During\r\nthe existence of the lakes their drainage must have been at the head of\r\nthe valleys, and has given the flat appearance of the watersheds. All\r\nthis is very clear for four of the shelves (viz., upper and lower in\r\nGlen Roy, the 800-foot one in Glen Spean, and the one in Kilfinnin), and\r\nexplains the coincidence of \"roads\" with the watersheds more simply than\r\nmy view, and as simply as the common lake theory. But how was the Glen\r\nRoy lake drained when the water stood at level of the middle \"road\"? It\r\nmust (for there is no other exit whatever) have been drained over the\r\nglacier. Now this shelf is full as narrow in a vertical line and\r\nas deeply worn horizontally into the mountain side and with a large\r\naccumulation of shingle (I can give cases) as the other shelves. We\r\nmust, therefore, on the glacier theory, suppose that the surface of\r\nthe ice remained at exactly the same level, not being worn down by the\r\nrunning water, or the glacier moved by its own movement during the very\r\nlong period absolutely necessary for a quiet lake to form such a beach\r\nas this shelf presents in its whole course. I do not know whether I have\r\nexplained myself clearly. I should like to know what you think of this\r\ndifficulty. I shall much like to talk over the Jura case with you. I am\r\ntired, so goodbye.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 518. TO L. HORNER. Down [1846].\r\n\r\n(518/1. It was agreed at the British Association meeting held at\r\nSouthampton in 1846 \"That application be made to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment to direct that during the progress of the Ordnance\r\nTrigonometrical Surveys in the North of Scotland, the so-called Parallel\r\nRoads of Glen Roy and the adjoining country be accurately surveyed, with\r\nthe view of determining whether they are truly parallel and horizontal,\r\nthe intervening distances, and their elevations above the present\r\nsea-level\" (\"British Association Report,\" 1846, page xix). The survey\r\nwas undertaken by the Government Ordnance Survey Office under Col. Sir\r\nHenry James, who published the results in 1874 (\"Notes on the Parallel\r\nRoads of Glen Roy\"); the map on which the details are given is sheet 63\r\n(one-inch scale).)\r\n\r\nIn following your suggestion in drawing out something about Glen Roy for\r\nthe Geological Committee, I have been completely puzzled how to do it.\r\nI have written down what I should say if I had to meet the head of the\r\nSurvey and wished to persuade him to undertake the task; but as I have\r\nwritten it, it is too long, ill expressed, seems as if it came from\r\nnobody and was going to nobody, and therefore I send it to you in\r\ndespair, and beg you to turn the subject in your mind. I feel a\r\nconviction if it goes through the Geological part of Ordnance Survey it\r\nwill be swamped, and as it is a case for mere accurate measurements it\r\nmight, I think without offence, go to the head of the real Surveyors.\r\n\r\nIf Agassiz or Buckland are on the Committee they will sneer at the whole\r\nthing and declare the beaches are those of a glacier-lake, than which I\r\nam sure I could convince you that there never was a more futile theory.\r\n\r\nI look forward to Southampton (518/2. The British Association meeting\r\n(1846).) with much interest, and hope to hear to-morrow that the\r\nlodgings are secured to us. You cannot think how thoroughly I enjoyed\r\nour geological talks, and the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Horner and\r\nyourself here. (518/3. This letter is published in the privately printed\r\n\"Memoir of Leonard Horner,\" II., page 103.)\r\n\r\n[Here follows Darwin's Memorandum.]\r\n\r\nThe Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, in Scotland, have been the object of\r\nrepeated examination, but they have never hitherto been levelled with\r\nsufficient accuracy. Sir T. Lauder Dick (518/4. \"On the Parallel Roads\r\nof Lochaber\" (with map and plates), by Sir Thomas Lauder Dick, \"Trans.\r\nR. Soc. Edinb.\" Volume IX., page 1, 1823.) procured the assistance of an\r\nengineer for this purpose, but owing to the want of a true ground-plan\r\nit was impossible to ascertain their exact curvature, which, as far as\r\ncould be estimated, appeared equal to that of the surface of the sea.\r\nConsidering how very rarely the sea has left narrow and well-defined\r\nmarks of its action at any considerable height on the land, and more\r\nespecially considering the remarkable observations by M. Bravais (518/5.\r\n\"On the Lines of Ancient Level of the Sea in Finmark,\" by M. A. Bravais,\r\ntranslated from \"Voyages de la Commission Scientifique du Nord, etc.\";\r\n\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume I., page 534, 1845.) on the ancient\r\nsea-beaches of Scandinavia, showing the they are not strictly parallel\r\nto each other, and that the movement has been greater nearer the\r\nmountains than on the coast, it appears highly desirable that the roads\r\nof Glen Roy should be examined with the utmost care during the execution\r\nof the Ordnance Survey of Scotland. The best instruments and the most\r\naccurate measurements being necessary for this end almost precludes the\r\nhope of its being ever undertaken by private individuals; but by the\r\nmeans at the disposal of the Ordnance, measurements would be easily made\r\neven more accurate than those of M. Bravais. It would be desirable to\r\ntake two lines of the greatest possible length in the district, and at\r\nnearly right angles to each other, and to level from the beach at one\r\nextremity to that at the other, so that it might be ascertained whether\r\nthe curvature does exactly correspond with that of the globe, or, if\r\nnot, what is the direction of the line of greatest elevation. Much\r\nattention would be requisite in fixing on either the upper or lower edge\r\nof the ancient beaches as the standard of measurement, and in rendering\r\nthis line conspicuous. The heights of the three roads, one above\r\nthe other and above the level of the sea, ought to be accurately\r\nascertained. Mr. Darwin observed one short beach-line north of Glen Roy,\r\nand he has indicated, on the authority of Sir David Brewster, others\r\nin the valley of the Spey. If these could be accurately connected, by\r\ncareful measurements of their absolute heights or by levelling, with\r\nthose of Glen Roy, it would make a most valuable addition to our\r\nknowledge on this subject. Although the observations here specified\r\nwould probably be laborious, yet, considering how rarely such evidence\r\nis afforded in any quarter of the world, it cannot be doubted that one\r\nof the most important problems in Geology--namely, the exact manner in\r\nwhich the crust of the earth rises in mass--would be much elucidated,\r\nand a great service done to geological science.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 519. R. CHAMBERS TO D. MILNE-HOME. St. Andrews, September 7th,\r\n1847.\r\n\r\nI have had a letter to-day from Mr. Charles Darwin, beseeching me to\r\nobtain for him a copy of your paper on Glen Roy. (519/1. No doubt Mr.\r\nMilne's paper \"On the Parallel Roads of Lochaber,\" \"Trans. R. Soc.\r\nEdinb.\" Volume XVI., page 395, 1849. [Read March 1st and April 5th,\r\n1847.]) I am sure you will have pleasure in sending him one; his\r\naddress is \"Down, Farnborough, Kent.\" I have again read over your paper\r\ncarefully, and feel assured that the careful collection and statement of\r\nfacts which are found in it must redound to your credit with all candid\r\npersons. The suspicions, however, which I obtained some time ago as to\r\nland-straits and heights of country being connected with sea-margins and\r\ntheir ordinary memorials still possesses me, and I am looking forward to\r\nsome means of further testing the Glen Roy mystery. If my suspicion turn\r\nout true, I shall at once be regretful on your account, and shall feel\r\nit as a great check and admonition to myself not to be too confident\r\nabout anything in science till it has been proved over and over again.\r\nThe ground hereabouts is now getting clear of the crops; perhaps when I\r\nam in town a few days hence we may be able to make some appointment for\r\nan examination of the beaches of the district, my list of which has been\r\ngreatly enlarged during the last two months.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 520. TO R. CHAMBERS. September 11th, 1847.\r\n\r\nI hope you will read the first part of my paper before you go [to Glen\r\nRoy], and attend to the manner in which the lines end in Glen Collarig.\r\nI wish Mr. Milne had read it more carefully. He misunderstands me in\r\nseveral respects, but [I] suppose it is my own fault, for my paper is\r\nmost tediously written. Mr. Milne fights me very pleasantly, and I plead\r\nguilty to his rebuke about \"demonstration.\" (520/1. See Letter 521,\r\nnote.) I do not know what you think; but Mr. Milne will think me as\r\nobstinate as a pig when I say that I think any barriers of detritus at\r\nthe mouth of Glen Roy, Collarig and Glaster more utterly impossible\r\nthan words can express. I abide by all that I have written on that head.\r\nConceive such a mass of detritus having been removed, without great\r\nprojections being left on each side, in the very close proximity to\r\nevery little delta preserved on the lines of the shelves, even on the\r\nshelf 4, which now crosses with uniform breadth the spot where the\r\nbarrier stood, with the shelves dying gradually out, etc. To my mind it\r\nis monstrous. Oddly enough, Mr. Milne's description of the mouth of Loch\r\nTreig (I do not believe that valley has been well examined in its upper\r\nend) leaves hardly a doubt that a glacier descended from it, and, if the\r\nroads were formed by a lake of any kind, I believe it must have been\r\nan ice-lake. I have given in detail to Lyell my several reasons for\r\nnot thinking ice-lakes probable (520/2. Mr. Darwin gives some arguments\r\nagainst the glacier theory in the letter (517) to Sir Charles Lyell;\r\nbut the letter alluded to is no doubt the one written to Lyell on\r\n\"Wednesday, 8th\" (Letter 522), in which the reasons are fully stated.);\r\nbut to my mind they are incomparably more probable than detritus of\r\nrock-barriers. Have you ever attended to glacier action? After having\r\nseen N. Wales, I can no more doubt the former existence of gigantic\r\nglaciers than I can the sun in the heaven. I could distinguish in N.\r\nWales to a certain extent icebergs from glacier action (Lyell has shown\r\nthat icebergs at the present day score rocks), and I suspect that in\r\nLochaber the two actions are united, and that the scored rock on the\r\nwatersheds, when tideways, were rubbed and bumped by half-stranded\r\nicebergs. You will, no doubt, attend to Glen Glaster. Mr. Milne, I\r\nthink, does not mention whether shelf 4 enters it, which I should like\r\nto know, and especially he does not state whether rocks worn on their\r\nupper faces are found on the whole 212 [feet] vertical course of this\r\nGlen down to near L. Loggan, or whether only in the upper part; nor does\r\nhe state whether these rocks are scored, or polished, or moutonnees, or\r\nwhether there are any \"perched\" boulders there or elsewhere. I suspect\r\nit would be difficult to distinguish between a river-bed and tidal\r\nchannel. Mr. Milne's description of the Pass of Mukkul, expanding to a\r\nwidth of several hundred yards 21 feet deep in the shoalest part, and\r\nwith a worn islet in the middle, sounds to me much more like a tidal\r\nchannel than a river-bed. There must have been, on the latter view,\r\nplenty of fresh water in those days. With respect to the coincidence\r\nof the shelves with the now watersheds, Mr. Milne only gives half of my\r\nexplanation. Please read page 65 of my paper. (520/3. \"Observations\r\non the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, and of other Parts of Lochaber in\r\nScotland, with an Attempt to Prove that they are of Marine Origin.\"\r\n\"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" 1839, page 39. [Read February 7th, 1839.]) I\r\nallude only to the head of Glen Roy and Kilfinnin as silted up. I did\r\nnot know Mukkul Pass; and Glen Roy was so much covered up that I did not\r\nsearch it well, as I was not able to walk very well. It has been an old\r\nconjectural belief of mine that a rising surface becomes stationary,\r\nnot suddenly, but by the movement becoming very slow. Now, this would\r\ngreatly aid the tidal currents cutting down the passes between the\r\nmountains just before, and to the level of, the stationary periods.\r\nThe currents in the fiords in T. del Fuego in a narrow crooked part are\r\noften most violent; in other parts they seem to silt up.\r\n\r\nShall you do any levelling? I believe all the levelling has been\r\n[done] in Glen Roy, nearly parallel to the Great Glen of Scotland. For\r\ninequalities of elevation, the valley of the Spean, at right angles to\r\nthe apparent axes of elevation, would be the one to examine. If you go\r\nto the head of Glen Roy, attend to the apparent shelf above the highest\r\none in Glen Roy, lying on the south side of Loch Spey, and therefore\r\nbeyond the watershed of Glen Roy. It would be a crucial case. I was\r\ntoo unwell on that day to examine it carefully, and I had no levelling\r\ninstruments. Do these fragments coincide in level with Glen Gluoy shelf?\r\n\r\nMacCulloch talks of one in Glen Turret above the shelf. I could not see\r\nit. These would be important discoveries. But I will write no more, and\r\npray your forgiveness for this long, ill-written outpouring. I am very\r\nglad you keep to your subject of the terraces. I have lately observed\r\nthat you have one great authority (C. Prevost), [not] that authority\r\nsignifies a [farthing?] on your side respecting your heretical and\r\ndamnable doctrine of the ocean falling. You see I am orthodox to the\r\nburning pitch.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 521. TO D. MILNE-HOME. Down, [September] 20th, [1847].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged by your note. I returned from London on Saturday, and\r\nI found then your memoir (521/1. \"On the Parallel Roads of Lochaber,\r\nwith Remarks on the Change of Relative Levels of Sea and Land in\r\nScotland, and on the Detrital Deposits in that Country,\" \"Trans. R.\r\nSoc. Edinb.\" Volume XVI., page 395, 1849. [Read March 1st and April 5th,\r\n1847.]), which I had not then received, owing to the porter having been\r\nout when I last sent to the Geological Society. I have read your paper\r\nwith the greatest interest, and have been much struck with the novelty\r\nand importance of many of your facts. I beg to thank you for the\r\ncourteous manner in which you combat me, and I plead quite guilty to\r\nyour rebuke about demonstration. (521/2. Mr. Milne quotes a passage from\r\nMr. Darwin's paper (\"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" 1839, page 56), in which the\r\nlatter speaks of the marine origin of the parallel roads of Lochaber as\r\nappearing to him as having been demonstrated. Mr. Milne adds: \"I regret\r\nthat Mr. Darwin should have expressed himself in these very decided and\r\nconfident terms, especially as his survey was incomplete; for I venture\r\nto think that it can be satisfactorily established that the parallel\r\nroads of Lochaber were formed by fresh-water lakes\" (Milne, loc. cit.,\r\npage 400).) You have misunderstood my paper on a few points, but I do\r\nnot doubt that is owing to its being badly and tediously written. You\r\nwill, I fear, think me very obstinate when I say that I am not in the\r\nleast convinced about the barriers (521/3. Mr. Milne believed that the\r\nlower parts of the valleys were filled with detritus, which constituted\r\nbarriers and thus dammed up the waters into lakes.): they remain to me\r\nas improbable as ever. But the oddest result of your paper on me (and I\r\nassure you, as far as I know myself, it is not perversity) is that I\r\nam very much staggered in favour of the ice-lake theory of Agassiz and\r\nBuckland (521/4. Agassiz and Buckland believed that the lakes which\r\nformed the \"roads\" were confined by glaciers or moraines. See \"The\r\nGlacial Theory and its Recent Progress,\" by Louis Agassiz, \"Edinb. New\r\nPhil. Journ.\" Volume XXXIII., page 217, 1842 (with map).): until I read\r\nyour important discovery of the outlet in Glen Glaster I never thought\r\nthis theory at all tenable. (521/5. Mr. Milne discovered that the middle\r\nshelf of Glen Roy, which Mr. Darwin stated was \"not on a level with\r\nany watershed\" (Darwin, loc. cit., page 43), exactly coincided with a\r\nwatershed at the head of Glen Glaster (Milne, loc. cit., page 398).) Now\r\nit appears to me that a very good case can be made in its favour. I am\r\nnot, however, as yet a believer in the ice-lake theory, but I tremble\r\nfor the result. I have had a good deal of talk with Mr. Lyell on\r\nthe subject, and from his advice I am going to send a letter to the\r\n\"Scotsman,\" in which I give briefly my present impression (though there\r\nis not space to argue with you on such points as I think I could argue),\r\nand indicate what points strike me as requiring further investigation\r\nwith respect, chiefly, to the ice-lake theory, so that you will not care\r\nabout it...\r\n\r\nP.S.--Some facts mentioned in my \"Geology of S. America,\" page 24\r\n(521/6. The creeks which penetrate the western shores of Tierra del\r\nFuego are described as \"almost invariably much shallower close to\r\nthe open sea at their mouths than inland...This shoalness of the\r\nsea-channels near their entrances probably results from the quantity of\r\nsediment formed by the wear and tear of the outer rocks exposed to\r\nthe full force of the open sea. I have no doubt that many lakes--for\r\ninstance, in Scotland--which are very deep within, and are separated\r\nfrom the sea apparently only by a tract of detritus, were originally\r\nsea-channels, with banks of this nature near their mouths, which have\r\nsince been upheaved\" (\"Geol. Obs. S. America,\" page 24, footnote.), with\r\nregard to the shoaling of the deep fiords of T. del Fuego near their\r\nmouths, and which I have remarked would tend, with a little elevation,\r\nto convert such fiords into lakes with a great mound-like barrier of\r\ndetritus at their mouths, might, possibly, have been of use to you with\r\nregard to the lakes of Glen Roy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 522. TO C. LYELL. Down, Wednesday, 8th.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your paper. (522/1. \"On the Ancient Glaciers of\r\nForfarshire.\" \"Proc. Geol. Soc.\" Volume III., page 337, 1840.) I do\r\nadmire your zeal on a subject on which you are not immediately at work.\r\nI will give my opinion as briefly as I can, and I have endeavoured my\r\nbest to be honest. Poor Mrs. Lyell will have, I foresee, a long letter\r\nto read aloud, but I will try to write better than usual. Imprimis, it\r\nis provoking that Mr. Milne (522/2. \"On the Parallel Roads of Lochaber,\r\netc.\" \"Trans. R. Soc. Edinb.\" Volume XVI., page 395, 1849. [Read March\r\n1st and April 5th, 1847.]) has read my paper (522/3. \"Observations on\r\nthe Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, etc.\" \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" 1839, page\r\n39. [Read February 7th, 1839.].) with little attention, for he makes\r\nme say several things which I do not believe--as, that the water sunk\r\nsuddenly! (page 10), that the Valley of Glen Roy, page 13, and Spean was\r\nfilled up with detritus to level of the lower shelf, against which there\r\nis, I conceive, good evidence, etc., but I suppose it is the consequence\r\nof my paper being most tediously written. He gives me a just snub for\r\ntalking of demonstration, and he fights me in a very pleasant manner.\r\nNow for business. I utterly disbelieve in the barriers (522/4. See note,\r\nLetter 521.) for his lakes, and think he has left that point exactly\r\nwhere it was in the time of MacCulloch (522/5. \"On the Parallel Roads of\r\nGlen Roy.\" \"Geol. Trans.\" Volume IV., page 314, 1817 (with several maps\r\nand sections).) and Dick. (522/6. \"On the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.\"\r\n\"Trans. R. Soc. Edinb.\" Volume IX., page 1, 1823.) Indeed, in showing\r\nthat there is a passage at Glen Glaster at the level of the intermediate\r\nshelf, he makes the difficulty to my mind greater. (522/7. See Letter\r\n521, note.) When I think of the gradual manner in which the two upper\r\nterraces die out at Glen Collarig and at the mouth of Glen Roy, the\r\nsmooth rounded form of the hills there, and the lower shelf retaining\r\nits usual width where the immense barrier stood, I can deliberately\r\nrepeat \"that more convincing proofs of the non-existence of the\r\nimaginary Loch Roy could scarcely have been invented with full play\r\ngiven to the imagination,\" etc.: but I do not adhere to this remark\r\nwith such strength when applied to the glacier-lake theory. Oddly, I was\r\nnever at all staggered by this theory until now, having read Mr. Milne's\r\nargument against it. I now can hardly doubt that a great glacier did\r\nemerge from Loch Treig, and this by the ice itself (not moraine) might\r\nhave blocked up the three outlets from Glen Roy. I do not, however, yet\r\nbelieve in the glacier theory, for reasons which I will presently give.\r\n\r\nThere are three chief hostile considerations in Mr. Milne's paper.\r\nFirst, the Glen [shelf?], not coinciding in height with the upper one\r\n[outlet?], from observations giving 12 feet, 15 feet, 29 feet, 23 feet:\r\nif the latter are correct the terrace must be quite independent, and the\r\ncase is hostile; but Mr. Milne shows that there is one in Glen Roy 14\r\nfeet below the upper one, and a second one again (which I observed)\r\nbeneath this, and then we come to the proper second shelf. Hence there\r\nis no great improbability in an independent shelf having been found in\r\nGlen Gluoy.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to Mr. Milne's second class of facts (obvious to every\r\none), namely the non-extension of the three shelves beyond Glen Roy; but\r\nI abide by what I have written on that point, and repeat that if in Glen\r\nRoy, where circumstances have been so favourable for the preservation\r\nor formation of the terraces, a terrace could be formed quite plain for\r\nthree-quarters of a mile with hardly a trace elsewhere, we cannot argue,\r\nfrom the non-existence of shelves, that water did not stand at the same\r\nlevels in other valleys. Feeling absolutely convinced that there was no\r\nbarrier of detritus at the mouth of Glen Roy, and pretty well convinced\r\nthat there was none of ice, the manner in which the terraces die out\r\nwhen entering Glen Spean, which must have been a tideway, shows on\r\nwhat small circumstances the formation of these shelves depended. With\r\nrespect to the non-existence of shelves in other parts of Scotland, Mr.\r\nMilne shows that many others do exist, and their heights above the sea\r\nhave not yet been carefully measured, nor have even those of Glen\r\nRoy, which I suspect are all 100 feet too high. Moreover, according to\r\nBravais (522/8. \"On the Lines of Ancient Level of the Sea in Finmark.\"\r\nBy A. Bravais, Member of the Scientific Commission of the North. \"Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc.\" Volume I., page 534, 1845 (a translation).), we\r\nmust not feel sure that either the absolute height or the intermediate\r\nheights between the terraces would be at all the same at distant points.\r\nIn levelling the terraces in Lochaber, all, I believe, have been taken\r\nin Glen Roy, nearly N. and S. There should be levels taken at right\r\nangles to this line and to the Great Glen of Scotland or chief line of\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the nature of the outlets from the supposed lakes. This appears\r\nto me the best and newest part of the paper. If Sir James Clark would\r\nlike to attend to any particular points, direct his attention to this:\r\nespecially to follow Glen Glaster from Glen Roy to L. Laggan. Mr. Milne\r\ndescribes this as an old and great river-course with a fall of 212 feet.\r\nHe states that the rocks are smooth on upper face and rough on lower,\r\nbut he does not mention whether this character prevails throughout the\r\nwhole 212 vertical feet--a most important consideration; nor does he\r\nstate whether these rocks are polished or scratched, as might have\r\nhappened even to a considerable depth beneath the water (Mem. great\r\nicebergs in narrow fiords of T. del Fuego (522/9. In the \"Voyage of the\r\n'Beagle'\" a description is given of the falling of great masses of ice\r\nfrom the icy cliffs of the glaciers with a crash that \"reverberates\r\nlike the broadside of a man-of-war, through the lonely channels\" which\r\nintersect the coast-line of Tierra del Fuego. Loc. cit., page 246.))\r\nby the action of icebergs, for that icebergs transported boulders on to\r\nterraces, I have no doubt. Mr. Milne's description of the outlets of\r\nhis lake sound to me more like tidal channels, nor does he give any\r\narguments how such are to be distinguished from old river-courses.\r\nI cannot believe in the body of fresh water which must, on the lake\r\ntheory, have flowed out of them. At the Pass of Mukkul he states that\r\nthe outlet is 70 feet wide and the rocky bottom 21 feet below the level\r\nof the shelf, and that the gorge expands to the eastwards into a broad\r\nchannel of several hundred yards in width, divided in the middle by what\r\nhas formerly been a rocky islet, against which the waters of this large\r\nriver had chafed in issuing from the pass. We know the size of the river\r\nat the present day which would flow out through this pass, and it seems\r\nto me (and in the other given cases) to be as inadequate; the whole\r\nseems to me far easier explained by a tideway than by a formerly more\r\nhumid climate.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the very remarkable coincidence between the shelves and\r\nthe outlets (rendered more remarkable by Mr. Milne's discovery of the\r\noutlet to the intermediate shelf at Glen Glaster (522/10. See Letter\r\n521, note.)), Mr. Milne gives only half of my explanation; he alludes\r\nto (and disputes) the smoothing and silting-up action, which I still\r\nbelieve in. I state: If we consider what must take place during\r\nthe gradual rise of a group of islands, we shall have the currents\r\nendeavouring to cut down and deepen some shallow parts in the channels\r\nas they are successively brought near the surface, but tending from the\r\nopposition of tides to choke up others with littoral deposits. During\r\na long interval of rest, from the length of time allowed to the above\r\nprocesses, the tendency would often prove effective, both in forming, by\r\naccumulation of matter, isthmuses, and in keeping open channels. Hence\r\nsuch isthmuses and channels just kept open would oftener be formed at\r\nthe level which the waters held at the interval of rest, than at any\r\nother (page 65). I look at the Pass of Mukkul (21 feet deep, Milne) as a\r\nchannel just kept open, and the head of Glen Roy (where there is a\r\ngreat bay silted up) and of Kilfinnin (at both which places there are\r\nlevel-topped mounds of detritus above the level of the terraces) as\r\ninstances of channels filled up at the stationary levels. I have long\r\nthought it a probable conjecture that when a rising surface becomes\r\nstationary it becomes so, not at once, but by the movements first\r\nbecoming very slow; this would greatly favour the cutting down many gaps\r\nin the mountains to the level of the stationary periods.\r\n\r\nGLACIER THEORY.\r\n\r\nIf a glacialist admitted that the sea, before the formation of the\r\nterraces, covered the country (which would account for land-straits\r\nabove level of terraces), and that the land gradually emerged, and if\r\nhe supposed his lakes were banked by ice alone, he would make out, in my\r\nopinion, the best case against the marine origin of the terraces. From\r\nthe scattered boulders and till, you and I must look at it as certain\r\nthat the sea did cover the whole country, and I abide quite by my\r\narguments from the buttresses, etc., that water of some kind receded\r\nslowly from the valleys of Lochaber (I presume Mr. Milne admits this).\r\nNow, I do not believe in the ice-lake theory, from the following weak\r\nbut accumulating reasons: because, 1st, the receding water must have\r\nbeen that of a lake in Glen Spean, and of the sea in the other valleys\r\nof Scotland, where I saw similar buttresses at many levels; 2nd, because\r\nthe outlets of the supposed lakes as already stated seem, from Mr.\r\nMilne's statements, too much worn and too large; 3rd, when the lake\r\nstood at the three-quarters of a mile shelf the water from it must have\r\nflowed over ice itself for a very long time, and kept at the same exact\r\nlevel: certainly this shelf required a long time for its formation; 4th,\r\nI cannot believe a glacier would have blocked up the short, very wide\r\nvalley of Kilfinnin, the Great Glen of Scotland also being very low\r\nthere; 5th, the country at some places where Mr. Milne has described\r\nterraces is not mountainous, and the number of ice-lakes appears to me\r\nvery improbable; 6th, I do not believe any lake could scoop the rocks\r\nso much as they are at the entrance to Loch Treig or cut them off at the\r\nhead of Upper Glen Roy; 7th, the very gradual dying away of the terraces\r\nat the mouth of Glen Roy does not look like a barrier of any kind; 8th,\r\nI should have expected great terminal moraines across the mouth of Glen\r\nRoy, Glen Collarig, and Glaster, at least at the bottom of the valleys.\r\nSuch, I feel pretty sure, do not exist.\r\n\r\nI fear I must have wearied you with the length of this letter, which\r\nI have not had time to arrange properly. I could argue at great length\r\nagainst Mr. Milne's theory of barriers of detritus, though I could help\r\nhim in one way--viz., by the soundings which occur at the entrances of\r\nthe deepest fiords in T. del Fuego. I do not think he gives the smallest\r\nsatisfaction with respect to the successive and comparatively sudden\r\nbreakage of his many lakes.\r\n\r\nWell, I enjoyed my trip to Glen Roy very much, but it was time thrown\r\naway. I heartily wish you would go there; it should be some one who\r\nknows glacier and iceberg action, and sea action well. I wish the Queen\r\nwould command you. I had intended being in London to-morrow, but one of\r\nmy principal plagues will, I believe, stop me; if I do I will assuredly\r\ncall on you. I have not yet read Mr. Milne on Elevation (522/11. \"On\r\na Remarkable Oscillation of the Sea, observed at Various Places on the\r\nCoasts of Great Britain in the First Week of July, 1843.\" \"Trans. R.\r\nSoc. Edinb.\" Volume XV., page 609, 1844.), so will keep his paper for a\r\nday or two.\r\n\r\nP.S.--As you cannot want this letter, I wish you would return it to me,\r\nas it will serve as a memorandum for me. Possibly I shall write to Mr.\r\nChambers, though I do not know whether he will care about what I think\r\non the subject. This letter is too long and ill-written for Sir J.\r\nClark.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 523. TO LADY LYELL. [October 4th, 1847.]\r\n\r\nI enclose a letter from Chambers, which has pleased me very much (which\r\nplease return), but I cannot feel quite so sure as he does. If the\r\nLochaber and Tweed roads really turn out exactly on a level, the sea\r\ntheory is proved. What a magnificent proof of equality of elevation,\r\nwhich does not surprise me much; but I fear I see cause of doubt, for\r\nas far as I remember there are numerous terraces, near Galashiels, with\r\nsmall intervals of height, so that the coincidence of height might be\r\ncooked. Chambers does not seem aware of one very striking coincidence,\r\nviz., that I made by careful measurement my Kilfinnin terrace 1202 feet\r\nabove sea, and now Glen Gluoy is 1203 feet, according to the recent more\r\ncareful measurements. Even Agassiz (523/1. \"On the Glacial Theory,\" by\r\nLouis Agassiz, \"Edinb. New Phil. Journ.\" Volume XXXIII., page 217, 1842.\r\nThe parallel terraces are dealt with by Agassiz, pages 236 et seq.)\r\nwould be puzzled to block up Glen Gluoy and Kilfinnin by the same\r\nglacier, and then, moreover, the lake would have two outlets. With\r\nrespect to the middle terrace of Glen Roy--seen by Chambers in the Spean\r\n(figured by Agassiz, and seen by myself but not noticed, as I thought\r\nit might have been a sheep track)--it might yet have been formed on the\r\nice-lake theory by two independent glaciers going across the Spean, but\r\nit is very improbable that two such immense ones should not have been\r\nunited into one. Chambers, unfortunately, does not seem to have visited\r\nthe head of the Spey, and I have written to propose joining funds and\r\nsending some young surveyor there. If my letter is published in the\r\n\"Scotsman,\" how Buckland (523/2. Professor Buckland may be described as\r\njoint author, with Agassiz, of the Glacier theory.), as I have foreseen,\r\nwill crow over me: he will tell me he always knew that I was wrong, but\r\nnow I shall have rather ridiculously to say, \"but I am all right again.\"\r\n\r\nI have been a good deal interested in Miller (523/3. Hugh Miller's\r\n\"First Impressions of England and its People,\" London, 1847.), but I\r\nfind it not quick reading, and Emma has hardly begun it yet. I rather\r\nwish the scenic descriptions were shorter, and that there was a little\r\nless geologic eloquence.\r\n\r\nLyell's picture now hangs over my chimneypiece, and uncommonly glad I am\r\nto have it, and thank you for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 524. TO C. LYELL. Down, September 6th [1861].\r\n\r\nI think the enclosed is worth your reading. I am smashed to atoms about\r\nGlen Roy. My paper was one long gigantic blunder from beginning to end.\r\nEheu! Eheu! (524/1. See \"Life and Letters,\" I., pages 68, 69, also pages\r\n290, 291.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 525. TO C. LYELL. Down, September 22nd [1861].\r\n\r\nI have read Mr. Jamieson's last letter, like the former ones, with very\r\ngreat interest. (525/1. Mr. Jamieson visited Glen Roy in August 1861 and\r\nin July 1862. His paper \"On the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, and their\r\nPlace in the History of the Glacial Period,\" was published in the\r\n\"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\" in 1863, Volume XIX.,\r\npage 235. His latest contribution to this subject was published in the\r\n\"Quarterly Journal,\" Volume XLVIII., page 5, 1892.) What a problem you\r\nhave in hand! It beats manufacturing new species all to bits. It would\r\nbe a great personal consolation to me if Mr. J. can admit the sloping\r\nSpean terrace to be marine, and would remove one of my greatest\r\ndifficulties--viz. the vast contrast of Welsh and Lochaber valleys. But\r\nthen, as far as I dare trust my observations, the sloping terraces ran\r\nfar up the Roy valley, so as to reach not far below the lower shelf. If\r\nthe sloping fringes are marine and the shelves lacustrine, all I can\r\nsay is that nature has laid a shameful trap to catch an unwary wretch. I\r\nsuppose that I have underrated the power of lakes in producing pebbles;\r\nthis, I think, ought to be well looked to. I was much struck in Wales\r\non carefully comparing the glacial scratches under a lake (formed by a\r\nmoraine and which must have existed since the Glacial epoch) and above\r\nwater, and I could perceive NO difference. I believe I saw many such\r\nbeds of good pebbles on level of lower shelf, which at the time I could\r\nnot believe could have been found on shores of lake. The land-straits\r\nand little cliffs above them, to which I referred, were quite above the\r\nhighest shelf; they may be of much more ancient date than the shelves.\r\nSome terrace-like fringes at head of the Spey strike me as very\r\nsuspicious. Mr. J. refers to absence of pebbles at considerable heights:\r\nhe must remember that every storm, every deer, every hare which runs\r\ntends to roll pebbles down hill, and not one ever goes up again. I\r\nmay mention that I particularly alluded to this on S. Ventanao (525/2.\r\n\"Geolog. Obs. on South America,\" page 79. \"On the flanks of the\r\nmountains, at a height of 300 or 400 feet above the plain, there were\r\na few small patches of conglomerate and breccia, firmly cemented by\r\nferruginous matter to the abrupt and battered face of the quartz--traces\r\nbeing thus exhibited of ancient sea-action.\") in N. Patagonia, a great\r\nisolated rugged quartz-mountain 3,000 feet high, and I could find not\r\none pebble except on one very small spot, where a ferruginous spring had\r\nfirmly cemented a few to the face of mountain. If the Lochaber lakes had\r\nbeen formed by an ice-period posterior to the (marine?) sloping terraces\r\nin the Spean, would not Mr. J. have noticed gigantic moraines across the\r\nvalley opposite the opening of Lake Treig? I go so far as not to like\r\nmaking the elevation of the land in Wales and Scotland considerably\r\ndifferent with respect to the ice-period, and still more do I dislike\r\nit with respect to E. and W. Scotland. But I may be prejudiced by having\r\nbeen so long accustomed to the plains of Patagonia. But the equality of\r\nlevel (barring denudation) of even the Secondary formations in Britain,\r\nafter so many ups and downs, always impresses my mind, that, except when\r\nthe crust-cracks and mountains are formed, movements of elevation and\r\nsubsidence are generally very equable.\r\n\r\nBut it is folly my scribbling thus. You have a grand problem, and heaven\r\nhelp you and Mr. Jamieson through it. It is out of my line nowadays, and\r\nabove and beyond me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 526. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 28th [1861].\r\n\r\nIt is, I believe, true that Glen Roy shelves (I remember your Indian\r\nletter) were formed by glacial lakes. I persuaded Mr. Jamieson, an\r\nexcellent observer, to go and observe them; and this is his result.\r\nThere are some great difficulties to be explained, but I presume this\r\nwill ultimately be proved the truth...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 527. TO C. LYELL. Down, October 1st [1861].\r\n\r\nThank you for the most interesting correspondence. What a wonderful case\r\nthat of Bedford. (527/1. No doubt this refers to the discovery of flint\r\nimplements in the Valley of the Ouse, near Bedford, in 1861 (see Lyell's\r\n\"Antiquity of Man,\" pages 163 et seq., 1863.) I thought the problem\r\nsufficiently perplexing before, but now it beats anything I ever heard\r\nof. Far from being able to give any hypothesis for any part, I cannot\r\nget the facts into my mind. What a capital observer and reasoner Mr.\r\nJamieson is. The only way that I can reconcile my memory of Lochaber\r\nwith the state of the Welsh valleys is by imagining a great barrier,\r\nformed by a terminal moraine, at the mouth of the Spean, which the\r\nriver had to cut slowly through, as it drained the lowest lake after\r\nthe Glacial period. This would, I can suppose, account for the sloping\r\nterraces along the Spean. I further presume that sharp transverse\r\nmoraines would not be formed under the waters of the lake, where the\r\nglacier came out of L. Treig and abutted against the opposite side of\r\nthe valley. A nice mess I made of Glen Roy! I have no spare copy of\r\nmy Welsh paper (527/2. \"Notes on the Effects produced by the Ancient\r\nGlaciers of Caernarvonshire, and on the Boulders transported by Floating\r\nIce,\" \"Edinb. New Phil. Journ.\" Volume XXXIII., page 352, 1842.); it\r\nwould do you no good to lend it. I suppose I thought that there must\r\nhave been floating ice on Moel Tryfan. I think it cannot be disputed\r\nthat the last event in N. Wales was land-glaciers. I could not decide\r\nwhere the action of land-glaciers ceased and marine glacial action\r\ncommenced at the mouths of the valleys.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful case the Bedford case. Does not the N. American view of\r\nwarmer or more equable period, after great Glacial period, become much\r\nmore probable in Europe?\r\n\r\nBut I am very poorly to-day, and very stupid, and hate everybody and\r\neverything. One lives only to make blunders. I am going to write a\r\nlittle book for Murray on Orchids (527/3. \"On the Various Contrivances\r\nby which Orchids are Fertilised by Insects,\" London, 1862.), and to-day\r\nI hate them worse than everything. So farewell, in a sweet frame of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 528. TO C. LYELL. Down, October 14th [1861].\r\n\r\nI return Jamieson's capital letter. I have no comments, except to say\r\nthat he has removed all my difficulties, and that now and for evermore I\r\ngive up and abominate Glen Roy and all its belongings. It certainly is\r\na splendid case, and wonderful monument of the old Ice-period. You ought\r\nto give a woodcut. How many have blundered over those horrid shelves!\r\n\r\nThat was a capital paper by Jamieson in the last \"Geol. Journal.\"\r\n(528/1. \"On the Drift and Rolled Gravel of the North of Scotland,\"\r\n\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XVI., page 347, 1860.) I was never\r\nbefore fully convinced of the land glacialisation of Scotland before,\r\nthough Chambers tried hard to convince me.\r\n\r\nI must say I differ rather about Ramsay's paper; perhaps he pushes it\r\ntoo far. (528/2. \"On the Glacial Origin of Certain Lakes, etc.\" \"Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XVIII., page 185. See Letter 503.) It struck\r\nme the more from remembering some years ago marvelling what could be\r\nthe meaning of such a multitude of lakes in Friesland and other northern\r\ndistricts. Ramsay wrote to me, and I suggested that he ought to compare\r\nmountainous tropical regions with northern regions. I could not remember\r\nmany lakes in any mountainous tropical country. When Tyndall talks of\r\nevery valley in Switzerland being formed by glaciers, he seems to forget\r\nthere are valleys in the tropics; and it is monstrous, in my opinion,\r\nthe accounting for the Glacial period in the Alps by greater height\r\nof mountains, and their lessened height, if I understand, by glacial\r\nerosion. \"Ne sutor ultra crepidam,\" I think, applies in this case to\r\nhim. I am hard at work on \"Variation under Domestication.\" (528/3.\r\nPublished 1868.)\r\n\r\nP.S.--I am rather overwhelmed with letters at present, and it has just\r\noccurred to me that perhaps you will forward my note to Mr. Jamieson; as\r\nit will show that I entirely yield. I do believe every word in my Glen\r\nRoy paper is false.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 529. TO C. LYELL. Down, October 20th [1861].\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the orchids, I have been very glad to see Jamieson's\r\nletter; no doubt, as he says, certainty will soon be reached.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the minor points of Glen Roy, I cannot feel easy with\r\na mere barrier of ice; there is so much sloping, stratified detritus in\r\nthe valleys. I remember that you somewhere have stated that a running\r\nstream soon cuts deeply into a glacier. I have been hunting up all old\r\nreferences and pamphlets, etc., on shelves in Scotland, and will\r\nsend them off to Mr. J., as they possibly may be of use to him if he\r\ncontinues the subject. The Eildon Hills ought to be specially examined.\r\nAmongst MS. I came across a very old letter from me to you, in which I\r\nsay: \"If a glacialist admitted that the sea, before the formation of the\r\nshelves, covered the country (which would account for the land-straits\r\nabove the level of the shelves), and if he admitted that the land\r\ngradually emerged, and if he supposed that his lakes were banked up by\r\nice alone, he would make out, in my opinion, the best case against the\r\nmarine origin of the shelves.\" (529/1. See Letter 522.) This seems very\r\nmuch what you and Mr. J. have come to.\r\n\r\nThe whole glacial theory is really a magnificent subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 530. TO C. LYELL. Down, April 1st [1862].\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure that I understand your difficulty, so I must give\r\nwhat seems to me the explanation of the glacial lake theory at some\r\nlittle length. You know that there is a rocky outlet at the level of\r\nall the shelves. Please look at my map. (530/1. The map accompanying\r\nMr. Darwin's paper in the \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" 1839.) I suppose whole\r\nvalley of Glen Spean filled with ice; then water would escape from\r\nan outlet at Loch Spey, and the highest shelf would be first formed.\r\nSecondly, ice began to retreat, and water will flow for short time over\r\nits surface; but as soon as it retreated from behind the hill marked\r\nCraig Dhu, where the outlet on level of second shelf was discovered by\r\nMilne (530/2. See note, Letter 521.), the water would flow from it and\r\nthe second shelf would be formed. This supposes that a vast barrier\r\nof ice still remains under Ben Nevis, along all the lower part of the\r\nSpean. Lastly, I suppose the ice disappeared everywhere along L. Loggan,\r\nL. Treig, and Glen Spean, except close under Ben Nevis, where it still\r\nformed a barrier, the water flowing out at level of lowest shelf by the\r\nPass of Mukkul at head of L. Loggan. This seems to me to account for\r\neverything. It presupposes that the shelves were formed towards the\r\nclose of the Glacial period. I come up to London to read on Thursday a\r\nshort paper at the Linnean Society. Shall I call on Friday morning at\r\n9.30 and sit half an hour with you? Pray have no scruple to send a line\r\nto Queen Anne Street to say \"No\" if it will take anything out of you. If\r\nI do not hear, I will come.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 531. TO J. PRESTWICH. Down, January 3rd, 1880.\r\n\r\nYou are perfectly right. (531/1. Prof. Prestwich's paper on Glen Roy was\r\npublished in the \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" for 1879, page 663.) As soon as\r\nI read Mr. Jamieson's article on the parallel roads, I gave up the ghost\r\nwith more sighs and groans than on almost any other occasion in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.IX.IV. CORAL REEFS, FOSSIL AND RECENT, 1841-1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 532. TO C. LYELL. Shrewsbury, Tuesday, 6th [July, 1841].\r\n\r\nYour letter was forwarded me here. I was the more glad to receive it, as\r\nI never dreamed of your being able to find time to write, now that you\r\nmust be so very busy; and I had nothing to tell you about myself, else I\r\nshould have written. I am pleased to hear how extensive and successful\r\na trip you appear to have made. You must have worked hard, and got your\r\nSilurian subject well in your head, to have profited by so short an\r\nexcursion. How I should have enjoyed to have followed you about the\r\ncoral-limestone. I once was close to Wenlock (532/1. The Wenlock\r\nlimestone (Silurian) contains an abundance of corals. \"The rock seems\r\nindeed to have been formed in part by massive sheets and bunches of\r\ncoral\" (Geikie, \"Text-book of Geology,\" 1882, page 678.), something such\r\nas you describe, and made a rough drawing, I remember, of the masses of\r\ncoral. But the degree in which the whole mass was regularly stratified,\r\nand the quantity of mud, made me think that the reefs could never have\r\nbeen like those in the Pacific, but that they most resembled those on\r\nthe east coast of Africa, which seem (from charts and descriptions)\r\nto confine extensive flats and mangrove swamps with mud, or like some\r\nimperfect ones about the West India Islands, within the reefs of which\r\nthere are large swamps. All the reefs I have myself seen could be\r\nassociated only with nearly pure calcareous rocks. I have received a\r\ndescription of a reef lying some way off the coast near Belize (terra\r\nfirma), where a thick bed of mud seems to have invaded and covered a\r\ncoral reef, leaving but very few islets yet free from it. But I can\r\ngive you no precise information without my notes (even if then) on these\r\nheads...\r\n\r\nBermuda differs much from any other island I am acquainted with. At\r\nfirst sight of a chart it resembles an atoll; but it differs from this\r\nstructure essentially in the gently shelving bottom of the sea all round\r\nto some distance; in the absence of the defined circular reefs, and, as\r\na consequence, of the defined central pool or lagoon; and lastly, in\r\nthe height of the land. Bermuda seems to be an irregular, circular, flat\r\nbank, encrusted with knolls and reefs of coral, with land formed on one\r\nside. This land seems once to have been more extensive, as on some parts\r\nof the bank farthest removed from the island there are little pinnacles\r\nof rock of the same nature as that of the high larger islands. I cannot\r\npretend to form any precise notion how the foundation of so anomalous an\r\nisland has been produced, but its whole history must be very different\r\nfrom that of the atolls of the Indian and Pacific oceans--though, as\r\nI have said, at first glance of the charts there is a considerable\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 533. TO C. LYELL. [1842.]\r\n\r\nConsidering the probability of subsidence in the middle of the great\r\noceans being very slow; considering in how many spaces, both large ones\r\nand small ones (within areas favourable to the growth of corals), reefs\r\nare absent, which shows that their presence is determined by peculiar\r\nconditions; considering the possible chance of subsidence being more\r\nrapid than the upward growth of the reefs; considering that reefs not\r\nvery rarely perish (as I cannot doubt) on part, or round the whole, of\r\nsome encircled islands and atolls: considering these things, I admit as\r\nvery improbable that the polypifers should continue living on and\r\nabove the same reef during a subsidence of very many thousand feet; and\r\ntherefore that they should form masses of enormous thickness, say at\r\nmost above 5,000 feet. (533/1. \"...As we know that some inorganic causes\r\nare highly injurious to the growth of coral, it cannot be expected that\r\nduring the round of change to which earth, air, and water are exposed,\r\nthe reef-building polypifers should keep alive for perpetuity in any\r\none place; and still less can this be expected during the progressive\r\nsubsidences...to which by our theory these reefs and islands have been\r\nsubjected, and are liable\" (\"The Structure and Distribution of Coral\r\nReefs,\" page 107: London, 1842).) This admission, I believe, is in no\r\nway fatal to the theory, though it is so to certain few passages in my\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nIn the areas where the large groups of atolls stand, and where likewise\r\na few scattered atolls stand between such groups, I always imagined that\r\nthere must have been great tracts of land, and that on such large tracts\r\nthere must have been mountains of immense altitudes. But not, it appears\r\nto me, that one is only justified in supposing that groups of islands\r\nstood there. There are (as I believe) many considerable islands and\r\ngroups of islands (Galapagos Islands, Great Britain, Falkland Islands,\r\nMarianas, and, I believe, Viti groups), and likewise the majority of\r\nsingle scattered islands, all of which a subsidence between 4,000\r\nand 5,000 feet would entirely submerge or would leave only one or two\r\nsummits above water, and hence they would produce either groups of\r\nnothing but atolls, or of atolls with one or two encircled islands. I\r\nam far from wishing to say that the islands of the great oceans have not\r\nsubsided, or may not continue to subside, any number of feet, but if the\r\naverage duration (from all causes of destruction) of reefs on the same\r\nspot is limited, then after this limit has elapsed the reefs would\r\nperish, and if the subsidence continued they would be carried down; and\r\nif the group consisted only of atolls, only open ocean would be left; if\r\nit consisted partly or wholly of encircled islands, these would be left\r\nnaked and reefless, but should the area again become favourable for\r\ngrowth of reefs, new barrier-reefs might be formed round them. As an\r\nillustration of this notion of a certain average duration of reefs on\r\nthe same spot, compared with the average rate of subsidence, we may take\r\nthe case of Tahiti, an island of 7,000 feet high. Now here the present\r\nbarrier-reefs would never be continued upwards into an atoll, although,\r\nshould the subsidence continue at a period long after the death of the\r\npresent reefs, new ones might be formed high up round its sides and\r\nultimately over it. The case resolves itself into: what is the ordinary\r\nheight of groups of islands, of the size of existing groups of atolls\r\n(excepting as many of the highest islands as there now ordinarily occur\r\nencircling barrier-reefs in the existing groups of atolls)? and likewise\r\nwhat is the height of the single scattered islands standing between such\r\ngroups of islands? Subsidence sufficient to bury all these islands (with\r\nthe exception of as many of the highest as there are encircled islands\r\nin the present groups of atolls) my theory absolutely requires, but no\r\nmore. To say what amount of subsidence would be required for this end,\r\none ought to know the height of all existing islands, both single ones\r\nand those in groups, on the face of the globe--and, indeed, of half a\r\ndozen worlds like ours. The reefs may be of much greater [thickness]\r\nthan that just sufficient on an average to bury groups of islands; and\r\nthe probability of the thickness being greater seems to resolve itself\r\ninto the average rate of subsidence allowing upward growth, and average\r\nduration of reefs on the same spot. Who will say what this rate and\r\nwhat this duration is? but till both are known, we cannot, I think, tell\r\nwhether we ought to look for upraised coral formations (putting on one\r\nside denudation) above the unknown limit, say between 3,000 and 5,000\r\nfeet, necessary to submerge groups of common islands. How wretchedly\r\ninvolved do these speculations become.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 534. TO E. VON MOJSISOVICS. Down, January 29th, 1879.\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for the continuation of your fine work on the\r\nTyrolese Dolomites (534/1. \"Dolomitriffe Sudtirols und Venetiens\":\r\nWien, 1878.), with its striking engravings and the maps, which are quite\r\nwonderful from the amount of labour which they exhibit, and its extreme\r\ndifficulty. I well remember more than forty years ago examining a\r\nsection of Silurian limestone containing many corals, and thinking to\r\nmyself that it would be for ever impossible to discover whether the\r\nancient corals had formed atolls or barrier reefs; so you may well\r\nbelieve that your work will interest me greatly as soon as I can find\r\ntime to read it. I am much obliged for your photograph, and from its\r\nappearance rejoice to see that much more good work may be expected from\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI enclose my own photograph, in case you should like to possess a copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 535. TO A. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\n(535/1. Part of this letter is published in \"Life and Letters,\" III.,\r\npages 183, 184.)\r\n\r\nDown, May 5th, 1881.\r\n\r\nIt was very good of you to write to me from Tortugas, as I always feel\r\nmuch interested in hearing what you are about, and in reading your\r\nmany discoveries. It is a surprising fact that the peninsula of Florida\r\nshould have remained at the same level for the immense period requisite\r\nfor the accumulation of so vast a pile of debris. (535/2. Alexander\r\nAgassiz published a paper on \"The Tortugas and Florida Reefs\" in the\r\n\"Mem. Amer. Acad. Arts and Sci.\" XI., page 107, 1885. See also his\r\n\"Three Cruises of the 'Blake,'\" Volume I., 1888.)\r\n\r\nYou will have seen Mr. Murray's views on the formation of atolls and\r\nbarrier reefs. (535/3. \"On the Structure and Origin of Coral Reefs and\r\nIslands,\" \"Proc. R. Soc. Edin.\" Volume X., page 505, 1880. Prof. Bonney\r\nhas given a summary of Sir John Murray's views in Appendix II. of the\r\nthird edition of Darwin's \"Coral Reefs,\" 1889.) Before publishing my\r\nbook, I thought long over the same view, but only as far as ordinary\r\nmarine organisms are concerned, for at that time little was known of the\r\nmultitude of minute oceanic organisms. I rejected this view, as from\r\nthe few dredgings made in the 'Beagle' in the S. Temperate regions, I\r\nconcluded that shells, the smaller corals, etc., etc., decayed and were\r\ndissolved when not protected by the deposition of sediment; and sediment\r\ncould not accumulate in the open ocean. Certainly shells, etc., were\r\nin several cases completely rotten, and crumbled into mud between my\r\nfingers; but you will know well whether this is in any degree common. I\r\nhave expressly said that a bank at the proper depth would give rise\r\nto an atoll, which could not be distinguished from one formed during\r\nsubsidence. I can, however, hardly believe, in the former presence of as\r\nmany banks (there having been no subsidence) as there are atolls in\r\nthe great oceans, within a reasonable depth, on which minute oceanic\r\norganisms could have accumulated to the thickness of many hundred feet.\r\nI think that it has been shown that the oscillations from great waves\r\nextend down to a considerable depth, and if so the oscillating water\r\nwould tend to lift up (according to an old doctrine propounded by\r\nPlayfair) minute particles lying at the bottom, and allow them to be\r\nslowly drifted away from the submarine bank by the slightest current.\r\nLastly, I cannot understand Mr. Murray, who admits that small calcareous\r\norganisms are dissolved by the carbonic acid in the water at great\r\ndepths, and that coral reefs, etc., etc., are likewise dissolved near\r\nthe surface, but that this does not occur at intermediate depths, where\r\nhe believes that the minute oceanic calcareous organisms accumulate\r\nuntil the bank reaches within the reef-building depth. But I suppose\r\nthat I must have misunderstood him.\r\n\r\nPray forgive me for troubling you at such a length, but it has occurred\r\nto me that you might be disposed to give, after your wide experience,\r\nyour judgment. If I am wrong, the sooner I am knocked on the head and\r\nannihilated so much the better. It still seems to me a marvellous thing\r\nthat there should not have been much and long-continued subsidence in\r\nthe beds of the great oceans. I wish that some doubly rich millionaire\r\nwould take it into his head to have borings made in some of the Pacific\r\nand Indian atolls, and bring home cores for slicing from a depth of 500\r\nor 600 feet. (535/4. In 1891 a Committee of the British Association was\r\nformed for the investigation of an atoll by means of boring. The Royal\r\nSociety took up the scheme, and an expedition was sent to Funafuti, with\r\nProf. Sollas as leader. Another expedition left Sydney in 1897 under the\r\ndirection of Prof. Edgeworth David, and a deeper boring was made. The\r\nReports will be published in the \"Philosophical Transactions,\" and will\r\ncontain Prof. David's notes upon the boring and the island generally,\r\nDr. Hinde's description of the microscopic structure of the cores and\r\nother examinations of them, carried on at the Royal College of Science,\r\nSouth Kensington. The boring reached a depth of 1114 feet; the cores\r\nwere found to consist entirely of reef-forming corals in situ and in\r\nfragments, with foraminifera and calcareous algae; at the bottom there\r\nwere no traces of any other kind of rock. It seems, therefore, to us,\r\nthat unless it can be proved that reef-building corals began their work\r\nat depths of at least 180 fathoms--far below that hitherto assigned--the\r\nresult gives the strongest support to Darwin's theory of subsidence; the\r\ntest which Darwin wished to be applied has been fairly tried, and the\r\nverdict is entirely in his favour.)\r\n\r\n\r\n2.IX.V. CLEAVAGE AND FOLIATION, 1846-1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 536. TO D. SHARPE.\r\n\r\n(536/1. The following eight letters were written at a time when the\r\nsubjects of cleavage and foliation were already occupying the minds of\r\nseveral geologists, including Sharpe, Sorby, Rogers, Haughton, Phillips,\r\nand Tyndall. The paper by Sharpe referred to was published in 1847\r\n(\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume III.), and his ideas were amplified\r\nin two later papers (ibid., Volume V., 1849, and \"Phil. Trans.\" 1852).\r\nDarwin's own views, based on his observations during the \"Beagle\"\r\nexpedition, had appeared in Chapter XIII. of \"South America\" (1846) and\r\nin the \"Manual of Scientific Enquiry\" (1849), but are perhaps nowhere\r\nso clearly expressed as in this correspondence. His most important\r\ncontribution to the question was in establishing the fact that foliation\r\nis often a part of the same process as cleavage, and is in nowise\r\nnecessarily connected with planes of stratification. Herein he was\r\nopposed to Lyell and the other geologists of the day, but time has\r\nmade good his position. The postscript to Letter 542 is especially\r\ninteresting. We are indebted to Mr. Harker, of St. John's College, for\r\nthis note.)\r\n\r\nDown, August 23rd [1846?].\r\n\r\nI must just send one line to thank you for your note, and to say\r\nhow heartily glad I am that you stick to the cleavage and foliation\r\nquestion. Nothing will ever convince me that it is not a noble subject\r\nof investigation, which will lead some day to great views. I think it\r\nquite extraordinary how little the subject seems to interest British\r\ngeologists. You will, I think live to see the importance of your paper\r\nrecognised. (536/2. Probably the paper \"On Slaty Cleavage.\" \"Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc.\" Volume III., page 74, 1847.) I had always thought\r\nthat Studer was one of the few geologists who had taken a correct and\r\nenlarged view on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 537. TO D. SHARPE. Down [November 1846].\r\n\r\nI have been much interested with your letter, and am delighted that\r\nyou have thought my few remarks worth attention. My observations on\r\nfoliation are more deserving confidence than those on cleavage; for\r\nduring my first year in clay-slate countries, I was quite unaware of\r\nthere being any marked difference between cleavage and stratification; I\r\nwell remember my astonishment at coming to the conclusion that they\r\nwere totally different actions, and my delight at subsequently reading\r\nSedgwick's views (537/1. \"Remarks on the Structure of Large Mineral\r\nMasses, and especially on the Chemical Changes produced in the\r\nAggregation of Stratified Rocks during different periods after their\r\nDeposition.\" \"Trans. Geol. Soc.\" Volume III., page 461, 1835. In the\r\nsection of this paper dealing with cleavage (page 469) Prof. Sedgwick\r\nlays stress on the fact that \"the cleavage is in no instance parallel\r\nto the true beds.\"); hence at that time I was only just getting out of\r\na mist with respect to cleavage-laminae dipping inwards on mountain\r\nflanks. I have certainly often observed it--so often that I thought\r\nmyself justified in propounding it as usual. I might perhaps have been\r\nin some degree prejudiced by Von Buch's remarks, for which in those\r\ndays I had a somewhat greater deference than I now have. The Mount at\r\nM. Video (page 146 of my book (537/2. \"Geol. Obs. S. America.\" page 146.\r\nThe mount is described as consisting of hornblendic slate; \"the laminae\r\nof the slate on the north and south side near the summit dip inwards.\"))\r\nis certainly an instance of the cleavage-laminae of a hornblendic schist\r\ndipping inwards on both sides, for I examined this hill carefully\r\nwith compass in hand and notebook. I entirely admit, however, that a\r\nconclusion drawn from striking a rough balance in one's mind is worth\r\nnothing compared with the evidence drawn from one continuous line of\r\nsection. I read Studer's paper carefully, and drew the conclusion stated\r\nfrom it; but I may very likely be in an error. I only state that I have\r\nfrequently seen cleavage-laminae dipping inwards on mountain sides;\r\nthat I cannot give up, but I daresay a general extension of the rule (as\r\nmight justly be inferred from the manner of my statement) would be quite\r\nerroneous. Von Buch's statement is in his \"Travels in Norway\" (537/3.\r\n\"Travels through Norway and Lapland during the years 1806-8\": London,\r\n1813.); I have unfortunately lost the reference, and it is a high crime,\r\nI confess, even to refer to an opinion without a precise reference. If\r\nyou never read these travels they might be worth skimming, chiefly as an\r\namusement; and if you like and will send me a line by the general\r\npost of Monday or Tuesday, I will either send it up with Hopkins on\r\nWednesday, or bring it myself to the Geological Society. I am very glad\r\nyou are going to read Hopkins (537/4. \"Researches in Physical Geology,\"\r\nby W. Hopkins. \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" 1839, page 381; ibid, 1842, page\r\n43, etc.); his views appear to me eminently worth well comprehending;\r\nfalse views and language appear to me to be almost universally held by\r\ngeologists on the formation of fissures, dikes and mountain chains. If\r\nyou would have the patience, I should be glad if you would read in my\r\n\"Volcanic Islands\" from page 65, or even pages 54 to 72--viz., on\r\nthe lamination of volcanic rocks; I may add that I sent the series\r\nof specimens there described to Professor Forbes of Edinburgh, and he\r\nthought they bore out my views.\r\n\r\nThere is a short extract from Prof. Rogers (537/5. \"On Cleavage of\r\nSlate-strata.\" \"Edinburgh New Phil. Journ.\" Volume XLI., page 422,\r\n1846.) in the last \"Edinburgh New Phil. Journal,\" well worth your\r\nattention, on the cleavage of the Appalachian chain, and which seems far\r\nmore uniform in the direction of dip than in any case which I have met\r\nwith; the Rogers doctrine of the ridge being thrown up by great waves\r\nI believe is monstrous; but the manner in which the ridges have been\r\nthrown over (as if by a lateral force acting on one side on a higher\r\nlevel than on the other) is very curious, and he now states that the\r\ncleavage is parallel to the axis-planes of these thrown-over ridges.\r\nYour case of the limestone beds to my mind is the greatest difficulty\r\non any mechanical doctrine; though I did not expect ever to find\r\nactual displacement, as seems to be proved by your shell evidence. I am\r\nextremely glad you have taken up this most interesting subject in such\r\na philosophical spirit; I have no doubt you will do much in it; Sedgwick\r\nlet a fine opportunity slip away. I hope you will get out another\r\nsection like that in your letter; these are the real things wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 538. TO D. SHARPE. Down, [January 1847].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for the MS., which I return. I do not quite\r\nunderstand from your note whether you have struck out all on this point\r\nin your paper: I much hope not; if you have, allow me to urge on you to\r\nappend a note, briefly stating the facts, and that you omitted them in\r\nyour paper from the observations not being finished.\r\n\r\nI am strongly tempted to suspect that the cleavage planes will be proved\r\nby you to have slided a little over each other, and to have been planes\r\nof incipient tearing, to use Forbes' expression in ice; it will in that\r\ncase be beautifully analogical with my laminated lavas, and these in\r\ncomposition are intimately connected with the metamorphic schists.\r\n\r\nThe beds without cleavage between those with cleavage do not weigh quite\r\nso heavily on me as on you. You remember, of course, Sedgwick's facts\r\nof limestone, and mine of sandstone, breaking in the line of cleavage,\r\ntransversely to the planes of deposition. If you look at cleavage as\r\nI do, as the result of chemical action or crystalline forces,\r\nsuper-induced in certain places by their mechanical state of tension,\r\nthen it is not surprising that some rocks should yield more or less\r\nreadily to the crystalline forces.\r\n\r\nI think I shall write to Prof. Forbes (538/1. Prof. D. Forbes.) of\r\nEdinburgh, with whom I corresponded on my laminated volcanic rocks, to\r\ncall his early attention to your paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 539. TO D. SHARPE. Down, October 16th [1851].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for telling me the results of your\r\nfoliaceous tour, and I am glad you are drawing up an account for the\r\nRoyal Society. (539/1. \"On the Arrangement of the Foliation and Cleavage\r\nof the Rocks of the North of Scotland.\" \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" 1852,\r\npage 445, with Plates XXIII. and XXIV.) I hope you will have a good\r\nillustration or map of the waving line of junction of the slate and\r\nschist with uniformly directed cleavage and foliation. It strikes me as\r\ncrucial. I remember longing for an opportunity to observe this point.\r\nAll that I say is that when slate and the metamorphic schists occur in\r\nthe same neighbourhood, the cleavage and foliation are uniform: of\r\nthis I have seen many cases, but I have never observed slate overlying\r\nmica-slate. I have, however, observed many cases of glossy clay-slate\r\nincluded within mica-schist and gneiss. All your other observations on\r\nthe order, etc., seem very interesting. From conversations with Lyell,\r\netc., I recommend you to describe in a little detail the nature of the\r\nmetamorphic schists; especially whether there are quasi-substrata of\r\ndifferent varieties of mica-slate or gneiss, etc.; and whether you\r\ntraced such quasi beds into the cleavage slate. I have not the least\r\ndoubt of such facts occurring, from what I have seen (and described at\r\nM. Video) of portions of fine chloritic schists being entangled in the\r\nmidst of a gneiss district. Have you had any opportunity of tracing a\r\nbed of marble? This, I think, from reasons given at page 166 of my\r\n\"S. America,\" would be very interesting. (539/2. \"I have never had an\r\nopportunity of tracing, for any distance, along the line both of strike\r\nand dip, the so-called beds in the metamorphic schists, but I strongly\r\nsuspect that they would not be found to extend, with the same character,\r\nvery far in the line either of their dip or strike. Hence I am led to\r\nbelieve that most of the so-called beds are of the nature of complex\r\nfolia, and have not been separately deposited. Of course, this view\r\ncannot be extended to THICK masses included in the metamorphic series,\r\nwhich are of totally different composition from the adjoining schists,\r\nand which are far-extended, as is sometimes the case with quartz\r\nand marble; these must generally be of the nature of true strata\"\r\n(\"Geological Observations,\" page 166).) A suspicion has sometimes\r\noccurred to me (I remember more especially when tracing the clay-slate\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope turning into true gneiss) that possibly all the\r\nmetamorphic schists necessarily once existed as clay-slate, and that\r\nthe foliation did not arise or take its direction in the metamorphic\r\nschists, but resulted simply from the pre-existing cleavage. The\r\nso-called beds in the metamorphic schists, so unlike common cleavage\r\nlaminae, seems the best, or at least one argument against such a\r\nsuspicion. Yet I think it is a point deserving your notice. Have you\r\nthought at all over Rogers' Law, as he reiterates it, of cleavage being\r\nparallel to his axes-planes of elevation?\r\n\r\nIf you know beforehand, will you tell me when your paper is read, for\r\nthe chance of my being able to attend? I very seldom leave home, as I\r\nfind perfect quietude suits my health best.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: CHARLES DARWIN, Cir. 1854. Maull & Fox, photo. Walker &\r\nCockerell, ph. sc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 540. TO C. LYELL. Down, January 10th, 1855.\r\n\r\nI received your letter yesterday, but was unable to answer it, as I had\r\nto go out at once on business of importance. I am very glad that you\r\nare reconsidering the subject of foliation; I have just read over what\r\nI have written on the subject, and admire it very much, and abide by it\r\nall. (540/1. \"Geological Observations on South America,\" Chapter VI.,\r\n1846.) You will not readily believe how closely I attended to the\r\nsubject, and in how many and wide areas I verified my remarks. I see I\r\nhave put pretty strongly the mechanical view of origin; but I might even\r\nthen, but was afraid, have put my belief stronger. Unfortunately I have\r\nnot D. Sharpe's paper here to look over, but I think his chief points\r\n[are] (1) the foliation forming great symmetrical curves, and (2)\r\nthe proof from effects of form of shell (540/2. This refers to the\r\ndistortion of shells in cleaved rocks.) of the mechanical action in\r\ncleaved rocks. The great curvature would be, I think, a grand discovery\r\nof Sharpe's, but I confess there is some want of minuteness in the\r\nstatement of Sharpe which makes me wish to see his facts confirmed. That\r\nthe foliation and cleavage are parts of curves I am quite prepared,\r\nfrom what I have seen, to believe; but the simplicity and grandeur of\r\nSharpe's curves rather stagger me. I feel deeply convinced that when\r\n(and I and Sharpe have seen several most striking and obvious examples)\r\ngreat neighbouring or alternating regions of true metamorphic schists\r\nand clay-slate have their foliations and cleavage parallel, there is\r\nno way of escaping the conclusion, that the layers of pure quartz,\r\nfeldspar, mica, chlorite, etc., etc., are due not to original\r\ndeposition, but to segregation; and this is I consider the point which I\r\nhave established. This is very odd, but I suspect that great metamorphic\r\nareas are generally derived from the metamorphosis of clay-slate, and\r\nnot from alternating layers of ordinary sedimentary matter. I think you\r\nhave exactly put the chief difficulty in its strongest light--viz. what\r\nwould be the result of pure or nearly pure layers of very different\r\nmineralogical composition being metamorphosed? I believe even such might\r\nbe converted into an ordinary varying mass of metamorphic schists. I am\r\ncertain of the correctness of my account of patches of chlorite schists\r\nenclosed in other schist, and of enormous quartzose veins of segregation\r\nbeing absolutely continuous and contemporaneous with the folia of\r\nquartz, and such, I think, might be the result of the folia crossing\r\na true stratum of quartz. I think my description of the wonderful and\r\nbeautiful laminated volcanic rocks at Ascension would be worth your\r\nlooking at. (540/3. \"Geological Observations on S. America,\" pages 166,\r\n167; also \"Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands,\" Chapter\r\nIII. (Ascension), 1844.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 541. TO C. LYELL. Down, January 14th [1855].\r\n\r\nWe were yesterday and the day before house-hunting, so I could not\r\nanswer your letter. I hope we have succeeded in a house, after infinite\r\ntrouble, but am not sure, in York Place, Baker Street.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that I either read or heard from Sharpe about the\r\nGrampians; otherwise from my own old suspicion I should not have\r\ninserted the passage in the manual.\r\n\r\nThe laminated rocks at Ascension are described at page 54. (541/1.\r\n\"Volcanic Islands,\" page 54. \"Singular laminated beds alternating with\r\nand passing into obsidian.\")\r\n\r\nAs far as my experience has gone, I should speak only of clay-slate\r\nbeing associated with mica-slate, for when near the metamorphic schists\r\nI have found stratification so gone that I should not dare to speak of\r\nthem as overlying them. With respect to the difficulty of beds of quartz\r\nand marble, this has for years startled me, and I have longed (since I\r\nhave felt its force) to have some opportunity of testing this point,\r\nfor without you are sure that the beds of quartz dip, as well as strike,\r\nparallel to the foliation, the case is only just like true strata of\r\nsandstone included in clay-slate and striking parallel to the cleavage\r\nof the clay-slate, but of course with different dip (excepting in those\r\nrare cases when cleavage and stratification are parallel). Having this\r\ndifficulty before my eyes, I was much struck with MacCulloch's statement\r\n(page 166 of my \"S. America\") about marble in the metamorphic series not\r\nforming true strata.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 6.)\r\n\r\nYour expectation of the metamorphic schists sending veins into\r\nneighbouring rocks is quite new to me; but I much doubt whether you have\r\nany right to assume fluidity from almost any amount of molecular\r\nchange. I have seen in fine volcanic sandstone clear evidence of all\r\nthe calcareous matter travelling at least 4 1/2 feet in distance to\r\nconcretions on either hand (page 113 of \"S. America\") (541/2. \"Some\r\nof these concretions (flattened spherical concretions composed of hard\r\ncalcareous sandstone, containing a few shells, occurring in a bed of\r\nsandstone) were 4 feet in diameter, and in a horizontal line 9 feet\r\napart, showing that the calcareous matter must have been drawn to the\r\ncentres of attraction from a distance of four feet and a half on both\r\nsides\" (\"Geological Observations on S. America,\" page 113).) I have not\r\nexamined carefully, from not soon enough seeing all the difficulties;\r\nbut I believe, from what I have seen, that the folia in the metamorphic\r\nschists (I do not here refer to the so-called beds) are not of great\r\nlength, but thin out, and are succeeded by others; and the notion I have\r\nof the molecular movements is shown in the indistinct sketch herewith\r\nsent [Figure 6]. The quartz of the strata might here move into the\r\nposition of the folia without much more movement of molecules than in\r\nthe formation of concretions. I further suspect in such cases as this,\r\nwhen there is a great original abundance of quartz, that great branching\r\ncontemporaneous veins of segregation (as sometimes called) of quartz\r\nwould be formed. I can only thus understand the relation which exists\r\nbetween the distorted foliation (not appearing due to injection) and the\r\npresence of such great veins.\r\n\r\nI believe some gneiss, as the gneiss-granite of Humboldt, has been as\r\nfluid as granite, but I do not believe that this is usually the case,\r\nfrom the frequent alternations of glossy clay and chlorite slates, which\r\nwe cannot suppose to have been melted.\r\n\r\nI am far from wishing to doubt that true sedimentary strata have been\r\nconverted into metamorphic schists: all I can say is, that in the three\r\nor four great regions, where I could ascertain the relations of the\r\nmetamorphic schists to the neighbouring cleaved rocks, it was impossible\r\n(as it appeared to me) to admit that the foliation was due to aqueous\r\ndeposition. Now that you intend agitating the subject, it will soon be\r\ncleared up.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 542. TO C. LYELL. 27, York Place, Baker Street [1855].\r\n\r\nI have received your letter from Down, and I have been studying my S.\r\nAmerican book.\r\n\r\nI ought to have stated [it] more clearly, but undoubtedly in W. Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, where clay-slate passes by alternation into a grand district\r\nof mica-schist, and in the Chonos Islands and La Plata, where glossy\r\nslates occur within the metamorphic schists, the foliation is parallel\r\nto the cleavage--i.e. parallel in strike and dip; but here comes, I am\r\nsorry and ashamed to say, a great hiatus in my reasoning. I have assumed\r\nthat the cleavage in these neighbouring or intercalated beds was (as in\r\nmore distant parts) distinct from stratification. If you choose to\r\nsay that here the cleavage was or might be parallel to true bedding,\r\nI cannot gainsay it, but can only appeal to apparent similarity to\r\nthe great areas of uniformity of strike and high angle--all certainly\r\nunlike, as far as my experience goes, to true stratification. I have\r\nlong known how easily I overlook flaws in my own reasoning, and this is\r\na flagrant case. I have been amused to find, for I had quite forgotten,\r\nhow distinctly I give a suspicion (top of page 155) to the idea, before\r\nSharpe, of cleavage (not foliation) being due to the laminae forming\r\nparts of great curves. (542/1. \"I suspect that the varying and opposite\r\ndips (of the cleavage-planes) may possibly be accounted for by the\r\ncleavage-laminae...being parts of large abrupt curves, with their\r\nsummits cut off and worn down\" (\"Geological Observations on S. America,\"\r\npage 155). I well remember the fine section at the end of a region where\r\nthe cleavage (certainly cleavage) had been most uniform in strike and\r\nmost variable in dip.\r\n\r\nI made with really great care (and in MS. in detail) observations on\r\na case which I believe is new, and bears on your view of metamorphosis\r\n(page 149, at bottom). (Ibid., page 149.)\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 7.)\r\n\r\nIn a clay-slate porphyry region, where certain thin sedimentary layers\r\nof tuff had by self-attraction shortened themselves into little curling\r\npieces, and then again into crystals of feldspar of large size, and\r\nwhich consequently were all strictly parallel, the series was perfect\r\nand beautiful. Apparently also the rounded grains of quartz had in other\r\nparts aggregated themselves into crystalline nodules of quartz. [Figure\r\n7.]\r\n\r\nI have not been able to get Sorby yet, but shall not probably have\r\nanything to write on it. I am delighted you have taken up the subject,\r\neven if I am utterly floored.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have a presentiment it will turn out that when clay-slate has\r\nbeen metamorphosed the foliation in the resultant schist has been due\r\ngenerally (if not, as I think, always) to the cleavage, and this to a\r\ncertain degree will \"save my bacon\" (please look at my saving clause,\r\npage 167) (542/2. \"As in some cases it appears that where a fissile rock\r\nhas been exposed to partial metamorphic action (for instance, from\r\nthe irruption of granite) the foliation has supervened on the already\r\nexisting cleavage-planes; so, perhaps in some instances, the foliation\r\nof a rock may have been determined by the original planes of deposition\r\nor of oblique current laminae. I have, however, myself never seen such\r\na case, and I must maintain that in most extensive metamorphic areas the\r\nfoliation is the extreme result of that process, of which cleavage is\r\nthe first effect\" (Ibid., page 167).), but [with] other rocks than that,\r\nstratification has been the ruling agent, the strike, but not the dip,\r\nbeing in such cases parallel to any adjoining clay-slate. If this be\r\nso, pre-existing planes of division, we must suppose on my view of the\r\ncause, determining the lines of crystallisation and segregation, and\r\nnot planes of division produced for the first time during the act of\r\ncrystallisation, as in volcanic rocks. If this should ever be proved, I\r\nshall not look back with utter shame at my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 543. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 8th [1856].\r\n\r\nI got your letter of the 1st this morning, and a real good man you have\r\nbeen to write. Of all the things I ever heard, Mrs. Hooker's pedestrian\r\nfeats beat them. My brother is quite right in his comparison of \"as\r\nstrong as a woman,\" as a type of strength. Your letter, after what\r\nyou have seen in the Himalayas, etc., gives me a wonderful idea of the\r\nbeauty of the Alps. How I wish I was one-half or one-quarter as strong\r\nas Mrs. Hooker: but that is a vain hope. You must have had some very\r\ninteresting work with glaciers, etc. When will the glacier structure\r\nand motion ever be settled! When reading Tyndall's paper it seemed to me\r\nthat movement in the particles must come into play in his own doctrine\r\nof pressure; for he expressly states that if there be pressure on all\r\nsides, there is no lamination. I suppose I cannot have understood him,\r\nfor I should have inferred from this that there must have been movement\r\nparallel to planes of pressure. (543/1. Prof. Tyndall had published\r\npapers \"On Glaciers,\" and \"On some Physical Properties of Ice\" (\"Proc.\r\nR. Inst.\" 1854-58) before the date of this letter. In 1856 he wrote\r\na paper entitled \"Observations on 'The Theory of the Origin of Slaty\r\nCleavage,' by H.C. Sorby.\" \"Phil. Mag.\" XII., 1856, page 129.)\r\n\r\nSorby read a paper to the Brit. Assoc., and he comes to the conclusion\r\nthat gneiss, etc., may be metamorphosed cleavage or strata; and I\r\nthink he admits much chemical segregation along the planes of division.\r\n(543/2. \"On the Microscopical Structure of Mica-schist:\" \"Brit. Ass.\r\nRep.\" 1856, page 78. See also Letters 540-542.) I quite subscribe to\r\nthis view, and should have been sorry to have been so utterly wrong, as\r\nI should have been if foliation was identical with stratification.\r\n\r\nI have been nowhere and seen no one, and really have no news of any kind\r\nto tell you. I have been working away as usual, floating plants in salt\r\nwater inter alia, and confound them, they all sink pretty soon, but at\r\nvery different rates. Working hard at pigeons, etc., etc. By the way,\r\nI have been astonished at the differences in the skeletons of domestic\r\nrabbits. I showed some of the points to Waterhouse, and asked him\r\nwhether he could pretend that they were not as great as between species,\r\nand he answered, \"They are a great deal more.\" How very odd that no\r\nzoologist should ever have thought it worth while to look to the real\r\nstructure of varieties...\r\n\r\n\r\n2.IX.VI. AGE OF THE WORLD, 1868-1877.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 544. TO J. CROLL. Down, September 19th, 1868.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will allow me to thank you for sending me your papers\r\nin the \"Phil. Magazine.\" (544/1. Croll published several papers in\r\nthe \"Philosophical Magazine\" between 1864 and the date of this letter\r\n(1868).) I have never, I think, in my life been so deeply interested\r\nby any geological discussion. I now first begin to see what a million\r\nmeans, and I feel quite ashamed of myself at the silly way in which I\r\nhave spoken of millions of years. I was formerly a great believer in the\r\npower of the sea in denudation, and this was perhaps natural, as most of\r\nmy geological work was done near sea-coasts and on islands. But it is a\r\nconsolation to me to reflect that as soon as I read Mr. Whitaker's paper\r\n(544/2. \"On Subaerial Denudation,\" and \"On Cliffs and Escarpments of\r\nthe Chalk and Lower Tertiary Beds,\" \"Geol. Mag.\" Volume IV., page 447,\r\n1867.) on the escarpments of England, and Ramsay (544/3. \"Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc.\" Volume XVIII., page 185, 1862. \"On the Glacial Origin of\r\ncertain Lakes in Switzerland, the Black Forest, Great Britain, Sweden,\r\nNorth America, and elsewhere.') and Jukes' papers (544/4. \"Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc.\" Volume XVIII., page 378, 1862. \"On the Mode of Formation of\r\nsome River-Valleys in the South of Ireland.\"), I gave up in my own mind\r\nthe case; but I never fully realised the truth until reading your papers\r\njust received. How often I have speculated in vain on the origin of the\r\nvalleys in the chalk platform round this place, but now all is clear. I\r\nthank you cordially for having cleared so much mist from before my eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 545. TO T. MELLARD READE. Down, February 9th, 1877.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your kind note, and the present of your essay.\r\nI have read it with great interest, and the results are certainly most\r\nsurprising. (545/1. Presidential Address delivered by T. Mellard Reade\r\nbefore the Liverpool Geological Society (\"Proc. Liverpool Geol. Soc.\"\r\nVolume III., pt. iii., page 211, 1877). See also \"Examination of a\r\nCalculation of the Age of the Earth, based upon the hypothesis of the\r\nPermanence of Oceans and Continents.\" \"Geol. Mag.\" Volume X., page 309,\r\n1883.) It appears to me almost monstrous that Professor Tait should\r\nsay that the duration of the world has not exceeded ten million years.\r\n(545/2. \"Lecture on Some Recent Advances in Physical Science,\" by P.G.\r\nTait, London, 1876.) The argument which seems the most weighty in favour\r\nof the belief that no great number of millions of years have elapsed\r\nsince the world was inhabited by living creatures is the rate at which\r\nthe temperature of the crust increases, and I wish that I could see this\r\nargument answered.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 546. TO J. CROLL. Down, August 9th, 1877.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your essay, which I have read with the greatest\r\ninterest. With respect to the geological part, I have long wished to see\r\nthe evidence collected on the time required for denudation, and you have\r\ndone it admirably. (546/1. In a paper \"On the Tidal Retardation Argument\r\nfor the Age of the Earth\" (\"Brit. Assoc. Report,\" 1876, page 88), Croll\r\nreverts to the influence of subaerial denudation in altering the form of\r\nthe earth as an objection to the argument from tidal retardation. He had\r\npreviously dealt with this subject in \"Climate and Time,\" Chapter\r\nXX., London, 1875.) I wish some one would in a like spirit compare\r\nthe thickness of sedimentary rocks with the quickest estimated rate of\r\ndeposition by a large river, and other such evidence. Your main argument\r\nwith respect to the sun seems to me very striking.\r\n\r\nMy son George desires me to thank you for his copy, and to say how much\r\nhe has been interested by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.IX.VII. GEOLOGICAL ACTION OF EARTHWORMS, 1880-1882.\r\n\r\n\"My whole soul is absorbed with worms just at present.\" (From a letter\r\nto Sir W. Thistleton-Dyer, November 26th, 1880.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 547. TO T.H. FARRER (Lord Farrer).\r\n\r\n(547/1. The five following letters, written shortly before and after the\r\npublication of \"The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of\r\nWorms,\" 1881, deal with questions connected with Mr. Darwin's work on\r\nthe habits and geological action of earthworms.)\r\n\r\nDown, October 20th, 1880.\r\n\r\nWhat a man you are to do thoroughly whatever you undertake to do! The\r\nsupply of specimens has been magnificent, and I have worked at them for\r\na day and a half. I find a very few well-rounded grains of brick in\r\nthe castings from over the gravel walk, and plenty over the hole in the\r\nfield, and over the Roman floor. (547/2. See \"The Formation of Vegetable\r\nMould,\" 1881, pages 178 et seq. The Roman remains formed part of a villa\r\ndiscovered at Abinger, Surrey. Excavations were carried out, under Lord\r\nFarrer's direction, in a field adjoining the ground in which the Roman\r\nvilla was first found, and extended observations were made by Lord\r\nFarrer, which led Mr. Darwin to conclude that a large part of the fine\r\nvegetable mould covering the floor of the villa had been brought up\r\nfrom below by worms.) You have done me the greatest possible service\r\nby making me more cautious than I should otherwise have been--viz., by\r\nsending me the rubbish from the road itself; in this rubbish I find\r\nvery many particles, rounded (I suppose) by having been crushed, angles\r\nknocked off, and somewhat rolled about. But not a few of the particles\r\nmay have passed through the bodies of worms during the years since the\r\nroad was laid down. I still think that the fragments are ground in the\r\ngizzards of worms, which always contain bits of stone; but I must try\r\nand get more evidence. I have to-day started a pot with worms in very\r\nfine soil, with sharp fragments of hard tiles laid on the surface, and\r\nhope to see in the course of time whether any of those become rounded. I\r\ndo not think that more specimens from Abinger would aid me...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 548. TO G.J. ROMANES. Down, March 7th.\r\n\r\nI was quite mistaken about the \"Gardeners' Chronicle;\" in my index there\r\nare only the few enclosed and quite insignificant references having any\r\nrelation to the minds of animals. When I returned to my work, I found\r\nthat I had nearly completed my statement of facts about worms plugging\r\nup their burrows with leaves (548/1. Chapter II., of \"The Formation\r\nof Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms,\" 1881, contains a\r\ndiscussion on the intelligence shown by worms in the manner of plugging\r\nup their burrows with leaves (pages 78 et seq.).), etc., etc., so I\r\nwaited until I had naturally to draw up a few concluding remarks. I hope\r\nthat it will not bore you to read the few accompanying pages, and in the\r\nmiddle you will find a few sentences with a sort of definition of, or\r\nrather discussion on, intelligence. I am altogether dissatisfied with\r\nit. I tried to observe what passed in my own mind when I did the work\r\nof a worm. If I come across a professed metaphysician, I will ask him\r\nto give me a more technical definition, with a few big words about the\r\nabstract, the concrete, the absolute, and the infinite; but seriously, I\r\nshould be grateful for any suggestions, for it will hardly do to assume\r\nthat every fool knows what \"intelligent\" means. (548/2. \"Mr. Romanes,\r\nwho has specially studied the minds of animals, believes that we can\r\nsafely infer intelligence only when we see an individual profiting\r\nby its own experience...Now, if worms try to drag objects into their\r\nburrows, first in one way and then in another, until they at last\r\nsucceed, they profit, at least in each particular instance, by\r\nexperience\" (\"The Formation of Vegetable Mould,\" 1881, page 95).) You\r\nwill understand that the MS. is only the first rough copy, and will need\r\nmuch correction. Please return it, for I have no other copy--only a few\r\nmemoranda. When I think how it has bothered me to know what I mean by\r\n\"intelligent,\" I am sorry for you in your great work on the minds of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nI daresay that I shall have to alter wholly the MS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 549. TO FRANCIS GALTON. Down, March 8th [1881].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your note. I have been observing the [worm] tracks\r\non my walks for several months, and they occur (or can be seen) only\r\nafter heavy rain. As I know that worms which are going to die (generally\r\nfrom the parasitic larva of a fly) always come out of their burrows,\r\nI have looked out during these months, and have usually found in the\r\nmorning only from one to three or four along the whole length of my\r\nwalks. On the other hand, I remember having in former years seen scores\r\nor hundreds of dead worms after heavy rain. (549/1. \"After heavy\r\nrain succeeding dry weather, an astonishing number of dead worms may\r\nsometimes be seen lying on the ground. Mr. Galton informs me that on\r\none occasion (March, 1881), the dead worms averaged one for every\r\ntwo-and-a-half paces in length on a walk in Hyde Park, four paces in\r\nwidth\" (loc. cit., page 14).) I cannot possibly believe that worms are\r\ndrowned in the course of even three or four days' immersion; and I am\r\ninclined to conclude that the death of sickly (probably with parasites)\r\nworms is thus hastened. I will add a few words to what I have said about\r\nthese tracks. Occasionally worms suffer from epidemics (of what nature I\r\nknow not) and die by the million on the surface of the ground. Your ruby\r\npaper answers capitally, but I suspect that it is only for dimming the\r\nlight, and I know not how to illuminate worms by the same intensity of\r\nlight, and yet of a colour which permits the actinic rays to pass. I\r\nhave tried drawing triangles of damp paper through a small cylindrical\r\nhole, as you suggested, and I can discover no source of error. (549/2.\r\nTriangles of paper were used in experiments to test the intelligence of\r\nworms (loc. cit., page 83).) Nevertheless, I am becoming more doubtful\r\nabout the intelligence of worms. The worst job is that they will do\r\ntheir work in a slovenly manner when kept in pots (549/3. Loc. cit.,\r\npage 75.), and I am beyond measure perplexed to judge how far such\r\nobservations are trustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 550. TO E. RAY LANKESTER.\r\n\r\n(550/1. Mr. Lankester had written October 11th, 1881, to thank Mr.\r\nDarwin for the present of the Earthworm book. He asks whether Darwin\r\nknows of \"any experiments on the influence of sea-water on earthworms.\r\nI have assumed that it is fatal to them. But there is a littoral species\r\n(Pontodrilus of Perrier) found at Marseilles.\" Lankester adds, \"It is\r\na great pleasure and source of pride to me to see my drawing of the\r\nearthworm's alimentary canal figuring in your pages.\"\r\n\r\nDown, October 13th [1881].\r\n\r\nI have been much pleased and interested by your note. I never actually\r\ntried sea-water, but I was very fond of angling when a boy, and as I\r\ncould not bear to see the worms wriggling on the hook, I dipped them\r\nalways first in salt water, and this killed them very quickly. I\r\nremember, though not very distinctly, seeing several earthworms dead on\r\nthe beach close to where a little brook entered, and I assumed that they\r\nhad been brought down by the brook, killed by the sea-water, and cast\r\non shore. With your skill and great knowledge, I have no doubt that you\r\nwill make out much new about the anatomy of worms, whenever you take up\r\nthe subject again.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 551. TO J.H. GILBERT. Down, January, 12th, 1882.\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by your letter, for which I thank you\r\nheartily. There was not the least cause for you to apologise for not\r\nhaving written sooner, for I attributed it to the right cause, i.e. your\r\nhands being full of work.\r\n\r\nYour statement about the quantity of nitrogen in the collected castings\r\nis most curious, and much exceeds what I should have expected. In lately\r\nreading one of your and Mr. Lawes' great papers in the \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions\" (551/1. The first Report on \"Agricultural, Botanical,\r\nand Chemical Results of Experiments on the Mixed Herbage of Permanent\r\nGrassland, conducted for many years in succession on the same land,\" was\r\npublished in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" in\r\n1880, the second paper appeared in the \"Phil. Trans.\" for 1882, and the\r\nthird in the \"Phil. Trans.\" of 1900, Volume 192, page 139.) (the value\r\nand importance of which cannot, in my opinion, be exaggerated) I\r\nwas struck with the similarity of your soil with that near here; and\r\nanything observed here would apply to your land. Unfortunately I have\r\nnever made deep sections in this neighbourhood, so as to see how deep\r\nthe worms burrow, except in one spot, and here there had been left on\r\nthe surface of the chalk a little very fine ferruginous sand, probably\r\nof Tertiary age; into this the worms had burrowed to a depth of 55 and\r\n61 inches. I have never seen here red castings on the surface, but it\r\nseems possible (from what I have observed with reddish sand) that much\r\nof the red colour of the underlying clay would be discharged in passing\r\nthrough the intestinal canal.\r\n\r\nWorms usually work near the surface, but I have noticed that at certain\r\nseasons pale-coloured earth is brought up from beneath the outlying\r\nblackish mould on my lawn; but from what depth I cannot say. That some\r\nmust be brought up from a depth of four or five or six feet is certain,\r\nas the worms retire to this depth during very dry and very cold weather.\r\nAs worms devour greedily raw flesh and dead worms, they could devour\r\ndead larvae, eggs, etc., etc., in the soil, and thus they might locally\r\nadd to the amount of nitrogen in the soil, though not of course if the\r\nwhole country is considered. I saw in your paper something about\r\nthe difference in the amount of nitrogen at different depths in the\r\nsuperficial mould, and here worms may have played a part. I wish that\r\nthe problem had been before me when observing, as possibly I might have\r\nthrown some little light on it, which would have pleased me greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.IX.VIII. MISCELLANEOUS, 1846-1878.\r\n\r\n(552/1. The following four letters refer to questions connected with the\r\norigin of coal.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 552. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May [1846].\r\n\r\nI am delighted that you are in the field, geologising or\r\npalaeontologising. I beg you to read the two Rogers' account of the\r\nCoal-fields of N. America; in my opinion they are eminently instructive\r\nand suggestive. (552/1. \"On the Physical Structure of the Appalachian\r\nChain,\" by W.B. and H.D. Rogers. Boston, 1843. See also \"Geology of\r\nPennsylvania,\" by H.D. Rogers. 4 volumes. London and Philadelphia,\r\n1843.) I can lend you their resume of their own labours, and, indeed, I\r\ndo not know that their work is yet published in full. L. Horner gives\r\na capital balance of difficulties on the Coal-theory in his last\r\nAnniversary Address, which, if you have not read, will, I think,\r\ninterest you. (552/2. \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume II., 1846, page\r\n170.) In a paper just read an author (552/3. \"On the Remarkable Fossil\r\nTrees lately discovered near St. Helen's.\" By E.W. Binney. \"Phil.\r\nMag.\" Volume XXIV., page 165, 1844. On page 173 the author writes: \"The\r\nStigmaria or Sigillaria, whichever name is to be retained... was a\r\ntree that undoubtedly grew in water.\") throws out the idea that the\r\nSigillaria was an aquatic plant (552/4. See \"Life and Letters,\" I.,\r\npages 356 et seq.)--I suppose a Cycad-Conifer with the habits of the\r\nmangrove. From simple geological reasoning I have for some time been led\r\nto suspect that the great (and great and difficult it is) problem of\r\nthe Coal would be solved on the theory of the upright plants having been\r\naquatic. But even on such, I presume improbable notion, there are, as it\r\nstrikes me, immense difficulties, and none greater than the width of the\r\ncoal-fields. On what kind of coast or land could the plants have lived?\r\nIt is a grand problem, and I trust you will grapple with it. I shall\r\nlike much to have some discussion with you. When will you come here\r\nagain? I am very sorry to infer from your letter that your sister has\r\nbeen ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 553. TO J.D. HOOKER. [June 2nd, 1847.]\r\n\r\nI received your letter the other day, full of curious facts, almost all\r\nnew to me, on the coal-question. (553/1. Sir Joseph Hooker deals with\r\nthe formation of coal in his classical paper \"On the Vegetation of the\r\nCarboniferous Period, as compared with that of the Present Day.\" \"Mem.\r\nGeol. Surv. Great Britain,\" Volume II., pt. ii., 1848.) I will bring\r\nyour note to Oxford (553/2. The British Association met at Oxford in\r\n1847.), and then we will talk it over. I feel pretty sure that some of\r\nyour purely geological difficulties are easily solvable, and I can, I\r\nthink, throw a very little light on the shell difficulty. Pray put\r\nno stress in your mind about the alternate, neatly divided, strata of\r\nsandstone and shale, etc. I feel the same sort of interest in the coal\r\nquestion as a man does watching two good players at play, he knowing\r\nlittle or nothing of the game. I confess your last letter (and this\r\nyou will think very strange) has almost raised Binney's notion (an old,\r\ngrowing hobby-horse of mine) to the dignity of an hypothesis (553/3.\r\nBinney suggested that the Coal-plants grew in salt water. (See Letters\r\n102, 552.) Recent investigations have shown that several of the plants\r\nof the Coal period possessed certain anatomical peculiarities, which\r\nindicate xerophytic characteristics, and lend support to the view that\r\nsome at least of the plants grew in seashore swamps.), though very far\r\nyet below the promotion of being properly called a theory.\r\n\r\nI will bring the remainder of my species-sketch to Oxford to go over\r\nyour remarks. I have lately been getting a good many rich facts. I saw\r\nthe poor old Dean of Manchester (553/4. Dean Herbert.) on Friday, and\r\nhe received me very kindly. He looked dreadfully ill, and about an hour\r\nafterwards died! I am most sincerely sorry for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 554. TO J.D. HOOKER. [May 12th, 1847.]\r\n\r\nI cannot resist thanking you for your most kind note. Pray do not\r\nthink that I was annoyed by your letter. I perceived that you had been\r\nthinking with animation, and accordingly expressed yourself strongly,\r\nand so I understood it. Forefend me from a man who weighs every\r\nexpression with Scotch prudence. I heartily wish you all success in your\r\nnoble problem, and I shall be very curious to have some talk with you\r\nand hear your ultimatum. (554/1. The above paragraph was published in\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" I., page 359.) I do really think, after Binney's\r\npamphlet (554/2. \"On the Origin of Coal,\" \"Mem. Lit. Phil. Soc.\"\r\nManchester Volume VIII., page 148, 1848.), it will be worth your while\r\nto array your facts and ideas against an aquatic origin of the coal,\r\nthough I do not know whether you object to freshwater. I am sure I have\r\nread somewhere of the cones of Lepidodendron being found round the\r\nstump of a tree, or am I confusing something else? How interesting all\r\nrooted--better, it seems from what you say, than upright--specimens\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nI wish Ehrenberg would undertake a microscopical hunt for infusoria in\r\nthe underclay and shales; it might reveal something. Would a comparison\r\nof the ashes of terrestrial peat and coal give any clue? (554/3. In an\r\narticle by M. F. Rigaud on \"La Formation de la Houille,\" published in\r\nthe \"Revue Scientifique,\" Volume II., page 385, 1894, the author lays\r\nstress on the absence of certain elements in the ash of coals, which\r\nought to be present, on the assumption that the carbon has been derived\r\nfrom plant tissues. If coal consists of altered vegetable debris, we\r\nought to find a certain amount of alkalies and phosphoric acid in\r\nits ash. Had such substances ever been present, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand how they could all have been removed by the solvent action of\r\nwater. (Rigaud's views are given at greater length in an article on the\r\n\"Structure and Formation of Coal,\" \"Science Progress,\" Volume II., pages\r\n355 and 431, 1895.)) Peat ashes are good manure, and coal ashes, except\r\nmechanically, I believe are of little use. Does this indicate that the\r\nsoluble salts have been washed out? i.e., if they are NOT present. I go\r\nup to Geological Council to-day--so farewell.\r\n\r\n(554/4. In a letter to Sir Joseph Hooker, October 6th, 1847, Mr. Darwin,\r\nin referring to the origin of Coal, wrote: \"...I sometimes think it\r\ncould not have been formed at all. Old Sir Anthony Carlisle once said to\r\nme gravely that he supposed Megatherium and such cattle were just sent\r\ndown from heaven to see whether the earth would support them, and I\r\nsuppose the coal was rained down to puzzle mortals. You must work the\r\ncoal well in India.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 555. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 22nd, 1860.\r\n\r\nLyell tells me that Binney has published in Proceedings of Manchester\r\nSociety a paper trying to show that Coal plants must have grown in very\r\nmarine marshes. (555/1. \"On the Origin of Coal,\" by E.W. Binney, \"Mem.\r\nLit. Phil. Soc. Manchester,\" Volume VIII., 1848, page 148. Binney\r\nexamines the evidence on which dry land has been inferred to exist\r\nduring the formation of the Coal Measures, and comes to the conclusion\r\nthat the land was covered by water, confirming Brongniart's opinion that\r\nSigillaria was an aquatic plant. He believes the Sigillaria \"grew in\r\nwater, on the deposits where it is now discovered, and that it is the\r\nplant which in a great measure contributed to the formation of our\r\nvaluable beds of coal.\" (Loc. cit., page 193.)) Do you remember how\r\nsavage you were long years ago at my broaching such a conjecture?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 556. TO L. HORNER. Down [1846?].\r\n\r\nI am truly pleased at your approval of my book (556/1. \"Geological\r\nObservations on South America,\" London, 1846.): it was very kind of\r\nyou taking the trouble to tell me so. I long hesitated whether I\r\nwould publish it or not, and now that I have done so at a good cost of\r\ntrouble, it is indeed highly satisfactory to think that my labour has\r\nnot been quite thrown away.\r\n\r\nI entirely acquiesce in your criticism on my calling the Pampean\r\nformation \"recent\" (556/2. \"We must, therefore, conclude that the\r\nPampean formation belongs, in the ordinary geological sense of the word,\r\nto the Recent Period.\" (\"Geol. Obs.\" page 101).); Pleistocene would have\r\nbeen far better. I object, however, altogether on principle (whether I\r\nhave always followed my principle is another question) to designate any\r\nepoch after man. It breaks through all principles of classification\r\nto take one mammifer as an epoch. And this is presupposing we know\r\nsomething of the introduction of man: how few years ago all beds earlier\r\nthan the Pleistocene were characterised as being before the monkey\r\nepoch. It appears to me that it may often be convenient to speak of an\r\nHistorical or Human deposit in the same way as we speak of an Elephant\r\nbed, but that to apply it to an epoch is unsound.\r\n\r\nI have expressed myself very ill, and I am not very sure that my notions\r\nare very clear on this subject, except that I know that I have often\r\nbeen made wroth (even by Lyell) at the confidence with which people\r\nspeak of the introduction of man, as if they had seen him walk on the\r\nstage, and as if, in a geological chronological sense, it was more\r\nimportant than the entry of any other mammifer.\r\n\r\nYou ask me to do a most puzzling thing, to point out what is newest in\r\nmy volume, and I found myself incapable of doing almost the same for\r\nLyell. My mind goes from point to point without deciding: what has\r\ninterested oneself or given most trouble is, perhaps quite falsely,\r\nthought newest. The elevation of the land is perhaps more carefully\r\ntreated than any other subject, but it cannot, of course, be called new.\r\nI have made out a sort of index, which will not take you a couple of\r\nminutes to skim over, and then you will perhaps judge what seems newest.\r\nThe summary at the end of the book would also serve same purpose.\r\n\r\nI do not know where E. de B. [Elie de Beaumont] has lately put forth\r\non the recent elevation of the Cordillera. He \"rapported\" favourably\r\non d'Orbigny, who in late times fires off a most Royal salute; every\r\nvolcano bursting forth in the Andes at the same time with their\r\nelevation, the debacle thus caused depositing all the Pampean mud and\r\nall the Patagonian shingle! Is not this making Geology nice and simple\r\nfor beginners?\r\n\r\nWe have been very sorry to hear of Bunbury's severe illness; I believe\r\nthe measles are often dangerous to grown-up people. I am very glad that\r\nyour last account was so much better.\r\n\r\nI am astonished that you should have had the courage to go right through\r\nmy book. It is quite obvious that most geologists find it far easier to\r\nwrite than to read a book.\r\n\r\nChapter I. and II.--Elevation of the land: equability on E. coast as\r\nshown by terraces, page 19; length on W. coast, page 53; height at\r\nValparaiso, page 32; number of periods of rest at Coquimbo, page 49;\r\nelevation within Human period near Lima greater than elsewhere observed;\r\nthe discussion (page 41) on non-horizontality of terraces perhaps one of\r\nnewest features--on formation of terraces rather newish.\r\n\r\nChapter III., page 65.--Argument of horizontal elevation of Cordillera\r\nI believe new. I think the connection (page 54) between earthquake\r\n[shocks] and insensible rising important.\r\n\r\nChapter IV.--The strangeness of the (Eocene) mammifers, co-existing with\r\nrecent shells.\r\n\r\nChapter V.--Curious pumiceous infusorial mudstone (page 118) of\r\nPatagonia; climate of old Tertiary period, page 134. The subject which\r\nhas been most fertile in my mind is the discussion from page 135 to end\r\nof chapter on the accumulation of fossiliferous deposits. (556/3. The\r\nlast section of Chapter V. treats of \"the Absence of extensive modern\r\nConchiferous Deposits in South America; and on the contemporaneousness\r\nof the older Tertiary Deposits at distant points being due to\r\ncontemporaneous movements of subsidence.\" Darwin expresses the view that\r\n\"the earth's surface oscillates up and down; and...during the elevatory\r\nmovements there is but a small chance of durable fossiliferous deposits\r\naccumulating\" (loc. cit., page 139).)\r\n\r\nChapter VI.--Perhaps some facts on metamorphism, but chiefly on the\r\nlayers in mica-slate, etc., being analogous to cleavage.\r\n\r\nChapter VII.--The grand up-and-down movements (and vertical silicified\r\ntrees) in the Cordillera: see summary, page 204 and page 240. Origin of\r\nthe Claystone porphyry formation, page 170.\r\n\r\nChapter VIII., page 224.--Mixture of Cretaceous and Oolitic forms (page\r\n226)--great subsidence. I think (page 232) there is some novelty in\r\ndiscussion on axes of eruption and injection. (page 247) Continuous\r\nvolcanic action in the Cordillera. I think the concluding summary (page\r\n237) would show what are the most salient features in the book.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 557. TO C. LYELL. Shrewsbury [August 10th, 1846].\r\n\r\nI was delighted to receive your letter, which was forwarded here to\r\nme. I am very glad to hear about the new edition of the \"Principles,\"\r\n(557/1. The seventh edition of the \"Principles of Geology\" was published\r\nin 1847.), and I most heartily hope you may live to bring out half a\r\ndozen more editions. There would not have been such books as d'Orbigny's\r\nS. American Geology (557/2. \"Voyage dans l'Amerique meridionale execute\r\npendant les Annees 1826-37.\" 6 volumes, Paris, 1835-43.) published, if\r\nthere had been seven editions of the \"Principles\" distributed in France.\r\nI am rather sorry about the small type; but the first edition, my old\r\ntrue love, which I never deserted for the later editions, was also in\r\nsmall type. I much fear I shall not be able to give any assistance to\r\nBook III. (557/3. This refers to Book III. of the \"Principles\"--\"Changes\r\nof the Organic World now in Progress.\") I think I formerly gave my\r\nfew criticisms, but I will read it over again very soon (though I\r\nam striving to finish my S. American Geology (557/4. \"Geological\r\nObservations on South America\" was published in 1846.)) and see whether\r\nI can give you any references. I have been thinking over the subject,\r\nand can remember no one book of consequence, as all my materials (which\r\nare in an absolute chaos on separate bits of paper) have been picked out\r\nof books not directly treating of the subjects you have discussed, and\r\nwhich I hope some day to attempt; thus Hooker's \"Antarctic Flora\" I have\r\nfound eminently useful (557/5. \"Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H.M.S.\r\n'Erebus' and 'Terror' in the Years 1839-43.\" I., \"Flora Antarctica.\" 2\r\nvolumes, London, 1844-47.), and yet I declare I do not know what\r\nprecise facts I could refer you to. Bronn's \"Geschichte\" (557/6.\r\n\"Naturgeschichte der drei Reiche.\" H.E. Bronn, Stuttgart, 1834-49.)\r\nwhich you once borrowed) is the only systematic book I have met with on\r\nsuch subjects; and there are no general views in such parts as I have\r\nread, but an immense accumulation of references, very useful to follow\r\nup, but not credible in themselves: thus he gives hybrids from ducks and\r\nfowls just as readily as between fowls and pheasants! You can have it\r\nagain if you like. I have no doubt Forbes' essay, which is, I suppose,\r\nnow fairly out, will be very good under geographical head. (557/7. \"On\r\nthe Connection between the Distribution of the existing Fauna and Flora\r\nof the British Isles, and the Geological Changes which have affected\r\ntheir Area, especially during the Epoch of the Northern Drift,\" by E.\r\nForbes. \"Memoirs of Geological Survey,\" Volume I., page 336, 1846.)\r\nKolreuter's German book is excellent on hybrids, but it will cost you a\r\ngood deal of time to work out any conclusion from his numerous details.\r\n(557/8. Joseph Gottlieb Kolreuter's \"Vorlaufige Nachricht von eininigen\r\ndas Geschlecht der Pflanzen betreffenden Versuchen und Beobachtungen.\"\r\nLeipzig, 1761.) With respect to variation I have found nothing--but\r\nminute details scattered over scores of volumes. But I will look over\r\nBook III. again. What a quantity of work you have in hand! I almost wish\r\nyou could have finished America, and thus have allowed yourself rather\r\nmore time for the old \"Principles\"; and I am quite surprised that you\r\ncould possibly have worked your own new matter in within six weeks. Your\r\nintention of being in Southampton will much strengthen mine, and I shall\r\nbe very glad to hear some of your American Geology news.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 558. TO L. HORNER. Down, Sunday [January 1847].\r\n\r\nYour most agreeable praise of my book is enough to turn my head; I am\r\nreally surprised at it, but shall swallow it with very much gusto...\r\n(558/1. \"Geological Observations in S. America,\" London, 1846.)\r\n\r\nE. de Beaumont measured the inclination with a sextant and artificial\r\nhorizon, just as you take the height of the sun for latitude.\r\n\r\nWith respect to my Journal, I think the sketches in the second edition\r\n(558/2. \"Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology of\r\nthe Countries visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. 'Beagle.'\" Edition II.\r\nLondon, 1845.) are pretty accurate; but in the first they are not so,\r\nfor I foolishly trusted to my memory, and was much annoyed to find how\r\nhasty and inaccurate many of my remarks were, when I went over my huge\r\npile of descriptions of each locality.\r\n\r\nIf ever you meet anyone circumstanced as I was, advise him not, on any\r\naccount, to give any sketches until his materials are fully worked out.\r\n\r\nWhat labour you must be undergoing now; I have wondered at your patience\r\nin having written to me two such long notes. How glad Mrs. Horner will\r\nbe when your address is completed. (558/3. Anniversary Address of the\r\nPresident (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume III., page xxii, 1847).) I\r\nmust say that I am much pleased that you will notice my volume in your\r\naddress, for former Presidents took no notice of my two former volumes.\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly glad that Bunbury is going on well.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 559. TO C. LYELL. Down, July 3rd [1849].\r\n\r\nI don't know when I have read a book so interesting (559/1. \"A Second\r\nVisit to the United States of North America.\" 2 volumes, London, 1849.);\r\nsome of your stories are very rich. You ought to be made Minister of\r\nPublic Education--not but what I should think even that beneath the\r\nauthor of the old \"Principles.\" Your book must, I should think, do\r\na great deal of good and set people thinking. I quite agree with the\r\n\"Athenaeum\" that you have shown how a man of science can bring his\r\npowers of observation to social subjects. (559/2. \"Sir Charles Lyell,\r\nbesides the feelings of a gentleman, seems to carry with him the best\r\nhabits of scientific observation into other strata than those of clay,\r\ninto other 'formations' than those of rock or river-margin.\" \"The\r\nAthenaeum,\" June 23rd, 1849, page 640.) You have made H. Wedgwood, heart\r\nand soul, an American; he wishes the States would annex us, and was all\r\nday marvelling how anyone who could pay his passage money was so foolish\r\nas to remain here.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 560. TO C. LYELL. Down, [December, 1849].\r\n\r\n(560/1. In this letter Darwin criticises Dana's statements in his volume\r\non \"Geology,\" forming Volume X. of the \"Wilkes Exploring Expedition,\"\r\n1849.)\r\n\r\n...Dana is dreadfully hypothetical in many parts, and often as \"d--d\r\ncocked sure\" as Macaulay. He writes however so lucidly that he is very\r\npersuasive. I am more struck with his remarks on denudation than you\r\nseem to be. I came to exactly the same conclusion in Tahiti, that the\r\nwonderful valleys there (on the opposite extreme of the scale of wonder\r\n[to] the valleys of New South Wales) were formed exclusively by fresh\r\nwater. He underrates the power of sea, no doubt, but read his remarks\r\non valleys in the Sandwich group. I came to the conclusion in S. America\r\n(page 67) that the main effect of fresh water is to deepen valleys, and\r\nsea to widen them; I now rather doubt whether in a valley or fiord...the\r\nsea would deepen the rock at its head during the elevation of the land.\r\nI should like to tour on the W. coast of Scotland, and attend to this.\r\nI forget how far generally the shores of fiords (not straits) are\r\ncliff-formed. It is a most interesting subject.\r\n\r\nI return once again to Coral. I find he does not differ so much in\r\ndetail with me regarding areas of subsidence; his map is coloured on\r\nsome quite unintelligible principle, and he deduces subsidence from the\r\nvaguest grounds, such as that the N. Marianne Islands must have subsided\r\nbecause they are small, though long in volcanic action: and that the\r\nMarquesas subsided because they are penetrated by deep bays, etc., etc.\r\nI utterly disbelieve his statements that most of the atolls have\r\nbeen lately raised a foot or two. He does not condescend to notice\r\nmy explanation for such appearances. He misrepresents me also when he\r\nstates that I deduce, without restriction, elevation from all fringing\r\nreefs, and even from islands without any reefs! If his facts are true,\r\nit is very curious that the atolls decrease in size in approaching the\r\nvast open ocean S. of the Sandwich Islands. Dana puts me in a passion\r\nseveral times by disputing my conclusions without condescending to\r\nallude to my reasons; thus, regarding S. Lorenzo elevation, he is\r\npleased to speak of my \"characteristic accuracy\" (560/2. Dana's\r\n\"Geology\" (Wilkes expedition), page 590.), and then gives difficulties\r\n(as if his own) when they are stated by me, and I believe explained\r\nby me--whereas he only alludes to a few of the facts. So in Australian\r\nvalleys, he does not allude to my several reasons. But I am forgetting\r\nmyself and running on about what can only interest myself. He strikes me\r\nas a very clever fellow; I wish he was not quite so grand a generaliser.\r\nI see little of interest except on volcanic action and denudation, and\r\nhere and there scattered remarks; some of the later chapters are very\r\nbald.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 561. TO J.D. DANA. Down, December 5th, 1849.\r\n\r\nI have not for some years been so much pleased as I have just been\r\nby reading your most able discussion on coral reefs. I thank you most\r\nsincerely for the very honourable mention you make of me. (561/1.\r\n\"United States Exploring Expedition during the Years 1839-42 under the\r\nCommand of Charles Wilkes, U.S.N.\" Volume X., \"Geology,\" by J.D. Dana,\r\n1849.) This day I heard that the atlas has arrived, and this completes\r\nyour munificent present to me. I have not yet come to the chapter\r\non subsidence, and in that I fancy we shall disagree, but in the\r\ndescriptive part our agreement has been eminently satisfactory to me,\r\nand far more than I ever ventured to anticipate. I consider that now\r\nthe subsidence theory is established. I have read about half through\r\nthe descriptive part of the \"Volcanic Geology\" (561/2. Part of Dana's\r\n\"Geology\" is devoted to volcanic action.) (last night I ascended the\r\npeaks of Tahiti with you, and what I saw in my short excursion was most\r\nvividly brought before me by your descriptions), and have been most\r\ndeeply interested by it. Your observations on the Sandwich craters\r\nstrike me as the most important and original of any that I have read\r\nfor a long time. Now that I have read yours, I believe I saw at the\r\nGalapagos, at a distance, instances of those most curious fissures of\r\neruption. There are many points of resemblance between the Galapagos and\r\nSandwich Islands (even to the shape of the mound-like hills)--viz., in\r\nthe liquidity of the lavas, absence of scoriae, and tuff-craters. Many\r\nof your scattered remarks on denudation have particularly interested me;\r\nbut I see that you attribute less to sea and more to running water than\r\nI have been accustomed to do. After your remarks in your last very kind\r\nletter I could not help skipping on to the Australian valleys (561/3.\r\nIbid., pages 526 et seq.: \"The Formation of Valleys, etc., in New South\r\nWales.\"), on which your remarks strike me as exceedingly ingenious and\r\nnovel, but they have not converted me. I cannot conceive how the great\r\nlateral bays could have been scooped out, and their sides rendered\r\nprecipitous by running water. I shall go on and read every word of your\r\nexcellent volume.\r\n\r\nIf you look over my \"Geological Instructions\" you will be amused to\r\nsee that I urge attention to several points which you have elaborately\r\ndiscussed. (561/4. \"A Manual of Scientific Enquiry, prepared for the use\r\nof Her Majesty's Navy, and adapted for Travellers in General.\" Edited by\r\nSir John F.W. Herschel, Bart. London, 1849 (Section VI., \"Geology.\" By\r\nCharles Darwin).) I lately read a paper of yours on Chambers' book, and\r\nwas interested by it. I really believe the facts of the order described\r\nby Chambers, in S. America, which I have described in my Geolog. volume.\r\nThis leads me to ask you (as I cannot doubt that you will have much\r\ngeological weight in N. America) to look to a discussion at page 135\r\nin that volume on the importance of subsidence to the formation of\r\ndeposits, which are to last to a distant age. This view strikes me as of\r\nsome importance.\r\n\r\nWhen I meet a very good-natured man I have that degree of badness of\r\ndisposition in me that I always endeavour to take advantage of him;\r\ntherefore I am going to mention some desiderata, which if you can supply\r\nI shall be very grateful, but if not no answer will be required.\r\n\r\nThank you for your \"Conspectus Crust.,\" but I am sorry to say I am not\r\nworthy of it, though I have always thought the Crustacea a beautiful\r\nsubject. (561/5. \"Conspectus Crustaceorum in orbis terrarum\r\ncircumnavigatione, C. Wilkes duce, collectorum.\" Cambridge (U.S.A.),\r\n1847.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 562. TO C. LYELL. [Down, March 9th, 1850.]\r\n\r\nI am uncommonly much obliged to you for your address, which I had not\r\nexpected to see so soon, and which I have read with great interest.\r\n(562/1. Anniversary Address of the President, \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\"\r\nVolume VI., page 32, 1850.) I do not know whether you spent much time\r\nover it, but it strikes me as extra well arranged and written--done\r\nin the most artistic manner, to use an expression which I particularly\r\nhate. Though I am necessarily pretty well familiar with your ideas from\r\nyour conversation and books, yet the whole had an original freshness\r\nto me. I am glad that you broke through the routine of the President's\r\naddresses, but I should be sorry if others did. Your criticisms on\r\nMurchison were to me, and I think would be to many, particularly\r\nacceptable. (562/2. In a paper \"On the Geological Structure of the Alps,\r\netc.\" (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume V., page 157, 1849) Murchison\r\nexpressed his belief that the apparent inversion of certain Tertiary\r\nstrata along the flanks of the Alps afforded \"a clear demonstration of\r\na sudden operation or catastrophe.\" It is this view of paroxysmal energy\r\nthat Lyell criticises in the address.) Capital, that metaphor of the\r\nclock. (562/3. \"In a word, the movement of the inorganic world is\r\nobvious and palpable, and might be likened to the minute-hand of\r\na clock, the progress of which can be seen and heard, whereas the\r\nfluctuations of the living creation are nearly invisible, and resemble\r\nthe motion of the hour-hand of a timepiece\" (loc. cit., page xlvi).) I\r\nshall next February be much interested by seeing your hour-hand of the\r\norganic world going.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kindness in taking the trouble to tell me of the\r\nanniversary dinner. What a compliment that was which Lord Mahon paid me!\r\nI never had so great a one. He must be as charming a man as his wife is\r\na woman, though I was formerly blind to his merit. Bunsen's speech must\r\nhave been very interesting and very useful, if any orthodox clergyman\r\nwere present. Your metaphor of the pebbles of pre-existing languages\r\nreminds me that I heard Sir J. Herschel at the Cape say how he wished\r\nsome one would treat language as you had Geology, and study the existing\r\ncauses of change, and apply the deduction to old languages.\r\n\r\nWe are all pretty flourishing here, though I have been retrograding a\r\nlittle, and I think I stand excitement and fatigue hardly better than in\r\nold days, and this keeps me from coming to London. My cirripedial task\r\nis an eternal one; I make no perceptible progress. I am sure that they\r\nbelong to the hour-hand, and I groan under my task.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 563. C. LYELL TO CHARLES DARWIN. April 23rd, 1855.\r\n\r\nI have seen a good deal of French geologists and palaeontologists\r\nlately, and there are many whom I should like to put on the R.S. Foreign\r\nList, such as D'Archiac, Prevost, and others. But the man who has made\r\nthe greatest sacrifices and produced the greatest results, who has, in\r\nfact, added a new period to the calendar, is Barrande.\r\n\r\nThe importance of his discoveries as they stand before the public fully\r\njustify your choice of him; but what is unpublished, and which I\r\nhave seen, is, if possible, still more surprising. Thirty genera of\r\ngasteropods (150 species) and 150 species of lamellibranchiate bivalves\r\nin the Silurian! All obtained by quarries opened solely by him for\r\nfossils. A man of very moderate fortune spending nearly all his capital\r\non geology, and with success.\r\n\r\nE. Forbes' polarity doctrines are nearly overturned by the unpublished\r\ndiscoveries of Barrande. (563/1. See note, Letter 41, Volume I.)\r\n\r\nI have called Barrande's new period Cambrian (see \"Manual,\" 5th\r\nedition), and you will see why. I could not name it Protozoic, but had\r\nBarrande called it Bohemian, I must have adopted that name. All the\r\nFrench will rejoice if you confer an honour on Barrande. Dana is well\r\nworthy of being a foreign member.\r\n\r\nShould you succeed in making Barrande F.R.S., send me word.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 564. TO J.D. HOOKER. June 5th [1857].\r\n\r\n(564/1. The following, which bears on the subject of medals, forms part\r\nof the long letter printed in the \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 100.)\r\n\r\nI do not quite agree with your estimate of Richardson's merits. Do, I\r\nbeg you (whenever you quietly see), talk with Lyell on Prestwich: if\r\nhe agrees with Hopkins, I am silenced; but as yet I must look at the\r\ncorrelation of the Tertiaries as one of the highest and most frightfully\r\ndifficult tasks a man could set himself, and excellent work, as I\r\nbelieve, P. has done. (564/2. Prof. Prestwich had published numerous\r\npapers dealing with Tertiary Geology before 1857. The contributions\r\nreferred to are probably those \"On the Correlation of the Lower\r\nTertiaries of England with those of France and Belgium,\" \"Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc.\" Volume X., 1854, page 454; and \"On the Correlation of the\r\nMiddle Eocene Tertiaries of England, France, and Belgium,\" ibid., XII.,\r\n1856, page 390.) I confess I do not value Hopkins' opinion on such a\r\npoint. I confess I have never thought, as you show ought to be done, on\r\nthe future. I quite agree, under all circumstances, with the propriety\r\nof Lindley. How strange no new geologists are coming forward! Are there\r\nnot lots of good young chemists and astronomers or physicists? Fitton\r\nis the only old geologist left who has done good work, except Sedgwick.\r\nHave you thought of him? He would be a brilliant companion for Lindley.\r\nOnly it would never do to give Lyell a Copley and Sedgwick a Royal in\r\nthe same year. It seems wrong that there should be three Natural Science\r\nmedals in the same year. Lindley, Sedgwick, and Bunsen sounds well,\r\nand Lyell next year for the Copley. (564/3. In 1857 a Royal medal was\r\nawarded to John Lindley; Lyell received the Copley in 1858, and Bunsen\r\nin 1860.) You will see that I am speculating as a mere idle amateur.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 565. TO S.P. WOODWARD. Down, May 27th [1856].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for having taken the trouble to answer\r\nmy query so fully. I can now be at rest, for from what you say and from\r\nwhat little I remember Forbes said, my point is unanswerable. The case\r\nof Terebratula is to the point as far as it goes, and is negative.\r\nI have already attempted to get a solution through geographical\r\ndistribution by Dr. Hooker's means, and he finds that the same genera\r\nwhich have very variable species in Europe have other very variable\r\nspecies elsewhere. This seems the general rule, but with some few\r\nexceptions. I see from the several reasons which you assign, that there\r\nis no hope of comparing the same genus at two different periods, and\r\nseeing whether the tendency to vary is greater at one period in such\r\ngenus than at another period. The variability of certain genera or\r\ngroups of species strikes me as a very odd fact. (565/1. The late Dr.\r\nNeumayr has dealt, to some extent, with this subject in \"Die Stamme des\r\nThierreichs,\" Volume I., Wien, 1889.)\r\n\r\nI shall have no points, as far as I can remember, to suggest for your\r\nreconsideration, but only some on which I shall have to beg for a little\r\nfurther information. However, I feel inclined very much to dispute your\r\ndoctrine of islands being generally ancient in comparison, I presume,\r\nwith continents. I imagine you think that islands are generally remnants\r\nof old continents, a doctrine which I feel strongly disposed to doubt. I\r\nbelieve them generally rising points; you, it seems, think them sinking\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 566. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, April 14th [1860].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind and pleasant letter. I have been much\r\ninterested by \"Deep-sea Soundings,\", and will return it by this post, or\r\nas soon as I have copied a few sentences. (566/1. Specimens of the mud\r\ndredged by H.M.S. \"Cyclops\" were sent to Huxley for examination, who\r\ngave a brief account of them in Appendix A of Capt. Dayman's Report,\r\n1858, under the title \"Deep-sea Soundings in the North Atlantic.\")\r\nI think you said that some one was investigating the soundings. I\r\nearnestly hope that you will ask the some one to carefully observe\r\nwhether any considerable number of the calcareous organisms are more or\r\nless friable, or corroded, or scaling; so that one might form some crude\r\nnotion whether the deposition is so rapid that the foraminifera are\r\npreserved from decay and thus are forming strata at this profound depth.\r\nThis is a subject which seems to me to have been much neglected in\r\nexamining soundings.\r\n\r\nBronn has sent me two copies of his Morphologische Studien uber die\r\nGestaltungsgesetze.\" (H.G. Bronn, \"Morphologische Studien uber die\r\nGestaltungsgesetze der Naturkorper uberhaupt und der organischen\r\ninsbesondere\": Leipzig, 1858.) It looks elementary. If you will write\r\nyou shall have the copy; if not I will give it to the Linnean Library.\r\n\r\nI quite agree with the letter from Lyell that your extinguished\r\ntheologians lying about the cradle of each new science, etc., etc., is\r\nsplendid. (566/2. \"Darwiniana, Collected Essays,\" Volume II., page 52.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 567. TO T.H. HUXLEY. May 10th [1862 or later].\r\n\r\nI have been in London, which has prevented my writing sooner. I am very\r\nsorry to hear that you have been ill: if influenza, I can believe in any\r\ndegree of prostration of strength; if from over-work, for God's sake do\r\nnot be rash and foolish. You ask for criticisms; I have none to give,\r\nonly impressions. I fully agree with your \"skimming-of-pot theory,\" and\r\nvery well you have put it. With respect [to] contemporaneity I nearly\r\nagree with you, and if you will look to the d--d book, 3rd edition, page\r\n349 you will find nearly similar remarks. (567/1. \"When the marine forms\r\nare spoken of as having changed simultaneously throughout the world, it\r\nmust not be supposed that this expression relates to the same year, or\r\nto the same century, or even that it has a very strict geological sense;\r\nfor if all the marine animals now living in Europe, and all those that\r\nlived in Europe during the Pleistocene period (a very remote period as\r\nmeasured by years, including the whole Glacial epoch), were compared\r\nwith those now existing in South America or in Australia, the most\r\nskilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the present or\r\nthe Pleistocene inhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of\r\nthe Southern hemisphere.\" \"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 298. The passage\r\nin Edition III., page 350, is substantially the same.) But at page 22\r\nof your Address, in my opinion you put your ideas too far. (567/2.\r\nAnniversary Address to the Geological Society of London (\"Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc.\" Volume XVIII., page xl, 1862). As an illustration of the\r\nmisleading use of the term \"contemporaneous\" as employed by geologists,\r\nHuxley gives the following illustration: \"Now suppose that, a million\r\nor two of years hence, when Britain has made another dip beneath the sea\r\nand has come up again, some geologist applies this doctrine [i.e.,\r\nthe doctrine of the Contemporaneity of the European and of the North\r\nAmerican Silurians: proof of contemporaneity is considered to be\r\nestablished by the occurrence of 60 per cent. of species in common], in\r\ncomparing the strata laid bare by the upheaval of the bottom, say, of\r\nSt. George's Channel with what may then remain of the Suffolk Crag.\r\nReasoning in the same way, he will at once decide the Suffolk Crag and\r\nthe St. George's Channel beds to be contemporaneous; although we happen\r\nto know that a vast period...of time...separates the two\" (loc. cit.,\r\npage xlv). This address is republished in the \"Collected Essays,\" Volume\r\nVIII.; the above passage is at page 284.) I cannot think that\r\nfuture geologists would rank the Suffolk and St. George's strata as\r\ncontemporaneous, but as successive sub-stages; they rank N. America\r\nand British stages as contemporaneous, notwithstanding a percentage\r\nof different species (which they, I presume, would account for by\r\ngeographical difference) owing to the parallel succession of the forms\r\nin both countries. For terrestrial productions I grant that great errors\r\nmay creep in (567/3. Darwin supposes that terrestrial productions have\r\nprobably not changed to the same extent as marine organisms. \"If the\r\nMegatherium, Mylodon...had been brought to Europe from La Plata, without\r\nany information in regard to their geological position, no one would\r\nhave suspected that they had co-existed with sea shells all still\r\nliving\" (\"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 298).); but I should require\r\nstrong evidence before believing that, in countries at all well-known,\r\nso-called Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous strata could\r\nbe contemporaneous. You seem to me on the third point, viz., on\r\nnon-advancement of organisation, to have made a very strong case. I have\r\nnot knowledge or presumption enough to criticise what you say. I have\r\nsaid what I could at page 363 of \"Origin.\" It seems to me that the whole\r\ncase may be looked at from several points of view. I can add only\r\none miserable little special case of advancement in cirripedes. The\r\nsuspicion crosses me that if you endeavoured your best you would say\r\nmore on the other side. Do you know well Bronn in his last Entwickelung\r\n(or some such word) on this subject? it seemed to me very well done.\r\n(567/4. Probably \"Untersuchungen uber die Entwickelungsgesetze der\r\norganischen Welt wahrend der Bildungszeit unserer Erdoberflache,\"\r\nStuttgart, 1858. Translated by W.S. Dallas in the \"Ann. and Mag. Nat.\r\nHist.\" Volume IV., page 81.) I hope before you publish again you will\r\nread him again, to consider the case as if you were a judge in a court\r\nof appeal; it is a very important subject. I can say nothing against\r\nyour side, but I have an \"inner consciousness\" (a highly philosophical\r\nstyle of arguing!) that something could be said against you; for I\r\ncannot help hoping that you are not quite as right as you seem to be.\r\nFinally, I cannot tell why, but when I finished your Address I felt\r\nconvinced that many would infer that you were dead against change of\r\nspecies, but I clearly saw that you were not. I am not very well, so\r\ngood-night, and excuse this horrid letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 568. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 30th [1866].\r\n\r\nI have heard from Sulivan (who, poor fellow, gives a very bad account\r\nof his own health) about the fossils (568/1. In a letter to Huxley (June\r\n4th, 1866) Darwin wrote: \"Admiral Sulivan several years ago discovered\r\nan astonishingly rich accumulation of fossil bones not far from the\r\nStraits [of Magellan]...During many years it has seemed to me extremely\r\ndesirable that these should be collected; and here is an excellent\r\nopportunity.\")... The place is Gallegos, on the S. coast of Patagonia.\r\nSulivan says that in the course of two or three days all the boats in\r\nthe ship could be filled twice over; but to get good specimens out of\r\nthe hardish rock two or three weeks would be requisite. It would be a\r\ngrand haul for Palaeontology. I have been thinking over your lecture.\r\n(568/2. A lecture on \"Insular Floras\" given at the British Association\r\nmeeting at Nottingham, August 27th, 1866, published in the \"Gard.\r\nChron.\" 1867.) Will it not be possible to give enlarged drawings of\r\nsome leading forms of trees? You will, of course, have a large map, and\r\nGeorge tells me that he saw at Sir H. James', at Southampton, a map of\r\nthe world on a new principle, as seen from within, so that almost 4/5ths\r\nof the globe was shown at once on a large scale. Would it not be worth\r\nwhile to borrow one of these from Sir H. James as a curiosity to hang\r\nup?\r\n\r\nRemember you are to come here before Nottingham. I have almost finished\r\nthe last number of H. Spencer, and am astonished at its prodigality of\r\noriginal thought. But the reflection constantly recurred to me that each\r\nsuggestion, to be of real value to science, would require years of work.\r\nIt is also very unsatisfactory, the impossibility of conjecturing where\r\ndirect action of external circumstances begins and ends--as he candidly\r\nowns in discussing the production of woody tissue in the trunks of trees\r\non the one hand, and on the other in spines and the shells of nuts. I\r\nshall like to hear what you think of this number when we meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 569. TO A. GAUDRY. Down, November 17th, 1868.\r\n\r\nOn my return home after a short absence I found your note of Nov. 9th,\r\nand your magnificent work on the fossil animals of Attica. (569/1. The\r\n\"Geologie de l'Attique,\" 2 volumes 4to, 1862-7, is the only work of\r\nGaudry's of this date in Mr. Darwin's library.) I assure you that I feel\r\nvery grateful for your generosity, and for the honour which you have\r\nthus conferred on me. I know well, from what I have already read of\r\nextracts, that I shall find your work a perfect mine of wealth. One long\r\npassage which Sir C. Lyell quotes from you in the 10th and last edition\r\nof the \"Principles of Geology\" is one of the most striking which I\r\nhave ever read on the affiliation of species. (569/2. The quotation\r\nin Lyell's \"Principles,\" Edition X., Volume II., page 484, is from M.\r\nGaudry's \"Animaux Fossiles de Pikermi,\" 1866, page 34:--\r\n\r\n\"In how different a light does the question of the nature of species now\r\npresent itself to us from that in which it appeared only twenty years\r\nago, before we had studied the fossil remains of Greece and the allied\r\nforms of other countries. How clearly do these fossil relics point to\r\nthe idea that species, genera, families, and orders now so distinct have\r\nhad common ancestors. The more we advance and fill up the gaps, the more\r\nwe feel persuaded that the remaining voids exist rather in our knowledge\r\nthan in nature. A few blows of the pickaxe at the foot of the Pyrenees,\r\nof the Himalaya, of Mount Pentelicus in Greece, a few diggings in the\r\nsandpits of Eppelsheim, or in the Mauvaises Terres of Nebraska, have\r\nrevealed to us the closest connecting links between forms which seemed\r\nbefore so widely separated. How much closer will these links be drawn\r\nwhen Palaeontology shall have escaped from its cradle!\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 570. A. SEDGWICK TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(570/1. In May, 1870, Darwin \"went to the Bull Hotel, Cambridge, to see\r\nthe boys, and for a little rest and enjoyment.\" (570/2. See \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., 125.) The following letter was received after his return\r\nto Down.)\r\n\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, May 30th, 1870.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nYour very kind letter surprised me. Not that I was surprised at the\r\npleasant and very welcome feeling with which it was written. But I could\r\nnot make out what I had done to deserve the praise of \"extraordinary\r\nkindness to yourself and family.\" I would most willingly have done\r\nmy best to promote the objects of your visit, but you gave me no\r\nopportunity of doing so. I was truly grieved to find that my joy at\r\nseeing you again was almost too robust for your state of nerves, and\r\nthat my society, after a little while, became oppressive to you. But I\r\ndo trust that your Cambridge visit has done you no constitutional harm;\r\nnay, rather that it has done you some good. I only speak honest truth\r\nwhen I say that I was overflowing with joy when I saw you, and saw you\r\nin the midst of a dear family party, and solaced at every turn by\r\nthe loving care of a dear wife and daughters. How different from my\r\nposition--that of a very old man, living in cheerless solitude! May god\r\nhelp and cheer you all with the comfort of hopeful hearts--you and your\r\nwife, and your sons and daughters!\r\n\r\nYou were talking about my style of writing,--I send you my last\r\nspecimen, and it will probably continue to be my last. It is the\r\ncontinuation of a former pamphlet of which I have not one spare copy.\r\nI do not ask you to read it. It is addressed to the old people in my\r\nnative Dale of Dent, on the outskirts of Westmorland. While standing\r\nat the door of the old vicarage, I can see down the valley the Lake\r\nmountains--Hill Bell at the head of Windermere, about twenty miles off.\r\nOn Thursday next (D.V.) I am to start for Dent, which I have not visited\r\nfor full two years. Two years ago I could walk three or four miles with\r\ncomfort. Now, alas! I can only hobble about on my stick.\r\n\r\nI remain your true-hearted old friend A. Sedgwick.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 571. TO C. LYELL. Down, September 3rd [1874].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your very kind and interesting letter. I was glad to\r\nhear at Southampton from Miss Heathcote a good account of your health\r\nand strength.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the great subject to which you refer in your P.S.,\r\nI always try to banish it from my mind as insoluble; but if I were\r\ncircumstanced as you are, no doubt it would recur in the dead of the\r\nnight with painful force. Many persons seem to make themselves quite\r\neasy about immortality (571/1. See \"Life and Letters,\" I., page 312.)\r\nand the existence of a personal God, by intuition; and I suppose that I\r\nmust differ from such persons, for I do not feel any innate conviction\r\non any such points.\r\n\r\nWe returned home about ten days ago from Southampton, and I enjoyed\r\nmy holiday, which did me much good. But already I am much fatigued by\r\nmicroscope and experimental work with insect-eating plants.\r\n\r\nWhen at Southampton I was greatly interested by looking at the odd\r\ngravel deposits near at hand, and speculating about their formation. You\r\nonce told me something about them, but I forget what; and I think that\r\nPrestwich has written on the superficial deposits on the south coasts,\r\nand I must find out his paper and read it. (571/2. Prof. Prestwich\r\ncontributed several papers to the Geological Society on the Superficial\r\nDeposits of the South of England.)\r\n\r\nFrom what I have seen of Mr. Judd's papers I have thought that he would\r\nrank amongst the few leading British geologists.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 572. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(572/1. The following letter was written before Mr. Darwin knew that Sir\r\nCharles Lyell was to be buried in Westminster Abbey, a memorial which\r\nthoroughly satisfied him. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., 197.)\r\n\r\nDown, February 23rd, 1875.\r\n\r\nI have just heard from Miss Buckley of Lyell's death. I have long felt\r\nopposed to the present rage for testimonials; but when I think how\r\nLyell revolutionised Geology, and aided in the progress of so many other\r\nbranches of science, I wish that something could be done in his honour.\r\nOn the other hand it seems to me that a poor testimonial would be worse\r\nthan none; and testimonials seem to succeed only when a man has been\r\nknown and loved by many persons, as in the case of Falconer and Forbes.\r\nNow, I doubt whether of late years any large number of scientific men\r\ndid feel much attachment towards Lyell; but on this head I am very ill\r\nfitted to judge. I should like to hear some time what you think, and if\r\nanything is proposed I should particularly wish to join in it. We have\r\nboth lost as good and as true a friend as ever lived.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 573. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(573/1. This letter shows the difficulty which the inscription for Sir\r\nCharles Lyell's memorial gave his friends. The existing inscription is,\r\n\"Charles Lyell...Author of 'The Principles of Geology'...Throughout\r\na long and laborious life he sought the means of deciphering the\r\nfragmentary records of the Earth's history in the patient investigation\r\nof the present order of Nature, enlarging the boundaries of knowledge,\r\nand leaving on Scientific thought an enduring influence...\"\r\n\r\nDown, June 21st [1876].\r\n\r\nI am sorry for you about the inscription, which has almost burst me. We\r\nthink there are too many plurals in yours, and when read aloud it hisses\r\nlike a goose. I think the omission of some words makes it much stronger.\r\n\"World\" (573/2. The suggested sentence runs: \"he gave to the world the\r\nresults of his labour, etc.\") is much stronger and truer than \"public.\"\r\nAs Lyell wrote various other books and memoirs, I have some little\r\ndoubt about the \"Principles of Geology.\" People here do not like your\r\n\"enduring value\": it sounds almost an anticlimax. They do not much like\r\nmy \"last (or endure) as long as science lasts.\" If one reads a sentence\r\noften enough, it always becomes odious.\r\n\r\nGod help you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 574. TO OSWALD HEER. Down, March 8th [1875].\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very kind and deeply interesting letter of March\r\n1st, received yesterday, and for the present of your work, which no\r\ndoubt I shall soon receive from Dr. Hooker. (574/1. \"Flora Fossilis\r\nArctica,\" Volume III., 1874, sent by Prof. Heer through Sir Joseph\r\nHooker.) The sudden appearance of so many Dicotyledons in the Upper\r\nChalk appears to me a most perplexing phenomenon to all who believe\r\nin any form of evolution, especially to those who believe in extremely\r\ngradual evolution, to which view I know that you are strongly opposed.\r\n(574/2. The volume referred to contains a paper on the Cretaceous\r\nFlora of the Arctic Zone (Spitzbergen and Greenland), in which several\r\ndicotyledonous plants are described. In a letter written by Heer to\r\nDarwin the author speaks of a species of poplar which he describes as\r\nthe oldest Dicotyledon so far recorded.) The presence of even one true\r\nAngiosperm in the Lower Chalk makes me inclined to conjecture that\r\nplants of this great division must have been largely developed in\r\nsome isolated area, whence owing to geographical changes, they at last\r\nsucceeded in escaping, and spread quickly over the world. (574/3. No\r\nsatisfactory evidence has so far been brought forward of the occurrence\r\nof fossil Angiosperms in pre-Cretaceous rocks. The origin of the\r\nMonocotyledons and Dicotyledons remains one of the most difficult and\r\nattractive problems of Palaeobotany.) (574/4. See Letters 395, 398.) But\r\nI fully admit that this case is a great difficulty in the views which I\r\nhold. Many as have been the wonderful discoveries in Geology during the\r\nlast half-century, I think none have exceeded in interest your results\r\nwith respect to the plants which formerly existed in the Arctic regions.\r\nHow I wish that similar collections could be made in the Southern\r\nhemisphere, for instance in Kerguelen's Land.\r\n\r\nThe death of Sir C. Lyell is a great loss to science, but I do not think\r\nto himself, for it was scarcely possible that he could have retained his\r\nmental powers, and he would have suffered dreadfully from their loss.\r\nThe last time I saw him he was speaking with the most lively interest\r\nabout his last visit to you, and I was grieved to hear from him a very\r\npoor account of your health. I have been working for some time on a\r\nspecial subject, namely insectivorous plants. I do not know whether the\r\nsubject will interest you, but when my book is published I will have the\r\npleasure of sending you a copy.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your photograph, and enclose one of myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 574*. TO S.B.J. SKERTCHLY. March 2nd, 1878.\r\n\r\nIt is the greatest possible satisfaction to a man nearly at the close\r\nof his career to believe that he has aided or stimulated an able and\r\nenergetic fellow-worker in the noble cause of science. Therefore your\r\nletter has deeply gratified me. I am writing this away from home, as my\r\nhealth failed, and I was forced to rest; and this will account for the\r\ndelay in answering your letter. No doubt on my return home I shall find\r\nthe memoir which you have kindly sent me. I shall read it with much\r\ninterest, as I have heard something of your work from Prof. Geikie, and\r\nhave read his admirable \"Ice Age.\" (574/5. \"The Great Ice Age and its\r\nRelation to the Antiquity of Man\": London, 1874. By James Geikie.) I\r\nhave noticed the criticisms on your work, but such opposition must\r\nbe expected by every one who draws fine grand conclusions, and such\r\nassuredly are yours as abstracted in your letter. (574/6. Mr. S.B.J.\r\nSkertchly recorded \"the discovery of palaeolithic flint implements,\r\nmammalian bones, and fresh-water shells in brick-earths below the\r\nBoulder-clay of East Anglia,\" in a letter published in the \"Geol. Mag.\"\r\nVolume III., page 476, 1876. (See also \"The Fenland, Past and Present.\"\r\nS.H. Miller and S.B.J. Skertchly, London, 1878.) The conclusions of Mr.\r\nSkertchly as to the pre-Glacial age of the flint implements were not\r\naccepted by some authorities. (See correspondence in \"Nature,\" Volume\r\nXV., 1877, pages 141, 142.) We are indebted to Mr. Marr for calling\r\nour attention to Mr. Skertchly's discovery.) What magnificent progress\r\nGeology has made within my lifetime!\r\n\r\nI shall have very great pleasure in sending you any of my books with my\r\nautograph, but I really do not know which to send. It will cost you only\r\nthe trouble of a postcard to tell me which you would like, and it shall\r\nsoon be sent. Forgive this untidy note, as it is rather an effort to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nWith all good wishes for your continued success in science and for your\r\nhappiness...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.X.--BOTANY, 1843-1871.\r\n\r\n2.X.I.

Down, March 12th [1843].\r\n\r\n...When you next write to your son, will you please remember me kindly\r\nto him and give him my best thanks for his note? I had the pleasure\r\nyesterday of reading a letter from him to Mr. Lyell of Kinnordy, full of\r\nthe most interesting details and descriptions, and written (if I may be\r\npermitted to make such a criticism) in a particularly agreeable style.\r\nIt leads me anxiously to hope, even more than I did before, that he will\r\npublish some separate natural history journal, and not allow (if it can\r\nbe avoided) his materials to be merged in another work. I am very glad\r\nto hear you talk of inducing your son to publish an Antarctic Flora.\r\nI have long felt much curiosity for some discussion on the general\r\ncharacter of the flora of Tierra del Fuego, that part of the globe\r\nfarthest removed in latitude from us. How interesting will be a strict\r\ncomparison between the plants of these regions and of Scotland and\r\nShetland. I am sure I may speak on the part of Prof. Henslow that all\r\nmy collection (which gives a fair representation of the Alpine flora of\r\nTierra del Fuego and of Southern Patagonia) will be joyfully laid at his\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 576. TO JOHN LINDLEY. Down, Saturday [April 8th, 1843].\r\n\r\nI take the liberty, at the suggestion of Dr. Royle, of forwarding to you\r\na few seeds, which have been found under very singular circumstances.\r\nThey have been sent to me by Mr. W. Kemp, of Galashiels, a (partially\r\neducated) man, of whose acuteness and accuracy of observation, from\r\nseveral communications on geological subjects, I have a VERY HIGH\r\nopinion. He found them in a layer under twenty-five feet thickness of\r\nwhite sand, which seems to have been deposited on the margins of an\r\nanciently existing lake. These seeds are not known to the provincial\r\nbotanists of the district. He states that some of them germinated in\r\neight days after being planted, and are now alive. Knowing the interest\r\nyou took in some raspberry seeds, mentioned, I remember, in one of your\r\nworks, I hope you will not think me troublesome in asking you to have\r\nthese seeds carefully planted, and in begging you so far to oblige me as\r\nto take the trouble to inform me of the result. Dr. Daubeny has started\r\nfor Spain, otherwise I would have sent him some. Mr. Kemp is anxious to\r\npublish an account of his discovery himself, so perhaps you will be so\r\nkind as to communicate the result to me, and not to any periodical. The\r\nchance, though appearing so impossible, of recovering a plant lost to\r\nany country if not to the world, appears to me so very interesting, that\r\nI hope you will think it worth while to have these seeds planted, and\r\nnot returned to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 577. TO C. LYELL. [September, 1843.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact has lately, as it were, passed through my hands. A\r\nMr. Kemp (almost a working man), who has written on \"parallel roads,\"\r\nand has corresponded with me (577/1. In a letter to Henslow, Darwin\r\nwrote: \"If he [Mr. Kemp] had not shown himself a most careful and\r\ningenious observer, I should have thought nothing of the case.\"), sent\r\nme in the spring some seeds, with an account of the spot where they\r\nwere found, namely, in a layer at the bottom of a deep sand pit, near\r\nMelrose, above the level of the river, and which sand pit he thinks must\r\nhave been accumulated in a lake, when the whole features of the valleys\r\nwere different, ages ago; since which whole barriers of rock, it\r\nappears, must have been worn down. These seeds germinated freely, and\r\nI sent some to the Horticultural Society, and Lindley writes to me that\r\nthey turn out to be a common Rumex and a species of Atriplex, which\r\nneither he nor Henslow (as I have since heard) have ever seen, and\r\ncertainly not a British plant! Does this not look like a vivification of\r\na fossil seed? It is not surprising, I think, that seeds should last ten\r\nor twenty thousand [years], as they have lasted two or three [thousand\r\nyears] in the Druidical mounds, and have germinated.\r\n\r\nWhen not building, I have been working at my volume on the volcanic\r\nislands which we visited; it is almost ready for press...I hope you will\r\nread my volume, for, if you don't, I cannot think of anyone else who\r\nwill! We have at last got our house and place tolerably comfortable, and\r\nI am well satisfied with our anchorage for life. What an autumn we have\r\nhad: completely Chilian; here we have had not a drop of rain or a cloudy\r\nday for a month. I am positively tired of the fine weather, and long for\r\nthe sight of mud almost as much as I did when in Peru.\r\n\r\n(577/2. The vitality of seeds was a subject in which Darwin continued to\r\ntake an interest. In July, 1855 (\"Life and Letters,\" II., page 65),\r\nhe wrote to Hooker: \"A man told me the other day of, as I thought, a\r\nsplendid instance--and splendid it was, for according to his evidence\r\nthe seed came up alive out of the lower part of the London Clay! I\r\ndisgusted him by telling him that palms ought to have come up.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" 1855, page 758, appeared a notice (half\r\na column in length) by Darwin on the \"Vitality of Seeds.\" The facts\r\nrelated refer to the \"Sand-walk\" at Down; the wood was planted in 1846\r\non a piece of pasture land laid down as grass in 1840. In 1855, on the\r\nsoil being dug in several places, Charlock (Brassica sinapistrum) sprang\r\nup freely. The subject continued to interest him, and we find a note\r\ndated July 2nd, 1874, in which Darwin recorded that forty-six plants\r\nof Charlock sprang up in that year over a space (14 x 7 feet) which had\r\nbeen dug to a considerable depth. In the course of the article in the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" Darwin remarks: \"The power in seeds of retaining\r\ntheir vitality when buried in damp soil may well be an element in\r\npreserving the species, and therefore seeds may be specially endowed\r\nwith this capacity; whereas the power of retaining vitality in a dry\r\nartificial condition must be an indirect, and in one sense accidental,\r\nquality in seeds of little or no use to the species.\"\r\n\r\nThe point of view expressed in the letter to Lyell above given is of\r\ninterest in connection with the research of Horace Brown and F. Escombe\r\n(577/3. \"Proc. Roy. Soc.\" Volume LXII., page 160.) on the remarkable\r\npower possessed by dry seeds of resistance to the temperature of liquid\r\nair. The point of the experiment is that life continues at a temperature\r\n\"below that at which ordinary chemical reactions take place.\" A still\r\nmore striking demonstration of the fact has been made by Thiselton-Dyer\r\nand Dewar who employed liquid hydrogen as a refrigerant. (577/4. Read\r\nbefore the British Association (Dover), 1899, and published in the\r\n\"Comptes rendus,\" 1899, and in the \"Proc. R. Soc.\" LXV., page 361,\r\n1899.) The connection between these facts and the dormancy of buried\r\nseeds is only indirect; but inasmuch as the experiment proves the\r\npossibility of life surviving a period in which no ordinary chemical\r\nchange occurs, it is clear that they help one to believe in greatly\r\nprolonged dormancy in conditions which tend to check metabolism. For a\r\ndiscussion of the bearing of their results on the life-problem, and for\r\nthe literature of the subject, reference should be made to the paper by\r\nBrown and Escombe. See also C. de Candolle \"On Latent Life in Seeds,\"\r\n\"Brit. Assoc. Report,\" 1896, page 1023 and F. Escombe, \"Science\r\nProgress,\" Volume I., N.S., page 585, 1897.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 578. TO J.S. HENSLOW. Down, Saturday [November 5th, 1843].\r\n\r\nI sent that weariful Atriplex to Babington, as I said I would, and\r\nhe tells me that he has reared a facsimile by sowing the seeds of A.\r\nangustifolia in rich soil. He says he knows the A. hastata, and that it\r\nis very different. Until your last note I had not heard that Mr. Kemp's\r\nseeds had produced two Polygonums. He informs me he saw each plant bring\r\nup the husk of the individual seed which he planted. I believe myself in\r\nhis accuracy, but I have written to advise him not to publish, for as\r\nhe collected only two kinds of seeds--and from them two Polygomuns, two\r\nspecies or varieties of Atriplex and a Rumex have come up, any one would\r\nsay (as you suggested) that more probably all the seeds were in the\r\nsoil, than that seeds, which must have been buried for tens of thousands\r\nof years, should retain their vitality. If the Atriplex had turned out\r\nnew, the evidence would indeed have been good. I regret this result of\r\npoor Mr. Kemp's seeds, especially as I believed, from his statements and\r\nthe appearance of the seeds, that they did germinate, and I further have\r\nno doubt that their antiquity must be immense. I am sorry also for the\r\ntrouble you have had. I heard the other day through a circuitous course\r\nhow you are astonishing all the clodhoppers in your whole part of the\r\ncounty: and [what is] far more wonderful, as it was remarked to me, that\r\nyou had not, in doing this, aroused the envy of all the good surrounding\r\nsleeping parsons. What good you must do to the present and all\r\nsucceeding generations. (578/1. For an account of Professor Henslow's\r\nmanagement of his parish of Hitcham see \"Memoir of the Rev. John Stevens\r\nHenslow, M.A.\" by the Rev. Leonard Jenyns: 8vo, London, 1862.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 579. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 14th [1855].\r\n\r\nYou well know how credulous I am, and therefore you will not be\r\nsurprised at my believing the Raspberry story (579/1. This probably\r\nrefers to Lindley's story of the germination of raspberry seeds taken\r\nfrom a barrow 1600 years old.): a very similar case is on record in\r\nGermany--viz., seeds from a barrow; I have hardly zeal to translate it\r\nfor the \"Gardeners' Chronicle.\" (579/2. \"Vitality of Seeds,\" \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle,\" November 17th, 1855, page 758.) I do not go the whole\r\nhog--viz., that sixty and two thousand years are all the same, for I\r\nshould imagine that some slight chemical change was always going on in a\r\nseed. Is this not so? The discussions have stirred me up to send my very\r\nsmall case of the charlock; but as it required some space to give all\r\ndetails, perhaps Lindley will not insert; and if he does, you, you worse\r\nthan an unbelieving dog, will not, I know, believe. The reason I do\r\nnot care to try Mr. Bentham's plan is that I think it would be very\r\ntroublesome, and it would not, if I did not find seed, convince me\r\nmyself that none were in the earth, for I have found in my salting\r\nexperiments that the earth clings to the seeds, and the seeds are very\r\ndifficult to find. Whether washing would do I know not; a gold-washer\r\nwould succeed, I daresay.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 580. TO W.J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nTestimonial from Charles Darwin, Esq., M.A., F.R.S. and G.S., late\r\nNaturalist to Captain Fitz-Roy's Voyage.\r\n\r\nDown House, Farnborough, August 25th, 1845.\r\n\r\nI have heard with much interest that your son, Dr. Hooker, is a\r\ncandidate for the Botanical Chair at Edinburgh. From my former\r\nattendance at that University, I am aware how important a post it is for\r\nthe advancement of science, and I am therefore the more anxious for your\r\nson's success, from my firm belief that no one will fulfil its duties\r\nwith greater zeal or ability. Since his return from the famous Antarctic\r\nexpedition, I have had, as you are aware, much communication with him,\r\nwith respect to the collections brought home by myself, and on other\r\nscientific subjects; and I cannot express too strongly my admiration\r\nat the accuracy of his varied knowledge, and at his powers of\r\ngeneralisation. From Dr. Hooker's disposition, no one, in my opinion,\r\nis more fitted to communicate to beginners a strong taste for those\r\npursuits to which he is himself so ardently devoted. For the sake of\r\nthe advancement of Botany in all its branches, your son has my warmest\r\nwishes for his success.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 581. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Thursday [June 11th, 1847].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kindness about the lodgings--it will be of great\r\nuse to me. (581/1. The British Association met at Oxford in 1847.)\r\nPlease let me know the address if Mr. Jacobson succeeds, for I think I\r\nshall go on the 22nd and write previously to my lodgings. I have since\r\nhad a tempting invitation from Daubeny to meet Henslow, etc., but upon\r\nthe whole, I believe, lodgings will answer best, for then I shall have a\r\nsecure solitary retreat to rest in.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad I sent the Laburnum (581/2. This refers to the\r\ncelebrated form known as Cytisus Adami, of which a full account is given\r\nin \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" Volume I., Edition II., page 413.\r\nIt has been supposed to be a seminal hybrid or graft-hybrid between C.\r\nlaburnum and C. purpureus. It is remarkable for bearing \"on the same\r\ntree tufts of dingy red, bright yellow, and purple flowers, borne on\r\nbranches having widely different leaves and manner of growth.\" In a\r\npaper by Camuzet in the \"Annales de la Societe d'Horticulture de Paris,\r\nXIII., 1833, page 196, the author tries to show that Cytisus Adami is\r\na seminal hybrid between C. alpinus and C. laburnum. Fuchs (\"Sitz. k.\r\nAkad. Wien,\" Bd. 107) and Beijerinck (\"K. Akad. Amsterdam,\" 1900) have\r\nspoken on Cytisus Adami, but throw no light on the origin of the hybrid.\r\nSee letters to Jenner Weir in the present volume.): the raceme grew in\r\ncentre of tree, and had a most minute tuft of leaves, which presented\r\nno unusual appearance: there is now on one raceme a terminal bilateral\r\n[i.e., half yellow, half purple] flower, and on other raceme a single\r\nterminal pure yellow and one adjoining bilateral flower. If you would\r\nlike them I will send them; otherwise I would keep them to see whether\r\nthe bilateral flowers will seed, for Herbert (581/3. Dean Herbert.) says\r\nthe yellow ones will. Herbert is wrong in thinking there are no somewhat\r\nanalogous facts: I can tell you some, when we meet. I know not whether\r\nbotanists consider each petal and stamen an individual; if so, there\r\nseems to me no especial difficulty in the case, but if a flower-bud is a\r\nunit, are not their flowers very strange?\r\n\r\nI have seen Dillwyn in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" and was disgusted\r\nat it, for I thought my bilateral flowers would have been a novelty for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n(581/4. In a letter to Hooker, dated June 2nd, 1847, Darwin makes a bold\r\nsuggestion as to floral symmetry:--)\r\n\r\nI send you a tuft of the quasi-hybrid Laburnum, with two kinds of\r\nflowers on same stalk, and with what strikes [me] as very curious\r\n(though I know it has been observed before), namely, a flower\r\nbilaterally different: one other, I observe, has half its calyx purple.\r\nIs this not very curious, and opposed to the morphological idea that a\r\nflower is a condensed continuous spire of leaves? Does it not look as\r\nif flowers were normally bilateral; just in the same way as we now know\r\nthat the radiating star-fish, etc., are bilateral? The case reminds me\r\nof those insects with exactly half having secondary male characters and\r\nthe other half female.\r\n\r\n(581/5. It is interesting to note his change of view in later years.\r\nIn an undated letter written to Mr. Spencer, probably in 1873, he\r\nsays: \"With respect to asymmetry in the flowers themselves, I remain\r\ncontented, from all that I have seen, with adaptation to visits of\r\ninsects. There is, however, another factor which it is likely enough may\r\nhave come into play--viz., the protection of the anthers and pollen\r\nfrom the injurious effects of rain. I think so because several flowers\r\ninhabiting rainy countries, as A. Kerner has lately shown, bend their\r\nheads down in rainy weather.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 582. TO J.D. HOOKER. June [1855].\r\n\r\n(582/1. This is an early example of Darwin's interest in the movements\r\nof plants. Sleeping plants, as is well-known, may acquire a rhythmic\r\nmovement differing from their natural period, but the precise experiment\r\nhere described has not, as far as known, been carried out. See Pfeffer,\r\n\"Periodische Bewegungen,\" 1875, page 32.)\r\n\r\nI thank you much for Hedysarum: I do hope it is not very precious,\r\nfor, as I told you, it is for probably a most foolish purpose. I read\r\nsomewhere that no plant closes its leaves so promptly in darkness, and I\r\nwant to cover it up daily for half an hour, and see if I can TEACH IT to\r\nclose by itself, or more easily than at first in darkness. I am rather\r\npuzzled about its transmission, from not knowing how tender it is...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 583. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 19th, 1856.\r\n\r\nI thank you warmly for the very kind manner with which you have taken my\r\nrequest. It will, in truth, be a most important service to me; for it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that I should discuss single and double creations,\r\nas a very crucial point on the general origin of species, and I must\r\nconfess, with the aid of all sorts of visionary hypotheses, a very\r\nhostile one. I am delighted that you will take up possibility of\r\ncrossing, no botanist has done so, which I have long regretted, and I am\r\nglad to see that it was one of A. De Candolle's desiderata. By the way,\r\nhe is curiously contradictory on subject. I am far from expecting that\r\nno cases of apparent impossibility will be found; but certainly I expect\r\nthat ultimately they will disappear; for instance, Campanulaceae seems\r\na strong case, but now it is pretty clear that they must be liable to\r\ncrossing. Sweet-peas (583/1. In Lathyrus odoratus the absence of the\r\nproper insect has been supposed to prevent crossing. See \"Variation\r\nunder Domestication,\" Edition II., Volume II., page 68; but the\r\nexplanation there given for Pisum may probably apply to Lathyrus.),\r\nbee-orchis, and perhaps hollyhocks are, at present, my greatest\r\ndifficulties; and I find I cannot experimentise by castrating\r\nsweet-peas, without doing fatal injury. Formerly I felt most interest\r\non this point as one chief means of eliminating varieties; but I feel\r\ninterest now in other ways. One general fact [that] makes me believe in\r\nmy doctrine (583/2. The doctrine which has been epitomised as \"Nature\r\nabhors perpetual self-fertilisation,\" and is generally known as\r\nKnight's Law or the Knight-Darwin Law, is discussed by Francis Darwin in\r\n\"Nature,\" 1898. References are there given to the chief passages in\r\nthe \"Origin of Species,\" etc., bearing on the question. See Letter 19,\r\nVolume I.), is that NO terrestrial animal in which semen is liquid is\r\nhermaphrodite except with mutual copulation; in terrestrial plants in\r\nwhich the semen is dry there are many hermaphrodites. Indeed, I do wish\r\nI lived at Kew, or at least so that I could see you oftener. To return\r\nagain to subject of crossing: I have been inclined to speculate so far,\r\nas to think (my!?) notion (I say MY notion, but I think others have put\r\nforward nearly or quite similar ideas) perhaps explains the frequent\r\nseparation of the sexes in trees, which I think I have heard remarked\r\n(and in looking over the mono- and dioecious Linnean classes in Persoon\r\nseems true) are very apt to have sexes separated; for [in] a tree having\r\na vast number of flowers on the same individual, or at least the same\r\nstock, each flower, if only hermaphrodite on the common plan, would\r\ngenerally get its own pollen or only pollen from another flower on\r\nsame stock,--whereas if the sexes were separate there would be a better\r\nchance of occasional pollen from another distinct stock. I have thought\r\nof testing this in your New Zealand Flora, but I have no standard of\r\ncomparison, and I found myself bothered by bushes. I should propound\r\nthat some unknown causes had favoured development of trees and bushes\r\nin New Zealand, and consequent on this there had been a development\r\nof separation of sexes to prevent too much intermarriage. I do not, of\r\ncourse, suppose the prevention of too much intermarriage the only good\r\nof separation of sexes. But such wild notions are not worth troubling\r\nyou with the reading of.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 584. TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park [May 2nd, 1857].\r\n\r\nThe most striking case, which I have stumbled on, on apparent, but\r\nfalse relation of structure of plants to climate, seems to be Meyer\r\nand Doege's remark that there is not one single, even moderately-sized,\r\nfamily at the Cape of Good Hope which has not one or several species\r\nwith heath-like foliage; and when we consider this together with the\r\nnumber of true heaths, any one would have been justified, had it not\r\nbeen for our own British heaths (584/1. It is well known that plants\r\nwith xerophytic characteristics are not confined to dry climates; it\r\nis only necessary to mention halophytes, alpine plants and certain\r\nepiphytes. The heaths of Northern Europe are placed among the xerophytes\r\nby Warming (\"Lehrbuch der okologischen Pflanzengeographie,\" page 234,\r\nBerlin, 1896).), in saying that heath-like foliage must stand in direct\r\nrelation to a dry and moderately warm climate. Does this not strike you\r\nas a good case of false relation? I am so pleased with this place and\r\nthe people here, that I am greatly tempted to bring Etty here, for she\r\nhas not, on the whole, derived any benefit from Hastings. With thanks\r\nfor your never failing assistance to me...\r\n\r\nI remember that you were surprised at number of seeds germinating in\r\npond mud. I tried a fourth pond, and took about as much mud (rather\r\nmore than in former case) as would fill a very large breakfast cup, and\r\nbefore I had left home 118 plants had come up; how many more will be up\r\non my return I know not. This bears on chance of birds by their muddy\r\nfeet transporting fresh-water plants.\r\n\r\nThis would not be a bad dodge for a collector in country when plants\r\nwere not in seed, to collect and dry mud from ponds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 585. TO ASA GRAY. Down [1857].\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear that you think of discussing the relative ranges\r\nof the identical and allied U. States and European species, when\r\nyou have time. Now this leads me to make a very audacious remark in\r\nopposition to what I imagine Hooker has been writing (585/1. See Letter\r\n338, Volume I.), and to your own scientific conscience. I presume he\r\nhas been urging you to finish your great \"Flora\" before you do anything\r\nelse. Now I would say it is your duty to generalise as far as you safely\r\ncan from your as yet completed work. Undoubtedly careful discrimination\r\nof species is the foundation of all good work; but I must look at such\r\npapers as yours in Silliman as the fruit. As careful observation is far\r\nharder work than generalisation, and still harder than speculation, do\r\nyou not think it very possible that it may be overvalued? It ought never\r\nto be forgotten that the observer can generalise his own observations\r\nincomparably better than any one else. How many astronomers have\r\nlaboured their whole lives on observations, and have not drawn a single\r\nconclusion; I think it is Herschel who has remarked how much better it\r\nwould be if they had paused in their devoted work and seen what they\r\ncould have deduced from their work. So do pray look at this side of the\r\nquestion, and let us have another paper or two like the last admirable\r\nones. There, am I not an audacious dog!\r\n\r\nYou ask about my doctrine which led me to expect that trees would tend\r\nto have separate sexes. I am inclined to believe that no organic being\r\nexists which perpetually self-fertilises itself. This will appear very\r\nwild, but I can venture to say that if you were to read my observations\r\non this subject you would agree it is not so wild as it will at first\r\nappear to you, from flowers said to be always fertilised in bud, etc. It\r\nis a long subject, which I have attended to for eighteen years. Now, it\r\noccurred to me that in a large tree with hermaphrodite flowers, we will\r\nsay it would be ten to one that it would be fertilised by the pollen of\r\nits own flower, and a thousand or ten thousand to one that if crossed\r\nit would be crossed only with pollen from another flower of same tree,\r\nwhich would be opposed to my doctrine. Therefore, on the great principle\r\nof \"Nature not lying,\" I fully expected that trees would be apt to be\r\ndioecious or monoecious (which, as pollen has to be carried from flower\r\nto flower every time, would favour a cross from another individual of\r\nthe same species), and so it seems to be in Britain and New Zealand. Nor\r\ncan the fact be explained by certain families having this structure\r\nand chancing to be trees, for the rule seems to hold both in genera and\r\nfamilies, as well as in species.\r\n\r\nI give you full permission to laugh your fill at this wild speculation;\r\nand I do not pretend but what it may be chance which, in this case, has\r\nled me apparently right. But I repeat that I feel sure that my doctrine\r\nhas more probability than at first it appears to have. If you had not\r\nasked, I should not have written at such length, though I cannot give\r\nany of my reasons.\r\n\r\nThe Leguminosae are my greatest opposers: yet if I were to trust to\r\nobservations on insects made during many years, I should fully expect\r\ncrosses to take place in them; but I cannot find that our garden\r\nvarieties ever cross each other. I do NOT ask you to take any trouble\r\nabout it, but if you should by chance come across any intelligent\r\nnurseryman, I wish you would enquire whether they take any pains\r\nin raising the varieties of papilionaceous plants apart to prevent\r\ncrossing. (I have seen a statement of naturally formed crossed Phaseoli\r\nnear N. York.) The worst is that nurserymen are apt to attribute all\r\nvarieties to crossing.\r\n\r\nFinally I incline to believe that every living being requires an\r\noccasional cross with a distinct individual; and as trees from the mere\r\nmultitude of flowers offer an obstacle to this, I suspect this obstacle\r\nis counteracted by tendency to have sexes separated. But I have\r\nforgotten to say that my maximum difficulty is trees having\r\npapilionaceous flowers: some of them, I know, have their keel-petals\r\nexpanded when ready for fertilisation; but Bentham does not believe\r\nthat this is general: nevertheless, on principle of nature not lying, I\r\nsuspect that this will turn out so, or that they are eminently sought by\r\nbees dusted with pollen. Again I do NOT ask you to take trouble, but if\r\nstrolling under your Robinias when in full flower, just look at stamens\r\nand pistils whether protruded and whether bees visit them. I must just\r\nmention a fact mentioned to me the other day by Sir W. Macarthur, a\r\nclever Australian gardener: viz., how odd it was that his Erythrinas in\r\nN.S. Wales would not set a seed, without he imitated the movements of\r\nthe petals which bees cause. Well, as long as you live, you will never,\r\nafter this fearfully long note, ask me why I believe this or that.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 586. TO ASA GRAY. June 18th [1857].\r\n\r\nIt has been extremely kind of you telling me about the trees: now with\r\nyour facts, and those from Britain, N. Zealand, and Tasmania I shall\r\nhave fair materials for judging. I am writing this away from home, but\r\nI think your fraction of 95/132 is as large as in other cases, and is at\r\nleast a striking coincidence.\r\n\r\nI thank you much for your remarks about my crossing notions, to which,\r\nI may add, I was led by exactly the same idea as yours, viz., that\r\ncrossing must be one means of eliminating variation, and then I wished\r\nto make out how far in animals and vegetables this was possible.\r\nPapilionaceous flowers are almost dead floorers to me, and I cannot\r\nexperimentise, as castration alone often produces sterility. I am\r\nsurprised at what you say about Compositae and Gramineae. From what I\r\nhave seen of latter they seemed to me (and I have watched wheat,\r\nowing to what L. de Longchamps has said on their fertilisation in bud)\r\nfavourable for crossing; and from Cassini's observations and Kolreuter's\r\non the adhesive pollen, and C.C. Sprengel's, I had concluded that the\r\nCompositae were eminently likely (I am aware of the pistil brushing\r\nout pollen) to be crossed. (586/1. This is an instance of the curious\r\nignorance of the essential principles of floral mechanism which was to\r\nbe found even among learned and accomplished botanists such as Gray,\r\nbefore the publication of the \"Fertilisation of Orchids.\" Even in 1863\r\nwe find Darwin explaining the meaning of dichogamy in a letter to Gray.)\r\nIf in some months' time you can find time to tell me whether you have\r\nmade any observations on the early fertilisation of plants in these two\r\norders, I should be very glad to hear, as it would save me from great\r\nblunder. In several published remarks on this subject in various genera\r\nit has seemed to me that the early fertilisation has been inferred\r\nfrom the early shedding of the pollen, which I think is clearly a false\r\ninference. Another cause, I should think, of the belief of fertilisation\r\nin the bud, is the not-rare, abnormal, early maturity of the pistil as\r\ndescribed by Gartner. I have hitherto failed in meeting with detailed\r\naccounts of regular and normal impregnation in the bud. Podostemon and\r\nSubularia under water (and Leguminosae) seem and are strongest cases\r\nagainst me, as far as I as yet know. I am so sorry that you are so\r\noverwhelmed with work; it makes your VERY GREAT kindness to me the more\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nIt is really pretty to see how effectual insects are. A short time ago\r\nI found a female holly sixty measured yards from any other holly, and\r\nI cut off some twigs and took by chance twenty stigmas, cut off their\r\ntops, and put them under the microscope: there was pollen on every one,\r\nand in profusion on most! weather cloudy and stormy and unfavourable,\r\nwind in wrong direction to have brought any.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 587. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 12th [1858].\r\n\r\nI want to ask a question which will take you only few words to answer.\r\nIt bears on my former belief (and Asa Gray strongly expressed opinion)\r\nthat Papilionaceous flowers were fatal to my notion of there being no\r\neternal hermaphrodites. First let me say how evidence goes. You will\r\nremember my facts going to show that kidney-beans require visits of bees\r\nto be fertilised. This has been positively stated to be the case with\r\nLathyrus grandiflorus, and has been very partially verified by me.\r\nSir W. Macarthur tells me that Erythrina will hardly seed in Australia\r\nwithout the petals are moved as if by bee. I have just met the statement\r\nthat, with common bean, when the humble-bees bite holes at the base\r\nof the flower, and therefore cease visiting the mouth of the corolla,\r\n\"hardly a bean will set.\" But now comes a much more curious statement,\r\nthat [in] 1842-43, \"since bees were established at Wellington (New\r\nZealand), clover seeds all over the settlement, WHICH IT DID NOT\r\nBEFORE.\" (587/1. See Letter 362, Volume I.) The writer evidently has no\r\nidea what the connection can be. Now I cannot help at once connecting\r\nthis statement (and all the foregoing statements in some degree support\r\neach other, as all have been advanced without any sort of theory) with\r\nthe remarkable absence of Papilionaceous plants in N. Zealand. I see in\r\nyour list Clianthus, Carmichaelia (four species), a new genus, a shrub,\r\nand Edwardsia (is latter Papilionaceous?). Now what I want to know is\r\nwhether any of these have flowers as small as clover; for if they\r\nhave large flowers they may be visited by humble-bees, which I think I\r\nremember do exist in New Zealand; and which humble-bees would not visit\r\nthe smaller clover. Even the very minute little yellow clover in England\r\nhas every flower visited and revisited by hive-bees, as I know by\r\nexperience. Would it not be a curious case of correlation if it could be\r\nshown to be probable that herbaceous and small Leguminosae do not exist\r\nbecause when [their] seeds [are] washed ashore (!!!) no small bees exist\r\nthere. Though this latter fact must be ascertained. I may not prove\r\nanything, but does it not seem odd that so many quite independent facts,\r\nor rather statements, should point all in one direction, viz., that bees\r\nare necessary to the fertilisation of Papilionaceous flowers?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 588. TO JOHN LUBBOCK (Lord Avebury). Sunday [1859].\r\n\r\nDo you remember calling my attention to certain flowers in the truss\r\nof Pelargoniums not being true, or not having the dark shade on the two\r\nupper petals? I believe it was Lady Lubbock's observation. I find, as\r\nI expected, it is always the central or sub-central flower; but what is\r\nfar more curious, the nectary, which is blended with the peduncle of\r\nthe flowers, gradually lessens and quite disappears (588/1. This fact\r\nis mentioned in Maxwell Masters' \"Vegetable Teratology\" (Ray Society's\r\nPublications), 1869, page 221.), as the dark shade on the two upper\r\npetals disappears. Compare the stalk in the two enclosed parcels, in\r\neach of which there is a perfect flower.\r\n\r\nNow, if your gardener will not be outrageous, do look over your\r\ngeraniums and send me a few trusses, if you can find any, having the\r\nflowers without the marks, sending me some perfect flowers on same\r\ntruss. The case seems to me rather a pretty one of correlation of\r\ngrowth; for the calyx also becomes slightly modified in the flowers\r\nwithout marks.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 589. TO MAXWELL MASTERS. Down, April 7th [1860].\r\n\r\nI hope that you will excuse the liberty which I take in writing to you\r\nand begging a favour. I have been very much interested by the abstract\r\n(too brief) of your lecture at the Royal Institution. Many of the facts\r\nalluded to are full of interest for me. But on one point I should be\r\ninfinitely obliged if you could procure me any information: namely, with\r\nrespect to sweet-peas. I am a great believer in the natural crossing of\r\nindividuals of the same species. But I have been assured by Mr. Cattell\r\n(589/1. The nurseryman he generally dealt with.), of Westerham, that the\r\nseveral varieties of sweet-pea can be raised close together for a number\r\nof years without intercrossing. But on the other hand he stated that\r\nthey go over the beds, and pull up any false plant, which they very\r\nnaturally attribute to wrong seeds getting mixed in the lot. After many\r\nfailures, I succeeded in artificially crossing two varieties, and the\r\noffspring out of the same pod, instead of being intermediate, was very\r\nnearly like the two pure parents; yet in one, there was a trace of the\r\ncross, and these crossed peas in the next generation showed still more\r\nplainly their mongrel origin. Now, what I want to know is, whether there\r\nis much variation in sweet-peas which might be owing to natural crosses.\r\nWhat I should expect would be that they would keep true for many years,\r\nbut that occasionally, perhaps at long intervals, there would be a\r\nconsiderable amount of crossing of the varieties grown close together.\r\nCan you give, or obtain from your father, any information on this head,\r\nand allow me to quote your authority? It would really be a very great\r\nfavour and kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 590. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(590/1. The genera Scaevola and Leschenaultia, to which the following\r\nletter refers, belong to the Goodeniaceae (Goodenovieae, Bentham &\r\nHooker), an order allied to the Lobeliaceae, although the mechanism\r\nof fertilisation resembles rather more nearly that of Campanula. The\r\ncharacteristic feature of the flower in this order is the indusium, or,\r\nas Delpino (590/2. Delpino's observations on Dichogamy, summarised by\r\nHildebrand in \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1870, page 634.) calls it, the \"collecting\r\ncup\": this cuplike organ is a development of the style, and serves the\r\nsame function as the hairs on the style of Campanula, namely, that of\r\ntaking the pollen from the anthers and presenting it to the visiting\r\ninsect. During this stage the immature stigma is at the bottom of the\r\ncup, and though surrounded by pollen is incapable of being pollinated.\r\nIn most genera of the order the pollen is pushed out of the indusium by\r\nthe growth of the style or stigma, very much as occurs in Lobelia or\r\nthe Compositae. Finally the style emerges from the indusium (590/3.\r\nAccording to Hamilton (\"Proc. Linn. Soc. N. S. Wales,\" X., 1895, page\r\n361) the stigma rarely grows beyond the indusium in Dampiera. In the\r\nsame journal (1885-6, page 157, and IX., 1894, page 201) Hamilton\r\nhas given a number of interesting observations on Goodenia, Scaevola,\r\nSelliera, Brunonia. There seem to be mechanisms for cross- and also\r\nfor self-fertilisation.), the stigmas open out and are pollinated from\r\nyounger flowers. The mechanism of fertilisation has been described by\r\nF. Muller (590/4. In a letter to Hildebrand published in the \"Bot.\r\nZeitung,\" 1868, page 113.), and more completely by Delpino (loc. cit.).\r\n\r\nMr. Bentham wrote a paper (590/5. \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" 1869, page 203.)\r\non the style and stigma in the Goodenovieae, where he speaks of Mr.\r\nDarwin's belief that fertilisation takes place outside the indusium.\r\nThis statement, which we imagine Mr. Bentham must have had from an\r\nunpublished source, was incomprehensible to him as long as he confined\r\nhis work to such genera as Goodenia, Scaevola, Velleia, Coelogyne,\r\nin which the mechanism is much as above described; but on examining\r\nLeschenaultia the meaning became clear. Bentham writes of this\r\ngenus:--\"The indusium is usually described as broadly two-lipped,\r\nwithout any distinct stigma. The fact appears to be that the upper less\r\nprominent lip is stigmatic all over, inside and out, with a transverse\r\nband of short glandular hairs at its base outside, while the lower more\r\nprominent lip is smooth and glabrous, or with a tuft of rigid hairs.\r\nPerhaps this lower lip and the upper band of hairs are all that\r\ncorrespond to the indusium of other genera; and the so-called upper lip,\r\noutside of which impregnation may well take place, as observed by Mr.\r\nDarwin, must be regarded as the true stigma.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin's interest in the Goodeniaceae was due to the mechanism being\r\napparently fitted for self-fertilisation. In 1871 a writer signing\r\nhimself F.W.B. made a communication to the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\"\r\n(590/6. 1871, page 1103.), in which he expresses himself as \"agreeably\r\nsurprised\" to find Leschenaultia adapted for self-fertilisation, or at\r\nleast for self-pollinisation. This led Darwin to publish a short note in\r\nthe same journal, in which he describes the penetration of pollen-tubes\r\ninto the viscid surface on the outside of the indusium. (590/7. 1871,\r\npage 1166. He had previously written in the \"Journal of Horticulture and\r\nCottage Gardener,\" May 28th, 1861, page 151:--\"Leschenaultia formosa has\r\napparently the most effective contrivance to prevent the stigma of one\r\nflower ever receiving a grain of pollen from another flower; for the\r\npollen is shed in the early bud, and is there shut up round the stigma\r\nwithin a cup or indusium. But some observations led me to suspect that\r\nnevertheless insect agency here comes into play; for I found by holding\r\na camel-hair pencil parallel to the pistil, and moving it as if it were\r\na bee going to suck the nectar, the straggling hairs of the brush opened\r\nthe lip of the indusium, entered it, stirred up the pollen, and brought\r\nout some grains. I did this to five flowers, and marked them. These\r\nfive flowers all set pods; whereas only two other pods set on the whole\r\nplant, though covered with innumerable flowers...I wrote to Mr. James\r\nDrummond, at Swan River in Australia,...and he soon wrote to me that he\r\nhad seen a bee cleverly opening the indusium and extracting pollen.\")\r\nHe also describes how a brush, pushed into the flower in imitation of\r\nan insect, presses \"against the slightly projecting lower lip of the\r\nindusium, opens it, and some of the hairs enter and become smeared\r\nwith pollen.\" The yield of pollen is therefore differently arranged in\r\nLeschenaultia; for in the more typical genera it depends on the growth\r\nof the style inside the indusium. Delpino, however (see Hildebrand's\r\nversion, loc. cit.), describes a similar opening of the cup produced by\r\npressure on the hairs in some genera of the order.)\r\n\r\nDown, June 7th [1860].\r\n\r\nBest and most beloved of men, I supplicate and entreat you to observe\r\none point for me. Remember that the Goodeniaceae have weighed like an\r\nincubus for years on my soul. It relates to Scaevola microcarpa. I\r\nfind that in bud the indusium collects all the pollen splendidly, but,\r\ndifferently from Leschenaultia, cannot be afterwards easily opened.\r\nFurther, I find that at an early stage, when the flower first opens, a\r\nboat-shaped stigma lies at the bottom of the indusium, and further\r\nthat this stigma, after the flower has some time expanded, grows very\r\nrapidly, when the plant is kept hot, and pushes out of the indusium a\r\nmass of pollen; and at same time two horns project at the corners of the\r\nindusium. Now the appearance of these horns makes me suppose that these\r\nare the stigmatic surfaces. Will you look to this? for if they be by the\r\nrelative position of the parts (with indusium and stigma bent at right\r\nangles to style) [I am led to think] that an insect entering a flower\r\ncould not fail to have [its] whole back (at the period when, as I have\r\nseen, a whole mass of pollen is pushed out) covered with pollen, which\r\nwould almost certainly get rubbed on the two horns. Indeed, I doubt\r\nwhether, without this aid, pollen would get on to the horns. What\r\ninterests me in the case is the analogy in result with the Lobelia, but\r\nby very different means. In Lobelia the stigma, before it is mature,\r\npushes by its circular brush of hairs the pollen out of the conjoined\r\nanthers; here the indusium collects pollen, and then the growth of the\r\nstigma pushes it out. In the course of about 1 1/2 hour, I found an\r\nindusium with hairs on the outer edge perfectly clogged with pollen, and\r\nhorns protruded, which before the 1 1/2 hour had not one grain of pollen\r\noutside the indusium, and no trace of protruding horns. So you will see\r\nhow I wish to know whether the horns are the true stigmatic surfaces. I\r\nwould try the case experimentally by putting pollen on the horns, but my\r\ngreenhouse is so cold, and my plant so small, and in such a little pot,\r\nthat I suppose it would not seed...\r\n\r\nThe little length of stigmatic horns at the moment when pollen is forced\r\nout of the indusium, compared to what they ultimately attain, makes me\r\nfancy that they are not then mature or ready, and if so, as in Lobelia,\r\neach flower must be fertilised by pollen from another and earlier\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nHow curious that the indusium should first so cleverly collect pollen\r\nand then afterwards push it out! Yet how closely analogous to Campanula\r\nbrushing pollen out of the anther and retaining it on hairs till the\r\nstigma is ready. I am going to try whether Campanula sets seed without\r\ninsect agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 591. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(591/1. The following letters are given here rather than in\r\nchronological order, as bearing on the Leschenaultia problem. The latter\r\npart of Letter 591 refers to the cleistogamic flowers of Viola.)\r\n\r\nDown, May 1st [1862].\r\n\r\nIf you can screw out time, do look at the stigma of the blue\r\nLeschenaultia biloba. I have just examined a large bud with the indusium\r\nnot yet closed, and it seems to me certain that there is no stigma\r\nwithin. The case would be very important for me, and I do not like to\r\ntrust solely to myself. I have been impregnating flowers, but it is\r\nrather difficult...\r\n\r\nI have just looked again at Viola canina. The case is odder: only 2\r\nstamens which embrace the stigma have pollen; the 3 other stamens have\r\nno anther-cells and no pollen. These 2 fertile anthers are of different\r\nshape from the 3 sterile others, and the scale representing the\r\nlower lip is larger and differently shaped from the 4 other scales\r\nrepresenting 4 other petals.\r\n\r\nIn V. odorata (single flower) all five stamens produce pollen. But I\r\ndaresay all this is known.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 592. TO J.D. HOOKER. November 3rd [1862].\r\n\r\nDo you remember the scarlet Leschenaultia formosa with the sticky margin\r\noutside the indusium? Well, this is the stigma--at least, I find the\r\npollen-tubes here penetrate and nowhere else. What a joke it would be if\r\nthe stigma is always exterior, and this by far the greatest difficulty\r\nin my crossing notions should turn out a case eminently requiring insect\r\naid, and consequently almost inevitably ensuring crossing. By the\r\nway, have you any other Goodeniaceae which you could lend me, besides\r\nLeschenaultia and Scaevola, of which I have seen enough?\r\n\r\nI had a long letter the other day from Crocker of Chichester; he has the\r\nreal spirit of an experimentalist, but has not done much this summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 593. TO F. MULLER. Down, April 9th and 15th [1866].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged by your letter of February 13th, abounding with\r\nso many highly interesting facts. Your account of the Rubiaceous plant\r\nis one of the most extraordinary that I have ever read, and I am glad\r\nyou are going to publish it. I have long wished some one to observe the\r\nfertilisation of Scaevola, and you must permit me to tell you what I\r\nhave observed. First, for the allied genus of Leschenaultia: utterly\r\ndisbelieving that it fertilises itself, I introduced a camel-hair brush\r\ninto the flower in the same way as a bee would enter, and I found that\r\nthe flowers were thus fertilised, which never otherwise happens; I then\r\nsearched for the stigma, and found it outside the indusium with the\r\npollen-tubes penetrating it; and I convinced Dr. Hooker that botanists\r\nwere quite wrong in supposing that the stigma lay inside the indusium.\r\nIn Scaevola microcarpa the structure is very different, for the immature\r\nstigma lies at the base within the indusium, and as the stigma grows it\r\npushes the pollen out of the indusium, and it then clings to the hairs\r\nwhich fringe the tips of the indusium; and when an insect enters the\r\nflower, the pollen (as I have seen) is swept from these long hairs on to\r\nthe insect's back. The stigma continues to grow, but is not apparently\r\nready for impregnation until it is developed into two long protruding\r\nhorns, at which period all the pollen has been pushed out of the\r\nindusium. But my observations are here at fault, for I did not observe\r\nthe penetration of the pollen-tubes. The case is almost parallel with\r\nthat of Lobelia. Now, I hope you will get two plants of Scaevola, and\r\nprotect one from insects, leaving the other uncovered, and observe the\r\nresults, both in the number of capsules produced, and in the average\r\nnumber of seeds in each. It would be well to fertilise half a dozen\r\nflowers under the net, to prove that the cover is not injurious to\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your case of Aristolochia, I think further observation\r\nwould convince you that it is not fertilised only by larvae, for in a\r\nnearly parallel case of an Arum and a Aristolochia, I found that insects\r\nflew from flower to flower. I would suggest to you to observe any cases\r\nof flowers which catch insects by their probosces, as occurs with\r\nsome of the Apocyneae (593/1. Probably Asclepiadeae. See H. Muller,\r\n\"Fertilisation of Flowers,\" page 396.); I have never been able to\r\nconceive for what purpose (if any) this is effected; at the same time,\r\nif I tempt you to neglect your zoological work for these miscellaneous\r\nobservations I shall be guilty of a great crime.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to the indusium: how curious it is that the\r\npollen should be thus collected in a special receptacle, afterwards to\r\nbe swept out by insects' agency!\r\n\r\nI am surprised at what you tell me about the fewness of the flowers of\r\nyour native orchids which produce seed-capsules. What a contrast with\r\nour temperate European species, with the exception of some species of\r\nOphrys!--I now know of three or four cases of self-fertilising orchids,\r\nbut all these are provided with means for an occasional cross.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say Dr. Cruger is dead from a fever.\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your paper in the \"Botanische Zeitung\" on the wood\r\nof climbing plants. (593/2. Fritz Muller, \"Ueber das Holz einiger um\r\nDesterro wachsenden Kletterpflanzen.\" \"Botanische Zeitung,\" 1866, pages\r\n57, 65.) I have read as yet only your very interesting and curious\r\nremarks on the subject as bearing on the change of species; you have\r\npleased me by the very high compliments which you pay to my paper. I\r\nhave been at work since March 1st on a new English edition (593/3. The\r\n4th Edition.) of my \"Origin,\" of which when published I will send you a\r\ncopy. I have much regretted the time it has cost me, as it has stopped\r\nmy other work. On the other hand, it will be useful for a new third\r\nGerman edition, which is now wanted. I have corrected it largely, and\r\nadded some discussions, but not nearly so much as I wished to do, for,\r\nbeing able to work only two hours daily, I feared I should never get it\r\nfinished. I have taken some facts and views from your work \"Fur Darwin\";\r\nbut not one quarter of what I should like to have quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 594. TO A.G. MORE. Down, June 24th, 1860.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will forgive the liberty which I take in writing to you\r\nand requesting a favour. Mr. H.C. Watson has given me your address, and\r\nhas told me that he thought that you would be willing to oblige me. Will\r\nyou please to read the enclosed, and then you will understand what I\r\nwish observed with respect to the bee-orchis. (594/1. Ophrys apifera.)\r\nWhat I especially wish, from information which I have received since\r\npublishing the enclosed, is that the state of the pollen-masses should\r\nbe noted in flowers just beginning to wither, in a district where the\r\nbee-orchis is extremely common. I have been assured that in parts of\r\nIsle of Wight, viz., Freshwater Gate, numbers occur almost crowded\r\ntogether: whether anything of this kind occurs in your vicinity I know\r\nnot; but, if in your power, I should be infinitely obliged for any\r\ninformation. As I am writing, I will venture to mention another wish\r\nwhich I have: namely, to examine fresh flowers and buds of the Aceras,\r\nSpiranthes, marsh Epipactis, and any other rare orchis. The point which\r\nI wish to examine is really very curious, but it would take too long\r\nspace to explain. Could you oblige me by taking the great trouble to\r\nsend me in an old tin canister any of these orchids, permitting me, of\r\ncourse, to repay postage? It would be a great kindness, but perhaps I am\r\nunreasonable to make such a request. If you will inform me whether you\r\nhave leisure so far to oblige me, I would tell you my movements, for on\r\naccount of my own health and that of my daughter, I shall be on the move\r\nfor the next two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nI am sure I have much cause to apologise for the liberty which I have\r\ntaken...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 595. TO A.G. MORE. Down, August 3rd, 1860.\r\n\r\nI thank you most sincerely for sending me the Epipactis [palustris]. You\r\ncan hardly imagine what an interesting morning's work you have given me,\r\nas the rostellum exhibited a quite new modification of structure. It has\r\nbeen extremely kind of you to take so very much trouble for me. Have you\r\nlooked at the pollen-masses of the bee-Ophrys? I do not know whether the\r\nEpipactis grows near to your house: if it does, and any object takes you\r\nto the place (pray do not for a moment think me so very unreasonable\r\nas to ask you to go on purpose), would you be so kind [as] to watch\r\nthe flowers for a quarter of an hour, and mark whether any insects (and\r\nwhat?) visit these flowers.\r\n\r\nI should suppose they would crawl in by depressing the terminal portion\r\nof the labellum; and that when within the flower this terminal portion\r\nwould resume its former position; and lastly, that the insect in\r\ncrawling out would not depress the labellum, but would crawl out at back\r\nof flower. (595/1. The observations of Mr. William Darwin on Epipactis\r\npalustris given in the \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., 1877,\r\npage 99, bear on this point. The chief fertilisers are hive-bees, which\r\nare too big to crawl into the flower. They cling to the labellum, and\r\nby depressing it open up the entrance to the flower. Owing to the\r\nelasticity of the labellum and its consequent tendency to spring up\r\nwhen released, the bees, \"as they left the flower, seemed to fly rather\r\nupwards.\" This agrees with Darwin's conception of the mechanism of the\r\nflower as given in the first edition of the Orchid book, 1862, page 100,\r\nalthough at that time he imagined that the fertilising insect crawled\r\ninto the flower. The extreme flexibility and elasticity of the labellum\r\nwas first observed by Mr. More (see first edition, page 99). The\r\ndescription of the flower given in the above letter to Mr. More is not\r\nquite clear; the reader is referred to the \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\"\r\nloc. cit.) An insect crawling out of a recently opened flower would,\r\nI believe, have parts of the pollen-masses adhering to the back or\r\nshoulder. I have seen this in Listera. How I should like to watch the\r\nEpipactis.\r\n\r\nIf you can it any time send me Spiranthes or Aceras or O. ustulata, you\r\nwould complete your work of kindness.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If you should visit the Epipactis again, would you gather a few of\r\nthe lower flowers which have been opened for some time and have begun\r\nto wither a little, and observe whether pollen is well cleared out of\r\nanther-case. I have been struck with surprise that in nearly all the\r\nlower flowers sent by you, though much of the pollen has been removed,\r\nyet a good deal of pollen is left wasted within the anthers. I observed\r\nsomething of this kind in Cephalanthera grandiflora. But I fear that you\r\nwill think me an intolerable bore.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 596. TO A.G. MORE. Down, August 5th, 1860.\r\n\r\nI am infinitely obliged for your most clearly stated observations on\r\nthe bee-orchis. It is now perfectly clear that something removes the\r\npollen-masses far more with you than in this neighbourhood. But I am\r\nutterly puzzled about the foot-stalk being so often cut through. I\r\nshould suspect snails. I yesterday found thirty-nine flowers, and of\r\nthem only one pollen-mass in three flowers had been removed, and as\r\nthese were extremely much-withered flowers I am not quite sure of\r\nthe truth of this. The wind again is a new element of doubt. Your\r\nobservations will aid me extremely in coming to some conclusion. (596/1.\r\nMr. More's observations on the percentage of flowers in which the\r\npollinia were absent are quoted in \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition\r\nI., page 68.) I hope in a day or two to receive some day-moths, on the\r\nprobosces of which I am assured the pollen-masses of the bee-orchis\r\nstill adhere (596/2. He was doomed to disappointment. On July 17th,\r\n1861, he wrote to Mr. More:--\"I found the other day a lot of bee-Ophrys\r\nwith the glands of the pollinia all in their pouches. All facts point\r\nclearly to eternal self-fertilisation in this species; yet I cannot\r\nswallow the bitter pill. Have you looked at any this year?\")...\r\n\r\nI wrote yesterday to thank you for the Epipactis. For the chance of your\r\nliking to look at what I have found: take a recently opened flower, drag\r\ngently up the stigmatic surface almost any object (the side of a hooked\r\nneedle), and you will find the cap of the hemispherical rostellum comes\r\noff with a touch, and being viscid on under-surface, clings to needle,\r\nand as pollen-masses are already attached to the back of rostellum, the\r\nneedle drags out much pollen. But to do this, the curiously projecting\r\nand fleshy summits of anther-cases must at some time be pushed back\r\nslightly. Now when an insect's head gets into the flower, when the flap\r\nof the labellum has closed by its elasticity, the insect would naturally\r\ncreep out by the back-side of the flower. And mark when the insect flies\r\nto another flower with the pollen-masses adhering to it, if the flap of\r\nlabellum did not easily open and allow free ingress to the insect, it\r\nwould surely rub off the pollen on the upper petals, and so not leave\r\nit on stigma. It is to know whether I have rightly interpreted the\r\nstructure of this whole flower that I am so curious to see how insects\r\nact. Small insects, I daresay, would crawl in and out and do nothing. I\r\nhope that I shall not have wearied you with these details.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to see a pretty and curious little sight, look\r\nto Orchis pyramidalis, and you will see that the sticky glands are\r\ncongenitally united into a saddle-shaped organ. Remove this under\r\nmicroscope by pincers applied to foot-stalk of pollen-mass, and look\r\nquickly at the spontaneous movement of the saddle-shaped organs and see\r\nhow beautifully adapted to seize proboscis of moth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 597. TO J.D. HOOKER December 4th [1860].\r\n\r\nMany thanks about Apocynum and Meyen.\r\n\r\nThe latter I want about some strange movements in cells of Drosera,\r\nwhich Meyen alone seems to have observed. (597/1. No observations of\r\nMeyen are mentioned in \"Insectivorous Plants.\") It is very curious, but\r\nTrecul disbelieves that Drosera really clasps flies! I should very much\r\nwish to talk over Drosera with you. I did chloroform it, and the leaves\r\nwhich were already expanded did not recover thirty seconds of exposure\r\nfor three days. I used the expression weight for the bit of hair which\r\ncaused movement and weighed 1/78000 of a grain; but I do not believe it\r\nis weight, and what it is, I cannot after many experiments conjecture.\r\n(597/2. The doubt here expressed as to whether the result is due to\r\nactual weight is interesting in connection with Pfeffer's remarkable\r\ndiscovery that a smooth object in contact with the gland produces no\r\neffect if the plant is protected from all vibration; on an ordinary\r\ntable the slight shaking which reaches the plant is sufficient to make\r\nthe body resting on the gland tremble, and thus produce a series of\r\nvarying pressures--under these circumstances the gland is irritated, and\r\nthe tentacle moves. See Pfeffer, \"Untersuchungen aus d. bot. Institut\r\nzu Tubingen,\" Volume I., 1885, page 483; also \"Insectivorous Plants,\"\r\nEdition II., page 22.) The movement in this case does not depend on\r\nthe chemical nature of substance. Latterly I have tried experiments on\r\nsingle glands, and a microscopical atom of raw meat causes such rapid\r\nmovement that I could see it move like hand of clock. In this case it\r\nis the nature of the object. It is wonderful the rapidity of the\r\nabsorption: in ten seconds weak solution of carbonate of ammonia changes\r\nnot the colour, but the state of contents within the glands. In two\r\nminutes thirty seconds juice of meat has been absorbed by gland and\r\npassed from cell to cell all down the pedicel (or hair) of the gland,\r\nand caused the sap to pass from the cells on the upper side of the\r\npedicel to the lower side, and this causes the curvature of the pedicel.\r\nI shall work away next summer when Drosera opens again, for I am much\r\ninterested in subject. After the glandular hairs have curved, the oddest\r\nchanges take place--viz., a segregation of the homogeneous pink fluid\r\nand necessary slow movements in the thicker matter. By Jove, I sometimes\r\nthink Drosera is a disguised animal! You know that I always so like\r\ntelling you what I do, that you must forgive me scribbling on my beloved\r\nDrosera. Farewell. I am so very glad that you are going to reform your\r\nways; I am sure that you would have injured your health seriously. There\r\nis poor Dana has done actually nothing--cannot even write a letter--for\r\na year, and it is hoped that in another YEAR he may quite recover.\r\n\r\nAfter this homily, good night, my dear friend. Good heavens, I ought\r\nnot to scold you, but thank you, for writing so long and interesting a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 598. TO E. CRESY. Down, December 12th [1860?].\r\n\r\nAfter writing out the greater part of my paper on Drosera, I thought of\r\nso many points to try, and I wished to re-test the basis of one large\r\nset of experiments, namely, to feel still more sure than I am, that a\r\ndrop of plain water never produces any effect, that I have resolved\r\nto publish nothing this year. For I found in the record of my daily\r\nexperiments one suspicious case. I must wait till next summer. It will\r\nbe difficult to try any solid substances containing nitrogen, such\r\nas ivory; for two quite distinct causes excite the movement, namely,\r\nmechanical irritation and presence of nitrogen. When a solid substance\r\nis placed on leaf it becomes clasped, but is released sooner than when a\r\nnitrogenous solid is clasped; yet it is difficult (except with raw meat\r\nand flies) to be sure of the result, owing to differences in vigour of\r\ndifferent plants. The last experiments which I tried before my\r\nplants became too languid are very curious, and were tried by putting\r\nmicroscopical atoms on the gland itself of single hairs; and it is\r\nperfectly evident that an atom of human hair, 1/76000 of a grain (as\r\nascertained by weighing a length of hair) in weight, causes conspicuous\r\nmovement. I do not believe (for atoms of cotton thread acted) it is the\r\nchemical nature; and some reasons make me doubt whether it is\r\nactual weight; it is not the shadow; and I am at present, after many\r\nexperiments, confounded to know what the cause is. That these atoms did\r\nreally act and alter the state of the contents of all the cells in the\r\nglandular hair, which moved, was perfectly clear. But I hope next summer\r\nto make out a good deal more...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 599. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 14th [1861].\r\n\r\nI have been putting off writing from day to day, as I did not wish to\r\ntrouble you, till my wish for a little news will not let me rest...\r\n\r\nI have no news to tell you, for I have had no interesting letters for\r\nsome time, and have not seen a soul. I have been going through the\r\n\"Cottage Gardener\" of last year, on account chiefly of Beaton's articles\r\n(599/1. Beaton was a regular contributor to the \"Cottage Gardener,\" and\r\nwrote various articles on cross breeding, etc., in 1861. One of these\r\nwas in reply to a letter published in the \"Cottage Gardener,\" May\r\n14th, 1861, page 112, in which Darwin asked for information as to the\r\nCompositae and the hollyhock being crossed by insect visitors. In the\r\nnumber for June 8th, 1861, page 211, Darwin wrote on the variability of\r\nthe central flower of the carrot and the peloria of the central flower\r\nin Pelargonium. An extract from a letter by Darwin on Leschenaultia,\r\n\"Cottage Gardener,\" May 28th, 1861, page 151, is given in Letter 590,\r\nnote.); he strikes me as a clever but d--d cock-sure man (as Lord\r\nMelbourne said), and I have some doubts whether to be much trusted. I\r\nsuspect he has never recorded his experiment at the time with care. He\r\nhas made me indignant by the way he speaks of Gartner, evidently\r\nknowing nothing of his work. I mean to try and pump him in the\r\n\"Cottage Gardener,\" and shall perhaps defend Gartner. He alludes to me\r\noccasionally, and I cannot tell with what spirit. He speaks of \"this Mr.\r\nDarwin\" in one place as if I were a very noxious animal.\r\n\r\nLet me have a line about poor Henslow pretty soon.\r\n\r\n(599/2. In a letter of May 18th, 1861, Darwin wrote again:--)\r\n\r\nBy the way, thanks about Beaton. I have now read more of his writings,\r\nand one answer to me in \"Cottage Gardener.\" I can plainly see that he is\r\nnot to be trusted. He does not well know his own subject of crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 600. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(600/1. Part of this letter has been published in \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nIII., page 265.)\r\n\r\n2, Hesketh Crescent, Torquay [1861].\r\n\r\n...The beauty of the adaptation of parts seems to me unparalleled. I\r\nshould think or guess [that] waxy pollen was most differentiated. In\r\nCypripedium, which seems least modified, and a much exterminated group,\r\nthe grains are single. In all others, as far as I have seen, they are in\r\npackets of four; and these packets cohere into many wedge-formed masses\r\nin Orchis, into eight, four, and finally two. It seems curious that\r\na flower should exist which could, at most, fertilise only two other\r\nflowers, seeing how abundant pollen generally is; this fact I look at\r\nas explaining the perfection of the contrivance by which the pollen,\r\nso important from its fewness, is carried from flower to flower. By the\r\nway, Cephalanthera has single pollen-grains, but this seems to be a case\r\nof degradation, for the rostellum is utterly aborted. Oddly, the\r\ncolumns of pollen are here kept in place by very early penetration of\r\npollen-tubes into the edge of the stigma; nevertheless, it receives more\r\npollen by insect agency. Epithecia [Dichaea] has done me one good little\r\nturn. I often speculated how the caudicle of Orchis had been formed.\r\n(600/2. The gradation here suggested is thoroughly worked out in the\r\n\"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition I., page 323, Edition II., page\r\n257.) I had noticed slight clouds in the substance half way down; I\r\nhave now dissected them out, and I find they are pollen-grains fairly\r\nembedded and useless. If you suppose the pollen-grains to abort in\r\nthe lower half of the pollinia of Epipactis, but the parallel elastic\r\nthreads to remain and cohere, you have the caudicle of Orchis, and can\r\nunderstand the few embedded and functionless pollen-grains. I must not\r\nlook at any more exotic orchids: hearty thanks for your offer. But if\r\nyou would make one single observation for me on Cypripedium, I should\r\nbe glad. Asa Gray writes to me that the outside of the pollen-masses\r\nis sticky in this genus; I find that the whole mass consists of\r\npollen-grains immersed in a sticky brownish thick fluid. You could tell\r\nby a mere lens and penknife. If it is, as I find it, pollen could not\r\nget on the stigma without insect aid. Cypripedium confounds me much.\r\nI conjecture that drops of nectar are secreted by the surface of the\r\nlabellum beneath the anthers and in front of the stigma, and that the\r\nshield over the anthers and the form of labellum is to compel insects\r\nto insert their proboscis all round both organs. (600/3. This view was\r\nafterwards given up.) It would be troublesome for you to look at this,\r\nas it is always bothersome to catch the nectar secreting, and the cup of\r\nthe labellum gets filled with water by gardener's watering.\r\n\r\nI have examined Listera ovata, cordata, and Neottia nidus avis: the\r\npollen is uniform; I suspect you must have seen some observation founded\r\non a mistake from the penetration and hardening of sticky fluid from the\r\nrostellum, which does penetrate the pollen a little.\r\n\r\nIt is mere virtue which makes me not wish to examine more orchids; for\r\nI like it far better than writing about varieties of cocks and hens and\r\nducks. Nevertheless, I have just been looking at Lindley's list in\r\nthe \"Vegetable Kingdom,\" and I cannot resist one or two of his great\r\ndivision of Arethuseae, which includes Vanilla. And as I know so well\r\nthe Ophreae, I should like (God forgive me) any one of the Satyriadae,\r\nDisidae and Corycidae.\r\n\r\nI fear my long lucubrations will have wearied you, but it has amused me\r\nto write, so forgive me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 601. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(601/1. Part of the following letter is published in the \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" the remainder, with the omission of part bearing on the\r\nGlen Roy problem, is now given as an example of the varied botanical\r\nassistance Darwin received from Sir Joseph Hooker. For the part relating\r\nto Verbascum see the \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" Edition II.,\r\n1875, Volume II., page 83. The point is that the white and yellow\r\nflowered plants which occur in two species of Verbascum are undoubted\r\nvarieties, yet \"the sterility which results from the crossing of the\r\ndifferently coloured varieties of the same species is fully as great as\r\nthat which occurs in many cases when distinct species are crossed.\"\r\n\r\nThe sterility of the long-styled form (B) of Linum grandiflorum, with\r\nits own pollen is described in \"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page 87:\r\nhis conclusions on the short-styled form (A) differ from those in the\r\npresent letter.)\r\n\r\nSeptember 28th [1861].\r\n\r\nI am going to beg for help, and I will explain why I want it.\r\n\r\nYou offer Cypripedium; I should be very glad of a specimen, and of any\r\ngood-sized Vandeae, or indeed any orchids, for this reason: I never\r\nthought of publishing separately, and therefore did not keep specimens\r\nin spirits, and now I should be very glad of a few woodcuts to\r\nillustrate my few remarks on exotic orchids. If you can send me any,\r\nsend them by post in a tin canister on middle of day of Saturday,\r\nOctober 5th, for Sowerby will be here.\r\n\r\nSecondly: Have you any white and yellow varieties of Verbascum which\r\nyou could give me, or propagate for me, or LEND me for a year? I have\r\nresolved to try Gartner's wonderful and repeated statement, that pollen\r\nof white and yellow varieties, whether used on the varieties or on\r\nDISTINCT species, has different potency. I do not think any experiment\r\ncan be more important on the origin of species; for if he is correct we\r\ncertainly have what Huxley calls new physiological species arising. I\r\nshould require several species of Verbascum besides the white and yellow\r\nvarieties of the same species. It will be tiresome work, but if I can\r\nanyhow get the plants, it shall be tried.\r\n\r\nThirdly: Can you give me seeds of any Rubiaceae of the sub-order\r\nCinchoneae, as Spermacoce, Diodia, Mitchella, Oldenlandia? Asa Gray says\r\nthey present two forms like Primula. I am sure that this subject is\r\nwell worth working out. I have just almost proved a very curious case\r\nin Linum grandiflorum which presents two forms, A and B. Pollen of A is\r\nperfectly fertile on stigma of A. But pollen of B is absolutely barren\r\non its own stigma; you might as well put so much flour on it. It\r\nastounded me to see the stigmas of B purple with its own pollen; and\r\nthen put a few grains of similar-looking pollen of A on them, and the\r\ngermen immediately and always swelled; those not thus treated never\r\nswelling.\r\n\r\nFourthly: Can you give me any very hairy Saxifraga (for their functions)\r\n[i.e. the functions of the hairs]?\r\n\r\nI send you a resume of my requests, to save you trouble. Nor would I ask\r\nfor so much aid if I did not think all these points well worth trying to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nMy dear old friend, a letter from you always does me a world of good.\r\nAnd, the Lord have mercy on me, what a return I make.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 602. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 4th [1861].\r\n\r\nWill you have the kindness to read the enclosed, and look at the\r\ndiagram. Six words will answer my question. It is not an important\r\npoint, but there is to me an irresistible charm in trying to make out\r\nhomologies. (602/1. In 1880 he wrote to Mr. Bentham: \"It was very kind\r\nof you to write to me about the Orchideae, for it has pleased me to an\r\nextreme degree that I could have been of the least use to you about the\r\nnature of the parts.\"--\"Life and Letters,\" III., page 264.) You know\r\nthe membranous cup or clinandrum, in many orchids, behind the stigma and\r\nrostellum: it is formed of a membrane which unites the filament of the\r\nnormal dorsal anther with the edges of the pistil. The clinandrum is\r\nlargely developed in Malaxis, and is of considerable importance in\r\nretaining the pollinia, which as soon as the flower opens are quite\r\nloose.\r\n\r\nThe appearance and similarity of the tissues, etc., at once gives\r\nsuspicion that the lateral membranes of the clinandrum are the two other\r\nand rudimentary anthers, which in Orchis and Cephalanthera, etc., exist\r\nas mere papillae, here developed and utilised.\r\n\r\nNow for my question. Exactly in the middle of the filament of the\r\nnormal anther, and exactly in the middle of the lateral membrane of the\r\nclinandrum, and running up to the same height, are quite similar bundles\r\nof spiral vessels; ending upwards almost suddenly. Now is not this\r\nstructure a good argument that I interpret the homologies of the sides\r\nof clinandrum rightly? (602/2. Though Robert Brown made use of the\r\nspiral vessels of orchids, yet according to Eichler, \"Bluthendiagramme,\"\r\n1875, Volume I., page 184, Darwin was the first to make substantial\r\nadditions to the conclusions deducible from the course of the vessels in\r\nrelation to the problem of the morphology of these plants. Eichler\r\ngives Darwin's diagram side by side with that of Van Tieghem without\r\nattempting to decide between the differences in detail by which they are\r\ncharacterised.)\r\n\r\nI find that the great Bauer does not draw very correctly! (602/3. F.\r\nBauer, whom Pritzel calls \"der grosste Pflanzenmaler.\" The reference is\r\nto his \"Illustrations of Orchidaceous Plants, with Notes and Prefatory\r\nRemarks by John Lindley,\" London, 1830-38, Folio. See \"Fertilisation\r\nof Orchids,\" Edition II., page 82.) And, good Heavens, what a jumble he\r\nmakes on functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 603. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 22nd. [1861].\r\n\r\nAcropera is a beast,--stigma does not open, everything seems contrived\r\nthat it shall NOT be anyhow fertilised. There is something very odd\r\nabout it, which could only be made out by incessant watching on several\r\nindividual plants.\r\n\r\nI never saw the very curious flower of Canna; I should say the pollen\r\nwas deposited where it is to prevent inevitable self-fertilisation.\r\nYou have no time to try the smallest experiment, else it would be worth\r\nwhile to put pollen on some stigmas (supposing that it does not seed\r\nfreely with you). Anyhow, insects would probably carry pollen from\r\nflower to flower, for Kurr states the tube formed by pistil, stamen and\r\n\"nectarblatt\" secretes (I presume internally) much nectar. Thanks for\r\nsending me the curious flower.\r\n\r\nNow I want much some wisdom; though I must write at considerable length,\r\nyour answer may be very brief.\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 8.--FLORAL DIAGRAM OF AN ORCHID. The \"missing bundle\" could not\r\nbe found in some species.)\r\n\r\nIn R. Brown's admirable paper in the \"Linnean Transacts.\" (603/4. Volume\r\nXVI., page 685.) he suggests (and Lindley cautiously agrees) that the\r\nflower of orchids consists of five whorls, the inner whorl of the two\r\nwhorls of anthers being all rudimentary, and when the labellum presents\r\nridges, two or three of the anthers of both whorls [are] combined with\r\nit. In the ovarium there are six bundles of vessels: R. Brown judged by\r\ntransverse sections. It occurred to me, after what you said, to trace\r\nthe vessels longitudinally, and I have succeeded well. Look at my\r\ndiagram [Figure 8] (which please return, for I am transported with\r\nadmiration at it), which shows the vessels which I have traced, one\r\nbundle to each of fifteen theoretical organs, and no more. You will see\r\nthe result is nothing new, but it seems to confirm strongly R. Brown,\r\nfor I have succeeded (perhaps he did, but he does not say so) in tracing\r\nthe vessels belonging to each organ in front of each other to the same\r\nbundle in the ovarium: thus the vessels going to the lower sepal, to\r\nthe side of the labellum, and to one stigma (when there are two) all\r\ndistinctly branch from one ovarian bundle. So in other cases, but I have\r\nnot completely traced (only seen) that going to the rostellum. But here\r\ncomes my only point of novelty: in all orchids as yet looked at (even\r\none with so simple a labellum as Gymnadenia and Malaxis) the vessels on\r\nthe two sides of the labellum are derived from the bundle which goes to\r\nthe lower sepal, as in the diagram. This leads me to conclude that the\r\nlabellum is always a compound organ. Now I want to know whether it\r\nis conceivable that the vessels coming from one main bundle should\r\npenetrate an organ (the labellum) which receives its vessels from\r\nanother main bundle? Does it not imply that all that part of the\r\nlabellum which is supplied by vessels coming from a lateral bundle must\r\nbe part of a primordially distinct organ, however closely the two may\r\nhave become united? It is curious in Gymnadenia to trace the middle\r\nanterior bundle in the ovarium: when it comes to the orifice of the\r\nnectary it turns and runs right down it, then comes up the opposite side\r\nand runs to the apex of the labellum, whence each side of the nectary\r\nis supplied by vessels from the bundles, coming from the lower sepals.\r\nHence even the thin nectary is essentially, I infer, tripartite; hence\r\nits tendency to bifurcation at its top. This view of the labellum always\r\nconsisting of three organs (I believe four when thick, as in Mormodes,\r\nat base) seems to me to explain its great size and tripartite form,\r\ncompared with the other petals. Certainly, if I may trust the vessels,\r\nthe simple labellum of Gymnadenia consists of three organs soldered\r\ntogether. Forgive me for writing at such length; a very brief answer\r\nwill suffice. I am desperately interested in the subject: the destiny\r\nof the whole human race is as nothing to the course of vessels of\r\norchids...\r\n\r\nWhat plant has the most complex single stigma and pistil? The most\r\ncomplex I, in my ignorance, can think of is in Iris. I want to know\r\nwhether anything beats in modification the rostellum of Catasetum.\r\nTo-morrow I mean to be at Catasetum. Hurrah! What species is it? It\r\nis wonderfully different from that which Veitch sent me, which was C.\r\nsaccatum.\r\n\r\nAccording to the vessels, an orchid flower consists of three sepals and\r\ntwo petals free; and of a compound organ (its labellum), consisting\r\nof one petal and of two (or three) modified anthers; and of a second\r\ncompound body consisting of three pistils, one normal anther, and two\r\nmodified anthers often forming the sides of the clinandrum.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 604. TO JOHN LINDLEY.\r\n\r\n(604/1. It was in the autumn of 1861 that Darwin made up his mind to\r\npublish his Orchid work as a book, rather than as a paper in the Linnean\r\nSociety's \"Journal.\" (604/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 266.)\r\nThe following letter shows that the new arrangement served as an\r\nincitement to fresh work.)\r\n\r\nDown, October 25th [1861?]\r\n\r\nMr. James Veitch has been most generous. I did not know that you had\r\nspoken to him. If you see him pray say I am truly grateful; I dare not\r\nwrite to a live Bishop or a Lady, but if I knew the address of \"Rucker\"?\r\nand might use your name as introduction, I might write. I am half mad on\r\nthe subject. Hooker has sent me many exotics, but I stopped him, for I\r\nthought I should make a fool of myself; but since I have determined to\r\npublish I much regret it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 9.--HABENARIA CHLORANTHA (Longitudinal course of bundles).)\r\n\r\n(605/1. The three upper curved outlines, two of which passing through\r\nthe words \"upper sepal,\" \"upper petal,\" \"lower sepal,\" were in red in\r\nthe original; for explanation see text.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 605. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(605/2. The following letter is of interest because it relates to one of\r\nthe two chief difficulties Darwin met with in working out the morphology\r\nof the orchid flower. In the orchid book (605/3. Edition I., page 303.)\r\nhe wrote, \"This anomaly [in Habenaria] is so far of importance, as it\r\nthrows some doubt on the view which I have taken of the labellum being\r\nalways an organ compounded of one petal and two petaloid stamens.\" That\r\nis to say, it leaves it open for a critic to assert that the vessels\r\nwhich enter the sides of the labellum are lateral vessels of the petal\r\nand do not necessarily represent petaloid stamens. In the sequel he\r\ngives a satisfactory answer to the supposed objector.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 10th, [1861].\r\n\r\nFor the love of God help me. I believe all my work (about a\r\nfortnight) is useless. Look at this accursed diagram (Figure 9) of the\r\nbutterfly-orchis [Habenaria], which I examined after writing to you\r\nyesterday, when I thought all my work done. Some of the ducts of the\r\nupper sepal (605/4. These would be described by modern morphologists as\r\nlower, not upper, sepals, etc. Darwin was aware that he used these terms\r\nincorrectly.) and upper petal run to the wrong bundles on the column. I\r\nhave seen no such case.\r\n\r\nThis case apparently shows that not the least reliance can be placed on\r\nthe course of ducts. I am sure of my facts.\r\n\r\nThere is great adhesion and extreme displacement of parts where the\r\norgans spring from the top of the ovarium. Asa Gray says ducts are very\r\nearly developed, and it seems to me wonderful that they should pursue\r\nthis course. It may be said that the lateral ducts in the labellum\r\nrunning into the antero-lateral ovarian bundle is no argument that the\r\nlabellum consists of three organs blended together.\r\n\r\nIn desperation (and from the curious way the base of upper petals are\r\nsoldered at basal edges) I fancied the real form of upper sepal, upper\r\npetal and lower sepal might be as represented by red lines, and that\r\nthere had been an incredible amount of splitting of sepals and petals\r\nand subsequent fusion.\r\n\r\nThis seems a monstrous notion, but I have just looked at Bauer's drawing\r\nof allied Bonatea, and there is a degree of lobing of petals and sepals\r\nwhich would account for anything.\r\n\r\nNow could you spare me a dry flower out of your Herbarium of Bonatea\r\nspeciosa (605/5. See \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition I., page 304\r\n(note), where the resemblances between the anomalous vessels of Bonatea\r\nand Habenaria are described. On November 14th, 1861, he wrote to Sir\r\nJoseph: \"You are a true friend in need. I can hardly bear to let the\r\nBonatea soak long enough.\"), that I might soak and look for ducts. If\r\nI cannot explain the case of Habenaria all my work is smashed. I was a\r\nfool ever to touch orchids.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 606. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 17th [1861].\r\n\r\nWhat two very interesting and useful letters you have sent me. You\r\nrather astound me with respect to value of grounds of generalisation\r\nin the morphology of plants. It reminds me that years ago I sent you\r\na grass to name, and your answer was, \"It is certainly Festuca\r\n(so-and-so), but it agrees as badly with the description as most\r\nplants do.\" I have often laughed over this answer of a great\r\nbotanist...Lindley, from whom I asked for an orchid with a simple\r\nlabellum, has most kindly sent me a lot of what he marks \"rare\" and\r\n\"rarissima\" of peloric orchids, etc., but as they are dried I know not\r\nwhether they will be of use. He has been most kind, and has suggested\r\nmy writing to Lady D. Nevill, who has responded in a wonderfully kind\r\nmanner, and has sent a lot of treasures. But I must stop; otherwise,\r\nby Jove, I shall be transformed into a botanist. I wish I had been one;\r\nthis morphology is surprisingly interesting. Looking to your note, I\r\nmay add that certainly the fifteen alternating bundles of spiral vessels\r\n(mingled with odd beadlike vessels in some cases) are present in many\r\norchids. The inner whorl of anther ducts are oftenest aborted. I must\r\nkeep clear of Apostasia, though I have cast many a longing look at it in\r\nBauer. (606/1. Apostasia has two fertile anthers like Cypripedium. It\r\nis placed by Engler and Prantl in the Apostasieae or Apostasiinae, among\r\nthe Orchideae, by others in a distinct but closely allied group.)\r\n\r\nI hope I may be well enough to read my own paper on Thursday, but I\r\nhave been very seedy lately. (606/2. \"On the two Forms, or Dimorphic\r\nCondition, in the Species of the Genus Primula,\" \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\"\r\n1862. He did read the paper, but it cost him the next day in bed. \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" III., page 299.) I see there is a paper at the Royal on\r\nthe same night, which will more concern you, on fossil plants of Bovey\r\n(606/3. Oswald Heer, \"The Fossil Flora of Bovey Tracey,\" \"Phil. Trans.\r\nR. Soc.\" 1862, page 1039.), so that I suppose I shall not have you; but\r\nyou must read my paper when published, as I shall very much like to hear\r\nwhat you think. It seems to me a large field for experiment. I shall\r\nmake use of my Orchid little volume in illustrating modification of\r\nspecies doctrine, but I keep very, very doubtful whether I am not doing\r\na foolish action in publishing. How I wish you would keep to your old\r\nintention and write a book on plants. (606/4. Possibly a book similar to\r\nthat described in Letter 696.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 607. TO G. BENTHAM. Down, November 26th [1861].\r\n\r\nOur notes have crossed on the road. I know it is an honour to have a\r\npaper in the \"Transactions,\" and I am much obliged to you for proposing\r\nit, but I should greatly prefer to publish in the \"Journal.\" Nor does\r\nthis apply exclusively to myself, for in old days at the Geological\r\nSociety I always protested against an abstract appearing when the paper\r\nitself might appear. I abominate also the waste of time (and it would\r\ntake me a day) in making an abstract. If the referee on my paper should\r\nrecommend it to appear in the \"Transactions,\" will you be so kind as to\r\nlay my earnest request before the Council that it may be permitted to\r\nappear in the \"Journal?\"\r\n\r\nYou must be very busy with your change of residence; but when you are\r\nsettled and have some leisure, perhaps you will be so kind as to give me\r\nsome cases of dimorphism, like that of Primula. Should you object to my\r\nadding them to those given me by A. Gray? By the way, I heard from A.\r\nGray this morning, and he gives me two very curious cases in Boragineae.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 608. TO JOHN LINDLEY.\r\n\r\n(608/1. In the following fragment occurs the earliest mention of\r\nDarwin's work on the three sexual forms of Catasetum tridentatum. Sir\r\nR. Schomburgk (608/2. \"Trans. Linn. Soc.\" XVII., page 522.) described\r\nCatasetum tridentatum, Monacanthus viridis and Myanthus barbatus\r\noccurring on a single plant, but it remained for Darwin to make out that\r\nthey are the male, female and hermaphrodite forms of a single species.\r\n(608/3. \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition I., page 236; Edition II.,\r\npage 196.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the species of Acropera (Gongora) (608/4. Acropera\r\nLoddigesii = Gongora galeata: A. luteola = G. fusca (\"Index Kewensis\").)\r\nhe was wrong in his surmise. The apparent sterility seems to be\r\nexplicable by Hildebrand's discovery (608/5. \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1863\r\nand 1865.) that in some orchids the ovules are not developed until\r\npollinisation has occurred. (608/6. \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition\r\nII., page 172. See Letter 633.))\r\n\r\nDown, December 15th [1861].\r\n\r\nI am so nearly ready for press that I will not ask for anything more;\r\nunless, indeed, you stumbled on Mormodes in flower. As I am writing I\r\nwill just mention that I am convinced from the rudimentary state of\r\nthe ovules, and from the state of the stigma, that the whole plant of\r\nAcropera luteola (and I believe A. Loddigesii) is male. Have you ever\r\nseen any form from the same countries which could be the females? Of\r\ncourse no answer is expected unless you have ever observed anything to\r\nbear on this. I may add [judging from the] state of the ovules and of\r\nthe pollen [that]:--\r\n\r\nCatasetum tridentatum is male (and never seeds, according to Schomburgk,\r\nwhom you have accidentally misquoted in the \"Vegetable Kingdom\").\r\nMonacanthus viridis is female. Myanthus barbatus is the hermaphrodite\r\nform of same species.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 609. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 18th [1861].\r\n\r\nThanks for your note. I have not written for a long time, for I always\r\nfancy, busy as you are, that my letters must be a bore; though I like\r\nwriting, and always enjoy your notes. I can sympathise with you about\r\nfear of scarlet fever: to the day of my death I shall never forget all\r\nthe sickening fear about the other children, after our poor little baby\r\ndied of it. The \"Genera Plantarum\" must be a tremendous work, and no\r\ndoubt very valuable (such a book, odd as it may appear, would be very\r\nuseful even to me), but I cannot help being rather sorry at the length\r\nof time it must take, because I cannot enter on and understand your\r\nwork. Will you not be puzzled when you come to the orchids? It seems to\r\nme orchids alone would be work for a man's lifetime; I cannot somehow\r\nfeel satisfied with Lindley's classification; the Malaxeae and\r\nEpidendreae seem to me very artificially separated. (609/1. Pfitzer (in\r\nthe \"Pflanzenfamilien\") places Epidendrum in the Laeliinae-Cattleyeae,\r\nMalaxis in the Liparidinae. He states that Bentham united the Malaxideae\r\nand Epidendreae.) Not that I have seen enough to form an opinion worth\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nYour African plant seems to be a vegetable Ornithorhynchus, and indeed\r\nmuch more than that. (609/2. See Sir J.D. Hooker, \"On Welwitschia, a new\r\ngenus of Gnetaceae.\" \"Linn. Soc. Trans.\" XXIV., 1862-3.) The more I read\r\nabout plants the more I get to feel that all phanerogams seem comparable\r\nwith one class, as lepidoptera, rather than with one kingdom, as the\r\nwhole insecta. (609/3. He wrote to Hooker (December 28th, 1861): \"I\r\nwrote carelessly about the value of phanerogams; what I was thinking of\r\nwas that the sub-groups seemed to blend so much more one into another\r\nthan with most classes of animals. I suspect crustacea would show more\r\ndifference in the extreme forms than phanerogams, but, as you say, it is\r\nwild speculation. Yet it is very strange what difficulty botanists seem\r\nto find in grouping the families together into masses.\")\r\n\r\nThanks for your comforting sentence about the accursed ducts (accursed\r\nthough they be, I should like nothing better than to work at them in the\r\nallied orders, if I had time). I shall be ready for press in three\r\nor four weeks, and have got all my woodcuts drawn. I fear much that\r\npublishing separately will prove a foolish job, but I do not care much,\r\nand the work has greatly amused me. The Catasetum has not flowered yet!\r\n\r\nIn writing to Lindley about an orchid which he sent me, I told him a\r\nlittle about Acropera, and in answer he suggests that Gongora may be its\r\nfemale. He seems dreadfully busy, and I feel that I have more right to\r\nkill you than to kill him; so can you send me one or at most two dried\r\nflowers of Gongora? if you know the habitat of Acropera luteola, a\r\nGongora from the same country would be the best, but any true Gongora\r\nwould do; if its pollen should prove as rudimentary as that of\r\nMonacanthus relatively to Catasetum, I think I could easily perceive it\r\neven in dried specimens when well soaked.\r\n\r\nI have picked a little out of Lecoq, but it is awful tedious hunting.\r\n\r\nBates is getting on with his natural history travels in one volume.\r\n(609/4. H.W. Bates, the \"Naturalist on the Amazons,\" 1863. See Volume\r\nI., Letters 123, 148, also \"Life and Letters,\" Volume II., page 381.) I\r\nhave read the first chapter in MS., and I think it will be an excellent\r\nbook and very well written; he argues, in a good and new way to me,\r\nthat tropical climate has very little direct relation to the gorgeous\r\ncolouring of insects (though of course he admits the tropics have a far\r\ngreater number of beautiful insects) by taking all the few genera common\r\nto Britain and Amazonia, and he finds that the species proper to the\r\nlatter are not at all more beautiful. I wonder how this is in species of\r\nthe same restricted genera of plants.\r\n\r\nIf you can remember it, thank Bentham for getting my Primula paper\r\nprinted so quickly. I do enjoy getting a subject off one's hands\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nI have now got dimorphism in structure in eight natural orders just like\r\nPrimula. Asa Gray sent me dried flowers of a capital case in Amsinkia\r\nspectabilis, one of the Boragineae. I suppose you do not chance to have\r\nthe plant alive at Kew.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 610. TO A.G. MORE. Down, June 7th, 1862.\r\n\r\nIf you are well and have leisure, will you kindly give me one bit of\r\ninformation: Does Ophrys arachnites occur in the Isle of Wight? or do\r\nthe intermediate forms, which are said to connect abroad this species\r\nand the bee-orchis, ever there occur?\r\n\r\nSome facts have led me to suspect that it might just be possible, though\r\nimprobable in the highest degree, that the bee [orchis] might be the\r\nself-fertilising form of O. arachnites, which requires insects' aid,\r\nsomething [in the same way] as we have self-fertilising flowers of\r\nthe violet and others requiring insects. I know the case is widely\r\ndifferent, as the bee is borne on a separate plant and is incomparably\r\ncommoner. This would remove the great anomaly of the bee being a\r\nperpetual self-fertiliser. Certain Malpighiaceae for years produce only\r\none of the two forms. What has set my head going on this is receiving\r\nto-day a bee having one alone of the best marked characters of O.\r\narachnites. (610/1. Ophrys arachnites is probably more nearly allied to\r\nO. aranifera than to O. apifera. For a case somewhat analogous to\r\nthat suggested see the description of O. scolopax in \"Fertilisation of\r\nOrchids,\" Edition II., page 52.) Pray forgive me troubling you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 611. TO G. BENTHAM. Down, June 22nd [1862?].\r\n\r\nHere is a piece of presumption! I must think that you are mistaken in\r\nranking Hab[enaria] chlorantha (611/1. In Hooker's \"Students' Flora,\"\r\n1884, page 395, H. chlorantha is given as a subspecies of H. bifolia.\r\nSir J.D. Hooker adds that they are \"according to Darwin, distinct, and\r\nrequire different species of moths to fertilise them. They vary in the\r\nposition and distances of their anther-cells, but intermediates occur.\"\r\nSee \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page 73.) as a variety of\r\nH. bifolia; the pollen-masses and stigma differ more than in most of the\r\nbest species of Orchis. When I first examined them I remember telling\r\nHooker that moths would, I felt sure, fertilise them in a different\r\nmanner; and I have just had proof of this in a moth sent me with the\r\npollinia (which can be easily recognised) of H. chlorantha attached to\r\nits proboscis, instead of to the sides of its face, as an H. bifolia.\r\n\r\nForgive me scribbling this way; but when a man gets on his hobby-horse\r\nhe always is run away with. Anyhow, nothing here requires any answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 612. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [September] 14th [1862].\r\n\r\nYour letter is a mine of wealth, but first I must scold you: I cannot\r\nabide to hear you abuse yourself, even in joke, and call yourself a\r\nstupid dog. You, in fact, thus abuse me, because for long years I have\r\nlooked up to you as the man whose opinion I have valued more on any\r\nscientific subject than any one else in the world. I continually\r\nmarvel at what you know, and at what you do. I have been looking at the\r\n\"Genera\" (612/1. \"Genera Plantarum,\" by Bentham and Hooker, Volume I.,\r\nPart I., 1862.), and of course cannot judge at all of its real value,\r\nbut I can judge of the amount of condensed facts under each family and\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nI am glad you know my feeling of not being able to judge about one's own\r\nwork; but I suspect that you have been overworking. I should think you\r\ncould not give too much time to Wellwitchia (I spell it different every\r\ntime I write it) (612/2. \"On Welwitschia,\" \"Linn. Soc. Trans.\" [1862],\r\nXXIV., 1863.); at least I am sure in the animal kingdom monographs\r\ncannot be too long on the osculant groups.\r\n\r\nHereafter I shall be excessively glad to read a paper about Aldrovanda\r\n(612/3. See \"Insectivorous Plants,\" page 321.), and am very much obliged\r\nfor reference. It is pretty to see how the caught flies support Drosera;\r\nnothing else can live.\r\n\r\nThanks about plants with two kinds of anthers. I presume (if an included\r\nflower was a Cassia) (612/4. Todd has described a species of Cassia with\r\nan arrangement of stamens like the Melastomads. See Chapter 2.X.II.)\r\nthat Cassia is like lupines, but with some stamens still more\r\nrudimentary. If I hear I will return the three Melastomads; I do not\r\nwant them, and, indeed, have cuttings. I am very low about them, and\r\nhave wasted enormous labour over them, and cannot yet get a glimpse of\r\nthe meaning of the parts. I wish I knew any botanical collector to whom\r\nI could apply for seeds in their native land of any Heterocentron or\r\nMonochoetum; I have raised plenty of seedlings from your plants, but\r\nI find in other cases that from a homomorphic union one generally gets\r\nsolely the parent form. Do you chance to know of any botanical collector\r\nin Mexico or Peru? I must not now indulge myself with looking after\r\nvessels and homologies. Some future time I will indulge myself. By the\r\nway, some time I want to talk over the alternation of organs in flowers\r\nwith you, for I think I must have quite misunderstood you that it was\r\nnot explicable.\r\n\r\nI found out the Verbascum case by pure accident, having transplanted\r\none for experiment, and finding it to my astonishment utterly sterile.\r\nI formerly thought with you about rarity of natural hybrids, but I am\r\nbeginning to change: viz., oxlips (not quite proven), Verbascum, Cistus\r\n(not quite proven), Aegilops triticoides (beautifully shown by Godron),\r\nWeddell's and your orchids (612/5. For Verbascum see \"Animals and\r\nPlants,\" Edition II., Volume I., page 356; for Cistus, Ibid., Edition\r\nII., Volume I., page 356, Volume II., page 122; for Aegilops, Ibid.,\r\nEdition II., Volume I., page 330, note.), and I daresay many others\r\nrecorded. Your letters are one of my greatest pleasures in life, but I\r\nearnestly beg you never to write unless you feel somewhat inclined, for\r\nI know how hard you work, as I work only in the morning it is different\r\nwith me, and is only a pleasant relaxation. You will never know how much\r\nI owe to you for your constant kindness and encouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 613. TO JOHN LUBBOCK (Lord Avebury). Cliff Cottage, Bournemouth,\r\nHants, September 2nd [1862].\r\n\r\nHearty thanks for your note. I am so glad that your tour answered so\r\nsplendidly. My poor patients (613/1. Mrs. Darwin and one of her sons,\r\nboth recovering from scarlet fever.) got here yesterday, and are doing\r\nwell, and we have a second house for the well ones. I write now in great\r\nhaste to beg you to look (though I know how busy you are, but I cannot\r\nthink of any other naturalist who would be careful) at any field of\r\ncommon red clover (if such a field is near you) and watch the hive-bees:\r\nprobably (if not too late) you will see some sucking at the mouth of the\r\nlittle flowers and some few sucking at the base of the flowers, at holes\r\nbitten through the corollas. All that you will see is that the bees put\r\ntheir heads deep into the [flower] head and rout about. Now, if you see\r\nthis, do for Heaven's sake catch me some of each and put in spirits and\r\nkeep them separate. I am almost certain that they belong to two castes,\r\nwith long and short proboscids. This is so curious a point that it seems\r\nworth making out. I cannot hear of a clover field near here.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 614. TO JOHN LUBBOCK (Lord Avebury). Cliff Cottage, Bournemouth,\r\nWednesday, September 3rd [1862].\r\n\r\nI beg a million pardons. Abuse me to any degree, but forgive me: it\r\nis all an illusion (but almost excusable) about the bees. (614/1.\r\nH. Muller, \"Fertilisation of Flowers,\" page 186, describes hive-bees\r\nvisiting Trifolium pratense for the sake of the pollen. Darwin may\r\nperhaps have supposed that these were the variety of bees whose\r\nproboscis was long enough to reach the nectar. In \"Cross and Self\r\nFertilisation,\" page 361, Darwin describes hive-bees apparently\r\nsearching for a secretion on the calyx. In the same passage in \"Cross\r\nand Self Fertilisation\" he quotes Muller as stating that hive-bees\r\nobtain nectar from red clover by breaking apart the petals. This seems\r\nto us a misinterpretation of the \"Befruchtung der Blumen,\" page 224.) I\r\ndo so hope that you have not wasted any time from my stupid blunder. I\r\nhate myself, I hate clover, and I hate bees.\r\n\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 10.--DIAGRAM OF CRUCIFEROUS FLOWER.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 11.--DISSECTION OF CRUCIFEROUS FLOWER.\r\n\r\nLaid flat open, showing by dotted lines the course of spiral vessels\r\nin all the organs; sepals and petals shown on one side alone, with the\r\nstamens on one side above with course of vessels indicated, but not\r\nprolonged. Near side of pistil with one spiral vessel cut away.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 615. TO J.D. HOOKER. Cliff Cottage, Bournemouth, September 11th,\r\n1862.\r\n\r\nYou once told me that Cruciferous flowers were anomalous in alternation\r\nof parts, and had given rise to some theory of dedoublement.\r\n\r\nHaving nothing on earth to do here, I have dissected all the spiral\r\nvessels in a flower, and instead of burning my diagrams [Figures 10 and\r\n11], I send them to you, you miserable man. But mind, I do not want you\r\nto send me a discussion, but just some time to say whether my notions\r\nare rubbish, and then burn the diagrams. It seems to me that all parts\r\nalternate beautifully by fours, on the hypothesis that two short\r\nstamens of outer whorl are aborted (615/1. The view given by Darwin is\r\n(according to Eichler) that previously held by Knuth, Wydler, Chatin,\r\nand others. Eichler himself believes that the flower is dimerous, the\r\nfour longer stamens being produced by the doubling or splitting of the\r\nupper (i.e. antero-posterior) pair of stamens. If this view is correct,\r\nand there are good reasons for it, it throws much suspicion on the\r\nevidence afforded by the course of vessels, for there is no trace of the\r\ncommon origin of the longer stamens in the diagram (Figure 11). Again,\r\nif Eichler is right, the four vessels shown in the section of the ovary\r\nare misleading. Darwin afterwards gave a doubtful explanation of this,\r\nand concluded that the ovary is dimerous. See Letter 616.); and this\r\nview is perhaps supported by their being so few, only two sub-bundles\r\nin the two lateral main bundles, where I imagine two short stamens\r\nhave aborted, but I suppose there is some valid objection against this\r\nnotion. The course of the side vessels in the sepals is curious, just\r\nlike my difficulty in Habenaria. (615/2. See Letter 605.) I am surprised\r\nat the four vessels in the ovarium. Can this indicate four confluent\r\npistils? anyhow, they are in the right alternating position. The nectary\r\nwithin the base of the shorter stamens seems to cause the end sepals\r\napparently, but not really, to arise beneath the lateral sepals.\r\n\r\nI think you will understand my diagrams in five minutes, so forgive me\r\nfor bothering you. My writing this to you reminds me of a letter which I\r\nreceived yesterday from Claparede, who helped the French translatress\r\nof the \"Origin\" (615/3. The late Mlle. Royer.), and he tells me he had\r\ndifficulty in preventing her (who never looked at a bee's cell) from\r\naltering my whole description, because she affirmed that an hexagonal\r\nprism must have an hexagonal base! Almost everywhere in the \"Origin,\"\r\nwhen I express great doubt, she appends a note explaining the\r\ndifficulty, or saying that there is none whatever!! (615/4. See\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" II., page 387.) It is really curious to know what\r\nconceited people there are in the world (people, for instance, after\r\nlooking at one Cruciferous flower, explain their homologies).\r\n\r\nThis is a nice, but most barren country, and I can find nothing to\r\nlook at. Even the brooks and ponds produce nothing. The country is like\r\nPatagonia. my wife is almost well, thank God, and Leonard is wonderfully\r\nimproved ...Good God, what an illness scarlet fever is! The doctor\r\nfeared rheumatic fever for my wife, but she does not know her risk. It\r\nis now all over.\r\n\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 12.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 616. TO J.D. HOOKER. Cliff Cottage, Bournemouth, Thursday Evening\r\n[September 18th, 1862].\r\n\r\nThanks for your pleasant note, which told me much news, and upon the\r\nwhole good, of yourselves. You will be awfully busy for a time, but I\r\nwrite now to say that if you think it really worth while to send me a\r\nfew Dielytra, or other Fumariaceous plant (which I have already tried\r\nin vain to find here) in a little tin box, I will try and trace the\r\nvessels; but please observe, I do not know that I shall have time, for I\r\nhave just become wonderfully interested in experimenting on Drosera with\r\npoisons, etc. If you send any Fumariaceous plant, send if you can, also\r\ntwo or three single balsams. After writing to you, I looked at vessels\r\nof ovary of a sweet-pea, and from this and other cases I believe that in\r\nthe ovary the midrib vessel alone gives homologies, and that the vessels\r\non the edge of the carpel leaf often run into the wrong bundle, just\r\nlike those on the sides of the sepals. Hence I [suppose] in Crucifers\r\nthat the ovarium consists of two pistils; AA [Figure 12] being the\r\nmidrib vessels, and BB being those formed of the vessels on edges of the\r\ntwo carpels, run together, and going to wrong bundles. I came to this\r\nconclusion before receiving your letter.\r\n\r\nI wonder why Asa Gray will not believe in the quaternary arrangement;\r\nI had fancied that you saw some great difficulty in the case, and that\r\nmade me think that my notion must be wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 617. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 27th [1862].\r\n\r\nMasdevallia turns out nothing wonderful (617/1. This may refer to the\r\nhomologies of the parts. He was unable to understand the mechanism of\r\nthe flower.--\"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page 136.); I was\r\nmerely stupid about it; I am not the less obliged for its loan, for if\r\nI had lived till 100 years old I should have been uneasy about it. It\r\nshall be returned the first day I send to Bromley. I have steamed the\r\nother plants, and made the sensitive plant very sensitive, and\r\nshall soon try some experiments on it. But after all it will only be\r\namusement. Nevertheless, if not causing too much trouble, I should be\r\nvery glad of a few young plants of this and Hedysarum in summer (617/2.\r\nHedysarum or Desmodium gyrans, the telegraph-plant.), for this kind\r\nof work takes no time and amuses me much. Have you seeds of Oxalis\r\nsensitiva, which I see mentioned in books? By the way, what a fault it\r\nis in Henslow's \"Botany\" that he gives hardly any references; he alludes\r\nto great series of experiments on absorption of poison by roots, but\r\nwhere to find them I cannot guess. Possibly the all-knowing Oliver may\r\nknow. I can plainly see that the glands of Drosera, from rapid power\r\n(almost instantaneous) of absorption and power of movement, give\r\nenormous advantage for such experiments. And some day I will enjoy\r\nmyself with a good set to work; but it will be a great advantage if I\r\ncan get some preliminary notion on other sensitive plants and on roots.\r\n\r\nOliver said he would speak about some seeds of Lythrum hyssopifolium\r\nbeing preserved for me. By the way, I am rather disgusted to find\r\nI cannot publish this year on Lythrum salicaria; I must make 126\r\nadditional crosses. All that I expected is true, but I have plain\r\nindication of much higher complexity. There are three pistils of\r\ndifferent structure and functional power, and I strongly suspect\r\naltogether five kinds of pollen all different in this one species!\r\n(617/3. See \"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page 138.)\r\n\r\nBy any chance have you at Kew any odd varieties of the common potato? I\r\nwant to grow a few plants of every variety, to compare flowers, leaves,\r\nfruit, etc., as I have done with peas, etc. (617/4. \"Animals and\r\nPlants,\" Edition II., Volume I., page 346. Compare also the similar\r\nfacts with regard to cabbages, loc. cit., page 342. Some of the original\r\nspecimens are in the Botanical Museum at Cambridge.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 618. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(618/1. The following is part of Letter 144, Volume I. It refers to\r\nreviews of \"Fertilisation of Orchids\" in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\"\r\n1862, pages 789, 863, 910, and in the \"Natural History Review,\" October,\r\n1862, page 371.)\r\n\r\nNovember 7th, 1862.\r\n\r\nDear old Darwin,\r\n\r\nI assure you it was not my fault! I worried Lindley over and over again\r\nto notice your orchid book in the \"Chronicle\" by the very broadest hints\r\nman could give. (618/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 273.) At\r\nlast he said, \"really I cannot, you must do it for me,\" and so I\r\ndid--volontiers. Lindley felt that he ought to have done it himself, and\r\nmy main effort was to write it \"a la Lindley,\" and in this alone I have\r\nsucceeded--that people all think it is exactly Lindley's style!!! which\r\ndiverts me vastly. The fact is, between ourselves, I fear that poor L.\r\nis breaking up--he said that he could not fix his mind on your book. He\r\nworks himself beyond his mental or physical powers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my dear Darwin, I may as well make a clean breast of it, and\r\ntell you that I wrote the \"Nat. Hist. Review\" notice too--to me a very\r\ndifficult task, and one I fancied I failed in, comparatively. Of this\r\nyou are no judge, and can be none; you told me to tell Oliver it pleased\r\nyou, and so I am content and happy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 619. TO W.E. DARWIN. Down, 4th [about 1862-3?]\r\n\r\nI have been looking at the fertilisation of wheat, and I think possibly\r\nyou might find something curious. I observed in almost every one of\r\nthe pollen-grains, which had become empty and adhered to (I suppose the\r\nviscid) branching hairs of the stigma, that the pollen-tube was always\r\n(?) emitted on opposite side of grain to that in contact with the branch\r\nof the stigma. This seems very odd. The branches of the stigma are\r\nvery thin, formed apparently of three rows of cells of hardly greater\r\ndiameter than pollen-tube. I am astonished that the tubes should be able\r\nto penetrate the walls. The specimens examined (not carefully by me)\r\nhad pollen only during few hours on stigma; and the mere SUSPICION has\r\ncrossed me that the pollen-tubes crawl down these branches to the base\r\nand then penetrate the stigmatic tissue. (619/1. See Strasburger's \"Neue\r\nUntersuchungen uber den Befruchtungsvorgang bei den Phanerogamen,\" 1884.\r\nIn Alopecurus pratensis he describes the pollen as adhering to the end\r\nof a projection from the stigma where it germinates; the tube crawls\r\nalong or spirally round this projection until it reaches the angle where\r\nthe stigmatic branch is given off; here it makes an entrance and travels\r\nin the middle lamella between two cells.) The paleae open for a\r\nshort period for stigma to be dusted, and then close again, and such\r\ntravelling down would take place under protection. High powers and good\r\nadjustment are necessary. Ears expel anthers when kept in water in room;\r\nbut the paleae apparently do not open and expose stigma; but the stigma\r\ncould easily be artificially impregnated.\r\n\r\nIf I were you I would keep memoranda of points worth attending to.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.X.II. MELASTOMACEAE, 1862-1881.\r\n\r\n(620/1. The following series of letters (620-630) refers to the\r\nMelastomaceae and certain other flowers of analogous form. In 1862\r\nDarwin attempted to explain the existence of two very different sets of\r\nstamens in these plants as a case of dimorphism, somewhat analogous to\r\nthe state of things in Primula. In this view he was probably wrong,\r\nbut this does not diminish the interest of the crossing experiments\r\ndescribed in the letters. The persistence of his interest in this part\r\nof the subject is shown in the following passage from his Preface to the\r\nEnglish translation of H. Muller's \"Befruchtung der Blumen\"; the passage\r\nis dated February, 1882, but was not published until the following year.\r\n\r\n\"There exist also some few plants the flowers of which include two sets\r\nof stamens, differing in the shape of the anthers and in the colour of\r\nthe pollen; and at present no one knows whether this difference has\r\nany functional significance, and this is a point which ought to be\r\ndetermined.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not obvious why he spoke of the problem as if no light had been\r\nthrown on it, since in 1881 Fritz Muller had privately (see Letter 629)\r\noffered an explanation which Darwin was strongly inclined to accept.\r\n(620/2. H. Muller published (\"Nature,\" August 4th, 1881) a letter\r\nfrom his brother Fritz giving the theory in question for Heeria. Todd\r\n(\"American Naturalist,\" April 1882), described a similar state of things\r\nin Solanum rostratum and in Cassia: and H.O. Forbes (\"Nature,\" August\r\n1882, page 386) has done the same for Melastoma. In Rhexia virginica Mr.\r\nW.H. Leggett (\"Bulletin Torrey Bot. Club, New York,\" VIII., 1881, page\r\n102) describes the curious structure of the anther, which consists of\r\ntwo inflated portions and a tubular part connecting the two. By pressing\r\nwith a blunt instrument on one of the ends, the pollen is forced out\r\nin a jet through a fine pore in the other inflated end. Mr. Leggett has\r\nseen bees treading on the anthers, but could not get near enough to\r\nsee the pollen expelled. In the same journal, Volume IX., page 11,\r\nMr. Bailey describes how in Heterocentron roseum, \"upon pressing the\r\nbellows-like anther with a blunt pencil, the pollen was ejected to\r\na full inch in distance.\" On Lagerstroemia as comparable with the\r\nMelastomads see Letter 689.) Fritz Muller's theory with regard to\r\nthe Melastomads and a number of analogous cases in other genera are\r\ndiscussed in H. Muller's article in \"Kosmos\" (620/3. \"Kosmos,\" XIII.,\r\n1883, page 241.), where the literature is given. F. Muller's theory is\r\nthat in Heeria the yellow anthers serve merely as a means of attracting\r\npollen-collecting bees, while the longer stamens with purple or crimson\r\nanthers supply pollen for fertilising purposes. If Muller is right the\r\npollen from the yellow anthers would not normally reach the stigma. The\r\nincreased vigour observed in the seedlings from the yellow anthers\r\nwould seem to resemble the good effect of a cross between different\r\nindividuals of the same species as worked out in \"Cross and Self\r\nFertilisation,\" for it is difficult to believe that the pollen of the\r\npurple anthers has become, by adaptation, less effective than that\r\nof the yellow anthers. In the letters here given there is some\r\ncontradiction between the statements as to the position of the two\r\nsets of stamens in relation to the sepals. According to Eichler\r\n(\"Bluthendiagramme, II., page 482) the longer stamens may be either\r\nepipetalous or episepalous in this family.\r\n\r\nThe work on the Melastomads is of such intrinsic importance that we have\r\nthought it right to give the correspondence in considerable detail; we\r\nhave done so in spite of the fact that Darwin arrived at no\r\ndefinite conclusion, and in spite of an element of confusion and\r\nunsatisfactoriness in the series of letters. This applies also to Letter\r\n629, written after Darwin had learned Fritz Muller's theory, which is\r\nobscured by some errors or slips of the pen.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 620. TO G. BENTHAM. Down, February 3rd [1862?]\r\n\r\nAs you so kindly helped me before on dimorphism, will you forgive me\r\nbegging for a little further information, if in your power to give it?\r\nThe case is that of the Melastomads with eight stamens, on which I have\r\nbeen experimenting. I am perplexed by opposed statements: Lindley says\r\nthe stamens which face the petals are sterile; Wallich says in Oxyspora\r\npaniculata that the stamens which face the sepals are destitute of\r\npollen; I find plenty of apparently good pollen in both sets of stamens\r\nin Heterocentron [Heeria], Monochoetum, and Centradenia. Can you throw\r\nany light on this? But there is another point on which I am more anxious\r\nfor information. Please look at the enclosed miserable diagram. I find\r\nthat the pollen of the yellow petal-facing stamens produce more than\r\ntwice as much seed as the pollen of the purple sepal-facing stamens.\r\nThis is exactly opposed to Lindley's statement--viz., that the\r\npetal-facing stamens are sterile. But I cannot at present believe that\r\nthe case has any relation to abortion; it is hardly possible to believe\r\nthat the longer and very curious stamens, which face the sepals in\r\nthis Heterocentron, are tending to be rudimentary, though their\r\npollen applied to their own flowers produces so much less seed. It is\r\nconformable with what we see in Primula that the [purple] sepal-facing\r\nanthers, which in the plant seen by me stood quite close on each side\r\nof the stigma, should have been rendered less fitted to fertilise the\r\nstigma than the stamens on the opposite side of the flower. Hence the\r\nsuspicion has crossed me that if many plants of the Heterocentron roseum\r\nwere examined, half would be found with the pistil nearly upright,\r\ninstead of being rectangularly bent down, as shown in the diagram\r\n(620/4. According to Willis, \"Flowering Plants and Ferns,\" 1897, Volume\r\nII., page 252, the style in Monochoetum, \"at first bent downwards, moves\r\nslowly up till horizontal.\"); or, if the position of pistil is fixed,\r\nthat in half the plants the petal-facing stamens would bend down, and in\r\nthe other half of the plants the sepal-facing stamens would bend down as\r\nin the diagram. I suspect the former case, as in Centradenia I find the\r\npistil nearly straight. Can you tell me? (620/5. No reply by Mr.\r\nBentham to this or the following queries has been found.) Can the name\r\nHeterocentron have any reference to such diversity? Would it be\r\nasking too great a favour to ask you to look at dried specimens of\r\nHeterocentron roseum (which would be best), or of Monochoetum, or any\r\neight-stamened Melastomad, of which you have specimens from several\r\nlocalities (as this would ensure specimens having been taken from\r\ndistinct plants), and observe whether the pistil bends differently or\r\nstamens differently in different plants? You will at once see that, if\r\nsuch were the fact, it would be a new form of dimorphism, and would open\r\nup a large field of inquiry with respect to the potency of the pollen in\r\nall plants which have two sets of stamens--viz., longer and shorter. Can\r\nyou forgive me for troubling you at such unreasonable length? But it is\r\nsuch waste of time to experiment without some guiding light. I do not\r\nknow whether you have attended particularly to Melastoma; if you\r\nhave not, perhaps Hooker or Oliver may have done so. I should be very\r\ngrateful for any information, as it will guide future experiments.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Do you happen to know, when there are only four stamens, whether\r\nit is the petal or sepal-facers which are preserved? and whether in the\r\nfour-stamened forms the pistil is rectangularly bent or is straight?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 621. TO ASA GRAY. Down, February 16th [1862?].\r\n\r\nI have been trying a few experiments on Melastomads; and they seem to\r\nindicate that the pollen of the two curious sets of anthers (i.e. the\r\npetal-facers and the sepal-facers) have very different powers; and it\r\ndoes not seem that the difference is connected with any tendency to\r\nabortion in the one set. Now I think I can understand the structure of\r\nthe flower and means of fertilisation, if there be two forms,--one with\r\nthe pistil bent rectangularly out of the flower, and the other with it\r\nnearly straight.\r\n\r\nOur hot-house and green-house plants have probably all descended by\r\ncuttings from a single plant of each species; so I can make out nothing\r\nfrom them. I applied in vain to Bentham and Hooker; but Oliver picked\r\nout some sentences from Naudin, which seem to indicate differences in\r\nthe position of the pistil.\r\n\r\nI see that Rhexia grows in Massachusetts; and I suppose has two\r\ndifferent sets of stamens. Now, if in your power, would you observe the\r\nposition of the pistil in different plants, in lately opened flowers\r\nof the same age? (I specify this because in Monochaetum I find great\r\nchanges of position in the pistils and stamens, as flower gets old).\r\nSupposing that my prophecy should turn out right, please observe whether\r\nin both forms the passage into the flower is not [on] the upper side\r\nof the pistil, owing to the basal part of the pistil lying close to the\r\nring of filaments on the under side of the flower. Also I should like to\r\nknow the colour of the two sets of anthers. This would take you only a\r\nfew minutes, and is the only way I see that I can find out whether these\r\nplants are dimorphic in this peculiar way--i.e., only in the position\r\nof the pistil (621/1. In Exacum and in Saintpaulia the flowers are\r\ndimorphic in this sense: the style projects to either the right or the\r\nleft side of the corolla, from which it follows that a right-handed\r\nflower would fertilise a left-handed one, and vice versa. See Willis,\r\n\"Flowering Plants and Ferns,\" 1897, Volume I., page 73.) and in its\r\nrelation to the two kinds of pollen. I am anxious about this, because if\r\nit should prove so, it will show that all plants with longer and shorter\r\nor otherwise different anthers will have to be examined for dimorphism.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 622. TO ASA GRAY. March 15th [1862].\r\n\r\n...I wrote some little time ago about Rhexia; since then I have been\r\ncarefully watching and experimenting on another genus, Monochaetum; and\r\nI find that the pistil is first bent rectangularly (as in the sketch\r\nsent), and then in a few days becomes straight: the stamens also move.\r\nIf there be not two forms of Rhexia, will you compare the position of\r\nthe part in young and old flowers? I have a suspicion (perhaps it will\r\nbe proved wrong when the seed-capsules are ripe) that one set of anthers\r\nare adapted to the pistil in early state, and the other set for it\r\nin its later state. If bees visit the Rhexia, for Heaven's sake watch\r\nexactly how the anther and stigma strike them, both in old and young\r\nflowers, and give me a sketch.\r\n\r\nAgain I say, do not hate me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 623. TO J.D. HOOKER. Leith Hill Place, Dorking, Thursday, 15th\r\n[May 1862].\r\n\r\nYou stated at the Linnean Society that different sets of seedling\r\nCinchona (623/1. Cinchona is apparently heterostyled: see \"Forms of\r\nFlowers,\" Edition II., page 134.) grew at very different rate, and from\r\nmy Primula case you attributed it probably to two sorts of pollen. I\r\nconfess I thought you rash, but I now believe you were quite right.\r\nI find the yellow and crimson anthers of the same flower in the\r\nMelastomatous Heterocentron roseum have different powers; the yellow\r\nproducing on the same plant thrice as many seeds as the crimson anthers.\r\nI got my neighbour's most skilful gardener to sow both kinds of seeds,\r\nand yesterday he came to me and said it is a most extraordinary thing\r\nthat though both lots have been treated exactly alike, one lot all\r\nremain dwarfs and the other lot are all rising high up. The dwarfs were\r\nproduced by the pollen of the crimson anthers. In Monochaetum ensiferum\r\nthe facts are more complex and still more strange; as the age and\r\nposition of the pistils comes into play, in relation to the two kinds of\r\npollen. These facts seem to me so curious that I do not scruple to ask\r\nyou to see whether you can lend me any Melastomad just before flowering,\r\nwith a not very small flower, and which will endure for a short time a\r\ngreenhouse or sitting-room; when fertilised and watered I could send it\r\nto Mr. Turnbull's to a cool stove to mature seed. I fully believe the\r\ncase is worth investigation.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You will not have time at present to read my orchid book; I never\r\nbefore felt half so doubtful about anything which I published. When you\r\nread it, do not fear \"punishing\" me if I deserve it.\r\n\r\nAdios. I am come here to rest, which I much want.\r\n\r\nWhenever you have occasion to write, pray tell me whether you have\r\nRhododendron Boothii from Bhootan, with a smallish yellow flower,\r\nand pistil bent the wrong way; if so, I would ask Oliver to look for\r\nnectary, for it is an abominable error of Nature that must be corrected.\r\nI could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the pistil.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 624. TO ASA GRAY. January 19th [1863].\r\n\r\nI have been at those confounded Melastomads again; throwing good money\r\n(i.e. time) after bad. Do you remember telling me you could see no\r\nnectar in your Rhexia? well, I can find none in Monochaetum, and Bates\r\ntells me that the flowers are in the most marked manner neglected by\r\nbees and lepidoptera in Amazonia. Now the curious projections or horns\r\nto the stamens of Monochaetum are full of fluid, and the suspicion\r\noccurs to me that diptera or small hymenoptera may puncture these horns\r\nlike they puncture (proved since my orchid book was published) the dry\r\nnectaries of true Orchis. I forget whether Rhexia is common; but I very\r\nmuch wish you would next summer watch on a warm day a group of flowers,\r\nand see whether they are visited by small insects, and what they do.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 625. TO I.A. HENRY. Down, January 20th [1863].\r\n\r\n...You must kindly permit me to mention any point on which I want\r\ninformation. If you are so inclined, I am curious to know from\r\nsystematic experiments whether Mr. D. Beaton's statement that the pollen\r\nof two shortest anthers of scarlet Pelargonium produce dwarf plants\r\n(625/1. See \"Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume II., page 150, for\r\na brief account of Darwin's experiments on this genus. Also loc. cit.,\r\npage 338 (note), for a suggested experiment.), in comparison with plants\r\nproduced from the same mother-plant by the pollen of longer stamens from\r\nthe same flower. It would aid me much in some laborious experiments on\r\nMelastomads. I confess I feel a little doubtful; at least, I feel pretty\r\nnearly sure that I know the meaning of short stamens in most plants.\r\nThis summer (for another object) I crossed Queen of Scarlet Pelargonium\r\nwith pollen of long and short stamens of multiflora alba, and it so\r\nturns out that plants from short stamens are the tallest; but I believe\r\nthis to have been mere chance. My few crosses in Pelargonium were made\r\nto get seed from the central peloric or regular flower (I have got one\r\nfrom peloric flower by pollen of peloric), and this leads me to suggest\r\nthat it would be very interesting to test fertility of peloric flowers\r\nin three ways,--own peloric pollen on peloric stigma, common pollen\r\non peloric stigma, peloric pollen on common stigma of same species. My\r\nobject is to discover whether with change of structure of flower there\r\nis any change in fertility of pollen or of female organs. This might\r\nalso be tested by trying peloric and common pollen on stigma of a\r\ndistinct species, and conversely. I believe there is a peloric and\r\ncommon variety of Tropaeolum, and a peloric or upright and common\r\nvariation of some species of Gloxinia, and the medial peloric flowers of\r\nPelargonium, and probably others unknown to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 626. TO I.A. HENRY. Hartfield, May 2nd [1863].\r\n\r\nIn scarlet dwarf Pelargonium, you will find occasionally an additional\r\nand abnormal stamen on opposite and lower side of flower. Now the pollen\r\nof this one occasional short stamen, I think, very likely would produce\r\ndwarf plants. If you experiment on Pelargonium I would suggest your\r\nlooking out for this single stamen.\r\n\r\nI observed fluctuations in length of pistil in Phloxes, but thought it\r\nwas mere variability.\r\n\r\nIf you could raise a bed of seedling Phloxes of any species except\r\nP. Drummondii, it would be highly desirable to see if two forms are\r\npresented, and I should be very grateful for information and flowers for\r\ninspection. I cannot remember, but I know that I had some reason to look\r\nafter Phloxes. (626/1. See \"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page 119,\r\nwhere the conjecture is hazarded that Phlox subulata shows traces of a\r\nformer heterostyled condition.)\r\n\r\nI do not know whether you have used microscopes much yet. It adds\r\nimmensely to interest of all such work as ours, and is indeed\r\nindispensable for much work. Experience, however, has fully convinced me\r\nthat the use of the compound without the simple microscope is absolutely\r\ninjurious to progress of N[atural] History (excepting, of course, with\r\nInfusoria). I have, as yet, found no exception to the rule, that when a\r\nman has told me he works with the compound alone his work is valueless.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 627. TO ASA GRAY. March 20th [1863].\r\n\r\nI wrote to him [Dr. H. Cruger, of Trinidad] to ask him to observe what\r\nthe insects did in the flowers of Melastomaceae: he says not proper\r\nseason yet, but that on one species a small bee seemed busy about the\r\nhorn-like appendages to the anthers. It will be too good luck if\r\nmy study of the flowers in the greenhouse has led me to right\r\ninterpretation of these appendages.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 628. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 28th [1871].\r\n\r\nIf you had come here on Sunday I should have asked you whether you could\r\ngive me seed or seedlings of any Melastomad which would flower soon to\r\nexperiment on! I wrote also to J. Scott to ask if he could give me seed.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I raised a lot of seedlings of a Melastomad greenhouse\r\nbush (Monochaetus or some such name) (628/1. Monochaetum.) from stigmas\r\nfertilised separately by the two kinds of pollen, and the seedlings\r\ndiffered remarkably in size, and whilst young, in appearance; and I\r\nnever knew what to think of the case (so you must not use it), and\r\nhave always wished to try again, but they are troublesome beasts to\r\nfertilise.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I could detect no difference in the product from\r\nthe two coloured anthers of Clarkia. (628/2. Clarkia has eight stamens\r\ndivided into two groups which differ in the colour of the anthers.) If\r\nyou want to know further particulars of my experiments on Monochaetum\r\n(?) and Clarkia, I will hunt for my notes. You ask about difference in\r\npollen in the same species. All dimorphic and trimorphic plants present\r\nsuch difference in function and in size. Lythrum and the trimorphic\r\nOxalis are the most wonderful cases. The pollen of the closed imperfect\r\ncleistogamic flowers differ in the transparency of the integument, and\r\nI think in size. The latter point I could ascertain from my notes. The\r\npollen or female organs must differ in almost every individual in some\r\nmanner; otherwise the pollen of varieties and even distinct individuals\r\nof same varieties would not be so prepotent over the individual plant's\r\nown pollen. Here follows a case of individual differences in function of\r\npollen or ovules or both. Some few individuals of Reseda odorata and R.\r\nlutea cannot be fertilised, or only very rarely, by pollen of the same\r\nplant, but can by pollen of any other individual. I chanced to have two\r\nplants of R. odorata in this state; so I crossed them and raised five\r\nseedlings, all of which were self sterile and all perfectly fertile\r\nwith pollen of any other individual mignonette. So I made a self sterile\r\nrace! I do not know whether these are the kinds of facts which you\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nThink whether you can help me to seed or better seedlings (not cuttings)\r\nof any Melastomad.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 629. TO F. MULLER. Down, March 20th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI have received the seeds and your most interesting letter of February\r\n7th. The seeds shall be sown, and I shall like to see the plants\r\nsleeping; but I doubt whether I shall make any more detailed\r\nobservations on this subject, as, now that I feel very old, I require\r\nthe stimulus of some novelty to make me work. This stimulus you\r\nhave amply given me in your remarkable view of the meaning of the\r\ntwo-coloured stamens in many flowers. I was so much struck with this\r\nfact with Lythrum, that I began experimenting on some Melastomaceae,\r\nwhich have two sets of extremely differently coloured anthers. After\r\nreading your letter I turned to my notes (made 20 years ago!) to see\r\nwhether they would support or contradict your suggestion. I cannot tell\r\nyet, but I have come across one very remarkable result, that seedlings\r\nfrom the crimson anthers were not 11/20ths of the size of seedlings from\r\nthe yellow anthers of the same flowers. Fewer good seeds were produced\r\nby the crimson pollen. I concluded that the shorter stamens were\r\naborting, and that the pollen was not good. (629/1. \"Shorter stamens\"\r\nseems to be a slip of the pen for \"longer,\"--unless the observations\r\nwere made on some genus in which the structure is unusual.) The mature\r\npollen is incoherent, and must be [word illegible] against the visiting\r\ninsect's body. I remembered this, and I find it said in my EARLY\r\nnotes that bees would never visit the flowers for pollen. This made\r\nme afterwards write to the late Dr. Cruger in the West Indies, and he\r\nobserved for me the flowers, and saw bees pressing the anthers with\r\ntheir mandibles from the base upwards, and this forced a worm-like\r\nthread of pollen from the terminal pore, and this pollen the bees\r\ncollected with their hind legs. So that the Melastomads are not opposed\r\nto your views.\r\n\r\nI am now working on the habits of worms, and it tires me much to change\r\nmy subject; so I will lay on one side your letter and my notes, until I\r\nhave a week's leisure, and will then see whether my facts bear on your\r\nviews. I will then send a letter to \"Nature\" or to the Linn. Soc., with\r\nthe extract of your letter (and this ought to appear in any case), with\r\nmy own observations, if they appear worth publishing. The subject had\r\ngone out of my mind, but I now remember thinking that the imperfect\r\naction of the crimson stamens might throw light on hybridism. If this\r\npollen is developed, according to your view, for the sake of attracting\r\ninsects, it might act imperfectly, as well as if the stamens were\r\nbecoming rudimentary. (629/2. As far as it is possible to understand the\r\nearlier letters it seems that the pollen of the shorter stamens, which\r\nare adapted for attracting insects, is the most effective.) I do not\r\nknow whether I have made myself intelligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 630. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, March 21st [1881].\r\n\r\nI have had a letter from Fritz Muller suggesting a novel and very\r\ncurious explanation of certain plants producing two sets of anthers\r\nof different colour. This has set me on fire to renew the laborious\r\nexperiments which I made on this subject, now 20 years ago. Now, will\r\nyou be so kind as to turn in your much worked and much holding head,\r\nwhether you can think of any plants, especially annuals, producing\r\n2 such sets of anthers. I believe that this is the case with Clarkia\r\nelegans, and I have just written to Thompson for seeds. The Lythraceae\r\nmust be excluded, as these are heterostyled.\r\n\r\nI have got seeds from Dr. King of some Melastomaceae, and will write\r\nto Veitch to see if I can get the Melastomaceous genera Monochaetum and\r\nHeterocentron or some such name, on which I before experimented. Now,\r\nif you can aid me, I know that you will; but if you cannot, do not write\r\nand trouble yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.X.III. CORRESPONDENCE WITH JOHN SCOTT, 1862-1871.\r\n\r\n\"If he had leisure he would make a wonderful observer, to my judgment;\r\nI have come across no one like him.\"--Letter to J.D. Hooker, May 29th\r\n[1863].\r\n\r\n\r\n(631/1. The following group of letters to John Scott, of whom some\r\naccount is given elsewhere (Volume I., Letters 150 and 151, and Index.)\r\ndeal chiefly with experimental work in the fertilisation of flowers. In\r\naddition to their scientific importance, several of the letters are\r\nof special interest as illustrating the encouragement and friendly\r\nassistance which Darwin gave to his correspondent.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 631. JOHN SCOTT TO CHARLES DARWIN. Edinburgh Botanic Gardens,\r\nNovember 11th, 1862.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of addressing you for the purpose of directing your\r\nattention to an error in one of your ingenious explanations of the\r\nstructural adaptations of the Orchidaceae in your late work. This occurs\r\nin the genus Acropera, two species of which you assume to be unisexual,\r\nand so far as known represented by male individuals only. Theoretically\r\nyou have no doubt assigned good grounds for this view; nevertheless,\r\nexperimental observations that I am now making have already convinced me\r\nof its fallacy. And I thus hurriedly, and as you may think prematurely,\r\ndirect your attention to it, before I have seen the final result of my\r\nown experiment, that you might have the longer time for reconsidering\r\nthe structure of this genus for another edition of your interesting\r\nbook, if indeed it be not already called for. I am furthermore induced\r\nto communicate the results of my yet imperfect experiments in the belief\r\nthat the actuating principle of your late work is the elicitation of\r\ntruth, and that you will gladly avail yourself of this even at the\r\nsacrifice of much ingenious theoretical argumentation.\r\n\r\nSince I have had an opportunity of perusing your work on orchid\r\nfertilisation, my attention has been particularly directed to the\r\ncuriously constructed floral organs of Acropera. I unfortunately have\r\nas yet had only a few flowers for experimental enquiry, otherwise my\r\nremarks might have been clearer and more satisfactory. Such as they are,\r\nhowever, I respectfully lay [them] before you, with a full assurance\r\nof their veracity, and I sincerely trust that as such you will receive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYour observations seem to have been chiefly directed to the A. luteola,\r\nmine to the A. Loddigesii, which, however, as you remark, is in a very\r\nsimilar constructural condition with the former; having the same narrow\r\nstigmatic chamber, abnormally developed placenta, etc. In regard to the\r\nformer point--contraction of stigmatic chamber--I may remark that\r\nit does not appear to be absolutely necessary that the pollen-masses\r\npenetrate this chamber for effecting fecundation. Thus a raceme was\r\nproduced upon a plant of A. Loddigesii in the Botanic Gardens here\r\nlately; upon this I left only six flowers. These I attempted to\r\nfertilise, but with two only of the six have I been successful: I\r\nsucceeded in forcing a single pollen-mass into the stigmatic chamber\r\nof one of the latter, but I failed to do this on the other; however, by\r\ninserting a portion of a pedicel with a pollinium attached, I caused\r\nthe latter to adhere, with a gentle press, to the mouth of the stigmatic\r\nchamber. Both of these, as I have already remarked, are nevertheless\r\nfertilised; one of them I have cut off for examination, and its\r\ncondition I will presently describe; the other is still upon the plant,\r\nand promises fair to attain maturity. In regard to the other four\r\nflowers, I may remark that though similarly fertilised--part having\r\npollinia inserted, others merely attached--they all withered and dropped\r\noff without the least swelling of the ovary. Can it be, then, that this\r\nis really an [andro-monoecious] species?--part of the flowers male,\r\nothers truly hermaphrodite.\r\n\r\nIn making longitudinal sections of the fertilised ovary before\r\nmentioned, I found the basal portion entirely destitute of ovules, their\r\nplace being substituted by transparent cellular ramification of the\r\nplacentae. As I traced the placentae upwards, the ovules appeared,\r\nbecoming gradually more abundant towards its apex. A transverse section\r\nnear the apex of the ovary, however, still exhibited a more than\r\nordinary placental development--i.e. [congenitally?] considered--each\r\nend giving off two branches, which meet each other in the centre of the\r\novary, the ovules being irregularly and sparingly disposed upon their\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the mere question of fertilisation, then, I am perfectly\r\nsatisfied, but there are other points which require further elucidation.\r\nAmong these I may particularly refer to the contracted stigmatic\r\nchamber, and the slight viscidity of its disk. The latter, however,\r\nmay be a consequence of uncongenial conditions--as you do not mention\r\nparticularly its examination by any author in its natural habitat. If\r\nsuch be the case, the contracted stigmatic chamber will offer no real\r\ndifficulty, should the viscous exudations be only sufficient to render\r\nthe mouth adhesive. For, as I have already shown, the pollen-tubes may\r\nbe emitted in this condition, and effect fecundation without being in\r\nactual contact with the stigmatic surface, as occurs pretty regularly in\r\nthe fertilisation of the Stapelias, for example. But, indeed, your\r\nown discovery of the independent germinative capabilities of the\r\npollen-grains of certain Orchidaceae is sufficiently illustrative of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI may also refer to the peculiar abnormal condition that many at least\r\nof the ovaries present in a comparative examination of the placentae,\r\nand of which I beg to suggest the following explanation, though it is as\r\nyet founded on limited observations. In examining certain young ovaries\r\nof A. Loddigesii, I found some of them filled with the transparent\r\nmembranous fringes of more or less distinctly cellular matter, which,\r\nfrom your description of the ovaries of luteola, appears to differ\r\nsimply in the greater development in the former species. Again, in\r\nothers I found small mammillary bodies, which appeared to be true\r\novules, though I could not perfectly satisfy myself as to the existence\r\nof the micropyle or nucleus. I unfortunately neglected to apply any\r\nchemical test. The fact, however, that in certain of the examined\r\novaries few or none of the latter bodies occurred--the placenta alone\r\nbeing developed in an irregular membranous form, taken in conjunction\r\nwith the results of my experiments--before alluded to--on their\r\nfertilisation, leads me to infer that two sexual conditions are\r\npresented by the flowers of this plant. In short, that many of the\r\novaries are now normally abortive, though Nature occasionally makes\r\nfutile efforts for their perfect development, in the production of\r\novuloid bodies; these then I regard as the male flowers. The others that\r\nare still capable of fertilisation, and likewise possessing male\r\norgans, are hermaphrodite, and must, I think, from the results of your\r\ncomparative examinations, present a somewhat different condition; as it\r\ncan scarcely be supposed that ovules in the condition you describe could\r\never be fertilised.\r\n\r\nThis is at least the most plausible explanation I can offer for the\r\ndifferent results in my experiments on the fertilisation of apparently\r\nsimilar morphologically constructed flowers; others may, however, occur\r\nto you. Here there is not, as in the Catasetum, any external change\r\nvisible in the respective unisexual and bisexual flowers. And yet it\r\nwould appear from your researches that the ovules of Acropera are in a\r\nmore highly atrophied condition than occurs in Catasetum, though, as\r\nyou likewise remark, M. Neumann has never succeeded in fertilising C.\r\ntridentatum. If there be not, then, an arrangement of the reproductive\r\nstructures, such as I have indicated, how can the different results in\r\nM. Neumann's experiments and mine be accounted for? However, as you\r\nhave examined many flowers of both A. luteola and Loddigesii, such a\r\ndifference in the ovulary or placental structures could scarcely\r\nhave escaped your observation. But, be this as it may, the--to me at\r\nleast--demonstrated fact still remains, that certain flowers of A.\r\nLoddigesii are capable of fertilisation, and that, though there are good\r\ngrounds for supposing that important physiological changes are going on\r\nin the sexual phenomena of this species, there is no evidence whatever\r\nfor supposing that external morphological changes have so masked certain\r\nindividuals as to prevent their recognition.\r\n\r\nI would now, sir, in conclusion beg you to excuse me for this\r\ninfringement upon your valuable time, as I have been induced to\r\nwrite you in the belief that you have had negative results from\r\nother experimenters, before you ventured to propose your theoretical\r\nexplanation, and consequently that you have been unknowingly led into\r\nerror. I will continue, as opportunities present themselves, to examine\r\nthe many peculiarities you have pointed out in this as well as others of\r\nthe Orchid family; and at present I am looking forward with anxiety for\r\nthe maturation of the ovary of A. Loddigesii, which will bear testimony\r\nto the veracity of the remarks I have ventured to lay before you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 632. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 18th [November 1862].\r\n\r\nStrange to say, I have only one little bother for you to-day, and that\r\nis to let me know about what month flowers appear in Acropera Loddigesii\r\nand luteola; for I want extremely to beg a few more flowers, and if I\r\nknew the time I would keep a memorandum to remind you. Why I want these\r\nflowers is (and I am much alarmed) that Mr. J. Scott, of Bot. Garden of\r\nEdinburgh (do you know anything of him?) has written me a very long and\r\nclever letter, in which he confirms most of my observations; but tells\r\nme that with much difficulty he managed to get pollen into orifice, or\r\nas far as mouth of orifice, of six flowers of A. Loddigesii (the ovarium\r\nof which I did not examine), and two pods set; one he gathered, and saw\r\na very few ovules, as he thinks, on the large and mostly rudimentary\r\nplacenta. I shall be most curious to hear whether the other pod produces\r\na good lot of seed. He says he regrets that he did not test the ovules\r\nwith chemical agents: does he mean tincture of iodine? He suggests that\r\nin a state of nature the viscid matter may come to the very surface of\r\nstigmatic chamber, and so pollen-masses need not be inserted. This is\r\npossible, but I should think improbable. Altogether the case is very\r\nodd, and I am very uneasy, for I cannot hope that A. Loddigesii is\r\nhermaphrodite and A. luteola the male of the same species. Whenever I\r\ncan get Acropera would be a very good time for me to look at Vanda in\r\nspirits, which you so kindly preserved for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 633. TO J. SCOTT.\r\n\r\n(633/1. The following is Darwin's reply to the above letter from Scott.\r\nIn the first edition of \"Fertilisation of Orchids\" (page 209) he assumed\r\nthat the sexes in Acropera, as in Catasetum, were separate. In the\r\nsecond edition (page 172) he writes: \"I was, however, soon convinced\r\nof my error by Mr. Scott, who succeeded in artificially fertilising\r\nthe flowers with their own pollen. A remarkable discovery by Hildebrand\r\n(633/2. \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1863 and 1865.), namely, that in many orchids\r\nthe ovules are not developed unless the stigma is penetrated by the\r\npollen-tubes...explains the state of the ovarium in Acropera, as\r\nobserved by me.\" In regard to this subject see Letter 608.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 12th, 1862.\r\n\r\nI thank you most sincerely for your kindness in writing to me, and for\r\n[your] very interesting letter. Your fact has surprised me greatly, and\r\nhas alarmed me not a little, for if I am in error about Acropera I may\r\nbe in error about Catasetum. Yet when I call to mind the state of\r\nthe placentae in A. luteola, I am astonished that they should produce\r\novules. You will see in my book that I state that I did not look at the\r\novarium of A. Loddigesii. Would you have the kindness to send me word\r\nwhich end of the ovarium is meant by apex (that nearest the flower?),\r\nfor I must try and get this species from Kew and look at its ovarium.\r\nI shall be extremely curious to hear whether the fruit, which is now\r\nmaturing, produces a large number of good and plump seed; perhaps you\r\nmay have seen the ripe capsules of other Vandeae, and may be able\r\nto form some conjecture what it ought to produce. In the young,\r\nunfertilised ovaria of many Vandeae there seemed an infinitude of\r\novules. In desperation it occurs to me as just possible, as almost\r\neverything in nature goes by gradation, that a properly male flower\r\nmight occasionally produce a few seeds, in the same manner as female\r\nplants sometimes produce a little pollen. All your remarks seem to me\r\nexcellent and very interesting, and I again thank you for your kindness\r\nin writing to me. I am pleased to observe that my description of the\r\nstructure of Acropera seems to agree pretty well with what you have\r\nobserved. Does it not strike you as very difficult to understand\r\nhow insects remove the pollinia and carry them to the stigmas? Your\r\nsuggestion that the mouth of the stigmatic cavity may become charged\r\nwith viscid matter and thus secure the pollinia, and that the\r\npollen-tubes may then protrude, seems very ingenious and new to me; but\r\nit would be very anomalous in orchids, i.e. as far as I have seen. No\r\ndoubt, however, though I tried my best, I shall be proved wrong in many\r\npoints. Botany is a new subject to me. With respect to the protrusion\r\nof pollen-tubes, you might like to hear (if you do not already know the\r\nfact) that, as I saw this summer, in the little imperfect flowers of\r\nViola and Oxalis, which never open, the pollen-tubes always come out of\r\nthe pollen-grain, whilst still in the anthers, and direct themselves in\r\na beautiful manner to the stigma seated at some little distance. I hope\r\nthat you will continue your very interesting observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 634. TO J. SCOTT. Down, November 19th [1862].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your letter, which is full of interesting matter.\r\nI shall be very glad to look at the capsule of the Acropera when\r\nripe, and pray present my thanks to Mr. MacNab. (634/1. See Letter 608\r\n(Lindley, December 15th, 1861). Also \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition\r\nII., page 172, for an account of the observations on Acropera which were\r\ncorrected by Scott.) I should like to keep it till I could get a capsule\r\nof some other member of the Vandeae for comparison, but ultimately all\r\nthe seeds shall be returned, in case you would like to write any\r\nnotice on the subject. It was, as I said (634/2. Letter 633.), only\r\n\"in desperation\" that I suggested that the flower might be a male and\r\noccasionally capable of producing a few seeds. I had forgotten Gartner's\r\nremark; in fact, I know only odds and ends of Botany, and you know far\r\nmore. One point makes the above view more probable in Acropera than in\r\nother cases, viz. the presence of rudimentary placentae or testae, for\r\nI cannot hear that these have been observed in the male plants. They do\r\nnot occur in male Lychnis dioica, but next spring I will look to male\r\nholly flowers. I fully admit the difficulty of similarity of stigmatic\r\nchamber in the two Acroperas. As far as I remember, the blunt end of\r\npollen-mass would not easily even stick in the orifice of the chamber.\r\nYour view may be correct about abundance of viscid matter, but seems\r\nrather improbable. Your facts about female flowers occurring where males\r\nalone ought to occur is new to me; if I do not hear that you object, I\r\nwill quote the Zea case on your authority in what I am now writing on\r\nthe varieties of the maize. (634/3. See \"Animals and Plants,\" Edition\r\nII., Volume I., page 339: \"Mr. Scott has lately observed the rarer case\r\nof female flowers on a true male panicle, and likewise hermaphrodite\r\nflowers.\" Scott's paper on the subject is in \"Trans. Bot. Soc.\r\nEdinburgh,\" Volume VIII. See Letter 151, Volume I.) I am glad to hear\r\nthat you are now working on the most curious subject of parthenogenesis.\r\nI formerly fancied that I observed female Lychnis dioica seeded without\r\npollen. I send by this post a paper on Primula, which may interest you.\r\n(634/4. \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" 1862.) I am working on the subject, and if\r\nyou should ever observe any analogous case I should be glad to hear. I\r\nhave added another very clever pamphlet by Prof. Asa Gray. Have you a\r\ncopy of my Orchis book? If you have not, and would like one, I should be\r\npleased to send one. I plainly see that you have the true spirit of an\r\nexperimentalist and good observer. Therefore, I ask whether you have\r\never made any trials on relative fertility of varieties of plants (like\r\nthose I quote from Gartner on the varieties of Verbascum). I much\r\nwant information on this head, and on those marvellous cases (as some\r\nLobelias and Crinum passiflora) in which a plant can be more easily\r\nfertilised by the pollen of another species than by its own good pollen.\r\nI am compelled to write in haste. With many thanks for your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 635. TO J. SCOTT. Down, 20th [1862?].\r\n\r\nWhat a magnificent capsule, and good Heavens, what a number of seeds!\r\nI never before opened pods of larger orchids. It did not signify a\r\nfew seed being lost, as it would be hopeless to estimate number in\r\ncomparison with other species. If you sow any, had you not better sow\r\na good many? so I enclose small packet. I have looked at the seeds; I\r\nnever saw in the British orchids nearly so many empty testae; but\r\nthis goes for nothing, as unnatural conditions would account for it. I\r\nsuspect, however, from the variable size and transparency, that a\r\ngood many of the seeds when dry (and I have put the capsule on my\r\nchimney-piece) will shrivel up. So I will wait a month or two till I get\r\nthe capsule of some large Vandeae for comparison. It is more likely that\r\nI have made some dreadful blunder about Acropera than that it should be\r\nmale yet not a perfect male. May there be some sexual relation between\r\nA. Loddigesii and luteola; they seem very close? I should very much like\r\nto examine the capsule of the unimpregnated flower of A. Loddigesii.\r\nI have got both species from Kew, but whether we shall have skill to\r\nflower them I know not. One conjectures that it is imperfect male; I\r\nstill should incline to think it would produce by seed both sexes.\r\nBut you are right about Primula (and a very acute thought it was):\r\nthe long-styled P. sinensis, homomorphically fertilised with own-form\r\npollen, has produced during two successive homomorphic generations only\r\nlong-styled plants. (635/1. In \"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page\r\n216, a summary of the transmission of forms in the \"homomorphic\" unions\r\nof P. sinensis is given. Darwin afterwards used \"illegitimate\" for\r\nhomomorphic, and \"legitimate\" for \"heteromorphic\" (\"Forms of Flowers,\"\r\nEdition i., page 24).) The short-styled the same, i.e. produced\r\nshort-styled for two generations with the exception of a single plant.\r\nI cannot say about cowslips yet. I should like to hear your case of the\r\nPrimula: is it certainly propagated by seed?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 636. TO J. SCOTT. Down, December 3rd, [1862?].\r\n\r\nWhat a capital observer you are! and how well you have worked the\r\nprimulas. All your facts are new to me. It is likely that I overrate the\r\ninterest of the subject; but it seems to me that you ought to publish a\r\npaper on the subject. It would, however, greatly add to the value if you\r\nwere to cover up any of the forms having pistil and anther of the same\r\nheight, and prove that they were fully self-fertile. The occurrence of\r\ndimorphic and non-dimorphic species in the same genus is quite the\r\nsame as I find in Linum. (636/1. Darwin finished his paper on Linum\r\nin December 1862, and it was published in the \"Linn. Soc. Journal\" in\r\n1863.) Have any of the forms of Primula, which are non-dimorphic, been\r\npropagated for some little time by seed in garden? I suppose not. I\r\nask because I find in P. sinensis a third rather fluctuating form,\r\napparently due to culture, with stigma and anthers of same height.\r\nI have been working successive generations homomorphically of this\r\nPrimula, and think I am getting curious results; I shall probably\r\npublish next autumn; and if you do not (but I hope you will) publish\r\nyourself previously, I should be glad to quote in abstract some of your\r\nfacts. But I repeat that I hope you will yourself publish. Hottonia is\r\ndimorphic, with pollen of very different sizes in the two forms. I think\r\nyou are mistaken about Siphocampylus, but I feel rather doubtful in\r\nsaying this to so good an observer. In Lobelia the closed pistil grows\r\nrapidly, and pushes out the pollen and then the stigma expands, and the\r\nflower in function is monoecious; from appearance I believe this is the\r\ncase with your plant. I hope it is so, for this plant can hardly require\r\na cross, being in function monoecious; so that dimorphism in such a case\r\nwould be a heavy blow to understanding its nature or good in all other\r\ncases. I see few periodicals: when have you published on Clivia? I\r\nsuppose that you did not actually count the seeds in the hybrids in\r\ncomparison with those of the parent-forms; but this is almost necessary\r\nafter Gartner's observations. I very much hope you will make a good\r\nseries of comparative trials on the same plant of Tacsonia. (636/2. See\r\nScott in \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" VIII.) I have raised 700-800 seedlings\r\nfrom cowslips, artificially fertilised with care; and they presented not\r\na hair's-breadth approach to oxlips. I have now seed in pots of cowslip\r\nfertilised by pollen of primrose, and I hope they will grow; I have also\r\ngot fine seedlings from seed of wild oxlips; so I hope to make out the\r\ncase. You speak of difficulties on Natural Selection: there are indeed\r\nplenty; if ever you have spare time (which is not likely, as I am sure\r\nyou must be a hard worker) I should be very glad to hear difficulties\r\nfrom one who has observed so much as you have. The majority of\r\ncriticisms on the \"Origin\" are, in my opinion, not worth the paper they\r\nare printed on. Sir C. Lyell is coming out with what, I expect, will\r\nprove really good remarks. (636/3. Lyell's \"Antiquity of Man\" was\r\npublished in the spring of 1863. In the \"Life and Letters,\" Volume III.,\r\npages 8, 11, Darwin's correspondence shows his deep disappointment at\r\nwhat he thought Lyell's half-heartedness in regard to evolution. See\r\nLetter 164, Volume I.) Pray do not think me intrusive; but if you\r\nwould like to have any book I have published, such as my \"Journal of\r\nResearches\" or the \"Origin,\" I should esteem it a compliment to be\r\nallowed to send it. Will you permit me to suggest one experiment, which\r\nI should much like to see tried, and which I now wish the more from\r\nan extraordinary observation by Asa Gray on Gymnadenia tridentata (in\r\nnumber just out of Silliman's N. American Journal) (636/4. In Gymnadenia\r\ntridentata, according to Asa Gray, the anther opens in the bud, and the\r\npollen being somewhat coherent falls on the stigma and on the rostellum\r\nwhich latter is penetrated by the pollen-tubes. \"Fertilisation of\r\nOrchids,\" Edition II., page 68. Asa Gray's papers are in \"American\r\nJournal of Science,\" Volume XXXIV., 1862, and XXXVI., 1863.); namely,\r\nto split the labellum of a Cattleya, or of some allied orchis, remove\r\ncaudicle from pollen-mass (so that no loose grains are about) and put it\r\ncarefully into the large tongue-like rostellum, and see if pollen-tubes\r\nwill penetrate, or better, see if capsule will swell. Similar\r\npollen-masses ought to be put on true stigmas of two or three other\r\nflowers of same plants for comparison. It is to discover whether\r\nrostellum yet retains some of its primordial function of being\r\npenetrated by pollen-tubes. You will be sorry that you ever entered\r\ninto correspondence with me. But do not answer till at leisure, and as\r\nbriefly as you like. My handwriting, I know, is dreadfully bad. Excuse\r\nthis scribbling paper, as I can write faster on it, and I have a rather\r\nlarge correspondence to keep up.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 637. TO J. SCOTT. Down, January 21st, 1863.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very interesting letter; I must answer as briefly\r\nas I can, for I have a heap of other letters to answer. I strongly\r\nadvise you to follow up and publish your observations on the\r\npollen-tubes of orchids; they promise to be very interesting. If you\r\ncould prove what I only conjectured (from state of utriculi in rostellum\r\nand in stigma of Catasetum and Acropera) that the utriculi somehow\r\ninduce, or are correlated with, penetration of pollen-tubes you will\r\nmake an important physiological discovery. I will mention, as worth\r\nyour attention (and what I have anxiously wished to observe, if time had\r\npermitted, and still hope to do)--viz., the state of tissues or cells\r\nof stigma in an utterly sterile hybrid, in comparison with the same\r\nin fertile parent species; to test these cells, immerse stigmas for\r\n48 hours in spirits of wine. I should expect in hybrids that the cells\r\nwould not show coagulated contents. It would be an interesting discovery\r\nto show difference in female organs of hybrids and pure species. Anyhow,\r\nit is worth trial, and I recommend you to make it, and publish if\r\nyou do. The pollen-tubes directing themselves to stigma is also very\r\ncurious, though not quite so new, but well worth investigation when\r\nyou get Cattleya, etc., in flower. I say not so new, for remember small\r\nflowers of Viola and Oxalis; or better, see Bibliography in \"Natural\r\nHistory Review,\" No. VIII., page 419 (October, 1862) for quotation\r\nfrom M. Baillon on pollen-tubes finding way from anthers to stigma in\r\nHelianthemum. I should doubt gum getting solid from [i.e. because of]\r\ncontinued secretion. Why not sprinkle fresh plaster of Paris and make\r\nimpenetrable crust? (637/1. The suggestion that the stigma should be\r\ncovered with a crust of plaster of Paris, pierced by a hole to allow the\r\npollen-tubes to enter, bears a resemblance to Miyoshi's experiments with\r\ngerminating pollen and fungal spores. See \"Pringsheim's Jahrbucher,\"\r\n1895; \"Flora,\" 1894.) You might modify experiment by making little hole\r\nin one lower corner, and see if tubes find it out. See in my future\r\npaper on Linum pollen and stigma recognising each other. If you will\r\ntell me that pollen smells the stigma I will try and believe you; but\r\nI will not believe the Frenchman (I forget who) who says that stigma of\r\nVanilla actually attracts mechanically, by some unknown force, the solid\r\npollen-masses to it! Read Asa Gray in 2nd Review of my Orchis book on\r\npollen of Gymnadenia penetrating rostellum. I can, if you like, lend\r\nyou these Reviews; but they must be returned. R. Brown, I remember, says\r\npollen-tubes separate from grains before the lower ends of tubes reach\r\novules. I saw, and was interested by, abstract of your Drosera paper\r\n(637/2. A short note on the irritability of Drosera in the \"Trans. Bot.\r\nSoc. Edin.\" Volume VII.); we have been at very much the same work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 638. TO J. SCOTT. Down, February 16th [1863].\r\n\r\nAbsence from home has prevented me from answering you sooner. I should\r\nthink that the capsule of Acropera had better be left till it shows some\r\nsigns of opening, as our object is to judge whether the seeds are good;\r\nbut I should prefer trusting to your better judgment. I am interested\r\nabout the Gongora, which I hope hereafter to try myself, as I have just\r\nbuilt a small hot-house.\r\n\r\nAsa Gray's observations on the rostellum of Gymnadenia are very\r\nimperfect, yet worth looking at. Your case of Imatophyllum is most\r\ninteresting (638/1. A sucker of Imatophyllum minatum threw up a shoot\r\nin which the leaves were \"two-ranked instead of four-ranked,\" and showed\r\nother differences from the normal.--\"Animals and Plants,\" Edition II.,\r\nVolume I., page 411.); even if the sport does not flower it will be\r\nworth my giving. I did not understand, or I had forgotten, that a single\r\nfrond on a fern will vary; I now see that the case does come under\r\nbud-variation, and must be given by me. I had thought of it only\r\nas proof [of] inheritance in cryptogams; I am much obliged for your\r\ncorrection, and will consult again your paper and Mr. Bridgeman's.\r\n(638/2. The facts are given in \"Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume\r\nI., page 408.) I enclose varieties of maize from Asa Gray. Pray do not\r\nthank me for trusting you; the thanks ought to go the other way. I\r\nfelt a conviction after your first letter that you were a real lover of\r\nNatural History.\r\n\r\nIf you can advance good evidence showing that bisexual plants are more\r\nvariable than unisexual, it will be interesting. I shall be very glad to\r\nread the discussion which you are preparing. I admit as fully as any\r\none can do that cross-impregnation is the great check to endless\r\nvariability; but I am not sure that I understand your view. I do not\r\nbelieve that the structure of Primula has any necessary relation to\r\na tendency to a dioecious structure, but seeing the difference in the\r\nfertility of the two forms, I felt bound unwillingly to admit that they\r\nmight be a step towards dioeciousness; I allude to this subject in\r\nmy Linum paper. (638/3. \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" 1863.) Thanks for your\r\nanswers to my other queries. I forgot to say that I was at Kew the other\r\nday, and I find that they can give me capsules of several Vandeae.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 639. TO J. SCOTT. Down, March 24th [1863].\r\n\r\nYour letter, as every one you have written, has greatly interested me.\r\nIf you can show that certain individual Passifloras, under certain known\r\nor unknown conditions of life, have stigmas capable of fertilisation\r\nby pollen from another species, or from another individual of its own\r\nspecies, yet not by its own individual pollen (its own individual pollen\r\nbeing proved to be good by its action on some other species), you will\r\nadd a case of great interest to me; and which in my opinion would be\r\nquite worth your publication. (639/1. Cases nearly similar to those\r\nobserved by Scott were recorded by Gartner and Kolreuter, but in these\r\ninstances only certain individuals were self-impotent. In \"Animals and\r\nPlants,\" Edition II., Volume II., page 114, where the phenomenon is\r\nfully discussed, Scott's observations (\"Trans. Bot. Soc. Edin.\" 1863)\r\nare given as the earliest, except for one case recorded by Lecoq\r\n(\"Fecondation,\" 1862). Interesting work was afterwards done by\r\nHildebrand and Fritz Muller, as illustrated in many of the letters\r\naddressed to the latter.) I always imagined that such recorded cases\r\nmust be due to unnatural conditions of life; and think I said so in the\r\n\"Origin.\" (639/2. See \"Origin of Species,\" Edition I., page 251, for\r\nHerbert's observations on self-impotence in Hippeastrum. In spite of\r\nthe uniformness of the results obtained in many successive years, Darwin\r\ninferred that the plants must have been in an \"unnatural state.\") I am\r\nnot sure that I understand your result, [nor] whether it means what I\r\nhave above obscurely expressed. If you can prove the above, do publish;\r\nbut if you will not publish I earnestly beg you to let me have the facts\r\nin detail; but you ought to publish, for I may not use the facts for\r\nyears. I have been much interested by what you say on the rostellum\r\nexciting pollen to protrude tubes; but are you sure that the rostellum\r\ndoes excite them? Would not tubes protrude if placed on parts of column\r\nor base of petals, etc., near to the stigma? Please look at the\r\n\"Cottage Gardener\" (or \"Journal of Horticulture\") (639/3. \"Journal of\r\nHorticulture\" and \"Cottage Gardener,\" March 31st, 1863. A short note\r\ndescribing Cruger's discovery of self-fertilisation in Cattleya,\r\nEpidendrum, etc., and referring to the work of \"an excellent observer,\r\nMr. J. Scott.\" Darwin adds that he is convinced that he has underrated\r\nthe power of tropical orchids occasionally to produce seeds without the\r\naid of insects.) to be published to-morrow week for letter of mine, in\r\nwhich I venture to quote you, and in which you will see a curious fact\r\nabout unopened orchid flowers setting seed in West Indies. Dr. Cruger\r\nattributes protrusion of tubes to ants carrying stigmatic secretion to\r\npollen (639/4. In Cruger's paper (\"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" VIII., 1865; read\r\nMarch 3rd 1864) he speaks of the pollen-masses in situ being acted on by\r\nthe stigmatic secretion, but no mention is made of the agency of ants.\r\nHe describes the pollen-tubes descending \"from the [pollen] masses still\r\nin situ down into the ovarian canal.\"); but this is mere hypothesis.\r\nRemember, pollen-tubes protrude within anther in Neottia nidus-avis. I\r\ndid think it possible or probable that perfect fertilisation might have\r\nbeen effected through rostellum. What a curious case your Gongora must\r\nbe: could you spare me one of the largest capsules? I want to estimate\r\nthe number of seed, and try my hand if I can make them grow. This,\r\nhowever, is a foolish attempt, for Dr. Hooker, who was here a day or two\r\nago, says they cannot at Calcutta, and yet imported species have seeded\r\nand have naturally spread on to the adjoining trees! Dr. Cruger thinks I\r\nam wrong about Catasetum: but I cannot understand his letter. He admits\r\nthere are three forms in two species; and he speaks as if the sexes\r\nwere separate in some and that others were hermaphrodites (639/5.\r\nCruger (\"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" VIII., page 127) says that the apparently\r\nhermaphrodite form is always sterile in Trinidad. Darwin modified\r\nhis account in the second edition of the orchid book.); but I cannot\r\nunderstand what he means. He has seen lots of great humble-bees buzzing\r\nabout the flowers with the pollinia sticking to their backs! Happy man!!\r\nI have the promise, but not yet surety, of some curious results with\r\nmy homomorphic seedling cowslips: these have not followed the rule of\r\nChinese Primula; homomorphic seedlings from short-styled parent have\r\npresented both forms, which disgusts me.\r\n\r\nYou will see that I am better; but still I greatly fear that I must have\r\na compulsory holiday. With sincere thanks and hearty admiration at your\r\npowers of observation...\r\n\r\nMy poor P. scotica looks very sick which you so kindly sent me. (639/6.\r\nSent by Scott, January 6th, 1863.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 640. TO J. SCOTT. April 12th [1863].\r\n\r\nI really hardly know how to thank you enough for your very interesting\r\nletter. I shall certainly use all the facts which you have given me (in\r\na condensed form) on the sterility of orchids in the work which I am now\r\nslowly preparing for publication. But why do you not publish these facts\r\nin a separate little paper? (640/1. See Letter 642, note, for reference\r\nto Scott's paper.) They seem to me well worth it, and you really ought\r\nto get your name known. I could equally well use them in my book. I\r\nearnestly hope that you will experiment on Passiflora, and let me give\r\nyour results. Dr. A. Gray's observations were made loosely; he said in\r\na letter he would attend this summer further to the case, which clearly\r\nsurprised him much. I will say nothing about the rostellum, stigmatic\r\nutriculi, fertility of Acropera and Catasetum, for I am completely\r\nbewildered: it will rest with you to settle these points by your\r\nexcellent observations and experiments. I must own I never could help\r\ndoubting Dr. Hooker's case of the poppy. You may like to hear what I\r\nhave seen this morning: I found (640/2. See Letter 658.) a primrose\r\nplant with flowers having three pistils, which when pulled asunder,\r\nwithout any tearing, allowed pollen to be placed on ovules. This I did\r\nwith three flowers--pollen-tubes did not protrude after several days.\r\nBut this day, the sixteenth (N.B.--primulas seem naturally slowly\r\nfertilised), I found many tubes protruded, and, what is very odd, they\r\ncertainly seemed to have penetrated the coats of the ovules, but in\r\nno one instance the foramen of the ovule!! I mention this because\r\nit directly bears on your explanation of Dr. Cruger's case. (640/3.\r\nCruger's case here referred to is doubtless the cleistogamic\r\nfertilisation of Epidendrum, etc. Scott discusses the question of\r\nself-fertilisation at great length in a letter to Darwin dated April,\r\nand obviously written in 1863. In Epidendrum he observed a viscid matter\r\nextending from the stigmatic chamber to the anther: pollen-tubes had\r\nprotruded from the anther not only where it was in contact with the\r\nviscid matter, but also from the central part, and these spread \"over\r\nthe anterior surface of the rostellum downward into the stigma.\" Cruger\r\nbelieved the viscid matter reaching the anther was a necessary condition\r\nfor the germination of the pollen-grains. Scott points out that the\r\nviscid matter is produced in large quantity only after the pollen-grains\r\nhave penetrated the stigma, and that it is, in fact, a consequence, not\r\na preliminary to fertilisation. He finally explains Cruger's case thus:\r\n\"The greater humidity and equability of temperature consequent on\r\nsuch conditions [i.e. on the flowers being closed] is, I believe, the\r\nprobable cause of these abnormally conditioned flowers so frequently\r\nfertilising themselves.\" Scott also calls attention to the danger\r\nof being deceived by fungal hyphae in observations on germination of\r\npollen.) I believe that your explanation is right; I should never have\r\nthought of it; yet this was stupid of me, for I remember thinking that\r\nthe almost closed imperfect flowers of Viola and Oxalis were related\r\nto the protrusion of the pollen-tubes. My case of the Aceras with the\r\naborted labellum squeezed against stigma supports your view. (640/4. See\r\n\"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page 258: the pollen germinated\r\nwithin the anther of a monstrous flower.) Dr. Cruger's notion about the\r\nants was a simple conjecture. About cryptogamic filaments, remember Dr.\r\nC. says that the unopened flowers habitually set fruit. I think that you\r\nwill change your views on the imperfect flowers of Viola and Oxalis...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 641. (?)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 642. TO J. SCOTT. May 2nd [1863].\r\n\r\nI have left home for a fortnight to see if I can, with little hope,\r\nimprove my health. The parcel of orchid pods, which you have so kindly\r\nsent me, has followed me. I am sure you will forgive the liberty which I\r\ntake in returning you the postage stamps. I never heard of such a scheme\r\nas that you were compelled to practise to fertilise the Gongora! (642/1.\r\nSee \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition, II., page 169. \"Mr. Scott tried\r\nrepeatedly, but in vain, to force the pollen-masses into the stigma of\r\nGongora atro-purpurea and truncata; but he readily fertilised them by\r\ncutting off the clinandrum and placing pollen-masses on the now exposed\r\nstigma.\") It is a most curious problem what plan Nature follows in this\r\ngenus and Acropera. (642/2. In the \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition\r\nII., page 169, Darwin speculates as to the possible fertilisation of\r\nAcropera by an insect with pollen-masses adhering to the extremity of\r\nits abdomen. It would appear that this guess (which does not occur in\r\nthe first edition) was made before he heard of Cruger's observation on\r\nthe allied genus Gongora, which is visited by a bee with a long tongue,\r\nwhich projects, when not in use, beyond and above the tip of the\r\nabdomen. Cruger believes that this tongue is the pollinating agent.\r\nCruger's account is in the \"Journal of the Linn. Soc.\" VIII., 1865,\r\npage 130.) Some day I will try and estimate how many seeds there are in\r\nGongora. I suppose and hope you have kept notes on all your observations\r\non orchids, for, with my broken health and many other subjects, I do not\r\nknow whether I shall ever have time to publish again; though I have a\r\nlarge collection of notes and facts ready. I think you show your wisdom\r\nin not wishing to publish too soon; a young author who publishes every\r\ntrifle gets, sometimes unjustly, to be disregarded. I do not pretend\r\nto be much of a judge; but I can conscientiously say that I have never\r\nwritten one word to you on the merit of your letters that I do not fully\r\nbelieve in. Please remember that I should very much wish for a copy of\r\nyour paper on sterility of individual orchids (642/3. \"On the Individual\r\nSterility and Cross-Impregnation of Certain Species of Oncidium.\" [Read\r\nJune 2nd, 1864.] \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" VIII., 1865. This paper gives a\r\nfull account of the self-sterility of Oncidium in cases where the pollen\r\nwas efficient in fertilising other individuals of the same species and\r\nof distinct species. Some of the facts were given in Scott's paper,\r\n\"Experiments on the Fertilisation of Orchids in the Royal Botanic Garden\r\nof Edinburgh,\" published in the \"Proc. Bot. Soc. Edinb.\" 1863. It\r\nis probably to the latter paper that Darwin refers.) and on Drosera.\r\n(642/4. \"Trans. Bot. Soc. Edinburgh,\" Volume VII.) Thanks for [note]\r\nabout Campanula perfoliata. I have asked Asa Gray for seeds, to whom\r\nI have mentioned your observations on rostellum, and asked him to\r\nlook closer to the case of Gymnadenia. (642/5. See \"Fertilisation\r\nof Orchids,\" Edition II., page 68.) Let me hear about the sporting\r\nImatophyllum if it flowers. Perhaps I have blundered about Primula; but\r\ncertainly not about mere protrusion of pollen-tubes. I have been idly\r\nwatching bees of several genera and diptera fertilising O. morio at this\r\nplace, and it is a very pretty sight. I have confirmed in several ways\r\nthe entire truth of my statement that there is no vestige of nectar in\r\nthe spur; but the insects perforate the inner coat. This seems to me a\r\ncurious little fact, which none of my reviewers have noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 643. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 23rd [1863].\r\n\r\nYou can confer a real service on a good man, John Scott, the writer of\r\nthe enclosed letter, by reading it and giving me your opinion. I assure\r\n[you] John Scott is a truly remarkable man. The part struck out is\r\nmerely that he is not comfortable under Mr. McNab, and this part must be\r\nconsidered as private. Now the question is, what think you of the offer?\r\nIs expense of living high at Darjeeling? May I say it is healthy? Will\r\nhe find the opportunity for experimental observations, which are a\r\npassion with him? It seems to me rather low pay. Will you advise me for\r\nhim? I shall say that as far as experiments in hand at the Botanical\r\nGarden in Edinburgh are concerned, it would be a pity to hesitate to\r\naccept the offer.\r\n\r\nJ. Scott is head of the propagating department. I know you will not\r\ngrudge aiding by your advice a good man. I shall tell him that I have\r\nnot the slightest power to aid him in any way for the appointment. I\r\nshould think voyage out and home ought to be paid for?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 644. TO JOHN SCOTT. Down, May 25th, 1863.\r\n\r\nNow for a few words on science. I do not think I could be mistaken about\r\nthe stigma of Bolbophyllum (644/1. Bolbophyllum is remarkable for the\r\nclosure of the stigmatic cavity which comes on after the flower has been\r\nopen a little while, instead of after fertilisation, as in other genera.\r\nDarwin connects the fact with the \"exposed condition of the whole\r\nflower.\"--\"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page 137.); I had\r\nthe plant alive from Kew, and watched many flowers. That is a most\r\nremarkable observation on foreign pollen emitting tubes, but not causing\r\norifice to close (644/2. See Scott, \"Bot. Soc. Edin.\" 1863, page 546,\r\nnote. He applied pollinia from Cypripedium and Asclepias to flowers of\r\nTricopilia tortilis; and though the pollen germinated, the stigmatic\r\nchamber remained open, yet it invariably closes eighteen hours after the\r\napplication of its own pollen.); it would have been interesting to have\r\nobserved how close an alliance of form would have acted on the orifice\r\nof the stigma. It will probably be so many years, if ever, [before] I\r\nwork up my observations on Drosera, that I will not trouble you to send\r\nyour paper, for I could not now find time to read it. If you have spare\r\ncopy of your Orchid paper, please send it, but do not get a copy of the\r\njournal, for I can get one, and you must often want to buy books. Let me\r\nknow when it is published. I have been glad to hear about Mercurialis,\r\nbut I will not accept your offer of seed on account of time, time, time,\r\nand weak health. For the same reason I must give up Primula mollis.\r\nWhat a wonderful, indefatigable worker you are! You seem to have made a\r\nfamous lot of interesting experiments. D. Beaton once wrote that no\r\nman could cross any species of Primula. You have apparently proved the\r\ncontrary with a vengeance. Your numerous experiments seem very well\r\nselected, and you will exhaust the subject. Now when you have completed\r\nyour work you should draw up a paper, well worth publishing, and give\r\na list of all the dimorphic and non-dimorphic forms. I can give you,\r\non the authority of Prof. Treviranus in \"Bot. Zeitung,\" case of P.\r\nlongiflora non-dimorphic. I am surprised at your cowslips in this state.\r\nIs it a common yellow cowslip? I have seen oxlips (which from some\r\nexperiments I now look at as certainly natural hybrids) in same state.\r\nIf you think the Botanical Society of Edinburgh would not do justice\r\nand publish your paper, send it to me to be communicated to the Linnean\r\nSociety. I will delay my paper on successive dimorphic generations in\r\nPrimula (644/3. Published in the \"Journ. Linn. Soc.\" X., 1869 [1868].)\r\ntill yours appears, so as in no way to interfere with your paper.\r\nPossibly my results may be hardly worth publishing, but I think they\r\nwill; the seedlings from two successive homomorphic generations seem\r\nexcessively sterile. I will keep this letter till I hear from Dr.\r\nHooker. I shall be very glad if you try Passiflora. Your experiments on\r\nPrimula seem so well chosen that whatever the result is they will be of\r\nvalue. But always remember that not one naturalist out of a dozen cares\r\nfor really philosophical experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 645. TO J. SCOTT. Down, May 31st [1863].\r\n\r\nI am unwell, and must write briefly. I am very much obliged for the\r\n\"Courant.\" (645/1. The Edinburgh \"Evening Courant\" used to publish\r\nnotices of the papers read at the Botanical Society of Edinburgh. The\r\npaper referred to here was Scott's on Oncidium.) The facts will be of\r\nhighest use to me. I feel convinced that your paper will have permanent\r\nvalue. Your case seems excellently and carefully worked out. I agree\r\nthat the alteration of title was unfortunate, but, after all, title does\r\nnot signify very much. So few have attended to such points that I do\r\nnot expect any criticism; but if so, I should think you had much better\r\nreply, but I could if you wished it much. I quite understand about the\r\ncases being individual sterility; so Gartner states it was with him.\r\nWould it be worth while to send a corrected copy of the \"Courant\" to the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle?\" (645/2. An account of Scott's work appeared in\r\nthe \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" June 13th, 1863, which is, at least partly,\r\na reprint of the \"Courant,\" since it contains the awkward sentence\r\ncriticised by Darwin and referred to below. The title is \"On the\r\nFertilisation of Orchids,\" which was no doubt considered unfortunate as\r\nnot suggesting the subject of the paper, and as being the same as that\r\nof Darwin's book.) I did not know that you had tried Lobelia fulgens:\r\ncan you give me any particulars on the number of plants and kinds used,\r\netc., that I may quote, as in a few days I shall be writing on this\r\nwhole subject? No one will ever convince me that it is not a very\r\nimportant subject to philosophical naturalists. The Hibiscus seems a\r\nvery curious case, and I agree with your remarks. You say that you are\r\nglad of criticisms (by the way avoid \"former and latter,\" the reader is\r\nalways forced to go back to look). I think you would have made the\r\ncase more striking if you had first showed that the pollen of\r\nOncidium sphacelatum was good; secondly, that the ovule was capable of\r\nfertilisation; and lastly, shown that the plant was impotent with its\r\nown pollen. \"Impotence of organs capable of elimination\"--capable here\r\nstrictly refers to organs; you mean to impotence. To eliminate impotence\r\nis a curious expression; it is removing a non-existent quality. But\r\nstyle is a trifle compared with facts, and you are capable of writing\r\nwell. I find it a good rule to imagine that I want to explain the case\r\nin as few and simple words as possible to one who knows nothing of the\r\nsubject. (645/3. See Letter 151, Volume I.) I am tired. In my opinion\r\nyou are an excellent observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 646. TO J. SCOTT. Down, June 6th, 1863.\r\n\r\nI fear that you think that I have done more than I have with respect to\r\nDr. Hooker. I did not feel that I had any right to ask him to remember\r\nyou for a colonial appointment: all that I have done is to speak most\r\nhighly of your scientific merits. Of course this may hereafter fructify.\r\nI really think you cannot go on better, for educational purposes, than\r\nyou are now doing,--observing, thinking, and some reading beat, in my\r\nopinion, all systematic education. Do not despair about your style; your\r\nletters are excellently written, your scientific style is a little\r\ntoo ambitious. I never study style; all that I do is to try to get\r\nthe subject as clear as I can in my own head, and express it in the\r\ncommonest language which occurs to me. But I generally have to think a\r\ngood deal before the simplest arrangement and words occur to me. Even\r\nwith most of our best English writers, writing is slow work; it is a\r\ngreat evil, but there is no help for it. I am sure you have no cause to\r\ndespair. I hope and suppose your sending a paper to the Linnean Society\r\nwill not offend your Edinburgh friends; you might truly say that you\r\nsent the paper to me, and that (if it turns out so) I thought it worth\r\ncommunicating to the Linnean Society. I shall feel great interest in\r\nstudying all your facts on Primula, when they are worked out and the\r\nseed counted. Size of capsules is often very deceptive. I am astonished\r\nhow you can find time to make so many experiments. If you like to send\r\nme your paper tolerably well written, I would look it over and suggest\r\nany criticisms; but then this would cause you extra copying. Remember,\r\nhowever, that Lord Brougham habitually wrote everything important three\r\ntimes over. The cases of the Primulae which lose by variation their\r\ndimorphic characters seem to me very interesting. I find that the\r\nmid-styled (by variation) P. sinensis is more fertile with own pollen,\r\neven, than a heteromorphic union! If you have time it will be very good\r\nto experiment on Linum Lewisii. I wrote formerly to Asa Gray begging for\r\nseed. If you have time, I think experiments on any peloric flowers would\r\nbe useful. I shall be sorry (and I am certain it is a mistake on the\r\npart of the Society) if your orchid paper is not printed in extenso.\r\nI am now at work compiling all such cases, and shall give a very full\r\nabstract of all your observations. I hope to add in autumn some from\r\nyou on Passiflora. I would suggest to you the advantage, at present,\r\nof being very sparing in introducing theory in your papers (I formerly\r\nerred much in Geology in that way): LET THEORY GUIDE YOUR OBSERVATIONS,\r\nbut till your reputation is well established be sparing in publishing\r\ntheory. It makes persons doubt your observations. How rarely R. Brown\r\never indulged in theory: too seldom perhaps! Do not work too hard,\r\nand do not be discouraged because your work is not appreciated by the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 647. TO J. SCOTT. July 2nd [1863?]\r\n\r\nMany thanks for capsules. I would give table of the Auricula (647/1.\r\nIn Scott's paper (\"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" VIII.) many experiments on the\r\nAuricula are recorded.), especially owing to enclosed extract, which you\r\ncan quote. Your facts about varying fertility of the primulas will be\r\nappreciated by but very few botanists; but I feel sure that the day will\r\ncome when they will be valued. By no means modify even in the slightest\r\ndegree any result. Accuracy is the soul of Natural History. It is hard\r\nto become accurate; he who modifies a hair's breadth will never be\r\naccurate. It is a golden rule, which I try to follow, to put every fact\r\nwhich is opposed to one's preconceived opinion in the strongest light.\r\nAbsolute accuracy is the hardest merit to attain, and the highest merit.\r\nAny deviation is ruin. Sincere thanks for all your laborious trials on\r\nPassiflora. I am very busy, and have got two of my sons ill--I very much\r\nfear with scarlet fever; if so, no more work for me for some days or\r\nweeks. I feel greatly interested about your Primula cases. I think it\r\nmuch better to count seed than to weigh. I wish I had never weighed;\r\ncounting is more accurate, though so troublesome.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 648. TO J. SCOTT. Down, 25th [1863?]\r\n\r\nFrom what you say I looked again at \"Bot. Zeitung.\" (648/1. \"Ueber\r\nDichogamie,\" \"Bot. Zeit.\" January 1863.) Treviranus speaks of P.\r\nlongiflora as short-styled, but this is evidently a slip of the pen, for\r\nfurther on, I see, he says the stigma always projects beyond anthers.\r\nYour experiments on coloured primroses will be most valuable if proved\r\ntrue. (648/2. The reference seems to be to Scott's observation that the\r\nvariety rubra of the primrose was sterile when crossed with pollen\r\nfrom the common primrose. Darwin's caution to Scott was in some\r\nmeasure justified, for in his experiments on seedlings raised by\r\nself-fertilisation of the Edinburgh plants, he failed to confirm Scott's\r\nresult. See \"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page 225. Scott's facts are\r\nin the \"Journal Linn. Soc.\" VIII., page 97 (read February 4th, 1864).) I\r\nwill advise to best of my power when I see MS. If evidence is not good\r\nI would recommend you, for your reputation's sake, to try them again. It\r\nis not likely that you will be anticipated, and it is a great thing\r\nto fully establish what in future time will be considered an important\r\ndiscovery (or rediscovery, for no one has noticed Gartner's facts). I\r\nwill procure coloured primroses for next spring, but you may rely I will\r\nnot publish before you. Do not work too hard to injure your health. I\r\nmade some crosses between primrose and cowslip, and I send the results,\r\nwhich you may use if you like. But remember that I am not quite\r\ncertain that I well castrated the short-styled primrose; I believe any\r\ncastration would be superfluous, as I find all [these] plants sterile\r\nwhen insects are excluded. Be sure and save seed of the crossed\r\ndifferently coloured primroses or cowslips which produced least seed,\r\nto test the fertility of the quasi-hybrid seedlings. Gartner found the\r\ncommon primrose and cowslip very difficult to cross, but he knew nothing\r\non dimorphism. I am sorry about delay [of] your orchid paper; I should\r\nbe glad of abstract of your new observations of self-sterility in\r\norchids, as I should probably use the new facts. There will be an\r\nimportant paper in September in \"Annals and Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory,\" on ovules of orchids being formed after application of pollen,\r\nby Dr. F. Hildebrand of Bonn. (648/3. \"Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.\" XII., 1863,\r\npage 169. The paper was afterwards published in the \"Bot. Zeitung,\"\r\n1863.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 649. TO J. SCOTT. Down, November 7th [1863].\r\n\r\nEvery day that I could do anything, I have read a few pages of your\r\npaper, and have now finished it, and return it registered. (649/1.\r\nThis refers to the MS. of Scott's paper on the Primulaceae, \"Linn. Soc.\r\nJourn.\" VIII. [February 4th, 1864] 1865.) It has interested me deeply,\r\nand is, I am sure, an excellent memoir. It is well arranged, and in most\r\nparts well written. In the proof sheets you can correct a little\r\nwith advantage. I have suggested a few alterations in pencil for your\r\nconsideration, and have put in here and there a slip of paper. There\r\nwill be no occasion to rewrite the paper--only, if you agree with me, to\r\nalter a few pages. When finished, return it to me, and I will with the\r\nhighest satisfaction communicate it to the Linnean Society. I should be\r\nproud to be the author of the paper. I shall not have caused much delay,\r\nas the first meeting of the Society was on November 5th. When your\r\nPrimula paper is finished, if you are so inclined, I should like to\r\nhear briefly about your Verbascum and Passiflora experiments. I tried\r\nVerbascum, and have got the pods, but do not know when I shall be able\r\nto see to the results. This subject might make another paper for you. I\r\nmay add that Acropera luteola was fertilised by me, and had produced two\r\nfine pods. I congratulate you on your excellent paper.\r\n\r\nP.S.--In the summary to Primula paper can you conjecture what is the\r\ntypical or parental form, i.e. equal, long or short styled?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 650. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [January 24th, 1864].\r\n\r\n(650/1. Darwin's interest in Scott's Primula work is shown by the\r\nfollowing extracts from a letter to Hooker of January 24th, 1864,\r\nwritten, therefore, before the paper was read, and also by the\r\nsubsequent correspondence with Hooker and Asa Gray. The first part of\r\nthis letter illustrates Darwin's condition during a period of especially\r\nbad health.)\r\n\r\nAs I do nothing all day I often get fidgety, and I now fancy that\r\nCharlie or some of your family [are] ill. When you have time let me have\r\na short note to say how you all are. I have had some fearful sickness;\r\nbut what a strange mechanism one's body is; yesterday, suddenly, I had\r\na slight attack of rheumatism in my back, and I instantly became almost\r\nwell, and so wonderfully strong that I walked to the hot-houses, which\r\nmust be more than a hundred yards. I have sent Scott's paper to the\r\nLinnean Society; I feel sure it is really valuable, but I fear few\r\nwill care about it. Remember my URGENT wish to be able to send the poor\r\nfellow a word of praise from any one. I have had work to get him to\r\nallow me to send the paper to the Linnean Society, even after it was\r\nwritten out.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 651. TO J. SCOTT. Down, February 9th, 1864.\r\n\r\n(651/1. Scott's paper on Primulaceae was read at the Linnean Society on\r\nFebruary 4th, 1864.)\r\n\r\nThe President, Mr. Bentham, I presume, was so much struck by your paper\r\nthat he sent me a message to know whether you would like to be elected\r\nan associate. As only one is elected annually, this is a decided honour.\r\nThe enclosed list shows what respectable men are associates. I\r\nenclose the rules of admission. I feel sure that the rule that if no\r\ncommunication is received within three years the associate is considered\r\nto have voluntarily withdrawn, is by no means rigorously adhered to.\r\nTherefore, I advise you to accept; but of course the choice is quite\r\nfree. You will see there is no payment. You had better write to me on\r\nthis subject, as Dr. Hooker or I will propose you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 652. TO J.D. HOOKER. September 13th, 1864.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly interested by Scott's paper. I probably overrate\r\nit from caring for the subject, but it certainly seems to me one of the\r\nvery most remarkable memoirs on such subjects which I have ever read.\r\nFrom the subject being complex, and the style in parts obscure, I\r\nsuppose very few will read it. I think it ought to be noticed in the\r\n\"Natural History Review,\" otherwise the more remarkable facts will never\r\nbe known. Try and persuade Oliver to do it; with the summary it would\r\nnot be troublesome. I would offer, but I have sworn to myself I will do\r\nnothing till my volume on \"Variation under Domestication\" is complete.\r\nI know you will not have time to read Scott, and therefore I will just\r\npoint out the new and, as they seem to me, important points.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the red cowslip, losing its dimorphic structure and changing\r\nso extraordinarily in its great production of seed with its own pollen,\r\nespecially being nearly sterile when fertilised by, or fertilising,\r\nthe common cowslip. The analogous facts with red and white primrose.\r\nSecondly, the utter dissimilarity of action of the pollen of long- and\r\nshort-styled form of one species in crossing with a distinct species.\r\nAnd many other points. Will you suggest to Oliver to review this paper?\r\nif he does so, and if it would be of any service to him, I would (as\r\nI have attended so much to these subjects) just indicate, with pages,\r\nleading and new points. I could send him, if he wishes, a separate and\r\nspare copy marked with pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 653. TO ASA GRAY. September 13th [1864].\r\n\r\n(653/1. In September, 1864, Darwin wrote to Asa Gray describing Scott's\r\nwork on the Primulaceae as:--)\r\n\r\nA paper which has interested me greatly by a gardener, John Scott;\r\nit seems to me a most remarkable production, though written rather\r\nobscurely in parts, but worth the labour of studying. I have just\r\nbethought me that for the chance of your noticing it in the \"Journal,\"\r\nI will point out the new and very remarkable facts. I have paid the poor\r\nfellow's passage out to India, where I hope he will succeed, as he is a\r\nmost laborious and able man, with the manners almost of a gentleman.\r\n\r\n(653/2. The following is an abstract of the paper which was enclosed in\r\nthe letter to Asa Gray.)\r\n\r\nPages 106-8. Red cowslip by variation has become non-dimorphic, and with\r\nthis change of structure has become much more productive of seed than\r\neven the heteromorphic union of the common cowslip. Pages 91-2, similar\r\ncase with Auricula; on the other hand a non-dimorphic variety of P.\r\nfarinosa (page 115) is less fertile. These changes, or variations,\r\nin the generative system seem to me very remarkable. But far more\r\nremarkable is the fact that the red cowslip (pages 106-8) is very\r\nsterile when fertilising, or fertilised by the common cowslip. Here we\r\nhave a new \"physiological species.\" Analogous facts given (page 98) on\r\nthe crossing of red and white primroses with common primroses. It is\r\nvery curious that the two forms of the same species (pages 93, 94, 95,\r\nand 117) hybridise with extremely different degrees of facility with\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nHe shows (page 94) that sometimes a cross with a quite distinct species\r\nyields more seed than a homomorphic union with own pollen. He shows\r\n(page 111) that of the two homomorphic unions possible with each\r\ndimorphic species the short-styled (as I stated) is the most sterile,\r\nand that my explanation is probably true. There is a good summary to the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 654. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(654/1. The following letters to Hooker, April 1st, April 5th and May\r\n22nd, refer to Darwin's scheme of employing Scott as an assistant at\r\nDown, and to Scott's appointment to the Botanic Garden at Calcutta.)\r\n\r\nDown, April 1st, 1864.\r\n\r\nI shall not at present allude to your very interesting letter (which as\r\nyet has been read to me only twice!), for I am full of a project which I\r\nmuch want you to consider.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen Scott's note. He tells me he has no plans for\r\nthe future. Thinking over all his letters, I believe he is a truly\r\nremarkable man. He is willing to follow suggestions, but has much\r\noriginality in varying his experiments. I believe years may pass before\r\nanother man appears fitted to investigate certain difficult and tedious\r\npoints--viz. relative fertility of varieties of plants, including\r\npeloric and other monsters (already Scott has done excellent work\r\non this head); and, secondly, whether a plant's own pollen is less\r\neffective than that of another individual. Now, if Scott is moderate\r\nin his wishes, I would pay him for a year or two to work and publish on\r\nthese or other such subjects which might arise. But I dare not have\r\nhim here, for it would quite overwork me. There would not be plants\r\nsufficient for his work, and it would probably be an injury to himself,\r\nas it would put him out of the way of getting a good situation. Now, I\r\nbelieve you have gardeners at Kew who work and learn there without pay.\r\nWhat do you think of having Scott there for a year or two to work and\r\nexperiment? I can see enormous difficulties. In the first place you\r\nwill not perhaps think the points indicated so highly important as I do.\r\nSecondly, he would require ground in some out-of-the-way place where the\r\nplants could be covered by a net, which would be unsightly. On the other\r\nhand, I presume you would like a series of memoirs published on work\r\ndone at Kew, which I am fully convinced would have permanent value. It\r\nwould, of course I conceive, be absolutely necessary that Scott should\r\nbe under the regular orders of the superintendent. The only way I can\r\nfancy that it could be done would be to explain to the superintendent\r\nthat I temporarily supported Scott solely for the sake of science, and\r\nappeal to his kindness to assist him. If you approved of having\r\nhim (which I can see is improbable), and you simply ordered the\r\nsuperintendent to assist him, I believe everything would go to\r\nloggerheads. As for Scott himself, it would be of course an advantage to\r\nhim to study the cultivation at Kew. You would get to know him, and if\r\nhe really is a good man you could perhaps be able to recommend him to\r\nsome situation at home or abroad. Pray turn this [over] in your mind. I\r\nhave no idea whether Scott would like the place, but I can see that\r\nhe has a burning zeal for science. He told me that his parents were in\r\nbetter circumstances, and that he chose a gardener's life solely as the\r\nbest way of following science. I may just add that in his last letter he\r\ngives me the results of many experiments on different individuals of the\r\nsame species of orchid, showing the most remarkable diversity in their\r\nsexual condition. It seems to me a grievous loss that such a man should\r\nhave all his work cut short. Please remember that I know nothing of him\r\nexcepting from his letters: these show remarkable talent, astonishing\r\nperseverance, much modesty, and what I admire, determined difference\r\nfrom me on many points.\r\n\r\nWhat will Sir William say?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 655. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 5th [1864].\r\n\r\nI see my scheme for Scott has invincible difficulties, and I am very\r\nmuch obliged to you for explaining them at such length. If ever I get\r\ndecently well, and Scott is free and willing, I will have him here for\r\na couple of years to work out several problems, which otherwise would\r\nnever be done. I cannot see what will become of the poor fellow. I\r\nenclose a little pamphlet from him, which I suppose is not of much\r\nscientific value, but is surprising as the work of a gardener. If\r\nyou have time do just glance over it. I never heard anything so\r\nextraordinary as what you say about poisoning plants, etc.\r\n\r\n...The post has just come in. Your interest about Scott is\r\nextraordinarily kind, and I thank you cordially. It seems absurd to\r\nsay so, but I suspect that X is prejudiced against Scott because he\r\npartially supports my views. (655/1. In a letter to Scott (dated June\r\n11th) Darwin warns him to keep his views \"pretty quiet,\" and quotes\r\nHooker's opinion that \"if it is known that you agree at all with my\r\nviews on species it is enough to make you unpopular in Edinburgh.\")\r\n\r\nYou must not trust my former letter about Clematis. I worked on too\r\nold a plant, and blundered. I have now gone over the work again. It\r\nis really curious that the stiff peduncles are acted upon by a bit of\r\nthread weighing .062 of a grain.\r\n\r\nClematis glandulosa was a valuable present to me. My gardener showed\r\nit to me and said, \"This is what they call a Clematis,\" evidently\r\ndisbelieving it. So I put a little twig to the peduncle, and the next\r\nday my gardener said, \"You see it is a Clematis, for it feels.\" That's\r\nthe way we make out plants at Down.\r\n\r\nMy dear old friend, God bless you!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 656. TO J.D. HOOKER. [May 22nd, 1864].\r\n\r\nWhat a good kind heart you have got. You cannot tell how your letter has\r\npleased me. I will write to Scott and ask him if he chooses to go out\r\nand risk engagement. If he will not he must want all energy. He says\r\nhimself he wants stoicism, and is too sensitive. I hope he may not want\r\ncourage. I feel sure he is a remarkable man, with much good in him, but\r\nno doubt many errors and blemishes. I can vouch for his high intellect\r\n(in my judgment he is the best observer I ever came across); for his\r\nmodesty, at least in correspondence; and there is something high-minded\r\nin his determination not to receive money from me. I shall ask him\r\nwhether he can get a good character for probity and sobriety, and\r\nwhether he can get aid from his relations for his voyage out. I will\r\nhelp, and, if necessary, pay the whole voyage, and give him enough to\r\nsupport him for some weeks at Calcutta. I will write when I hear from\r\nhim. God bless you; you, who are so overworked, are most generous to\r\ntake so much trouble about a man you have had nothing to do with.\r\n\r\n(656/1. Scott had left the Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh in March 1864,\r\nchagrined at what, justly or unjustly, he considered discouragement and\r\nslight. The Indian offer was most gladly and gratefully accepted.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 657. TO J. SCOTT. Down, November 1st, 1871.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker has forwarded to me your letter as the best and simplest plan\r\nof explaining affairs. I am sincerely grieved to hear of the pecuniary\r\nproblem which you have undergone, but now fortunately passed. I assure\r\nyou that I have never entertained any feelings in regard to you which\r\nyou suppose. Please to remember that I distinctly stated that I did not\r\nconsider the sum which I advanced as a loan, but as a gift; and surely\r\nthere is nothing discreditable to you, under the circumstances, in\r\nreceiving a gift from a rich man, as I am. Therefore I earnestly beg\r\nyou to banish the whole subject from your mind, and begin laying up\r\nsomething for yourself in the future. I really cannot break my word and\r\naccept payment. Pray do not rob me of my small share in the credit of\r\naiding to put the right man in the right place. You have done good work,\r\nand I am sure will do more; so let us never mention the subject again.\r\n\r\nI am, after many interruptions, at work again on my essay on Expression,\r\nwhich was written out once many months ago. I have found your remarks\r\nthe best of all which have been sent me, and so I state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.XI.--BOTANY, 1863-1881.\r\n\r\n2.XI.I. Miscellaneous, 1863-1866.--2.XI.II. Correspondence with Fritz\r\nMuller, 1865-1881.--2.XI.III. Miscellaneous, 1868-1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.XI.I. MISCELLANEOUS, 1863-1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 658. TO D. OLIVER. Down [April, 1863].\r\n\r\n(658/1. The following letter illustrates the truth of Sir W.\r\nThiselton-Dyer's remark that Darwin was never \"afraid of his facts.\"\r\n(658/2. \"Charles Darwin\" (Nature Series), 1882, page 43.) The entrance\r\nof pollen-tubes into the nucellus by the chalaza, instead of through the\r\nmicropyle, was first fully demonstrated by Treub in his paper \"Sur les\r\nCasuarinees et leur place dans le Systeme naturel,\" published in the\r\n\"Ann. Jard. Bot. Buitenzorg,\" X., 1891. Two years later Miss Benson gave\r\nan account of a similar phenomenon in certain Amentiferae (\"Trans. Linn.\r\nSoc.\" 1888-94, page 409). This chalazogamic method of fertilisation has\r\nsince been recognised in other flowering plants, but not, so far as we\r\nare aware, in the genus Primula.)\r\n\r\nIt is a shame to trouble [you], but will you tell me whether the ovule\r\nof Primula is \"anatropal,\" nearly as figured by Gray, page 123, \"Lessons\r\nin Botany,\" or rather more tending to \"amphitropal\"? I never looked at\r\nsuch a point before. Why I am curious to know is because I put pollen\r\ninto the ovarium of monstrous primroses, and now, after sixteen days,\r\nand not before (the length of time agrees with slowness of natural\r\nimpregnation), I find abundance of pollen-tubes emitted, which cling\r\nfirmly to the ovules, and, I think I may confidently state, penetrate\r\nthe ovule. But here is an odd thing: they never once enter at (what I\r\nsuppose to be) the \"orifice,\" but generally at the chalaza...Do you\r\nknow how pollen-tubes go naturally in Primula? Do they run down walls\r\nof ovarium, and then turn up the placenta, and so debouch near the\r\n\"orifices\" of the ovules?\r\n\r\nIf you thought it worth while to examine ovules, I would see if there\r\nare more monstrous flowers, and put pollen into the ovarium, and send\r\nyou the flowers in fourteen or fifteen days afterwards. But it is rather\r\ntroublesome. I would not do it unless you cared to examine the ovules.\r\nLike a foolish and idle man, I have wasted a whole morning over them...\r\n\r\nIn two ovules there was an odd appearance, as if the outer coat of ovule\r\nat the chalaza end (if I understand the ovule) had naturally opened or\r\nwithered where most of the pollen-tubes seemed to penetrate, which made\r\nme at first think this was a widely open foramen. I wonder whether the\r\novules could be thus fertilised?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 659. TO D. OLIVER. Down [April, 1863].\r\n\r\nMany thanks about the Primula. I see that I was pretty right about the\r\novules. I have been thinking that the apparent opening at the chalaza\r\nend must have been withering or perhaps gnawing by some very minute\r\ninsects, as the ovarium is open at the upper end. If I have time I will\r\nhave another look at pollen-tubes, as, from what you say, they ought\r\nto find their way to the micropyle. But ovules to me are far more\r\ntroublesome to dissect than animal tissue; they are so soft, and muddy\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 660. TO MAXWELL MASTERS. Down, April 6th [1863].\r\n\r\nI have been very glad to read your paper on Peloria. (660/1. \"On the\r\nExistence of Two Forms of Peloria.\" \"Natural History Review,\" April,\r\n1863, page 258.) For the mere chance of the following case being new\r\nI send it. A plant which I purchased as Corydalis tuberosa has, as you\r\nknow, one nectary--short, white, and without nectar; the pistil is bowed\r\ntowards the true nectary; and the hood formed by the inner petals slips\r\noff towards the opposite side (all adaptations to insect agency, like\r\nmany other pretty ones in this family). Now on my plants there are\r\nseveral flowers (the fertility of which I will observe) with both\r\nnectaries equal and purple and secreting nectar; the pistil is straight,\r\nand the hood slips off either way. In short, these flowers have the\r\nexact structure of Dielytra and Adlumia. Seeing this, I must look at\r\nthe case as one of reversion; though it is one of the spreading of\r\nirregularity to two sides.\r\n\r\nAs columbine [Aquilegia] has all petals, etc., irregular, and as\r\nmonkshood [Aconitum] has two petals irregular, may not the case given by\r\nSeringe, and referred to [by] you (660/2. \"Seringe describes and figures\r\na flower [of Aconitum] wherein all the sepals were helmet-shaped,\" and\r\nthe petals similarly affected. Maxwell Masters, op. cit., page 260.),\r\nby you be looked at as reversion to the columbine state? Would it be\r\ntoo bold to suppose that some ancient Linaria, or allied form, and\r\nsome ancient Viola, had all petals spur-shaped, and that all cases of\r\n\"irregular peloria\" in these genera are reversions to such imaginary\r\nancient form? (660/3. \"'Regular or Congenital Peloria' would include\r\nthose flowers which, contrary to their usual habit, retain throughout\r\nthe whole of their growth their primordial regularity of form and\r\nequality of proportion. 'Irregular or Acquired Peloria,' on the other\r\nhand, would include those flowers in which the irregularity of growth\r\nthat ordinarily characterises some portions of the corolla is manifested\r\nin all of them.\" Maxwell Masters, loc. cit.)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, in my ignorance, that it would be advantageous to\r\nconsider the two forms of Peloria WHEN OCCURRING IN THE VERY SAME\r\nSPECIES as probably due to the same general law--viz., one as reversion\r\nto very early state, and the other as reversion to a later state when\r\nall the petals were irregularly formed. This seems at least to me a\r\npriori a more probable view than to look at one form of Peloria as due\r\nto reversion and the other as something distinct. (660/4. See Maxwell\r\nMasters, \"Vegetable Teratology,\" 1869, page 235; \"Variation of Animals\r\nand Plants,\" Edition II., Volume II., page 33.)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this notion?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 661. TO P.H. GOSSE.\r\n\r\n(661/1. The following was written in reply to Mr. Gosse's letter of May\r\n30th asking for a solution of his difficulties in fertilising Stanhopea.\r\nIt is reprinted by the kind permission of Mr. Edmund Gosse from his\r\ndelightful book, the \"Life of Philip Henry Gosse,\" London, 1890, page\r\n299.)\r\n\r\nDown, June 2nd, 1863.\r\n\r\nIt would give me real pleasure to resolve your doubts, but I cannot.\r\nI can give only suspicions and my grounds for them. I should think the\r\nnon-viscidity of the stigmatic hollow was due to the plant not living\r\nunder its natural conditions. Please see what I have said on Acropera.\r\nAn excellent observer, Mr. J. Scott, of the Botanical Gardens,\r\nEdinburgh, finds all that I say accurate, but, nothing daunted, he with\r\nthe knife enlarged the orifice and forced in pollen-masses; or he simply\r\nstuck them into the contracted orifice without coming into contact\r\nwith the stigmatic surface, which is hardly at all viscid, when, lo and\r\nbehold, pollen-tubes were emitted and fine seed capsules obtained. This\r\nwas effected with Acropera Loddigesii; but I have no doubt that I have\r\nblundered badly about A. luteola. I mention all this because, as Mr.\r\nScott remarks, as the plant is in our hot-houses, it is quite incredible\r\nit ever could be fertilised in its native land. The whole case is an\r\nutter enigma to me. Probably you are aware that there are cases (and\r\nit is one of the oddest facts in Physiology) of plants which, under\r\nculture, have their sexual functions in so strange a condition, that\r\nthough their pollen and ovules are in a sound state and can fertilise\r\nand be fertilised by distinct but allied species, they cannot fertilise\r\nthemselves. Now, Mr. Scott has found this the case with certain orchids,\r\nwhich again shows sexual disturbance. He had read a paper at the\r\nBotanical Society of Edinburgh, and I daresay an abstract which I have\r\nseen will appear in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\"; but blunders have crept\r\nin in copying, and parts are barely intelligible. How insects act with\r\nyour Stanhopea I will not pretend to conjecture. In many cases I believe\r\nthe acutest man could not conjecture without seeing the insect at\r\nwork. I could name common English plants in this predicament. But the\r\nmusk-orchis [Herminium monorchis] is a case in point. Since publishing,\r\nmy son and myself have watched the plant and seen the pollinia\r\nremoved, and where do you think they invariably adhere in dozens of\r\nspecimens?--always to the joint of the femur with the trochanter of the\r\nfirst pair of legs, and nowhere else. When one sees such adaptation as\r\nthis, it would be hopeless to conjecture on the Stanhopea till we know\r\nwhat insect visits it. I have fully proved that my strong suspicion was\r\ncorrect that with many of our English orchids no nectar is excreted, but\r\nthat insects penetrate the tissues for it. So I expect it must be with\r\nmany foreign species. I forgot to say that if you find that you cannot\r\nfertilise any of your exotics, take pollen from some allied form, and it\r\nis quite probable that will succeed. Will you have the kindness to look\r\noccasionally at your bee-Ophrys near Torquay, and see whether pollinia\r\nare ever removed? It is my greatest puzzle. Please read what I have said\r\non it, and on O. arachnites. I have since proved that the account of the\r\nlatter is correct. I wish I could have given you better information.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If the Flowers of the Stanhopea are not too old, remove\r\npollen-masses from their pedicels, and stick them with a little liquid\r\npure gum to the stigmatic cavity. After the case of the Acropera, no one\r\ncan dare positively say that they would not act.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 662. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Saturday, 5th [December 1863].\r\n\r\nI am very glad that this will reach you at Kew. You will then get rest,\r\nand I do hope some lull in anxiety and fear. Nothing is so dreadful in\r\nthis life as fear; it still sickens me when I cannot help remembering\r\nsome of the many illnesses our children have endured. My father, who\r\nwas a sceptical man, was convinced that he had distinctly traced several\r\ncases of scarlet fever to handling letters from convalescents.\r\n\r\nThe vases (662/1. Probably Wedgwood ware.) did come from my sister\r\nSusan. She is recovering, and was much pleased to hear that you liked\r\nthem; I have now sent one of your notes to her, in which you speak of\r\nthem as \"enchanting,\" etc. I have had a bad spell--vomiting, every\r\nday for eleven days, and some days many times after every meal. It is\r\nastonishing the degree to which I keep up some strength. Dr. Brinton was\r\nhere two days ago, and says he sees no reason [why] I may not recover my\r\nformer degree of health. I should like to live to do a little more work,\r\nand often I feel sure I shall, and then again I feel that my tether is\r\nrun out.\r\n\r\nYour Hastings note, my dear old fellow, was a Copley Medal to me and\r\nmore than a Copley Medal: not but what I know well that you overrate\r\nwhat I have been able to do. (662/2. The proposal to give the medal\r\nto Darwin failed in 1863, but his friends were successful in 1864: see\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" III., page 28.) Now that I am disabled, I feel more\r\nthan ever what a pleasure observing and making out little difficulties\r\nis. By the way, here is a very little fact which may interest you. A\r\npartridge foot is described in \"Proc. Zoolog. Soc.\" with a huge ball of\r\nearth attached to it as hard as rock. (662/3. \"Proc. Zool. Soc.\" 1863,\r\npage 127, by Prof. Newton, who sent the foot to Darwin: see \"Origin,\"\r\nEdition VI., page 328.) Bird killed in 1860. Leg has been sent me, and I\r\nfind it diseased, and no doubt the exudation caused earth to accumulate;\r\nnow already thirty-two plants have come up from this ball of earth.\r\n\r\nBy Jove! I must write no more. Good-bye, my best of friends.\r\n\r\nThere is an Italian edition of the \"Origin\" preparing. This makes the\r\nfifth foreign edition--i.e. in five foreign countries. Owen will not be\r\nright in telling Longmans that the book would be utterly forgotten in\r\nten years. Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 663. TO D. OLIVER. Down, February 17th [1864].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the Epacrids, which I have kept, as they will interest\r\nme when able to look through the microscope.\r\n\r\nDr. Cruger has sent me the enclosed paper, with power to do what I think\r\nfit with it. He would evidently prefer it to appear in the \"Nat. Hist.\r\nReview.\" Please read it, and let me have your decision pretty soon. Some\r\ngermanisms must be corrected; whether woodcuts are necessary I have not\r\nbeen able to pay attention enough to decide. If you refuse, please send\r\nit to the Linnean Society as communicated by me. (663/1. H. Cruger's\r\n\"A Few Notes on the Fecundation of Orchids, etc.\" [Read March, 1864.]\r\n\"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" VIII., 1864-5, page 127.) The paper has interested\r\nme extremely, and I shall have no peace till I have a good boast. The\r\nsexes are separate in Catasetum, which is a wonderful relief to me, as I\r\nhave had two or three letters saying that the male C. tridentatum seeds.\r\n(663/2. See footnote Letter 608 on the sexual relation between the three\r\nforms known as Catasetum tridentatum, Monacanthus viridis, and Myanthus\r\nbarbatus. For further details see Darwin, \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" VI., 1862,\r\npage 151, and \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page 196.) It\r\nis pretty clear to me that two or three forms are confounded under this\r\nname. Observe how curiously nearly perfect the pollen of the female is,\r\naccording to Cruger,--certainly more perfect than the pollen from the\r\nGuyana species described by me. I was right in the manner in which the\r\npollen adheres to the hairy back of the humble-bee, and hence the\r\nforce of the ejection of the pollina. (663/3. This view was given in\r\n\"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition I., 1862, page 230.) I am still more\r\npleased that I was right about insects gnawing the fleshy labellum.\r\nThis is important, as it explains all the astounding projections on the\r\nlabellum of Oncidium, Phalaenopsis, etc.\r\n\r\nExcuse all my boasting. It is the best medicine for my stomach. Tell me\r\nwhether you mean to take up orchids, as Hooker said you were thinking of\r\ndoing. Do you know Coryanthes, with its wonderful basket of water? See\r\nwhat Cruger says about it. It beats everything in orchids. (663/4. For\r\nCoryanthes see \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page 173.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 664. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [September 13th, 1864].\r\n\r\nThanks for your note of the 5th. You think much and greatly too much\r\nof me and my doings; but this is pleasant, for you have represented for\r\nmany years the whole great public to me.\r\n\r\nI have read with interest Bentham's address on hybridism. I am glad\r\nthat he is cautious about Naudin's view, for I cannot think that it will\r\nhold. (664/1. C. Naudin's \"Nouvelles Recherches sur l'Hydridite dans les\r\nVegetaux.\" The complete paper, with coloured plates, was presented to\r\nthe Academy in 1861, and published in full in the \"Nouvelles Archives\r\nde Museum d'Hist. Nat.\" Volume I., 1865, page 25. The second part only\r\nappeared in the \"Ann. Sci. Nat.\" XIX., 1863. Mr. Bentham's address\r\ndealing with hybridism is in \"Proc. Linn. Soc.\" VIII., 1864, page ix.\r\nA review of Naudin is given in the \"Natural History Review,\" 1864,\r\npage 50. Naudin's paper is of much interest, as containing a mechanical\r\ntheory of reproduction of the same general character as that of\r\npangenesis. In the \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" Edition II.,\r\nVolume II., page 395, Darwin states that in his treatment of hybridism\r\nin terms of gemmules he is practically following Naudin's treatment of\r\nthe same theme in terms of \"essences.\" Naudin, however, does not clearly\r\ndistinguish between hybrid and pure gemmules, and makes the assumption\r\nthat the hybrid or mixed essences tend constantly to dissociate into\r\npure parental essences, and thus lead to reversion. It is to this view\r\nthat Darwin refers when he says that Naudin's view throws no light on\r\nthe reversion to long-lost characters. His own attempt at explaining\r\nthis fact occurs in \"Variation under Domestication,\" II., Edition II.,\r\npage 395. Mr. Bateson (\"Mendel's Principle of Heredity,\" Cambridge,\r\n1902, page 38) says: \"Naudin clearly enuntiated what we shall henceforth\r\nknow as the Mendelian conception of the dissociation of characters of\r\ncross-breds in the formation of the germ-cells, though apparently he\r\nnever developed this conception.\" It is remarkable that, as far as we\r\nknow, Darwin never in any way came across Mendel's work. One of Darwin's\r\ncorrespondents, however, the late Mr. T. Laxton, of Stamford, was close\r\non the trail of Mendelian principle. Mr. Bateson writes (op. cit., page\r\n181): \"Had he [Laxton] with his other gifts combined this penetration\r\nwhich detects a great principle hidden in the thin mist of 'exceptions,'\r\nwe should have been able to claim for him that honour which must ever\r\nbe Mendel's in the history of discovery.\") The tendency of hybrids\r\nto revert to either parent is part of a wider law (which I am fully\r\nconvinced that I can show experimentally), namely, that crossing races\r\nas well as species tends to bring back characters which existed in\r\nprogenitors hundreds and thousands of generations ago. Why this should\r\nbe so, God knows. But Naudin's view throws no light, that I can see,\r\non this reversion of long-lost characters. I wish the Ray Society would\r\ntranslate Gartner's \"Bastarderzeugung\"; it contains more valuable matter\r\nthan all other writers put together, and would do great service\r\nif better known. (664/2. \"Versuche uber die Bastarderzeugung im\r\nPflanzenreich\": Stuttgart, 1849.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 665. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(665/1. Mr. Huxley had doubted the accuracy of observations on Catasetum\r\npublished in the \"Fertilisation of Orchids.\" In what formed the\r\npostscript to the following letter, Darwin wrote: \"I have had more\r\nCatasetums,--all right, you audacious 'caviller.'\")\r\n\r\nDown, October 31st [1862].\r\n\r\nIn a little book, just published, called the \"Three Barriers\" (a\r\ntheological hash of old abuse of me), Owen gives to the author a new\r\nresume of his brain doctrine; and I thought you would like to hear of\r\nthis. He ends with a delightful sentence. \"No science affords more scope\r\nor easier ground for the caviller and controversialist; and these do\r\ngood by preventing scholars from giving more force to generalisations\r\nthan the master propounding them does, or meant his readers or hearers\r\nto give.\"\r\n\r\nYou will blush with pleasure to hear that you are of some use to the\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 666. TO J.D. HOOKER. [February, 1864?]\r\n\r\nI shall write again. I write now merely to ask, if you have Naravelia\r\n(666/1. Ranunculaceae.) (the Clematis-like plant told me by Oliver),\r\nto try and propagate me a plant at once. Have you Clematis cirrhosa? It\r\nwill amuse me to tell you why Clematis interests me, and why I should\r\nso very much like to have Naravelia. The leaves of Clematis have no\r\nspontaneous movement, nor have the internodes; but when by growth the\r\npeduncles of leaves are brought into contact with any object, they bend\r\nand catch hold. The slightest stimulus suffices, even a bit of cotton\r\nthread a few inches long; but the stimulus must be applied during six\r\nor twelve hours, and when the peduncles once bend, though the touching\r\nobject be removed, they never get straight again. Now mark the\r\ndifference in another leaf-climber--viz., Tropaeolum: here the young\r\ninternodes revolve day and night, and the peduncles of the leaves are\r\nthus brought into contact with an object, and the slightest momentary\r\ntouch causes them to bend in any direction and catch the object, but as\r\nthe axis revolves they must be often dragged away without catching, and\r\nthen the peduncles straighten themselves again, and are again ready to\r\ncatch. So that the nervous system of Clematis feels only a prolonged\r\ntouch--that of Tropaeolum a momentary touch: the peduncles of the latter\r\nrecover their original position, but Clematis, as it comes into contact\r\nby growth with fixed objects, has no occasion to recover its position,\r\nand cannot do so. You did send me Flagellaria, but most unfortunately\r\nyoung plants do not have tendrils, and I fear my plant will not get them\r\nfor another year, and this I much regret, as these leaf-tendrils seem\r\nvery curious, and in Gloriosa I could not make out the action, but\r\nI have now a young plant of Gloriosa growing up (as yet with simple\r\nleaves) which I hope to make out. Thank Oliver for decisive answer about\r\ntendrils of vines. It is very strange that tendrils formed of modified\r\nleaves and branches should agree in all their four highly remarkable\r\nproperties. I can show a beautiful gradation by which LEAVES produce\r\ntendrils, but how the axis passes into a tendril utterly puzzles me. I\r\nwould give a guinea if vine-tednrils could be found to be leaves.\r\n\r\n(666/2. It is an interesting fact that Darwin's work on climbing plants\r\nwas well advanced before he discovered the existence of the works of\r\nPalm, Mohl, and Dutrochet on this subject. On March 22nd, 1864, he\r\nwrote to Hooker:--\"You quite overrate my tendril work, and there is no\r\noccasion to plague myself about priority.\" In June he speaks of having\r\nread \"two German books, and all, I believe, that has been written on\r\nclimbers, and it has stirred me up to find that I have a good deal of\r\nnew matter.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 667. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 2nd [1864].\r\n\r\nYou once offered me a Combretum. (667/1. The two forms of shoot in C.\r\nargenteum are described in \"Climbing Plants,\" page 41.) I having C.\r\npurpureum, out of modesty like an ass refused. Can you now send me\r\na plant? I have a sudden access of furor about climbers. Do you grow\r\nAdlumia cirrhosa? Your seed did not germinate with me. Could you have\r\na seedling dug up and potted? I want it fearfully, for it is a\r\nleaf-climber, and therefore sacred.\r\n\r\nI have some hopes of getting Adlumia, for I used to grow the plant,\r\nand seedlings have often come up, and we are now potting all minute\r\nreddish-coloured weeds. (667/2. We believe that the Adlumia which came\r\nup year by year in flower boxes in the Down verandah grew from seed\r\nsupplied by Asa Gray.) I have just got a plant with sensitive axis,\r\nquite a new case; and tell Oliver I now do not care at all how many\r\ntendrils he makes axial, which at one time was a cruel torture to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 668. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 3rd [1864].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your splendid long letter. But first for business.\r\nPlease look carefully at the enclosed specimen of Dicentra\r\nthalictriformis, and throw away. (668/1. Dicentra thalictrifolia, a\r\nHimalayan species of Fumariaceae, with leaf-tendrils.) When the plant\r\nwas young I concluded certainly that the tendrils were axial, or\r\nmodified branches, which Mohl says is the case with some Fumariaceae.\r\n(668/2. \"Ueber den Bau und das Winden der Ranken und Schlingpflanzen.\r\nEine gekronte Preisschrift,\" 4to, Tubingen, 1827. At page 43 Mohl\r\ndescribes the tips of the branches of Fumaria [Corydalis] clavicualta\r\nas being developed into tendrils, as well as the leaves. For this reason\r\nDarwin placed the plant among the tendril-bearers rather than among the\r\ntrue leaf-climbers: see \"Climbing Plants,\" Edition II., 1875, page 121.)\r\nYou looked at them here and agreed. But now the plant is old, what I\r\nthought was a branch with two leaves and ending in a tendril looks\r\nlike a gigantic leaf with two compound leaflets, and the terminal part\r\nconverted into a tendril. For I see buds in the fork between supposed\r\nbranch and main stem. Pray look carefully--you know I am profoundly\r\nignorant--and save me from a horrid mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 669. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(669/1. The following is interesting, as containing a foreshadowing of\r\nthe chemotaxis of antherozoids which was shown to exist by Pfeffer in\r\n1881: see \"Untersuchungen aus dem botanischen Institut zu Tubingen,\"\r\nVolume I., page 363. There are several papers by H.J. Carter on the\r\nreproduction of the lower organisms in the \"Annals and Magazine of\r\nNatural History\" between 1855 and 1865.)\r\n\r\nDown, Sunday, 22nd, and Saturday, 28th [October, 1865].\r\n\r\nI have been wading through the \"Annals and Mag. of N. History.\" for last\r\nten years, and have been interested by several papers, chiefly, however,\r\ntranslations; but none have interested me more than Carter's on lower\r\nvegetables, infusoria, and protozoa. Is he as good a workman as he\r\nappears? for if so he would deserve a Royal medal. I know it is not new;\r\nbut how wonderful his account of the spermatozoa of some dioecious alga\r\nor conferva, swimming and finding the minute micropyle in a distinct\r\nplant, and forcing its way in! Why, these zoospores must possess some\r\nsort of organ of sense to guide their locomotive powers to the small\r\nmicropyle; and does not this necessarily imply something like a nervous\r\nsystem, in the same way as complemental male cirripedes have organs of\r\nsense and locomotion, and nothing else but a sack of spermatozoa?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 670. TO F. HILDEBRAND. May 16th, 1866.\r\n\r\nSince writing to you before, I have read your admirable memoir on\r\nSalvia (670/1. \"Pringsheim's Jahrbucher,\" Volume IV., 1866.), and it has\r\ninterested me almost as much as when I first investigated the structure\r\nof orchids. Your paper illustrates several points in my \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" especially the transition of organs. Knowing only two or three\r\nspecies in the genus, I had often marvelled how one cell of the anther\r\ncould have been transformed into the moveable plate or spoon; and how\r\nwell you show the gradations. But I am surprised that you did not more\r\nstrongly insist on this point.\r\n\r\nI shall be still more surprised if you do not ultimately come to the\r\nsame belief with me, as shown by so many beautiful contrivances,--that\r\nall plants require, from some unknown cause, to be occasionally\r\nfertilised by pollen from a distinct individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: FRITZ MULLER.)\r\n\r\n\r\n2.XI.II. CORRESPONDENCE WITH FRITZ MULLER, 1865-1881.\r\n\r\n(671/1. The letters from Darwin to Muller are given as a separate group,\r\ninstead of in chronological sequence with the other botanical letters,\r\nas better illustrating the uninterrupted friendship and scientific\r\ncomradeship of the two naturalists.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 671. TO F. MULLER. Down, October 17th [1865].\r\n\r\nI received about a fortnight ago your second letter on climbing plants,\r\ndated August 31st. It has greatly interested me, and it corrects and\r\nfills up a great hiatus in my paper. As I thought you could not object,\r\nI am having your letter copied, and will send the paper to the Linnean\r\nSociety. (671/2. \"Notes on some of the Climbing Plants near Desterro\"\r\n[1865], \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" IX., 1867.) I have slightly modified the\r\narrangement of some parts and altered only a few words, as you write as\r\ngood English as an Englishman. I do not quite understand your account of\r\nthe arrangement of the leaves of Strychnos, and I think you use the word\r\n\"bracteae\" differently to what English authors do; therefore I will get\r\nDr. Hooker to look over your paper.\r\n\r\nI cannot, of course, say whether the Linnean Society will publish your\r\npaper; but I am sure it ought to do so. As the Society is rather poor,\r\nI fear that it will give only a few woodcuts from your truly admirable\r\nsketches.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 672. TO F. MULLER.\r\n\r\n(672/1. In Darwin's book on Climbing Plants, 1875 (672/2. First given\r\nas a paper before the Linnean Society, and published in the \"Linn. Soc.\r\nJourn.\" Volume IX.,), he wrote (page 205): \"The conclusion is forced on\r\nour minds that the capacity of revolving, on which most climbing plants\r\ndepend, is inherent, though undeveloped, in almost every plant in the\r\nvegetable Kingdom\"--a conclusion which was verified in the \"Power of\r\nMovement in Plants.\" The present letter is interesting in referring\r\nto Fritz Muller's observations on the \"revolving nutation,\" or\r\ncircumnutation of Alisma macrophylla and Linum usitatissimum, the latter\r\nfact having been discovered by F. Muller's daughter Rosa. This\r\nwas probably the earliest observation on the circumnutation of a\r\nnon-climbing plant, and Muller, in a paper dated 1868, and published in\r\nVolume V. of the \"Jenaische Zeitschrift,\" page 133, calls attention to\r\nits importance in relation to the evolution of the habit of climbing.\r\nThe present letter was probably written in 1865, since it refers to\r\nMuller's paper read before the Linnean Soc. on December 7th, 1865. If\r\nso, the facts on circumnutation must have been communicated to Darwin\r\nsome years before their publication in the \"Jenaische Zeitschrift.\")\r\n\r\nDown, December 9th [1865].\r\n\r\nI have received your interesting letter of October 10th, with its new\r\nfacts on branch-tendrils. If the Linnean Society publishes your paper\r\n(672/3. Ibid., 1867, page 344.), as I am sure it ought to do, I will\r\nappend a note with some of these new facts.\r\n\r\nI forwarded immediately your MS. to Professor Max Schultze, but I did\r\nnot read it, for German handwriting utterly puzzles me, and I am so\r\nweak, I am capable of no exertion. I took the liberty, however, of\r\nasking him to send me a copy, if separate ones are printed, and I\r\nreminded him about the Sponge paper.\r\n\r\nYou will have received before this my book on orchids, and I wish I\r\nhad known that you would have preferred the English edition. Should the\r\nGerman edition fail to reach you, I will send an English one. That is a\r\ncurious observation of your daughter about the movement of the apex of\r\nthe stem of Linum, and would, I think, be worth following out. (672/4.\r\nF. Muller, \"Jenaische Zeitschrift,\" Bd. V., page 137. Here, also, are\r\ndescribed the movements of Alisma.) I suspect many plants move a little,\r\nfollowing the sun; but all do not, for I have watched some pretty\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\nI can give you no zoological news, for I live the life of the most\r\nsecluded hermit.\r\n\r\nI occasionally hear from Ernest Hackel, who seems as determined as you\r\nare to work out the subject of the change of species. You will have seen\r\nhis curious paper on certain medusae reproducing themselves by seminal\r\ngeneration at two periods of growth.\r\n\r\n(672/5. On April 3rd, 1868, Darwin wrote to F. Muller: \"Your diagram of\r\nthe movements of the flower-peduncle of the Alisma is extremely curious.\r\nI suppose the movement is of no service to the plant, but shows how\r\neasily the species might be converted into a climber. Does it bend\r\nthrough irritability when rubbed?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 673. TO F. MULLER. Down, September 25th [1866].\r\n\r\nI have just received your letter of August 2nd, and am, as usual,\r\nastonished at the number of interesting points which you observe. It\r\nis quite curious how, by coincidence, you have been observing the same\r\nsubjects that have lately interested me.\r\n\r\nYour case of the Notylia is quite new to me (673/1. See F. Muller, \"Bot.\r\nZeitung,\" 1868, page 630; \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page\r\n171.); but it seems analogous with that of Acropera, about the sexes\r\nof which I blundered greatly in my book. I have got an Acropera now in\r\nflower, and have no doubt that some insect, with a tuft of hairs on its\r\ntail, removes by the tuft, the pollinia, and inserts the little viscid\r\ncap and the long pedicel into the narrow stigmatic cavity, and leaves\r\nit there with the pollen-masses in close contact with, but not inserted\r\ninto, the stigmatic cavity. I find I can thus fertilise the flowers, and\r\nso I can with Stanhopea, and I suspect that this is the case with your\r\nNotylia. But I have lately had an orchis in flower--viz. Acineta,\r\nwhich I could not anyhow fertilise. Dr. Hildebrand lately wrote a paper\r\n(673/2. \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1863, 1865.) showing that with some orchids\r\nthe ovules are not mature and are not fertilised until months after\r\nthe pollen-tubes have penetrated the column, and you have independently\r\nobserved the same fact, which I never suspected in the case of Acropera.\r\nThe column of such orchids must act almost like the spermatheca of\r\ninsects. Your orchis with two leaf-like stigmas is new to me; but I\r\nfeel guilty at your wasting your valuable time in making such beautiful\r\ndrawings for my amusement.\r\n\r\nYour observations on those plants being sterile which grow separately,\r\nor flower earlier than others, are very interesting to me: they would be\r\nworth experimenting on with other individuals. I shall give in my next\r\nbook several cases of individual plants being sterile with their\r\nown pollen. I have actually got on my list Eschscholtzia (673/3. See\r\n\"Animals and Plants,\" II., Edition II., page 118.) for fertilising with\r\nits own pollen, though I did not suspect it would prove sterile, and\r\nI will try next summer. My object is to compare the rate of growth of\r\nplants raised from seed fertilised by pollen from the same flower and by\r\npollen from a distinct plant, and I think from what I have seen I shall\r\narrive at interesting results. Dr. Hildebrand has lately described\r\na curious case of Corydalis cava which is quite sterile with its own\r\npollen, but fertile with pollen of any other individual plant of the\r\nspecies. (673/4. \"International Horticultural Congress,\" London, 1866,\r\nquoted in \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume\r\nII., page 113.) What I meant in my paper on Linum about plants being\r\ndimorphic in function alone, was that they should be divided into two\r\nequal bodies functionally but not structurally different. I have been\r\nmuch interested by what you say on seeds which adhere to the valves\r\nbeing rendered conspicuous. You will see in the new edition of the\r\n\"Origin\" (673/5. \"Origin of Species,\" Edition IV., 1866, page 238. A\r\ndiscussion on the origin of beauty, including the bright colours of\r\nflowers and fruits.) why I have alluded to the beauty and bright colours\r\nof fruit; after writing this it troubled me that I remembered to have\r\nseen brilliantly coloured seed, and your view occurred to me. There is a\r\nspecies of peony in which the inside of the pod is crimson and the seeds\r\ndark purple. I had asked a friend to send me some of these seeds, to\r\nsee if they were covered with anything which could prove attractive to\r\nbirds. I received some seeds the day after receiving your letter, and I\r\nmust own that the fleshy covering is so thin that I can hardly believe\r\nit would lead birds to devour them; and so it was in an analogous case\r\nwith Passiflora gracilis. How is this in the cases mentioned by you? The\r\nwhole case seems to me rather a striking one.\r\n\r\nI wish I had heard of Mikania being a leaf-climber before your paper\r\nwas printed (673/6. See \"Climbing Plants (3rd thousand, 1882), page 116.\r\nMikania and Mutisia both belong to the Compositae. Mikania scandens is a\r\ntwining plant: it is another species which, by its leaf-climbing habit,\r\nsupplies a transition to the tendril-climber Mutisia. F. Muller's\r\npaper is in \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" IX., page 344.), for we thus get a\r\ngood gradation from M. scandens to Mutisia, with its little modified,\r\nleaf-like tendrils.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you can confirm (but render still more wonderful)\r\nHackel's most interesting case of Linope. Huxley told me that he thought\r\nthe case would somehow be explained away.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 674. TO F. MULLER. Down [Received January 24th, 1867].\r\n\r\nI have so much to thank you for that I hardly know how to begin. I have\r\nreceived the bulbils of Oxalis, and your most interesting letter of\r\nOctober 1st. I planted half the bulbs, and will plant the other half\r\nin the spring. The case seems to me very curious, and until trying some\r\nexperiments in crossing I can form no conjecture what the abortion of\r\nthe stamens in so irregular a manner can signify. But I fear from what\r\nyou say the plant will prove sterile, like so many others which increase\r\nlargely by buds of various kinds. Since I asked you about Oxalis, Dr.\r\nHildebrand has published a paper showing that a great number of species\r\nare trimorphic, like Lythrum, but he has tried hardly any experiments.\r\n(674/1. Hildebrand's work, published in the \"Monatsb. d. Akad. d. Wiss.\r\nBerlin,\" 1866, was chiefly on herbarium specimens. His experimental work\r\nwas published in the \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1871.)\r\n\r\nI am particularly obliged for the information and specimens of Cordia\r\n(674/2. Cordiaceae: probably dimorphic.), and shall be most grateful for\r\nseed. I have not heard of any dimorphic species in this family. Hardly\r\nanything in your letter interested me so much as your account and\r\ndrawing of the valves of the pod of one of the Mimoseae with the really\r\nbeautiful seeds. I will send some of these seeds to Kew to be planted.\r\nBut these seeds seem to me to offer a very great difficulty. They do\r\nnot seem hard enough to resist the triturating power of the gizzard of a\r\ngallinaceous bird, though they must resist that of some other birds;\r\nfor the skin is as hard as ivory. I presume that these seeds cannot\r\nbe covered with any attractive pulp? I soaked one of the seeds for ten\r\nhours in warm water, which became only very slightly mucilaginous.\r\nI think I will try whether they will pass through a fowl uninjured.\r\n(674/3. The seeds proved to be those of Adenanthera pavonina. The\r\nsolution of the difficulty is given in the following extract from a\r\nletter to Muller, March 2nd, 1867: \"I wrote to India on the subject,\r\nand I hear from Mr. J. Scott that parrots are eager for the seeds, and,\r\nwonderful as the fact is, can split them open with their beaks; they\r\nfirst collect a large number in their beaks, and then settle themselves\r\nto split them, and in doing so drop many; thus I have no doubt they are\r\ndisseminated, on the same principle that the acorns of our oaks are most\r\nwidely disseminated.\" Possibly a similar explanation may hold good\r\nfor the brightly coloured seeds of Abrus precatorius.) I hope you will\r\nobserve whether any bird devours them; and could you get any young man\r\nto shoot some and observe whether the seeds are found low down in\r\nthe intestines? It would be well worth while to plant such seeds with\r\nundigested seeds for comparison. An opponent of ours might make a\r\ncapital case against us by saying that here beautiful pods and seeds\r\nhave been formed not for the good of the plant, but for the good of\r\nbirds alone. These seeds would make a beautiful bracelet for one of my\r\ndaughters, if I had enough. I may just mention that Euonymus europoeus\r\nis a case in point: the seeds are coated by a thin orange layer, which I\r\nfind is sufficient to cause them to be devoured by birds.\r\n\r\nI have received your paper on Martha [Posoqueria (674/4. \"Bot. Zeitung,\"\r\n1866.)]; it is as wonderful as the most wonderful orchis; Ernst Hackel\r\nbrought me the paper and stayed a day with me. I have seldom seen a\r\nmore pleasant, cordial, and frank man. He is now in Madeira, where he is\r\ngoing to work chiefly on the Medusae. His great work is now published,\r\nand I have a copy; but the german is so difficult I can make out but\r\nlittle of it, and I fear it is too large a work to be translated. Your\r\nfact about the number of seeds in the capsule of the Maxillaria (674/5.\r\nSee \"Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume II., page 115.) came just\r\nat the right time, as I wished to give one or two such facts. Does this\r\norchid produce many capsules? I cannot answer your question about the\r\naerial roots of Catasetum. I hope you have received the new edition\r\nof the \"Origin.\" Your paper on climbing plants (674/6. \"Linn. Soc.\r\nJournal,\" IX., 1867, page 344.) is printed, and I expect in a day or two\r\nto receive the spare copies, and I will send off three copies as before\r\nstated, and will retain some in case you should wish me to send them to\r\nany one in Europe, and will transmit the remainder to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 675. TO F. MULLER. Down [received February 24th, 1867].\r\n\r\nYour letter of November 2nd contained an extraordinary amount of\r\ninteresting matter. What a number of dimorphic plants South Brazil\r\nproduces: you observed in one day as many or more dimorphic genera than\r\nall the botanists in Europe have ever observed. When my present book\r\nis finished I shall write a final paper upon these plants, so that I\r\nam extremely glad to hear of your observations and to see the dried\r\nflowers; nevertheless, I should regret MUCH if I prevented you from\r\npublishing on the subject. Plumbago (675/1. Plumbago has not been shown\r\nto be dimorphic.) is quite new to me, though I had suspected it. It is\r\ncurious how dimorphism prevails by groups throughout the world,\r\nshowing, as I suppose, that it is an ancient character; thus Hedyotis is\r\ndimorphic in India (675/2. Hedyotis was sent to Darwin by F. Muller; it\r\nseems possible, therefore, that Hedyotis was written by mistake for some\r\nother Rubiaceous plant, perhaps Oldenlandia, which John Scott sent him\r\nfrom India.); the two other genera in the same sub-family with Villarsia\r\nare dimorphic in Europe and Ceylon; a sub-genus of Erythroxylon (675/3.\r\nNo doubt Sethia.) is dimorphic in Ceylon, and Oxalis with you and at the\r\nCape of Good Hope. If you can find a dimorphic Oxalis it will be a new\r\npoint, for all known species are trimorphic or monomorphic. The case of\r\nConvolvulus will be new, if proved. I am doubtful about Gesneria (675/4.\r\nNeither Convolvulus nor Gesneria have been shown to be dimorphic.),\r\nand have been often myself deceived by varying length of pistil.\r\nA difference in the size of the pollen-grains would be conclusive\r\nevidence; but in some cases experiments by fertilisation can alone\r\ndecide the point. As yet I know of no case of dimorphism in flowers\r\nwhich are very irregular; such flowers being apparently always\r\nsufficiently visited and crossed by insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 676. TO F. MULLER. Down, April 22nd [1867].\r\n\r\nI am very sorry your papers on climbing plants never reached you. They\r\nmust be lost, but I put the stamps on myself and I am sure they were\r\nright. I despatched on the 20th all the remaining copies, except one for\r\nmyself. Your letter of March 4th contained much interesting matter, but\r\nI have to say this of all your letters. I am particularly glad to hear\r\nthat Oncidium flexuosum (676/1. See \"Animals and Plants,\" Edition II.,\r\nVolume II., page 114. Observations on Oncidium were made by John Scott,\r\nand in Brazil by F. Muller, who \"fertilised above one hundred flowers of\r\nthe above-mentioned Oncidium flexuosum, which is there endemic, with\r\nits own pollen, and with that taken from distinct plants: all the former\r\nwere sterile, whilst those fertilised by pollen from any OTHER PLANT of\r\nthe same species were fertile.') is endemic, for I always thought that\r\nthe cases of self-sterility with orchids in hot-houses might have been\r\ncaused by their unnatural conditions. I am glad, also, to hear of the\r\nother analogous cases, all of which I will give briefly in my book\r\nthat is now printing. The lessened number of good seeds in the\r\nself-fertilising Epidendrums is to a certain extent a new case.\r\nYou suggest the comparison of the growth of plants produced from\r\nself-fertilised and crossed seeds. I began this work last autumn, and\r\nthe result, in some cases, has been very striking; but only, as far as\r\nI can yet judge, with exotic plants which do not get freely crossed by\r\ninsects in this country. In some of these cases it is really a wonderful\r\nphysiological fact to see the difference of growth in the plants\r\nproduced from self-fertilised and crossed seeds, both produced by the\r\nsame parent-plant; the pollen which has been used for the cross having\r\nbeen taken from a distinct plant that grew in the same flower-pot. Many\r\nthanks for the dimorphic Rubiaceous plant. Three of your Plumbagos have\r\ngerminated, but not as yet any of the Lobelias. Have you ever thought of\r\npublishing a work which might contain miscellaneous observations on all\r\nbranches of Natural History, with a short description of the country and\r\nof any excursions which you might take? I feel certain that you might\r\nmake a very valuable and interesting book, for every one of your\r\nletters is so full of good observations. Such books, for instance Bates'\r\n\"Travels on the Amazons,\" are very popular in England. I will give your\r\nobliging offer about Brazilian plants to Dr. Hooker, who was to have\r\ncome here to-day, but has failed. He is an excellent good fellow, as\r\nwell as naturalist. He has lately published a pamphlet, which I think\r\nyou would like to read; and I will try and get a copy and send you.\r\n(676/2. Sir J.D. Hooker's lecture on Insular Floras, given before\r\nthe British Association in August, 1866, is doubtless referred to. It\r\nappeared in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" and was published as a pamphlet\r\nin January, 1867. This fact helps to fix the date of the present\r\nletter.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 677. TO F. MULLER.\r\n\r\n(677/1. The following refers to the curious case of Eschscholtzia\r\ndescribed in \"Cross and Self-Fertilisation,\" pages 343-4. The offspring\r\nof English plants after growing for two generations in Brazil became\r\nself-sterile, while the offspring of Brazilian plants became partly\r\nself-fertile in England.)\r\n\r\nJanuary 30th [1868].\r\n\r\n...The flowers of Eschscholtzia when crossed with pollen from a distinct\r\nplant produced 91 per cent. of capsules; when self-fertilised the\r\nflowers produced only 66 per cent. of capsules. An equal number of\r\ncrossed and self-fertilised capsules contained seed by weight in the\r\nproportion of 100 to 71. Nevertheless, the self-fertilised flowers\r\nproduced an abundance of seed. I enclose a few crossed seeds in hopes\r\nthat you will raise a plant, cover it with a net, and observe whether it\r\nis self-fertile; at the same time allowing several uncovered plants to\r\nproduce capsules, for the sterility formerly observed by you seems to me\r\nvery curious.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 678. TO F. MULLER. Down, November 28th [1868].\r\n\r\nYou end your letter of September 9th by saying that it is a very\r\ndull one; indeed, you make a very great mistake, for it abounds with\r\ninteresting facts and thoughts. Your account of the tameness of the\r\nbirds which apparently have wandered from the interior, is very curious.\r\nBut I must begin on another subject: there has been a great and very\r\nvexatious, but unavoidable delay in the publication of your book.\r\n(678/1. \"Facts and Arguments for Darwin,\" 1869, a translation by the\r\nlate Mr. Dallas of F. Muller's \"Fur Darwin,\" 1864: see Volume I., Letter\r\n227.) Prof. Huxley agrees with me that Mr. Dallas is by far the best\r\ntranslator, but he is much overworked and had not quite finished the\r\ntranslation about a fortnight ago. He has charge of the Museum at York,\r\nand is now trying to get the situation of Assistant Secretary at the\r\nGeological Society; and all the canvassing, etc., and his removal, if\r\nhe gets the place, will, I fear, cause more than a month's delay in the\r\ncompletion of the translation; and this I very much regret.\r\n\r\nI am particularly glad to hear that you intend to repeat my experiments\r\non illegitimate offspring, for no one's observations can be trusted\r\nuntil repeated. You will find the work very troublesome, owing to the\r\ndeath of plants and accidents of all kinds. Some dimorphic plant will\r\nprobably prove too sterile for you to raise offspring; and others too\r\nfertile for much sterility to be expected in their offspring. Primula\r\nis bad on account of the difficulty of deciding which seeds may be\r\nconsidered as good. I have earnestly wished that some one would repeat\r\nthese experiments, but I feared that years would elapse before any\r\none would take the trouble. I received your paper on Bignonia in \"Bot.\r\nZeit.\" and it interested me much. (678/2. See \"Variation of Animals\r\nand Plants,\" Edition II., Volume II., page 117. Fritz Muller's paper,\r\n\"Befruchtungsversuche an Cipo alho (Bignonia),\" \"Botanische Zeitung,\"\r\nSeptember 25th, 1868, page 625, contains an interesting foreshadowing of\r\nthe generalisation arrived at in \"Cross and Self-Fertilisation.\" Muller\r\nwrote: \"Are the three which grow near each other seedlings from the same\r\nmother-plant or perhaps from seeds of the same capsule? Or have they,\r\nfrom growing in the same place and under the same conditions, become so\r\nlike each other that the pollen of one has hardly any more effect on\r\nthe others than their own pollen? Or, on the contrary, were the plants\r\noriginally one--i.e., are they suckers from a single stock, which\r\nhave gained a slight degree of mutual fertility in the course of an\r\nindependent life? Or, lastly, is the result 'ein neckische Zufall,'\"\r\n(The above is a free translation of Muller's words.)) I am convinced\r\nthat if you can prove that a plant growing in a distant place under\r\ndifferent conditions is more effective in fertilisation than one\r\ngrowing close by, you will make a great step in the essence of sexual\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nProf. Asa Gray and Dr. Hooker have been staying here, and, oddly\r\nenough, they knew nothing of your paper on Martha (678/3. F. Muller has\r\ndescribed (\"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1866, page 129) the explosive mechanism by\r\nwhich the pollen is distributed in Martha (Posoqueria) fragrans. He\r\nalso gives an account of the remarkable arrangement for ensuring\r\ncross-fertilisation. See \"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page 131.),\r\nthough the former was aware of the curious movements of the stamens, but\r\nso little understood the structure of the plant that he thought it was\r\nprobably a dimorphic species. Accordingly, I showed them your drawings\r\nand gave them a little lecture, and they were perfectly charmed with\r\nyour account. Hildebrand (678/4. See Letter 206, Volume I.) has repeated\r\nhis experiments on potatoes, and so have I, but this summer with no\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 679. TO F. MULLER. Down, March 14th [1869].\r\n\r\nI received some time ago a very interesting letter from you with many\r\nfacts about Oxalis, and about the non-seeding and spreading of one\r\nspecies. I may mention that our common O. acetosella varies much\r\nin length of pistils and stamens, so that I at first thought it was\r\ncertainly dimorphic, but proved it by experiment not to be so. Boiseria\r\n(679/1. This perhaps refers to Boissiera (Ladizabala).) has after all\r\nseeded well with me when crossed by opposite form, but very sparingly\r\nwhen self-fertilised. Your case of Faramea astonishes me. (679/2. See\r\n\"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page 129. Faramea is placed among the\r\ndimorphic species.) Are you sure there is no mistake? The difference\r\nin size of flower and wonderful difference in size and structure of\r\npollen-grains naturally make me rather sceptical. I never fail to admire\r\nand to be surprised at the number of points to which you attend. I go\r\non slowly at my next book, and though I never am idle, I make but slow\r\nprogress; for I am often interrupted by being unwell, and my subject\r\nof sexual selection has grown into a very large one. I have also had\r\nto correct a new edition of my \"Origin,\" (679/3. The 5th edition.), and\r\nthis has taken me six weeks, for science progresses at railroad speed.\r\nI cannot tell you how rejoiced I am that your book is at last out; for\r\nwhether it sells largely or not, I am certain it will produce a great\r\neffect on all capable judges, though these are few in number.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have just received your letter of January 12th. I am greatly\r\ninterested by what you say on Eschscholtzia; I wish your plants had\r\nsucceeded better. It seems pretty clear that the species is much more\r\nself-sterile under the climate of Brazil than here, and this seems to me\r\nan important result. (679/4. See Letter 677.) I have no spare seeds at\r\npresent, but will send for some from the nurseryman, which, though not\r\nso good for our purpose, will be worth trying. I can send some of my own\r\nin the autumn. You could simply cover up separately two or three single\r\nplants, and see if they will seed without aid,--mine did abundantly.\r\nVery many thanks for seeds of Oxalis: how I wish I had more strength and\r\ntime to carry on these experiments, but when I write in the morning, I\r\nhave hardly heart to do anything in the afternoon. Your grass is most\r\nwonderful. You ought to send account to the \"Bot. Zeitung.\" Could you\r\nnot ascertain whether the barbs are sensitive, and how soon they\r\nbecome spiral in the bud? Your bird is, I have no doubt, the Molothrus\r\nmentioned in my \"Journal of Travels,\" page 52, as representing a North\r\nAmerican species, both with cuckoo-like habits. I know that seeds from\r\nsame spike transmitted to a certain extent their proper qualities; but\r\nas far as I know, no one has hitherto shown how far this holds good, and\r\nthe fact is very interesting. The experiment would be well worth trying\r\nwith flowers bearing different numbers of petals. Your explanation\r\nagrees beautifully with the hypothesis of pangenesis, and delights me.\r\nIf you try other cases, do draw up a paper on the subject of inheritance\r\nof separate flowers for the \"Bot. Zeitung\" or some journal. Most men,\r\nas far as my experience goes, are too ready to publish, but you seem\r\nto enjoy making most interesting observations and discoveries, and are\r\nsadly too slow in publishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 680. TO F. MULLER. Barmouth, July 18th, 1869.\r\n\r\nI received your last letter shortly before leaving home for this place.\r\nOwing to this cause and to having been more unwell than usual I have\r\nbeen very dilatory in writing to you. When I last heard, about six or\r\neight weeks ago, from Mr. Murray, one hundred copies of your book had\r\nbeen sold, and I daresay five hundred may now be sold. (680/1. \"Facts\r\nand Arguments for Darwin,\" 1869: see Volume I., Letter 227.) This will\r\nquite repay me, if not all the money; for I am sure that your book will\r\nhave got into the hands of a good many men capable of understanding it:\r\nindeed, I know that it has. But it is too deep for the general public.\r\nI sent you two or three reviews--one of which, in the \"Athenaeum,\" was\r\nunfavourable; but this journal has abused me, and all who think with me,\r\nfor many years. (680/2. \"Athenaeum,\" 1869, page 431.) I enclose two more\r\nnotices, not that they are worth sending: some other brief notices have\r\nappeared. The case of the Abitulon sterile with some individuals is\r\nremarkable (680/3. \"Bestaubungsversuche an Abutilon-Arten.\" \"Jenaische\r\nZeitschr.\" VII., 1873, page 22.): I believe that I had one plant of\r\nReseda odorata which was fertile with own pollen, but all that I have\r\ntried since were sterile except with pollen from some other individual.\r\nI planted the seeds of the Abitulon, but I fear that they were crushed\r\nin the letter. Your Eschscholtzia plants were growing well when I left\r\nhome, to which place we shall return by the end of this month, and I\r\nwill observe whether they are self-sterile. I sent your curious account\r\nof the monstrous Begonia to the Linnean Society, and I suppose it will\r\nbe published in the \"Journal.\" (680/4. \"On the Modification of the\r\nStamens in a Species of Begonia.\" \"Journ. Linn. Soc.\" XI., 1871, page\r\n472.) I sent the extract about grafted orange trees to the \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle,\" where it appeared. I have lately drawn up some notes for a\r\nFrench translation of my Orchis book: I took out your letters to make an\r\nabstract of your numerous discussions, but I found I had not strength\r\nor time to do so, and this caused me great regret. I have [in the French\r\nedition] alluded to your work, which will also be published in English,\r\nas you will see in my paper, and which I will send you. (680/5. \"Notes\r\non the Fertilisation of Orchids.\" \"Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.\" 1869, Volume\r\nIV., page 141. The paper gives an English version of the notes prepared\r\nfor the French edition of the Orchid book.)\r\n\r\nP.S.--By an odd chance, since I wrote the beginning of this letter, I\r\nhave received one from Dr. Hooker, who has been reading \"Fur Darwin\": he\r\nfinds that he has not knowledge enough for the first part; but says\r\nthat Chapters X. and XI. \"strike me as remarkably good.\" He is also\r\nparticularly struck with one of your highly suggestive remarks in the\r\nnote to page 119. Assuredly all who read your book will greatly profit\r\nby it, and I rejoice that it has appeared in English.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 681. TO F. MULLER. Down, December 1st [1869].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your letter of October 18th, with the curious\r\naccount of Abutilon, and for the seeds. A friend of mine, Mr. Farrer,\r\nhas lately been studying the fertilisation of Passiflora (681/1. See\r\nLetters 701 and 704.), and concluded from the curiously crooked passage\r\ninto the nectary that it could not be fertilised by humming-birds; but\r\nthat Tacsonia was thus fertilised. Therefore I sent him the passage from\r\nyour letter, and I enclose a copy of his answer. If you are inclined to\r\ngratify him by making a few observations on this subject I shall be\r\nmuch obliged, and will send them on to him. I enclose a copy of my rough\r\nnotes on your Eschscholtzia, as you might like to see them. Somebody has\r\nsent me from Germany two papers by you, one with a most curious account\r\nof Alisma (681/2. See Letter 672.), and the other on crustaceans. Your\r\nobservations on the branchiae and heart have interested me extremely.\r\n\r\nAlex. Agassiz has just paid me a visit with his wife. He has been in\r\nEngland two or three months, and is now going to tour over the Continent\r\nto see all the zoologists. We liked him very much. He is a great admirer\r\nof yours, and he tells me that your correspondence and book first\r\nmade him believe in evolution. This must have been a great blow to his\r\nfather, who, as he tells me, is very well, and so vigorous that he can\r\nwork twice as long as he (the son) can.\r\n\r\nDr. Meyer has sent me his translation of Wallace's \"Malay Archipelago,\"\r\nwhich is a valuable work; and as I have no use for the translation,\r\nI will this day forward it to you by post, but, to save postage, via\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 682. TO F. MULLER. Down, May 12th [1870].\r\n\r\nI thank you for your two letters of December 15th and March 29th, both\r\nabounding with curious facts. I have been particularly glad to hear in\r\nyour last about the Eschscholtzia (682/1. See Letter 677.); for I am now\r\nrearing crossed and self-fertilised plants, in antagonism to each other,\r\nfrom your semi-sterile plants so that I may compare this comparative\r\ngrowth with that of the offspring of English fertile plants. I have\r\nforwarded your postscript about Passiflora, with the seeds, to Mr.\r\nFarrer, who I am sure will be greatly obliged to you; the turning up of\r\nthe pendant flower plainly indicates some adaptation. When I next go to\r\nLondon I will take up the specimens of butterflies, and show them to\r\nMr. Butler, of the British Museum, who is a learned lepidopterist\r\nand interested on the subject. This reminds me to ask you whether you\r\nreceived my letter [asking] about the ticking butterfly, described at\r\npage 33 of my \"Journal of Researches\"; viz., whether the sound is in\r\nanyway sexual? Perhaps the species does not inhabit your island. (682/2.\r\nPapilio feronia, a Brazilian species capable of making \"a clicking\r\nnoise, similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a\r\nspring catch.\"--\"Journal,\" 1879, page 34.)\r\n\r\nThe case described in your last letter of the trimorphic monocotyledon\r\nPontederia is grand. (682/3. This case interested Darwin as the only\r\ninstance of heterostylism in Monocotyledons. See \"Forms of Flowers,\"\r\nEdition II., page 183. F. Muller's paper is in the \"Jenaische\r\nZeitschrift,\" 1871.) I wonder whether I shall ever have time to recur\r\nto this subject; I hope I may, for I have a good deal of unpublished\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThank you for telling me about the first-formed flower having additional\r\npetals, stamens, carpels, etc., for it is a possible means of transition\r\nof form; it seems also connected with the fact on which I have insisted\r\nof peloric flowers being so often terminal. As pelorism is strongly\r\ninherited (and [I] have just got a curious case of this in a leguminous\r\nplant from India), would it not be worth while to fertilise some of\r\nyour early flowers having additional organs with pollen from a similar\r\nflower, and see whether you could not make a race thus characterised?\r\n(682/4. See Letters 588, 589. Also \"Variation under Domestication,\"\r\nEdition II., Volume I., pages 388-9.) Some of your Abutilons have\r\ngerminated, but I have been very unfortunate with most of your seed.\r\n\r\nYou will remember having given me in a former letter an account of\r\na very curious popular belief in regard to the subsequent progeny\r\nof asses, which have borne mules; and now I have another case almost\r\nexactly like that of Lord Morton's mare, in which it is said the shape\r\nof the hoofs in the subsequent progeny are affected. (Pangenesis will\r\nturn out true some day!) (682/5. See \"Animals and Plants,\" Edition\r\nII., Volume I., page 435. For recent work on telegony see Ewart's\r\n\"Experimental Investigations on Telegony,\" \"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" 1899.\r\nA good account of the subject is given in the \"Quarterly Review,\" 1899,\r\npage 404. See also Letter 275, Volume I.)\r\n\r\nA few months ago I received an interesting letter and paper from your\r\nbrother, who has taken up a new and good line of investigation, viz.,\r\nthe adaptation in insects for the fertilisation of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe only scientific man I have seen for several months is Kolliker, who\r\ncame here with Gunther, and whom I liked extremely.\r\n\r\nI am working away very hard at my book on man and on sexual selection,\r\nbut I do not suppose I shall go to press till late in the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 683. TO F. MULLER. Down, January 1st, 1874.\r\n\r\nNo doubt I owe to your kindness two pamphlets received a few days ago,\r\nwhich have interested me in an extraordinary degree. (683/1. This refers\r\nto F. Muller's \"Bestaubungsversuche an Abutilon-Arten\" in the \"Jenaische\r\nZeitschr.\" Volume VII., which are thus referred to by Darwin (\"Cross\r\nand Self Fert.\" pages 305-6): \"Fritz Muller has shown by his valuable\r\nexperiments on hybrid Abutilons, that the union of brothers and sisters,\r\nparents and children, and of other near relations is highly injurious to\r\nthe fertility of the offspring.\" The Termite paper is in the same volume\r\n(viz., VII.) of the \"Jenaische Zeitschr.\") It is quite new to me what\r\nyou show about the effects of relationship in hybrids--that is to say,\r\nas far as direct proof is concerned. I felt hardly any doubt on the\r\nsubject, from the fact of hybrids becoming more fertile when grown in\r\nnumber in nursery gardens, exactly the reverse of what occurred with\r\nGartner. (683/2. When many hybrids are grown together the pollination by\r\nnear relatives is minimised.) The paper on Termites is even still more\r\ninteresting, and the analogy with cleistogene flowers is wonderful.\r\n(683/3. On the back of his copy of Muller's paper Darwin wrote: \"There\r\nexist imperfectly developed male and female Termites, with wings much\r\nshorter than those of queen and king, which serve to continue the\r\nspecies if a fully developed king and queen do not after swarming (which\r\nno doubt is for an occasional cross) enter [the] nest. Curiously like\r\ncleistogamic flowers.\") The manner in which you refer to to my chapter\r\non crossing is one of the most elegant compliments which I have ever\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nI have directed to be sent to you Belt's \"Nicaragua,\" which seems to me\r\nthe best Natural History book of travels ever published. Pray look to\r\nwhat he says about the leaf-carrying ant storing the leaves up in a\r\nminced state to generate mycelium, on which he supposes that the larvae\r\nfeed. Now, could you open the stomachs of these ants and examine the\r\ncontents, so as to prove or disprove this remarkable hypothesis? (683/4.\r\nThe hypothesis has been completely confirmed by the researches of\r\nMoller, a nephew of F. Muller's: see his \"Brasilische Pilzblumen\"\r\n(\"Botan. Mittheilgn. aus den Tropen,\" hrsg. von A.F.W. Schimper, Heft\r\n7).)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 684. TO F. MULLER. Down, May 9th, 1877.\r\n\r\nI have been particularly glad to receive your letter of March 25th on\r\nPontederia, for I am now printing a small book on heterostyled plants,\r\nand on some allied subjects. I feel sure you will not object to my\r\ngiving a short account of the flowers of the new species which you have\r\nsent me. I am the more anxious to do so as a writer in the United States\r\nhas described a species, and seems to doubt whether it is heterostyled,\r\nfor he thinks the difference in the length of the pistil depends merely\r\non its growth! In my new book I shall use all the information and\r\nspecimens which you have sent me with respect to the heterostyled\r\nplants, and your published notices.\r\n\r\nOne chapter will be devoted to cleistogamic species, and I will just\r\nnotice your new grass case. My son Francis desires me to thank you much\r\nfor your kindness with respect to the plants which bury their seeds.\r\n\r\nI never fail to feel astonished, when I receive one of your letters, at\r\nthe number of new facts you are continually observing. With respect to\r\nthe great supposed subterranean animal, may not the belief have arisen\r\nfrom the natives having seen large skeletons embedded in cliffs? I\r\nremember finding on the banks of the Parana a skeleton of a Mastodon,\r\nand the Gauchos concluded that it was a borrowing animal like the\r\nBizcacha. (684/1. On the supposed existence in Patagonia of a gigantic\r\nland-sloth, see \"Natural Science,\" XIII., 1898, page 288, where\r\nAmeghino's discovery of the skin of Neomylodon listai was practically\r\nfirst made known, since his privately published pamphlet was\r\nnot generally seen. The animal was afterwards identified with a\r\nGlossotherium, closely allied to Owen's G. Darwini, which has been named\r\nGlossotherium listai or Grypotherium domesticum. For a good account of\r\nthe discoveries see Smith Woodward in \"Natural Science,\" XV., 1899, page\r\n351, where the literature is given.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 685. TO F. MULLER. Down, May 14th [1877].\r\n\r\nI wrote to you a few days ago to thank you about Pontederia, and now\r\nI am going to ask you to add one more to the many kindnesses which you\r\nhave done for me. I have made many observations on the waxy secretion on\r\nleaves which throw off water (e.g., cabbage, Tropoeolum), and I am now\r\ngoing to continue my observations. Does any sensitive species of Mimosa\r\ngrow in your neighbourhood? If so, will you observe whether the leaflets\r\nkeep shut during long-continued warm rain. I find that the leaflets open\r\nif they are continuously syringed with water at a temperature of about\r\n19 deg C., but if the water is at a temperature of 33-35 deg C., they\r\nkeep shut for more than two hours, and probably longer. If the plant is\r\ncontinuously shaken so as to imitate wind the leaflets soon open. How is\r\nthis with the native plants during a windy day? I find that some other\r\nplants--for instance, Desmodium and Cassia--when syringed with water,\r\nplace their leaves so that the drops fall quickly off; the position\r\nassumed differing somewhat from that in the so-called sleep. Would you\r\nbe so kind as to observe whether any [other] plants place their leaves\r\nduring rain so as to shoot off the water; and if there are any such\r\nI should be very glad of a leaf or two to ascertain whether they are\r\ncoated with a waxy secretion. (685/1. See Letters 737-41.)\r\n\r\nThere is another and very different subject, about which I intend to\r\nwrite, and should be very glad of a little information. Are earthworms\r\n(Lumbricus) common in S. Brazil (685/2. F. Muller's reply is given in\r\n\"Vegetable Mould,\" page 122.), and do they throw up on the surface of\r\nthe ground numerous castings or vermicular masses such as we so commonly\r\nsee in Europe? Are such castings found in the forests beneath the dead\r\nwithered leaves? I am sure I can trust to your kindness to forgive me\r\nfor asking you so many questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 686. TO F. MULLER. Down, July 24th, 1878.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the five kinds of seeds; all have germinated, and the\r\nCassia seedlings have interested me much, and I daresay that I shall\r\nfind something curious in the other plants. Nor have I alone profited,\r\nfor Sir J. Hooker, who was here on Sunday, was very glad of some of the\r\nseeds for Kew. I am particularly obliged for the information about the\r\nearthworms. I suppose the soil in your forests is very loose, for in\r\nground which has lately been dug in England the worms do not come to the\r\nsurface, but deposit their castings in the midst of the loose soil.\r\n\r\nI have some grand plants (and I formerly sent seeds to Kew) of the\r\ncleistogamic grass, but they show no signs of producing flowers of any\r\nkind as yet. Your case of the panicle with open flowers being sterile\r\nis parallel to that of Leersia oryzoides. I have always fancied that\r\ncross-fertilisation would perhaps make such panicles fertile. (686/1.\r\nThe meaning of this sentence is somewhat obscure. Darwin apparently\r\nimplies that the perfect flowers, borne on the panicles which\r\noccasionally emerge from the sheath, might be fertile if pollinated from\r\nanother individual. See \"Forms of Flowers,\" page 334.)\r\n\r\nI am working away as hard as I can at all the multifarious kinds of\r\nmovements of plants, and am trying to reduce them to some simple rules,\r\nbut whether I shall succeed I do not know.\r\n\r\nI have sent the curious lepidopteron case to Mr. Meldola.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 687. F. MULLER TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(687/1. In November, 1880, on receipt of an account of a flood in Brazil\r\nfrom which Fritz Muller had barely escaped with his life (\"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., 242); Darwin immediately wrote to Hermann Muller begging\r\nto be allowed to help in making good any loss in books or scientific\r\ninstruments that his brother had sustained. It is this offer of help\r\nthat is referred to in the first paragraph of the following letter:\r\nDarwin repeats the offer in Letter 690.)\r\n\r\nBlumenau, Sa Catharina, Brazil, January 9th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI do not know how to express [to] you my deep heartfelt gratitude for\r\nthe generous offer which you made to my brother on hearing of the\r\nlate dreadful flood of the Itajahy. From you, dear sir, I should have\r\naccepted assistance without hesitation if I had been in need of it; but\r\nfortunately, though we had to leave our house for more than a week, and\r\non returning found it badly damaged, my losses have not been very great.\r\n\r\nI must thank you also for your wonderful book on the movements of\r\nplants, which arrived here on New Year's Day. I think nobody else will\r\nhave been delighted more than I was with the results which you have\r\narrived at by so many admirably conducted experiments and observations;\r\nsince I observed the spontaneous revolving movement of Alisma I had seen\r\nsimilar movements in so many and so different plants that I felt much\r\ninclined to consider spontaneous revolving movement or circumnutation as\r\ncommon to all plants and the movements of climbing plants as a\r\nspecial modification of that general phenomenon. And this you have now\r\nconvincingly, nay, superabundantly, proved to be the case.\r\n\r\nI was much struck with the fact that with you Maranta did not sleep for\r\ntwo nights after having its leaves violently shaken by wind, for here we\r\nhave very cold nights only after storms from the west or south-west,\r\nand it would be very strange if the leaves of our numerous species of\r\nMarantaceae should be prevented by these storms to assume their usual\r\nnocturnal position, just when nocturnal radiation was most to be feared.\r\nIt is rather strange, also, that Phaseolus vulgaris should not sleep\r\nduring the early part of the summer, when the leaves are most likely to\r\nbe injured during cold nights. On the contrary, it would not do any harm\r\nto many sub-tropical plants, that their leaves must be well illuminated\r\nduring the day in order that they may assume at night a vertical\r\nposition; for, in our climate at least, cold nights are always preceded\r\nby sunny days.\r\n\r\nOf nearly allied plants sleeping very differently I can give you\r\nsome more instances. In the genus Olyra (at least, in the one species\r\nobserved by me) the leaves bend down vertically at night; now,\r\nin Endlicher's \"Genera plantarum\" this genus immediately precedes\r\nStrephium, the leaves of which you saw rising vertically.\r\n\r\nIn one of two species of Phyllanthus, growing as weeds near my house,\r\nthe leaves of the erect branches bend upwards at night, while in the\r\nsecond species, with horizontal branches, they sleep like those of\r\nPhyllanthus Niruri or of Cassia. In this second species the tips of\r\nthe branches also are curled downwards at night, by which movement\r\nthe youngest leaves are yet better protected. From their vertical\r\nnyctitropic position the leaves of this Phyllanthus might return to\r\nhorizontality, traversing 90 deg, in two ways, either to their own or to\r\nthe opposite side of the branch; on the latter way no rotation would be\r\nrequired, while on the former each leaf must rotate on its own axis in\r\norder that its upper surface may be turned upwards. Thus the way to the\r\nwrong side appears to be even less troublesome. And indeed, in some rare\r\ncases I have seen three, four or even almost all the leaves of one side\r\nof a branch horizontally expanded on the opposite side, with their upper\r\nsurfaces closely appressed to the lower surfaces of the leaves of that\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThis Phyllanthus agrees with Cassia not only in its manner of sleeping,\r\nbut also by its leaves being paraheliotropic. (687/2. Paraheliotropism\r\nis the movement by which some leaves temporarily direct their edges to\r\nthe source of light. See \"Movements of Plants,\" page 445.) Like those of\r\nsome Cassiae its leaves take an almost perfectly vertical position, when\r\nat noon, on a summer day, the sun is nearly in the zenith; but I doubt\r\nwhether this paraheliotropism will be observable in England. To-day,\r\nthough continuing to be fully exposed to the sun, at 3 p.m. the leaves\r\nhad already returned to a nearly horizontal position. As soon as there\r\nare ripe seeds I will send you some; of our other species of Phyllanthus\r\nI enclose a few seeds in this letter.\r\n\r\nIn several species of Hedychium the lateral halves of the leaves when\r\nexposed to bright sunshine, bend downwards so that the lateral margins\r\nmeet. It is curious that a hybrid Hedychium in my garden shows scarcely\r\nany trace of this paraheliotropism, while both the parent species are\r\nvery paraheliotropic.\r\n\r\nMight not the inequality of the cotyledons of Citrus and of Pachira be\r\nattributed to the pressure, which the several embryos enclosed in the\r\nsame seed exert upon each other? I do not know Pachira aquatica, but\r\n[in] a species, of which I have a tree in my garden, all the seeds\r\nare polyembryonic, and so were almost all the seeds of Citrus which I\r\nexamined. With Coffea arabica also seeds including two embryos are\r\nnot very rare; but I have not yet observed whether in this case the\r\ncotyledons be inequal.\r\n\r\nI repeated to-day Duval-Jouve's measurements on Bryophyllum calycinum\r\n(687/3. \"Power of Movement in Plants,\" page 237. F.

TO F. MULLER. Down, February 23rd, 1881.\r\n\r\nYour letter has interested me greatly, as have so many during many past\r\nyears. I thought that you would not object to my publishing in \"Nature\"\r\n(688/1. \"Nature,\" March 3rd, 1881, page 409.) some of the more striking\r\nfacts about the movements of plants, with a few remarks added to show\r\nthe bearing of the facts. The case of the Phyllanthus (688/2. See\r\nLetter 687.), which turns up its leaves on the wrong side, is most\r\nextraordinary and ought to be further investigated. Do the leaflets\r\nsleep on the following night in the usual manner? Do the same leaflets\r\non successive nights move in the same strange manner? I was particularly\r\nglad to hear of the strongly marked cases of paraheliotropism. I shall\r\nlook out with much interest for the publication about the figs. (688/3.\r\nF. Muller published on Caprification in \"Kosmos,\" 1882.) The creatures\r\nwhich you sketch are marvellous, and I should not have guessed that they\r\nwere hymenoptera. Thirty or forty years ago I read all that I could find\r\nabout caprification, and was utterly puzzled. I suggested to Dr.\r\nCruger in Trinidad to investigate the wild figs, in relation to their\r\ncross-fertilisation, and just before he died he wrote that he had\r\narrived at some very curious results, but he never published, as I\r\nbelieve, on the subject.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad that the inundation did not so greatly injure your\r\nscientific property, though it would have been a real pleasure to me to\r\nhave been allowed to have replaced your scientific apparatus. (688/4.\r\nSee Letter 687.) I do not believe that there is any one in the world who\r\nadmires your zeal in science and wonderful powers of observation more\r\nthan I do. I venture to say this, as I feel myself a very old man, who\r\nprobably will not last much longer.\r\n\r\nP.S.--With respect to Phyllanthus, I think that it would be a good\r\nexperiment to cut off most of the leaflets on one side of the petiole,\r\nas soon as they are asleep and vertically dependent; when the pressure\r\nis thus removed, the opposite leaflets will perhaps bend beyond their\r\nvertically dependent position; if not, the main petiole might be a\r\nlittle twisted so that the upper surfaces of the dependent and now\r\nunprotected leaflets should face obliquely the sky when the morning\r\ncomes. In this case diaheliotropism would perhaps conquer the ordinary\r\nmovements of the leaves when they awake, and [assume] their diurnal\r\nhorizontal position. As the leaflets are alternate, and as the upper\r\nsurface will be somewhat exposed to the dawning light, it is perhaps\r\ndiaheliotropism which explains your extraordinary case.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 689. TO F. MULLER. Down, April 12th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI have delayed answering your last letter of February 25th, as I was\r\njust sending to the printers the MS. of a very little book on the habits\r\nof earthworms, of which I will of course send you a copy when published.\r\nI have been very much interested by your new facts on paraheliotropism,\r\nas I think that they justify my giving a name to this kind of movement,\r\nabout which I long doubted. I have this morning drawn up an account of\r\nyour observations, which I will send in a few days to \"Nature.\" (689/1.\r\n\"Nature,\" 1881, page 603. Curious facts are given on the movements\r\nof Cassia, Phyllanthus, sp., Desmodium sp. Cassia takes up a sunlight\r\nposition unlike its own characteristic night-position, but resembling\r\nrather that of Haematoxylon (see \"Power of Movement,\" figure 153, page\r\n369). One species of Phyllanthus takes up in sunshine the nyctitropic\r\nattitude of another species. And the same sort of relation occurs in the\r\ngenus Bauhinia.) I have thought that you would not object to my giving\r\nprecedence to paraheliotropism, which has been so little noticed. I will\r\nsend you a copy of \"Nature\" when published. I am glad that I was not\r\nin too great a hurry in publishing about Lagerstroemia. (689/2.\r\nLagerstraemia was doubtfully placed among the heterostyled plants\r\n(\"Forms of Flowers,\" page 167). F. Muller's observations showed that a\r\ntotally different interpretation of the two sizes of stamen is possible.\r\nNamely, that one set serves merely to attract pollen-collecting bees,\r\nwho in the act of visiting the flowers transfer the pollen of the longer\r\nstamens to other flowers. A case of this sort in Heeria, a Melastomad,\r\nwas described by Muller (\"Nature,\" August 4th, 1881, page 308), and the\r\nview was applied to the cases of Lagerstroemia and Heteranthera at\r\na later date (\"Nature,\" 1883, page 364). See Letters 620-30.) I have\r\nprocured some plants of Melastomaceae, but I fear that they will not\r\nflower for two years, and I may be in my grave before I can repeat my\r\ntrials. As far as I can imperfectly judge from my observations, the\r\ndifference in colour of the anthers in this family depends on one set\r\nof anthers being partially aborted. I wrote to Kew to get plants with\r\ndifferently coloured anthers, but I learnt very little, as describers of\r\ndried plants do not attend to such points. I have, however, sowed seeds\r\nof two kinds, suggested to me as probable. I have, therefore, been\r\nextremely glad to receive the seeds of Heteranthera reniformis. As far\r\nas I can make out it is an aquatic plant; and whether I shall succeed\r\nin getting it to flower is doubtful. Will you be so kind as to send me\r\na postcard telling me in what kind of station it grows. In the course\r\nof next autumn or winter, I think that I shall put together my notes (if\r\nthey seem worth publishing) on the use or meaning of \"bloom\" (689/3.\r\nSee Letters 736-40.), or the waxy secretion which makes some leaves\r\nglaucous. I think that I told you that my experiments had led me to\r\nsuspect that the movement of the leaves of Mimosa, Desmodium and Cassia,\r\nwhen shaken and syringed, was to shoot off the drops of water. If you\r\nare caught in heavy rain, I should be very much obliged if you would\r\nkeep this notion in your mind, and look to the position of such leaves.\r\nYou have such wonderful powers of observation that your opinion would be\r\nmore valued by me than that of any other man. I have among my notes one\r\nletter from you on the subject, but I forget its purport. I hope, also,\r\nthat you may be led to follow up your very ingenious and novel view\r\non the two-coloured anthers or pollen, and observe which kind is most\r\ngathered by bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 690. TO F. MULLER. [Patterdale], June 21st, 1881.\r\n\r\nI should be much obliged if you could without much trouble send me seeds\r\nof any heterostyled herbaceous plants (i.e. a species which would\r\nflower soon), as it would be easy work for me to raise some illegitimate\r\nseedlings to test their degree of infertility. The plant ought not\r\nto have very small flowers. I hope that you received the copies of\r\n\"Nature,\" with extracts from your interesting letters (690/1. \"Nature,\"\r\nMarch 3rd, 1881, Volume XXIII., page 409, contains a letter from C.\r\nDarwin on \"Movements of Plants,\" with extracts from Fritz Muller's\r\nletter. Another letter, \"On the Movements of Leaves,\" was published in\r\n\"Nature,\" April 28th, 1881, page 603, with notes on leaf-movements sent\r\nto Darwin by Muller.), and I was glad to see a notice in \"Kosmos\" on\r\nPhyllanthus. (690/2. \"Verirrte Blatter,\" by Fritz Muller (\"Kosmos,\"\r\nVolume V., page 141, 1881). In this article an account is given of a\r\nspecies of Phyllanthus, a weed in Muller's garden. See Letter 687.) I\r\nam writing this note away from my home, but before I left I had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing Phyllanthus sleeping. Some of the seeds which\r\nyou so kindly sent me would not germinate, or had not then germinated.\r\nI received a letter yesterday from Dr. Breitenbach, and he tells me\r\nthat you lost many of your books in the desolating flood from which you\r\nsuffered. Forgive me, but why should you not order, through your brother\r\nHermann, books, etc., to the amount of 100 pounds, and I would send\r\na cheque to him as soon as I heard the exact amount? This would be no\r\ninconvenience to me; on the contrary, it would be an honour and lasting\r\npleasure to me to have aided you in your invaluable scientific work to\r\nthis small and trifling extent. (690/3. See Letter 687, also \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., page 242.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 691. TO F. MULLER.\r\n\r\n(691/1. The following extract from a letter to F. Muller shows what was\r\nthe nature of Darwin's interest in the effect of carbonate of ammonia on\r\nroots, etc. He was, we think, wrong in adhering to the belief that the\r\nmovements of aggregated masses are of an amoeboid nature. The masses\r\nchange shape, just as clouds do under the moulding action of the wind.\r\nIn the plant cell the moulding agent is the flowing protoplasm, but the\r\nmasses themselves are passive.)\r\n\r\nSeptember 10th, 1881.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you may remember that I described in \"Insectivorous Plants\"\r\na really curious phenomenon, which I called the aggregation of the\r\nprotoplasm in the cells of the tentacles. None of the great German\r\nbotanists will admit that the moving masses are composed of protoplasm,\r\nthough it is astonishing to me that any one could watch the movement\r\nand doubt its nature. But these doubts have led me to observe analogous\r\nfacts, and I hope to succeed in proving my case.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 692. TO F. MULLER. Down, November 13th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI received a few days ago a small box (registered) containing dried\r\nflower-heads with brown seeds somewhat sculptured on the sides. There\r\nwas no name, and I should be much obliged if some time you would tell me\r\nwhat these seeds are. I have planted them.\r\n\r\nI sent you some time ago my little book on earthworms, which, though\r\nof no importance, has been largely read in England. I have little or\r\nnothing to tell you about myself. I have for a couple of months been\r\nobserving the effects of carbonate of ammonia on chlorophyll and on the\r\nroots of certain plants (692/1. Published under the title \"The Action of\r\nCarbonate of Ammonia on the Roots of Certain Plants and on Chlorophyll\r\nBodies,\" \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" XIX., 1882, pages 239-61, 262-84.), but the\r\nsubject is too difficult for me, and I cannot understand the meaning of\r\nsome strange facts which I have observed. The mere recording new facts\r\nis but dull work.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wiesner has published a book (692/2. See Letter 763.), giving\r\na different explanation to almost every fact which I have given in my\r\n\"Power of Movement in Plants.\" I am glad to say that he admits that\r\nalmost all my statements are true. I am convinced that many of his\r\ninterpretations of the facts are wrong, and I am glad to hear that\r\nProfessor Pfeffer is of the same opinion; but I believe that he is\r\nright and I wrong on some points. I have not the courage to retry all my\r\nexperiments, but I hope to get my son Francis to try some fresh ones to\r\ntest Wiesner's explanations. But I do not know why I have troubled you\r\nwith all this.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 693. TO F. MULLER. [4, Bryanston Street], December 19th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI hope that you may find time to go on with your experiments on such\r\nplants as Lagerstroemia, mentioned in your letter of October 29th, for\r\nI believe you will arrive at new and curious results, more especially if\r\nyou can raise two sets of seedlings from the two kinds of pollen.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the facts about the effect of rain and mud in relation\r\nto the waxy secretion. I have observed many instances of the lower side\r\nbeing protected better than the upper side, in the case, as I believe,\r\nof bushes and trees, so that the advantage in low-growing plants is\r\nprobably only an incidental one. (693/1. The meaning is here obscure: it\r\nappears to us that the significance of bloom on the lower surface of the\r\nleaves of both trees and herbs depends on the frequency with which all\r\nor a majority of the stomata are on the lower surface--where they are\r\nbetter protected from wet (even without the help of bloom) than on the\r\nexposed upper surface. On the correlation between bloom and stomata, see\r\nFrancis Darwin \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" XXII., page 99.) As I am writing away\r\nfrom my home, I have been unwilling to try more than one leaf of the\r\nPassiflora, and this came out of the water quite dry on the lower\r\nsurface and quite wet on the upper. I have not yet begun to put my notes\r\ntogether on this subject, and do not at all know whether I shall be able\r\nto make much of it. The oddest little fact which I have observed is that\r\nwith Trifolium resupinatum, one half of the leaf (I think the right-hand\r\nside, when the leaf is viewed from the apex) is protected by waxy\r\nsecretion, and not the other half (693/2. In the above passage \"leaf\"\r\nshould be \"leaflet\": for a figure of Trifolium resupinatum see Letter\r\n740.); so that when the leaf is dipped into water, exactly half the leaf\r\ncomes out dry and half wet. What the meaning of this can be I cannot\r\neven conjecture. I read last night your very interesting article in\r\n\"Kosmos\" on Crotalaria, and so was very glad to see the dried leaves\r\nsent by you: it seems to me a very curious case. I rather doubt whether\r\nit will apply to Lupinus, for, unless my memory deceives me, all the\r\nleaves of the same plant sometimes behaved in the same manner; but I\r\nwill try and get some of the same seeds of the Lupinus, and sow them in\r\nthe spring. Old age, however, is telling on me, and it troubles me to\r\nhave more than one subject at a time on hand.\r\n\r\n(693/3. In a letter to F. Muller (September 10, 1881) occurs a sentence\r\nwhich may appropriately close this series: \"I often feel rather ashamed\r\nof myself for asking for so many things from you, and for taking up so\r\nmuch of your valuable time, but I can assure you that I feel grateful.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n2.XI.III. MISCELLANEOUS, 1868-1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 694. TO G. BENTHAM. Down, April 22nd, 1868.\r\n\r\nI have been extremely much pleased by your letter, and I take it as\r\na very great compliment that you should have written to me at such\r\nlength...I am not at all surprised that you cannot digest pangenesis:\r\nit is enough to give any one an indigestion; but to my mind the idea\r\nhas been an immense relief, as I could not endure to keep so many large\r\nclasses of facts all floating loose in my mind without some thread of\r\nconnection to tie them together in a tangible method.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the men who have recently written on the crossing\r\nof plants, I can at present remember only Hildebrand, Fritz Muller,\r\nDelpino, and G. Henslow; but I think there are others. I feel sure that\r\nHildebrand is a very good observer, for I have read all his papers, and\r\nduring the last twenty years I have made unpublished observations on\r\nmany of the plants which he describes. [Most of the criticisms which I\r\nsometimes meet with in French works against the frequency of crossing I\r\nam certain are the result of mere ignorance. I have never hitherto found\r\nthe rule to fail that when an author describes the structure of a flower\r\nas specially adapted for self-fertilisation, it is really adapted for\r\ncrossing. The Fumariaceae offer a good instance of this, and Treviranus\r\nthrew this order in my teeth; but in Corydalis Hildebrand shows how\r\nutterly false the idea of self-fertilisation is. This author's paper\r\non Salvia (694/1. Hildebrand, \"Pringsheim's Jahrbucher,\" IV.) is really\r\nworth reading, and I have observed some species, and know that he is\r\naccurate]. (694/2. The passage within [] was published in the \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" III., page 279.) Judging from a long review in the \"Bot.\r\nZeitung\", and from what I know of some the plants, I believe Delpino's\r\narticle especially on the Apocynaea, is excellent; but I cannot read\r\nItalian. (694/3. Hildebrand's paper in the \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1867, refers\r\nto Delpino's work on the Asclepiads, Apocyneae and other Orders.)\r\nPerhaps you would like just to glance at such pamphlets as I can lay my\r\nhands on, and therefore I will send them, as if you do not care to see\r\nthem you can return them at once; and this will cause you less trouble\r\nthan writing to say you do not care to see them. With respect to\r\nPrimula, and one point about which I feel positive is that the Bardfield\r\nand common oxlips are fundamentally distinct plants, and that the\r\ncommon oxlip is a sterile hybrid. (694/4. For a general account of\r\nthe Bardfield oxlip (Primula elatior) see Miller Christy, \"Linn. Soc.\r\nJourn.\" Volume XXXIII., page 172, 1897.) I have never heard of the\r\ncommon oxlip being found in great abundance anywhere, and some amount\r\nof difference in number might depend on so small a circumstance as the\r\npresence of some moth which habitually sucked the primrose and cowslip.\r\nTo return to the subject of crossing: I am experimenting on a very large\r\nscale on the difference in power and growth between plants raised from\r\nself-fertilised and crossed seeds, and it is no exaggeration to say that\r\nthe difference in growth and vigour is sometimes truly wonderful. Lyell,\r\nHuxley, and Hooker have seen some of my plants, and been astonished; and\r\nI should much like to show them to you. I always supposed until lately\r\nthat no evil effects would be visible until after several generations\r\nof self-fertilisation, but now I see that one generation sometimes\r\nsuffices, and the existence of dimorphic plants and all the wonderful\r\ncontrivances of orchids are quite intelligible to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 695. TO T.H. FARRER (Lord Farrer). Down, June 5th, 1868.\r\n\r\nI must write a line to cry peccavi. I have seen the action in Ophrys\r\nexactly as you describe, and am thoroughly ashamed of my inaccuracy.\r\n(695/1. See \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page 46, where\r\nLord Farrer's observations on the movement of the pollinia in Ophrys\r\nmuscifera are given.) I find that the pollinia do not move if kept in a\r\nvery damp atmosphere under a glass; so that it is just possible, though\r\nvery improbable, that I may have observed them during a very damp day.\r\n\r\nI am not much surprised that I overlooked the movement in Habenaria, as\r\nit takes so long. (695/2. This refers to Peristylus viridis, sometimes\r\nknown as Habenaria viridis. Lord Farrer's observations are given in\r\n\"Fertilisation of Orchids,\" Edition II., page 63.)\r\n\r\nI am glad you have seen Listera; it requires to be seen to believe in\r\nthe co-ordination in the position of the parts, the irritability,\r\nand the chemical nature of the viscid fluid. This reminds me that\r\nI carefully described to Huxley the shooting out of the pollinia in\r\nCatasetum, and received for an answer, \"Do you really think that I can\r\nbelieve all that!\" (695/3. See Letter 665.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 696. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 2nd, 1868.\r\n\r\nIt is a splendid scheme, and if you make only a beginning on a \"Flora,\"\r\nwhich shall serve as an index to all papers on curious points in the\r\nlife-history of plants, you will do an inestimable good service. Quite\r\nrecently I was asked by a man how he could find out what was known on\r\nvarious biological points in our plants, and I answered that I knew of\r\nno such book, and that he might ask half a dozen botanists before one\r\nwould chance to remember what had been published on this or that point.\r\nNot long ago another man, who had been experimenting on the quasi-bulbs\r\non the leaves of Cardamine, wrote to me to complain that he could not\r\nfind out what was known on the subject. It is almost certain that some\r\nearly or even advanced students, if they found in their \"Flora\" a\r\nline or two on various curious points, with references for further\r\ninvestigation, would be led to make further observations. For instance,\r\na reference to the viscid threads emitted by the seeds of Compositae, to\r\nthe apparatus (if it has been described) by which Oxalis spurts out its\r\nseeds, to the sensitiveness of the young leaves of Oxalis acetosella\r\nwith reference to O. sensitiva. Under Lathyrus nissolia it would [be]\r\nbetter to refer to my hypothetical explanation of the grass-like leaves\r\nthan to nothing. (696/1. No doubt the view given in \"Climbing Plants,\"\r\npage 201, that L. nissolia has been evolved from a form like L. aphaca.)\r\nUnder a twining plant you might say that the upper part of the shoot\r\nsteadily revolves with or against the sun, and so, when it strikes\r\nagainst any object it turns to the right or left, as the case may be.\r\nIf, again, references were given to the parasitism of Euphrasia,\r\netc., how likely it would be that some young man would go on with the\r\ninvestigation; and so with endless other facts. I am quite enthusiastic\r\nabout your idea; it is a grand idea to make a \"Flora\" a guide for\r\nknowledge already acquired and to be acquired. I have amused myself by\r\nspeculating what an enormous number of subjects ought to be introduced\r\ninto a Eutopian (696/2. A mis-spelling of Utopian.) Flora, on the\r\nquickness of the germination of the seeds, on their means of dispersal;\r\non the fertilisation of the flower, and on a score of other points,\r\nabout almost all of which we are profoundly ignorant. I am glad to read\r\nwhat you say about Bentham, for my inner consciousness tells me that\r\nhe has run too many forms together. Should you care to see an elaborate\r\nGerman pamphlet by Hermann Muller on the gradation and distinction of\r\nthe forms of Epipactis and of Platanthera? (696/3. \"Verhand. d. Nat.\r\nVer. f. Pr. Rh. u. Wesfal.\" Jahrg. XXV.: see \"Fertilisation of Orchids,\"\r\nEdition II., pages 74, 102.) It may be absurd in me to suggest, but I\r\nthink you would find curious facts and references in Lecoq's enormous\r\nbook (696/4. \"Geographie Botanique,\" 9 volumes, 1854-58.), in Vaucher's\r\nfour volumes (696/5. \"Plantes d'Europe,\" 4 volumes, 1841.), in\r\nHildebrand's \"Geschlechter Vertheilung\" (696/6 \"Geschlechter Vertheilung\r\nbei den Pflanzen,\" 1 volume, Leipzig, 1867.), and perhaps in Fournier's\r\n\"De la Fecondation.\" (696/7. \"De la Fecondation dans les Phanerogames,\"\r\npar Eugene Fournier: thesis published in Paris in 1863. The facts noted\r\nin Darwin's copy are the explosive stamens of Parietaria, the submerged\r\nflowers of Alisma containing air, the manner of fertilisation of\r\nLopezia, etc.) I wish you all success in your gigantic undertaking;\r\nbut what a pity you did not think of it ten years ago, so as to have\r\naccumulated references on all sorts of subjects. Depend upon it, you\r\nwill have started a new era in the floras of various countries. I can\r\nwell believe that Mrs. Hooker will be of the greatest possible use to\r\nyou in lightening your labours and arranging your materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 697. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 5th, 1868.\r\n\r\n...Now I want to beg for assistance for the new edition of \"Origin.\"\r\nNageli himself urges that plants offer many morphological differences,\r\nwhich from being of no service cannot have been selected, and which he\r\naccounts for by an innate principle of progressive development. (697/1.\r\nNageli's \"Enstehung und Begriff der Naturhistorischen Art.\" An address\r\ndelivered at the public session of the Royal Academy of Sciences of\r\nMunich, March 28th, 1865; published by the Academy. Darwin's copy is the\r\n2nd edition; it bears signs, in the pencilled notes on the margins, of\r\nhaving been read with interest. Much of it was translated for him by a\r\nGerman lady, whose version lies with the original among his pamphlets.\r\nAt page 27 Nageli writes: \"It is remarkable that the useful adaptations\r\nwhich Darwin brings forward in the case of animals, and which may be\r\ndiscovered in numbers among plants, are exclusively of a physiological\r\nkind, that they always show the formation or transformation of an\r\norgan to a special function. I do not know among plants a morphological\r\nmodification which can be explained on utilitarian principles.\" Opposite\r\nthis passage Darwin has written \"a very good objection\": but Nageli's\r\nsentence seems to us to be of the nature of a truism, for it is clear\r\nthat any structure whose evolution can be believed to have come about\r\nby Natural Selection must have a function, and the case falls into\r\nthe physiological category. The various meanings given to the term\r\nmorphological makes another difficulty. Nageli cannot use it in the\r\nsense of \"structural\"--in which sense it is often applied, since that\r\nwould mean that no plant structures have a utilitarian origin. The\r\nessence of morphology (in the better and more precise sense) is descent;\r\nthus we say that a pollen-grain is morphologically a microspore. And\r\nthis very example serves to show the falseness of Nageli's view, since\r\na pollen-grain is an adaptation to aerial as opposed to aquatic\r\nfertilisation. In the 5th edition of the \"Origin,\" 1869, page 151,\r\nDarwin discusses Nageli's essay, confining himself to the simpler\r\nstatement that there are many structural characters in plants to which\r\nwe cannot assign uses. See Volume I., Letter 207.) I find old notes\r\nabout this difficulty; but I have hitherto slurred it over. Nageli gives\r\nas instances the alternate and spiral arrangement of leaves, and the\r\narrangement of the cells in the tissues. Would you not consider as a\r\nmorphological difference the trimerous, tetramerous, etc., divisions\r\nof flowers, the ovules being erect or suspended, their attachment being\r\nparietal or placental, and even the shape of the seed when of no service\r\nto the plant.\r\n\r\nNow, I have thought, and want to show, that such differences follow in\r\nsome unexplained manner from the growth or development of plants which\r\nhave passed through a long series of adaptive changes. Anyhow, I want\r\nto show that these differences do not support the idea of progressive\r\ndevelopment. Cassini states that the ovaria on the circumference and\r\ncentre of Compos. flowers differ in essential characters, and so do\r\nthe seeds in sculpture. The seeds of Umbelliferae in the same relative\r\npositions are coelospermous and orthospermous. There is a case given by\r\nAugt. St. Hilaire of an erect and suspended ovule in the same ovarium,\r\nbut perhaps this hardly bears on the point. The summit flower, in Adoxa\r\nand rue differ from the lower flowers. What is the difference in flowers\r\nof the rue? how is the ovarium, especially in the rue? As Augt. St.\r\nHilaire insists on the locularity of the ovarium varying on the same\r\nplant in some of the Rutaceae, such differences do not speak, as it\r\nseems to me, in favour of progressive development. Will you turn\r\nthe subject in your mind, and tell me any more facts. Difference in\r\nstructure in flowers in different parts of the same plant seems best\r\nto show that they are the result of growth or position or amount of\r\nnutriment.\r\n\r\nI have got your photograph (697/2. A photograph by Mrs. Cameron.) over\r\nmy chimneypiece, and like it much; but you look down so sharp on me that\r\nI shall never be bold enough to wriggle myself out of any contradiction.\r\n\r\nOwen pitches into me and Lyell in grand style in the last chapter of\r\nvolume 3 of \"Anat. of Vertebrates.\" He is a cool hand. He puts words\r\nfrom me in inverted commas and alters them. (697/3. The passage referred\r\nto seems to be in Owen's \"Anatomy of Vertebrata,\" III., pages 798, 799,\r\nnote. \"I deeply regretted, therefore, to see in a 'Historical Sketch'\r\nof the Progress of Enquiry into the origin of species, prefixed to the\r\nfourth edition of that work (1866), that Mr. Darwin, after affirming\r\ninaccurately and without evidence, that I admitted Natural Selection to\r\nhave done something toward that end, to wit, the 'origin of species,'\r\nproceeds to remark: 'It is surprising that this admission should not\r\nhave been made earlier, as Prof. Owen now believes that he promulgated\r\nthe theory of Natural Selection in a passage read before the Zoological\r\nSociety in February, 1850, (\"Trans.\" Volume IV., page 15).'\" The first\r\nof the two passages quoted by Owen from the fourth edition of the\r\n\"Origin\" runs: \"Yet he [Prof. Owen] at the same time admits that Natural\r\nSelection MAY [our italics] have done something towards this end.\" In\r\nthe sixth edition of the \"Origin,\" page xviii., Darwin, after referring\r\nto a correspondence in the \"London Review\" between the Editor of that\r\nJournal and Owen, goes on: \"It appeared manifest to the editor, as well\r\nas to myself, that Prof. Owen claimed to have promulgated the theory of\r\nNatural Selection before I had done so;...but as far as it is possible\r\nto understand certain recently published passages (Ibid. [\"Anat. of\r\nVert.\"], Volume III., page 798), I have either partly or wholly again\r\nfallen into error. It is consolatory to me that others find Prof. Owen's\r\ncontroversial writings as difficult to understand and to reconcile with\r\neach other, as I do. As far as the mere enunciation of the principle\r\nof Natural Selection is concerned, it is quite immaterial whether or\r\nno Prof. Owen preceded me, for both of us, as shown in this historical\r\nsketch, were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells and Mr. Matthews.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 698. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 29th, 1868.\r\n\r\nYour letter is quite invaluable, for Nageli's essay (698/1. See\r\npreceding Letter.) is so clever that it will, and indeed I know it has\r\nproduced a great effect; so that I shall devote three or four pages\r\nto an answer. I have been particularly struck by your statements about\r\nerect and suspended ovules. You have given me heart, and I will fight my\r\nbattle better than I should otherwise have done. I think I cannot resist\r\nthrowing the contrivances in orchids into his teeth. You say nothing\r\nabout the flowers of the rue. (698/2. For Ruta see \"Origin,\" Edition\r\nV., page 154.) Ask your colleagues whether they know anything about the\r\nstructure of the flower and ovarium in the uppermost flower. But don't\r\nanswer on purpose.\r\n\r\nI have gone through my long Index of \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" which was\r\nmade solely for my own use, and am greatly disappointed to find, as I\r\nfear, hardly anything which will be of use to you. (698/3. For Hooker's\r\nprojected biological book, see Letter 696.) I send such as I have for\r\nthe chance of their being of use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 699. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 16th [1869].\r\n\r\nYour two notes and remarks are of the utmost value, and I am greatly\r\nobliged to you for your criticism on the term. \"Morphological\" seems\r\nquite just, but I do not see how I can avoid using it. I found, after\r\nwriting to you, in Vaucher about the Rue (699/1. \"Plantes d'Europe,\"\r\nVolume I., page 559, 1841.), but from what you say I will speak more\r\ncautiously. It is the Spanish Chesnut that varies in divergence. Seeds\r\nnamed Viola nana were sent me from Calcutta by Scott. I must refer\r\nto the plants as an \"Indian species,\" for though they have produced\r\nhundreds of closed flowers, they have not borne one perfect flower.\r\n(699/2. The cleistogamic flowers of Viola are used in the discussion on\r\nNageli's views. See \"Origin,\" Edition V., page 153.) You ask whether I\r\nwant illustrations \"of ovules differing in position in different flowers\r\non the same plant.\" If you know of such cases, I should certainly much\r\nlike to hear them. Again you speak of the angle of leaf-divergence\r\nvarying and the variations being transmitted. Was the latter point put\r\nin in a hurry to round the sentence, or do you really know of cases?\r\n\r\nWhilst looking for notes on the variability of the divisions of the\r\novarium, position of the ovules, aestivation, etc., I found remarks\r\nwritten fifteen or twenty years ago, showing that I then supposed that\r\ncharacters which were nearly uniform throughout whole groups must be\r\nof high vital importance to the plants themselves; consequently I was\r\ngreatly puzzled how, with organisms having very different habits\r\nof life, this uniformity could have been acquired through Natural\r\nSelection. Now, I am much inclined to believe, in accordance with\r\nthe view given towards the close of my MS., that the near approach\r\nto uniformity in such structures depends on their not being of vital\r\nimportance, and therefore not being acted on by Natural Selection.\r\n(699/3. This view is given in the \"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 372.) If\r\nyou have reflected on this point, what do you think of it? I hope that\r\nyou approved of the argument deduced from the modifications in the small\r\nclosed flowers.\r\n\r\nIt is only about two years since last edition of \"Origin,\" and I am\r\nfairly disgusted to find how much I have to modify, and how much I ought\r\nto add; but I have determined not to add much. Fleeming Jenkin has given\r\nme much trouble, but has been of more real use to me than any other\r\nessay or review. (699/4. On Fleeming Jenkin's review, \"N. British\r\nReview,\" June, 1867, see \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 107.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 700. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [January 22nd, 1869].\r\n\r\nYour letter is quite splenditious. I am greatly tempted, but shall,\r\nI hope, refrain from using some of your remarks in my chapter on\r\nClassification. It is very true what you say about unimportant\r\ncharacters being so important systematically; yet it is hardly\r\nparadoxical bearing in mind that the natural system is genetic, and that\r\nwe have to discover the genealogies anyhow. Hence such parts as organs\r\nof generation are so useful for classification though not concerned with\r\nthe manner of life. Hence use for same purpose of rudimentary organs,\r\netc. You cannot think what a relief it is that you do not object to this\r\nview, for it removes PARTLY a heavy burden from my shoulders. If I lived\r\ntwenty more years and was able to work, how I should have to modify the\r\n\"Origin,\" and how much the views on all points will have to be modified!\r\nWell, it is a beginning, and that is something...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 701. TO T.H. FARRER (Lord Farrer). Down, August 10th, 1869.\r\n\r\nYour view seems most ingenious and probable; but ascertain in a good\r\nmany cases that the nectar is actually within the staminal tube.\r\n(701/1. It seems that Darwin did not know that the staminal tube in\r\nthe diadelphous Leguminosae serves as a nectar-holder, and this is\r\nsurprising, as Sprengel was aware of the fact.) One can see that if\r\nthere is to be a split in the tube, the law of symmetry would lead it\r\nto be double, and so free one stamen. Your view, if confirmed, would be\r\nextremely well worth publication before the Linnean Society. It is to me\r\ndelightful to see what appears a mere morphological character found\r\nto be of use. It pleases me the more as Carl Nageli has lately been\r\npitching into me on this head. Hooker, with whom I discussed the\r\nsubject, maintained that uses would be found for lots more structures,\r\nand cheered me by throwing my own orchids into my teeth. (701/2. See\r\nLetters 697-700.)\r\n\r\nAll that you say about changed position of the peduncle in bud, in\r\nflower, and in seed, is quite new to me, and reminds me of analogous\r\ncases with tendrils. (701/3. See Vochting, \"Bewegung der Bluthen und\r\nFruchte,\" 1882; also Kerner, \"Pflanzenleben,\" Volume I., page 494,\r\nVolume II., page 121.) This is well worth working out, and I dare say\r\nthe brush of the stigma.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the hairs or filaments (about which I once spoke) within\r\ndifferent parts of flowers, I have a splendid Tacsonia with perfectly\r\npendent flowers, and there is only a microscopical vestige of the corona\r\nof coloured filaments; whilst in most common passion-flowers the flowers\r\nstand upright, and there is the splendid corona which apparently would\r\ncatch pollen. (701/4. Sprengel (\"Entdeckte Geheimniss,\" page 164)\r\nimagined that the crown of the Passion-flower served as a nectar-guide\r\nand as a platform for insects, while other rings of filaments served\r\nto keep rain from the nectar. F. Muller, quoted in H. Muller\r\n(\"Fertilisation,\" page 268), looks at the crowns of hairs, ridges in\r\nsome species, etc., as gratings serving to imprison flies which attract\r\nthe fertilising humming-birds. There is, we believe, no evidence that\r\nthe corona catches pollen. See Letter 704, note.)\r\n\r\nOn the lower side of corolla of foxglove there are some fine hairs, but\r\nthese seem of not the least use (701/5. It has been suggested that the\r\nhairs serve as a ladder for humble bees; also that they serve to keep\r\nout \"unbidden guests.\")--a mere purposeless exaggeration of down on\r\noutside--as I conclude after watching the bees at work, and afterwards\r\ncovering up some plants; for the protected flowers rarely set any seed,\r\nso that the hairy lower part of corolla does not come into contact with\r\nstigma, as some Frenchman says occurs with some other plants, as Viola\r\nodorata and I think Iris.\r\n\r\nI heartily wish I could accept your kind invitation, for I am not by\r\nnature a savage, but it is impossible. Forgive my dreadful handwriting,\r\nnone of my womenkind are about to act as amanuensis.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 702. TO WILLIAM C. TAIT.\r\n\r\n(702/1. Mr. Tait, to whom the following letter is addressed, was\r\nresident in Portugal. His kindness in sending plants of Drosophyllum\r\nlusitanicum is acknowledged in \"Insectivorous Plants.\")\r\n\r\nDown, March 12th, 1869.\r\n\r\nI have received your two letters of March 2nd and 5th, and I really do\r\nnot know how to thank you enough for your extraordinary kindness and\r\nenergy. I am glad to hear that the inhabitants notice the power of the\r\nDrosophyllum to catch flies, for this is the subject of my studies.\r\n(702/2. The natives are said to hang up plants of Drosophyllum in their\r\ncottages to act as fly-papers (\"Insectivorous Plants,\" page 332).) I\r\nhave observed during several years the manner in which this is effected,\r\nand the results produced in several species of Drosera, and in the\r\nwonderful American Dionoea, the leaves of which catch insects just like\r\na steel rat-trap. Hence I was most anxious to learn how the Drosophyllum\r\nwould act, so that the Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew wrote some\r\nyears ago to Portugal to obtain specimens for me, but quite failed.\r\nSo you see what a favour you have conferred on me. With Drosera it is\r\nnothing less than marvellous how minute a fraction of a grain of any\r\nnitrogenised matter the plant can detect; and how differently it behaves\r\nwhen matter, not containing nitrogen, of the same consistence, whether\r\nfluid or solid, is applied to the glands. It is also exquisitely\r\nsensitive to a weight of even the 1/70000 of a grain. From what I can\r\nsee of the glands on Drosophyllum I suspect that I shall find only\r\nthe commencement, or nascent state of the wonderful capacities of the\r\nDrosera, and this will be eminently interesting to me. My MS. on this\r\nsubject has been nearly ready for publication during some years, but\r\nwhen I shall have strength and time to publish I know not.\r\n\r\nAnd now to turn to other points in your letter. I am quite ignorant of\r\nferns, and cannot name your specimen. The variability of ferns passes\r\nall bounds. With respect to your Laugher Pigeons, if the same with\r\nthe two sub-breeds which I kept, I feel sure from the structure of\r\nthe skeleton, etc., that it is a descendant of C. livia. In regard\r\nto beauty, I do not feel the difficulty which you and some others\r\nexperience. In the last edition of my \"Origin\" I have discussed the\r\nquestion, but necessarily very briefly. (702/3. Fourth Edition, page\r\n238.) A new and I hope amended edition of the \"Origin\" is now passing\r\nthrough the press, and will be published in a month or two, and it will\r\ngive me great pleasure to send you a copy. Is there any place in London\r\nwhere parcels are received for you, or shall I send it by post? With\r\nreference to dogs' tails, no doubt you are aware that a rudimentary\r\nstump is regularly inherited by certain breeds of sheep-dogs, and by\r\nManx cats. You speak of a change in the position of the axis of the\r\nearth: this is a subject quite beyond me, but I believe the astronomers\r\nreject the idea. Nevertheless, I have long suspected that some\r\nperiodical astronomical or cosmical cause must be the agent of the\r\nincessant oscillations of level in the earth's crust. About a month\r\nago I suggested this to a man well capable of judging, but he could not\r\nconceive any such agency; he promised, however, to keep it in mind. I\r\nwish I had time and strength to write to you more fully. I had intended\r\nto send this letter off at once, but on reflection will keep it till I\r\nreceive the plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 703. TO H. MULLER. Down, March 14th, 1870.\r\n\r\nI think you have set yourself a new, very interesting, and difficult\r\nline of research. As far as I know, no one has carefully observed the\r\nstructure of insects in relation to flowers, although so many have\r\nnow attended to the converse relation. (703/1. See Letter 462, also H.\r\nMuller, \"Fertilisation of Flowers,\" English Translation, page 30, on\r\n\"The insects which visit flowers.\" In Muller's book references are\r\ngiven to several of his papers on this subject.) As I imagine few or\r\nno insects are adapted to suck the nectar or gather the pollen of\r\nany single family of plants, such striking adaptations can hardly, I\r\npresume, be expected in insects as in flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 704. TO T.H. FARRER (Lord Farrer).\r\n\r\nDown, May 28th, 1870.\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have known that the stamens recovered their former\r\nposition in Berberis (704/1. See Farrer, \"Nature,\" II., 1870, page 164.\r\nLord Farrer was before H. Muller in making out the mechanism of the\r\nbarberry.), for I formerly tried experiments with anaesthetics, but I\r\nhad forgotten the facts, and I quite agree with you that it is a\r\nsound argument that the movement is not for self-fertilisation. The\r\nN. American barberries (Mahonia) offer a good proof to what an extent\r\nnatural crossing goes on in this genus; for it is now almost impossible\r\nin this country to procure a true specimen of the two or three forms\r\noriginally introduced.\r\n\r\nI hope the seeds of Passiflora will germinate, for the turning up of the\r\npendent flower must be full of meaning. (704/2. Darwin had (May 12th,\r\n1870) sent to Farrer an extract from a letter from F. Muller, containing\r\na description of a Passiflora visited by humming-birds, in which the\r\nlong flower-stalk curls up so that \"the flower itself is upright.\"\r\nAnother species visited by bees is described as having \"dependent\r\nflowers.\" In a letter, June 29th, 1870, Mr. Farrer had suggested that P.\r\nprinceps, which he described as having sub-erect flowers, is fitted for\r\nhumming-birds' visits. In another letter, October 13th, 1869, he\r\nsays that Tacsonia, which has pendent flowers and no corona, is not\r\nfertilised by insects in English glass-houses, and may be adapted for\r\nhumming-birds. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 279, for Farrer's\r\nremarks on Tacsonia and Passiflora; also H. Muller's \"Fertilisation of\r\nFlowers,\" page 268, for what little is known on the subject; also Letter\r\n701 in the present volume.) I am so glad that you are able to occupy\r\nyourself a little with flowers: I am sure it is most wise in you, for\r\nyour own sake and children's sakes.\r\n\r\nSome little time ago Delpino wrote to me praising the Swedish book on\r\nthe fertilisation of plants; as my son George can read a little Swedish,\r\nI should like to have it back for a time, just to hear a little what it\r\nis about, if you would be so kind as to return it by book-post.\r\n(704/3. Severin Axell, \"Om anordningarna for de Fanerogama Vaxternas\r\nBefruktning,\" Stockholm, 1869.)\r\n\r\nI am going steadily on with my experiments on the comparative growth\r\nof crossed and self-fertilised plants, and am now coming to some very\r\ncurious anomalies and some interesting results. I forget whether I\r\nshowed you any of them when you were here for a few hours. You ought\r\nto see them, as they explain at a glance why Nature has taken such\r\nextraordinary pains to ensure frequent crosses between distinct\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nIf in the course of the summer you should feel any inclination to come\r\nhere for a day or two, I hope that you will propose to do so, for we\r\nshould be delighted to see you...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 705. TO ASA GRAY. Down, December 7th, 1870.\r\n\r\nI have been very glad to receive your letter this morning. I have for\r\nsome time been wishing to write to you, but have been half worked to\r\ndeath in correcting my uncouth English for my new book. (705/1.\r\n\"Descent of Man.\") I have been glad to hear of your cases appearing like\r\nincipient dimorphism. I believe that they are due to mere variability,\r\nand have no significance. I found a good instance in Nolana prostrata,\r\nand experimented on it, but the forms did not differ in fertility. So it\r\nwas with Amsinckia, of which you told me. I have long thought that such\r\nvariations afforded the basis for the development of dimorphism. I was\r\nnot aware of such cases in Phlox, but have often admired the arrangement\r\nof the anthers, causing them to be all raked by an inserted proboscis. I\r\nam glad also to hear of your curious case of variability in ovules, etc.\r\n\r\nI said that I had been wishing to write to you, and this was about your\r\nDrosera, which after many fluctuations between life and death, at last\r\nmade a shoot which I could observe. The case is rather interesting; but\r\nI must first remind you that the filament of Dionoea is not sensitive\r\nto very light prolonged pressure, or to nitrogenous matter, but is\r\nexquisitely sensitive to the slightest touch. (705/2. In another\r\nconnection the following reference to Dionoea is of some interest: \"I am\r\nsure I never heard of Curtis's observations on Dionoea, nor have I met\r\nwith anything more than general statements about this plant or about\r\nNepenthes catching insects.\" (From a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker, July\r\n12th, 1860.)) In our Drosera the filaments are not sensitive to a slight\r\ntouch, but are sensitive to prolonged pressure from the smallest object\r\nof any nature; they are also sensitive to solid or fluid nitrogenous\r\nmatter. Now in your Drosera the filaments are not sensitive to a rough\r\ntouch or to any pressure from non-nitrogenous matter, but are sensitive\r\nto solid or fluid nitrogenous matter. (705/3. Drosera filiformis: see\r\n\"Insectivorous Plants,\" page 281. The above account does not entirely\r\nagree with Darwin's published statement. The filaments moved when bits\r\nof cork or cinder were placed on them; they did not, however, respond\r\nto repeated touches with a needle, thus behaving differently from D.\r\nrotundifolia. It should be remembered that the last-named species is\r\nsomewhat variable in reacting to repeated touches.) Is it not curious\r\nthat there should be such diversified sensitiveness in allied plants?\r\n\r\nI received a very obliging letter from Mr. Morgan, but did not see him,\r\nas I think he said he was going to start at once for the Continent. I am\r\nsorry to hear rather a poor account of Mrs. Gray, to whom my wife and I\r\nboth beg to be very kindly remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 706. TO C.V. RILEY.\r\n\r\n(706/1. In Riley's opinion his most important work was the series\r\nentitled \"Annual Report on the Noxious, Beneficial, and other Insects\r\nof the State of Missouri\" (Jefferson City), beginning in 1869. These\r\nreports were greatly admired by Mr. Darwin, and his copies of them,\r\nespecially of Nos. 3 and 4, show signs of careful reading.)\r\n\r\nDown, June 1st [1871].\r\n\r\nI received some little time ago your report on noxious insects, and have\r\nnow read the whole with the greatest interest. (706/2. \"Third Annual\r\nReport on the Noxious, Beneficial, and other Insects of the State of\r\nMissouri\" (Jefferson City, Mo.). The mimetic case occurs at page 67; the\r\n1875 pupae of Pterophorus periscelidactylus, the \"Grapevine Plume,\" have\r\npupae either green or reddish brown, the former variety being found on\r\nthe leaves, the latter on the brown stems of the vine.) There are a vast\r\nnumber of facts and generalisations of value to me, and I am struck with\r\nadmiration at your powers of observation.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on mimetic insects seems to me particularly good and\r\noriginal. Pray accept my cordial thanks for the instruction and interest\r\nwhich I have received.\r\n\r\nWhat a loss to Natural Science our poor mutual friend Walsh has been; it\r\nis a loss ever to be deplored...\r\n\r\nYour country is far ahead of ours in some respects; our Parliament would\r\nthink any man mad who should propose to appoint a State Entomologist.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 707A. TO C.V. RILEY.\r\n\r\n(706A/1. We have found it convenient to place the two letters to Riley\r\ntogether, rather than separate them chronologically.)\r\n\r\nDown, September 28th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI must write half a dozen lines to say how much interested I have been\r\nby your \"Further Notes\" on Pronuba which you were so kind as to send me.\r\n(706A/2. \"Proc. Amer. Assoc. Adv. Sci.\" 1880.) I had read the various\r\ncriticisms, and though I did not know what answer could be made, yet I\r\nfelt full confidence in your result, and now I see that I was right...If\r\nyou make any further observation on Pronuba it would, I think, be well\r\nworth while for you to observe whether the moth can or does occasionally\r\nbring pollen from one plant to the stigma of a distinct one (706A/3.\r\nRiley discovered the remarkable fact that the Yucca moth (Pronuba\r\nyuccasella) lays its eggs in the ovary of Yucca flowers, which it has\r\npreviously pollinated, thus making sure of a supply of ovules for the\r\nlarvae.), for I have shown that the cross-fertilisation of the flowers\r\non the same plant does very little good; and, if I am not mistaken,\r\nyou believe that Pronuba gathers pollen from the same flower which she\r\nfertilises.\r\n\r\nWhat interesting and beautiful observations you have made on the\r\nmetamorphoses of the grasshopper-destroying insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 707. TO F. HILDEBRAND. Down, February 9th [1872].\r\n\r\nOwing to other occupations I was able to read only yesterday your\r\npaper on the dispersal of the seeds of Compositae. (707/1. \"Ueber die\r\nVerbreitungsmittel der Compositenfruchte.\" \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1872, page\r\n1.) Some of the facts which you mention are extremely interesting.\r\n\r\nI write now to suggest as worthy of your examination the curious\r\nadhesive filaments of mucus emitted by the achenia of many Compositae,\r\nof which no doubt you are aware. My attention was first called to the\r\nsubject by the achenia of an Australian Pumilio (P. argyrolepis), which\r\nI briefly described in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" 1861, page 5. As the\r\nthreads of mucus dry and contract they draw the seeds up into a vertical\r\nposition on the ground. It subsequently occurred to me that if these\r\nseeds were to fall on the wet hairs of any quadruped they would adhere\r\nfirmly, and might be carried to any distance. I was informed that\r\nDecaisne has written a paper on these adhesive threads. What is the\r\nmeaning of the mucus so copiously emitted from the moistened seeds of\r\nIberis, and of at least some species of Linum? Does the mucus serve as\r\na protection against their being devoured, or as a means of attachment.\r\n(707/2. Various theories have been suggested, e.g., that the slime by\r\nanchoring the seed to the soil facilitates the entrance of the radicle\r\ninto the soil: the slime has also been supposed to act as a temporary\r\nwater-store. See Klebs in Pfeffer's \"Untersuchungen aus dem Bot. Inst.\r\nzu Tubingen,\" I., page 581.) I have been prevented reading your paper\r\nsooner by attempting to read Dr. Askenasy's pamphlet, but the German is\r\ntoo difficult for me to make it all out. (707/3. E. Askenasy, \"Beitrage\r\nzur Kritik der Darwin'schen Lehre.\" Leipzig, 1872.) He seems to follow\r\nNageli completely. I cannot but think that both much underrate the\r\nutility of various parts of plants; and that they greatly underrate\r\nthe unknown laws of correlated growth, which leads to all sorts of\r\nmodifications, when some one structure or the whole plant is modified\r\nfor some particular object.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 708. TO T.H. FARRER. (Lord Farrer).\r\n\r\n(708/1. The following letter refers to a series of excellent\r\nobservations on the fertilisation of Leguminosae, made by Lord Farrer in\r\nthe autumn of 1869, in ignorance of Delpino's work on the subject. The\r\nresult was published in \"Nature,\" October 10th and 17th, 1872, and\r\nis full of interesting suggestions. The discovery of the mechanism in\r\nCoronilla mentioned in a note was one of the cases in which Lord Farrer\r\nwas forestalled.)\r\n\r\nDown [1872].\r\n\r\nI declare I am almost as sorry as if I had been myself\r\nforestalled--indeed, more so, for I am used to it. It is, however, a\r\nparamount, though bothersome duty in every naturalist to try and make\r\nout all that has been done by others on the subject. By all means\r\npublish next summer your confirmation and a summary of Delpino's\r\nobservations, with any new ones of your own. Especially attend about the\r\nnectary exterior to the staminal tube. (708/2. This refers to a species\r\nof Coronilla in which Lord Farrer made the remarkable discovery that the\r\nnectar is secreted on the outside of the calyx. See \"Nature,\" July 2nd,\r\n1874, page 169; also Letter 715.) This will in every way be far better\r\nthan writing to Delpino. It would not be at all presumptuous in you to\r\ncriticise Delpino. I am glad you think him so clever; for so it struck\r\nme.\r\n\r\nLook at hind legs yourself of some humble and hive-bees; in former take\r\na very big individual (if any can be found) for these are the females,\r\nthe males being smaller, and they have no pollen-collecting apparatus.\r\nI do not remember where it is figured--probably in Kirby & Spence--but\r\nactual inspection better...\r\n\r\nPlease do not return any of my books until all are finished, and do not\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nI feel certain you will make fine discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 709. TO T.H. FARRER. (Lord Farrer). Sevenoaks, October 13th,\r\n1872.\r\n\r\nI must send you a line to say how extremely good your article appears to\r\nme to be. It is even better than I thought, and I remember thinking it\r\nvery good. I am particularly glad of the excellent summary of evidence\r\nabout the common pea, as it will do for me hereafter to quote; nocturnal\r\ninsects will not do. I suspect that the aboriginal parent had bluish\r\nflowers. I have seen several times bees visiting common and sweet\r\npeas, and yet varieties, purposely grown close together, hardly ever\r\nintercross. This is a point which for years has half driven me mad,\r\nand I have discussed it in my \"Var. of Animals and Plants under Dom.\"\r\n(709/1. In the second edition (1875) of the \"Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants,\" Volume I., page 348, Darwin added, with respect to the rarity\r\nof spontaneous crosses in Pisum: \"I have reason to believe that this\r\nis due to their stignas being prematurely fertilised in this country\r\nby pollen from the same flower.\" This explanation is, we think, almost\r\ncertainly applicable to Lathyrus odoratus, though in Darwin's latest\r\npublication on the subject he gives reasons to the contrary. See \"Cross\r\nand Self-Fertilisation,\" page 156, where the problem is left unsolved.\r\nCompare Letter 714 to Delpino. In \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 261,\r\nthe absence of cross-fertilisation is explained as due to want of\r\nperfect adaptation between the pea and our native insects. This is\r\nHermann Muller's view: see his \"Fertilisation of Flowers,\" page 214.\r\nSee Letter 583, note.) I now suspect (and I wish I had strength to\r\nexperimentise next spring) that from changed climate both species\r\nare prematurely fertilised, and therefore hardly ever cross. When\r\nartificially crossed by removal of own pollen in bud, the offspring are\r\nvery vigorous.\r\n\r\nFarewell.--I wish I could compel you to go on working at fertilisation\r\ninstead of so insignificant a subject as the commerce of the country!\r\n\r\nYou pay me a very pretty compliment at the beginning of your paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 710. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(710/1. The following letters to Sir J.D. Hooker and the late Mr.\r\nMoggridge refer to Moggridge's observation that seeds stored in the nest\r\nof the ant Atta at Mentone do not germinate, though they are certainly\r\nnot dead. Moggridge's observations are given in his book, \"Harvesting\r\nAnts and Trap-Door Spiders,\" 1873, which is full of interesting details.\r\nThe book is moreover remarkable in having resuscitated our knowledge of\r\nthe existence of the seed-storing habit. Mr. Moggridge points out that\r\nthe ancients were familiar with the facts, and quotes the well-known\r\nfable of the ant and the grasshopper, which La Fontaine borrowed from\r\nAesop. Mr. Moggridge (page 5) goes on: \"So long as Europe was taught\r\nNatural History by southern writers the belief prevailed; but no sooner\r\ndid the tide begin to turn, and the current of information to flood from\r\nnorth to south, than the story became discredited.\"\r\n\r\nIn Moggridge's \"supplement\" on the same subject, published in 1874, the\r\nauthor gives an account of his experiments made at Darwin's suggestion,\r\nand concludes (page 174) that \"the vapour of formic acid is incapable\r\nof rendering the seeds dormant after the manner of the ants,\" and\r\nthat indeed \"its influence is always injurious to the seeds, even when\r\npresent only in excessively minute quantities.\" Though unable to explain\r\nthe method employed, he was convinced \"that the non-germination of the\r\nseeds is due to some direct influence voluntarily exercised by the ants,\r\nand not merely to the conditions found in the nest\" (page 172). See\r\nVolume I., Letter 251.)\r\n\r\nDown, February 21st [1873].\r\n\r\nYou have given me exactly the information which I wanted.\r\n\r\nGeniuses jump. I have just procured formic acid to try whether its\r\nvapour or minute drops will delay germination of fresh seeds; trying\r\nothers at same time for comparison. But I shall not be able to try them\r\ntill middle of April, as my despotic wife insists on taking a house in\r\nLondon for a month from the middle of March.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear of the Primer (710/2. \"Botany\" (Macmillan's Science\r\nPrimers).); it is not at all, I think, a folly. Do you know Asa Gray's\r\nchild book on the functions of plants, or some such title? It is very\r\ngood in giving an interest to the subject.\r\n\r\nBy the way, can you lend me the January number of the \"London Journal of\r\nBotany\" for an article on insect-agency in fertilisation?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 711. TO J. TRAHERNE MOGGRIDGE. Down, August 27th, 1873.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very interesting letter, and I honour you for your\r\nlaborious and careful experiments. No one knows till he tries how many\r\nunexpected obstacles arise in subjecting plants to experiments.\r\n\r\nI can think of no suggestions to make; but I may just mention that I\r\nhad intended to try the effects of touching the dampened seeds with the\r\nminutest drop of formic acid at the end of a sharp glass rod, so as to\r\nimitate the possible action of the sting of the ant. I heartily hope\r\nthat you may be rewarded by coming to some definite result; but I fail\r\nfive times out of six in my own experiments. I have lately been trying\r\nsome with poor success, and suppose that I have done too much, for I\r\nhave been completely knocked up for some days.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 712. TO J. TRAHERNE MOGGRIDGE. Down, March 10th, 1874.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear that the vapour experiments have failed; but\r\nnothing could be better, as it seems to me, than your plan of enclosing\r\na number of the ants with the seeds. The incidental results on the power\r\nof different vapours in killing seeds and stopping germination appear\r\nvery curious, and as far as I know are quite new.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I never before heard of seeds not germinating except during a\r\ncertain season; it will be a very strange fact if you can prove this.\r\n(712/1. Certain seeds pass through a resting period before germination.\r\nSee Pfeffer's \"Pflanzenphysiologie,\" Edition I., Volume II., page III.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 713. TO H. MULLER. Down, May 30th, 1873.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your letter received this morning. I write now\r\nchiefly to give myself the pleasure of telling you how cordially I\r\nadmire the last part of your book, which I have finished. (713/1.\r\n\"Die Befruchtung der Blumen durch Insekten\": Leipzig, 1873. An English\r\ntranslation was published in 1883 by Prof. D'Arcy Thompson. The\r\n\"Prefatory Notice\" to this work (February 6th, 1882) is almost the last\r\nof Mr. Darwin's writings. See \"Life and Letters,\" page 281.) The whole\r\ndiscussion seems to me quite excellent, and it has pleased me not a\r\nlittle to find that in the rough MS. of my last chapter I have arrived\r\non many points at nearly the same conclusions that you have done, though\r\nwe have reached them by different routes. (713/2. \"The Effects of Cross\r\nand Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom\": London, 1876.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 714. TO F. DELPINO. Down, June 25th [1873].\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your letter. I am very glad to hear about\r\nLathyrus odoratus, for here in England the vars. never cross, and\r\nyet are sometimes visited by bees. (714/1. In \"Cross and\r\nSelf-Fertilisation,\" page 156, Darwin quotes the information received\r\nfrom Delpino and referred to in the present letter--namely, that it\r\nis the fixed opinion of the Italian gardeners that the varieties do\r\nintercross. See Letter 709.) Pisum sativum I have also many times seen\r\nvisited by Bombus. I believe the cause of the many vars. not crossing\r\nis that under our climate the flowers are self-fertilised at an early\r\nperiod, before the corolla is fully expanded. I shall examine this point\r\nwith L. odoratus. I have read H. Muller's book, and it seems to me very\r\ngood. Your criticism had not occurred to me, but is, I think just--viz.\r\nthat it is much more important to know what insects habitually visit any\r\nflower than the various kinds which occasionally visit it. Have you seen\r\nA. Kerner's book \"Schutzmittel des Pollens,\" 1873, Innsbruck. (714/2.\r\nAfterwards translated by Dr. Ogle as \"Flowers and their Unbidden\r\nGuests,\" with a prefatory letter by Charles Darwin, 1878.) It is very\r\ninteresting, but he does not seem to know anything about the work of\r\nother authors.\r\n\r\nI have Bentham's paper in my house, but have not yet had time to read a\r\nword of it. He is a man with very sound judgment, and fully admits the\r\nprinciple of evolution.\r\n\r\nI have lately had occasion to look over again your discussion on\r\nanemophilous plants, and I have again felt much admiration at your work.\r\n(714/3. \"Atti della Soc. Italiana di Scienze Nat.\" Volume XIII.)\r\n\r\n(714/4. In the beginning of August, 1873, Darwin paid the first of\r\nseveral visits to Lord Farrer's house at Abinger. When sending copies of\r\nDarwin's letters for the \"Life and Letters,\" Lord Farrer was good enough\r\nto add explanatory notes and recollections, from which we quote the\r\nfollowing sketch.)\r\n\r\n\"Above my house are some low hills, standing up in the valley, below the\r\nchalk range on the one hand and the more distant range of Leith Hill\r\non the other, with pretty views of the valley towards Dorking in one\r\ndirection and Guildford in the other. They are composed of the less\r\nfertile Greensand strata, and are covered with fern, broom, gorse, and\r\nheath. Here it was a particular pleasure of his to wander, and his\r\ntall figure, with his broad-brimmed Panama hat and long stick like an\r\nalpenstock, sauntering solitary and slow over our favourite walks, is\r\none of the pleasantest of the many pleasant associations I have with the\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 715. TO T.H. FARRER (Lord Farrer).\r\n\r\n(715/1. The following note by Lord Farrer explains the main point of\r\nthe letter, which, however, refers to the \"bloom\" problem as well as to\r\nCoronilla:--\r\n\r\n\"I thought I had found out what puzzled us in Coronilla varia: in most\r\nof the Papilionaceae, when the tenth stamen is free, there is nectar in\r\nthe staminal tube, and the opening caused by the free stamen enables the\r\nbee to reach the nectar, and in so doing the bee fertilises the plant.\r\nIn Coronilla varia, and in several other species of Coronilla, there is\r\nno nectar in the staminal tube or in the tube of the corolla. But\r\nthere are peculiar glands with nectar on the outside of the calyx, and\r\npeculiar openings in the tube of the corolla through which the proboscis\r\nof the bee, whilst entering the flower in the usual way and dusting\r\nitself with pollen, can reach these glands, thus fertilising the plant\r\nin getting the nectar. On writing this to Mr. Darwin, I received the\r\nfollowing characteristic note.\r\n\r\nThe first postscript relates to the rough ground behind my house, over\r\nwhich he was fond of strolling. It had been ploughed up and then allowed\r\nto go back, and the interest was to watch how the numerous species of\r\nweeds of cultivation which followed the plough gradually gave way in the\r\nstruggle for existence to the well-known and much less varied flora of\r\nan English common.\")\r\n\r\nBassett, Southampton, August 14th, 1873.\r\n\r\nYou are the man to conquer a Coronilla. (715/2. In a former letter to\r\nLord Farrer, Darwin wrote: \"Here is a maxim for you, 'It is disgraceful\r\nto be beaten by a Coronilla.'\") I have been looking at the half-dried\r\nflowers, and am prepared to swear that you have solved the mystery.\r\nThe difference in the size of the cells on the calyx under the vexillum\r\nright down to the common peduncle is conspicuous. The flour still\r\nadhered to this side; I see little bracteae or stipules apparently with\r\nglandular ends at the base of the calyces. Do these secrete? It seems\r\nto me a beautiful case. When I saw the odd shape of the base of the\r\nvexillum, I concluded that it must have some meaning, but little dreamt\r\nwhat that was. Now there remains only the one serious point--viz.the\r\nseparation of the one stamen. I daresay that you are right in that\r\nnectar was originally secreted within the staminal tube; but why has not\r\nthe one stamen long since cohered? The great difference in structure\r\nfor fertilisation within the same genus makes one believe that all such\r\npoints are vary variable. (715/3. Coronilla emerus is of the ordinary\r\npapilionaceous type.) With respect to the non-coherence of the one\r\nstamen, do examine some flower-buds at a very early age; for parts which\r\nare largely developed are often developed to an unusual degree at a\r\nvery early age, and it seems to me quite possible that the base of the\r\nvexillum (to which the single stamen adhered) might thus be developed,\r\nand thus keep it separate for a time from the other stamens. The\r\ncohering stamens to the right and left of the single one seem to me\r\nto be pushed out a little laterally. When you have finished your\r\nobservations, you really ought to send an account with a diagram to\r\n\"Nature,\" recalling your generalisation about the diadelphous structure,\r\nand now explaining the exception of Coronilla. (715/4. The observations\r\nwere published in \"Nature,\" Volume X., 1874, page 169.)\r\n\r\nDo add a remark how almost every detail of structure has a meaning where\r\na flower is well examined.\r\n\r\nYour observations pleased me so much that I could not sit still for half\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nPlease to thank Mr. Payne (715/5. Lord Farrer's gardener.) for his\r\nremarks, which are of value to me, with reference to Mimosa. I am\r\nvery much in doubt whether opening the sashes can act by favouring the\r\nevaporation of the drops; may not the movement of the leaves shake off\r\nthe drops, or change their places? If Mr. Payne remembers any plant\r\nwhich is easily injured by drops, I wish he would put a drop or two on\r\na leaf on a bright day, and cover the plant with a clean bell-glass,\r\nand do the same for another plant, but without a bell-glass over it, and\r\nobserve the effects.\r\n\r\nThank you much for wishing to see us again at Abinger, and it is very\r\ndoubtful whether it will be Coronilla, Mr. Payne, the new garden, the\r\nchildren, E. [Lady Farrer], or yourself which will give me the most\r\npleasure to see again.\r\n\r\nP.S. 1.--It will be curious to note in how many years the rough ground\r\nbecomes quite uniform in its flora.\r\n\r\nP.S. 2.--One may feel sure that periodically nectar was secreted within\r\nthe flower and then secreted by the calyx, as in some species of Iris\r\nand orchids. This latter being taken advantage of in Coronilla would\r\nallow of the secretion within the flower ceasing, and as this change was\r\ngoing on in the two secretions, all the parts of the flower would become\r\nmodified and correlated.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 716. TO J. BURDON SANDERSON. Down, Tuesday, September 9th [1873].\r\n\r\n(716/1. Sir J. Burdon Sanderson showed that in Dionoea movement\r\nis accompanied by electric disturbances closely analogous to those\r\noccurring in muscle (see \"Nature,\" 1874, pages 105, 127; \"Proc. R. Soc.\"\r\nXXI., and \"Phil. Trans.\" Volume CLXXIII., 1883, where the results are\r\nfinally discussed).)\r\n\r\nI will send up early to-morrow two plants [of Dionoea] with five goodish\r\nleaves, which you will know by their being tied to sticks. Please\r\nremember that the slightest touch, even by a hair, of the three\r\nfilaments on each lobe makes the leaf close, and it will not open for\r\ntwenty-four hours. You had better put 1/4 in. of water into the saucers\r\nof the pots. The plants have been kept too cool in order to retard\r\nthem. You had better keep them rather warm (i.e. temperature of warm\r\ngreenhouse) for a day, and in a good light.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad you have undertaken this subject. If you get a\r\npositive result, I should think you ought to publish it separately, and\r\nI could quote it; or I should be most glad to introduce any note by you\r\ninto my account.\r\n\r\nI have no idea whether it is troublesome to try with the thermo-electric\r\npile any change of temperature when the leaf closes. I could detect none\r\nwith a common thermometer. But if there is any change of temperature I\r\nshould expect it would occur some eight to twelve or twenty-four\r\nhours after the leaf has been given a big smashed fly, and when it is\r\ncopiously secreting its acid digestive fluid.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that, as far as I can make out, the inferior surface of\r\nthe leaf is always in a state of tension, and that the contraction is\r\nconfined to the upper surface; so that when this contraction ceases or\r\nsuddenly fails (as by immersion in boiling water) the leaf opens again,\r\nor more widely than is natural to it.\r\n\r\nWhenever you have quite finished, I will send for the plants in their\r\nbasket. My son Frank is staying at 6, Queen Anne Street, and comes home\r\non Saturday afternoon, but you will not have finished by that time.\r\n\r\nP.S. I have repeated my experiment on digestion in Drosera with complete\r\nsuccess. By giving leaves a very little weak hydrochloric acid, I can\r\nmake them digest albumen--i.e. white of egg--quicker than they can do\r\nnaturally. I most heartily thank you for all your kindness. I have been\r\npretty bad lately, and must work very little.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 717. TO J. BURDON SANDERSON. September 13th [1873].\r\n\r\nHow very kind it was of you to telegraph to me. I am quite delighted\r\nthat you have got a decided result. Is it not a very remarkable fact? It\r\nseems so to me, in my ignorance. I wish I could remember more distinctly\r\nwhat I formerly read of Du Bois Raymond's results. My poor memory never\r\nserves me for more than a vague guide. I really think you ought to try\r\nDrosera. In a weak solution of phosphate of ammonia (viz. 1 gr. to 20\r\noz. of water) it will contract in about five minutes, and even more\r\nquickly in pure warm water; but then water, I suppose, would prevent\r\nyour trial. I forget, but I think it contracts pretty quickly (i.e. in\r\nan hour or two) with a large drop of a rather stronger solution of the\r\nphosphate, or with an atom of raw meat on the disc of the leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 718. TO J.D. HOOKER. October 31st, 1873.\r\n\r\nNow I want to tell you, for my own pleasure, about the movements of\r\nDesmodium.\r\n\r\n1. When the plant goes to sleep, the terminal leaflets hang vertically\r\ndown, but the petioles move up towards the axis, so that the dependent\r\nleaves are all crowded round it. The little leaflets never go to sleep,\r\nand this seems to me very odd; they are at their games of play as late\r\nas 11 o'clock at night and probably later. (718/1. Stahl (\"Botanische\r\nZeitung,\" 1897, page 97) has suggested that the movements of the dwarf\r\nleaflets in Desmodium serve to shake the large terminal leaflets, and\r\nthus increase transpiration. According to Stahl's view their movement\r\nwould be more useful at night than by day, because stagnation of the\r\ntranspiration-current is more likely to occur at night.)\r\n\r\n2. If the plant is shaken or syringed with tepid water, the terminal\r\nleaflets move down through about an angle of 45 deg, and the petioles\r\nlikewise move about 11 deg downwards; so that they move in an opposite\r\ndirection to what they do when they go to sleep. Cold water or air\r\nproduces the same effect as does shaking. The little leaflets are not\r\nin the least affected by the plant being shaken or syringed. I have no\r\ndoubt, from various facts, that the downward movement of the terminal\r\nleaflets and petioles from shaking and syringing is to save them from\r\ninjury from warm rain.\r\n\r\n3. The axis, the main petiole, and the terminal leaflets are all,\r\nwhen the temperature is high, in constant movement, just like that of\r\nclimbing plants. This movement seems to be of no service, any more than\r\nthe incessant movement of amoeboid bodies. The movement of the terminal\r\nleaflets, though insensible to the eye, is exactly the same as that of\r\nthe little lateral leaflets--viz. from side to side, up and down,\r\nand half round their own axes. The only difference is that the little\r\nleaflets move to a much greater extent, and perhaps more rapidly; and\r\nthey are excited into movement by warm water, which is not the case with\r\nthe terminal leaflet. Why the little leaflets, which are rudimentary in\r\nsize and have lost their sleep-movements and their movements from\r\nbeing shaken, should not only have retained, but have their spontaneous\r\nmovements exaggerated, I cannot conceive. It is hardly credible that\r\nit is a case of compensation. All this makes me very anxious to examine\r\nsome plant (if possible one of the Leguminosae) with either the terminal\r\nor lateral leaflets greatly reduced in size, in comparison with the\r\nother leaflets on the same leaf. Can you or any of your colleagues think\r\nof any such plant? It is indirectly on this account that I so much want\r\nthe seeds of Lathyrus nissolia.\r\n\r\nI hear from Frank that you think that the absence of both lateral\r\nleaflets, or of one alone, is due to their having dropped off; I thought\r\nso at first, and examined extremely young leaves from the tips of the\r\nshoots, and some of them presented the same characters. Some appearances\r\nmake me think that they abort by becoming confluent with the main\r\npetiole.\r\n\r\nI hear also that you doubt about the little leaflets ever standing not\r\nopposite to each other: pray look at the enclosed old leaf which\r\nhas been for a time in spirits, and can you call the little leaflets\r\nopposite? I have seen many such cases on both my plants, though few so\r\nwell marked.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 719. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 23rd [1873].\r\n\r\nHow good you have been about the plants; but indeed I did not intend\r\nyou to write about Drosophyllum, though I shall be very glad to have\r\na specimen. Experiments on other plants lead to fresh experiments.\r\nNeptunia is evidently a hopeless case. I shall be very glad of the other\r\nplants whenever they are ready. I constantly fear that I shall become to\r\nyou a giant of bores.\r\n\r\nI am delighted to hear that you are at work on Nepenthes, and I hope\r\nthat you will have good luck. It is good news that the fluid is acid;\r\nyou ought to collect a good lot and have the acid analysed. I hope\r\nthat the work will give you as much pleasure as analogous work has me.\r\n(719/1. Hooker's work on Nepenthes is referred to in \"Insectivorous\r\nPlants,\" page 97: see also his address at the Belfast meeting of the\r\nBritish Association, 1874.) I do not think any discovery gave me more\r\npleasure than proving a true act of digestion in Drosera.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 720. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 24th, 1873.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly interested by Mimosa albida, on which I have been\r\nworking hard. Whilst your memory is pretty fresh, I want to ask a\r\nquestion. When this plant was most sensitive, and you irritated it, did\r\nthe opposite leaflets shut up quite close, as occurs during sleep, when\r\neven a lancet could not be inserted between the leaflets? I can never\r\ncause the leaflets to come into contact, and some reasons make me doubt\r\nwhether they ever do so except during sleep; and this makes me wish much\r\nto hear from you. I grieve to say that the plant looks more unhealthy,\r\neven, than it was at Kew. I have nursed it like the tenderest infant;\r\nbut I was forced to cut off one leaf to try the bloom, and one was\r\nbroken by the manner of packing. I have never syringed (with tepid\r\nwater) more than one leaf per day; but if it dies, I shall feel like a\r\nmurderer. I am pretty well convinced that I shall make out my case of\r\nmovements as a protection against rain lodging on the leaves. As far as\r\nI have as yet made out, M. albida is a splendid case.\r\n\r\nI have had no time to examine more than one species of Eucalyptus. The\r\nseedlings of Lathyrus nissolia are very interesting to me; and there is\r\nsomething wonderful about them, unless seeds of two distinct leguminous\r\nspecies have got somehow mingled together.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 721. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, December 4th, 1873.\r\n\r\nAs Hooker is so busy, I should be very much obliged if you could give\r\nme the name of the enclosed poor specimen of Cassia. I want much to\r\nknow its name, as its power of movement, when it goes to sleep, is very\r\nremarkable. Linnaeus, I find, was aware of this. It twists each separate\r\nleaflet almost completely round (721/1. See \"Power of Movement in\r\nPlants,\" Figure 154, page 370.), so that the lower surface faces the\r\nsky, at the same time depressing them all. The terminal leaflets are\r\npointed towards the base of the leaf. The whole leaf is also raised\r\nup about 12 deg. When I saw that it possessed such complex powers of\r\nmovement, I thought it would utilise its power to protect the leaflets\r\nfrom rain. Accordingly I syringed the plant for two minutes, and it was\r\nreally beautiful to see how each leaflet on the younger leaves twisted\r\nits short sub-petiole, so that the blade was immediately directed at\r\nan angle between 45 and 90 deg to the horizon. I could not resist the\r\npleasure of just telling you why I want to know the name of the Cassia.\r\nI should add that it is a greenhouse plant. I suppose that there will\r\nnot be any better flowers till next summer or autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 722. TO T. BELT.\r\n\r\n(722/1. Belt's account, discussed in this letter, is probably that\r\npublished in his \"Naturalist in Nicaragua\" (1874), where he describes\r\n\"the relation between the presence of honey-secreting glands on plants,\r\nand the protection to the latter secured by the attendance of ants\r\nattracted by the honey.\" (Op. cit., pages 222 et seq.))\r\n\r\nThursday [1874?].\r\n\r\nYour account of the ants and their relations seems to me to possess\r\nextraordinary interest. I do not doubt that the excretion of sweet fluid\r\nby the glands is in your cases of great advantage to the plants by means\r\nof the ants, but I cannot avoid believing that primordially it is a\r\nsimple excretion, as occasionally occurs from the surface of the leaves\r\nof lime trees. It is quite possible that the primordial excretion may\r\nhave been beneficially increased to serve the plant. In the common\r\nlaurel [Prunus laurocerasus] of our gardens the hive-bees visit\r\nincessantly the glands of the young leaves, on their under sides; and I\r\nshould altogether doubt whether their visits or the occasional visits of\r\nants was of any service to the laurel. The stipules of the common vetch\r\nsecrete largely during sunshine, and hive-bees collect the sweet fluid.\r\nSo I think it is with the common bean.\r\n\r\nI am writing this away from home, and I have come away to get some rest,\r\nhaving been a good deal overworked. I shall read your book with great\r\ninterest when published, but will not trouble you to send the MS., as I\r\nreally have no spare strength or time. I believe that your book, judging\r\nby the chapter sent, will be extremely valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 723. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(723/1. The following letter refers to Darwin's prediction as to the\r\nmanner in which Hedychium (Zinziberaceae) is fertilised. Sir J.D. Hooker\r\nseems to have made inquiries in India in consequence of which\r\nDarwin received specimens of the moth which there visits the flower,\r\nunfortunately so much broken as to be useless (see \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nIII., page 284).)\r\n\r\nDown, March 25th [1874].\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear about the Hedychium, and how soon you have got an\r\nanswer! I hope that the wings of the Sphinx will hereafter prove to\r\nbe bedaubed with pollen, for the case will then prove a fine bit of\r\nprophecy from the structure of a flower to special and new means of\r\nfertilisation.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I suppose you have noticed what a grand appearance the plant\r\nmakes when the green capsules open, and display the orange and crimson\r\nseeds and interior, so as to attract birds, like the pale buff flowers\r\nto attract dusk-flying lepidoptera. I presume you do not want seeds of\r\nthis plant, as I have plenty from artificial fertilisation.\r\n\r\n(723/2. In \"Nature,\" June 22nd, 1876, page 173, Hermann Muller\r\ncommunicated F. Muller's observation on the fertilisation of a\r\nbright-red-flowered species of Hedychium, which is visited by\r\nCallidryas, chiefly the males of C. Philea. The pollen is carried by the\r\ntips of the butterfly's wing, to which it is temporarily fixed by the\r\nslimy layer produced by the degeneration of the anther-wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 724. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, June 4th [1874].\r\n\r\nI am greatly obliged to you about the Opuntia, and shall be glad if you\r\ncan remember Catalpa. I wish some facts on the action of water, because\r\nI have been so surprised at a stream not acting on Dionoea and Drosera.\r\n(724/1. See Pfeffer, \"Untersuchungen Bot. Inst. zu Tubingen,\" Bd.\r\nI., 1885, page 518. Pfeffer shows that in some cases--Drosera, for\r\ninstance--water produces movement only when it contains fine particles\r\nin suspension. According to Pfeffer the stamens of Berberis, and the\r\nstigma of Mimulus, are both stimulated by gelatine, the action of which\r\nis, generally speaking, equivalent to that of water.) Water does not\r\nact on the stamens of Berberis, but it does on the stigma of Mimulus.\r\nIt causes the flowers of the bedding-out Mesembryanthemum and Drosera\r\nto close, but it has not this effect on Gazania and the daisy, so I can\r\nmake out no rule.\r\n\r\nI hope you are going on with Nepenthes; and if so, you will perhaps like\r\nto hear that I have just found out that Pinguicula can digest albumen,\r\ngelatine, etc. If a bit of glass or wood is placed on a leaf, the\r\nsecretion is not increased; but if an insect or animal-matter is thus\r\nplaced, the secretion is greatly increased and becomes feebly acid,\r\nwhich was not the case before. I have been astonished and much disturbed\r\nby finding that cabbage seeds excite a copious secretion, and am now\r\nendeavouring to discover what this means. (724/2. Clearly it had not\r\noccurred to Darwin that seeds may supply nitrogenous food as well as\r\ninsects: see \"Insectivorous Plants,\" page 390.) Probably in a few days'\r\ntime I shall have to beg a little information from you, so I will write\r\nno more now.\r\n\r\nP.S. I heard from Asa Gray a week ago, and he tells me a beautiful fact:\r\nnot only does the lid of Sarracenia secrete a sweet fluid, but there\r\nis a line or trail of sweet exudation down to the ground so as to tempt\r\ninsects up. (724/3. A dried specimen of Sarracenia, stuffed with cotton\r\nwool, was sometimes brought from his study by Mr. Darwin, and made the\r\nsubject of a little lecture to visitors of natural history tastes.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 725. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, June 23rd, 1874.\r\n\r\nI wrote to you about a week ago, thanking you for information on cabbage\r\nseeds, asking you the name of Luzula or Carex, and on some other points;\r\nand I hope before very long to receive an answer. You must now, if you\r\ncan, forgive me for being very troublesome, for I am in that state in\r\nwhich I would sacrifice friend or foe. I have ascertained that bits\r\nof certain leaves, for instance spinach, excite much secretion in\r\nPinguicula, and that the glands absorb matter from the leaves. Now this\r\nmorning I have received a lot of leaves from my future daughter-in-law\r\nin North Wales, having a surprising number of captured insects on them,\r\na good many leaves, and two seed-capsules. She informs me that the\r\nlittle leaves had excited secretion; and my son and I have ascertained\r\nthis morning that the protoplasm in the glands beneath the little leaves\r\nhas undoubtedly undergone aggregation. Therefore, absurd as it\r\nmay sound, I am prepared to affirm that Pinguicula is not only\r\ninsectivorous, but graminivorous, and granivorous! Now I want to beg you\r\nto look under the simple microscope at the enclosed leaves and seeds,\r\nand, if you possibly can, tell me their genera. The little narrow leaves\r\nare remarkable (725/1. Those of Erica tetralix.); they are fleshy, with\r\nthe edges much curled from the axis of the plant, and bear a few long\r\nglandular hairs; these grow in little tufts. These are the commonest in\r\nPinguicula, and seem to afford most nutritious matter. A second leaf is\r\nlike a miniature sycamore. With respect to the seeds, I suppose that\r\none is a Carex; the other looks like that of Rumex, but is enclosed in a\r\nglobular capsule. The Pinguicula grew on marshy, low, mountainous land.\r\n\r\nI hope you will think this subject sufficiently interesting to make you\r\nwilling to aid me as far as you can. Anyhow, forgive me for being so\r\nvery troublesome.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 726. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 30th [1874].\r\n\r\nI am particularly obliged for your address. (726/1. Presidential address\r\n(Biological Section) at the Belfast meeting of the British Association,\r\n1874.) It strikes me as quite excellent, and has interested me in the\r\nhighest degree. Nor is this due to my having worked at the subject, for\r\nI feel sure that I should have been just as much struck, perhaps more\r\nso, if I had known nothing about it. You could not, in my opinion, have\r\nput the case better. There are several lights (besides the facts) in\r\nyour essay new to me, and you have greatly honoured me. I heartily\r\ncongratulate you on so splendid a piece of work. There is a misprint at\r\npage 7, Mitschke for Nitschke. There is a partial error at page 8, where\r\nyou say that Drosera is nearly indifferent to organic substances. This\r\nis much too strong, though they do act less efficiently than organic\r\nwith soluble nitrogenous matter; but the chief difference is in the\r\nwidely different period of subsequent re-expansion. Thirdly, I did not\r\nsuggest to Sanderson his electrical experiments, though, no doubt, my\r\nremarks led to his thinking of them.\r\n\r\nNow for your letter: you are very generous about Dionoea, but some of\r\nmy experiments will require cutting off leaves, and therefore injuring\r\nplants. I could not write to Lady Dorothy [Nevill]. Rollisson says that\r\nthey expect soon a lot from America. If Dionoea is not despatched, have\r\nmarked on address, \"to be forwarded by foot-messenger.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Barber's paper is very curious, and ought to be published (726/2.\r\nMrs. Barber's paper on the pupa of Papilio Nireus assuming different\r\ntints corresponding to the objects to which it was attached, was\r\ncommunicated by Mr. Darwin to the \"Trans. Entomolog. Soc.\" 1874.); but\r\nwhen you come here (and REMEMBER YOU OFFERED TO COME) we will consult\r\nwhere to send it. Let me hear when you recommence on Cephalotus or\r\nSarracenia, as I think I am now on right track about Utricularia, after\r\nwasting several weeks in fruitless trials and observations. The negative\r\nwork takes five times more time than the positive.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 727. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 18th [1874].\r\n\r\nI have had a splendid day's work, and must tell you about it.\r\n\r\nLady Dorothy sent me a young plant of U[tricularia] montana (727/1. See\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" III., page 327, and \"Insectivorous Plants,\" page\r\n431.), which I fancy is the species you told me of. The roots or\r\nrhizomes (for I know not which they are; I can see no scales or\r\ninternodes or absorbent hairs) bear scores of bladders from 1/20 to\r\n1/100 of an inch in diameter; and I traced these roots to the depth of 1\r\n1/2 in. in the peat and sand. The bladders are like glass, and have the\r\nsame essential structure as those of our species, with the exception\r\nthat many exterior parts are aborted. Internally the structure is\r\nperfect, as is the minute valvular opening into the bladder, which is\r\nfilled with water. I then felt sure that they captured subterranean\r\ninsects, and after a time I found two with decayed remnants, with clear\r\nproof that something had been absorbed, which had generated protoplasm.\r\nWhen you are here I shall be very curious to know whether they are roots\r\nor rhizomes.\r\n\r\nBesides the bladders there are great tuber-like swellings on the\r\nrhizomes; one was an inch in length and half in breadth. I suppose\r\nthese must have been described. I strongly suspect that they serve as\r\nreservoirs for water. (727/2. The existence of water-stores is quite\r\nin accordance with the epiphytic habit of the plant.) But I shall\r\nexperimentise on this head. A thin slice is a beautiful object, and\r\nlooks like coarsely reticulated glass.\r\n\r\nIf you have an old plant which could be turned out of its pot (and can\r\nspare the time), it would be a great gain to me if you would tear off a\r\nbit of the roots near the bottom, and shake them well in water, and see\r\nwhether they bear these minute glass-like bladders. I should also much\r\nlike to know whether old plants bear the solid bladder-like bodies near\r\nthe upper surface of the pot. These bodies are evidently enlargements\r\nof the roots or rhizomes. You must forgive this long letter, and\r\nmake allowance for my delight at finding this new sub-group of\r\ninsect-catchers. Sir E. Tennent speaks of an aquatic species of\r\nUtricularia in Ceylon, which has bladders on its roots, and rises\r\nannually to the surface, as he says, by this means. (727/3. Utricularia\r\nstellaris. Emerson Tennent's \"Ceylon,\" Volume I., page 124, 1859.)\r\n\r\nWe shall be delighted to see you here on the 26th; if you will let us\r\nknow your train we will send to meet you. You will have to work like a\r\nslave while you are here.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 728. TO J. JENNER WEIR.\r\n\r\n(728/1. In 1870 Mr. Jenner Weir wrote to Darwin: \"My brother has but\r\ntwo kinds of laburnum, viz., Cytisus purpureus, very erect, and Cytisus\r\nalpinus, very pendulous. He has several stocks of the latter grafted\r\nwith the purple one; and this year, the grafts being two years old,\r\nI saw in one, fairly above the stock, about four inches, a raceme of\r\npurely yellow flowers with the usual dark markings, and above them a\r\nbunch of purely purple flowers; the branches of the graft in no way\r\nshowed an intermediate character, but had the usual rigid growth of\r\npurpureus.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in July 1875, when Darwin was correcting a new edition of\r\n\"Variation under Domestication,\" he again corresponded with Mr. Weir on\r\nthe subject.)\r\n\r\nDown, July 8th [1875].\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially. The case interests me in a higher degree than\r\nanything which I have heard for a very long time. Is it your brother\r\nHarrison W., whom I know? I should like to hear where the garden is.\r\nThere is one other very important point which I am most anxious to\r\nhear--viz., the nature of the leaves at the base of the yellow racemes,\r\nfor leaves are always there produced with the yellow laburnums, and I\r\nsuppose so in the case of C. purpureus. As the tree has produced yellow\r\nracemes several times, do you think you could ask your brother to cut\r\noff and send me by post in a box a small branch of the purple stock with\r\nthe pods or leaves of the yellow sport? (728/2. \"The purple stock\" here\r\nmeans the supposed C. purpureus, on which a yellow-flowered branch was\r\nborne.) This would be an immense favour, for then I would cut the point\r\nof junction longitudinally and examine slice under the microscope, to be\r\nable to state no trace of bud of yellow kind having been inserted. I do\r\nnot suspect anything of the kind, but it is sure to be said that your\r\nbrother's gardener, either by accident or fraud, inserted a bud. Under\r\nthis point of view it would be very good to gather from your brother how\r\nmany times the yellow sport has appeared. The case appears to me so\r\nvery important as to be worth any trouble. Very many thanks for all\r\nassistance so kindly given.\r\n\r\nI will of course send a copy of new edition of \"Variation under\r\nDomestication\" when published in the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 729. TO J. JENNER WEIR.\r\n\r\n(729/1. On July 9th Mr. Weir wrote to say that a branch of the Cytisus\r\nhad been despatched to Down. The present letter was doubtless\r\nwritten after Darwin had examined the specimen. In \"Variation under\r\nDomestication,\" Edition II., Volume I., page 417, note, he gives for a\r\ncase recorded in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" in 1857 the explanation here\r\noffered (viz. that the graft was not C. purpureus but C. Adami), and\r\nadds, \"I have ascertained that this occurred in another instance.\" This\r\nsecond instance is doubtless Mr. Weir's.)\r\n\r\nDown, July 10th, 1875.\r\n\r\nI do not know how to thank you enough; pray give also my thanks and kind\r\nremembrances to your brother. I am sure you will forgive my expressing\r\nmy doubts freely, as I well know that you desire the truth more than\r\nanything else. I cannot avoid the belief that some nurseryman has sold\r\nC[ytisus] Adami to your brother in place of the true C. purpureus. The\r\nlatter is a little bush only 3 feet high (Loudon), and when I read your\r\naccount, it seemed to me a physical impossibility that a sporting branch\r\nof C. alpinus could grow to any size and be supported on the extremely\r\ndelicate branches of C. purpureus. If I understand rightly your letter,\r\nyou consider the tuft of small shoots on one side of the sporting C.\r\nalpinus from Weirleigh as C. purpureus; but these shoots are certainly\r\nthose of C. Adami. I earnestly beg you to look at the specimens\r\nenclosed. The branch of the true C. purpureus is the largest which\r\nI could find. If C. Adami was sold to your brother as C. purpureus,\r\neverything is explained; for then the gardener has grafted C. Adami on\r\nC. alpinus, and the former has sported in the usual manner; but has not\r\nsported into C. purpureus, only into C. alpinus. C. Adami does not sport\r\nless frequently into C. purpureus than into C. alpinus. Are the purple\r\nflowers borne on moderately long racemes? If so, the plant is certainly\r\nC. Adami, for the true C. purpureus bears flowers close to the branches.\r\nI am very sorry to be so troublesome, but I am very anxious to hear\r\nagain from you.\r\n\r\nC. purpureus bears \"flowers axillary, solitary, stalked.\"\r\n\r\nP.S.--I think you said that the purple [tree] at Weirleigh does not\r\nseed, whereas the C. purpureus seeds freely, as you may see in enclosed.\r\nC. Adami never produces seeds or pods.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 730. TO E. HACKEL.\r\n\r\n(730/1. The following extract refers to Darwin's book on \"Cross and\r\nSelf-Fertilisation.\")\r\n\r\nNovember 13th, 1875.\r\n\r\nI am now busy in drawing up an account of ten years' experiments in the\r\ngrowth and fertility of plants raised from crossed and self-fertilised\r\nflowers. It is really wonderful what an effect pollen from a distinct\r\nseedling plant, which has been exposed to different conditions of life,\r\nhas on the offspring in comparison with pollen from the same flower or\r\nfrom a distinct individual, but which has been long subjected to the\r\nsame conditions. The subject bears on the very principle of life, which\r\nseems almost to require changes in the conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 731. TO G.J. ROMANES.\r\n\r\n(731/1. The following extract from a letter to Romanes refers to Francis\r\nDarwin's paper, \"Experiments on the Nutrition of Drosera rotundifolia.\"\r\n\"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" [1878], published 1880, page 17.)\r\n\r\nAugust 9th [1876].\r\n\r\nThe second point which delights me, seeing that half a score of\r\nbotanists throughout Europe have published that the digestion of meat by\r\nplants is of no use to them (a mere pathological phenomenon, as one man\r\nsays!), is that Frank has been feeding under exactly similar conditions\r\na large number of plants of Drosera, and the effect is wonderful. On\r\nthe fed side the leaves are much larger, differently coloured, and more\r\nnumerous; flower-stalks taller and more numerous, and I believe far\r\nmore seed capsules,--but these not yet counted. It is particularly\r\ninteresting that the leaves fed on meat contain very many more starch\r\ngranules (no doubt owing to more protoplasm being first formed); so that\r\nsections stained with iodine, of fed and unfed leaves, are to the naked\r\neye of very different colours.\r\n\r\nThere, I have boasted to my heart's content, and do you do the same, and\r\ntell me what you have been doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 732. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 25th [1876].\r\n\r\nIf you can put the following request into any one's hands pray do so;\r\nbut if not, ignore my request, as I know how busy you are.\r\n\r\nI want any and all plants of Hoya examined to see if any imperfect\r\nflowers like the one enclosed can be found, and if so to send them to\r\nme, per post, damp. But I especially want them as young as possible.\r\n\r\nThey are very curious. I have examined some sent me from Abinger (732/1.\r\nLord Farrer's house.), but they were a month or two too old, and every\r\ntrace of pollen and anthers had disappeared or had never been developed.\r\nYet a very fine pod with apparently good seed had been formed by one\r\nsuch flower. (732/2. The seeds did not germinate; see the account of\r\nHoya carnosa in \"Forms of Flowers,\" page 331.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 733. TO G.J. ROMANES.\r\n\r\n(733/1. Published in the \"Life of Romanes,\" page 62.)\r\n\r\nDown, August 10th [1877].\r\n\r\nWhen I went yesterday I had not received to-day's \"Nature,\" and I\r\nthought that your lecture was finished. (733/2. Abstract of a lecture\r\non \"Evolution of Nerves and Nervo-Systems,\" delivered at the Royal\r\nInstitution, May 25th, 1877. \"Nature,\" July 19th, August 2nd, August\r\n9th, 1877.) This final part is one of the grandest essays which I ever\r\nread.\r\n\r\nIt was very foolish of me to demur to your lines of conveyance like the\r\nthreads in muslin (733/3. \"Nature,\" August 2nd, page 271.), knowing how\r\nyou have considered the subject: but still I must confess I cannot feel\r\nquite easy. Everyone, I suppose, thinks on what he has himself seen, and\r\nwith Drosera, a bit of meat put on any one gland on its disc causes\r\nall the surrounding tentacles to bend to this point, and here there can\r\nhardly be differentiated lines of conveyance. It seems to me that the\r\ntentacles probably bend to that point wherever a molecular wave strikes\r\nthem, which passes through the cellular tissue with equal ease in all\r\ndirections in this particular case. (733/4. Speaking generally, the\r\ntransmission takes place more readily in the longitudinal direction than\r\nacross the leaf: see \"Insectivorous Plants,\" page 239.) But what a fine\r\ncase that of the Aurelia is! (733/5. Aurelia aurita, one of the medusae.\r\n\"Nature,\" pages 269-71.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 734. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. 6, Queen Anne Street [December 1876].\r\n\r\nTell Hooker I feel greatly aggrieved by him: I went to the Royal Society\r\nto see him for once in the chair of the Royal, to admire his dignity and\r\nenjoy it, and lo and behold, he was not there. My outing gave me much\r\nsatisfaction, and I was particularly glad to see Mr. Bentham, and to see\r\nhim looking so wonderfully well and young. I saw lots of people, and it\r\nhas not done me a penny's worth of harm, though I could not get to sleep\r\ntill nearly four o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 735. TO D. OLIVER. Down, October, 13th [1876?].\r\n\r\nYou must be a clair-voyant or something of that kind to have sent me\r\nsuch useful plants. Twenty-five years ago I described in my father's\r\ngarden two forms of Linum flavum (thinking it a case of mere variation);\r\nfrom that day to this I have several times looked, but never saw the\r\nsecond form till it arrived from Kew. Virtue is never its own reward:\r\nI took paper this summer to write to you to ask you to send me flowers,\r\n[so] that I might beg plants of this Linum, if you had the other form,\r\nand refrained, from not wishing to trouble you. But I am now sorry\r\nI did, for I have hardly any doubt that L. flavum never seeds in any\r\ngarden that I have seen, because one form alone is cultivated by slips.\r\n(735/1. Id est, because, the plant being grown from slips, one form\r\nalone usually occurs in any one garden. It is also arguable that it is\r\ngrown by slips because only one form is common, and therefore seedlings\r\ncannot be raised.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(736/1. The following five letters refer to Darwin's work on \"bloom\"--a\r\nsubject on which he did not live to complete his researches:--\r\n\r\nOne of his earliest letters on this subject was addressed in August,\r\n1873, to Sir Joseph Hooker (736/2. Published in \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nIII., page 339.):\r\n\r\n\"I want a little information from you, and if you do not yourself know,\r\nplease to enquire of some of the wise men of Kew.\r\n\r\n\"Why are the leaves and fruit of so many plants protected by a thin\r\nlayer of waxy matter (like the common cabbage), or with fine hair, so\r\nthat when such leaves or fruit are immersed in water they appear as if\r\nencased in thin glass? It is really a pretty sight to put a pod of the\r\ncommon pea, or a raspberry, into water. I find several leaves are thus\r\nprotected on the under surface and not on the upper.\r\n\r\n\"How can water injure the leaves, if indeed this is at all the case?\"\r\n\r\nOn this latter point Darwin wrote to the late Lord Farrer:\r\n\r\n\"I am now become mad about drops of water injuring leaves. Please ask\r\nMr. Payne (736/3. Lord Farrer's gardener.) whether he believes, FROM\r\nHIS OWN EXPERIENCE, that drops of water injure leaves or fruit in his\r\nconservatories. It is said that the drops act as burning-glasses; if\r\nthis is true, they would not be at all injurious on cloudy days. As\r\nhe is so acute a man, I should very much like to hear his opinion. I\r\nremember when I grew hothouse orchids I was cautioned not to wet their\r\nleaves; but I never then thought on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter, though of later date than some which follow it, is\r\nprinted here because it briefly sums his results and serves as guide to\r\nthe letters dealing with the subject.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 736. TO W. THISELTON-DYER.\r\n\r\n(736/4. Published in \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 341.)\r\n\r\nDown, September 5th [1877].\r\n\r\nOne word to thank you. I declare, had it not been for your kindness,\r\nwe should have broken down. As it is we have made out clearly that with\r\nsome plants (chiefly succulent) the bloom checks evaporation--with\r\nsome certainly prevents attacks of insects; with SOME sea-shore plants\r\nprevents injury from salt water, and, I believe, with a few prevents\r\ninjury from pure water resting on the leaves. This latter is as yet\r\nthe most doubtful and the most interesting point in relation to the\r\nmovements of plants.\r\n\r\n(736/5. Modern research, especially that of Stahl on transpiration\r\n(\"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1897, page 71) has shown that the question is more\r\ncomplex than it appeared in 1877. Stahl's point of view is that moisture\r\nremaining on a leaf checks the transpiration-current; and by thus\r\ndiminishing the flow of mineral nutriment interferes with the process of\r\nassimilation. Stahl's idea is doubtless applicable to the whole problem\r\nof bloom on leaves. For other references to bloom see letters 685, 689\r\nand 693.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 737. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 19th, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe next time you walk round the garden ask Mr. Smith (737/1. Probably\r\nJohn Smith (1798-1888), for some years Curator, Royal Gardens, Kew.), or\r\nany of your best men, what they think about injury from watering during\r\nsunshine. One of your men--viz., Mr. Payne, at Abinger, who seems very\r\nacute--declares that you may water safely any plant out of doors in\r\nsunshine, and that you may do the same for plants under glass if the\r\nsashes are opened. This seems to me very odd, but he seems positive\r\non the point, and acts on it in raising splendid grapes. Another good\r\ngardener maintains that it is only COLD water dripping often on the\r\nsame point of a leaf that ever injures it. I am utterly perplexed, but\r\ninterested on the point. Give me what you learn when you come to Down.\r\n\r\nI should like to hear what plants are believed to be most injured by\r\nbeing watered in sunshine, so that I might get such.\r\n\r\nI expect that I shall be utterly beaten, as on so many other points;\r\nbut I intend to make a few experiments and observations. I have already\r\nconvinced myself that drops of water do NOT act as burning lenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 738. TO J.D. HOOKER. December 20th [1873].\r\n\r\nI find that it is no use going on with my experiments on the evil\r\neffects of water on bloom-divested leaves. Either I erred in the early\r\nautumn or summer in some incomprehensible manner, or, as I suspect to be\r\nthe case, water is only injurious to leaves when there is a good supply\r\nof actinic rays. I cannot believe that I am all in the wrong about the\r\nmovements of the leaves to shoot off water.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of all this is that I want to keep all the plants from Kew\r\nuntil the spring or early summer, as it is mere waste of time going on\r\nat present.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 739. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, July 22nd [1877].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for seeds of the Malva and information about Averrhoa, which\r\nI perceived was sensitive, as A. carambola is said to be; and about\r\nMimosa sensitiva. The log-wood [Haematoxylon] has interested me much.\r\nThe wax is very easily removed, especially from the older leaves, and I\r\nfound after squirting on the leaves with water at 95 deg, all the older\r\nleaves became coated, after forty-eight hours, in an astonishing manner\r\nwith a black Uredo, so that they looked as if sprinkled with soot and\r\nwater. But not one of the younger leaves was affected. This has set\r\nme to work to see whether the \"bloom\" is not a protection against\r\nparasites. As soon as I have ascertained a little more about the case\r\n(and generally I am quite wrong at first) I will ask whether I could\r\nhave a very small plant, which should never be syringed with water above\r\n60 deg, and then I suspect the leaves would not be spotted, as were the\r\nolder ones on the plant, when it arrived from Kew, but nothing like what\r\nthey were after my squirting.\r\n\r\nIn an old note of yours (which I have just found) you say that you have\r\na sensitive Schrankia: could this be lent me?\r\n\r\nI have had lent me a young Coral-tree (Erythrina), which is very sickly,\r\nyet shows odd sleep movements. I suppose I could buy one, but Hooker\r\ntold me first to ask you for anything.\r\n\r\nLastly, have you any seaside plants with bloom? I find that drops of\r\nsea-water corrode sea-kale if bloom is removed; also the var. littorum\r\nof Triticum repens. (By the way, my plants of the latter, grown in pots\r\nhere, are now throwing up long flexible green blades, and it is very odd\r\nto see, ON THE SAME CULM, the rigid grey bloom-covered blades and the\r\ngreen flexible ones.) Cabbages, ill-luck to them, do not seem to be\r\nhurt by salt water. Hooker formerly told me that Salsola kali, a var. of\r\nSalicornia, one species of Suaeda, Euphorbia peplis, Lathyrus maritimus,\r\nEryngium maritimum, were all glaucous and seaside plants. It is very\r\nimprobable that you have any of these or of foreigners with the same\r\nattributes.\r\n\r\nGod forgive me: I hope that I have not bored you greatly.\r\n\r\nBy all the rules of right the leaves of the logwood ought to move (as if\r\npartially going to sleep) when syringed with tepid water. The leaves\r\nof my little plant do not move at all, and it occurs to me as possible,\r\nthough very improbable, that it would be different with a larger plant\r\nwith perhaps larger leaves. Would you some day get a gardener to syringe\r\nviolently, with water kept in a hothouse, a branch on one of your\r\nlargest logwood plants and observe [whether?] leaves move together\r\ntowards the apex of leaf?\r\n\r\nBy the way, what astonishing nonsense Mr. Andrew Murray has been\r\nwriting about leaves and carbonic acid! I like to see a man behaving\r\nconsistently...\r\n\r\nWhat a lot I have scribbled to you!\r\n\r\n\r\n(FIGURE 13. Leaf of Trifolium resupinatum (from a drawing by Miss\r\nPertz).)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 740. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. [August, 1877.]\r\n\r\nThere is no end to my requests. Can you spare me a good plant (or even\r\ntwo) of Oxalis sensitiva? The one which I have (formerly from Kew) has\r\nbeen so maltreated that I dare not trust my results any longer.\r\n\r\nPlease give the enclosed to Mr. Lynch. (740/1. Mr. Lynch, now Curator\r\nof the Cambridge Botanic Garden, was at this time in the R. Bot. Garden,\r\nKew. Mr. Lynch described the movements of Averrhoa bilimbi in the \"Linn.\r\nSoc. Journ,\" Volume XVI., page 231. See also \"The Power of Movement in\r\nPlants,\" page 330.) The spontaneous movements of the Averrhoa are very\r\ncurious.\r\n\r\nYou sent me seeds of Trifolium resupinatum, and I have raised plants,\r\nand some former observations which I did not dare to trust have proved\r\naccurate. It is a very little fact, but curious. The half of the lateral\r\nleaflets (marked by a cross) on the lower side have no bloom and are\r\nwetted, whereas the other half has bloom and is not wetted, so that the\r\ntwo sides look different to the naked eye. The cells of the eipdermis\r\nappear of a different shape and size on the two sides of the leaf\r\n[Figure 13].\r\n\r\nWhen we have drawings and measurements of cells made, and are sure of\r\nour facts, I shall ask you whether you know of any case of the same leaf\r\ndiffering histologically on the two sides, for Hooker always says you\r\nare a wonderful man for knowing what has been made out.\r\n\r\n(740/2. The biological meaning of the curious structure of the leaves of\r\nTrifolium resupinatum remains a riddle. The stomata and (speaking from\r\nmemory) the trichomes differ on the two halves of the lateral leaflets.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 741. TO L. ERRERA.\r\n\r\n(741/1. Professor L. Errera, of Brussels wrote, as a student, to Darwin,\r\nasking permission to send the MS. of an essay by his friend S. Gevaert\r\nand himself on cross and self-fertilisation, and which was afterwards\r\npublished in the \"Bull. Soc. Bot. Belg.\" XVII., 1878. The terms\r\nxenogamy, geitonogamy, and autogamy were first suggested by Kerner in\r\n1876; their definition will be found at page 9 of Ogle's translation\r\nof Kerner's \"Flowers and their Unbidden Guests,\" 1878. In xenogamy the\r\npollen comes from another PLANT; in geitonogamy from another FLOWER\r\non the same PLANT; in autogamy from the androecium of the fertilised\r\nFLOWER. Allogamy embraces xenogamy and geitonogamy.)\r\n\r\nDown, October 4th, 1877.\r\n\r\nI have now read your MS. The whole has interested me greatly, and\r\nis very clearly written. I wish that I had used some such terms as\r\nautogamy, xenogamy, etc...I entirely agree with you on the a priori\r\nprobability of geitonogamy being more advantageous than autogamy; and\r\nI cannot remember having ever expressed a belief that autogamy, as a\r\ngeneral rule, was better than geitonogamy; but the cases recorded by\r\nme seem too strong not to make me suspect that there was some unknown\r\nadvantage in autogamy. In one place I insert the caution \"if this\r\nbe really the case,\" which you quote. (741/2. See \"Cross and\r\nSelf-Fertilisation,\" pages 352, 386. The phrase referred to occurs in\r\nboth passages; that on page 386 is as follows: \"We have also seen reason\r\nto suspect that self-fertilisation is in some peculiar manner beneficial\r\nto certain plants; but if this be really the case, the benefit thus\r\nderived is far more than counterbalanced by a cross with a fresh stock\r\nor with a slightly different variety.\" Errera and Gevaert conclude\r\n(pages 79-80) that the balance of the available evidence is in favour of\r\nthe belief that geitonogamy is intermediate, in effectiveness, between\r\nautogamy and xenogamy.) I shall be very glad to be proved to be\r\naltogether in error on this point.\r\n\r\nAccept my thanks for pointing out the bad erratum at page 301. I hope\r\nthat you will experimentise on inconspicuous flowers (741/3. See Miss\r\nBateson, \"Annals of Botany,\" 1888, page 255, \"On the Cross-Fertilisation\r\nof Inconspicuous Flowers:\" Miss Bateson showed that Senecio vulgaris\r\nclearly profits by cross-fertilisation; Stellaria media and Capsella\r\nbursa-pastoris less certainly.); if I were not too old and too much\r\noccupied I would do so myself.\r\n\r\nFinally let me thank you for the kind manner in which you refer to my\r\nwork, and with cordial good wishes for your success...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 742. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, October 9th, 1877.\r\n\r\nOne line to thank you much about Mertensia. The former plant has begun\r\nto make new leaves, to my great surprise, so that I shall be now well\r\nsupplied. We have worked so well with the Averrhoa that unless the\r\nsecond species arrives in a very good state it would be superfluous to\r\nsend it. I am heartily glad that you and Mrs. Dyer are going to have\r\na holiday. I will look at you as a dead man for the next month, and\r\nnothing shall tempt me to trouble you. But before you enter your grave\r\naid me if you can. I want seeds of three or four plants (not Leguminosae\r\nor Cruciferae) which produce large cotyledons. I know not in the least\r\nwhat plants have large cotyledons. Why I want to know is as follows: The\r\ncotyledons of Cassia go to sleep, and are sensitive to a touch; but what\r\nhas surprised me much is that they are in constant movement up and down.\r\nSo it is with the cotyledons of the cabbage, and therefore I am very\r\ncurious to ascertain how far this is general.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 743. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, October 11th [1877].\r\n\r\nThe fine lot of seeds arrived yesterday, and are all sown, and will be\r\nmost useful. If you remember, pray thank Mr. Lynch for his aid. I had\r\nnot thought of beech or sycamore, but they are now sown.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you may like to see a rough copy of the tracing of movements\r\nof one of the cotyledons of red cabbage, and you can throw it into\r\nthe fire. A line joining the two cotyledons stood facing a north-east\r\nwindow, and the day was uniformly cloudy. A bristle was gummed to one\r\ncotyledon, and beyond it a triangular bit of card was fixed, and in\r\nfront a vertical glass. A dot was made in the glass every quarter or\r\nhalf hour at the point where the end of the bristle and the apex of card\r\ncoincided, and the dots were joined by straight lines. The observations\r\nwere from 10 a.m. to 8.45 p.m. During this time the enclosed figure was\r\ndescribed; but between 4 p.m. and 5.38 p.m. the cotyledon moved so that\r\nthe prolonged line was beyond the limits of the glass, and the course\r\nis here shown by an imaginary dotted line. The cotyledon of Primula\r\nsinensis moved in closely analogous manner, as do those of a Cassia.\r\nHence I expect to find such movements very general with cotyledons,\r\nand I am inclined to look at them as the foundation for all the other\r\nadaptive movements of leaves. They certainly are of the so-called sleep\r\nof plants.\r\n\r\nI hope I have not bothered you. Do not answer. I am all on fire at the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI have had a short and very prosperous note from Asa Gray, who says\r\nHooker is very prosperous, and both are tremendously hard at work.\r\n(743/1. \"Hooker is coming over, and we are going in summer to the Rocky\r\nMountains together, according to an old promise of mine.\" Asa Gray to\r\nG.F. Wright, May 24th, 1877 (\"Letters of Asa Gray,\" II., page 666).)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 744. TO H. MULLER. Down, January 1st [1878?].\r\n\r\nI must write two or three lines to thank you cordially for your very\r\nhandsome and very interesting review of my last book in \"Kosmos,\"\r\nwhich I have this minute finished. (744/1. \"Forms of Flowers,\" 1877. H.\r\nMuller's article is in \"Kosmos,\" II., page 286.) It is wonderful how you\r\nhave picked out everything important in it. I am especially glad that\r\nyou have called attention to the parallelism between illegitimate\r\noffspring of heterostyled plants and hybrids. Your previous article in\r\n\"Kosmos\" seemed to me very important, but for some unknown reason the\r\ngerman was very difficult, and I was sadly overworked at the time, so\r\nthat I could not understand a good deal of it. (744/2. \"Kosmos,\" II.,\r\npages 11, 128. See \"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page 308.) But I\r\nhave put it on one side, and when I have to prepare a new edition of my\r\nbook I must make it out. It seems that you attribute such cases as that\r\nof the dioecious Rhamnus and your own of Valeriana to the existence of\r\ntwo forms with larger and smaller flowers. I cannot follow the steps\r\nby which such plants have been rendered dioecious, but when I read your\r\narticle with more care I hope I shall understand. (744/3. See \"Forms of\r\nFlowers,\" Edition II., pages 9 and 304. H. Muller's view is briefly that\r\nconspicuous and less conspicuous varieties occurred, and that the former\r\nwere habitually visited first by insects; thus the less conspicuous form\r\nwould play the part of females and their pollen would tend to become\r\nsuperfluous. See H. Muller in \"Kosmos,\" II.) If you have succeeded\r\nin explaining this class of cases I shall heartily rejoice, for they\r\nutterly perplexed me, and I could not conjecture what their meaning was.\r\nIt is a grievous evil to have no faculty for new languages.\r\n\r\nWith the most sincere respect and hearty good wishes to you and all your\r\nfamily for the new year...\r\n\r\nP.S.--What interesting papers your wonderful brother has lately been\r\nwriting!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 745. TO W. THISELTON-DYER.\r\n\r\n(745/1. This letter refers to the purchase of instruments for the\r\nJodrell Laboratory in the Royal Gardens, Kew. \"The Royal Commission on\r\nScientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science, commonly spoken\r\nof as the Devonshire Commission, in its fourth Report (1874), page 10,\r\nexpressed the opinion that 'it is highly desirable that opportunities\r\nfor the pursuit of investigations in Physiological Botany should be\r\nafforded at Kew to those persons who may be inclined to follow that\r\nbranch of science.' Effect was given to this recommendation by the\r\nliberality of the late T.J. Phillips-Jodrell, M.A., who built and\r\nequipped the small laboratory, which has since borne his name, at his\r\nown expense. It was completed and immediately brought into use in 1876.\"\r\nThe above is taken from the \"Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information,\" R.\r\nBotanic Gardens, Kew, 1901, page 102, which also gives a list of work\r\ncarried out in the laboratory between 1876 and 1900.)\r\n\r\nDown, March 14th, 1878.\r\n\r\nI have a very strong opinion that it would be the greatest possible\r\npity if the Phys[iological] Lab., now that it has been built, were\r\nnot supplied with as many good instruments as your funds can possibly\r\nafford. It is quite possible that some of them may become antiquated\r\nbefore they are much or even at all used. But this does not seem to me\r\nany argument at all against getting them, for the Laboratory cannot be\r\nused until well provided; and the mere fact of the instruments being\r\nready may suggest to some one to use them. You at Kew, as guardians and\r\npromoters of botanical science, will then have done all in your power,\r\nand if your Lab. is not used the disgrace will lie at the feet of the\r\npublic. But until bitter experience proves the contrary I will never\r\nbelieve that we are so backward. I should think the German laboratories\r\nwould be very good guides as to what to get; but Timiriazeff of Moscow,\r\nwho travelled over Europe to see all Bot. Labs., and who seemed so\r\ngood a fellow, would, I should think, give the best list of the most\r\nindispensable instruments. Lately I thought of getting Frank or\r\nHorace to go to Cambridge for the use of the heliostat there; but our\r\nobservations turned out of less importance than I thought, yet if there\r\nhad been one at Kew we should probably have used it, and might have\r\nfound out something curious. It is impossible for me to predict whether\r\nor not we should ever want this or that instrument, for we are guided\r\nin our work by what turns up. Thus I am now observing something about\r\ngeotropism, and I had no idea a few weeks ago that this would have been\r\nnecessary. In a short time we might earnestly wish for a centrifugal\r\napparatus or a heliostat. In all such cases it would make a great\r\ndifference if a man knew that he could use a particular instrument\r\nwithout great loss of time. I have now given my opinion, which is very\r\ndecided, whether right or wrong, and Frank quite agrees with me. You\r\ncan, of course, show this letter to Hooker.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 746. TO F. LUDWIG. Down, May 29th, 1878.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for the trouble which you have taken in sending\r\nme so long and interesting a letter, together with the specimens.\r\nGradations are always very valuable, and you have been remarkably\r\nsuccessful in discovering the stages by which the Plantago has become\r\ngyno-dioecious. (746/1. See F. Ludwig, \"Zeitsch. f. d. Geo. Naturwiss.\"\r\nBd. LII., 1879. Professor Ludwig's observations are quoted in the\r\npreface to \"Forms of Flowers,\" Edition II., page ix.) Your view of its\r\norigin, from being proterogynous, seems to me very probable, especially\r\nas the females are generally the later-flowering plants. If you can\r\nprove the reverse case with Thymus your view will manifestly be rendered\r\nstill more probable. I have never felt satisfied with H. Muller's view,\r\nthough he is so careful and admirable an observer. (746/2. See \"Forms\r\nof Flowers,\" Edition II., page 308. Also letter 744.) It is more than\r\nseventeen years since I attended to Plantago, and when nothing had been\r\npublished on the subject, and in consequence I omitted to attend to\r\nseveral points; and now, after so long an interval, I cannot pretend to\r\nsay to which of your forms the English one belongs; I well remember that\r\nthe anther of the females contained a good deal [of] pollen, though not\r\none sound grain.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Delpino is Professor of Botany in Genoa, Italy (746/3. Now at\r\nNaples.); I have always found him a most obliging correspondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 747. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, August 24th [1878].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for seeds of Trifolium resupinatum, which are invaluable to\r\nus. I enclose seeds of a Cassia, from Fritz Muller, and they are well\r\nworth your cultivation; for he says they come from a unique, large and\r\nbeautiful tree in the interior, and though looking out for years, he\r\nhas never seen another specimen. One of the most splendid, largest and\r\nrarest butterflies in S. Brazil, he has never seen except near this\r\none tree, and he has just discovered that its caterpillars feed on its\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nI have just been looking at fine young pods beneath the ground of\r\nArachis. (747/1. Arachis hypogoea, cultivated for its \"ground nuts.\") I\r\nsuppose that the pods are not withdrawn when ripe from the ground;\r\nbut should this be the case kindly inform me; if I do not hear I shall\r\nunderstand that [the] pods ripen and are left permanently beneath the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIf you ever come across heliotropic or apheliotropic aerial roots on\r\na plant not valuable (but which should be returned), I should like\r\nto observe them. Bignonia capreolata, with its strongly apheliotropic\r\ntendrils (which I had from Kew), is now interesting me greatly. Veitch\r\ntells me it is not on sale in any London nursery, as I applied to him\r\nfor some additional plants. So much for business.\r\n\r\nI have received from the Geographical Soc. your lecture, and read it\r\nwith great interest. (747/2. \"On Plant-Distribution as a field for\r\nGeographical Research.\" \"Geog. Soc. Proc.\" XXII., 1878, page 412.) But\r\nit ought not merely to be read; it requires study. The sole criticism\r\nwhich I have to make is that parts are too much condensed: but, good\r\nLord, how rare a fault is this! You do not quote Saporta, I think; and\r\nsome of his work on the Tertiary plants would have been useful to you.\r\nIn a former note you spoke contemptuously of your lecture: all I can\r\nsay is that I never heard any one speak more unjustly and shamefully of\r\nanother than you have done of yourself!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 748. TO H. MULLER. Down, September 20th, 1878.\r\n\r\nI am working away on some points in vegetable physiology, but though\r\nthey interest me and my son, yet they have none of the fascination which\r\nthe fertilisation of flowers possesses. Nothing in my life has ever\r\ninterested me more than the fertilisation of such plants as Primula and\r\nLythrum, or again Anacamptis (748/1. Orchis pyramidalis.) or Listera.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 749. TO H. MULLER. Down, February 12th [1879].\r\n\r\nI have just heard that some misfortune has befallen you, and that you\r\nhave been treated shamefully. (749/1. Hermann Muller was accused by\r\nthe Ultramontane party of introducing into his school-teaching crude\r\nhypotheses (\"unreife Hypothesen\"), which were assumed to have a harmful\r\ninfluence upon the religious sentiments of his pupils. Attempts were\r\nmade to bring about Muller's dismissal, but the active hostility of his\r\nopponents, which he met in a dignified spirit, proved futile. (\"Prof.\r\nDr. Hermann Muller von Lippstadt. Ein Gedenkblatt,\" von Ernst Krause.\r\n\"Kosmos,\" VII., page 393, 1883.)) I grieve deeply to hear this, and as\r\nsoon as you can find a few minutes to spare, I earnestly beg you to let\r\nme hear what has happened.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 750. TO A. STEPHEN WILSON.\r\n\r\n(750/1. The following letters refer to two forms of wheat cultivated in\r\nRussia under the names Kubanka and Saxonka, which had been sent to Mr.\r\nDarwin by Dr. Asher from Samara, and were placed in the hands of Mr.\r\nWilson that he might test the belief prevalent in Russia that Kubanka\r\n\"grown repeatedly on inferior soil,\" assumes \"the form of Saxonka.\" Mr.\r\nWilson's paper of 1880 gives the results of his inquiry. He concludes\r\n(basing his views partly on analogous cases and partly on his study of\r\nthe Russian wheats) that the supposed transformation is explicable in\r\nchief part by the greater fertility of the Saxonka wheat leading to\r\nextermination of the other form. According to Mr. Wilson, therefore,\r\nthe Saxonka survivors are incorrectly assumed to be the result of the\r\nconversion of one form into the other.)\r\n\r\nDown, April 24th, 1878.\r\n\r\nI send you herewith some specimens which may perhaps interest you, as\r\nyou have so carefully studied the varieties of wheat. Anyhow, they are\r\nof no use to me, as I have neither knowledge nor time sufficient. They\r\nwere sent me by the Governor of the Province of Samara, in Russia, at\r\nthe request of Dr. Asher (son of the great Berlin publisher) who farmed\r\nfor some years in the province. The specimen marked Kubanka is a very\r\nvaluable kind, but which keeps true only when cultivated in fresh\r\nsteppe-land in Samara, and in Saratoff. After two years it degenerates\r\ninto the variety Saxonica, or its synonym Ghirca. The latter alone is\r\nimported into this country. Dr. Asher says that it is universally known,\r\nand he has himself witnessed the fact, that if grain of the Kubanka is\r\nsown in the same steppe-land for more than two years it changes into\r\nSaxonica. He has seen a field with parts still Kubanka and the remainder\r\nSaxonica. On this account the Government, in letting steppe-land,\r\ncontracts that after two years wheat must not be sown until an interval\r\nof eight years. The ears of the two kinds appear different, as you will\r\nsee, but the chief difference is in the quality of the grains. Dr. Asher\r\nhas witnessed sales of equal weights of Kubanka and Saxonica grain,\r\nand the price of the former was to that of the latter as 7 to 4. The\r\npeasants say that the change commences in the terminal grain of the\r\near. The most remarkable point, as Dr. Asher positively asserts, is that\r\nthere are no intermediate varieties; but that a grain produces a plant\r\nyielding either true Kubanka or true Saxonica. He thinks that it would\r\nbe interesting to sow here both kinds in good and bad wheat soil and\r\nobserve the result. Should you think it worth while to make any such\r\ntrial, and should you require further information, Dr. Asher, whose\r\naddress I enclose, will be happy to give any in his power.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 751. TO A. STEPHEN WILSON. Basset, Southampton, April 29th\r\n[1878].\r\n\r\nYour kind note and specimens have been forwarded to me here, where I\r\nam staying at my son's house for a fortnight's complete rest, which\r\nI required from rather too hard work. For this reason I will not now\r\nexamine the seeds, but will wait till returning home, when, with my son\r\nFrancis' aid, I will look to them.\r\n\r\nI always felt, though without any good reason, rather sceptical about\r\nProf. Buckman's experiment, and I afterwards heard that a most wicked\r\nand cruel trick had been played on him by some of the agricultural\r\nstudents at Cirencester, who had sown seeds unknown to him in his\r\nexperimental beds. Whether he ever knew this I did not hear.\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly glad that you are willing to look into the Russian\r\nwheat case. It may turn out a mare's nest, but I have often incidentally\r\nobserved curious facts when making what I call \"a fool's experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 752. TO A. STEPHEN WILSON. Down, March 5th, 1879.\r\n\r\nI have just returned home after an absence of a week, and your letter\r\nwas not forwarded to me; I mention this to account for my apparent\r\ndiscourtesy in not having sooner thanked you. You have worked out\r\nthe subject with admirable care and clearness, and your drawings are\r\nbeautiful. I suspected that there was some error in the Russian belief,\r\nbut I did not think of the explanation which you have almost proved\r\nto be the true one. It is an extremely interesting instance of a more\r\nfertile variety beating out a less fertile one, and, in this case, one\r\nmuch more valuable to man. With respect to publication, I am at a\r\nloss to advise you, for I live a secluded life and do not see many\r\nperiodicals, or hear what is done at the various societies. It seems to\r\nme that your paper should be published in some agricultural journal; for\r\nit is not simply scientific, and would therefore not be published by the\r\nLinnean or Royal Societies.\r\n\r\nWould the Royal Agricultural Society be a fitting place? Unfortunately\r\nI am not a member, and could not myself present it. Unless you think\r\nof some better journal, there is the \"Agricultural Gazette\": I have\r\noccasionally suggested articles for publication to the editor (though\r\npersonally unknown to me) which he has always accepted.\r\n\r\nPermit me again to thank you for the thorough manner in which you have\r\nworked out this case; to kill an error is as good a service as, and\r\nsometimes even better than, the establishing a new truth or fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 753. TO A. STEPHEN WILSON. Down, February 13th, 1880.\r\n\r\nIt was very kind of you to send me two numbers of the \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle\" with your two articles, which I have read with much interest.\r\n(753/1. \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" 1879, page 652; 1880, pages 108, 173.)\r\nYou have quite convinced me, whatever Mr. Asher may say to the contrary.\r\nI want to ask you a question, on the bare chance of your being able to\r\nanswer it, but if you cannot, please do not take the trouble to write.\r\nThe lateral branches of the silver fir often grow out into knobs through\r\nthe action of a fungus, Aecidium; and from these knobs shoots grow\r\nvertically (753/2. The well-known \"Witches-Brooms,\" or \"Hexen-Besen,\"\r\nproduced by the fungus Aecidium elatinum.) instead of horizontally, like\r\nall the other twigs on the same branch. Now the roots of Cruciferae and\r\nprobably other plants are said to become knobbed through the action of\r\na fungus: now, do these knobs give rise to rootlets? and, if so, do they\r\ngrow in a new or abnormal direction? (753/3. The parasite is probably\r\nPlasmodiophora: in this case no abnormal rootlets have been observed, as\r\nfar as we know.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 754. TO W. THISELTON-DYER. Down, June 18th, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe plants arrived last night in first-rate order, and it was very very\r\ngood of you to take so much trouble as to hunt them up yourself. They\r\nseem exactly what I wanted, and if I fail it will not be for want of\r\nperfect materials. But a confounded painter (I beg his pardon) comes\r\nhere to-night, and for the next two days I shall be half dead with\r\nsitting to him; but after then I will begin to work at the plants and\r\nsee what I can do, and very curious I am about the results.\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for two very interesting letters. I am delighted\r\nto hear, and with surprise, that you care about old Erasmus D. God only\r\nknows what I shall make of his life--it is such new kind of work to me.\r\n(754/1. \"Erasmus Darwin.\" By Ernst Krause. Translated from the German by\r\nW.S. Dallas: with a preliminary notice by Charles Darwin. London, 1879.\r\nSee \"Life and Letters,\" III., pages 218-20.)\r\n\r\nThanks for case of sleeping Crotalaria--new to me. I quite agree to\r\nevery word you say about Ball's lecture (754/2. \"On the Origin of the\r\nFlora of the European Alps,\" \"Geogr. Soc. Proc.\" Volume I., 1879,\r\npage 564. See Letter 395, Volume II.)--it is, as you say, like Sir W.\r\nThomson's meteorite. (754/3. In 1871 Lord Kelvin (Presidential Address\r\nBrit. Assoc.) suggested that meteorites, \"the moss-grown fragments from\r\nthe ruins of another world,\" might have introduced life to our planet.)\r\nIt is really a pity; it is enough to make Geographical Distribution\r\nridiculous in the eyes of the world. Frank will be interested about the\r\nAuriculas; I never attended to this plant, for the powder did [not] seem\r\nto me like true \"bloom.\" (754/4. See Francis Darwin, on the relation\r\nbetween \"bloom\" on leaves and the distribution of the stomata. \"Linn.\r\nSoc. Journ.\" Volume XXII., page 114.) This subject, however, for the\r\npresent only, has gone to the dogs with me.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear of such a struggle for existence at Kew; but I have\r\noften wondered how it is that you are all not killed outright.\r\n\r\nI can most fully sympathise with you in your admiration of your little\r\ngirl. There is nothing so charming in this world, and we all in this\r\nhouse humbly adore our grandchild, and think his little pimple of a nose\r\nquite beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 755. TO G. BENTHAM. Down, February 16th, 1880.\r\n\r\nI have had real pleasure in signing Dyer's certificate. (755/1. As a\r\ncandidate for the Royal Society.) It was very kind in you to write to me\r\nabout the Orchideae, for it has pleased me to an extreme degree that I\r\ncould have been of the least use to you about the nature of the parts.\r\nThey are wonderful creatures, these orchids, and I sometimes think with\r\na glow of pleasure, when I remember making out some little point in\r\ntheir method of fertilisation. (755/2. Published in \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nIII., page 288.) With respect to terms, no doubt you will be able to\r\nimprove them greatly, for I knew nothing about the terms as used in\r\nother groups of plants. Could you not invent some quite new term for\r\ngland, implying viscidity? or append some word to gland. I used for\r\ncirripedes \"cement gland.\"\r\n\r\nYour present work must be frightfully difficult. I looked at a few dried\r\nflowers, and could make neither heads nor tails of them; and I well\r\nremember wondering what you would do with them when you came to the\r\ngroup in the \"Genera Plantarum.\" I heartily wish you safe through your\r\nwork,...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 756. TO F.M. BALFOUR. Down, September 4th, 1880.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will not think me a great bore, but I have this minute\r\nfinished reading your address at the British Association; and it has\r\ninterested me so much that I cannot resist thanking you heartily for the\r\npleasure derived from it, not to mention the honour which you have done\r\nme. (756/1. Presidential address delivered by Prof. F.M. Balfour before\r\nthe Biological Section at the British Association meeting at Swansea\r\n(1880).) The recent progress of embryology is indeed splendid. I have\r\nbeen very stupid not to have hitherto read your book, but I have had of\r\nlate no spare time; I have now ordered it, and your address will make\r\nit the more interesting to read, though I fear that my want of knowledge\r\nwill make parts unintelligible to me. (756/2. \"A Treatise on Comparative\r\nEmbryology,\" 2 volumes. London, 1880.) In my recent work on plants I\r\nhave been astonished to find to how many very different stimuli the\r\nsame small part--viz., the tip of the radicle--is sensitive, and has\r\nthe power of transmitting some influence to the adjoining part of\r\nthe radicle, exciting it to bend to or from the source of irritation\r\naccording to the needs of the plant (756/3. See Letter 757.); and all\r\nthis takes place without any nervous system! I think that such facts\r\nshould be kept in mind when speculating on the genesis of the nervous\r\nsystem. I always feel a malicious pleasure when a priori conclusions are\r\nknocked on the head: and therefore I felt somewhat like a devil when I\r\nread your remarks on Herbert Spencer (756/4. Prof. Balfour discussed\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer's views on the genesis of the nervous system, and\r\nexpressed the opinion that his hypothesis was not borne out by recent\r\ndiscoveries. \"The discovery that nerves have been developed from\r\nprocesses of epithelial cells gives a very different conception of their\r\ngenesis to that of Herbert Spencer, which makes them originate from\r\nthe passage of nervous impulses through a track of mingled colloids...\"\r\n(loc. cit., page 644.))...Our recent visit to Cambridge was a brilliant\r\nsuccess to us all, and will ever be remembered by me with much pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 757. TO JAMES PAGET.\r\n\r\n(757/1. During the closing years of his life, Darwin began to\r\nexperimentise on the possibility of producing galls artificially. A\r\nletter to Sir J.D. Hooker (November 3rd, 1880) shows the interest which\r\nhe felt in the question:--\r\n\r\n\"I was delighted with Paget's essay (757/2. An address on \"Elemental\r\nPathology,\" delivered before the British Medical Association, August\r\n1880, and published in the Journal of the Association.); I hear that\r\nhe has occasionally attended to this subject from his youth...I am very\r\nglad he has called attention to galls: this has always seemed to me a\r\nprofoundly interesting subject; and if I had been younger would take it\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nHis interest in this subject was connected with his ever-present wish\r\nto learn something of the causes of variation. He imagined to himself\r\nwonderful galls caused to appear on the ovaries of plants, and by these\r\nmeans he thought it possible that the seed might be influenced, and thus\r\nnew varieties arise. (757/3. There would have been great difficulties\r\nabout this line of research, for when the sexual organs of plants\r\nare deformed by parasites (in the way he hoped to effect by poisons)\r\nsterility almost always results. See Molliard's \"Les Cecidies Florales,\"\r\n\"Ann. Sci. Nat.\" 1895, Volume I., page 228.) He made a considerable\r\nnumber of experiments by injecting various reagents into the tissues of\r\nleaves, and with some slight indications of success. (757/4. The above\r\npassage is reprinted, with alterations, from \"Life and Letters,\" III.,\r\npage 346.)\r\n\r\nThe following letter to the late Sir James Paget refers to the same\r\nsubject.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 14th, 1880.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your essay, which has interested me greatly.\r\nWhat indomitable activity you have! It is a surprising thought that the\r\ndiseases of plants should illustrate human pathology. I have the German\r\n\"Encyclopaedia,\" and a few weeks ago told my son Francis that the\r\narticle on the diseases of plants would be well worth his study; but I\r\ndid not know it was written by Dr. Frank, for whom I entertain a high\r\nrespect as a first-rate observer and experimentiser, though for some\r\nunknown reason he has been a good deal snubbed in Germany. I can give\r\nyou one good case of regrowth in plants, recently often observed by me,\r\nthough only externally, as I do not know enough of histology to follow\r\nout details. It is the tip of the radicle of a germinating common bean.\r\nThe case is remarkable in some respects, for the tip is sensitive to\r\nvarious stimuli, and transmits an order, causing the upper part of\r\nthe radicle to bend. When the tip (for a length of about 1 mm.) is cut\r\ntransversely off, the radicle is not acted on by gravitation or other\r\nirritants, such as contact, etc., etc., but a new tip is regenerated\r\nin from two to four days, and then the radicle is again acted on by\r\ngravitation, and will bend to the centre of the earth. The tip of the\r\nradicle is a kind of brain to the whole growing part of the radicle!\r\n(757/5. We are indebted to Mr. Archer-Hind for the translation of the\r\nfollowing passage from Plato (\"Timaeus,\" 90A): \"The reason is every\r\nman's guardian genius (daimon), and has its habitation in our brain; it\r\nis this that raises man (who is a plant, not of earth but of heaven) to\r\nan erect posture, suspending the head and root of us from the heavens,\r\nwhich are the birthplace of our soul, and keeping all the body upright.\"\r\nOn the perceptions of plants, see \"Nature,\" November 14th, 1901--a\r\nlecture delivered at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association by\r\nFrancis Darwin. See also Bonitz, \"Index Aristotelicus,\" S.V. phuton.)\r\n\r\nMy observation will be published in about a week's time, and I would\r\nhave sent you the book, but I do not suppose that there is anything else\r\nin the book which would interest you. I am delighted that you have\r\ndrawn attention to galls. They have always seemed to me profoundly\r\ninteresting. Many years ago I began (but failed for want of time,\r\nstrength, and health, as on infinitely many other occasions) to\r\nexperimentise on plants, by injecting into their tissues some alkaloids\r\nand the poison of wasps, to see if I could make anything like galls.\r\nIf I remember rightly, in a few cases the tissues were thickened and\r\nhardened. I began these experiments because if by different poisons I\r\ncould have affected slightly and differently the tissues of the same\r\nplant, I thought there would be no insuperable difficulty in the fittest\r\npoisons being developed by insects so as to produce galls adapted for\r\nthem. Every character, as far as I can see, is apt to vary. Judging from\r\none of your sentences you will smile at this.\r\n\r\nTo any one believing in my pangenesis (if such a man exists) there does\r\nnot seem to me any extreme difficulty in understanding why plants have\r\nsuch little power of regeneration; for there is reason to think that\r\nmy imaginary gemmules have small power of passing from cell to cell.\r\n(757/6. On regeneration after injury, see Massart, \"La Cicatrisation\r\nchez les Vegetaux,\" in Volume 57 (1898) of the \"Memoires Couronnes,\"\r\npublished by the Royal Academy of Belgium. An account of the literature\r\nis given by the author.)\r\n\r\nForgive me for scribbling at such unreasonable length; but you are to\r\nblame for having interested me so much.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Perhaps you may remember that some two years ago you asked me to\r\nlunch with you, and proposed that I should offer myself again. Whenever\r\nI next come to London, I will do so, and thus have the pleasure of\r\nseeing you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 758. TO W. THISELTON-DYER.\r\n\r\n(758/1. \"The Power of Movement in Plants\" was published early in\r\nNovember, 1880. Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer, in writing to thank Darwin for\r\na copy of the book, had (November 20th) compared a structure in\r\nthe seedling Welwitschia with the \"peg\" of Cucurbita (see \"Power\r\nof Movement,\" page 102). Dyer wrote: \"One peculiar feature in the\r\ngerminating embryo is a lateral hypocotyledonary process, which\r\neventually serves as an absorbent organ, by which the nutriment of the\r\nendosperm is conveyed to the seedling. Such a structure was quite new to\r\nme, and Bower and I were disposed to see in it a representative of\r\nthe foot in Selaginella, when I saw the account of Flahault's 'peg.'\"\r\nFlahault, it should be explained, was the discoverer of the curious\r\npeg in Cucurbita. Prof. Bower wrote a paper (\"On the Germination and\r\nHistology of the seedling of Welwitschia mirabilis\" in the \"Quart.\r\nJourn. Microscop. Sci.\" XXI., 1881, page 15.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 28th [1880].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your most kind note, but you think too highly of\r\nour work--not but what this is very pleasant.\r\n\r\nI am deeply interested about Welwitschia. When at work on the pegs or\r\nprojections I could not imagine how they were first developed, before\r\nthey could have been of mere mechanical use. Now it seems possible that\r\na circle between radicle and hypocotyl may be permeable to fluids, and\r\nthus have given rise to projections so as to expose larger surface.\r\nCould you test Welwitschia with permanganate of potassium: if, like my\r\npegs, the lower surface would be coloured brown like radicle, and upper\r\nsurface left white like hypocotyl. If such an idea as yours, of an\r\nabsorbing organ, had ever crossed my mind, I would have tried many\r\nhypocotyls in weak citrate of ammonia, to see if it penetrated on line\r\nof junction more easily than elsewhere. I daresay the projection in\r\nAbronia and Mirabilis may be an absorbent organ. It was very good fun\r\nbothering the seeds of Cucurbita by planting them edgeways, as would\r\nnever naturally occur, and then the peg could not act properly. Many of\r\nthe Germans are very contemptuous about making out use of organs; but\r\nthey may sneer the souls out of their bodies, and I for one shall think\r\nit the most interesting part of natural history. Indeed, you are greatly\r\nmistaken if you doubt for one moment on the very great value of your\r\nconstant and most kind assistance to us. I have not seen the pamphlet,\r\nand shall be very glad to keep it. Frank, when he comes home, will\r\nbe much interested and pleased with your letter. Pray give my kindest\r\nremembrance to Mrs. Dyer.\r\n\r\nThis is a very untidy note, but I am very tired with dissecting worms\r\nall day. Read the last chapter of our book, and then you will know the\r\nwhole contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 759. TO H. VOCHTING. Down, December 16th, 1880.\r\n\r\nAbsence from home has prevented me from sooner thanking you for your\r\nkind present of your several publications. I procured some time ago your\r\n\"Organbilding\" (759/1. \"Organbildung im Pflanzenreich,\" 1878.) etc., but\r\nit was too late for me to profit by it for my book, as I was correcting\r\nthe press. I read only parts, but my son Francis read the whole with\r\ncare and told me much about it, which greatly interested me. I also read\r\nyour article in the \"Bot. Zeitung.\" My son began at once experimenting,\r\nto test your views, and this very night will read a paper before the\r\nLinnean Society on the roots of Rubus (759/2. Francis Darwin, \"The\r\nTheory of the Growth of Cuttings\" (\"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" XVIII.). [I take\r\nthis opportunity of expressing my regret that at page 417, owing to\r\nneglect of part of Vochting's facts, I made a criticism of his argument\r\nwhich cannot be upheld.--F.D.].), and I think that you will be pleased\r\nto find how well his conclusions agree with yours. He will of course\r\nsend you a copy of his paper when it is printed. I have sent him your\r\nletter, which will please him if he agrees with me; for your letter has\r\ngiven me real pleasure, and I did not at all know what the many great\r\nphysiologists of Germany, Switzerland, and Holland would think of it\r\n[\"The Power of Movement,\" etc.]. I was quite sorry to read Sachs' views\r\nabout root-forming matter, etc., for I have an unbounded admiration for\r\nSachs. In this country we are dreadfully behind in Physiological Botany.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 760. TO A. DE CANDOLLE. Down, January 24th, 1881.\r\n\r\nIt was extremely kind of you to write me so long and valuable a\r\nletter, the whole of which deserves careful consideration. I have been\r\nparticularly pleased at what you say about the new terms used, because I\r\nhave often been annoyed at the multitude of new terms lately invented in\r\nall branches of Biology in Germany; and I doubted much whether I was not\r\nquite as great a sinner as those whom I have blamed. When I read your\r\nremarks on the word \"purpose\" in your \"Phytographie,\" I vowed that I\r\nwould not use it again; but it is not easy to cure oneself of a vicious\r\nhabit. It is also difficult for any one who tries to make out the use of\r\na structure to avoid the word purpose. I see that I have probably gone\r\nbeyond my depth in discussing plurifoliate and unifoliate leaves; but\r\nin such a case as that of Mimosa albida, where rudiments of additional\r\nleaflets are present, we must believe that they were well developed in\r\nthe progenitor of the plant. So again, when the first true leaf differs\r\nwidely in shape from the older leaves, and resembles the older leaves in\r\nallied species, is it not the most simple explanation that such leaves\r\nhave retained their ancient character, as in the case of the embryos of\r\nso many animals?\r\n\r\nYour suggestion of examining the movements of vertical leaves with an\r\nequal number of stomata on both sides, with reference to the light,\r\nseems to me an excellent one, and I hope that my son Francis may follow\r\nit up. But I will not trouble you with any more remarks about our book.\r\nMy son will write to you about the diagram.\r\n\r\nLet me add that I shall ever remember with pleasure your visit here last\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 761. TO J. LUBBOCK (Lord Avebury). Down, April 16th [1881].\r\n\r\nWill you be so kind as to send and lend me the Desmodium gyrans by the\r\nbearer who brings this note.\r\n\r\nShortly after you left I found my notice of the seeds in the \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle,\" which please return hereafter, as I have no other copy.\r\n(761/1. \"Note on the Achenia of Pumilio argyrolepis.\" \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle,\" 1861, page 4.) I do not think that I made enough about the\r\ngreat power of absorption of water by the corolla-like calyx or pappus.\r\nIt seems to me not unlikely that the pappus of other Compositae may be\r\nserviceable to the seeds, whilst lying on the ground, by absorbing the\r\ndew which would be especially apt to condense on the fine points and\r\nfilaments of the pappus. Anyhow, this is a point which might be easily\r\ninvestigated. Seeds of Tussilago, or groundsel (761/2. It is not clear\r\nwhether Tussilago or groundsel (Senecio vulgaris) is meant; or whether\r\nhe was not sure which of the two plants becomes slimy when wetted.),\r\nemit worm-like masses of mucus, and it would be curious to ascertain\r\nwhether wetting the pappus alone would suffice to cause such secretion.\r\n(761/3. See Letter 707.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 762. TO G.J. ROMANES. Down, April 18th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad of your success with the flashing light. (762/1.\r\nRomanes' paper on the effect of intermittent light on heliotropism was\r\nthe \"Proc. Royal Soc.\" Volume LIV., page 333.) If plants are acted on by\r\nlight, like some of the lower animals, there is an additional point of\r\ninterest, as it seems to me, in your results. Most botanists believe\r\nthat light causes a plant to bend to it in as direct a manner as light\r\naffects nitrate of silver. I believe that it merely tells the plant to\r\nwhich side to bend, and I see indications of this belief prevailing even\r\nwith Sachs. Now it might be expected that light would act on a plant in\r\nsomething the same manner as on the lower animals. As you are at work on\r\nthis subject, I will call your attention to another point. Wiesner, of\r\nVienna (who has lately published a great book on heliotropism) finds\r\nthat an intermittent light, say of 20 minutes, produces the same\r\neffect as a continuous light of, say 60 m. (762/2. Wiesner's papers on\r\nheliotropism are in the \"Denkschriften\" of the Vienna Academy, Volumes\r\n39 and 43.) So that Van Tieghem, in the first part of his book which has\r\njust appeared, remarks, the light during 40 m. out of the 60 m. produced\r\nno effect. I observed an analogous case described in my book. (762/3.\r\n\"Power of Movement,\" page 459.)\r\n\r\nWiesner and Van Tieghem seem to think that this is explained by\r\ncalling the whole process \"induction,\" borrowing a term used by some\r\nphysico-chemists (of whom I believe Roscoe is one) and implying an\r\nagency which does not produce any effect for some time, and continues\r\nits effect for some time after the cause has ceased. I believe that\r\nphotographic paper is an instance. I must ask Leonard (762/4. Mr.\r\nDarwin's son.) whether an interrupted light acts on it in the same\r\nmanner as on a plant. At present I must still believe in my explanation\r\nthat it is the contrast between light and darkness which excites a\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nI have forgotten my main object in writing--viz., to say that I believe\r\n(and have so stated) that seedlings vary much in their sensitiveness\r\nto light; but I did not prove this, for there are many difficulties,\r\nwhether the time of incipient curvature or the amount of curvature is\r\ntaken as the criterion. Moreover they vary according to age, and\r\nperhaps from vigour of growth, and there seems inherent variability,\r\nas Strasburger (whom I quote) found with spores. If the curious anomaly\r\nobserved by you is due to varying sensitiveness, ought not all the\r\nseedlings to bend if the flashes were at longer intervals of time?\r\nAccording to my notion of contrast between light and darkness being the\r\nstimulus, I should expect that if flashes were made sufficiently slow\r\nit would be a powerful stimulus, and that you would suddenly arrive at\r\na period when the result would SUDDENLY become great. On the other hand,\r\nas far as my experience goes, what one expects rarely happens.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 763. TO JULIUS WIESNER. Down, October 4th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your very kind letter, and for the present of\r\nyour new work. (763/1. \"Das Bewegungsvermogen der Pflanze,\" 1881. One of\r\nus has given some account of Wiesner's book in the presidential address\r\nto Section D of the British Association, 1891. Wiesner's divergence\r\nfrom Darwin's views is far-reaching, and includes the main thesis of\r\nthe \"Power of Movement.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 336, for an\r\ninteresting letter to Wiesner.) My son Francis, if he had been at home,\r\nwould have likewise sent his thanks. I will immediately begin to read\r\nyour book, and when I have finished it will write again. But I read\r\ngerman so very slowly that your book will take me a considerable time,\r\nfor I cannot read for more than half an hour each day. I have, also,\r\nbeen working too hard lately, and with very little success, so that I am\r\ngoing to leave home for a time and try to forget science.\r\n\r\nI quite expect that you will find some gross errors in my work, for you\r\nare a very much more skilful and profound experimentalist than I am.\r\nAlthough I always am endeavouring to be cautious and to mistrust myself,\r\nyet I know well how apt I am to make blunders. Physiology, both animal\r\nand vegetable, is so difficult a subject, that it seems to me to\r\nprogress chiefly by the elimination or correction of ever-recurring\r\nmistakes. I hope that you will not have upset my fundamental notion\r\nthat various classes of movement result from the modification of a\r\nuniversally present movement of circumnutation.\r\n\r\nI am very glad that you will again discuss the view of the turgescence\r\nof the cells being the cause of the movement of parts. I adopted De\r\nVries' views as seeming to me the most probable, but of late I have felt\r\nmore doubts on this head. (763/2. See \"Power of Movement,\" page 2. De\r\nVries' work is published in the \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1879, page 830.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 764. TO J.D. HOOKER. Glenrhydding House, Patterdale, Penrith,\r\nJune 15th, 1881.\r\n\r\nIt was real pleasure to me to see once again your well-known handwriting\r\non the outside of your note. I do not know how long you have returned\r\nfrom Italy, but I am very sorry that you are so bothered already with\r\nwork and visits. I cannot but think that you are too kind and civil\r\nto visitors, and too conscientious about your official work. But a man\r\ncannot cure his virtues, any more than his vices, after early youth;\r\nso you must bear your burthen. It is, however, a great misfortune for\r\nscience that you have so very little spare time for the \"Genera.\" I can\r\nwell believe what an awful job the palms must be. Even their size must\r\nbe very inconvenient. You and Bentham must hate the monocotyledons, for\r\nwhat work the Orchideae must have been, and Gramineae and Cyperaceae\r\nwill be. I am rather despondent about myself, and my troubles are of an\r\nexactly opposite nature to yours, for idleness is downright misery to\r\nme, as I find here, as I cannot forget my discomfort for an hour. I have\r\nnot the heart or strength at my age to begin any investigation lasting\r\nyears, which is the only thing which I enjoy; and I have no little jobs\r\nwhich I can do. So I must look forward to Down graveyard as the sweetest\r\nplace on earth. This place is magnificently beautiful, and I enjoy the\r\nscenery, though weary of it; and the weather has been very cold and\r\nalmost always hazy.\r\n\r\nI am so glad that your tour has answered for Lady Hooker. We return home\r\non the first week of July, and should be truly glad to aid Lady Hooker\r\nin any possible manner which she will suggest.\r\n\r\nI have written to my gardener to send you plants of Oxalis corniculata\r\n(and seeds if possible). I should think so common a weed was never asked\r\nfor before,--and what a poor return for the hundreds of plants which I\r\nhave received from Kew! I hope that I have not bothered you by writing\r\nso long a note, and I did not intend to do so.\r\n\r\nIf Asa Gray has returned with you, please give him my kindest\r\nremembrances.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 765. TO J.D. HOOKER. October 22nd, 1881.\r\n\r\nI am investigating the action of carbonate of ammonia on chlorophyll,\r\nwhich makes me want the plants in my list. (765/1. \"The Action of\r\nCarbonate of Ammonia on Chlorophyll Bodies.\" \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" XIX.,\r\npage 262, 1882.) I have incidentally observed one point in Euphorbia,\r\nwhich has astonished me--viz. that in the fine fibrous roots of\r\nEuphorbia, the alternate rows of cells in their roots must differ\r\nphysiologically, though not in external appearance, as their contents\r\nafter the action of carbonate of ammonia differ most conspicuously...\r\n\r\nWiesner of Vienna has just published a book vivisecting me in the most\r\ncourteous, but awful manner, about the \"Power of Movement in Plants.\"\r\n(765/2. See Letter 763, note.) Thank heaven, he admits almost all my\r\nfacts, after re-trying all my experiments; but gives widely different\r\ninterpretation of the facts. I think he proves me wrong in several\r\ncases, but I am convinced that he is utterly erroneous and fanciful\r\nin other explanations. No man was ever vivisected in so sweet a manner\r\nbefore, as I am in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.XII.\r\n\r\nVIVISECTION AND MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS, 1867-1882.\r\n\r\n2.XII.I. VIVISECTION, 1875-1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 766. TO LORD PLAYFAIR.\r\n\r\n(766/1. A Bill was introduced to the House of Commons by Messrs. Lyon\r\nPlayfair, Walpole and Ashley, in the spring of 1875, but was withdrawn\r\non the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole\r\nquestion. Some account of the Anti-Vivisection agitation, the\r\nintroduction of bills, and the appointment of a Royal Commission\r\nis given in the \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 201, where the more\r\ninteresting of Darwin's letters on the question are published.)\r\n\r\nDown, May 26th, 1875.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will excuse my troubling you once again. I received some\r\ndays ago a letter from Prof. Huxley, in Edinburgh, who says with respect\r\nto your Bill: \"the professors here are all in arms about it, and as the\r\npapers have associated my name with the Bill, I shall have to repudiate\r\nit publicly, unless something can be done. But what in the world is to\r\nbe done?\" (766/2. The letter is published in full in Mr. L. Huxley's\r\ninteresting chapter on the vivisection question in his father's \"Life,\"\r\nI., page 438.) Dr. Burdon Sanderson is in nearly the same frame of mind\r\nabout it. The newspapers take different views of the purport of\r\nthe Bill, but it seems generally supposed that it would prevent\r\ndemonstrations on animals rendered insensible, and this seems to me\r\na monstrous provision. It would, moreover, probably defeat the end\r\ndesired; for Dr. B. Sanderson, who demonstrates to his class on animals\r\nrendered insensible, told me that some of his students had declared\r\nto him that unless he had shown them what he had, they would have\r\nexperimented on live animals for themselves. Certainly I do not believe\r\nthat any one could thoroughly understand the action of the heart without\r\nhaving seen it in action. I do not doubt that you wish to aid the\r\nprogress of Physiology, and at the same time save animals from all\r\nuseless suffering; and in this case I believe that you could not do\r\na greater service than to warn the Home Secretary with respect to the\r\nappointment of Royal Commissioners, that ordinary doctors know little or\r\nnothing about Physiology as a science, and are incompetent to judge of\r\nits high importance and of the probability of its hereafter conferring\r\ngreat benefits on mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 767. TO LORD PLAYFAIR. Down, May 28th.\r\n\r\nI must write one line to thank you for your very kind letter, and to say\r\nthat, after despatching my last note, it suddenly occurred to me that I\r\nhad been rude in calling one of the provisions of your Bill \"monstrous\"\r\nor \"absurd\"--I forget which. But when I wrote the expression it was\r\naddressed to the bigots who, I believed, had forced you to a compromise.\r\nI cannot understand what Dr. B. Sanderson could have been about not to\r\nhave objected with respect to the clause of not demonstrating on animals\r\nrendered insensible. I am extremely sorry that you have had trouble and\r\nvexation on the subject. It is a most disagreeable and difficult one. I\r\nam not personally concerned, as I never tried an experiment on a living\r\nanimal, nor am I a physiologist; but I know enough to see how ruinous\r\nit would be to stop all progress in so grand a science as Physiology. I\r\ncommenced the agitation amongst the physiologists for this reason,\r\nand because I have long felt very keenly on the question of useless\r\nvivisection, and believed, though without any good evidence, that there\r\nwas not always, even in this country, care enough taken. Pray forgive me\r\nthis note, so much about myself...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 768. TO G.J. ROMANES.\r\n\r\n(768/1. Published in \"Life of Romanes,\" page 61, under 1876-77.)\r\n\r\nDown, June 4th [1876].\r\n\r\nYour letter has made me as proud and conceited as ten peacocks. (768/2.\r\nThis may perhaps refer to Darwin being elected the only honorary member\r\nof the Physiological Society, a fact that was announced in a letter from\r\nRomanes June 1st, 1876, published in the \"Life\" of Romanes, page 50.\r\nDr. Sharpey was subsequently elected a second honorary member.) I am\r\ninclined to think that writing against the bigots about vivisection is\r\nas hopeless as stemming a torrent with a reed. Frank, who has just\r\ncome here, and who sputters with indignation on the subject, takes an\r\nopposite line, and perhaps he is right; anyhow, he had the best of an\r\nargument with me on the subject...It seems to me the physiologists are\r\nnow in the position of a persecuted religious sect, and they must grin\r\nand bear the persecution, however cruel and unjust, as well as they can.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 769. TO T. LAUDER BRUNTON.\r\n\r\n(769/1. In November, 1881, an absolutely groundless charge was brought\r\nby the Victoria Street Society for the Protection of Animals from\r\nVivisection against Dr. Ferrier for an infringement of the Vivisection\r\nAct. The experiment complained of was the removal of the brain of a\r\nmonkey and the subsequent testing of the animal's powers of reacting to\r\ncertain treatment. The fact that the operation had been performed six\r\nmonths before the case came into court would alone have been fatal to\r\nthe prosecution. Moreover, it was not performed by Dr. Ferrier, but\r\nby another observer, who was licensed under the Act to keep the monkey\r\nalive after the operation, which was performed under anaesthetics.\r\nThus the prosecution completely broke down, and the case was dismissed.\r\n(769/2. From the \"British Medical Journal,\" November 19th, 1881. See\r\nalso \"Times,\" November 18th, 1881.) The sympathy with Dr. Ferrier in\r\nthe purely scientific and medical world was very strong, and the British\r\nMedical Association undertook the defence. The prosecution did good in\r\none respect, inasmuch as it led to the formation of the Science Defence\r\nAssociation, to which reference is made in some of Mr. Darwin's letters\r\nto Sir Lauder Brunton. The Association still exists, and continues to do\r\ngood work.\r\n\r\nPart of the following letter was published in the \"British Medical\r\nJournal,\" December 3rd, 1881.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 19th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI saw in some paper that there would probably be a subscription to pay\r\nDr. Ferrier's legal expenses in the late absurd and wicked prosecution.\r\nAs I live so retired I might not hear of the subscription, and I should\r\nregret beyond measure not to have the pleasure and honour of showing my\r\nsympathy [with] and admiration of Dr. Ferrier's researches. I know that\r\nyou are his friend, as I once met him at your house; so I earnestly beg\r\nyou to let me hear if there is any means of subscribing, as I should\r\nmuch like to be an early subscriber. I am sure that you will forgive me\r\nfor troubling you under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I finished reading a few days ago the several physiological and\r\nmedical papers which you were so kind as to send me. (769/3. Some of\r\nLauder Brunton's publications.) I was much interested by several of\r\nthem, especially by that on night-sweating, and almost more by others on\r\ndigestion. I have seldom been made to realise more vividly the wondrous\r\ncomplexity of our whole system. How any one of us keeps alive for a day\r\nis a marvel!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 770. T. LAUDER BRUNTON TO CHARLES DARWIN. 50, Welbeck Street,\r\nLondon, November 21st, 1881.\r\n\r\nI thank you most sincerely for your kind letter and your offer of\r\nassistance to Dr. Ferrier. There is at present no subscription list, as\r\nthe British Medical Association have taken up the case, and ought to\r\npay the expenses. Should these make such a call upon the funds of the\r\nAssociation as to interfere with its other objects, the whole or part\r\nof the expenses will be paid by those who have subscribed to a guarantee\r\nfund. To this fund there are already a number of subscribers, whose\r\nnames are taken by Professor Gerald Yeo, one of the secretaries of the\r\nPhysiological Society. They have not subscribed a definite sum, but have\r\nsimply fixed a maximum which they will subscribe, if necessary, on the\r\nunderstanding that only so much as is required shall be asked from each\r\nsubscriber in proportion to his subscription. It is proposed to send\r\nby-and-by a list of the most prominent members of this guarantee fund\r\nto the \"Times\" and other papers, and not only every scientific man, but\r\nevery member of the medical profession, will rejoice to see your name\r\nin the list. Dr. Ferrier has been quite worn out by the worry of this\r\nprosecution, or, as it might well be called, persecution, and has gone\r\ndown to Shanklin for a couple of days. He returns this afternoon, and I\r\nhave sent on your letter to await his arrival, knowing as I do that it\r\nwill be to him like cold water to a thirsty soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 771. TO T. LAUDER BRUNTON. Down, November 22nd, 1881.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your very kind and interesting letter...\r\n\r\nI write now to beg a favour. I do not in the least know what others\r\nhave guaranteed in relation to Dr. Ferrier. (771/1. In a letter dated\r\nNovember 27th, 1881, Sir Lauder Brunton wrote in reply to Mr. Darwin's\r\ninquiry as to the amount of the subscriptions: \"When I ascertain\r\nwhat they intend to give under the new conditions--viz., that the\r\nsubscriptions are not to be applied to Ferrier's defence, but to the\r\ndefence of others who may be attacked and to a diffusion of knowledge\r\nregarding the nature and purposes of vivisection, I will let you\r\nknow...\") Would twenty guineas be sufficient? If not, will you kindly\r\ntake the trouble to have my name put down for thirty or forty guineas,\r\nas you may think best. If, on the other hand, no one else has guaranteed\r\nfor as much as twenty guineas, will you put me down for ten or fifteen\r\nguineas, though I should like to give twenty best.\r\n\r\nYou can understand that I do not wish to be conspicuous either by too\r\nlittle or too much; so I beg you to be so very kind as to act for me. I\r\nhave a multitude of letters which I must answer, so excuse haste.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 772. TO T. LAUDER BRUNTON.\r\n\r\n(772/1. The following letter was written in reply to Sir T. Lauder\r\nBrunton's suggestion that Mr. Darwin should be proposed as President of\r\nthe Science Defence Association.)\r\n\r\n4, Bryanston Street, Portman Square, December 17th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking a good deal about the suggestion which you made\r\nto me the other day, on the supposition that you could not get some man\r\nlike the President of the College of Physicians to accept the office. My\r\nwife is strongly opposed to my accepting the office, as she feels sure\r\nthat the anxiety thus caused would tell heavily on my health. But\r\nthere is a much stronger objection suggested to me by one of my\r\nrelations--namely, no man ought to allow himself to be placed at the\r\nhead (though only nominally so) of an associated movement, unless he\r\nhas the means of judging of the acts performed by the association, after\r\nhearing each point discussed. This occurred to me when you spoke to\r\nme, and I think that I said something to this effect. Anyhow, I have in\r\nseveral analogous cases acted on this principle.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, any preliminary statement which the Association may\r\npublish. I might feel grave doubts about the wisdom or justice of some\r\npoints, and this solely from my not having heard them discussed. I am\r\ntherefore inclined to think that it would not be right in me to accept\r\nthe nominal Presidency of your Association, and thus have to act\r\nblindly.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can at present see, I fear that I must confine my assistance\r\nto subscribing as large a sum to the Association as any member gives.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to trouble you, but I have thought it best to tell you at\r\nonce of the doubts which have arisen in my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 773. TO LAUDER BRUNTON.\r\n\r\n(773/1. Sir T. Lauder Brunton had written (February 12th) to Mr. Darwin\r\nexplaining that two opinions were held as to the constitution of the\r\nproposed Science Defence Association: one that it should consist of\r\na small number of representative men; the other that it should, if\r\npossible, embrace every medical practitioner in the country. Sir Lauder\r\nBrunton adds: \"I should be very greatly obliged if you would kindly say\r\nwhat you think of the two schemes.\")\r\n\r\nDown, February 14th, 1882.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your information in regard to the\r\nAssociation, about which I feel a great interest. It seems to me highly\r\ndesirable that the Association should include as many medical and\r\nscientific men as possible throughout the whole country, who could\r\nillumine those capable of illumination on the necessity of physiological\r\nresearch; but that the Association should be governed by a council of\r\npowerful men, not too many in number. Such a council, as representing\r\na large body of medical men, would have more power in the eyes of\r\nvote-hunting politicians than a small body representing only themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom what I see of country practitioners, I think that their annual\r\nsubscription ought to be very small. But would it not be possible to\r\nadd to the rules some such statement as the following one: \"That by a\r\ndonation of... pounds, or of any larger sum, from those who feel a deep\r\ninterest in the progress of medical science, the donor shall become a\r\nlife member.\" I, for one, would gladly subscribe 50 or 100 pounds. If\r\nsuch a plan were approved by the leading medical men of London, two or\r\nthree thousand pounds might at once be collected; and if any such\r\nsum could be announced as already subscribed, when the program of the\r\nAssociation is put forth, it would have, as I believe, a considerable\r\ninfluence on the country, and would attract the attention of country\r\npractitioners. The Anti-Corn Law League owed much of its enormous power\r\nto several wealthy men laying down 1,000 pounds; for the subscription of\r\na good sum of money is the best proof of earnest conviction. You asked\r\nfor my opinion on the above points, and I have given it freely, though\r\nwell aware that from living so retired a life my judgment cannot be\r\nworth much.\r\n\r\nHave you read Mr. Gurney's articles in the \"Fortnightly\" and \"Cornhill?\"\r\n(773/2. \"Fortnightly Review,\" XXX., page 778; \"Cornhill Magazine,\" XLV.,\r\npage 191. The articles are by the late Edmund Gurney, author of \"The\r\npower of Sound,\" 1880.) They seem to me very clever, though obscurely\r\nwritten; and I agree with almost everything he says, except with some\r\npassages which appear to imply that no experiments should be tried\r\nunless some immediate good can be predicted, and this is a gigantic\r\nmistake contradicted by the whole history of science.\r\n\r\nP.S.--That is a curious fact about babies. I remember hearing on good\r\nauthority that very young babies when moved are apt to clutch hold of\r\nanything, and I thought of your explanation; but your case during sleep\r\nis a much more interesting one. Very many thanks for the book, which I\r\nmuch wanted to see; it shall be sent back to-day, as from you, to the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.XII.II. MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS, 1867-1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 774. TO CANON FARRAR.\r\n\r\n(774/1. The lecture which forms the subject of this letter was one\r\ndelivered by Canon Farrar at the Royal Institution, \"On Some Defects in\r\nPublic School Education.\")\r\n\r\nDown, March 5th, 1867.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your kind present of your lecture. We have\r\nread it aloud with the greatest interest, and I agree to every word. I\r\nadmire your candour and wonderful freedom from prejudice; for I feel an\r\ninward conviction that if I had been a great classical scholar I should\r\nnever have been able to have judged fairly on the subject. As it is, I\r\nam one of the root and branch men, and would leave classics to be learnt\r\nby those alone who have sufficient zeal and the high taste requisite\r\nfor their appreciation. You have indeed done a great public service in\r\nspeaking out so boldly. Scientific men might rail forever, and it would\r\nonly be said that they railed at what they did not understand. I was\r\nat school at Shrewsbury under a great scholar, Dr. Butler; I\r\nlearnt absolutely nothing, except by amusing myself by reading and\r\nexperimenting in chemistry. Dr. Butler somehow found this out, and\r\npublicly sneered at me before the whole school for such gross waste of\r\ntime; I remember he called me a Pococurante (774/2. Told in \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" I., page 35.), which, not understanding, I thought was a\r\ndreadful name. I wish you had shown in your lecture how science could\r\npractically be taught in a great school; I have often heard it objected\r\nthat this could not be done, and I never knew what to say in answer.\r\n\r\nI heartily hope that you may live to see your zeal and labour produce\r\ngood fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 775. TO HERBERT SPENCER. Down, December 9th [1867].\r\n\r\nI thank you very sincerely for your kind present of your \"First\r\nPrinciples.\" (775/1. \"This must have been the second edition.\" (Note by\r\nMr. Spencer.)) I earnestly hope that before long I may have strength to\r\nstudy the work as it ought to be studied, for I am certain to find\r\nor re-find much that is deeply interesting. In many parts of your\r\n\"Principles of Biology\" I was fairly astonished at the prodigality of\r\nyour original views. (775/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., pages 55,\r\n56.) Most of the chapters furnished suggestions for whole volumes of\r\nfuture researches. As I have heard that you have changed your residence,\r\nI am forced to address this to Messrs. Williams & Norgate; and for the\r\nsame reason I gave some time ago the same address to Mr. Murray for a\r\ncopy of my book on variation, etc., which is now finished, but delayed\r\nby the index-maker.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 776. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(776/1. This letter refers to a movement set on foot at a meeting held\r\nat the Freemasons' Tavern, on November 16th, 1872, of which an account\r\nis given in the \"Times\" of November 23rd, 1872, at which Mark Pattison,\r\nMr. Henry Sidgwick, Sir Benjamin Brodie, Professors Rolleston, Seeley,\r\nHuxley, etc., were present. The \"Times\" says that the meeting was held\r\n\"by members of the Universities and others interested in the promotion\r\nof mature study and scientific research in England.\" One of the\r\nheadings of the \"Program of Discussion\" was \"The Abolition of Prize\r\nFellowships.\")\r\n\r\nSevenoaks, October 22nd [1872].\r\n\r\nI have been glad to sign and forward the paper, for I have very long\r\nthought it a sin that the immense funds of the Universities should be\r\nwasted in Fellowships, except a few for paying for education. But when\r\nI was at Cambridge it would have been an unjustifiable sneer to have\r\nspoken of the place as one for education, always excepting the men who\r\nwent in for honours. You speak of another resolution \"in the interest\r\nof the anti-letter-writing association\"--but alas, this never arrived!\r\nI should like a society formed so that every one might receive pleasant\r\nletters and never answer them.\r\n\r\nWe return home on Saturday, after three weeks of the most astounding\r\ndullness, doing nothing and thinking of nothing. I hope my Brain likes\r\nit--as for myself, it is dreadful doing nothing. (776/2. Darwin returned\r\nto Down from Sevenoaks on Saturday, October 26th, 1872, which fixes the\r\ndate of the letter.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 777. TO LADY DERBY. Down, Saturday [1874?].\r\n\r\nIf you had called here after I had read the article you would have found\r\na much perplexed man. (777/1. Probably Sir W. Crookes' \"Researches in\r\nthe Phenomena of Spiritualism\" (reprinted from the \"Quarterly Journal of\r\nScience\"), London, 1874. Other papers by Crookes are in the \"Proceedings\r\nof the Society for Psychical Research.\") I cannot disbelieve Mr.\r\nCrooke's statement, nor can I believe in his result. It has removed\r\nsome of my difficulty that the supposed power is not an anomaly, but is\r\ncommon in a lesser degree to various persons. It is also a consolation\r\nto reflect that gravity acts at any distance, in some wholly unknown\r\nmanner, and so may nerve-force. Nothing is so difficult to decide as\r\nwhere to draw a just line between scepticism and credulity. It was\r\na very long time before scientific men would believe in the fall of\r\naerolites; and this was chiefly owing to so much bad evidence, as in the\r\npresent case, being mixed up with the good. All sorts of objects were\r\nsaid to have been seen falling from the sky. I very much hope that a\r\nnumber of men, such as Professor Stokes, will be induced to witness Mr.\r\nCrooke's experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n(778/1. The two following extracts may be given in further illustration\r\nof Darwin's guiding principle in weighing evidence. He wrote to Robert\r\nChambers, April 30th, 1861: \"Thanks also for extract out of newspaper\r\nabout rooks and crows; I wish I dared trust it. I see in cutting the\r\npages [of Chambers' book, \"Ice and Water\"]...that you fulminate against\r\nthe scepticism of scientific men. You would not fulminate quite so much\r\nif you had had so many wild-goose chases after facts stated by men\r\nnot trained to scientific accuracy. I often vow to myself that I will\r\nutterly disregard every statement made by any one who has not shown the\r\nworld he can observe accurately.\" In a letter to Dr. Dohrn, of Naples,\r\nJanuary 4th, 1870, Darwin wrote: \"Forgive me for suggesting one\r\ncaution; as Demosthenes said, 'Action, action, action,' was the soul of\r\neloquence, so is caution almost the soul of science.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 778. TO J. BURDON SANDERSON. Down, July 16th, 1875.\r\n\r\nSome little time ago Mr. Simon (778/1. Now Sir John Simon) sent me the\r\nlast Report, and your statements about contagion deeply interested me.\r\nBy the way, if you see Mr. Simon, and can remember it, will you thank\r\nhim for me; I was so busy at the time that I did not write. Having been\r\nin correspondence with Paget lately on another subject, I mentioned to\r\nhim an analogy which has struck me much, now that we know that sheep-pox\r\nis fungoid; and this analogy pleased him. It is that of fairy rings,\r\nwhich are believed to spread from a centre, and when they intersect the\r\nintersecting portion dies out, as the mycelium cannot grow where it has\r\ngrown during previous years. So, again, I have never seen a ring within\r\na ring; this seems to me a parallel case to a man commonly having the\r\nsmallpox only once. I imagine that in both cases the mycelium must\r\nconsume all the matter on which it can subsist.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 779. TO A. GAPITCHE.\r\n\r\n(779/1. The following letter was written to the author (under the\r\npseudonym of Gapitche) of a pamphlet entitled \"Quelques mots sur\r\nl'Eternite du Corps Humaine\" (Nice, 1880). Mr. Gapitche's idea was\r\nthat man might, by perfect adaptation to his surroundings, indefinitely\r\nprolong the duration of life. We owe Mr. Darwin's letter to the kindness\r\nof Herr Vetter, editor of the well-known journal \"Kosmos.\")\r\n\r\nDown, February 24th, 1880.\r\n\r\nI suppose that no one can prove that death is inevitable, but the\r\nevidence in favour of this belief is overwhelmingly strong from the\r\nevidence of all other living creatures. I do not believe that it is by\r\nany means invariably true that the higher organisms always live longer\r\nthan the lower ones. Elephants, parrots, ravens, tortoises, and some\r\nfish live longer than man. As evolution depends on a long succession of\r\ngenerations, which implies death, it seems to me in the highest degree\r\nimprobable that man should cease to follow the general law of evolution,\r\nand this would follow if he were to be immortal.\r\n\r\nThis is all that I can say.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 780. TO J. POPPER.\r\n\r\n(780/1. Mr. Popper had written about a proposed flying machine in which\r\nbirds were to take a part.)\r\n\r\nDown, February 15th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that I cannot give you the least aid, as I have never\r\nattended to any mechanical subjects. I should doubt whether it would be\r\npossible to train birds to fly in a certain direction in a body, though\r\nI am aware that they have been taught some tricks. Their mental powers\r\nare probably much below those of mammals. It is said, and I suppose\r\ntruly, that an eagle will carry a lamb. This shows that a bird may have\r\ngreat power for a short distance. I cannot remember your essay with\r\nsufficient distinctness to make any remarks on it. When a man is old and\r\nworks hard, one subject drives another out of his head.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 781. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Worthing, September 9th, 1881.\r\n\r\n(781/1. Mr. Anthony Rich left his house at Worthing as a legacy to Mr.\r\nHuxley. See Huxley's \"Life and Letters,\" II., pages 286, 287.)\r\n\r\nWe have been paying Mr. Rich a little visit, and he has often spoken of\r\nyou, and I think he enjoyed much your and Mrs. Huxley's visit here.\r\nBut my object in writing now is to tell you something, which I am\r\nvery doubtful whether it is worth while for you to hear, because it is\r\nuncertain. My brother Erasmus has left me half his fortune, which is\r\nvery considerable. Therefore, I thought myself bound to tell Mr. Rich of\r\nthis, stating the large amount, as far as the executors as yet know it\r\nroughly. I then added that my wife and self thought that, under these\r\nnew circumstances, he was most fully justified in altering his will and\r\nleaving his property in some other way. I begged him to take a week to\r\nconsider what I had told him, and then by letter to inform me of the\r\nresult. But he would not, however, hardly allow me to finish what I had\r\nto say, and expressed a firm determination not to alter his will, adding\r\nthat I had five sons to provide for. After a short pause he implied (but\r\nunfortunately he here became very confused and forgot a word, which on\r\nsubsequent reflection I think was probably \"reversionary\")--he implied\r\nthat there was a chance, whether good or bad I know not, of his becoming\r\npossessed of some other property, and he finished by saying distinctly,\r\n\"I will bequeath this to Huxley.\" What the amount may be (I fear not\r\nlarge), and what the chance may be, God only knows; and one cannot\r\ncross-examine a man about his will. He did not bind me to secrecy, so I\r\nthink I am justified in telling you what passed, but whether it is wise\r\non my part to send so vague a story, I am not at all sure; but as a\r\ngeneral rule it is best to tell everything. As I know that you hate\r\nwriting letters, do not trouble yourself to answer this.\r\n\r\nP.S.--On further reflection I should like to hear that you receive this\r\nnote safely. I have used up all my black-edged paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 782. TO ANTHONY RICH. Down, February 4th, 1882.\r\n\r\nIt is always a pleasure to me to receive a letter from you. I am very\r\nsorry to hear that you have been more troubled than usual with your old\r\ncomplaint. Any one who looked at you would think that you had passed\r\nthrough life with few evils, and yet you have had an unusual amount of\r\nsuffering. As a turnkey remarked in one of Dickens' novels, \"Life is\r\na rum thing.\" (782/1. This we take to be an incorrect version of Mr.\r\nRoker's remark (in reference to Tom Martin, the Butcher), \"What a rum\r\nthing Time is, ain't it, Neddy?\" (\"Pickwick,\" Chapter XLII.). A careful\r\nstudent finds that women are also apostrophised as \"rum\": see the\r\nremarks of the dirty-faced man (\"Pickwick,\" Chapter XIV.).) As for\r\nmyself, I have been better than usual until about a fortnight ago,\r\nwhen I had a cough, and this pulled me down and made me miserable to a\r\nstrange degree; but my dear old wife insisted on my taking quinine, and,\r\nthough I have very little faith in medicine, this, I think, has done me\r\nmuch good. Well, we are both so old that we must expect some troubles: I\r\nshall be seventy-three on Feb. 12th. I have been glad to hear about the\r\npine-leaves, and you are the first man who has confirmed my account that\r\nthey are drawn in by the base, with a very few exceptions. (782/2. \"The\r\nFormation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms,\" 1881, page\r\n71.) With respect to your Wandsworth case, I think that if I had heard\r\nof it before publishing, I would have said nothing about the ledges\r\n(782/3. \"Ledges of Earth on Steep Hill-sides\" (ibid., page 278).);\r\nfor the Grisedale case (782/4. \"The steep, grass-covered sides of a\r\nmountainous valley in Westmorland, called Grisedale, were marked in\r\nmany places with innumerable, almost horizontal, little ledges...Their\r\nformation was in no way connected with the action of worms (and their\r\nabsence is an inexplicable fact)...(ibid., page 282.), mentioned in my\r\nbook and observed whilst I was correcting the proof-sheets, made me feel\r\nrather doubtful. Yet the Corniche case (782/5. Ibid., page 281.) shows\r\nthat worms at least aid in making the ledges. Nevertheless, I wish I had\r\nsaid nothing about the confounded ledges. The success of this worm book\r\nhas been almost laughable. I have, however, been plagued with an\r\nendless stream of letters on the subject; most of them very foolish\r\nand enthusiastic, but some containing good facts, which I have used in\r\ncorrecting yesterday the \"sixth Thousand.\"\r\n\r\nYour friend George's work about the viscous state of the earth and tides\r\nand the moon has lately been attracting much attention (782/6. Published\r\nin the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,\" 1879, 1880,\r\n1881.), and all the great judges think highly of the work. He intends to\r\ntry for the Plumian Professorship of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy\r\nat Cambridge, which is a good and honourable post of about 800 pounds\r\na year. I think that he will get it (782/7. He was elected Plumian\r\nProfessor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in 1883.) when\r\nChallis is dead, and he is very near his end. He has all the great\r\nmen--Sir W. Thomson, Adams, Stokes, etc.--on his side. He has lately\r\nbeen chief examiner for the Mathematical Tripos, which was tremendous\r\nwork; and the day before yesterday he started for Southampton for\r\na five-weeks' tour to Jamaica for complete rest, to see the Blue\r\nMountains, and escape the rigour of the early spring. I believe that\r\nGeorge will some day be a great scientific swell. The War Office has\r\njust offered Leonard a post in the Government Survey at Southampton, and\r\nvery civilly told him to go down and inspect the place, and accept or\r\nnot as he liked. So he went down, but has decided that it would not\r\nbe worth his while to accept, as it would entail his giving up his\r\nexpedition (on which he had been ordered) to Queensland, in Australia,\r\nto observe the Transit of Venus. (782/8. Major Leonard Darwin, late\r\nR.E., served in several scientific expeditions, including the Transits\r\nof Venus of 1874 and 1882.) Dear old William at Southampton has not been\r\nvery well, but is now better. He has had too much work--a willing horse\r\nis always overworked--and all the arrangements for receiving the British\r\nAssociation there this summer have been thrown on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut, good Heavens! what a deal I have written about my sons. I have had\r\nsome hard work this autumn with the microscope; but this is over, and\r\nI have only to write out the papers for the Linnean Society. (782/9.\r\ni. \"The Action of Carbonate of Ammonia on the Roots of Certain plants.\"\r\n[Read March 16th, 1882.] \"Journ. Linn. Soc.\" Volume XIX., 1882, page\r\n239. ii. \"The Action of Carbonate of Ammonia on Chlorophyll-bodies.\"\r\n[Read March 6th, 1882.] Ibid., page 262.) We have had a good many\r\nvisitors; but none who would have interested you, except perhaps Mrs.\r\nRitchie, the daughter of Thackeray, who is a most amusing and pleasant\r\nperson. I have not seen Huxley for some time, but my wife heard this\r\nmorning from Mrs. Huxley, who wrote from her bed, with a bad account\r\nof herself and several of her children; but none, I hope, are at all\r\ndangerously ill. Farewell, my kind, good friend.\r\n\r\nMany thanks about the picture, which if I survive you, and this I do not\r\nexpect, shall be hung in my study as a perpetual memento of you.\r\n\r\n(782/10. The concluding chapter of the \"Life and Letters\" gives some\r\naccount of the gradual failure in health which was perceptible in the\r\nlast year of Mr. Darwin's life. He died on April 19th, 1882, in his 74th\r\nyear.)\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n [The German a-, o-, u-diaeresis are treated as a, o, u, not as ae, oe,\r\n ue.]\r\n\r\n Aberrant genera, Darwin's work on.\r\n\r\n Abich, on Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n Abinger, excavations of Roman villa at.\r\n -plants from.\r\n\r\n Abinger Hall, Darwin visits.\r\n -Lord Farrer's recollections of Darwin at.\r\n\r\n Abiogenesis, Huxley's address on Biogenesis and.\r\n\r\n Abortion, Romanes on.\r\n\r\n Abrolhos, plants from the.\r\n\r\n Abromia.\r\n\r\n Abrus precatorius, dispersal of seeds.\r\n\r\n Abstract, Darwin's dislike of writing papers in.\r\n\r\n Abstract, the name applied by Darwin to the \"Origin.\"\r\n\r\n Abutilon, F.

Agassiz afterwards spent some years as a student in the\r\n Universities of Zurich, Heidelberg, and Munich, where he gained a\r\n reputation as a skilled fencer.  It was at Heidelberg that his studies took\r\n a definite turn towards Natural History.  He took a Ph.D. degree at\r\n Erlangen in 1829.  Agassiz published his first paper in \"Isis\" in 1828, and\r\n for many years devoted himself chiefly to Ichthyology.  During a visit to\r\n Paris he became acquainted with Cuvier and Alexander von Humboldt; in 1833,\r\n through the liberality of the latter, he began the publication of his\r\n \"Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles,\" and in 1840 he completed his\r\n \"Etudes sur les Glaciers.\"  In 1846 Agassiz went to Boston, where he\r\n lectured in the Lowell Institute, and in the following year became\r\n Professor of Geology and Zoology at Cambridge.  During the last\r\n twenty-seven years of his life Agassiz lived in America, and exerted a\r\n great influence on the study of Natural History in the United States.  In\r\n 1836 he received the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society of London,\r\n and in 1861 he was selected for the Copley Medal of the Royal Society.

He was awarded the Wollaston\r\n Medal of the Geological Society in 1855.  Barrande propounded the\r\n doctrine of \"colonies.\"  He found that in the Silurian strata of\r\n Bohemia, containing a normal succession of fossils, exceptional bands\r\n occurred which yielded fossils characteristic of a higher zone.  He\r\n named these bands \"colonies,\" and explained their occurrence by\r\n supposing that the later fauna represented in these \"precursory bands\"\r\n had already appeared in a neighbouring region, and that by some means\r\n communication was opened at intervals between this region and that in\r\n which the normal Silurian series was being deposited.  This apparent\r\n intercalation of younger among older zones has now been accounted for by\r\n infoldings and faulting of the strata.  See J.E.

He did not remain long in this uncongenial position, for in 1848\r\n he embarked for Para with Mr. Wallace, whose acquaintance he had made at\r\n Leicester some years previously.  Mr. Wallace left Brazil after four years'\r\n sojourn, and Bates remained for seven more years.  He suffered much ill-\r\n health and privation, but in spite of adverse circumstances he worked\r\n unceasingly:  witness the fact that his collection of insects numbered\r\n 14,000 specimens.  He became Assistant Secretary to the Royal Geographical\r\n Society in 1864, a post which he filled up to the time of his death in\r\n 1892.  In Mr. Clodd's interesting memoir prefixed to his edition of the\r\n \"Naturalist on the Amazons,\" 1892, the editor pays a warm and well-weighed\r\n tribute to Mr. Bates's honourable and lovable personal character.

In 1853 he was elected Perpetual Secretary of\r\n the French Academy, and in 1861 he became Vice-President of the Conseil\r\n General des Mines and a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.

Sir Samuel Bentham was at first\r\n in the Russian service, and afterwards in that of his own country, where he\r\n attained the rank of Inspector-General of Naval Works.  George Bentham was\r\n attracted to botany during a \"caravan tour\" through France in 1816, when he\r\n set himself to work out the names of flowers with De Candolle's \"Flore\r\n Francaise.\"  During this period he entered as a student of the Faculte de\r\n Theologie at Tours.  About 1820 he was turned to the study of philosophy,\r\n probably through an acquaintance with John Stuart Mill.  He next became the\r\n manager of his father's estates near Montpellier, and it was here that he\r\n wrote his first serious work, an \"Essai sur la Classification des Arts et\r\n Sciences.\"  In 1826 the Benthams returned to England, where he made many\r\n friends, among whom was Dr. Arnott; and it was in his company that Bentham,\r\n in 1824, paid a long visit to the Pyrenees, the fruits of which was his\r\n first botanical work, \"Catalogue des Plantes indigenes des Pyrenees, etc.\"\r\n 1826.  About this time Bentham entered Lincoln's Inn with a view to being\r\n called to the Bar, but the greater part of his energies was given to\r\n helping his Uncle Jeremy, and to independent work in logic and\r\n jurisprudence.  He published his \"Outlines of a New System of Logic\"\r\n (1827), but the merit of his work was not recognised until 1850.  In 1829\r\n Bentham finally gave up the Bar and took up his life's work as a botanist.\r\n In 1854 he presented his collections and books (valued at 6,000 pounds) to\r\n the Royal Gardens, Kew, and for the rest of his life resided in London, and\r\n worked daily at the Herbarium.  His work there began with the \"Flora of\r\n Hong Kong,\" which was followed by that of Australia published in 1867 in\r\n seven volumes octavo.  At the same time the \"Genera Plantarum\" was being\r\n planned; it was begun, with Dr. Hooker as a collaborator, in 1862, and\r\n concluded in 1883.  With this monumental work his labours ended; \"his\r\n strength...suddenly gave way...his visits to Kew ended, and lingering on\r\n under increasing debility, he died of old age on September 10th last\"\r\n (1883.)\r\n The amount of work that he accomplished was gigantic and of the most\r\n masterly character.  In speaking of his descriptive work the writer (Sir\r\n J.D. Hooker) of the obituary notice in \"Nature\" (October 2nd, 1884), from\r\n which many of the above facts are taken, says that he had \"no superior\r\n since the days of Linnaeus and Robert Brown, and he has left no equal\r\n except Asa Gray\" (\"Athenaeum,\" December 31st, 1850; \"Contemporary Review,\"\r\n May, 1873; \"George Bentham, F.R.S.\" By Sir J.D.

In 1857 he published his \"Introduction to\r\n Cryptogamic Botany.\"  (\"Annals of Botany,\" Volume XI., 1897, page ix;\r\n see also an obituary notice by Sir Joseph Hooker in the \"Proc.

In a paper \"On the Origin of\r\n Coal,\" published in the \"Memoirs of the Manchester Literary and\r\n Philosophical Society,\" Volume VIII., page 148, in 1848, Binney expressed\r\n the view that the sediments of the Coal Period were marine rather than\r\n estuarine, and were deposited on the floor of an ocean, which was\r\n characterised by a \"uniformity and shallowness unknown\" in any oceanic area\r\n of the present day.\r\n -on marshes of Coal period.\r\n -on coal and coal plants.\r\n\r\n Biogenesis, Huxley's address on abiogenesis and.\r\n\r\n Biology, Huxley's \"Course of Practical Instruction\" in.\r\n\r\n Biology of plants, Hooker's scheme for a Flora, with notes on.\r\n\r\n Birds, as agents of dispersal of plants.\r\n -blown to Madeira.\r\n -climate and effect on American.\r\n -coloration of.\r\n -comparison with mammals.\r\n -as isolated groups.\r\n -of Madeira.\r\n -modification in.\r\n -Andrew Murray on Wallace's theory of nests.\r\n -Wallace's theory of nests.\r\n -agents in dispersal of land-molluscs.\r\n -antics during courtship.\r\n -courtesy towards own image.\r\n -expression of fear by erection of feathers.\r\n -means of producing music.\r\n -spurs on female.\r\n -pairing.\r\n -polygamy.\r\n -proportion of sexes.\r\n -sexual selection and colour.\r\n -attracted by singing of bullfinch.\r\n -tameness in Brazilian species.\r\n -occurrence of unpaired.\r\n -Weir's observations on.\r\n\r\n Bird of paradise, and polygamy.\r\n\r\n Birmingham, British Association meeting (1849).\r\n\r\n Bivalves, means of dispersal of freshwater.\r\n\r\n Bizcacha, burrowing animal of Patagonia.\r\n\r\n Blackbird, variation in tufted.\r\n\r\n Blair, Rev.

Gould spoke of him as \"the founder of the study\" of\r\n Zoology in India.  His published writings are voluminous, and include,\r\n in addition to those bearing his name, numerous articles in the \"Field,\r\n Land and Water,\" etc., under the signature \"Zoophilus\" or \"Z.\"  He also\r\n communicated his knowledge to others with unsparing generosity, yet--\r\n doubtless the chief part of his \"extraordinary fund of information\" died\r\n with him.  Darwin had much correspondence with him, and always spoke of\r\n him with admiration for his powers of observation and for his judgment.\r\n  The letters to Blyth have unfortunately not come into our hands.  The\r\n indebtedness of Darwin to Blyth may be roughly gauged by the fact that\r\n the references under his name in the index to \"Animals and Plants\"\r\n occupy nearly a column.  For further information about Blyth see Grote's\r\n introduction to the \"Catalogue of Mammals and Birds of Burma, by the\r\n late E. Blyth\" in the \"Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\" Part\r\n II., Extra number, August 1875; also an obituary notice published at the\r\n time of his death in the \"Field.\"  Mr. Grote's Memoir contains a list of\r\n Blyth's writings which occupies nearly seven pages of the \"Journal.\"  We\r\n are indebted to Professor Newton for calling our attention to the\r\n sources of this note.\r\n -reference to letter from.\r\n -visits Down.\r\n -on Gallinaceae.\r\n\r\n Blytt, Axel Gudbrand (1843-98): the son of the well-known systematist M.N.\r\n Blytt.

Buckland travelled on horseback over a large part of the\r\n south-west of England, guided by the geological maps of William Smith.\r\n In 1813 he was appointed to the Chair of Mineralogy at Oxford, and soon\r\n afterwards to a newly created Readership in Geology.  In 1823 the\r\n \"Reliquiae Diluvianae\" was published, a work which aimed at supporting\r\n the records of revelation by scientific investigations.  In 1824\r\n Buckland was President of the Geological Society, and in the following\r\n year he left Oxford for the living of Stoke Charity, near Whitchurch,\r\n Hampshire.  \"The Bridgewater Treatise\" appeared in 1836.  In 1845\r\n Buckland was appointed Dean of Westminster; he was again elected\r\n president of the Geological Society in 1840, and in 1848 he received the\r\n Wollaston medal.

(1809-85): was born at Messina in\r\n 1809, and in 1829 entered Trinity College, Cambridge.  At the end of 1837\r\n he went with Sir George Napier to the Cape of Good Hope, and during a\r\n residence there of twelve months Bunbury devoted himself to botanical\r\n field-work, and afterwards (1848) published his \"Journal of a Residence at\r\n the Cape of Good Hope.\"  In 1844 Bunbury married the second daughter of Mr.\r\n Leonard Horner, Lady Lyell's sister.\r\n In addition to several papers dealing with systematic and geographical\r\n Botany Bunbury published numerous contributions on palaeobotanical\r\n subjects, a science with which his name will always be associated as one\r\n of those who materially assisted in raising the study of Fossil Plants\r\n to a higher scientific level.  His papers on fossil plants were\r\n published in the \"Journal of the Geological Society\" between 1846 and\r\n 1861, and shortly before his death a collection of botanical\r\n observations made in South Africa and South America was issued in book\r\n form in a volume entitled \"Botanical Fragments\" (London, 1883).  Bunbury\r\n was elected into the Royal Society in 1851, and from 1847 to 1853 he\r\n acted as Foreign Secretary to the Geological Society.  \"Life, Letters,\r\n and Journals of Sir Charles J.F.

At the time of his father's death,\r\n in 1841, seven volumes of the \"Prodromus\" had appeared:  Alphonse\r\n completed the seventeenth volume in 1873.  In 1855 appeared his\r\n \"Geographie botanique raisonnee,\" \"which was the most important work of\r\n his life,\" and if not a precursor, \"yet one of the inevitable\r\n foundation-stones\" of modern evolutionary principles.  He also wrote\r\n \"Histoire des Savants,\" 1873, and \"Phytographie,\" 1880.  He was lavish\r\n of assistance to workers in Botany, and was distinguished by a dignified\r\n and charming personality.  (See Sir W.

In 1832 he succeeded Dr. Royle as the Superintendent of the\r\n Botanic Gardens at Saharunpur; and in 1848, after spending some years in\r\n England, he was appointed Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Garden\r\n and Professor of Botany in the Medical College.  Although Falconer held an\r\n important botanical post for many years, he is chiefly known as a\r\n Palaeozoologist.  He seems, however, to have had a share in introducing\r\n Cinchona into India.  His discovery, in company with Colonel Sir Proby T.\r\n Cautley, of Miocene Mammalia in the Siwalik Hills, was at the time perhaps\r\n the greatest \"find\" which had been made.  The fossils of the Siwalik Hills\r\n formed the subject of Falconer's most important book, \"Fauna Antiqua\r\n Sivalensis,\" which, however, remained unfinished at the time of his death.\r\n Falconer also devoted himself to the investigation of the cave-fauna of\r\n England, and contributed important papers on fossils found in Sicily,\r\n Malta, and elsewhere.  Dr. Falconer was a Vice-President of the Royal\r\n Society and Foreign Secretary of the Geological Society.  \"Falconer did\r\n enough during his lifetime to render his name as a palaeontologist immortal\r\n in science; but the work which he published was only a fraction of what he\r\n accomplished...He was cautious to a fault; he always feared to commit\r\n himself to an opinion until he was sure he was right, and he died in the\r\n prime of his life and in the fulness of his power.\"  (Biographical sketch\r\n contributed by Charles Murchison to his edition of Hugh Falconer's\r\n \"Palaeontological Memoirs and Notes,\" London, 1868; \"Proc. R. Soc.\" Volume\r\n XV., page xiv., 1867:  \"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XXI., page xlv,\r\n 1865.)  Hugh Falconer was among those who did not fully accept the views\r\n expressed in the \"Origin of Species,\" but he could differ from Darwin\r\n without any bitterness.  Two years before the book was published, Darwin\r\n wrote to Asa Gray:  \"The last time I saw my dear old friend Falconer he\r\n attacked me most vigorously, but quite kindly, and told me, 'You will do\r\n more harm than any ten naturalists will do good.  I can see that you have\r\n already corrupted and half spoiled Hooker.'\"  (\"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\n page 121.)  The affectionate regard which Darwin felt for Falconer was\r\n shared by their common friend Hooker.  The following extract of a letter\r\n from Hooker to Darwin (February 3rd, 1865) shows clearly the strong\r\n friendships which Falconer inspired:  \"Poor old Falconer! how my mind runs\r\n back to those happiest of all our days that I used to spend at Down twenty\r\n years ago--when I left your home with my heart in my mouth like a\r\n schoolboy.  We last heard he was ill on Wednesday or Thursday, and sent\r\n daily to enquire, but the report was so good on Saturday that we sent no\r\n more, and on Monday night he died...What a mountainous mass of admirable\r\n and accurate information dies with our dear old friend!  I shall miss him\r\n greatly, not only personally, but as a scientific man of unflinching and\r\n uncompromising integrity--and of great weight in Murchisonian and other\r\n counsels where ballast is sadly needed.\"\r\n -article in \"Natural History Review.\"\r\n -Darwin's Copley medal and.\r\n -Darwin's criticism of his elephant work.\r\n -Darwin's regard for.\r\n -Forbes attacked by.\r\n -his opinion of Forbes.\r\n -goes to India.\r\n -Hooker's regard for.\r\n -letter to Darwin.\r\n -letter to Sharpey.\r\n -letters to.\r\n -letter to \"Athenaeum.\"\r\n -Lyell and.\r\n -on Mastodon andium.\r\n -on Mastodon of Australia.\r\n -on elephants.\r\n -Owen and.\r\n -on phyllotaxis.\r\n -on Plagiaulax.\r\n -speech at Cambridge.\r\n -\"Memoirs.\"\r\n\r\n Falkland Islands, Darwin visits.\r\n -Polyborus sp. in.\r\n -brightly coloured female hawk.\r\n -effect of subsidence.\r\n -streams of stones.\r\n\r\n Fanciers, use made of Selection by.\r\n\r\n Fantails, see Pigeons.\r\n\r\n Faraday, memorial to.\r\n\r\n Faramea, dimorphism.\r\n\r\n Farmer, Prof. J.B., and S.E.

He was called to the Bar, but gave up practice for the\r\n public service, where he became Permanent Secretary of the Board of Trade.\r\n According to the \"Times,\" October 13th, 1899, \"for nearly forty years he\r\n was synonymous with the Board in the opinion of all who were brought into\r\n close relation with it.\"  He was made a baronet in 1883; he retired from\r\n his post a few years later, and was raised to the peerage in 1893.  His\r\n friendship with Mr. Darwin was of many years' standing, and opportunities\r\n of meeting were more frequent in the last ten years of Mr. Darwin's life,\r\n owing to Lord Farrer's marriage with Miss Wedgwood, a niece of Mrs.\r\n Darwin's, and the subsequent marriage of his son Horace with Miss Farrer.\r\n His keen love of science is attested by the letters given in the present\r\n volume.  He published several excellent papers on the fertilisation of\r\n flowers in the \"Ann. and Mag. of Natural History,\" and in \"Nature,\" between\r\n 1868 and 1874.\r\n In Politics he was a Radical--a strong supporter of free trade:  on this\r\n last subject, as well as on bimetallism, he was frequently engaged in\r\n public controversy.  He loyally carried out many changes in the legislature\r\n which, as an individualist, he would in his private capacity have\r\n strenuously opposed.\r\n In the \"Speaker,\" October 21st, 1899, Lord Welby heads his article on Lord\r\n Farrer with a few words of personal appreciation:--\r\n \"In Lord Farrer has passed away a most interesting personality.  A great\r\n civil servant; in his later years a public man of courage and lofty ideal;\r\n in private life a staunch friend, abounding as a companion in humour and\r\n ripe knowledge.

This width of culture was combined with a severe and narrow\r\n religious creed, and though, as Edmund Gosse points out, there was in his\r\n father's case no reconcilement of science and religion, since his\r\n \"impressions of nature\" had to give way absolutely to his \"convictions of\r\n religion,\" yet he was not debarred by his views from a friendly intercourse\r\n with Darwin.  He did much to spread a love of Natural History, more\r\n especially by his seaside books, and by his introduction of the aquarium--\r\n the popularity of which (as Mr. Edmund Gosse shows) is reflected in the\r\n pages of \"Punch,\" especially in John Leech's illustrations.  Kingsley said\r\n of him (quoted by Edmund Gosse, page 344) \"Since White's \"History of\r\n Selborne\" few or no writers on Natural History, save Mr. Gosse and poor Mr.\r\n Edward Forbes, have had the power of bringing out the human side of\r\n science, and giving to seemingly dry disquisitions...that living and\r\n personal interest, to bestow which is generally the special function of the\r\n poet.\"  Among his books are the \"Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica,\" 1851; \"A\r\n Naturalist's Rambles on the Devonshire Coast,\" 1853; \"Omphalos,\" 1857; \"A\r\n Year at the Shore,\" 1865.

He became interested in science when a student at the Fairfield\r\n Academy; he took his doctor's degree in 1831, but instead of pursuing\r\n medical work he accepted the post of Instructor in Chemistry, Mineralogy,\r\n and Botany in the High School of Utica.  Gray afterwards became assistant\r\n to Professor Torrey in the New York Medical School, and in 1835 he was\r\n appointed Curator and Librarian of the New York Lyceum of Natural History.\r\n From 1842 to 1872 he occupied the Chair of Natural History in Harvard\r\n College, and the post of Director of the Cambridge Botanical Gardens; from\r\n 1872 till the time of his death he was relieved of the duties of teaching\r\n and of the active direction of the Gardens, but retained the Herbarium.\r\n Professor Gray was a Foreign Member of the Linnean and of the Royal\r\n Societies.  The \"Flora of North America\" (of which the first parts appeared\r\n in 1838), \"Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States, the Botany\r\n of Commodore Wilkes' South Pacific Exploring Expedition\" are among the most\r\n important of Gray's systematic memoirs; in addition to these he wrote\r\n several botanical text-books and a great number of papers of first-class\r\n importance.  In an obituary notice written by Sir Joseph Hooker, Asa Gray\r\n is described as \"one of the first to accept and defend the doctrine of\r\n Natural Selection..., so that Darwin, whilst fully recognising the\r\n different standpoints from which he and Gray took their departures, and\r\n their divergence of opinion on important points, nevertheless regarded him\r\n as the naturalist who had most thoroughly gauged the \"Origin of Species,\"\r\n and as a tower of strength to himself and his cause\" (\"Proc.

In 1841 he became Director of the Royal\r\n Botanic Gardens at Kew, which under his administration increased enormously\r\n in activity and importance.  His private Herbarium, said to be \"by far the\r\n richest ever accumulated in one man's lifetime,\" formed the nucleus of the\r\n present collection.

For\r\n some years Hopkins was very successful as a mathematical tutor; about\r\n 1833 he began to take a keen interest in geological subjects, and\r\n especially concerned himself with the effects of elevating forces acting\r\n from below on the earth's crust.  He was President of the Geological\r\n Society in 1851 and 1852 (\"Quart. Journ. Geol.

In 1827 Mr. Horner was invited to\r\n occupy the post of Warden in the London University,a position which he\r\n resigned in 1831; he also held for some years an Inspectorship of\r\n Factories.  As a Fellow of the Royal Society, Mr. Horner \"took an active\r\n part in bringing about certain changes in the management of the Society,\r\n which resulted in limiting to fifteen the number of new members to be\r\n annually elected...\"  In 1846 Horner was elected President of the\r\n Geological Society; and in 1860 he again presided over the Society, to\r\n the interests of which he had long devoted himself.  His contributions\r\n to the Society include papers on Stratigraphical Geology, Mineralogy,\r\n and other subjects.--\"Memoirs of Leonard Horner,\" edited by his\r\n daughter, Katherine M.

Leonard:  The following sketch of the life of\r\n Rev. Leonard Blomefield is taken from his \"Chapters in my Life; Reprint\r\n with Additions\" (privately printed), Bath, 1889.  He was born, as he states\r\n with characteristic accuracy, at 10 p.m., May 25th, 1800; and died at Bath,\r\n September 1st, 1893.  His father--a second cousin of Soame Jenyns, from\r\n whom he inherited Bottisham Hall, in Cambridgeshire--was a parson-squire of\r\n the old type, a keen sportsman, and a good man of business.  Leonard\r\n Jenyns' mother was a daughter of the celebrated Dr. Heberden, in whose\r\n house in Pall Mall he was born.  Leonard was educated at Eton and\r\n Cambridge, and became curate of Swaffham Bulbeck, a village close to his\r\n father's property; he was afterwards presented to the Vicarage of the\r\n parish, and held the living for nearly thirty years.  The remainder of his\r\n life he spent at Bath.  He was an excellent field-naturalist and a minute\r\n and careful observer.  Among his writings may be mentioned the Fishes in\r\n \"Zoology of the Voyage of the 'Beagle,'\" 1842, a \"Manual of British\r\n Vertebrate Animals,\" 1836, a \"Memoir\" of Professor Henslow,1862, to which\r\n Darwin contributed recollections of his old master, \"Observations in\r\n Natural History,\" 1846 and \"Observations in Meteorology,\" 1858, besides\r\n numerous papers in scientific journals.  In his \"Chapters\" he describes\r\n himself as showing as a boy the silent and retiring nature, and also the\r\n love of \"order, method, and precision,\" which characterised him through\r\n life; and he adds, \"even to old age I have been often called a VERY\r\n PARTICULAR GENTLEMAN.\"  In a hitherto unpublished passage in his\r\n autobiographical sketch, Darwin wrote, \"At first I disliked him from his\r\n somewhat grim and sarcastic expression; and it is not often that a first\r\n impression is lost; but I was completely mistaken, and found him very kind-\r\n hearted, pleasant, and with a good stock of humour.\"  Mr. Jenyns records\r\n that as a boy he was by a stranger taken for a son of his uncle, Dr.\r\n Heberden (the younger), whom he closely resembled.\r\n -letters to.\r\n -mentioned.\r\n\r\n Jodrell Laboratory, Darwin's interest in.\r\n -note on.\r\n\r\n Jordanhill, Smith of, on Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n \"Journal of Researches,\" Darwin's.\r\n\r\n Judd, Prof. J.W., letter to.\r\n -recollections of Darwin.\r\n -on Darwin's \"Volcanic Islands.\"\r\n -Darwin in praise of work of.\r\n\r\n Jukes, on imperfection of the Geological Record.\r\n -on changes of climate.\r\n -on formation of river-valleys.\r\n -over estimates sub-aerieal denudation.\r\n\r\n Jumps, variation by.\r\n\r\n Juncus, range of.\r\n -J. bufonius.\r\n -variation of.\r\n -germination of seed from mud carried by woodcock.\r\n\r\n Jura, Darwin on erratic blocks of.\r\n\r\n Jussieu, A. de.\r\n\r\n Kane's, E.K., \"Arctic Explorations,\" use of foxtails by Esquimaux\r\n referred to in.\r\n\r\n Kelvin, Lord, Address at the British Association Meeting at Edinburgh\r\n (1871).\r\n -on geological time.\r\n -on age of the earth.\r\n -on origin of plant-life from meteorites.\r\n\r\n Kemp, W., sends seeds to Darwin.\r\n -on vitality of seeds.\r\n\r\n Kensington, proposed removal of British Museum (Bloomsbury) collections\r\n to.\r\n\r\n Kerguelen cabbage, Chambers versus Hooker on the.\r\n\r\n Kerguelen island, coal-beds of.\r\n -relation of flora to that of Fuegia.\r\n -similarity between plants of S.

In 1829 he was chosen to be the first Professor of Botany at\r\n University College, London, and a few years later he became Lecturer to the\r\n Apothecaries' Company.  He is the author of a large number of botanical\r\n books, of which the best known is the \"Vegetable Kingdom,\" 1846.  He was\r\n one of the founders of the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" and was its principal\r\n editor up to the time of his death.  He was endowed with great powers of\r\n work and remarkable energy.  He is said as a young man to have translated\r\n Richard's \"Analyse du Fruit\" in a single sitting of three nights and two\r\n days.

(1797-1875): was born at Kinnordy, the\r\n family home in central Forfarshire.  At the age of seventeen he entered\r\n at Exeter College, Oxford, and afterwards obtained a second class in the\r\n final Honours School in Classics.  As an undergraduate Lyell attended\r\n Prof. Buckland's lectures on Geology.  On leaving Oxford Lyell was\r\n entered at Lincoln's Inn; a weakness of the eyes soon compelled him to\r\n give up reading, and he travelled abroad, finding many opportunities for\r\n field work.  He was called to the Bar in 1825, and in the same year\r\n published some papers on geological subjects.  From 1823-26 Lyell filled\r\n the post of Secretary to the Geological Society, and in 1826 was elected\r\n into the Royal Society.  In 1830 the first volume of the \"Principles of\r\n Geology\" was published; the second volume appeared two years later.\r\n Speaking of this greatest of Lyell's services to Geology, Huxley writes:\r\n \"I have recently read afresh the first edition of the \"Principles of\r\n Geology,\" and when I consider that this remarkable book had been nearly\r\n thirty years in everybody's hands [in 1859], and that it brings home to\r\n any reader of ordinary intelligence a great principle and a great fact--\r\n the principle that the past must be explained by the present, unless\r\n good cause be shown to the contrary; and the fact that, so far as our\r\n knowledge of the past history of life on our globe goes, no such cause\r\n can be shown--I cannot but believe that Lyell, for others, as for\r\n myself, was the chief agent in smoothing the road for Darwin\" (Huxley's\r\n \"Life and Letters,\" Volume II., page 190).  As Professor of Geology in\r\n King's College, London, Lyell delivered two courses of lectures in 1832-\r\n 33; in the latter year he received a Royal medal, and in 1858 he was the\r\n recipient of the Copley medal of the Royal Society.  The \"Elements of\r\n Geology\" was published in 1833; this work is still used as a text-book,\r\n a new edition having been lately (1896) brought out by Prof. Judd; in\r\n 1845 and in 1849 appeared the \"Travels in North America\" and \"A Second\r\n Visit to the United States of North America.\"  The \"Antiquity of Man\"\r\n was published in 1863.  Lyell was knighted in 1848, and in 1864 was\r\n raised to the rank of a Baronet.  He was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n Darwin wrote in his Autobiography:  \"The Science of Geology is enormously\r\n indebted to Lyell, more so, as I believe, than to any other man who ever\r\n lived\" (\"Life and Letters,\" Volume I., page 72).  In a letter to Lyell--\r\n November 23rd, 1859--Darwin wrote:  \"I rejoice profoundly that you intend\r\n admitting the doctrine of modification in your new edition [a new edition\r\n of the \"Manual\" published in 1865]; nothing, I am convinced, could be more\r\n important for its success.  I honour you most sincerely.  To have\r\n maintained, in the position of a master, one side of a question for thirty\r\n years, and then deliberately give it up, is a fact to which I much doubt\r\n whether the records of science offer a parallel\" (\"Life and Letters,\"\r\n Volume II., pages 229-30).

He is referred to in the\r\n \"Origin of Species\" (Edition VI., page 221) as having verified Darwin's\r\n statement as to the structure of the comb made by Melipona domestica, a\r\n Mexican species of bee. The cells of Melipona occupy an intermediate\r\n position between the perfect cells of the hive-bee and the much simpler\r\n ones of the humble-bee; the comb consists \"of cylindrical cells in which\r\n the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for\r\n holding honey.  These latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal\r\n sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass.  But the important point\r\n to notice is that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to\r\n each other that they would have intersected or broken into each other if\r\n the spheres had been completed; but this is never permitted, the bees\r\n building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to\r\n intersect.\"  It occurred to Darwin that certain changes in the architecture\r\n of the Melipona comb would produce a structure \"as perfect as the comb of\r\n the hive-bee.\"  He made a calculation, therefore, to show how this\r\n structural improvement might be effected, and submitted the statement to\r\n Professor Miller.  By a slight modification of the instincts possessed by\r\n Melipona domestica, this bee would be able to build with as much\r\n mathematical accuracy as the hive-bee; and by such modifications of\r\n instincts Darwin believed that \"the hive-bee has acquired, through natural\r\n selection, her inimitable architectural powers\" (loc. cit., page 222).\r\n -letters to.\r\n\r\n Million years, Darwin on meaning of a.\r\n\r\n Milne-Edwards, Darwin's cirripede work and.\r\n -Darwin's opinion of.\r\n -on retrograde development.\r\n\r\n Milne-Home, David (1805-90): was a country gentleman in Berwickshire who\r\n became interested in geology at an early age.

Weir's observations on.\r\n\r\n Muller, Ferd., on advance of European plants in Australia.\r\n\r\n Muller, (Fritz) Dr. Johann Friedrich Theodor (1822-97): was born in\r\n Thuringia, and left his native country at the age of thirty to take up his\r\n residence at Blumenau, Sta Catharina, South Brazil, where he was appointed\r\n teacher of mathematics at the Gymnasium of Desterro.  He afterwards held a\r\n natural history post, from which he was dismissed by the Brazilian\r\n Government in 1891 on the ground of his refusal to take up his residence at\r\n Rio de Janeiro (\"Nature,\" December 17th, 1891, page 156).  Muller published\r\n a large number of papers on zoological and botanical subjects, and rendered\r\n admirable service to the cause of evolution by his unrivalled powers of\r\n observation and by the publication of a work entitled \"Fur Darwin\" (1865),\r\n which was translated by Dallas under the title \"Facts and Arguments for\r\n Darwin\" (London, 1869).  The long series of letters between Darwin and\r\n Muller bear testimony to the friendship and esteem which Darwin felt for\r\n his co-worker in Brazil.  In a letter to Dr. Hermann Muller (March 29th,\r\n 1867), Mr. Darwin wrote:  \"I sent you a few days ago a paper on climbing\r\n plants by your brother, and I then knew for the first time that Fritz\r\n Muller was your brother.  I feel the greatest respect for him as one of the\r\n most able naturalists living, and he has aided me in many ways with\r\n extraordinary kindness.\"  See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 37; \"Nature,\"\r\n October 7th, 1897, Volume LVI., page 546.\r\n -book by.\r\n -convert to Darwin's views.\r\n -Darwin's opinion of his book.\r\n -friendship with Darwin.\r\n -Hooker on.\r\n -letters to.\r\n -on Lord Morton's mare.\r\n -on mutual specialisation of insects and plants.\r\n -on prawns.\r\n -reference to letter from.\r\n -on sponges.\r\n -on Cassia and caterpillars in S.

From an early age he\r\n was a keen naturalist, and began his scientific work as a collector in the\r\n field.  In 1855 he became Science teacher at Lippstadt, where he continued\r\n to work during the last twenty-eight years of his life.  Muller's greatest\r\n contribution to Botany \"Die Befruchtung der Blumen durch Insekten,\" was the\r\n outcome to Charles Darwin's book on the \"Fertilisation of Orchids.\"  He was\r\n a frequent contributor to \"Kosmos\" on subjects bearing on the origin of\r\n species, the laws of variation, and kindred problems; like his brother,\r\n Fritz, Hermann Muller was a zealous supporter of evolutionary views, and\r\n contributed in no small degree to the spread of the new teaching.

He\r\n graduated at Zurich with a dissertation on the Swiss species of Cirsium.\r\n At Jena he came under the influence of Schleiden, who taught him\r\n microscopic work.  He married in 1845, and on his wedding journey in\r\n England, collected seaweeds for \"Die neueren Algen-systeme.\"  He was called\r\n as Professor to Freiburg im Breisgau in 1852; and to Munich in 1857, where\r\n he remained until his death on May 10th, 1891.  In the \"Zeitschrift fur\r\n wiss. Botanik,\" 1844-46, edited by Nageli and Schleiden, and of which only\r\n a single volume appeared, Nageli insists on the only sound basis for\r\n classification being \"development as a whole.\"  The \"Entstehung und\r\n Begriff\" (1865) was his first real evolutionary paper.  He believed in a\r\n tendency of organisms to vary towards perfection.  His idea was that the\r\n causes of variability are internal to the organism:  see his work, \"Ueber\r\n den Einfluss ausserer Verhaltnisse auf die Varietatenbildung.  Among his\r\n other writings are the \"Theorie der Bastardbildung,\" 1866, and \"Die\r\n Mechanisch-physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre,\" 1884.  The chief\r\n idea of the latter book is the existence of Idioplasm, a part of protoplasm\r\n serving for hereditary transmission.  (From Dr. D.H.

He was subsequently apprenticed to a surgeon\r\n and apothecary, and became deeply interested in the study of anatomy.  He\r\n continued his medical training in Edinburgh and at St. Bartholomew's\r\n Hospital in London.  In 1827 Owen became assistant to William Clift (whose\r\n daughter Owen married in 1835), Conservator to the Hunterian Museum of the\r\n Royal College of Surgeons.  It was here that he became acquainted with\r\n Cuvier, at whose invitation he visited Paris, and attended his lectures and\r\n those of Geoffroy St. Hilaire.  The publication, in 1832, of the \"Memoir on\r\n the Pearly Nautilus\" placed the author \"in the front rank of anatomical\r\n monographers.\"  On Clift's retirement, Owen became sole Conservator to the\r\n Hunterian Museum, and was made first Hunterian Professor of Comparative\r\n Anatomy and Physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons.  In 1856 he\r\n accepted the post of Superintendent of the Natural History department of\r\n the British Museum, and shortly after his appointment he strongly urged the\r\n establishment of a National Museum of Natural History, a project which was\r\n eventually carried into effect in 1875.  In 1884 he was gazetted K.C.B.\r\n Owen was a strong opponent of Darwin's views, and contributed a bitter and\r\n anonymous article on the \"Origin of Species\" to the \"Edinburgh Review\" of\r\n 1860.  The position of Owen in the history of anatomical science has been\r\n dealt with by Huxley in an essay incorporated in the \"Life of Richard\r\n Owen,\" by his grandson, the Rev. Richard Owen (2 volumes, London, 1894).\r\n Huxley pays a high tribute to Owen's industry and ability:  \"During more\r\n than half a century Owen's industry remained unabated; and whether we\r\n consider the quality or the quantity of the work done, or the wide range of\r\n his labours, I doubt if, in the long annals of anatomy, more is to be\r\n placed to the credit of any single worker.\"  The record of his work is\r\n \"enough, and more than enough, to justify the high place in the scientific\r\n world which Owen so long occupied.  If I mistake not, the historian of\r\n comparative anatomy and palaeontology will always assign to Owen a place\r\n next to, and hardly lower than, that of Cuvier, who was practically the\r\n creator of those sciences in their modern shape, and whose works must\r\n always remain models of excellence in their kind.\"  On the other hand,\r\n Owen's contributions to philosophical anatomy are on a much lower plane;\r\n hardly any of his speculations in this field have stood the test of\r\n investigation:  \"...I am not sure that any one but the historian of\r\n anatomical science is ever likely to recur to them, and considering Owen's\r\n great capacity, extensive learning, and tireless industry, that seems a\r\n singular result of years of strenuous labour.\"\r\n -address at Leeds (British Association, 1858) by.\r\n -admission of descent of species.\r\n -articles by.\r\n -on a badger of Pliocene age.\r\n -on the brain.\r\n -Mrs. Carlyle's impression of.\r\n -and Hooker.\r\n -conduct towards Huxley.\r\n -Darwin abused by.\r\n -on Darwin and Maillet.\r\n -and Darwinism.\r\n -on ephemeral influence of the \"Origin.\"\r\n -Falconer and.\r\n -Huxley on.\r\n -on Huxley's election to the Athenaeum.\r\n -ignores Darwin's work.\r\n -influence of.\r\n -isolation among scientific men.\r\n -lecture on birds by.\r\n -letters to.\r\n -letter to the \"Athenaeum.\"\r\n -\"Life of.\"\r\n -on lowness of animals.\r\n -on Macacus.\r\n -on mammals of Old World.\r\n -on morphology of vertebrata.\r\n -review in the \"Quarterly\" of the \"Origin.\"\r\n -\"Palaeontology\" by.\r\n -on parthenogenesis.\r\n -review in the \"Edinburgh Review\" by.\r\n -on simple and multiple organs.\r\n -on use and disuse.\r\n -and Bishop Wilberforce's review.\r\n -visits Down.\r\n -attack on Darwin in his \"Anatomy of Vertebrata.\"\r\n -attitude towards Natural Selection.\r\n -mentioned.\r\n\r\n Owls and hawks, as agents in seed-dispersal.\r\n\r\n Oxalis, bulbils of.\r\n -cleistogamic flowers of.\r\n -dimorphism of.\r\n -pollen-tubes of.\r\n -seeds of.\r\n -trimorphism of.\r\n -O. acetosella, sensitive leaves of.\r\n -variation in length of pistil and stamens.\r\n -O. sensitiva, Darwin's work on.\r\n -O. corniculata, variation of.\r\n\r\n Oxford, meeting of the British Association at (1847).\r\n -Tuckwell's reminiscences of.\r\n\r\n Oxlips, Darwin's experiment on cowslips, primroses, and.\r\n -Darwin on hybrid character of.\r\n -scarcity of.\r\n\r\n Oxyspora paniculata, Wallich on.\r\n\r\n Pachira, inequality of cotyledons.\r\n -P. aquatica.\r\n\r\n Pacific Ocean, Darwin wishes Hooker to investigate floras of.\r\n -islands of the.\r\n -coral reefs of.\r\n\r\n Packard's \"Lamarck the Founder of Evolution.\"\r\n\r\n Paget, Sir J., on regeneration.\r\n -address on elemental pathology.\r\n -illness of.\r\n -on influence of mind on nutrition.\r\n -\"Lectures on Surgical Pathology.\"\r\n -letters to.\r\n -mentioned.\r\n\r\n Pairing, in birds.\r\n -vigour of birds and effect on time of.\r\n\r\n Palaeolithic flints, in gravels near Southampton.\r\n\r\n Palaeontology, rapid progress of.\r\n\r\n Palaeozoic period.\r\n\r\n Paley, idea of interference of Creator in construction of each species\r\n due to.\r\n\r\n \"Pall Mall,\" article on \"Dr. Hooker on Religion and Science\" in.\r\n -letter to editor of.\r\n\r\n Pallas, Darwin's conviction of truth of doctrine of.\r\n -doctrine of.\r\n -on hybrids and fertility.\r\n\r\n Palm, Malayan climbing.\r\n\r\n Palm, L.H., work on climbing plants by.\r\n\r\n Palma, crater of.\r\n\r\n Pampas, geology of the.\r\n -formation of.\r\n -Lyell on Mississippi beds and.\r\n -D'Orbigny's theory of formation of.\r\n -thistle of the.\r\n\r\n Pangenesis, adverse opinion on.\r\n -Bentham on.\r\n -Berkeley on.\r\n -bud-propagation and.\r\n -Darwin on.\r\n -Darwin's suggestion as to term.\r\n -difference between Galton's theory of heredity and.\r\n -evidence from hybridisation in favour of.\r\n -Hooker on.\r\n -Huxley's views on.\r\n -Jager on.\r\n -Lyell on.\r\n -and molecular hypothesis of Hackel.\r\n -Ranyard on.\r\n -Romanes on.\r\n -self-fertilisation and.\r\n -Wallace on.\r\n -the idea a relief to Darwin as connecting facts.\r\n -F.

He was the\r\n son of a farmer, and was born at Denholm (the birthplace the poet Leiden,\r\n to whom a monument has been erected in the public square of the village),\r\n in Roxburghshire.  At four years of age he was left an orphan, and was\r\n brought up in his aunt's household.\r\n He early showed a love of plants, and this was encouraged by his cousin,\r\n the Rev. James Duncan.  Scott told Darwin that he chose a gardening life as\r\n the best way of following science; and this is the more remarkable inasmuch\r\n as he was apprenticed at fourteen years of age.  He afterwards (apparently\r\n in 1859) entered the Royal Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, and became head of\r\n the propagating department under Mr. McNab.  His earliest publication, as\r\n far as we are aware, is a paper on Fern-spores, read before the Bot. Soc.,\r\n Edinburgh, on June 12th, 1862.  In the same year he was at work on orchids,\r\n and this led to his connection with Darwin, to whom he wrote in November\r\n 1862.  In 1864 he got an appointment at the Calcutta Botanic Garden, a\r\n position he owed to Sir J.D. Hooker, who was doubtless influenced by\r\n Darwin's high opinion of Scott.  It was on his way to India that Scott had,\r\n we believe, his only personal interview with Darwin.\r\n We are indebted to Sir George King for the interesting notes given below,\r\n which enable us to form an estimate of Scott's personality.  He was\r\n evidently of a proud and sensitive nature, and that his manner was pleasing\r\n and dignified appears from Darwin's brief mention of the interview.  He\r\n must have been almost morbidly modest, for Darwin wrote to Hooker (January\r\n 24th, 1864):  \"Remember my URGENT wish to be able to send the poor fellow a\r\n word of praise from any one.  I have had hard work to get him to allow me\r\n to send the [Primula] paper to the Linn. Soc., even after it was written\r\n out!\"  And this was after the obviously genuine appreciation of the paper\r\n given in Darwin's letters.  Sir George King writes:--\r\n \"He had taught himself a little Latin and a good deal of French, and he had\r\n read a good deal of English literature.  He was certainly one of the most\r\n remarkable self-taught men I ever met, and I often regret that I did not\r\n see more of him...Scott's manner was shy and modest almost to being\r\n apologetic; and the condition of nervous tension in which he seemed to live\r\n was indicated by frequent nervous gestures with his hands and by the\r\n restless twisting of his long beard in which he continuously indulged.  He\r\n was grave and reserved; but when he became interested in any matter he\r\n talked freely, although always deliberately, and he was always ready to\r\n deafen his opinions with much spirit.  He had, moreover, a considerable\r\n sense of humour.  What struck me most about Scott was the great acuteness\r\n of his powers of observing natural phenomena, and especially of such as had\r\n any bearing on variation, natural selection or hybridity.  While most\r\n attentive to the ordinary duties of the chief of a large garden, Scott\r\n always continued to find leisure for private study, and especially for the\r\n conduct of experiments in hybridization.  For the latter his position in\r\n the Calcutta garden afforded him many facilities.\r\n After obtaining a post in the Calcutta Botanic Gardens, Scott continued to\r\n work and to correspond with Darwin, but his work was hardly on a level with\r\n the promise of his earlier years.  According to the \"Journal of Botany,\" he\r\n was attacked by an affection of the spleen at Darjeeling, where he had been\r\n sent to report on the coffee disease.  He returned to Edinburgh in the\r\n spring of 1880, and died in the June of that year.\r\n At the time of his death many experiments were in hand, but his records of\r\n these were too imperfect to admit of their being taken up and continued\r\n after his death.  In temper Scott was most gentle and loveable, and to his\r\n friends he was loyal almost to a fault.  He was quite without ambition to\r\n 'get on' in the world; he had no low or mean motives; and than John Scott,\r\n Natural Science probably had no more earnest and single-minded devotee.\"\r\n -correspondence with.\r\n -criticism on the \"Origin\" by.\r\n -letters to.\r\n -on Natural Selection.\r\n -on a red cowslip.\r\n -confirms Darwin's work, also points out error.\r\n -Darwin assists financially.\r\n -Darwin's opinion of.\r\n -Darwin offers to present books to.\r\n -Darwin writes to Hooker about Indian appointment for.\r\n -Darwin's proposal that he should work at Down as his assistant.\r\n -Darwin suggests that he should work at Kew.\r\n -on dispersal of seed of Adenanthera by parrots.\r\n -on fertilisation of Acropera.\r\n -a good observer and experimentalist.\r\n -a lover of Natural History.\r\n -observations on acclimatisation of seeds.\r\n -on Oncidium flexuosum.\r\n -letter to Darwin from.\r\n -offered associateship of Linnean Society.\r\n -on Imatophyllum.\r\n -on self-sterility in Passiflora.\r\n -on Primula.\r\n -on sexes in Zea.\r\n -mentioned.\r\n\r\n Scrope, P., on volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n Scrophularineae.\r\n\r\n Scudder, on fossil insects.\r\n\r\n Sea, Dana underestimates power of.\r\n -changes in level of land due to those of.\r\n -marks left on land by action of.\r\n\r\n Seakale, bloom on.\r\n\r\n Seashore plants, use of bloom on.\r\n\r\n Sea-sickness, Darwin suffers from.\r\n\r\n \"Seasons with the Sea Horses,\" Lamont's.\r\n\r\n Secondary period, abundance of Araucarias and Marsupials during.\r\n -equality of elevation in British rocks of.\r\n -insects prior to.\r\n\r\n Sections of earth's crust, need for accurate.\r\n\r\n Sedgwick, Prof. A., extract from letter to Owen from.\r\n -letter to Darwin from.\r\n -on the \"Vestiges of Creation.\"\r\n -and the Philosophical Society's meeting at Cambridge.\r\n -and the \"Spectator.\"\r\n -Darwin's visit to.\r\n -Feelings towards Darwin.\r\n -on the structure of large mineral masses.\r\n -proposes Forbes for Royal medal.\r\n -quotation from letter to Darwin from.\r\n -suggested as candidate for Royal medal.\r\n -mentioned.\r\n\r\n Sedgwick, A., address at the British Association (1899).\r\n\r\n Sedimentary strata, conversion into schists.\r\n\r\n Sedimentation, connection with elevation and subsidence.\r\n -near coast-lines.\r\n\r\n Seedlings, sensitiveness to light.\r\n\r\n Seeds, collected by girls in Prof. Henslow's parish.\r\n -dispersal of.\r\n -effect of immersion on.\r\n -of furze.\r\n -Asa Gray on Darwin's salt-water experiments.\r\n -germination after 21 1/2 hours in owl's stomach.\r\n -moss-roses raised from.\r\n -peaches from.\r\n -variation in.\r\n -bright colours of fruits and.\r\n -difficulty of finding in samples of earth.\r\n -dormant state of.\r\n -germination from pond mud.\r\n -Hildebrand on dispersal of.\r\n -mucus emitted by.\r\n -stored by ants.\r\n -supposed vivification of fossil.\r\n -vitality of.\r\n\r\n Seeley, Prof.\r\n\r\n Seemann, on commingling of temperate and tropical plants in mountains of\r\n Panama.\r\n -on the \"Origin\" in Germany.\r\n -mentioned.\r\n\r\n Segregation of minerals in foliated rocks.\r\n\r\n Selaginella, foot of, compared with organ in Welwitschia seedling.\r\n\r\n Selection, a misleading term.\r\n -artificial.\r\n -as means of improving breeds.\r\n -importance of.\r\n -influence of speedy.\r\n -utilised by pigeon-fanciers.\r\n -Sexual (see Sexual Selection).\r\n -sterility and.\r\n -unconscious.\r\n -and variation.\r\n -voluntary.\r\n -and inheritance.\r\n\r\n Self-fertilisation, abundance of seeds from.\r\n -Darwin's experiments on cross- and.\r\n -evil results of.\r\n -comparison between seeds from cross- and.\r\n -in Goodeniaceae.\r\n -in Orchids.\r\n\r\n Self-interest, Preston on.\r\n\r\n Self-sterility, in Eschscholtzia.\r\n -in plants.\r\n -connection with unnatural conditions.\r\n\r\n Selliera, Hamilton on fertilisation-mechanism.\r\n\r\n Semper, Karl (1832-93): Professor of Zoology at Wurzburg.

He entered at\r\n Trinity College, Cambridge, and obtained a fellowship there after being\r\n fifth classic in 1831.  He was therefore a contemporary of Darwin's at the\r\n University, though not a \"schoolmate,\" as the \"American Entomologist\" puts\r\n it.  He was the author of \"A Historical Account of the University of\r\n Cambridge and its Colleges,\" London, 2nd edition, 1837; also of a\r\n translation of part of \"Aristophanes,\" 1837:  from the dedication of this\r\n book it seems that he was at St. Paul's School, London.  He settled in\r\n America in 1838, but only began serious Entomology about 1858.  He never\r\n returned to England.\r\n In a letter to Mr. Darwin, November 7th, 1864, he gives a curious account\r\n of the solitary laborious life he led for many years.  \"When I left England\r\n in 1838,\" he writes, \"I was possessed with an absurd notion that I would\r\n live a perfectly natural life, independent of the whole world--in me ipso\r\n totus teres atque rotundus.  So I bought several hundred acres of wild land\r\n in the wilderness, twenty miles from any settlement that you would call\r\n even a village, and with only a single neighbor.  There I gradually opened\r\n a farm, working myself like a horse, raising great quantities of hogs and\r\n bullocks...I did all kinds of jobs for myself, from mending a pair of boots\r\n to hooping a barrel.\"  After nearly dying of malaria, he sold his land at a\r\n great loss, and found that after twelve years' work he was just 1000\r\n dollars poorer than when he began.  He then went into the lumber business\r\n at Rock Island, Illinois.  After seven years he invested most of his\r\n savings in building \"ten two-storey brick houses for rent.\"  He states that\r\n the repairs of the houses occupied about one-fourth of his time, and the\r\n remainder he was able to devote to entomology.  He afterwards edited the\r\n \"Practical Entomologist.\"  In regard to this work he wrote (February 25th,\r\n 1867):--\"Editing the 'Practical Entomologist' does undoubtedly take up a\r\n good deal of my time, but I also pick up a good deal of information of real\r\n scientific value from its correspondents.  Besides, this great American\r\n nation has hitherto had a supreme contempt for Natural History, because\r\n they have hitherto believed that it has nothing to do with the dollars and\r\n cents.  After hammering away at them for a year or two, I have at last\r\n succeeded in touching the 'pocket nerve' in Uncle Sam's body, and he is\r\n gradually being galvanised into the conviction that science has the power\r\n to make him richer.\"  It is difficult to realise that even forty years ago\r\n the position of science in Illinois was what Mr. Walsh describes it to be:\r\n \"You cannot have the remotest conception of the ideas of even our best-\r\n educated Americans as to the pursuit of science.  I never yet met with a\r\n single one who could be brought to understand how or why a man should\r\n pursue science for its own pure and holy sake.\"\r\n Mr. L.O. Howard (\"Insect Life,\" Volume VII., 1895, page 59) says that\r\n Harris received from the State of Massachusetts only 175 dollars for his\r\n classical report on injurious insects which appeared in 1841 and was\r\n reprinted in 1842 and 1852.  It would seem that in these times\r\n Massachusetts was in much the same state of darkness as Illinois.  In the\r\n winter of 1868-9 Walsh was, however, appointed State Entomologist of\r\n Illinois.  He made but one report before his death.  He was a man of\r\n liberal ideas, hating oppression and wrong in all its forms.  On one\r\n occasion his life was threatened for an attempt to purify the town council.\r\n As an instance of \"hereditary genius\" it may be mentioned that his brother\r\n was a well-known writer on natural history and sporting subjects, under the\r\n pseudonym \"Stonehenge.\"  The facts here given are chiefly taken from the\r\n \"American Entomologist\" (St. Louis, Mo.), Volume II., page 65.\r\n -as entomologist.\r\n -letters to.\r\n -letter to Darwin from.\r\n -death of.\r\n -and C.V.

He was a born naturalist, and his\r\n \"aptitude for exact observation was of the highest order\" (Mr. M'Lachlan\r\n in the \"Entomologist's Monthly Magazine,\" May 1894).  He is chiefly\r\n known as an entomologist, but he had also extensive knowledge of\r\n Ornithology, Horticulture, and of the breeds of various domestic animals\r\n and cage-birds.
