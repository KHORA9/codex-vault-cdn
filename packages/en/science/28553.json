This question has been put to me so often by persons\r\nyoung and old that I have at last decided to answer it in such a manner\r\nthat a much larger public than that with which I have personal\r\nacquaintance may be able to satisfy themselves as to the principles\r\nunderlying many of the mechanisms met with in everyday life.\r\n\r\nIn order to include steam, electricity, optics, hydraulics, thermics,\r\nlight, and a variety of detached mechanisms which cannot be classified\r\nunder any one of these heads, within the compass of about 450 pages, I\r\nhave to be content with a comparatively brief treatment of each subject.\r\nThis brevity has in turn compelled me to deal with principles rather\r\nthan with detailed descriptions of individual devices--though in several\r\ncases recognized types are examined. The reader will look in vain for\r\naccounts of the Yerkes telescope, of the latest thing in motor cars, and\r\nof the largest locomotive. But he will be put in the way of\r\nunderstanding the essential nature of _all_ telescopes, motors, and\r\nsteam-engines so far as they are at present developed, which I think may\r\nbe of greater ultimate profit to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nWhile careful to avoid puzzling the reader by the use of mysterious\r\nphraseology I consider that the parts of a machine should be given their\r\ntechnical names wherever possible. To prevent misconception, many of\r\nthe diagrams accompanying the letterpress have words as well as letters\r\nwritten on them. This course also obviates the wearisome reference from\r\ntext to diagram necessitated by the use of solitary letters or figures.\r\n\r\nI may add, with regard to the diagrams of this book, that they are\r\npurposely somewhat unconventional, not being drawn to scale nor\r\nconforming to the canons of professional draughtsmanship. Where\r\nadvisable, a part of a machine has been exaggerated to show its details.\r\nAs a rule solid black has been preferred to fine shading in sectional\r\ndrawings, and all unnecessary lines are omitted. I would here\r\nacknowledge my indebtedness to my draughtsman, Mr. Frank Hodgson, for\r\nhis care and industry in preparing the two hundred or more diagrams for\r\nwhich he was responsible.\r\n\r\nFour organs of the body--the eye, the ear, the larynx, and the\r\nheart--are noticed in appropriate places. The eye is compared with the\r\ncamera, the larynx with a reed pipe, the heart with a pump, while the\r\near fitly opens the chapter on acoustics. The reader who is unacquainted\r\nwith physiology will thus be enabled to appreciate the better these\r\nmarvellous devices, far more marvellous, by reason of their absolutely\r\nautomatic action, than any creation of human hands.\r\n\r\n  A.W.\r\n\r\nUPLANDS, STOKE POGES, BUCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.--THE STEAM-ENGINE.\r\n\r\nWhat is steam?--The mechanical energy

Heat water above 212° Fahrenheit, and the molecules exhibit a\r\nviolent mutual repulsion, and, like dormant bees revived by spring\r\nsunshine, separate and dart to and fro. If confined in an air-tight\r\nvessel, the molecules have their flights curtailed, and beat more and\r\nmore violently against their prison walls, so that every square inch of\r\nthe vessel is subjected to a rising pressure. We may compare the action\r\nof the steam molecules to that of bullets fired from a machine-gun at a\r\nplate mounted on a spring. The faster the bullets came, the greater\r\nwould be the continuous compression of the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANICAL ENERGY OF STEAM.\r\n\r\nIf steam is let into one end of a cylinder behind an air-tight but\r\nfreely-moving piston, it will bombard the walls of the cylinder and the\r\npiston; and if the united push of the molecules on the one side of the\r\nlatter is greater than the resistance on the other side opposing its\r\nmotion, the piston must move. Having thus partly got their liberty, the\r\nmolecules become less active, and do not rush about so vigorously. The\r\npressure on the piston decreases as it moves. But if the piston were\r\ndriven back to its original position against the force of the steam, the\r\nmolecular activity--that is, pressure--would be restored. We are here\r\nassuming that no heat has passed through the cylinder or piston and been\r\nradiated into the air; for any loss of heat means loss of energy, since\r\nheat _is_ energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOILER.\r\n\r\nThe combustion of fuel in a furnace causes the walls of the furnace to\r\nbecome _hot_, which means that the molecules of the substance forming\r\nthe walls are thrown into violent agitation. If the walls are what are\r\ncalled \"good conductors\" of heat, they will transmit the agitation\r\nthrough them to any surrounding substance. In the case of the ordinary\r\nhouse stove this is the air, which itself is agitated, or grows warm. A\r\nsteam-boiler has the furnace walls surrounded by water, and its function\r\nis to transmit molecular movement (heat, or energy) through the furnace\r\nplates to the water until the point is reached when steam generates. At\r\natmospheric pressure--that is, if not confined in any way--steam would\r\nfill 1,610 times the space which its molecules occupied in their watery\r\nformation. If we seal up the boiler so that no escape is possible for\r\nthe steam molecules, their motion becomes more and more rapid, and\r\n_pressure_ is developed by their beating on the walls of the boiler.\r\nThere is theoretically no limit to which the pressure may be raised,\r\nprovided that sufficient fuel-combustion energy is transmitted to the\r\nvaporizing water.\r\n\r\nTo raise steam in large quantities we must employ a fuel which develops\r\ngreat heat in proportion to its weight, is readily procured, and cheap.\r\nCoal fulfils all these conditions. Of the 800 million tons mined\r\nannually throughout the world, 400 million tons are burnt in the\r\nfurnaces of steam-boilers.\r\n\r\nA good boiler must be--(1) Strong enough to withstand much higher\r\npressures than that at which it is worked; (2) so designed as to burn\r\nits fuel to the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\nEven in the best-designed boilers a large part of the combustion heat\r\npasses through the chimney, while a further proportion is radiated from\r\nthe boiler. Professor John Perry[1] considers that this waste amounts,\r\nunder the best conditions at present obtainable, to eleven-twelfths of\r\nthe whole. We have to burn a shillingsworth of coal to capture the\r\nenergy stored in a pennyworth. Yet the steam-engine of to-day is three\r\nor four times as efficient as the engine of fifty years ago. This is due\r\nto radical improvements in the design of boilers and of the machinery\r\nwhich converts the heat energy of steam into mechanical motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULATION OF WATER IN A BOILER.\r\n\r\nIf you place a pot filled with water on an open fire, and watch it when\r\nit boils, you will notice that the water heaves up at the sides and\r\nplunges down at the centre. This is due to the water being heated most\r\nat the sides, and therefore being lightest there. The rising\r\nsteam-bubbles also carry it up. On reaching the surface, the bubbles\r\nburst, the steam escapes, and the water loses some of its heat, and\r\nrushes down again to take the place of steam-laden water rising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIf the fire is very fierce, steam-bubbles may rise from all points at\r\nthe bottom, and impede downward currents (Fig. 1). The pot then \"boils\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 2 shows a method of preventing this trouble. We lower into our pot\r\na vessel of somewhat smaller diameter, with a hole in the bottom,\r\narranged in such a manner as to leave a space between it and the pot\r\nall round. The upward currents are then separated entirely from the\r\ndownward, and the fire can be forced to a very much greater extent than\r\nbefore without the water boiling over. This very simple arrangement is\r\nthe basis of many devices for producing free circulation of the water in\r\nsteam-boilers.\r\n\r\nWe can easily follow out the process of development. In Fig. 3 we see a\r\nsimple U-tube depending from a vessel of water. Heat is applied to the\r\nleft leg, and a steady circulation at once commences. In order to\r\nincrease the heating surface we can extend the heated leg into a long\r\nincline (Fig. 4), beneath which three lamps instead of only one are\r\nplaced. The direction of the circulation is the same, but its rate is\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nA further improvement results from increasing the number of tubes (Fig.\r\n5), keeping them all on the slant, so that the heated water and steam\r\nmay rise freely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENCLOSED FURNACE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nStill, a lot of the heat gets away. In a steam-boiler the burning fuel\r\nis enclosed either by fire-brick or a \"water-jacket,\" forming part of\r\nthe boiler. A water-jacket signifies a double coating of metal plates\r\nwith a space between, which is filled with water (see Fig. 6). The fire\r\nis now enclosed much as it is in a kitchen range. But our boiler must\r\nnot be so wasteful of the heat as is that useful household fixture. On\r\ntheir way to the funnel the flames and hot gases should act on a very\r\nlarge metal or other surface in contact with the water of the boiler, in\r\norder to give up a due proportion of their heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Diagrammatic sketch of a locomotive type of\r\nboiler. Water indicated by dotted lines. The arrows show the direction\r\ntaken by the air and hot gases from the air-door to the funnel.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MULTITUBULAR BOILER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Babcock and Wilcox water-tube boiler. One\r\nside of the brick seating has been removed to show the arrangement of\r\nthe water-tubes and furnace.]\r\n\r\nTo save room, boilers which have to make steam very quickly and at high\r\npressures are largely composed of pipes. Such boilers we call\r\nmultitubular. They are of two kinds--(1) _Water_-tube boilers; in which\r\nthe water circulates through tubes exposed to the furnace heat. The\r\nBabcock and Wilcox boiler (Fig. 7) is typical of this variety. (2)\r\n_Fire_-tube boilers; in which the hot gases pass through tubes\r\nsurrounded by water. The ordinary locomotive boiler (Fig. 6) illustrates\r\nthis form.\r\n\r\nThe Babcock and Wilcox boiler is widely used in mines, power stations,\r\nand, in a modified form, on shipboard. It consists of two main\r\nparts--(1) A drum, H, in the upper part of which the steam collects; (2)\r\na group of pipes arranged on the principle illustrated by Fig. 5. The\r\nboiler is seated on a rectangular frame of fire-bricks. At one end is\r\nthe furnace door; at the other the exit to the chimney. From the furnace\r\nF the flames and hot gases rise round the upper end of the sloping tubes\r\nTT into the space A, where they play upon the under surface of H before\r\nplunging downward again among the tubes into the space B. Here the\r\ntemperature is lower. The arrows indicate further journeys upwards into\r\nthe space C on the right of a fire-brick division, and past the down\r\ntubes SS into D, whence the hot gases find an escape into the chimney\r\nthrough the opening E. It will be noticed that the greatest heat is\r\nbrought to bear on TT near their junction with UU, the \"uptake\" tubes;\r\nand that every succeeding passage of the pipes brings the gradually\r\ncooling gases nearer to the \"downtake\" tubes SS.\r\n\r\nThe pipes TT are easily brushed and scraped after the removal of plugs\r\nfrom the \"headers\" into which the tube ends are expanded.\r\n\r\nOther well-known water-tube boilers are the Yarrow, Belleville,\r\nStirling, and Thorneycroft, all used for driving marine engines.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE-TUBE BOILERS.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 shows a locomotive boiler in section. To the right is the\r\nfire-box, surrounded on all sides by a water-jacket in direct\r\ncommunication with the barrel of the boiler. The inner shell of the\r\nfire-box is often made of copper, which withstands the fierce heat\r\nbetter than steel; the outer, like the rest of the boiler, is of steel\r\nplates from 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. The shells of the jacket are braced\r\ntogether by a large number of rivets, RR; and the top, or crown, is\r\nstrengthened by heavy longitudinal girders riveted to it, or is braced\r\nto the top of the boiler by long bolts. A large number of fire-tubes\r\n(only three are shown in the diagram for the sake of simplicity) extend\r\nfrom the fire-box to the smoke-box. The most powerful \"mammoth\" American\r\nlocomotives have 350 or more tubes, which, with the fire-box, give 4,000\r\nsquare feet of surface for the furnace heat to act upon. These tubes\r\nare expanded at their ends by a special tool into the tube-plates of the\r\nfire-box and boiler front. George Stephenson and his predecessors\r\nexperienced great difficulty in rendering the tube-end joints quite\r\nwater-tight, but the invention of the \"expander\" has removed this\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe _fire-brick arch_ shown (Fig. 6) in the fire-box is used to deflect\r\nthe flames towards the back of the fire-box, so that the hot gases may\r\nbe retarded somewhat, and their combustion rendered more perfect. It\r\nalso helps to distribute the heat more evenly over the whole of the\r\ninside of the box, and prevents cold air from flying directly from the\r\nfiring door to the tubes. In some American and Continental locomotives\r\nthe fire-brick arch is replaced by a \"water bridge,\" which serves the\r\nsame purpose, while giving additional heating surface.\r\n\r\nThe water circulation in a locomotive boiler is--upwards at the fire-box\r\nend, where the heat is most intense; forward along the surface;\r\ndownwards at the smoke-box end; backwards along the bottom of the\r\nbarrel.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER TYPES OF BOILERS.\r\n\r\nFor small stationary land engines the _vertical_ boiler is much used.\r\nIn Fig. 8 we have three forms of this type--A and B with cross\r\nwater-tubes; C with vertical fire-tubes. The furnace in every case is\r\nsurrounded by water, and fed through a door at one side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Diagrammatic representation of three types of\r\nvertical boilers.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lancashire_ boiler is of large size. It has a cylindrical shell,\r\nmeasuring up to 30 feet in length and 7 feet in diameter, traversed from\r\nend to end by two large flues, in the rear part of which are situated\r\nthe furnaces. The boiler is fixed on a seating of fire-bricks, so built\r\nup as to form three flues, A and BB, shown in cross section in Fig. 9.\r\nThe furnace gases, after leaving the two furnace flues, are deflected\r\ndownwards into the channel A, by which they pass underneath the boiler\r\nto a point almost under the furnace, where they divide right and left\r\nand travel through cross passages into the side channels BB, to be led\r\nalong the boiler's flanks to the chimney exit C. By this arrangement the\r\neffective heating surface is greatly increased; and the passages being\r\nlarge, natural draught generally suffices to maintain proper combustion.\r\nThe Lancashire boiler is much used in factories and (in a modified form)\r\non ships, since it is a steady steamer and is easily kept in order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Cross and longitudinal sections of a Lancashire\r\nboiler.]\r\n\r\nIn marine boilers of cylindrical shape cross water-tubes and fire-tubes\r\nare often employed to increase the heating surface. Return tubes are\r\nalso led through the water to the funnels, situated at the same end as\r\nthe furnace.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIDS TO COMBUSTION.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn our attention more particularly to the chemical process\r\ncalled _combustion_, upon which a boiler depends for its heat. Ordinary\r\nsteam coal contains about 85 per cent. of carbon, 7 per cent. of oxygen,\r\nand 4 per cent. of hydrogen, besides traces of nitrogen and sulphur and\r\na small incombustible residue. When the coal burns, the nitrogen is\r\nreleased and passes away without combining with any of the other\r\nelements. The sulphur unites with hydrogen and forms sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen (also named sulphurous acid), which is injurious to steel\r\nplates, and is largely responsible for the decay of tubes and funnels.\r\nMore of the hydrogen unites with the oxygen as steam.\r\n\r\nThe most important element in coal is the carbon (known chemically by\r\nthe symbol C). Its combination with oxygen, called combustion, is the\r\nact which heats the boiler. Only when the carbon present has combined\r\nwith the greatest possible amount of oxygen that it will take into\r\npartnership is the combustion complete and the full heat-value (fixed by\r\nscientific experiment at 14,500 thermal units per pound of carbon)\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nNow, carbon may unite with oxygen, atom for atom, and form _carbon\r\nmonoxide_ (CO); or in the proportion of one atom of carbon to _two_ of\r\noxygen, and form _carbon dioxide_ (CO_2). The former gas is\r\ncombustible--that is, will admit another atom of carbon to the\r\nmolecule--but the latter is saturated with oxygen, and will not burn,\r\nor, to put it otherwise, is the product of _perfect_ combustion. A\r\nproperly designed furnace, supplied with a due amount of air, will cause\r\nnearly all the carbon in the coal burnt to combine with the full amount\r\nof oxygen. On the other hand, if the oxygen supply is inefficient, CO as\r\nwell as CO_2 will form, and there will be a heat loss, equal in\r\nextreme cases to two-thirds of the whole. It is therefore necessary that\r\na furnace which has to eat up fuel at a great pace should be\r\nartificially fed with air in the proportion of from 12 to 20 _pounds_ of\r\nair for every pound of fuel. There are two methods of creating a violent\r\ndraught through the furnace. The first is--\r\n\r\nThe _forced draught_; very simply exemplified by the ordinary bellows\r\nused in every house. On a ship (Fig. 10) the principle is developed as\r\nfollows:--The boilers are situated in a compartment or compartments\r\nhaving no communication with the outer air, except for the passages down\r\nwhich air is forced by powerful fans at a pressure considerably greater\r\nthan that of the atmosphere. There is only one \"way out\"--namely,\r\nthrough the furnace and tubes (or gas-ways) of the boiler, and the\r\nfunnel. So through these it rushes, raising the fuel to white heat. As\r\nmay easily be imagined, the temperature of a stokehold, especially in\r\nthe tropics, is far from pleasant. In the Red Sea the thermometer\r\nsometimes rises to 170° Fahrenheit or more, and the poor stokers have a\r\nvery bad time of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Sketch showing how the \"forced draught\" is\r\nproduced in a stokehold and how it affects the furnaces.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE IN THE STOKEHOLD OF A BATTLE-SHIP.]\r\n\r\nThe second system is that of the _induced draught_. Here air is\r\n_sucked_ through the furnace by creating a vacuum in the funnel and in a\r\nchamber opening into it. Turning to Fig. 6, we see a pipe through which\r\nthe exhaust steam from the locomotive's cylinders is shot upwards into\r\nthe funnel, in which, and in the smoke-box beneath it, a strong vacuum\r\nis formed while the engine is running. Now, \"nature abhors a vacuum,\" so\r\nair will get into the smoke-box if there be a way open. There\r\nis--through the air-doors at the bottom of the furnace, the furnace\r\nitself, and the fire-tubes; and on the way oxygen combines with the\r\ncarbon of the fuel, to form carbon dioxide. The power of the draught is\r\nso great that, as one often notices when a train passes during the\r\nnight, red-hot cinders, plucked from the fire-box, and dragged through\r\nthe tubes, are hurled far into the air. It might be mentioned in\r\nparenthesis that the so-called \"smoke\" which pours from the funnel of a\r\nmoving engine is mainly condensing steam. A steamship, on the other\r\nhand, belches smoke only from its funnels, as fresh water is far too\r\nprecious to waste as steam. We shall refer to this later on (p. 72).\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILER FITTINGS.\r\n\r\nThe most important fittings on a boiler are:--(1) the safety-valve; (2)\r\nthe water-gauge; (3) the steam-gauge; (4) the mechanisms for feeding it\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAFETY-VALVE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thurston, an eminent authority on the steam-engine, has\r\nestimated that a plain cylindrical boiler carrying 100 lbs. pressure to\r\nthe square inch contains sufficient stored energy to project it into the\r\nair a vertical distance of 3-1/2 miles. In the case of a Lancashire\r\nboiler at equal pressure the distance would be 2-1/2 miles; of a\r\nlocomotive boiler, at 125 lbs., 1-1/2 miles; of a steam tubular boiler,\r\nat 75 lbs., 1 mile. According to the same writer, a cubic foot of heated\r\nwater under a pressure of from 60 to 70 lbs. per square inch has _about\r\nthe same energy as one pound of gunpowder_.\r\n\r\nSteam is a good servant, but a terrible master. It must be kept under\r\nstrict control. However strong a boiler may be, it will burst if the\r\nsteam pressure in it be raised to a certain point; and some device must\r\ntherefore be fitted on it which will give the steam free egress before\r\nthat point is reached. A device of this kind is called a _safety-valve_.\r\nIt usually blows off at less than half the greatest pressure that the\r\nboiler has been proved by experiment to be capable of withstanding.\r\n\r\nIn principle the safety-valve denotes an orifice closed by an\r\naccurately-fitting plug, which is pressed against its seat on the boiler\r\ntop by a weighted lever, or by a spring. As soon as the steam pressure\r\non the face of the plug exceeds the counteracting force of the weight\r\nor spring, the plug rises, and steam escapes until equilibrium of the\r\nopposing forces is restored.\r\n\r\nOn stationary engines a lever safety-valve is commonly employed (Fig.\r\n11). The blowing-off point can be varied by shifting the weight along\r\nthe arm so as to give it a greater or less leverage. On locomotive and\r\nmarine boilers, where shocks and movements have to be reckoned with,\r\nweights are replaced by springs, set to a certain tension, and locked up\r\nso that they cannot be tampered with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--A LEVER SAFETY-VALVE. V, valve; S, seating; P,\r\npin; L, lever; F, fulcrum; W, weight. The figures indicate the positions\r\nat which the weight should be placed for the valve to act when the\r\npressure rises to that number of pounds per square inch.]\r\n\r\nBoilers are tested by filling the boilers quite full and (1) by heating\r\nthe water, which expands slightly, but with great pressure; (2) by\r\nforcing in additional water with a powerful pump. In either case a\r\nrupture would not be attended by an explosion, as water is very\r\ninelastic.\r\n\r\nThe days when an engineer could \"sit on the valves\"--that is, screw them\r\ndown--to obtain greater pressure, are now past, and with them a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the dangers of high-pressure steam. The\r\nFactory Act of 1895, in force throughout the British Isles, provides\r\nthat every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop where\r\nthe Act applies must have a proper safety-valve, steam-gauge, and\r\nwater-gauge; and that boilers and fittings must be examined by a\r\ncompetent person at least once in every fourteen months. Neglect of\r\nthese provisions renders the owner of a boiler liable to heavy penalties\r\nif an explosion occurs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disastrous explosions on record took place at the Redcar\r\nIron Works, Yorkshire, in June 1895. In this case, twelve out of fifteen\r\nboilers ranged side by side burst, through one proving too weak for its\r\nwork. The flying fragments of this boiler, striking the sides of other\r\nboilers, exploded them, and so the damage was transmitted down the line.\r\nTwenty men were killed and injured; while masses of metal, weighing\r\nseveral tons each, were hurled 250 yards, and caused widespread damage.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from a journal, dated December 22, 1895:\r\n\"_Providence_ (_Rhode Island_).--A recent prophecy that a boiler would\r\nexplode between December 16 and 24 in a store has seriously affected the\r\nChristmas trade. Shoppers are incredibly nervous. One store advertises,\r\n'No boilers are being used; lifts running electrically.' All stores have\r\nhad their boilers inspected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER-GAUGE.\r\n\r\nNo fitting of a boiler is more important than the _water-gauge_, which\r\nshows the level at which the water stands. The engineer must continually\r\nconsult his gauge, for if the water gets too low, pipes and other\r\nsurfaces exposed to the furnace flames may burn through, with disastrous\r\nresults; while, on the other hand, too much water will cause bad\r\nsteaming. A section of an ordinary gauge is seen in Fig. 12. It consists\r\nof two parts, each furnished with a gland, G, to make a steam-tight\r\njoint round the glass tube, which is inserted through the hole covered\r\nby the plug P^1. The cocks T^1 T^2 are normally open, allowing the\r\ningress of steam and water respectively to the tube. Cock T^3 is kept\r\nclosed unless for any reason it is necessary to blow steam or water\r\nthrough the gauge. The holes C C can be cleaned out if the plugs P^2\r\nP^3 are removed.\r\n\r\nMost gauges on high-pressure boilers have a thick glass screen in front,\r\nso that in the event of the tube breaking, the steam and water may not\r\nblow directly on to the attendants. A further precaution is to include\r\ntwo ball-valves near the ends of the gauge-glass. Under ordinary\r\nconditions the balls lie in depressions clear of the ways; but when a\r\nrush of steam or water occurs they are sucked into their seatings and\r\nblock all egress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Section of a water-gauge.]\r\n\r\nOn many boilers two water-gauges are fitted, since any gauge may work\r\nbadly at times. The glasses are tested to a pressure of 3,000 lbs. or\r\nmore to the square inch before use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEAM-GAUGE.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that a person in charge of a boiler\r\nshould know what pressure the steam has reached. Every boiler is\r\ntherefore fitted with one _steam-gauge_; many with two, lest one might\r\nbe unreliable. There are two principal types of steam-gauge:--(1) The\r\nBourdon; (2) the Schäffer-Budenberg. The principle of the Bourdon is\r\nillustrated by Fig. 13, in which A is a piece of rubber tubing closed at\r\none end, and at the other drawn over the nozzle of a cycle tyre\r\ninflator. If bent in a curve, as shown, the section of the tube is an\r\noval. When air is pumped in, the rubber walls endeavour to assume a\r\ncircular section, because this shape encloses a larger area than an oval\r\nof equal circumference, and therefore makes room for a larger volume of\r\nair. In doing so the tube straightens itself, and assumes the position\r\nindicated by the dotted lines. Hang an empty \"inner tube\" of a pneumatic\r\ntyre over a nail and inflate it, and you will get a good illustration of\r\nthe principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Showing the principle of the steam-gauge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Bourdon steam-gauge. Part of dial removed to\r\nshow mechanism.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 14 we have a Bourdon gauge, with part of the dial face broken\r\naway to show the internal mechanism. T is a flattened metal tube\r\nsoldered at one end into a hollow casting, into which screws a tap\r\nconnected with the boiler. The other end (closed) is attached to a link,\r\nL, which works an arm of a quadrant rack, R, engaging with a small\r\npinion, P, actuating the pointer. As the steam pressure rises, the tube\r\nT moves its free end outwards towards the position shown by the dotted\r\nlines, and traverses the arm of the rack, so shifting the pointer round\r\nthe scale. As the pressure falls, the tube gradually returns to its zero\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe Schäffer-Budenberg gauge depends for its action on the elasticity of\r\na thin corrugated metal plate, on one side of which steam presses. As\r\nthe plate bulges upwards it pushes up a small rod resting on it, which\r\noperates a quadrant and rack similar to that of the Bourdon gauge. The\r\nprinciple is employed in another form for the aneroid barometer (p.\r\n329).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER SUPPLY TO A BOILER.\r\n\r\nThe water inside a boiler is kept at a proper level by (1) pumps or (2)\r\ninjectors. The former are most commonly used on stationary and marine\r\nboilers. As their mechanism is much the same as that of ordinary force\r\npumps, which will be described in a later chapter, we may pass at once\r\nto the _injector_, now almost universally used on locomotive, and\r\nsometimes on stationary boilers. At first sight the injector is a\r\nmechanical paradox, since it employs the steam from a boiler to blow\r\nwater into the boiler. In Fig. 15 we have an illustration of the\r\nprinciple of an injector. Steam is led from the boiler through pipe A,\r\nwhich terminates in a nozzle surrounded by a cone, E, connected by the\r\npipe B with the water tank. When steam is turned on it rushes with\r\nimmense velocity from the nozzle, and creates a partial vacuum in cone\r\nE, which soon fills with water. On meeting the water the steam\r\ncondenses, but not before it has imparted some of its _velocity_ to the\r\nwater, which thus gains sufficient momentum to force down the valve and\r\nfind its way to the boiler. The overflow space O O between E and C\r\nallows steam and water to escape until the water has gathered the\r\nrequisite momentum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Diagram illustrating the principle of a\r\nsteam-injector.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--The Giffard injector.]\r\n\r\nA form of injector very commonly used is Giffard's (Fig. 16). Steam is\r\nallowed to enter by screwing up the valve V. As it rushes through the\r\nnozzle of the cone A it takes up water and projects it into the \"mixing\r\ncone\" B, which can be raised or lowered by the pinion D (worked by the\r\nhand-wheel wheel shown) so as to regulate the amount of water admitted\r\nto B. At the centre of B is an aperture, O, communicating with the\r\noverflow. The water passes to the boiler through the valve on the left.\r\nIt will be noticed that the cone A and the part of B above the orifice O\r\ncontract downward. This is to convert the _pressure_ of the steam into\r\n_velocity_. Below O is a cone, the diameter of which increases\r\ndownwards. Here the _velocity_ of the water is converted back into\r\n_pressure_ in obedience to a well-known hydromechanic law.\r\n\r\nAn injector does not work well if the feed-water be too hot to condense\r\nthe steam quickly; and it may be taken as a rule that the warmer the\r\nwater, the smaller is the amount of it injected by a given weight of\r\nsteam.[2] Some injectors have flap-valves covering the overflow orifice,\r\nto prevent air being sucked in and carried to the boiler.\r\n\r\nWhen an injector receives a sudden shock, such as that produced by the\r\npassing of a locomotive over points, it is liable to \"fly off\"--that is,\r\nstop momentarily--and then send the steam and water through the\r\noverflow. If this happens, both steam and water must be turned off, and\r\nthe injector be restarted; unless it be of the _self-starting_ variety,\r\nwhich automatically controls the admission of water to the\r\n\"mixing-cone,\" and allows the injector to \"pick up\" of itself.\r\n\r\nFor economy's sake part of the steam expelled from the cylinders of a\r\nlocomotive is sometimes used to work an injector, which passes the water\r\non, at a pressure of 70 lbs. to the square inch, to a second injector\r\noperated by high-pressure steam coming direct from the boiler, which\r\nincreases its velocity sufficiently to overcome the boiler pressure. In\r\nthis case only a fraction of the weight of high-pressure steam is\r\nrequired to inject a given weight of water, as compared with that used\r\nin a single-stage injector.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"The Steam-Engine,\" p. 3.\r\n\r\n[2] By \"weight of steam\" is meant the steam produced by boiling a\r\ncertain weight of water. A pound of steam, if condensed, would form a\r\npound of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nTHE CONVERSION OF HEAT ENERGY INTO MECHANICAL MOTION.\r\n\r\n     Reciprocating engines--Double-cylinder engines--The function of the\r\n     fly-wheel--The cylinder--The slide-valve--The eccentric--\"Lap\" of\r\n     the valve: expansion of steam--How the cut-off is managed--Limit of\r\n     expansive working--Compound engines--Arrangement of expansion\r\n     engines--Compound locomotives--Reversing\r\n     gears--\"Linking-up\"--Piston-valves--Speed governors--Marine-speed\r\n     governors--The condenser.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving treated at some length the apparatus used for converting water\r\ninto high-pressure steam, we may pass at once to a consideration of the\r\nmechanisms which convert the energy of steam into mechanical motion, or\r\n_work_.\r\n\r\nSteam-engines are of two kinds:--(1) _reciprocating_, employing\r\ncylinders and cranks; (2) _rotary_, called turbines.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPROCATING ENGINES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Sketch showing parts of a horizontal\r\nsteam-engine.]\r\n\r\nFig. 17 is a skeleton diagram of the simplest form of reciprocating\r\nengine. C is a _cylinder_ to which steam is admitted through the\r\n_steam-ways_[3] W W, first on one side of the piston P, then on the\r\nother. The pressure on the piston pushes it along the cylinder, and the\r\nforce is transmitted through the piston rod P R to the _connecting rod_\r\nC R, which causes the _crank_ K to revolve. At the point where the two\r\nrods meet there is a \"crosshead,\" H, running to and fro in a guide to\r\nprevent the piston rod being broken or bent by the oblique thrusts and\r\npulls which it imparts through C R to the crank K. The latter is keyed\r\nto a _shaft_ S carrying the fly-wheel, or, in the case of a locomotive,\r\nthe driving-wheels. The crank shaft revolves in bearings. The internal\r\ndiameter of a cylinder is called its _bore_. The travel of the piston is\r\ncalled its _stroke_. The distance from the centre of the shaft to the\r\ncentre of the crank pin is called the crank's _throw_, which is half of\r\nthe piston's _stroke_. An engine of this type is called double-acting,\r\nas the piston is pushed alternately backwards and forwards by the steam.\r\nWhen piston rod, connecting rod, and crank lie in a straight line--that\r\nis, when the piston is fully out, or fully in--the crank is said to be\r\nat a \"dead point;\" for, were the crank turned to such a position, the\r\nadmission of steam would not produce motion, since the thrust or pull\r\nwould be entirely absorbed by the bearings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Sectional plan of a horizontal engine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE-CYLINDER ENGINES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nLocomotive, marine, and all other engines which must be started in any\r\nposition have at least _two_ cylinders, and as many cranks set at an\r\nangle to one another. Fig. 19 demonstrates that when one crank, C_1,\r\nof a double-cylinder engine is at a \"dead point,\" the other, C_2, has\r\nreached a position at which the piston exerts the maximum of turning\r\npower. In Fig. 20 each crank is at 45° with the horizontal, and both\r\npistons are able to do work. The power of one piston is constantly\r\nincreasing while that of the other is decreasing. If _single_-action\r\ncylinders are used, at least _three_ of these are needed to produce a\r\nperpetual turning movement, independently of a fly-wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUNCTION OF THE FLY-WHEEL.\r\n\r\nA fly-wheel acts as a _reservoir of energy_, to carry the crank of a\r\nsingle-cylinder engine past the \"dead points.\" It is useful in all\r\nreciprocating engines to produce steady running, as a heavy wheel acts\r\nas a drag on the effects of a sudden increase or decrease of steam\r\npressure. In a pump, mangold-slicer, cake-crusher, or chaff-cutter, the\r\nfly-wheel helps the operator to pass _his_ dead points--that is, those\r\nparts of the circle described by the handle in which he can do little\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CYLINDER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Diagrammatic section of a cylinder and its\r\nslide-valve.]\r\n\r\nThe cylinders of an engine take the place of the muscular system of the\r\nhuman body. In Fig. 21 we have a cylinder and its slide-valve shown in\r\nsection. First of all, look at P, the piston. Round it are white\r\ngrooves, R R, in which rings are fitted to prevent the passage of steam\r\npast the piston. The rings are cut through at one point in their\r\ncircumference, and slightly opened, so that when in position they press\r\nall round against the walls of the cylinder. After a little use they\r\n\"settle down to their work\"--that is, wear to a true fit in the\r\ncylinder. Each end of the cylinder is closed by a cover, one of which\r\nhas a boss cast on it, pierced by a hole for the piston rod to work\r\nthrough. To prevent the escape of steam the boss is hollowed out true to\r\naccommodate a _gland_, G^1, which is threaded on the rod and screwed\r\nup against the boss; the internal space between them being filled with\r\npacking. Steam from the boiler enters the steam-chest, and would have\r\naccess to both sides of the piston simultaneously through the\r\nsteam-ways, W W, were it not for the\r\n\r\n\r\nSLIDE-VALVE,\r\n\r\na hollow box open at the bottom, and long enough for its edges to cover\r\nboth steam-ways at once. Between W W is E, the passage for the exhaust\r\nsteam to escape by. The edges of the slide-valve are perfectly flat, as\r\nis the face over which the valve moves, so that no steam may pass under\r\nthe edges. In our illustration the piston has just begun to move towards\r\nthe right. Steam enters by the left steam-way, which the valve is just\r\ncommencing to uncover. As the piston moves, the valve moves in the same\r\ndirection until the port is fully uncovered, when it begins to move back\r\nagain; and just before the piston has finished its stroke the steam-way\r\non the right begins to open. The steam-way on the left is now in\r\ncommunication with the exhaust port E, so that the steam that has done\r\nits duty is released and pressed from the cylinder by the piston.\r\n_Reciprocation_ is this backward and forward motion of the piston: hence\r\nthe term \"reciprocating\" engines. The linear motion of the piston rod is\r\nconverted into rotatory motion by the connecting rod and crank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Perspective section of cylinder.]\r\n\r\nThe use of a crank appears to be so obvious a method of producing this\r\nconversion that it is interesting to learn that, when James Watt\r\nproduced his \"rotative engine\" in 1780 he was unable to use the crank\r\nbecause it had already been patented by one Matthew Wasborough. Watt was\r\nnot easily daunted, however, and within a twelvemonth had himself\r\npatented five other devices for obtaining rotatory motion from a piston\r\nrod. Before passing on, it may be mentioned that Watt was the father of\r\nthe modern--that is, the high-pressure--steam-engine; and that, owing to\r\nthe imperfection of the existing machinery, the difficulties he had to\r\novercome were enormous. On one occasion he congratulated himself because\r\none of his steam-cylinders was only three-eighths of an inch out of\r\ntruth in the bore. Nowadays a good firm would reject a cylinder 1/500 of\r\nan inch out of truth; and in small petrol-engines 1/5000 of an inch is\r\nsometimes the greatest \"limit of error\" allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--The eccentric and its rod.]\r\n\r\nTHE ECCENTRIC\r\n\r\nis used to move the slide-valve to and fro over the steam ports (Fig.\r\n23). It consists of three main parts--the _sheave_, or circular plate S,\r\nmounted on the crank shaft; and the two _straps_ which encircle it, and\r\nin which it revolves. To one strap is bolted the \"big end\" of the\r\neccentric rod, which engages at its other end with the valve rod. The\r\nstraps are semicircular and held together by strong bolts, B B, passing\r\nthrough lugs, or thickenings at the ends of the semicircles. The sheave\r\nhas a deep groove all round the edges, in which the straps ride. The\r\n\"eccentricity\" or \"throw\" of an eccentric is the distance between C^2,\r\nthe centre of the shaft, and C^1, the centre of the sheave. The throw\r\nmust equal half of the distance which the slide-valve has to travel over\r\nthe steam ports. A tapering steel wedge or key, K, sunk half in the\r\neccentric and half in a slot in the shaft, holds the eccentric steady\r\nand prevents it slipping. Some eccentric sheaves are made in two parts,\r\nbolted together, so that they may be removed easily without dismounting\r\nthe shaft.\r\n\r\nThe eccentric is in principle nothing more than a crank pin so\r\nexaggerated as to be larger than the shaft of the crank. Its convenience\r\nlies in the fact that it may be mounted at any point on a shaft, whereas\r\na crank can be situated at an end only, if it is not actually a V-shaped\r\nbend in the shaft itself--in which case its position is of course\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTING OF THE SLIDE-VALVE AND ECCENTRIC.\r\n\r\nThe subject of valve-setting is so extensive that a full exposition\r\nmight weary the reader, even if space permitted its inclusion. But\r\ninasmuch as the effectiveness of a reciprocating engine depends largely\r\non the nature and arrangement of the valves, we will glance at some of\r\nthe more elementary principles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 24 we see in section the slide-valve, the ports of the cylinder,\r\nand part of the piston. To the right are two lines at right angles--the\r\nthicker, C, representing the position of the crank; the thinner, E, that\r\nof the eccentric. (The position of an eccentric is denoted\r\ndiagrammatically by a line drawn from the centre of the crank shaft\r\nthrough the centre of the sheave.) The edges of the valve are in this\r\ncase only broad enough to just cover the ports--that is, they have no\r\n_lap_. The piston is about to commence its stroke towards the left; and\r\nthe eccentric, which is set at an angle of 90° in _advance_ of the\r\ncrank, is about to begin opening the left-hand port. By the time that C\r\nhas got to the position originally occupied by E, E will be horizontal\r\n(Fig. 25)--that is, the eccentric will have finished its stroke towards\r\nthe left; and while C passes through the next right angle the valve will\r\nbe closing the left port, which will cease to admit steam when the\r\npiston has come to the end of its travel. The operation is repeated on\r\nthe right-hand side while the piston returns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed here--(1) that steam is admitted at full pressure\r\n_all through_ the stroke; (2) that admission begins and ends\r\nsimultaneously with the stroke. Now, in actual practice it is necessary\r\nto admit steam before the piston has ended its travel, so as to\r\n_cushion_ the violence of the sudden change of direction of the piston,\r\nits rod, and other moving parts. To effect this, the eccentric is set\r\nmore than 90° in advance--that is, more than what the engineers call\r\n_square_. Fig. 26 shows such an arrangement. The angle between E and\r\nE^1 is called the _angle of advance_. Referring to the valve, you will\r\nsee that it has opened an appreciable amount, though the piston has not\r\nyet started on its rightwards journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LAP\" OF THE VALVE--EXPANSION OF STEAM.\r\n\r\nIn the simple form of valve that appears in Fig. 24, the valve faces are\r\njust wide enough to cover the steam ports. If the eccentric is not\r\n_square_ with the crank, the admission of steam lasts until the very end\r\nof the stroke; if set a little in advance--that is, given _lead_--the\r\nsteam is cut off before the piston has travelled quite along the\r\ncylinder, and readmitted before the back stroke is accomplished. Even\r\nwith this lead the working is very uneconomical, as the steam goes to\r\nthe exhaust at practically the same pressure as that at which it entered\r\nthe cylinder. Its property of _expansion_ has been neglected. But\r\nsupposing that steam at 100 lbs. pressure were admitted till\r\nhalf-stroke, and then suddenly cut off, the expansive nature of the\r\nsteam would then continue to push the piston out until the pressure had\r\ndecreased to 50 lbs. per square inch, at which pressure it would go to\r\nthe exhaust. Now, observe that all the work done by the steam after the\r\ncut-off is so much power saved. The _average_ pressure on the piston is\r\nnot so high as in the first case; still, from a given volume of 100 lbs.\r\npressure steam we get much more _work_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE CUT-OFF IS MANAGED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--A slide-valve with \"lap.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nLook at Fig. 27. Here we have a slide-valve, with faces much wider than\r\nthe steam ports. The parts marked black, P P, are those corresponding to\r\nthe faces of the valves shown in previous diagrams (p. 54). The shaded\r\nparts, L L, are called the _lap_. By increasing the length of the lap we\r\nincrease the range of expansive working. Fig. 28 shows the piston full\r\nto the left; the valve is just on the point of opening to admit steam\r\nbehind the piston. The eccentric has a throw equal to the breadth of a\r\nport + the lap of the valve. That this must be so is obvious from a\r\nconsideration of Fig. 27, where the valve is at its central position.\r\nHence the very simple formula:--Travel of valve = 2 × (lap + breadth of\r\nport). The path of the eccentric's centre round the centre of the shaft\r\nis indicated by the usual dotted line (Fig. 28). You will notice that\r\nthe \"angle of advance,\" denoted by the arrow A, is now very\r\nconsiderable. By the time that the crank C has assumed the position of\r\nthe line S, the eccentric has passed its dead point, and the valve\r\nbegins to travel backwards, eventually returning to the position shown\r\nin Fig. 28, and cutting off the steam supply while the piston has still\r\na considerable part of its stroke to make. The steam then begins to work\r\nexpansively, and continues to do so until the valve assumes the position\r\nshown in Fig. 27.\r\n\r\nIf the valve has to have \"lead\" to admit steam _before_ the end of the\r\nstroke to the other side of the piston, the _angle of advance_ must be\r\nincreased, and the eccentric centre line would lie on the line E^2.\r\nTherefore--total angle of advance = angle for _lap_ and angle for\r\n_lead_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMIT OF EXPANSIVE WORKING.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, by increasing the _lap_ and cutting off the steam earlier\r\nand earlier in the stroke, we should economize our power more and more.\r\nBut in practice a great difficulty is met with--namely, that _as the\r\nsteam expands its temperature falls_. If the cut-off occurs early, say\r\nat one-third stroke, the great expansion will reduce the temperature of\r\nthe metal walls of the cylinder to such an extent, that when the next\r\nspirt of steam enters from the other end a considerable proportion of\r\nthe steam's energy will be lost by cooling. In such a case, the\r\ndifference in temperature between admitted steam and exhausted steam is\r\ntoo great for economy. Yet we want to utilize as much energy as\r\npossible. How are we to do it?\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND ENGINES.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1853, John Elder, founder of the shipping firm of Elder and\r\nCo., Glasgow, introduced the _compound_ engine for use on ships. The\r\nsteam, when exhausted from the high-pressure cylinder, passed into\r\nanother cylinder of equal stroke but larger diameter, where the\r\nexpansion continued. In modern engines the expansion is extended to\r\nthree and even four stages, according to the boiler pressure; for it is\r\na rule that the higher the initial pressure is, the larger is the number\r\nof stages of expansion consistent with economical working.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Sketch of the arrangement of a\r\ntriple-expansion marine engine. No valve gear or supports, etc., shown.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 29 we have a triple-expansion marine engine. Steam enters the\r\nhigh-pressure cylinder[4] at, say, 200 lbs. per square inch. It exhausts\r\nat 75 lbs. into the large pipe 2, and passes to the intermediate\r\ncylinder, whence it is exhausted at 25 lbs. or so through pipe 3 to the\r\nlow-pressure cylinder. Finally, it is ejected at about 8 lbs. per square\r\ninch to the condenser, and is suddenly converted into water; an act\r\nwhich produces a vacuum, and diminishes the back-pressure of the exhaust\r\nfrom cylinder C. In fact, the condenser exerts a _sucking_ power on the\r\nexhaust side of C's piston.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF EXPANSION ENGINES.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration the cranks are set at angles of 120°, or a third of\r\na circle, so that one or other is always at or near the position of\r\nmaximum turning power. Where only two stages are used the cylinders are\r\noften arranged _tandem_, both pistons having a common piston rod and\r\ncrank. In order to get a constant turning movement they must be mounted\r\nseparately, and work cranks set at right angles to one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND LOCOMOTIVES.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Mr. A. Mallet introduced _compounding_ in locomotives; and the\r\npractice has been largely adopted. The various types of \"compounds\" may\r\nbe classified as follows:--(1) One low-pressure and one high-pressure\r\ncylinder; (2) one high-pressure and two low-pressure; (3) one\r\nlow-pressure and two high-pressure; (4) two high-pressure and two\r\nlow-pressure. The last class is very widely used in France, America, and\r\nRussia, and seems to give the best results. Where only two cylinders are\r\nused (and sometimes in the case of three and four), a valve arrangement\r\npermits the admission of high-pressure steam to both high and\r\nlow-pressure cylinders for starting a train, or moving it up heavy\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSING GEARS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 30, 31, 32.--Showing how a reversing gear alters\r\nthe position of the slide-valve.]\r\n\r\nThe engines of a locomotive or steamship must be reversible--that is,\r\nwhen steam is admitted to the cylinders, the engineer must be able to\r\nso direct it through the steam-ways that the cranks may turn in the\r\ndesired direction. The commonest form of reversing device (invented by\r\nGeorge Stephenson) is known as Stephenson's Link Gear. In Fig. 30 we\r\nhave a diagrammatic presentment of this gear. E^1 and E^2 are two\r\neccentrics set square with the crank at opposite ends of a diameter.\r\nTheir rods are connected to the ends of a link, L, which can be raised\r\nand lowered by means of levers (not shown). B is a block which can\r\npartly revolve on a pin projecting from the valve rod, working through\r\na guide, G. In Fig. 31 the link is half raised, or in \"mid-gear,\" as\r\ndrivers say. Eccentric E^1 has pushed the lower end of the link fully\r\nback; E^2 has pulled it fully forward; and since any movement of the\r\none eccentric is counterbalanced by the opposite movement of the other,\r\nrotation of the eccentrics would not cause the valve to move at all, and\r\nno steam could be admitted to the cylinder.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that Fig. 30 denotes one cylinder, crank, rods, etc., of\r\na locomotive. The crank has come to rest at its half-stroke; the\r\nreversing lever is at the mid-gear notch. If the engineer desires to\r\nturn his cranks in an anti-clockwise direction, he _raises_ the link,\r\nwhich brings the rod of E^1 into line with the valve rod and presses\r\nthe block _backwards_ till the right-hand port is uncovered (Fig. 31).\r\nIf steam be now admitted, the piston will be pushed towards the left,\r\nand the engine will continue to run in an anti-clockwise direction. If,\r\non the other hand, he wants to run the engine the other way, he would\r\n_drop_ the link, bringing the rod of E^2 into line with the valve rod,\r\nand drawing V _forward_ to uncover the rear port (Fig. 32). In either\r\ncase the eccentric working the end of the link remote from B has no\r\neffect, since it merely causes that end to describe arcs of circles of\r\nwhich B is the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LINKING UP.\"\r\n\r\nIf the link is only partly lowered or raised from the central position\r\nit still causes the engine to run accordingly, but the movement of the\r\nvalve is decreased. When running at high speed the engineer \"links up\"\r\nhis reversing gear, causing his valves to cut off early in the stroke,\r\nand the steam to work more expansively than it could with the lever at\r\n_full_, or _end_, gear; so that this device not only renders an engine\r\nreversible, but also gives the engineer an absolute command over the\r\nexpansion ratio of the steam admitted to the cylinder, and furnishes a\r\nmethod of cutting off the steam altogether. In Figs. 30, 31, 32, the\r\nvalve has no lap and the eccentrics are set square. In actual practice\r\nthe valve faces would have \"lap\" and the eccentric \"lead\" to correspond;\r\nbut for the sake of simplicity neither is shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER GEARS.\r\n\r\nIn the Gooch gear for reversing locomotives the link does not shift, but\r\nthe valve rod and its block is raised or lowered. The Allan gear is so\r\narranged that when the link is raised the block is lowered, and _vice\r\nversâ_. These are really only modifications of Stephenson's\r\nprinciple--namely, the employment of _two_ eccentrics set at equal\r\nangles to and on opposite sides of the crank. There are three other\r\nforms of link-reversing gear, and nearly a dozen types of _radial_\r\nreversing devices; but as we have already described the three most\r\ncommonly used on locomotives and ships, there is no need to give\r\nparticulars of these.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of Stephenson's gear a single eccentric was used\r\nfor each cylinder, and to reverse the engine this eccentric had to be\r\nloose on the axle. \"A lever and gear worked by a treadle on the\r\nfootplate controlled the position of the eccentrics. When starting the\r\nengine, the driver put the eccentrics out of gear by the treadle; then,\r\nby means of a lever he raised the small-ends[5] of the eccentric rods,\r\nand, noting the position of the cranks, or, if more convenient, the\r\nbalance weight in the wheels, he, by means of another handle, moved the\r\nvalves to open the necessary ports to steam and worked them by hand\r\nuntil the engine was moving; then, with the treadle, he threw the\r\neccentrics over to engage the studs, at the same time dropping the\r\nsmall-ends of the rods to engage pins upon the valve spindles, so that\r\nthey continued to keep up the movement of the valve.\"[6] One would\r\nimagine that in modern shunting yards such a device would somewhat delay\r\noperations!\r\n\r\n\r\nPISTON VALVES.\r\n\r\nIn marine engines, and on many locomotives and some stationary engines,\r\nthe D-valve (shown in Figs. 30-32) is replaced by a piston valve, or\r\ncircular valve, working up and down in a tubular seating. It may best be\r\ndescribed as a rod carrying two pistons which correspond to the faces of\r\na D-valve. Instead of rectangular ports there are openings in the tube\r\nin which the piston valve moves, communicating with the steam-ways into\r\nthe cylinder and with the exhaust pipe. In the case of the D-valve the\r\npressure above it is much greater than that below, and considerable\r\nfriction arises if the rubbing faces are not kept well lubricated. The\r\npiston valve gets over this difficulty, since such steam as may leak\r\npast it presses on its circumference at all points equally.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEED GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--A speed governor.]\r\n\r\nPractically all engines except locomotives and those known as\r\n\"donkey-engines\"--used on cranes--are fitted with some device for\r\nkeeping the rotatory speed of the crank constant within very narrow\r\nlimits. Perhaps you have seen a pair of balls moving round on a seating\r\nover the boiler of a threshing-engine. They form part of the \"governor,\"\r\nor speed-controller, shown in principle in Fig. 33. A belt driven by a\r\npulley on the crank shaft turns a small pulley, P, at the foot of the\r\ngovernor. This transmits motion through two bevel-wheels, G, to a\r\nvertical shaft, from the top of which hang two heavy balls on links, K\r\nK. Two more links, L L, connect the balls with a weight, W, which has a\r\ndeep groove cut round it at the bottom. When the shaft revolves, the\r\nballs fly outwards by centrifugal force, and as their velocity increases\r\nthe quadrilateral figure contained by the four links expands laterally\r\nand shortens vertically. The angles between K K and L L become less and\r\nless obtuse, and the weight W is drawn upwards, bringing with it the\r\nfork C of the rod A, which has ends engaging with the groove. As C\r\nrises, the other end of the rod is depressed, and the rod B depresses\r\nrod O, which is attached to the spindle operating a sort of shutter in\r\nthe steam-pipe. Consequently the supply of steam is throttled more and\r\nmore as the speed increases, until it has been so reduced that the\r\nengine slows, and the balls fall, opening the valve again. Fig. 34 shows\r\nthe valve fully closed. This form of governor was invented by James\r\nWatt. A spring is often used instead of a weight, and the governor is\r\narranged horizontally so that it may be driven direct from the crank\r\nshaft without the intervention of bevel gearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\nThe Hartwell governor employs a link motion. You must here picture the\r\nballs raising and lowering the _free end_ of the valve rod, which\r\ncarries a block moving in a link connected with the eccentric rod. The\r\nlink is pivoted at the upper end, and the eccentric rod is attached to\r\nthe lower. When the engine is at rest the end of the valve rod and its\r\nblock are dropped till in a line with the eccentric rod; but when the\r\nmachinery begins to work the block is gradually drawn up by the\r\ngovernor, diminishing the movement of the valve, and so shortening the\r\nperiod of steam admission to the cylinder.\r\n\r\nGovernors are of special importance where the _load_ of an engine is\r\nconstantly varying, as in the case of a sawmill. A good governor will\r\nlimit variation of speed within two per cent.--that is, if the engine is\r\nset to run at 100 revolutions a minute, it will not allow it to exceed\r\n101 or fall below 99. In _very_ high-speed engines the governing will\r\nprevent variation of less than one per cent., even when the load is at\r\none instant full on, and the next taken completely off.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINE GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\nThese must be more quick-acting than those used on engines provided with\r\nfly-wheels, which prevent very sudden variations of speed. The screw is\r\nlight in proportion to the engine power, and when it is suddenly raised\r\nfrom the water by the pitching of the vessel, the engine would race till\r\nthe screw took the water again, unless some regulating mechanism were\r\nprovided. Many types of marine governors have been tried. The most\r\nsuccessful seems to be one in which water is being constantly forced by\r\na pump driven off the engine shaft into a cylinder controlling a\r\nthrottle-valve in the main steam-pipe. The water escapes through a leak,\r\nwhich is adjustable. As long as the speed of the engine is normal, the\r\nwater escapes from the cylinder as fast as it is pumped in, and no\r\nmovement of the piston results; but when the screw begins to race, the\r\npump overcomes the leak, and the piston is driven out, causing a\r\nthrottling of the steam supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDENSERS.\r\n\r\nThe _condenser_ serves two purposes:--(1) It makes it possible to use\r\nthe same water over and over again in the boilers. On the sea, where\r\nfresh water is not obtainable in large quantities, this is a matter of\r\nthe greatest importance. (2) It adds to the power of a compound engine\r\nby exerting a back pull on the piston of the low-pressure cylinder while\r\nthe steam is being exhausted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--The marine condenser.]\r\n\r\nFig. 35 is a sectional illustration of a marine condenser. Steam enters\r\nthe condenser through the large pipe E, and passes among a number of\r\nvery thin copper tubes, through which sea-water is kept circulating by a\r\npump. The path of the water is shown by the featherless arrows. It comes\r\nfrom the pump through pipe A into the lower part of a large cap covering\r\none end of the condenser and divided transversely by a diaphragm, D.\r\nPassing through the pipes, it reaches the cap attached to the other end,\r\nand flows back through the upper tubes to the outlet C. This arrangement\r\nensures that, as the steam condenses, it shall meet colder and colder\r\ntubes, and finally be turned to water, which passes to the well through\r\nthe outlet F. In some condensers the positions of steam and water are\r\nreversed, steam going through the tubes outside which cold water\r\ncirculates.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Also called _ports_.\r\n\r\n[4] The bores of the cylinders are in the proportion of 4: 6: 9. The\r\nstroke of all three is the same.\r\n\r\n[5] The ends furthest from the eccentric.\r\n\r\n[6] \"The Locomotive of To-day,\" p. 87.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nTHE STEAM TURBINE.\r\n\r\n     How a turbine works--The De Laval turbine--The Parsons\r\n     turbine--Description of the Parsons turbine--The expansive action\r\n     of steam in a Parsons turbine--Balancing the thrust--Advantages of\r\n     the marine turbine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than two thousand years ago Hero of Alexandria produced the first\r\napparatus to which the name of steam-engine could rightly be given. Its\r\nprinciple was practically the same as that of the revolving jet used to\r\nsprinkle lawns during dry weather, steam being used in the place of\r\nwater. From the top of a closed cauldron rose two vertical pipes, which\r\nat their upper ends had short, right-angle bends. Between them was hung\r\na hollow globe, pivoted on two short tubes projecting from its sides\r\ninto the upright tubes. Two little L-shaped pipes projected from\r\nopposite sides of the globe, at the ends of a diameter, in a plane\r\nperpendicular to the axis. On fire being applied to the cauldron, steam\r\nwas generated. It passed up through the upright, through the pivots, and\r\ninto the globe, from which it escaped by the two L-shaped nozzles,\r\ncausing rapid revolution of the ball. In short, the first steam-engine\r\nwas a turbine. Curiously enough, we have reverted to this primitive type\r\n(scientifically developed, of course) in the most modern engineering\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW A TURBINE WORKS.\r\n\r\nIn reciprocating--that is, cylinder--engines steam is admitted into a\r\nchamber and the door shut behind it, as it were. As it struggles to\r\nexpand, it forces out one of the confining walls--that is, the\r\npiston--and presently the door opens again, and allows it to escape when\r\nit has done its work. In Hero's toy the impact of the issuing molecules\r\nagainst other molecules that have already emerged from the pipes was\r\nused. One may compare the reaction to that exerted by a thrown stone on\r\nthe thrower. If the thrower is standing on skates, the reaction of the\r\nstone will cause him to glide backwards, just as if he had pushed off\r\nfrom some fixed object. In the case of the _reaction_--namely, the\r\nHero-type--turbine the nozzle from which the steam or water issues\r\nmoves, along with bodies to which it may be attached. In _action_\r\nturbines steam is led through fixed nozzles or steam-ways, and the\r\nmomentum of the steam is brought to bear on the surfaces of movable\r\nbodies connected with the shaft.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DE LAVAL TURBINE.\r\n\r\nIn its earliest form this turbine was a modification of Hero's. The\r\nwheel was merely a pipe bent in S form, attached at its centre to a\r\nhollow vertical shaft supplied with steam through a stuffing-box at one\r\nextremity. The steam blew out tangentially from the ends of the S,\r\ncausing the shaft to revolve rapidly and work the machinery (usually a\r\ncream separator) mounted on it. This motor proved very suitable for\r\ndairy work, but was too wasteful of steam to be useful where high power\r\nwas needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--The wheel and nozzles of a De Laval turbine.]\r\n\r\nIn the De Laval turbine as now constructed the steam is blown from\r\nstationary nozzles against vanes mounted on a revolving wheel. Fig. 36\r\nshows the nozzles and a turbine wheel. The wheel is made as a solid\r\ndisc, to the circumference of which the vanes are dovetailed separately\r\nin a single row. Each vane is of curved section, the concave side\r\ndirected towards the nozzles, which, as will be gathered from the\r\n\"transparent\" specimen on the right of our illustration, gradually\r\nexpand towards the mouth. This is to allow the expansion of the steam,\r\nand a consequent gain of velocity. As it issues, each molecule strikes\r\nagainst the concave face of a vane, and, while changing its direction,\r\nis robbed of its kinetic energy, which passes to the wheel. To turn\r\nonce more to a stone-throwing comparison, it is as if a boy were pelting\r\nthe wheel with an enormous number of tiny stones. Now, escaping\r\nhigh-pressure steam moves very fast indeed. To give figures, if it\r\nenters the small end of a De Laval nozzle at 200 lbs. per square inch,\r\nit will leave the big end at a velocity of 48 miles per _minute_--that\r\nis, at a speed which would take it right round the world in 8-1/2 hours!\r\nThe wheel itself would not move at more than about one-third of this\r\nspeed as a maximum.[7] But even so, it may make as many as 30,000\r\nrevolutions per minute. A mechanical difficulty is now\r\nencountered--namely, that arising from vibration. No matter how\r\ncarefully the turbine wheel may be balanced, it is practically\r\nimpossible to make its centre of gravity coincide exactly with the\r\ncentral point of the shaft; in other words, the wheel will be a\r\nbit--perhaps only a tiny fraction of an ounce--heavier on one side than\r\nthe other. This want of truth causes vibration, which, at the high speed\r\nmentioned, would cause the shaft to knock the bearings in which it\r\nrevolves to pieces, if--and this is the point--those bearings were close\r\nto the wheel M. de Laval mounted the wheel on a shaft long enough\r\nbetween the bearings to \"whip,\" or bend a little, and the difficulty was\r\nsurmounted.\r\n\r\nThe normal speed of the turbine wheel is too high for direct driving of\r\nsome machinery, so it is reduced by means of gearing. To dynamos, pumps,\r\nand air-fans it is often coupled direct.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARSONS TURBINE.\r\n\r\nAt the grand naval review held in 1897 in honour of Queen Victoria's\r\ndiamond jubilee, one of the most noteworthy sights was the little\r\n_Turbinia_ of 44-1/2 tons burthen, which darted about among the floating\r\nforts at a speed much surpassing that of the fastest \"destroyer.\" Inside\r\nthe nimble little craft were engines developing 2,000 horse power,\r\nwithout any of the clank and vibration which usually reigns in the\r\nengine-room of a high-speed vessel. The _Turbinia_ was the first\r\nturbine-driven boat, and as such, even apart from her extraordinary\r\npace, she attracted great attention. Since 1897 the Parsons turbine has\r\nbeen installed on many ships, including several men-of-war, and it seems\r\nprobable that the time is not far distant when reciprocating engines\r\nwill be abandoned on all high-speed craft.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PARSONS TURBINE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Section of a Parsons turbine.]\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of a Parsons turbine are:--(1) The shaft, on which\r\nis mounted (2) the drum; (3) the cylindrical casing inside which the\r\ndrum revolves; (4) the vanes on the drum and casing; (5) the balance\r\npistons. Fig. 37 shows a diagrammatic turbine in section. The drum, it\r\nwill be noticed, increases its diameter in three stages, D^1, D^2,\r\nD^3, towards the right. From end to end it is studded with little\r\nvanes, M M, set in parallel rings small distances apart. Each vane has a\r\ncurved section (see Fig. 38), the hollow side facing towards the left.\r\nThe vanes stick out from the drum like short spokes, and their outer\r\nends almost touch the casing. To the latter are attached equally-spaced\r\nrings of fixed vanes, F F, pointing inwards towards the drum, and\r\noccupying the intervals between the rings of moving vanes. Their concave\r\nsides also face towards the left, but, as seen in Fig. 38, their line of\r\ncurve lies the reverse way to that of M M. Steam enters the casing at A,\r\nand at once rushes through the vanes towards the outlet at B. It meets\r\nthe first row of fixed vanes, and has its path so deflected that it\r\nstrikes the ring of moving (or drum) vanes at the most effective angle,\r\nand pushes them round. It then has its direction changed by the ring of\r\nF F, so that it may treat the next row of M M in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Blades or vanes of a Parsons turbine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the low-pressure turbines of the _Carmania_, in\r\ncasing. Its size will be inferred from comparison with the man standing\r\nnear the end of the casing.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXPANSIVE ACTION OF STEAM IN A TURBINE.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the end of D^1 it enters the second, or intermediate, set\r\nof vanes. The drum here is of a greater diameter, and the blades are\r\nlonger and set somewhat farther apart, to give a freer passage to the\r\nnow partly expanded steam, which has lost pressure but gained velocity.\r\nThe process of movement is repeated through this stage; and again in\r\nD^3, the low-pressure drum. The steam then escapes to the condenser\r\nthrough B, having by this time expanded very many times; and it is found\r\nadvisable, for reasons explained in connection with compound\r\nsteam-engines, to have a separate turbine in an independent casing for\r\nthe extreme stages of expansion.\r\n\r\nThe vanes are made of brass. In the turbines of the _Carmania_, the huge\r\nCunard liner, 1,115,000 vanes are used. The largest diameter of the\r\ndrums is 11 feet, and each low-pressure turbine weighs 350 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALANCING OF THRUST.\r\n\r\nThe push exerted by the steam on the blades not only turns the drum, but\r\npresses it in the direction in which the steam flows. This end thrust is\r\ncounterbalanced by means of the \"dummy\" pistons, P^1, P^2, P^3.\r\nEach dummy consists of a number of discs revolving between rings\r\nprojecting from the casing, the distance between discs and rings being\r\nso small that but little steam can pass. In the high-pressure\r\ncompartment the steam pushes P^1 to the left with the same pressure as\r\nit pushes the blades of D^1 to the right. After completing the first\r\nstage it fills the passage C, which communicates with the second piston,\r\nP^2, and the pressure on that piston negatives the thrust on D^2.\r\nSimilarly, the passage E causes the steam to press equally on P^3 and\r\nthe vanes of D^3. So that the bearings in which the shaft revolves\r\nhave but little thrust to take. This form of compensation is necessary\r\nin marine as well as in stationary turbines. In the former the dummy\r\npistons are so proportioned that the forward thrust given by them and\r\nthe screw combined is almost equal to the thrust aft of the moving\r\nvanes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the turbine drums of the _Carmania_. Note the\r\nrows of vanes. The drum is here being tested for perfect balance on two\r\nabsolutely level supports.]\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF THE MARINE TURBINE.\r\n\r\n(1.) Absence of vibration. Reciprocating engines, however well balanced,\r\ncause a shaking of the whole ship which is very unpleasant to\r\npassengers. The turbine, on the other hand, being almost perfectly\r\nbalanced, runs so smoothly at the highest speeds that, if the hand be\r\nlaid on the covering, it is sometimes almost impossible to tell whether\r\nthe machinery is in motion. As a consequence of this smooth running\r\nthere is little noise in the engine-room--a pleasant contrast to the\r\ndeafening roar of reciprocating engines. (2.) Turbines occupy less room.\r\n(3.) They are more easily tended. (4.) They require fewer repairs, since\r\nthe rubbing surfaces are very small as compared to those of\r\nreciprocating engines. (5.) They are more economical at high speeds. It\r\nmust be remembered that a turbine is essentially meant for high speeds.\r\nIf run slowly, the steam will escape through the many passages without\r\ndoing much work.\r\n\r\nOwing to its construction, a turbine cannot be reversed like a cylinder\r\nengine. It therefore becomes necessary to fit special astern turbines to\r\none or more of the screw shafts, for use when the ship has to be stopped\r\nor moved astern. Under ordinary conditions these turbines revolve idly\r\nin their cases.\r\n\r\nThe highest speed ever attained on the sea was the forty-two miles per\r\nhour of the unfortunate _Viper_, a turbine destroyer which developed\r\n11,500 horse power, though displacing only 370 tons. This velocity would\r\ncompare favourably with that of a good many expresses on certain\r\nrailways that we could name. In the future thirty miles an hour will\r\ncertainly be attained by turbine-driven liners.\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] Even at this speed the wheel has a circumferential velocity of\r\ntwo-thirds that of a bullet shot from a Lee-Metford rifle. A vane\r\nweighing only 250 grains (about 1/2 oz.) exerts under these conditions a\r\ncentrifugal pull of 15 cwt. on the wheel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINE.\r\n\r\n     The meaning of the term--Action of the internal-combustion\r\n     engine--The motor car--The starting-handle--The engine--The\r\n     carburetter--Ignition of the charge--Advancing the spark--Governing\r\n     the engine--The clutch--The gear-box--The compensating gear--The\r\n     silencer--The brakes--Speed of cars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEANING OF THE TERM \"INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINE.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of a steam-boiler the energy of combustion is transmitted to\r\nwater inside an air-tight vessel. The fuel does not actually touch the\r\n\"working fluid.\" In the gas or oil engine the fuel is brought into\r\ncontact and mixed with the working fluid, which is air. It combines\r\nsuddenly with it in the cylinder, and heat energy is developed so\r\nrapidly that the act is called an explosion. Coal gas, mineral oils,\r\nalcohol, petrol, etc., all contain hydrogen and carbon. If air, which\r\ncontributes oxygen, be added to any of these in due proportion, the\r\nmixture becomes highly explosive. On a light being applied, oxygen and\r\ncarbon unite, also hydrogen and oxygen, and violent heat is generated,\r\ncausing a violent molecular bombardment of the sides of the vessel\r\ncontaining the mixture. Now, if the mixture be _compressed_ it becomes\r\nhotter and hotter, until a point is reached at which it ignites\r\nspontaneously. Early gas-engines did not compress the charge before\r\nignition. Alphonse Beau de Rochas, a Frenchman, first thought of making\r\nthe piston of the engine squeeze the mixture before ignition; and from\r\nthe year 1862, when he proposed this innovation, the success of the\r\ninternal-combustion engine may be said to date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Showing the four strokes that the piston of a\r\ngas-engine makes during one \"cycle.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF THE ENGINE.\r\n\r\nThe gas-engine, the oil-engine, and the motor-car engine are similar in\r\ngeneral principles. The cylinder has, instead of a slide-valve, two, or\r\nsometimes three, \"mushroom\" valves, which may be described as small and\r\nthick round plates, with bevelled edges, mounted on the ends of short\r\nrods, called stems. These valves open into the cylinder, upwards,\r\ndownwards, or horizontally, as the case may be; being pushed in by cams\r\nprojecting from a shaft rotated by the engine. For the present we will\r\nconfine our attention to the series of operations which causes the\r\nengine to work. This series is called the Beau de Rochas, or Otto,\r\ncycle, and includes four movements of the piston. Reference to Fig. 39\r\nwill show exactly what happens in a gas-engine--(1) The piston moves\r\nfrom left to right, and just as the movement commences valves G (gas)\r\nand A (air) open to admit the explosive mixture. By the time that P has\r\nreached the end of its travel these valves have closed again. (2) The\r\npiston returns to the left, compressing the mixture, which has no way of\r\nescape open to it. At the end of the stroke the charge is ignited by an\r\nincandescent tube I (in motor car and some stationary engines by an\r\nelectric spark), and (3) the piston flies out again on the \"explosion\"\r\nstroke. Before it reaches the limit position, valve E (exhaust) opens,\r\nand (4) the piston flies back under the momentum of the fly-wheel,\r\ndriving out the burnt gases through the still open E. The \"cycle\" is now\r\ncomplete. There has been suction, compression (including ignition),\r\ncombustion, and exhaustion. It is evident that a heavy fly-wheel must be\r\nattached to the crank shaft, because the energy of one stroke (the\r\nexplosion) has to serve for the whole cycle; in other words, for two\r\ncomplete revolutions of the crank. A single-cylinder steam-engine\r\ndevelops an impulse every half-turn--that is, four times as often. In\r\norder to get a more constant turning effect, motor cars have two, three,\r\nfour, six, and even eight cylinders. Four-cylinder engines are at\r\npresent the most popular type for powerful cars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOTOR CAR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Plan of the chassis of a motor car.]\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to an examination of the motor car, which, in\r\naddition to mechanical apparatus for the transmission of motion to the\r\ndriving-wheels, includes all the fundamental adjuncts of the\r\ninternal-combustion engine.[8] Fig. 40 is a bird's-eye view of the\r\n_chassis_ (or \"works\" and wheels) of a car, from which the body has been\r\nremoved. Starting at the left, we have the handle for setting the\r\nengine in motion; the engine (a two-cylinder in this case); the\r\nfly-wheel, inside which is the clutch; the gear-box, containing the cogs\r\nfor altering the speed of revolution of the driving-wheels relatively to\r\nthat of the engine; the propeller shaft; the silencer, for deadening the\r\nnoise of the exhaust; and the bevel-gear, for turning the\r\ndriving-wheels. In the particular type of car here considered you will\r\nnotice that a \"direct,\" or shaft, drive is used. The shaft has at each\r\nend a flexible, or \"universal,\" joint, which allows the shaft to turn\r\nfreely, even though it may not be in a line with the shaft projecting\r\nfrom the gear-box. It must be remembered that the engine and gear-box\r\nare mounted on the frame, between which and the axles are springs, so\r\nthat when the car bumps up and down, the shaft describes part of a\r\ncircle, of which the gear-box end is the centre.\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of driving is by means of chains, which run round\r\nsprocket (cog) wheels on the ends of a shaft crossing the frame just\r\nbehind the gear-box, and round larger sprockets attached to the hubs of\r\nthe driving-wheels. In such a case the axles of the driving-wheel are\r\nfixed to the springs, and the wheels revolve round them. Where a Cardan\r\n(shaft) drive is used the axles are attached rigidly to the wheels at\r\none end, and extend, through tubes fixed to the springs, to bevel-wheels\r\nin a central compensating-gear box (of which more presently).\r\n\r\nSeveral parts--the carburetter, tanks, governor, and pump--are not shown\r\nin the general plan. These will be referred to in the more detailed\r\naccount that follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STARTING-HANDLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--The starting-handle.]\r\n\r\nFig. 41 gives the starting-handle in part section. The handle H is\r\nattached to a tube which terminates in a clutch, C. A powerful spring\r\nkeeps C normally apart from a second clutch, C^1, keyed to the engine\r\nshaft. When the driver wishes to start the engine he presses the handle\r\ntowards the right, brings the clutches together, and turns the handle in\r\na clockwise direction. As soon as the engine begins to fire, the faces\r\nof the clutches slip over one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGINE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--End and cross sections of a two-cylinder\r\nmotor.]\r\n\r\nWe next examine the two-cylinder engine (Fig. 42). Each cylinder is\r\nsurrounded by a water-jacket, through which water is circulated by a\r\npump[9] (Fig. 43). The heat generated by combustion is so great that the\r\nwalls of the cylinder would soon become red-hot unless some of the heat\r\nwere quickly carried away. The pistons are of \"trunk\" form--that is,\r\nlong enough to act as guides and absorb the oblique thrust of the piston\r\nrods. Three or more piston rings lying in slots (not shown) prevent the\r\nescape of gas past the piston. It is interesting to notice that the\r\nefficiency of an internal-combustion engine depends so largely on the\r\ngood fit of these moving parts, that cylinders, pistons, and rings must\r\nbe exceedingly true. A good firm will turn out standard parts which are\r\nwell within 1/5000 of an inch of perfect truth. It is also a wonderful\r\ntestimony to the quality of the materials used that, if properly looked\r\nafter, an engine which has made many millions of revolutions, at the\r\nrate of 1,000 to 2,000 per minute, often shows no appreciable signs of\r\nwear. In one particular test an engine was run _continuously for several\r\nmonths_, and at the end of the trial was in absolutely perfect\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe cranks revolve in an oil-tight case (generally made of aluminium),\r\nand dip in oil, which they splash up into the cylinder to keep the\r\npiston well lubricated. The plate, P P, through a slot in which the\r\npiston rod works, prevents an excess of oil being flung up. Channels are\r\nprovided for leading oil into the bearings. The cranks are 180° apart.\r\nWhile one piston is being driven out by an explosion, the other is\r\ncompressing its charge prior to ignition, so that the one action deadens\r\nthe other. Therefore two explosions occur in one revolution of the\r\ncranks, and none during the next revolution. If both cranks were in\r\nline, the pistons would move together, giving one explosion each\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Showing how the water which cools the cylinders\r\nis circulated.]\r\n\r\nThe valve seats, and the inlet and exhaust pipes, are seen in section.\r\nThe inlet valve here works automatically, being pulled in by suction;\r\nbut on many engines--on all powerful engines--the inlet, like the\r\nexhaust valve, is lifted by a cam, lest it should stick or work\r\nirregularly. Three dotted circles show A, a cog on the crank shaft; B, a\r\n\"lay\" cog, which transmits motion to C, on a short shaft rotating the\r\ncam that lifts the exhaust valve. C, having twice as many teeth as A,\r\nrevolves at half its rate. This ensures that the valve shall be lifted\r\nonly once in two revolutions of the crank shaft to which it is geared.\r\nThe cogs are timed, or arranged, so that the cam begins to lift the\r\nvalve when the piston has made about seven-eighths of its explosion\r\nstroke, and closes the valve at the end of the exhaust stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARBURETTER.\r\n\r\nA motor car generally uses petrol as its fuel. Petrol is one of the more\r\nvolatile products of petroleum, and has a specific gravity of about\r\n680--that is, volume for volume, its weight is to that of water in the\r\nproportion of 680 to 1,000. It is extremely dangerous, as it gives off\r\nan inflammable gas at ordinary temperatures. Benzine, which we use to\r\nclean clothes, is practically the same as petrol, and should be treated\r\nwith equal care. The function of a _carburetter_ is to reduce petrol to\r\na very fine spray and mix it with a due quantity of air. The device\r\nconsists of two main parts (Fig. 44)--the _float chamber_ and the _jet\r\nchamber_. In the former is a contrivance for regulating the petrol\r\nsupply. A float--a cork, or air-tight metal box--is arranged to move\r\nfreely up and down the stem of a needle-valve, which closes the inlet\r\nfrom the tank. At the bottom of the chamber are two pivoted levers, W W,\r\nwhich, when the float rests on them, tip up and lift the valve. Petrol\r\nflows in and raises the float. This allows the valve to sink and cut off\r\nthe supply. If the valve is a good fit and the float is of the correct\r\nweight, the petrol will never rise higher than the tip of the jet G.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Section of a carburetter.]\r\n\r\nThe suction of the engine makes petrol spirt through the jet (which has\r\na very small hole in its end) and atomize itself against a\r\nspraying-cone, A. It then passes to the engine inlet pipe through a\r\nnumber of openings, after mixing with air entering from below. An extra\r\nair inlet, controllable by the driver, is generally added, unless the\r\ncarburetter be of a type which automatically maintains constant\r\nproportions of air and vapour. The jet chamber is often surrounded by a\r\njacket, through which part of the hot exhaust gases circulate. In cold\r\nweather especially this is a valuable aid to vaporization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Sketch of the electrical ignition arrangements\r\non a motor car.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNITION OF THE CHARGE.\r\n\r\nAll petrol-cars now use electrical ignition. There are two main\r\nsystems--(1) by an accumulator and induction coil; (2) _magneto\r\nignition_, by means of a small dynamo driven by the engine. A general\r\narrangement of the first is shown in Fig. 45. A disc, D, of some\r\ninsulating material--fibre or vulcanite--is mounted on the cam, or\r\nhalf-speed, shaft. Into the circumference is let a piece of brass,\r\ncalled the contact-piece, through which a screw passes to the cam shaft.\r\nA movable plate, M P, which can be rotated concentrically with D through\r\npart of a circle, carries a \"wipe\" block at the end of a spring, which\r\npresses it against D. The spring itself is attached to an insulated\r\nplate. When the revolution of D brings the wipe and contact together,\r\ncurrent flows from the accumulator through switch S to the wipe; through\r\nthe contact-piece to C; from C to M P and the induction coil; and back\r\nto the accumulator. This is the _primary, or low-tension, circuit_. A\r\n_high-tension_ current is induced by the coil in the _secondary_\r\ncircuit, indicated by dotted lines.[10] In this circuit is the\r\nsparking-plug (see Fig. 46), having a central insulated rod in\r\nconnection with one terminal of the secondary coil. Between it and a\r\nbent wire projecting from the iron casing of the plug (in contact with\r\nthe other terminal of the secondary coil through the metal of the\r\nengine, to which one wire of the circuit is attached) is a small gap,\r\nacross which the secondary current leaps when the primary current is\r\nbroken by the wipe and contact parting company. The spark is intensely\r\nhot, and suffices to ignite the compressed charge in the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Section of a sparking-plug.]\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCING THE SPARK.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that the position of W (in Fig. 45) is such that the\r\ncontact touches W at the moment when the piston has just completed the\r\ncompression stroke. Now, the actual combustion of the charge occupies\r\nan appreciable time, and with the engine running at high speed the\r\npiston would have travelled some way down the cylinder before the full\r\nforce of the explosion was developed. But by raising lever L, the\r\nposition of W may be so altered that contact is made slightly _before_\r\nthe compression stroke is complete, so that the charge is fairly alight\r\nby the time the piston has altered its direction. This is called\r\n_advancing_ the spark.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNING THE ENGINE.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of controlling the speed of\r\ninternal-combustion engines. The operating mechanism in most cases is a\r\ncentrifugal ball-governor. When the speed has reached the fixed limit it\r\neither (1) raises the exhaust valve, so that no fresh charges are drawn\r\nin; (2) prevents the opening of the inlet valve; or (3) throttles the\r\ngas supply. The last is now most commonly used on motor cars, in\r\nconjunction with some device for putting it out of action when the\r\ndriver wishes to exceed the highest speed that it normally permits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--One form of governor used on motor cars.]\r\n\r\nA sketch of a neat governor, with regulating attachment, is given in\r\nFig. 47. The governor shaft is driven from the engine. As the balls, B\r\nB, increase their velocity, they fly away from the shaft and move the\r\narms, A A, and a sliding tube, C, towards the right. This rocks the\r\nlever R, and allows the valves in the inlet pipe to close and reduce the\r\nsupply of air and gas. A wedge, W, which can be raised or lowered by\r\nlever L, intervenes between the end of R and the valve stem. If this\r\nlever be lifted to its highest position, the governing commences at a\r\nlower speed, as the valve then has but a short distance to travel before\r\nclosing completely. For high speeds the driver depresses L, forces the\r\nwedge down, and so minimizes the effect of the governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLUTCH.\r\n\r\nThe engine shaft has on its rear end the fly-wheel, which has a broad\r\nand heavy rim, turned to a conical shape inside. Close to this,\r\nrevolving loosely on the shaft, is the clutch plate, a heavy disc with a\r\nbroad edge so shaped as to fit the inside of a fly-wheel. It is\r\ngenerally faced with leather. A very strong spring presses the plate\r\ninto the fly-wheel, and the resulting friction is sufficient to prevent\r\nany slip. Projections on the rear of the clutch engage with the gear-box\r\nshaft. The driver throws out the clutch by depressing a lever with his\r\nfoot. Some clutches dispense with the leather lining. These are termed\r\n_metal to metal_ clutches.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEAR-BOX.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a very interesting detail of the motor car, the gear-box.\r\nThe steam-engine has its speed increased by admitting more steam to the\r\ncylinders. But an explosion engine must be run at a high speed to\r\ndevelop its full power, and when heavier work has to be done on a hill\r\nit becomes necessary to alter the speed ratio of engine to\r\ndriving-wheels. Our illustration (Fig. 48) gives a section of a\r\ngear-box, which will serve as a typical example. It provides three\r\nforward speeds and one reverse. To understand how it works, we must\r\nstudy the illustration carefully. Pinion 1 is mounted on a hollow shaft\r\nturned by the clutch. Into the hollow shaft projects the end of another\r\nshaft carrying pinions 6 and 4. Pinion 6 slides up and down this shaft,\r\nwhich is square at this point, but round inside the _loose_ pinion 4.\r\nPinions 2 and 3 are keyed to a square secondary shaft, and are\r\nrespectively always in gear with 1 and 4; but 5 can be slid backwards\r\nand forwards so as to engage or disengage with 6. In the illustration no\r\ngear is \"in.\" If the engine is working, 1 revolves 2, 2 turns 3, and 3\r\nrevolves 4 idly on its shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--The gear-box of a motor car.]\r\n\r\nTo get the lowest, or \"first,\" speed the driver moves his lever and\r\nslides 5 into gear with 6. The transmission then is: 1 turns 2, 2 turns\r\n5, 5 turns 6, 6 turns the propeller shaft through the universal joint.\r\nFor the second speed, 5 and 6 are disengaged, and 6 is moved up the\r\npage, as it were, till projections on it interlock with slots in 4; thus\r\ndriving 1, 2, 3, 4, shaft. For the third, or \"solid,\" speed, 6 is pulled\r\ndown into connection with 1, and couples the engine shaft direct to the\r\npropeller shaft.\r\n\r\nThe \"reverse\" is accomplished by raising a long pinion, 7, which lies in\r\nthe gear-box under 5 and 6. The drive then is 1, 2, 5, 7, 6. There being\r\nan odd number of pinions now engaged, the propeller shaft turns in the\r\nreverse direction to that of the engine shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPENSATING GEAR.\r\n\r\nEvery axle of a railway train carries a wheel at each end, rigidly\r\nattached to it. When rounding a corner the outside wheel has further to\r\ntravel than the other, and consequently one or both wheels must slip.\r\nThe curves are made so gentle, however, that the amount of slip is very\r\nsmall. But with a traction-engine, motor car, or tricycle the case is\r\ndifferent, for all have to describe circles of very small diameter in\r\nproportion to the length of the vehicle. Therefore in every case a\r\n_compensating gear_ is fitted, to allow the wheels to turn at different\r\nspeeds, while permitting them both to drive. Fig. 49 is an exaggerated\r\nsketch of the gear. The axles of the moving wheels turn inside tubes\r\nattached to the springs and a central casing (not shown), and terminate\r\nin large bevel-wheels, C and D. Between these are small bevels mounted\r\non a shaft supported by the driving drum. If the latter be rotated, the\r\nbevels would turn C and D at equal speeds, assuming that both axles\r\nrevolve without friction in their bearings. We will suppose that the\r\ndrum is turned 50 times a minute. Now, if one wheel be held, the other\r\nwill revolve 100 times a minute; or, if one be slowed, the other will\r\nincrease its speed by a corresponding amount. The _average_ speed\r\nremains 50. It should be mentioned that drum A has incorporated with it\r\non the outside a bevel-wheel (not shown) rotated by a smaller bevel on\r\nthe end of the propeller shaft.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SILENCER.\r\n\r\nThe petrol-engine, as now used, emits the products of combustion at a\r\nhigh pressure. If unchecked, they expand violently, and cause a partial\r\nvacuum in the exhaust pipe, into which the air rushes back with such\r\nviolence as to cause a loud noise. Devices called _silencers_ are\r\ntherefore fitted, to render the escape more gradual, and split it up\r\namong a number of small apertures. The simplest form of silencer is a\r\ncylindrical box, with a number of finely perforated tubes passing from\r\nend to end of it. The exhaust gases pouring into the box maintain a\r\nconstant pressure somewhat higher than that of the atmosphere, but as\r\nthe gases are escaping from it in a fairly steady stream the noise\r\nbecomes a gentle hiss rather than a \"pop.\" There are numerous types of\r\nsilencers, but all employ this principle in one form or another.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRAKES.\r\n\r\nEvery car carries at least two brakes of band pattern--one, usually\r\nworked by a side hand-lever, acting on the axle or hubs of the\r\ndriving-wheel; the other, operated by the foot, acting on the\r\ntransmission gear (see Fig. 48). The latter brake is generally arranged\r\nto withdraw the clutch simultaneously. Tests have proved that even heavy\r\ncars can be pulled up in astonishingly short distances, considering\r\ntheir rate of travel. Trials made in the United States with a touring\r\ncar and a four-in-hand coach gave 25-1/3 and 70 feet respectively for\r\nthe distance in which the speed could be reduced from sixteen miles per\r\nhour to zero.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEED OF CARS.\r\n\r\nAs regards speed, motor cars can rival the fastest express trains, even\r\non long journeys. In fact, feats performed during the Gordon-Bennett and\r\nother races have equalled railway performances over equal distances.\r\nWhen we come to record speeds, we find a car, specially built for the\r\npurpose, covering a mile in less than half a minute. A speed of over 120\r\nmiles an hour has actually been reached. Engines of 150 h.p. can now be\r\npacked into a vehicle scaling less than 1-1/2 tons. Even on touring cars\r\nare often found engines developing 40 to 60 h.p., which force the car up\r\nsteep hills at a pace nothing less than astonishing. In the future the\r\nmotor car will revolutionize our modes of life to an extent comparable\r\nto the changes effected by the advent of the steam-engine. Even since\r\n1896, when the \"man-with-the-flag\" law was abolished in the British\r\nIsles, the motor has reduced distances, opened up country districts, and\r\ngenerally quickened the pulses of the community in a manner which makes\r\nit hazardous to prophesy how the next generation will live.\r\n\r\n_Note._--The author is much indebted to Mr. Wilfrid J. Lineham, M. Inst.\r\nC.E., for several of the illustrations which appear in the above\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] Steam-driven cars are not considered in this chapter, as their\r\nprinciple is much the same as that of the ordinary locomotive.\r\n\r\n[9] On some cars natural circulation is used, the hot water flowing from\r\nthe top of the cylinder to the tank, from which it returns, after being\r\ncooled, to the bottom of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[10] For explanation of the induction coil, see p. 122\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n     What is electricity?--Forms of electricity--Magnetism--The\r\n     permanent magnet--Lines of force--Electro-magnets--The electric\r\n     bell--The induction coil--The condenser--Transformation of\r\n     current--Uses of the induction coil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS ELECTRICITY?\r\n\r\nOf the ultimate nature of electricity, as of that of heat and light, we\r\nare at present ignorant. But it has been clearly established that all\r\nthree phenomena are but manifestations of the energy pervading the\r\nuniverse. By means of suitable apparatus one form can be converted into\r\nanother form. The heat of fuel burnt in a boiler furnace develops\r\nmechanical energy in the engine which the boiler feeds with steam. The\r\nengine revolves a dynamo, and the electric current thereby generated can\r\nbe passed through wires to produce mechanical motion, heat, or light. We\r\nmust remain content, therefore, with assuming that electricity is energy\r\nor motion transmitted through the ether from molecule to molecule, or\r\nfrom atom to atom, of matter. Scientific investigation has taught us how\r\nto produce it at will, how to harness it to our uses, and how to measure\r\nit; but not _what_ it is. That question may, perhaps, remain unanswered\r\ntill the end of human history. A great difficulty attending the\r\nexplanation of electrical action is this--that, except in one or two\r\ncases, no comparison can be established between it and the operation of\r\ngases and fluids. When dealing with the steam-engine, any ordinary\r\nintelligence soon grasps the principles which govern the use of steam in\r\ncylinders or turbines. The diagrams show, it is hoped, quite plainly\r\n\"how it works.\" But electricity is elusive, invisible; and the greatest\r\nauthorities cannot say what goes on at the poles of a magnet or on the\r\nsurface of an electrified body. Even the existence of \"negative\" and\r\n\"positive\" electricity is problematical. However, we see the effects,\r\nand we know that if one thing is done another thing happens; so that we\r\nare at least able to use terms which, while convenient, are not at\r\npresent controverted by scientific progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nRub a vulcanite rod and hold one end near some tiny pieces of paper.\r\nThey fly to it, stick to it for a time, and then fall off. The rod was\r\nelectrified--that is, its surface was affected in such a way as to be in\r\na state of molecular strain which the contact of the paper fragments\r\nalleviated. By rubbing large surfaces and collecting the electricity in\r\nsuitable receivers the strain can be made to relieve itself in the form\r\nof a violent discharge accompanied by a bright flash. This form of\r\nelectricity is known as _static_.\r\n\r\nNext, place a copper plate and a zinc plate into a jar full of diluted\r\nsulphuric acid. If a wire be attached to them a current of electricity\r\nis said to _flow_ along the wire. We must not, however, imagine that\r\nanything actually moves along inside the wire, as water, steam, or air,\r\npasses through a pipe. Professor Trowbridge says,[11] \"No other agency\r\nfor transmitting power can be stopped by such slight obstacles as\r\nelectricity. A thin sheet of paper placed across a tube conveying\r\ncompressed air would be instantly ruptured. It would take a wall of\r\nsteel at least an inch thick to stand the pressure of steam which is\r\ndriving a 10,000 horse-power engine. A thin layer of dirt beneath the\r\nwheels of an electric car can prevent the current which propels the car\r\nfrom passing to the rail, and then back to the power-house.\" There\r\nwould, indeed, be a puncture of the paper if the current had a\r\nsufficient voltage, or pressure; yet the fact remains that _current_\r\nelectricity can be very easily confined to its conductor by means of\r\nsome insulating or nonconducting envelope.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nThe most familiar form of electricity is that known as magnetism. When a\r\nbar of steel or iron is magnetized, it is supposed that the molecules in\r\nit turn and arrange themselves with all their north-seeking poles\r\ntowards the one end of the bar, and their south-seeking poles towards\r\nthe other. If the bar is balanced freely on a pivot, it comes to rest\r\npointing north and south; for, the earth being a huge magnet, its north\r\npole attracts all the north-seeking poles of the molecules, and its\r\nsouth poles the south-seeking poles. (The north-_seeking_ pole of a\r\nmagnet is marked N., though it is in reality the _south_ pole; for\r\nunlike poles are mutually attractive, and like poles repellent.)\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of magnet--_permanent_ and _temporary_. If steel is\r\nmagnetized, it remains so; but soft iron loses practically all its\r\nmagnetism as soon as the cause of magnetization is withdrawn. This is\r\nwhat we should expect; for steel is more closely compacted than iron,\r\nand the molecules therefore would be able to turn about more easily.[12]\r\nIt is fortunate for us that this is so, since on the rapid magnetization\r\nand demagnetization of soft iron depends the action of many of our\r\nelectrical mechanisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERMANENT MAGNET.\r\n\r\nMagnets are either (1) straight, in which case they are called bar\r\nmagnets; or (2) of horseshoe form, as in Figs. 50 and 51. By bending the\r\nmagnet the two poles are brought close together, and the attraction of\r\nboth may be exercised simultaneously on a bar of steel or iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINES OF FORCE.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 50 are seen a number of dotted lines. These are called _lines of\r\nmagnetic force_. If you lay a sheet of paper on a horseshoe magnet and\r\nsprinkle it with iron dust, you will at once notice how the particles\r\narrange themselves in curves similar in shape to those shown in the\r\nillustration. It is supposed (it cannot be _proved_) that magnetic force\r\nstreams away from the N. pole and describes a circular course through\r\nthe air back to the S. pole. The same remark applies to the bar magnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL MAGNETS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Permanent magnet, and the \"lines of force\"\r\nemanating from it.]\r\n\r\nIf an insulated wire is wound round and round a steel or iron bar from\r\nend to end, and has its ends connected to the terminals of an electric\r\nbattery, current rotates round the bar, and the bar is magnetized. By\r\nincreasing the strength and volume of the current, and multiplying the\r\nnumber of turns of wire, the attractive force of the magnet is\r\nincreased. Now disconnect the wires from the battery. If of iron, the\r\nmagnet at once loses its attractive force; but if of steel, it retains\r\nit in part. Instead of a simple horseshoe-shaped bar, two shorter bars\r\nriveted into a plate are generally used for electromagnets of this type.\r\nCoils of wire are wound round each bar, and connected so as to form one\r\ncontinuous whole; but the wire of one coil is wound in the direction\r\nopposite to that of the other. The free end of each goes to a battery\r\nterminal.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 51 you will notice that some of the \"lines of force\" are\r\ndeflected through the iron bar A. They pass more easily through iron\r\nthan through air; and will choose iron by preference. The attraction\r\nexercised by a magnet on iron may be due to the effort of the lines of\r\nforce to shorten their paths. It is evident that the closer A comes to\r\nthe poles of the magnet the less will be the distance to be travelled\r\nfrom one pole to the bar, along it, and back to the other pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Electro-magnet: A, armature; B, battery.]\r\n\r\nHaving now considered electricity in three of its forms--static,\r\ncurrent, and rotatory--we will pass to some of its applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC BELL.\r\n\r\nA fit device to begin with is the Electric Bell, which has so largely\r\nreplaced wire-pulled bells. These last cause a great deal of trouble\r\nsometimes, since if a wire snaps it may be necessary to take up carpets\r\nand floor-boards to put things right. Their installation is not simple,\r\nfor at every corner must be put a crank to alter the direction of the\r\npull, and the cranks mean increased friction. But when electric wires\r\nhave once been properly installed, there should be no need for touching\r\nthem for an indefinite period. They can be taken round as many corners\r\nas you wish without losing any of their conductivity, and be placed\r\nwherever is most convenient for examination. One bell may serve a large\r\nnumber of rooms if an _indicator_ be used to show where the call was\r\nmade from, by a card appearing in one of a number of small windows.\r\nBefore answering a call, the attendant presses in a button to return the\r\ncard to its normal position.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 52 we have a diagrammatic view of an electric bell and current.\r\nWhen the bell-push is pressed in, current flows from the battery to\r\nterminal T^1, round the electro-magnet M, through the pillar P and\r\nflat steel springs S and B, through the platinum-pointed screw, and back\r\nto the battery through the push. The circulation of current magnetizes\r\nM, which attracts the iron armature A attached to the spring S, and\r\ndraws the hammer H towards the gong. Just before the stroke occurs, the\r\nspring B leaves the tip of the screw, and the circuit is broken, so that\r\nthe magnet no longer attracts. H is carried by its momentum against the\r\ngong, and is withdrawn by the spring, until B once more makes contact,\r\nand the magnet is re-excited. The hammer vibrations recur many times a\r\nsecond as long as the push is pressed in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Sketch of an electric-bell circuit.]\r\n\r\nThe electric bell is used for so many purposes that they cannot all be\r\nnoted. It plays an especially important part in telephonic installations\r\nto draw the attention of the subscribers, forms an item in automatic\r\nfire and burglar alarms, and is a necessary adjunct of railway\r\nsignalling cabins.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDUCTION OR RUHMKORFF COIL.\r\n\r\nReference was made in connection with the electrical ignition of\r\ninternal-combustion engines (p. 101) to the _induction coil_. This is a\r\ndevice for increasing the _voltage_, or pressure, of a current. The\r\ntwo-cell accumulator carried in a motor car gives a voltage (otherwise\r\ncalled electro-motive force = E.M.F.) of 4·4 volts. If you attach a wire\r\nto one terminal of the accumulator and brush the loose end rapidly\r\nacross the other terminal, you will notice that a bright spark passes\r\nbetween the wire and the terminal. In reality there are two sparks, one\r\nwhen they touch, and another when they separate, but they occur so\r\nclosely together that the eye cannot separate the two impressions. A\r\nspark of this kind would not be sufficiently hot to ignite a charge in a\r\nmotor cylinder, and a spark from the induction coil is therefore used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Sketch of an induction coil.]\r\n\r\nWe give a sketch of the induction coil in Fig. 53. It consists of a core\r\nof soft iron wires round which is wound a layer of coarse insulated\r\nwire, denoted by the thick line. One end of the winding of this\r\n_primary_ coil is attached to the battery, the other to the base of a\r\nhammer, H, vibrating between the end of the core and a screw, S, passing\r\nthrough an upright, T, connected with the other terminal of the battery.\r\nThe action of the hammer is precisely the same as that of the armature\r\nof an electric bell. Outside the primary coil are wound many turns of a\r\nmuch finer wire completely insulated from the primary coil. The ends of\r\nthis _secondary_ coil are attached to the objects (in the case of a\r\nmotor car, the insulated wire of the sparking-plug and a wire projecting\r\nfrom its outer iron casing) between which a spark has to pass. As soon\r\nas H touches S the circuit is completed. The core becomes a powerful\r\nmagnet with external lines of force passing from one pole to the other\r\nover and among the turns of the secondary coil. H is almost\r\ninstantaneously attracted by the core, and the break occurs. The lines\r\nof force now (at least so it is supposed) sink into the core, cutting\r\nthrough the turns of the \"secondary,\" and causing a powerful current to\r\nflow through them. The greater the number of turns, the greater the\r\nnumber of times the lines of force are cut, and the stronger is the\r\ncurrent. If sufficiently intense, it jumps any gap in the secondary\r\ncircuit, heating the intermediate air to a state of incandescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONDENSER.\r\n\r\nThe sudden parting of H and S would produce strong sparking across the\r\ngap between them if it were not for the condenser, which consists of a\r\nnumber of tinfoil sheets separated by layers of paraffined paper. All\r\nthe \"odd\" sheets are connected with T, all the \"even\" with T^1. Now,\r\nthe more rapid the extinction of magnetism in the core after \"break\" of\r\nthe primary circuit, the more rapidly will the lines of force collapse,\r\nand the more intense will be the induced current in the secondary coil.\r\nThe condenser diminishes the period of extinction very greatly, while\r\nlengthening the period of magnetization after the \"make\" of the primary\r\ncurrent, and so decreasing the strength of the reverse current.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSFORMATION OF CURRENT.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the voltage of the primary and secondary currents\r\ndepends on the length of the windings. If there are 100 turns of wire in\r\nthe primary, and 100,000 turns in the secondary, the voltage will be\r\nincreased 1,000 times; so that a 4-volt current is \"stepped up\" to 4,000\r\nvolts. In the largest induction coils the secondary winding absorbs\r\n200-300 miles of wire, and the spark given may be anything up to four\r\nfeet in length. Such a spark would pierce a glass plate two inches\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that an induction coil increases the _amount_ of\r\ncurrent given off by a battery. It merely increases its pressure at the\r\nexpense of its volume--stores up its energy, as it were, until there is\r\nenough to do what a low-tension flow could not effect. A fair comparison\r\nwould be to picture the energy of the low-tension current as the\r\nmomentum of a number of small pebbles thrown in succession at a door,\r\nsay 100 a minute. If you went on pelting the door for hours you might\r\nmake no impression on it, but if you could knead every 100 pebbles into\r\na single stone, and throw these stones one per minute, you would soon\r\nbreak the door in.\r\n\r\nAny intermittent current can be transformed as regards its intensity.\r\nYou may either increase its pressure while decreasing its rate of flow,\r\nor _amperage_; or decrease its pressure and increase its flow. In the\r\ncase that we have considered, a continuous battery current is rendered\r\nintermittent by a mechanical contrivance. But if the current comes from\r\nan \"alternating\" dynamo--that is, is already intermittent--the\r\ncontact-breaker is not needed. There will be more to say about\r\ntransformation of current in later paragraphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF THE INDUCTION COIL.\r\n\r\nThe induction coil is used--(1.) For passing currents through glass\r\ntubes almost exhausted of air or containing highly rarefied gases. The\r\nluminous effects of these \"Geissler\" tubes are very beautiful. (2.) For\r\nproducing the now famous X or Röntgen rays. These rays accompany the\r\nlight rays given off at the negative terminal (cathode) of a vacuum\r\ntube, and are invisible to the eye unless caught on a fluorescent\r\nscreen, which reduces their rate of vibration sufficiently for the eye\r\nto be sensitive to them. The Röntgen rays have the peculiar property of\r\npenetrating many substances quite opaque to light, such as metals,\r\nstone, wood, etc., and as a consequence have proved of great use to the\r\nsurgeon in localizing or determining the nature of an internal injury.\r\nThey also have a deterrent effect upon cancerous growths. (3.) In\r\nwireless telegraphy, to cause powerful electric oscillations in the\r\nether. (4.) On motor cars, for igniting the cylinder charges. (5.) For\r\nelectrical massage of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] \"What is Electricity?\" p. 46.\r\n\r\n[12] If a magnetized bar be heated to white heat and tapped with a\r\nhammer it loses its magnetism, because the distance between the\r\nmolecules has increased, and the molecules can easily return to their\r\noriginal positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n     Needle instruments--Influence of current on the magnetic\r\n     needle--Method of reversing the current--Sounding\r\n     instruments--Telegraphic relays--Recording telegraphs--High-speed\r\n     telegraphy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a small pocket compass and wind several turns of fine insulated\r\nwire round the case, over the top and under the bottom. Now lay the\r\ncompass on a table, and turn it about until the coil is on a line with\r\nthe needle--in fact, covers it. Next touch the terminals of a battery\r\nwith the ends of the wire. The needle at once shifts either to right or\r\nleft, and remains in that position as long as the current flows. If you\r\nchange the wires over, so reversing the direction of the current, the\r\nneedle at once points in the other direction. It is to this conduct on\r\nthe part of a magnetic needle when in a \"magnetic field\" that we owe the\r\nexistence of the needle telegraph instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEEDLE INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Sketch of the side elevation of a Wheatstone\r\nneedle instrument.]\r\n\r\nProbably the best-known needle instrument is the Cooke-Wheatstone,\r\nlargely used in signal-boxes and in some post-offices. A vertical\r\nsection of it is shown in Fig. 54. It consists of a base, B, and an\r\nupright front, A, to the back of which are attached two hollow coils on\r\neither side of a magnetic needle mounted on the same shaft as a second\r\ndial needle, N, outside the front. The wires W W are connected to the\r\ntelegraph line and to the commutator, a device which, when the operator\r\nmoves the handle H to right and left, keeps reversing the direction of\r\nthe current. The needles on both receiving and transmitting instruments\r\nwag in accordance with the movements of the handle. One or more\r\nmovements form an alphabetical letter of the Morse code. Thus, if the\r\nneedle points first to left, and then to right, and comes to rest in a\r\nnormal position for a moment, the letter A is signified;\r\nright-left-left-left in quick succession = B; right-left-right-left = C,\r\nand so on. Where a marking instrument is used, a dot signifies a \"left,\"\r\nand a dash a right; and if a \"sounder\" is employed, the operator judges\r\nby the length of the intervals between the clicks.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF CURRENT ON A MAGNETIC NEEDLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 55, 56.--The coils of a needle instrument. The\r\narrows show the direction taken by the current.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 55 and 56 are two views of the coils and magnetic needle of the\r\nWheatstone instrument as they appear from behind. In Fig. 55 the current\r\nenters the left-hand coil from the left, and travels round and round it\r\nin a clockwise direction to the other end, whence it passes to the other\r\ncoil and away to the battery. Now, a coil through which a current passes\r\nbecomes a magnet. Its polarity depends on the direction in which the\r\ncurrent flows. Suppose that you are looking through the coil, and that\r\nthe current enters it from your end. If the wire is wound in a clockwise\r\ndirection, the S. pole will be nearest you; if in an anti-clockwise\r\ndirection, the N. pole. In Fig. 55 the N. poles are at the right end of\r\nthe coils, the S. poles at the left end; so the N. pole of the needle is\r\nattracted to the right, and the S. pole to the left. When the current is\r\nreversed, as in Fig. 56, the needle moves over. If no current passes, it\r\nremains vertical.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF REVERSING THE CURRENT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--General arrangement of needle-instrument\r\ncircuit. The shaded plates on the left (B and R) are in contact.]\r\n\r\nA simple method of changing the direction of the current in a\r\ntwo-instrument circuit is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 57. The\r\n_principle_ is used in the Wheatstone needle instrument. The battery\r\nterminals at each station are attached to two brass plates, A B, A^1\r\nB^1. Crossing these at right angles (under A A^1 and over B B^1)\r\nare the flat brass springs, L R, L^1 R^1, having buttons at their\r\nlower ends, and fixed at their upper ends to baseboards. When at rest\r\nthey all press upwards against the plates A and A^1 respectively. R\r\nand L^1 are connected with the line circuit, in which are the coils of\r\ndials 1 and 2, one at each station. L and R^1 are connected with the\r\nearth-plates E E^1. An operator at station 1 depresses R so as to\r\ntouch B. Current now flows from the battery to B, thence through R to\r\nthe line circuit, round the coils of both dials through L^1 A^1 and\r\nR to earth-plate E^1, through the earth to E, and then back to the\r\nbattery through L and A. The needles assume the position shown. To\r\nreverse the current the operator allows R to rise into contact with A,\r\nand depresses L to touch B. The course can be traced out easily.\r\n\r\nIn the Wheatstone \"drop-handle\" instrument (Fig. 54) the commutator may\r\nbe described as an insulated core on which are two short lengths of\r\nbrass tubing. One of these has rubbing against it a spring connected\r\nwith the + terminal of the battery; the other has similar communication\r\nwith the - terminal. Projecting from each tube is a spike, and rising\r\nfrom the baseboard are four upright brass strips not quite touching the\r\ncommutator. Those on one side lead to the line circuit, those on the\r\nother to the earth-plate. When the handle is turned one way, the spikes\r\ntouch the forward line strip and the rear earth strip, and _vice versâ_\r\nwhen moved in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUNDING INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nSometimes little brass strips are attached to the dial plate of a needle\r\ninstrument for the needle to strike against. As these give different\r\nnotes, the operator can comprehend the message by ear alone. But the\r\nmost widely used sounding instrument is the Morse sounder, named after\r\nits inventor. For this a reversible current is not needed. The receiver\r\nis merely an electro-magnet (connected with the line circuit and an\r\nearth-plate) which, when a current passes, attracts a little iron bar\r\nattached to the middle of a pivoted lever. The free end of the lever\r\nworks between two stops. Every time the circuit is closed by the\r\ntransmitting key at the sending station the lever flies down against the\r\nlower stop, to rise again when the circuit is broken. The duration of\r\nits stay decides whether a \"long\" or \"short\" is meant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAPHIC RELAYS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Section of a telegraph wire insulator on its\r\narm. The shaded circle is the line wire, the two blank circles indicate\r\nthe wire which ties the line wire to the insulator.]\r\n\r\nWhen an electric current has travelled for a long distance through a\r\nwire its strength is much reduced on account of the resistance of the\r\nwire, and may be insufficient to cause the electro-magnet of the sounder\r\nto move the heavy lever. Instead, therefore, of the current acting\r\ndirectly on the sounder magnet, it is used to energize a small magnet,\r\nor _relay_, which pulls down a light bar and closes a second \"local\"\r\ncircuit--that is, one at the receiver end--worked by a separate battery,\r\nwhich has sufficient power to operate the sounder.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORDING TELEGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nBy attaching a small wheel to the end of a Morse-sounder lever, by\r\narranging an ink-well for the wheel to dip into when the end falls, and\r\nby moving a paper ribbon slowly along for the wheel to press against\r\nwhen it rises, a self-recording Morse inker is produced. The\r\nribbon-feeding apparatus is set in motion automatically by the current,\r\nand continues to pull the ribbon along until the message is completed.\r\n\r\nThe Hughes type-printer covers a sheet of paper with printed characters\r\nin bold Roman type. The transmitter has a keyboard, on which are marked\r\nletters, signs, and numbers; also a type-wheel, with the characters on\r\nits circumference, rotated by electricity. The receiver contains\r\nmechanisms for rotating another type-wheel synchronously--that is, in\r\ntime--with the first; for shifting the wheel across the paper; for\r\npressing the paper against the wheel; and for moving the paper when a\r\nfresh line is needed. These are too complicated to be described here in\r\ndetail. By means of relays one transmitter may be made to work five\r\nhundred receivers. In London a single operator, controlling a keyboard\r\nin the central dispatching office, causes typewritten messages to spell\r\nthemselves out simultaneously in machines distributed all over the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nThe tape machine resembles that just described in many details. The main\r\ndifference is that it prints on a continuous ribbon instead of on\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nAutomatic electric printers of some kind or other are to be found in\r\nthe vestibules of all the principal hotels and clubs of our large\r\ncities, and in the offices of bankers, stockbrokers, and newspaper\r\neditors. In London alone over 500 million words are printed by the\r\nreceivers in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH-SPEED TELEGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nAt certain seasons, or when important political events are taking place,\r\nthe telegraph service would become congested with news were there not\r\nsome means of transmitting messages at a much greater speed than is\r\npossible by hand signalling. Fifty words a minute is about the limit\r\nspeed that a good operator can maintain. By means of Wheatstone's\r\n_automatic transmitter_ the rate can be increased to 400 words per\r\nminute. Paper ribbons are punched in special machines by a number of\r\nclerks with a series of holes which by their position indicate a dot or\r\na dash. The ribbons are passed through a special transmitter, over\r\nlittle electric brushes, which make contact through the holes with\r\nsurfaces connected to the line circuit. At the receiver end the message\r\nis printed by a Morse inker.\r\n\r\nIt has been found possible to send several messages simultaneously over\r\na single line. To effect this a _distributer_ is used to put a number of\r\ntransmitters at one end of the line in communication with an equal\r\nnumber of receivers at the other end, fed by a second distributer\r\nkeeping perfect time with the first. Instead of a signal coming as a\r\nwhole to any one instrument it arrives in little bits, but these follow\r\none another so closely as to be practically continuous. By working a\r\nnumber of automatic transmitters through a distributer, a thousand words\r\nor more per minute are easily dispatched over a single wire.\r\n\r\nThe Pollak Virag system employs a punched ribbon, and the receiver\r\ntraces out the message in alphabetical characters on a moving strip of\r\nsensitized photographic paper. A mirror attached to a vibrating\r\ndiaphragm reflects light from a lamp on to the strip, which is\r\nautomatically developed and fixed in chemical baths. The method of\r\nmoving the mirror so as to make the rays trace out words is extremely\r\ningenious. Messages have been transmitted by this system at the rate of\r\n180,000 words per hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nWIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n     The transmitting apparatus--The receiving apparatus--Syntonic\r\n     transmission--The advance of wireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last chapter we reviewed briefly some systems of sending\r\ntelegraphic messages from one point of the earth's surface to another\r\nthrough a circuit consisting partly of an insulated wire and partly of\r\nthe earth itself. The metallic portion of a long circuit, especially if\r\nit be a submarine cable, is costly to install, so that in quite the\r\nearly days of telegraphy efforts were made to use the ether in the place\r\nof wire as one conductor.\r\n\r\nWhen a hammer strikes an anvil the air around is violently disturbed.\r\nThis disturbance spreads through the molecules of the air in much the\r\nsame way as ripples spread from the splash of a stone thrown into a\r\npond. When the sound waves reach the ear they agitate the tympanum, or\r\ndrum membrane, and we \"hear a noise.\" The hammer is here the\r\ntransmitter, the air the conductor, the ear the receiver.\r\n\r\nIn wireless telegraphy we use the ether as the conductor of electrical\r\ndisturbances.[13] Marconi, Slaby, Branly, Lodge, De Forest, Popoff, and\r\nothers have invented apparatus for causing disturbances of the requisite\r\nkind, and for detecting their presence.\r\n\r\nThe main features of a wireless telegraphy outfit are shown in Figs. 59\r\nand 61.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSMITTER APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider the transmitting outfit (Fig. 59). It includes a\r\nbattery, dispatching key, and an induction coil having its secondary\r\ncircuit terminals connected with two wires, the one leading to an\r\nearth-plate, the other carried aloft on poles or suspended from a kite.\r\nIn the large station at Poldhu, Cornwall, for transatlantic signalling,\r\nthere are special wooden towers 215 feet high, between which the aërial\r\nwires hang. At their upper and lower ends respectively the earth and\r\naërial wires terminate in brass balls separated by a gap. When the\r\noperator depresses the key the induction coil charges these balls and\r\nthe wires attached thereto with high-tension electricity. As soon as the\r\nquantity collected exceeds the resistance of the air-gap, a discharge\r\ntakes place between the balls, and the ether round the aërial wire is\r\nviolently disturbed, and waves of electrical energy are propagated\r\nthrough it. The rapidity with which the discharges follow one another,\r\nand their travelling power, depends on the strength of the induction\r\ncoil, the length of the air-gap, and the capacity of the wires.[14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Sketch of the transmitter of a wireless\r\ntelegraphy outfit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--A Marconi coherer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIVING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nThe human body is quite insensitive to these etheric waves. We cannot\r\nfeel, hear, or see them. But at the receiving station there is what may\r\nbe called an \"electric eye.\" Technically it is named a _coherer_. A\r\nMarconi coherer is seen in Fig. 60. Inside a small glass tube exhausted\r\nof air are two silver plugs, P P, carrying terminals, T T, projecting\r\nthrough the glass at both ends. A small gap separates the plugs at the\r\ncentre, and this gap is partly filled with nickel-silver powder. If the\r\nterminals of the coherer are attached to those of a battery, practically\r\nno current will pass under ordinary conditions, as the particles of\r\nnickel-silver touch each other very lightly and make a \"bad contact.\"\r\nBut if the coherer is also attached to wires leading into the earth and\r\nair, and ether waves strike those wires, at every impact the particles\r\nwill cohere--that is, pack tightly together--and allow battery current\r\nto pass. The property of cohesion of small conductive bodies when\r\ninfluenced by Hertzian waves was first noticed in 1874 by Professor D.E.\r\nHughes while experimenting with a telephone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Sketch of the receiving apparatus in a\r\nwireless telegraphy outfit.]\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to examine the apparatus of which a coherer\r\nforms part (Fig. 61). First, we notice the aërial and earth wires, to\r\nwhich are attached other wires from battery A. This battery circuit\r\npasses round the relay magnet R and through two choking coils, whose\r\nfunction is to prevent the Hertzian waves entering the battery. The\r\nrelay, when energized, brings contact D against E and closes the circuit\r\nof battery B, which is much more powerful than battery A, and operates\r\nthe magnet M as well as the _tapper_, which is practically an electric\r\nbell minus the gong. (The tapper circuit is indicated by the dotted\r\nlines.)\r\n\r\nWe will suppose the transmitter of a distant station to be at work. The\r\nelectric waves strike the aërial wire of the receiving station, and\r\ncause the coherer to cohere and pass current. The relay is closed, and\r\nboth tapper and Morse inker begin to work. The tapper keeps striking the\r\ncoherer and shakes the particles loose after every cohesion. If this\r\nwere not done the current of A would pass continuously after cohesion\r\nhad once taken place. When the key of the transmitter is pressed down,\r\nthe waves follow one another very quickly, and the acquired conductivity\r\nof the coherer is only momentarily destroyed by the tap of the hammer.\r\nDuring the impression of a dot by the Morse inker, contact is made and\r\nbroken repeatedly; but as the armature of the inker is heavy and slow to\r\nmove it does not vibrate in time with the relay and tapper. Therefore\r\nthe Morse instrument reproduces in dots and dashes the short and long\r\ndepressions of the key at the transmitting station, while the tapper\r\nworks rapidly in time with the relay. The Morse inker is shown\r\ndiagrammatically. While current passes through M the armature is pulled\r\ntowards it, the end P, carrying an inked wheel, rises, and a mark is\r\nmade on the tape W, which is moved continuously being drawn forward off\r\nreel R by the clockwork--or electrically-driven rollers R^1 R^2.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTONIC TRANSMISSION.\r\n\r\nIf a number of transmitting stations are sending out messages\r\nsimultaneously, a jumble of signals would affect all the receivers\r\nround, unless some method were employed for rendering a receiver\r\nsensitive only to the waves intended to influence it. Also, if\r\ndistinction were impossible, even with one transmitter in action its\r\nmessage might go to undesired stations.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of \"tuning\" receivers and transmitters, but the\r\nprinciple underlying them all is analogous to that of mechanical\r\nvibration. If a weight is suspended from the end of a spiral spring, and\r\ngiven an upward blow, it bobs up and down a certain number of times per\r\nminute, every movement from start to finish having exactly the same\r\nduration as the rest. The resistance of the air and the internal\r\nfriction of the spring gradually lessen the amplitude of the movements,\r\nand the weight finally comes to rest. Suppose that the weight scales 30\r\nlbs., and that it naturally bobs twenty times a minute. If you now take\r\na feather and give it a push every three seconds you can coax it into\r\nvigorous motion, assuming that every push catches it exactly on the\r\nrebound. The same effect would be produced more slowly if 6 or 9 second\r\nintervals were substituted. But if you strike it at 4, 5, or 7 second\r\nintervals it will gradually cease to oscillate, as the effect of one\r\nblow neutralizes that of another. The same phenomenon is witnessed when\r\ntwo tuning-forks of equal pitch are mounted near one another, and one is\r\nstruck. The other soon picks up the note. But a fork of unequal pitch\r\nwould remain dumb.\r\n\r\nNow, every electrical circuit has a \"natural period of oscillation\" in\r\nwhich its electric charge vibrates. It is found possible to \"tune,\" or\r\n\"syntonize,\" the aërial rod or wire of a receiving station with a\r\ntransmitter. A vertical wire about 200 feet in length, says Professor\r\nJ.A. Fleming,[15] has a natural time period of electrical oscillation of\r\nabout one-millionth of a second. Therefore if waves strike this wire a\r\nmillion times a second they will reinforce one another and influence the\r\ncoherer; whereas a less or greater frequency will leave it practically\r\nunaffected. By adjusting the receiving circuit to the transmitter, or\r\n_vice versâ_, selective wireless telegraphy becomes possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCE OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe history of wireless telegraphy may be summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n1842.--Professor Morse sent aërial messages across the Susquehanna\r\nRiver. A line containing a battery and transmitter was carried on posts\r\nalong one bank and \"earthed\" in the river at each end. On the other bank\r\nwas a second wire attached to a receiver and similarly earthed. Whenever\r\ncontact was made and broken on the battery side, the receiver on the\r\nother was affected. Distance about 1 mile.\r\n\r\n1859.--James Bowman Lindsay transmitted messages across the Tay at\r\nGlencarse in a somewhat similar way. Distance about 1/2 mile.\r\n\r\n1885.--Sir William Preece signalled from Lavernock Point, near Cardiff,\r\nto Steep Holm, an island in the Bristol Channel. Distance about 5-1/2\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn all these electrical _induction_ of current was employed.\r\n\r\n1886.--Hertzian waves discovered.\r\n\r\n1895.--Professor A. Popoff sent Hertzian wave messages over a distance\r\nof 3 miles.\r\n\r\n1897.--Marconi signalled from the Needles Hotel, Isle of Wight, to\r\nSwanage; 17-1/2 miles.\r\n\r\n1901.--Messages sent at sea for 380 miles.\r\n\r\n1901, Dec. 17.--Messages transmitted from Poldhu, Cornwall, to Hospital\r\nPoint, Newfoundland; 2,099 miles.\r\n\r\nMr. Marconi has so perfected tuning devices that his transatlantic\r\nmessages do not affect receivers placed on board ships crossing the\r\nocean, unless they are purposely tuned. Atlantic liners now publish\r\ndaily small newspapers containing the latest news, flashed through space\r\nfrom land stations. In the United States the De Forest and Fessenden\r\nsystems are being rapidly extended to embrace the most out-of-the-way\r\ndistricts. Every navy of importance has adopted wireless telegraphy,\r\nwhich, as was proved during the Russo-Japanese War, can be of the\r\ngreatest help in directing operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] Named after their first discoverer, Dr. Hertz of Carlsruhe,\r\n\"Hertzian waves.\"\r\n\r\n[14] For long-distance transmission powerful dynamos take the place of\r\nthe induction coil and battery.\r\n\r\n[15] \"Technics,\" vol. ii. p. 566.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\n     The Bell telephone--The Edison transmitter--The granular carbon\r\n     transmitter--General arrangement of a telephone\r\n     circuit--Double-line circuits--Telephone exchanges--Submarine\r\n     telephony.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of everyday life the telephone is even more useful than\r\nthe telegraph. Telephones now connect one room of a building with\r\nanother, house with house, town with town, country with country. An\r\ninfinitely greater number of words pass over the telephonic circuits of\r\nthe world in a year than are transmitted by telegraph operators. The\r\ntelephone has become an important adjunct to the transaction of business\r\nof all sorts. Its wires penetrate everywhere. Without moving from his\r\ndesk, the London citizen may hold easy converse with a Parisian, a New\r\nYorker with a dweller in Chicago.\r\n\r\nWonderful as the transmission of signals over great distances is, the\r\ntransmission of human speech so clearly that individual voices may be\r\ndistinguished hundreds of miles away is even more so. Yet the instrument\r\nwhich works the miracle is essentially simple in its principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELL TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Section of a Bell telephone.]\r\n\r\nThe first telephone that came into general use was that of Bell, shown\r\nin Fig. 62. In a central hole of an ebonite casing is fixed a permanent\r\nmagnet, M. The casing expands at one end to accommodate a coil of\r\ninsulated wire wound about one extremity of a magnet. The coil ends are\r\nattached to wires passing through small channels to terminals at the\r\nrear. A circular diaphragm, D, of very thin iron plate, clamped between\r\nthe concave mouthpiece and the casing, almost touches the end of the\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose that two Bell telephones, A and B, are connected up by\r\nwires, so that the wires and the coils form a complete circuit. Words\r\nare spoken into A. The air vibrations, passing through the central hole\r\nin the cover, make the diaphragm vibrate towards and away from the\r\nmagnet. The distances through which the diaphragm moves have been\r\nmeasured, and found not to exceed in some cases more than 1/10,000,000\r\nof an inch! Its movements distort the shape of the \"lines of force\" (see\r\np. 118) emanating from the magnet, and these, cutting through the turns\r\nof the coil, induce a current in the line circuit. As the diaphragm\r\napproaches the magnet a circuit is sent in one direction; as it leaves\r\nit, in the other. Consequently speech produces rapidly alternating\r\ncurrents in the circuit, their duration and intensity depending on the\r\nnature of the sound.\r\n\r\nNow consider telephone B. The currents passing through its coil increase\r\nor diminish the magnetism of the magnet, and cause it to attract its\r\ndiaphragm with varying force. The vibration of the diaphragm disturbs\r\nthe air in exact accordance with the vibrations of A's diaphragm, and\r\nspeech is reproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDISON TRANSMITTER.\r\n\r\nThe Bell telephone may be used both as a transmitter and a receiver, and\r\nthe permanent magnetism of the cores renders it independent of an\r\nelectric battery. But currents generated by it are so minute that they\r\ncannot overcome the resistance of a long circuit; therefore a battery is\r\nnow always used, and with it a special device as transmitter.\r\n\r\nIf in a circuit containing a telephone and a battery there be a loose\r\ncontact, and this be shaken, the varying resistance of the contact will\r\ncause electrical currents of varying force to pass through the circuit.\r\nEdison introduced the first successful _microphone_ transmitter, in\r\nwhich a small platinum disc connected to the diaphragm pressed with\r\nvarying force against a disc of carbon, each disc forming part of the\r\ncircuit. Vibrations of the diaphragm caused current to flow in a series\r\nof rapid pulsations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Section of a granular carbon transmitter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRANULAR CARBON TRANSMITTER.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 63 we have a section of a microphone transmitter now very widely\r\nused. It was invented, in its original form, by an English clergyman\r\nnamed Hunnings. Resting in a central cavity of an ebonite seating is a\r\ncarbon block, C, with a face moulded into a number of pyramidal\r\nprojections, P P. The space between C and a carbon diaphragm, D, is\r\npacked with carbon granules, G G. C has direct contact with line\r\nterminal T, which screws into it; D with T^1 through the brass casing,\r\nscrew S, and a small plate at the back of the transmitter. Voice\r\nvibrations compress G G, and allow current to pass more freely from D\r\nto C. This form of microphone is very delicate, and unequalled for\r\nlong-distance transmission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--A diagrammatic representation of a telephonic\r\ncircuit.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF A TELEPHONE CIRCUIT.\r\n\r\nIn many forms of subscriber's instruments both receiver and transmitter\r\nare mounted on a single handle in such a way as to be conveniently\r\nplaced for ear and mouth. For the sake of clearness the diagrammatic\r\nsketch of a complete installation (Fig. 64) shows them separated. The\r\ntransmitters, it will be noticed, are located in battery circuits,\r\nincluding the primary windings P P_2 of induction coils. The\r\ntransmitters are in the line circuit, which includes the secondary\r\nwindings S S_2 of the coils.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that the transmitters are, in the first instance, both\r\nhung on the hooks of the metallic switches, which their weight depresses\r\nto the position indicated by the dotted lines. The handle of the\r\nmagneto-generator at the left-end station is turned, and current passes\r\nthrough the closed circuit:--Line A, E B_2, contact 10, the switch 9;\r\nline B, 4, the other switch, contact 5, and E B. Both bells ring. Both\r\nparties now lift their receivers from the switch hooks. The switches\r\nrise against contacts 1, 2, 3 and 6, 7, 8 respectively. Both primary and\r\nboth secondary circuits are now completed, while the bells are\r\ndisconnected from the line wires. The pulsations set up by transmitter T\r\nin primary coil P are magnified by secondary coil S for transmission\r\nthrough the line circuit, and affect both receivers. The same thing\r\nhappens when T_2 is used. At the end of the conversation the receivers\r\nare hung on their hooks again, and the bell circuit is remade, ready for\r\nthe next call.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TELEPHONE EXCHANGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE-LINE CIRCUITS.\r\n\r\nThe currents used in telephones pulsate very rapidly, but are very\r\nfeeble. Electric disturbances caused by the proximity of telegraph or\r\ntram wires would much interfere with them if the earth were used for the\r\nreturn circuit. It has been found that a complete metallic circuit (two\r\nwires) is practically free from interference, though where a number of\r\nwires are hung on the same poles, speech-sounds may be faintly induced\r\nin one circuit from another. This defect is, however, minimized by\r\ncrossing the wires about among themselves, so that any one line does not\r\npass round the corresponding insulator on every pole.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEPHONE EXCHANGES.\r\n\r\nIn a district where a number of telephones are used the subscribers are\r\nput into connection with one another through an \"exchange,\" to which all\r\nthe wires lead. One wire of each subscriber runs to a common \"earth;\"\r\nthe other terminates at a switchboard presided over by an operator. In\r\nan exchange used by many subscribers the terminals are distributed over\r\na number of switchboards, each containing 80 to 100 terminals, and\r\nattended to by an operator, usually a girl.\r\n\r\nWhen a subscriber wishes to be connected to another subscriber, he\r\neither turns the handle of a magneto generator, which causes a shutter\r\nto fall and expose his number at the exchange, or simply depresses a key\r\nwhich works a relay at the exchange and lights a tiny electric lamp. The\r\noperator, seeing the signal, connects her telephone with the\r\nsubscriber's circuit and asks the number wanted. This given, she rings\r\nup the other subscriber, and connects the two circuits by means of an\r\ninsulated wire cord having a spike at each end to fit the \"jack\" sockets\r\nof the switchboard terminals. The two subscribers are now in\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--The headdress of an operator at a telephone\r\nexchange. The receiver is fastened over one ear, and the transmitter to\r\nthe chest.]\r\n\r\nIf a number on switchboard A calls for a number on switchboard C, the\r\noperator at A connects her subscriber by a jack cord to a trunk line\r\nrunning to C, where the operator similarly connects the trunk line with\r\nthe number asked for, after ringing up the subscriber. The central\r\nexchange of one town is connected with that of another by one or more\r\ntrunk lines, so that a subscriber may speak through an indefinite number\r\nof exchanges. So perfect is the modern telephone that the writer\r\nremembers on one occasion hearing the door-bell ring in a house more\r\nthan a hundred miles away, with which he was at the moment in telephonic\r\nconnection, though three exchanges were in the circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBMARINE TELEPHONY.\r\n\r\nThough telegraphic messages are transmitted easily through thousands of\r\nmiles of cable,[16] submarine telephony is at present restricted to\r\ncomparatively short distances. When a current passes through a cable,\r\nelectricity of opposite polarity induced on the outside of the cable\r\ndamps the vibration in the conductor. In the Atlantic cable, strong\r\ncurrents of electricity are poured periodically into one end, and though\r\nmuch enfeebled when they reach the other they are sufficiently strong to\r\nwork a very delicate \"mirror galvanometer\" (invented by Lord Kelvin),\r\nwhich moves a reflected ray up and down a screen, the direction of the\r\nmovements indicating a dot or a dash. Reversible currents are used in\r\ntransmarine telegraphy. The galvanometer is affected like the coils and\r\nsmall magnet in Wheatstone's needle instrument (p. 128).\r\n\r\nTelephonic currents are too feeble to penetrate many miles of cable.\r\nThere is telephonic communication between England and France, and\r\nEngland and Ireland. But transatlantic telephony is still a thing of the\r\nfuture. It is hoped, however, that by inserting induction coils at\r\nintervals along the cables the currents may be \"stepped up\" from point\r\nto point, and so get across. Turning to Fig. 64, we may suppose S to be\r\non shore at the English end, and S_2 to be the _primary_ winding of an\r\ninduction coil a hundred miles away in the sea, which magnifies the\r\nenfeebled vibrations for a journey to S_3, where they are again\r\nrevived; and so on, till the New World is reached. The difficulty is to\r\ndevise induction coils of great power though of small size. Yet science\r\nadvances nowadays so fast that we may live to hear words spoken at the\r\nAntipodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] In 1896 the late Li Hung Chang sent a cablegram from China to\r\nEngland (12,608 miles), and received a reply, in _seven minutes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\nDYNAMOS AND ELECTRIC MOTORS.\r\n\r\n     A simple dynamo--Continuous-current dynamos--Multipolar\r\n     dynamos--Exciting the field magnets--Alternating current\r\n     dynamos--The transmission of power--The electric motor--Electric\r\n     lighting--The incandescent lamp--Arc lamps--\"Series\" and \"parallel\"\r\n     arrangement of lamps--Current for electric lamps--Electroplating.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters we have incidentally referred to the conversion of\r\nmechanical work into electrical energy. In this we shall examine how it\r\nis done--how the silently spinning dynamo develops power, and why the\r\nmotor spins when current is passed through it.\r\n\r\nWe must begin by returning to our first electrical diagram (Fig. 50),\r\nand calling to mind the invisible \"lines of force\" which permeate the\r\nether in the immediate neighbourhood of a magnet's poles, called the\r\n_magnetic field_ of the magnet.\r\n\r\nMany years ago (1831) the great Michael Faraday discovered that if a\r\nloop of wire were moved up and down between the poles of an\r\nelectro-magnet (Fig. 66) a current was induced in the loop, its\r\ndirection depending upon that in which the loop was moved. The energy\r\nrequired to cut the lines of force passed in some mysterious way into\r\nthe wire. Why this is so we cannot say, but, taking advantage of the\r\nfact, electricians have gradually developed the enormous machines which\r\nnow send vehicles spinning over metal tracks, light our streets and\r\nhouses, and supply energy to innumerable factories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.]\r\n\r\nThe strength of the current induced in a circuit cutting the lines of\r\nforce of a magnet is called its pressure, voltage, or electro-motive\r\nforce (expressed shortly E.M.F.). It may be compared with the\r\npounds-to-the-square-inch of steam. In order to produce an E.M.F. of one\r\nvolt it is calculated that 100,000,000 lines of force must be cut every\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe voltage depends on three things:--(1.) The _strength_ of the magnet:\r\nthe stronger it is, the greater the number of lines of force coming from\r\nit. (2.) The _length_ of the conductor cutting the lines of force: the\r\nlonger it is, the more lines it will cut. (3.) The _speed_ at which the\r\nconductor moves: the faster it travels, the more lines it will cut in a\r\ngiven time. It follows that a powerful dynamo, or mechanical producer of\r\ncurrent, must have strong magnets and a long conductor; and the latter\r\nmust be moved at a high speed across the lines of force.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE DYNAMO.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 67 we have the simplest possible form of dynamo--a single turn\r\nof wire, _w x y z_, mounted on a spindle, and having one end attached to\r\nan insulated ring C, the other to an insulated ring C^1. Two small\r\nbrushes, B B^1, of wire gauze or carbon, rubbing continuously against\r\nthese collecting rings, connect them with a wire which completes the\r\ncircuit. The armature, as the revolving coil is called, is mounted\r\nbetween the poles of a magnet, where the lines of force are thickest.\r\nThese lines are _supposed_ to stream from the N. to the S. pole.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 67 the armature has reached a position in which _y z_ and _w x_\r\nare cutting no, or very few, lines of force, as they move practically\r\nparallel to the lines. This is called the _zero_ position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 68 the armature, moving at right angles to the lines of force,\r\ncuts a maximum number in a given time, and the current induced in the\r\ncoil is therefore now most intense. Here we must stop a moment to\r\nconsider how to decide in which direction the current flows. The\r\narmature is revolving in a clockwise direction, and _y z_, therefore, is\r\nmoving downwards. Now, suppose that you rest your _left_ hand on the N.\r\npole of the magnet so that the arm lies in a line with the magnet. Point\r\nyour forefinger towards the S. pole. It will indicate the _direction of\r\nthe lines of force_. Bend your other three fingers downwards over the\r\nedge of the N. pole. They will indicate the _direction in which the\r\nconductor is moving_ across the magnetic field. Stick out the thumb at\r\nright angles to the forefinger. It points in the direction in which the\r\n_induced_ current is moving through the nearer half of the coil.\r\nTherefore lines of force, conductor, and induced current travel in\r\nplanes which, like the top and two adjacent sides of a box, are at right\r\nangles to one another.\r\n\r\nWhile current travels from _z_ to _y_--that is, _from_ the ring C^1 to\r\n_y_--it also travels from _x_ to _w_, because _w x_ rises while _y z_\r\ndescends. So that a current circulates through the coil and the exterior\r\npart of the circuit, including the lamp. After _z y_ has passed the\r\nlowest possible point of the circle it begins to ascend, _w x_ to\r\ndescend. The direction of the current is therefore reversed; and as the\r\nchange is repeated every half-revolution this form of dynamo is called\r\nan _alternator_ or creator of alternating currents. A well-known type of\r\nalternator is the magneto machine which sends shocks through any one who\r\ncompletes the external circuit by holding the brass handles connected by\r\nwires to the brushes. The faster the handle of the machine is turned the\r\nmore frequent is the alternation, and the stronger the current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUOUS-CURRENT DYNAMOS.\r\n\r\nAn alternating current is not so convenient for some purposes as a\r\ncontinuous current. It is therefore sometimes desirable (even necessary)\r\nto convert the alternating into a uni-directional or continuous current.\r\nHow this is done is shown in Figs. 69 and 70. In place of the two\r\ncollecting rings C C^1, we now have a single ring split longitudinally\r\ninto two portions, one of which is connected to each end of the coil _w\r\nx y z_. In Fig. 69 brush B has just passed the gap on to segment C,\r\nbrush B^1 on to segment C^1. For half a revolution these remain\r\nrespectively in contact; then, just as _y z_ begins to rise and _w x_ to\r\ndescend, the brushes cross the gaps again and exchange segments, so that\r\nthe current is perpetually flowing one way through the circuit. The\r\neffect of the commutator[17] is, in fact, equivalent to transposing the\r\nbrushes of the collecting rings of the alternator every time the coil\r\nreaches a zero position.\r\n\r\nFigs. 71 and 72 give end views in section of the coil and the\r\ncommutator, with the coil in the position of minimum and maximum\r\nefficiency. The arrow denotes the direction of movement; the double\r\ndotted lines the commutator end of the revolving coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL CONTINUOUS-CURRENT DYNAMOS.\r\n\r\nThe electrical output of our simple dynamo would be increased if,\r\ninstead of a single turn of wire, we used a coil of many turns. A\r\nfurther improvement would result from mounting on the shaft, inside the\r\ncoil, a core or drum of iron, to entice the lines of force within reach\r\nof the revolving coil. It is evident that any lines which pass through\r\nthe air outside the circle described by the coil cannot be cut, and are\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.]\r\n\r\nThe core is not a solid mass of iron, but built up of a number of very\r\nthin iron discs threaded on the shaft and insulated from one another to\r\nprevent electric eddies, which would interfere with the induced current\r\nin the conductor.[18] Sometimes there are openings through the core from\r\nend to end to ventilate and cool it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.]\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed that in the case of a single coil the current\r\nrises and falls in a series of pulsations. Such a form of armature would\r\nbe unsuitable for large dynamos, which accordingly have a number of\r\ncoils wound over their drums, at equal distances round the\r\ncircumference, and a commutator divided into an equal number of\r\nsegments. The subject of drum winding is too complicated for brief\r\ntreatment, and we must therefore be content with noticing that the coils\r\nare so connected to their respective commutator segments and to one\r\nanother that they mutually assist one another. A glance at Fig. 73 will\r\nhelp to explain this. Here we have in section a number of conductors on\r\nthe right of the drum (marked with a cross to show that current is\r\nmoving, as it were, into the page), connected with conductors on the\r\nleft (marked with a dot to signify current coming out of the page). If\r\nthe \"crossed\" and \"dotted\" conductors were respectively the \"up\" and\r\n\"down\" turns of a single coil terminating in a simple split commutator\r\n(Fig. 69), when the coil had been revolved through an angle of 90° some\r\nof the up turns would be ascending and some descending, so that\r\nconflicting currents would arise. Yet we want to utilize the whole\r\nsurface of the drum; and by winding a number of coils in the manner\r\nhinted at, each coil, as it passes the zero point, top or bottom, at\r\nonce generates a current in the desired direction and reinforces that in\r\nall the other turns of its own and of other coils on the same side of a\r\nline drawn vertically through the centre. There is thus practically no\r\nfluctuation in the pressure of the current generated.\r\n\r\nThe action of single and multiple coil windings may be compared to that\r\nof single and multiple pumps. Water is ejected by a single pump in\r\ngulps; whereas the flow from a pipe fed by several pumps arranged to\r\ndeliver consecutively is much more constant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULTIPOLAR DYNAMOS.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered the magnetic field produced by one bi-polar\r\nmagnet only. Large dynamos have four, six, eight, or more field magnets\r\nset inside a casing, from which their cores project towards the armature\r\nso as almost to touch it (Fig. 74). The magnet coils are wound to give\r\nN. and S. poles alternately at their armature ends round the field; and\r\nthe lines of force from each N. pole stream each way to the two adjacent\r\nS. poles across the path of the armature coils. In dynamos of this kind\r\nseveral pairs of collecting brushes pick current off the commutator at\r\nequidistant points on its circumference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--A Holmes continuous current dynamo: A,\r\narmature; C, commutator; M, field magnets.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCITING THE FIELD MAGNETS.\r\n\r\nUntil current passes through the field magnet coils, no magnetic field\r\ncan be created. How are the coils supplied with current? A dynamo,\r\nstarting for the first time, is excited by a current from an outside\r\nsource; but when it has once begun to generate current it feeds its\r\nmagnets itself, and ever afterwards will be self-exciting,[19] owing to\r\nthe residual magnetism left in the magnet cores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Partly finished commutator.]\r\n\r\nLook carefully at Figs. 77 and 78. In the first of these you will\r\nobserve that part of the wire forming the external circuit is wound\r\nround the arms of the field magnet. This is called a _series_ winding.\r\nIn this case _all_ the current generated helps to excite the dynamo. At\r\nthe start the residual magnetism of the magnet cores gives a weak field.\r\nThe armature coils cut this and pass a current through the circuit. The\r\nmagnets are further excited, and the field becomes stronger; and so on\r\ntill the dynamo is developing full power. Series winding is used where\r\nthe current in the external circuit is required to be very constant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--The brushes of a Holmes dynamo.]\r\n\r\nFig. 78 shows another method of winding--the _shunt_. Most of the\r\ncurrent generated passes through the external circuit 2, 2; but a part\r\nis switched through a separate winding for the magnets, denoted by the\r\nfine wire 1, 1. Here the strength of the magnetism does not vary\r\ndirectly with the current, as only a small part of the current serves\r\nthe magnets. The shunt winding is therefore used where the voltage (or\r\npressure) must be constant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Sketch showing a \"series\" winding.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--\"Shunt\" winding.]\r\n\r\nA third method is a combination of the two already named. A winding of\r\nfine wire passes from brush to brush round the magnets; and there is\r\nalso a series winding as in Fig. 77. This compound method is adapted\r\nmore especially for electric traction.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNATING DYNAMOS.\r\n\r\nThese have their field magnets excited by a separate continuous current\r\ndynamo of small size. The field magnets usually revolve inside a fixed\r\narmature (the reverse of the arrangement in a direct-current generator);\r\nor there may be a fixed central armature and field magnets revolving\r\noutside it. This latter arrangement is found in the great power stations\r\nat Niagara Falls, where the enormous field-rings are mounted on the top\r\nends of vertical shafts, driven by water-turbines at the bottom of pits\r\n178 feet deep, down which water is led to the turbines through great\r\npipes, or penstocks. The weight of each shaft and the field-ring\r\nattached totals about thirty-five tons. This mass revolves 250 times a\r\nminute, and 5,000 horse power is constantly developed by the dynamo.\r\nSimilar dynamos of 10,000 horse power each have been installed on the\r\nCanadian side of the Falls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSMISSION OF POWER.\r\n\r\nAlternating current is used where power has to be transmitted for long\r\ndistances, because such a current can be intensified, or stepped up, by\r\na transformer somewhat similar in principle to a Ruhmkorff coil _minus_\r\na contact-breaker (see p. 122). A typical example of transformation is\r\nseen in Fig. 79. Alternating current of 5,000 volts pressure is produced\r\nin the generating station and sent through conductors to a distant\r\nstation, where a transformer, B, reduces the pressure to 500 volts to\r\ndrive an alternating motor, C, which in turn operates a direct current\r\ndynamo, D. This dynamo has its + terminal connected with the insulated\r\nor \"live\" rail of an electric railway, and its - terminal with the wheel\r\nrails, which are metallically united at the joints to act as a\r\n\"return.\" On its way from the live rail to the return the current passes\r\nthrough the motors. In the case of trams the conductor is either a cable\r\ncarried overhead on standards, from which it passes to the motor through\r\na trolley arm, or a rail laid underground in a conduit between the\r\nrails. In the top of the conduit is a slit through which an arm carrying\r\na contact shoe on the end projects from the car. The shoe rubs\r\ncontinuously on the live rail as the car moves.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to the question of transformation of current.\r\n\"Why,\" it may be asked, \"should we not send low-pressure _direct_\r\ncurrent to a distant station straight from the dynamo, instead of\r\naltering its nature and pressure? Or, at any rate, why not use\r\nhigh-pressure direct current, and transform _that_?\" The answer is, that\r\nto transmit a large amount of electrical energy at low pressure (or\r\nvoltage) would necessitate large volume (or _amperage_) and a big and\r\nexpensive copper conductor to carry it. High-pressure direct current is\r\nnot easily generated, since the sparking at the collecting brushes as\r\nthey pass over the commutator segments gives trouble. So engineers\r\nprefer high-pressure alternating current, which is easily produced, and\r\ncan be sent through a small and inexpensive conductor with little loss.\r\nAlso its voltage can be transformed by apparatus having no revolving\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC MOTOR.\r\n\r\nAnybody who understands the dynamo will also be able to understand the\r\nelectric motor, which is merely a reversed dynamo.\r\n\r\nImagine in Fig. 70 a dynamo taking the place of the lamp and passing\r\ncurrent through the brushes and commutator into the coil _w x y z_. Now,\r\nany coil through which current passes becomes a magnet with N. and S.\r\npoles at either end. (In Fig. 70 we will assume that the N. pole is\r\nbelow and the S. pole above the coil.) The coil poles therefore try to\r\nseek the contrary poles of the permanent magnet, and the coil revolves\r\nuntil its S. pole faces the N. of the magnet, and _vice versâ_. The\r\nlines of force of the coil and the magnet are now parallel. But the\r\nmomentum of revolution carries the coil on, and suddenly the commutator\r\nreverses its polarity, and a further half-revolution takes place. Then\r\ncomes a further reversal, and so on _ad infinitum_. The rotation of the\r\nmotor is therefore merely a question of repulsion and attraction of like\r\nand unlike poles. An ordinary compass needle may be converted into a\r\ntiny motor by presenting the N. and S. poles of a magnet to its S. and\r\nN. poles alternately every half-revolution.\r\n\r\nIn construction and winding a motor is practically the same as a dynamo.\r\nIn fact, either machine can perform either function, though perhaps not\r\nequally well adapted for both. Motors may be run with direct or\r\nalternating current, according to their construction.\r\n\r\nOn electric cars the motor is generally suspended from the wheel truck,\r\nand a small pinion on the armature shaft gears with a large pinion on a\r\nwheel axle. One great advantage of electric traction is that every\r\nvehicle of a train can carry its own motor, so that the whole weight of\r\nthe train may be used to get a grip on the rails when starting. Where a\r\nsingle steam locomotive is used, the adhesion of its driving-wheels only\r\nis available for overcoming the inertia of the load; and the whole\r\nstrain of starting is thrown on to the foremost couplings. Other\r\nadvantages may be summed up as follows:--(1) Ease of starting and rapid\r\nacceleration; (2) absence of waste of energy (in the shape of burning\r\nfuel) when the vehicles are at rest; (3) absence of smoke and smell.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LIGHTING.\r\n\r\nDynamos are used to generate current for two main purposes--(1) To\r\nsupply power to motors of all kinds; (2) to light our houses, factories,\r\nand streets. In private houses and theatres incandescent lamps are\r\ngenerally used; in the open air, in shops, and in larger buildings, such\r\nas railway stations, the arc lamp is more often found.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCANDESCENT LAMP.\r\n\r\nIf you take a piece of very fine iron wire and lay it across the\r\nterminals of an accumulator, it becomes white hot and melts, owing to\r\nthe heat generated by its resistance to the current. A piece of fine\r\nplatinum wire would become white hot without melting, and would give out\r\nan intense light. Here we have the principle of the glow or incandescent\r\nlamp--namely, the interposition in an electric circuit of a conductor\r\nwhich at once offers a high resistance to the current, but is not\r\ndestroyed by the resulting heat.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 80 is shown a fan propelling liquid constantly through a pipe.\r\nLet us assume that the liquid is one which develops great friction on\r\nthe inside of the pipe. At the contraction, where the speed of travel\r\nis much greater than elsewhere in the circuit, most heat will be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Diagram to show circulation of water through a\r\npipe.]\r\n\r\nIn quite the early days of the glow-lamp platinum wire was found to be\r\nunreliable as regards melting, and filaments of carbon are now used. To\r\nprevent the wasting away of the carbon by combination with oxygen the\r\nfilament is enclosed in a glass bulb from which practically all air has\r\nbeen sucked by a mercury pump before sealing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--The electrical counterpart of Fig. 80. The\r\nfilament takes the place of the contraction in the pipe.]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of glow-lamps is now an important industry. One brand of\r\nlamp[20] is made as follows:--First, cotton-wool is dissolved in\r\nchloride of zinc, and forms a treacly solution, which is squirted\r\nthrough a fine nozzle into a settling solution which hardens it and\r\nmakes it coil up like a very fine violin string. After being washed and\r\ndried, it is wound on a plumbago rod and baked in a furnace until only\r\nthe carbon element remains. This is the filament in the rough. It is\r\nnext removed from the rod and tipped with two short pieces of fine\r\nplatinum wire. To make the junction electrically perfect the filament is\r\nplunged in benzine and heated to whiteness by the passage of a strong\r\ncurrent, which deposits the carbon of the benzine on the joints. The\r\nfilament is now placed under the glass receiver of an air-pump, the air\r\nis exhausted, hydro-carbon vapour is introduced, and the filament has a\r\ncurrent passed through it to make it white hot. Carbon from the vapour\r\nis deposited all over the filament until the required electrical\r\nresistance is attained. The filament is now ready for enclosure in the\r\nbulb. When the bulb has been exhausted and sealed, the lamp is tested,\r\nand, if passed, goes to the finishing department, where the two platinum\r\nwires (projecting through the glass) are soldered to a couple of brass\r\nplates, which make contact with two terminals in a lamp socket. Finally,\r\nbrass caps are affixed with a special water-tight and hard cement.\r\n\r\n\r\nARC LAMPS.\r\n\r\nIn _arc_ lighting, instead of a contraction at a point in the circuit,\r\nthere is an actual break of very small extent. Suppose that to the ends\r\nof the wires leading from a dynamo's terminals we attach two carbon\r\nrods, and touch the end of the rods together. The tips become white hot,\r\nand if they are separated slightly, atoms of incandescent carbon leap\r\nfrom the positive to the negative rod in a continuous and intensely\r\nluminous stream, which is called an _arc_ because the path of the\r\nparticles is curved. No arc would be formed unless the carbons were\r\nfirst touched to start incandescence. If they are separated too far for\r\nthe strength of the current to bridge the gap the light will flicker or\r\ngo out. The arc lamp is therefore provided with a mechanism which, when\r\nthe current is cut off, causes the carbons to fall together, gradually\r\nseparates them when it is turned on, and keeps them apart. The principle\r\nemployed is the effort of a coil through which a current passes to draw\r\nan iron rod into its centre. Some of the current feeding the lamp is\r\nshunted through a coil, into which projects one end of an iron bar\r\nconnected with one carbon point. A spring normally presses the points\r\ntogether when no current flows. As soon as current circulates through\r\nthe coil the bar is drawn upwards against the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES AND PARALLEL ARRANGEMENT OF LAMPS.\r\n\r\nWhen current passes from one lamp to another, as in Fig. 82, the lamps\r\nare said to be in _series_. Should one lamp fail, all in the circuit\r\nwould go out. But where arc lamps are thus arranged a special mechanism\r\non each lamp \"short-circuits\" it in case of failure, so that current may\r\npass uninterruptedly to the next.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Incandescent lamps connected in \"series.\"]\r\n\r\nFig. 83 shows a number of lamps set _in parallel_. One terminal of each\r\nis attached to the positive conductor, the other to the negative\r\nconductor. Each lamp therefore forms an independent bridge, and does\r\nnot affect the efficiency of the rest. _Parallel series_ signifies a\r\ncombination of the two systems, and would be illustrated if, in Fig. 83,\r\ntwo or more lamps were connected in series groups from one conductor to\r\nthe other. This arrangement is often used in arc lighting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Incandescent lamps connected in \"parallel.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENT FOR ELECTRIC LAMPS.\r\n\r\nThis may be either direct or alternating. The former is commonly used\r\nfor arc lamps, the latter for incandescent, as it is easily stepped-down\r\nfrom the high-pressure mains for use in a house. Glow-lamps usually take\r\ncurrent of 110 or 250 volts pressure.\r\n\r\nIn arc lamps fed with direct current the tip of the positive carbon has\r\na bowl-shaped depression worn in it, while the negative tip is pointed.\r\nMost of the illumination comes from the inner surface of the bowl, and\r\nthe positive carbon is therefore placed uppermost to throw the light\r\ndownwards. An alternating current, of course, affects both carbons in\r\nthe same manner, and there is no bowl.\r\n\r\nThe carbons need frequent renewal. A powerful lamp uses about 70 feet of\r\nrod in 1,000 hours if the arc is exposed to the air. Some lamps have\r\npartly enclosed arcs--that is, are surrounded by globes perforated by a\r\nsingle small hole, which renders combustion very slow, though preventing\r\na vacuum.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROPLATING.\r\n\r\nElectroplating is the art of coating metals with metals by means of\r\nelectricity. Silver, copper, and nickel are the metals most generally\r\ndeposited. The article to be coated is suspended in a chemical solution\r\nof the metal to be deposited. Fig. 84 shows a very simple plating\r\noutfit. A is a battery; B a vessel containing, say, an acidulated\r\nsolution of sulphate of copper. A spoon, S, hanging in this from a glass\r\nrod, R, is connected with the zinc or negative element, Z, of the\r\nbattery, and a plate of copper, P, with the positive element, C. Current\r\nflows in the direction shown by the arrows, from Z to C, C to P, P to\r\nS, S to Z. The copper deposited from the solution on the spoon is\r\nreplaced by gradual dissolution of the plate, so that the latter serves\r\na double purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--An electroplating outfit.]\r\n\r\nIn silver plating, P is of silver, and the solution one of cyanide of\r\npotassium and silver salts. Where nickel or silver has to be deposited\r\non iron, the article is often given a preliminary coating of copper, as\r\niron does not make a good junction with either of the first two metals,\r\nbut has an affinity for copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] From the Latin _commuto_, \"I exchange.\"\r\n\r\n[18] Only the \"drum\" type of armature is treated here.\r\n\r\n[19] This refers to continuous-current dynamos only.\r\n\r\n[20] The Robertson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\nRAILWAY BRAKES.\r\n\r\n     The Vacuum Automatic brake--The Westinghouse air-brake.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the railway, the pulling up of a train necessitated\r\nthe shutting off of steam while the stopping-place was still a great\r\ndistance away. The train gradually lost its velocity, the process being\r\nhastened to a comparatively small degree by the screw-down brakes on the\r\nengine and guard's van. The goods train of to-day in many cases still\r\nobserves this practice, long obsolete in passenger traffic.\r\n\r\nAn advance was made when a chain, running along the entire length of the\r\ntrain, was arranged so as to pull on subsidiary chains branching off\r\nunder each carriage and operating levers connected with brake blocks\r\npressing on every pair of wheels. The guard strained the main chain by\r\nmeans of a wheel gear in his van. This system was, however, radically\r\ndefective, since, if any one branch chain was shorter than the rest, it\r\nalone would get the strain. Furthermore, it is obvious that the snapping\r\nof the main chain would render the whole arrangement powerless.\r\nAccordingly, brakes operated by steam were tried. Under every carriage\r\nwas placed a cylinder, in connection with a main steam-pipe running\r\nunder the train. When the engineer wished to apply the brakes, he turned\r\nhigh-pressure steam into the train pipe, and the steam, passing into the\r\nbrake cylinders, drove out in each a piston operating the brake gear.\r\nUnfortunately, the steam, during its passage along the pipe, was\r\ncondensed, and in cold weather failed to reach the rear carriages. Water\r\nformed in the pipes, and this was liable to freeze. If the train parted\r\naccidentally, the apparatus of course broke down.\r\n\r\nHydraulic brakes have been tried; but these are open to several\r\nobjections; and railway engineers now make use of air-pressure as the\r\nmost suitable form of power. Whatever air system be adopted, experience\r\nhas shown that three features are essential:--(1.) The brakes must be\r\nkept \"off\" artificially. (2.) In case of the train parting accidentally,\r\nthe brakes must be applied automatically, and quickly bring all the\r\nvehicles of the train to a standstill. (3.) It must be possible to apply\r\nthe brakes with greater or less force, according to the needs of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAt the present day one or other of two systems is used on practically\r\nall automatically-braked cars and coaches. These are known as--(1) The\r\n_vacuum automatic_, using the pressure of the atmosphere on a piston\r\nfrom the other side of which air has been mechanically exhausted; and\r\n(2) the _Westinghouse automatic_, using compressed air. The action of\r\nthese brakes will now be explained as simply as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VACUUM AUTOMATIC BRAKE.\r\n\r\nUnder each carriage is a vacuum chamber (Fig. 85) riding on trunnions, E\r\nE, so that it may swing a little when the brakes are applied. Inside the\r\nchamber is a cylinder, the piston of which is rendered air-tight by a\r\nrubber ring rolling between it and the cylinder walls. The piston rod\r\nworks through an air-tight stuffing-box in the bottom of the casing, and\r\nwhen it rises operates the brake rods. It is obvious that if air is\r\nexhausted from both sides of the piston at once, the piston will sink by\r\nreason of its own weight and that of its attachments. If air is now\r\nadmitted below the piston, the latter will be pushed upwards with a\r\nmaximum pressure of 15 lbs. to the square inch. The ball-valve ensures\r\nthat while air can be sucked from _both_ sides of the piston, it can be\r\nadmitted to the lower side only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Vacuum brake \"off.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Vacuum brake \"on.\"]\r\n\r\nLet us imagine that a train has been standing in a siding, and that air\r\nhas gradually filled the vacuum chamber by leakage. The engine is\r\ncoupled on, and the driver at once turns on the steam ejector,[21]\r\nwhich sucks all the air out of the pipes and chambers throughout the\r\ntrain. The air is sucked directly from the under side of the piston\r\nthrough pipe D; and from the space A A and the cylinder (open at the\r\ntop) through the channel C, lifting the ball, which, as soon as\r\nexhaustion is complete, or when the pressure on both sides of the piston\r\nis equal, falls back on its seat. On air being admitted to the train\r\npipe, it rushes through D and into the space B (Fig. 86) below the\r\npiston, but is unable to pass the ball, so that a strong upward pressure\r\nis exerted on the piston, and the brakes go on. To throw them off, the\r\nspace below the piston must be exhausted. This is to be noted: If there\r\nis a leak, as in the case of the train parting, _the brakes go on at\r\nonce_, since the vacuum below the piston is automatically broken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Guard's valve for applying the Vacuum brake.]\r\n\r\nFor ordinary stops the vacuum is only partially broken--that is, an\r\nair-pressure of but from 5 to 10 lbs. per square inch is admitted. For\r\nemergency stops full atmospheric pressure is used. In this case it is\r\nadvisable that air should enter at _both_ ends of the train; so in the\r\nguard's van there is installed an ingenious automatic valve, which can\r\nat any time be opened by the guard pressing down a lever, but which\r\nopens of itself when the train-pipe vacuum is rapidly destroyed. Fig. 87\r\nshows this device in section. Seated on the top of an upright pipe is a\r\nvalve, _A_, connected by a bolt, B, to an elastic diaphragm, C, sealing\r\nthe bottom of the chamber D. The bolt B has a very small hole bored\r\nthrough it from end to end. When the vacuum is broken slowly, the\r\npressure falls in D as fast as in the pipe; but a sudden inrush of air\r\ncauses the valve A to be pulled off its seat by the diaphragm C, as the\r\nvacuum in D has not been broken to any appreciable extent. Air then\r\nrushes into the train pipe through the valve. It is thus evident that\r\nthe driver controls this valve as effectively as if it were on the\r\nengine. These \"emergency\" valves are sometimes fitted to every vehicle\r\nof a train.\r\n\r\nWhen a carriage is slipped, taps on each side of the coupling joint of\r\nthe train pipe are turned off by the guard in the \"slip;\" and when he\r\nwishes to stop he merely depresses the lever E, gradually opening the\r\nvalve. Under the van is an auxiliary vacuum chamber, from which the air\r\nis exhausted by the train pipe. If the guard, after the slip has parted\r\nfrom the train, finds that he has applied his brakes too hard, he can\r\nput this chamber into communication with the brake cylinder, and restore\r\nthe vacuum sufficiently to pull the brakes off again.\r\n\r\nWhen a train has come to rest, the brakes must be sucked off by the\r\nejector. Until this has been done the train cannot be moved, so that it\r\nis impossible for it to leave the station unprepared to make a sudden\r\nstop if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WESTINGHOUSE AIR-BRAKE.\r\n\r\nThis system is somewhat more complicated than the vacuum, though equally\r\nreliable and powerful. Owing to the complexity of certain parts, such as\r\nthe steam air-pump and the triple-valve, it is impossible to explain the\r\nsystem in detail; we therefore have recourse to simple diagrammatic\r\nsketches, which will help to make clear the general principles employed.\r\n\r\nThe air-brake, as first evolved by Mr. George Westinghouse, was a very\r\nsimple affair--an air-pump and reservoir on the engine; a long pipe\r\nrunning along the train; and a cylinder under every vehicle to work the\r\nbrakes. To stop the train, the high-pressure air collected in the\r\nreservoir was turned into the train pipe to force out the pistons in the\r\ncoach cylinders, connected to it by short branch pipes. One defect of\r\nthis \"straight\" system was that the brakes at the rear of a long train\r\ndid not come into action until a considerable time after the driver\r\nturned on the air; and since, when danger is imminent, a very few\r\nseconds are of great importance, this slowness of operation was a\r\nserious fault. Also, it was found that the brakes on coaches near the\r\nengine went on long before those more distant, so that during a quick\r\nstop there was a danger of the forward coaches being bumped by those\r\nbehind. It goes without saying that any coaches which might break loose\r\nwere uncontrollable. Mr. Westinghouse therefore patented his _automatic_\r\nbrake, now so largely used all over the world. The brake ensures\r\npractically instantaneous and simultaneous action on all the vehicles of\r\n_a train of any length_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Diagrammatic sketch of the details of the\r\nWestinghouse air-brake. Brake \"off.\"]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the brake will be gathered from Figs. 88 and 89. P is a\r\nsteam-driven air-pump on the engine, which compresses air into a\r\nreservoir, A, situated below the engine or tender, and maintains a\r\npressure of from 80 to 90 lbs. per square inch. A three-way cock, C,\r\nputs the train pipe into communication with A or the open air at the\r\nwish of the driver. Under each coach is a triple-valve, T, an auxiliary\r\nreservoir, B, and a brake cylinder, D. The triple-valve is the most\r\nnoteworthy feature of the whole system. The reader must remember that\r\nthe valve shown in the section is _only diagrammatic_.\r\n\r\nNow for the operation of the brake. When the engine is coupled to the\r\ntrain, the compressed air in the main reservoir is turned into the train\r\npipe, from which it passes through the triple-valve into the auxiliary\r\nreservoir, and fills it till it has a pressure of, say, 80 lbs. per\r\nsquare inch. Until the brakes are required, the pressure in the train\r\npipe must be maintained. If accidentally, or purposely (by turning the\r\ncock C to the position shown in Fig. 89), the train-pipe pressure is\r\nreduced, the triple-valve at once shifts, putting B in connection with\r\nthe brake cylinder D, and cutting off the connection between D and the\r\nair, and the brakes go on. To get them off, the pressure in the train\r\npipe must be made equal to that in B, when the valve will assume its\r\noriginal position, allowing the air in D to escape.\r\n\r\nThe force with which the brake is applied depends upon the reduction of\r\npressure in the train pipe. A slight reduction would admit air very\r\nslowly from B to D, whereas a full escape from the train pipe would open\r\nthe valve to its utmost. We have not represented the means whereby the\r\nvalve is rendered sensitive to these changes, for the reason given\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Brake \"on.\"]\r\n\r\nThe latest form of triple-valve includes a device which, when air is\r\nrapidly discharged from the train pipe, as in an emergency application\r\nof the brake, opens a port through which compressed air is also admitted\r\nfrom the train pipe _directly_ into D. It will easily be understood that\r\na double advantage is hereby gained--first, in utilizing a considerable\r\nportion of the air in the train pipe to increase the available brake\r\nforce in cases of emergency; and, secondly, in producing a quick\r\nreduction of pressure in the whole length of the pipe, which accelerates\r\nthe action of the brakes with extraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that this secondary communication is kept open only\r\nuntil the pressure in D is equal to that in the train pipe. Then it is\r\ncut off, to prevent a return of air from B to the pipe.\r\n\r\nAn interesting detail of the system is the automatic regulation of\r\nair-pressure in the main reservoir by the air-pump governor (Fig. 90).\r\nThe governor is attached to the steam-pipe leading from the locomotive\r\nboiler to the air-pump. Steam from the boiler, entering at F, flows\r\nthrough valve 14 and passes by D into the pump, which is thus brought\r\ninto operation, and continues to work until the pressure in the main\r\nreservoir, acting on the under side of the diaphragm 9, exceeds the\r\ntension to which the regulating spring 7 is set. Any excess of pressure\r\nforces the diaphragm upwards, lifting valve 11, and allowing compressed\r\nair from the main reservoir to flow into the chamber C. The air-pressure\r\nforces piston 12 downwards and closes steam-valve 14, thus cutting off\r\nthe supply of steam to the pump. As soon as the pressure in the\r\nreservoir is reduced (by leakage or use) below the normal, spring 7\r\nreturns diaphragm 9 to the position shown in Fig. 90, and pin-valve 11\r\ncloses. The compressed air previously admitted to the chamber C escapes\r\nthrough the small port _a_ to the atmosphere. The steam, acting on the\r\nlower surface of valve 14, lifts it and its piston to the position\r\nshown, and again flows to the pump, which works until the required\r\nair-pressure is again obtained in the reservoir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Air-pump of Westinghouse brake.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[21] This resembles the upper part of the rudimentary water injector\r\nshown in Fig. 15. The reader need only imagine pipe B to be connected\r\nwith the train pipe. A rush of steam through pipe A creates a partial\r\nvacuum in the cone E, causing air from the train pipe to rush into it\r\nand be expelled by the steam blast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\nRAILWAY SIGNALLING.\r\n\r\n     The block system--Position of signals--Interlocking the\r\n     signals--Locking gear--Points--Points and signals in\r\n     combination--Working the block system--Series of signalling\r\n     operations--Single line signals--The train staff--Train staff and\r\n     ticket--Electric train staff system--Interlocking--Signalling\r\n     operations--Power signalling--Pneumatic signalling--Automatic\r\n     signalling.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions--namely, at sharp curves or in darkness--the\r\nmost powerful brakes might not avail to prevent a train running into the\r\nrear of another, if trains were allowed to follow each other closely\r\nover the line. It is therefore necessary to introduce an effective\r\nsystem of keeping trains running in the same direction a sufficient\r\ndistance apart, and this is done by giving visible and easily understood\r\norders to the driver while a train is in motion.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the railway it was customary to allow a time\r\ninterval between the passings of trains, a train not being permitted to\r\nleave a station until at least five minutes after the start of a\r\npreceding train. This method did not, of course, prevent collisions, as\r\nthe first train sometimes broke down soon after leaving the station; and\r\nin the absence of effective brakes, its successor ran into it. The\r\nadvent of the electric telegraph, which put stations in rapid\r\ncommunication with one another, proved of the utmost value to the safe\r\nworking of railways.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLOCK SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nTime limits were abolished and distance limits substituted. A line was\r\ndivided into _blocks_, or lengths, and two trains going in the same\r\ndirection were never allowed on any one block at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe signal-posts carrying the movable arms, or semaphores, by means of\r\nwhich the signalman communicates with the engine-driver, are well known\r\nto us. They are usually placed on the left-hand side of the line of\r\nrails to which they apply, with their arms pointing away from the rails.\r\nThe side of the arms which faces the direction from which a train\r\napproaches has a white stripe painted on a red background, the other\r\nside has a black stripe on a white background.\r\n\r\nThe distant and other signal arms vary slightly in shape (Fig. 91). A\r\ndistant signal has a forked end and a V-shaped stripe; the home and\r\nstarting signals are square-ended, with straight stripes. When the arm\r\nstands horizontally, the signal is \"on,\" or at \"danger\"; when dropped,\r\nit is \"off,\" and indicates \"All right; proceed.\" At the end nearest the\r\npost it carries a spectacle frame glazed with panes of red and green\r\nglass. When the arm is at danger, the red pane is opposite a lamp\r\nattached to the signal post; when the arm drops, the green pane rises to\r\nthat position--so that a driver is kept as fully informed at night as\r\nduring the day, provided the lamp remains alight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Distant and home signals.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF SIGNALS.\r\n\r\nOn double lines each set of rails has its own separate signals, and\r\ndrivers travelling on the \"up\" line take no notice of signals meant for\r\nthe \"down\" line. Each signal-box usually controls three signals on each\r\nset of rails--the distant, the home, and the starting. Their respective\r\npositions will be gathered from Fig. 92, which shows a station on a\r\ndouble line. Between the distant and the home an interval is allowed of\r\n800 yards on the level, 1,000 yards on a falling gradient, and 600 yards\r\non a rising gradient. The home stands near the approach end of the\r\nstation, and the starting at the departure end of the platform. The last\r\nis sometimes reinforced by an \"advance starting\" signal some distance\r\nfarther on.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the distant is only a _caution_ signal, whereas\r\nboth home and starting are _stop_ signals. This means that when the\r\ndriver sees the distant \"on,\" he does not stop his train, but slackens\r\nspeed, and prepares to stop at the home signal. He must, however, on no\r\naccount pass either home or starting if they are at danger. In short,\r\nthe distant merely warns the driver of what he may expect at the home.\r\nTo prevent damage if a driver should overrun the home, it has been laid\r\ndown that no train shall be allowed to pass the starting signal of one\r\nbox unless the line is clear to a point at least a quarter of a mile\r\nbeyond the home of the next box. That point is called the _standard\r\nclearing point_.\r\n\r\nTechnically described, a _block_ is a length of line between the last\r\nstop signal worked from one signal-box and the first stop signal worked\r\nfrom the next signal-box in advance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Showing position of signals. Those at the top\r\nare \"off.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERLOCKING SIGNALS.\r\n\r\nA signalman cannot lower or restore his signals to their normal\r\npositions in any order he likes. He is compelled to lower them as\r\nfollows:--Starting and home; _then_ distant. And restore them--distant;\r\n_then_ starting and home. If a signalman were quite independent, he\r\nmight, after the passage of a train, restore the home or starting, but\r\nforget all about the distant, so that the next train, which he wants to\r\nstop, would dash past the distant without warning and have to pull up\r\nsuddenly when the home came in sight. But by a mechanical arrangement he\r\nis prevented from restoring the home or starting until the distant is\r\nat danger; and, _vice versâ_, he cannot lower the last until the other\r\ntwo are off. This mechanism is called _locking gear_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOKING GEAR.\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of locking gear in use. It is impossible\r\nto describe them all, or even to give particulars of an elaborate\r\nlocking-frame of any one type. But if we confine ourselves to the\r\nsimplest combination of a stud-locking apparatus, such as is used in\r\nsmall boxes on the Great Western Railway, the reader will get an insight\r\ninto the general principles of these safety devices, as the same\r\nprinciples underlie them all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--A signal lever and its connections. To move the\r\nlever, C is pressed towards B raising the catch-rod from its nick in the\r\nrack, G G G, guides; R R, anti-friction rollers; S, sockets for\r\ncatch-rod to work in.]\r\n\r\nThe levers in the particular type of locking gear which we are\r\nconsidering have each a tailpiece or \"tappet arm\" attached to it, which\r\nmoves backwards and forwards with the lever (Fig. 93). Running at right\r\nangles to this tappet, and close to it, either under or above, are the\r\nlock bars, or stud bars. Refer now to Fig. 94, which shows the ends of\r\nthe three tappet arms, D, H, and S, crossed by a bar, B, from which\r\nproject these studs. The levers are all forward and the signals all\r\n\"on.\" If the signalman tried to pull the lever attached to D down the\r\npage, as it were, he would fail to move it on account of the stud _a_,\r\nwhich engages with a notch in D. Before this stud can be got free of the\r\nnotch the tappets H and S must be pulled over, so as to bring their\r\nnotches in line with studs _b_ and _c_ (Fig. 95). The signalman can now\r\nmove D, since the notch easily pushes the stud _a_ to the left (Fig.\r\n96). The signals must be restored to danger. As H and S are back-locked\r\nby D--that is, prevented by D from being put back into their normal\r\npositions--D must be moved first. The interlocking of the three signals\r\ndescribed is merely repeated in the interlocking of a large number of\r\nsignals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.]\r\n\r\nOn entering a signal-box a visitor will notice that the levers have\r\ndifferent colours:--_Green_, signifying distant signals; _red_,\r\nsignifying home and starting signals; _blue_, signifying facing points;\r\n_black_, signifying trailing points; _white_, signifying spare levers.\r\nThese different colours help the signalman to pick out the right levers\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nTo the front of each lever is attached a small brass tablet bearing\r\ncertain numbers; one in large figures on the top, then a line, and other\r\nnumbers in small figures beneath. The large number is that of the lever\r\nitself; the others, called _leads_, refer to levers which must be pulled\r\nbefore that particular lever can be released.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Model signal equipment in a signalling school.\r\n(By permission of the \"G.W.R. Magazine\").]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS.\r\n\r\nMention was made, in connection with the lever, of _points_. Before\r\ngoing further we will glance at the action of these devices for enabling\r\na train to run from one set of rails to another. Figs. 98 and 99 show\r\nthe points at a simple junction. It will be noticed that the rails of\r\nthe line to the left of the points are continued as the outer rails of\r\nthe main and branch lines. The inner rails come to a sharp V-point, and\r\nto the left of this are the two short rails which, by means of shifting\r\nportions, decide the direction of a train's travel. In Fig. 98 the main\r\nline is open; in Fig. 99, the branch. The shifting parts are kept\r\nproperly spaced by cross bars (or tie-rods), A A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--Points open to main line.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Points open to branch line.]\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that the wheels would bump badly when they reach\r\nthe point B, where there is a gap. This is prevented, however, by the\r\nbent ends E E (Fig. 98), on which the tread of the wheel rests until it\r\nhas reached some distance along the point of V. The safety rails S R\r\nkeep the outer wheel up against its rail until the V has been passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND SIGNALS IN COMBINATION.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a train is approaching the junction shown in Figs.\r\n98 and 99 from the left. It is not enough that the driver should know\r\nthat the tracks are clear. He must also be assured that the track, main\r\nor branch, as the case may be, along which he has to go, is open; and on\r\nthe other hand, if he were approaching from the right, he would want to\r\nbe certain that no train on the other line was converging on his. Danger\r\nis avoided and assurance given by interlocking the points and signals.\r\nTo the left of the junction the home and distant signals are doubled,\r\nthere being two semaphore arms on each post. These are interlocked with\r\nthe points in such a manner that the signals referring to either line\r\ncan be pulled off only when the points are set to open the way to that\r\nline. Moreover, before any shifting of points can be made, the signals\r\nbehind must be put to danger. The convergence of trains is prevented by\r\ninterlocking, which renders it impossible to have both sets of distant\r\nand home signals at \"All right\" simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING OF BLOCK SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nWe may now pass to the working of the block system of signalling trains\r\nfrom station to station on one line of a double track. Each signal-box\r\n(except, of course, those at termini) has electric communication with\r\nthe next box in both directions. The instruments used vary on different\r\nsystems, but the principle is the same; so we will concentrate our\r\nattention on those most commonly employed on the Great Western Railway.\r\nThey are:--(1.) Two tapper-bell instruments, connected with similar\r\ninstruments in the adjacent boxes on both sides. Each of these rings one\r\nbeat in the corresponding box every time its key is depressed. (2.) Two\r\nSpagnoletti disc instruments--one, having two keys, communicating with\r\nthe box in the rear; and the other, in connection with the forward box,\r\nhaving no keys. Their respective functions are to give signals and\r\nreceive them. In the centre of the face of each is a square opening,\r\nbehind which moves a disc carrying two \"flags\"--\"Train on line\" in white\r\nletters on red ground, and \"Line clear\" in black letters on a white\r\nground. The keyed instrument has a red and a white key. When the red key\r\nis depressed, \"Train on line\" appears at the opening; also in that of a\r\nkeyless disc at the adjacent signal-box. A depression of the white key\r\nsimilarly gives \"Line clear.\" A piece of wire with the ends turned over\r\nand passed through two eyes slides over the keys, and can be made to\r\nhold either down. In addition to these, telephonic and telegraphic\r\ninstruments are provided to enable the signalmen to converse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES OF SIGNALLING OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--The signaling instruments in three adjacent\r\ncabins. The featherless arrows show the connection of the instruments.]\r\n\r\nWe may now watch the doings of signalmen in four successive boxes, A,\r\nB, C, and D, during the passage of an express train. Signalman A calls\r\nsignalman B's attention by one beat on the tapper-bell. B answers by\r\nrepeating it to show that he is attending. A asks, \"Is line clear for\r\npassenger express?\"--four beats on the bell. B, seeing that the line is\r\nclear to his clearing point, sends back four beats, and pins down the\r\nwhite key of his instrument. \"Line clear\" appears on the opening, and\r\nalso at that of A's keyless disc. A lowers starting signal. Train moves\r\noff. A gives two beats on the tapper = \"Train entering section.\" B pins\r\nindicator at \"Train on line,\" which also appears on A's instrument. A\r\nplaces signals at danger. B asks C, \"Is line clear?\" C repeats the bell\r\ncode, and pins indicator at \"Line clear,\" shown on B's keyless disc\r\nalso. B lowers all signals. Train passes. B signals to C, \"Train\r\nentering section.\" B signals to A, \"Train out of section,\" and releases\r\nindicator, which returns to normal position with half of each flag\r\nshowing at the window. B signals to C, \"Train on line,\" and sets all his\r\nsignals to danger. C pins indicator to \"Train on line.\" C asks, \"Is line\r\nclear?\" But there is a train at station D, and signalman D therefore\r\ngives no reply, which is equivalent to a negative. The driver, on\r\napproaching C's distant, sees it at danger, and slows down, stopping at\r\nthe home. C lowers home, and allows train to proceed to his starting\r\nsignal. D, when the line is clear to his clearing point, signals \"Line\r\nclear,\" and pins indicator at \"Line clear.\" C lowers starting signals,\r\nand train proceeds. C signals to D, \"Train entering section,\" and D pins\r\nindicator at \"Train on line.\" C signals to B, \"Train out of section,\"\r\nsets indicator at normal, and puts signals at danger. And so the process\r\nis repeated from station to station. Where, however, sections are short,\r\nthe signalman is advised one section ahead of the approach of a train by\r\nan additional signal signifying, \"Fast train approaching.\" The block\r\nindicator reminds the signalman of the whereabouts of the train. Unless\r\nhis keyless indicator is at normal, he may not ask, \"Is line clear?\" And\r\nuntil he signals back \"Line clear\" to the box behind, a train is not\r\nallowed to enter his section. In this way a section of line with a full\r\ncomplement of signals is always interposed between any two trains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORKING OF SINGLE LINES.\r\n\r\nWe have dealt with the signalling arrangements pertaining to double\r\nlines of railway, showing that a system of signals is necessary to\r\nprevent a train running into the back of its predecessor. Where trains\r\nin both directions pass over a single line, not only has this element of\r\ndanger to be dealt with, but also the possibility of a train being\r\nallowed to enter a section of line from each end _at the same time_.\r\nThis is effected in several ways, the essence of each being that the\r\nengine-driver shall have in his possession _visible_ evidence of the\r\npermission accorded him by the signalman to enter a section of single\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SINGLE TRAIN STAFF.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of working is to allocate to the length of line a\r\n\"train staff\"--a piece of wood about 14 inches long, bearing the names\r\nof the stations at either end. This is adopted where only one engine is\r\nused for working a section, such as a short branch line. In a case like\r\nthis there is obviously no danger of two trains meeting, and the train\r\nstaff is merely the authority to the driver to start a journey. No\r\ntelegraphic communication is necessary with such a system, and signals\r\nare placed only at the ends of the line.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAIN STAFF AND TICKET.\r\n\r\nOn long lengths of single line where more than one train has to be\r\nconsidered, the line is divided into blocks in the way already described\r\nfor double lines, and a staff is assigned to each, the staffs for the\r\nvarious blocks differing from each other in shape and colour. The usual\r\nsignals are provided at each station, and block telegraph instruments\r\nare employed, the only difference being that one disc, of the key\r\npattern, is used for trains in both directions. On such a line it is, of\r\ncourse, possible that two or more trains may require to follow each\r\nother without any travelling intermediately in the opposite direction.\r\nThis would be impossible if the staff passed uniformly to and fro in the\r\nblock section; but it is arranged by the introduction of a train staff\r\n_ticket_ used in conjunction with the staff.\r\n\r\nNo train is permitted to leave a staff station unless the staff for the\r\nsection of line to be traversed is at the station; and the driver has\r\nthe strictest possible instructions that he must _see_ the staff. If a\r\nsecond train is required to follow, the staff is _shown_ to the driver,\r\nand a train staff ticket handed him as his authority to proceed. If,\r\nhowever, the next train over the section will enter from the opposite\r\nend, the staff is _handed_ to the driver.\r\n\r\nTo render this system as safe as possible, train staff tickets are of\r\nthe same colour and shape as the staff for the section to which they\r\napply, and are kept in a special box at the stations, the key being\r\nattached to the staff and the lock so arranged that the key cannot be\r\nwithdrawn unless the box has been locked.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC TRAIN STAFF AND TABLET SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\nThese systems of working are developments of the last mentioned, by\r\nwhich are secured greater safety and ease in working the line. On some\r\nsections of single line circumstances often necessitate the running of\r\nseveral trains in one direction without a return train. For such cases\r\nthe train staff ticket was introduced; but even on the best regulated\r\nlines it is not always possible to secure that the staff shall be at the\r\nstation where it is required at the right time, and cases have arisen\r\nwhere, no train being available at the station where the staff was, it\r\nhad to be taken to the other station by a man on foot, causing much\r\ndelay to traffic. The electric train staff and tablet systems overcome\r\nthis difficulty. Both work on much the same principle, and we will\r\ntherefore describe the former.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--An electric train staff holder: S S, staffs\r\nin the slot of the instrument. Leaning against the side of the cabin is\r\na staff showing the key K at the end for unlocking a siding points\r\nbetween two stations. The engine driver cannot remove the staff until\r\nthe points have been locked again.]\r\n\r\nAt each end of a block section a train staff instrument (Fig. 101) is\r\nprovided. In the base of these instruments are a number of train staffs,\r\nany one of which would be accepted by an engine-driver as permission to\r\ntravel over the single line. The instruments are electrically connected,\r\nthe mechanism securing that a staff can be withdrawn only by the\r\nco-operation of the signalman at each end of the section; that, when\r\n_all_ the staffs are in the instruments, a staff may be withdrawn at\r\n_either_ end; that, when a staff has been withdrawn, another cannot be\r\nobtained until the one out has been restored to one or other of the\r\ninstruments. The safety of such a system is obvious, as also the\r\nassistance to the working by having a staff available for a train no\r\nmatter from which end it is to enter the section.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the instruments is quite simple. A double-poled\r\nelectro-magnet is energized by the depression of a key by the signalman\r\nat the further end of the block into which the train is to run, and by\r\nthe turning of a handle by the signalman who requires to withdraw a\r\nstaff. The magnet, being energized, is able to lift a mechanical lock,\r\nand permits the withdrawal of a staff. In its passage through the\r\ninstrument the staff revolves a number of iron discs, which in turn\r\nraise or lower a switch controlling the electrical connections. This\r\ncauses the electric currents actuating the electro-magnet to oppose\r\neach other, the magnetism to cease, and the lock to fall back,\r\npreventing another staff being withdrawn. It will naturally be asked,\r\n\"How is the electrical system restored?\" We have said that there were a\r\nnumber of staffs in each instrument--in other words, a given number of\r\nstaffs, usually twenty, is assigned to the section. Assume that there\r\nare ten in each instrument, and that the switch in each is in its lower\r\nposition. Now withdraw a staff, and one instrument has an odd, the other\r\nan even, number of staffs, and similarly one switch is raised while the\r\nother remains lowered, therefore the electrical circuit is \"out of\r\nphase\"--that is, the currents in the magnets of each staff instrument\r\nare opposed to one another, and cannot release the lock. The staff\r\ntravels through the section and is placed in the instrument at the other\r\nend, bringing the number of staffs to eleven--an odd number, and, what\r\nis more important, _raising_ the switch. Both switches are now raised,\r\nconsequently the electric currents will support each other, so that a\r\nstaff may be withdrawn. Briefly, then, when there is an odd number of\r\nstaffs in one instrument and an even number in the other, as when a\r\nstaff is in use, the signalmen are unable to obtain a staff, and\r\nconsequently cannot give authority for a train to enter the section; but\r\nwhen there is either an odd or an even number of staffs in each\r\ninstrument a staff may be withdrawn at either end on the co-operation of\r\nthe signalmen.\r\n\r\nWe may add that, where two instruments are in the same signal-box, one\r\nfor working to the box in advance, the other to the rear, it is arranged\r\nthat the staffs pertaining to one section shall not fit the instrument\r\nfor the other, and must be of different colours. This prevents the\r\ndriver accidentally accepting a staff belonging to one section as\r\nauthority to travel over the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERLOCKING.\r\n\r\nThe remarks made on the interlocking of points and signals on double\r\nlines apply also to the working of single lines, with the addition that\r\nnot only are the distant, home, and starting signals interlocked with\r\neach other, but with the signals and points governing the approach of a\r\ntrain from the opposite direction--in other words, the signals for the\r\napproach of a train to a station from one direction cannot be lowered\r\nunless those for the approach to the station of a train from the\r\nopposite direction are at danger, and the points correctly set.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNALLING OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the working of single lines, as of double, the signalman at the\r\nstation from which a train is to proceed has to obtain the consent of\r\nthe signalman ahead, the series of questions to be signalled being very\r\nsimilar to those detailed for double lines. There is, however, one\r\nnotable exception. On long lengths of single line it is necessary to\r\nmake arrangements for trains to pass each other. This is done by\r\nproviding loop lines at intervals, a second pair of rails being laid for\r\nthe accommodation of one train while another in the opposite direction\r\npasses it. To secure that more than one train shall not be on a section\r\nof single line between two crossing-places it is laid down that, when a\r\nsignalman at a non-crossing station is asked to allow a train to\r\napproach his station, he must not give permission until he has notified\r\nthe signalman ahead of him, thus securing that he is not asking\r\npermission for trains to approach from both directions at the same time.\r\nBoth for single and double line working a number of rules designed to\r\ndeal with cases of emergency are laid down, the guiding principle being\r\nsafety; but we have now dealt with all the conditions of everyday\r\nworking, and must pass to the consideration of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--An electric lever-frame in a signalling cabin\r\nat Didcot.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"POWER\" SIGNALLING.\r\n\r\nIn a power system of signalling the signalman is provided with some\r\nauxiliary means--electricity, compressed air, etc.--of moving the\r\nsignals or points under his control. It is still necessary to have a\r\nlocking-frame in the signal-box, with levers interlocked with each\r\nother, and connections between the box and the various points and\r\nsignals. But the frame is much smaller than an ordinary manual frame,\r\nand but little force is needed to move the little levers which make or\r\nbreak an electric circuit, or open an air-valve, according to the\r\npower-agent used.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC SIGNALLING.\r\n\r\nFig. 102 represents the locking-frame of a cabin at Didcot, England,\r\nwhere an all-electric system has been installed. Wires lead from the\r\ncabin to motors situated at the points and signals, which they operate\r\nthrough worm gearing. When a lever is moved it closes a circuit and sets\r\nthe current flowing through a motor, the direction of the flow (and\r\nconsequently of the motor's revolution) depending on whether the lever\r\nhas been moved forward or backward. Indicators arranged under the levers\r\ntell the signalman when the desired movements at the points and signals\r\nhave been completed. If any motion is not carried through, owing to\r\nfailure of the current or obstruction of the working parts, an electric\r\nlock prevents him continuing operations. Thus, suppose he has to open\r\nthe main line to an express, he is obliged by the mechanical\r\nlocking-frame to set all the points correctly before the signals can be\r\nlowered. He might move all the necessary levers in due order, yet one\r\nset of points might remain open, and, were the signals lowered, an\r\naccident would result. But this cannot happen, as the electric locks\r\nworked by the points in question block the signal levers, and until the\r\nfailure has been set right, the signals must remain at \"danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe point motors are connected direct to the points; but between a\r\nsignal motor and its arm there is an \"electric slot,\" consisting of a\r\npowerful electro-magnet which forms a link in the rod work. To lower a\r\nsignal it is necessary that the motor shall revolve and a control\r\ncurrent pass round the magnet to give it the requisite attractive force.\r\nIf no control current flows, as would happen were any pair of points not\r\nin their proper position, the motor can have no effect on the signal arm\r\nto lower it, owing to the magnet letting go its grip. Furthermore, if\r\nthe signal had been already lowered when the control current failed, it\r\nwould rise to \"danger\" automatically, as all signals are weighted to\r\nassume the danger position by gravity. The signal control currents can\r\nbe broken by the signalman moving a switch, so that in case of emergency\r\nall signals may be thrown simultaneously to danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMATIC SIGNALLING.\r\n\r\nIn England and the United States compressed air is also used to do the\r\nhard labour of the signalman for him. Instead of closing a circuit, the\r\nsignalman, by moving a lever half-way over, admits air to a pipe running\r\nalong the track to an air reservoir placed beside the points or signal\r\nto which the lever relates. The air opens a valve and puts the reservoir\r\nin connection with a piston operating the points or signal-arm, as the\r\ncase may be. This movement having been performed, another valve in the\r\nreservoir is opened, and air passes back through a second pipe to the\r\nsignal-box, where it opens a third valve controlling a piston which\r\ncompletes the movement of the lever, so showing the signalman that the\r\noperation is complete. With compressed air, as with electricity, a\r\nmechanical locking-frame is of course used.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC SIGNALLING.\r\n\r\nTo reduce expense, and increase the running speed on lines where the\r\nsections are short, the train is sometimes made to act as its own\r\nsignalman. The rails of each section are all bonded together so as to be\r\nin metallic contact, and each section is insulated from the two\r\nneighbouring sections. At the further end of a section is installed an\r\nelectric battery, connected to the rails, which lead the current back to\r\na magnet operating a signal stationed some distance back on the\r\npreceding section. As long as current flows the signal is held at \"All\r\nright.\" When a train enters the section the wheels and axles\r\nshort-circuit the current, so that it does not reach the signal magnet,\r\nand the signal rises to \"danger,\" and stays there until the last pair of\r\nwheels has passed out of the section. Should the current fail or a\r\nvehicle break loose and remain on the section, the same thing would\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nThe human element can thus be practically eliminated from signalling. To\r\nmake things absolutely safe, a train should have positive control over a\r\ntrain following, to prevent the driver overrunning the signals. On\r\nelectric railways this has been effected by means of contacts working\r\nin combination with the signals, which either cut the current off from\r\nthe section preceding that on which a train may be, or raise a trigger\r\nto strike an arm on the train following and apply its brakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\nOPTICS.\r\n\r\n     Lenses--The image cast by a convex lens--Focus--Relative position\r\n     of object and lens--Correction of lenses for colour--Spherical\r\n     aberration--Distortion of image--The human eye--The use of\r\n     spectacles--The blind spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nLight is a third form of that energy of which we have already treated\r\ntwo manifestations--heat and electricity. The distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic of ether light-waves is their extreme rapidity of\r\nvibration, which has been calculated to range from 700 billion movements\r\nper second for violet rays to 400 billion for red rays.\r\n\r\nIf a beam of white light be passed through a prism it is resolved into\r\nthe seven visible colours of the spectrum--violet, indigo, blue, green,\r\nyellow, orange, and red--in this order. The human eye is most sensitive\r\nto the yellow-red rays, a photographic plate to the green-violet rays.\r\n\r\nAll bodies fall into one of two classes--(1) _Luminous_--that is, those\r\nwhich are a _source_ of light, such as the sun, a candle flame, or a\r\nred-hot coal; and (2) _non-luminous_, which become visible only by\r\nvirtue of light which they receive from other bodies and reflect to our\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPAGATION OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nLight naturally travels in a straight line. It is deflected only when it\r\npasses from one transparent medium into another--for example, from air\r\nto water--and the mediums are of different densities. We may regard the\r\nsurface of a visible object as made up of countless points, from each of\r\nwhich a diverging pencil of rays is sent off through the ether.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENSES.\r\n\r\nIf a beam of light encounters a transparent glass body with non-parallel\r\nsides, the rays are deflected. The direction they take depends on the\r\nshape of the body, but it may be laid down as a rule that they are bent\r\ntoward the thicker part of the glass. The common burning-glass is well\r\nknown to us. We hold it up facing the sun to concentrate all the heat\r\nrays that fall upon it into one intensely brilliant spot, which speedily\r\nignites any inflammable substance on which it may fall (Fig. 103). We\r\nmay imagine that one ray passes from the centre of the sun through the\r\ncentre of the glass. This is undeflected; but all the others are bent\r\ntowards it, as they pass through the thinner parts of the lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Showing how a burning-glass concentrates the\r\nheat rays which fall upon it.]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted here that _sunlight_, as we call it, is accompanied\r\nby heat. A burning-glass is used to concentrate the _heat_ rays, not the\r\n_light_ rays, which, though they are collected too, have no igniting\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn photography we use a lens to concentrate light rays only. Such heat\r\nrays as may pass through the lens with them are not wanted, and as they\r\nhave no practical effect are not taken any notice of. To be of real\r\nvalue, a lens must be quite symmetrical--that is, the curve from the\r\ncentre to the circumference must be the same in all directions.\r\n\r\nThere are six forms of simple lenses, as given in Fig. 104. Nos. 1 and\r\n2 have one flat and one spherical surface. Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 have two\r\nspherical surfaces. When a lens is thicker at the middle than at the\r\nsides it is called a _convex_ lens; when thinner, a _concave_ lens. The\r\nnames of the various shapes are as follows:--No. 1, plano-convex; No. 2,\r\nplano-concave; No. 3, double convex; No. 4, double concave; No. 5,\r\nmeniscus; No. 6, concavo-convex. The thick-centre lenses, as we may term\r\nthem (Nos. 1, 3, 5), _concentrate_ a pencil of rays passing through\r\nthem; while the thin-centre lenses (Nos. 2, 4, 6) _scatter_ the rays\r\n(see Fig. 105).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Six forms of lenses.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMERA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.]\r\n\r\nWe said above that light is propagated in straight lines. To prove this\r\nis easy. Get a piece of cardboard and prick a hole in it. Set this up\r\nsome distance away from a candle flame, and hold behind it a piece of\r\ntissue paper. You will at once perceive a faint, upside-down image of\r\nthe flame on the tissue. Why is this? Turn for a moment to Fig. 106,\r\nwhich shows a \"pinhole\" camera in section. At the rear is a ground-glass\r\nscreen, B, to catch the image. Suppose that A is the lowest point of the\r\nflame. A pencil of rays diverging from it strikes the front of the\r\ncamera, which stops them all except the one which passes through the\r\nhole and makes a tiny luminous spot on B, _above_ the centre of the\r\nscreen, though A is below the axis of the camera. Similarly the tip of\r\nthe flame (above the axis) would be represented by a dot on the screen\r\nbelow its centre. And so on for all the millions of points of the flame.\r\nIf we were to enlarge the hole we should get a brighter image, but it\r\nwould have less sharp outlines, because a number of rays from every\r\npoint of the candle would reach the screen and be jumbled up with the\r\nrays of neighbouring pencils. Now, though a good, sharp photograph may\r\nbe taken through a pinhole, the time required is so long that\r\nphotography of this sort has little practical value. What we want is a\r\nlarge hole for the light to enter the camera by, and yet to secure a\r\ndistinct image. If we place a lens in the hole we can fulfil our wish.\r\nFig. 107 shows a lens in position, gathering up a number of rays from a\r\npoint, A, and focussing them on a point, B. If the lens has 1,000 times\r\nthe area of the pinhole, it will pass 1,000 times as many rays, and the\r\nimage of A will be impressed on a sensitized photographic plate 1,000\r\ntimes more quickly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMAGE CAST BY A CONVEX LENS.\r\n\r\nFig. 108 shows diagrammatically how a convex lens forms an image. From A\r\nand B, the extremities of the object, a simple ray is considered to pass\r\nthrough the centre of the lens. This is not deflected at all. Two other\r\nrays from the same points strike the lens above and below the centre\r\nrespectively. These are bent inwards and meet the central rays, or come\r\nto a focus with them at A^1 and B^1. In reality a countless number\r\nof rays would be transmitted from every point of the object and\r\ncollected to form the image.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Showing how an image is cast by a convex\r\nlens.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOCUS.\r\n\r\nWe must now take special notice of that word heard so often in\r\nphotographic talk--\"focus.\" What is meant by the focus or focal length\r\nof a lens? Well, it merely signifies the distance between the optical\r\ncentre of the lens and the plane in which the image is formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.]\r\n\r\nWe must here digress a moment to draw attention to the three simple\r\ndiagrams of Fig. 109. The object, O, in each case is assumed to be to\r\nthe right of the lens. In the topmost diagram the object is so far away\r\nfrom the lens that all rays coming from a single point in it are\r\npractically parallel. These converge to a focus at F. If the distance\r\nbetween F and the centre of the lens is six inches, we say that the\r\nlens has a six-inch focal length. The focal length of a lens is judged\r\nby the distance between lens and image when the object is far away. To\r\navoid confusion, this focal length is known as the _principal_ focus,\r\nand is denoted by the symbol f. In the middle diagram the object is\r\nquite near the lens, which has to deal with rays striking its nearer\r\nsurface at an acuter angle than before (reckoning from the centre). As\r\nthe lens can only deflect their path to a fixed degree, they will not,\r\nafter passing the lens, come together until they have reached a point,\r\nF^1, further from the lens than F. The nearer we approach O to the\r\nlens, the further away on the other side is the focal point, until a\r\ndistance equal to that of F from the lens is reached, when the rays\r\nemerge from the glass in a parallel pencil. The rays now come to a focus\r\nno longer, and there can be no image. If O be brought nearer than the\r\nfocal distance, the rays would _diverge_ after passing through the lens.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE POSITIONS OF OBJECT AND IMAGE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--Showing how the position of the image alters\r\nrelatively to the position of the object.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said above we deduce two main conclusions--(1.) The\r\nnearer an object is brought to the lens, the further away from the lens\r\nwill the image be. (2.) If the object approaches within the principal\r\nfocal distance of the lens, no image will be cast by the lens. To make\r\nthis plainer we append a diagram (Fig. 110), which shows five positions\r\nof an object and the relative positions of the image (in dotted lines).\r\nFirst, we note that the line A B, or A B^1, denotes the principal\r\nfocal length of the lens, and A C, or A C^1, denotes twice the focal\r\nlength. We will take the positions in order:--\r\n\r\n_Position I._ Object further away than 2_f_. Inverted image _smaller_\r\nthan object, at distance somewhat exceeding _f_.\r\n\r\n_Position II._ Object at distance = 2_f_. Inverted image at distance =\r\n2_f_, and of size equal to that of object.\r\n\r\n_Position III_ Object nearer than 2_f_. Inverted image further away than\r\n2_f_; _larger_ than the object.\r\n\r\n_Position IV._ Object at distance = _f_. As rays are parallel after\r\npassing the lens _no_ image is cast.\r\n\r\n_Position V._ Object at distance less than _f_. No real image--that is,\r\none that can be caught on a focussing screen--is now given by the lens,\r\nbut a magnified, erect, _virtual_ image exists on the same side of the\r\nlens as the object.\r\n\r\nWe shall refer to _virtual_ images at greater length presently. It is\r\nhoped that any reader who practises photography will now understand why\r\nit is necessary to rack his camera out beyond the ordinary focal\r\ndistance when taking objects at close quarters. From Fig. 110 he may\r\ngather one practically useful hint--namely, that to copy a diagram,\r\netc., full size, both it and the plate must be exactly 2_f_ from the\r\noptical centre of the lens. And it follows from this that the further he\r\ncan rack his camera out beyond 2_f_ the greater will be the possible\r\nenlargement of the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRECTION OF LENSES FOR COLOUR.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to the separation of the spectrum colours of white\r\nlight by a prism. Now, a lens is one form of prism, and therefore sorts\r\nout the colours. In Fig. 111 we assume that two parallel red rays and\r\ntwo parallel violet rays from a distant object pass through a lens. A\r\nlens has most bending effect on violet rays and least on red, and the\r\nother colours of the spectrum are intermediately influenced. For the\r\nsake of simplicity we have taken the two extremes only. You observe that\r\nthe point R, in which the red rays meet, is much further from the lens\r\nthan is V, the meeting-point of the violet rays. A photographer very\r\nseldom has to take a subject in which there are not objects of several\r\ndifferent colours, and it is obvious that if he used a simple lens like\r\nthat in Fig. 111 and got his red objects in good focus, the blue and\r\ngreen portions of his picture would necessarily be more or less out of\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.]\r\n\r\nThis defect can fortunately be corrected by the method shown in Fig.\r\n112. A _compound_ lens is needed, made up of a _crown_ glass convex\r\nelement, B, and a concave element, A, of _flint_ glass. For the sake of\r\nillustration the two parts are shown separated; in practice they would\r\nbe cemented together, forming one optical body, thicker in the centre\r\nthan at the edges--a meniscus lens in fact, since A is not so concave as\r\nB is convex. Now, it was discovered by a Mr. Hall many years ago that if\r\nwhite light passed through two similar prisms, one of flint glass the\r\nother of crown glass, the former had the greater effect in separating\r\nthe spectrum colours--that is, violet rays were bent aside more suddenly\r\ncompared with the red rays than happened with the crown-glass prism.\r\nLook at Fig. 112. The red rays passing through the flint glass are but\r\nlittle deflected, while the violet rays turn suddenly outwards. This is\r\njust what is wanted, for it counteracts the unequal inward refraction\r\nby B, and both sets of rays come to a focus in the same plane. Such a\r\nlens is called _achromatic_, or colourless. If you hold a common\r\nreading-glass some distance away from large print you will see that the\r\nletters are edged with coloured bands, proving that the lens is not\r\nachromatic. A properly corrected photographic lens would not show these\r\npretty edgings. Colour correction is necessary also for lenses used in\r\ntelescopes and microscopes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPHERICAL ABERRATION.\r\n\r\nA lens which has been corrected for colour is still imperfect. If rays\r\npass through all parts of it, those which strike it near the edge will\r\nbe refracted more than those near the centre, and a blurred focus\r\nresults. This is termed _spherical aberration_. You will be able to\r\nunderstand the reason from Figs. 113 and 114. Two rays, A, are parallel\r\nto the axis and enter the lens near the centre (Fig. 113). These meet in\r\none plane. Two other rays, B, strike the lens very obliquely near the\r\nedge, and on that account are both turned sharply upwards, coming to a\r\nfocus in a plane nearer the lens than A. If this happened in a camera\r\nthe results would be very bad. Either A or B would be out of focus. The\r\ntrouble is minimized by placing in front of the lens a plate with a\r\ncentral circular opening in it (denoted by the thick, dark line in Fig.\r\n114). The rays B of Fig. 113 are stopped by this plate, which is\r\ntherefore called a _stop_. But other rays from the same point pass\r\nthrough the hole. These, however, strike the lens much more squarely\r\nabove the centre, and are not unduly refracted, so that they are brought\r\nto a focus in the same plane as rays A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTORTION OF IMAGE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Section of a rectilinear lens.]\r\n\r\nThe lens we have been considering is a single meniscus, such as is used\r\nin landscape photography, mounted with the convex side turned towards\r\nthe inside of the camera, and having the stop in front of it. If you\r\npossess a lens of this sort, try the following experiment with it. Draw\r\na large square on a sheet of white paper and focus it on the screen. The\r\nsides instead of being straight bow outwards: this is called _barrel_\r\ndistortion. Now turn the lens mount round so that the lens is outwards\r\nand the stop inwards. The sides of the square will appear to bow towards\r\nthe centre: this is _pin-cushion_ distortion. For a long time opticians\r\nwere unable to find a remedy. Then Mr. George S. Cundell suggested that\r\n_two_ meniscus lenses should be used in combination, one on either side\r\nof the stop, as in Fig 115. Each produces distortion, but it is\r\ncounteracted by the opposite distortion of the other, and a square is\r\nrepresented as a square. Lenses of this kind are called _rectilinear_,\r\nor straight-line producing.\r\n\r\nWe have now reviewed the three chief defects of a lens--chromatic\r\naberration, spherical aberration, and distortion--and have seen how they\r\nmay be remedied. So we will now pass on to the most perfect of cameras,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMAN EYE.\r\n\r\nThe eye (Fig. 116) is nearly spherical in form, and is surrounded\r\noutside, except in front, by a hard, horny coat called the _sclerotica_\r\n(S). In front is the _cornea_ (A), which bulges outwards, and acts as a\r\ntransparent window to admit light to the lens of the eye (C). Inside the\r\nsclerotica, and next to it, comes the _choroid_ coat; and inside that\r\nagain is the _retina_, or curved focussing screen of the eye, which may\r\nbest be described as a network of fibres ramifying from the optic nerve,\r\nwhich carries sight sensations to the brain. The hollow of the ball is\r\nfull of a jelly-like substance called the _vitreous humour_; and the\r\ncavity between the lens and the cornea is full of water.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, in focussing, the distance between lens and\r\nimage depends on the distance between object and lens. Now, the retina\r\ncannot be pushed nearer to or pulled further away from its lens, like\r\nthe focussing screen of a camera. How, then, is the eye able to focus\r\nsharply objects at distances varying from a foot to many miles?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Section of the human eye.]\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to the answer we must observe that the more convex a\r\nlens is, the shorter is its focus. We will suppose that we have a box\r\ncamera with a lens of six-inch focus fixed rigidly in the position\r\nnecessary for obtaining a sharp image of distant objects. It so happens\r\nthat we want to take with it a portrait of a person only a few feet from\r\nthe lens. If it were a bellows camera, we should rack out the back or\r\nfront. But we cannot do this here. So we place in front of our lens a\r\nsecond convex lens which shortens its principal focus; so that _in\r\neffect_ the box has been racked out sufficiently.\r\n\r\nNature, however, employs a much more perfect method than this. The eye\r\nlens is plastic, like a piece of india-rubber. Its edges are attached to\r\nligaments (L L), which pull outwards and tend to flatten the curve of\r\nits surfaces. The normal focus is for distant objects. When we read a\r\nbook the eye adapts itself to the work. The ligaments relax and the lens\r\ndecreases in diameter while thickening at the centre, until its\r\ncurvature is such as to focus all rays from the book sharply on the\r\nretina. If we suddenly look through the window at something outside, the\r\nligaments pull on the lens envelope and flatten the curves.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful lens is achromatic, and free from spherical aberration\r\nand distortion of image. Nor must we forget that it is aided by an\r\nautomatic \"stop,\" the _iris_, the central hole of which is named the\r\n_pupil_. We say that a person has black, blue, or gray eyes according to\r\nthe colour of the iris. Like the lens, the iris adapts itself to all\r\nconditions, contracting when the light is strong, and opening when the\r\nlight is weak, so that as uniform an amount of light as conditions allow\r\nmay be admitted to the eye. Most modern camera lenses are fitted with\r\nadjustable stops which can be made larger or smaller by twisting a ring\r\non the mount, and are named \"iris\" stops. The image of anything seen is\r\nthrown on the retina upside down, and the brain reverses the position\r\nagain, so that we get a correct impression of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF SPECTACLES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117_b_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118_b_.]\r\n\r\nThe reader will now be able to understand without much trouble the\r\nfunction of a pair of spectacles. A great many people of all ages suffer\r\nfrom short-sight. For one reason or another the distance between lens\r\nand retina becomes too great for a person to distinguish distant objects\r\nclearly. The lens, as shown in Fig 117_a_, is too convex--has its\r\nminimum focus too short--and the rays meet and cross before they reach\r\nthe retina, causing general confusion of outline. This defect is simply\r\nremedied by placing in front of the eye (Fig. 117_b_) a _concave_ lens,\r\nto disperse the rays somewhat before they enter the eye, so that they\r\ncome to a focus on the retina. If a person's sight is thus corrected for\r\ndistant objects, he can still see near objects quite plainly, as the\r\nlens will accommodate its convexity for them. The scientific term for\r\nshort-sight is _myopia_. Long-sight, or _hypermetropia_, signifies that\r\nthe eyeball is too short or the lens too flat. Fig. 118_a_ represents\r\nthe normal condition of a long-sighted eye. When looking at a distant\r\nobject the eye thickens slightly and brings the focus forward into the\r\nretina. But its thickening power in such an eye is very limited, and\r\nconsequently the rays from a near object focus behind the retina. It is\r\ntherefore necessary for a long-sighted person to use _convex_ spectacles\r\nfor reading the newspaper. As seen in Fig. 118_b_, the spectacle lens\r\nconcentrates the rays before they enter the eye, and so does part of the\r\neye's work for it.\r\n\r\nReturning for a moment to the diagram of the eye (Fig. 116), we notice a\r\nblack patch on the retina near the optic nerve. This is the \"yellow\r\nspot.\" Vision is most distinct when the image of the object looked at is\r\nformed on this part of the retina. The \"blind spot\" is that point at\r\nwhich the optic nerve enters the retina, being so called from the fact\r\nthat it is quite insensitive to light. The finding of the blind spot is\r\nan interesting little experiment. On a card make a large and a small\r\nspot three inches apart, the one an eighth, the other half an inch in\r\ndiameter. Bring the card near the face so that an eye is exactly\r\nopposite to each spot, and close the eye opposite to the smaller. Now\r\ndirect the other eye to this spot and you will find, if the card be\r\nmoved backwards and forwards, that at a certain distance the large spot,\r\nthough many times larger than its fellow, has completely vanished,\r\nbecause the rays from it enter the open eye obliquely and fall on the\r\n\"blind spot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE, THE TELESCOPE, AND THE MAGIC-LANTERN.\r\n\r\n     The simple microscope--Use of the simple microscope in the\r\n     telescope--The terrestrial telescope--The Galilean telescope--The\r\n     prismatic telescope--The reflecting telescope--The parabolic\r\n     mirror--The compound microscope--The magic-lantern--The\r\n     bioscope--The plane mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 119 is represented an eye looking at a vase, three inches high,\r\nsituated at A, a foot away. If we were to place another vase, B, six\r\ninches high, at a distance of two feet; or C, nine inches high, at three\r\nfeet; or D, a foot high, at four feet, the image on the retina would in\r\nevery case be of the same size as that cast by A. We can therefore lay\r\ndown the rule that _the apparent size of an object depends on the angle\r\nthat it subtends at the eye_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.]\r\n\r\nTo see a thing more plainly, we go nearer to it; and if it be very\r\nsmall, we hold it close to the eye. There is, however, a limit to the\r\nnearness to which it can be brought with advantage. The normal eye is\r\nunable to adapt its focus to an object less than about ten inches away,\r\ntermed the \"least distance of distinct vision.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIMPLE MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.]\r\n\r\nA magnifying glass comes in useful when we want to examine an object\r\nvery closely. The glass is a lens of short focus, held at a distance\r\nsomewhat less than its principal focal length, F (see Fig. 120), from\r\nthe object. The rays from the head and tip of the pin which enter the\r\neye are denoted by continuous lines. As they are deflected by the glass\r\nthe eye gets the _impression_ that a much longer pin is situated a\r\nconsiderable distance behind the real object in the plane in which the\r\nrefracted rays would meet if produced backwards (shown by the dotted\r\nlines). The effect of the glass, practically, is to remove it (the\r\nobject) to beyond the least distance of distinct vision, and at the same\r\ntime to retain undiminished the angle it subtends at the eye, or, what\r\namounts to the same thing, the actual size of the image formed on the\r\nretina.[22] It follows, therefore, that if a lens be of such short focus\r\nthat it allows us to see an object clearly at a distance of two\r\ninches--that is, one-fifth of the least distance of distinct vision--we\r\nshall get an image on the retina five times larger in diameter than\r\nwould be possible without the lens.\r\n\r\nThe two simple diagrams (Figs. 121 and 122) show why the image to be\r\nmagnified should be nearer to the lens than the principal focus, F. We\r\nhave already seen (Fig. 109) that rays coming from a point in the\r\nprincipal focal plane emerge as a parallel pencil. These the eye can\r\nbring to a focus, because it normally has a curvature for focussing\r\nparallel rays. But, owing to the power of \"accommodation,\" it can also\r\nfocus _diverging_ rays (Fig. 121), the eye lens thickening the necessary\r\namount, and we therefore put our magnifying glass a bit nearer than F to\r\nget full advantage of proximity. If we had the object _outside_ the\r\nprincipal focus, as in Fig. 122, the rays from it would converge, and\r\nthese could not be gathered to a sharp point by the eye lens, as it\r\ncannot _flatten_ more than is required for focussing parallel rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE SIMPLE MICROSCOPE IN THE TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to Fig. 123. At A is a distant object, say, a hundred\r\nyards away. B is a double convex lens, which has a focal length of\r\ntwenty inches. We may suppose that it is a lens in a camera. An inverted\r\nimage of the object is cast by the lens at C. If the eye were placed at\r\nC, it would distinguish nothing. But if withdrawn to D, the least\r\ndistance of distinct vision,[23] behind C, the image is seen clearly.\r\nThat the image really is at C is proved by letting down the focussing\r\nscreen, which at once catches it. Now, as the focus of the lens is twice\r\n_d_, the image will be twice as large as the object would appear if\r\nviewed directly without the lens. We may put this into a very simple\r\nformula:--\r\n\r\n  Magnification = focal length of lens\r\n                  --------------------\r\n                      _d_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 124 we have interposed between the eye and the object a small\r\nmagnifying glass of 2-1/2-inch focus, so that the eye can now clearly\r\nsee the image when one-quarter _d_ away from it. B already magnifies the\r\nimage twice; the eye-piece again magnifies it four times; so that the\r\ntotal magnification is 2 × 4 = 8 times. This result is arrived at\r\nquickly by dividing the focus of B (which corresponds to the\r\nobject-glass of a telescope) by the focus of the eye-piece, thus:--\r\n\r\n    20\r\n   ____ = 8\r\n  2-1/2\r\n\r\nThe ordinary astronomical telescope has a very long focus object-glass\r\nat one end of the tube, and a very short focus eye-piece at the other.\r\nTo see an object clearly one merely has to push in or pull out the\r\neye-piece until its focus exactly corresponds with that of the\r\nobject-glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERRESTRIAL TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nAn astronomical telescope inverts images. This inversion is inconvenient\r\nfor other purposes. So the terrestrial telescope (such as is commonly\r\nused by sailors) has an eye-piece compounded of four convex lenses which\r\nerect as well as magnify the image. Fig. 125 shows the simplest form of\r\ncompound erecting eye-piece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GALILEAN TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.]\r\n\r\nA third form of telescope is that invented by the great Italian\r\nastronomer, Galileo,[24] in 1609. Its principle is shown in Fig. 126.\r\nThe rays transmitted by the object-glass are caught, _before_ coming to\r\na focus, on a concave lens which separates them so that they appear to\r\nmeet in the paths of convergence denoted by the dotted lines. The image\r\nis erect. Opera-glasses are constructed on the Galilean principle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISMATIC TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to use a long-focus object-glass without a long\r\nfocussing-tube, a system of glass reflecting prisms is sometimes\r\nemployed, as in Fig. 127. A ray passing through the object-glass is\r\nreflected from one posterior surface of prism A on to the other\r\nposterior surface, and by it out through the front on to a second prism\r\narranged at right angles to it, which passes the ray on to the compound\r\neye-piece. The distance between object-glass and eye-piece is thus\r\npractically trebled. The best-known prismatic telescopes are the Zeiss\r\nfield-glasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REFLECTING TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit reference to the _reflecting_ telescope, so largely\r\nused by astronomers. The front end of the telescope is open, there being\r\nno object-glass. Rays from the object fall on a parabolic mirror\r\nsituated in the rear end of the tube. This reflects them forwards to a\r\nfocus. In the Newtonian reflector a plane mirror or prism is situated in\r\nthe axis of the tube, at the focus, to reflect the rays through an\r\neye-piece projecting through the side of the tube. Herschel's form of\r\nreflector has the mirror set at an angle to the axis, so that the rays\r\nare reflected direct into an eye-piece pointing through the side of the\r\ntube towards the mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARABOLIC MIRROR.\r\n\r\nThis mirror (Fig. 128) is of such a shape that all rays parallel to the\r\naxis are reflected to a common point. In the marine searchlight a\r\npowerful arc lamp is arranged with the arc at the focus of a parabolic\r\nreflector, which sends all reflected light forward in a pencil of\r\nparallel rays. The most powerful searchlight in existence gives a light\r\nequal to that of 350 million candles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--A parabolic reflector.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOUND MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed (Fig. 110) that the nearer an object\r\napproaches a lens the further off behind it is the real image formed,\r\nuntil the object has reached the focal distance, when no image at all is\r\ncast, as it is an infinite distance behind the lens. We will assume that\r\na certain lens has a focus of six inches. We place a lighted candle four\r\nfeet in front of it, and find that a _sharp_ diminished image is cast on\r\na ground-glass screen held seven inches behind it. If we now exchange\r\nthe positions of the candle and the screen, we shall get an enlarged\r\nimage of the candle. This is a simple demonstration of the law of\r\n_conjugate foci_--namely, that the distance between the lens and an\r\nobject on one side and that between the lens and the corresponding image\r\non the other bear a definite relation to each other; and an object\r\nplaced at either focus will cast an image at the other. Whether the\r\nimage is larger or smaller than the object depends on which focus it\r\noccupies. In the case of the object-glass of a telescope the image was\r\nat what we may call the _short_ focus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Diagram to explain the compound microscope.]\r\n\r\nNow, a compound microscope is practically a telescope with the object at\r\nthe _long_ focus, very close to a short-focus lens. A greatly enlarged\r\nimage is thrown (see Fig. 129) at the conjugate focus, and this is\r\ncaught and still further magnified by the eye-piece. We may add that the\r\nobject-glass, or _objective_, of a microscope is usually compounded of\r\nseveral lenses, as is also the eye-piece.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC-LANTERN.\r\n\r\nThe most essential features of a magic-lantern are:--(1) The _source of\r\nlight_; (2) the _condenser_ for concentrating the light rays on to the\r\nslide; (3) the _lens_ for projecting a magnified image on to a screen.\r\n\r\nFig. 130 shows these diagrammatically. The _illuminant_ is most commonly\r\nan oil-lamp, or an acetylene gas jet, or a cylinder of lime heated to\r\nintense luminosity by an oxy-hydrogen flame. The natural combustion of\r\nhydrogen is attended by a great heat, and when the supply of oxygen is\r\nartificially increased the temperature of the flame rises enormously.\r\nThe nozzle of an oxy-hydrogen jet has an interior pipe connected with\r\nthe cylinder holding one gas, and an exterior, and somewhat larger, pipe\r\nleading from that containing the other, the two being arranged\r\nconcentrically at the nozzle. By means of valves the proportions of the\r\ngases can be regulated to give the best results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--Sketch of the elements of a magic-lantern.]\r\n\r\nThe _condenser_ is set somewhat further from the illuminant than the\r\nprincipal focal length of the lenses, so that the rays falling on them\r\nare bent inwards, or to the slide.\r\n\r\nThe _objective_, or object lens, stands in front of the slide. Its\r\nposition is adjustable by means of a rack and a draw-tube. The nearer it\r\nis brought to the slide the further away is the conjugate focus (see p.\r\n239), and consequently the image. The exhibitor first sets up his screen\r\nand lantern, and then finds the conjugate foci of slide and image by\r\nracking the lens in or out.\r\n\r\nIf a very short focus objective be used, subjects of microscopic\r\nproportions can be projected on the screen enormously magnified. During\r\nthe siege of Paris in 1870-71 the Parisians established a balloon and\r\npigeon post to carry letters which had been copied in a minute size by\r\nphotography. These copies could be enclosed in a quill and attached to a\r\npigeon's wing. On receipt, the copies were placed in a special lantern\r\nand thrown as large writing on the screen. Micro-photography has since\r\nthen made great strides, and is now widely used for scientific purposes,\r\none of the most important being the study of the crystalline formations\r\nof metals under different conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n\"Living pictures\" are the most recent improvement in magic-lantern\r\nentertainments. The negatives from which the lantern films are printed\r\nare made by passing a ribbon of sensitized celluloid through a special\r\nform of camera, which feeds the ribbon past the lens in a series of\r\njerks, an exposure being made automatically by a revolving shutter\r\nduring each rest. The positive film is placed in a lantern, and the\r\nintermittent movement is repeated; but now the source of illumination is\r\nbehind the film, and light passes outwards through the shutter to the\r\nscreen. In the Urban bioscope the film travels at the rate of fifteen\r\nmiles an hour, upwards of one hundred exposures being made every second.\r\n\r\nThe impression of continuous movement arises from the fact that the eye\r\ncannot get rid of a visual impression in less than one-tenth of a\r\nsecond. So that if a series of impressions follow one another more\r\nrapidly than the eye can rid itself of them the impressions will\r\noverlap, and give one of _motion_, if the position of some of the\r\nobjects, or parts of the objects, varies slightly in each succeeding\r\npicture.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANE MIRROR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.]\r\n\r\nThis chapter may conclude with a glance at the common looking-glass. Why\r\ndo we see a reflection in it? The answer is given graphically by Fig.\r\n131. Two rays, A _b_, A _c_, from a point A strike the mirror M at the\r\npoints _b_ and _c_. Lines _b_ N, _c_ O, drawn from these points\r\nperpendicular to the mirror are called their _normals_. The angles A\r\n_b_ N, A _c_ O are the _angles of incidence_ of rays A _b_, A _c_. The\r\npaths which the rays take after reflection must make angles with _b_ N\r\nand _c_ O respectively equal to A _b_ N, A _c_ O. These are the _angles\r\nof reflection_. If the eye is so situated that the rays enter it as in\r\nour illustration, an image of the point A is seen at the point A^1, in\r\nwhich the lines D _b_, E _c_ meet when produced backwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.]\r\n\r\nWhen the vertical mirror is replaced by a horizontal reflecting surface,\r\nsuch as a pond (Fig. 132), the same thing happens. The point at which\r\nthe ray from the reflection of the spire's tip to the eye appears to\r\npass through the surface of the water must be so situated that if a line\r\nwere drawn perpendicular to it from the surface the angles made by lines\r\ndrawn from the real spire tip and from the observer's eye to the base of\r\nthe perpendicular would be equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[22] Glazebrook, \"Light,\" p. 157.\r\n\r\n[23] Glazebrook, \"Light,\" p. 157.\r\n\r\n[24] Galileo was severely censured and imprisoned for daring to maintain\r\nthat the earth moved round the sun, and revolved on its axis.\r\n\r\n[25] For a full account of Animated Pictures the reader might\r\nadvantageously consult \"The Romance of Modern Invention,\" pp. 166 foll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\nSOUND AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n     Nature of sound--The ear--Musical instruments--The vibration of\r\n     strings--The sounding-board and the frame of a piano--The\r\n     strings--The striking mechanism--The quality of a note.\r\n\r\n\r\nSound differs from light, heat, and electricity in that it can be\r\npropagated through matter only. Sound-waves are matter-waves, not\r\nether-waves. This can be proved by placing an electric bell under the\r\nbell-glass of an air-pump and exhausting all the air. Ether still\r\nremains inside the glass, but if the bell be set in motion no sound is\r\naudible. Admit air, and the clang of the gong is heard quite plainly.\r\n\r\nSound resembles light and heat, however, thus far, that it can be\r\nconcentrated by means of suitable lenses and curved surfaces. An _echo_\r\nis a proof of its _reflection_ from a surface.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the various appliances used for producing\r\nsound-waves of a definite character, let us examine that wonderful\r\nnatural apparatus\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EAR,\r\n\r\nthrough which we receive those sensations which we call sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--Diagrammatic sketch of the parts of the ear.]\r\n\r\nFig. 133 is a purely diagrammatic section of the ear, showing the\r\nvarious parts distorted and out of proportion. Beginning at the left, we\r\nhave the _outer ear_, the lobe, to gather in the sound-waves on to the\r\nmembrane of the tympanum, or drum, to which is attached the first of a\r\nseries of _ossicles_, or small bones. The last of these presses against\r\nan opening in the _inner ear_, a cavity surrounded by the bones of the\r\nhead. Inside the inner ear is a watery fluid, P, called _perilymph_\r\n(\"surrounding water\"), immersed in which is a membranic envelope, M,\r\ncontaining _endolymph_ (\"inside water\"), also full of fluid. Into this\r\nfluid project E E E, the terminations of the _auditory nerve_, leading\r\nto the brain.\r\n\r\nWhen sound-waves strike the tympanum, they cause it to move inwards and\r\noutwards in a series of rapid movements. The ossicles operated by the\r\ntympanum press on the little opening O, covered by a membrane, and every\r\ntime they push it in they slightly squeeze the perilymph, which in turn\r\ncompresses the endolymph, which affects the nerve-ends, and telegraphs a\r\nsensation of sound to the brain.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 134 we have a more developed sketch, giving in fuller detail,\r\nthough still not in their actual proportions, the components of the ear.\r\nThe ossicles M, I, and S are respectively the _malleus_ (hammer),\r\n_incus_ (anvil), and _stapes_ (stirrup). Each is attached by ligaments\r\nto the walls of the middle ear. The tympanum moves the malleus, the\r\nmalleus the incus, and the incus the stapes, the last pressing into the\r\nopening O of Fig. 133, which is scientifically known as the _fenestra\r\novalis_, or oval window. As liquids are practically incompressible,\r\nnature has made allowance for the squeezing in of the oval window\r\nmembrane, by providing a second opening, the round window, also covered\r\nwith a membrane. When the stapes pushes the oval membrane in, the round\r\nmembrane bulges out, its elasticity sufficing to put a certain pressure\r\non the perilymph (indicated by the dotted portion of the inner ear).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--Diagrammatic section of the ear, showing the\r\nvarious parts.]\r\n\r\nThe inner ear consists of two main parts, the _cochlea_--so called from\r\nits resemblance in shape to a snail's shell--and the _semicircular\r\ncanals_. Each portion has its perilymph and endolymph, and contains a\r\nnumber of the nerve-ends, which are, however, most numerous in the\r\ncochlea. We do not know for certain what the functions of the canals and\r\nthe cochlea are; but it is probable that the former enables us to\r\ndistinguish between the _intensity_ or loudness of sounds and the\r\ndirection from which they come, while the latter enables us to determine\r\nthe _pitch_ of a note. In the cochlea are about 2,800 tiny nerve-ends,\r\ncalled the _rods of Corti_. The normal ear has such a range as to give\r\nabout 33 rods to the semitone. The great scientist Helmholtz has\r\nadvanced the theory that these little rods are like tiny tuning-forks,\r\neach responding to a note of a certain pitch; so that when a string of a\r\npiano is sounded and the air vibrations are transmitted to the inner\r\near, they affect only one of these rods and the part of the brain which\r\nit serves, and we have the impression of one particular note. It has\r\nbeen proved by experiment that a very sensitive ear can distinguish\r\nbetween sounds varying in pitch by only 1/64th of a semitone, or but\r\nhalf the range of any one Corti fibre. This difficulty Helmholtz gets\r\nover by suggesting that in such an ear two adjacent fibres are affected,\r\nbut one more than the other.\r\n\r\nA person who has a \"good ear\" for music is presumably one whose Corti\r\nrods are very perfect. Unlucky people like the gentleman who could only\r\nrecognize one tune, and that because people took off their hats when it\r\ncommenced, are physically deficient. Their Corti rods cannot be properly\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nWhat applies to one single note applies also to the elements of a\r\nmusical chord. A dozen notes may sound simultaneously, but the ear is\r\nable to assimilate each and blend it with its fellows; yet it requires a\r\nvery sensitive and well-trained ear to pick out any one part of a\r\nharmony and concentrate the brain's attention on that part.\r\n\r\nThe ear has a much larger range than the eye. \"While the former ranges\r\nover eleven octaves, but little more than a single octave is possible to\r\nthe latter. The quickest vibrations which strike the eye, as light, have\r\nonly about twice the rapidity of the slowest; whereas the quickest\r\nvibrations which strike the ear, as a musical sound, have more than two\r\nthousand times the rapidity of the slowest.\"[26] To come to actual\r\nfigures, the ordinary ear is sensitive to vibrations ranging from 16 to\r\n38,000 per second. The bottom and top notes of a piano make respectively\r\nabout 40 and 4,000 vibrations a second. Of course, some ears, like some\r\neyes, cannot comprehend the whole scale. The squeak of bats and the\r\nchirrup of crickets are inaudible to some people; and dogs are able to\r\nhear sounds far too shrill to affect the human auditory apparatus.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting part of this wonderful organ is the tympanic\r\nmembrane, which is provided with muscles for altering its tension\r\nautomatically. If we are \"straining our ears\" to catch a shrill sound,\r\nwe tighten the membrane; while if we are \"getting ready\" for a deep,\r\nloud report like that of a gun, we allow the drum to slacken.\r\n\r\nThe _Eustachian tube_ (Fig. 134) communicates with the mouth. Its\r\nfunction is probably to keep the air-pressure equal on both sides of the\r\ndrum. When one catches cold the tube is apt to become blocked by mucus,\r\ncausing unequal pressure and consequent partial deafness.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, it will be well to remind our more youthful\r\nreaders that the ear is delicately as well as wonderfully made, and must\r\nbe treated with respect. Sudden shouting into the ear, or a playful\r\nblow, may have most serious effects, by bursting the tympanum or\r\ninjuring the arrangement of the tiny bones putting it in communication\r\nwith the inner ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nThese are contrivances for producing sonorous shocks following each\r\nother rapidly at regular intervals. Musical sounds are distinguished\r\nfrom mere noises by their regularity. If we shake a number of nails in a\r\ntin box, we get only a series of superimposed and chaotic sensations. On\r\nthe other hand, if we strike a tuning-fork, the air is agitated a\r\ncertain number of times a second, with a pleasant result which we call a\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nWe will begin our excursion into the region of musical instruments with\r\nan examination of that very familiar piece of furniture,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIANOFORTE,\r\n\r\nwhich means literally the \"soft-strong.\" By many children the piano is\r\nregarded as a great nuisance, the swallower-up of time which could be\r\nmuch more agreeably occupied, and is accordingly shown much less respect\r\nthan is given to a phonograph or a musical-box. Yet the modern piano is\r\na very clever piece of work, admirably adapted for the production of\r\nsweet melody--if properly handled. The two forms of piano now generally\r\nused are the _upright_, with vertical sound-board and wires, and the\r\n_grand_, with horizontal sound-board.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIBRATION OF STRINGS.\r\n\r\nAs the pianoforte is a stringed instrument, some attention should be\r\ngiven to the subject of the vibration of strings. A string in a state of\r\ntension emits a note when plucked and allowed to vibrate freely. The\r\n_pitch_ of the note depends on several conditions:--(1) The diameter of\r\nthe string; (2) the tension of the string; (3) the length of the string;\r\n(4) the substance of the string. Taking them in order:--(1.) The number\r\nof vibrations per second is inversely proportional to the diameter of\r\nthe string: thus, a string one-quarter of an inch in diameter would\r\nvibrate only half as often in a given time as a string one-eighth of an\r\ninch in diameter. (2.) The length remaining the same, the number of\r\nvibrations is directly proportional to the _square root_ of the\r\n_tension_: thus, a string strained by a 16-lb. weight would vibrate four\r\ntimes as fast as it would if strained by a 1-lb. weight. (3.) The number\r\nof vibrations is inversely proportional to the _length_ of the string:\r\nthus, a one-foot string would vibrate twice as fast as a two-foot\r\nstring, strained to the same tension, and of equal diameter and weight.\r\n(4.) Other things being equal, the rate of vibration is inversely\r\nproportional to the square root of the _density_ of the substance: so\r\nthat a steel wire would vibrate more rapidly than a platinum wire of\r\nequal diameter, length, and tension. These facts are important to\r\nremember as the underlying principles of stringed instruments.\r\n\r\nNow, if you hang a wire from a cord, and hang a heavy weight from the\r\nwire, the wire will be in a state of high tension, and yield a distinct\r\nnote if struck. But the volume of sound will be very small, much too\r\nsmall for a practical instrument. The surface of the string itself is so\r\nlimited that it sets up but feeble motions in the surrounding air. Now\r\nhang the wire from a large board and strike it again. The volume of\r\nsound has greatly increased, because the string has transmitted its\r\nvibrations to the large surface of the board.\r\n\r\nTo get the full sound-value of the vibrations of a string, we evidently\r\nought to so mount the string that it may influence a large sounding\r\nsurface. In a violin this is effected by straining the strings over a\r\n\"bridge\" resting on a hollow box made of perfectly elastic wood. Draw\r\nthe bow across a string. The loud sound heard proceeds not from the\r\nstring only, but also from the whole surface of the box.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUNDING-BOARD AND FRAME OF A PIANO.\r\n\r\nA piano has its strings strained across a _frame_ of wood or steel, from\r\na row of hooks in the top of the frame to a row of tapering square-ended\r\npins in the bottom, the wires passing over sharp edges near both ends.\r\nThe tuner is able, on turning a pin, to tension its strings till it\r\ngives any desired note. Readers may be interested to learn that the\r\naverage tension of a string is 275 lbs., so that the total strain on the\r\nframe of a grand piano is anything between 20 and 30 _tons_.\r\n\r\nTo the back of the frame is attached the _sounding-board_, made of\r\nspruce fir (the familiar Christmas tree). This is obtained from Central\r\nand Eastern Europe, where it is carefully selected and prepared, as it\r\nis essential that the timber should be sawn in such a way that the grain\r\nof the wood runs in the proper direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRINGS.\r\n\r\nThese are made of extremely strong steel wire of the best quality. If\r\nyou examine the wires of your piano, you will see that they vary in\r\nthickness, the thinnest being at the treble end of the frame. It is\r\nfound impracticable to use wires of the same gauge and the same tension\r\nthroughout. The makers therefore use highly-tensioned thick wires for\r\nthe bass, and finer, shorter wires for the treble, taking advantage of\r\nthe three factors--weight, tension, and length--which we have noticed\r\nabove. The wires for the deepest notes are wrapped round with fine\r\ncopper wire to add to their weight without increasing their diameter at\r\nthe tuning-pins. There are about 600 yards (roughly one-third of a mile)\r\nof wire in a grand piano.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRIKING MECHANISM.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to the apparatus for putting the strings in a state of\r\nvibration. The grand piano mechanism shown in Fig. 135 may be taken as\r\ntypical of the latest improvements. The essentials of an effective\r\nmechanism are:--(1) That the blow delivered shall be sharp and certain;\r\n(2) that the string shall be immediately \"damped,\" or have its vibration\r\nchecked if required, so as not to interfere with the succeeding notes of\r\nother strings; (3) that the hammer shall be able to repeat the blows in\r\nquick succession. The _hammer_ has a head of mahogany covered with\r\nfelt, the thickness of which tapers gradually and regularly from an inch\r\nand a quarter at the bass end to three-sixteenths of an inch at the\r\nextreme treble notes. The entire eighty-five hammers for the piano are\r\ncovered all together in one piece, and then they are cut apart from\r\neach other. The consistency of the covering is very important. If too\r\nhard, it yields a harsh note, and must be reduced to the right degree by\r\npricking with a needle. In the diagram the felt is indicated by the\r\ndotted part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--The striking mechanism of a \"grand\" piano.]\r\n\r\nThe _action carriage_ which operates the hammer is somewhat complicated.\r\nWhen the key is depressed, the left end rises, and pushes up the whole\r\ncarriage, which is pivoted at one end. The hammer shank is raised by the\r\njack B pressing upon a knob, N, called the _notch_, attached to the\r\nunder side of the shank. When the jack has risen to a certain point, its\r\narm, B^1, catches against the button C and jerks it from under the\r\nnotch at the very moment when the hammer strikes, so that it may not be\r\nblocked against the string. As it rebounds, the hammer is caught on the\r\n_repetition lever_ R, which lifts it to allow of perfect repetition.\r\n\r\nThe _check_ catches the tail of the hammer head during its descent when\r\nthe key is raised, and prevents it coming back violently on the carriage\r\nand rest. The tail is curved so as to wedge against the check without\r\njamming in any way. The moment the carriage begins to rise, the rear end\r\nof the key lifts a lever connected with the _damper_ by a vertical\r\nwire, and raises the damper of the string. If the key is held down, the\r\nvibrations continue for a long time after the blow; but if released at\r\nonce, the damper stifles them as the hammer regains its seat. A bar, L,\r\npassing along under all the _damper lifters_, is raised by depressing\r\nthe loud pedal. The _soft pedal_ slides the whole keyboard along such a\r\ndistance that the hammers strike two only out of the three strings\r\nallotted to all except the bass notes, which have only one string\r\napiece, or two, according to their depth or length. In some pianos the\r\nsoft pedal presses a special damper against the strings; and a third\r\nkind of device moves the hammers nearer the strings so that they deliver\r\na lighter blow. These two methods of damping are confined to upright\r\npianos.\r\n\r\nA high-class piano is the result of very careful workmanship. The\r\nmechanism of each note must be accurately regulated by its tiny screws\r\nto a minute fraction of an inch. It must be ensured that every hammer\r\nstrikes its blow at exactly the right place on the string, since on this\r\ndepends the musical value of the note. The adjustment of the dampers\r\nrequires equal care, and the whole work calls for a sensitive ear\r\ncombined with skilled mechanical knowledge, so that the instrument may\r\nhave a light touch, strength, and certainty of action throughout the\r\nwhole keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF A NOTE.\r\n\r\nIf two strings, alike in all respects and equally tensioned, are\r\nplucked, both will give the same note, but both will not necessarily\r\nhave the same quality of tone. The quality, or _timbre_, as musicians\r\ncall it, is influenced by the presence of _overtones_, or _harmonics_,\r\nin combination with the _fundamental_, or deepest, tone of the string.\r\nThe fact is, that while a vibrating string vibrates as a whole, it also\r\nvibrates in parts. There are, as it were, small waves superimposed on\r\nthe big fundamental waves. Points of least motion, called _nodes_, form\r\non the string, dividing it into two, three, four, five, etc., parts,\r\nwhich may be further divided by subsidiary nodes. The string, considered\r\nas halved by one node, gives the first overtone, or octave of the\r\nfundamental. It may also vibrate as three parts, and give the second\r\novertone, or twelfth of the fundamental;[28] and as four parts, and give\r\nthe third overtone, the double octave.\r\n\r\nNow, if a string be struck at a point corresponding to a node, the\r\novertones which require that point for a node will be killed, on account\r\nof the excessive motion imparted to the string at that spot. Thus to hit\r\nit at the middle kills the octave, the double octave, etc.; while to hit\r\nit at a point one-third of the length from one end stifles the twelfth\r\nand all its sub-multiples.\r\n\r\nA fundamental note robbed of all its harmonics is hard to obtain, which\r\nis not a matter for regret, as it is a most uninteresting sound. To get\r\na rich tone we must keep as many useful harmonics as possible, and\r\ntherefore a piano hammer is so placed as to strike the string at a point\r\nwhich does not interfere with the best harmonics, but kills those which\r\nare objectionable. Pianoforte makers have discovered by experiment that\r\nthe most pleasing tone is excited when the point against which the\r\nhammer strikes is one-seventh to one-ninth of the length of the wire\r\nfrom one end.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the material which does the actual striking is also of\r\nimportance. The harder the substance, and the sharper the blow, the more\r\nprominent do the harmonics become; so that the worker has to regulate\r\ncarefully both the duration of the blow and the hardness of the hammer\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] Tyndall, \"On Sound,\" p. 75.\r\n\r\n[27] A Broadwood \"grand\" is made up of 10,700 separate pieces, and in\r\nits manufacture forty separate trades are concerned.\r\n\r\n[28] Twelve notes higher up the scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\n\r\nWIND INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n     Longitudinal vibration--Columns of air--Resonance of columns of\r\n     air--Length and tone--The open pipe--The overtones of an open\r\n     pipe--Where overtones are used--The arrangement of the pipes and\r\n     pedals--Separate sound-boards--Varieties of stops--Tuning pipes and\r\n     reeds--The bellows--Electric and pneumatic actions--The largest\r\n     organ in the world--Human reeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL VIBRATION.\r\n\r\nIn stringed instruments we are concerned only with the transverse\r\nvibrations of a string--that is, its movements in a direction at right\r\nangles to the axis of the string. A string can also vibrate\r\nlongitudinally--that is, in the direction of its axis--as may be proved\r\nby drawing a piece of resined leather along a violin string. In this\r\ncase the harmonics \"step up\" at the same rate as when the movements were\r\ntransverse.\r\n\r\nLet us substitute for a wire a stout bar of metal fixed at one end only.\r\nThe longitudinal vibrations of this rod contain overtones of a different\r\nratio. The first harmonic is not an octave, but a twelfth. While a\r\ntensioned string is divided by nodes into two, three, four, five, six,\r\netc., parts, a rod fixed at one end only is capable of producing only\r\nthose harmonics which correspond to division into three, five, seven,\r\nnine, etc., parts. Therefore a free-end rod and a wire of the same\r\nfundamental note would not have the same _timbre_, or quality, owing to\r\nthe difference in the harmonics.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMNS OF AIR.\r\n\r\nIn wind instruments we employ, instead of rods or wires, columns of air\r\nas the vibrating medium. The note of the column depends on its length.\r\nIn the \"penny whistle,\" flute, clarionet, and piccolo the length of the\r\ncolumn is altered by closing or opening apertures in the substance\r\nencircling the column.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESONANCE OF COLUMNS OF AIR.\r\n\r\nWhy does a tube closed at one end, such as the shank of a key, emit a\r\nnote when we blow across the open end? The act of blowing drives a thin\r\nsheet of air against the edge of the tube and causes it to vibrate. The\r\nvibrations are confused, some \"pulses\" occurring more frequently than\r\nothers. If we blew against the edge of a knife or a piece of wood, we\r\nshould hear nothing but a hiss. But when, as in the case which we are\r\nconsidering, there is a partly-enclosed column of air close to the\r\npulses, this selects those pulses which correspond to its natural period\r\nof vibration, and augments them to a sustained and very audible musical\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 136.--Showing how the harmonics of a \"stopped\" pipe\r\nare formed.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 136, _1_ is a pipe, closed at the bottom and open at the top. A\r\ntuning-fork of the same note as the pipe is struck and held over it so\r\nthat the prongs vibrate upwards and downwards. At the commencement of an\r\noutward movement of the prongs the air in front of them is _compressed_.\r\nThis impulse, imparted to the air in the pipe, runs down the column,\r\nstrikes the bottom, and returns. Just as it reaches the top the prong is\r\nbeginning to move inwards, causing a _rarefaction_ of the air behind\r\nit. This effect also travels down and back up the column of air in the\r\npipe, reaching the prong just as it arrives at the furthest point of the\r\ninward motion. The process is repeated, and the column of air in the\r\npipe, striking on the surrounding atmosphere at regular intervals,\r\ngreatly increases the volume of sound. We must observe that if the\r\ntuning-fork were of too high or too low a note for the column of air to\r\nmove in perfect sympathy with it, this increase of sound would not\r\nresult. Now, when we blow across the end, we present, as it were, a\r\nnumber of vibrating tuning-forks to the pipe, which picks out those\r\nair-pulses with which it sympathizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENGTH AND TONE.\r\n\r\nThe rate of vibration is found to be inversely proportional to the\r\nlength of the pipe. Thus, the vibrations of a two-foot pipe are twice as\r\nrapid as those of a four-foot pipe, and the note emitted by the former\r\nis an octave higher than that of the latter. A one-foot pipe gives a\r\nnote an octave higher still. We are here speaking of the _fundamental_\r\ntones of the pipes. With them, as in the case of strings, are associated\r\nthe _overtones_, or harmonics, which can be brought into prominence by\r\nincreasing the pressure of the blast at the top of the pipe. Blow very\r\nhard on your key, and the note suddenly changes to one much shriller. It\r\nis the twelfth of the fundamental, of which it has completely got the\r\nupper hand.\r\n\r\nWe must now put on our thinking-caps and try to understand how this\r\ncomes about. First, let us note that the vibration of a body (in this\r\ncase a column of air) means a motion from a point of rest to a point of\r\nrest, or from node to node. In the air-column in Fig. 136, _1_, there is\r\nonly one point of rest for an impulse--namely, at the bottom of the\r\npipe. So that to pass from node to node the impulse must pass up the\r\npipe and down again. The distance from node to node in a vibrating body\r\nis called a _ventral segment_. Remember this term. Therefore the pipe\r\nrepresents a semi-ventral segment when the fundamental note is sounding.\r\n\r\nWhen the first overtone is sounded the column divides itself into two\r\nvibrating parts. Where will the node between them be? We might naturally\r\nsay, \"Half-way up.\" But this cannot be so; for if the node were so\r\nsituated, an impulse going down the pipe would only have to travel to\r\nthe bottom to find another node, while an impulse going up would have\r\nto travel to the top and back again--that is, go twice as far. So the\r\nnode forms itself _one-third_ of the distance down the pipe. From B to A\r\n(Fig. 136, _2_) and back is now equal to from B to C. When the second\r\novertone is blown (Fig. 136, _3_) a third node forms. The pipe is now\r\ndivided into _five_ semi-ventral segments. And with each succeeding\r\novertone another node and ventral segment are added.\r\n\r\nThe law of vibration of a column of air is that the number of vibrations\r\nis directly proportional to the number of semi-ventral segments into\r\nwhich the column of air inside the pipe is divided.[29] If the\r\nfundamental tone gives 100 vibrations per second, the first overtone in\r\na closed pipe must give 300, and the second 500 vibrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPEN PIPE.\r\n\r\nA pipe open at both ends is capable of emitting a note. But we shall\r\nfind, if we experiment, that the note of a stopped pipe is an octave\r\nlower than that of an open pipe of equal length. This is explained by\r\nFig. 137, _1_. The air-column in the pipe (of the same length as that in\r\nFig. 136) divides itself, when an end is blown across, into two equal\r\nportions at the node B, the natural point to obtain equilibrium. A pulse\r\nwill pass from A or A^1 to B and back again in half the time required\r\nto pass from A to B and back in Fig. 136, _1_; therefore the note is an\r\noctave higher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--Showing how harmonics of an open pipe are\r\nformed, B, B^1, and C are \"nodes.\" The arrows indicate the distance\r\ntravelled by a sound impulse from a node to a node.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OVERTONES OF AN OPEN PIPE.\r\n\r\nThe first overtone results when nodes form as in Fig. 137, _2_, at\r\npoints one-quarter of the length of the pipe from the ends, giving one\r\ncomplete ventral segment and two semi-ventral segments. The vibrations\r\nnow are twice as rapid as before. The second overtone requires three\r\nnodes, as in Fig. 137, _3_. The rate has now trebled. So that, while\r\nthe overtones of a closed pipe rise in the ratio 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.,\r\nthose of an open pipe rise in the proportion 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE OVERTONES ARE USED.\r\n\r\nIn the flute, piccolo, and clarionet, as well as in the horn class of\r\ninstrument, the overtones are as important as the fundamental notes. By\r\nartificially altering the length of the column of air, the fundamental\r\nnotes are also altered, while the harmonics of each fundamental are\r\nproduced at will by varying the blowing pressure; so that a continuous\r\nchromatic, or semitonal, scale is possible throughout the compass of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGAN.\r\n\r\nFrom the theory of acoustics[30] we pass to the practical application,\r\nand concentrate our attention upon the grandest of all wind instruments,\r\nthe pipe organ. This mechanism has a separate pipe for every note,\r\nproperly proportioned. A section of an ordinary wooden pipe is given in\r\nFig. 138. Wind rushes up through the foot of the pipe into a little\r\nchamber, closed by a block of wood or a plate except for a narrow slit,\r\nwhich directs it against the sharp lip A, and causes a fluttering, the\r\nproper pulse of which is converted by the air-column above into a\r\nmusical sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--Section of an ordinary wooden \"flue\" pipe.]\r\n\r\nIn even the smallest organs more than one pipe is actuated by one key on\r\nthe keyboard, for not only do pipes of different shapes give different\r\nqualities of tone, but it is found desirable to have ranks of pipes with\r\ntheir bottom note of different pitches. The length of an open pipe is\r\nmeasured from the edge of the lip to the top of the pipe; of a stopped\r\npipe, from the lip to the top and back again. When we speak of a 16 or 8\r\nfoot rank, or stop, we mean one of which the lowest note in the rank is\r\nthat produced by a 16 or 8 foot open pipe, or their stopped equivalents\r\n(8 or 4 foot). In a big organ we find 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 foot stops,\r\nand some of these repeated a number of times in pipes of different shape\r\nand construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PIPES.\r\n\r\nWe will now study briefly the mechanism of a very simple single-keyboard\r\norgan, with five ranks of pipes, or stops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--The table of a sound-board.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to arrange matters so that the pressing down of one key\r\nmay make all five of the pipes belonging to it speak, or only four,\r\nthree, two, or one, as we may desire. The pipes are mounted in rows on a\r\n_sound-board_, which is built up in several layers. At the top is the\r\n_upper board_; below it come the _sliders_, one for each stop; and\r\nunderneath that the _table_. In Fig. 139 we see part of the table from\r\nbelow. Across the under side are fastened parallel bars with spaces\r\n(shown black) left between them. Two other bars are fastened across the\r\nends, so that each groove is enclosed by wood at the top and on all\r\nsides. The under side of the table has sheets of leather glued or\r\notherwise attached to it in such a manner that no air can leak from one\r\ngroove to the next. Upper board, sliders, and table are pierced with\r\nrows of holes, to permit the passage of wind from the grooves to the\r\npipes. The grooves under the big pipes are wider than those under the\r\nsmall pipes, as they have to pass more air. The bars between the grooves\r\nalso vary in width according to the weight of the pipes which they have\r\nto carry. The sliders can be moved in and out a short distance in the\r\ndirection of the axis of the rows of pipes. There is one slider under\r\neach row. When a slider is in, the holes in it do not correspond with\r\nthose in the table and upper board, so that no wind can get from the\r\ngrooves to the rank over that particular slider. Fig. 140 shows the\r\nmanner in which the sliders are operated by the little knobs (also\r\ncalled stops) projecting from the casing of the organ within convenient\r\nreach of the performer's hands. One stop is in, the other drawn out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 141 we see the table, etc., in cross section, with a slider out,\r\nputting the pipes of its rank in communication with the grooves. The\r\nsame diagram shows us in section the little triangular _pallets_ which\r\nadmit air from the _wind-chest_ to the grooves; and Fig. 142 gives us an\r\nend section of table, sliders, and wind-chest, together with the rods,\r\netc., connecting the key to its pallet. When the key is depressed, the\r\n_sticker_ (a slight wooden rod) is pushed up. This rocks a _backfall_,\r\nor pivoted lever, to which is attached the _pulldown_, a wire\r\npenetrating the bottom of the wind-chest to the pallet. As soon as the\r\npallet opens, wind rushes into the groove above through the aperture in\r\nthe leather bottom, and thence to any one of the pipes of which the\r\nslider has been drawn out. (The sliders in Fig. 142 are solid black.) It\r\nis evident that if the sound-board is sufficiently deep from back to\r\nfront, any number of rows of pipes may be placed on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPEDALS.\r\n\r\nThe organ pedals are connected to the pallets by an action similar to\r\nthat of the keys. The pedal stops are generally of deep tone, 32-foot\r\nand 16-foot, as they have to sustain the bass part of the musical\r\nharmonies. By means of _couplers_ one or more of the keyboard stops may\r\nbe linked to the pedals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATE SOUND-BOARDS.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard of a very large organ has as many as five _manuals_, or\r\nrows of keys. Each manual operates what is practically a separate organ\r\nmounted on its own sound-board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--General section of a two-manual organ.]\r\n\r\nThe manuals are arranged in steps, each slightly overhanging that\r\nbelow. Taken in order from the top, they are:--(1.) _Echo organ_, of\r\nstops of small scale and very soft tone, enclosed in a \"swell-box.\" (2.)\r\n_Solo organ_, of stops imitating orchestral instruments. The wonderful\r\n\"vox humana\" stop also belongs to this manual. (3.) _Swell organ_,\r\ncontained in a swell-box, the front and sides of which have shutters\r\nwhich can be opened and closed by the pressure of the foot on a lever,\r\nso as to regulate the amount of sound proceeding from the pipes inside.\r\n(4.) _Great organ_, including pipes of powerful tone. (5.) _Choir\r\norgan_, of soft, mellow stops, often enclosed in a swell-box. We may add\r\nto these the _pedal organ_, which can be coupled to any but the echo\r\nmanual.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF STOPS.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that the quality of a stop depends on the shape\r\nand construction of the pipe. Some pipes are of wood, others of metal.\r\nSome are rectangular, others circular. Some have parallel sides, others\r\ntaper or expand towards the top. Some are open, others stopped.\r\n\r\nThe two main classes into which organ pipes may be divided are:--(1.)\r\n_Flue_ pipes, in which the wind is directed against a lip, as in Fig.\r\n138. (2.) _Reed_ pipes--that is, pipes used in combination with a\r\nsimple device for admitting air into the bottom of the pipe in a series\r\nof gusts. Fig. 144 shows a _striking_ reed, such as is found in the\r\nordinary motor horn. The elastic metal tongue when at rest stands a very\r\nshort distance away from the orifice in the reed. When wind is blown\r\nthrough the reed the tongue is sucked against the reed, blocks the\r\ncurrent, and springs away again. A _free_ reed has a tongue which\r\nvibrates in a slot without actually touching the sides. Harmonium and\r\nconcertina reeds are of this type. In the organ the reed admits air to a\r\npipe of the correct length to sympathize with the rate of the puffs of\r\nair which the reed passes. Reed pipes expand towards the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUNING PIPES AND REEDS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--A reed pipe.]\r\n\r\nPipes are tuned by adjusting their length. The plug at the top of a\r\nstopped pipe is pulled out or pushed in a trifle to flatten or sharpen\r\nthe note respectively. An open pipe, if large, has a tongue cut in the\r\nside at the top, which can be pressed inwards or outwards for the\r\npurpose of correcting the tone. Small metal pipes are flattened by\r\ncontracting the tops inwards with a metal cone like a\r\ncandle-extinguisher placed over the top and tapped; and sharpened by\r\nhaving the top splayed by a cone pushed in point downwards. Reeds of the\r\nstriking variety (see Fig. 144) have a tuning-wire pressing on the\r\ntongue near the fixed end. The end of this wire projects through the\r\ncasing. By moving it, the length of the vibrating part of the tongue is\r\nadjusted to correctness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLOWS.\r\n\r\nDifferent stops require different wind-pressures, ranging from 1/10 lb.\r\nto 1 lb. to the square inch, the reeds taking the heaviest pressures.\r\nThere must therefore be as many sets of bellows and wind-chests as there\r\nare different pressures wanted. A very large organ consumes immense\r\nquantities of air when all the stops are out, and the pumping has to be\r\ndone by a powerful gas, water, or electric engine. Every bellows has a\r\nreservoir (see Fig. 143) above it. The top of this is weighted to give\r\nthe pressure required. A valve in the top opens automatically as soon as\r\nthe reservoir has expanded to a certain fixed limit, so that there is no\r\npossibility of bursting the leather sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--The keyboard and part of the pneumatic\r\nmechanism of the Hereford Cathedral organ. C, composition pedals for\r\npushing out groups of stops; P (at bottom), pedals; P P (at top), pipes\r\ncarrying compressed air; M, manuals (4); S S, stops.]\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC AND PNEUMATIC ACTIONS.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned in connection with railway signalling that the\r\nsignalman is sometimes relieved of the hard manual labour of moving\r\nsignals and points by the employment of electric and pneumatic\r\nauxiliaries. The same is true of organs and organists. The touch of the\r\nkeys has been greatly lightened by making the keys open air-valves or\r\ncomplete electric circuits which actuate the mechanism for pulling down\r\nthe pallets. The stops, pedals, and couplers also employ \"power.\" Not\r\nonly are the performer's muscles spared a lot of heavy work when\r\ncompressed air and electricity aid him, but he is able to have the\r\n_console_, or keyboard, far away from the pipes. \"From the console, the\r\nplayer, sitting with the singers, or in any desirable part of the choir\r\nor chancel, would be able to command the working of the whole of the\r\nlargest organ situated afar at the western end of the nave; would draw\r\neach stop in complete reliance on the sliders and the sound-board\r\nfulfilling their office; ... and--marvel of it all--the player, using\r\nthe swell pedal in his ordinary manner, would obtain crescendo and\r\ndiminuendo with a more perfect effect than by the old way.\"[31]\r\n\r\nIn cathedrals it is no uncommon thing for the different sound-boards to\r\nbe placed in positions far apart, so that to the uninitiated there may\r\nappear to be several independent organs scattered about. Yet all are\r\nabsolutely under the control of a man who is sitting away from them all,\r\nbut connected with them by a number of tubes or wires.\r\n\r\nThe largest organ in the world is that in the Town Hall, Sydney. It has\r\na hundred and twenty-six speaking stops, five manuals, fourteen\r\ncouplers, and forty-six combination studs. The pipes, about 8,000 in\r\nnumber, range from the enormous 64-foot contra-trombone to some only a\r\nfraction of an inch in length. The organ occupies a space 85 feet long\r\nand 26 feet deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN REEDS.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful of all musical reeds is found in the human throat, in\r\nthe anatomical part called the _larynx_, situated at the top of the\r\n_trachea_, or windpipe.\r\n\r\nSlip a piece of rubber tubing over the end of a pipe, allowing an inch\r\nor so to project. Take the free part of the tube by two opposite points\r\nbetween the first fingers and thumbs and pull it until the edges are\r\nstretched tight. Now blow through it. The wind, forcing its way between\r\nthe two rubber edges, causes them and the air inside the tube to\r\nvibrate, and a musical note results. The more you strain the rubber the\r\nhigher is the note.\r\n\r\nThe larynx works on this principle. The windpipe takes the place of the\r\nglass pipe; the two vocal cords represent the rubber edges; and the\r\n_arytenoid muscles_ stand instead of the hands. When contracted, these\r\nmuscles bring the edges of the cords nearer to one another, stretch the\r\ncords, and shorten the cords. A person gifted with a \"very good ear\"\r\ncan, it has been calculated, adjust the length of the vocal cords to\r\n1/17000th of an inch!\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the adjustment of the cords is effected the\r\nadjustment of the length of the windpipe, so that the column of air in\r\nit may be of the right length to vibrate in unison. Here again is seen a\r\nwonderful provision of nature.\r\n\r\nThe resonance of the mouth cavity is also of great importance. By\r\naltering the shape of the mouth the various harmonics of any fundamental\r\nnote produced by the larynx are rendered prominent, and so we get the\r\ndifferent vocal sounds. Helmholtz has shown that the fundamental tone of\r\nany note is represented by the sound _oo_. If the mouth is adjusted to\r\nbring out the octave of the fundamental, _o_ results. _a_ is produced by\r\naccentuating the second harmonic, the twelfth; _ee_ by developing the\r\nsecond and fourth harmonics; while for _ah_ the fifth and seventh must\r\nbe prominent.\r\n\r\nWhen we whistle we transform the lips into a reed and the mouth into a\r\npipe. The tension of the lips and the shape of the mouth cavity decide\r\nthe note. The lips are also used as a reed for blowing the flute,\r\npiccolo, and all the brass band instruments of the cornet order. In\r\nblowing a coach-horn the various harmonics of the fundamental note are\r\nbrought out by altering the lip tension and the wind pressure. A cornet\r\nis practically a coach-horn rolled up into a convenient shape and\r\nfurnished with three keys, the depression of which puts extra lengths of\r\ntubing in connection with the main tube--in fact, makes it longer. One\r\nkey lowers the fundamental note of the horn half a tone; the second, a\r\nfull tone; the third, a tone and a half. If the first and third are\r\npressed down together, the note sinks two tones; if the second and\r\nthird, two and a half tones; and simultaneous depression of all three\r\ngives a drop of three tones. The performer thus has seven possible\r\nfundamental notes, and several harmonics of each of these at his\r\ncommand; so that by a proper manipulation of the keys he can run up the\r\nchromatic scale.\r\n\r\nWe should add that the cornet tube is an \"open\" pipe. So is that of the\r\nflute. The clarionet is a \"stopped\" pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[29] It is obvious that in Fig. 136, _2_, a pulse will pass from A to B\r\nand back in one-third the time required for it to pass from A to B and\r\nback in Fig. 136, _1_.\r\n\r\n[30] The science of hearing; from the Greek verb, [Greek: akouein], \"to\r\nhear.\"\r\n\r\n[31] \"Organs and Tuning,\" p. 245.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\n\r\nTALKING-MACHINES.\r\n\r\n     The phonograph--The recorder--The reproducer--The gramophone--The\r\n     making of records--Cylinder records--Gramophone records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Patent Office Museum at South Kensington is a curious little\r\npiece of machinery--a metal cylinder mounted on a long axle, which has\r\nat one end a screw thread chased along it. The screw end rotates in a\r\nsocket with a thread of equal pitch cut in it. To the other end is\r\nattached a handle. On an upright near the cylinder is mounted a sort of\r\ndrum. The membrane of the drum carries a needle, which, when the\r\nmembrane is agitated by the air-waves set up by human speech, digs into\r\na sheet of tinfoil wrapped round the cylinder, pressing it into a\r\nhelical groove turned on the cylinder from end to end. This construction\r\nis the first phonograph ever made. Thomas Edison, the \"wizard of the\r\nWest,\" devised it in 1876; and from this rude parent have descended the\r\nbeautiful machines which record and reproduce human speech and musical\r\nsounds with startling accuracy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--The \"governor\" of a phonograph.]\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to trace here the development of the talking-machine;\r\nnor will it be necessary to describe in detail its mechanism, which is\r\nprobably well known to most readers, or could be mastered in a very\r\nshort time on personal examination. We will content ourselves with\r\nsaying that the wax cylinder of the phonograph, or the ebonite disc of\r\nthe gramophone, is generally rotated by clockwork concealed in the body\r\nof the machine. The speed of rotation has to be very carefully governed,\r\nin order that the record may revolve under the reproducing point at a\r\nuniform speed. The principle of the governor commonly used appears in\r\nFig. 146. The last pinion of the clockwork train is mounted on a shaft\r\ncarrying two triangular plates, A and C, to which are attached three\r\nshort lengths of flat steel spring with a heavy ball attached to the\r\ncentre of each. A is fixed; C moves up the shaft as the balls fly out,\r\nand pulls with it the disc D, which rubs against the pad P (on the end\r\nof a spring) and sets up sufficient friction to slow the clockwork. The\r\nlimit rate is regulated by screw S.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHONOGRAPH.\r\n\r\nThough the recording and reproducing apparatus of a phonograph gives\r\nvery wonderful results, its construction is quite simple. At the same\r\ntime, it must be borne in mind that an immense amount of experimenting\r\nhas been devoted to finding out the most suitable materials and forms\r\nfor the parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--Section of an Edison Bell phonograph\r\nrecorder.]\r\n\r\nThe _recorder_ (Fig. 147) is a little circular box about one and a half\r\ninches in diameter.[32] From the top a tube leads to the horn. The\r\nbottom is a circular plate, C C, hinged at one side. This plate supports\r\na glass disc, D, about 1/150th of an inch thick, to which is attached\r\nthe cutting stylus--a tiny sapphire rod with a cup-shaped end having\r\nvery sharp edges. Sound-waves enter the box through the horn tube; but\r\ninstead of being allowed to fill the whole box, they are concentrated by\r\nthe shifting nozzle N on to the centre of the glass disc through the\r\nhole in C C. You will notice that N has a ball end, and C C a socket to\r\nfit N exactly, so that, though C C and N move up and down very rapidly,\r\nthey still make perfect contact. The disc is vibrated by the\r\nsound-impulses, and drives the cutting point down into the surface of\r\nthe wax cylinder, turning below it in a clockwork direction. The only\r\ndead weight pressing on S is that of N, C C, and the glass diaphragm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.--Perspective view of a phonograph recorder.]\r\n\r\nAs the cylinder revolves, the recorder is shifted continuously along by\r\na leading screw having one hundred or more threads to the inch cut on\r\nit, so that it traces a continuous helical groove from one end of the\r\nwax cylinder to the other. This groove is really a series of very minute\r\nindentations, not exceeding 1/1000th of an inch in depth.[33] Seen under\r\na microscope, the surface of the record is a succession of hills and\r\nvalleys, some much larger than others (Fig. 151, _a_). A loud sound\r\ncauses the stylus to give a vigorous dig, while low sounds scarcely move\r\nit at all. The wonderful thing about this sound-recording is, that not\r\nonly are the fundamental tones of musical notes impressed, but also the\r\nharmonics, which enable us to decide at once whether the record is one\r\nof a cornet, violin, or banjo performance. Furthermore, if several\r\ninstruments are playing simultaneously near the recorder's horn, the\r\nstylus catches all the different shades of tone of every note of a\r\nchord. There are, so to speak, minor hills and valleys cut in the slopes\r\nof the main hills and valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--Section of the reproducer of an Edison Bell\r\nphonograph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.--Perspective view of a phonograph reproducer.]\r\n\r\nThe _reproducer_ (Fig. 149) is somewhat more complicated than the\r\nrecorder. As before, we have a circular box communicating with the horn\r\nof the instrument. A thin glass disc forms a bottom to the box. It is\r\nheld in position between rubber rings, R R, by a screw collar, C. To the\r\ncentre is attached a little eye, from which hangs a link, L. Pivoted at\r\nP from one edge of the box is a _floating weight_, having a circular\r\nopening immediately under the eye. The link passes through this to the\r\nleft end of a tiny lever, which rocks on a pivot projecting from the\r\nweight. To the right end of the lever is affixed a sapphire bar, or\r\nstylus, with a ball end of a diameter equal to that of the cutting point\r\nof the recorder. The floating weight presses the stylus against the\r\nrecord, and also keeps the link between the rocking lever of the glass\r\ndiaphragm in a state of tension. Every blow given to the stylus is\r\ntherefore transmitted by the link to the diaphragm, which vibrates and\r\nsends an air-impulse into the horn. As the impulses are given at the\r\nsame rate as those which agitated the diaphragm of the recorder, the\r\nsounds which they represent are accurately reproduced, even to the\r\nharmonics of a musical note.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMOPHONE.\r\n\r\nThis effects the same purpose as the phonograph, but in a somewhat\r\ndifferent manner. The phonograph recorder digs vertically downwards into\r\nthe surface of the record, whereas the stylus of the gramophone wags\r\nfrom side to side and describes a snaky course (Fig. 151_b_). It makes\r\nno difference in talking-machines whether the reproducing stylus be\r\nmoved sideways or vertically by the record, provided that motion is\r\nimparted by it to the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151_a._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151_b._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151_c._--Section of a gramophone reproducer.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 151_c_ the construction of the gramophone reproducer is shown in\r\nsection. A is the cover which screws on to the bottom B, and confines\r\nthe diaphragm D between itself and a rubber ring. The portion B is\r\nelongated into a tubular shape for connection with the horn, an arm of\r\nwhich slides over the tube and presses against the rubber ring C to make\r\nan air-tight joint. The needle-carrier N is attached at its upper end to\r\nthe centre of the diaphragm. At a point indicated by the white dot a pin\r\npasses through it and the cover. The lower end is tubular to accommodate\r\nthe steel points, which have to be replaced after passing once over a\r\nrecord. A screw, S, working in a socket projecting from the carrier,\r\nholds the point fast. The record moves horizontally under the point in a\r\nplane perpendicular to the page. The groove being zigzag, the needle\r\nvibrates right and left, and rotating the carrier a minute fraction of\r\nan inch on the pivot, shakes the glass diaphragm and sends waves of air\r\ninto the horn.\r\n\r\nThe gramophone is a reproducing instrument only. The records are made on\r\na special machine, fitted with a device for causing the recorder point\r\nto describe a spiral course from the circumference to the centre of the\r\nrecord disc. Some gramophone records have as many as 250 turns to the\r\ninch. The total length of the tracing on a ten-inch \"concert\" record is\r\nabout 1,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF RECORDS.\r\n\r\nFor commercial purposes it would not pay to make every record separately\r\nin a recording machine. The expense of employing good singers and\r\ninstrumentalists renders such a method impracticable. All the records we\r\nbuy are made from moulds, the preparation of which we will now briefly\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYLINDER, OR PHONOGRAPH RECORDS.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, a wax record is made in the ordinary way on a recording\r\nmachine. After being tested and approved, it is hung vertically and\r\ncentrally from a rotating table pivoted on a vertical metal spike\r\npassing up through the record. On one side of the table is a piece of\r\niron. On each side of the record, and a small distance away, rises a\r\nbrass rod enclosed in a glass tube. The top of the rods are hooked, so\r\nthat pieces of gold leaf may be suspended from them. A bell-glass is now\r\nplaced over the record, table, and rods, and the air is sucked out by a\r\npump. As soon as a good vacuum has been obtained, the current from the\r\nsecondary circuit of an induction coil is sent into the rods supporting\r\nthe gold leaves, which are volatilized by the current jumping from one\r\nto the other. A magnet, whirled outside the bell-glass, draws round the\r\niron armature on the pivoted table, and consequently revolves the\r\nrecord, on the surface of which a very thin coating of gold is\r\ndeposited. The record is next placed in an electroplating bath until a\r\ncopper shell one-sixteenth of an inch thick has formed all over the\r\noutside. This is trued up on a lathe and encased in a brass tube. The\r\n\"master,\" or original wax record, is removed by cooling it till it\r\ncontracts sufficiently to fall out of the copper mould, on the inside\r\nsurface of which are reproduced, in relief, the indentations of the wax\r\n\"master.\"\r\n\r\nCopies are made from the mould by immersing it in a tank of melted wax.\r\nThe cold metal chills the wax that touches it, so that the mould soon\r\nhas a thick waxen lining. The mould and copy are removed from the tank\r\nand mounted on a lathe, which shapes and smooths the inside of the\r\nrecord. The record is loosened from the mould by cooling. After\r\ninspection for flaws, it is, if found satisfactory, packed in\r\ncotton-wool and added to the saleable stock.\r\n\r\nGramophone master records are made on a circular disc of zinc, coated\r\nover with a very thin film of acid-proof fat. When the disc is revolved\r\nin the recording machine, the sharp stylus cuts through the fat and\r\nexposes the zinc beneath. On immersion in a bath of chromic acid the\r\nbared surfaces are bitten into, while the unexposed parts remain\r\nunaffected. When the etching is considered complete, the plate is\r\ncarefully cleaned and tested. A negative copper copy is made from it by\r\nelectrotyping. This constitutes the mould. From it as many as 1,000\r\ncopies may be made on ebonite plates by combined pressure and heating.\r\n\r\n[32] The Edison Bell phonograph is here referred to.\r\n\r\n[33] Some of the sibilant or hissing sounds of the voice are computed to\r\nbe represented by depressions less than a millionth of an inch in depth.\r\nYet these are reproduced very clearly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\n\r\nWHY THE WIND BLOWS.\r\n\r\n     Why the wind blows--Land and sea breezes--Light air and\r\n     moisture--The barometer--The column barometer--The wheel\r\n     barometer--A very simple barometer--The aneroid\r\n     barometer--Barometers and weather--The diving-bell--The\r\n     diving-dress--Air-pumps--Pneumatic tyres--The air-gun--The\r\n     self-closing door-stop--The action of wind on oblique surfaces--The\r\n     balloon--The flying-machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a child's rubber ball gets slack through a slight leakage of air,\r\nand loses some of its bounce, it is a common practice to hold it for a\r\nfew minutes in front of the fire till it becomes temporarily taut again.\r\nWhy does the heat have this effect on the ball? No more air has been\r\nforced into the ball. After perusing the chapter on the steam-engine the\r\nreader will be able to supply the answer. \"Because the molecules of air\r\ndash about more vigorously among one another when the air is heated, and\r\nby striking the inside of the ball with greater force put it in a state\r\nof greater tension.\"\r\n\r\nIf we heat an open jar there is no pressure developed, since the air\r\nsimply expands and flows out of the neck. But the air that remains in\r\nthe jar, being less in quantity than when it was not yet heated, weighs\r\nless, though occupying the same space as before. If we took a very thin\r\nbladder and filled it with hot air it would therefore float in colder\r\nair, proving that heated air, as we should expect, _tends to rise_. The\r\nfire-balloon employs this principle, the air inside the bag being kept\r\nartificially warm by a fire burning in some vessel attached below the\r\nopen neck of the bag.\r\n\r\nNow, the sun shines with different degrees of heating power at different\r\nparts of the world. Where its effect is greatest the air there is\r\nhottest. We will suppose, for the sake of argument, that, at a certain\r\nmoment, the air envelope all round the globe is of equal temperature.\r\nSuddenly the sun shines out and heats the air at a point, A, till it is\r\nmany degrees warmer than the surrounding air. The heated air expands,\r\nrises, and spreads out above the cold air. But, as a given depth of warm\r\nair has less weight than an equal depth of cold air, the cold air at\r\nonce begins to rush towards B and squeeze the rest of the warm air out.\r\nWe may therefore picture the atmosphere as made up of a number of\r\ncolder currents passing along the surface of the earth to replace warm\r\ncurrents rising and spreading over the upper surface of the cold air. A\r\nsimilar circulation takes place in a vessel of heated water (see p. 17).\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND AND SEA BREEZES.\r\n\r\nA breeze which blows from the sea on to the land during the day often\r\nreverses its direction during the evening. Why is this? The earth grows\r\nhot or cold more rapidly than the sea. When the sun shines hotly, the\r\nland warms quickly and heats the air over it, which becomes light, and\r\nis displaced by the cooler air over the sea. When the sun sets, the\r\nearth and the air over it lose their warmth quickly, while the sea\r\nremains at practically the same temperature as before. So the balance is\r\nchanged, the heavier air now lying over the land. It therefore flows\r\nseawards, and drives out the warmer air there.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT AIR AND MOISTURE.\r\n\r\nLight, warm air absorbs moisture. As it cools, the moisture in it\r\ncondenses. Breathe on a plate, and you notice that a watery film forms\r\non it at once. The cold surface condenses the water suspended in the\r\nwarm breath. If you wish to dry a damp room you heat it. Moisture then\r\npasses from the walls and objects in the room to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nThis property of air is responsible for the changes in weather. Light,\r\nmoisture-laden air meets cold, dry air, and the sudden cooling forces it\r\nto release its moisture, which falls as rain, or floats about as clouds.\r\nIf only we are able to detect the presence of warm air-strata above us,\r\nwe ought to be in a position to foretell the weather.\r\n\r\nWe can judge of the specific gravity of the air in our neighbourhood by\r\nmeans of the barometer, which means \"weight-measurer.\" The normal\r\nair-pressure at sea-level on our bodies or any other objects is about 15\r\nlbs. to the square inch--that is to say, if you could imprison and weigh\r\na column of air one inch square in section and of the height of the\r\nworld's atmospheric envelope, the scale would register 15 lbs. Many\r\nyears ago (1643) Torricelli, a pupil of Galileo, first calculated the\r\npressure by a very simple experiment. He took a long glass tube sealed\r\nat one end, filled it with mercury, and, closing the open end with the\r\nthumb, inverted the tube and plunged the open end below the surface of a\r\ntank of mercury. On removing his thumb he found that the mercury sank in\r\nthe tube till the surface of the mercury in the tube was about 30 inches\r\nin a vertical direction above the surface of the mercury in the tank.\r\nNow, as the upper end was sealed, there must be a vacuum _above_ the\r\nmercury. What supported the column? The atmosphere. So it was evident\r\nthat the downward pressure of the mercury exactly counterbalanced the\r\nupward pressure of the air. As a mercury column 30 inches high and 1\r\ninch square weighs 15 lbs., the air-pressure on a square inch obviously\r\nis the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--A Fortin barometer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTIN'S COLUMN BAROMETER\r\n\r\nis a simple Torricellian tube, T, with the lower end submerged in a\r\nlittle glass tank of mercury (Fig. 152). The bottom of this tank is made\r\nof washleather. To obtain a \"reading\" the screw S, pressing on the\r\nwashleather, is adjusted until the mercury in the tank rises to the tip\r\nof the little ivory point P. The reading is the figure of the scale on\r\nthe face of the case opposite which the surface of the column stands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHEEL BAROMETER\r\n\r\nalso employs the mercury column (Fig. 153). The lower end of the tube is\r\nturned up and expanded to form a tank, C. The pointer P, which travels\r\nround a graduated dial, is mounted on a spindle carrying a pulley, over\r\nwhich passes a string with a weight at each end. The heavier of the\r\nweights rests on the top of the mercury. When the atmospheric pressure\r\nfalls, the mercury in C rises, lifting this weight, and the pointer\r\nmoves. This form of barometer is not so delicate or reliable as\r\nFortin's, or as the siphon barometer, which has a tube of the same shape\r\nas the wheel instrument, but of the same diameter from end to end\r\nexcept for a contraction at the bend. The reading of a siphon is the\r\ndistance between the two surfaces of the mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY SIMPLE BAROMETER\r\n\r\nis made by knocking off the neck of a small bottle, filling the body\r\nwith water, and hanging it up by a string in the position shown (Fig.\r\n154). When the atmospheric pressure falls, the water at the orifice\r\nbulges outwards; when it rises, the water retreats till its surface is\r\nslightly concave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANEROID BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nOn account of their size and weight, and the comparative difficulty of\r\ntransporting them without derangement of the mercury column, column\r\nbarometers are not so generally used as the aneroid variety. Aneroid\r\nmeans \"without moisture,\" and in this particular connection signifies\r\nthat no liquid is used in the construction of the barometer.\r\n\r\nFig. 155 shows an aneroid in detail. The most noticeable feature is the\r\nvacuum chamber, V C, a circular box which has a top and bottom of\r\ncorrugated but thin and elastic metal. Sections of the box are shown in\r\nFigs. 156, 157. It is attached at the bottom to the base board of the\r\ninstrument by a screw (Fig. 156). From the top rises a pin, P, with a\r\ntransverse hole through it to accommodate the pin K E, which has a\r\ntriangular section, and stands on one edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--An aneroid barometer.]\r\n\r\nReturning to Fig. 155, we see that P projects through S, a powerful\r\nspring of sheet-steel. To this is attached a long arm, C, the free end\r\nof which moves a link rotating, through the pin E, a spindle mounted in\r\na frame, D. The spindle moves arm F. This pulls on a very minute chain\r\nwound round the pointer spindle B, in opposition to a hairspring, H S. B\r\nis mounted on arm H, which is quite independent of the rest of the\r\naneroid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156. FIG. 157. The vacuum chamber of an aneroid\r\nbarometer extended and compressed.]\r\n\r\nThe vacuum chamber is exhausted during manufacture and sealed. It would\r\nnaturally assume the shape of Fig. 157, but the spring S, acting against\r\nthe atmospheric pressure, pulls it out. As the pressure varies, so does\r\nthe spring rise or sink; and the slightest movement is transmitted\r\nthrough the multiplying arms C, E, F, to the pointer.\r\n\r\nA good aneroid is so delicate that it will register the difference in\r\npressure caused by raising it from the floor to the table, where it has\r\na couple of feet less of air-column resting upon it. An aneroid is\r\ntherefore a valuable help to mountaineers for determining their altitude\r\nabove sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAROMETERS AND WEATHER.\r\n\r\nWe may now return to the consideration of forecasting the weather by\r\nmovements of the barometer. The first thing to keep in mind is, that the\r\ninstrument is essentially a _weight_ recorder. How is weather connected\r\nwith atmospheric weight?\r\n\r\nIn England the warm south-west wind generally brings wet weather, the\r\nnorth and east winds fine weather; the reason for this being that the\r\nfirst reaches us after passing over the Atlantic and picking up a\r\nquantity of moisture, while the second and third have come overland and\r\ndeposited their moisture before reaching us.\r\n\r\nA sinking of the barometer heralds the approach of heated air--that is,\r\nmoist air--which on meeting colder air sheds its moisture. So when the\r\nmercury falls we expect rain. On the other hand, when the \"glass\" rises,\r\nwe know that colder air is coming, and as colder air comes from a dry\r\nquarter we anticipate fine weather. It does not follow that the same\r\nconditions are found in all parts of the world. In regions which have\r\nthe ocean to the east or the north, the winds blowing thence would be\r\nthe rainy winds, while south-westerly winds might bring hot and dry\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIVING-BELL.\r\n\r\nWater is nearly 773 times as heavy as air. If we submerge a barometer a\r\nvery little way below the surface of a water tank, we shall at once\r\nobserve a rise of the mercury column. At a depth of 34 feet the pressure\r\non any submerged object is 15 lbs. to the square inch, in addition to\r\nthe atmospheric pressure of 15 lbs. per square inch--that is, there\r\nwould be a 30-lb. _absolute_ pressure. As a rule, when speaking of\r\nhydraulic pressures, we start with the normal atmospheric pressure as\r\nzero, and we will here observe the practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.--A diving bell.]\r\n\r\nThe diving-bell is used to enable people to work under water without\r\nhaving recourse to the diving-dress. A sketch of an ordinary\r\ndiving-bell is given in Fig. 158. It may be described as a square iron\r\nbox without a bottom. At the top are links by which it is attached to a\r\nlowering chain, and windows, protected by grids; also a nozzle for the\r\nair-tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.]\r\n\r\nA simple model bell (Fig. 159) is easily made out of a glass tumbler\r\nwhich has had a tap fitted in a hole drilled through the bottom. We turn\r\noff the tap and plunge the glass into a vessel of water. The water rises\r\na certain way up the interior, until the air within has been compressed\r\nto a pressure equal to that of the water at the level of the surface\r\ninside. The further the tumbler is lowered, the higher does the water\r\nrise inside it.\r\n\r\nEvidently men could not work in a diving-bell which is invaded thus by\r\nwater. It is imperative to keep the water at bay. This we can do by\r\nattaching a tube to the tap (Fig. 160) and blowing into the tumbler till\r\nthe air-pressure exceeds that of the water, which is shown by bubbles\r\nrising to the surface. The diving-bell therefore has attached to it a\r\nhose through which air is forced by pumps from the atmosphere above, at\r\na pressure sufficient to keep the water out of the bell. This pumping of\r\nair also maintains a fresh supply of oxygen for the workers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.]\r\n\r\nInside the bell is tackle for grappling any object that has to be moved,\r\nsuch as a heavy stone block. The diving-bell is used mostly for laying\r\nsubmarine masonry. \"The bell, slung either from a crane on the masonry\r\nalready built above sea-level, or from a specially fitted barge, comes\r\ninto action. The block is lowered by its own crane on to the bottom. The\r\nbell descends upon it, and the crew seize it with tackle suspended\r\ninside the bell. Instructions are sent up as to the direction in which\r\nthe bell should be moved with its burden, and as soon as the exact spot\r\nhas been reached the signal for lowering is given, and the stone settles\r\non to the cement laid ready for it.\"[34]\r\n\r\nFor many purposes it is necessary that the worker should have more\r\nfreedom of action than is possible when he is cooped up inside an iron\r\nbox. Hence the invention of the\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVING-DRESS,\r\n\r\nwhich consists of two main parts, the helmet and the dress proper. The\r\nhelmet (Fig. 161) is made of copper. A breastplate, B, shaped to fit the\r\nshoulders, has at the neck a segmental screw bayonet-joint. The\r\nheadpiece is fitted with a corresponding screw, which can be attached or\r\nremoved by one-eighth of a turn. The neck edge of the dress, which is\r\nmade in one piece, legs, arms, body and all, is attached to the\r\nbreastplate by means of the plate P^1, screwed down tightly on it by\r\nthe wing-nuts N N, the bolts of which pass through the breastplate. Air\r\nenters the helmet through a valve situated at the back, and is led\r\nthrough tubes along the inside to the front. This valve closes\r\nautomatically if any accident cuts off the air supply, and encloses\r\nsufficient air in the dress to allow the diver to regain the surface.\r\nThe outlet valve O V can be adjusted by the diver to maintain any\r\npressure. At the sides of the headpiece are two hooks, H, over which\r\npass the cords connecting the heavy lead weights of 40 lbs. each hanging\r\non the diver's breast and back. These weights are also attached to the\r\nknobs K K. A pair of boots, having 17 lbs. of lead each in the soles,\r\ncomplete the dress. Three glazed windows are placed in the headpiece,\r\nthat in the front, R W, being removable, so that the diver may gain free\r\naccess to the air when he is above water without being obliged to take\r\noff the helmet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.--A diver's helmet.]\r\n\r\nBy means of telephone wires built into the life-line (which passes\r\nunder the diver's arms and is used for lowering and hoisting) easy\r\ncommunication is established between the diver and his attendants above.\r\nThe transmitter of the telephone is placed inside the helmet between the\r\nfront and a side window, the receiver and the button of an electric bell\r\nin the crown. This last he can press by raising his head. The life-line\r\nsometimes also includes the wires for an electric lamp (Fig. 162) used\r\nby the diver at depths to which daylight cannot penetrate.\r\n\r\nThe pressure on a diver's body increases in the ratio of 4-1/3 lbs. per\r\nsquare inch for every 10 feet that he descends. The ordinary working\r\nlimit is about 150 feet, though \"old hands\" are able to stand greater\r\npressures. The record is held by one James Hooper, who, when removing\r\nthe cargo of the _Cape Horn_ sunk off the South American coast, made\r\nseven descents of 201 feet, one of which lasted for forty-two minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--Diver's electric lamp.]\r\n\r\nA sketch is given (Fig. 163) of divers working below water with\r\npneumatic tools, fed from above with high-pressure air. Owing to his\r\nbuoyancy a diver has little depressing or pushing power, and he cannot\r\nbore a hole in a post with an auger unless he is able to rest his back\r\nagainst some firm object, or is roped to the post. Pneumatic chipping\r\ntools merely require holding to their work, their weight offering\r\nsufficient resistance to the very rapid blows which they make.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--Divers at work below water with pneumatic\r\ntools.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR-PUMPS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.]\r\n\r\nMention having been made of the air-pump, we append diagrams (Figs. 164,\r\n165) of the simplest form of air-pump, the cycle tyre inflator. The\r\npiston is composed of two circular plates of smaller diameter than the\r\nbarrel, holding between them a cup leather. During the upstroke the cup\r\ncollapses inwards and allows air to pass by it. On the downstroke (Fig.\r\n165) the edges of the cup expand against the barrel, preventing the\r\npassage of air round the piston. A double-action air-pump requires a\r\nlong, well-fitting piston with a cup on each side of it, and the\r\naddition of extra valves to the barrel, as the cups under these\r\ncircumstances cannot act as valves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMATIC TYRES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.]\r\n\r\nThe action of the pneumatic tyre in reducing vibration and increasing\r\nthe speed of a vehicle is explained by Figs. 166, 167. When the tyre\r\nencounters an obstacle, such as a large stone, it laps over it (Fig.\r\n166), and while supporting the weight on the wheel, reduces the\r\ndeflection of the direction of movement. When an iron-tyred wheel meets\r\na similar obstacle it has to rise right over it, often jumping a\r\nconsiderable distance into the air. The resultant motions of the wheel\r\nare indicated in each case by an arrow. Every change of direction means\r\na loss of forward velocity, the loss increasing with the violence and\r\nextent of the change. The pneumatic tyre also scores because, on account\r\nof its elasticity, it gives a \"kick off\" against the obstacle, which\r\ncompensates for the resistance during compression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--Section of the mechanism of an air-gun.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AIR-GUN.\r\n\r\nThis may be described as a valveless air-pump. Fig. 168 is a section of\r\na \"Gem\" air-gun, with the mechanism set ready for firing. In the stock\r\nof the gun is the _cylinder_, in which an accurately fitting and hollow\r\n_piston_ moves. A powerful helical spring, turned out of a solid bar of\r\nsteel, is compressed between the inside end of the piston and the upper\r\nend of the butt. To set the gun, the _catch_ is pressed down so that its\r\nhooked end disengages from the stock, and the barrel is bent downwards\r\non pivot P. This slides the lower end of the _compressing lever_ towards\r\nthe butt, and a projection on the guide B, working in a groove, takes\r\nthe piston with it. When the spring has been fully compressed, the\r\ntriangular tip of the rocking cam R engages with a groove in the\r\npiston's head, and prevents recoil when the barrel is returned to its\r\noriginal position. On pulling the trigger, the piston is released and\r\nflies up the cylinder with great force, and the air in the cylinder is\r\ncompressed and driven through the bore of the barrel, blocked by the\r\nleaden slug, to which the whole energy of the expanding spring is\r\ntransmitted through the elastic medium of the air.\r\n\r\nThere are several other good types of air-gun, all of which employ the\r\nprinciples described above.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SELF-CLOSING DOOR-STOP\r\n\r\nis another interesting pneumatic device. It consists of a cylinder with\r\nan air-tight piston, and a piston rod working through a cover at one\r\nend. The other end of the cylinder is pivoted to the door frame. When\r\nthe door is opened the piston compresses a spring in the cylinder, and\r\nair is admitted past a cup leather on the piston to the upper part of\r\nthe cylinder. This air is confined by the cup leather when the door is\r\nreleased, and escapes slowly through a leak, allowing the spring to\r\nregain its shape slowly, and by the agency of the piston rod to close\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION OF WIND ON OBLIQUE SURFACES.\r\n\r\nWhy does a kite rise? Why does a boat sail across the wind? We can\r\nsupply an answer almost instinctively in both cases, \"Because the wind\r\npushes the kite or sail aside.\" It will, however, be worth while to look\r\nfor a more scientific answer. The kite cannot travel in the direction of\r\nthe wind because it is confined by a string. But the face is so attached\r\nto the string that it inclines at an angle to the direction of the wind.\r\nNow, when a force meets an inclined surface which it cannot carry along\r\nwith it, but which is free to travel in another direction, the force may\r\nbe regarded as resolving itself into _two_ forces, coming from each side\r\nof the original line. These are called the _component_ forces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.]\r\n\r\nTo explain this we give a simple sketch of a kite in the act of flying\r\n(Fig. 169). The wind is blowing in the direction of the solid arrow A.\r\nThe oblique surface of the kite resolves its force into the two\r\ncomponents indicated by the dotted arrows B and C. Of these C only has\r\nlifting power to overcome the force of gravity. The kite assumes a\r\nposition in which force C and gravity counterbalance one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.]\r\n\r\nA boat sailing across the wind is acted on in a similar manner (Fig.\r\n170). The wind strikes the sail obliquely, and would thrust it to\r\nleeward were it not for the opposition of the water. The force A is\r\nresolved into forces B and C, of which C propels the boat on the line of\r\nits axis. The boat can be made to sail even \"up\" the wind, her head\r\nbeing brought round until a point is reached at which the force B on the\r\nboat, masts, etc., overcomes the force C. The capability of a boat for\r\nsailing up wind depends on her \"lines\" and the amount of surface she\r\noffers to the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALLOON\r\n\r\nis a pear-shaped bag--usually made of silk--filled with some gas lighter\r\nthan air. The tendency of a heavier medium to displace a lighter drives\r\nthe gas upwards, and with it the bag and the wicker-work car attached to\r\na network encasing the bag. The tapering neck at the lower end is open,\r\nto permit the free escape of gas as the atmospheric pressure outside\r\ndiminishes with increasing elevation. At the top of the bag is a wooden\r\nvalve opening inwards, which can be drawn down by a rope passing up to\r\nit through the neck whenever the aeronaut wishes to let gas escape for a\r\ndescent. He is able to cause a very rapid escape by pulling another cord\r\ndepending from a \"ripping piece\" near the top of the bag. In case of\r\nemergency this is torn away bodily, leaving a large hole. The ballast\r\n(usually sand) carried enables him to maintain a state of equilibrium\r\nbetween the upward pull of the gas and the downward pull of gravity. To\r\nsink he lets out gas, to rise he throws out ballast; and this process\r\ncan be repeated until the ballast is exhausted. The greatest height ever\r\nattained by aeronauts is the 7-1/4 miles, or 37,000 feet, of Messrs.\r\nGlaisher and Coxwell on September 5, 1862. The ascent nearly cost them\r\ntheir lives, for at an elevation of about 30,000 feet they were partly\r\nparalyzed by the rarefaction of the air, and had not Mr. Coxwell been\r\nable to pull the valve rope with his teeth and cause a descent, both\r\nwould have died from want of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.]\r\n\r\nThe _flying-machine_, which scientific engineers have so long been\r\ntrying to produce, will probably be quite independent of balloons, and\r\nwill depend for its ascensive powers on the action of air on oblique\r\nsurfaces. Sir Hiram Maxim's experimental air-ship embodied the\r\nprinciples shown by Fig. 171. On a deck was mounted an engine, E,\r\nextremely powerful for its weight. This drove large propellers, S S.\r\nLarge aeroplanes, of canvas stretched over light frameworks, were set up\r\noverhead, the forward end somewhat higher than the rear. The machine was\r\nrun on rails so arranged as to prevent it rising. Unfortunately an\r\naccident happened at the first trial and destroyed the machine.\r\n\r\nIn actual flight it would be necessary to have a vertical rudder for\r\naltering the horizontal direction, and a horizontal \"tail\" for steering\r\nup or down. The principle of an aeroplane is that of the kite, with this\r\ndifference, that, instead of moving air striking a captive body, a\r\nmoving body is propelled against more or less stationary air. The\r\nresolution of forces is shown by the arrows as before.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time no practical flying-machine has appeared. But\r\nexperimenters are hard at work examining the conditions which must be\r\nfulfilled to enable man to claim the \"dominion of the air.\"\r\n\r\n[34] The \"Romance of Modern Mechanism,\" p. 243\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n     The siphon--The bucket pump--The force-pump--The most marvellous\r\n     pump--The blood channels--The course of the blood--The hydraulic\r\n     press--Household water-supply fittings--The ball-cock--The\r\n     water-meter--Water-supply systems--The household filter--Gas\r\n     traps--Water engines--The cream separator--The \"hydro.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we saw that the pressure of the atmosphere is 15\r\nlbs. to the square inch. Suppose that to a very long tube having a\r\nsectional area of one square inch we fit an air-tight piston (Fig. 172),\r\nand place the lower end of the tube in a vessel of water. On raising the\r\npiston a vacuum would be created in the tube, did not the pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere force water up into the tube behind the piston. The water\r\nwould continue to rise until it reached a point 34 feet perpendicularly\r\nabove the level of the water in the vessel. The column would then weigh\r\n15 lbs., and exactly counterbalance the atmospheric pressure; so that a\r\nfurther raising of the piston would not raise the water any farther. At\r\nsea-level, therefore, the _lifting_ power of a pump by suction is\r\nlimited to 34 feet. On the top of a lofty mountain, where the\r\nair-pressure is less, the height of the column would be diminished--in\r\nfact, be proportional to the pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIPHON\r\n\r\nis an interesting application of the principle of suction. By its own\r\nweight water may be made to lift water through a height not exceeding 34\r\nfeet. This is explained by Fig. 173. The siphon pipe, A B C D, is in the\r\nfirst instance filled by suction. The weight of the water between A and\r\nB counter-balances that between B and C. But the column C D hangs, as it\r\nwere, to the heels of B C, and draws it down. Or, to put it otherwise,\r\nthe column B D, being heavier than the column B A, draws it over the\r\ntopmost point of the siphon. Any parting between the columns, provided\r\nthat B A does not exceed 34 feet, is impossible, as the pressure of the\r\natmosphere on the mouth of B A is sufficient to prevent the formation of\r\na vacuum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUCKET PUMP.\r\n\r\nWe may now pass to the commonest form of pump used in houses, stables,\r\ngardens, etc. (Fig. 174). The piston has a large hole through it, over\r\nthe top of which a valve is hinged. At the bottom of the barrel is a\r\nsecond valve, also opening upwards, seated on the top of the supply\r\npipe. In sketch (_a_) the first upstroke is in progress. A vacuum forms\r\nunder the piston, or plunger, and water rises up the barrel to fill it.\r\nThe next diagram (_b_) shows the first downstroke. The plunger valve\r\nnow opens and allows water to rise above the piston, while the lower\r\ncloses under the pressure of the water above and the pull of that below.\r\nDuring the second upstroke (_c_) the water above the piston is raised\r\nuntil it overflows through the spout, while a fresh supply is being\r\nsucked in below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORCE-PUMP.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175. Force-pump; suction stroke.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176. Force-pump; delivery stroke.]\r\n\r\nFor driving water to levels above that of the pump a somewhat different\r\narrangement is required. One type of force-pump is shown in Figs. 175,\r\n176. The piston now is solid, and the upper valve is situated in the\r\ndelivery pipe. During an upstroke this closes, and the other opens; the\r\nreverse happening during a downstroke. An air-chamber is generally\r\nfitted to the delivery pipe when water is to be lifted to great heights\r\nor under high pressure. At each delivery stroke the air in the chamber\r\nis compressed, absorbing some of the shock given to the water in the\r\npipe by the water coming from the pump; and its expansion during the\r\nnext suction stroke forces the water gradually up the pipe. The\r\nair-chamber is a very prominent feature of the fire-engine.\r\n\r\nA _double-action_ force-pump is seen in Fig. 177, making an upward\r\nstroke. Both sides of the piston are here utilized, and the piston rod\r\nworks through a water-tight stuffing-box. The action of the pump will be\r\neasily understood from the diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOST MARVELLOUS PUMP\r\n\r\nknown is the _heart_. We give in Fig. 178 a diagrammatic sketch of the\r\nsystem of blood circulation in the human body, showing the heart, the\r\narteries, and the veins, big and little. The body is supposed to be\r\nfacing the reader, so that the left lung, etc., is to his right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.--A diagrammatic representation of the\r\ncirculatory system of the blood.]\r\n\r\nThe heart, which forces the blood through the body, is a large muscle\r\n(of about the size of the clenched fist) with four cavities. These are\r\nrespectively known as the right and left _auricles_, and the right and\r\nleft _ventricles_. They are arranged in two pairs, the auricle\r\nuppermost, separated by a fleshy partition. Between each auricle and its\r\nventricle is a valve, which consists of strong membranous flaps, with\r\nloose edges turned downwards. The left-side valve is the _mitral_ valve,\r\nthat between the right auricle and ventricle the _tricuspid_ valve. The\r\nedges of the valves fall together when the heart contracts, and prevent\r\nthe passage of blood. Each ventricle has a second valve through which it\r\nejects the blood. (That of the right ventricle has been shown double for\r\nthe sake of convenience.)\r\n\r\nThe action of the heart is this:--The auricles and ventricles expand;\r\nblood rushes into the auricles from the channels supplying them, and\r\ndistends them and the ventricles; the auricles contract and fill the\r\nventricles below quite full (there are no valves above the auricles, but\r\nthe force of contraction is not sufficient to return the blood to the\r\nveins); the ventricles contract; the mitral and tricuspid valves close;\r\nthe valves leading to the arteries open; blood is forced out of the\r\nventricles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLOOD CHANNELS\r\n\r\nare of two kinds--(1) The _arteries_, which lead the blood into the\r\ncirculatory system; (2) the _veins_, which lead the blood back to the\r\nheart. The arteries divide up into branches, and these again divide into\r\nsmaller and smaller arteries. The smallest, termed _capillaries_ (Latin,\r\n_capillus_, a hair), are minute tubes having an average diameter of\r\n1/3000th of an inch. These permeate every part of the body. The\r\ncapillary arteries lead into the smallest veins, which unite to form\r\nlarger and larger veins, until what we may call the main streams are\r\nreached. Through these the blood flows to the heart.\r\n\r\nThere are three main points of difference between arteries and veins. In\r\nthe first place, the larger arteries have thick elastic walls, and\r\nmaintain their shape even when empty. This elasticity performs the\r\nfunction of the air-chamber of the force-pump. When the ventricles\r\ncontract, driving blood into the arteries, the walls of the latter\r\nexpand, and their contraction pushes the blood steadily forward without\r\nshock. The capillaries have very thin walls, so that fluids pass through\r\nthem to and from the body, feeding it and taking out waste matter. The\r\nveins are all thin-walled, and collapse when empty. Secondly, most veins\r\nare furnished with valves, which prevent blood flowing the wrong way.\r\nThese are similar in principle to those of the heart. Arteries have no\r\nvalves. Thirdly, arteries are generally deeply set, while many of the\r\nveins run near the surface of the body. Those on the front of the arm\r\nare specially visible. Place your thumb on them and run it along towards\r\nthe wrist, and you will notice that the veins distend owing to the\r\nclosing of the valves just mentioned.\r\n\r\nArterial blood is _red_, and comes out from a cut in gulps, on account\r\nof the contraction of the elastic walls. If you cut a vein, _blue_ blood\r\nissues in a steady stream. The change of colour is caused by the loss of\r\noxygen during the passage of the blood through the capillaries, and the\r\nabsorption of carbon dioxide from the tissues.\r\n\r\nThe _lungs_ are two of the great purifiers of the blood. As it\r\ncirculates through them, it gives up the carbon dioxide which it has\r\nabsorbed, and receives pure oxygen in exchange. If the air of a room is\r\n\"foul,\" the blood does not get the proper amount of oxygen. For this\r\nreason it is advisable for us to keep the windows of our rooms open as\r\nmuch as possible both day and night. Fatigue is caused by the\r\naccumulation of carbon dioxide and other impurities in the blood. When\r\nwe run, the heart pumps blood through the lungs faster than they can\r\npurify it, and eventually our muscles become poisoned to such an extent\r\nthat we have to stop from sheer exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COURSE OF THE BLOOD.\r\n\r\nIt takes rather less than a minute for a drop of blood to circulate from\r\nthe heart through the whole system and back to the heart.\r\n\r\nWe may briefly summarize the course of the circulation of the blood\r\nthus:--It is expelled from the left ventricle into the _aorta_ and the\r\nmain arteries, whence it passes into the smaller arteries, and thence\r\ninto the capillaries of the brain, stomach, kidneys, etc. It here\r\nimparts oxygen to the body, and takes in impurities. It then enters the\r\nveins, and through them flows back to the right auricle; is driven into\r\nthe right ventricle; is expelled into the _pulmonary_ (lung)\r\n_arteries_; enters the lungs, and is purified. It returns to the left\r\nauricle through the _pulmonary veins_; enters the left auricle, passes\r\nto left ventricle, and so on.\r\n\r\nA healthy heart beats from 120 times per minute in a one-year-old infant\r\nto 60 per minute in a very aged person. The normal rate for a\r\nmiddle-aged adult is from 80 to 70 beats.\r\n\r\nHeart disease signifies the failure of the heart valves to close\r\nproperly. Blood passes back when the heart contracts, and the\r\ncirculation is much enfeebled. By listening through a stethoscope the\r\ndoctor is able to tell whether the valves are in good order. A hissing\r\nsound during the beat indicates a leakage past the valves; a thump, or\r\n\"clack,\" that they shut completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYDRAULIC PRESS.\r\n\r\nIt is a characteristic of fluids and gases that if pressure be brought\r\nto bear on any part of a mass of either class of bodies it is\r\ntransmitted equally and undiminished in all directions, and acts with\r\nthe same force on all equal surfaces, at right angles to those surfaces.\r\nThe great natural philosopher Pascal first formulated this remarkable\r\nfact, of which a simple illustration is given in Fig. 179. Two\r\ncylinders, A and B, having a bore of one and two inches respectively,\r\nare connected by a pipe. Water is poured in, and pistons fitting the\r\ncylinders accurately and of equal weight are inserted. On piston B is\r\nplaced a load of 10 lbs. To prevent A rising above the level of B, it\r\nmust be loaded proportionately. The area of piston A is four times that\r\nof B, so that if we lay on it a 40-lb. weight, neither piston will move.\r\nThe walls of the cylinders and connecting pipe are also pressed outwards\r\nin the ratio of 10 lbs. for every part of their interior surface which\r\nhas an area equal to that of piston B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.--The cylinder and ram of a hydraulic press.]\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic press is an application of this law. Cylinder B is\r\nrepresented by a force pump of small bore, capable of delivering water\r\nat very high pressures (up to 10 tons per square inch). In the place of\r\nA we have a stout cylinder with a solid plunger, P (Fig. 180), carrying\r\nthe _table_ on which the object to be pressed is placed. Bramah, the\r\ninventor of the hydraulic press, experienced great difficulty in\r\npreventing the escape of water between the top of the cylinder and the\r\nplunger. If a \"gland\" packing of the type found in steam-cylinders were\r\nused, it failed to hold back the water unless it were screwed down so\r\ntightly as to jam the plunger. He tried all kinds of expedients without\r\nsuccess; and his invention, excellent though it was in principle, seemed\r\ndoomed to failure, when his foreman, Henry Maudslay,[35] solved the\r\nproblem in a simple but most masterly manner. He had a recess turned in\r\nthe neck of the cylinder at the point formerly occupied by the\r\nstuffing-box, and into this a leather collar of U-section (marked solid\r\nblack in Fig. 180) was placed with its open side downwards. When water\r\nreached it, it forced the edges apart, one against the plunger, the\r\nother against the walls of the recess, with a degree of tightness\r\nproportionate to the pressure. On water being released from the cylinder\r\nthe collar collapsed, allowing the plunger to sink without friction.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the hydraulic press is employed in lifts; in machines\r\nfor bending, drilling, and riveting steel plates, or forcing wheels on\r\nor off their axles; for advancing the \"boring shield\" of a tunnel; and\r\nfor other purposes too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD WATER-SUPPLY FITTINGS.\r\n\r\nAmong these, the most used is the tap, or cock. When a house is served\r\nby the town or district water supply, the fitting of proper taps on all\r\npipes connected with the supply is stipulated for by the water-works\r\nauthorities. The old-fashioned \"plug\" tap is unsuitable for controlling\r\nhigh-pressure water on account of the suddenness with which it checks\r\nthe flow. Lest the reader should have doubts as to the nature of a plug\r\ntap, we may add that it has a tapering cone of metal working in a\r\ntapering socket. On the cone being turned till a hole through it is\r\nbrought into line with the channel of the tap, water passes. A quarter\r\nturn closes the tap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.--A screw-down water cock.]\r\n\r\nIts place has been taken by the screw-down cock. A very common and\r\neffective pattern is shown in Fig. 181. The valve V, with a facing of\r\nrubber, leather, or some other sufficiently elastic substance, is\r\nattached to a pin, C, which projects upwards into the spindle A of the\r\ntap. This spindle has a screw thread on it engaging with a collar, B.\r\nWhen the spindle is turned it rises or falls, allowing the valve to\r\nleave its seating, V S, or forcing it down on to it. A packing P in the\r\nneck of B prevents the passage of water round the spindle. To open or\r\nclose the tap completely is a matter of several turns, which cannot be\r\nmade fast enough to produce a \"water-hammer\" in the pipes by suddenly\r\narresting the flow. The reader will easily understand that if water\r\nflowing at the rate of several miles an hour is abruptly checked, the\r\nshock to the pipes carrying it must be very severe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALL-COCK\r\n\r\nis used to feed a cistern automatically with water, and prevent the\r\nwater rising too far in the cistern (Fig. 182). Water enters the cistern\r\nthrough a valve, which is opened and closed by a plug faced with rubber.\r\nThe lower extremity of the plug is flattened, and has a rectangular hole\r\ncut in it. Through this passes a lever, L, attached at one end to a\r\nhollow copper sphere, and pivoted at the other on the valve casing. This\r\ncasing is not quite circular in section, for two slots are cast in the\r\ncircumference to allow water to pass round the plug freely when the\r\nvalve is open. The buoyancy of the copper sphere is sufficient to force\r\nthe plug's face up towards its seating as the valve rises, and to cut\r\noff the supply entirely when a certain level has been attained. If water\r\nis drawn off, the sphere sinks, the valve opens, and the loss is made\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.--An automatic ball-valve.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER-METER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.]\r\n\r\nSome consumers pay a sum quarterly for the privilege of a water supply,\r\nand the water company allows them to use as much as they require.\r\nOthers, however, prefer to pay a fixed amount for every thousand gallons\r\nused. In such cases, a water-meter is required to record the\r\nconsumption. We append a sectional diagram of Kennedy's patent\r\nwater-meter (Fig. 183), very widely used. At the bottom is the measuring\r\ncylinder, fitted with a piston, (6), which is made to move perfectly\r\nwater-tight and free from friction by means of a cylindrical ring of\r\nindia-rubber, rolling between the body of the piston and the internal\r\nsurface of the cylinder. The piston rod (25), after passing through a\r\nstuffing-box in the cylinder cover, is attached to a rack, (15), which\r\ngears with a cog, (13), fixed on a shaft. As the piston moves up and\r\ndown, this cog is turned first in one direction, then in the other. To\r\nthis shaft is connected the index mechanism (to the right). The cock-key\r\n(24) is so constructed that it can put either end of the measuring\r\ncylinder in communication with the supply or delivery pipes, if given a\r\nquarter turn (see Fig. 184). The weighted lever (14) moves loosely on\r\nthe pinion shaft through part of a circle. From the pinion project two\r\narms, one on each side of the lever. When the lever has been lifted by\r\none of these past the vertical position, it falls by its own weight on\r\nto a buffer-box rest, (18). In doing so, it strikes a projection on the\r\nduplex lever (19), which is joined to the cock-key, and gives the latter\r\na quarter turn.\r\n\r\nIn order to follow the working of the meter, we must keep an eye on\r\nFigs. 183 and 184 simultaneously. Water is entering from A, the supply\r\npipe. It flows through the cock downwards through channel D into the\r\nlower half of the cylinder. The piston rises, driving out the water\r\nabove it through C to the delivery pipe B. Just as the piston completes\r\nits stroke the weight, raised by the rack and pinion, topples over, and\r\nstrikes the key-arm, which it sends down till stopped by the\r\nbuffer-box. The tap is then at right angles to the position shown in\r\nFig. 184, and water is directed from A down C into the top of the\r\ncylinder, forcing the piston down, while the water admitted below during\r\nthe last stroke is forced up the passage D, and out by the outlet B.\r\nBefore the piston has arrived at the bottom of the cylinder, the lifter\r\nwill have lifted the weighted lever from the buffer-box, and raised it\r\nto a vertical position; from there it will have fallen on the right-hand\r\nkey-arm, and have brought the cock-key to its former position, ready to\r\nbegin another upward stroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.]\r\n\r\nThe _index mechanism_ makes allowance for the fact that the bevel-wheel\r\non the pinion shaft has its direction reversed at the beginning of every\r\nstroke of the piston. This bevel engages with two others mounted loosely\r\non the little shaft, on which is turned a screw thread to revolve the\r\nindex counter wheels. Each of these latter bevels actuates the shaft\r\nthrough a ratchet; but while one turns the shaft when rotating in a\r\nclockwise direction only, the other engages it when making an\r\nanti-clockwise revolution. The result is that the shaft is always turned\r\nin the same direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER-SUPPLY SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\nThe water for a town or a district supply is got either from wells or\r\nfrom a river. In the former case it may be assumed to be free from\r\nimpurities. In the latter, there is need for removing all the\r\nobjectionable and dangerous matter which river water always contains in\r\na greater or less degree. This purification is accomplished by first\r\nleading the water into large _settling tanks_, where the suspended\r\nmatter sinks to the bottom. The water is then drawn off into\r\n_filtration beds_, made in the following manner. The bottom is covered\r\nwith a thick layer of concrete. On this are laid parallel rows of\r\nbricks, the rows a small distance apart. Then come a layer of bricks or\r\ntiles placed close together; a layer of coarse gravel; a layer of finer\r\ngravel; and a thick layer of sand at the top. The sand arrests any solid\r\nmatter in the water as it percolates to the gravel and drains below.\r\nEven the microbes,[36] of microscopic size, are arrested as soon as the\r\nfilm of mud has formed on the top of the sand. Until this film is formed\r\nthe filter is not in its most efficient condition. Every now and then\r\nthe bed is drained, the surface mud and sand carefully drained off, and\r\nfresh sand put in their place. A good filter bed should not pass more\r\nthan from two to three gallons per hour for every square foot of\r\nsurface, and it must therefore have a large area.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes necessary to send the water through a succession of\r\nbeds, arranged in terraces, before it is sufficiently pure for drinking\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSEHOLD FILTER.\r\n\r\nWhen there is any doubt as to the wholesomeness of the water supply, a\r\nsmall filter is often used. The microbe-stopper is usually either\r\ncharcoal, sand, asbestos, or baked clay of some kind. In Fig. 185 we\r\ngive a section of a Maignen filter. R is the reservoir for the filtered\r\nwater; A the filter case proper; D a conical perforated frame; B a\r\njacket of asbestos cloth secured top and bottom by asbestos cords to D;\r\nC powdered carbon, between which and the asbestos is a layer of special\r\nchemical filtering medium. A perforated cap, E, covers in the carbon and\r\nprevents it being disturbed when water is poured in. The carbon arrests\r\nthe coarser forms of matter; the asbestos the finer. The asbestos jacket\r\nis easily removed and cleansed by heating over a fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.]\r\n\r\nThe most useful form of household filter is one which can be attached to\r\na tap connected with the main. Such a filter is usually made of\r\nporcelain or biscuit china. The Berkefeld filter has an outer case of\r\niron, and an interior hollow \"candle\" of porcelain from which a tube\r\npasses through the lid of the filter to a storage tank for the filtered\r\nwater. The water from the main enters the outer case, and percolates\r\nthrough the porcelain walls to the internal cavity and thence flows away\r\nthrough the delivery pipe.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the type of filter used it must be cleansed at proper\r\nintervals. A foul filter is very dangerous to those who drink the water\r\nfrom it. It has been proved by tests that, so far from purifying the\r\nwater, an inefficient and contaminated filter passes out water much more\r\nhighly charged with microbes than it was before it entered. We must not\r\ntherefore think that, because water has been filtered, it is necessarily\r\nsafe. The reverse is only too often the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS TRAPS.\r\n\r\nDangerous microbes can be breathed as well as drunk into the human\r\nsystem. Every communication between house and drains should be most\r\ncarefully \"trapped.\" The principle of a gas trap between, say, a kitchen\r\nsink and the drain to carry off the water is given in Fig. 186. Enough\r\nwater always remains in the bend to rise above the level of the elbow,\r\neffectually keeping back any gas that there may be in the pipe beyond\r\nthe bend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.--A trap for foul air.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER-ENGINES.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of the steam-engine human industries were largely\r\ndependent on the motive power of the wind and running water. But when\r\nthe infant nursed by Watt and Stephenson had grown into a giant, both of\r\nthese natural agents were deposed from the important position they once\r\nheld. Windmills in a state of decay crown many of our hilltops, and the\r\nwater-wheel which formerly brought wealth to the miller now rots in its\r\nmountings at the end of the dam. Except for pumping and moving boats and\r\nships, wind-power finds its occupation gone. It is too uncertain in\r\nquantity and quality to find a place in modern economics. Water-power,\r\non the other hand, has received a fresh lease of life through the\r\ninvention of machinery so scientifically designed as to use much more of\r\nthe water's energy than was possible with the old-fashioned wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.--A Pelton wheel which develops 5,000\r\nhorse-power. Observe the shape of the double buckets.]\r\n\r\nThe _turbine_, of which we have already spoken in our third chapter, is\r\nnow the favourite hydraulic engine. Some water-turbines work on much the\r\nsame principle as the Parsons steam-turbine; others resemble the De\r\nLaval. Among the latter the Pelton wheel takes the first place. By the\r\ncourtesy of the manufacturers we are able to give some interesting\r\ndetails and illustrations of this device.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.--Pelton wheel mounted, with nozzle in\r\nposition.]\r\n\r\nThe wheel, which may be of any diameter from six inches to ten feet, has\r\nbuckets set at regular intervals round the circumference, sticking\r\noutwards. Each bucket, as will be gathered from our illustration of an\r\nenormous 5,000 h.p. wheel (Fig. 187), is composed of two cups. A nozzle\r\nis so arranged as to direct water on the buckets just as they reach the\r\nlowest point of a revolution (see Fig. 188). The water strikes the\r\nbucket on the partition between the two cups, which turns it right and\r\nleft round the inside of the cups. The change of direction transfers the\r\nenergy of the water to the wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189.--Speed regulator for Pelton wheel.]\r\n\r\nThe speed of the wheel may be automatically regulated by a deflecting\r\nnozzle (Fig. 189), which has a ball and socket joint to permit of its\r\nbeing raised or lowered by a centrifugal governor, thus throwing the\r\nstream on or off the buckets. The power of the wheel is consequently\r\nincreased or diminished to meet the change of load, and a constant speed\r\nis maintained. When it is necessary to waste as little water as\r\npossible, a concentric tapered needle may be fitted inside the nozzle.\r\nWhen the nozzle is in its highest position the needle tip is withdrawn;\r\nas the nozzle sinks the needle protrudes, gradually decreasing the\r\ndischarge area of the nozzle.\r\n\r\nPelton wheels are designed to run at all speeds and to use water of any\r\npressure. At Manitou, Colorado, is an installation of three wheels\r\noperated by water which leaves the nozzle at the enormous pressure of\r\n935 lbs. per square inch. It is interesting to note that jets of very\r\nhigh-pressure water offer astonishing resistance to any attempt to\r\ndeflect their course. A three-inch jet of 500-lb. water cannot be cut\r\nthrough by a blow from a crowbar.\r\n\r\nIn order to get sufficient pressure for working hydraulic machinery in\r\nmines, factories, etc., water is often led for many miles in flumes, or\r\nartificial channels, along the sides of valleys from the source of\r\nsupply to the point at which it is to be used. By the time that point is\r\nreached the difference between the gradients of the flume and of the\r\nvalley bottom has produced a difference in height of some hundreds of\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190.--The Laxey water-wheel, Isle of Man. In the\r\ntop right-hand corner is a Pelton wheel of proportionate size required\r\nto do the same amount of work with the same consumption of water at the\r\nsame pressure.]\r\n\r\nThe full-page illustration on p. 380 affords a striking testimony to\r\nthe wonderful progress made in engineering practice during the last\r\nfifty years. The huge water-wheel which forms the bulk of the picture is\r\nthat at Laxey, in the Isle of Man. It is 72-1/2 feet in diameter, and is\r\nsupposed to develop 150 horse-power, which is transmitted several\r\nhundreds of feet by means of wooden rods supported at regular intervals.\r\nThe power thus transmitted operates a system of pumps in a lead mine,\r\nraising 250 gallons of water per minute, to an elevation of 1,200 feet.\r\nThe driving water is brought some distance to the wheel in an\r\nunderground conduit, and is carried up the masonry tower by pressure,\r\nflowing over the top into the buckets on the circumference of the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe little cut in the upper corner represents a Pelton wheel drawn on\r\nthe same scale, which, given an equal supply of water at the same\r\npressure, would develop the same power as the Laxey monster. By the side\r\nof the giant the other appears a mere toy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CREAM SEPARATOR.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Denmark went to war with Germany, and emerged from the short\r\nstruggle shorn of the provinces of Lauenburg, Holstein, and Schleswig.\r\nThe loss of the two last, the fairest and most fertile districts of the\r\nkingdom, was indeed grievous. The Danish king now ruled only over a land\r\nconsisting largely of moor, marsh, and dunes, apparently worthless for\r\nany purpose. But the Danes, with admirable courage, entered upon a\r\nsecond struggle, this time with nature. They made roads and railways,\r\ndug irrigation ditches, and planted forest trees; and so gradually\r\nturned large tracts of what had been useless country into valuable\r\npossessions. Agriculture being much depressed, owing to the low price of\r\ncorn, they next gave their attention to the improvement of dairy\r\nfarming. Labour-saving machinery of all kinds was introduced, none more\r\nimportant than the device for separating the fatty from the watery\r\nconstituents of milk. It would not be too much to say that the separator\r\nis largely responsible for the present prosperity of Denmark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.--Section of a Cream Separator.]\r\n\r\nHow does it work? asks the reader. Centrifugal force[37] is the\r\ngoverning principle. To explain its application we append a sectional\r\nillustration (Fig. 191) of Messrs. Burmeister and Wain's hand-power\r\nseparator, which may be taken as generally representative of this class\r\nof machines. Inside a circular casing is a cylindrical bowl, D, mounted\r\non a shaft which can be revolved 5,000 times a minute by means of the\r\ncog-wheels and the screw thread chased on it near the bottom extremity.\r\nMilk flows from the reservoir R (supported on a stout arm) through tap A\r\ninto a little distributer on the top of the separator, and from it drops\r\ninto the central tube C of the bowl. Falling to the bottom, it is flung\r\noutwards by centrifugal force, finds an escape upwards through the holes\r\n_a a_, and climbs up the perforated grid _e_, the surface of which is a\r\nseries of pyramidical excrescences, and finally reaches the inner\r\nsurface of the drum proper. The velocity of rotation is so tremendous\r\nthat the heavier portions of the milk--that is, the watery--crowd\r\ntowards the point furthest from the centre, and keep the lighter fatty\r\nelements away from contact with the sides of the drum. In the diagram\r\nthe water is represented by small circles, the cream by small crosses.\r\n\r\nAs more milk enters the drum it forces upwards what is already there.\r\nThe cap of the drum has an inner jacket, F, which at the bottom _all but\r\ntouches_ the side of the drum. The distance between them is the merest\r\nslit; but the cream is deflected up outside F into space E, and escapes\r\nthrough a hole one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter perforating the\r\nplate G. The cream is flung into space K and trickles out of spout B,\r\nwhile the water flies into space H and trickles away through spout A.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"HYDRO.,\"\r\n\r\nused in laundries for wringing clothes by centrifugal force, has a solid\r\nouter casing and an inner perforated cylindrical cage, revolved at high\r\nspeed by a vertical shaft. The wet clothes are placed in the cage, and\r\nthe machine is started. The water escapes through the perforations and\r\nruns down the side of the casing to a drain. After a few minutes the\r\nclothes are dry enough for ironing. So great is the centrifugal force\r\nthat they are consolidated against the sides of the cage, and care is\r\nneeded in their removal.\r\n\r\n[35] Inventor of the lathe slide-rest.\r\n\r\n[36] Living germs; some varieties the cause of disease.\r\n\r\n[37] That is, centre-fleeing force.

The two\r\nsystems of storing and distributing the heated water most commonly used\r\nare--(1) The _tank_ system; (2) the _cylinder_ system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TANK SYSTEM\r\n\r\nis shown diagrammatically in Fig. 192. The boiler is situated at the\r\nback of the range, and when a \"damper\" is drawn the fire and hot gases\r\npass under it to a flue leading to the chimney. The almost boiling water\r\nrises to the top of the boiler and thence finds its way up the _flow\r\npipe_ into the hot-water tank A, displacing the somewhat colder water\r\nthere, which descends through the _return pipe_ to the bottom of the\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nWater is drawn off from the flow pipe. This pipe projects some distance\r\nthrough the bottom of A, so that the hottest portion of the contents may\r\nbe drawn off first. A tank situated in the roof, and fed from the main\r\nby a ball-cock valve, communicates with A through the siphon pipe S. The\r\nbend in this pipe prevents the ascent of hot water, which cannot sink\r\nthrough water colder than itself. From the top of A an _expansion pipe_\r\nis led up and turned over the cold-water tank to discharge any steam\r\nwhich may be generated in the boiler.\r\n\r\nA hot-water radiator for warming the house may be connected to the flow\r\nand return pipes as shown. Since it opens a \"short circuit\" for the\r\ncirculation, the water in the tank above will not be so well heated\r\nwhile it is in action. If cocks are fitted to the radiator pipes, the\r\namount of heat thus deflected can be governed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.--The \"tank\" system of hot-water supply.]\r\n\r\nA disadvantage of the tank system is that the tank, if placed high\r\nenough to supply all flows, is sometimes so far from the boiler that the\r\nwater loses much of its heat in the course of circulation. Also, if for\r\nany reason the cold water fails, tank A may be entirely emptied,\r\ncirculation cease, and the water in the boiler and pipes boil away\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CYLINDER SYSTEM\r\n\r\n(Fig. 193) is open to neither of these objections. Instead of a\r\nrectangular tank up aloft, we now have a large copper cylinder situated\r\nin the kitchen near the range. The flow and return pipes are continuous,\r\nand the cold supply enters the bottom of the cylinder through a pipe\r\nwith a siphon bend in it. As before, water is drawn off from the flow\r\npipe, and a radiator may be put in the circuit. Since there is no\r\ndraw-off point below the top of the cylinder, even if the cold supply\r\nfails the cylinder will remain full, and the failure will be discovered\r\nlong before there is any danger of the water in it boiling away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.--The \"cylinder\" system of hot-water supply.]\r\n\r\nBoiler explosions are due to obstructions in the pipes. If the\r\nexpansion pipe and the cold-water supply pipe freeze, there is danger of\r\na slight accumulation of steam; and if one of the circulation pipes is\r\nalso blocked, steam must generate until \"something has to go,\"[38] which\r\nis naturally the boiler. Assuming that the pipes are quite full to the\r\npoints of obstruction, the fracture would result from the expansion of\r\nthe water. Steam cannot generate unless there be a space above the\r\nwater. But the expanding water has stored up the heat which would have\r\nraised steam, and the moment expansion begins after fracture this energy\r\nis suddenly let loose. Steam forms instantaneously, augmenting the\r\neffects of the explosion. From this it will be gathered that all pipes\r\nshould be properly protected against frost; especially near the roof.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of disaster is the _furring up_ of the pipes with the lime\r\ndeposited by hard water when heated. When hard water is used, the pipes\r\nwill sooner or later be blocked near the boiler; and as the deposit is\r\ntoo hard to be scraped away, periodical renewals are unavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW A LAMP WORKS.\r\n\r\nFrom heating we turn to lighting, and first to the ordinary paraffin\r\nlamp. The two chief things to notice about this are the wick and the\r\nchimney. The wick, being made of closely-woven cotton, draws up the oil\r\nby what is known as _capillary attraction_. If you dip the ends of two\r\nglass tubes, one half an inch, the other one-eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, into a vessel of water, you will notice that the water rises\r\nhigher in the smaller tube. Or get two clean glass plates and lay them\r\nface to face, touching at one end, but kept slightly apart at the other\r\nby some small object. If they are partly submerged perpendicularly, the\r\nwater will rise between the plates--furthest on the side at which the\r\ntwo plates touch, and less and less as the other edge is approached. The\r\ntendency of liquids to rise through porous bodies is a phenomenon for\r\nwhich we cannot account.\r\n\r\nMineral oil contains a large proportion of carbon and hydrogen; it is\r\ntherefore termed hydro-carbon. When oil reaches the top of a lighted\r\nwick, the liquid is heated until it turns into gas. The carbon and\r\nhydrogen unite with the oxygen of the air. Some particles of the carbon\r\napparently do not combine at once, and as they pass through the fiery\r\nzone of the flame are heated to such a temperature as to become highly\r\nluminous. It is to produce these light-rays that we use a lamp, and to\r\nburn our oil efficiently we must supply the flame with plenty of oxygen,\r\nwith more than it could naturally obtain. So we surround it with a\r\ntransparent chimney of special glass. The air inside the chimney is\r\nheated, and rises; fresh air rushes in at the bottom, and is also heated\r\nand replaced. As the air passes through, the flame seizes on the oxygen.\r\nIf the wick is turned up until the flame becomes smoky and flares, the\r\npoint has been passed at which the induced chimney draught can supply\r\nsufficient oxygen to combine with the carbon of the vapour, and the\r\n\"free\" carbon escapes as smoke.\r\n\r\nThe blower-plate used to draw up a fire (Fig. 194) performs exactly the\r\nsame function as the lamp chimney, but on a larger scale. The plate\r\nprevents air passing straight up the chimney over the coals, and compels\r\nit to find a way through the fire itself to replace the heated air\r\nrising up the chimney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194.--Showing how a blower-plate draws up the\r\nfire.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS AND GASWORKS.\r\n\r\nA lamp is an apparatus for converting hydro-carbon mineral oil into gas\r\nand burning it efficiently. The gas-jet burns gases produced by driving\r\noff hydro-carbon vapours from coal in apparatus specially designed for\r\nthe purpose. Gas-making is now, in spite of the competition of electric\r\nlighting, so important an industry that we shall do well to glance at\r\nthe processes which it includes. Coal gas may be produced on a very\r\nsmall scale as follows:--Fill a tin canister (the joints of which have\r\nbeen made by folding the metal, not by soldering) with coal, clap on the\r\nlid, and place it, lid downwards, in a bright fire, after punching a\r\nhole in the bottom. Vapour soon begins to issue from the hole. This is\r\nprobably at first only steam, due to the coal being more or less damp.\r\nBut if a lighted match be presently applied the vapour takes fire,\r\nshowing that coal gas proper is coming off. The flame lasts for a long\r\ntime. When it dies the canister may be removed and the contents\r\nexamined. Most of the carbon remains in the form of _coke_. It is bulk\r\nfor bulk much lighter than coal, for the hydrogen, oxygen, and other\r\ngases, and some of the carbon have been driven off by the heat. The coke\r\nitself burns if placed in a fire, but without any smoke, such as issues\r\nfrom coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195.--Sketch of the apparatus used in the\r\nmanufacture of coal gas.]\r\n\r\nOur home-made gas yields a smoky and unsatisfactory flame, owing to the\r\npresence of certain impurities--ammonia, tar, sulphuretted hydrogen, and\r\ncarbon bisulphide. A gas factory must be equipped with means of getting\r\nrid of these objectionable constituents. Turning to Fig. 195, which\r\ndisplays very diagrammatically the main features of a gas plant, we\r\nobserve at the extreme right the _retorts_, which correspond to our\r\ncanister. These are usually long fire-brick tubes of D-section, the flat\r\nside at the bottom. Under each is a furnace, the flames of which play on\r\nthe bottom, sides, and inner end of the retort. The outer end projecting\r\nbeyond the brickwork seating has an iron air-tight door for filling the\r\nretort through, immediately behind which rises an iron exit pipe, A, for\r\nthe gases. Tar, which vaporizes at high temperatures, but liquefies at\r\nordinary atmospheric heat, must first be got rid of. This is effected by\r\npassing the gas through the _hydraulic main_, a tubular vessel half full\r\nof water running the whole length of the retorts. The end of pipe A\r\ndips below the surface of the water, which condenses most of the tar and\r\nsteam. The partly-purified gas now passes through pipe B to the\r\n_condensers_, a series of inverted U-pipes standing on an iron chest\r\nwith vertical cross divisions between the mouths of each U. These\r\ndivisions dip into water, so that the gas has to pass up one leg of a U,\r\ndown the other, up the first leg of the second pipe, and so on, till all\r\ntraces of the tar and other liquid constituents have condensed on the\r\ninside of the pipe, from which they drop into the tank below.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is the passage of the _scrubber_, filled with coke over\r\nwhich water perpetually flows. The ammonia gas is here absorbed. There\r\nstill remain the sulphuretted hydrogen and the carbon bisulphide, both\r\nof which are extremely offensive to the nostrils. Slaked lime, laid on\r\ntrays in an air-tight compartment called the _lime purifier_, absorbs\r\nmost of the sulphurous elements of these; and the coal gas is then fit\r\nfor use. On leaving the purifiers it flows into the _gasometer_, or\r\ngasholder, the huge cake-like form of which is a very familiar object in\r\nthe environs of towns. The gasometer is a cylindrical box with a domed\r\ntop, but no bottom, built of riveted steel plates. It stands in a\r\ncircular tank of water, so that it may rise and fall without any escape\r\nof gas. The levity of the gas, in conjunction with weights attached to\r\nthe ends of chains working over pulleys on the framework surrounding the\r\nholder, suffices to raise the holder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196.--The largest gasholder in the world: South\r\nMetropolitan Gas Co., Greenwich Gas Works. Capacity, 12,158,600 cubic\r\nfeet.]\r\n\r\nSome gasometers have an enormous capacity. The record is at present\r\nheld by that built for the South Metropolitan Gas Co., London, by\r\nMessrs. Clayton & Son of Leeds. This monster (of which we append an\r\nillustration, Fig. 196) is 300 feet in diameter and 180 feet high. When\r\nfully extended it holds 12,158,600 cubic feet of gas. Owing to its\r\nimmense size, it is built on the telescopic principle in six \"lifts,\" of\r\n30 feet deep each. The sides of each lift, or ring, except the topmost,\r\nhave a section shaped somewhat like the letter N. Two of the members\r\nform a deep, narrow cup to hold water, in which the \"dip\" member of the\r\nring above it rises and falls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197.--Drawing retorts. (_Photo by F. Marsh._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC STOKING.\r\n\r\nThe labour of feeding the retorts with coal and removing the coke is\r\nexceedingly severe. In the illustration on p. 400 (made from a very fine\r\nphotograph taken by Mr. F. Marsh of Clifton) we see a man engaged in\r\n\"drawing\" the retorts through the iron doors at their outer ends.\r\nAutomatic machinery is now used in large gasworks for both operations.\r\nOne of the most ingenious stokers is the De Brouwer, shown at work in\r\nFig. 198. The machine is suspended from an overhead trolley running on\r\nrails along the face of the retorts. Coal falls into a funnel at the top\r\nof the telescopic pipe P from hoppers in the story above, which have\r\nopenings, H H, controlled by shutters. The coal as it falls is caught by\r\na rubber belt working round part of the circumference of the large\r\nwheel W and a number of pulleys, and is shot into the mouth of the\r\nretort. The operator is seen pulling the handle which opens the shutter\r\nof the hopper above the feed-tube, and switching on the 4 h.p. electric\r\nmotor which drives the belt and moves the machine about. One of these\r\nfeeders will charge a retort 20 feet long in twenty-two seconds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.--De Brouwer automatic retort charger.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA GAS GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\nSome readers may have noticed that late at night a gas-jet, which a few\r\nhours before burned with a somewhat feeble flame when the tap was turned\r\nfully on, now becomes more and more vigorous, and finally may flare up\r\nwith a hissing sound. This is because many of the burners fed by the\r\nmain supplying the house have been turned off, and consequently there is\r\na greater amount of gas available for the jets still burning, which\r\ntherefore feel an increased pressure. As a matter of fact, the pressure\r\nof gas in the main is constantly varying, owing partly to the\r\nirregularity of the delivery from the gasometer, and partly to the fact\r\nthat the number of burners in action is not the same for many minutes\r\ntogether. It must also be remembered that houses near the gasometer end\r\nof the main will receive their gas at a higher pressure than those at\r\nthe other end. The gas stored in the holders may be wanted for use in\r\nthe street lamps a few yards away, or for other lamps several miles\r\ndistant. It is therefore evident that if there be just enough pressure\r\nto give a good supply to the nearest lamp, there will be too little a\r\nshort distance beyond it, and none at all at the extreme point; so that\r\nit is necessary to put on enough pressure to overcome the friction on\r\nall these miles of pipe, and give just enough gas at the extreme end. It\r\nfollows that at all intermediate points the pressure is excessive. Gas\r\nof the average quality is burned to the greatest advantage, as regards\r\nits light-giving properties, when its pressure is equal to that of a\r\ncolumn of water half an inch high, or about 1/50 lb. to the square inch.\r\nWith less it gives a smoky, flickering light, and with more the\r\ncombustion is also imperfect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199.]\r\n\r\nEvery house supply should therefore be fitted with a gas governor, to\r\nkeep the pressure constant. A governor frequently used, the Stott, is\r\nshown in section in Fig. 199. Gas enters from the main on the right, and\r\npasses into a circular elbow, D, which has top and bottom apertures\r\nclosed by the valves V V. Attached to the valve shaft is a large\r\ninverted cup of metal, the tip of which is immersed in mercury. The\r\npressure at which the governor is to act is determined by the weights W,\r\nwith which the valve spindle is loaded at the top. As soon as this\r\npressure is exceeded, the gas in C C lifts the metal cup, and V V are\r\npressed against their seats, so cutting off the supply. Gas cannot\r\nescape from C C, as it has not sufficient pressure to force its way\r\nthrough the mercury under the lip of the cup. Immediately the pressure\r\nin C C falls, owing to some of the gas being used up, the valves open\r\nand admit more gas. When the fluctuations of pressure are slight, the\r\nvalves never close completely, but merely throttle the supply until the\r\npressure beyond them falls to its proper level--that is, they pass just\r\nas much gas as the burners in use can consume at the pressure arranged\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nGovernors of much larger size, but working on much the same principle,\r\nare fitted to the mains at the point where they leave the gasometers.\r\nThey are not, however, sensitive to local fluctuations in the pipes,\r\nhence the necessity for separate governors in the house between the\r\nmeter and the burners.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAS-METER\r\n\r\ncommonly used in houses acts on the principle shown in Fig. 200. The\r\nair-tight casing is divided by horizontal and vertical divisions into\r\nthree gas-chambers, B, C, and D. Gas enters at A, and passes to the\r\nvalve chamber B. The slide-valves of this allow it to pass into C and D,\r\nand also into the two circular leather bellows E, F, which are attached\r\nto the central division G, but are quite independent of one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 200.--Sketch of the bellows and chambers of a \"dry\"\r\ngas meter.]\r\n\r\nWe will suppose that in the illustration the valves are admitting gas to\r\nchamber C and bellows F. The pressure in C presses the circular head of\r\nE towards the division G, expelling the contents of the bellows through\r\nan outlet pipe (not shown) to the burners in operation within the house.\r\nSimultaneously the inflation of F forces the gas in chamber D also\r\nthrough the outlet. The head-plates of the bellows are attached to rods\r\nand levers (not shown) working the slide-valves in B. As soon as E is\r\nfully in, and F fully expanded, the valves begin to open and put the\r\ninlet pipe in communication with D and E, and allow the contents of F\r\nand C to escape to the outlet. The movements of the valve mechanism\r\noperate a train of counting wheels, visible through a glass window in\r\nthe side of the case. As the bellows have a definite capacity, every\r\nstroke that they give means that a certain volume of gas has been\r\nejected either from them or from the chambers in which they move: this\r\nis registered by the counter. The apparatus practically has two\r\ndouble-action cylinders (of which the bellows ends are the pistons)\r\nworking on the same principle as the steam-cylinder (Fig. 21). The\r\nvalves have three ports--the central, or exhaust, leading to the outlet,\r\nthe outer ones from the inlet. The bellows are fed through channels in\r\nthe division G.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCANDESCENT GAS LIGHTING.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the electric arc lamp and the incandescent glow-lamp\r\nseemed at one time to spell the doom of gas as an illuminating agent.\r\nBut the appearance in 1886 of the Welsbach _incandescent mantle_ for\r\ngas-burners opened a prosperous era in the history of gas lighting.\r\n\r\nThe luminosity of a gas flame depends on the number of carbon particles\r\nliberated within it, and the temperature to which these particles can be\r\nheated as they pass through the intensely hot outside zone of the flame.\r\nBy enriching the gas in carbon more light is yielded, up to a certain\r\npoint, with a flame of a given temperature. To increase the heat of the\r\nflame various devices were tried before the introduction of the\r\nincandescent mantle, but they were found to be too short-lived to have\r\nany commercial value. Inventors therefore sought for methods by which\r\nthe emission of light could be obtained from coal gas independently of\r\nthe incandescence of the carbon particles in the flame itself; and step\r\nby step it was discovered that gas could be better employed merely as a\r\nheating agent, to raise to incandescence substances having a higher\r\nemissivity of light than carbon.\r\n\r\nDr. Auer von Welsbach found that the substances most suitable for\r\nincandescent mantles were the oxides of certain rare metals, _thorium_,\r\nand _cerium_. The mantle is made by dipping a cylinder of cotton net\r\ninto a solution of nitrate of thorium and cerium, containing 99 per\r\ncent. of the former and 1 per cent. of the latter metal. When the fibres\r\nare sufficiently soaked, the mantle is withdrawn, squeezed, and placed\r\non a mould to dry. It is next held over a Bunsen gas flame and the\r\ncotton is burned away, while the nitrates are converted into oxides. The\r\nmantle is now ready for use, but very brittle. So it has to undergo a\r\nfurther dipping, in a solution of gun-cotton and alcohol, to render it\r\ntough enough for packing. When it is required for use, it is suspended\r\nover the burner by an asbestos thread woven across the top, a light is\r\napplied to the bottom, and the collodion burned off, leaving nothing but\r\nthe heat-resisting oxides.\r\n\r\nThe burner used with a mantle is constructed on the Bunsen principle.\r\nThe gas is mixed, as it emerges from the jet, with sufficient air to\r\nrender its combustion perfect. All the carbon is burned, and the flame,\r\nthough almost invisible, is intensely hot. The mantle oxides convert the\r\nheat energy of the flame into light energy. This is proved not only by\r\nthe intense whiteness of the mantle, but by the fact that the heat\r\nissuing from the chimney of the burner is not nearly so great when the\r\nmantle is in position as when it is absent.\r\n\r\nThe incandescent mantle is more extensively used every year. In Germany\r\n90 per cent. of gas lighting is on the incandescent system, and in\r\nEngland about 40 per cent. We may notice, as an interesting example of\r\nthe fluctuating fortunes of invention, that the once doomed gas-burner\r\nhas, thanks to Welsbach's mantle, in many instances replaced the\r\nincandescent electric lamps that were to doom it.\r\n\r\n[38] If, of course, there is no safety-valve in proper working order\r\nincluded in the installation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS MECHANISMS.\r\n\r\n     CLOCKS AND WATCHES:--A short history of timepieces--The\r\n     construction of timepieces--The driving power--The\r\n     escapement--Compensating pendulums--The spring balance--The\r\n     cylinder escapement--The lever escapement--Compensated\r\n     balance-wheels--Keyless winding mechanism for watches--The hour\r\n     hand train.

That of Ahaz\r\nmentioned in the Second Book of Kings is the earliest dial of which we\r\nhave record. The obelisks of the Egyptians and the curious stone pillars\r\nof the Druidic age also probably served as shadow-casters.\r\n\r\nThe clepsydra, or water-clock, also of great antiquity, was the first\r\ncontrivance for gauging the passage of the hours independently of the\r\nmotion of the earth. In its simplest form it was a measure into which\r\nwater fell drop by drop, hour levels being marked on the inside.\r\nSubsequently a very simple mechanism was added to drive a pointer--a\r\nfloat carrying a vertical rack, engaging with a cog on the pointer\r\nspindle; or a string from the float passed over a pulley attached to the\r\npointer and rotated it as the float rose, after the manner of the wheel\r\nbarometer (Fig. 153). In 807 A.D. Charlemagne received from the King of\r\nPersia a water-clock which struck the hours. It is thus described in\r\nGifford's \"History of France\":--\"The dial was composed of twelve small\r\ndoors, which represented the division of the hours. Each door opened at\r\nthe hour it was intended to represent, and out of it came a small number\r\nof little balls, which fell one by one, at equal distances of time, on a\r\nbrass drum. It might be told by the eye what hour it was by the number\r\nof doors that were open, and by the ear by the number of balls that\r\nfell. When it was twelve o'clock twelve horsemen in miniature issued\r\nforth at the same time and shut all the doors.\"\r\n\r\nSand-glasses were introduced about 330 A.D. Except for special\r\npurposes, such as timing sermons and boiling eggs, they have not been of\r\nany practical value.\r\n\r\nThe clepsydra naturally suggested to the mechanical mind the idea of\r\ndriving a mechanism for registering time by the force of gravity acting\r\non some body other than water. The invention of the _weight-driven\r\nclock_ is attributed, like a good many other things, to Archimedes, the\r\nfamous Sicilian mathematician of the third century B.C.; but no record\r\nexists of any actual clock composed of wheels operated by a weight prior\r\nto 1120 A.D. So we may take that year as opening the era of the clock as\r\nwe know it.\r\n\r\nAbout 1500 Peter Hele of Nuremberg invented the _mainspring_ as a\r\nsubstitute for the weight, and the _watch_ appeared soon afterwards\r\n(1525 A.D.). The pendulum was first adopted for controlling the motion\r\nof the wheels by Christian Huygens, a distinguished Dutch mechanician,\r\nin 1659.\r\n\r\nTo Thomas Tompion, \"the father of English watchmaking,\" is ascribed the\r\nhonour of first fitting a _hairspring_ to the escapement of a watch, in\r\nor about the year 1660. He also introduced the _cylinder escapement_ now\r\nso commonly used in cheap watches. Though many improvements have been\r\nmade since his time, Tompion manufactured clocks and watches which were\r\nexcellent timekeepers, and as a reward for the benefits conferred on his\r\nfellows during his lifetime, he was, after death, granted the\r\nexceptional honour of a resting-place in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTRUCTION OF TIMEPIECES.\r\n\r\nA clock or watch contains three main elements:--(1) The source of power,\r\nwhich may be a weight or a spring; (2) the train of wheels operated by\r\nthe driving force; (3) the agent for controlling the movements of the\r\ntrain--this in large clocks is usually a pendulum, in small clocks and\r\nwatches a hairspring balance. To these may be added, in the case of\r\nclocks, the apparatus for striking the hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRIVING POWER.\r\n\r\n_Weights_ are used only in large clocks, such as one finds in halls,\r\ntowers, and observatories. The great advantage of employing weights is\r\nthat a constant driving power is exerted. _Springs_ occupy much less\r\nroom than weights, and are indispensable for portable timepieces. The\r\nemployment of them caused trouble to early experimenters on account of\r\nthe decrease in power which necessarily accompanies the uncoiling of a\r\nwound-up spring. Jacob Zech of Prague overcame the difficulty in 1525 by\r\nthe invention of the _fusee_, a kind of conical pulley interposed\r\nbetween the barrel, or circular drum containing the mainspring, and the\r\ntrain of wheels which the spring has to drive. The principle of the\r\n\"drum and fusee\" action will be understood from Fig. 201. The mainspring\r\nis a long steel ribbon fixed at one end to an arbor (the watchmaker's\r\nname for a spindle or axle), round which it is tightly wound. The arbor\r\nand spring are inserted in the barrel. The arbor is prevented from\r\nturning by a ratchet, B, and click, and therefore the spring in its\r\neffort to uncoil causes the barrel to rotate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.]\r\n\r\nA string of catgut (or a very fine chain) is connected at one end to\r\nthe circumference of the drum, and wound round it, the other end being\r\nfixed to the larger end of the fusee, which is attached to the\r\ndriving-wheel of the watch or clock by the intervention of a ratchet and\r\nclick (not shown). To wind the spring the fusee is turned backward by\r\nmeans of a key applied to the square end A of the fusee arbor, and this\r\ndraws the string from off the drum on to the fusee. The force of the\r\nspring causes the fusee to rotate by pulling the string off it, coil by\r\ncoil, and so drives the train of wheels. But while the mainspring, when\r\nfully wound, turns the fusee by uncoiling the string from the smallest\r\npart of the fusee, it gets the advantage of the larger radius as its\r\nenergy becomes lessened.\r\n\r\nThe fusee is still used for marine chronometers, for some clocks that\r\nhave a mainspring and pendulum, and occasionally for watches. In the\r\nlatter it has been rendered unnecessary by the introduction of the\r\n_going-barrel_ by Swiss watchmakers, who formed teeth on the edge of the\r\nmainspring barrel to drive the train of wheels. This kind of drum is\r\ncalled \"going\" because it drives the watch during the operation of\r\nwinding, which is performed by rotating the drum arbor to which the\r\ninner end of the spring is attached. A ratchet prevents the arbor from\r\nbeing turned backwards by the spring. The adoption of the going-barrel\r\nhas been made satisfactory by the improvements in the various escapement\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPEMENT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.]\r\n\r\nThe spring or weight transmits its power through a train of cogs to the\r\n_escapement_, or device for regulating the rate at which the wheels are\r\nto revolve. In clocks a _pendulum_ is generally used as the controlling\r\nagent. Galileo, when a student at Pisa, noticed that certain hanging\r\nlamps in the cathedral there swung on their cords at an equal rate; and\r\non investigation he discovered the principle that the shorter a pendulum\r\nis the more quickly will it swing to and fro. As has already been\r\nobserved, Huygens first applied the principle to the governing of\r\nclocks. In Fig. 202 we have a simple representation of the \"dead-beat\"\r\nescapement commonly used in clocks. The escape-wheel is mounted on the\r\nshaft of the last cog of the driving train, the pallet on a spindle\r\nfrom which depends a split arm embracing the rod and the pendulum. We\r\nmust be careful to note that the pendulum _controls_ motion only; it\r\ndoes not cause movement.\r\n\r\nThe escape-wheel revolves in a clockwise direction. The two pallets _a_\r\nand _b_ are so designed that only one can rest on the teeth at one time.\r\nIn the sketch the sloping end of _b_ has just been forced upwards by the\r\npressure of a tooth. This swings the pallet and the pendulum. The\r\nmomentum of the latter causes _a_ to descend, and at the instant when\r\n_b_ clears its tooth _a_ catches and holds another. The left-hand side\r\nof _a_, called the _locking-face_, is part of a circle, so that the\r\nescape-wheel is held motionless as long as it touches _a_: hence the\r\nterm, \"dead beat\"--that is, brought to a dead stop. As the pendulum\r\nswings back, to the left, under the influence of gravity, _a_ is raised\r\nand frees the tooth. The wheel jerks round, and another tooth is caught\r\nby the locking-face of _b_. Again the pendulum swings to the right, and\r\nthe sloping end of _b_ is pushed up once more, giving the pendulum fresh\r\nimpetus. This process repeats itself as long as the driving power\r\nlasts--for weeks, months, or years, as the case may be, and the\r\nmechanism continues to be in good working order.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATING PENDULUMS.\r\n\r\nMetal expands when heated; therefore a steel pendulum which is of the\r\nexact length to govern a clock correctly at a temperature of 60° would\r\nbecome too long at 80°, and slow the clock, and too short at 40°, and\r\ncause it to gain. In common clocks the pendulum rod is often made of\r\nwood, which maintains an almost constant length at all ordinary\r\ntemperatures. But for very accurate clocks something more efficient is\r\nrequired. Graham, the partner of Thomas Tompion, took advantage of the\r\nfact that different kinds of metal have different ratios of expansion to\r\nproduce a _self-compensating_ pendulum on the principle illustrated by\r\nFig. 203. He used steel for the rod, and formed the _bob_, or weighted\r\nend, of a glass jar containing mercury held in a stirrup; the mercury\r\nbeing of such a height that, as the pendulum rod lengthened with a rise\r\nof temperature, the mercury expanded _upwards_ sufficiently to keep the\r\ndistance between the point of suspension and the centre of gravity of\r\nthe bob always the same. With a fall of temperature the rod shortened,\r\nwhile the mercury sank in the jar. This device has not been improved\r\nupon, and is still used in observatories and other places where\r\ntimekeepers of extreme precision are required. The milled nut S in Fig.\r\n203 is fitted at the end of the pendulum rod to permit the exact\r\nadjustment of the pendulum's length.\r\n\r\nFor watches, chronometers, and small clocks\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPRING BALANCE\r\n\r\ntakes the place of the pendulum. We still have an escape-wheel with\r\nteeth of a suitable shape to give impulses to the controlling agent.\r\nThere are two forms of spring escapement, but as both employ a\r\nhairspring and balance-wheel we will glance at these before going\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203.]\r\n\r\nThe _hairspring_ is made of very fine steel ribbon, tempered to extreme\r\nelasticity, and shaped to a spiral. The inner end is attached to the\r\narbor of the _balance-wheel_, the outer end to a stud projecting from\r\nthe plate of the watch. When the balance-wheel, impelled by the\r\nescapement, rotates, it winds up the spring. The energy thus stored\r\nhelps the wheel to revolve the other way during the locking of a tooth\r\nof the escape-wheel. The time occupied by the winding and the unwinding\r\ndepends upon the length of the spring. The strength of the impulse makes\r\nno difference. A strong impulse causes the spring to coil itself up more\r\nthan a weak impulse would; but inasmuch as more energy is stored the\r\nprocess of unwinding is hastened. To put the matter very simply--a\r\nstrong impulse moves the balance-wheel further, but rotates it quickly;\r\na weak impulse moves it a shorter distance, but rotates it slowly. In\r\nfact, the principle of the pendulum is also that of the hairspring; and\r\nthe duration of a vibration depends on the length of the rod in the one\r\ncase, and of the spring in the other.\r\n\r\nMotion is transmitted to the balance by one of two methods. Either (1)\r\ndirectly, by a cylinder escapement; or (2) indirectly, through a lever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204.--\"Cylinder\" watch escapement.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CYLINDER ESCAPEMENT\r\n\r\nis seen in Fig. 204. The escape-wheel has sharp teeth set on stalks.\r\n(One tooth is removed to show the stalk.) The balance-wheel is mounted\r\non a small steel cylinder, with part of the circumference cut away at\r\nthe level of the teeth, so that if seen from above it would appear like\r\n_a_ in our illustration. A tooth is just beginning to shove its point\r\nunder the nearer edge of the opening. As it is forced forwards, _b_ is\r\nrevolved in a clockwise direction, winding up the hairspring. When the\r\ntooth has passed the nearer edge it flies forward, striking the inside\r\nof the further wall of the cylinder, which holds it while the spring\r\nuncoils. The tooth now pushes its way past the other edge, accelerating\r\nthe unwinding, and, as it escapes, the next tooth jumps forward and is\r\narrested by the outside of the cylinder. The balance now reverses its\r\nmotion, is helped by the tooth, is wound up, locks the tooth, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEVER ESCAPEMENT\r\n\r\nis somewhat more complicated. The escape-wheel teeth are locked and\r\nunlocked by the pallets P P^1 projecting from a lever which moves on a\r\npivot (Fig. 205). The end of the lever is forked, and has a square notch\r\nin it. On the arbor of the balance-wheel is a roller, or plate, R, which\r\ncarries a small pin, I. Two pins, B B, projecting from the plate of the\r\nwatch prevent the lever moving too far. We must further notice the\r\nlittle pin C on the lever, and a notch in the edge of the roller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205.--\"Lever\" watch escapement.]\r\n\r\nIn the illustration a tooth has just passed under the \"impulse face\" _b_\r\nof P^1. The lever has been moved upwards at the right end; and its\r\nforked end has given an impulse to R, and through it to the\r\nbalance-wheel. The spring winds up. The pin C prevents the lever\r\ndropping, because it no longer has the notch opposite to it, but presses\r\non the circumference of R. As the spring unwinds it strikes the lever at\r\nthe moment when the notch and C are opposite. The lever is knocked\r\ndownwards, and the tooth, which had been arrested by the locking-face\r\n_a_ of pallet P, now presses on the impulse face _b_, forcing the left\r\nend of the lever up. The impulse pin I receives a blow, assisting the\r\nunwinding of the spring, and C again locks the lever. The same thing is\r\nrepeated in alternate directions over and over again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATING BALANCE-WHEELS.\r\n\r\nThe watchmaker has had to overcome the same difficulty as the clockmaker\r\nwith regard to the expansion of the metal in the controlling agent. When\r\na metal wheel is heated its spokes lengthen, and the rim recedes from\r\nthe centre. Now, let us suppose that we have two rods of equal weight,\r\none three feet long, the other six feet long. To an end of each we\r\nfasten a 2-lb. weight. We shall find it much easier to wave the shorter\r\nrod backwards and forwards quickly than the other. Why? Because the\r\nweight of the longer rod has more leverage over the hand than has that\r\nof the shorter rod. Similarly, if, while the mass of the rim of a wheel\r\nremains constant, the length of the spokes varies, the effort needed to\r\nrotate the wheel to and fro at a constant rate must vary also. Graham\r\ngot over the difficulty with a rod by means of the compensating\r\npendulum. Thomas Earnshaw mastered it in wheels by means of the\r\n_compensating balance_, using the same principle--namely, the unequal\r\nexpansion of different metals. Any one who owns a compensated watch will\r\nsee, on stopping the tiny fly-wheel, that it has two spokes (Fig. 206),\r\neach carrying an almost complete semicircle of rim attached to it. A\r\nclose examination shows that the rim is compounded of an outer strip of\r\nbrass welded to an inner lining of steel. The brass element expands more\r\nwith heat and contracts more with cold than steel; so that when the\r\nspokes become elongated by a rise of temperature, the pieces bend\r\ninwards at their free ends (Fig. 207); if the temperature falls, the\r\nspokes are shortened, and the rim pieces bend outwards (Fig. 208).[39]\r\nThis ingenious contrivance keeps the leverage of the rim constant\r\nwithin very fine limits. The screws S S are inserted in the rim to\r\nbalance it correctly, and very fine adjustment is made by means of the\r\nfour tiny weights W W. In ships' chronometers,[40] the rim pieces are\r\n_sub_-compensated towards their free ends to counteract slight errors in\r\nthe primary compensation. So delicate is the compensation that a daily\r\nloss or gain of only half a second is often the limit of error.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206. FIG. 207. FIG. 208. A \"compensating\" watch\r\nbalance, at normal, super-normal, and sub-normal temperatures.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKEYLESS WINDING MECHANISM FOR WATCHES.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience attaching to a key-wound watch caused the Swiss\r\nmanufacturers to put on the market, in 1851, watches which dispensed\r\nwith a separate key. Those of our readers who carry keyless watches will\r\nbe interested to learn how the winding and setting of the hands is\r\neffected by the little serrated knob enclosed inside the pendant ring.\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of \"going-barrel\" keyless mechanism--(1) The rocking\r\nbar; (2) the shifting sleeve. The _rocking bar_ device is shown in Figs.\r\n209, 210. The milled head M turns a cog, G, which is always in gear with\r\na cog, F. This cog gears with two others, A and B, mounted at each end\r\nof the rocker R, which moves on pivot S. A spring, S P, attached to the\r\nwatch plate presses against a small stud on the rocking bar, and keeps A\r\nnormally in gear with C, mounted on the arbor of the mainspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209.--The winding mechanism of a keyless watch.]\r\n\r\nTo wind the watch, M is turned so as to give F an anti-clockwise motion.\r\nThe teeth of F now press A downwards and keep it in gear with C while\r\nthe winding is done. A spring click (marked solid black) prevents the\r\nspring uncoiling (Fig. 209). If F is turned in a clockwise direction it\r\nlifts A and prevents it biting the teeth of C, and no strain is thrown\r\non C.\r\n\r\nTo set the hands, the little push-piece P is pressed inwards by the\r\nthumb (Fig. 210) so as to depress the right-hand end of R and bring B\r\ninto gear with D, which in turn moves E, mounted on the end of the\r\nminute-hand shaft. The hands can now be moved in either direction by\r\nturning M. On releasing the push-piece the winding-wheels engage again.\r\n\r\nThe _shifting sleeve_ mechanism has a bevel pinion in the place of G\r\n(Fig. 209) gearing with the mainspring cog. The shaft of the knob M is\r\nround where it passes through the bevel and can turn freely inside it,\r\nbut is square below. On the square part is mounted a little sliding\r\nclutch with teeth on the top corresponding with the other teeth on the\r\nunder side of the bevel-wheel, and teeth similar to those of G (Fig.\r\n209) at the end. The clutch has a groove cut in the circumference, and\r\nin this lies the end of a spring lever which can be depressed by the\r\npush-piece. The mechanism much resembles on a small scale the motor car\r\nchanging gear (Fig. 49). Normally, the clutch is pushed up the square\r\npart of the knob shaft by the spring so as to engage with the bevel and\r\nthe winding-wheels. On depressing the clutch by means of the push-piece\r\nit gears with the minute-hand pinion, and lets go of the bevel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210.--The hand-setting mechanism in action.]\r\n\r\nIn one form of this mechanism the push-piece is dispensed with, and the\r\nminute-wheel pinion is engaged by pulling the knob upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUR-HAND TRAIN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211.--The hour-hand train of a clock.]\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the mainspring drum gear with a cog on the minute-hand\r\nshaft, which also carries one of the cogs of the escapement train. The\r\nshaft is permitted by the escapement to revolve once an hour. Fig. 211\r\nshows diagrammatically how this is managed. The hour-hand shaft A (solid\r\nblack) can be moved round inside the cog B, driven by the mainspring\r\ndrum. It carries a cog, C. This gears with a cog, D, having three times\r\nas many teeth. The cog E, united to D, drives cog F, having four times\r\nas many teeth as E. To F is attached the collar G of the hour-hand. F\r\nand G revolve outside the minute-hand shaft. On turning A, C turns D and\r\nE, E turns F and the hour-hand, which revolves 1/3 of 1/4 = 1/12 as fast\r\nas A.[41]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOCKS.\r\n\r\nOn these unfortunately necessary mechanisms a great deal of ingenuity\r\nhas been expended. With the advance of luxury and the increased worship\r\nof wealth, it becomes more and more necessary to guard one's belongings\r\nagainst the less scrupulous members of society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 212.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of lock, such as is found in desks and very cheap\r\narticles, works on the principle shown in Fig. 212. The bolt is split at\r\nthe rear, and the upper part bent upwards to form a spring. The under\r\nedge has two notches cut in it, separated by a curved excrescence. The\r\nkey merely presses the bolt upwards against the spring, until the notch,\r\nengaging with the frame, moves it backwards or forwards until the spring\r\ndrives the tail down into the other notch. This primitive device\r\naffords, of course, very little security. An advance is seen in the\r\n\r\nTUMBLER LOCK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213.]\r\n\r\nThe bolt now can move only in a horizontal direction. It has an opening\r\ncut in it with two notches (Figs. 213, 214). Behind the bolt lies the\r\n_tumbler_ T (indicated by the dotted line), pivoted at the angle on a\r\npin. From the face of the tumbler a stud, S, projects through the hole\r\nin the bolt. This stud is forced into one or other of the notches by the\r\nspring, S^1, which presses on the tail of the tumbler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 214.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 213 the key is about to actuate the locking mechanism. The next\r\ndiagram (Fig. 214) shows how the key, as it enters the notch on the\r\nlower side of the bolt to move it along, also raises the tumbler stud\r\nclear of the projection between the two notches. By the time that the\r\nbolt has been fully \"shot,\" the key leaves the under notch and allows\r\nthe tumbler stud to fall into the rear locking-notch.\r\n\r\nA lock of this type also can be picked very easily, as the picker has\r\nmerely to lift the tumbler and move the bolt along. Barron's lock,\r\npatented in 1778, had two tumblers and two studs; and the opening in the\r\nbolt had notches at the top as well as at the bottom (Fig. 215). This\r\nmade it necessary for both tumblers to be raised simultaneously to\r\nexactly the right height. If either was not lifted sufficiently, a stud\r\ncould not clear its bottom notch; if either rose too far, it engaged an\r\nupper notch. The chances therefore were greatly against a wrong key\r\nturning the lock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215.--The bolt of a Barron lock.]\r\n\r\nTHE CHUBB LOCK\r\n\r\nis an amplification of this principle. It usually has several tumblers\r\nof the shape shown in Fig. 216. The lock stud in these locks projects\r\nfrom the bolt itself, and the openings, or \"gates,\" through which the\r\nstud must pass as the lock moves, are cut in the tumblers. It will be\r\nnoticed that the forward notch of the tumbler has square serrations in\r\nthe edges. These engage with similar serrations in the bolt stud and\r\nmake it impossible to raise the tumbler if the bolt begins to move too\r\nsoon when a wrong key is inserted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216.--Tumbler of Chubb lock.]\r\n\r\nFig. 217 is a Chubb key with eight steps. That nearest the head (8)\r\noperates a circular revolving curtain, which prevents the introduction\r\nof picking tools when a key is inserted and partly turned, as the key\r\nslot in the curtain is no longer opposite that in the lock. Step 1 moves\r\nthe bolt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217.--A Chubb key.]\r\n\r\nIn order to shoot the bolt the height of the key steps must be so\r\nproportioned to the depth of their tumblers that all the gates in the\r\ntumblers are simultaneously raised to the right level for the stud to\r\npass through them, as in Fig. 218. Here you will observe that the\r\ntumbler D on the extreme right (lifted by step 2 of the key) has a stud,\r\nD S, projecting from it over the other tumblers. This is called the\r\n_detector tumbler_. If a false key or picking tool is inserted it is\r\ncertain to raise one of the tumblers too far. The detector is then\r\nover-lifted by the stud D S, and a spring catch falls into a notch at\r\nthe rear. It is now impossible to pick the lock, as the detector can be\r\nreleased only by the right key shooting the bolt a little further in the\r\nlocking direction, when a projection on the rear of the bolt lifts the\r\ncatch and allows the tumbler to fall. The detector also shows that the\r\nlock has been tampered with, since even the right key cannot move the\r\nbolt until the overlocking has been performed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218.--A Chubb key raising all the tumblers to the\r\ncorrect height.]\r\n\r\nEach tumbler step of a large Chubb key can be given one of thirty\r\ndifferent heights; the bolt step one of twenty. By merely transposing\r\nthe order of the steps in a six-step key it is possible to get 720\r\ndifferent combinations. By diminishing or increasing the heights the\r\npossible combinations may be raised to the enormous total of 7,776,000!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219.--Section of a Yale lock.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YALE LOCK,\r\n\r\nwhich comes from America, works on a quite different system. Its most\r\nnoticeable feature is that it permits the use of a very small key,\r\nthough the number of combinations possible is still enormous (several\r\nmillions). In our illustrations (Figs. 219, 220, 221) we show the\r\nmechanism controlling the turning of the key. The keyhole is a narrow\r\ntwisted slot in the face of a cylinder, G (Fig. 219), which revolves\r\ninside a larger fixed cylinder, F. As the key is pushed in, the notches\r\nin its upper edge raise up the pins A^1, B^1, C^1, D^1, E^1,\r\nuntil their tops exactly reach the surface of G, which can now be\r\nrevolved by the key in Fig. 220, and work the bolt through the medium of\r\nthe arm H. (The bolt itself is not shown.) If a wrong key is inserted,\r\neither some of the lower pins will project upwards into the fixed\r\ncylinder F (see Fig. 221), or some of the pins in F will sink into G. It\r\nis then impossible to turn the key.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 220.--Yale key turning.]\r\n\r\nThere are other well-known locks, such as those invented by Bramah and\r\nHobbs. But as these do not lend themselves readily to illustration no\r\ndetailed account can be given. We might, however, notice the _time_\r\nlock, which is set to a certain hour, and can be opened by the right key\r\nor a number of keys in combination only when that hour is reached.\r\nAnother very interesting device is the _automatic combination_ lock.\r\nThis may have twenty or more keys, any one of which can lock it; but the\r\nsame one must be used to _un_lock it, as the key automatically sets the\r\nmechanism in favour of itself. With such a lock it would be possible to\r\nhave a different key for every day in the month; and if any one key got\r\ninto wrong hands it would be useless unless it happened to be the one\r\nwhich last locked the lock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221.--The wrong key inserted. The pins do not allow\r\nthe lock to be turned.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CYCLE.\r\n\r\nThere are a few features of this useful and in some ways wonderful\r\ncontrivance which should be noticed. First,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEARING OF A CYCLE.\r\n\r\nTo a good many people the expression \"geared to 70 inches,\" or 65, or\r\n80, as the case may be, conveys nothing except the fact that the higher\r\nthe gear the faster one ought to be able to travel. Let us therefore\r\nexamine the meaning of such a phrase before going farther.\r\n\r\nThe safety cycle is always \"geared up\"--that is, one turn of the pedals\r\nwill turn the rear wheel more than once. To get the exact ratio of\r\nturning speed we count the teeth on the big chain-wheel, and the teeth\r\non the small chain-wheel attached to the hub of the rear wheel, and\r\ndivide the former by the latter. To take an example:--The teeth are 75\r\nand 30 in number respectively; the ratio of speed therefore = 75/30 =\r\n5/2 = 2-1/2. One turn of the pedal turns the rear wheel 2-1/2 times. The\r\ngear of the cycle is calculated by multiplying this result by the\r\ndiameter of the rear wheel in inches. Thus a 28-inch wheel would in this\r\ncase give a gear of 2-1/2 × 28 = 70 inches.\r\n\r\nOne turn of the pedals on a machine of this gear would propel the rider\r\nas far as if he were on a high \"ordinary\" with the pedals attached\r\ndirectly to a wheel 70 inches in diameter. The gearing is raised or\r\nlowered by altering the number ratio of the teeth on the two\r\nchain-wheels. If for the 30-tooth wheel we substituted one of 25 teeth\r\nthe gearing would be--\r\n\r\n  75/25 × 28 inches = 84 inches.\r\n\r\nA handy formula to remember is, gearing = T/_t_ × D, where T = teeth on\r\nlarge chain-wheel; _t_ = teeth on small chain-wheel; and D = diameter of\r\ndriving-wheel in inches.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most important improvements recently added to the cycle\r\nare--(1) The free wheel; (2) the change-speed gear.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREE WHEEL\r\n\r\nis a device for enabling the driving-wheel to overrun the pedals when\r\nthe rider ceases pedalling; it renders the driving-wheel \"free\" of the\r\ndriving gear. It is a ratchet specially suited for this kind of work.\r\nFrom among the many patterns now marketed we select the Micrometer\r\nfree-wheel hub (Fig. 222), which is extremely simple. The\r\n_ratchet-wheel_ R is attached to the hub of the driving-wheel. The small\r\nchain-wheel (or \"chain-ring,\" as it is often called) turns outside this,\r\non a number of balls running in a groove chased in the neck of the\r\nratchet. Between these two parts are the _pawls_, of half-moon shape.\r\nThe driving-wheel is assumed to be on the further side of the ratchet.\r\nTo propel the cycle the chain-ring is turned in a clockwise direction.\r\nThree out of the six pawls at once engage with notches in the ratchet,\r\nand are held tightly in place by the pressure of the chain-ring on their\r\nrear ends. The other three are in a midway position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 222.]\r\n\r\nWhen the rider ceases to pedal, the chain-ring becomes stationary, but\r\nthe ratchet continues to revolve. The pawls offer no resistance to the\r\nratchet teeth, which push them up into the semicircular recesses in the\r\nchain-ring. Each one rises as it passes over a tooth. It is obvious\r\nthat driving power cannot be transmitted again to the road wheel until\r\nthe chain-wheel is turned fast enough to overtake the ratchet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGE-SPEED GEAR.\r\n\r\nA gain in speed means a loss in power, and _vice versâ_. By gearing-up a\r\ncycle we are able to make the driving-wheel revolve faster than the\r\npedals, but at the expense of control over the driving-wheel. A\r\nhigh-geared cycle is fast on the level, but a bad hill-climber. The\r\nlow-geared machine shows to disadvantage on the flat, but is a good\r\nhill-climber. Similarly, the express engine must have large\r\ndriving-wheels, the goods engine small driving-wheels, to perform their\r\nspecial functions properly.\r\n\r\nIn order to travel fast over level country, and yet be able to mount\r\nhills without undue exertion, we must be able to do what the motorist\r\ndoes--change gear. Two-speed and three-speed gears are now very commonly\r\nfitted to cycles. They all work on the same principle, that of the\r\nepicyclic train of cog-wheels, the mechanisms being so devised that the\r\nhub turns more slowly than, at the same speed as, or faster than the\r\nsmall chain-wheel,[42] according to the wish of the rider.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to do more here than explain the principle of the\r\nepicyclic train, which means \"a wheel on (or running round) a wheel.\"\r\nLay a footrule on the table and roll a cylinder along it by the aid of a\r\nsecond rule, parallel to the first, but resting on the cylinder. It will\r\nbe found that, while the cylinder advances six inches, the upper rule\r\nadvances twice that distance. In the absence of friction the work done\r\nby the agent moving the upper rule is equal to that done in overcoming\r\nthe force which opposes the forward motion of the cylinder; and as the\r\ndistance through which the cylinder advances is only half that through\r\nwhich the upper rule advances, it follows that the _force_ which must\r\nact on the upper rule is only half as great as that overcome in moving\r\nthe cylinder. The carter makes use of this principle when he puts his\r\nhand to the top of a wheel to help his cart over an obstacle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 223.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 224.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225.]\r\n\r\nNow see how this principle is applied to the change-speed gear. The\r\nlower rule is replaced by a cog-wheel, C (Fig. 223); the cylinder by a\r\ncog, B, running round it; and the upper rule by a ring, A, with internal\r\nteeth. We may suppose that A is the chain-ring, B a cog mounted on a pin\r\nprojecting from the hub, and C a cog attached to the fixed axle. It is\r\nevident that B will not move so fast round C as A does. The amount by\r\nwhich A will get ahead of B can be calculated easily. We begin with the\r\nwheels in the position shown in Fig. 223. A point, I, on A is exactly\r\nover the topmost point of C. For the sake of convenience we will first\r\nassume that instead of B running round C, B is revolved on its axis for\r\none complete revolution in a clockwise direction, and that A and C move\r\nas in Fig. 224. If B has 10 teeth, C 30, and A 40, A will have been\r\nmoved 10/40 = 1/4 of a revolution in a clockwise direction, and C 10/30\r\n= 1/3 of a revolution in an anti-clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nNow, coming back to what actually does happen, we shall be able to\r\nunderstand how far A rotates round C relatively to the motion of B, when\r\nC is fixed and B rolls (Fig. 225). B advances 1/3 of distance round C; A\r\nadvances 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 of distance round B. The fractions, if reduced\r\nto a common denominator, are as 4:7, and this is equivalent to 40\r\n(number of teeth on A): 40 + 30 (teeth on A + teeth on C.)\r\n\r\nTo leave the reader with a very clear idea we will summarize the matter\r\nthus:--If T = number of teeth on A, _t_ = number of teeth on C, then\r\nmovement of A: movement of B:: T + _t_: T.\r\n\r\nHere is a two-speed hub. Let us count the teeth. The chain-ring (= A)\r\nhas 64 internal teeth, and the central cog (= C) on the axle has 16\r\nteeth. There are four cogs (= B) equally spaced, running on pins\r\nprojecting from the hub-shell between A and C. How much faster than B\r\ndoes A run round C? Apply the formula:--Motion of A: motion of B:: 64 +\r\n16: 64. That is, while A revolves once, B and the hub and the\r\ndriving-wheel will revolve only 64/80 = 4/5 of a turn. To use scientific\r\nlanguage, B revolves 20 per cent. slower than A.\r\n\r\nThis is the gearing we use for hill-climbing. On the level we want the\r\ndriving-wheel to turn as fast as, or faster than, the chain-ring. To\r\nmake it turn at the same rate, both A and C must revolve together. In\r\none well-known gear this is effected by sliding C along the spindle of\r\nthe wheel till it disengages itself from the spindle, and one end locks\r\nwith the plate which carries A. Since B is now being pulled round at the\r\nbottom as well as the top, it cannot rotate on its own axis any longer,\r\nand the whole train revolves _solidly_--that is, while A turns through a\r\ncircle B does the same.\r\n\r\nTo get an _increase_ of gearing, matters must be so arranged that the\r\ndrive is transmitted from the chain-wheel to B, and from A to the hub.\r\nWhile B describes a circle, A and the driving-wheel turn through a\r\ncircle and a part of a circle--that is, the driving-wheel revolves\r\nfaster than the hub. Given the same number of teeth as before, the\r\nproportional rates will be A = 80, B = 64, so that the gear _rises_ 25\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nBy means of proper mechanism the power is transmitted in a three-speed\r\ngear either (1) from chain-wheel to A, A to B, B to wheel = _low_ gear;\r\nor (2) from chain-wheel to A and C simultaneously = solid, normal, or\r\n_middle_ gear; or (3) from chain-wheel to B, B to A, A to wheel = _high_\r\ngear. In two-speed gears either 1 or 3 is omitted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL MACHINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THRESHING-MACHINE.\r\n\r\nBread would not be so cheap as it is were the flail still the only means\r\nof separating the grain from the straw. What the cream separator has\r\ndone for the dairy industry (p. 384), the threshing-machine has done for\r\nagriculture. A page or two ought therefore to be spared for this useful\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 226.--Section of a threshing machine.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 226 a very complete fore-and-aft section of the machine is\r\ngiven. After the bands of the sheaves have been cut, the latter are fed\r\ninto the mouth of the _drum_ A by the feeder, who stands in the\r\nfeeding-box on the top of the machine. The drum revolves at a very high\r\nvelocity, and is fitted with fluted beaters which act against a steel\r\nconcave, or breastwork, B, the grain being threshed out of the straw in\r\npassing between the two. The breastwork is provided with open wires,\r\nthrough which most of the threshed grain, cavings (short straws), and\r\nchaff passes on to a sloping board. The straw is flung forward on to the\r\nshakers C, which gradually move the straw towards the open end and throw\r\nit off. Any grain, etc., that has escaped the drum falls through the\r\nshakers on to D, and works backwards to the _caving riddles_, or moving\r\nsieves, E. The _main blower_, by means of a revolving fan, N, sends air\r\nalong the channel X upwards through these riddles, blowing the short\r\nstraws away to the left. The grain, husks, and dust fall through E on to\r\nG, over the end of which they fall on to the _chaff riddle_, H. A second\r\ncolumn of air from the blower drives the chaff away. The heavy grain,\r\nseeds, dust, etc., fall on to I, J, and K in turn, and are shaken until\r\nonly the grain remains to pass along L to the elevator bottom, M. An\r\nendless band with cups attached to it scoops up the grain, carries it\r\naloft, and shoots it into hopper P. It then goes through the shakers Q,\r\nR, is dusted by the _back end blower_, S, and slides down T into the\r\nopen end of the rotary screen-drum U, which is mounted on the slope, so\r\nthat as it turns the grain travels gradually along it. The first half of\r\nthe screen has wires set closely together. All the small grain that\r\nfalls through this, called \"thirds,\" passes into a hopper, and is\r\ncollected in a sack attached to the hopper mouth. The \"seconds\" fall\r\nthrough the second half of the drum, more widely spaced, into their\r\nsack; and the \"firsts\" fall out of the end and through a third spout.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOWING-MACHINES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 227.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary _lawn--mower_ employs a revolving reel, built up of\r\nspirally-arranged knives, the edges of which pass very close to a sharp\r\nplate projecting from the frame of the mower. Each blade, as it turns,\r\nworks along the plate, giving a shearing cut to any grass that may be\r\ncaught between the two cutting edges. The action is that of a pair of\r\nscissors (Fig. 227), one blade representing the fixed, the other the\r\nmoving knife. If you place a cylinder of wood in the scissors it will be\r\ndriven forward by the closing of the blades, and be marked by them as\r\nit passes along the edges. The same thing happens with grass, which is\r\nso soft that it is cut right through.\r\n\r\nHAY-CUTTER.\r\n\r\nThe _hay-cutter_ is another adaptation of the same principle. A\r\ncutter-bar is pulled rapidly backwards and forwards in a frame which\r\nruns a few inches above the ground by a crank driven by the wheels\r\nthrough gearing. To the front edge of the bar are attached by one side a\r\nnumber of triangular knives. The frame carries an equal number of spikes\r\npointing forward horizontally. Through slots in these the cutter-bar\r\nworks, and its knives give a drawing cut to grass caught between them\r\nand the sides of the spikes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOME NATURAL PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SUN-HEAT VARIES IN INTENSITY.\r\n\r\nThe more squarely parallel heat-rays strike a surface the greater will\r\nbe the number that can affect that surface. This is evident from Figs.\r\n228, 229, where A B is an equal distance in both cases. The nearer the\r\nsun is to the horizon, the more obliquely do its rays strike the earth.\r\nHence midday is necessarily warmer than the evening, and the tropics,\r\nwhere the sun stands overhead, are hotter than the temperate zones,\r\nwhere, even in summer at midday, the rays fall more or less on the\r\nslant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229.]\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric envelope which encompasses the earth tends to increase\r\nthe effect of obliquity, since a slanting ray has to travel further\r\nthrough it and is robbed of more heat than a vertical ray.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIDES.\r\n\r\nAll bodies have an attraction for one another. The earth attracts the\r\nmoon, and the moon attracts the earth. Now, though the effect of this\r\nattraction is not visible as regards the solid part of the globe, it is\r\nstrongly manifested by the water which covers a large portion of the\r\nearth's surface. The moon attracts the water most powerfully at two\r\npoints, that nearest to it and that furthest away from it; as shown on\r\nan exaggerated scale in Fig. 230. Since the earth and the water revolve\r\nas one mass daily on their axis, every point on the circumference would\r\nbe daily nearest to and furthest from the moon at regular intervals, and\r\nwherever there is ocean there would be two tides in that period, were\r\nthe moon stationary as regards the earth. (It should be clearly\r\nunderstood that the tides are not great currents, but mere thickenings\r\nof the watery envelope. The inrush of the tide is due to the temporary\r\nrise of level.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY HIGH TIDE VARIES DAILY.\r\n\r\nThe moon travels round the earth once in twenty-eight days. In Fig. 231\r\nthe point _a_ is nearest the moon at, say, twelve noon. At the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours it will have arrived at the same position by the\r\ncompass, but yet not be nearest to the moon, which has in that period\r\nmoved on 1/28th of a revolution round the earth.[43] Consequently high\r\ntide will not occur till _a_ has reached position _b_ and overtaken the\r\nmoon, as it were, which takes about an hour on the average. This\r\nexplains why high tide occurs at intervals of more than twelve hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232.--Relative positions of sun, moon, and earth at\r\n\"spring\" tides.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233.--Relative positions of sun, moon, and earth at\r\n\"neap\" tides.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNEAP TIDES AND SPRING TIDES.\r\n\r\nThe sun, as well as the moon, attracts the ocean, but with less power,\r\nowing to its being so much further away. At certain periods of the\r\nmonth, sun, earth, and moon are all in line. Sun and moon then pull\r\ntogether, and we get the highest, or _spring_ tides (Fig. 232). When sun\r\nand moon pull at right angles to one another--namely, at the first and\r\nthird quarters--the excrescence caused by the moon is flattened (Fig.\r\n233), and we get the lowest, or _neap_ tides.\r\n\r\n[39] In both Figs. 207 and 208 the degree of expansion is very greatly\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\n[40] As the sun passes the meridian (twelve o'clock, noon) the\r\nchronometer's reading is taken, and the longitude, or distance east or\r\nwest of Greenwich, is reckoned by the difference in time between local\r\nnoon and that of the chronometer.\r\n\r\n[41] For much of the information given here about clocks and watches the\r\nauthor is indebted to \"The History of Watches,\" by Mr. J.F. Kendal.\r\n\r\n[42] We shall here notice only those gears which are included in the hub\r\nof the driving-wheel.\r\n\r\n[43] The original position of the moon is indicated by the dotted\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Figures in italics signify that an illustration of the thing\r\nreferred to appears on the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aberration, spherical, of lens,
