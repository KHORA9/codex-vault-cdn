AUTHOR'S FOREWORD\r\n\r\nI FEAR the seemingly incredible story which I am about to relate will be\r\nregarded as the result of a distorted intellect superinduced, possibly,\r\nby the glamour of unveiling a marvelous mystery, rather than a truthful\r\nrecord of the unparalleled experiences related by one Olaf Jansen, whose\r\neloquent madness so appealed to my imagination that all thought of an\r\nanalytical criticism has been effectually dispelled.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo will doubtless shift uneasily in his grave at the strange\r\nstory I am called upon to chronicle; a story as strange as a Munchausen\r\ntale. It is also incongruous that I, a disbeliever, should be the one\r\nto edit the story of Olaf Jansen, whose name is now for the first time\r\ngiven to the world, yet who must hereafter rank as one of the notables\r\nof earth.\r\n\r\nI freely confess his statements admit of no rational analysis, but have\r\nto do with the profound mystery concerning the frozen North that for\r\ncenturies has claimed the attention of scientists and laymen alike.\r\n\r\nHowever much they are at variance with the cosmographical manuscripts of\r\nthe past, these plain statements may be relied upon as a record of the\r\nthings Olaf Jansen claims to have seen with his own eyes.\r\n\r\nA hundred times I have asked myself whether it is possible that the\r\nworld's geography is incomplete, and that the startling narrative of\r\nOlaf Jansen is predicated upon demonstrable facts. The reader may be\r\nable to answer these queries to his own satisfaction, however far the\r\nchronicler of this narrative may be from having reached a conviction.\r\nYet sometimes even I am at a loss to know whether I have been led away\r\nfrom an abstract truth by the ignes fatui of a clever superstition, or\r\nwhether heretofore accepted facts are, after all, founded upon falsity.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the true home of Apollo was not at Delphi, but in that\r\nolder earth-center of which Plato speaks, where he says: \"Apollo's\r\nreal home is among the Hyperboreans, in a land of perpetual life, where\r\nmythology tells us two doves flying from the two opposite ends of the\r\nworld met in this fair region, the home of Apollo. Indeed, according\r\nto Hecataeus, Leto, the mother of Apollo, was born on an island in the\r\nArctic Ocean far beyond the North Wind.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to attempt a discussion of the theogony of the\r\ndeities nor the cosmogony of the world. My simple duty is to enlighten\r\nthe world concerning a heretofore unknown portion of the universe, as it\r\nwas seen and described by the old Norseman, Olaf Jansen.\r\n\r\nInterest in northern research is international. Eleven nations are\r\nengaged in, or have contributed to, the perilous work of trying to solve\r\nEarth's one remaining cosmological mystery.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying, ancient as the hills, that \"truth is stranger than\r\nfiction,\" and in a most startling manner has this axiom been brought\r\nhome to me within the last fortnight.\r\n\r\nIt was just two o'clock in the morning when I was aroused from a restful\r\nsleep by the vigorous ringing of my door-bell. The untimely disturber\r\nproved to be a messenger bearing a note, scrawled almost to the point\r\nof illegibility, from an old Norseman by the name of Olaf Jansen. After\r\nmuch deciphering, I made out the writing, which simply said: \"Am ill\r\nunto death. Come.\" The call was imperative, and I lost no time in making\r\nready to comply.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may as well explain here that Olaf Jansen, a man who quite\r\nrecently celebrated his ninety-fifth birthday, has for the last\r\nhalf-dozen years been living alone in an unpretentious bungalow out\r\nGlendale way, a short distance from the business district of Los\r\nAngeles, California.\r\n\r\nIt was less than two years ago, while out walking one afternoon that\r\nI was attracted by Olaf Jansen's house and its homelike surroundings,\r\ntoward its owner and occupant, whom I afterward came to know as a\r\nbeliever in the ancient worship of Odin and Thor.\r\n\r\nThere was a gentleness in his face, and a kindly expression in the\r\nkeenly alert gray eyes of this man who had lived more than four-score\r\nyears and ten; and, withal, a sense of loneliness that appealed to my\r\nsympathy. Slightly stooped, and with his hands clasped behind him, he\r\nwalked back and forth with slow and measured tread, that day when first\r\nwe met. I can hardly say what particular motive impelled me to pause\r\nin my walk and engage him in conversation. He seemed pleased when I\r\ncomplimented him on the attractiveness of his bungalow, and on the\r\nwell-tended vines and flowers clustering in profusion over its windows,\r\nroof and wide piazza.\r\n\r\nI soon discovered that my new acquaintance was no ordinary person, but\r\none profound and learned to a remarkable degree; a man who, in the later\r\nyears of his long life, had dug deeply into books and become strong in\r\nthe power of meditative silence.\r\n\r\nI encouraged him to talk, and soon gathered that he had resided only six\r\nor seven years in Southern California, but had passed the dozen years\r\nprior in one of the middle Eastern states. Before that he had been a\r\nfisherman off the coast of Norway, in the region of the Lofoden Islands,\r\nfrom whence he had made trips still farther north to Spitzbergen and\r\neven to Franz Josef Land.\r\n\r\nWhen I started to take my leave, he seemed reluctant to have me go, and\r\nasked me to come again. Although at the time I thought nothing of it,\r\nI remember now that he made a peculiar remark as I extended my hand in\r\nleave-taking. \"You will come again?\" he asked. \"Yes, you will come again\r\nsome day. I am sure you will; and I shall show you my library and tell\r\nyou many things of which you have never dreamed, things so wonderful\r\nthat it may be you will not believe me.\"\r\n\r\nI laughingly assured him that I would not only come again, but would be\r\nready to believe whatever he might choose to tell me of his travels and\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed I became well acquainted with Olaf Jansen,\r\nand, little by little, he told me his story, so marvelous, that its very\r\ndaring challenges reason and belief. The old Norseman always expressed\r\nhimself with so much earnestness and sincerity that I became enthralled\r\nby his strange narrations.\r\n\r\nThen came the messenger's call that night, and within the hour I was at\r\nOlaf Jansen's bungalow.\r\n\r\nHe was very impatient at the long wait, although after being summoned I\r\nhad come immediately to his bedside.\r\n\r\n\"I must hasten,\" he exclaimed, while yet he held my hand in greeting.\r\n\"I have much to tell you that you know not, and I will trust no one but\r\nyou. I fully realize,\" he went on hurriedly, \"that I shall not survive\r\nthe night. The time has come to join my fathers in the great sleep.\"\r\n\r\nI adjusted the pillows to make him more comfortable, and assured him\r\nI was glad to be able to serve him in any way possible, for I was\r\nbeginning to realize the seriousness of his condition.\r\n\r\nThe lateness of the hour, the stillness of the surroundings, the uncanny\r\nfeeling of being alone with the dying man, together with his weird\r\nstory, all combined to make my heart beat fast and loud with a feeling\r\nfor which I have no name. Indeed, there were many times that night by\r\nthe old Norseman's couch, and there have been many times since, when a\r\nsensation rather than a conviction took possession of my very soul, and\r\nI seemed not only to believe in, but actually see, the strange lands,\r\nthe strange people and the strange world of which he told, and to hear\r\nthe mighty orchestral chorus of a thousand lusty voices.\r\n\r\nFor over two hours he seemed endowed with almost superhuman strength,\r\ntalking rapidly, and to all appearances, rationally. Finally he gave\r\ninto my hands certain data, drawings and crude maps. \"These,\" said he in\r\nconclusion, \"I leave in your hands. If I can have your promise to give\r\nthem to the world, I shall die happy, because I desire that people may\r\nknow the truth, for then all mystery concerning the frozen Northland\r\nwill be explained. There is no chance of your suffering the fate\r\nI suffered. They will not put you in irons, nor confine you in a\r\nmad-house, because you are not telling your own story, but mine, and I,\r\nthanks to the gods, Odin and Thor, will be in my grave, and so beyond\r\nthe reach of disbelievers who would persecute.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a thought of the farreaching results the promise entailed, or\r\nforeseeing the many sleepless nights which the obligation has since\r\nbrought me, I gave my hand and with it a pledge to discharge faithfully\r\nhis dying wish.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose over the peaks of the San Jacinto, far to the eastward,\r\nthe spirit of Olaf Jansen, the navigator, the explorer and worshiper of\r\nOdin and Thor, the man whose experiences and travels, as related, are\r\nwithout a parallel in all the world's history, passed away, and I was\r\nleft alone with the dead.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after having paid the last sad rites to this strange man\r\nfrom the Lofoden Islands, and the still farther \"Northward Ho!\", the\r\ncourageous explorer of frozen regions, who in his declining years (after\r\nhe had passed the four-score mark) had sought an asylum of restful peace\r\nin sun-favored California, I will undertake to make public his story.\r\n\r\nBut, first of all, let me indulge in one or two reflections:\r\n\r\nGeneration follows generation, and the traditions from the misty past\r\nare handed down from sire to son, but for some strange reason interest\r\nin the ice-locked unknown does not abate with the receding years, either\r\nin the minds of the ignorant or the tutored.\r\n\r\nWith each new generation a restless impulse stirs the hearts of men to\r\ncapture the veiled citadel of the Arctic, the circle of silence, the\r\nland of glaciers, cold wastes of waters and winds that are strangely\r\nwarm. Increasing interest is manifested in the mountainous icebergs, and\r\nmarvelous speculations are indulged in concerning the earth's center of\r\ngravity, the cradle of the tides, where the whales have their nurseries,\r\nwhere the magnetic needle goes mad, where the Aurora Borealis illumines\r\nthe night, and where brave and courageous spirits of every generation\r\ndare to venture and explore, defying the dangers of the \"Farthest\r\nNorth.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the ablest works of recent years is \"Paradise Found, or the\r\nCradle of The Human Race at the North Pole,\" by William F. Warren. In\r\nhis carefully prepared volume, Mr. Warren almost stubbed his toe against\r\nthe real truth, but missed it seemingly by only a hair's breadth, if the\r\nold Norseman's revelation be true.\r\n\r\nDr. Orville Livingston Leech, scientist, in a recent article, says:\r\n\r\n\"The possibilities of a land inside the earth were first brought to my\r\nattention when I picked up a geode on the shores of the Great Lakes.\r\nThe geode is a spherical and apparently solid stone, but when broken is\r\nfound to be hollow and coated with crystals. The earth is only a larger\r\nform of a geode, and the law that created the geode in its hollow form\r\nundoubtedly fashioned the earth in the same way.\"\r\n\r\nIn presenting the theme of this almost incredible story, as told by\r\nOlaf Jansen, and supplemented by manuscript, maps and crude drawings\r\nentrusted to me, a fitting introduction is found in the following\r\nquotation:\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth\r\nwas without form and void.\" And also, \"God created man in his own\r\nimage.\" Therefore, even in things material, man must be God-like,\r\nbecause he is created in the likeness of the Father.\r\n\r\nA man builds a house for himself and family. The porches or verandas are\r\nall without, and are secondary. The building is really constructed for\r\nthe conveniences within.\r\n\r\nOlaf Jansen makes the startling announcement through me, an humble\r\ninstrument, that in like manner, God created the earth for the\r\n\"within\"--that is to say, for its lands, seas, rivers, mountains,\r\nforests and valleys, and for its other internal conveniences, while the\r\noutside surface of the earth is merely the veranda, the porch, where\r\nthings grow by comparison but sparsely, like the lichen on the mountain\r\nside, clinging determinedly for bare existence.\r\n\r\nTake an egg-shell, and from each end break out a piece as large as\r\nthe end of this pencil. Extract its contents, and then you will have\r\na perfect representation of Olaf Jansen's earth. The distance from the\r\ninside surface to the outside surface, according to him, is about three\r\nhundred miles. The center of gravity is not in the center of the earth,\r\nbut in the center of the shell or crust; therefore, if the thickness of\r\nthe earth's crust or shell is three hundred miles, the center of gravity\r\nis one hundred and fifty miles below the surface.\r\n\r\nIn their log-books Arctic explorers tell us of the dipping of the needle\r\nas the vessel sails in regions of the farthest north known. In reality,\r\nthey are at the curve; on the edge of the shell, where gravity is\r\ngeometrically increased, and while the electric current seemingly dashes\r\noff into space toward the phantom idea of the North Pole, yet this same\r\nelectric current drops again and continues its course southward along\r\nthe inside surface of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nIn the appendix to his work, Captain Sabine gives an account of\r\nexperiments to determine the acceleration of the pendulum in different\r\nlatitudes. This appears to have resulted from the joint labor of Peary\r\nand Sabine. He says: \"The accidental discovery that a pendulum on being\r\nremoved from Paris to the neighborhood of the equator increased its\r\ntime of vibration, gave the first step to our present knowledge that the\r\npolar axis of the globe is less than the equatorial; that the force of\r\ngravity at the surface of the earth increases progressively from the\r\nequator toward the poles.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Olaf Jansen, in the beginning this old world of ours was\r\ncreated solely for the \"within\" world, where are located the four great\r\nrivers--the Euphrates, the Pison, the Gihon and the Hiddekel. These same\r\nnames of rivers, when applied to streams on the \"outside\" surface of\r\nthe earth, are purely traditional from an antiquity beyond the memory of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nOn the top of a high mountain, near the fountain-head of these four\r\nrivers, Olaf Jansen, the Norseman, claims to have discovered the\r\nlong-lost \"Garden of Eden,\" the veritable navel of the earth, and to\r\nhave spent over two years studying and reconnoitering in this marvelous\r\n\"within\" land, exuberant with stupendous plant life and abounding in\r\ngiant animals; a land where the people live to be centuries old, after\r\nthe order of Methuselah and other Biblical characters; a region where\r\none-quarter of the \"inner\" surface is water and three-quarters land;\r\nwhere there are large oceans and many rivers and lakes; where the\r\ncities are superlative in construction and magnificence; where modes\r\nof transportation are as far in advance of ours as we with our boasted\r\nachievements are in advance of the inhabitants of \"darkest Africa.\"\r\n\r\nThe distance directly across the space from inner surface to inner\r\nsurface is about six hundred miles less than the recognized diameter of\r\nthe earth. In the identical center of this vast vacuum is the seat of\r\nelectricity--a mammoth ball of dull red fire--not startlingly brilliant,\r\nbut surrounded by a white, mild, luminous cloud, giving out uniform\r\nwarmth, and held in its place in the center of this internal space by\r\nthe immutable law of gravitation. This electrical cloud is known to the\r\npeople \"within\" as the abode of \"The Smoky God.\" They believe it to be\r\nthe throne of \"The Most High.\"\r\n\r\nOlaf Jansen reminded me of how, in the old college days, we were all\r\nfamiliar with the laboratory demonstrations of centrifugal motion, which\r\nclearly proved that, if the earth were a solid, the rapidity of its\r\nrevolution upon its axis would tear it into a thousand fragments.\r\n\r\nThe old Norseman also maintained that from the farthest points of land\r\non the islands of Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land, flocks of geese may\r\nbe seen annually flying still farther northward, just as the sailors and\r\nexplorers record in their log-books. No scientist has yet been audacious\r\nenough to attempt to explain, even to his own satisfaction, toward what\r\nlands these winged fowls are guided by their subtle instinct. However,\r\nOlaf Jansen has given us a most reasonable explanation.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the open sea in the Northland is also explained. Olaf\r\nJansen claims that the northern aperture, intake or hole, so to speak,\r\nis about fourteen hundred miles across. In connection with this, let us\r\nread what Explorer Nansen writes, on page 288 of his book: \"I have never\r\nhad such a splendid sail. On to the north, steadily north, with a good\r\nwind, as fast as steam and sail can take us, an open sea mile after\r\nmile, watch after watch, through these unknown regions, always clearer\r\nand clearer of ice, one might almost say: 'How long will it last?' The\r\neye always turns to the northward as one paces the bridge. It is gazing\r\ninto the future. But there is always the same dark sky ahead which means\r\nopen sea.\" Again, the Norwood Review of England, in its issue of May\r\n10, 1884, says: \"We do not admit that there is ice up to the Pole--once\r\ninside the great ice barrier, a new world breaks upon the explorer, the\r\nclimate is mild like that of England, and, afterward, balmy as the Greek\r\nIsles.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the rivers \"within,\" Olaf Jansen claims, are larger than our\r\nMississippi and Amazon rivers combined, in point of volume of water\r\ncarried; indeed their greatness is occasioned by their width and depth\r\nrather than their length, and it is at the mouths of these mighty\r\nrivers, as they flow northward and southward along the inside surface\r\nof the earth, that mammoth icebergs are found, some of them fifteen and\r\ntwenty miles wide and from forty to one hundred miles in length.\r\n\r\nIs it not strange that there has never been an iceberg encountered\r\neither in the Arctic or Antarctic Ocean that is not composed of fresh\r\nwater? Modern scientists claim that freezing eliminates the salt, but\r\nOlaf Jansen claims differently.\r\n\r\nAncient Hindoo, Japanese and Chinese writings, as well as the\r\nhieroglyphics of the extinct races of the North American continent,\r\nall speak of the custom of sun-worshiping, and it is possible, in the\r\nstartling light of Olaf Jansen's revelations, that the people of the\r\ninner world, lured away by glimpses of the sun as it shone upon the\r\ninner surface of the earth, either from the northern or the southern\r\nopening, became dissatisfied with \"The Smoky God,\" the great pillar or\r\nmother cloud of electricity, and, weary of their continuously mild and\r\npleasant atmosphere, followed the brighter light, and were finally led\r\nbeyond the ice belt and scattered over the \"outer\" surface of the earth,\r\nthrough Asia, Europe, North America and, later, Africa, Australia and\r\nSouth America. (1)\r\n\r\n(1 The following quotation is significant; \"It follows that man\r\nissuing from a mother-region still undetermined but which a number\r\nof considerations indicate to have been in the North, has radiated in\r\nseveral directions; that his migrations have been constantly from North\r\nto South.\"--M. le Marquis G. de Saporta, in Popular Science Monthly,\r\nOctober, 1883, page 753.)\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact that, as we approach the Equator, the stature of\r\nthe human race grows less. But the Patagonians of South America are\r\nprobably the only aborigines from the center of the earth who came out\r\nthrough the aperture usually designated as the South Pole, and they are\r\ncalled the giant race.\r\n\r\nOlaf Jansen avers that, in the beginning, the world was created by\r\nthe Great Architect of the Universe, so that man might dwell upon\r\nits \"inside\" surface, which has ever since been the habitation of the\r\n\"chosen.\"\r\n\r\nThey who were driven out of the \"Garden of Eden\" brought their\r\ntraditional history with them.\r\n\r\nThe history of the people living \"within\" contains a narrative\r\nsuggesting the story of Noah and the ark with which we are familiar. He\r\nsailed away, as did Columbus, from a certain port, to a strange land\r\nhe had heard of far to the northward, carrying with him all manner\r\nof beasts of the fields and fowls of the air, but was never heard of\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nOn the northern boundaries of Alaska, and still more frequently on\r\nthe Siberian coast, are found boneyards containing tusks of ivory in\r\nquantities so great as to suggest the burying-places of antiquity. From\r\nOlaf Jansen's account, they have come from the great prolific animal\r\nlife that abounds in the fields and forests and on the banks of numerous\r\nrivers of the Inner World. The materials were caught in the ocean\r\ncurrents, or were carried on ice-floes, and have accumulated like\r\ndriftwood on the Siberian coast. This has been going on for ages, and\r\nhence these mysterious bone-yards.\r\n\r\nOn this subject William F. Warren, in his book already cited, pages 297\r\nand 298, says: \"The Arctic rocks tell of a lost Atlantis more wonderful\r\nthan Plato's. The fossil ivory beds of Siberia excel everything of\r\nthe kind in the world. From the days of Pliny, at least, they have\r\nconstantly been undergoing exploitation, and still they are the chief\r\nheadquarters of supply. The remains of mammoths are so abundant that, as\r\nGratacap says, 'the northern islands of Siberia seem built up of crowded\r\nbones.' Another scientific writer, speaking of the islands of New\r\nSiberia, northward of the mouth of the River Lena, uses this language:\r\n'Large quantities of ivory are dug out of the ground every year. Indeed,\r\nsome of the islands are believed to be nothing but an accumulation of\r\ndrift-timber and the bodies of mammoths and other antediluvian animals\r\nfrozen together.' From this we may infer that, during the years that\r\nhave elapsed since the Russian conquest of Siberia, useful tusks from\r\nmore than twenty thousand mammoths have been collected.\"\r\n\r\nBut now for the story of Olaf Jansen. I give it in detail, as set down\r\nby himself in manuscript, and woven into the tale, just as he placed\r\nthem, are certain quotations from recent works on Arctic exploration,\r\nshowing how carefully the old Norseman compared with his own experiences\r\nthose of other voyagers to the frozen North. Thus wrote the disciple of\r\nOdin and Thor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO. OLAF JANSEN'S STORY\r\n\r\nMY name is Olaf Jansen. I am a Norwegian, although I was born in the\r\nlittle seafaring Russian town of Uleaborg, on the eastern coast of the\r\nGulf of Bothnia, the northern arm of the Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\nMy parents were on a fishing cruise in the Gulf of Bothnia, and put\r\ninto this Russian town of Uleaborg at the time of my birth, being the\r\ntwenty-seventh day of October, 1811.\r\n\r\nMy father, Jens Jansen, was born at Rodwig on the Scandinavian coast,\r\nnear the Lofoden Islands, but after marrying made his home at Stockholm,\r\nbecause my mother's people resided in that city. When seven years old,\r\nI began going with my father on his fishing trips along the Scandinavian\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nEarly in life I displayed an aptitude for books, and at the age of nine\r\nyears was placed in a private school in Stockholm, remaining there until\r\nI was fourteen. After this I made regular trips with my father on all\r\nhis fishing voyages.\r\n\r\nMy father was a man fully six feet three in height, and weighed over\r\nfifteen stone, a typical Norseman of the most rugged sort, and capable\r\nof more endurance than any other man I have ever known. He possessed the\r\ngentleness of a woman in tender little ways, yet his determination and\r\nwill-power were beyond description. His will admitted of no defeat.\r\n\r\nI was in my nineteenth year when we started on what proved to be our\r\nlast trip as fishermen, and which resulted in the strange story that\r\nshall be given to the world,--but not until I have finished my earthly\r\npilgrimage.\r\n\r\nI dare not allow the facts as I know them to be published while I am\r\nliving, for fear of further humiliation, confinement and suffering.\r\nFirst of all, I was put in irons by the captain of the whaling vessel\r\nthat rescued me, for no other reason than that I told the truth about\r\nthe marvelous discoveries made by my father and myself. But this was far\r\nfrom being the end of my tortures.\r\n\r\nAfter four years and eight months' absence I reached Stockholm, only to\r\nfind my mother had died the previous year, and the property left by my\r\nparents in the possession of my mother's people, but it was at once made\r\nover to me.\r\n\r\nAll might have been well, had I erased from my memory the story of our\r\nadventure and of my father's terrible death.\r\n\r\nFinally, one day I told the story in detail to my uncle, Gustaf\r\nOsterlind, a man of considerable property, and urged him to fit out an\r\nexpedition for me to make another voyage to the strange land.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought he favored my project. He seemed interested, and\r\ninvited me to go before certain officials and explain to them, as I\r\nhad to him, the story of our travels and discoveries. Imagine my\r\ndisappointment and horror when, upon the conclusion of my narrative,\r\ncertain papers were signed by my uncle, and, without warning, I found\r\nmyself arrested and hurried away to dismal and fearful confinement in\r\na madhouse, where I remained for twenty-eight years--long, tedious,\r\nfrightful years of suffering!\r\n\r\nI never ceased to assert my sanity, and to protest against the injustice\r\nof my confinement. Finally, on the seventeenth of October, 1862, I\r\nwas released. My uncle was dead, and the friends of my youth were now\r\nstrangers. Indeed, a man over fifty years old, whose only known record\r\nis that of a madman, has no friends.\r\n\r\nI was at a loss to know what to do for a living, but instinctively\r\nturned toward the harbor where fishing boats in great numbers were\r\nanchored, and within a week I had shipped with a fisherman by the name\r\nof Yan Hansen, who was starting on a long fishing cruise to the Lofoden\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nHere my earlier years of training proved of the very greatest advantage,\r\nespecially in enabling me to make myself useful. This was but the\r\nbeginning of other trips, and by frugal economy I was, in a few years,\r\nable to own a fishing-brig of my own. For twenty-seven years thereafter\r\nI followed the sea as a fisherman, five years working for others, and\r\nthe last twenty-two for myself.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years I was a most diligent student of books, as well\r\nas a hard worker at my business, but I took great care not to mention\r\nto anyone the story concerning the discoveries made by my father and\r\nmyself. Even at this late day I would be fearful of having any one see\r\nor know the things I am writing, and the records and maps I have in\r\nmy keeping. When my days on earth are finished, I shall leave maps and\r\nrecords that will enlighten and, I hope, benefit mankind.\r\n\r\nThe memory of my long confinement with maniacs, and all the horrible\r\nanguish and sufferings are too vivid to warrant my taking further\r\nchances.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 I sold out my fishing boats, and found I had accumulated a\r\nfortune quite sufficient to keep me the remainder of my life. I then\r\ncame to America.\r\n\r\nFor a dozen years my home was in Illinois, near Batavia, where I\r\ngathered most of the books in my present library, though I brought many\r\nchoice volumes from Stockholm. Later, I came to Los Angeles, arriving\r\nhere March 4, 1901. The date I well remember, as it was President\r\nMcKinley's second inauguration day. I bought this humble home and\r\ndetermined, here in the privacy of my own abode, sheltered by my own\r\nvine and fig-tree, and with my books about me, to make maps and drawings\r\nof the new lands we had discovered, and also to write the story in\r\ndetail from the time my father and I left Stockholm until the tragic\r\nevent that parted us in the Antarctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nI well remember that we left Stockholm in our fishing-sloop on the third\r\nday of April, 1829, and sailed to the southward, leaving Gothland\r\nIsland to the left and Oeland Island to the right. A few days later we\r\nsucceeded in doubling Sandhommar Point, and made our way through the\r\nsound which separates Denmark from the Scandinavian coast. In due time\r\nwe put in at the town of Christiansand, where we rested two days, and\r\nthen started around the Scandinavian coast to the westward, bound for\r\nthe Lofoden Islands.\r\n\r\nMy father was in high spirit, because of the excellent and gratifying\r\nreturns he had received from our last catch by marketing at Stockholm,\r\ninstead of selling at one of the seafaring towns along the Scandinavian\r\ncoast. He was especially pleased with the sale of some ivory tusks that\r\nhe had found on the west coast of Franz Joseph Land during one of his\r\nnorthern cruises the previous year, and he expressed the hope that this\r\ntime we might again be fortunate enough to load our little fishing-sloop\r\nwith ivory, instead of cod, herring, mackerel and salmon.\r\n\r\nWe put in at Hammerfest, latitude seventy-one degrees and forty minutes,\r\nfor a few days' rest. Here we remained one week, laying in an extra\r\nsupply of provisions and several casks of drinking-water, and then\r\nsailed toward Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days we had an open sea and a favoring wind, and then\r\nwe encountered much ice and many icebergs. A vessel larger than our\r\nlittle fishing-sloop could not possibly have threaded its way among\r\nthe labyrinth of icebergs or squeezed through the barely open channels.\r\nThese monster bergs presented an endless succession of crystal\r\npalaces, of massive cathedrals and fantastic mountain ranges, grim and\r\nsentinel-like, immovable as some towering cliff of solid rock, standing;\r\nsilent as a sphinx, resisting the restless waves of a fretful sea.\r\n\r\nAfter many narrow escapes, we arrived at Spitzbergen on the 23d of\r\nJune, and anchored at Wijade Bay for a short time, where we were quite\r\nsuccessful in our catches. We then lifted anchor and sailed through the\r\nHinlopen Strait, and coasted along the North-East-Land.(2)\r\n\r\n(2 It will be remembered that Andree started on his fatal balloon voyage\r\nfrom the northwest coast of Spitzbergen.)\r\n\r\nA strong wind came up from the southwest, and my father said that we had\r\nbetter take advantage of it and try to reach Franz Josef Land, where,\r\nthe year before he had, by accident, found the ivory tusks that had\r\nbrought him such a good price at Stockholm.\r\n\r\nNever, before or since, have I seen so many sea-fowl; they were so\r\nnumerous that they hid the rocks on the coast line and darkened the sky.\r\n\r\nFor several days we sailed along the rocky coast of Franz Josef Land.\r\nFinally, a favoring wind came up that enabled us to make the West Coast,\r\nand, after sailing twenty-four hours, we came to a beautiful inlet.\r\n\r\nOne could hardly believe it was the far Northland. The place was green\r\nwith growing vegetation, and while the area did not comprise more than\r\none or two acres, yet the air was warm and tranquil. It seemed to be at\r\nthat point where the Gulf Stream's influence is most keenly felt.(3)\r\n\r\n(3 Sir John Barrow, Bart., F.R.S., in his work entitled \"Voyages of\r\nDiscovery and Research Within the Arctic Regions,\" says on page 57:\r\n\"Mr. Beechey refers to what has frequently been found and noticed--the\r\nmildness of the temperature on the western coast of Spitzbergen, there\r\nbeing little or no sensation of cold, though the thermometer might be\r\nonly a few degrees above the freezing-point. The brilliant and lively\r\neffect of a clear day, when the sun shines forth with a pure sky, whose\r\nazure hue is so intense as to find no parallel even in the boasted\r\nItalian sky.\")\r\n\r\nOn the east coast there were numerous icebergs, yet here we were in open\r\nwater. Far to the west of us, however, were icepacks, and still farther\r\nto the westward the ice appeared like ranges of low hills. In front of\r\nus, and directly to the north, lay an open sea.(4)\r\n\r\n(4 Captain Kane, on page 299, quoting from Morton's Journal on Monday,\r\nthe 26th of December, says: \"As far as I could see, the open passages\r\nwere fifteen miles or more wide, with sometimes mashed ice separating\r\nthem. But it is all small ice, and I think it either drives out to the\r\nopen space to the north or rots and sinks, as I could see none ahead to\r\nthe north.\")\r\n\r\nMy father was an ardent believer in Odin and Thor, and had frequently\r\ntold me they were gods who came from far beyond the \"North Wind.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a tradition, my father explained, that still farther northward\r\nwas a land more beautiful than any that mortal man had ever known, and\r\nthat it was inhabited by the \"Chosen.\"(5)\r\n\r\n(5 We find the following in \"Deutsche Mythologie,\" page 778, from the\r\npen of Jakob Grimm; \"Then, the sons of Bor built in the middle of the\r\nuniverse the city called Asgard, where dwell the gods and their kindred,\r\nand from that abode work out so many wondrous things both on the earth\r\nand in the heavens above it. There is in that city a place called\r\nIllidskjalf, and when Odin is seated there upon his lofty throne he sees\r\nover the whole world and discerns all the actions of men.\")\r\n\r\nMy youthful imagination was fired by the ardor, zeal and religious\r\nfervor of my good father, and I exclaimed: \"Why not sail to this goodly\r\nland? The sky is fair, the wind favorable and the sea open.\"\r\n\r\nEven now I can see the expression of pleasurable surprise on his\r\ncountenance as he turned toward me and asked: \"My son, are you\r\nwilling to go with me and explore--to go far beyond where man has ever\r\nventured?\" I answered affirmatively. \"Very well,\" he replied. \"May the\r\ngod Odin protect us!\" and, quickly adjusting the sails, he glanced at\r\nour compass, turned the prow in due northerly direction through an open\r\nchannel, and our voyage had begun.(6)\r\n\r\n(6 Hall writes, on page 288: \"On the 23rd of January the two Esquimaux,\r\naccompanied by two of the seamen, went to Cape Lupton. They reported a\r\nsea of open water extending as far as the eye could reach.\")\r\n\r\nThe sun was low in the horizon, as it was still the early summer.\r\nIndeed, we had almost four months of day ahead of us before the frozen\r\nnight could come on again.\r\n\r\nOur little fishing-sloop sprang forward as if eager as ourselves for\r\nadventure. Within thirty-six hours we were out of sight of the highest\r\npoint on the coast line of Franz Josef Land. We seemed to be in a\r\nstrong current running north by northeast. Far to the right and to the\r\nleft of us were icebergs, but our little sloop bore down on the narrows\r\nand passed through channels and out into open seas--channels so narrow\r\nin places that, had our craft been other than small, we never could have\r\ngotten through.\r\n\r\nOn the third day we came to an island. Its shores were washed by an open\r\nsea. My father determined to land and explore for a day. This new land\r\nwas destitute of timber, but we found a large accumulation of drift-wood\r\non the northern shore. Some of the trunks of the trees were forty feet\r\nlong and two feet in diameter.(7)\r\n\r\n(7 Greely tells us in vol. 1, page 100, that: \"Privates Connell and\r\nFrederick found a large coniferous tree on the beach, just above the\r\nextreme high-water mark. It was nearly thirty inches in circumference,\r\nsome thirty feet long, and had apparently been carried to that point\r\nby a current within a couple of years. A portion of it was cut up for\r\nfire-wood, and for the first time in that valley, a bright, cheery\r\ncamp-fire gave comfort to man.\")\r\n\r\nAfter one day's exploration of the coast line of this island, we lifted\r\nanchor and turned our prow to the north in an open sea.(8)\r\n\r\n(8 Dr. Kane says, on page 379 of his works: \"I cannot imagine what\r\nbecomes of the ice. A strong current sets in constantly to the north;\r\nbut, from altitudes of more than five hundred feet, I saw only narrow\r\nstrips of ice, with great spaces of open water, from ten to fifteen\r\nmiles in breadth, between them. It must, therefore, either go to an open\r\nspace in the north, or dissolve.\")\r\n\r\nI remember that neither my father nor myself had tasted food for almost\r\nthirty hours. Perhaps this was because of the tension of excitement\r\nabout our strange voyage in waters farther north, my father said, than\r\nanyone had ever before been. Active mentality had dulled the demands of\r\nthe physical needs.\r\n\r\nInstead of the cold being intense as we had anticipated, it was really\r\nwarmer and more pleasant than it had been while in Hammerfest on the\r\nnorth coast of Norway, some six weeks before.(9)\r\n\r\n(9 Captain Peary's second voyage relates another circumstance which may\r\nserve to confirm a conjecture which has long been maintained by some,\r\nthat an open sea, free of ice, exists at or near the Pole. \"On the\r\nsecond of November,\" says Peary, \"the wind freshened up to a gale from\r\nnorth by west, lowered the thermometer before midnight to 5 degrees,\r\nwhereas, a rise of wind at Melville Island was generally accompanied\r\nby a simultaneous rise in the thermometer at low temperatures. May not\r\nthis,\" he asks, \"be occasioned by the wind blowing over an open sea in\r\nthe quarter from which the wind blows? And tend to confirm the opinion\r\nthat at or near the Pole an open sea exists?\")\r\n\r\nWe both frankly admitted that we were very hungry, and forthwith I\r\nprepared a substantial meal from our well-stored larder. When we had\r\npartaken heartily of the repast, I told my father I believed I would\r\nsleep, as I was beginning to feel quite drowsy. \"Very well,\" he replied,\r\n\"I will keep the watch.\"\r\n\r\nI have no way to determine how long I slept; I only know that I was\r\nrudely awakened by a terrible commotion of the sloop. To my surprise,\r\nI found my father sleeping soundly. I cried out lustily to him, and\r\nstarting up, he sprang quickly to his feet. Indeed, had he not instantly\r\nclutched the rail, he would certainly have been thrown into the seething\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nA fierce snow-storm was raging. The wind was directly astern, driving\r\nour sloop at a terrific speed, and was threatening every moment to\r\ncapsize us. There was no time to lose, the sails had to be lowered\r\nimmediately. Our boat was writhing in convulsions. A few icebergs we\r\nknew were on either side of us, but fortunately the channel was open\r\ndirectly to the north. But would it remain so? In front of us, girding\r\nthe horizon from left to right, was a vaporish fog or mist, black as\r\nEgyptian night at the water's edge, and white like a steam-cloud toward\r\nthe top, which was finally lost to view as it blended with the great\r\nwhite flakes of falling snow. Whether it covered a treacherous iceberg,\r\nor some other hidden obstacle against which our little sloop would dash\r\nand send us to a watery grave, or was merely the phenomenon of an Arctic\r\nfog, there was no way to determine.(10)\r\n\r\n(10 On page 284 of his works, Hall writes: \"From the top of Providence\r\nBerg, a dark fog was seen to the north, indicating water. At 10 a. m.\r\nthree of the men (Kruger, Nindemann and Hobby) went to Cape Lupton to\r\nascertain if possible the extent of the open water. On their return they\r\nreported several open spaces and much young ice--not more than a day\r\nold, so thin that it was easily broken by throwing pieces of ice upon\r\nit.\")\r\n\r\nBy what miracle we escaped being dashed to utter destruction, I do not\r\nknow. I remember our little craft creaked and groaned, as if its joints\r\nwere breaking. It rocked and staggered to and fro as if clutched by some\r\nfierce undertow of whirlpool or maelstrom.\r\n\r\nFortunately our compass had been fastened with long screws to a\r\ncrossbeam. Most of our provisions, however, were tumbled out and swept\r\naway from the deck of the cuddy, and had we not taken the precaution at\r\nthe very beginning to tie ourselves firmly to the masts of the sloop, we\r\nshould have been swept into the lashing sea.\r\n\r\nAbove the deafening tumult of the raging waves, I heard my father's\r\nvoice. \"Be courageous, my son,\" he shouted, \"Odin is the god of the\r\nwaters, the companion of the brave, and he is with us. Fear not.\"\r\n\r\nTo me it seemed there was no possibility of our escaping a horrible\r\ndeath. The little sloop was shipping water, the snow was falling so\r\nfast as to be blinding, and the waves were tumbling over our counters in\r\nreckless white-sprayed fury. There was no telling what instant we should\r\nbe dashed against some drifting ice-pack. The tremendous swells would\r\nheave us up to the very peaks of mountainous waves, then plunge us\r\ndown into the depths of the sea's trough as if our fishing-sloop were a\r\nfragile shell. Gigantic white-capped waves, like veritable walls, fenced\r\nus in, fore and aft.\r\n\r\nThis terrible nerve-racking ordeal, with its nameless horrors of\r\nsuspense and agony of fear indescribable, continued for more than three\r\nhours, and all the time we were being driven forward at fierce speed.\r\nThen suddenly, as if growing weary of its frantic exertions, the wind\r\nbegan to lessen its fury and by degrees to die down.\r\n\r\nAt last we were in a perfect calm. The fog mist had also disappeared,\r\nand before us lay an iceless channel perhaps ten or fifteen miles\r\nwide, with a few icebergs far away to our right, and an intermittent\r\narchipelago of smaller ones to the left.\r\n\r\nI watched my father closely, determined to remain silent until he spoke.\r\nPresently he untied the rope from his waist and, without saying a word,\r\nbegan working the pumps, which fortunately were not damaged, relieving\r\nthe sloop of the water it had shipped in the madness of the storm.\r\n\r\nHe put up the sloop's sails as calmly as if casting a fishing-net, and\r\nthen remarked that we were ready for a favoring wind when it came. His\r\ncourage and persistence were truly remarkable.\r\n\r\nOn investigation we found less than one-third of our provisions\r\nremaining, while to our utter dismay, we discovered that our water-casks\r\nhad been swept overboard during the violent plungings of our boat.\r\n\r\nTwo of our water-casks were in the main hold, but both were empty. We\r\nhad a fair supply of food, but no fresh water. I realized at once the\r\nawfulness of our position. Presently I was seized with a consuming\r\nthirst. \"It is indeed bad,\" remarked my father. \"However, let us dry\r\nour bedraggled clothing, for we are soaked to the skin. Trust to the god\r\nOdin, my son. Do not give up hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was beating down slantingly, as if we were in a southern\r\nlatitude, instead of in the far Northland. It was swinging around, its\r\norbit ever visible and rising higher and higher each day, frequently\r\nmist-covered, yet always peering through the lacework of clouds\r\nlike some fretful eye of fate, guarding the mysterious Northland and\r\njealously watching the pranks of man. Far to our right the rays decking\r\nthe prisms of icebergs were gorgeous. Their reflections emitted flashes\r\nof garnet, of diamond, of sapphire. A pyrotechnic panorama of countless\r\ncolors and shapes, while below could be seen the green-tinted sea, and\r\nabove, the purple sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE. BEYOND THE NORTH WIND\r\n\r\nI TRIED to forget my thirst by busying myself with bringing up some food\r\nand an empty vessel from the hold. Reaching over the side-rail, I filled\r\nthe vessel with water for the purpose of laving my hands and face. To my\r\nastonishment, when the water came in contact with my lips, I could taste\r\nno salt. I was startled by the discovery. \"Father!\" I fairly gasped,\r\n\"the water, the water; it is fresh!\" \"What, Olaf?\" exclaimed my father,\r\nglancing hastily around. \"Surely you are mistaken. There is no land. You\r\nare going mad.\" \"But taste it!\" I cried.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we made the discovery that the water was indeed fresh,\r\nabsolutely so, without the least briny taste or even the suspicion of a\r\nsalty flavor.\r\n\r\nWe forthwith filled our two remaining water-casks, and my father\r\ndeclared it was a heavenly dispensation of mercy from the gods Odin and\r\nThor.\r\n\r\nWe were almost beside ourselves with joy, but hunger bade us end our\r\nenforced fast. Now that we had found fresh water in the open sea, what\r\nmight we not expect in this strange latitude where ship had never before\r\nsailed and the splash of an oar had never been heard? (11)\r\n\r\n(11 In vol. I, page 196, Nansen writes: \"It is a peculiar\r\nphenomenon,--this dead water. We had at present a better opportunity of\r\nstudying it than we desired. It occurs where a surface layer of fresh\r\nwater rests upon the salt water of the sea, and this fresh water is\r\ncarried along with the ship gliding on the heavier sea beneath it as if\r\non a fixed foundation. The difference between the two strata was in this\r\ncase so great that while we had drinking water on the surface, the water\r\nwe got from the bottom cock of the engine-room was far too salt to be\r\nused for the boiler.\")\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely appeased our hunger when a breeze began filling the\r\nidle sails, and, glancing at the compass, we found the northern point\r\npressing hard against the glass.\r\n\r\nIn response to my surprise, my father said, \"I have heard of this\r\nbefore; it is what they call the dipping of the needle.\"\r\n\r\nWe loosened the compass and turned it at right angles with the surface\r\nof the sea before its point would free itself from the glass and point\r\naccording to unmolested attraction. It shifted uneasily, and seemed as\r\nunsteady as a drunken man, but finally pointed a course.\r\n\r\nBefore this we thought the wind was carrying us north by northwest, but,\r\nwith the needle free, we discovered, if it could be relied upon, that we\r\nwere sailing slightly north by northeast. Our course, however, was ever\r\ntending northward.(12)\r\n\r\n(12 In volume II, pages 18 and 19, Nansen writes about the inclination\r\nof the needle. Speaking of Johnson, his aide: \"One day--it was November\r\n24--he came in to supper a little after six o'clock, quite alarmed,\r\nand said: 'There has just been a singular inclination of the needle\r\nin twenty-four degrees. And remarkably enough, its northern extremity\r\npointed to the east.'\"\r\n\r\nWe again find in Peary's first voyage--page 67,--the following: \"It had\r\nbeen observed that from the moment they had entered Lancaster Sound, the\r\nmotion of the compass needle was very sluggish, and both this and its\r\ndeviation increased as they progressed to the westward, and continued to\r\ndo so in descending this inlet. Having reached latitude 73 degrees, they\r\nwitnessed for the first time the curious phenomenon of the directive\r\npower of the needle becoming so weak as to be completely overcome by the\r\nattraction of the ship, so that the needle might now be said to point to\r\nthe north pole of the ship.\")\r\n\r\nThe sea was serenely smooth, with hardly a choppy wave, and the wind\r\nbrisk and exhilarating. The sun's rays, while striking us aslant,\r\nfurnished tranquil warmth. And thus time wore on day after day, and we\r\nfound from the record in our logbook, we had been sailing eleven days\r\nsince the storm in the open sea.\r\n\r\nBy strictest economy, our food was holding out fairly well, but\r\nbeginning to run low. In the meantime, one of our casks of water had\r\nbeen exhausted, and my father said: \"We will fill it again.\" But, to\r\nour dismay, we found the water was now as salt as in the region of the\r\nLofoden Islands off the coast of Norway. This necessitated our being\r\nextremely careful of the remaining cask.\r\n\r\nI found myself wanting to sleep much of the time; whether it was the\r\neffect of the exciting experience of sailing in unknown waters, or the\r\nrelaxation from the awful excitement incident to our adventure in a\r\nstorm at sea, or due to want of food, I could not say.\r\n\r\nI frequently lay down on the bunker of our little sloop, and looked\r\nfar up into the blue dome of the sky; and, notwithstanding the sun was\r\nshining far away in the east, I always saw a single star overhead. For\r\nseveral days, when I looked for this star, it was always there directly\r\nabove us.\r\n\r\nIt was now, according to our reckoning, about the first of August. The\r\nsun was high in the heavens, and was so bright that I could no longer\r\nsee the one lone star that attracted my attention a few days earlier.\r\n\r\nOne day about this time, my father startled me by calling my attention\r\nto a novel sight far in front of us, almost at the horizon. \"It is a\r\nmock sun,\" exclaimed my father. \"I have read of them; it is called a\r\nreflection or mirage. It will soon pass away.\"\r\n\r\nBut this dull-red, false sun, as we supposed it to be, did not pass away\r\nfor several hours; and while we were unconscious of its emitting any\r\nrays of light, still there was no time thereafter when we could not\r\nsweep the horizon in front and locate the illumination of the so-called\r\nfalse sun, during a period of at least twelve hours out of every\r\ntwenty-four.\r\n\r\nClouds and mists would at times almost, but never entirely, hide its\r\nlocation. Gradually it seemed to climb higher in the horizon of the\r\nuncertain purply sky as we advanced.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be said to resemble the sun, except in its circular\r\nshape, and when not obscured by clouds or the ocean mists, it had a\r\nhazy-red, bronzed appearance, which would change to a white light like a\r\nluminous cloud, as if reflecting some greater light beyond.\r\n\r\nWe finally agreed in our discussion of this smoky furnace-colored sun,\r\nthat, whatever the cause of the phenomenon, it was not a reflection of\r\nour sun, but a planet of some sort--a reality.(13)\r\n\r\n(13 Nansen, on page 394, says: \"To-day another noteworthy thing\r\nhappened, which was that about mid-day we saw the sun, or to be more\r\ncorrect, an image of the sun, for it was only a mirage. A peculiar\r\nimpression was produced by the sight of that glowing fire lit just\r\nabove the outermost edge of the ice. According to the enthusiastic\r\ndescriptions given by many Arctic travelers of the first appearance of\r\nthis god of life after the long winter night, the impression ought to\r\nbe one of jubilant excitement; but it was not so in my case. We had not\r\nexpected to see it for some days yet, so that my feeling was rather one\r\nof pain, of disappointment that we must have drifted farther south than\r\nwe thought. So it was with pleasure I soon discovered that it could not\r\nbe the sun itself. The mirage was at first a flattened-out, glowing red,\r\nstreak of fire on the horizon; later there were two streaks, the one\r\nabove the other, with a dark space between; and from the maintop I could\r\nsee four, or even five, such horizontal lines directly over one another,\r\nall of equal length, as if one could only imagine a square, dull-red\r\nsun, with horizontal dark streaks across it.\")\r\n\r\nOne day soon after this, I felt exceedingly drowsy, and fell into a\r\nsound sleep. But it seemed that I was almost immediately aroused by\r\nmy father's vigorous shaking of me by the shoulder and saying: \"Olaf,\r\nawaken; there is land in sight!\"\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet, and oh! joy unspeakable! There, far in the\r\ndistance, yet directly in our path, were lands jutting boldly into the\r\nsea. The shore-line stretched far away to the right of us, as far as the\r\neye could see, and all along the sandy beach were waves breaking into\r\nchoppy foam, receding, then going forward again, ever chanting in\r\nmonotonous thunder tones the song of the deep. The banks were covered\r\nwith trees and vegetation.\r\n\r\nI cannot express my feeling of exultation at this discovery. My father\r\nstood motionless, with his hand on the tiller, looking straight ahead,\r\npouring out his heart in thankful prayer and thanksgiving to the gods\r\nOdin and Thor.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a net which we found in the stowage had been cast, and\r\nwe caught a few fish that materially added to our dwindling stock of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nThe compass, which we had fastened back in its place, in fear of another\r\nstorm, was still pointing due north, and moving on its pivot, just as it\r\nhad at Stockholm. The dipping of the needle had ceased. What could this\r\nmean? Then, too, our many days of sailing had certainly carried us far\r\npast the North Pole. And yet the needle continued to point north. We\r\nwere sorely perplexed, for surely our direction was now south.(14)\r\n\r\n(14 Peary's first voyage, pages 69 and 70, says:\r\n\r\n     \"On reaching Sir Byam Martin's Island, the nearest to\r\n     Melville Island, the latitude of the place of observation was\r\n     75 degrees - 09' - 23\", and the longitude 103\r\n     degrees - 44' - 37\"; the dip of the magnetic needle 88\r\n     degrees - 25' - 56\" west in the longitude of 91\r\n     degrees - 48', where the last observations on the shore\r\n     had been made, to 165 degrees - 50' - 09\", east, at\r\n     their present station, so that we had,\" says Peary, \"in sailing\r\n     over the space included between these two meridians, crossed\r\n     immediately northward of the magnetic pole, and had undoubtedly\r\n     passed over one of those spots upon the globe where the needle\r\n     would have been found to vary 180 degrees, or in other\r\n     words, where the North Pole would have pointed to the south.\")\r\n\r\nWe sailed for three days along the shoreline, then came to the mouth of\r\na fjord or river of immense size. It seemed more like a great bay, and\r\ninto this we turned our fishing-craft, the direction being slightly\r\nnortheast of south. By the assistance of a fretful wind that came to our\r\naid about twelve hours out of every twenty-four, we continued to make\r\nour way inland, into what afterward proved to be a mighty river, and\r\nwhich we learned was called by the inhabitants Hiddekel.\r\n\r\nWe continued our journey for ten days thereafter, and found we had\r\nfortunately attained a distance inland where ocean tides no longer\r\naffected the water, which had become fresh.\r\n\r\nThe discovery came none too soon, for our remaining cask of water was\r\nwell-nigh exhausted. We lost no time in replenishing our casks, and\r\ncontinued to sail farther up the river when the wind was favorable.\r\n\r\nAlong the banks great forests miles in extent could be seen stretching\r\naway on the shore-line. The trees were of enormous size. We landed after\r\nanchoring near a sandy beach, and waded ashore, and were rewarded by\r\nfinding a quantity of nuts that were very palatable and satisfying\r\nto hunger, and a welcome change from the monotony of our stock of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nIt was about the first of September, over five months, we calculated,\r\nsince our leave-taking from Stockholm. Suddenly we were frightened\r\nalmost out of our wits by hearing in the far distance the singing of\r\npeople. Very soon thereafter we discovered a huge ship gliding down the\r\nriver directly toward us. Those aboard were singing in one mighty chorus\r\nthat, echoing from bank to bank, sounded like a thousand voices, filling\r\nthe whole universe with quivering melody. The accompaniment was played\r\non stringed instruments not unlike our harps.\r\n\r\nIt was a larger ship than any we had ever seen, and was differently\r\nconstructed.(15)\r\n\r\n(15 Asiatic Mythology,--page 240, \"Paradise found\"--from translation\r\nby Sayce, in a book called \"Records of the Past,\" we were told of a\r\n\"dwelling\" which \"the gods created for\" the first human beings,--a\r\ndwelling in which they \"became great\" and \"increased in numbers,\" and\r\nthe location of which is described in words exactly corresponding\r\nto those of Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Eddaic and Aztecan literature;\r\nnamely, \"in the center of the earth.\"--Warren.)\r\n\r\nAt this particular time our sloop was becalmed, and not far from the\r\nshore. The bank of the river, covered with mammoth trees, rose up\r\nseveral hundred feet in beautiful fashion. We seemed to be on the edge\r\nof some primeval forest that doubtless stretched far inland.\r\n\r\nThe immense craft paused, and almost immediately a boat was lowered\r\nand six men of gigantic stature rowed to our little fishing-sloop. They\r\nspoke to us in a strange language. We knew from their manner,\r\nhowever, that they were not unfriendly. They talked a great deal among\r\nthemselves, and one of them laughed immoderately, as though in finding\r\nus a queer discovery had been made. One of them spied our compass, and\r\nit seemed to interest them more than any other part of our sloop.\r\n\r\nFinally, the leader motioned as if to ask whether we were willing to\r\nleave our craft to go on board their ship. \"What say you, my son?\" asked\r\nmy father. \"They cannot do any more than kill us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem to be kindly disposed,\" I replied, \"although what terrible\r\ngiants! They must be the select six of the kingdom's crack regiment.\r\nJust look at their great size.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may as well go willingly as be taken by force,\" said my father,\r\nsmiling, \"for they are certainly able to capture us.\" Thereupon he made\r\nknown, by signs, that we were ready to accompany them.\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes we were on board the ship, and half an hour later\r\nour little fishing-craft had been lifted bodily out of the water by a\r\nstrange sort of hook and tackle, and set on board as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nThere were several hundred people on board this, to us, mammoth ship,\r\nwhich we discovered was called \"The Naz,\" meaning, as we afterward\r\nlearned, \"Pleasure,\" or to give a more proper interpretation, \"Pleasure\r\nExcursion\" ship.\r\n\r\nIf my father and I were curiously observed by the ship's occupants, this\r\nstrange race of giants offered us an equal amount of wonderment.\r\n\r\nThere was not a single man aboard who would not have measured fully\r\ntwelve feet in height. They all wore full beards, not particularly\r\nlong, but seemingly short-cropped. They had mild and beautiful faces,\r\nexceedingly fair, with ruddy complexions. The hair and beard of some\r\nwere black, others sandy, and still others yellow. The captain, as we\r\ndesignated the dignitary in command of the great vessel, was fully a\r\nhead taller than any of his companions. The women averaged from ten\r\nto eleven feet in height. Their features were especially regular and\r\nrefined, while their complexion was of a most delicate tint heightened\r\nby a healthful glow.(16)\r\n\r\n(16 \"According to all procurable data, that spot at the era of man's\r\nappearance upon the stage was in the now lost 'Miocene continent,' which\r\nthen surrounded the Arctic Pole. That in that true, original Eden some\r\nof the early generations of men attained to a stature and longevity\r\nunequaled in any countries known to postdiluvian history is by no means\r\nscientifically incredible.\"--Wm. F. Warren, \"Paradise Found,\" p. 284.)\r\n\r\nBoth men and women seemed to possess that particular ease of manner\r\nwhich we deem a sign of good breeding, and, notwithstanding their huge\r\nstatures, there was nothing about them suggesting awkwardness. As I was\r\na lad in only my nineteenth year, I was doubtless looked upon as a true\r\nTom Thumb. My father's six feet three did not lift the top of his head\r\nabove the waist line of these people.\r\n\r\nEach one seemed to vie with the others in extending courtesies and\r\nshowing kindness to us, but all laughed heartily, I remember, when they\r\nhad to improvise chairs for my father and myself to sit at table.\r\nThey were richly attired in a costume peculiar to themselves, and very\r\nattractive. The men were clothed in handsomely embroidered tunics of\r\nsilk and satin and belted at the waist. They wore knee-breeches and\r\nstockings of a fine texture, while their feet were encased in sandals\r\nadorned with gold buckles. We early discovered that gold was one of\r\nthe most common metals known, and that it was used extensively in\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, neither my father nor myself felt the least bit\r\nof solicitude for our safety. \"We have come into our own,\" my father\r\nsaid to me. \"This is the fulfillment of the tradition told me by my\r\nfather and my father's father, and still back for many generations of\r\nour race. This is, assuredly, the land beyond the North Wind.\"\r\n\r\nWe seemed to make such an impression on the party that we were given\r\nspecially into the charge of one of the men, Jules Galdea, and his wife,\r\nfor the purpose of being educated in their language; and we, on our\r\npart, were just as eager to learn as they were to instruct.\r\n\r\nAt the captain's command, the vessel was swung cleverly about, and began\r\nretracing its course up the river. The machinery, while noiseless, was\r\nvery powerful.\r\n\r\nThe banks and trees on either side seemed to rush by. The ship's speed,\r\nat times, surpassed that of any railroad train on which I have ever\r\nridden, even here in America. It was wonderful.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we had lost sight of the sun's rays, but we found a\r\nradiance \"within\" emanating from the dull-red sun which had already\r\nattracted our attention, now giving out a white light seemingly from\r\na cloud-bank far away in front of us. It dispensed a greater light, I\r\nshould say, than two full moons on the clearest night.\r\n\r\nIn twelve hours this cloud of whiteness would pass out of sight as if\r\neclipsed, and the twelve hours following corresponded with our night.\r\nWe early learned that these strange people were worshipers of this great\r\ncloud of night. It was \"The Smoky God\" of the \"Inner World.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship was equipped with a mode of illumination which I now presume\r\nwas electricity, but neither my father nor myself were sufficiently\r\nskilled in mechanics to understand whence came the power to operate the\r\nship, or to maintain the soft beautiful lights that answered the same\r\npurpose of our present methods of lighting the streets of our cities,\r\nour houses and places of business.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, the time of which I write was the autumn of 1829,\r\nand we of the \"outside\" surface of the earth knew nothing then, so to\r\nspeak, of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe electrically surcharged condition of the air was a constant\r\nvitalizer. I never felt better in my life than during the two years my\r\nfather and I sojourned on the inside of the earth.\r\n\r\nTo resume my narrative of events; The ship on which we were sailing came\r\nto a stop two days after we had been taken on board. My father said as\r\nnearly as he could judge, we were directly under Stockholm or London.\r\nThe city we had reached was called \"Jehu,\" signifying a seaport town.\r\nThe houses were large and beautifully constructed, and quite uniform in\r\nappearance, yet without sameness. The principal occupation of the people\r\nappeared to be agriculture; the hillsides were covered with vineyards,\r\nwhile the valleys were devoted to the growing of grain.\r\n\r\nI never saw such a display of gold. It was everywhere. The door-casings\r\nwere inlaid and the tables were veneered with sheetings of gold. Domes\r\nof the public buildings were of gold. It was used most generously in the\r\nfinishings of the great temples of music.\r\n\r\nVegetation grew in lavish exuberance, and fruit of all kinds possessed\r\nthe most delicate flavor. Clusters of grapes four and five feet in\r\nlength, each grape as large as an orange, and apples larger than a man's\r\nhead typified the wonderful growth of all things on the \"inside\" of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe great redwood trees of California would be considered mere\r\nunderbrush compared with the giant forest trees extending for miles and\r\nmiles in all directions. In many directions along the foothills of the\r\nmountains vast herds of cattle were seen during the last day of our\r\ntravel on the river.\r\n\r\nWe heard much of a city called \"Eden,\" but were kept at \"Jehu\" for an\r\nentire year. By the end of that time we had learned to speak fairly\r\nwell the language of this strange race of people. Our instructors, Jules\r\nGaldea and his wife, exhibited a patience that was truly commendable.\r\n\r\nOne day an envoy from the Ruler at \"Eden\" came to see us, and for two\r\nwhole days my father and myself were put through a series of surprising\r\nquestions. They wished to know from whence we came, what sort of people\r\ndwelt \"without,\" what God we worshiped, our religious beliefs, the mode\r\nof living in our strange land, and a thousand other things.\r\n\r\nThe compass which we had brought with us attracted especial attention.\r\nMy father and I commented between ourselves on the fact that the compass\r\nstill pointed north, although we now knew that we had sailed over the\r\ncurve or edge of the earth's aperture, and were far along southward\r\non the \"inside\" surface of the earth's crust, which, according to my\r\nfather's estimate and my own, is about three hundred miles in thickness\r\nfrom the \"inside\" to the \"outside\" surface. Relatively speaking, it is\r\nno thicker than an egg-shell, so that there is almost as much surface on\r\nthe \"inside\" as on the \"outside\" of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe great luminous cloud or ball of dull-red fire--fiery-red in the\r\nmornings and evenings, and during the day giving off a beautiful white\r\nlight, \"The Smoky God,\"--is seemingly suspended in the center of the\r\ngreat vacuum \"within\" the earth, and held to its place by the immutable\r\nlaw of gravitation, or a repellant atmospheric force, as the case may\r\nbe. I refer to the known power that draws or repels with equal force in\r\nall directions.\r\n\r\nThe base of this electrical cloud or central luminary, the seat of the\r\ngods, is dark and non-transparent, save for innumerable small openings,\r\nseemingly in the bottom of the great support or altar of the Deity, upon\r\nwhich \"The Smoky God\" rests; and, the lights shining through these many\r\nopenings twinkle at night in all their splendor, and seem to be stars,\r\nas natural as the stars we saw shining when in our home at Stockholm,\r\nexcepting that they appear larger. \"The Smoky God,\" therefore, with each\r\ndaily revolution of the earth, appears to come up in the east and go\r\ndown in the west, the same as does our sun on the external surface. In\r\nreality, the people \"within\" believe that \"The Smoky God\" is the throne\r\nof their Jehovah, and is stationary. The effect of night and day is,\r\ntherefore, produced by the earth's daily rotation.\r\n\r\nI have since discovered that the language of the people of the Inner\r\nWorld is much like the Sanskrit.\r\n\r\nAfter we had given an account of ourselves to the emissaries from the\r\ncentral seat of government of the inner continent, and my father had, in\r\nhis crude way, drawn maps, at their request, of the \"outside\" surface of\r\nthe earth, showing the divisions of land and water, and giving the name\r\nof each of the continents, large islands and the oceans, we were taken\r\noverland to the city of \"Eden,\" in a conveyance different from anything\r\nwe have in Europe or America. This vehicle was doubtless some electrical\r\ncontrivance. It was noiseless, and ran on a single iron rail in perfect\r\nbalance. The trip was made at a very high rate of speed. We were carried\r\nup hills and down dales, across valleys and again along the sides of\r\nsteep mountains, without any apparent attempt having been made to level\r\nthe earth as we do for railroad tracks. The car seats were huge yet\r\ncomfortable affairs, and very high above the floor of the car. On the\r\ntop of each car were high geared fly wheels lying on their sides, which\r\nwere so automatically adjusted that, as the speed of the car increased,\r\nthe high speed of these fly wheels geometrically increased. Jules Galdea\r\nexplained to us that these revolving fan-like wheels on top of the cars\r\ndestroyed atmospheric pressure, or what is generally understood by\r\nthe term gravitation, and with this force thus destroyed or rendered\r\nnugatory the car is as safe from falling to one side or the other from\r\nthe single rail track as if it were in a vacuum; the fly wheels in\r\ntheir rapid revolutions destroying effectually the so-called power of\r\ngravitation, or the force of atmospheric pressure or whatever potent\r\ninfluence it may be that causes all unsupported things to fall downward\r\nto the earth's surface or to the nearest point of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe surprise of my father and myself was indescribable when, amid the\r\nregal magnificence of a spacious hall, we were finally brought before\r\nthe Great High Priest, ruler over all the land. He was richly robed,\r\nand much taller than those about him, and could not have been less than\r\nfourteen or fifteen feet in height. The immense room in which we were\r\nreceived seemed finished in solid slabs of gold thickly studded with\r\njewels, of amazing brilliancy.\r\n\r\nThe city of \"Eden\" is located in what seems to be a beautiful valley,\r\nyet, in fact, it is on the loftiest mountain plateau of the Inner\r\nContinent, several thousand feet higher than any portion of the\r\nsurrounding country. It is the most beautiful place I have ever beheld\r\nin all my travels. In this elevated garden all manner of fruits, vines,\r\nshrubs, trees, and flowers grow in riotous profusion.\r\n\r\nIn this garden four rivers have their source in a mighty artesian\r\nfountain. They divide and flow in four directions. This place is called\r\nby the inhabitants the \"navel of the earth,\" or the beginning, \"the\r\ncradle of the human race.\" The names of the rivers are the Euphrates,\r\nthe Pison, the Gihon, and the Hiddekel.(17)\r\n\r\n(17 \"And the Lord God planted a garden, and out of the ground made the\r\nLord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for\r\nfood.\"--The Book of Genesis.)\r\n\r\nThe unexpected awaited us in this palace of beauty, in the finding of\r\nour little fishing-craft. It had been brought before the High Priest in\r\nperfect shape, just as it had been taken from the waters that day when\r\nit was loaded on board the ship by the people who discovered us on the\r\nriver more than a year before.\r\n\r\nWe were given an audience of over two hours with this great dignitary,\r\nwho seemed kindly disposed and considerate. He showed himself eagerly\r\ninterested, asking us numerous questions, and invariably regarding\r\nthings about which his emissaries had failed to inquire.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the interview he inquired our pleasure, asking us\r\nwhether we wished to remain in his country or if we preferred to return\r\nto the \"outer\" world, providing it were possible to make a successful\r\nreturn trip, across the frozen belt barriers that encircle both the\r\nnorthern and southern openings of the earth.\r\n\r\nMy father replied: \"It would please me and my son to visit your country\r\nand see your people, your colleges and palaces of music and art, your\r\ngreat fields, your wonderful forests of timber; and after we have had\r\nthis pleasurable privilege, we should like to try to return to our home\r\non the 'outside' surface of the earth. This son is my only child, and my\r\ngood wife will be weary awaiting our return.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear you can never return,\" replied the Chief High Priest, \"because\r\nthe way is a most hazardous one. However, you shall visit the different\r\ncountries with Jules Galdea as your escort, and be accorded every\r\ncourtesy and kindness. Whenever you are ready to attempt a return\r\nvoyage, I assure you that your boat which is here on exhibition shall\r\nbe put in the waters of the river Hiddekel at its mouth, and we will bid\r\nyou Jehovah-speed.\"\r\n\r\nThus terminated our only interview with the High Priest or Ruler of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\nIN THE UNDER WORLD\r\n\r\nWE learned that the males do not marry before they are from seventy-five\r\nto one hundred years old, and that the age at which women enter wedlock\r\nis only a little less, and that both men and women frequently live to\r\nbe from six to eight hundred years old, and in some instances much\r\nolder.(18)\r\n\r\n(18 Josephus says: \"God prolonged the life of the patriarchs that\r\npreceded the deluge, both on account of their virtues and to give them\r\nthe opportunity of perfecting the sciences of geometry and astronomy,\r\nwhich they had discovered; which they could not have done if they had\r\nnot lived 600 years, because it is only after the lapse of 600 years\r\nthat the great year is accomplished.\"--Flammarion, Astronomical Myths,\r\nParis p. 26.)\r\n\r\nDuring the following year we visited many villages and towns, prominent\r\namong them being the cities of Nigi, Delfi, Hectea, and my father was\r\ncalled upon no less than a half-dozen times to go over the maps which\r\nhad been made from the rough sketches he had originally given of the\r\ndivisions of land and water on the \"outside\" surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing my father remark that the giant race of people in the\r\nland of \"The Smoky God\" had almost as accurate an idea of the geography\r\nof the \"outside\" surface of the earth as had the average college\r\nprofessor in Stockholm.\r\n\r\nIn our travels we came to a forest of gigantic trees, near the city of\r\nDelfi. Had the Bible said there were trees towering over three hundred\r\nfeet in height, and more than thirty feet in diameter, growing in the\r\nGarden of Eden, the Ingersolls, the Tom Paines and Voltaires would\r\ndoubtless have pronounced the statement a myth. Yet this is the\r\ndescription of the California sequoia gigantea; but these California\r\ngiants pale into insignificance when compared with the forest Goliaths\r\nfound in the \"within\" continent, where abound mighty trees from eight\r\nhundred to one thousand feet in height, and from one hundred to one\r\nhundred and twenty feet in diameter; countless in numbers and forming\r\nforests extending hundreds of miles back from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe people are exceedingly musical, and learned to a remarkable degree\r\nin their arts and sciences, especially geometry and astronomy. Their\r\ncities are equipped with vast palaces of music, where not infrequently\r\nas many as twenty-five thousand lusty voices of this giant race swell\r\nforth in mighty choruses of the most sublime symphonies.\r\n\r\nThe children are not supposed to attend institutions of learning before\r\nthey are twenty years old. Then their school life begins and continues\r\nfor thirty years, ten of which are uniformly devoted by both sexes to\r\nthe study of music.\r\n\r\nTheir principal vocations are architecture, agriculture, horticulture,\r\nthe raising of vast herds of cattle, and the building of conveyances\r\npeculiar to that country, for travel on land and water. By some device\r\nwhich I cannot explain, they hold communion with one another between the\r\nmost distant parts of their country, on air currents.\r\n\r\nAll buildings are erected with special regard to strength, durability,\r\nbeauty and symmetry, and with a style of architecture vastly more\r\nattractive to the eye than any I have ever observed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAbout three-fourths of the \"inner\" surface of the earth is land and\r\nabout one-fourth water. There are numerous rivers of tremendous size,\r\nsome flowing in a northerly direction and others southerly. Some of\r\nthese rivers are thirty miles in width, and it is out of these vast\r\nwaterways, at the extreme northern and southern parts of the \"inside\"\r\nsurface of the earth, in regions where low temperatures are experienced,\r\nthat fresh-water icebergs are formed. They are then pushed out to sea\r\nlike huge tongues of ice, by the abnormal freshets of turbulent waters\r\nthat, twice every year, sweep everything before them.\r\n\r\nWe saw innumerable specimens of bird-life no larger than those\r\nencountered in the forests of Europe or America. It is well known that\r\nduring the last few years whole species of birds have quit the earth. A\r\nwriter in a recent article on this subject says:(19)\r\n\r\n(19 \"Almost every year sees the final extinction of one or more bird\r\nspecies. Out of fourteen varieties of birds found a century since on a\r\nsingle island--the West Indian island of St. Thomas--eight have now to\r\nbe numbered among the missing.\")\r\n\r\nIs it not possible that these disappearing bird species quit their\r\nhabitation without, and find an asylum in the \"within world\"?\r\n\r\nWhether inland among the mountains, or along the seashore, we found\r\nbird life prolific. When they spread their great wings some of the\r\nbirds appeared to measure thirty feet from tip to tip. They are of great\r\nvariety and many colors. We were permitted to climb up on the edge of\r\na rock and examine a nest of eggs. There were five in the nest, each of\r\nwhich was at least two feet in length and fifteen inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been in the city of Hectea about a week, Professor Galdea\r\ntook us to an inlet, where we saw thousands of tortoises along the sandy\r\nshore. I hesitate to state the size of these great creatures. They were\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty feet in length, from fifteen to twenty feet\r\nin width and fully seven feet in height. When one of them projected its\r\nhead it had the appearance of some hideous sea monster.\r\n\r\nThe strange conditions \"within\" are favorable not only for vast\r\nmeadows of luxuriant grasses, forests of giant trees, and all manner of\r\nvegetable life, but wonderful animal life as well.\r\n\r\nOne day we saw a great herd of elephants. There must have been five\r\nhundred of these thunder-throated monsters, with their restlessly waving\r\ntrunks. They were tearing huge boughs from the trees and trampling\r\nsmaller growth into dust like so much hazel-brush. They would average\r\nover 100 feet in length and from 75 to 85 in height.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, as I gazed upon this wonderful herd of giant elephants, that\r\nI was again living in the public library at Stockholm, where I had spent\r\nmuch time studying the wonders of the Miocene age. I was filled with\r\nmute astonishment, and my father was speechless with awe. He held my arm\r\nwith a protecting grip, as if fearful harm would overtake us. We were\r\ntwo atoms in this great forest, and, fortunately, unobserved by this\r\nvast herd of elephants as they drifted on and away, following a leader\r\nas does a herd of sheep. They browsed from growing herbage which they\r\nencountered as they traveled, and now and again shook the firmament with\r\ntheir deep bellowing.(20)\r\n\r\n(20 \"Moreover, there were a great number of elephants in the island: and\r\nthere was provision for animals of every kind. Also whatever fragrant\r\nthings there are in the earth, whether roots or herbage, or woods,\r\nor distilling drops of flowers or fruits, grew and thrived in that\r\nland.\"--The Cratylus of Plato.)\r\n\r\nThere is a hazy mist that goes up from the land each evening, and it\r\ninvariably rains once every twenty-four hours. This great moisture and\r\nthe invigorating electrical light and warmth account perhaps for the\r\nluxuriant vegetation, while the highly charged electrical air and the\r\nevenness of climatic conditions may have much to do with the giant\r\ngrowth and longevity of all animal life.\r\n\r\nIn places the level valleys stretched away for many miles in every\r\ndirection. \"The Smoky God,\" in its clear white light, looked calmly\r\ndown. There was an intoxication in the electrically surcharged air that\r\nfanned the cheek as softly as a vanishing whisper. Nature chanted a\r\nlullaby in the faint murmur of winds whose breath was sweet with the\r\nfragrance of bud and blossom.\r\n\r\nAfter having spent considerably more than a year in visiting several of\r\nthe many cities of the \"within\" world and a great deal of intervening\r\ncountry, and more than two years had passed from the time we had been\r\npicked up by the great excursion ship on the river, we decided to\r\ncast our fortunes once more upon the sea, and endeavor to regain the\r\n\"outside\" surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe made known our wishes, and they were reluctantly but promptly\r\nfollowed. Our hosts gave my father, at his request, various maps showing\r\nthe entire \"inside\" surface of the earth, its cities, oceans, seas,\r\nrivers, gulfs and bays. They also generously offered to give us all the\r\nbags of gold nuggets--some of them as large as a goose's egg--that we\r\nwere willing to attempt to take with us in our little fishing-boat.\r\n\r\nIn due time we returned to Jehu, at which place we spent one month in\r\nfixing up and overhauling our little fishing sloop. After all was in\r\nreadiness, the same ship \"Naz\" that originally discovered us, took us on\r\nboard and sailed to the mouth of the river Hiddekel.\r\n\r\nAfter our giant brothers had launched our little craft for us, they were\r\nmost cordially regretful at parting, and evinced much solicitude for our\r\nsafety. My father swore by the Gods Odin and Thor that he would surely\r\nreturn again within a year or two and pay them another visit. And thus\r\nwe bade them adieu. We made ready and hoisted our sail, but there was\r\nlittle breeze. We were becalmed within an hour after our giant friends\r\nhad left us and started on their return trip.\r\n\r\nThe winds were constantly blowing south, that is, they were blowing from\r\nthe northern opening of the earth toward that which we knew to be south,\r\nbut which, according to our compass's pointing finger, was directly\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nFor three days we tried to sail, and to beat against the wind, but to no\r\navail. Whereupon my father said: \"My son, to return by the same route as\r\nwe came in is impossible at this time of year. I wonder why we did not\r\nthink of this before. We have been here almost two and a half years;\r\ntherefore, this is the season when the sun is beginning to shine in\r\nat the southern opening of the earth. The long cold night is on in the\r\nSpitzbergen country.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one thing we can do,\" my father replied, \"and that is to\r\ngo south.\" Accordingly, he turned the craft about, gave it full reef,\r\nand started by the compass north but, in fact, directly south. The wind\r\nwas strong, and we seemed to have struck a current that was running with\r\nremarkable swiftness in the same direction.\r\n\r\nIn just forty days we arrived at Delfi, a city we had visited in company\r\nwith our guides Jules Galdea and his wife, near the mouth of the\r\nGihon river. Here we stopped for two days, and were most hospitably\r\nentertained by the same people who had welcomed us on our former visit.\r\nWe laid in some additional provisions and again set sail, following the\r\nneedle due north.\r\n\r\nOn our outward trip we came through a narrow channel which appeared to\r\nbe a separating body of water between two considerable bodies of land.\r\nThere was a beautiful beach to our right, and we decided to reconnoiter.\r\nCasting anchor, we waded ashore to rest up for a day before continuing\r\nthe outward hazardous undertaking. We built a fire and threw on some\r\nsticks of dry driftwood. While my father was walking along the shore, I\r\nprepared a tempting repast from supplies we had provided.\r\n\r\nThere was a mild, luminous light which my father said resulted from the\r\nsun shining in from the south aperture of the earth. That night we slept\r\nsoundly, and awakened the next morning as refreshed as if we had been in\r\nour own beds at Stockholm.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we started out on an inland tour of discovery, but had\r\nnot gone far when we sighted some birds which we recognized at once as\r\nbelonging to the penguin family.\r\n\r\nThey are flightless birds, but excellent swimmers and tremendous in\r\nsize, with white breast, short wings, black head, and long peaked bills.\r\nThey stand fully nine feet high. They looked at us with little surprise,\r\nand presently waddled, rather than walked, toward the water, and swam\r\naway in a northerly direction.(21)\r\n\r\n(21 \"The nights are never so dark at the Poles as in other regions, for\r\nthe moon and stars seem to possess twice as much light and effulgence.\r\nIn addition, there is a continuous light, the varied shades and play\r\nof which are amongst the strangest phenomena of nature.\"--Rambrosson's\r\nAstronomy.)\r\n\r\nThe events that occurred during the following hundred or more days\r\nbeggar description. We were on an open and iceless sea. The month we\r\nreckoned to be November or December, and we knew the so-called South\r\nPole was turned toward the sun. Therefore, when passing out and away\r\nfrom the internal electrical light of \"The Smoky God\" and its genial\r\nwarmth, we would be met by the light and warmth of the sun, shining in\r\nthrough the south opening of the earth. We were not mistaken.(22)\r\n\r\n(22 \"The fact that gives the phenomenon of the polar aurora its greatest\r\nimportance is that the earth becomes self-luminous; that, besides the\r\nlight which as a planet is received from the central body, it shows\r\na capability of sustaining a luminous process proper to\r\nitself.\"--Humboldt.)\r\n\r\nThere were times when our little craft, driven by wind that was\r\ncontinuous and persistent, shot through the waters like an arrow.\r\nIndeed, had we encountered a hidden rock or obstacle, our little vessel\r\nwould have been crushed into kindling-wood.\r\n\r\nAt last we were conscious that the atmosphere was growing decidedly\r\ncolder, and, a few days later, icebergs were sighted far to the left. My\r\nfather argued, and correctly, that the winds which filled our sails came\r\nfrom the warm climate \"within.\" The time of the year was certainly most\r\nauspicious for us to make our dash for the \"outside\" world and attempt\r\nto scud our fishing sloop through open channels of the frozen zone which\r\nsurrounds the polar regions.\r\n\r\nWe were soon amid the ice-packs, and how our little craft got through.\r\nthe narrow channels and escaped being crushed I know not. The compass\r\nbehaved in the same drunken and unreliable fashion in passing over\r\nthe southern curve or edge of the earth's shell as it had done on our\r\ninbound trip at the northern entrance. It gyrated, dipped and seemed\r\nlike a thing possessed.(23)\r\n\r\n(23 Captain Sabine, on page 105 in \"Voyages in the Arctic Regions,\"\r\nsays: \"The geographical determination of the direction and intensity of\r\nthe magnetic forces at different points of the earth's surface has\r\nbeen regarded as an object worthy of especial research. To examine in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe, the declination, inclination and intensity\r\nof the magnetic force, and their periodical and secular variations, and\r\nmutual relations and dependencies could be duly investigated only in\r\nfixed magnetical observatories.\")\r\n\r\nOne day as I was lazily looking over the sloop's side into the clear\r\nwaters, my father shouted: \"Breakers ahead!\" Looking up, I saw through\r\na lifting mist a white object that towered several hundred feet high,\r\ncompletely shutting off our advance. We lowered sail immediately,\r\nand none too soon. In a moment we found ourselves wedged between two\r\nmonstrous icebergs. Each was crowding and grinding against its\r\nfellow mountain of ice. They were like two gods of war contending for\r\nsupremacy. We were greatly alarmed. Indeed, we were between the lines\r\nof a battle royal; the sonorous thunder of the grinding ice was like the\r\ncontinued volleys of artillery. Blocks of ice larger than a house were\r\nfrequently lifted up a hundred feet by the mighty force of lateral\r\npressure; they would shudder and rock to and fro for a few seconds, then\r\ncome crashing down with a deafening roar, and disappear in the foaming\r\nwaters. Thus, for more than two hours, the contest of the icy giants\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the end had come. The ice pressure was terrific, and\r\nwhile we were not caught in the dangerous part of the jam, and were safe\r\nfor the time being, yet the heaving and rending of tons of ice as it\r\nfell splashing here and there into the watery depths filled us with\r\nshaking fear.\r\n\r\nFinally, to our great joy, the grinding of the ice ceased, and within a\r\nfew hours the great mass slowly divided, and, as if an act of Providence\r\nhad been performed, right before us lay an open channel. Should we\r\nventure with our little craft into this opening? If the pressure came\r\non again, our little sloop as well as ourselves would be crushed into\r\nnothingness. We decided to take the chance, and, accordingly, hoisted\r\nour sail to a favoring breeze, and soon started out like a race-horse,\r\nrunning the gauntlet of this unknown narrow channel of open water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIVE. AMONG THE ICE PACKS\r\n\r\nFOR the next forty-five days our time was employed in dodging icebergs\r\nand hunting channels; indeed, had we not been favored with a strong\r\nsouth wind and a small boat, I doubt if this story could have ever been\r\ngiven to the world.\r\n\r\nAt last, there came a morning when my father said: \"My son, I think we\r\nare to see home. We are almost through the ice. See! the open water lies\r\nbefore us.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, there were a few icebergs that had floated far northward into\r\nthe open water still ahead of us on either side, stretching away for\r\nmany miles. Directly in front of us, and by the compass, which had now\r\nrighted itself, due north, there was an open sea.\r\n\r\n\"What a wonderful story we have to tell to the people of Stockholm,\"\r\ncontinued my father, while a look of pardonable elation lighted up his\r\nhonest face. \"And think of the gold nuggets stowed away in the hold!\"\r\n\r\nI spoke kind words of praise to my father, not alone for his fortitude\r\nand endurance, but also for his courageous daring as a discoverer, and\r\nfor having made the voyage that now promised a successful end. I was\r\ngrateful, too, that he had gathered the wealth of gold we were carrying\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWhile congratulating ourselves on the goodly supply of provisions and\r\nwater we still had on hand, and on the dangers we had escaped, we were\r\nstartled by hearing a most terrific explosion, caused by the tearing\r\napart of a huge mountain of ice. It was a deafening roar like the firing\r\nof a thousand cannon. We were sailing at the time with great speed, and\r\nhappened to be near a monstrous iceberg which to all appearances was as\r\nimmovable as a rockbound island. It seemed, however, that the iceberg\r\nhad split and was breaking apart, whereupon the balance of the monster\r\nalong which we were sailing was destroyed, and it began dipping from\r\nus. My father quickly anticipated the danger before I realized its awful\r\npossibilities. The iceberg extended down into the water many hundreds\r\nof feet, and, as it tipped over, the portion coming up out of the water\r\ncaught our fishing-craft like a lever on a fulcrum, and threw it into\r\nthe air as if it had been a foot-ball.\r\n\r\nOur boat fell back on the iceberg, that by this time had changed the\r\nside next to us for the top. My father was still in the boat, having\r\nbecome entangled in the rigging, while I was thrown some twenty feet\r\naway.\r\n\r\nI quickly scrambled to my feet and shouted to my father, who answered:\r\n\"All is well.\" Just then a realization dawned upon me. Horror upon\r\nhorror! The blood froze in my veins. The iceberg was still in motion,\r\nand its great weight and force in toppling over would cause it to\r\nsubmerge temporarily. I fully realized what a sucking maelstrom it would\r\nproduce amid the worlds of water on every side. They would rush into the\r\ndepression in all their fury, like white-fanged wolves eager for human\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nIn this supreme moment of mental anguish, I remember glancing at our\r\nboat, which was lying on its side, and wondering if it could possibly\r\nright itself, and if my father could escape. Was this the end of our\r\nstruggles and adventures? Was this death? All these questions flashed\r\nthrough my mind in the fraction of a second, and a moment later I was\r\nengaged in a life and death struggle. The ponderous monolith of ice sank\r\nbelow the surface, and the frigid waters gurgled around me in frenzied\r\nanger. I was in a saucer, with the waters pouring in on every side. A\r\nmoment more and I lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen I partially recovered my senses, and roused from the swoon of a\r\nhalf-drowned man, I found myself wet, stiff, and almost frozen, lying on\r\nthe iceberg. But there was no sign of my father or of our little fishing\r\nsloop. The monster berg had recovered itself, and, with its new balance,\r\nlifted its head perhaps fifty feet above the waves. The top of this\r\nisland of ice was a plateau perhaps half an acre in extent.\r\n\r\nI loved my father well, and was grief-stricken at the awfulness of his\r\ndeath. I railed at fate, that I, too, had not been permitted to sleep\r\nwith him in the depths of the ocean. Finally, I climbed to my feet and\r\nlooked about me. The purple-domed sky above, the shoreless green ocean\r\nbeneath, and only an occasional iceberg discernible! My heart sank in\r\nhopeless despair. I cautiously picked my way across the berg toward the\r\nother side, hoping that our fishing craft had righted itself.\r\n\r\nDared I think it possible that my father still lived? It was but a ray\r\nof hope that flamed up in my heart. But the anticipation warmed my blood\r\nin my veins and started it rushing like some rare stimulant through\r\nevery fiber of my body.\r\n\r\nI crept close to the precipitous side of the iceberg, and peered far\r\ndown, hoping, still hoping. Then I made a circle of the berg, scanning\r\nevery foot of the way, and thus I kept going around and around. One part\r\nof my brain was certainly becoming maniacal, while the other part, I\r\nbelieve, and do to this day, was perfectly rational.\r\n\r\nI was conscious of having made the circuit a dozen times, and while one\r\npart of my intelligence knew, in all reason, there was not a vestige of\r\nhope, yet some strange fascinating aberration bewitched and compelled\r\nme still to beguile myself with expectation. The other part of my brain\r\nseemed to tell me that while there was no possibility of my father being\r\nalive, yet, if I quit making the circuitous pilgrimage, if I paused for\r\na single moment, it would be acknowledgment of defeat, and, should I do\r\nthis, I felt that I should go mad. Thus, hour after hour I walked\r\naround and around, afraid to stop and rest, yet physically powerless\r\nto continue much longer. Oh! horror of horrors! to be cast away in this\r\nwide expanse of waters without food or drink, and only a treacherous\r\niceberg for an abiding place. My heart sank within me, and all semblance\r\nof hope was fading into black despair.\r\n\r\nThen the hand of the Deliverer was extended, and the death-like\r\nstillness of a solitude rapidly becoming unbearable was suddenly broken\r\nby the firing of a signal-gun. I looked up in startled amazement, when,\r\nI saw, less than a half-mile away, a whaling-vessel bearing down toward\r\nme with her sail full set.\r\n\r\nEvidently my continued activity on the iceberg had attracted their\r\nattention. On drawing near, they put out a boat, and, descending\r\ncautiously to the water's edge, I was rescued, and a little later lifted\r\non board the whaling-ship.\r\n\r\nI found it was a Scotch whaler, \"The Arlington.\" She had cleared from\r\nDundee in September, and started immediately for the Antarctic, in\r\nsearch of whales. The captain, Angus MacPherson, seemed kindly disposed,\r\nbut in matters of discipline, as I soon learned, possessed of an iron\r\nwill. When I attempted to tell him that I had come from the \"inside\" of\r\nthe earth, the captain and mate looked at each other, shook their heads,\r\nand insisted on my being put in a bunk under strict surveillance of the\r\nship's physician.\r\n\r\nI was very weak for want of food, and had not slept for many hours.\r\nHowever, after a few days' rest, I got up one morning and dressed myself\r\nwithout asking permission of the physician or anyone else, and told them\r\nthat I was as sane as anyone.\r\n\r\nThe captain sent for me and again questioned me concerning where I\r\nhad come from, and how I came to be alone on an iceberg in the far off\r\nAntarctic Ocean. I replied that I had just come from the \"inside\" of the\r\nearth, and proceeded to tell him how my father and myself had gone in\r\nby way of Spitzbergen, and come out by way of the South Pole country,\r\nwhereupon I was put in irons. I afterward heard the captain tell the\r\nmate that I was as crazy as a March hare, and that I must remain in\r\nconfinement until I was rational enough to give a truthful account of\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nFinally, after much pleading and many promises, I was released from\r\nirons. I then and there decided to invent some story that would satisfy\r\nthe captain, and never again refer to my trip to the land of \"The Smoky\r\nGod,\" at least until I was safe among friends.\r\n\r\nWithin a fortnight I was permitted to go about and take my place as one\r\nof the seamen. A little later the captain asked me for an explanation.\r\nI told him that my experience had been so horrible that I was fearful of\r\nmy memory, and begged him to permit me to leave the question\r\nunanswered until some time in the future. \"I think you are recovering\r\nconsiderably,\" he said, \"but you are not sane yet by a good deal.\"\r\n\"Permit me to do such work as you may assign,\" I replied, \"and if it\r\ndoes not compensate you sufficiently, I will pay you immediately after I\r\nreach Stockholm--to the last penny.\" Thus the matter rested.\r\n\r\nOn finally reaching Stockholm, as I have already related, I found that\r\nmy good mother had gone to her reward more than a year before. I\r\nhave also told how, later, the treachery of a relative landed me in a\r\nmadhouse, where I remained for twenty-eight years--seemingly unending\r\nyears--and, still later, after my release, how I returned to the life of\r\na fisherman, following it sedulously for twenty-seven years, then how\r\nI came to America, and finally to Los Angeles, California. But all this\r\ncan be of little interest to the reader. Indeed, it seems to me the\r\nclimax of my wonderful travels and strange adventures was reached when\r\nthe Scotch sailing-vessel took me from an iceberg on the Antarctic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SIX. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIN concluding this history of my adventures, I wish to state that I\r\nfirmly believe science is yet in its infancy concerning the cosmology\r\nof the earth. There is so much that is unaccounted for by the world's\r\naccepted knowledge of to-day, and will ever remain so until the land of\r\n\"The Smoky God\" is known and recognized by our geographers.\r\n\r\nIt is the land from whence came the great logs of cedar that have been\r\nfound by explorers in open waters far over the northern edge of the\r\nearth's crust, and also the bodies of mammoths whose bones are found in\r\nvast beds on the Siberian coast.\r\n\r\nNorthern explorers have done much. Sir John Franklin, De Haven Grinnell,\r\nSir John Murray, Kane, Melville, Hall, Nansen, Schwatka, Greely, Peary,\r\nRoss, Gerlache, Bernacchi, Andree, Amsden, Amundson and others have all\r\nbeen striving to storm the frozen citadel of mystery.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that Andree and his two brave companions, Strindberg\r\nand Fraenckell, who sailed away in the balloon \"Oreon\" from the\r\nnorthwest coast of Spitzbergen on that Sunday afternoon of July\r\n11, 1897, are now in the \"within\" world, and doubtless are being\r\nentertained, as my father and myself were entertained by the\r\nkind-hearted giant race inhabiting the inner Atlantic Continent.\r\n\r\nHaving, in my humble way, devoted years to these problems, I am well\r\nacquainted with the accepted definitions of gravity, as well as the\r\ncause of the magnetic needle's attraction, and I am prepared to say that\r\nit is my firm belief that the magnetic needle is influenced solely by\r\nelectric currents which completely envelop the earth like a garment,\r\nand that these electric currents in an endless circuit pass out of the\r\nsouthern end of the earth's cylindrical opening, diffusing and spreading\r\nthemselves over all the \"outside\" surface, and rushing madly on in their\r\ncourse toward the North Pole. And while these currents seemingly dash\r\noff into space at the earth's curve or edge, yet they drop again to the\r\n\"inside\" surface and continue their way southward along the inside of\r\nthe earth's crust, toward the opening of the so-called South Pole.(24)\r\n\r\n(24 \"Mr. Lemstrom concluded that an electric discharge which could only\r\nbe seen by means of the spectroscope was taking place on the surface of\r\nthe ground all around him, and that from a distance it would appear as\r\na faint display of Aurora, the phenomena of pale and flaming light which\r\nis some times seen on the top of the Spitzbergen Mountains.\"--The Arctic\r\nManual, page 739.)\r\n\r\nAs to gravity, no one knows what it is, because it has not been\r\ndetermined whether it is atmospheric pressure that causes the apple to\r\nfall, or whether, 150 miles below the surface of the earth, supposedly\r\none-half way through the earth's crust, there exists some powerful\r\nloadstone attraction that draws it. Therefore, whether the apple, when\r\nit leaves the limb of the tree, is drawn or impelled downward to the\r\nnearest point of resistance, is unknown to the students of physics.\r\n\r\nSir James Ross claimed to have discovered the magnetic pole at about\r\nseventy-four degrees latitude. This is wrong--the magnetic pole is\r\nexactly one-half the distance through the earth's crust. Thus, if the\r\nearth's crust is three hundred miles in thickness, which is the distance\r\nI estimate it to be, then the magnetic pole is undoubtedly one hundred\r\nand fifty miles below the surface of the earth, it matters not where the\r\ntest is made. And at this particular point one hundred and fifty miles\r\nbelow the surface, gravity ceases, becomes neutralized; and when we pass\r\nbeyond that point on toward the \"inside\" surface of the earth, a reverse\r\nattraction geometrically increases in power, until the other one hundred\r\nand fifty miles of distance is traversed, which would bring us out on\r\nthe \"inside\" of the earth.\r\n\r\nThus, if a hole were bored down through the earth's crust at London,\r\nParis, New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles, a distance of three hundred\r\nmiles, it would connect the two surfaces. While the inertia and momentum\r\nof a weight dropped in from the \"outside\" surface would carry it far\r\npast the magnetic center, yet, before reaching the \"inside\" surface\r\nof the earth it would gradually diminish in speed, after passing the\r\nhalfway point, finally pause and immediately fall back toward the\r\n\"outside\" surface, and continue thus to oscillate, like the swinging of\r\na pendulum with the power removed, until it would finally rest at\r\nthe magnetic center, or at that particular point exactly one-half the\r\ndistance between the \"outside\" surface and the \"inside\" surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe gyration of the earth in its daily act of whirling around in its\r\nspiral rotation--at a rate greater than one thousand miles every\r\nhour, or about seventeen miles per second--makes of it a vast\r\nelectro-generating body, a huge machine, a mighty prototype of the\r\npuny-man-made dynamo, which, at best, is but a feeble imitation of\r\nnature's original.\r\n\r\nThe valleys of this inner Atlantis Continent, bordering the upper waters\r\nof the farthest north are in season covered with the most magnificent\r\nand luxuriant flowers. Not hundreds and thousands, but millions, of\r\nacres, from which the pollen or blossoms are carried far away in almost\r\nevery direction by the earth's spiral gyrations and the agitation of the\r\nwind resulting therefrom, and it is these blossoms or pollen from the\r\nvast floral meadows \"within\" that produce the colored snows of the\r\nArctic regions that have so mystified the northern explorers.(25)\r\n\r\n(25 Kane, vol. I, page 44, says: \"We passed the 'crimson cliffs' of Sir\r\nJohn Ross in the forenoon of August 5th. The patches of red snow from\r\nwhich they derive their name could be seen clearly at the distance of\r\nten miles from the coast.\"\r\n\r\nLa Chambre, in an account of Andree's balloon expedition, on page\r\n144, says: \"On the isle of Amsterdam the snow is tinted with red for a\r\nconsiderable distance, and the savants are collecting it to examine\r\nit microscopically. It presents, in fact, certain peculiarities; it is\r\nthought that it contains very small plants. Scoresby, the famous whaler,\r\nhad already remarked this.\")\r\n\r\nBeyond question, this new land \"within\" is the home, the cradle, of the\r\nhuman race, and viewed from the standpoint of the discoveries made by\r\nus, must of necessity have a most important bearing on all physical,\r\npaleontological, archaeological, philological and mythological theories\r\nof antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe same idea of going back to the land of mystery--to the very\r\nbeginning--to the origin of man--is found in Egyptian traditions of\r\nthe earlier terrestrial regions of the gods, heroes and men, from\r\nthe historical fragments of Manetho, fully verified by the historical\r\nrecords taken from the more recent excavations of Pompeii as well as the\r\ntraditions of the North American Indians.\r\n\r\nIt is now one hour past midnight--the new year of 1908 is here, and this\r\nis the third day thereof, and having at last finished the record of my\r\nstrange travels and adventures I wish given to the world, I am ready,\r\nand even longing, for the peaceful rest which I am sure will follow\r\nlife's trials and vicissitudes. I am old in years, and ripe both with\r\nadventures and sorrows, yet rich with the few friends I have cemented to\r\nme in my struggles to lead a just and upright life. Like a story that\r\nis well-nigh told, my life is ebbing away. The presentiment is strong\r\nwithin me that I shall not live to see the rising of another sun. Thus\r\ndo I conclude my message.                   OLAF JANSEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SEVEN. AUTHOR'S AFTERWORD\r\n\r\nI FOUND much difficulty in deciphering and editing the manuscripts of\r\nOlaf Jansen. However, I have taken the liberty of reconstructing only\r\na very few expressions, and in doing this have in no way changed the\r\nspirit or meaning. Otherwise, the original text has neither been added\r\nto nor taken from.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to express my opinion as to the value or\r\nreliability of the wonderful statements made by Olaf Jansen. The\r\ndescription here given of the strange lands and people visited by\r\nhim, location of cities, the names and directions of rivers, and other\r\ninformation herein combined, conform in every way to the rough drawings\r\ngiven into my custody by this ancient Norseman, which drawings together\r\nwith the manuscript it is my intention at some later date to give to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, to preserve for the benefit of those interested\r\nin the mysteries of the \"Farthest North\"--the frozen circle of silence.\r\nIt is certain there are many things in Vedic literature, in \"Josephus,\"\r\nthe \"Odyssey,\" the \"Iliad,\" Terrien de Lacouperie's \"Early History of\r\nChinese Civilization,\" Flammarion's \"Astronomical Myths,\" Lenormant's\r\n\"Beginnings of History,\" Hesiod's \"Theogony,\" Sir John de Maundeville's\r\nwritings, and Sayce's \"Records of the Past,\" that, to say the least,\r\nare strangely in harmony with the seemingly incredible text found in\r\nthe yellow manuscript of the old Norseman, Olaf Jansen, and now for the\r\nfirst time given to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
