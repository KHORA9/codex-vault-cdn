Copies of each publication are distributed to libraries\r\nand scientific organizations and to specialists and others interested in\r\nthe various subjects.\r\n\r\nThe _Proceedings_, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in\r\nseparate form, of shorter papers. These are gathered in volumes, octavo\r\nin size, with the publication date of each paper recorded in the table\r\nof contents of the volume.\r\n\r\nIn the _Bulletin_ series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear\r\nlonger, separate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in\r\nseveral parts) and volumes in which are collected works on related\r\nsubjects. _Bulletins_ are either octavo or quarto in size, depending on\r\nthe needs of the presentation. Since 1902 papers relating to the\r\nbotanical collections of the Museum have been published in the\r\n_Bulletin_ series under the heading _Contributions from the United\r\nStates National Herbarium_.\r\n\r\n    FRANK A.

Phillips of the Department of Science and Technology of the\r\nU.S. National Museum; Prof. Derek J. de Solla Price, Avalon Professor of\r\nthe History of Science at Yale University; Mr. Stephen T.

For example, there have been\r\nnumerous works relating to clocks and clockmakers, so that the collector\r\nand horological student have a number of useful sources on which to\r\nrely. More recently there has been a series of publications on the\r\ndevelopment of American tools and their makers. Until now, however, no\r\nsystematic study has been attempted of the scientific instruments used\r\nin the United States from its colonial beginnings. While several useful\r\nregional lists of instrument makers in early America have been compiled\r\nfrom advertisements in contemporary newspapers and published as short\r\narticles, these, however, are fragmentary, and are inadequate to the\r\nneed for documentation in this field.\r\n\r\nWith the rapidly growing interest in the history of science, it becomes\r\nnecessary to have a more complete background for the student and the\r\nhistorian alike. It is desirable to have a more comprehensive picture of\r\nthe work of the scientific practitioners of the earlier periods of\r\nAmerican scientific development, and of their tools. At the same time it\r\nis essential to have a history of the development and distribution and\r\nuse of scientific instruments by others than the practitioners and\r\nteachers. The role of the instrument maker in the American Colonies was\r\nan important one--as it was in each epoch of the history of science in\r\nEurope--and it deserves to be reported.\r\n\r\nTo make a comprehensive study of American scientific instruments and\r\ninstrument makers in the American Colonies is no simple matter, partly\r\nbecause of an indifference to the subject in the past, and partly\r\nbecause of the great volume of sources that must be sifted to accomplish\r\nit. Such a project would require an organized search of all published\r\nreference works relating to the field and associated topics, of all\r\ncontemporary newspapers for advertisements and notices, of civil records\r\nfiled in state and community archives, of business account-books and\r\nrecords that have been preserved, and of business directories of the\r\nperiod under consideration. In addition, such a study would require the\r\ncompilation of an inventory of all surviving instruments in private and\r\npublic collections, and a correlation of all the data that could be\r\nassembled from these sources.\r\n\r\nThe present study attempts only in part to accomplish this aim, being no\r\nmore than a preliminary compilation of the scientific instruments known\r\nto have been used during the first two centuries of American colonial\r\nexistence. It merely attempts to assemble all the data that is presently\r\navailable in scattered sources, and to organize it in a usable form for\r\nthe student and historian of American science. A supplement relating to\r\n19th-century instruments and instrument makers is in progress.\r\n\r\nThe most that is hoped for the present work is that it will be of\r\ntemporary assistance, serving to bring forth additional information on\r\nthe subject from sources not previously available or known.\r\n\r\n    _February 1, 1964_  S.A.B.\r\n\r\n    EARLY AMERICAN\r\n    SCIENTIFIC\r\n    INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n    _and Their Makers_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tools of Science_\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophical and Practical Instruments\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the sciences in the American Colonies was critically\r\ndependent upon the available tools--scientific instruments--and the men\r\nwho made and used them. These tools may be separated into two groups.\r\nThe first group consists of philosophical instruments and scientific\r\nteaching apparatus produced and employed for experimentation and\r\nteaching in educational institutions. The second includes the so-called\r\n\"mathematical instruments\" of practical use, which were employed by\r\nmathematical practitioners and laymen alike for the mensural and\r\nnautical needs of the Colonies. It is particularly with this second\r\ngroup that the present study is concerned.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally assumed that scientific instruments, as well as\r\nthe instrument makers, of the first two centuries of American\r\ncolonization were imported from England, and that the movement declined\r\nby the beginning of the 19th century with the development of skilled\r\nnative craftsmen.[1] This assumption is basically true for those\r\ninstruments grouped under philosophical and scientific apparatus for\r\nexperimentation and teaching. Almost all of these items were in fact\r\nimported from England and France until well into the 19th century.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the very earliest examples of mathematical instruments for\r\nsurveying and navigation in the Colonies were imported with the settlers\r\nfrom England. It was not long after the establishment of the first\r\nsettlements, however, that the settlers, and later the first generation\r\nof native Americans, began to produce their own instruments. Records\r\nderived from historical archives and from the instruments themselves\r\nreveal that a considerable number of the instruments available and used\r\nin the Colonies before 1800 were of native production. Apparently,\r\nrelatively few instrument makers immigrated to the American continent\r\nbefore the end of the Revolutionary War. Later, with the beginning of\r\nthe 19th century, makers of and dealers in instruments in England and\r\nFrance became aware of the growing new market, and emigrated in numbers\r\nto establish shops in the major cities of commerce in the United States.\r\n\r\nQuite possibly the few instrument makers trained in England who\r\nimmigrated to the Colonies in the early epoch of Colonial development\r\nmay have in turn trained others in their communities, although no\r\nevidence has yet been found. Perhaps more data on this aspect of the\r\nsubject will eventually come to light.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that a few mathematical practitioners and\r\ninstrument makers lived and worked in the New England colonies as early\r\nas the first century of colonization.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, frankly meager, consists of two items. The first is a\r\nreference relating to James Halsie of Boston. In a land deed made out to\r\nhim in 1674 he was referred to as a \"Mathematician.\"[2] Halsie was\r\nlisted as a freeman of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1690. He\r\napparently was the forbear of the several members of the Halsy family of\r\ninstrument makers of Boston of the 18th century, mentioned later in this\r\nstudy. It is uncertain whether the use of the term \"mathematician\" in\r\nthis connection meant an artisan, but if not it may be inferred that\r\nHalsie was a practitioner.\r\n\r\nThe second piece of evidence is even more slender; it consists of an\r\ninscription upon a dialing rule (fig. 1) for making sundials and charts.\r\nThe instrument is of cast brass, 20-7/16 inches long and 1-11/16 inches\r\nwide. The date \"1674\" is inscribed on the rule together with the name of\r\nits original owner, \"Arthur Willis.\" The instrument almost certainly was\r\nproduced by the school of Henry Sutton, the notable English instrument\r\nmaker who worked in Threadneedle Street in London from about 1637\r\nthrough 1665. The name and date inscriptions are consistent and\r\ncontemporary with the workmanship of the rule, and were probably\r\ninscribed by the maker for the original owner. It is conceivable that\r\nArthur Willis was an Englishman and that the rule was brought into this\r\ncountry even in relatively recent times. However, it is claimed that the\r\nrule was owned and used by Nathaniel Footes, surveyor of Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts. Nathaniel Footes, believed to have been originally from\r\nSalem, subsequently moved from Springfield to Wethersfield, Conn. The\r\ninstrument was later owned and used in Connecticut not later than the\r\nearly 19th century[3] by the forbears of Mr. Newton C. Brainard of\r\nHartford, Connecticut. If records relating to Willis as a resident of\r\nthe New England colonies can be recovered, it may then be possible to\r\nestablish whether he worked in the Colonies as a mathematical\r\npractitioner in the 17th century. His name is included on a tentative\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--Dialing rule made of brass and inscribed with\r\nthe name \"Arthur Willis\" and the date \"1674.\" Allegedly used by\r\nNathaniel Footes, surveyor of Springfield, Massachusetts.

Brainard, Hartford, Connecticut, and the Connecticut\r\nHistorical Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Need for Instruments\r\n\r\nThe production and use of scientific instruments in the American\r\nColonies reflected colonial development in education and in territorial\r\nand economic expansion, and closely paralleled the same development in\r\nEngland, where the first mathematical practitioners were the teachers of\r\nnavigational and commercial arithmetic and the surveyors employed in the\r\nredistribution of land following the dissolution of the monasteries. As\r\nthe communities became established and the settlers gained a foothold on\r\nthe soil, their attention naturally turned to improving their lot by\r\nexpanding the land under cultivation and by trading their products for\r\nother needs. The growth of the communities became increasingly rapid\r\nfrom the end of the 17th century, and the land expansion closely\r\nparalleled the development of trade. The educational institutions placed\r\ngreater emphasis on the sciences as their curriculums developed.\r\nParticularly there was a greater preoccupation with the sciences on the\r\npart of the layman because of the need for knowledge of surveying and\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nThe colonial school curriculum was accordingly designed from the\r\npractical point of view to emphasize practical mathematics, and there\r\nwas an increasing demand for instruction in all aspects of the subject.\r\nOne of the earliest advertisements of this nature appeared in _The\r\nBoston Gazette_ in March 1719. In the issue of February 19 to March 7\r\nthe advertisement stated that:\r\n\r\n     This day Mr. Samuel Grainger opens his school at the House formerly\r\n     Sir Charles Hobby's, where will be taught Grammar Writing after a\r\n     free and easy manner in all the usual Hands, Arithmetick in a\r\n     concise and Practical Method, Merchants Accompts, and the\r\n     Mathematicks.\r\n\r\n     He hopes that more thinking People will in no wise be discouraged\r\n     from sending their children thither, on the account of the reports\r\n     newly reviv'd, because these dancing Phaenomena's were never seen\r\n     nor heard of in School Hours.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement was further amplified in its second appearance, in the\r\nissue of March 21-22, 1719:\r\n\r\n     At the house formerly Sir Charles Hobby's are taught grammar,\r\n     writing, after a free & easy manner in all hands usually practiced,\r\n     Arithmetick Vulgar and Decimal in a concise and Practical Method,\r\n     Merchants Accompts, Geometry, Algebra, Mensuration, Geography,\r\n     Trigonometry, Astronomy, Navigation and other parts of the\r\n     Mathematicks, with the use of the Globes and other Mathematical\r\n     Instruments, by Samuel Grainger.\r\n\r\n     They whose business won't permit 'em to attend the usual School\r\n     Hours, shall be carefully attended and Instructed in the Evenings.\r\n\r\nR. F. Seybold[4] has noted that: \"In advertisements of 1753 and 1754,\r\nJohn Lewis, of New York City, announced 'What is called a New Method of\r\nNavigation, is an excellent Method of Trigonometry here particularly\r\napplied to Navigation; But it is of great use in all kinds of measuring\r\nand in solving many Arithmetical Questions.' James Cosgrove, of\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1755, taught 'geometry, trigonometry, and their\r\napplication in surveying, navigation, etc.,' and Alexander Power, in\r\n1766, 'With their Application to Surveying, Navigation, Geography, and\r\nAstronomy'.\" These subjects were featured also in the evening schools of\r\nthe colonial period, maintained by private schoolmasters in some of the\r\nlarger communities for the education of those who could not attend\r\nschool in the daytime.\r\n\r\nAccording to Seybold, surveying and navigation were the most popular\r\nmathematical subjects taught. Some explanation is to be derived from the\r\nstatement by Schoen[5] that: \"In the days when the 'bounds' of great\r\nwilderness tracts were being marked off by deep-cut blazes in the trees\r\nalong a line, a knowledge of land surveying was a useful skill, and many\r\na boy learned its elements by following the 'boundsgoer' in his work of\r\n'running the line.' And those who did not actually take part in running\r\nthe line must have attended many a gay springtime 'processioning' when\r\nneighbors made a festive occasion out of 'perambulating the bounds'.\"\r\n\"Vague land grants and inaccurate surveys,\" he adds, \"made the subject\r\nof boundary lines a prime issue in the everyday life of colonial homes.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time there was interest in the other aspects of the\r\nmathematical sciences. As early as 1743, for instance, a Harvard\r\nmathematician named Nathan Prince advertised in Boston that if he were\r\ngiven \"suitable Encouragement\" he would establish a school to teach\r\n\"Geography and Astronomy, With the Use of the Globes, and the several\r\nkinds of Projecting the Sphere\" among other things.[6] A decade later,\r\nTheophilus Grew, professor in the academy at Philadelphia which has\r\nbecome the University of Pennsylvania, published a treatise on globes,\r\nwith the title:\r\n\r\n     _The Description_ and _Use_ of the _Globes_, Celestial and\r\n     Terrestrial; With Variety for _Examples_ for the Learner's\r\n     _Exercises_: Intended for the Use of Such Persons as would attain\r\n     to the Knowledge of those _Instruments_; But Chiefly designed for\r\n     the _Instruction_ of the young _Gentlemen_ at the _Academy_ in\r\n     Philadelphia. To which is added Rules for working all the Cases in\r\n     Plain and Spherical Triangles without a Scheme. By _Theophilus\r\n     Grew_, Mathematical Professor. Germantown, Printed by Christopher\r\n     Sower, 1753.[7]\r\n\r\nThus, the need for practical mathematical instruments for the surveyor\r\nand navigator became critical in proportion to the need for men to make\r\nand use them, and it is not surprising to discover that the majority of\r\nthe instruments produced and advertised by early American makers were\r\nfor surveying, with nautical instruments in second place. Generally, the\r\nsurveyors were not professionals; they were farmers, tradesmen, or\r\ncraftsmen with a sound knowledge of basic arithmetic and occasionally\r\nwith some advanced study of the subject as taught in the evening\r\nschools. The surveying of provincial and intercolonial boundaries\r\nrequired greater skill, however, as well as a knowledge of astronomy,\r\nand this work was relegated to the scientific men of the period.\r\n\r\nAs the increasing preoccupation with subdivision of land and with\r\nsurveying led to a greater demand for suitable instruments, it was the\r\nskilled craftsmen of the community, such as the clockmaker and the\r\nsilversmith, that were called upon to produce them. Superb examples also\r\nwere produced by the advanced scientific men, or \"mathematical\r\npractitioners,\" of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonial Training in Instrument Making\r\n\r\nOne may well ask, where did these native craftsmen acquire the knowledge\r\nthat enabled them to produce so skillfully the accurate and often\r\ndelicate mathematical instruments? There were a number of possible\r\nsources for this knowledge. The first source lies in England, where some\r\nof these craftsmen could have studied or served apprenticeships. After\r\ncompleting their apprenticeship with English mathematical practitioners,\r\nthey may have immigrated to the Colonies and taught the craft to others.\r\nThis seems to be entirely plausible, and was probably true, for example,\r\nof Thomas Harland the clockmaker, Anthony Lamb, and perhaps several\r\nothers. However, these were the exceptions instead of the rule, since a\r\nbiographical study of the instrument makers in general reveals that they\r\nwere for the most part native to America. It is not likely that the one\r\nor two isolated practitioners that had been trained in England could\r\nhave taught so many others who worked in the same epoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Title page of _The Surveyor_ by Aaron\r\nRathborne, published in London in 1616. The book was one of the sources\r\nof information for American makers of mathematical instruments.]\r\n\r\nAnother source for this knowledge of instrument making was probably the\r\nreference works on the subject that had been published in England and in\r\nFrance. As an example, Nicolas Bion's _Traite de la Construction et des\r\nPrincipaux Usages des Instruments de Mathematique_, which had been first\r\npublished in 1686, was translated into English by Edmund Stone in 1723,\r\nand went into several English editions. Copies of this work in English\r\nundoubtedly found their way to America soon after publication. Other\r\npopular works were Aaron Rathbone's _The Surveyor_, which appeared in\r\nLondon in 1616 (see fig. 2); William Leybourn's _The Compleat Surveyor_,\r\nin 1653; and George Atwell's _Faithfull Surveyour_, in 1662. Other works\r\npopular in the Colonies were R. Norwood's _Epitome, or The Doctrine of\r\nTriangles_ (London, 1659) and J. Love's _Geodasia, or the Art of\r\nSurveying_ (London, 1688).\r\n\r\nThese works undoubtedly inspired similar publications in America, for\r\nmany books on surveying and navigation appeared there before the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century. Chief among them were S. Moore's _An\r\nAccurate System of Surveying_ (Litchfield, Conn., 1796), Z. Jess's _A\r\nCompendious System of Practical Surveying_ (Wilmington, 1799), Abel\r\nFlint's _Surveying_ (Hartford, 1804), and J. Day's _Principles of\r\nNavigation and Surveying_ (New Haven, 1817).\r\n\r\nThe published works were unquestionably responsible for much of the\r\ntraining in the making of mathematical instruments in America, although\r\nno documentary evidence has yet been recovered to prove it.\r\n\r\nAnother important influence on early American instrument-making which\r\nmust be noted was that of the clockmaker as an artisan. A comprehensive\r\nstudy of surviving instruments and related records has revealed that\r\nonly a few of the many clockmakers working in the American Colonies in\r\nthe 18th century made mathematical instruments. Yet, a large proportion\r\nof the surviving surveying and nautical instruments produced before 1800\r\nwere the work of clockmakers. Classic among these must be noted the\r\ninstruments produced by the brothers David and Benjamin Rittenhouse (see\r\np. 15 and figs. 3 and 4), as well as the fine surveying instruments made\r\nby four separate members of the Chandlee family, whose clockmaking\r\ntraditions began early in the 17th century (see p. 54).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Transit telescope made by David Rittenhouse\r\nand used by him for the observation of the transit of Venus in 1769.\r\nBrass, 33-1/2-in. tube on a 25-in. axis, with an aperture of 1-3/4 in.\r\nand a focal length of 32 in. Photo courtesy the American Philosophical\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Surveying compass marked \"Potts and\r\nRittenhouse.\" Believed to be the work of David Rittenhouse in\r\npartnership with Thomas Potts. Photo courtesy the American Philosophical\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\nFinally, one must not overlook the fact that examples of English and\r\nother European instruments were available in the Colonies, and that at\r\nleast some of the early colonial makers undoubtedly copied them. It is\r\napparent from some surviving early American instruments that the\r\nmaterials, designs, dimensions, and details of European prototypes had\r\nbeen deliberately copied. It is possible to see in public collections,\r\nfor instance, a Davis quadrant of English manufacture exhibited beside a\r\nlater example, signed by a New England maker, which comes\r\nextraordinarily close to duplicating it in every feature.\r\n\r\nAs with the presumed influence of published works, the practice of\r\ncopying imported instruments cannot be documented, but it must have been\r\nengaged in by many of the unschooled New England instrument makers. By\r\nthis means some may even have profited to the degree that they became\r\nprofessional craftsmen without benefit of formal apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nYet it is remarkable that although numerous instruments were produced by\r\nnative artisans, in addition to the substantial number which were\r\nimported before the end of the 18th century, relatively few specimens\r\nhave survived in public collections as well as in private hands. Despite\r\nthe exhaustive combing of attics and barns throughout the country by\r\ndealers in antiques and by avid collectors during the past several\r\ndecades, the number of surviving instruments now known is incredibly\r\nsmall in comparison with the numbers known to have been made locally or\r\nimported before the beginning of the 19th century. Since instruments are\r\nnot items which would ordinarily be deliberately discarded or destroyed,\r\nor melted down for the recovery of the metal, this small percentage of\r\nsurvival presents a puzzle which has not been resolved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--David Rittenhouse. Engraving from portrait by\r\nCharles Wilson Peale.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mathematical Practitioners_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rittenhouse Brothers\r\n\r\nNotable among the American practitioners was David Rittenhouse\r\n(1732-1796) of Norristown and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was\r\nestablished as a clockmaker and surveyor in Philadelphia by 1749. He\r\nsurveyed the boundary between Pennsylvania and Delaware in 1763 with\r\ninstruments of his own design and construction. Six years later, in\r\n1769, he successfully calculated the transit of Venus and later\r\nobserved that planet with astronomical instruments he had constructed\r\nhimself. In the following year, 1770, he built the first American\r\nastronomical observatory, in Philadelphia. Two orreries that he designed\r\nand built--at the University of Pennsylvania and at Princeton\r\nUniversity--survive as outstanding examples of American craftsmanship.[8]\r\nSeveral of his surveying and astronomical instruments are exhibited in the\r\ncollections of the U.S. National Museum. David Rittenhouse is credited\r\nwith being the originator of a declination arc on the surveying compass,\r\na feature to be copied by a number of later instrument makers.\r\n\r\nDavid's brother, Benjamin Rittenhouse (1740-c.1820), served in the\r\nRevolution and was wounded at Brandywine. He superintended the\r\nGovernment's gunlock factory at Philadelphia in 1778 and achieved\r\nrecognition as a maker of clocks and surveying instruments (see fig.\r\n8).[9] During one period of his career he worked in partnership with his\r\nbrother David. An interesting advertisement appeared in the May 14,\r\n1785, issue of _The Pennsylvania Packet_:\r\n\r\n     WANTED, An ingenious Lad not exceeding 14 years of age, of a\r\n     reputable family, as an Apprentice to learn the Art and Mistery of\r\n     making Clocks and Surveying Instruments. Any lad inclining to go an\r\n     apprentice to the above Trade, the terms on which he will be taken\r\n     may [be] known by enquiring of Mr. David Rittenhouse, in\r\n     Philadelphia, or at the subscriber's house in Worcester township,\r\n     Montgomery county. Benjamin Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--Astronomical clock made by David Rittenhouse\r\nfor his observatory at Norristown, Pa., and used by him for the\r\nobservation of the transit of Venus in 1769.

Andrew was the son of Joseph Ellicott, the clockmaker\r\nand pioneer industrialist who founded Ellicotts Mills. Although a\r\nQuaker, Andrew (fig. 9) served in the Revolution, and he became one of\r\nthe most distinguished engineers of the new republic. He worked as a\r\nclockmaker and instrument maker from 1774 to 1780. In 1784 he ran the\r\nboundary between Virginia and Pennsylvania and in the following year he\r\nwas a member of the survey that continued Mason and Dixon's line. In\r\n1785 and 1786 he served on the Pennsylvania commissions that surveyed\r\nthe western and northern boundaries of the state, and in 1789 he served\r\non the commission that fixed the boundary between New York and\r\nPennsylvania. Between 1791 and 1793 he surveyed the site of the city of\r\nWashington, D.C., and redrew L'Enfant's plan for the city.\r\n\r\nIn early 1793 Ellicott was appointed commissioner by the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania for the project of viewing and locating a road from Reading\r\nto Presque Isle, now Erie. It was an extremely difficult undertaking,\r\nbut Ellicott completed the work by the autumn of 1796, including laying\r\nout the towns of Erie, Warren, and Franklin.\r\n\r\nIn May 1796 Ellicott was commissioned by President Washington to survey\r\nand mark the boundary line between the United States and the Spanish\r\nProvince of Florida in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nPinkney-Godoy Treaty of October 27, 1795. This line was to begin at the\r\npoint where the 31st parallel of north latitude intersected the\r\nMississippi River, and to proceed thence along that parallel eastward to\r\nthe Appalachicola River for about 400 miles.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 Ellicott was offered the position of surveyor general of the\r\nUnited States by President Jefferson. Ellicott declined, but\r\nsubsequently accepted the secretaryship of the land office of\r\nPennsylvania, a post he held until 1808.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Ellicott became commissioner to represent Georgia in locating\r\nthe Georgia-North Carolina boundary, a project on which he was engaged\r\nfor the major part of the following year.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 President Madison appointed Ellicott professor of mathematics at\r\nWest Point, with the rank of major. This is an appointment he kept until\r\nhis death in 1820. It was interrupted in 1817 when the Government\r\nrequired his services as astronomer to locate a portion of the United\r\nStates-Canadian boundary in accordance with the fifth article of the\r\nTreaty of Ghent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--Transit and equal-altitude instrument (left)\r\nmade by Ellicott in 1789 and used by him in the survey of the boundary\r\nbetween the United States and Florida and in other surveys. USNM\r\n152080.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--Zenith sector with focal length of 6 ft.,\r\nmade by David Rittenhouse and revised by Andrew Ellicott. Described in\r\n_Journal of Andrew Ellicott_ (Philadelphia, 1803). USNM 152078.]\r\n\r\nEllicott was a member of a number of learned societies, including the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society, the Society for the Promotion of Useful\r\nArts of Albany, and of the National Institute of France.\r\n\r\nEllicott constructed a number of instruments for surveying and\r\nastronomical observation, and he designed and used others that were\r\nproduced by his friend David Rittenhouse[10] (see figs. 10, 11). Of\r\nparticular interest in connection with Ellicott's career as a clockmaker\r\nand instrument maker are two advertisements that appeared in the\r\nBaltimore newspapers. The first one was in the _Maryland Journal and\r\nBaltimore Daily Advertiser on April 7, 1778_:\r\n\r\n     Ellicott's Upper Mills, April 4, 1778. Wanted, a person acquainted\r\n     with the Clock-Making business, and able to work by directions.\r\n     Such a person will meet with good encouragement by applying to\r\n     Andrew Ellicott, sen.\r\n\r\nThe second advertisement, in the same vein, appeared in the May 16,\r\n1780, issue of the _Maryland Journal_:\r\n\r\n     Good Encouragement will be given to either Clock or Mathematical\r\n     instrument makers, by the subscriber, living in Baltimore-Town.\r\n     Andrew Ellicott.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwen Biddle\r\n\r\nAnother mathematical practitioner associated with David Rittenhouse in\r\nhis observations of the transit of Venus was Owen Biddle (1737-1799) of\r\nthe North Ward, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn early life Biddle was an apothecary and a clock and watchmaker. In\r\nhis shop \"next door to Roberts warehouse\" he sold clock and watch parts\r\nand tools. From 1764 to 1770 he advertised himself as \"Clockmaker, and\r\nscientist, statesman and patriot.\" As a Quaker, he participated actively\r\nin civic and patriotic affairs of Philadelphia. During the American\r\nRevolution, in spite of his religious affiliation, he fought for the\r\ndefense of the Colonies and was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Forage.\r\nEvidencing sincere repentance, he was permitted to rejoin the Society of\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 Biddle took an active part in the preparations made by the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society for the observation of the transit of\r\nVenus. With Joel Baily he was sent to Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with a\r\nlarge reflecting telescope borrowed from the Library Company. The\r\nexpedition was described in the _Transactions of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society_ in 1771 in an article entitled \"An Account of the\r\nTransit of Venus, over the Sun's Disk, as observed near Cape Henlopen,\r\non Delaware Bay, June 3rd, 1769 by Owen Biddle, Joel Baily and (Richard\r\nThomas) Drawn by Owen Biddle.\" In addition to his trade in clocks and\r\nwatches, Biddle also made mathematical instruments and was well known in\r\nhis native city as a merchant, inventor, and ironmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Banneker\r\n\r\nA name that is too often ignored in the history of science in colonial\r\nAmerica is that of a free Negro, Benjamin Banneker (c. 1734-1806) of\r\nBaltimore. A farmer by occupation, Banneker was the son of a native\r\nAfrican slave and a free mulatto woman. In his spare time he attended\r\nthe school of a Quaker farmer; the only book he owned was the Bible.\r\nWhen he was a young man he acquired a watch from a trader, and from it\r\nhe developed his love of science and instruments. Although he had never\r\nseen a clock, he constructed one based on drawings he made from the\r\nwatch. Banneker was called upon to assist in the construction of the\r\nmills for the Ellicotts, and it was natural that his clock, which was\r\nthe marvel of the Negro settlement, should come to the attention of\r\nJoseph Ellicott. Ellicott became interested in Banneker's thirst for\r\nknowledge and allowed him the use of his tools, scientific instruments,\r\nand technical books. Among the books were Mayer's _Tables_, James\r\nFerguson's _Astronomy_, and Leadbeater's _Lunar Tables_. Banneker\r\nabsorbed these and other works that he borrowed and went on to explore\r\nthe wonderful new world they opened up for him. He pursued astronomical\r\nstudies, and within three years he began to make calculations (fig. 12)\r\nfor an almanac. After completing the calculations for the year 1791, he\r\nwent on to produce a set of calculations for 1792. During this period he\r\nmastered the use of surveying instruments and made a firsthand study of\r\ntides in the region. His great opportunity came when Andrew Ellicott was\r\nchosen to make a survey for the city of Washington and hired Banneker as\r\nan assistant. While thus employed, Banneker completed his almanac and\r\ngave it to George Ellicott, Andrew's cousin, as a subject of possible\r\ninterest. Apparently George Ellicott turned it over to the Honorable\r\nJames McHenry of Baltimore, who in turned submitted it to the\r\nPhiladelphia firm of Goddard & Angell, who published it (fig. 13).\r\nBanneker mailed a copy of his _Benjamin Banneker's Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Virginia And Maryland Almanac and Ephemeris For the Year of\r\nOur Lord, 1792_ to Thomas Jefferson, who was so impressed with it that\r\nhe forwarded it to the Marquis de Condorcet, secretary of the French\r\nAcademy of Sciences. After his work with Ellicott had been completed,\r\nBanneker retired to his farm to produce almanacs annually until 1802.\r\nWhen he died in 1806 he was eulogized before the French Academy by the\r\nMarquis de Condorcet, and William Pitt placed his name in the records of\r\nthe English Parliament.[11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--Letter from Benjamin Banneker to George\r\nEllicott dated October 13, 1789, regarding astronomical data for the\r\ncompilation of Banneker's almanac. Photo courtesy Maryland Historical\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJoel Baily\r\n\r\nStill another 18th-century practitioner was Joel Baily (1732-1797), a\r\nQuaker of West Bradford, Pennsylvania. In addition to his trade as a\r\nclockmaker and gunsmith, Baily achieved local eminence as an astronomer,\r\nmathematician, and surveyor.[12]\r\n\r\nIn 1764, at the time that Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon established\r\ntheir headquarters near his farm, Baily was the local surveyor.\r\nObtaining employment with the expedition, he worked with Mason and Dixon\r\nuntil the completion of their survey in 1768. Baily was subsequently\r\nemployed by Mason and Dixon to build pine frames for carrying the\r\n20-foot rods to be used in the second measurement of courses from the\r\nStargazers' Stone southward.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 Baily was appointed by the American Philosophical Society to\r\nwork with Owen Biddle in setting up the station at Cape Henlopen for\r\nobservation of the transit of Venus. In 1770 he again worked with Biddle\r\nin taking the courses and distances from the New Castle Court House to\r\nthe State House Observatory in Philadelphia for determining the latitude\r\nand longitude of each. In the same year Baily was elected a member of\r\nthe American Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nReverend John Prince\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy mathematical practitioner of the period was the\r\nReverend John Prince (1751-1836) of Salem, Massachusetts. The son of a\r\nhatter and mechanic, Prince studied natural philosophy under John\r\nWinthrop at Harvard and received his B.A. degree in 1776. He was a\r\nstudent of divinity under Samuel Williams and was ordained in 1779 at\r\nthe First Church in Salem. Although an amateur of the sciences, Prince\r\nbecame a skilled maker of scientific instruments. He made, sold, and\r\nrepaired instruments for the use of numerous colleges, schools, and\r\nacademies, including Brown, Dartmouth, Rutgers, Harvard, Union, Amherst,\r\nand Williams. Among other accomplishments, he effected \"improvements\" on\r\nthe lucernal microscope and the air pump.[13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--Title page of one of Banneker's almanacs. The\r\nportrait of Banneker was made by Timothy Woods in 1793 for the publisher\r\nand reproduced by woodcut. Banneker's first almanac was published in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1792.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmasa Holcomb\r\n\r\nAlthough he was born in the 18th century, Amasa Holcomb (1787-1875)\r\nproperly belongs to a later period. An astronomer and telescope maker of\r\nSouthwick, Massachusetts, Holcomb became a surveyor in 1808. An\r\nautobiographical sketch noted that \"he manufactured about this time a\r\ngood many sets of surveyors instruments--compasses, chains, scales,\r\nprotractors and dividers, some for his pupils and some for others.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstruments of Metal\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-Revolutionary Immigrant Makers\r\n\r\nAccording to present evidence, only a few makers of metal instruments\r\nemigrated from England to the Colonies before the beginning of the\r\nRevolutionary War. A slightly larger number emigrated after the war had\r\nended. In almost every instance, the immigrant instrument makers settled\r\nin the major cities, which were the shipping centers of the new country.\r\nThe reason is obvious: in these cities there was the greatest demand for\r\nnautical and other instruments.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest immigrant instrument makers arrived in Boston in\r\n1739. According to an advertisement that appeared in _The Boston\r\nGazette_ in the issue of July 16-23, 1739, there had\r\n\r\n     Arriv'd here by Capt. _Gerry_ from _London_ John Dabney, junr. who\r\n     serv'd his time to Mr. Jonathan Sisson, Mathematical Instrument\r\n     Maker to his Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales. Makes and sells\r\n     all sorts of Mathematical Instruments, in Silver, Brass, or Ivory,\r\n     at Reasonable Rates, at Mr. Rowland Houghton's Shop the north side\r\n     of the Town Huse in Boston.\r\n\r\n     N.B. Said Dabney, sets Loadstones to a greater Perfection than any\r\n     heretofore.\r\n\r\nDabney's master, Jonathan Sisson (1694-1749) originally of Lincolnshire,\r\nwith a shop in the Strand, London, was a well-known maker of optical and\r\nmathematical instruments in the early decades of the 18th century. He\r\nwas particularly noted for the exact division of scales, and examples of\r\nhis work are to be found in the major collections.\r\n\r\nDabney's name appeared again several years later, in the Supplement to\r\nthe _Boston Evening Post_ for December 12, 1743, and again in the\r\n_Boston Evening Post_ for December 19 of the same year, with the\r\nfollowing advertisement:\r\n\r\n     To be shown by John Dabney, Mathematical Instrument maker, in Milk\r\n     Street, Boston, on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday Evenings, from five\r\n     to eight o'clock, for the Entertainment of the Curious, the Magic\r\n     Lanthorn an Optick Machine, which exhibits a great Number of\r\n     wonderful and surprising Figures, prodigious large, and vivid, at\r\n     Half a Crown each, Old Tenor.\r\n\r\nIn New York City, one of the earliest immigrant instrument makers was\r\nCharles Walpole, who established a shop at a corner in Wall Street,\r\naccording to a notice in the May 26, 1746, issue of the _New York\r\nEvening Post_. The announcement stated that Walpole was a \"citizen of\r\nLondon\" and that at his shop \"all sorts of Mathematical Instruments,\r\nwhether in silver or brass, are made and mended....\"\r\n\r\nIn the May 21, 1753, issue of _The New York Gazette or The Weekly Post\r\nBoy_ there was an announcement by the widow of Balthaser Sommer who\r\nlived on Pot-Baker's Hill in Smith Street in New York City and who\r\nadvertised herself as a \"grinder of all sorts of optic glasses, spying\r\nglasses, of all lengths, spectacles, reading glasses for near-sighted\r\npeople or others; also spying glasses of 3 feet long which are to set on\r\na common Walking-Cane and yet be carried as a Pocket-Book.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Benson emigrated from Birmingham, England, and established a\r\nlapidary and optical store in May 1793 at 12 Princess Street in New\r\nYork, where he produced miniatures, lockets, rings, glasses, \"as well as\r\nSpectacles, single reading and burning glasses, and where he also\r\npolished scratch'd glasses.\" In July 1797 he moved to 106 Pearl Street\r\nwhere he sold green goggles, thermometers, and opera and spy glasses, in\r\naddition to an assortment of jewelry. In September 1798 he was\r\nestablished at a new location, 147 Pearl Street, \"At the sign of The\r\nGreen Spectacles\" where he specialized in optical goods. He featured for\r\nrent or sale a \"Portable Camera Obscura\" for the use of artists in\r\ndrawing landscapes. His advertisements chronicled each change in\r\nlocation in the issues of _The New York Daily Advertiser_.\r\n\r\nA craftsman whose name is well known in scientific circles was Anthony\r\nLamb, who advertised in 1753 as a mathematical instrument maker living\r\non Hunter's Key, New York. He claimed that he could furnish\r\n\r\n     Godfrey's newly invented quadrant, for taking the latitude or other\r\n     altitudes at sea; hydrometers for trying the exact strength of\r\n     spirits, large surveying instruments in a more curious manner than\r\n     usual; which may be used in any weather without exception, small\r\n     ditto which may be fixed on the end of a walking stick, and\r\n     lengthened to a commodious height, gauging instruments as now in\r\n     use, according to an act of assembly with all other mathematical\r\n     instruments for sea or land, by wholesale or retail at reasonable\r\n     rates.[15]\r\n\r\nLamb had served an apprenticeship with Henry Carter, a mathematical\r\ninstrument maker in London. In July 1724 he became an accomplice of\r\nJack Sheppard, a notorious burglar, and was arrested and sentenced to\r\nthe gallows in 1724. As he was awaiting execution on the gallows at\r\nTyburn, his sentence was commuted to transportation to Virginia for a\r\nperiod of seven years, inasmuch as this was his first offence. After he\r\nhad completed his term of seven years in Virginia he moved to\r\nPhiladelphia, where he opened a shop as an instrument maker and a\r\nprivate school for teaching technical subjects. The curriculum included\r\nsurveying, navigation, and mathematics. Although his enterprises\r\nprospered, he moved to New York. There he married a Miss Ham and\r\nestablished himself in a respectable position. Lamb's first\r\nadvertisement in New York appeared on January 23, 1749. He died on\r\nDecember 11, 1784, at the age of 81, and two days later he was eulogized\r\nin _The New York Packet_ where he was mentioned as \"a steady friend to\r\nthe liberties of America.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Lamb (1735-1800), Anthony's son, learned and practiced his father's\r\ncraft for a time and worked as a partner in the firm of A. Lamb & Son.\r\nHe subsequently became a wine and sugar merchant, achieved considerable\r\nwealth, married well, and was accepted by the gentry of the city. He was\r\na firm patriot and from 1765 he was active as the leader of the Sons of\r\nLiberty. He served in several major engagements in the American\r\nRevolution and in 1783 was brevetted a brigadier-general.[16]\r\n\r\nThe immigrant instrument makers were not confined to those working in\r\nglass, however. One of the earlier immigrant craftsmen was Charles\r\nBlundy, a London watchmaker who established himself on Church Street in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, in 1753. He notified the public that in\r\naddition to watches he sold thermometers of all sizes and types.\r\nPresumably his merchandise was imported from England.[17] He was absent\r\nfrom the city between 1753 and 1760 but returned and continued in\r\nbusiness in the latter year.\r\n\r\nAnother pre-Revolution immigrant was Thomas Harland (1735-1807), a clock\r\nmaker who settled in Norwich, Connecticut, in 1773. It is claimed that\r\nhe sailed from England on one of the ships carrying the tea destroyed by\r\nthe Boston Tea Party. Over the course of the years his business\r\nprospered to such a degree that he hired from ten to twelve apprentices\r\nat one time. Some of the leading American 18th-century clockmakers\r\nserved apprenticeships with Harland. In 1802 his newspaper notice stated\r\nthat he had for sale \"Surveyors Compasses, with agate centre needles;\r\nchains and Protractors ...\"[18]\r\n\r\nA most interesting instrument that has recently come to light is a brass\r\nsundial made in Philadelphia in 1764. The dial, about 10-1/2 inches in\r\ndiameter, is signed by the maker, \"Daniel Jay Philad^a. fecit.\" It is\r\ndated 1764 and inscribed with the name of the person for whom it was\r\nmade, \"James Pemberton.\" In the center is \"Lat. 40,\" which coincides\r\nwith the latitude for Philadelphia. The style of the dial is very much\r\nin the English tradition of the period, indicating that Jay was probably\r\nan emigrant trained in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Revolutionary Immigrant Makers\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the English craftsmen who came to the American\r\nColonies after the Revolution settled in Philadelphia, There was John\r\nGould for instance, a mathematical instrument maker from London who had\r\nopened a shop at 47 Water Street by 1794. He sold nautical, surveying,\r\nand optical instruments as well as mirrors, presumably all imported from\r\nEngland. He moved to 70 South Front Street \"At the Sign of the Quadrant\"\r\nin 1796. He was succeeded in business in 1798 by Thomas Whitney, another\r\nemigrant from London. Whitney made and sold instruments (see fig. 85) in\r\nGould's former shop, and featured also a vast array of department store\r\nmerchandise. John Whitney, who may have been his son, was listed at the\r\nsame address in the Philadelphia directory of 1801 as a \"Mathematical\r\nInstrument Maker and Optician.\"[19]\r\n\r\nIn the Philadelphia directory and register for 1821 Thomas Whitney\r\nadvertised that he\r\n\r\n     ... presents his sincere thanks to his friends and the public and\r\n     respectfully soliciting the continuation of their favors, wishes to\r\n     inform them that he has devoted his attention principally to the\r\n     making of surveying compasses for 16 years past, and has made 500\r\n     of them; the good qualities of which are well known to many\r\n     surveyors, in at least 16 of the States and Territories of the\r\n     Union ... [he also makes] many other instruments, protractors,\r\n     gunner's Calibers and quadrants, etc.\r\n\r\nGeorge Evans was another instrument maker who arrived from London after\r\nthe end of the Revolution. He established himself in a shop at 33 North\r\nFront Street in 1796, where he sold imported instruments as well as\r\nstationery, Bibles, and cloth. He died in 1798.[20]\r\n\r\nThomas Dring, who migrated from England, settled in Westtown Township of\r\nChester County, Pennsylvania, where he was first noted in the tax\r\nrecords of 1786. He married Hanna Griffith, a native of the region, and\r\ntheir son, Jeptha Dring, subsequently was mentioned as a carpenter by\r\ntrade, and a vagrant by inclination, who could quote Shakespeare from\r\nmemory. According to local legend, Dring raised money from a number of\r\ntownspeople for the purpose of purchasing clocks for them in England. He\r\nset sail for his homeland in about 1798 and never returned.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tax records for 1796 described Dring as an \"Optician\" he\r\nwas also a clockmaker and maker of scientific instruments. At least\r\nthree of his tall-case clocks have survived, and a stick type of\r\nbarometer which he made for Edward and Hannah Hicks in 1796. The\r\ninstrument is now in the collection of the Chester County Historical\r\nSociety. It measures 39 inches in height, and is signed on the\r\nthermometer dial THOMAS DRING/West Chester. This instrument (fig. 14) is\r\none of the very rare barometers produced in America in the 18th century.\r\n\r\nAnother craftsman who emigrated from England was Robert Clark, who\r\nopened a shop at 5-1/2 Church Street in Charleston, South Carolina, in\r\n1785. In that year he announced himself as a\r\n\r\n     Math., Optical and Philosophical Instruments maker and Clockmaker\r\n     from London ... As the Advertiser has lately had an opportunity of\r\n     working and receiving instruction under the first masters in the\r\n     above branches in Great Britain, flatters himself that he shall\r\n     give satisfaction to those who may be pleased to favor him with\r\n     their orders ... for Surveyors compasses, Quadrants, Telescopes,\r\n     Microscopes, Spirit Levels, etc.[21]\r\n\r\nW. Fosbrook was another craftsman originally from London. He was a\r\ncutler and maker of surgical instruments, with a shop in Beekman's Slip\r\nin New York City in 1786 or earlier. He specialized in leg irons and\r\nrupture trusses, and he made instruments and files for setting the\r\nteeth as well as standard items for surgeons.[22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--Barometer made in 1796 by Thomas Dring of\r\nWest Chester, Pa., for Edward and Hannah Hicks. Photo courtesy the\r\nChester County Historical Society.]\r\n\r\nSeveral immigrant instrument makers established themselves in\r\nPhiladelphia during the same period. John Denegan (or Donegan), stated\r\nto have been \"late from Italy,\" moved his shop in March 1787 to the\r\ncorner of Race and Fourth Streets at \"the sign of the Seven Stars\".[23]\r\nThere he made barometers and thermometers as well as glasses for\r\nphilosophical experiments. It seems too much of a coincidence that in\r\nOctober 1787 an instrument maker named Joseph Donegany established a\r\nshop at 54 Smith Street in New York City,[24] where--according to an\r\nadvertisement in the October 17, 1787, issue of _The New York Daily\r\nAdvertiser_--he made \"thermometers, barometers and sold hydrostatic\r\nBubbles and hygrometers for proving spirits, and also ... glasses for\r\nexperimental purposes.\" It is probable that Denegan and Donegany were\r\none and the same; since Denegan was stated to have been of Italian\r\norigin, the name may originally have been \"De Negani.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Gatty advertised himself as an \"Artist from Italy\" with a shop at\r\n341 Pearl Street in New York City where he \"made and sold every simple\r\nand compound form of barometer and thermometer as well as curious\r\nHygrometers for assaying spirits which show the actual strength with the\r\ngreatest precision and are not liable to be corroded, in addition to\r\nseveral new Philosophical Instruments of his own invention, and all\r\ntypes of artificial fireworks.\"[25] By 1796 Gatty (or Gatti?) had moved\r\nto Philadelphia where he had a shop at 79 South Front Street and\r\nadvertised the same items that had appeared in his advertisements in New\r\nYork. The Philadelphia directory for 1800 listed Gatty as a \"Weather\r\nGlass Maker.\"[26]\r\n\r\n\r\nNative American Makers\r\n\r\nComparatively speaking, the greater proportion of the early American\r\ninstrument makers were native born. Among these were to be found a\r\nsubstantial number of artisans trained as clockmakers who subsequently\r\nproduced scientific instruments to meet the surveying and nautical needs\r\nof their communities. Together with the other craftsmen throughout the\r\ncolonies who established and advertised themselves specifically as\r\ninstrument makers, they produced a large number of the mathematical\r\ninstruments used in the American Colonies in the 18th century. A careful\r\nstudy of their regional distribution reveals that most of them were\r\nconcentrated in the major coastal cities of commerce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--James Wilson, first American maker of globes.\r\nFrom a sketch by John Ross Dix in _Ballou's Pictorial Drawing Room\r\nCompanion_ (Boston, 1857), vol. 12, p. 156.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Hampshire_\r\n\r\nAmong the artisans who combined clockmaking with instrument making\r\nbefore the beginning of the 19th century was Benjamin C. Gilman\r\n(1763-1835) of Exeter, New Hampshire. He made mathematical instruments\r\nand clocks in addition to working as a silversmith, clockmaker, and\r\nhydraulic engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vermont_\r\n\r\nA New England instrument maker who had a most unusual career was James\r\nWilson (1763-1855) of Bradford, Vermont. He was a native of Francestown,\r\nNew Hampshire, where he was born in a log cabin and brought up on a\r\nfarm. In 1796 he purchased his own farm, at Bradford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--Globe made by James Wilson (1763-1855) of\r\nBradford, Vermont. Diameter is 13 in. Photo courtesy Houghton Library,\r\nHarvard University.]\r\n\r\nWhen a young man of 36 he saw a pair of globes at Dartmouth College in\r\nneighboring Hanover and tried to duplicate them. He made balls of wood\r\nturned from solid blocks, covered them with paper, and finished them off\r\nwith lines and drawings. He later improved this method by coating the\r\nwooden balls thickly with layers of paper pasted together. He then cut\r\nthe globes into hemispheres, removed the wooden molds, and joined the\r\npaper shells to make the globes.\r\n\r\nWilson next proceeded to procure copper plates of the necessary sizes\r\nfor his globes, and he projected his maps on them in sections. He\r\nreceived a few lessons in engraving from Amos Doolittle of New Haven,\r\nbut he was otherwise completely self-taught.\r\n\r\nWilson exhibited the first edition of his globes in Boston in 1814. They\r\ncreated a sensation, and many persons asked to see the maker, but Wilson\r\nwas reluctant to come forward because of his coarse clothing and rustic\r\nmanners. He was greatly encouraged, however, by the public interest in\r\nhis work, and he continued to make globes in Bradford (see fig. 16). In\r\nabout 1815 Wilson and his three sons, all of whom were as ingenious as\r\nthe father, formed a company to manufacture globes in Albany. There they\r\nproduced terrestrial and celestial globes, the latter showing as many as\r\n5,000 stars. Wilson produced a new set of plates in 1826 and made globes\r\nin several sizes. Even after he had reached the age of 83 years he\r\nconstructed an excellent planetarium, engraving the large copperplate\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWilson was married three times and was the father of 14 children. He\r\ndied at the age of 92 in March 1855 at Bradford.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Massachusetts_\r\n\r\nA surprisingly small number of the Massachusetts craftsmen working\r\nbefore the end of the 18th century produced scientific instruments.\r\nAmong the very earliest were several members of the King family of\r\nSalem. Daniel King (1704-1790) was born in Salem on November 17, 1704.\r\nAt the time of his death Rev. William Bentley spoke of him as a \"maker\r\nof Mathematical Instruments\" and a \"teacher of Mathematics.\"[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--Brass surveying compass made by Stephen\r\nGreenleaf (fl. 1745) of Boston. Photo courtesy New Hampshire Historical\r\nSociety, Concord.]\r\n\r\nFollowing Daniel's death, his business in instruments was inherited by\r\nhis son Benjamin King (1740-1804), of Salem. Benjamin specialized in\r\nproducing nautical instruments, and several of his Davis quadrants have\r\nsurvived in public collections. When he died on December 26, 1804,\r\nReverend Bentley wrote that King was \"... a Mathematical Instrument\r\nmaker, in that branch which immediately regarded practical navigation by\r\nquadrant and compass. He supported a very good character through life &\r\nwas much esteemed.\"[29]\r\n\r\nAnother of the very early mathematical instrument makers in\r\nMassachusetts was Stephen Greenleaf (see fig. 17), who kept a shop on\r\nQueen Street opposite the prison in Boston where\r\n\r\n     He makes and Mends all Sorts of Mathematical Instruments, as\r\n     Theodolites, Spirit Levels, Semicircles, Circumferences, and\r\n     Protractors, Horizontal and Equinoctial Sun Dials, Azimuth and\r\n     Amplitude Compasses, Elliptical and Triangular Compasses, and all\r\n     sorts of Common Compasses ... N.B. He sets Load Stones on Silver or\r\n     Brass, after the best manner.[30]\r\n\r\nJonathan Dakin worked as a mathematical balance-maker \"at the Sign of\r\nthe Hand & Beam, opposite to Dr. Colman's Meeting House\" where he made a\r\nvariety of scale beams in 1745.[31]\r\n\r\nAn interesting advertisement by Rowland Houghton appeared in the January\r\n17-24, 1737, issue of the _Boston Gazette_. Houghton announced that he\r\nhad \"lately improv'd on his new Theodolite, by which the Art of\r\nSurveying is rendered more plain & easy than heretofore.\" Houghton was\r\nactive in the political scene in Boston, as evidenced by the fact that\r\nin various issues of the _Boston Gazette_ for January and February 1739\r\nhe is listed variously as \"Commissioner,\" \"Proprietors' Clerk\" and as\r\n\"Collector.\"\r\n\r\nIsaac Greenwood, Jr. (1730-1803), was born at Cambridge, where he\r\nmarried Mary I'ams in 1757. He maintained a shop where he combined the\r\nbusiness of mathematical instrument maker and ivory turner, and also\r\nimported hardware. After the Revolution, he engaged in dentistry,\r\nspecializing in making artificial teeth and in the manufacture of\r\n\"umbrilloes.\" Paul Revere apparently did printing for him on five\r\ndifferent occasions between 1762 and 1774, and in about 1771 engraved\r\nhis trade card, which read:\r\n\r\n     ISAAC GREENWOOD, Ivory Turner Next door to Doctor John Clark's at\r\n     the North End Boston. Turns all sorts of work in Ivory, Silver,\r\n     Brass, Iron, Horn, Wood, etc. Such as Billiard Balls, Tea Boards,\r\n     Scallop^d and Plain Salvers, Decanters ...[32]\r\n\r\nIsaac's father, Isaac Greenwood, Sr., was \"Professor of Mathematicks and\r\nNatural and Experimental Philosophy\" at Harvard. In the _Boston Gazette_\r\nfor February 19-26, 1728, there appeared the following notice of his\r\ninstallation:\r\n\r\n     On the 13th of this Month at Ten in the Morning, The Honorable &\r\n     Reverend Overseers of the College at Cambridge, met the Corporation\r\n     in the College Hall, to Inaugurate Mr. Isaac Greenwood into the\r\n     Office of Professor of the Mathematicks, and Natural and\r\n     Experimental Philosophy, lately founded by that great and living\r\n     Benefactor to this Society, Mr. Thomas Hollis of London Merchant.\r\n     The Rev. President being detain'd by illness, Mr. Flint the Senior\r\n     Fellow perform'd the part of Moderator, began with Prayer, and then\r\n     Pronounc'd a Latin Oration proper to the Occasion: Mr. Wiggleworth\r\n     Divinity Professor, read the Founders Instructions. Mr. Greenwood\r\n     took the Oaths and made the Declarations required in them: and\r\n     pronounc'd a Latin Oration. The Rev. Mr. Appleton Pray'd: and\r\n     Singing part of the 104 Psalm concluded the Solemnity. After which\r\n     the Overseers & Corporation repair'd to the Library; till the\r\n     Publick Dinner in the Hall was ready, where all the Gentlemen\r\n     Spectators of the Solemnity were hansomely Entertained.\r\n\r\nGreenwood continued to teach privately for a decade. In various issues\r\nof _The Boston Gazette_ of 1738 and 1739 he featured an advertisement,\r\nthe text of which always stated:\r\n\r\n     Such as are desirous of learning any Part of Practical or\r\n     Theoretical Mathematics may be taught by Isaac Greenwood, A.M. &c.\r\n     in Clark's Square, near the North Meeting House, where Attendance\r\n     will be given between the Hours of 9 and 12 in the Forenoon, and 2\r\n     and 5 in the Afternoons.\r\n\r\n     N.B. Instructions may also be had in any Branch of Natural\r\n     Philosophy, when there is a sufficient Number to attend.[33]\r\n\r\nJohn Bailey II (1752-1823) of Hanover and Lynn, Massachusetts worked as\r\na clockmaker from about 1770. His father, John Bailey I, and his\r\nbrothers Calvin and Lebbeus also were clockmakers. Bailey married Mary\r\nHall of Berwick, Maine, and settled in Hanover where he made scientific\r\ninstruments and clocks. A brass surveying compass in the collection of\r\nthe New York Historical Society is inscribed \"J. BAILEY HANOVER\r\n1804.\"[34]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best known instrument maker in Massachusetts was Joseph\r\nPope (1750-1826), of Boston, who was described by contemporaries as the\r\n\"local mathematician, watch-maker and mechanical genius.\" In 1787 he\r\ncompleted the construction of a gear-driven orrery displaying the\r\nmotions of the solar system in a horizontal plane with eccentric and\r\ninclined orbits. At each of the twelve corners were mounted cast bronze\r\nfigures, claimed to have been carved in wood by Simeon Skillin and cast\r\nin bronze by Paul Revere. Although the instrument was made for Harvard,\r\nthe university lacked funds for its purchase. Accordingly, it held a\r\npublic lottery which realized a substantial sum in excess of the\r\nL450.3.0 paid to Pope, and the orrery was delivered in December\r\n1788.[35] The orrery (fig. 18) has survived and is part of the\r\ncollection of historical scientific instruments at Harvard University.\r\n\r\nAccording to a statement in the _Boston Gazette_ for February 16, 1789,\r\nan apparatus for displaying planets in their proper orbits by means of\r\nwires was made and exhibited in Boston by Bartholomew Burges.\r\n\r\nMention must also be made of several members of the Folger family of\r\nNantucket, Massachusetts. Peter Folger (1617-1690), founder of the\r\nAmerican branch of the family, emigrated from Norfolk, England, in 1635\r\nand occupied himself in Nantucket as blacksmith, schoolmaster,\r\nwatchmaker, and surveyor. He was a grandfather of Benjamin Franklin.\r\nAnother notable descendant was Maria Mitchell (1818-1889), professor of\r\nastronomy and director of the observatory at Vassar College.\r\n\r\nThe best known member of the family was Walter Folger, Jr. (1765-1849),\r\na self-taught clockmaker and watchmaker with great interest in the\r\nsciences. A telescope that he produced about 1818 was considered to be\r\nthe finest in the country at that time. His greatest achievement was a\r\ntall case astronomical clock that he devised and constructed; it was\r\ncompleted in 1790 and is considered to be the most complicated domestic\r\nclock on record.[36] Folger also produced quadrants and compasses, and\r\nmade astronomical observations. His observations of the solar eclipse of\r\nSeptember 17, 1811, were published in 1815 in _Memoirs of the Academy of\r\nArts and Sciences_.\r\n\r\nProbably one of the most significant of the surviving early American\r\nscientific instruments is a pair of gunners' calipers made and used by\r\nPAUL REVERE (1735-1818) of Boston. The calipers are made of incised\r\nbrass, measuring 7 inches in length and 1-3/4 inches in width. They are\r\nsigned on the reverse side with the name \"Revere\" in the style of script\r\nsignature used by this maker in many of his engravings. The design of\r\nthe instrument is substantially different from that which is commonly\r\nfound in English, French, and German gunners' calipers of the period,\r\nand was probably Revere's own. (See figs. 19, 20.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--Orrery by Joseph Pope completed in 1787 for\r\nHarvard University. Engraved plates and bronze figures were made by Paul\r\nRevere. The orrery is 6-1/2 ft. in diameter and 6-1/2 ft. high. The\r\ntwelve figures at the corners are said to have been carved in wood by\r\nSimeon Skillin and cast in bronze by Paul Revere. Photo courtesy Harvard\r\nUniversity.]\r\n\r\nIt is believed that these calipers, which are preserved in the\r\ncollection of the Bostonian Society in Boston, were probably used by\r\nRevere in 1775-1776. This was the period during which he was in charge\r\nof ordnance repairs for the Continental Army, and involved in various\r\nventures for the manufacture of gunpowder and the casting of cannon.\r\nThere is no evidence of other scientific instruments made by Revere,\r\nlending some weight to the belief that these calipers were made for his\r\nown use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--Brass gunnery calipers made and probably used\r\nby Paul Revere (1735-1818). The calipers are 7 in. long and 1-3/4 in.\r\nwide.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--Reverse side of gunnery calipers, showing the\r\ninscribed signature. Photos courtesy the Bostonian Society, Boston,\r\nMass.]\r\n\r\nOther Massachusetts instrument makers include Gideon Fairman (1774-1827)\r\nof Newburyport who was a partner of William Hooker in the firm of Hooker\r\n& Fairman, which dealt in mathematical instruments before 1810.[37]\r\nFairman later moved to Philadelphia, where he was associated with the\r\nengraving firm of Draper, Murray & Fairman.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 18th century Samuel Emery was making mathematical\r\ninstruments in Salem, at the same time that John Jayne was engaged in\r\nthe same work in that community.[38]\r\n\r\nJohn Potter of Brookfield, Massachusetts, produced surveying instruments\r\nin the last quarter of the 18th century. A graphometer signed with his\r\nname and dated 1785 is in the collection of the firm of W. & L. E.\r\nGurley in Troy, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rhode Island_\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and most important of the instrument makers of Rhode\r\nIsland was Benjamin King (1707-1786), of Newport. He was the son of\r\nCapt. Samuel King of Salem, Massachusetts, where he was born and\r\nbaptized on March 13, 1707. He was a brother of Daniel King of Salem.\r\nBenjamin eventually moved to Newport, where he married Mary Hagger in\r\nJuly 1742. They had four children: Benjamin, Mehitable, Samuel, and\r\nMary. He established himself as a respectable businessman in the\r\ncommunity, and in 1759 or 1760 he became the senior partner in the\r\nimporting and retailing firm of King & Hagger, \"near the sign of Mr.\r\nPitt,\" dealing in general merchandise, mathematical and nautical\r\ninstruments, and stationery. William Hagger was probably the junior\r\npartner, and may have been King's brother-in-law. King began making his\r\nown instruments for sale, surviving examples dated as early as 1762. The\r\npartnership was dissolved early in the 1760's. In 1766 Benjamin King was\r\nimporting, making, and selling quadrants and other instruments \"At the\r\nSign of the Mathematical Instruments\" next to the Golden Eagle on Thames\r\nStreet. His son Samuel King occupied the same premises, where he dealt\r\nin paints and artists supplies.\r\n\r\nWhen the British occupied Newport, King moved to North Kingstown, but he\r\nreturned after the British vacated the city. He was 79 when he died in\r\n1786, and his son Samuel King succeeded him in business.[39]\r\n\r\nWilliam Guyse Hagger (c. 1744-1830?), born in Newport, is believed to\r\nhave been the son of William Hagar and Mary Knowlton. He was a quadrant\r\nmaker (see fig. 21). In 1774 he headed a household that consisted of\r\nhis wife, five children, and a colored servant. Whether it was he or his\r\nfather who was the partner of Benjamin King cannot be determined with\r\ncertainty. When Newport was occupied by the British, Hagger moved to\r\nCranston, where he joined the Pawtuxet Rangers and served as a sentinel\r\nat Pawtuxet Fort in 1778. No members of the Hagger family appear in the\r\n1790 census of Newport, but a William Hager is reported as having died\r\nin Boston in 1830 at the age of 82. It seems likely from the age and\r\ndates that it was William Hagger the elder who worked as a partner in\r\nthe firm of King & Hagger, which was established in 1759 or 1760.[40]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--Davis quadrant or backstaff made and signed\r\nby William Guyse Hagger of Newport, Rhode Island, about 1760-1770. USNM\r\n319029.]\r\n\r\nAnother instrument maker of Rhode Island was William Hamlin (1772-1869).\r\nHe had established himself in Providence by the beginning of the 19th\r\ncentury in the manufacturing and repairing of mathematical and nautical\r\ninstruments, for which there was an active market in that city. Hamlin\r\nwas one of the first engravers in America and the first in Rhode Island.\r\nHe designed and engraved banknotes for many banks in the State and for\r\nother institutions. At the same time he carried on a general trade in\r\nthe sale of musical instruments. Hamlin moved his shop several times,\r\nbut from 1847 until his death he worked at \"The Sign of the Quadrant\"\r\n(see fig. 22) at 131 South Water Street. He was equally interested in\r\noptics and astronomy, and it has been claimed that he constructed the\r\nfirst telescope in America. It is well established that he worked for\r\nmany years to perfect a reflecting telescope for his own use.[41]\r\n\r\nInstruments were made also by Paul Pease, who may have been the husband\r\nof the daughter of Nathaniel Folger of Nantucket. This Elizabeth Folger\r\nPease, wife of a Paul Pease, was born in 1720 and died in 1795. Little\r\nis known about Pease except for the name \"Paul Pease 1750\" inscribed on\r\na quadrant in the collection of the Rhode Island Historical Society.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Connecticut_\r\n\r\nThe clockmakers who worked in Connecticut during the span of the 18th\r\ncentury numbered almost a hundred. Yet only a half dozen appear on\r\nrecord to have made or sold instruments in addition to clocks. Among\r\nthese were several members of the Doolittle family, including Isaac\r\nDoolittle (1721-1800) of New Haven. In 1763 he advertised that he sold\r\nsurveying compasses in addition to clocks, watches, bar iron, and\r\nchocolate.[43] His son Isaac Doolittle, Jr. (1759-1821), also of New\r\nHaven, established a shop of his own, which he advertised in 1781 as\r\nhaving\r\n\r\n     Compasses of all kinds, both for sea and land, surveyors scales,\r\n     and protractors, gauging rods, walking sticks, silver and plated\r\n     buttons, turned upon horn; also clocks and watches made and\r\n     repaired ...[44]\r\n\r\nAlthough not very active as a clockmaker, Isaac Jr. appears to have\r\nspecialized more in the production of surveying and nautical\r\ninstruments. He took over his father's business just before the latter's\r\ndeath, and in 1799 he advertised[45]:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--Trade cards of William Hamlin (1772-1869),\r\nengraver and instrument maker of Providence, Rhode Island. In collection\r\nof Rhode Island Historical Society, Providence.]\r\n\r\n     The subscriber having commenced business at the shop lately\r\n     occupied by Mr. Isaac Doolittle, in Chapel Street, where he repairs\r\n     watches, makes and repairs Surveyors Compasses and Chains, Brass\r\n     Amplitude, plain brass and common Ship's Compasses, Gauging Rods,\r\n     Quadrants, repair'd &c. every favor gratefully received by the\r\n     public's humble servant, Isaac Doolittle, jun.\r\n\r\nEnos Doolittle (1751-1806), a nephew of Isaac Doolittle, Sr., made,\r\nsold, cleaned, and repaired clocks and surveying and marine compasses\r\nfrom 1772 through 1788 at his shop in Hartford. He also sold these items\r\nthrough agents in Saybrook and Middleton.[46]\r\n\r\nOne of the best known of the Connecticut clockmakers was Peregrine White\r\n(1747-1834), of Woodstock. White was a descendant of the first Pilgrim\r\nchild, and a native of Boston. After serving an apprenticeship, he\r\nworked as a clockmaker and silversmith in Boston. He was accused of\r\nforging silver spoons and left the city to settle in Woodstock. He\r\nestablished his own shop west of Muddy Brook Village.[47] In addition to\r\nfine tall-case clocks, for which he was noted, White also produced\r\nsurveying compasses, one of which is in the collection of the U.S.\r\nNational Museum (fig. 23). A similar specimen in Old Sturbridge Village\r\nis reputed to have been used for surveying the town of Southbridge,\r\nMass.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Hanks (1755-1824), of Mansfield and Litchfield, inserted a\r\nnotice in a newspaper in 1808 to notify the public that he and his son\r\nTruman Hanks, in partnership, had \"surveyors compasses upon the\r\nRittenhouse improved plan\" in addition to such other commodities as\r\nbrass cannon, bells from their own foundry, clocks, goldsmith's items,\r\nand stocking looms.[48]\r\n\r\nZiba Blakslee (1768-1834), of Newton, worked as a clockmaker, goldsmith,\r\nand bell founder and he advertised that he made and sold surveying\r\ninstruments.[49]\r\n\r\nIn New Haven, Clark Sibley and Simeon Marble organized the firm of\r\nSibley & Marble and advertised that in addition to repairing swords and\r\ncutlasses, clocks and watches, they also repaired mathematical and\r\nsurgical instruments.[50]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--Brass surveying compass made about 1790 by\r\nPeregrine White (1747-1834) of Woodstock, Connecticut. USNM 388993.]\r\n\r\nOne of the instrument makers of New England who has remained relatively\r\nunknown was Benjamin Platt (1757-1833), who was born in Danbury,\r\nConnecticut, on January 3, 1757.[51] He married Adah Fairchild of the\r\nsame city in 1776, and it is believed that he must have completed his\r\napprenticeship by that date inasmuch as apprentices usually were not\r\nallowed to marry.\r\n\r\nIt is not known how long Platt worked in his native city, but by 1780 he\r\nhad moved to Litchfield, where he worked in gold, silver, and brass. He\r\nbecame established as a clockmaker and produced tall case clocks and\r\nother types. In 1787 he was in New Milford, a town adjacent to Danbury,\r\nwhere he produced surveying compasses (see fig. 24). Three years later,\r\nin 1790, he was at Milford, where he invented a \"Compass for measuring\r\ndistance in hilly country.\" In 1793 he returned to New Milford, where he\r\nmade a clock to order for Eli Todd, and by 1800 he had moved to\r\nLanesboro, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ohio_\r\n\r\nBenjamin Platt was the migratory type. In 1817 he migrated from\r\nLanesboro to Columbus, Ohio. His son, Augustus Platt (1793-1886), also\r\nmade mathematical instruments (see fig. 25) in Columbus. In 1809 a\r\ngrandson, named William Augustus Platt was born. When the child's mother\r\ndied, Benjamin and Adah Platt adopted the boy, and when he came of age\r\nhe went into the watchmaking trade. William Platt married Fanny Hayes,\r\nsister of President Hayes.[52] His shop was listed in the 1843 city\r\ndirectory; it was the first jewelry and clock and watch store in the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of instrument making in Ohio is found in the\r\nreport of a missionary, John Heckewelder. He mentioned the brothers\r\nJoseph and Francois Devacht who worked as watchmakers and instrument\r\nmakers in Gallipolis, Ohio. Writing in 1792, Heckewelder stated that\r\n\"the most interesting shops of the Workmen [in Gallipolis] were those of\r\nthe Goldsmiths and Watchmakers. They showed us work on watches,\r\ncompasses, sundials finer than I have ever beheld.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--Brass surveying compass made by Benjamin\r\nPlatt (1757-1833) of New Milford, Connecticut, about 1795-1800.

Photos courtesy\r\nOhio State Museum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York_\r\n\r\nThere were relatively few makers of mathematical instruments in New York\r\nCity before the end of the 18th century. Perhaps the earliest was John\r\nBailey, who moved from Fredericksburg, Virginia, to Fishkill, New York,\r\nin 1778. He was a cutler by trade, and he made and sold surgical\r\ninstruments.[53]\r\n\r\n\"Bulmain & Dennies\" at 59 Water Street in New York were the appointed\r\nagents to sell the \"Perpetual Log or Distance Clock to find a ship's way\r\nat sea.\" The device had been patented in the United States, and one of\r\nthe instruments was displayed at the bar of the Tontine Coffee House,\r\naccording to an advertisement in the July 23, 1799, issue of the _New\r\nYork Gazette and General Advertiser_.\r\n\r\nH. Caritat, at 153 Broadway in New York, imported and sold \"The\r\nPlanispherical Planetarium.\" This item was described in an\r\nadvertisement[54] as \"a graphic representation of the earth, in twelve\r\nparticular positions during its revolutionary course around the sun, as\r\nalso of the Moon's revolution around the earth, together with literal\r\ndescription of parts and motions, etc.\" The advertisement also stated\r\nthat Caritat sold \"Carey's newly improved Terrestrial and Celestial\r\nGlobes which omitted the Constellary Configurations.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 25.--Surveying theodolite made by Augustus Platt\r\n(1793-1886) of Columbus, Ohio, in the early 19th century. Photo courtesy\r\nOhio State Museum.]\r\n\r\nIn 1785 M. Morris of New York City made and sold his own invention of a\r\n\"Nautical Protractor for the price of One Dollar.\" In an advertisement\r\nin _The Independent Journal or the General Advertiser_ of May 25, 1785,\r\nhe explained that the device was for use in the construction of globular\r\nmaps and Mercator charts. He also made another protractor for attaching\r\nto the end of a ruler for measuring distances on charts. He planned to\r\npublish a treatise on the subject of his inventions.\r\n\r\nJames Youle, a cutler and mechanician with a shop located first on Fly\r\nStreet and then at 64 Water Street \"at the Sign of the Cross-Knives and\r\nGun,\" sold a large variety of cutlery and hardware for gun repair. He\r\nalso made surgical instruments. He died in February 1786 at the age of\r\n46 as the result of an injury to his chest from a breaking grindstone\r\nwhile working in his shop. He was survived by a widow and nine children\r\nand was succeeded in business by his son John Youle.[55]\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Jersey_\r\n\r\nOne of the few instrument makers known to have worked in New Jersey was\r\nAaron Miller of \"Elizabeth-town.\" He was first noted in the New York\r\nnewspapers in 1748 when he notified the public that, in addition to\r\nclocks, he made compasses, chains for surveyors, and church bells, for\r\nwhich he maintained his own foundry. When he died in 1771 he left all\r\nhis tools to a son-in-law, Isaac Brokaw.[56]\r\n\r\nAnother craftsman who is entitled to being included as an instrument\r\nmaker was Richard Wistar. When Casper Wistar died in 1752, his son\r\nRichard succeeded him as owner of the famous glass works. In addition to\r\nwindow glass and glassware, Richard Wistar also produced such special\r\nproducts as retorts for use in chemistry and \"electerizing globes and\r\ntubes,\" as well as bottles for Leyden jars that Benjamin Franklin had\r\nurged him to attempt in the early 1750's.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Delaware_\r\n\r\nGeorge Crow (ca. 1725-1771/72) of Wilmington, Delaware, was apparently\r\nwell established as a clockmaker in the community by the time of his\r\nmarriage in 1746 to Mary Laudonet. They had four children, and Crow's\r\ntwo sons followed his trade. George Crow was active in civic affairs,\r\nand in addition to clocks, he produced surveying compasses, several of\r\nwhich have survived.[58]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maryland and Virginia_\r\n\r\nBrief mention has already been made of the Chandlee family of\r\nclockmakers and instrument makers of the 18th century. The founder of\r\nthe line and first of interest was Benjamin Chandlee, Sr., who migrated\r\nin 1702 from Ireland to Philadelphia, where he was apprenticed to Abel\r\nCottey, clockmaker, and eventually married his daughter. His son\r\nBenjamin Chandlee, Jr. (1723-1791), worked as a clockmaker in\r\nNottingham, Maryland, where he produced instruments as well as clocks. A\r\nfine example of a brass surveying compass--inscribed with his name, and\r\nwhich is believed to have been made for the Gilpin family in about\r\n1761--is on exhibition in the Chester County Historical Society. He had\r\nfour sons, and a few years before his death he established the firm of\r\nChandlee & Sons, the name of which was changed to Ellis Chandlee &\r\nBrothers a year before he died.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of Benjamin Jr.'s four sons was Goldsmith Chandlee\r\n(c.1746-1821). After serving an apprenticeship with his father,\r\nGoldsmith moved to Virginia and worked near Stephensburg (now Stephens\r\nCity). He eventually established himself at Winchester and built a brass\r\nfoundry and a shop where he produced clocks, surveying compasses,\r\nsundials, apothecary and money scales, surgical instruments, compasses,\r\ntelescopes, and other items in metal. Numerous examples of his clocks\r\nand instruments have survived. Their fine quality attests to the claim\r\nthat he was one of the foremost craftsmen of the 18th century. Several\r\nof his surveying compasses exist in modern collections. An instrument\r\n(fig. 26) that he made about 1794 for a surveyor named Robert Lyle is in\r\nthe writer's collection; an almost identical instrument that Chandlee\r\nmade for Lawrence Augustine Washington, George Washington's nephew, is\r\nexhibited in the library at Mount Vernon, Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26.--The label of Goldsmith Chandlee. In the\r\ncollection of Ohio Historical Society, Ohio State Museum.]\r\n\r\nEllis Chandlee (1755-1816) also was apprenticed to his father, and he\r\nworked with his brothers in the shop. He established the firm of Ellis\r\nChandlee & Brothers, in 1790, shortly before his father's death. The\r\nfirm was dissolved in 1797 when the youngest brother, John Chandlee,\r\nleft the firm. Ellis continued in partnership with his other brother,\r\nIsaac Chandlee (1760-1813), until about 1804, producing clocks,\r\nsurveying instruments, and other metal articles. Their products were\r\nsigned \"Ellis and Isaac Chandlee, Nottingham,\" or, in the case of a\r\nsurveying compass in the collection of the Chester County Historical\r\nSociety, \"E. & I. Chandlee, Nottingham.\" Isaac Chandlee also produced\r\nclocks and instruments under his own name only, for there are a number\r\nof surviving clocks and surveying compasses signed in such manner (see\r\nfig. 28).[59]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.--Brass surveying compass with outkeeper made\r\nby Goldsmith Chandlee (c. 1746-1821) of Winchester, Virginia, for Robert\r\nLyle. Over-all length, 14-1/2 in.; diameter, 7 in. Instrument, in\r\noriginal wooden case, bears ink signature of Robert Lyle. In collection\r\nof the writer.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important craftsmen of Maryland was Frederick A. Heisely\r\n(1759-1839). A native of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, he served an\r\napprenticeship there with John Hoff, the master clockmaker, from 1777 to\r\n1783. Heisely served in the Revolution. In 1783, presumably upon the\r\ncompletion of his apprenticeship, he married Catherine Hoff, the\r\nclockmaker's daughter. He moved to Frederick, Maryland, where he\r\nestablished his own clockmaking shop and where he specialized in making\r\nmathematical instruments. A tower clock made in Frederick is in the\r\ncollection of the U.S. National Museum. Heisely returned to Lancaster to\r\nbecome Hoff's partner, and worked with him until 1802. He then moved his\r\nshop to Harrisburg and worked there until 1820. He moved once more, this\r\ntime to Pittsburgh where he advertised himself as a \"Clock, Watch and\r\nInstrument Maker,\" with a shop at No. 6 St. Clair Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28.--Brass surveying compass made by Goldsmith\r\nChandlee for Laurence Augustine Washington in about 1795. In the library\r\nat Mount Vernon. Photo courtesy the Mount Vernon Ladies Association of\r\nthe Union.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Heisely (1789-1880), Frederick's son, who was born at Frederick,\r\nMaryland, achieved note in his own right as a maker of clocks and\r\ninstruments. He worked at Second and Walnut Streets in Harrisburg. He\r\nis credited with being the person who selected the melody of \"To\r\nAnacreon in Heaven\" for \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" while he was serving\r\nas a member of the Pennsylvania State Militia.[60]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania_\r\n\r\nA number of instrument makers worked in Philadelphia, which was one of\r\nthe important shipping centers during the 18th century and consequently\r\none of the important markets for nautical instruments.\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest Philadelphia instrument maker of record was Thomas\r\nGodfrey (1704-1749) who was born in Bristol Township. After serving an\r\napprenticeship, Godfrey developed his own business as a glazier and\r\nplumber. He is stated to have done the major part of the glazing of the\r\nState House in 1732, as well as similar work on Christ Church. He also\r\nworked for Andrew Hamilton and for James Logan.\r\n\r\nGodfrey had a natural inclination and interest in science and\r\nmathematics, which may have been further encouraged by his friendship\r\nwith Benjamin Franklin, who resided in the same house. Godfrey was also\r\na fellow member of Franklin's Junto.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 Godfrey invented an improved backstaff or Davis quadrant, and\r\nloaned the instrument to Joshua Fisher to be used in the latter's survey\r\nof Delaware Bay. It is claimed that the location of Cape Henlopen was\r\nestablished on Fisher's map (published in London in 1756) by means of\r\nGodfrey's instrument. James Logan became interested in the improved\r\nbackstaff invented by Godfrey and at Logan's request, the instrument was\r\ntaken on a voyage to the West Indies by a Captain Wright for the purpose\r\nof testing it.[61]\r\n\r\nAt the same time Logan sent a description of the instrument to London to\r\nthe Royal Astronomer, Edmund Halley. No acknowledgment was made, and in\r\n1734 Logan sent a second description to Sir Hans Sloane and to Peter\r\nCollison for forwarding to the Royal Society. The arrival of this\r\ndescription coincided with the submission of the description of a\r\nsimilar instrument to the Society by its vice president, James Hadley.\r\nThe Royal Society decided in favor of both inventors, and Godfrey was\r\nawarded the equivalent of 200 pounds in household furniture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 29.--Brass surveying compass made by Isaac\r\nChandlee (1760-1813) of Nottingham, Maryland. Photo courtesy Ohio State\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nGodfrey is often confused with his son, also named Thomas Godfrey\r\n(1736-1763), who worked as a watchmaker in Philadelphia, and\r\nsubsequently became active in literary arts.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Condy (fl. 1756-1792, d. 1798) was an instrument maker with a\r\nshop on South Front Street in Philadelphia. As early as 1756 he worked\r\nfor most of the merchant shippers of the port, supplying them with a\r\nconsiderable number of sand glasses that ranged from the quarter-minute\r\nto the two-hour varieties. Although he made his own mathematical\r\ninstruments, it is likely that he imported the sand glasses. According\r\nto Customs House clearances of 1789, he had imported from London on the\r\nship _Pigou_ \"three cases of merchandise\" valued at L160/17/6 with a\r\nduty of $32.19, which may have included sand glasses.[62]\r\n\r\nWhen Condy retired in 1792 he was succeeded in business by Thomas Biggs\r\nat the same address. Biggs had originally served an apprenticeship with\r\nCondy, and then fought for the American cause in the Revolution for five\r\nyears. Following the termination of his military service he had engaged\r\nin instrument making in New York for eight years before returning to\r\nPhiladelphia, his native city. Biggs prospered and his advertisements\r\ncontinued until early in 1795.\r\n\r\nThomas Pryor made instruments in a shop on Chestnut Street in 1778, but\r\nhe evidently retired from business in the 1790's because the city\r\ndirectory of 1795 listed him merely as \"gentleman.\" He is reported to\r\nhave been one of those who, from the State House Yard, witnessed the\r\ntransit of Venus.[63]\r\n\r\nAmong the early makers of mathematical instruments in Philadelphia\r\nwas William Dean (?-1797), who is believed to have been working in that\r\ncity as early as 1778. His name first appears in local directories in\r\nJune 1792, where his shop address was listed as No. 43 South Front\r\nStreet. Later he advertised that he made and sold \"Surveying\r\ninstruments--Telescopes, Sextants, Quadrants--and every article\r\nrequisite for navigation, surveying, levelling, &c....\"\r\n\r\nAccording to details which were noted in his last will, which was dated\r\nJune 1, 1797, and filed and proved in the following month, Dean's death\r\nappears to have been preceded by a long illness. He designated his two\r\nsisters as his executrices, and the fact that his will specified the\r\nappointment of a Mr. Thomas Yardley, Jr., as guardian of his three\r\nchildren indicates that he may have been a widower at the time of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nA surveying compass by this maker was recently brought to light in, the\r\nClark County Historical Society, Springfield, Ohio, by Dr. Donald A.\r\nHutzlar of the Ohio State Museum. The instrument is a plain compass in\r\nbrass without levels, 13-1/2 inches in length, and with a 5-inch needle.\r\nThe dial is marked \"DEAN PHILAD^a.\" The wooden cover for the instrument\r\nis marked with the names of previous owners and dates, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Jno. C. Symes, Aug. 10, 1778\r\n    I. Ludlow, 1791\r\n    Henry Donnel, July 24, 1794\r\n    Jonathan Donnel, 1796\r\n    John Dyherty\r\n    Thomas J. Kizer, 1838\r\n    David J. Kizer, '78.\r\n\r\nA description of this instrument in \"_The History of Clark County,\r\nOhio_\" by A. P. Steele, published in 1881 by the W. H. Beers Co. of\r\nChicago, adds considerably to its interest as a historical record of\r\nAmerican scientific instruments and their use: \"Col. Thomas Kizer, the\r\nveteran surveyor, has in his possession a compass made by Dean of\r\nPhiladelphia; this instrument was owned and used by his father, David\r\nKizer, who obtained it from John Dougherty about 1813; Dougherty got it\r\nfrom Jonathan Donnel. This relic is marked I. Ludlow, 1791; Henry\r\nDonnel, 1794; J. Donnel, 1796, John Dougherty, 1799; these marks are\r\nrudely scratched upon the cover of the instrument, and bear every\r\nevidence of being genuine; there is no doubt but that this old compass\r\nwas used in making the first surveys in this county, or that it is the\r\nidentical instrument used by John Dougherty, in laying off Demint's\r\nfirst plat of Springfield, and by Jonathan Donnel on the survey of 'New\r\nBoston.'\" It is to be noted that some discrepancies exist in the listing\r\nof names and dates of the previous owners between Steele's _History_ and\r\nthose which actually appear on the cover of the instrument. Steele\r\napparently made the changes he deemed necessary in his account of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nBetween 1791 and 1795 the same address was also occupied by a cooper\r\nnamed Michael Davenport, and from 1797 to 1801 by \"the Widow Davenport,\"\r\npresumably widow of Michael. From 1802 to 1804 the same address is\r\nlisted for William Davenport, \"Mathematical Instrument Maker,\"\r\napprentice to William Dean, and believed to be the son of Michael.\r\nDuring the next ten years Davenport's address was 45 South Front Street,\r\nand then, to 1820, was 25 South Front Street.[64] Several brass\r\nsurveying compasses bearing his name have survived.\r\n\r\nAnother maker of mathematical instruments about whom nothing further is\r\nknown is Charles Taws, who was listed in this manner in the Philadelphia\r\ndirectory of 1795.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--Brass surveying compass marked \"F. Heisely\r\nFred:*town.\" In collection of Ohio Historical Society, Ohio State\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nThe making of instruments in glass appears to have been a specialized\r\nbusiness in the Colonies, because those who worked in this field do not\r\nappear to have produced instruments in other materials. One of these\r\nmakers of glass instruments--specifically barometers, thermometers and\r\n\"Glass Bubbles to prove spirits, of different kinds\"--was Alloysius\r\nKetterer. He maintained a shop in the house of a Charles Kugler at \"the\r\nsign of the Seven Stars,\" corner of Race and Fourth Streets in\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1789. He moved to another address in Race Street in\r\n1790 and was eventually succeeded in business by Martin Fisher, who\r\nincreased the number of types of glass instruments made and sold at the\r\nshop.[65]\r\n\r\nHenry Voight (1738-1814) was a man with a varied career. Of German\r\nancestry, he was trained as a clock-and watchmaker, and he was a skilled\r\nmechanic. He operated a wire mill in Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1780 and\r\nmoved shortly thereafter to Philadelphia, where he established a\r\nclockmaker's shop on Second Street. He became a close friend of the\r\ninventor John Fitch in about 1786, and in the following year he became a\r\nshareholder in Fitch's company for producing steamboats. In 1792 he\r\nentered into a short-lived partnership with Fitch to manufacture steam\r\nengines. In 1793 he invented a process for making steel from bar iron.\r\nIn the same year President Washington appointed Voight to the position\r\nof chief coiner of the Philadelphia Mint, and he continued in that\r\nposition until his death in 1814. He was closely associated with David\r\nRittenhouse, Andrew Ellicott, Edward Duffield, and others.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no record of Voight's career as an instrument maker,\r\nthere is nevertheless some evidence that he worked in that field. In the\r\ncollection of the U.S. National Museum there is a brass equal-altitude\r\ntelescope (fig. 31) made about 1790, that is signed \"Henry Voigt.\" His\r\nname was spelled \"Voigt\" and \"Voight\" interchangeably.\r\n\r\nHenry's son Thomas Voight worked as a clockmaker on North Seventh Street\r\nin Philadelphia around 1811. He was the maker of a tall case clock,\r\nordered by Thomas Jefferson, that Jefferson's daughter presented in 1826\r\nto her father's physician, Dr. Dunglison, for settlement of medical\r\nservices.[66]\r\n\r\nThere were several instrument makers in provincial Pennsylvania, but the\r\nmajority of such craftsmen worked in Philadelphia. Dr. Christopher Witt\r\n(1675-1765), an emigrant from England, worked in Germantown from about\r\n1710 to 1765. He was well known locally as a medical doctor, scientist,\r\n\"hexmeister\", clockmaker, and teacher. It is traditionally claimed that\r\nhe produced mathematical instruments in addition to timepieces. He\r\ndescribed the great comet of 1743 and built his own 8-foot telescope.\r\nOne of his apprentices may have been Christopher Sower (1693-1740), of\r\nGermantown and Philadelphia, who achieved renown as a doctor, farmer,\r\nauthor, printer, papermaker, and clockmaker. He also produced\r\nmathematical instruments.[67]\r\n\r\nGeorge Wall, Jr., of Bucks County, was the author of a pamphlet on the\r\nsubject of \"a newly invented Surveying Instrument, called the\r\nTrigonometer.\" The instrument was described and illustrated in the\r\npamphlet, which was published in Philadelphia in 1788. Washington's own\r\ncopy, bearing the inscription \"To the President of the United States\r\nfrom the Author\" is in the collection of the Boston Athenaeum.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ford of Lancaster maintained a shop on West King Street, probably\r\nfrom the end of the 18th century until 1840. There he made tall case and\r\nother clocks, surveying compasses, and other instruments for the retail\r\ntrade. However, he \"did not push the business of Watchmaking and\r\nClockmaking so hard, for the manufacture of nautical instruments and\r\nsurveyors instruments was a more important part of his business.\"[68]\r\nUpon his death in 1842 he was succeeded by his son George Ford II.\r\n\r\nThomas Mendenhall repaired clocks and mathematical instruments in a shop\r\non King and Queen Streets in the borough of Lancaster in 1775.[69]\r\n\r\nJohn Wood of Philadelphia was a wholesale supplier of parts for\r\nclockmakers and watchmakers. According to a notice in the May 7, 1790,\r\nissue of _Pennsylvania Packet_, he had \"pocket compasses, steel magnets,\r\nSurveying compass needles, surveyors chains, etc.\" Since no mention was\r\nmade of making or mending instruments, it is probable that Wood was\r\nmerely importer and wholesaler.\r\n\r\nAnother instrument maker of Philadelphia about whom little is known is\r\nBryan Gilmur, who worked at the close of the 18th century making\r\ninstruments and, possibly, clocks.[70]\r\n\r\nJames Jacks (also listed as James Jack) first worked as clockmaker and\r\nwatchmaker in Charleston, South Carolina, in the 1780's; he later moved\r\nto Philadelphia where he maintained a shop on Market Street where he\r\nsold a variety of instruments. In the June 5, 1797, issue of _The\r\nFederal Gazette_ he announced that, in addition to jewelry, clocks and\r\nwatches, he \"also had for sale mathematical instruments in cases very\r\ncompleat; Surveyors Compasses and Theodolites; ship's Quadrants; Fishing\r\nRods and Reels; Billiard Balls and sheet ivory; silver and plated coach,\r\nchaise and chair Whips.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31.--Equal altitude telescope, 17 in. long, made\r\nand signed by Henry Voight (1738-1814) of Philadelphia. USNM 311772.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instruments of Wood_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Use of Wood\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact concerning the instruments produced by 18th-century\r\ncraftsmen is the relatively high incidence of instruments constructed of\r\nwood instead of brass or other metals. A significant reference to this\r\nuse of wood is found in Alexander Hamilton's \"Report on the Subject of\r\nManufactures,\" published in 1821,[71] which refers to such items of wood\r\nas \"Ships, cabinet-wares and turnery, wool and cotton cards, and other\r\nmachinery for manufactures and husbandry, mathematical instruments,\" ...\r\nand \"coopers' wares of every kind.\"\r\n\r\nMost common of these mathematical instruments is the surveying compass,\r\npossibly the instrument most needed and produced in America. Recorded in\r\npublic and private collections are 31 known examples of such compasses\r\nmade of wood, a rather large number. Furthermore, a substantial number\r\nof these were being produced simultaneously by skilled craftsmen who at\r\nthe same time were making similar instruments in brass.\r\n\r\nFinally, from a study of the surviving examples of wooden surveying\r\ncompasses comes the interesting and perhaps significant fact that all\r\nthe known makers were from New England. The towns and cities in which\r\nthey worked were Boston and Plymouth in Massachusetts, Windsor and New\r\nMilford in Connecticut, and Walpole and Portsmouth in New Hampshire. A\r\ncareful study of the advertisements and works of the instrument makers\r\nin the other large cities of the Colonies, such as New York, Baltimore,\r\nand Philadelphia, reveals no examples of wooden scientific instruments.\r\nExcluded, of course, are those instruments normally made of wood, such\r\nas the octant and the mariners quadrant.\r\n\r\nTwo possible exceptions are instrument makers of New York City. The\r\nfirst is James Ham, a maker of mathematical instruments \"at the house\r\nwherein the Widow Ratsey lately lived near the Old Dutch Church on\r\nSmith Street\" who advertised in the May 27, 1754, issue of _The New York\r\nMercury_ that he made and sold\r\n\r\n     mathematical instruments in wood, brass, or ivory, theodolites,\r\n     circumferentors, sectors, parallel rules, protractors, plain\r\n     scales, and dividers, the late instrument called an Octant, Davis'\r\n     quadrants, gauging rods, sliding and gunter's scales, amplitude\r\n     wood box and hanging and pocket compasses, surveying chains,\r\n     japanned telescopes, dice and dice boxes, mariners compasses and\r\n     kalenders, etc.[72]\r\n\r\nHam subsequently moved his business to Philadelphia where he first\r\nadvertised in 1764, stating that he worked at the sign of \"Hadley's\r\nQuadrant\" at Front and Water Streets in Philadelphia and sold all forms\r\nof instruments in silver, brass, and ivory as well as \"large brass\r\npocket dials, fitted to the latitude of Philadelphia.\" In 1780 his son\r\nJames Ham, Jr., advertised from the same address as a maker of\r\nmathematical instruments, specializing in \"Hadley and Davis\r\nQuadrants.\"[73]\r\n\r\nThe second exception is William Hinton, who advertised in _The New York\r\nGazette and the Weekly Mercury_ of May 4, 1772, as follows:\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM HINTON, Mathematical Instrument Maker, at Hadley's\r\n     Quadrant, facing the East Side of the New Coffee House, Makes and\r\n     sells all sorts of Mathematical Instruments, in Silver, Brass,\r\n     Ivory or Wood, viz. Hadley's Quadrants, Davis's do. Crostaf's\r\n     Nocturnals, Gunters Scales, Plotting do. Cases of Instruments,\r\n     Surveyors Chains, Dividers with and without Points, Protractors,\r\n     paralelled Rulers, Rods for Guaging, Amplitude, hanging and common\r\n     Wood Compasses, Pocket do. three Foot Telescopes, Pocket do.\r\n     Backgammon Tables, Dice and Dice Boxes, Billiard Balls and Tacks,\r\n     Violin Bows and Bridges; with a Variety of other Articles too\r\n     tedious to mention: And as he is a young Beginner, he flatters\r\n     himself, he shall meet with Encouragement; and all those who please\r\n     to favour him with their Custom, may depend upon having their Work\r\n     done in the neatest and best Manner, and at reasonable Rates.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned that both Ham and Hinton worked in wood in addition to\r\nother materials, but it appears very likely that the use of wood\r\nreferred specifically to those instruments normally made of wood, such\r\nas quadrants and octants, and not to other instruments.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to relate the making of wooden scientific instruments with\r\nthe production of wooden clocks in New England has no conclusive result,\r\nyet there appears to be some relationship between the two. Wooden\r\nclocks were made as early as the 17th century in Germany and Holland,\r\nand they were known in England in the early 18th century. In the\r\nColonies the wooden clock was first produced in Connecticut, and the\r\nearliest type was associated with Hartford County. This form was quite\r\ncommon in East Hartford in 1761, and its first production may have had\r\nsome association with Ebenezer Parmele (1690-1777), since an association\r\nbetween Parmele and all of the earliest makers of wooden clocks can be\r\ntraced.[74] Little is known about Parmele. His father was a cabinetmaker\r\nin Guilford, Connecticut, and Ebenezer practiced the same craft, in\r\naddition to being a boat builder. He was a man of means, held various\r\ntown offices, and served as town treasurer. For a while he operated a\r\ncargo sloop on Long Island Sound. In 1726 he built the first tower clock\r\nin Connecticut for the Guilford meeting house. He was a versatile worker\r\nin wood, and it is believed that he served an apprenticeship in New York\r\nCity with a Dutch clockmaker from 1705 to 1710, where he may have\r\nlearned to make wooden clocks.\r\n\r\nThis early type of wooden clock is associated with Benjamin Cheney\r\n(1725-1815), a clockmaker of East Hartford. The early or \"Cheney\" type\r\nof wooden clock was produced in Connecticut as late as 1812. A later\r\nform of the wooden movement began to appear about 1790, and was probably\r\nintroduced by Gideon Roberts (1749-1813) of Bristol. Roberts had lived\r\nin the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania before 1790, and it is conjectured\r\nthat he became familiar with the wooden clocks produced by the German\r\nsettlers of that region.[75]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the wooden clock had its colonial origins in\r\nConnecticut, so completely was it adaptable to the pioneer conditions in\r\nthat colony. The materials were the abundant native woods-cherry, apple,\r\noak, and laurel. The parts were made with simple carpenter tools and a\r\nwooden foot lathe, using the methods of the cabinetmaker. Although it\r\nhas been suggested that some relationship may have existed between the\r\nmakers of wooden instruments in England, and the makers of wooden clocks\r\nand scientific instruments in the New England Colonies,[76] a careful\r\nstudy has failed to reveal any connection, and there appears to be\r\nlittle if any parallel between the two groups. Basically, the use of\r\nwood for making some mathematical instruments in New England resulted\r\nfrom the native familiarity with this material, which was also employed\r\nto a considerable degree for the construction of domestic and\r\nagricultural implements, and from the fact that many of the early\r\nclockmakers had been trained as or by cabinet makers, carpenters, and\r\neven dish turners. Random examples of a few of the more prominent\r\nclockmakers are Joseph Hopkins, a wood turner; Chauncey Jerome, who had\r\nbeen apprenticed to a wood turner; and Silas Hoadley, who had worked\r\nwith a cabinet maker.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a basis for the prevalence of wood in these trades is to be\r\nfound in the lines from a familiar poem:\r\n\r\n    The Yankee boy, before he's sent to school,\r\n    Knows well the mystery of that magic tool,\r\n    The Pocket knife.[77]\r\n\r\nBut, from the technical point of view, it should be noted that those\r\ncraftsmen who produced clocks and instruments and did not have their own\r\nbrass foundries probably found that a good piece of straight-grained\r\nhardwood was as stable for holding its dimensions with the grain as a\r\npiece of brass. Shrinkage was at right angles to the grain; hence, for\r\nfixed linear stability wood was as good as brass. For rigidity per unit\r\nweight, wood was better than brass; and for availability and ease of\r\nworking, wood was superior to brass.\r\n\r\nIt has often been ventured that wooden clocks were first produced in\r\nConnecticut, because of the scarcity of brass for this purpose during\r\nthe years between the beginning of the Revolution to the end of the War\r\nof 1812. The claim is made that brass was not being produced in the\r\nColonies and that it was imported exclusively from England during this\r\nperiod. Certainly, the wholesale price index of metal and metal products\r\nshows a steady increase during this period, and a considerable jump\r\nduring the period of the War of 1812, making brass an extremely\r\nexpensive material. This may explain why the makers of clocks and\r\ninstruments who made and sold brass clocks and instruments were\r\nproducing the same products at the same time in wood which, as we have\r\nseen, was both plentiful and a satisfactory substitute.\r\n\r\nIt can be surmised, therefore, that surveying instruments, as well as\r\ninstruments for other purposes, were produced in both brass and wood\r\nsimultaneously by many of the New England makers in order to provide\r\nsuitable instruments in a flexible price range to meet the demands of\r\nthe trade. Whereas today modern manufacturing methods make it possible\r\nto produce instruments in a wide variety, both in quality and price, to\r\nsuit the needs and capabilities of every prospective purchaser, the\r\nproduction facilities of the 18th century were much more limited. The\r\nconstant factor of skilled hand labor was costly. Metal was expensive.\r\nAs evidenced in the records of Daniel Burnap, for instance, it was\r\npossible to produce surveying compasses in brass in two grades,\r\npresumably one more elaborate than the other. Yet Burnap's prices ranged\r\nbetween six pounds and four pounds for the metal instruments, making\r\nthem still well out of reach of many of the would-be surveyors.\r\nAccordingly, Burnap--and presumably numerous other instrument makers of\r\nthe period--produced from wood an economy model that sold for not more\r\nthan two pounds, thus placing the item within the reach of the\r\nnonprofessional surveyor.\r\n\r\nThis theory is supported amply by the discovery that several of the\r\ninstrument makers who worked in brass also made instruments of wood\r\nduring the same periods. In addition to the evidence in the records of\r\nDaniel Burnap, there are the surviving surveying instruments in brass\r\nand wood made by Samuel Thaxter, Thomas Greenough, and John Dupee,\r\nleaving little if any doubt that the reason for producing surveying\r\ncompasses and similar items of wood during the 18th century was to\r\nsatisfy the need for reasonably accurate yet inexpensive instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurviving Instruments\r\n\r\nThe fact that the surviving examples of the wooden instruments were\r\nproduced only in New England seems to indicate merely that the New\r\nEngland instrument makers were more familiar with the use of wood as a\r\nmaterial, and had greater facility in working with it.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly other instruments produced by the 18th-century American\r\nmakers have survived in addition to those already found. Quite likely\r\nexamples of these wooden instruments still remain hidden in unexplored\r\nattics and other repositories. Yet, if the few thus far discovered is\r\nany criterion, the number ultimately recoverable will probably be but a\r\nfraction of the great number produced by the 18th-century makers during\r\nthe half century or more in which they worked. Even allowing for those\r\nprobably destroyed in the natural course of events, one cannot help but\r\nwonder what has happened to the remainder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32.--Wooden graphometer used by Rev. Eleazar\r\nWheelock (1711-1779) about 1769 for surveying the area of Dartmouth\r\nCollege in Hanover, New Hampshire. The hardwood block is covered with a\r\nbrass plate with brass sighting bars mounted on a swivel and a spirit\r\nlevel under a brass strip on edge of instrument. The instrument is 8-5/8\r\nin. long, 4-5/8 in. wide, and 7/16 in. thick. In collection of Dartmouth\r\nCollege Museum.]\r\n\r\nA list of the surviving wooden instruments is given in the Appendix (p.\r\n153). Many of these wooden instruments bear signatures or other marks\r\nthat permit identification of their makers, but a number of specimens\r\nhave been found that are not signed. In most instances they show\r\nevidence of professional workmanship, and they may have been the work of\r\nknown craftsmen. One or two examples are obviously homemade by unskilled\r\namateur practitioners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33.--Wooden surveying instrument, maker not known.\r\nCompass dial is of metal, painted green, with degrees marked to 90 deg. with\r\nmetal punches and the letter \"N\" to designate the north point. The\r\ninstrument is 12 in. long; diameter is 8 in. In collection of Dartmouth\r\nCollege Museum.]\r\n\r\nSeveral unsigned wooden instruments of professional quality are in the\r\ncollection of the Dartmouth College Museum. Of particular interest is a\r\nsemicircumferentor (fig. 32) that belonged to the Reverend Eleazar\r\nWheelock (1711-1779) who founded Moor's Indian Charity School at\r\nLebanon, Connecticut, which subsequently developed into Dartmouth\r\nCollege. It is claimed that it was with this instrument that the area of\r\nthe college was surveyed when it moved to Hanover, N.H. The instrument\r\nis actually a graphometer consisting of a block of hard wood faced with\r\na brass plate with a trough compass; it is tentatively dated about 1769.\r\nThe identity of the maker is unknown, but it may have been the product\r\nof Hagger, who made a similar instrument, illustrated here, or it may\r\nhave been produced by any one of the other makers noted. The type of\r\ninstrument is an old one. It is described in John Love's _Geodaesia, Or\r\nthe Art of Surveying and Measuring Land_, published in London in 1688.\r\nAbel Flint[78] also commented on this semicircle as being sometime used,\r\nas well as the plane table and perambulator--\r\n\r\n     ... but of these instruments very little [use] is made in New\r\n     England; and they are not often to be met with. For general\r\n     practice none will be found more useful than a common chain and a\r\n     compass upon Rittenhouse's construction.\r\n\r\nAnother of the unusual wooden surveying instruments in the collection of\r\nthe Dartmouth College Museum is a wooden surveying compass (fig. 33) in\r\nwhich the sighting bars appear relatively close to the dial. A metal\r\nplate, painted green, is stamped with the degrees marked to 90 deg.. A\r\nsingle N for the north point is stamped into it, presumably with steel\r\npunches. The instrument is relatively primitive, and is sufficiently\r\ndifferent from the other examples noted to merit mention. There is no\r\nmaker's name, nor any clue to the date or place or period of origin.\r\n\r\nAn unsigned semicircumferentor made of wood is owned by Mr. Roleigh Lee\r\nStubbs of Charleston, West Virginia. The instrument measures 3-3/4 in.\r\nby 7-1/2 in. by 1 in., and there are sighting bars 3 in. high on a\r\nswinging brass bar pinned at the center of the base. It has a trough\r\ncompass, and the gradations around the edge of the semicircle are marked\r\nwith tiny brass pins. The date \"1784\" is stamped into the wood with the\r\nsame type of figures as appear in the degree markings, probably with\r\nsmall steel punches.\r\n\r\nA surveying compass of the conventional type, also made of wood, is in\r\nThe Farmer's Museum at Cooperstown, New York. The wood is ash or oak,\r\n12-3/4 in. long and 6-1/2 in. in diameter, with the sighting bars 5 in.\r\nhigh. The compass card consists of cut-out printed letters pasted upon a\r\nprinted compass rose, and the fleur-de-lis at North is inked-in by hand.\r\nThis may be a homemade replacement of the original card. The instrument\r\nis believed to date between 1760-1775.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34.--18th-century semicircumferentor. Inscribed\r\nbrass plate is mounted on a mahogany block; brass sighting bars are\r\nmounted on a swivelling bar. The trough compass is on a silvered dial.\r\nIn collection of the writer.]\r\n\r\nOf equal interest is a large semicircumferentor made by an unknown\r\nAmerican instrument maker in the second half of the 18th century. The\r\ninstrument (fig. 34) consists of a plate of hammered brass attached to a\r\nquarter circle block of mahogany, with a glass covered trough compass\r\nwithin a silvered opening, and the gradations stamped into the brass.\r\nThe brass sighting bars are attached to a swivelling bar that can be\r\nfixed in place with a set screw underneath the block. The instrument,\r\nwhich is in the collection of the writer, is not signed with a maker's\r\nname. Its workmanship is excellent, and professional.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of a comparison of these instruments with those produced by\r\nknown professional makers, it becomes apparent that all of them were\r\nmade professionally. The possibility that some of these wooden surveying\r\ncompasses may have been produced by the farmer or local surveyor for his\r\nown use is extremely unlikely. Homemade instruments such as those\r\ndescribed below were unquestionably the exception instead of the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 35.--Homemade wooden surveying compass carved from\r\nblock of maple entirely with a jackknife; painted in red. In collection\r\nof Preston R. Bassett, Ridgefield, Connecticut.]\r\n\r\nAn exception to this generalization, and an extremely fine example of\r\nthe whittler's art, is a surveying compass (fig. 35) in the collection\r\nof Mr. Preston R. Bassett of Ridgefield, Connecticut. This is a\r\ncomparatively small instrument made of maple; the body was painted red.\r\nIt is carved entirely by means of a jackknife, and the sighting bars are\r\nalso whittled to shape and mortised permanently into the frame. A lid\r\ncovering the dial is carved from soft pine. The compass dial is\r\nhanddrawn in black ink, and the North point is painted in the form of a\r\ndecorative fleur-de-lis in red and green. A homemade ring of pewter\r\nsurrounds the compass rose at needle level. This is graduated in\r\ndegrees, with every 10 deg. marked, stamped with steel punches. The ring is\r\nset into the base by means of wooden pegs. The steel needle is nicely\r\ncut, and it is probably the only part purchased by the maker.\r\n\r\nThis is unquestionably a homemade instrument produced by a skillful\r\nwhittler early in the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompass Cards\r\n\r\nA fact that becomes apparent in a comparison of the surviving examples\r\nof wooden surveying compasses made in New England is the similarity of\r\nthe compass cards used by makers in the seaport cities (see fig. 36).\r\nThe compass card in each of these instances is the type designed for a\r\nmariner's compass, bearing a star of 32 rays to mark the 32 points of\r\nthe heavens. The North point is designated with an elaborate\r\nfleur-de-lis, and the East is emphasized with scrollwork. These are\r\nfeatures which were not designed primarily for land surveying.\r\nPresumably, these makers had a quantity of engraved or printed compass\r\ncards that they used in both marine and land surveying compasses. This\r\nis true in the case of the compasses made by James and Joseph Halsy,\r\nGreenough, Clough, Warren, Thaxter, Dupee, Breed, and Bowles. On the\r\nother hand, the dial of Huntington's compass was painted directly on the\r\nwood, and the semicircumferentors do not utilize the marine compass\r\ncard. Obviously these makers resorted to this practice for reasons of\r\neconomy--to reduce costs of engraving and printing, and using the same\r\ncard for both types of instruments that they produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade Signs\r\n\r\nAn interesting sidelight in the study of the makers of scientific\r\ninstruments is the advertising they used, particularly the design of\r\ntheir signboards. The most popular symbol appears to have been the\r\nquadrant, as the phrase \"At the Sign of the Quadrant\" is found\r\nrepeatedly in advertising in several of the seaport cities of the 18th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 36.--Unsigned wooden surveying compass, with an\r\ninteresting example of a mariner's compass card.]\r\n\r\nIn Providence, William Hamlin used the designation in the first part of\r\nthe 19th century, while Philadelphian John Gould featured the sign at\r\nthe end of the 18th century. During an even earlier period, William\r\nHinton designated his address to be \"At Hadley's Quadrant\" in New York\r\nCity. Both Gould and Hinton were English, which may have had some\r\nbearing on their selection of the quadrant as a symbol of their\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nOther signboards were as colorful, such as Jonathan Dakin's \"Sign of the\r\nHand and Beam,\" James Youle's \"Sign of the Cross-Knives and Gun,\" and\r\nCharles Kugler's house in Philadelphia with its \"Sign of the Seven\r\nStars\" (that is, Great Bear), which housed the shops of several\r\ninstrument makers.\r\n\r\nThe two most interesting and significant of the instrument makers' trade\r\nsigns were those advertising the shop of Samuel Thaxter. The first of\r\nthese was the carved wooden figure of \"The Little Admiral,\" which was a\r\nfavorite landmark at No. 1 Long Wharf in Boston for almost a century and\r\na half. It was the handiwork of John Skillin, the 18th-century\r\nwoodcarver of Boston, upon whose death on January 24, 1800, the\r\n_Chronicle_ commented that \"he was for many years the most eminent of\r\nhis profession.\" John Skillin and his brother Simeon worked in Boston\r\nfrom about 1777 and produced most of the figureheads that issued from\r\nthat port during that period, as well as a number of other notable\r\nornamental wooden figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 37.--\"The Little Admiral,\" trade sign used for\r\nalmost a century and a half in Boston, first by William Williams and\r\nlater by Samuel Thaxter. Reputed to have been carved by John Skillin of\r\nBoston. In collection of the Bostonian Society.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mrs. H. Ropes Cabot of the Bostonian Society, the figure of\r\n\"The Little Admiral\" (fig. 37) had been carved for William Williams, who\r\nbrought it with him to Boston from Marblehead in 1770 when he\r\nestablished his shop. The figure was installed in front of the Crown\r\nCoffee House, and Williams's shop was thereafter designated by this\r\nsymbol. The trade sign survived through the years of the Revolutionary\r\nWar. When the original building of the Coffee House was burned, the\r\ncarving was saved and installed on the new building erected in its\r\nplace. In an account of Boston landmarks, Porter[79] related the figure\r\nto the Admiral Vernon Tavern at the eastern corner of Merchants Row. He\r\nwas proved to have been in error, however, since the trade sign of that\r\npublic-house was a portrait bust of Admiral Vernon and the place was\r\nknown as the Vernon Head Tavern for half a century, even after the end\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWhen Samuel Thaxter purchased the business from Williams's estate he\r\nacquired the figure as well, and he moved it to each new location for\r\nhis shop. The figure of \"The Little Admiral\" continued to designate the\r\nfirm even after Thaxter's death, until the firm finally went out of\r\nexistence at the beginning of the 20th century. When the old store was\r\ntorn down in 1901, the figure was preserved, presumably by the last\r\nowner's family. In 1916 it was acquired for the Bostonian Society by\r\nseveral of its members, and the figure has been preserved in the\r\nSociety's Council Chamber since that time.\r\n\r\nThe other interesting trade sign utilized by Samuel Thaxter is a carved\r\nfigure of Father Time that is credited to John Skillin (see fig. 38).\r\nThe figure is believed to have been commissioned by Thaxter during the\r\nlast decade of the 18th century and installed by him in the interior of\r\nhis shop. It is an important example of the American woodcarver's art,\r\nand is equivalent to the best work of the Skillin brothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 38.--\"Father Time\" trade sign used by Samuel\r\nThaxter in his shop in 18th and 19th centuries. Made of wood, it was\r\ncarved by John Skillin of Boston. In collection of the Bostonian\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Makers\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the names of the craftsmen who produced wooden instruments\r\nare not noted among the instrument makers. With only one or two\r\nexceptions, their names are hitherto unknown in the history of American\r\nscience, and for that reason it has been considered advisable to present\r\nall available information that could be accumulated about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Halsy_\r\n\r\nThe earliest known maker of wooden scientific instruments of Boston was\r\nJoseph Halsy. He appears to have been one of the sons of the James\r\nHalsie I, who was mentioned in a land deed of 1674 as a mathematician.[80]\r\nThe land records indicate that James I was the father of several\r\nchildren, including Rebecca, a spinster; John Halsey, a mariner who died\r\nbefore 1716; Sarah, who later became Mrs. Dorsan; another daughter, name\r\nunknown, who became the wife of a Joseph Gilbert and the mother of two\r\ndaughters and a son who inherited her share of her father's estate;\r\nNathaniel Halsie; and probably Joseph Halsy. James Halsie I appears to\r\nhave owned property consisting of land, a wooden house, and wharves on\r\nthe North End, on North Street between Sun Court and Fleet Street.[81]\r\n\r\nThe date of birth of Joseph Halsy of Boston has not been found, but\r\nmention is made of the fact that on January 29, 1697, he was married to\r\nElizabeth Eldridge, the daughter of a mariner named Joseph Eldridge, and\r\nthat five children resulted from the marriage, three sons and two\r\ndaughters.[82] One son, Joseph, died in infancy and a daughter,\r\nElizabeth, died at an early age.\r\n\r\nOn February 26, 1704/5 Halsy purchased from Rebecca Halsey, the spinster\r\ndaughter of James, her share in the house and land of her late father on\r\nNorth Street between Sun Court and Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nOn April 19, 1714, Halsy and his wife deeded a house and land on North\r\nEnd, at the corner of Hanover and Salutation Streets, to a shipwright\r\nnamed Joseph Hood. Two years later, on March 2, 1716, he purchased from\r\nJane, his sister-in-law, who was the widow of the mariner John Halsy,\r\nher share of the house and land of James Halsie, being the same property\r\non North Street. On March 27 of the same year he purchased the share in\r\nthe same property belonging to Sarah Dorsan, his widowed sister. In\r\nAugust 1719 he was forced to mortgage some of the property to a merchant\r\nnamed John Frizell, but the mortgage was cancelled in 1741.\r\n\r\nHalsy was married for a second time on January 10, 1731, to Mrs. Anna\r\nLloyd, a widow.[83]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 39.--Wooden surveying compass \"Made and sold by\r\nJoseph Halsy, Boston, New England.\" The instrument, made of maple, is 11\r\nin. long and has a diameter of 5-3/4 in. In the collection of New\r\nHampshire Historical Society, Concord.]\r\n\r\nDuring the 1730's, Halsy continued to buy out the heirs of James Halsie.\r\nOn March 6, 1730, he acquired the share of Mary Gilbert, a\r\ngranddaughter, and on the same date he purchased from the James Halsey\r\nheirs their inheritance \"part to land, wharf, house, shop and buildings\r\non North Street.\" Other heirs remained, for in June 9, 1732, he bought\r\nout the share of Marty Partridge, another granddaughter, and on June 27\r\nthe share of Joseph Gilbert, Jr., a grandson. In October 1740 he was\r\nforced to mortgage as security to James Bowdoin a house and land on the\r\nsouthwest side of North Street, but this was cancelled when on August\r\n26, 1751, Joseph Halsey and his wife, Anna, deeded to James Noble the\r\nland, wooden house, and wharves near Fish Street on North Street between\r\nSun Court and Fleet Street, which apparently was formerly the property\r\nof James Halsey that Joseph had acquired with so much trouble over a\r\nperiod of 40 years.[84]\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement relating to instruments sold by Halsy\r\nappeared in the issues of _The Boston Gazette_ for the months of\r\nSeptember and October 1738:\r\n\r\n     Made and sold by Joseph Halsey jun. Hadley's New Invented Quadrant\r\n     or Octant the best and exacted Instrument for taking the Latitude\r\n     or Other Altitudes at Sea, as ever yet Invented.[85]\r\n\r\nThe last dated record relating to Joseph Halsy which has been found is a\r\nletter dated February 3, 1762, that he wrote to Robert Treat Paine\r\nconcerning legal matters.\r\n\r\nOnly one complete instrument produced by Joseph Halsy appears to have\r\nsurvived--an especially fine wooden surveyors compass (fig. 39) in the\r\ncollection of the New Hampshire Historical Society. It is made of maple.\r\nThe compass card, probably the most interesting of any found in the\r\nwooden instruments, is hand-colored in black, blue, red, and gold. A\r\nfleur-de-lis marks the North point, and triangular pointers indicate the\r\nother compass directions. Inside the pointers are crudely painted female\r\nfigures representing the seven arts: NW, Grammar; W, Logick; SW,\r\nGeometry; S, Arithmetick; SE, Astronomy; E, Rhetorick; and NE, Musick.\r\nWithin a medallion at the center of the compass card is depicted a\r\nsailing vessel at sea; surrounding the medallion is a riband inscribed\r\n\"Made and Sold by JOSEPH HALSY Boston--New England.\"[86]\r\n\r\nAnother, but much less elaborate, compass card used by Joseph Halsy, is\r\nan engraved example (fig. 40) found glued in Thomas Paine's own\r\nmanuscript copy of Charles Morton's _Compendium Physicae_, which is\r\npreserved in the collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society.\r\n\r\nJohn Halsy (fl. 1700-1750), also a mathematical instrument maker, had a\r\nshop on Green Street, in Boston, according to the Record Commissioner's\r\n\"Report of the City of Boston.\" He was married on December 10, 1700, by\r\nthe Reverend Cotton Mather. He probably was a brother of Joseph Halsy\r\nwho worked in the same period.\r\n\r\nJohn Halsy subsequently abandoned his instrument-making business to\r\nbecome a pirate. He went out to Madagascar, where it is reported that he\r\ndied in his own bed. He was buried with the rites of the Church of\r\nEngland in his own watermelon patch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 40.--Compass card of Joseph Halsy found glued into\r\nThomas Paine's personal copy of Charles Morton's _Compendium Physicae_.\r\nIn collection of Massachusetts Historical Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_James Halsy II_\r\n\r\nJames Halsy II (1695-1767), a mathematical instrument maker, was born in\r\nBoston on April 10, 1695, the son of Nathaniel and Hannah (Gross)\r\nHalsie. The parents had been married by the Reverend Cotton Mather in\r\nJune 1693.[87] In 1716 young James Halsy was a member of the Artillery\r\nCompany, and by 1720 he had the rating of 4th sergeant. He held town\r\noffices and was one of the founders of the New Brick Church of Boston.\r\nOn May 30, 1717, he married Anna Gutridge (Goodrich). Ten years later,\r\non September 22, 1727, he bought a house and land on North Bennett and\r\nTileston Streets from Hugh Hall, a merchant; at the same time he deeded\r\nto Hall some land and a house adjacent to the latter on the southwest\r\nside of Green Street. On January 5, 1837, he deeded to his aunt(?), a\r\nsingle woman named Huldah Gross, a house and land on Ann Street that he\r\nhad inherited from Thomas Gross, his grandfather. Several more real\r\nestate negotiations were recorded in the course of the next few years.\r\nIn October 1740 he purchased a house and land on the north side of North\r\nBennet Street from John Endicott; in January 1741 land on the east side\r\nof North Bennett Street; and in November 1748 half of the house and land\r\nof Edward Pell, adjacent to Huldah Gross, on Cross Street; finally, in\r\nOctober 1753, he purchased land on Tileston and North Bennett Streets\r\nfrom John Grant.[88]\r\n\r\nHalsy died on January 2, 1767, at the age of 72. In his will dated May\r\n1, 1766, and probated January 2, 1767, by which his wife Anna was the\r\nexecutrix of his estate, he left her the income of his real and personal\r\nestate. He apparently was survived by three daughters and a son, also\r\nnamed James Halsy. He divided his real estate in Boston amongst his\r\ndaughters, and to his son he left land in New Hampshire.[89]\r\n\r\nThe only known surviving instrument bearing James Halsy's name is a\r\nwooden surveying compass (fig. 41) in the collection of the Peabody\r\nMuseum in Salem. The engraved compass card is quite similar to the one\r\nused by Thomas Greenough. In the central medallion is an elaborate royal\r\ncrown, and in the circle around the medallion is inscribed \"Made and\r\nSold by JAMES HALSY near Ye Draw Bridge in Boston.\"[90]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 41.--Wooden surveying compass made by James Halsy\r\n(1695-1767) of Boston. The instrument is 11 in. long. In collection of\r\nEast India Marine Hall, Peabody Museum, Salem, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Greenough_\r\n\r\nContemporary with James Halsy II was Thomas Greenough (1710-1785), who\r\nwas born in Boston in 1710, the son of John and Elizabeth (Gross)\r\nGreenough. His father was a shipwright in the North End of Boston, and\r\none of Thomas's brothers, Newman Greenough, became a sailmaker. Thomas\r\nalso had a sister named Jerusha, who later figured in his real estate\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known record relating to Greenough is of his marriage in\r\n1734 to Martha Clarke, daughter of William and Sarah Clarke of Boston.\r\nNine children resulted from this marriage over the course of the next 16\r\nyears; four of these were sons. On January 27 of the year of his\r\nmarriage he purchased a house on the northwest side of North Street,\r\nbetween Mill Creek and Union Street, from John White and Nathaniel\r\nRoberts. On August 1, 1736, Greenough purchased the house and land of\r\nhis father-in-law, William Clarke, on the south side of Portland Street.\r\nOn October 28 he mortgaged to his mother his house on Ann Street (which\r\nappears to have been the house he had purchased on North Street), and at\r\nthe same time he deeded to his brother Newman all his right and title in\r\nhis father's estate at the North End. Greenough was only 24 at the time\r\nof his marriage, and he apparently became involved in real estate, by\r\nchoice or by necessity, to a considerable degree.\r\n\r\nGreenough, in 1744, was a member of a militia company in Boston,[91] and\r\nthree years later, in 1747, he was listed as third sergeant. He was a\r\nfirm patriot, held a town office, and was a founder and deacon of the\r\nNew Brick Church in Boston.\r\n\r\nGreenough had a substantial interest in the holdings of his late\r\nfather-in-law. For example, on August 11, 1744, he and his wife deeded\r\nto a merchant named James Pitts the seawall, or new wharf, \"before the\r\nTown of Boston in the front and rear lying to the northward of King\r\nStreet Pier, North Wharf and flats of James Bowdoin,\" all of which was\r\npart of the estate of his deceased father-in-law that apparently had\r\nbeen inherited by his wife. In the following year, on November 1, 1745,\r\nhe purchased a house and land on Portland Street from his widowed\r\nmother-in-law and then on March 31, 1746, he and his wife deeded the\r\nsame house and land to a merchant named Stephen Hall. Numerous other\r\nnegotiations of the same nature are on record.\r\n\r\nAt some time between 1748 and 1750 Greenough's first wife, Martha, died,\r\nand in 1750 he married Sarah Stoddard. Three more children, all sons,\r\nresulted from this second marriage. His real estate negotiations\r\ncontinued full pace during the second marriage as during the first.[92]\r\n\r\nGreenough's second wife preceded him in death, and Greenough died in\r\n1785 at the age of 75. His will, probated on August 23, 1785, had been\r\nmade on May 21, 1782;[93] it contained some interesting bequests:\r\n\r\n     Executors: my two sons, David S. and William Greenough. Legatees:\r\n     to the children of my son Thomas, deceased, Rachel, Ann, and Sally\r\n     Greenough, L13.6.8 each. To their sister Betty L5. To the children\r\n     of my son John deceased, 200 acres of land. I also give his eldest\r\n     son John my silver can, fellow to the one I gave his father. To his\r\n     sons Wm. and David, and to his daughters, Sarah, Abigail, and\r\n     Mehitible L5 each and the house they live in. My daughter, Sarah\r\n     Edwards, L10 and a silver chafing dish. My daughter Martha Stone\r\n     all my lands in the County of York, Cape Porpoise, and Wells, and\r\n     my silver salver, and her son Thomas L5 and a silver porringer. My\r\n     daughter Elizabeth Brooks L10 and a silver tea pot. My daughter\r\n     Mary Savage L40 and to her son Thomas one silver porringer. To the\r\n     children of my daughter Jerusha, deceased, Martha Clark Lepear and\r\n     Sally Lepear each of them, L50, and a pair of salt shovels, and a\r\n     pepper box, silver. All the rest of my estate to my two sons, David\r\n     Stoddard Greenough, and Wm. Greenough. The late Shute Shrimpton\r\n     Yeoman, Esq., left an estate to my late spouse Sarah, and to her\r\n     children, in the Island of Antigua. In case my son David should\r\n     have a legal possession of same, and Wm. no part, in that case I\r\n     give my son David L100 and sundry pieces as per schedule amount to\r\n     L63.11.3. All the rest of my estate to my son, William Greenough.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest with relation to Greenough's business in\r\ninstruments is the following advertisement that appeared on May 11,\r\n1742, in _The Boston Gazette_:\r\n\r\n     To be sold by Capt. Cyprian Southack at his House near the Orange\r\n     Tree and at Mr. Tho. Greenough's Mathematical Instrument Maker near\r\n     the Draw Bridge, said Southack's Char[t]s of the Coast from Sandy\r\n     Point of New York to Canso.\r\n\r\nInvaluable for this study are Thomas Greenough's manuscript accounts\r\nthat have survived in the collections of the Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety. The following itemized entries are selected from Greenough's\r\nbusiness accounts over a period of two decades to provide data on the\r\nprices current in the second half of the 18th century for new\r\ninstruments and for repairing others:\r\n\r\n      In Account with Thomas James Gruchy:\r\n          1754, April 27: 1 Compass for the Schooner _Sea Flour_  L0.8.0.\r\n          1758, Nov. 28:  1 Spyglass                             L1.13.8.\r\n          1759, Jan. 25:  Mending 3 Compasses for the Schooner\r\n                            _Susanna_                             L0.6.0.\r\n\r\n      In Account with Nathaniel Bethune:\r\n          1760, August: A gauging rod                             L0.6.0.\r\n                    Mending a telescope                           L0.3.0.\r\n\r\n      In Account with Captain McAndrew Mirick of Nantucket:\r\n           1772, March 21: For 2 compasses, 1 leaded             L0.16.8.\r\n\r\n      In Account with Captain Roberson Crockett:\r\n          1773, April: For mending 2 Compasses                    L0.6.2.\r\n                       For mending 1 Hanging Compass              L0.3.2.\r\n\r\n      In Account with Captain Reworth of the Brig _Fortune_:\r\n          1774, March 30: For mending 2 compasses & Glasses       L0.7.0.\r\n\r\n      In Account with Captain Thomas Godfrey:\r\n          1774, April 7: For 1 Telescope                          L0.8.0.\r\n\r\nOther documents in the same collection indicate that Greenough's\r\nbusiness interests were substantial and not limited merely to the\r\nconstruction of instruments. On July 31, 1769, Greenough's name appeared\r\non the Boston Citizens' Non-Importation Agreement. Subsequently, on\r\nDecember 14, 1774, there is Greenough's signed receipt, with the amount\r\nleft blank, stating that he had \"REC'D. of Capt. Thomas Godfrey the Sum\r\nof ---- in full for my Negro man Cuffes Shair in the Whaling Voige\r\n----.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 42.--Brass surveying compass made by Thomas\r\nGreenough (1710-1785) of Boston.

Photo courtesy of Dr. Thomas Greenough.]\r\n\r\nGreenough apparently was succeeded in business by his son William\r\nGreenough. Mr. Lawrence B. Romaine of Middleboro, Massachusetts, in 1939\r\ndescribed a wooden surveying compass with its own hand-whittled tripod\r\nmade of oak which bore a compass card inscribed \"Made by William\r\nGreenough, Boston, N.E.\"[94] The compass was protected by a pine cover\r\nthat fitted closely between the sights. The present location of this\r\ninstrument is not known, but it appears to be the only known example by\r\nWilliam Greenough made of wood.[95]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 43.--Wooden surveying compass, made and sold by\r\nThomas Greenough. The instrument is made of gumwood and has a paper\r\ncompass card; it is 13-1/4 in. long and has a diameter of 5-3/4 in. In\r\ncollection of Franklin Institute, Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\nIn the Greenough family at the present time is a brass surveying compass\r\n(fig. 42) of fine quality and of the period before or during the\r\nAmerican Revolution. The dial is finely engraved with a Tudor rose at\r\nits center, and around it is the inscription \"THOMAS GREENOUGH BOSTON\r\nFecit.\" The compass face is mounted to the main blade with two copper\r\nrivets. The holding screws for the vane and tripod mounting are rather\r\ncrudely hand cut with wing-nut ends.[96]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 44.--Wooden surveying compass made and sold by\r\nThomas Greenough. Made of hickory, it is 11 in. long and has a diameter\r\nof 5-1/2 in. Compass card is of paper. Allegedly, this compass was used\r\nby Joseph Frye for surveying his land grant in what is now Fryeburg,\r\nMaine, in 1762. Loaned to the U.S. National Museum by Laurits C. Eichner\r\nof Clifton, New Jersey. USNM 315001.]\r\n\r\nFive other surveying compasses made by Thomas Greenough are known, and\r\nall are made of wood: the one in the Franklin Institute is made of gum\r\n(fig. 43), one in Old Sturbridge is made of maple, one in the Bucks\r\nCounty Historical collection at the Mercer Museum is made of cherry, one\r\nowned by this writer is made of basswood, and one on loan to the U.S.\r\nNational Museum from Mr. Laurits C. Eichner is made of hickory (fig.\r\n44).\r\n\r\nThe compass at the Mercer Museum forms part of the surveyor's gear used\r\nto lay out the town of Weymouth, Massachusetts. The example in hickory\r\non loan to the U.S. National Museum, as is usually the case with the\r\ncompass cards of the Thomas Greenough instruments, has the central ring\r\nprinted in gilt, and the inscription has turned black, making the\r\ninscription almost illegible. This specimen was owned by Joseph Frye,\r\nwho was given a land grant in what is now Fryeburg, Maine, in 1762. He\r\nallegedly used this compass for surveying that land. In 1783 he\r\nassembled a manuscript book of tables (see fig. 45) for use in\r\nsurveying for his son Joseph Frye, Jr. This manuscript also is part of\r\nthe loan to the U.S. National Museum.[97]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 45.--Pages from a booklet of \"Tables Useful in\r\nSurveying Land, Made and presented by Joseph Frye to his son, Joseph\r\nFrye, Jr., November 18, A.D. 1783.\" Loaned to the U.S. National Museum\r\nby Laurits C. Eichner of Clifton, N.J. USNM 315062.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 46.--Compass card from a wooden surveying compass\r\n\"Made by Thomas Greenough, Boston, New England.\" In collection of the\r\nwriter.]\r\n\r\nThe compass card in each of these five instruments is identical,\r\ndesigned for use in the mariner's compass (see fig. 46). A gentleman in\r\nthe dress of about 1740 stands on the shore using a Davis quadrant.\r\nOffshore in the harbor is a schooner of the 1750 period. Minor features\r\nof the scene are touched up in red, presumably printed, since they are\r\nconsistent in all of the cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Williams_\r\n\r\nAlthough not one of the earliest instrument makers in Boston, but\r\ncertainly one of the more significant, was William Williams\r\n(1737/8-1792). He was the son of Capt. John Williams, a shopkeeper who\r\ndied on March 22, 1748, at the age of 41, and who was buried in King's\r\nChapel Burial Ground.[98]\r\n\r\nWilliam Williams was born in 1737 or 1738. He was ten years of age when\r\nhis father died, and he had two brothers and two sisters. His father\r\nleft a substantial estate of L6,575, of which L4,544/9/4 was for the\r\ninventory of the shop merchandise. One of the appraisers for his estate,\r\nJotham Maverick, married the widowed Mrs. Williams less than a year\r\nlater, on January 20, 1748/9.[99]\r\n\r\nIn 1770 William Williams established himself as a mathematical\r\ninstrument maker and clockmaker at No. 1 Long Wharf, at the Crown Coffee\r\nHouse, as it was then known. The shop was located on the corner of State\r\nand Chatham Streets, on premises owned by Robert Shillcock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 47.--Quadrant, showing signature of Thomas\r\nGreenough. Photo courtesy Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford.]\r\n\r\nWilliams may have worked as an instrument maker in Marblehead before\r\nreturning to his native Boston. According to Felt,[100] an instrument\r\nmaker named William Williams at Marblehead advertised in the Salem\r\nnewspapers in the early 1770's. However, in 1768 Williams was producing\r\ninstruments from an address in King Street, Boston. (See figure 48.) An\r\nadvertisement inserted by Williams appeared in the March 12, 1770, issue\r\nof _The Boston Gazette_. It was this same issue that reported the Boston\r\nMassacre. One of the victims was Williams' step-brother Samuel Maverick,\r\nthe son of his stepfather Jotham Maverick by a first marriage.\r\n\r\nIn 1773 Williams married Joyce Shillcock, the daughter of his landlord.\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Williams saw active service as a private\r\nin Captain Mills' company, of Col. Jeduthan Baldwin's regiment of\r\nartificers, during the years 1777-1779. In 1780 he served in Captain\r\nPattin's company of General Knox's artillery, which was stationed at\r\nWest Point.[101]\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the war Williams returned to the craft of\r\ninstrument-making in his shop, at No. 1 Long Wharf. In 1782 his wife,\r\nJoyce, inherited the property from her mother, the widow Hannah\r\nShillcock, following the latter's death in that year. In the following\r\nMay it is recorded that Williams purchased the warehouse and land on the\r\nnorth side of State Street from Benjamin Brown, a trader. By a separate\r\ndeed, he and his wife released to Brown the warehouse and land which had\r\nbeen the property of his father-in-law in exchange for a clear title to\r\none-half share of the store and land under it \"which is next to the\r\nstreet called King Street.\" On February 7, 1784, he bought a share of\r\nthe lower division at Long Wharf, No. 7, from Arnold Welles. On May 17\r\nof the same year he succeeded in buying out Brown's half share of the\r\nlower division of Long Wharf at Nos. 1 and 7, and at the same time he\r\ndeeded to Brown one-half share of No. 7 Long Wharf, together with all\r\nits dockage and wharfage. Finally, on January 20, 1785, Williams and his\r\nwife deeded to Brown all rights to land of No. 7 Long Wharf, reserving\r\nfor himself his rights in the flats, wharfage, and dockage.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 1787, Williams deeded to Joseph Helyer, a blockmaker, the\r\nstore and land under same, and half the wharfage properly belonging to\r\nLot No. 1. On October 20 of the same year he sold to Brown a part or\r\nshare of No. 7 Long Wharf, and on March 24, 1788, he purchased land with\r\na wooden store at State Street and Long Wharf from Benjamin Brown. On\r\nJune 26 he bought the land and store of Joseph Helyer on the north side\r\nof Long Wharf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 48.--Advertisement of William Williams in _The\r\nBoston Gazette_, March 12, 1770. Photo courtesy Harvard University\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\nWilliams engaged in only two more transactions before his death. On\r\nMarch 28, 1790, he mortgaged to Joseph Greene, a merchant, the land with\r\nwooden store at the head of Long Wharf on the northeast side of State\r\nStreet; this mortgage was cancelled on May 29, 1793. On October 1, 1791,\r\nhe deeded to Benjamin Brown a one-half share or 1/48th of all the\r\ndockage and wharfage of Long Wharf that appertained to one-half of Lot\r\nNo. 1, which he had previously purchased from Welles as noted, as well\r\nas 1/48th of the proprietor's purchase of Gordon's lands and buildings\r\nadjoining the Wharf.\r\n\r\nWilliams died on January 15, 1792, at age 44. The administrator of his\r\nestate was a merchant named Abraham Quincy. By order of the Supreme\r\nCourt, in order to settle his estate, Williams' store building at No. 1\r\nLong Wharf was ordered sold at public auction. Although on the site of\r\nthe Crown Coffee House, it was a new building erected in 1780 after the\r\nCoffee House had burned. The purchaser appears to have been John Osborn,\r\na merchant, because on May 10, 1793, Quincy, Williams' administrator,\r\ndeeded to Osborn the land with wooden store at Long Wharf on State\r\nStreet.[102]\r\n\r\nThe only instrument made by Williams which appears to have survived is a\r\nDavis backstaff (fig. 49) marked \"By Wm. Williams, King Street, Boston,\r\nfor Malachi Allen, 1768\"; this instrument is now in the collection of\r\nthe Peabody Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. It is to be noted from this\r\ninscription that this instrument was an early example of Williams' work,\r\nproduced at the age of 20, prior to the opening of his shop at the Crown\r\nCoffee House.\r\n\r\nIn 1770, when Williams opened his shop, the carved sign of \"The Little\r\nAdmiral\" (fig. 37) was installed in front of the Crown Coffee House, and\r\nWilliams' establishment was thereafter designated by this symbol.[103]\r\n\r\nIn his shop at No. 1 Long Wharf, Williams exercised his crafts of\r\ninstrument-and clockmaking, and he made and sold a large assortment of\r\ninstruments, as well as time glasses which measured from one quarter\r\nminute to two hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 49.--Detail of wooden Davis quadrant inscribed\r\n\"Made by William Williams in King Street Boston\" for \"Malachi Allen\r\n1768.\" In collection of East India Marine Hall, Peabody Museum, Salem,\r\nMassachusetts.]\r\n\r\nThe name of Williams appears also in the Day Books of Paul Revere. Under\r\ndate of April 16, 1792, there is the following entry:\r\n\r\n    Mr. William Williams Dr\r\n    To Engravg plate for hatt bills 0-18-0\r\n    To 2 hund prints 0-6-0.\r\n\r\nFrom June 24, 1792, to January 28, 1797, Revere entered 12 charges\r\nagainst Williams for 8,500 hat bills for the total amount of\r\nL14/15/0.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samuel Thaxter_\r\n\r\nClosely associated with the name of William Williams is that of another\r\ninstrument maker of Boston, Samuel Thaxter (1769-1842). Thaxter was born\r\nin Hingham, Massachusetts, on December 13, 1769, the son of Samuel and\r\nBathsheba (Lincoln) Thaxter. His father, who had been born in Hingham in\r\n1744, was married on December 27, 1768, and he became the father of six\r\nchildren, of whom Samuel was the eldest. Samuel Thaxter, Sr., was\r\napparently a man of means, for he is listed as a \"Gentleman\" and a loyal\r\nsubject of King George. He resided on North Street in Hingham, near Ship\r\nStreet. He died on the island of Campobello at the age of 44 years on\r\nMay 27, 1788.[105]\r\n\r\nSamuel Thaxter, as well as several generations of his family before him,\r\nwas born in the old Thomas Thaxter mansion that was built by the settler\r\nof that name in 1652. During the Revolution Samuel's father, Maj. Samuel\r\nThaxter, concealed Tories from the Committee of Safety in a blind\r\npassage with a secret door in the old house. From there he smuggled them\r\nto Boston. At the massacre of Fort William, Major Thaxter was one of\r\nthose captured by the Indians. While tied to a tree, he saw two French\r\nofficers, and demanded whether this was the treatment they gave to\r\ncommissioned officers. They allowed him to go free and he dragged\r\nhimself to Fort Edward. Meanwhile, his comrades had reported him missing\r\nin action, and Dr. Gay preached his funeral sermon in Hingham shortly\r\nbefore Thaxter's return. The old Thaxter mansion was torn down in\r\n1864.[106]\r\n\r\nYoung Samuel Thaxter moved from Hingham to Boston, where he is first\r\nheard of in 1792. On June 14, 1792, Thaxter married Polly Helyer, the\r\nniece of William Williams.\r\n\r\nWithin a month after the sale of Williams' property at public auction,\r\nThaxter acquired the instrument-making business. Apparently the new\r\nowner of the premises required the business to move, and Thaxter\r\nestablished himself at No. 9 Butler's Row. A month after the Williams\r\nauction Thaxter announced his new location in an advertisement (fig. 50)\r\nin _The Columbia Centinel_ of May 22, 1793.\r\n\r\nThaxter's new location was a wooden store structure, on the north side\r\nof Butler's Row that was owned by Andrew Hall and Eunice Fitch in 1798.\r\nIt was in the rear of the north side of State Street, running from\r\nMerchants Row to the water.\r\n\r\nBy 1796 Thaxter had moved from this location to No. 49 State Street, on\r\nthe north side opposite to Broad Street, a brick store owned by Joseph\r\nLovering & Sons, tallow chandlers. He continued to do business at this\r\naddress until 1815, when he moved to 27 State Street, on the opposite\r\nside of the street. The new location was in a brick dwelling, opposite\r\nMerchants Row, that was owned by Joseph Clough, a housewright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 50.--Advertisement of Samuel Thaxter in _The\r\nColumbia Centinel_, May 22, 1793. Photo courtesy Harvard University\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\nIn about 1825 Thaxter moved his business once more, to 125 State Street,\r\nthe east corner of Broad Street. This building was occupied by Charles\r\nStimpson, Jr., a stationer who was one of the publishers of the _Boston\r\nAnnual Advertiser_, which was annexed to the Boston Directory of 1826.\r\nThe building was owned by Jonathan Phillips, the first mayor of Boston.\r\nIn the cellar of the building was a victualler named Augustus\r\nAdams.[107]\r\n\r\nThe dominating feature of Thaxter's shop from the time it was opened was\r\nthe carved figure of \"The Little Admiral,\" the trade sign first used by\r\nWilliams.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Samuel Thaxter eventually became Samuel Thaxter & Son, and\r\nit continued with that name until past the middle of the 19th century.\r\nSamuel Thaxter died in April 1842 at the age of 72 years. The entry for\r\nthe firm in the 1843 City Directory listed S. T. Cushing as the new\r\nowner. From the initials, it seems likely that his full name was\r\nSamuel Thaxter Cushing, and that he was the grandson of the original\r\nSamuel Thaxter. S. T. Cushing continued to be listed as the owner of the\r\nfirm until 1899, when he was succeeded by A. T. Cushing, presumably a\r\nson of the former. The old store was finally demolished in 1901.[108]\r\nComparison of a photograph of the building just before its demolition\r\nwith a copy of Thaxter's trade card (fig. 51) of the mid-19th century\r\nshows that the building underwent little change in the period. The\r\n\"Little Admiral\" is barely visible in both views.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 51.--19th-century trade card in collection of the\r\nBostonian Society.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 52.--Mahogany surveying compass made by Samuel\r\nThaxter of Boston.

In collection of the writer.]\r\n\r\nIn 1796, shortly after his marriage, Thaxter made his home on\r\n\r\nFish Street (now North Street), but in 1800 he was living at 54 Middle\r\nStreet (Hanover Street). By 1807 he had moved to a new home on Fleet\r\nStreet. His last home address, at the time of his death, was 41 Pinckney\r\nStreet.[109]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 53.--Compass card from earlier form of wooden\r\nsurveying compass made by Samuel Thaxter of Boston. From an instrument\r\nin the collection of the writer.]\r\n\r\nIn the collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society there is a\r\nreceipted bill (fig. 55) from Samuel Thaxter dated July 1, 1801, to Sam\r\nBrown, for touching up and repairing nine compasses for the French\r\ncorvelle _Berceau_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 54.--Brass surveying compass made and sold by S.\r\nThaxter & Son, Boston, in late 18th or early 19th century.

In collection of Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Dupee_\r\n\r\nJohn Dupee of Boston apparently was another instrument maker of the\r\npre-Revolutionary period actively engaged in producing wooden surveying\r\ncompasses. Three wooden instruments with his compass card exist in\r\nprivate and public collections. The instruments are quite similar: the\r\nwood in each case is walnut or applewood, with an engraved paper\r\nmariner's compass card; a schooner at sea is figured within the central\r\nmedallion, and inscribed within the riband enclosing it are the words\r\n\"Made and Sold by JOHN DUPEE Ye North Side of Swing Bridge Boston New\r\nEng.\" One of the instruments is owned by the South Natick\r\n[Massachusetts] Historical Society; a second example is in the\r\ncollection of the Bostonian Society; and a third is owned by a private\r\ncollector.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of a maker of scientific instruments or clocks by the\r\nname of Dupee, although the name John Dupee occurs in the city records\r\nof Boston during the early decades of the 18th century. An advertisement\r\nin the February 9, 1761, issue of _The Boston Gazette_ states that\r\n\r\n     ISAAC DUPEE, Carver, Advertises his Customers and others, that\r\n     since the late Fire (on Dock Square) he has opened a shop the North\r\n     side of the Swing-Bridge, opposite to _Thomas Tyler's_, Esq.; where\r\n     Business will be carried on as usual with Fidelity and Dispatch.\r\n\r\nThe natural assumption would be that the three instruments were produced\r\nin Isaac Dupee's shop after 1761, perhaps by the carver's son. The use\r\nof an engraved compass card indicates that the instruments were not\r\nunique, and that a number of others were produced or contemplated. On\r\nthe other hand, it is likely that the maker produced other types of\r\ninstruments utilizing such a card, such as mariner's compasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jere Clough_\r\n\r\nAnother instrument maker, presumably of Boston, is Jere Clough. The only\r\ninstrument bearing his name known at present is a surveying compass\r\n(fig. 56), made of wood, in the Streeter Collection of Weights and\r\nMeasures at Yale University. Clough's name does not appear on any of the\r\nlists of instrument makers or clockmakers, yet it is a name that is\r\nfairly prevalent in Boston. In 1741, for instance, one Joseph Clough of\r\nBoston was a maker of bellows. He produced bellows of all types--for\r\nfurnaces, refiners, blacksmiths, braziers, and goldsmiths.[110]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 56.--Wooden instrument made by Jere Clough. In\r\nStreeter Collection of Weights and Measures, Yale University.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 57.--Wooden surveying compass made by Andrew\r\nNewell (1749-1798) of Boston. It is made of mahogany, is 11-1/2 in.\r\nlong, and has a diameter of 5 in. The engraved compass card is signed by\r\nNathaniel Hurd, goldsmith, silversmith, and engraver of Boston. In\r\ncollection of Yale University Art Gallery.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Andrew Newell_\r\n\r\nAn instrument of considerable significance is another wooden surveyor's\r\ncompass, in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery. This\r\ncompass (fig. 57) is made of rich brown San Domingo mahogany with\r\nsighting bars of boxwood. A mariner's card, set into the opening with a\r\nmetal vernier scale, is in the usual form of the mariner's compass card\r\nof the 18th century; it is executed as a line engraving. A ship and the\r\nBoston harbor lighthouse are featured in the central medallion. On a\r\nriband encircling the medallion is the inscription \"Made by ANDW. NEWELL\r\nEast End of the MARKET BOSTON,\" Engraved in script at the southern tip\r\nof the star is the signature \"N. Hurd Sct.\"\r\n\r\nRelatively little is known about Andrew Newell (1749-1798) except that\r\nhe was a maker of mathematical instruments. An entry in the first Boston\r\ndirectory, in 1789, listed \"Andrew Newell, instrument maker, 61 State\r\nStreet.\" The directory of 1796 mentioned Newell as having a shop on the\r\n\"East side of the Market,\" the address that appears on the surveying\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nTwo years later the Boston directory listed Andrew Newell and Son, and\r\nin 1800 the listing included only the name of Joseph Newell, who may\r\nhave been the son. Another mathematical instrument maker named Charles\r\nNewell may have been another son of Andrew Newell; his name does not\r\nappear in the city Directory until in the 19th century. An instrument\r\nwith the signature \"Newell & Son, Makers, East End of Faneuil Hall,\r\nBoston\" is in the collection of the Bostonian Society.\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the Newell instrument is the fact that the\r\nengraver of the compass card was Nathaniel Hurd (1729-1777), the peer of\r\ngoldsmiths and engravers of the colonial period. This compass card is a\r\npreviously unrecorded example of Hurd's work, and constitutes a work of\r\nart, making the compass a historic scientific instrument.[111] The\r\ncompass was presented to the Yale University Art Gallery by a Yale\r\nalumnus, Mr. Henry G. Schiff of New York City. No other examples have\r\nthus far been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aaron Breed_\r\n\r\nAaron Breed (1791-1861) is a relatively unknown maker of mathematical\r\ninstruments who worked in Boston into the 19th century. He specialized\r\nin nautical, mathematical and optical instruments, with an address at\r\n173 Broad Street, and another at No. 2 Rowe's Wharf, \"At the Sign of the\r\nQuadrant.\" Breed made surveying instruments in brass and in wood. A\r\nbrass instrument is in the Henry Ford Museum, and a wooden instrument is\r\nin the collection of Old Sturbridge Village. The latter is fashioned\r\nfrom walnut with an engraved compass card inscribed \"Aaron Breed\r\nBoston.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charles Thacher_\r\n\r\nThe name of Charles Thacher appears on the compass card of a wooden\r\nsurveying compass (fig. 58) in the collection of the Mariners' Museum,\r\nNorfolk, Virginia. No record of this maker has been found, but the\r\nengraved compass card indicates that he probably worked in New England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 58.--Wooden surveying compass made by Charles\r\nThacher. It is made of cherry or maple; sighting bars are of oak.\r\nOver-all length, 13-5/8 in.

William\r\nGuyse Hagger's name did not appear in the 1790 census of Newport, and it\r\nis presumed that he moved with his family to Boston.\r\n\r\nBenjamin King Hagger was listed in the first city directory of Boston in\r\n1789 as \"a mathematical instrument maker\" with an address on Ann Street;\r\nhe was only 20 years of age at this time.\r\n\r\nOn November 10, 1793, Benjamin King Hagger, \"mathematical instrument\r\nmaker,\" purchased land with buildings on Prince Street near Snow Hill\r\nStreet from one Peter Greene. Two years later, on December 1, 1795,\r\nHagger, now listed simply as a \"merchant,\" purchased a brick house, a\r\nwooden house, and a shed with land from William Ballard, a tailor of\r\nFramingham and an heir of Samuel Ballard. The property was located on\r\nthe east side of North Street, south of Mill Creek. At the time of\r\npurchase, Hagger mortgaged the property to Ballard, and also mortgaged\r\nto him the house and land previously purchased from Greene.\r\n\r\nHagger was listed as a ship chandler in the following year when on March\r\n24, 1796, he deeded part of his land on Prince Street to William and\r\nGeorge Hillman, minors.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 1796, three months later, Hagger, now listed as\r\n\"mathematical instrument maker, and ship-chandler\" deeded to a mariner\r\nnamed Thomas Wallis a house and land that formed part of his original\r\npurchase near Copp's Hill from Peter Greene. Then on July 21, 1796, he\r\npurchased from William Ballard all his right to the brick house and land\r\non North Street (Ann Street), at the same time mortgaging the property\r\nto William Ballard, Jr., of Framingham. This mortgage was cancelled on\r\nApril 11, 1798.[112]\r\n\r\nThese negotiations took place before marriage. A report of the Record\r\nCommissioners of Boston, states that \"William King Hagger of Boston and\r\nMehitable Ballard of Framingham were married October 6, 1796.\" The\r\nentry appears to be in error because the marriage intentions had read\r\n\"Benjamin King Hagger.\" It is presumed that Mehitable was the daughter\r\nof William Ballard, the tailor of Framingham, from whom Hagger had\r\nbought his house on Ann Street, south of Mill Creek.[113]\r\n\r\nBenjamin King Hagger is listed in the city directory of Boston for 1798\r\nas a \"mathematical instrument maker\" on Ann Street. This, however, is\r\nthe last listing for his name in Boston, as his name does not appear in\r\nthe 1803 or subsequent directories.\r\n\r\nShortly after 1798 Hagger appears to have left Boston together with his\r\nwife, and it is probable that he established himself as an instrument\r\nmaker in another Massachusetts community, at present unknown. In about\r\n1816 Hagger moved with his family to Baltimore and continued his\r\ninstrument-making business.\r\n\r\nThe records of the 1850 Federal census of Baltimore indicate that two of\r\nHagger's sons, John W. and William G. Hagger, had been born in 1800 and\r\n1806 respectively, in Massachusetts, presumably in the community to\r\nwhich Hagger had moved from Boston before moving once more to Baltimore.\r\n\r\nAccording to Matchett's Baltimore directory for 1824, Hagger was a\r\n\"mathematical and optical instrument maker\" with a shop at 57 South\r\nStreet. His advertisement in the directory stated that he\r\n\r\n     Respectfully acquaints his fellow citizens that he executes all\r\n     orders in the line of his business with punctuality and confidently\r\n     professes to give satisfaction to his employers, from the\r\n     experience of a regular apprenticeship and 37 years practice.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that Hagger completed his apprenticeship in 1787, when he\r\nwas 18, and since then had been established in his own business or had\r\nworked for another as a journeyman instrument maker. His first\r\nadvertisement in the Boston directory appeared in 1789, wherein his shop\r\nwas listed as being on Ann Street.\r\n\r\nHagger died in Baltimore on November 8, 1834, at the age of 65, after a\r\nresidence of 18 years in that city.[114]\r\n\r\nThus far only one instrument by Hagger has been found--a wooden\r\nsurveying instrument or semicircumferentor (fig. 59). It is in the\r\npossession of the writer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 59.--Wooden graphometer made by Benjamin King\r\nHagger (c. 1769-1834) of Boston and Baltimore.

Photos courtesy The\r\nAmerican Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nProduction of wooden surveying compasses was not limited to Boston.\r\nAnother instrument maker who produced them was Benjamin Warren (c.\r\n1740-?) of Plymouth, Massachusetts. The name of Benjamin Warren was a\r\nfairly common one in Plymouth, being a name handed down in the family\r\nfrom father to son for at least five generations before 1800. The first\r\nBenjamin Warren at Plymouth was married in 1697, and his son Benjamin\r\n(2) was born in 1698. Benjamin (2) was married in due course, and his\r\nson Benjamin (3) was born in 1740. The third Benjamin was the father of\r\nBenjamin (4), who was born in 1766. In 1789 Benjamin (4) married Sarah\r\nYoung, the daughter of Daniel Young, and their son Benjamin (5) was born\r\nin 1792. The Benjamin Warren who operated the shop in Plymouth probably\r\nwas Benjamin Warren (3), who was then about 45 years of age.[115]\r\n\r\nA search of _The Plymouth Journal & Massachusetts Advertiser_ has\r\nrevealed several advertisements and notices (fig. 60) about Benjamin\r\nWarren from which some information can be derived about the man and his\r\nbusiness during this period. The first known notice dated March 19,\r\n1785, probably is the most important one. Later in the same year, on\r\nAugust 16, 1785, Warren published the following notice:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS on Friday Morning of the 5th inst. eloped from the House of\r\n     the subscriber, _Inholder_ in Plymouth, JOHN MOREY, of NORTON, of\r\n     tall stature, & round shoulder'd. Had on when he absconded, a\r\n     shabby claret coloured coat, adorned with patches, and a pair of\r\n     dirty smoak'd coloured breeches; without knee-buckles; and an old\r\n     flopped hatt, defaced with grease.\r\n\r\n     As he appeared to be an enterprising genius, without abilities,\r\n     politeness or honesty, and went off in an abrupt and clandestine\r\n     manner; a reward of _Sixpence_ will be paid, to any person or\r\n     persons, who will persuade or induce the said Morey to make his\r\n     appearance once more to the subscriber.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that Warren was not considerably concerned about the\r\nreturn of John Morey, for the reward offered was scarcely conducive to\r\nobtain the public's cooperation. Warren's first ventures with public\r\nsales must have been successful, for early in the next year, in the\r\nissue of January 3, 1786, he announced that\r\n\r\n     _Benjamin Warren_,\r\n\r\n     PROPOSES to open a convenient AUCTION-ROOM, over the Shop he now\r\n     trades in, next week. Any Gentlemen that will furnish him with\r\n     goods of any kind for Public or Private sale, on Commission, shall\r\n     be served with fidelity, and the smallest favours in that way\r\n     gratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe next notice of the auction-room appeared on February 21, 1786, when\r\nthe newspaper advertised that\r\n\r\n     _To-morrow_ will be SOLD, by Public Vendue, At WARREN'S Auction\r\n     Room,\r\n\r\n     A VARIETY of articles, _viz_. Nails, Bar Lead, Glass Pewter,\r\n     Buttons, Buckles, Chairs, Stands, &c, &c, &c.\r\n\r\n     *** The SALE to begin at 10 o'Clock, A.M.\r\n\r\nNo other notices of public sales appeared in the _Journal_ for the next\r\nseveral months. The last notice of this period was another announcement\r\nof a sale, which was published in the issue of May 30, 1786:\r\n\r\n     _Publick Vendue_,\r\n\r\n     _At_ WARREN's Auction Room, in PLYMOUTH: at Ten o'clock this\r\n     morning. WILL be Sold, a quantity of bar lead, boxes of glass, 6 x\r\n     8. English Shovels and Tongs, bridle-Bits, and a variety of other\r\n     articles of Hard-Ware. Also, a few Anvils at private sale.\r\n\r\nOnly one instrument signed by Warren is known to survive; it is a wooden\r\nsurveying compass (fig. 61) in the Streeter Collection of Weights and\r\nMeasures at Yale University. The instrument, which appears to have been\r\nmade from walnut, has a compass card with the following inscription\r\naround the central medallion: \"Made and sold by BENJAMIN WARREN Plymouth\r\nNew Eng^d.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 61.--Wooden surveying compass made by Benjamin\r\nWarren (c. 1740-c. 1800) of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and detail of the\r\ncompass card. The compass, made of cherry wood, is 12 in. long and has a\r\ndiameter of 6 in. In Streeter Collection of Weights and Measures, Yale\r\nUniversity.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 62.--Detail of card, Warren surveying compass\r\nshown in figure 61.]\r\n\r\nThe medallion (fig. 62) encloses a harbor scene with a brigantine of the\r\n1740 period off a promontory on which is prominently situated a\r\nlighthouse with a smaller building partly visible at the left. The\r\nlighthouse is unusual in construction in that it features twin towers\r\nrising from a large rectangular wooden building.\r\n\r\nAs far as can be determined from available records, the only lighthouse\r\nin America of this period having such construction was the noted Gurnet\r\nLight, which was built at the tip of Duxbury Beach in Plymouth Bay in\r\n1768. D. Alan Stevenson[116] relates that the Governor's Council of\r\nMassachusetts, when it decided in 1768 to erect the Gurnet Lighthouse\r\nat Plymouth, adopted a novel plan to distinguish it from other American\r\nlighthouses. \"This consisted of double lights set horizontally in the\r\nsame structure. A timber house built at a cost of L660, 30' long and 20'\r\nhigh, had a lanthorn at each end to contain two four-wick lamps.\r\n\r\n\"In 1802 fire destroyed the house but the merchants of the town promptly\r\nsubscribed to replace it by temporary lights, as the Government had no\r\nimmediate funds at its disposal. An Act of Congress of 1802 allotted\r\n$2500 for building another set of twin lights and reimbursing the\r\nmerchants for their expenditure.\r\n\r\n\"Though the idea of twin lights at Plymouth seemed an excellent\r\ndistinction from a single navigation light shown at Barnstable harbor in\r\nthe vicinity, they proved not entirely advantageous and a sea captain\r\nblamed them for causing his shipwreck. He had seen the light from only\r\none tower and identified it with confidence as the Barnstable light;\r\napparently, from a particular direction one tower hid the other. But\r\nlocal prejudice in favor of retaining the twin lights as a distinction\r\nprevailed until 1924 when, at last, opposition ceased to the\r\nrecommendation which the Lighthouse Board expressed frequently that a\r\nsingle light would be preferable.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems quite likely that the compass card bears one of the very few\r\nsurviving contemporary representations of the first Gurnet Light in\r\nPlymouth Bay. A search of the archives of the historical societies in\r\nPlymouth, Boston, and Worcester and the files of the U.S. National\r\nArchives has failed to reveal any illustration of this famous\r\nlighthouse.\r\n\r\nQuite by coincidence, the name of Benjamin Warren was discovered among\r\nthe entries of the day books of Paul Revere, the famous patriot,\r\nsilversmith, and engraver. The entry[117] (fig. 63) appears as follows:\r\n\r\n    1786 March 13. Benjm Warren Dr. Plimouth\r\n    To printing one hundred Compass Cards 0-18-0.\r\n\r\nWhether the compass card on the Warren instrument was produced by Revere\r\nis difficult to determine. Authorities on Revere's engravings agree that\r\nit could have been engraved by Revere but are unable to state it\r\npositively. It has been suggested that the entry in Revere's day book\r\nindicates that he merely printed the compass cards for Warren and that\r\nhe did not engrave a plate. The charge for the work bears out this\r\nsupposition; and furthermore, Revere's bills seemed to make a definite\r\ndistinction between the engraving of plates and actual prints. Whether\r\nor not Revere was responsible for making the original engraving remains\r\nto be determined, but it is very probable that he printed the compass\r\ncard of the instrument in the Streeter Collection of Weights and\r\nMeasures at Yale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 63.--Page from the \"day books\" of Paul Revere with\r\nentry for the printing of compass cards for Benjamin Warren of Plymouth.\r\nIn collection of Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daniel Burnap_\r\n\r\nOne of the best known and most respected names among Connecticut\r\nclockmakers is that of Daniel Burnap (1759-1838) of East Windsor. Burnap\r\nwas born in Coventry in 1759 and served an apprenticeship with Thomas\r\nHarland, clockmaker of Norwich. In about 1780 Burnap opened his own\r\nestablishment, where he combined the crafts of clockmaking,\r\ncabinetmaking, and engraving of brass, in all of which he was greatly\r\nskilled. One of his apprentices was Eli Terry, who later achieved fame\r\nin the craft in his own right.[118]\r\n\r\nBurnap's business included clients in Windsor, Hartford, and Coventry,\r\nas well as some of the leading merchants and cabinetmakers of the nearby\r\ncities and towns. Although clockmaking was the primary business in which\r\nBurnap engaged, he also had a large trade for his surveying instruments,\r\nsilver spoons, gold beads, harness and saddlery hardware, and shoe\r\nbuckles.\r\n\r\nBurnap prospered, and in about 1800 he moved back to his native town,\r\nCoventry. There he purchased a large farm and erected a shop and a\r\nsawmill, and in due course became the leading citizen of the community.\r\nHe died in 1838, leaving a valuable technological record in the\r\ncompleteness of his journals and account books. A study of the entries\r\nof his day books and ledgers (see fig. 64) reveals that Burnap did a\r\nsubstantial amount of business in surveying compasses, chains, and\r\nprotractors. Among his shop equipment after his death there was found an\r\nunfinished protractor, but no examples of his instruments are known\r\nexcept for a compass dial, inscribed with his name, that was discovered\r\nrecently in the collection of a midwestern historical society.[119]\r\n\r\nIt is significant to note that Burnap made instruments of varying\r\nquality. For instance, he charged three different prices for his\r\nsurveyor's compasses. The highest-priced compasses cost L6; they were\r\nmade of brass, and were of the more elaborate conventional type used by\r\nsurveyors. A few examples that appeared in his records cost L4; these\r\nalso were made of brass, but probably were of a simpler form. Several\r\nentries list surveying compasses priced at L2 and L2/8. One of these was\r\nmade for Capt. Solomon Dewie (1750-1813) in September 1790 for L2/8. At\r\nthe same time, Burnap charged him L0/1/6 for touching the needle of\r\nanother compass.[120] The entries in Burnap's account books do not state\r\nthat these inexpensive compasses were constructed of wood, but it seems\r\nto be sufficiently conclusive that they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gurdon Huntington_\r\n\r\nGurdon Huntington (1763-1804) was not primarily a maker of scientific\r\ninstruments, but he was established as a goldsmith and clockmaker. He\r\nwas born in Windham, Connecticut, on April 30, 1763, the son of\r\nHezekiah and Submit (Murdock) Huntington.[121]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 64.--Entry in the manuscript ledgers of Daniel\r\nBurnap (1759-1838) of East Windsor and Coventry, Connecticut, for sale\r\nof surveying compass in 1790. Reproduced from the Burnap shop records in\r\nthe collection of Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford.]\r\n\r\nThe Huntington family was one of the most important in Connecticut\r\ncolonial history. Gurdon's father, Hezekiah, was in service during the\r\nRevolutionary War, going to Boston as a major with the first troops\r\nraised in Connecticut. When in Boston he witnessed the miserable\r\ncondition of the arms then in the hands of the soldiers. Major\r\nHuntington went immediately to Philadelphia, where Congress was in\r\nsession, and proposed to the Congress that he would return to his home\r\nin Windham and that there he would open a manufactory for repairing\r\nmuskets and other arms. He claimed to have been the first man to have\r\nmade a gun in the Colonies.\r\n\r\nGurdon was too young to have served in the Revolution, but he\r\nundoubtedly worked in his father's gun manufactory as a boy. In due\r\ncourse he learned the trades of goldsmith and clockmaker and established\r\nhis own shop in Windham, which, according to an advertisement (fig. 65)\r\nin _The Connecticut Gazette_ of June 11, 1784, was \"a few rods north of\r\nMajor Ebenezer Backus' store.\"\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day, 1785, Gurdon was married in New London to Temperance\r\nWilliams of Groton. In 1789 their first child, Marvin, was born, and in\r\nOctober of the same year the Huntingtons moved from Windham to Walpole,\r\nNew Hampshire. No reason can be found for the move, other than the\r\npossibility that Gurdon might have anticipated greater opportunity in\r\nthe new community. There he applied himself to his trade as goldsmith\r\nand clockmaker, but apparently he was not very successful. His family\r\ngrew, and by the time of his death there were eight children. Possibly\r\nin an effort to supplement his income, Huntington served as postmaster\r\nof the community. In about 1797, seven or eight years after he had moved\r\nto Walpole, his father and mother joined him there, and it is believed\r\nthat Major Hezekiah may have worked as a gunsmith during that period.\r\nEventually the senior Huntington returned to Windham, Connecticut, where\r\nhe died in 1807.[122]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Gurdon Huntington struggled on until his death on July 26,\r\n1804. He died insolvent, which created a considerable problem in view of\r\nthe large family he left behind him. Huntington's estate was\r\nadministered by Asa Sibley, a clockmaker in Walpole. Sibley had moved\r\nto Walpole from his home in Woodstock, Connecticut, in the 1790's and he\r\nremained there until 1808, when he again returned to Woodstock. Gurdon\r\nHuntington's widow removed to Bloomfield, Ohio, with her children, and\r\nshe died there on May 25, 1823. Most of her children settled in\r\nBloomfield, but several of them moved to New Hartford, New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 65.--Advertisement of Gurdon Huntington\r\n(1763-1804) in _The Connecticut Gazette_, June 11, 1784. In collection\r\nof Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 66.--Views of wooden surveying compass made by\r\nGurdon Huntington, clockmaker in Walpole, New Hampshire, between\r\n1789-1804. Made of cherry with folding brass sighting bars, the\r\ninstrument is 14 in. long and 5-1/2 in. wide. In collection of the\r\nwriter.]\r\n\r\nSeveral examples of Huntington's clocks are known to exist in private\r\ncollections in the United States. However, only one example of his\r\nscientific instruments appears to have survived. This is a surveying\r\ncompass (fig. 66) made of wood, with brass sighting bars and a painted\r\ndial under glass with a steel needle. The dial is inscribed \"G.\r\nHUNTINGTON/WALPOLE.\" The instrument, which is in the collection of the\r\nwriter, is made of cherry wood, with a riveted ball-and-socket joint of\r\nbrass for insertion on a tripod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jedidiah Baldwin_\r\n\r\nJedidiah Baldwin (fl. 1790's) was another early New England clock and\r\ninstrument maker, but little is known of his early life. He was a\r\nbrother of Jabes Baldwin (c. 1777-1829), who worked as a clockmaker in\r\nSalem and Boston after serving an apprenticeship with Thomas Harland in\r\nNorwich, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nJedidiah Baldwin also served an apprenticeship with Harland. In 1791 he\r\nwas working in Northampton, Massachusetts, as a member of the firm of\r\nStiles and Baldwin, and from 1792 to 1794 he was a member of the firm of\r\nStiles and Storrs, in partnership with Nathan Storrs.[123] In about 1794\r\nBaldwin moved to Hanover, New Hampshire, where he became the local\r\npostmaster, and where Dartmouth College records his death.\r\n\r\nOnly one existing instrument is known to have been made by Baldwin; it\r\nis a wooden surveying compass with a brass dial having two scales, one\r\nfor degrees and one for eight divisions per 90 deg.. The dial is inscribed\r\n\"JED BALDWIN/HANOVER.\" According to its present owner, Mr. Worth\r\nShampeny of Rochester, Vermont, the compass was used for surveying in\r\nVermont during the early 1800's.\r\n\r\nAnother Jedidiah Baldwin worked as a clockmaker in Morrisville, New\r\nYork, from 1818-1820 and then in Fairfield, New York; he appears also in\r\nthe city directory of Rochester, New York, as a clockmaker during the\r\nyears 1834-1844. He may have been a son or grandson of the first\r\nJedidiah, or a nephew.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Salter Bowles_\r\n\r\nThomas Salter Bowles (c. 1765-?) is another elusive New England\r\ninstrument maker about whom little information is available. He is\r\nbelieved to have been the son of Deacon Samuel and Hannah (Salter)\r\nBowles, born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, probably between 1765 and\r\n1770. His father was born in 1739; his mother, who was the daughter of\r\nCaptain Titus Salter, was born in 1748 and died in 1831.[124] Deacon\r\nBowles was clerk of the Brick Market in Portsmouth from 1801 to the time\r\nof his death, November 3, 1802. There is a minimum of information\r\navailable from church and city records in the community, but it is\r\nbelieved that he was a member of one of the offshoots of the established\r\nPuritan Church, and hence he would not appear in its records. He kept\r\nthe lower school in the Brick School House on State Street for a number\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the Bowles family first came to Portsmouth during\r\nthe few years immediately before the beginning of the Revolutionary War.\r\nIt is known that a Thomas Bowles and a Samuel Bowles both signed the\r\nAssociation Test on August 14, 1776, promising to oppose the hostile\r\nproceedings of the British fleets and armies. Furthermore, one of the\r\nprincipal taxpayers in Portsmouth in 1770 was a firm named Griffith and\r\nBowles, which paid L17 in taxes in 1770. The name of the Bowles who\r\nformed part of this firm is not known, but it was either Samuel or the\r\nfirst Thomas Bowles. The other partner was Nathaniel S. Griffith, a\r\nwatchmaker. It is possible that a tradition of instrument making existed\r\nin the Bowles family even then.[125]\r\n\r\nOn file in the office of the City Clerk in Portsmouth are two\r\ncertificates of marriage made out by Thomas Salter Bowles. The first is\r\nfor his marriage to Hannah Ham, a ceremony performed on September 21,\r\n1809, by Joseph Walton, one of the pastors of a church dissenting from\r\nthe Puritan regime. Hannah was the daughter of William Ham, a brother of\r\nSupply Ham (1788-1862), a noted local clockmaker. Bowles may have served\r\nan apprenticeship in that shop before he married Hannah. Two other\r\nmembers of the Ham family--George Ham and Henry H. Ham--worked as\r\nwatchmakers in Portsmouth in the same period.\r\n\r\nA search of the cemeteries has indicated that Hannah Ham Bowles died in\r\n1811, age 20. She is buried with her infant son in North Cemetery.[126]\r\n\r\nThomas Bowles's second marriage certificate in Portsmouth is for his\r\nmarriage on September 29, 1813--two years after Hannah's death--to Abiah\r\nEmerly Bradley of Haverhill, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nLittle is known about the work of Bowles as an instrument maker except\r\nthrough a few of his instruments. He is listed in the first Portsmouth\r\ndirectory, of 1821, as a \"mathematical instrument maker\" with a place of\r\nbusiness on Daniel Street; his home was given as Austin Street in\r\nPortsmouth. He did not appear in the city's directories of 1827 and\r\n1834. It is assumed that he may have left Portsmouth in the interim,\r\npossibly to settle in his wife's home town of Haverhill.\r\n\r\nThree instruments signed by Bowles have survived, and all show signs of\r\nconsiderable wear. They are surveying compasses made of walnut, having\r\nmaple sighting bars and a silvered brass vernier set under the glass.\r\nTwo examples, one in the Streeter Collection of Weights and Measures at\r\nYale University and one owned by this writer are almost identical in\r\nsize, form, and details. The only variation is that the Yale example\r\n(fig. 67) has a bubble level under a brass strip set into one end, an\r\nitem lacking in the other example (fig. 68).\r\n\r\nThe compass card, made from a line engraving, is identical in each of\r\nthe three examples. A floriated fleur-de-lis on the North point has a\r\ncompass and square at its base, and the name T. S. BOWLES is on a riband\r\nover it. Adorning the East point is an American eagle bearing a shield\r\nwith stars and stripes and clutching arrows in one claw and a laurel\r\ntwig in the other. In a ring within the central medallion is inscribed\r\n(see fig. 68), \"* T. S. BOWLES * PORTSMOUTH, N.H. *\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 67.--Wooden surveying compass made by Thomas\r\nSalter Bowles of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. With spirit level. Made of\r\nbirch, the compass is 13 in. long and has a diameter of 6 in. In the\r\nStreeter Collection of Weights and Measures, Yale University.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the three instruments was acquired by the\r\nDartmouth Museum as part of a collection of the late Frank C. Churchill,\r\nan inspector in the Indian Service. The instrument (fig. 69) is a\r\nquarter circle with a compass in its center and sighting bars mounted on\r\na swinging arm that reads the angle of the brass scale on the arc by\r\nmeans of a vernier. It is mounted on a wooden tripod with the customary\r\nball-and-socket joint, which permits it to be placed on a vertical\r\nplane. A built-in plumb bob at the side helps to establish the\r\nvertical.[127]\r\n\r\nInteresting features of this instrument are two inscriptions engraved on\r\nthe brass strip on the top of the dial. One states that it was \"INVENTED\r\nBY P. MERRILL ESQ.\" and the other relates that it was \"MADE BY JOHN\r\nKENNARD NEWMARKET.\" No information about P. Merrill has been found, and\r\nit is presumed that it was he who conceived the idea of combining the\r\nvarious elements into a single instrument and that it was made under his\r\ndirection by Kennard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 68.--Wooden surveying compass made by Thomas\r\nSalter Bowles (1765/70-post 1821) of Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

In Frank C. Churchill Collection, Dartmouth\r\nCollege Museum, Hanover, New Hampshire.]\r\n\r\nSome data on Kennard is available in a history of Newfields (formerly\r\nNewmarket) by Reverend Fitts. John Kennard was born in Kittery, Maine,\r\nin 1782. He learned the trade of clockmaker in Portsmouth, New\r\nHampshire, presumably working with the members of the Ham family or\r\nothers. On July 3, 1806, he married Sarah Ewer. He lived for various\r\nperiods in Nashua and Concord before moving to Newfields in 1812. He\r\nlived in the Palmer house (which was burned in September 1899), and he\r\nkept a store in the little community and also served as its postmaster\r\nfrom 1822 to 1824. The post office was the only public office in the\r\ntown until the cotton mills were built on the Lamprey River in 1823.\r\nKennard later built and occupied the Kennard house on Piscassic Street,\r\nwhich was subsequently owned by Jeremiah Towle and has since been\r\nburned. In December 1830 he established an iron foundry together with\r\nTemple Paul and the Drake family, but in 1834 he sold his interest to\r\nAmos Paul and others. He was the father of six children and he died in\r\n1861. During his lifetime he had specialized in making tall case and\r\nbanjo clocks.[128]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The New Era_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the 19th century saw increased trading and shipping\r\nresulting from the economic development of the new republic, and the\r\nwestward surge brought increased preoccupation with the settlement of\r\ncommunities and the development of land areas. As a consequence, the\r\ndemand for instruments likewise increased.\r\n\r\nWhereas during the 18th century and until some time after the end of the\r\nRevolutionary War probably not more than a dozen instrument makers and\r\ndealers are known to have emigrated from England or elsewhere to make\r\ntheir homes and careers in the American Colonies, the beginning of the\r\n19th century saw substantial numbers of English and French instrument\r\nmakers and dealers immigrate to the United States, to establish shops in\r\nthe major centers of trade.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the names of scarcely a hundred mathematical-instrument\r\nmakers who worked in the American Colonies during the 18th century are\r\nknown today, the names of hundreds of similar 19th-century craftsmen and\r\ndealers are to be found.\r\n\r\nAs Derek Price[129] has so cogently stated: \"For scientific instrument\r\nmakers, one need only examine the nineteenth century city directories of\r\nBoston, Philadelphia and New York to find hundreds of names of craftsmen\r\nand firms. It is, to be sure, an antiquarian research, for one does not\r\nexpect to find great discoveries coming from these people. But just as\r\nin Europe, it is a populous trade, influential in the growth of science\r\nand highly effective in spreading and intensifying the itch for\r\ningenious instruments and devices. It is by these men that the basic\r\nskills of the Industrial Revolution were populated....\" By such means\r\ndid American science and technology come of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The National Collection_\r\n\r\n_Early American Scientific Instruments and Related Materials in the\r\nUnited States National Museum, Listed by Makers and Users_\r\n\r\n\r\nADAMS, GEORGE; Fleet Street, London.

From the termination of this second line a third making a\r\n     right angle with it was carried South-Easterly ten miles: and from\r\n     the beginning on Jones' Point a fourth was carried ten miles to the\r\n     termination of the third. These lines were measured with a chain\r\n     which was examined and corrected daily, and plumbed whenever the\r\n     ground was uneven, and traced with a transit and equal altitude\r\n     instrument which I constructed and executed in 1789 and used in\r\n     running the Western boundary of the State of New York. This\r\n     instrument was similar to that described by Le Monnier in his\r\n     preface to the French \"Histoire Celeste.\" ... All the lines in this\r\n     city in which I have been concerned were traced with the same\r\n     instrument which I used on the lines of the ten mile square but as\r\n     the Northern part was not finished when I left that place, I cannot\r\n     pretend to say what method has since been pursued.\r\n\r\nDeposit of Andrew Ellicott Douglass of Flagstaff, Ariz., in 1931.

In The\r\n_Journal of Andrew Ellicott_ the instrument is described as a Zenith\r\nSector of 19 inches radius to be used when the utmost accuracy was not\r\nnecessary, and where the transportation of the large one could not be\r\neffected without great expense and difficulty. These instruments were\r\nprincipally executed by my late worthy and ingenious friend, Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, except some additions which I have made myself. The plumb\r\nlines of both Sectors are suspended from a notch above the axis of the\r\ninstruments in the manner described by the Rev. Dr. Maskelyne, the\r\npresent Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, in the introduction to the first\r\nvolume of his Astronomical Observations. A particular description of\r\nthose instruments is rendered unnecessary by being accurately done in a\r\nnumber of scientific works, particularly by M. de Maupertius in his\r\naccount of the measurement of a degree of the meridian under the Arctic\r\nCircle--The Sector is of all instruments the best calculated for\r\nmeasuring zenith distances which come within its arc. The large one\r\nabove mentioned [large Zenith Sector] extends to 5 degrees North, and\r\nSouth of the Zenith. Stars when so near the Zenith are insensibly\r\naffected by the different refractive powers of the Atmosphere arising\r\nfrom its different degrees of density. Add to this that the error of the\r\nvisual axis is completely corrected by taking the Zenith distances of\r\nthe stars with the plane, or face of the instrument both East and West.\r\n\r\nUSNM 152079.
