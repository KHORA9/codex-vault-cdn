It is\r\nto show the close connection between Nature and human inventions, and\r\nthat there is scarcely an invention of man that has not its prototype in\r\nNature. And it is worthy of notice that the greatest results have been\r\nobtained from means apparently the most insignificant.\r\n\r\nThere are two inventions, for example, which have changed the face of\r\nthe earth, and which yet sprang from sources that were despised by men,\r\nand thought only fit for the passing sport of childhood. I allude, of\r\ncourse, to Steam and Electricity, both of which had been child’s toys\r\nfor centuries before the one gave us the fixed engine, the locomotive,\r\nand the steamboat, and the other supplied us with the compass and the\r\nelectric telegraph.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this work I have placed side by side a great number of\r\nparallels of Nature and Art, making the descriptions as terse and simple\r\nas possible, and illustrating them with more than seven hundred and\r\nfifty figures. The corollary which I hope will be drawn from the work is\r\nevident enough. It is, that as existing human inventions have been\r\nanticipated by Nature, so it will surely be found that in Nature lie the\r\nprototypes of inventions not yet revealed to man. The great discoverers\r\nof the future will, therefore, be those who will look to Nature for\r\nArt, Science, or Mechanics, instead of taking pride in some new\r\ninvention, and then finding that it has existed in Nature for countless\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nI ought to mention that the illustrations are not intended to be\r\nfinished drawings, but merely charts or maps, calling attention to the\r\nsalient points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUTICAL.\r\n\r\nCHAP.

The first part\r\nof this rather sweeping assertion is perfectly true, but, as we shall\r\npresently see, the second portion is absolutely untrue.\r\n\r\nScience has certainly destroyed, and is destroying, many of the poetic\r\nfancies which made a part of daily life. It must have been a\r\nconsiderable shock to the mind of an ancient philosopher when he found\r\nhimself deprived of the semi-spiritual, semi-human beings with which the\r\nearth and water were thought to be peopled. And even in our own time and\r\ncountry there is in many places a still lingering belief in the\r\nexistence of good and bad fairies inhabiting lake, wood, and glen, the\r\nsuccessors of the Naiads and Dryads, the Fauns and Satyrs, of the former\r\ntime. Many persons will doubtless be surprised, even in these days, to\r\nhear that the dreaded Maelström is quite as fabulous as the Symplegades\r\nor Scylla and Charybdis, and that the well-known tale of Edgar Poe is\r\nabsolutely without foundation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the prettiest legends in natural history is that of the\r\nPaper Nautilus, with which so much poetry is associated. We have all\r\nbeen accustomed from childhood to Pope’s well-known lines beginning--\r\n\r\n    “Learn of the little Nautilus to sail,”\r\n\r\nand some of us may be acquainted with those graceful verses of James\r\nMontgomery, in his “Pelican Island:”--\r\n\r\n    “Light as a flake of foam upon the wind,\r\n     Keel upward, from the deep emerged a shell,\r\n     Shaped like the moon ere half her horn is filled.\r\n     Fraught with young life it righted as it rose,\r\n     And moved at will along the yielding water.\r\n     The native pilot of this little bark\r\n     Put out a tier of oars on either side,\r\n     Spread to the wafting breeze a two-fold sail,\r\n     And mounted up and glided down the billow\r\n     In happy freedom, pleased to feel the air,\r\n     And wander in the luxury of light.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     It closed, sank, dwindled to a point, then nothing,\r\n     While the last bubble crowned the dimpling eddy\r\n     Through which mine eye still giddily pursued it.”\r\n\r\nSo deeply ingrained is the poetical notion of the sailing powers\r\nattributed to the nautilus, that many people are quite incredulous when\r\nthey are told that there is just as much likelihood of seeing a mermaid\r\ncurl her hair as of witnessing a nautilus under sail. How the creature\r\nin question does propel itself will be described in the course of the\r\npresent chapter; and the reader will see that although one parallel\r\nbetween Nature and Art in the nautilus does not exist, there are several\r\nothers which until later days have not even been suspected.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, partially true that science does destroy romance. But,\r\nthough she destroys, she creates, and she gives infinitely more than she\r\ntakes away, as is shown in the many late discoveries which have\r\ntransformed the whole system of civilised life. Sometimes, as in the\r\npresent instance, she discovers one analogy while destroying another,\r\nand though she shatters the legend of the sailing nautilus, she produces\r\na marine animal which really does sail, and does not appear to be able\r\nto do anything else. This is the VELELLA, a figure of which, taken from\r\na specimen in my collection, is given in the illustration, and drawn of\r\nthe natural size.\r\n\r\nIt is one of that vast army of marine creatures known familiarly by the\r\nname of “jelly-fishes,” just as lobsters, crabs, shrimps, oysters,\r\nwhelks, periwinkles, and the like, are lumped together under the title\r\nof “shell-fish.” As a rule, these creatures are soft, gelatinous, and,\r\nin fact, are very little more than sea-water entangled in the finest\r\nimaginable mesh-work of animal matter; so fine, indeed, that scarcely\r\nany definite organs can be discovered. The Velella, however, is\r\nremarkable for having a sort of skeleton, if it may be so called,\r\nconsisting of two very thin and horny plates, disposed, as shown in the\r\nillustration, so as to form an exact imitation (or perhaps I should say\r\na precursor) of a raft propelled by a sail. Indeed, the Latin name\r\nVelella signifies a little sail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VELELLA (NATURAL SIZE).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAILING RAFT.]\r\n\r\nHow well deserved is the name may be seen by the following graphic\r\naccount of a Velella fleet sent to me by a lady who takes great interest\r\nin practical zoology:--\r\n\r\n“The specimens which I send came from Tenby, a very rough sea having\r\ndriven a large living fleet of them on that coast.\r\n\r\n“When in life, they are semi-transparent, and radiant in many\r\nrainbow-tinted colours. They came floating towards me in all their\r\nfragile beauty on the rough sea waves. I succeeded in capturing some of\r\nthem, and preserved the only portion available for my collection.\r\n\r\n“They are extremely tender, and by no means with which I am acquainted\r\ncan be preserved more than these skeleton-like cartilaginous plates.\r\nThey soon dissolve in either spirits of wine or water, and lose every\r\nvestige of their shape and substance. The upright, thin, pellucid plate\r\nhas the appearance of a fairy-like miniature sail, and apparently acted\r\nas such when the creature was floating with its long and many-tinted\r\ntentacles pendent from its lower surface.\r\n\r\n“Although widely distributed, they are seldom seen on our own coast,\r\nalthough sometimes driven there from the warmer regions by stress of\r\nwind and waves.\r\n\r\n“These little creatures had never before been seen at Tenby, but when I\r\nasked a native bathing-woman whether she knew their name, she\r\nimmediately replied, ‘Sea-butterflies.’ Although the name was evidently\r\nof her own invention, it was most appropriate and poetical. I have\r\nalways found the Welsh people abound more than any other nation in\r\npretty and characteristic synonyms.”[A]\r\n\r\n [A] By sailors the Velella is popularly known by the name of\r\n “Sally-man;” _i.e._ Sallee-man.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a letter in which I asked the writer for some further\r\ninformation concerning the Velella, sending also an outline sketch of\r\nthe animal, which I asked the writer to fill in with the proper colours,\r\nI received the following reply:--\r\n\r\n“I will do my best to answer your questions, and to give you what\r\ninformation I can concerning the creatures.\r\n\r\n“When seen at Tenby, they were all floating on the surface of the sea,\r\nthe tentacles only being submerged. My specimens floated for a very\r\nshort time after capture, death following so quickly that I was obliged\r\nto set to work at once with camel’s-hair brush and penknife to take away\r\nthe gelatinous part. Indeed, decomposition took place so rapidly, that\r\nVelellas and myself were simultaneously threatened with extermination.\r\n\r\n“Both raft and sail were equally enveloped in a soft, gelatinous\r\ncovering, certainly not more than the sixteenth of an inch in thickness,\r\nexcept under the centre of the raft, where it became slightly thicker.\r\nThe covering of the sail was exceedingly thin, and like a transparent\r\nand almost invisible soft skin. The sail is very firmly attached to the\r\nraft, as they did not separate when decomposition began.\r\n\r\n“The tentacles were entirely composed of the same soft, jelly-like\r\nsubstance as that of the envelope, and every part was iridescent in a\r\nsort of vapoury transparent cloud of many-tinted colours, blue and pale\r\ncrimson predominating. I have filled up to the best of my memory the\r\nlittle sketch, and only wish you could have seen the Velellas as I did,\r\nin their full life and beauty.”\r\n\r\nTwo of the specimens here mentioned are in my collection, and beautiful\r\nlittle things they are. The two plates are not thicker than ordinary\r\nsilver paper, but are wonderfully strong, tough, and elastic. The oval\r\nhorizontal plate, or raft, if it may be so called, is strengthened by\r\nbeing corrugated in concentric lines, and having a multitude of very\r\nfine ribs radiating from the centre to the circumference. It is slightly\r\nthickened on the edges, evidently for the attachment of the tentacles.\r\n\r\nThe perpendicular plate, or sail, does not occupy the larger diameter of\r\nthe raft, but stretches across it diagonally from edge to edge, rising\r\nhighest in the centre and diminishing towards the edges, so that it\r\npresents an outline singularly like that of a lateen sail. It is rather\r\ncurious that the magnifying glass gives but little, if any, assistance\r\nto the observer, the naked eye answering every purpose. Even the\r\nmicroscope is useless, detecting no peculiarity of structure. I tried it\r\nwith the polariscope, scarcely expecting, but rather hoping, to find\r\nthat it was sensitive to polarised light. But no such result took place,\r\nthe Velella being quite unaffected by it.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding illustration is a sketch of a raft to which a sail is\r\nattached. Such rafts as this are in use in many parts of the world, the\r\nsail saving manual labour, and the large steering oar answering the\r\ndouble purpose of keel and rudder. In the Velella, the tentacles, though\r\nthey may not act in the latter capacity, certainly do act in that of the\r\nformer, and serve to prevent the little creature from being capsized in\r\na gale of wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOAT.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the first idea of locomotion in the water,\r\nindependently of swimming, was the raft; nor is it difficult to trace\r\nthe gradual development of the raft into a Boat. The development of the\r\nKruman’s canoe into the _Great Eastern_, or a modern ironclad vessel, is\r\nsimply a matter of time.\r\n\r\nIt is tolerably evident that the first raft was nothing more than a\r\ntree-trunk. Finding that the single trunk was apt to turn over with the\r\nweight of the occupant, the next move was evidently to lash two trunks\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\nNext would come the great advance of putting the trunks at some distance\r\napart, and connecting them with cross-bars. This plan would obviate even\r\nthe chance of the upsetting of the raft, and it still survives in that\r\ncurious mixture of the raft and canoe, the outrigger boat of the\r\nPolynesians, which no gale of wind can upset. It may be torn to pieces\r\nby the storm, but nothing can capsize it as long as it holds together.\r\n\r\nLaying a number of smaller logs or branches upon the bars which connect\r\nthe larger logs is an evident mode of forming a continuous platform, and\r\nthus the raft is completed. It would not be long before the superior\r\nbuoyancy of a hollow over a solid log would be discovered, and so, when\r\nthe savage could not find a log ready hollowed to his hand, he would\r\nhollow one for himself, mostly using fire in lieu of tools. The progress\r\nfrom a hollowed log, or “dug-out,” as it is popularly called, to the\r\nbark canoe, and then the built boat, naturally followed, the boats\r\nincreasing in size until they were developed into ships.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is a slight sketch of the gradual construction of the Boat,\r\nbased, though perhaps ignorantly, on the theory of displacement. Now,\r\nlet us ask ourselves whether, in creation, there are any natural boats\r\nwhich existed before man came upon the earth, and from which he might\r\nhave taken the idea if he had been able to reason on the subject. The\r\nPaper Nautilus is, of course, the first example that comes before the\r\nmind; but although, as we have seen, the delicate shell of the nautilus\r\nis not used as a boat, and its sailing and rowing powers are alike\r\nfabulous, there is, as is the case with most fables, a substratum of\r\ntruth, and there are aquatic molluscs which form themselves into boats,\r\nalthough they do not propel themselves with sails or oars.\r\n\r\nMany species of molluscs possess this art, but we will select one as an\r\nexample of them all, because it is very plentiful in our own country,\r\nand may be found in almost any number. It is the common WATER-SNAIL\r\n(_Limnæa stagnalis_), which abounds in our streams where the current is\r\nnot very strong. Even in tolerably swift streams the Limnæa may be found\r\nplentifully in any bay or sudden curve where a reverse current is\r\ngenerated, and therefore the force of the stream is partially\r\nneutralised. These molluscs absolutely swarm in the Cherwell, and in the\r\nmultitudinous ditches which drain the flat country about Oxford into\r\nthat river as well as the Isis.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the Gasteropods, the Water-snail can crawl over the stones\r\nor aquatic vegetation, just as the common garden snail or slug does on\r\nland. But it has another mode of progression, which it very often\r\nemploys in warm weather. It ascends to the surface of the water,\r\nreverses its position so that the shell is downward, spreads out the\r\nfoot as widely as possible, and then contracts it in the centre, so as\r\nto form it into a shallow boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GNAT-EGG BOAT AND THREE EGGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “DUG-OUT” BOAT OF VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA-ANEMONE ACTING AS BOAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER-SNAIL ACTING AS BOAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRCH-BARK CANOE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUPA SKIN OF GNAT ACTING AS BOAT.]\r\n\r\nThe carrying capacity of this boat is necessarily small, but as the\r\nshell and nearly the whole of the animal are submerged, and therefore\r\nmostly sustained by the water, a very small amount of flotative power is\r\nsufficient for the purpose. Sometimes, on a fine day, whole fleets of\r\nthese natural boats may be seen floating down the stream, thus obtaining\r\na change of locality without any personal exertion.\r\n\r\nIn perfectly still water, where no current can waft the Limnæa on its\r\neasy voyage, it still is able to convey itself from one place to\r\nanother. By means of extending and contracting the foot, it actually\r\ncontrives to crawl along the surface of the water almost as readily as\r\nif it were upon the under side of some solid body, and, although its\r\nprogress is slow, it is very steady. Another very common British\r\nwater-snail, the Pouch-shell (_Physa fontinalis_), has almost exactly\r\nthe same habits. Reference will be made to the Pouch-shell on another\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThe capacity for converting the body into a boat is not confined to the\r\nmolluscs, but is shared by many other animals. Take, for example, the\r\nwell-known marine animals, called popularly SEA-ANEMONES. As they appear\r\nwhen planted on the rocks, they look as incapable of motion as the\r\nflowers whose names they bear. Yet, by means of the flattened base,\r\nwhich they use just as a snail uses its feet, they can manage to glide\r\nalong the rocks in any direction, though very slowly.\r\n\r\nThe base is capable of extension and contraction, and by elongating one\r\nside of it, fixing the elongated portion, and then raising the remainder\r\nof the base towards it, the animal makes practically a series of very\r\nslow steps. This mode of progression may often be seen in operation on\r\nthe glass front of an aquarium.\r\n\r\nThe same property of expansion and contraction enables the Sea-anemones\r\nto convert their bodies into boats, and float on the surface of the\r\nwater. When one of these animals wishes to swim, it ascends the object\r\nto which it is clinging--say the glass of the aquarium--until it has\r\nreached the air. It then very slowly, and bit by bit, detaches the upper\r\npart of the base from the glass, allowing itself to hang with its\r\ntentacles downward. These, by the way, are almost wholly withdrawn when\r\nthe animal is engaged in this business. By degrees the whole of the base\r\nis detached from the glass except a very tiny portion of the edge. The\r\nbase is next contracted in the middle into the form of a shallow cup,\r\nand, when this is done, the last hold of the glass is released, and the\r\nanimal floats away, supported by its hollowed base.\r\n\r\nEntomologists are familiar with the following facts, and were this work\r\naddressed to them alone, a simple mention of the insect would be\r\nsufficient. But as this work is intended for the general public, it will\r\nbe necessary to give a description, though a brief one, of the wonderful\r\nmanner in which an insect, which we are apt to think is only too common,\r\nplays the part of a boat at its entrance to life and just before its\r\ndeparture from this world, not to mention its intermediate state, to\r\nwhich reference will be made under another heading.\r\n\r\nThe insect in question is the common GNAT (_Culex pipiens_), which makes\r\nsuch ravages upon those who are afflicted, like myself, with delicate\r\nskins, and can have a limb rendered useless for days by a single\r\ngnat-bite.\r\n\r\nIn this insect, the beginning and the end of life are so closely\r\ninterwoven, that it is not easy to determine which has the prior claim\r\nto description, but we will begin with the egg.\r\n\r\nWith very few exceptions, such as the Earwig, which watches over its\r\neggs and young like a hen over her nest and chickens, the insects merely\r\ndeposit their eggs upon or close to the food of the future young, and\r\nleave them to their fate. The eggs of the Gnat, however, require\r\ndifferent treatment. The young larvæ, when hatched, immediately pass\r\ninto the water in which they have to live, and yet the eggs are so\r\nconstituted that they need the warmth of the sun in order to hatch them.\r\nThe machinery by which both these objects are attained is singularly\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the egg very much resembles that of a common ninepin, and\r\nthe structure is such that it must be kept upright, so that the top\r\nshall be exposed to the air and sun, and the bottom be immersed in the\r\nwater. It would be almost impossible that these conditions should be\r\nattained if the eggs were either dropped separately into the water or\r\nfixed to aquatic plants, as is the case with many creatures whose eggs\r\nare hatched solely in or on the water.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with many insects, each egg when laid is enveloped with a\r\nslight coating of a glutinous character, so that they adhere together.\r\nAnd, in the case of the Gnat, this material is insoluble in water, and\r\nhardens almost immediately after the egg is deposited. Taking advantage\r\nof these peculiarities, the female Gnat places herself on the edge of a\r\nfloating leaf or similar object, so that her long and slender hind-legs\r\nrest on the water. In some mysterious way, the eggs, as they are\r\nsuccessively produced, are passed along the hind-legs, and are arranged\r\nside by side in such a manner that they are formed into the figure of a\r\nboat, being fixed to each other by the glutinous substance which has\r\nalready been mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable fact, which assists in strengthening the theory\r\non which this book is written, that the lines of the best modern\r\nlife-boats are almost identical with those of the Gnat-boat, and that\r\nboth possess the power of righting themselves if capsized. In all trials\r\nof a new life-boat, one of the most important is that which tests her\r\ncapability of self-righting; and any one who has witnessed such\r\nexperiments, and has tried to upset a Gnat-boat, cannot but be struck\r\nwith the singular similitude between the boat made by the hand of man\r\nand that constructed by the legs of an insect, without even the aid of\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nPush the Gnat-boat under water, and it shoots to the surface like a\r\ncork, righting itself as it rises. Pour water on it, and exactly the\r\nsame result occurs, so that nothing can prevent it from floating. Then,\r\nwhen the warm air has done its work in hatching the enclosed young, a\r\nlittle trap-door opens at the bottom of the egg, lets the young larvæ\r\ninto the water, and away they swim.\r\n\r\nNow we come to another phase of existence in which the Gnat forms a\r\nboat. Every one knows the little active Gnat larvæ, with their large\r\nheads and slender bodies, much like tadpoles in miniature. When they\r\nhave reached their full growth, and assume the pupal form, their shape\r\nis much changed. The fore part of the body is still more enlarged, as it\r\nhas to contain the wings and legs, which have so great a proportion to\r\nthe body of the perfect Gnat. And, instead of floating with its head\r\ndownwards, and breathing through its tail as it did when a larva, it now\r\nfloats with the head uppermost, and breathes through two little tubes.\r\n\r\nEven in its former state the creature had something almost grotesque in\r\nits aspect, the head, when magnified, looking almost as like a human\r\nface as does that of a skate. But in its pupal state it looks as if it\r\nhad put on a large comical mask much too large for it, very much like\r\nthose paper masks which are enclosed in crackers, and have to be worn\r\nby those who draw them.\r\n\r\nIn process of time the pupa changes to a perfect Gnat within this shelly\r\ncase, able to move, but unable to eat. The body shrinks in size, and the\r\nwings and legs are formed, both being pressed closely to the body. When\r\nthe Gnat is fully developed, the pupal skin splits along the back, and\r\nopens out into a curiously boat-like shape, the front, which contains\r\nthe heavier part of the insect, being much the largest, and consequently\r\nbeing able to bear the greatest weight.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the Gnat draws itself out of the split pupal skin, resting\r\nits legs on it as fast as they are released. It then shakes out its\r\nwings to dry, and finally takes to the air.\r\n\r\nIt is a really wonderful fact that the insect which, for three stages in\r\nlife--namely, an egg, larva, and pupa--lived in the water, should in the\r\nfourth not only be incapable of aquatic life, but should employ its old\r\nskin to protect it from that very element in which it was living only a\r\nminute or two before.\r\n\r\nShould the reader wish to examine for himself either the egg or skin\r\nboat of the Gnat, he can easily procure them by searching any quiet\r\npond, or even an uncovered water-butt. They are, of course, very small,\r\naveraging about the tenth of an inch in length, and are nearly always to\r\nbe found close to the side either of pond or tub, being drawn there by\r\nthe power of attraction.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that there are other dipterous insects belonging to\r\nthe genus Stratiomys, which undergo their metamorphosis in a very\r\nsimilar fashion. In these insects, the larva breathes through the tail,\r\nand when it attains its pupal condition, the actual insect is very much\r\nsmaller than the pupal skin, only occupying the anterior and enlarged\r\npart. Indeed, the difference of size is so great, that several\r\nentomologists believed the future Stratiomys to be but a parasite on the\r\noriginal larva. The beautiful Chameleon-fly (_Stratiomys chamæleon_) is\r\na familiar example of these insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUTICAL.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE OAR, THE PADDLE, AND THE SCREW.\r\n\r\n     Propulsion by the Oar.--Parallels in the Insect World.--The\r\n     “Water-boatman.”--Its Boat-like Shape.--The Oar-like Legs.--Exact\r\n     mechanical Analogy between the Legs of the Insect and the Oars of\r\n     the human Rower.--“Feathering” Oars in Nature and Art.--The\r\n     Water-boatman and the Water-beetles.--The Feet of the Swan, Goose,\r\n     and other aquatic Birds.--The Cydippe, or Beroë.--The\r\n     Self-feathering Paddle-wheel.--Indirect Force.--The Wedge, Screw,\r\n     and Inclined Plane.--“Sculling” a Boat.--The “Tanka” Girls of\r\n     China.--Mechanical Principle of the Screw, and its Adaptation to\r\n     Vessels.--Gradual Development of the Nautical Screw.--Mechanical\r\n     Principle of the Tail of the Fish, the Otter, and the sinuous Body\r\n     of the Eel and Lampern.--The Coracle and the Whirlwig-beetle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boat naturally reminds us of the Boatman. In the two gnat-boats\r\nwhich have been described there is no propelling power used or needed,\r\nthe little vessel floating about at random, and its only object being to\r\nkeep afloat. But there are many cases where the propelling power is\r\nabsolutely essential, and where its absence would mean death, as much as\r\nit would to a ship which was becalmed in mid ocean without any means of\r\nprogress or escape. There are, for example, hundreds of creatures,\r\nbelonging to every order of animals, which are absolutely dependent for\r\ntheir very existence on their power of propulsion, and I believe that\r\nthere is not a single mode of aquatic progression employed by man which\r\nhas not been previously carried out in the animal world. There are so\r\nmany examples of this fact that I am obliged to select a very few\r\ntypical instances in proof of the assertion.\r\n\r\nTaking the Oar as the natural type of progression in the water, we have\r\nin the insect world numerous examples of the very same principle on\r\nwhich our modern boats are propelled. And it is worthy of notice, that\r\nthe greater the improvement in rowing, the nearer do we approach the\r\noriginal insect model.\r\n\r\nThe first which we shall notice is the insect which, from its singular\r\nresemblance to a boat propelled by a pair of oars, has received the\r\npopular name of WATER-BOATMAN. Its scientific name is _Notonecta\r\nglauca_, the meaning of which we shall presently see. It belongs to the\r\norder of Heteroptera, and is one of a numerous group, all bearing some\r\nresemblance to each other in form, and being almost identical in habits.\r\nThough they can fly well, and walk tolerably, they pass the greater part\r\nof their existence in the water, in which element they find their food.\r\n\r\nPredacious to a high degree, and armed with powerful weapons of offence,\r\nit is one of the pirates of the fresh water, and may be found in almost\r\nevery pond and stream, plying its deadly vocation.\r\n\r\nIts large and powerful wings seem only to be employed in carrying it\r\nfrom one piece of water to another, while its first and second pairs of\r\nlegs are hardly ever used at all for progression. The last pair of legs\r\nare of very great length, and furnished at their tips with a curiously\r\nconstructed fringe of stiff hairs. The body is shaped in a manner that\r\ngreatly resembles a boat turned upside down, the edge of the elytra\r\nforming a sort of ridge very much like the keel of the boat.\r\n\r\nWhen the creature is engaged in swimming, it turns itself on its back,\r\nso as to bring the keel downwards, and to be able to cut the water with\r\nthe sharp edge. From this habit it has derived the name of Notonecta,\r\nwhich signifies an animal which swims on its back. The first and second\r\npairs of legs are clasped to the body, and the last pair are stretched\r\nout as shown in the illustration, not only looking like oars, but being\r\nactually used as oars.\r\n\r\nNow, I wish especially to call the reader’s attention to the curiously\r\nexact parallel between the water-boatman and the human oarsman. As the\r\nreader may probably know, the oar is a lever of the second order, _i.e._\r\nthe power comes first, then the weight, and then the fulcrum. The arm of\r\nthe rower furnishes the power, the boat is the weight to be moved, and\r\nthe water is the fulcrum against which the lever acts.\r\n\r\nI have more than once heard objections to this definition, the objectors\r\nsaying that the water was a yielding substance, and therefore could not\r\nbe the fulcrum. This objection, however, was easily refuted by taking a\r\nboat up a narrow creek, and rowing with the oar-blades resting on the\r\nshore, and not in the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OAR-LEG OF WATER-BOATMAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OAR OF BOAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER-BOATMAN ROWING ITSELF.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OARSMAN ROWING.]\r\n\r\nNow, the swimming legs of the water-boatman are exact analogues of the\r\noars of a human rower. The internal muscles at the juncture of the leg\r\nwith the body supply the place of the rower’s arms, the leg itself takes\r\nthe office of the oar, and the body of the insect is the weight to be\r\nmoved, and the water supplies the fulcrum. Even the broad blade at the\r\nend of the oar is anticipated by the fringe of bristles at the end of\r\nthe leg, and its sharpened edge by the shape of the insect’s limb.\r\n\r\nBesides these resemblances, there is another which is worthy of notice.\r\nAll rowers know that one of their first lessons is to “feather” their\r\noars, _i.e._ to turn the blade edgewise as soon as it leaves the water.\r\nNothing looks more awkward than for a boatman to row without feathering.\r\n(We all must remember the eulogy on the “Jolly Young Waterman,” who\r\n“feathered his oars with skill and dexterity.”) In the first place, he\r\nmust lift his oar very high out of the water, and, in the second, he\r\nwill be impeded by any wind that happens to come against the blades.\r\n\r\nThe Water-boatman, however, does not lift its legs out of the water\r\nafter every stroke, as a human boatman does, and therefore it has no\r\nneed to feather in the same way. But there is even greater need for a\r\nfeathering of some kind in the insect’s leg, on account of the greater\r\nresistance offered by water than by air, and this feathering is effected\r\nby the arrangement of the blade-bristles, which spread themselves\r\nagainst the water as the stroke is made, and collapse afterwards, so as\r\nto give as little resistance as possible when the stroke is completed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Art we have invented many similar contrivances, but I believe that\r\nthere is not one in which we have not been anticipated by Nature.\r\nPutting aside the insect which has just been described, we have the\r\nwhole tribe of water-beetles, in which the same principle is carried out\r\nin an almost identical manner. In the accompanying illustration, the\r\noar, the rower, and the boat are placed above one another, and next to\r\nthem are seen one of the oar-legs of the water-boatman and the insect as\r\nit appears when swimming on its back.\r\n\r\nThen, there is the foot of the duck, goose, swan, and various other\r\naquatic birds, in which the foot presents a broad blade as it strikes\r\nagainst the water, and a narrow edge as it recovers from the stroke.\r\nSome years ago, a steam yacht was built and propelled by feet made on\r\nthe model of those of the swan. She was a very pretty vessel, but art\r\ncould not equal nature, and at present the swan-foot propeller, however\r\nperfect in theory, has not succeeded in action. Perhaps, if some\r\nnautical engineer were to take it in hand, he would procure the desired\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly similar is the mode of propulsion employed by the\r\nlobster, the prawns and shrimps, their tails expanding widely into a\r\nfan-like shape as they strike against the water, and then collapsing\r\nwhen the stroke is withdrawn, so as to allow them to pass through the\r\nwater with the least possible resistance.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is to be seen in the lively little Acaleph, for which\r\nthere is unfortunately no popular name, and which we must therefore call\r\nby its scientific title of CYDIPPE, or Beroë, these names being almost\r\nindifferently used. When full grown, it is about as large as an acorn,\r\nand very much of the same shape. It is as transparent as if made of\r\nglass, and, when in the water, is only visible to practised eyes.\r\n\r\n_En passant_, I may remark that the familiar term of “water,” when\r\napplied to diamonds, is owing to their appearance when placed in\r\ndistilled water. Those which can be at once seen are called stones of\r\nthe second water. Those which cannot be seen, because their refractive\r\npowers are equal to those of the water, are called “diamonds of the\r\nfirst water,” and are very much more valuable than the others.\r\n\r\nAs the Cydippe is, in fact, little more than sea-water, entangled in\r\nthe slightest imaginable and most transparent tissue of animal fibre, it\r\nis evident that the water and the Cydippe must be of almost equal\r\nrefracting power, and that therefore the acaleph must be as invisible as\r\ndiamonds of the “first water.” Indeed, I have often had specimens in a\r\nglass jar which were absolutely invisible to persons to whom I wished to\r\nshow them.\r\n\r\nBut an experienced eye detects the creature at once. Along its body, at\r\nequal distances, are eight narrow bands, over which the colours of the\r\nrainbow are, though very faint, perpetually rippling. This appearance is\r\ncaused by the machinery which impels the body, and which seems never to\r\ncease. Each of these bands is composed of a vast number of tiny flaps,\r\nwhich move up and down in regular succession, so as to cause the light\r\nto play on their surfaces. And, as they move as if set on hinges, they\r\nof course offer no resistance to the water after their stroke is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYDIPPE AND PADDLES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRAWN SWIMMING.\r\n\r\nFEET of DUCK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SELF-FEATHERING PADDLE-WHEEL.]\r\n\r\nNow let us compare these works of nature with those of art. We have\r\nalready seen the parallels of the oar, and we now come to those of the\r\npaddle-wheel. When paddle-steamers were first invented, the blades were\r\nfixed and projected from the wheel, as if they had been continuations of\r\nits spokes. It was found, however, that a great waste of power, together\r\nwith much inconvenience, was caused by this arrangement. Not only was a\r\nconsiderable weight of water raised by each blade after it passed the\r\nmiddle of its stroke, but the steam power was given nearly as much to\r\nlifting and shaking the vessel as to propulsion.\r\n\r\nA new kind of paddle-wheel was then invented, in which the blades were\r\ningeniously jointed to the wheel, so that they presented their flat\r\nsurfaces to the water while propelling, and their edges when the stroke\r\nwas over. This, which is known by the name of the “Self-feathering\r\nPaddle-wheel,” was thought to be a very clever invention, and so it was;\r\nbut not even the inventors were likely to have known that if they had\r\nonly looked into the book of Nature, they might have found plenty of\r\nself-feathering paddle-wheels, beside the few which my limited space\r\nenables me to give.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will look at the illustration, he will see that on one\r\nside is represented the self-feathering paddle-wheel of Art, with its\r\ningenious arrangement of rods and hinges. On the other side there comes,\r\nfirst, the common Prawn, shown with its tail expanded in the middle of\r\nits stroke.\r\n\r\nJust below it is a Cydippe of its ordinary size, showing the\r\npaddle-bands, one of which is drawn at the side much magnified, so as to\r\nshow the arrangement of the little paddles. As to the tentacles which\r\ntrail from the body, we shall treat of them when we come to our next\r\ndivision of the subject of the work.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is a representation of the self-feathering feet of the\r\nDuck, the left foot expanded in striking the water, and the right closed\r\nso as to offer no resistance when drawn forward for another stroke. The\r\nswan’s foot shows this action even more beautifully than does that of\r\nthe duck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to another mode of propulsion, namely, that which is not due\r\nto direct pressure of a more or less flat body against the water, but to\r\nthe indirect principle of the screw, wedge, or inclined plane.\r\n\r\nSpace being valuable, I will only take two instances, namely, the\r\nwell-known mode of propelling a boat by a single oar working in a groove\r\nor rowlock in the middle of the stern, and the ordinary screw of modern\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\nMost of my readers must have seen a sailor in the act of “sculling” a\r\nboat. A tolerably deep notch is sunk in the centre of the stern, and the\r\noar is laid in it, as shown in the central illustration, on the\r\nright-hand side. The sailor then takes the handle of the oar, and works\r\nit regularly backwards and forwards, without taking the blade out of the\r\nwater. The boat at once begins to move forward, and, when the oar is\r\nurged by a strong and experienced man, can be propelled with wonderful\r\nspeed. The well-known “Tanka” boat-girls of China never think of using\r\ntwo oars, a single oar in the stern being all-sufficient for the rapid\r\nand intricate evolutions required in their business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAIL OF FISH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCREW OF STEAMER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAIL OF OTTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “SCULLING” A BOAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAIL OF SEAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACTION OF RUDDER.]\r\n\r\nThe mechanical process which is here employed is nothing more than that\r\nof the inclined plane, or rather, the wedge, the oar-blade forming the\r\nwedge, and the force being directed against the stern of the boat, and\r\nso driving it through the water.\r\n\r\nThe Rudder affords another example of a similar force, although it is\r\nused more for directing than propelling a vessel. Still, just as the\r\nscull is used not only for propelling, but for steering the boat, the\r\nrudder, when moved steadily backwards and forwards, can be used for\r\npropulsion as well as steerage. In the absence of oars, this property is\r\nmost useful, as I can practically testify.\r\n\r\nSo different in appearance are the screw and the inclined plane, that\r\nvery few people would realise the fact that the screw is nothing but an\r\ninclined plane wound round a cylinder, or rather, is a circular inclined\r\nplane. The ordinary corkscrew is a good example of this principle, the\r\ncylinder being but an imaginary one.\r\n\r\nNow, if the screw be turned round, it is evident that force is applied\r\njust on the principle of the wedge, and this principle is well shown in\r\nthe various screw-presses, of which the common linen-press is a familiar\r\nexample, as was the original printing-press, which still survives as a\r\ntoy for children.\r\n\r\nWe all know the enormous force exerted by screws when working in wood,\r\nand how, when the screw-driver is turned in the reverse direction, the\r\ninstrument is forced backwards, though the operator is leaning against\r\nit with all his weight. In fact, a comparatively small screw, if working\r\nin hard wood or metal, so that the threads could not break, could lift a\r\nheavy man.\r\n\r\nSubstitute water for wood or metal, and the result would be the same in\r\nprinciple, though the resistance would be less. As the loss of power by\r\nfriction would prevent a large vessel from being propelled by a stern\r\noar moved like a scull, the idea was invented of applying the same kind\r\nof power by a large screw, which should project into the water from the\r\nstern of the vessel. This modification, moreover, would have the\r\nadvantage of forcing the vessel forward when the screw was turned from\r\nleft to right, and drawing it back when turned in the opposite\r\ndirection, whereas the sculling oar would only drive it forward.\r\n\r\nThe principle was right enough, but there was at first a great\r\ndifficulty in carrying it out. Firstly, several turns of a large screw\r\nwere used, and were found to need power inadequate to the effect. Then\r\nthe screw was reduced to four separate blades, and now only two are\r\nused, as shown in the illustration, these saving friction, being equally\r\npowerful for propulsion, and running less risk of fouling by rigging\r\nblown overboard or other floating substances.\r\n\r\nSo much for Art. Now for the same principle as shown in Nature, of which\r\nI can take but a very few instances.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious example is that of the Fish-tail, which any\r\none may observe by watching ordinary gold fish in a bowl. Their\r\nprogression is entirely accomplished by the movement of the tail from\r\nside to side, exactly like that of the sculling oar, and moreover, like\r\nthe oar, the tail acts as rudder as well as propeller.\r\n\r\nThe force with which this instrument can be used may be estimated by any\r\none who is an angler, and knows the lightning-like rush of a hooked\r\ntrout, or who has seen the wonderful spring with which a salmon shoots\r\nclear out of the water, and leaps up a fall several feet in height. This\r\nis not done, as many writers state, by bending the body into a bow-like\r\nform, and then suddenly straightening it, but by the projectile force\r\nwhich is gained by moving the tail backwards and forwards as a sculler\r\nmoves his oar.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers have seen the wonderful speed, ease, and\r\ngrace with which an Otter propels itself through the water. As the otter\r\nfeeds on fish, and can capture even the salmon itself, its powers of\r\nlocomotion must be very great indeed. And these are obtained entirely by\r\nmeans of the tail, which is long, thick, and muscular, and can be swept\r\nfrom side to side with enormous force, considering the size of the\r\nanimal. The legs have little or nothing to do with the act of swimming.\r\nThe fore-legs are pressed closely against the body, and the hind-legs\r\nagainst each other. The latter act occasionally as assistants in\r\nsteering, but that is all.\r\n\r\nThen there are the various Seals, whose hind-legs, flattened and pressed\r\ntogether, act exactly like the tail of the fish, that of the otter, the\r\noar of the sculler, or the screw of the steamer. Also, the eel, when\r\nswimming, uses exactly the same means, its lithe body forming a\r\nsuccession of inclined planes; so does the snake, and so does the pretty\r\nlittle lampern, which is so common in several of our rivers, and so\r\ntotally absent from others.\r\n\r\nI can only now give a short description of the woodcut which illustrates\r\nthese points.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand Art is shown by the screw-blades of the modern\r\nsteamer. In the middle is the ordinary mode of sculling a boat by an oar\r\nin the stern, and below it is the rudder, which, like the sculling oar,\r\nmay be used either for propulsion or direction.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand we have three examples of the same mechanical powers\r\nas shown in Nature. The uppermost figure represents a fish as in the act\r\nof swimming, the dotted lines showing the movement of its tail, and the\r\nprinciple of the wedge. In the middle is an otter, just preparing to\r\nenter the water, and below is a seal, both of them showing the identity\r\nof mechanism between themselves and the art of man. I need not say that\r\nthe mechanism of art is only a feeble copy of that of nature, but\r\nnothing more could be expected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHILE we are on this subject I may as well mention two more applications\r\nof the screw principle. The first is the windmill, the sails of which\r\nare constructed on exactly the same principle as the blades of the\r\nnautical screw. Only, as they are pressed by the wind, and the mill\r\ncannot move, they are forced to revolve by the pressure of the wind,\r\njust as the screw of a steamer revolves when the vessel is being towed,\r\nand the screw left at liberty.\r\n\r\nMoreover, just as the modern screws have only two blades, so, many\r\nmodern windmills have only two sails, the expense and friction being\r\nlessened, and the power not injured.\r\n\r\nAgain: some years ago there was a very fashionable toy called the aërial\r\ntop. It was practically nothing but a windmill in miniature, rapidly\r\nturned by a string, after the manner of a humming-top. The edges of the\r\nsails being turned downwards, the instrument naturally screwed itself\r\ninto the air to a height equivalent to the velocity of the motion.\r\n\r\nA similar idea has been mooted with regard to the guidance of balloons,\r\nor even to aërial voyaging without the assistance of gas, but at present\r\nthe weight of the needful machinery has proved to be in excess of the\r\nrequired lifting power.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the application of the inclined plane, wedge, or screw as a\r\nmotive power, is so wide a subject that I must, with much reluctance,\r\nclose it with these few and obvious examples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is worth while, by the way, to remark how curiously similar are such\r\nparallels. I have already mentioned the very evident resemblance between\r\nthe water-boatman, the water-beetles, and the human rower, the body of\r\nthe insect being shaped very much like the form of the modern boat. I\r\nmust now draw the attention of the reader to the similitude between the\r\nvery primitive boat known by the name of Coracle, and the common\r\nWhirlwig-beetle (_Gyrinus natator_), which may be found in nearly every\r\npuddle. The shape of the insect is almost identical with that of the\r\nboat, and the paddle of the coracle is an almost exact imitation of the\r\nswimming legs of the whirlwig. And, as if to make the resemblance\r\ncloser, many coraclers, instead of using a single paddle with two broad\r\nends, employ two short paddles, shaped very much like battledores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHIRLWIG BEETLE AND PADDLES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORACLE AND PADDLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUTICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSUBSIDIARY APPLIANCES.--PART I.\r\n\r\n     General Sketch of the Subject.--The Mast of Wood and Iron.--Analogy\r\n     between the Iron Mast and the Porcupine Quill.--The Iron Yard and\r\n     its Shape prefigured by the same Quill.--Beams of the\r\n     Steam-engine.--Principle of the Hollow Tube in place of the Solid\r\n     Bar.--Quills and Bones of Birds.--Wheat Straws and\r\n     Bamboos.--Structure of the Boat.--The Coracle, the Esquimaux Boat,\r\n     and the Bark Canoe.--Framework of the Ship and Skeleton of the\r\n     Fish.--Compartments of Iron Ship and Skull of Elephant.--The Rush,\r\n     the Cane, and the Sugar-cane.--“Stellate” Tissue and its Varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now treated of the raft, the boat, the ship, and their various\r\nmodes of propulsion and guidance, we come to the subsidiary appliances\r\nto navigation, if they may be so called in lack of a better name.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance is necessarily the mast; and the yards, which\r\nsupport the sails, are naturally the next in order. Then there come the\r\nvarious improvements in the building of vessels; namely, the\r\nsubstitution of planks fastened on a skeleton of beams for a mere\r\nhollowed log, and the subsequent invention of iron vessels with their\r\nnumerous compartments, giving enormous strength and size, with very\r\ngreat comparative lightness.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the various developments of the ropes or cables, by\r\nwhich a vessel is kept in its place when within reach of ground, whether\r\non shore or at the water-bed. Next come the different forms of anchors\r\nwhich fasten a vessel to the bed of the ocean, of grapnels by which she\r\ncan be made fast to the shore, or of “drags,” which at a pinch can\r\nperform either office, and can besides be utilised in searching for and\r\nhauling up objects that are lying at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nNext we come to the boat-hook, which is so useful either as a temporary\r\nanchor, or as a pole by which a boat can be propelled by pushing it\r\nagainst the shore or the bed of the water; and then to the “punt-pole,”\r\nwhich is only used for the latter purpose.\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to the life-belt and life-raft, which are now occupying,\r\nand rightly, so much of the public attention. These subjects will be\r\ntreated in their order in the present chapter, and I hope to be able to\r\nshow the reader that in all these points nature has anticipated art.\r\n\r\nI presume that most, if not all, of my readers are aware of the rapidly\r\nextending use of iron in ship-building, not only in the standing\r\nrigging, but in the material of the vessel. First there came iron\r\n“knees,” _i.e._ the angular pieces of wood which strengthen the\r\njunctions of the timbers. Formerly these were made of oak-branches, and,\r\nas it was not easy to find a bough which was naturally bent at such an\r\nangle as was required for a “knee,” such branches were exceedingly\r\nvaluable. Iron, however, was then employed, and with the best results.\r\nIt was lighter than the wooden knee, was stronger, could be bent at any\r\nangle, and took up much less space.\r\n\r\nBy degrees iron was used more and more, until vessels were wholly made\r\nof that material. Then the masts, and even the yards, were made of iron,\r\nand, strange as it may appear, were found to be lighter as well as\r\nstronger than those made of wood. Of course, the masts and yards were\r\nhollow, and it was found by the engineers that in order to combine\r\nlightness with great strength, the best plan was to run longitudinal\r\nridges along the inside of the tube.\r\n\r\nA section of one of these masts is given at Fig. B, and taken from the\r\ndrawings of one of our largest engineering firms. The reader will see\r\nthat the mast is composed of rather slight material, and that it is\r\nstrengthened by four deep though thin ribs, which run throughout its\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw this mast I was at once struck with the remarkable\r\nresemblance between it and the quill of the Porcupine. These quills, as\r\nall anglers know, are very light, and of extraordinary strength when\r\ncompared with their weight. Indeed, they are so light that they are\r\ninvaluable as penholders to those who are obliged to make much use of\r\ntheir pen. I have used nothing else for a very long time, and the\r\ndrawing of the Porcupine quill which is here given at Fig. A was made\r\nfrom a small piece cut from the top of the penholder which I have used\r\nfor some fifteen years, and with which all my largest and most important\r\nworks were written, including the large “Natural History,” “Homes\r\nwithout Hands,” “Man and Beast,” &c., &c. A portion of the same quill is\r\nalso shown of its real size.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will cut a Porcupine quill at right angles, make a thin\r\nsection of it, and place it under the microscope, or even under an\r\nordinary pocket lens, he will see that the exterior is composed of a\r\nvery thin layer of horny matter, and the interior filled with a vast\r\nnumber of tiny cells, which are formed much on the same plan as the pith\r\nof elder and other plants. The analogies of the pith will be treated in\r\nanother page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPORTION OF PORCUPINE QUILL.              SECTION OF ENGINE BEAM.\r\nCOMPLETE QUILL.                          IRON YARD AND YARD-ARM.\r\nBAMBOO.                                  ENGINE BEAM.\r\nSECTION OF PORCUPINE QUILL MAGNIFIED.    SECTION OF IRON MAST.]\r\n\r\nBut were the quill merely a hollow tube filled with pith, it would be\r\ntoo weak to resist the strain to which it is often liable. Consequently\r\nit is strengthened by a number of internal ribs, composed of the same\r\nhorny material as the outer coat, and arranged in exactly the same way\r\nas those of the mast.\r\n\r\nThere are yet other points in the structure of the Porcupine quill which\r\nmight be imitated with advantage in the mast. In the first place, the\r\ninternal ribs are much more numerous than those of the mast, but they\r\nare very much thinner, and taper away from the base, where the greatest\r\nstrain exists, to the end, where they come to the finest imaginable\r\nedge. This modification of structure enables the outer shell of the\r\nquill to be exceedingly thin and light, and, moreover, gives to the\r\nwhole quill an elasticity which is quite wonderful, considering its\r\nweight and strength.\r\n\r\nThen, in the iron mast the exterior is quite smooth, whereas in the\r\nPorcupine quill it is regularly indented, exactly on the principle of\r\nthe corrugated iron, which combines great strength with great lightness.\r\nAnd I cannot but think that our iron masts might be made both lighter\r\nand stronger if the shell were thinner, the internal ribs made like\r\nthose of the Porcupine quill, and the shell corrugated instead of being\r\nquite smooth. The internal cells of the quill are, of course, not needed\r\nin the mast, as they are intended for nutrition, and not for strength.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEING on this subject, we may take the shape of the Porcupine quill, and\r\ncompare it with that of the ship’s yard. It will be seen that the two\r\nare so exactly similar in form that the outline of one would answer\r\nperfectly well for the other. The only perceptible difference is, that\r\nin the ship’s yard both ends are alike, whereas in the Porcupine quill\r\nthe end which is inserted in the skin is rounded and slightly bent,\r\nwhile the other end is sharply pointed.\r\n\r\nThe principal point to be noticed in the form of both quill and yard is,\r\nthat they become thicker in the centre, that being the spot on which the\r\ngreatest strain comes, and which, in consequence, needs to be stronger\r\nthan any other part. While holding and balancing the pole which Blondin\r\nuses to preserve his balance when walking on the high rope, I was struck\r\nwith the fact that the pole, which is heavily weighted at each end, had\r\nto be strengthened in the middle, exactly on the principle of the\r\nPorcupine quill and the ship’s yard. It could not, of course, be\r\nthickened, as the hands could not grasp it, but it had to be furnished\r\nwith additional strengthening. And the necessity of such strengthening\r\nis evident from the fact that on one occasion the pole did break in the\r\nmiddle, so that any one of less nerve and presence of mind must have\r\nbeen killed.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind, then, that in a rod or pole the centre is the part\r\nwhich most requires to be strengthened, we can see, in cases too\r\nnumerous to mention, how art has followed, though perhaps unconsciously,\r\nin the footsteps of nature. Take, for example, the beam of a\r\nsteam-engine, such as is given in the sketch, and for which the great\r\nengine at Chatham acted as model. The reader will observe that in this\r\ncase the beam is gradually thickened towards the centre, the ends, where\r\nthe strain is slightest, being comparatively small.\r\n\r\nAnother point also must be noticed. Equal strength could have been\r\nobtained had the beam been solid, but at the expense of weight, and\r\nconsequent waste of power. Lightness is therefore combined with strength\r\nby making the beam consist of a comparatively slight centre, but having\r\nfour bold ridges, as shown in the section given in the accompanying\r\nillustration. This plan, as the reader will see, is exactly the same as\r\nthat which is adopted in the iron mast and porcupine quill, except that\r\nthe ridges are external instead of internal. The same mode of\r\nconstruction is employed in ordinary cranes, the principal beam of which\r\nis almost identical in form with that of the engine, both being thickest\r\nin the centre, and both strengthened with external ridges.\r\n\r\nThere are also other analogies between the hollow mast and natural\r\nobjects. Keeping still to the animal world, we find the quill feathers\r\nof the flying birds to supply examples of the combination of great\r\nstrength with great lightness and very little expenditure of material.\r\nTheir wing bones, too, are hollow, communicating with the lungs, and are\r\nconsequently light as well as strong.\r\n\r\nPassing to the vegetable world, we find a familiar example of this\r\nstructure in the common Wheat Straw. The ripe ear is so heavy, when\r\ncompared with the amount of material which can be spared to carry it,\r\nthat if the stalk were solid it would give way under the mere weight of\r\nthe ear. Moreover, the full-grown corn has to endure much additional\r\nweight when wetted with rain, and to resist much additional force when\r\nbowed by the wind, so that a slight and solid stalk would be quite\r\ninadequate to the task of supporting the ear.\r\n\r\nThe material of the stalk is therefore utilised in a different manner,\r\nbeing formed into a hollow cylinder, the exterior of which is coated\r\nwith a very thin shell of flint, or “silex” as it is scientifically\r\ntermed. The result of this structure is that the stem possesses\r\nstrength, lightness, and elasticity, so as to be equal to the burden\r\nwhich is laid upon it.\r\n\r\nThen there is the common Bamboo, which is little more than a magnified\r\nstraw, being constructed in much the same manner, and possessing almost\r\nthe same constituents of vegetable matter and silex.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most extraordinary of the tubal system is to be found in the\r\nremarkable plant of Guiana called by the natives Ourah, and\r\nscientifically known by the name of _Arundinaria Schomburgkii_. Like the\r\nbamboo, it grows in clusters, and has a feathery top, which waves about\r\nin the breeze. But, instead of decreasing gradually in size from the\r\nbase upwards, the Ourah, although it runs to some fifty feet in height,\r\nis nowhere more than half an inch in diameter. The first joint is about\r\nsixteen feet in length, and uniform in diameter throughout.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely thicker than ordinary pasteboard, and yet so strong and\r\nelastic is it, that it can sustain with ease the weight and strain of\r\nits feathery top as it blows about in the breeze. The natives of certain\r\nparts of Guiana use this reed as a blow-gun, and I have a specimen,\r\npresented to me by the late Mr. Waterton, which is eleven feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nSo the reader will see that when engineers found that hollow iron beams\r\nwere not only lighter, but stronger than solid beams, they were simply\r\ncopying the hollow beams formed by Nature thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER great improvement in ship-building now comes before us.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the earliest boats were merely hollowed logs,\r\njust as Robinson Crusoe is represented to have made. But these had many\r\ndisadvantages. They were always too heavy. They were liable to split, on\r\naccount of flaws in the wood, and if a large vessel were needed, it was\r\ndifficult to find a tree sufficiently large, or to get it down to the\r\nwater when finished.\r\n\r\nSo the next idea was to build a skeleton, so to speak, of light wooden\r\nbeams, and to surround it with an outer clothing, or skin, if it may be\r\nso termed. As far as I know, the two original types of this structure\r\nare the Coracle of the ancient Briton, and the birch-bark Canoe of the\r\nNorth American Indian, and it is not a little remarkable that both exist\r\nto the present day, with scarcely any modification.\r\n\r\nThe Coracle has been already represented on page 22. It is, perhaps, or\r\nwas in its original form, the simplest boat in existence, next to the\r\n“dug-out.” In the times of the very ancient Britons, who were content\r\nwith blue paint by way of dress, and lived by hunting and fishing, the\r\nCoracle was a basin-shaped basket of wicker-work, rather longer than\r\nwide, and covered with the skin of a wild ox. This was sufficiently\r\nlight to be carried by one man, and sufficiently buoyant to bear him\r\ndown rapids, if he were a skilful paddler, and, of course, formed a\r\nconsiderable step in civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe modern Coracle is identical in form, and almost in material. The\r\nframe is still oval and basin-shaped, and made of wicker, but the outer\r\ncovering is not the same. An ox-hide is an expensive article in these\r\ndays, and, especially when wetted, is very heavy. So the modern Coracle\r\nbuilder covers the wicker skin with a piece of tarpaulin, which is much\r\ncheaper than the ox-hide, much lighter, is equally water-tight, and has\r\nthe great advantage of not absorbing moisture, so that it is as light\r\nafter use as before.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux make a boat on very similar principles. It is simply\r\nhideous in form, resembling a huge washing tub in shape, but, as it is\r\nonly intended for the inferior beings called women, this does not\r\nsignify.\r\n\r\nBest, most perfect, and most graceful of all such boats is the\r\nBirch-bark Canoe of the North American Indians, whose shape has\r\nevidently been borrowed from that of a fish. I have seen many of these\r\ncanoes, and have now before me several models which are exactly like the\r\noriginals, except in point of size. Instead of being mere elongated\r\nbowls, like the coracle, they are long and slender, swelling out\r\nconsiderably in the middle, and coming to an almost knife-like edge at\r\neach end. Both stem and stern are alike, so that the canoe can be\r\npaddled in either direction, and, as one of the paddlers always acts as\r\nsteersman, no rudder is needed.\r\n\r\nThe mode of construction is perfectly simple. The labour is divided\r\nbetween the sexes: the women cut large sheets of bark from the\r\nbirch-trees, scrape and smooth them, and then sew them together, so as\r\nto form the outer skin, or “cloak” as it is called, of the canoe.\r\nMeanwhile the men are making the skeleton of strips of white cedar-wood,\r\nand binding them into shape with thongs made of the inner bark of the\r\nsame tree, just like the “bass” of our gardeners. The “cloak” is then\r\ngradually worked over the skeleton, sewn into its place, and the canoe\r\nis finished. A figure of this canoe, as completed, is given in the same\r\nillustration as that which represents various forms of boat, page 7.\r\n\r\nThe last improvement is that which was caused by the necessity for large\r\nvessels, when planks or iron plates were fastened over the skeleton.\r\nBut, in all these cases, the vessel is built on the principle of the\r\nthorax of a vertebrate animal, that of the whale or a fish being an\r\nadmirable example. It only needs to take the skeleton of a whale, turn\r\nit on its back, and the ribs will be seen to form an almost exact\r\nreproduction of those of any ship being built in the nearest dockyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIBS OF FISH. RIBS OF SHIP.]\r\n\r\nI have now before me the spine and ribs of a herring. The fish was\r\nover-boiled, and the flesh fell off the bones as it was being lifted out\r\nof the dish, leaving most of the ribs in their places. When held with\r\nthe spine downwards, and viewed from one end, the resemblance to the\r\nframework of a ship is absolutely startling, the ribs representing the\r\nbeams, and the spine taking the place of the keel. I have also before me\r\na sketch representing a section of a Fijian canoe, and it is remarkable\r\nthat even the very curve of the ribs of the herring is reproduced in\r\nthose of the canoe.\r\n\r\nWhether the Fijians derived this peculiar and beautiful curve from the\r\nribs of a fish I cannot say, but think it very likely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA STILL greater improvement in ship-building now comes before us, and\r\nthis also has been anticipated both in the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms. There are so many examples of this anticipation that I can\r\nonly give one or two.\r\n\r\nThe improvement to which I refer is that which is now almost universally\r\nemployed in the construction of iron ships, namely, the making the outer\r\nshell double instead of single, and dividing it into a number of\r\nseparate compartments. Putting aside the advantage that if the vessel\r\nwere stove, only one compartment would fill, we have the fact that the\r\nship is at the same time enormously strengthened and very light in\r\nproportion to her bulk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSECTION OF ELEPHANT SKULL.     TRANSVERSE SECTION OF IRON SHIP.\r\nSTELLATE TISSUES.              LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF IRON SHIP.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best, and certainly the most obvious, example of this\r\nprinciple in the animal world is to be found in the skull of the\r\nElephant. The enormous tusks, with their powerful leverage, the massive\r\nteeth, and the large and weighty proboscis, require a corresponding\r\nsupply of muscles, and consequently a large surface of bone for the\r\nattachments of these muscles. Now, were the skull solid in proportion to\r\nits requisite size, its weight would be too much for the neck to endure,\r\nhowever short and sturdy it might be. The mode of attaining expanse of\r\nsurface, together with lightness of structure, is singularly beautiful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may not be aware that the bone of the skull\r\nconsists of an outer and inner plate, with a variable arrangement of\r\ncells between them. In many animals, such, for example, as man, where\r\nthe jaws are comparatively feeble, and the teeth small and light, the\r\nsize of the skull is practically that of the brain, to which it affords\r\na covering. The same structure may be observed in the skull of the\r\ncommon sparrow, where, as in man, the two bony plates are set almost in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nBut in the elephant these external and internal plates are set widely\r\napart, and the space between them is filled with bony cells, much\r\nresembling those of a honeycomb. They are, in fact, just the same cells\r\nas those which exist in the skull of man and sparrow, but they are very\r\nmuch enlarged, and in consequence give a large surface, accompanied with\r\nunited strength and lightness.\r\n\r\nThere are many other examples in the animal kingdom, but our limited\r\nspace will not allow them to be even mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAS to the vegetable examples of this principle, they are so\r\nmultitudinous that only a very slight description can be given of them.\r\n\r\nI suppose that most boys have seen a “cane” (whether they have felt it\r\nor not is not to the purpose), and some boys have made sham cigars from\r\npieces of cane. In either case they must have noticed that the cane is\r\nnot solid, but is pierced with a vast number of holes, passing\r\nlongitudinally through it, and is, in fact, a collection of little tubes\r\nconnected and bound together by a common envelope.\r\n\r\nThe Sugar-cane, if cut across, is seen also to consist of multitudinous\r\ncells, which, however, are not hollow, but filled with the sweet liquid\r\nfrom which sugar is obtained by boiling. Then there are many of our\r\ncommon English plants, like the ordinary rush or reed, which are very\r\nslight in diameter in comparison with their length, and in which the\r\ncells are still further strengthened and lightened by the projection of\r\ntheir sides into a number of points which meet each other, and leave\r\ninterstices between them. This modification of the cellular system is\r\ncalled “Stellate” (or star-like) Tissue, and two examples of it are\r\ngiven in the illustration, one being taken from the common rush, and the\r\nother from the seed-coat of the privet.

Now, even in small vessels, the hempen cable\r\nhas been superseded by the iron chain, and this for several reasons.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is much smaller in bulk, and therefore does not\r\noccupy so much room. In the next place, it is even lighter than the\r\nhempen cable of corresponding strength; and, in the third, its specific\r\ngravity--_i.e._ its weight when compared with an equal bulk of\r\nwater--is so great, that when submerged, it falls into a sort of\r\narch-like form, and so attains an elasticity which takes off much of the\r\nstrain on the anchor, and protects it from dragging.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now look to Nature for Cables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nEGG OF DOG-FISH.           PINNA.           ANCHORED BOAT.\r\n                    WATER-SNAIL ANCHORED\r\n                     TO WATER-LILY LEAF.]\r\n\r\nThe natural cable which will first suggest itself is evidently that of\r\nthe Pinna Shell (_Pinna pectinata_), which fixes its shell to some rock\r\nor stone with a number of silk-like threads, spun by itself, and\r\nprotruding from the base, just as a vessel on a lee shore throws out a\r\nnumber of cables. The threads which compose the “byssus,” as it is\r\ncalled, are only a few inches in length, and apparently slight. They\r\nare, however, really strong, and by acting in unison enable the shell,\r\nthough sometimes two feet in length, to be held firmly to the rock. I\r\nmay here mention that they have been occasionally woven into gloves, and\r\nother articles of apparel, to which their natural soft grey-brown hue\r\ngives a very pleasing appearance.\r\n\r\nA still more familiar instance of a natural marine cable is given by the\r\ncommon Mussel, which can be found in thousands on almost every solid\r\nsubstance which affords it a hold. Even copper-bottomed ships are often\r\ncovered with Mussels, all clinging by their natural cables, and it is\r\nthought that the cases which sometimes occur of being poisoned by eating\r\nMussels, or “musselled,” as the malady is called by the seafaring\r\npopulation, are due to the fact that the Mussels have anchored\r\nthemselves to copper, and have in consequence imbibed the verdigris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSING from salt to fresh water, we come to a natural cable which is\r\nvery common, and yet, on account of its practical invisibility, is\r\nalmost unknown, except by naturalists. I refer to the curious cable\r\nwhich is constructed by the common Water-snail (_Limnæa stagnalis_),\r\nwhich has already been mentioned in its capacity of a boat.\r\n\r\nThis creature has a way of attaching itself to some fixed object, such\r\nas a water-lily leaf, by means of a gelatinous thread, which it can\r\nelongate at pleasure, and by means of which it can retain its position\r\nin a stream, or in still water can sink itself to the bottom, and ascend\r\nto the same spot. This cable seems to be made of the same glairy\r\nsecretion as that which surrounds the egg-masses which are found so\r\nplentifully on leaves and stones in our fresh waters, and, like that\r\nsubstance, is all but invisible in the water, so that an inexperienced\r\neye would not be able to see it, even if it were pointed out.\r\n\r\nSlight, gelatinous, and almost invisible in the water as is this thread,\r\nits strength is very much greater than might be supposed. Not only can a\r\nmollusc be safely moored in the water by such a cable, but it can be\r\nactually suspended in the air, as may be seen from a letter in\r\nHardwicke’s _Science Gossip_ for 1875, p. 190:--\r\n\r\n“Last summer (September 29) I met with the following unusual fact. In a\r\ngreen-house, from a vine-leaf which was within a few inches of the glass\r\n... a slug was hanging by a thread, which was more than four feet in\r\nlength, not unlike a spider-web, but evidently much stronger.\r\n\r\n“The slug was descending by means of this thread, and, as the glutinous\r\nmatter from the under part of the body was drawn out by the weight of\r\nthe creature, it was consolidated into a compact thread by the slug\r\ntwisting itself in the direction of the hands of a clock, the power of\r\ntwisting being given by the head, and the part of the body nearest the\r\nhead being turned in the direction of the twist. There was no tendency\r\nto turn in the contrary direction. Evidently the thread became hard as\r\nsoon as it was drawn away from the body.\r\n\r\n“By wetting the sides of slips of glass, I secured two specimens of the\r\nthread. In one of these, part was stretched, and part quite loose, the\r\nlatter appearing flat when seen through a microscope. The thread, which\r\nwas highly elastic, was increased about three inches in a minute. The\r\nslug was white, and about an inch and a half in length.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we come to the elastic system of the Chain Cable, and find it\r\nanticipated in Nature in various ways.\r\n\r\nOne curious example was that of a Spider, which found its wheel-like net\r\nin danger from a tempestuous wind. The Spider descended to the ground, a\r\ndepth of about seven feet, and, instead of attaching its thread to a\r\nstone or plant, fastened it to a piece of loose stick, hauled it up a\r\nfew feet clear of the ground, and then went back to its web. The piece\r\nof stick thus left suspended acted in a most admirable manner, giving\r\nstrength and support, and at the same time yielding partly to the wind.\r\n\r\nBy accident the thread became broken, and the stick, which was about as\r\nthick as an ordinary pencil, and not quite three inches in length, fell\r\nto the ground. The Spider immediately descended, attached another\r\nthread, and hauled it up as before. In a day or two, when the\r\ntempestuous weather had ceased, the Spider voluntarily cut the thread,\r\nand allowed the then useless stick to drop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA CURIOUS example of the elastic cable is seen in the egg-case of the\r\nDog-fish, which is given on page 35. The egg-case is formed like that of\r\nthe common skate, and has a projection from each of its angles. But the\r\nprojections, instead of being mere flattened horns, are lengthened into\r\nlong elastic strings, tapering towards the ends, and twisted spirally,\r\nlike the tendrils of a grape-vine.\r\n\r\nThese tendril-like appendages twist themselves round seaweeds and other\r\nobjects, and, on account of their spiral form, can hardly ever be torn\r\nfrom their attachments. Sometimes after a storm the egg is thrown on the\r\nshore, still clinging to the seaweed, but to find an egg detached is\r\nvery rarely done.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the tendrils of the vine, and their great\r\nstrength. The reader may remember the corresponding cases of the Pea and\r\nthe Bryony, the latter being a most remarkable example of the strength\r\ngained by the spiral form. It clambers about hedges, is exposed to the\r\nfiercest winds, has large and broad leaves, and yet such a thing as a\r\nBryony being blown off a hedge is scarcely, if ever, seen. I never saw\r\nan example myself, though I have had long experience in hedges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER excellent example of this principle is found in the Vallisneria\r\nplant, which of late years has become tolerably familiar to us through\r\nthe means of fresh-water aquaria, though it is not indigenous to this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn this plant the elastic power of the spiral cable is beautifully\r\ndeveloped. It is an aquatic plant, mostly found in running waters, and\r\nhas a most singular mode of development. It is diœcious--_i.e._ the\r\nmale, or stamen-bearing, and the female, or pistil-bearing flowers, grow\r\nupon separate plants.\r\n\r\nIt has to deposit its seeds in the bed of the stream, and yet it is\r\nnecessary that both sets of flowers should be exposed to the air and sun\r\nbefore they become able to perform their several duties. Add to this the\r\nfact that the male flower is quite as small in proportion to the female\r\nas is the case with the lac and scale insects, and the problem of their\r\nreaching each other becomes apparently intricate, though it is solved in\r\na beautifully simple manner.\r\n\r\nFertilisation cannot be conducted by means of insects, as is the case\r\nwith so many diœcious terrestrial plants, and it is absolutely\r\nnecessary that actual contact should take place between them. This\r\ndifficult process is effected as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe female flowers are attached to a very long spiral and closely coiled\r\nfootstalk, and, when they are sufficiently developed, the footstalk\r\nelongates itself until the flower rests on the surface of the water,\r\nwhere it is safely anchored by its spiral cable, the coils yielding to\r\nthe wavelets, and keeping the flower in its place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tiny male flowers are being developed at the bottom of the\r\nriver, and are attached to very short footstalks. When they are quite\r\nripe they disengage themselves from their footstalks, and rise to the\r\nsurface of the river. Being carried along by the stream, they are sure\r\nto come in contact with the anchored female flowers. This having been\r\ndone, and the seeds beginning to be developed, the spiral footstalk\r\nagain coils itself tightly, and brings the seeds close to the bed of the\r\nstream, where they can take root.\r\n\r\nThere are other numerous examples, of which any reader, even slightly\r\nskilled in botany, need not be reminded, most of them being, in one form\r\nor another, modifications of the leaf or the petal, which, after all,\r\nare much the same thing. The vine and passion-flower are, however,\r\npartial exceptions.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that soon after the failure of the first Atlantic\r\ntelegraph cable, an invention was patented of a very much lighter cable,\r\nenclosed in a tube of india-rubber, and being coiled spirally at certain\r\ndistances, so that the coils might give the elasticity which constitutes\r\nstrength. The cable was never made, its manufacture proving to be too\r\ncostly; but the idea of lightness and elasticity, having been evidently\r\ntaken from the spiral tendrils of the bryony, was certainly a good one,\r\nand I should have wished to see it tried on a smaller scale than the\r\nAtlantic requires.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAS a natural consequence, after the cable comes the Anchor, which in\r\nalmost every form has been anticipated by Nature, whether it be called\r\nby the name of anchor, kedge, drag, or grapnel.\r\n\r\nOn the accompanying illustrations are shown a number of corresponding\r\nforms of the Anchor, together with a few others, which, although they\r\nmay not necessarily be used in the water, are nevertheless constructed\r\non the same principle--_i.e._ for the purpose of grappling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPICULES OF SYNAPTA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT ANCHOR.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most startling parallels may be seen on the right hand of the\r\nillustration, the figure having been drawn from an old Roman coin. On\r\nthe other side of the same illustration may be seen an anchor so\r\nexactly similar in form, that the outline of the one would almost answer\r\nfor that of the other. This object is a much-magnified representation of\r\na spicule which is found on the skin of the Synapta, one of the\r\nso-called Sea-slugs, which are so extensively sold under the name of\r\nBêche de Mer. It forms one of the curious group called the Holothuridæ.\r\n\r\nEach of these anchors is affixed to a sort of open-worked shield, as\r\nshown above, and on the left hand; and it is a curious fact that in the\r\nvarious species of Synapta the anchor is rather different in form, and\r\nthe shield very different in pattern. They are lovely objects, and I\r\nrecommend any of my readers who possess a microscope to procure one.\r\nThey need a power of at least 150 diameters to show their full beauties.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary Grapnel is here shown, and in the corresponding position on\r\nthe opposite side is an almost exactly similar object, except that it is\r\ndouble, having the grapnel at both ends of the stem. This is a spicule\r\nof a species of sponge, and is one of the vast numbers of which the\r\nsponge principally consists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LERNENTOMA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ECHINOCOCCUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPONGE-SPICULE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAPNEL.]\r\n\r\nNext to the sponge-spicule is a still more perfect example of a natural\r\nGrapnel. This is the head of an internal parasite called Echinococcus,\r\nwhich holds itself in its position by means of the circle of hooks with\r\nwhich the head is surrounded. These hooks are easily detached, and have\r\na curious resemblance to the claw of the lion or tiger.\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand side is a representation of a parasitic crustacean\r\nanimal called Lernentoma, which adheres to various fishes, and is mostly\r\nfound upon the sprat, clinging to the gills by means of its\r\ngrapnel-shaped head.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the accompanying illustration is an ice-anchor,\r\ncopied from one of those which were taken out in the Arctic expedition\r\nof 1875. Opposite is the skull of the Walrus, the tusks of which are\r\nsaid to be used for exactly the same purpose. Below are ice-hooks, also\r\nused for the same expedition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUSKS OF WALRUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE-ANCHOR AND ICE-HOOKS.]\r\n\r\nThe next illustration exhibits a butcher’s hook and a common porter’s\r\nhook, by which he lifts sacks on his back; and opposite them are some\r\nsponge-spicules, the similarity of which in form is so remarkable that\r\nthe former might have been copied from the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPONGE-SPICULES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTCHER’S HOOK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTER’S HOOK.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSHROOM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSHROOM KEDGE.]\r\n\r\nOur next sketch shows a remarkable example of similitude in form. There\r\nare certain small anchors called Kedges, which are very useful for\r\nmooring a boat where no great power of resistance has to be overcome,\r\nand a large anchor would be cumbersome. One of these is called, from its\r\nshape, the “Mushroom Kedge,” and is very useful, as, however it may be\r\ndropped, some part of the edge is sure to take the ground. This Kedge is\r\nshown on the right hand of the illustration, and the Mushroom, from\r\nwhich its shape was borrowed, is seen on the left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to some more examples of the principle of the Grapnel, some\r\nof which are applied to nautical, and others to terrestrial objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAGLE-CLAW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLESH-HOOK.]\r\n\r\nThe right-hand upper figure represents the “Flesh-hook,” used for taking\r\nboiled meat out of the caldron, so familiar to us by the reference to it\r\nin Exodus xxvii. 3, and the still better-known allusion to its office in\r\n1 Samuel ii. 13, 14. In the former passage, even the material, brass,\r\nwhich was really what we now call bronze, is mentioned, and it is a\r\ncurious fact that all the specimens in the British Museum, from one of\r\nwhich the drawing was taken, are made of bronze. I need hardly state\r\nthat the hollow handle is meant to receive a wooden staff.\r\n\r\nOn comparing this figure with that of the Eagle’s foot on the opposite\r\nside, the reader cannot but be struck with the exact resemblance between\r\nthe two. Indeed, there is very little doubt that the flesh-hook was\r\nintentionally copied from the foot of some bird of prey. Perhaps the\r\nOsprey would have furnished even a better example than the Eagle, the\r\nclaws being sharper and more boldly curved, so as to hold their slippery\r\nprey the better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the next illustration is a figure of the seed-vessel\r\nof the Grapple-plant of Southern Africa, drawn from a specimen in my\r\ncollection. The seed-vessel is several inches in length, and the\r\ntraveller who is caught by a single hook had better wait for assistance\r\nthan try to release himself. The stems of the plant are so slender, and\r\nthe armed seed-vessels so numerous, that in attempting to rescue one\r\nportion of the dress, another portion becomes entangled, and the\r\ntraveller gets hopelessly captured. Besides the hooks of the\r\nseed-vessels, the branches themselves are armed with long thorns, set in\r\npairs. The scientific name of this plant is _Uncinaria procumbens_, the\r\nformer word signifying “a hook,” and the latter “trailing.” It is also\r\nknown by the popular name of Hook-plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAPPLE-PLANT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAG.]\r\n\r\nIn the late Kafir wars the natives made great use of this and other\r\nplants with similar properties, their own naked, dark, and oiled bodies\r\nslipping through them easily and unseen, while the scarlet coats of the\r\nsoldiers were quickly entangled, and made them an easy mark for the\r\nKafir’s spear. In this way many more of our soldiers were killed by the\r\nspears than by the bullets of their enemies.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the Grapple-plant is shown the common Drag, which is\r\nutilised for so many purposes. Generally it is employed for recovering\r\nobjects that have sunk to the bottom of the water, and its use by the\r\nofficers of the Humane Society is perfectly well known, the Drag being\r\nsometimes affixed to the end of a long pole, like the flesh-hook already\r\ndescribed, and sometimes tied to a rope.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used as an anchor, after the manner of a kedge, and has\r\nbeen often employed in naval engagements for the purpose of drawing two\r\nships together, and preventing the escape of the vessel which is being\r\nworsted. My relative, the late Admiral Sir J. Harvey, K.B., used drags\r\nin this manner, and secured two French ships, one on either side,\r\nnamely, _L’Achille_ and _Le Vengeur_. The first was sunk, and the second\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUTICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSUBSIDIARY APPLIANCES.\r\n\r\nPART III.--THE BOAT-HOOK AND PUNT-POLE.--THE LIFE-BUOY AND PONTOON-RAFT.\r\n\r\n     The Boat-hook and its varied Uses.--The Earth-worm and the\r\n     Serpula.--Microscopic Boat-hooks.--The Life-belt.--Life-boats and\r\n     their Structure.--Uses of Cork.--Wine Corks made serviceable.--The\r\n     Life-collar.--Portuguese Man-of-war.--Captain Boyton’s\r\n     Life-dress.--The Life-raft.--Victualling a Yacht and Boat.--The\r\n     Janthina and its Air-vessels.--Cask-pontoon--Pottery-raft and its\r\n     Uses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs all rowing men know, an indispensable appliance to the boat is the\r\nBoat-hook, which can be used either as a pole, wherewith to push the\r\nboat along, or as a grapnel, by which it can be drawn towards the shore\r\nor a ship. As the latter portion has been discussed at the close of the\r\npreceding chapter, we may proceed to the former.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how a boat may be propelled by a pole pressed against\r\nthe bank or the bottom of the water, and that there are certain boats,\r\ncalled punts, which are propelled in no other way.\r\n\r\nNow, the punt-poles and boat-hooks, of which some examples are given in\r\nthe accompanying illustration, have long been anticipated in Nature,\r\nthere being many creatures which have no other mode of progression;\r\nsuch, for example, as the common Earth-worm, which pushes itself along\r\nby certain bristles which project from the rings of which the body is\r\ncomposed, and which have the power of extension and contraction to a\r\nwonderful extent. As, however, I shall advert to these in another part\r\nof the work, I will content myself at present with a single example,\r\nnamely, the beautiful marine worm known as the Serpula.\r\n\r\nThis worm lives in a shelly tube, which is lined with a delicate\r\nmembrane, up and down which it passes with ease, ascending slowly, but\r\ngenerally descending with such wonderful rapidity that the eye cannot\r\nfollow its movements. The latter movement will be explained in a\r\nsubsequent part of the book, and we will at present only treat of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUSHING SPIKES OF SERPULA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOAT-HOOKS AND PUNT-POLES.]\r\n\r\nIf the creature be removed from the tube, and carefully examined, a\r\nnumber of projections will be seen, in each of which is a perforation.\r\nIf the animal be pressed, a slight glass-like bristle passes through the\r\nperforation, and can easily be removed. If properly treated, and placed\r\nunder a high power of the microscope, the tiny bristle resolves itself\r\ninto the remarkable object which is shown on the left hand of the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a number of spear-like rods, each having a straight\r\nshaft, and a curved and pointed tip, deeply barbed on the inner portion\r\nof the curve. These curious bundles of spicules can be protruded or\r\nretracted at pleasure, and, as they are all directed backwards, it is\r\nevident that when they are pushed against the sides of the tube, either\r\nthe points or the barbs must catch against the membrane which lines the\r\ntube, and so propel the animal upwards. When it wishes to descend, it\r\nuses another set of implements, and withdraws the first within their\r\nsheaths.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly analogous to the mode of progression employed by\r\npunters, who, after they have placed the pole against the bed of the\r\nstream, and run along the punt so as to push it as fast as possible,\r\nimmediately withdraw the pole, and take it to the head of the punt,\r\nready for another push. This, as the reader will see, is exactly the\r\nplan pursued by the Serpula in lengthening itself when it wishes to\r\nadvance, and so to press its spicules against the sides of its tube,\r\nand in shortening itself and withdrawing the spicules ready for another\r\npush.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER needful accessory of vessels now comes before us, namely, the\r\ncapability of forming rafts or life-belts, which will float under any\r\ncircumstances. Here, again, every human invention of which I know has\r\nbeen anticipated by Nature. Take, for example, the familiar instance of\r\nthe cork life-belt and the cork edgings of the life-boat. Both are\r\nconstructed on the same principle, _i.e._ the maintenance of cells which\r\nare filled by air instead of water, and are impervious to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe material most used for this purpose is cork, and life-belts\r\nconstructed of it have long been in well-deserved use, the cork-bark\r\nhaving the property of holding much air and excluding water. Many of our\r\nlife-boats are furnished with a broad and thick streak of cork, so that\r\neven if the boat be filled with water and upset, she will right herself\r\nand swim. I regret to say that many of the so-called “life-belts” which\r\nare offered for sale ought rather to be called “death-belts,” they\r\nhaving been found to be filled with hay and straw, with only a few\r\nshavings of cork just under the covering of the belt.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so buoyant is this substance that a very efficient belt can be\r\nmade by stringing together three or four rows of ordinary wine corks,\r\nand tying them round the neck like a collar. Under these circumstances\r\nit is simply impossible to sink, and though any one may collapse from\r\nexhaustion, drowning is almost out of the question. The now well-known\r\ncork mattress, which is used in many ships, is another example of the\r\nsame principle.\r\n\r\nLately there has been invented a “life-collar,” which possesses similar\r\nadvantages, but occupies less space when not wanted. It is nothing more\r\nthan a tube of caoutchouc, which can be inflated at pleasure, and tied\r\nround the neck. The ordinary life-belt goes round the waist, and needs\r\nmuch more material without obtaining a better result, which is simply\r\nthe keeping of the mouth and nostrils out of the water.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most buoyant of living beings is the Portuguese Man-of-war\r\n(_Physalis pelagicus_), which floats on the surface of the ocean like a\r\nbubble. It can at pleasure distend itself with air and float, or\r\ndischarge the air and sink.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a very remarkable swimming dress, which, though not\r\nentirely invented, was at least perfected by Captain Boyton, and which,\r\nas it enabled the wearer to cross from France to England under rather\r\nunfavourable circumstances, is clearly a most valuable invention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTUGUESE MAN-OF-WAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN BOYTON’S LIFE-DRESS.]\r\n\r\nWhether the inventor knew it or not I cannot say, but the Boyton\r\nlife-dress is simply a modification of the Physalis, being capable of\r\ndilatation with air at will.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSO much for the individual life-belt, and we will now pass to those\r\nwhich are intended to sustain more than one individual. It has almost\r\ninvariably been found that when a ship has been wrecked on a rock, or\r\nstove in by the sea, that, although there may be plenty of boats, there\r\nis great difficulty in getting them into the water rightly.\r\n\r\nNow, if parts of the ship itself could be made of materials which could\r\nnot be sunk except by enormous pressure, and which might be released by\r\na touch if the vessel were sinking, it is evident that many lives would\r\nbe saved which have now been lost.\r\n\r\nAnd if such movable parts of the vessel were supplied with water and\r\nprovisions in air-tight cases, there is no doubt that the number of\r\n“missing” ships would be very greatly diminished. I remember an instance\r\nwhere a yacht was “hung up” on a mud-bank, whence there was no escape,\r\nfor twenty-four hours, and there was one sandwich on board to be divided\r\namong the owner, two men, and a boy. Of course the boy had the sandwich,\r\nand the men sustained themselves as well as they could with tea, of\r\nwhich there was, fortunately, a canister on board. As it was, they were\r\nsome thirty-six hours without food.\r\n\r\nAfter such an experience the owner had special lockers made in the yacht\r\nand her boat, containing biscuit, potted meats, water, wine, spirits,\r\ntobacco, tea, an “etna” for heating the water, and matches. Of course\r\nthese were on a smaller scale in the boat; but several thick rugs were\r\nalso stowed away, in case of being separated from the yacht at night. It\r\nso happened that they were never needed; but the sense of security which\r\nthey imparted was worth ten times the expense and trouble, which\r\nincluded a careful inspection of all the stores before each voyage.\r\n\r\nIn Nature there is just such a raft as is needed, capable of carrying a\r\nheavy freight, and which cannot be upset. And it is rather remarkable\r\nthat it has been unconsciously imitated in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JANTHINA AND AIR-RAFT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASK-PONTOON. POTTERY-RAFT OF THE NILE.]\r\n\r\nThis is the singular apparatus attached to the Violet Snail (_Janthina\r\ncommunis_), which is common enough in the Atlantic, and derives its name\r\nof Violet-shell from its beautiful colour. The chief interest, however,\r\ncentres in the apparatus which is popularly called the “raft,” and which\r\nsustains the shell and eggs. It is made of a great number of\r\nair-vessels, affixed closely to each other, and by the curious property\r\nof bearing its cargo slung beneath it instead of being laid upon it.\r\n\r\nBeneath the raft are the eggs, or rather, the capsules which contain the\r\neggs, and at one end is the beautiful violet shell itself. The floating\r\npower of the raft is really astonishing, and even in severe tempests,\r\nwhen it is broken away from the animal, the raft continues to float on\r\nthe surface of the waves, bearing its cargo with it.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the illustration are two examples of rafts\r\nconstructed so exactly on the same principle as that of the Violet\r\nSnail, that they both might have been borrowed from it.\r\n\r\nThe upper is the kind of raft which has often been constructed by\r\nsailors when trying to escape from a sinking ship, or by soldiers when\r\nwishing to convey troops across a river, and having no regular\r\n“pontoons” at hand. It is made simply by lashing a number of empty casks\r\nto a flooring of beams and planks.\r\n\r\nThe amount of weight which such a structure will support is really\r\nastonishing, as long as the casks remain whole, and to upset it is\r\nalmost impossible. Even cannon can be taken across wide expanses of\r\nwater in perfect safety, and there is hardly anything more awkward of\r\nconveyance than a cannon, with its own enormous and concentrated weight,\r\nand all the needful paraphernalia of limber, ammunition (which may not\r\nbe wetted, and of immense weight), horses, and men.\r\n\r\nYet even this heterogeneous mass of living and lifeless weight can be\r\ncarried on the cask-raft, which is an exact imitation of the living raft\r\nof the Violet Snail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBENEATH the cask-pontoon is to be seen a sketch of a very curious vessel\r\nwhich is in use on the Nile, and I rather think on the Ganges also,\r\nthough I am not quite sure. It is formed in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nIn both countries there are whole families who from generation to\r\ngeneration have lived in little villages up the river, and gained their\r\nliving by making pottery, mostly of a simple though artistic form, the\r\nvessel having a rather long and slender neck, and a more or less\r\nglobular body.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has made a sufficient number of these vessels, he lashes them\r\ntogether with their mouths uppermost, and then fixes upon them a simple\r\nplatform of reeds. The papyrus was once largely used for this purpose,\r\nbut it seems to be gradually abandoned.\r\n\r\nHe thus forms a pontoon exactly similar in principle with the\r\ncask-pontoon which has just been described. Then, taking his place on\r\nhis buoyant raft, he floats down the river until he comes to some\r\npopulous town, takes his raft to pieces, sells the pots and reeds, and\r\nmakes his way home again by land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AND HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE PITFALL, THE CLUB, THE SWORD, THE SPEAR AND DAGGER.\r\n\r\n     Analogy between War and Hunting.--The Pitfall as used for both\r\n     Purposes.--African Pitfalls for large Game, and their Armature for\r\n     preventing the Escape of Prey.--Its Use in this Country on a\r\n     miniature scale.--Mr. Waterton’s Mouse-trap.--Pitfall of the\r\n     Ant-lion, and its Armature for preventing the Escape of Prey.--The\r\n     Club and its Origin.--Gradual Development of the Weapon.--The\r\n     “Pine-apple” Club of Fiji.--The Game of Pallone and the\r\n     “Bracciale.”--The Irish Shillelagh.--Clubs and Maces of Wood,\r\n     Metal, or mixed.--The Morgenstern.--Ominous Jesting.--Natural\r\n     Clubs.--The Durian, the Diodon, and the Horse-chestnut.--The Sword,\r\n     or flattened and sharpened Club.--Natural and artificial Armature\r\n     of the Edge.--The Sword-grass, Leech, and Saw-fish.--Spears and\r\n     Swords armed with Bones and Stones.--The Spear and Dagger, and\r\n     their Analogies.--Structure of the Spear.--The Bamboo as a Weapon\r\n     of War or Hunting.--Singular Combat, and its Results.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two subjects which are here mentioned are practically one, the\r\nwarfare being in the one case carried on against mankind, and in the\r\nother against the lower animals, the means employed being often the same\r\nin both cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PITFALL.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest examples of this double use is afforded by the\r\nPitfall, which is employed in almost every part of the world, and,\r\nalthough mostly used for hunting, still keeps its place in warfare.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the accompanying illustration is shown a section of\r\nthe Pitfall which is so commonly used in Africa for the capture of large\r\ngame. It is, as may be seen, a conical hole, the bottom of which is\r\narmed with a pointed stake. Should a large animal fall into the pit, the\r\nshape of the sides forces it upon the stake, by which it is transfixed.\r\nEven elephants of the largest size often fall victims to this simple\r\ntrap. It is only large enough to receive the fore-legs and chest, but\r\nthat is quite sufficient to cause the death of the animal, the stake\r\npenetrating to the heart.\r\n\r\nMany a hunter has fallen into these traps, and found great difficulty in\r\nescaping, while some have not escaped at all. Indeed, in many parts of\r\nSouthern Africa, when part of one tribe is about to visit another, the\r\npitfalls are always unmasked, lest the intended guests should fall into\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PITFALL OF ANT-LION FOR CATCHING INSECTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFRICAN PITFALL FOR CATCHING LARGE GAME.]\r\n\r\nEven without the spike, the elephant would scarcely be able to save\r\nitself, owing to its enormous weight, unless helped out by its comrades\r\nbefore the hunters came up. Indeed, many pitfalls are intentionally made\r\nfor this purpose, and are of a different shape, _i.e._ about eight feet\r\nin length and four in breadth.\r\n\r\nIn those which are made for the capture of the giraffe, the pit is very\r\ndeep, and the place of the stake is occupied by a transverse wall, which\r\nprevents the feet of the captive from touching the ground, and keeps it\r\nsuspended until the hunters can come and kill it at leisure.\r\n\r\nEven in Belgium and our own country the pitfall is in use. When the\r\nfield-mice were devastating the districts about Liege some years ago,\r\ntheir ravages were effectually checked by pitfalls, in which they were\r\ncaught by bushels, the pitfalls being simple holes some two feet deep,\r\nand made wider below than above.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Waterton contrived to rid his garden of field-mice by\r\npitfalls constructed on the same principle, though more permanent.\r\nFinding that the little animals made great havoc among his peas just as\r\nthey were starting out of the ground, he buried between the rows a\r\nnumber of earthen pickle-jars, sinking them to the level of the ground.\r\nHe then rubbed the inside of the neck with bacon, and left them. The\r\nmice stooped down to lick off the bacon, fell into the jars, and, the\r\nneck being narrow and the sides slippery, they could not get out again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration is the section of a pitfall made by\r\nthe well-known Ant-lion (_Myrmeleo_), of which there are several\r\nspecies. The history of this wonderful insect is so familiar to us that\r\nit need not be repeated at length. Suffice it to say that it digs\r\nconical pitfalls in loose sandy soil, and that it places itself at the\r\nbottom of the pit, securing the insect victims with its jaws just as the\r\nlarger animals are secured by the stake of the human hunter.\r\n\r\nIt makes no false cover, as does the human hunter, but it always chooses\r\nsoil so loose that if an insect approach the edge, the sand gives way,\r\nand it goes sliding down into the pit, whence its chance of escape is\r\nvery small, even were there no deadly jaws at the bottom ready to\r\nreceive it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLUB.\r\n\r\nThe simplest of all offensive weapons is necessarily the CLUB. At first,\r\nthis was but a simple stick, such as any savage might form from a branch\r\nof a tree by knocking off the small boughs with a stone or another\r\nstick. Such clubs are still used in Australia, and I have several in my\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThen the inventive genius of man improved their destructive power by\r\nvarious means. The most obvious plan was to add to the force of its blow\r\nby simply making one end much thicker and heavier than the other. This\r\nis done in the “Knob-kerry” of Southern Africa, and it is worthy of\r\nremark that in Fiji a weapon exists so exactly like the short knob-kerry\r\nof Africa, that an inexperienced eye would scarcely be able to\r\ndistinguish between them.\r\n\r\nThe next plan was to arm the enlarged head with projecting pieces or\r\nspikes, sometimes cut out of the solid wood, and sometimes artificially\r\ninserted. The “Shillelagh” of Ireland is a simple example of this kind\r\nof club. One of the best and most elaborate examples of this sort of\r\nweapon is the “Pine-apple” Club of Fiji, a figure of which may be seen\r\nin the illustration, drawn from a specimen in my collection.\r\n\r\nIt is made in the most ingenious manner from a tree which is trained for\r\nthe purpose. There are certain trees belonging to the palm tribe which\r\npossess “aërial” roots, _i.e._ subsidiary roots, which surround the\r\ntrunk at some distance from the ground, and assist in supporting it.\r\nSome trees have no central root, and are entirely upborne by the aërial\r\nroots, while others have both.\r\n\r\nOne of these latter is selected, and when it is very young is bent over\r\nand fastened to the ground almost at right angles, as shown in the\r\nillustration. When it has grown to a sufficient age it is cut to the\r\nrequisite length, the central root is sharpened to a point, and the\r\naërial roots are also cut down in such a way that they radiate very much\r\nlike the projections on a pine-apple. This is really an ingenious\r\nweapon, for if the long and sharpened end should miss its aim, the\r\nprojections would be tolerably sure to inflict painful if not\r\nimmediately dangerous injuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DURIAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLLEN OF HOLLYHOCK. HORSE-CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODEN AND METAL CLUBS.]\r\n\r\nAs the pine-apple is so well known, I have given in the opposite side of\r\nthe illustration a figure of the Durian, a large Bornean fruit, which is\r\ncovered with projections almost identical in appearance with those of\r\nthe pine-apple club, and almost equally hard and heavy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may have heard of the grand Italian game of\r\nPallone, the “game of giants,” as it has been called. The ball, which\r\nis a large and rather heavy one, weighing more than twice as much as a\r\ncricket-ball, is struck with a wooden gauntlet reaching nearly half-way\r\nup the fore-arm. The original gauntlet was cut entirely out of the solid\r\nwood, and exactly resembled the exterior of the Durian. The modern\r\ngauntlet, however, has the spikes fixed separately into a wooden frame,\r\nso that they can be replaced if broken in the course of the game. The\r\nprinciple, however, is identical in all three cases. The technical name\r\nof this gauntlet is Bracciale.\r\n\r\nThe next improvement was to add still further to the destructive powers\r\nof the club by arming it with stones, so as to make it harder and\r\nheavier. Sometimes a stone is perforated, and the end of the club forced\r\ninto it. Sometimes the stone is lashed to the club, and sometimes a hole\r\nis bored in the club, and the stone driven into it. This kind of club,\r\nmade of a sort of rosewood, may be found among some of the tribes\r\ninhabiting the district of the Essequibo.\r\n\r\nThe next improvement was to make the weapon entirely of metal, and such\r\nclubs are plentiful in every good collection of arms. There was, for\r\nexample, the common mace, which was used for the purpose of stunning an\r\nadversary clothed in armour which the sword could not penetrate. As\r\nthis, however, was nothing more than an ordinary wooden club executed in\r\niron, we need not produce examples.\r\n\r\nOther and more complicated forms were soon made, and were wonderfully\r\nvaluable until the rapidly improving firearms kept combatants at a\r\ndistance, and rendered a hand-to-hand fight almost impossible.\r\n\r\nThree examples of such clubs are given in the illustration, and are\r\ntaken from Demmin’s valuable work called “Weapons of War.”\r\n\r\nThe upper left-hand specimen is called Morgenstern, _i.e._ Morning Star.\r\nIt is a large, heavy wooden ball studded with steel spikes, and affixed\r\nto a handle usually some six or seven feet, but sometimes exceeding\r\neleven feet, in length. It was chiefly used by infantry when attacking\r\ncavalry, the long shaft enabling the foot-soldier to be tolerably sure\r\nof dealing the cavalier or his horse a severe blow, while himself out of\r\nreach of the latter’s sword.\r\n\r\nBehind it is another Morgenstern in which there is an improvement, the\r\narmed ball being furnished at the end with a spike, so that it could be\r\nused either as a mace or a spear.\r\n\r\nThe commonest form of the Morning Star is shown below, and is thus\r\ndescribed by Demmin:--\r\n\r\n“This mace had generally a long handle, and its head bristled with\r\nwooden or iron points. It was common among the ancients, for many\r\nmuseums possess several fragments of these weapons belonging to the age\r\nof bronze.\r\n\r\n“The Morning Star was very well known and much used in Germany and\r\nSwitzerland. It received its name from the ominous jest of wishing the\r\nenemy ‘good morning’ with the Morning Star when they had been surprised\r\nin camp or city.\r\n\r\n“This weapon became very popular on account of the facility and\r\nquickness with which it could be manufactured. The peasants made it\r\neasily with the trunk of a small shrub and a handful of large nails. It\r\nwas also in great request during the wars of the peasantry which have\r\ndevastated Germany at different times, and the Swiss arsenals possess\r\ngreat numbers of them.”\r\n\r\nOne of these primitive weapons may be seen in the lower figure of the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nSometimes the spiked ball was attached to a chain, and fastened to the\r\nend of a handle varying greatly in length, measuring from two to ten\r\nfeet. One of these weapons may be seen in the Guildhall of London, being\r\nheld by one of the celebrated giants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIF the reader will now turn to the illustration on page 53, he will see\r\nthat on the right of the Durian there are two spherical objects covered\r\nwith spikes. The upper is the pollen of the Hollyhock, and the lower the\r\ncommon Horse-chestnut. The reader will see that these are precisely\r\nsimilar in form to the spiked balls of the Morgenstern, whether they be\r\nused at the end of a staff or slung to a chain. There are many similar\r\nexamples in the vegetable kingdom which will doubtless suggest\r\nthemselves to the reader, but these are amply sufficient for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThen, in the animal world, the curious Diodons, sometimes called\r\nUrchin-fishes, or Prickly Globe-fishes, are good examples. These fishes\r\nare covered with sharp spines, and, as they have the power of swelling\r\ntheir bodies into a globular form, the spikes project on all sides just\r\nlike those of the pollen or chestnut. There is a specimen in my\r\ncollection, which, if the tail and fins were removed, and a cast taken\r\nin metal, would make a very good Morgenstern ball.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWORD.\r\n\r\nThe next improvement on the club was evidently to flatten it, and\r\nsharpen one or both edges, so as to make it a cutting as well as a\r\nstunning implement--in fact, the club was changed into a SWORD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWORD-GRASS MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHARK-TOOTH SWORD OF MANGAIA.]\r\n\r\nA good example of this weapon in its simplest form is the wooden sword\r\nof Australia, now an exceedingly rare weapon. It looks like a very large\r\nboomerang, but is nearly straight, and is made from the hard, tough wood\r\nof the gum-tree. Travellers say that the natives can cut off a man’s\r\nhead with this very simple weapon.\r\n\r\nI just missed obtaining one of these swords from a man-of-war, but,\r\nunfortunately, a few hours before my arrival the zealous first\r\nlieutenant had ordered a large collection of savage weapons to be thrown\r\noverboard, among which were several Australian swords.\r\n\r\nFinding that the edges were not sufficiently sharp, and were liable to\r\nbreak, the maker next turned his attention to arming them with some\r\nsubstance harder than wood. Various materials were used for this\r\npurpose, some of which will be mentioned.\r\n\r\nOne of these is given in the illustration, and is taken from a specimen\r\nin my collection. It is made of wood, rather more than two feet in\r\nlength, and would in itself be an insignificant weapon but for its\r\narmature.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a number of sharks’ teeth, which are fixed along either\r\nside, and are a most formidable apparatus, each tooth cutting like a\r\nlancet-blade, and not only being very sharp, but having their edges\r\nfinely notched like the teeth of a saw. I have a series of these weapons\r\nin my collection, some being curved, some straight, and one very\r\nremarkable weapon having four blades, one straight and long blade in the\r\ncentre, and three curved and short blades springing from the handle\r\ntowards the point.\r\n\r\nOpposite the shark-tooth sword is an object which might almost be taken\r\nfor a similar weapon, but is, in fact, nothing but a common grass-blade,\r\nsuch as may be found in any of our lanes. I suppose that most of my\r\nreaders must at some time have cut their fingers with grass, and the\r\nreason why is shown in the illustration, which represents a\r\nmuch-magnified blade of grass. The edges of the leaf are armed with\r\nsharp teeth of flint, set exactly like those of the sword, with their\r\npoints directed towards the tip of the blade. The whole of the under\r\nsurface of the blade is thickly set with similar but smaller teeth,\r\narranged in the same manner. I have just brought a blade of grass from a\r\nlane near my house, and when it was placed under the half-inch power of\r\nthe microscope, the resemblance to the sword was absolutely startling to\r\nsome spectators who came to look at it.\r\n\r\nAs if to make the resemblance closer, many savage weapons are edged with\r\nflat stones, flint chips, or pieces of obsidian, so that the flint teeth\r\nof the grass are exactly copied by the flint edgings of the sword. The\r\nold Mexican swords were nearly all edged with obsidian, as is seen in\r\nthe lower right-hand figure of the next illustration. I possess a number\r\nof obsidian flakes which were intended for that purpose, but do not\r\nappear to have been used.\r\n\r\nThe second figure from the top represents the head of a spear similarly\r\narmed, and I possess a small Australian implement in which the flakes of\r\nobsidian are set only on one side, so that the instrument can be used as\r\na rude saw.\r\n\r\nBetween these two weapons is a spear-head armed with shark-teeth. I have\r\na very remarkable weapon of this kind, made in Mangaia. It is eleven\r\nfeet in length, and, besides being armed with a double row of sharks’\r\nteeth nearly to the handle, it has three curved blades similarly armed,\r\nset at distances of about two feet, and projecting at right angles.\r\nThus, if the foe were missed with the point of the spear, he would\r\nprobably be wounded by one of the blades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWORD-GRASS. LEECH JAW. SAW-FISH].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPEARS AND SWORD ARMED WITH OBSIDIAN AND SHARKS’ TEETH.]\r\n\r\nThe upper figure represents a weapon where the natural bone of the\r\nsting-ray has been used as the point.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side are seen three natural objects similarly armed. The\r\nuppermost is another species of sword-grass, like that which has already\r\nbeen described.\r\n\r\nNext comes a magnified view of one of the three cutting instruments of\r\nthe leech, showing the serrated teeth set along its edge, by means of\r\nwhich it produces the sharply-cut wounds through which it sucks the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe last figure represents the head of the common Saw-fish, in which a\r\nvast number of flat and sharply-edged teeth are set upon the blade-like\r\nhead. The fish has been observed to use this weapon just as the Mangaian\r\nuses his sword-spear. It dashes among a shoal of fish, sweeps its head\r\nviolently backwards and forwards, and then, after they have dispersed,\r\npicks up at its leisure the dead and disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPEAR AND THE DAGGER.\r\n\r\nIt is tolerably evident that the invention of the spear and dagger must\r\nhave been nearly, if not quite, contemporaneous with that of the club. I\r\nplace these weapons together because there is great difficulty in\r\nassigning to either of them the precedence, the spear being but a more\r\nor less elongated dagger, and the dagger a shortened spear.\r\n\r\nAs a good example of this fact, I have in my collection a number of\r\nspears and daggers belonging to the Fan tribe of Western Africa. In\r\nevery case the weapons correspond so closely with each other, that if\r\nthe daggers were attached to shafts they would exactly resemble the\r\nspears, and if the spears were cut off within a few inches of the head,\r\nthey would be taken for daggers.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that as this part of the subject merely involves the\r\nemployment of a pointed or thrusting weapon, instead of the club or\r\nsword, both of which are used for striking, the question of poison,\r\nbarbs, and sheaths will be treated on another page.\r\n\r\nThe primary origin of the Spear is probably the thorn, as a savage who\r\nhad been wounded by a thorn would easily pass to the conclusion that a\r\nthorn of larger size would enable him to kill an enemy in war, or an\r\nanimal in hunting. Anything of sufficient dimensions, which either\r\npossessed a natural point or could be sharpened into a point, would be\r\navailable for the purpose of the hunter or warrior.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find that such objects as the beak of the heron or stork,\r\nthe sharp hind-claw of the kangaroo, the bone of the sting-ray, the beak\r\nof the sword-fish, and many similar objects, are employed for the heads\r\nof spears, or used simply as daggers.\r\n\r\nAs to artificial spears, nothing is easier than to scrape a stick to a\r\npoint, and then, if needful, to harden it in the fire. This is, indeed,\r\none of the commonest forms of primitive spears, and I have in my\r\ncollection many examples of such weapons. Another simple form of this\r\nweapon is that which is made by cutting a stick or similar object\r\ndiagonally.\r\n\r\nHollow rods--such, for example, as the bamboo--are the best for this\r\npurpose. I have now before me a cast of a most interesting weapon\r\ndiscovered by Colonel Lane Fox. It is the head of a spear, and is formed\r\nfrom part of the leg-bone of a sheep. At one end there is a simple round\r\nhole, which acted as a socket for the reception of the shaft, and the\r\nother end is cut away diagonally, so as to leave a tolerably sharp\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAs to the bamboo, it has a great advantage in the thinness of its walls,\r\nand the coating of flinty substance with which it is surrounded, and\r\nwhich gives its edges a knife-like sharpness. Indeed, so very sharp is\r\nthe silex, that splinters of bamboo are still used as knives, and with\r\nthem a skilful operator can cut up a large hog as expeditiously as one\r\nof our pork-butchers could do with the best knife that Sheffield\r\nproduces.\r\n\r\nI possess several of these weapons, and formidable arms of offence they\r\nare. If the reader can imagine to himself a toothpick, a foot or more in\r\nlength, made from bamboo instead of quill, and having its edges nearly\r\nas sharp as a razor, he can realise the force of even so simple a\r\nweapon. In the case of the bamboo, too, celerity of manufacture has its\r\nvalue, for any one can make a couple of spears in less than as many\r\nminutes. All he has to do is to cut down a joint of bamboo transversely,\r\nand then with a diagonal blow of his knife at the other end to form the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe force of such a weapon may be inferred from a remarkable combat that\r\ntook place some sixty years ago, when the roads were not so safe as they\r\nare at present.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, who happened to be a consummate master of the sword, was\r\ngoing along the highway at night, and was attacked by two footpads, he\r\nhaving no weapon but a bamboo cane.\r\n\r\nOne of them he temporarily disabled by a severe kick, and then turned to\r\nthe other, whom he found to be pretty well as good a swordsman as\r\nhimself, and to possess a good stick instead of a slight cane. The\r\nfootpad soon discovered the discrepancy of weapons, and with a sharp\r\nblow smashed the cane to pieces, leaving only about eighteen inches in\r\nhis antagonist’s hand.\r\n\r\nAlmost instinctively Baron ---- sprang under the man’s guard, and dashed\r\nthe broken cane in his face. The footpad staggered with a groan, put his\r\nhands to his face, and ran away, followed by his companion, who did not\r\ndesire another encounter with such an antagonist. When the victor\r\nreached his destination, he found that the footpad’s face must have been\r\ntorn to pieces, for the clefts of the split bamboo were full of scraps\r\nof skin, flesh, and whisker hair.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that the combination of the club and the dagger\r\nis common to savage and civilised life, as may be seen by reference to\r\nthe illustration in page 53, where the wooden club of savage warfare and\r\nthe metal club and maces of civilisation are alike armed with a piercing\r\nas well as a bruising apparatus. Mostly the dagger is on the head of the\r\nmace or battle-axe, but, in some cases, the end of the handle acts as\r\nthe dagger, and the head as the axe or mace.\r\n\r\nA very good example of this formation is found in the wooden battle-axe,\r\nor “Patoo,” of New Zealand, a weapon which has been long superseded by\r\nmodern fire-arms. A specimen in my possession is rather more than five\r\nfeet in length. The head is just like that of an ordinary axe, while the\r\nhandle tapers gradually to the end, where it terminates in a sharp\r\nspike. In actual combat the point was used much more than the axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AND HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPOISON, ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE.--PRINCIPLE OF THE BARB.\r\n\r\n     Poison as applied to Weapons.--Its limited Use.--Animal and\r\n     Vegetable Poisons.--Animal Poisons.--The Malayan Dagger, or Kris,\r\n     and two Modes of poisoning it.--The Bosjesmans and their\r\n     Arrows.--Snake Poison and its Preparation.--The Pseudo-barb.--The\r\n     Poison-grub, or N’gwa.--Simple Mode of Preparation, and its\r\n     terrible Effects.--Vegetable Poisons.--The Upas of Malacca.--The\r\n     Wourali Poison of Tropical America.--Mode of preparing the various\r\n     Arrows.--The Fan Tribe of West Africa, and their poisoned\r\n     Arrows.--Subcutaneous Injection.--Examples in Nature.--The\r\n     Poison-fang of the Serpent.--Sting of the Bee.--Tail of the\r\n     Scorpion.--Fang of the Spider.--Sting of the Nettle.--Exotic\r\n     Nettles and their Effects.--The Barb and its Developments.--The\r\n     “Bunday” of Java.--Reversed Barbs of Western Africa.--Tongans and\r\n     their Spears.--The Harpoon and Lernentoma, or Sprat-sucker.--The\r\n     Main Gauche, or Brise-épée.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother advance, if it may so be called, lay in increasing the deadly\r\neffect of the weapons by arming them with poison.\r\n\r\nWithout the poison, it was necessary to inflict wounds which in\r\nthemselves were mortal; but with it a comparatively slight wound would\r\nsuffice for death, providing only that the poison mixes with the blood.\r\nIt is worthy of notice that cutting weapons, such as swords and axes,\r\nseldom, if ever, have been envenomed, the poison being reserved for\r\npiercing weapons, such as the dagger, the spear, and the arrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL POISONS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most diabolical invention of this kind was the Venetian\r\nstiletto, made of glass. It came to a very sharp point, and was hollow,\r\nthe tube containing a liquid poison. When the dagger was used, it was\r\ndriven into the body of the victim, and then snapped off in the wound,\r\nso that the poison was able to have its full effect.\r\n\r\nSuch poisons are of different kinds, and invariably animal or vegetable\r\nin their origin. Taking the animal poisons first, we come to the curious\r\nmode of poisoning the Malayan dagger, or “Kris.” The blade of the weapon\r\nis not smooth, but is forged from very fibrous steel, and then laid in\r\nstrong acid until it is covered with multitudinous grooves, some of them\r\nbeing often so deep that the acid has eaten its way completely through\r\nthe blade.\r\n\r\nAmong some tribes the kris is poisoned by being thrust into a putrefying\r\nhuman body, and allowed to remain there until the grooves are filled\r\nwith the decaying matter. It is also said that if the kris be similarly\r\nplunged into the thick stem that grows just at the base of the\r\npine-apple, the result is nearly the same.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, the Arrow is generally the weapon which is poisoned,\r\nand a few examples will be mentioned of each kind of poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe two most formidable animal poisons are those which are made by the\r\nBosjesmans of Southern Africa. Their bows are but toys, and their arrows\r\nonly slender reeds. But they arm these apparently insignificant weapons\r\nwith poison so potent, that even the brave and bellicose Kafir warrior\r\ndoes not like to fight a Bosjesman, though he be protected by his\r\nenormous shield.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of animal poison used by the Bosjesmans. The first\r\nis made from the secretion of the poison-glands of the cobra,\r\npuff-adder, and cerastes. Knowing the sluggish nature of snakes in\r\ngeneral, the Bosjesman kills them in a very simple manner. He steals\r\ncautiously towards the serpent, boldly sets his foot upon its neck, and\r\ncuts off its head. The body makes a dainty feast for him, and the head\r\nis soon opened, and the poison-glands removed.\r\n\r\nBy itself, the poison would not adhere to the point of the weapon, and\r\nso it is mixed with the gummy juice of certain euphorbias, until it\r\nattains a pitch-like consistency. It is then laid thickly upon the bone\r\npoint of the arrow, and a little strip of quill is stuck into it like a\r\nbarb. The object of the quill is, that if a man, or even an animal, be\r\nwounded, and the arrow torn away, the quill remains in the wound,\r\nretaining sufficient poison to insure death. I have a quiverful of such\r\narrows in my collection.\r\n\r\nThat arrows so armed should be very terrible weapons is easily to be\r\nimagined, but there is another kind of poison which is even more to be\r\ndreaded. This is procured from the innocent-looking, but most venomous,\r\nPoison-grub. It is called N’gwa by the Bosjesmans, and is the larval\r\nstate of a small beetle. When the arrow is to be poisoned, the grub is\r\nbroken in half, and the juices squeezed upon the arrow in small spots.\r\n\r\nBoth Livingstone and Baines give full and graphic accounts of the\r\nhorrible effect produced by this dread poison, which, as soon as it\r\nmixes with the blood, drives the victim into raging madness. A lion\r\nwounded by one of these arrows has been known nearly to tear himself to\r\npieces in his agonies. M. Baines was good enough to present me with the\r\nN’gwa grub in its different stages, together with an arrow which has\r\nbeen poisoned with its juices.\r\n\r\nThe Bosjesmans are themselves so afraid of the weapon, that they always\r\ncarry the arrows with the points reversed, the poisoned end being thrust\r\ninto the hollow reed which forms the shaft of the arrow. Not until the\r\narrow is to be discharged does its owner place the tip with its point\r\nuncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE POISONS.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Vegetable Poisons, the two best known of which are\r\nthe Upas poison of Borneo, and the Wourali of South America. It is\r\nrather remarkable that in both these cases the arrows are very small,\r\nand are blown through a hollow tube, after the manner of the well-known\r\n“Puff-and-dart” toy of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Upas poison is simply the juice of the tree, and it does not retain\r\nits strength for more than a few hours after it has been placed on the\r\narrow-points. A supply of the same liquid is therefore kept in an\r\nair-tight vessel made of bamboo, the opening being closed by a large\r\nlump of wax kneaded over it at the mouth. One of these little flasks,\r\ntaken from a specimen in my collection, is seen on the extreme right of\r\nthe illustration.\r\n\r\nThe Wourali poison owes all its power to its vegetable element, though\r\ncertain animal substances are generally mixed with it. The principal\r\ningredient is the juice of one of the strychnine vines, which is\r\nextracted by boiling, and then carefully inspissated until it is about\r\nthe consistency of treacle. This poison differs from the Upas in the\r\nfact that it retains its potency after very many years, if only kept\r\ndry. I have a number of arrows poisoned with the Wourali. They were\r\ngiven to me by the late Mr. Waterton, who procured them in 1812, and\r\neven in the present year (1875) they are as deadly as when they were\r\nfirst made.\r\n\r\nA bundle of these tiny arrows, surmounted by the little wheel which is\r\nused to guard the hand from being pricked, is seen next to the Bornean\r\npoison-flask.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERPENT-FANG.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEE-STING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCORPION-STING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NETTLE-STING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIDER-FANG.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INJECTING SYRINGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POISONED ARROWS AND POISON-FLASK.]\r\n\r\nBeside these little arrows, which are only about ten inches in length,\r\nvery much larger arrows are used both for war and hunting, and are\r\npropelled by the bow, and not with the breath. Many of these arrows are\r\nnearly six feet in length. In all, the head is movable fitting quite\r\nloosely into a socket, so that when an animal is struck and springs\r\nforward, the shaft is shaken off, to be picked up by the hunter, and\r\nfitted with another point, while the poisoned head remains in the wound.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of poison, also of a vegetable origin, is used by the Fan\r\ntribe. The arrows are mere little slips of bamboo, and are propelled by\r\na slight crossbow. But the poison is so potent, that even these tiny\r\nweapons produce a fatal effect.\r\n\r\nNearly in the centre of the illustration is seen a rather curiously\r\nformed syringe, with an extremely long and slender tip. This is a\r\nrecently invented instrument, used for the purpose of subcutaneous\r\ninjection--_i.e._ of injecting any liquid under the skin. It is mostly\r\nemployed for injecting opium and other drugs of similar qualities, for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining relief from local pain. The slender spike-like\r\npoint is hollow, and ends in a sharp tip, formed like the head of a\r\nlance. Just below the head there is a little hole, communicating with\r\nthe interior of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe mode of operating is simple enough. The syringe is filled with the\r\ndrug, and the point introduced under the skin at any given spot.\r\nPressure on the piston then forces out the liquid, and causes it to mix\r\nwith the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL ANIMAL POISONS.\r\n\r\nNow, both in the animal and vegetable worlds may be found several\r\nexamples of an apparatus which acts in exactly the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe first is the poison-fang of the Serpent, a specimen of which is\r\ngiven on the left hand of the illustration. This fang answers in every\r\nrespect to the syringe above mentioned. The long and slender fang is\r\nhollow, and answers to the pipe of the syringe. It communicates at the\r\nbase with a reservoir of liquid poison, which answers to the body of the\r\nsyringe, and there is a little hole, or rather slit, just above the\r\npoint, which allows the poison to escape.\r\n\r\nWhen the serpent makes its stroke, the base of the fang is driven\r\nagainst the reservoir, so that the liquid is urged through the hollow\r\ntube, and forced into the wound. Even in large serpents these fangs are\r\nvery small. I have now before me some fangs of the cobra, puff-adder,\r\nrattlesnake, and viper, and it is astonishing how small and slender are\r\nthese most deadly weapons. The figure in the illustration is much\r\nmagnified, in order to show the aperture at the base, where\r\ncommunication is made with the interior of the fang. As the exit hole is\r\non the upper curve of the fang, it is not visible in the figure.\r\n\r\nNext to the serpent’s fang is a representation of the Bee-sting, the\r\npoisonous reservoir being seen at the base, and having attached to it\r\nthe tiny thread-like gland by which the poison is secreted.\r\n\r\nIn the centre is seen the tail of a Scorpion, with its hooked sting.\r\nThe last joint is formed just like the serpent’s fang, being hollow,\r\nhaving a sharp point with a slit near the end, and a poison reservoir in\r\nthe rounded base. When the scorpion attacks an enemy, it strikes\r\nviolently with the tail, and the force of the blow drives out the poison\r\njust as is done with the serpent’s fang.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the illustration is shown the poison-fang of a Spider,\r\nwhich, as the reader may see, is formed just on the principle of the\r\nscorpion-sting.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL VEGETABLE POISONS.\r\n\r\nSo much for animal poisons. We will now pass to the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nOf the vegetable sting-bearers none are more familiar to us than the\r\nNettle, three species of which inhabit this country. The two commonest\r\nare the Great Nettle (_Urtica diœcea_) and the Small Nettle (_Urtica\r\nurens_), and both of them are armed with venomous stings, which cause\r\nthe plants to be so much dreaded.\r\n\r\nThe structure of these stings is very simple, and can be made out with\r\nan ordinary microscope, or even a good pocket lens. Each of these stings\r\nis, in fact, a rather elaborately constructed hair, hollow throughout\r\nits length, coming to a point at the tip, and having the base swollen\r\ninto a receptacle containing the poisonous juice. When any object--such,\r\nfor example, as the human hand--touches a nettle, the points of the\r\nstings slightly penetrate the skin, and the hair is pressed downwards\r\nagainst the base, so that the poison is forced through the hole.\r\n\r\nOne of these hairs is shown in the left-hand bottom corner of the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nEven the tiny stings of our English nettles are sufficiently venomous to\r\ncause considerable pain, and, in some cases, even to affect the whole\r\nnervous system. But some of the exotic nettles are infinitely more\r\nformidable, and are, indeed, so dangerous that, when they are grown in a\r\nbotanical garden, a fence is placed round them, so as to prevent\r\nvisitors even from touching a single leaf.\r\n\r\nThe two most dreaded species are called _Urtica heterophylla_ and\r\n_Urtica crenulata_. The former is thought to be the more dangerous of\r\nthe two, and a good idea of its venomous qualities may be gathered from\r\nan account of an adventure with _Urtica crenulata_. The narrator is M.\r\nL. de la Tour.\r\n\r\n“One of the leaves slightly touched the first three fingers of my left\r\nhand; at the time I only perceived a slight pricking, to which I paid no\r\nattention. This was at seven in the morning. The pain continued to\r\nincrease, and in an hour it became intolerable; it seemed as if some one\r\nwere rubbing my fingers with a hot iron. Nevertheless, there was no\r\nremarkable appearance, neither swelling, nor pustules, nor inflammation.\r\n\r\n“The pain spread rapidly along the arm as far as the armpit. I was then\r\nseized with frequent sneezing, and with a copious running at the nose,\r\nas if I had caught a violent cold in the head. About noon I experienced\r\na painful attack of cramp at the back of the jaws, which made me fear an\r\nattack of tetanus. I then went to bed, hoping that repose would\r\nalleviate my suffering, but it did not abate. On the contrary, it\r\ncontinued nearly the whole of the following night; but I lost the\r\ncontraction of the jaws about seven in the evening.\r\n\r\n“The next morning the pain began to leave me, and I fell asleep. I\r\ncontinued to suffer for two days, and the pain returned in full force\r\nwhen I put my hand into water. I did not finally lose it for nine days.”\r\n\r\nThere is another of these formidable nettles, called in the East by a\r\nname which signifies “Devil’s Leaf,” and which is sufficiently venomous\r\nto cause death. There is but little doubt, however, that in the present\r\ninstance, if a larger portion of the body--say the whole arm--instead of\r\nthree fingers, had been stung, death would have ensued from the injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARB.\r\n\r\nWe now come to another improvement, or rather addition, in the various\r\npiercing weapons. Sometimes, as in the case of the dagger or the\r\nhand-spear, it was necessary that when a blow had been struck the weapon\r\nshould be easily withdrawn from the wound, so as not to disarm the\r\nassailant, and to enable him to repeat the stroke if needful. But in the\r\ncase of a missile weapon, such as a javelin or an arrow, it was often\r\nuseful, both in war and hunting, to form the head in such a way that\r\nwhen it had once entered it could scarcely be withdrawn. For this\r\npurpose the Barb was invented, taking different forms, according to the\r\nobject of the weapon and the nationality of the maker.\r\n\r\nAs in this work I prefer to show the gradual development of human\r\ninventions, I shall take my examples of barbs entirely from the weapons\r\nof uncivilised nations, six examples of which are given in the\r\naccompanying illustration, and five of them being drawn from specimens\r\nin my collection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARBED WEAPONS.]\r\n\r\nThe upper left-hand figure is rather a curious one, the position of the\r\nbarbs being nearly reversed, so that they serve to tear the flesh rather\r\nthan adhere to it. The opposite figure represents an arrow with a doubly\r\nbarbed point. It is chiefly used for shooting fish as they lie dozing on\r\nor near the surface of the water, but it is an effective weapon for\r\nordinary hunting purposes, and, as the shaft is fully five feet in\r\nlength, is quite formidable enough for war.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand bottom figure represents a very remarkable instrument, for\r\nit can hardly be called a weapon, and is, in fact, the head of a\r\npoliceman’s staff. It is peculiar to Java, and is called by the name of\r\n“Bunday.” As may be seen by reference to the illustration, the head of\r\nthe Bunday is formed of two diverging slips of wood. To each of these is\r\nlashed a row of long and sharp thorns, all pointing inwards, and the\r\nwhole is attached to a tolerably long shaft.\r\n\r\nWhen a prisoner is brought before the chief, a policeman stands behind\r\nhim, armed with the Bunday, and, if the man should try to escape, he is\r\nimmediately arrested by thrusting the weapon at him, so as to catch him\r\nby the waist, neck, or arm, or a leg. Escape is impossible, especially\r\nas in Java the prisoner wears nothing but his waist-cloth.\r\n\r\nA weapon formed on exactly the same principle was used in the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries, and was employed for dragging knights off\r\ntheir horses. It was of steel instead of wood, and the place of the\r\nthorns was taken by two movable barbs, working on hinges, and kept open\r\nby springs. When a thrust was made at the knight’s neck the barbs gave\r\nway, so as to allow the prongs to envelop the throat, and they then\r\nsprang back again, preventing the horseman from disengaging himself.\r\nThis weapon is technically named a “catchpoll.”\r\n\r\nAn illustration of one of these weapons will be given on another page.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand central figure is an arrow from Western Africa. In a\r\nprevious illustration (page 65) a head of one of these arrows is given\r\non rather a larger scale, so as to show the very peculiar barbs. These\r\nare of such a nature that when they have well sunk into the body they\r\ncannot be withdrawn, but must be pushed through, and drawn out on the\r\nopposite side. This is drawn from one of my own specimens.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, with an almost diabolical ingenuity, the native\r\narrow-maker has set on a couple of similar barbs, directed towards the\r\npoint, so that the weapon can neither be pushed through nor drawn back.\r\nOne of these arrows is shown in the illustration, but, for want of\r\nspace, the artist has placed the opposing barbs too near each other.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Southern Africa a similar weapon was used for securing\r\na prisoner, the barbed point being thrust down his throat and left\r\nthere. If it were pushed through the neck it killed him on the spot, and\r\nif it remained in the wound the man could not eat nor drink, and the\r\nbest thing for him was to die as soon as he could.\r\n\r\nWith similar ingenuity, the Tongans and Samoans made their war-spears\r\nwith eight or nine barbs, and, before going into action, used to cut the\r\nwood almost through between each barb, so that when the body was\r\npierced, the head, with several of the barbs, was sure to break off and\r\nleave a large portion in the wound. In Mariner’s well-known book there\r\nis an admirable account of the mode employed by a native surgeon for\r\nextracting one of these spear-heads. So common was this weapon that\r\nevery Tongan gentleman carried a many-barbed spear about five feet long,\r\nand used it either as a walking-stick or a weapon. It is needless to say\r\nthat this spear is almost an exact copy of the tail-bone of the\r\nStingray. A dagger made of this bone was used in the Pelew Islands in\r\n1780, but seemed to be rather scarce.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand central figure is a Fijian fish-spear of four points, and\r\nthe last figure on the right hand represents a large four-pronged spear\r\nof Borneo. Both these weapons are in my collection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER example of a weapon where a large and powerful barb is needful\r\nis the Harpoon. As the harpoon is used in capturing the whale, the\r\nlargest and most powerful of living mammalia, it is evident that a barb\r\nwhich will hold such a prey must be rather peculiarly made. The head and\r\npart of the shaft of the harpoon are shown in the right-hand figure of\r\nthe accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LERNENTOMA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARPOON.]\r\n\r\nThe left-hand figure represents a curious parasitic crustacean,\r\npopularly called the Sprat-sucker, because it is usually found on\r\nsprats. It affixes itself mostly to the eye, the deeply barbed head\r\nbeing introduced between the eye and the socket. In some seasons this\r\nremarkable parasite is quite plentiful, while in others scarcely a\r\nspecimen can be found. Its total length is slightly under an inch, and\r\nits scientific name is _Lernentoma Spratti_.\r\n\r\nThe following graphic account of some prototypic weapons belonging to a\r\nmarine worm is given by Mr. Rymer Jones, and is well worthy of perusal,\r\nnot only for the vividness of the description, but for its exact\r\naccuracy:--\r\n\r\n“Here is a Polynoe, a curious genus, very common under stones at low\r\nwater on our rocky shores.\r\n\r\n“It is remarkable on several accounts. All down the back we discover a\r\nset of oval or kidney-shaped plates, which are called the back-plates\r\n(_dorsal elytra_); these are flat, and are planted upon the back by\r\nlittle footstalks, set on near the margin of the under surface: they are\r\narranged in two rows, overlapping each other at the edge. These\r\nkidney-shaped shields, which can be detached with slight violence, are\r\nstudded over with little transparent oval bodies, set on short\r\nfootstalks, which are, perhaps, delicate organs of touch. The\r\nintermediate antennæ, the tentacles, and the cirrhi or filaments of the\r\nfeet, are similarly fringed with these little appendages, which resemble\r\nthe glands of certain plants, and have a most singular appearance.\r\n\r\n“If we remove the shields, we discover, on each side of the body, a row\r\nof wart-like feet, from each of which project two bundles of spines of\r\nexquisite structure. The bundles, expanding on all sides, resemble so\r\nmany sheaves of wheat, or you may more appropriately fancy you behold\r\nthe armoury of some belligerent sea-fairy, with stacks of arms enough to\r\naccoutre a numerous host.\r\n\r\n“But, if you look closely at the weapons themselves, they rather\r\nresemble those which we are accustomed to wonder at in missionary\r\nmuseums,--the arms of some ingenious but barbarous people from the South\r\nSea Islands,--than such as are used in civilised warfare. Here are long\r\nlances, made like scythe-blades, set on a staff, with a hook on the tip,\r\nas if to capture the fleeing foe, and bring him within reach of the\r\nblade. Among them are others of similar shape, but with the edge cut\r\ninto delicate slanting notches, which run along the sides of the blade\r\nlike those on the edge of our reaping-hooks.\r\n\r\n“These are chiefly the weapons of the lower bundle; those of the upper\r\nare still more imposing. The outermost are short curved clubs, armed\r\nwith a row of shark’s teeth to make them more fatal; these surround a\r\ncluster of spears, the long heads of which are furnished with a double\r\nrow of the same appendages, and lengthened scimitars, the curved edges\r\nof which are cut into teeth like a saw.\r\n\r\n“Though a stranger might think I had drawn copiously on my fancy for\r\nthis description, I am sure, with your eye upon what is on the stage of\r\nthe microscope at this moment, you will acknowledge that the\r\nresemblances are not at all forced or unnatural. To add to the effect,\r\nimagine that all these weapons are forged out of the clearest glass\r\ninstead of steel; that the larger bundles may contain about fifty, and\r\nthe smaller half as many each; that there are four bundles upon every\r\nsegment, and that the body is composed of twenty-five such segments, and\r\nyou will have a tolerable idea of the garniture and armature of this\r\nlittle worm, which grubs about in the mud at low-water mark.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF WASP-STING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN GAUCHE.]\r\n\r\nSomewhere between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a sort of\r\nanomalous weapon was in use, namely, a dagger, with a number of very\r\ndeep and bold barbs. It was not, however, employed for offence, but for\r\ndefence, and was used in the “rapier and dagger” mode of fighting, when\r\nthe dagger, which was held in the left hand, was employed to parry the\r\nthrusts of the rapier, which was held in the right. From the mode of\r\nholding it, the weapon was called “Main Gauche.”\r\n\r\nSometimes the blade was quite plain, and, indeed, an ordinary dagger\r\nanswered the purpose. But in most cases the Main Gauche was made for\r\nthis special purpose, and was furnished either with strong diverging\r\nprojections, or with a series of deep notches, so that the sword of the\r\nenemy might be caught in them and broken. In consequence of this use\r\nthese notched or guarded weapons were also called by the name of\r\n_Brise-épée_, or Sword-breaker.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between this weapon and the blade of a wasp’s sting can\r\nbe seen at a glance. There is another form of the _Brise-épée_ which is\r\nso strangely like the cutting apparatus of one of the saw-flies, that an\r\noutline sketch of the one would answer very well for the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AND HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPROJECTILE WEAPONS AND THE SHEATH.\r\n\r\n     Propulsive Power.--The Pea-shooter and its Powers.--An Attack\r\n     repulsed.--Clay Bullets.--Puff and Dart.--The Sumpitan of Borneo,\r\n     and its Arrows.--The Zarabatana or Pucunha of South America, and\r\n     its Arrows.--The Air-gun.--Modern Firearms.--The Chœtodon, or\r\n     Archer-fish.--The Pneumatic Railway.--The Throwing-stick and its\r\n     Powers.--Australians, Esquimaux, and New Caledonians.--Principle of\r\n     the Sheath.--Waganda Spears.--Sheathed Piercing Apparatus of the\r\n     Gnat, Flea, and Bombylius.--Indian Tulwar and Cat’s Claw.--The\r\n     Surgeon’s Lancet, and Piercing Apparatus of the Gad-fly and\r\n     Mosquito.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now take some of the analogies between Projectile Weapons of Art\r\nand Nature, selecting those in which the propulsive power is air or\r\ngases within a tube. Whether the weapon be a blow-gun, an air-gun, or a\r\nfirearm of any description, the principle is the same. We will take them\r\nin succession, choosing first those of the simplest and most primitive\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nTaking ourselves as examples, and looking upon the toys of children as\r\nprecursors of more important inventions, we find that the simplest and\r\nmost primitive of projectiles is the Pea-shooter, so familiar to all\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nInsignificant as is the little tin tube, and small as are the missiles\r\nwhich are propelled through it, the blow which can be struck by a pea\r\nproperly shot is no trifle. At college I have seen a night attack upon\r\nan undergraduate’s rooms successfully repelled by a pea-shooter made for\r\nthe nonce of a glass tube, the owner of the rooms having a taste for\r\nchemicals, and possessing a fair stock of the usual apparatus. Though\r\nthe assaulted rooms were on the top set, and the assailants began their\r\nstorming approaches below, the peas were too much for the stones,\r\ntaking stinging effect on the hands and faces, and preventing any good\r\naim being taken at the windows. Only two panes of glass were broken\r\nthrough a siege that lasted for several hours.\r\n\r\nThere is another toy which is a development of the pea-shooter, and\r\ncarries a small clay bullet instead of a pea. When the tube is quite\r\nstraight and the balls fit well, the force of this missile is very\r\ngreat, as it can be used for killing small birds. Indeed, such an\r\ninstrument is largely employed by the native hunters in procuring\r\nhumming-birds for the European market. These weapons are generally lined\r\nwith metal in this country, but a simple bamboo tube is sufficient for\r\nthe native hunters.\r\n\r\nA still further improvement occurs where the place of the bullet is\r\ntaken by a small dart or arrow, which is usually made to fit the bore by\r\nhaving a tuft of wool, or some similar substance, at the butt. The arrow\r\nis aimed at a target, and the toy is popularly known as “Puff and Dart.”\r\n\r\nWith us this apparatus is only a toy, but in several parts of the world\r\nit becomes a deadly weapon, namely, in Borneo and over a large part of\r\ntropical America. In both cases the arrows are poisoned, as has already\r\nbeen mentioned when treating of poisoned weapons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE first and best known of these weapons is the dreaded Sumpitan, or\r\nBlow-gun, of Borneo, the arrows of which are poisoned with the deadly\r\njuice of the upas-tree. Here I may as well mention that the scientific\r\nname of the upas-tree is _Antiaris toxicaria_. It belongs to a large\r\ngroup of plants, all of which have an abundance of milk-like and\r\nsometimes poisonous juice. We are most of us familiar with the old story\r\nof the upas-tree and its deadly power, and how the tree stood in a\r\nvalley, in which nothing else could live, and that condemned criminals\r\nmight compound for their inevitable fate by venturing into the valley of\r\ndeath and bringing back a flask of the dread poison. Even birds were\r\nsupposed to be unable to fly over the valley, but to fall into it, being\r\npoisoned by the exhalations of the tree.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a saying that there is no smoke without fire, and though\r\nthis account is evidently incredible, it is not altogether without\r\nfoundation. In Java, as in many other parts of the world, there are\r\nlow-lying places where carbonic acid gas exudes from the earth, and no\r\nliving creature can exist in them. Even in this country scarcely a year\r\npasses without several deaths occurring from inhalation of the same\r\nfatal gas, which has collected in some disused excavation. That there\r\nis, therefore, a deadly valley in Java may be true enough, and it is\r\nalso true that the juice of the upas-tree is poisonous when it mixes\r\nwith the blood. But the two have no connection with each other, and, so\r\nfar from the upas-tree poisoning the valley by its exhalations, it could\r\nnot exist in such an atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNow for the Sumpitan and the arrows. The former is a tube, some seven\r\nfeet in length, with a bore of about half an inch in diameter, and often\r\nelaborately inlaid with metal. I have one in which the whole of the\r\nmouthpiece is brass, and the other end of the weapon has been fitted\r\nwith a large spear-head, exactly on the principle of the bayonet.\r\n\r\nThe arrows are very slight, and, in order to make them fit the tube, are\r\nfurnished at their bases with a conical piece of soft wood. In\r\nthemselves they would be almost useless as weapons, but when the poison\r\nwith which their points are armed is fresh, these tiny arrows, of which\r\nsixty or seventy are but an ordinary handful, carry death in their\r\npoints. Though they have no great range, they are projected with much\r\nforce, and with such rapidity that they cannot be avoided, their slender\r\nshafts being almost invisible as they pass through the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE second weapon is the still more dangerous blow-gun of tropical\r\nAmerica, called Zarabatana, or Pucunha, according to the locality. Some\r\nof these tubes measure more than eleven feet in length, and through them\r\nthe arrow can be propelled with wonderful force. I have often sent an\r\narrow to a distance of a hundred yards, and with a good aim.\r\n\r\nA native, however, can send it much farther, knack, and not mere\r\ncapacity of lung, supplying the propelling power, just as it is with the\r\npea-shooter. When the arrow is properly blown through the zarabatana a\r\nsharp “pop” ought to be heard, like the sound produced by a finger\r\nforced into a thimble and quickly withdrawn, or a cork drawn from a\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\nAs to seeing the diminutive arrow in its flight, it is out of the\r\nquestion, and no agility can be of the least use in avoiding it. One of\r\nmy friends, a peculiarly sharp-sighted officer of artillery, has often\r\ntested this point, and although there was but one arrow to watch, and it\r\nwas blown in the open air, he could not see it until it either struck or\r\npassed him (of course the poisoned end was cut off). What, then, would\r\nbe the result of a number of these deadly missiles hurled out of a dense\r\nbush may easily be imagined.\r\n\r\nAn account of the poison with which these arrows are armed will be found\r\non p. 64.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE reader will please to remember that in all these cases the missile\r\nis propelled by air which is compressed by the aid of the lungs, and\r\nforced into the tube behind the bullet or arrow. Now, the AIR-GUN, which\r\nreally can be made a formidable weapon, is constructed on exactly the\r\nsame principle as the pea-shooter and the blow-guns, except that the air\r\nis compressed by the human arm instead of the human lungs. There are\r\nvarious modifications of this weapon, but in all of them air is driven\r\ninto a strong chamber by means of a forcing syringe, and is released by\r\nthe pull of the trigger, so as to drive out the missile which has been\r\nplaced in the barrel.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that the term “noiselessly destructive” weapon,\r\nas applied to the air-gun, is entirely false. I have already mentioned\r\nthat with the blow-gun of tropical America a definite explosion\r\naccompanies the flight of each arrow. The same result occurs with the\r\nair-gun, the loudness of the report being in exact proportion to the\r\nforce of the air, each successive report becoming slighter and the\r\npropulsive power weaker until a new supply of air is forced into the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOWEVER dissimilar in appearance may be the cannon, rifle, pistol, or\r\nany other firearm, to the pea-shooter and its kin, the principle is\r\nexactly the same in all. It has been already mentioned that in the\r\nblow-guns the air is compressed by the exertion of human lungs, and in\r\nthe air-gun the compression is achieved by human hands.\r\n\r\nBut with the firearm a vast volume of expansible gas is kept locked up\r\nin the form of gunpowder, gun-cotton, fulminating silver, or other\r\nexplosive compound, and is let loose, when wanted, by the aid of fire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHŒTODON, OR ARCHER-FISH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOW-GUNS--CANNON.]\r\n\r\nIn the illustration are represented on the right hand the blow-guns of\r\nAmerica and Borneo, and below them is the cannon as at present made. On\r\nthe left hand of the same illustration is seen a representation of a\r\nnatural gun which has existed for thousands of years before gunpowder\r\nwas invented, and very long before the savage of Borneo or America\r\ndiscovered the blow-gun.\r\n\r\nIt is the ARCHER-FISH (_Chœtodon_), which possesses the curious power\r\nof feeding itself by shooting drops of water at flies, and very seldom\r\nfailing to secure its prey.\r\n\r\nThere are several species of this very curious fish spread over the\r\nwarmer parts of the world, and their remarkable mode of obtaining prey\r\nis very well known in all. There is, indeed, scarcely any phenomenon in\r\nNature more remarkable than the fact of a fish being able to shoot a fly\r\nwith a drop of water projected through its tubular beak, if we may use\r\nthat expression for so curiously modified a mouth.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so certain is the fish of its aim, that in Japan it is kept as a\r\npet in glass vases, just as we keep gold fish in England, and is fed by\r\nholding flies or other insects to it on the end of a rod a few inches\r\nabove the surface of the water. The fish is sure to see the insect, and\r\nequally sure to bring it down with a drop of water propelled through its\r\nbeak.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the same principle was once, though\r\nunsuccessfully, employed in the propulsion of carriages, under the name\r\nof the Pneumatic Railway. Some of my readers may remember the railway\r\nitself, or at all events the disused tubes which lay for so many years\r\nalong the Croydon Railway. Speed was obtained, as I can testify from\r\npersonal experience, but the expense of air-pumps and air-tight tubing\r\nwas too great to be covered by the income, especially as the rats ate\r\nthe oiled leather which covered the valves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI FIND some little difficulty in arranging the subject which comes next\r\nin order. It might very properly be ranked among the Levers, which will\r\nbe treated of in another chapter; or it might be placed among the\r\nexamples of centrifugal force, together with the sling, the “governor”\r\nof the steam-engine, &c., all of which will be more fully described in\r\ntheir places. However, as we are on the subject of Projectiles, we may\r\nas well take it in the present place.\r\n\r\nIt is the THROWING-STICK, by which the power of the human arm is\r\nenormously increased, when a spear is to be hurled. Perhaps the most\r\nexpert spear-throwers in the world are to be found among the Kafir\r\ntribes of Southern Africa, and yet the most experienced among them could\r\nnot make sure of hitting a man at any distance above thirty or forty\r\nyards. But the throwing-stick gives nearly double the range, and I have\r\nseen the comparatively slight and feeble Australian hurl a spear to a\r\ndistance of a hundred yards, and with an aim as perfect as that of a\r\nKafir at one-fourth of the distance.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which this feat is performed is shown in the accompanying\r\ndiagram. Instead of holding the spear itself, the native furnishes\r\nhimself with a “Throwing-stick.” This weapon varies greatly in shape and\r\nsize, but a very good idea of its form, and the manner of using it, may\r\nbe obtained from the accompanying illustration, which was drawn from the\r\nactual specimen as held by an Australian native.\r\n\r\nThe throwing-stick is armed at the tip with a short spike, which fits\r\ninto a little hole in the but of the spear. The stick and spear being\r\nthen held as shown in the illustration, it is evident that a powerful\r\nleverage is obtained, varying according to the length of the stick. I\r\npossess several of these instruments, no two of which are alike.\r\n\r\nIt is rather remarkable that among the Esquimaux a throwing-stick is\r\nalso used, exactly similar in principle, but differing slightly in\r\nstructure, the but of the spear fitting into a hole at the end of the\r\nthrowing-stick. Wood being scarce among the Esquimaux, these\r\ninstruments are mostly made of bone. I possess one, however, which is\r\nmade of wood, beautifully polished, and adorned with a large blue stone,\r\nsomething like a turquoise, set almost in its middle. One of the most\r\ncurious points in the formation of the Esquimaux weapon is, that the but\r\nis grooved and channelled so as to admit the fingers and thumb of the\r\nright hand. The average length of this instrument is twenty inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAW OF SNAKE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THROWING-STICK.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN New Caledonia the natives use a contrivance for increasing the power\r\nof the spear, which is based on exactly identical principles, though the\r\nmode of carrying them out is different. A thong or cord of some eighteen\r\ninches in length is kept in the right hand, one end being looped over\r\nthe forefinger, and the other, which is terminated by a button, being\r\ntwisted round the shaft of the spear. When the weapon is thrown, the\r\nadditional leverage gives it great power; and it is a noteworthy fact\r\nthat the sling-spear of New Caledonia has enabled us to understand the\r\notherwise unintelligible “amentum” of the ancient classic writers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSING from Art to Nature, we have in the jaw of the serpent an exact\r\ntype of the peculiar leverage by which the spear is thrown. If the\r\nreader will refer to the illustration, he will see that the lower jaw of\r\nthe snake, instead of being set directly on the upper jaw, is attached\r\nto an elongated bone, which gives the additional leverage which is\r\nneedful in the act of swallowing prey, after the manner of serpents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN War and in Peace we have been long accustomed to shield the edges and\r\npoints of our sharp weapons with sheaths, and even the very savages have\r\nbeen driven to this device. I have in my collection a number of\r\nsheathed weapons from nearly all parts of the world, and it is a\r\nremarkable fact that the Fan tribe, who are themselves absolutely naked,\r\nsheathe their daggers and axes as carefully as we sheathe our swords and\r\nbayonets. In some points, indeed, they go beyond us; for the most\r\nignorant Fan savage would never think of blunting the edge of his weapon\r\nby sheathing it in a metal scabbard. Their sheaths are beautifully made\r\nof two flat pieces of wood, just sufficiently hollowed to allow the\r\nblade to lie between them, and bound together with various substances.\r\nFor example, the sheaths of one or two daggers in my possession are made\r\nof wood covered with snake-skin, while others are simply wood bound with\r\na sort of rattan. Even the curious missile-axe which the Fan warrior\r\nuses with such power is covered with a sheath when not in actual use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPIERCING APPARATUS AND SHEATHS.       SHEATHED SPEARS OF WAGANDA.\r\nGNAT.       FLEA.      BOMBYLIUS.]\r\n\r\nThe figure on the right hand of the illustration represents the heads of\r\ntwo spears of Waganda warriors. When they present themselves before\r\ntheir king, the warriors must not appear without their weapons, and it\r\nwould be contrary to all etiquette to show a bare blade except in\r\naction. The sheath can be slipped off in a moment, but there it is, and\r\nany man who dared to appear before his sovereign without his weapon, or\r\nwith an unsheathed spear, would lose his life on the spot, so exact is\r\nthe code of etiquette among these savages.\r\n\r\nThe sheathed spears of Nature are shown in the same illustration. On the\r\nleft is a side view of the piercing apparatus of the common Gnat.\r\n\r\nIn the middle is the compound piercing apparatus of the common Flea,\r\nwith which we are sometimes too well acquainted, the upper figure\r\nshowing the lancets and sheaths together, and the lower exhibiting them\r\nwhen separated.\r\n\r\nOn the right is shown the group of mouth-lancets belonging to one of the\r\nHumble-bee flies (_Bombylius_). These flies do not suck blood like the\r\nMosquito, the Flea, and the Gad-fly, but they use the long proboscis for\r\nsucking the sweet juices out of flowers, and in consequence it is nearly\r\nof the same form as if it were meant for sucking blood. Indeed, there\r\nare some insects which do not seem to care very much whether the juice\r\nwhich they suck is animal or vegetable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8 CLAW.--SHEATH OPENING ALONG THE CURVED BACK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN TULWAR.--SHEATH OPENING ALONG THE CURVED BACK.]\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration is seen an Indian sword, or\r\n“Tulwar,” drawn from one of my own specimens. I have selected this\r\nexample on account of the structure of the sheath. It is evident, from\r\nthe form of the blade, that the sword cannot be sheathed point foremost,\r\nand that therefore some other plan must be used. In this weapon the\r\nsheath is left open on one side, the two portions being held together by\r\nthe straps which are shown in the figure. Of course there is loss of\r\ntime in sheathing and drawing such a sword, but the peculiar shape of\r\nthe blade entails a necessity for a special scabbard.\r\n\r\nOn the other side is shown one of the fore-claws of a cat, which, as we\r\nall know, can be drawn back into its simple sheath between the toes,\r\nwhen it is not in use. This sheath is exactly the same in principle as\r\nthat of the Indian tulwar, and any one can examine it by looking at the\r\nfoot of a good-tempered cat. I have done so even with a chetah, which is\r\nnot a subject that would generally be chosen for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the next illustration is shown an ordinary Lancet, in which the blade\r\nis guarded between a double sheath, the two halves and the blade itself\r\nworking upon a common pivot. As for the ordinary sword and dagger\r\nsheaths, it is not worth while to figure them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTURNING to the opposite side of the illustration, we shall see a few of\r\nthe innumerable examples in which the principle of the sheath was\r\ncarried out in Nature long before man came on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe reader should compare this figure with the side view of the Gnat’s\r\nlancets given on p. 81.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANCETS OF TABANUS\r\n\r\nCLOSED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANCETS OF MOSQUITO\r\n\r\nPARTLY OPEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURGEON’S LANCET\r\n\r\nPARTLY OPEN.]\r\n\r\nThey represent the cutting and piercing instruments of several insects,\r\nall of which are very complicated, and are sheathed after the manner of\r\nthe lancet. Indeed, they are popularly known as “mouth-lancets,” and\r\nwith reason, as the reader may see by reference to the illustration.\r\n\r\nOn the extreme left are shown the head and closed lancets of a foreign\r\nGad-fly, the lancets being all in their sheaths, and showing the\r\ncharacter of the weapon which enables a small fly to be master, or\r\nrather mistress, of the forest. I say mistress, because in all these\r\ncases it is the female alone that possesses these instruments of\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nNext it is a magnified representation of the lancets of the common\r\nMosquito, as seen from above, both lancets being removed from their\r\nsheaths and separated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AND HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     The Net, as used in Hunting and War.--The Seine-net, as used for\r\n     Fishing.--Also as a means of Hunting.--Net for\r\n     Elephant-catching.--Steel Net for Military Purposes.--Web of the\r\n     Garden Spider.--The Casting-net, as used in Fishing.--Also as\r\n     employed in the Combats of the ancient Circus.--Various Kinds of\r\n     Casting-nets.--The Argus Star-fish and the Barnacle.--The Rod and\r\n     Line.--Angling of various Kinds.--The Polynesian as an Angler.--The\r\n     Angler-fish.--“Playing” a Fish.--The Nemertes and its Mode of\r\n     Feeding.--Mr. Kingsley’s Account of it.--Power of Elongation and\r\n     Contraction.--The Cydippe.--Spring-traps.--The Gin, Rat-trap, and\r\n     Man-trap.--Jaws of Dolphin, Porpoise, and Alligator.--Legs of\r\n     Phasma.--Baited Traps.--Carnivorous Plants and their Mode of\r\n     Feeding.--Birdlime.--“Pegging” for Chaffinches.--Curious Mode of\r\n     Tiger-killing.--Ant-eater and its Mode of Feeding.--The\r\n     Drosera.--Web of Spider and its Structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NET.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Net is but seldom employed for the purposes of general\r\nwarfare, it was once largely used in individual combats, of which we\r\nwill presently treat. In hunting, however, especially in fishing, the\r\nNet has been in constant use, and is equally valued by savages and the\r\nmost civilised nations.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the fisheries. Even among ourselves there are so many\r\nvarieties of fishing-nets that even to enumerate them would be a work of\r\ntime. However, they are all based on one of two principles, _i.e._ the\r\nnets which are set and the nets which are thrown.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the right hand of the illustration, and at the bottom, may be seen a\r\ncommon Seine-net being “shot” in the sea. This form of net is very long\r\nin proportion to its width, some of these nets being several miles long.\r\nThe upper edge of the net is furnished with a series of cork bungs,\r\nwhich maintain it on the surface, while the lower edge has a\r\ncorresponding set of weights, which keep the net extended like a wall of\r\nmeshes. Any fish which come against this wall are, of course, arrested,\r\nand are generally caught by the gill-covers in their vain attempts to\r\nforce themselves through the meshes.\r\n\r\nWe may see representations of fishing with the seine-net in the\r\nsculptures and paintings of Egypt and Assyria; and in the Berlin Museum\r\nthere is a part of an Egyptian seine-net with the leads still upon the\r\nlower edge, and the upper edge bearing a number of large pieces of wood,\r\nwhich acted as buoys, and served the same purpose as our corks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIDER-WEB. HUNTING-NET. THE SEINE-NET.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN hunting, this plan has been adopted for many centuries, the upper\r\nedge of the net being supported on poles, and the lower fastened to the\r\nground in such a manner as to leave the net hanging in loose folds.\r\nWhile this part of the business is being completed by the servants, the\r\nhunters are forming a large semicircle, in which they enclose a number\r\nof wild beasts, which they drive into the nets or “toils” by gradually\r\ncontracting the semicircle. The ancient sculptures give us accounts of\r\nnets used in exactly this manner. There are represented the nets rolled\r\nup ready for use, and being carried on the shoulders of several\r\nattendants, who are bearing them to the field. Then there are the nets\r\nset up on their poles, and having enclosed within them a number of wild\r\nanimals, such as boars and deer.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of India, hunting with the net is one of the chief\r\namusements of their principal men, and the variety of game driven into\r\nthe toils is really surprising, and affords a magnificent sight to those\r\nwho view it for the first time. Even the tiger himself cannot leap over\r\nthe nets because they are so high, nor force his way through them,\r\nbecause their folds hang so lightly that they offer no resistance to his\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nA very simple net on similar principles is used for catching elephants.\r\nIt is formed of the long creeping plants that fling themselves in\r\ntangled masses from tree to tree. These creepers are carefully twisted\r\ninto a net-like form, without being removed from the trees, and when a\r\nsufficient space has been enclosed the elephants are driven into it. Not\r\neven their gigantic strength and tons of weight are capable of breaking\r\nthrough a barrier which, apparently slight, is as strong as if it were\r\nbuilt of the tree-trunks on which the creepers are hung.\r\n\r\nThis net is seldom used for military purposes, though I have seen one,\r\nwhich I believe still exists, and would do good service. In one of our\r\nlargest fortresses there is a subterranean corridor, through which it is\r\ndesirous that the enemy should not penetrate. One mode of defence\r\nconsists of a large net made of steel hanging loosely across it. The\r\nmeshes are about ten inches square, so that the defenders can fire from\r\ntheir loopholes through the meshes, while the assailants, even if they\r\nknew of its position, would find that nothing smaller than a field-gun\r\nwould have any effect on this formidable net.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE natural analogy of the fixed net is evidently the web of the common\r\nGarden Spider, or Cross Spider (_Epeira diadema_), whose beautiful nets\r\nwe all must have admired, especially when we are wise enough to get up\r\nsufficiently early in the morning to see the webs with the dewdrops\r\nglittering on them.\r\n\r\nLast year there was a wonderful sight. Within a mile of my house there\r\nis a long iron fence, which in one night had been covered with the webs\r\nof the garden spider. The following morning, though bright, was chilly,\r\nso that the dewdrops were untouched. I happened to pass by the fence\r\nsoon after sunrise, and was greatly struck with the astonishing effects\r\nwhich could be produced with such simple materials as water and web. The\r\ndewdrops were set at regular intervals upon the web, so as to produce a\r\ndefinite and beautiful pattern, the whole line of fence looking as if\r\nit had been woven in fine lace.\r\n\r\nThen, as the fence runs north and south, and the path is on the westward\r\nof it, every passenger saw the rays of the rising sun dart through these\r\ntiny globules, and convert every one of them into a jewel of\r\never-changing colours. It seemed a pity that such beauty could but last\r\nfor an hour or so, or that these exquisite webs should only be used for\r\ncatching flies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT comes the Casting-net in its various forms. This net is mostly\r\ncircular, and is loaded round the edge with small leaden plummets. It is\r\nevident that, if such a net could be laid quite flat upon the water, it\r\nwould assume a dome-like shape, in consequence of the circumference\r\nbeing heavier than the centre, and would sink to the bottom, enclosing\r\nanything which came within its scope.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is to place the net in such a manner, and this is\r\naccomplished by throwing it in a very peculiar way. The net is gathered\r\nin folds upon the shoulder, which it partially envelops. By a sudden\r\njerk the thrower causes it to fly open with a sort of spinning movement,\r\nand when well cast it will fall on the water perfectly flat.\r\n\r\nAfter allowing it to sink to the bottom, the fisherman draws it very\r\ngently by a cord attached to its middle. As he raises it the weights of\r\nthe leaded circumference are drawn nearer and nearer together by their\r\nown weight, and finally form it into a bag, within which are all the\r\nliving creatures which it has enclosed.\r\n\r\nThough the Casting-net has never been used in warfare, it was one of the\r\nfavourite implements in gladiatorial combats among the Romans. Two men\r\nwere opposed to each other; one, called the Retiarius or Netsman, being\r\nquite naked, except sometimes a slight covering round the waist, and\r\narmed with nothing but a Casting-net and a slight trident, which could\r\nnot inflict a deadly wound. The other, called the Secutor or Follower,\r\nfrom his mode of fighting, was armed with a visored helmet, a broad\r\nmetal belt, and armour for the legs and arms. He also carried a shield\r\nlarge enough to protect the upper part of the body, and a sword. It will\r\nbe seen, therefore, how great was the power of the Casting-net, when it\r\nenabled its naked bearer to face such odds of offensive and defensive\r\narmour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARGUS STAR FISH. “FAN” OF BARNACLE. RETIARIUS.]\r\n\r\nWhen the two met in combat, the Retiarius tried to fling his net over\r\nhis adversary, and if he succeeded, the fate of the latter was sealed.\r\nEntangled in the loose meshes, he could scarcely move his limbs, while\r\nthe sharp prongs of the long-shafted trident came darting in at every\r\nexposed point, and exhausting the man with pain and loss of blood. The\r\ntrident was in itself so feeble a weapon, that if the Secutor were\r\nvanquished and condemned to death by the spectators, his antagonist\r\ncould not kill him, but had to call another Secutor to act as\r\nexecutioner with his sword.\r\n\r\nShould he fail in his cast, the Retiarius drew back his net by the\r\ncentral cord, and took to flight, followed by the Secutor, who tried to\r\nwound him before he could re-fold his net upon his shoulder, ready for\r\nanother cast. It is worthy of notice that in these singular combats the\r\nnetsman seems generally to have been the victor. A Retiarius with his\r\nnet is shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nI may mention that our ordinary bird-catchers’ nets, and even the\r\nentomologist’s insect-net, are only modifications of the Casting-net.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW for Nature’s Casting-nets, two examples of which are figured, though\r\nthere are many more. These two have been selected because they are\r\nfamiliar to all naturalists.\r\n\r\nThe first is the Argus Star-fish, Basket-urchin, or Sea-basket. The\r\ninnumerable rays and their subdivisions, amounting to some eighty\r\nthousand in number, act as the meshes of the net. All the rays are\r\nflexible and under control. When the creature wishes to catch any animal\r\nfor prey, it throws its tentacles over it, just like the meshes of a\r\nnet. It then draws the tips of the rays together, just as is done by the\r\ncircumference of the casting-net, and so encloses its prey effectually.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE next specimen is the net-like apparatus of the common Acorn\r\nBarnacles, with which our marine rocks are nearly covered. These curious\r\nbeings belong to the Crustacea, and the apparatus which is figured on\r\npage 89, and popularly called the “fan,” is, in fact, a combination of\r\nthe legs and their appendages of bristles, &c. When the creature is\r\nliving and covered with water, the fan is thrust out of the top of the\r\nshell, expanded as far as possible, swept through the water, closed, and\r\nthen drawn back again. With these natural casting-nets the Barnacles\r\nfeed themselves, for, being fixed to the rock, they could not in any\r\nother way supply themselves with food. There are many similar examples\r\nin Nature, but these will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROD AND LINE.\r\n\r\nThat both terrestrial and aquatic nets should have their parallels in\r\nNature is clear enough to all who have ever seen a spider’s web, or\r\nwatched the “fan” of the barnacle. But that the rod and baited line, as\r\nwell as the net, should have existed in Nature long before man came on\r\nearth, is not so well known. Yet, as we shall presently see, not only is\r\nthe bait represented in Nature, but even our inventions for “playing” a\r\npowerful fish are actually surpassed.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the Bait.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all traps a bait of some kind is required, in order to attract\r\nthe prey, and when we come from land to attract the dwellers in water to\r\nour hooks, it is needful that bait of some kind should be used, were it\r\nonly to deceive the eye, though not the nostrils or palate, of the fish.\r\n\r\nA notable example of the deception is given in the common artificial\r\nbaits of the present day, which are made to imitate almost any British\r\ninsect which a fish might be disposed to eat.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best instance of this deception is that which is practised\r\nby sundry Polynesian tribes. They have seen that the Coryphene or\r\nDorado, and other similar fish, are in the habit of preying upon the\r\nflying-fish, and springing at them when they are tolerably high in the\r\nair. So these ingenious semi-savages dress up a hook made of bone,\r\normer-shell, and other materials, making the body of it into a rudely\r\ndesigned form of a fish. A hole is bored transversely through it at the\r\nshoulders, and a bunch of stiff fibres is inserted to represent the\r\nwings. Another bunch does duty for the tail.\r\n\r\nThe imitation bait being thus complete, it is hung to a long and slender\r\nbamboo rod, which projects well beyond the stern of a canoe, and is so\r\narranged that the hook is about two feet or so from the surface. The\r\nCoryphene, seeing this object skimming along, takes it for a\r\nflying-fish, leaps at it, and is caught by the hook. There are in\r\nseveral collections specimens of these ingenious hooks, and I possess\r\none which is made on similar principles, but intended for use in the\r\nwater, and not in the air. It is, in fact, a “spoon-bait.”\r\n\r\nOne point of ingenuity must be mentioned, as it really belongs to the\r\nprinciple of the bait. These same savages, having noticed that large\r\nsea-birds are in the habit of hovering over the flying-fish, and would\r\nprobably be seen by the Coryphenes, rig up a very long bamboo rod, tie\r\nto its end a large bundle of leaves and fibres, and then fix it in the\r\nstern of the boat, the sham bird being hung some twenty feet above the\r\nsham fish. There is a refinement of deception here, for which we should\r\nscarcely give such savages their due credit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Art, then, we bait our hooks either with real or false food, and so\r\nattract the fish.\r\n\r\nIn Nature we have a most accomplished master of the art of baiting, who\r\nhas the wonderful power of never needing a renewal of his bait. A glance\r\nat the left-hand figure of the next illustration will show that I allude\r\nto the Angler-fish, sometimes called the Fishing-frog (_Lophius\r\npiscatorius_). This remarkable creature has a most enormous mouth, and\r\ncomparatively small body. On the top of its head are some curious bones,\r\nset just like a ring and staple, so as to move freely in every\r\ndirection. A figure of this piece of mechanism will be given in a\r\nfuture page. At the end of these bones are little fleshy appendages,\r\nwhich must be very tempting to most fish, which are always looking out\r\nfor something to eat. As they are being waved about, they look as if\r\nthey were alive. The fish darts at the supposed morsel, and is at once\r\nengulfed in the huge jaws of the Angler-fish, which, but for this\r\nremarkable apparatus, would be scarcely able to support existence, as it\r\nis but a sluggish swimmer, and yet needs a large supply of food. The\r\nillustration, representing on the right hand a fish attracted to a bait,\r\nand on the left, the Angler-fish, with its bait-like appendage to the\r\nhead, speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGLER-FISH. ANGLING.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSING to the art of Angling with a rod and line, we now arrive at\r\nanother development.\r\n\r\nSupposing a fish to have taken the bait, and to have been firmly hooked,\r\nhow is it to be landed? The simplest plan is, of course, to have a very\r\nthick and strong line which will not break with the weight of any\r\nordinary fish.\r\n\r\nThis is very well in sea-fishing, where a line made of whip-cord will\r\nanswer the purpose in most cases. But, in river fishing, we have the\r\nfact that the fish are so shy that a linen thread would scare them, and\r\nso strong and active, that even whip-cord would not prevent them from\r\nbreaking the line, or tearing the hook out of their mouths. So the\r\nmodern angler sets himself to the task of combating both these\r\nconditions. In the first place, he makes the last yard or two of his\r\nline of “silkworm-gut”--a curious substance made from the silk-vessels\r\nof silkworms, and nearly invisible in the water. In the next place, he\r\nhas a very elastic rod; and, in the third, he has forty or more yards of\r\nline, though perhaps only twenty feet are in actual use until the fish\r\nis hooked. The remainder of the line is wound upon a winch fixed to the\r\nhandle of the rod. Thus, when a powerful fish is hooked and tries to\r\nescape, the line is gradually let loose, so as to yield to its efforts.\r\nWhen it becomes tired by the gradual strain, the line is again wound in,\r\nand in this way a fish which would at the first effort smash rod and\r\nline of a novice will, in the hands of an experienced fisherman, be\r\nlanded as surely as if it were no bigger than a gudgeon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATURE has in this case also anticipated Art, and surpassed all her\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEMERTES. “PLAYING” A FISH.]\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful worm, common on our southern coasts, and bearing,\r\nas far as I know, no popular name. It is known to the scientific world\r\nas _Nemertes Borlasii_. It possesses the power of extension and\r\ncontraction more than any known creature, and uses those powers for the\r\npurpose of capturing prey. The fishermen say that this worm can extend\r\nitself to a length of ninety feet, and as Mr. Davis found one to measure\r\ntwenty-two feet, after being immersed in spirits of wine, it is likely\r\nthat their account may be true, especially as the spirit greatly\r\ncontracted the animal in point of length.\r\n\r\nA most vivid description of this worm is given by C. Kingsley, in his\r\n“Glaucus,” and was written before he knew its name.\r\n\r\n“Whether we were intruding or not, in turning this stone, we must pay a\r\nfine for having done so; for there lies an animal as foul and monstrous\r\nto the eye as ‘hydra, gorgon, or chimæra dire,’ and yet so wondrously\r\nfitted to its work that we must needs endure for our own instruction to\r\nhandle and to look at it. Its name I know not (though it lurks here\r\nunder every stone), and should be glad to know. It seems some very ‘low’\r\nAscarid or Planarian worm.\r\n\r\n“You see it? That black, shiny, knotted lump among the gravel, small\r\nenough to be taken up in a dessert spoon. Look now, as it is raised and\r\nits coils drawn out. Three feet, six, nine at least; with a capability\r\nof seemingly endless expansion; a slimy tape of living caoutchouc, some\r\neighth of an inch in diameter, a dark chocolate black, with paler\r\nlongitudinal lines.\r\n\r\n“Is it alive? It hangs helpless and motionless, a mere velvet string,\r\nacross the hand. Ask the neighbouring Annelids and the fry of the\r\nrock-fishes, or put it into a vase at home, and see. It lies motionless,\r\ntrailing itself among the gravel; you cannot tell where it begins or\r\nends; it may be a dead strip of seaweed, _Himanthalia lorea_, perhaps,\r\nor _Chorda filum_, or even a tarred string.\r\n\r\n“So thinks the little fish who plays over and over it, till he touches\r\nat last what is too surely a head. In an instant a bell-shaped sucker\r\nmouth has fastened to his side. In another instant, from one lip, a\r\nconcave double proboscis, just like a tapir’s (another instance of the\r\nrepetition of forms), has clasped him like a finger; and now begins the\r\nstruggle: but in vain. He is being ‘played’ with such a fishing-line as\r\nthe skill of a Wilson or a Stoddart never could invent; a living line,\r\nwith elasticity beyond that of the most delicate fly-rod, which follows\r\nevery lunge, shortening and lengthening, slipping and twining round\r\nevery piece of gravel and stem of seaweed, with a tiring drag such as no\r\nHighland wrist or step could ever bring to bear on salmon or on trout.\r\n\r\n“The victim is tired now; and slowly, and yet dexterously, his blind\r\nassailant is feeling and shifting along his side, till he reaches one\r\nend of him; and then the black lips expand, and slowly and surely the\r\ncurved finger begins packing him end foremost down into the gullet,\r\nwhere he sinks, inch by inch, till the swelling which marks his place is\r\nlost among the coils, and he is probably macerated to a pulp long before\r\nhe has reached the opposite extremity of his cave of doom.\r\n\r\n“Once safe down, the black murderer slowly contracts again into a\r\nknotted heap, and lies, like a boa with a stag inside him, motionless\r\nand blest.”\r\n\r\nThe accuracy as well as the pictorial effect of this description cannot\r\nbe surpassed. The “velvety” feel of the creature is most wonderful, as\r\nit slips and slides over and among the fingers, and makes the task of\r\ngathering it together appear quite hopeless.\r\n\r\nThis astonishing worm is drawn on the left hand of the illustration on\r\npage 93, so as to show the way in which the body is contracted or\r\nrelaxed at will. On the other side of the illustration is an angler,\r\narmed with all the paraphernalia of his craft, and doing imperfectly\r\nthat which the Nemertes does with absolute perfection.\r\n\r\nA similar property belongs to the long, trailing tentacles of the\r\nCydippe, which is described and figured on page 16. When they come in\r\ncontact with suitable prey, all struggle is useless, the tentacles\r\ncontracting or elongating to suit the circumstances, and at last lodging\r\nthe prey within the body of the Cydippe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPRING-TRAP.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the common Spring-trap, or Gin, as it is\r\nsometimes called.\r\n\r\nIt varies much in form and size, sometimes being square and sometimes\r\nround; sometimes small enough to be used as a rat-trap, and sometimes\r\nlarge enough to catch and hold human beings, in which case it was known\r\nby the name of man-trap. This latter form is now as illegal as the\r\nspring-gun, and though the advertisement “Man-traps and Spring-guns are\r\nset in these grounds” is still to be seen, neither one nor the other can\r\nbe there.\r\n\r\nThey are all constructed on the same principle, namely, a couple of\r\ntoothed jaws which are driven together by a spring, when the spring is\r\nnot controlled by a catch. They are evidently borrowed from actual jaws,\r\nthe same words being used to signify the movable portions and notches of\r\nthe trap as are employed to designate the corresponding parts in the\r\nreal jaw.\r\n\r\nIn both figures of the accompanying illustration we shall see how exact\r\nis the parallel. On the right hand is a common rat-trap, or gin, such as\r\nis sold for eightpence, with the jaws wide open, so as to show the\r\nteeth. On the left is a sketch of the upper and lower jaws of the\r\nDolphin, in which an exactly analogous structure is to be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAWS OF DOLPHIN (OPEN). RAT-TRAP (OPEN).]\r\n\r\nThe figure on the right hand of the lower illustration shows a man-trap\r\nas it appears when closed, the teeth interlocking so as exactly to fit\r\nbetween each other. The same principle is exhibited in the jaws of the\r\nPorpoise, which are seen on the left of the illustration. The jaws of an\r\nAlligator or Crocodile would have answered the purpose quite as well,\r\ninasmuch as their teeth interlock in a similar fashion, but I thought\r\nthat it would be better to give as examples the jaws of allied animals.\r\nThe reason for this interlocking is evident. All these creatures feed\r\nprincipally on fish, and this mode of constructing the jaws enables them\r\nto secure their prey when once seized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAWS OF PORPOISE (CLOSED). MAN-TRAP (CLOSED).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORE-LEGS OF PHASMA. MOUSE-TRAP.]\r\n\r\nAnother example of such teeth is to be found in the fore-legs of various\r\nspecies of Phasma and Mantis, as may be seen by reference to the\r\nillustration. The latter insects are wonderfully fierce and pugnacious,\r\nfighting with each other on the least provocation, and feeding mostly on\r\nother insects, which they secure in their deeply-toothed fore-legs.\r\nThey use these legs with wonderful force and rapidity, and it is said\r\nthat a pair of these insects fighting remind the observer of a duel with\r\nsabres.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAITED TRAP.\r\n\r\nOur space being valuable, we are not able to give many examples of\r\nBaited Traps, whether in Art or Nature.\r\n\r\nThe most familiar example of this trap is the common Mouse-trap, the\r\nmost ordinary form of which is shown at the right hand of the\r\nillustration on page 96. In all the varieties of these traps, whether\r\nfor mice or rats, the prey is induced to enter by means of some tempting\r\nfood, and then is secured or killed by the action of the trap. Sometimes\r\nthese traps are made of considerable size for catching large game, and\r\nin Africa are employed in the capture of the leopard, in India for\r\ntaking both tigers and leopards, and in North America for killing bears.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed one instance of a bait in the Angler-fish,\r\ndescribed in page 92, but in this case the bait serves only for\r\nattraction, and the trap, or mouth, is not acted upon by the prey.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many examples in the botanical world, where the\r\nplant is directly acted upon by the creature which is to be entrapped,\r\nsuch being known by the now familiar term “Carnivorous Plants.” Of these\r\nthere is a great variety, but under this head I only figure two of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CEPHALOTUS. DIONEA.]\r\n\r\nThe plant on the right hand is the Venus Fly-trap (_Dionea muscipula_),\r\nwhich is common in the Carolinas. The leaves of this plant are\r\nsingularly irritable, and when a fly or other insect alights on the\r\nopen leaf, it seems to touch a sort of spring, and the two sides of the\r\nleaf suddenly collapse and hold the insect in their grasp. The strange\r\npoint about it is, that not only is the insect caught, but is held until\r\nit is quite digested, the process being almost exactly the same as if it\r\nhad been placed in the stomach of some insect-eating animal.\r\n\r\nSo carnivorous, indeed, is the Dionea, that plants have been fed with\r\nchopped meat laid on the leaves, and have thriven wonderfully.\r\nExperiments have been tried with other substances, but the Dionea would\r\nhave nothing to do with them. The natural irritability of the leaves\r\ncaused them to contract, but they soon opened and rejected the spurious\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nOn the left is the Cephalotus. This plant, instead of catching the\r\ninsect by the folding of the leaf, secures it by means of a sort of\r\ntrap-door at the upper end. The insect is attracted by the moisture in\r\nthe cup, and, as soon as it enters, the trap-door shuts upon it, and\r\nconfines it until it is digested, when the door opens in readiness to\r\nadmit more prey.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDLIME.\r\n\r\nBy a natural transition we pass to those traps which secure their prey\r\nby means of adhesive substances.\r\n\r\nWith us, the material called “birdlime” is usually employed. This is\r\nobtained from the bark of the holly, and is of the most singular\r\ntenacity. An inexperienced person who touches birdlime is sure to repent\r\nit. The horrid stuff clings to the fingers, and the more attempts are\r\nmade to clear them, the more points of attachment are formed. The novice\r\nought to have dipped his hands in water before he touched the birdlime,\r\nand then he might have manipulated it with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe most familiar mode of using the birdlime is by “pegging” for\r\nchaffinches.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, when the male birds are all in anxious rivalry to find\r\nmates, or, having found them, to defend them, the “peggers” go into the\r\nfields armed with a pot of birdlime and a stuffed chaffinch set on a peg\r\nof wood. At one end of this peg is a sharp iron spike. They also have a\r\n“call-bird,” _i.e._ a chaffinch which has been trained to sing at a\r\ngiven signal.\r\n\r\nWhen the “peggers” hear a chaffinch which is worth taking, they feel as\r\nsure of him as if he were in their cage. They take the peg, and stick it\r\ninto the nearest tree-trunk. Round the decoy they place half-a-dozen\r\ntwigs which have been smeared with birdlime, and arrange them so that no\r\nbird flying at the decoy can avoid touching one of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nANT-BEAR.      DROSERA.      SPIDER’S WEB.\r\nPEGGING CHAFFINCHES.      TIGER AND LIMED LEAVES.]\r\n\r\nThe next point is, to order the call-bird to sing. His song is taken as\r\na personal insult by the chaffinch, which is always madly jealous at\r\nthis time of year. Seeing the stuffed bird, he takes it for a rival,\r\ndashes at it, and touches one of the twigs. It is all over with him, for\r\nthe more he struggles and flutters, the tighter is he bound by the\r\ntenacious cords of the birdlime, and is easily picked up by the\r\n“pegger.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVEN the fierce and powerful tiger is taken with this simple, but\r\nterrible means of destruction. It is always known by what path a tiger\r\nwill pass, and upon this path the native hunter lays a number of leaves\r\nsmeared with birdlime. The tiger treads on one of them, and, cat-like,\r\nshakes his paw to rid himself of it. Finding that it will not come off,\r\nhe rubs his paw on his head, transferring the leaf and lime to his face.\r\n\r\nBy this time he is in the middle of the leaves, and works himself into a\r\nparoxysm of rage and terror, finishing by blinding himself with the\r\nleaves that he has rubbed upon his head. The hunters allow him to\r\nexhaust his strength by his struggles, and then kill him, or, if\r\npossible, capture him alive.\r\n\r\nBoth these scenes are represented on the right hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand are several examples of natural birdlime, if we may use\r\nthe term. The upper represents the Ant-bear, or Great Ant-eater. This\r\nanimal feeds in a very curious manner. It goes to an ant-hill, and tears\r\nit open with its powerful claws. The ants, of course, rush about in wild\r\nconfusion. Now, the Ant-eater is provided with a long, cylindrical\r\ntongue, which looks very like a huge earth-worm, and which is covered\r\nwith a tenacious slimy secretion. As the ants run to and fro, they\r\nadhere to the tongue, and are swept into the mouth of their destroyer.\r\n\r\nBelow the Ant-eater is the common Drosera, or Sundew, one of our British\r\ncarnivorous plants. It captures insects, just as has been narrated of\r\nthe Dionea. But, instead of the leaf closing upon the insect, it arrests\r\nits prey by means of little globules of viscous fluid, which exude from\r\nthe tips of the hairs with which the surface of the leaf is covered. As\r\nsoon as the insect touches the hairs, they close over it, bind it down,\r\nand keep it there until it is digested. Several species of Drosera are\r\nknown in England, and are found in wet and marshy places.\r\n\r\nAnother plant, the Green-winged Meadow Orchis (_Orchis morio_), has been\r\nknown to act the part of the Drosera. A fly had contrived to push its\r\nhead against the viscous fluid of the stigmatic surface, and, not being\r\nable to extricate itself, was found sticking there.\r\n\r\nNext comes a portion of the web of the common Garden Spider (_Epeira\r\ndiadema_). We have already treated of this web as a net, and we will now\r\nsee how it comes within the present category.\r\n\r\nIn the web of the spider there are at least two distinct kinds of\r\nthreads. Those which radiate from the centre to the circumference are\r\nstrong and smooth, while those which unite them are much slighter, and\r\nare covered with tiny globules set at regular intervals. When the web is\r\nnewly spun, these globules are found to be nearly as tenacious as\r\nbirdlime, and it is by these means that an insect which falls into the\r\nweb is arrested, and cannot extricate itself until the spider can seize\r\nit. After awhile the globules become dry, refuse to perform their\r\noffice, and then the spider has to construct another web. So numerous\r\nare these globules that, according to Mr. Blackwall’s calculations, an\r\nordinary net contains between eighty and ninety thousand. Below the\r\nfigure of the web itself are shown the two kinds of thread, the upper\r\nbearing the globules, and the lower representing one of the plain\r\nradiating threads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AND HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     Reverted Spikes and their Modifications.--The Wire\r\n     Mouse-trap.--George III. and the Trap.--Fate of a Royal\r\n     Finger.--The Crab and Lobster Pot.--The Eel-pot.--Cocoon of the\r\n     Emperor-moth and its Structure.--“Catchpoll” of the Middle\r\n     Ages.--Deer-trap of India.--Jaws of Pike and Serpent.--The\r\n     Grass-snake.--Jaws of Shark and their Power.--Spiked Defences.--The\r\n     Park Fence, the Garden Wall, and the Chevaux-de-frise.--The\r\n     “Square” of Infantry Manœuvres.--The Abattis, and its Structure\r\n     and Power.--Ranjows and Caltrops.--Ancient Ranjows in\r\n     Ireland.--Hedgehog.--Porcupine Echidna.--House-builder Caterpillar\r\n     and its Home.--Repagula of Ascalaphus.--Tearing Weapons.--The\r\n     “Wag-nuk” of India.--Armed Gauntlet of the Middle\r\n     Ages.--Shark-tooth Gauntlet of Samoa, and the Uses to which it was\r\n     put.--A terrible Warrior.--The Tiger’s Claw.--Sport and Earnest.\r\n\r\nREVERTED SPIKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not quite satisfied with this title, but it is the best that I can\r\nfind. By it I mean that mode of mechanism which, by means of an array of\r\nsharp spikes, permits an animal to enter a passage easily, and yet\r\nprevents it from emerging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOON OF EMPEROR-MOTH. CRAB-POT. EEL-POT. MOUSE-TRAP.]\r\n\r\nWhether or not this principle be now employed in warfare I cannot say,\r\nbut it is at all events used extensively in a small way of hunting, the\r\nbest known of which is the wire Mouse-trap, one of which is shown at\r\nFig. C on the illustration. A glance at the figure will explain the\r\ntrap, even to those who have never seen it. It is composed entirely of\r\nwire, and has several round holes just above its lower edge. Each of\r\nthese holes is the entrance to a conical tunnel made of wires with\r\nsharpened ends.\r\n\r\nThe mouse, being attracted by a bait placed within the trap, tries to\r\nget at it. The doomed animal soon finds its way to one of the entrances,\r\nand with little difficulty pushes itself through the tunnel. Entering,\r\nhowever, is one thing, and returning is another. The wire yielded easily\r\nenough in one direction, but for the mouse to force itself against the\r\nconverging points is an impossible task.\r\n\r\nReaders of the last century literature may perhaps remember, in the\r\npages of “Peter Pindar,” a very clever and sarcastic account of the\r\nastonishment created in the mind of George III. by a mouse-trap seen\r\naccidentally in the house of a widow living at Salt Hill.\r\n\r\n    “Eager did Solomon, so curious, clap\r\n     His rare round optics on the widow’s trap,\r\n     That did the duty of a cat.\r\n       And, always fond of useful information,\r\n       Thus wisely spoke he with vociferation,--\r\n     ‘What’s that? what? what? Hæ, hæ? what’s that?’\r\n\r\n     To whom replied the mistress of the house,\r\n     ‘A trap, an’t please you, sir, to catch a mouse.’\r\n\r\n     ‘Mouse--catch a mouse!’ said Solomon with glee;\r\n     ‘Let’s see, let’s see--’tis comical--let’s see--\r\n     Mouse! mouse!’--then pleased his eyes began to roll--\r\n     ‘Where, where doth he go in?’ he marvelling cried.\r\n     ‘There,’ pointing to the hole, the dame replied.\r\n     ‘What! here?’ cried Solomon, ‘this hole? this hole?’\r\n     Then in he pushed his finger ’midst the wire,\r\n     That with such pains that finger did inspire,\r\n       He wished it out again with all his soul.”\r\n\r\nFor my part I think that the King was quite right. If he did not know\r\nthe philosophy of a mouse-trap he ought to have asked, and to have been\r\nrewarded, as in that case, by catching with a trap of his own baiting,\r\nsix mice on six successive days.\r\n\r\nAt Fig. B on the same illustration is shown the simple apparatus by\r\nwhich crabs and lobsters are caught. The reader will see that the\r\nprinciple is exactly the same in both cases, the only difference being\r\nin material, the mouse-trap being made of wire, and the crab-pot of\r\nwicker.\r\n\r\nAt Fig. D is shown the common Eel-pot, or Eel-basket. In order to suit\r\nthe peculiar shape of an eel, this basket is much longer in proportion\r\nto its diameter than either of the preceding traps, but it is formed on\r\nthe same plan. An eel can easily pass into the basket through the\r\nconical tunnel, but it is next to impossible that it should find its way\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSO much for Art, and now for Nature.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the illustration, at Fig. A, is the cocoon of the\r\ncommon Emperor-moth (_Saturnia pavonia minor_), the cocoon having been\r\nstripped of its outer envelope, so as to allow its structure to be\r\nbetter seen.\r\n\r\nThe reader will at once perceive that the entrance of the cocoon is\r\nguarded by an arrangement exactly like that of the above-mentioned\r\ntraps, except that the cone is reversed, so as to allow of exit and to\r\ndebar entrance. Guarded by this conical arrangement of stout bristly\r\nappendages, the pupa can remain in quiet during the time of its\r\ntransformation, for nothing can force its way through such a defence,\r\nand yet the moth, when fully developed, can push its way out with\r\nperfect ease.\r\n\r\nSo admirably is this cocoon formed, that even after the moth has\r\nescaped, it is impossible to tell by mere sight whether or not it is\r\nwithin, the elastic wires closing on it after its passage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER modification of the same principle now comes before us. In the\r\nabove-mentioned examples the arrangement of the reverted spikes is more\r\nor less conical, and they lead into a chamber. In the present instances,\r\nhowever, the mere reversion of the points is all that is needed.\r\n\r\nThe upper figure on the right hand represents the “Catchpoll” of the\r\nMiddle Ages, an allusion to which has already been made. The reverted\r\nspikes turn on hinges, and are kept apart by springs. This beautifully\r\nformed head was attached to a long shaft, and was used for the purpose\r\nof dragging horsemen from the saddle. It was thrust at the neck of the\r\nrider, generally from behind. If a successful thrust were made, the\r\nspring-points gave way, sprang back again, and thus clasped the neck\r\nwith a hold that was fatal to the rider.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW it is the Deer-trap which is used in many parts of India, and to\r\nwhich allusion has already been made. The reader will see at once that\r\nif a deer should get its foot through the converging spikes, its doom\r\nis sealed, especially as there is a heavy log of wood attached to the\r\ntrap by a rope.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration are two examples of the same\r\nprinciple taken from Nature, one belonging to fresh and the other to\r\nsalt water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIKE-JAWS. SHARK-JAWS. CATCHPOLL. DEER-TRAP.]\r\n\r\nThe upper figure represents the jaws of a Pike, with their terrible\r\narray of reverted teeth. The Pike, as every one knows, feeds upon other\r\nfish, and eats them in a curious manner. It darts at them furiously, and\r\ngenerally catches them in the middle of the body. After holding them for\r\na time, for the purpose, as I imagine, of disabling them, it loosens its\r\nhold, makes another snap, seizes the fish by the head, and swallows it.\r\n\r\nThe Pike is so voracious that it will attack and eat fish not very much\r\nsmaller than itself, for its digestion is so rapid that the head and\r\nshoulders of a swallowed fish have been found to be half digested, while\r\nthe tail was sticking out of the Pike’s mouth. Unless, therefore, the\r\nteeth of the Pike were so formed as to resist any retrograde movement on\r\nthe part of the prey, the fish would starve; for, lank and lean as it\r\nis, the Pike is one of the most voracious creatures in existence, never\r\nseeming able to get enough to eat, and yet, as is often found in such\r\ncases, capable of sustaining a lengthened fast.\r\n\r\nHow well adapted is this arrangement of teeth for preventing the escape\r\nof prey, any one can tell who, in his early days of angling, caught a\r\nPike, and, after killing it, tried to extract the hook without\r\npreviously propping the jaws open. If once the hand be inserted between\r\nthe jaws, to get it out again is almost impossible without assistance,\r\nand often has the spectacle been exhibited of a youthful angler\r\nreturning disconsolately home, with his right hand in the mouth of a\r\nPike, and supporting the weight of the fish with his left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE teeth of a serpent are set in a similar manner, as can be seen by\r\nreference to the illustration on page 80. An admirable example of the\r\npower of this arrangement may be seen in the jaws of our common Grass or\r\nRinged Snake (_Coluber natrix_). The teeth are quite small, very short,\r\nand not thicker than fine needle-points. Yet, when once the snake has\r\nseized one of the hind-feet of a frog, all efforts to escape on the part\r\nof the latter are useless. The lower jaw is pushed forward, and then\r\nretracted, and at each movement the leg is drawn further into the\r\nsnake’s mouth, until it reaches the junction.\r\n\r\nThe snake then waits quietly until the frog tries to free itself by\r\npushing with its other foot against the snake’s mouth. That foot is then\r\nseized, the leg gradually following its companion, and in this way the\r\nwhole frog is drawn into the interior of the snake. I have seen many\r\nfrogs thus eaten, but never knew one to escape after it had been once\r\nseized by the snake. As these reptiles are perfectly harmless, it is\r\neasy to try the experiment by putting the finger into a snake’s mouth,\r\nwhen it will be found that the assistance of the other hand will be\r\nneedful in order to extricate it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the head of the pike is a view of a Shark’s jaws, as seen from the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we have a similar arrangement of teeth, row after row of\r\nwhich lie with their points directed towards the throat of the fish. As,\r\nhowever, the pike and the snake swallow their prey whole, their teeth\r\nneed be nothing but points. But, as the Shark is obliged to mangle its\r\nprey, and seldom swallows it whole, its teeth are formed on a different\r\nprinciple, each tooth being flat, wide, sharply pointed, and having a\r\ndouble edge, each of which cuts like a razor. So knife-like are they,\r\nindeed, that when a whale is killed, the sharks which surround it bite\r\noff huge mouthfuls of blubber, and, as they swarm by hundreds, cause no\r\nsmall loss to the whalers.\r\n\r\nMany a man has lost a leg by a shark, the fish having bitten it\r\ncompletely through, bone and all, and there have been cases where a\r\nshark has actually severed a man’s body, going off with one half, and\r\nleaving the other clinging to the rope by which he was trying to haul\r\nhimself on board.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIKED DEFENCES.\r\n\r\nThis mode of defence is, perhaps, one of the most primitive in\r\nexistence, and takes a wonderful variety of forms. The spiked railings\r\nof our parks and gardens, the broken glass on walls, and even the spiked\r\ncollars for dogs, are all modifications of this principle.\r\n\r\nOn the illustrations are several examples of spikes used for military\r\npurposes. The first is known by the name of “Chevaux-de-frise,” and is\r\nextensively used in forming an extemporised fence where no great\r\nstrength is needed. The structure is perfectly simple, consisting of a\r\nnumber of iron bars with sharpened ends, and an iron tube some inches in\r\ndiameter, which is pierced with a double set of holes. When not in use,\r\nthe bars and tube can be packed in a small compass, but when they are\r\nwanted, the bars are thrust through the holes as shown in the\r\nillustration, and the fence is completed in a few minutes. The\r\nhorizontal bars are linked together by chains, so as to prevent them\r\nfrom being shifted, and a defence such as this is generally used for\r\nsurrounding parks of artillery and the like.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALL who have the least acquaintance with military matters must be\r\nfamiliar with the “Square,” and its uses in the days of old. I say in\r\nthe days of old, because in the present day the rapid development of\r\nguns and rifles has entirely destroyed the old arrangement. So lately,\r\nfor example, as the day of Waterloo, troops might manœuvre in safety\r\nwhen they were more than two hundred yards from the enemy. Now, a\r\nregiment that attempted to manœuvre in open ground would be cut to\r\npieces by the rifles of the enemy at a thousand yards’ distance.\r\n\r\nIn those days, however, the square was a tower of safety when rightly\r\nformed. It was formed in several rows. The outer line knelt, with the\r\nbutts of their muskets on the ground, and the bayonet pointing upwards\r\nat an angle of forty-five. The others directed their muskets towards\r\nthe enemy in such a manner that nothing was presented to him but the\r\npoints of bayonets and the muzzles of loaded muskets. In all probability\r\nthe battle of Waterloo would have been lost but for the use of the\r\n“square,” against which the French cuirassiers dashed themselves\r\nrepeatedly, but in vain.\r\n\r\nHowever admirable may be the organization of the square, whether it be\r\nhollow, or whether it be solid, like the “rallying square,” the\r\nprinciple is the same as that of the chevaux-de-frise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the next illustration is shown the “Abattis,” one of the most\r\nimportant elements of extemporised fortifications, and as simple as it\r\nis important.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREE-CADDIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE.]\r\n\r\nIn any wooded country an abattis can be made in a very short time by\r\npractised hands. All that is required is to cut down the requisite\r\nnumber of trees, strip off the leaves and twigs, and then cut off the\r\nsmaller branches with sloping blows of the axe, so as to leave a\r\ntolerably sharp point on each. The trees are then laid side by side,\r\nwith the ends of the branches towards the enemy, and, the trunks being\r\nchained together, a wonderfully effective defence is constructed.\r\n\r\nNot only is it almost impossible for the bravest and strongest man to\r\nforce his way through the branches, even if the abattis were undefended,\r\nbut the tree-trunks afford shelter for swarms of riflemen, who can pick\r\noff their assailants by aiming between the branches, themselves being\r\nalmost unseen, and entirely covered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALTROPS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RANJOWS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABATTIS.]\r\n\r\nIn Southern Africa, during the late wars, the abattis was found to\r\nafford the best defence against the Kafirs, and that when the waggons\r\nand abattis were united so as to form a fortress, not even the naked\r\nKafir, with all his daring courage, could force his way through them.\r\nEven artillery has but little power against the abattis, which allows\r\nthe shot to pass between the branches, and is very little the worse for\r\nit. Accordingly, it is in great use for defending roads, especially\r\nthose which are bounded by high banks, and makes a formidable obstacle\r\nin front of gates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE two figures on the left of the same illustration represent two modes\r\nof carrying out the same principle, the one showing it as used in\r\nEuropean warfare, and the other as a weapon of defence which has been\r\nemployed from time immemorial, and is now in full use in many parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nBoth these weapons are intended either to obstruct the approach of an\r\nenemy, or to cover the flight of a retreating force. The most simple and\r\nmost ancient is the Ranjow, which is shown on the right hand of the\r\nillustration. The ranjow is nothing but a wooden stick varying in length\r\nfrom eighteen inches to nearly three feet, and sharply pointed at each\r\nend. In Borneo, China, &c., the ranjows are almost invariably made of\r\nbamboo, as that plant can be cut to a sharp point by a single stroke of\r\na knife. (See page 59.)\r\n\r\nWhen they are to be used, each soldier carries about a dozen or so of\r\nthem, and sticks one end of them into the ground, taking care to make\r\nthe upper end lean towards the enemy. Simple as are these weapons, they\r\nare extremely formidable, for it is necessary to pull up every ranjow\r\nbefore the troops can advance. Sometimes it has happened that a body of\r\nsoldiers are driven over their own ranjows, and then the slaughter is\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a number of sketches were taken on the spot from scenes\r\nin the Chinese war. Among them was one that was absolutely terrible in\r\nits grotesqueness. It represented a piece of ground thickly planted with\r\nranjows, over which the Chinese who had fixed them had been driven. They\r\nwere simply hung with human bodies in all imaginable and unimaginable\r\nattitudes, some transfixed on a single ranjow, and others hanging on\r\nthree or four, the body and limbs being alike pierced by them.\r\n\r\nThat ranjows were once used in Great Britain is evident from a discovery\r\nmade by Col. Lane Fox. He had been excavating the soil around an old\r\nIrish fort, and deep beneath the bog he found a vast quantity of ranjows\r\nstill set as the ancient warriors had left them. They were evidently\r\nused to defend a passage leading to the fort, and all of them were\r\ncarefully set with their points outwards. Col. L. Fox was good enough to\r\npresent me with several of these ancient weapons, which are now in my\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left is seen a piece of ground strewed with Caltrops, or\r\nCrow’s-feet, as they are sometimes called. These very unpleasant\r\nimplements are made of iron, and have four sharp points, all radiating\r\nfrom one centre, so that no matter how they may be thrown, one point\r\nmust be uppermost. They are used chiefly for the purpose of impeding\r\ncavalry, but I should think, judging from the specimens which I have\r\nseen, that infantry would find them very awkward impediments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAS for natural ranjows, they are so numerous that only a very few\r\nexamples can be given.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect and most familiar example is, perhaps, the common\r\nHedgehog, which, when rolled up, displays an array of sharp points so\r\njudiciously disposed, that it fears but very few foes. The same may be\r\nsaid of the Australian Echidna, or Porcupine Ant-eater, and the\r\nPorcupine itself. Whether the radiating bristles of the larva of the\r\nTiger-moth, commonly called the Woolly Bear, come under the same\r\ncategory, I cannot say, but think it very likely.\r\n\r\nAmong vegetables the analogues are multitudinous. See, for example, the\r\nspikes of the Spanish and Horse Chestnuts, and especially the hair-like\r\nbut formidable bristles which defend the common Prickly Pear. Indeed,\r\nall that tribe of plants is furnished so abundantly with natural\r\nranjows, that a hedge of prickly pear forms the best defence which a\r\nhouse and garden can have.\r\n\r\nAnother example of natural ranjows is seen in the Tree-caddis, one of\r\nwhich is shown in the illustration on page 108, as it appears when\r\nsuspended from a twig. It is the work of one of the House-builder Moths\r\nof the West Indies, and forms a sort of house in which the caterpillar\r\ncan rest securely. It is built of bits of twigs and thorns, the latter\r\nbeing disposed so that their points are outwards, much after the fashion\r\nof a hedgehog’s spines.\r\n\r\nI possess many specimens of Tree-caddis, evidently belonging to several\r\nspecies, and in all of them the principle is the same, _i.e._ a number\r\nof spikes set with their ends outwards in order to defend a central\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nSometimes these spikes are left exposed, as shown in the illustration,\r\nand sometimes they are covered with a slight but strong web. The\r\nprinciple, however, is the same in all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW I shall have to use two very long words, and much against my will. I\r\nvery much fear that, if most of my readers were to hear any one speak of\r\nthe “repagula of Ascalaphus,” they would not be much the wiser. And yet\r\nthere are no other words that can be used.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Ascalaphus is a name belonging to a genus of\r\nAnt-lions, remarkable for having straight, knobbed antennæ, very much\r\nlike those of a butterfly. This insect deposits its eggs in a double row\r\non twigs, and then defends them with a series of natural ranjows, set in\r\ncircular rows, and supposed to be without analogies in the animal\r\ncreation. They are transparent, reddish, and “are expelled by the female\r\nwith as much care as though they were real eggs, and are so placed that\r\nnothing can approach the brood; nor can the young ramble abroad until\r\nthey have acquired strength to resist the ants and other insect\r\nenemies.”\r\n\r\nThe word “repagulum,” by the way, signifies a bar or barrier. A\r\nturnpike gate when closed would be a repagulum, and so would a\r\nchevaux-de-frise.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEARING WEAPONS.\r\n\r\nWe have already had examples of weapons, like the Club, which bruise; of\r\nweapons, like the Spear and Dagger, which pierce; and of weapons, like\r\nthe Sword, which cut. We now come to a totally distinct set of weapons,\r\nthose which wound by tearing, and not by any of the preceding modes.\r\n\r\nIn civilised warfare we have long abandoned such weapons, as belonging\r\nto a barbarous age, but they are even yet employed in some parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nWAG-NUK OF INDIA.\r\n\r\nHIND-CLAWS OF TIGER.\r\n\r\nCLAWED GAUNTLET.\r\n\r\nSHARK-TOOTH GAUNTLET.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows three examples of such weapons. One\r\nis the celebrated Tiger-claw of India, known by the native name of\r\nWag-nuk. It is about two inches and a half in length, and is made to fit\r\non the hand. The first and fourth fingers are passed through the rings,\r\nand the curved claws are then within the hand, and hidden by the\r\nfingers. The mode of employing this treacherous weapon was by engaging a\r\nfoe in conversation, pretending to be very friendly, and then ripping up\r\nhis stomach with an upward blow of the right hand.\r\n\r\nIt is comparatively a modern weapon, having been invented about two\r\nhundred years ago. A Hindoo, named Sewaja, was the inventor, and by\r\nmeans of the Wag-nuk he committed many murders unsuspected, the wounds\r\nbeing exactly like those which are made by the claw of the tiger.\r\nSometimes there were four claws instead of three, as is the case with a\r\nspecimen one in the Meyrick collection.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may be aware that the Transatlantic “knuckle-duster”\r\nis fitted on the hand in the same manner, only its object is to strike a\r\nheavy blow, and not to tear. History repeats itself, and the large and\r\nclumsy “cestus” of the ancient athlete is reproduced in the small but\r\nscarcely less formidable “knuckle-duster” of the modern rowdy.\r\n\r\nThe figures are remarkable, one representing the remaining epoch of\r\nchivalry, and the other that of barbarism. The upper figure shows a\r\ncurious Gauntlet of the Middle Ages, in which the hand is not only\r\ndefended by steel plates, but is also rendered an offensive weapon by\r\nthe addition of four sharp spikes set just at the junction of the\r\nfingers with the hand. As long as the fingers are extended the spikes\r\nlie parallel with them, and are as harmless as a cat’s claws in their\r\nsheaths. But when the fingers are closed, as shown in the illustration,\r\nthe spikes come into use, and can be made into a formidable weapon of\r\noffence, just as are the cat’s claws when protruded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the gauntlet of civilised warfare is one of savage war, which has\r\nfor many years been discontinued, partly on account of the introduction\r\nof firearms, and partly owing to the superficial coating of civilisation\r\nwhich is so easily adopted by the singular varieties of the human race\r\nwhich populate the isles where this remarkable weapon was once worn. The\r\nfigure is taken from a specimen in the United Service Museum.\r\n\r\nIt is a Gauntlet, having at one end a band through which the whole hand\r\nis passed, and at the other three loops for the fingers, just like those\r\nof the Wag-nuk, which has already been described. The body of the weapon\r\nis made of cocoa-nut fibre, and upon it are strung six rows of sharks’\r\nteeth, the tips all pointing backwards. It is a Samoan weapon, some of\r\nthe most renowned warriors never using club nor spear, but trusting\r\nentirely to their terrible gauntlets. With these they struck right and\r\nleft, dashing beneath the clubs and spears of their enemies, and always\r\ntrying to rip up their stomachs, just as is done with the Wag-nuk. In\r\norder to guard against this weapon, the Samoan warrior wears a belt of\r\ncocoa-nut fibre some eight inches wide, and thick enough to defy the\r\nbest gauntlet that could be made.\r\n\r\nOne celebrated Samoan warrior, a man of gigantic stature and strength,\r\nwas addicted to the amusement of seizing his enemies with the\r\nshark-tooth gauntlets, breaking their backs across his knee, throwing\r\nthem down, and going off after another victim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration is seen the hind-foot of the Tiger.\r\nI have chosen the hind-foot for two reasons: firstly, because the\r\nfore-foot has already been figured; and secondly, because the hind-foot\r\nis used for tearing open the abdomen of the prey. Any one who has played\r\nwith a kitten has noticed how the animal throws itself on its back,\r\nclasps the wrist with its fore-paws, and kicks vigorously with its\r\nhind-legs. It does not mean to hurt its playfellow, but the hand does\r\nnot easily escape without sundry scratches.\r\n\r\nChild’s play though it may be in the kitten, it is no play at all with\r\nthe tiger, or even the leopard, for either of these animals, when hard\r\npressed, will throw itself on its back, clasp the foe in its fore-paws,\r\nand with the talons of the hind-feet tear him to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AND HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE HOOK.--DEFENSIVE ARMOUR.--THE FORT.\r\n\r\n     Anglers and their Hooks.--Single and double Hooks.--Hook of British\r\n     Columbia.--Seed of Galium, or Goose-grass, and its Armature of\r\n     Hooks.--Seed of the Burdock, and its Annoyance to Sheep.--Hooked\r\n     Sponge-spicules.--“Snatching” Fish.--The Fish-rake of British\r\n     Columbia.--The “Gaff” and its Uses.--The Jaguar as a\r\n     Fisher--Defensive Armour and its Varieties.--Plate and Chain\r\n     Mail.--The Shield.--Australian and West African Shields.--Fibre\r\n     Armour.--Seal’s-tooth Cuirass.--Joints of\r\n     Armour.--“Tassets.”--Scale Armour in Art and Nature.--The Manis and\r\n     the Fish.--Feather Armour.--“Madoc in Aztlan.”--Quilted Armour of\r\n     Silk or Cotton.--Terrible Results from the latter.--Mr. Justice\r\n     Maulstatute.--Natural Quilt Armour.--The Rhinoceros and the\r\n     Whale.--The Testudo of the ancient Romans, and its Uses.--The\r\n     common Tortoise.--The Fort.--Curious Transitions in Fort building;\r\n     first Earth, then Stone, then Earth again.--Advantage of Earthen\r\n     Mounds.--Natural Snow-fort made by the Elk, and its Defensive\r\n     Powers against the Wolf.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOOK.\r\n\r\nHaving now seen that the rod and line of anglers have their prototypes\r\nin Nature, we will proceed to the hook, by which the fish are secured.\r\n\r\nThe two figures on the right hand of the accompanying illustration\r\nrepresent hooks which are familiar to every angler. The lower is the\r\nordinary fish-hook, which can be used in so many ways. Generally it is\r\nemployed singly, being fastened to the end of a line, and armed with a\r\nbait, either real or artificial. Sometimes, however, these hooks are\r\nwhipped together, back to back, three or even four being so employed,\r\nand thus forming a combination of the hook and grapnel, and rendering\r\nthe escape of a fish almost impossible.\r\n\r\nAbove it is a double hook, such as is used in “trolling” for pike, and\r\nwith the use of which many of my readers are probably acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe third is a singularly ingenious hook made by the natives of British\r\nColumbia. It is almost entirely made of wood, with the exception of the\r\nbarb, which is of bone. This, as the reader will see, is fixed, not to\r\nthe point of the hook, as with us, but to its base, the point being\r\ndirected towards the central portion of the curve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nHYMEDESMIA.      FRUIT OF GALIUM.      VANCOUVER HOOK.      DOUBLE AND\r\n                                                            SINGLE HOOKS.]\r\n\r\nAt first sight this seems to be a singular arrangement, but it is a very\r\neffective one, as any one may see by placing the point between the\r\nfingers and pushing it through them. It will be found impossible to\r\nforce it back again, the sharp point of the bone-barb coming against\r\nthem and retaining them.\r\n\r\nIt has also another advantage. Very large fish, for which this hook is\r\nintended, are apt in their struggles to reverse the hook, and so to\r\nweaken its hold. In this hook, however, such a proceeding is impossible;\r\nfor, even should the hook be reversed, it still retains its hold, the\r\nbarb becoming the point, and the point keeping the lip of the fish\r\nagainst the tip of the barb. The figure is drawn from a specimen in my\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIF the reader will look at the illustration, he will see a globular\r\nobject covered with little hooks. This is a magnified representation of\r\nthe seed-vessel of the common Goose-grass (_Galium_), which is so\r\nluxuriant in our hedges, and often intrudes itself into our gardens. Its\r\nlong, trailing stems, with their tightly-clinging leaves, are familiar\r\nto all, and there are few who have not, while children, pelted each\r\nother with the little round green seed-vessels during the time that the\r\nfruit is in season. That they clung so tightly as not to be removed\r\nwithout difficulty, we all knew, but we did not all know the cause. The\r\nmagnifying-glass, however, reveals the secret at once. The whole of the\r\nsurface is covered with little sharp prickles, curved like hooks, and\r\nturned in all directions, so that, however it may be thrown, some of\r\nthem are sure to catch.\r\n\r\nSo readily do these hooks hold to anything which they touch, that if a\r\nlady only sweeps her dress against a plant of Goose-grass, she is sure\r\nto carry off a considerable number of the seed-vessels, and to waste\r\nmuch time afterwards in picking them off.\r\n\r\nThe seed-vessel of the common Burdock, known popularly by the name of\r\nBur, is armed in a similar manner, but, as it is much larger, it is\r\neasily avoided. Sheep suffer greatly from burs, which twist themselves\r\namong the wool so firmly that it is hardly possible to remove them\r\nwithout cutting away bur and wool together. As to a Skye terrier, when\r\nonce he gets among burs, his life is a misery to him (I was going to\r\nsay, a burden to him, but it would have looked like a pun).\r\n\r\nBelow, and on the left of the Galium-seed, are some spicules of the\r\nHymedesmia, a sponge which is found on the coast of Madeira. The\r\nfollowing account of it occurs in the _Intellectual Observer_, vol. ii.\r\np. 312:--\r\n\r\n     “FISH-HOOK SPICULÆ.--We have received from Mr. Baker, of Holborn, a\r\n     slide containing spicules of the _Hymedesmia Johnsonii_, which are\r\n     stated to be rare objects in this country. They have the form of a\r\n     double fish-hook, and on the inner surface of each hook is an\r\n     extremely sharp knife-edge projection, corresponding with a similar\r\n     and equally sharp projection from the inside of the shank.”\r\n\r\n     “These minute knife-blades are so arranged that in addition to\r\n     their cutting properties, they would act as barbs, obstructing the\r\n     withdrawal of the hook. The two hooks attached to one shank are not\r\n     in the same place, but nearly at right angles with one another, so\r\n     that when one is horizontal the other is vertical, or nearly so. A\r\n     magnification of four or five hundred linear does not in any way\r\n     detract from the sharp appearance of the knife-edges, and they may\r\n     take their place with the anchors of the Synapta as curious\r\n     illustrations of the occurrence in living organisms of forms which\r\n     man was apt to fancy were exclusively the products of his own\r\n     contrivance and skill.\r\n\r\n     “We presume that these hooks of the Hymedesmia answer the usual\r\n     purpose of spiculæ in strengthening the soft tissue, but they must\r\n     likewise render the sponge an awkward article for the Madeira\r\n     sea-slugs to eat.”\r\n\r\nFor an account and figures of the Synapta anchor-spicules see page 39.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to another modification of the hook. I presume that many of\r\nmy readers have heard of the practice called “snatching” fish, though I\r\nhope that they have never been unsportsmanlike enough to follow it.\r\n\r\nThis plan, which is only worthy of poachers, consists in taking several\r\nflights of treble or quadruple hooks, dropping them gently by the side\r\nof the fish, and then, with a sudden jerk, driving them into any part of\r\nits body which they may happen to strike. Most anglers have snatched\r\nfish accidentally, but to do so intentionally is ranked among the worst\r\nof an angler’s crimes, and is equivalent to cheating at cards, or\r\nplaying with false dice.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world, however, there are certain small fish which\r\nare never taken in any other way, and, indeed, are raked out of the\r\nwater just as a gardener rakes dead leaves off the path or beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAGUAR AND CLAW. FISH-RAKE. GAFF.]\r\n\r\nIn British Columbia there are certain lakes tenanted largely with small\r\nfish which form a considerable portion of the natives’ diet. They swim\r\nin vast shoals close to the surface of the water, and are captured by\r\nveritable rakes, one of which is shown in the illustration. The points\r\nof the rake are slightly curved, and very sharp, and so numerous are the\r\nfish that when the native has struck his rake among the shoal, and drawn\r\nit into the boat, he generally finds a fish on every tooth, while it\r\noften happens that two or three are transfixed by the same tooth. A\r\nsharp knock against the side of the boat shakes off the prey, and the\r\nfisherman again strikes his rake into the shoal. By this simple mode of\r\nfishing a couple of men will, in a few hours, load a canoe with small\r\nbut valuable fish.\r\n\r\nBelow the rake is the “Gaff,” an instrument, not to say a weapon, which\r\nis indispensable when salmon or other large fish are to be caught. For\r\nordinary-sized fish a landing-net is sufficient, but no landing-net\r\ncould either receive or retain a salmon of any size.\r\n\r\nRecourse is then had to the Gaff, which is simply a huge hook at the end\r\nof a handle. The fish being “played” until it can be drawn within reach,\r\nthe gaff is slipped under it, struck into the side of the salmon, and by\r\nits aid the fish is easily lifted out of the water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration are two figures showing how the\r\nprinciple of the fish-rake and gaff has been anticipated in Nature.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the Jaguar feeds largely on fish, which it\r\ncatches for itself. It goes down to the river-side as close to the water\r\nas possible, and waits patiently for its prey. As soon as a fish comes\r\nwithin reach, the Jaguar stretches out its paw to the fullest extent,\r\nand, with a stroke of the curved claws, hooks the fish on shore, just as\r\nthe Vancouver Islander does with his fish-rake, or the English angler\r\nwith his gaff.\r\n\r\nMany persons have practically experienced the gaff-like powers of the\r\nfeline claw by the loss of their gold-fish. It is seldom safe to leave a\r\nglobe of gold-fish within reach of a cat. Nearly all cats are madly fond\r\nof fish, and, in spite of their instinctive hatred of water, will hook\r\nout the fish with their claws, and eat them. Indeed, there are several\r\ninstances on record where a cat has regularly caught fish, and brought\r\nthem home to its owner. Mr. F. Buckland gives an account of a\r\nfisherman’s cat, which used to go out with her master, jump into the\r\nsea, secure a fish, and then be lifted on board with her prey.\r\n\r\nAbove the Jaguar is drawn a single claw, so as to show the form of the\r\ninstrument by which the fish is captured.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMOUR.\r\n\r\nWe will now take the subject of Defensive Armour, by which warriors are\r\nenabled to protect themselves against the offensive weapons of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nAs many readers will probably know, armour reached its greatest\r\ndevelopment in the Middle Ages, when the knight was so completely cased\r\nin steel that no weapon then in use could penetrate his panoply.\r\n\r\nThe head, body, and limbs were covered with steel plates curiously\r\narticulated at the joints, so as to give freedom of motion, while\r\nguarding the wearer from any ordinary weapon. A warrior might be beaten\r\nfrom his horse by a mace, or struck down by a lance, or the horse itself\r\nmight be killed under him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n         LOBSTER.\r\n        ARMADILLO.\r\nPICHICIAGO.      CHITON.\r\n\r\nPLATE AND SCALE ARMOUR\r\nOF MIDDLE AGES.]\r\n\r\nIn either of these cases the fallen knight was not much the worse, until\r\na weapon called the “Misericorde,” or dagger of mercy, was invented.\r\nThis was a poniard with a very slender and very sharp blade, so\r\nconstructed that it could be driven between the joints of the armour,\r\nand thus inflict a mortal wound. The Misericorde, however, was baffled\r\nby the use of chain or scale armour under the plate-mail, and then the\r\nonly way of getting at the fallen knight was by breaking up the armour\r\nwith hammers which were made for this express purpose.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may wonder that any one should lie quietly and allow\r\nhimself to be so badly treated. The very strength of the armour,\r\nhowever, which rendered its wearer unassailable by ordinary weapons,\r\ninvolved so much weight, that when a knight had fallen, it was\r\nimpossible for him to rise, much less to mount a horse, without help.\r\nMoreover, the first blow of a weighty hammer on the helmet would,\r\nalthough it could not kill the wearer, cause such a jar to his brain as\r\npartially, if not wholly, to stun him.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly increasing power of firearms soon caused armour to be laid\r\naside, and now the only remains of it are to be found in the helmets and\r\ncuirasses worn by our dragoons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE are few parts of the world where armour of some sort is not used.\r\nPutting aside civilised or semi-civilised nations, we find that in most\r\ncases, wherever there is war, there is armour of some kind. Sometimes it\r\nis movable, and in that case is called a shield.\r\n\r\nThe most singular shields that I know are those made by the Australians,\r\nwhich are so shaped that no one who did not know their use would take\r\nthem for shields. They are about three feet long, four inches wide at\r\nthe back, six inches or so thick in the middle, tapering towards the\r\nends, and coming to an edge in front. They are held by the centre with\r\none hand, so that they can be rapidly twisted from side to side, and so\r\nserve to parry the spear or stop the boomerang. The weight of the shield\r\nenables it to withstand the shock of the boomerang, which whirls through\r\nthe air with terrific force.\r\n\r\nSeveral warlike savage tribes have, however, no armour of any kind, such\r\nas the New Zealanders, the Samoans, and the Fijians.\r\n\r\nSometimes the armour is affixed to the body, and of such protection many\r\nexamples are to be found in various museums, among which the Christy\r\ncollection is pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nAmong the Polynesians cocoa-nut fibre was at one time employed as the\r\nmaterial for armour. It was twisted into small cords, and with these a\r\nsort of armour was constructed, quite strong enough to resist any weapon\r\nthat an enemy of their own kind could bring against them. Sometimes this\r\narmour was merely a belt wide enough to protect the abdomen, but\r\nsometimes the whole body was defended, from the neck to the hips.\r\n\r\nIn the United Service Museum there is a very remarkable cuirass, which\r\nis made of successive rows of seals’ teeth, each row overlapping the\r\nother like the tiles of a house. It is very heavy, weighing quite as\r\nmuch as a steel cuirass, and was probably quite as effective against the\r\nprimitive weapons which could be brought to bear upon it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW for Natural Armour.\r\n\r\nThere are so many examples of armour, as furnished by Nature, that I can\r\nonly mention a few.\r\n\r\nAny one who looks at a lobster, crayfish, prawn, or shrimp, must at once\r\nsee that in it lies the prototype of plate armour. That portion of the\r\nlobster which is popularly called the head, and is scientifically known\r\nas the “carapace,” is not jointed, and corresponds with the cuirass of\r\nancient or modern armour. Then comes the part called the “tail,” the\r\njoints of which are exactly like those employed in the shoulders,\r\nelbows, knees, and ankles of ancient armour. The lobster tail will again\r\nbe mentioned in connection with another branch of human art.\r\n\r\nAs for the heavy, ungraceful armour which was used in tilting, we have\r\nan admirable example in the Trunk-fish of the tropical seas\r\n(_Ostracion_), the whole of which is enclosed in a bony case, the fins\r\nand tail protruding through openings in it. In fact, the scales, instead\r\nof being separate, are fused together so as to form a continuous\r\ncovering. The Box-tortoise of South America is another good example, the\r\ncreature being furnished with bony flaps with which it covers the\r\napertures through which the head, legs, and tail are protruded, and so\r\nis as impervious as the knight of old.\r\n\r\nIn the later ages of armour, the thighs, instead of being enclosed in\r\nsteel coverings with cuisses, were defended by a number of steel plates\r\ncalled “tassets.” Now these tassets are exactly like the defensive\r\narmour of the Armadillo’s back, and, though it is not likely that the\r\ninventor of tassets should have seen an Armadillo, the fact still\r\nremains, that Art has been anticipated by Nature.\r\n\r\nExactly the same principle is seen in that wonderful little animal, the\r\nPichiciago of South America, which is shown in the lower left-hand\r\nfigure of the illustration. This creature is not only furnished with\r\nbony rings on the body like those of the Armadillo, but has likewise a\r\nflap which comes over the hindquarters, and effectually defends it\r\nagainst the attacks of any foe that might pursue it into its burrow.\r\n\r\nIn the lower right-hand corner of the illustration is seen a figure of a\r\nChiton, several species of which are common on most of our coasts. This\r\nis one of the molluscs, which adheres to the rock just as limpets do.\r\nBut, whereas the shell of the limpet is all in one piece and inflexible,\r\nthat of the Chiton is composed of several pieces, which are arranged\r\nexactly like the tassets of armour, and enable the Chiton to accommodate\r\nitself to the inequalities of the rocks to which it is adhering.\r\n\r\nThe common Pill Millipede, which rolls itself up in a ball when alarmed,\r\nis a familiar instance of similar defensive armour, and much the same\r\nmay be said of the Julus Millipede.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCALES OF MANIS. SCALE-MAIL.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to Scale Armour, which is one of the earliest modes of\r\nprotecting the body, and the idea of which was clearly taken from animal\r\nlife. In Scale Armour, flat plates of metal, horn, or bone are sewn to a\r\nlinen or leathern vest in such a way that the scales overlap each other,\r\nand so tend to throw off the blow of a weapon. One great advantage of\r\nthis armour is its lightness and flexibility, the former quality\r\nallowing of more prolonged exertion than could be possible with the\r\nheavy plate armour, and the latter rendering that exertion less\r\nfatiguing to the limbs.\r\n\r\nA glance at the preceding illustration will show how the scale armour of\r\nthe human warrior has been anticipated by Nature.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand is an example of ordinary scale armour, while on the\r\nopposite side is a portion of a scaly surface. This figure represents\r\nsome of the scales of a Manis. These scales are wonderfully hard, and\r\nscarcely to be penetrated. I have in my collection the skin of a\r\nShort-tailed Manis, which had been kept for some time in an Indian\r\ncompound, but which made itself such a nuisance by its perpetual\r\nburrowing, that its owner was forced to condemn it to death.\r\n\r\nSo he took a Colt’s revolver, and fired at it from a distance of a yard\r\nor two. The only result was to knock over the Manis, which rolled itself\r\nup, and appeared to be none the worse. A second and a third shot were\r\nfired with similar results, and the last bullet recoiled upon the firer.\r\nAt last, the animal was killed by introducing the point of a dagger\r\nunder the scales, and driving it in with a mallet. The Manis itself is\r\ngiven in the illustration on page 189.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKIN OF SINGLETHORN. SCALE-MAIL.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the scales of most fishes afford excellent examples of scale\r\narmour. I have selected one, the Japanese Singlethorn, on account of the\r\nstrength of the scales, each of which is deeply ridged and furrowed. The\r\nreader will probably have noticed that the skin of the animal, into\r\nwhich are inserted the bases of the scales, is analogous to the linen or\r\nleathern foundation upon which the artificial scales are sewn.\r\n\r\nEven feathers give a better protection than might be imagined from their\r\nindividually fragile structure. This is well shown in the case of\r\naquatic birds, whose feathers are very closely pressed together, each\r\noverlapping the next, and set in regular order. Not only is the plumage\r\nrendered water-tight, but it is able to resist a severe blow. This is\r\nwell known by sportsmen, who do not fire at ducks or geese while they\r\nare approaching, knowing that their shot would only glide harmlessly\r\nfrom the feather-mail of the bird.\r\n\r\nThey wait until the birds have passed, and then find no difficulty in\r\nkilling them, the shot penetrating under the feathers just as did the\r\ndagger under the scales of the manis. Even the diminutive puffin, or\r\nsea-parrot, as it is sometimes called, cares little for shot while it is\r\nsitting on the rocks with closed wings and feathers pressed together.\r\nWhen, however, it takes to flight, it can be killed without difficulty.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may be aware that the ancient Mexican\r\nwarriors wore armour made of feathers, which I presume must have been\r\narranged much after the fashion of those of a duck’s breast.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable Feather-mail is mentioned by Southey in his poem, “Madoc\r\nin Aztlan.” In canto xviii, is recounted the single combat between Madoc\r\nand Coanocotsin, the King of Aztlan. The contrasting armour and weapons\r\nof each are graphically described, and especial mention is made of the\r\ncuirass:--\r\n\r\n                          “Over the breast,\r\n    And o’er the golden breastplate of the King,\r\n    A feathery cuirass, beautiful to eye,\r\n    Light as the robe of peace, yet strong to save;\r\n    For the sharp faulchion’s baffled edge would glide\r\n    From its smooth softness.”\r\n\r\nThen, in the course of the combat, when the King has been grappled in\r\nMadoc’s arms and forced to drop his buckler and club, the narrative\r\nproceeds:--\r\n\r\n                  “Which when the Prince beheld,\r\n    He thrust him off, and drawing back, resumed\r\n    The sword that from his wrist suspended hung,\r\n    And twice he smote the King. Twice from the quilt\r\n    Of plumes the iron glides.”\r\n\r\nIf such armour could in truth resist the weapons which have been\r\ndiscovered, it must have been a wonderfully strong garment, for the\r\nMexican swords, though made of wood, are edged with flakes of obsidian,\r\nwhich cuts like a razor. I have a number of these flakes, which have\r\nevidently been intended for the edges of a sword, but have not been\r\nused.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is another kind of armour which is still used in some parts of the\r\nworld, and at one time was employed in this country. This is the Quilt\r\nArmour, which is made by enclosing a thick layer of some fibre, such as\r\nsilk or cotton, between two pieces of fabric, and then sewing them\r\nacross and across, so as to keep the lining or stuffing in its place.\r\n\r\nThe eider-down quilts are familiar examples of such fabrics, and so are\r\nthe quilted petticoats, which are so comfortable in winter. Horsehair\r\nand flock mattresses are made in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nInsufficient as it may appear to be, the quilt armour, when well made,\r\nis really proof against most weapons, even against firearms, as we shall\r\npresently see. Being very much lighter than steel, it was easier for the\r\nwearer, its chief drawback being that its extreme thickness gave it a\r\nvery clumsy and awkward look. Those who wore it, however, cared more for\r\ntheir safety than their appearance, as was exemplified by James I., who\r\nlived in perpetual fear of assassination, but who had a nervous dislike\r\nto arms, whether offensive or defensive. He therefore wore a cuirass\r\nquilted with silk, which answered every purpose of defence, while it did\r\nnot offend his nerves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may remember that in “Peveril of the Peak” Sir Walter\r\nScott gives a ludicrous picture of the timid justice, his fears of the\r\nPopish plot, his suit of quilted armour, and his “Protestant Flail” with\r\nwhich he hits himself on the head instead of striking his supposed\r\nenemy:--\r\n\r\n“Some ingenious artist, belonging, we may presume, to the worshipful\r\nMercers’ Company, had contrived a species of armour of which neither the\r\nhorse armoury in the Tower, nor Gwynnap’s Gothic Hall, no, nor Dr.\r\nMeyrick’s invaluable collection of ancient arms, has preserved any\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\n“It was called Silk-armour, being composed of a doublet and breeches of\r\nquilted silk, so closely stitched, and of such thickness, as to be proof\r\nagainst either bullet or steel, while a thick bonnet of the same\r\nmaterials, with ear-flaps attached to it, and on the whole much\r\nresembling a nightcap, completed the equipment, and ascertained the\r\nsecurity of the wearer from the head to the knee. Master Maulstatute,\r\namong other worthy citizens, had adopted this singular panoply, which\r\nhad the advantage of being soft, and warm and flexible, as well as\r\nsafe. And he was sat in his judicial elbow-chair--a short, rotund\r\nfigure, hung round, as it were, with cushions, for such was the\r\nappearance of the quilted garments--and with a nose protruded from under\r\nthe silken casque, the size of which, together with the unwieldiness of\r\nthe whole figure, gave his worship no indifferent resemblance to the\r\nsign of the Hog in Armour, which was considerably improved by the\r\ndefensive garment being of a dusky orange colour, not altogether unlike\r\nthe hue of those half-wild swine which are to be found in the forests of\r\nHampshire.”\r\n\r\nRoger Nutt gives as a reason for the security of quilted armour, that it\r\nmade the wearer look so ridiculous that no one could hit him for\r\nlaughing. The reader will probably remember that the sign of the Hog in\r\nArmour was really a representation of the rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThat such a cuirass is really impervious to ordinary weapons is shown by\r\nthe following anecdote:--During one of the late Indian wars a trooper\r\ndischarged his pistol close to the back of a fleeing horseman. The shot\r\nproduced no apparent effect, and the man rode off. Presently, however, a\r\nthin cloud of smoke was seen to rise from his shoulders. The smoke\r\nthickened, then burst into flame, and after riding at desperate speed in\r\nhopes of overtaking his comrades, the unfortunate man fell from his\r\nhorse, and was miserably burned to death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN RHINOCEROS. QUILTED ARMOUR.]\r\n\r\nThe fact was that cotton being cheaper than silk, he had wadded his\r\ncuirass with cotton fibre. Had he chosen silk, he would have got off in\r\nsafety. Among the Chinese this cotton mail is largely used. In\r\nconsequence, many Chinese soldiers were found who had been burned to\r\ndeath in exactly the same way as the Indian warrior.\r\n\r\nTowards the south-western parts of Africa there is a nation called the\r\nBegharmis. Their soldiers are mounted, and are all furnished with suits\r\nof quilted mail, which fall below the knee as the rider is seated on his\r\nhorse. Not only is the rider thus defended, but the horse also, which is\r\ncovered with quilted armour like that of its rider, the appearance of\r\nboth being exceedingly grotesque.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE are several examples of such armour in the animal world, the\r\nprincipal of which is the Indian Rhinoceros. Any one who has seen this\r\nanimal, or even a good portrait of it, will at once recognise the\r\nparallel between the heavy folds of its thick skin and the padded flaps\r\nof the quilted mail. The blubber with which the whale is so thickly\r\ncoated affords another example of the parallel between Nature and Art.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the days of ancient Rome there was a curious military manœuvre, by\r\nwhich the defensive armour of individual soldiers might be made\r\ncollectively useful. This manœuvre was called Forming a Tortoise\r\n(_testudinem facere_), and is thus described in Smith’s “Dictionary of\r\nGreek and Roman Antiquities:”--\r\n\r\n“The name of Testudo was also applied to the covering made by a close\r\nbody of soldiers, who placed their shields over their heads to screen\r\nthemselves against the darts of the enemy. The shields fitted so closely\r\ntogether as to present one unbroken surface without any interstices\r\nbetween them, and were so firm that men could walk upon them, and even\r\nhorses and chariots be driven over them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TORTOISE. ROMAN TESTUDO.]\r\n\r\n“A Testudo was formed either in battle, to ward off the arrows and other\r\nmissiles of the enemy, or, which was more frequently the case, to form a\r\nprotection to the soldiers when they advanced to the walls or gates of a\r\ntown for the purpose of attacking them.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes the shields were disposed in such a way as to make the\r\nTestudo slope. The soldiers in the first line stood upright, those in\r\nthe centre stooped a little, and each line successively was a little\r\nlower than the preceding, down to the last, where the soldiers rested on\r\none knee. Such a disposition of the shields was called _Fastigata\r\nTestudo_, on account of their sloping like the roof of a building.\r\n\r\n“The advantages of this plan were obvious. The stones and missiles\r\nthrown upon the shields rolled off them like water from a roof; besides\r\nwhich, other soldiers frequently advanced upon them to attack the enemy\r\nupon the walls. The Romans were accustomed to form this kind of Testudo\r\nas an exercise in the games of the Circus.”\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration is shown a portion of a Testudo of\r\nthree ranks, taken from the Antonine column. On the left is an ordinary\r\nTortoise. Sometimes the Testudo was a covered machine on wheels, and\r\nguarded above with a supplementary roof of wet hides arranged in scale\r\nfashion, so as to prevent it from being set on fire by the besieged, and\r\nto throw off the heavy missiles which were dropped upon it. Under cover\r\nof this Testudo, the soldiers could either undermine the walls, or bring\r\na battering-ram to bear upon them, while the men who worked it were\r\nsafely under cover. As to the battering-ram itself, we shall presently\r\ntreat of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORT.\r\n\r\nAs we have treated of one of the modes by which Forts were assaulted, we\r\nwill now come to the Fort itself.\r\n\r\nThe transitions in Fort-making are too curious to be omitted from the\r\npresent book. As soon as war became organized, a Fort of some kind was\r\nnecessary. The simplest mode of making a Fort was evidently to dig a\r\ndeep trench, and throw up the earth on the inside, so as to form a wall.\r\nLet such a trench be square or circular, and there is a simple but\r\npowerful Fort, by means of which a comparatively small garrison could\r\ndefend themselves against a superior force.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were great masters of this art, fighting as much with the\r\nspade as the sword. So strong and thorough was the old Roman work that\r\nmany of their camps still remain, and will remain for centuries if man\r\ndoes not deface them. Such, for example, are Cæsar’s camp, near\r\nAldershot, and the fine camp at Lyddington, in Wiltshire, almost every\r\ndetail of which is preserved. Roman camps are all constructed on the\r\nsame model, the general’s place, or Prætorium, being in the centre,\r\nwhence he issued his orders, and the commanders under him occupying the\r\ncorners. Thus, no matter how he might be shifted from one corps to\r\nanother, every Roman soldier knew his way about the camp without needing\r\nto see it, and could tell at any moment where to find any officer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELK FORT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUND FORT.]\r\n\r\nOther nations made their Forts circular, an example of which I lately\r\nsaw a few miles from Bideford, while others consisted of nearly parallel\r\nlines, enclosures, and demi-lunes, like those wonderful dykes near\r\nClovelly, which occupy more than thirty acres of land. One of the\r\ncircular Forts is shown on the right hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, stone took the place of earth, and the principal object\r\nof the builder was to give considerable thickness below, so as to resist\r\nthe battering-ram, and great height both to walls and towers, so as to\r\nbe comparatively out of the reach of the arrows and other missiles of\r\nthe besiegers.\r\n\r\nFor awhile, such castles were impregnable, and the owners thereof were\r\nthe irresponsible despots of the neighbourhood, recognising no law but\r\ntheir own will, robbing, torturing, and murdering at pleasure, and\r\nsetting the king at open defiance. When, however, the tremendous powers\r\nof artillery became developed, the age of stone castles passed away.\r\nHeight was found to be equivalent to weakness, as the strongest tower in\r\nexistence could be knocked to pieces in an hour or two, and do infinite\r\nharm within the fortress by its falling fragments.\r\n\r\nFortification then returned to its original principles. Earth took the\r\nplace of stone or brick; and at the present day, instead of erecting\r\nlofty walls and stately towers, the military engineer sinks his\r\nbuildings as far as he can into the ground, and protects them with banks\r\nof simple earth, which is found to be the best defence against heavy\r\nshot. There is no masonry in existence that will endure the artillery\r\nfire of the present day, and even the solid rock can be knocked to\r\npieces by it. But an earth-mound is a different business, and will\r\nabsorb as many shot and shell as can be poured into it, without being\r\nmuch the worse for it. See, for example, the Proof-mound at Woolwich,\r\nwhich receives the shot of guns as they are being proved. Now, this\r\nmound has undergone perpetual battering for many years, and is as strong\r\nas ever. The same thing may be said of the celebrated Mamelon before\r\nSebastopol.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSO much for the Fort made by the hand of man. We now come to that which\r\nis formed by the feet of animals.\r\n\r\nThe Elk, or Moose, an inhabitant of Northern Europe, finds itself in\r\ngreat danger during the winter, the wolves being its chief enemies. At\r\ncertain times of the year there comes a partial thaw during the day,\r\nfollowed by a frost at night. The result is, that a slight cake of ice\r\nforms on the surface of the snow, too slight to bear the weight of so\r\nheavy an animal, and strong enough to cut the legs of the elk as it\r\nploughs its way along. Now, the wolves are sufficiently light to pass\r\nover the frozen surface without breaking it, and accordingly, they can\r\neasily run down and secure the elk.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to counteract the wolves, a number of elks select a\r\nconvenient spot where they can find food, and unite in trampling the\r\nsnow down so as to sink themselves nearly to their own height below its\r\nsurface. The wolves never dare attack an Elk-yard, as this enclosure is\r\ntermed. In the first place, they are always haunted with suspicions of\r\ntraps, and do not like the look of the yard; and in the next place, if\r\nsome of the wolves did venture within the fort, the elks would soon\r\ndemolish them with hoofs and horns. One of these Elk-yards is seen on\r\nthe left hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AND HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSCALING INSTRUMENTS.--DEFENCE OF FORT.--IMITATION.--THE FALL-TRAP.\r\n\r\n     Scaling-forks.--The Climbing-spur and its Use.--Larva of the\r\n     Tiger-beetle.--Hooks of Serpula.--Mr. Gosse’s Description.--Falling\r\n     Stones.--A Stone rolling down a Precipice.--The Polar Bear and the\r\n     Walrus.--Imitation.--The Polar Bear and the Seal.--The Esquimaux\r\n     Hunter “Seal-talking.”--Enticing Mother by means of Young.--The\r\n     Fall-trap and its Variations.--The Schoolboy’s\r\n     “Booby-trap.”--Curious Mode of killing Elephants.--The\r\n     Elephant-spear.--The Hippopotamus-trap of Southern Africa.--The\r\n     Mangrove and its Seeds.--The Spring-gun and Spring-bow.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing the subject of the Fortress, we will glance at the\r\nAttack and Defence, as seen in Nature and Art.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALING INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the Battering-ram could be worked against the\r\nwalls of a fort, or how the assailants could scale them by means of the\r\nTestudo. There must, however, be occasions when it would be impossible\r\nto bring together a sufficiently large body of men to form the Testudo,\r\nor even to place ladders, and in such instances it would be necessary\r\nthat each soldier should be furnished with an instrument by which he\r\ncould haul himself up the wall.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples still extant of such weapons, which were called\r\n“Scaling-forks,” and their general appearance may be known by the two\r\nright-hand figures of the cut. The handles of these weapons were very\r\nlong, and by them the soldier hauled himself to the top of the wall. In\r\nsome of these instruments the shafts were armed with projecting pegs,\r\nset at regular intervals, so that they acted as the steps of a ladder,\r\nand rendered the ascent comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nMany of the long-handled partisans, such as the well-known Jedwood axe,\r\nwere furnished with a hook upon the back of the blade, so that the\r\nweapon served the purpose of a scaling-fork as well as a battle-axe.\r\n\r\nThe Scaling-fork (German _Sturmgabel_), which is shown on the right hand\r\nof the illustration, was in use somewhere about A.D. 1500. That which is\r\nshown next to it is about a hundred years later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nWALRUS TUSKS. LARVA OF TIGER-BEETLE. CLIMBING-SPUR. SCALING-FORKS.\r\nHOOKS OF SERPULA.]\r\n\r\nDemmin, from whose work these figures are taken, mentions that at the\r\nsiege of Mons, in 1691, the grenadiers of the elder Dauphin’s regiment\r\nstormed the walls under the command of Vauban, and, by means of the\r\nScaling-fork, carried the breastwork, which they assaulted. As a mark of\r\nhonour to these gallant men, Louis XIV. ordered that the sergeants of\r\nthe regiment should carry scaling-forks instead of halberds, which had\r\nbeen the peculiar weapon of the sergeant until comparatively late days,\r\njust as the spontoon, or half-pike, was the weapon of the infantry\r\nofficer from A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1800, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe English student will remember that in the writings of Sterne,\r\nFielding, and Smollett the half-pike is frequently mentioned as the\r\nweapon of a subaltern officer. Demmin states that the last spontoons\r\nused in France were carried by the French Guards in 1789.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPERHAPS the Climbing-spur may be familiar to some of my readers, and\r\nbring back a reminiscence of boyhood. There is nothing more tantalising\r\nto a boy than to see a hawk, or magpie nest at the top of a tree which\r\nis too large to be climbed in the ordinary way, and which has no\r\nbranches within many feet of the ground. However, boyish ingenuity has\r\nbrought almost any tree within the power of a bird’s-nester by the\r\ninvention of the Climbing-irons.\r\n\r\nThese are made so as to pass under the foot like a stirrup, and can be\r\nsecured to the leg by leathern straps, the hooks being, of course, on\r\nthe inside of the leg. The cut represents the Climbing-iron of the right\r\nleg. By means of these instruments, a very large tree can be mounted,\r\nthe irons being struck firmly into the bark, and the legs moved\r\nalternately, and not in the usual manner of climbing. Sometimes the hook\r\nof the Climbing-iron is terminated by a single instead of a double\r\npoint, but the principle is the same in all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now look for similar examples in Nature.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the left-hand group is shown the larva or grub of the\r\ncommon Tiger-beetle, which is itself a curious creature.\r\n\r\nIt lives in perpendicular burrows, feeding upon those insects which come\r\nwithin its reach. Its usual position is at the upper part of the burrow,\r\nwith its jaws widely extended, so as to snap up any insect that may\r\nventure too near.\r\n\r\nWhen it has secured its prey, it seeks the bottom of its burrow, makes\r\nits meal in quiet, and reascends. How it does so we shall soon see.\r\nTowards the end of the body, one of the segments is much enlarged, and\r\nhas a bold prominence upon the back. On the summit of this prominence\r\nthere are two horn-like hooks, shaped as seen in the illustration. These\r\nhooks are used exactly like the boy’s climbing-spurs, the alternate\r\nelongation and contraction of the body answering the same purpose as the\r\nmovements of the boy’s legs. When the larva has seized its prey and\r\nwishes to retreat, all that it has to do is to withdraw the hooks,\r\nstraighten the body, and down it falls by its own weight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the nautical branch of this subject I have already treated of the\r\ncurious pushing-poles by means of which the Serpula protrudes itself\r\nfrom its tube. As all must have noticed who have seen these creatures\r\nalive, the Serpula protrudes itself very slowly, but flies back into its\r\ntube with such velocity that the eye can scarcely follow its movements.\r\nIts difference of motion shows that there must be a difference in the\r\nmeans by which these movements are produced.\r\n\r\nReferring to the illustration on page 45, the reader will see that the\r\ninstruments with which the Serpula propels itself are used just after\r\nthe fashion of punt-poles, and cannot act with any great swiftness.\r\nWhen, however, the creature wishes to withdraw itself, it employs a\r\ncurious apparatus, consisting of many rows of little hooks. The points\r\nof these hooks readily catch against the lining of the tube, and by\r\ntheir aid the worm jerks itself back with wonderful celerity.\r\n\r\nThree rows of these hooks are shown next to the Tiger-beetle larva.\r\n\r\nThe structure of these remarkable organs is elaborately described by Mr.\r\nGosse in his “Evenings with the Microscope:”--\r\n\r\n“If you look again at this Serpula recently extracted, you will find\r\nwith a lens a pale yellow line running along the upper surface of each\r\nfoot, transversely to the length of the body. This is the border of an\r\nexceedingly delicate membrane, and, on placing it under a high power\r\n(say six hundred diameters), you will be astonished at the elaborate\r\nprovision here made for prehension.”\r\n\r\n“This yellow line, which cannot be appreciated by the unassisted eye, is\r\na muscular ribbon, over which stand edgewise a multitude of what I will\r\ncall combs, or rather subtriangular plates. These have a wide base, and\r\nthe apex of the triangle is curved over into an abrupt hook, and then\r\nthis cut into a number (from four to six) of sharp and long teeth.”\r\n\r\n“The plates stand side by side, parallel to each other, along the whole\r\nlength of the ribbon, and there are muscular fibres seen affixed to the\r\nbasal side of each plate, which doubtless give it independent motion.\r\n\r\n“I have counted one hundred and thirty-six plates on one ribbon. There\r\nare two ribbons on each thoracic segment, and there are seven such\r\nsegments. Hence, we may compute the total number of prehensile comb-like\r\nplates on this portion of the body to be about one thousand nine\r\nhundred, each of which is wielded by muscles at the will of the animal;\r\nwhile, as each plate carries on an average five teeth, there are nearly\r\n_ten thousand teeth_ hooked into the lining membrane of the cell, when\r\nthe animal chooses to descend.”\r\n\r\n“Even this, however, is far short of the total number, because long\r\nribbons of hooks of a similar structure, but of smaller dimensions, run\r\nacross the abdominal segments, which are more numerous than the\r\nthoracic. No wonder, with so many muscles wielding so many\r\ngrappling-hooks, that the descent is so rapidly effected.”\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to the Walrus, whose strangely elongated upper canine\r\nteeth can be used for just the same purposes as the scaling-fork or\r\nclimbing-spur. As, however, reference has already been made to these\r\ntusks, in connection with another department of this work, there is no\r\nnecessity for occupying space with a second description.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENCE OF FORT.\r\n\r\nSo much for attack; now for defence.\r\n\r\nThe simplest mode of defending a fort, or even a mountain pass, is by\r\nthrowing or rolling rocks and heavy stones against the enemy.\r\n\r\nSimple as it may appear, it is a very effective one, as can be well\r\nunderstood by those who have rolled a huge stone down a long and steep\r\nslope. The stone goes gently enough at first, but rapidly gains speed,\r\nuntil at last it makes great bounds from the earth, tearing and crashing\r\nthrough everything as if it had been shot from a cannon.\r\n\r\nI have seen a stone which was too heavy to be lifted, and had to be\r\nprised over the edge with levers, spring completely through the topmost\r\nbranches of a high tree, scattering the boughs in all directions, and\r\nthen, alighting on another stone, split into many fragments, just like\r\nthe pieces of a burst shell. That one stone would have swept off a whole\r\nparty of soldiers had they encountered it while trying to ascend the\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nThis invention has also been anticipated in Nature.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the obvious reflection that the most primitive warriors\r\nmust have noticed the effects of stones falling over a precipice, we\r\nhave, in Captain Hall’s “Life with the Esquimaux,” a curious account of\r\nthe Polar Bear and its mode of killing the Walrus. Gigantic as is this\r\nanimal, and terrible as are its tusks, the Polar Bear will sometimes\r\nattack it in a very singular manner. The Bear springs on a sleeping\r\nWalrus, and clings to its shoulders with one paw, and with repeated\r\nblows from the other, fractures its skull.\r\n\r\nStill, the combat is sure to be a severe one, and so the Polar Bear\r\nwill, if he can, secure his prey by some other method.\r\n\r\n“The natives tell many most interesting anecdotes of the Bear, showing\r\nthat they are accustomed to watch his movements closely. He has a very\r\ningenious method of killing the Walrus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAR KILLING WALRUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARRIORS DEPENDING A PASS.]\r\n\r\n“In August, every fine day, the Walrus makes its way to the shore, draws\r\nits huge body upon the rocks, and basks in the sun. If this happen near\r\nthe base of a cliff, the ever-watchful Bear takes advantage of the\r\ncircumstance to attack his formidable game in this way. The Bear mounts\r\nthe cliff, and throws down upon the animal’s head a large rock,\r\ncalculating the distance and the curve with astonishing accuracy, and\r\nthus crushing the thick, bullet-proof skull.\r\n\r\n“If the Walrus is not instantly killed, or simply stunned, the Bear\r\nrushes down to it, seizes the rock, and hammers away at the head until\r\nthe skull is broken. A fat feast follows. Unless the Bear is very\r\nhungry, it eats only the blubber of the walrus, seal, and whale.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIMITATION.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with the Norwegians, the Esquimaux have the greatest\r\nrespect for the intellectual as well as the bodily powers of the Bear,\r\nand avowedly imitate it in its modes of hunting. One of these methods\r\nwill now be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt must first be premised that the Seal is a most wary animal, and when\r\nit lies down on the shore to sleep, it takes its repose by snatches,\r\nlifting up its head at very short intervals, looking all round in search\r\nof foes, and then composing itself to rest again. To approach so\r\ncautious an animal is evidently a difficult task, but the Bear is equal\r\nto it. The following is Captain Hall’s account:--\r\n\r\n“From the Polar Bear the Innuits (_i.e._ Esquimaux) learn much.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLAR BEAR HUNTING SEAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESQUIMAUX HUNTING SEAL.]\r\n\r\n“The manner of approaching the Seal, which is on the ice by its hole,\r\nbasking in the sunshine, is from him. The Bear lies down and crawls by\r\nhitches towards the Seal, ‘talking’ to it, as the Innuits say, until he\r\nis within striking distance, when he pounces upon it with a single jump.\r\nThe natives say that if they could ‘talk’ as well as the Bear, they\r\ncould catch many more Seals.\r\n\r\n“The procedure of the Bear is as follows.\r\n\r\n“He proceeds very cautiously towards the black speck, far off on the\r\nice, which he knows to be a Seal. When still a long way from it, he\r\nthrows himself down and hitches himself along towards his game. The\r\nSeal, meanwhile, is taking its naps of about ten seconds each,\r\ninvariably raising its head and surveying the entire horizon before\r\ncomposing itself again to brief slumber.\r\n\r\n“As soon as it raises its head, the Bear ‘talks,’ keeping perfectly\r\nstill. The Seal, if it sees anything, sees but the head, which it takes\r\nfor that of another Seal. It sleeps again. Again the Bear hitches\r\nhimself along, and once more the Seal looks around, only to be ‘talked’\r\nto and again deceived. Thus the pursuit goes on until the Seal is\r\ncaught, or till it makes its escape, which it seldom does.”\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that while this “talk” is going on, the Seal appears to\r\nbe charmed, raises and shakes its flippers about, rolls over on its side\r\nand back, as if delighted, and then lies down to sleep.\r\n\r\nNow, the Esquimaux hunters imitate, as nearly as they can, the\r\nproceedings of the Bear, but are not so successful. Captain Hall\r\nmentions several instances where the native hunter failed even to come\r\nwithin gunshot without alarming the Seal, which instantly plunged into\r\nits hole and was lost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE same author mentions another instance where the Esquimaux hunter has\r\ncopied the Bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLAR BEAR CATCHING SEAL, ETC.]\r\n\r\nWhen an Esquimaux hunter catches a young Seal, he takes care not to kill\r\nit at once, as he wishes to use it as a decoy. He ties a long line round\r\none of the hind flippers, and then drops the little Seal into the hole\r\nthrough the ice by which it enters and leaves the water. The struggles\r\nof the young are nearly sure to attract the mother, and when she has\r\ndiscovered its condition the young Seal is cautiously drawn up on the\r\nice. The mother follows, too intent on rescuing her young to think about\r\nherself, and, as soon as she is within reach, she is struck with the\r\nharpoon.\r\n\r\nThe Polar Bear, however, preceded the Esquimaux in this mode of hunting.\r\nThe young Seal lives in a hemispherical dwelling scooped out of the\r\nsnow, and communicating with the water by means of a hole through the\r\nice. This dwelling will be described and figured when we come to the\r\nsubject of Architecture.\r\n\r\nFinding out, by scent or some other means, the habitation of the young\r\nSeal, the Polar Bear leaps upon the snow, bringing his feet together,\r\nand with his enormous weight breaking through the roof of the dwelling.\r\nHe instantly captures the young Seal before it can make its escape.\r\nThen, driving the talons of one paw into its hind flipper, he lets it\r\ninto the hole, and allows it to flounder about in the water. When the\r\nmother is attracted to her young, he draws his prey slowly up on the\r\nice. The anxious mother follows, and is at once secured by the talons of\r\nthe other foot, as is represented in the illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL-TRAP.\r\n\r\nThis is a stratagem which is often employed in War and Hunting, though\r\nits use is mostly confined to the latter. Schoolboys often avail\r\nthemselves of this principle when they wish to play a practical joke,\r\nand to amuse themselves by setting a “Booby-trap.” This trap is easily\r\nmanufactured, and consists of a partially opened door, with a basin or\r\njug of water balanced upon it. The natural result is, that any one who\r\nopens the door without proper precautions receives the jug and its\r\ncontents upon his head, and is thoroughly drenched.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration is seen a curious spear, the butt\r\nof which, instead of being lighter than the head, is very much heavier.\r\nThe weight, however, is exactly where it is wanted, and indeed, in\r\nactual use, is trebled by a mass of tenacious clay, kneaded upon it.\r\nThis figure is taken from a very perfect specimen in my own collection.\r\n\r\nIt is an African weapon, not used for war, but for hunting, and, as far\r\nas I know, exclusively employed against the elephants. These animals\r\nhave a way of forming roads or tracks for themselves through the woods,\r\nvery much like those almost invisible paths which are made by the\r\nhalf-wild sheep of the great Wiltshire Downs, except that they traverse\r\nthick forests instead of broad downs.\r\n\r\nThe native hunters know all the elephant paths, and if a herd of\r\nelephants be seen approaching, the path which they will take is\r\ntolerably certain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANGROVE SEEDS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIPPOPOTAMUS TRAP AND ELEPHANT SPEAR.]\r\n\r\nArmed with this knowledge, the native hunters climb the trees, and seat\r\nthemselves on the branches which overhang the path, each hunter being\r\nsupplied with one of these spears. As the elephants pass beneath him,\r\nthe experienced hunter selects a bull elephant with good tusks, and,\r\ntaking a careful aim, drops the spear on its back.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the stroke, the elephant rushes off in mixed terror and\r\nrage. As the animal uses the legs of each side alternately, it sways its\r\nhuge body from side to side at every step. With each movement, the spear\r\nalso sways about, its weighted end giving it such a leverage, that the\r\nsharp edges of the head cut the poor animal to pieces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER kind of Fall-trap, which is common in many parts of Southern\r\nAfrica, is not dependent upon the skill of the hunter, but, like the\r\n“booby-trap” above mentioned, is set in motion by the victim.\r\n\r\nA figure of this trap is given in the illustration.\r\n\r\nIf the native hunter can find a spot where the Hippopotamus path passes\r\nunder an overhanging branch, he makes a simple but most effective trap.\r\nHe takes a heavy log of wood, and into one end of it he drives a\r\nspear-point. The log is then hung with its point downwards to the\r\nbranch, the rope which is connected with its trigger or catch being\r\nstretched across the path at a few inches from the surface of the\r\nground, and carried at right angles across the path.\r\n\r\nThe Hippopotamus takes no notice of the cord, which is usually made of\r\none of the creepers or “bush-ropes” that are so common in hot countries.\r\nNo sooner, however, does its foot strike the cord, than the trigger is\r\nreleased, and down falls the heavy log, driving its iron point deeply\r\ninto the back of the victim. Even if the weapon were simple iron, such a\r\nwound must be mortal, but, as it is almost invariably poisoned, the\r\nwounded animal can scarcely travel forty or fifty yards before it lies\r\ndown and dies.\r\n\r\nOne of these traps is shown in the illustration. In the foreground is\r\nshown the Fall-trap, pointed with iron, and weighted with large stones\r\nat the lower end, so as to bring it down with more force, and to prevent\r\nit from falling transversely.\r\n\r\nThe Spring-gun, once so formidable a protector of our coverts, was\r\nmanaged in a similar manner, except that the missile was discharged\r\nhorizontally, and not vertically. The gun, loaded with shot, was fixed\r\nsome eighteen inches from the ground, and a long and slight wire\r\nfastened to the trigger. The opposite end of the wire was made fast to a\r\ntree or other fixed object, and, as the gun was directed on the line of\r\nthe wire, it is evident that any one who stumbled against it would\r\ndischarge the gun, and receive the contents in his legs.\r\n\r\nIn France the gun was generally loaded with little pieces of bay salt,\r\nand I very much pity the unfortunate poacher who came across one of\r\nthese guns. The pain would prevent him from escaping, and I think that\r\nthe hardest-hearted of game preservers could not bring himself to\r\nprosecute a man who had already suffered so much.\r\n\r\nOf a similar character are the Spring-bows which were once common in\r\nthis country, and are still used in various parts of Asia. A bow and\r\narrow are substituted for firearms, and the bow, after being drawn by\r\nthe united efforts of several men, is held in its position by a stick,\r\none end of which presses against the centre of the bow, and the other\r\nagainst the string.\r\n\r\nA large arrow is then placed on the bow, and a cord is tied to the\r\nmiddle of the stick, led forwards in a line with the direction of the\r\narrow, and fastened, as in the case of the spring-gun. As soon as the\r\nline is struck, the stick is jerked from its place, and the arrow is\r\ndischarged, piercing the body of the trespasser. Tigers, bears, and\r\nleopards are the usual victims of this trap.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is remarkable that in the same country there is a production of\r\nNature which may in all probability have given to the native hunter the\r\nidea of the Fall-trap. This is the Mangrove-tree, which is remarkable\r\nfor the wonderful extent of ground which it will cover, and the nearly\r\nimpenetrable thickets which it forms. In the present part of the work we\r\nhave nothing to do with the aërial roots, several of which are shown in\r\nthe illustration, and only restrict ourselves to the Seeds, and the\r\ncurious manner in which they are planted by Nature.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration, on the left hand, the growth of the Mangrove is\r\nseen. The drawing is taken from a sketch by the late Mr. Baines, and\r\ngenerously placed at my disposal, as were all his drawings and journals.\r\n\r\nThe Mangrove is a wet-loving tree, never flourishing unless rooted in\r\nmud; and whether the moisture of the mud be attributable to fresh or\r\nsalt water seems to make little difference to the Mangrove, which, of\r\nthe two, appears to prefer the latter. Now, the seeds of the Mangrove\r\nlook very much like elongated skittles, except that one end comes to a\r\nsharp point. As they hang on the tree, the point is downwards. When they\r\nare ripe, they fall from the branch, and by their own weight are driven\r\ndeeply into the mud, where they develop roots and leaves, and become the\r\nprogenitors of the future Mangrove race.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that the native hunter, having seen the tremendous\r\nforce with which the Mangrove seed buries itself in the mud, has applied\r\nthe same principle to a weapon which shall bury itself in the body of an\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AND HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCONCEALMENT.--DISGUISE.--THE TRENCH.--POWER OF GRAVITY.--MISCELLANEA.\r\n\r\n     Concealment needed in Modern Warfare.--Concealment by\r\n     Covering.--Masking Guns.--Birnam Wood.--The Reduvius.--The\r\n     Cuckoo-spit and the Spider-crab.--Concealment by\r\n     Disguise.--Stratagem of the Barea.--Complete Deception.--Larva of\r\n     Geometra.--The Leaf-insect.--The Luppet-moth.--The Ptarmigan and\r\n     the Ermine.--Principle of the Trench.--The Hunter’s “Skärm.”--The\r\n     Wax-moth or Galleria-moth, and its Tunnel.--Fate of a\r\n     Collection.--The Termites and the Travelling Ants of South\r\n     America.--The Power of Gravity.--The Battering-ram and its\r\n     Force.--Miscellanea.--War by Suffocation.--The Stink-pot.--The\r\n     Chili-plant.--The Sulphur-room.--The Bombardier-beetle.--The\r\n     Bullet-making Machine and the Silkworm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCEALMENT.\r\n\r\nWe will first take Concealment by means of Covering.\r\n\r\nIf History repeats herself, so does Warfare. I have already shown the\r\nrepetition of History in the Fortress--I shall now show it in the Field.\r\n\r\nIn former days, when arms of precision were not invented, concealment\r\nwas not needed. No soldier ever was visited with a dream so wild as that\r\nof taking definite aim at the enemy, and reserving the fire until the\r\naim was certain. I have in my collection several of the French and\r\nEnglish muskets used about the time of Waterloo, and, though a fair\r\nrifle-shot, would not engage to hit a haystack with either of them at a\r\ndistance of a hundred yards. With the Snider or Martini-Henry in the\r\nhands of a skilful adversary, he would be a bold man who would offer\r\nhimself for a target at a thousand yards. Indeed, if the first shot\r\nhappened to miss, the marksman would be tolerably sure to notice the\r\nfailure, and to correct his aim with fatal certainty.\r\n\r\nIn those days, therefore, concealment was rather ridiculed than praised,\r\nthe power of the new arm not being as yet appreciated. I well recollect,\r\nin the earliest days of the Volunteer movement, hearing a Volunteer\r\ncaptain declare, amid the cheers of his company, that “he had never\r\nsneaked behind a tree in all his life, and was not going to begin now.”\r\n\r\nIn the present day, the power of the missile has been developed with\r\nsuch astounding rapidity, that to be exposed to the fire of rifles or\r\ncannon is almost certain death. Indeed, the only safety of the defence\r\nlay in the fact that the smoke soon rendered very accurate shooting\r\nimpossible at long ranges, and that at short ranges, if a man got a\r\nbullet through his body, it mattered little to him whether the missile\r\nwere a spherical musket-ball or a conical rifle-bullet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REDUVIUS (MAGNIFIED).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUCKOO-SPIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIDER-CRAB.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASKING GUNS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRNAM WOOD.]\r\n\r\nJust, then, as forts have latterly sunk into the earth for the purpose\r\nof strength, so have our modern soldiers found that the true principle\r\nof modern warfare is never to lose sight of the enemy, and never to\r\nallow the enemy to see yourself or the disposal of your troops.\r\n\r\nEverything must be revealed to the commander-in-chief, everything must\r\nbe concealed from the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the late Franco-German war the principle of concealment was largely\r\nused, and when cannon were brought into the field by the Germans for the\r\npurpose of attacking fortresses, they were always hidden under branches\r\nof trees, so that the enemy should not distinguish them from the\r\nordinary features of the country, and that the sparkle of the sunbeams\r\nupon them might not be seen.\r\n\r\nIt would be almost superfluous to remind the reader of Malcolm’s\r\nstratagem when besieging Dunsinane Castle:--\r\n\r\n    “Let every soldier hew him down a bough,\r\n     And bear’t before him; thereby shall we shadow\r\n     The numbers of our host, and make discovery\r\n     Err in report of us.”\r\n\r\nPrecisely similar modes of concealment are to be found in the animal\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain insect belonging to the Heteroptera, and\r\nscientifically named _Reduvius personatus_. I am not aware whether it\r\nhas any popular name. It is insectivorous, and ought to be welcomed in\r\nhouses, as it is particularly fond of the too common bed-bug. So\r\ncarnivorous are these insects that one of the Reduviidæ killed and\r\nsucked a companion of her own sex, her own mate, and, after only a few\r\ndays’ fast, her own young, and then sucked her own eggs.\r\n\r\nDuring its larval and pupal stages of existence, the Reduvius covers its\r\nbody and limbs with dust and any other refuse which it can find. In this\r\nmanner it disguises its form so completely that it scarcely looks like\r\nan insect. Occasionally it seems to be dissatisfied with its coat of\r\ndust, throws it off, and sets to work at a new one.\r\n\r\nOne of these creatures, as it appears when covered with its dusty\r\ncoating, is seen in the upper left-hand corner of the illustration. It\r\nis slightly magnified.\r\n\r\nBelow the Reduvius is the common Cuckoo-spit (_Aphrophora spumaria_),\r\nwhose frothy masses are so plentiful in our hedgerows and gardens.\r\n\r\nIf one of these masses be carefully opened, there will be found in it a\r\nlittle green creature with small, round, dot-like eyes. This is either\r\nthe larval or pupal state of the Frog-hopper, as the insect is called\r\nin its perfect state, from its habit of taking long and sudden leaps\r\nwhen alarmed.\r\n\r\nI well remember my delight when, as a child, I set to work at examining\r\nthese froth-masses, and succeeded in tracing the insect through all its\r\nchanges. The froth is derived from the sap of the tree, which is sucked\r\nthrough the proboscis, passed through the digestive organs, and then\r\nejected in a succession of little bubbles. After awhile a little drop of\r\nclear liquid is seen to collect at the bottom of the froth, to increase,\r\nand then to fall, when another immediately begins to be formed. One\r\nspecies of Cuckoo-spit, which inhabits Madagascar, acts almost like a\r\nsiphon on the tree, and pours out large quantities of clear water during\r\nthe hottest part of the day.\r\n\r\nWithin this froth-mass the insect lies concealed, and, though utterly\r\nhelpless, is safe from most of the enemies that would attack it if it\r\nwere left exposed.\r\n\r\nBeneath the Cuckoo-spit is the common Spider-crab, sometimes called the\r\nThornback-crab, from the numerous spines with which its body is covered.\r\nIts scientific name is _Maia squinado_.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spider-crab attains to a tolerable size, its rough surface\r\nforms attachment for various marine beings, chiefly those belonging to\r\nthe zoophytes. In some cases these zoophytes grow to such a size that\r\nthe Crab is completely covered by them, and its original shape\r\neffectually concealed. When one of these creatures is seen in a living\r\nstate it presents the curious spectacle of a large bunch of zoophytes\r\nand corallines moving about from place to place without any perceptible\r\nlimbs, the whole of the surface of the Crab being covered with\r\nextraneous growths.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISGUISE.\r\n\r\nNext comes concealment by means of Disguise.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the accompanying illustration is shown a singular\r\nmode of concealment adopted by the Barea, a warlike and predatorial\r\ntribe of Abyssinia. When Mr. Mansfield Parkyns was resident in Abyssinia\r\nhe fell in with the Barea, through whose country he had to pass.\r\n\r\n“Scarcely had we passed the brook of Mai-Chena when one of our men, a\r\nhunter, declared that he saw the slaves. Being at that time\r\ninexperienced in such matters, I could see nothing suspicious. He then\r\npointed out to me a dead tree standing on an eminence at a distance of\r\nseveral hundred yards, and charred black by last year’s fire.” Here I\r\nmust explain that in Abyssinia, as in several other parts of the world,\r\nthe ground is annually, cleared of its superabundant vegetation by\r\nsetting fire to it, and allowing the flames to burn themselves out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAF-INSECT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PTARMIGAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATERPILLAR OF GEOMETRA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAPPET-MOTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAREA STRATAGEM.]\r\n\r\n“However, all I saw was a charred stump of a tree and a few blackened\r\nlogs or stones lying at its feet. The hunter declared that neither the\r\ntree nor the stones were there the last time we passed, and that they\r\nwere simply naked Barea, who had placed themselves in that position to\r\nobserve us, having no doubt seen us for some time, and prepared\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“I could scarcely believe it possible they could be so motionless, and\r\ndetermined to explore a little. The rest of the party advised me to\r\ncontinue quietly in the road, as it was possible that, from our\r\npresenting a rather formidable appearance, we should pass unmolested;\r\nbut so confident was I of his mistake, that, telling the rest to go on\r\nslowly, as if nothing had been observed, I dropped into the long grass\r\nand stalked up towards them.”\r\n\r\n“A shot from my rifle at a long distance (I did not venture too close)\r\nacted on the trees and stones as powerfully as the fiddle of Orpheus,\r\nbut with the contrary effect; for the tree disappeared, and the stones\r\nand logs, instead of running after me, ran in the opposite direction.”\r\n\r\n“I never was more astonished in my life, for so complete was the\r\ndeception that even up to the time I fired I could have declared the\r\nobjects before me were vegetable or mineral--anything, indeed, but\r\nanimal. The fact was that the cunning rascals who represented stones\r\nwere lying flat, with their little round shields placed before them as\r\nscreens.”\r\n\r\nThis stratagem is shown on the right hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left are a few of the innumerable instances in Nature where\r\nConcealment is obtained by imitation.\r\n\r\nThe three examples which are here given are familiar to all\r\nentomologists.\r\n\r\nThe upper figure represents two of the Geometra or Looper Caterpillars,\r\nas they appear when at rest, and affixed to a twig. This appears to be a\r\nsingular attitude of rest, but it is one in which they delight, and in\r\nwhich they remain for hours together, the claspers at the end of the\r\nbody tightly grasping the branch, and the whole body held out so\r\nstraight and motionless that it is hardly possible to believe that a\r\nveritable twig is not before the eye. The colour is that of the twig,\r\nand the different segments of the body look exactly like the little\r\nirregularities and projections of a young twig.\r\n\r\nI have more than once seen a novice in entomology unable to distinguish\r\nthese larvæ, even when the branch was pointed out, and there were\r\nseveral upon it.\r\n\r\nJust below the Loopers, and on the left hand of the illustration, is\r\nshown the well-known Leaf-insect (_Phyllium_). These strange beings have\r\nthe elytra and the flattened appendages of the legs so exactly like\r\nleaves that the most experienced eye can scarcely distinguish them from\r\nthe leaves among which they are placed. Even when they have been on a\r\nsmall plant, such as a myrtle in a flower-pot, I have had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in finding them, and have seen people examine the plant, and\r\nthen go away declaring that no insects were on it.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand, and just below the looper caterpillar, is the common\r\nLappet-moth of this country, shown in its position of rest.\r\n\r\nWhen it assumes this attitude, it looks exactly like a withered leaf,\r\nthe resemblance extending not only to the form, but the colour. All\r\nentomologists are familiar with many similar examples in insect life.\r\nThe common Tortoise-shell Butterfly, for example, has a way of settling\r\non patches of red soil, with which it harmonizes so well that it can\r\nhardly be seen. The various moths, also, are in the habit of resting on\r\ntree-bark, palings, and other objects, to which they instinctively know\r\nthat they assimilate in hue. Many a beginner in entomology will pass a\r\nwooden fence or a wall, and not see an insect on either, while an adept\r\nwill follow him and take twenty or thirty good specimens.\r\n\r\nThe last figure in the illustration represents a Ptarmigan (_Lagopus\r\nvulgaris_) in its winter dress. These birds have two differently\r\ncoloured dresses, one for summer and the other for winter, and both\r\nadapted for concealment by imitation. In the former dress it is mottled\r\nwith various shades of blackish brown, yellow, and white. As the bird is\r\nin the habit of settling among the grey lichen-covered stones on the\r\nsides of rocky hills, these colours harmonize so exactly with them that\r\na Ptarmigan may almost be trodden upon before it is perceived.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, when the snow covers the whole country with one uniform\r\nsheet of white, except where the wind blows the snow aside, and exposes\r\nthe underlying stones, the Ptarmigan assumes a different plumage, being\r\nalmost entirely white, except a black streak over the eye, and the outer\r\nfeathers of the tail, which are also black. Thus the bird becomes almost\r\nindistinguishable from a snow-covered stone, especially as it has a\r\nhabit of squatting motionless and silent when it takes alarm.\r\n\r\nThe reader may, perhaps, remember that the common Stoat also has a\r\nsummer and winter dress. The ordinary colour is rich reddish brown\r\nabove, and white beneath, with a black tip to the tail. In the severe\r\nwinters of Northern Europe the Stoat exchanges his ruddy coat for one of\r\npure white, and is then known by the name of Ermine. It is remarkable\r\nthat in the winter dress both of the Ptarmigan and Stoat the tail is\r\nblack, while the rest of the coat is white.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRENCH.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a third mode of concealment in war, namely, that which is\r\nobtained by means of Trenches or Pits.\r\n\r\nEven in hunting the pit or partial trench is largely used. In Southern\r\nAfrica the hunter often employs such a trench, called technically a\r\n“Skärm.” It is very simple in idea, and easily made, being based on the\r\nprinciple that lions, elephants, &c., look for their assailants on the\r\nlevel of the earth, and seldom, if ever, look above or below it.\r\nAccordingly the hunter, having marked some pool or lake whereunto the\r\nwild animals resort at night to quench their thirst, chooses a\r\nconvenient spot, and there digs a trench some seven feet in length and\r\nfour deep, and covers it in with stout tree-branches and logs of various\r\nsize. The whole is roofed in with sods, and the only entrance is at one\r\nend.\r\n\r\nHere the hunter sits and waits, and, as his ear is on a level with the\r\nsurface of the ground, he can hear at a considerable distance sounds\r\nwhich would have escaped him had he been erect.\r\n\r\nWaiting for a favourable opportunity, as the various beasts come to\r\ndrink, the hunter chooses one, takes careful aim, and fires one of his\r\nheaviest guns. It is but seldom that the rest of the animals charge in\r\nthe direction of the Skärm, but even if they do, the hunter is quite\r\nsafe under the shelter of his strong roof, which is able to resist even\r\nthe heavy tread of an elephant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galleria-Moth (Larva).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Military Trench.]\r\n\r\nIn modern warfare, and especially during sieges, the trench is largely\r\nused, and is constructed on the most scientific principles, so as to\r\nshelter the assailants, while enabling them to proceed nearer and nearer\r\nto the fortress. A portion of one of these trenches is shown in the\r\nright hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the opposite side of the same illustration is shown the same\r\nprinciple as carried out in Nature.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain little insect, called the Wax-moth, or Galleria-moth\r\n(_Galleria alvearia_), which, although quite harmless in its perfect\r\nform, is in its larval state extremely injurious to beehives.\r\n\r\nThe mother moth contrives, aided by her tiny form and sombre colouring,\r\nto slip past the sentries at the mouth of the hive, and to lay her eggs\r\namong the combs. This done, she dies, but the evil of her visit lives\r\nafter her.\r\n\r\nEach of the eggs is hatched into a little caterpillar, having a soft\r\ngrey body, but a hard, horny head of a black-brown colour. As soon as\r\nthey are hatched they begin to feed, eating not only the waxen combs,\r\nbut the honey and the bee-bread which were intended for the support of\r\nthe legitimate inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe reader may ask why the bees do not destroy this marauder on their\r\npremises. They would be only too glad to do so, but they cannot touch\r\nit. As it eats its way along, it constructs a strong silken tube, within\r\nwhich it lives, and which it gradually lengthens. This tube or gallery\r\nis exceedingly tough, and perfectly capable of resisting the bee’s\r\nsting. Moreover, the caterpillar traverses its tube with such rapidity\r\nthat the bee has no chance of knowing whereabouts the caterpillar may be\r\nwhen it makes its attack. When it feeds it only protrudes its armed\r\nhead, the horny covering of which is an effectual protection against the\r\nsting.\r\n\r\nWhen these creatures fairly get hold of a hive, the damage which they do\r\nis terrible, the whole of the combs being enveloped in the\r\never-increasing labyrinth of tubes. Even the bees themselves fall\r\nvictims to the Galleria-moth, for the silken tunnels are driven through\r\nand through the combs, enveloping the broad cells as in the meshes of a\r\nnet. Consequently, when the young bees are developed, they cannot escape\r\nfrom their cells, and perish miserably.\r\n\r\nNor do these tiresome insects confine themselves to hives; but they have\r\nan extraordinary facility for discovering bee-combs after they are\r\nremoved from the hive. Some years ago I was making a collection of\r\nvarious insect habitations, and had brought together a carefully\r\nselected set of combs, showing the internal structure of the hive, and\r\nthe different cells which are inhabited by the worker, the drone, and\r\nthe queen bee.\r\n\r\nOne day, when about to arrange the collection in a glass case, I found\r\nthat the whole of the combs had been destroyed by the Wax-moth. Scarcely\r\na square inch of comb remained, and the contents of the box were little\r\nmore than a congeries of Wax-moth galleries. Even the Wasp and Hornet\r\nnests which had been placed in the same box had been attacked, and,\r\nalthough they had not been so utterly destroyed as the waxen cells, they\r\nhad been sufficiently injured to render them unfit for exhibition.\r\n\r\nMany other insects work on the same principle. Certain Termites, for\r\nexample, construct tunnels of clay, in order to conceal them on their\r\ntravels, and have the art, even in the hottest and driest weather, of\r\nmixing their clay with some liquid which renders it, when dry, nearly as\r\nhard as stone. Indeed, there have been instances where the Termites have\r\nattacked the wooden beams of houses, and literally transformed them into\r\nbeams of stone.\r\n\r\nThen there are many Ants, notably several species of South America,\r\nwhich cover their approach by tunnels, and never venture into the open\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVITY AS A PROPULSIVE AGENT.\r\n\r\nThe two figures on the accompanying illustration will almost speak for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the same force of gravitation which causes the\r\navalanche to thunder down the precipice may be utilised as a means of\r\nprojecting missiles in time of war. When, however, the stones or beams\r\nwere once sent on their destructive mission, they were out of the\r\ncontrol of those who launched them. We now come to a modification of the\r\nforce of Gravity, by which the missile, if we may so term it, is kept\r\nunder control, its power increased or diminished at will, and its point\r\nof attack shifted according to the requirements of the moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ram.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Head of Battering-Ram.]\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of artillery, the Battering-ram was by far the most\r\nformidable engine that could be brought against a fortified place. The\r\nprinciple of the Battering-ram was simple enough. A long and heavy\r\nbeam, generally the trunk of a tree, was suspended by ropes at the\r\ncentre of gravity, so that it could be swung backwards and forwards.\r\nAlthough a simple beam was an effective weapon, its value was much\r\nenhanced by loading the thickest end with a heavy mass of metal, usually\r\niron, and, when there was time for adornment, roughly modelled into the\r\nform of a ram’s head.\r\n\r\nGenerally the Battering-ram was mounted on an elevated platform, and the\r\nsoldiers who worked it protected by a roof, which was called by the name\r\nof Testudo, or Tortoise. The force of this weapon was tremendous, and no\r\nwall, however strong, could resist it. Sometimes the beam was\r\nconsiderably more than a hundred feet in length, being composed of\r\nseveral pieces bolted and banded together with iron.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that such a weapon as this must have been a\r\nmost terrible one, and, indeed, the whole success of the siege\r\npractically depended upon it. The assailants did their best to bring the\r\nBattering-ram into position under the walls, and the besieged did their\r\nbest either to keep it away, or to neutralise its effects by catching it\r\nwith nooses, dropping large stones upon it so as to break or dismount\r\nit, or, if they could not succeed in either of these attempts, they\r\ndeadened the force of its blows as well as they could by interposing\r\nlarge sacks of wool between the wall and the head of the ram.\r\n\r\nConsidering the style of architecture which was then used in\r\nfortification, namely, a combination of height with thickness, the force\r\nof the Battering-ram would be even greater than that of artillery. The\r\nregular and rhythmical swing of the ram would soon communicate a\r\nvibratory motion to the wall, which would of itself tend to disintegrate\r\nthe whole structure, while the blows of the iron head beneath broke away\r\nthe stones, and rendered the downfall of the fort a mere matter of time.\r\n\r\nThe reader need hardly be reminded that the Battering-ram was so called\r\nbecause its mode of attack was practically the same as that of the\r\nanimal from which it took its title.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEA.\r\n\r\nBy slow degrees, mankind, as they advance in civilisation, have robbed\r\nwarfare of many horrors. Non-combatants, for example, are now left\r\nunharmed. Poisoned weapons have, by common consent, been abolished, and\r\nso have those instruments of warfare which, though they do not simply\r\npoison the blood by means of bodily wounds, do so by means of noxious\r\nvapours poured into the lungs.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes rather unfortunate when civilisation and semi-barbarism\r\nmeet in battle; the former respecting the customs of honourable warfare,\r\nand the latter ignoring them. For example, in olden times, one of the\r\nmost potent weapons in naval combat was the “stink-pot”--_i.e._ a vessel\r\nfilled with sulphur and other ingredients, and emitting a smoke which\r\nwas death when inhaled. Among the American Indians the well-known\r\nChili-plant was much used for this purpose, the very first breath that\r\nwas taken of the thin and almost invisible smoke causing the throat to\r\ncontract as if clutched by a strong hand. If then any enemies had taken\r\nrefuge in a cave, or were suspected of having done so, a fire was\r\nlighted at the entrance, a quantity of chilis thrown on it, and the rest\r\nleft to time. No being could endure that smoke and live, and they must\r\neither stay in the cave and die, or come out and deliver themselves up\r\nto their foes. The former was the better part to take, as suffocation,\r\nhowever slow, is only an affair of a few minutes, while death by torture\r\nis prolonged through hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bombardier-Beetle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chinese Stink-Pots.]\r\n\r\nIn the late Chinese war the stink-pot was extensively used, and our\r\nsailors took it in very bad part that the enemy should be allowed to\r\nemploy such weapons, and they should be debarred from using them.\r\n\r\nWhether this principle is still retained in the defence of fortresses I\r\ndo not know. I recollect, however, some twenty years ago, going over a\r\nfortress in which suffocation was employed as a means of defence. A long\r\ngallery was so placed that the assailants were tolerably sure to force\r\ntheir way into it, thinking that it led to the interior of the fort.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, nothing but a trap, for it had no exit. As soon as a\r\nnumber of the assailants had poured into this trap, their exit was\r\nsuddenly cut off by machinery provided for the purpose, and at the same\r\ntime a quantity of sulphur and lighted charcoal was shot into the\r\ngallery from above, and the aperture instantly closed. It would be\r\nabsolutely impossible that any one who had been enclosed in that\r\nterrible chamber should escape with life, for the first breath of that\r\ndeadly vapour would render the strongest man insensible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATURE, as usual, has anticipated Art even in this particular.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of England, and especially along the shores of the\r\nThames towards Gravesend, a little beetle is to be found under the flat\r\nstones of the river bank. Its scientific name is _Brachinus crepitans_.\r\nWhen this insect is alarmed, it has the power of ejecting a peculiar\r\nliquid, which, when it comes in contact with the atmosphere, bursts into\r\na sort of pale blue-green flame, followed by a kind of smoke. Sometimes,\r\nwhen a tolerably large stone is lifted, the little explosions will go\r\npopping about in a most curious manner. Indeed, they carry reminiscences\r\nof school days, when it was a joy to distribute single grains of coarse\r\ngunpowder on the bars of the grate, and watch them melt, take fire,\r\nexplode, and send forth little clouds of smoke. The insect is popularly\r\ncalled the Bombardier-beetle. Whether or not this capability be given as\r\na means of defence I cannot say, but it assuredly answers that purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are several of the voracious Carabidæ, or Ground-beetles, which\r\nwould be very glad to make a meal of the Brachinus. When, however, the\r\nBombardier-beetle finds itself on the point of being overtaken, it\r\nelevates the abdomen with a peculiar gesture, and ejects the liquid. The\r\neffect on the pursuer is remarkable. It seems overwhelmed and stupefied\r\nby the sudden attack, moves about for awhile as if blinded, and, by the\r\ntime that it has recovered its sense, the Bombardier-beetle is out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nIn some of the hotter parts of the world there are several species of\r\nBombardier-beetles which attain considerable size, and their discharge\r\nis powerful enough to discolour the skin of the human hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI HAVE felt some little difficulty in classifying the curious invention\r\nwhich will now be described, but, as it is used for the purpose of\r\nmaking bullets, I have placed it in the category of War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILK APPARATUS OF SILKWORM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULLET-MAKING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nIn the days of “Brown Bess,” as the old musket used to be called,\r\nprecision of aim was not required, for no commander dreamt of opening\r\nfire until the enemy were at comparatively close quarters. In those days\r\nthe bullets were spherical, and cast in moulds. After a time, when the\r\nEnfield rifle displaced the musket, and did double the execution at\r\nthree times its range, bullets were still cast, though their shape was\r\naltered, and they took a sugar-loaf form instead of being spherical.\r\n\r\nThe rifle-testing machine at Woolwich, however, soon showed that at long\r\nranges a cast bullet was nearly useless, one part being always lighter\r\nthan another, and air-bubbles often taking the place of lead. After\r\nbeing cast, therefore, the bullets were placed in a “swedge,” or\r\n“swage,” _i.e._ a machine by which the lead was forcibly compressed\r\nuntil it was of a tolerably uniform density. Even this process, however,\r\ndid not insure absolute exactness, and then a machine was invented by\r\nmeans of which the process of casting was superseded, and the bullets\r\nwere pinched or squeezed, so to speak, out of cold lead.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration is a plan of the ingenious\r\napparatus by which the lead is supplied to the machine which actually\r\nforms the bullets. The sketch is not meant as a drawing of the actual\r\nmachine, but is merely intended to show the principle.\r\n\r\nThe chief parts in this machine are a hollow cylinder, a piston, and a\r\ndelivery tube. The cylinder is shown at A, and when used, is filled with\r\nmelted lead. The piston, B, is then forced upwards by hydraulic\r\npressure, driving the lead through the delivery tube. As it issues into\r\nthe air it hardens, and thus forms a solid rod of lead, C. This rod is\r\nthen passed into the next machine, where it is cut into regular lengths,\r\nand these pieces are then placed in moulds, and forced into form by\r\nenormous pressure. Were it not for this ingenious machinery, the\r\nwonderful scores which are now made at long distances would be\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW let us compare Art with Nature, as seen on the left hand of the\r\nillustration, which is a chart or plan of the spinning apparatus of the\r\nSilkworm.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the bullet-making machine at work, I at once perceived\r\nthat it was nothing more than a repetition in metal of the beautiful\r\nmechanism which I had so often admired in this insect. In order to show\r\nthe close analogies of the two objects, I have marked them with similar\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nA represents the upper part of the reservoir or vessel which contains\r\nthe silk in a liquid state, B B are the muscles which contract the\r\nreservoir and force the liquid matter out. It will be seen that both\r\nthese vessels terminate in a delivery tube, identical in office with\r\nthat of the bullet-making machine. As soon as the liquid silk passes\r\ninto the air it is hardened, and is formed into a silken rod, C, just as\r\nis the lead in the machine. The only difference between the two, if it\r\ncan be called a difference, is, that in the silkworm the rod is double,\r\nwhereas in the machine it is single. The principle, however, is\r\nidentical in both cases. The webs of spiders, and the threads by which\r\nso many caterpillars suspend themselves, and with which they make their\r\nnests, are all formed on the same design, namely, a reservoir containing\r\na liquid which is squeezed through a tube, and hardens when it comes in\r\ncontact with the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     THE HUT, TROPIC AND POLAR.--PILLARS AND FLOORING.--TUNNEL ENTRANCE\r\n     OF THE IGLOO.--DOORS AND HINGES.--SELF-CLOSING TRAP-DOORS.\r\n\r\n     Primitive Architecture evidently borrowed from the Lower\r\n     Animals.--Roof Hut of the Nshiego Mbouvé of Western\r\n     Africa.--Platform Hut of the Orang-outan of Borneo.--Lake Dwellers\r\n     and their Huts.--Tree-huts of Southern Africa, and their\r\n     Uses.--Ascendancy of the Wild Beast over Man.--Snow-hut of the Seal\r\n     copied by Esquimaux, and its Value shown.--Pillars and\r\n     Flooring.--Crypt and Cathedral.--The Cuttle “Bone” and its\r\n     many-pillared Structure.--The Wasp-nest, its Pillars and\r\n     Floors.--Tunnel Entrances to Igloo.--Sudden Formation of\r\n     Snow.--Nest of the Fairy Martin.--The Sand-wasp and its Mode of\r\n     Building.--Doors and Hinges.--Eggs of the Gnat and\r\n     Rotifer.--Cocoons of Ichneumon-flies.--Habitations of\r\n     Microgaster.--Trap-doors in Nature and Art.--Habitation of the\r\n     Trap-door Spider.--A Nest upon a Pillar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUT.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that mankind has borrowed from the lower\r\nanimals the first idea of a dwelling, and it is equally true, as we\r\nshall presently see, that not only primitive ideas of Architecture are\r\nto be found in Nature, but that many, if not all, modern refinements\r\nhave been anticipated.\r\n\r\nTo begin at the beginning. The first idea of a habitation is evidently a\r\nmere shelter or roof that will keep off rain from the inhabitant. When\r\nMr. Bowdich was travelling in Western Africa, he was told that the\r\nNjina--another name for the Gorilla--made huts for itself from branches,\r\nthe natives also saying that it defended these huts with extemporised\r\nspears. A more truthful account is given of the Mpongwe and Shekiani,\r\nnamely, that the animal builds a hut, but lives on the roof, and not\r\nunder it.\r\n\r\nAlthough this information has since proved to be false, there was a\r\nfoundation of truth in it, for there really is an ape in that part of\r\nAfrica which makes huts, or rather roofs, for itself. This animal is the\r\nNshiego Mbouvé (_Troglodytes calvus_).\r\n\r\nThis remarkable ape has a curious way of constructing a habitation.\r\nChoosing a horizontal branch at some distance from the ground for its\r\nresting-place, the animal erects above it a roof composed of fresh\r\nbranches, each laid over the other in such a way that rain would shoot\r\noff them as it does from a thatched roof. M. du Chaillu gives the\r\nfollowing account of this habitation:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF NSHIEGO MBOUVÉ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFRICAN TREE-HUT.]\r\n\r\n“As we were not in haste, I bade my men cut down the trees which\r\ncontained the nests of these apes. I found them made precisely as I have\r\nbefore described, and as I have always found them, of long branches and\r\nleaves laid one over the other very carefully and thickly, so as to\r\nrender the structure capable of shedding water.\r\n\r\n“The branches were fastened to the tree in the middle of the structure\r\nby means of wild vines and creepers, which are so abundant in these\r\nparts. The projecting limb on which the ape perched was about four feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n“There remains no doubt that these nests are made by the animal to\r\nprotect it from the nightly rains. When the leaves begin to dry to that\r\ndegree that the structure no longer sheds water, the owner builds a new\r\nshelter, and this happens generally once in ten or fifteen days. At this\r\nrate the Nshiego mbouvé is an animal of no little industry.”\r\n\r\nThe roof which this ape builds is from six to eight feet in diameter,\r\nand is tolerably circular, so that it looks something like a large\r\numbrella. When the animal is at rest it sits on the branch with one arm\r\nthrown round the stem of the tree, in order to support itself during\r\nsleep. In consequence of this attitude the hair is rubbed away on one\r\nside, thus earning for the ape the specific title of _calvus_, or bald.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is rather remarkable that the Orang-outan of Borneo is likewise a\r\nhouse-builder, though not in the same manner as the African ape which\r\nhas just been mentioned. This animal has a way of weaving together the\r\nbranches of trees, so as to make a platform on which it can repose, its\r\nenormously powerful arms being of great service in this task. The animal\r\nseems to make its platform in quite a mechanical manner, and it has been\r\nnoticed that when an Orang-outan has been mortally wounded, it has\r\nexpended its last energies in twisting the branches together so as to\r\nform a couch on which it can lie down and die.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPUTTING aside those cases where huts have been erected in trees by way\r\nof amusement, we may find instances where human beings have been forced\r\nto make their habitations in trees.\r\n\r\nIn some places, such as certain parts of South America, the natives are\r\nforced to make their houses in trees, partly on account of the climate,\r\nand partly for the purpose of avoiding the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThe delta of the Orinoco River is nearly half as large as England, and\r\nfor a considerable part of the year is deep in water. Yet this tract is\r\ninhabited by the Warau tribe, who find in it their only mode of escape\r\nfrom the tiny but terrible mosquito. We in England know but little of\r\nthe miseries inflicted by these insects, which are so plentiful in some\r\nparts of America that they are gathered in bags, pressed into thick\r\ncakes about as large as ordinary dinner-plates, and an inch in\r\nthickness, and then cooked and eaten.\r\n\r\nNow it is found that although the mosquito infests the banks of rivers,\r\nit cannot venture far from land. The Waraus, therefore, make for\r\nthemselves habitations which are far enough from land to baffle the\r\nmosquitoes, and near enough to be easily reached in canoes.\r\n\r\nFortunately for them, there is a tree called the Ita Palm, belonging to\r\nthe genus Mauritia, which loves moisture, and grows abundantly in this\r\ndelta. The Waraus, therefore, make their habitations in these trees,\r\nconnecting several of them together with cross-beams, and laying planks\r\nupon them so as to form the flooring of their simple huts. Here they\r\nmaintain themselves chiefly by fishing, but are sometimes obliged to\r\nvisit the mainland, in spite of the mosquitoes. When, however, they\r\nreturn, they halt at some distance from the shore, and with green boughs\r\ncarefully beat out every mosquito from the canoe before they dare to\r\napproach their dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe once-celebrated Lake Dwellers of Switzerland evidently lived after a\r\nsimilar fashion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN this case insects drive human beings into trees, but there are\r\ninstances where nobler animals have produced the same effect.\r\n\r\nSome years ago there lived in Southern Africa a powerful chief called\r\nMoselekatze, who spent his whole life in warfare, converting all the\r\nmale inhabitants into soldiers, dividing them into regiments, ruling\r\nthem with the extreme of discipline, and by their aid devastating the\r\nneighbouring countries. He swept off all the cattle, which constitutes\r\nthe wealth of the Kafir tribes, and either killed the male inhabitants\r\nor pressed them into his service.\r\n\r\nThe land was in consequence deprived of its natural defenders, and the\r\nwild beasts, especially the lions, increased rapidly, so that the\r\nposition of the survivors was a really terrible one. They had no cattle\r\nto furnish the milk which is the chief food of the Kafir tribes; their\r\nweapons had been taken by Moselekatze; and they were forced to live\r\nalmost entirely on locusts and wild plants. By degrees the lions became\r\nso numerous and daring, that the slight Kafir huts were an insufficient\r\nprotection during the night, and the disarmed and half-starved\r\ninhabitants were perforce obliged to make their habitations in trees.\r\n\r\nDr. Moffat, the well-known missionary, saw one tree in which there were\r\nno less than twenty huts. They were conical, and made of sticks and\r\ngrass, the base resting upon a platform or scaffold laid upon the fork\r\nof a horizontal branch. The only mode of approach to these huts was by\r\nnotches cut in the trunk of the tree.\r\n\r\nHow needful were these precautions was shown by the fact that the\r\nmissionary himself spent a night in one of these aërial huts, and had\r\nthe pleasure of hearing a number of lions snarl and growl all night over\r\na rhinoceros hump which he had placed in an oven made of a deserted\r\nant-hill. The oven, however, was too hot for the lions, and they had to\r\nretreat at daylight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSING from the tropics to the polar regions, we now take an instance\r\nwhere man has acknowledgedly copied an animal in the construction of his\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nIn Esquimaux-land, where no trees can grow, where for months together\r\nthe sun never rises above the horizon, where the temperature is many\r\ndegrees below zero, and where the land and ice are alike covered with a\r\nmantle of snow so thick that every landmark is abolished, it would seem\r\nthat no human beings could support life for one week. There is neither\r\ntimber for house-building nor wood for fuel, so that shelter, warmth,\r\nand cookery seem to be equally impossible, and as these are among the\r\nprime necessities of human life, it is not easy to see how mankind could\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW-HOUSE OF SEAL IN ESQUIMAUX-LAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW-HOUSE OF ESQUIMAUX.]\r\n\r\nYet these very regions are inhabited by sundry animals, and it is by\r\ncopying them that Man can keep his place. We have already seen how the\r\nEsquimaux hunter copies the Polar Bear, and we have now to see how he\r\ncopies the Seal in the material and form of his dwelling-house, and not\r\nonly contrives to live, but to enjoy life all the more for the singular\r\nconditions in which he is placed. Captain Hall mentions, in his “Life\r\nwith the Esquimaux,” that one of the natives, named Kudlago, who was\r\nreturning to his native country after visiting the United States, died\r\nwhile on board the ship. Towards the end of his life he was yearning for\r\nice, and his last intelligible words were, “Do you see ice? Do you see\r\nice?”\r\n\r\nOn the vast plains of ice that are formed in the winter-time the snow\r\nlies thickly, and yet upon such an inhospitable spot the mother seal has\r\nto make a home for her tender young. This she does in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\nShe has already preserved a “breathing hole” in the ice, through which\r\nshe can inhale air. How she finds so small a hole under the surface of\r\nthe ice, where there are no landmarks to guide her, is a marvel to every\r\nswimmer. She has to chase fish and follow them in all their winding\r\ncourses, and yet, when she is in want of air, is able to go straight to\r\nher breathing hole, and there take in a fresh supply of oxygen.\r\n\r\nWhen she is about to become a mother, she enlarges this breathing hole\r\nso as to make it into a perpendicular tunnel. She then, with the sharp\r\nnails of her fore-paws, or flippers, scoops away the snow in a dome-like\r\nform, as shown in the illustration, taking the snow down with her\r\nthrough the ice, and allowing it to be carried away by the water. By\r\ndegrees she makes a tolerably large excavation of a hemispherical shape,\r\nand when her young is born she deposits it on the ice-ledge around the\r\ntunnel. From ordinary foes the young Seal is safe, and nothing can\r\ndiscover the position of the house unless guided by the sense of smell.\r\n\r\nHow the Polar Bear and the Esquimaux hunter discover the dwelling and\r\ncapture the inmates we have already described in the chapter treating of\r\nWar and Hunting. Our present business is with the dwelling itself.\r\nComparatively few of these snow-houses, or _igloos_, as they are called,\r\nare discovered, and they remain intact until the summer sun melts the\r\nroof and exposes the habitation. By this time, however, the young Seal\r\nhas grown sufficiently to shift for itself, and no longer needs the\r\nshelter of a dwelling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE winter hut, or igloo, of the Esquimaux is made of exactly the same\r\nshape and of similar materials to the dwelling of the Seal, the chief\r\ndifference being that it is built instead of excavated.\r\n\r\nIn order to save time, the igloo is generally erected by two men, one of\r\nwhom supplies the material, and the other acts as bricklayer and\r\narchitect in one. Each begins by tracing a suitably sized circle in the\r\nsnow, which he clears away to some depth, so as to preserve a firm\r\nsurface, either as a floor or as the material for the wall. In this work\r\nboth men are equally valuable, for the skill required to cut the slabs\r\nof snow into such a shape that they can be formed into a hemispherical\r\ndome is quite as much as that which is needed for putting them together.\r\nI will call them the cutter and the builder. Sometimes a young hand is\r\nemployed by way of labourer, and passes the snow slabs to the builder as\r\nfast as they are cut.\r\n\r\nThe builder receives the slabs, and arranges them in regular order,\r\nalways taking care to “break the joints,” just as do our bricklayers of\r\nthe present day. Always remaining within the circle, he gradually builds\r\nhimself in, and when he has quite finished the house, he cuts a hole\r\nthrough the side, emerges, and, by the help of his partner, puts on the\r\nfinishing touches. He usually also adds a sort of tunnel to the door,\r\nthrough which any one must creep on his hands and knees if he wishes to\r\nenter the igloo. This part of Esquimaux architecture will presently be\r\nnoticed more in full.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may wish to know what provision there is for\r\nventilation. The answer is simple enough. There is none, the Esquimaux\r\nnot requiring ventilation any more than they require washing. The two,\r\nindeed, generally go together; and it may be observed, even in our own\r\ncountry, that those who object to fresh air, and are always complaining\r\nof draughts, have a very practical aversion to the use of fresh water,\r\nand but little confidence in what Thackeray calls the “flimsy artifices\r\nof the bath.”\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux never washes, and knows not the use of linen.\r\nConsequently, it is no matter of surprise that a sailor of Captain\r\nHall’s crew could not make up his mind to enter an igloo. “Whew!”\r\nexclaimed the man, “by thunder, I’m not going in _there_! It’s crowded,\r\nand smells horribly. How it looms up!”\r\n\r\nConsidering that there were inside that igloo a dozen Esquimaux, all\r\nfeasting on a raw, newly killed, and yet warm seal, the sailor had\r\nreason enough to decline a visit. Captain Hall, however, determined, in\r\nhis character of explorer, to brave the strange odours, and moreover to\r\njoin the inmates in their feast, knowing that as he would have to live\r\namong the Esquimaux for some two years, he would be forced to live as\r\nthey did, and might as well begin at once. Consequently on this resolve,\r\nhe drank the still steaming blood, and quaffed it from a cup which an\r\nEsquimaux woman had just licked clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOORS AND PILLARS.\r\n\r\nOne decided step in Architecture is the invention of the Pillar, and its\r\ncapabilities of aiding to sustain another floor above it. We see this\r\nprinciple carried out in our great cathedrals, where the use of the\r\nPillar is almost infinite. Take, for example, Canterbury Cathedral. A\r\nheedless visitor might easily pass through the nave, enter the choir,\r\nvisit the various side-chapels, and “Becket’s Crown,” without thinking\r\nthat under his feet is a vast chamber, and that the floor on which he\r\nstands is, in fact, the roof of a great crypt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASP-COMBS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLAVE SHIP.]\r\n\r\nThe weight of the Cathedral, with its lofty towers, is so tremendous,\r\nthat the building could not be erected simply upon the ground, but rests\r\nupon a complicated substratum of pillars and arches, whereby the weight\r\nis spread over a large surface. In fact, the Cathedral is really two\r\nbuildings, the one erected upon the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature there are many instances of pillars supporting different\r\nfloors. One of the most beautiful examples is to be seen in the common\r\nCuttle-bone, as it is called, this being the internal skeleton, if it\r\nmay be so termed, of the common Sepia (_Sepia officinalis_), which is so\r\noften found on our coasts, especially after a gale. This year (1875) I\r\nfound eight of these Cuttle-bones on the Margate sands, and all within a\r\nspace of some twelve feet square.\r\n\r\nThis so-called bone is really composed of the purest chalk, for which\r\nreason it is in great request as a dentifrice, being easily scraped to\r\nalmost impalpable powder when wanted, and not liable to be spilled, as\r\nis the case with any ordinary tooth-powder.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly light--so light, indeed, that it floats like a cork,\r\neven in fresh water. Now, as chalk is very much heavier than water, we\r\nmay naturally ask ourselves how this lightness is obtained. If the upper\r\nsurface be examined, it will be seen to be traversed by a vast number of\r\nwavy lines, something like the markings of “watered” silk. These show\r\nthe lines of demarcation between the multitudinous rows of pillars of\r\nwhich the whole structure is formed.\r\n\r\nIf the “bone” be sharply snapped in the middle, and the particles of\r\nwhite dust blown away, a wonderful structure presents itself, which can\r\nbe partially discerned by the naked eye, though a microscope is required\r\nto bring out its full beauties.\r\n\r\nEven with an ordinary pocket lens we can make out some of its wonders.\r\nThe object looks like a vast collection of basaltic columns, except that\r\nthe pillars are white instead of black, and they are arranged in rows\r\nwith the most perfect accuracy, just as if the place of each had been\r\nlaid down with rule and compass. They are scarcely thicker than ordinary\r\nhairs, but they are beautifully perfect, and rise in tier after tier as\r\nif they were parts of a many-storied building. As a definite space\r\nexists between the pillars, the reader will understand why the whole\r\nstructure should be so much lighter than water. In order, however, to\r\nsee these wonderful pillars in perfection, a very thin section should be\r\ntaken, and viewed with polarised light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER excellent example of Pillars and Flooring is to be found in the\r\nnests of various Wasps, including that of the Hornet.\r\n\r\nIn these nests the combs are arranged horizontally, and not vertically,\r\nlike those of the bees, and in consequence they have to be supported in\r\nsome way. This object is achieved by means of multitudinous pillars made\r\nof the same papier-mâché of which the combs are formed, and attached to\r\nthe successive rows of combs. There is, however, one curious point of\r\ndifference between the Wasp-comb and human architecture, namely, that\r\nthe pillars do not support floors, or rest upon them, but sustain the\r\nweight of those which hang from them. The mouths of the cells are all\r\ndownwards, and the combs are therefore suspended from the pillars,\r\ninstead of being supported by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUNNEL ENTRANCE TO THE DWELLING.\r\n\r\nWe have already found occasion to treat of the snow-house, or igloo, of\r\nthe Esquimaux, and have now to speak of a subsidiary, though necessary,\r\npart of Esquimaux architecture.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may have been unfortunate enough to travel by rail in\r\nthe depth of winter, and to be associated with fellow-passengers who\r\nwill insist on closing every window, even though the carriage be\r\ncrowded. Suppose that on such a day, the weather being perfectly fine,\r\nthe train stops at a station, and the guard outside opens the door to\r\nsee if another passenger can be accommodated with a place.\r\n\r\nNo sooner is the door opened than a shower of snow at once fills the\r\ncarriage. This is simply the moisture suspended in the air and generated\r\nby human lungs. The rush of cold air at once freezes this moisture and\r\nconverts it into snow, thus showing those who will condescend to learn,\r\nthat they have been breathing and re-breathing the air that has passed\r\nthrough a variety of human lungs, and is charged with their different\r\nmoistures. I have seen the same phenomenon at a dinner party, where,\r\nafter the withdrawal of the ladies, one of the windows was opened.\r\n\r\nNow, in Esquimaux-land, it is absolutely necessary to conserve every\r\natom of heat, for the cold is so intense that if a cask of water be near\r\na coal fire, only the part next the fire will be thawed, the rest being\r\nice. Cold, therefore, is a foe which has to be fought and kept away from\r\nthe household. Then there are other foes--such as Polar Bears, for\r\ninstance--which would be only too glad to get into an igloo and make a\r\nmeal of its inhabitants. The Esquimaux architect, therefore, avails\r\nhimself of an ingenious device by which he can set both foes at\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\nIn summer-time he contents himself with a hut made of skins, and merely\r\nhangs a skin over the entrance by way of a door. But in the winter, when\r\nhe is driven to his snow-house for shelter, he acts in a very different\r\nmanner. Instead of merely cutting an aperture for a door in the side of\r\nthe igloo, he constructs a long, low, arched tunnel, so small that no\r\none can enter the igloo except by traversing this tunnel on his hands\r\nand knees. Sometimes a number of huts are connected with each other, one\r\nor two tunnels leading into the air, and the rest serving merely as\r\npassages from one hut to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NESTS OF FAIRY MARTIN. TOWERS OF SAND-WASP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUTS OF ESQUIMAUX.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature are several examples of tunnels constructed on the same\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThere are, for instance, the curious nests of the Fairy Martin of\r\nSouthern Australia (_Hirundo Ariel_), which bear a singular resemblance\r\nto oil-flasks, the body of the nest being rather globular, and the only\r\nentrance being through a tolerably long, tunnel-like neck.\r\n\r\nThen there are the various Weaver-birds of Africa, with their\r\nlong-necked nests. Some of these strange edifices look almost like\r\nhorse-pistols suspended by the butt, so round is the nest, and so long\r\nand narrow is the tunnel-like entrance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSING to the insect world, we find the same principle carried out by\r\nthe now familiar Mason-wasp (_Odynerus murarius_), some of whose nests\r\nare represented in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThis insect makes a burrow, and at the bottom of it deposits an egg,\r\ntogether with a number of little caterpillars on which the grub, when\r\nhatched, will feed. The mother Wasp is not allowed to pursue this task\r\nwithout taking precautions against the admission of enemies to her\r\nburrow, especially the ichneumon-flies. As may be inferred from its\r\npopular name, the Sand-wasp always selects a sandy spot for its burrow,\r\nand generally chooses a piece of tolerably hard sandstone, which it is\r\nable to bite into little pellets, aided by a kind of liquid which it\r\nsecretes.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the manner in which the Mason-wasp forms and\r\ndefends its home is taken from the invaluable “Insect Architecture,” by\r\nRennie.\r\n\r\nThe author begins by describing the form and depth of the burrow, and\r\nthe soil in which it is made. He then proceeds to show the wonderful\r\nmanner in which the mother Wasp purveys food for the use of her future\r\nyoung whom she will never see. Guided by instinct, she places in the\r\nburrow exactly the number of caterpillars which the young Mason-wasp\r\nwill have to consume before it attains its perfect condition. It is\r\nbelieved that she partially paralyzes them with her sting before placing\r\nthem in the burrow. At all events, when they are once packed away, they\r\nnever move, so that the tiny Wasp grub can feed upon them quite at its\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nHere is Rennie’s account of the Sand-wasp and her burrow-making:--\r\n\r\n“When this wasp has detached a few grains of the moistened sand, it\r\nkneads them together into a pellet about the size of one of the seeds of\r\na gooseberry.\r\n\r\n“With the first pellet which it detaches, it lays the foundation of a\r\nround tower, as an outwork, immediately over the mouth of its nest.\r\nEvery pellet which it afterwards carries off from the interior is added\r\nto the wall of this outer round tower, which advances in height as the\r\nhole in the sand increases in depth. Every two or three minutes,\r\nhowever, during these operations, it takes a short excursion, for the\r\npurpose probably of replenishing its store of fluid wherewith to moisten\r\nthe sand. Yet so little time is lost, that Réaumur has seen a mason-wasp\r\ndig in an hour a hole the length of its body, and at the same time build\r\nas much of its round tower.\r\n\r\n“For the greater part of its height this round tower is perpendicular,\r\nbut towards the summit it bends into a curve, corresponding to the bend\r\nof the insect’s body, which, in all cases of insect architecture, is the\r\nmodel followed. The pellets which form the walls of the tower are not\r\nvery nicely joined, and numerous vacuities are left between them, giving\r\nit the appearance of filigree-work.\r\n\r\n“That it should be thus slightly built is not surprising, for it is\r\nintended as a temporary structure for protecting the insect while it is\r\nexcavating its hole, and as a pile of materials, well arranged and ready\r\nat hand, for the completion of the interior building,--in the same way\r\nthat workmen make a regular pile of bricks near the spot where they are\r\ngoing to build. This seems, in fact, to be the main design of the tower,\r\nwhich is taken down as expeditiously as it has been reared.\r\n\r\n“Réaumur thinks, that by piling in the sand which has previously been\r\ndug out, the wasp intends to guard its progeny for a time from being\r\nexposed to the too violent heat of the sun; and he has sometimes even\r\nseen that there were not sufficient materials in the tower, in which\r\ncase the wasp had recourse to the rubbish she had thrown out after the\r\ntower was completed. By raising a tower of the materials which she\r\nexcavates, the wasp produces the same shelter from external heat as a\r\nhuman being would who chose to inhabit a deep cellar of a high house.\r\n\r\n“She further protects her progeny from the ichneumon-fly, as the\r\nengineer constructs an outwork to render more difficult the approach of\r\nan enemy to the citadel. Réaumur has seen this indefatigable enemy of\r\nthe wasp peep into the mouth of the tower, and then retreat, apparently\r\nfrightened at the depth of the cell which she was anxious to invade.”\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that the Sand-wasp should be so anxious to insure the\r\nsafety of her nest, for her foes are multitudinous. Putting aside the\r\nordinary Ichneumon-flies, we have the predatory Tachinæ, which are\r\nalways hovering over such nests, and trying to deposit eggs therein. For\r\nmany years I have been in the habit of receiving letters from novices in\r\nentomology, wanting to know whether I am aware that the common Housefly\r\nis in the habit of acting as a parasite. Of course, the writer has\r\nmistaken the Tachina for a house-fly, but I cannot regret the fact that\r\nsome one has really begun to observe Nature, and not only to read books.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOORS AND HINGES.\r\n\r\nHaving seen that both in Nature and Art the entrances to dwellings are\r\nguarded by tunnel-like approaches, we come naturally to another mode of\r\nguarding the entrance, namely, by a door moving on hinges. As to the\r\nmultitudinous examples of doors and hinges in modern civilisation, we\r\nneed hardly discuss them, except to show the exact analogies which occur\r\nin Art and Nature.\r\n\r\nDoors moving on hinges are very plentiful in Nature, even where we\r\nshould least expect them. Take, for example, an egg, especially the egg\r\nof an insect, and we shall see that it is just about the last object in\r\nwhich we should expect to find a hinged door. Yet, if the reader will\r\nrefer to the illustration on page 7, he will see that the tiny eggs of\r\nthe common Gnat, numerous as they may be, are each furnished with a door\r\nwhich opens as soon as the inmate is hatched, and allows the little\r\nlarva to escape into the water.\r\n\r\nAnother still more remarkable instance of a hinged door in an egg is to\r\nbe found in one of the Rotifers, or Wheel-Animalcules, so called because\r\nthey possess an apparatus of movable cilia, which, when set in motion,\r\nlooks exactly like a wheel running round and round. As the full-grown\r\ncreature is barely one thirty-sixth of an inch in total length, the\r\nstructure of its eggs must be infinitesimally beyond the range of human\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nYet, just as the telescope sets at partial defiance the vast spaces that\r\nintervene between our earth and her sister planets, so the microscope\r\nperforms a similar task in the infinitesimally minute. And, under the\r\nall-revealing lens of the microscope, the little egg of the Brachionus,\r\nthough absolutely invisible to the unaided eye, yields up its secrets.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the shell is so transparent that the interior of the egg\r\ncan be seen through it as if it were a mere film of glass. The\r\nastonishing division and re-division of the yolk take place before our\r\neyes, being divided first into two, then into four, then into eight,\r\nthen into sixteen, then into thirty-two, and so on, until the whole mass\r\nof the yolk is cloven into divisions too numerous to count.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the form of the young Brachionus is developed within the\r\negg, even to the very teeth, which work away as persistently as if large\r\nstores of food were being passed through them.\r\n\r\nWhen the young is ready to take its place in the world, a new\r\ndevelopment occurs, which has been well related by Mr. Gosse:--\r\n\r\n“All these phenomena have appeared in the egg we are now watching; and\r\nat this moment you see the crystalline little prisoner, writhing and\r\nturning impatiently within its prison, striving to burst forth into\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n“Now, a crack, like a line of light, shoots round one end of the egg,\r\nand in an instant, the anterior third of the egg is forced off, and the\r\nwheels of the infant Brachionus are seen rotating as perfectly as if the\r\nlittle creature had had a year’s practice.\r\n\r\n“Away it glides, the very image of its mother, and swims to some\r\ndistance before it casts anchor, beginning an independent life. At the\r\nmoment of escape of the young, the pushed-off lid of the egg resumes its\r\nplace, and the egg appears nearly whole again, but empty and perfectly\r\nhyaline (_i.e._ all but transparent), with no evidence of its fracture,\r\nexcept a slight interruption of its outline, and a very faint line\r\nrunning across it.”\r\n\r\nTo pass from the egg to a more advanced stage in life. All practical\r\nentomologists have been greatly annoyed, in their earlier years of\r\ncollecting, to lose larva after larva, from the attacks of\r\nIchneumon-flies. It _is_ certainly rather beyond the limits of ordinary\r\npatience to discover, watch over, and secure successfully a rare\r\ncaterpillar, and then to find that it has been “stung” by an\r\nIchneumon-fly.\r\n\r\nThe veteran entomologist, however, troubles himself very little about\r\nsuch minor misfortunes, and, as a rule, more than compensates for them\r\nby preserving the intrusive Ichneumon-fly, and giving in his diary full\r\ndetails of the insect on which it was parasitic, of the plant on which\r\nthe caterpillar lived, the date of its appearance, and its numbers.\r\n\r\nNow, there are many of these parasitic insects, notably those belonging\r\nto the genus Microgaster, which invariably make doors in their cocoons.\r\nI have now before me groups of cocoons made of the two commonest British\r\nspecies, namely, _Microgaster glomeratus_ and _Microgaster alvearius_,\r\nand in both of them each tiny cocoon is furnished with a hemispherical,\r\nhinged door. I have also some exquisitely beautiful groups of\r\nMicrogaster cocoons found in the West Indies. They are the purest white,\r\nshine with a satiny lustre, and are arranged round a hollow centre, much\r\nas if they had been gummed to the outside of a very large thimble. There\r\nare many hundreds of them, and every one has its little door still open\r\nas it was when the fully developed insect first made its escape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER curious example of a natural door may be seen by those who will\r\nlook for it.\r\n\r\nOn plants infested with aphides, or “green blight,” as the gardeners\r\nquaintly term them, may often be seen dead aphides much larger than the\r\nrest, globular, brown, and shining. These aphides have been “stung,” as\r\nit is called, by a little Ichneumon-fly belonging to the genus Ophion,\r\nand having, like all its congeners, a flat and sickle-shaped abdomen.\r\nThe egg which has been laid in the aphis soon hatches, and the young\r\nOphion absorbs into itself all the juices of the aphis. It remains\r\nwithin the body of its involuntary host until it is fully developed,\r\nwhen it cuts a tiny, but beautifully perfect circular door in the skin,\r\nand emerges, leaving the door open and still attached by its little\r\nhinge.\r\n\r\nConsidering the small size of the aphis, and that the diameter of the\r\ndoor is only one-eighth of the length of the insect, the perfection of\r\nits form is really remarkable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nONE of the achievements of modern Architecture is the Self-closing Door,\r\nespecially where it must of necessity close by its own weight, and when\r\nthe fitting is so exact, that even the most experienced eye can\r\nscarcely detect it. Such a door is to be found guarding the nest of the\r\nTrap-door Spiders, several species of which are found scattered over all\r\nthe warm parts of the earth. A side view of one of these extraordinary\r\nnests is given in the accompanying illustration, and on the other side\r\nis the common trap-door of our cellars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOOR OF TRAP-DOOR SPIDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAP-DOOR OF COAL-CELLAR.]\r\n\r\nThe Spiders which make these extraordinary dwellings generally begin by\r\nexcavating a nearly perpendicular tunnel in the ground. They line it\r\nwith a silken web, and construct a door which exactly fits the orifice,\r\nand which is bevelled so that it shall not sink too far, and thus betray\r\nitself. I have seen and handled one, where the burrow had been sunk\r\namong lichens and mosses, and the trap-door of the nest had been most\r\ningeniously covered with the same growths. Although the surface of the\r\nslab of earth in which the nest was made is only a few inches square, it\r\nis almost impossible to detect the entrance, so admirably do the mosses\r\non the door correspond with those outside it.\r\n\r\nAlmost invariably the nest is sunk in the ground, but I have a specimen\r\nsent to me from India, in which the Spider must absolutely have carried\r\nthe clay to a fluted pillar, burrowed in it, and then made its beautiful\r\nhabitation. The nest and its inhabitant were sent to me by an officer in\r\nthe 108th Regiment, accompanied by the following letter:--\r\n\r\n“The packet contains a large Spider and the upper portion of its\r\npeculiar nest, the history of which is as follows.\r\n\r\n“On the thirtieth of last month (September, 1870), while searching for\r\ncaterpillars on a bush growing close to one of the pillars of my\r\nverandah, which is a very low one, reaching to within a foot of the\r\nground, I saw in part of the chunam masonry at the foot of the pillar\r\nwhat I at first sight took to be a couple of seeds sticking to a stone.\r\nOn trying to pull one off, I found that it came up with ease, bringing\r\nwith it what I thought was the stone.\r\n\r\n“But I had scarcely got it up when it was smartly pulled back. This\r\nexcited my curiosity, and I raised it again with a little force. I now\r\nsaw, to my wonder and admiration, that what I had fancied was a stone\r\nwas a small circular door with a pretty broad hinge, made all of silk;\r\nand then distinctly observed a large black spider dart down the hole to\r\nwhich the above door gave an entrance. But, not knowing the depth, I\r\nbroke it.\r\n\r\n“This piece I send to you, together with its original owner, who, at the\r\nbeginning of my digging operations, ran up suddenly, shut the door in my\r\nface, and hung on to it like grim death when I tried to reopen it. He\r\nsoon came away with the upper piece, still keeping the door resolutely\r\nclosed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     WALLS, DOUBLE AND SINGLE.--PORCHES, EAVES, AND WINDOWS.--THATCH,\r\n     SLATES, AND TILES.\r\n\r\n     The Wall and its Materials.--Bricks as they are and might\r\n     be.--Trade Unionism.--Double Walls and their Uses.--Double\r\n     Clothing.--The Refrigerator.--Cooking Vessels.--Fire-proof\r\n     Safes.--Cocoon of the Silkworm, and its treble Walls.--Nest of the\r\n     Little Ermine, Processionary, Gold-tailed, and Brown-tailed\r\n     Moths.--Mud Walls.--Nests of the Termite.--Porches, Eaves, and\r\n     Windows.--Nests of the Myrapetra and an Indian Ant.--The Sociable\r\n     Weaver-bird and its Nest.--Thatching.--Arms of the\r\n     Orang-outan.--Japanese and Chinese Rain-cloaks.--Eggs of the\r\n     Gold-tailed Moth.--Action of Fur.--Slates and Tiles.--Scales of\r\n     Butterfly’s Wing.--Shell of Tortoise.--Scales of Manis, Fish, and\r\n     Armadillo.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Walls of the house, in which there is more variety\r\nthan might be imagined.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, our modern houses of the “villa” type. They are\r\nnothing but the merest shells, made of the flimsiest imaginable\r\nmaterials. Some years ago, while walking through a suburb where some\r\nvery showy houses were being built, I amused myself by going over them\r\nand testing them. There was scarcely a room in which I could not thrust\r\nan ordinary walking-stick through the wall. When they were “finished”\r\nand “pointed,” the houses looked beautiful, but their heat in summer,\r\ncold in winter, and moisture in wet weather, can easily be imagined,\r\nespecially as the sand with which the mortar was mixed had been procured\r\nfrom the banks of a tidal river.\r\n\r\nThere is not the least necessity for such buildings. It is absurd to run\r\nup such edifices as that, and then charge £120 per annum for rent. The\r\nwhole system is as rotten as the houses, and there is nothing but\r\nprejudice and trade-unionism to prevent our houses being cool in summer,\r\nwarm in winter, and dry in all weathers.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that air is practically a non-conductor of heat, and\r\nthat therefore a layer of air between two very slight walls is just as\r\nwarm as if the wall had been made of solid stone. Now, there are several\r\ninventions whereby the present brick could be made half its present\r\nweight, twice its present strength, hard and smooth as earthenware, so\r\nthat it could not absorb water like our common brick, and pierced with\r\nholes through which air could pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF LITTLE ERMINE-MOTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, there is a stringent rule among brickmakers and\r\nbricklayers that they are to play into each other’s hands, and that no\r\nbricklayer is to touch a brick which has not been made in some definite\r\ndistrict. Should he do so, he is a marked man, and will stand but little\r\nchance of getting even a day’s work.\r\n\r\nThe power of the double wall may be seen in many ways. For example, in\r\nthe old days of coaching, when one had to pass hour after hour on the\r\nroof of the coach, it was known by practical experience that double body\r\nlinen, and two pairs of stockings, worn one over the other, formed the\r\nbest preparation for the journey. The reason was, that air became\r\nentangled between the layers of fabric, and acted as a non-conductor of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of utilising the principle of the double wall is seen in\r\nthe refrigerators which add so much to the comfort of the household in a\r\nhot summer. The one principle of these refrigerators is, to keep a layer\r\nof air between the ice and the surrounding atmosphere. The same\r\nprinciple may be used in a reverse way, and heat be preserved instead of\r\nrepelled. Those cooking-pots are now well known, where half-cooked meat\r\ncan be inserted in the morning, and at luncheon-time be turned out quite\r\nhot and perfectly cooked. The fact is, that the vessels in question are\r\ncovered with a very thick layer of felt. The felt, however, is only a\r\ndevice for entangling air, and a double wall would answer the purpose as\r\nwell, if not better.\r\n\r\nThe now well-known fire-resisting safes are made on this principle, and\r\nafter they have been for hours in a raging fire, and the outer case has\r\nbecome red-hot, the interior is quite safe, the papers uninjured, and\r\neven a watch continuing to go.\r\n\r\nThen there is the ordinary Ice-house, a sketch of which is given in the\r\nillustration. A pit is first dug in the ground, and thickly lined with\r\ndry branches, straw, &c. The roof is constructed in the same manner,\r\nonly the non-conducting power is increased by a thick coating of earth\r\nover the sticks and straw. The door, which is approached by a shelving\r\ncutting, is similarly protected, the covering only being removed when\r\nthe door is opened.\r\n\r\nI once made a very effective refrigerator out of two hampers, putting a\r\nsmall hamper inside a large one, and packing the space between them with\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature we find many examples of this principle, which enables the\r\ninhabitants to bid defiance to frost.\r\n\r\nA familiar example may be found in the cocoon of the common Silk-worm\r\n(_Bombyx mori_), and indeed in that of almost any silk-producing insect.\r\nWhen the caterpillar is about to make its cocoon, it begins by a number\r\nof rather strong threads attached to different points, and making a sort\r\nof scaffolding, so to speak, for the cocoon itself. Upon these is spun a\r\nslight outer cocoon of very loose and vague texture--the “floss silk” of\r\ncommerce, and within that is the cocoon proper, in which the insect lies\r\nenclosed. It will be seen, therefore, that there are really three\r\ncocoons, one within the other, namely, the scaffold cocoon, the floss\r\ncocoon, and the silk cocoon itself, so that the inmate is protected from\r\nvariations of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe cocoon of the emperor-moth, which has already been described, is\r\nmade on the same principle.\r\n\r\nThere are several caterpillars which are social in their early stages,\r\nand which construct a common habitation. The Little Ermine-moth.\r\n(Hyponomeuta padella) affords a familiar example of this structure. The\r\ncaterpillars are great roamers in search of food by day, and travel from\r\nbranch to branch on their strong silken threads. At night, however, they\r\nreturn to a large white silken habitation which they have spun, and\r\nwhich they divide into many compartments, as may easily be seen by\r\ncutting the nest open with very sharp scissors. Within this habitation\r\nthe caterpillars spin their separate cocoons, so that the system of\r\ndouble walls is thoroughly carried out.\r\n\r\nThere is another insect, very common on the Continent, but, happily for\r\nus, not introduced into England. It is called the Processionary Moth,\r\nfrom its curious habit of marching in exact lines, the head of the\r\nsecond caterpillar touching the tail of the first, and so on. These\r\ninsects have likewise a common home, and spin their own separate cocoons\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF PROCESSIONARY MOTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOON OF SILK-WORM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIREPROOF SAFE.]\r\n\r\nThere are two other sociable British Moths which make nests on a similar\r\nprinciple. These are the Gold-tailed Moth (_Porthesia chrysorrhœa_)\r\nand the Brown-tailed Moth (_Porthesia auriflua_). They are both\r\nbeautifully white insects, but may easily be distinguished from each\r\nother, the Gold-tailed Moth having some brown-black spots on the upper\r\nwings, and a tuft of golden-yellow hairs at the end of the body; while\r\nthe Brown-tailed Moth is without spots, and the tail-tuft is brown.\r\n\r\nIn habits they are very similar, and the description of the nest made by\r\none will answer for that made by the other. I believe that broods of\r\nthese two species have been known to construct a common nest. The nest\r\nis extremely variable in form, because it depends much on the number of\r\ntwigs which it includes. Interiorly, it is divided into a considerable\r\nnumber of chambers, each containing one or several individuals.\r\n\r\nAs the caterpillars are hatched late in summer, they have to undergo the\r\nfrosts of winter before they can attain their perfect state.\r\nAccordingly, before the winter-time comes on, they strengthen both the\r\nexternal walls and internal partitions of their nest, and then wait\r\nuntil the spring brings forth the leafage of the new year.\r\n\r\nThe nest is a beautiful structure, and I strongly recommend the reader\r\nto look for one in a hedgerow, take it home, and cut it up carefully. I\r\nwould, however, advise him, if, like myself, he be subjected to a very\r\nsensitive skin, to be cautious in his handling of the nest. The hairs\r\nwith which the pretty black, red, and white caterpillars are studded are\r\nirritant in the extreme.\r\n\r\nI have several times suffered from them, and would much rather be\r\nseverely stung by nettles than undergo the fierce irritation, mixed with\r\ndull heavy pain, which always accompanies the presence of these hairs.\r\nWith me, as I suppose would be the case with persons of similar\r\norganization, these hairs cause large, hard tubercles to rise, just as\r\nif potatoes had been placed under the skin. The hairs of the\r\nProcessionary Caterpillar have a similar effect, and in France the\r\nauthorities have several times been obliged to close the public gardens\r\nfor months, so severe was the pain which the caterpillars inflicted on\r\npersons who passed through the spots infested by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUD WALLS.\r\n\r\nThere is a mode of wall-building which is much in vogue in some parts of\r\nEngland, and has much to commend itself. This is the Mud or Concrete\r\nWall.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, the very name of a mud house gives an idea of poverty\r\nand misery, and is apt to be connected with hovels and pigsties. Mud\r\nwalls, however, if properly built, are far warmer and drier than those\r\nof brick, and are even preferred to those of stone, when the latter can\r\nbe easily and cheaply obtained. In Devonshire, for example, where even\r\nthe cattle-sheds, or “linhays” (pronounced _linny_), and the pigsties\r\nare made of the rich red stone of the county, it is a common thing to\r\nsee village houses built of mud. Sometimes the houses are built of stone\r\nto the height of some ten or twelve feet, and the upper parts made of\r\nmud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF TERMITE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUD WALL.]\r\n\r\nIf the builders are in any way fastidious, they make their walls of a\r\nuniform surface by placing two rows of planks on their edges at a\r\ndistance from each other proportionate to the thickness of the wall,\r\npouring the mud between them, and, when it has sufficiently hardened,\r\nshifting the planks. This, however, is not necessary, and detracts much\r\nfrom the picturesque look of a genuine mud wall, especially when it is\r\nof that rich red which characterizes the Devonshire soil. These mud\r\nwalls are locally known by the name of Cob.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE have not to go very far in Nature to find good examples of the\r\nstrength which can be attained by mud walls.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the world where Termites, popularly but wrongly called\r\nWhite Ants, are to be found, the strength and endurance of the mud wall\r\ncan easily be tested. Of gigantic dimensions when compared with the size\r\nof the architect, they not only endure the rain-torrents which wash over\r\nthem, but can sustain the weight of the wild cattle, which are in the\r\nhabit of using them as watch-towers, and this although they are hollow,\r\nand filled with chambers and galleries.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Africa these nests are much utilised. There is an animal\r\ncalled by the Dutch settlers the Aard-vark, which feeds almost wholly\r\non Termites. At night it issues from its burrow, and, being armed with\r\nlarge and powerful claws, tears a great hole in the side, and devours\r\nthe inmates.\r\n\r\nThese deserted nests are sometimes used as ovens, as we have already\r\nseen, a fire having been kindled within them for some time, the meat,\r\nwell enveloped in leaves, being thrust into them, and the opening closed\r\nwith clay. Sometimes they are used as graves, the corpse being placed in\r\nthem, and the hollow filled up with earth, while the wall of the Termite\r\nnest, when pounded and mixed with water, is found to be the most\r\ntenacious clay that can be used for building or flooring huts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORCHES, EAVES, AND WINDOWS.\r\n\r\nWe now come to some of the appendages of a house, namely, the Porch by\r\nwhich the rain is kept from a doorway, the Eaves by which it is kept\r\nfrom the walls, and the Windows which will admit light and air, but will\r\nprevent the entrance of intruders.\r\n\r\nWe first take the Porch, two examples of which are shown in the\r\naccompanying illustration, one being the work of human hands, and the\r\nother that of an insect.\r\n\r\nThe figure on the right hand represents an old-fashioned Porch, such as\r\nis often to be seen attached to old village churches, and which, being\r\nfurnished with seats, serves also as a resting-place for those who are\r\nweary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NESTS OF MYRAPETRA, WITH PORCHES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORCH.]\r\n\r\nThe figure on the left hand of the illustration is a wonderful example\r\nof the Porch, as constructed by insects. It is the nest of a\r\nhoney-making Brazilian wasp named _Myrapetra scutellaris_. The\r\npeculiarity of this nest consists in its exterior being covered with a\r\nvast number of projections made of the same material as the walls of the\r\nnest, but more solid and much harder. The colour of the nest is blackish\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThe object of all these projections has not been ascertained, but there\r\nis no difficulty as regards some of them. Without a very careful\r\nexamination, it is exceedingly difficult to see any opening by which the\r\ninhabitants of the nest can go in and out. It will be found, however,\r\nthat there are many entrances, which are set in a row round the nest,\r\neach opening being situated under a projection, which thus performs the\r\noffice of a porch as well as that of concealment.\r\n\r\nAnother hymenopterous insect carries out the principle of the Porch in\r\nits nest. This is the _Myrmica Kirbyi_, a tiny reddish Ant which\r\ninhabits India. It makes its nest of cow-dung, which it works up into a\r\ntexture very like that of an ordinary wasp-nest. A series of large\r\nflakes of this substance overhang the entrances, so that the inhabitants\r\ncan enter freely, while rain is kept out. For the purpose of greater\r\nsecurity, one very large flake covers the roof in umbrella fashion. The\r\nwhole nest is globular, and about eight inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT we come to the projecting Eaves, like those of our houses, and\r\nserving to preserve the body of the edifice itself from wet. On the\r\nright hand of the illustration there is an example of the eaves as they\r\nare still to be seen in some of our country places, where the less\r\npicturesque slates have not yet superseded the old thatch. In some\r\nplaces these eaves extend considerably beyond the walls, and I know of\r\nseveral instances, especially in North Devon, where a supplementary set\r\nof eaves extends, like a penthouse, throughout the length of the\r\nbuilding, and just above the windows of the ground-floor.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remark that the projections upon the Myrapetra’s nest\r\nmay very well fulfil the office of eaves as that of porches, and not\r\nonly shelter the entrances, but serve to shoot the wet off the walls of\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration are several instances of eaves as\r\nexisting in Nature.\r\n\r\nIn the centre is the compound nest of the Sociable Weaver-bird of\r\nSouthern Africa (_Philetœrus socius_).\r\n\r\nThis is a dwelling constructed very much after the fashion adopted by\r\nmany hymenopterous insects, namely, that each pair of birds make their\r\nown individual nest, but unite with their companions in constructing a\r\ncommon roof or covering. More than three hundred nests have been found\r\nin a single habitation, and sometimes the birds miscalculate, or rather,\r\ndo not calculate the resisting power of the branches, and, when the\r\nrainy season comes, the additional weight of water brings down the whole\r\nedifice with a great crash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DWELLING OF SOCIABLE WEAVER-BIRD, WITH THATCH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THATCHED EGGS OF GOLD-TAILED MOTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THATCHED HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe thatch which covers this congeries of nests is made of the\r\nBooschmannees-grass, whose long leaves and tough wiry stems are\r\nadmirably adapted for throwing off water, even though they be not bound\r\ntogether like our more regularly constructed thatch.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may be aware that in the Orang-outan, the Chimpansee,\r\nand other large apes, the hairs of the arms are very long, and point in\r\ndifferent directions, so that if the creature should be caught in a\r\nrain-storm, and, after the manner of its kind, fold its arms on its\r\nbreast, with the hands resting on the shoulders, the rain is shot clear\r\nof its body, the hairs performing the duty of eaves.\r\n\r\nBoth Japan and China have a rain-cloak, constructed on exactly the same\r\nprinciple as the thatch of the Sociable Weaver-bird. They are nothing\r\nmore than successive rows of long grass-blades fastened to a network of\r\nthe proper shape. No amount of rain or snow can wet them through, and\r\nthey have the advantage of being pervious to the exhalations of the\r\nbody, though impervious to external moisture.\r\n\r\nIn this respect they are greatly superior to our waterproof coats, for,\r\nif the wearer has to undergo much bodily exertion, or is obliged to wear\r\nit for any length of time, he finds his clothing nearly if not quite as\r\nwet as if he had allowed the pure rain to fall on him from the clouds. I\r\npossess specimens of each kind of cloak.\r\n\r\nWhen I procured them they were quite blackened with London smoke, and,\r\non account of their resistance to water, washing them was a very long\r\nand troublesome business.\r\n\r\nAbove the nest are two patches of the Booschmannees-grass, as they\r\nappear when laid by the bird.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the nest is a group of the eggs of the Gold-tailed Moth, whose\r\nnest has already been described. Perhaps the reader wonders where the\r\neggs are. Owing to the mode in which they are arranged, only a few can\r\nbe seen, and are represented by the little white spots in the lower part\r\nof the figure. When the Gold-tailed Moth is ready for the great business\r\nof laying her eggs, she seeks a suitable place, and then piles them up\r\nin the form of a shallow cone. Her task, however, is not yet finished.\r\nHaving arranged her eggs, she scrapes off the long downy hairs of the\r\ntail-tuft, and arranges them carefully on the eggs so as to cover them\r\nwith a conical thatch, very much resembling that of an ordinary\r\ncorn-rick.\r\n\r\nThe Brown-tailed Moth acts in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nFurs of various kinds act in the same manner, being impervious to wet\r\nduring the life of the animal. Such, for example, is the fur of the\r\nBeaver, that of the Capybara, and that of the Seal, which are animals\r\nliving in our time. These, however, are exceeded in their thatch-like\r\npowers by the three successive coatings of hair that were worn by the\r\nancient Mammoth, the outermost being very long and very coarse, and\r\nhanging down in heavy tufts so as to shoot the water from them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEING on the subject of roofs, we will take a few more examples of the\r\nroof as anticipated in Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINGS OF BUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TILES OF HOUSES.]\r\n\r\nThat parallel fibres, whether animal or vegetable, can throw off rain\r\nwhen properly arranged, has already been shown. Much more is it evident\r\nthat flat or partly flat plates will have the same effect, if they be\r\narranged so that the joints are “broken,” as masons and bricklayers say,\r\n_i.e._ so that the broad part of the upper row of plates overlaps the\r\njunction of two of the plates in the row immediately below it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the right hand of the accompanying illustration are given two\r\nsketches of a modern roof, one slated and the other tiled. The figures\r\non the left show that this formation has been anticipated by Nature, in\r\nthe wonderful system of scales which cover the wings of butterflies and\r\nmoths, and to which all their brilliancy of colour is owing. In spite of\r\ntheir minute size, most being too small to be distinguished by the\r\nunaided eye, they are arranged as regularly as the best workman could\r\nlay the slates or tiles on a roof, and on exactly the same principle.\r\n\r\nThe shapes of these scales vary in almost every species, but they are\r\nalways arranged on the same plan, namely, being placed in successive\r\nrows, each overlapping the other.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, it is almost impossible to wet a butterfly’s wing with\r\nwater. The insect may be plunged beneath the surface, and the long hairs\r\nof the body will be soaked and cling together in a very miserable\r\nfashion. But the water rolls off the wings like rain off a slated roof,\r\nand even if a few drops remain on the surface, they can be shaken off,\r\nand the wing will be perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nMostly these scales are flat, but sometimes they are curved. I have\r\namong my microscopic objects a piece of wing from a South American\r\nbutterfly, the scales of which are oblong and bent, just like the curved\r\ntiles shown in the second right-hand figure of the illustration. These\r\nbeautiful scales are deep azure or warm brown, according to the\r\ndirection of the light.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my readers may call to mind that some architects dislike the\r\nflat, square form in which slates are usually put on roofs, and try to\r\nmake them less formal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHELL OF TORTOISE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEXAGONALLY TILED ROOF.]\r\n\r\nSometimes they take their square slates, and fit them with one of the\r\nangles uppermost, so that each slate looks something like the ace of\r\ndiamonds in a pack of cards. Sometimes they are still more ambitious,\r\nand certainly succeed in producing a better effect, by cutting the\r\nslates in hexagons instead of squares, and fixing them as shown in the\r\nright-hand figure of the illustration. Putting aside the familiar\r\nhexagons of the honeycomb, and the apparent hexagons of an insect’s\r\ncompound eye, we have in the common Tortoise an example of hexagonal\r\nplates that exactly resembles the slate roofing.\r\n\r\nIn the next illustration we have a variety of the same principle\r\nexhibited in differently shaped tiles and scales. The figures on the\r\nright hand show the pointed, the square, and the oblong tiles. These\r\nalso would answer very well as representations of different forms of\r\nscale armour, the one being intended to throw off rain, and the other to\r\nrepel weapons.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the illustration are examples taken from the animal\r\nkingdom. First comes the Bajjerkeit, or Short-tailed Manis, which has\r\nalready been mentioned, and whose imbricated scales will resist the\r\nblows of any spear or sword. As to my own specimen, when it is struck,\r\nit resounds as if it were a solid plate of metal, and I should think\r\nthat during the lifetime of the animal a reasonably strong axe would\r\nnot easily make its way through that coat of mail.\r\n\r\nBelow the Manis are a pair of fish, whose scales, though not so strong\r\nas those of the mammal, yet are arranged in the same manner, and answer\r\nthe same purpose. The last figure represents three scale-bands of the\r\nArmadillo, an animal which has already been mentioned. I may as well\r\nstate here that in several anthropological museums there are various\r\nportions of defensive armour made from the scale-clad skin of the\r\nCrocodile, Manis, and similar animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISHES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANDS OF ARMADILLO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TILES AND SLATES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     THE WINDOW.--GIRDERS, TIES, AND BUTTRESSES.--THE TUNNEL.--THE\r\n     SUSPENSION-BRIDGE.\r\n\r\n     The Window, and its Modifications according to Climate.--Bars and\r\n     Tracery.--The Wheel-window and the Caddis.--Curious Structure of\r\n     the Caddis-tube.--Object of its Window.--The Girder as applied to\r\n     Architecture.--The Radius and Ulna.--The Tie as applied to\r\n     Architecture, and its Value.--Combination of the Tie and\r\n     Girder.--Structure of the Crystal Palace.--Leaf of the Victoria\r\n     Regia.--A Gardener turned Architect.--The Buttress in Art and\r\n     Nature.--The Tunnel used as a Passage of Communication.--Natural\r\n     Tunnel of the Ship-worm.--The Thames Tunnel.--The Piddock, or\r\n     Pholas.--The Driver-ant.--The Suspension-bridge.--The Palm-wine\r\n     Maker and his Bridge.--Suspension-bridges of Borneo and South\r\n     America.--The Creepers and the Monkey Tribes.--The Spider and\r\n     Little Ermine Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINDOW.\r\n\r\nHaving traced, though but superficially, the chief parts of a building,\r\nsuch as the walls, the door which is opened through the walls, and the\r\nroof which shelters them, we naturally come to the Windows by which\r\nlight is admitted to them, and enemies excluded.\r\n\r\nThere are, perhaps, few points in Architecture in which such changes\r\nhave been made as in the Window, which, instead of being a difficulty in\r\nthe way of the architect, is now valued as a means of increasing the\r\nbeauty of the building. Taking for example even such advanced specimens\r\nof Architecture as those furnished by Egypt, Greece, and Rome, we find\r\nthat the Window is either absent altogether, its place being supplied by\r\na hole in the roof, or that, when it is present, it was made quite\r\nsubordinate to the pillars and similar ornaments of the building.\r\n\r\nThis fact is, perhaps, greatly owing to the influence of climate. In the\r\nparts of the world which have been mentioned in connection with this\r\nsubject, light and heat appear to be rather enemies than friends, and\r\nthe object of the architect was to enable the inhabitants of his houses\r\nto avoid rather than to welcome both. Consequently, the Windows were\r\ncomparatively insignificant. They were not needed for the purposes of\r\nlight or air, those being generally furnished by the aperture in the\r\nroof, and consequently were kept out of sight as much as possible.\r\n\r\nBut when architects had to build for a sterner, a colder, and a darker\r\nclime, where the sun never assumed that almost devouring heat and light\r\nwhich in hot countries drive the inhabitants to invent endless devices\r\nfor obtaining coolness and shade, a different style of Architecture\r\nsprang up. In this the Window became nearly the most prominent part of\r\nthe building: the elements were excluded by glass instead of stone, and\r\nthe principal modifications of light were obtained by staining the glass\r\nin various rich colours. Perhaps the Window has attained its culminating\r\npoint in the Crystal Palace, which is all window except its foundations.\r\n\r\nPartly in order to enable the glass to be inserted, and partly to\r\nincrease the beauty of the building, and to avoid the mean appearance of\r\nWindows filled in with plain iron bars crossing each other at right\r\nangles, the interior of the Windows was adorned with stone “tracery,”\r\nvarying much according to the epoch of the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CADDIS GRATING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEEL-WINDOW.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful forms of the Window is that which is called\r\nthe Wheel. The window itself is circular, and the tracery is disposed so\r\nas to bear an exact resemblance to an ornamental wheel, the lines of the\r\ntracery running from the circumference to the centre, just like the\r\nspokes of a wheel. One of these Wheel-windows is shown on the right hand\r\nof the illustration.\r\n\r\nOn the other side is an object, which at a hasty glance might be taken\r\nfor another Window of the same character. It is, however, the work of an\r\ninsect, and not of man, and is magnified in order to show its structure\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAny of my readers who may happen to be entomologists or anglers, or\r\nboth, are familiar with the Caddis-worm of our fresh waters. Most of us\r\nknow that the Caddis is the grub or larva of the Stone-fly\r\n(_Phryganea_), an insect haunting the waterside, and so moth-like in its\r\ngeneral aspect that many persons think that it is really a brown moth.\r\nThe changes or metamorphoses of these insects are well worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the Caddis resembles the larva of the Wax-moth, mentioned\r\non page 151, inasmuch as it has a soft, defenceless body, while the\r\nfirst three segments are comparatively hard. Like the Wax-moth also, the\r\nCaddis lives in a tube constructed by itself. Instead, however, of\r\nhaving a long and fixed tube, up and down which it can pass at pleasure,\r\nthe Caddis makes a tube only a little longer than its body, and light\r\nenough to be carried about, just as the hermit-crab carries its\r\nsupplementary shell. There are many species of Caddis-fly.\r\n\r\nThe Caddis inhabits fresh waters, and cares nothing whether they be\r\nponds or running streams. In order to defend its white, plump, and\r\nhelpless body from the fishes and other enemies, it constructs a tube\r\naround its body, strengthening it by a wonderful variety of material\r\naccording to the locality.\r\n\r\nMostly the tubes are covered with little pieces of stick or grass, or\r\nleaves, while some species use nothing but sand-grains, constructing\r\nwith them a tube very much resembling in shape an elephant’s tusk, and\r\nreminding the conchologist of the dentalium shell. But they seem to use\r\nalmost anything that comes to hand. Taking only examples found by myself\r\nin a single pond, these cases are formed of sand, stones, sticks,\r\ngrass-stems, leaves, shells of small water-snails, mostly the flat\r\nplanorbis, the opercula of the water-snail, empty mussel-shells, a\r\nchrysalis of some moth which had evidently been blown into the water\r\nfrom an overhanging tree, and acorn-cups. The larva, however, does not\r\nseem to be able to fasten together any objects with smooth surfaces, and\r\nthough it has been known, when in captivity, to make its cases out of\r\ngold-dust or broken glass, it could not use either material when in the\r\nform of beads.\r\n\r\nWhen it is full-fed, and about to enter the pupal state, it proceeds to\r\nprepare its habitation. As a larva, when it desired to feed, it\r\nprotruded its head and the front of its body from the mouth of the tube,\r\nand then crawled about in search of nourishment, dragging the tube with\r\nit, and holding it firmly by means of the claspers with which the end of\r\nthe body is furnished. But when it becomes a pupa it is no longer able\r\nto defend itself, and is instinctively compelled to secure its safety in\r\nsome peculiar manner.\r\n\r\nIt cannot fasten up the entrance entirely, because it would not be able\r\nto breathe unless water could pass over its body. Accordingly, it\r\nconstructs a grated window precisely like those of the old castles, so\r\nthat water can pass freely, while no enemy can gain admittance. Unlike,\r\nhowever, the grated windows of the castle, which had no pretence to\r\nbeauty, the Caddis always constructs its barriers in some definite\r\npattern. Each species appears to have its own peculiar pattern, but all\r\nagree in making their window, if we may so call it, exactly like a\r\nwheel-window before the glass is inserted.\r\n\r\nWhen the pupa is about to make its final change into the perfect form,\r\nit cuts away the tracery with a pair of sharp jaws, with which it is\r\nfurnished for this sole purpose, emerges from the water, throws off the\r\npupa-skin, and issues forth as a Stone-fly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRDERS, TIES, AND BUTTRESSES.\r\n\r\nNext in order come the means by which walls are supported internally by\r\nGirders and Ties, and externally by Buttresses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOF late years the Girder, in its many varieties, has come into general\r\nuse, especially in the construction of railway bridges and similar\r\nedifices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RADIUS AND ULNA OF HUMAN ARM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIRDER (FROM A HOUSE IN BERMONDSEY).]\r\n\r\nOn the right of the accompanying illustration is shown the Girder in its\r\nsimplest form. The figure was taken from a Girder which is used in\r\nsupporting the walls of a large building in Bermondsey. Sometimes a\r\ntransverse stay connects the centres of the two curved beams; but it is\r\nseldom needed.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see that if the interval between the curved beams were\r\nto be filled up, we should obtain a form very like that of the engine\r\nbeam described in page 25; while, if we could imagine two such girders\r\nintersecting each other at right angles throughout their length, a\r\nsection of the two would exactly resemble the section of the engine beam\r\nas given in the uppermost figure in page 25.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the human body there are four admirable examples of the natural\r\nGirder, namely, in the bones of the arms and legs.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the illustration are shown the two bones of the\r\nfore-arm, technically named the “radius” and “ulna.” It will be seen\r\nthat these bones are arranged on the principle of the girder. In men who\r\nare especially powerful of grasp, it has been noticed that the curve of\r\nthe radius and ulna has been exceptionally bold, while we have it\r\ndeveloped to the greatest extent in the fore-arm of the Gorilla, an\r\nanimal whose arms are simply gigantic.\r\n\r\nThe two bones of the legs, from the knee to the ankle, are arranged in a\r\nsimilar manner, and are called the “tibia” and “fibula.” The last named\r\nsignifies a brooch, and is given to the bone because it is very slender,\r\nnearly straight, and when in its place bears no small resemblance to the\r\npin of the fibula, or ancient Roman brooch.\r\n\r\nNature, however, has exceeded Art in her girder. Those of man’s\r\nmanufacture can only exert their strength in one direction, and would be\r\nof little use if force were to be applied to them in any other\r\ndirection. Those of the human body, however, have the capability of\r\npartial revolution on each other at their points of junction, thus\r\nenabling the Girder to apportion its strength according to the direction\r\nof the resistance which it has to overcome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to the Ties, _i.e._ those internal beams, whether of metal,\r\nwood, stone, or brick, which prevent walls from falling outwards. There\r\nis no danger of the walls falling inward, but there is very great danger\r\nof their falling outward, especially when the weight or “thrust” of the\r\nroof tends to force them apart.\r\n\r\nIn some buildings, such as an old country church which I attended for\r\nmany years, the architect had openly acknowledged the tendency of the\r\nwalls to fall outward, and had counteracted it by a series of great\r\nbeams extending completely across the nave and aisle. As he had not even\r\ntroubled himself to hide their office, so he did not trouble himself to\r\nconceal the fact that they were tree-trunks, but left them roughly\r\nsquared with the axe, lest, if he had squared them throughout their\r\nlength, he should have diminished their strength.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the partially squared beam is, of course, far more\r\npicturesque than that of a completely squared one. The architect,\r\nhowever, need not have been so careful about strength, for if the beams\r\nhad been only half their diameter they would have been just as\r\neffective. The strain on them is by pulling, and not by pushing. Now, as\r\nany one can see by trying the experiment with a splinter of wood--say a\r\nlucifer-match--an enormous power is required to break it by tearing the\r\nends asunder, while it can be easily broken by pushing them towards each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBut for this power of resistance, we should never have had our Crystal\r\nPalace. That apparently intricate, but really simple (and the more\r\nbeautiful for its simplicity), intersection of beams and lines\r\ndiminishing in the distance to the thickness of spiders’ webs, is\r\nnothing more than a combination of the Girder and Tie, the two together\r\ncombining lightness and strength in a marvellous manner.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Crystal Palace is now so well known that it need not be\r\nrepeated in detail. A vast building was required for the Exhibition of\r\n1851, and not an architect was able to supply a plan which did not\r\nexhibit some defect which would make the building almost useless.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a Mr. Paxton, who was a gardener, and not an architect,\r\nproduced (on a sheet of blotting-paper) a rough plan of a building on a\r\ntotally new principle, and not only fulfilling all the requisite\r\nconditions, but being capable of extension in any direction and to any\r\namount. There have been very few bolder conceptions than that of making\r\niron and glass take the place of brick, stone, and timber, and the\r\nresult fully justified the expectations even of the inventor.\r\n\r\nHow a gardener suddenly developed into an architect remains to be seen;\r\nand, indeed, in this case the architecture was the result of the\r\ngardening, or rather, of practical botany applied to art. Some years\r\nbefore the invention of the Crystal Palace, that magnificent plant, the\r\nVictoria Regia, had been introduced into England. Its enormous leaves,\r\nwith their wonderful power of flotation, caused a great stir at the\r\ntime, and some of my readers may remember a sketch which was engraved in\r\nthe _Illustrated London News_, and which represented a little girl\r\nstanding on one of these leaves as it floated on the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAF OF VICTORIA REGIA (REVERSED).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRYSTAL PALACE.]\r\n\r\nMr. Paxton saw how this power was obtained, and the result was that he\r\ncopied in iron the lines of the vegetable cellular structure which gave\r\nsuch strength to the Victoria Regia leaf, and became more eminent as an\r\narchitect than he had been as a gardener. The capabilities of the\r\nCrystal Palace had lain latent for centuries, but the generalising eye\r\nof genius was needed to detect it. A thousand men might have seen the\r\nVictoria Regia leaf, and not thought very much of it; but the right man\r\ncame at the right time, the most wonderful building in the world sprang\r\nup like the creation of a fairy dream, and the obscure gardener became\r\nSir Joseph Paxton.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that thousands of similar revelations are at present\r\nhidden in Nature, awaiting the eye of their revealer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we come to the principle of the Buttress, _i.e._ giving support to\r\nthe exterior, instead of the interior, and strengthening the walls by\r\npushing them together, instead of pulling them together.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the “flying” buttress, which is simply one buttress\r\nmounted on another to support the clerestory walls, the structure of the\r\nordinary buttress is simple enough.\r\n\r\nThe most primitive form of the buttress is often found in country farms,\r\nwhere the farmer sees the walls of his barns and outhouses leaning\r\nsuspiciously on one side, and, instead of going to the root of things,\r\nprops them up by a stout pole or beam.\r\n\r\nThis, however, can be nothing but a temporary arrangement, especially as\r\nbeams have a tendency to rot, and their ends to sink into the earth by\r\nthe gradual pressure of the wall. The genuine buttress was therefore\r\nevolved, the basal part being very thick and heavy, and the upper part\r\ncomparatively thin and slight. Simple as a buttress looks, much skill is\r\nneeded in making it, and if it be not rightly built, it does infinitely\r\nmore harm than good.\r\n\r\nA case in point occurs within a short distance of my house. The walls of\r\nan ancient edifice having shown symptoms of yielding, and some ominous\r\ncracks made their appearance, a couple of very sturdy buttresses had\r\nbeen erected, in order to stop further damage. Unfortunately, the\r\nbuilder was ignorant of the principles of architecture, and though he\r\nmade the buttresses very strong and massive, he omitted to make a solid\r\nfoundation on which their bases should rest. Consequently he only hung\r\nthe buttresses, so to speak, on the wall, and helped to tear it asunder\r\nby the additional weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PADDLE-WOOD TREE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTRESSES.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATURE, as well as Art, supplies her buttresses. In our own country we\r\nfind the natural buttress more or less developed in our trees, as it is\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, any plantation, and examine the trees. It will be\r\nfound that those in the centre, which are sheltered on all sides from\r\nthe force of the wind, shoot up straight towards the light, have\r\ncomparatively slight and slender stems, and occasionally display such\r\nenergy in forcing themselves upwards, that when two branches find that\r\nthere is not room for both, they form a sort of alliance, fuse\r\nthemselves together, and force their united way towards the sky.\r\n\r\nTake, however, the trees in the outside rows of the plantation, and see\r\nhow they throw out their straight roots and branches towards the\r\noutside, and how, on the inside, their trunks are as smooth and their\r\nroots as little visible as those of the trees that grow in the centre of\r\nthe plantation.\r\n\r\nAlmost any tree will develop itself in this fashion, showing that\r\ninstinct can rule the vegetable as well as the animal world.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a South American tree which far surpasses any of our\r\ntrees in its power of throwing out spurs or buttresses, principally, I\r\npresume, because it may have to endure the fiercest storms from any\r\nquarter and at any time. So bold are these projections that several men\r\nwould be hidden if standing between two of them, and so numerous are\r\nthey that if a section of the tree were taken at the base of the ground,\r\nit would resemble a conventional star or asterisk, *, rather than an\r\nordinary tree-trunk, O.\r\n\r\nThe scientific name of this curious tree is _Aspidomorpha excelsum_.\r\n\r\nThe natural buttresses are so thin and so wide that they look like large\r\nplanks set on end, with one edge against the tree. Indeed, they are used\r\nas planks, nothing more being required than to cut them from the tree.\r\n\r\nThis is very easy, as, while the wood is green, it is so soft that a\r\nblow from a “machete,” or native cutlass, is sufficient to separate it.\r\nWith the same instrument the native makes these flat planks into paddles\r\nfor his canoe, the soft wood yielding readily even to the imperfect edge\r\nof the rude tool. When the wood dries, it becomes very hard, light, and\r\nsingularly elastic, all these properties qualifying it for its object.\r\nI have several of these paddles in my collection. They are much prized\r\nby the natives, and are always stained in various patterns with red and\r\nblack dyes.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the use which is made of this tree, it goes by the\r\npopular name of “paddle-wood.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUNNEL USED AS A PASSAGE.\r\n\r\nAs to this division of the subject, I have not been quite sure where it\r\nshould be placed, but think the present position a tolerably appropriate\r\none.\r\n\r\nWe have already, in the igloo of the Esquimaux and the winter dwelling\r\nof the seal, found examples of the Tunnel when used as an appendage to\r\nthe houses and a means of security. We now come to the Tunnel as\r\naffording the means of locomotion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTUNNEL OF ANOMMA.\r\nPHOLAS.\r\nSHIP-WORM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILWAY TUNNEL.]\r\n\r\nTake, for example, our own railway system. Had it not been for the power\r\nof tunnelling, the railway would have lost nearly its whole value, for\r\nit would have been restricted to local districts, and could not have\r\npenetrated, as it now does, to all parts of the country, without\r\nreference to hill, dale, or level ground. Our present system of\r\nengineering has wonderfully developed the capability of tunnelling. In\r\nformer times it was thought a most wonderful feat to drive a tunnel\r\nunder the Thames, while in these days the tunnel through Mont Cenis has\r\nbeen completed, and we are hoping to make a submarine tunnel from\r\nEngland to France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature we can find many examples of Tunnels used for similar\r\npurposes. The silken tunnel of the Wax-moth larva has already been\r\nmentioned, and we now come to Tunnels where earth in some form, and not\r\nsilk, is the material of which they are constructed.\r\n\r\nThe lowermost figure on the left-hand side of the illustration\r\nrepresents that well-known and most destructive burrower, the Ship-worm\r\n(_Teredo_), which, by the way, in spite of its popular name, is not a\r\nworm, but a mollusc. This creature has a peculiar interest for\r\nengineering, inasmuch as its mode of working gave Brunel the first idea\r\nof subaquatic tunnelling in loose, sandy soil, just as the Victoria\r\nRegia leaf gave to Paxton the idea which afterwards developed into the\r\nCrystal Palace.\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted by the Ship-worm is at the same time simple and\r\neffective. It feeds upon wood, and gradually eats its way through almost\r\nany timber that may be submerged. It does not, however, merely bore its\r\nway through the timber, but lines its burrow with a coating of hard,\r\nshelly material. Taking this hint, Brunel proceeded in the same fashion\r\nto drive his tunnel through the very ungrateful soils which form the bed\r\nof the Thames.\r\n\r\nHe built a “shield,” as he called it, of iron, exactly fitting the\r\ntunnel, and divided into a number of compartments, each of which could\r\nbe pushed forwards independently of the others. In each compartment was\r\na single workman, and, as he excavated the earth in front of him, he\r\npushed forward his portion of the shield, while the interior was cased\r\nwith brickwork, just as a Teredo tunnel is cased with shell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nABOVE the Teredo is represented another marine tunnel-maker, as it\r\nappears in its burrow.\r\n\r\nThis is the mollusc popularly known as the Piddock, and scientifically\r\nas _Pholas dactylus_. It may be found abundantly in all our chalk\r\ncliffs, boring its tunnels deeply into the stone, and aiding the sea in\r\nits slow, but never-ending task of breaking down the cliffs on one\r\nside, while it gradually rears them up on another. As the material into\r\nwhich the Piddock burrows is so hard, there is no need for lining the\r\ntunnel, as is done by the Teredo. In this point, too, our engineers\r\nfollow its example. When their tunnels pass through comparatively soft\r\nground, they line it with masonry, proportioning the thickness of the\r\nlining to the looseness of the soil. But, when they come to solid rock,\r\nthey are content with its strength, and do not trouble themselves about\r\nthe lining.\r\n\r\nThe mode of action adopted by the Pholas has long been a disputed point,\r\nand even now appears to be not quite settled. I think, however, that\r\nWilliam Robertson has proved by his experiments that the shell and the\r\nsiphon are both brought into requisition. The shell perpetually rotates\r\nin one direction, and then back again, just like the action of a\r\nbradawl, and, by the file-like projections on its surface, rasps away\r\nthe chalk, converting it into a fine powder. This powder, being of\r\ncourse mixed with water, passes into the interior of the animal, and is\r\nejected through the siphon.\r\n\r\nThere are many species of Pholas which burrow into various substances,\r\neven in floating cakes of wax and resin. The same species, too, will\r\nburrow into different substances, and it is worthy of notice that those\r\nspecimens which burrow into soft ground attain a much larger size, and\r\ntheir shells are in better preservation, than those which force their\r\nway through hard rock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE uppermost figure represents a very remarkable tunnel, having the\r\npeculiarity of being built instead of sunk. It is the work of an African\r\nAnt belonging to the genus Anomma, and popularly known as the\r\nDriver-ant, because it drives away every living creature which comes\r\nacross its course of march.\r\n\r\nThere are many Ants which seem to rejoice in the full blaze of the\r\ntropical sun, running about with ease on rocks which would scorch and\r\nraise blisters on the hand if laid on it, and finding no difficulty in\r\nobtaining the moisture needful for the mud walls of their habitations.\r\nBut the Driver-ants cannot endure the sun, and, unless compelled by\r\nnecessity, will not march except at night, or at all events during\r\ncloudy days. Should, however, they be absolutely forced to march in the\r\nsunshine, they construct as they go on a slight gallery, which looks\r\nvery much like the lining of a tunnel stripped of the surrounding earth.\r\nIf their path should lead them to thick herbage, sticks, &c., which form\r\na protection from the sun, the Driver-ants do not trouble themselves to\r\nmake a tunnel, but take advantage of the shade, and only resume the\r\ntunnel when they reach the open ground.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when they are on a marauding expedition, they construct a\r\ntunnel in a very curious manner, their own bodies supplying the\r\nmaterials. The reader must know that there are several classes of these\r\ninsects, varying in size from that of a huge earwig to that of the\r\nlittle red ant of our gardens. The largest class seem to care little\r\nabout the sunshine, the protection being mostly needed by the workers.\r\nThe following is Dr. Savage’s account of their proceedings:--\r\n\r\n“In cloudy days, when on their predatory excursions, or migrating, an\r\narch for the protection of the workers is constructed of the bodies of\r\ntheir largest class. Their widely extended jaws, long, slender limbs,\r\nand projecting antennæ, intertwining, form a sort of network that seems\r\nto answer well their object.”\r\n\r\n“Whenever an alarm is given, the arch is instantly broken, and the Ants,\r\njoining others of the same class on the outside of the line, who seem to\r\nbe acting as commanders, guides, and scouts, run about in a furious\r\nmanner in pursuit of the enemy. If the alarm should prove to be without\r\nfoundation, the victory won, or danger passed, the arch is quickly\r\nrenewed, and the main column marches forward as before, in all the order\r\nof an intellectual military discipline.”\r\n\r\nHow they should be able to direct their course, and to chase an enemy,\r\nis not easy to understand; for, as far as is known, they are absolutely\r\nblind, not even an indication of an eye being seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUSPENSION-BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nThe mention of these Ants brings us to another point in architecture. We\r\nhave already seen that they can not only build arched tunnels, but also\r\ncan form their own bodies into arches, and we shall presently see how\r\nthey can form themselves into Suspension-bridges. We will, however,\r\nfirst take the Suspension-bridge, and its vegetable origin, before\r\npassing to the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CREEPERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUSPENSION-BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nI have little if any doubt that the modern Suspension-bridge, with all\r\nits complicated mathematical proportions, was originally suggested by\r\nthe creepers of tropical climates. There are few points in a tropical\r\nforest, no matter in what part of the world, more striking than the\r\nwonderful development of the creeping plants. The trees are very much\r\nlike those of our own forests, and are in no way remarkable, but the\r\ncreeping plants form the chief feature of the woods.\r\n\r\nThey extend themselves to unknown lengths, crawling up to the very\r\nsummit of a lofty tree, hanging down to the very ground, if not caught\r\nby a midway branch, running along the earth, making their way up another\r\ntree, and so on _ad infinitum_. They interlace with each other, forming\r\nalmost impenetrable thickets, as has already been mentioned while\r\ntreating of Nets, and there is scarcely a tree that is not connected\r\nwith its neighbour by means of these wonderful creeping plants.\r\n\r\nOf course the monkey tribes make great use of them in passing from one\r\ntree to another, thus being able to avoid the ground, which is never to\r\na monkey’s liking. Man, therefore, copies the example of the monkey, and\r\nmakes use, either of the creepers themselves, or of ropes stretched from\r\ntree to tree in imitation of them.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world, where palm wine, or “toddy,” is\r\nmanufactured, the native has recourse to an ingenious device which saves\r\na vast amount of exertion. As the calabash which receives the juice of\r\nthe palm-tree is always fixed at a considerable height, and as each tree\r\nonly yields a limited supply, the toddy-maker would be obliged to ascend\r\nand descend a great number of trees before he could collect his supply\r\nof palm-juice.\r\n\r\nIn order to save himself trouble, he has the ingenuity to connect the\r\ntrees with each other by two ropes, the one about six feet above the\r\nother. He then has only to ascend once, and descend once, for he ascends\r\none tree, and by means of the ropes passes from tree to tree without\r\nneeding to descend.\r\n\r\nThe mode of traversing these ropes is simple enough, the lower rope\r\nserving as a bridge, along which the man walks, and the upper rope being\r\nheld by the hands. Those who see these palm-wine makers for the first\r\ntime are always greatly struck. At some little distance the ropes are\r\nquite invisible, and the man appears to be walking through the air\r\nwithout any support whatever.\r\n\r\nIn Borneo the Rattan is continually put in requisition as a bridge. It\r\nruns to almost any length, a hundred feet more or less being of little\r\nconsequence; it is lithe and pliant, and so strong that it can hardly be\r\nbroken. The “canes” formerly so much in vogue among schoolmasters, and\r\nnow so generally repudiated, are all cut from the Rattan. Chiefly by\r\nmeans of this natural rope, the Dyak of Borneo flings his rude\r\nsuspension-bridges across chasms or rivers, and really displays a\r\nwonderful amount of ingenuity in doing so.\r\n\r\nThe one fault of these bridges is their tendency to decay, or perhaps to\r\nbe eaten by the multitudinous wood-eating insects which swarm in that\r\ncountry. However, the materials cost nothing at all, and time scarcely\r\nmore, so that when a bridge breaks down, any man can fit up another at\r\nthe expense of a few hours’ work. As, moreover, the Dyaks have a curious\r\nway of building their houses on one side of a ravine, they find that a\r\nbridge of this kind saves them the trouble of descending and ascending\r\nthe ravine whenever they wish to visit their house.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of America the Suspension-bridge is almost a necessity.\r\nThe country is broken up by vast clefts, technically called “cañons.”\r\nThese cañons are ravines in the rocky ground, with sides almost\r\nperpendicular. For the greater part of the year they are dry, but\r\nsometimes, and without the least warning, they become the beds of\r\nroaring torrents, rising to some thirty or forty feet in height, and\r\ncarrying away everything before them.\r\n\r\nOver these ravines are thrown suspension-bridges made almost entirely of\r\ncreepers, and loosely floored with rough planks. Although they are very\r\nstrong, they appear to be very fragile, and even under the tread of a\r\nhuman being swing and sway about in a manner that always shakes the\r\nnerves of one who is unaccustomed to them. Yet, even the mules of the\r\ncountry can cross them, the animals picking their way with the wonderful\r\nsure-footedness of their kind, and not in the least affected by the\r\nswaying of the bridge.\r\n\r\nPassing from the vegetable to the animal world, we revert to the\r\nDriver-ants, which have already been mentioned. It has been seen that\r\ntheir soldier-ants can, with their own bodies, form a tunnel, under the\r\nshade of which the workers can pass, and we have now to see how they\r\ncan, with the same materials, form a suspension-bridge.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that on their march they come to water, and, as they\r\nalways advance with total disregard of difficulties, they must needs\r\ninvent some very ingenious way of overcoming the difficulty. One of them\r\nclimbs a branch which overhangs the water, clasps the undermost twig\r\nvery tightly, and allows itself to hang from it. Another at once\r\nfollows, and suspends itself from its comrade in like manner, the\r\npowerful and sicklelike jaws doing their duty as well as the legs. A\r\nchain of Ants is thus speedily formed. When the lowermost Ant touches\r\nthe water, it merely spreads all its legs, and awaits the development of\r\nevents. Another runs over it, holds to the first Ant by its hind-legs,\r\nand stands in the water, spreading its limbs as much as possible over\r\nthe surface. Ant after Ant descends, until quite a long chain of the\r\ninsects is formed, and is swept downwards with the stream. By slow\r\ndegrees the chain is lengthened, until the Ants at its head are able to\r\nseize the bank on-the opposite side of the water. When they have\r\nsucceeded in doing so, the bridge is complete, and over that living\r\nbridge will pour a whole army of Driver-ants.\r\n\r\nEven in those cases where this mode of travelling would be too perilous\r\non account of the rapid torrent, the Ants contrive to suspend themselves\r\nin long strings until they effect a communication with the trees of the\r\nopposite bank.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, needless to give more than a passing reference to the\r\nSuspension-bridges made by Spiders, by means of which they can traverse\r\nconsiderable distances. The similar bridge of the Little Ermine\r\nCaterpillar has already been mentioned, when treating of the subject of\r\nDouble Walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     LIGHTHOUSES.--THE DOVETAIL.--THE DAM.--SUBTERRANEAN DWELLINGS.--THE\r\n     PYRAMID.--MORTAR, PAINT, AND VARNISH.\r\n\r\n     The Eddystone Lighthouse: its Position, and the Difficulties of\r\n     building it.--Destruction of successive Lighthouses.--Smeaton’s\r\n     Idea of Form borrowed from the Tree-trunk.--Mode of\r\n     building.--Rooting it into the Rock.--Principle of the\r\n     Dovetail.--Bones of the Human Skull, and their Articulation.--The\r\n     Dam, and its Uses to Man.--The Lock and the Water-mill.--Dam of the\r\n     Beaver: its Objects and Mode of Construction.--Popular Errors with\r\n     regard to the Dam.--Subterranean Dwellings.--The Indian Palace, and\r\n     its Use in Summer.--Subterranean Dwellings in Kamschatka, and their\r\n     Use in Winter.--The Wood or Horse Ant, and its double\r\n     Dwelling.--The upper and lower Nests used according to the Amount\r\n     of Warmth required.--Section of the Nest, and a Glimpse into its\r\n     Interior.--The Pyramid.--Derivation of its Name.--Natural Objects\r\n     from which the Form was derived.--Subaquatic Mortar or Cement, and\r\n     its Use to Man.--Subaquatic Cement used by the Caddis, the\r\n     Stickleback, the Terebella, the Sabella, the Serpula, and\r\n     others.--Paint and Varnish, and their Utility to Man.--Propolis as\r\n     used by the Hive Bee, and the Source whence it is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to some points in Architecture which cannot well be grouped\r\ntogether, and must therefore be treated as Miscellanea.\r\n\r\nOur first example is one which was avowedly based upon an imitation of\r\nNature, namely, the celebrated Eddystone Lighthouse, and we shall see\r\nthat in two points--first its form, and next the mode in which the\r\nstones were fixed together--Nature had been closely followed by the\r\narchitect.\r\n\r\nUnlike ordinary lighthouses, this edifice had to be constructed so as to\r\nendure the full force of waves as well as wind. A few miles from the\r\nsouthern coasts of Devon and Cornwall there is a rock which in former\r\ntimes greatly endangered the ships which passed along the Channel.\r\nSeveral attempts were made to build a lighthouse on this dangerous spot.\r\nWinstanley’s lighthouse, which was finished in 1700, was wholly swept\r\naway three years later, together with the architect himself, and some\r\nworkmen who were engaged in repairs. So terrific is the force of the\r\nelements on this spot, that the lighthouse was entirely destroyed, and\r\nthe only vestiges of it that were ever discovered were some iron bars\r\nand a piece of chain.\r\n\r\nAnother lighthouse was built a few years afterwards, but was burned\r\ndown, it being of wood instead of stone. At last the work was put into\r\nthe hands of Smeaton, who saw that he must build on a totally new plan.\r\nHe took for his model the trunk of a tree, and determined to build his\r\nlighthouse of the same form as the tree-trunk, and to fasten it into the\r\nrock just as a tree is fastened by its roots. Accordingly, he struck out\r\na new principle in the construction of such edifices, and his model has\r\nbeen followed ever since. The reader will see, by a glance at the\r\nillustration, how close is the resemblance in external form. I may\r\nmention that the tree in question was sketched from one in a paddock\r\nopposite my house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREE-TRUNK. EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nHaving settled the form of the lighthouse, and made it like a\r\ntree-trunk, the next business was to fix it firmly in the rock, and, in\r\nfact, to give it roots of stone. For this purpose, he made the base of\r\nthe edifice as wide as the rock would allow, so as to correspond with\r\nthe wide base of a tree-trunk, and traced a circle of about ninety feet\r\nin circumference. Instead, however, of merely laying the stones as is\r\nusually done, or even letting them into holes cut in the rock, he hit\r\nupon a singularly ingenious device, whereby the building was practically\r\na single stone.\r\n\r\nInstead of cutting the stones square or oblong, as is usually done, he\r\nhad them made so as to “dovetail” into each other, much after the\r\nfashion of a child’s puzzle toy, or the junctions at the edge of a box.\r\nThus, each stone fitted into those around it, while the lowest tier was\r\ndovetailed in similar fashion into the rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUTURES OF SKULL\r\n\r\nSECTION OF EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE\r\n\r\nDOVETAILED BOX]\r\n\r\nThe stone employed was that which is called Moorstone, a very hard\r\nvariety of granite. Each course of stones was carefully fitted together\r\non shore, and their accuracy tested, and they were then taken to the\r\nEddystone rock, and fixed in their places. Beside using these\r\nprecautions, Smeaton fixed the stones in their place with the strongest\r\ncement, and furthermore fastened the stones together and united the\r\nseveral courses by strong oak treenails and iron clamps. As none of the\r\nstones weighed less than a ton, and some of them were double that\r\nweight, the strength of such an edifice may be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows the arrangement of these dovetailed\r\nstones in one of the courses. It will be seen that the central stone\r\nmust be laid first, and then the others arranged round it. The whole\r\nedifice is rather more than eighty-five feet in height, so that the\r\nelements have every chance of demolishing it, as they did that of\r\nWinstanley. More than a hundred years have now passed since it was\r\nbuilt, and, although the fury of the tempest has been such that the\r\nwaves have washed completely over its summit, it stands as firmly as it\r\ndid when it was finished in 1760.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHETHER the original inventor of the “dovetail” took his idea from\r\nNature I cannot say, but he certainly might have done so. On the left of\r\nthe illustration is part of a human skull.\r\n\r\nThe skull is not, as many persons seem to think, made of a single bone,\r\nbut it is composed of many bones, united by “sutures,” which are, in\r\nfact, natural dovetails. Although in early life these sutures are\r\ncomparatively loose, they hold the various parts together so firmly,\r\nthat if the head be violently struck, the bones may break, but the\r\nsutures do not give way.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may ask how it is possible to take a skull to\r\npieces without cutting it or fracturing the sutures. It is done in a way\r\nequally simple and ingenious. The skull is filled through the opening\r\nwith dried peas, and then sunk under water. The peas expand with the\r\nmoisture, and, as they exert an equable force in all directions, they\r\nslowly and quietly pull the sutures asunder, without injuring the bones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAM.\r\n\r\nIn many human operations, where a certain depth of water is required in\r\na running stream, the reasoning powers of man have enabled him to attain\r\nhis object by building a dam, or obstacle across the stream, which\r\nforces the water to rise to its level before it can find a passage.\r\nSuch, for example, are the Locks which render rivers navigable, and\r\nallow even the heavily laden barges to traverse miles of water which\r\nwould otherwise have been closed to them.\r\n\r\nThose mills, again, which are worked by water need that a sufficient\r\namount of water should be ready in order that it may by its weight force\r\nthe wheel round. Such a Dam is shown on the right hand of the\r\nillustration, the height to which it raises the water being shown by the\r\nlevel of the stream below the Dam, and that of the water as it tumbles\r\nover in a miniature cascade.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the natural dams made by accumulations of the various\r\ndebris that are washed down by a swollen stream, and which sometimes\r\nraise the water to a very great height, we have an example of a natural\r\ndam in the curious structure made by the Beaver, for the same purpose as\r\nthat of the lock in the mill-stream, namely, to insure a depth of water\r\nsufficient for the needs of the beings that make them.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the Beaver’s dam, but there is so much\r\nmisconception on the subject, that a few words will not be out of place.\r\n\r\nIngenious as is the animal in the construction of its dam, it is not\r\nnearly so accomplished an architect as was once supposed. We were told\r\nin the earlier books of Natural History that the Beaver felled trees,\r\ncut off their branches into convenient lengths, and sharpened one end,\r\nlike an ordinary stake. Then they were said to drive the sharp end of\r\nthe stakes into the bed of the river, to set them side by side, to\r\ninterweave smaller branches among them, and lastly, to fill up the\r\ninterstices with mud, leaves, and similar materials. In fact, they were\r\nsupposed to build a “wattle-and-daub” wall, like that which is in use at\r\nthe present day in Southern Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAM MADE BY BEAVER. DAM MADE BY MAN.]\r\n\r\nThe Beaver does nothing of the kind. It needs a dam, and it makes one\r\nwhich is far stronger than the wattle-and-daub could be. It begins by\r\nfelling a tree, and letting it lie across the stream, in some place\r\nwhere the banks are high and tolerably steep. A bend of the river is\r\nusually chosen for the new dam. Should not the tree be long enough for\r\nthe Beaver’s purpose, two trees are felled, one on either side, so that\r\ntheir branches meet in the middle.\r\n\r\nThese branches, and not any supposed stakes, are really the upright\r\nsupports of the dam. The trees being thus laid, the Beaver cuts down\r\nbranches from four to six feet in length, and lays them horizontally\r\namong the boughs of the fallen trees. Having thus made the foundations,\r\nso to speak, of its dam, the Beaver then proceeds to fill in the spaces\r\nwith roots, grass-tufts, leaves, mud, and, indeed, almost anything on\r\nwhich it can lay its paws.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the Beaver has to take but little trouble, for the stream\r\nitself becomes a silent, slow, but constant labourer, lodging floating\r\ndebris against the dam, and making a sloping bank which much adds to its\r\nstrength. By degrees, seeds that lodge on the dam spring into life, and\r\ntheir roots act like chains, binding the materials more closely\r\ntogether. Willow twigs too, if they lodge on the dam and be left\r\nundisturbed, are sure to “strike,” as the gardeners say, and further to\r\nbind the structure together.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from this short description, that the lower part of the\r\ndam is more solid than the upper. In fact, the floods are tolerably sure\r\nto wash away some eight or ten inches of the upper part every year, and\r\nthe Beavers have to make it afresh. The height of these dams is not\r\nnearly so great as is generally supposed. Mr. Green, a practical\r\ntrapper, states that the highest which he ever saw was only four feet\r\nsix inches in height, and that the average is under three feet.\r\n\r\nThe house of the Beaver is made on the same principle as the dams. Every\r\none knows that when sticks have been in the water for any length of\r\ntime, they become saturated and sink. These sticks are chosen by the\r\nBeaver as the material for its house, and are laid horizontally in the\r\nwater, the heaviest being reserved for the roof, so as to make it strong\r\nenough to ward off the attacks of predacious animals. As with the dam,\r\nmud, leaves, &c., are used to consolidate the edifice, but no mud can be\r\nseen from the outside, the animal always finishing off with a number of\r\nheavy logs laid on the roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBTERRANEAN DWELLINGS.\r\n\r\nI do not intend in this place to take up the whole subject of\r\nSubterranean Dwellings, but only to point out cases where the use of the\r\nSubterranean Dwelling depends on the climate of the locality and the\r\ntime of year, it being sometimes used and sometimes neglected, sometimes\r\ninhabited for the sake of warmth, and sometimes for that of coolness.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of India there are some most remarkable Subterranean\r\nDwellings. They are more than mere dwellings, and are, in fact,\r\nmagnificent palaces, sunk so deeply in the earth that very little more\r\nthan their roofs appear aboveground. When, however, a visitor descends\r\nthe stairs that lead to the interior of the palace, he finds it\r\nspacious, and with tiers of chambers one below the other, very much like\r\nthe wasp-nest which has already been described. Nussur-ed-deen, the\r\nsecond King of Oude, had several of these palaces, but very seldom\r\nvisited them, he having endeavoured to Europeanise himself as much as\r\npossible, and to cast off his native customs. He used occasionally to\r\nvisit them, but it was only out of etiquette, and he never really lived\r\nin them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUBTERRANEAN ANTS’ NEST. SUBTERRANEAN HOUSE OF\r\nKAMSCHATKA.]\r\n\r\nHowever much he might have rejected the ancient customs, it is evident\r\nthat in this case, at least, he was punishing himself in rejecting these\r\nsummer dwellings, which are always cool, and where, if one set of\r\napartments is too warm, nothing is easier than to descend to the next.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHIS dwelling is made for the sake of coolness in summer. Another\r\nsubterranean dwelling is made for warmth in winter, the non-conducting\r\nproperties of the earth being in both cases brought into play. This is\r\nthe winter dwelling of the inhabitants of Kamschatka.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer-time the Kamschatdales live in comparatively slight\r\nhuts mounted on poles, and having the floor some ten feet from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, however, they live in habitations of a very different\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn order to make these houses, they begin by digging a large hole in the\r\nground, about nine or ten feet in depth. This they line with poles and\r\nsticks, making, in fact, a wall as of a house. A stout conical roof is\r\nthen raised over the hole, and upon the roof earth is thickly strewn and\r\nbeaten down, just as has been mentioned when treating of the ice-house.\r\nThe only access to this strange house is by a circular aperture in the\r\ncentre of the conical roof, serving at once the purpose of a door, a\r\nchimney, and a window. A notched pole answers as a ladder, a low wooden\r\ndais placed against the wall serves as a bed or a chair, for there is no\r\nother, and a few stones placed together act as a fireplace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN looking at both these subterranean dwellings, I could not but be\r\nreminded of a very common insect which has a double dwelling, one moiety\r\nbeing aboveground, and the other moiety below it. This is the common\r\nWood-ant (_Formica rufa_), whose large, leafy hills are so plentiful in\r\nsome of our woods. On account of its size, this species is sometimes\r\ncalled the Horse-ant.\r\n\r\nAt first sight the nest looks something like a small haycock, made\r\nentirely of chopped grass. When examined more nearly, it will be found\r\nto consist mostly of grass-stems, little bits of stick, and leaves.\r\nThose of the fir are in great request, for when they are dry they are\r\nvery light, and their form enables the Ant to interweave them with each\r\nother, so as to form the necessary tunnels and galleries which line the\r\ninterior of the nest. The materials seem most unpromising, but they are\r\nused with wonderful skill, such as no human fingers could equal.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while a number of entrances into the nest are visible.\r\nThey are almost invariably sheltered by projecting leaves, which act as\r\nporches, so that when the nest is viewed from above, they are almost\r\nentirely hidden. Each of these openings runs into one of the main\r\ngalleries of the nest, and from thence issues a perfect labyrinth of\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is only half the nest, for the galleries and tunnels\r\nextend far beneath the surface of the earth, and have sundry enlarged\r\nportions or chambers wherein the immature pupæ may lie during their\r\nperiod of helplessness.\r\n\r\nOwing to the very loose structure of the upper nest, and the tendency of\r\nthe earth to fall into the galleries of the lower nest, it is very\r\ndifficult to obtain a trustworthy view of the interior. Perhaps I may\r\nhere be allowed to extract a passage from my “Insects at Home,” the\r\ndescription of the nest and its interior having been written almost on\r\nthe spot:--\r\n\r\n“I have, however, succeeded in obtaining an excellent view into the\r\ninterior of a Wood-ants’ nest, though it was but a short one.\r\nAccompanied by my friend Mr. H. J. B. Hancock,[B] I was visiting some\r\nremarkably fine Wood-ants’ nests near Bagshot. We took with us a large\r\npiece of plate glass, placed it edgewise on the top of an Ant-hill, and,\r\nstanding one at each side, cut the nest completely in two, leaving the\r\nglass almost wholly buried in it.\r\n\r\n [B] Now Sir Henry J. Burford Hancock, Chief Justice of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n“After the expiration of a few weeks, during which time the ants could\r\nrepair damages, we returned to the spot, and, with a spade, removed one\r\nside of the nest as far as the glass, which then served as a window\r\nthrough which we could look into the nest. It was really a wonderful\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n“The Ant-hill was honeycombed into passages and cells, in all of which\r\nthe inhabitants were hurriedly running about, being alarmed at the\r\nunwonted admission of light into their dwellings. In some of the\r\nchambers the pupæ were treasured, and these chambers were continually\r\nentered by Ants, which picked up the helpless pupæ, and carried them to\r\nother parts of the nest where the unwelcome light had not shown itself.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately this view lasted only a short time. Owing to the partial\r\ndecomposition of the vegetable substances of which the Ants’ nest is\r\nmade, the interior is always hot and always moist. Now, the day on which\r\nwe visited the nest happened to be a cold one, and, in consequence, the\r\nmoisture of the nest was rapidly condensed on the inner surface of the\r\nglass, and in a few minutes completely hid the nest from view, leaving\r\nme only time to make a rapid sketch. Unfortunately some one discovered\r\nthe plate of glass and stole it.\r\n\r\n“Next time that I examine a Wood-ants’ nest, I shall take care to\r\ninsert the glass exactly east and west, and shall open its southern side\r\ntowards noon on a hot sunshiny day, so that the rays of the sun may warm\r\nthe glass and prevent evaporation.”\r\n\r\nMany other creatures make subterranean dwellings, but the Wood-ant is\r\nremarkable for possessing a double dwelling, the two portions\r\ncommunicating with each other, and capable of being used according to\r\nthe degree of heat required.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PYRAMID.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the Eddystone lighthouse was the precursor of\r\nmany similar buildings all, like their predecessor, having their form\r\ncopied, with more or less strictness, from the outlines of a tree-stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATURAL MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTIFICIAL MOUNTAIN, OR PYRAMID.]\r\n\r\nAnother form of building which was intended for endurance, and, indeed,\r\nis the most enduring of all shapes, is the Pyramid.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the simple, yet grand outlines of the Pyramids\r\nof Egypt, whose vast antiquity takes us back to the times of Isaac and\r\nJoseph, and which seem capable of resisting the effects of Time, the\r\nuniversal destroyer, for thousands of years yet to come.\r\n\r\nWe may ask ourselves what was the natural object from which the Pyramid\r\nwas copied. The name itself, which is formed from a Greek word\r\nsignifying fire, shows that a flame was thought to have furnished the\r\nidea of this form of building. I cannot, however, but think that the\r\nflame had little, if anything, to do with it, and that the real model\r\nmay be found in the hills which have been formed by Nature.\r\n\r\nExamples of the Pyramids and the Hills are given in the accompanying\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBAQUATIC MORTAR.--PAINT AND VARNISH.\r\n\r\nHaving now disposed of the chief points in Architecture, we take some of\r\nthe subsidiary details.\r\n\r\nOf late years, when the traffic between different continents has so\r\nlargely extended itself, and when shipping has increased both in the\r\nnumbers and dimensions of the vessels, it is absolutely necessary that\r\nwe should have harbours and docks enlarged and multiplied sufficiently\r\nto meet the calls upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CADDIS. TEREBELLA. SERPULA. SUBMARINE MORTAR.]\r\n\r\nNow, it is comparatively easy to construct a building on shore, for all\r\nthe mortars and cements which are used for the purpose of fastening the\r\nstones together are applied when wet, and incorporate themselves with\r\nthe stones as they dry. But to make a mortar which could be applied\r\nwhile the stones were under water, and would “set” while beneath the\r\nsurface, was a task not easily to be overcome. Yet it has been done so\r\neffectively that at the present day we can build beneath the surface of\r\nthe water as securely, though not as rapidly, as if the stones had been\r\nlaid on dry ground.\r\n\r\nSeveral such mortars are now known, and, as is so often the case with\r\nhuman inventions, have been anticipated in Nature.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the Caddis-worm of the fresh waters can cement\r\ntogether, while under water, the various materials of which its tubular\r\nhouse is formed. The different Sticklebacks perform similar feats, no\r\nmatter whether they inhabit fresh or salt water.\r\n\r\nAll those who take an interest in the productions of the seashore will\r\nhave noticed upon our coasts the flexible tube of the Terebella, with\r\nits curiously fringed ends. This tube, as any one may see at a glance,\r\nis composed of grains of sand and similar materials, fastened strongly\r\ntogether by a kind of cement exuded from the worm, and possessing the\r\nproperty of hardening under water. As on some of our coasts fragments of\r\nshell are used for the tube, the worm goes by the popular name of\r\nShell-binder.\r\n\r\nIf one of these worms be taken out of its tube, placed in a vessel with\r\nsea-water and a quantity of sand, broken shells, and little pebbles, the\r\nmode of building will soon be seen. At the extremity of the head are a\r\nnumber of extremely mobile tentacles, and these are stretched about in\r\nall directions, seizing upon the particles of sand and shell, seeming to\r\nbalance them as if to decide whether they are suitable for the tube, and\r\nthen fixing them one by one with the cement which has already been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the Terebella works only in the evening, but, if it\r\nbe hastily deprived of its tube, it cannot help itself, and is perforce\r\nobliged to work while it can. It is worthy of remark that the Terebella,\r\nalthough, as a rule, it lives in a tube all its life, is capable of\r\nswimming with the usual serpentine motion of marine worms, and, when\r\ntaken out of its tube, rushes about violently, and soon exhausts itself\r\nby its efforts.\r\n\r\nAlong most of our rocky seashores may be seen vast quantities of a sort\r\nof hardened sand, penetrated with small tubes. On a closer examination\r\nthis sand-mass is resolved into a congeries of tubes, matted and twisted\r\ntogether, and each being the habitation of a marine worm called the\r\nSabella. This name is derived from a Latin word signifying sand, and is\r\ngiven to the worm in allusion to the material of which it makes its\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nLike the Terebella, the Sabella uses its tentacles for the purpose of\r\nbuilding the tubes, which are much stiffer than those of the Terebella.\r\nThey are strong enough, indeed, to give the feet a firm hold while\r\ntraversing the rocks, and this, is a matter of no small moment when the\r\ntide is coming in, and the shore has to be regained without loss of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThen we have other marine worms, known as Triquetra and Serpula, which\r\nmake tubes in a somewhat similar manner, but of very fine materials and\r\nvery strong cement, so that the tube is nearly as hard as stone.\r\n\r\nSpace would fail me if I were to enumerate these creatures at greater\r\nlength, but enough has been said to show that man’s invention of\r\nsubaquatic cement has been anticipated in Nature by the inhabitants both\r\nof salt and fresh water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to the subject of Paint and Varnish. Putting aside their use\r\nas a means to increase the beauty of the object to which they are\r\napplied, we will view them in the light of preservatives, and\r\nacknowledge the truth of the old Dutch proverb, that “Paint costs\r\nnothing.” Certainly, when the wood to which it is applied is thoroughly\r\ndry from within, it not only costs nothing, but repays itself over and\r\nover again as a preservative of the wood, and a defence against moisture\r\nfrom without.\r\n\r\nThe instances in which Paint is applied to wood are too numerous to be\r\nmentioned. Perhaps some of my readers may remember the case of the naval\r\ncaptain who, on taking command of his ship, was supplied, according to\r\ncustom, with exactly half the amount of paint required for her. The\r\ninvariable etiquette had been that the captain supplied the remaining\r\nhalf at his own cost. But the officer in question was not at all\r\ndisposed to be “put upon,” and was a thorn in the sides of the “Naval\r\nLords.”\r\n\r\nFinding, by actual measurement, that the paint supplied to him was only\r\nhalf the amount which was really needed for the ship, he sent his\r\nrespectful compliments to the Admiralty, asking whether they wished the\r\nport or the starboard side of the ship to be painted, for that there was\r\nonly enough paint for one half of the ship, and he awaited instructions\r\nas to which side of the vessel it was to be applied. He was impervious\r\nto “minutes,” “directions,” &c., and, as far as I remember, this very\r\nimpracticable man got his way, and was supplied with the requisite\r\namount of paint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONG before man ever invented paint or varnish the Hive Bee had made use\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has kept bees knows how they always fasten the edge of the\r\nhive to the board, and stop up any crevices that may be left open. The\r\nmaterial which they use for this purpose is not wax, but a substance\r\ncalled “propolis.” This term is composed of two Greek words, signifying\r\na suburb, or the outskirts of a town, and is given to this stationary\r\nsubstance in consequence of the use which is made of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEE VARNISHING CELLS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAINTER VARNISHING WOOD.]\r\n\r\nNot only do the bees use it for fastening the hives, but also for\r\nstrengthening their combs. Wax is a very precious material, and the\r\nbeautiful hexagonal structure of the bee-comb is intended for the\r\npurpose of combining the greatest amount of storing space with the least\r\nexpenditure of material. The plates of wax of which the cells are\r\ncomposed are so thin that their edges would break down even under the\r\nfeet of the bees as they passed over it, and accordingly the bees\r\nstrengthen the edges of the cells with propolis, as any one may see by\r\nexamining a piece of bee-comb. The propolis is of a darker colour than\r\nthe wax, and has a peculiar varnish-like appearance.\r\n\r\nThe propolis, as distinguished from wax, is mentioned by Virgil in his\r\nGeorgics:--\r\n\r\n    “Collectumque hæc ipsa ad munera gluten\r\n     Et visco et Phrygiæ servant pice lentius Idæ.”--_Georg._ iv. 40.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the propolis cannot be obtained from the same source\r\nas the wax. The latter is secreted by the bees under little plates or\r\nflaps upon the abdomen, while the propolis is purely a vegetable\r\nexudation. It is obtained from many trees, the principal being the horse\r\nchestnut. All who have handled the buds of this tree are aware that they\r\nare covered with a viscous and very adhesive matter, which serves as a\r\nvarnish or protection to the bud before the leaves are strong enough to\r\nbreak out. This is the material which the bees gather for their\r\npropolis, and at certain times of the year the chestnuts may be seen\r\nswarming with bees, all busily engaged in scraping off the varnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DIGGING-STICK.--SPADE.--SHEARS AND SCISSORS.--CHISEL AND ADZE.--THE\r\nPLANE AND SPOKESHAVE.\r\n\r\n     The Use of Tools a Distinction between Man and Beast.--All Men,\r\n     however savage, use Tools, but none of the lower Animals can do so\r\n     until taught by Man.--Tools needed to break up the Ground.--The\r\n     Digging-stick of savage Life: its Use and its Efficacy in practised\r\n     Hands.--Digging-sticks in Nature.--The Heart-urchin, and its Mode\r\n     of digging in the Sand.--The Spade: its Shapes and Uses.--Natural\r\n     Spades.--Fore-foot of the Mole and Mole-cricket.--The Aard-vark,\r\n     the Ant-eater, and the Mattock.--Shears and Scissors a Sign of\r\n     Civilisation, never being employed by Savages.--Mechanical\r\n     Principle of Scissors, the Inclined Plane, the Lever, and the\r\n     Cutting Edge.--Chinese Shears and the Pruning Scissors.--Use of the\r\n     Inclined Plane.--The Diagonal Knife of the Guillotine.--The Shears\r\n     in Iron-works.--The “Drawing Cut” of Swordsmen.--Jaws of the Turtle\r\n     and Tortoise.--The Snapping Turtle and the Chicken Tortoise.--The\r\n     Locust, the Cockchafer Grub, the Great Green Grasshopper, and the\r\n     Wart-biter.--The Leaf-cutter Bees and their Nests.--The Chisel and\r\n     Adze.--Structure of Rodent Tooth and Chisel.--Use of the hard Plate\r\n     of Enamel or Steel.--Combination of hard and soft Materials.--Teeth\r\n     of Hippopotamus and Hyrax.--Principle of the Adze.--Self-sharpening\r\n     and Self-renewing Tools.--The Plane and Spokeshave.--Principle on\r\n     which they are made.--The Spokeshave and its Uses.--The “Guard”\r\n     Razor.--The Hoop-shaver Bee and its Nest.--Its natural Plane, and\r\n     the Use which is made of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many points of distinction between man and the lower animals,\r\nwe may consider the use of tools as one of the principal lines of\r\ndemarcation. Man stands absolutely alone in this respect. There is no\r\nrace of savages, however degraded they may be, that does not employ\r\ntools of some kind, and there is no beast, however intelligent, that\r\never used a tool except when instructed by man.\r\n\r\nAs to the stories that are told of the larger apes using sticks and\r\nstones by way of weapons, they are absolutely without foundation, no\r\nanimal employing any tool or weapon save those given to them by Nature.\r\nIt is true that a monkey may sometimes be seen to take a stone for the\r\npurpose of cracking nuts which are too strong for its teeth, and to\r\nperform that task with great deftness; but such animals have always been\r\ntaught by man, and had they remained in their own country, not one of\r\nthem would have used a stone, were the nuts ever so hard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPADE.\r\n\r\nWe will begin our notice of tools by taking that which must have been\r\nthe first tool invented by man. One of the principal duties assigned to\r\nman is the culture of the earth, and this he cannot do without tools,\r\nincreasing their number and improving their structure in proportion to\r\nhis own development in agriculture.\r\n\r\nBefore seed can be sown, it is necessary that the earth should be broken\r\nup, and, owing to the structure of the human frame, this task cannot be\r\nfulfilled by man without a tool which will enable him to rival many of\r\nthe lower animals, _i.e._ make use of those digging appliances which\r\nhave been furnished by Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEART-URCHIN. DIGGING-STICK.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the first earth-breaking tool must have been a\r\npointed stick, and we find that in Southern Africa, in parts of Asia,\r\nand in Australia the Digging-stick is still in use for the purpose of\r\nbreaking up the ground. The Australians are wonderful adepts in the use\r\nof the Digging-stick, which is one of the simplest of instruments, being\r\nmerely a stick some two feet in length, pointed at one end, and the\r\npoint hardened in the fire.\r\n\r\nThe mode of using it is by holding it perpendicularly, pecking it into\r\nthe ground, and throwing out the loosened soil with the hands. In this\r\nway they can excavate with such rapidity, that a strong navvy, armed\r\nwith the best spade, would not be able to keep pace with a black man\r\narmed only with his “katta,” or digging-stick.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the Digging-stick is used in exactly the same manner, and is\r\ngenerally made more weighty and effective by having a perforated stone\r\nfastened on the handle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHERE, again, man has been anticipated by Nature, and the savage of\r\nAustralia or Africa digs in exactly the same manner as the common\r\nHeart-urchin of our shores, sometimes called the Hairy Urchin, in\r\nconsequence of the number and fineness of the spines, which look just\r\nlike hairs to the naked eye. The scientific name of this creature is\r\n_Amphidotus cordatus_.\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse, in his “Evenings at the Microscope,” gives so admirable an\r\naccount of the mode of digging employed by the Hairy Urchin that I\r\ncannot do better than employ his own words. After describing the variety\r\nof structure of the different spines with which the shell is so thickly\r\nset, he proceeds as follows:--\r\n\r\n“But what is the need of so much care being bestowed upon the separate\r\nmotion of these thousands of hair-like spines, that each should have a\r\nspecial structure, with special muscles for its individual movement? The\r\nhairs of our head we cannot move individually: why should the\r\nHeart-urchin move his?”\r\n\r\n“Truly, these hairs are the feet with which he moves. The animal\r\ninhabits the sand at the bottom of the sea in our shallow bays, and\r\nburrows in it. By going carefully, with the lens at your eye, over the\r\nshell, you perceive that the spines, though all formed on a common\r\nmodel, differ considerably in the detail of their form. I have shown you\r\nwhat may be considered the average shape, but in some, especially the\r\nfiner ones that clothe the sides, the club is slender and pointed; in\r\nothers, as in those behind the mouth, which are the largest and coarsest\r\nof all, the club is dilated into a long, flat spoon; while in the long,\r\nmuch-bowed spines, which densely crowd upon the back, the form is almost\r\nuniformly taper throughout, and pointed.”\r\n\r\n“The animal sinks into the sand mouth downwards. The hard spoons behind\r\nthe mouth come first into requisition, scooping away the sand, each\r\nacting individually, and throwing it outwards. Observe how beautifully\r\nthey are arranged for this purpose, diverging from the median line,\r\nwith the curve backwards and outwards.\r\n\r\n“Similar is the arrangement of the slender side spines; their curve is\r\nstill more backwards, the tips arching uniformly outwards. They take,\r\nindeed, exactly the curve which the fore-paws of a mole possess,--only\r\nin a retrograde direction, since the Urchin sinks backwards,--which has\r\nbeen shown to be so effective for the excavation of the soil, and the\r\nthrowing of it outwards.\r\n\r\n“Finally, the long spines on the back are suited to reach the sand on\r\neach side, when the creature has descended to its depth, and by their\r\nmotion work it in again, covering and concealing the industrious and\r\neffective miner.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will notice that this mode of digging is exactly like that\r\nwhich is followed by the users of the Digging-stick, the earth being\r\nfirst broken up, and the loosened portions thrown aside. The whole of\r\nthe description of the spines is exceedingly interesting, but, as it\r\ndoes not bear directly on the present subject, I cannot admit it into\r\nthese pages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW comes another development in digging tools.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how effective an instrument a mere piece of stick\r\ncan be in the hands of a skilful workman, and the manner in which it can\r\ntear up a given depth of soil. But, for agricultural purposes, something\r\nmore is needed, and the ground must not only be broken up, but a certain\r\nregularity must be observed, in order to allow space to be accurately\r\nmeasured, and the crop apportioned to the area.\r\n\r\nOut of the Digging-stick, then, the Spade was developed, its chief\r\nadvantage being that it dispensed with the use of the bare hands, and\r\nnot only tore up the ground, but threw out the loosened soil.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that in the preceding description of the\r\nHeart-urchin it was mentioned that many of the spines are shaped at\r\ntheir ends something like spoons, and that their comparatively wide\r\nblades are used in scraping the sand and shovelling it aside. In fact,\r\nthese flattened spines are natural spades, used on the same principle as\r\nthe modern spade of civilisation.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration are shown two forms of spade, the\r\none being the ordinary garden tool, and the other a rather curious\r\nimplement which is in great use among the metal mines of Cornwall. The\r\nuse of the ordinary spade is too familiar to need explanation, and we\r\ncome to the Miner’s spade. This implement is used rather as a shovel\r\nthan as a spade, the peculiar bend near the blade preventing the foot\r\nfrom being used as a means of forcing the instrument into the ground. In\r\nfact, it is not meant for the same office as that which pertains to the\r\nordinary spade, neither can it be handled in the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFOOT OF AARD-VARK.      FOOT OF MOLE-CRICKET.      SPADES.\r\n\r\n                                       FOOT OF MOLE.]\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire there is a kind of spade in general use very much\r\nresembling the mining spade, but having a very long handle without any\r\ncrutch at the end. The natural consequence of this shape is, that the\r\nspade cannot be used in the ordinary way, neither can it penetrate the\r\nearth to any depth. It can “peel” the ground, so to speak, and can cut\r\naway successive layers of soil. But as for digging “two spits deep,” or\r\neven one spit, the spade would be absolutely incapable of such a task,\r\nno matter how strong might be the hands that wield it. As for the foot,\r\nit may be put out of the question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now turn to a few examples of spades in the world of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe lowest figure represents the fore-paw of the Mole, with its\r\npowerful armature of strong and sharp claws, and its broad blade of a\r\npalm. The reader will easily see that in this animal the digging powers\r\nare wonderfully developed. The peculiar form of the fore-foot closely\r\nresembles that of the miner’s spade, while the curvature of the palm\r\nserves, almost without exertion, to throw out the earth which has been\r\nscooped away by the sharp claws.\r\n\r\nTo watch a Mole burrow is really a curious sight, the only drawback\r\nbeing that the animal sinks itself so rapidly beneath the earth that a\r\nlong inspection is impossible. I have kept several moles for the purpose\r\nof watching their habits, and have always been interested in their mode\r\nof burrowing. I can only define it by using the word “scrabbling.” The\r\nanimal scurries and hurries about, seeking for a tolerably soft piece of\r\nground. When it has found one, it travels no further, but scratches away\r\nwith its fore-paws with wonderful power and rapidity, seeming to sink,\r\nas it were, into the earth, rather than to excavate a tunnel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is an insect well known to entomologists, called the Mole-cricket,\r\nbecause its structure and many of its habits are strangely similar to\r\nthose of the animal from which it derives its name. At the upper part of\r\nthe illustration is seen a portion of the fore-foot of the Mole-cricket,\r\nand a better implement of excavation can hardly be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably have noticed that in both these creatures the\r\nspade, if we may so call it, is not a mere flat plate, but is cleft into\r\nseveral points. It thus answers the purpose of a fork as well as a\r\nspade, the several points serving to break up the soil, and the flat\r\npalm to throw the earth aside.\r\n\r\nThis principle is carried out even more fully in the fore-paw of the\r\nAfrican Ant-bear, or Aard-vark (_Orycteropus Capensis_), a figure of\r\nwhich is given in the illustration. This animal is a great excavator,\r\nliving in burrows of such dimensions that the wild boar is in the habit\r\nof making its home in them after they are deserted.\r\n\r\nSomething more, however, than a digging apparatus is needed for the\r\nAnt-bear. This animal feeds almost wholly on the Termites, which it\r\nobtains by tearing down the walls of their dwellings. Now, as these\r\nwonderful buildings are nearly as hard as brick, and, indeed, are\r\ncomposed of the same materials, it is necessary that the claws of the\r\nAnt-bear should be modified so as to be able to break through the walls.\r\nAccordingly, they are much more curved than those of the Mole and the\r\nMole-cricket, and so serve for tearing as well as digging, being struck\r\ninto the wall, and thus pulling it down, just as a labourer breaks down\r\na bank with his mattock.\r\n\r\nIndeed, had we wished to extend these analogies still further, we might\r\neasily have given the claws of the Aard-vark as a prototype of our\r\nEnglish mattock. The same weapons as possessed by the Ant-bear of\r\ntropical America are used in exactly the same manner, but are even\r\nstronger, and extend to such a length that when the animal walks, it\r\ncannot stretch its claws out in front, but is obliged to double them\r\nunder its feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEARS AND SCISSORS.\r\n\r\nThese instruments are sure signs of civilisation, no savage nations\r\nhaving the least idea of them. Even the Kafir and Esquimaux tribes,\r\nwhich are such admirable workers in skin, never use scissors in shaping\r\ntheir garments, but invariably employ knives for that purpose. The\r\nChinese, however, seem to have known scissors from time immemorial, and\r\nto have shaped them almost exactly like our own instruments. I possess\r\none pair of tailor’s shears from China in which there is only one ring,\r\nnamely, that for the thumb. The place of the other ring is taken by an\r\nelongated, slightly curved and moderately pointed rod of steel, which is\r\nused for tracing the pattern on the material preparatory to cutting it.\r\n\r\nSimple as the scissors may seem, they combine several very important\r\nprinciples, namely, the inclined plane, the lever, and the cutting edge.\r\nWere they to be merely two edges moving directly upon each other, their\r\neffect would be comparatively slight; but, owing to the manner in which\r\nthe blades are fixed at one end, they are drawn as it were over the\r\nobject between them, and so divide it with comparative ease. In some\r\ninstruments, such as the pruning scissors, there is only one cutting\r\nblade, the other being used merely as a support for the branch which is\r\nbeing cut.\r\n\r\nA well-known example of a single cutting blade is found in the\r\nguillotine. In the earliest times of this invention an ordinary axe-head\r\nwas suspended above the neck of the criminal. It was found, however,\r\nthat its operation was very uncertain, simply because the blow was a\r\ndirect one, and not oblique. The blade was then set obliquely, as in the\r\npresent machine, and its effect was absolutely certain.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may be swordsmen, and therefore know the\r\npower of the “drawing cut,” by which a great effect may be produced with\r\nvery little apparent exertion. Even in the simple operation of cutting\r\nbread we always use the knife diagonally, though perhaps we may be\r\nignorant of the principle of the inclined plane.\r\n\r\nNext comes the principle of the lever, as exemplified by the handles of\r\nthe scissors. By lengthening these handles, the power of the blades is\r\nenormously increased, as may be seen in the various shears in any great\r\niron-works, which cut through thick iron as if it were butter. Our own\r\ngarden shears for trimming borders show very well the power of the long\r\narms and short blade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the animal world we find many examples of natural shears, one of the\r\nbest of which is afforded by the jaws of the Tortoise or Turtle. Owing\r\nto the manner in which they feed, whether they be vegetarians or\r\ncarnivorous, their jaws are made for cutting, and not for lacerating or\r\nmastication. They have no teeth, but each jaw is furnished with a horny\r\nedge, as sharp as a knife-blade, and very strongly made. With these jaws\r\nthe animal can shred to pieces the objects which it attacks, just as if\r\nit had been furnished with a pair of veritable shears. Any one who has\r\npossessed an ordinary Tortoise must have noticed the havoc which it will\r\noccasionally make in a garden. I had one of these reptiles for some\r\nyears, and was obliged to keep it under restraint, in consequence of the\r\npower of its jaws.\r\n\r\nBeing a Tortoise of discrimination, it took a great fancy to the\r\nstrawberry beds, and invariably picked out the ripest and best-flavoured\r\nfruit. Reversing the usual proverb of making two bites at a cherry, the\r\nTortoise always took two bites at a strawberry, and sometimes three or\r\nfour, according to its size.\r\n\r\nAt last, I was obliged to restrain it by boring a hole in the edge of\r\nits shell, passing one end of a string through it, and fastening the\r\nother to a peg driven into the ground. At first, I tied the string to a\r\nbrick, but the Tortoise was so strong that it dragged the brick about\r\nthe garden, leaving reminiscences of its progress in the channels which\r\nit had cut through all kinds of vegetation with its scissor-like jaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAWS OF TURTLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEARS.]\r\n\r\nThe reader, in comparing the illustration of the Turtle-jaws with that\r\nof the Shears, will see at once how exact is the analogy between the\r\ntwo. The sharp-edged jaws correspond with the blades of the shears, the\r\njoint at the skull corresponds with the pivot of the shears, and the\r\nmuscles which move the jaws, but which could not be shown in the present\r\nillustration, are the prototypes of the handles.\r\n\r\nIn some of these creatures, especially those which are carnivorous, the\r\npower of the jaw is tremendous. One of them, a Snapping Turtle, has been\r\nknown to bite off several fingers of a man’s hand as easily as if they\r\nhad been carrots. Some years ago I kept some Chicken Tortoises alive,\r\nand was much struck with the enormous proportionate power of their jaws.\r\n\r\nThey were quite little creatures, only a few inches in length, but their\r\nappetites were astonishing, and their mode of satisfying their hunger\r\nremarkable. They were always ravenous after meat, and had a curious way\r\nof seizing their food in their mouths, placing one paw on either side of\r\ntheir jaws, and then pushing the meat forcibly away, so as to cut out a\r\nslice as large as their jaws.\r\n\r\nThey were very good-tempered little things, but, small though they were,\r\nI should have been very sorry to have one of them take a bite at my\r\nfinger by mistake.\r\n\r\nKnowing their general characteristics, I took care not to have any\r\nliving creature in the same vessel. But I have heard, from those who\r\nhave had practical experience, that Chicken Tortoises ought to be\r\nbanished from any place wherein fish are kept, especially if they be\r\ngold fish, the Tortoise having a way of coming quietly beneath them,\r\nbiting out a mouthful of their bodies, and then disappearing with its\r\nbooty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBESIDE the Tortoise, there are many creatures which possess natural\r\nshears, such as the Locust, whose ravages are only too notorious. Then,\r\ntaking our own country, we have plenty of examples of insect shears.\r\nSuch is to be found in the jaws of the Cockchafer larva, or “White Grub”\r\nas it is popularly called. It lives underground, and feeds chiefly on\r\nthe roots of herbage, shredding them to pieces with its shear-like jaws.\r\nAnd, as it spends on the average three years in the one task of\r\nperpetual eating, the damage which it does can be easily imagined.\r\n\r\nThere is a very pretty English insect which admirably exemplifies the\r\npower of the natural scissors. This is the Great Green Grasshopper\r\n(_Acrida viridissima_), which is equally voracious in all its stages of\r\nexistence. It is always ready to use these jaws, and I do not recommend\r\nthe reader to allow his finger to get between them, or their points will\r\nprobably meet.\r\n\r\nOne of these insects, indeed (_Decticus griseus_), has derived the name\r\nof Wart-biter from its supposed use in curing warts. All that was\r\nneedful was to catch a Wart-biter, and hold one of the warts to its\r\njaws. It was sure to seize the wart, and bite it smartly, and there was\r\na firm belief that any one thus bitten would be freed from the unsightly\r\nexcrescence. The bite of the shear-like jaws caused much pain at the\r\ntime, and this very pain had in all probability something to do with the\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAN admirable example of the insect jaws used as scissors is to be found\r\nin the well-known Leaf-cutter Bees, insects belonging to the genus\r\nMegachile.\r\n\r\nThey make their nests in burrows, sometimes in wood, and sometimes in\r\nthe ground, and form them in a very singular manner. After fixing upon a\r\nsuitable burrow, the Bee goes off to a tree, generally a rose, and,\r\nusing her jaws just as a tailor uses his shears, cuts off a nearly\r\nsemicircular piece of leaf, flies away with it to her home, and, by dint\r\nof bending, pushing, and pulling it, she forces it to the bottom of the\r\ncell. Successive pieces of leaf follow, until she has made a\r\nthimble-shaped cell, and she then places at its end an egg and a supply\r\nof honey and pollen.\r\n\r\nCell after cell succeeds, each being introduced into its predecessor\r\njust as thimbles are packed. Judging from a specimen in my collection,\r\nthere are about eight layers of leaves to form the walls of the cell,\r\nand the average length of each piece of leaf rather exceeds half an\r\ninch. The entire length of the cell-group is two inches and a half. The\r\nleaf-slices are always cut from the edge, and, in my specimen of the\r\nnest, the serrated outer edges of the leaves are all in one direction.\r\n\r\nShould any of my readers find one of these nests, it will be as well for\r\nthem to dip a needle point into diamond cement, and introduce it under\r\nthe outermost coating of leaves. Otherwise, when the leaves are dry, and\r\nthe insects break their way into the open air, the cells will probably\r\nfall to pieces.\r\n\r\nThese Bees are much more abundant than is usually thought. In\r\nsummer-time it is hardly possible to find a rose-bush on which are not a\r\nnumber of leaves from which pieces of variable size and shape, but\r\nalways with a curved outline, have been cut as with scissors. While\r\ncutting them, the Bee seems to trace out her pattern, as it were, by\r\nusing her feet like one leg of a pair of compasses, and her head as the\r\nother leg. As soon as she has nearly finished the operation, she poises\r\nherself on the wing, to prevent her weight from tearing away the leaf\r\nirregularly, and then, while still on the wing, makes the last few\r\nbites, and severs the leaf entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHISEL AND THE ADZE.\r\n\r\nAlready we have seen how exact is the analogy between the scissors and\r\nthe turtle-jaw. As we are upon the subject of cutting instruments, we\r\nwill continue it, trying to discover some further analogies.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustrations we see three cutting tools made\r\nby human hands--_i.e._ the Chisel, the Stone Adze of Polynesia, and the\r\nSteel Adze of this country. We begin with the Chisel.\r\n\r\nAll those who have even a slight knowledge of anatomy know how curiously\r\nexact is the resemblance of the Chisel of civilised life to the front\r\ntooth of any Rodent animal. The head of the Beaver is here given as an\r\nexample, but the tooth of a mouse, rat, or rabbit, which can easily be\r\nobtained, is quite as good an example. These teeth are made after a very\r\nbeautiful fashion. Their outer surface is covered with a plate of very\r\nhard enamel, while the rest of the tooth is of bony matter, and\r\ncomparatively soft. Consequently, when the tooth is used, the enamel\r\nplate forms a sharp edge, while the rest of it is worn away, thus\r\nkeeping the chisel-like end in its proper form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOOTH AND JAWS OF BEAVER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHISEL.]\r\n\r\nThe power of these teeth may be appreciated by any one who has been\r\nbitten even by so small a rodent as a mouse, the sharp edges meeting in\r\nthe flesh, and causing a very painful wound. When the teeth are large,\r\nas in the Beaver, and the jaws powerful, their force is something\r\nwonderful, tree-trunks of considerable size being cut down quite easily.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may not be aware that the Chisel is\r\nconstructed on exactly the same principle as the tooth of the Rodent\r\nanimal. It is not entirely made of steel, as is generally thought. In\r\nthe first place, a valuable material would be needlessly wasted, and, in\r\nthe next place, the tool would not keep its edge except with infinite\r\nlabour in grinding.\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the Chisel-blade is therefore made of soft iron, a\r\nvery thin plate of steel running along the back. This plate answers the\r\nsame purpose as the enamel in the tooth, while the soft iron takes the\r\nplace of the soft bone. Axe-blades, which are, in fact, formed like two\r\nchisels placed back to back, are made on a similar principle, except\r\nthat the steel plate occupies the centre of the blade, and the soft\r\niron is on either side. Thus the thin plate of steel is easily brought\r\nto an edge, while the soft iron can be ground away without any\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to state that the inventor of this combination of thin\r\nsteel and soft iron had taken his idea from the Rodent tooth, but only\r\nto show that the invention, beautiful, simple, and ingenious as it is,\r\nhas its prototype in Nature. I may here mention that the Plane-iron,\r\nwhich is, in fact, a modified Chisel, is made in exactly the same\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT we come to the Adze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADZE-TEETH OF HIPPOPOTAMUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONE ADZE OF POLYNESIA. STEEL ADZE.]\r\n\r\nIn some respects there is much resemblance between the blade of the Adze\r\nand the teeth of the Rodent, especially in their curve, which is almost\r\nidentical in both. This form is seen in the structure of other teeth\r\nthan those of Rodents. There is, for example, the tooth of the\r\nHippopotamus, which is not only curved, like that of the Rodent, but\r\nbevelled off in a similar way at the tip. With these formidable teeth,\r\none of which is now before me, the Hippopotamus makes terrible havoc\r\namong the herbage, mowing it down, so to speak, and stowing it away\r\nwholesale in its enormous stomach. A Hippopotamus indeed, when angered,\r\nhas been known to sever a man’s body completely in two with a single\r\nbite, so trenchant are the teeth, and so powerful the jaws.\r\n\r\nThen there is a little animal called the Hyrax, or Rock-rabbit, which is\r\nthe coney of Scripture. This creature is really one of the\r\npachydermatous group, although its small size, hairy coat, its activity\r\namong the rocks, and its apparently rodent teeth, have induced many\r\npersons to place it among that group. These teeth, however, like those\r\nof the Hippopotamus, are bevelled off at their tips, and, as they\r\nperform a similar office, they take a similar curve.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that in the Stone Adze the bevelled edge much\r\nmore resembles the rodent tooth than does the Steel Adze, the reason\r\nbeing evidently that stone is more fragile than steel, and requires\r\ngreater thickness. Still, the principle is the same in both, only the\r\nmetal is more attenuated than the stone.\r\n\r\nThe Rodent or Hippopotamus tooth has still a great advantage over any\r\nchisel or adze made by man, whether of stone or metal. As our tools are\r\nblunted, we are forced to spend much time in sharpening them, and by\r\ndegrees grind the tool away until it becomes useless. Now, the teeth are\r\nso arranged that their perpetual use, instead of blunting, only sharpens\r\nthem, and in proportion as they are worn away in front they are supplied\r\nwith fresh matter from behind, and perpetually pushed forwards, so that\r\nthey are self-renewing as well as self-sharpening.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANE AND SPOKESHAVE.\r\n\r\nI have already made mention of the Plane in connection with the Chisel,\r\nand shown that, like that tool, it is formed on the same principle as\r\nthe Rodent tooth.\r\n\r\nThe use of this important instrument in carpentering cannot be\r\noverrated, as is shown by the numberless varieties which are used by\r\ncarpenters, and the different uses to which they are put, sometimes\r\nmerely smoothing a level surface, and sometimes forming a “moulding”\r\nwhere ornament is required.\r\n\r\nIn principle, a Plane is a cutting edge or chisel, pushed along the\r\nobject to be worked, and, the edge being guarded, taking off a very thin\r\nshaving from the surface.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the accompanying illustration is shown the Plane in\r\naction, with the thin shavings falling from it in curled masses. Perhaps\r\nsome of my readers may have visited some of the great iron-works, and\r\nbeen struck with the use of the Plane as applied to metal instead of\r\nwood, long iron shavings being taken off as easily as if they were\r\ndeal, and curling in just the same manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is an instrument very familiar to carpenters, called the\r\nSpokeshave, on account of its use in trimming the spokes of wheels.\r\nDifferent as it may be in appearance, it is identical in principle with\r\nthe plane, having an edge guarded by a piece of wood, so that the blade\r\ncannot cut too deeply into the object on which it is employed. The chief\r\ndistinction, indeed, is, that the workman, instead of pushing the blade\r\nfrom him, draws it to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOOP-SHAVER BEE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANE. SPOKESHAVE.]\r\n\r\nWhen shaving was more in fashion than it is in these more sensible days,\r\nthere were many inventions to lessen the trouble, not to say the perils,\r\nof shaving. To use the razor in a hurry was anything but an agreeable\r\noccupation, especially if the weather were frosty, and the fingers so\r\nchilled that they hardly knew whether or not they had the razor between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn order to render this very unpleasant task less disagreeable, some\r\ningenious individual invented the Guard Razor. The principal part of the\r\ninvention consisted in a plate of metal sufficiently thin not to add\r\nmaterially to the weight of the razor, and sufficiently strong to resist\r\na moderate amount of pressure. This was fixed along the blade of the\r\nrazor in such a way that it just allowed the edge to show itself, and,\r\nin fact, converted the razor into a plane or spokeshave. The exact\r\namount of edge which might be shown was regulated by screws, and the\r\nguard itself could be removed at pleasure, so as to allow of the razor\r\nbeing sharpened.\r\n\r\nNow let us see if we can find any examples of the Plane or Spokeshave in\r\nNature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI TRACE at least one example of the Plane in the insect world. More than\r\na hundred years ago, that very observant naturalist, Gilbert White,\r\nnoticed a bee performing a curious task. She was running up the stem of\r\nthe garden campion, holding her jaws extended, and stripping off the\r\ndown with all the dexterity of a hoop-shaver. She collected a bundle\r\nnearly as large as herself, and then flew away with it. What she did\r\nwith her burden he knew not, but the history of the insect has been told\r\nfully, though briefly, by Mr. F. Smith, in his “Catalogue of British\r\nHymenoptera:”--\r\n\r\n“Although the species belonging to this genus are numerous, and are\r\nfound both in the Old and New World, there is only one found in this\r\ncountry, _Anthidium manicatum_; this is truly a summer bee, not making\r\nits appearance before the latter part of June or beginning of July.\r\n\r\n“This insect, so far as my own observation has enabled me to ascertain,\r\ndoes not construct its own burrow, but makes use of any hole which is\r\nadapted to its purpose. I once detected a bee entering the hole above\r\nthe wheel of the sash-line in a summer-house; but its nests are most\r\ncommonly formed in the holes bored in old willow stumps by _Cossus\r\nligniperda_ (the Goat-moth): formerly they were easily obtained in\r\nBattersea Fields, where the willows abounded.\r\n\r\n“It is probable that when the parent insect has selected one of these\r\nready-formed tunnels, she enlarges the end used as the depository of the\r\nnest, and this is easily effected, as the stumps in question, at the\r\ndepth of a couple of inches, consist of soft decayed wood.\r\n\r\n“The chamber being formed, the bee collects a quantity of down from\r\nwoolly-stemmed plants, with which she forms an outer coating. She then\r\nconstructs a number of cells for the reception of the pollen, or food of\r\nthe larva; they consist of a woolly material, mixed with some glutinous\r\nmatter which resists the moisture of the food they contain, and in\r\nwhich the larva, being full fed, spins a brown silken cocoon. These bees\r\npass the winter in a larva state, and do not appear until midsummer.\r\n\r\n“In one respect, the sexes of this genus differ from most other bees,\r\nthe males being much larger than the females.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will see from this account how exact is the analogy between\r\nthe carpenter’s plane and the jaws of the bee. In consequence of the\r\nsimile employed by Mr. White, the insect has been popularly known by the\r\ntitle of the Hoop-shaver Bee. It is a tolerably common insect, and\r\nabounds in the South of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SAW AND ITS VARIETIES.\r\n\r\n     Cutting Tools and their working.--Structure of the Edge.--The\r\n     Kris.--Edge of a Razor.--The Sword and the Apple.--Australian\r\n     Saw.--Fretwork Saw.--Various Saw-flies.--The Pioneer’s\r\n     Saw.--Cutting Tools of Trichiosoma.--Side Teeth of the Saws.--The\r\n     Cordon Saw, or Band Saw.--Tooth-ribbon of Whelks, Slugs, and other\r\n     Molluscs.--The Dog-whelk, or Purpura.--The Circular\r\n     Saw.--Sawyer-beetles and their Mode of Work.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill keeping to the Cutting Tools and their varieties, we come to the\r\nSaw, _i.e._ the cutting tool set with teeth upon its edge. Now, in plain\r\nfact, there is no cutting instrument that does not more or less partake\r\nof the character of the Saw; for, in the first place, it is absolutely\r\nimpossible for man to grind an edge so fine that, when magnified, it\r\nwill not appear to be deeply notched, and, in the next place, its\r\ncutting powers are greatly due to the notches and teeth, and the\r\ndirection of their points.\r\n\r\nWe will take both these subjects in turn.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the notches, or serrated edge. I have now before me two\r\ninstruments, each the best of their kind, and in both of which the\r\nserrations are essential to efficacy. The first is a Malayan dagger, or\r\n“kris,” and the second is a surgeon’s lancet, made by Ferguson, of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIn the kris the edge is intentionally serrated, having been eaten away\r\nby means of acids until the required effect was produced. The Malayans\r\nknow by experience that such an edge is most deadly in a weapon, and\r\nthat it will cut certain vital parts which a smoother edge might pass\r\nwithout doing any damage.\r\n\r\nNow we will take the lancet, and put it under the microscope, when it\r\nassumes the most curious resemblance to the kris. Its mirror-like\r\nsurface looks as if it had been very roughly treated with a coarse file,\r\nwhile its thin and delicate edge, which is perfectly smooth to the eye,\r\nand which will pass through a piece of stretched wash-leather without\r\nany apparent opposition, becomes as rough and jagged as that of the\r\nMalayan weapon.\r\n\r\nTake even, for example, the common butcher’s knife, which is perpetually\r\nbeing sharpened on the “steel” that hangs at his belt. The reader may\r\nobserve that the butcher does not rub the blade of his knife backwards\r\nand forwards on the steel, as unskilful persons do. Rapid as is the\r\nmovement gained by constant practice, any one may see that the blade is\r\nalways moved in one direction, so as to force the microscopical teeth to\r\npoint one way, and so to act as a saw when the knife is drawn across the\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nThe power of these teeth or notches may be inferred from a well-known\r\nfact. If a razor, no matter how sharp, be pressed upon the human skin\r\nwithout any “draw,” it will indent the skin, but not cut it, while the\r\nslightest drawing movement will cause a deep wound. It is the knowledge\r\nof this fact that enables an expert swordsman to sever an apple placed\r\non the palm of the bare hand, without even scratching the skin. I have\r\nwitnessed this feat, and at once saw that it was due to the absence of\r\nany “draw” to the cut. The apple was laid on the palm of the hand, which\r\nwas opened as widely as possible, so as to flatten it. The sword was\r\nthen brought down on the apple with a sort of chopping movement, so\r\nthat, although it indented the skin, it did not even inflict a scratch.\r\n\r\nBy the use of the “drawing” movement, the same sword severed a gauze\r\nveil laid across it, the two halves floating in opposite directions. By\r\nthe same cut, I have seen some astonishing feats performed with an\r\nIndian sword now in my collection, the objects of attack falling asunder\r\nas if by magic, without any apparent force being used.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHAVING now glanced at the principle of the Saw, we will proceed to some\r\nof its details.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of Saw in existence is that which is in use among the\r\nAustralian natives, and consists of obsidian flakes set along one side\r\nof a stick. It looks a rude and inefficient affair enough, but it can\r\ncut better than might have been thought, as I can testify from\r\nexperiments on such a saw in my collection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAW OF COMMON SAW-FLY (MAGNIFIED). GROOVES CUT BY SAW IN\r\nBARK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND-SAW. TENON SAW. PIONEER’S SAW-SWORD.]\r\n\r\nMany as are the varieties of the Saw, the principle is the same in all,\r\nand the chief distinction lies in the shape and arrangement of the\r\nteeth, according to the work which they have to do. Watch-spring Saws,\r\nfor example, which have to cut metal, have their teeth so slight as to\r\nbe hardly perceptible, and arranged nearly in a line with each other.\r\nThe Fretwork Saws, which have to cut delicate patterns in wood, with the\r\nslightest possible waste of material, are of the same character. Then we\r\nhave the long curved teeth of the Circular Saws, which tear their way\r\nsavagely through great tree-trunks, and fill the air with clouds of\r\nsawdust. There are also the Tenon Saw, with its thin blade and broad\r\nback; the pioneer’s saw for cutting green wood, with its double array of\r\nteeth, so as to make a wide “kerf” in which it shall not be clogged;\r\ntogether with many others that we cannot enumerate here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now examine some Saws as found in Nature.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that some of the best examples of natural saws are\r\nfurnished by those insects which are known to entomologists as\r\nTenthredinidæ, and to the general world as Saw-flies. These insects are\r\nsupplied by Nature with a pair of most remarkable saws, which aid them\r\nin depositing their eggs. Indeed, without these instruments, the whole\r\nrace of Saw-flies would long ago have become extinct.\r\n\r\nThey haunt almost every kind of tree and many plants, and one valuable\r\nplant, the Turnip, is so devastated by them, that whole crops are\r\nsometimes swept away. As, therefore, the knowledge of the life-history\r\nof any insect will tell us whether to protect or destroy it, and the\r\nbest method of adopting either course, we will cast a hasty glance at\r\nsome of our commonest Saw-flies, the instruments which they employ, the\r\nmode in which they use them, and the analogies between them and the saws\r\nmade by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be observed that the use of these saws is to\r\ncut grooves in young bark, these grooves being the depositories of their\r\neggs. It follows, therefore, that as a tolerably wide groove is needed,\r\nthe saw-blade is a tolerably thick one, and the teeth set on the same\r\nprinciple as that which is employed in the saw-sword of the pioneer.\r\nWhen the microscope is applied to the cutting instrument of the Saw-fly,\r\nit reveals the fact that there are two horny saws, which work\r\nalternately in their grooves, and that they are strengthened by a thick\r\nplate of horn on their backs.\r\n\r\nThe system of toothing is very complicated. Not only are the sides as\r\nwell as the edges of the saws toothed, but each tooth is furnished with\r\nsmaller teeth, after the fashion of the shark’s wonderfully effective\r\ncutting apparatus. These subsidiary teeth vary greatly in shape and size\r\naccording to the species, and in some cases each tooth is quite a\r\ncomplicated structure. In _Trichiosoma lucorum_, for example, a bee-like\r\ninsect, very common upon hawthorn, the teeth are extremely beautiful. It\r\nis difficult to describe them without diagrams, but I will try to give\r\nthe reader an idea of them.\r\n\r\nEach tooth is somewhat of a lancet shape, but is not terminated by a\r\nsingle point. At the tip comes the secondary tooth, which is conical and\r\nstands on a footstalk. The cone, however, is not simple, but is made of\r\nsome seven or eight cutting plates, each smaller than its predecessor,\r\nand the last being a sharp conical point. The reader may imagine how\r\neffective such a saw would be in cutting green wood, the toothed sides\r\nand the subsidiary teeth alike preventing the blades from clogging,\r\nwhile the alternate movement of the saws enables them to do double work\r\nin the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. Westwood, who examined these insects very closely, throws out, in\r\nhis “Modern Classification of Insects,” the idea which forms the subject\r\nof this book. Writing of the cutting weapon of the Saw-flies, he remarks\r\nthat “from its admirable construction it cannot be doubted that a\r\ncareful examination of its various modifications might furnish ideas for\r\nimproved mechanical instruments.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse, in his “Evenings at the Microscope,” points out that,\r\nbeautiful and elaborate as these instruments are, they are but the\r\nsheaths of a still finer and more delicate pair of saws. These secondary\r\nsaws have only a few teeth on the edge, and these near the point,\r\nwhereas the sides are furnished with a number of sharp blades, set on\r\ntheir edges, slightly overlapping each other, and directed backwards.\r\nThere is a similar structure on the ovipositor of the Sirex, as we shall\r\nsee when we come to treat of Boring Instruments.\r\n\r\nAlthough the saws are made expressly so that they shall not stick in the\r\nwood, there are many instances known where female Saw-flies have been\r\nfound dead on the branches, their saws still in the last groove which\r\nthey have cut. I am inclined to think that these must be females which\r\nhave deposited all their eggs, and which have died, as do nearly all\r\ninsects under similar circumstances. This opinion is strengthened by\r\nsome observations made by Mr. J. K. Lord on the Cicada, the female of\r\nwhich is furnished with a similar ovipositor:--\r\n\r\n“I was curious to watch the female depositing her eggs.\r\n\r\n“She first clasps the branch on both sides with her legs, and with the\r\nends of the file very carefully slits up the bark. Then, placing the\r\ninstrument longitudinally, she files away until she has obtained\r\nsufficient length and breadth. The _small_ teeth of the files are now\r\nused crosswise of this fissure, until a trench is made in the soft pith.\r\n\r\n“When large enough, slowly down the groove in the centre of the\r\ninstrument glides a small pearly egg, pointed at both ends, and so\r\ntransparent that the little grub within is clearly discernible. Gently\r\nshe lays it within its bed, and then drops a thin gummy material on it,\r\nto secure it from moisture. This finished, she proceeds to deposit\r\nanother, and so on, until a sufficient number are produced to fill the\r\nfissure; then over all she drags the everted bark. It is easy to\r\nperceive where the Cicada has been concealing her brood, by the\r\nelevation on the branch.\r\n\r\n“In this manner she deposits about seven hundred eggs, going from branch\r\nto branch, her marvellous instinct teaching her to select the most\r\nsuitable wood for the purpose. The time occupied in constructing each\r\nnest was from fifteen to twenty minutes. Her earthly mission finished,\r\nshe drops, fainting and exhausted, from the branch, and dies.\r\n\r\n“The male, who is always trilling his refrain, goes on, indifferent, or\r\nunconscious, that the task of his faithful spouse is finished, singing\r\neven, until his time comes--then he too drops beside her. Thus the songs\r\none by one cease,--not only the Cicada’s, but all the forest choir, and\r\ngive place to blasts that sigh in mournful music through the leafless\r\ntrees.”\r\n\r\nThe Sirex and several of the larger Ichneumon-flies are often found dead\r\nin like manner, and I have no doubt from the same cause. An elaborate\r\ndescription of the beautiful double saws of the Cicada is given by Mr.\r\nWestwood in the work already quoted, together with illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIBBON SAW, CORDON OR BAND SAW.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may be acquainted with a saw which has of\r\nlate years come into extensive use--namely, the Ribbon Saw, Cordon Saw,\r\nor Band Saw. This is an endless steel band toothed on one edge, and\r\npassing over two wheels. It has the advantage of being of almost any\r\nbreadth, some being several inches wide, while others are mere narrow\r\nribbons, barely the sixth of an inch wide. The fretwork of pianos and\r\nother articles of furniture is cut almost exclusively by the Cordon Saw.\r\nA thick piece of wood is cut of the requisite shape, and the upper and\r\nunder surfaces planed quite true to each other. The pattern is traced on\r\nthe upper surface, and a very narrow Cordon Saw is then applied to it,\r\ncutting completely through the thick block, and adapting itself to all\r\nthe intricacies of the pattern. The block is then cut into thin slices,\r\nso that a number of pieces of fretwork can be made with comparative\r\nease. To those who have been accustomed to cutting fretwork with the\r\nslow hand-saw, the Cordon Saw is simply fascinating, the slender steel\r\nribbon cutting through the wood with wonderful rapidity and very little\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL as this invention is, it was long ago anticipated in Nature;\r\nand the Cordon Saws, which we shall now see, are armed with teeth many\r\nmore in number, and far more complicated in detail, than those of any\r\nsaw made by the hand of man. I allude to the Tooth-ribbon possessed by\r\nmany of our common molluscs, such as the Limpet, the Whelk, the\r\nPeriwinkle, the Slug, &c. The last mentioned of these creatures\r\npossesses a natural Cordon Saw with nearly twenty-seven thousand teeth,\r\nand scarcely a tooth that is not elaborately cut into secondary teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTION OF TOOTH-RIBBON OF WHELK (HIGHLY MAGNIFIED).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIBBON OR CORDON SAW.]\r\n\r\nAs all these creatures have their teeth differently formed and set,\r\naccording to the species, it will be impossible to describe them\r\nseparately. I will therefore restrict myself to the Tooth-ribbon of the\r\ncommon Whelk, a specimen of which is now before me. When viewed through\r\nthe microscope, it is found to consist of a flat membranous ribbon, on\r\nwhich are set three rows of teeth, those of the outer row being hooked,\r\nand those of the inner one plain.\r\n\r\nThe outer teeth are formed somewhat like the Hebrew letter כ, both of\r\nthe points being very sharp, and the central part being furnished with\r\ntwo secondary teeth. All these teeth overlap each other, so that some\r\ncare in manipulation is required before their form can be made out.\r\n\r\nAlong the centre of the tooth-ribbon run successive rows of small,\r\nlancet-shaped teeth, six in a row, so that altogether there are eight\r\nteeth in each row.\r\n\r\nThe power of this weapon is astonishing. Some of my readers may be aware\r\nthat Whelks are carnivorous beings, and that they swarm upon any dead\r\nanimal which may be found in the sea. Indeed, when we hear of the\r\nmutilations which take place on dead corpses after a shipwreck, and\r\nwhich are generally attributed to fishes, we may make up our minds that\r\nthe real delinquents are the Whelks, together with various crustacea,\r\nand that the principal instrument in effecting such mutilation is the\r\ntooth-ribbon which has just been described.\r\n\r\nThe Whelks feed largely upon other molluscs, in spite of their shells. A\r\nperiwinkle has a peculiarly hard shell, and yet Mr. Rymer Jones saw a\r\nDog-whelk (_Purpura lapillus_) eat a periwinkle in a single afternoon,\r\nfirst boring a hole through its shell with the tooth-ribbon, and then,\r\nby means of the same weapon, licking it, so to speak, out of its shell.\r\n\r\nThe Periwinkle itself has a similar tooth-ribbon, and so have the Limpet\r\nand the pretty Top-shell. These creatures are vegetarians, but they are\r\nfurnished with similarly armed tongues, and use them in the same way.\r\nNothing is easier than to see these tooth-ribbons in use. When sea-water\r\nis kept in glass vessels, a green flocculence is sure to collect upon\r\nthe glass and to render it opaque.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a few Periwinkles and Top-shells are placed in the tank,\r\nthey immediately set to work at this confervoid growth, and by means of\r\nthe tooth-ribbon sweep off the green substance, leaving the glass nearly\r\nclean. This movement can be seen with the naked eye, but with the\r\nassistance of a pocket lens the action of the tooth-ribbon is\r\nbeautifully shown as it issues from its socket, makes its sweeping\r\ncurve, with the tiny teeth glittering like specks of glass, and then is\r\nwithdrawn ready for another sweep.\r\n\r\nShould sea-water and living Periwinkles not be easily obtained, the same\r\nphenomenon may be observed in fresh water, and with the common\r\nPond-snail, which may be caught by thousands in any stream and in most\r\nponds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCULAR SAW.\r\n\r\nIn one sense the Cordon Saw is a Circular Saw, but we now restrict the\r\nname to the tool which has a circular blade, more or less deeply toothed\r\non the edge. The largest and coarsest of these saws are of enormous\r\ndiameter, have teeth several inches in length, and can cut a large\r\ntree-trunk asunder in a wonderfully short time.\r\n\r\nThere is a huge saw of this kind in Chatham Dockyard. It is kept in a\r\nsort of cellar covered with flap doors, where it really has the air of\r\nsome dread monster lying in wait for prey. A tree-trunk is brought for\r\nit to feed upon. The doors slowly open, the saw emerges, revolves so\r\nfast that the eye cannot detect the teeth, seizes on the tree-trunk,\r\ntears its way through with a scream and roar, and then sinks back into\r\nits cellar. I have often watched this saw in action, and have never been\r\nable to get over a kind of feeling that it was alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAWYER-BEETLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIRCULAR SAW.]\r\n\r\nNow, if we suppose the saw to be pierced in the centre, and to have\r\nteeth on the inside instead of the outside, it would be equally\r\nefficacious; and, indeed, we have several tools used for cutting iron\r\nbars or pipes, that are constructed on a similar principle, though the\r\ncutting tooth revolves slowly instead of rapidly, and is urged by a\r\nlever handle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is in Nature a Circular Saw of just such a character, the teeth\r\nhaving their points directed inwards, and not outwards.\r\n\r\nIn tropical America there are several large beetles which, like our\r\nStag-beetle, feed upon the sap of trees, and obtain it by wounding the\r\nyoung branches with their jaws.\r\n\r\nOne or two of them are pointed out as having the power of cutting a\r\nbranch completely off by seizing it in their deeply toothed jaws, and\r\nflying round and round the branch so as to convert themselves into a\r\ncircular saw. The late Mr. Waterton showed me a branch which had fallen\r\non his head, and which was said to have been cut off by the\r\nSawyer-beetle, as the insect is called. He did not actually see the\r\ninsect at work, but he had no doubt that the natives were right who told\r\nhim that it was the work of beetles’ jaws. Certainly the cut looked\r\nexactly as if it had been made in the way described. The branch was\r\nsomewhat thicker than an ordinary walking-stick.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this statement has often been denied, but I have\r\nascertained from personal observers that it is literally true. A loud\r\nnoise is produced by the operation, and, as the female is never seen to\r\nperform it, the general idea is that it is a call to its mate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBORING TOOLS.--STRIKING TOOLS.--GRASPING TOOLS.\r\n\r\n     The Bradawl and the Gimlet defined.--Natural Bradawls.--The\r\n     Ichneumon-flies.--A Pimpla engaged in Boring Operations.--Principle\r\n     of the Wedge.--Resisting Power of Earth.--Pitching Tents in\r\n     Sand.--Hidden Forces of Nature.--The Aloe-leaf and its Growth.--A\r\n     cruel Punishment.--Natural Gimlets.--Ovipositor of the Sirex, and\r\n     its Analogy to a Carpenter’s Gimlet.--The Auger and the\r\n     Gad-fly.--Striking Tools.--The Hammer.--Origin and Development of\r\n     the Tool.--The Axe.--The Woodpecker and the Nuthatch.--The\r\n     Ivory-billed Woodpecker.--Grasping Tools.--Pincers and their\r\n     Modifications.--Sugar-tongs and Coal-tongs.--Natural\r\n     Pincers.--Bivalve Molluscs.--The Clam’s Grip.--The Earwig.--Crab\r\n     and Lobster Claws.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORING TOOLS.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the edged tools which cut, come the pointed tools\r\nby which holes can be bored. We have an abundance of such tools, but\r\nthey can all be reduced to two types, namely, those which, like the\r\nBradawl, are forced between the fibres, and those which, like the\r\nGimlet, cut away the material as they pass through it.\r\n\r\nThey may, again, be shown to be different modifications of a single\r\nprinciple--_i.e._ that of the Wedge or Inclined Plane, which, as has\r\nalready been shown, is identical with that of the screw. The Bradawl is,\r\nin fact, a sharp wedge, which is forced through the fibres, sometimes\r\nbeing merely forced between them, and sometimes cutting them, and thus\r\nforcing aside the severed fibres.\r\n\r\nA natural example of the Bradawl is to be found in various\r\nIchneumon-flies, especially those with very long ovipositors, which are\r\nintended for boring into wood.\r\n\r\nAll the Ichneumons are parasitic, laying their eggs in the larvæ of\r\nother insects, mostly those of moths and butterflies. Generally these\r\nlarvæ exist in the open air, and the Ichneumon-fly has little difficulty\r\nin piercing them. But there are some which live either in wood or\r\nunderground, and, in order to reach their hidden bodies, the Ichneumon\r\nis furnished with an extremely long and sharply pointed ovipositor.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful instrument is not so thick as an ordinary horsehair,\r\nalthough it is composed of three portions, and seems to be utterly\r\ninadequate to the task which it has to perform. Ascertaining by its\r\ninstinct the exact locality of the caterpillar which it desires to\r\npierce, the Ichneumon-fly clings firmly to the tree, bends the body so\r\nas to bring the point of the ovipositor against the wood, and, by moving\r\nthe abdomen backwards and forwards, gradually works the instrument into\r\nthe wood, sometimes piercing it to a considerable depth.\r\n\r\nMr. Westwood once saw an Ichneumon-fly thus boring its way into a dry\r\npost, the wood of which must have been very hard. When she had bored far\r\nenough, she partially withdrew the ovipositor, and then re-plunged it\r\ninto the hole that she had made, as if she were depositing eggs. While\r\nengaged in this operation, she stood very high on her long legs, resting\r\nonly on the extremities of the feet. She belonged to the genus Pimpla.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE principle of the Wedge or Inclined Plane is admirably shown by\r\nobjects which we pass unheeded every day, and yet afford wonderful\r\nexamples of the power of the wedge.\r\n\r\nScarcely any vegetable growth is so plentiful as grass, which has been\r\nused in that sense by the highest of all authorities, “which to-day is,\r\nand to-morrow is cast into the oven.” Grass forces its way\r\neverywhere--not only in cultivated grounds, but in the wildest of lands,\r\nwhere there is scarcely any nurture for it. Even among the habitations\r\nof mankind the grass will have its way, and clothes deserted housetops\r\nwith verdure, and forces itself between the stones that pave neglected\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nPlace side by side some of these stones, together with a very young and\r\ntender Grass-blade, and it will seem to be impossible that so fragile an\r\nobject should be able to exert any influence on the solid stone. Let any\r\none try to push a sharp skewer between the stones, and he will find that\r\nhe has to exert power sufficient to crush a thousand grass-blades. Yet\r\nthese slight and delicate objects will force themselves between the\r\nstones, and sometimes to such an extent as to cover the whole roadway\r\nwith verdure.\r\n\r\nThe force which is employed is simply marvellous, and can only be\r\nappreciated by those who know the resisting power of earth, however dry\r\nand loose it may be. Even sand has so strong a resistance that tents can\r\nbe pitched in the desert without difficulty. Of course the ordinary\r\ntent-peg would be useless, but the desert dwellers can pitch their tents\r\nwith perfect security. They fasten the tent-rope to a branch or piece of\r\nbush, scrape a hole in the sand, put the bush into the hole, cover it up\r\nagain, and it will withstand almost any strain, though it be only\r\ncovered with a few inches of sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRASS-BLADES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEDGE.]\r\n\r\nWhen miners blast rocks with gunpowder, they take advantage of the\r\nresisting power of sand. They bore a suitable hole, place a charge of\r\ngunpowder at the bottom, and then merely pour loose sand into the hole\r\nuntil it is filled. When the powder explodes, the rock or coal is\r\nshattered to pieces, but the sand is not blown out of the hole. This\r\noperation is called “tamping.”\r\n\r\nEvery one, again, knows how firm are gate-posts, and how they resist the\r\nweight, jarring, and leverage of a heavy gate, all because they are sunk\r\na little way into the earth.\r\n\r\nConsidering, therefore, that such fragile things as young grass-blades\r\ncan force their way through the superincumbent weight, we can but be\r\namazed at the aggregate of active force which is in full operation in\r\nevery pasture field and garden lawn.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, not being much of a botanist, every seed that springs\r\nup does so on the wedge principle, though the form of the wedge may be\r\nvaried.\r\n\r\nA terrible example of the force which is exercised by this principle\r\namong the vegetables is shown in some parts of the world where the Aloe\r\nflourishes in a wild state. In our colder clime the Aloe, though it does\r\nlive in the open air, is a slow-growing plant. But, in its own land, it\r\nshoots up with a surprising vigour, and its sharply pointed and\r\nsaw-edged leaves are said to grow to the extent of six inches in a\r\nsingle night.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of this rapid, and, at the same time, powerful growth,\r\nthe natives, when they want to punish a man with more than ordinary\r\nseverity, tie him hand and foot, and bind him to the earth just over a\r\nsprouting aloe plant, and leave him there. In twenty-four hours the man\r\nis nearly certain to be dead, the aloe-leaf having forced itself\r\ncompletely through his body. Or, if he be not actually dead, he lives in\r\nfrightful tortures, which are continually increased by the flinty point\r\nand notches forcing themselves slowly, but surely, through the body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOR an example of the Gimlet we may take the ovipositor of the Sirex, an\r\ninsect which I believe has no popular name. It is coloured much after\r\nthe same manner as the hornet, and is often mistaken for that insect by\r\nthose who are not versed in entomology. And, as its long and straight\r\novipositor is generally taken for a hornet’s sting, the insect assumes a\r\ndouble terror to the ignorant.\r\n\r\nNow, the real fact is, that in its larval stage of existence the Sirex\r\nfeeds upon the wood of the fir-tree--a diet which, to our ideas, is\r\nabout as unsatisfactory as can well be imagined. In order that the young\r\nSirex may be within reach of food, the egg must be introduced deeply\r\ninto the body of the tree, and, for the egg to be so received, a channel\r\nmust be cut for it.\r\n\r\nThis is done by means of the marvellously formed ovipositor. Many\r\nadmirable descriptions have been given of the head of this instrument\r\nand its boring powers, but I am not aware that any one has noticed the\r\nsecondary cutting blades that are set along the shaft of the principal\r\nborer, and which answer exactly the same purpose as the spiral cutting\r\nedge of the gimlet or auger.\r\n\r\nNot being desirous of repeating my own observations in different words,\r\nI transfer to these pages a short account of the ovipositor of the\r\nSirex, as examined by me when writing my work on British Insects,\r\nentitled “Insects at Home,” and published by Messrs. Longmans and Co.:--\r\n\r\n“I very strongly recommend any of my readers who may obtain a female\r\nSirex to disengage the actual borer from its two-bladed sheath, and\r\nexamine it with the aid of a microscope. A half-inch object-glass will\r\ngive quite a sufficient power.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ŒSTRUS. BORING TOOL OF SIREX AND LARVA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRADAWLS.]\r\n\r\n“It is straight, stiff, and elastic, as if made of steel, and, if bent,\r\nwill spring back to its proper form with the elasticity of a Toledo\r\nrapier.\r\n\r\n“But the borer possesses an auxiliary cutting apparatus which places it\r\nfar above the rymer in point of efficacy. Even with an ordinary\r\nmagnifying lens, it is easy to see that the end of the borer is\r\ndeveloped into a sharp head, very much resembling that of a\r\nboarding-pike, and that the outline of the shaft is broken into a series\r\nof notches.\r\n\r\n“The half-inch glass, however, discloses a marvellous example of\r\nmechanical excellence. The head of the borer is then seen to be armed\r\nwith long, sharp teeth, slightly curved inwards, and acting just as does\r\nthe carpenter’s ordinary centrebit.\r\n\r\n“So much for the head of the borer: we will now turn to the shaft.\r\n\r\n“It appears that, in order to make a clean-cut hole for the reception of\r\nthe egg, the shaft of the borer has to finish the task which the head\r\nbegins. Accordingly, it is armed on each of its sides with a series of\r\nhard, sharp-edged ridges, running diagonally across it, and acting\r\nexactly as do the sharp ridges of a coffee-mill.”\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the ovipositor of the Sirex is the natural type of the\r\nimproved gimlet of the present day. Instead, however, of having a\r\nsingle, spiral, sharp-edged groove running along the whole length of the\r\nshaft, it has a series of small, sharp blades, set exactly in the same\r\nline as is taken by the spiral groove, and acting in exactly the same\r\nmanner--i.e. by cutting out successive portions of wood, and, by the\r\ndiagonal position of the blades, throwing out the debris as fast as it\r\nis cut.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that, if any modern tool manufacturer could take as\r\nhis model the saw-like ovipositor of the Tenthredinidæ, and the\r\nauger-like ovipositor of the present insect, he would produce a series\r\nof most valuable implements, possessing powers far beyond those of\r\nordinary tools.\r\n\r\nThese short blades are arranged just like the “studs” on modern shells,\r\nand very much resemble them in shape, though not in material.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE Auger finds also a natural representative in the ovipositor of an\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nThat of the common Gad-fly (_Œstrus bovis_) is most beautifully\r\nconstructed. It is tubular in form, and is of a telescopic nature,\r\nconsisting of four tubes of different sizes, the smaller fitting into\r\nthe larger just as is done with the joints of a common telescope, or\r\nthose of a Japanese fishing-rod.\r\n\r\nThe end of the ovipositor is developed into little projections, some of\r\nwhich are armed with hard, sharp points, which act exactly like the\r\ncutting edge of the auger. This elaborate appliance is necessary on\r\naccount of the thick, tough skin of the ox, which the Gad-fly has to\r\npenetrate before it can deposit its eggs. Perhaps the reader may be\r\naware of the fact that the modern system of cutting channels in stone\r\nwith the diamond point, as was so well exemplified in the Mont Cenis\r\nTunnel, is but an imitation, and an imperfect one, of the method adopted\r\nby the Gad-fly. We shall soon recur to this instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRIKING TOOLS.\r\n\r\nIf we search the records of antiquity as left by races of men that have\r\nfor countless ages vanished from the face of the earth, we shall find\r\nthat in some shape or other the Hammer was a tool in constant use, and\r\nthat in principle, though not in material, there was no difference\r\nbetween the Hammer of the Stone Age and that of a blacksmith of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe development of the instrument can easily be traced, especially as it\r\nis a tool which does not admit of much elaboration.\r\n\r\nThe original hammer was evidently a simple stone, and answered equally\r\nas a tool and a weapon. As, however, man progressed towards\r\ncivilisation, he found that the stone itself was insufficient for his\r\nneeds, and that he required much more force. The most obvious mode of\r\ndoing so was to take a larger stone, but this expedient soon became\r\nvalueless, inasmuch as a large stone was a cumbrous instrument to\r\nhandle, and could not be directed with any certainty or delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the lever was then applied to the stone, which was\r\naffixed to a handle, and thus became elevated into the rank of a\r\ncomparatively civilised tool. Sometimes the stone had a hole bored\r\nthrough it, into which the handle of the hammer was inserted, as is the\r\ncase with most of our present hammers and pickaxes. Sometimes the end of\r\nthe handle was enlarged, and the stone thrust through it, as is now done\r\nwith the axes of Southern Africa. Sometimes a long, flexible rod was\r\nused by way of handle, the centre of it taking two turns round the\r\nstone, and the ends being lashed together. Handles thus made may be seen\r\nin any blacksmith’s forge of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe tool thus made was soon developed into various forms for different\r\nuses. By lengthening and pointing the head, it became a pick for\r\nloosening the earth. By widening and flattening the head, it became a\r\nhatchet; and, by performing the same alteration in the pickaxe blade, it\r\nbecame an adze. I possess a singularly ingenious tool from Borneo, in\r\nwhich the head is movable, so as to be used as a hatchet or adze at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nIn Demmin’s “Weapons of War” many such hammers and axes are figured.\r\nOne of them is very remarkable. It is an ancient war-hammer made of\r\nblack stone, and is shaped exactly like a pickaxe, except that one end\r\nof the head is carved into a semblance of some animal’s head. The handle\r\nis passed through an oval hole in the centre, just like our pickaxes of\r\nthe present day. This remarkable example of the art of the Stone Age was\r\nfound in Russia. The head was nearly a foot in length.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATURE possesses many examples of this principle, of which I have chosen\r\ntwo, namely, the Woodpecker and the Nuthatch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NUTHATCH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODPECKER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMMER.]\r\n\r\nThe wonderful power of beak possessed by both these birds is familiar to\r\nevery one, but it is not so generally known that they do not merely peck\r\nafter the usual fashion among birds, _i.e._ delivering the stroke with\r\nthe force derived from the neck alone. These birds have an additional\r\nleverage. Grasping the tree firmly with their feet, they not only peck,\r\nbut swing their whole bodies with each stroke, bringing their weight to\r\nbear upon the object. They thus convert themselves into living hammers,\r\nthe feet acting the part of the human hand, the body of the bird being\r\nanalogous to the handle of the hammer, and the head playing the same\r\npart in both cases.\r\n\r\nIn England these birds are not known as well as they ought to be, partly\r\nbecause they are both very shy creatures, and partly because the gradual\r\nextinction of forests has deprived them, and especially the Woodpecker,\r\nof their undisturbed homes. Yet those who are early risers may see both\r\nbirds in places where their presence is quite unsuspected, except,\r\nperhaps, by those who can recognise the signs which they have left\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nThere is a common saying to the effect that “a carpenter is known by his\r\nchips,” and the proverb is equally true of the Nuthatch and the\r\nWoodpecker. Nutshells scientifically split asunder, and jammed into the\r\nrough bark of a tree-trunk, betray at once the Nuthatch to the eye of a\r\nnaturalist; while an accumulation of shattered bark, splinters of wood,\r\nand similar debris announces, in equally bold type, that a Woodpecker\r\nhas been at work.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Woodpecker’s beak may be gathered from Wilson’s\r\nwell-known account of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker, which he had wounded\r\nand was trying to rear. While staying at an hotel, he locked the bird in\r\nhis room, and, on returning within an hour, found an astonishing state\r\nof things.\r\n\r\n“He had mounted along the side of the window, nearly as high as the\r\nceiling, a little below which he had begun to break through. The bed was\r\ncovered with large pieces of plaster, the lath was exposed for at least\r\nfifteen inches square, and a hole large enough to admit the fist opened\r\nto the weather boards, so that in less than another hour he would\r\ncertainly have succeeded in making his way through.\r\n\r\n“I now tied a string round his leg, and, fastening it to the table,\r\nagain left him. I wished to preserve his life, and had gone off in\r\nsearch of suitable food for him. As I re-ascended the stairs, I heard\r\nhim again at work, and on entering had the mortification to perceive\r\nthat he had almost ruined the mahogany table to which he was fastened,\r\nand on which he had wreaked his whole vengeance.”\r\n\r\nThe beak of the Woodpecker was employed upon its new master quite as\r\nforcibly as upon walls and furniture, but Wilson was of too generous a\r\nnature to resent his injuries, and lamented sincerely when the bird\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably observe that the Hammer which has been given as\r\nan illustration of this principle is the ordinary geologist’s hammer,\r\nand that it has been selected because its head is so formed that one end\r\ncan be employed for the usual tasks of a hammer, while the other end,\r\nwith its slight curve and sharp point, is, in fact, a sort of pickaxe,\r\nand used for the same purposes. Indeed, this instrument is an almost\r\nexact reproduction of the stone hammer which has already-been mentioned,\r\nthe blunt end being represented by the carved head, and the sharp end by\r\nthe pickaxe point.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASPING TOOLS.\r\n\r\nAlready we have spoken of the Shears and Scissors, together with their\r\nmode of action and dependence upon leverage. We now come to a set of\r\ntools which, although equally dependent on leverage, develop that power\r\nby grasping instead of cutting. Without these tools, the arts and\r\nsciences could have scarcely made themselves felt, as there are but few\r\nmanufactures in which the artificer does not require a grasping power\r\nfar superior to that of the human hand.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the enormous power of the Pincers is never shown to better\r\nadvantage than in the great iron-works, where enormous masses of\r\nwhite-hot metal have to be brought under the blows of the steam hammer.\r\nI do not know of anything which affords a more imposing realisation of\r\nthe Divine command that man is to subdue the earth as well as to\r\nreplenish it. There is the vast hammer, striking blows which are felt\r\nthroughout a large area as if a succession of earthquakes had been let\r\nloose. In the furnace there is an enormous mass of iron, heated to such\r\na degree that an unpractised eye could no more dare to look at it than\r\nto stare a midsummer sun out of face.\r\n\r\nWhere are the armies who are to cope with such forces? A few stalwart\r\nand grimy men come forward, each man with a curious but unmistakable air\r\nof one who wages a war of giants. The furnace door is opened, and out\r\nrushes a blinding light which strikes on the eyeballs like a shock of\r\nelectricity. The men seize the handles of an enormous pair of Pincers,\r\nsuspended in the middle by a chain, and though no unpractised eye can\r\ndistinguish the glowing iron from the enveloping fire, they run the\r\nPincers into the furnace, seize the iron, swing it to the anvil, and\r\nturn it this way and that way as easily as if it were a feather, while\r\nthe blows of the gigantic hammer descend upon it, enveloping them in a\r\ntorrent of sparks which spurt as if they were mere splashes of water,\r\nand seem to do them no more harm.\r\n\r\nTaking the minor exposition of the Pincers principle and their use, we\r\nmay mention the ordinary Pincers which are mostly used for drawing\r\nnails. Then there are the smaller Pincers called Pliers, all of which\r\nare constructed on the same principle, and the chief of which are the\r\nRound-nosed Pliers, the Long-nosed Pliers, and the Gas Pliers. Sometimes\r\na mixture of the Hammer and the Pincers is ingeniously contrived, as in\r\nthe tool which is represented on the right hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSSEL-SHELL. EARWIG. LOBSTER-CLAW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR-TONGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PINCERS.]\r\n\r\nThen we have the still smaller and feebler Pincers of civilised life,\r\nsuch as the Sugar-tongs and the ordinary Coal-tongs of our firesides.\r\nAnatomists could have had no practical existence without the Pincers, of\r\nwhich their beautifully constructed and much-elaborated forceps are but\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nTake, again, the dentist, with his series of shining instruments, which\r\nhe so carefully keeps out of sight until he has got his patient safely\r\nin that awful chair, and which glide, as by a conjurer’s trick, empty\r\ninto an open mouth, and return in a few seconds with a tooth between\r\ntheir polished jaws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALL these instruments have their parallels in Nature, and in many\r\ninstances the natural pincers might supply useful hints to modern\r\ntool-makers.\r\n\r\nIn the left-hand upper corner of the illustration is shown the common\r\nfresh-water Mussel, which is so plentiful in almost all our rivers and\r\nmany of our ponds. Its scientific name is _Unio margaritiferus_. The\r\nlatter title, which signifies “pearl-bearing,” is given to it because\r\nit furnishes the British pearls which were at one time so highly valued.\r\n\r\nLike other bivalve molluscs, this Unio has the two halves of the shell\r\nfitting quite tightly upon each other, and, when they are drawn together\r\nby the contraction of the internal muscles, they can give a very severe\r\npinch. In many uncivilised parts of the world the natives take advantage\r\nof this property, and use them as tweezers, chiefly for the purpose of\r\npulling out hairs which they are pleased to think are not needed.\r\n\r\nI need not state that with all bivalves the power is increased in\r\nproportion to the size of the shell. Even an Oyster can pinch most\r\nseverely, while the Giant Clam, the shell of which weighs some four\r\nhundred pounds, could nearly take off a man’s leg if it seized him.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Keast Lord, in his “Naturalist in British Columbia,” relates an\r\namusing story that was told to him by an old settler respecting the\r\npower of the Clam’s grip:--\r\n\r\n“You see, sir, as I was a-cruising down these flats about sun-up, the\r\ntide jist at the nip, as it is now, I see a whole pile of\r\nshoveller-ducks snabbling in the mud, and busy as dogfish in herring\r\ntime. So I creeps down, and slap I let ’em have it. Six on ’em turned\r\nover, and off went the pack, gallows scared, and quacking like mad.”\r\n\r\n“Down I runs to pick up the dead uns, when I see an old mallard\r\na-playing up all kinds o’ antics, jumping, backing, flapping, but fast\r\nby the head, as if he had his nose in a steel trap; and when I comes up\r\nto him, blest if a large Clam hadn’t hold of him, hard and fast, by the\r\nbeak.”\r\n\r\n“The old mallard might ha’ tried his hardest, but may I never bait a\r\nmartin-trap again if that Clam wouldn’t ha’ held him agin any odds till\r\na tide run in, and then he’d ha’ been a gone shoveller sure as shooting.\r\nSo I cracked up the Clam with the butt of my old gun, and bagged the\r\nmallard.”\r\n\r\nOf course the reader will remember that this was only an ordinary Clam,\r\nand not one of the giant race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the shell are two very perfect instances of natural Pincers, each\r\nacting in a different manner, but on the same principle.\r\n\r\nThe Earwig is too familiar to need much description, but I may as well\r\nstate that its pincers are not primarily intended as weapons, although\r\nthey can be so used on occasion. (I was about to say, at a pinch, but\r\nrefrain.) They resemble our ordinary pincers in that both blades move\r\nequally, and they are so completely under the control of their owner,\r\nthat the insect uses them with a delicacy of touch that a lady’s fingers\r\ncould hardly surpass. They are really tools, and not weapons, and are\r\nemployed for the purpose of folding the wide and delicate wings under\r\nthe tiny elytra.\r\n\r\nThere is another insect called the Scorpion-fly (_Panorpa_), the male of\r\nwhich is furnished with a pair of pincers at the end of a long and\r\nflexible tail, articulated just like the tail of a scorpion, and moved\r\nin exactly the same manner. It is but a little insect, but its gestures\r\nare so menacing as it flourishes its tail about, that non-entomologists\r\nmay well be pardoned for being afraid of it. Moreover, small as are the\r\npincers, they really can give a smart nip, and make themselves felt on\r\nthe human skin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIF we want examples of exceedingly powerful pincers, we need only go to\r\nthe Lobsters and Crabs, especially to the latter, whose claws are often\r\nof enormous thickness in proportion to the size of the animal. All those\r\nwho have visited the seaside know how severe is the pinch of the common\r\nGreen Crab, comparatively small though it be, and the same may be said\r\nof the river crayfish, which is, in fact, a lobster in miniature.\r\n\r\nAs to the lobster itself, fishermen are so well acquainted with the\r\npower of its claws, that they tie them together with string as soon as\r\nthe animal is caught. Formerly they used to “peg” them, _i.e._ drive a\r\nwooden peg into the joint so as to prevent it from moving. This custom,\r\nhowever, is now prohibited by law on account of its cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Crab’s claws is so great that a bite from a large Crab\r\nwill inflict a severe injury, and render a hand helpless. It has more\r\nthan once happened that men who have been feeling for Crabs in the\r\nrecesses of the rocks at low water have been seized, and seriously\r\nimperilled, not being able to release themselves from the gripe.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is said that there have been instances where the Crab has\r\nheld so tightly, that the man has been drowned by the returning tide, no\r\none having come to his assistance. I am, however, inclined to doubt this\r\nstatement, thinking that the Crab would not be likely to remain in its\r\nhiding-place very long after the water came up. Still, that such an idea\r\nshould be currently believed in many parts of England shows the\r\nestimation in which the gripe of the Crab’s claw is held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPOLISHING TOOLS.--MEASURING TOOLS.\r\n\r\n     Files and Sand-papers.--The Sheffield File and its Structure.--The\r\n     Equisetum, Mare’s Tail, or Dutch Rush.--Beauty of its Surface when\r\n     seen through the Microscope.--Sand-paper.--Skin of Dog-fish, Skate,\r\n     and Shark.--Skate-skin used for Sword-handles.--Distinction between\r\n     the File and Sand-paper.--Measuring Tools.--The Plumb-rule and the\r\n     Level.--Their Use in Tunnelling.--The Measure and its Uses.--The\r\n     Two-foot Rule and the Tape Measure.--Ovipositor of\r\n     Gall-fly.--Tongues of the Woodpecker, Wryneck, and Creeper.--The\r\n     Spirit-level and its Uses.--Theodolite and Callipers in Nature and\r\n     Art.--The Contouring-glass.--Pincers of Earwig again.--Jaws of\r\n     Insects.--The great Sialis of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILES AND SAND-PAPERS.\r\n\r\nHaving now examined the analogies between the cutting, boring, striking\r\nand grasping tools of Nature and Art, we come to those finishing tools\r\nwhich smooth and polish the surface.\r\n\r\nThe first is the File, an instrument which needs but little description.\r\nIt consists of a surface of hardened steel, broken up into rough-edged\r\nteeth of infinite variety, according to the work which the file has to\r\ndo. It is rather remarkable, by the way, that at present the English\r\nfiles are infinitely superior to those produced in any other part of the\r\nworld; that their teeth are all made by hand; and that a genuine\r\nSheffield file will first cut its way through a piece of iron in half\r\nthe time that would be occupied by a file of any other nation, and then\r\nwould easily cut its antagonist in two.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAS long as the File is intended to work upon metal, there is little\r\ndifficulty in its manufacture, except that no machinery has yet been\r\ninvented which can give the peculiar edging of the ridges, and to which\r\nis owing the unmistakable “bite” of a real English file.\r\n\r\nBut there are occasions when the hand of the most cunning file-maker is\r\nbaffled, and when it is necessary to cut files so delicate that the\r\nunaided human eye cannot trace their teeth. Art, therefore, has recourse\r\nto Nature, and the cabinet-maker, who cannot obtain any file made by\r\nhuman hands which will answer his purpose in the higher branches of his\r\ntrade, makes great use of the “Dutch Rush,” as he calls it. It is not a\r\nrush at all, but simply a species of Mare’s Tail, or Equisetum, a plant\r\nwhich fills in profusion almost every marshy spot in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EQUISETUM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILE.]\r\n\r\nThe peculiar fitness of the Equisetum for this purpose cannot be\r\nappreciated even by those who use it until it has been viewed under the\r\nmicroscope. I have now before me a small piece of Equisetum, placed\r\nunder a half-inch power, and viewed by direct illumination, it being\r\ntreated as an opaque object.\r\n\r\nThe microscope reveals at a glance the source of the power which the\r\ningenuity of man has taken advantage of. The surface of the Equisetum is\r\nseen to be composed of myriads of tiny parallel ridges, each ridge\r\nbristling with rows of flinty spicules, looking very much like the\r\nbroken glass upon the top of a wall. Minute as they are, these spicules\r\ncan do their work, and they enable the joiner to finish off work in a\r\nmanner that could not be accomplished by any tool made by human hands.\r\n\r\nI find, by recent inquiries, that modern joiners scarcely, if ever, use\r\nthe Equisetum, preferring emery-paper as cheaper and more expeditious,\r\nand knowing that the popular eye is not able to appreciate the\r\ndifference of the surface obtained by the Equisetum from that which is\r\ngiven by the finest emery-paper ever made. Wood-carvers, however, if\r\nthey be of the conscientious kind, and love their work for its own sake,\r\nadhere to the Dutch Rush, and are all the happier for it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASS we now to the coarser kinds of polishers, the chief of which is\r\npopularly known as Sand-paper, and is made by coating some tissue with\r\nglue, and scattering upon it sand of different qualities, according to\r\nthe work to be done. Sometimes, when the work is rough, the sand is\r\nlarge, rough, and coarse, and sometimes, when the work is fine, the sand\r\nis so carefully sifted before it is scattered on the glued paper, that\r\nthere is little distinction between the sand-paper and emery-paper.\r\nLinen, by the way, is generally used instead of paper, as being more\r\nenduring, less liable to crack, and capable of being folded so as to\r\nobtain access to crevices which paper could not touch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOG-FISH SKIN, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAND-PAPER, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAGAIN in Nature we find a parallel, and the coarse Sand-paper of modern\r\nArt has long been anticipated in the scale-clad skins of many fishes.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration is taken from the skin of a Picked\r\nDog-fish found by myself lying dead on the rocks in Bideford Bay. I cut\r\noff a piece for transmission to the draftsman, and found that not only\r\ndid it feel exactly like cutting through a piece of very common\r\nsand-paper, but that it blunted the edge of a new knife in exactly the\r\nsame manner as would have been done by the roughest of sand-paper.\r\n\r\nThis kind of skin is common to all the shark tribe (including the\r\nDog-fishes, which are but sharks in miniature), and to the Skate,\r\nSaw-fish, &c. I have now before me a small, but perfect example of the\r\nSaw-fish, the surface of which is covered with flinty scales like those\r\nof the Dog-fish, but very much smaller, requiring the aid of a\r\nmagnifying lens to distinguish them. Even to guess at the number of them\r\nis impossible, for they cover the whole of the body, and extend to the\r\nvery end of the beak, in some places glittering in a strong light as if\r\npounded glass had been sprinkled all over the fish. One of the most\r\ninteresting points in their structure is the manner in which they reach\r\nthe rounded jaws, and there become converted into teeth powerful enough\r\nto crush the animals on which the fish live. The structure of these jaws\r\nwill be explained in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nSome of the skates and sharks have these scales of great size, so as to\r\nshow their formation almost without the aid of a magnifying-glass. This\r\nis the case with a species of skate, the skin of which is used by the\r\nJapanese for wrapping round the handles of their best swords, and which\r\nis greatly valued by that nation, the sword being an almost sacred\r\narticle in the eyes of a Japanese.\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known museum in which these swords are labelled as\r\nhaving handles of “granulated ivory.” Now, in the first place, there is\r\nno such thing as granulated ivory; and, in the next, a mere glance ought\r\nto tell the observer that the so-called ivory is a skin of some sort,\r\nworked upon the handle while wet, and kept in its place by copper studs.\r\nEven the junction of the edges is perceptible, and yet the authorities\r\nof the museum in question, although they have been repeatedly corrected,\r\nstill persist in calling the skate-skin by the absurd title of\r\ngranulated ivory.\r\n\r\nHowever, if ivory could be granulated, it would certainly look very much\r\nlike the skate-skin. When examined closely, the scales, whether of\r\nDog-fish, Skate, Shark, or Saw-fish, are seen to resemble hexagonal\r\ncones, not coming quite to a point, but truncated, so as to have an\r\nhexagonal flattened tip. They are almost of a flinty hardness,\r\nespecially at their tips, and on inspection of them the observer is not\r\nsurprised at the use of Dog-fish skin in place of sand-paper.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may ask why the Equisetum should be taken as the\r\nprototype of the file, and the skin of the Dog-fish as that of\r\nsand-paper. The reason is this. The flinty points of the Equisetum are\r\nset upon parallel ridges something like those of a file, while the\r\nscales of the Dog-fish are without any apparent order, being crowded\r\nagainst each other like the cutting particles upon the sand-paper. That\r\nthere should not be an order, and that a definite one, is out of the\r\nquestion. But it has not yet been detected by human eyes, and therefore\r\nmay be practically treated as non-existent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOLS OF MEASUREMENT.\r\n\r\nIn many of the arts, more especially those which belong to engineering\r\nand carpentering as a part of architecture, it is absolutely necessary\r\nto make sure of a perpendicular line, _i.e._ a line which, if continued,\r\nwould reach from any point of the earth’s surface to its exact centre\r\nbelow and its zenith above. Were it not for the power of producing this\r\nline, none of the great engineering works of modern or ancient days\r\ncould have been undertaken.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the wonderful tunnels which have been driven through\r\nthe earth, of which the Mont Cenis Tunnel is one of the greatest\r\ntriumphs of modern engineering. Beginning, as the workmen did, at\r\nopposite ends of a tunnel many miles in length, and labouring only by\r\nthe lines laid down by the engineers, the men worked steadily on until\r\nthey met in the centre.\r\n\r\nA few blows, and the then narrow dividing wall was shattered, the men\r\nshook hands through the aperture, and then, after enlarging it, leaped\r\nwildly from one side to the other, having successfully solved the great\r\nproblem. With such marvellous precision had the lines been laid, that\r\nonly a few inches had to be smoothed down on either side, and the sides\r\nor walls of the tunnel showed no traces of the junction.\r\n\r\nSo rapid has been the progress of engineering that a tunnel of a mile in\r\nlength would, within the memory of man, have been thought as daring a\r\nproject as was the Mont Cenis Tunnel, which has just been given as an\r\nexample. Indeed, I know of a railway tunnel, not quite a mile in length,\r\nwhere the engineers had committed some error, so that the two halves,\r\ninstead of meeting exactly, overlapped each other so much that the\r\nmistake was only discovered by the workmen, who heard the strokes of\r\ntheir companions’ picks on their sides, and not in front. Consequently,\r\na great waste of time took place, and the centre of the tunnel had to be\r\nmade with a double curve, like the letter S, and trains are obliged to\r\nslacken speed until they have passed it.\r\n\r\nThose who have lived long enough to remember the current literature of\r\nthe past generation will call to mind the ridicule that was cast upon\r\nthe idea of a tunnel that should pass under the Thames. That it would be\r\nuseful if it could be completed, no one ventured to doubt, but that such\r\nan idea could be conceived by any one out of a lunatic asylum was rather\r\ntoo much for the journalists of the day. However, the tunnel was made,\r\nand so proved the theorists wrong on the one side. And, when made, it\r\nwas of very little use, which proved them wrong on the other side. Now\r\nthe proposal to carry a submarine tunnel from England to France excites\r\nnot half the opposition that was elicited by the comparative\r\nchild’s-play of a tunnel under the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe only mode of laying down the lines on which the men worked is by\r\nsuspending very heavy balls to very fine wires, and then, by means of\r\ndelicate optical instruments, ascertaining whether the wires are in line\r\nwith each other.\r\n\r\nFamiliar instances of the use of this principle may be seen in the\r\nplumb-rule and level of the builder or carpenter. The latter, with a\r\nbase of ten feet in length, is often used by the gardener when he wishes\r\nto lay the absolutely level lawns that are required for our modern game\r\nof croquet, where the hoops are scarcely wider than the balls, and the\r\nlawn has in consequence to be nearly as level as a billiard table.\r\n\r\nI may here remark that the name plumb-rule is derived from the Latin\r\nword _plumbum_, or lead, in allusion to the leaden weight at the end of\r\nthe string. The word “plumber” is due to the same source, and signifies\r\na worker in lead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHESE invaluable aids to the development of civilisation are due to one\r\nprinciple, namely, that which we call Gravitation, but which ought more\r\nproperly to be termed Attraction, and which attracts all parts of the\r\nearth towards its centre. We are all familiar with the anecdote of\r\nNewton and the falling apple, which may be true or not, but which at\r\nall events bears on the present subject. No matter on what portion of\r\nthe spherical earth a tree may be, every fruit becoming disengaged from\r\nit is attracted to the earth, the line which it takes, unless disturbed\r\nby external forces (such as wind, &c.), being that which passes from the\r\nzenith to the centre of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FALLING FRUIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLUMB-RULE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEVEL.]\r\n\r\nThis imaginary line is a perfect perpendicular, and the visible line\r\nwhich is formed by the delicate wire of the tunnel-boring engineering\r\ninstrument, or the comparatively coarse string of the plumb-rule and\r\nlevel, are approximations sufficiently close for practical purposes. So\r\nit is in a mathematical proposition. As mathematical lines have no\r\nbreadth, they are simply indicated or represented by the lines of the\r\nfigure, the bodily eye being incapable of seeing what is perfectly\r\nvisible to the mental eye, namely, length without width. So the wire and\r\nstring perform in practical work exactly the same office which is\r\nfulfilled by the lines of a mathematical proposition drawn on paper.\r\n\r\nWe have already, when treating of the Fall-trap, seen how this principle\r\nis brought into operation by those who are utterly incapable of\r\ndiscerning the physical principle, though they can apply it materially\r\nwith wonderful effect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is, perhaps, needless to mention the value of the Measure to any\r\nhandicraftsman.\r\n\r\nI well remember that when, some twenty-four years ago, I was taking\r\nlessons from a carpenter in the art of making ladders, gates, fences,\r\nhurdles, and other rough-and-ready work, my quaint old tutor related an\r\nanecdote of and against himself. He very ingeniously set me to work at\r\nboring the auger-holes in the gate-posts which were to be united by the\r\nmortise chisel and mallet, and to sweeten the rather severe, because\r\nunaccustomed, labour, told me that, when he was a boy, he was doing just\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\nBeing rather tired of twisting the auger handle (and no wonder either),\r\nhe withdrew the instrument, and put his finger into the hole by way of\r\nascertaining its depth. Immediately he found himself on his back, having\r\nreceived a tremendous box on the ear from his father, whose parental\r\nwrath was excited by the idea of his son condescending to use his finger\r\nby way of measure, when he had a two-foot rule in its own special\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many cases where even a two-foot rule would be\r\ninsufficient for the work, and where a measure of thirty or forty feet\r\nis needed.\r\n\r\nNow, there is no doubt that by means of a two-foot, or even a six-inch,\r\nrule any number of feet might be measured accurately; but, considering\r\nthe number of junctions that have to be made, it is not likely that any\r\npretence to accuracy could be insured.\r\n\r\nThen, a rod of forty, or even of twenty, feet in length would be awkward\r\nand unmanageable, and the only plan left is to take a string or cord of\r\nthe requisite length.\r\n\r\nEven here, however, is a difficulty. The string would not allow of short\r\nmeasurements, such as inches, being written upon it. Let, however, a\r\nbroad tape of inelastic material be substituted for the string, and all\r\nis easy enough.\r\n\r\nThe next plan is to provide for the portability of the tape in question,\r\nto insure its reduction into the smallest possible compass, and to be\r\nsure that it is not twisted so as to damage its accuracy. These objects\r\nare all attained by the ordinary Tape Measure of the present day, which,\r\nwhether it be a yard measure in a lady’s workbox, or a surveyor’s\r\nmeasuring tape, is a ribbon of comparatively inelastic material, coiled\r\nup when not wanted, and capable of being drawn out to its fullest\r\nextreme when needed.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the breadth of the line, and consequently disregarding the\r\nliability to twist, we have in the Fishing-reel of the modern angler an\r\nexact case in point. So we have in the lady’s yard measure, and in the\r\ngardener’s or builder’s tape, all these being modifications of the same\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVIPOSITOR OF GALL-FLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPRING MEASURE.]\r\n\r\nSuppose now that we pass to Nature, so as to ascertain whether any such\r\nprovisions were in existence before it was imitated, however\r\nunconsciously, by man. This certainly was the case with one of the\r\ncommonest and most insignificant of our insects, the little Gall-fly,\r\nbelonging to the genus Cynips. It could not lay its eggs without the aid\r\nof a very long ovipositor, and, owing to structural details, it cannot\r\ncarry that ovipositor in a straight line, as is done by many insects,\r\nsome of which have already been mentioned. Accordingly, it is coiled up\r\nexactly like our measuring tapes, and can be unrolled when needed. The\r\nlong, protrusible tongues of the Wryneck, Creeper, and Woodpecker are\r\nexamples of a similar structure, the tendinous portions being coiled\r\nround the head when not needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT-LEVEL.\r\n\r\nHaving now seen how the forces of Nature enable us to produce a\r\nperfectly perpendicular line, we will see how the same force, though\r\napplied in a different manner, enables us to produce a perfectly\r\nhorizontal line, the intersection of the two lines producing a right\r\nangle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOATING BUBBLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIRIT-LEVEL.]\r\n\r\nThe measuring tool in question is called the Spirit-level, and is\r\nrepresented on the right hand of the accompanying illustration. Its\r\nconstruction is very simple, consisting of a tube, nearly filled with\r\nspirit, and having just one bubble of air in it. Now, owing to the force\r\nof gravitation, the air-bubble must always be uppermost. Consequently,\r\nif the tube be a perfect cylinder, whenever it is held so that the\r\nbubble is in the centre, the tube must be horizontal, a hair’s breadth\r\nof deviation altering the line. I may here mention that, as far as the\r\nprinciple of the instrument goes, water would serve the purpose as\r\neffectively as spirit. But as in cold weather the water might freeze,\r\nand so burst the tube, as well as being useless until it was thawed,\r\nspirit is always substituted.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is used for various purposes. Sometimes it is employed\r\nfor levelling billiard tables, or for ascertaining the exact level of\r\nwalls and other parts of buildings. Surveyors could scarcely do their\r\nwork without the Spirit-level, which forms an important part of their\r\nchief instrument, the theodolite. Indeed, the new science of land\r\ndrainage, by which the tough, unproductive clay soil is converted into\r\nfertile earth, is entirely dependent on the use of the Spirit-level,\r\nwhich detects the slightest rise or fall in the ground.\r\n\r\nA most ingenious modification of the Spirit-level is used by military\r\nengineers, and is known by the name of the “Contouring-glass,” a term\r\nwhich requires some explanation.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that a military engineer should be able,\r\nwhether on foot or on horseback, to ascertain the approximate heights of\r\nthe various points which he visits, the efficiency or failure of a\r\nbattery very much depending on the comparative elevation of the spot on\r\nwhich the battery is placed, and that of the place against which its\r\nfire is directed. In an unknown country, of which no detailed maps\r\nexist, an invading force must of necessity depend on the extemporised\r\nsurveys of their engineer officers, and one of the most valuable of\r\ntheir devices is the system of Contouring, invented, as far as I know,\r\nby the late Colonel Hutchinson, R.E.\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple enough. A hill is seen, and the engineer makes a\r\nsketch of it before he ascends. At the foot he halts, and marks the spot\r\nwhere his foot presses the earth. He then looks in front at a spot\r\nexactly on the level of his eye, marks it, and walks to it. He then\r\ndraws a line across his sketch, at the exact spot on which he is\r\nstanding, and that is the first “contouring line.” Others follow, until\r\nhe has reached the top of the hill.\r\n\r\nNow, if he can trust himself to look exactly horizontally, he has\r\nascertained the elevation of every part of the hill. He knows the height\r\nof his eye from the sole of his foot, and calculates accordingly.\r\nSuppose, for example, that it be five feet, and that ten contouring\r\nlines are marked, he knows that the entire height is fifty feet, and\r\nthat each line means an elevation of five feet.\r\n\r\nThis is a very excellent theory, but one which is not reduced to\r\npractice so easily as it looks. There is nothing more deceptive than a\r\ncontour, especially upon an irregular hill, the invariable mistakes\r\nbeing either greatly to overrate or underrate the height of the contour.\r\nWhen I took my first lesson in this art I caused much amusement to the\r\nprofessor under whom I was studying, by making Shooter’s Hill consist of\r\nabout seventeen contours. However, as many military students made very\r\nmuch the same mistake, I was not so humiliated as I supposed.\r\n\r\nOf course, if a surveying officer be mounted, he takes the contour line\r\nas measured from his eye to the ground through the centre of the saddle.\r\n\r\nAfter some practice the eye becomes so much accustomed to the contouring\r\nlines that they are taken almost mechanically; but, until this result be\r\ngained, an absolute proof is needed, which is furnished by the\r\nContouring-glass--which, by the way, is not a glass at all, after the\r\ncommon acceptation of the word.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple brass tube about three inches long, not thicker than a\r\nman’s little finger, and open throughout. A small spirit-level is fixed\r\non its lower surface, and on the very centre of the upper surface is a\r\ntiny steel mirror, which projects downwards like a knife-blade. In order\r\nto get a “contour,” the observer looks through the tube, slightly\r\ndepressing its end. He then gradually raises it, still looking through\r\nit. As the tube becomes exactly horizontal the bubble in the\r\nspirit-level is reflected in the little mirror, and the object on which\r\nthe tube is directed is in consequence on a level with the observer’s\r\neye.\r\n\r\nAt first the management of the contouring-glass is rather tedious; but\r\nafter a little practice it can be used without pausing for a single\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINVALUABLE as is the Spirit-level, with its various modifications, it is\r\nnothing but an adaptation of that natural law which causes the bubbles\r\nto float on the surface of a stream instead of being submerged below\r\nit. We have all seen the multitudinous bubbles of soda-water, or of any\r\neffervescing liquid, and have noticed how they are very small when\r\ngenerated, but enlarge quickly, and rise to the surface with a rapidity\r\nequal to their enlargement. The same phenomena may be observed in any\r\nwater-fall, or even in the very familiar and unpoetical operation of\r\npouring beer from a jug into a glass.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see that in the plumb-rule, the level, and the\r\nspirit-level one single principle is employed, namely, the attraction of\r\nmatter towards the centre of the earth. In the two former instruments\r\nthis attraction gives a vertical line, and in the latter it gives a\r\nhorizontal line, but the principle is the same in both.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLIPERS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAWS OF SIALIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALLIPERS.]\r\n\r\nWe conclude the history of measuring tools with the Callipers. For\r\nordinary purposes, and upon a plane surface, the Compasses answer every\r\npurpose. But there are various arts, especially sculpture, in which the\r\ncompasses, with their straight legs, are absolutely valueless, and their\r\nplace must be supplied by a differently shaped instrument. For example,\r\nno ordinary compasses could measure the exact distance from the nostril\r\nto the back of the head, or even touch two points at opposite sides of a\r\nlimb, and it is therefore necessary to have compasses with curved legs.\r\nThese are termed Callipers, and can be used on a plane as well as on a\r\nrounded surface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATURAL Callipers are plentiful enough, and may be found extensively\r\namong the insect tribes. There are, for example, the pincers of the\r\nEarwig, which have already been described on page 259, and which are, in\r\nthe common species, formed exactly like the Callipers of the sculptor.\r\n\r\nThen we have various insect jaws, especially those of the carnivorous\r\nspecies, one of the most curious being the large insect which is shown\r\nin the illustration, upon a very reduced scale. In the male the jaws are\r\nexceedingly long and curved, as may be seen by reference to the\r\nillustration. I have now before me a pair of sculptor’s callipers, and\r\nthe resemblance between them and the jaws of the Sialis is strangely\r\nclose, the curve being almost exactly the same in both cases.\r\n\r\nThe scientific name of this insect is _Sialis armata_, and it is a\r\nnative of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE MISSIONS OF HISTORY.--THE CAMERA OBSCURA.--LONG AND SHORT\r\nSIGHT.--STEREOSCOPE AND PSEUDOSCOPE.--MULTIPLYING-GLASSES.\r\n\r\n     The Camera Obscura.--Telescopes, Microscopes, and Spectroscopes,\r\n     and their separate Objects.--Structure of the Camera Obscura.--The\r\n     Double Convex Lens.--Its Use as a Burning-glass.--The Meridian Gun\r\n     in Paris.--Signification of the Word “Focus.”--The Human Eye and\r\n     its Analogies to the Camera Obscura.--Forms of various\r\n     Lenses.--Long and Short Sight.--Their Causes and Means of\r\n     Remedy.--Alteration of Sight in the Diver.--Long and Short sighted\r\n     Spectacles.--The Eye of Birds.--Its beautiful\r\n     Structure.--Washing-glasses and the “Nictitating”\r\n     Membrane.--Combination of Images.--Natural Stereoscopes.--The\r\n     Pseudoscope and its Effects on an Object.--The\r\n     Multiplying-glass.--The Eight Eyes of the Spider and their\r\n     Arrangement.--The Seventy Thousand Eyes of the Butterfly.--Form of\r\n     the Facets.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory seems to fall into natural divisions, and to write the records\r\nof time in successive epochs, recording the advance of the human race.\r\nSome of them have apparently disappeared except by the strange relics\r\nwhich they have left behind, but though nothing is known of the men who\r\nworked in these ancient times, they stamped their mark upon the earth,\r\nand evidently left the world better than they found it.\r\n\r\nA very admirable treatise on this subject has been written by the late\r\nRev. J. Smith, called the “Divine Drama of Creation.” In this work he\r\ndivides the progress of the human race into five acts, like those of a\r\ndrama. The first act is the Hebrew Mission, the second the Greek\r\nMission, the third the Roman Mission and the Middle Ages, the fourth the\r\nNational Mission, and the fifth the Universal Mission.\r\n\r\nCertainly a scene of the last act is now in progress, and may be\r\nentitled the Scientific Mission. The last hundred years have been indeed\r\nthe age of discovery, and, during that time, the life of civilised man\r\nhas been quite altered, so that practically his sojourn upon earth has\r\nbeen doubled. Steam, with all its various applications, electricity, and\r\nother kindred arts have become so intermingled with our lives, that it\r\nis difficult to imagine what our state would be if we were suddenly and\r\nutterly deprived of them. The loss to all would be incalculable, and not\r\nthe least of the losses would be that of ready communion with our\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nOf these arts we will now take that which is named at the head of this\r\ndivision of the book, and see how far it is a development of natural\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMERA OBSCURA AND THE EYE.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of arts as being akin to each other. They are more\r\nthan this, and every day of the world’s progress teaches us that Art,\r\nScience, and Manufacture are sisters, all born of one family, and all\r\ndepending mutually on each other.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, our present theme--namely, Optics--and see how\r\ndependent it is upon Manufacture and Art. Without the former, man could\r\nnot construct those beautiful telescopes, microscopes, spectroscopes, of\r\nthe present day, which are evidently but the precursors of instruments\r\nwhich will work still greater marvels.\r\n\r\nThe first enables us to see solar systems without number, to which our\r\nown, vast as it seems to us, is but as a grain of sand in the desert.\r\nThe next instrument makes revelations as marvellous of the infinitely\r\nminute as does the telescope of the infinitely great, enabling us to see\r\nliving organizations so small that thirty-two millions could swim in a\r\ncubic inch of water. The third, a comparatively modern instrument,\r\nreveals the composition of objects, and can detect and register the\r\nmaterials of which the sun and fixed stars are made, or detect an\r\nadulteration in wine. It can adapt itself equally to the telescope and\r\nmicroscope, and the very same instrument which will reveal the character\r\nof an invisible gas in the Pole-star, when attached to the telescope,\r\ncan, when connected with the microscope, point out the presence of half\r\na corpuscle of blood where no other instrument could discover any trace\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nAll these instruments, together with many others, will be described in\r\nthe present division of the work, and their analogies with Nature shown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now take the subject of the Camera Obscura, an instrument with\r\nwhich the photographic apparatus of the present day has made most of us\r\nfamiliar. As its action depends chiefly upon the glass, or lens, through\r\nwhich the rays of light pass into the instrument, we will first explain\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nA “lens” is a glass formed in such a manner that the rays of light which\r\npass through it either converge to a focus, or are dispersed, by means\r\nof the law of refraction. Every one who has been photographed--and who\r\nhas not?--will remember that when the sitter has taken his position, the\r\nphotographer brings to bear upon him a circular glass fixed into a short\r\ntube, and then looks through the instrument as if he were taking aim\r\nwith some species of firearm. It is no matter of wonder that when\r\nsavages see the photographic camera for the first time they are horribly\r\nfrightened, for there is really something weird-like in the appearance\r\nof the lens thus presented.\r\n\r\nNow, this lens is of the shape called “double convex,” both sides being\r\nequally rounded, so that a section of it would be shaped very much like\r\na parenthesis (). The effect of this form of lens is to bring the rays\r\nof light to a point at a given distance from the centre. This point is\r\ncalled the “focus,” and is well known by means of the common\r\nburning-glass, which will set fire to objects placed in its focus, while\r\nitself remains quite cool.\r\n\r\nI have seen lead pour down like water when placed in the focus of a\r\nlarge burning-glass, and even the harder metals will yield to the power\r\nof the sun’s rays when thus concentrated.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing which gives a more vivid idea of the amount of heat\r\nthrown on the earth by the rays of the sun than the effects of a\r\nmoderately large burning-glass--say one of six inches in diameter. If we\r\ntrace a circle of this size on the surface of the earth, it does not\r\nseem as if any very great amount of heat can be received, but when we\r\ncatch the rays of that circle in our glass, and bring them together upon\r\nthe focus, the amount of heat can be appreciated. The well-known\r\nmeridian gun in the Palais Royal is fired by the sun. A burning-glass of\r\nno very great size is placed over the touch-hole of the gun, with which\r\nits focus coincides. The lens is turned in such a manner that, as the\r\nsun attains the meridian, its rays are thrown upon the touch-hole, and\r\nconsequently fire the gun.\r\n\r\nThe word _focus_ is the Latin term for a domestic hearth, and is used in\r\nallusion to the heat which is manifested at the point on which the rays\r\nof the sun converge.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, after reaching the focus, the rays, if they be not\r\nintercepted by some object, will cross each other, and form a large\r\nimage, but reversed. This part of the subject will presently be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE accompanying illustration shows two figures, one representing the\r\nsection of a double convex lens made by the hands of man, and the other\r\nthat of a double convex lens as seen in Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRYSTALLINE LENS OF HUMAN EYE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE CONVEX LENS.]\r\n\r\nThe former has already been explained. The latter is the double convex\r\nlens of the human eye, by means of which the images of external objects\r\nare conveyed to the brain. Whenever this lens becomes thickened by\r\ndisease, the sight is gradually dimmed, and at last total blindness is\r\nthe result. This disease is popularly called “cataract,” and until late\r\ndays was incurable. Now, however, any good oculist will attack a\r\ncataract, and either partially or entirely restore the sight. This\r\noperation is performed by carefully removing the convex lens, and\r\nsupplying its place with a glass lens, which throws the rays of light on\r\nthe same focus.\r\n\r\nThe figure shows the double convex lens of the human eye in its place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHAVING now seen something of the properties of the double convex lens,\r\nwe will examine its application to the Camera Obscura.\r\n\r\nThe lens is placed on one side of the camera, and is so made that it can\r\nbe slid backwards and forwards, and the focus altered at will. The\r\ncamera itself is a box completely closed, so that no light can enter it\r\nexcept that which passes through the lens. The latter is so arranged\r\nthat the rays which pass through it are crossed, and throw their image\r\non the opposite side of the camera. In the photographic camera a piece\r\nof ground glass is placed at the end, so that the rays fall upon it, and\r\nthe operator can see whether the image is a good one. Of course the\r\nfigures are reversed, so that the sitter seems to be on his head, but\r\nthat is a matter of no consequence. Exactly the same effect is produced\r\nby the marine telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EYE AND IMAGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMERA OBSCURA AND IMAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the camera is shown in the illustration, all\r\nneedless details being omitted.\r\n\r\nI may here remark that the term “camera obscura,” or dark chamber,\r\nalludes to the fact that the box is completely closed, and, but for the\r\nrays which pass through the lens, would be absolutely dark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE opposite illustration shows the most perfect camera obscura that can\r\nbe imagined, namely, the human eye. Here we have a dark chamber, a\r\ndouble convex lens, and an image falling upon the back. Here the optic\r\nnerve comes into play, takes cognisance of the image, and conveys the\r\nidea to the brain. With a little trouble, a real eye, say that of an\r\nox, can be dissected out, and employed as a camera obscura, the operator\r\nseeing in the back of the eye, or “retina,” the same image which the ox\r\nwould have seen if it had been alive.\r\n\r\nIn photography, the operator, when he has found that a perfect image is\r\nthrown upon the ground glass, which represents the retina of the eye,\r\nsubstitutes for it a sensitive surface, on which the rays are projected,\r\nand which, by chemical means, produce a permanent instead of a fleeting\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES of other lenses may be found in Nature. She, moreover, can\r\nperform a task which man has never even attempted, namely, the change of\r\nform in a lens according to the duty which it has to do. How this\r\nwonderful object is attained we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nThere is a form of lens extremely useful in Optics, namely, the\r\n“Plano-convex” lens. This is, in fact, one half of a double convex lens,\r\nthe section being made through its edges, and the plane sides polished\r\nas well as the convex. As, however, this is only a half of the double\r\nconvex lens, it does not need further explanation. Its natural\r\ncounterpart may be seen in the annexed illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUMAN EYE: SECTION OF CORNEA, &C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANO-CONVEX LENS.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat more complicated form of lens is called the “Meniscus,” one\r\nside of which is convex and the other concave. A good example of the\r\nmeniscus may be found in the old-fashioned watch-glass, before\r\nwatchmakers took to flattening them, and watch-wearers were not ashamed\r\nto carry a “turnip,” in which there was room to spare for the works. If\r\na section of such a glass were taken, it would assume the form of a\r\nhalf-moon. This, in fact, is the meaning of the term “meniscus,” which\r\nis a Greek word, signifying a little moon. If the same glass were solid,\r\nor even filled with water, it would form a “plano-convex” lens.\r\n\r\nOf course the outer curve of the meniscus must be larger than the inner\r\ncurve, but in some cases the disproportion is very strongly marked, the\r\nouter curve being very large, and the inner curve very small. An example\r\nof such a meniscus may be seen in the human eye. If the reader will\r\nrefer to the illustration on page 280, in which the structure of the eye\r\nis shown, he will see the meniscus lens in combination with the double\r\nconvex. The former has already been explained, and the latter is formed\r\nby the vitreous humour which fills nearly the entire globe of the eye.\r\nIts larger curve is due to the form of the eyeball, and the smaller to\r\nthe convex lens.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG AND SHORT SIGHT.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that the focus of a convex lens is shorter\r\nin proportion to its convexity, and that in consequence its magnifying\r\npower is increased. For example, the large glasses through which\r\npictures are viewed are comparatively thin in proportion to their\r\ndiameter, while the lenses employed for the highest powers of the\r\nmicroscope are scarcely larger than small shot, and nearly as globular.\r\nIt naturally follows that any instrument to which a lens is adapted,\r\nwhether it be microscope or telescope, must depend for its focus on the\r\ngreater or less convexity of the lens in question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRAME OF OWL’S EYE. LENS OF DITTO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHORT AND LONG SIGHTED EYES (WITH SPECTACLES).]\r\n\r\nAgain taking as our example the human eye, we find that there are very\r\nfew persons who from youth to age possess or preserve eyes which can\r\nread small type at a moderate distance, and can clearly define the\r\noutlines of distant objects. Nearly all people, even if in their youth\r\nthey possess good sight, lose it as they grow older. They can discern\r\ndistant objects well enough, but, when they come to reading, they are\r\nobliged to hold the book at arm’s length before they can distinguish the\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nThis defect is caused by the insufficient convexity of the lens, so that\r\nthe focus is thrown too far back, and it is corrected by wearing\r\nspectacles sufficiently convex to supply the deficiency in the lens of\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\nAn admirable example of temporary long-sightedness is familiar to every\r\ndiver, though he may be unconscious of its cause. Suppose that into very\r\nclear water of some twelve feet in depth, a white object, say a common\r\njam-pot, is thrown, it can be clearly discerned from the shore,\r\nunaltered in shape or size. But, when the diver searches for it, he sees\r\nat first only something white, large, undefined, and wavering, and only\r\nfinds it resume its proportions as he approaches it. This phenomenon is\r\ndue to the pressure of the water upon the eyeball, which flattens it,\r\nand so throws the focus too far back for a clear image. Nowadays this\r\ndefect is remedied by the use of very convex spectacles, so convex,\r\nindeed, that, if worn in the air, they would render the wearer incapable\r\nof seeing anything at more than an inch or so away from him. But, when\r\nworn in the water, they only supply the deficiency of the compressed\r\neyeball, and so restore the focus to its proper position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHOSE who suffer from short-sightedness can see with great distinctness\r\nobjects which are close at hand, but those at a little distance seem to\r\nhave no particular outline, and appear as if they were viewed through a\r\nfog, thus causing a constant and almost painful strain on the eyes. The\r\ncause of this defect is the too great convexity of the lens, which\r\ntherefore throws its focus short of the required spot. The means of\r\nremedy are exactly opposite to those which are used for long-sighted\r\npersons, a concave lens being placed in front of the eye, so as to throw\r\nthe focus farther back, and relieve the organ from the strain.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have not yet invented a machine that can alter the focus at\r\nwill, we may take a hint from Nature. We have already seen how the\r\npressure of water upon the front of the eye lessens its convexity, and\r\nmakes it long-sighted. Consequently, if we could apply pressure round\r\nit, we could make it more convex, and so neutralise the weight of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful piece of machinery in Nature which really does\r\nperform this office, the eye, at the will of its owner, becoming either\r\ntelescopic or microscopic. This quality is very desirable in birds,\r\nespecially those which are predacious and of rapid flight, as they might\r\neither fail to see their prey at a distance, or might dash themselves\r\nagainst some obstacle when they were close upon it.\r\n\r\nThe eye of the Owl affords a beautiful example of machinery which\r\nproduces this effect, and the means which are used may be understood by\r\ninspecting the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the eyeball is set in a framework composed of thin\r\nbony plates, just like a glass in a telescope. When these plates are\r\nrelaxed, the whole eyeball is flattened, so as to enable the bird to see\r\nan object at a very great distance. But, when they are contracted, they\r\nrender the whole eye globular in proportion to their pressure, and\r\nenable the bird to see objects which are very close to it. In fact, the\r\neye becomes a telescope or microscope as needed.\r\n\r\nMany reptiles possess this arrangement of bones, but the birds have even\r\na more delicate mode of obtaining the focus of the eye. This is by means\r\nof a curious organ called, from its shape, the “pecten,” or comb, which\r\nis placed in the vitreous humour at the back of the eye, and connected\r\nwith the optic nerve. It is a congeries of arteries and veins, so that\r\nit can be rapidly enlarged by forcing blood into it, or diminished by\r\nallowing the blood to withdraw.\r\n\r\nAs the liquid in which it rests is practically incompressible, it\r\nfollows that when the comb expands, it causes the chamber of the\r\nvitreous fluid to expand, and so forces the lens forward. When, however,\r\nthe blood retires from the comb, the lens returns to its original place.\r\nThis, as the reader may have noticed, is the same principle as that\r\nwhich is followed in altering the focus of a telescope in order to suit\r\nthe sight of different individuals. Perhaps a still better illustration\r\nmay be found in the coarse and fine adjustment of the microscope, the\r\nformer of which moves the whole tube, and may be compared to the bony\r\nring; while the latter causes one part to slide over the other, and is\r\nanalogous to the comb.\r\n\r\nThe movements of this organ are believed to be as involuntary as the\r\ndilatation and contraction of the iris; but, whatever may be the case,\r\nit is one of the most beautiful examples of natural mechanics, and far\r\nsurpasses the most delicate machine that can be made by man.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration of the microscope, which is to be found on page 286,\r\nboth these movements are given, the double vertical wheel being the\r\ncoarse movement, and the fine movement being supplied by the single\r\nvertical wheel just above them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHILE we are on this subject, we may see how Art unintentionally copies\r\nNature, even in trivial details. Every one who is in the habit of using\r\noptical instruments, more especially those who are forced to wear\r\nspectacles, are aware of the necessity of keeping the glasses as clean\r\nas possible, and, where the instruments are delicate, always have by\r\nthem a piece of clean wash-leather for the express purpose of wiping the\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\nHere, again, Nature has anticipated Art. In our own case, we have in the\r\nhuman eye a good example of such natural mechanism, the eyelids being\r\nformed quite as much for the purpose of washing the surface of the\r\neyeball as of excluding light.\r\n\r\nMany animals are provided with a special apparatus for the purpose,\r\ncalled the “nictitating membrane.” It is, in fact, a sort of inner or\r\nsupplementary eyelid, which can be drawn over the eye while the external\r\nlids remain comparatively unmoved. It is very conspicuous in the owls,\r\nand gives to those birds that almost comical look of perpetual blinking\r\nwith which we are so familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEREOSCOPE AND PSEUDOSCOPE.\r\n\r\nMany persons have wondered how it happens that, as we have two eyes, we\r\ndo not see two images instead of one. Practically, this is always the\r\ncase, for the eyes, especially when they look on solid bodies, see two\r\ndifferent images, because they contemplate the object from different\r\npoints of sight.\r\n\r\nThis may be easily ascertained by looking at a given object first with\r\none eye, and then with the other, when it will be seen that the image\r\npresented to the right eye is slightly different from that of the left\r\neye, but that the two can be combined into one by a very slight inward\r\nmovement of both eyes, and thus the effect of a solid body be produced.\r\nSometimes, when people are weak, and cannot control the united movement\r\nof the eyes, not only two, but five or six images are at once presented\r\nto the mind, and produce a strange sense of bewilderment and confusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMBINATION OF HUMAN EYES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEREOSCOPE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BINOCULAR MICROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nPainters are obliged to avail themselves of this peculiarity, and to\r\nmake allowances for the double vision. If they do not, the effect of the\r\npainting is flat, and it appears as if the artist had only used one eye.\r\n\r\nA good proof of this fact may be seen in Stereoscopic photographs,\r\nespecially of scenery. If each be viewed separately, it often appears\r\nquite unintelligible, but, when they are combined by the instrument,\r\nthey seem to spring into life as it were, and appear solid enough to be\r\ngrasped.\r\n\r\nNow, the Stereoscope is avowedly constructed on the same principle as\r\nthe double vision of the eye, so that when it applies itself to two\r\nphotographs of the same object which have been taken from different\r\npoints of view, it combines them, and gives them as solid an appearance\r\nas if they were realities.\r\n\r\nSo wonderfully close is the representation, that the idea of a place\r\nobtained by means of the combination of the photograph and Stereoscope\r\nis quite as vivid and correct as if it had been gained by actual\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the Stereoscope is now applied to the best microscopes,\r\nand its value is incalculable, especially when low powers are used,\r\n_i.e._ those of not less than half an inch focus. The real beauty of\r\nmany objects could never have been appreciated but for this discovery,\r\nnor their true form defined.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the illustration is shown the combining power of the\r\neyes. Supposing the right eye only to be brought to bear upon the little\r\ncylinder, only one side of it will be seen, and it looks nearly flat.\r\nThe same is the case with the left eye. But, when both eyes are used\r\ntogether, both sides of the cylinder are presented to the mind, and thus\r\nwe get the effect of solidity.\r\n\r\nThe Stereoscope is so formed, by means of lenses, that the two figures\r\nbecome combined into one, the rays of light being turned out of their\r\ncourse by the arrangement of the glasses.\r\n\r\nThe Stereoscope, however, although a useful assistant to the vision, is\r\nnot necessary. It is perfectly possible to combine the two figures\r\nwithout any stereoscope, and to do so merely by squinting, if we may so\r\ncall it, at the figures. The power of combination is gained with a very\r\nlittle practice, and in a short time the observer will be capable of\r\nproducing stereoscopic effects without needing a Stereoscope. This\r\nability is very useful when inspecting photographs in a shop-window. Of\r\ncourse the figures are not so much enlarged as they are with the\r\nstereoscope, but they are nevertheless quite as clear and well defined.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is an instrument called the Pseudoscope, which, as its name\r\nimports, gives a false idea as to the nature of the object which is\r\nviewed through it, converting hollow objects into solid, and _vice\r\nversâ_. The following description of its effect is given by\r\nWheatstone:--\r\n\r\n“When an observer looks with the pseudoscope at the interior of a cup or\r\nbasin, he not unfrequently sees it at first in its real form; but by\r\nprolonging his gaze he will perceive the conversion within a few\r\nminutes; and it is curious that, while this seems to take place quite\r\nsuddenly with some individuals, as if the basin were flexible, and were\r\nsuddenly turned inside out, it occurs more gradually with others, the\r\nconcavity slowly giving way to flatness, and the flatness progressively\r\nrising into convexity.\r\n\r\n“Not unfrequently, after the conversion has taken place, the natural\r\naspect of the object continues to intrude itself, sometimes suddenly,\r\nsometimes gradually, and for a longer or shorter interval, when the\r\nconverse will again succeed it--as if the new visual impression could\r\nnot at once counteract the previous results of recent experience. At\r\nlast, however, the mind seems to accept the conversion without further\r\nhesitation; and after this process has once been completely gone\r\nthrough, the observer, on recurring to the same object, will not find it\r\npossible to see it in any other than its converted form, unless the\r\ninterval should be long enough to have allowed him to forget its aspect.\r\n\r\n“Vagaries, however, sometimes occur in these experiments of which it is\r\ndifficult to give any certain explanation, but which would be probably\r\nfound referable to the same general principle, if we were acquainted\r\nwith all the conditions of its operation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MULTIPLYING-GLASS.\r\n\r\nStill more extraordinary examples of the combining power of vision\r\nare to be found in the eyes of spiders and insects, more especially\r\nwhen we compare them with the work of man. If we take a common\r\nMultiplying-glass, such as is shown in the figure, and look at a flower\r\nor other object through it, we see the object repeated as many times as\r\nthere are different foci of vision in the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EYES OF SPIDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MULTIPLYING-GLASS.]\r\n\r\nNow, taking for example the eyes of a Spider, it would be natural to\r\nsuppose that the same result would occur, especially as the foci of the\r\neyes point in different directions. The left-hand figure in the\r\nillustration represents the eight eyes of one of our common Spiders,\r\nbelonging to the genus _Clubiona_, which may be found in almost any\r\nouthouse, sitting in its curious web, and ready in a moment to run for\r\nsafety into its silken tunnel.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the foci of all the eyes are in different\r\ndirections, and so placed as to command a large radius. Observers have\r\nremarked that the eyes are placed in Spiders so as to suit their habits.\r\n“Those spiders,” writes Professor Owen, in his “Comparative Anatomy,”\r\n“which hide in tubes, or lurk in obscure retreats, either underground or\r\nin the holes or fissures of walls or rocks, from which they emerge only\r\nto seize a passing prey, have their eyes aggregated in a close group in\r\nthe middle of the forehead, as in the Bird-spider, the _Clotho_, &c.\r\n\r\n“The spiders which inhabit short tubes, terminated by a large web,\r\nexposed to the open air, have the eyes separated and more spread upon\r\nthe front of the cephalothorax.\r\n\r\n“Those spiders which rest in the centre of a free web, along which they\r\nfrequently traverse, have the eyes supported on slight prominences,\r\nwhich permit a greater divergence of their axis; this structure is well\r\nremarked in the genus _Thomisa_, the species of which live in ambuscade\r\nin flowers.\r\n\r\n“Lastly, the spiders called _Errantes_, or Wanderers, have their eyes\r\nstill more scattered, the lateral ones being placed at the margin of the\r\ncephalothorax.”\r\n\r\nYet, although each eye produces a separate image, it is clear that upon\r\nthe mind of the Spider only a single idea can be impressed, for that\r\notherwise all would be confusion. There must, therefore, be some\r\nmechanism in the structure of the eye, the nature of which we are not as\r\nyet able to understand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA STILL more remarkable instance of a natural Multiplying-glass may be\r\nfound in the eyes of many insects.\r\n\r\nThe form of multiplying-glass shown in the accompanying illustration is\r\nprobably familiar to most of my readers. It consists of a convex piece\r\nof glass, cut into a number of facets, and showing in each facet a\r\ndistinct and separate image of the object to which it is directed. Now,\r\nthe compound eyes of insects are constructed on much the same\r\nprinciple, except that the number of facets is infinitely more. Taking,\r\nfor example, the eyes of the Tortoise-shell Butterfly, we find that\r\nthere are about seventy thousand lenses or facets. Now, it is possible,\r\nwith care, to remove the eye from the insect, cleanse it, and arrange it\r\nin ä microscope in such a way that objects can be seen through it. When\r\nthis is done, a separate image is seen in each facet, just as is the\r\ncase with the Multiplying-glass, only, as the facets are very much more\r\nnumerous, the effect is proportionately more striking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSECT EYE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUMBLER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MULTIPLYING-GLASS.]\r\n\r\nThe reader may notice that the facets of the insect eye appear to be\r\nhexagons as perfect as those of the honey-comb. This appearance is\r\nprobably due to the fact that each eye is covered with a convex plate of\r\nglassy brightness and transparency, and that, when such objects are\r\nviewed from the front, they appear to have hexagonal instead of rounded\r\noutlines. A familiar example of this fact may be found in the glass\r\ntumblers which are ornamented with rounded projections on their surface.\r\nIf a photograph of one of these tumblers be taken, the resemblance to\r\nthe hexagonal markings of the insect eye is so close that the tumbler\r\nmight easily be taken for the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE WATER TELESCOPE.--IRIS OF THE EYE.--MAGIC LANTERN.--THE\r\nSPECTROSCOPE.--THE THAUMATROPE.\r\n\r\n     Limits to Sight in the Water.--Effect of a Ripple.--The Eyes under\r\n     Water.--The Water Telescope, its Structure and Mode of\r\n     Use.--Gyrinus, or Whirlwig-beetle, and its Double Set of Eyes.--The\r\n     Iris of the Eye, and its Double Set of Contractile\r\n     Fibres.--Cotterill’s Lock and its Structure.--The Magic Lantern and\r\n     its Principle.--Chinese Shadows.--Spectre of the Brocken.--An\r\n     Adventure in Wiltshire.--Effect of the Halo.--The\r\n     Spectroscope.--Its Structure explained.--A Star on fire.--Motes in\r\n     the Sunbeams.--Bessemer Steel made by aid of the\r\n     Spectroscope.--Absorption Bands.--Detection of Blood.--A Man’s Life\r\n     saved by the Spectroscope.--The Pocket Spectroscope.--The Rainbow,\r\n     Dewdrop, Soap-bubble, Opal, and Pearl.--The Thaumatrope.--Structure\r\n     of the Retina.--Complementary Colours.--The Zoetrope and\r\n     Chromatrope.--Wheel Animalcules and their Structure.--An Optical\r\n     Delusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has watched the movements of the various creatures which\r\nlive below the surface of the water is aware how entirely dependent he\r\nis on the unruffled character of that surface. No matter how clear the\r\nwater may be, the least ruffling of the surface will effectually shut\r\nout all sight:--\r\n\r\n    “But if a stone the gentle sea divide,\r\n     Swift rippling circles rush on every side,\r\n     And glimmering fragments of a broken sun,\r\n     Banks, trees, and skies in thick disorder run.”\r\n\r\nAnd there is an end of the observations. If, however, the eyes can\r\npenetrate below the surface, the ruffling is of little consequence, so\r\nlong as the water is clear. Consequently, whenever the top of the bank\r\nis sufficiently near the water, it is possible to continue the\r\nobservations by lying down, and immersing the head above the eyes. This\r\nplan, however, is not a very comfortable one, although I have often\r\nfollowed it on a windy day when the surface was too ruffled to permit of\r\nvision in any other way.\r\n\r\nStill, there is an instrument by which it is possible to counteract the\r\nruffle of the surface, and to see objects with tolerable plainness. This\r\nis called the Water Telescope, and it is of very simple construction.\r\nLike the ordinary telescope, it consists of a tube, but, instead of the\r\nconvex and concave lenses of that instrument, it has only a single glass\r\nat one end, and that glass is perfectly plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHIRLWIG-BEETLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nWhen used, the eye is applied to the open end, and the glazed end\r\nlowered into the water. The sight is then undisturbed by the ripple, and\r\nthe effect is the same as if the eyes themselves were lowered beneath\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nIt is much used in looking for shells, sea-urchins, and other creatures\r\nwhich live in the bed of the sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the insect world we have an example of a natural Water Telescope. I\r\ndo not say that the inventor of the Water Telescope took his idea from\r\nthe insect, but the reader will see that he might very well have done\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThere are sundry little beetles popularly called Whirlwigs or\r\nWhirligigs, and scientifically known by the name of _Gyrinus_. All these\r\nnames allude to the insect’s habit of whirling about on the surface of\r\nthe water, with a movement which seems ceaseless and untiring. Allusion\r\nhas already been made to the Whirlwigs on page 22.\r\n\r\nTheir object in their perpetual waltz is not so much amusement as food,\r\nwhich chiefly consists of the tiny insects which fall into the water.\r\nNow, in order to enable it to see both above and below the water, a\r\npeculiar structure is required. Generally the insects possess one pair\r\nof compound eyes, each group being set on the sides of the head. In the\r\nGyrinus, however, there are two sets of these eyes, one pair being on\r\nthe upper surface of the head, and the other on the lower surface. Thus,\r\nwhile it can use the upper pair for seeing objects which are out of the\r\nwater, the lower pair of eyes, which are submerged, act the part of the\r\nWater Telescope, and enable it to see objects that are below the\r\nsurface. Were it not for this precaution, even the ripples which it\r\nmakes by its own rapid progress would prevent it from seeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRIS OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRIS OF HUMAN EVE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTERILL’S LOCK.]\r\n\r\nI have often wondered, when contemplating the astonishing mechanism by\r\nwhich the Iris of the Eye is able to contract or enlarge the pupil\r\naccording to the amount of light, whether any similar mechanism would be\r\nused in Art. As anatomists know, the Iris is composed of two layers. One\r\nconsists of radiating fibres, which serve to enlarge the pupil, while\r\nthe other layer surrounds the latter, and by its elasticity serves to\r\ncontract it. As any one may see by looking in a mirror and shifting the\r\nlight, the pupil is perpetually changing its diameter, but always\r\nretaining its circular shape. A glance at the illustration will show the\r\ntwo layers, and aid the reader in understanding the mode in which they\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, while looking at the account given by Mr. J. Price of a\r\nlock invented by Mr. Cotterill, I saw at once that the inventor, whether\r\nconsciously or not, had followed the mechanism of the eye, as far as\r\nmetal could be expected to imitate animal fibre.\r\n\r\nIn the very centre of the lock there is a small circular opening,\r\nresembling the pupil of the eye, and serving to admit the key, just as\r\nthe pupil admits light. Around this pupil, if we may so call it, are\r\nranged some twenty thin steel slides which move in channels, up and down\r\nwhich they slide. Round the circumference of the lock are a\r\ncorresponding number of spiral springs, each of which presses on the\r\nbase of a slide, and forces it towards the centre.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now see that the radiating slides of the lock represent\r\nthe radiating fibres of the iris, and that the spiral springs represent\r\nthe circular fibres. Both perform the same office, the steel slides\r\nregulating the size of the aperture, and the spiral springs pressing\r\nthem all towards the centre. The key of the lock answers the same\r\npurpose as does light in the eye, which by its mysterious pressure\r\nenlarges or contracts the pupil.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to describe this very ingenious lock in detail,\r\nbut I may state that it has never been picked. Even Mr. Hobbs, who tried\r\nit for twenty-four hours, gave it up, and, when he saw the interior\r\nmechanism, said that if he had tried for a month he should have made no\r\nprogress. This is an unconscious testimony to the wisdom of following\r\nNature in Art.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC LANTERN.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the Magic Lantern, whether it may take the form\r\nof the mere child’s toy, be developed into Dissolving Views, or throw\r\nblack shadows on a curtain, in which case it is called by the name of\r\nChinese Shadows. In all these cases the principle is the same. First we\r\nhave a light behind the object whose reflection is to be seen. Next we\r\nhave the object itself, and lastly the surface upon which it is\r\nreflected. As to the variety of mirrors, lamps, and lenses which are\r\nused to produce different effects, we may put them aside as foreign to\r\nour present purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGIC LANTERN.]\r\n\r\nGenerally the object is reflected upon a white curtain or sheet, but\r\nsometimes, when a specially weird-like effect is needed, a cloud of\r\nthick smoke takes the place of the sheet, and upon it the reflection is\r\nshown, as seen in the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATURE has her Magic Lanterns as well as Art, and wonderful things they\r\nare sometimes, the well-known Brocken Spectre being an excellent\r\nexample. It is not, however, necessary to visit the Brocken in order to\r\nsee this apparition, for I have seen it in perfection in England.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when living in Wiltshire, I went before daybreak to the\r\ntop of a very high conical hill. The morning mist was so thick that I\r\ncould scarcely see my way up the hill. When I reached the summit, I\r\nstood there for some time, trying to see the landscape, but the mist was\r\nso thick that I could barely tell the points of the horizon by the\r\nbrighter look cast by the coming Day in the east.\r\n\r\nI was looking westward, when suddenly the sun rose behind me, and I saw\r\nthe Brocken Spectre as I have sketched it in the accompanying\r\nillustration. It was a gigantic shadow of myself, projected on the mist,\r\njust as a Magic Lantern projects the image on a sheet or a smoke-cloud.\r\nOf course my gestures were repeated, and it really looked almost awful\r\nto see this gigantic spectral figure set in the mist.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most extraordinary part of it was the enormous halo of\r\nrainbow colours round the head. No matter where I moved, the halo\r\nsurrounded the head of the image, its colours being comparatively bright\r\nnear the centre, and becoming gradually paler towards the circumference.\r\n\r\nAnother point about this natural Magic Lantern ought to be mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROCKEN SPECTRE.]\r\n\r\nWishing to show a friend the extraordinary sight of a Brocken Spectre, I\r\ntook him up the hill on a misty day like that which has been briefly\r\ndescribed. According to surmise, two spectres appeared instead of one,\r\nbut the halo was not doubled as well as the shadow. I could see my\r\nfriend’s shadow, and he could see mine. But, although the halo was as\r\nbright as before, each of us could only see it encircling his own head.\r\nWe stood as close to each other as we could, we moved apart as far as\r\nthe nearly conical top of the hill would allow, and in both cases each\r\nof us could only see his own halo.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may remember the wonderful spectre-scene drawn by Mr.\r\nWhymper, and viewed from the Matterhorn just after the accident which\r\nhad killed several of his companions in the ascent of the hitherto\r\nimpregnable peak. In the mist there suddenly appeared three vast dark\r\ncrosses enclosed in an oval. Considering the highly-strung nerves of the\r\nsurvivors, it was no wonder that they were all shaken by such an\r\nappearance, and that the guides were for a time too frightened to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTROSCOPE.\r\n\r\nNext we come to one of the most astonishing and beautiful optical\r\ninstruments ever made by the hand of man. It is called the Spectroscope,\r\nbecause it deals with a certain arrangement of rays which is called a\r\n“spectrum.” Many years ago Newton discovered the cause of the lovely\r\ncolours which deck the rainbow, and the fact that, by passing a ray of\r\nwhite light through a prism, it was decomposed into seven colours, which\r\ninvariably came in the following order--Red, Orange, Yellow, Green,\r\nBlue, Indigo, and Violet. He also discovered that, by looking at that\r\ncoloured band through another prism arranged in a different manner, the\r\ndecomposed rays were again brought together, and white light was the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nNewton had thrown the light on the prism through a round hole, but some\r\ntime afterwards Dr. Wollaston employed a narrow slit for the purpose,\r\nand then found that the spectrum was traversed by dark lines which never\r\nchanged their places. On these lines depend all the discoveries that\r\nhave been made by the aid of the Spectroscope. The chief of them are\r\ndesignated by the letters of the alphabet. (See page 300.)\r\n\r\nIt was soon found out that if burning gases were viewed with the\r\nSpectroscope, lines were still seen, but they were bright instead of\r\ndark, and that they invariably occupied the place of one or more of the\r\ndark lines shown by the spectrum of sunlight. Then it was discovered\r\nthat these burning gases absorbed or stopped out the light in the solar\r\nspectrum, and from that moment the science rapidly advanced.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the Spectroscope not only determines the metals which\r\nexist in the sun, but also those of the fixed stars. It even analyzes\r\nthe constitution of double stars, and shows the reason why one star\r\nshould be red and the other green.\r\n\r\nOne of the most astonishing discoveries in astronomy was due to the\r\nSpectroscope.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May, 1866, one of the stars in the Northern Crown\r\n(_Corona Borealis_) was seen to undergo a rapid change. It was\r\noriginally one of the tenth magnitude, but in a short time increased in\r\nsize and brilliancy until it nearly equalled Sirius, Capella, or Vega.\r\nIt remained bright for some time, and then rapidly faded until it\r\nresumed its former size.\r\n\r\nHow this change was effected we never should have known but for the\r\nSpectroscope. No sooner, however, was this instrument pointed at the\r\nstar than there appeared in the spectrum the three well-known\r\nlines--red, green, and violet--which denote burning hydrogen. There was\r\nno doubt on the matter, and the Spectroscope showed us that we were\r\nwitnessing a conflagration the like of which was never seen or scarcely\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAINBOW.]\r\n\r\nSupposing our sun, which is known to be one of the stars, and about\r\nwhich there are vast volumes of hydrogen gas, were to blaze out in a\r\nsimilar manner, the result would be that the whole of the planets would\r\nbe consumed in a few seconds, and converted into gases. In an instant\r\nevery living thing would be swept off the surface of the earth by this\r\nfearful heat, and, as Mr. Roscoe says, “our solid globe would be\r\ndissipated in vapour almost as soon as drops of water in a furnace.” So,\r\nas Mr. Huggins observes, the old nursery rhyme,--\r\n\r\n    “Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\r\n     How I wonder what you are,”--\r\n\r\nis no longer tenable, for we really do know the composition of the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nThe Spectroscope not only tells us the substance of which the sun and\r\nthe most distant stars are made, but gives us the same information about\r\nthe “gay motes that people the sunbeam.” It tells us that they are\r\ncommon salt in very minute particles. They have been dashed into the air\r\nby the winds as spray, and then dispersed over the whole globe. This is\r\none reason why we have so much salt in our bodies, and why the blood and\r\nthe tears are so salt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is also applied to the arts. The well-known Bessemer process consists\r\nin pouring melted iron into a peculiarly shaped vessel called a\r\n“converter,” and blowing air through it for the purpose of burning out\r\nthe carbon. From the mouth of the converter issues a volume of\r\nmagnificent flames, and at a certain moment the skilled workman who\r\ndirects the process inverts the vessel and pours out the steel. A very\r\nfew seconds too soon or too late would spoil the whole of the metal, in\r\nthe former case it being simply brittle cast-iron; and, in the second,\r\nbecoming so thick that it could not be poured out.\r\n\r\nOnly a few workmen could judge rightly the exact point at which to shut\r\noff the air-blast. They watched the flame, and by some change in it, too\r\nslight to be noticed by any except experienced eyes, knew the moment\r\nwhen the iron was converted into steel.\r\n\r\nSuch men could, of course, demand any wages they liked, and, by\r\nstriking, stop the whole works. The Spectroscope, however, performed\r\nthis delicate discrimination far better than the best workman. When\r\ndirected to the flame, the bright lines indicating carbon are seen in\r\nthe spectrum. When the blast has continued for some twenty minutes, the\r\ncarbon lines suddenly disappear, showing that the carbon has been burned\r\nout, and giving to the workman the signal to shut off the air-blast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER discovery was, that liquids gave dark lines, technically termed\r\nabsorption bands, of different widths and in different parts of the\r\nspectrum. Even liquids which had no perceptible colour threw bands as\r\nbold as those which were coloured, while coloured liquids threw totally\r\ndifferent bands, irrespectively of their own colour.\r\n\r\nFor example, the green colouring matter of leaves, called chlorophyll,\r\nthrows a single broad band on the extreme left--_i.e._ across the red\r\npart of the spectrum--so far back, indeed, that it is not easily seen at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThen, suppose that we make some pale solutions of red substances, such\r\nas carmine, magenta dye, port wine, logwood, permanganate of potash, and\r\nblood, it is possible to have them so exactly resembling each other that\r\nnot even the microscope can discriminate between them; yet the\r\nSpectroscope instantly detects the colouring matter of each solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECTRUM OF SUNLIGHT, OR SOLAR SPECTRUM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECTRUM OF BLOOD.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument is, therefore, invaluable in detecting adulterations of\r\nwine. For example, supposing that red wine is suspected of owing its\r\nredness to logwood, and not to the genuine grape, a drop is mixed with\r\nwater and viewed through the Spectroscope, which instantly tells whether\r\nthe colouring matter is grape or logwood. And as, by photography, the\r\nspectrum can be exactly copied, an indelible record is procured of the\r\ntrue nature of the object.\r\n\r\nSo marvellously delicate is the instrument with regard to blood, that it\r\ndetects the thousandth part of a grain of colouring matter in a\r\nblood-stain.\r\n\r\nIf upon the spectrum were printed the word BLOOD in the largest and\r\nblackest of capitals, it could not be more legible to an ordinary reader\r\nthan are the two blood-bands to the eye of a spectroscopist. There is\r\nnothing like them in nature, and whether it be by association of ideas,\r\nor by absolute fact, these two bars have a strangely menacing look about\r\nthem. Not only that, but if the blood should be that of a person\r\nsuffocated with carbonic acid gas, the Spectroscope will say so.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a man owed his life to the Spectroscope. A mysterious\r\nmurder had been committed, and the police had arrested a man who was\r\nfound near the spot. He could give no intelligible account of himself,\r\nand the sleeves of his coat and a part of his waistcoat were deeply\r\nstained with a red substance just like clotted blood. A piece of each\r\ngarment was cut off and given to a well-known spectroscopist, who tried\r\nthe red matter in the instrument, and at once declared it not to be\r\nblood. What it was he had not time to ascertain, so he sent it to a\r\nbrother in science, who, after examination, pronounced it to be red gum.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the man, who had been intoxicated when arrested, stated that\r\nhe had been to see a friend who was a journeyman hatter. It was then\r\nfound that he had been leaning on the workman’s board, and so had\r\ncarried off some of the gummastic with which hats are stiffened. Had it\r\nnot been for the infallible Spectroscope, the man might have lost his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the Spectroscope is the elephant’s trunk of optics,\r\nequally fitted for the greatest and smallest, the farthest and nearest,\r\nof objects. It is equally at home in earth and sky. When attached to the\r\ntelescope, it reveals the constituents of the stars, and, when affixed\r\nto the microscope, it shows us the colouring matter of a green leaf. It\r\nproduces the best steel, and detects adulteration in wine. And, lastly,\r\nas we have seen, it turns lawyer, and settles the evidence by which the\r\nlife of a man is lost or saved. It can determine the purity of the\r\nsmallest coinage, and tell us why a star changes in magnitude.\r\n\r\nYet all these wondrous revelations are made by a few prisms and a\r\nmagnifying-glass. I possess a Spectroscope, made and presented to me by\r\nMr. J. Browning, the celebrated optician. This astonishing instrument is\r\nonly three inches long, and half an inch in diameter, so that it can be\r\ncarried in the waistcoat pocket. I always keep mine in a finger of a\r\nwhite kid glove, which is amply sufficient for it. Yet it gives the\r\nspectrum of the sun with its principal lines, will detect the fraudulent\r\nwine merchant, and could have decided whether the accused man should be\r\nacquitted or hanged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMARVELLOUS and mighty as is this engine, it lay concealed in Nature ever\r\nsince the sun’s rays shone upon earth and a drop of water existed. The\r\nRainbow is nothing but a vast spectrum, a transverse slice of which\r\nwould be a good representation of the coloured band which is shown in\r\nthe instrument. It is prefigured in the ever-shifting rainbows of the\r\nwater-fall and fountain, which latter may even be seen in the fountains\r\nof Trafalgar Square, while at the Crystal Palace their beauty has long\r\nbeen noticed.\r\n\r\nThere is not a dewdrop which is not a miniature Spectroscope, as it\r\nglitters with its wondrous iridescence in the rays of the rising sun;\r\nthere is not an opal with its shifting hues, nor the splendour of the\r\nsoap-bubble, nor the nacre of the common river mussel or the ormer\r\nshell, which does not owe its beauty to the same principles which govern\r\nthe Spectroscope. Every green leaf, and blue or pink or yellow petal,\r\nevery varying tint of the mackerel sky, every blaze of sunset and\r\nbluegrey of sunrise, owes its beauty to those wondrous laws of light\r\nwhich had been hidden for so many centuries, until they were unveiled by\r\nthe simple prism of the Spectroscope. As in so many instances, the\r\nrevelation lay concealed until the coming of the revealer, whose\r\ninspired hand raised the dark veil of centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THAUMATROPE.\r\n\r\nMiddle-aged persons will recollect that since the days of their\r\nchildhood a great variety of optical apparatus has been invented ending\r\nin the word “trope.” This is a Greek word, signifying to turn, and is\r\ngiven to the instruments because they revolve.\r\n\r\nAll these toys--and they may some day become more than toys--depend on a\r\ncurious property of the human eye. The reader will remember that in the\r\ndescription of the human eye, as compared with the camera obscura as\r\napplied to photography, it was mentioned that the image was thrown from\r\nthe front to the back, and in the one case was received on a naturally\r\nsensitive membrane, and in the other on a film rendered artificially\r\nsensitive by chemical means. This membrane is called the “retina,”\r\nbecause it not only receives the impression, but retains it for some\r\nlittle time after the object is removed. It has been calculated that the\r\nduration of the image is about the eighth part of a second.\r\n\r\nThus the eyelids are perpetually and unconsciously closing and opening\r\nwith a rapid movement, popularly called “winking.” This movement is for\r\nthe purpose of cleansing the eyeball, and, were it not for the\r\nimage-retaining power of the retina, we should pass a considerable part\r\nof our time in absolute darkness. As it is, the impression of external\r\nobjects on the retina lasts longer than the time occupied in winking,\r\nand, in consequence, we are not conscious that any interval of darkness\r\nhas elapsed.\r\n\r\nAgain, when we have been looking steadfastly at an object, and then move\r\nour eyes, the image of that object is seen in the new focus; and it is\r\nworthy of notice that such object is always seen in its “complementary”\r\ncolour. For example, if we have been looking at a scarlet spot, and\r\nsuddenly move our eyes, we shall see a spot exactly similar in size and\r\nshape, but of green.\r\n\r\nI well remember that when I was a boy I was reading with almost feverish\r\nanxiety the green handbill of a travelling circus, to which I hoped that\r\nI might be allowed to attend. Having finished it, I asked for some\r\nnote-paper, for the purpose of putting my request in writing, but, to my\r\nastonishment, mixed, perhaps, with a little irritation, all the paper\r\nsupplied to me was of a bright pink. For a time no arguments could\r\nconvince me that the paper was really white, until by degrees the pink\r\nhue became paler and paler, and the paper assumed its normal whiteness.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that the eye had become saturated with the green--_i.e._\r\nthe blue and yellow rays--and could see nothing but their complementary\r\ncolour, which was pink.\r\n\r\nA good example of this property may be found in a lighted stick, which,\r\nif rapidly whirled round, appears to form a continuous circle of fire.\r\nThe reason of this is, that the impression made on the retina by the\r\nfiery point does not cease until the stick has again come round in its\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThen there are those well-known chromatic tops, in which are inserted\r\npieces of bent wire. When the top is spun these pieces of wire assume\r\nexactly the appearance of transparent jugs, vases, glasses, and similar\r\narticles. A very pretty illustration of this principle is given by a\r\nlittle machine, which is made to revolve rapidly by means of a\r\nmultiplying wheel.\r\n\r\nUpon its surface are fixed little pins, with polished globular steel\r\nheads, and, when the handle is turned, these heads form the most\r\nbeautiful and intricate figures with exact accuracy.\r\n\r\nAnother toy, called the Thaumatrope, or Wonder-turner, is equally\r\ningenious and beautiful, and is sufficiently simple to be made by any\r\none with a slight knowledge of drawing. A disc of white cardboard is\r\ncut, and upon each side of it is portrayed some object. If the disc be\r\ncaused to revolve rapidly, these two subjects will be seen at the same\r\ntime, the image of each being held on the retina long enough to allow\r\nthe other to take its place.\r\n\r\nSome very beautiful combinations may be made by means of this\r\ninstrument. For example, a horse may be on one side, and a man on the\r\nother, and, by spinning the disc, the man will be seen mounted on the\r\nhorse. Then we may have a boat on one side, and a rower with his oars on\r\nthe other. Similarly a mouse can be put into a trap, or a bird into a\r\ncage.\r\n\r\nThe reader must remember that these subjects must be drawn as if they\r\nwere upside down with regard to each other, so that the man who is to\r\nride the horse is drawn as if he were standing on his head, and the\r\nmouse which is to enter the trap looks as if it were lying on its back.\r\n\r\nThe most simple manner of spinning the disc is by means of two threads,\r\neach being inserted near the edge of the disc, and exactly opposite each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA very ingenious modification of the Thaumatrope is made by inserting at\r\none side of the disc two strings, of which one is elastic. It is\r\nevident, then, that by lengthening or shortening the elastic string, the\r\naxis can be changed, and the objects on the opposite sides placed in\r\npositions relatively different from each other. Thus the jockey may be\r\nmade to jump on and off his horse, the bird to go in and out of its\r\ncage, the mouse to enter the trap, and so on. This simple invention\r\nallows of infinite combinations, so that a tree may be made to sprout, a\r\nman to move his limbs, and a bird to flap its wings. It was invented, I\r\nbelieve, by Dr. Paris, author of “Philosophy in Sport made Science in\r\nEarnest.”\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration are seen three figures, each\r\nrepresenting a means of obtaining an ocular delusion through the\r\nprinciple of which we are now treating.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure is called the Zoetrope, or Wheel of Life. As the reader\r\nmay see, it consists of a hollow cylinder, revolving on a centre, and\r\nhaving within it a series of figures. When the wheel revolves, and the\r\nfigures are viewed through the slits, each figure seems to be in\r\nlifelike motion, whence the name of Zoetrope. In the present case the\r\nfigures are those of boys jumping over posts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nWHEEL ANIMALCULE.\r\n\r\nPHANTASMASCOPE.\r\n\r\nCHROMATROPE.\r\n\r\nZOETROPE.]\r\n\r\nThe mode in which this effect is produced is as follows:--Suppose that a\r\nboy were really to jump over a post, he would go through a series of\r\nmotions, and his body be placed in a certain series of positions, before\r\nhe cleared the post. Supposing, then, that several points were chosen in\r\nhis course, and his body drawn as it would appear at these points, and\r\nthe drawings placed in their proper order in the Zoetrope, it is evident\r\nthat the figures must appear in movement. Before the retina loses the\r\nimage of the boy standing in front of the post, it takes in that of the\r\nboy stooping, with his hands on the top of the post, and so on until he\r\nhas reached the ground on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of producing the same effect, called the Phantasmascope, is\r\nseen above the zoetrope. In this case the images are placed on the\r\ninside of the disc, which is held opposite a mirror, and the figures\r\nviewed through the slits.\r\n\r\nThe last of these figures is the rather complicated one, like the back\r\nof an “engine-turned” watch. This is called the Chromatrope, or Wheel of\r\nColour, and is always a favourite object in a magic lantern. It consists\r\nof two circular plates of glass, one upon the other, and painted in\r\nvariously coloured curved lines, as seen in the illustration. When the\r\nimage is thrown upon a screen, and the glass plates turned in opposite\r\ndirections, a most singular and beautiful effect is produced. The lines,\r\nunless the eye follows them very closely, disappear, and torrents of\r\ncoloured spots seem to pour from the centre to the circumference, or\r\n_vice versâ_, according to the direction in which the glass wheels are\r\nturned. So perfect is the illusion, that it is almost impossible to\r\nbelieve that the movement is only circular, and not spiral.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we will pass from Art to Nature. The figure on the left hand of the\r\nsame illustration represents part of one of the Wheel Animalcules, so\r\ncalled because they look exactly as if the fore-part of their bodies\r\nwere furnished with two delicate wheels, running rapidly round, and\r\nevidently moving or stopping at the pleasure of the owner.\r\n\r\nSoon after the powers of the microscope became known, these\r\nWheel-bearers were discovered, and for a long time they were thought to\r\nhave a pair of veritable revolving wheels upon their heads. They were\r\nnaturally held in high estimation, as, although almost every kind of\r\nlever can be found in the animal world, a revolving wheel had never been\r\nseen. However, as the defining powers of the microscope improved, the\r\nso-called wheels were found not to be wheels at all, but stationary\r\norgans, and that their apparent revolution was nothing but an optical\r\ndelusion.\r\n\r\nThe wheels are, in fact, two discs, around the edges of which are set\r\ncertain hair-like appendages, called “cilia,” from a Latin word\r\nsignifying the eyelashes. Each of the cilia has an independent motion of\r\nits own, and, as they bend in rapid and regular succession, they produce\r\nan effect on the eye similar to that of a revolving body. As for the\r\nanimal itself, they produce a double effect, either acting as paddles,\r\nand forcing the animal through the water, or, when it is affixed to some\r\nobject, causing a current which drives into its mouth the minute beings\r\non which it feeds.\r\n\r\nThe particular species of Wheel-hearer whose mouth is here shown is\r\ncalled scientifically _Limnias ceratophylli_. It derives the latter name\r\nfrom the fact that it is mostly found on the submerged stems and leaves\r\nof the Hornwort (_Ceratophyllum_), which is very common in ponds and\r\nslow streams. The creature is, however, to be found on the water-growing\r\nplants, and Mr. Gosse, in his “Evenings with the Microscope,” gives a\r\nvery full and graphic account of itself and its habits.\r\n\r\nHe specially mentions the use of the wheels, and, by dissolving a little\r\ncarmine in the water, had the pleasure of seeing the coloured granules\r\nswept into the mouth by the current caused by the cilia through the\r\njaws, and so into the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE MAN AND HIS NEEDS.--EARTHENWARE.--BALL-AND-SOCKET\r\nJOINT.--TOGGLE OR KNEE JOINT.\r\n\r\n     Contrast between Savagery and Civilisation.--Manufacture of\r\n     Weapons.--Earthenware of Art.--Sun-baked Vessels.--Earthenware of\r\n     Nature.--Nest of Pied Grallina.--Analogy with the Babylonish\r\n     Brick.--Nest of the Oven-bird.--A partitioned Vessel.--Necked\r\n     earthenware Vessels.--Nests of Eumenes, Trypoxylon, and\r\n     Pelopœus.--Proof of Reason in Insects.--The Ball-and-socket\r\n     Joint.--“Bull’s-eye” of Microscope.--The human\r\n     Thigh-bone.--Vertebræ of the Serpents and their Structure.--The\r\n     Sea-urchin and its Spines.--Legs and Antennæ of Insects.--The\r\n     Toggle or Knee Joint, and its Use in the Arts.--The hand\r\n     Printing-press and the Toggle-joint.--The human Leg and Arm.--Power\r\n     of the natural Toggle-joint.--Fencing and Boxing.--Heads of\r\n     Carriages.--“Bowsing” of Ropes.--Leaf-rolling Caterpillars.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the primitive ages of Man the aids to civilisation were very few and\r\nvery rude. Some of them, especially those which relate to hunting and\r\nwar, have already been mentioned, and we now have to deal with some of\r\nthose which bear upon domestic life.\r\n\r\nHere we are in some little difficulty, for it is not very easy to draw\r\nthe line where domestic life begins, or the mode in which it shall be\r\ndefined. We may at all events connect domestic life with a residence of\r\nsome sort, and may, in consequence, neglect all such primitive savages\r\nas need no domestic implements.\r\n\r\nSuch, for example, are the few surviving Bosjesmans of Southern Africa,\r\nnot one of whom ever made a tool or an implement, or looked beyond the\r\npresent day. The genuine Bosjesman can make a bow and poison his arrows,\r\nand he can light a fire; but there his civilisation ends. He cannot look\r\nbeyond the present hour, he has not the faintest notion of making a\r\nprovision for the future, nor did his wildest imagination ever compass\r\nthe idea of a pot or a pan.\r\n\r\nHe kills his prey, and, if hunger be very pressing, he will eat it at\r\nonce without waiting for the tedious ceremony of cooking; or at the best\r\nwill just throw the meat upon the fire, tear it to pieces with his\r\nteeth, and swallow it when it is nothing but a mass of bleeding flesh,\r\ncharred on the outside, and absolutely raw within. The Bosjesman has not\r\neven a tent which he can call his own, any bush or hole in the ground\r\nanswering for a house as long as he wants it, and then being exchanged\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\nAs far as we know, the only trace of civilisation in the Bosjesman is\r\nhis manufacture of weapons, and even his bow and arrows are of the\r\nrudest and clumsiest forms. Nor is it likely that he will ever advance\r\nany further; for, as is the wont of all savage tribes, he is\r\ndisappearing fast before the presence of superior races, and will\r\nshortly be as extinct as the Tasmanians, the last of whom died only a\r\nfew years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHENWARE.\r\n\r\nThe advent of real civilisation seems to depend largely upon the\r\nconstruction, not of weapons, but utensils, and the most useful of these\r\nare intended either for the preparation or the preservation of food.\r\nThat such vessels should be made of earth is evident enough, and it is\r\nworthy of remark that the rude earthenware pot of the naked savage and\r\nthe delicate china of Sèvres should both be products of the earth, and\r\nyet be examples of the opposite ends of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe most primitive earthenware vessels were simply baked in the rays of\r\nthe sun, the use of fire for hardening them being of later date. Rude\r\nand simple as they are, some of these vessels possess tolerable\r\nstrength, and can answer every purpose for which they are intended. I\r\npossess several pots made by the aborigines of the Essequibo district.\r\nThey are very thick and heavy in proportion to their dimensions, and are\r\nstill so fragile that I have been obliged to bind them with string\r\nwhenever they are moved.\r\n\r\nSimple as they are, however, they are pleasing to the eye, chiefly, I\r\npresume, because they are made for a definite office, and fulfil it,\r\nand have no pretence about them. Then, as they are moulded by hand\r\nalone, without any assistance from machinery of any kind, even a wheel,\r\nthe individuality of the maker is stamped upon them, and no two are\r\nexactly alike either in form, colour, or ornament. A couple of these\r\nrude vases are to be seen on the right hand of the accompanying\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the same illustration are shown two examples of\r\nearthenware vessels made by birds, which are nearly, if not quite, as\r\ngood as those made by the hands of civilised man.\r\n\r\nThe upper figure represents the nest of the Pied Grallina (_Grallina\r\nAustralis_), a bird which, as its specific name implies, is a native of\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNEST OF PIED GRALLINA.\r\n\r\nNEST OF OVEN-BIRD.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE EARTHENWARE.]\r\n\r\nThis nest is formed chiefly of clay, but a quantity of dried grass is\r\nalways mixed with it, and serves to bind it together. If one of these\r\nnests be broken up, and compared with the bricks of which ancient\r\nBabylon was built, it will be found that they are almost identical in\r\nmaterial, and that both are merely baked in the sun. In form it so\r\nclosely resembles an Essequibo jar in my possession, that if it were\r\nremoved from the branch, and similarly coloured, it would not be easy to\r\ndistinguish the one from the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW this is the nest of the Oven-bird of South America (_Furnarius\r\nfuliginosus_), a bird allied to our common creeper. The drawing was\r\ntaken from a specimen in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nLike the nest of the Grallina, it is placed upon some horizontal bough,\r\nand fixed so firmly that it cannot fall except by being broken to\r\npieces. Not being afraid of man, the Oven-bird often chooses a beam in\r\nsome outhouse for a resting-place, and has been known to build even on\r\nthe top of palings. As may be seen by reference to the illustration, the\r\nnest is a very conspicuous one, and concealment is almost impossible.\r\n\r\nAs in the Grallina nest, the material is remarkably hard and firm, as\r\nindeed is necessary, to allow it to withstand the effects of the\r\nrain-torrents which fall during the wet seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious analogy in this nest with many articles of\r\nearthenware. Not only among ourselves, but among uncivilised races,\r\nearthenware vessels are constructed with partitions, so as to divide one\r\nportion from another. If one of these nests be cut open, it will be\r\nfound to have a sort of partition wall across the interior, rising\r\nnearly to the top of the dome, and so dividing it into two parts. The\r\nwall also answers another purpose--_i.e._ that of strengthening the\r\nentire structure. Within the inner chamber is the real nest, which is\r\nlined with a thick layer of feathers, the outer chamber being bare, and,\r\nas it is thought, being occupied by the male.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to pottery of a more elaborate shape. Both in the Grallina\r\nnest and the earthen pot of the Essequibo Indian we have a vessel with a\r\nmouth nearly as wide as its greatest diameter, and with a lip which is\r\nvery slightly turned over. There are, however, many varieties of pottery\r\nin which the neck is narrow and long, and the lip is boldly formed. Some\r\nexamples of this form are given on the right hand of the accompanying\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand are shown some nests of a solitary wasp belonging to\r\nthe genus Eumenes. It is a British insect, but seems to have been little\r\nnoticed, except by professed entomologists.\r\n\r\nIt especially haunts heather, and affixes to the stems of the plant its\r\nlittle globular nests, which are made of mud, and shaped as seen in the\r\nillustration. Perhaps some of my readers may have seen the “Napier\r\nCoffee Machine,” which draws the coffee into a glass globe furnished\r\nwith a short neck. The globe is shaped exactly like the nest of our\r\nEumenes, and, when I first saw one, I could not remember why its shape\r\nwas so familiar to me.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with the birds’ nests which have been mentioned, the mud\r\nof which the walls are built is of a most tenacious character, and, when\r\ndried in the sun, can resist the heaviest rain. The cells are intended\r\nas rearing-places for the young, only a single egg being placed in each\r\ncell, which is then stocked with small caterpillars by way of food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NESTS OF EUMENES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT NECKED POTTERY.]\r\n\r\nThere is a South American insect also belonging to the solitary wasps,\r\nand remarkable for building a round nest exactly similar in material,\r\nand nearly identical in shape, with that of the Eumenes. Its scientific\r\ntitle is _Trypoxylon aurifrons_. The nest of this insect has a much\r\nwider mouth than that of the Eumenes, and exactly resembles the upper\r\nleft-hand jar in the illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER South American solitary wasp, belonging to the genus\r\nPelopœus, makes nests of similar material, but nearly cylindrical in\r\nshape instead of globular. The nest is built up of successive rings of\r\nmoistened and well-kneaded clay, exactly as human houses are built by\r\nbricklayers. Indeed, the process of making a Pelopœus’ nest has been\r\nhappily compared to that of building a circular chimney.\r\n\r\nI may as well mention here that the name Pelopœus is formed from a\r\nGreek word signifying mud, and that the entire word may be translated as\r\n“mud-worker.”\r\n\r\nAs a proof that these insects possess reason as well as instinct, Mr.\r\nGosse mentions that one of them, instead of making her nest for herself,\r\nutilised an empty bottle, and, after storing it with spiders, stopped up\r\nthe mouth with clay. Finding, after an absence of a few days, that the\r\nnest had been disturbed, she removed the spiders, inserted a fresh\r\nsupply, and then closed the mouth as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALL-AND-SOCKET JOINT.\r\n\r\nWe will now see how some of the most useful mechanical inventions have\r\nhad their prototypes in Nature.\r\n\r\nThere is, for example, the well-known “Ball-and-socket joint,” without\r\nwhich many of our instruments, especially those devoted to optical\r\npurposes, would be impracticable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIP-JOINT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINES OF SEA-URCHIN. VERTEBRÆ OF SNAKE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALL-AND-SOCKET JOINT OF MICROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe figure on the right hand of the illustration represents the\r\n“bull’s-eye” of my own microscope. It will be seen that there is a ball\r\nhalf sunk in a cup, so that it can be turned in any direction. In point\r\nof fact, the upper part of the ball is nearly concealed by another cup,\r\nbut, in order to show the structure, the upper cup has been removed. Who\r\nwas the inventor of the ball-and-socket joint I do not know, but I have\r\nlittle doubt that he must have had in his mind many natural examples of\r\nthis joint, three of which are represented in the illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand are seen the upper part of the human thigh-bone and\r\nthat part of the hip-bone into which it fits.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see that at its upper end the bone takes rather a sharp\r\nturn, and is then modified into a ball. This ball fits into a\r\ncorresponding socket, technically named the “acetabulum,” and is thereby\r\nendowed with freedom of motion in almost every direction. Generally we\r\ndo not practise our limbs sufficiently to develop that full freedom, but\r\nthose who have seen any good professional acrobats must have been struck\r\nwith the wonderful mobility of which the human body is capable.\r\n\r\nThe socket is not a deep one, but dislocation of the hip is exceedingly\r\nrare, the bone being held in its place by three powers. The first is due\r\nto a short ligament, which, however, does not always exist, but, when it\r\nis present, is useful in retaining the bone in its place. Then there is\r\nthe contractile power of the thigh muscles, which are always forcing the\r\nball into the socket. Lastly, there is the pressure of the atmosphere, a\r\nforce which is seldom taken into consideration, but which has great\r\ninfluence on many parts of the human frame. This part of the subject\r\nwill be resumed when we come to treat of Atmospheric Pressure.\r\n\r\nThe arms are jointed to the shoulder-blades in a very similar manner,\r\nthe upper arm-bone, or “humerus,” being furnished with a rounded end,\r\nand fitting into a cup-like cavity in the shoulder-blade, or “scapula.”\r\nThis formation can easily be seen by separating the different bones of a\r\nshoulder of mutton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAT the bottom of the illustration are given two vertebræ of a snake,\r\nseparated in order to show their structure. It will be seen that each\r\njoint has a ball in front and a socket behind, thus giving the creature\r\nthat wonderful flexibility which is quite proverbial, and without which\r\nit could not seize its prey.\r\n\r\nThe following eloquent passage is taken from Professor Owen’s work\r\nentitled “The Skeleton and the Teeth:”--\r\n\r\n“Serpents have been regarded as animals degraded from a higher type, but\r\ntheir whole organization, and especially their bony structure,\r\ndemonstrate that their parts are as exquisitely adjusted to the form of\r\ntheir whole, and to their habits and sphere of life, as is the\r\norganization of any animal which we call superior to them.\r\n\r\n“It is true that the serpent has no limbs, yet it can outclimb the\r\nmonkey, outswim the fish, outleap the Jerboa, and, suddenly loosening\r\nthe coils of its crouching spiral, it can spring into the air and seize\r\nthe bird upon the wing: all these creatures have been observed to fall\r\nits prey.\r\n\r\n“The serpent has neither hands nor talons, yet it can outwrestle the\r\nathlete, and crush the tiger in the embrace of its ponderous overlapping\r\nfolds. Instead of licking up its food as it glides along, the serpent\r\nuplifts its crushed prey, and presents it, grasped in the death-coil as\r\nin hand, to its slimy, gaping mouth.\r\n\r\n“It is truly wonderful to see the work of hands, feet, and fins\r\nperformed by a modification of the vertebral column--by a multiplication\r\nof its segments with mobility of its ribs. But the vertebræ are\r\nespecially modified, as we have seen, to compensate, by the strength of\r\ntheir numerous articulations, for the weakness of their manifold\r\nrepetition, and the consequent elongation of the slender column.\r\n\r\n“As serpents move chiefly on the surface of the earth, their danger is\r\ngreatest from pressure and blows from above; all the joints are\r\nfashioned accordingly to resist yielding, and sustain pressure in a\r\nvertical direction; there is no natural undulation of the body upwards\r\nand downwards--it is permitted only from side to side. So closely and\r\ncompactly do the ten pairs of joints between each of the two hundred or\r\nthree hundred vertebræ fit together, that even in the relaxed and dead\r\nstate the body cannot be twisted except in a series of side coils.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE upper right-hand figure represents a portion of the shell of an\r\nEchinus, or Sea-urchin, together with two of the spikes.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that in the description of the Heart-urchin,\r\nand the mode in which it dug its way into the sand, the peculiar\r\nmobility of the spines was mentioned. How that mobility is produced we\r\nshall now see.\r\n\r\nIf a living Sea-urchin can be procured, and placed in a glass vessel\r\nfilled with sea-water, it will at once be seen that its surface is\r\nthickly covered with spines. In some species these spines are as thick\r\nas ordinary drawing pencils; but in most of those which are found on our\r\nshores they are very slight, and scarcely longer than darning-needles.\r\nThey are in almost perpetual motion, and generally have a sort of\r\nrevolving movement, the base being the pivot.\r\n\r\nNow, if we take a dried shell of the Sea-urchin, we shall find that the\r\nspines will come off with a touch, and, indeed, to preserve one with all\r\nthe spines complete is a most difficult business. Let us, therefore,\r\npull one from its attachment, and examine its base. This will be found\r\nto be swollen into a cup-like form, as seen in the illustration; and, if\r\nwe look at the spot whence it came, we shall see that there is a little,\r\nrounded, polished prominence, exactly fitting into the cup, just as the\r\nball of the human thigh-bone fits into the acetabulum. It has also its\r\nligament to keep it in its place, and its same set of muscles that move\r\nit, and is altogether a most wonderful piece of mechanism. There are in\r\nsome species of Echinus about four thousand of these spines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE legs of an insect afford excellent examples of the ball-and-socket\r\nprinciple, the socket being on the body, and the ball on the base of the\r\nleg. Some of our largest insects--such, for example, as the common\r\nStag-beetle--exhibit this principle very well. I have now before me a\r\nStag-beetle which has been dead for many years, and is quite dry and\r\nhard. Yet I can rotate the legs almost as freely as if the beetle had\r\nbeen just killed, so easily do the joints work. Even the antennæ, which\r\nare affixed to the head by a similar joint, move about by their own\r\nweight on merely changing the position of the insect.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the many natural examples of the Ball-and-socket\r\njoint, but they are sufficient for our purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOGGLE OR KNEE JOINT.\r\n\r\nAnother most useful invention now comes before us, called the\r\nToggle-joint, or Knee-joint, the latter name being given to it on\r\naccount of its manifest resemblance to the action of the human knee.\r\n\r\nThis joint is shown in the illustration. It consists of two levers,\r\njointed together at one end, and having the other ends jointed to the\r\nobjects which are to be pressed asunder. It will be seen that if the\r\ncentre of the Toggle be pushed or pulled in the direction of the arrow,\r\nso as to straighten the levers, the amount of pressure upon them is\r\nenormous. Such an apparatus as this combines simplicity and power in a\r\nwonderful manner, and is greatly used in machinery, especially in\r\npresses, where the force is required to be great, but not of long\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary two-foot rule, when bent, affords a good example of the\r\nToggle-joint, and will exert a wonderful amount of force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSTRAIGHTENED\r\nTOGGLES.\r\n\r\nFENCERS.\r\n\r\nBENT\r\nTOGGLES.\r\n\r\nPRINTING-PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents one of the common printing-presses that are\r\nworked by hand. When the workman draws the handle horizontally, he\r\ncauses the two portions of the Toggle to approach a straight line. The\r\nupper half of the Toggle being jointed to the fixed beam above, and the\r\nother half to the movable plate or “platen” below, it is evident that\r\nthe latter will be pressed downwards with enormous force. Indeed, so\r\ngreat is the power of this instrument, that a man of moderate strength\r\ncan exert a pressure of many tons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now proceed from Art to Nature, and take first the human knee, being\r\nthe joint from which this piece of mechanism has derived one of its\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will look at the figure of the fencers, he will see that\r\nthe arm and leg are both Toggle-joints. In the one who is standing on\r\nthe defence they are bent, and in the other, who has just made a longe,\r\nthe Toggles of the right arm and left leg are straightened. It is by the\r\nstraightening of these joints, and not by the action of stabbing, that\r\nthe rapidity and force of a thrust are achieved.\r\n\r\nIt is just the same in boxing. No one who has the least knowledge of\r\nsparring strikes a round-handed blow, for, putting aside the ease with\r\nwhich it is parried or avoided, it has scarcely any force in it. When a\r\nboxer hits “straight from the shoulder,” he not only straightens the\r\nToggle-joint of his left arm, but that of his right knee also, so that\r\nthe force of the blow comes quite as much from the leg as the arm.\r\n\r\nIt is by the right use of this joint that a small man, provided he be an\r\nexpert boxer, will easily conquer an ignorant opponent who far surpasses\r\nhim in size and weight. I have seen in a sparring-match a man not only\r\nknocked down, but fairly lifted off his feet, by a blow from a smaller\r\nopponent. The blow took effect under the chin, and, as the boxer hit\r\nexactly the right moment in straightening both limbs, a very great force\r\nwas exerted with little apparent effort. I do not know which of the two\r\ncombatants was the more astonished, the one to find himself on his back\r\nwithout exactly knowing how he got there, and the other to see his\r\nantagonist prostrate without exactly knowing how the thing was done.\r\n\r\nThe jointed apparatus by which the heads of carriages are raised or\r\nlowered is a good example of the Toggle, and exemplifies the force which\r\na comparatively slight piece of machinery can exercise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER form of the Toggle-joint is the process called by sailors\r\n“bowsing” of rope. If a rope be fastened at both ends, and then pulled\r\nin the middle, the ends are drawn forcibly towards each other. This plan\r\nis mostly adopted in getting up sails. When a sail, say the mainsail of\r\na cutter, has to be hoisted as far as it will go, the last few inches\r\nare always very obstinate. The word is then given to “bowse.” The rope,\r\nor haulyard, is no longer pulled at the end, but a turn is taken round\r\nthe cleat, so that it does not give way. The rope is then forcibly\r\npulled away from the mast, when up goes the gaff a little higher. In\r\nthis way, by repeated bowsings, the gaff is coaxed, so to speak, up the\r\nmast, and forced into its place.\r\n\r\nSome of the leaf-rolling caterpillars act in a similar manner, by\r\nalternately bowsing and shortening their lines. As, however, their mode\r\nof working will be described under another heading, we will say no more\r\nof them at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCRUSHING INSTRUMENTS.--THE NUT-CRACKERS, ROLLING-MILL, AND\r\nGRINDSTONE.--PRESSURE OF ATMOSPHERE.--SEED DIBBLES AND DRILLS.\r\n\r\n     Importance of Leverage in Crushing Power.--Nut-crackers a Lever of\r\n     the Second Order.--The Chaff-cutting and Tobacconists’\r\n     Machines.--Jaws of various Animals.--The Wolf-fish or\r\n     Sea-wolf.--The Rolling-mill and its Action.--Gunpowder-mills and\r\n     Granulating Machine.--The “Jacob’s Ladder.”--The Mangle and its\r\n     various Adaptations.--The Grindstone.--Primitive Grindstones of the\r\n     Savage Races.--The Kafirs and the Inhabitants of\r\n     Palestine.--Ceasing of the Millstone.--“Facing” of\r\n     Millstones.--Tusk of the Elephant and its Structure.--Its Facings\r\n     always preserved.--Power of Self-renewal.--Pressure of\r\n     Atmosphere.--The Napier Coffee Machine.--The Cupping\r\n     Instrument.--The Pneumatic Peg.--The Magdeburg Hemispheres.--Plane\r\n     Surfaces of Glass or Metal.--Suckers of the Cuttle-fish.--Foot of\r\n     the Water-beetle.--The Limpet.--The Star-fish and its Mode of\r\n     Progression.--The Sucking-fish and the Fables connected with\r\n     it.--Its real Structure.--Modification of the Dorsal Fin.--The\r\n     Gobies and Lump-fish.--The Gecko and Tree-frog.--The Lampern and\r\n     the Medicinal Leech.--Seed Dibbles and Drills.--Labourers versus\r\n     Machinery.--Natural Dibble of the Grasshopper.--The Daddy\r\n     Long-legs.--Drills and Dibbles of the Ichneumon-flies.--A wonderful\r\n     Specimen from Bogotá.--The Pelecinus and its Mode of laying Eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUSHING INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nAs we are on the subject of leverage, we will take some examples of\r\nlevers in Art and Nature, without, however, even attempting to exhaust\r\nthe topic.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration is shown a very familiar example\r\nof a lever, namely, nut-crackers, with a nut between them. This useful\r\nimplement is simply an adaptation of levers of the second kind, the\r\npower being represented by the human hand, the weight by the nut, and\r\nthe fulcrum being the joint of the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe common chaff-cutter, which is worked by hand, is another familiar\r\nexample of this kind of lever, and so is the knife used by tobacconists\r\nin cutting cake Cavendish into threads, and by druggists for similar\r\npurposes. In these instruments the point of the knife is jointed to some\r\nfixed object, and becomes the fulcrum; the hand of the cutter supplies\r\nthe power, and the weight is the object which is being cut. It will be\r\nseen that, by increasing the length of the handle, very great power can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAWS OF WOLF-FISH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NUT-CRACKERS.]\r\n\r\nExchanging the power for weight, we have in the common tongs, whether\r\nused for the coals or for sugar, a leverage of a similar character, the\r\nweight moving over a greater space than the power. A good example of\r\nthis is to be found in the deltoid muscle of the human arm. The muscle,\r\nwhich furnishes the power, contracts about an inch, and, so doing, moves\r\nthe hand over some forty inches of space. It has been well stated that\r\nif a man is able to hold in his hand, and with extended arm, a weight of\r\ntwenty-five pounds, the muscle must be exerting a power of forty times\r\nas great, _i.e._ about a thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is little doubt that, in such Crushing Instruments as have been\r\nmentioned, the idea has been taken from the jaws of sundry animals. We\r\nknow, for example, that with ourselves, if we desire to crack a walnut\r\nor a filbert in our teeth, we always put it as far back as possible, so\r\nas to make the leverage as powerful as possible. No one would ever dream\r\nof cracking a nut with his front teeth, an act which would be very much\r\nlike that of trying to break a piece of coal by pinching it with the\r\ntongs.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand figure of the illustration represents part of the jaws of\r\nthe Wolf-fish, or Sea-wolf, as it is sometimes called, and a very\r\nwonderful crushing machine it is. The Sea-wolf (_Anarrhicas lupus_),\r\nsometimes called the Sea-cat, or Swine-fish, is tolerably common on our\r\ncoasts, and, as it sometimes attains a length of seven feet, and is\r\nproportionately stout and muscular, the power of its bite may be\r\nestimated. The fish in question feeds chiefly on crustacea and\r\nhard-shelled molluscs, and is therefore furnished with an apparatus\r\nwhich can crush their shells. Extremes meet. The Sea-anemones, which are\r\nmere films of animal matter, and can be torn in pieces with the finger\r\nand thumb, can seize, swallow, and digest a crab or an oyster in spite\r\nof the thick and strong shells in which they are enclosed. So can the\r\nSea-wolf, and fishes of a similar character. But nothing intermediate\r\ncan touch them, and it is curious to reflect that such opposite means\r\nshould produce a similar effect.\r\n\r\nOn reference to the illustration, the reader will see how exact is the\r\nparallel between the Nut-crackers and the Sea-wolf’s jaws, both being\r\nworked on the same principle, and both being furnished with a series of\r\nprojecting points, which are used for the purpose of preventing the\r\nescape of the object which is to be crushed. The terrible grasping power\r\nof the crocodile, the dolphin, and other predacious creatures can be\r\nexplained on the same principle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROLLING-MILL.\r\n\r\nWe now come to another variation of the Crushing Machine, _i.e._ that in\r\nwhich the motion is constant, and not intermittent, as is the case with\r\nthose machines which have just been mentioned.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may have visited those great iron-works in\r\nwhich huge masses of iron are rolled into plates of greater or less\r\nthickness, or are cut up into strips as easily as if they were butter.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism is in its principle simple enough. The cylindrical rollers\r\nare placed nearly in contact, and forced towards each other by\r\nmechanical means, such as levers, screws, or springs, or all three\r\ncombined. These cylinders revolve in opposite directions, and, if any\r\nobject be placed between them, they draw it through them, and present it\r\non the other side in a flattened condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAWS OF SKATE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRUSHING-MILL AND ROLLER.]\r\n\r\nMany years ago, one of my schoolfellows, who had been brought up\r\nentirely under the care of some maiden ladies, was visiting a workshop,\r\nand must needs put his finger between two revolving rollers. Of course\r\nthe hand was drawn between them, and simply squeezed flat. The machine\r\nwas instantly stopped, and the hand extricated; and the strange thing\r\nwas, that the crushed and shapeless hand afterwards recovered its full\r\npower, though not its shape, and was able to touch the keys of the\r\npiano.\r\n\r\nThe whole process of the Rolling-mill is singularly interesting, whether\r\nit be used for large or small objects.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the grooved rollers of the illustration were cut across\r\nso as to present a number of points, it is evident that anything which\r\ngot between them would be bitten to pieces, each piece being of a\r\ntolerably uniform shape.\r\n\r\nThis plan is now adopted in the granulation of gunpowder. After the\r\nfuture powder has emerged from the hydraulic press in the form called\r\n“press-cake,” it was formerly broken to bits with wooden or copper\r\nmallets, and then placed in a very peculiar kind of sieve. This was\r\nshaped like an ordinary sieve, but the bottom was made of cowhide,\r\npierced with innumerable holes. A round pebble was placed in the sieve,\r\nand, when the latter was violently shaken backwards and forwards, the\r\npowder was driven through the holes by the pressure of the stone, and\r\nwas afterwards separated into its various degrees of fineness.\r\n\r\nI have only twice seen this process, and confess to have been in a very\r\nnervous state on both occasions. The sieve is whirled about with\r\nenormous velocity, and the pebble flies round as if it were a thing\r\nalive. Let but a broken needle or a fragment of stone get into the\r\nsieve, or even let the stone itself break asunder, and there will be an\r\ninstantaneous explosion, which will hurl the house, the machinery, and\r\nthe workmen into unknown regions.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the mode of granulating powder is radically altered. There\r\nis a series of double cylinders, such as shown in the illustration, and\r\neach of them has the ridges cut into teeth in regular order. Thus the\r\nfirst set of rollers or cylinders merely bites the press-cake into\r\nconvenient pieces, though seldom of the same weight.\r\n\r\nThe press-cake, thus bitten to pieces, is passed through a series of\r\ncylindrical sieves, each graduated with the utmost accuracy, and being\r\nturned by means of machinery. Being set on a slope, the powder runs by\r\nits own weight down them, and all those particles which cannot pass\r\nthrough the meshes are poured out untouched at the lower end.\r\n\r\nThe portions which are too large to pass the openings of the first sieve\r\nare then handed onwards by means of a machine called a “Jacob’s Ladder,”\r\nwhich consists of a series of little vessels or buckets strung on a\r\ntape, and revolving over a couple of wheels. The first set of buckets\r\ntakes the coarsely bitten press-cake to the second set of rollers, the\r\nteeth of which are comparatively small. Thence it is passed over to a\r\nthird set, and so forth, until it is delivered in any quality of grain\r\nwhich may be required.\r\n\r\nThe modern Mangle, again, affords a good example of this principle. The\r\nold obtrusive, costly, and cumbrous Mangle, which was nothing more than\r\na heavy box of stones upon rollers, has given place to the modern system\r\nof duplex action in rollers, and one of the old Mangles is not easily to\r\nbe seen, unless it be worked as a curiosity. In fact, it is nearly as\r\nobsolete as the spinning-wheel, which yet may be seen in some of our\r\ncountry villages, where scarcely one per cent, of the population has\r\never been in a town, and many of them, the women especially, make it\r\ntheir boast that they have never been beyond the outskirts of their\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThis clumsy machine is now replaced by the very simple invention which\r\nhas been in vogue for some years, and which can not only release, but\r\nregulate, the pressure at any moment, by means of springs, levers, and\r\nweights. This machine is, in fact, exactly the same as that which is\r\nrepresented in the illustration, except that the rollers are quite\r\nsmooth. They can be adjusted to almost any amount of pressure by levers\r\nand weights which are attached to the upper roller, and, when the linen\r\nhas passed through them, it has undergone the double operation of\r\nwringing and mangling. This disposition of the rollers has long been\r\nanticipated in the jaws of the Skate which crush to pieces the shells of\r\nthe whelks, periwinkles, &c., on which the creature feeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRINDSTONE.\r\n\r\nBeing on the subject of jaws and teeth as a mode of breaking to pieces\r\nobjects which are placed between them, we will take those implements\r\nwhich grind to powder, or “triturate,” instead of breaking or\r\nflattening.\r\n\r\nFrom the very earliest ages, and as soon as man had begun to discover\r\nthe “staff of life,” the art of grinding naturally assumed an\r\never-increasing importance.\r\n\r\nThe first and most primitive mode of grinding corn and converting it\r\ninto meal was that which was followed by Sarah, when she welcomed her\r\nhusband’s guests, which we know, from internal evidence, was followed by\r\nthe uncivilised races who formerly inhabited this island, and by many\r\nsemi-savages of the present day.\r\n\r\nNothing could be simpler than the machinery used, and nothing could\r\ncause a greater waste of muscular power. Two stones were employed, a\r\nlarge one upon which the grain was placed, and a smaller which was held\r\nin the hands, and used for grinding the corn to powder, just as the\r\npainters of the last century used to grind their colours. The Kafirs of\r\nSouthern Africa use this simple mill, and so exactly do they keep\r\nunconsciously to the customs of long-perished natives, that if one of\r\ntheir mills were buried for a few years and dug up again, it might be\r\nmistaken for one of the ancient “querns.” As the stone held in the hand\r\nwas rounded, it naturally wore a rounded hollow in the lower stone, and\r\nthis made the process of trituration easier. Perhaps some of my readers\r\nmay have noticed that when a chemist makes up a prescription, and is\r\nobliged to reduce one of the ingredients to powder, he always does so by\r\nrubbing, and not by pounding, as is generally believed. He works the\r\npestle round and round the mortar with a kind of twisting motion, and\r\nthus obtains a powder much too fine to have been produced by any amount\r\nof pounding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOOTH OF ELEPHANT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRINDSTONE.]\r\n\r\nThe labour of this operation is necessarily very severe, and therefore\r\nthe Kafir of the present day, as did his predecessors of the long-lost\r\nraces, declines to do it himself, but hands it over to the women. In\r\nPalestine, as in other parts of the world, a simple mill has been\r\ninvented, which takes away much of the labour, and, above all, releases\r\nthe grinder from the obligation of leaning with her fall weight upon the\r\nupper stone. In this mill the stones are similar. The upper is moved\r\nbackwards and forwards round a pivot, and the grain is passed between\r\nthem by means of a conical aperture in the upper stone, which answers\r\nthe purpose of our “hopper.”\r\n\r\nIn order to work this mill, two women are required, sitting opposite\r\neach other, with the mill between them, holding the same handle, and\r\nassisting each other in turning the stone backwards and forwards. No one\r\nwho has not seen this operation can fully appreciate the force of the\r\nsaying that “two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be\r\ntaken, and the other left.”\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that, even at the present day, the custom of\r\ngrinding corn is carried out in Palestine as it was so many centuries\r\nago, and that it is repeated in Southern Africa among the Kafir tribes.\r\nIn both parts of the earth the first sound of early morning is caused by\r\nthe millstones of the grinding women, and the amount and duration of the\r\nnoise afford a sure test of prosperity. Cessation of the millstones\r\nsignifies adversity and a thin population, as has been said by a writer\r\nwho lived not very far from three thousand years ago. Speaking of\r\ntribulation, he mentions that “the grinders cease because they be few,\r\nand that the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the\r\ngrinding is low.”\r\n\r\nAfter awhile improvements were gradually introduced into the business of\r\ngrinding, not the least of which was covering its surface with ridges,\r\ninstead of leaving it entirely smooth, as it had been formerly. Millers\r\nof the present time know the value of these ridges, and the additional\r\ngrinding power which this “facing” gives to a stone. One of these stones\r\nis represented in the illustration, so as to show the system on which\r\nthe ridges and grooves are constructed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW, passing from Art to Nature, we find that the whole system of the\r\nmillstone, its movement and its ridged surface, existed in the times\r\nwhen man had not yet come upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe reader is probably aware that among the tooth-bearing animals there\r\nare three types of teeth. First come the incisors, or cutting teeth,\r\nwhich occupy the front of the jaw, and find their fullest development in\r\nthe rodent animals, such as the beaver, the squirrel, the rabbit, and\r\nthe rat. Next them come the canine or piercing teeth, which are so\r\nhighly developed in all the cat tribe. Lastly, there are the molar or\r\nmasticating teeth, so called from a Latin word signifying a millstone,\r\nbecause their office is to grind food.\r\n\r\nAs it is with these last that we have now to treat, we will say nothing\r\nabout the others.\r\n\r\nThe molar teeth find their greatest development in the Elephant, the\r\nstructure of whose molars is exactly like that of our modern millstones.\r\nThere is certainly one very great difference. When the surface of a\r\nmillstone is rubbed away, the stone must be re-faced, and sooner or\r\nlater is worn out altogether, and must be replaced with a new one. This,\r\nhowever, is not the case with the Elephant’s molar teeth, which not only\r\nkeep their facing perfectly sharp, but have the faculty of renewing\r\nthemselves as fast as they are worn away.\r\n\r\nHow these important objects are attained we shall now see.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will refer to the upper left-hand figure of the\r\nillustration, he will see that its surface is for the most part round,\r\nwith irregularly oval figures, close and thick at one end, and almost\r\ndisappearing at the other. These are the “facings” of the Elephant’s\r\ntooth, and they are formed as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe tooth, which is of enormous size, is not solid, but is composed of a\r\nnumber of plates laid side by side, like a pack of cards when set on\r\ntheir edge. Each of these plates is composed of a hard external layer of\r\nenamel, and an internal layer of comparatively soft bony matter. A slice\r\nof badly made toast affords a familiar parallel, the half-charred\r\noutside representing the enamel, and the soft, sodden interior being\r\nanalogous to the bony matter. In order to show the arrangement of these\r\nplates, a side view of part of the tooth is given on the same\r\nillustration. Sometimes, when the teeth of fossil elephants are\r\ndiscovered, these plates all fall asunder, the material which connected\r\nthem having been dissolved away in the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we look upon the upper surface of a recent tooth, we see\r\nit present the appearance which is shown in the illustration. The\r\nelongated oval marks are the edges of the hard enamel plates, while the\r\nspaces between them are filled with the soft bony matter. It will be\r\nevident, then, that if two teeth such as these be in opposite jaws, and\r\nperform the task of grinding food, their surface will always be well\r\n“faced.” Owing to the different hardness and density of the enamel and\r\nbony substance, the latter will wear away with comparative rapidity,\r\nleaving the former to project slightly, and thus to preserve the facing\r\nof the natural mill.\r\n\r\nThis is, indeed, but a modification of the beautiful animal mechanism\r\nwhich keeps the teeth of a rodent animal always sharp, and always\r\nbevelled off at the proper angle. If we could invent some plan whereby,\r\nin our millstones, we could make the facing of much harder material\r\nthan the stone, we should make an advance in the miller’s art that would\r\nrender the millstones of the future as far superior to those of the\r\npresent as are our present millstones to the hand “quern” of the Kafir\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nYet another improvement has to be made. Would it be possible to\r\nconstruct a millstone which should not only retain its facing, but\r\npossess the power of renewing itself in proportion as it is worn out?\r\nThis property is found in the Elephant’s tooth, and the illustration\r\nwill give a tolerably good idea of the simple and beautiful mechanism by\r\nwhich it is brought into operation.\r\n\r\nThe tooth, instead of being one solid mass, consists, as I have already\r\nstated, of a series of plates set side by side. These plates are so\r\nconstructed that they are more worn away in front than behind. In\r\nproportion as they are worn, a new tooth is built up behind the old one,\r\nand gradually pushes off the old one. Now, if we could only construct\r\nmillstones with such properties, we should possess an absolutely perfect\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE OF ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nThere are many useful inventions which depend on the weight of the\r\natmosphere and the creation of a more or less perfect vacuum. There is,\r\nfor example, the common Pump, which raises water simply by the action of\r\nthe atmosphere. A pipe passes into the water, and in that pipe an\r\nair-tight piston is inserted. When the piston is drawn upwards a vacuum\r\nis formed, and the water is at once forced into it by the pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThen there is the graceful and useful Napier Coffee-making Machine,\r\nconsisting of a glass globe, and vase of the same material.\r\n\r\nCoffee and boiling water are put into the vase, and some hot water into\r\nthe globe. The two are then connected with the tube, and under the globe\r\nis placed a spirit-lamp. Presently the water in the globe boils,\r\nexpelling the air and filling the globe with steam. The lamp is then\r\nremoved, and the steam in the globe is condensed, leaving a vacuum. The\r\npressure of the atmosphere then comes to bear upon the coffee in the\r\nvase, which is forced through the tube into the globe, producing\r\nbeautifully clear and well-flavoured coffee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSURGERY employs the weight of the atmosphere in the operation called\r\n“Cupping,” now rarely employed, but formerly in such constant use that\r\nscarcely any man who had attained middle age had not undergone it. The\r\noperation was intended for the purpose of removing the blood from some\r\ndefinite spot. Persons, for example, who appeared to have a tendency to\r\napoplexy were regularly cupped between the shoulders twice a year,\r\n_i.e._ in the spring and autumn.\r\n\r\nThe mode of performing the operation is as follows:--A vase-shaped glass\r\nvessel called a cupping-glass is placed close to the skin. The flame of\r\na spirit-lamp is then introduced for a moment in the glass so as to\r\nexpel the air, and the glass is rapidly placed with its mouth downwards\r\non the skin. If this be done with sufficient rapidity, the partial\r\nvacuum in the cupping-glass causes it to adhere to the skin, which is\r\nforced into it by atmospheric pressure, as shown in the illustration.\r\nThe blood is, of course, drawn towards the surface by the same means.\r\n\r\nThe glass is then quickly removed, and a little brass instrument\r\napplied, which, at the touching of a spring, sends out a number of small\r\nlancet-blades so formed as to make very slight cuts. The glass is again\r\napplied, and rapidly becomes filled with blood from the cuts, the air\r\nhaving forced it in exactly as it forces the coffee in Napier’s machine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the upper right-hand corner of the illustration is shown the\r\nPneumatic Peg, a comparatively recent invention, and useful in cases\r\nwhere much strength is not required. The base of the peg is fitted with\r\na sort of cup made of india-rubber. When this base is pressed against a\r\nsmooth and flat surface, such as a pane of glass, the air is forced out\r\nof the cup, and a vacuum formed. The pressure of the atmosphere then\r\ncauses the cup to adhere to the glass with sufficient force to enable\r\nobjects to be suspended from it.\r\n\r\nThe boy’s well-known toy, the Sucker, is made on exactly the same\r\nprinciple. A piece of leather, generally circular, though the shape is\r\nnot of much consequence, has a hole bored through its centre, so as to\r\nallow a string to be attached. The leather is then soaked in water until\r\nit is quite soft. If it be firmly pressed on any smooth object, such as\r\na stone, the air is forced from under it, and it becomes capable of\r\nsustaining a weight in proportion to its dimensions. As the air has a\r\npressure of about fifteen pounds on every square inch, it is easy to\r\ncalculate the weight which it will uphold, a margin being left for\r\nimperfection of vacuum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSUCKERS OF CUTTLE.\r\nLIMPET.\r\nSTAR-FISH.\r\nSUCKING-FISH.\r\nFOOT OF GECKO.\r\nLAMPERN.\r\nCUPPING-GLASS.\r\nPNEUMATIC PEG.\r\nSUCKER.\r\nMAGDEBURG HEMISPHERES.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE lower figure represents the instrument called the Magdeburg\r\nHemispheres, which are made for the purpose of showing the enormous\r\npower of air-pressure. They are two hollowed hemispheres, having their\r\nedges very accurately ground together. When used, a little lard is\r\nrubbed on the edges in order to insure their exact fit, and they are\r\nthen pressed tightly together. The air is removed by means of the\r\ncommon exhausting syringe, and it is found that the two adhere together\r\nwith such force that two strong men cannot pull them asunder. But, if\r\nthe tap be turned, and air admitted, they come apart without the least\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if two plates of glass or metal be ground to exactly plane\r\nsurfaces, and pressed together, they adhere nearly as strongly as if\r\nthey were one solid piece.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now turn from Art to Nature, and examine some natural producers\r\nof vacuum.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated is that series of suckers which may be found\r\nupon the arms of the various Cuttles. At the upper part of the\r\nillustration a figure is given of part of an arm, on which are four\r\nsuckers. When the animal wishes to attach itself to any object, it\r\npresses the disc of the sucker against it, and simultaneously withdraws\r\nthe centre, exactly as the boy does with his toy sucker. And, as each\r\narm contains a great number of suckers, it is evident that the holding\r\npower must be very great. Indeed, on one occasion when a comparatively\r\nsmall specimen had fastened on a man’s arm, he could not remove it, but\r\nwas obliged to have it cut away piecemeal by an assistant.\r\n\r\nThe common Water-beetle has similar suckers upon its first pair of feet,\r\nand can adhere to smooth surfaces with great tenacity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left of the cuttle-arm is the common Limpet, shown as it appears\r\nwhen adhering to the rocks. Every visitor to the seaside who has\r\nattempted to remove the Limpets may remember how difficult it is to stir\r\nthem when they have once taken their hold. If they can be taken by\r\nsurprise, they come away with a touch; but if they become alarmed, they\r\npress the edges of the foot firmly against the rock, withdraw the\r\ncentre, and thus create the necessary vacuum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT follows a Star-fish, shown as it appears when in the act of\r\nwalking, or rather, gliding along.\r\n\r\nThis movement is obtained by the use of a vast number of long suckers,\r\nexactly resembling the pneumatic peg, except that they are flexible,\r\nand can be curved in any direction. It is really beautiful to see the\r\nmanner in which a Star-fish will glide along by means of its suckers,\r\nits arms accommodating themselves to the irregularities of the ground,\r\nand its multitudinous suckers protruded and withdrawn with a\r\nnever-ceasing movement.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the Star-fish is apparently blind, not having any organs which\r\ncan even be conjectured to serve the purpose of vision, this mode of\r\ndirecting its course is not easily understood. Yet, blind though it may\r\nbe, it guides itself with as much accuracy as if it possessed eyes, and\r\nevidently does so with a definite purpose, using its suckers with as\r\nmuch decision as a centipede uses its legs.\r\n\r\nThese suckers can be seen very well by placing a Star-fish in a shallow\r\nvessel of sea-water, and laying it on its back. The suckers immediately\r\nprotrude themselves from their little apertures, and the arms slowly\r\ncurve themselves so as to find something to which the suckers can\r\nadhere. Presently one or two of the suckers will take hold of the bottom\r\nof the vessel. Others soon follow, and in a very short time the\r\nStar-fish is on its legs, if we may so call them, and is quietly gliding\r\non its way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the Star-fish is seen the celebrated Sucking-fish (_Echeneis\r\nremora_) about which so many strange tales have been told, and which is\r\npossessed of a structure remarkable enough to need no aid from\r\ninvention. The dorsal fin of this fish is modified in a most singular\r\nmanner. The spines of which it is so largely composed are metamorphosed\r\ninto flattened plates very much resembling the laths of a Venetian\r\nblind, and form an instrument of suction identical in principle, though\r\nnot in form, with those which have already been described. When the\r\nsucker is pressed against a smooth surface, a vacuum is formed, and the\r\nfish in consequence adheres firmly to the object.\r\n\r\nThe fact has been known for centuries, though it has only been lately\r\ndiscovered, that the sucker was not a separate apparatus, but merely one\r\nof the fins modified in a simple though effective manner. Indeed, any\r\none who has some slight notion of the structure of a fin can easily see,\r\nby looking at the Sucking-fish from above, that the apparatus is\r\nnothing more than the dorsal fin laid flat.\r\n\r\nI may mention here that the name of Echeneis is taken from two words\r\nsignifying “ship-holder.” It was given to the fish on account of a\r\ncurious notion which was fully believed until quite modern times, that\r\nthe Sucking-fish had the power of attaching itself to ships, and holding\r\nthem so firmly that they could not proceed in spite of sails and oars.\r\nThe word Echeneis is used by Aristotle in his “History of Animals.” The\r\nspecific name _remora_, or “delay,” is Latin, and is given to the fish\r\nfor the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe little Gobies, which are so plentiful along our coasts, have the\r\nventral fins formed into a sucker, with which they can cling firmly to\r\nany object, such as a leaf of seaweed or a smooth rock or stone. A\r\nsimilar modification of the ventral fins is also found in the\r\nbeautifully coloured Lump-fish, or Lump-sucker, sometimes called the\r\nCock-paidle. One of these fishes, when placed in a bucket of water,\r\nadhered so strongly to the bottom, that, when lifted by the tail, it\r\nbore the whole weight of the pail and water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJUST below the Sucking-fish is drawn a foot of the curious little\r\nlizard, the Gecko, so called from its peculiar cry. It is common in the\r\nWest Indies, and haunts houses, traversing their walls just as flies run\r\nup panes of glass. It is enabled to perform this movement by means of\r\nthe structure of the feet. As the reader may see by reference to the\r\nillustration, the toes are greatly widened and flattened. If the lower\r\nsurface be examined, it will be found to be furnished with a number of\r\nplates very much resembling those of the sucking-fish, and performing\r\nthe same office.\r\n\r\nSo rapid is the operation of these plates, that the animal can even leap\r\nupon a perpendicular flat surface, and stick there. Perhaps the reader\r\nmay remember that the beautiful Tree-frogs, which cling so tightly to\r\nleaves, are furnished with suckers on their toes, whereby they can hold\r\non even to an upright pane of glass. In fact, the smooth surface of the\r\nglass seems to please them, and when they adhere to it they give an\r\nexcellent opportunity of examining the structure of the feet with a\r\nmagnifying-glass.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the pressure of the atmosphere has been slightly\r\nmentioned, when treating of the ball-and-socket joint. This is the joint\r\nby which the thigh-bone is attached to the hip. As the rounded head of\r\nthe thigh-bone fits exactly into the cavity of the hip, and is,\r\nmoreover, well lubricated with the animal oil called synovia, no air can\r\nobtain admission between the two. Consequently, they are held together\r\nso firmly by the pressure of the atmosphere, that they retain their\r\nplaces even after the whole of the muscular attachments have been\r\nremoved. Not without very great force can the thigh-bone be dislodged\r\nfrom the shallow socket in which it lies; but, if a hole be bored so as\r\nto admit the air, it comes out at once.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, however firmly a limpet may cling to the rock, if the finest\r\nneedle were introduced so as to admit air, the creature could not retain\r\nits hold for a moment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE last figure on the illustration represents the common Lampern\r\n(_Lampetra fluviatilis_).\r\n\r\nThe mouth of this little fish is formed on the principle of the sucker,\r\nand very firmly it can adhere, as I can state from much personal\r\nexperience. Indeed, it is rather alarming, to those who are unacquainted\r\nwith the character of the fish, to have it turn round and fasten upon\r\nthe hand. However, it is quite harmless, and those who are accustomed to\r\nthem will have half-a-dozen hanging on their hand at a time, and take no\r\nnotice of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALREADY has it been mentioned that Surgery has pressed into its service\r\nthe weight of the atmosphere by means of cupping. She also makes use of\r\nNature in a similar manner by employing the Leech for local and surface\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Medicinal Leech forms an exact parallel with the\r\ncupping-glass and lancets, only that it is very far superior in its\r\npowers. To make the analogy perfect, the lancets ought to be within the\r\ncupping-glass, and the latter ought to be able to exhaust the air from\r\nitself, and to be attached to a reservoir into which the blood could be\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nI need hardly mention that the action of sucking as practised by the\r\nyoung of all mammalian beings, from man downwards, is due to the same\r\nprinciple. By the action of sucking a partial vacuum is formed, and the\r\npressure of the atmosphere upon the breasts forces the milk into the\r\nmouth of the young.\r\n\r\nWe might multiply examples _ad infinitum_, and we will therefore pass to\r\nanother subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED-DRILLS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nICHNEUMON-FLY.\r\n\r\nGRASSHOPPER.\r\n\r\nSEED-DRILL.]\r\n\r\nAmong the modern improvements in agriculture we may reckon the invention\r\nof the Seed-drill as one of the most important. By means of this\r\ninvention, seed is greatly economized, the supply can be regulated, and\r\nthe sower knows exactly where every grain of seed goes. There is no\r\nscattering, as in the wasteful broadcast plan, by which the seeds are\r\nflung almost at random over the field, and may or may not fall into the\r\nfurrows. The Seed-drill, on the contrary, either stamps holes or ploughs\r\nnarrow furrows, measures the seed into them, and in some machines\r\nreplaces the earth. The former kind of machine rather deserves the name\r\nof a dibble, and was invented for the purpose of superseding the use of\r\nthe hand-dibble.\r\n\r\nIt is really a pitiful thing to see human beings endowed with reason and\r\naspirations performing such a task as dibbling by hand, one going\r\nbackwards with a dibble in each hand, and the other following and\r\nputting seed into the holes. Yet the field labourers have the greatest\r\nobjection to the machine dibble, as, indeed, they have to any sort of\r\nlabour-saving machine, thinking that it will lessen the demand for\r\nlabour, and prevent them from earning a livelihood.\r\n\r\nI well remember how a country clergyman, pitying the hard toil of the\r\nhand-dibblers, took occasion when he visited town to purchase a machine\r\ndibble wherewith one man could set eight rows of beans at once. It was a\r\nvery simple affair, comprehensible even by the dull brain of a Wiltshire\r\nlabourer. His trouble was all in vain, for no one would use it, and\r\nthere was such a disturbance about it in the village, that for the sake\r\nof peace its owner laid it up in a loft and abandoned its use. There\r\nmight be some semblance of reason in thinking that it would deprive them\r\nof their field labour, but no cottager would even use it in his own\r\ngarden, though it was freely offered to any one who wished to borrow it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHESE machines have their parallels in Nature, two of which are\r\nrepresented in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe lower left-hand figure represents the female Grasshopper depositing\r\nher eggs. She is furnished with a sharply pointed ovipositor, composed\r\nof two blades. When she is about to lay her eggs, she searches for a\r\nsuitable piece of ground, where the earth is tolerably soft, and with\r\nthe closed ovipositor bores a hole. She then separates the blades\r\nslightly, and an egg glides between them into the ground, precisely as\r\nis done by the machine dibble with its beans. When I first saw and used\r\nthe instrument, some twenty-five years ago, the parallel struck me at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE female of the familiar Daddy Long-legs (_Tipula_) acts in a similar\r\nmanner. She is furnished with an ovipositor too short to be used like\r\nthat of the grasshopper, and so she attains her object in a rather\r\ndifferent manner. Making use of her long stilt-like legs, she sets\r\nherself nearly upright, with the point of the ovipositor in the ground.\r\nShe then twists herself from side to side, just after the principle of\r\nthe bradawl, and so proceeds until she has made a hole large enough for\r\nher purpose. The blades of the ovipositor are then separated, and the\r\negg placed in the hole, as has been described of the grasshopper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE upper figure represents one of the large Ichneumon-flies depositing\r\nthe egg in the grub of some wood-inhabiting larva. How she bores the\r\nhole has already been described when treating of Boring Tools, and the\r\nprocess need not again be discussed. The principal point at present is,\r\nthat after the hole is bored, an egg can pass between the blades of the\r\novipositor, though they are but little thicker than human hairs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary instances of this kind of ovipositor is\r\nfound in an Ichneumon-fly brought from Bogotá. The body, from the head\r\nto the end of the tail, is not quite an inch long, while the ovipositor\r\nis six inches and a half in length, and scarcely thicker than that of\r\nthe insect whose portrait is given in the illustration. Nothing is as\r\nyet known of its habits, so that the object of this wonderfully long\r\novipositor is a mystery. But that it should be used like other\r\novipositors is evident enough, and the chief wonder is, what are the\r\nmechanical means whereby an egg can be propelled between blades so long\r\nand slender.\r\n\r\nThere is a genus of Ichneumon-flies called Pelecinus. They deposit their\r\neggs in wood-boring larvæ, and we might imagine that the ovipositor\r\nwould be a long one. It is, however, extremely short, and the requisite\r\nlength is obtained by the form of the abdomen, the joints of which are\r\nso long and narrow that they almost look as if they had passed through a\r\nwire-drawing machine, the length of the head and throat being\r\nthree-eighths of an inch, and that of the abdomen an inch and a half.\r\nThis long abdomen belongs only to the female, that of the male being\r\nshort and club-shaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCLOTH-DRESSING.--BRUSHES AND COMBS.--BUTTONS, HOOKS AND EYES, AND CLASP.\r\n\r\n     The Teazle and its Structure.--Its Use in raising the “Nap” on\r\n     Cloth.--Its Value in Commerce.--Artificial Teazles.--The modern\r\n     Cloth-dressing Machine.--The Brush an Article of\r\n     Luxury.--Definition of the Brush, and its various Uses.--Brushes in\r\n     Nature.--The Foot of the Fly and the Tail-brush of the Glow-worm\r\n     Larva.--Mode in which they are used.--The Comb.--Varieties of the\r\n     Comb as made in different Countries.--Combs in Nature.--Foot of the\r\n     Spider and its Uses.--Beak of the Toucan.--Comb of the\r\n     Scorpion.--Buttons, Hooks and Eyes.--Use of the Button.--The\r\n     Egyptian Garment.--The Buckle and the Shoe-tie.--The\r\n     Clasp.--Wing-hooks of various Insects.--The Saddle-back Oyster.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTH-DRESSING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nIn former days, when so much was done by hand that is now done by\r\nmachinery, the thistle called the Teazle (_Dipsacus fullonum_) was of\r\ngreat value in British commerce, being used by countless thousands in\r\nthe manufacture of broadcloth.\r\n\r\nWhen the woollen threads are woven so as to form the fabric of the\r\ncloth, there is no nap upon them, this having to be produced by a\r\nsubsequent process. The plan of former days was, to procure a quantity\r\nof the seed-vessels of the Teazle, and dry them. They were then fastened\r\nto an instrument something like a wooden battledore, and swept over the\r\nsurface of the cloth. By degrees the delicate hooklets which terminate\r\nthe many scales of the seed-vessel tore up the fibres of the cloth, and\r\nproduced the desired nap without impairing the strength of the thread.\r\nWhen this nap is worn off, the threads are again visible, producing the\r\neffect called “threadbare.”\r\n\r\nAs the art of weaving continued to progress, the demand for Teazles\r\nincreased in due proportion, and vast quantities were imported from\r\nabroad. Instead of being used by band, they were then fastened to the\r\ncircumference of wooden wheels as broad as the width of the cloth, and\r\nmade to revolve rapidly, while the cloth was pressed against them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEAZLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOTH-DRESSING.]\r\n\r\nFor many years attempts had been made to construct artificial Teazles\r\nwhich would not wear out so rapidly as did the dry seed-vessels, but\r\nnothing could be constructed that was not too stiff or too strong, and\r\nwhich did not injure the threads while producing the nap. At last,\r\nhowever, this difficult problem has been solved, and the Teazle is no\r\nlonger an important article of commerce, its place being supplied by\r\ndelicately made cards of the finest and most elastic wire.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration a head of Teazle is given on the left hand, and on\r\nthe right is seen the mode in which the wire cards are placed in the\r\nmachine, and the cloth drawn over them so as to produce the required\r\nnap.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSHES.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that there are many articles of comparative\r\nluxury which could not be used until man had attained some degree of\r\ncivilisation. Among these we may class the Brush and the Comb, no true\r\nsavage ever troubling himself about either article. The Brush, indeed,\r\nbelongs to a much more advanced stage of civilisation than the Comb, for\r\nwhereas we find combs, however rude they may be, used in semi-savage, or\r\nrather, barbarian countries, the Brush is, as far as I know, an adjunct\r\nof a high state of civilisation.\r\n\r\nBrushes may be defined to be instruments formed of fibres set more or\r\nless parallel to each other. The vast variety of brushes used in\r\ndifferent parts of Europe is indicative of the civilisation of the\r\nnations who use them. Take, for example, the brushes used in household\r\nmanagement, such as the hearth-brush, the housemaid’s brush, the\r\nTurk’s-head brush, the crumb-brush, the stair-brush, the carpet-brush,\r\nthe dusting brush, and many others.\r\n\r\nThen we have those which are applied to our garments, such as the\r\nordinary clothes-brush, the velvet-backed hat-brush, and the three kinds\r\nof boot-brushes.\r\n\r\nIn architecture, again, we should be very badly off without the\r\npainting-brushes, the whitewasher’s brush, and the paper-hanger’s brush;\r\nnot to mention the exceeding variety of brushes used by artists both in\r\noil and water colours.\r\n\r\nAs to brushes applied to our persons, we have an infinite number of\r\nthem. There is, of course, the hair-brush, without a pair of which, one\r\nfor each hand, no one with a respectable head of hair could be expected\r\nto be happy.\r\n\r\nWe may add to this the revolving brush worked by machinery, which is to\r\nbe found in the rooms of any respectable hairdresser, and which is a\r\nsort of an apotheosis of the Hair-brush, especially when it is worked,\r\nas in some places, by the electrical engine.\r\n\r\nThen there is the shaving-brush, once an absolutely necessary article in\r\na gentleman’s dressing-case, and above all requisite if the owner should\r\nhappen to be a clergyman. Nowadays, shaving is rapidly decreasing, and\r\nof all the professions, those who are most largely bearded, both in\r\nnumber of beard-wearers and dimensions of the beard, are to be found\r\namong the clergy.\r\n\r\nThen there are any number of tooth-brushes for the interior of the\r\nmouth, and of flesh-brushes, with or without handles, for the service of\r\nthe bath. There are even gardeners’ brushes, for the purpose of clearing\r\nthe plants of the aphides, or green-blight, as these insects are\r\npopularly called by gardeners. So it will be seen that--absurd as the\r\nproposition may appear at first sight--we may really accept the use of\r\nthe brush as a safe test of the progress of civilisation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now glance at the illustrations of this subject.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand is depicted the once honoured Shaving-brush, the\r\nterror of all stiff-bearded men on frosty mornings, and yet clung to\r\nwith a strange inconsistency. Many years ago a military member of the\r\nHouse of Commons was sensible enough to wear his beard, and was, in\r\nconsequence, the butt for interminable jokes. At the present time, if\r\nthe House were counted, a great majority of the younger, and not a few\r\nof the older, members will be found to wear either the beard or\r\nmoustache, or both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOOT OF FLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRUSH OF GLOW-WORM LARVA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAIR-BRUSHES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHAVING-BRUSH.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may object that many nations in a state of\r\nvery partial civilisation are accustomed to shaving. So they are, but\r\nthey do not use the shaving-brush. Most of them content themselves with\r\npulling out the hairs by the roots, while others merely saturate the\r\nhair with hot water, and so need no brush.\r\n\r\nNext to the shaving-brush is drawn a pair of ordinary Hair-brushes, such\r\nas have been mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSING to the left, we find an object which bears a curious resemblance\r\nto the shaving-brush. This is an apparatus belonging to the larva or\r\ngrub of the Glow-worm. This creature feeds upon snails, and, in\r\nconsequence, gets itself covered with the tenacious slime. In order to\r\nenable it to rid itself of this inconvenience, the larva is furnished\r\nnear the end of its tail with the curious apparatus which is here shown.\r\nIt consists of some seven or eight soft white radii, arranged so as to\r\nproduce a brush-like outline, and being capable of extension or\r\nwithdrawal at will.\r\n\r\nIt had long been known that this “houppe nerveuse,” as it is called, was\r\nemployed as an assistant in locomotion; but until comparatively late\r\nyears--I believe about 1826--no one seemed to be aware that it was used\r\nas a brush. Its functions as a brush may be compared with the somewhat\r\nsimilar offices fulfilled by the pincers of the Earwig, as mentioned on\r\npage 259.\r\n\r\nNext to the brush of the glow-worm larva is shown one of the fore-feet\r\nof the ordinary house-fly, much magnified. Passing, as irrelevant to the\r\npresent subject, the use of the feet as organs of locomotion, we may\r\ntake them as being used for the purpose of cleansing the body of the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nI suppose that none of my readers has been sufficiently inobservant not\r\nto have noticed the way in which a fly cleanses itself, behaving almost\r\nexactly like a cat under similar circumstances. The fore-feet are\r\nrepeatedly passed over the head, which is bowed down to meet them, while\r\na similar office is performed for the rest of the body by the hind-legs.\r\nThe feet are then rubbed against each other, so as to free them from all\r\naccumulations, just as the housemaid cleanses the hair-brush with the\r\ncomb before washing it. So mechanical is this process, that a fly has\r\nbeen known to go through it even after it had been deprived of its head.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see, on reference to the illustration, that the two\r\nsharp and curved claws are capable of answering the purpose of combs,\r\nand, indeed, are so employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBS.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to the COMB, and see how Art has been anticipated by\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nAs long as human beings possess hair upon their heads, whether it be the\r\nshort, frizzed, woolly pile of the negro, the thick, coarse crop of the\r\nFijian, the coarse, straight hair of the Mongolian, or the long and fine\r\nhair of the Georgian races, they must, as soon as they attempt any kind\r\nof civilisation, form some instruments by which the hair can be dressed.\r\nThe simplest machine for this purpose is the Comb, and I possess many\r\nvarieties of this article, suitable to the different races for whom it\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the ordinary Combs of our European civilisation, such as\r\nare given in the illustration, there are many others which are modified\r\naccording to the use which they have to fulfil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFOOT OF SPIDER.\r\n\r\nBEAK OF TOUCAN.\r\n\r\nCOMBS.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest is the Comb of the celebrated Amazon regiment of Dahomey.\r\nThis is nothing but a slight skewer of ivory, some ten inches in length,\r\nand amply sufficient for arranging the short woolly lumps which do duty\r\nfor hair on the head of a true negro. One of these very primitive combs\r\nis in my collection, together with an undress costume of the Amazon in\r\nquestion, and both being very much suited to each other. The comb being\r\na simple skewer, the dress is only a few thongs of leather, but they are\r\nboth equal to the requirements of their wearers.\r\n\r\nAs much time would be lost in combing the hair with a single skewer,\r\nespecially when that hair belonged to any but the pure negro races, a\r\nsimple but obvious improvement was introduced. A number of skewers were\r\nlashed together side by side, with their ends a little diverging, and\r\nthus was formed the germ of our present Combs.\r\n\r\nAs to the varieties of the Comb, they are simply endless; and whether\r\nthey are intended, in the form of the Currycomb, to smooth the harsh\r\ncoat of a horse, or, as a small-tooth Comb, to search the hair of the\r\nyoung, they are all based on one principle.\r\n\r\nIt is really curious to see how often two men, who cannot possibly have\r\nseen each other, will hit upon the same idea, not only simultaneously,\r\nbut often in the very same words. So it is with regard to the Comb. In\r\nno two parts of the world can the natives be more opposed to each other\r\nthan is the case with Fiji and Western Africa; yet I possess specimens\r\nof combs from both countries, made on the same principles, and so\r\nexactly in the same manner, that, except for the coarseness of the\r\nAfrican Comb, it would be almost impossible to distinguish between them.\r\nThere is but a slight difference in the size and shape of the two combs,\r\nand yet nothing can be more distinct than the characters of the two\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nI have also a Japanese Comb of the most ingenious construction. It is\r\nmade of wood, and cut exactly like our double ivory small-tooth comb;\r\nbut it is furnished with a curious kind of handle, consisting of a flat\r\npiece of wood with a deep longitudinal slit, into which either side of\r\nthe comb fits; and so beautifully is it made, that when it is fitted\r\nupon either side of the comb it looks as if handle and comb had been cut\r\nout of the same piece of wood.\r\n\r\nThe Fijian Combs are much after the same fashion as those of Western\r\nAfrica, except that, with the artistic nature of their kind, the\r\nFijians, instead of merely lashing together the numerous spikes of which\r\nthe comb is made, employ a variety of patterns, and seem to luxuriate in\r\nthe exuberance of artistic spirit which can make hundreds of combs, and\r\nno two of them alike.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration are two examples of Natural Combs\r\nwhich are well worthy of notice. The upper one is a foot of the common\r\nGarden Spider (_Epeira diadema_), which has been several times mentioned\r\nin this work in connection with different subjects.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has watched the life of one of these creatures must have\r\nnoticed how often its hairy body becomes clogged with little bits of its\r\nown web, and how dexterously it releases itself from such encumbrances.\r\nThe figure in the illustration shows how this can be done, the strangely\r\nformed foot acting at the same time the part of comb and brush. It will\r\nbe seen that the curved spikes of the claws act as a comb, while the\r\nbristle-like hairs discharge the duty of a brush.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOT only are these projections used as Combs, but as appendages which\r\ninsure the security of footing along the lines of the web. The reader\r\nwill easily remember that when a Spider rushes along its web to secure\r\nits prey, it always runs along one of the radiating lines, which have no\r\nviscid drops, and that it never misses its hold. The latter point is\r\nsecured by the structure of its claws, which are so made that if one\r\nprojection misses the line, another is sure to fasten upon it. Some\r\nyears ago, while watching “Blondin” go through his wonderful\r\nperformances, I was especially struck with the pattern on which he had\r\nconstructed the stilts upon which he traversed the rope. They were made\r\nin the most exact imitation of the Spider’s foot, and though it is not\r\nprobable that he borrowed them from that object, the resemblance was so\r\nclose that he might readily have done so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the spider’s foot is given the head of a Toucan, one of those\r\nbeautifully coloured and large-billed birds that inhabit tropical\r\nAmerica. These birds are very particular about their plumage, and even\r\nwhen in captivity dress their feathers with the utmost care. When they\r\ndo so, the saw-like notches of the beak act the part of a comb, and the\r\nfibrils of the feathers are by their action dressed parallel to each\r\nother, and give to the whole bird its proper appearance of health.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI MAY here mention that there is one comb in Nature, the use of which\r\nhas never been clearly ascertained. This is the remarkable organ found\r\nin the Scorpion, and simply known as the “comb.” There are two of them,\r\none on each side of the under surface. Their colour differs slightly\r\naccording to the species, but is generally a light yellow brown. The\r\nnumber of teeth also differs extremely, for in the Rock Scorpion there\r\nare only thirteen teeth, while in the Red Scorpion there are\r\ntwenty-eight.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTONS, HOOKS AND EYES, AND CLASP.\r\n\r\nHAVING now treated of brushes and combs as articles belonging to the\r\ntoilet, we will proceed to those which belong to the dress rather than\r\nthe person. It is a curious fact that, as far as is known, buttons and\r\nhooks belong only to advanced civilisation. The simplest garment is, of\r\ncourse, a cloth of some material wrapped round the waist, and, as we see\r\nin the wonderful Egyptian paintings which have survived their painters\r\nsome three thousand years, the simple fold can retain its grasp round\r\nthe loins, even through the exertions of a long day’s work.\r\n\r\nI was always at a loss, when looking at these drawings, to understand\r\nhow a single fold could retain so simple a garment in its place, but\r\nwhen I made my first visit to the Hammam Turkish Bath in Jermyn Street\r\nthe mystery was at once solved. The “check,” as it is there called, is\r\nlong enough to pass about once and a half round the waist of an ordinary\r\nman. One end of it is placed on the left side, so as to bring the lower\r\nedge on a level with the knee. It is held by the left hand until the\r\nright hand passes it round the waist. It is then turned over in a broad\r\nsingle fold, and will remain in position for hours, the left leg having\r\nfree scope between the two ends, and yet not being needlessly exposed.\r\n\r\nNext to the simple fold comes the tie, which is in use all over the\r\nworld. The chief object of a good Tie is that it should retain its hold\r\nas long as needed, be loosened with a touch in necessity, and, as a\r\nmatter of consequence, should never “jam.”\r\n\r\nStill, even the best of ties are liable to objection. I once heard an\r\nargument on the subject of ties and buckles with regard to shoes. The\r\nspeakers were both Derbyshire men, and their phraseology was somewhat\r\nobscure. However, both stuck to his own principles, one saying that\r\n“when a shee-uew is boo-oo-oockled, it’s boo-oo-ookled;” and the other\r\nasserting, in equally strong terms, that “when it’s tee-ee-eed, it’s\r\ntee-ee-eed.”\r\n\r\nThe buckle was here asserting its supremacy in civilisation over the\r\ntie, and was palpably right. Any one, so rose the argument, can tie two\r\nstrings together, but the structure of the buckle is too complicated to\r\nbe understood, much less invented, by any uncivilised being.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT come, in natural order, the Button and the Clasp, each being\r\nidentical in principle. In the case of the former the “eye” is placed\r\nover the button, while in the latter the clasp or hook is passed through\r\nthe eye. Several examples of the Button and the Clasp are given on the\r\nright hand of the illustration, and are too familiar to need\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAS to the corresponding articles in Nature, they are very numerous. We\r\nwill take, for example, the Saddle-back or Crow Oyster of our own\r\nshores. It is a most remarkable being. It deposits upon the object to\r\nwhich it adheres a sort of button of shelly matter, and the lower valve,\r\nwhich is nearly flat, has in it an aperture which is placed over the\r\nknob, just as a button-hole goes over the button. As this arrangement is\r\nconfined to the lower valve, and cannot be seen unless the upper valve\r\nbe removed, the lower valve only is shown in the illustration, as it\r\nappears when fastened to the side of a large limpet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WING-HOOKS OF INSECT. SADDLE-BACK OYSTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLASPS AND BUTTON.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOF the Hooks and Eyes in Nature I have only taken two examples, though\r\nthere are many others.\r\n\r\nWe all know the Bees, Wasps, Hornets, and other similar insects, and\r\nthat they possess four wings. I may here mention that no insect which\r\ndoes not possess four transparent wings is capable of stinging.\r\n\r\nWhen the insect is at rest the four wings may be easily distinguished,\r\nbut when it is in flight they coalesce, so that practically the insect\r\nhas two wings instead of four. This object is attained in the following\r\nway:--\r\n\r\nThe lower edge of the first pair of wings is turned over in a rather\r\nstiff fold. The upper edge of the second pair of wings has a row of\r\nsmall, but strong and elastic hooks. When the insect is about to fly,\r\nthe hooks are hitched into the fold, and so the wings are fastened\r\ntogether. These hooks are shown in the illustration, and the reader will\r\neasily see how effective they must be in their operation. An almost\r\nexactly similar structure is found in the feathers of birds, and it is\r\nby means of these tiny hooks that wings are enabled to present a\r\ncontinuous, light, and elastic surface in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE STOPPER, OR CORK.--THE FILTER.\r\n\r\n     Vessels and their Covers.--Corks.--Mode of bottling Wine.--Conical\r\n     Corks and Stoppers.--Self-fitting Candles.--Candle-fixers.--The\r\n     Vent-peg.--The Blow-guns and their Missiles.--The Serpula and its\r\n     Conical Stopper.--The Filter.--The Bosjesman procuring Water.--How\r\n     to make a simple Filter.--The Earth as a Filter.--The Sea-mouse, or\r\n     Aphrodite, and its filtering Apparatus.--The Duck’s Beak, and its\r\n     beautiful Structure.--The Jaw of the Greenland\r\n     Whale.--Fork-grinder’s Respirator.--How Insects\r\n     breathe.--Spiracles, and their general Structure.--Spiracle of the\r\n     Fly.--Experiment upon a Cockroach, and its Result.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STOPPER, OR CORK.\r\n\r\nThis object, as depicted in the illustration, is a product of civilised\r\nlife, though, as soon as a savage could make a vessel, he seems to have\r\nmade a Cover for it if it were of large diameter, or a Stopper if the\r\nopening were small. Even the very Bosjesman, who is quite unable to make\r\na clay vessel, and uses empty ostrich eggs by way of water-bottles, is\r\nyet capable of making plugs with which he can stop up the apertures.\r\nThen the Kafir, with his gourd vessels, whether they be for water or\r\nsnuff, makes a plug that fits tightly enough to exclude the air, as well\r\nas to retain the contents.\r\n\r\nThe invention of glass bottles necessarily brought with it the\r\nintroduction of a new kind of plug, and a material for such a plug was\r\nfound in the bark of the cork-tree, a species of oak. This bark\r\npossesses the capability of compression to a very great extent, and,\r\nbeing highly elastic, it expands as soon as the pressure is removed.\r\n\r\nThus, in bottling wine, the corks are always made much too large to go\r\ninto the mouths of the bottles. They are first dipped in a cup\r\ncontaining the same wine, and are then compressed violently by a machine\r\nworked by a handle, and which, being practically a powerful pair of\r\nnut-crackers with a rounded gripe, must suit the shape of the cork. It\r\nis then taken out of the machine, and, before it has had time to expand,\r\nis rapidly fitted to the neck of the bottle, and driven home with a\r\nwooden mallet. Expansion then takes place, and the bottle is rendered\r\nair-tight, so that no damage is done to the wine.\r\n\r\nIf the whole of the wine were to be drunk when the cork was removed,\r\nthis plan would be amply sufficient. But there are many cases where the\r\nbottle is opened, and only part of the wine consumed. To re-cork the\r\nbottle would be too troublesome, and to leave it uncorked would spoil\r\nthe wine. So the Conical Stopper was invented, which fits the neck of\r\nany ordinary wine-bottle, according to the depth to which it is\r\nintroduced, and, by a slight screwing movement, sufficient compression\r\nis obtained to render the bottle air-tight. One of these Conical\r\nStoppers is shown in the illustration on page 352. Sometimes they are\r\nmade of cork, and sometimes of india-rubber; but the principle is the\r\nsame in either case.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may have seen the Self-fitting Candles, which\r\nrequire no paper to make them fit the candlestick. These are enlarged at\r\nthe base, which is made in a conical form, and slightly grooved. The\r\n“Candle-fixers” that are so much in use at the present day are made\r\nexactly on the same principle, being hollow cones of paper, which take\r\nthe place of the solid cone.\r\n\r\nThe Vent-peg of casks is another instance of the cone used as a stopper.\r\n\r\nAnother example is to be found in the Blow-guns and Arrows of tropical\r\nAmerica. In some districts the base of the arrow is fitted with a\r\nconical appendage of light cotton, rather larger than the tube, but\r\ncapable of compression, so that it exactly fits the tube when pressed\r\ninto it. In other districts the cone is hollow, and made of some thin\r\nand elastic bark.\r\n\r\nSome years ago one of our most eminent gun-makers hit upon the same idea\r\nwhile making improved missiles for the game of “Puff and Dart,” and very\r\nmuch surprised he was when I showed him the South American arrow, not\r\nonly with the same hollow cone at the base, but having also spiral\r\nwings along the shaft, so as to give it a rotatory motion as it passed\r\nthrough the air. The hollow cones of his darts were made of\r\nindia-rubber, but the shape of the two was identical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIF the reader will refer to the left-hand figure of the illustration, he\r\nwill see a beautiful example of the Conical Stopper as existing in\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nThis is the “Stopper,” as it is popularly called, and, scientifically,\r\nthe “infundibuliform operculum.” I prefer the former term myself, as\r\nbeing less liable to misapprehension.\r\n\r\nThe Serpula lives in a shelly tube of its own construction, and has the\r\npower of protruding itself when it desires to obtain food, and of\r\nwithdrawing itself within the tube when alarmed. This movement is\r\nperformed so rapidly, that the eye can scarcely follow it, and the\r\nmechanism by which it is done has already been described when treating\r\nof War and Hunting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTENNA OF SERPULA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONICAL STOPPER.]\r\n\r\nWhen it withdraws itself, the Stopper closes the mouth of the tube with\r\nperfect exactness, so as to leave the inhabitant in safety. The reader\r\nwill see, on referring to the illustration, how exactly similar is the\r\nConical Stopper of Art to that of Nature, and how the inventor of that\r\narticle, as well as of the self-fitting candle, the candle-fixer, the\r\nblow-gun arrow, and the vent-peg, might have found prototypes of their\r\ninventions in Nature, if they had only known where to look for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FILTER.\r\n\r\nEven in a state of uncivilisation man has been driven to invent a Filter\r\nof some kind.\r\n\r\nThe simplest kind of Filter is that which is used by the Bosjesman\r\nwomen when procuring water for the use of their families. When, as often\r\nhappens, the only water to be obtained is to be found in muddy pools\r\nwhich have been trampled and perturbed by thirsty animals, the women\r\nhave recourse to a simple, though rather repulsive, expedient.\r\n\r\nEach woman is furnished with empty ostrich egg-shells by way of\r\nwater-vessels, and she also takes a couple of hollow reeds. Over the end\r\nof one of these reeds she ties a bundle of grass, and then plunges it as\r\ndeeply as she can into the mud. After a little while she sucks up the\r\nwater through the tube, the grass acting as a filter, and she then\r\ndischarges it by the second tube into the egg-shells. In this way the\r\nwomen will obtain water, where none but themselves could have procured\r\nit. As to the repulsive mode of obtaining it, no one can be fastidious\r\nwhen dying of thirst. Sir S. Baker mentions that when he was on his\r\ntravels he managed in a halt to save up enough water for a bath for\r\nhimself and his wife. He was about to throw away the soapy water, when\r\nthe vessel was snatched from his hands by two of his attendants, and the\r\ncontents eagerly drunk.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of the Filter which we use at the present day\r\nare too familiar to need description. Whether they be made principally\r\nof charcoal, which is a powerful disinfectant, or of merely stones,\r\ngravel, and sand, they are all constructed on the same principle,\r\nnamely, the straining out solid substances, and allowing only the pure\r\nwater to pass through the interstices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAS to the Filters of Nature, they are almost innumerable. In the first\r\nplace, the Earth itself is the primary filter of all, taking into itself\r\nall kinds of decomposing substances, separating them for the use of\r\nvegetation, and delivering the pure, bright, and sparkling spring water\r\nwhich we so highly and rightly value. The whole human body, again, is\r\npractically a collection of the most elaborate and effective filters\r\nthat the mind of man can conceive. But we will pass to the more obvious\r\nexamples of filters as seen in animal life.\r\n\r\nOn the upper left-hand portion of the illustration may be seen a long,\r\nfat, hairy creature, called popularly the Sea-mouse, and known to\r\nzoologists as _Aphrodite aculeata_. Although it inhabits the mud--and\r\nsea-mud is about as noisome a substance as can be imagined--it is\r\nclothed with a garment of such beauty that the rainbow itself can\r\nscarcely rival, and not surpass it. The hairs with which it is so\r\nprofusely covered glitter and sparkle with every imaginable hue, among\r\nwhich red and green seem to be predominant.\r\n\r\nThese hairs occupy the sides of the body, but in the upper surface there\r\nis a thick coating of felted hairs, interwoven with each other so\r\nclosely that they can with difficulty be separated. These hairs form a\r\nnatural filter, strain away the mud from the water, and allow the latter\r\nto pour itself upon the organs of respiration. If, therefore, a specimen\r\nbe examined when it is first brought up by the dredge, the felted hair\r\nwill always be found to contain a considerable amount of mud, and much\r\nwashing is needed before the creature can be introduced into an aquarium\r\nwhere the water is intended to be transparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APHRODITE. DUCK’S BEAK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILTER.]\r\n\r\nI may here mention that the name of Aphrodite is a singularly happy one.\r\nIt signifies something that arises from the foam of the sea, and was\r\ngiven to the goddess of beauty, because in the ancient myths she was\r\nsaid to have sprung from the foam of the sea. Unpoetical as it may\r\nappear, the German word Meerschaum, which is so familiar to us in\r\nconnection with pipes, is the exact equivalent of Aphrodite.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the Aphrodite is a figure representing the filtering apparatus\r\nwhich is found in the beak of the duck. This singularly beautiful\r\napparatus is well worthy of examination, and the more important details\r\nof its structure can easily be made out by the unassisted eye.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the upper half of the beak, or upper mandible, as\r\nit is scientifically called, is furnished along its edges with a row of\r\ncurved horny projections, very like the teeth of a comb, and each of\r\nthem coming to a point. There are some fifty or sixty of these teeth on\r\neach side, and they are regularly graduated in size, being longest in\r\nthe middle of the beak, and becoming very short at either end. They are\r\nset diagonally, with the tips pointing backwards. The edges of the lower\r\nmandible are turned up in a sort of fold, on the outside of which is a\r\nrow of grooves corresponding with the teeth of the upper mandible, and,\r\nlike them, being set diagonally.\r\n\r\nThese teeth and grooves would of themselves make a very efficient\r\nfilter, but they are further aided by the tongue. This is thick, fleshy,\r\nand very mobile; so much so, indeed, that when the mouth is opened the\r\ntongue is automatically thrust forward. The edges of the tongue are,\r\nlike those of the mandibles, furnished with a filtering apparatus.\r\nInstead, however, of being horny and stiff like those of the mandibles,\r\nthey are membranous and exceedingly delicate. Indeed, in order to see\r\nthem properly, it is necessary to place the tongue under water, so that\r\nthe membranous filaments shall be floated apart instead of clinging\r\ntogether by their own weight.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this apparatus is abundantly supplied with nerves, and is\r\nevidently a most exquisite instrument of touch. The reader will now\r\nunderstand the peculiar movements of a duck’s beak while feeding.\r\nAlthough the bird can and does eat solid food, such as barley, and, by\r\nreason of its superior width of beak, will very much defraud the poultry\r\nin a yard where ducks and hens are kept together, it is chiefly fitted\r\nfor extracting nourishment from water, and will find abundant\r\nsubsistence where a hen would die of starvation.\r\n\r\nWhen the beak is plunged into the water, the mandibles are rapidly\r\nopened and shut, the tongue incessantly working backwards and forwards\r\nbetween them. Consequently, not only are the solid parts of the water\r\nstrained between the comb of the upper beak and the grooves of the\r\nlower, but they undergo a further sifting or filtering from the delicate\r\nfibrils which fringe the edge of the tongue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER familiar example of the Filter is to be found in the jaw of the\r\nGreenland Whale. In this animal, as well as in its congeners, the\r\n“whalebone,” or “baleen,” as it is more properly called, is so formed\r\nthat it allows liquids to pass through it, while it retains solids.\r\nFeeding as it does upon small marine matters, it would starve but for\r\nthe filtering power of the baleen, which enables the animal to take into\r\nits vast mouth the sea-water with its inhabitants, and to expel the\r\nwater through the plates and fibres of the baleen, while retaining the\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe process of filtering, as well as the structure of the baleen, is so\r\nfamiliar that it does not need further description.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now proceed to another filter, which is used in the air, and not\r\nin water, namely, the Mouth-guard or Respirator of the fork-grinder.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no trade which is more destructive of human life than\r\nthat of the fork-grinder was until the peculiar respirator was made\r\nobligatory. The minute particles of steel thrown off by the grindstone\r\nfill the air, and were necessarily inhaled. Now, the human lungs are\r\ncapable of enduring very bad treatment, but the introduction of\r\nsteel-dust into them is more than they can bear. Consequently the\r\nduration of human life was very short, consumption almost invariably\r\nsetting in at an early age, and carrying off the men before they had\r\nachieved middle age.\r\n\r\nNor did the mischief end there. It was bad enough that life should be\r\nshortened, but far worse that it should be wasted, as was mostly the\r\ncase. The men, knowing what their fate must be, were simply reckless,\r\nand plunged into all kinds of debauchery, under the plea of “a short\r\nlife and a merry one.” They knew no better, and could scarcely be blamed\r\nfor their mode of living. And, as a matter of course, each succeeding\r\ngeneration was worse, smaller, and feebler than the preceding.\r\n\r\nThen there came the invention of the Magnetic Respirator, by which the\r\nfork-grinder’s trade was rendered as healthy as any other. It was made\r\nof steel-wire gauze, and magnetised, so that the floating particles of\r\nsteel were not only stopped in their progress to the lungs, but arrested\r\nby the magnetism, and, so to speak, taken prisoners by it.\r\n\r\nEven a well-made respirator of several layers, like those which are used\r\nby persons suffering from weak lungs, would have been useful, but the\r\naddition of magnetism doubled the efficacy while greatly diminishing the\r\ncost, a single layer of wire being quite adequate to the office, and\r\nwas, in fact, quite a stroke of genius.\r\n\r\nThe value of this invention is at once shown by the many complaints\r\nwhich the workmen made when the Respirator was first introduced. They\r\ncomplained that the apertures of the Respirator became so choked that\r\nthey could not breathe. This was perfectly true, but the complaint\r\nshowed the real value of the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIRACLE OF FLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESPIRATOR OF FORK-GRINDER.]\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for the workmen, every now and then, to clear off the\r\ninnumerable particles of steel which adhered to the magnetised wires,\r\nand impeded respiration. But they never seemed to realise the fact that,\r\nif it had not been for these wires, all the particles would have been\r\ndrawn into the lungs, and gradually choked them up, brought on\r\ninflammation, and extinguished their life altogether. And, with the\r\nusual repugnance to new ideas which is inherent in undeveloped minds,\r\nthe men stoutly resisted the introduction of the Respirator, and did\r\ntheir best to reject an invention which doubled the length of their\r\nlives, and enabled them to find long happiness in the world instead of\r\nbrief pleasure ended by sure and painful death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW, we will see how the principle of the Respirator is carried out in\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the illustration is drawn one of the most perfect\r\nRespirators, or air-filters, if we may use the term, that can be\r\nimagined. Perhaps some of my readers may know that insects do not\r\nbreathe as we do. They have no lungs, but their entire system is\r\npermeated by air-vessels, just as is our system with blood-vessels, and\r\ntherefore the air, instead of being restricted to the lungs, is conveyed\r\nto every part of the insect, the air-vessels extending to the very tips\r\nof the wings and antennæ, and to the claws of the feet.\r\n\r\nNeither does the insect receive the air through mouth or nostrils as we\r\ndo. Along the sides of the body are certain oval apertures called\r\n“spiracles,” from the Latin word _spiro_, which signifies breathing.\r\nThese spiracles can easily be seen by examining an ordinary silkworm.\r\nThey are situated in the soft and flexible skin which connects the rings\r\nor segments of which all insects are composed, and pass directly into\r\ntwo large air-tubes which run on either side of the body.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that since an insect is so thoroughly permeated with air,\r\nit must be furnished with means to render that air as pure as possible,\r\nand at all events to preserve the respiratory system from being choked\r\nwith dust or other adventitious substances.\r\n\r\nHow important the air is to an insect can easily be seen by dipping it\r\nin oil, or even brushing an oiled feather on its sides so as to fill up\r\nthe spiracles. A man under the hands of the hangman or garotter could\r\nnot die more swiftly, so much does an insect depend on air. In fact, an\r\ninsect is almost wholly composed of air-tubes, but for which the great\r\nthick-bodied dor-beetles could never use their organs of flight.\r\n\r\nOf course, although the spiracles can act as filters as far as the air\r\nis concerned, they cannot be analysts, and consequently insects are\r\npeculiarly sensitive to a bad atmosphere. There is, for example, the\r\nwell-known “laurel-bottle” of entomologists. A few young laurel-leaves\r\nare crushed and placed in a bottle. As soon as an insect is introduced,\r\nit breathes the prussic acid which is exhaled from the leaves, and at\r\nonce dies.\r\n\r\nSo it is with the more delicate “death-bottle,” into which a little\r\ncyanide of potassium is introduced, and covered with plaster of Paris.\r\nThe plaster prevents the poison from touching the insects and damaging\r\ntheir beautiful colours. It permits the deadly vapour to roll through\r\nits interstices; consequently, even the large-bodied moths, which are\r\ntenacious of life almost beyond credibility, can barely run round the\r\nbottle, when they roll over, and expire almost without a struggle, the\r\nvenomous atmosphere having saturated the entire body.\r\n\r\nAll entomologists know that the spiracles act as sieves, preventing any\r\nextraneous objects from gaining admission into the breathing-tubes. But,\r\nunless they have had personal experience, they cannot appreciate the\r\nefficacy of the spiracle when acting as a respirator. Even the\r\nmicroscope, though it may magnify the object to any extent, does not\r\nshow the wonderful filtering power of the spiracle. The figure in the\r\nillustration represents a spiracle of the common “blue-bottle” fly, and\r\nany one who wishes to examine such an object for himself can have but\r\nlittle difficulty in doing so, especially in the warm season of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nHow effectual is the barrier thus interposed by Nature between the\r\nexternal world and the interior of the insect may be inferred from the\r\nfollowing narrative:--\r\n\r\nMany years ago, while absorbed in the comparative anatomy of insect\r\nstructure, I believed myself to have hit upon a plan for injecting the\r\nminutest of tubes with mercury. So I took a male cockroach, placed a\r\nvessel of mercury in the receiver of an air-pump, and suspended the\r\ncockroach exactly over it. As the reader will fully have surmised, my\r\nidea was, first to exhaust the air from the inside of the insect, then\r\nto plunge it into the mercury, and then to admit the air, which, at a\r\npressure of fifteen pounds to the square inch, was likely to drive the\r\nmercury into the smallest of tubes. Such a plan was very successful with\r\nordinary tissues, and might succeed with insects.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I exhausted the air from the vessel in which the cockroach\r\nwas placed, and kept it in a state of exhaustion for a whole day, so as\r\nto prove that every particle of air was withdrawn from the insect. I\r\nthen plunged the cockroach deeply beneath the mercury, and admitted the\r\nair, hoping that the severe pressure would drive the mercury into the\r\nrespiratory vessels. But not one particle of the mercury could pass\r\nthrough the wonderful filter with which the cockroach had been provided,\r\nand, except that I had learned the power of the spiracle, I might have\r\nsaved both the time and trouble.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that, almost countless as are the species of\r\ninsects, no two of them possess exactly the same structure of the\r\nspiracles, the individuality being marked as clearly in these tiny\r\norgans as in the entire insect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF THE SPRING.--THE ELASTIC SPRING.--ACCUMULATORS.--THE\r\nSPIRAL SPRING.\r\n\r\n     Springs and their various Structure.--The Elastic Spring.--The\r\n     Boy’s Catapult and its Powers.--The Pistolograph, its Principle,\r\n     and Uses to which it can be put.--Leaf-rolling Caterpillars, and\r\n     their Way of Work.--The Carriage Spring.--The Horse’s Hoof and its\r\n     complex Structure.--Fungi and their united Power.--The Chinese\r\n     Cross-bow.--The ancient Balista.--Skull of the Crocodile.--Bones of\r\n     young Children.--The Spiral Spring and its many Uses.--The\r\n     Toy-gun.--The Needle-gun.--Valved Brass Instruments.--Watch and\r\n     Clock Springs.--The Bed Spring.--Parallels in Nature and\r\n     Art.--Buffers of Railway Carriages.--Spring Solitaires.--The Bell\r\n     Spring.--Spiral Springs in Vegetable Tissues.--Poison Cells of\r\n     various Marine Animals.--Effects of the Spiral Springs.\r\n\r\n\r\nELASTIC SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nHere we come upon a subject so large, that it is difficult to define its\r\nexact requisite limits. The principle of the elastic spring pervades all\r\nNature, and the numerous adaptations in Art are closely, though perhaps\r\nnot directly, attributable to the wide distribution of the spring in\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nThere is, for example, the simple elasticity which enables a tree, when\r\nbowed by the wind, to spring back so soon as the pressure is removed,\r\nand which, indeed, is the power which enables a bow to propel an arrow.\r\nThen there are spiral springs innumerable, many of them so minute that\r\nthey can only be seen by the aid of the microscope, and there are many\r\nsprings which exhibit their elasticity by their power of extension and\r\nshortening, just as is done with the elastic fabrics which are so much\r\nin vogue at the present day, and which seem so necessary to ordinary\r\ncomfort that we feel disposed to wonder how our forefathers managed\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to examine some of these springs in detail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is one form of elastic spring which has of late years become more\r\nfamiliar than agreeable, namely, the toy which is learnedly called a\r\n“catapult,” though it has little in common with the ancient weapon whose\r\nname it bears.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen by reference to the illustration, it consists of one or\r\nmore india-rubber straps attached to a fork-like handle, and carrying a\r\nsmall pouch in which is contained the missile. Although it is not\r\nremarkable for accuracy, it can throw a stone or a bullet a considerable\r\ndistance, and its power can be very quickly increased by adding to the\r\nnumber of the straps. Thus a catapult has been made which was capable of\r\nsending a small pistol bullet through a wooden board, so that the\r\nchild’s toy might really become a dangerous weapon.\r\n\r\nIndeed, cases are known where the catapult has hurled a stone with fatal\r\neffect upon human beings. In my own neighbourhood there are many\r\nexamples of glass being pierced by stones thrown from catapults just as\r\nif they had been subjected to bullets shot from firearms, the holes\r\nbeing quite small and round.\r\n\r\nThe power of accumulating force by increasing the number of springs was\r\nutilised by Mr. Scaife, when he invented his wonderful photographic\r\nmachine which he termed the “Pistolograph,” on account of the sound\r\nwhich was produced when the portrait was taken.\r\n\r\nThe idea was simple enough, though the practice of it was not so easy.\r\nHe wished to be able to take a photograph with an exposure of the least\r\npossible time, and thus to attain freedom and action, instead of the\r\ndull stiffness which generally characterizes photograph portraits. The\r\nmode which he adopted was by introducing a peculiarly sensitive film,\r\nwhich would take an impression in a mere moment, and then arranging the\r\nmachine so that an exposure of more than a moment was impossible.\r\n\r\nThis was done by covering the lens with an exactly fitting door,\r\nrevolving on a pivot. The axis on which the door revolved was attached\r\nto a number of india-rubber bands, exactly like those which are used for\r\nconfining papers. As the power of the springs increased with their\r\nnumber, it naturally followed that the rapidity of the revolution was in\r\nexact ratio with the number of the bands, so that the duration of\r\nexposure to light could be measured with tolerable accuracy.\r\n\r\nSo wonderfully well did this plan succeed that photographs of eclipses\r\nwere taken with perfect accuracy, a matter of great importance when time\r\nhas to be considered. Horses were also taken at full gallop, so as to\r\ndisplay their action, and the crowning achievement was the photographing\r\nof a cannon in the act of firing, and the bursting of a charged shell.\r\nSo rapid is the action of the instrument, that in several cases where a\r\ncannon or mortar had been photographed, even the track of the ball or\r\nshell is visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAF-ROLLING NESTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATAPULT.]\r\n\r\nIt necessarily followed that when the springs caused the circular cover\r\nto revolve with such rapidity, they made it close with a sharp report,\r\nand so gave rise to the name of the machine. Moreover, as it had to be\r\nused for rapidly moving objects, it was not fixed on a pedestal, but was\r\nheld in the hands, while aim was taken at the object, just as with a\r\npistol. When the observer thought that he had his aim correct, he\r\ntouched a trigger, round spun the cover, and the photograph was taken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the right hand of the illustration is seen the Catapult, made with\r\nseveral springs, and on the left is shown an example of the Accumulator\r\nas formed by Nature.\r\n\r\nThe reader may probably be acquainted with the Leaf-rolling\r\nCaterpillars, of which there are so many. I had often inspected these\r\ncurled leaves, and, on comparing them with the size of the\r\ncaterpillars, had noticed that the muscular strength of the insect was\r\nquite inadequate to the work which was done. That much of it was owing\r\nto the “bowsing” system, which has already been described when treating\r\nof the Toggle-joint, was very probable, but that some other force must\r\nbe employed was evident.\r\n\r\nOn unrolling a leaf, the hidden force was at once explained, and showed\r\nitself to be a system of accumulators exactly like those of the\r\npistolograph or the catapult. The caterpillar spins successive belts of\r\nsilken threads, and affixes them to the leaf, as shown in the\r\nillustration. These threads are nearly as elastic as the india-rubber\r\nbands of the catapult, and accordingly draw the leaf together. Another\r\nset of belts is added above the former, and, as they harden and contract\r\nin the air, they roll the leaf still further. The first row is then\r\nshortened and tightened, and a third and fourth row are added in the\r\nsame fashion. So elastic are these belts, that if the leaf be carefully\r\nhandled it can be almost wholly unrolled, and will spring back again as\r\nsoon as the force is removed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER form of accumulated force may be seen in the ordinary Carriage\r\nSpring, one of which is shown in the illustration. It is made of a\r\nnumber of strips of elastic steel lying upon each other, and suffered to\r\nplay upon each other by means of slots and rivets. The weight being\r\nplaced in the centre, it is evident that this very ingenious spring is\r\nreally an elastic girder, yielding to sudden pressure, and recovering\r\nitself when that pressure is removed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINGENIOUS as is this spring, it has many parallels in Nature, one of\r\nwhich is here given.\r\n\r\nIt is popularly thought the hoof of the horse is a solid mass of horn\r\ndestined to protect the feet against hard and rough ground. Such\r\ncertainly seems to be the opinion of farriers, who, in shoeing horses,\r\nact exactly as if the horn of the hoof were structureless; whereas it is\r\na marvel of complicated mechanism. On looking at the exterior of a\r\nhorse’s hoof, it will be seen to be marked with a vast number of very\r\nfine, but easily visible longitudinal lines, looking as if they were\r\nscratches from a very fine needle. If the hoof be removed from the\r\nfoot, and examined upon the interior, it will be seen that each of the\r\napparent scratches signifies the edge of a very thin plate of horn, not\r\nso thick as the paper on which this book is printed. The hoof, in fact,\r\nis built up of multitudinous plates of horn, set side by side, and each\r\nacting as a separate spring. It is this beautiful structure which allows\r\nthe horse to tread without a jar being sent through its whole system by\r\nevery step which it takes.\r\n\r\nA similar structure is to be found in all hoofed quadrupeds, and is\r\nespecially noticeable in the case of the Elephant. All those who have\r\nwatched the walk of an Elephant, no matter what its size may be, must\r\nhave been struck with the curious noiselessness of its movements. Its\r\nweight may be measured by tons, and yet the enormous animal steps as\r\nnoiselessly as a cat. On examining one of the hoofs, after it is removed\r\nfrom the foot, the cause of this marvellously silent tread is perfectly\r\nevident. The whole of the hoof is composed of nearly parallel horny\r\nplates, and by their united action they produce the required result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSE-HOOF.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARRIAGE SPRING.]\r\n\r\nEach plate in itself is very feeble, but, when united as they are at the\r\nends, they afford mutual support to each other. Similarly the separate\r\nfeathers in a couch would be crushed by a comparatively slight weight,\r\nbut when a number are confined together they support each other, and\r\nform the soft, yielding couch with which we are so familiar. Horsehair,\r\nwhen used as the stuffing for a couch or chair, acts in the same way,\r\nand so do the fine filaments of wool when used under the name of\r\n“flock.”\r\n\r\nAnother good example of the power of accumulated force, although it has\r\nno direct relation to the spring, is the well-known fact that fungi,\r\nwhich are separately so fragile, are capable of lifting and retaining in\r\nthe air stones so large that two men could hardly carry them. Were the\r\nstones laid down upon the fungi, the latter would be crushed, but, as\r\nthey grow beneath the stones, they accumulate their powers, and slowly,\r\nbut certainly, raise the weight from the ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHIS very principle of accumulated force has long been used in weapons\r\nof war, and I possess several examples of such weapons. One of them is a\r\nChinese repeating Cross-bow, which was taken at the capture of the Peiho\r\nFort, and was really a formidable wall-instrument, carrying a reserve of\r\narrows, and delivering them with great rapidity. In point of fact, it\r\nconsists of three bows, placed upon each other, and playing upon each\r\nother just as do the portions of a carriage spring. Such strength is\r\nthus obtained, that the bow cannot be drawn by hand, but is worked with\r\na lever, as shown in the illustration. The whole machinery of the\r\nweapon, including the self-notching and self-supplying system, is very\r\ninteresting, but is outside our present object. The very powerful bow of\r\nthe ancient Balista was made on the same principle, and was strong\r\nenough to throw large stones and wooden beams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAWS OF CROCODILE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE CROSS-BOW.]\r\n\r\nI also have bows in my collection which are strengthened on the same\r\nprinciple, though not exactly in the same manner. There are several\r\nIndian, Chinese, and Japanese bows which are curved almost like the\r\nletter C, and have to be reversed when strung. These bows are of no very\r\ngreat size, but possess wonderful elasticity. They owe the latter\r\nquality to sundry layers of sinew which have been affixed to the back\r\nwhen wet, and which add enormously to the power of the bow, while they\r\nvery little enlarge its dimensions.\r\n\r\nAnother bow, made by the natives of Vancouver’s Island, has the back\r\nstrengthened by a number of cords spun from sinew fibres, and possessing\r\nthe strength and elasticity to which we are accustomed in the strings of\r\nthe harp, guitar, or violin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now turn to a parallel in Nature. This is to be found in the\r\nlower jaw of the Crocodile, as is pointed out by Professor Owen, in his\r\nwork on the “Skeleton and the Teeth.”\r\n\r\nAll persons who have a smattering of anatomy are aware that even in the\r\nhuman body the most solid bones of the adult were originally composed of\r\nseveral pieces, and that they only become fused together in course of\r\ntime. The jaw-bones, for example, were once so composed, and in the\r\nCrocodile the junction is never completed, the pieces of bone remaining\r\nseparate, but being pressed firmly against each other during life.\r\n\r\nI have now before me the skull of a Gangetic Crocodile, in which,\r\nalthough the animal was an adult when killed, the bones of the long\r\nlower jaw are so loose that unless they were tied together the jaw would\r\nfall to pieces.\r\n\r\nThis analogy between Art and Nature is thus described by Professor Owen\r\nin the work which has just been mentioned:--\r\n\r\n“The purpose of this subdivision of the lower jaw-bone has been well\r\nexplained by Conybeare and Buckland, by the analogy of its structure to\r\nthat adopted in binding together several parallel plates of elastic wood\r\nor steel to make a crossbow, and also in setting together thin plates of\r\nsteel in the carriage spring.”\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland also adds: “Those who have witnessed the shock given to the\r\nhead of a Crocodile by the act of snapping together its thin, long jaws,\r\nmust have seen how liable to fracture the lower jaw would be were it\r\ncomposed of one bone only.... The splicing and bracing together of thin\r\nflat bones of unequal length and of varying thickness afford\r\ncompensation for the weakness and risk of fracture that would otherwise\r\nhave attended the elongation of the parts.”\r\n\r\nA good example of the value of this structure of bone may be found in\r\nyoung children. Before they are old enough to take care of themselves\r\nthey are perpetually falling down, and never hurting themselves. I have\r\nseen a little girl of five years old roll from top to bottom of a lofty\r\nstaircase. It looked as if the child must be killed, but she was only\r\ngiddy with her many revolutions, and a little bruised about the elbows.\r\nThe reason of this curious immunity from injury is, that the bones,\r\nespecially those of the skull, are not completely united, and so act on\r\nthe principle of the compound spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRAL SPRING.\r\n\r\nThis subject is so large, and there are so many examples, both in Art\r\nand Nature, that it is not very easy to make selections which will\r\nsufficiently answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER-LILY. LILY. POISON-CELL OF HELIANTHOID.\r\nANTHEROZOIDS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIRAL SPRING. BED SPRING. WATCH SPRING.]\r\n\r\nThe upper left-hand figure of the illustration represents the ordinary\r\nSpiral Spring made of wire, and used for its power of resuming its shape\r\nwhen compressed. In early childhood most boys have had practical\r\nexperience of this spring in the toy guns and cannons with which they\r\nare supplied. The spring is compressed by the ramrod, and held in its\r\nplace by a catch. If a pellet be placed in the gun, and the catch\r\nreleased by pulling the trigger, the spring flies back to its former\r\nshape, and drives the pellet.\r\n\r\nAn exactly similar spring is used in the well-known “Needle-gun,” the\r\nspring driving a needle through the explosive mixture, and so igniting\r\nthe charge.\r\n\r\nOur brass instruments would be very badly off without the spiral spring,\r\nwhich is placed under the pistons. The elasticity allows the pistons to\r\nbe pressed down, and when the fingers are raised the pistons spring up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnother form of this instrument is seen on the right of the ordinary\r\nspring. This is used in the manufacture of spring mattresses and\r\ncouches, and is made thinner in the centre, so as to allow of greater\r\nelasticity.\r\n\r\nBelow them is the spring which is used for watches and clocks, one end\r\nbeing fastened to the rim of the barrel, and the other to the pivot.\r\nWhen the latter is turned the spring becomes “wound up,” and, when\r\nreleased, keeps the works going by pressing against them. Of the\r\n“pall-and-ratchet” wheel, by which the movements are retarded, we shall\r\ntreat in another place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration are a few figures of the Spiral\r\nSpring as seen in Nature.\r\n\r\nOn the extreme left of the group is a spiral cell taken from the\r\nflower-stem of the Water-lily. As the reader will see, it is composed of\r\na number of fibres laid parallel to each other, and twisted into a\r\nhollow spiral. In order to exhibit its shape the better, the spiral has\r\nbeen partially uncoiled.\r\n\r\nOn the extreme right is a corresponding spiral cell from the common\r\nLily, in which the spring power is given by two fibres twisted in\r\nopposite directions. The reader will now understand and admire the\r\nmechanism by which these plants attain their great strength and\r\nelasticity, the stems being made of myriads of these spiral fibres.\r\n\r\nThe oval body on the upper part of the illustration is a poison-cell of\r\na marine polyp, and is given here as an example of an animal spiral\r\nspring, the others all belonging to the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nWe shall see more of its structure a little further on, and will not now\r\nexamine it in detail.\r\n\r\nThe two remaining figures represent the remarkable objects called\r\nAntherozoids, _i.e._ the living creatures of anthers. They exist in vast\r\nnumbers in the non-flowering plants, and inhabit those parts which\r\ncorrespond with the anthers of the flowering plants. When placed in\r\nwater they have a curious way of coiling and twisting themselves\r\nspirally, so as to make their way through the water in a tortuous, but\r\ntolerably rapid, course. This movement is effected by the contraction\r\nand expansion of the spirally twisted filament. The upper figure\r\nrepresents a group of Antherozoids in their cells, and the lower is a\r\nmuch more magnified figure of a single Antherozoid as it appears when\r\nfree, and in the act of moving through the water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the accompanying illustration are many examples of Spiral Springs,\r\nboth natural and artificial. We will take these in their order.\r\n\r\nThe upper left-hand figure represents the “Buffer,” by which the\r\ncarriages of railway trains are prevented from jarring against each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may be old enough to remember the days of the\r\nold railway carriages that were connected by short chains, and furnished\r\nwith buffers that were merely padded. As the train started a separate\r\njerk was given to every carriage by the tightening of the chains, and,\r\nas it stopped, all the carriages bumped against each other in a most\r\nunpleasant manner. Now, however, the buffers are furnished with powerful\r\nsprings, and are pressed strongly against each other by means of\r\nscrew-bolts, so that they form one continuous line.\r\n\r\nIn fact--and here is another analogy between Art and Nature--a train,\r\nwhen properly made up, bears a close resemblance to a human spine, the\r\ncarriages being analogous to the vertebræ, and the spring buffers to the\r\nelastic cartilages between the vertebræ.\r\n\r\nNowadays, owing to this arrangement, the whole train moves together, and\r\ncan be started and stopped so gently that the passengers are hardly\r\naware of movement or stoppage. For example, one of my friends was in a\r\ntrain which came into collision with some obstacle. The carriages in\r\nfront were dashed to pieces, and several of the passengers killed. His\r\ncarriage, however, which was nearly at the end of the train, and had the\r\nbenefit of all the springs, was hardly shaken, and the inmates did not\r\nknow for some little time that an accident had occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBUFFER OF RAILWAY ENGINE. MOSS DISCHARGING SPORES.\r\nSUPPORTING SPRING OF RAILWAY CARRIAGE. TENTACLE, WITH SPRINGS.\r\nSPRING SOLITAIRE. SPRING-CELL OF MADREPORE. SPRING-THREAD OF\r\nSEA-ANEMONE. SPRING-CELL OF CORYNACTIS.\r\nBELL SPRING.]\r\n\r\nBelow the buffer is a Wheel Spring, made exactly on the same principle,\r\nbut set perpendicularly instead of horizontally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE two figures beneath the wheel spring represent an object very\r\nfamiliar to us, namely, a Spring Solitaire, one figure showing it as\r\nopen, and the other as closed. In this article the clasp is held in its\r\nplace by a spring, and is only released by pressure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the solitaire is a very prosaic application of the Spiral Spring,\r\nnamely, that by which a house-bell is kept in vibration after the force\r\nof the pull has ceased, and which renders the bell, as Dickens happily\r\nremarks, so greedy to ring after it has been pulled.\r\n\r\nI made and employed a spring of a similar character in closing the door\r\nof my parrot’s cage. Polly is a wonderfully clever bird, and a capital\r\ntalker. First, she had a cage with upright bars, two of which could be\r\nslid upwards by way of a door. She soon found out the trick of the bars,\r\nand used to escape, carefully replacing the bars afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhen she was transferred to a metal cage, she discovered that the door\r\nslid upwards, and began at her old tricks. So I took a piece of\r\ngalvanised iron wire, coiled it into a spiral spring, fastened one end\r\nto the upper part of the door, and the other by a hook to a staple at\r\nthe bottom of the cage. Consequently, when Polly lifted the door, and\r\nloosened her grip for a fresh hold, the door closed itself again. So,\r\nafter awhile, Polly gave up the door, and now never tries to open it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSING to the upper right-hand corner of the illustration, there is\r\nshown a portion of Moss as it appears when magnified, and discharging\r\nits spores. When they are ripe a vast number of little spiral springs\r\nare let loose, and shoot the sporules into the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the moss are four figures, which are, in fact, the same object\r\ndifferently magnified, and seen from different points of view. These\r\npeculiar organs are technically termed “cnidæ,” from a Greek word which\r\nsignifies a nettle. The appropriateness of the name we shall presently\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that the tentacles of various marine animals\r\nare furnished with poison-cells. The object of these cells is to\r\ncapture and kill the prey, and the mode of doing so is very remarkable.\r\n\r\nOn the right and left of the illustration are two such bodies, in which\r\nis seen a sort of elastic wire coiled spirally, apparently without\r\nregularity, but really possessing a most beautiful order. That on the\r\nleft is the poison-cell of a Madrepore, and the other is the same organ\r\nin a Corynactis. No sooner is the tentacle touched than the poison-cells\r\nare mechanically acted upon. They are turned inside out, and the coiled\r\nspring darts forth with wonderful violence.\r\n\r\nSlight as is the dart, so fine that it cannot be seen except with the\r\naid of a tolerably powerful microscope, it is a terrible weapon.\r\nAlthough it is projected with sufficient force to bury itself to its\r\nbase even through so tough an object as the human skin, it could inflict\r\nbut little injury, and would, indeed, scarcely be felt. But it carries\r\nwith it a most irritant poison, which is apparently contained in the\r\nlittle capsule. These cnidæ are very plentiful in the tentacles of the\r\nStinging Jelly-fish, or Stanger, as it is often called, and are charged\r\nwith a terrible poison.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all such poisons, its effects differ according to\r\nthe constitution of the being that is poisoned. There are some persons,\r\nfor example, who care no more for the sting of a bee than for the prick\r\nof a needle, and there are those whom a single bee-sting will bring\r\nalmost to the gates of death. So with the tentacles of the Stinging\r\nJelly-fish and those of the Portuguese Man-of-war, and there are persons\r\nwho are scarcely affected with the sting of the scorpion.\r\n\r\nSo it is with nettles. When I was a boy at school it was thought\r\nnecessary to wear an oak-leaf, or at least a portion of an oak-leaf, on\r\nthe 29th of May, and all who did not possess this talisman might be\r\nflogged with nettles by those who did. As the school was situated in the\r\nnorth of England, where the oak puts forth its leaves late in the\r\nseason, it was no easy matter to obtain a veritable oak-leaf, and we\r\nused to take any leaf that we could procure, and cut it round the edges\r\ninto the similitude of a suitable oak-leaf.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the nettles upon the boys was most curiously diversified.\r\nSome cared nothing whatever for them; others suffered sharp but brief\r\npangs; while others, of whom I was one, endured the most lancinating\r\npain at the time, and for hours afterwards a hot, burning, fevered skin,\r\nand a heavy, dull ache, accompanied by throbbings of the brain so\r\nviolent that it appeared as if the head would burst asunder at every\r\nheart-beat.\r\n\r\nThe fact of this inequality has been throughout life a valuable lesson\r\nto me, _i.e._ that a punishment which will nearly, if not quite, kill\r\none man, will be no punishment at all to another.\r\n\r\nOf course I cannot answer for the effects of these very minute cnidæ\r\nupon others, but I can state that they nearly killed _me_, and that if I\r\nhad been forced to swim another hundred yards, I should have collapsed,\r\nsunk, and had a coroner’s jury return a verdict of “Found drowned in\r\nconsequence of cramp.”\r\n\r\nOn me the effects were as follows:--First a slight, and then a severe,\r\ntingling on the parts which had been struck. Then sharp, darting pangs.\r\nThen a sudden shock as if a bullet had passed through the breast from\r\none side to the other. Consequent collapse, and suspension of the office\r\nof both heart and lungs. I once had to walk nearly two miles after being\r\nstung by one of these dread animals, and how often I fell before\r\nreaching my lodgings I dare not say, but certainly once in every two\r\nhundred yards.\r\n\r\nEven after partial recovery I should not have known my own face. It was\r\nthat of an old and wearied man of seventy, grey, wrinkled, and withered;\r\nand many months elapsed before I felt myself sure that the weird-like\r\nbullet would not drive through my breast, and leave me lying on the\r\nground gasping and speechless.\r\n\r\nThese dreaded tentacles can sting as fiercely when separated from the\r\nanimal as when they are conjoined to it, as I can also testify from\r\npersonal experience.\r\n\r\nI have a natural alacrity in damaging myself, and there is scarcely a\r\nrepresentative bone in the body that I have not fractured or dislocated,\r\nor both. Fortunately the cerebral vertebræ have hitherto escaped. I have\r\nbroken the right leg, right arm, two ribs, and right collar-bone;\r\ndislocated the right ankle, and smashed nearly every bone of the right\r\nhand. At present, the damage to the left side is restricted to two ribs;\r\nand I hope that the Genius of Ossifraction may now be content with his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut I equally seem to have a natural affinity for the tentacles of the\r\nStangers, which deliver their envenomed darts just as fiercely when they\r\nare separated from the Medusa as when they are connected with it.\r\n\r\nA curious example of this fact befell me in the present year (1875).\r\nSeeing that there had been a steady southern gale, which made Lundy\r\nIsland and Hartland and Baggy Points indiscernible, I dreaded my old\r\nfoes, and, instead of bathing from the “Pebble Ridge,” took to the great\r\n“Nassau” Baths at Westward Ho. I sadly missed the roll of the waves, and\r\nthe placid rapture of lying with outspread arms as the vast Atlantic\r\nbillows came rolling in, flinging up the great grey boulders as if they\r\nwere corks, and letting them roll down the ridge again with a\r\nthundering, and yet soothing, sound. Three miles or more inland may the\r\nthunder of the Pebble Ridge be heard; and at night, even though a storm\r\nbe raging, tearing the leaves off the trees in whirling showers,\r\nflinging great branches into the air like ostrich plumes, and howling so\r\nthat one person can hardly hear another speak, the dull, low, continuous\r\nthunder of the Pebble Ridge is heard over all. I have often remained\r\nawake at Bideford, simply on account of the deep roar of the Pebble\r\nRidge, as the rising tide rolled its vast waves along the coast from\r\nBaggy Point, through Westward Ho and Clovelly, to Hartland.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a heavy sea, the “undertow” of these waves is so great\r\nthat even had no such things as Stangers existed, I should not have\r\nventured upon the Pebble Ridge. One of my friends, a strong swimmer, was\r\nnearly drowned off that ridge by the undertow; and not long before I\r\nvisited Westward Ho a promising young man lost his life within a few\r\nyards of that treacherous shore.\r\n\r\nMuch against my will, I went to the new bath, which is always supplied\r\nwith a running current of sea-water; and I had hardly swum the length of\r\nthe bath before I felt the familiar nettle-like sting in my foot.\r\nFortunately it was only caused by a small fragment of a Stanger’s\r\ntentacle, which had been severed from the animal and pumped into the\r\nbath, and no harm ensued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSPIRAL AND RINGED TISSUES.--VARIOUS SPRINGS IN NATURE AND ART.\r\n\r\n     Spiral Tissues, and their Structure and Uses.--The movable\r\n     Gas-lamp.--Elastic Tubes.--Breathing-tubes of Insects, and their\r\n     Spiral Wire.--Ringed Tissues and their varied Structure.--Ringed\r\n     Tissues applied to modern Dress.--Chinese and Japanese\r\n     Lanterns.--Proboscis of the House-fly.--Trachea of various\r\n     Animals.--Mutual Tendency of Rings and Spirals towards each\r\n     other.--Fibres of the Yew-tree.--Diving and Divers.--Principle of\r\n     the Diving-bell.--How it is supplied with Air.--Structure of the\r\n     Air-tubes.--Nests of the Water-spider.--Diving by means of\r\n     Tubes.--Larva of the Drone-fly, and its Mode of breathing.--How to\r\n     examine them.--Leaping Springs.--The Skip-jack in Nature and\r\n     Art.--Skip-jack or Click Beetles.--The Spring-tail, Grasshopper,\r\n     Kangaroo, Gerboa, and other Jumping Creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRAL AND RINGED TISSUES.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the Spiral Tissue under another aspect, _i.e._\r\nthat of acting as the internal support of an exterior membrane. Ringed\r\ntissues are necessarily conjoined with the Spiral, as they both\r\ndischarge the same office, and in some cases merge almost imperceptibly\r\ninto each other in the same specimens. This is most beautifully shown in\r\nthe proboscis of the common House-fly, to which reference will presently\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nThe subject is so large that only a comparatively small selection of\r\nexamples can be made, the greater number belonging to Nature, and not to\r\nArt.\r\n\r\nWe will first take the common movable Gas-lamp, with its accompanying\r\ntube. It is at present the tube of which we have to treat, the gas\r\nitself being reserved for a future page.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that, in order to enable the lamp to be moved from one\r\nspot to another, the tube through which the gas passes must be so\r\nconstructed that if it be bent, or even coiled, it retains its form, and\r\ndoes not become flattened. In order to obtain this object, a very long\r\nthin wire is coiled spirally to a suitable length. Over this wire is\r\nsewn the casing of the tube, which is afterwards made waterproof with\r\nelastic varnish. A still simpler mode is by enclosing a spiral wire\r\nwithin a tube of vulcanised india-rubber. It will be seen, then, that by\r\nthe elasticity of the spiral wire the tube must always retain its shape,\r\nno matter how much it may be bent.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration are shown the movable Gas-lamp and\r\ntube, and a portion of the latter is given with its spiral wire\r\npartially unwound, in order to show its structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRACHEA OF INSECT, WITH ITS SPIRAL THREAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUBE OF GAS-LAMP, WITH ITS SPIRAL WIRE.]\r\n\r\nThe large tubes which convey air to divers are made in the same manner,\r\nas they would not only succumb to the pressure of the water without the\r\nwire, but could not be dragged over obstacles or round corners without\r\ncollapsing. It often happens that a diver is obliged, when surveying a\r\nsunken ship, to traverse the whole of her interior, descending ladder\r\nafter ladder, and entering every cabin in the ship. This could not be\r\ndone but for the internal coil of wire within the tube. Reference will\r\npresently be made to the subject of diving.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand is seen an object that looks something like a branch\r\nhollowed very thin. It is a magnified view of part of the Trachea or\r\nbreathing-tube through which air is conveyed into the system of an\r\ninsect. These breathing-tubes ramify to every portion of the body of an\r\ninsect, even penetrating to the extremities of the antennæ, the wings,\r\nand the legs. It is obvious that as these organs are in tolerably\r\nconstant movement, and the legs are much bent at every joint by the\r\naction of walking, the air-tubes which run through them must possess the\r\nsame qualities as those of the gas-lamp and diver.\r\n\r\nIf one of these tracheæ be removed and placed under the microscope, it\r\nwill be seen to be constructed in a manner exactly similar to that which\r\nhas been described. Within the membrane which forms the tube proper\r\nthere is a very fine, but very strong thread, which is coiled exactly\r\nlike the wire spring. It is not attached to the membrane, and so strong\r\nis it that, although it is all but invisible to the naked eye, it can be\r\ndrawn out as shown in the left-hand figure of the illustration. If laid\r\non a piece of glass, it immediately tries to recoil itself, and for some\r\nlittle time will twist and curl about as if it were alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRACHEA OF DRAGON-FLY LARVA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUBE OF HOOKAH.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the above illustration are two similar examples of the spiral thread\r\nwith a flexible tube. The right-hand figure represents one of the many\r\nforms of the water-pipe, whether known as Hookah, Narghile, or\r\nHubble-bubble. In the simpler forms of this pipe, such as the latter,\r\nthe inhaling-tube is quite straight, and the bowl is held in the hands\r\nof the smoker. In the more refined pipe, however, the tube is very long,\r\nflexible, and made elastic by an inner spiral wire.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may remember that the larva of the Dragon-fly is a\r\nmost remarkable creature in consequence of its methods of propulsion\r\nand respiration. The water is taken into the interior of the body\r\nthrough a peculiarly formed aperture, and then ejected with such\r\nviolence as to drive the body forward on the same principle as that\r\nwhich causes a rocket to ascend.\r\n\r\nThe figure on the left hand of the illustration is a representation of\r\nthe abdomen of this larva rather magnified, and opened so as to show the\r\ninterior. On either side run the two principal breathing-tubes, through\r\nthe delicate membranes of which the spiral thread can plainly be seen.\r\n\r\nThese tubes are connected with a smaller set, and they with a still\r\nsmaller, so that at last they are of such tenuity that they can scarcely\r\nbe distinguished without the use of a glass. But, however small they may\r\nbe, they are always fitted with the spiral thread.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to the cases where the membrane is supported by a series of\r\nrings, and not by a single spiral wire.\r\n\r\nIn the right-hand division of the illustration are two specimens of\r\nobjects which shall be nameless, but which were drawn per special favour\r\nat a milliner’s shop. Although the day has now happily gone by when the\r\nlarger object was in general wear, and seemed to be irrepressively\r\nincreasing in dimensions, certain modifications of it, under various\r\nnames, have made their appearance in almost every book of fashions and\r\nevery large milliner’s shop.\r\n\r\nHere we have the external membrane made of linen, calico, merino, or\r\nsimilar material, distended by a number of elastic rings set at\r\ntolerably even distances from each other.\r\n\r\nThe two small objects represent the handy little paper lanterns so\r\ncommon in China and Japan. They are composed of an external coat of\r\ntough tissue paper, so thin that it allows the light to pass through it\r\nwith tolerable freedom, and of an internal series of elastic rings,\r\nwhich not only support it and preserve its cylindrical shape, but allow\r\nit to be folded up flat when not wanted.\r\n\r\nI possess a singularly ingenious lantern of this kind, made in Japan,\r\nand displaying the thoroughness of work which characterizes that nation.\r\nIt is five inches in diameter, and the lantern itself is affixed at\r\neither end to a circular wooden cap the upper fitting over the lower.\r\nConsequently, when the lantern is shut, it is entirely enclosed between\r\nthese two caps, which effectually preserve it from harm. It is\r\ndelicately finished, and has no less than thirty rings, made of very\r\nnarrow strips of bamboo. The upper cap has a little trap-door through\r\nwhich the candle can be admitted and trimmed, and in its centre is a\r\nsmall round hole for the passage of air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the left-hand division of the illustration are shown several examples\r\nof ringed and spiral tissues belonging to the vegetable world, in which\r\nthe principle is exactly the same as that of the Chinese lantern, &c.\r\nThat on the right hand is an example of simple rings within a membrane.\r\nThe central figure shows a double spiral, which produces very much the\r\nappearance of a series of rings; and on the extreme left is an\r\ninteresting example which shows the transition in the internal supports\r\nfrom spirals to rings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIRAL AND RINGED FIBRE (VEGETABLE).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAMELESS OBJECTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPER LANTERNS.]\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that the proboscis of the House-fly exhibits\r\nthis modification. If one of these objects be placed under a moderate\r\npower microscope--the half-inch is quite enough--and examined, it will\r\nbe seen that there are some large tracheæ, just like those of the\r\nDragon-fly larva, on each side of the proboscis, and that, where the end\r\nis widened and flattened into a sort of disc, their place is taken by a\r\nset of very much smaller tracheæ, coming nearly to a point, and each\r\nbeing supported internally by a series of incomplete rings, shaped very\r\nmuch like the letter C. A slide containing this object well mounted can\r\nbe purchased at any optician’s for a shilling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE trachea, or windpipe, as we call it, of all vertebrate animals, man\r\nincluded, is formed on exactly the same principle, as any one may see by\r\ngoing to a butcher’s shop, and looking at the trachea, or windpipe, by\r\nwhich the lungs, or “lights,” as they are called, are suspended. Were it\r\nnot for this structure, we should not be able to bend our necks or turn\r\nour heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OX.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIG.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOOSE.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows the tracheæ of three well-known\r\ncreatures. The left-hand figure is the trachea of an Ox, the central\r\nfigure that of a Pig, and the right-hand figure that of a Goose. Mr.\r\nTuffen West, who made the drawings, sent with them the following\r\nremarks:--\r\n\r\n“The tracheæ of animals furnish some very interesting examples of\r\nvariation in the form and arrangement of the rings. Their purpose,\r\nperhaps, one can but guess at in some cases; but doubtless, as being\r\nworks of the Master Builder, careful study would be repaid.\r\n\r\n“In the Ox the rings are very strong and close, and in form like a\r\nhorse-shoe with the ends approximated.\r\n\r\n“In the Pig the incomplete rings are broad at one part, and narrow on\r\nthe opposite side, with a tendency to spiral arrangement. I imagine that\r\nthis would make a very rigid tube, and, indeed, it feels so in the hand.\r\n\r\n“Then, in the Goose, the narrowed lower part is that which is figured\r\njust before the trachea reaches the sternum. The (complete) rings are\r\ntwice as broad in one half as in the other, and by the alternate\r\ndisposition of these differing widths, a tube is formed of great\r\nflexibility fore and aft, but almost absolutely rigid in the lateral\r\ndirection. This seems to be so marked an evidence of design as to be\r\ncalculated to greatly raise our admiration.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RINGED TISSUES OF SUGAR-CANE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE SPIRAL TISSUES TENDING TO RINGS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE have seen several examples of ringed tissues tending to the spiral\r\nform, and it is but natural that we should expect to find spiral tissues\r\ntending to the ring.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration the two left-hand figures represent the\r\ncuriously modified ringed tissue which is to be found in the sugar-cane,\r\nthe left-hand figure being much more magnified than the other.\r\n\r\nThe other figures represent four examples of vegetable spiral tissues,\r\nin which it will be seen that there is a tendency to form rings, and\r\nthat if a number of rings were substituted for the spiral, and the\r\nobject viewed in a slanting direction, it would be almost impossible to\r\ndistinguish between the ring and the spiral.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable of these examples are the two right-hand\r\nfigures. That on the extreme right represents a spiral vessel taken from\r\nthe so-called root, or “rhizome,” of the Water-lily, and the other is a\r\nsimilar vessel taken from a branch of the Yew-tree. It has been\r\nsuggested that to this spiral structure is due the proverbial elasticity\r\nof the yew-tree, which has from time immemorial rendered it the best\r\nwood for the manufacture of bows.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVING AND DIVERS.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that the flexible tubes used by modern\r\ndivers are constructed on the model of several structures belonging to\r\nthe animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\nWe will now see how they are utilised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the earlier stages of the diver’s art the Diving-bell afforded the\r\nonly means of gaining access to the bed of the sea, even in\r\ncomparatively shallow waters. The mode in which this result was obtained\r\nwas simple enough, and though it carried with it the germs of still\r\ngreater improvements, was but limited and uncertain in its action.\r\n\r\nThe reader is probably aware that if a vessel be filled with air, no\r\nliquid can obtain admittance until a corresponding amount of air be set\r\nfree. Suppose, for example, that an empty tumbler be inserted over a\r\nbasin of very clean water, and pressed downwards, it will be found that\r\nscarcely any water will enter it, the air having taken up all the\r\navailable space, and only allowing as much space as may be accounted for\r\nby its faculty of compression.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that if an enlarged tumbler could be lowered\r\nto the bed of the sea, a man might be enclosed within it, and for a time\r\nbe able to support life by means of the air contained within the “bell,”\r\nas this enlarged tumbler was popularly called.\r\n\r\nIt is equally evident that within a short time the air within the bell\r\nmust be exhausted, and that, unless a fresh supply could be introduced,\r\nthe diver within the bell would be as effectively drowned as if there\r\nwere no bell at all.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration is a kind of chart, so to speak, of the\r\nmode in which air was formerly supplied to the bell.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand is seen a section of the Diving-bell itself, together\r\nwith the seat on which the divers can rest. There is also an\r\nescape-valve at the top of the bell, by which the vitiated air can pass\r\naway; but, as it is not essential to the subject in hand, and is rather\r\ncomplicated in structure, it has been omitted.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the left of the bell is a cask, to which several heavy\r\nweights are attached. This cask contained compressed air, and, after it\r\nwas lowered by the side of the bell, the end of the flexible tube was\r\ntaken into the bell, the tap turned, and the compressed air rushed into\r\nthe bell, taking the place of that which had been exhausted by\r\nrespiration, and was allowed to pass through the escape-valve. I may\r\nmention that the divers unexpectedly discovered that, when they were\r\nbreathing compressed air, they could dispense with respiration for a\r\nwonderfully long time, the amount of oxygen taken in at a single breath\r\nbeing enough to renovate the blood more than could be done by several\r\nordinary inspirations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF WATER-SPIDERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIVING-BELL.]\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the illustration is seen a sketch of the nest of the\r\nnow familiar Water-spider (_Argyronetra aquatica_), taken from some\r\nspecimens in my possession.\r\n\r\nThe Water-spider is really a remarkable being. Itself a denizen of air,\r\nbreathing our earthly atmosphere just as we do, and as capable of being\r\ndrowned as ourselves, it nevertheless passes nearly the whole of its\r\nexistence under water, and in that strange locality lays its eggs and\r\nrears its young. How this wonderful feat is performed we shall now see.\r\n\r\nWhen the female Water-spider wishes to deposit her eggs, she looks out\r\nfor a suitable locality, and, being a good diver, tests the various\r\naquatic herbage until she has found a favourable spot, and then sets to\r\nwork on her remarkable nest, which I believe is quite original in\r\nzoology.\r\n\r\nAfter stretching a few stout threads by way of a scaffolding, she\r\nattaches to the plant a small silken cell, shaped very much like an\r\nacorn, but not so large. Ascending to the surface of the water, she\r\ncontrives to clasp a bubble of air between her last pair of legs, and,\r\nladen with this airy treasure, dives below.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she has reached the entrance to the cell, which is always\r\nbelow, she loosens her hold of the air-bubble. It at once rises into the\r\ncell, and expels a proportionate amount of water. Not many of these\r\njourneys are required before the nest is filled with air, and then the\r\ndiminutive architect spends the greater part of its time in holding on\r\nto the mouth of the little diving-bell, and supporting life by means of\r\nthe air within it.\r\n\r\nThis nest, as the reader will see, is an exact representation of the\r\nvarious diving schemes in which air-bells are the chief portions of the\r\nmachinery, although the air is conducted into them after a different\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to another mode of diving, in which the bell is practically\r\nsuperseded by the flexible tube, which allows to the diver far more\r\nrange than can be obtained by the bell. In this case the diver wears a\r\npeculiar dress, the chief part of which is a helmet so constructed that\r\nair can be introduced to it from above the surface of the water, and,\r\nafter respiration, can escape by means of a valve.\r\n\r\nAir is pumped into the tube by assistants above water, and, as the tube\r\nis long and elastic, the diver can move about with considerable freedom.\r\nAs is the case with the diving-bell, the diver’s tube is strengthened by\r\nan internal spiral wire, so that it is always open, however it may be\r\nbent or twisted.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand figure of the illustration represents the diver examining\r\npart of a sunken vessel. The tube through which he breathes is seen\r\npassing to the surface of the water, and so is the line by which he\r\ngives his signals to his comrades above. In his hand he holds a lamp\r\nwhich can burn for a limited time, being connected by a smaller but\r\nsimilarly constructed tube to a vessel of compressed air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the same illustration are shown the curious Rat-tail\r\nMaggots, as they are popularly called. They are the larvæ of the common\r\nDrone-fly (_Eristalis tenax_), which is so common towards the end of\r\nsummer, and looks so curiously like a bee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAT-TAILED MAGGOTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIVER WITH AIR-TUBE.]\r\n\r\nThese creatures pass their larval life buried in the mud and below the\r\nsurface of the water, and yet are obliged to breathe atmospheric air.\r\nThis they do by means of the long appendages which have gained for them\r\nthe name of Rat-tails. These “tails” are very elastic, and are capable\r\nof elongation and contraction to a wonderful extent.\r\n\r\nWhen the creature is undisturbed, it lies buried in the mud with its\r\nhead downwards, and its tail extended so that it reaches the surface of\r\nthe water. Within this tail are two air-tubes, which are connected with\r\nthe principal tracheæ, which have already been mentioned. They are\r\nwonderfully elastic, and, when the tail is extended to its utmost limit,\r\nare nearly straight. When, however, the tail is contracted, the tubes\r\nbecome self-coiled by their own elasticity, and shrink into the base of\r\nthe tail.\r\n\r\nAs the tail is very transparent, it is easy to see how these movements\r\nare conducted. The larvæ, which may be found in almost any stagnant\r\nwater, should be placed in a tall and narrow glass. Some mud should be\r\nplaced at the bottom of the glass, which should then be filled with\r\nwater to the depth of three inches or so.\r\n\r\nWhen the mud has quite subsided, and the water become clear, the long\r\nslender tails of the larvæ will be seen so elongated that their tips\r\nreach just above the surface of the water. A magnifying-glass will\r\neasily show the two tubes within the tail.\r\n\r\nLet the glass be but slightly tapped, and all the tail is withdrawn in a\r\nmoment, so as to be out of reach of external danger. The\r\nmagnifying-glass will then show the two tubes lying contracted in the\r\nbase of the tail, and taking astonishingly little space, considering the\r\namount of elongation which they can sustain. And, on examining the\r\nvarious bends and curves of the tubes, the value and power of the spiral\r\nspring will at once be seen. True, they are very small, but in Nature\r\nall things go by comparison, and our whole earth itself is as a grain of\r\nsand upon the seashore among the grandeurs of the visible universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAPING SPRING.\r\n\r\nThe last of the springs which can be mentioned in this work are those\r\nwhich are used for leaping purposes.\r\n\r\nThe figure on the right hand represents the common Spring-jack or\r\nSkip-jack with which children are always so much amused. It consists of\r\na flattened piece of wood called the “tongue,” which is inserted into a\r\ntwisted string, so that it forms a tolerably powerful spring. When\r\ntwisted round, and then suddenly released, it strikes against the ground\r\nwith such force that the whole machine is thrown into the air.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Skip-jack is made of a fowl’s merrythought, as shown in\r\nthe illustration; sometimes of the breast-bone of a goose; and sometimes\r\nof a piece of wood cut into the semblance of a frog, and painted. In all\r\ncases, however, the machinery is practically the same. I may mention _en\r\npassant_ that these frog Skip-jacks are most acceptable presents to\r\nsavage chiefs in many parts of the world, and that the most powerful and\r\nvenerable warriors are as delighted with these toys as any European\r\nchild of six years old.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we will turn to Nature, and see what she has in the way of\r\nSkip-jacks.\r\n\r\nAll entomologists will at once have before their minds the vast groups\r\nof Skip-jack Beetles, technically termed _Elateridæ_, and also known as\r\nClick-beetles, from the sharp clicking sound which they produce when in\r\nthe execution of their curious gymnastics. To this group belong the\r\nfire-flies of warm countries, and it may be mentioned that the larvæ of\r\nsome of our species are too familiar to the agriculturist under the name\r\n“wireworm.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKIP-JACK BEETLE. GRASSHOPPER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKIP-JACK.]\r\n\r\nAll these beetles have very short legs and very long bodies, so that if\r\nthey should fall on their backs on a smooth surface, they could not\r\nrecover themselves. Now, as they, when discovered, instinctively try to\r\nsave themselves by falling to the ground, it is evident that some means\r\nmust be used to enable them to regain their position. This is found in a\r\nmost curious apparatus.\r\n\r\nAttached to the “prothorax” is a rather long, pointed, and very elastic\r\nprojection exactly corresponding with the tongue of the Skip-jack. The\r\nend of this tongue fits into a groove in the “sternum.”\r\n\r\nWhen the beetle falls on its back, it curves its body as shown in the\r\nillustration, the tongue thus being freed from its groove. It then\r\nsmartly springs the tongue back into its place with the sharp clicking\r\nsound already referred to, and does so with such force that it leaps\r\ninto the air to some height.\r\n\r\nGenerally it falls on its feet, but if it should fail, it repeats the\r\nprocess. If one of these beetles be laid on a plate or similar smooth\r\nsurface, it will skip ten or twelve times without stopping, and after a\r\nshort rest will begin again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE are some curious little beings, popularly called Spring-tails,\r\nwhich afford excellent examples of the Leaping Spring. Their exact place\r\nin the system of Nature is rather uncertain, some zoologists considering\r\nthem as insects, while strict entomologists reject them. They are very\r\nsmall, and mostly of a darkish brown colour.\r\n\r\nPlenty of them may be found under stones in damp spots, under bark, and\r\nin similar localities, though they are often found in houses, and have\r\nfrequently traversed the paper on which I have been writing this book.\r\nCellars are favourite localities of theirs, and a little flour sprinkled\r\non a plate or piece of paper in a cellar is tolerably sure to attract\r\nthem. Although they are certainly not more than the fifteenth of an inch\r\nin length, they may be at once recognised by their peculiar attitude,\r\nwhich very much resembles that of a dog or cat in its usual sitting\r\nposture.\r\n\r\nAs long as they are not disturbed they crawl about in a quiet manner,\r\nbut if touched, or even alarmed, they suddenly make a tremendous leap,\r\npropelling themselves by means of a forked and elastic tail, doubled\r\nunder their bodies, and acting just like the tongue of a Skip-jack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the Skip-jack Beetle is shown the common Grasshopper, as an\r\nexample of muscular leaping springs.\r\n\r\nWe all know what wonderful leaps the Grasshopper, Cricket, and all their\r\nkin can make, the leaping movement being evidently intended more as a\r\nmeans of defence than as an ordinary mode of locomotion. The same may be\r\nobserved in the Kangaroos and Gerboas, which are content to use an\r\nordinary walking pace when undisturbed, but when alarmed can make\r\ntremendous leaps, and outstrip almost any pursuer.\r\n\r\nEven in Man, the Horse, the Dog, &c., which are most essentially leaping\r\nanimals, the same principle is employed, the legs being used as muscular\r\nsprings acted upon by the will of the owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFOOD AND COMFORT.\r\n\r\n     Parents and their Young.--Milk, and the various Ways of obtaining\r\n     and using it.--The Kafir Tribes and Clotted Milk.--The Tonga\r\n     Islanders.--The Tartars.--Ants and Aphides.--Honey-dew.--Milch Cows\r\n     in Insect-land.--Fish-tanks and Aquaria.--Bill of the\r\n     Pelican.--Eggs and Chickens.--The Hen-coop.--Nest of\r\n     Termite.--Workers and Queen.--Egg-hatching.--The Hen and her\r\n     Young.--Artificial Egg-hatching Machine.--The Snake and her\r\n     Eggs.--The Gad-fly and Bot-fly.--Preservation of\r\n     Provisions.--Hanging Meat.--Eggs of the Lace-wing\r\n     Fly.--Spider-eggs.--The Butcher’s Hook and the Claws of the\r\n     Sloth.--Bats and Insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject is necessarily a very large one, and I shall, in\r\nconsequence, be obliged to compress it, though it might well make a\r\nseparate work by itself. For Food represents the very existence of Man,\r\nconsidered as one of the animal world; and Comfort represents the\r\nprogress of civilisation, by which man leaves day by day his savage and\r\nsolitary nature behind him, and becomes social, moral, and elevated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPUTTING aside the instinct which forces the parent to feed the young\r\nwithout external assistance, we come to those cases where the parent has\r\nto seek food which the offspring could not have found for itself, and\r\noften to prepare it for the use of the offspring.\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of the world, the milk of various animals is the\r\nstaple of food, not only for children, but adults; and the “milk diet,”\r\nas it is called, is strongly urged by many physicians of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe Kafir tribes, for example, a wonderfully powerful race of men, live\r\nalmost wholly on sour milk, mixed with maize flour, never eating such\r\nvaluable animals as kine except on great occasions. Yet the natives of\r\nthe Tonga Islands think that nothing can be more disgusting than for a\r\nhuman being to drink the milk of a cow.\r\n\r\nHow the operation of milking is conducted we need not say, whether it be\r\nperformed on the cow as with most nations, or the ass in case of need\r\nwith ourselves, or the mare as with the Tartars, or the goat and sheep\r\nin various parts of the world. The milk of the sheep, by the way, is\r\nsingularly rich and nourishing.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say that the animals which are to be milked are kept for\r\nthat purpose, and that the touch of the human hand, rightly applied,\r\ninduces the animal to part with its milky stores.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature there is an exact parallel.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that some species of Ants are in the habit of\r\nacting in exactly the same manner as ourselves, in not only extracting a\r\nnutritious liquid from other insects, but watching and tending those\r\nwhich furnish their daily food just as a good dairyman watches and tends\r\nhis cows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANT AND APHIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILKING COW.]\r\n\r\nThe Ants, being insects, would naturally require insect cows, and such\r\nare to be found in the Aphides, of which mention has already been made.\r\nThese insects are furnished with a pair of very small tubercles near the\r\nend of the abdomen, and from them flows that sweet liquid which is so\r\nfamiliar to us under the name of “honey-dew.” For centuries no one knew\r\nthe source of the sweet honey-dew which attracted all the bees of the\r\nneighbourhood to the tree on whose leaves it was sprinkled, sometimes in\r\npatches, and sometimes coating them with a thin shining coat, as if\r\nvarnished.\r\n\r\nAt last it was discovered that the honey-dew is, in fact, the liquid\r\nexudations from these tubercles upon the backs of the aphides, and that\r\nthe ants feed regularly upon it. Not only do they lick up the honey-dew\r\nthat has fallen from the ants, but they milk them, so to speak, exactly\r\nas a dairymaid milks a cow. With their antennæ the ants pat and stroke\r\nthe tubercles of the aphides, and in a few seconds a drop of pellucid\r\nliquid appears at the extremity. This is the honey-dew, and is at once\r\nlapped up by the ant, which proceeds from one aphis to another until it\r\nhas obtained its fill of the sweet food.\r\n\r\nHow the ants carry off the aphides, cherish and guard them for the sake\r\nof their honey-dew, is a story too long to be told, but it is well known\r\namong entomologists. Our English ants are, however, totally eclipsed by\r\na Mexican species, which not only collects honey, but stores it in the\r\nbodies of its kindred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PELICAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH-TANK.]\r\n\r\nAfter taking precautions that no food can escape, the ants feed with\r\ntheir sweet store their companion, who is thus doomed to pass the\r\nremainder of life as a mere honey-cell. The abdomen becomes spherical,\r\nsmooth, and so transparent that the honey can be seen within it. It is\r\nquite air-tight, and so preserves the fragrance of the honey until it is\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nSo plentiful are these honey-ants, that they are an article of commerce,\r\nand are sold by measure for the purpose of making a sort of mead. There\r\nare many of them in the British Museum, with the honey still within\r\ntheir transparent bodies, and they are well worth seeing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE accompanying illustration represents the artificial and natural way\r\nof preserving food in an uninjured state. The right-hand figure is that\r\nof an ordinary glass aquarium, such as was in general use until the\r\nproperties of air and water were better understood, and it still need\r\nnot be rejected. It is simply a vessel in which water is contained, so\r\nthat aquatic or marine animals may be able to live in it for some time.\r\n\r\nThere are infinite varieties of the “Fish-tank,” if we may so call it,\r\nthe chief of which is the “well,” which is so extensively used in\r\nbringing fish to market.\r\n\r\nThrough the bottom of the boat projects a sort of box pierced with\r\nholes, so that the water has free access and egress. The sides of the\r\nbox are so high that there is no fear of the water rising into the boat.\r\nWhen fish are taken, they are thrown into the well, and there can live\r\nuntil they are wanted for sale.\r\n\r\nAlso, as all know who are acquainted with river-banks or seashores,\r\nfishermen have similar wells detached from the boats, and partly or\r\nentirely sunk in the water. In them they keep their stock, and, when a\r\ncustomer arrives, they simply draw the box ashore, so that the water\r\nruns out, select what fish they choose, and replace the box in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW, the power of conveying fish to some distance without destroying\r\nlife has for countless ages been possessed by the Pelican, one of which\r\nbirds is shown in the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\nAs every one knows, the chief peculiarity of this bird is the large and\r\nvery elastic membrane of the lower jaw. When not in use, it contracts by\r\nits own elasticity, and the bill looks quite slender, as well as long.\r\nBut, when distended with water and fish, it presents the appearance\r\nshown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nAny one who wishes to see the exercise of this power can do so by\r\nattending the Zoological Gardens, and visiting the Pelicans at\r\nfeeding-time, and an hour or two before it. They hardly seem to be the\r\nsame birds. Some years ago I made a series of sketches of the same\r\nPelican under different circumstances, and it is scarcely possible to\r\nbelieve that they could be, as they are, truthful representations of the\r\nsame bird.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE right-hand figure of the next illustration requires no comment, as\r\nit simply represents the ordinary hen-coop.\r\n\r\nAs everybody is aware, the object of the coop is to keep the hen within\r\nits bars, while the little chicks can run in and out as they choose, and\r\nthe coop is made so as to prevent the egress of the mother, while the\r\noffspring find no difficulty in escaping.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW, in the world of insects we find an exactly analogous structure. As\r\nis the case with many hymenopterous insects, there is in the nest of the\r\nTermite, or White Ant, as it is popularly called, a single perfect\r\nfemale, which is the mother of the nest. A similar arrangement occurs in\r\nthe common hive-bee, but there is a notable distinction between the\r\nqueen Bee and the queen Termite, the latter belonging to the\r\nneuropterous order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN TERMITE IN HER CELL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEN IN HER COOP.]\r\n\r\nThe former is unconfined, and moves about from cell to cell, depositing\r\nher eggs within them, and taking the greatest pains that they occupy\r\nexactly their proper place within the cell. The latter never moves after\r\nshe has begun to deposit eggs, but remains motionless in the same spot,\r\nand allows her subordinates to dispose of the eggs which she lays.\r\n\r\nHow this end is achieved will now be seen.\r\n\r\nThe reader is probably aware that the queen Termite attains to enormous\r\ndimensions, her head, thorax, and legs retaining their normal size, but\r\nthe abdomen becoming several inches in length, and thick in proportion.\r\nThe legs are necessarily unable to move so vast a body, and in order\r\nthat so important a personage should not receive injury, a large oval\r\ncell is built around her, from which she never moves for the rest of her\r\nlife. She has but one duty, namely, to lay eggs, and so is fed that she\r\nmay have strength to produce them. She is simply passive, and never even\r\nsees her eggs, much less has care of her young.\r\n\r\nAll the care of guarding and nurturing the eggs and young falls upon the\r\nworker Termites. These insects are quite small, about the size of our\r\ncommon Wood-ant.\r\n\r\nWhen they build the clay cell around their queen, they bore a number of\r\nholes along the sides, which are just large enough to allow the workers\r\nto pass freely, but which effectually exclude the soldier Termites, or\r\nany foes larger than themselves.\r\n\r\nThrough these apertures streams of workers are continually passing--some\r\nentering the cell to fetch the eggs, and others coming out with eggs\r\ncarried carefully in their jaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “WURBLES” OF ŒSTRUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGG-HATCHING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThus, as the reader will see, we have in Nature an exact analogy of Art,\r\nthe Termite queen being confined within her cell exactly as is the hen\r\nwithin the coop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEING on the subject of eggs and egg-hatching, we will take another case\r\nin which Art has acknowledgedly followed Nature.\r\n\r\nWe all know that eggs are developed into life by means of well-regulated\r\nheat, and that with birds the general rule is, that the needful heat is\r\nsupplied by the parent bird, who sits upon them for a certain time,\r\nuntil the young birds make their appearance in the world.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances, the aid of the parent bird is quite\r\nsufficient; but when the progress of civilisation requires that the eggs\r\nof poultry should be hatched in numbers too great for the powers of the\r\nparent bird, Man has been fain to imitate Nature, and to invent machines\r\nwhereby eggs can be hatched by artificial heat, regulated to the\r\ntemperature of the hen’s body.\r\n\r\nVarious as are these machines in detail, they are all alike in\r\nprinciple, and the right-hand figure of the accompanying illustration\r\nwill give a fair idea of the method which is employed.\r\n\r\nA box is fitted up with trays, on which the eggs are arranged. At the\r\nbottom of the box there is the heat-producing apparatus, which can be\r\nregulated at pleasure. The trays of eggs can be moved from one part of\r\nthe box to another, so as to insure the right amount of heat, and, if\r\nthis process be only carefully carried out, the young chicks emerge from\r\nthe eggs exactly as they would have done if the hen had sat upon them.\r\n\r\nThis machine is sometimes called the Artificial Mother, and it is worthy\r\nof notice that it is no modern invention, the ancient Egyptians having\r\nused it more than three thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWITH regard to Nature, it would have been simple enough to give one\r\nillustration of a bird sitting on her eggs, but I have preferred to\r\nselect a different subject, as more relevant to the question of\r\nartificial heat.\r\n\r\nThere is an insect to which we have had several occasions of reference,\r\nnamely, the Wurble-fly of the ox, scientifically known as _Œstrus\r\nbovis_.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this insect are deposited in the skin of the ox, and are\r\nthere hatched by the heat of the animal. In proportion as the larva\r\ngrows, it raises lumps upon the skin, these being practically the roofs\r\nof the artificial home. There are several other species of the same\r\ngenus, all of which have their eggs hatched by the heat of the animals\r\non which they are placed. There are, for example, the common Bot-fly\r\n(_Œstrus equi_), whose eggs are hatched in the interior of the horse,\r\nand the Sheep-fly (_Œstrus ovis_), whose eggs are hatched in the head\r\nof the sheep. The common Snake leaves her eggs to be hatched in the\r\nartificial heat produced by decaying vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE now come to the preservation of provisions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we have the well-known “cache” of Northern\r\nAmerica--_i.e._ a spot wherein provisions are hidden, and their locality\r\nonly marked by signs intelligible to those for whose use they are\r\nintended. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to mention that many\r\ncreatures--such as the dog, the squirrel, and most of the crow\r\ntribe--are in the habit of concealing provisions for future use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIDER-NESTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGGS OF LACE-WING FLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIDER-NEST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROVISIONS HUNG TO TREE BRANCH.]\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the world, however, where the rights of hunters are\r\nacknowledged, any one who kills a deer, or other animal of chase, and is\r\nnot able to carry off the entire body, can preserve it for his own use.\r\nHe simply cuts it up in hunter fashion, and hangs the various portions\r\nto branches of trees, where they are out of the reach of wild beasts.\r\nStores like these, such as are shown in the illustration, are always\r\nrespected, and no hunter would dream of helping himself to the game\r\nwhich was killed and dressed by another.\r\n\r\nBeasts of prey, however, cannot be expected to be so punctilious, and in\r\nconsequence the hunters hang their meat to branches which cannot be\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature we find many similar examples, one or two of which are given\r\non the left hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\nIn the centre is seen a group of eggs of the Lace-wing Fly\r\n(_Hemerobius_), so called on account of the delicate, lace-like\r\nstructure of its beautiful pale green wings.\r\n\r\nWhen the female lays her eggs she always chooses a slight twig, and\r\nupon it deposits a little drop of a slimy consistence. She then draws\r\nout this drop into a thread, which hardens as it is brought into contact\r\nwith the air. At the extreme end of the thread she places an egg, which\r\nis thus kept at some height above the ground, and defies the approach of\r\ninimical insects. The eggs, as well as the stalks, are perfectly white,\r\nand have so singular a resemblance to mosses, that for many years they\r\nwere actually classed and figured as such.\r\n\r\nThese egg-groups are plentiful enough, if the observer only knows where\r\nto look for them. I have several of them in my collection, and have\r\nfound that nearly every one who sees them for the first time takes them\r\nfor mosses. I never myself saw the pretty insect lay its eggs, and for\r\nthe description am indebted to Mr. A. G. Butler, of the British Museum,\r\nwho has kept them and watched their habits.\r\n\r\nThe objects on either side of the Lace-wing Fly’s eggs are egg-groups of\r\ncertain spiders, suspended by threads from branches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA STILL more remarkable instance of unconscious imitation may be found\r\nin the two objects in the accompanying illustration. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that the right-hand figure represents a portion of the\r\narrangement by which a butcher hangs up his meat out of harm’s way until\r\nit is wanted.\r\n\r\nThe hooks in question are simply formed into a double curve, like the\r\nletter S, and can be slid along the horizontal bar without any danger of\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\nNow, in the common Sloth we have an exact prototype of the butcher’s\r\nhook. The Sloth passes the whole of its life in the remarkable attitude\r\nwhich is shown in the illustration. It lives among the branches--not on\r\nthem, but under them--its claws being long and curved, just like a\r\nbutcher’s hook. I have often watched the animal traversing the branches,\r\nand have been greatly struck with the accurately picturesque description\r\nof the late Mr. Waterton, who was the first to discover the real\r\ncharacter of the Sloth.\r\n\r\nIt was he who found out that the previous ideas as to the Sloth’s mode\r\nof life were utterly erroneous, and that, instead of being a sort of\r\nbungle, the Sloth was as perfect in its way, and as well fitted for its\r\nmode of life, as the lion or tiger. He discovered that the animal\r\nalways hung from the branches, as shown in the illustration. In fact, as\r\nSydney Smith remarked in his witty review of “Waterton’s Wanderings,”\r\nthe Sloth passes his whole life in suspense, “like a young clergyman\r\ndistantly related to a bishop.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLOTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTCHERS’ HOOKS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE are many other creatures which afford similar examples, though\r\nperhaps none are so striking as the Sloth.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there are the whole tribe of Bats, which, by means of the\r\ncurved claws attached to their hind-feet, can hang themselves head\r\ndownwards in the open air, and even swing in wind, without the least\r\nfear of falling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC COMFORT.\r\n\r\n     How to make Home comfortable.--The Bed in its various Forms.--The\r\n     Feather Bed of Man.--The Eider-duck and her Plumage.--The Rabbit\r\n     and her Down.--The Long-tailed Titmouse and her wonderful\r\n     Nest.--The Hammock of civilised Man and Savage.--The Sailor’s\r\n     Canvas Hammock.--The String Hammock of tropical America.--Nest of\r\n     the Pensile Oriole.--Silken Hammock of the Tiger-moth and other\r\n     Insects.--The Mat Bed.--Cocoa-nut Matting.--The Robber-crab and its\r\n     Bed.--Strength and Uses of the Cocoa-nut Fibre.--The Surgeon’s\r\n     “Cradle” and the Pupa of Tabanus.--The Art of Sewing and the\r\n     Tailor-bird.--Principle of the Umbrella and its Original\r\n     Use.--Natural Umbrella on the Rosemary.--Servants and Slaves, and\r\n     the Distinction between them.--The Use of Slaves in hot\r\n     Countries.--Slavery in the Insect World.--The Ants and their\r\n     Slaves.--Ornamental Gardening and Pleasure-grounds.--The Hanging\r\n     Gardens of Babylon.--The Bower-birds and their Pleasure-grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to a different branch of the same subject, namely, the means\r\nby which our dwellings are rendered comfortable.\r\n\r\nAfter having procured a dwelling which can withstand the elements, we\r\nnext look for a bed on which to repose, and which will ease the limbs\r\nand brain, wearied by the toils of the day.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the ordinary feather bed and its\r\nmultitudinous natural springs. We now have to see how the various kinds\r\nof beds are anticipated in Nature, and will begin with the feather bed.\r\n\r\nAs to our own beds, nothing need be said about objects so familiar,\r\nalthough, in order to preserve the parallelism, it is necessary to\r\nintroduce an illustration on the right hand of the page.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand are shown two examples of natural feather beds,\r\nselected from many others on account of the exact parallels which they\r\nafford.\r\n\r\nWe all know the wonderful warmth and lightness of the Eider-down\r\nmattress or quilt, though there are comparatively few who know how the\r\nEider-down is procured.\r\n\r\nIn common with many other creatures, the Eider-duck forms a bed for her\r\nyoung by plucking the down from her own body. Rabbits do exactly the\r\nsame thing, as all boys know who have kept them, the only difference\r\nbeing that fur is substituted for feathers. So do many insects,\r\nstripping themselves of their own downy covering, and employing it for\r\nthe comfort of their offspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-TAILED TITMOUSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EIDER-DUCK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEATHER BED.]\r\n\r\nThe lower figure on the left hand represents the Eider-duck in the act\r\nof plucking the far-famed down from her breast in order to make a soft\r\nand warm couch for her young, and the amount of feathers which she will\r\ndevote to this purpose is simply astonishing. Their weight is\r\ninsignificant, but their bulk is wonderful.\r\n\r\nAbove the Eider-duck is shown the nest of the common Long-tailed\r\nTitmouse. It is the most perfect nest that is constructed by any British\r\nbird. Its shape exactly resembles that of an egg, and it has but one\r\nsmall aperture, as is shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe Titmouse lays a vast number of eggs, and almost fills the nest with\r\nsoft downy feathers, on which they can rest. If the finger be introduced\r\ninto the nest through the aperture, the tiny eggs can be felt reposing\r\nin their natural feather-bed. In this case, however, the bird does not\r\ndenude herself of feathers, but has a way of picking them up wherever\r\nshe can find them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we will take another form of bed, namely, the Hammock, which is used\r\nin many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the well-known hammock as used on board our ships, we will\r\ntake the same kind of bed as used among the natives of tropical America.\r\n\r\nIn that wonderful part of the world, where water and vegetation reign\r\nsupreme, an aërial couch of some kind is absolutely needful, and is\r\nsupplied by the singularly ingenious hammocks which are constructed by\r\nthe natives. They are made of a fine, but marvellously strong fibre,\r\nprocured from the aloe plant by the simple process of soaking the long\r\nleaves in water, and dashing them against a stone. The soft green parts\r\nare eaten away, and the tough fibres remain in all their strength.\r\n\r\nFrom these fibres are woven the strings of which the Hammocks are made.\r\nI possess four of the Hammocks, all made on different lines, but all\r\nbased on the same principle. In some the strings are laid parallel to\r\neach other, and connected by transverse strings at regular intervals,\r\nbut in the best specimens they are interlaced diagonally into a sort of\r\nloose network without knots, so that it yields in every direction to the\r\noutlines of the body.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most comfortable couches ever invented, especially when\r\nit is of considerable size. I have one specimen which, even in its\r\ncurved state, extends completely across a tolerably sized room. I never\r\nuse it because it is so comfortable that the temptation to lie in it is\r\nalmost too strong to be resisted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAS to Hammocks in Nature, they are almost too many to be computed.\r\n\r\nSo we will first take the nest of the Pensile Oriole, which is shown in\r\nthe illustration, and which is an admirable example of the Hammock,\r\nbeing woven from long vegetable fibres intertwisted very much like the\r\nstrings of the South American Hammock. And as if to increase the\r\nresemblance, the bird, whenever it can do so, will carry off hanks of\r\ncotton, linen, thread, or pieces of string, and weave them into its\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nI have one of these nests, and, directly I saw it, was struck with its\r\nexact similitude to the Hammock of human manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF PENSILE ORIOLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMMOCK.]\r\n\r\nThere are many other birds in various parts of the world especially in\r\nAustralia, which make their nests on exactly the same principle, though\r\nin slightly varied forms.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the insect world, there are innumerable examples of the natural\r\nHammock, the most common of which is that made by the caterpillars of\r\nthe Tiger-moth, and in which it slings itself while undergoing its\r\nchanges from the chrysalis to the perfect state.\r\n\r\nIt is made of silken threads, interwoven so slightly that the chrysalis\r\ncan be seen through them, and so exactly like the Hammock of the South\r\nAmerican Indian that if a drawing were made and enlarged, one might\r\neasily be taken for the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we come to the Mat Bed, which is so much used in the warmer parts of\r\nthe world, where the earth is dry, and the air so warm that nothing is\r\nrequired but the slightest possible protection from the soil.\r\n\r\nIn inland places, such as Southern Africa, the bed is made of long\r\ngrass-stems laid side by side, and sewn together with a sort of twine.\r\nOne of these beds in my collection is some three feet wide by seven feet\r\nlong, and can be rolled up into a cylinder so compact and light that\r\neven a child could carry it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBBER-CRAB.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOA-NUT MAT.]\r\n\r\nOf course, when the Kafirs are on a journey, the women have to carry the\r\nbeds, together with the heavy wooden pillows and other necessaries, the\r\nmen carrying nothing but their weapons. I have a pair of figures made by\r\na native artist, representing a Kafir man and woman on a journey, the\r\nwoman staggering under her heavy burdens, the bed being included, and\r\nthe man stepping lightly along, with nothing but his spears and\r\nknobkerries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the sea-coasts, however, where the cocoa-nut palm grows, the fibre of\r\nthe husk is the principal material for bedding. These fibres lie so\r\nparallel to each other on the surface of the cocoa-nut, that they are\r\neasily stripped off, fastened together, and formed into mats of any\r\nshape or thickness. One of these mats is shown on the right hand of the\r\nillustration, and the reader will see how simple is its manufacture.\r\n\r\nOwing to the ease with which it is made into a fabric, the cocoa-nut\r\nfibre was in great use as armour before the bullet set all armour at\r\ndefiance. It will be remembered that when Captain Cook was murdered, he\r\ncommitted the mistake of firing a charge of small shot instead of a\r\nbullet, and the fact that the cocoa-nut mat carried by the man at whom\r\nhe fired resisted the shot, encouraged the natives to attack and murder\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVEN the cocoa-nut mat has its precursor in Nature.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain Crab inhabiting the cocoa-nut bearing parts of the\r\nworld, which not only makes itself a bed from the fibre, but supplies it\r\nto mankind.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful Crab has the power of ascending the cocoa-nut palms,\r\nwhich is beyond the power of any man except a trained gymnast. It picks\r\nout the ripest fruits, and with its powerful claws tears off the fibre\r\nbefore breaking the shell and devouring the kernel, as is shown in the\r\nleft-hand figure of the illustration.\r\n\r\nAfter eating the kernel, which is at that time a soft, creamy substance,\r\nquite unlike the hard, indigestible material which we in England know by\r\nthe name of cocoa-nut, the Crab carries off the external fibres into its\r\nden, and there makes its bed of them. So great, indeed, is the amount of\r\ncocoa-nut fibre thus collected that the natives are accustomed to save\r\nthemselves the trouble of climbing the trees, and merely search for the\r\nholes in which these Crabs have made their nests, knowing the amount of\r\nready-gathered cocoa-nut fibre that is always to be found in them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER modification of the bed needs a short notice, especially as I\r\nhave practical and sad experience on the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUPA OF TABANUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURGICAL CRADLE.]\r\n\r\nIt is technically named the “cradle,” and is used to keep the bedclothes\r\nfrom pressing on a damaged limb.\r\n\r\nWhen a mere lad I contrived, at cricket, to dislocate the right ankle,\r\nand break the bone. An ignorant surgeon refused my request for a cradle,\r\nand absolutely tied the cover of a book to the sole of the foot. Of\r\ncourse this appliance was worse than useless. It acted as a lever,\r\nallowing the clothes to turn the foot round, and to the present day the\r\nright foot has never recovered its faculties. Had the simple “cradle”\r\nbeen used--_i.e._ a few sticks bent into an arch-like shape, and tied\r\ntogether, so as to keep the clothes from even touching the foot--all\r\nwould have been right.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration is shown the surgical cradle, as a\r\ndefence to a damaged leg. On the left is shown the curious natural\r\ncradle of the Gad-fly while undergoing its change into the perfect\r\nstate. It is quite hard and rounded, being formed from the skin of the\r\nlarva, and allows the pupa to lie within it, protected from any ordinary\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER point now comes before us.\r\n\r\nWe cannot well have our bedclothes--indeed, any kind of clothes--without\r\nthe use of needles and thread. The simplest form of sewing is that which\r\nis adopted in many parts of the world, namely, of boring holes and\r\npushing a thread through them, no eye being required in the needle. In\r\nthis way the Kafirs of Southern Africa and the Esquimaux of the Polar\r\nregions make their beautiful garments of skins. I have for many years\r\nhad in constant use two South African cloaks, or karosses, and one made\r\nby the natives of Vancouver’s Island, and they are now as good as they\r\nwere when they were first given to me. Naturally, such a mode of sewing\r\nconsumes much time, but, as time is not of the least value to these\r\nnative furriers, no harm is done, and the junctions of the different\r\nskins is absolutely perfect. Even where holes have been made in the\r\nskin, the native furrier has supplied their places with circular pieces\r\nso neatly inserted, that on the outside not a trace of the junction is\r\nvisible, and even the very set of the hairs is preserved.\r\n\r\nOur very modern needles, with their eyes which carry the thread, are but\r\na modification of the original plan of boring holes, and pushing the\r\nthread through them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATURE has a singular parallel in the case of the Tailor-bird, which\r\nsews leaves together by their edges, and makes its nest inside them. It\r\nacts exactly like one of our own shoemakers, using its slender and\r\nsharply pointed beak in lieu of the awl, and employing a slight but\r\nstrong vegetable fibre in place of the “waxed end” of the shoemaker, or\r\nthe sinew-thread of the Kafir.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration an ordinary needle and thread are seen on the\r\nright-hand side, and on the left are two nests of the Tailor-bird, taken\r\nfrom specimens in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAILOR-BIRDS AND NESTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEWING CLOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of sewing is strangely like that which is employed by the\r\nuncivilised furriers who have been described, and much superior to that\r\nwhich is seen in many other parts of the world. For example, I have a\r\nWest African quiver made of hide sewn together with stitches infinitely\r\nmore clumsy than those of the Tailor-bird.\r\n\r\nThe reader will also remark that I might have placed this singular nest\r\nin the category of beds, on account of the soft and warm lining on which\r\nthe young repose. I have, however, thought that it more properly belongs\r\nto the present division of the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOMETIMES we require a temporary as well as a permanent shelter from the\r\nelements, and procure it by means of the Umbrella.\r\n\r\nIn many countries, especially those where the climate is hot, the\r\nUmbrella is almost exclusively used, as, indeed, its name denotes, to\r\npreserve its owner from the direct sunbeams, and is, in fact, the\r\n“parasol” of our European ladies. It also is a mark of dignity, the\r\namount and quality of its decorations indicating rank, even though the\r\nman who sits under its shade is clothed in a modest cotton cloth wrapped\r\nround his waist.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of shielding the bearer from the sun the Umbrella was\r\nfirst introduced, and the introducer incurred the obloquy usual in such\r\ncases. Now, however, the Umbrella has by common consent become a\r\ndefence against rain and snow, the male sex leaving the parasol to the\r\ngentler half of creation, and submitting themselves to the chance of a\r\nsunstroke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE all know the ingenious Umbrellas of Africa, China, Japan, Siam, &c.;\r\nbut there are few persons who know that a common magnifying-glass will\r\ndisclose thousands of beautifully perfect umbrellas on the leaf of the\r\nRosemary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAIRS OF ROSEMARY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UMBRELLA.]\r\n\r\nPinch the Rosemary-leaf between the fingers, and a strong and peculiar\r\nperfume is evolved, just as when the peel of the orange is squeezed. The\r\nreason is the same in both cases, namely, the presence of multitudes of\r\nspherical vessels which contain their essential oil, secreted by the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nIn the orange they are sunk below the surface of the skin, and are\r\nprotected by it; but in the Rosemary they stand on slight footstalks, as\r\nshown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nBeing very delicate, and liable to be broken at the least touch, they\r\nare protected by a series of curiously formed hairs, which extend over\r\nthem exactly as would an umbrella, and defend them from the elements.\r\n\r\nThe surface of a Rosemary-leaf affords a singularly beautiful sight,\r\neven with a common magnifying-glass, the tiny perfume-globes gleaming\r\nlike little pearls in the broken lights that shine through the\r\numbrella-like hairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we come to another part of domestic life, namely, Servants.\r\n\r\nThere is a diversity of ideas on this subject, as we know by the\r\nvarious discussions respecting “lady-helps” and “gentlemen-helps,” which\r\nbid fair to initiate a revolution in domestic life. Servants are\r\nsometimes called the greatest plagues in life, but it is difficult to\r\nsee what could be done without them.\r\n\r\nThen there is the complaint that servants are not what they used to\r\nbe--the faithful retainers of the household, and considering themselves\r\nmembers of it. Perhaps not, but I have had experience of several\r\nfaithful retainers, and invariably found them to be unmitigated tyrants,\r\nassuming power, repudiating responsibility, and being practically the\r\nmaster or mistress of the household.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the great question of slavery in its various bearings.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the now acknowledged diversity of races, and the\r\nwell-known fact that the negro in a state of slavery to a European is\r\ninfinitely better off than he would have been in his own country, where\r\nthere is no law but that of might, we must entertain the question of\r\nenforced servitude, i.e. where the servants have no choice either in\r\nentering or leaving their situations.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, opposed, and rightly, to our modern English ideas that\r\na slave, under such a name, should exist on British ground. Yet there\r\nare thousands of Englishmen who are more wholly enslaved than was any\r\nnegro in the worst times of slavery. The chains may not be of visible\r\niron, nor the whips of tangible thongs, but they are, perhaps, all the\r\nmore galling and biting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOME of my readers may be aware that slavery exists in the insect world,\r\nand probably existed long before man came on earth.\r\n\r\nThere are many species of Ants which are absolutely incapable of\r\nmanaging their own nests or rearing their own young, and which, in\r\nconsequence, impress into their service the workers of other species of\r\nAnt, and hand over to them the entire labour of the establishment. They\r\ncan fight, and they can establish fresh colonies, but they cannot build\r\nnests, nor nurse their young, and so they impress into their service\r\nthose Ants whose instinct teaches them to do both.\r\n\r\nPeriodically the master Ants, if we may so call them, set off on a\r\nslave-hunting expedition. They find out the nest of the special Ant\r\nwhose aid they need, penetrate into it, and bear off the pupæ, or “ants’\r\neggs,” as they are popularly called. These are carried to their new\r\nhome, and are speedily hatched. They know no other home, and, led by\r\ninstinct, set to work as industriously as if they had never been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLAVE-CAPTURING ANTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFRICAN SLAVE-GANG.]\r\n\r\nThose who have watched their habits are unanimous in declaring that they\r\nseem perfectly happy and contented. No compulsion is used towards them,\r\nand they work because told to do so by their own instinct. Work they\r\nmust, and it does not in the least matter to them for whom the work is\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER branch of this subject is shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration, namely, the pleasure garden or playground.\r\n\r\nThis is, as we all know, a token of high civilisation, and even in the\r\nancient times the hanging gardens of Babylon were reckoned as the\r\ngreatest wonders of that great city, the then mistress of the world.\r\n\r\nNo savage ever dreamed of such a thing as a pleasure garden, nor could\r\nappreciate it if he saw it. Yet there are birds which far surpass the\r\nsavage in this respect, and which build recreation grounds for the sole\r\npurpose of amusement.\r\n\r\nThese are the well-known Bower-birds of Australia, which I sincerely\r\nhope may not be extirpated by the white man, as has been the case with\r\nso many creatures, including the aborigines of Tasmania themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Bower-birds, which are distantly related to our thrush and\r\nblackbird, but are about as large as jackdaws, have a curious habit of\r\nbuilding arched bowers quite independent of their nests.\r\n\r\nThe shape of one of these bowers is shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThe bird first weaves a sort of platform of flexible sticks, and then\r\nfastens into them a number of other sticks, so set that they form a sort\r\nof arched gallery. Through this gallery the birds love to run, and they\r\ninvariably decorate the ends with anything pretty that they can pick up,\r\nsuch as feathers, coloured stones, shells, ornaments, and the like. So\r\nwell is this proclivity known, that whenever any one who is living in\r\nthe Bush loses any small piece of property, such as a pencil-case or\r\nwatch-key, or even a tobacco-pipe, he always goes to the Bower-bird’s\r\npleasure garden, and mostly discovers the lost property.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAYGROUND OF BOWER-BIRD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARDEN BOWER.]\r\n\r\nAt the Zoological Gardens these Bower-birds have long lived, and it is a\r\nmost interesting sight to watch them weaving their platforms, raising\r\nthe bowers over them, and then keep running in at one end and out at the\r\nother, like children at play, and with their burnished plumage gleaming\r\nin the sunbeams.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand figure simply depicts a modern pleasure garden, and needs\r\nno description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL WARMTH.--RING AND STAPLE.--THE FAN.\r\n\r\n     Various Modes of warming Houses.--The Fire of the American Indian\r\n     and the Kafir.--The Oil-lamp of the Esquimaux.--The open Fireplace\r\n     and Chimney Stoves.--The laminated Stove and its Powers.--Gills of\r\n     the Lobster, Crab, and various Fishes.--Mode in which the Gills\r\n     act.--Why Fishes lie with their Heads against the Stream.--Drowning\r\n     a Fish.--The Ring and Staple, and their various Uses.--Head-bones\r\n     of the Fishing-frog or Angler-fish.--The Fan and its\r\n     Modifications.--Japanese and Chinese Fans.--The Feather Fan.--The\r\n     Palm-leaf.--Indian Fans.--The Hive Bee and its Wings.--Fans of the\r\n     Essequibo and South Sea Islanders.--The Fan Fire-guard.--Antennæ of\r\n     the Cockchafer.--Burial.--Various Modes of disposing of the\r\n     Dead.--Ordinary Habits of dying Animals.--Dead Insects.--The\r\n     Funeral-ant and its wonderful Habits.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL WARMTH.\r\n\r\nPassing from the direct to the indirect comforts of a household, we will\r\ntake Artificial Warmth.\r\n\r\nThe savage, as a matter of necessity, makes a fire in the middle of his\r\nhut, and lets the smoke have its own way. Sometimes, as is the case with\r\nthe North American Indians, the top of the conical hut is open, and the\r\nwhole edifice is a single chimney of large dimensions, something like\r\nthe “chimney-corner” of past days, which only survives in such places as\r\nthe New Forest.\r\n\r\nThen there are the various Kafir tribes of Southern Africa. They have no\r\naperture in their huts except the tiny doorway, which can only be\r\nentered on hands and knees. But they must have their fire. No argument\r\ncan persuade them that they had better make their fire and cook their\r\nfood outside the hut. So the wood-smoke fills the hut, coats it with a\r\nlining of soot, and gets out as it can through the sticks and withes of\r\nwhich the simple edifice is built.\r\n\r\nAs a contrast, we have the oil-lamp of Esquimaux-land, where there is no\r\nprovision for ventilation, where the snow-houses are tightly closed and\r\ncrammed with inhabitants, and where no one seems to need fresh air.\r\n\r\nThe next step in civilisation is to construct a tube for the purpose of\r\ncarrying off the smoke, such as we know by the name of chimney or flue,\r\nand to place the fire within it. We English people have an ingrained\r\nlove for the open fireplace, and though it really is an expensive\r\narrangement, it is worth the cost. Granting that it carries much of the\r\nheat into the chimney instead of throwing it into the room, it has at\r\nleast the advantage of acting as a ventilator, of ejecting air which has\r\nbeen rendered poisonous by respiration, and drawing a fresh supply from\r\nthe outer atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world, especially in Germany and the United States,\r\nthe place of the open fire is taken by closed stoves, without any\r\nventilation whatever, much to the discomfiture of ordinary Englishmen.\r\nStill, there are buildings, such as public halls and places of worship,\r\nin which open fireplaces are wholly impracticable, and where it is,\r\ntherefore, necessary to make use of the stove.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that in such cases the chief object is to procure\r\nthe greatest amount of heat with the least expenditure of fuel, and that\r\nobject seems to be best attained by the Laminated Stove shown on the\r\nright hand of the illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GILLS OF SHARK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GILLS OF TROUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STOVE.]\r\n\r\nIn this stove, the outer surface, instead of being plain, is divided\r\ninto a number of perpendicular plates, which are heated by the\r\ncontained fire, and expose a very large surface of hot metal to the air.\r\nThus the heat, instead of being wasted by being drawn through the flue\r\nor chimney, is thrown into the room, and keeps up a perpetual supply of\r\nwarm air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHAT the invention of this stove is an ingenious one nobody can deny.\r\nBut Nature has been long in advance of Art in the way of exposing as\r\nlarge a surface as possible with the least expenditure of space.\r\n\r\nVery familiar examples of this structure may be found in the many\r\ncreatures which inhabit the waters and breathe by means of gills, which\r\nextract the oxygen of the water.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, a Lobster or a Crab, open it, and look at the white,\r\npointed, uneatable objects which are popularly called “ladies’ fingers.”\r\nThese are the gills, or breathing apparatus, and their structure is\r\nreally wonderful. They are composed of innumerable laminæ, or very thin\r\nplates, covered with an exceedingly fine membrane, and placed closely\r\nside by side, but with sufficient distance between them to allow the\r\nwater to percolate the whole structure.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of an ordinary pocket lens the observer may make out a most\r\nwonderful system of blood-vessels, which permeate every one of the\r\nmyriad laminæ, and which extract the life-giving oxygen from the water\r\nas it passes between them.\r\n\r\nThen, to pass to animals of a higher order, take the gills of fishes.\r\nAny fish will do, provided that it be fresh, and, if it can be examined\r\nimmediately after death, so much the better. Taking things reciprocally,\r\nthe gills of the fish and the laminæ of the stove, are identical in\r\nprinciple, namely, the exposure of much surface with little loss of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nIf possible, the observer should inject the blood-vessels of the gills\r\nwith the conventional crimson and blue wax, showing the currents of the\r\narterial and venous blood. Each lamina forms a most wondrous object, and\r\nmay be gazed upon for weeks with increasing admiration.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has watched the habits of fishes must have noticed that in\r\nrunning waters they always have their heads against the stream, and do\r\nnot greatly care about shifting their positions.\r\n\r\nIn still waters, especially such as those of the ordinary glass\r\naquaria, the fish are perpetually on the move, whereas in such a river\r\nas the Dove of Derbyshire, and even the Darenth of Kent, large trout may\r\nbe seen almost motionless, but invariably with their heads directed up\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nThe reason is evident enough. As long as the fish lies with its head up\r\nthe stream the water flows through its gills, and enables it to breathe.\r\nWere the passage of the water stopped, the fish would be drowned.\r\nConsequently, all good anglers, when they hook a fish which is worth\r\ntaking, keep its head down the stream, prevent the water from washing\r\nover its gills, and consequently render it so weak by deprivation of\r\noxygen, that it becomes an easy prey, and is rendered subservient to a\r\nline of a single hair. Let the fish breathe, and a single struggle would\r\nsmash a line of treble the strength. But keep it from breathing by\r\ndirecting its head down the stream, and it rapidly loses all strength,\r\nand can be directed into the landing-net, or brought within the scope of\r\nthe gaff, without a chance of escape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI NEED hardly remark that on the right-hand side of the illustration is\r\nshown a Laminated Stove, and that on the left are drawings of the gills\r\nof the Shark tribe and the common Trout. If the reader would really like\r\nto look into the subject for himself, I should suggest the purchase of a\r\ncod’s head and shoulders and a lobster. The breathing apparatus can be\r\nremoved from each for examination, and the remainder will serve as a\r\nfirst course for dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\nRING AND STAPLE.\r\n\r\nHumble, and apparently insignificant, as the principle of the Ring and\r\nStaple may be, we owe no small amount of our domestic comfort to it. It\r\nmeets us in all kinds of ways, in the hinges of our boxes, in the\r\npadlocks of our doors, in the innside fastenings for our horses, in the\r\nseaside fastenings for ships’ cables, and in a thousand other ways too\r\nmany to enumerate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the right-hand side of the next illustration is shown the Ring and\r\nStaple as used for the purpose of mooring ships and boats, it being\r\nabsolutely necessary that the machinery, simple as it is, must be\r\ncapable of working in any direction, and with some latitude as to the\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD-BONES OF ANGLER-FISH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAPLE AND RING.]\r\n\r\nOn the left hand are shown two of the wonderful bones which are found in\r\nthe head of the Fishing-frog or Angler-fish (_Lophius_), and which serve\r\nas decoys, by means of which the smaller fish are entrapped into the\r\nvast jaws of the Angler-fish.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly necessary that these singular appendages should be capable\r\nof movement in every direction, and this object is attained by the\r\nstructure which is here shown, and which is almost equal to the\r\nball-and-socket joint for its freedom of movement. It will even allow of\r\npartial rotation, so as to cause the little strip of skin at its end to\r\nassume the aspect of a living worm, and entice the smaller fish into the\r\njaws of the dread trap that lies open before them.\r\n\r\nA figure of this fish may be seen on page 92.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAN.\r\n\r\nExcept in permanently cold countries, a Fan of some kind seems to be an\r\nabsolute necessity. Sometimes, as in the greater part of Europe, it is\r\nused only by the softer sex. The harder sex would often be only too glad\r\nto use it if they dared, and the same observation is equally true with\r\nregard to the parasol.\r\n\r\nBut, in such lands as Japan and China, the Fan is an absolute necessity\r\nof existence. Men, women, and children alike carry their Fan, and almost\r\nperpetually use it. I remember, when the troupe of Japanese acrobats\r\nwere in England, that one of them exhibited the national use of the Fan\r\nin an excessively ludicrous manner.\r\n\r\nOne of his comrades ascended to the roof of a lofty building, hung by\r\nhis legs to one of the rafters, and held in his hands a bamboo pole\r\nwhich was twenty feet long. Another Japanese also ascended, climbed over\r\nhis comrade, and settled on the bamboo pole, to which he clung only by\r\nthe clasp of his bare feet. Suddenly he slipped down the pole, stopped\r\nhimself when within a few inches of the end, squatted there with perfect\r\nunconcern, though at least forty feet from the ground, took his fan from\r\nthe back of his neck, and fanned himself while gravely surveying the\r\nstartled audience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALM-LEAF.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE HAND-SCREEN.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may remember Chang, the Chinese giant, who,\r\nby the way, in private life was a polished gentleman. He was never\r\nwithout his fan, always keeping it fluttering gently with an ease only\r\nto be acquired by a lifelong practice, and I really think that if he had\r\nbeen deprived of it he would have been seriously ill. How he slept\r\nwithout it is a wonder, for in his own house the fan was incessantly in\r\nmotion, and was worked with apparent unconsciousness on his part.\r\n\r\nI have often wished that in our country the ladies would manage their\r\nfans in the same quiet way when they are in a church or a concert-room,\r\nfor the perpetual rattle of the joints is enough to distract any\r\npreacher or conductor, and very often does so.\r\n\r\nAs to the shape of the Fan, it varies greatly according to the country,\r\nbut it may almost invariably be traced to some familiar object.\r\n\r\nThere is, for example, the common Japanese Fan or Screen, which is\r\navowedly made on the model of the Palm-leaf, the ribs of the leaf being\r\nrepresented by split portions of a bamboo stem. The right-hand figure in\r\nthe preceding illustration is taken from one of the common sixpenny\r\nJapanese fans that may be seen in many shop-windows.\r\n\r\nThere are exactly sixty ribs in the fan, all produced by splitting the\r\nbamboo into strips, kept in their place by a slight rod of the same\r\nmaterial, and covered with two pieces of thin printed paper. Seeing that\r\nthe original cost cannot be more than a penny, it is wonderful how such\r\narticles can be produced, and give a living to the makers.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that the shape of the Japanese Fan is almost\r\nexactly that of the Palm-leaf, with the exception of the jagged edges,\r\nand a better pattern could not be found. Then there are many Indian Fans\r\nframed on the same model, but which revolve on their handles, and are\r\nswung slowly round and round by the servants before the guests, and thus\r\nbecome miniature punkahs.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we may find a parallel in Nature. The common hive bee\r\nventilates its dwelling by using its wings in lieu of fans. When the\r\nhive is really in want of fresh air, the bees set to work, and wave\r\ntheir wings backwards and forwards for a considerable time, so that they\r\nnecessarily expel the foul air from the interior of the hive, and create\r\na partial vacuum, which can only be filled by fresh air from without.\r\n\r\nFans of very similar shape are in use among the South Sea Islanders and\r\nthe inhabitants of the Essequibo district. They are often used as\r\nbellows when a fire has to be raised, but their primary object is to be\r\nemployed as fans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT we come to those fans which are made of flattened sticks, which\r\nmove on a pivot. This is, indeed, the ordinary form of the fan at the\r\npresent day, the sticks being sometimes wide enough to constitute the\r\nentire fan, but mostly being connected with a sort of lining made with\r\nsilk, paper, or feathers. Such fans as these can be moved on their\r\npivots, so as to occupy a comparatively small space; and the same can\r\nbe said of the modern fender-guards, which can be folded up when the\r\nroom is unoccupied, and which form an effectual protection against the\r\ndanger of ladies’ dresses coming in contact with the fire.\r\n\r\nExamples of such a screen, and two fans, are given on the right hand of\r\nthe accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTENNA OF COCKCHAFER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nIVORY FAN.         FEATHER FAN.\r\n\r\nFIRE-GUARD.]\r\n\r\nOn the left hand is shown one of the natural objects from which the\r\nfans, &c., might well have derived their origin. It is one of the\r\nantennæ--or horns, as they are popularly called--of the common\r\nCockchafer. The end of this antenna is composed of a number of flat\r\nplates, which work on a pivot exactly like the sticks of a fan, and,\r\nlike those sticks, can be folded into a wonderfully small compass, or\r\nopened out into a fan-like shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL.\r\n\r\nLast scene of all.\r\n\r\nI do not think that it matters very much to one who has “shuffled off\r\nthis mortal coil” what becomes of the coil in which he had been\r\nimprisoned. Whether the abandoned body be buried in the earth, or sunk\r\nin the sea, or devoured by wild beasts, or consumed by fire, signifies\r\nnothing to him, though it may signify much to his surviving friends.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the animals, of whatever kind they may be, contrive to\r\ndispose of their mortal remains in some mysterious manner, so that not\r\na vestige of them is to be found. Take, for example, the domestic cat,\r\nand see how few bodies are found of cats which have died natural deaths.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there was my own cat “Pret,” who lost his life from the\r\nbites of rats. He was blind, and so lamed that he could scarcely crawl.\r\nYet, on the day of his death, he three times escaped from his\r\ncomfortable bed in front of the fire, dragged himself through a hedge,\r\ndown a steep bank, across a road, up another bank, through a crevice in\r\na park fence, and curled himself up to die under a blackberry-bush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURYING-ANTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAVAGE FUNERAL.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was mistaken kindness on my part, and I should have acted\r\nbetter if I had left him to die in peace. But, though I carried him back\r\nthree times, and though he was quite unable to see, he contrived to slip\r\nout of the house, and to find the same spot for his last resting-place\r\non this earth.\r\n\r\nI have heard that some cats have been known to bury their young, and Dr.\r\nJ. Brown tells a most touching story of a dog that committed her dead\r\npuppy to the river.\r\n\r\nBut as to Insects, until a few years ago, no one ever dreamed that the\r\nprinciple of burial could be found among them. What millions of insects\r\ndie in every year, and how seldom is a dead insect found! Flies, gnats,\r\nand the smaller insects might escape observation, but the large moths,\r\nbutterflies, beetles, dragon-flies, &c., are scarcely ever found dead.\r\n\r\nIn my own neighbourhood, for example, the Stag-beetle, nearly the\r\nlargest and most conspicuous of British insects, swarms to an almost\r\nunpleasant degree, especially in the summer evenings.\r\n\r\nYet I have never found a dead Stag-beetle that had not been killed by\r\nviolence. What becomes of the bodies of the countless millions of\r\ncreatures that annually pass into their other world is a problem which\r\nat present no one seems to be able to solve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTILL, there are instances where even insects are known to bury their\r\ndead, and I scarcely need say that they are to be found among the Ants.\r\n\r\nThe story is a very curious one, and is narrated at length in the\r\n_Journal of the Linnæan Society_, vol. v. p. 217.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a lady found that her little boy was being stung by\r\nants, and she at once killed them and threw their dead bodies away.\r\nAfter some time a number of ants came out of their nest, formed a\r\nprocession as regularly organized as that of any undertaker’s funeral,\r\ndug graves for each dead ant, laid the body in it, and covered it up\r\nagain with earth.\r\n\r\nThey carried their organization to such an extent that they even had\r\nrelays of bearers. But the strangest part of the story is that several\r\nworker ants would not assist in the funereal ceremonies. The soldiers at\r\nonce set on them, killed them, and tumbled them all promiscuously into a\r\ncommon grave.\r\n\r\nSuch scenes were repeatedly witnessed by the lady, a Mrs. Hutton, who\r\nwrote the account while she was living in New South Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWATER, AND MEANS OF PROCURING IT.\r\n\r\n     The Necessity of Water to Man.--Composition of the Human\r\n     Body.--Natural and Artificial Distillation.--The Traveller’s\r\n     Tree.--Pitcher-plants and Monkey-pots.--Stomach of the Camel, and\r\n     its Analogy to the Honey-comb.--Dewdrops.--Use of the Still at\r\n     Sea.--Perspiration and its cooling Properties.--The Turkish\r\n     Bath.--Perfume and Ether Spray.--Condenser of the Low-pressure\r\n     Steam-engine.--The Dry and Wet Bulb Thermometer.--Ice produced in a\r\n     red-hot Vessel.--Power of Water.--How Fountains are made.--Modern\r\n     System of Hydrants.--Hydraulic Mining.--The Victoria and Niagara\r\n     Falls.--Artesian Wells.--The Norton Tube, &c., in Abyssinia.--The\r\n     Water-ram and Spout-hole.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT has often been remarked that man can live a comparatively long time\r\nwithout solid food, providing that he can only obtain water, of which\r\nthe chief bulk of the human body is made. Dying by thirst is a horribly\r\npainful death, but, according to Mr. Mills, the ill-fated Australian\r\ntraveller, “starvation on nardoo (an innutritious plant) is by no means\r\nunpleasant, but from the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to\r\nmove one’s self.”\r\n\r\nThose who have been shipwrecked, and unable to obtain fresh water, have\r\nalways found that the tortures of thirst were infinitely harder to\r\nendure than those of hunger; and the reader will probably remember that\r\nthose who perished in the Black Hole of Calcutta owed their deaths\r\nchiefly to thirst, their bodies being exhausted of moisture by the heat\r\nof the room, and no fresh supply attainable.\r\n\r\nCivilisation especially shows itself in the way in which water is\r\nbrought within the reach of every one, even in the most crowded of\r\ncities. The reader may probably call to mind the wonderful aqueducts of\r\nancient Rome, the gigantic remains of which still exist. Then, as to\r\nour own country, we are all practically acquainted with some water\r\ncompany, by which the water, more or less purified, is brought into our\r\nhouses, and can be obtained by the mere turning of a tap.\r\n\r\nYet all this ingenuity is but a following of natural prototypes, as will\r\npresently be seen; and even the familiar Water-tank, as shown at the\r\nright hand of the illustration, has been anticipated by Nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration there are three examples of natural\r\nwater-tanks, two belonging to the vegetable, and one to the animal\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTRAVELLER’S TREE.\r\n\r\nSTOMACH OF CAMEL.\r\n\r\nPITCHER-PLANT.\r\n\r\nCISTERN.]\r\n\r\nThat on the extreme left, with a number of radiations, represents a\r\nportion of a Madagascar palm, popularly called the Traveller’s Tree.\r\nHaving very large leaves, arranged in the manner there shown, the\r\nTraveller’s Tree condenses the nightly dews, and allows them to trickle\r\ndown into the hollows of the leaf-stems.\r\n\r\nThere the water remains, out of the reach of sunbeams or wind, and if a\r\ntraveller happens to be thirsty, all he has to do is to pierce the base\r\nof one of these gigantic leaves, and out rushes a stream of the purest\r\nwater, as is shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT to the Traveller’s Tree is shown one of those extraordinary\r\nvegetables called Pitcher-plants, from the strange conformation of the\r\nleaves. They inhabit Borneo, Siam, and other hot countries. In these\r\nremarkable plants some of the leaves are developed into suitable\r\npitchers, with hinged lids, exactly like our hot-water jugs. They serve,\r\nhowever, a different office, and contain cold water which the plant has\r\ndistilled from the dew.\r\n\r\nAs the monkeys are in the habit of resorting to these plants when\r\nthirsty, they are sometimes called Monkey-pots. There is an admirable\r\naccount of the Pitcher-plants and their development in the _Transactions\r\nof the Linnæan Society_, vol. xxii. part iv. The scientific name of\r\nthose plants is Nepenthes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBELOW the vegetable comes a rather celebrated animal cistern, namely, a\r\nportion of one of the stomachs of a Camel.\r\n\r\nIt exactly corresponds with that part of an ox which butchers call\r\n“honey-comb tripe,” and consists of a multitude of cells, which can be\r\nclosed or opened at will. When the camel takes in its provision of\r\nwater, it can treat this portion of the stomach much as the hive bee\r\ntreats the honey-bag, and fill its cells with water.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, when it finds the necessity for moisture, it can squeeze the\r\nwater out of these receptacles into the digestive portion of the\r\ninterior, and so can sustain life for a wonderfully long time under\r\nconditions which would kill any other animal. I may remark, by the way,\r\nthat the amount which a camel can drink, and the length of time through\r\nwhich it can endure its desert life, have been much exaggerated. There\r\nis another point to be considered, namely, the curious resemblance\r\nbetween these cells and the honey-comb of the hive bee. Every one knows\r\nthat honey, no matter how tightly closed, will crystallize and lose its\r\nbest qualities if kept in jars, whereas if it be allowed to remain in\r\nthe waxen comb, where it is divided into very small portions, it will\r\nremain good for years.\r\n\r\nIt is just the same with the cells of the camel’s stomach, they being\r\nable to preserve water in a pure state by distributing it among a number\r\nof small cells, which can be opened or closed at will.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the various means of obtaining water.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the Filter, by which foul water can\r\nbe made pure for human consumption, and we will therefore pass to\r\nanother mode of obtaining pure water, namely, the Still.\r\n\r\nIn former days, if there were a failure of the supply of fresh water on\r\nboard ship, the whole of the occupants must necessarily perish. Now,\r\nhowever, no such danger exists, as every well-furnished ship carries at\r\nleast one Still, by means of which the sea-water can be made to abandon\r\nits salt, and to give out nothing but pure water fit for drinking.\r\n\r\nEven in cases where no regular Still has been on board, an extemporised\r\nStill has been made from a kettle, a gun barrel, or piece of lead\r\npiping, or anything of a similar nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEWDROPS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STILL.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the Still is simple enough, and is shown by the\r\ndiagram, rather than drawing, on the right hand of the illustration.\r\nThere is a vessel in which liquid is boiled. From the upper part of it\r\nrises a tube through which the steam must pass as it is generated. The\r\ntube in question is generally of considerable length, and is coiled\r\ninside a vessel filled with cold water, rendered colder by ice, if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAs the steam passes through the cold tube condensation takes place, and\r\nit becomes liquid again, but deprived of its heavier particles, so that\r\nif sea-water be placed in the still, the salt is left in the vessel, and\r\nnothing but pure water passes through the tube. In dissecting-rooms a\r\nsmall still is almost invariably kept. Many preparations are of such a\r\nnature that the spirit in which they are placed becomes discoloured, and\r\nhas to be repeatedly changed. Now, even methylated spirit is an\r\nexpensive article, and therefore, instead of being thrown away, the\r\ndiscoloured spirit is placed in the still, and reproduced in a clean and\r\ntransparent state.\r\n\r\nNature affords innumerable examples of distillation, the chief of which\r\nare the Dewdrops which have already been mentioned. During the daytime\r\nthe air is full of moisture drawn by the sunbeams from ocean. We cannot\r\nsee it, but it is there, and when the chill of night cools the various\r\ntrees, herbage, and other such objects, the aërial moisture is condensed\r\nupon them, which is then known by the name of Dew.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the illustration are shown the tiny Dewdrops as\r\nhanging on the slight threads of a spider’s web, and collected in larger\r\ndrops upon a leaf.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE are many other familiar examples of the principle of condensation,\r\nthe commonest of which is the so-called steam as it pours from the spout\r\nof a kettle. In point of fact, it is not steam at all, but only water\r\ncondensed into very small drops. At the orifice of the kettle it is\r\nquite invisible, but when it passes into the air, and is condensed, the\r\ntiny globules become visible. The same fact may be noticed in the\r\nNapier’s Coffee Machine, which has already been mentioned. When the\r\nwater is boiling in the glass globe no steam is visible, though the\r\nupper portion of the globe is entirely filled by it. But, no sooner is\r\nthe cork removed, and the steam allowed to escape, than it at once\r\nbecomes visible as a white cloud, being, indeed, a miniature copy of the\r\nrain-clouds that float above us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHEN there is that mostly invisible passage of liquid through the\r\nmultitudinous pores of the body, which is generally known as\r\nperspiration. It is invisible in warm weather, but on a cold day is as\r\nvisible as a rain cloud.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Bath affords a good example of this fact. Sometimes the\r\nhottest room attains a temperature of 250° or more, water boiling at\r\n212°. When a bather goes into that room, he appears to have a perfectly\r\ndry skin, the moisture being in the form of invisible steam, and swept\r\noff as soon as it is generated.\r\n\r\nBut, if he passes at once into the cold room, he is so enveloped in\r\nvapour that for a few moments he is wrapped in it as in a cloud, and\r\ncan scarcely be seen, the vapour having been condensed by the cold air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nHEATED HORSE.\r\n\r\nPERFUME SPRAY.\r\n\r\nFREEZING BY EVAPORATION.\r\n\r\nWET-BULB\r\nTHERMOMETER.]\r\n\r\nA very familiar instance of this sudden condensation may be seen in the\r\nstreets of London on any winter day. There may be a couple of omnibus\r\nhorses, nearly at the end of their day’s work, and quite tired out.\r\nSuddenly they are pulled up by the driver, and as suddenly disappear for\r\na moment or two, being concealed in a cloud of moisture proceeding from\r\ntheir bodies. Of course in a hot day there is more of the moisture, but\r\nthe warmth of the atmosphere prevents it from condensation, and so it is\r\nnot visible.\r\n\r\nOne valuable property of the system of evaporation and condensation is\r\nits cooling power. Thus it is that a person who is ill with fever tosses\r\nabout with a burning skin until the pores of the body act, and allow the\r\nnormal moisture to pass through them. Then the body cools by\r\nevaporation, and the patient begins to amend.\r\n\r\nSo it is that the bather can endure in the Turkish bath a heat so great\r\nthat a glass of water, if held in the hand, would speedily boil, and a\r\npiece of meat be cooked in about the same period. But, if the air were\r\nnot dry enough to carry off the perspiration, the bather would be\r\nscalded to death.\r\n\r\nA most valuable adaptation of the principle is shown in the little\r\nglass machine for dispersing perfumes in the form of spray. In cases of\r\nheadache it is almost invaluable, the spray cooling the heated forehead,\r\nlike magic, and at the same time filling the room with the grateful\r\nperfume.\r\n\r\nIt has even a greater claim to human gratitude, as I can personally\r\ntestify. I have the strongest objection to a surgeon’s knife, especially\r\nwhen I know, from sad experience, that he is going to make very free use\r\nof it. But, on the last occasion, I cared nothing for it, owing to the\r\nhappy invention called Ether Spray.\r\n\r\nThe effects were remarkable. First, a delicious cooling of a spot raging\r\nwith internal fires. Then it was rather colder than I liked. Then it was\r\nmuch colder than I liked. Then it became almost too cold to bear,\r\nreminding me of my childhood’s feet on the outside of the Birmingham\r\ncoach in the depth of winter.\r\n\r\nSuddenly all sensation ceased, and the skin became white as parchment.\r\nOut came the surgeon’s bistoury, and I looked at him with as calm\r\ncomposure as if he had been whittling a deal plank. There was absolutely\r\nno feeling whatever, the local nerves having been temporarily frozen, so\r\ngreat is the power of evaporation. If it ever be my lot again to endure\r\ncold steel, I shall have the ether spray.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the extreme right of the illustration is seen the “Wet-bulb”\r\nThermometer, which carries out the same principle, the thermometer being\r\ndouble, and one bulb being covered with a wet envelope, while the other\r\nis dry.\r\n\r\nBelow is one of the many inventions for making artificial ice, all of\r\nthem depending on the cooling power of evaporation. Perhaps some of my\r\nreaders may have seen molten iron poured over the human hand without\r\ndoing the least harm, or mercury frozen in a red, or rather a white, hot\r\nvessel. Both these phenomena are due to the cooling power of\r\nevaporation, which is made to act with extreme rapidity, and so absorbs\r\nthe heat until even mercury is rendered solid, and can be cast in a\r\nmould like a leaden bullet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the accompanying illustration we have an example of the Condensating\r\nprinciple as applied to the steam-engine, and popularly known as the\r\n“Low-pressure Engine.” In this case force is reconverted, so to speak,\r\nand, if a cubic inch of water has been converted by heat into a cubic\r\nfoot of steam, creating a pressure in one direction, it can be\r\nreconverted by cold, and so produce a pressure in another direction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is owing to this fact that some parts of the world are always hot and\r\nalways wet, Guiana being a striking example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAIN-CLOUD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONDENSER.]\r\n\r\nThe wind blows over the ocean, absorbing moisture as a sponge does\r\nwater. As it passes from the sea over the land, it is met by secondary\r\nmountain ranges, too low to arrest its progress altogether, and high\r\nenough to have their summits clothed in eternal snows. As soon,\r\ntherefore, as the warm, water-laden winds pass over these mountains, the\r\nmoisture is condensed by their frozen tips, and down rushes the rain in\r\ntorrents.\r\n\r\nEven in our own temperate land we can often trace the cause of a heavy\r\nrain to the presence of a lofty hill, or even an exceptionally tall\r\nspire. The moist climate of Oxford has been attributed by scientific men\r\nquite as much to its spires and towers as to its low-lying situation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we come to the various modes of extracting the water which is laid\r\nup within the earth, and which only slowly ascends to the surface when\r\ndrawn up by the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nWater is everywhere, but the depths at which it is found are vastly\r\ndifferent. For example, at one house in which I lived it was not\r\npossible to dig for three feet without coming to water. In another, no\r\nwater was found within some two hundred feet, and, as I several times\r\nrelieved the old gardener of the task of drawing the water for the day’s\r\nconsumption, I have reason to remember the depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPRING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\nThe pail, rope, and winch which were in use at that time--and may be\r\nstill, to the sorrow of the gardener--are but a sort of semi-savage way\r\nof procuring water from the depths of the earth. It is a well-known fact\r\nthat under certain conditions water always finds its own level, _minus_\r\nthe friction of the channel through which it passes. On this principle\r\nall fountains are made. Those, for example, at the Crystal Palace, which\r\nfling their waters to such a height, are fed from tanks on the summit of\r\nthe two great water towers. And, were it not for the friction of the\r\nwater in the tubes, and that of the air, the fountains would rise as\r\nhigh as the tanks from which they are fed.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case with springs, especially with those of an intermittent\r\ncharacter, in which latter instance the rushing of the water is exactly\r\ncoincident with the filling of the hidden tank which supplies it.\r\n\r\nThe modern Hydrant system, which bids fair to supersede the cumbrous\r\nmachinery of fire-engines, even when worked by steam, is based on the\r\nsame principle. The water-tanks are placed at such a height that, when a\r\nhose is attached, and the tap turned, the water can be thrown over the\r\nroof of the highest building. Such hydrants have been attached to\r\nCanterbury Cathedral since the fire which so nearly consumed that\r\nmagnificent and venerable building.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA VERY remarkable use has been made of this power of water in mining\r\noperations. Most of my readers know that in gold mines the metal is\r\nchiefly found scattered among quartz, one of the hardest of the\r\nminerals. The usual plan has been to dig out the quartz, pound it to\r\npowder with specially devised machines called “stamps,” to pass the\r\npowder through mercury, which amalgamated with the gold, and gave it up\r\nagain on being heated to a certain temperature.\r\n\r\nNow a different mode of mining is brought into operation, the pickaxe,\r\nspade, and stamps, with all their expensive machinery, being abandoned,\r\nand water made to do the duty of all three, some ingenious individual\r\nhaving noticed the effect which water has on the hardest rock.\r\n\r\nSuch, for example, is the case with those wonderful Victoria Falls of\r\nAfrica, where the rushing water has cut its sinuous channel through so\r\nmany hundreds of yards of rock. Such, also, is the case with the more\r\ncelebrated, but not so wonderful, Falls of Niagara, which have been\r\ngradually working their way backwards, having worn away the rocks over\r\nwhich they fall, and which are shown to be many miles away from the spot\r\nwhere the river first discharged itself over the cliff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDRAULIC MINING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER-FALL.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is well known that the Falls are receding at a definite rate\r\nannually, and that the rate has been calculated with scientific\r\naccuracy. The cliffs of our own coasts-say of Margate or\r\nRamsgate--crumble away with equally calculable speed.\r\n\r\nIn the hydraulic mining system large tanks are erected, at least two\r\nhundred feet above the level of the mine. From these tanks proceed\r\npipes, terminated by hose, just like those of our ordinary fire-engines.\r\nThe miners, instead of using pickaxe or crowbar, simply direct the\r\nstreams of water against the solid rock. Their effect is tremendous.\r\nThey tear it to powder, and carry it down the wooden troughs called\r\n“flumes,” in which the mercury is so arranged that not a single atom of\r\nquartz rock can pass without having its gold extracted.\r\n\r\nThe following graphic account of Hydraulic Mining at Nevada is taken\r\nfrom Mr. J. K. Lord’s “Naturalist in British Columbia:”--\r\n\r\n“Near Nevada are the famed Hydraulic washings. The gold is disseminated\r\nthrough terraces of shingle conglomerates, often three hundred feet in\r\nthickness. These terraces are actually washed entirely off the face of\r\nthe country by propelling jets of water against them, forced by pressure\r\nthrough a nozzle.\r\n\r\n“To accomplish this, the water is brought in canals, tunnels, and wooden\r\naqueducts, often forty miles away from the ‘draft.’ This supply of water\r\nthe miners rent.\r\n\r\n“As we near the washing spot, in every direction immense hose, made of\r\ngalvanized iron, and canvas tubes six feet round, coil in all directions\r\nover the ground like gigantic serpents, converging towards a gap, where\r\nthey disappear.\r\n\r\n“On reaching this gap, I look down into a basin or dry lake, three\r\nhundred feet below me. The hose hangs down this cliff of shingle, and\r\nfollowing its course by a zigzag path, I reach a plateau of rock, from\r\nwhich the shingle has already been washed.\r\n\r\n“A man stands at the end of each hose, that has for its head a brass\r\nnozzle. With the force of cannon-shot, water issues in a large jet from\r\nthis tube, and propelled against the shingle, guided by the men, washes\r\nit away as easily as we could sweep a molehill from off the grass.\r\n\r\n“The stream of water, bearing with it the materials washed from out the\r\ncliff, runs through wooden troughs called ‘flumes,’ floored with\r\ngranite. These ‘flumes’ extend six miles. Men are stationed at regular\r\ndistances to fork out the heavy stones.\r\n\r\n“Throughout its entire length, transverse strips of wood dam back a tiny\r\npond of mercury. These are called _ruffles_--gold-traps, in other words,\r\nthat seize on the fine dust-gold distributed through the shingle. The\r\nflumes are cleaned about once a month, and the gold extracted from the\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\n“I try with a powerful lens to detect gold amidst the material they are\r\nwashing, but not a trace is discoverable, and yet it pays an immense\r\nprofit to the gold-washers.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE are two more modes of extracting water, which will be but\r\ncursorily mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that water finds its own level, and that the\r\nterrific power of hydraulic mining is owing to the fact that the water\r\nexpends its force against the solid rock instead of ascending into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTESIAN WELL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTON’S TUBE.]\r\n\r\nIt is now found that, even without artificial assistance, water has a\r\nhabit of finding its own level, and that, if it be allowed its own\r\ncourse, it will contrive to find its way nearly to the highest point\r\nwhence it derived its origin. On this principle are based the Artesian\r\nWells, which, when they “strike water,” spurt it up in a torrent, as is\r\nthe case with the now celebrated Norton Tubes, which are screwed down\r\ninto the earth like hollow gimlets, and which always contrive to extract\r\nthe water hidden beneath the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe success of our army in Abyssinia was greatly owing to these Norton\r\nTubes, which, being of small diameter and of peculiar make, could be\r\nscrewed into the ground when the troops made a halt, unscrewed when they\r\nleft the spot, and used again for the next halt.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the French used the Artesian-well system with wonderful\r\nsuccess in Northern Africa. Water is the chief necessity of life in that\r\npart of the world, and a nation who could cause pure cold water to\r\nspring out of the hot and thirsty sands was naturally looked upon as\r\nsomething more than human.\r\n\r\nYet the principle was exactly the same in both cases. Water is always\r\nlatent somewhere beneath the surface of the earth, and, if a tube can be\r\ndriven deep enough, the water will come up it.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows the Artesian Well and Norton’s Tube,\r\nand their similitude in principle, the tube penetrating through various\r\nlayers of soil, until it reaches the water which it seeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHEN there is another way by which water can be made to force itself to\r\na considerable height. Not being much of a mathematician, I do not\r\nrecollect the exact proportional height to which a stream of water may\r\nraise itself, but if any one can secure a fall of some eight or ten\r\nfeet, he can furnish his house with water by means of the “Ram,” a chart\r\nof which is shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPOUT-HOLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER-RAM.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the Ram is, that the water is allowed to flow down a\r\ntube, when it meets with a valve. This valve is suddenly closed by the\r\npressure, and the water is forced onwards by the shock. Much water\r\nescapes at each blow of the valve, but that does not signify.\r\n\r\nThe force of water thus suddenly stopped is hardly appreciated. Even in\r\nordinary houses the sudden turning of a water-tap has been known to\r\nburst the pipe and deluge the house with water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature a similar effect is produced, called popularly the\r\n“Spout-hole.”\r\n\r\nIt is a hole or tunnel on the seashore, passing upwards from the level\r\nof the sea to the summit of the cliff.\r\n\r\nWhen the waves are urged against the tunnel by the wind, the water is\r\ndashed into it. Being partially checked by the friction, which acts\r\nexactly like the water that is checked by the Ram, the wave hurls itself\r\nup the channel, and flies out in showers of spray, high above the level\r\nof the original wave which caused it.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration are shown the Water-ram with its globular valve, and\r\nthe safety or escape valve of the waste water. On the left is shown one\r\nof the natural Spout-holes, with the water dashing through its tunnel\r\ninto a mass of spray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAËROSTATICS.--WEIGHT OF AIR.--EXPANSION BY HEAT.\r\n\r\n     Ascent and Descent.--The Balloon and the Parachute.--Description of\r\n     the Balloon.--The Montgolfier Balloon.--Causes of its\r\n     Abandonment.--The Gas Balloon.--Hydrogen Gas and its\r\n     Manufacture.--The Gossamer Spider.--Reasons of its Ascent and\r\n     Descent.--Many Species of Gossamers.--Description of the\r\n     Parachute.--Its Mode of Action.--A Balloon converted into a\r\n     Parachute.--Toy Parachutes.--Natural Parachutes.--The Dandelion\r\n     Seed and its Structure.--The Flying Squirrel.--The Flying\r\n     Monkey.--Flying Mice and Flying Opossums.--The Flying Dragon and\r\n     its Pseudo-wings.--The Flying Frog.--Weight of Air.--Pressure per\r\n     Square Inch.--The Air Ocean and its Storms.--Principle of\r\n     Air-currents.--The Sun, the Earth, and the Air.--Ventilation of\r\n     Mines.--Choke-damp and Fire-damp.--The Air-shafts.--Chimneys of\r\n     Factories.--The Steam-blast.--The Barometer, and Mode of its\r\n     Construction.--Water and Mercury.--Sucking Eggs and\r\n     Sugar-cane.--Expansion of Water and Metals by Heat.--The\r\n     Thermometer.--Wheel-making.\r\n\r\n\r\nAËROSTATICS.\r\n\r\nWe will begin this chapter with the only two modes at present known by\r\nwhich man can ascend from the earth or descend to it with safety,\r\nnamely, the Balloon and the Parachute, the latter being generally\r\nattached to the former, and detachable at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Balloon is, in fact, as its name imports, a large, hollow, air-tight\r\nball, filled with some substance lighter than ordinary air. The original\r\nBalloons by Montgolfier were filled with heated air exactly like our toy\r\nfire-balloons. Just as the supply of hot air is kept up in them by a\r\nsponge dipped in lighted spirits of wine, so in Montgolfier’s balloons\r\nthe same object was attained by straw which was kept continually burning\r\nin a grate.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, two disadvantages about this plan. The first was\r\nthe great danger of fire, which on one occasion did ignite a balloon\r\nwhen at a great height. The second was the perpetual labour required in\r\nkeeping the fire alight. Straw burns very rapidly, and so the aëronaut\r\nhad no opportunity of making those meteorologic observations in which\r\nconsist almost the entire value of the balloon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOSSAMER SPIDER. BALLOON.]\r\n\r\nThen it was thought that hydrogen gas, being about fourteen times\r\nlighter than ordinary air, would answer the purpose, and such has proved\r\nto be the case. Formerly the gas was made at great expense from\r\nsulphuric acid and zinc, but it is now found that the common coal-gas is\r\nquite as efficient, very much cheaper, and fills the balloon much more\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE same principle, though not the same form, is found in Nature.\r\n\r\nThere are certain tiny spiders called Gossamers, which have a curious\r\npower of floating in the air. They have been seen on the tops of lofty\r\nspires, and they are sometimes so numerous that the air is full of their\r\nfloating webs, and the ground is white with those that have descended.\r\n\r\nTheir mode of ascent is this. They climb to the top of some elevated\r\nobject, if it be only a grass-blade. They then pour out a tuft of long,\r\nslender threads, which shortly begin to tend upwards. As soon as the\r\nSpider feels the pull, it crawls upon the web, and sails away into the\r\nair. The duration and height of the ascent depend much on the wind and\r\ncharacter of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe web ascends because it is for the time lighter than the atmosphere.\r\nBut, as it gradually becomes laden with the moisture that more or less\r\nfills the air, it becomes heavier than the atmosphere, and gently sinks\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nWhat may be the object of these aërial voyages no one knows. They may be\r\nfor the purpose of capturing minute insects, or they may be for mere\r\namusement. But in either case they are highly instructive, as showing\r\nthe principle on which the balloon was framed.\r\n\r\nThe little Gossamer Spider is shown on the left hand of the\r\nillustration, clinging to its floating web. I believe that the Gossamer\r\nis not a single species of Spider, but that there are many species which\r\ndeserve the name, being able to float in the air when they are small,\r\nbut losing that capacity as they increase in size and weight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we come to another branch of the same subject, namely, the safe\r\ndescent from a great height by means of the Parachute.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration is the ordinary Parachute as it\r\nappears when open and closed, in either case having somewhat the\r\nappearance of a large umbrella. It is hung to the balloon in its closed\r\nstate, and when detached it falls rapidly for a yard or two with\r\nstartling rapidity. The pressure of the air thus forces the ribs open,\r\nand gives sufficient assistance to the atmosphere to insure a gentle\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nOn one memorable occasion, when the late Albert Smith was in the car of\r\na balloon upwards of a mile from the ground, the balloon burst.\r\nFortunately it burst so completely, that the silk was driven into the\r\nclosely meshed netting, and formed an extemporised parachute, which took\r\nthe voyagers to the earth with safety, except some rather severe\r\nbruises.\r\n\r\nChildren often amuse themselves with miniature parachutes. They take a\r\nsquare piece of thin paper, tie threads to the four corners, and then\r\nbring the ends together, a cork taking the place of the car. They then\r\nlaunch it from a high window, and should there be a favourable breeze,\r\nit is wonderful how far it will be carried before it comes to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nOnce, when a boy of eleven, and consequently thoughtless, I set a\r\nchimney on fire by one of these Parachutes. I wished to see whether it\r\nwould go up the chimney, and come out at the top. Unfortunately it was\r\ncaught by a flame as it was launched, flew up in full blaze, and, as the\r\nchimney needed sweeping, the result was inevitable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFLYING SQUIRREL.     DANDELION SEED         PARACHUTE\r\nFLYING DRAGON.      (OPEN AND CLOSED).  (OPEN AND CLOSED).\r\nFLYING FROG.]\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the illustrations, and at the top, are two examples of\r\na well-known natural Parachute called the Dandelion seed. The\r\nresemblance to the real Parachute is wonderful, the actual seed\r\noccupying the place of the car, and fulfilling the same office, _i.e._\r\nkeeping the seed upright until it reaches the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen the tuft is closed, as is the case before the pretty ball of seeds\r\nbursts from the green envelope in which they had been confined during\r\nthe process of development, its form bears the same startling\r\nresemblance to the Parachute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSING from the vegetable world, there will be seen three examples of\r\nNatural Parachutes. Several others will be mentioned, but we have no\r\nspace for description or figure. It will be seen, however, that the one\r\nprinciple which characterizes them all is the exposure to the air of a\r\nflattened and large surface, in proportion to the size of the object.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning the description, however, I must mention that nearly\r\nall animal parachutes can to a certain extent guide their course, while\r\nneither the balloon, the gossamer, the parachute, nor the various winged\r\nseeds have the least power of guidance, but must follow every current of\r\nair in which they may happen to float.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE upper figure represents a Flying Squirrel.\r\n\r\nThere are many species of Flying Squirrel, but they all agree in one\r\npoint. The skin of their sides is modified into a very thin fold, which\r\nextends as far as the feet.\r\n\r\nIt is very elastic, so that when it is not in use it falls into folds or\r\nwrinkles, and is hardly perceptible. But should the Squirrel wish to\r\npass from one tree to another, without coming to the ground, it spreads\r\nits legs as widely as possible, so as to stretch the membrane into a\r\nwide, flat surface. It then boldly springs into the air, and sweeps upon\r\nits mark with a sort of skimming movement. Except that it does not\r\nrevolve, it passes through the air much after the fashion of an\r\noyster-shell when thrown horizontally.\r\n\r\nMany mammalia are constructed after a similar fashion, such as the\r\nColugo, or Flying Monkey, the Flying Mice, and the Flying Phalangists,\r\nor “Opossums,” as they are popularly called.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the centre is the Flying Dragon, or small lizard, which very probably\r\ngave rise to the fabled Dragons in which our ancestors so devoutly\r\nbelieved. Indeed, on looking back at the old illustrated works on\r\nNatural History, there can be but little doubt on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn this creature, the ribs, instead of the legs, carry the flat and\r\nelastic membranes. When simply crawling on the branches, after the\r\nmanner of tree-lizards, the ribs lie flat against the sides, and the\r\nmembranes collapse, so that the shape of the body is little different\r\nfrom that of any crawling lizard.\r\n\r\nBut the ribs are movable at will, and, when the creature wishes to pass\r\nfrom one tree to another, it extends the ribs, stretches the membranes,\r\nand launches itself into the air, exactly as has been narrated of the\r\nFlying Squirrel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE lowest figure represents a most extraordinary animal, called the\r\nFlying Frog. Only one specimen is believed to be known, and that was\r\ndiscovered in Borneo by Mr. Wallace.\r\n\r\nHere we have an analogy with the bats of the present day and the\r\npterodactyles of the past, namely, the elongation of the toes, and the\r\nstretching of a web between them. In the two latter animals, however,\r\nonly the toes of the two fore-legs are elongated, whereas, with the\r\nFlying Frog, the elongation is found in both pairs of limbs. The ends of\r\nthe toes are furnished with adhesive pads, like those of the tree-frogs,\r\nto which it is probably related.\r\n\r\nBy means of the four membranes, the creature is able to sweep through\r\nthe air for some distance, and, indeed, this power was the reason why it\r\nwas caught. It was seen to skim from one tree to another, and was\r\nimmediately secured. Had it remained sticking on the tree, it would\r\nprobably have escaped observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF AIR.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed that hydrogen gas is fourteen times lighter than\r\nair, and infer necessarily that the weight of the atmosphere must be\r\nvery considerable if so heavy an object as a balloon, with its car,\r\ninstruments, sand-bags, and passengers, can rise and float in it.\r\n\r\nWe are not conscious of its weight, because it permeates us, and the\r\npressure is neutralised. But, in fact, we live at the bottom of a vast\r\nocean which we call the atmosphere; and as, on an average, there is a\r\npressure of fifteen pounds on every square inch of surface, we have to\r\nsustain an almost incredible weight. Let, for example, any one measure\r\nthe surface of his own hand, reduce it to square inches, add together\r\nfifteen pounds for every square inch, and he will then appreciate the\r\nweight of the atmospheric ocean in which we live. On an average, every\r\nhuman being endures a pressure of some ninety thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThis ocean is in perpetual movement, sometimes violently, which we call\r\nstorm; sometimes gently, which we call breeze; and sometimes very\r\ngently, which we call calm. There are air-spouts as well as\r\nwater-spouts; and, in fact, the water-spout is nothing but a continuance\r\nof the air-spout, as is shown by the moving sand-columns of the desert.\r\nWhatever may be the character of the winds, as we call this movement,\r\nthe air is never for a moment still; and, indeed, were it to be still\r\nfor any time, the whole human race would perish.\r\n\r\nHow winds are caused we shall see by the aid of the diagram on the\r\nleft-hand side of the illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AIR-CURRENTS. VENTILATION OF MINES.]\r\n\r\nThe original cause is the sun. His rays fall upon the earth, heating it,\r\nand so by radiation heating the air. Now, as has been remarked, heated\r\nair will cause a heavy balloon to float through ordinary air, and to\r\ncarry up a considerable amount of dead weight besides; consequently the\r\nheated air must ascend, while cool and heavier air rushes in to take its\r\nplace, and thus the currents are produced. Were the earth set straight\r\nupright, the currents would invariably run in one direction; but, as it\r\nis tilted on one side, the needful variety is obtained, and we find the\r\nwinds blowing from all parts of the compass.\r\n\r\nThe principle, therefore, of all winds is, that heat expands, and\r\ntherefore becomes lighter than air at an ordinary temperature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWERE it not that man has taken advantage of this principle, there could\r\nnot be a deep mine in England. In any deep excavation, even though it be\r\na well, foul air, mostly composed of carbonic acid gas, always collects,\r\nand, being much heavier than atmospheric air, lies at the bottom of the\r\npit as surely as hydrogen would rise out of it. To breathe this air is\r\nas certain and as sudden death as to take prussic acid, and no mine can\r\nbe worked as long as “choke-damp” is in it.\r\n\r\nIn coal mines there is an additional source of danger, namely, the coal\r\ngas, which is nearly identical with our coal gas of the streets, and\r\ntakes fire when brought into contact with flame. To rid the mines of\r\nthese gases, a simple, ingenious, and effectual remedy is used. A\r\nventilating shaft is made, which reaches from the bottom to the mouth of\r\nthe pit. At the bottom, diagonal shafts are made, entering the main\r\nshaft, as shown on the right hand of the illustration. One of these is\r\nconnected with a furnace, and the other, or others, open into the mine.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the furnace rarefies the air in the shaft, causing it to\r\nrush upwards with great violence, and so, by creating a partial vacuum,\r\nto force the air in the shaft to follow it. The loss of air thus caused\r\nis supplied by fresh air from above, which, by the law already\r\ndescribed, is obliged to take the place of that which was driven out.\r\nThus a complete circulation of air is kept up, and a well-managed mine\r\nhas a fresher atmosphere than many houses in which the windows are\r\nmostly kept shut, and the only ventilation is accomplished by\r\noccasionally open doors.\r\n\r\nThe “draught” of our domestic chimneys is owing to this principle, and\r\nthe reason why factory chimneys are built of such enormous height is,\r\nthat the column of heated air may be increased, and consequently that\r\nthe draught may be stronger, and the heat of the furnace made fiercer.\r\n\r\nThe “Steam-blast,” by which the escape steam of engines is sent into the\r\nchimney, is another example of this principle, the steam taking the\r\nplace of the hot air.\r\n\r\nFurther examples of the weight of the atmosphere are given in the\r\nillustration. That on the right represents the common Wheel Barometer,\r\nwhich marks the weight of the air by a hand moving in front of a dial.\r\nIf the hand moves towards the right, the weight of the air is\r\nincreasing; if to the left, it is decreasing.\r\n\r\nThere are certain words, such as Wet, Change, Fair, Dry, &c., on the\r\nface of the dial, but they are only conventional, the real test of the\r\nweather being the direction in which the hand moves. For example, if\r\nwith a west wind the hand moves from Dry towards Fair, rain may be\r\nexpected; whereas, if it should move from Wet to Change with an east\r\nwind, we may reasonably think that fine weather is coming.\r\n\r\nThe whole cause of this revolution of the hand may be found in the\r\nweight of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt is found that a column of water thirty feet high, or a column of\r\nmercury thirty inches high, is exactly equal in weight to a column of\r\nair of the same diameter, but some forty odd miles high, so that the two\r\ncolumns precisely balance each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUCKING SUGAR-CANE. SUCKING AN EGG. BAROMETERS.]\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, the water or mercury to be placed in tubes closed at the\r\ntop and open at the bottom, the water or mercury will exactly balance\r\nthe air, and will not escape from the tubes. It necessarily follows that\r\nif the air be heavier than usual, it will force the liquid higher into\r\nthe tubes, and, if it be lighter than usual, will allow them to fall\r\nlower. This is the principle of the Barometer.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the hand and dial is shown in the diagram which\r\noccupies the centre of the illustration. For convenience, sake the\r\nmercury column is mostly employed, but several Water Barometers, some\r\nthirty feet in length, have been constructed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand is seen a boy engaged in sucking an egg. The plan\r\nemployed is simple enough. A tolerably large hole is made at one end,\r\nand a very small one at the other. The yolk having been broken up by a\r\nlong needle, or similar implement, the larger hole is placed to the\r\nlips, and, suction being used, the contents pass into the mouth.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the hole at the end opposite the mouth, it would be\r\nimpossible to extract the contents, but the air rushes through the\r\naperture, and so forces out the contents of the egg.\r\n\r\nAbove is a representation of the way in which Sugar-cane is sucked. The\r\nreader probably knows that the Sugar-cane, like the wheat-stem, has\r\nknots at certain intervals, which divide the cane into a number of\r\nseparate parts.\r\n\r\nThere is quite an art in sucking the Sugar-cane. If a joint be cut off,\r\nand the lips applied to the end, not a drop of the sweet juice would be\r\nextracted. But if a notch be cut close to the joint, as shown in the\r\nillustration, the air can gain access, and then the juice flows easily\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILING WATER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERMOMETER.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that air expands when heated. The same\r\nrule holds good when applied to other objects, such as the various\r\nliquids, metals, &c. A very familiar example of this fact is the\r\n“boiling over” of water, when the vessel has been filled too much to\r\nallow for the expansion of the heated liquid.\r\n\r\nAdvantage has been taken of this principle in the formation of the\r\nThermometer, a word which signifies “heat-measurer.” Liquid of some kind\r\nis placed in an hermetically sealed tube, generally terminating with a\r\nbulb, and in proportion to the heat the liquid expands, and is forced up\r\nthe tube.\r\n\r\nAny liquid will answer to a certain extent, but, as water freezes at\r\n32°, it would be useless for measuring degrees of cold below the\r\nfreezing point. Coloured spirits of wine are used; but the very best\r\nliquid is mercury, which is a metal in a state of fusion.\r\n\r\nThis expansion by heat is so powerful in iron, that it is utilised in\r\nseveral ways.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, wheel-making. The iron tire is made rather smaller\r\nthan the wheel, and is then placed in a fire until it is red-hot. It\r\nthen expands so much that it can be easily slipped over the wheel as it\r\nlies on the ground. Cold water is then dashed on it, and the tire\r\ncontracts with tremendous force, binding the parts of the wheel firmly\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn all buildings where iron is much used, such as iron bridges, iron\r\nbeams, &c., it is necessary to make allowance at both ends, so as to\r\npermit the iron to expand on a hot day and contract on a cool one.\r\nBuildings formed of stone and iron were once thought to be safe in case\r\nof fire. They are now known to be just the contrary, the stone flying\r\nwith the heat, and the iron expanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     The Cassava Press and its Structure.--Mode of using it.--The\r\n     Siamese Link.--An ingenious Robbery.--Muscles and their Mode of\r\n     Action.--Human Arms and Steelyard.--Change of Direction.--The Human\r\n     Hand and Wrist.--Story of a Carpenter.--The Pulley.--Reduction by\r\n     Friction.--Past and present Engines.--Oiling Machines.--Treatment\r\n     of the Sewing Machine.--Use of Paraffine.--Disuse of Machine\r\n     hurtful.--Human Joints.--Synovia and its Value.--Disuse of Joints\r\n     hurtful.--The Lazy-tongs and its Usefulness to\r\n     Invalids.--Suggestions for Improvement.--Larva of the Dragonfly and\r\n     its Mask.--Curious Mode of seizing Prey.--Proboscis of the\r\n     Housefly, and Mode of using it.--The Apple-parer.--Squirrel and\r\n     Nut.--Structure of Teeth.--Rock-splitting.--Powers of Ice.--How the\r\n     Pebble-ridge is formed.--Splitting Stones by Moisture.--The Diamond\r\n     Drill.--Ovipositor of the Gad-fly.--Curious Similitude of\r\n     Structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS AND APPLIANCES.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we will take some miscellaneous appliances of force both\r\nin Art and Nature.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration is shown the Cassava Press of Southern\r\nAmerica, a most effective and simple instrument for extracting the\r\njuices of the root. These juices are poisonous when raw, but, when\r\nproperly boiled and cooked, they make an excellent sauce.\r\n\r\nThe press in question is an elastic tube made of flat strips of cane\r\nwoven together exactly like the “Siamese Link,” which will be presently\r\ndescribed. The cassava root, after having been scraped until it\r\nresembles horseradish, is forced into the press until it can hold no\r\nmore. The result is, that the tube is shortened and thickened, being\r\nwidest in the middle.\r\n\r\nIt is then hung by its upper loop to the horizontal beam of a hut. A\r\nlong pole is passed through the lower loop, the short end is placed\r\nunder a projecting peg on the upright post of the house, and a heavy\r\nweight attached to the longer end. A powerful leverage is thus obtained,\r\nthe tube is forcibly shortened, and the juice exudes through the\r\napertures of the woven cane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASSAVA PRESS.]\r\n\r\nWhen it begins to run slowly, a woman seats herself at the end of the\r\npole, so as to increase its weight. I must mention here that in the\r\nillustration the press is too near the middle of the pole. This is\r\nbecause the exigences of our page do not admit of the requisite length.\r\nBut if the reader will kindly assume the end to which the stone is\r\nattached to be three or four times longer, he will have an idea of the\r\ngreat power which is exerted upon the cassava.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the illustration is the same cassava press as seen\r\nwhen empty, and both figures, as well as that of the pot for receiving\r\nthe juice, are taken from specimens in my collection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the right hand of the following illustration is the Siamese Link,\r\nwhich caused such a sensation when it first came out.\r\n\r\nA finger is inserted at each end, and, when the owner attempts to\r\nwithdraw them, the Link contracts, and the harder the pull, the tighter\r\nis the hold. If the fourth instead of the first finger be employed, the\r\nhold of the Link is exceedingly strong.\r\n\r\nThe only mode of release is by pushing the fingers together, when the\r\nLink will relax. It should then be held by the remaining fingers of one\r\nhand, so that it shall not contract again, and the finger of the other\r\nhand comes out at once.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious robbery was once committed by means of the Siamese Link. A\r\nman of good address struck up an acquaintance with a jeweller. One day\r\nhe produced a Siamese Link, and challenged him to get his fingers out\r\nwhen once they were in. So the jeweller was told to put his hands behind\r\nhis back, and push his little fingers as far in as he could.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSCLES Of LEG.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIAMESE LINK.]\r\n\r\nThis he did, when the treacherous friend made a clean sweep of all the\r\nrings, brooches, ear-rings, and such jewellery as was within his reach,\r\nwhile the unfortunate jeweller was vainly tugging at the Link. This only\r\noccupied a few seconds for a practised hand, and the thief quietly\r\nopened the door, shut it, and was lost in the passing crowd before the\r\njeweller could recover from his surprise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left of the same illustration is a view of the muscles of the\r\nhuman leg, which, as the reader will see, are curiously like the\r\ndistended cassava press. Although the mode of applying the force\r\ndiffers, the principle is the same.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case an external force is applied to the press, but in the\r\nlatter an internal, or rather a central, force is applied to the bones.\r\nIt is evident that if a similar process were carried on with the cassava\r\npress, and the central portion forcibly distended, the supports at\r\neither end would be drawn powerfully towards each other. Substitute the\r\nmuscle for the press, and the bones for the poles, and this is muscular\r\naction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHERE we have a diagram which speaks for itself, as far as muscular\r\naction is concerned, but there is another point to which we shall\r\npresently pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUMAN ARM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEELYARD.]\r\n\r\nThe muscle of the arm is seen running along the bone, passing over the\r\nelbow, where it is held down by a tendinous band, and, by its\r\ncontraction, enabling the arm to be bent so as to uphold a considerable\r\nweight. The mechanical analogy between this arrangement and the common\r\nSteelyard is too evident to need any explanation except inspection of\r\nthe diagram.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is, however, another point which is worthy of consideration. The\r\nmuscle does not proceed at once from the shoulder to the wrist, but\r\npasses under the tendinous band above mentioned, and so produces a\r\nchange of direction when the arm is bent.\r\n\r\nThere is a more complicated arrangement of a similar character in the\r\nhuman hand, a diagram of which is given in the left-hand figure of the\r\naccompanying illustration.\r\n\r\nThe fingers are, of course, moved by a set of tendons, and the muscles,\r\nfrom which these tendons spring, are attached to the fore-arm (I\r\npurposely omit the scientific titles, though they would be much easier\r\nto write). Any of my readers can prove this for themselves.\r\n\r\nLet him first grasp the upper arm firmly, and bend the limbs, and he\r\nwill at once find that the swelling of the muscle shows the source of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThen let him do the same, but grasp the fore-arm, and he will find that\r\nthe muscles are quiescent, showing that the former set of muscles belong\r\nto the entire arm, and not to the fingers, while the muscles of the\r\nlower arm have nothing to do with the bending of that limb.\r\n\r\nNow let him grasp the fore-arm, and open and close the fingers, and he\r\nwill feel a whole set of muscles rise, and swell and harden under his\r\ngrasp. Next let him bend his hand inwards, and he will find that the\r\nfingers work perfectly well, though the direction of force is changed.\r\n\r\nThis is owing to a band of tendons passing across the wrist, under which\r\nthe finger-tendons play. The course of the tendons is marked in the\r\nillustration by leaving them white.\r\n\r\nThe wondrous structure of the human hand and its multitudinous tendons\r\ncan only be appreciated by actual dissection, but an idea of their\r\nvariety and use may be obtained by watching the hands of a skilful\r\npianoforte-player. This struck me forcibly the first time that I ever\r\nheard Thalberg play.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of tendons, I may mention a curious case. A\r\njourneyman carpenter missed a blow with his axe, and struck his left\r\nhand at the junction of the thumb and wrist. The important tendon was\r\nsevered, and the inner muscles, having no counteracting force, dragged\r\nthe thumb into the hollow of the hand.\r\n\r\nTo all appearance, the man could no longer earn a living as a carpenter.\r\nBut he would not be discouraged, and while he was in hospital he\r\nborrowed a book, and studied the anatomy of the human hand. By means of\r\nthis knowledge he constructed a sort of semi-glove, in which he\r\nintroduced pieces of watch-spring, that supplied the place of the lost\r\ntendon.\r\n\r\nNot content with this, he studied Euclid for the purposes of his trade,\r\nso as to get the most possible out of a piece of wood of given\r\ndimensions, and be able to go straight to his mark by a problem, instead\r\nof doing it slowly and clumsily with a two-foot rule and a pair of\r\ncompasses. When I saw him last he was a master carpenter in a large and\r\nincreasing business.\r\n\r\nMan has unconsciously imitated Nature in the invention of the Pulley,\r\nwhereby the direction of force may be altered almost at will. In this\r\ncase the cord takes the part of the working tendon, and the Pulley of\r\nthe fixed tendinous crossbar. There is much matter of interest in the\r\ntendons, but, as our space is fast waning, I must resist the temptation\r\nof describing them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN all machinery one of the chief objects of the machinist is to reduce\r\nfriction as much as possible. He makes all the joints as smooth as tools\r\ncan polish, and always introduces oil or some lubricating substance into\r\nthe joints. Otherwise the engine rattles with a noise proportionate to\r\nits power, and wastes its force on the friction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TENDONS OF HAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PULLEY.]\r\n\r\nIn my childish days a steam-engine of any kind used to rattle so loudly\r\nthat conversation was almost impossible. Now they are made with such\r\nperfection, that the vast engines in use at the pumping stations of the\r\nmetropolitan drainage are almost absolutely silent.\r\n\r\nThere is the enormous hall, filled with gigantic beams and rods, and\r\ncranks, and wheels. A single man turns a little handle, and the whole\r\nmachinery starts into life. Beams rock, cranks and wheels revolve, rods\r\nslide up and down, and all in a silence which is nearly appalling in its\r\nmanifestation of unassuming strength. Indeed, many a hand sewing\r\nmachine makes far more noise than one of those giant engines, and all\r\nbecause in the latter friction is avoided as far as possible, every\r\nscrew is well braced up, and every joint is kept well lubricated.\r\n\r\nHere I may observe that few sewing machines get fair play. They rattle,\r\nthey squeak, they become stiffer daily, they snap the thread, and then\r\ndecline work altogether. And in almost every case this is done by\r\nneglect on the part of the owner, who does not lubricate every point of\r\nthe machine which works upon another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUBRICATION OF JOINT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OILING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nLadies especially are very careless in this respect, and will mostly\r\nomit three or four of the oiling points. They might just as well omit\r\nthem all, as a single unoiled point will disarrange the harmonious\r\nmotion of the whole machine. I have often been called in as surgeon in\r\nsuch cases, and have almost invariably been able to point to several\r\nspots which needed oil, and did not get it. Sometimes, out of false\r\neconomy, an inferior oil is used, which speedily clogs and hardens, and\r\nstops all movement. In such a case the best remedy is to apply paraffine\r\nliberally, and use it for a quarter of an hour or so. It will soon\r\ndissolve the clogged oil, which may be worked out by turning the handle\r\nor crank of the machine.\r\n\r\nOf course the best remedy is to take the machine to pieces, polish the\r\njoints, lubricate them, and put it together again. But this is a\r\nperilous process, and an amateur, if he tries it, will generally find\r\nhimself with half-a-dozen pieces for which he can find no place.\r\nParaffine will answer every purpose, and I have released many a\r\nstiffened machine by its use.\r\n\r\nThen some people leave their machines untouched for days, or even weeks,\r\nand then wonder that they work stiffly. Every day the machine should he\r\nworked, if only for a few seconds, and then it will seldom stiffen. It\r\nis just the same with steamers. When they are in harbour, though the\r\nfires be out, and they are not meant to move for weeks, the engines are\r\nalways turned round at least once daily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBOTH these rules hold good in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nTo every joint there are attached certain glands that supply a kind of\r\noily substance technically named “synovia,” which acts exactly the same\r\npart as the oil or grease of machinery. If these glands do not do their\r\nduty, and the supply of synovia be defective, the joints become stiff,\r\npainful, and crackle when they are moved.\r\n\r\nThen, exactly as the joints of a machine become stiff from non-usage, so\r\ndo those of a human being. We will take, for example, the Indian Fakirs\r\nwho vow that they will not move some limb from a definite posture. At\r\nfirst the exertion is trying and painful, but by degrees the disused\r\njoints lose their faculty of motion, and, even if their owner wished to\r\nmove a limb, he could not do it.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand figure of the illustration represents the lubrication of\r\nan ordinary sewing machine, and the left-hand figure is a section of the\r\nhuman knee-joint, showing the gland which supplies the synovia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPERHAPS some of my readers may think that such a subject as the\r\n“Lazy-tongs” is too trivial for a work which deals, however lightly,\r\nwith science. But there may be some who know the inestimable benefit of\r\nLazy-tongs under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases where a severe injury has occurred, or where\r\nrheumatism has fixed its tiger-claws in the joints, so that movement is\r\nall but impossible. There may be no one in the room to help the invalid,\r\nand even to stretch the arm over the table is as impossible as to jump\r\nover the house.\r\n\r\nThen it is that the real value of the Lazy-tongs becomes manifested, and\r\nthat it shows itself in the light of a supplementary limb. With a mere\r\nmovement of the fingers it can be stretched across any table which is\r\nlikely to be placed before an invalid, and seize the required object by\r\nthe tongs at the further end.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback to its use is, that the instrument cannot be shortened\r\nwithout opening the tongs. But, if some plan could be devised whereby\r\nthe tongs could retain their hold under those conditions, the instrument\r\nwould be a perfect one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXACTLY such a Lazy-tongs we have in Nature, in the well-known “mask of\r\nthe larva and pupa of the Dragon-fly.” It is called a mask because, when\r\nclosed, it covers the face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD AND PROBOSCIS OF HOUSE-FLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASK OF DRAGON-FLY LARVA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAZY-TONGS.]\r\n\r\nIt chiefly consists of two flat, horny plates, hinged in each other like\r\na carpenter’s two-foot rule, and being capable of extension to a\r\nconsiderable length. The end is widened, and furnished with two jaws,\r\nwhich take the part of the tongs in the instrument above described.\r\n\r\nThis curious apparatus is used for the purpose of securing prey.\r\n\r\nI have kept many of these creatures, and watched their mode of feeding.\r\nAs has already been mentioned, they have two modes of progression,\r\n_i.e._ walking by means of legs like those of ordinary insects; and\r\ndriving themselves along by ejecting water from the tail, on the\r\nprinciple of the rocket. As far as I have seen, the latter mode is\r\nalways used in taking prey. The Dragon-fly larva always lives at the\r\nbottom of the water, though it can force itself to the surface if\r\nneedful. And, like the dreaded ground-shark, it seizes its prey from\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nIts favourite food is the larva of the whirlwig-beetle, a fat white\r\ngrub, with a number of white, soft, feathery gills fringing its sides.\r\nIn order to produce a current of air over these gills, the larva\r\nwriggles itself up to a height of several inches, and then sinks slowly\r\ndown, with the white gills floating on either side.\r\n\r\nShould a Dragon-fly larva be near, it sees the grub ascending, glides\r\nquietly under it without using its legs so as to cause alarm, waits for\r\nit to sink, darts out the mask, seizes it in the jaws, drags it to its\r\nmouth, and the grub is seen no more. So voracious are these larvæ, that,\r\nif only two are kept in the same vessel, one is sure to devour the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER good example of the Lazy-tongs is the Proboscis of the common\r\nHouse-fly. We have all seen these insects alight near sugar, or any\r\nother tempting food, unfold the proboscis, pour a drop of liquid in the\r\nsugar, dissolve it, suck it up, and then shut up the proboscis as if by\r\nhinges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER labour-saving machine is the Apple-parer, a comparatively modern\r\ninvention. The principle is, that a knife is pressed lightly by a spring\r\nagainst a revolving apple, and set at such an angle that nothing but the\r\noutside peel can be removed. Where large numbers of apples have to be\r\npared, as in making preserves or in hotels, this is a most useful\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SQUIRREL AND NUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLE PARER.]\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw it at work, the operation seemed familiar to me, but I\r\ncould not at first remember the parallel. At last it flashed across me\r\nthat a Squirrel eating a nut was the natural parallel of the Paring\r\nMachine.\r\n\r\nAfter splitting the shell and extracting the kernel, the Squirrel takes\r\nthe latter between its fore-paws, presses it against its upper incisor\r\nteeth, and makes it revolve rapidly. In a second or two the kernel is\r\nperfectly peeled, and is then eaten.\r\n\r\nIn this case the incisor teeth of the Squirrel take the part of the\r\nknife, the muscles of the leg that of the spring, and the sharp edges of\r\nthe upper teeth that of the knife. The structure of the Rodent teeth has\r\nalready been explained in page 233.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE wonderful effects of water in breaking up the hardest rock have\r\nalready been described. We will now proceed to another branch of the\r\nsame subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROST-CLEFT ROCK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONE-SPLITTING.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers may have wandered along our rocky coasts, and\r\nhave seen how large masses of rock are continually detaching themselves,\r\nthough they are so hard that a cold chisel is needed to make any\r\nimpression upon them.\r\n\r\nThen they fall into the sea, and are rolled backwards and forwards until\r\nthey become smoothed and rounded, and are called pebbles, while the\r\nportion that is rubbed off them is called sand. The phenomenon is well\r\nshown in the wonderful Pebble Ridge of North Devon.\r\n\r\nThe real agent is ice.\r\n\r\nWe all know that, when water freezes, it expands considerably. This\r\naccounts for two phenomena.\r\n\r\nFirst, as it expands, it becomes lighter than water, and consequently\r\nfloats on the surface.\r\n\r\nNext, there are few of us who have not seen water-bottles cracked by\r\nthe freezing of the water. The most common, and perhaps the most\r\nunpleasant, example of this propensity is the bursting of water-pipes in\r\nthe winter, followed by a flooding of the house when the thaw comes.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the expansion of the frozen water, which will burst\r\nnot only a thin leaden tube, but a stout iron vessel. Care should\r\ntherefore be taken, at the beginning of winter, to cover up all exposed\r\nportions of leaden pipes, and there will then be no danger. There was\r\none pipe in my house that was always bursting, but after I covered it\r\nwith two or three layers of carpet placed loosely over each other, so as\r\nto entangle the air and form a non-conductor, the pipe has never frozen,\r\nand the water supply has been uninterrupted by the severest frosts.\r\n\r\nI am told that a still better plan exists, especially in places where\r\nthe pipes cannot be thoroughly protected by external wrappings. Let six\r\ninches or so of the leaden pipe be removed, and its place supplied by a\r\nvulcanised india-rubber tube.\r\n\r\nThe ice _must_ expand somewhere, and chooses the spot where least\r\nresistance is offered to it. Consequently, it expands in the\r\nindia-rubber tube, but does not break it, and, when the thaw comes,\r\nthere is no overflow of water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMAN utilises this power of ice in stone-splitting. Instead of taking the\r\ntrouble to cut the stone by manual labour, the workmen bore a series of\r\nholes, fill them with water, insert tightly a wooden plug to prevent the\r\nice, when formed, from oozing out of the holes, and leave the rest for\r\nthe frost to do.\r\n\r\nA like effect is produced in the warm weather by substituting similar\r\nplugs, but quite dry, having been baked for hours in an oven, for the\r\npurpose of driving out every particle of moisture. These plugs are\r\nhammered into the holes as deeply as they will go, and there left. Even\r\nif there be no rain, the nightly dews make their way into the pores of\r\nthe dry wood, and cause it to swell with such irresistible force that\r\nthe stone is split with scarcely any manual labour on the part of the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYET another plan for cutting hard stones. Some of my readers may be\r\naware that a singularly ingenious instrument has been invented for\r\ncutting boles in granite and other hard rocks. It is called the Diamond\r\nDrill, because its tip is armed with uncut diamonds.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the diamond should not be cut, as the natural edges\r\nare needed. A glazier’s diamond, for example, is always set as it came\r\nout of the mine. The stories that are told about cutting out panes of\r\nglass with a diamond ring are all absurd. A diamond, when it has once\r\npassed through the hands of the jeweller, cannot cut glass. It can\r\nscratch glass, but not one whit better than a flake of ordinary flint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORER OF ŒSTRUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAMOND-HEADED BORER.]\r\n\r\nIt is found that the Diamond Drill works with wondrous rapidity, cutting\r\naway the stone with ease, and suffering scarcely any damage itself. The\r\ntube to the end of which the diamonds are fixed is generally made in\r\ntelescopic fashion, so as to allow it to penetrate deeply into the rock,\r\nwithout the necessity of shifting the machine by which it is turned. I\r\nneed hardly say that its rate of speed is very great indeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR old friend, the Gad-fly, again affords an example of a parallel.\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor is tubular, telescopic, and furnished at the top with\r\nfive little hard, sharp, scaly knobs, which act the same part as the\r\ndiamonds of the mining tool. Even the scoop-like shape of the tip, and\r\nthe telescopic shaft, are almost identical in both instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTELESCOPIC TUBES.--DIRECT ACTION.--DISTRIBUTION OF\r\nWEIGHT.--TREE-CLIMBING.--THE WHEEL.\r\n\r\n     Telescopic Tubes, their Structure and Uses.--The Japanese\r\n     Fishing-rod.--The Tripod Wheel-bearer and its Telescopic\r\n     Structure.--The Rat-tailed Maggot.--Locomotion.--Direct\r\n     Action.--The Rocket, the Water Tourniquet, and Electric\r\n     Tourniquet.--Cuttle-fish.--The Flying Squids.--The Paper\r\n     Nautilus.--Proceedings of newly-hatched Calamaries.--Larva of the\r\n     Dragonfly.--Distribution of Weight.--The Snow-shoe, its Structure\r\n     and Mode of using it.--The Skidor of Norway.--A formidable Rifle\r\n     Corps.--The Mud-patten.--Foot of Duck tribe.--Foot of\r\n     Jacana.--Locomotion of Water-gnat.--Tree-climbing.--Mode of\r\n     ascending Palm-trees.--The Value of a Hoop.--The “Girt Pupa” and\r\n     Butterfly.--Principle of the Wheel.--The primitive Wooden\r\n     Wheel.--Spoked Wheels.--Driving Wheel of the Bicycle.--Naturally\r\n     spoked Wheel of the Chirodota.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS AND APPLIANCES (_continued_).\r\n\r\nWe will now treat rather more in detail the two subjects which were\r\nlightly touched upon at the end of the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that the diamond-headed borer is made in\r\ntelescope form, so as to be adjustable at pleasure. It was also remarked\r\nthat the ovipositor of the Gad-fly was made in a similar fashion, so as\r\nto be withdrawn within the body of the insect when not needed, and\r\nprotrusible to a considerable extent when the Gad-fly wishes to deposit\r\nher eggs.\r\n\r\nAs to our modern telescopes and opera-glasses, they are so familiar that\r\nthere is little use in describing them, except to say that their\r\nframework consists of a number of tubes of gradually lessening diameter,\r\nthe one sliding within the other, so that the instrument can be\r\nlengthened or shortened at will, so as to suit the focus of the\r\nobserving eye.\r\n\r\nA very ingenious adaptation of the telescopic principle is seen in the\r\nJapanese fishing-rod, which is now tolerably well known. Our own\r\ntelescopic rods require to be withdrawn at the butt-end, and then fitted\r\ntogether in front. But the Japanese rods are so made that, after taking\r\noff the ferrule of the seeming walking-stick, a mere fling of the hand\r\nwill send joint after joint flying out, and fixing themselves in regular\r\nsuccession. So admirably are these rods made, that even blowing into the\r\nbutt-end will have the same effect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nONE of the most perfect, if not the most perfect, example of the\r\ntelescopic tube is to be found in the Tripod Wheel-bearer (_Actinurus_),\r\none of the numerous aquatic Rotifers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACTINURUS TAIL, OPEN AND CLOSED (MAGNIFIED).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nIt is not usually so small as the generality of its class, being nearly\r\none-twentieth of an inch in length, and visible to the unassisted eye,\r\nprovided that the owner of the eye in question knows how to use it.\r\n\r\nWhen placed under a microscope of moderate power, the Actinurus is seen\r\nto be built almost wholly upon the telescopic pattern. Only the centre\r\nof the body remains stationary, the two ends being framed on the\r\nprinciple of the telescopic tube, and capable of being enclosed within\r\nthe central portion, just as is the case with the Japanese fishing-rod.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration the Actinurus is shown in two attitudes. In the\r\nupper figure it is represented as having the fore-part of the body\r\nentirely, and the tail part nearly, withdrawn within the central\r\nportion. The lower figure shows the same specimen with all its\r\ntelescopic tubes drawn out to full length.\r\n\r\nThe creature is perpetually elongating and contracting its body by means\r\nof these tubes, so that a measurement of its length is not easy to\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\nA full and interesting description of this curious Rotifer may be found\r\nin Gosse’s “Evenings at the Microscope,” p. 300. The long tails of the\r\nRat-tailed Maggot, already described under the head of Diving, are good\r\nexamples of the drawtube as found in Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCOMOTION.--DIRECT ACTION.\r\n\r\nThe second point which has to be elucidated is that or progress by means\r\nof Direct Action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNAUTILUS.\r\n\r\nLARVA OF DRAGON-FLY.\r\n\r\nROCKET.\r\n\r\nWATER TOURNIQUET.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC TOURNIQUET.]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how vessels can be propelled by sail, oar, paddle,\r\nor screw. We have now to consider a mode of progress which requires none\r\nof these things, but which works by means of Direct Action.\r\n\r\nSuch, for example, is the progress of a Rocket through the air.\r\n\r\nThe heated gases rush out with tremendous violence, and, by their\r\npressure, urge the heavy rocket into the air with the rush, roar, and\r\nbang so familiar to all who have witnessed a good display of fireworks.\r\n\r\nA rocket in the act of ascent is shown in the uppermost figure of the\r\naccompanying illustration.\r\n\r\nBelow it is shown the Water Turbine, the principle of which is evident\r\nfrom the sketch.\r\n\r\nFrom each of the apertures a stream of water is forcibly directed, and,\r\nby its resistance, spins the vessel round and round. There are several\r\nshops in London in which this instrument may be seen at work.\r\n\r\nAlthough in such positions it is necessarily a mere toy, it carries with\r\nit, in common with many other toys, the germs of valuable inventions.\r\nIndeed, there have been attempts to utilise the principle of Direct\r\nAction in the propulsion of vessels, but as yet the mechanical\r\ndifficulties have proved practically insuperable, and, although a vessel\r\nhas been thus propelled, the expense has been heavier than that of the\r\npaddle or screw, and the speed not nearly so great.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration is another example of Direct\r\nAction, called the Electric Tourniquet.\r\n\r\nIn the two previously mentioned instruments the motive power is visible,\r\nbut in this it is invisible except in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe principle is exactly the same as in the pocket or water tourniquet;\r\nbut, instead of heated air or a stream of water, electricity is used.\r\nThe instrument is attached to an electric machine, and fully charged.\r\nThe electric fluid rushes out of the points, forces itself against the\r\nair, and so, by its recoil, drives the machine round and round upon its\r\npivot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE will now take two examples of Direct Action as found in Nature.\r\n\r\nPerhaps many of my readers have seen the Octopus, and admired the manner\r\nin which it glides through the water, trailing its long arms behind it.\r\nWhence the force comes is not easily seen, and the creature appears to\r\nmove almost by volition. In reality, however, it employs Direct Action.\r\nIt takes water into the body, and then it ejects it through a tube\r\ncalled the “siphon” with such force that the animal is propelled\r\nbackwards through the water.\r\n\r\nSome of the creatures belonging to the Cuttles, and popularly called\r\nSquids, can use such extraordinary powers that they can project\r\nthemselves far out of the water. In consequence of this power, they are\r\nsometimes called Flying Squids, and, as they have been known to shoot\r\nthemselves completely over the hull of a large ship, they well deserve\r\nthe name.\r\n\r\nThe common Squid of our coasts, which furnishes the so-called\r\nCuttle-bone, affords us a good example of Direct Action. I once hatched\r\na number of young Squids from the grape-like eggs, and it was most\r\ncurious to see how the little creatures shot about as soon as they\r\nescaped from the egg.\r\n\r\nThey also utilised the siphon in another way. Poising themselves just\r\nabove the sand with which the bottom of the vessel was covered, they\r\ndirected a stream of water upon it, and thus formed little cavities into\r\nwhich they settled like birds into their nests.\r\n\r\nThe figure represents the Paper Nautilus as it appears while passing\r\nthrough the water. Just at the base of the tentacles is seen the short\r\nsiphon, from which it is pouring the stream of water which drives it\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nBelow the Nautilus is seen the larva of the common Dragonfly. We have,\r\nwhen treating of the Lazy-tongs, already described the mode in which the\r\ninsect takes its prey, and our object could not be served by repetition.\r\nSuffice it to say that the insect is shown in the act of ejecting water,\r\nand so shooting itself along in preparation for seizing prey.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF WEIGHT.\r\n\r\nBeing on the subject of locomotion, we will examine a few of the\r\ncontrivances by which a man is enabled to pass in safety over soft\r\nsubstances into which he would otherwise sink.\r\n\r\nThe first and best-known of these is the Snow-shoe of Northern America.\r\nIt is a framework of wood, shaped as shown in the upper figure on the\r\nright-hand side, and strengthened by two cross-bars. The interior of the\r\n“shoe” is filled in with hide thongs arranged much like those of a\r\nracket, and stretched as tightly. The front of the snow-shoe is slightly\r\nturned up, so as to avoid the danger of the point sticking in the snow,\r\nan event which, however, generally happens to a novice.\r\n\r\nThese instruments are of considerable size, a specimen in my collection\r\nmeasuring exactly five feet in length, by fifteen inches in width.\r\n\r\nSupported on the snow-shoe, the hunter is enabled to glide unhurt over\r\nthe deep snow in which he must have sunk without some such aid. He can\r\nthus hunt the bison, the wapiti, or any of the larger animals, being\r\nable to pass rapidly over the surface, while they are laboriously\r\nploughing their way through the snow-drifts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFEET OF DUCKS.          SNOW-SHOE.\r\nFOOT OF JACANA.         MUD-PATTEN.\r\nWATER-GNAT.             SKIDOR.]\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that the snow falls before the shoes are ready.\r\nIn this case the hunter is obliged to extemporise snow-shoes by cutting\r\nthem out of thin boards.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, when snow fell heavily and remained unmelted for many\r\ndays, some Canadians, who were visiting England, made quite a sensation\r\nby donning their snow-shoes, and travelling over the snow-clad country.\r\nIt was very pretty to see the easy way in which they could shoot down a\r\nhill, and to watch the peculiar gait which is needed by the snow-shoe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAT the bottom of the illustration is shown a portion of a curious skate\r\nused in Norway, and called Skidor.\r\n\r\nThese remarkable implements achieve by means of length the task which\r\nthe snow-shoe accomplishes by width. They are made of wood, and, though\r\nbut a few inches in width, are ten feet or more in length. One is always\r\na few feet shorter than the other, for the convenience of turning. Much\r\npractice is needed for the management of the Skidors, but, when they are\r\nfairly mastered, they enable their owner to travel at a wonderful pace.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian hunter is quite as dependent on his Skidor as the North\r\nAmerican on his Snow-shoe, and uses it for exactly the same purpose. A\r\ncorps of these hunters has been organized for war, and very formidable\r\nthey were, hanging on the skirts of the enemy, and giving him no rest,\r\nday or night. They never came within fifty yards of each other, so that\r\neven cannon were useless; and, as soon as they thought that they were\r\nendangered, they dispersed in all directions, only to reunite and swoop\r\ndown again on the enemy at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE central figure represents the Mud-patten, which, as its name\r\nimplies, plays the same part towards mud that the snow-shoe and skidor\r\ndo to the snow. Like them, also, it is not easy to manage; and a novice\r\nis tolerably certain to drive the front of the patten into the mud, and\r\nso get an awkward and not aromatic fall.\r\n\r\nThis patten, which is merely a square piece of board attached to the\r\nfoot, is in use on many of our coasts where the ebbing tide runs out to\r\na great distance, leaving a vast expanse of soft mud. Like the skidor\r\nand the snow-shoe, it is mostly used by sportsmen, especially in the\r\nwinter, when wild-duck shooting sets in.\r\n\r\nAided by the pattens, a sportsman can travel for miles over mud that\r\nwould otherwise swallow him up, shoot his birds, and secure them when\r\nfallen. While engaged in winter shooting on the Medway, we have often\r\nlost birds because they fell beyond a deep mud-bank, and we had no means\r\nof crossing it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration are some natural parallels of\r\nthese artificial aids. The two upper figures represent two forms of\r\nwebbed feet, and the analogy between them and the snow-shoe and\r\nmud-patten is too obvious to need explanation.\r\n\r\nIn the centre is the foot of the Jacana, an Asiatic bird. Its foot may\r\nwell be taken as the analogue of the skidor, length taking the place of\r\nbreadth, and enabling the weight to be distributed over a large surface.\r\n\r\nThis bird finds its food in rivers and lakes, and, by reason of its\r\nenormously long toes, can walk with safety over slight floating\r\nvegetation, which would give way at once under the tread of any bird\r\nexcept a Jacana. Very good representations of this bird are to be seen\r\nin Japanese works of art, especially those which are mounted as screens.\r\nEven the peculiar gait of the bird is given with marvellous truth.\r\n\r\nThe last figure represents the common Water-gnat (_Gerris_), which may\r\nbe seen in almost any piece of fresh water, however small. Ponds that\r\nare open to the south, and sheltered from the north wind, are its\r\nfavourite localities.\r\n\r\nIt is a carnivorous being, feeding almost wholly on insects that fall\r\ninto the water. In order to capture them, it runs rapidly over the\r\nsurface of the water, the long slender legs distributing its weight over\r\na large surface, and so keeping it from sinking. Only the last two pairs\r\nof legs are employed for this purpose, the first pair being held in\r\nfront of the body, and used for the purpose of capturing prey.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE-CLIMBING.\r\n\r\nAnother curious aid to locomotion is shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world, where the cocoa-nut palm grows, the natives\r\nhave invented a simple, but ingenious, plan for ascending the tall,\r\ncurved stem. Such a thing as an upright palm-tree is unknown, and\r\nconsequently the ascent of the branchless stem is not an easy task\r\nwithout artificial assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen I treated of Warfare and the different modes of scaling walls, the\r\nclimbing-spur was casually mentioned. The implement of the palm-climber,\r\nhowever, is simpler and more effective, as it leaves both hands at\r\nliberty when desired.\r\n\r\nThe man cuts a long piece of one of the tough and almost unbreakable\r\ncreepers which festoon the trees of tropical climes. He passes it round\r\nthe trunk which he wishes to climb, and fastens the ends firmly\r\ntogether, so as to form a large loose hoop. He then passes the hoop over\r\nhis head, until it presses against his back, as seen in the\r\nillustration, and serves to support him as he leans against it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIRT PUPA AND BUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLIMBING PALM-TREE.]\r\n\r\nTaking the hoop by the two sides, he lifts it up the trunk as far as he\r\ncan, places the soles of his feet against the tree, and so walks up it,\r\nhitching the hoop upwards at every step. When he has reached the top of\r\nthe tree, he supports himself entirely by the hoop, while his hands are\r\nat liberty to be used in getting the cocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the insect world there are many examples of support being given by a\r\nbelt passing round the body.\r\n\r\nAmong the Butterflies, for example, there are many which, in their pupal\r\nstage of existence, are attached to upright stems. They are fixed to the\r\nstem by a few threads at the tail, answering to the feet of the\r\ntree-climber, while the body is kept in position by a stout silken\r\nthread passed loosely round it.\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents the pupa of the common Swallow-tailed\r\nButterfly, while in the centre is the same insect in the perfect state\r\nas it appears when resting. It really seems as if the ancient habit of\r\nthe pupa had been remembered by the perfect insect, the long ends of the\r\nhinder wings taking the place of the pupal tail, and the legs that of\r\nthe belt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHEEL.\r\n\r\nYet another aid to locomotion is found in the WHEEL, a contrivance for\r\ndiminishing friction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEEL-SPICULE OF CHIBODOTA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CART-WHEEL.]\r\n\r\nWhen man first learnt that heavier weights could be dragged than\r\ncarried, he simply placed them on flat boards to which ropes were\r\nattached. The next step was necessarily the invention of the sledge, the\r\nburden resting on two parallel runners, the ends of which were slightly\r\ncurved so as to prevent them from hitching against any small\r\nobstruction. In some countries--such, for example, as in\r\nEsquimaux-land--the sledge is the only vehicle practicable, and even\r\nEuropeans, when they visit that country, are fain to adopt the sledge if\r\nthey would live.\r\n\r\nBut, in more temperate zones, the Wheel is paramount. In its earlier\r\nstages the wheel was a very simple business. It was simply a section of,\r\na tree-trunk, dubbed roughly round, and with a hole in the centre,\r\nthrough which the axle passed. Such wheels are still in existence in\r\nmany parts of Europe; and, owing to the want of regularity of outline in\r\nthe circumference, and the utter absence of grease, the wheels keep up a\r\ncontinuous shriek, almost deafening to those who are unused to it, but\r\nperfectly unheeded by those who own or drive the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe next improvement was to make the circumference of the wheel as\r\nperfectly circular as the art of man could devise, and, instead of\r\nhaving the wheel solid, to fill up its interior with spokes, thus\r\ngaining lightness and strength at the same time.\r\n\r\nOf all locomotive wheels, I suppose that the modern Bicycle affords the\r\nbest example. The driving wheel is larger than the hind wheel of an\r\nordinary coach, and yet the spokes are not nearly so thick as the\r\nporcupine quill with which this account is written.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the ancient sculptures and paintings of Egypt and Assyria,\r\nas preserved in the British Museum, we shall see that either kind of\r\nwheel was used according to the work which it had to do. The solid,\r\nuneven, squeaking, wooden wheel was devoted to agriculture, while the\r\nlight, spoked wheel was sacred either to warfare or hunting.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that in the two latter cases some modicum of grease might\r\nhave been used, as the outcries of tortured and unlubricated machinery\r\nare enough to drive away all wild beasts which come within the range of\r\nits complaints, while the nervous system of hunter or warrior must have\r\nbeen seriously damaged by it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVEN in such a structure as the spoked Wheel, Nature has anticipated\r\nMan.\r\n\r\nMy readers may remember that, when treating of nautical matters, I\r\nmentioned the singular anchor-shaped spicules that are found upon one of\r\nthe sea-slugs, called Synapta.\r\n\r\nThere is another group of these creatures inhabiting the Mediterranean,\r\nin which the skin-spicules take a different form. Like those of the\r\nSynapta, they are too small and translucent to be seen without the aid\r\nof the microscope and carefully adjusted light. But, just as the\r\nspicules of the Synapta resemble the ancient anchor, so do those of the\r\nChirodota resemble the ancient wheel, the similitude being in both cases\r\nabsolutely startling.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but, as all readers must be aware, if they have studied\r\npractical mechanics, there are many machines which are toothed on the\r\ninner, and not the outer, side of the circumference. Here, in the\r\nChirodota, the inner toothing is manifest.\r\n\r\nWhat purpose it serves we know not. The Chirodota’s wheels (of which\r\nthere are thousands) never revolve, neither do the anchors of the\r\nSynapta hold the ground. Yet the very fact that such exceedingly minute\r\nobjects should be so carefully constructed tells us at once that they\r\nmust have some important purpose to serve, though at present that\r\npurpose is a mystery which no one has attempted to solve.\r\n\r\nI have little doubt that when the hour and the man arrive, as arrive\r\nthey surely will, we shall find in these tiny and almost unrecognised\r\nspicules the keys to treasures of wisdom which at present have been\r\nopened to no human being.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of the progress of the human race shows that facts\r\nhave been allowed to accumulate, fought about, and turned in all\r\ndirections, before the generaliser comes who pierces to the heart of\r\neverything, reduces apparent discrepancies to harmony, and usually is\r\nrewarded by finding some one else assume the credit of his discoveries,\r\nand receive all the honours and emoluments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n     Paper and its many Uses.--The Egyptian Papyrus.--India\r\n     Paper.--China and its Manufactories.--Materials of which Paper is\r\n     made.--Annual Consumption of Material.--The “Water Mark.”--Nature’s\r\n     Papers.--Wasps and Hornets.--The common Wasp, and the various\r\n     Materials of its Nest.--Utilisation of\r\n     Material.--Papier-mâché.--Printing.--Nature-printing.--Method and\r\n     Results of the Process.--Use of the Electrotype.--“Facing” the\r\n     Copper Plates with hard Metal.--The Coal Mine and its\r\n     Nature-printing.--Stippling, its Use and Abuse.--The Line and the\r\n     Dot.--Modification of the Dot.--Flower-petals.--The\r\n     Pelargonium.--Plaster Castings.--Stereotyping and\r\n     Electrotyping.--Modern Method of taking Plaster Casts.--The\r\n     Principle of Corrugation.--Flower-pot Covers.--Iron Buildings.--The\r\n     Polistes and its Corrugated Dwellings.\r\n\r\n\r\nART.\r\n\r\nWe will now touch lightly on the subject of Art.\r\n\r\nIn the present day one of the most indispensable accessories to art is\r\nPaper.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that we have no records as to the time when paper\r\nwas first invented. The Egyptian papyrus we do not consider, as it was\r\nnot paper in our sense of the word, although we have retained the name.\r\n\r\nPaper is a vegetable fibre carefully disintegrated, made into a pulp\r\nwith water, and then dried in thin sheets. As is the case with many\r\narts, China seems to have taken the lead in paper manufacture, and we\r\nare even now indebted to that country for the “India Paper” on which the\r\nfinest proofs of engravings are taken. This paper is made from the inner\r\nbark of the bamboo. “Rice Paper,” so called, is not paper at all, but\r\nonly a kind of pith cut spirally, and flattened by pressure.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any vegetable fibre of which paper cannot be made, and\r\nvarious plants have been suggested for this purpose, such as the\r\nstinging-nettle, cabbage-stalks, hop-bines, the waste of sugar-cane,\r\nsawdust, &c. Straw has already been successfully used, and so has\r\nEsparto grass.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when there was a scarcity of material for paper-making,\r\nthe well-known Grass-wrack of our shores (_Zostera marina_) was brought\r\ninto partial use. I believe, however, that the experiment was not a\r\nsuccessful one. The Chinese make their paper of bamboo, macerating and\r\npounding it until it is reduced to a pulp, and then shaken into fibres\r\nin a mould.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNEST OF HORNET.         PAPER-MAKING.\r\nNEST OF TREE-WASP.      PAPER.]\r\n\r\nWith us, white paper, such as is used by the writer, printer, or artist,\r\nis made almost exclusively of cotton or linen rags. Upwards of a hundred\r\nand twenty thousand tons weight of rags are annually consumed in this\r\ncountry for the manufacture of paper. After being bleached, they are\r\ntorn and ground into a pulp, which is then handed over to the actual\r\nmaker.\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents paper-making by hand, a process which is now\r\nrarely used, except for special kinds of paper. Omitting technical\r\ndetails, the mode of paper-making by hand is as follows:--The pulp being\r\nprepared, the workman takes a “mould,” _i.e._ a frame with a bottom of\r\nclosely woven wire. Having put into the mould a sufficient quantity of\r\npulp, he shakes the mould so as to spread the pulp evenly over the\r\nsurface. The water runs away between the wires, the sheet of pulp is\r\ntransferred to a piece of felt, and when it is dry it becomes paper. If\r\na sheet of ordinary note-paper be held up to the light, the marks of the\r\nwires are plainly perceptible. The so-called “water-mark” is due to\r\nwires twisted into the requisite shape.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese workman makes his paper exactly on the same principle, but\r\nthe bottom of his mould is made of bulrushes instead of wires.\r\n\r\nAs for machine-made paper, the process seems absolutely magical. Endless\r\nbands of felt and wire are substituted for the hand frames, and, the\r\npulp being poured in at one end, the finished paper is poured out at the\r\nother, and self-wound on rollers. Without any exaggeration, paper is now\r\nmade by the mile, the only limit to its length being the size of the\r\nrolls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHEN I mention Paper-making in the world of Nature, many of my readers\r\nwill at once know that I am about to refer to the Wasp tribe.\r\n\r\nThese insects were paper-makers long before even the Chinese had\r\ninvented the art, and, so exactly similar is the mode of action, that\r\nman might well have copied from the insect.\r\n\r\nThe Wasp gnaws a bundle of vegetable fibres, mostly of wood, sound or\r\ndecaying, according to the species. It masticates them until it has\r\nreduced them to a pulp, and then, by means of its jaws, spreads the pulp\r\ninto sheets of various shapes and sizes.\r\n\r\nWith some of the pulp it forms hexagonal cells like those of the bee,\r\nand with some it makes the roof-like covering which defends the cells.\r\nNot only that, but it can make a sort of papier-mâché, which it uses for\r\nthe flooring, if we may so call it, of the different strata of cells,\r\nand for the pillars which bind them together.\r\n\r\nLike our own paper manufacturers, it is economic of material, will\r\nre-masticate any superabundant paper, and is only too glad if it can get\r\nhold of any paper made by man. I have seen a wasps’ nest which was made\r\nentirely from the empty blue and white cartridges that were thrown away\r\nby soldiers.\r\n\r\nThen there is as much difference in the papers made by wasps as in those\r\nmade by man. In this country all wasps’ nests are made of very fragile\r\nmaterial, but in South America there are some wasps which make the\r\nexternal covering of their nests as hard and white as the stiff\r\ncardboard employed by artists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHAVING now got our paper, we will glance at one or two modes of using it\r\nfor Art. Papier-mâché has already been mentioned, and it is worthy of\r\nnotice that there are now in existence many decorated ceilings which are\r\nmade of this material, on account of its great strength and its\r\nnon-liability to fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FERNS IN COAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATURE-PRINTING.]\r\n\r\nThe first invention which we shall notice is that which is known by the\r\nname of Nature-printing, and which has been so successful in\r\ntransferring to paper an exact representation of vegetable foliage.\r\n\r\nOne simple tolerably efficacious mode of Nature-printing has long been\r\nknown. A piece of paper being rubbed with lamp-black and oil, the leaf\r\nwas laid upon it and gently rubbed, so as to transfer the lamp-black to\r\nthe nervures. It was then laid on a sheet of white paper, and again\r\nrubbed, when an impression of the leaf was left upon the paper.\r\n\r\nThe present system of Nature-printing is far in advance of this rather\r\nrude method, and amounts to an exact reproduction of the plant, not only\r\nin form and detail, but in colour.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate this beautiful process, I cannot do better than\r\ntransfer to these pages the following account of Nature-printing as\r\ngiven in Ure’s “Dictionary of Arts,” &c. It is an abstract of a lecture\r\ndelivered by Mr. H. Bradbury at the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n“Nature-printing is the name given to a technical process for obtaining\r\nprinted reproductions of plants and other objects upon paper, in a\r\nmanner so truthful, that only a close inspection reveals the fact of\r\ntheir being copies; and so distinctly sensible even to touch are the\r\nimpressions, that it is difficult to persuade those unacquainted with\r\nthe manipulation that they are an emanation of the printing-press.\r\n\r\n“The distinguishing feature of the process consists, first, in\r\nimpressing natural objects--such as plants, mosses, seaweeds, and\r\nfeathers--into plates of metal, causing, as it were, the objects to\r\nengrave themselves by pressure; secondly, in being able to take such\r\ncasts or copies of the impressed plates as can be printed from at the\r\nordinary copper-plate press.\r\n\r\n“This secures, in the case of a plant, on the one hand, a perfect\r\nrepresentation of its characteristic outline, of some of the other\r\nexternal marks by which it is known, and even in some measure of its\r\nstructure, as in the venation of ferns and the ribs of the leaves of\r\nflowering plants; and, on the other, affords the means of multiplying\r\ncopies in a quick and easy manner, at a trifling expense compared with\r\nthe result, and to an unlimited extent.\r\n\r\n“The great defect of all pictorial representations of botanical figures\r\nhas consisted in the inability of art to represent faithfully those\r\nminute peculiarities by which natural objects are often best\r\ndistinguished. Nature-printing has therefore come to the aid of this\r\nbranch of science in particular, whilst its future development promises\r\nfacilities for copying other objects of nature, the reproduction of\r\nwhich is not within the province of the human hand to execute; and even\r\nif it were possible, it would involve an amount of labour scarcely\r\ncommensurate with the results.\r\n\r\n“Possessing the advantages of rapid and economic production, the means\r\nof unlimited multiplication, and, above all, unsurpassable resemblance\r\nto the original, nature-printing is calculated to assist much in\r\nfacilitating not only the first-sight recognition of many objects in\r\nnatural history, but in supplying the detailed evidences of\r\nidentification, which must prove of essential value to botanical science\r\nin particular.”\r\n\r\nMany plans have been tried with only partial success, but that which is\r\nnow in operation produces the most wonderful results. The plants are\r\nlaid upon sheets of lead, and then passed through rollers, so as to\r\nleave an impression in the soft metal. The electrotype then comes into\r\nplay, exact copies of the impression being taken by it. As the face of\r\nthe electrotyped plate is covered with a slight deposit of some hard\r\nmetal, usually nickel, a great number of copies can be taken without\r\ndamaging the plate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA WONDERFULLY exact parallel to Nature-printing is seen in almost every\r\ncoal bed. In the coal are found impressions of various leaves, mostly\r\nferns, and so exact are they, that the different species have been\r\ndetermined and named with as much accuracy as if, instead of mere\r\nimpressions, they had been the fern-leaves themselves.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if it were needed, it would be perfectly easy to take\r\nelectrotype plates from these impressions, and to treat them in exactly\r\nthe same manner as those obtained in the way which has already been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIPPLING.\r\n\r\nWe now come to another branch of Art, namely, the production of shadow\r\nin an engraving by means of Stippling, i.e. the insertion of dots\r\ninstead of lines. At one time the Stipple was in great favour. Then it\r\nwas almost wholly abandoned in favour of the line, and now it is much\r\nused in conjunction with the line, especially for the delicate shading\r\nof flesh tints, such as faces, female arms, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration a little stippling of a cheek is shown, the dots\r\nbeing purposely exaggerated.\r\n\r\nA singularly beautiful modification of the Stipple is now in use. When\r\nthe engraver wishes for exceptional softness of shading, he does not\r\ncontent himself with mere dots, but, with the aid of his\r\nmagnifying-glass, converts each dot into a tiny star with three or more\r\nrays. Thus the dots seem to melt into each other, and the requisite\r\nsoftness is obtained.\r\n\r\nA very good example of this star-stipple is seen in the well-known print\r\ncalled “Coming of Age.” If the face and neck of the girl in the\r\nforeground be examined with a magnifying-glass, the apparent dots will\r\nbe seen to be stars, so beautifully arranged that the projecting rays of\r\none fuse themselves, so to speak, with, those of the surrounding stars,\r\nas is shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHETHER the engraver who hit upon this singularly effective plan took it\r\nfrom Nature, I cannot say, but he well might have done so, had he\r\nexamined the petal of a flower through a good microscope. We all know\r\nthe peculiar rich softness of a petal, and how our very best floral\r\nartists feel the impossibility of transferring it to paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STIPPLING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETAL OF GERANIUM.]\r\n\r\nThe real reason for this special beauty lies in the star-stippling of\r\nthe petal. The whole surface of the petal is covered with multitudinous\r\nprojections, which are, in fact, undeveloped hairs. These projections\r\nare wrinkled down the sides, and so, when viewed from above, they\r\npresent the curious star-like appearance shown on the right hand of the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThe drawing is taken from a petal of Pelargonium prepared by myself.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one point in the petal which the star-stipple has not\r\ntouched, and probably cannot touch. I mean the slight projection of the\r\nstipple-hairs, which give an effect of light and shade as well as mere\r\nflat softness.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLASTER CASTS.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the electrotype, and may now come to a branch\r\nof art which is much associated with it, namely, the Stereotype.\r\n\r\nAs many of my readers may know, types are very valuable articles, and\r\nmust not be wasted. If, therefore, a book should be thought likely to\r\nhave a steady sale, much of its value would be lost if the types were\r\nkept standing, inasmuch as they could not be used for any other work.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the Stereotype is employed. Omitting minute details, the\r\nprocess is as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHELL-CAST IN CHALK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAST IN PLASTER OF PARIS.]\r\n\r\nThe type, ready set up, is carefully oiled. Plaster of Paris mixed with\r\nwater is then poured into a shallow trough, and the type pressed into\r\nit. In a short time the plaster hardens, and the type is withdrawn. The\r\nplaster mould is then baked, to drive off all moisture, and type metal\r\nis poured into it. Thus a solid mass is procured, instead of a number of\r\nseparate pieces, so that there is no danger of disturbance, and the\r\nwhole block can be multiplied _ad libitum_ if needed. This process sets\r\nfree the types, which can be broken up and used again.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary method of taking plaster casts is nearly the same as that\r\nwhich has been described. The object to be cast is oiled, and plaster of\r\nParis carefully applied to it. When it is “set,” the plaster “mould” is\r\nremoved and dried. The process is then reversed, the interior of the\r\nmould being oiled, and plaster poured into it, so as to produce an exact\r\nreproduction of the original.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature we have almost exactly the same process, although it is\r\nnecessarily conducted in a much slower manner.\r\n\r\nAll who have tried their hand at practical geology must be aware of the\r\nmultitudinous casts of perished beings which are found in various\r\nstrata. Sometimes the casts are those of vegetables, the original\r\nmaterial having been decomposed, and stony matter taken its place.\r\nSometimes there are casts of fishes or echini, while shells, and even\r\ninsects, are found to have been cast almost as perfectly as could be\r\ndone with plaster of Paris at the present day.\r\n\r\nAs might be anticipated, the chalk deposits are peculiarly rich in these\r\ncasts, the fine particles of the chalk taking the place of the plaster\r\nof Paris.\r\n\r\nIn the illustrations are shown examples of casting in Art and Nature. On\r\nthe right hand is a cast of fruit and leaves, which may afterwards be\r\nreproduced in plaster, wax, papier-mâché, or electrotype. On the left is\r\nshown one of the shells so common in the chalk, the upper figure\r\nrepresenting the shell itself, and the lower the mould that has been\r\nformed around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRUGATED IRON.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the Wasps are paper-makers. We may now see how\r\nsome of the Wasps have anticipated a valuable invention of man, namely,\r\nthe principle of corrugation, whereby a thin plate gains strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NESTS OF POLISTES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORRUGATED IRON.]\r\n\r\nEven a sheet of paper gains great strength by corrugation, as is seen in\r\nthose paper covers which are so much in use for the decoration, or\r\nrather the concealment, of flower-pots. But the best example that can be\r\ngiven of this principle is the Corrugated Iron, which has come so much\r\ninto use for temporary buildings, such as schools, places of worship,\r\nreading-rooms, &c. It is very light and very strong, and can be used\r\neither for roof or walls with equal success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBY means of certain wasps belonging to the genus Polistes, Nature\r\nproduces corrugated dwellings, which are made of very thin materials,\r\nbut which are marvellously strong in proportion to their weight.\r\n\r\nThe insects belonging to this genus are all exotic, but are spread over\r\na very large surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nSo strong are the nests made by some of these species, that they need no\r\nexternal covering, the corrugated paper supplying at the same time\r\nstrength and warmth, the latter element being furnished by the air which\r\nis entangled between the corrugations.\r\n\r\nThere are many species of Polistes, mostly belonging to Australasia and\r\ntropical America, the latter displaying the greatest variety of form and\r\nstructure in the nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n     Electricity, Magnetism, and Galvanism mutually convertible.--The\r\n     Force co-extensive with Nature.--Uses of Thunder-storms.--Languor\r\n     from Want of Electricity.--Frictional and Voltaic\r\n     Electricity.--Origin of the Name.--Structure of the Voltaic\r\n     Pile.--A simple Example of the Pile.--Nerves of a Frog’s Leg.--The\r\n     Electric Shock, and how to produce it.--The Electric Jar and\r\n     Battery.--Animal Electricity.--The Torpedo and Electric\r\n     Eel.--Structure of the Electric Apparatus.--The Electric Spark\r\n     obtained from both Fishes.--Channels of Electricity in the\r\n     Body.--The Will and the Muscles.--Electricity the conducting\r\n     Agent.--The Human Body permeated by Nerves.--Telegraph Wires and\r\n     the Nervous System.--Lightning and the Electric Spark.--The\r\n     Electric Light and its Power.--The Fire-fly, the Glow-worm, and the\r\n     luminous Inhabitants of the Sea.--Magnetism and Diamagnetism.--The\r\n     Electric Telegraph and the Compass.--The Principle identical in\r\n     both Instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that Electricity, Galvanism, and Magnetism are\r\nbut different manifestations of the same force, and that one can be\r\nconverted into the other at will. It is also known that this wonderful\r\nand most important principle lies latent in everything, and only needs\r\nthe proper machinery to evoke it.\r\n\r\nThe few following illustrations are intended to show its prevalence in\r\nNature, and that human art does not create, but only makes manifest a\r\npower that exists, but lies latent until called forth.\r\n\r\nWithout going into details, which would occupy the whole of such a\r\nvolume as this, I may mention that Electricity saturates all the\r\nmaterial creation, and that even man himself is not only a reservoir of\r\nelectricity, but that he feels positively ill if the normal amount be\r\nnot supplied.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the hours that precede a thunder-storm. We feel\r\nlanguid and depressed. We cannot bring our thoughts together. We are\r\nalmost incapable even of bodily labour. The reason is, that the portion\r\nof the earth on which we live has parted with some of its electricity,\r\nand has drawn it out of our bodies.\r\n\r\nThen comes the welcome thunder-storm; clouds overcharged with\r\nelectricity come to restore the balance. The lightning flashes from the\r\nclouds to the earth as soon as they are near enough; the rain falls,\r\ncarrying with it stores of silent electricity; and in an hour or two all\r\nseems changed.\r\n\r\nThe air, which hitherto seemed to afford no nourishment to the lungs, is\r\nbracing and invigorating. The nervous system recovers its tension, and\r\nthe brain can act without a painful effect. All Nature seems to put on a\r\ndifferent aspect, and brightness and vigour take the place of dulness\r\nand languor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALVANISING A FROG’S LEG.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOLTAIC PILE.]\r\n\r\nBy a strange coincidence, there is just such a lack of electricity as I\r\nam writing, and the barometer has rapidly sunk to such a degree that a\r\nstorm seems inevitable.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief difficulties in dealing with such a subject as this is\r\nto know where to begin. We will, however, do our best to take a general\r\nview of it, without going into details.\r\n\r\nMany centuries ago it was well known that amber, if rubbed with a dry\r\ncloth, would first attract, and then repel, various small and light\r\nsubstances. Indeed, the Greek word for amber, namely, _Elektron_, has\r\ngiven its name to the modern science of Electricity. Many other\r\nsubstances, such as glass, sealing-wax, &c., possess the same property.\r\n\r\nThis frictional electricity is but transient, the electric fluid, if we\r\nmay be allowed to use the term, being driven out by main force from the\r\nmaterial in which it was latent, just as fire is procured by the\r\nfriction of two dry sticks. There is, however, a form of Electricity\r\ncalled Galvanism, from its discoverer, Galvani, who, somewhere about\r\n1790, discovered that the limbs of a dead frog might be excited to\r\naction by electricity applied to the nerves.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, Volta of Pavia, from whom the Voltaic Pile is named, took up\r\nGalvani’s discoveries, and produced electricity without friction, by the\r\ncontact of differently conducting substances.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand figure represents the Voltaic Pile. It is composed of a\r\nseries of plates arranged in the following manner--Zinc, Silver, and\r\nCloth, the whole being moistened with diluted acid. Copper will answer\r\nthe purpose nearly as well as silver, and is not so costly. A very\r\nsimple mode of demonstrating the presence of electricity is by taking a\r\npiece of zinc and a silver coin, and placing one below and the other\r\nabove the tongue. If the two be then brought together, a very peculiar\r\ntaste is perceived, and a sudden flash of light seems to pass across the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents on the right hand the Voltaic Pile as at\r\npresent made, and on the left are the two hind-legs of a frog, with the\r\nupper part of the nerves made bare for the purpose of experimenting. The\r\ndotted lines show the extent of the movements of the leg when the\r\ngalvanic current is passed through the nerves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOW we come to a plan whereby electricity can be accumulated, or locked\r\nup, so to speak, and be discharged at once with a definite shock instead\r\nof being poured away by degrees. This can be done in many ways, the most\r\ncommon being that which is known by the name of the Electric Jar. It is\r\na glass vessel coated within and without with tin-foil, and having a\r\nmetal rod passing through the cork in such a way that while the lower\r\nend is in contact with the inner coating of tin-foil, the other end is\r\nguarded by a ball.\r\n\r\nElectricity is now poured into the interior of the jar, and, when\r\ncontact is made between the inner and outer coatings, a sudden discharge\r\ntakes place. If a number of persons hold each other’s hands, and those\r\nwho form the two extremities touch the outer coating and the ball which\r\ncommunicates with the inner coating, a sharp discharge is at once made,\r\npassing through all the bodies, and inflicting a smart shock, especially\r\nat the elbows.\r\n\r\nSimilar effects can be produced with the Voltaic Battery, but, as that\r\ninstrument has already been figured, the Electric Jar has been selected.\r\nOf course any number of such jars can be connected together, and the\r\nshock will be proportionately increased in intensity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Nature we have several-parallels. Putting aside the obvious one of a\r\nlightning-flash, which has already been mentioned, we pass to two\r\nremarkable examples of the capability of animal structure to produce\r\nelectricity, to store it up, so to speak, and discharge it at will. Both\r\nthese creatures are fishes, one belonging to the Skates or Rays, and the\r\nother to the Eels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTORPEDO.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EEL.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC BATTERY.]\r\n\r\nThe upper figure on the left-hand side of the illustration represents\r\nthe Torpedo, sometimes called the Cramp-fish, Numb-fish, or Electric\r\nRay. Fortunately for us, it is but seldom found on our coasts, but it is\r\ntolerably common in the warmer parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe electric organ in this fish is double, and so large that its shape\r\ncan easily be recognised even through the skin. It is made up of a vast\r\nnumber of discs arranged upon each other in columns like the metallic\r\nportions of the Voltaic Pile, and separated from each other by delicate\r\nmembranes, which take the place of the cloth. When I mention that more\r\nthan eleven hundred columns have been found in a single Torpedo, and\r\nthat each column contains several hundred discs, it may be imagined that\r\nthe shock which such a creature can give must be a very powerful one.\r\n\r\nThe object of this power seems to be analogous to that of the venomous\r\nserpent, _i.e._ to enable the creature to secure its prey by either\r\nkilling it or rendering it temporarily insensible by an electric shock.\r\nAs if to show that the delivery of the shock is achieved by an exertion\r\nof will, observers have noticed that just before the shock is delivered,\r\nthe eyes are depressed in the head like those of a toad when swallowing\r\na large insect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA STILL more powerfully electric animal is the Electric Eel of Southern\r\nAmerica. It sometimes attains a length of six feet, and its electric\r\norgans are four times as proportionately large as those of the torpedo.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt as to the object of the electric power of this eel, as\r\nI have often seen it kill fish, and then eat them.\r\n\r\nWhen about to deliver its shock, it curves its body towards the intended\r\nvictim, stiffens itself, and with a sort of shudder the electric fluid\r\nis emitted. The fish at which it is aimed never seems to escape, but,\r\nsimultaneously with the shudder on the part of the Electric Eel, turns\r\non its back and lies motionless until it is picked up by its destroyer.\r\n\r\nNeither the Torpedo nor the Electric Eel has unlimited stores of\r\nelectricity. If irritated into delivering repeated shocks, each\r\ndischarge is less powerful than its predecessor, until at last the\r\ncreature is almost wholly powerless, and must rest and recruit itself\r\nbefore it can lay up fresh stores of the electric fluid.\r\n\r\nI may add that the electric spark has been obtained from both these\r\nfishes. It was only a small spark, but in such experiments a small spark\r\nis as satisfactory as a large one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHAT are the channels by which the electric fluid is transmitted through\r\nour bodies?\r\n\r\nThey are the nerves, which convey from and to the brain a subtle fluid,\r\nif it may be so called, just as the arteries and veins convey blood to\r\nand from the heart. If any of these nerves be electrified, even after\r\nthe death of the animal, or after the separation of a limb from the\r\nbody, muscular movements are induced, and the limb moves as if instinct\r\nwith life.\r\n\r\nWithout these nerves we should be unable to feel the severest shock, but\r\nthey permeate the body so completely, that not a part of the skin can be\r\npricked without a nerve being wounded.\r\n\r\nIt is by means of these conductors that the will is made to act upon the\r\nlimbs. The mind, for example, desires the legs to walk, and they do so,\r\nthe order being transmitted to them through the nerves.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, we are unconscious of this process. But, when paralysis takes\r\nplace, and the nerves refuse to perform their functions, the will is\r\nabsolutely useless, and, however desirous a man may be of walking, he\r\ncannot move a step if the nerves of his legs are paralyzed. In cases\r\nwhere the paralysis comes on slowly and in detail, the patient mostly\r\nbecomes conscious of the part played by the nerves, and feels that his\r\nwill can to a certain degree rouse the expiring powers of the nerve\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nThis in its turn is but the conductor for another and infinitely more\r\nsubtle fluid, of which our space will not allow us to treat, but which\r\nforms the connecting link between body and spirit. Perhaps some of my\r\nreaders may have seen those curious preparations of the human form, when\r\nthe arteries have been injected with red wax, and the veins with blue\r\nwax, and then the fleshy portions dissolved away by chemical means.\r\n\r\nThe result is a perfect human form, and even to the very tips of the\r\nfingers and toes the blood-vessels follow the contour of the body. Did\r\nwe have means of injecting the nervous system, we should arrive at\r\nsimilar results, except that the nerves would be found infinitely more\r\nintricate than the veins and arteries. Thus a human being is a series of\r\nhuman forms, interwoven with each other, and mutually dependent on each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is curious to see how the great discoveries of modern days have but\r\ncopied Nature.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the network of telegraphic wires which is day by day\r\nspreading itself over the surface of the earth, and the parallel will\r\nat once be visible. Just as the brain transmits its message to the limbs\r\nby means of the nerves, so does the same brain transmit its message\r\nthrough thousands of miles, by utilising the wires which are but the\r\nrough and coarse imitations of the wonderful nervous system of the human\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE illustration shows the parallelism as well as can be done by a mere\r\nchart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NERVES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TELEGRAPHIC WIRES.]\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand side is shown the manner in which a nerve-group is\r\ndistributed to different parts of the body. On the right the railway\r\ntelegraph wires are seen, and, as the reader will probably remember,\r\nbranch wires are carried into the signal boxes, just as branch nerves\r\nare carried to the most distant parts of the body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI HAVE already mentioned the Electric Spark, and that it is, in fact, a\r\nminiature lightning-flash, the little crackling report being a miniature\r\nthunder-clap. It can be produced by frictional electricity, or by the\r\nvoltaic pile in its many variations, or by animal substances alone, as\r\nin the case of the torpedo and electric eel.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a modification of the spark, whereby a continuous current\r\nof electricity is sent through two charcoal points, and inflames them\r\nwith such intensity that the eye cannot look upon its dazzling\r\nwhiteness. There is none of the yellowness about it which is so great a\r\ndrawback to our artificial lights, whether they be gas, candle, or lamp,\r\nand which makes ladies’ dresses that are really beautiful by day look\r\ndull and almost ugly by night.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful to see how the Electric Light kills all other lights.\r\nThe brightest gas becomes dull, and its shadow is thrown on the wall\r\nwhich it formerly illuminated, and the most delicate tints of silks and\r\nsatins suddenly display themselves in the blinding whiteness of the\r\nElectric Light.\r\n\r\nAt present it is too costly to be brought into common use, but its\r\nintensity is so great that serious ideas have been formed of dispensing\r\nwith street lamps altogether, and illuminating towns with a few electric\r\nlamps placed at a considerable height, and having their beams reflected\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nLIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nFIRE-FLY.\r\n\r\nGLOW-WORM.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nLondon is thought to be a specially fit subject for this mode of\r\nlighting, as the electric beams can pierce the fogs which the gas-lamp\r\nonly augments, and give the traveller some hope of finding his way\r\nthrough the most familiar streets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the illustration the right-hand figure represents the Electric Light\r\nas at present in use. The upper portion of the left-hand side represents\r\nthe forked lightning, whose dazzling whiteness is so familiar to us,\r\neven in the noon of a summer’s day.\r\n\r\nBelow are shown the Fire-fly of warm climates, and the Glow-worm, which,\r\nin our comparatively cool country, cheers the summer evenings with its\r\npale lamp. As to the source of this mysterious light, which burns\r\nwithout producing heat sufficient to be recognised by our most delicate\r\ninstruments, we know but little.\r\n\r\nThere are instruments so infinitely more sensitive than the best\r\nthermometer, that they will record instantaneously an increase of heat\r\nif a human being passes in front of them, though at several yards’\r\ndistance. Yet no effect is produced on them by any of the Fire-flies or\r\nthe Glow-worm. The spectroscope itself gives little or no information,\r\nthe spectrum of the light being without bands or bars, and being what is\r\ntechnically called a “continuous” spectrum.\r\n\r\nLast year I tried numbers of Glow-worms with the spectroscope, and\r\nalways with the same result. I never saw the Fire-flies alive, but, no\r\nmatter what may be the colour of the light, the spectrum, whether of the\r\nGlow-worm or any of the Fire-flies, seems to be always continuous, and\r\nso to give but little information as to its source.\r\n\r\nThere appears, however, to be little doubt that animal electricity is\r\nthe real cause of this curious phenomenon, and that the force which is\r\nexpended in the torpedo and electric eel, in giving shocks accompanied\r\nby slight electric sparks, may develop itself in these insects by\r\nproducing a continuous light. And just as the electric fishes can emit\r\nor withhold the shock as they please, so can the Fire-flies and\r\nGlow-worms give out or retain the light by which they are so well known.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the multitudinous luminous inhabitants of the sea,\r\nwhich, as many of my readers have probably seen, convert the waves into\r\nrolling masses of living fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nNow we come to another condition of electrical force, called MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nOne form of it is strongly developed in the Loadstone, an ore of iron.\r\nThis ore has the property of turning east and west when suspended\r\nfreely, it attracts any object made of iron, and can communicate its\r\npowers to iron by merely stroking it. There is in the Museum at Oxford a\r\nsplendid specimen of the Loadstone, which has imparted its virtues to\r\nthousands of iron magnets, and has lost none of its virtues by so doing.\r\n\r\nAll bodies are now known to be magnetic in some way or other. Several,\r\nsuch as iron, nickel, and one or two other metals, turn north and south\r\nwhen suspended on a pivot, but the great bulk of other bodies turn east\r\nand west, and are called Diamagnetics.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, the property of turning north and south has been\r\nutilised in the Compass, without which modern science would be\r\nparalyzed, and travel rendered impossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOADSTONE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPASS.]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that although the magnetic needle of the compass\r\nturns to the north, it does not do so because it is attracted by the\r\nnorth pole, but because it is repelled from the east and west.\r\n\r\nWe have long known that if a current of electricity be sent round a\r\nmagnetic needle, the latter at once turns at right angles to it. On this\r\nprinciple depends the Electric Telegraph. When communication is made by\r\nusing the handles, a current of electricity is sent round the needles,\r\nand causes them to turn at right angles until stopped by a little ivory\r\npin, which prevents them from overshooting themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is a perpetual stream of electricity passing over the earth from\r\neast to west, and in consequence all magnetic bodies are forced to turn\r\nat right angles, just as is the case with the magnetic needle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTILLAGE.--DRAINAGE.--SPIRAL PRINCIPLE.--CENTRIFUGAL FORCE.\r\n\r\n     Systems of cultivating Ground.--The Fallow System.--Manuring the\r\n     Ground.--Custom of China.--Nature’s Abhorrence of Waste.--What\r\n     becomes of Dead Animals.--Burying-beetles.--The Scarabæus-beetles\r\n     and their Work.--Drainage _versus_ Sewage.--Clay Soils and\r\n     Drains.--The Mole, the Earth-worm, Rats, Mice, and Rabbits.--The\r\n     Flexible Drain and the Lobster’s Tail.--The Turbine Pump and the\r\n     Ascidian.--The Spiral Principle.--The Smoke-jack, Kite, and Wings\r\n     of Birds.--Centrifugal Force.--Revolution of Planets.--The\r\n     “Governor” of the Steam-engine.--The Sling, Amentum, and Mop.--The\r\n     Gyroscope, the Bicycle, and the Hoop.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral times, in the course of this work, we have touched upon man’s\r\ndealings with the earth, such as mining and tunnelling. We will now take\r\nanother side of the same question, and, in connection with Tillage,\r\nconsider Drainage, whereby superabundant moisture is removed from the\r\nearth, and Manuring, whereby the exhausted soil is renovated.\r\n\r\nWe will take this subject first.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that it is impossible to get more out of the\r\nground than exists in it, and that when the soil has been so worked as\r\nto become unproductive, there are only two remedies. The one is to allow\r\nthe ground to remain uncultivated for a time. It must be ploughed in\r\ndeeply, as if it were to be sown with a crop, and must be left to\r\nrecruit itself from the air. This is the now abandoned “fallow” system,\r\nwhich used to be in full operation when I was a child.\r\n\r\nAs, however, population increased, and with it the perpetually\r\nincreasing demand for food, land was found to be too precious to be\r\nallowed to lie fallow and idle. Then came the system of rotation of\r\ncrops, potato following wheat, clover following potato, &c. But, above\r\nall, agriculturists learned that in the long-run there is nothing so\r\ncheap as manure, i.e. the return to the soil by animals of the elements\r\nwhich these animals took out of it.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the illustration (page 495) is shown the simplest\r\nmode of enriching the soil, namely, by spreading the manure on the\r\nsurface of the earth, and then digging it in. Any mode of thus enriching\r\nthe earth is a proof of civilisation. No savage ever dreamed of such a\r\nthing, and I doubt whether barbarians recognised the principle at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNowadays we have recognised the necessity of returning to the soil in\r\none form the elements which we have taken from it in another. As usual\r\nin such arts of civilisation, the Chinese have long preceded us. They\r\nwaste nothing, carrying, perhaps, its principles to an extent which\r\nscarcely suits our European ideas.\r\n\r\nThey even utilise the little clippings of hair, to which every Chinaman\r\nis almost daily subject, if he wishes to keep up his self-respect in\r\npublic. The barbers carefully preserve these clippings, and sell them to\r\ngardeners. They are too precious to be used in general agriculture, but\r\nthe flower artist, when he plants the seed, puts in the same hole a\r\nlittle pinch of human hair, knowing it to be a strong stimulant to\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWITHOUT multiplying examples of artificial manuring, most of which are\r\ntoo familiar to need description, we will proceed to the methods by\r\nwhich Nature has for countless centuries achieved the same work that Man\r\nhas lately learned to undertake.\r\n\r\nNature abhors waste, and in the long-run will prove it, however wasteful\r\nmay be the ways of her servants. Take, for example, the case of an\r\nordinary tree, such as an elm, an oak, or a birch. In the autumn the\r\nleaves fall. In the next summer scarcely a dead leaf can be found. They\r\nhave been decomposed by rain, dews, and gases, and have thus returned to\r\nthe earth more than the nutriment which they took out of it.\r\n\r\nHere man is apt to interfere. Knowing the invaluable productive powers\r\nof decayed leaves, he removes them as they fall, and stores them in\r\nheaps so as to form the costly, but almost indispensable, “leaf mould.”\r\nIn so doing, however, he deprives the trees of their natural nutriment,\r\nand by degrees they dwindle and die.\r\n\r\nNature, in this case, shows her superiority over Art.\r\n\r\nThen we have the remarkable fact that millions of animated beings die\r\nannually, and no vestige of their remains is found. Hyænas and vultures\r\nmight account for a few bodies, the remnants of which have been found in\r\nancient caverns. But there is no hyæna which could crush the leg bones\r\nof an adult elephant; and yet I suppose that neither in Africa nor Asia\r\nhas any one discovered the body of an elephant or rhinoceros that had\r\ndied a natural death.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is the curious point, which I have already\r\nmentioned, and which is shared by nearly every race of human savages,\r\nthat when an animal feels that it has received its death-stroke, it\r\naccepts the conditions, withdraws itself from those who yet have life in\r\nthem, and yields up its life as calmly as if it were but sleeping.\r\n\r\nBut what becomes of the body? As to such enormous beings as elephants,\r\nthe various species of rhinoceros, and whales, which are as large as\r\nseveral elephants, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus put together, I cannot\r\nsay from practical knowledge.\r\n\r\nStill, as size is only comparative, the rule that holds good with a\r\nsmall animal may hold equally good with a large one. It is my lot to\r\nwalk very often upon the banks of the Thames. It is a charming walk at\r\nhigh water, but at low water there is too much odoriferous mud, and\r\nthere are too many dead dogs and cats to make it an agreeable resort,\r\nexcept for enthusiastic entomologists, who seem to swarm in this\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nScarcely has such a carcass been stranded than it is beset by\r\nBurying-beetles of various kinds. Hundreds upon hundreds can be shaken\r\nout of the corpse of a dog or cat, and, before the next tide has come\r\nup, there is scarcely any flesh left on the bones, it having been dug\r\ninto the earth by the Burying-beetles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHEN there is that wonderful family of Scarabæus-beetles, which do us\r\ninvaluable service as scavengers and agriculturists. They follow the\r\npath of the caravans, and effectively cleanse the course which has been\r\ntraversed. Even man is obliged to utilise as fuel the droppings of the\r\nhorses, cows, and camels; but the Scarabæus goes further, collecting all\r\nthat man does not need, and burying it in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of the female Scarabæus urges it to gather together the\r\nrejecta, to form them into balls, placing an egg in the middle of each\r\nball, and to bury them in the ground. Thus a double object is attained,\r\nthe offensive substances being removed from the surface of the ground,\r\nwhere they do harm, and being transferred below the surface, where they\r\ndo good.\r\n\r\nEven the curious instinct of the dog, which leads it to bury bones, &c.,\r\nwhich it cannot consume, and which it often forgets, if well fed, leaves\r\nthem to be consumed by the all-absorbing earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCARABÆUS-BEETLES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEN MANURING GROUND.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, in the end, the earth _must_ receive back again that\r\nwhich has been taken from it. If, for example, we follow the present\r\nmost wasteful plan of drainage, and fling into rivers everything which\r\nought to be utilised on land, it only gets into the sea in the end, and\r\nin the course of years is decomposed, and returns to the earth in the\r\nform of gases. Meanwhile, however, we have robbed the locality, deprived\r\nit of the nourishment which it required, and forced ourselves to supply\r\nit elsewhere at a costly rate.\r\n\r\nSo runs the cycle of creation. Sooner or later, Nature will have her\r\nway, and the more we help her, the better it will be for us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOF course I do not mean to condemn Drainage, which is an absolute\r\nnecessity in agriculture, and a matter of life and death in households.\r\nBut, when rightly conducted, it only signifies that water is removed\r\nfrom a spot which is overstocked with moisture to one where it is\r\nneeded. Wet clay lands, for example, which were unproductive in point of\r\ncrops, and injurious in point of human health, have been converted by\r\njudicious drainage into fertile and healthy grounds.\r\n\r\nThis, as it will be seen, is a very different business from removing\r\nfrom the soil the elements which rightly belong to it, and which sooner\r\nor later, in some form or another, it will claim and recapture.\r\n\r\nStill, it is evident that in the progress of civilisation there must be\r\naccumulations of all kinds of refuse, which savages utterly disregard.\r\nThen we come to the question of the Drain combined with the Sewer, and\r\nare enabled to see how the hand of man, if properly directed, only\r\nfollows the course of Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUNNEL OF MOLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEWER.]\r\n\r\nSo we undermine our towns with a complex system of drains which are\r\nunderstood by only a very few people. For example, just as a tree is\r\nonly half visible, the roots being about equivalent to the branches,\r\nLondon is only half visible, the subterranean architecture being little,\r\nif at all, inferior to that of the surface.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we are met by Nature. Very few of us can appreciate the\r\nextensive subterranean works which underlie us, even where the hand of\r\nman has never been placed. Putting aside a multitude of tiny creatures,\r\nthere are, in our own country, the earth-worms which pierce the ground\r\nin all directions, at the same time draining and manuring it. They\r\npenetrate it with their little burrows, thus admitting the air, which\r\nthe earth needs as much as we do, and allowing moisture to take its\r\nright place. Then there are the moles, that are perpetually travelling\r\nafter the earth-worms, and making drainage galleries of wonderful\r\nextent. Then there are the numerous other burrowers, such as rabbits,\r\nmice, and rats, which are common everywhere, besides the less plentiful\r\nfoxes, badgers, and various burrowing birds, all of which assist more or\r\nless in the drainage of the earth.\r\n\r\nEven bees and wasps of different kinds assist in this work, the hardest\r\nsoil yielding to their small, though powerful, jaws and feet, and so\r\nbeing made, if only temporarily, able to carry off the superabundant\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAIL OF LOBSTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLEXIBLE WATER MAIN.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most ingenious modes of Drainage was that which was invented\r\nby Watts, and was avowedly based on Nature. He had engaged himself to\r\ncarry a drain tube through, or rather over, an extremely irregular bed\r\nof a river, where the pipes must accommodate themselves to existing\r\nconditions. The modern system of pipes not having been brought into\r\nexistence, Watts had to adapt himself to circumstances, and did so by\r\nmaking his pipe on the model of a Lobster’s tail, as shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the same object has been utilised in warfare as\r\na pattern for armour, but it does seem rather strange that it should be\r\nemployed in the tranquil arts of peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER method of removing superfluous water is by the TURBINE PUMP, by\r\nwhich the water, instead of being cast up in successive jets, was flung\r\nout in a continuous torrent. Some of my readers may remember the\r\nsensation which was created at the first Exhibition of 1852 by the then\r\nextraordinary powers of the Turbine Pump.\r\n\r\nYet this is, after all, nothing but an imperfect copy of the now\r\ncelebrated being to which human beings have been supposed to owe their\r\norigin, namely, the Ascidian, popularly known by the name of the\r\nSea-squirt, and with very good reasons.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it keeps up a rotation of tentacles, such as is shown in the\r\nillustration, acting exactly on the principle of the Turbine Pump, and\r\ndrawing in and discharging water with a power that is perfectly\r\nastonishing in so small a being. Beside this, it has the power of\r\nflinging out at once the whole of its watery contents, and any one who\r\nhas incautiously handled a mass of Ascidians, and been drenched by them,\r\ncan answer with more truth than satisfaction as to the water-absorbing\r\npower of the Turbine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASCIDIAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURBINE PUMP.]\r\n\r\nThen the Ascidian can do what the Turbine cannot do. In the Turbine the\r\nwater which is taken in must necessarily be ejected in equal\r\nproportions. With the Ascidian the same thing takes place, but with the\r\nadditional power of ejecting all the contained water, and then beginning\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\nThere is now no doubt that the Circular or the Turbine Pump is the most\r\npowerful in such cases as emptying mines of the water which, in spite of\r\nall precautions, will make its way in, and destroy the labours of the\r\nminers. But I merely wish to carry out the object of this work by\r\nremarking that the invaluable Turbine Pump is only a very inferior copy\r\nof a natural pump, which existed, as far as we know, centuries before\r\nMan could find his place upon this earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRAL.\r\n\r\nIn an early portion of this work the Spiral or Screw was touched upon,\r\nmostly in connection with the propulsion of vessels. We will now extend\r\nit a little further, and see how it is modified so as to perform other\r\noffices than those which have been described.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the Spiral or Wedge principle, but\r\nsome of the illustrations were accidentally omitted. I therefore\r\nintroduce them here, this being a chapter of miscellanea.\r\n\r\nThe Windmill has previously been described, as has also the ship’s\r\nScrew, another form of which is here given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRDS’ WINGS AND TAILS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMOKE-JACK. SHIP’S SCREW. WINDMILL. KITE.]\r\n\r\nIn the centre is shown the mechanism popularly known as the Smoke-jack,\r\nthough it really works by means of hot air, and only becomes gradually\r\nchoked by the soot which the smoke by degrees deposits upon it. It is,\r\nin fact, nothing but a windmill working horizontally instead of\r\nvertically, the vanes being moved by the rapidly ascending heated air.\r\nSo powerful is the spiral pressure of this air, that in my old college\r\ndays at least a dozen rows of heavily laden spits were perpetually\r\nturned by a single Smoke-jack. It is many years since I visited my old\r\ncollege, and I cannot say whether the Smoke-jack still exists, but, as\r\nit did its work well so long ago, I presume that it does so now.\r\n\r\nThen there is the well-known spiral ventilator set in the windows of\r\nworkshops. Perhaps its revolution may not assist the air-current, but it\r\ndoes, at all events, show how much exhausted air has to be expelled from\r\nthe room, and consequently how much fresh air needs to be brought into\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPERHAPS the reader may be surprised to see that the Wings and Tail of a\r\nbird and a boy’s Kite are placed among the examples of the Spiral\r\nprinciple. Yet such is the fact. If the reader will move up and down the\r\nwings of any bird which will not bite him, he will find that there is in\r\nthem a peculiar screwing motion, difficult of description, but very\r\nobservable.\r\n\r\nIt is mostly for want of this movement that all our attempts at fitting\r\nwings to human beings have been such utter failures. We can make the\r\nwings work up and down well enough, but we cannot as yet impart to them\r\nthe all-important spiral movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHAT very well-known toy, the Kite, is another example of the same\r\nprinciple which drives the screw steamer. Its “tail,” which need be\r\nnothing but a piece of string with a proportionate weight at the end,\r\nkeeps the Kite in a slanting position, providing that the “belly-band”\r\nbe properly arranged. The consequence is that the pressure of the wind\r\nacts on it as on a wedge, and so drives it upwards until the combined\r\nweight of itself and the string counterbalance the upward pressure.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the only object of the string is to keep the Kite at a proper\r\ninclination; and, if that object could be attained by the force of\r\ngravity alone, the Kite would ascend to a height nearly double that to\r\nwhich it can at present attain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRIFUGAL FORCE.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the spiral principle is Centrifugal Force, that\r\nmarvellous power which gives to our whole solar system its ceaseless\r\nmovements, and may extend, as far as we know, to other and vaster\r\nsystems yet unknown.\r\n\r\nTie a ball to a string, and swing it round, and it will be an exact,\r\nthough rough, representation of the double power by which the movements\r\nof the heavenly bodies are governed, our earth being included among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe string represents the force of attraction, which binds all our\r\nplanets to the sun, and their satellites to the planets, while the force\r\nthat is employed in swinging the ball represents the mysterious power\r\nthat issues from the sun, and gives motion to the planets. The metaphor\r\nis a very homely one, but it is nevertheless correct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the accompanying illustration are several examples of Centrifugal\r\nForce as found both in Nature and Art. On the left hand we have diagrams\r\nof some of the heavenly bodies, showing the revolution of their\r\noffspring, so to call them, while on the right are seen examples of\r\nCentrifugal Force as applied to human use. For convenience’ sake, the\r\nillustrations have been separated into two portions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRIFUGAL FORCE OF HEAVENLY BODIES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRIFUGAL FORCE OF “GOVERNORS” OF ENGINE. SLING.\r\nAMENTUM AND MOP.]\r\n\r\nIn the first of these illustrations we have the “Governor” of the\r\nsteam-engine, that wonderfully ingenious and simple piece of mechanism\r\nwhich controls the force of the steam, and, without the superintendence\r\nof man, acts almost as a living being might.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of two heavy metal balls, hinged, as shown in the\r\nillustration, to a movable collar which slides up and down the central\r\nrod. When the engine is at work the Governor revolves, and the harder it\r\nworks, the more rapid is the revolution. Consequently, as it revolves,\r\nthe balls diverge and draw the sliding collar up the rod.\r\n\r\nHere lies the whole beauty of the invention. The sliding collar is\r\nconnected with the safety-valve. Thus, if the engine should be working\r\nbeyond its proper powers, the Governor draws up the collar, and releases\r\nsufficient steam to take the undue pressure off the boiler. Thus the\r\nengine may be left, so to speak, to manage itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT are shown two examples of Centrifugal Force as applied in ancient\r\nwarfare, namely, the Sling, which is now retained merely as a boy’s toy,\r\nand the Amentum, which was practically a sling attached to a spear. Both\r\nweapons have been superseded by the modern firearms, but the Sling is\r\nreally a more formidable offensive weapon, in skilful hands, than is\r\ngenerally suspected.\r\n\r\nA good slinger is as sure of his aim as a good rifleman, and can send\r\nhis missile to a wonderful distance. Were I to be armed with the best\r\npistol hitherto invented, I should be sorry to fight an accomplished\r\nslinger, unless under cover.\r\n\r\nThe really tremendous power of the Sling is obtained by Centrifugal\r\nForce, the weapon, with its missile, being whirled in the air, and then\r\none string being loosed with a peculiar knack something like the “loose”\r\nof a good archer. In consequence, the centrifugal force is converted\r\ninto direct force, and the missile flies directly forwards.\r\n\r\nThe Amentum is simply a cord tied to a javelin, so that the thrower has\r\nthe advantage of a lever, which, after all, is only the conversion of\r\ncentrifugal force.\r\n\r\nThe very familiar Mop, flinging off its moisture to a considerable\r\ndistance, needs no description; but I have introduced it to show the\r\naction of centrifugal force in small as well as in great things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE next illustration shows how this very same power acts upon the\r\ngreatest as well as the least of objects, and enables them to maintain\r\npositions which otherwise they must of necessity fail to do. Take, for\r\nexample, our own Earth, and its peculiar position of being tilted on one\r\nside, so as to give us the alternative seasons as it flies on its annual\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThis is simply due to its own rapid revolution, which, on the same\r\nprinciple that keeps the arrow and the rifle-ball straight on their\r\ncourse, prevents it from altering its position.\r\n\r\nThe very same principle acts on the boys’ Tops, and is shown in a really\r\nremarkable manner by the professional Japanese top-spinners, who will\r\nplace several tops upon each other, as shown in the illustration, and\r\nmake them sway backwards and forwards in the most extraordinary manner,\r\nsometimes being all upright, and sometimes leaning almost at right\r\nangles to each other.\r\n\r\nA favourite mode of illustrating this power of Centrifugal Force is by\r\nthe Gyroscope, a figure of which is given on the right hand of the\r\nillustration. The interior wheel is made to revolve rapidly, and the\r\neffect of the revolution is to enable the instrument to maintain a\r\nhorizontal position, even when suspended on one side, as shown in the\r\nengraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REVOLUTION OF EARTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE TOPS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GYROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe power of this revolution is quite wonderful, even in a small\r\nGyroscope which can be purchased for a few shillings. It almost seems to\r\nbe alive, and to insist on retaining its position, in spite of all\r\nefforts to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThis principle is used in the swinging cabin of the Bessemer ship, and\r\nis also employed by quoit-players in keeping their missile steady as it\r\nflies towards the mark. Even the now fashionable Bicycle is managed on\r\nthe same principle.\r\n\r\nAs is well known to all bicycle riders, it is comparatively easy to\r\nmaintain the balance when the pace is rapid and the wheels revolving\r\nquickly. The difficulty is, to do so when the pace is slow, and the\r\nrider is deprived of the centrifugal force which keeps him on his\r\nbalance almost in spite of himself. It is just the same with a child’s\r\nhoop, which runs straight and upright when it is driven rapidly, or\r\nwhen, for example, it runs downhill. But, as soon as the centrifugal\r\nforce is expended, it begins to waver, loses its direction, and soon\r\nfalls to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nOSCILLATION.--UNITED STRENGTH.--THE DOME.\r\n\r\n     Connection of Oscillation with Centrifugal Force.--Equality of Time\r\n     in Oscillation.--The Spider.--The Stone and String.--Pendulum of\r\n     the Clock, and its Effect on the Machinery.--Acceleration and\r\n     Retardation.--Compensating Pendulums.--The Metronome, and its Use\r\n     in Music.--A simple Metronome.--Value of the Instrument in\r\n     War.--The Escapement, and its Connection with the Pendulum.--Mode\r\n     of Action.--Larva of Burying-beetle.--Earthworms and\r\n     Serpents.--Union is Strength.--The Hippopotamus Rope and its\r\n     Structure.--The Spider-web.--Distinction between the\r\n     Threads.--Principle of the Dome.--The Arch, and its Connection with\r\n     the Dome.--Esquimaux Huts.--Receiver of the Air-pump, and its Power\r\n     of Resistance.--The Human Skull and the Egg.--Accidental\r\n     Resemblance.--The Salad-dressing Bottle.--The Medusa, Strobila, and\r\n     Hydra.\r\n\r\n\r\nA portion of our last chapter dealt of Centrifugal Force. We will now\r\nproceed to another well-known power, which seems to be a variation, or\r\nperhaps a division, of the same power. I mean the principle of\r\nOSCILLATION, which has done so much for the present state of the world.\r\nI mention the connection of the two principles because it is evident\r\nthat, if Oscillation were continued in one direction, it would be\r\nconverted into centrifugal force. In fact, it can only be considered as\r\ncentrifugal force interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe chief point in this subject is the equal time occupied by the\r\noscillating body, no matter what may be the “arc” distance through which\r\nit sways, provided that the length of the line remains the same. The\r\ndiscovery of this principle by Galileo in a church at Florence is too\r\nwell known to need repetition.\r\n\r\nThis principle may be observed by any one, and at almost any time. The\r\nSpider at the end of its line illustrates it, and so does a stone tied\r\nto a string, both of which objects are shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN various departments of Art, Oscillation is absolutely invaluable. We\r\nwill take, for instance, the best known of these examples, namely, the\r\nPendulum, by which the movements of clocks are regulated. Without some\r\nmode of regulation, the works would run down rapidly, and the clock\r\nrendered incapable of measuring time. But, in the Pendulum, we possess a\r\nmeans of making a clock go at any desirable rate, and be faster and\r\nslower at pleasure; a long Pendulum working slowly, and a short one\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSCILLATING WEIGHT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METRONOME.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENDULUM.]\r\n\r\nHow the Pendulum affects the working of a clock may be seen by reference\r\nto the right-hand figure of the illustration. The movements of the clock\r\nare connected with the Pendulum by means of an ingenious piece of\r\nmechanism called an “escapement,” because it only allows the wheel shown\r\nin the illustration to move one cog at each swing of the Pendulum.\r\n\r\nNow, as in the latitude of London a pendulum which is a trifle more than\r\nthirty-nine inches in length swings once in a second, it is evident\r\nthat, by lengthening or shortening the Pendulum, we have the rate of the\r\nclock entirely under command.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a Pendulum be required to swing once in two seconds, it\r\nmust be four times as long as that which swings once in one second,\r\nwhile to swing once in three seconds it must be nine times as long, the\r\nlength being measured by the square of the time of vibration.\r\n\r\nWe are thus able to “regulate” clocks by lengthening the Pendulum if\r\nthey be too fast, and shortening them if they be too slow. The reader\r\nwill probably have remarked that the conditions of the atmosphere--such\r\nas heat, cold, moisture, or dryness--must have an effect on the length\r\nof the Pendulum, and thus alter the rating of the clock. So they do, and\r\nin consequence the Compensating Pendulums have been invented, some of\r\nthem being made of metallic rods of different powers of expansion,\r\nmostly brass and steel, while others carry a quantity of mercury in a\r\nglass tube near the bottom of the Pendulum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER familiar example of the Pendulum is the Metronome, which is\r\nsimply a Pendulum with a weight at the top as well as counterpoise below\r\nthe bottom, the weight moving up or down so as to decrease or hasten the\r\npace. Generally a bell is added to it, which is struck at the beginning\r\nof each bar.\r\n\r\nThe exactness of its beats is perfect, as is known to all musicians, and\r\nis calculated to take the conceit out of players who are apt to\r\ndisregard their time. I knew one lady, a really good pianiste, before\r\nwhom I placed my Metronome. Before she had played many bars she broke\r\ndown, exclaiming that the horrid bell always said “ting” in the wrong\r\nplace. However, she soon acknowledged the value of the instrument, and\r\nwas glad to use it.\r\n\r\nA very good Metronome may be made by fastening a bullet to the end of a\r\npiece of tape, and swinging it backwards and forwards, regulating the\r\ntape according to the time required. Such a Metronome is very portable,\r\nand extremely useful where the conveyance of the clockwork instrument\r\nwould be troublesome. Moreover, its beats can be seen by a great number\r\nof persons. I have often used it myself.\r\n\r\nSuch a Metronome is used in the army, in order to regulate the pace of\r\nthe soldier’s step, it being of the last importance that the pace should\r\nalways be the same. Otherwise it would be impossible to calculate the\r\ntime which ought to be consumed in marching a certain distance, and the\r\nmilitary calculations on which depends the success or failure of a\r\ncampaign would be wholly upset, half an hour too soon or too late\r\nmeaning failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPEMENT.\r\n\r\nAs we are on the subject of the pendulum and Escapement, we will say a\r\nfew words about the latter piece of mechanism. It is here given on a\r\nlarger scale than in the previous illustration, so that its action may\r\nbe more easily understood. Whether in watch or clock, the Escapement is\r\nexactly the same in principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARVA OF BURYING-BEETLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESCAPEMENT OF WATCH.]\r\n\r\nFirst there is the escapement wheel, the circumference of which is\r\nfurnished with a number of very deep cogs, varying as to the work which\r\nthey have to do. Then there comes the escapement itself, which swings on\r\nits pivot, and is regulated in its oscillations by the pendulum. As it\r\nswings backwards and forwards, it is evident that only one tooth of the\r\nwheel can “escape,” and only that in one direction.\r\n\r\nWe can reverse a steam-engine, but the man has yet to be found who can\r\nreverse a clock, _i.e._ enable it to continue going in the opposite\r\ndirection. The only mode would be to enable one set of cogs to flatten\r\nthemselves, so as to pass the escapement, and a second set to start up\r\nin exactly the opposite direction. Or perhaps there might be two\r\nparallel escapement wheels, capable of being connected or disconnected\r\nwith the clock at pleasure. As, however, a reverse movement is quite\r\nneedless, no such invention seems to have been made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand is seen an example of the same principle as shown in\r\nNature. It represents a larva or grub of the Burying-beetle. It has no\r\nlegs available for locomotion, and yet it can get along with tolerable\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when living in Wiltshire, I was much struck with this\r\nfact. There had been an epidemic among sheep, which killed them off so\r\nfast that the farmers would at last not even bury them, but took off the\r\nskins, and left the bodies to moulder as they best might.\r\n\r\nIt was very unpleasant for the farmers, but just the contrary for the\r\nBurying-beetles, which simply swarmed in the deserted carcasses. If one\r\nof them were tapped with a stick, hundreds of these larvæ came scuttling\r\nout, displaying an activity which was really remarkable in creatures\r\npractically legless.\r\n\r\nIn reality this movement is achieved by an apparatus very similar in its\r\naction to that of the escapement. The rings, or “segments,” of which the\r\nbody is composed, are furnished with rows of sharp points, arranged very\r\nlike the cogs of the escapement wheel. By alternately elongating and\r\ncontracting the body, these points catch against surrounding substances,\r\nand force the creature onwards, only allowing of movement in one\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader will remember that in an earlier part of this work it\r\nhas been mentioned that the various worms propel themselves by the same\r\nmeans. So do the Serpents, the edges of the scales serving the same\r\npurpose as the hairs of the worms and the hooks of the grub.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION IS STRENGTH.\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the accompanying illustration we have an example of\r\nthe wonderful power obtained by uniting together a number of\r\ncomparatively weak objects. It represents a portion of the rope attached\r\nto the harpoon with which the natives of some parts of Africa attack and\r\nkill the hippopotamus.\r\n\r\nConsidering that a full-grown hippopotamus weighs several tons, and, in\r\nspite of its enormous size, is as active as a tiger, we can infer the\r\nstrength of the rope which must be needed to hold such an animal when\r\nexcited with rage and pain.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the female hippopotamus at the Zoological Gardens, when\r\ndeprived of her cub, actually tried to leap over the lofty iron barrier,\r\nand so far succeeded as to throw her weight on the uppermost bar.\r\nFortunately it was made of well-wrought iron, and was only bent by her\r\nweight. Had it been made of cast-iron, like most railings, she would\r\nhave snapped it like glass.\r\n\r\nNow, the fibres of which the rope is composed are individually feeble,\r\nbut, when they lend their strength to each other, their strength is\r\namazing. It is well shown by a lasso in my possession, made of the\r\nfibres of the aloe-leaf. It is scarcely as thick as a man’s little\r\nfinger, and yet it is strong enough to resist the efforts of the most\r\npowerful wild bull. I have some of the separate fibres, and it is\r\ninteresting to notice how fibres so slight when separate should be so\r\nstrong when united. Part of the rope has been unlaid, so as to show the\r\nmanner in which it has been put together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIPPOPOTAMUS ROPE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINNERET OF SPIDER.]\r\n\r\nTowards the harpoon itself, a number of small cords laid loosely side by\r\nside are used, so as to prevent the hippopotamus from severing the rope\r\nwith his chisel-like teeth, which he would assuredly do if it were\r\nsingle. The multitudinous cords become entangled among the teeth, and\r\nbaffle his efforts; but still their unity is their strength; and, though\r\nthe animal may sever one or two of them, the others retain their hold\r\nuntil he dies under a shower of spears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the right-hand side of the illustration is the Spinneret of the\r\nordinary garden Spider, showing the many orifices from which the silken\r\nthreads emerge. It is a remarkable point, and one which, I believe, is\r\nseldom noticed, that the Spider can at pleasure combine all these fibres\r\ninto a single cord, or issue and keep them separate, just as is the case\r\nwith the hippopotamus rope.\r\n\r\nThe latter operation may be seen whenever a large fly gets into the web.\r\nThe Spider darts at it, bites it, and then, ejecting a loose mass of\r\nfibres, rolls it up in a moment, as in a shroud, carries it off and\r\nhangs it in a convenient place, and mends the broken meshes of the web.\r\nBut both kinds of the cords of the net are made differently from the\r\nwinding-up fibres, the former being fixed together, and the latter kept\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLE OF THE DOME.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with Domes, especially when the Dome of St. Paul’s\r\nis the most conspicuous object in our metropolis. Few persons, however,\r\nexcept professional architects and builders, seem to ask themselves the\r\nprinciple on which the Dome is constructed.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the arch is well known, and the Dome is practically a\r\nnumber of arches, affording material support to each other, and so\r\nenormously increasing the strength of the edifice.\r\n\r\nA good idea of the Dome principle may be formed by taking two croquet\r\nhoops, placing them at right angles to each other, tying them together\r\nat the intersection, and pushing the ends in the ground. Even by this\r\nvery simple arrangement considerable strength can be obtained; but, if\r\nthe hoops be sufficiently multiplied to form a close Dome, it will be\r\nevident that the strength will be correspondingly increased.\r\n\r\nSo strong, indeed, is the Dome, that it could be made without mortar or\r\ncement, although, of course, its strength is increased by their use. A\r\nvery good example of a Dome thus constructed is found in the “igloo,” or\r\nsnow-hut of the Esquimaux, which has already been described.\r\n\r\nAs to the example which I have selected, it would have been easy enough\r\nto have chosen one of the great Domes of the world, such as St. Peter’s\r\nat Rome, St. Maria del Fiore at Florence, St. Paul’s of London, or St.\r\nGeneviève or the Invalides of Paris.\r\n\r\nI have, however, selected the present example on account of the thinness\r\nof its walls, the fragility of its material, and the enormous pressure\r\nwhich it has to undergo. This is the “Receiver” of the Air-pump. It is\r\nmade of glass not thicker than an ordinary tumbler, and yet, even when\r\nexhausted of air, it will resist the pressure of the atmosphere for\r\ndays together.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that the Receiver is deprived of its internal air,\r\nand therefore has to resist a pressure equal to fifteen pounds on every\r\nsquare inch of its surface, it may be imagined how strong the Dome is.\r\nWere the top or either side to be flat, it would be crushed as soon as a\r\nvacuum was formed sufficient to deprive it of the support of the air\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA GLANCE at the illustration will show how the Receiver is modelled on\r\nthe same plan as the Human Skull, the outlines being curiously similar.\r\nIt is this formation which imparts such strength to so thin a set of\r\nbones as those which compose the human skull as enables them to protect\r\na sensitive organ like the brain, on which both reason and life itself\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUMAN SKULL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECEIVER OF AIR-PUMP.]\r\n\r\nEggs also form good examples of the wonderful strength obtained by this\r\nprinciple, their thin shells protecting the yolk and the white, as well\r\nas the chick through its progress to maturity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE last subject in this chapter is a curious example of an evidently\r\naccidental resemblance in form.\r\n\r\nThe figure on the right of the accompanying illustration will at once be\r\nrecognised as one of those Salad-dressing Bottles which try to conceal\r\nby their shape the small volume of their contents.\r\n\r\nThat on the left represents one of the many forms through which the\r\nMedusa passes before it attains its perfect form. It was long thought\r\nto be a separate creature, and was known under the scientific name of\r\nStrobila. Modern researches have, however, made the discovery that it is\r\none of the transitional stages between the creature known as the\r\nTrumpet-hydra (_Hydra tuba_) and the Medusa, popularly known as\r\nJelly-fish.\r\n\r\nThe former almost exactly resembles the Hydra of our fresh waters. It is\r\na tiny transparent gelatinous bag--so transparent as to be scarcely\r\nperceptible, and with some thirty or forty long and delicate tentacles\r\nhanging from its open end. These tentacles are used in catching the\r\nminute creatures on which it feeds. It is fixed, and, to use Mr. Rymer\r\nJones’s simile, looks like a beautiful silk-like pencil waving amidst\r\nthe water. Its length is not quite half an inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUMPET-HYDRA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALAD-DRESSING BOTTLE.]\r\n\r\nThat it should be identical with the remarkable form shown in the\r\nillustration seems impossible, but such is the case. Its body becomes\r\ncontracted as if tied with strings, and every segment thus formed\r\ndevelops a set of tentacles, breaks away, and swims off in the form of a\r\nMedusa. The upper segment is exhibited as undergoing this process.\r\n\r\nThe figure is magnified so as to show the structure better, its right\r\nlength being about one-third of an inch. A full and graphic history of\r\nthis creature and its manifold changes may be found in Mr. Rymer Jones’s\r\n“Aquarian Naturalist.”\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that the inventor of the Salad-dressing Bottle ever saw\r\na Hydra, but the resemblance is strangely exact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACOUSTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPERCUSSION.--THE STRING AND REED.--THE\r\nTRUMPET.--EAR-TRUMPET.--STETHOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n     The Science of Sound.--Rhythmical Vibrations.--The Drum.--Primitive\r\n     Drums.--The Solid and Hollow Log.--The Bass Drum and\r\n     Kettle-drum.--African Drums.--Gnostic Gems and the Ashanti\r\n     Drum.--Tympanum, or Drum of the Human Ear, and its Mechanism.--An\r\n     artificial Tympanum.--The String.--The Bow and the Harp.--The\r\n     Harpsichord and the Zither.--The Bow and the Violin.--The\r\n     Cricket.--The Vibrator, or Reed.--The Jew’s Harp and\r\n     Harmonium.--The Cicada and its Song.--Harmonics upon Strings.--The\r\n     Æolian Harp.--Harmonics upon the Trumpet.--The Trombone.--Trachea\r\n     of the Swan.--The Ear-trumpet.--The Sea-shell.--The\r\n     Stethoscope.--Savage Food.--The Aye-aye.--The Siren and its\r\n     Uses.--Echo and Whispering Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a work of this nature it would be absolutely impossible, not to say\r\nout of place, to give an account of so elaborate a subject as Acoustics,\r\n_i.e._ the science of Sound. Suffice it to say, that all sounds are\r\nproduced by the vibration of air, and that the fewer vibrations, the\r\nlower is the sound, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nWhen such vibrations are produced regularly, they form Musical sounds,\r\nbut, if irregularly, the sounds can be only distinguished under the term\r\nof Noise. The earliest germ of music lies in certain savage races, who,\r\nas long as they can maintain a rhythmical beat on any resonant\r\nsubstance, do not particularly care what it is. A hollow tree is a\r\nsplendid instrument in their opinion, but, if this cannot be had, a dry\r\nlog of wood will answer the same purpose.\r\n\r\nSome tribes, more ingenious than others, cut a deep groove upon the\r\nupper surface of a log, hollow it through this groove, and then hammer\r\naway at it to their hearts’ content. The next move was to cut off a\r\nsection of the trunk of a tree, hollow it, set it on end, and then beat\r\nit on the sides.\r\n\r\nLastly, some one hit upon the idea that if the open upper part of the\r\nhollowed log were covered with a tightly stretched membrane, and that if\r\nthe membrane, instead of the log, were beaten, the resonance would be\r\nincreased. In consequence, the real Drum was invented, and seems to have\r\nexisted from time immemorial in parts of the world so distant that they\r\ncould not have had any communication with each other.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the well-known “Bass Drum” of our bands, which is\r\nshown on the right hand of the figure. We make it a very ornamental\r\narticle, with frame of metal, and heraldic decorations of all kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBONES AND DRUM OF EAR.\r\n\r\n_a_ TUBE OF EAR.\r\n_b_ DRUM.\r\n_c_ HAMMER.\r\n_d_ ANVIL.\r\n_e_ STIRRUP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRUMS.]\r\n\r\nLying against it is one of a pair of Kettle-drums, such as are always\r\nseen in mounted bands. They look very easy to play, but, if the reader\r\nwill try a pair, he will soon find his mistake.\r\n\r\nBut there are savage tribes of Western Africa who make Drums of such\r\nwonderful power that their sullen roar is heard for miles around, as\r\ntheir slow, triple beat summons the tribe to arms like the fiery cross\r\nof the Highland clans. As to shape, lightness, and beauty, our Drums are\r\ninfinitely superior to theirs, but, so far as I can gather from personal\r\nand written narratives of African travellers, none of our Drums surpass\r\ntheirs in richness, depth of tone, and power of carrying sound.\r\n\r\nSometimes these Drums, instead of being mere cylinders, are carved into\r\nthe most strange and fantastical patterns. I possess one of these\r\ncurious Drums, brought from Ashanti, and carved out of a solid piece of\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe strange point in it is, that it represents a double head carrying,\r\nafter all negro fashions, a sort of vessel upon it. One part of the head\r\nrepresents a human head (not that of a negro), while the other merges\r\ngradually into an eagle’s head and beak. It is, in fact, a Gnostic gem,\r\nand would pass muster as such if it had been engraved on chalcedony,\r\ncornelian, or other semi-precious stones which are employed in the\r\nseal-engraver’s art.\r\n\r\nUpon this composite head is placed the Drum itself, which is also cut\r\nout of the solid block, and which, after the fashion of West African\r\nDrums, has a hole on one side.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable instrument was given to me by an old merchant captain,\r\nwho brought it himself from West Africa, and who, when I made his\r\nacquaintance, had actually painted it all kinds of colours, planted it\r\nin his garden, and was using the Drum as a flower-pot. Of course, as\r\nsoon as it came into my possession, I put it in “pickle,”--i.e. a strong\r\nsolution of alkali,--brushed off the paint, and placed it in my museum,\r\nwhere it is now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration on page 514 is given a sort of map\r\nor chart of the human Ear, with its internal Drum, or Tympanum, as it is\r\nscientifically termed.\r\n\r\nIt is by the vibration of this Drum that hearing is made possible, the\r\nvibrations of the air being transmitted to the Drum by means of a\r\nbeautiful bony apparatus, termed the Hammer, Anvil and Stirrup.\r\nSometimes the action of the Drum is partially checked, and then the\r\nsufferer is said to be “hard of hearing.” Sometimes it is broken, or its\r\naction totally clogged, and then he is said to be “stone deaf.” There\r\nhave been cases where an artificial tympanum has been inserted, and\r\nanswered its purpose fairly well.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRING AND REED.\r\n\r\nIt has previously been mentioned that all sounds are owing to vibrations\r\nof the air. But there are many ways of producing these vibrations, and\r\neach mode gives a different quality of tone. We have already seen, by\r\nmeans of the drum, how sound is produced by percussion. We shall now see\r\nhow sounds can be produced by the vibrations of a String.\r\n\r\nIf the string of a bow be pulled and smartly loosed, the result is a\r\ndistinctly musical sound, higher or lower according to the length and\r\ntension of the string. Perhaps some of my readers may recall the passage\r\nin Homer’s “Odyssey,” where Ulysses strings the fatal bow:--\r\n\r\n    “Heedless he heard them; but disdained reply,\r\n     The bow perusing with exactest eye.\r\n     Then, as some heavenly minstrel, taught to sing\r\n     High notes responsive to the trembling string,\r\n     To some new strain when he adapts the lyre,\r\n     Or the dumb lute refits with vocal wire,\r\n     Relaxes, strains, and draws them to and fro;\r\n     So the great master drew the mighty bow,\r\n     And drew with ease. One hand aloft displayed\r\n     The bending horns, and one the string essayed.\r\n     From his essaying hand the string let fly,\r\n     Twanged short and sharp, like the shrill swallow’s cry.”\r\n\r\nThe Harp is, in fact, nothing but a magnified bow, with a number of\r\nstrings of graduated length and tension. Some very beautiful experiments\r\nhave been made on this subject by the Rev. Sir F. A. G. Ouseley,\r\nProfessor of Music at Oxford, who stretched a string of sixty-four feet\r\nin length, and found that although, when vibrating, it must produce a\r\nnote, there was no human ear that could distinguish it. Yet, if combined\r\nwith other musical instruments, it would probably do its work well. The\r\ntheory of the vibrations will be briefly described on another page.\r\n\r\nThese vibrations may be produced in various manners. The string may be\r\npulled with the fingers, as in the harp, the guitar, the zither, or even\r\nthe violin, &c., in pizzicato passages.\r\n\r\nThe old harpsichord, now an instrument vanished into the shadows of the\r\npast, pulled the strings with little strips of quill, acting like the\r\nthumb-ring of the zither-player. The “plectrum” of the ancients acted in\r\nthe same manner, and the Japanese have at the present day a sort of\r\nguitar played with a plectrum. I have heard it, but cannot particularly\r\nadmire the effect, the notes appearing to be without feeling, and as if\r\nthey were played on a barrel-organ.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as in our modern pianos, the strings are struck by hammers\r\ninstead of being pulled by fingers, plectrum, or goose-quill.\r\n\r\nThe most ingenious mode of causing musical vibration is the Bow, which\r\nis too familiar to need a detailed description. Suffice it to say that\r\nit really is a modified bow, the place of the string being supplied by a\r\nflat band of horsehair, which is drawn over the string, and so causes it\r\nto vibrate. In order to enable the bow to grip the string, it is rubbed\r\nwith resin almost as often as a billiard-player chalks his cue.\r\n\r\nSome skill is required even in producing a sound by the bow. It looks as\r\nif any one could do it, but a novice, if he extorts any sound at all,\r\nnever rises above a squeak. When I took my first violin lessons, nearly\r\nthirty years ago, I was so horrified at the discordant sounds elicited\r\nfrom the instrument, that I retired to the topmost garret of the house\r\nin order not to hurt any one’s feelings except my own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRICKET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CICADA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIOLIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEW’S HARP.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration is seen a well-known example of the\r\nimitation of Nature by Art. This is the common Cricket, whose loud\r\nshrill call is more familiar than agreeable.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, while engaged on my “Insects at Home,” I gave much time\r\nto the examination of the structures by which such a sound can be\r\nproduced. On the under side of the wing-covers, or “elytra,” as they are\r\nscientifically termed, are notched ridges, which, when examined with a\r\nmoderate power of the microscope, have something of this appearance\r\n~~~~~~~. The friction of these notches produces the musical sound,\r\nwhich, as the reader will see, is exactly analogous to the friction of\r\nthe bow upon the string.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEXT we come to the Vibrator, sometimes called the Reed. It is\r\nintroduced into various musical instruments, such, for example, as the\r\nharmonium, the clarionet, the oboe, the bassoon, and various organ\r\npipes.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of the Vibrator is shown in the Jew’s Harp, as it is\r\npopularly called, though it is not a harp, and has nothing to do with\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIBRATING STRINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ÆOLIAN HARP.]\r\n\r\nThe word is really a mistaken pronunciation of “jaw’s harp,” because the\r\ninstrument is held against the teeth, while its tongue is vibrated by\r\nstrokes of the finger. These vibrations affect the air within the mouth,\r\nand, by expanding or contracting the mouth, the sound is lowered or\r\nraised according to the laws of Acoustics. Of course, the range of notes\r\nis very small, being limited to those of the common chord, and even they\r\nbeing attainable only by a practised performer. Very good effects,\r\nhowever, have been produced by means of a series of Jew’s Harps, set to\r\ndifferent tones by loading the end of the tongue with sealing-wax or\r\nsimilar substances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAN apparatus constructed on the same principle is to be found in the\r\nvocal organs of the male Cicada. If one of these insects be examined on\r\nthe lower surface, two curious and nearly circular flaps will be seen,\r\njust at the junction of the thorax with the abdomen. It is by the action\r\nof these two little vibrators that the insect is able to produce a sound\r\nso loud, that in calm weather it may be heard at the distance of a mile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE accompanying illustration is, in fact, a sort of chart as to the\r\nvibration of sound.\r\n\r\nOn the right is shown the ÆOLIAN HARP, with its upper lid raised, so as\r\nto show the structure of the strings. These are all tuned to the same\r\nnote, the present D being generally accepted as being most free from\r\nfalse tuning, and less liable for the errors of “temperament.” Several\r\nof the strings are an octave lower than the others, but the tonic is\r\nalways the same.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is placed in a current of air, generally in a window,\r\nwith the sash let down upon it, and the air-currents set the strings\r\nvibrating in a most wonderful manner.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for human fingers to touch them, but they automatically\r\ndivide themselves into the component parts of the common chord, and\r\nproduce octaves, fifths, and thirds _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the same illustration is exhibited a string of the\r\nsame length and tension, vibrating in two different ways. The upper\r\nfigure shows it divided into three portions, each of which gives the\r\nfifth above the tonic, and all of which, when sounding simultaneously,\r\ngive a fulness and richness to the tone which could only be attained\r\notherwise by three distinct instruments. All players of stringed\r\ninstruments know how invaluable are these harmonics, without which many\r\npassages of well-known music could not be played, and which are produced\r\nby “damping,” and not pressing the strings.\r\n\r\nSo, if the string be lightly touched, or damped at the crossing portion\r\nat either end, the result will be that the string divides itself into\r\nthree portions, and all three resound simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe lower string is vibrating in thirds, having divided itself into four\r\nportions. If it were damped in the middle, it would divide itself into\r\ntwo portions, and sound octaves.\r\n\r\nThe subject is a most interesting one, but our space is nearly\r\nexhausted, and we must pass to another branch of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN all brass instruments furnished with a mouthpiece, and not with a\r\nreed, the notes are obtained by vibrations of the enclosed air, caused\r\nby the movement of the lips. They are all set to some definite tonic,\r\nsometimes C natural, but mostly to a flat tone, such as B flat or E\r\nflat.\r\n\r\nTaking the ordinary military trumpet or bugle as an example, we have\r\n(when we have learned how to play it), first, the tonic. By alteration\r\nof the lips we get the octave above the tonic. Then comes the fifth;\r\nthen the third, which is, in fact, another octave; and then a few other\r\nnotes, the truth of which depends on the ear of the player.\r\n\r\nNow, all these notes are obtained by means of the lips, which set the\r\ncolumn of air vibrating, and divide it into harmonics. The apparently\r\ncomplicated bugle-calls of the army are nearly all formed from four\r\nnotes only, _i.e._ (taking C as the tonic) C G C E G.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRACHEA OF SWAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TROMBONE.]\r\n\r\nThe Trombone, which is shown on the right hand of the illustration, has\r\nthe advantage of being lengthened at will, and thus giving the performer\r\na fresh tonic, and consequently another series of harmonics. Valved and\r\nkeyed instruments have a similar advantage, the one acting by\r\nlengthening, and the other by shortening, the column of air. The former\r\nis infinitely the better plan, as it sets more harmonics vibrating, and\r\nconsequently gives a greater richness of tone.\r\n\r\nA familiar example of this is to be found in the Ophicleide and\r\nEuphonium. The former is eight feet in total length, and alters its\r\ntonic by eleven keys, which shorten the column of air. The latter is of\r\nthe same length, but, by the employment of valves, can be made sixteen\r\nfeet in length. Consequently the euphonium has practically killed the\r\nophicleide, just as the ophicleide killed the serpent. The\r\ncornet-à-pistons, the brass contra-basso, the flugel horn, the tenor\r\nsax-horn, &c., are all constructed on the same principle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand of the illustration is shown the wonderful apparatus by\r\nmeans of which the Swan produces its far-resounding cry. The windpipe,\r\nor “trachea,” as it is technically named, passes down the neck,\r\nprotected by the bones, until it reaches the chest. There it leaves\r\nthem, enters the cavity of the chest, and contorts itself in such a\r\nmanner as to obtain greater length, just as is the case with the\r\ntrombone and valved instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nACOUSTICS AS AIDS TO SURGERY.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the air-vibrations poured in at the small end\r\nof the trumpet can make resonant notes. We have now to see how the\r\nreverse process can be employed, and sounds poured into the larger end\r\nbe conveyed to the ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAR-TRUMPET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONCHA OF HUMAN EAR.]\r\n\r\nThe Ear-trumpet is a familiar example of such an instrument, and, as it\r\nis shown in the illustration, there is no need of further description.\r\nIt is rather remarkable, by the way, that the length of tube does not\r\nseem to interfere with the conveyance of sound, as may be seen by the\r\nspeaking-tubes which are now so common in private houses, hotels, and\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nI know of one church in which there is a special seat for deaf persons.\r\nThe reading-desk and pulpit are both fitted with the large ends of\r\nEar-trumpets. From them pass tubes under the flooring, and so into the\r\nseat, where they can be applied to the ear of the deaf worshippers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the right hand is the “Concha,” as it is called, of the human ear,\r\nwhich is evidently constructed for the purpose of collecting and\r\nconcentrating sounds. Instinctively, if we wish to near any sound more\r\ndistinctly, we place the open hand behind the ear, so as to enlarge its\r\nreceptive capacity, and send a greater volume of sound into the ear.\r\n\r\nThe well-known experiment of holding a shell to the ear so as to hear\r\nthe murmur of the sea is due to the same cause, the shell collecting,\r\nthough in a mixed manner, all the surrounding sounds, and making a\r\nmurmur which really resembles the distant wash of the waves upon the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAVAGE TAPPING TREE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURGEON USING STETHOSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThen, if we examine the various animals which need acute hearing, either\r\nto seize prey or escape from enemies, we shall find that they have large\r\nand mobile ears, which can be directed so as to catch the expected\r\nsound. The hare, rabbit, and deer are examples of the latter, while the\r\nformer are well represented by the domestic cat, whose ears are always\r\npricked forward when she hears the scratchings of a mouse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANOTHER most useful appliance is the STETHOSCOPE, which enables the\r\nskilful surgeon to investigate the interior of the body almost as\r\nclearly as if it were transparent. It is perfectly simple, being nothing\r\nbut a trumpet-shaped piece of wood, formed as shown in the illustration.\r\nSometimes it is hollow, and sometimes solid, but the result is the\r\nsame, sound being transmitted through wood in a most remarkable manner.\r\n\r\nFor example, if one end of the longest scaffolding pole be slightly\r\nscratched with a pin, the sound will be distinctly heard by any one who\r\nplaces his ear against the other end, though the person who uses the pin\r\ncan scarcely hear the sound himself. The surgeon, therefore, places the\r\nbroad end of the Stethoscope upon the patient, and the other upon his\r\near, taps more or less lightly with his fingers, and by the sounds\r\ntransmitted through the Stethoscope ascertains the condition of the\r\ninternal organs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON the left hand is an illustration of the mode in which the Australian\r\nsavage, without the least idea of the theory of Acoustics, utilises the\r\nsound-conducting power of wood. If he wishes to know whether or not a\r\nhollow tree is tenanted by an animal of which he is in pursuit, he\r\nplaces his ear against the tree, taps it smartly with his tomahawk, and\r\nlistens for the movement of the animal inside.\r\n\r\nSo delicate is this test, that it is employed even when the native is\r\nhunting for the large beetle-grubs on which they feed, and which are\r\naccounted a luxury even by Europeans, when they have once overcome the\r\nprejudice attaching itself to eating, without cookery, fat white grubs\r\nas thick and long as a man’s finger.\r\n\r\nThe Aye-aye is said to eat in exactly the same manner, tapping with its\r\nlong finger the trunks and branches of trees and, if it hears a maggot\r\ninside, gnawing it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT OF SOUND.\r\n\r\nOf late years we have had an instrument which enables us to measure the\r\nvibrations of sound as accurately as the barometer measures the weight\r\nof the atmosphere, the thermometer the temperature, and the photometer\r\nthe power of light. This is the Siren, which is shown on the right hand\r\nof the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\nTo explain this instrument fully would require ten times the space which\r\nwe have at command, and necessitate a great number of drawings. I will,\r\ntherefore, endeavour to explain its principle in as brief terms as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that at the lower part of the instrument there\r\nis a disc pierced with a number of holes, and that above these are two\r\ndials. Below the perforated disc, and therefore unseen, is a circular\r\nplate, also pierced with holes. When a pipe is attached to the lower\r\npart of the instrument, and air propelled through it, the disc begins to\r\nrevolve, every revolution being recorded by the dials, after the fashion\r\nof the ordinary gas-meter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GNAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUMBLE-BEE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIREN.]\r\n\r\nAs the pressure is increased, the air, passing through the holes,\r\nassumes a rhythmical beat, which soon becomes metamorphosed into musical\r\nnotes. It is evident, therefore, that, by means of this instrument, the\r\nnumber of vibrations which produce a definite tone can be measured with\r\nabsolute accuracy by any one who has an ear capable of appreciating a\r\nmusical note.\r\n\r\nIt is by means of the Siren that the much-disputed tonic of C will be\r\nsettled, the Continental and the English C being greatly at variance,\r\nand even the English C having been advanced almost a tone since the time\r\nof Handel. Much is it to be wished that Italy, the home of song, and\r\nEngland, the patron of song, could unite in their tonic, instead of\r\nhaving systems so widely different that an Italian singer is at a loss\r\nwith the English pitch, as is an English singer with the Italian pitch.\r\n\r\nThe Siren is even brought into the service of entomologists, enabling\r\nthem to measure by the sound the rapidity with which a flying insect\r\nmoves its wings. By means of this instrument we know the origin of the\r\nsharp, piercing “ping” of the Gnat, and the heavy, dull boom of the\r\nHumble-bee, both of which insects are given in the illustration.\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of this subject, I may mention that the instrument\r\nis called the Siren because it sings as well under water as in the air,\r\nprovided that water instead of air be driven through it.\r\n\r\n\r\nECHO.\r\n\r\nOur last page will be given to the phenomenon called by the name of\r\nECHO, which consists in the power of solid substances, whether natural\r\nor artificial, of reflecting the waves of sound thrown against them,\r\njust as a mirror reflects the waves of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHISPERING GALLERY.]\r\n\r\nVery often the Echo is naturally formed, as shown in the illustration,\r\nby rocks which cast back the sound--waves thrown against them. This is\r\nthe case in several parts of Dovedale in Derbyshire, where a pistol shot\r\nis reverberated backwards and forwards in a most wonderful manner, and a\r\ntrumpet blast repeats itself over and over again.\r\n\r\nAt Walton Hall, the residence of the late C. Waterton, Esq., there is a\r\nwonderful Echo, nearly half a mile from the house. Mr. Waterton had\r\ndiscovered the Echo, which proceeded from the walls of the house, and,\r\nhaving found its focus, placed on it a large stone, called the\r\nEcho-stone. Any one sitting on this stone, and singing, speaking, or\r\nwhistling towards the house, heard every sound repeated, as if in\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Whispering Gallery in St. Paul’s Cathedral is nothing but\r\nan ordinary Echo, though so intensified by the process of radiation,\r\nthat the sound is transmitted from one side of the dome to the other,\r\njust as light or heat is reflected from concave mirrors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAard-vark, 182, 227\r\n\r\nAbattis, 109\r\n\r\nAcaleph, 15\r\n\r\nAcorn Barnacles, 90\r\n\r\nAcoustics, 513\r\n\r\nAcrida
