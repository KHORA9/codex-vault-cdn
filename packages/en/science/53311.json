A man will often look at them,\r\n  and be tempted to go on, when he would have been frightened at\r\n  books of a larger size, and of a more erudite appearance._”—DR.\r\n  JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of the Family Library feel themselves stimulated to\r\nincreased exertions by the distinguished favour with which it has\r\nalready been received.\r\n\r\nThe volumes now before the public may be confidently appealed to as\r\nproofs of zeal on the part of the publishers to present to their\r\nreaders a series of productions, which, as they are connected, not with\r\nephemeral, but with permanent subjects, may, years hence as well as\r\nnow, be consulted for lively amusement as well as solid instruction.\r\n\r\nTo render this Library still more worthy of patronage, the proprietors\r\npropose incorporating in it such works of interest and value as may\r\nappear in the various Libraries and Miscellanies now preparing in\r\nEurope, particularly “Constable’s Miscellany,” the “Edinburgh Cabinet”\r\nLibrary, &c. All these productions, as they emanate from the press,\r\nwill be submitted to literary gentlemen for inspection; and none will\r\nbe reprinted but such as shall be found calculated to sustain the\r\nexalted character which this Library has already acquired.\r\n\r\nSeveral well-known authors have been engaged to prepare for it original\r\nworks of an American character, on History, Biography, Travels, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nEvery distinct subject will in general be comprehended in one volume,\r\nor at most in three volumes, which may form either a portion of\r\nthe series or a complete work by itself; and each volume will be\r\nembellished with appropriate engravings.\r\n\r\nThe entire series will be the production of authors of eminence, who\r\nhave acquired celebrity by their literary labours, and whose names,\r\nas they appear in succession, will afford the surest guarantee to\r\nthe public for the satisfactory manner in which the subjects will be\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nSuch is the plan by which it is intended to form an _American Family\r\nLibrary_, comprising all that is valuable in those branches of\r\nknowledge which most happily unite entertainment with instruction. The\r\nutmost care will be taken, not only to exclude whatever can have an\r\ninjurious influence on the mind, but to embrace every thing calculated\r\nto strengthen the best and most salutary impressions.\r\n\r\nWith these arrangements and facilities, the publishers flatter\r\nthemselves that they shall be able to present to their fellow-citizens\r\na work of unparalleled merit and cheapness, embracing subjects adapted\r\nto all classes of readers, and forming a body of literature deserving\r\nthe praise of having instructed many, and amused all; and above every\r\nother species of eulogy, of being fit to be introduced, without reserve\r\nor exception, by the father of a family to the domestic circle.\r\nMeanwhile, the very low price at which it is charged renders more\r\nextensive patronage necessary for its support and prosecution. The\r\n_immediate_ encouragement, therefore, of those who approve its plan\r\nand execution is respectfully solicited. The work may be obtained in\r\ncomplete sets, or in separate numbers, from the principal booksellers\r\nthroughout the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF THE FAMILY LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n“The publishers have hitherto fully deserved their daily increasing\r\nreputation by the good taste and judgment which have influenced the\r\nselections of works for the Family Library.”—_Albany Daily Advertiser._\r\n\r\n“The Family Library—A title which, from the valuable and entertaining\r\nmatter the collection contains, as well as from the careful style of\r\nits execution, it well deserves. No family, indeed, in which there\r\nare children to be brought up, ought to be without this Library, as\r\nit furnishes the readiest resources for that education which ought to\r\naccompany or succeed that of the boarding-school or the academy, and\r\nis infinitely more conducive than either to the cultivation of the\r\nintellect.”—_Monthly Review._\r\n\r\n“It is the duty of every person having a family to put this excellent\r\nLibrary into the hands of his children.”—_N. Y. Mercantile Advertiser._\r\n\r\n“It is one of the recommendations of the Family Library, that it\r\nembraces a large circle of interesting matter, of important information\r\nand agreeable entertainment, in a concise manner and a cheap form. It\r\nis eminently calculated for a popular series—published at a price so\r\nlow, that persons of the most moderate income may purchase it—combining\r\na matter and a style that the most ordinary mind may comprehend it, at\r\nthe same time that it is calculated to raise the moral and intellectual\r\ncharacter of the people.”—_Constellation._\r\n\r\n“We have repeatedly borne testimony to the utility of this work. It\r\nis one of the best that has ever been issued from the American press,\r\nand should be in the library of every family desirous of treasuring up\r\nuseful knowledge.”—_Boston Statesman._\r\n\r\n“We venture the assertion that there is no publication in the country\r\nmore suitably adapted to the taste and requirements of the great mass\r\nof community, or better calculated to raise the intellectual character\r\nof the middling classes of society, than the Family Library.”—_Boston\r\nMasonic Mirror._\r\n\r\n“We have so often recommended this enterprising and useful publication\r\n(the Family Library), that we can here only add, that each successive\r\nnumber appears to confirm its merited popularity.”—_N. Y. American._\r\n\r\n“The little volumes of this series truly comport with their title, and\r\nare in themselves a Family Library.”—_N. Y. Commercial Advertiser._\r\n\r\n“We recommend the whole set of the Family Library as one of the\r\ncheapest means of affording pleasing instruction, and imparting a\r\nproper pride in books, with which we are acquainted.”—_U. S. Gazette._\r\n\r\n“It will prove instructing and amusing to all classes. We are pleased\r\nto learn that the works comprising this Library have become, as they\r\nought to be, quite popular among the heads of families.”—_N. Y.\r\nGazette._\r\n\r\n“The Family Library is, what its name implies, a collection of\r\nvarious original works of the best kind, containing reading useful\r\nand interesting to the family circle. It is neatly printed, and\r\nshould be in every family that can afford it—the price being\r\nmoderate.”—_New-England Palladium._\r\n\r\n“We are pleased to see that the publishers have obtained sufficient\r\nencouragement to continue their valuable Family Library.”—_Baltimore\r\nRepublican._\r\n\r\n“The Family Library presents, in a compendious and convenient form,\r\nwell-written histories of popular men, kingdoms, sciences, &c.\r\narranged and edited by able writers, and drawn entirely from the\r\nmost correct and accredited authorities. It is, as it professes to\r\nbe, a Family Library, from which, at little expense, a household may\r\nprepare themselves for a consideration of those elementary subjects of\r\neducation and society, without a due acquaintance with which neither\r\nman nor woman has claim to be well bred, or to take their proper place\r\namong those with whom they abide.”—_Charleston Gazette._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOY’S AND GIRL’S LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPECTUS.\r\n\r\nThe Publishers of the “BOY’S AND GIRL’S LIBRARY” propose, under this\r\ntitle, to issue a series of cheap but attractive volumes, designed\r\nespecially for the young. The undertaking originates not in the\r\nimpression that there does not already exist in the treasures of the\r\nreading world a large provision for this class of the community.\r\nThey are fully aware of the deep interest excited at the present day\r\non the subject of the mental and moral training of the young, and\r\nof the amount of talent and labour bestowed upon the production of\r\nworks aiming both at the solid culture and the innocent entertainment\r\nof the inquisitive minds of children. They would not therefore have\r\ntheir projected enterprise construed into an implication of the\r\nslightest disparagement of the merits of their predecessors in the same\r\ndepartment. Indeed it is to the fact of the _growing abundance_ rather\r\nthan to the _scarcity_ of useful productions of this description that\r\nthe design of the present work is to be traced; as they are desirous\r\nof creating a channel through which the products of the many able pens\r\nenlisted in the service of the young may be advantageously conveyed to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nThe contemplated course of publications will more especially embrace\r\nsuch works as are adapted, not to the extremes of early childhood or\r\nof advanced youth, but to that intermediate space which lies between\r\nchildhood and the opening of maturity, when the trifles of the nursery\r\nand the simple lessons of the school-room have ceased to exercise their\r\nbeneficial influence, but before the taste for a higher order of mental\r\npleasure has established a fixed ascendency in their stead. In the\r\nselection of works intended for the rising generation in this plastic\r\nperiod of their existence, when the elements of future character are\r\nreceiving their moulding impress, the Publishers pledge themselves that\r\nthe utmost care and scrupulosity shall be exercised. They are fixed\r\nin their determination that nothing of a questionable tendency on the\r\nscore of sentiment shall find admission into pages consecrated to the\r\nholy purpose of instructing the thoughts, regulating the passions, and\r\nsettling the principles of the young.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the Publishers of the “Boy’s and Girl’s Library” would assure\r\nthe Public that an adequate patronage alone is wanting to induce and\r\nenable them to secure the services of the most gifted pens in our\r\ncountry in the proposed publication, and thus to render it altogether\r\nworthy of the age and the object which calls it forth, and of the\r\ncountenance which they solicit for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    SIR.

But\r\neven if this personal obligation had been less powerful, those literary\r\nattainments and that enlightened benevolence which reflect upon rank\r\nits highest lustre would have justified me in seeking for it the\r\npatronage of a name which they have so justly honoured.\r\n\r\n            DAVID BREWSTER.\r\n\r\n_Allerly, June 1st, 1831._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this is the only Life of Sir Isaac Newton on any considerable scale\r\nthat has yet appeared, I have experienced great difficulty in preparing\r\nit for the public. The materials collected by preceding biographers\r\nwere extremely scanty; the particulars of his early life, and even\r\nthe historical details of his discoveries, have been less perfectly\r\npreserved than those of his illustrious predecessors; and it is not\r\ncreditable to his disciples that they have allowed a whole century to\r\nelapse without any suitable record of the life and labours of a master\r\nwho united every claim to their affection and gratitude.\r\n\r\nIn drawing up this volume, I have obtained much assistance from the\r\naccount of Sir Isaac Newton in the Biographia Britannica; from the\r\nletters to Oldenburg, and other papers in Bishop Horsley’s edition\r\nof his works; from Turnor’s Collections for the History of the Town\r\nand Soke of Grantham; from M. Biot’s excellent Life of Newton in the\r\nBiographie Universelle; and from Lord King’s Life and Correspondence of\r\nLocke.\r\n\r\nAlthough these works contain much important information respecting the\r\nLife of Newton, yet I have been so fortunate as to obtain many new\r\nmaterials of considerable value.\r\n\r\nTo the kindness of Lord Braybrooke I have been indebted for the\r\ninteresting correspondence of Newton, Mr. Pepys, and Mr. Millington,\r\nwhich is now published for the first time, and which throws much light\r\nupon an event in the life of our author that has recently acquired an\r\nunexpected and a painful importance. These letters, when combined with\r\nthose which passed between Newton and Locke, and with a curious extract\r\nfrom the manuscript diary of Mr. Abraham Pryme, kindly furnished to\r\nme by his collateral descendant Professor Pryme of Cambridge, fill up\r\na blank in his history, and have enabled me to delineate in its true\r\ncharacter that temporary indisposition which, from the view that has\r\nbeen taken of it by foreign philosophers, has been the occasion of such\r\ndeep distress to the friends of science and religion.\r\n\r\nTo Professor Whewell, of Cambridge, I owe very great obligations for\r\nmuch valuable information. Professor Rigaud, of Oxford, to whose\r\nkindness I have on many other occasions been indebted, supplied me with\r\nseveral important facts, and with extracts from the diary of Hearne\r\nin the Bodleian Library, and from the original correspondence between\r\nNewton and Flamstead, which the president of Corpus Christi College\r\nhad for this purpose committed to his care; and Dr. J. C. Gregory, of\r\nEdinburgh, the descendant of the illustrious inventor of the reflecting\r\ntelescope, allowed me to use his unpublished account of an autograph\r\nmanuscript of Sir Isaac Newton, which was found among the papers of\r\nDavid Gregory, Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, and which\r\nthrows some light on the history of the Principia.\r\n\r\nI have been indebted to many other friends for the communication of\r\nbooks and facts, but especially to Sir William Hamilton, Bart., whose\r\nliberality in promoting literary inquiry is not limited to the circle\r\nof his friends.\r\n\r\n            D. B.\r\n\r\n_Allerly, June 1st, 1831._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    Page\r\n  CHAPTER

The philosopher,[1]\r\nindeed, to whom posterity will probably assign the place next to\r\nNewton, has characterized the _Principia_ as pre-eminent above all the\r\nproductions of human intellect, and has thus divested of extravagance\r\nthe contemporary encomium upon its author,\r\n\r\n    Nec fas est propius mortali attingere Divos.\r\n                                             HALLEY.\r\n\r\n    So near the gods—man cannot nearer go.\r\n\r\nThe biography of an individual so highly renowned cannot fail to excite\r\na general interest. Though his course may have lain in the vale of\r\nprivate life, and may have been unmarked with those dramatic events\r\nwhich throw a lustre even round perishable names, yet the inquiring\r\nspirit will explore the history of a mind so richly endowed,—will study\r\nits intellectual and moral phases, and will seek the shelter of its\r\nauthority on those great questions which reason has abandoned to faith\r\nand hope.\r\n\r\nIf the conduct and opinions of men of ordinary talent are recorded for\r\nour instruction, how interesting must it be to follow the most exalted\r\ngenius through the incidents of common life;—to mark the steps by\r\nwhich he attained his lofty pre-eminence; to see how he performs the\r\nfunctions of the social and the domestic compact; how he exercises his\r\nlofty powers of invention and discovery; how he comports himself in the\r\narena of intellectual strife; and in what sentiments, and with what\r\naspirations he quits the world which he has adorned.\r\n\r\nIn almost all these bearings, the life and writings of Sir Isaac Newton\r\nabound with the richest counsel. Here the philosopher will learn the\r\nart by which alone he can acquire an immortal name. The moralist will\r\ntrace the lineaments of a character adjusted to all the symmetry of\r\nwhich our imperfect nature is susceptible; and the Christian will\r\ncontemplate with delight the high-priest of science quitting the study\r\nof the material universe,—the scene of his intellectual triumphs,—to\r\ninvestigate with humility and patience the mysteries of his faith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton was born at Woolsthorpe, a hamlet in the parish of\r\nColsterworth, in Lincolnshire, about six miles south of Grantham,\r\non the 25th December, O. S., 1642, exactly one year after Galileo\r\ndied, and was baptized at Colsterworth on the 1st January, 1642–3.\r\nHis father, Mr. Isaac Newton, died at the early age of thirty-six, a\r\nlittle more than a year after the death of his father Robert Newton,\r\nand only a few months after his marriage to Harriet Ayscough, daughter\r\nof James Ayscough of Market Overton in Rutlandshire. This lady was\r\naccordingly left in a state of pregnancy, and appears to have given\r\na premature birth to her only and posthumous child. The helpless\r\ninfant thus ushered into the world was of such an extremely diminutive\r\nsize,[2] and seemed of so perishable a frame, that two women who were\r\nsent to Lady Pakenham’s at North Witham, to bring some medicine to\r\nstrengthen him, did not expect to find him alive on their return.\r\nProvidence, however, had otherwise decreed; and that frail tenement\r\nwhich seemed scarcely able to imprison its immortal mind was destined\r\nto enjoy a vigorous maturity, and to survive even the average term\r\nof human existence. The estate of Woolsthorpe, in the manor-house of\r\nwhich this remarkable birth took place, had been more than a hundred\r\nyears in the possession of the family, who came originally from Newton\r\nin Lancashire, but who had, previous to the purchase of Woolsthorpe,\r\nsettled at Westby, in the county of Lincoln. The manor-house, of which\r\nwe have given an engraving, is situated in a beautiful little valley,\r\nremarkable for its copious wells of pure spring water, on the west side\r\nof the river Witham, which has its origin in the neighbourhood, and\r\ncommands an agreeable prospect to the east towards Colsterworth. The\r\nmanor of Woolsthorpe was worth only 30_l._ per annum; but Mrs. Newton\r\npossessed another small estate at Sewstern,[3] which raised the annual\r\nvalue of their property to about 80_l._; and it is probable that the\r\ncultivation of the little farm on which she resided somewhat enlarged\r\nthe limited income upon which she had to support herself, and educate\r\nher child.\r\n\r\nFor three years Mrs. Newton continued to watch over her tender charge\r\nwith parental anxiety; but in consequence of her marriage to the\r\nReverend Barnabas Smith, rector of North Witham, about a mile south\r\nof Woolsthorpe, she left him under the care of her own mother. At the\r\nusual age he was sent to two day-schools at Skillington and Stoke,\r\nwhere he acquired the education which such seminaries afforded; but\r\nwhen he reached his twelfth year he went to the public school at\r\nGrantham, taught by Mr. Stokes, and was boarded at the house of Mr.\r\nClark, an apothecary in that town. According to information which\r\nSir Isaac himself gave to Mr. Conduit, he seems to have been very\r\ninattentive to his studies, and very low in the school. The boy,\r\nhowever, who was above him, having one day given him a severe kick\r\nupon his stomach, from which he suffered great pain, Isaac laboured\r\nincessantly till he got above him in the school, and from that time\r\nhe continued to rise till he was the head boy. From the habits of\r\napplication which this incident had led him to form, the peculiar\r\ncharacter of his mind was speedily displayed. During the hours of\r\nplay, when the other boys were occupied with their amusements, his\r\nmind was engrossed with mechanical contrivances, either in imitation\r\nof something which he had seen, or in execution of some original\r\nconception of his own. For this purpose he provided himself with little\r\nsaws, hatchets, hammers, and all sorts of tools, which he acquired the\r\nart of using with singular dexterity. The principal pieces of mechanism\r\nwhich he thus constructed were a windmill, a waterclock, and a carriage\r\nput in motion by the person who sat in it. When a windmill was erecting\r\nnear Grantham on the road to Gunnerby, Isaac frequently attended the\r\noperations of the workmen, and acquired such a thorough knowledge of\r\nthe machinery that he completed a working model of it, which excited\r\nuniversal admiration. This model was frequently placed on the top of\r\nthe house in which he lodged at Grantham, and was put in motion by\r\nthe action of the wind upon its sails. Not content with this exact\r\nimitation of the original machine, he conceived the idea of driving it\r\nby animal power, and for this purpose he enclosed in it a mouse which\r\nhe called the miller, and which, by acting upon a sort of treadwheel,\r\ngave motion to the machine. According to some accounts, the mouse was\r\nmade to advance by pulling a string attached to its tail, while others\r\nallege that the power of the little agent was called forth by its\r\nunavailing attempts to reach a portion of corn placed above the wheel.\r\n\r\nHis waterclock was formed out of a box which he had solicited from Mrs.\r\nClark’s brother. It was about four feet high, and of a proportional\r\nbreadth, somewhat like a common houseclock. The index of the dialplate\r\nwas turned by a piece of wood, which either fell or rose by the action\r\nof dropping water. As it stood in his own bedroom he supplied it every\r\nmorning with the requisite quantity of water, and it was used as a\r\nclock by Mr. Clark’s family, and remained in the house long after its\r\ninventor had quitted Grantham.[4] His mechanical carriage was a vehicle\r\nwith four wheels, which was put in motion with a handle wrought by the\r\nperson who sat in it, but, like Merlin’s chair, it seems to have been\r\nused only on the smooth surface of a floor, and not fitted to overcome\r\nthe inequalities of a road. Although Newton was at this time “a sober,\r\nsilent, thinking lad,” who scarcely ever joined in the ordinary games\r\nof his schoolfellows, yet he took great pleasure in providing them with\r\namusements of a scientific character. He introduced into the school\r\nthe flying of paper kites; and he is said to have been at great pains\r\nin determining their best forms and proportions, and in ascertaining\r\nthe position and number of the points by which the string should be\r\nattached. He made also paper lanterns, by the light of which he went\r\nto school in the winter mornings, and he frequently attached these\r\nlanterns to the tails of his kites in a dark night, so as to inspire\r\nthe country people with the belief that they were comets.\r\n\r\nIn the house where he lodged there were some female inmates in whose\r\ncompany he appears to have taken much pleasure. One of these, a\r\nMiss Storey, sister to Dr. Storey, a physician at Buckminster, near\r\nColsterworth, was two or three years younger than Newton, and to great\r\npersonal attractions she seems to have added more than the usual\r\nallotment of female talent. The society of this young lady and her\r\ncompanions was always preferred to that of his own schoolfellows, and\r\nit was one of his most agreeable occupations to construct for them\r\nlittle tables and cupboards, and other utensils for holding their dolls\r\nand their trinkets. He had lived nearly six years in the same house\r\nwith Miss Storey, and there is reason to believe that their youthful\r\nfriendship gradually rose to a higher passion; but the smallness of her\r\nportion and the inadequacy of his own fortune appear to have prevented\r\nthe consummation of their happiness. Miss Storey was afterward twice\r\nmarried, and under the name of Mrs. Vincent, Dr. Stukely visited her\r\nat Grantham in 1727, at the age of eighty-two, and obtained from her\r\nmany particulars respecting the early history of our author. Newton’s\r\nesteem for her continued unabated during his life. He regularly visited\r\nher when he went to Lincolnshire, and never failed to relieve her from\r\nlittle pecuniary difficulties which seem to have beset her family.\r\n\r\nAmong the early passions of Newton we must recount his love of drawing;\r\nand even of writing verses. His own room was furnished with pictures\r\ndrawn, coloured, and framed by himself, sometimes from copies, but\r\noften from life.[5] Among these were portraits of Dr. Donne, Mr.\r\nStokes, the master of Grantham school, and King Charles I. under whose\r\npicture were the following verses.\r\n\r\n    A secret art my soul requires to try,\r\n    If prayers can give me what the wars deny.\r\n    Three crowns distinguished here, in order do\r\n    Present their objects to my knowing view.\r\n    Earth’s crown, thus at my feet I can disdain,\r\n    Which heavy is, and at the best but vain.\r\n    But now a crown of thorns I gladly greet,\r\n    Sharp is this crown, but not so sharp as sweet;\r\n    The crown of glory that I yonder see\r\n    Is full of bliss and of eternity.\r\n\r\nThese verses were repeated to Dr. Stukely by Mrs. Vincent, who believed\r\nthem to be written by Sir Isaac, a circumstance which is the more\r\nprobable, as he himself assured Mr. Conduit, with some expression of\r\npleasure, that he “excelled in making verses,” although he had been\r\nheard to express a contempt for poetical composition.\r\n\r\nBut while the mind of our young philosopher was principally occupied\r\nwith the pursuits which we have now detailed, it was not inattentive\r\nto the movements of the celestial bodies, on which he was destined to\r\nthrow such a brilliant light. The imperfections of his waterclock had\r\nprobably directed his thoughts to the more accurate measure of time\r\nwhich the motion of the sun afforded. In the yard of the house where\r\nhe lived, he traced the varying movements of that luminary upon the\r\nwalls and roofs of the buildings, and by means of fixed pins he had\r\nmarked out the hourly and half-hourly subdivisions. One of these dials,\r\nwhich went by the name of _Isaac’s dial_, and was often referred to\r\nby the country people for the hour of the day, appears to have been\r\ndrawn solely from the observations of several years; but we are not\r\ninformed whether all the dials which he drew on the wall of his house\r\nat Woolsthorpe, and which existed after his death, were of the same\r\ndescription, or were projected from his knowledge of the doctrine of\r\nthe sphere.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of the Reverend Mr. Smith in the year 1656, his widow\r\nleft the rectory of North Witham, and took up her residence at\r\nWoolsthorpe along with her three children, Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah\r\nSmith. Newton had now attained the fifteenth year of his age, and had\r\nmade great progress in his studies; and as he was thought capable of\r\nbeing useful in the management of the farm and country business at\r\nWoolsthorpe, his mother, chiefly from a motive of economy, recalled\r\nhim from the school at Grantham. In order to accustom him to the art\r\nof selling and buying, two of the most important branches of rural\r\nlabour, he was frequently sent on Saturday to Grantham market to\r\ndispose of grain and other articles of farm produce, and to purchase\r\nsuch necessaries as the family required. As he had yet acquired no\r\nexperience, an old trustworthy servant generally accompanied him on\r\nthese errands. The inn which they patronised was the Saracen’s Head at\r\nWest Gate; but no sooner had they put up their horses than our young\r\nphilosopher deserted his commercial concerns, and betook himself to\r\nhis former lodging in the apothecary’s garret, where a number of Mr.\r\nClark’s old books afforded him abundance of entertainment till his aged\r\nguardian had executed the family commissions, and announced to him the\r\nnecessity of returning. At other times he deserted his duties at an\r\nearlier stage, and intrenched himself under a hedge by the way-side,\r\nwhere he continued his studies till the servant returned from Grantham.\r\nThe more immediate affairs of the farm were not more prosperous under\r\nhis management than would have been his marketings at Grantham. The\r\nperusal of a book, the execution of a model, or the superintendence of\r\na waterwheel of his own construction, whirling the glittering spray\r\nfrom some neighbouring stream, absorbed all his thoughts when the sheep\r\nwere going astray, and the cattle were devouring or treading down the\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith was soon convinced from experience that her son was not\r\ndestined to cultivate the soil, and as his passion for study, and his\r\ndislike for every other occupation increased with his years, she wisely\r\nresolved to give him all the advantages which education could confer.\r\nHe was accordingly sent back to Grantham school, where he continued\r\nfor some months in busy preparation for his academical studies. His\r\nuncle, the Reverend W. Ayscough, who was rector of Burton Coggles,\r\nabout three miles east of Woolsthorpe, and who had himself studied at\r\nTrinity College, recommended to his nephew to enter that society, and\r\nit was accordingly determined that he should proceed to Cambridge at\r\nthe approaching term.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  _Newton enters Trinity College, Cambridge—Origin of his Propensity\r\n    for Mathematics—He studies the Geometry of Descartes unassisted—\r\n    Purchases a Prism—Revises Dr. Harrow’s Optical Lectures—Dr.\r\n    Barrow’s Opinion respecting Colours—Takes his Degrees—Is appointed\r\n    a Fellow of Trinity College—Succeeds Dr. Barrow in the Lucasian\r\n    Chair of Mathematics._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a young mind thirsting for knowledge, and ambitious of the\r\ndistinction which it brings, the transition from a village school\r\nto a university like that of Cambridge,—from the absolute solitude\r\nof thought to the society of men imbued with all the literature and\r\nscience of the age,—must be one of eventful interest. To Newton it was\r\na source of peculiar excitement. The history of science affords many\r\nexamples where the young aspirant had been early initiated into her\r\nmysteries, and had even exercised his powers of invention and discovery\r\nbefore he was admitted within the walls of a college; but he who was to\r\ngive philosophy her laws did not exhibit such early talent; no friendly\r\ncounsel regulated his youthful studies, and no work of scientific\r\neminence seems to have guided him in his course. In yielding to the\r\nimpulse of his mechanical genius, his mind obeyed the laws of its own\r\nnatural expansion, and, following the line of least resistance, it was\r\nthus drawn aside from the strongholds with which it was destined to\r\ngrapple.\r\n\r\nWhen Newton, therefore, arrived at Trinity College, he brought with\r\nhim a more slender portion of science than falls to the lot of\r\nordinary scholars; but this state of his acquirements was perhaps not\r\nunfavourable to the development of his powers. Unexhausted by premature\r\ngrowth, and invigorated by healthful repose, his mind was the better\r\nfitted to make those vigorous and rapid shoots which soon covered with\r\nfoliage and with fruit the genial soil to which it had been transferred.\r\n\r\nCambridge was consequently the real birthplace of Newton’s genius. Her\r\nteachers fostered his earliest studies;—her institutions sustained his\r\nmightiest efforts;—and within her precincts were all his discoveries\r\nmade and perfected. When he was called to higher official functions,\r\nhis disciples kept up the pre-eminence of their master’s philosophy,\r\nand their successors have maintained this seat of learning in the\r\nfulness of its glory, and rendered it the most distinguished among the\r\nuniversities of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 5th of June, 1660, in the 18th year of his age, that\r\nNewton was admitted into Trinity College, Cambridge, during the same\r\nyear that Dr. Barrow was elected professor of Greek in the university.\r\nHis attention was first turned to the study of mathematics by a desire\r\nto inquire into the truth of judicial astrology; and he is said to have\r\ndiscovered the folly of that study by erecting a figure with the aid\r\nof one or two of the problems of Euclid. The propositions contained in\r\nthis ancient system of geometry he regarded as self-evident truths; and\r\nwithout any preliminary study he made himself master of Descartes’s\r\nGeometry by his genius and patient application. This neglect of the\r\nelementary truths of geometry he afterward regarded as a mistake in\r\nhis mathematical studies, and he expressed to Dr. Pemberton his regret\r\nthat “he had applied himself to the works of Descartes, and other\r\nalgebraic writers, before he had considered the elements of Euclid with\r\nthat attention which so excellent a writer deserved.[7] Dr. Wallis’s\r\nArithmetic of Infinites, Saunderson’s Logic, and the Optics of Kepler\r\nwere among the books which he had studied with care. On these works he\r\nwrote comments during their perusal; and so great was his progress,\r\nthat he is reported to have found himself more deeply versed in some\r\nbranches of knowledge than the tutor who directed his studies.\r\n\r\nNeither history nor tradition has handed down to us any particular\r\naccount of his progress during the first three years that he spent at\r\nCambridge. It appears from a statement of his expenses, that in 1664\r\nhe purchased a prism, for the purpose, as has been said, of examining\r\nDescartes’s theory of colours; and it is stated by Mr. Conduit, that\r\nhe soon established his own views on the subject, and detected the\r\nerrors in those of the French philosopher. This, however, does not\r\nseem to have been the case. Had he discovered the composition of light\r\nin 1664 or 1665, it is not likely that he would have withheld it, not\r\nonly from the Royal Society, but from his own friends at Cambridge till\r\nthe year 1671. His friend and tutor, Dr. Barrow, was made Lucasian\r\nProfessor of Mathematics in 1663, and the optical lectures which he\r\nafterward delivered were published in 1669. In the preface of this work\r\nhe acknowledges his obligations to his colleague, Mr. Isaac Newton,[8]\r\nfor having revised the MSS., and corrected several oversights, and\r\nmade some important suggestions. In the twelfth lecture there are\r\nsome observations on the nature and origin of colours, which Newton\r\ncould not have permitted his friend to publish had he been then in\r\npossession of their true theory. According to Dr. Barrow, _White_ is\r\nthat which discharges a copious light equally clear in every direction;\r\n_Black_ is that which does not emit light at all, or which does it very\r\nsparingly. _Red_ is that which emits a light more clear than usual, but\r\ninterrupted by shady interstices. _Blue_ is that which discharges a\r\nrarified light, as in bodies which consist of white and black particles\r\narranged alternately. _Green_ is nearly allied to blue. _Yellow_ is\r\na mixture of much white and a little red; and _Purple_ consists of a\r\ngreat deal of blue mixed with a small portion of red. The blue colour\r\nof the sea arises from the whiteness of the salt which it contains,\r\nmixed with the blackness of the pure water in which the salt is\r\ndissolved; and the blueness of the shadows of bodies, seen at the same\r\ntime by candle and daylight, arises from the whiteness of the paper\r\nmixed with the faint light or blackness of the twilight. These opinions\r\nsavour so little of genuine philosophy that they must have attracted\r\nthe observation of Newton, and had he discovered at that time that\r\nwhite was a mixture of all the colours, and black a privation of them\r\nall, he could not have permitted the absurd speculations of his master\r\nto pass uncorrected.\r\n\r\nThat Newton had not distinguished himself by any positive discovery\r\nso early as 1664 or 1665, may be inferred also from the circumstances\r\nwhich attended the competition for the law fellowship of Trinity\r\nCollege. The candidates for this appointment were himself and Mr.\r\nRobert Uvedale; and Dr. Barrow, then Master of Trinity, having found\r\nthem perfectly equal in their attainments, conferred the fellowship on\r\nMr. Uvedale as the senior candidate.\r\n\r\nIn the books of the university, Newton is recorded as having been\r\nadmitted sub-sizer in 1661. He became a scholar in 1664. In 1665 he\r\ntook his degree of Bachelor of Arts, and in 1666, in consequence of\r\nthe breaking out of the plague, he retired to Woolsthorpe. In 1667 he\r\nwas made Junior Fellow. In 1668 he took his degree of Master of Arts,\r\nand in the same year he was appointed to a Senior Fellowship. In 1669,\r\nwhen Dr. Barrow had resolved to devote his attention to theology, he\r\nresigned the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics in favour of Newton,\r\nwho may now be considered as having entered upon that brilliant career\r\nof discovery the history of which will form the subject of some of the\r\nfollowing chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  _Newton, occupied in grinding Hyperbolical Lenses—His first\r\n    Experiments with the Prism made in 1666—He discovers the Composition\r\n    of White Light, and the different Refrangibility of the Rays which\r\n    compose it—Abandons his Attempts to improve Refracting Telescopes\r\n    and resolves to attempt the Construction of Reflecting ones—He\r\n    quits Cambridge on account of the Plague—Constructs two Reflecting\r\n    Telescopes in 1668, the first ever executed—One of them examined by\r\n    the Royal Society, and shown to the King—He constructs a Telescope\r\n    with Glass Specula—Recent History of the Reflecting Telescope—\r\n    Mr. Airy’s Glass Specula—Hadley’s Reflecting Telescopes—Short’s—\r\n    Herschel’s—Ramage’s—Lord Oxmantown’s._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Newton to the Lucasian chair at Cambridge seems to\r\nhave been coeval with his grandest discoveries. The first of these\r\nof which the date is well authenticated is that of the different\r\nrefrangibility of the rays of light, which he established in 1666. The\r\ngerm of the doctrine of universal gravitation seems to have presented\r\nitself to him in the same year, or at least in 1667; and “in the year\r\n1666 or before”[9] he was in possession of his method of fluxions, and\r\nhe had brought it to such a state in the beginning of 1669, that he\r\npermitted Dr. Barrow to communicate it to Mr. Collins on the 20th of\r\nJune in that year.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have already mentioned, on the authority of a written\r\nmemorandum of Newton himself, that he purchased a prism at Cambridge\r\nin 1664, yet he does not appear to have made any use of it, as he\r\ninforms us that it was in 1666 that he “procured a triangular glass\r\nprism to try therewith the celebrated phenomena of colours.”[10] During\r\nthat year he had applied himself to the grinding of “optic glasses,\r\nof other figures than spherical,” and having, no doubt, experienced\r\nthe impracticability of executing such lenses, the idea of examining\r\nthe phenomena of colour was one of those sagacious and fortunate\r\nimpulses which more than once led him to discovery. Descartes in his\r\n_Dioptrice_, published in 1629, and more recently James Gregory in\r\nhis _Optica Promota_ published in 1663, had shown that parallel and\r\ndiverging rays could be reflected or refracted, with mathematical\r\naccuracy, to a point or focus, by giving the surface a parabolic, an\r\nelliptical, or a hyperbolic form, or some other form not spherical.\r\nDescartes had even invented and described machines by which lenses of\r\nthese shapes could be ground and polished, and the perfection of the\r\nrefracting telescope was supposed to depend on the degree of accuracy\r\nwith which they could be executed.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to grind glasses that were not spherical, Newton seems\r\nto have conjectured that the defects of lenses, and consequently of\r\nrefracting telescopes, might arise from some other cause than the\r\nimperfect convergency of rays to a single point, and this conjecture\r\nwas happily realized in those fine discoveries of which we shall now\r\nendeavour to give some account.\r\n\r\nWhen Newton began this inquiry, philosophers of the highest genius\r\nwere directing all the energies of their mind to the subject of light,\r\nand to the improvement of the refracting telescope. James Gregory of\r\nAberdeen had invented his reflecting telescope. Descartes had explained\r\nthe theory and exerted himself in perfecting the construction of\r\nthe common refracting telescope, and Huygens had not only executed\r\nthe magnificent instruments by which he discovered the ring and\r\nthe satellites of Saturn, but had begun those splendid researches\r\nrespecting the nature of light, and the phenomena of double refraction,\r\nwhich have led his successors to such brilliant discoveries. Newton,\r\ntherefore, arose when the science of light was ready for some great\r\naccession, and at the precise time when he was required to propagate\r\nthe impulse which it had received from his illustrious predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe ignorance which then prevailed respecting the nature and origin of\r\ncolours is sufficiently apparent from the account we have already given\r\nof Dr. Barrow’s speculations on this subject. It was always supposed\r\nthat light of every colour was equally refracted or bent out of its\r\ndirection when it passed through any lens or prism, or other refracting\r\nmedium; and though the exhibition of colours by the prism had been\r\noften made previous to the time of Newton, yet no philosopher seems to\r\nhave attempted to analyze the phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1._]\r\n\r\nWhen he had procured his triangular glass prism, a section of\r\nwhich is shown at ABC, (_fig. 1_,) he made a hole H in one of his\r\nwindow-shutters, SHT, and having darkened his chamber, he let in a\r\nconvenient quantity of the sun’s light RR, which, passing through\r\nthe prism ABC, was so refracted as to exhibit all the different\r\ncolours on the wall at MN, forming an image about five times as long\r\nas it was broad. “It was at first,” says our author, “a very pleasing\r\ndivertisement to view the vivid and intense colours produced thereby,”\r\nbut this pleasure was immediately succeeded by surprise at various\r\ncircumstances which he had not expected. According to the received\r\nlaws of refraction, he expected the image MN to be circular, like the\r\nwhite image at W, which the sunbeam RR had formed on the wall previous\r\nto the interposition of the prism; but when he found it to be no less\r\nthan five times larger than its breadth, it “excited in him a more\r\nthan ordinary curiosity to examine from whence it might proceed. He\r\ncould scarcely think that the various thickness of the glass, or the\r\ntermination with shadow or darkness, could have any influence on light\r\nto produce such an effect: yet he thought it not amiss first to examine\r\nthose circumstances, and so find what would happen by transmitting\r\nlight through parts of the glass of divers thicknesses, or through\r\nholes in the window of divers bignesses, or by setting the prism\r\nwithout (on the other side of ST), so that the light might pass through\r\nit and be refracted before it was terminated by the hole; but he found\r\nnone of these circumstances material. The fashion of the colours was in\r\nall those cases the same.”\r\n\r\nNewton next suspected that some unevenness in the glass, or other\r\naccidental irregularity, might cause the dilatation of the colours. In\r\norder to try this, he took another prism BCB′, and placed it in such a\r\nmanner that the light RRW passing through them both might be refracted\r\ncontrary ways, and thus returned by BCB′ into that course RRW, from\r\nwhich the prism ABC had diverted it, for by this means he thought\r\nthe regular effects of the prism ABC would be destroyed by the prism\r\nBCB′, and the irregular ones more augmented by the multiplicity of\r\nrefractions. The result was, that the light which was diffused by the\r\nfirst prism ABC into an oblong form, was reduced by the second prism\r\nBCB′ into a circular one W, with as much regularity as when it did not\r\npass through them at all; so that whatever was the cause of the length\r\nof the image MN, it did not arise from any irregularity in the prism.\r\n\r\nOur author next proceeded to examine more critically what might be\r\neffected by the difference of the incidence of the rays proceeding from\r\ndifferent parts of the sun’s disk: but by taking accurate measures of\r\nthe lines and angles, he found that the angle of the emergent rays\r\nshould be 31 minutes equal to the sun’s diameter, whereas the real\r\nangle subtended by MN at the hole H was 2° 49′. But as this computation\r\nwas founded on the hypothesis, that the sine of the angle of incidence\r\nwas proportional to the sine of the angle of refraction, which from\r\nhis own experience he could not imagine to be so erroneous as to make\r\nthat angle but 31′, which was in reality 2° 49′, yet “his curiosity\r\ncaused him again to take up his prism” ABC, and having turned it round\r\nin both directions, so as to make the rays RR fall both with greater\r\nand with less obliquity upon the face AC, he found that the colours on\r\nthe wall did not sensibly change their place; and hence he obtained a\r\ndecided proof that they could not be occasioned by a difference in the\r\nincidence of the light radiating from different parts of the sun’s disk.\r\n\r\nNewton then began to suspect that the rays, after passing through the\r\nprism, might move in curve lines, and, in proportion to the different\r\ndegrees of curvature, might tend to different parts of the wall; and\r\nthis suspicion was strengthened by the recollection that he had often\r\nseen a tennis-ball struck with an oblique racket describe such a curve\r\nline. In this case a circular and a progressive motion is communicated\r\nto the ball by the stroke, and in consequence of this, the direction\r\nof its motion was curvilineal, so that if the rays of light were\r\nglobular bodies, they might acquire a circulating motion by their\r\noblique passage out of one medium into another, and thus move like the\r\ntennis-ball in a curve line. Notwithstanding, however, “this plausible\r\nground of suspicion,” he could discover no such curvature in their\r\ndirection, and, what was enough for his purpose, he observed that the\r\ndifference between the length MN of the image, and the diameter of the\r\nhole H, was proportional to their distance HM, which could not have\r\nhappened had the rays moved in curvilineal paths.\r\n\r\nThese different hypotheses, or suspicions, as Newton calls them, being\r\nthus gradually removed, he was at length led to an experiment which\r\ndetermined beyond a doubt the true cause of the elongation of the\r\ncoloured image. Having taken a board with a small hole in it, he placed\r\nit behind the face BC of the prism, and close to it, so that he could\r\ntransmit through the hole any one of the colours in MN, and keep back\r\nall the rest. When the hole, for example, was near C, no other light\r\nbut the red fell upon the wall at N. He then placed behind N another\r\nboard with a hole in it, and behind this board he placed another prism,\r\nso as to receive the red light at N, which passed through this hole in\r\nthe second board. He then turned round the first prism ABC so as to\r\nmake all the colours pass in succession through these two holes, and he\r\nmarked their places on the wall. From the variation of these places, he\r\nsaw that the _red_ rays at N were less refracted by the second prism\r\nthan the _orange_ rays, the _orange_ less than the _yellow_, and so on,\r\nthe _violet_ being more refracted than all the rest.\r\n\r\nHence he drew the grand conclusion, _that light was not homogeneous,\r\nbut consisted of rays, some of which were more refrangible than others_.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this important truth was established, Sir Isaac saw that a\r\nlens which refracts light exactly like a prism must also refract the\r\ndifferently coloured rays with different degrees of force, bringing\r\nthe violet rays to a focus nearer the glass than the red rays. This is\r\nshown in _fig. 2_, where LL is a convex lens, and S, L, SL rays of the\r\nsun falling upon it in parallel directions. The violet rays existing in\r\nthe white light SL being more refrangible than the rest, will be more\r\nrefracted or bent, and will meet at V, forming there a violet image of\r\nthe sun. In like manner the yellow rays will form an image of the sun\r\nat Y, and so on, the red rays, which are the least refrangible, being\r\nbrought to a focus at R, and there forming a red image of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2._]\r\n\r\nHence, if we suppose LL to be the object-glass of a telescope directed\r\nto the sun, and MM an eye-glass through which the eye at E sees\r\nmagnified the image or picture of the sun formed by LL, it cannot see\r\ndistinctly all the different images between R and V. If it is adjusted\r\nso as to see distinctly the _yellow_ image at Y, as it is in the\r\nfigure, it will not see distinctly either the _red_ or _violet_ images,\r\nnor indeed any of them but the yellow one. There will consequently be a\r\ndistinct yellow image, with indistinct images of all the other colours,\r\nproducing great confusion and indistinctness of vision. As soon as Sir\r\nIsaac perceived this result of his discovery, he abandoned his attempts\r\nto improve the refracting telescope, and took into consideration the\r\nprinciple of reflection; and as he found that rays of all colours were\r\nreflected regularly, so that the angle of reflection was equal to the\r\nangle of incidence, he concluded that, upon this principle, _optical\r\ninstruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable_,\r\nprovided a reflecting substance could be found which could polish as\r\nfinely as glass, and reflect as much light as glass transmits, and\r\nprovided a method of communicating to it a parabolic figure could be\r\nobtained. These difficulties, however, appeared to him very great,\r\nand he even thought them insuperable when he considered that, as any\r\nirregularity in a reflecting surface makes the rays deviate five or\r\nsix times more from their true path than similar irregularities in a\r\nrefracting surface, a much greater degree of nicety would be required\r\nin figuring reflecting specula than refracting lenses.\r\n\r\nSuch was the progress of Newton’s optical discoveries, when he was\r\nforced to quit Cambridge in 1666 by the plague which then desolated\r\nEngland, and more than two years elapsed before he proceeded any\r\nfarther. In 1668 he resumed the inquiry, and having thought of a\r\ndelicate method of polishing, proper for metals, by which, as he\r\nconceived, “the figure would be corrected to the last,” he began to put\r\nthis method to the test of experiment. At this time he was acquainted\r\nwith the proposal of Mr. James Gregory, contained in his _Optica\r\nPromota_, to construct a reflecting telescope with two concave specula,\r\nthe largest of which had a hole in the middle of the larger speculum,\r\nto transmit the light to an eye-glass;[11] but he conceived that it\r\nwould be an improvement on this instrument to place the eye-glass at\r\nthe side of the tube, and to reflect the rays to it by an oval plane\r\nspeculum. One of these instruments he actually executed with his own\r\nhands; and he gave an account of it in a letter to a friend, dated\r\nFebruary 23d, 1668–9, a letter which is also remarkable for containing\r\nthe first allusion to his discoveries respecting colours. Previous to\r\nthis he was in correspondence on the subject with Mr. Ent, afterward\r\nSir George Ent, one of the original council of the Royal Society, an\r\neminent medical writer of his day, and President of the College of\r\nPhysicians. In a letter to Mr. Ent he had promised an account of his\r\ntelescope to their mutual friend, and the letter to which we now allude\r\ncontained the fulfilment of that promise. The telescope was six inches\r\nlong. It bore an aperture in the large speculum something more than\r\nan inch, and as the eye-glass was a plano-convex lens, whose focal\r\nlength was one-sixth or one-seventh of an inch, it magnified about\r\nforty times, which, as Newton remarks, was more than any six-foot\r\ntube (meaning refracting telescopes) could do with distinctness. On\r\naccount of the badness of the materials, however, and the want of a\r\ngood polish, it represented objects less distinct than a six-feet tube,\r\nthough he still thought it would be equal to a three or four feet tube\r\ndirected to common objects. He had seen through it Jupiter distinctly\r\nwith his four satellites, and also the horns or moon-like phases of\r\nVenus, though this last phenomenon required some niceness in adjusting\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nAlthough Newton considered this little instrument as in itself\r\ncontemptible, yet he regarded it as an “epitome of what might be done;”\r\nand he expressed his conviction that a six-feet telescope might be made\r\nafter this method, which would perform as well as a sixty or a hundred\r\nfeet telescope made in the common way; and that if a common refracting\r\ntelescope could be made of the “purest glass exquisitely polished,\r\nwith the best figure that any geometrician (Descartes, &c.) hath or\r\ncan design,” it would scarcely perform better than a common telescope.\r\nThis, he adds, may seem a paradoxical assertion, yet he continues, “it\r\nis the necessary consequence of some experiments which I have made\r\nconcerning the nature of light.”\r\n\r\nThe telescope now described possesses a very peculiar interest, as\r\nbeing the first reflecting one which was ever executed and directed to\r\nthe heavens. James Gregory, indeed, had attempted, in 1664 or 1665, to\r\nconstruct his instrument. He employed Messrs. Rives and Cox, who were\r\ncelebrated glass-grinders of that time, to execute a concave speculum\r\nof six feet radius, and likewise a small one; but as they had failed\r\nin polishing the large one, and as Mr. Gregory was on the eve of going\r\nabroad, he troubled himself no farther about the experiment, and the\r\ntube of the telescope was never made. Some time afterward, indeed, he\r\n“made some trials both with a little concave and convex speculum,” but,\r\n“possessed with the fancy of the defective figure, he would not be at\r\nthe pains to fix every thing in its due distance.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the earliest attempts to construct the reflecting telescope,\r\nthat noble instrument which has since effected such splendid\r\ndiscoveries in astronomy. Looking back from the present advanced state\r\nof practical science, how great is the contrast between the loose\r\nspecula of Gregory and the fine Gregorian telescopes of Hadley, Short,\r\nand Veitch,—between the humble six-inch tube of Newton and the gigantic\r\ninstruments of Herschel and Ramage.\r\n\r\nThe success of this first experiment inspired Newton with fresh zeal,\r\nand though his mind was now occupied with his optical discoveries,\r\nwith the elements of his method of fluxions, and with the expanding\r\ngerm of his theory of universal gravitation, yet with all the ardour\r\nof youth he applied himself to the laborious operation of executing\r\nanother reflecting telescope with his own hands. This instrument,\r\nwhich was better than the first, though it lay by him several years,\r\nexcited some interest at Cambridge; and Sir Isaac himself informs us,\r\nthat one of the fellows of Trinity College had completed a telescope\r\nof the same kind, which he considered as somewhat superior to his own.\r\nThe existence of these telescopes having become known to the Royal\r\nSociety, Newton was requested to send his instrument for examination\r\nto that learned body. He accordingly transmitted it to Mr. Oldenburg\r\nin December, 1671, and from this epoch his name began to acquire that\r\ncelebrity by which it has been so peculiarly distinguished.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January, 1672, it was announced to the Royal Society\r\nthat his reflecting telescope had been shown to the king, and had\r\nbeen examined by the president, Sir Robert Moray, Sir Paul Neale, Sir\r\nChristopher Wren, and Mr. Hook. These gentlemen entertained so high an\r\nopinion of it, that, in order to secure the honour of the contrivance\r\nto its author, they advised the inventor to send a drawing and\r\ndescription of it to Mr. Huygens at Paris. Mr. Oldenburg accordingly\r\ndrew up a description of it in Latin, which, after being corrected\r\nby Mr. Newton, was transmitted to that eminent philosopher. This\r\ntelescope, of which the annexed is an accurate drawing, is carefully\r\npreserved in the library of the Royal Society of London, with the\r\nfollowing inscription:—\r\n\r\n  “_Invented by Sir Isaac Newton and made with his own hands, 1671._”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3._\r\n\r\n_Sir Isaac Newton’s Reflecting Telescope._]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Newton executed any other reflecting telescopes\r\nthan the two we have mentioned. He informs us that he repolished and\r\ngreatly improved a fourteen-feet object-glass, executed by a London\r\nartist, and having proposed in 1678 to substitute glass reflectors in\r\nplace of metallic specula, he tried to make a reflecting telescope\r\non this principle four feet long, and with a magnifying power of\r\n150. The glass was wrought by a London artist, and though it seemed\r\nwell finished, yet, when it was quicksilvered on its convex side, it\r\nexhibited all over the glass innumerable inequalities, which gave an\r\nindistinctness to every object. He expresses, however, his conviction\r\nthat nothing but good workmanship is wanting to perfect these\r\ntelescopes, and he recommends their consideration “to the curious in\r\nfiguring glasses.”\r\n\r\nFor a period of fifty years this recommendation excited no notice.\r\nAt last Mr. James Short of Edinburgh, an artist of consummate skill,\r\nexecuted about the year 1730 no fewer than six reflecting telescopes\r\nwith glass specula, three of fifteen inches, and three of nine inches\r\nin focal length. He found it extremely troublesome to give them a true\r\nfigure with parallel surfaces; and several of them when finished turned\r\nout useless, in consequence of the veins which then appeared in the\r\nglass. Although these instruments performed remarkably well, yet the\r\nlight was fainter than he expected, and from this cause, combined with\r\nthe difficulty of finishing them, he afterward devoted his labours\r\nsolely to those with metallic specula.\r\n\r\nAt a later period, in 1822, Mr. G. B. Airy of Trinity College, and\r\none of the distinguished successors of Newton in the Lucasian chair,\r\nresumed the consideration of glass specula, and demonstrated that the\r\naberration both of figure and of colour might be corrected in these\r\ninstruments. Upon this ingenious principle Mr. Airy executed more\r\nthan one telescope, but though the result of the experiment was such\r\nas to excite hopes of ultimate success, yet the construction of such\r\ninstruments is still a desideratum in practical science.\r\n\r\nSuch were the attempts which Sir Isaac Newton made to construct\r\nreflecting telescopes; but notwithstanding the success of his labours,\r\nneither the philosopher nor the practical optician seems to have had\r\ncourage to pursue them. A London artist, indeed, undertook to imitate\r\nthese instruments; but Sir Isaac informs us, that “he fell much short\r\nof what he had attained, as he afterward understood by discoursing\r\nwith the under workmen he had employed.” After a long period of fifty\r\nyears, John Hadley, Esq. of Essex, a Fellow of the Royal Society, began\r\nin 1719 or 1720 to execute a reflecting telescope. His scientific\r\nknowledge and his manual dexterity fitted him admirably for such a\r\ntask, and, probably after many failures, he constructed two large\r\ntelescopes about five feet three inches long, one of which, with a\r\nspeculum six inches in diameter, was presented to the Royal Society in\r\n1723. The celebrated Dr. Bradley and the Rev. Mr. Pound compared it\r\nwith the great Huygenian refractor 123 feet long. It bore as high a\r\nmagnifying power as the Huygenian telescope: it showed objects equally\r\ndistinct, though not altogether so clear and bright, and it exhibited\r\nevery celestial object that had been discovered by Huygens,—the five\r\nsatellites of Saturn, the shadow of Jupiter’s satellites on his disk,\r\nthe black list in Saturn’s ring, and the edge of his shadow cast on the\r\nring. Encouraged and instructed by Mr. Hadley, Dr. Bradley began the\r\nconstruction of reflecting telescopes, and succeeded so well that he\r\nwould have completed one of them, had he not been obliged to change his\r\nresidence. Some time afterward he and the Honourable Samuel Molyneux\r\nundertook the task together at Kew, and attempted to execute specula\r\nabout twenty-six inches in focal length; but notwithstanding Dr.\r\nBradley’s former experience, and Mr. Hadley’s frequent instructions,\r\nit was a long time before they succeeded. The first good instrument\r\nwhich they finished was in May, 1724. It was twenty-six inches in focal\r\nlength; but they afterward completed a very large one of eight feet,\r\nthe largest that had ever been made. The first of these instruments was\r\nafterward elegantly fitted up by Mr. Molyneux, and presented to his\r\nmajesty John V. King of Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe great object of these two able astronomers was to reduce the\r\nmethod of making specula to such a degree of certainty that they\r\ncould be manufactured for public sale. Mr. Hauksbee had indeed made a\r\ngood one about three and a half feet long, and had proceeded to the\r\nexecution of two others, one of six feet, and another of twelve feet\r\nin focal length; but Mr. Scarlet and Mr. Hearne, having received all\r\nthe information which Mr. Molyneux had acquired, constructed them\r\nfor public sale; and the reflecting telescope has ever since been an\r\narticle of trade with every regular optician.\r\n\r\nAs Sir Isaac Newton was at this time President of the Royal Society,\r\nhe had the high satisfaction of seeing his own invention become an\r\ninstrument of public use, and of great advantage to science, and\r\nhe no doubt felt the full influence of this triumph of his skill.\r\nStill, however, the reflecting telescope had not achieved any new\r\ndiscovery in the heavens. The latest accession to astronomy had been\r\nmade by the ordinary refractors of Huygens, labouring under all the\r\nimperfections of coloured light; and this long pause in astronomical\r\ndiscovery seemed to indicate that man had carried to its farthest\r\nlimits his power of penetrating into the depths of the universe.\r\nThis, however, was only one of those stationary positions from which\r\nhuman genius takes a new and a loftier elevation. While the English\r\nopticians were thus practising the recent art of grinding specula, Mr.\r\nJames Short of Edinburgh was devoting to the subject all the energies\r\nof his youthful mind. In 1732, and in the 22d year of his age, he\r\nbegan his labours, and he carried to such high perfection the art of\r\ngrinding and polishing specula, and of giving them the true parabolic\r\nfigure, that, with a telescope fifteen inches in focal length, he\r\nread in the Philosophical Transactions at the distance of 500 feet,\r\nand frequently saw the five satellites of Saturn together,—a power\r\nwhich was beyond the reach even of Hadley’s six-feet instrument. The\r\ncelebrated Maclaurin compared the telescopes of Short with those made\r\nby the best London artists, and so great was their superiority, that\r\nhis small telescopes were invariably superior to larger ones from\r\nLondon. In 1742, after he had settled as an optician in the metropolis,\r\nhe executed for Lord Thomas Spencer a reflecting telescope, twelve\r\nfeet in focal length, for 630_l._; in 1752 he completed one for the\r\nKing of Spain, at the expense of 1200_l._; and a short time before\r\nhis death, which took place in 1768, he finished the specula of the\r\nlarge telescope which was mounted equatorially for the observatory of\r\nEdinburgh by his brother Thomas Short, who was offered twelve hundred\r\nguineas for it by the King of Denmark.\r\n\r\nAlthough the superiority of these instruments, which were all of the\r\nGregorian form, demonstrated the value of the reflecting telescope, yet\r\nno skilful hand had yet directed it to the heavens; and it was reserved\r\nfor Dr. Herschel to employ it as an instrument of discovery, to exhibit\r\nto the eye of man new worlds and new systems, and to bring within\r\nthe grasp of his reason those remote regions of space to which his\r\nimagination even had scarcely ventured to extend its power. So early as\r\n1774 he completed a _five_-feet Newtonian reflector, and he afterward\r\nexecuted no fewer than _two hundred_ 7 feet, _one hundred and fifty_\r\n10 feet, and _eighty_ 20 feet specula. In 1781 he began a reflector\r\nthirty feet long, and having a speculum thirty-six inches in diameter;\r\nand under the munificent patronage of George III. he completed,\r\nin 1789, his gigantic instrument forty feet long, with a speculum\r\n_forty-nine and a half_ inches in diameter. The genius and perseverance\r\nwhich created instruments of such transcendent magnitude were not\r\nlikely to terminate with their construction. In the examination of\r\nthe starry heavens, the ultimate object of his labours, Dr. Herschel\r\nexhibited the same exalted qualifications, and in a few years he rose\r\nfrom the level of humble life to the enjoyment of a name more glorious\r\nthan that of the sages and warriors of ancient times, and as immortal\r\nas the objects with which it will be for ever associated. Nor was it\r\nin the ardour of the spring of life that these triumphs of reason were\r\nachieved. Dr. Herschel had reached the middle of his course before his\r\ncareer of discovery began, and it was in the autumn and winter of his\r\ndays that he reaped the full harvest of his glory. The discovery of a\r\nnew planet at the verge of the solar system was the first trophy of his\r\nskill, and new double and multiple stars, and new nebulæ, and groups of\r\ncelestial bodies were added in thousands to the system of the universe.\r\nThe spring-tide of knowledge which was thus let in upon the human mind\r\ncontinued for a while to spread its waves over Europe; but when it sank\r\nto its ebb in England, there was no other bark left upon the strand but\r\nthat of the Deucalion of Science, whose home had been so long upon its\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nDuring the life of Dr. Herschel, and during the reign, and within the\r\ndominions of his royal patron, four new planets were added to the solar\r\nsystem, but they were detected by telescopes of ordinary power; and we\r\nventure to state, that since the reign of George III. no attempt has\r\nbeen made to keep up the continuity of Dr. Herschel’s discoveries.\r\n\r\nMr. Herschel, his distinguished son, has indeed completed more\r\nthan one telescope of considerable size; Mr. Ramage, of Aberdeen,\r\nhas executed reflectors rivalling almost those of Slough;—and Lord\r\nOxmantown, an Irish nobleman of high promise, is now engaged on an\r\ninstrument of great size. But what avail the enthusiasm and the efforts\r\nof individual minds in the intellectual rivalry of nations? When the\r\nproud science of England pines in obscurity, blighted by the absence\r\nof the royal favour, and of the nation’s sympathy;—when its chivalry\r\nfall unwept and unhonoured;—how can it sustain the conflict against the\r\nhonoured and marshalled genius of foreign lands?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  _He delivers a Course of Optical Lectures at Cambridge—Is elected\r\n    Fellow of the Royal Society—He communicates to them his Discoveries\r\n    on the different Refrangibility and Nature of Light—Popular Account\r\n    of them—They involve him in various Controversies—His Dispute with\r\n    Pardies—Linus—Lucas—Dr. Hooke and Mr. Huygens—The Influence of\r\n    these Disputes on the Mind of Newton._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Newton delivered a course of lectures on optics in the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge in the years 1669, 1670, and 1671, containing\r\nhis principal discoveries relative to the different refrangibility of\r\nlight, yet it is a singular circumstance, that these discoveries should\r\nnot have become public through the conversation or correspondence of\r\nhis pupils. The Royal Society had acquired no knowledge of them till\r\nthe beginning of 1672, and his reputation in that body was founded\r\nchiefly on his reflecting telescope. On the 23d December, 1671, the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Seth Ward, Lord Bishop of Sarum, who was the author of\r\nseveral able works on astronomy, and had filled the astronomical chair\r\nat Oxford, proposed Mr. Newton as a Fellow of the Royal Society.\r\nThe satisfaction which he derived from this circumstance appears to\r\nhave been considerable; and in a letter to Mr. Oldenburg, of the 6th\r\nJanuary, he says, “I am very sensible of the honour done me by the\r\nBishop of Sarum in proposing me a candidate; and which, I hope, will\r\nbe further conferred upon me by my election into the Society; and if\r\nso, I shall endeavour to testify my gratitude, by communicating what\r\nmy poor and solitary endeavours can effect towards the promoting your\r\nphilosophical designs.” His election accordingly took place on the\r\n11th January, the same day on which the Society agreed to transmit a\r\ndescription of his telescope to Mr. Huygens at Paris. The notice of his\r\nelection, and the thanks of the Society for the communication of his\r\ntelescope, were conveyed in the same letter, with an assurance that\r\nthe Society “would take care that all right should be done him in the\r\nmatter of this invention.” In his next letter to Oldenburg, written\r\non the 18th January, 1671–2, he announces his optical discoveries in\r\nthe following remarkable manner: “I desire that in your next letter\r\nyou would inform me for what time the Society continue their weekly\r\nmeetings; because if they continue them for any time, I am purposing\r\nthem, to be considered of and examined, an account of a philosophical\r\ndiscovery which induced me to the making of the said telescope; and\r\nI doubt not but will prove much more grateful than the communication\r\nof that instrument; being in my judgment the oddest, if not the most\r\nconsiderable detection which hath hitherto been made in the operations\r\nof nature.”\r\n\r\nThis “considerable detection” was the discovery of the different\r\nrefrangibility of the rays of light which we have already explained,\r\nand which led to the construction of his reflecting telescope. It\r\nwas communicated to the Royal Society in a letter to Mr. Oldenburg,\r\ndated February 6th, and excited great interest among its members. The\r\n“solemn thanks” of the meeting were ordered to be transmitted to its\r\nauthor for his “very ingenious discourse.” A desire was expressed to\r\nhave it immediately printed, both for the purpose of having it well\r\nconsidered by philosophers, and for “securing the considerable notices\r\nthereof to the author against the arrogations of others;” and Dr. Seth\r\nWard, Bishop of Salisbury, Mr. Boyle, and Dr. Hooke were desired to\r\nperuse and consider it, and to bring in a report upon it to the Society.\r\n\r\nThe kindness of this distinguished body, and the anxiety which they\r\nhad already evinced for his reputation, excited on the part of Newton\r\na corresponding feeling, and he gladly accepted of their proposal to\r\npublish his discourse in the monthly numbers in which the Transactions\r\nwere then given to the world. “It was an esteem,” says he,[12] “of the\r\nRoyal Society for most candid and able judges in philosophical matters,\r\nencouraged me to present them with that discourse of light and colours,\r\nwhich since they have so favourably accepted of, I do earnestly desire\r\nyou to return them my cordial thanks. I before thought it a great\r\nfavour to be made a member of that honourable body; but I am now more\r\nsensible of the advantages; for believe me, sir, I do not only esteem\r\nit a duty to concur with you in the promotion of real knowledge; but a\r\ngreat privilege, that, instead of exposing discourses to a prejudiced\r\nand common multitude, (by which means many truths have been baffled and\r\nlost), I may with freedom apply myself to so judicious and impartial\r\nan assembly. As to the printing of that letter, I am satisfied in\r\ntheir judgment, or else I should have thought it too straight and\r\nnarrow for public view. I designed it only to those that know how to\r\nimprove upon hints of things; and, therefore, to spare tediousness,\r\nomitted many such remarks and experiments as might be collected by\r\nconsidering the assigned laws of refractions; some of which I believe,\r\nwith the generality of men, would yet be almost as taking as any I\r\ndescribed. But yet, since the Royal Society have thought it fit to\r\nappear publicly, I leave it to their pleasure: and perhaps to supply\r\nthe aforesaid defects, I may send you some more of the experiments to\r\nsecond it (if it be so thought fit), in the ensuing Transactions.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the order which Newton himself adopted, we have, in the\r\npreceding chapter, given an account of the leading doctrine of the\r\ndifferent refrangibility of light, and of the attempts to improve the\r\nreflecting telescope which that discovery suggested. We shall now,\r\ntherefore, endeavour to make the reader acquainted with the other\r\ndiscoveries respecting colours which he at this time communicated to\r\nthe Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 4._]\r\n\r\nHaving determined, by experiments already described, that a beam of\r\nwhite light, as emitted from the sun, consisted of seven different\r\ncolours, which possess different degrees of refrangibility, he measured\r\nthe relative extent of the coloured spaces, and found them to have\r\nthe proportions shown in _fig. 4_, which represents the _prismatic_\r\nspectrum, and which is nothing more than an elongated image of the sun\r\nproduced by the rays being separated in different degrees from their\r\noriginal direction, the _red_ being refracted _least_, and the _violet\r\nmost_ powerfully.\r\n\r\nIf we consider light as consisting of minute particles of matter,\r\nwe may form some notion of its decomposition by the prism from the\r\nfollowing popular illustration. If we take steel filings of seven\r\ndifferent degrees of fineness and mix them together, there are two ways\r\nin which we may conceive the mass to be decomposed, or, what is the\r\nsame thing, all the seven different kinds of filings separated from\r\neach other. By means of seven sieves of different degrees of fineness,\r\nand so made that the finest will just transmit the finest powder and\r\ndetain all the rest, while the next in fineness transmits the two\r\nfinest powders and detains all the rest, and so on, it is obvious that\r\nall the powders may be completely separated from each other. If we\r\nagain mix all the steel filings, and laying them upon a table, hold\r\nhigh above them a flat bar magnet, so that none of the filings are\r\nattracted, then if we bring the magnet nearer and nearer, we shall come\r\nto a point where the finest filings are drawn up to it. These being\r\nremoved, and the magnet brought nearer still, the next finest powders\r\nwill be attracted, and so on till we have thus drawn out of the mass\r\nall the powders in a separate state. We may conceive the bar magnet to\r\nbe inclined to the surface of the steel filings, and so moved over the\r\nmass, that at the end nearest to them the heaviest or coarsest will\r\nbe attracted, and all the remotest and the finest or lighter filings,\r\nwhile the rest are attracted to intermediate points, so that the seven\r\ndifferent filings are not only separated, but are found adhering in\r\nseparate patches to the surface of the flat magnet. The first of these\r\nmethods, with the sieves, may represent the process of decomposing\r\nlight, by which certain rays of white light are absorbed, or stifled,\r\nor stopped in passing through bodies, while certain other rays are\r\ntransmitted. The second method may represent the process of decomposing\r\nlight by refraction, or by the attraction of certain rays farther from\r\ntheir original direction than other rays, and the different patches of\r\nfilings upon the flat magnet may represent the spaces on the spectrum.\r\n\r\nWhen a beam of white light is decomposed into the seven different\r\ncolours of the spectrum, any particular colour, when once separated\r\nfrom the rest, is not susceptible of any change, or farther\r\ndecomposition, whether it is refracted through prisms or reflected from\r\nmirrors. It may become fainter or brighter, but Newton never could, by\r\nany process, alter its colour or its refrangibility.\r\n\r\nAmong the various bodies which act upon light, it is conceivable\r\nthat there might have been some which acted least upon the violet\r\nrays and most upon the red rays. Newton, however, found that this\r\nnever took place; but that the same degree of refrangibility always\r\nbelonged to the same colour, and the same colour to the same degree of\r\nrefrangibility.\r\n\r\nHaving thus determined that the seven different colours of the spectrum\r\nwere original or simple, he was led to the conclusion that _whiteness_\r\nor white light is a compound of all the seven colours of the spectrum,\r\nin the proportions in which they are represented in _fig. 4_. In order\r\nto prove this, or what is called the recomposition of white light out\r\nof the seven colours, he employed three different methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 5._]\r\n\r\nWhen the beam RR was separated into its elementary colours by the prism\r\nABC, he received the colours on another prism BCB′, held either close\r\nto the first or a little behind it, and by the opposite refraction of\r\nthis prism they were all refracted back into a beam of white light BW,\r\nwhich formed a white circular image on the wall at W, similar to what\r\ntook place before any of the prisms were placed in its way.\r\n\r\nThe other method of recomposing white light consisted in making the\r\nspectrum fall upon a lens at some distance from it. When a sheet of\r\nwhite paper was held behind the lens, and removed to a proper distance,\r\nthe colours were all refracted into a circular spot, and so blended as\r\nto reproduce light so perfectly white as not to differ sensibly from\r\nthe direct light of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe last method of recomposing white light was one more suited to\r\nvulgar apprehension. It consisted in attempting to compound a white by\r\nmixing the coloured powders used by painters. He was aware that such\r\ncolours, from their very nature, could not compose a pure white; but\r\neven this imperfection in the experiment he removed by an ingenious\r\ndevice. He accordingly mixed one part of _red lead_, four parts of\r\n_blue bice_, and a proper proportion of _orpiment_ and _verdigris_.\r\nThis mixture was _dun_, like wood newly cut, or like the human skin. He\r\nnow took one-third of the mixture and rubbed it thickly on the floor\r\nof his room, where the sun shone upon it through the opened casement,\r\nand beside it, in the shadow, he laid a piece of white paper of the\r\nsame size. “Then going from them to the distance of twelve or eighteen\r\nfeet, so that he could not discern the unevenness of the surface of\r\nthe powder nor the little shadows let fall from the gritty particles\r\nthereof; the powder appeared intensely white, so as to transcend even\r\nthe paper itself in whiteness.” By adjusting the relative illumination\r\nof the powders and the paper, he was able to make them both appear of\r\nthe very same degree of whiteness. “For,” says he, “when I was trying\r\nthis, a friend coming to visit me, I stopped him at the door, and\r\nbefore I told him what the colours were, or what I was doing, I asked\r\nhim which of the two whites were the best, and wherein they differed!\r\nAnd after he had at that distance viewed them well, he answered, that\r\nthey were both good whites, and that he could not say which was best,\r\nnor wherein their colours differed.” Hence Newton inferred that perfect\r\nwhiteness may be compounded of different colours.\r\n\r\nAs all the various shades of colour which appear in the material world\r\ncan be imitated by intercepting certain rays in the spectrum, and\r\nuniting all the rest, and as bodies always appear of the same colour\r\nas the light in which they are placed, he concluded, that the colours\r\nof natural bodies are not qualities inherent in the bodies themselves,\r\nbut arise from the disposition of the particles of each body to stop or\r\nabsorb certain rays, and thus to reflect more copiously the rays which\r\nare not thus absorbed.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were these discoveries given to the world than they were\r\nopposed with a degree of virulence and ignorance which have seldom\r\nbeen combined in scientific controversy. Unfortunately for Newton, the\r\nRoyal Society contained few individuals of pre-eminent talent capable\r\nof appreciating the truth of his discoveries, and of protecting him\r\nagainst the shafts of his envious and ignorant assailants. This eminent\r\nbody, while they held his labours in the highest esteem, were still\r\nof opinion that his discoveries were fair subjects of discussion,\r\nand their secretary accordingly communicated to him all the papers\r\nwhich were written in opposition to his views. The first of these\r\nwas by a Jesuit named Ignatius Pardies, Professor of Mathematics at\r\nClermont, who pretended that the elongation of the sun’s image arose\r\nfrom the inequal incidence of the different rays on the first face\r\nof the prism, although Newton had demonstrated in his own discourse\r\nthat this was not the case. In April, 1672, Newton transmitted to\r\nOldenburg a decisive reply to the animadversions of Pardies; but,\r\nunwilling to be vanquished, this disciple of Descartes took up a fresh\r\nposition, and maintained that the elongation of the spectrum might be\r\nexplained by the diffusion of light on the hypothesis of Grimaldi,\r\nor by the diffusion of undulations on the hypothesis of Hook. Newton\r\nagain replied to these feeble reasonings; but he contented himself\r\nwith reiterating his original experiments, and confirming them by more\r\npopular arguments, and the vanquished Jesuit wisely quitted the field.\r\n\r\nAnother combatant soon sprung up in the person of one Francis Linus,\r\na physician in Liege,[13] who, on the 6th October, 1674, addressed a\r\nletter to a friend in London, containing animadversions on Newton’s\r\ndoctrine of colours. He boldly affirms, that in a perfectly clear sky\r\nthe image of the sun made by a prism is never elongated, and that the\r\nspectrum observed by Newton was not formed by the true sunbeams, but by\r\nrays proceeding from some bright cloud. In support of these assertions,\r\nhe appeals to frequently repeated experiments on the refractions and\r\nreflections of light which he had exhibited thirty years before to\r\nSir Kenelm Digby, “who took notes upon them;” and he unblushingly\r\nstates, that, if Newton had used the same industry as he did, he\r\nwould never have “taken so impossible a task in hand, as to explain\r\nthe difference between the length and breadth of the spectrum by the\r\nreceived laws of refraction.” When this letter was shown to Newton, he\r\nrefused to answer it; but a letter was sent to Linus referring him\r\nto the answer to Pardies, and assuring him that the experiments on\r\nthe spectrum were made when there was no bright cloud in the heavens.\r\nThis reply, however, did not satisfy the Dutch experimentalist. On the\r\n25th February, 1675, he addressed another letter to his friend, in\r\nwhich he gravely attempts to prove that the experiment of Newton was\r\nnot made in a clear day;—that the prism was not close to the hole,—and\r\nthat the length of the spectrum was not perpendicular, or parallel to\r\nthe length of the prism. Such assertions could not but irritate even\r\nthe patient mind of Newton. He more than once declined the earnest\r\nrequest of Oldenburg to answer these observations; he stated, that,\r\nas the dispute referred to matters of fact, it could only be decided\r\nbefore competent witnesses, and he referred to the testimony of those\r\nwho had seen his experiments. The entreaties of Oldenburg, however,\r\nprevailed over his own better judgment, and, “lest Mr. Linus should\r\nmake the more stir,” this great man was compelled to draw up a long\r\nand explanatory reply to reasonings utterly contemptible, and to\r\nassertions altogether unfounded. This answer, dated November 13th,\r\n1675, could scarcely have been perused by Linus, who was dead on the\r\n15th December, when his pupil Mr. Gascoigne, took up the gauntlet,\r\nand declared that Linus had shown to various persons in Liege the\r\nexperiment which proved the spectrum to be circular, and that Sir\r\nIsaac could not be more confident on his side than they were on the\r\nother. He admitted, however, that the different results might arise\r\nfrom different ways of placing the prism. Pleased with the “handsome\r\ngenius of Mr. Gascoigne’s letter,” Newton replied even to it, and\r\nsuggested that the spectrum seen by Linus may have been the circular\r\none, formed by one reflexion, or, what he thought more probable, the\r\ncircular one formed by two refractions, and one intervening reflection\r\nfrom the base of the prism, which would be coloured if the prism was\r\nnot an isosceles one. This suggestion seems to have enlightened the\r\nDutch philosophers. Mr. Gascoigne, having no conveniences for making\r\nthe experiments pointed out by Newton, requested Mr. Lucas of Liege to\r\nperform them in his own house. This ingenious individual, whose paper\r\ngave great satisfaction to Newton, and deserves the highest praise,\r\nconfirmed the leading results of the English philosopher; but though\r\nthe refracting angle of his prism was 60° and the refractions equal, he\r\nnever could obtain a spectrum whose length was more than from _three_\r\nto _three and a half_ times its breadth, while Newton found the length\r\nto be _five_ times its breadth. In our author’s reply, he directs his\r\nattention principally to this point of difference. He repeated his\r\nmeasures with each of the three angles of _three_ different prisms, and\r\nhe affirmed that Mr. Lucas might _make sure to find the image as long\r\nor longer than he had yet done_, by taking a prism with plain surfaces,\r\nand with an angle of 66° or 67°. He admitted that the smallness of\r\nthe angle in Mr. Lucas’s prism, viz. 60°, did not account for the\r\nshortness of the spectrum which he obtained with it; and he observed\r\nin one of his own prisms that the length of the image was greater in\r\nproportion to the refracting angle than it should have been; an effect\r\nwhich he ascribes to its having a greater refractive power. There is\r\nevery reason to believe that the prism of Lucas had actually a less\r\ndispersive power than that of Newton; and had the Dutch philosopher\r\nmeasured its refractive power instead of guessing it, or had Newton\r\nbeen less confident than he was[14] that all other prisms must give\r\na spectrum of the same length as his in relation to its refracting\r\nangle and its index of refraction, the invention of the achromatic\r\ntelescope would have been the necessary result. The objections of Lucas\r\ndrove our author to experiments which he had never before made,—to\r\nmeasure accurately the lengths of the spectra with different prisms of\r\ndifferent angles and different refractive powers; and had the Dutch\r\nphilosopher maintained his position with more obstinacy, he would have\r\nconferred a distinguished favour upon science, and would have rewarded\r\nNewton for all the vexation which had sprung from the minute discussion\r\nof his optical experiments.\r\n\r\nSuch was the termination of his disputes with the Dutch philosophers,\r\nand it can scarcely be doubted that it cost him more trouble to detect\r\nthe origin of his adversaries’ blunders, than to establish the great\r\ntruths which they had attempted to overturn.\r\n\r\nHarassing as such a controversy must have been to a philosopher\r\nlike Newton, yet it did not touch those deep-seated feelings which\r\ncharacterize the noble and generous mind. No rival jealousy yet\r\npointed the arguments of his opponents;—no charges of plagiarism were\r\nyet directed against his personal character. These aggravations of\r\nscientific controversy, however, he was destined to endure; and in the\r\ndispute which he was called to maintain both against Hooke and Huygens,\r\nthe agreeable consciousness of grappling with men of kindred powers was\r\npainfully imbittered by the personality and jealousy with which it was\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Hooke was about seven years older than Newton, and was\r\none of the ninety-eight original or unelected members of the Royal\r\nSociety. He possessed great versatility of talent, yet, though his\r\ngenius was of the most original cast, and his acquirements extensive,\r\nhe had not devoted himself with fixed purpose to any particular branch\r\nof knowledge. His numerous and ingenious inventions, of which it\r\nis impossible to speak too highly, gave to his studies a practical\r\nturn which unfitted him for that continuous labour which physical\r\nresearches so imperiously demand. The subjects of light, however, and\r\nof gravitation seem to have deeply occupied his thoughts before Newton\r\nappeared in the same field, and there can be no doubt that he had made\r\nconsiderable progress in both of these inquiries. With a mind less\r\ndivergent in its pursuits, and more endowed with patience of thought,\r\nhe might have unveiled the mysteries in which both these subjects were\r\nenveloped, and preoccupied the intellectual throne which was destined\r\nfor his rival; but the infirm state of his health, the peevishness\r\nof temper which this occasioned, the number of unfinished inventions\r\nfrom which he looked both for fortune and fame, and, above all, his\r\ninordinate love of reputation, distracted and broke down the energies\r\nof his powerful intellect. In the more matured inquiries of his rivals\r\nhe recognised, and often truly, his own incompleted speculations; and\r\nwhen he saw others reaping the harvest for which he had prepared the\r\nground, and of which he had sown the seeds, it was not easy to suppress\r\nthe mortification which their success inspired. In the history of\r\nscience, it has always been a difficult task to adjust the rival claims\r\nof competitors, when the one was allowed to have completed what the\r\nother was acknowledged to have begun. He who commences an inquiry, and\r\npublishes his results, often goes much farther than he has announced\r\nto the world, and, pushing his speculations into the very heart of the\r\nsubject, frequently submits them to the ear of friendship. From the\r\npedestal of his published labours his rival begins his researches,\r\nand brings them to a successful issue; while he has in reality done\r\nnothing more than complete and demonstrate the imperfect speculations\r\nof his predecessor. To the world, and to himself, he is no doubt in the\r\nposition of the principal discoverer: but there is still some apology\r\nfor his rival when he brings forward his unpublished labours; and some\r\nexcuse for the exercise of personal feeling, when he measures the speed\r\nof his rival by his own proximity to the goal.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Dr. Hooke would have been viewed with some such feeling,\r\nhad not his arrogance on other occasions checked the natural current\r\nof our sympathy. When Newton presented his reflecting telescope to\r\nthe Royal Society, Dr. Hooke not only criticised the instrument with\r\nundue severity, but announced that he possessed an infallible method of\r\nperfecting all kinds of optical instruments, so that “whatever almost\r\nhath been in notion and imagination, or desired in optics, may be\r\nperformed with great facility and truth.”\r\n\r\nHooke had been strongly impressed with the belief, that light\r\nconsisted in the undulations of a highly elastic medium pervading\r\nall bodies; and, guided by his experimental investigation of the\r\nphenomena of diffraction, he had even announced the great _principle\r\nof interference_, which has performed such an important part in\r\nmodern science. Regarding himself, therefore, as in possession of\r\nthe true theory of light, he examined the discoveries of Newton in\r\ntheir relation to his own speculative views, and, finding that their\r\nauthor was disposed to consider that element as consisting of material\r\nparticles, he did not scruple to reject doctrines which he believed to\r\nbe incompatible with truth. Dr. Hooke was too accurate an observer not\r\nto admit the general correctness of Newton’s observations. He allowed\r\nthe existence of different refractions, the unchangeableness of the\r\nsimple colours, and the production of white light by the union of all\r\nthe colours of the spectrum; but he maintained that the different\r\nrefractions arose from the splitting and rarefying of ethereal pulses,\r\nand that there are only two colours in nature, viz. _red_ and _violet_,\r\nwhich produce by their mixture all the rest, and which are themselves\r\nformed by the two sides of a split pulse or undulation.\r\n\r\nIn reply to these observations, Newton wrote an able letter to\r\nOldenburg, dated June 11, 1672, in which he examined with great\r\nboldness and force of argument the various objections of his opponent,\r\nand maintained the truth of his doctrine of colours, as independent of\r\nthe two hypotheses respecting the origin and production of light. He\r\nacknowledged his own partiality to the doctrine of the materiality of\r\nlight; he pointed out the defects of the undulatory theory; he brought\r\nforward new experiments in confirmation of his former results; and he\r\nrefuted the opinions of Hooke respecting the existence of only two\r\nsimple colours. No reply was made to the powerful arguments of Newton;\r\nand Hooke contented himself with laying before the Society his curious\r\nobservations on the colours of soap-bubbles, and of plates of air, and\r\nin pursuing his experiments on the diffraction of light, which, after\r\nan interval of two years, he laid before the same body.\r\n\r\nAfter he had thus silenced the most powerful of his adversaries, Newton\r\nwas again called upon to defend himself against a new enemy. Christian\r\nHuygens, an eminent mathematician and natural philosopher, who, like\r\nHooke, had maintained the undulatory theory of light, transmitted\r\nto Oldenburg various animadversions on the Newtonian doctrine; but\r\nthough his knowledge of optics was of the most extensive kind, yet his\r\nobjections were nearly as groundless as those of his less enlightened\r\ncountryman. Attached to his own hypothesis respecting the nature\r\nof light, namely, to the system of undulation, he seems, like Dr.\r\nHooke, to have regarded the discoveries of Newton as calculated to\r\noverturn it; but his principal objections related to the composition\r\nof colours, and particularly of white light, which he alleged could be\r\nobtained from the union of two colours, _yellow_ and _blue_. To and\r\nsimilar objections, Newton replied that the colours in question were\r\nnot simple yellows and blues, but were compound colours, in which,\r\ntogether, all the colours of the spectrum were themselves blended;\r\nand though he evinced some strong traces of feeling at being again\r\nput upon his defence, yet his high respect for Huygens induced him to\r\nenter with patience on a fresh development of his doctrine. Huygens\r\nfelt the reproof which the tone of this answer so gently conveyed,\r\nand in writing to Oldenburg, he used the expression, that Mr. Newton\r\n“maintained his doctrine with some concern.” To this our author\r\nreplied, “As for Mr. Huygens’s expression, I confess it was a little\r\nungrateful to me, to meet with objections which had been answered\r\nbefore, without having the least reason given me why those answers\r\nwere insufficient.” But though Huygens appears in this controversy as\r\na rash objector to the Newtonian doctrine, it was afterward the fate\r\nof Newton to play a similar part against the Dutch philosopher. When\r\nHuygens published his beautiful law of double refraction in Iceland\r\nspar, founded on the finest experimental analysis of the phenomena,\r\nthough presented as a result of the undulatory system, Newton not only\r\nrejected it, but substituted for it another law entirely inconsistent\r\nwith the experiments of Huygens, which Newton himself had praised, and\r\nwith those of all succeeding philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe influence of these controversies on the mind of Newton seems to\r\nhave been highly exciting. Even the satisfaction of humbling all\r\nhis antagonists he did not feel as a sufficient compensation for the\r\ndisturbance of his tranquillity. “I intend,” says he,[15] “to be no\r\nfarther solicitous about matters of philosophy. And therefore I hope\r\nyou will not take it ill if you find me never doing any thing more in\r\nthat kind; or rather that you will favour me in my determination, by\r\npreventing, so far as you can conveniently, any objections or other\r\nphilosophical letters that may concern me.” In a subsequent letter in\r\n1675, he says, “I had some thoughts of writing a further discourse\r\nabout colours, to be read at one of your assemblies; but find it yet\r\nagainst the grain to put pen to paper any more on that subject;” and\r\nin a letter to Leibnitz, dated December the 9th, 1675, he observes, “I\r\nwas so persecuted with discussions arising from the publication of my\r\ntheory of light, that I blamed my own imprudence for parting with so\r\nsubstantial a blessing as my quiet to run after a shadow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  _Mistake of Newton in supposing that the Improvement of Refracting\r\n    Telescopes was hopeless—Mr. Hall invents the Achromatic Telescope—\r\n    Principles of the Achromatic Telescope explained—It is re-invented\r\n    by Dollond, and improved by future Artists—Dr. Blair’s Aplanatic\r\n    Telescope—Mistakes in Newton’s Analysis of the Spectrum—Modern\r\n    Discoveries respecting the Structure of the Spectrum._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new doctrines of the composition of light, and of the different\r\nrefrangibility of the rays which compose it, having been thus\r\nestablished upon an impregnable basis, it will be interesting to take a\r\ngeneral view of the changes which they have undergone since the time\r\nof Newton, and of their influence on the progress of optical discovery.\r\n\r\nThere is no fact in the history of science more singular than that\r\nNewton should have believed that all bodies produced spectra of equal\r\nlength, or separated the red and violet rays to equal distances when\r\nthe refraction of the mean rays was the same. This opinion, unsupported\r\nby experiments, and not even sanctioned by any theoretical views,\r\nseems to have been impressed upon his mind with all the force of an\r\naxiom.[16] Even the shortness of the spectrum observed by Lucas did\r\nnot rouse him to further inquiry; and when, under the influence of\r\nthis blind conviction he pronounced the improvement of the refracting\r\ntelescope to be desperate, he checked for a long time the progress of\r\nthis branch of science, and furnished to future philosophers a lesson\r\nwhich cannot be too deeply studied.\r\n\r\nIn 1729, about two years after the death of Sir Isaac, an individual\r\nunknown to science broke the spell in which the subject of the spectrum\r\nhad been so singularly bound. Mr. Chester More Hall, of More Hall\r\nin Essex, while studying the mechanism of the human eye, was led to\r\nsuppose that telescopes might be improved by a combination of lenses\r\nof different refractive powers, and he actually completed several\r\nobject-glasses upon this principle. The steps by which he arrived at\r\nsuch a construction have not been recorded; but it is obvious that\r\nhe must have discovered what escaped the sagacity of Newton, that\r\nprisms made of different kinds of glass produced different degrees of\r\nseparation of the _red_ and _violet_ rays, or gave spectra of different\r\nlengths when the refraction of the middle ray of the spectrum was the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 6._]\r\n\r\nIn order to explain how such a property led him to the construction\r\nof a _telescope without colour_, or an _achromatic telescope_, let us\r\ntake a lens LL of _crown_ or _plate_ glass, whose focal length LY is\r\nabout twelve inches. When the sun’s rays SL, SL fall upon it, the _red_\r\nwill be refracted to R, the _yellow_ to Y, and the _violet_ to V. If we\r\nnow place behind it a concave lens _ll_ of the same glass, and of the\r\nsame focus or curvature, it will be found, both by experiment and by\r\ndrawing the refracted rays, according to the rules given in elementary\r\nworks, that the concave glass _ll_ will refract the rays LR, LR into\r\nLS′, LS′, and the rays LV, LV into LS′, LS′ free of all colour; but as\r\nthese rays will be parallel, the two lenses will not have a focus, and\r\nconsequently cannot form an image so as to be used as the object-glass\r\nof a telescope. This is obvious from another consideration; for since\r\nthe curvatures of the convex and concave lenses are the same, the two\r\nput together will be exactly the same as if they were formed out of a\r\nsingle piece of glass, having parallel surfaces like a watch-glass,\r\nso that the parallel rays of light SL, SL will pass on in the same\r\ndirection LS′, LS′ affected by equal and opposite refractions as in a\r\npiece of plane glass.\r\n\r\nNow, since the convex lens LL separated the white light SL, SL into\r\nits component coloured rays, LV, LV being the extreme violet, and LR,\r\nLR the extreme red; it follows that a similar concave lens of the same\r\nglass is capable of uniting into white light LS′, LS′ rays, as much\r\nseparated as LV, LR are. Consequently, if we take a concave lens _ll_\r\nof the same, or of a greater refractive power than the convex one, and\r\nhaving the power of uniting rays farther separated than LV, LR are, a\r\nless concavity in the lens _ll_ will be sufficient to unite the rays\r\nLV, LR into a white ray LS′; but as the lens _ll_ is now less concave\r\nthan the lens LL is convex, the concavity will predominate, and the\r\nuncoloured rays LS′, LS′ will no longer be parallel, but will converge\r\nto some point O, where they will form a colourless or achromatic image\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nThe effect now described may be obtained by making the _convex_ lens LL\r\nof _crown_ or of _plate_ glass, and the _concave_ one of _flint_ glass,\r\nor that of which wineglasses are made. If the concave lens _ll_ has a\r\ngreater refractive power than LL, which is always the case, the only\r\neffect of it will be to make the rays converge to a focus more remote\r\nthan O, or to render a less curvature necessary in _ll_, if O is fixed\r\nfor the focus of the combined lenses.\r\n\r\nSuch is the principle of the achromatic telescope as constructed by Mr.\r\nHall. This ingenious individual employed working opticians to grind\r\nhis lenses, and he furnished them with the radii of the surfaces,\r\nwhich were adjusted to correct the aberration of figure as well as of\r\ncolour. His invention, therefore, was not an accidental combination of\r\na convex and a concave lens of different kinds of glass, which might\r\nhave been made merely for experiment; but it was a complete achromatic\r\ntelescope, founded on a thorough knowledge of the different dispersive\r\npowers of crown and flint glass. It is a curious circumstance,\r\nhowever, in the history of the telescope, that this invention was\r\nactually lost. Mr. Hall never published any account of his labours,\r\nand it is probable that he kept them secret till he should be able to\r\npresent his instrument to the public in a more perfect form; and it\r\nwas not till John Dollond had discovered the property of light upon\r\nwhich the instrument depends, and had actually constructed many fine\r\ntelescopes, that the previous labours of Mr. Hall were laid before the\r\npublic.[17] From this period the achromatic telescope underwent gradual\r\nimprovement, and by the successive labours of Dollond, Ramsden, Blair,\r\nTulley, Guinand, Lerebours, and Fraunhofer, it has become one of the\r\nmost valuable instruments in physical science.\r\n\r\nAlthough the achromatic telescope, as constructed by Dollond, was\r\nfounded on the principle that the spectra formed by crown and flint\r\nglass differed only in their relative lengths, when the refraction of\r\nthe mean ray was the same, yet by a more minute examination of the\r\nbest instruments, it was found that they exhibited white or luminous\r\nobjects tinged on one side with a green fringe, and on the other with\r\none of a claret colour. These colours, which did not arise from any\r\ndefect of skill in the artist, were found to arise from a difference in\r\nthe extent of the coloured spaces in two equal spectra formed by crown\r\nand by flint glass. This property was called the _irrationality_ of\r\nthe coloured spaces, and the uncorrected colours which remained when\r\nthe primary spectrum of the crown glass was corrected by the primary\r\nspectrum of the flint glass were called the _secondary_ or _residual\r\nspectrum_. By a happy contrivance, which it would be out of place here\r\nto describe, Dr. Blair succeeded in correcting this secondary spectrum,\r\nor in removing the green and claret-coloured fringes which appeared in\r\nthe best telescopes, and to this contrivance he gave the name of the\r\n_Aplanatic Telescope_.\r\n\r\nBut while Newton thus overlooked these remarkable properties of the\r\nprismatic spectrum, as formed by different bodies, he committed some\r\nconsiderable mistakes in his examination of the spectrum which was\r\nunder his own immediate examination. It does not seem to have occurred\r\nto him that the relations of the coloured spaces must be greatly\r\nmodified by the angular magnitude of the sun or the luminous body, or\r\naperture from which the spectrum is obtained; and misled by an apparent\r\nanalogy between the length of the coloured spaces and the divisions\r\nof a musical chord,[18] he adopted the latter, as representing the\r\nproportion of the coloured spaces in every beam of white light. Had two\r\nother observers, one situated in Mercury, and the other in Jupiter,\r\nstudied the prismatic spectrum of the sun by the same instruments,\r\nand with the same sagacity as Newton, it is demonstrable that they\r\nwould have obtained very different results. On account of the apparent\r\nmagnitude of the sun in Mercury, the observer there would obtain a\r\nspectrum entirely without _green_, having _red_, _orange_, and _yellow_\r\nat one end, the _white_ in the middle, and terminated at the other\r\nend with _blue_ and _violet_. The observer in Jupiter would, on the\r\ncontrary, have obtained a spectrum in which the colours were much more\r\ncondensed. On the planet Saturn a spectrum exactly similar would have\r\nbeen obtained, notwithstanding the greater diminution of the sun’s\r\napparent diameter. It may now be asked, which of all these spectra are\r\nwe to consider as exhibiting the number, and arrangement, and extent\r\nof the coloured spaces proper to be adopted as the true analysis of a\r\nsolar ray.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum observed by Newton has surely no claim to our notice,\r\nmerely because it was observed upon the surface of the earth. The\r\nspectrum obtained in Mercury affords no analysis at all of the incident\r\nbeam, the colours being almost all compound, and not homogeneous, and\r\nthat of Newton is liable to the same objection. Had Newton examined his\r\nspectrum under the very same circumstances in winter and in summer, he\r\nwould have found the analysis of the beam more complete in summer, on\r\naccount of the diminution of the sun’s diameter; and, therefore, we are\r\nentitled to say that neither the number nor the extent of the coloured\r\nspaces, as given by Newton, are those which belong to homogeneous and\r\nuncompounded light.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum obtained in Jupiter and Saturn is the only one where\r\nthe analysis is complete, as it is incapable of having its character\r\naltered by any farther diminution of the sun’s diameter. Hence we\r\nare forced to conclude, not only that the number and extent of the\r\nprimitive homogeneous colours, as given by Newton, are incorrect; but\r\nthat if he had attempted to analyze some of the primitive tints in the\r\nspectrum, he would have found them decidedly composed of heterogeneous\r\nrays. There is one consequence of these observations which is somewhat\r\ninteresting. A rainbow formed in summer, when the sun’s diameter is\r\nleast, must have its colours more condensed and homogeneous than in\r\nwinter, when the size of its disk is a maximum, and when the upper or\r\nthe under limb of the sun is eclipsed, a rainbow formed at that time\r\nwill lose entirely the yellow rays, and have the green and the red in\r\nperfect contact. For the same reason, a rainbow formed in Venus and\r\nMercury will be destitute of green rays, and have a brilliant bow of\r\nwhite light separating two coloured arches; while in Mars, Jupiter,\r\nSaturn, and the Georgian planet, the bow will exhibit only four\r\nhomogeneous colours.\r\n\r\nFrom his analysis of the solar spectrum, Newton concluded, “that to\r\nthe same degree of refrangibility ever belonged the same colour, and\r\nto the same colour ever belonged the same degree of refrangibility;”\r\nand hence he inferred, that _red_, _orange_, _yellow_, _green_, _blue_,\r\n_indigo_, and _violet_ were primary and simple colours. He admitted,\r\nindeed, that “the same colours in specie with these primary ones may\r\nbe also produced by composition. For a mixture of _yellow_ and _blue_\r\nmakes _green_, and of _red_ and _yellow_ makes _orange_;” but such\r\ncompound colours were easily distinguished from the simple colours of\r\nthe spectrum by the circumstance, that they are always capable of being\r\nresolved by the action of the prism into the two colours which compose\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis view of the composition of the spectrum might have long remained\r\nunchallenged, had we not been able to apply to it a new mode of\r\nanalysis. Though we cannot separate the _green_ rays of the spectrum\r\ninto _yellow_ and _blue_ by the refraction of prisms, yet if we\r\npossessed any substance which had a specific attraction for _blue_\r\nrays, and which stopped them in their course, and allowed the _yellow_\r\nrays to pass, we should thus analyze the _green_ as effectually as\r\nif they were separated by refraction. The substance which possesses\r\nthis property is a purplish blue glass, similar to that of which\r\nfinger-glasses are made. When we view through a piece of this glass,\r\nabout the twentieth of an inch thick, a brilliant prismatic spectrum,\r\nwe find that it has exercised a most extraordinary absorptive action\r\non the different colours which compose it. The _red_ part of the\r\nspectrum is divided into _two red_ spaces, separated by an interval\r\nentirely devoid of light. Next to the inner red space comes a space\r\nof bright _yellow_, separated from the red by a visible interval.\r\nAfter the yellow comes the _green_, with an obscure space between\r\nthem, then follows the _blue_ and the _violet_, the last of which has\r\nsuffered little or no diminution. Now it is very obvious, that in this\r\nexperiment, the blue glass has actually absorbed the _red_ rays, which,\r\nwhen mixed with the _yellow_ on one side, constituted _orange_, and the\r\n_blue_ rays, which, when mixed with the _yellow_ on the other side,\r\nconstituted _green_, so that the insulation of the _yellow_ rays thus\r\neffected, and the disappearance of the _orange_, and of the greater\r\npart of the _green_ light, proves beyond a doubt that the _orange_\r\nand _green_ colours in the spectrum are compound colours, the former\r\nconsisting of _red_ and _yellow_ rays, and the latter of _yellow_ and\r\n_blue_ rays _of the very same refrangibility_. If we compare the two\r\nred spaces of the spectrum seen through the blue glass with the red\r\nspace seen without the blue glass, it will be obvious that the red\r\nhas experienced such an alteration in its tint by the action of the\r\nblue glass, as would be effected by the absorption of a small portion\r\nof yellow rays; and hence we conclude, that the red of the spectrum\r\ncontains a slight tinge of yellow, and that the yellow space extends\r\nover more than one-half of the spectrum, including the _red_, _orange_,\r\n_yellow_, _green_, and _blue_ spaces.\r\n\r\nI have found also that red light exists in the yellow space, and it\r\nis certain that in the violet space red light exists in a state of\r\ncombination with the blue rays. From these and other facts which it\r\nwould be out of place here to explain, I conclude that the prismatic\r\nspectrum consists of three different spectra, viz. red, yellow, and\r\nblue, all having the same length, and all overlapping each other. Hence\r\nred, yellow, and blue rays of the very same refrangibility coexist at\r\nevery point of the spectrum; but the colour at any one point will be\r\nthat of the predominant ray, and will depend upon the relative distance\r\nof the point from the maximum ordinate of the curve which represents\r\nthe intensity of the light of each of the three spectra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 7._]\r\n\r\nThis structure of the spectrum, which harmonizes with the old\r\nhypothesis of three simple colours, will be understood from the annexed\r\ndiagram, where MN is the spectrum of seven colours, all compounded of\r\nthe three simple ones, _red_, _yellow_, and _blue_. The ordinates of\r\nthe curves R, Y, and B will express the intensities of each colour\r\nat different points of the spectrum. At the red extremity M of the\r\nspectrum, the pure _red_ is scarcely altered by the very slight\r\nintermixture of yellow and blue. Farther on in the red space, the\r\n_yellow_ begins to make the red incline to scarlet. It then exists\r\nin sufficient quantity to form orange, and, as the red declines, the\r\nyellow predominates over the feeble portion of red and blue which are\r\nmixed with it. As the yellow decreases in intensity, the increasing\r\nblue forms with it a good green, and the blue rising to its maximum\r\nspeedily overpowers the small portion of yellow and red. When the blue\r\nbecomes very faint, the red exhibits its influence in converting it\r\ninto violet, and the yellow ceases to exercise a marked influence on\r\nthe tint. The influence of the red over the blue space is scarcely\r\nperceptible, on account of the great intensity of the blue light; but\r\nwe may easily conceive it to reappear and form the violet light, not\r\nonly from the rapid decline of the blue light, but from the greater\r\ninfluence of the red rays upon the retina.\r\n\r\nThese views may, perhaps, be more clearly understood by supposing that\r\na certain portion of white light is actually formed at every point of\r\nthe spectrum by the union of the requisite number of the three coloured\r\nrays that exist at any point. The white light thus formed will add to\r\nthe brilliancy without affecting the tint of the predominant colour.\r\n\r\nIn the violet space we may conceive the small portion of yellow which\r\nexists there to form white light with a part of the blue and a part\r\nof the red, so that the resulting tint will be violet, composed of\r\nthe blue and the small remaining portion of red, mixed with the white\r\nlight. This white light will possess the remarkable property of not\r\nbeing susceptible of decomposition by the analysis of the prism,\r\nas it is composed of red, yellow, and blue rays of the very same\r\nrefrangibility. The insulation of this white light by the absorption\r\nof the predominant colours I have effected in the green, yellow, and\r\nred spaces, and by the use of new absorbing media we may yet hope to\r\nexhibit it in some of the other colours, particularly in the brightest\r\npart of the blue space, where an obvious approximation to it takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important modern discoveries respecting the spectrum\r\nwe must enumerate that of fixed dark and coloured lines, which we owe\r\nto the sagacity of Dr. Wollaston and M. Fraunhofer. Two or three of\r\nthese lines were discovered by Dr. Wollaston, but nearly 600 have been\r\ndetected by means of the fine prisms and the magnificent apparatus\r\nof the Bavarian optician. These lines are parallel to one another,\r\nand perpendicular to the length of the spectrum. The largest occupy a\r\nspace from 5″ to 10″ in breadth. Sometimes they occur in well-defined\r\nlines, and at other times in groups; and in all spectra formed from\r\nsolar light, they preserve the same order and intensity, and the same\r\nrelative position to the coloured spaces, whatever be the nature of the\r\nprism by which they are produced. Hence these lines are fixed points,\r\nby which the relative dispersive powers of different media may be\r\nascertained with a degree of accuracy hitherto unknown in this branch\r\nof science. In the light of the fixed stars, and in that of artificial\r\nflames, a different system of lines is produced, and this system\r\nremains unaltered, whatever be the nature of the prism by which the\r\nspectrum is formed.\r\n\r\nThe most important fixed lines in the spectrum formed by light emitted\r\nfrom the sun, whether it is reflected from the sky, the clouds, or\r\nthe moon, may be easily seen by looking at a narrow slit in the\r\nwindow-shutter of a dark room, through a hollow prism formed of\r\nplates of parallel glass, and filled with any fluid of a considerable\r\ndispersive power. The slit should not greatly exceed the twentieth of\r\nan inch, and the eye should look through the thinnest edge of the prism\r\nwhere there is the least thickness of fluid. These lines I have found\r\nto be the boundaries of spaces within which the rays have particular\r\naffinities for particular bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  _Colours of thin Plates first studied by Boyle and Hooke—Newton\r\n    determines the Law of their Production—His Theory of Fits of Easy\r\n    Reflection and Transmission—Colours of thick Plates._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn examining the nature and origin of colours as the component parts\r\nof white light, the attention of Newton was directed to the curious\r\nsubject of the colours of thin plates, and to its application to\r\nexplain the colours of natural bodies. His earliest researches on this\r\nsubject were communicated, in his Discourse on Light and Colours,\r\nto the Royal Society, on the 9th December, 1675, and were read at\r\nsubsequent meetings of that body. This discourse contained fuller\r\ndetails respecting the composition and decomposition of light than\r\nhe had given in his letter to Oldenburg, and was concluded with nine\r\npropositions, showing how the colours of thin transparent plates stand\r\nrelated to those of all natural bodies.\r\n\r\nThe colours of thin plates seem to have been first observed by Mr.\r\nBoyle. Dr. Hooke afterward studied them with some care, and gave a\r\ncorrect account of the leading phenomena, as exhibited in the coloured\r\nrings upon soap-bubbles, and between plates of glass pressed together.\r\nHe recognised that the colour depended upon some certain thickness of\r\nthe transparent plate, but he acknowledges that he had attempted in\r\nvain to discover the relation between the thickness of the plate and\r\nthe colour which it produced.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooke succeeded in splitting a mineral substance, called mica,\r\ninto films of such extreme thinness as to give brilliant colours. One\r\nplate, for example, gave a yellow colour, another a blue colour, and\r\nthe two together a deep purple; but, as plates which produced those\r\ncolours were always less than the 12,000th part of an inch thick,\r\nit was quite impracticable, by any contrivance yet discovered, to\r\nmeasure their thickness, and determine the law according to which the\r\ncolour varied with the thickness of the film. Newton surmounted this\r\ndifficulty by laying a double convex lens, the radius of curvature\r\nof each side of which was fifty feet, upon the flat surface of a\r\nplano-convex object-glass, and in this way he obtained a plate of air\r\nor of space varying from the thinnest possible edge at the centre of\r\nthe object-glass where it touched the plane surface, to a considerable\r\nthickness at the circumference of the lens. When light was allowed to\r\nfall upon the object-glass, every different thickness of the plate\r\nof air between the object-glass gave different colours, so that the\r\npoint where the two object-glasses touched one another was the centre\r\nof a number of concentric coloured rings. Now, as the curvature of\r\nthe object-glass was known, it was easy to calculate the thickness of\r\nthe plate of air at which any particular colour appeared, and thus to\r\ndetermine the law of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how he proceeded, let CED be the convex surface\r\nof the one object-glass, and AEB the flat surface of the other. Let\r\nthem touch at the point E, and let homogeneous _red_ rays fall upon\r\nthem, as shown in the figure. At the point of contact E, where the\r\nplate of air is inconceivably thin, not a single ray of the pencil RE\r\nis reflected. The light is wholly transmitted, and, consequently, to\r\nan eye above E, there will appear at E a black spot. At _a_, where\r\nthe plate of air is thicker, the red light _ra_ is reflected in the\r\ndirection _aa′_, and as the air has the same thickness in a circle\r\nround the point E, the eye above E, at _a_, will see next the black\r\nspot E a ring of red light. At _m_, where the thickness of the air is\r\na little greater than at _a_, the light _r′m_ is all transmitted as at\r\nE, and not a single ray suffers reflection, so that to an eye above E\r\nat _m′_ there will be seen without the red ring _a_ a dark ring _m_.\r\nIn like manner, at greater thicknesses of the plate of air, there is a\r\nsuccession of _red_ and dark rings, diminishing in breadth as shown in\r\nthe diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 8._]\r\n\r\nWhen the same experiment was repeated in _orange_, _yellow_, _green_,\r\n_blue_, _indigo_, and _violet_ light, the very same phenomenon was\r\nobserved; with this difference only, that the rings were _largest_ in\r\n_red_ light, and _smallest_ in _violet_ light, and had intermediate\r\nmagnitudes in the intermediate colours.\r\n\r\nIf the observer now places his eye below E, so as to see the\r\ntransmitted rays, he will observe a set of rings as before, but they\r\nwill have a bright spot in their centre at E, and the luminous rings\r\nwill now correspond with those which were dark when seen by reflection,\r\nas will be readily understood from inspecting the preceding diagram.\r\n\r\nWhen the object-glasses are illuminated by _white_ light, the _seven_\r\nsystems of rings, formed by all the _seven_ colours which compose white\r\nlight, will now be seen at once. Had the rings in each colour been all\r\nof the same diameter they would all have formed brilliant white rings,\r\nseparated by dark intervals; but, as they have all different diameters,\r\nthey will overlap one another, producing rings of various colours by\r\ntheir mixture. These colours, reckoning from the centre E, are as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n1st Order. Black, blue, white, yellow, orange, red.\r\n\r\n2d Order. Violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.\r\n\r\n3d Order. Purple, blue, green, yellow, red, bluish-red.\r\n\r\n4th Order. Bluish-green, green, yellowish-green, red.\r\n\r\n5th Order. Greenish-blue, red.\r\n\r\n6th Order. Greenish-blue, red.\r\n\r\nBy accurate measurements, Sir Isaac found that the thicknesses of _air_\r\nat which the most luminous parts of the first rings were produced, were\r\nin parts of an inch 1/178000, 3/178000, 5/178000, 7/178000, 9/178000,\r\n11/178000. If the medium or the substance of the thin plate is water,\r\nas in the case of the soap-bubble, which produces beautiful colours\r\naccording to its different degrees of thinness, the thicknesses at\r\nwhich the most luminous parts of the rings appear are produced at\r\n1/1·336 of the thickness at which they are produced in air, and in the\r\ncase of glass or mica at 1/1·525 of that thickness; the numbers 1.336,\r\n1.525 expressing the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and\r\nrefraction in the substances which produce the colours.\r\n\r\nFrom the phenomena thus briefly described, Sir Isaac Newton deduces\r\nthat ingenious, though hypothetical, property of light, called its\r\n_fits of easy reflection and transmission_. This property consists in\r\nsupposing that every particle of light from its first discharge from\r\na luminous body possesses, at equally distant intervals, dispositions\r\nto be reflected from, and transmitted through, the surfaces of bodies\r\nupon which it is incident. Hence, if a particle of light reaches a\r\nreflecting surface of glass when it is in its _fit of reflection_,\r\nor in its disposition to be reflected, it will yield more readily\r\nto the reflecting force of the surface; and, on the contrary, if it\r\nreaches the same surface while in a _fit of easy transmission_, or in\r\na disposition to be transmitted, it will yield with more difficulty to\r\nthe reflecting force. Sir Isaac has not ventured to inquire into the\r\ncause of this property; but we may form a very intelligible idea of\r\nit by supposing, that the particles of light have two attractive and\r\ntwo repulsive poles at the extremities of two axes at right angles to\r\neach other, and that the particles revolve round their axes, and at\r\nequidistant intervals bring one or other of these axes into the line\r\nof the direction in which the particle is moving. If the attractive\r\naxis is in the line of the direction in which the particle moves when\r\nit reaches the refracting surface, the particle will yield to the\r\nattractive force of the medium, and be refracted and transmitted; but\r\nif the repulsive axis is in the direction of the particle’s motion when\r\nit reaches the surface, it will yield to the repulsive force of the\r\nmedium, and be reflected from it.\r\n\r\nThe application of the theory of alternate fits of reflection and\r\ntransmission to explain the colours of thin plates is very simple.\r\nWhen the light falls upon the first surface AB, Fig. 8 of the plate of\r\nair between AB and CED, the rays that are in a fit of reflection are\r\nreflected, and those that are in a fit of transmission are transmitted.\r\nLet us call F the length of a fit, or the distance through which the\r\nparticle of light moves while it passes from the state of being in\r\na fit of reflection to the state of being in a fit of transmission.\r\nNow, as all the particles of light transmitted through AB were in a\r\nstate of easy transmission when they entered AB, it is obvious, that,\r\nif the plate of air at E is so thin as to be less than one-half of\r\nF, the particles of light will still be in their disposition to be\r\ntransmitted, and consequently the light will be all transmitted, and\r\nnone reflected at the curve surface at E. When the plate becomes\r\nthicker towards _a_, so that its thickness exceeds half of F, the\r\nlight will not reach the surface CE till it has come under its fit of\r\nreflection, and consequently at _a_ the light will be all reflected,\r\nand none transmitted. As the thickness increases towards _m_, the\r\nlight will have come under its fit of transmission, and so on, the\r\nlight being reflected at _a_, _l_, and transmitted at E, _m_. This\r\nwill perhaps be still more easily understood from _fig. 9_, where we\r\nmay suppose AEC to be a thin wedge of glass or any other transparent\r\nbody. When light is incident on the first surface AE, all the particles\r\nof it that are in a fit of easy reflection will be reflected, and all\r\nthose in a fit of easy transmission will be transmitted. As the fits of\r\ntransmission all commence at AE, let the first fit of transmission end\r\nwhen the particles of light have reached _ab_, and the second when they\r\nhave reached _ef_; and let the fits of reflection commence at _cd_ and\r\n_gh_. Then, as the fit of transmission continues from AE to _ab_, all\r\nthe light that falls upon the portion _m_E of the second surface will\r\nbe transmitted and none reflected, so that to an eye above E the space\r\n_m_E will appear black. As the fit of reflection commences at _ab_,\r\nand continues to _cd_, all the light which falls upon the portion _nm_\r\nwill be reflected, and none transmitted; and so on, the light being\r\ntransmitted at _m_E and _pn_, and reflected at _nm_ and _qp_. Hence to\r\nan eye above E the wedge-shaped film of which AEC is a section will\r\nbe covered with parallel bands or fringes of light separated by dark\r\nfringes of the same breadth, and they will be all parallel to the thin\r\nedge of the plate, a dark fringe corresponding to the thinnest edge.\r\nTo an eye placed below CE, similar fringes will be seen, but the one\r\ncorresponding to the thinnest edge _m_E will be luminous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 9._]\r\n\r\nIf the thickness of the plate does not vary according to a regular law\r\nas in _fig. 9_, but if, like a film of blown glass, it has numerous\r\ninequalities, then the alternate fringes of light and darkness will\r\nvary with the thickness of the film, and throughout the whole length of\r\neach fringe the thickness of the film will be the same.\r\n\r\nWe have supposed in the preceding illustration that the light employed\r\nis homogeneous. If it is white, then the differently coloured fringes\r\nwill form by their superposition a system of fringes analogous to those\r\nseen between two object-glasses, as already explained.\r\n\r\nThe same periodical colours which we have now described as exhibited\r\nby thin plates were discovered by Newton in thick plates, and he has\r\nexplained them by means of the theory of fits; but it would lead\r\nus beyond the limits of a popular work like this to enter into any\r\ndetails of his observations, or to give an account of the numerous and\r\nimportant additions which this branch of optics has received from the\r\ndiscoveries of succeeding authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  _Newton’s Theory of the Colours of Natural Bodies explained—Objections\r\n    to it stated—New Classification of Colours—Outline of a New Theory\r\n    proposed._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the objects of the material world had been illuminated with white\r\nlight, all the particles of which possessed the same degree of\r\nrefrangibility, and were equally acted upon by the bodies on which\r\nthey fall, all nature would have shone with a leaden hue, and all the\r\ncombinations of external objects, and all the features of the human\r\ncountenance, would have exhibited no other variety but that which\r\nthey possess in a pencil sketch or a China-ink drawing. The rainbow\r\nitself would have dwindled into a narrow arch of white light,—the\r\nstars would have shone through a gray sky,—and the mantle of a wintry\r\ntwilight would have replaced the golden vesture of the rising and the\r\nsetting sun. But He who has exhibited such matchless skill in the\r\norganization of material bodies, and such exquisite taste in the forms\r\nupon which they are modelled, has superadded that ethereal beauty which\r\nenhances their more permanent qualities, and presents them to us in\r\nthe ever-varying colours of the spectrum. Without this the foliage of\r\nvegetable life might have filled the eye and fostered the fruit which\r\nit veils,—but the youthful green of its spring would have been blended\r\nwith the dying yellow of its autumn. Without this the diamond might\r\nhave displayed to science the beauty of its forms, and yielded to the\r\narts its adamantine virtues;—but it would have ceased to shine in the\r\nchaplet of beauty, and to sparkle in the diadem of princes. Without\r\nthis the human countenance might have expressed all the sympathies of\r\nthe heart, but the “purple light of love” would not have risen on the\r\ncheek, nor the hectic flush been the herald of its decay.\r\n\r\nThe gay colouring with which the Almighty has decked the pale marble\r\nof nature is not the result of any quality inherent in the coloured\r\nbody, or in the particles by which it may be tinged, but is merely a\r\nproperty of the light in which they happen to be placed. Newton was the\r\nfirst person who placed this great truth in the clearest evidence. He\r\nfound that all bodies, whatever were their peculiar colours, exhibited\r\nthese colours only in white light. When they were illuminated by\r\nhomogeneous _red_ light they appeared _red_, by homogeneous _yellow_\r\nlight, _yellow_, and so on, “their colours being most brisk and vivid\r\nunder the influence of their own daylight colours.” The leaf of a\r\nplant, for example, appeared _green_ in the white light of day, because\r\nit had the property of reflecting that light in greater abundance than\r\nany other. When it was placed in homogeneous _red_ light, it could no\r\nlonger appear _green_, because there was no green light to reflect; but\r\nit reflected a portion of red light, because there was some red in the\r\ncompound green which it had the property of reflecting. Had the leaf\r\noriginally reflected a pure homogeneous green, unmixed with red, and\r\nreflected no white light from its outer surface, it would have appeared\r\nquite black in pure homogeneous red light, as this light does not\r\ncontain a single ray which the leaf was capable of reflecting. Hence\r\nthe colours of material bodies are owing to the property which they\r\npossess of stopping certain rays of white light, while they reflect\r\nor transmit to the eye the rest of the rays of which white light is\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nSo far the Newtonian doctrine of colours is capable of rigid\r\ndemonstration; but its author was not content with carrying it thus\r\nfar: he sought to determine the manner in which particular rays are\r\nstopped, while others are reflected or transmitted; and the result of\r\nthis profound inquiry was his theory of the colours of natural bodies,\r\nwhich was communicated to the Royal Society on the 10th February,\r\n1675. This theory is perhaps the loftiest of all his speculations; and\r\nthough, as a physical generalization, it stands on a perishable basis,\r\nand must soon be swept away in the progress of science, it yet bears\r\nthe deepest impress of the grasp of his powerful intellect.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which this theory is founded are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. Bodies that have the greatest refractive powers reflect the greatest\r\nquantity of light; and at the confines of equally refracting media\r\nthere is no reflection.\r\n\r\n2. The least particles of almost all natural bodies are in some measure\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\n3. Between the particles of bodies are many pores or spaces, either\r\nempty or filled with media of less density than the particles.\r\n\r\n4. The particles of bodies and their pores, or the spaces between the\r\nparticles, have some definite size.\r\n\r\nUpon these principles Newton explains the origin of _transparency_,\r\n_opacity_, and _colour_.\r\n\r\n_Transparency_ he considers as arising from the particles and their\r\nintervals or pores being too small to cause reflection at their common\r\nsurfaces,[19] so that all the light which enters transparent bodies\r\npasses through them without any portion of it being turned from its\r\npath by reflection. If we could obtain, for example, a film of mica\r\nwhose thickness does not exceed two-thirds of the millionth part of an\r\ninch, all the light which fell upon it would pass through it, and none\r\nwould be reflected. If this film was then cut into fragments, a number\r\nof such fragments would constitute a bundle, which would also transmit\r\nall the light which fell upon it, and be perfectly transparent.\r\n\r\n_Opacity_ in bodies arises, he thinks, from an opposite cause, viz.\r\nwhen the parts of bodies are of such a size as to be capable of\r\nreflecting the light which falls upon them, in which case the light is\r\n“stopped or stifled” by the multitude of reflections.\r\n\r\nThe _colours_ of natural bodies have, in the Newtonian hypothesis, the\r\nsame origin as the colours of thin plates, their transparent particles,\r\naccording to their several sizes, reflecting rays of one colour,\r\nand transmitting those of another. “For if a thinned or plated body\r\nwhich, being of an uneven thickness, appears all over of one uniform\r\ncolour, should be slit into threads, or broken into fragments of the\r\nsame thickness with the plate or film, every thread or fragment should\r\nkeep its colour, and consequently, a heap of such threads or fragments\r\nshould constitute a mass or powder of the same colour which the plate\r\nexhibited before it was broken: and the parts of all natural bodies\r\nbeing like so many fragments of a plate, must, on the same grounds,\r\nexhibit the same colour.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the theory of the colours of natural bodies, stated as\r\nclearly and briefly as we can. It has been very generally admitted\r\nby philosophers, both of our own and of other countries, and has\r\nbeen recently illustrated and defended by a French philosopher of\r\ndistinguished eminence. That this theory affords the true explanation\r\nof certain colours, or, to speak more correctly, that certain colours\r\nin natural bodies are the colours of thin plates, cannot be doubted;\r\nbut it will not be difficult to show that it is quite inapplicable to\r\nthat great class of phenomena which may be considered as representing\r\nthe colours of natural bodies.\r\n\r\nThe first objection to the Newtonian theory is the total absence of\r\nall reflected light from the particles of transparent coloured media,\r\nsuch as coloured gems, coloured glasses, and coloured fluids. This\r\nobjection was urged long ago by Mr. Delaval, who placed coloured fluids\r\non black grounds, and never could perceive the least trace of the\r\nreflected tints. I have repeated the experiment with every precaution,\r\nand with every variation that I could think of, and I consider it as\r\nan established fact, that in such coloured bodies the complementary\r\nreflected colour cannot be rendered visible. If the fluid, for example,\r\nbe _red_, the _green_ light from which the red has been separated\r\nought to appear either directly by looking into the coloured mass, or\r\nought to be recognised by its influence in modifying the light really\r\nreflected; but as it cannot be seen, we must conclude that it has not\r\nbeen reflected, but has been destroyed by some other property of the\r\ncoloured body.\r\n\r\nA similar objection may be drawn from the disappearance of the\r\ntransmitted complementary colour in the leaves of plants and petals\r\nof flowers. I have ascertained from numerous experiments, that the\r\ntransmitted colour is almost invariably the same with the reflected\r\ncolour, and that the same holds true with the coloured juices expressed\r\nfrom them. The complementary tints are never seen, and wherever\r\nthere has been any thing like an approximation to two tints, I have\r\ninvariably found that it arose from there being two different coloured\r\njuices existing in different sides of the leaf.\r\n\r\nIn the phenomena of the light transmitted by coloured glasses, there\r\nare some peculiarities which, we think, demonstrate that their colours\r\nare not those of thin plates. The light, for example, transmitted\r\nthrough a particular kind of blue glass, has a blue colour of such a\r\npeculiar composition that there is no blue in any of the orders of\r\ncolours in thin plates which has any resemblance to it. It is entirely\r\ndestitute of the red rays which form the middle of the red space in\r\nthe spectrum; so that the particles on which the colour depends must\r\nreflect the middle red rays, and transmit those on each side of it,—a\r\nproperty which cannot be deduced from the Newtonian doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of _opacity_, as arising from a multitude of\r\nreflections, is liable to the same objection which we have urged\r\nagainst the explanation of colour. In order to appreciate its weight,\r\nwe must distinguish opacity into two kinds, namely, the _opacity of\r\nwhiteness_ and the _opacity of blackness_. Those bodies which possess\r\nthe power of reflection in the highest degree, such as white metals,\r\nchalk, and plaster of Paris, never reflect more than one-half of the\r\nlight which falls upon them. The other half of the incident light is,\r\naccording to Newton, lost by a multitude of reflections. But how is\r\nit lost? Reflection merely changes the direction of the particles of\r\nlight, so that they must again emerge from the body, unless they are\r\nreflected into fixed returning orbits, which detain them for ever in a\r\nstate of motion within the body. In the case of black opacity, such as\r\nthat of coal, which reflects from its first surface only 1/25th of the\r\nwhite light, the difficulty is still greater, and we cannot conceive\r\nhow any system of interior reflections could so completely stifle\r\n24/25ths of the whole incident light, without some of it returning to\r\nthe eye in a visible form.\r\n\r\nIn determining the constitution of bodies that produce _transparency_\r\nand _blackness_, the Newtonian theory encounters a difficulty which\r\nits author has by no means surmounted. Transparency, as we have\r\nalready seen, arises from the “particles and their interstices being\r\ntoo small to cause reflections in their common surfaces,” that is,\r\nthey must be “less than any of those which exhibit colours,” or\r\n“less than is requisite to reflect the _white_ and very faint blue\r\nof the first order. But _this is the very same constitution which\r\nproduces blackness_ by reflection, and in order to explain the cause\r\nof blackness by transmission, or black opacity, Newton is obliged to\r\nintroduce a new principle.\r\n\r\n“For the production of _black_,” says he, “the corpuscles must be less\r\nthan any of those which exhibit colours. For at all greater sizes there\r\nis too much light reflected to constitute this colour. But if they\r\nbe supposed a little less than is requisite to reflect the white and\r\nvery faint blue of the first order, they will reflect so very little\r\nlight as to appear intensely black, _and yet may perhaps variously\r\nrefract[20] it_ to and fro within themselves so long, until it happens\r\nto be stifled and lost, by which means they will appear black in all\r\npositions of the eye, without any transparency.”\r\n\r\nThis very remarkable passage exhibits, in a striking manner, the\r\nperplexity in which our author was involved by the difficulties of his\r\nsubject. As the particles which produce blackness by reflection are\r\nnecessarily so small as to exclude the existence of any reflective\r\nforces, he cannot ascribe the loss of the intromitted light, as he does\r\nin the case of white opacity, to “a multitude of reflections;” and\r\ntherefore he is compelled to have recourse to _refracting forces_ to\r\nperform the same office. The reluctance with which he avails himself\r\nof this expedient is well marked in the mode of expression which he\r\nadopts; and I am persuaded that when he wrote the above passage, he\r\nfelt the full force of the objections to this hypothesis, which cannot\r\nfail to present themselves. As the size of the particles which produce\r\nblackness are intermediate between those which produce transparency\r\nand those which produce colour, approaching closely to the latter, it\r\nis difficult to conceive why _they_ should refract the intromitted\r\nlight, while the greater and smaller particles, and even those almost\r\nof the same size, should be destitute of that property. It is, besides,\r\nnot easy to understand how a refraction can take place within bodies\r\nwhich shall stifle all the light, and prevent it from emerging. Nay, we\r\nmay admit the existence of such refractions, and yet understand how, by\r\na compensation in their direction, the refracted rays may all emerge\r\nfrom the opaque body.\r\n\r\nThe force of these objections is tacitly recognised in Pemberton’s View\r\nof Sir Isaac Newton’s Philosophy;[21] and as Newton not only read and\r\napproved of that work, but even perused a great part of it along with\r\nits author, we may fairly consider the opinion there stated to be his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n“For producing _black_, the particles ought to be smaller than for\r\nexhibiting any of the colours, viz. of a size answering to the\r\nthickness of the bubble, whereby reflecting little or no light, it\r\nappears colourless; _but yet they must not be too small_, for that will\r\nmake them transparent _through deficiency of reflections_ in the inward\r\nparts of the body, sufficient to stop the light from going through it;\r\nbut they must be of a size _bordering upon that_ disposed to reflect\r\nthe faint blue of the first order, which affords an evident reason why\r\nblacks usually partake a little of that colour.” In this passage all\r\nidea of refraction is abandoned, and that precise degree of size is\r\nassumed for the particles which leaves a small power of reflection,\r\nwhich is deemed sufficient to prevent the body from becoming\r\ntransparent; that is, sufficient to render it opaque or black.\r\n\r\nThe last objection which we shall state to this theory is one to which\r\nwe attach great weight, and, as it is founded on discoveries and views\r\nwhich have been published since the time of Newton, we venture to\r\nbelieve, that, had he been aware of them, he would never have proposed\r\nthe theory which we are considering.\r\n\r\nWhen light falls upon a thin film such as AEC, _fig. 9_, p. 80, so\r\nas to produce the colours of thin plates, it follows, from Sir Isaac\r\nNewton’s theory of fits, that a portion of the light is, as usual,\r\nreflected at the first surface AE,[22] while the light which forms the\r\ncoloured image is that which is reflected from the second surface EC,\r\nso that all the colours of thin plates are diluted with the white light\r\nreflected from the first surface. Now, in the modern theory, which\r\nascribes the colours of thin plates to the interference of the light\r\nreflected from the second surface EC, with the light reflected from the\r\nfirst surface AE, the resulting tint arises from the combination of\r\nthese two pencils, and consequently there is no white light reflected\r\nfrom the surface AE. In like manner, when the thickness of the film is\r\nsuch that the two interfering pencils completely destroy one another,\r\nand produce black, there is not a ray of light reflected from the first\r\nsurface. Here, then, we have a criterion for deciding between the\r\ntheory of fits and the theory of interference; for if there is no white\r\nlight reflected from the first surface AE, the theory of fits must be\r\nrejected. In a remarkable phenomenon of blackness arising from minute\r\nfibres, which I have had occasion to describe, there was no perceptible\r\nreflection from the surface of the fibres;[23] and M. Fresnel describes\r\nan experiment made to determine the same point, and states the result\r\nof it to have been unequivocally in favour of the doctrine of\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nIn order to apply this important fact, let us take a piece of coal, one\r\nof the blackest and most opaque of all substances, and which does not\r\nreflect to the eye a single ray out of those which enter its substance.\r\nThe size of its particles is so small, that they are incapable of\r\nreflecting light. When a number of these particles are placed together,\r\nso as to form a surface, and other particles behind them, so as to form\r\na solid, they will not acquire by this process the power of reflection;\r\nand consequently, a piece of coal so composed should be destitute of\r\nthe property of reflecting light from its first surface. But this is\r\nnot the case,—light is abundantly reflected from the first surface of\r\nthe coal, and consequently, its elementary particles must possess the\r\nsame power. Hence the blackness of coal must be ascribed to some other\r\ncause than to the minuteness of its transparent atoms.\r\n\r\nTo transparent bodies this argument has a similar application. As their\r\natoms are still less than those of black bodies, their inability to\r\nreflect light is still greater, and hence arises their transparency.\r\nBut the particles forming the surface of such bodies do reflect light,\r\nand, therefore, their transparency must have another origin.\r\n\r\nIn the case of coloured bodies, too, the particles forming their\r\nsurfaces reflect white light like those of all other bodies, so that\r\nthese particles cannot produce colour on the same principles as those\r\nof thin plates. In many of those cases of colour which seem to depend\r\nupon the minuteness of the particles of the body, the reflection of\r\nwhite light may nevertheless be observed, but this will be found\r\nto arise from a thin transparent film, behind which the colorific\r\nparticles are placed.\r\n\r\nWhatever answer may be given to these objections, we think it will\r\nbe admitted by those who have studied the subject most profoundly,\r\nthat a satisfactory theory of the colours of natural bodies is still a\r\n_desideratum_ in science. How far we may be able to approach to it in\r\nthe present state of optics the reader will judge from the following\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nColours may be arranged into seven classes, each of which depends upon\r\ndifferent principles.\r\n\r\n1. Transparent coloured fluids—transparent coloured gems—transparent\r\ncoloured glasses—coloured powders—and the colours of the leaves and\r\nflowers of plants.\r\n\r\n2. Oxidations on metals—colours of Labrador feldspar—colours of\r\nprecious and hydrophanous opal, and other opalescences—the colours of\r\nthe feathers of birds, of the wings of insects, and of the scales of\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\n3. Superficial colours, as those of mother-of-pearl and striated\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\n4. Opalescences and colours in composite crystals having double\r\nrefraction.\r\n\r\n5. Colours from the absorption of common and polarized light by doubly\r\nrefracting crystals.\r\n\r\n6. Colours at the surfaces of media of different dispersive powers.\r\n\r\n7. Colours at the surface of media in which the reflecting forces\r\nextend to different distances, or follow different laws.\r\n\r\nThe first two of these classes are the most important. The Newtonian\r\ntheory appears to be strictly applicable to the phenomena of the\r\n_second_ class; but those of the first class cannot, we conceive, be\r\nreferred to the same cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rays of solar light possess several remarkable physical properties:\r\nThey heat—they illuminate—they promote chymical combination—they effect\r\nchymical decompositions—they impart magnetism to steel—they alter\r\nthe colours of bodies—they communicate to plants and flowers their\r\npeculiar colours, and are in many cases necessary to the development of\r\ntheir characteristic qualities. It is impossible to admit for a moment\r\nthat these varied effects are produced by a mere mechanical action,\r\nor that they arise from the agitation of the particles of bodies by\r\nthe vibration of the ether which is considered to be the cause of\r\nlight. Whatever be the difficulties which attach to the theory which\r\nsupposes light to consist of material particles, we are compelled, by\r\nits properties, to admit that light acts as if it were material, and\r\nthat it enters into combinations with bodies, in order to produce the\r\neffects which we have enumerated.\r\n\r\nWhen a beam of light falls upon a body, and the whole or a part of that\r\nwhich enters its substance totally disappears, we are entitled to say,\r\nthat it is detained by some power exercised by the particles of the\r\nbody over the particles of light. When this light is said to be lost\r\nby a multitude of reflections or refractions, the statement is not\r\nonly hypothetical, but it is an hypothesis incompatible with optical\r\nprinciples. That the light detained within bodies has been stopped by\r\nthe attractive force of the particles seems to be highly probable,\r\nand the mind will not feel any repugnance to admit that the particles\r\nof all bodies, whether solid, fluid, or aëriform, have a specific\r\naffinity for the particles of light. Considering light, therefore, as\r\nmaterial, it is not difficult to comprehend how it should, like other\r\nelementary substances, enter into combination with bodies, and produce\r\nmany chymical and physical effects, but particularly the phenomena of\r\ntransparency, opacity, and colour.\r\n\r\nIn _transparent_ colourless bodies, such as water and glass, the\r\nintromitted light experiences a considerable loss, because a certain\r\nnumber of its particles are attracted and detained by the atoms of the\r\nwater or glass, and the light which emerges is colourless, because the\r\nparticles exercise a proportional action over all the simple colours\r\nwhich compose white light.\r\n\r\nWhen the transparent body has any decided _colour_, such as those\r\nenumerated in Class I., then the particles of the body have exercised\r\na specific attraction over those rays of white light which are\r\ncomplementary to those which compose the colour of the transmitted\r\nlight. If the transparent body, for example, is _red_, then its\r\nparticles have detained the green rays which entered into the incident\r\nlight, or certain other rays, which with the red are necessary to\r\ncompose white light. In compound bodies, like some of the artificial\r\nglasses, the particles will attract and detain rays of light of\r\ndifferent colours, as may be seen by analyzing the transmitted light\r\nwith a prism, which will exhibit a spectrum deprived of all the rays\r\nwhich have been detained. In black bodies the particles exercise a\r\npowerful attraction over light, and detain all the intromitted rays.\r\n\r\nWhen coloured bodies are opaque, so as to exhibit their colours\r\nprincipally by reflection, the light which is reflected back to the\r\nobserver has received its colour from transmission through part of the\r\nthickness of the body, or, what is the same thing, the colour reflected\r\nto the eye is complementary to that which has been detained by the\r\nparticles of the body while the light is passing and repassing through\r\na thickness terminated by the reflecting surfaces; and as only a part\r\nof this light is reflected, as in the case of leaves and flowers, the\r\ntransmitted light must have the same colour as the reflected light.\r\n\r\nWhen coloured bodies exhibit two different colours complementary to\r\neach other, the one seen by reflection and the other by transmission,\r\nit is then highly probable that the colours are those of thin plates,\r\nthough there are still other optical principles to which they may be\r\nreferred. As the particles of bodies, and the medium which unites\r\nthem, or, as the different atoms of a compound body may have different\r\ndispersive powers, while they exercise the same refractive force over a\r\nparticular part of the spectrum, the rays for which this compensation\r\ntakes place will be transmitted, while part of the complementary light\r\nis reflected.[24] Or in cases where the refractive and dispersive\r\npowers are the same, the reflective forces of the particles may vary\r\naccording to a different law, so that at the separating surfaces either\r\nwhite or coloured light may be reflected.[25]\r\n\r\nIn those cases of colour where the reflected and the transmitted tints\r\nare not complementary, as in _leaf-gold_, where the former is _yellow_\r\nand the latter _green_;—in _leaf-silver_, where they are _white_\r\nand _blue_, and in certain pieces of fir-wood, where the reflected\r\nlight is _whitish yellow_, and the transmitted light a _brilliant\r\nhomogeneous red_, we may explain the separation of the colours either\r\nby the principles we have already laid down or by the doctrine of thin\r\nplates. On the first principle, the colour of the reflected light,\r\nwhich is supposed to be the same as that of the transmitted light, will\r\nbe modified by the law according to which the particles of the body\r\nattract different rays out of the beam of white light. In pitch, for\r\nexample, the blue rays are first absorbed, so that at small thicknesses\r\nthe transmitted light is a fine yellow, while, by the action of a\r\ngreater thickness, the yellow itself is absorbed, and the transmitted\r\nlight is a bright homogeneous red. Now in leaf-gold the transmitted\r\ncolour of thinner films than we can obtain may be yellow, and,\r\nconsequently, the light reflected from the first strata of interrupting\r\nfaces will be yellow, and will determine the predominant tint of the\r\nreflected light. On the Newtonian doctrine, Mr. Herschel has explained\r\nit by saying, “that the transmitted rays have traversed the whole\r\nthickness of the medium, and therefore undergo many more times the\r\naction of its atoms than those reflected, especially those near the\r\nfirst surface to which the brighter part of the reflected colour is\r\ndue.”\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of the absorption of common and polarized light, which I\r\nhave described in another place,[26] throw much light on the subject\r\nof coloured bodies. The relation of the absorbent action to the axes\r\nof double refraction, and, consequently, to the poles of the molecules\r\nof the crystal, shows how the particles of light attracted by the\r\nmolecules of the body will vary, both in their nature and number,\r\naccording to the direction in which they approach the molecules; and\r\nexplains how the colour of a body may be changed, either temporarily\r\nor permanently, by heat, according as it produces a temporary or a\r\npermanent change in the relative position of the molecules. This is not\r\nthe place to enlarge on this subject; but we may be permitted to apply\r\nthe idea to the curious experiment of Thenard on phosphorus. When this\r\nsubstance is rendered pure by repeated distillation, it is transparent,\r\nand transmits yellow light; but when it is thrown in a melted state\r\ninto cold water, it becomes jet black. When again melted, it resumes\r\nits original colour and transparency. According to the Newtonian\r\ntheory, we must suppose that the atoms of the phosphorus have been\r\ndiminished in size by sudden cooling,—an effect which it is not easy\r\nto comprehend; but, according to the preceding views, we may suppose\r\nthat the atoms of the phosphorus have been forced by sudden cooling\r\ninto relative positions quite different from those which they take\r\nwhen they slowly assume the solid state, and their poles of maximum\r\nattraction, in place of being turned to one another, are turned in\r\ndifferent directions, and then allowed to exercise their full action in\r\nattracting the intromitted light, and detaining it wholly within the\r\nbody.[27]\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, there is one topic peculiarly\r\ndeserving our notice, namely, the change of colour produced in bodies\r\nby continued exposure to light. The general effect of light is to\r\ndiminish or dilute the colours of bodies, and in many cases to deprive\r\nthem entirely of their colour. Now, it is not easy to understand how\r\nrepeated undulations propagated through a body could diminish the\r\nsize of its particles, or how the same effect could be produced by a\r\nmultitude of reflections from particle to particle. But if light is\r\nattracted by the particles of bodies, and combines with them, it is\r\neasy to conceive that, when the molecules of a body have combined with\r\na great number of particles of a green colour, for example, their power\r\nof combination with others will be diminished, and, consequently, the\r\nnumber of particles of any colour absorbed or detained must diminish\r\nwith the time that the body has been exposed to light; that is, these\r\nparticles must enter into the transmitted and reflected pencils, and\r\ndiminish the intensity of their colour. If the body, for example,\r\nabsorbs red light, and transmits and reflects green, then if the\r\nquantity of absorbed red light is diminished, it will enter into the\r\nreflected and transmitted pencils, and, forming white light by its\r\nmixture with a portion of the green rays, will actually dilute them in\r\nthe same manner as if a portion of white light had been added.[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  _Newton’s Discoveries respecting the Inflection or Diffraction of\r\n    Light—Previous Discoveries of Grimaldi and Dr. Hooke—Labours of\r\n    succeeding Philosophers—Law of Interference of Dr. Young—Fresnel’s\r\n    Discoveries—New Theory of Inflection on the Hypothesis of the\r\n    Materiality of Light._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the discoveries of Newton respecting the _Inflection of Light_\r\nwere first published in his _Optics_ in 1704, yet there is reason to\r\nthink that they were made at a much earlier period. Sir Isaac, indeed,\r\ninforms us, in his preface to that great work, that the third book,\r\nwhich contains these discoveries, “was put together out of scattered\r\npapers;” and he adds at the end of his observations, that “he designed\r\nto repeat most of them with more care and exactness, and to make some\r\nnew ones for determining the manner how the rays of light are bent\r\nin their passage by bodies, for making the fringes of colours with\r\nthe dark lines between them. But I was then interrupted, and cannot\r\nnow think of taking these things into consideration.” On the 18th\r\nMarch, 1674, Dr. Hooke had read a valuable memoir on the phenomena of\r\ndiffraction; and, as Sir Isaac makes no allusion whatever to this work,\r\nit is the more probable that his “scattered papers” had been written\r\nprevious to the communication of Dr. Hooke’s experiments.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of the inflection of light were first discovered by\r\nFrancis Maria Grimaldi, a learned Jesuit, who has described them in a\r\nposthumous work published in 1665, two years after his death.[29]\r\n\r\nHaving admitted a beam of the sun’s light through a small pin-hole in\r\na piece of lead or card into a dark chamber, he found that the light\r\ndiverged from this aperture in the form of a cone, and that the shadows\r\nof all bodies placed in this light were not only larger than might have\r\nbeen expected, but were surrounded with three coloured fringes, the\r\nnearest being the widest, and the most remote the narrowest. In strong\r\nlight he discovered analogous fringes within the shadows of bodies,\r\nwhich increased in number with the breadth of the body, and became\r\nmore distinct when the shadow was received obliquely and at a greater\r\ndistance. When two small apertures or pin-holes were placed so near\r\neach other that the cones of light formed by each of them intersected\r\none another, Grimaldi observed, that a spot common to the circumference\r\nof each, or, which is the same thing, illuminated by rays from each\r\ncone, was darker than the same spot when illuminated by either of\r\nthe cones separately; and he announces this remarkable fact in the\r\nfollowing paradoxical proposition, “_that a body actually illuminated\r\nmay become more dark_ by adding a _light to that which it already\r\nreceives_.”\r\n\r\nWithout knowing what had been done by the Italian philosopher, our\r\ncountryman, Dr. Robert Hooke, had been diligently occupied with the\r\nsame subject. In 1672, he communicated his first observations to the\r\nRoyal Society, and he then spoke of his paper as “containing the\r\ndiscovery of a new property of light not mentioned by any optical\r\nwriters before him.” In his paper of 1674, already mentioned, and which\r\nis no doubt the one to which he alludes, he has not only described\r\nthe leading phenomena of the inflection, or the deflection of light,\r\nas he calls it, but he has distinctly announced the _doctrine of\r\ninterference_, which has performed so great a part in the subsequent\r\nhistory of optics.[30]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the subject when Newton directed to it his powers\r\nof acute and accurate observation. His attention was turned only to the\r\nenlargement of the shadow, and to the three fringes which surrounded\r\nit; and he begins his observations by ascribing the discovery of these\r\nfacts to Grimaldi. After taking exact measures of the diameter of the\r\nshadow of a human hair, and of the breadth of the fringes at different\r\ndistances behind it, he discovered the remarkable fact that these\r\ndiameters and breadths were not proportional to the distances from the\r\nhair at which they were measured. In order to explain these phenomena,\r\nNewton supposed that the rays which passed by the edge of the hair\r\nare deflected or turned aside from it, as if by a repulsive force,\r\nthe nearest rays suffering the greatest, and those more remote a less\r\ndegree of deflection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 10._]\r\n\r\nThus, if X, fig. 10, represents a section of the hair, and AB, CD, EF,\r\nGH, &c. rays passing at different distances from X, the ray AB will be\r\nmore deflected than CD, and will cross it at _m_, the ray CD will for\r\nthe same reason cross EF at _n_, and EF will cross GH at _o_. Hence the\r\ncurve or caustic formed by the intersections _m_, _n_, _o_, &c. will\r\nbe convex outward, its curvature diminishing as it recedes from the\r\nvertex. As none of the passing light can possibly enter within this\r\ncurve, it will form the boundary of the shadow of X.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given by Sir Isaac of the coloured fringes is less\r\nprecise, and can be inferred only from the two following queries.\r\n\r\n1. “Do not the rays which differ in refrangibility differ also in\r\nflexibility, and are they not, by these different inflections separated\r\nfrom one another, so as after separation to make the colours in the\r\nthree fringes above described? And after what manner are they inflected\r\nto make those fringes?\r\n\r\n2. “Are not the rays of light in passing by the edges and sides of\r\nbodies _bent several times backwards and forwards_ with a motion like\r\nthat of an eel? And do not the three fringes of light above mentioned\r\narise from three such bendings?”\r\n\r\nThe idea thus indistinctly thrown out in the preceding queries has\r\nbeen ingeniously interpreted by Mr. Herschel in the manner represented\r\nin fig. 11, where SS are two rays passing by the edge of the body\r\nMN. These rays are supposed to undergo several bendings, as at _a_,\r\n_b_, _c_, and the particles of light are thrown off at one or other\r\nof the points of contrary flexure, according to the state of their\r\nfits or other circumstances. Those that are thrown outwards in the\r\ndirection _a_A, _b_B, _c_C, _d_D, will produce as many caustics by\r\ntheir intersections as there are deflected rays; and each caustic, when\r\nreceived on a screen at a distance, will depict on it the brightest\r\npart or maximum of a fringe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 11._]\r\n\r\nIn this unsatisfactory state was the subject of the inflection of light\r\nleft by Sir Isaac. His inquiries were interrupted, and never again\r\nrenewed; and though he himself found that the phenomena were the same,\r\n“whether the hair was encompassed with air or with any other pellucid\r\nsubstance,” yet this important result does not seem to have shaken his\r\nconviction, that the phenomena had their origin in the action of bodies\r\nupon light.\r\n\r\nDuring two sets of experiments which I made on the inflection of light,\r\nthe first in 1798, and the second in 1812 and 1813, I was desirous\r\nof examining the influence of density and refractive power over the\r\nfringes produced by inflection. I compared the fringes formed by\r\ngold-leaf with those formed by masses of gold,—and those produced by\r\nfilms which gave the colours of thin plates with those formed by masses\r\nof the same substance. I examined the influence of platinum, diamond,\r\nand cork in inflecting light, the effect of non-reflecting grooves\r\nand spaces in polished metals, and of cylinders of glass immersed in\r\na mixture of oil of cassia and oil of olives of the same refractive\r\npower; and, as the fringes had the same magnitude and character under\r\nall these circumstances, I concluded that they were not produced by any\r\nforce inherent in the bodies themselves, but arose from a property of\r\nthe light itself, which always showed itself when light was stopped in\r\nits progress.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Young, who had supported with great ingenuity and force\r\nof argument the undulatory theory of light, as maintained by Hooke\r\nand Huygens, was the first who gave a plausible explanation of the\r\ninflection of light. By interposing a small screen at B, _fig. 10_, and\r\nintercepting the rays that passed near the hair X, he was surprised to\r\nfind that all the _fringes within the shadow disappeared_. The same\r\neffect took place when the screen intercepted the rays on the other\r\nside; and hence he concluded, that the rays on each side of the hair\r\nwere necessary to the production of the inner fringes, and that the\r\nfringes were produced by the _interference_ of the rays that passed\r\non one side of the hair with those that passed on the other side. In\r\norder to account for the coloured fringes without the shadow, Dr.\r\nYoung conceived that the rays which pass near the edge of the hair\r\ninterfere with others, which he supposes may be reflected after falling\r\nvery obliquely upon its edge,—a supposition which, if correct, would\r\ncertainly produce fringes very similar to those actually observed.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing these researches so successfully begun by Dr. Young,\r\nM. Fresnel had the good fortune to explain all the phenomena of\r\ninflection by means of the undulatory doctrine combined with the\r\nprinciple of interference. In place of transmitting the light through\r\na small aperture, he caused it to diverge from the focus of a deep\r\nconvex lens, and instead of receiving the shadow and its fringes upon\r\na smooth white surface, as was done by Newton, he viewed them directly\r\nwith his eye through a lens placed behind the shadow; and by means\r\nof a microscope he was able to measure the dimensions of the fringes\r\nwith the greatest exactness. By this mode of observation he made the\r\nremarkable discovery, that the inflection of the light _depended on\r\nthe distance of the inflecting body from the aperture or from the\r\nfocus of divergence_;[31] the fringes being observed to dilate as\r\nthe body approached that focus, and to contract as it receded from\r\nit, their relative distances from each other, and from the margin of\r\nthe shadow continuing invariable. In attempting to account for the\r\nformation of the exterior fringes, M. Fresnel found it necessary to\r\nreject the supposition of Dr. Young, that they were owing to light\r\nreflected from the edge of the body. He not only ascertained that the\r\nreal place of the fringe was the 17/100th of a millimetre different\r\nfrom what it should be on that supposition, but he found that the\r\nfringes preserved the same intensity of light, whether the inflecting\r\nbody had a round or a sharp edge, and even when the edge was such\r\nas not to afford sufficient light for their production. From this\r\ndifficulty the undulatory theory speedily released him, and he was led\r\nby its indications to consider the exterior fringes, as produced by an\r\ninfinite number of elementary waves of light emanating from a primitive\r\nwave when partly interrupted by an opaque body.\r\n\r\nThe various phenomena of inflection, which had so long resisted every\r\neffort to generalize them, having thus received so beautiful and\r\nsatisfactory an explanation from the undulatory doctrine, they must\r\nof course be regarded as affording to that doctrine the most powerful\r\nsupport, while the Newtonian hypothesis of the materiality of light is\r\nproportionally thrown into the shade. It is impossible, indeed, even\r\nfor national partiality to consider the views of Newton as furnishing\r\nany explanation of the facts discovered by Fresnel; and, as no attempt\r\nhas been made by the small though able phalanx of his disciples to\r\nstay the decision with which, on this count at least, the doctrine\r\nof emission has been threatened, we shall venture to suggest some\r\nprinciples by which the refractory phenomena may perhaps be yet brought\r\nwithin the pale of the Newtonian theory.\r\n\r\nThat the particles of light, like those of heat, are endowed with a\r\nrepulsive force which prevents them from accumulating when in a state\r\nof condensation, or when they are detained by the absorptive action\r\nof opaque bodies, will be readily admitted. By this power a beam of\r\nlight radiating from a luminous point has, in every azimuth, the same\r\ndegree of intensity at the same distance from its centre of divergence;\r\nbut if we intercept a portion of such a beam by an opaque body, the\r\nrepulsive force of the light which formerly occupied its shadow is\r\nwithdrawn, and consequently the rays which pass near the body will be\r\nrepelled into the shadow, and will form, by their interference with\r\nthose similarly repelled on the other side, the interior fringes, which\r\nare parallel to the edges of the body. The rays which pass at a greater\r\ndistance will in like manner be bent towards the body, but with less\r\nforce, and, interfering with those rays which retain their primitive\r\ndirection, from the state of their fits or the position of their\r\npoles, they will form the exterior fringes. When the inflecting body\r\nis placed near the point of divergence, the greater proximity of the\r\nrays will produce a greater repulsive force, and consequently a greater\r\ninflection of the passing light; while the removal of the body from the\r\npoint of divergence will be accompanied with an increased distance of\r\nthe particles, an inferior repulsive force, and a feebler inflection.\r\nAs the phenomena of inflection, considered under this aspect, arise\r\nfrom a property of the light itself, it follows that they will remain\r\ninvariable, whatever be the nature or density of the body, or the form\r\nof the edge which acts upon the passing rays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  _Miscellaneous Optical Researches of Newton—His Experiments on\r\n    Refraction—His Conjecture respecting the Inflammability of the\r\n    Diamond—His Law of Double Refraction—His Observations on the\r\n    Polarization of Light—Newton’s Theory of Light—His “Optics.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore concluding our account of Newton’s optical discoveries, it is\r\nnecessary to notice some of his minor researches, which, though of\r\ninferior importance in the science of light, have either exercised an\r\ninfluence over the progress of discovery, or been associated with the\r\nhistory of other branches of knowledge.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious of these inquiries related to the connexion\r\nbetween the refractive powers and the chymical composition of bodies.\r\nHaving measured the refractive powers and the densities of twenty-two\r\nsubstances, he found that the forces which reflect and refract light\r\nare very nearly proportional to the densities of the same bodies. In\r\nthis law, however, he noticed a remarkable exception in the case of\r\nunctuous and sulphureous bodies, such as camphire, olive oil, linseed\r\noil, spirit of turpentine, and _diamond_, which have their refractive\r\npowers two or three times greater in respect of their densities than\r\nthe other substances in the table, while among themselves their\r\nrefractive powers are proportional to their densities, without any\r\nconsiderable variation. Hence he concluded that diamond “is an unctuous\r\nsubstance coagulated,”—a sagacious prediction, which has been verified\r\nin the discoveries of modern chymistry. The connexion between a high\r\ndegree of inflammability and a great refracting force has been still\r\nmore strongly established by the high refractive power which I detected\r\nin phosphorus, and which was discovered in hydrogen by MM. Biot and\r\nArago.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the optical labours of Newton which is less\r\nsatisfactory than that which relates to the double refraction of\r\nlight. In 1690, Huygens, published his admirable treatise on light,\r\nin which he has given the law of double refraction in calcareous\r\nspar, as deduced from his theory of light, and as confirmed by direct\r\nexperiment. Viewing it probably as a theoretical deduction, Newton\r\nseems to have regarded it as incorrect, and though he has given Huygens\r\nthe credit of describing the phenomena more exactly than Bartholinus,\r\nyet, without assigning any reason, he rejected the law of the Dutch\r\nphilosopher, and substituted another in its place. These observations\r\nof our author form the subject of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth\r\nqueries at the end of his Optics, which was published fourteen years\r\nafter the appearance of Huygens’s work. The law adopted by Newton\r\nis not accompanied with any of the experiments from which it was\r\ndeduced; and though he has given it without expressing any doubt of its\r\naccuracy, it is, nevertheless, entirely incompatible with observation,\r\nand has been rejected by all succeeding philosophers.\r\n\r\nIn his speculations respecting the successive disappearance and\r\nreappearance of two of the four images which are formed when a\r\nluminous object is viewed through two rhombs of calcareous spar, one\r\nof which is made to revolve upon the other, Newton has been more\r\nsuccessful. He concluded from these phenomena that every ray of light\r\nhas two opposite sides originally endued with the property on which\r\nthe unusual refraction depends, and other two opposite sides not\r\nendued with that property; and he suggested it as a subject for future\r\ninquiry, whether there are not more properties of light by which the\r\nsides of the rays differ, and are distinguished from one another. This\r\nis the first occasion on which the idea of a _polarity_ in the rays of\r\nlight has been suggested.[32]\r\n\r\nFrom the various optical inquiries in which Newton was engaged, he\r\nwas strongly impressed with the belief that light consists of small\r\nmaterial particles emitted from shining substances, and that these\r\nparticles could be again recombined into solid matter, so that “gross\r\nbodies and light were convertible into one another.” He conceived also\r\nthat the particles of solid bodies and of light exerted a mutual action\r\nupon each other, the former being agitated and heated by the latter,\r\nand the latter being attracted and repelled by the former, with forces\r\ndepending on the inertia of the luminous particles. These forces he\r\nregarded as insensible at all measurable distances, and he conceived\r\nthat the distances between the particles of bodies were very small when\r\ncompared with the extent of their sphere of attraction and repulsion.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Hooke, Huygens, and Euler, almost all the\r\ncontemporaries and successors of Newton maintained the doctrine of the\r\nmateriality of light. It was first successfully assailed by Dr. Thomas\r\nYoung, and since that time it has been shaken to its foundation by\r\nthose great discoveries which have illustrated the commencement of the\r\npresent century. The undulatory theory, which has thus triumphed in\r\nits turn, is still subject to grave difficulties, and we fear another\r\ncentury must elapse before a final decision can be pronounced on this\r\nlong-agitated question.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the optical discoveries of Newton, of which\r\nwe have given a general history, were communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety in detached papers; but the disputes in which they had\r\ninvolved their author made him hesitate about the publication of his\r\nother discoveries. Although he had drawn up a connected view of his\r\nlabours under the title of “Opticks, or a Treatise on the Reflexions,\r\nRefractions, Inflexions, and Colours of Light,” yet he resolved not to\r\npublish this work during the life of Hooke, by whose rival jealousy\r\nhis tranquillity had been so frequently interrupted. Hooke, however,\r\ndied in 1702, and the Optics of Newton appeared in English in 1704. Dr.\r\nSamuel Clark proposed a Latin edition of it, which appeared in 1706,\r\nand he was generously presented by Sir Isaac with 500_l._ (or 100_l._\r\nfor each of his five children), as a token of the approbation and\r\ngratitude of the author. Both the English and the Latin editions have\r\nbeen frequently reprinted both in England and on the Continent,[33]\r\nand there perhaps never was a work of profound science so widely\r\ncirculated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  _Astronomical Discoveries of Newton—Necessity of combined Exertion\r\n    to the Completion of great Discoveries—Sketch of the History of\r\n    Astronomy previous to the Time of Newton—Copernicus, 1473–1543—\r\n    Tycho Brahe, 1546–1601—Kepler, 1571–1631—Galileo, 1564–1642._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the optical labours of Newton we now proceed to the history of his\r\nastronomical discoveries—those transcendent deductions of human reason\r\nby which he has secured to himself an immortal name, and vindicated\r\nthe intellectual dignity of his species. Pre-eminent as his triumphs\r\nhave been, it would be unjust to affirm that they were achieved by his\r\nsingle arm. The torch of many a preceding age had thrown its light\r\ninto the strongholds of the material universe, and the grasp of many\r\na powerful hand had pulled down the most impregnable of its defences.\r\nAn alliance, indeed, of many kindred spirits had been long struggling\r\nin this great cause, and Newton was but the leader of their mighty\r\nphalanx,—the director of their combined genius,—the general who won the\r\nvictory, and therefore wears its laurels.\r\n\r\nThe history of science presents us with no example of an individual\r\nmind throwing itself far in advance of its contemporaries. It is only\r\nin the career of crime and ambition that reckless man takes the start\r\nof his species, and, uncurbed by moral and religious restraint, erects\r\nan unholy dynasty upon the ruins of ancient and venerable institutions.\r\nThe achievements of intellectual power, though often begun by one\r\nmind and completed by another, have ever been the results of combined\r\nexertions. Slow in their growth, they gradually approximate to a more\r\nperfect condition:—the variety in the phenomena of nature call forth a\r\nvariety of intellectual gifts;—the powers of analysis and combination\r\nare applied to the humbler labours of observation and experiment,\r\nand in the ordeal of rival inquiry truth is finally purified from\r\nerror. How different is it with those systems which the imagination\r\nrears,—those theories of wild import which are directed against the\r\nconsciences and hopes of man. The fatal upas-tree distils its poison\r\nin the spring as well as the autumn of its growth, but the fruit which\r\nsustains life must have its bud prepared before the approach of winter,\r\nits blossom expanded in the spring, and its juices elaborated by the\r\nlight and heat of the summer and the autumnal sun.\r\n\r\nIn the century which preceded the birth of Newton the science of\r\nastronomy advanced with the most rapid steps. Emerging from the\r\ndarkness of the middle ages, the human mind seemed to rejoice in its\r\nnew-born strength, and to apply itself with elastic vigour to unfold\r\nthe mechanism of the heavens. The labours of Hipparchus and Ptolemy\r\nhad indeed furnished many important epochs and supplied many valuable\r\ndata; but the cumbrous appendages of cycles and epicycles with which\r\nthey explained the stations and retrogradations of the planets, and the\r\nvulgar prejudices which a false interpretation of Scripture had excited\r\nagainst a belief in the motion of the earth, rendered it difficult even\r\nfor great minds to escape from the trammels of authority, and appeal to\r\nthe simplicity of nature.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign of Castile, the generous and noble-minded Alphonso,\r\nhad long before proscribed the rude expedients of his predecessors;\r\nand when he declared that if the heavens were thus constituted,\r\nhe could have given the Deity good advice, he must not only have\r\nfelt the absurdity of the prevailing system, but must have obtained\r\nsome foresight of a more simple arrangement. But neither he nor the\r\nastronomers whom he so liberally protected seem to have established a\r\nbetter system, and it was left to Copernicus to enjoy the dignity of\r\nbeing the restorer of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis great man, a native of Thorn in Prussia, following his father’s\r\nprofession, began his career as a doctor of medicine, but an accidental\r\nattendance on the mathematical lectures of Brudzevius excited a love\r\nfor astronomy, which became the leading passion of his life. Quitting\r\na profession uncongenial to such pursuits, he went to Bologna to\r\nstudy astronomy under Dominic Maria; and after having enjoyed the\r\nfriendship and instruction of that able philosopher, he established\r\nhimself at Rome in the humble situation of a teacher of mathematics.\r\nHere he made numerous astronomical observations which served him as\r\nthe basis of future researches; but an event soon occurred which,\r\nthough it interrupted for a while his important studies, placed him in\r\na situation for pursuing them with new zeal. The death of one of the\r\ncanons enabled his uncle, who was Bishop of Ermeland, to appoint him to\r\na canonry in the chapter of Frauenburg, where, in a house situated on\r\nthe brow of a mountain, he continued, in peaceful seclusion, to carry\r\non his astronomical observations. During his residence at Rome his\r\ntalents had been so well appreciated, that the Bishop of Fossombrona,\r\nwho presided over the council for reforming the calendar, solicited the\r\naid of Copernicus in this desirable undertaking. At first he entered\r\nwarmly into the views of the council, and charged himself with the\r\ndetermination of the length of the year and of the month, and of the\r\nother motions of the sun and moon that seemed to be required; but he\r\nfound the task too irksome, and probably felt that it would interfere\r\nwith those interesting discoveries which had already begun to dawn upon\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nCopernicus is said to have commenced his inquiries by an historical\r\nexamination of the opinions of ancient authors on the system of the\r\nuniverse; but it is more likely that he sought for the authority of\r\ntheir great names to countenance his peculiar views, and that he was\r\nmore desirous to present his own theory as one that he had received,\r\nrather than as one which he had invented. His mind had been long\r\nimbued with the idea that simplicity and harmony should characterize\r\nthe arrangements of the planetary system, and, in the complication and\r\ndisorder which reigned in the hypothesis of Ptolemy, he saw insuperable\r\nobjections to its being regarded as a representation of nature. In the\r\nopinions of the Egyptian sages, in those of Pythagoras, Philolaus,\r\nAristarchus, and Nicetas, he recognised his own earliest conviction\r\nthat the earth was not the centre of the universe; but he appears to\r\nhave considered it as still possible that our globe might perform some\r\nfunction in the system more important than that of the other planets;\r\nand his attention was much occupied with the speculation of Martianus\r\nCapella, who placed the sun between Mars and the moon, and made\r\nMercury and Venus revolve round him as a centre; and with the system\r\nof Apollonius Pergæus, who made all the planets revolve round the sun,\r\nwhile the sun and moon were carried round the earth in the centre of\r\nthe universe. The examination, however, of these hypotheses gradually\r\ndispelled the difficulties with which the subject was beset; and after\r\nthe labours of more than thirty years, he was permitted to see the\r\ntrue system of the heavens. The sun he considered as immoveable in\r\nthe centre of the system, while the earth revolved between the orbits\r\nof Venus and Mars, and produced by its rotation about its axis all\r\nthe diurnal phenomena of the celestial sphere. The precession of the\r\nequinoxes was thus referred to a slight motion of the earth’s axis,\r\nand the stations and retrogradations of the planets were the necessary\r\nconsequence of their own motions combined with that of the earth about\r\nthe sun. These remarkable views were supported by numerous astronomical\r\nobservations; and in 1530 Copernicus brought to a close his immortal\r\nwork on the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies.\r\n\r\nBut while we admire the genius which triumphed over so many\r\ndifficulties, we cannot fail to commend the extraordinary prudence\r\nwith which he ushered his new system into the world. Aware of the\r\nprejudices, and even of the hostility with which such a system would\r\nbe received, he resolved neither to startle the one nor provoke the\r\nother. He allowed his opinions to circulate in the slow current of\r\npersonal communication. The points of opposition which they presented\r\nto established doctrines were gradually worn down, and they insinuated\r\nthemselves into reception among the ecclesiastical circles by the very\r\nreluctance of their author to bring them into notice. In the year\r\n1534, Cardinal Schonberg, Bishop of Capua, and Gyse, Bishop of Culm,\r\nexerted all their influence to induce Copernicus to lay his system\r\nbefore the world; but he resisted their solicitations; and it was not\r\ntill 1539 that an accidental circumstance contributed to alter his\r\nresolution. George Rheticus, professor of mathematics at Wirtemberg,\r\nhaving heard of the labours of Copernicus, resigned his chair, and\r\nrepaired to Frauenberg to make himself master of his discoveries.\r\nThis zealous disciple prevailed upon his master to permit the\r\npublication of his system; and they seem to have arranged a plan for\r\ngiving it to the world without alarming the vigilance of the church,\r\nor startling the prejudices of individuals. Under the disguise of a\r\nstudent of mathematics, Rheticus published in 1540 an account of the\r\nmanuscript volume of Copernicus. This pamphlet was received without\r\nany disapprobation, and its author was encouraged to reprint it at\r\nBasle, in 1541, with his own name. The success of these publications,\r\nand the flattering manner in which the new astronomy was received by\r\nseveral able writers, induced Copernicus to place his MSS. in the hands\r\nof Rheticus. It was accordingly printed at the expense of Cardinal\r\nSchonberg, and appeared at Nuremberg in 1543. Its illustrious author,\r\nhowever, did not live to peruse it. A complete copy was handed to him\r\nin his last moments, and he saw and touched it a few hours before his\r\ndeath. This great work was dedicated to the Holy Pontiff, in order, as\r\nCopernicus himself says, that the authority of the head of the church\r\nmight silence the calumnies of individuals who had attacked his views\r\nby arguments drawn from religion. Thus introduced, the Copernican\r\nsystem met with no ecclesiastical opposition, and gradually made its\r\nway in spite of the ignorance and prejudices of the age.\r\n\r\nAmong the astronomers who provided the materials of the Newtonian\r\nphilosophy the name of Tycho Brahe merits a conspicuous place.\r\nDescended from an ancient Swedish family, he was born at Knudstorp, in\r\nNorway, in 1546, three years after the death of Copernicus. The great\r\neclipse of the sun which happened on the 26th August, 1560, while he\r\nwas at the University of Copenhagen, attracted his notice: and when\r\nhe found that all its phenomena had been accurately predicted, he was\r\nseized with the most irresistible passion to acquire the knowledge of\r\na science so infallible in its results. Destined for the profession\r\nof the law, his friends discouraged the pursuit which now engrossed\r\nhis thoughts; and such were the reproaches and even persecutions to\r\nwhich he was exposed, that he quitted his country with the design of\r\ntravelling through Germany. At the very commencement of his journey,\r\nhowever, an event occurred in which the impetuosity of his temper had\r\nnearly cost him his life. At a wedding-feast in Rostock, a questionable\r\npoint in geometry involved him in a dispute with a Danish nobleman of\r\nthe same temperament with himself; and the two mathematicians resolved\r\nto settle the difference by the sword. Tycho, however, seems to have\r\nbeen second in the conflict, for he lost the greater part of his\r\nnose, and was obliged to supply its place by a substitute of gold and\r\nsilver, which a cement of glue attached to his face. During his stay at\r\nAugsburg he inspired the burgomaster of the city, Peter Hainzell, with\r\na love of astronomy. This public-spirited citizen erected an excellent\r\nobservatory at his own expense, and here Tycho began that distinguished\r\ncareer which has placed him in the first rank of practical astronomers.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Copenhagen in 1570, he was received with every mark\r\nof respect. The king invited him to court, and persons of all ranks\r\nharassed him with their attentions. At Herritzvold, near his native\r\nplace, the house of his maternal uncle afforded him a retreat from the\r\ngayeties of the capital, and he was there offered every accommodation\r\nfor the prosecution of his astronomical studies. Here, however, the\r\npassion of love and the pursuits of alchymy distracted his thoughts;\r\nbut though the peasant girl of whom he was enamoured was of easier\r\nattainment than the philosopher’s stone, the marriage produced an open\r\nquarrel with his relations, which it required the interference of\r\nthe king to allay. In the tranquillity of domestic happiness, Tycho\r\nresumed his study of the heavens, and in 1572 he enjoyed the singular\r\ngood fortune of observing, through all its variations, the new star\r\nin Cassiopeia, which appeared with such extraordinary splendour as\r\nto be visible in the daytime, and which gradually disappeared in the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nDissatisfied with his residence in Denmark, Tycho resolved to settle in\r\nsome distant country; and having gone as far as Venice in search of a\r\nsuitable residence, he at last fixed upon Basle, in Switzerland. The\r\nKing of Denmark, however, had learned his intention from the Prince\r\nof Hesse; and when Tycho returned to Copenhagen to remove his family\r\nand his instruments, his sovereign announced to him his resolution\r\nto detain him in his kingdom. He presented him with the canonry of\r\nRoschild, with an income of 2000 crowns per annum. To this he added\r\na pension of 1000 crowns; and he promised to give him the island of\r\nHuen, with a complete observatory erected under his own eye. This\r\ngenerous offer was instantly accepted. The celebrated observatory of\r\nUraniburg was established at the expense of about 20,000_l._; and in\r\nthis magnificent retreat Tycho continued for twenty-one years to enrich\r\nastronomy with the most valuable observations. Admiring disciples\r\ncrowded to this sanctuary of the sciences to acquire the knowledge of\r\nthe heavens; and kings[34] and princes felt themselves honoured by\r\nbecoming the guests of the great astronomer of the age.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal discoveries of Tycho was that of the inequality\r\nof the moon’s motion, called the variation. He detected, also, the\r\nannual equation which affects the place of her apogee and nodes, and he\r\ndetermined the greatest and the least inclination of the lunar orbit.\r\nHis observations on the planets were numerous and precise, and have\r\nformed the data of the present generalizations in astronomy. Though\r\nthus skilful in the observation of phenomena, his mind was but little\r\nsuited to investigate their cause, and it was probably owing to this\r\ndefect that he rejected the system of Copernicus. The vanity of giving\r\nhis own name to another system was not likely to actuate a mind such as\r\nhis, and it was more probable that he was led to adopt the immobility\r\nof the earth, and to make the sun, with all his attendant planets,\r\ncirculate round it, from the great difficulty which still presented\r\nitself by comparing the apparent diameter of the stars with the annual\r\nparallax of the earth’s orbit.\r\n\r\nThe death of Frederick in 1588 proved a severe calamity to Tycho, and\r\nto the science which he cultivated. During the first years of the\r\nminority of Christian IV. the regency continued the royal patronage\r\nto the observatory of Uraniburg; and in 1592 the young king paid a\r\nvisit of some days to Tycho, and left him a gold chain in token of his\r\nfavour. The astronomer, however, had made himself enemies at court, and\r\nthe envy of his high reputation had probably added fresh malignity to\r\nthe irritation of personal feelings. Under the ministry of Wolchendorf,\r\na name for ever odious to science, Tycho’s pension was stopped;—he was\r\nin 1597 deprived of the canonry of Roschild, and was thus forced, with\r\nhis wife and children, to seek an asylum in a foreign land. His friend,\r\nHenry Rantzau, of Wansbeck, under whose roof he found a hospitable\r\nshelter, was fortunately acquainted with the emperor Rodolph II., who,\r\nto his love of science, added a passion for alchymy and astrology.\r\nThe reputation of Tycho having already reached the imperial ear, the\r\nrecommendation of Rantzau was scarcely necessary to ensure him his\r\nwarmest friendship. Invited by the emperor, he repaired in 1599 to\r\nPrague, where he met with the kindest reception. A pension of three\r\nthousand crowns was immediately settled upon him, and a commodious\r\nobservatory erected for his use in the vicinity of that city. Here\r\nthe exiled astronomer renewed with delight his interrupted labours,\r\nand the gratitude which he cherished for the royal favour increased\r\nthe satisfaction which he felt in having so unexpectedly found a\r\nresting-place for approaching age. These prospects of better days were\r\nenhanced by the good fortune of receiving two such men as Kepler and\r\nLongomontanus for his pupils; but the fallacy of human anticipation was\r\nhere, as in so many other cases, strikingly displayed. Tycho was not\r\naware of the inroads which both his labours and his disappointments\r\nhad made upon his constitution. Though surrounded with affectionate\r\nfriends and admiring disciples, he was still an exile in a foreign\r\nland. Though his country had been base in its ingratitude, it was yet\r\nthe land which he loved,—the scene of his earliest affection,—the\r\ntheatre of his scientific glory. These feelings continually preyed upon\r\nhis mind, and his unsettled spirit was ever hovering among his native\r\nmountains. In this condition he was attacked with a disease of the most\r\npainful kind, and though the paroxysms of its agonies had lengthened\r\nintermissions, yet he saw that death was approaching. He implored his\r\npupils to persevere in their scientific labours. He conversed with\r\nKepler on some of the profoundest points of astronomy, and with these\r\nsecular occupations he mingled frequent acts of piety and devotion. In\r\nthis happy condition he expired without pain at the age of fifty-five,\r\nthe unquestionable victim of the councils of Christian IV.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the accessions which astronomy had received from the\r\nlabours of Copernicus and Tycho, no progress was yet made in developing\r\nthe general laws of the system, and scarcely an idea had been formed\r\nof the power by which the planets were retained in their orbits. The\r\nlabours of assiduous observers had supplied the materials for this\r\npurpose, and Kepler arose to lay the foundations of physical astronomy.\r\n\r\nJohn Kepler was born at Wiel, in Wirtemberg, in 1571. He was educated\r\nfor the church, and discharged even some of the clerical functions;\r\nbut his devotion to science withdrew him from the study of theology.\r\nHaving received mathematical instruction from the celebrated Mæstlinus,\r\nhe had made such progress in the science, that he was invited in 1594\r\nto fill the mathematical chair of Gratz in Styria. Endowed with a\r\nfertile imagination, his mind was ever intent upon subtle and ingenious\r\nspeculations. In the year 1596 he published his peculiar views in\r\na work on the Harmonies and Analogies of Nature. In this singular\r\nproduction, he attempts to solve what he calls the great cosmographical\r\nmystery of the admirable proportion of the planetary orbits; and by\r\nmeans of the six regular geometrical solids,[35] he endeavours to\r\nassign a reason why there are six planets, and why the dimensions of\r\ntheir orbits and the time of their periodical revolutions were such as\r\nCopernicus had found them. If a cube, for example, were inserted in a\r\nsphere, of which Saturn’s orbit was one of the great circles, it would,\r\nhe supposed, touch by its six planes the lesser sphere of Jupiter;\r\nand, in like manner, he proposes to determine, by the aid of the other\r\ngeometrical solids, the magnitude of the spheres of the other planets.\r\nA copy of this work was presented by its author to Tycho Brahe, who had\r\nbeen too long versed in the severe realities of observation to attach\r\nany value to such wild theories. He advised his young friend “first to\r\nlay a solid foundation for his views by actual observation, and then,\r\nby ascending from these, to strive to reach the causes of things;”\r\nand there is reason to think that, by the aid of the whole Baconian\r\nphilosophy, thus compressed by anticipation into a single sentence, he\r\nabandoned for a while his visionary inquiries.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1598 Kepler suffered persecution for his religious\r\nprinciples, and was compelled to quit Gratz; but though he was recalled\r\nby the States of Styria, he felt his situation insecure, and accepted\r\nof a pressing invitation from Tycho to settle at Prague, and assist\r\nhim in his calculations. Having arrived in Bohemia in 1600, he was\r\nintroduced by his friends to the Emperor Rodolph, from whom he ever\r\nafterward received the kindest attention. On the death of Tycho in\r\n1601, he was appointed mathematician to the emperor,—a situation in\r\nwhich he was continued during the successive reigns of Matthias and\r\nFerdinand; but what was of more importance to science, he was put in\r\npossession of the valuable collection of Tycho’s observations. These\r\nobservations were remarkably numerous; and as the orbit of Mars was\r\nmore oval than that of any of the other planets, they were peculiarly\r\nsuitable for determining its real form. The notions of harmony and\r\nsymmetry in the construction of the solar system, which had filled\r\nthe mind of Kepler, necessarily led him to believe that the planets\r\nrevolved with a uniform motion in circular orbits. So firm, indeed,\r\nwas this conviction, that he made numerous attempts to represent the\r\nobservations of Tycho by this hypothesis. The deviations were too\r\ngreat to be ascribed to errors of observation; and in trying various\r\nother curves, he was led to the discovery that Mars revolved round\r\nthe sun in an elliptical orbit, in one of the foci of which the sun\r\nitself was placed. The same observations enabled him to determine the\r\ndimensions of the planet’s orbit, and by comparing together the times\r\nin which Mars passed over different portions of its orbit, he found\r\nthat they were to one another as the areas described by the lines\r\ndrawn from the centre of the planet to the centre of the sun, or, in\r\nmore technical terms, that the radius vector describes equal areas\r\nin equal times. These two remarkable discoveries, the first that were\r\never made in physical astronomy, were extended to all the other planets\r\nof the system, and were communicated to the world in 1609, in his\r\n“Commentaries on the Motions of the Planet Mars, as deduced from the\r\nobservations of Tycho Brahe.”\r\n\r\nAlthough our author was conducted to these great laws by the patient\r\nexamination of well-established facts, his imagination was ever\r\nhurrying him among the wilds of conjecture. Convinced that the mean\r\ndistances of the planets from the sun bore to one another some\r\nmysterious relation, he not only compared them with the regular\r\ngeometrical solids, but also with the intervals of musical tones; an\r\nidea which the ancient Pythagoreans had suggested, and which had been\r\nadopted by Archimedes himself. All these comparisons were fruitless;\r\nand Kepler was about to abandon an inquiry of about seventeen years’\r\nduration, when, on the 8th March, 1618, he conceived the idea of\r\ncomparing the powers of the different members which express the\r\nplanetary distances, in place of the numbers themselves. He compared\r\nthe squares and the cubes of the distances with the same powers of the\r\nperiodic times; nay, he tried even the squares of the times with the\r\ncubes of the distances; but his hurry and impatience led him into an\r\nerror of calculation, and he rejected this law as having no existence\r\nin nature! On the 15th May, his mind again reverted to the same\r\nnotion, and upon making the calculations anew, and free from error, he\r\ndiscovered the great law, that the squares of the periodic times of any\r\ntwo planets are to one another as the cubes of their distances from the\r\nsun. Enchanted with this unexpected result, he could scarcely trust his\r\ncalculations; and, to use his own language, he at first believed that\r\nhe was dreaming, and had taken for granted the very truth of which he\r\nwas in search. This brilliant discovery was published in 1619, in his\r\n“Harmony of the World;” a work dedicated to James VI. of Scotland. Thus\r\nwere established what have been called the three laws of Kepler,—the\r\nmotion of the planets in elliptical orbits,—the proportionality between\r\nthe areas described and their times of description,—and the relations\r\nbetween the squares of the periodic times and the cubes of the\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the movements of the planets to the sun, as the general\r\ncentre of all their orbits, could not fail to suggest to Kepler that\r\nsome power resided in that luminary by which these various motions\r\nwere produced; and he went so far as to conjecture that this power\r\ndiminishes as the square of the distance of the body on which it was\r\nexerted; but he immediately rejects this law, and prefers that of\r\nthe simple distances. In his work on Mars, he speaks of gravity as a\r\nmutual and corporeal affection between similar bodies. He maintained\r\nthat the tides were occasioned by the moon’s attraction, and that the\r\nirregularities of the lunar motions, as detected by Tycho, were owing\r\nto the joint actions of the sun and the earth; but the relation between\r\ngravity, as exhibited on the earth’s surface, and as conducting the\r\nplanets in their orbits, required more patience of thought than he\r\ncould command, and was accordingly left for the exercise of higher\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThe misery in which Kepler lived forms a painful contrast with the\r\nservices which he performed to science. The pension on which he\r\nsubsisted was always in arrears, and though the three emperors whose\r\nreigns he adorned directed their ministers to be more punctual in its\r\npayment, the disobedience of their commands was a source of continued\r\nvexation to Kepler. When he retired to Sagan, in Silesia, to spend\r\nin retirement the remainder of his days, his pecuniary difficulties\r\nbecame still more harassing. Necessity at last compelled him to apply\r\npersonally for the arrears which were due; and he accordingly set out\r\nin 1630 for Ratisbon; but in consequence of the great fatigue which so\r\nlong a journey on horseback produced, he was seized with a fever, which\r\ncarried him off on the 30th November, 1630, in the 59th year of his age.\r\n\r\nWhile Kepler was thus laying the foundation of physical astronomy,\r\nGalileo was busily employed in extending the boundaries of the solar\r\nsystem. This distinguished philosopher was born at Pisa in 1564.\r\nHe was the son of a Florentine nobleman, and was educated for the\r\nmedical profession; but a passion for geometry took possession of his\r\nmind, and called forth all his powers. Without the aid of a master,\r\nhe studied the writings of Euclid and of Archimedes; and such were\r\nhis acquirements, that he was appointed by the Grand-duke of Tuscany\r\nto the mathematical chair of Pisa in the twenty-fifth year of his\r\nage. His opposition to the Aristotelian philosophy gained him many\r\nenemies, and at the end of three years he quitted Pisa, and accepted\r\nof an invitation to the professorship of mathematics at Padua. Here\r\nhe continued for eighteen years adorning the university by his name,\r\nand diffusing around him a taste for the physical sciences. With\r\nthe exception of some contrivances of inferior importance, Galileo\r\nhad distinguished himself by no discovery till he had reached the\r\nforty-fifth year of his age. In the year 1609, the same year in which\r\nKepler published his celebrated commentary on Mars, Galileo paid a\r\nvisit to Venice, where he heard, in the course of conversation, that a\r\nDutchman of the name of Jansens had constructed and presented to Prince\r\nMaurice an instrument through which he saw distant objects magnified\r\nand rendered more distinct, as if they had been brought nearer to the\r\nobserver. This report was credited by some and disbelieved by others;\r\nbut, in the course of a few days, Galileo received a letter from James\r\nBadovere at Paris, which placed beyond a doubt the existence of such\r\nan instrument. The idea instantly filled his mind as one of the utmost\r\nimportance to science; and so thoroughly was he acquainted with the\r\nproperties of lenses, that he not only discovered the principle of its\r\nconstruction, but was able to complete a telescope for his own use.\r\nInto one end of a leaden tube he fitted a spectacle-glass plane on one\r\nside and convex on the other, and in the other end he placed another\r\nspectacle-glass concave on one side and plane on the other. He then\r\napplied his eye to the concave glass, and saw objects “pretty large\r\nand pretty near him.” They appeared three times nearer, and nine times\r\nlarger in surface, than to the naked eye. He soon after made another,\r\nwhich represented objects above sixty times larger; and, sparing\r\nneither labour nor expense, he finally constructed an instrument so\r\nexcellent, as “to show things almost a thousand times larger, and above\r\nthirty times nearer to the naked eye.”\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no invention that science has presented to man so\r\nextraordinary in its nature, and so boundless in its influence, as\r\nthat of the telescope. To the uninstructed mind, the power of seeing\r\nan object a thousand miles distant, as large and nearly as distinct\r\nas if it were brought within a mile of the observer, must seem almost\r\nmiraculous; and to the philosopher, even, who thoroughly comprehends\r\nthe principles upon which it acts, it must ever appear one of the most\r\nelegant applications of science. To have been the first astronomer in\r\nwhose hands such a gift was placed was a preference to which Galileo\r\nowed much of his future reputation.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he completed his telescope than he applied it to the\r\nheavens, and on the 7th January, 1618, the first day of its use, he\r\nsaw round Jupiter three bright little stars lying in a line parallel\r\nto the ecliptic, two to the east, and one to the west of the planet.\r\nRegarding them as ordinary stars, he never thought of estimating their\r\ndistances. On the following day, when he accidentally directed his\r\ntelescope to Jupiter, he was surprised to see the three stars to the\r\nwest of the planet. To produce this effect it was requisite that the\r\nmotion of Jupiter should be direct, though, according to calculation,\r\nit was actually retrograde. In this dilemma he waited with impatience\r\nfor the evening of the 9th, but unfortunately the sky was covered with\r\nclouds. On the 10th he saw only two stars to the east—a circumstance\r\nwhich he was no longer able to explain by the motion of Jupiter. He was\r\ntherefore compelled to ascribe the change to the stars themselves; and\r\nupon repeating his observations on the 11th, he no longer doubted that\r\nhe had discovered three planets revolving round Jupiter. On the 13th\r\nJanuary he for the first time saw the fourth satellite.[36]\r\n\r\nThis discovery, though of the utmost importance in itself, derived an\r\nadditional value from the light which it threw on the true system of\r\nthe universe. While the earth was the only planet enlightened by a\r\nmoon, it might naturally be supposed that it alone was habitable, and\r\nwas therefore entitled to the pre-eminence of occupying the centre of\r\nthe system; but the discovery of four moons round a much larger planet\r\ndeprived this argument of its force, and created a new analogy between\r\nthe earth and the other planets. When Kepler received the “Sidereal\r\nMessenger,” the work in which Galileo announced his discovery in 1610,\r\nhe perused it with the deepest interest; and while it confirmed and\r\nextended his substantial discoveries, it dispelled at the same time\r\nsome of those harmonic dreams which still hovered among his thoughts.\r\nIn the “Dissertation” which he published on the discovery of Galileo,\r\nhe expresses his hope that satellites will be discovered round Saturn\r\nand Mars,—he conjectures that Jupiter has a motion of rotation about\r\nhis axis,—and states his surprise, that, after what had been written on\r\nthe subject of telescopes by Baptista Porta, they had not been earlier\r\nintroduced into observatories.\r\n\r\nIn continuing his observations, Galileo applied his telescope to\r\nVenus, and in 1610 he discovered the phases of that planet, which\r\nexhibited to him the various forms of the waxing and the waning moon.\r\nThis fact established beyond a doubt that the planet revolved round\r\nthe sun, and thus gave an additional blow to the Ptolemaic system. In\r\nhis observations on the sun, Galileo discovered his spots, and deduced\r\nfrom them the rotation of the central luminary. He observed that\r\nthe body of Saturn had handles attached to it; but he was unable to\r\ndetect the form of its ring, or render visible its minute satellites.\r\nOn the surface of the moon he discovered her mountains and valleys,\r\nand determined the curious fact of her libration, in virtue of which\r\nparts of the margin of her disk occasionally appear and disappear. In\r\nthe Milky Way he descried numerous minute stars which the unassisted\r\neye was unable to perceive; and as the largest fixed stars, in place\r\nof being magnified by the telescope, became actually minute brilliant\r\npoints, he inferred their immense distance as rendered necessary by the\r\nCopernican hypothesis. All his discoveries, indeed, furnished fresh\r\narguments in favour of the new system; and the order of the planets and\r\ntheir relation to a central sun may now be considered as established by\r\nincontrovertible evidence.\r\n\r\nWhile Galileo was occupied with these noble pursuits at Pisa, to which\r\nhe had been recalled in 1611, his generous patron, Cosmo II. Grand-duke\r\nof Tuscany, invited him to Florence, that he might pursue with\r\nuninterrupted leisure his astronomical observations, and carry on his\r\ncorrespondence with the German astronomers. His fame had now resounded\r\nthrough all Europe;—the strongholds of prejudice and ignorance\r\nwere unbarred;—and the most obstinate adherents of ancient systems\r\nacknowledged the meridian power of the day-star of science. Galileo\r\nwas ambitious of propagating the great truths which he contributed so\r\npowerfully to establish. He never doubted that they would received\r\nwith gratitude by all,—by the philosopher as the consummation of\r\nthe greatest efforts of human genius,—and by the Christian as the\r\nmost transcendent displays of Almighty power. But he had mistaken\r\nthe disposition of his species, and the character of the age. That\r\nsame system of the heavens which had been discovered by the humble\r\necclesiastic of Frauenberg, which had been patronised by the kindness\r\nof a bishop, and published at the expense of a cardinal, and which\r\nthe pope himself had sanctioned by the warmest reception, was, after\r\nthe lapse of a hundred years, doomed to the most violent opposition,\r\nas subversive of the doctrines of the Christian faith. On no former\r\noccasion has the human mind exhibited such a fatal relapse into\r\nintolerance. The age itself had improved in liberality;—the persecuted\r\ndoctrines themselves had become more deserving of reception;—the light\r\nof the Reformed faith had driven the Catholics from some of their most\r\nobnoxious positions;—and yet, under all these circumstances, the church\r\nof Rome unfurled her banner of persecution against the pride of Italy,\r\nagainst the ornament of his species, and against truths immutable and\r\neternal.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of complaints laid before the Holy Inquisition, Galileo\r\nwas summoned to appear at Rome in 1615, to answer for the heretical\r\nopinions which he had promulgated. He was charged with “maintaining\r\nas true the false doctrine held by many, that the sun was immoveable\r\nin the centre of the world, and that the earth revolved with a\r\ndiurnal motion;—with having certain disciples to whom he taught the\r\nsame doctrine;—with keeping up a correspondence on the subject with\r\nseveral German mathematicians;—with having published letters on the\r\nsolar spots, in which he explained the same doctrine as true;—and\r\nwith having glossed over with a false interpretation the passages of\r\nScripture which were urged against it.” The consideration of these\r\ncharges came before a meeting of the Inquisition, which assembled on\r\nthe 25th February, 1616; and the court, declaring their disposition to\r\ndeal gently with the prisoner, pronounced the following decree:—“That\r\nCardinal Bellarmine should enjoin Galileo to renounce entirely the\r\nabove-recited false opinions; that, on his refusal to do so, he\r\nshould be commanded by the commissary of the Inquisition to abandon\r\nthe said doctrine, and to cease to teach and defend it; and that, if\r\nhe did not obey this command, he should be thrown into prison.” On\r\nthe 26th of February Galileo appeared before Cardinal Bellarmine,\r\nand, after receiving from him a gentle admonition, he was commanded\r\nby the commissary, in the presence of a notary and witnesses, to\r\ndesist altogether from his erroneous opinions; and it was declared\r\nto be unlawful for him in future to teach them in any way whatever,\r\neither orally or in his writings. To these commands Galileo promised\r\nobedience, and was dismissed from the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe mildness of this sentence was no doubt partly owing to the\r\ninfluence of the Grand-duke of Tuscany, and other persons of rank and\r\ninfluence at the papal court, who took a deep interest in the issue\r\nof the trial. Dreading, however, that so slight a punishment might\r\nnot have the effect of putting down the obnoxious doctrines, the\r\nInquisition issued a decree denouncing the new opinions as false and\r\ncontrary to the sacred writings, and prohibiting the sale of every book\r\nin which they should be maintained.\r\n\r\nThus liberated from his persecutors, Galileo returned to Florence,\r\nwhere he pursued his studies with his wonted diligence and ardour. The\r\nrecantation of his astronomical opinions was so formal and unreserved,\r\nthat ordinary prudence, if not a sense of personal honour, should\r\nhave restrained him from unnecessarily bringing them before the\r\nworld. No anathema was pronounced against his scientific discoveries;\r\nno interdict was laid upon the free exercise of his genius. He was\r\nprohibited merely from teaching a doctrine which the church of Rome\r\nconsidered to be injurious to its faith. We might have expected,\r\ntherefore, that a philosopher so conspicuous in the eyes of the world\r\nwould have respected the prejudices, however base, of an institution\r\nwhose decrees formed part of the law of the land, and which possessed\r\nthe power of life and death within the limits of its jurisdiction.\r\nGalileo, however, thought otherwise. A sense of degradation[37] seems\r\nto have urged him to retaliate, and before six years had elapsed, he\r\nbegan to compose his “Cosmical System, or Dialogues on the two greatest\r\nSystems of the World, the Ptolemean and the Copernican,” the concealed\r\nobject of which is to establish the opinions which he had promised\r\nto abandon. In this work the subject is discussed by three speakers,\r\nSagredo, Salviatus, and Simplicius, a peripatetic philosopher, who\r\ndefends the system of Ptolemy with much skill against the overwhelming\r\narguments of the rival disputants. Galileo hoped to escape notice by\r\nthis indirect mode of propagating the new system, and he obtained\r\npermission to publish his work, which appeared at Florence in 1632.\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition did not, as might have been expected, immediately\r\nsummon Galileo to their presence. Nearly a year elapsed before they\r\ngave any indication of their design; and, according to their own\r\nstatement, they did not even take the subject under consideration till\r\nthey saw that the obnoxious tenets were every day gaining ground, in\r\nconsequence of the publication of the Dialogues. They then submitted\r\nthe work to a careful examination, and having found it to be a direct\r\nviolation of the injunction which had been formerly intimated to\r\nits author, they again cited him before their tribunal in 1633. The\r\nvenerable sage, now in his seventieth year, was thus compelled to\r\nrepair to Rome, and when he arrived he was committed to the apartments\r\nof the Fiscal of the Inquisition. The unchangeable friendship, however,\r\nof the Grand-duke of Tuscany obtained a remission of this severity, and\r\nGalileo was allowed to reside at the house of the Tuscan ambassador\r\nduring the two months which the trial occupied. When brought before the\r\nInquisition, and examined upon oath, he acknowledged that the Dialogues\r\nwere written by himself, and that he obtained permission to publish\r\nthem without notifying to the person who gave it that he had been\r\nprohibited from holding, defending, or teaching the heretical opinions.\r\nHe confessed also that the Dialogues were composed in such a manner,\r\nthat the arguments in favour of the Copernican system, though given as\r\npartly false, were yet managed in such a manner that they were more\r\nlikely to confirm than overturn its doctrines; but that this error,\r\nwhich was not intentional, arose from the natural desire of making an\r\ningenious defence of false propositions, and of opinions that had the\r\nsemblance of probability.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving these confessions and excuses, the Inquisition allowed\r\nGalileo a proper time for giving in his defence; but this seems to\r\nhave consisted solely in bringing forward the certificate of Cardinal\r\nBellarmine already mentioned, which made no allusion to the promise\r\nunder which Galileo had come never to defend, nor teach in any way\r\nwhatever, the Copernican doctrines. The court held this defence to be\r\nan aggravation of the crime rather than an excuse for it, and proceeded\r\nto pronounce a sentence which will be ever memorable in the history of\r\nthe human mind.\r\n\r\nInvoking the name of our Saviour, they declare, that Galileo had made\r\nhimself liable to the suspicion of heresy, by believing the doctrine,\r\ncontrary to Scripture, that the sun was the centre of the earth’s\r\norbit, and did not move from east to west; and by defending as probable\r\nthe opinion that the earth moved, and was not the centre of the world;\r\nand that he had thus incurred all the censures and penalties which were\r\nenacted by the church against such offences;—but that he should be\r\nabsolved from these penalties, provided he sincerely abjured and cursed\r\nall the errors and heresies contained in the formula of the church,\r\nwhich should be submitted to him. That so grave and pernicious a crime\r\nshould not pass altogether unpunished, that he might become more\r\ncautious in future, and might be an example to others to abstain from\r\nsuch offences, they decreed that his Dialogues should be prohibited\r\nby a formal edict,—that he should be condemned to the prison of the\r\nInquisition during pleasure,—and that, during the three following\r\nyears, he should recite once a week the seven penitential psalms.\r\n\r\nThis sentence was subscribed by seven cardinals; and on the 22d\r\nJune, 1633, Galileo signed an abjuration humiliating to himself and\r\ndegrading to philosophy. At the age of seventy, on his bended knees,\r\nand with his right hand resting on the Holy Evangelists, did this\r\npatriarch of science avow his present and his past belief in all\r\nthe dogmas of the Romish Church, abandon as false and heretical the\r\ndoctrine of the earth’s motion and of the sun’s immobility, and pledge\r\nhimself to denounce to the Inquisition any other person who was even\r\nsuspected of heresy. He abjured, cursed, and detested those eternal\r\nand immutable truths which the Almighty had permitted him to be the\r\nfirst to establish. What a mortifying picture of moral depravity and\r\nintellectual weakness! If the unholy zeal of the assembly of cardinals\r\nhas been branded with infamy, what must we think of the venerable\r\nsage whose gray hairs were entwined with the chaplet of immortality,\r\nquailing under the fear of man, and sacrificing the convictions of his\r\nconscience and the deductions of his reason at the altar of a base\r\nsuperstition? Had Galileo but added the courage of the martyr to the\r\nwisdom of the sage,—had he carried the glance of his indignant eye\r\nround the circle of his judges,—had he lifted his hands to heaven, and\r\ncalled the living God to witness the truth and immutability of his\r\nopinions, the bigotry of his enemies would have been disarmed, and\r\nscience would have enjoyed a memorable triumph.\r\n\r\nThe great truths of the Copernican system, instead of being considered\r\nas heretical, had been actually adopted by many pious members of the\r\nCatholic church, and even some of its dignitaries did not scruple\r\nto defend it openly. Previous to the first persecution of Galileo\r\nin 1615, a Neapolitan nobleman, Vincenzio Caraffa, a person equally\r\ndistinguished by his piety and birth, had solicited Paul Anthony\r\nFoscarinus, a learned Carmelite monk, to illustrate and defend the\r\nnew system of the universe. With this request the ecclesiastic\r\nspeedily complied; and in the pamphlet which he completed on the 6th\r\nJanuary, 1615, he defends the Copernican system with much boldness and\r\ningenuity; he reconciles the various passages of Scripture with the new\r\ndoctrine, and he expresses the hope that such an attempt, now made for\r\nthe first time, will prove agreeable to philosophers, but particularly\r\nto those very learned men, Galileo Galilei, John Kepler, and all the\r\nmembers of the Lyncean Academy, who, he believes, entertain the same\r\nopinion. This remarkable production, written from the convent of the\r\nCarmelites at Naples, is dedicated to the very Reverend Sebastian\r\nFantoni, general of the order of Carmelites, and was published at\r\nFlorence, with the sanction of the ecclesiastical authorities, in 1630;\r\nthree years before the second persecution of Galileo.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know the state of public feeling in Italy\r\nwhen Galileo was doomed to the prisons of the Inquisition. No appeal\r\nseems to have been made against so cruel a sentence; and neither\r\nin remonstrance nor in derision does an individual voice seem to\r\nhave been raised. The master spirits of the age looked with sullen\r\nindifference on the persecution of exalted genius; and Galileo lay in\r\nchains, deserted and unpitied. This unrebuked triumph of his enemies\r\nwas perhaps favourable to the object of their vengeance. Resistance\r\nmight have heightened the rigour of a sentence, which submission seems\r\nto have alleviated. The interference of some eminent individuals of\r\nRome, among whom we have no doubt that the Grand-duke of Tuscany was\r\nthe most influential, induced Pope Urban VIII., not only to shorten\r\nthe period, but to soften the rigour of Galileo’s imprisonment. From\r\nthe dungeon of the Inquisition, where he had remained only four days,\r\nhe was transported to the ambassador’s palace in the Garden de Medici\r\nat Rome; and when his health had begun to suffer, he was permitted\r\nto leave the metropolis; and would have been allowed to return to\r\nFlorence, but as the plague raged in that city, he was sent, in July,\r\n1633, to the archiepiscopal palace of Sienna, the residence of the\r\nArchbishop Piccolimini, where he carried on and completed his valuable\r\ninvestigations respecting the resistance of solids. Here he continued\r\nfive months, when, in consequence of the disappearance of the plague at\r\nFlorence, he was allowed to retire to his villa at Bellosguardo, and\r\nafterward to that of Arcetri in the vicinity of Florence.\r\n\r\nThough Galileo was now, to a certain degree, liberated from the power\r\nof man, yet the afflicting dispensations of Providence began to fall\r\nthickly around him. No sooner had he returned to Arcetri, than his\r\nfavourite daughter, Maria, was seized with a dangerous illness, which\r\nsoon terminated in her death. He was himself attacked with hernia,\r\npalpitation of the heart, loss of appetite, and the most oppressive\r\nmelancholy; and though he solicited permission to repair to Florence\r\nfor medical assistance, yet this deed of mercy was denied him. In 1638,\r\nhowever, the pope permitted him to pay a visit to Florence, and his\r\nfriend, Father Castelli, was allowed to visit him in the company of an\r\nofficer of the Inquisition. But this indulgence was soon withdrawn, and\r\nat the end of a few months he was remanded to Arcetri. The sight of his\r\nright eye had begun to fail in 1636, from an opacity of the cornea. In\r\n1637 his left eye was attacked with the same complaint; so that in a\r\nfew months he was affected with total and incurable blindness. Before\r\nthis calamity had supervened, he had noticed the curious phenomenon of\r\nthe moon’s libration, in consequence of which, parts of her visible\r\ndisk that are exposed to view at one time are withdrawn at another. He\r\nsucceeded in explaining two of the causes of this curious phenomenon,\r\nviz. the different distances of the observer from the line joining the\r\ncentre of the earth and the moon, which produces the diurnal libration,\r\nand the unequal motion of the moon in her orbit, which produces the\r\nlibration in longitude. It was left, however, to Hevelius to discover\r\nthe libration in latitude, which arises from the inclination of her\r\naxis being a little less than a right angle to the ecliptic; and to\r\nLagrange to discover the spheroidal libration, or that which arises\r\nfrom the action of the earth upon the lunar spheroid.\r\n\r\nThe sorrows with which Galileo was now beset, seemed to have disarmed\r\nthe severity of the Inquisition. He was freely permitted to enjoy the\r\nsociety of his friends, who now thronged around him to express their\r\nrespect and their sympathy. The Grand-duke of Tuscany was his frequent\r\nvisiter, and Gassendi, Deodati, and our countryman Milton went to Italy\r\nfor the purpose of visiting him. He entertained his friends with the\r\nwarmest hospitality, and though simple and abstemious in his diet, yet\r\nhe was fond of good wine, and seems even in his last days to have paid\r\nparticular attention to the excellence of his cellar.\r\n\r\nAlthough Galileo had nearly lost his hearing as well as his sight, yet\r\nhis intellectual faculties were unimpaired; and while his mind was\r\noccupied in considering the force of percussion, he was seized with\r\nfever and palpitation of the heart, which, after two months’ illness,\r\nterminated his life on the 8th of January, 1642.\r\n\r\nAmong the predecessors of Newton in astronomical research we must not\r\nomit the names of Bouillaud (Bullialdus), Borelli, and Dr. Hooke.\r\nIsmael Bouillaud, a native of Laon in France, and the author of several\r\nvaluable astronomical works, has derived more reputation from a single\r\nsentence in his _Astronomica Philolaica_, published in 1645, than from\r\nall the rest of his labours. He was not a believer in the doctrine\r\nof attraction, which, as we have already seen, had been broached by\r\nCopernicus, and discovered by Kepler; but in speaking of that power as\r\nthe cause of the planetary motions, he remarks, “that if attraction\r\nexisted, it would decrease as the square of the distance.” The\r\ninfluence of gravity was still more distinctly developed by Borelli,\r\na Neapolitan philosopher, who published in 1666 a work on Jupiter’s\r\nsatellites.[38] In this work he maintains, that all the planets perform\r\ntheir motions round the sun according to a general law; that the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter and of Saturn move round their primary planets\r\nin the same manner as the moon does round the earth, and that they all\r\nrevolve round the sun, which is the only source of any virtue, and that\r\nthis virtue attaches them, and unites them so that they cannot recede\r\nfrom their centre of action.[39]\r\n\r\nOur countryman Dr. Robert Hooke seems to have devoted much of\r\nhis attention to the cause of the planetary motions. On the 21st\r\nMarch, 1666, he read to the Royal Society an account of a series of\r\nexperiments for determining if bodies experience any variation in\r\ntheir weight at different distances from the centre of the earth. His\r\nexperiments, as Hooke himself saw, were by no means satisfactory,\r\nand hence he was led to the ingenious idea of measuring the force of\r\ngravity by observing, at different altitudes, the rate of a pendulum\r\nclock. About two months afterward, he exhibited to the Society an\r\napproximate representation of the forces which retain the planets\r\nin their orbits, in the paths described by a circular pendulum\r\nimpelled with different degrees of force; but though this experiment\r\nillustrated the production of a curvilineal motion, by combining a\r\ntangential force with a central power of attraction, yet it was only\r\nan illustration, and could not lead to the true cause of the planetary\r\nmotions. At a later period, however, viz. in 1674, Hooke resumed the\r\nsubject in a dissertation entitled “An Attempt to prove the Motion of\r\nthe Earth from Observation,” which contains the following remarkable\r\nobservations upon gravity:—\r\n\r\n“I shall hereafter explain a system of the world differing in\r\nmany particulars from any yet known, answering in all things to\r\nthe common rules of mechanical motions. This depends upon three\r\nsuppositions:—first, that all celestial bodies whatsoever have an\r\nattraction or gravitating power towards their own centres, whereby\r\nthey attract, not only their own parts, and keep them from flying\r\nfrom them, as we may observe the earth to do, but that they also do\r\nattract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of\r\ntheir activity, and consequently, that not only the sun and moon have\r\nan influence upon the body and motion of the earth, and the earth upon\r\nthem, but that Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, also, by\r\ntheir attractive powers, have a considerable influence upon its motion,\r\nas in the same manner the corresponding attractive power of the earth\r\nhath a considerable influence upon every one of their motions also.\r\nThe second supposition is this, that all bodies whatsoever that are\r\nput into a direct and simple motion will so continue to move forward\r\nin a straight line, till they are, by some other effectual powers,\r\ndeflected, and sent into a motion describing a circle, ellipsis, or\r\nsome other more compounded curve line. The third supposition is, that\r\nthose attractive powers are so much the more powerful in operating by\r\nhow much the nearer the body wrought upon is to their own centres.\r\n_Now, what these several degrees are I have not yet experimentally\r\nverified_; but it is a notion which, if fully prosecuted, as it ought\r\nto be, will mightily assist the astronomers to reduce all the celestial\r\nmotions to a certain rule, which I doubt will never be done without it.\r\nHe that understands the nature of the circular pendulum and circular\r\nmotion will easily understand the whole of this principle, and will\r\nknow where to find directions in nature for the true stating thereof.\r\nThis I only hint at present to such as have ability and opportunity of\r\nprosecuting this inquiry, and are not wanting of industry for observing\r\nand calculating, wishing heartily such may be found, having myself\r\nmany other things in hand, which I would first complete, and therefore\r\ncannot so well attend it. But this I do not promise the undertaker,\r\nthat he will find all the great motions of the world to be influenced\r\nby this principle, and that the true understanding thereof will be the\r\ntrue perfection of astronomy.”\r\n\r\nThis passage, which has been considered as a remarkable one by the\r\nphilosophers of every country, has, we think, been misapprehended by M.\r\nDelambre, when he asserts that every thing which it contains “is to be\r\nfound expressly in Kepler.”[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  _The first Idea of Gravity occurs to Newton in 1666—His first\r\n    Speculations upon it—Interrupted by his Optical Experiments—He\r\n    resumes the Subject in consequence of a Discussion with Dr. Hooke—\r\n    He discovers the true Law of Gravity and the Cause of the Planetary\r\n    Motions—Dr. Halley urges him to publish his Principia—His\r\n    Principles of Natural Philosophy—Proceedings of the Royal Society\r\n    on this Subject—The Principia appears in 1687—General Account\r\n    of it, and of the Discoveries it contains—They meet with great\r\n    Opposition, owing to the Prevalence of the Cartesian System—Account\r\n    of the Reception and Progress of the Newtonian Philosophy in foreign\r\n    Countries—Account of its Progress and Establishment in England._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief sketch of the labours and lives of those illustrious\r\nmen who prepared the science of astronomy for the application of\r\nNewton’s genius. Copernicus had determined the arrangement and general\r\nmovements of the planetary bodies: Kepler had proved that they moved\r\nin elliptical orbits; that their _radii vectores_ described arcs\r\nproportional to the times; and that their periodic times were related\r\nto their distances. Galileo had added to the universe a whole system of\r\nsecondary planets; and several astronomers had distinctly referred the\r\nmotion of the heavenly bodies to the power of attraction.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1666, when the plague had driven Newton from Cambridge,\r\nhe was sitting alone in the garden at Woolsthorpe, and reflecting on\r\nthe nature of gravity,—that remarkable power which causes all bodies\r\nto descend towards the centre of the earth. As this power is not found\r\nto suffer any sensible diminution at the greatest distance from the\r\nearth’s centre to which we can reach, being as powerful at the tops\r\nof the highest mountains as at the bottom of the deepest mines, he\r\nconceived it highly probable, that it must extend much farther than was\r\nusually supposed. No sooner had this happy conjecture occurred to his\r\nmind, than he considered what would be the effect of its extending as\r\nfar as the moon. That her motion must be influenced by such a power he\r\ndid not for a moment doubt; and a little reflection convinced him that\r\nit might be sufficient for retaining that luminary in her orbit round\r\nthe earth. Though the force of gravity suffers no sensible diminution\r\nat those small distances from the earth’s centre at which we can place\r\nourselves, yet he thought it very possible, that, at the distance of\r\nthe moon, it might differ much in strength from what it is on the\r\nearth. In order to form some estimate of the degree of its diminution,\r\nhe considered that, if the moon be retained in her orbit by the force\r\nof gravity, the primary planets must also be carried round the sun by\r\nthe same power; and by comparing the periods of the different planets\r\nwith their distances from the sun, he found, that if they were retained\r\nin their orbits by any power like gravity, its force must decrease in\r\nthe duplicate proportion,[41] or as the squares of their distances\r\nfrom the sun. In drawing this conclusion, he supposed the planets to\r\nmove in orbits perfectly circular, and having the sun in their centre.\r\nHaving thus obtained the law of the force by which the planets were\r\ndrawn to the sun, his next object was to ascertain if such a force,\r\nemanating from the earth and directed to the moon, was sufficient, when\r\ndiminished in the duplicate ratio of the distance, to retain her in her\r\norbit. In performing this calculation, it was necessary to compare the\r\nspace through which heavy bodies fall in a second at a given distance\r\nfrom the centre of the earth, viz. at its surface, with the space\r\nthrough which the moon, as it were, falls to the earth in a second of\r\ntime while revolving in a circular orbit. Being at a distance from\r\nbooks when he made this computation, he adopted the common estimate of\r\nthe earth’s diameter then in use among geographers and navigators, and\r\nsupposed that each degree of latitude contained sixty English miles. In\r\nthis way he found that the force which retains the moon in her orbit,\r\nas deduced from the force which occasions the fall of heavy bodies to\r\nthe earth’s surface, was one-sixth greater than that which is actually\r\nobserved in her circular orbit. This difference threw a doubt upon all\r\nhis speculations; but, unwilling to abandon what seemed to be otherwise\r\nso plausible, he endeavoured to account for the difference of the two\r\nforces, by supposing that some other cause[42] must have been united\r\nwith the force of gravity in producing so great a velocity of the moon\r\nin her circular orbit. As this new cause, however, was beyond the reach\r\nof observation, he discontinued all further inquiries into the subject,\r\nand concealed from his friends the speculations in which he had been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to Cambridge in 1666, his attention was occupied\r\nwith those optical discoveries of which we have given an account in\r\na preceding chapter; but he had no sooner brought them to a close\r\nthan his mind reverted to the great subject of the planetary motions.\r\nUpon the death of Oldenburg in August, 1678, Dr. Hooke was appointed\r\nsecretary to the Royal Society; and as this learned body had requested\r\nthe opinion of Newton about a system of physical astronomy, he\r\naddressed a letter to Dr. Hooke on the 28th November, 1679. In this\r\nletter he proposed a direct experiment for verifying the motion of\r\nthe earth, viz. by observing whether or not bodies that fall from a\r\nconsiderable height descend in a vertical direction, for if the earth\r\nwere at rest the body would describe exactly a vertical line, whereas\r\nif it revolved round its axis, the falling body must deviate from the\r\nvertical line towards the east. The Royal Society attached great value\r\nto the idea thus casually suggested; and Dr. Hooke was appointed to put\r\nit to the test of experiment. Being thus led to consider the subject\r\nmore attentively, he wrote to Newton, that wherever the direction of\r\ngravity was oblique to the axis on which the earth revolved, that is,\r\nin every part of the earth except the equator, falling bodies should\r\napproach to the equator, and the deviation from the vertical, in place\r\nof being exactly to the east, as Newton maintained, should be to the\r\nsouth-east of the point from which the body began to move. Newton\r\nacknowledged that this conclusion was correct in theory, and Dr. Hooke\r\nis said to have given an experimental demonstration of it before the\r\nRoyal Society in December, 1679.[43] Newton had erroneously concluded\r\nthat the path of the falling body would be a spiral; but Dr. Hooke,\r\non the same occasion on which he made the preceding experiment, read\r\na paper to the Society, in which he proved that the path of the body\r\nwould be an eccentric ellipse in vacuo, and an ellipti-spiral, if the\r\nbody moved in a resisting medium.[44]\r\n\r\nThis correction of Newton’s error, and the discovery that a projectile\r\nwould move in an elliptical orbit when under the influence of a force\r\nvarying in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance, led Newton,\r\nas he himself informs us in his letter to Halley,[45] to discover\r\n“the theorem by which he afterward examined the ellipsis,” and to\r\ndemonstrate the celebrated proposition, that a planet acted upon by an\r\nattractive force varying inversely as the squares of the distances will\r\ndescribe an elliptical orbit, in one of whose foci the attractive force\r\nresides.\r\n\r\nBut though Newton had thus discovered the true cause of all the\r\ncelestial motions, he did not yet possess any evidence that such a\r\nforce actually resided in the sun and planets. The failure of his\r\nformer attempt to identify the law of falling bodies at the earth’s\r\nsurface with that which guided the moon in her orbit threw a doubt over\r\nall his speculations, and prevented him from giving any account of them\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\nAn accident, however, of a very interesting nature induced him to\r\nresume his former inquiries, and enabled him to bring them to a close.\r\nIn June, 1682, when he was attending a meeting of the Royal Society\r\nof London, the measurement of a degree of the meridian, executed by\r\nM. Picard in 1679, became the subject of conversation. Newton took a\r\nmemorandum of the result obtained by the French astronomer, and having\r\ndeduced from it the diameter of the earth, he immediately resumed his\r\ncalculation of 1665, and began to repeat it with these new data. In\r\nthe progress of the calculation he saw that the result which he had\r\nformerly expected was likely to be produced, and he was thrown into\r\nsuch a state of nervous irritability that he was unable to carry on\r\nthe calculation. In this state of mind he intrusted it to one of his\r\nfriends, and he had the high satisfaction of finding his former views\r\namply realized. The force of gravity which regulated the fall of bodies\r\nat the earth’s surface, when diminished as the square of the moon’s\r\ndistance from the earth, was found to be almost exactly equal to the\r\ncentrifugal force of the moon as deduced from her observed distance and\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nThe influence of such a result upon such a mind may be more easily\r\nconceived than described. The whole material universe was spread out\r\nbefore him;—the sun with all his attending planets;—the planets with\r\nall their satellites;—the comets wheeling in every direction in their\r\neccentric orbits;—and the systems of the fixed stars stretching to the\r\nremotest limits of space. All the varied and complicated movements of\r\nthe heavens, in short, must have been at once presented to his mind, as\r\nthe necessary result of that law which he had established in reference\r\nto the earth and the moon.\r\n\r\nAfter extending this law to the other bodies of the system, he composed\r\na series of propositions on the motion of the primary planets about the\r\nsun, which were sent to London about the end of 1683, and were soon\r\nafterward communicated to the Royal Society.[46]\r\n\r\nAbout this period other philosophers had been occupied with the same\r\nsubject. Sir Christopher Wren had many years before endeavoured to\r\nexplain the planetary motions “by the composition of a descent towards\r\nthe sun, and an impressed motion; but he at length gave it over,\r\nnot finding the means of doing it.” In January, 1683–4, Dr. Halley\r\nhad concluded, from Kepler’s Law of the Periods and Distances, that\r\nthe centripetal force decreased in the reciprocal proportion of the\r\nsquares of the distances, and having one day met Sir Christopher Wren\r\nand Dr. Hooke, the latter affirmed that he had demonstrated upon that\r\nprinciple all the laws of the celestial motions. Dr. Halley confessed\r\nthat his attempts were unsuccessful, and Sir Christopher, in order to\r\nencourage the inquiry, offered to present a book of forty shillings’\r\nvalue to either of the two philosophers who should, in the space of two\r\nmonths, bring him a convincing demonstration of it. Hooke persisted in\r\nthe declaration that he possessed the method, but avowed it to be his\r\nintention to conceal it for some time. He promised, however, to show\r\nit to Sir Christopher; but there is every reason to believe that this\r\npromise was never fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1684, Dr. Halley went to Cambridge for the express purpose\r\nof consulting Newton on this interesting subject. Newton assured him\r\nthat he had brought this demonstration to perfection, and promised\r\nhim a copy of it. This copy was received in November by the doctor,\r\nwho made a second visit to Cambridge, in order to induce its author\r\nto have it inserted in the register book of the society. On the 10th\r\nof December, Dr. Halley announced to the society, that he had seen\r\nat Cambridge Mr. Newton’s treatise _De Motu Corporum_, which he had\r\npromised to send to the society to be entered upon their register;\r\nand Dr. Halley was desired to unite with Mr. Paget, master of the\r\nmathematical school in Christ’s Hospital, in reminding Mr. Newton of\r\nhis promise “for securing the invention to himself till such time as\r\nhe can be at leisure to publish it.” On the 25th February Mr. Aston,\r\nthe secretary, communicated a letter from Mr. Newton, in which he\r\nexpressed his willingness “to enter in the register his notions about\r\nmotion, and his intentions to fit them suddenly for the press.” The\r\nprogress of his work was, however, interrupted by a visit of five or\r\nsix weeks which he made in Lincolnshire; but he proceeded with such\r\ndiligence on his return, that he was able to transmit the manuscript to\r\nLondon before the end of April. This manuscript, entitled _Philosophiæ\r\nNaturalis Principia Mathematica_, and dedicated to the society, was\r\npresented by Dr. Vincent on the 28th April, 1686, when Sir John\r\nHoskins, the vice-president, and the particular friend of Dr. Hooke,\r\nwas in the chair. Dr. Vincent passed a just encomium on the novelty\r\nand dignity of the subject; and another member added, that “Mr. Newton\r\nhad carried the thing so far, that there was no more to be added.” To\r\nthese remarks the vice-president replied, that the method “was so much\r\nthe more to be prized as it was both invented and perfected at the\r\nsame time.” Dr. Hooke took offence at these remarks, and blamed Sir\r\nJohn for not having mentioned “what he had discovered to him;” but\r\nthe vice-president did not seem to recollect any such communication,\r\nand the consequence of this discussion was, that “these two, who till\r\nthen were the most inseparable cronies, have since scarcely seen one\r\nanother, and are utterly fallen out.” After the breaking up of the\r\nmeeting, the society adjourned to the coffee-house, where Dr. Hooke\r\nstated that he not only had made the same discovery, but had given the\r\nfirst hint of it to Newton.\r\n\r\nAn account of these proceedings was communicated to Newton through two\r\ndifferent channels. In a letter dated May 22d, Dr. Halley wrote to him\r\n“that Mr. Hooke has some pretensions upon the invention of the rule\r\nof the decrease of gravity being reciprocally as the squares of the\r\ndistances from the centre. He says you had the notion from him, though\r\nhe owns the demonstration of the curves generated thereby to be wholly\r\nyour own. How much of this is so you know best, as likewise what you\r\nhave to do in this matter. Only Mr. Hooke seems to expect you would\r\nmake some mention of him in the preface, which it is possible you may\r\nsee reason to prefix.”\r\n\r\nThis communication from Dr. Halley induced our author, on the 20th\r\nJune, to address a long letter to him, in which he gives a minute\r\nand able refutation of Hooke’s claims; but before this letter was\r\ndespatched, another correspondent, who had received his information\r\nfrom one of the members that were present, informed Newton “that Hooke\r\nmade a great stir, pretending that he had all from him, and desiring\r\nthey would see that he had justice done him.” This fresh charge seems\r\nto have ruffled the tranquillity of Newton; and he accordingly added an\r\nangry and satirical postscript, in which he treats Hooke with little\r\nceremony, and goes so far as to conjecture that Hooke might have\r\nacquired his knowledge of the law from a letter of his own to Huygens,\r\ndirected to Oldenburg, and dated January 14th, 1672–3. “My letter to\r\nHugenius was directed to Mr. Oldenburg, who used to keep the originals.\r\nHis papers came into Mr. Hooke’s possession. Mr. Hooke, knowing my\r\nhand, might have the curiosity to look into that letter, and there take\r\nthe notion of comparing the forces of the planets arising from their\r\ncircular motion; and so what he wrote to me afterward about the rate of\r\ngravity might be nothing but the fruit of my own garden.”\r\n\r\nIn replying to this letter, Dr. Halley assured him that Hooke’s “manner\r\nof claiming the discovery had been represented to him in worse colours\r\nthan it ought, and that he neither made public application to the\r\nsociety for justice, nor pretended that you had all from him.” The\r\neffect of this assurance was to make Newton regret that he had written\r\nthe angry postscript to his letter; and in replying to Halley on the\r\n14th July, 1686, he not only expresses his regret, but recounts the\r\ndifferent new ideas which he had acquired from Hooke’s correspondence,\r\nand suggests it as the best method “of compromising the present\r\ndispute,” to add a scholium, in which Wren, Hooke, and Halley are\r\nacknowledged to have independently deduced the law of gravity from the\r\nsecond law of Kepler.[47]\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the 28th April, at which the manuscript of the\r\n_Principia_ was presented to the Royal Society, it was agreed that the\r\nprinting of it should be referred to the council; that a letter of\r\nthanks should be written to its author; and at a meeting of the council\r\non the 19th May, it was resolved that the MSS. should be printed at\r\nthe society’s expense, and that Dr. Halley should superintend it while\r\ngoing through the press. These resolutions were communicated by Dr.\r\nHalley in a letter dated the 22d May; and in Newton’s reply on the 20th\r\nJune already mentioned, he makes the following observations: “The\r\nproof you sent me I like very well. I designed the whole to consist of\r\nthree books; the second was finished last summer, being short, and only\r\nwants transcribing, and drawing the cuts fairly. Some new propositions\r\nI have since thought on, which I can as well let alone. The third wants\r\nthe theory of comets. In autumn last I spent two months in calculation\r\nto no purpose for want of a good method, which made me afterward return\r\nto the first book, and enlarge it with diverse propositions, some\r\nrelating to comets, others to other things found out last winter. The\r\nthird I now design to suppress. Philosophy is such an impertinently\r\nlitigious lady, that a man had as good be engaged in lawsuits as have\r\nto do with her. I found it so formerly, and now I can no sooner come\r\nnear her again but she gives me warning. The first two books without\r\nthe third will not so well bear the title of _Philosophiæ Naturalis\r\nPrincipia Mathematica_; and therefore I had altered it to this, _De\r\nMotu Corporum Libri duo_. But after second thoughts I retain the former\r\ntitle. It will help the sale of the book, which I ought not to diminish\r\nnow ’tis yours.”\r\n\r\nIn replying to this letter on the 29th June, Dr. Halley regrets that\r\nour author’s tranquillity should have been thus disturbed by envious\r\nrivals; and implores him in the name of the society not to suppress\r\nthe third book. “I must again beg you,” says he, “not to let your\r\nresentments run so high as to deprive us of your third book, wherein\r\nyour applications of your mathematical doctrine to the theory of\r\ncomets, and several curious experiments, which, as I guess by what you\r\nwrite ought to compose it, will undoubtedly render it acceptable to\r\nthose who will call themselves philosophers without mathematics, which\r\nare much the greater number.”\r\n\r\nTo these solicitations Newton seems to have readily yielded. His second\r\nbook was sent to the society, and presented on the 2d March, 1686–7.\r\nThe third book was also transmitted, and presented on the 6th April,\r\nand the whole work was completed and published in the month of May,\r\n1687.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of the publication of a work which is\r\nmemorable, not only in the annals of one science or of one country, but\r\nwhich will form an epoch in the history of the world, and will ever be\r\nregarded as the brightest page in the records of human reason. We shall\r\nendeavour to convey to the reader some idea of its contents, and of the\r\nbrilliant discoveries which it disseminated over Europe.\r\n\r\nThe _Principia_ consists of three books. The first and second, which\r\noccupy three-fourths of the work, are entitled, _On the Motion of\r\nBodies_; and the third bears the title, _On the System of the World_.\r\nThe first two books contain the mathematical principles of philosophy,\r\nnamely, the laws and conditions of motions and forces; and they are\r\nillustrated with several philosophical scholia, which treat of some of\r\nthe most general and best established points in philosophy, such as the\r\ndensity and resistance of bodies, spaces void of matter, and the motion\r\nof sound and light. The object of the third book is to deduce from\r\nthese principles the constitution of the system of the world; and this\r\nbook has been drawn up in as popular a style as possible, in order that\r\nit may be generally read.\r\n\r\nThe great discovery which characterizes the Principia is that of the\r\nprinciple of universal gravitation, as deduced from the motion of the\r\nmoon, and from the three great facts or laws discovered by Kepler.\r\nThis principle is, _that every particle of matter is attracted by, or\r\ngravitates to, every other particle of matter, with a force inversely\r\nproportional to the squares of their distances_. From the first law of\r\nKepler, namely, the proportionality of the areas to the times of their\r\ndescription, Newton inferred that the force which kept the planet in\r\nits orbit was always directed to the sun; and from the second law of\r\nKepler, that every planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of\r\nits foci, he drew the still more general inference, that the force\r\nby which the planet moves round that focus varies inversely as the\r\nsquare of its distance from the focus. As this law was true in the\r\nmotion of satellites round their primary planets, Newton deduced the\r\nequality of gravity in all the heavenly bodies towards the sun, upon\r\nthe supposition that they are equally distant from its centre; and in\r\nthe case of terrestrial bodies, he succeeded in verifying this truth by\r\nnumerous and accurate experiments.\r\n\r\nBy taking a more general view of the subject, Newton demonstrated\r\nthat a conic section was the only curve in which a body could move\r\nwhen acted upon by a force varying inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance; and he established the conditions depending on the velocity\r\nand the primitive position of the body, which were requisite to make it\r\ndescribe a circular, an elliptical, a parabolic, or a hyperbolic orbit.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the generality and importance of these results, it\r\nstill remained to be determined whether the force resided in the\r\ncentres of the planets, or belonged to each individual particle\r\nof which they were composed. Newton removed this uncertainty by\r\ndemonstrating, that if a spherical body acts upon a distant body with\r\na force varying as the distance of this body from the centre of the\r\nsphere, the same effect will be produced as if each of its particles\r\nacted upon the distant body according to the same law. And hence it\r\nfollows that the spheres, whether they are of uniform density, or\r\nconsist of concentric layers, with densities varying according to\r\nany law whatever, will act upon each other in the same manner as if\r\ntheir force resided in their centres alone. But as the bodies of the\r\nsolar system are very nearly spherical, they will all act upon one\r\nanother, and upon bodies placed on their surface, as if they were so\r\nmany centres of attraction; and therefore we obtain the law of gravity\r\nwhich subsists between spherical bodies, namely, that one sphere will\r\nact upon another with a force directly proportional to the quantity of\r\nmatter, and inversely as the square of the distance between the centres\r\nof the spheres. From the equality of action and reaction, to which no\r\nexception can be found, Newton concluded that the sun gravitated to the\r\nplanets, and the planets to their satellites; and the earth itself to\r\nthe stone which falls upon its surface; and, consequently, that the two\r\nmutually gravitating bodies approached to one another with velocities\r\ninversely proportional to their quantities of matter.\r\n\r\nHaving established this universal law, Newton was enabled, not only to\r\ndetermine the weight which the same body would have at the surface of\r\nthe sun and the planets, but even to calculate the quantity of matter\r\nin the sun, and in all the planets that had satellites, and even to\r\ndetermine the density or specific gravity of the matter of which they\r\nwere composed. In this way he found that the weight of the same body\r\nwould be twenty-three times greater at the surface of the sun than at\r\nthe surface of the earth, and that the density of the earth was four\r\ntimes greater than that of the sun, the planets increasing in density\r\nas they receded from the centre of the system.\r\n\r\nIf the peculiar genius of Newton has been displayed in his\r\ninvestigation of the law of universal gravitation, it shines with no\r\nless lustre in the patience and sagacity with which he traced the\r\nconsequences of this fertile principle.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the spheroidal form of Jupiter by Cassini had probably\r\ndirected the attention of Newton to the determination of its cause, and\r\nconsequently to the investigation of the true figure of the earth. The\r\nspherical form of the planets have been ascribed by Copernicus to the\r\ngravity or natural appetency of their parts; but upon considering the\r\nearth as a body revolving upon its axis, Newton quickly saw that the\r\nfigure arising from the mutual attraction of its parts must be modified\r\nby another force arising from its rotation. When a body revolves upon\r\nan axis, the velocity of rotation increases from the poles, where it\r\nis nothing, to the equator, where it is a maximum. In consequence of\r\nthis velocity the bodies on the earth’s surface have a tendency to\r\nfly off from it, and this tendency increases with the velocity. Hence\r\narises a centrifugal force which acts in combination with a force of\r\ngravity, and which Newton found to be the 289th part of the force of\r\ngravity at the equator, and decreasing, as the cosine of the latitude,\r\nfrom the equator to the poles. The great predominance of gravity over\r\nthe centrifugal force prevents the latter from carrying off any bodies\r\nfrom the earth’s surface, but the weight of all bodies is diminished\r\nby the centrifugal force, so that the weight of any body is greater at\r\nthe poles than it is at the equator. If we now suppose the waters at\r\nthe pole to communicate with those at the equator by means of a canal,\r\none branch of which goes from the pole to the centre of the earth,\r\nand the other from the centre of the earth to the equator, then the\r\npolar branch of the canal will be heavier than the equatorial branch,\r\nin consequence of its weight not being diminished by the centrifugal\r\nforce, and, therefore, in order that the two columns may be in\r\nequilibrio, the equatorial one must be lengthened. Newton found that\r\nthe length of the polar must be to that of the equatorial canal as 229\r\nto 230, or that the earth’s polar radius must be seventeen miles less\r\nthan its equatorial radius; that is, that the figure of the earth is\r\nan oblate spheroid, formed by the revolution of an ellipse round its\r\nlesser axis. Hence it follows, that the intensity of gravity at any\r\npoint of the earth’s surface is in the inverse ratio of the distance of\r\nthat point from the centre, and, consequently, that it diminishes from\r\nthe equator to the poles,—a result which he confirmed by the fact, that\r\nclocks required to have their pendulums shortened in order to beat true\r\ntime when carried from Europe towards the equator.\r\n\r\nThe next subject to which Newton applied the principle of gravity was\r\nthe tides of the ocean. The philosophers of all ages have recognised\r\nthe connexion between the phenomena of the tides and the position\r\nof the moon. The College of Jesuits at Coimbra, and subsequently\r\nAntonio de Dominis and Kepler, distinctly referred the tides to the\r\nattraction of the waters of the earth by the moon, but so imperfect was\r\nthe explanation which was thus given of the phenomena, that Galileo\r\nridiculed the idea of lunar attraction, and substituted for it a\r\nfallacious explanation of his own. That the moon is the principal cause\r\nof the tides is obvious from the well-known fact, that it is high water\r\nat any given place about the time when she is in the meridian of that\r\nplace; and that the sun performs a secondary part in their production\r\nmay be proved from the circumstance, that the highest tides take place\r\nwhen the sun, the moon, and the earth are in the same straight line,\r\nthat is, when the force of the sun conspires with that of the moon,\r\nand that the lowest tides take place when the lines drawn from the\r\nsun and moon to the earth are at right angles to each other, that is,\r\nwhen the force of the sun acts in opposition to that of the moon. The\r\nmost perplexing phenomenon in the tides of the ocean, and one which\r\nis still a stumbling-block to persons slightly acquainted with the\r\ntheory of attraction, is the existence of high water on the side of the\r\nearth opposite to the moon, as well as on the side next the moon. To\r\nmaintain that the attraction of the moon at the same instant draws the\r\nwaters of the ocean towards herself, and also draws them from the earth\r\nin an opposite direction, seems at first sight paradoxical; but the\r\ndifficulty vanishes when we consider the earth, or rather the centre of\r\nthe earth, and the water on each side of it as three distinct bodies\r\nplaced at different distances from the moon, and consequently attracted\r\nwith forces inversely proportional to the squares of their distances.\r\nThe water nearest the moon will be much more powerfully attracted than\r\nthe centre of the earth, and the centre of the earth more powerfully\r\nthan the water farthest from the moon. The consequence of this must be,\r\nthat the waters nearest the moon will be drawn away from the centre\r\nof the earth, and will consequently rise from their level, while the\r\ncentre of the earth will be drawn away from the waters opposite the\r\nmoon, which will, as it were, be left behind, and consequently be in\r\nthe same situation as if they were raised from the earth in a direction\r\nopposite to that in which they are attracted by the moon. Hence the\r\neffect of the moon’s action upon the earth is to draw its fluid parts\r\ninto the form of an oblong spheroid, the axis of which passes through\r\nthe moon. As the action of the sun will produce the very same effect,\r\nthough in a smaller degree, the tide at any place will depend on the\r\nrelative position of these two spheroids, and will be always equal\r\neither to the sum or to the difference of the effects of the two\r\nluminaries. At the time of new and full moon the two spheroids will\r\nhave their axes coincident, and the height of the tide, which will then\r\nbe a _spring_ one, will be equal to the sum of the elevations produced\r\nin each spheroid considered separately, while at the first and third\r\nquarters the axes of the spheroids will be at right angles to each\r\nother, and the height of the tide, which will then be a _neap_ one,\r\nwill be equal to the difference of the elevations produced in each\r\nseparate spheroid. By comparing the spring and neap tides, Newton found\r\nthat the force with which the sun acted upon the waters of the earth\r\nwas to that with which the sun acted upon them as 4.48 to 1;—that the\r\nforce of the moon produced a tide of 8.63 feet;—that of the sun one of\r\n1.93 feet;—and both of them combined, one of 10½ French feet,—a result\r\nwhich in the open sea does not deviate much from observation. Having\r\nthus ascertained the force of the moon on the waters of our globe, he\r\nfound that the quantity of matter in the moon was to that in the earth\r\nas 1 to 40, and the density of the moon to that of the earth as 11 to 9.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the moon, so much within the reach of our own\r\nobservation, presented a fine field for the application of the theory\r\nof universal gravitation. The irregularities exhibited in the lunar\r\nmotions had been known in the time of Hipparchus and Ptolemy. Tycho\r\nhad discovered the great inequality called the _variation_, amounting\r\nto 37′, and depending on the alternate acceleration and retardation of\r\nthe moon in every quarter of a revolution, and he had also ascertained\r\nthe existence of the annual equation. Of these two inequalities Newton\r\ngave a most satisfactory explanation. The action of the sun upon the\r\nmoon may be always resolved into two, one acting in the direction\r\nof the line joining the moon and earth, and consequently tending to\r\nincrease or diminish the moon’s gravity to the earth, and the other\r\nin a direction at right angles to this, and consequently tending to\r\naccelerate or retard the motion in her orbit. Now, it was found by\r\nNewton that this last force was reduced to nothing, or vanished at\r\nthe syzigies or quadratures, so that at these four points the moon\r\ndescribed areas proportional to the times. The instant, however, that\r\nthe moon quits these positions, the force under consideration, which\r\nwe may call the tangential force, begins, and it reaches its maximum\r\nin the four octants. The force, therefore, compounded of these two\r\nelements of the solar force, or the diagonal of the parallelogram\r\nwhich they form, is no longer directed to the earth’s centre, but\r\ndeviates from it at a maximum about 30 minutes, and therefore affects\r\nthe angular motion of the moon, the motion being accelerated in passing\r\nfrom the quadratures to the syzigies, and retarded in passing from\r\nthe syzigies to the quadratures. Hence the velocity is in its mean\r\nstate in the octants, a maximum in the syzigies, and a minimum in the\r\nquadratures.\r\n\r\nUpon considering the influence of the solar force in diminishing\r\nor increasing the moon’s gravity to the earth, Newton saw that her\r\ndistance and her periodic time must from this cause be subject to\r\nchange, and in this way he accounted for the annual equation observed\r\nby Tycho. By the application of similar principles, he explained the\r\ncause of the motion of the apsides, or of the greater axis of the\r\nmoon’s orbit, which has an angular progressive motion of 3° 4′ nearly\r\nin the course of one lunation; and he showed that the retrogradation of\r\nthe nodes, amounting to 3′ 10″ daily, arose from one of the elements\r\nof the solar force being exerted in the plane of the ecliptic, and not\r\nin the plane of the moon’s orbit, the effect of which was to draw the\r\nmoon down to the plane of the ecliptic, and thus cause the line of the\r\nnodes, or the intersection of these two planes, to move in a direction\r\nopposite to that of the moon. The lunar theory thus blocked out by\r\nNewton, required for its completion the labours of another century. The\r\nimperfections of the fluxionary calculus prevented him from explaining\r\nthe other inequalities of the moon’s motions, and it was reserved to\r\nEuler, D’Alembert, Clairaut, Mayer, and Laplace to bring the lunar\r\ntables to a high degree of perfection, and to enable the navigator to\r\ndetermine his longitude at sea with a degree of precision which the\r\nmost sanguine astronomer could scarcely have anticipated.\r\n\r\nBy the consideration of the retrograde motion of the moon’s nodes,\r\nNewton was led to discover the cause of the remarkable phenomenon of\r\nthe precession of the equinoctial points, which moved 50″ annually,\r\nand completed the circuit of the heavens in 25,920 years. Kepler had\r\ndeclared himself incapable of assigning any cause for this motion, and\r\nwe do not believe that any other astronomer ever made the attempt.\r\nFrom the spheroidal form of the earth, it may be regarded as a sphere\r\nwith a spheroidal ring surrounding its equator, one-half of the ring\r\nbeing above the plane of the ecliptic and the other half below it.\r\nConsidering this excess of matter as a system of satellites adhering\r\nto the earth’s surface, Newton saw that the combined actions of the\r\nsun and moon upon these satellites tended to produce a retrogradation\r\nin the nodes of the circles which they described in their diurnal\r\nrotation, and that the sum of all the tendencies being communicated to\r\nthe whole mass of the planet, ought to produce a slow retrogradation of\r\nthe equinoctial points. The effect produced by the motion of the sun he\r\nfound to be 40″, and that produced by the action of the moon 10″.\r\n\r\nAlthough there could be little doubt that the comets were retained\r\nin their orbits by the same laws which regulated the motions of the\r\nplanets, yet it was difficult to put this opinion to the test of\r\nobservation. The visibility of comets only in a small part of their\r\norbits rendered it difficult to ascertain their distance and periodic\r\ntimes, and as their periods were probably of great length, it was\r\nimpossible to correct approximate results by repeated observation.\r\nNewton, however, removed this difficulty, by showing how to determine\r\nthe orbit of a comet, namely, the form and position of the orbit and\r\nthe periodic time, by three observations. By applying this method to\r\nthe comet of 1680, he calculated the elements of its orbit, and from\r\nthe agreement of the computed places with those which were observed,\r\nhe justly inferred that the motions of comets were regulated by the\r\nsame laws as those of the planetary bodies. This result was one of\r\ngreat importance; for as the comets enter our system in every possible\r\ndirection, and at all angles with the ecliptic, and as a great part\r\nof their orbits extend far beyond the limits of the solar system, it\r\ndemonstrated the existence of gravity in spaces far removed beyond the\r\nplanet, and proved that the law of the inverse ratio of the squares of\r\nthe distance was true in every possible direction, and at very remote\r\ndistances from the centre of our system.[48]\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief view of the leading discoveries which the _Principia_\r\nfirst announced to the world. The grandeur of the subjects of which\r\nit treats, the beautiful simplicity of the system which it unfolds,\r\nthe clear and concise reasoning by which that system is explained, and\r\nthe irresistible evidence by which it is supported might have ensured\r\nit the warmest admiration of contemporary mathematicians, and the\r\nmost welcome reception in all the schools of philosophy throughout\r\nEurope. This, however, is not the way in which great truths are\r\ngenerally received. Though the astronomical discoveries of Newton were\r\nnot assailed by the class of ignorant pretenders who attacked his\r\noptical writings, yet they were every where resisted by the errors and\r\nprejudices which had taken a deep hold even of the strongest minds. The\r\nphilosophy of Descartes was predominant throughout Europe. Appealing\r\nto the imagination, and not to the reason of mankind, it was quickly\r\nreceived into popular favour, and the same causes which facilitated\r\nits introduction extended its influence, and completed its dominion\r\nover the human mind. In explaining all the movements of the heavenly\r\nbodies by a system of vortices in a fluid medium diffused through the\r\nuniverse, Descartes had seized upon an analogy of the most alluring\r\nand deceitful kind. Those who had seen heavy bodies revolving in the\r\neddies of a whirlpool, or in the gyrations of a vessel of water thrown\r\ninto a circular motion, had no difficulty in conceiving how the planets\r\nmight revolve round the sun by analogous movements. The mind instantly\r\ngrasped at an explanation of so palpable a character, and which\r\nrequired for its development neither the exercise of patient thought\r\nnor the aid of mathematical skill. The talent and perspicuity with\r\nwhich the Cartesian system was expounded, and the show of experiments\r\nwith which it was sustained, contributed powerfully to its adoption,\r\nwhile it derived a still higher sanction from the excellent character\r\nand the unaffected piety of its author.\r\n\r\nThus intrenched, as the Cartesian system was, in the strongholds of\r\nthe human mind, and fortified by its most obstinate prejudices, it\r\nwas not to be wondered at that the pure and sublime doctrines of the\r\nPrincipia were distrustfully received and perseveringly resisted. The\r\nuninstructed mind could not readily admit the idea, that the great\r\nmasses of the planets were suspended in empty space, and retained\r\nin their orbits by an invisible influence residing in the sun; and\r\neven those philosophers who had been accustomed to the rigour of true\r\nscientific research, and who possessed sufficient mathematical skill\r\nfor the examination of the Newtonian doctrines, viewed them at first\r\nas reviving the occult qualities of the ancient physics, and resisted\r\ntheir introduction with a pertinacity which it is not easy to explain.\r\nPrejudiced, no doubt, in favour of his own metaphysical views, Leibnitz\r\nhimself misapprehended the principles of the Newtonian philosophy,\r\nand endeavoured to demonstrate the truths in the Principia by the\r\napplication of different principles. Huygens, who above all other men\r\nwas qualified to appreciate the new philosophy, rejected the doctrine\r\nof gravitation as existing between the individual particles of matter,\r\nand received it only as an attribute of the planetary masses. John\r\nBernouilli, one of the first mathematicians of his age, opposed the\r\nphilosophy of Newton. Mairan, in the early part of his life, was a\r\nstrenuous defender of the system of vortices. Cassini and Maraldi were\r\nquite ignorant of the Principia, and occupied themselves with the\r\nmost absurd methods of calculating the orbits of comets long after\r\nthe Newtonian method had been established on the most impregnable\r\nfoundation; and even Fontenelle, a man of liberal views and extensive\r\ninformation, continued, throughout the whole of his life, to maintain\r\nthe doctrines of Descartes.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier Louville of Paris had adopted the Newtonian philosophy\r\nbefore 1720. S’Gravesande had introduced it into the Dutch universities\r\nat a somewhat earlier period, and Maupertuis, in consequence of a visit\r\nwhich he paid to England in 1728, became a zealous defender of it; but\r\nnotwithstanding these and some other examples that might be quoted,\r\nwe must admit the truth of the remark of Voltaire, that though Newton\r\nsurvived the publication of the Principia more than forty years, yet\r\nat the time of his death he had not above _twenty_ followers out of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the progress of the Newtonian philosophy in England,\r\nsome difference of opinion has been entertained. Professor Playfair\r\ngives the following account of it. “In the universities of England,\r\nthough the Aristotelian physics had made an obstinate resistance, they\r\nhad been supplanted by the Cartesian, which became firmly established\r\nabout the time when their foundation began to be sapped by the general\r\nprogress of science, and particularly by the discoveries of Newton. For\r\nmore than thirty years after the publication of these discoveries, the\r\nsystem of vortices kept its ground; and a translation from the French\r\ninto Latin of the _Physics_ of Rohault, a work entirely Cartesian,\r\ncontinued at Cambridge to be the text for philosophical instruction.\r\nAbout the year 1718, a new and more elegant translation of the same\r\nbook was published by Dr. Samuel Clarke, with the addition of notes, in\r\nwhich that profound and ingenious writer explained the views of Newton\r\non the principal objects of discussion, so that the notes contained\r\nvirtually a refutation of the text; they did so, however, only\r\nvirtually, all appearance of argument and controversy being carefully\r\navoided. Whether this escaped the notice of the learned doctor or not\r\nis uncertain, but the new translation, from its better Latinity, and\r\nthe name of the editor, was readily admitted to all the academical\r\nhonours which the old one had enjoyed. Thus the stratagem of Dr. Clarke\r\ncompletely succeeded; the tutor might prelect from the text, but the\r\npupil would sometimes look into the notes; and error is never so sure\r\nof being exposed as when the truth is placed close to it, side by side,\r\nwithout any thing to alarm prejudice, or awaken from its lethargy\r\nthe dread of innovation. Thus, therefore, the Newtonian philosophy\r\nfirst entered the university of Cambridge under the protection of the\r\nCartesian.” To this passage Professor Playfair adds the following as a\r\nnote:—\r\n\r\n“The universities of St. Andrew’s and Edinburgh were, I believe, the\r\nfirst in Britain where the Newtonian philosophy was made the subject\r\nof the academical prelections. For this distinction they are indebted\r\nto James and David Gregory, the first in some respects the rival, but\r\nboth the friends of Newton. Whiston bewails, in the anguish of his\r\nheart, the difference, in this respect, between those universities and\r\nhis own. David Gregory taught in Edinburgh for several years prior to\r\n1690, when he removed to Oxford; and Whiston says, ‘He had already\r\ncaused several of his scholars to keep acts, as we call them, upon\r\nseveral branches of the Newtonian philosophy, while we at Cambridge,\r\npoor wretches, were ignominiously studying the fictitious hypotheses\r\nof the Cartesians.’[49] I do not, however, mean to say, that from this\r\ndate the Cartesian philosophy was expelled from those universities;\r\nthe _Physics_ of Rohault were still in use as a text-book,—at least\r\noccasionally, to a much later period than this, and a great deal, no\r\ndoubt, depended on the character of the individual. Professor Keill\r\nintroduced the Newtonian philosophy in his lectures at Oxford in 1697;\r\nbut the instructions of the tutors, which constitute the real and\r\nefficient system of the university, were not cast in that mould till\r\nlong afterward.” Adopting the same view of the subject, Mr. Dugald\r\nStewart has stated, “that the philosophy of Newton was publicly taught\r\nby David Gregory at Edinburgh, and by his brother, James Gregory,\r\nat St. Andrew’s,[50] before it was able to supplant the vortices of\r\nDescartes in that very university of which Newton was a member. It was\r\nin the Scottish universities that the philosophy of Locke, as well as\r\nthat of Newton, was first adopted as a branch of academical education.”\r\n\r\nAnxious as we should have been to have awarded to Scotland the honour\r\nof having first adopted the Newtonian philosophy, yet a regard for\r\nhistorical truth compels us to take a different view of the subject.\r\nIt is well known that Sir Isaac Newton delivered lectures on his own\r\nphilosophy from the Lucasian chair before the publication of the\r\nPrincipia; and in the very page of Whiston’s life quoted by Professor\r\nPlayfair, he informs us that he had heard him read such lectures in the\r\npublic schools, though at that time he did not at all understand them.\r\nNewton continued to lecture till 1699, and occasionally, we presume,\r\ntill 1703, when Whiston became his successor, having been appointed\r\nhis deputy in 1699. In both of these capacities Whiston delivered in\r\nthe public schools a course of lectures on astronomy, and a course of\r\nphysico-mathematical lectures, in which the mathematical philosophy\r\nof Newton was explained and demonstrated, and both these courses\r\nwere published, the one in 1707, and the other in 1710, “for the use\r\nof the young men in the university.” In 1707, the celebrated blind\r\nmathematician Nicholas Saunderson took up his residence in Christ’s\r\nCollege without being admitted a member of that body. The society\r\nnot only allotted to him apartments, but gave him the free use of\r\ntheir library. With the concurrence of Whiston he delivered a course\r\nof lectures “on the Principia, Optics, and Universal Arithmetic of\r\nNewton,” and the popularity of these lectures was so great, that Sir\r\nIsaac corresponded on the subject of them with their author; and on the\r\nejection of Whiston from the Lucasian chair in 1711, Saunderson was\r\nappointed his successor. In this important office he continued to teach\r\nthe Newtonian philosophy till the time of his death, which took place\r\nin 1739.\r\n\r\nBut while the Newtonian philosophy was thus regularly taught in\r\nCambridge, after the publication of the Principia, there were not\r\nwanting other exertions for accelerating its progress. About 1694, the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Samuel Clarke, while an under-graduate, defended, in the\r\npublic schools, a question taken from the Newtonian philosophy; and\r\nhis translation of Rohault’s Physics, which contains references in the\r\nnotes to the Principia, and which was published in 1697 (and not in\r\n1718, as stated by Professor Playfair), shows how early the Cartesian\r\nsystem was attacked by the disciples of Newton. The author of the Life\r\nof Saunderson informs us, that public exercises or acts founded on\r\nevery part of the Newtonian system were very common about 1707, and so\r\ngeneral were such studies in the university, that the Principia rose to\r\nfour times its original price.[51] One of the most ardent votaries of\r\nthe Newtonian philosophy was Dr. Laughton, who had been tutor in Clare\r\nHall from 1694, and it is probable that during the whole, or at least\r\na greater part, of his tutorship he had inculcated the same doctrines.\r\nIn 1709–10, when he was proctor of that college, instead of appointing\r\na moderator, he discharged the office himself, and devoted his most\r\nactive exertions to the promotion of mathematical knowledge. Previous\r\nto this, he had even published a paper of questions on the Newtonian\r\nphilosophy, which appear to have been used as theses for disputations;\r\nand such was his ardour and learning that they powerfully contributed\r\nto the popularity of his college. Between 1706 and 1716, the year\r\nof his death, the celebrated Roger Cotes, the friend and disciple\r\nof Newton, filled the Plumian chair of astronomy and experimental\r\nphilosophy at Cambridge. During this period he edited the second\r\nedition of the Principia, which he enriched with an admirable preface,\r\nand thus contributed, by his writings as well as by his lectures, to\r\nadvance the philosophy of his master. About the same time, the learned\r\nDr. Bentley, who first made known the philosophy of his friend to\r\nthe readers of general literature, filled the high office of master\r\nof Trinity College, and could not fail to have exerted his utmost\r\ninfluence in propagating doctrines which he so greatly admired. Had any\r\nopposition been offered to the introduction of the true system of the\r\nuniverse, the talents and influence of these individuals would have\r\nimmediately suppressed it; but no such opposition seems to have been\r\nmade; and though there may have been individuals at Cambridge ignorant\r\nof mathematical science, who adhered to the system of Descartes, and\r\npatronised the study of the Physics of Rohault, yet it is probable\r\nthat similar persons existed in the universities of Edinburgh and St.\r\nAndrew’s; and we cannot regard their adherence to error as disproving\r\nthe general fact, that the philosophy of Newton was quickly introduced\r\ninto all the universities of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBut while the mathematical principles of the Newtonian system were ably\r\nexpounded in our seats of learning, its physical truths were generally\r\nstudied, and were explained and communicated to the public by various\r\nlecturers on experimental philosophy. The celebrated Locke, who was\r\nincapable of understanding the Principia from his want of mathematical\r\nknowledge, inquired of Huygens if all the mathematical propositions\r\nin that work were true. When he was assured that he might depend upon\r\ntheir certainty, he took them for granted, and carefully examined\r\nthe reasonings and corollaries deduced from them. In this manner he\r\nacquired a knowledge of the physical truths in the Principia, and\r\nbecame a firm believer in the discoveries which it contained. In the\r\nsame manner he studied the treatise on Optics, and made himself master\r\nof every part of it which was not mathematical.[52] From a manuscript\r\nof Sir Isaac Newton’s, entitled “A demonstration that the planets, by\r\ntheir gravity towards the sun, may move in ellipses,[53] found among\r\nthe papers of Mr. Locke, and published by Lord King,” it would appear\r\nthat he himself had been at considerable trouble in explaining to his\r\nfriend that interesting doctrine. This manuscript is endorsed, “Mr.\r\nNewton, March, 1689.” It begins with three hypotheses (the first\r\ntwo being the two laws of motion, and the third the parallelogram\r\nof motion), which introduce the proposition of the proportionality\r\nof the areas to the times in motions round an immoveable centre of\r\nattraction.[54] Three lemmas, containing properties of the ellipse,\r\nthen prepare the reader for the celebrated proposition, that when a\r\nbody moves in an ellipse,[55] the attraction is reciprocally as the\r\nsquare of the distance of the body from the focus to which it is\r\nattracted. These propositions are demonstrated in a more popular manner\r\nthan in the Principia, but there can be no doubt that, even in their\r\npresent modified form, they were beyond the capacity of Mr. Locke.\r\n\r\nDr. John Keill was the first person who publicly taught natural\r\nphilosophy by experiments. Desaguliers informs us that this author\r\n“laid down very simple propositions, which he proved by experiments,\r\nand from these he deduced others more compound, which he still\r\nconfirmed by experiments, till he had instructed his auditors in the\r\nlaws of motion, the principles of hydrostatics and optics, and some\r\nof the chief propositions of Sir Isaac Newton concerning light and\r\ncolours. He began these courses in Oxford about the year 1704 or 1705,\r\nand in that way introduced the love of the Newtonian philosophy.” When\r\nDr. Keill left the university, Desaguliers began to teach the Newtonian\r\nphilosophy by experiments. He commenced his lectures at Harthall in\r\nOxford, in 1710, and delivered more than a hundred and twenty courses;\r\nand when he went to settle in London in 1713, he informs us that he\r\nfound “the Newtonian philosophy generally received among persons of\r\nall ranks and professions, and even among the ladies by the help of\r\nexperiments.” Such were the steps by which the Newtonian philosophy\r\nwas established in Great Britain. From the time of the publication\r\nof the Principia, its mathematical doctrines formed a regular part of\r\nacademical education; and before twenty years had elapsed, its physical\r\ntruths were communicated to the public in popular lectures illustrated\r\nby experiments, and accommodated to the capacities of those who were\r\nnot versed in mathematical knowledge. The Cartesian system, though it\r\nmay have lingered for a while in the recesses of our universities, was\r\nsoon overturned; and long before his death, Newton enjoyed the high\r\nsatisfaction of seeing his philosophy triumphant in his native land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  _Doctrine of Infinite Quantities—Labours of Pappus—Kepler—Cavaleri—\r\n    Roberval—Fermat—Wallis—Newton discovers the Binomial Theorem—and\r\n    the Doctrine of Fluxions in 1666—His Manuscript Work containing\r\n    this Doctrine communicated to his Friends—His Treatise on Fluxions—\r\n    His Mathematical Tracts—His Universal Arithmetic—His Methodus\r\n    Differentialis—His Geometria Analytica—His Solution of the Problems\r\n    proposed by Bernouilli and Leibnitz—Account of the celebrated\r\n    Dispute respecting the Invention of Fluxions—Commercium Epistolicum—\r\n    Report of the Royal Society—General View of the Controversy._\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the time of Newton, the doctrine of infinite quantities had\r\nbeen the subject of profound study. The ancients made the first step in\r\nthis curious inquiry by a rude though ingenious attempt to determine\r\nthe area of curves. The method of exhaustions which was used for this\r\npurpose consisted in finding a given rectilineal area to which the\r\ninscribed and circumscribed polygonal figures continually approached\r\nby increasing the number of their sides. This area was obviously the\r\narea of the curve, and in the case of the parabola it was found by\r\nArchimedes to be two-thirds of the area formed by multiplying the\r\nordinate by the abscissa. Although the synthetical demonstration of the\r\nresults was perfectly conclusive, yet the method itself was limited and\r\nimperfect.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Pappus of Alexandria followed Archimedes in the same\r\ninquiries; and in his demonstration of the property of the centre of\r\ngravity of a plane figure, by which we may determine the solid formed\r\nby its revolution, he has shadowed forth the discoveries of later times.\r\n\r\nIn his curious tract on Stereometry, published in 1615, Kepler made\r\nsome advances in the doctrine of infinitesimals. Prompted to the task\r\nby a dispute with the seller of some casks of wine, he studied the\r\nmeasurement of solids formed by the revolution of a curve round any\r\nline whatever. In solving some of the simplest of these problems, he\r\nconceived a circle to be formed of an infinite number of triangles\r\nhaving all their vertices in the centre, and their infinitely small\r\nbases in the circumference of the circle, and by thus rendering\r\nfamiliar the idea of quantities infinitely great and infinitely small,\r\nhe gave an impulse to this branch of mathematics. The failure of\r\nKepler, too, in solving some of the more difficult of the problems\r\nwhich he himself proposed roused the attention of geometers, and seems\r\nparticularly to have attracted the notice of Cavaleri.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious mathematician was born at Milan in 1598, and was\r\nProfessor of Geometry at Bologna. In his method of Indivisibles, which\r\nwas published in 1635, he considered a line as composed of an infinite\r\nnumber of points, a surface of an infinite number of lines, and a solid\r\nof an infinite number of surfaces; and he lays it down as an axiom\r\nthat the infinite sums of such lines and surfaces have the same ratio\r\nwhen compared with the linear or superficial unit, as the surfaces and\r\nsolids which are to be determined. As it is not true that an infinite\r\nnumber of infinitely small points can make a line, or an infinite\r\nnumber of infinitely small lines a surface, Pascal removed this verbal\r\ndifficulty by considering a line as composed of an infinite number of\r\ninfinitely short lines, a surface as composed of an infinite number of\r\ninfinitely narrow parallelograms, and a solid of an infinite number\r\nof infinitely thin solids. But, independent of this correction, the\r\nconclusions deduced by Cavaleri are rigorously true, and his method of\r\nascertaining the ratios of areas and solids to one another, and the\r\ntheorems which he deduced from it may be considered as forming an era\r\nin mathematics.\r\n\r\nBy the application of this method, Roberval and Toricelli showed that\r\nthe area of the cycloid is three times that of its generating circle,\r\nand the former extended the method of Cavaleri to the case where the\r\npowers of the terms of the arithmetical progression to be summed were\r\nfractional.\r\n\r\nIn applying the doctrine of infinitely small quantities to determine\r\nthe tangents of curves, and the maxima and minima of their ordinates,\r\nboth Roberval and Fermat made a near approach to the invention of\r\nfluxions—so near indeed that both Lagrange and Laplace[56] have\r\npronounced the latter to be the true inventer of the differential\r\ncalculus. Roberval supposed the point which describes a curve to be\r\nactuated by two motions, by the composition of which it moves in the\r\ndirection of a tangent; and had he possessed the method of fluxions, he\r\ncould, in every case, have determined the relative velocities of these\r\nmotions, which depend on the nature of the curve, and consequently the\r\ndirection of the tangent which he assumed to be in the diagonal of a\r\nparallelogram whose sides had the same ratio as the velocities. But as\r\nhe was able to determine these velocities only in the conic sections,\r\n&c. his ingenious method had but few applications.\r\n\r\nThe labours of Peter Fermat, a counsellor of the parliament of\r\nToulouse, approached still nearer to the fluxionary calculus. In his\r\nmethod of determining the maxima and minima of the ordinates of curves,\r\nhe substitutes _x_ + _e_ for the independent variable _x_ in the\r\nfunction which is to become a maximum, and as these two expressions\r\nshould be equal when _e_ becomes infinitely small or 0, he frees this\r\nequation from surds and radicals, and after dividing the whole by _e_,\r\n_e_ is made = 0, and the equation for the maximum is thus obtained.\r\nUpon a similar principle he founded his method of drawing tangents to\r\ncurves. But though the methods thus used by Fermat are in principle\r\nthe same with those which connect the theory of tangents and of maxima\r\nand minima with the analytical method of exhibiting the differential\r\ncalculus, yet it is a singular example of national partiality to\r\nconsider the inventer of these methods as the inventer of the method of\r\nfluxions.\r\n\r\n“One might be led,” says Mr. Herschel, “to suppose by Laplace’s\r\nexpression that the calculus of finite differences had then already\r\nassumed a systematic form, and that Fermat had actually observed\r\nthe relation between the two calculi, and derived the one from the\r\nother. The latter conclusion would scarcely be less correct than the\r\nformer. No method can justly be regarded as bearing any analogy to the\r\ndifferential calculus which does not lay down a system of rules (no\r\nmatter on what considerations founded, by what names called, or by\r\nwhat extraneous matter enveloped) by means of which the second term of\r\nthe development of any function of _x_ + _e_ in powers of _e_, can be\r\ncorrectly calculated, ‘quæ extendet se,’ to use Newton’s expression,\r\n‘_citra_ ullum molestum calculum in terminis surdis æque ac in integris\r\nprocedens.’ It would be strange to suppose Fermat or any other in\r\npossession of such a method before any single surd quantity had ever\r\nbeen developed in a series. But, in point of fact, his writings present\r\nno trace of the kind; and this, though fatal to his claim, is allowed\r\nby both the geometers cited. Hear Lagrange’s candid avowal. ‘Il fait\r\ndisparaitre dans cette equation,’ that of the maximum between _x_\r\nand _e_, ‘les radicaux et les fractions s’il y en à.’ Laplace, too,\r\ndeclares that ‘il savoit etendre son calcul aux fonctions irrationelles\r\nen se debarrassant des irrationalités par l’elevation des radicaux\r\naux puissances.’ This is at once giving up the point in question. It\r\nis allowing unequivocally that Fermat in these processes only took a\r\ncircuitous route to avoid a difficulty which it is one of the most\r\nexpress objects of the differential calculus to face and surmount.\r\nThe whole claim of the French geometer arises from a confusion (too\r\noften made) of the calculus and its applications, the means and the\r\nend, under the sweeping head of ‘nouveaux calculs’ on the one hand,\r\nand an assertion somewhat too unqualified, advanced in the warmth and\r\ngenerality of a preface, on the other.”[57]\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Fermat were improved and simplified by Hudde,\r\nHuygens, and Barrow; and by the publication of the _Arithmetic of\r\nInfinites_ by Dr. Wallis, Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford,\r\nmathematicians were conducted to the very entrance of a new and\r\nuntrodden field of discovery. This distinguished author had effected\r\nthe quadrature of all curves whose ordinates can be expressed by any\r\ndirect integral powers; and though he had extended his conclusions\r\nto the cases where the ordinates are expressed by the inverse or\r\nfractional powers, yet he failed in its application. Nicolas Mercator\r\n(Kauffman) surmounted the difficulty by which Wallis had been baffled,\r\nby the continued division of the numerator by the denominator to\r\ninfinity, and then applying Wallis’s method to the resulting positive\r\npowers. In this way he obtained, in 1667, the first general quadrature\r\nof the hyperbola, and, at the same time, gave the regular development\r\nof a function in series.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the quadrature of the circle, Dr. Wallis considered\r\nthat if the equations of the curves of which he had given the\r\nquadrature were arranged in a series, beginning with the most simple,\r\nthese areas would form another series. He saw also that the equation of\r\nthe circle was intermediate between the first and second terms of the\r\nfirst series, or between the equation of a straight line and that of a\r\nparabola, and hence he concluded, that by interpolating a term between\r\nthe first and second term of the second series, he would obtain the\r\narea of the circle. In pursuing this singularly beautiful thought, Dr.\r\nWallis did not succeed in obtaining the indefinite quadrature of the\r\ncircle, because he did not employ general exponents; but he was led to\r\nexpress the entire area of the circle by a fraction, the numerator and\r\ndenominator of which are each obtained by the continued multiplication\r\nof a certain series of numbers.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of this branch of mathematical science, when\r\nNewton, at an early age, directed to it the vigour of his mind. At\r\nthe very beginning of his mathematical studies, when the works of\r\nDr. Wallis fell into his hands, he was led to consider how he could\r\ninterpolate the general values of the areas in the second series of\r\nthat mathematician. With this view he investigated the arithmetical\r\nlaw of the coefficients of the series, and obtained a general method\r\nof interpolating, not only the series above referred to, but also\r\nother series. These were the first steps taken by Newton, and, as he\r\nhimself informs us, they would have entirely escaped from his memory\r\nif he had not, a few weeks before,[58] found the notes which he made\r\nupon the subject. When he had obtained this method, it occurred to him\r\nthat the very same process was applicable to the ordinates, and, by\r\nfollowing out this idea, he discovered the general method of reducing\r\nradical quantities composed of several terms into infinite series, and\r\nwas thus led to the discovery of the celebrated _Binomial Theorem_. He\r\nnow neglected entirely his methods of interpolation, and employed that\r\ntheorem alone as the easiest and most direct method for the quadratures\r\nof curves, and in the solution of many questions which had not even\r\nbeen attempted by the most skilful mathematicians.\r\n\r\nAfter having applied the Binomial theorem to the rectification of\r\ncurves, and to the determination of the surfaces and contents of\r\nsolids, and the position of their centres of gravity, he discovered the\r\ngeneral principle of deducing the areas of curves from the ordinate,\r\nby considering the area as a nascent quantity, increasing by continual\r\nfluxion in the proportion of the length of the ordinate, and supposing\r\nthe abscissa to increase uniformly in proportion to the time. In\r\nimitation of Cavalerius, he called the momentary increment of a line a\r\npoint, though it is not a geometrical point, but an infinitely short\r\nline; and the momentary increment of an area or surface he called a\r\nline, though it is not a geometrical line, but an infinitely narrow\r\nsurface. By thus regarding lines as generated by the motion of points,\r\nsurfaces by the motions of lines, and solids by the motion of surfaces,\r\nand by considering that the ordinates, abscissæ, &c. of curves thus\r\nformed, vary according to a regular law depending on the equation of\r\nthe curve, he deduces from this equation the velocities with which\r\nthese quantities are generated; and by the rules of infinite series he\r\nobtains the ultimate value of the quantity required. To the velocities\r\nwith which every line or quantity is generated, Newton gave the name\r\nof _Fluxions_, and to the lines or quantities themselves that of\r\n_Fluents_. This method constitutes the doctrine of fluxions which\r\nNewton had invented previous to 1666, when the breaking out of the\r\nplague at Cambridge drove him from that city, and turned his attention\r\nto other subjects.\r\n\r\nBut though Newton had not communicated this great invention to any\r\nof his friends, he composed his treatise, entitled _Analysis per\r\nequationes numero terminorum infinitas_, in which the principle of\r\nfluxions and its numerous applications are clearly pointed out. In\r\nthe month of June, 1669, he communicated this work to Dr. Barrow, who\r\nmentions it in a letter to Mr. Collins, dated the 20th June, 1669, as\r\nthe production of a friend of his residing at Cambridge, who possesses\r\na fine genius for such inquiries. On the 31st July, he transmitted the\r\nwork to Collins; and having received his approbation of it, he informs\r\nhim that the name of the author of it was Newton, a fellow of his\r\nown college, and a young man who had only two years before taken his\r\ndegree of M.A. Collins took a copy of this treatise, and returned the\r\noriginal to Dr. Barrow; and this copy having been found among Collins’s\r\npapers by his friend Mr. William Jones, and compared with the original\r\nmanuscript borrowed from Newton, it was published with the consent of\r\nNewton in 1711, nearly fifty years after it was written.\r\n\r\nThough the discoveries contained in this treatise were not at\r\nfirst given to the world, yet they were made generally known to\r\nmathematicians by the correspondence of Collins, who communicated them\r\nto James Gregory; to MM. Bertet and Vernon in France; to Slusius in\r\nHolland; to Borelli in Italy; and to Strode, Townsend, and Oldenburg,\r\nin letters dated between 1669 and 1672.\r\n\r\nHitherto the method of fluxions was known only to the friends of\r\nNewton and their correspondents; but, in the first edition of the\r\nPrincipia, which appeared in 1687, he published, for the first time,\r\nthe fundamental principle of the fluxionary calculus, in the second\r\nlemma of the second book. No information, however, is here given\r\nrespecting the algorithm or notation of the calculus; and it was not\r\ntill 1693–5[?] that it was communicated to the mathematical world in\r\nthe second volume of Dr. Wallis’s works, which were published in that\r\nyear. This information was extracted from two letters of Newton written\r\nin 1692.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1672, Newton had undertaken to publish an edition of\r\nKinckhuysen’s Algebra, with notes and additions. He therefore drew up\r\na treatise, entitled, _A Method of Fluxions_, which he proposed as an\r\nintroduction to that work; but the fear of being involved in disputes\r\nabout this new discovery, or perhaps the wish to render it more\r\ncomplete, or to have the sole advantage of employing it in his physical\r\nresearches, induced him to abandon this design. At a later period of\r\nhis life he again resolved to give it to the world; but it did not\r\nappear till after his death, when it was translated into English, and\r\npublished in 1736, with a commentary by Mr. John Colson, Professor of\r\nMathematics in Cambridge.[59]\r\n\r\nTo the first edition of Newton’s Optics, which appeared in 1704, there\r\nwere added two mathematical treatises, entitled, _Tractatus duo de\r\nspeciebus et magnitudine figurarum curvilinearum_, the one bearing the\r\ntitle of _Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum_, and the other _Enumeratio\r\nlinearum tertii ordinis_. The first contains an explanation of the\r\ndoctrine of fluxions, and of its application to the quadrature of\r\ncurves; and the second a classification of seventy-two curves of the\r\nthird order, with an account of their properties. The reason for\r\npublishing these two tracts in his Optics (in the subsequent editions\r\nof which they are omitted) is thus stated in the advertisement:—“In\r\na letter written to M. Leibnitz in the year 1679, and published by\r\nDr. Wallis, I mentioned a method by which I had found some general\r\ntheorems about squaring curvilinear figures on comparing them with the\r\nconic sections, or other the simplest figures with which they might be\r\ncompared. And some years ago I lent out a manuscript containing such\r\ntheorems; and having since met with some things copied out of it, I\r\nhave on this occasion made it public, prefixing to it an introduction,\r\nand joining a scholium concerning that method. And I have joined with\r\nit another small tract concerning the curvilineal figures of the second\r\nkind, which was also written many years ago, and made known to some\r\nfriends, who have solicited the making it public.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1707, Mr. Whiston published the algebraical lectures\r\nwhich Newton had, during nine years, delivered at Cambridge, under\r\nthe title of _Arithmetica Universalis, sive de Compositione et\r\nResolutione Arithmetica Liber_. We are not accurately informed how\r\nMr. Whiston obtained possession of this work; but it is stated by one\r\nof the editors of the English edition, that “Mr. Whiston thinking it\r\na pity that so noble and useful a work should be doomed to a college\r\nconfinement, obtained leave to make it public.” It was soon afterward\r\ntranslated into English by Mr. Ralphson; and a second edition of it,\r\nwith improvements by the author, was published at London in 1712,\r\nby Dr. Machin, secretary to the Royal Society. With the view of\r\nstimulating mathematicians to write annotations on this admirable work,\r\nthe celebrated S’Gravesande published a tract, entitled, _Specimen\r\nCommentarii in Arithmeticam Universalem_; and Maclaurin’s Algebra seems\r\nto have been drawn up in consequence of this appeal.\r\n\r\nAmong the mathematical works of Newton we must not omit to enumerate a\r\nsmall tract entitled, _Methodus Differentialis_, which was published\r\nwith his consent in 1711. It consists of six propositions, which\r\ncontain a method of drawing a parabolic curve through any given\r\nnumber of points, and which are useful for constructing tables by the\r\ninterpolation of series, and for solving problems depending on the\r\nquadrature of curves.\r\n\r\nAnother mathematical treatise of Newton’s was published for the\r\nfirst time in 1779, in Dr. Horsley’s edition of his works.[60] It is\r\nentitled, _Artis Analyticæ Specimina, vel Geometria Analytica_. In\r\nediting this work, which occupies about 130 quarto pages, Dr. Horsley\r\nused three manuscripts, one of which was in the handwriting of the\r\nauthor; another, written in an unknown hand, was given by Mr. William\r\nJones to the Honourable Charles Cavendish; and a third, copied from\r\nthis by Mr. James Wilson, the editor of Robins’s works, was given to\r\nDr. Horsley by Mr. John Nourse, bookseller to the king. Dr. Horsley\r\nhas divided it into twelve chapters, which treat of infinite series;\r\nof the reduction of affected equations; of the specious resolution\r\nof equations; of the doctrine of fluxions; of maxima and minima;\r\nof drawing tangents to curves; of the radius of curvature; of the\r\nquadrature of curves; of the area of curves which are comparable with\r\nthe conic sections; of the construction of mechanical problems, and on\r\nfinding the lengths of curves.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the mathematical works of our author, we must not\r\noverlook his solutions of the celebrated problems proposed by\r\nBernouilli and Leibnitz. On the Kalends of January, 1697, John\r\nBernouilli addressed a letter to the most distinguished mathematicians\r\nin Europe,[61] challenging them to solve the two following problems:\r\n\r\n1. To determine the curve line connecting two given points which are\r\nat different distances from the horizon, and not in the same vertical\r\nline, along which a body passing by its own gravity, and beginning\r\nto move at the upper point, shall descend to the lower point in the\r\nshortest time possible.\r\n\r\n2. To find a curve line of this property that the two segments of a\r\nright line drawn from a given point through the curve, being raised to\r\nany given power, and taken together, may make every where the same sum.\r\n\r\nOn the day after he received these problems, Newton addressed to Mr.\r\nCharles Montague, the President of the Royal Society, a solution of\r\nthem both. He announced that the curve required in the first problem\r\nmust be a cycloid, and he gave a method of determining it. He solved\r\nalso the second problem, and he showed that by the same method other\r\ncurves might be found which shall cut off three or more segments having\r\nthe like properties. Leibnitz, who was struck with the beauty of the\r\nproblem, requested Bernouilli, who had allowed six months for its\r\nsolution, to extend the period to twelve months. This delay was readily\r\ngranted, solutions were obtained from Newton, Leibnitz, and the Marquis\r\nde L’Hopital; and although that of Newton was anonymous, yet Bernouilli\r\nrecognised in it his powerful mind, “_tanquam_,” says he, “_ex ungue\r\nleonem_,” as the lion is known by his claw.\r\n\r\nThe last mathematical effort of our author was made with his usual\r\nsuccess, in solving a problem which Leibnitz proposed in 1716, in a\r\nletter to the Abbé Conti, “for the purpose, as he expressed it, of\r\nfeeling the pulse of the English analysts.” The object of this problem\r\nwas to determine the curve which should cut at right angles an infinity\r\nof curves of a given nature, but expressible by the same equation.\r\nNewton received this problem about five o’clock in the afternoon, as\r\nhe was returning from the Mint; and though the problem was extremely\r\ndifficult, and he himself much fatigued with business, yet he finished\r\nthe solution of it before he went to bed.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of the mathematical writings of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, not one of which were voluntarily communicated to the world by\r\nhimself. The publication of his Universal Arithmetic is said to have\r\nbeen a breach of confidence on the part of Whiston; and, however this\r\nmay be, it was an unfinished work, never designed for the public. The\r\npublication of his Quadrature of Curves, and of his Enumeration of\r\nCurve Lines, was rendered necessary, in consequence of plagiarisms from\r\nthe manuscripts of them which he had lent to his friends, and the rest\r\nof his analytical writings did not appear till after his death. It is\r\nnot easy to penetrate into the motives by which this great man was on\r\nthese occasions actuated. If his object was to keep possession of his\r\ndiscoveries till he had brought them to a higher degree of perfection,\r\nwe may approve of the propriety, though we cannot admire the prudence\r\nof such a step. If he wished to retain to himself his own methods, in\r\norder that he alone might have the advantage of them in prosecuting\r\nhis physical inquiries, we cannot reconcile so selfish a measure with\r\nthat openness and generosity of character which marked the whole of his\r\nlife. If he withheld his labours from the world in order to avoid the\r\ndisputes and contentions to which they might give rise, he adopted\r\nthe very worst method of securing his tranquillity. That this was the\r\nleading motive under which he acted, there is little reason to doubt.\r\nThe early delay in the publication of his method of fluxions, after the\r\nbreaking out of the plague at Cambridge, was probably owing to his not\r\nhaving completed the algorithm of that calculus; but no apology can be\r\nmade for the imprudence of withholding it any longer from the public.\r\nHad he published this noble discovery even previous to 1673, when his\r\ngreat rival had not even entered upon those studies which led him to\r\nthe same method, he would have secured to himself the undivided honour\r\nof the invention, and Leibnitz could have aspired to no other fame but\r\nthat of an improver of the doctrine of fluxions. But he unfortunately\r\nacted otherwise. He announced to his friends that he possessed a method\r\nof great generality and power; he communicated to them a general\r\naccount of its principles and applications; and the information which\r\nwas thus conveyed directed the attention of mathematicians to subjects\r\nto which they might not have otherwise applied their powers. In this\r\nway the discoveries which he had previously made were made subsequently\r\nby others; and Leibnitz, in place of appearing in the theatre of\r\nscience as the disciple and the follower of Newton, stood forth with\r\nall the dignity of a rival; and, by the early publication of his\r\ndiscoveries had nearly placed himself on the throne which Newton was\r\ndestined to ascend.\r\n\r\nIt would be inconsistent with the popular nature of a work like this,\r\nto enter into a detailed history of the dispute between Newton and\r\nLeibnitz respecting the invention of fluxions. A brief and general\r\naccount of it, however, is indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1673, Leibnitz came to London in the suite of\r\nthe Duke of Hanover, and he became acquainted with the great men who\r\nthen adorned the capital of England. Among these was Oldenburg, a\r\ncountryman of his own, who was then secretary to the Royal Society.\r\nAbout the beginning of March, in the same year, Leibnitz went to\r\nParis, where, with the assistance of Huygens, he devoted himself to\r\nthe study of the higher geometry. In the month of July he renewed his\r\ncorrespondence with Oldenburg, and he communicated to him some of\r\nthe discoveries which he had made relative to series, particularly\r\nthe series for a circular arc in terms of the tangent. Oldenburg\r\ninformed him in return of the discoveries on series which had been\r\nmade by Newton and Gregory; and in 1676 Newton communicated to him,\r\nthrough Oldenburg, a letter of fifteen closely printed quarto pages,\r\ncontaining many of his analytical discoveries, and stating that he\r\npossessed a general method of drawing tangents, which he thought it\r\nnecessary to conceal in two sentences of transposed characters. In this\r\nletter neither the method of fluxions nor any of its principles are\r\ncommunicated; but the superiority of the method over all others is so\r\nfully described, that Leibnitz could scarcely fail to discover that\r\nNewton possessed that secret of which geometers had so long been in\r\nquest.\r\n\r\nHad Leibnitz at the time of receiving this letter been entirely\r\nignorant of his own differential method, the information thus conveyed\r\nto him by Newton could not fail to stimulate his curiosity, and excite\r\nhis mightiest efforts to obtain possession of so great a secret. That\r\nthis new method was intimately connected with the subject of series\r\nwas clearly indicated by Newton; and as Leibnitz was deeply versed in\r\nthis branch of analysis, it is far from improbable that a mind of such\r\nstrength and acuteness might attain his object by direct investigation.\r\nThat this was the case may be inferred from his letter to Oldenburg (to\r\nbe communicated to Newton) of the 21st June, 1677, where he mentions\r\nthat he had for some time been in possession of a method of drawing\r\ntangents more general than that of Slusius, namely, by the differences\r\nof ordinates. He then proceeds with the utmost frankness to explain\r\nthis method, which was no other than the differential calculus.\r\nHe describes the algorithm which he had adopted, the formation of\r\ndifferential equations, and the application of the calculus to various\r\ngeometrical and analytical questions. No answer seems to have been\r\nreturned to this letter either by Newton or Oldenburg, and, with the\r\nexception of a short letter from Leibnitz to Oldenburg, dated 12th\r\nJuly, 1677, no further correspondence seems to have taken place. This,\r\nno doubt, arose from the death of Oldenburg in the month of August,\r\n1677,[62] when the two rival geometers pursued their researches\r\nwith all the ardour which the greatness of the subject was so well\r\ncalculated to inspire.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of Leibnitz the differential calculus made rapid progress.\r\nIn the _Acta Eruditorum_, which was published at Leipsic in November,\r\n1684, he gave the first account of it, describing its algorithm in the\r\nsame manner as he had done in his letter to Oldenburg, and pointing\r\nout its application to the drawing of tangents, and the determination\r\nof maxima and minima. He makes a remote reference to the _similar_\r\ncalculus of Newton, but lays no claim to the sole invention of the\r\ndifferential method. In the same work for June, 1686, he resumes\r\nthe subject; and when Newton had not published a single word upon\r\nfluxions, and had not even made known his notation, the differential\r\ncalculus was making rapid advances on the Continent, and in the hands\r\nof James and John Bernouilli had proved the means of solving some of\r\nthe most important and difficult problems.\r\n\r\nThe silence of Newton was at last broken, and in the second lemma\r\nof the second book of the Principia, he explained the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the fluxionary calculus. His explanation, which occupied\r\nonly three pages, was terminated with the following scholium:—“In a\r\ncorrespondence which took place about ten years ago between that very\r\nskilful geometer, G. G. Leibnitz, and myself, I announced to him that\r\nI possessed a method of determining maxima and minima, of drawing\r\ntangents, and of performing similar operations which was equally\r\napplicable to rational and irrational quantities, and concealed the\r\nsame in transposed letters involving this sentence, (_data equatione\r\nquotcunque fluentes quantitates involvente, fluxiones invenire et\r\nvice versa_). This illustrious man replied that he also had fallen\r\non a method of the same kind, and he communicated to me his method\r\nwhich scarcely differed from mine except in the notation [and in the\r\nidea of the generation of quantities.”][63] This celebrated scholium,\r\nwhich is so often referred to in the present controversy, has, in\r\nour opinion, been much misapprehended. While M. Biot considers it\r\nas “eternalizing the rights of Leibnitz by recognising them in the\r\nPrincipia,” Professor Playfair regards it as containing “a highly\r\nfavourable opinion on the subject of the discoveries of Leibnitz.”\r\nTo us it appears to be nothing more than the simple statement of the\r\nfact, that the method communicated by Leibnitz was nearly the same as\r\nhis own; and this much he might have said, whether he believed that\r\nLeibnitz had seen the fluxionary calculus among the papers of Collins,\r\nor was the independent inventor of his own. It is more than probable,\r\nindeed, that when Newton wrote this scholium he regarded Leibnitz as a\r\nsecond inventor; but when he found that Leibnitz and his friends had\r\nshowed a willingness to believe, and had even ventured to throw out the\r\nsuspicion, that he himself had borrowed the doctrine of fluxions from\r\nthe differential calculus, he seems to have altered the opinion which\r\nhe had formed of his rival, and to have been willing in his turn to\r\nretort the charge.\r\n\r\nThis change of opinion was brought about by a series of circumstances\r\nover which he had no control. M. Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a Swiss\r\nmathematician, resident in London, communicated to the Royal Society,\r\nin 1699, a paper on the line of quickest descent, which contains\r\nthe following observations:—“Compelled by the evidence of facts, I\r\nhold Newton to have been the first inventor of this calculus, and\r\nthe earliest by several years; and whether Leibnitz, the _second\r\ninventor_, has borrowed any thing from the other, I would prefer to my\r\nown judgment that of those who have seen the letters and other copies\r\nof the same manuscripts of Newton.” This imprudent remark, which by\r\nno means amounts to a charge of plagiarism, for Leibnitz is actually\r\ndesignated the _second inventor_, may be considered as showing that\r\nthe English mathematicians had been cherishing suspicions unfavourable\r\nto Leibnitz, and there can be no doubt that a feeling had long\r\nprevailed that this mathematician either had, or might have seen, among\r\nthe papers of Collins, the “_Analysis per Equationes, &c._,” which\r\ncontained the principles of the fluxionary method. Leibnitz replied\r\nto the remark of Duillier with much good feeling. He appealed to the\r\nfacts as exhibited in his correspondence with Oldenburg; he referred to\r\nNewton’s scholium as a testimony in his favour; and, without disputing\r\nor acknowledging the priority of Newton’s claim, he asserted his own\r\nright to the invention of the differential calculus. Fatio transmitted\r\na reply to the Leipsic Acts; but the editor refused to insert it. The\r\ndispute, therefore, terminated, and the feelings of the contending\r\nparties continued for some time in a state of repose, though ready to\r\nbreak out on the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\nWhen Newton’s Optics appeared in 1704, accompanied by his Treatise on\r\nthe Quadrature of Curves, and his enumeration of lines of the third\r\norder, the editor of the Leipsic Acts (whom Newton supposed to be\r\nLeibnitz himself) took occasion to review the first of these tracts.\r\nAfter giving an imperfect analysis of its contents, he compared the\r\nmethod of fluxions with the differential calculus, and, in a sentence\r\nof some ambiguity, he states that Newton employed fluxions in place\r\nof the differences of Leibnitz, and made use of them in his Principia\r\nin the same manner as Honoratus Fabri, in his Synopsis of Geometry,\r\nhad substituted progressive motion in place of the indivisibles of\r\nCavaleri.[64] As Fabri, therefore, was not the inventor of the method\r\nwhich is here referred to, but borrowed it from Cavaleri, and only\r\nchanged the mode of its expression, there can be no doubt that the\r\nartful insinuation contained in the above passage was intended to\r\nconvey the impression that Newton had _stolen_ his method of fluxions\r\nfrom Leibnitz. The indirect character of this attack, in place\r\nof mitigating its severity, renders it doubly odious; and we are\r\npersuaded that no candid reader can peruse the passage without a strong\r\nconviction that it justifies, in the fullest manner, the indignant\r\nfeelings which it excited among the English philosophers. If Leibnitz\r\nwas the author of the review, or if he was in any way a party to it, he\r\nmerited the full measure of rebuke which was dealt out to him by the\r\nfriends of Newton, and deserved those severe reprisals which doubtless\r\nimbittered the rest of his days. He who dared to accuse a man like\r\nNewton, or indeed any man holding a fair character in society, with\r\nthe odious crime of plagiarism, placed himself without the pale of\r\nthe ordinary courtesies of life, and deserved to have the same charge\r\nthrown back upon himself. The man who conceives his fellow to be\r\ncapable of such intellectual felony, avows the possibility of himself\r\ncommitting it, and almost substantiates the weakest evidence of the\r\nworst accusers.\r\n\r\nDr. Keill, as the representative of Newton’s friends, could not brook\r\nthis base attack upon his countryman. In a letter printed in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1708, he maintained that Newton was\r\n“beyond all doubt” the first inventor of fluxions. He referred for\r\na direct proof of this to his letters published by Wallis; and he\r\nasserted “that the same calculus was afterward published by Leibnitz,\r\nthe name and the mode of notation being changed.” If the reader is\r\ndisposed to consider this passage as retorting the charge of plagiarism\r\nupon Leibnitz, he will readily admit that the mode of its expression\r\nis neither so coarse nor so insidious as that which is used by the\r\nwriter in the Leipsic Acts. In a letter to Hans Sloane, dated March,\r\n1711, Leibnitz complained to the Royal Society of the treatment he had\r\nreceived. He expressed his conviction that Keill had erred more from\r\nrashness of judgment than from any improper motive, and that he did not\r\nregard the accusation as a calumny; and he requested that the society\r\nwould oblige Mr. Keill to disown publicly the injurious sense which\r\nhis words might bear. When this letter was read to the society, Keill\r\njustified himself to Sir Isaac Newton and the other members by showing\r\nthem the obnoxious review of the Quadrature of Curves in the Leipsic\r\nActs. They all agreed in attaching the same injurious meaning to the\r\npassage which we formerly quoted, and authorized Keill to explain and\r\ndefend his statement. He accordingly addressed a letter to Sir Hans\r\nSloane, which was read at the society on the 24th May, 1711, and a copy\r\nof which was ordered to be sent to Leibnitz. In this letter, which is\r\none of considerable length, he declares that he never meant to state\r\nthat Leibnitz knew either the name of Newton’s method or the form of\r\nnotation, and that the real meaning of the passage was, “that Newton\r\nwas the first inventor of fluxions or of the differential calculus,\r\nand that he had given, in two letters to Oldenburg, and which he had\r\ntransmitted to Leibnitz, indications of it sufficiently intelligible to\r\nan acute mind, from which Leibnitz derived, or at least might derive,\r\nthe principles of his calculus.”\r\n\r\nThe charge of plagiarism which Leibnitz thought was implied in the\r\nformer letter of his antagonist is here greatly modified, if not\r\naltogether denied. Keill expresses only an _opinion_ that the letter\r\n_seen_ by Leibnitz contained intelligible indications of the fluxionary\r\ncalculus. Even if this opinion were correct, it is no proof that\r\nLeibnitz either saw these indications or availed himself of them, or if\r\nhe did perceive them, it might have been in consequence of his having\r\npreviously been in possession of the differential calculus, or having\r\nenjoyed some distant view of it. Leibnitz should, therefore, have\r\nallowed the dispute to terminate here; for no ingenuity on his part,\r\nand no additional facts, could affect an opinion which any other person\r\nas well as Keill was entitled to maintain.\r\n\r\nLeibnitz, however, took a different view of the subject, and wrote a\r\nletter to Sir Hans Sloane, dated December 19, 1711, which excited new\r\nfeelings, and involved him in new embarrassments. Insensible to the\r\nmitigation which had been kindly impressed upon the supposed charge\r\nagainst his honour, he alleges that Keill had attacked his candour and\r\nsincerity more openly than before;—that he acted without any authority\r\nfrom Sir Isaac Newton, who was the party interested;—and that it was\r\nin vain to justify his proceedings by referring to the provocation\r\nin the Leipsic Acts, because in that journal _no injustice had been\r\ndone to any party, but every one had received what was his due_. He\r\nbranded Keill with the odious appellation of an upstart, and one little\r\nacquainted with the circumstances of the case;[65] he called upon\r\nthe society to silence his vain and unjust clamours,[66] which, he\r\nbelieved, were disapproved by Newton himself, who was well acquainted\r\nwith the facts, and who, he was persuaded, would willingly give his\r\nopinion on the matter.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate letter was doubtless the cause of all the rancour and\r\ncontroversy which so speedily followed, and it placed his antagonist\r\nin a new and a more favourable position. It may be correct, though\r\nfew will admit it, that Keill’s second letter was more injurious than\r\nthe first; but it was not true that Keill acted without the authority\r\nof Newton, because Keill’s letter was approved of and transmitted by\r\nthe Royal Society, of which Newton was the president, and therefore\r\nbecame the act of that body. The obnoxious part, however, of Leibnitz’s\r\nletter consisted in his appropriating to himself the opinions of the\r\nreviewer in the Leipsic Acts, by declaring that, in a review which\r\ncharged Newton with plagiarism, every person had got what was his due.\r\nThe whole character of the controversy was now changed: Leibnitz places\r\nhimself in the position of the party who had first disturbed the\r\ntranquillity of science by maligning its most distinguished ornament;\r\nand the Royal Society was imperiously called upon to throw all the\r\nlight they could upon a transaction which had exposed their venerable\r\npresident to so false a charge. The society, too, had become a party to\r\nthe question, by their approbation and transmission of Keill’s second\r\nletter, and were on that account alone bound to vindicate the step\r\nwhich they had taken.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter of Leibnitz, therefore, was read, Keill appealed to the\r\nregisters of the society for the proofs of what he had advanced; Sir\r\nIsaac also expressed his displeasure at the obnoxious passage in the\r\nLeipsic Review, and at the defence of it by Leibnitz, and he left it to\r\nthe society to act as they thought proper. A committee was therefore\r\nappointed on the 11th March, consisting of Dr. Arbuthnot, Mr. Hill,\r\nDr. Halley, Mr. Jones, Mr. Machin, and Mr. Burnet, who were instructed\r\nto examine the ancient registers of the society, to inquire into the\r\ndispute, and to produce such documents as they should find, together\r\nwith their own opinions on the subject. On the 24th April the committee\r\nproduced the following report:—\r\n\r\n“We have consulted the letters and letter-books in the custody of the\r\nRoyal Society, and those found among the papers of Mr. John Collins,\r\ndated between the years 1669 and 1677, inclusive; and showed them to\r\nsuch as knew and avouched the hands of Mr. Barrow, Mr. Collins, Mr.\r\nOldenburg, and Mr. Leibnitz; and compared those of Mr. Gregory with\r\none another, and with copies of some of them taken in the hand of\r\nMr. Collins; and have extracted from them what relates to the matter\r\nreferred to us; all which extracts herewith delivered to you we believe\r\nto be genuine and authentic. And by these letters and papers we find,—\r\n\r\n“I. Mr. Leibnitz was in London in the beginning of the year 1673;\r\nand went thence, in or about March, to Paris, where he kept a\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Collins by means of Mr. Oldenburg, till\r\nabout September, 1676, and then returned by London and Amsterdam to\r\nHanover: and that Mr. Collins was very free in communicating to able\r\nmathematicians what he had received from Mr. Newton and Mr. Gregory.\r\n\r\n“II. That when Mr. Leibnitz was the first time in London, he contended\r\nfor the invention of another differential method properly so called;\r\nand, notwithstanding that he was shown by Dr. Pell that it was Newton’s\r\nmethod, persisted in maintaining it to be his own invention, by reason\r\nthat he had found it by himself without knowing what Newton had done\r\nbefore, and had much improved it. And we find no mention of his having\r\nany other differential method than Newton’s before his letter of the\r\n21st of June, 1677, which was a year after a copy of Mr. Newton’s\r\nletter of the 10th of December, 1672, had been sent to Paris to be\r\ncommunicated to him; and above four years after, Mr. Collins began\r\nto communicate that letter to his correspondent; in which letter the\r\nmethod of fluxions was sufficiently described to any intelligent person.\r\n\r\n“III. That by Mr. Newton’s letter of the 13th of June, 1676, it appears\r\nthat he had the method of fluxions above five years before the writing\r\nof that letter. And by his Analysis per Æquationes numero Terminorum\r\nInfinitas, communicated by Dr. Barrow to Mr. Collins in July, 1669, we\r\nfind that he had invented the method before that time.\r\n\r\n“IV. That the differential method is one and the same with the method\r\nof fluxions, excepting the name and mode of notation; Mr. Leibnitz\r\ncalling those quantities differences which Mr. Newton calls moments or\r\nfluxions; and marking them with the letter _d_—a mark not used by Mr.\r\nNewton.\r\n\r\n“And therefore we take the proper question to be not who invented this\r\nor that method, but who was the first inventor of the method. And we\r\nbelieve that those who have reputed Mr. Leibnitz the first inventor\r\nknew little or nothing of his correspondence with Mr. Collins and Mr.\r\nOldenburg long before, nor of Mr. Newton’s having that method above\r\nfifteen years before Mr. Leibnitz began to publish it in the Acta\r\nEruditorum of Leipsic.\r\n\r\n“For which reason we reckon Mr. Newton the first inventor; and are\r\nof opinion that Mr. Keill, in asserting the same, has been no ways\r\ninjurious to Mr. Leibnitz. And we submit to the judgment of the society\r\nwhether the extract and papers now presented to you, together with what\r\nis extant to the same purpose in Dr. Wallis’s third volume, may not\r\ndeserve to be made public.”\r\n\r\nThis report being read, the society unanimously ordered the collection\r\nof letters and manuscripts to be printed, and appointed Dr. Halley,\r\nMr. Jones, and Mr. Machin to superintend the press. Complete copies of\r\nit, under the title of _Commercium Epistolicum D. Johannis Collins et\r\naliorum de analysi promota_, were laid before the society on the 8th\r\nJanuary, 1713, and Sir Isaac Newton, as president, ordered a copy to be\r\ndelivered to each person of the committee appointed for that purpose,\r\nto examine it before its publication.\r\n\r\nLeibnitz received information of the appearance of the Commercium\r\nEpistolicum when he was at Vienna; and “being satisfied,” as he\r\nexpresses it, “that it must contain _malicious falsehoods_, I did not\r\nthink proper to send for it by post, but wrote to M. Bernouilli to give\r\nme his sentiments. M. Bernouilli wrote me a letter dated at Basle,\r\nJune 7th, 1713, in which he said _that it appeared probable that Sir\r\nIsaac Newton had formed his calculus after having seen mine_.”[67] This\r\nletter was published by a friend of Leibnitz, with reflections, in a\r\nloose sheet entitled _Charta Volans_, and dated July 29, 1713. It was\r\nwidely circulated without either the name of the author, printer, or\r\nplace of publication, and was communicated to the _Journal Literaire_\r\nby another friend of Leibnitz, who added remarks of his own, and\r\nstated, that when Newton published the Principia in 1687, _he did not\r\nunderstand the true differential method; and that he took his fluxions\r\nfrom Leibnitz_.\r\n\r\nIn this state of the controversy, Mr. Chamberlayne conceived the design\r\nof reconciling the two distinguished philosophers; and in a letter\r\ndated April 28, 1714,[68] he addressed himself to Leibnitz, who was\r\nstill at Vienna. In replying to this letter, Leibnitz declared that he\r\nhad given no occasion for the dispute; “that Newton procured a book to\r\nbe published, which was written purposely to discredit him, and sent\r\nit to Germany, &c. as in the name of the society;” and he stated _that\r\nthere was room to doubt whether Newton knew his invention before he\r\nhad it of him_. Mr. Chamberlayne communicated this letter to Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, who replied that Leibnitz had attacked his reputation in 1705,\r\nby intimating that he had borrowed from him the method of fluxions;\r\nthat if Mr. C. could point out to him any thing in which he had injured\r\nMr. Leibnitz, he would give him satisfaction; that he would not retract\r\nthings which he knew to be true; and that he believed that the Royal\r\nSociety had done no injustice by the publication of the Commercium\r\nEpistolicum.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society, having learned that Leibnitz complained of their\r\nhaving condemned him unheard, inserted a declaration in their journals\r\non the 20th May, 1714, that they did not pretend that the report\r\nof their committee should pass for a decision of the society. Mr.\r\nChamberlayne sent a copy of this to Leibnitz, along with Sir Isaac’s\r\nletter, and Dr. Keill’s answer to the papers inserted in the Journal\r\nLiteraire. After perusing these documents, M. Leibnitz replied, “that\r\nSir Isaac’s letter was written with very little civility; that he was\r\nnot in a humour to put himself in a passion against such people; that\r\nthere were other letters among those of Oldenburg and Collins which\r\nshould have been published; and that on his return to Hanover, he would\r\nbe able to publish a Commercium Epistolicum which would be of service\r\nto the history of learning.” When this letter was read to the Royal\r\nSociety, Sir Isaac remarked, that the last part of it injuriously\r\naccused the society of having made a partial selection of papers for\r\nthe Commercium Epistolicum; that he did not interfere in any way in\r\nthe publication of that work, and had even withheld from the committee\r\ntwo letters, one from Leibnitz in 1693, and another from Wallis in\r\n1695, which were highly favourable to his cause. He stated that he\r\ndid not think it right for M. Leibnitz himself, but that, if he had\r\nletters to produce in his favour, that they might be published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, or in Germany.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Abbé Conti, a noble Venetian, came to England. He\r\nwas a correspondent of Leibnitz, and in a letter which he had received\r\nsoon after his arrival,[69] he enters upon his dispute with Newton.\r\nHe charges the English “with wishing to pass for almost the only\r\ninventors.” He declares “that Bernouilli had judged rightly in saying\r\nthat Newton did not possess before him the infinitesimal characteristic\r\nand algorithm.” He remarks that Newton preceded him only in series; and\r\nhe confesses that during his second visit to England, “Collins showed\r\nhim part of his correspondence,” or, as he afterward expresses it, he\r\nsaw “some of the letters of Newton at Mr. Collins’s.” He then attacks\r\nSir Isaac’s philosophy, particularly his opinions about gravity and\r\nvacuum, the intervention of God for the preservation of his creatures;\r\nand he accuses him of reviving the occult qualities of the schools. But\r\nthe most remarkable passage in this letter is the following: “I am a\r\ngreat friend of experimental philosophy, but Newton deviates much from\r\nit _when he pretends that all matter is heavy_, or that each particle\r\nof matter attracts every other particle.”\r\n\r\nThe above letter to the Abbé Conti was generally shown in London,\r\nand came to be much talked of at court, in consequence of Leibnitz\r\nhaving been privy counsellor to the Elector of Hanover when that\r\nprince ascended the throne of England. Many persons of distinction,\r\nand particularly the Abbé Conti, urged Newton to reply to Leibnitz’s\r\nletter, but he resisted all their solicitations. One day, however, King\r\nGeorge I. inquired when Sir Isaac Newton’s answer to Leibnitz would\r\nappear; and when Sir Isaac heard this, he addressed a long reply to the\r\nAbbé Conti, dated February 26th, O. S. 1715–16. This letter, written\r\nwith dignified severity, is a triumphant refutation of the allegations\r\nof his adversary; and the following passage deserves to be quoted, as\r\nconnected with that branch of the dispute which relates to Leibnitz’s\r\nhaving seen part of Newton’s letters to Mr. Collins. “He complains of\r\nthe committee of the Royal Society, as if they had acted partially in\r\nomitting what made against me; but he fails in proving the accusation.\r\nFor he instances in a paragraph concerning my ignorance, pretending\r\nthat they omitted it, and yet you will find it in the Commercium\r\nEpistolicum, p. 547, lines 2, 3, and I am not ashamed of it. He saith\r\nthat he saw this paragraph in the hands of Mr. Collins when he was in\r\nLondon the second time, that is in October, 1676. It is in my letter\r\nof the 24th of October, 1676, and therefore he then saw that letter.\r\nAnd in that and some other letters writ before that time, I described\r\nmy method of fluxions; and in the same letter I described also two\r\ngeneral methods of series, one of which is now claimed from me by Mr.\r\nLeibnitz.” The letter concludes with the following paragraph: “But as\r\nhe has lately attacked me with an accusation which amounts to plagiary;\r\nif he goes on to accuse me, it lies upon him by the laws of all\r\nnations to prove his accusations, on pain of being accounted guilty of\r\ncalumny. He hath hitherto written letters to his correspondents full of\r\naffirmations, complaints, and reflections, without proving any thing.\r\nBut he is the aggressor, and it lies upon him to prove the charge.”\r\n\r\nIn transmitting this letter to Leibnitz, the Abbé Conti informed him\r\nthat he himself had read with great attention, and without the least\r\nprejudice, the Commercium Epistolicum, and the little piece[70] that\r\ncontains the extract; that he had also seen at the Royal Society the\r\noriginal papers of the Commercium Epistolicum, and some other original\r\npieces relating to it. “From all this,” says he, “I infer, that, if\r\nall the digressions are cut off, the only point is, whether Sir Isaac\r\nNewton had the method of fluxions or infinitesimals before you, or\r\nwhether you had it before him. You published it first, it is true, but\r\nyou have owned also that Sir Isaac Newton had given many hints of it in\r\nhis letters to Mr. Oldenburg and others. This is proved very largely in\r\nthe Commercium, and in the extract of it. What answer do you give? This\r\nis still wanting to the public, in order to form an exact judgment of\r\nthe affair.” The Abbé adds, that Mr. Leibnitz’s own friends waited for\r\nhis answer with great impatience, and that they thought he could not\r\ndispense with answering, if not Dr. Keill, at least Sir Isaac Newton\r\nhimself, who had given him a defiance in express terms.\r\n\r\nLeibnitz was not long in complying with this request. He addressed a\r\nletter to the Abbé Conti, dated April 9th, 1716, but he sent it through\r\nM. Ramond at Paris, to communicate it to others. When it was received\r\nby the Abbé Conti, Newton wrote observations upon it, which were\r\ncommunicated only to some of his friends, and which, while they placed\r\nhis defence on the most impregnable basis, at the same time threw much\r\nlight on the early history of his mathematical discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe death of Leibnitz on the 14th November, 1716, put an end to\r\nthis controversy, and Newton some time afterward published the\r\ncorrespondence with the Abbé Conti, which had hitherto been only\r\nprivately circulated among the friends of the disputants.[71]\r\n\r\nIn 1722, a new edition of the Commercium Epistolicum was published,\r\nand there was prefixed to it a general review of its contents, which\r\nhas been falsely ascribed to Newton.[72] When the third edition of\r\nthe Principia was published in 1725, the celebrated scholium which we\r\nhave already quoted, and in which Leibnitz’s differential calculus was\r\nmentioned, was struck out either by Newton or by the editor. This step\r\nwas perhaps rash and ill-advised; but as the scholium had been adduced\r\nby Leibnitz and others as a proof that Newton acknowledged him to be\r\nan independent inventor of the calculus,—an interpretation which it\r\ndoes not bear, and which Newton expressly states he never intended it\r\nto bear,—he was justified in withdrawing a passage which had been so\r\nerroneously interpreted, and so greatly misapplied.\r\n\r\nIn viewing this controversy, at the distance of more than a century,\r\nwhen the passions of the individual combatants have been allayed,\r\nand national jealousies extinguished, it is not difficult to form a\r\ncorrect estimate of the conduct and claims of the two rival analysts.\r\nBy the unanimous verdict of all nations, it has been decided that\r\nNewton invented fluxions at least ten years before Leibnitz. Some of\r\nthe letters of Newton which bore reference to this great discovery\r\nwere perused by the German mathematician; but there is no evidence\r\nwhatever that he borrowed his differential calculus from these letters.\r\nNewton was therefore the _first_ inventor, and Leibnitz the _second_.\r\nIt was impossible that the former could have been a plagiarist; but it\r\nwas possible for the latter. Had the letters of Newton contained even\r\nstronger indications than they do of the new calculus, no evidence\r\nshort of proof could have justified any allegation against Leibnitz’s\r\nhonour. The talents which he displayed in the improvement of the\r\ncalculus showed that he was capable of inventing it; and his character\r\nstood sufficiently high to repel every suspicion of his integrity. But\r\nif it would have been criminal to charge Leibnitz with plagiarism, what\r\nmust we think of those who dared to accuse Newton of borrowing his\r\nfluxions from Leibnitz? This odious accusation was made by Leibnitz\r\nhimself, and by Bernouilli; and we have seen that the former repeated\r\nit again and again, as if his own good name rested on the destruction\r\nof that of his rival. It was this charge against Newton that gave\r\nrise to the attack of Keill, and the publication of the Commercium\r\nEpistolicum; and, notwithstanding this high provocation, the committee\r\nof the Royal Society contented themselves with asserting Newton’s\r\npriority, without retorting the charge of plagiarism upon his rival.\r\n\r\nAlthough an attempt has been recently made to place the conduct of\r\nLeibnitz on the same level with that of Newton, yet the circumstances\r\nof the case will by no means justify such a comparison. The conduct\r\nof Newton was at all times dignified and just. He knew his rights,\r\nand he boldly claimed them. Conscious of his integrity, he spurned\r\nwith indignation the charge of plagiarism with which an ungenerous\r\nrival had so insidiously loaded him; and if there was one step in his\r\nfrank and unhesitating procedure which posterity can blame it is his\r\nomission, in the third edition of the Principia, of the references\r\nto the differential calculus of Leibnitz. This omission, however,\r\nwas perfectly just. The scholium which he had left out was a mere\r\nhistorical statement of the fact, that the German mathematician had\r\nsent him a method which was the same as his own; and when he found\r\nthat this simple assertion had been held by Leibnitz and others as a\r\nrecognition of his independent claim to the invention, he was bound\r\neither to omit it altogether, or to enter into explanations which might\r\nhave involved him in a new controversy.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Leibnitz was not marked with the same noble lineaments.\r\nThat he was the aggressor is universally allowed. That he first dared\r\nto breathe the charge of plagiarism against Newton, and that he often\r\nreferred to it, has been sufficiently apparent; and when arguments\r\nfailed him he had recourse to threats—declaring that he would publish\r\nanother Commercium Epistolicum, though he had no appropriate letters\r\nto produce. All this is now matter of history; and we may find some\r\napology for it in his excited feelings, and in the insinuations which\r\nwere occasionally thrown out against the originality of his discovery;\r\nbut for other parts of his conduct we seek in vain for an excuse.\r\nWhen he assailed the philosophy of Newton in his letters to the Abbé\r\nConti, he exhibited perhaps only the petty feelings of a rival; but\r\nwhen he dared to calumniate that great man in his correspondence with\r\nthe Princess of Wales, by whom he was respected and beloved; when he\r\nventured to represent the Newtonian philosophy as physically false,\r\nand as dangerous to religion; and when he founded these accusations on\r\npassages in the Principia and the Optics glowing with all the fervour\r\nof genuine piety, he cast a blot upon his name, which all his talents\r\nas a philosopher, and all his virtues as a man, will never be able to\r\nefface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  _James II. attacks the Privileges of the University of Cambridge—\r\n    Newton chosen one of the Delegates to resist this Encroachment—He\r\n    is elected a Member of the Convention Parliament—Burning of his\r\n    Manuscripts—His supposed Derangement of Mind—View taken of this by\r\n    foreign Philosophers—His Correspondence with Mr. Pepys and Mr. Locke\r\n    at the time of his Illness—Mr. Millington’s Letter to Mr. Pepys on\r\n    the subject of Newton’s Illness—Refutation of the Statement that he\r\n    laboured under Mental Derangement._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1669, when Newton was installed in the Lucasian chair,\r\ntill 1695, when he ceased to reside in Cambridge, he seems to have been\r\nseldom absent from his college more than three or four weeks in the\r\nyear. In 1675, he received a dispensation from Charles II. to continue\r\nin his fellowship of Trinity College without taking orders, and we have\r\nalready seen in the preceding chapter how his time was occupied till\r\nthe publication of the Principia in 1687.\r\n\r\nAn event now occurred which drew Newton from the seclusion of his\r\nstudies, and placed him upon the theatre of public life. Desirous of\r\nre-establishing the Catholic faith in its former supremacy, King James\r\nII. had begun to assail the rights and privileges of his Protestant\r\nsubjects. Among other illegal acts, he sent his letter of mandamus\r\nto the University of Cambridge to order Father Francis, an ignorant\r\nmonk of the Benedictine order, to be received as master of arts, and\r\nto enjoy all the privileges of this degree, without taking the oaths\r\nof allegiance and supremacy. The university speedily perceived the\r\nconsequences which might arise from such a measure. Independent of\r\nthe infringement of their rights which such an order involved, it was\r\nobvious that the highest interests of the university were endangered,\r\nand that Roman Catholics might soon become a majority in the\r\nconvocation. They therefore unanimously refused to listen to the royal\r\norder, and they did this with a firmness of purpose which irritated\r\nthe despotic court. The king reiterated his commands, and accompanied\r\nthem with the severest threatenings in case of disobedience. The\r\nCatholics were not idle in supporting the views of the sovereign. The\r\nhonorary degree of M.A. which conveys no civil rights to its possessor,\r\nhaving been formerly given to the secretary of the ambassador from\r\nMorocco, it was triumphantly urged that the University of Cambridge\r\nhad a greater regard for a Mahometan than for a Roman Catholic, and\r\nwas more obsequious to the ambassador from Morocco than to their own\r\nlawful sovereign. Though this reasoning might impose upon the ignorant,\r\nit produced little effect upon the members of the university. A few\r\nweak-minded individuals, however, were disposed to yield a reluctant\r\nconsent to the royal wishes. They proposed to confer the degree,\r\nand at the same time to resolve that it should not in future be\r\nregarded as a precedent. To this it was replied, that the very act of\r\nsubmission in one case would be a stronger argument for continuing the\r\npractice than any such resolution would be against its repetition. The\r\nuniversity accordingly remained firm in their original decision. The\r\nvice-chancellor was summoned before the ecclesiastical commission to\r\nanswer for this act of contempt. Newton was among the number of those\r\nwho resisted the wishes of the court, and he was consequently chosen\r\none of the nine delegates who were appointed to defend the independence\r\nof the university. These delegates appeared before the High Court. They\r\nmaintained that not a single precedent could be found to justify so\r\nextraordinary a measure; and they showed that Charles II. had, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, been pleased to withdraw his mandamus. This\r\nrepresentation had its full weight, and the king was induced to abandon\r\nhis design.[73]\r\n\r\nThe part which Newton had taken in this affair, and the high character\r\nwhich he now held in the scientific world, induced his friends to\r\npropose him as member of parliament for the university. He was\r\naccordingly elected in 1688, though by a very narrow majority,[74] and\r\nhe sat in the Convention Parliament till its dissolution. In the year\r\n1688 and 1689, Newton was absent from Cambridge during the greater part\r\nof the year, owing, we presume, to his attendance in parliament; but\r\nit appears from the books of the University that from 1690 to 1695 he\r\nwas seldom absent, and must therefore have renounced his parliamentary\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in London he had no doubt experienced the\r\nunsuitableness of his income to the new circumstances in which he was\r\nplaced, and it is probable that this was the cause of the limitation of\r\nhis residence to Cambridge. His income was certainly very confined, and\r\nbut little suited to the generosity of his disposition. Demands were\r\ndoubtless made upon it by some of his less wealthy relatives; and there\r\nis reason to think that he himself, as well as his influential friends,\r\nhad been looking forward to some act of liberality on the part of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAn event however occurred which will ever form an epoch in his history;\r\nand it is a singular circumstance, that this incident has been for more\r\nthan a century unknown to his own countrymen, and has been accidentally\r\nbrought to light by the examination of the manuscripts of Huygens. This\r\nevent has been magnified into a temporary aberration of mind, which is\r\nsaid to have arisen from a cause scarcely adequate to its production.\r\n\r\nWhile he was attending divine service in a winter morning, he had left\r\nin his study a favourite little dog called Diamond. Upon returning from\r\nchapel he found that it had overturned a lighted taper on his desk,\r\nwhich set fire to several papers on which he had recorded the results\r\nof some optical experiments. These papers are said to have contained\r\nthe labours of many years, and it has been stated that when Mr. Newton\r\nperceived the magnitude of his loss, he exclaimed, “Oh, Diamond,\r\nDiamond, little do you know the mischief you have done me!” It is a\r\ncurious circumstance that Newton never refers to the experiments which\r\nhe is said to have lost on this occasion, and his nephew, Mr. Conduit,\r\nmakes no allusion to the event itself. The distress, however which it\r\noccasioned is said to have been so deep as to affect even the powers of\r\nhis understanding.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary effect was first communicated to the world in the\r\nLife of Newton by M. Biot, who received the following account of it\r\nfrom the celebrated M. Van Swinden.\r\n\r\n“There is among the manuscripts of the celebrated Huygens a small\r\njournal in folio, in which he used to note down different occurrences.\r\nIt is side ζ, No. 8, p. 112, in the catalogue of the library of\r\nLeyden. The following extract is written by Huygens himself, with\r\nwhose handwriting I am well acquainted, having had occasion to peruse\r\nseveral of his manuscripts and autograph letters. ‘_On the 29th May,\r\n1694, M. Colin,[75] a Scotsman, informed me that eighteen months ago\r\nthe illustrious geometer, Isaac Newton, had become insane, either in\r\nconsequence of his too intense application to his studies, or from\r\nexcessive grief at having lost, by fire, his chymical laboratory and\r\nseveral manuscripts. When he came to the Archbishop of Cambridge, he\r\nmade some observations which indicated an alienation of mind. He was\r\nimmediately taken care of by his friends, who confined him to his house\r\nand applied remedies, by means of which he had now so far recovered his\r\nhealth that he began to understand the Principia._’” Huygens mentioned\r\nthis circumstance to Leibnitz, in a letter dated 8th June, 1694, to\r\nwhich Leibnitz replies in a letter dated the 23d, “I am very glad that\r\nI received information of the cure of Mr. Newton, at the same time\r\nthat I first heard of his illness, which doubtless must have been\r\nvery alarming. ‘It is to men like you and him, sir, that I wish a long\r\nlife.’”\r\n\r\nThe first publication of the preceding statement produced a strong\r\nsensation among the friends and admirers of Newton. They could not\r\neasily believe in the prostration of that intellectual strength which\r\nhad unbarred the strongholds of the universe. The unbroken equanimity\r\nof Newton’s mind, the purity of his moral character, his temperate and\r\nabstemious life, his ardent and unaffected piety, and the weakness of\r\nhis imaginative powers, all indicated a mind which was not likely to\r\nbe overset by any affliction to which it could be exposed. The loss of\r\na few experimental records could never have disturbed the equilibrium\r\nof a mind like his. If they were the records of discoveries, the\r\ndiscoveries themselves indestructible would have been afterward given\r\nto the world. If they were merely the details of experimental results,\r\na little time could have easily reproduced them. Had these records\r\ncontained the first fruits of early genius—of obscure talent, on which\r\nfame had not yet shed its rays, we might have supposed that the first\r\nblight of such early ambition would have unsettled the stability of\r\nan untried mind. But Newton was satiated with fame. His mightiest\r\ndiscoveries were completed and diffused over all Europe, and he must\r\nhave felt himself placed on the loftiest pinnacle of earthly ambition.\r\nThe incredulity which such views could not fail to encourage was\r\nincreased by the novelty of the information. No English biographer\r\nhad ever alluded to such an event. History and tradition were equally\r\nsilent, and it was not easy to believe that the Lucasian Professor of\r\nMathematics at Cambridge, a member of the English parliament, and the\r\nfirst philosopher in Europe could have lost his reason without the\r\ndreadful fact being known to his own countrymen.\r\n\r\nBut if the friends of Newton were surprised by the nature of the\r\nintelligence, they were distressed at the view which was taken of it\r\nby foreign philosophers. While one maintained that the intellectual\r\nexertions of Newton had terminated with the publication of the\r\nPrincipia, and that the derangement of his mind was the cause of his\r\nabandoning the sciences, others indirectly questioned the sincerity of\r\nhis religious views, and ascribed to the aberration of his mind those\r\ntheological pursuits which gilded his declining age. “But the fact,”\r\nsays M. Biot, “of the derangement of his intellect, whatever may have\r\nbeen the cause of it, will explain why, after the publication of the\r\nPrincipia in 1687, Newton, though only forty-five years old, never\r\nmore published a new work on any branch of science, but contented\r\nhimself with giving to the world those which he had composed long\r\nbefore that epoch, confining himself to the completion of those\r\nparts which might require development. We may also remark, that even\r\nthese developments appear always to be derived from experiments and\r\nobservations formerly made, such as the additions to the second edition\r\nof the Principia, published in 1713, the experiments on thick plates,\r\nthose on diffraction, and the chymical queries placed at the end of the\r\nOptics in 1704; for in giving an account of these experiments Newton\r\ndistinctly says that they were taken from ancient manuscripts which he\r\nhad formerly composed; and he adds, that though he felt the necessity\r\nof extending them, or rendering them more perfect, he was not able to\r\nresolve to do this, these matters being no longer in his way. Thus\r\nit appears that though he had recovered his health sufficiently to\r\nunderstand all his researches, and even in some cases to make additions\r\nto them, and useful alterations, as appears from the second edition\r\nof the Principia, for which he kept up a very active mathematical\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Cotes, yet he did not wish to undertake new\r\nlabours in those departments of science where he had done so much,\r\nand where he so distinctly saw what remained to be done.” Under the\r\ninfluence of the same opinion, M. Biot finds “it extremely probable\r\nthat his dissertation on the scale of heat was written before the fire\r\nin his laboratory;” he describes Newton’s conduct about the longitude\r\nbill as “almost puerile on so solemn an occasion, and one which might\r\nlead to the strangest conclusions, particularly if we refer it to the\r\nfatal accident which Newton had suffered in 1695.”\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Marquis de la Place viewed the illness of Newton in\r\na light still more painful to his friends. He maintained that he\r\nnever recovered the vigour of his intellect, and he was persuaded\r\nthat Newton’s theological inquiries did not commence till after that\r\nafflicting epoch of his life. He even commissioned Professor Gautier of\r\nGeneva to make inquiries on this subject during his visit to England,\r\nas if it concerned the interests of truth and justice to show that\r\nNewton became a Christian and a theological writer only after the decay\r\nof his strength and the eclipse of his reason.\r\n\r\nSuch having been the consequences of the disclosure of Newton’s illness\r\nby the manuscript of Huygens, I felt it to be a sacred duty to the\r\nmemory of that great man, to the feelings of his countrymen, and to\r\nthe interests of Christianity itself, to inquire into the nature\r\nand history of that indisposition which seems to have been so much\r\nmisrepresented and misapplied. From the ignorance of so extraordinary\r\nan event which has prevailed for such a long period in England, it\r\nmight have been urged with some plausibility that Huygens had mistaken\r\nthe real import of the information that was conveyed to him; or that\r\nthe Scotchman from whom he received it had propagated an idle and a\r\ngroundless rumour. But we are, fortunately, not confined to this very\r\nreasonable mode of defence. There exists at Cambridge a manuscript\r\njournal written by Mr. Abraham de la Pryme, who was a student in the\r\nuniversity while Newton was a fellow of Trinity. This manuscript is\r\nentitled “_Ephemeris Vitæ_, or Diary of my own Life, containing an\r\naccount likewise of the most observable and remarkable things that I\r\nhave taken notice of from my youth up hitherto.” Mr. de la Pryme was\r\nborn in 1671, and begins the diary in 1685. This manuscript is in the\r\npossession of his collateral descendant, George Pryme, Esq., Professor\r\nof Political Economy at Cambridge, to whom I have been indebted for the\r\nfollowing extract.\r\n\r\n“_1692, February 3d._—What I heard to-day I must relate. There is one\r\nMr. Newton (whom I have very oft seen), Fellow of Trinity College,\r\nthat is mighty famous for his learning, being a most excellent\r\nmathematician, philosopher, divine, &c. He has been Fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society these many years; and among other very learned books\r\nand tracts, he’s written one upon the mathematical principles of\r\nphilosophy, which has got him a mighty name, he having received,\r\nespecially from Scotland, abundance of congratulatory letters for\r\nthe same; but of all the books that he ever wrote, there was one of\r\ncolours and light, established upon thousands of experiments which he\r\nhad been twenty years of making, and which had cost him many hundred\r\nof pounds. This book, which he valued so much, and which was so much\r\ntalked of, had the ill luck to perish and be utterly lost just when the\r\nlearned author was almost at putting a conclusion at the same, after\r\nthis manner: In a winter’s morning, leaving it among his other papers\r\non his study table while he went to chapel, the candle, which he had\r\nunfortunately left burning there too, catched hold by some means of\r\nother papers, and they fired the aforesaid book, and utterly consumed\r\nit and several other valuable writings; and, which is most wonderful,\r\ndid no further mischief. But when Mr. Newton came from chapel, and had\r\nseen what was done, every one thought he would have run mad, he was\r\nso troubled thereat that he was not himself for a month after. A long\r\naccount of this his system of light and colours you may find in the\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society, which he had sent up to them long\r\nbefore this sad mischance happened unto him.”\r\n\r\nFrom this extract we are enabled to fix the approximate date of the\r\naccident by which Newton lost his papers. It must have been previous to\r\nthe 3d January, 1692, a month before the date of the extract; but if we\r\nfix it by the dates in Huygens’s manuscript, we should place it about\r\nthe 29th November, 1692, eighteen months previous to the conversation\r\nbetween Collins and Huygens. The manner in which Mr. Pryme refers to\r\nNewton’s state of mind is that which is used every day when we speak\r\nof the loss of tranquillity which arises from the ordinary afflictions\r\nof life; and the meaning of the passage amounts to nothing more than\r\nthat Newton was very much troubled by the destruction of his papers,\r\nand did not recover his serenity, and return to his usual occupations,\r\nfor a month. The very phrase that “every person thought he would have\r\nrun mad” is in itself a proof that no such effect was produced; and,\r\nwhatever degree of indisposition may be implied in the phrase “he was\r\nnot himself for a month after,” we are entitled to infer that one month\r\nwas the period of its duration, and that previous to the 3d February,\r\n1692, the date of Mr. Pryme’s memorandum, “Newton was himself again.”\r\n\r\nThese facts and dates cannot be reconciled with those in Huygens’s\r\nmanuscript. It appears from that document, that, so late as May, 1694,\r\nNewton had only so far recovered his health as _to begin to again\r\nunderstand the Principia_. His supposed malady, therefore, was in force\r\nfrom the 3d of January, 1692, till the month of May, 1694,—a period\r\nof more than two years. Now, it is a most important circumstance,\r\nwhich M. Biot ought to have known, that in _the very middle of this\r\nperiod_, Newton wrote his four celebrated letters to Dr. Bentley on\r\nthe Existence of a Deity,—letters which evince a power of thought and\r\na serenity of mind absolutely incompatible even with the slightest\r\nobscuration of his faculties. No man can peruse these letters without\r\nthe conviction that their author then possessed the full vigour of\r\nhis reason, and was capable of understanding the most profound parts\r\nof his writings. The first of these letters was written on the 10th\r\nDecember, 1692, the second on the 17th January, 1693, the third on\r\nthe 25th February, and the 4th on the 11th[76] February, 1693. His\r\nmind was, therefore, strong and vigorous on these four occasions; and\r\nas the letters were written at the express request of Dr. Bentley,\r\nwho had been appointed to deliver the lecture founded by Mr. Boyle\r\nfor vindicating the fundamental principles of natural and revealed\r\nreligion, we must consider such a request as showing his opinion of the\r\nstrength and freshness of his friend’s mental powers.\r\n\r\nIn 1692, Newton, at the request of Dr. Wallis, transmitted to him the\r\nfirst proposition of his book on quadratures, with examples of it in\r\nfirst, second, and third fluxions.[77] These examples were written in\r\nconsequence of an application from his friend; and the author of the\r\nreview of the Commercium Epistolicum, in which this fact is quoted,\r\ndraws the conclusion, that he had not at that time forgotten his method\r\nof second fluxions. It appears, also, from the second book of the\r\nOptics,[78] that in the month of June, 1692, he had been occupied with\r\nthe subject of haloes, and had made accurate observations both on the\r\ncolours and the diameters of the rings in a halo which he had then seen\r\naround the sun.\r\n\r\nBut though these facts stand in direct contradiction to the statement\r\nrecorded by Huygens, the reader will be naturally anxious to know the\r\nreal nature and extent of the indisposition to which it refers. The\r\nfollowing letters,[79] written by Newton himself, Mr. Pepys, Secretary\r\nto the Admiralty, and Mr. Millington of Magdalene College, Cambridge,\r\nwill throw much light upon the subject.\r\n\r\nNewton, as will be presently seen, had fallen into a bad state of\r\nhealth some time in 1692, in consequence of which both his sleep and\r\nhis appetite were greatly affected. About the middle of September,\r\n1693, he had been kept awake for five nights by this nervous disorder,\r\nand in this condition he wrote the following letter to Mr. Pepys:\r\n\r\n            _Sept. 13, 1693._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “Some time after Mr. Millington had delivered your message, he\r\n  pressed me to see you the next time I went to London. I was averse;\r\n  but upon his pressing consented, before I considered what I did,\r\n  for I am extremely troubled at the embroilment I am in, and have\r\n  neither ate nor slept well this twelvemonth, nor have my former\r\n  consistency of mind. I never designed to get any thing by your\r\n  interest, nor by King James’s favour, but am now sensible that I\r\n  must withdraw from your acquaintance, and see neither you nor the\r\n  rest of my friends any more, if I may but leave them quietly. I beg\r\n  your pardon for saying I would see you again, and rest your most\r\n  humble and most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n            “IS. NEWTON.”\r\n\r\nFrom this letter we learn, on his own authority, that his complaint had\r\nlasted for a twelvemonth, and that during that twelvemonth he neither\r\nate nor slept well, nor enjoyed his former _consistency of mind_. It\r\nis not easy to understand exactly what is meant by not enjoying his\r\nformer consistency of mind; but whatever be its import, it is obvious\r\nthat he must have been in a state of mind so sound as to enable him to\r\ncompose the four letters to Bentley, all of which were written during\r\nthe twelvemonth here referred to.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of this letter, his friend Mr. Pepys seems to have\r\nwritten to Mr. Millington of Magdalene College to inquire after Mr.\r\nNewton’s health; but the inquiry having been made in a vague manner,\r\nan answer equally vague was returned. Mr. Pepys, however, who seems to\r\nhave been deeply anxious about Newton’s health, addressed the following\r\nmore explicit letter to his friend Mr. Millington:—\r\n\r\n            _Septemb. 26, 1693._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “After acknowledging your many old favours, give me leave to do it\r\n  a little more particularly upon occasion of the new one conveyed\r\n  to me by my nephew Jackson. Though, at the same time, I must\r\n  acknowledge myself not at the ease I would be glad to be at in\r\n  reference to the excellent Mr. Newton; concerning whom (methinks)\r\n  your answer labours under the same kind of restraint which (to tell\r\n  you the truth) my asking did. For I was loth at first dash to tell\r\n  you that I had lately received a letter from him so surprising to\r\n  me for the inconsistency of every part of it, as to be put into\r\n  great disorder by it, from the concernment I have for him, lest it\r\n  should arise from that which of all mankind I should least dread\r\n  from him and most lament for,—I mean a discomposure in head, or\r\n  mind, or both. Let me therefore beg you, sir, having now told you\r\n  the true ground of the trouble I lately gave you, to let me know\r\n  the very truth of the matter, as far at least as comes within your\r\n  knowledge. For I own too great an esteem for Mr. Newton, as for\r\n  a public good, to be able to let any doubt in me of this kind\r\n  concerning him lie a moment uncleared, where I can have any hopes\r\n  of helping it. I am, with great truth and respect, dear sir, your\r\n  most humble, and most affectionate servant,\r\n\r\n            “S. PEPYS.”\r\n\r\nTo this letter Mr. Millington made the following reply:—\r\n\r\n          _Coll. Magd. Camb._\r\n            _Sept. the 30, 1693._\r\n\r\n    “HONOR’D SIR,\r\n\r\n  “Coming home from a journey on the 28th instant at night, I met\r\n  with your letter which you were pleased to honour me with of the\r\n  26th. I am much troubled I was not at home in time for the post,\r\n  that I might as soon as possible put you out of your generous payne\r\n  that you are in for the worthy Mr. Newton. I was, I must confess,\r\n  very much surprised at the inquiry you were pleased to make by your\r\n  nephew about the message that Mr. Newton made the ground of his\r\n  letter to you, for I was very sure I never either received from\r\n  you or delivered to him any such, and therefore I went immediately\r\n  to wayt upon him, with a design to discourse him about the matter,\r\n  but, he was out of town, and since I have not seen him, till upon\r\n  the 28th I met him at Huntingdon, where, upon his own accord, and\r\n  before I had time to ask him any question, he told me that he had\r\n  writt to you a very odd letter, at which he was much concerned;\r\n  added, that it was in a distemper that much seized his head, and\r\n  that kept him awake for above five nights together, which upon\r\n  occasion he desired I would represent to you, and beg your pardon,\r\n  he being very much ashamed, he should be so rude to a person for\r\n  whom he hath so great an honour. He is now very well, and, though I\r\n  fear he is under some small degree of melancholy, yet I think there\r\n  is no reason to suspect it hath at all touched his understanding,\r\n  and I hope never will; and so I am sure all ought to wish that\r\n  love learning or the honour of our nation, _which it is a sign how\r\n  much it is looked after, when such a person as Mr. Newton lyes so\r\n  neglected by those in power_. And thus, honoured sir, I have made\r\n  you acquainted with all I know of the cause of such inconsistencys\r\n  in the letter of so excellent a person; and I hope it will\r\n  remove the doubts and fears you are, with so much compassion and\r\n  publickness of spirit, pleased to entertain about Mr. Newton; but\r\n  if I should have been wanting in any thing tending to the more full\r\n  satisfaction, I shall, upon the least notice, endeavour to amend it\r\n  with all gratitude and truth. Honored sir, your most faithfull and\r\n  most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n            “JOH. MILLINGTON.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pepys was perfectly satisfied with this answer, as appears from the\r\nfollowing letter:—\r\n\r\n            _October 3d, 1693._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “You have delivered me from a fear that indeed gave me much\r\n  trouble, and from my very heart I thank you for it; an evil to Mr.\r\n  Newton being what every good man must feel for his own sake as well\r\n  as his. God grant it may stopp here. And for the kind reflection\r\n  hee has since made upon his letter to mee, I dare not take upon mee\r\n  to judge what answer I should make him to it, or whether any or no;\r\n  and therefore pray that you will bee pleased either to bestow on\r\n  mee what directions you see fitt for my own guidance towards him in\r\n  it, or to say to him in my name, but your own pleasure, whatever\r\n  you think may be most welcome to him upon it, and most expressive\r\n  of my regard and affectionate esteem of him, and concernment for\r\n  him.    *    *    *\r\n\r\n            Dear sir, your most humble and most faithful servant,\r\n\r\n            “S. PEPYS.”\r\n\r\nIt does not appear from the memoirs of Mr. Pepys whether he ever\r\nreturned any answer to the letter of Mr. Newton which occasioned this\r\ncorrespondence; but we find that in less than two months after the\r\ndate of the preceding letter, an opportunity occurred of introducing\r\nto him a Mr. Smith, who wished to have his opinion on some problem in\r\nthe doctrine of chances. This letter from Pepys is dated November 22d,\r\n1693. Sir Isaac replied to it on the 26th November, and wrote to Pepys\r\nagain on the 16th December, 1693; and in both these letters he enters\r\nfully into the discussion of the mathematical question which had been\r\nsubmitted to his judgment.[80]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, from Newton’s letter to Mr. Pepys, that the subject of\r\nhis receiving some favour from the government had been a matter of\r\nanxiety with himself, and of discussion among his friends.[81] Mr.\r\nMillington was no doubt referring to this anxiety, when he represents\r\nNewton as an honour to the nation, and expresses his surprise “that\r\nsuch a person should _lye so neglected by those in power_.” And we find\r\nthe same subject distinctly referred to in two letters written to Mr.\r\nLocke during the preceding year. In one of these, dated January 26th,\r\n1691–2, he says, “Being fully convinced that Mr. Montague, upon an\r\nold grudge which I thought had been worn out, is false to me, I have\r\ndone with him, and intend to sit still, unless my Lord Monmouth be\r\nstill my friend.” Mr. Locke seems to have assured him of the continued\r\nfriendship of this nobleman, and Mr. Newton, still referring to the\r\nsame topic, in a letter dated February 16th, 1691–2, remarks, “I am\r\nvery glad Lord Monmouth is still my friend, but intend not to give\r\nhis lordship and you any farther trouble. My inclinations are to sit\r\nstill.” In a later letter to Mr. Locke, dated September, 1693, and\r\ngiven below, he asks his pardon for saying or thinking that there was\r\na design to sell him an office. In these letters Mr. Newton no doubt\r\nreferred to some appointment in London which he was solicitous to\r\nobtain, and which Mr. Montague and his other friends may have failed\r\nin procuring. This opinion is confirmed by the letter of Mr. Montague\r\nannouncing to him his appointment to the wardenship of the mint, in\r\nwhich he says that he is very glad he can _at last_ give him good proof\r\nof his friendship.\r\n\r\nIn the same month in which Newton wrote to Mr. Pepys, we find him in\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Locke. Displeased with his opinions respecting\r\ninnate ideas, he had rashly stated that they struck at the root of\r\nall morality; and that he regarded the author of such doctrines as a\r\nHobbist. Upon reconsidering these opinions, he addressed the following\r\nremarkable letter to Locke, written three days after his letter to Mr.\r\nPepys, and consequently during the illness under which he then laboured.\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “Being of opinion that you endeavoured to embroil me with women,\r\n  and by other means, I was so much affected with it, as that when\r\n  one told me you were sickly and would not live, I answered,\r\n  ’twere better if you were dead. I desire you to forgive me this\r\n  uncharitableness; for I am now satisfied that what you have done is\r\n  just, and I beg your pardon for my having hard thoughts of you for\r\n  it, and for representing that you struck at the root of morality,\r\n  in a principle you laid in your book of ideas, and designed to\r\n  pursue in another book, and that I took you for a Hobbist.[82] I\r\n  beg your pardon also for saying or thinking that there was a design\r\n  to sell me an office, or to embroil me.—I am your most humble and\r\n  unfortunate servant,\r\n\r\n            “IS. NEWTON.\r\n\r\n    “_At the Bull, in Shoreditch, London,\r\n        Sept. 16th, 1693._”\r\n\r\nTo this letter Locke returned the following answer, so nobly\r\ndistinguished by philosophical magnanimity and Christian charity:—\r\n\r\n            _Oates, Oct. 5th, 1693_.\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “I have been, ever since I first knew you, so entirely and\r\n  sincerely your friend, and thought you so much mine, that I could\r\n  not have believed what you tell me of yourself had I had it from\r\n  anybody else. And, though I cannot but be mightily troubled that\r\n  you should have had so many wrong and unjust thoughts of me,\r\n  yet next to the return of good offices, such as from a sincere\r\n  good-will I have ever done you, I receive your acknowledgment\r\n  of the contrary as the kindest thing you have done me, since it\r\n  gives me hopes I have not lost a friend I so much valued. After\r\n  what your letter expresses, I shall not need to say any thing to\r\n  justify myself to you. I shall always think your own reflection\r\n  on my carriage, both to you and all mankind, will sufficiently do\r\n  that. Instead of that, give me leave to assure you that I am more\r\n  ready to forgive you than you can be to desire it; and I do it so\r\n  freely and fully, that I wish for nothing more than the opportunity\r\n  to convince you that I truly love and esteem you, and that I have\r\n  the same good-will for you as if nothing of this had happened. To\r\n  confirm this to you more fully, I should be glad to meet you any\r\n  where, and the rather, because the conclusion of your letter makes\r\n  me apprehend it would not be wholly useless to you. But whether you\r\n  think it fit or not, I leave wholly to you. I shall always be ready\r\n  to serve you to my utmost, in any way you shall like, and shall\r\n  only need your commands or permission to do it.\r\n\r\n  “My book is going to press for a second edition; and, though I can\r\n  answer for the design with which I write it, yet, since you have so\r\n  opportunely given me notice of what you have said of it, I should\r\n  take it as a favour if you would point out to me the places that\r\n  gave occasion to that censure, that, by explaining myself better,\r\n  I may avoid being mistaken by others, or unawares doing the least\r\n  prejudice to truth or virtue. I am sure you are so much a friend to\r\n  them both, that, were you none to me, I could expect this from you.\r\n  But I cannot doubt but you would do a great deal more than this for\r\n  my sake, who, after all, have all the concern of a friend for you,\r\n  wish you extremely well, and am, without compliment, &c.”[83]\r\n\r\nTo this letter Newton made the following reply:—\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “The last winter, by sleeping too often by my fire, I got an ill\r\n  habit of sleeping; and a distemper, which this summer has been\r\n  epidemical, put me farther out of order, so that when I wrote to\r\n  you, I had not slept an hour a night for a fortnight together, and\r\n  for five days together not a wink. I remember I wrote to you, but\r\n  what I said of your book I remember not. If you please to send me a\r\n  transcript of that passage, I will give you an account of it if I\r\n  can.—I am your most humble servant,\r\n\r\n            “IS. NEWTON.\r\n\r\n    “_Cambridge, Oct. 5th, 1693._”\r\n\r\nAlthough the first of these letters evinces the existence of a nervous\r\nirritability which could not fail to arise from want of appetite and\r\nof rest, yet it is obvious that its author was in the full possession\r\nof his mental powers. The answer of Mr. Locke, indeed, is written upon\r\nthat supposition; and it deserves to be remarked, that Mr. Dugald\r\nStewart, who first published a portion of these letters, never imagines\r\nfor a moment that Newton was labouring under any mental alienation.\r\n\r\nThe opinion entertained by Laplace, that Newton devoted his attention\r\nto theology only in the latter part of his life, may be considered as\r\nderiving some countenance from the fact, that the celebrated general\r\nscholium at the end of the second edition of the Principia, published\r\nin 1713, did not appear in the first edition of that work. This\r\nargument has been ably controverted by Dr. J. C. Gregory of Edinburgh,\r\non the authority of a manuscript of Newton, which seems to have been\r\ntransmitted to his ancestor, Dr. David Gregory, between the years 1687\r\nand 1698. This manuscript, which consists of twelve folio pages in\r\nNewton’s handwriting, contains, in the form of additions and scholia to\r\nsome propositions in the third book of the Principia, an account of the\r\nopinions of the ancient philosophers on gravitation and motion, and on\r\nnatural theology, with various quotations from their works. Attached to\r\nthis manuscript are three very curious paragraphs. The first two appear\r\nto have been the original draught of the general scholium already\r\nreferred to; and the third relates to the subject of an ethereal\r\nmedium, respecting which he maintains an opinion diametrically opposite\r\nto that which he afterward published at the end of his Optics.[84]\r\nThe first paragraph expresses nearly the same ideas as some sentences\r\nin the scholium beginning “Deus summus est ens æternum, infinitum,\r\nabsolute perfectum;”[85] and it is remarkable that the second paragraph\r\nis found only in the third edition of the Principia, which appeared in\r\n1726, the year before Newton’s death.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the year 1694, about the time when our author is said\r\nto be beginning to understand the Principia, we find him occupied with\r\nthe difficult and profound subject of the lunar theory. In order to\r\nprocure observations for verifying the equations which he had deduced\r\nfrom the theory of gravity, he paid a visit to Flamstead, at the Royal\r\nObservatory of Greenwich, on the 1st September, 1694, when he received\r\nfrom him a series of lunar observations. On the 7th of October he\r\nwrote to Flamstead that he had compared the observations with his\r\ntheory, and had satisfied himself that by both together “the moon’s\r\ntheory may be reduced to a good degree of exactness, perhaps to the\r\nexactness of two or three minutes.” He wrote him again on the 24th\r\nOctober, and the correspondence was continued till 1698, Newton making\r\nconstant application for observations to compare with his theory of\r\nthe planetary motions; while Flamstead, not sufficiently aware of\r\nthe importance of the inquiry, received his requests as if they were\r\nidle intrusions in which the interests of science were but slightly\r\nconcerned.[86]\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the details which we have now given respecting the health\r\nand occupations of Newton from the beginning of 1692 till 1695, it is\r\nimpossible to draw any other conclusion than that he possessed a sound\r\nmind, and was perfectly capable of carrying on his mathematical, his\r\nmetaphysical, and his astronomical inquiries. His friend and admirer,\r\nMr. Pepys, residing within fifty miles of Cambridge, had never heard of\r\nhis being attacked with any illness till he inferred it from the letter\r\nto himself written in September, 1693. Mr. Millington, who lived in the\r\nsame university, had been equally unacquainted with any such attack,\r\nand, after a personal interview with Newton, for the express purpose of\r\nascertaining the state of his health, he assures Mr. Pepys “that he is\r\nvery well,—that he fears he is under some small degree of melancholy,\r\nbut that there is no reason to suspect that it hath at all touched his\r\nunderstanding.”\r\n\r\nDuring this period of bodily indisposition, his mind, though in a state\r\nof nervous irritability, and disturbed by want of rest, was capable of\r\nputting forth its highest powers. At the request of Dr. Wallis he drew\r\nup an example of one of his propositions on the quadrature of curves\r\nin second fluxions. He composed, at the desire of Dr. Bentley, his\r\nprofound and beautiful letters on the existence of the Deity. He was\r\nrequested by Locke to reconsider his opinions on the subject of innate\r\nideas; and we find him grappling with the difficulties of the lunar\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nBut with all these proofs of a vigorous mind, a diminution of his\r\nmental powers has been rashly inferred from the cessation of his\r\ngreat discoveries, and from his unwillingness to enter upon new\r\ninvestigations. The facts, however, here assumed are as incorrect as\r\nthe inference which is drawn from them. The ambition of fame is a\r\nyouthful passion, which is softened, if not subdued, by age. Success\r\ndiminishes its ardour, and early pre-eminence often extinguishes\r\nit. Before the middle period of life Newton was invested with all\r\nthe insignia of immortality; but endowed with a native humility of\r\nmind, and animated with those hopes which teach us to form an humble\r\nestimate of human greatness, he was satisfied with the laurels which\r\nhe had won, and he sought only to perfect and complete his labours.\r\nHis mind was principally bent on the improvement of the Principia; but\r\nhe occasionally diverged into new fields of scientific research,—he\r\nsolved problems of great difficulty which had been proposed to try his\r\nstrength,—and he devoted much of his time to profound inquiries in\r\nchronology and in theological literature.\r\n\r\nThe powers of his mind were therefore in full requisition; and, when\r\nwe consider that he was called to the discharge of high official\r\nfunctions which forced him into public life, and compelled him to\r\ndirect his genius into new channels, we can scarcely be surprised that\r\nhe ceased to produce any original works on abstract science. In the\r\ndirection of the affairs of the mint, and of the Royal Society, to\r\nwhich we shall now follow him, he found ample occupation for his time;\r\nwhile the leisure of his declining years was devoted to those exalted\r\nstudies in which philosophy yields to the supremacy of faith, and hope\r\nadministers to the aspirations of genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  _No Mark of National Gratitude conferred upon Newton—Friendship\r\n    between him and Charles Montague, afterward Earl of Halifax—Mr.\r\n    Montague appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1694—He resolves\r\n    upon a Recoinage—Nominates Mr. Newton Warden of the Mint in 1695—\r\n    Mr. Newton appointed Master of the Mint in 1699—Notice of the Earl\r\n    of Halifax—Mr. Newton elected Associate of the Academy of Sciences\r\n    in 1699—Member for Cambridge in 1701—and President of the Royal\r\n    Society in 1703—Queen Anne confers upon him the Honour of Knighthood\r\n    in 1705—Second Edition of the Principia, edited by Cotes—His\r\n    Conduct respecting Mr. Ditton’s Method of finding the Longitude._\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have viewed Newton chiefly as a philosopher leading a life\r\nof seclusion within the walls of a college, and either engaged in the\r\nduties of his professorship, or ardently occupied in mathematical\r\nand scientific inquiries. He had now reached the fifty-third year of\r\nhis age, and while those of his own standing at the university had\r\nbeen receiving high appointments in the church, or lucrative offices\r\nin the state, he still remained without any mark of the respect or\r\ngratitude of his country. All Europe indeed had been offering incense\r\nto his name, and Englishmen themselves boasted of him as the pride\r\nof their country and the ornament of their species, but he was left\r\nin comparative poverty,[87] with no other income than the salary of\r\nhis professorship, eked out with the small rental of his paternal\r\ninheritance. Such disregard of the highest genius, dignified by the\r\nhighest virtue, could have taken place only in England, and we should\r\nhave ascribed it to the turbulence of the age in which he lived, had\r\nwe not seen, in the history of another century, that the successive\r\ngovernments which preside over the destinies of our country have never\r\nbeen able either to feel or to recognise the true nobility of genius.\r\n\r\nAmong his friends at Cambridge Newton had the honour of numbering\r\nCharles Montague, grandson of Henry Earl of Manchester, a young man of\r\nhigh promise, and every way worthy of his friendship. Though devoted to\r\nliterary pursuits, and twenty years younger than Newton, he cherished\r\nfor the philosopher all the veneration of a disciple, and his affection\r\nfor him gathered new strength as he rose to the highest honours and\r\noffices of the state. In the year 1684 we find him co-operating with\r\nNewton in the establishment of a philosophical society at Cambridge;\r\nbut though both of them had made personal application to different\r\nindividuals to become members, yet the plan failed, from the want, as\r\nNewton expresses it, of persons willing to try experiments.\r\n\r\nMr. Montague sat along with Newton in the convention parliament, and\r\nsuch were the powers which he displayed in that assembly as a public\r\nspeaker, that he was appointed a commissioner of the treasury, and\r\nsoon afterward a privy counsellor. In these situations his talents\r\nand knowledge of business were highly conspicuous, and in 1694 he was\r\nappointed chancellor of the exchequer. The current coin of the nation\r\nhaving been adulterated and debased, one of his earliest designs was to\r\nrecoin it and restore it to its intrinsic value. This scheme, however,\r\nmet with great opposition. It was characterized as a wild project,\r\nunsuitable to a period of war, as highly injurious to the interests\r\nof commerce, and as likely to sap the foundation of the government.\r\nBut he had weighed the subject too deeply, and had intrenched himself\r\nbehind opinions too impartial and too well-founded, to be driven from a\r\nmeasure which the best interests of his country seemed to require.\r\n\r\nThe persons whom Mr. Montague had consulted about the recoinage were\r\nNewton, Locke, and Halley, and in consequence of Mr. Overton, the\r\nwarden of the mint, having been appointed a commissioner of customs, he\r\nembraced the opportunity which was thus offered of serving his friend\r\nand his country by recommending Newton to that important office. The\r\nnotice of this appointment was conveyed in the following letter to\r\nNewton.\r\n\r\n            _London, 19th March, 1695._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “I am very glad that, at last, I can give you a good proof of\r\n  my friendship, and the esteem the king has of your merits. Mr.\r\n  Overton, the warden of the mint, is made one of the commissioners\r\n  of the customs, and the king has promised me to make Mr. Newton\r\n  warden of the mint. The office is the most proper for you. ’Tis the\r\n  chief office in the mint, ’tis worth five or six hundred pounds per\r\n  annum, and has not too much business to require more attendance\r\n  than you can spare. I desire that you will come up as soon as you\r\n  can, and I will take care of your warrant in the mean time. Let me\r\n  see you as soon as you come to town, that I may carry you to kiss\r\n  the king’s hand. I believe you may have a lodging near me.—I am, &c.\r\n\r\n            CHARLES MONTAGUE.”\r\n\r\nIn this new situation the mathematical and chymical knowledge of our\r\nauthor was of great service to the nation, and he became eminently\r\nuseful in carrying on the recoinage, which was completed in the short\r\nspace of two years. In the year 1699, he was promoted to the mastership\r\nof the mint,—an office which was worth twelve or fifteen hundred pounds\r\nper annum, and which he held during the remainder of his life. In this\r\nsituation he wrote an official report on the Coinage, which has been\r\npublished; and he drew up a table of Assays of Foreign Coins, which is\r\nprinted at the end of Dr. Arbuthnot’s Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights,\r\nand Measures, which appeared in 1727.\r\n\r\nWhile our author filled the inferior office of warden of the mint,\r\nhe retained his professorship at Cambridge; but upon his promotion\r\nin 1699, he appointed Mr. Whiston to be his deputy, with all the\r\nemoluments of the office; and when he resigned the chair in 1703, he\r\nsucceeded in getting him nominated his successor.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Newton to the mastership of the mint must have been\r\npeculiarly gratifying to the Royal Society, and it was probably from\r\na feeling of gratitude to Mr. Montague, as much as from a regard for\r\nhis talents, that this able statesman was elected president of that\r\nlearned body on the 30th November, 1695. This office he held for three\r\nyears, and on the 30th January, 1697, Newton had the satisfaction of\r\naddressing to him his solution of the celebrated problems proposed by\r\nJohn Bernouilli.\r\n\r\nThis accomplished nobleman was created Earl of Halifax in 1700, and\r\nafter the death of his first wife he conceived a strong attachment for\r\nMrs. Catharine Barton, the widow of Colonel Barton, and the niece of\r\nNewton. This lady was young, gay, and beautiful, and though she did\r\nnot escape the censures of her contemporaries, she was regarded by\r\nthose who knew her as a woman of strict honour and virtue. We are not\r\nacquainted with the causes which prevented her union with the Earl of\r\nHalifax, but so great was the esteem and affection which he bore her,\r\nthat in the will in which he left 100_l._ to Mr. Newton, he bequeathed\r\nto his niece a very large portion of his fortune. This distinguished\r\nstatesman died in 1715, in the fifty-fourth year of his age. Himself a\r\npoet and an elegant writer, he was the liberal patron of genius, and he\r\nnumbered among his intimate friends Congreve, Halley, Prior, Tickell,\r\nSteele, and Pope. His conduct to Newton will be for ever remembered\r\nin the annals of science. The sages of every nation and of every age\r\nwill pronounce with affection the name of Charles Montague, and the\r\npersecuted science of England will continue to deplore that he was\r\nthe first and the last English minister who honoured genius by his\r\nfriendship and rewarded it by his patronage.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Mr. Newton to the highest offices in the mint was\r\nfollowed by other marks of honour. The Royal Academy of Sciences at\r\nParis having been empowered by a new charter granted in 1699, to admit\r\na very small number of foreign associates, Newton was elected a member\r\nof that distinguished body. In the year 1701, on the assembling of a\r\nnew parliament, he was re-elected one of the members for the University\r\nof Cambridge.[88] In 1703 he was chosen President of the Royal Society\r\nof London, and he was annually re-elected to this office during the\r\nremaining twenty-five years of his life. On the 16th of April, 1705,\r\nwhen Queen Anne was living at the royal residence of Newmarket, she\r\nwent with Prince George of Denmark and the rest of the court to visit\r\nthe University of Cambridge. After the meeting of the Regia Consilia,\r\nher majesty held a court at Trinity Lodge, the residence of Dr.\r\nBentley, then master of Trinity; where the honour of knighthood was\r\nconferred upon Mr. Newton, Mr. John Ellis, the vice-chancellor, and Mr.\r\nJames Montague, the university counsel.[89]\r\n\r\nOn the dissolution of the parliament, which took place in 1705, Sir\r\nIsaac was again a candidate for the representation of the University,\r\nbut notwithstanding the recent expression of the royal favour, he\r\nlost his election by a very great majority.[90] This singular result\r\nwas perhaps owing to the loss of that personal influence which his\r\nresidence in the university could not fail to command, though it is\r\nmore probable that the ministry preferred the candidates of a more\r\nobsequious character, and that the electors looked for advantages which\r\nSir Isaac Newton was not able to obtain for them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first edition of the Principia had been for some time\r\nsold off, and copies of it had become extremely rare, yet Sir Isaac’s\r\nattention was so much occupied with his professional avocations that\r\nhe could not find leisure for preparing a new edition. Dr. Bentley,\r\nwho had repeatedly urged him to this task, at last succeeded, by\r\nengaging Roger Cotes, Plumian Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, to\r\nsuperintend its publication at the university press. In June, 1709,\r\nSir Isaac committed this important trust to his young friend; and\r\nabout the middle of July he promised to send him in the course of a\r\nfortnight his own revised copy of the work. Business, however, seems to\r\nhave intervened, and Mr. Cotes was obliged to remind Sir Isaac of his\r\npromise, which he did in the following letter:—\r\n\r\n            _Cambridge, Aug. 18th, 1709._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “The earnest desire I have to see a new edition of your _Principia_\r\n  makes me somewhat impatient till we receive your copy of it, which\r\n  you were pleased to promise me about the middle of last month\r\n  you would send down in about a fortnight’s time. I hope you will\r\n  pardon me for this uneasiness, from which I cannot free myself,\r\n  and for giving you this trouble to let you know it. I have been so\r\n  much obliged by yourself and by your book, that (I desire you to\r\n  believe me) I think myself bound in gratitude to take all the care\r\n  I possibly can that it shall be correct.—Your obliged servant,\r\n\r\n            “ROGER COTES.\r\n\r\n    “_For Sir Isaac Newton, at his house in\r\n        Jermyn-street, near St. James’s\r\n            Church, Westminster._”\r\n\r\nThis was the first letter of that celebrated correspondence, consisting\r\nof nearly three hundred letters, in which Sir Isaac and Mr. Cotes\r\ndiscussed the various improvements which were thought necessary in a\r\nnew edition of the Principia. This valuable collection of letters is\r\npreserved in the library of Trinity College; and we cannot refrain\r\nfrom repeating the wish expressed by Dr. Monk, “that one of the many\r\naccomplished Newtonians who are resident in that society would favour\r\nthe world by publishing the whole collection.”\r\n\r\nWhen the work was at last printed, Mr. Cotes expressed a wish that Dr.\r\nBentley should write the preface to it, but it was the opinion both of\r\nSir Isaac and Dr. Bentley that the preface should come from the pen of\r\nMr. Cotes himself. This he accordingly undertook; but previous to its\r\nexecution he addressed the following letter to Dr. Bentley, in order\r\nto learn from Sir Isaac the particular view with which it should be\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n            _March 10th, 1712–13._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “I received what you wrote to me in Sir Isaac’s letter. I will set\r\n  about the index in a day or two. As for the preface, I should be\r\n  glad to know from Sir Isaac with what view he thinks proper to have\r\n  it written. You know the book has been received abroad with some\r\n  disadvantage, and the cause of it may be easily guessed at. The\r\n  _Commercium Epistolicum_, lately published by order of the Royal\r\n  Society, gives such indubitable proofs of Mr. Leibnitz’s want of\r\n  candour, that I shall not scruple in the least to speak out the\r\n  full truth of the matter, if it be thought convenient. There are\r\n  some pieces of his looking this way which deserve a censure, as\r\n  his _Tentamen de motuum cælestium causis_. If Sir Isaac is willing\r\n  that something of this nature may be done, I should be glad if,\r\n  while I am making the index, he would consider of it, and put down\r\n  a few notes of what he thinks most material to be insisted on.\r\n  This I say upon supposition that I write the preface myself. But I\r\n  think it will be much more advisable that you, or he, or both of\r\n  you should write it while you are in town. You may depend upon it I\r\n  will own it, and defend it as well as I can, if hereafter there be\r\n  occasion.—I am sir, &c.”\r\n\r\nWe are not acquainted with the instructions which were given to Mr.\r\nCotes in consequence of this application; but it appears from the\r\npreface itself, which contains a long and able summary of the Newtonian\r\nphilosophy, that Sir Isaac had prohibited any personal reference to the\r\nconduct of Leibnitz.\r\n\r\nThe general preface is dated 12th May, 1713, and in a subsidiary\r\npreface of only a few lines, dated March 28th, 1713, Sir Isaac mentions\r\nthe leading alterations which had been made in this edition. The\r\ndetermination of the forces by which bodies may revolve in given orbits\r\nwas simplified and enlarged. The theory of the resistance of fluids\r\nwas more accurately investigated, and confirmed by new experiments.\r\nThe theory of the moon and the precession of the equinoxes were more\r\nfully deduced from their principles; and the theory of comets was\r\nconfirmed by several examples of their orbits more accurately computed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1714, several captains and owners of merchant vessels\r\npetitioned the House of Commons to consider the propriety of bringing\r\nin a bill to reward inventions for promoting the discovery of the\r\nlongitude at sea. A committee was appointed to investigate the subject,\r\nand Mr. Ditton and Mr. Whiston, having thought of a new method of\r\nfinding the longitude, submitted it to the committee. Four members of\r\nthe Royal Society, viz. Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Halley, Mr. Cotes, and\r\nDr. Clarke, were examined on the subject, along with Mr. Ditton and Mr.\r\nWhiston. The last three of these philosophers stated their opinions\r\nverbally. Mr. Cotes considered the proposed scheme as correct in theory\r\nand on shore, and both he and Dr. Halley were of opinion that expensive\r\nexperiments would be requisite. Newton, when called upon for his\r\nopinion, read the following memorandum, which deserves to be recorded.\r\n\r\n“For determining the longitude at sea there have been several projects,\r\ntrue in theory, but difficult to execute.\r\n\r\n“1. One is by a watch to keep time exactly; but by reason of the motion\r\nof the ship, the variation of heat and cold, wet or dry, and the\r\ndifference of gravity in different latitudes, such a watch hath not yet\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\n“2. Another is by the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites; but by reason\r\nof the length of telescopes requisite to observe them, and the motion\r\nof a ship at sea, those eclipses cannot yet be there observed.\r\n\r\n“3. A third is by the place of the moon; but her theory is not yet\r\nexact enough for that purpose; it is exact enough to determine the\r\nlongitude within two or three degrees, but not within a degree.\r\n\r\n“4. A fourth is Mr. Ditton’s project, and this is rather for keeping an\r\naccount of the longitude at sea than for finding it, if at any time it\r\nshould be lost, as it may easily be in cloudy weather. How far this is\r\npracticable, and with what charge, they that are skilled in sea affairs\r\nare best able to judge. In sailing by this method, whenever they are to\r\npass over very deep seas, they must sail due east or west; they must\r\nfirst sail into the latitude of the next place to which they are going\r\nbeyond it, and then keep due east or west till they come at that place.\r\nIn the first three ways there must be a watch regulated by a spring,\r\nand rectified every visible sunrise and sunset, to tell the hour of\r\nthe day or night. In the fourth way such a watch is not necessary.\r\nIn the first way there must be two watches, this and the other above\r\nmentioned. In any of the first three ways, it may be of some service to\r\nfind the longitude within a degree, and of much more service to find it\r\nwithin forty minutes, or half a degree if it may, and the success may\r\ndeserve rewards accordingly. In the fourth way, it is easier to enable\r\nseamen to know their distance and bearing from the shore 40, 60, or 80\r\nmiles off, than to cross the seas; and some part of the reward may be\r\ngiven when the first is performed on the coast of Great Britain for the\r\nsafety of ships coming home; and the rest when seamen shall be enabled\r\nto sail to an assigned remote harbour without losing their longitude if\r\nit may be.”\r\n\r\nThe committee brought up their report on the 11th June, and recommended\r\nthat a bill should be introduced into parliament for the purpose of\r\nrewarding inventions or discoveries connected with the determination of\r\nthe longitude. The bill passed the House of Commons on the 3d July, and\r\nwas agreed to by the Lords on the 8th of the same month.[91]\r\n\r\nIn giving an account of this transaction,[92] Mr. Whiston states,\r\nthat nobody understood Sir Isaac’s paper, and that after sitting down\r\nhe obstinately kept silence, though he was much pressed to explain\r\nhimself more distinctly. At last, seeing that the scheme was likely to\r\nbe rejected, Whiston ventured to say that Sir Isaac did not wish to\r\nexplain more through fear of compromising himself, but that he really\r\napproved of the plan. Sir Isaac, he goes on to say, repeated word for\r\nword what Whiston had said. This is the part of Mr. Newton’s conduct\r\nwhich M. Biot has described as puerile, and “tending to confirm the\r\nfact of the aberration of his intellect in 1693.” Before we can admit\r\nsuch a censure we must be satisfied with the correctness of Whiston’s\r\nstatement. Newton’s paper is perfectly intelligible, and we may easily\r\nunderstand how he might have approved of Mr. Ditton’s plan as ingenious\r\nand practicable under particular circumstances, though he did not think\r\nit of that paramount importance which would have authorized the House\r\nof Commons to distinguish it by a parliamentary reward. The conflict\r\nbetween public duty and a disposition to promote the interests of Mr.\r\nWhiston and Mr. Ditton was no doubt the cause of that embarrassment of\r\nmanner which the former of these mathematicians has so unkindly brought\r\nbefore the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  _Respect in which Newton was held at the Court of George I.—The\r\n    Princess of Wales delighted with his Conversation—Leibnitz\r\n    endeavours to prejudice the Princess against Sir Isaac and Locke—\r\n    Controversy occasioned by his Conduct—The Princess obtains a\r\n    Manuscript Abstract of his System of Chronology—The Abbé Conti\r\n    is, at her request, allowed to take a Copy of it on the promise of\r\n    Secresy—He prints it surreptitiously in French, accompanied with a\r\n    Refutation by M.

His high situation under\r\ngovernment, his splendid reputation, his spotless character, and, above\r\nall, his unaffected piety attracted the attention of the Princess of\r\nWales, afterward queen-consort to George II. This lady, who possessed a\r\nhighly cultivated mind, derived the greatest pleasure from conversing\r\nwith Newton and corresponding with Leibnitz. In all her difficulties,\r\nshe received from Sir Isaac that information and assistance which\r\nshe had elsewhere sought in vain, and she was often heard to declare\r\nin public that she thought herself fortunate in living at a time\r\nwhich enabled her to enjoy the conversation of so great a genius. But\r\nwhile Newton was thus esteemed by the house of Hanover, Leibnitz, his\r\ngreat rival, endeavoured to weaken and undermine his influence. In\r\nhis correspondence with the princess, he represented the Newtonian\r\nphilosophy, not only as physically false, but as injurious to the\r\ninterests of religion. He asserted that natural religion was rapidly\r\ndeclining in England, and he supported this position by referring\r\nto the works of Locke, and to the beautiful and pious sentiments\r\ncontained in the 28th query at the end of the Optics. He represented\r\nthe principles of these great men as precisely the same with those of\r\nthe materialists, and thus endeavoured to degrade the character of\r\nEnglish philosophers.\r\n\r\nThese attacks of Leibnitz became subjects of conversation at court,\r\nand when they reached the ear of the king, his majesty expressed his\r\nexpectation that Sir Isaac Newton would draw up a reply. He accordingly\r\nentered the lists on the mathematical part of the controversy, and left\r\nthe philosophical part of it to Dr. Clarke, who was a full match for\r\nthe German philosopher. The correspondence which thus took place was\r\ncarefully perused by the princess, and from the estimation in which Sir\r\nIsaac continued to be held, we may infer that the views of the English\r\nphilosopher were not very remote from her own.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Isaac was one day conversing with her royal highness on\r\nsome points of ancient history, he was led to mention to her, and\r\nto explain, a new system of chronology which he composed during his\r\nresidence at Cambridge, where he was in the habit, as he himself\r\nexpresses it, “of refreshing himself with history and chronology when\r\nhe was weary with other studies.” The princess was so much pleased with\r\nhis ingenious system, that she subsequently, in the year 1718, sent a\r\nmessage by the Abbé Conti to Sir Isaac, requesting him to speak with\r\nher, and she, on this occasion, requested a copy of the interesting\r\nwork which contained his system of chronology. Sir Isaac informed her\r\nthat it existed merely in separate papers, which were not only in a\r\nstate of confusion, but which contained a very imperfect view of the\r\nsubject, and he promised, in a few days, to draw up an abstract of\r\nit for her own private use, and on the condition that it should not\r\nbe communicated to any other person. Some time after the princess\r\nreceived the manuscript, she requested that the Abbé Conti might be\r\nallowed to have a copy of it. Sir Isaac granted this request, and the\r\nAbbé was informed that he received a copy of the manuscript with Sir\r\nIsaac’s leave, and at the princess’s request, and that it was to be\r\nkept secret.[93] The manuscript which was thus rashly put into the\r\nhands of a foreigner was entitled “A Short Chronicle from the First\r\nMemory of Things in Europe to the Conquest of Persia by Alexander the\r\nGreat.” It consists of about twenty-four quarto printed pages,[94] with\r\nan introduction of four pages, in which Sir Isaac states that he “does\r\nnot pretend to be exact to a year, that there may be errors of five or\r\nten years, and sometimes twenty, but not much above.”\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Conti kept his promise of secrecy during his residence in\r\nEngland, but he no sooner reached Paris than he communicated it to M.\r\nFreret, a learned antiquarian, who not only translated it, but drew up\r\nobservations upon it for the purpose of refuting some of its principal\r\nresults. Sir Isaac was unacquainted with this transaction till he was\r\ninformed of it by the French bookseller, M. Cavalier, who requested\r\nhis leave to publish it, and charged one of his friends in London to\r\nprocure Sir Isaac’s answer, which was as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “I remember that I wrote a Chronological index for a particular\r\n  friend, on condition that it should not be communicated. As I have\r\n  not seen the manuscript which you have under my name, I know not\r\n  whether it be the same. That which I wrote was not at all done\r\n  with design to publish it. I intend not to meddle with that which\r\n  hath been given you under my name, nor to give any consent to the\r\n  publishing of it.—I am your very humble servant,\r\n\r\n            “ISAAC NEWTON.\r\n\r\n  “_London, May 27th, 1725_, O. S.”\r\n\r\nBefore this letter was written, viz. on the 21st May, the bookseller\r\nhad received the royal privilege for printing the work; and when it was\r\ncompleted, he sent a copy in a present to Sir Isaac, who received it on\r\nthe 11th November, 1725. It was entitled, _Abregé de Chronologie de M.\r\nLe Chevalier Newton, fait par lui-meme, et traduit sur le manuscript\r\nAnglais_, and was accompanied with observations by M. Freret,[95] the\r\nobject of which was to refute the leading points of the system.[96]\r\nAn advertisement was prefixed to it, in which the bookseller defends\r\nhimself for printing it without the author’s leave, on the ground\r\nthat he had written three letters to obtain permission, and had\r\ndeclared that he would take Sir Isaac’s silence for consent. When Sir\r\nIsaac received this work, he drew up a paper entitled, _Remarks on\r\nthe Observations made on a Chronological Index of Sir Isaac Newton,\r\ntranslated into French by the Observator, and published at Paris_,\r\nwhich was printed in the _Philosophical Transactions for 1725_.[97]\r\nIn this paper Sir Isaac gives a history of the transaction,—charges\r\nthe Abbé Conti with a breach of promise, and blames the publisher for\r\nhaving asked his leave to print the translation without sending him\r\na copy for his perusal, without acquainting him with the name of the\r\ntranslator, and without announcing his intention of printing along\r\nwith it a refutation of the original. The observations made by the\r\ntranslator against the conclusions deduced by the author were founded\r\non an imperfect knowledge of Sir Isaac’s system; and they are so\r\nspecious, that Halley himself confesses that he was at first prejudiced\r\nin favour of the observations, taking the calculations for granted, and\r\nnot having seen Sir Isaac’s work.\r\n\r\nTo all the observations of M. Freret Sir Isaac returned a triumphant\r\nanswer. This presumptuous antiquary had ventured to state at the end\r\nof his observations, “that he believed he had stated enough concerning\r\nthe epochs of the Argonauts, and the length of generations, to make\r\npeople cautious about the rest; for these are the two foundations of\r\nall this new system of chronology.” He founds his arguments against the\r\nepochs of the Argonauts, as fixed by our author, on the supposition\r\nthat Sir Isaac places the vernal equinox at the time of the Argonautic\r\nexpedition _in the middle of the sign of Aries_, whereas Sir Isaac\r\nplaces it _in the middle of the constellation_,—a point corresponding\r\nwith the middle of the back of Aries, or 8° from the first star of\r\nAries. This position of the colure is assigned on the authority of\r\nEudoxus, as given by Hipparchus, who says that the colure passed over\r\nthe back of Aries. Setting out with this mistake, M. Freret concludes\r\nthat the Argonautic expedition took place 532 years earlier than Sir\r\nIsaac made it. His second objection to the new system relates to the\r\nlength of generations, which he says is made only 18 or 20 years.\r\nSir Isaac, on the contrary, reckons a generation at 33 years, or 3\r\ngenerations at 100; and it was the lengths of the reigns of kings that\r\nhe made 18 or 20 years. This deduction he founds on the reigns of 64\r\nFrench kings. Now, the ancient Greeks and Egyptians reckoned the length\r\nof a reign equal to that of a generation; and it was by correcting this\r\nmistake, and adopting a measure founded on fact, that Sir Isaac placed\r\nthe Argonautic expedition forty-four years after the death of Solomon,\r\nand fixed some of the other points of his system.\r\n\r\nThis answer of Sir Isaac’s to the objections of Freret called into\r\nthe field a fresh antagonist, Father Souciet, who published five\r\ndissertations on the new chronology. These dissertations were written\r\nin a tone highly reprehensible; and the friends of Sir Isaac, being\r\napprehensive that the manner in which his system was attacked would\r\naffect him more than the arguments themselves, prevailed upon a friend\r\nto draw up an abstract of Souciet’s objections, stripped of the\r\n“extraordinary ornaments with which they were clothed.” The perusal of\r\nthese objections had no other effect upon him than to convince him of\r\nthe ignorance of their author; and he was induced to read the entire\r\nwork, which produced no change in his opinion.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these discussions, Sir Isaac was prevailed upon to\r\nprepare his larger work for the press. He had nearly completed it at\r\nthe time of his death, and it was published in 1728, under the title\r\nof _The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms amended, to which is prefixed\r\na short Chronicle_, from the first memory of Things in Europe _to\r\nthe Conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great_. It was dedicated to\r\nthe queen by Mr. Conduit, and consists of six chapters: 1. On the\r\nChronology of the Greeks;[98] 2. Of the Empire of Egypt; 3. Of the\r\nAssyrian Empire; 4. Of the two contemporary Empires of the Babylonians\r\nand Medes; 5. A Description of the Temple of Solomon; 6. Of the Empire\r\nof the Persians. The sixth chapter was not copied out with the other\r\nfive, which makes it doubtful whether or not it was intended for\r\npublication; but as it was found among his papers, and appeared to be a\r\ncontinuation of the same work, it was thought right to add it to the\r\nother five chapters.[99]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Newton, Dr. Halley, who had not yet seen the larger\r\nwork, felt himself called upon, both as astronomer-royal and as the\r\nfriend of the author, to reply to the first and last dissertations of\r\nFather Souciet, which were chiefly astronomical; and in two papers\r\nprinted in the Philosophical Transactions for 1727,[100] he has done\r\nthis in a most convincing and learned argument.\r\n\r\nAmong the supporters of the views of Newton, we may enumerate Dr. Reid,\r\nNauze, and some other writers; and among its opponents, M. Freret, who\r\nleft behind him a posthumous work on the subject, M. Fourmond, Mr.\r\nA. Bedford, Dr. Shuckford, Dr. Middleton, Whiston, and the late M.\r\nDelambre. The object of M. Fourmond is to show the uncertainty of the\r\nastronomical argument, arising on the one hand from the vague account\r\nof the ancient sphere as given by Hipparchus; and, on the other, from\r\nthe extreme rudeness of ancient astronomical observations. Delambre\r\nhas taken a similar view of the subject: he regards the observations\r\nof ancient astronomers as too incorrect to form the basis of a system\r\nof chronology; and he maintains, that if we admit the accuracy of the\r\ndetails in the sphere of Eudoxus, and suppose them all to belong to the\r\nsame epoch, all the stars which it contains ought at that epoch to be\r\nfound in the place where they are marked, and we might thence verify\r\nthe accuracy, and ascertain the state of the observations. It follows,\r\nhowever, from such an examination, that the sphere would indicate\r\nalmost as many different epochs as it contains stars. Some of them\r\neven had not, in the time of Eudoxus, arrived at the position which\r\nhad been for a long time attributed to them, and will not even reach\r\nit for three hundred years to come, and on this account he considers\r\nit impossible to deduce any chronological conclusions from such a rude\r\nmass of errors.\r\n\r\nBut however well-founded these observations may be, we agree in opinion\r\nwith M. Daunou,[101] “that they are not sufficient to establish a new\r\nsystem, and we must regard the system of Newton as a great fact in the\r\nhistory of chronological science, and as confirming the observation\r\nof Varro, that the stage of history does not commence till the first\r\nOlympiad.”\r\n\r\nAmong the chronological writings of Sir Isaac Newton we must enumerate\r\nhis _letter to a person of distinction who had desired his opinion of\r\nthe learned Bishop Lloyd’s hypothesis concerning the form of the most\r\nancient year_. This hypothesis was sent by the Bishop of Worcester to\r\nDr. Prideaux. Sir Isaac remarks, that it is filled with many excellent\r\nobservations on the ancient year; but he does not “find it proved that\r\nany ancient nations used a year of twelve months and 360 days without\r\ncorrecting it from time to time by the luminaries, to make the months\r\nkeep to the course of the moon, and the year to the course of the sun,\r\nand returns of the seasons and fruits of the earth.” After examining\r\nthe years of all the nations of antiquity, he concludes, “that no other\r\nyears are to be met with among the ancients but such as were either\r\nluni-solar, or solar or lunar, or the calendars of these years.” A\r\npractical year, he adds, of 360 days is none of these. The beginning of\r\nsuch a year would have run round the four seasons in seventy years,\r\nand such a notable revolution would have been mentioned in history, and\r\nis not to be asserted without proving it.[102]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  _Theological Studies of Sir Isaac—Their Importance to Christianity—\r\n    Motives to which they have been ascribed—Opinions of Biot and\r\n    Laplace considered—His Theological Researches begun before his\r\n    supposed Mental Illness—The Date of these Works fixed—Letters\r\n    to Locke—Account of his Observations on Prophecy—His Historical\r\n    Account of two notable Corruptions of Scripture—His Lexicon\r\n    Propheticum—His Four Letters to Dr. Bentley—Origin of Newton’s\r\n    Theological Studies—Analogy between the Book of Nature and that of\r\n    Revelation._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the theological studies of Sir Isaac Newton will ever\r\nbe regarded as one of the most interesting portions of his life. That\r\nhe who among all the individuals of his species possessed the highest\r\nintellectual powers was not only a learned and profound divine, but\r\na firm believer in the great doctrines of religion, is one of the\r\nproudest triumphs of the Christian faith. Had he distinguished himself\r\nonly by an external respect for the offices and duties of religion; and\r\nhad he left merely in his last words an acknowledgment of his faith,\r\nhis piety would have been regarded as a prudent submission to popular\r\nfeeling, and his last aspirations would have been ascribed to the decay\r\nor to the extinction of his transcendent powers. But he had been a\r\nChristian from his youth, and though never intended for the church,\r\nyet he interchanged the study of the Scriptures with that of the laws\r\nof the material universe; and from the examination of the works of the\r\nSupreme Creator he found it to be no abrupt transition to investigate\r\nthe revelation of his will, and to contemplate the immortal destinies\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nBut when the religious habits of Sir Isaac Newton could not be ascribed\r\nto an ambition of popularity, to the influence of weak health, or to\r\nthe force of professional impulse, it became necessary for the apostles\r\nof infidelity to refer it to some extraordinary cause. His supposed\r\ninsanity was therefore eagerly seized upon by some as affording\r\na plausible origin for his religious principles; while others,\r\nwithout any view of supporting the cause of skepticism, ascribed his\r\ntheological researches to the habits of the age in which he lived,\r\nand to a desire of promoting political liberty, by turning against\r\nthe abetters of despotism those powerful weapons which the Scriptures\r\nsupplied. The anxiety evinced by M. de Laplace to refer his religious\r\nwritings to a late period of his life seems to have been felt also by\r\nM. Biot, who has gone so far as to fix the very date of one of his most\r\nimportant works, and thus to establish the suspicions of his colleague.\r\n\r\n“From the nature of the subject,”[103] says he, “and from certain\r\nindications which Newton seems to give at the beginning of his\r\ndissertation, we may conjecture with probability that he composed it\r\nat the time when the errors of Whiston, and a work of Dr. Clarke on\r\nthe same subject, drew upon them the attacks of all the theologians of\r\nEngland, which would place the date between the years 1712 and 1719. It\r\nwould then be truly a prodigy to remark, that a man of from seventy-two\r\nto seventy-five years of age was able to compose, _rapidly_, as he\r\nleads us to believe, so extensive a piece of sacred criticism, of\r\nliterary history, and even of bibliography, where an erudition the\r\nmost vast, the most varied, and the most ready always supports an\r\nargument well arranged and powerfully combined. * * * At this epoch\r\nof the life of Newton the reading of religious books had become one\r\nof his most habitual occupations, and after he had performed the\r\nduties of his office, they formed, along with the conversation of his\r\nfriends, his principal amusement. He had then almost ceased to care\r\nfor the sciences, and, as we have already remarked, since the fatal\r\nepoch of 1693, he gave to the world only three really new scientific\r\nproductions.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the prodigy which it involves, M. Biot has adopted\r\n1712–1719 as the date of this critical dissertation;—it is regarded as\r\nthe composition of a man of seventy-two or seventy-five;—the reading\r\nof religious works is stated to have _become_ one of his most habitual\r\noccupations, and such reading is said to have been one of his principal\r\namusements; and all this is associated with “the fatal epoch of 1693,”\r\nas if his illness at that time had been the cause of his abandoning\r\nscience and betaking himself to theology. Carrying on the same views,\r\nM. Biot asks, in reference to Sir Isaac’s work on Prophecy, “How a mind\r\nof the character and force of Newton’s, so habituated to the severity\r\nof mathematical considerations, so exercised in the observation of real\r\nphenomena, and so well aware of the conditions by which truth is to be\r\ndiscovered, could put together such a number of conjectures without\r\nnoticing the extreme improbability of his interpretations from the\r\ninfinite number of arbitrary postulates on which he has founded them?”\r\nWe would apply the same question to the reasoning by which M. Biot\r\nfixes the date of the critical dissertation; and we would ask how so\r\neminent a philosopher could hazard such frivolous conjectures upon a\r\nsubject on which he had not a single fact to guide his inquiries. The\r\nobvious tendency, though not the design, of the conclusion at which\r\nhe arrives is injurious to the memory of Newton, as well as to the\r\ninterests of religion; and these considerations might have checked\r\nthe temerity of speculation, even if it had been founded on better\r\ndata. The Newtonian interpretation of the Prophecies, and especially\r\nthat part which M. Biot characterizes as unhappily stamped with the\r\nspirit of prejudice, has been adopted by men of the soundest and\r\nmost unprejudiced minds; and in addition to the moral and historical\r\nevidence by which it is supported, it may yet be exhibited in all the\r\nfulness of demonstration. But the speculation of Biot respecting the\r\ndate of Newton’s theological works was never maintained by any other\r\nperson than himself, and is capable of being disproved by the most\r\nincontrovertible evidence.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, in the extract from Mr. Pryme’s manuscript, that\r\nprevious to 1692, when a shade is supposed to have passed over his\r\ngifted mind, Newton was well known by the appellation of an “excellent\r\ndivine,”—a character which could not have been acquired without the\r\ndevotion of many years to theological researches; but, important as\r\nthis argument would have been, we are fortunately not left to so\r\ngeneral a defence. The correspondence of Newton with Locke, recently\r\npublished by Lord King, places it beyond a doubt that he had begun his\r\nresearches respecting the Prophecies before the year 1691,—before the\r\nforty-ninth year of his age, and before the “fatal epoch of 1693.” The\r\nfollowing letter shows that he had previously discussed this subject\r\nwith his friend:—\r\n\r\n            _Cambridge, Feb. 7, 1690–1._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “I am sorry your journey proved to so little purpose, though it\r\n  delivered you from the trouble of the company the day after. You\r\n  have obliged me by mentioning me to my friends at London, and I\r\n  must thank both you and my Lady Masham for your civilities at\r\n  Oates, and for not thinking that I made a long stay there. I hope\r\n  we shall meet again in due time, and then I should be glad to have\r\n  your judgment upon some of my mystical fancies. The Son of Man,\r\n  Dan. vii. I take to be the same with the Word of God upon the White\r\n  Horse in Heaven, Apoc. xii., for both are to rule the nations with\r\n  a rod of iron; but whence are you certain that the Ancient of\r\n  Days is Christ? Does Christ anywhere sit upon the throne? If Sir\r\n  Francis Masham be at Oates, present, I pray, my service to him,\r\n  with his lady, Mrs. Cudworth, and Mrs. Masham. Dr. Covel is not in\r\n  Cambridge.—I am your affectionate and humble servant,\r\n\r\n            “IS. NEWTON.\r\n\r\n  “Know you the meaning of Dan. x. 21. There is none that holdeth\r\n  with me in these things but Mich. the prince.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus determined the date of those investigations which\r\nconstitute his _observations on the prophecies of holy writ_,\r\nparticularly the prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse, we shall\r\nproceed to fix the latest date of his _historical account of two\r\nnotable corruptions of the Scripture, in a letter to a friend_.\r\n\r\nThis work seems to have been a _very early_ production of our author.\r\nIt was written in the form of a letter to Mr. Locke, and at that time\r\nSir Isaac seems to have been anxious for its publication. Afraid,\r\nhowever, of being again led into a controversy, and dreading the\r\nintolerance to which he might be exposed, he requested Mr. Locke, who\r\nwas at that time meditating a voyage to Holland, to get it translated\r\ninto French, and published on the Continent. Having abandoned his\r\ndesign of visiting Holland, Locke transmitted the manuscript, without\r\nNewton’s name, to his learned friend M. Le Clerc, in Holland; and\r\nit appears, from a letter of Le Clerc’s to Locke, that he must have\r\nreceived it before the 11th April, 1691. M. Le Clerc delayed for a\r\nlong time to take any steps regarding its publication; but in a letter\r\ndated January 20th, 1692, he announced to Locke his intention of\r\npublishing the tract in Latin. When this plan was communicated to Sir\r\nIsaac, he became alarmed at the risk of detection, and resolved to stop\r\nthe publication of his manuscript. This resolution was intimated to Mr.\r\nLocke in the following letter:\r\n\r\n            _Cambridge, Feb. 16th, 1691–2._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “Your former letters came not to my hand, but this I have. I was\r\n  of opinion my papers had lain still, and am sorry to hear there is\r\n  news about them. Let me entreat you to stop their translation and\r\n  impression so soon as you can; for I design to suppress them. If\r\n  your friend hath been at any pains and charge, I will repay it, and\r\n  gratify him. I am very glad my Lord Monmouth is till my friend, but\r\n  intend not to give his lordship and you any farther trouble. My\r\n  inclinations are to sit still. I am to beg his lordship’s pardon\r\n  for pressing into his company the last time I saw him. I had not\r\n  done it, but that Mr. Paulin pressed me into the room. Miracles, of\r\n  good credit, continued in the church for about two or three hundred\r\n  years. Gregorius Thaumaturgus had his name from thence, and was one\r\n  of the latest who was eminent for that gift; but of their number\r\n  and frequency I am not able to give you a just account. The history\r\n  of those ages is very imperfect. Mr. Paulin told me you had writ\r\n  for some of Mr. Boyle’s red earth, and by that I knew you had the\r\n  receipt.—Your most affectionate and humble servant,\r\n\r\n            “IS. NEWTON.”\r\n\r\nHence we see that this celebrated treatise, which Biot alleges to have\r\nbeen written between 1712 and 1719, was actually in the hands of Le\r\nClerc in Holland previous to the 11th April, 1691, and consequently\r\nprevious to the time of the supposed insanity of its author. Mr. Locke\r\nlost no time in obeying the request of his friend. Le Clerc instantly\r\nstopped the publication of the letter, and, as he had never learned\r\nthe name of the author, he deposited the manuscript, which was in the\r\nhandwriting of Mr. Locke, in the library of the Remonstrants, where it\r\nwas afterward found, and was published at London in 1754, under the\r\ntitle of _Two letters from Sir Isaac Newton to M. Le Clerc_,—a form\r\nwhich had never been given to it by its author. The copy thus published\r\nwas a very imperfect one, wanting both the beginning[104] and the end,\r\nand erroneous in many places; but Dr. Horsley has published a genuine\r\nedition, which has the form of a single letter to a friend, and was\r\ncopied from a manuscript in Sir Isaac Newton’s handwriting, in the\r\npossession of the Rev. Dr. Ekins, Dean of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nHaving thus determined as accurately as possible the dates of the\r\nprincipal theological writings of Sir Isaac, we shall now proceed to\r\ngive some account of their contents.\r\n\r\n_The Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St.\r\nJohn_ were published in London in 1733, in one volume 4to. The work is\r\ndivided into two parts, the first of which treats of the Prophecies of\r\nDaniel, and the second of the Apocalypse of St. John. It begins with\r\nan account of the different books which compose the Old Testament; and\r\nas the author considers Daniel to be the most distinct in the order of\r\ntime, and the easiest to be understood, he makes him the key to all\r\nthe prophetic books in those matters which relate to the “last time.”\r\nHe next considers the figurative language of the prophets, which he\r\nregards as taken “from the analogy between the world natural and an\r\nempire or kingdom considered as a world politic;” the heavens and the\r\nthings therein representing thrones and dynasties; the earth, with\r\nthe things therein, the inferior people; and the lowest parts of the\r\nearth the most miserable of the people. The sun is put for the whole\r\nrace of kings, the moon for the body of the common people, and the\r\nstars for subordinate princes and rulers. In the earth, the dry land\r\nand the waters are put for the people of several nations. Animals\r\nand vegetables are also put for the people of several regions. When\r\na beast or man is put for a kingdom, his parts and qualities are put\r\nfor the analogous parts and qualities of the kingdom; and when a man\r\nis taken in a mystical sense, his qualities are often signified by his\r\nactions, and by the circumstances and things about him. In applying\r\nthese principles he begins with the vision of the image composed of\r\nfour different metals. This image he considers as representing a body\r\nof four great nations which should reign in succession over the earth,\r\nviz. the people of Babylonia, the Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans;\r\nwhile the stone cut out without hands is a new kingdom which should\r\narise after the four, conquer all those nations, become very great, and\r\nendure to the end of time.\r\n\r\nThe vision of the four beasts is the prophecy of the four empires\r\nrepeated, with several new additions. The lion with eagles’ wings was\r\nthe kingdom of Babylon and Media, which overthrew the Assyrian power.\r\nThe beast like a bear was the Persian empire, and its three ribs were\r\nthe kingdoms of Sardis, Babylon, and Egypt. The third beast, like a\r\nleopard, was the Greek empire, and its four heads and four wings were\r\nthe kingdoms of Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus. The\r\nfourth beast, with its great iron teeth, was the Roman empire, and its\r\nten horns were the ten kingdoms into which it was broken in the reign\r\nof Theodosius the Great.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth chapter Sir Isaac treats of the kingdoms represented by\r\nthe feet of the image composed of iron and clay which did not stick\r\nto one another, and which were of different strength. These were the\r\nGothic tribes called Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Vandals, Gepidæ, Lombards,\r\nBurgundians, Alans, &c.; all of whom had the same manners and customs,\r\nand spoke the same language, and who, about the year 416 A. C. were\r\nall quietly settled in several kingdoms within the empire, not only by\r\nconquest, but by grants of emperor.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth chapter he treats of the _ten_ kingdoms represented by the\r\nten horns of the fourth beast, into which the western empire became\r\ndivided about the time when Rome was besieged and taken by the Goths.\r\nThese kingdoms were,\r\n\r\n     1. The kingdom of the Vandals and Alans in Spain and Africa.\r\n     2. The kingdom of Suevians in Spain.\r\n     3. The kingdom of the Visigoths.\r\n     4. The kingdom of the Alans in Gaul.\r\n     5. The kingdom of the Burgundians.\r\n     6. The kingdom of the Franks.\r\n     7. The kingdom of the Britains.\r\n     8. The kingdom of the Huns.\r\n     9. The kingdom of the Lombards.\r\n    10. The kingdom of Ravenna.\r\n\r\nSome of these kingdoms at length fell, and new ones sprung up; but\r\nwhatever was their subsequent number, they still retain the name of the\r\nten kings from their first number.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh horn of Daniel’s fourth beast is shown in chapter vii. to\r\nbe the Church of Rome in its triple character of a seer, a prophet, and\r\na king; and its power to change times and laws is copiously illustrated\r\nin chapter viii.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth chapter our author treats of the kingdom represented in\r\nDaniel by the ram and he-goat, the ram indicating the kingdom of the\r\nMedes and Persians from the beginning of the four empires, and the\r\nhe-goat the kingdom of the Greeks to the end of them.\r\n\r\nThe prophecy of the seventy weeks, which had hitherto been restricted\r\nto the first coming of our Saviour, is shown to be a prediction of\r\nall the main periods relating to the coming of the Messiah, the times\r\nof his birth and death, the time of his rejection by the Jews, the\r\nduration of the Jewish war by which he caused the city and sanctuary to\r\nbe destroyed, and the time of his second coming.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh chapter Sir Isaac treats with great sagacity and\r\nacuteness of the time of our Saviour’s birth and passion,—a subject\r\nwhich had perplexed all preceding commentators.\r\n\r\nAfter explaining in the twelfth chapter the last prophecy of Daniel,\r\nnamely, that of the scripture of truth, which he considers as a\r\ncommentary on the vision of the ram and he-goat, he proceeds in the\r\nthirteenth chapter to the prophecy of the king who did according to his\r\nwill, and magnified himself above every god, and honoured Mahuzzims,\r\nand regarded not the desire of women. He shows that the Greek empire,\r\nafter the division of the Roman empire into the Greek and Latin\r\nempires, became the king who in matters of religion did according to\r\nhis will, and in legislation exalted and magnified himself above every\r\ngod.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of his work on the Apocalypse of St. John, Sir Isaac\r\ntreats, _1st_, Of the time when the prophecy was written, which he\r\nconceives to have been during John’s exile in Patmos, and before the\r\nepistle to the Hebrews and the epistles of Peter were written, which in\r\nhis opinion have a reference to the Apocalypse; _2dly_, Of the scene of\r\nthe vision, and the relation which the Apocalypse has to the book of\r\nthe law of Moses, and to the worship of God in the temple; and, _3dly_,\r\nOf the relation which the Apocalypse has to the prophecies of Daniel,\r\nand of the subject of the prophecy itself.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac regards the prophecies of the Old and New Testaments, not\r\nas given to gratify men’s curiosities, by enabling them to foreknow\r\nthings, but that after they were fulfilled, they might be interpreted\r\nby the event, and afford convincing arguments that the world is\r\ngoverned by Providence, he considers that there is so much of this\r\nprophecy already fulfilled as to afford to the diligent student\r\nsufficient instances of God’s providence; and he adds, that “among the\r\ninterpreters of the last age, there is scarce one of note who hath not\r\nmade some discovery worth knowing, and thence it seems one may gather\r\nthat God is about opening these mysteries. The success of others,” he\r\ncontinues, “put me upon considering it, and if I have done any thing\r\nwhich may be useful to following writers, I have my design.”\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief abstract of this ingenious work, which is characterized\r\nby great learning, and marked with the sagacity of its distinguished\r\nauthor. The same qualities of his mind are equally conspicuous in his\r\n_Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture_.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated treatise relates to two texts in the Epistles of St.\r\nJohn and St. Paul. The first of these is in 1 John v. 7. “For there\r\nare three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Son, and the\r\nHoly Ghost, and these three are one.” This text he considers as a\r\ngross corruption of Scripture, which had its origin among the Latins,\r\nwho interpreted the Spirit, Water, and Blood to be the Father, Son,\r\nand Holy Ghost, in order to prove them one. With the same view Jerome\r\ninserted the Trinity in express words in his version. The Latins marked\r\nhis variations in the margins of their books; and in the twelfth\r\nand following centuries, when the disputations of the schoolmen\r\nwere at their height, the variation began to creep into the text in\r\ntranscribing. After the invention of printing, it crept out of the\r\nLatin into the printed Greek, contrary to the authority of all the\r\nGreek manuscripts and ancient versions; and from the Venetian press it\r\nwent soon after into Greece. After proving these positions Sir Isaac\r\ngives the following paraphrase of this remarkable passage, which is\r\ngiven in italics.\r\n\r\n“_Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that\r\nJesus is the Son of God_, that Son spoken of in the Psalms, where\r\nhe saith, ‘thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.’ _This\r\nis he that_, after the Jews had long expected him, came, first in a\r\nmortal body, _by_ baptism of _water_, and then in an immortal one, by\r\nshedding his _blood_ upon the cross and rising again from the dead;\r\n_not by water only, but by water and blood_; being the Son of God,\r\nas well by his resurrection from the dead (Acts xiii. 33), as by his\r\nsupernatural birth of the virgin (Luke i. 35). _And it is the Spirit_\r\nalso _that_, together with the water and blood, _beareth witness_ of\r\nthe truth of his coming; _because the Spirit is truth_; and so a fit\r\nand unexceptionable witness. _For there are three that bear record_\r\nof his coming; _the Spirit_, which he promised to send, and which was\r\nsince shed forth upon us in the form of cloven tongues, and in various\r\ngifts; _the_ baptism of _water_, wherein God testified ‘this is my\r\nbeloved Son;’ _and the_ shedding of his _blood_, accompanied with his\r\nresurrection, whereby he became the most faithful martyr, or witness,\r\nof this truth. _And these three_, the spirit, the baptism, and passion\r\nof Christ, _agree in_ witnessing _one_ and the same thing (namely, that\r\nthe Son of God is come); and, therefore, their evidence is strong:\r\nfor the law requires but two consenting witnesses, and here we have\r\nthree: _and if we receive the witness of men, the_ threefold _witness\r\nof God_, which he bare of his Son, by declaring at his baptism ‘this is\r\nmy beloved Son,’ by raising him from the dead, and by pouring out his\r\nSpirit on us, _is greater_; and, therefore, ought to be more readily\r\nreceived.”\r\n\r\nWhile the Latin Church was corrupting the preceding text, the Greek\r\nChurch was doing the same to St. Paul’s 1st Epistle to Timothy iii.\r\n16. _Great is the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh._\r\nAccording to Sir Isaac, this reading was effected by changing σ into\r\nΘΣ, the abbreviation of Θεος, and after proving this by a learned and\r\ningenious examination of ancient manuscripts, he concludes that the\r\nreading should be _Great is the mystery of Godliness who_ (viz. our\r\nSaviour) _was manifest in the flesh_.\r\n\r\nAs this learned dissertation had the effect of depriving the defenders\r\nof the doctrine of the Trinity of the aid of two leading texts, Sir\r\nIsaac Newton has been regarded as an Antitrinitarian; but such a\r\nconclusion is not warranted by any thing which he has published;[105]\r\nand he distinctly warns us, that his object was solely to “purge the\r\ntruth of things spurious.” We are disposed, on the contrary, to think\r\nthat he declares his belief in the doctrine of the Trinity when he\r\nsays, “In the eastern nations, and for a long time in the western,\r\nthe _faith_ subsisted without this text; and it is rather a danger to\r\nreligion than an advantage, to make _it now_ lean upon a bruised reed.\r\nThere cannot be better service done to the truth than to purge it of\r\nthings spurious; and therefore, knowing your prudence and calmness\r\nof temper, I am confident I shall not offend you by telling you my\r\nmind plainly; especially since it is no article of faith, no point of\r\ndiscipline, nothing but a criticism concerning a text of Scripture\r\nwhich I am going to write about.” The word faith in the preceding\r\npassage cannot mean faith in the Scriptures in general, but faith in\r\nthe particular doctrine of the Trinity; for it is this article of\r\nfaith only to which the author refers when he deprecates _its_ leaning\r\non a bruised reed. But, whatever be the meaning of this passage, we\r\nknow that Sir Isaac was greatly offended at Mr. Whiston for having\r\nrepresented him as an Arian; and so much did he resent the conduct of\r\nhis friend in ascribing to him heretical opinions, that he would not\r\npermit him to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society while he was\r\nPresident.[106]\r\n\r\nThe only other religious works which were composed by Sir Isaac Newton\r\nwere his _Lexicon Propheticum_, to which was added a Dissertation\r\non the sacred cubit of the Jews, and _Four Letters addressed to Dr.\r\nBentley, containing some arguments in proof of a Deity_.\r\n\r\nThe _Lexicon Propheticum_ was left incomplete, and has not been\r\npublished; but the Latin Dissertation which was appended to it, in\r\nwhich he shows that the cubit was about 26½ Roman unciæ, was published\r\nin 1737 among the Miscellaneous Works of Mr. John Greaves.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of the Honourable Robert Boyle, on the 30th of December,\r\n1691, it was found, by a codicil to his will, that he had left a\r\nrevenue of 50_l._ per annum to establish a lectureship, in which eight\r\ndiscourses were to be preached annually in one of the churches of the\r\nmetropolis, in illustration of the evidences of Christianity, and in\r\nopposition to the principles of infidelity. Dr. Bentley, though a very\r\nyoung man, was appointed to preach the first course of sermons, and\r\nthe manner in which he discharged this important duty gave the highest\r\nsatisfaction, not only to the trustees of the lectureship, but to\r\nthe public in general. In the first six lectures Bentley exposed the\r\nfolly of atheism even in reference to the present life, and derived\r\npowerful arguments for the existence of a Deity from the faculties of\r\nthe soul, and the structure and functions of the human frame. In order\r\nto complete his plan, he proposed to devote his seventh and eighth\r\nlectures to the demonstration of a Divine Providence from the physical\r\nconstitution of the universe, as established in the Principia. In\r\norder to qualify himself for this task, he received from Sir Isaac\r\nwritten directions respecting a list of books necessary to be perused\r\nprevious to the study of that work;[107] and having made himself master\r\nof the system which it contained, he applied it with irresistible force\r\nof argument to establish the existence of an overruling mind. Previous\r\nto the publication of these lectures, Bentley encountered a difficulty\r\nwhich he was not able to solve, and he prudently transmitted to Sir\r\nIsaac during 1692 a series of queries on the subject. This difficulty\r\noccurred in an argument urged by Lucretius, to prove the eternity of\r\nthe world from an hypothesis of deriving the frame of it by mechanical\r\nprinciples from matter endowed with an innate power of gravity, and\r\nevenly scattered throughout the heavens. Sir Isaac willingly entered\r\nupon the consideration of the subject, and transmitted his sentiments\r\nto Dr. Bentley in the four letters which have been noticed in a\r\npreceding chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the first[108] of these letters Sir Isaac mentions that when he\r\nwrote his treatise about our system, viz. the Third Book of the\r\nPrincipia, “he had an eye upon such principles as might work, with\r\nconsidering men, for the belief of a Deity, and he expresses his\r\nhappiness that it has been found useful for that purpose. In answering\r\nthe first query of Dr. Bentley, the exact import of which we do not\r\nknow, he states, that, if matter were evenly diffused through a finite\r\nspace, and endowed with innate gravity, it would fall down into the\r\nmiddle of the space, and form one great spherical mass; but if it were\r\ndiffused through an infinite space, some of it would collect into\r\none mass, and some into another, so as to form an infinite number\r\nof great masses. In this manner the sun and stars might be formed if\r\nthe matter were of a lucid nature. But he thinks it inexplicable by\r\nnatural causes, and to be ascribed to the counsel and contrivance\r\nof a voluntary Agent, that the matter should divide itself into two\r\nsorts, part of it composing a shining body like the sun, and part an\r\nopaque body like the planets. Had a natural and blind cause, without\r\ncontrivance and design, placed the earth in the centre of the moon’s\r\norbit, and Jupiter in the centre of his system of satellites, and the\r\nsun in the centre of the planetary system, the sun would have been a\r\nbody like Jupiter and the earth, that is, without light and heat, and\r\nconsequently he knows no reason why there is only one body qualified\r\nto give light and heat to all the rest, but because the Author of the\r\nsystem thought it convenient, and because one was sufficient to warm\r\nand enlighten all the rest.\r\n\r\nTo the second query of Dr. Bentley, he replies that the motions which\r\nthe planets now have could not spring from any natural cause alone, but\r\nwere impressed by an intelligent Agent. “To make such a system with all\r\nits motions required a cause which understood and compared together the\r\nquantities of matter in the several bodies of the sun and planets, and\r\nthe gravitating powers resulting from thence; the several distances\r\nof the primary planets from the sun, and of the secondary ones from\r\nSaturn, Jupiter, and the earth, and the velocities with which those\r\nplanets could revolve about those quantities of matter in the central\r\nbodies; and to compare and adjust all these things together in so great\r\na variety of bodies, argues that cause to be not blind and fortuitous,\r\nbut very well skilled in mechanics and geometry.”\r\n\r\nIn the second[109] letter, he admits that the spherical mass formed by\r\nthe aggregation of particles would affect the figure of the space in\r\nwhich the matter was diffused, provided the matter descends directly\r\ndownwards to that body, and the body has no diurnal rotation; but he\r\nstates, that by earthquakes loosening the parts of this solid, the\r\nprotuberance might sink a little by their weight, and the mass by\r\ndegrees approach a spherical figure. He then proceeds to correct an\r\nerror of Dr. Bentley’s in supposing that all infinites are equal. He\r\nadmits that gravity might put the planets in motion, but he maintains\r\nthat, without the Divine power, it could never give them such a\r\ncirculating motion as they have about the sun, because a proper\r\nquantity of a transverse motion is necessary for this purpose; and he\r\nconcludes that he is compelled to ascribe the frame of this system to\r\nan intelligent Agent.\r\n\r\nThe third letter contains opinions confirming or correcting several\r\npositions which Dr. Bentley had laid down, and he concludes it with a\r\ncurious examination of the opinion of Plato, that the motion of the\r\nplanets is such as if they had been all created by God in some region\r\nvery remote from our system, and let fall from thence towards the\r\nsun, their falling motion being turned aside into a transverse one\r\nwhenever they arrived at their several orbits. Sir Isaac shows that\r\nthere is no common place such as that conjectured by Plato, provided\r\nthe gravitating power of the sun remains constant; but that Plato’s\r\naffirmation is true if we suppose the gravitating power of the sun to\r\nbe doubled at that moment of time when they all arrive at their several\r\norbits. “If we suppose,” says he, “the gravity of all the planets\r\ntowards the sun to be of such a quantity as it really is, and that the\r\nmotions of the planets are turned upwards, every planet will ascend\r\nto twice its height from the sun. Saturn will ascend till he be twice\r\nas high from the sun as he is at present, and no higher; Jupiter will\r\nascend as high again as at present, that is, a little above the orb of\r\nSaturn; Mercury will ascend to twice his present height, that is, to\r\nthe orb of Venus; and so of the rest; and then, by falling down again\r\nfrom the places to which they ascended, they will arise again at their\r\nseveral orbs with the same velocities they had at first, and with which\r\nthey now revolve.\r\n\r\n“But if so soon as their motions by which they revolve are turned\r\nupwards, the gravitating power of the sun, by which their ascent is\r\nperpetually retarded, be diminished by one-half, they will now ascend\r\nperpetually, and all of them, at all equal distances from the sun,\r\nwill be equally swift. Mercury, when he arrives at the orb of Venus,\r\nwill be as swift as Venus; and he and Venus, when they arrive at the\r\norb of the earth, will be as swift as the earth; and so of the rest.\r\nIf they begin all of them to ascend at once, and ascend in the same\r\nline, they will constantly, in ascending, become nearer and nearer\r\ntogether, and their motions will constantly approach to an equality,\r\nand become at length slower than any motion assignable. Suppose,\r\ntherefore, that they ascended till they were almost contiguous, and\r\ntheir motions inconsiderably little, and that all their motions were\r\nat the same moment of time turned back again, or, which comes almost\r\nto the same thing, that they were only deprived of their motions, and\r\nlet fall at that time, they would all at once arrive at their several\r\norbs, each with the velocity it had at first; and if their motions were\r\nthen turned sideways, and at the same time the gravitating power of the\r\nsun doubled, that it might be strong enough to retain them in their\r\norbs, they would revolve in them as before their ascent. But if the\r\ngravitating power of the sun was not doubled, they would go away from\r\ntheir orbs into the highest heavens in parabolical lines.”[110]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth letter[111] he states, that the hypothesis that\r\nmatter is at first evenly diffused through the universe is in his\r\nopinion inconsistent with the hypothesis of innate gravity without a\r\nsupernatural power to reconcile them, and therefore it infers a Deity.\r\n“For if there be innate gravity, it is impossible now for the matter of\r\nthe earth and all the planets and stars to fly up from them, and become\r\nevenly spread throughout all the heavens without a supernatural power;\r\nand certainly that which can never be hereafter without a supernatural\r\npower, could never be heretofore without the same power.”\r\n\r\nThese letters, of which we have endeavoured to give a brief summary,\r\nwill well repay the most attentive perusal by the philosopher as well\r\nas the divine. They are written with much perspicuity of language and\r\ngreat power of thought, and they contain results which incontestably\r\nprove that their author was fully master of his noblest faculties, and\r\ncomprehended the profoundest parts of his own writings.[112]\r\n\r\nThe logical acuteness, the varied erudition, and the absolute freedom\r\nfrom all prejudice which shine throughout the theological writings\r\nof Newton, might have protected them from the charge of having been\r\nwritten in his old age, and at a time when a failure of mind was\r\nsupposed to have unfitted him for his mathematical investigations. But\r\nit is fortunate for his reputation, as well as for the interests of\r\nChristianity, that we have been able to prove the incorrectness of such\r\ninsinuations, and to exhibit the most irrefragable evidence that _all\r\nthe theological writings_ of Newton were composed in the vigour of his\r\nlife, and before the crisis of that bodily disorder which is supposed\r\nto have affected his reason. The able letters to Dr. Bentley were even\r\nwritten in the middle of that period when want of sleep and appetite\r\nhad disturbed the serenity of his mind, and enable us to prove that\r\nthis disturbance, whatever was its amount, never affected the higher\r\nfunctions of his understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen a philosopher of distinguished eminence, and we believe not\r\ninimical to the Christian faith, has found it necessary to make a\r\nlaboured apology for a man like Newton writing on theological subjects,\r\nand has been led to render that apology more complete by referring this\r\nclass of his labours to a mind debilitated by age and weakened by its\r\nprevious aberrations, it may be expected from an English biographer,\r\nand one who acknowledges the importance of revealed truth, and the\r\nparamount interest of such subjects above all secular studies, to\r\nsuggest the true origin of Newton’s theological inquiries.\r\n\r\nWhen a mind of great and acknowledged power first directs its energies\r\nto the study of the material universe, no indications of order attract\r\nhis notice, and no proofs of design call forth his admiration. In the\r\nstarry firmament he sees no bodies of stupendous magnitude, and no\r\ndistances of immeasurable span. The two great luminaries appear vastly\r\ninferior in magnitude to many objects around him, and the greatest\r\ndistances in the heavens seem even inferior to those which his own eye\r\ncan embrace on the surface of the earth. The planets, when observed\r\nwith care, are seen to have a motion among the fixed stars, and to vary\r\nin their magnitude and distances, but these changes appear to follow no\r\nlaw. Sometimes they move to the east, sometimes to the west, sometimes\r\ntowards the north, and sometimes towards the south, and at other\r\ntimes they are absolutely stationary. No system, in short, appears,\r\nand no general law seems to direct their motions. By the observations\r\nand inquiries of astronomers, however, during successive ages, a\r\nregular system has been recognised in this chaos of moving bodies,\r\nand the magnitudes, distances, and revolutions of every planet which\r\ncomposes it has been determined with the most extraordinary accuracy.\r\nMinds fitted and prepared for this species of inquiry are capable of\r\nunderstanding the great variety of evidence by which the truth of the\r\nplanetary system is established; but thousands of individuals who are\r\neven distinguished in other branches of knowledge are incapable of such\r\nresearches, and view with a skeptical eye the great and irrefragable\r\ntruths of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThat the sun is stationary in the centre of our system,—that the\r\nearth moves round the sun, and round its own axis,—that the earth is\r\n8000 miles in diameter, and the sun _one hundred and ten_ times as\r\nlarge,—that the earth’s orbit is 190 millions of miles in breadth,—and\r\nthat if this immense space were filled with light, it would appear\r\nonly like a luminous point at the nearest fixed star,—are positions\r\nabsolutely unintelligible and incredible to all who have not carefully\r\nstudied the subject. To millions of our species, then, the great book\r\nof nature is absolutely sealed, though it is in the power of all to\r\nunfold its pages, and to peruse those glowing passages which proclaim\r\nthe power and wisdom of its mighty Author.\r\n\r\nThe book of revelation exhibits to us the same peculiarities as that\r\nof nature. To the ordinary eye it presents no immediate indications\r\nof its Divine origin. Events apparently insignificant—supernatural\r\ninterferences seemingly unnecessary—doctrines almost contradictory—and\r\nprophecies nearly unintelligible occupy its pages. The history of\r\nthe fall of man—of the introduction of moral and physical evil—the\r\nprediction of a Messiah—the actual advent of our Saviour—his\r\ninstructions—his miracles—his death—his resurrection—and the subsequent\r\npropagation of his religion by the unlettered fishermen of Galilee,\r\nare each a stumbling block to the wisdom of this world. The youthful\r\nand vigorous mind, when first summoned to peruse the Scriptures, turns\r\nfrom them with disappointment. It recognises in them no profound\r\nscience—no secular wisdom—no Divine eloquence—no disclosures of\r\nnature’s secrets—no direct impress of an Almighty hand. But, though\r\nthe system of revealed truth which this book contains is, like that of\r\nthe universe, concealed from common observation, yet the labours of\r\ncenturies have established its Divine origin, and developed in all its\r\norder and beauty the great plan of human restoration. In the chaos of\r\nits incidents we discover the whole history of our species, whether it\r\nis delineated in events that are past or shadowed forth in those which\r\nare to come,—from the creation of man and the origin of evil, to the\r\nextinction of his earthly dynasty and the commencement of his immortal\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity and authenticity of the books which compose the sacred\r\ncanon,—the fulfilment of its prophecies,—the miraculous works of its\r\nfounder,—his death and resurrection, have been demonstrated to all who\r\nare capable of appreciating the force of historical evidence; and in\r\nthe poetical and prose compositions of the inspired authors we discover\r\na system of doctrine and a code of morality traced in characters as\r\ndistinct and legible as the most unerring truths in the material world.\r\nFalse systems of religion have indeed been deduced from the sacred\r\nrecord,—as false systems of the universe have sprung from the study of\r\nthe book of nature,—but the very prevalence of a false system proves\r\nthe existence of one that is true; and though the two classes of facts\r\nnecessarily depend on different kinds of evidence, yet we scruple\r\nnot to say that the Copernican system is not more demonstrably true\r\nthan the system of theological truth contained in the Bible. If men of\r\nhigh powers, then, are still found, who are insensible to the evidence\r\nwhich sustains the system of the universe, need we wonder that there\r\nare others whose minds are shut against the effulgent evidence which\r\nintrenches the strongholds of our faith.\r\n\r\nIf such, then, is the character of the Christian faith, we need not\r\nbe surprised that it was embraced and expounded by such a genius\r\nas Sir Isaac Newton. Cherishing its doctrines, and leaning on its\r\npromises, he felt it his duty, as it was his pleasure, to apply to\r\nit that intellectual strength which had successfully surmounted the\r\ndifficulties of the material universe. The fame which that success\r\nprocured him he could not but feel to be the breath of popular\r\napplause, which administered only to his personal feelings; but the\r\ninvestigation of the sacred mysteries, while it prepared his own\r\nmind for its final destiny, was calculated to promote the spiritual\r\ninterests of thousands. This noble impulse he did not hesitate to obey,\r\nand by thus uniting philosophy with religion, he dissolved the league\r\nwhich genius had formed with skepticism, and added to the cloud of\r\nwitnesses the brightest name of ancient or of modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  _The minor Discoveries and Inventions of Newton—His Researches on\r\n    Heat—On Fire and Flame—On Elective Attraction—On the Structure of\r\n    Bodies—His supposed Attachment to Alchymy—His Hypothesis respecting\r\n    Ether as the Cause of Light and Gravity—On the Excitation of\r\n    Electricity in Glass—His Reflecting Sextant invented before 1700—\r\n    His Reflecting Microscope—His Prismatic Reflector as a Substitute\r\n    for the small Speculum of Reflecting Telescopes—His Method of\r\n    varying the Magnifying Power of Newtonian Telescopes—His Experiments\r\n    on Impressions on the Retina._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have given an account of the principal\r\nlabours of Sir Isaac Newton; but there still remain to be noticed\r\nseveral of his minor discoveries and inventions, which could not\r\nproperly be introduced under any general head.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these, perhaps, are his chymical researches,\r\nwhich he seems to have pursued with more or less diligence from the\r\ntime when he first witnessed the practical operations of chymistry\r\nduring his residence at the apothecary’s at Grantham. His first\r\nchymical experiments were probably made on the alloys of metals, for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining a good metallic composition for the specula\r\nof reflecting telescopes. In his paper on thin plates he treats of the\r\ncombinations of solids and fluids; but he enters more largely on these\r\nand other subjects in the queries published at the end of his Optics.\r\n\r\nOne of his most important chymical papers is his _Tabula quantitatum\r\net graduum caloris_, which was published in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions. This short paper contains a comparative scale of\r\ntemperature from that of melting ice to that of a small kitchen\r\ncoal-fire. The following are the principal points of the scale, the\r\nintermediate degrees of heat having been determined with great care.\r\n\r\n    Degrees   Equal Parts\r\n    of Heat.    of Heat.\r\n       0           0      Freezing point of water.\r\n       1          12      Blood-heat.\r\n       2          24      Heat of melting wax.\r\n       3          48      Melting point of equal parts of tin and\r\n                              bismuth.\r\n       4          96      Melting point of lead.\r\n       5         192      Heat of a small coal-fire.\r\n\r\nThe first column of this table contains the degrees of heat\r\nin arithmetical progression, and the second in geometrical\r\nprogression,—the second degree being twice as great as the first, and\r\nso on. It is obvious from this table, that the heat at which equal\r\nparts of tin and bismuth melt is _four_ times greater than that of\r\nblood-heat, the heat of melting lead _eight_ times greater, and the\r\nheat of a small coal-fire _sixteen_ times greater.\r\n\r\nThis table was constructed by the help of a thermometer, and of red-hot\r\niron. By the former he measured all heats as far as that of melting\r\ntin; and by the latter he measured all the higher heats. For the heat\r\nwhich heated iron loses in a given time is as the total heat of the\r\niron; and therefore, if the times of cooling are taken equal, the heats\r\nwill be in a geometrical progression, and may therefore be easily found\r\nby a table of logarithms.\r\n\r\nHe found by a thermometer constructed with linseed oil, that if the\r\noil, when the thermometer was placed in melting snow, occupied a space\r\nof 1000 parts, the same oil, rarefied with _one_ degree of heat, or\r\nthat of the human body, occupied a space of 10256; in the heat of water\r\nbeginning to boil, a space of 10705; in the heat of water boiling\r\nviolently, 10725; in the heat of melted tin beginning to cool, and\r\nputting on the consistency of an amalgam, 11516, and when the tin had\r\nbecome solid, 11496. Hence the oil was rarefied in the ratio of 40 to\r\n39 by the heat of the human body; of 15 to 14 by the heat of boiling\r\nwater; of 15 to 13 in the heat of melting tin beginning to solidify;\r\nand of 23 to 20 in the same tin when solid. The rarefaction of air\r\nwas, with the same heat, _ten_ times greater than that of oil, and\r\nthe rarefaction of oil _fifteen_ times greater than that of spirit of\r\nwine. By making the heats of oil proportional to its rarefaction, and\r\nby calling the heat of the human body 12 parts, we obtain the heat of\r\nwater beginning to boil, 33; of water boiling violently, 34; of melted\r\ntin beginning to solidify, 72; and of the same become solid, 70.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac then heated a sufficiently thick piece of iron till it was\r\nred-hot; and having fixed it in a cold place, where the wind blew\r\nuniformly, he put upon it small pieces of different metals and other\r\nfusible bodies, and noted the times of cooling, till all the particles,\r\nhaving lost their fluidity, grew cold, and the heat of the iron was\r\nequal to that of the human body. Then, by assuming that the excesses of\r\nthe heats of the iron and of the solidified particles of metal above\r\nthe heat of the atmosphere, were in geometrical progression when the\r\ntimes were in arithmetical progression, all the heats were obtained.\r\nThe iron was placed in a current of air, in order that the air heated\r\nby the iron might always be carried away by the wind, and that cold air\r\nmight replace it with a uniform motion; for thus equal parts of the\r\nair were heated in equal times, and received a heat proportional to\r\nthat of the iron. But the heats thus found had the same ratio to one\r\nanother with the heats found by the thermometer; and hence he was right\r\nin assuming that the rarefactions of the oil were proportional to its\r\nheats.\r\n\r\nAnother short chymical paper by Sir Isaac Newton has been published by\r\nDr. Horsley. It is entitled _De Natura Acidorum_, but is principally\r\noccupied with a number of brief opinions on chymical subjects. This\r\npaper was written later than 1687, as it bears a reference to the\r\nPrincipia; and the most important facts which it contains seem to have\r\nbeen more distinctly reproduced in the queries at the end of the Optics.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these queries relate to fire, flame, and electric\r\nattractions, and as they were revised in the year 1716 and 1717, they\r\nmay be regarded as containing the most matured opinions of their\r\nauthor. Fire he regards as a body heated so hot as to emit light\r\ncopiously, and flame as a vapour, fume, or exhalation heated so hot\r\nas to shine. In his long query on elective attractions, he considers\r\nthe small particles of bodies as acting upon one another at distances\r\nso minute as to escape observation. When salt of tartar deliquesces,\r\nhe supposes that this arises from an attraction between the saline\r\nparticles and the aqueous particles held in solution in the atmosphere,\r\nand to the same attraction he ascribes it that the water will not\r\ndistil from the salt of tartar without great heat. For the same reason\r\nsulphuric acid attracts water powerfully, and parts with it with great\r\ndifficulty. When this attractive force becomes very powerful, as in the\r\nunion between sulphuric acid and water, so as to make the particles\r\n“coalesce with violence,” and rush towards one another with an\r\naccelerated motion, heat is produced by the mixture of the two fluids.\r\nIn like manner, he explains the production of flame from the mixture\r\nof cold fluids,—the action of fulminating powders,—the combination of\r\niron filings with sulphur,—and all the other chymical phenomena of\r\nprecipitation, combination, solution, and crystallization, and the\r\nmechanical phenomena of cohesion and capillary attraction. He ascribes\r\nhot springs, volcanoes, fire-damps, mineral coruscations, earthquakes,\r\nhot suffocating exhalations, hurricanes, lightning, thunder, fiery\r\nmeteors, subterraneous explosions, land-slips, ebullitions of the sea,\r\nand waterspouts, to sulphureous steams abounding in the bowels of the\r\nearth, and fermenting with minerals, or escaping into the atmosphere,\r\nwhere they ferment with acid vapours fitted to promote fermentation.\r\n\r\nIn explaining the structure of solid bodies, he is of opinion,\r\n“that the smallest particles of matter may cohere by the strongest\r\nattractions, and compose bigger particles of weaker virtue; and many\r\nof these may cohere and compose bigger particles whose virtue is still\r\nweaker; and so on for divers successions, until the progression end\r\nin the biggest particles, on which the operations in chymistry and\r\nthe colours of natural bodies depend, and which, by adhering, compose\r\nbodies of a sensible magnitude. If the body is compact, and bends or\r\nyields inward to pression, without any sliding of its parts, it is\r\nhard and elastic, returning to its figure with a force rising from the\r\nmutual attraction of its parts. If the parts slide upon one another,\r\nthe body is malleable or soft. If they slip easily, and are of a fit\r\nsize to be agitated by heat, and the heat is big enough to keep them\r\nin agitation, the body is fluid; and if it be apt to stick to things,\r\nit is humid; and the drops of every fluid affect a round figure, by\r\nthe mutual attraction of their parts, as the globe of the earth and\r\nsea affects a round figure, by the mutual attraction of its parts, by\r\ngravity.”\r\n\r\nSir Isaac then supposes, that, as the attractive force of bodies can\r\nreach but to a small distance from them, “a repulsive virtue ought\r\nto succeed;” and he considers such a virtue as following from the\r\nreflection of the rays of light, the rays being repelled without the\r\nimmediate contact of the reflecting body, and also from the emission of\r\nlight, the ray, as soon as it is shaken off from a shining body by the\r\nvibrating motion of the parts of the body, getting beyond the reach of\r\nattraction, and being driven away with exceeding great velocity by the\r\nforce of reflection.[113]\r\n\r\nMany of the chymical views which Sir Isaac thus published in the form\r\nof queries were in his own lifetime illustrated and confirmed by Dr.\r\nStephen Hales, in his book on _Vegetable Statics_,—a work of great\r\noriginality, which contains the germ of some of the finest discoveries\r\nin modern chymistry.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no reason to suppose that Sir Isaac Newton was\r\na believer in the doctrines of alchymy, yet we are informed by\r\nthe Reverend Mr. Law that he had been a diligent student of Jacob\r\nBehmen’s writings, and that there were found among his papers copious\r\nabstracts from them in his own handwriting.[114] He states also that\r\nSir Isaac, together with one Dr. Newton, his relation, had, in the\r\nearlier part of his life, set up furnaces, and were for several months\r\nat work in quest of the philosopher’s tincture. These statements may\r\nreceive some confirmation from the fact, that there exist among the\r\nPortsmouth papers many sheets, in Sir Isaac’s own writing, of Flammel’s\r\nExplication of Hieroglyphic Figures, and in another hand, many sheets\r\nof William Yworth’s _Processus Mysterii Magni Philosophicus_, and also\r\nfrom the manner in which Sir Isaac requests Mr. Aston to inquire after\r\none Borry in Holland, who always went clothed in green, and who was\r\nsaid to possess valuable secrets; but Mr. Law has weakened the force of\r\nhis own testimony, when he asserts that Newton borrowed the doctrine\r\nof attraction from Behmen’s first three propositions of eternal nature.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th December, 1675, Sir Isaac Newton communicated to the\r\nRoyal Society a paper entitled _An hypothesis explaining properties\r\nof light_, in which he, for the first time, introduces his opinions\r\nrespecting ether, and employs them to explain the nature of light, and\r\nthe cause of gravity. “He was induced,” he says, “to do this, because\r\nhe had observed the heads of some great virtuosos to run much upon\r\nhypotheses, and he therefore gave one which he was inclined to consider\r\nas the most probable, if he were obliged to adopt one.”[115]\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis seems to have been afterward a subject of discussion\r\nbetween him and Mr. Boyle, to whom he promised to communicate his\r\nopinion more fully in writing. He accordingly addressed to him a long\r\nletter, dated February 28th, 1678–9, in which he explains his views\r\nrespecting ether, and employs them to account for the refraction of\r\nlight,—the cohesion of two polished pieces of metal in an exhausted\r\nreceiver,—the adhesion of quicksilver to glass tubes,—the cohesion\r\nof the parts of all bodies,—the cause of filtration,—the phenomena\r\nof capillary attraction,—the action of menstrua on bodies,—the\r\ntransmutation of gross compact substances into aerial ones,—and the\r\ncause of gravity. From the language used in this paper, we should\r\nbe led to suppose that Sir Isaac had entirely forgotten that he had\r\nformerly treated the general subject of ether, and applied it to the\r\nexplanation of gravity. “I shall set down,” says he, “one conjecture\r\nmore _which came into my mind now as I was writing this letter; it is\r\nabout the cause of gravity,_” which he goes on to explain;[116] and\r\nhe concludes by saying, that “he has so little fancy to things of this\r\nnature, that, _had not your encouragement moved me to it_, I should\r\nnever, I think, thus far have set pen to paper about them.”\r\n\r\nThese opinions, however, about the existence of ether, Newton seems to\r\nhave subsequently renounced; for in the manuscript in the possession\r\nof Dr. J. C. Gregory, which we have already mentioned, and which was\r\nwritten previous to 1702, he states, that ether is neither obvious\r\nto our senses, nor supported by any arguments, but is a gratuitous\r\nassumption, which, if we are to trust to reason and to our senses, must\r\nbe banished from the nature of things; and he goes on to establish,\r\nby various arguments, the validity of this opinion. This renunciation\r\nof his former hypothesis probably arose from his having examined more\r\ncarefully some of the phenomena which he endeavoured to explain by it.\r\nThose of capillary attraction, for example, he had ascribed to the\r\nether “standing rarer in the very sensible cavities of the capillary\r\ntubes than without them,” whereas he afterward discovered their true\r\ncause, and ascribed them to the reciprocal attraction of the tube and\r\nthe fluid. But, however this may be, there can be no doubt that he\r\nresumed his early opinions before the publication of his Optics, which\r\nmay be considered as containing his views upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe queries which contain these opinions are the 18th–24th, all of\r\nwhich appeared for the first time in the second English edition of the\r\nOptics. If a body is either heated or loses its heat when placed in\r\nvacuo, he ascribes the conveyance of the heat in both cases “to the\r\nvibration of a much subtiler medium than air;” and he considers this\r\nmedium as the same with that by which light is refracted and reflected,\r\nand by whose vibrations light communicates heat to bodies, and is put\r\ninto fits of easy reflection and transmission.\r\n\r\nThis ethereal medium, according to our author, is exceedingly more rare\r\nand more elastic than air. It pervades all bodies, and is expanded\r\nthrough all the heavens. It is much rarer within the dense bodies of\r\nthe sun, stars, planets, and comets, than in the celestial spaces\r\nbetween them, and also more rare within glass, water, &c. than in the\r\nfree and open spaces void of air and other grosser bodies. In passing\r\nout of glass, water, &c. and other dense bodies into empty space, it\r\ngrows denser and denser by degrees, and this gradual condensation\r\nextends to some distance from the bodies. Owing to its great\r\nelasticity, and, consequently, its efforts to spread in all directions,\r\nit presses against itself, and, consequently, against the solid\r\nparticles of bodies, so as to make them continually approach to one\r\nanother, the body being impelled from the denser parts of the medium\r\ntowards the rarer with all that power which we call gravity.\r\n\r\nIn employing this medium to explain the nature of light, Newton does\r\nnot suppose, with Descartes, Hooke, Huygens, and others, that light is\r\nnothing more than the impression of those undulations on the retina.\r\nHe regards light as a peculiar substance, composed of heterogeneous\r\nparticles thrown off with great velocity, and in all directions, from\r\nluminous bodies; and he supposes that these particles while passing\r\nthrough the ether, excite in it vibrations or pulses which accelerate\r\nor retard the particles of light, and thus throw them into their\r\nalternate fits of easy reflection and transmission.\r\n\r\nHence, if a ray of light falls upon a transparent body, in which the\r\nether consists of strata of variable density, the particles of light\r\nacted upon by the vibrations which they create will be urged with an\r\naccelerated velocity in entering the body, while their velocity will\r\nbe retarded in quitting it. In this manner he conceives the phenomena\r\nof refraction to be produced, and he shows how in such a case the\r\nrefraction would be regulated by the law of the sines.\r\n\r\nIn order that the ethereal medium may produce the fits of easy\r\nreflection and transmission, he conceives that its vibrations must be\r\nswifter than light. He computes its elasticity to be 490,000,000,000\r\ntimes greater than that of air, in proportion to its density, and about\r\n600,000,000 times more rare than water, from which he infers that the\r\nresistance which it would oppose to the motions of the planets would\r\nnot be sensible in 10,000 years. He considers that the functions of\r\nvision and hearing may be performed chiefly by the vibrations of this\r\nmedium, executed in the bottom of the eye, or in the auditory nerve\r\nby the rays of light, and propagated through the solid, pellucid, and\r\nuniform capillamenta of the optic or auditory nerves into the place of\r\nsensation; and he is of opinion that animal motion may be performed by\r\nthe vibrations of the same medium, excited in the brain by the power\r\nof the will, and propagated from thence by the solid, pellucid, and\r\nuniform capillamenta of the nerves into the muscles for contracting and\r\ndilating them.\r\n\r\nIn the registers of the Royal Society there exist several letters[117]\r\non the excitation of electricity in glass, which were occasioned\r\nby an experiment of this kind having been mentioned in Sir Isaac’s\r\nhypothesis of light. The society had ordered the experiment to be tried\r\nat their meeting of the 16th December, 1675; but, in order to secure\r\nits success, Mr. Oldenburg wrote to Sir Isaac for a more particular\r\naccount of it. Sir Isaac being thus “put upon recollecting himself a\r\nlittle farther about it,” remembers that he made the experiment with a\r\nglass fixed at the distance of the 1/3d of an inch from one end of a\r\nbrass hoop, and only the 1/8th of an inch from the other. Small pieces\r\nof thin paper were then laid upon the table; when the glass was laid\r\nabove them and rubbed, the pieces of paper leaped from the one part of\r\nthe glass to the other, and twirled about in the air. Notwithstanding\r\nthis explicit account of the experiment, it entirely failed at the\r\nRoyal Society, and the secretary was desired to request the loan of\r\nSir Isaac’s apparatus, and to inquire whether or not he had secured\r\nthe papers from being moved by the air, which might have somewhere\r\nstole in. In a letter, dated 21st December, Sir Isaac recommended to\r\nthe society to rub the glass “with stuff whose threads may rake its\r\nsurface, and, if that will not do, to rub it with the fingers’ ends\r\nto and fro, and knock them as often upon the glass.” These directions\r\nenabled the society to succeed with the experiment on the 13th January,\r\n1676, when they used a scrubbing brush of short hog’s bristles, and the\r\nheft of a knife made with whalebone.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor inventions of Sir Isaac Newton, we must enumerate\r\nhis reflecting instrument for observing the moon’s distance from\r\nthe fixed stars at sea. The description of this instrument was\r\ncommunicated to Dr. Halley in the year 1700; but, either from having\r\nmislaid the manuscript, or from attaching no value to the invention,\r\nhe never communicated it to the Royal Society, and it remained among\r\nhis papers till after his death in 1742, when it was published in\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions. The following is Sir Isaac’s own\r\ndescription of it as communicated to Dr. Halley.\r\n\r\n“In the annexed figure PQRS denotes a plate of brass, accurately\r\ndivided in the limb DQ, into ½ degrees, ½ minutes, and 1/12 minutes, by\r\na diagonal scale; and the ½ degrees, and ½ minutes, and 1/12 minutes,\r\ncounted for degrees, minutes, and 1/6 minutes. AB is a telescope three\r\nor four feet long, fixed on the edge of that brass plate. G is a\r\nspeculum fixed on the brass plate perpendicularly as near as may be\r\nto the object-glass of the telescope, so as to be inclined forty-five\r\ndegrees to the axis of the telescope, and intercept half the light\r\nwhich would otherwise come through the telescope to the eye. CD is a\r\nmoveable index turning about the centre C, and, with its fiducial edge,\r\nshowing the degrees, minutes, and 1/6 minutes on the limb of the brass\r\nplate PQ; the centre C must be over against the middle of the speculum\r\nG. H is another speculum, parallel to the former, when the fiducial\r\nedge of index falls on 0° 0′ 0″; so that the same star may then appear\r\nthrough the telescope in one and the same place, both by the direct\r\nrays and by the reflexed ones; but if the index be turned, the star\r\nshall appear in two places, whose distance is showed on the brass limb\r\nby the index.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 12._]\r\n\r\n“By this instrument the distance of the moon from any fixed star is\r\nthus observed: view the star through the perspicil by the direct\r\nlight, and the moon by the reflexed (or on the contrary); and turn the\r\nindex till the star touch the limb of the moon, and the index shall\r\nshow on the brass limb of the instrument the distance of the star from\r\nthe moon’s limb; and though the instrument shake by the motion of the\r\nship at sea, yet the moon and star will move together as if they did\r\nreally touch one another in the heavens; so that an observation may be\r\nmade as exactly at sea as at land.\r\n\r\n“And by the same instrument may be observed exactly the altitudes of\r\nthe moon and stars, by bringing them to the horizon; and thereby the\r\nlatitude and times of observation may be determined more exactly than\r\nby the ways now in use.\r\n\r\n“In the time of the observation, if the instrument move angularly about\r\nthe axis of the telescope, the star will move in a tangent of the\r\nmoon’s limb, or of the horizon; but the observation may notwithstanding\r\nbe made exactly, by noting when the line described by the star is a\r\ntangent to the moon’s limb, or to the horizon.\r\n\r\n“To make the instrument useful, the telescope ought to take in a large\r\nangle; and to make the observation true, let the star touch the moon’s\r\nlimb, not on the outside, but on the inside.”\r\n\r\nThis ingenious contrivance is obviously the very same invention as\r\nthat which Mr. Hadley produced in 1731, and which, under the name of\r\nHadley’s Quadrant, has been of so great service in navigation. The\r\nmerit of its first invention must therefore be transferred to Sir Isaac\r\nNewton.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1672, Sir Isaac communicated to Mr. Oldenburg his design\r\nfor a microscope, which he considered to be as capable of improvement\r\nas the telescope, and perhaps more so, because it requires only one\r\nspeculum. This microscope is shown in the annexed diagram, where AB is\r\nthe object-metal, CD the eye-glass, F their common focus, and O the\r\nother focus of the metal in which the object is placed. This ingenious\r\nidea has been greatly improved in modern times by Professor Amici, who\r\nmakes AB a portion of an ellipsoid, whose foci are O and F, and who\r\nplaces a small plain speculum between O and AB, in order to reflect\r\nthe object, which is placed on one side AP, for the purpose of being\r\nilluminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 13._]\r\n\r\nIn another letter to Mr. Oldenburg, dated July 11th in the same year,\r\nhe suggests another improvement in microscopes, which is to “illuminate\r\nthe object in a darkened room with the light of any convenient colour\r\nnot too much compounded: for by that means the microscope will, with\r\ndistinctness, bear a deeper charge and larger aperture, especially\r\nif its construction be such as I may hereafter describe.”[118]\r\nThis happy idea I have some years ago succeeded in realizing, by\r\nilluminating microscopic objects with the light of a monochromatic\r\nlamp, which discharges a copious flame of pure yellow light of definite\r\nrefrangibility.[119]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 14._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 15._]\r\n\r\nIn order to remedy the evils arising from the weak reflecting power of\r\nspeculum metal, and from its tarnishing by exposure to the air, Sir\r\nIsaac proposed to substitute for the small oval speculum a triangular\r\nprism of glass or crystal ABC. Its side AB _ba_ he supposes to perform\r\nthe office of that metal, by reflecting towards the eye-glass the light\r\nwhich comes from the concave speculum DF, _fig. 13_, whose light he\r\nsupposes to enter into this prism at its side CB _bc_, and lest any\r\ncolours should be produced by the refraction of these planes, it is\r\nrequisite that the angles of the prism at A_a_ and B_b_ be precisely\r\nequal. This may be done most conveniently, by making them half right\r\nangles, and consequently the third angle at C_c_ a right one. The plane\r\nAB _ba_ will reflect all the light incident upon it; but in order to\r\nexclude unnecessary light, it will be proper to cover it all over with\r\nsome black substance excepting two circular spaces of the planes A_c_\r\nand B_c_, through which the useful light may pass. The length of the\r\nprism should be such that its sides A_c_ and B_c_ may be square, and\r\nso much of the angles B and _b_ as are superfluous ought to be ground\r\noff, to give passage for as much light as is possible from the object\r\nto the speculum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 16._]\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of this prism, which cannot be obtained from the\r\noval metal, is, that without using two glasses the object may be\r\nerected, and the magnifying power of the telescope varied at pleasure,\r\nby merely varying the distances of the speculum, the prism, and the\r\neye-glass. This will be understood from _fig. 16_, where AI represents\r\nthe great concave speculum, EF the eye-glass, and BCD the prism of\r\nglass, whose sides BC and CD are not flat, but spherically convex. The\r\nrays which come from G, the focus of the great speculum AI, will, by\r\nthe refraction of the first side BC, be reduced to parallelism, and\r\nafter reflection from the base CD, will be made by the refraction of\r\nthe next side BD to converge to the focus H of the eye-glass EF. If we\r\nnow bring the prism BCD nearer the image at G, the point H will recede\r\nfrom BD, and the image formed there will be greater than that at G, and\r\nif we remove the prism BCD from G, the point H will approach to BD, and\r\nthe image at H will be less than that at G. The prism BCD performs the\r\nsame part as a convex lens, G and H being its conjugate foci, and the\r\nrelative size of the images formed at these points being proportional\r\nto their distance from the lens. This construction would be a good one\r\nfor varying optically the angular distance of a pair of wires placed in\r\nthe focus of the eye-glass EF; and by bisecting the lenticular prism\r\nBCD, and giving the halves a slight inclination, we should be able\r\nto separate and to close the two images or disks which would thus be\r\nproduced, and thus form a double image micrometer.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor and detached labours of Sir Isaac, we must not omit his\r\ncurious experiments on the action of light upon the retina. Locke seems\r\nto have wished his opinion respecting a fact stated in Boyle’s Book\r\non Colours, and in a letter from Cambridge, dated June 30th, 1691, he\r\ncommunicated to his friend the following very remarkable observations\r\nmade by himself.\r\n\r\n“The observation you mention in Mr. Boyle’s book of colours I once\r\nmade upon myself with the hazard of my eyes. The manner was this; I\r\nlooked a very little while upon the sun in the looking-glass with my\r\nright eye, and then turned my eyes into a dark corner of my chamber,\r\nand winked, to observe the impression made, and the circles of colours\r\nwhich encompassed it, and how they decayed by degrees, and at last\r\nvanished. This I repeated a second and a third time. At the third time,\r\nwhen the phantasm of light and colours about it were almost vanished,\r\nintending my fancy upon them to see their last appearance, I found, to\r\nmy amazement, that they began to return, and by little and little to\r\nbecome as lively and vivid as when I had newly looked upon the sun. But\r\nwhen I ceased to intend my fancy upon them, they vanished again. After\r\nthis, I found, that as often as I went into the dark, and intended my\r\nmind upon them, as when a man looks earnestly to see any thing which\r\nis difficult to be seen, I could make the phantasm return without\r\nlooking any more upon the sun; and the oftener I made it return, the\r\nmore easily I could make it return again. And at length, by repeating\r\nthis without looking any more upon the sun, I made such an impression\r\non my eye, that, if I looked upon the clouds, or a book, or any bright\r\nobject, I saw upon it a round bright spot of light like the sun, and,\r\nwhich is still stranger, though I looked upon the sun with my right eye\r\nonly, and not with my left, yet my fancy began to make an impression\r\nupon my left eye, as well as upon my right. For if I shut my right\r\neye, or looked upon a book or the clouds with my left eye, I could\r\nsee the spectrum of the sun almost as plain as with my right eye, if\r\nI did but intend my fancy a little while upon it; for at first, if I\r\nshut my right eye, and looked with my left, the spectrum of the sun\r\ndid not appear till I intended my fancy upon it; but by repeating,\r\nthis appeared every time more easily. And now, in a few hours’ time, I\r\nhad brought my eyes to such a pass, that I could look upon no bright\r\nobject with either eye but I saw the sun before me, so that I durst\r\nneither write nor read; but to recover the use of my eyes, shut myself\r\nup in my chamber made dark, for three days together, and used all means\r\nto divert my imagination from the sun. For if I thought upon him, I\r\npresently saw his picture, though I was in the dark. But by keeping in\r\nthe dark, and employing my mind about other things, I began in three or\r\nfour days to have some use of my eyes again; and, by forbearing to look\r\nupon bright objects, recovered them pretty well, though not so well but\r\nthat, for some months after, the spectrum of the sun began to return\r\nas often as I began to meditate upon the phenomena, even though I lay\r\nin bed at midnight with my curtains drawn. But now I have been very\r\nwell for many years, though I am apt to think, if I durst venture my\r\neyes, I could still make the phantasm return by the power of my fancy.\r\nThis story I tell you, to let you understand, that in the observation\r\nrelated by Mr. Boyle, the man’s fancy probably concurred with the\r\nimpression made by the sun’s light to produce that phantasm of the sun\r\nwhich he constantly saw in bright objects. And so your question about\r\nthe cause of this phantasm involves another about the power of fancy,\r\nwhich I must confess is too hard a knot for me to untie. To place this\r\neffect in a constant motion is hard, because the sun ought then to\r\nappear perpetually. It seems rather to consist in a disposition of the\r\nsensorium to move the imagination strongly, and to be easily moved,\r\nboth by the imagination and by the light, as often as bright objects\r\nare looked upon.”\r\n\r\nThese observations possess in many respects a high degree of interest.\r\nThe fact of the transmission of the impression from the retina of the\r\none eye to that of the other is particularly important; and it deserves\r\nto be remarked, as a singular coincidence, that I had occasion to\r\nobserve and to describe the same phenomena above twenty years ago,[120]\r\nand long before the observations of Sir Isaac were communicated to the\r\nscientific world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  _His Acquaintance with Dr. Pemberton, who edits the Third Edition of\r\n    the Principia—His first Attack of ill Health—His Recovery—He is\r\n    taken ill in consequence of attending the Royal Society—His Death\r\n    on the 20th March, 1727—His Body lies in state—His Funeral—He is\r\n    buried in Westminster Abbey—His Monument described—His Epitaph—A\r\n    Medal struck in honour of him—Roubiliac’s full-length Statue of him\r\n    erected in Cambridge—Division of his Property—His Successors._\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1722, Sir Isaac was desirous of publishing a third\r\nedition of his Principia, and the premature death of Mr. Cotes\r\nhaving deprived him of his valuable aid, he had the good fortune to\r\nbecome acquainted with Dr. Henry Pemberton, a young and accomplished\r\nphysician, who had cultivated mathematical learning with considerable\r\nsuccess. M. Poleni, an eminent professor in the University of Padua,\r\nhaving endeavoured, on the authority of a new experiment, to overturn\r\nthe common opinion respecting the force of bodies in motion, and to\r\nestablish that of Leibnitz in its place, Dr. Pemberton transmitted\r\nto Dr. Mead a demonstration of its inaccuracy. Dr. Mead communicated\r\nthis paper to Sir Isaac, who not only highly approved of it, but added\r\na demonstration of his own, drawn from another consideration of the\r\nsubject; and this was printed without his name, as a postscript to\r\nPemberton’s paper, when it appeared in the Transactions.[121]\r\n\r\nIn a short time after the commencement of their acquaintance, Sir Isaac\r\nengaged Dr. Pemberton to superintend the new edition of the Principia.\r\nIn discharging this duty, Dr. Pemberton had occasion to make many\r\nremarks on this work, which Sir Isaac always received with the utmost\r\ngoodness, and the new edition appeared with numerous alterations in\r\n1726. On the occasions upon which he had personal intercourse with Sir\r\nIsaac, and which were necessarily numerous, he endeavoured to learn\r\nhis opinions on various mathematical subjects, and to obtain some\r\nhistorical information respecting his inventions and discoveries. Sir\r\nIsaac entered freely into all these topics and during the conversations\r\nwhich took place, and while they were reading together Dr. Pemberton’s\r\npopular account of Sir Isaac’s discoveries, he obtained the most\r\nperfect evidence that, though his memory was much decayed, yet he was\r\nfully able to understand his own writings.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty years of his life, which he spent in London,\r\nthe charge of his domestic concerns devolved upon his beautiful and\r\naccomplished niece, Mrs. Catharine Barton, the wife of Colonel Barton,\r\nfor whom, as we have already seen, the Earl of Halifax had conceived\r\nthe warmest affection. This lady, who had been educated at her uncle’s\r\nexpense, married Mr. Conduit, and continued to reside with her husband\r\nin Sir Isaac’s house till the time of his death.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1722, when he had reached the eightieth year of his age, he\r\nwas seized with an incontinence of urine, which was ascribed to stone\r\nin the bladder, and was considered incurable. By means of a strict\r\nregimen, however, and other precautions, he was enabled to alleviate\r\nhis complaint, and to procure long intervals of ease. At this time he\r\ngave up the use of his carriage, and always went out in a chair. He\r\ndeclined all invitations to dinner, and at his own house he had only\r\nsmall parties. In his diet he was extremely temperate. Though he took a\r\nlittle butcher meat, yet the principal articles of his food were broth,\r\nvegetables, and fruit, of which he always ate very heartily. In spite\r\nof all his precautions, however, he experienced a return of his old\r\ncomplaint, and in August, 1724, he passed a stone the size of a pea,\r\nwhich came away in two pieces, the one at the distance of two days from\r\nthe other. After some months of tolerable good health, he was seized\r\nin January, 1725, with a violent cough and inflammation of the lungs;\r\nand in consequence of this attack, he was prevailed upon, with some\r\ndifficulty, to take up his residence at Kensington, where his health\r\nexperienced a decided improvement. In February, 1725, he was attacked\r\nin both his feet with a fit of the gout, of which he had received a\r\nslight warning a few years before, and the effect of this new complaint\r\nwas to produce a great and beneficial change in his general health. On\r\nSunday the 7th March, when his head was clearer and his memory stronger\r\nthan Mr. Conduit had known it to be for some time, he entered into a\r\nlong conversation on various subjects in astronomy. He explained to\r\nMr. Conduit how comets might be formed out of the light of vapours\r\ndischarged from the sun and the fixed stars as the centres of systems.\r\nHe conceived that these luminaries were replenished by the same comets\r\nbeing again returned to them; and upon this principle he explained\r\nthe extraordinary lights which were seen among the fixed stars by\r\nHipparchus, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler’s disciples, and which he supposed\r\nto arise from the additional fuel which they received.[122]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the improvement which his health had experienced,\r\nhis indisposition was still sufficiently severe to unfit him for the\r\ndischarge of his duties at the mint; and as his old deputy was confined\r\nwith the dropsy, he was desirous in 1725 of resigning his office to\r\nMr. Conduit. Difficulties probably were experienced in making this\r\narrangement, but his nephew discharged for him all the duties of his\r\noffice; and during the last year of his life he hardly ever went to the\r\nmint.\r\n\r\nBut though every kind of motion was calculated to aggravate his\r\ncomplaint, and though he had derived from absolute rest and from\r\nthe air at Kensington the highest benefit, yet great difficulty was\r\nexperienced in preventing him from occasionally going to town. Feeling\r\nhimself able for the journey, he went to London on Tuesday the 28th of\r\nFebruary, 1727, to preside at a meeting of the Royal Society. On the\r\nfollowing day Mr. Conduit considered him better than he had been for\r\nmany years, and Sir Isaac was himself so sensible of this improvement\r\nin his health, that he assured his nephew that on the Sunday preceding,\r\nhe had slept from eleven o’clock at night till eight o’clock next\r\nmorning without waking. He had undergone, however, great fatigue in\r\nattending the meeting of the Royal Society, and in paying and receiving\r\nvisits, and the consequence of this was a violent return of his former\r\ncomplaint. He returned to Kensington on Saturday the 4th March, and was\r\nattended by Dr. Mead and Dr. Cheselden, who pronounced his disease to\r\nbe stone, and held out no hopes of his recovery. From the time of his\r\nlast journey to London he had experienced violent fits of pain with\r\nvery short intermissions; and though the drops of sweat ran down his\r\nface during these severe paroxysms, yet he never uttered a cry or a\r\ncomplaint, or displayed the least marks of peevishness or impatience;\r\nbut during the short intervals of relief which occurred, he smiled and\r\nconversed with his usual gayety and cheerfulness. On Wednesday the 15th\r\nof March he seemed a little better; and slight, though groundless hopes\r\nwere entertained of his recovery. On the morning of Saturday the 18th\r\nhe read the newspapers, and carried on a pretty long conversation with\r\nDr. Mead, when all his senses and faculties were strong and vigorous;\r\nbut at six o’clock of the same evening he became insensible, and he\r\ncontinued in that state during the whole of Sunday, and till Monday the\r\n20th, when he expired between one and two o’clock in the morning, in\r\nthe eighty-fifth year of his age.\r\n\r\nHis body was removed from Kensington to London, and on Tuesday the\r\n28th March it lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was thence\r\nconveyed to Westminster Abbey, where it was buried near the entrance\r\ninto the choir on the left-hand. The pall was supported by the Lord\r\nHigh Chancellor, the Dukes of Roxburghe and Montrose, and the Earls\r\nof Pembroke, Sussex, and Macclesfield, who were Fellows of the Royal\r\nSociety. The Hon. Sir Michael Newton, Knight of the Bath, was chief\r\nmourner, and was followed by some other relations, and several\r\ndistinguished characters who were intimately acquainted with the\r\ndeceased. The funeral service was performed by the Bishop of Rochester,\r\nattended by the prebend and choir.\r\n\r\nSensible of the high honour which they derived from their connexion\r\nwith so distinguished a philosopher, the relations of Sir Isaac Newton\r\nwho inherited his personal estate,[123] agreed to devote 500_l._ to\r\nthe erection of a monument to his memory, and the dean and chapter\r\nof Westminster appropriated for it a place in the most conspicuous\r\npart of the Abbey, which had often been refused to the greatest of\r\nour nobility. This monument was erected in 1731. On the front of a\r\nsarcophagus resting on a pedestal are sculptured in basso-relievo\r\nyouths bearing in their hands the emblems of Sir Isaac’s principal\r\ndiscoveries. One carries a prism, another a reflecting telescope, a\r\nthird is weighing the sun and planets with a steelyard, a fourth is\r\nemployed about a furnace, and two others are loaded with money newly\r\ncoined. On the sarcophagus is placed the figure of Sir Isaac in a\r\ncumbent posture, with his elbow resting on several of his works. Two\r\nyouths stand before him with a scroll, on which is drawn a remarkable\r\ndiagram relative to the solar system, and above that is a converging\r\nseries. Behind the sarcophagus is a pyramid, from the middle of\r\nwhich rises a globe in mezzo-relievo, upon which several of the\r\nconstellations are drawn, in order to show the path of the comet of\r\n1681, whose period Sir Isaac had determined, and also the position of\r\nthe solstitial colure mentioned by Hipparchus, and by means of which\r\nSir Isaac had, in his Chronology, fixed the time of the Argonautic\r\nexpedition. A figure of Astronomy as Queen of the Sciences sits\r\nweeping on the Globe with a sceptre in her hand, and a star surmounts\r\nthe summit of the pyramid. The following epitaph is inscribed on the\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\n                             Hic situs est\r\n                     Isaacus Newton, Eques Auratus,\r\n                       Qui Animi Vi prope divina,\r\n                       Planetarum Motus, Figuras,\r\n                  Cometarum Semitas, Oceanique Æstus,\r\n                     Sua Mathesi facem preferente,\r\n                          Primus demonstravit.\r\n                    Radiorum Lucis dissimilitudines,\r\n                Colorumque inde nascentium Proprietates,\r\n          Quas nemo antea vel suspicatus erat, pervestigavit,\r\n                  Naturæ, Antiquitates, S.

It had on one side the head of the philosopher,\r\nwith the motto, _Felix cognoscere causas_, and on the reverse a figure\r\nrepresenting the mathematics.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th February, 1755, a magnificent full-length statue of Sir\r\nIsaac Newton in white marble was erected in the antechapel of Trinity\r\nCollege. He is represented standing on a pedestal in a loose gown,\r\nholding a prism, and looking upwards with an expression of the deepest\r\nthought. On the pedestal is the inscription,\r\n\r\n    Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit.\r\n      Who surpassed all men in genius.\r\n\r\nThis statue, executed by Roubiliac, was erected at the expense of\r\nDr. Robert Smith, the author of the _Compleat System of Optics_, and\r\nprofessor of astronomy and experimental philosophy at Cambridge.—It has\r\nbeen thus described by a modern poet:\r\n\r\n    Hark where the organ, full and clear,\r\n    With loud hosannas charms the ear;\r\n    Behold, a prism within his hands,\r\n    Absorbed in thought great Newton stands\r\n    Such was his brow, and looks serene,\r\n    His serious gait and musing mien,\r\n    When taught on eagle wings to fly,\r\n    He traced the wonders of the sky;\r\n    The chambers of the sun explored,\r\n    Where tints of thousand hues were stored.\r\n\r\nDr. Smith likewise bequeathed the sum of 500_l._ for executing a\r\npainting on glass for the window at the south end of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. The subject represents the presentation of Sir Isaac Newton\r\nto his majesty George III., who is seated under a canopy with a laurel\r\nchaplet in his hand, and attended by the British Minerva, apparently\r\nadvising him to reward merit in the person of the great philosopher.\r\nBelow the throne, the Lord Chancellor Bacon is proposing to register\r\nthe reward about to be conferred upon Sir Isaac. The original drawing\r\nof this absurd picture was executed by Cypriani, and cost one hundred\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\nThe personal estate of Sir Isaac Newton, which was worth about\r\n32,000_l._, was divided among his four nephews and four nieces of the\r\nhalf-blood, the grandchildren of his mother by the Reverend Mr. Smith.\r\nThe family estates of Woolsthorpe and Sustern he bequeathed to John\r\nNewton, the heir-at-law, whose great-grandfather was Sir Isaac’s uncle.\r\nThis gentleman does not seem to have sufficiently valued the bequest,\r\nfor he sold them in 1732, to Edmund Turnor of Stoke Rocheford.[124] A\r\nshort time before his death, Sir Isaac gave away an estate in Berkshire\r\nto the sons and daughter of a brother of Mrs. Conduit, who, in\r\nconsequence of their father dying before Sir Isaac, had no share in the\r\npersonal estate; and he also gave an estate of the same value, which he\r\nbought at Kensington, to Catharine, the only daughter of Mr. Conduit,\r\nwho afterward married Mr. Wallop, the eldest son of Lord Lymington.\r\nThis lady was afterward Viscountess Lymington, and the estate of\r\nKensington descended to the late Earl of Portsmouth, by whom it was\r\nsold. Sir Isaac was succeeded as master and warden in the mint by his\r\nnephew, John Conduit, Esq., who wrote a treatise on the gold and silver\r\ncoin, and who died in 1737, leaving behind him his wife and daughter,\r\nthe former of whom died in 1739, in the 59th year of her age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  _Permanence of Newton’s Reputation—Character of his Genius—His\r\n    Methods of Investigation similar to that used by Galileo—Error in\r\n    ascribing his Discoveries to the Use of the Methods recommended by\r\n    Lord Bacon—The Pretensions of the Baconian Philosophy examined—Sir\r\n    Isaac Newton’s social Character—His great Modesty—The Simplicity of\r\n    his Character—His religious and moral Character—His Hospitality and\r\n    Mode of Life—His Generosity and Charity—His Absence—His personal\r\n    Appearance—Statues and Pictures of him—Memorials and Recollections\r\n    of him._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the last days of Sir Isaac Newton, and such the last laurels\r\nwhich were shed over his grave. A century of discoveries has since his\r\nday been added to science; but brilliant as these discoveries are,\r\nthey have not obliterated the minutest of his labours, and have served\r\nonly to brighten the halo which encircles his name. The achievements\r\nof genius, like the source from which they spring, are indestructible.\r\nActs of legislation and deeds of war may confer a high celebrity, but\r\nthe reputation which they bring is only local and transient; and while\r\nthey are hailed by the nation which they benefit, they are reprobated\r\nby the people whom they ruin or enslave. The labours of science, on\r\nthe contrary, bear along with them no counterpart of evil. They are\r\nthe liberal bequests of great minds to every individual of their race,\r\nand wherever they are welcomed and honoured they become the solace of\r\nprivate life, and the ornament and bulwark of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Sir Isaac Newton’s discoveries has been sufficiently\r\nexhibited in the preceding chapters: the peculiar character of his\r\ngenius, and the method which he pursued in his inquiries, can be\r\ngathered only from the study of his works, and from the history of\r\nhis individual labours. Were we to judge of the qualities of his mind\r\nfrom the early age at which he made his principal discoveries, and\r\nfrom the rapidity of their succession, we should be led to ascribe to\r\nhim that quickness of penetration, and that exuberance of invention,\r\nwhich is more characteristic of poetical than of philosophical genius.\r\nBut we must recollect that Newton was placed in the most favourable\r\ncircumstances for the development of his powers. The flower of his\r\nyouth and the vigour of his manhood were entirely devoted to science.\r\nNo injudicious guardian controlled his ruling passion, and no ungenial\r\nstudies or professional toils interrupted the continuity of his\r\npursuits. His discoveries were, therefore, the fruit of persevering and\r\nunbroken study; and he himself declared, that whatever service he had\r\ndone to the public was not owing to any extraordinary sagacity, but\r\nsolely to industry and patient thought.\r\n\r\nInitiated early into the abstractions of geometry, he was deeply imbued\r\nwith her cautious spirit; and if his acquisitions were not made with\r\nthe rapidity of intuition, they were at least firmly secured; and the\r\ngrasp which he took of his subject was proportional to the mental\r\nlabour which it had exhausted. Overlooking what was trivial, and\r\nseparating what was extraneous, he bore down with instinctive sagacity\r\non the prominences of his subject, and having thus grappled with its\r\ndifficulties, he never failed to intrench himself in its strongholds.\r\n\r\nTo the highest powers of invention Newton added, what so seldom\r\naccompanies them, the talent of simplifying and communicating his\r\nprofoundest speculations.[125] In the economy of her distributions,\r\nnature is seldom thus lavish of her intellectual gifts. The inspired\r\ngenius which creates is rarely conferred along with the matured\r\njudgment which combines, and yet without the exertion of both the\r\nfabric of human wisdom could never have been reared. Though a ray from\r\nheaven kindled the vestal fire, yet an humble priesthood was required\r\nto keep alive the flame.\r\n\r\nThe method of investigating truth by observation and experiment, so\r\nsuccessfully pursued in the Principia, has been ascribed by some\r\nmodern writers of great celebrity to Lord Bacon; and Sir Isaac Newton\r\nis represented as having owed all his discoveries to the application\r\nof the principles of that distinguished writer. One of the greatest\r\nadmirers of Lord Bacon has gone so far as to characterize him as a\r\nman who has had no rival in the times which are past, and as likely\r\nto have none in those which are to come. In a eulogy so overstrained\r\nas this, we feel that the language of panegyric has passed into that\r\nof idolatry; and we are desirous of weighing the force of arguments\r\nwhich tend to depose Newton from the high-priesthood of nature, and to\r\nunsettle the proud destinies of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler.\r\n\r\nThat Bacon was a man of powerful genius, and endowed with varied\r\nand profound talent,—the most skilful logician,—the most nervous\r\nand eloquent writer of the age which he adorned, are points which\r\nhave been established by universal suffrage. The study of ancient\r\nsystems had early impressed him with the conviction that experiment\r\nand observation were the only sure guides in physical inquiries; and,\r\nignorant though he was of the methods, the principles, and the details\r\nof the mathematical sciences, his ambition prompted him to aim at the\r\nconstruction of an artificial system by which the laws of nature might\r\nbe investigated, and which might direct the inquiries of philosophers\r\nin every future age. The necessity of experimental research, and of\r\nadvancing gradually from the study of facts to the determination of\r\ntheir cause, though the groundwork of Bacon’s method, is a doctrine\r\nwhich was not only inculcated but successfully followed by preceding\r\nphilosophers. In a letter from Tycho Brahe to Kepler, this industrious\r\nastronomer urges his pupil “to lay a solid foundation for his views\r\nby actual observation, and then by ascending from these to strive to\r\nreach the causes of things;” and it was no doubt under the influence of\r\nthis advice that Kepler submitted his wildest fancies to the test of\r\nobservation, and was conducted to his most splendid discoveries. The\r\nreasonings of Copernicus, who preceded Bacon by more than a century,\r\nwere all founded upon the most legitimate induction. Dr. Gilbert had\r\nexhibited in his treatise on the magnet[126] the most perfect specimen\r\nof physical research. Leonardo da Vinci had described in the clearest\r\nmanner the proper method of philosophical investigation;[127] and\r\nthe whole scientific career of Galileo was one continued example of\r\nthe most sagacious application of observation and experiment to the\r\ndiscovery of general laws. The names of Paracelsus, Van Helmont, and\r\nCardan have been ranged in opposition to this constellation of great\r\nnames, and while it is admitted that even they had thrown off the yoke\r\nof the schools, and had succeeded in experimental research, their\r\ncredulity and their pretensions have been adduced as a proof that to\r\nthe “bulk of philosophers” the method of induction was unknown. The\r\nfault of this argument consists in the conclusion being infinitely\r\nmore general than the fact. The errors of these men were not founded\r\non their ignorance, but on their presumption. They wanted the patience\r\nof philosophy and not her methods. An excess of vanity, a waywardness\r\nof fancy, and an insatiable appetite for that species of passing fame\r\nwhich is derived from eccentricity of opinion, moulded the reasonings\r\nand disfigured the writings of these ingenious men; and it can scarcely\r\nadmit of a doubt, that, had they lived in the present age, their\r\nphilosophical character would have received the same impress from the\r\npeculiarity of their tempers and dispositions. This is an experiment,\r\nhowever, which cannot now be made; but the history of modern science\r\nsupplies the defect, and the experience of every man furnishes a proof\r\nthat in the present age there are many philosophers of elevated talents\r\nand inventive genius who are as impatient of experimental research as\r\nParacelsus, as fanciful as Cardan, and as presumptuous as Van Helmont.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown that the distinguished philosophers who flourished\r\nbefore Bacon were perfect masters both of the principles and practice\r\nof inductive research, it becomes interesting to inquire whether or\r\nnot the philosophers who succeeded him acknowledged any obligation to\r\nhis system, or derived the slightest advantage from his precepts. If\r\nBacon constructed a method to which modern science owes its existence,\r\nwe shall find its cultivators grateful for the gift, and offering the\r\nrichest incense at the shrine of a benefactor whose generous labours\r\nconducted them to immortality. No such testimonies, however, are to be\r\nfound. Nearly two hundred years have gone by, teeming with the richest\r\nfruits of human genius, and no grateful disciple has appeared to\r\nvindicate the rights of the alleged legislator of science. Even Newton,\r\nwho was born and educated after the publication of the Novum Organon,\r\nnever mentions the name of Bacon or his system, and the amiable and\r\nindefatigable Boyle treated him with the same disrespectful silence.\r\nWhen we are told, therefore, that Newton owed all his discoveries to\r\nthe method of Bacon, nothing more can be meant than that he proceeded\r\nin that path of observation and experiment which had been so warmly\r\nrecommended in the Novum Organon; but it ought to have been added,\r\nthat the same method was practised by his predecessors,—that Newton\r\npossessed no secret that was not used by Galileo and Copernicus,—and\r\nthat he would have enriched science with the same splendid discoveries\r\nif the name and the writings of Bacon had never been heard of.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the subject we shall now proceed to examine the\r\nBaconian process itself, and consider if it possesses any merit as an\r\nartificial method of discovery, or if it is at all capable of being\r\nemployed, for this purpose, even in the humblest walks of scientific\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nThe process of Lord Bacon was, we believe, never tried by any\r\nphilosopher but himself. As the subject of its application, he\r\nselected that of heat. With his usual erudition, he collected all\r\nthe facts which science could supply,—he arranged them in tables,—he\r\ncross-questioned them with all the subtlety of a pleader,—he combined\r\nthem with all the sagacity of a judge,—and he conjured with them by all\r\nthe magic of his exclusive processes. But, after all this display of\r\nphysical logic, nature thus interrogated was still silent. The oracle\r\nwhich he had himself established refused to give its responses, and the\r\nministering priest was driven with discomfiture from his own shrine.\r\nThis example, in short, of the application of his system, will remain\r\nto future ages as a memorable instance of the absurdity of attempting\r\nto fetter discovery by any artificial rules.\r\n\r\nNothing even in mathematical science can be more certain than that a\r\ncollection of scientific facts are of themselves incapable of leading\r\nto discovery, or to the determination of general laws, unless they\r\ncontain the predominating fact or relation in which the discovery\r\nmainly resides. A vertical column of arch-stones possesses more\r\nstrength than the same materials arranged in an arch without the\r\nkey-stone. However nicely they are adjusted, and however nobly the arch\r\nmay spring, it never can possess either equilibrium or stability. In\r\nthis comparison all the facts are supposed to be necessary to the final\r\nresult; but, in the inductive method, it is impossible to ascertain the\r\nrelative importance of any facts, or even to determine if the facts\r\nhave any value at all, till the master-fact which constitutes the\r\ndiscovery has crowned the zealous efforts of the aspiring philosopher.\r\nThe mind then returns to the dark and barren waste over which it has\r\nbeen hovering; and by the guidance of this single torch it embraces,\r\nunder the comprehensive grasp of general principles, the multifarious\r\nand insulated phenomena which had formerly neither value nor\r\nconnexion. Hence it must be obvious to the most superficial thinker,\r\nthat discovery consists either in the detection of some concealed\r\nrelation—some deep-seated affinity which baffles ordinary research,\r\nor in the discovery of some simple fact which is connected by slender\r\nramifications with the subject to be investigated; but which, when once\r\ndetected, carries us back by its divergence to all the phenomena which\r\nit embraces and explains.\r\n\r\nIn order to give additional support to these views, it would be\r\ninteresting to ascertain the general character of the process by\r\nwhich a mind of acknowledged power actually proceeds in the path of\r\nsuccessful inquiry. The history of science does not furnish us with\r\nmuch information on this head, and if it is to be found at all, it must\r\nbe gleaned from the biographies of eminent men. Whatever this process\r\nmay be in its details, if it has any, there cannot be the slightest\r\ndoubt that in its generalities at least it is the very reverse of the\r\nmethod of induction. The impatience of genius spurns the restraints of\r\nmechanical rules, and never will submit to the plodding drudgery of\r\ninductive discipline. The discovery of a new fact unfits even a patient\r\nmind for deliberate inquiry. Conscious of having added to science\r\nwhat had escaped the sagacity of former ages, the ambitious spirit\r\ninvests its new acquisition with an importance which does not belong\r\nto it. He imagines a thousand consequences to flow from his discovery:\r\nhe forms innumerable theories to explain it, and he exhausts his\r\nfancy in trying all its possible relations to recognised difficulties\r\nand unexplained facts. The reins, however, thus freely given to his\r\nimagination, are speedily drawn up. His wildest conceptions are all\r\nsubjected to the rigid test of experiment, and he has thus been hurried\r\nby the excursions of his own fancy into new and fertile paths, far\r\nremoved from ordinary observation. Here the peculiar character of his\r\nown genius displays itself by the invention of methods of trying his\r\nown speculations, and he is thus often led to new discoveries far more\r\nimportant and general than that by which he began his inquiry. For a\r\nconfirmation of these views, we may refer to the History of Kepler’s\r\nDiscoveries; and if we do not recognise them to the same extent in the\r\nlabours of Newton, it is because he kept back his discoveries till\r\nthey were nearly perfected, and therefore withheld the successive steps\r\nof his inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe social character of Sir Isaac Newton was such as might have been\r\nexpected from his intellectual attainments. He was modest, candid,\r\nand affable, and without any of the eccentricities of genius, suiting\r\nhimself to every company, and speaking of himself and others in such\r\na manner that he was never even suspected of vanity. “But this,”\r\nsays Dr. Pemberton, “I immediately discovered in him, which at once\r\nboth surprised and charmed me. Neither his extreme great age nor his\r\nuniversal reputation had rendered him stiff in opinion, or in any\r\ndegree elated. Of this I had occasion to have almost daily experience.\r\nThe remarks I continually sent him by letters on the Principia were\r\nreceived with the utmost goodness. These were so far from being any\r\nways displeasing to him, that on the contrary it occasioned him to\r\nspeak many kind things of me to my friends, and to honour me with a\r\npublic testimony of his good opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe modesty of Sir Isaac Newton in reference to his great discoveries\r\nwas not founded on any indifference to the fame which they conferred,\r\nor upon any erroneous judgment of their importance to science. The\r\nwhole of his life proves, that he knew his place as a philosopher,\r\nand was determined to assert and vindicate his rights. His modesty\r\narose from the depth and extent of his knowledge, which showed him\r\nwhat a small portion of nature he had been able to examine, and how\r\nmuch remained to be explored in the same field in which he had himself\r\nlaboured. In the magnitude of the comparison he recognised his own\r\nlittleness; and a short time before his death he uttered this memorable\r\nsentiment:—“I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to\r\nmyself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore,\r\nand diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a\r\nprettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all\r\nundiscovered before me.” What a lesson to the vanity and presumption\r\nof philosophers,—to those especially who have never even found the\r\nsmoother pebble or the prettier shell! What a preparation for the\r\nlatest inquiries, and the last views of the decaying spirit,—for those\r\ninspired doctrines which alone can throw a light over the dark ocean of\r\nundiscovered truth!\r\n\r\nThe native simplicity of Sir Isaac Newton’s mind is finely portrayed\r\nin the affecting letter in which he acknowledges to Locke that he had\r\nthought and spoken of him uncharitably; and the humility and candour in\r\nwhich he asks forgiveness could have emanated only from a mind as noble\r\nas it was pure.\r\n\r\nIn the religious and moral character of our author there is much to\r\nadmire and to imitate. While he exhibited in his life and writings an\r\nardent regard for the general interests of religion, he was at the same\r\ntime a firm believer in revelation. He was too deeply versed in the\r\nScriptures, and too much imbued with their spirit, to judge harshly of\r\nother men who took different views of them from himself. He cherished\r\nthe great principles of religious toleration, and never scrupled to\r\nexpress his abhorrence of persecution, even in its mildest form.\r\nImmorality and impiety he never permitted to pass unreproved; and when\r\nDr. Halley[128] ventured to say any thing disrespectful to religion,\r\nhe invariably checked him, and said, “I have studied these things,—you\r\nhave not.”[129]\r\n\r\nAfter Sir Isaac Newton took up his residence in London, he lived in\r\na very handsome style, and kept his carriage, with an establishment\r\nof three male and three female servants. In his own house he was\r\nhospitable and kind, and on proper occasions he gave splendid\r\nentertainments, though without ostentation or vanity. His own diet was\r\nfrugal, and his dress was always simple; but on one occasion, when he\r\nopposed the Honourable Mr. Annesley in 1705, as a candidate for the\r\nuniversity, he is said to have put on a suit of laced clothes.\r\n\r\nHis generosity and charity had no bounds, and he used to remark, that\r\nthey who gave away nothing till they died never gave at all. Though his\r\nwealth had become considerable by a prudent economy, yet he had always\r\na contempt for money, and he spent a considerable part of his income\r\nin relieving the poor, in assisting his relations, and in encouraging\r\ningenuity and learning. The sums which he gave to his relations at\r\ndifferent times were enormous;[130] and in 1724 he wrote a letter to\r\nthe Lord Provost of Edinburgh, offering to contribute 20_l._ per annum\r\nto a provision for Mr. Maclaurin, provided he accepted the situation of\r\nassistant to Mr. James Gregory, who was professor of mathematics in the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nThe habits of deep meditation which Sir Isaac Newton had acquired,\r\nthough they did not show themselves in his intercourse with society,\r\nexercised their full influence over his mind when in the midst of\r\nhis own family. Absorbed in thought he would often sit down on his\r\nbedside after he rose, and remain there for hours without dressing\r\nhimself, occupied with some interesting investigation which had fixed\r\nhis attention. Owing to the same absence of mind, he neglected to take\r\nthe requisite quantity of nourishment, and it was therefore often\r\nnecessary to remind him of his meals.[131]\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton is supposed to have had little knowledge of the world,\r\nand to have been very ignorant of the habits of society. This opinion\r\nhas, we think, been rashly deduced from a letter which he wrote in the\r\ntwenty-seventh year of his age to his young friend, Francis Aston,\r\nEsq., who was about to set out on his travels. This letter is a highly\r\ninteresting production; and while it shows much knowledge of the human\r\nheart, it throws a strong light upon the character and opinions of its\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nIn his personal appearance, Sir Isaac Newton was not above the\r\nmiddle size, and in the latter part of his life was inclined to be\r\ncorpulent. According to Mr. Conduit “he had a very lively and piercing\r\neye, a comely and gracious aspect, with a fine head of hair as white\r\nas silver, without any baldness, and when his peruke was off was a\r\nvenerable sight.” Bishop Atterbury asserts,[132] on the other hand,\r\nthat the lively and piercing eye did not belong to Sir Isaac during the\r\nlast twenty years of his life. “Indeed,” says he, “in the whole air\r\nof his face and make there was nothing of that penetrating sagacity\r\nwhich appears in his compositions. He had something rather languid in\r\nhis look and manner which did not raise any great expectation in those\r\nwho did not know him.” This opinion of Bishop Atterbury is confirmed\r\nby an observation of Mr. Thomas Hearne,[133] who says “that Sir Isaac\r\nwas a man of no very promising aspect. He was a short, well-set man.\r\nHe was full of thought, and spoke very little in company, so that his\r\nconversation was not agreeable. When he rode in his coach, one arm\r\nwould be out of his coach on one side and the other on the other.” Sir\r\nIsaac never wore spectacles, and never “lost more than one tooth to the\r\nday of his death.”\r\n\r\nBesides the statue of Sir Isaac Newton executed by Roubiliac, there is\r\na bust of him by the same artist in the library of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. Several good paintings of him are extant. Two of these are\r\nin the hall of the Royal Society of London, and have, we believe, been\r\noften engraved. Another, by Vanderbank, is in the apartments of the\r\nMaster’s lodge in Trinity College, and has been engraved by Vertue.\r\nAnother, by Valentine Ritts, is in the landing-place near the entrance\r\nto Trinity College library; but the best, from which our engraving is\r\ncopied, was painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller, and is in the possession of\r\nLord Egremont at Petworth. In the university library there is preserved\r\na cast taken from his face after death.\r\n\r\nEvery memorial of so great a man as Sir Isaac Newton has been preserved\r\nand cherished with peculiar veneration. His house at Woolsthorpe,\r\nof which we have given an engraving, has been religiously protected\r\nby Mr. Turnor of Stoke Rocheford, the proprietor. Dr. Stukeley, who\r\nvisited it in Sir Isaac’s lifetime, on the 13th October, 1721, gives\r\nthe following description of it in his letter to Dr. Mead, written in\r\n1727: “’Tis built of stone as is the way of the country hereabouts, and\r\na reasonable good one. They led me up stairs and showed me Sir Isaac’s\r\nstudy, where I suppose he studied when in the country in his younger\r\ndays, or perhaps when he visited his mother from the university. I\r\nobserved the shelves were of his own making, being pieces of deal\r\nboxes which probably he sent his books and clothes down in on those\r\noccasions. There were some years ago two or three hundred books in it\r\nof his father-in-law, Mr. Smith, which Sir Isaac gave to Dr. Newton of\r\nour town.”[134]\r\n\r\nWhen the house was repaired in 1798, a tablet of white marble was\r\nput up by Mr. Turnor in the room where Sir Isaac was born, with the\r\nfollowing inscription:\r\n\r\n“Sir Isaac Newton, son of John Newton, Lord of the manor of\r\nWoolsthorpe, was born in this room on the 25th December, 1642.”\r\n\r\n    Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night,\r\n    God said, “Let Newton be,” and all was light.\r\n\r\nThe following lines have been written upon the house:\r\n\r\n    Here Newton dawned, here lofty wisdom woke,\r\n    And to a wondering world divinely spoke.\r\n    If Tully glowed, when Phædrus’ steps he trode,\r\n    Or fancy formed Philosophy a god;\r\n    If sages still for Homer’s birth contend\r\n    The Sons of Science at this dome must bend.\r\n    All hail the shrine! All hail the natal day,\r\n    Cam boasts his noon,—This _Cot_ his morning ray.\r\n\r\nThe house is now occupied by a person of the name of John Wollerton. It\r\nstill contains the two dials made by Newton, but the styles of both are\r\nwanting. The celebrated apple-tree, the fall of one of the apples of\r\nwhich is said to have turned the attention of Newton to the subject of\r\ngravity, was destroyed by wind about four years ago; but Mr. Turnor has\r\npreserved it in the form of a chair.[135]\r\n\r\nThe chambers which Sir Isaac inhabited at Cambridge are known by\r\ntradition. They are the apartments next to the great gate of Trinity\r\nCollege, and it is believed that they then communicated by a staircase\r\nwith the observatory in the Great Tower,—an observatory which was\r\nfurnished by the contributions of Newton, Cotes, and others. His\r\ntelescope, represented in _fig. 3_, page 41, is preserved in the\r\nlibrary of the Royal Society of London, and his globe, his universal\r\nring-dial, quadrant, compass, and a reflecting telescope said to have\r\nbelonged to him, in the library of Trinity College. There is also in\r\nthe same collection a long and curled lock of his silver white hair.\r\nThe door of his bookcase is in the Museum of the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts, letters, and other papers of Newton have been\r\npreserved in different collections. His correspondence with Cotes\r\nrelative to the second edition of the Principia, and amounting to\r\nbetween sixty and a hundred letters, a considerable portion of the\r\nmanuscript of that work, and two or three letters to Dr. Keill on\r\nthe Leibnitzian controversy, are preserved in the library of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge. Newton’s letters to Flamstead, about thirty-four\r\nin number, are deposited in the library of Corpus Christi College,\r\nOxford.[136] Several letters of Newton, and, we believe, the original\r\nspecimen which he drew up of the Principia, exist among the papers\r\nof Mr. William Jones (the father of Sir William Jones), which are\r\npreserved at Shirburn Castle, in the library of Lord Macclesfield.\r\nBut the great mass of Newton’s papers came into the possession of the\r\nPortsmouth family through his niece, Lady Lymington, and have been\r\nsafely preserved by that noble family. There is reason to believe that\r\nthey contain nothing which could be peculiarly interesting to science;\r\nbut as the correspondence of Newton with contemporary philosophers must\r\nthrow considerable light on his personal history, we trust that it will\r\nere long be given to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE FAMILY OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1705, Sir Isaac gave into the Herald’s Office an elaborate\r\npedigree, stating upon oath _that he had reason to believe_ that John\r\nNewton of Westby, in the county of Lincoln, was his great-grandfather’s\r\nfather, and that this was the same John Newton who was buried in\r\nBasingthorpe church, on the 22d December, 1563. This John Newton had\r\nfour sons, John, Thomas, Richard, and William Newton of Gunnerly,\r\nthe last of whom was great-grandfather to Sir John Newton, Bart., of\r\nHather. Sir Isaac considered himself as descended from the eldest of\r\nthese, _he having, by tradition from his kindred ever since he can\r\nremember, reckoned himself next of kin (among the Newtons) to Sir John\r\nNewton’s family_.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree, founded upon these and other considerations, was\r\naccompanied by a certificate from Sir John Newton, of Thorpe, Bart.,\r\nwho states that he had heard his father speak of Sir Isaac Newton _as\r\nof his relation and kinsman_, and that _he himself believed that Sir\r\nIsaac was descended from John Newton, son to John Newton of Westby, but\r\nknoweth not in what particular manner_.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of Sir Isaac, as entered at the Herald’s Office, does not\r\nseem to have been satisfactory either to himself or to his successors,\r\nas it could not be traced with certainty beyond his grandfather; and\r\nit will be seen from the following interesting correspondence, that\r\nupon making further researches, he had found some reason to believe\r\nthat he was of Scotch extraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Extract of a Letter from the Reverend Dr. Reid of Glasgow to Dr.\r\n    Gregory of Edinburgh, dated 14th March, 1784._\r\n\r\n  “I send you on the other page an anecdote respecting Sir Isaac\r\n  Newton, which I do not remember whether I ever happened to mention\r\n  to you in conversation. If his descent be not clearly ascertained\r\n  (as I think it is not in the books I have seen), might it not be\r\n  worth while to inquire if evidence can be found to confirm the\r\n  account which he is said to have given of himself. Sheriff Cross\r\n  was very zealous about it when death put a stop to his inquiries.\r\n\r\n  “When I lived in old Aberdeen above twenty years ago, I happened\r\n  to be conversing over a pipe of tobacco with a gentleman of that\r\n  country, who had been lately at Edinburgh. He told me that he had\r\n  been often in company with Mr. Hepburn of Keith, with whom I had\r\n  the honour of some acquaintance. He said that, speaking of Sir\r\n  Isaac Newton, Mr. Hepburn mentioned an anecdote, which he had from\r\n  Mr. James Gregory, professor of mathematics at Edinburgh, which was\r\n  to this purpose:\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Gregory, being at London for some time after he resigned the\r\n  mathematical chair, was often with Sir Isaac Newton. One day Sir\r\n  Isaac said to him, ‘Gregory, I believe you don’t know that I am\r\n  connected with Scotland.’—‘Pray how, Sir Isaac?’ said Gregory. Sir\r\n  Isaac said he was told that his grandfather was a gentleman of East\r\n  Lothian; that he came to London with King James at his accession to\r\n  the crown of England, and there spent his fortune, as many more\r\n  did at that time, by which his son (Sir Isaac’s father) was reduced\r\n  to mean circumstances. To this Gregory bluntly replied, ‘Newton a\r\n  gentleman of East Lothian, I never heard of a gentleman of East\r\n  Lothian of that name.’ Upon this Sir Isaac said, ‘that being very\r\n  young when his father died, he had it only by tradition, and it\r\n  might be a mistake;’ and immediately turned the conversation to\r\n  another subject.\r\n\r\n  “I confess I suspected that the gentleman who was my author had\r\n  given some colouring to this story, and therefore I never mentioned\r\n  it for a good many years.\r\n\r\n  “After I removed to Glasgow, I came to be very intimately\r\n  acquainted with Mr. Cross, then sheriff of Lanark, and one day at\r\n  his own house mentioned this story, without naming my author, of\r\n  whom I expressed some diffidence.\r\n\r\n  “The sheriff immediately took it up as a matter worth being\r\n  inquired into. He said he was well acquainted with Mr. Hepburn\r\n  of Keith (who was then alive), and that he would write him to\r\n  know whether he ever heard Mr. Gregory say that he had such a\r\n  conversation with Sir Isaac Newton. He said he knew that Mr. Keith,\r\n  the ambassador, was also intimate with Mr. Gregory, and that he\r\n  would write him to the same purpose.\r\n\r\n  “Some time after, Mr. Cross told me that he had answers from both\r\n  the gentlemen above mentioned, and that both remembered to have\r\n  heard Mr. Gregory mention the conversation between him and Sir\r\n  Isaac Newton, to the purpose above narrated, and at the same time\r\n  acknowledged that they had made no further inquiry about the matter.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Cross, however, continued the inquiry, and a short time before\r\n  his death told me that all he had learned was, that there is,\r\n  or was lately, a baronet’s family of the name of Newton in West\r\n  Lothian or Mid Lothian (I have forgot which): that there is a\r\n  tradition in that family that Sir Isaac Newton wrote a letter to\r\n  the old knight that then was (I think Sir John Newton of Newton was\r\n  his name), desiring to know what children, and particularly what\r\n  sons he had, their age, and what professions they intended: that\r\n  the old baronet never deigned to return an answer to this letter,\r\n  which his family was sorry for, as they thought Sir Isaac might\r\n  have intended to do something for them.”\r\n\r\nSeveral years after this letter was written, a Mr. Barron, a relation\r\nof Sir Isaac Newton, seems to have been making inquiries respecting the\r\nfamily of his ancestor, and in consequence of this the late Professor\r\nRobison applied to Dr. Reid, to obtain from him a more particular\r\naccount of the remarkable conversation between Sir Isaac and Mr.\r\nJames Gregory referred to in the preceding letter. In answer to this\r\nrequest, Dr. Reid wrote the following letter, for which I was indebted\r\nto John Robison, Esq. Sec. R. S. E., who found it among his father’s\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Letter from Dr. Reid to Professor Robison respecting the Family of\r\n    Sir Isaac Newton._\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n  “I am very glad to learn by yours of April 4, that a Mr. Barron, a\r\n  near relation of Sir Isaac Newton, is anxious to inquire into the\r\n  descent of that great man, as the family cannot trace it farther,\r\n  with any certainty, than his grandfather. I therefore, as you\r\n  desire, send you a precise account of all I know; and am glad to\r\n  have this opportunity, before I die, of putting this information in\r\n  hands that will make the proper use of it, if it shall be found of\r\n  any use.\r\n\r\n  “Several years before I left Aberdeen (which I did in 1764), Mr.\r\n  Douglas of Feckel, the father of Sylvester Douglas, now a barrister\r\n  at London, told me, that having been lately at Edinburgh, he\r\n  was often in company with Mr. Hepburn of Keith, a gentleman of\r\n  whom I had some acquaintance, by his lodging a night at my house\r\n  at New Machar, when he was in the rebel army in 1745. That Mr.\r\n  Hepburn told him that he had heard Mr. James Gregory, professor\r\n  of mathematics, Edinburgh, say, that being one day in familiar\r\n  conversation with Sir Isaac Newton at London, Sir Isaac said,\r\n  ‘Gregory, I believe you don’t know that I am a Scotchman.’—‘Pray,\r\n  how is that?’ said Gregory. Sir Isaac said he was informed that\r\n  his grandfather (or great-grandfather) was a gentleman of East (or\r\n  West) Lothian: that he went to London with King James the I. at his\r\n  accession to the crown of England: and that he attended the court\r\n  in expectation, as many others did, until he spent his fortune, by\r\n  which means his family was reduced to low circumstances. At the\r\n  time this was told me Mr. Gregory was dead, otherwise I should have\r\n  had his own testimony, for he was my mother’s brother. I likewise\r\n  thought at that time that it had been certainly known that Sir\r\n  Isaac had been descended from an old English family, as I think\r\n  is said in his _eloge_ before the Academy of Sciences at Paris,\r\n  and therefore I never mentioned what I had heard for many years,\r\n  believing that there must be some mistake in it.\r\n\r\n  “Some years after I came to Glasgow, I mentioned (I believe for\r\n  the first time) what I had heard to have been said by Mr. Hepburn\r\n  to Mr. Cross, late sheriff of this county, whom you will remember.\r\n  Mr. Cross was moved by this account, and immediately said, ‘I know\r\n  Mr. Hepburn very well, and I know he was intimate with Mr. Gregory:\r\n  I shall write him this same night, to know whether he heard Mr.\r\n  Gregory say so or not.’ After some reflection, he added, ‘I know\r\n  that Mr. Keith, the ambassador, was also an intimate acquaintance\r\n  of Mr. Gregory, and as he is at present in Edinburgh, I shall\r\n  likewise write to him this night.’\r\n\r\n  “The next time I waited on Mr. Cross he told me that he had wrote\r\n  both to Mr. Hepburn and Mr. Keith, and had an answer from both, and\r\n  that both of them testified that they had several times heard Mr.\r\n  James Gregory say, that Sir Isaac Newton told him what is above\r\n  expressed, but that neither they nor Mr. Gregory, as far as they\r\n  knew, ever made any further inquiry into the matter. This appeared\r\n  very strange both to Mr. Cross and me, and he said he would\r\n  reproach them for their indifference, and would make inquiry as\r\n  soon as he was able.\r\n\r\n  “He lived but a short time after this, and in the last conversation\r\n  I had with him upon the subject, he said, that all he had yet\r\n  learned was, that there was a Sir John Newton of Newton in one of\r\n  the counties of Lothian (but I have forgot which), some of whose\r\n  children were yet alive: that they reported that their father, Sir\r\n  John, had a letter from Sir Isaac Newton, desiring to know the\r\n  state of his family, what children he had, particularly what sons,\r\n  and in what way they were. The old knight never returned an answer\r\n  to this letter, thinking probably that Sir Isaac was some upstart,\r\n  who wanted to claim a relation to his worshipful house. This\r\n  omission the children regretted, conceiving that Sir Isaac might\r\n  have had a view of doing something for their benefit.\r\n\r\n  “After this I mentioned occasionally in conversation what I knew,\r\n  hoping that these facts might lead to some more certain discovery,\r\n  but I found more coldness about the matter than I thought it\r\n  deserved. I wrote an account of it to Dr. Gregory, your colleague,\r\n  that he might impart it to any member of the Antiquarian Society\r\n  who he judged might have the curiosity to trace the matter further.\r\n\r\n  “In the year 1787, my colleague, Mr. Patrick Wilson, professor\r\n  of astronomy, having been in London, told me on his return that\r\n  he had met accidentally with a James Hutton, Esq. of Pimlico,\r\n  Westminster, a near relation of Sir Isaac Newton,[137] to whom he\r\n  mentioned what he had heard from me with respect to Sir Isaac’s\r\n  descent, and that I wished much to know something more decisive\r\n  on that subject. Mr. Hutton said, if I pleased to write to him\r\n  he would give me all the information he could give. I wrote him\r\n  accordingly, and had a very polite answer, dated at Bath, 25th\r\n  December, 1787, which is now before me. He says, ‘I shall be glad\r\n  when I return to London, if I can find in some old notes of my\r\n  mother any thing that may fix the certainty of Sir Isaac’s descent.\r\n  If he spoke so to Mr. James Gregory, it is most certain he spoke\r\n  truth. But Sir Isaac’s grandfather, not his great-grandfather, must\r\n  be the person who came from Scotland with King James I. If I find\r\n  any thing to the purpose, I will take care it shall reach you.’\r\n\r\n  “In consequence of this letter I expected another from Mr. Hutton\r\n  when he should return to London, but have never had any. Mr. Wilson\r\n  told me he was a very old man, and whether he be dead or alive I\r\n  know not.\r\n\r\n  “This is all I know of the matter, and for the facts above\r\n  mentioned I pledge my veracity. I am much obliged to you, dear sir,\r\n  for the kind expressions of your affection and esteem, which, I\r\n  assure you, are mutual on my part, and I sincerely sympathize with\r\n  you on your afflicting state of health, which makes you consider\r\n  yourself as out of the world, and despair of seeing me any more.\r\n\r\n  “I have been long out of the world by deafness and extreme old age.\r\n  I hope, however, if we should not meet again in this world, that we\r\n  shall meet and renew our acquaintance in another. In the mean time,\r\n  I am with great esteem, dear sir, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n            “THO. REID.\r\n\r\n    “_Glasgow College_,\r\n    ”_12th April, 1792_.”\r\n\r\nThis curious letter I published in the Ed. Phil. Journal for October 1,\r\n1820. It excited the particular attention of the late George Chalmers,\r\nEsq., who sent me an elaborate letter upon the subject; but as I was at\r\nthat time in the expectation of obtaining some important information\r\nthrough other channels, this letter was not published. This hope,\r\nhowever, has been disappointed. A careful search has been made through\r\nthe charter-chest of the Newtons of Newton in East Lothian, by Mr.\r\nRichard Hay Newton, the representative of that family, but no document\r\nwhatever has been found that can throw the least light upon the matter.\r\nIt deserves to be remarked, however, that Sir Richard Newton, the\r\nalleged correspondent of Sir Isaac, appears to have destroyed his\r\ncorrespondence; for though the charter-chest contains the letters\r\nof his predecessors for some generations, yet there is not a single\r\nepistolary document either of his own or of his lady’s.\r\n\r\nHitherto the evidence of Sir Isaac’s Scottish descent has been derived\r\nchiefly from his conversation with Mr. James Gregory; but I am enabled,\r\nby the kindness of Mr. Robison, to corroborate this evidence by the\r\nfollowing information, derived, as will be seen, from the family of\r\nthe Newtons of Newton. Among various memoranda in the handwriting of\r\nProfessor Robison, who at one time proposed to write the life of Sir\r\nIsaac, are the following:—\r\n\r\n“1st, Lord Henderland informed me in a letter dated March, 1794,\r\nthat he had heard from his infancy that Sir Isaac considered himself\r\nas descended from the family of Newton of Newton. This he heard\r\nfrom his uncle Richard Newton of Newton (who was third son of Lord\r\nWilliam Hay of Newhall):” “He said that Sir Isaac wrote to Scotland\r\nto learn whether any descendants of that family remained, and this\r\n(it was thought) with the view to leave some of his fortune to the\r\nfamily possessing the estate with the title of baronet. Mr. Newton,\r\nnot having this honour, and being a shy man, did not encourage the\r\ncorrespondence, because he did not consider _himself_ as of kin to Sir\r\nIsaac, &c.”\r\n\r\n“2d, Information communicated to me by Hay Newton, Esq., of that ilk,\r\n18th August, 1800.”\r\n\r\n“The late Sir Richard Newton of Newton, Bart., chief of that name,\r\nhaving no male children, settled the estate and barony of Newton in\r\nEast Lothian county upon his relation Richard Hay Newton, Esq., son\r\nof Lord William Hay.”[138]—“It cannot be discovered how long the\r\nfamily of Newton have been in possession of the barony, there being\r\nno tradition concerning that circumstance further than that they came\r\noriginally from England at a very distant period, and settled on these\r\nlands.”—“The celebrated Sir Isaac Newton was a distant relation of the\r\nfamily, and corresponded with the last baronet, the above-mentioned Sir\r\nRichard Newton.”\r\n\r\nThe preceding documents furnish the most complete evidence that the\r\nconversation respecting Sir Isaac Newton’s family took place between\r\nhim and Mr. Gregory; and the testimony of Lord Henderland proves that\r\nhis own uncle, Richard Newton of Newton, the immediate successor of\r\nSir Richard Newton, with whom Sir Isaac corresponded, was perfectly\r\nconfident that such a correspondence took place.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances prove that Sir Isaac Newton could not trace\r\nhis pedigree with any certainty beyond his grandfather, and that there\r\nwere two different traditions in his family,—one which referred his\r\ndescent to John Newton of Westby, and the other to a gentleman of East\r\nLothian who accompanied King James VI. to England. In the first of\r\nthese traditions he seems to have placed most confidence in 1705, when\r\nhe drew out his traditionary pedigree; but as the conversation with\r\nProfessor James Gregory respecting his Scotch extraction took place\r\n_twenty years_ afterward, namely, between 1725 and 1727, it is probable\r\nthat he had discovered the incorrectness of his first opinions, or at\r\nleast was disposed to attach more importance to the other tradition\r\nrespecting his descent from a Scotch family.\r\n\r\nIn the letter addressed to me by the learned George Chalmers, Esq. I\r\nfind the following observations respecting the immediate relations of\r\nSir Isaac. “The Newtons of Woolsthorpe,” says he, “who were merely\r\nyeomen farmers, were not by any means opulent. The son of Sir Isaac’s\r\nfather’s brother was a carpenter called John. He was afterward\r\nappointed gamekeeper to Sir Isaac, as lord of the manor, and died at\r\nthe age of sixty in 1725. This John had a son, Robert, (John?) who was\r\nSir Isaac’s second cousin, and who became possessed of the whole land\r\nestates at and near Woolsthorpe, which belonged to the great Newton, as\r\nhis heir-at-law.[139] Robert (John?) became a worthless and dissolute\r\nperson, who very soon wasted this ancient patrimony, and falling down\r\nwith a tobacco-pipe in his mouth when he was drunk, it broke in his\r\nthroat, and put an end to his life at the age of thirty years, in 1737.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\n  LETTER FROM SIR ISAAC NEWTON TO FRANCIS ASTON, ESQ., A YOUNG FRIEND\r\n    WHO WAS ON THE EVE OF SETTING OUT UPON HIS TRAVELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Aston was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1678. He held\r\nthe office of Secretary between 1681 and 1685; and he was the author\r\nof some observations on certain unknown ancient characters, which were\r\npublished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1693.\r\n\r\nThis letter has been referred to in pages 270 and 303, and was written\r\nwhen Newton was only twenty-six years of age. It is in every respect an\r\ninteresting document.\r\n\r\n        “_Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\n            May 18, 1669._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “Since in your letter you give mee so much liberty of spending\r\n  my judgement about what may be to your advantage in travelling,\r\n  I shall do it more freely than perhaps otherwise would have been\r\n  decent. First, then, I will lay down some general rules, most of\r\n  which, I believe, you have considered already; but if any of them\r\n  be new to you, they may excuse the rest; if none at all, yet is my\r\n  punishment more in writing than yours in reading.\r\n\r\n  “When you come into any fresh company, 1. Observe their humours. 2.\r\n  Suit your own carriage thereto, by which insinuation you will make\r\n  their converse more free and open. 3. Let your discours be more in\r\n  querys and doubtings than peremptory assertions or disputings, it\r\n  being the designe of travellers to learne, not to teach. Besides,\r\n  it will persuade your acquaintance that you have the greater\r\n  esteem of them, and soe make them more ready to communicate what\r\n  they know to you; whereas nothing sooner occasions disrespect and\r\n  quarrels than peremtorinesse. You will find little or no advantage\r\n  in seeming wiser or much more ignorant than your company. 4. Seldom\r\n  discommend any thing though never so bad, or doe it but moderately,\r\n  lest you bee unexpectedly forced to an unhansom retraction. It\r\n  is safer to commend any thing more than it deserves, than to\r\n  discommend a thing soe much as it deserves; for commendations meet\r\n  not soe often with oppositions, or, at least, are not usually soe\r\n  ill resented by men that think otherwise, as discommendations;\r\n  and you will insinuate into men’s favour by nothing sooner than\r\n  seeming to approve and commend what they like; but beware of doing\r\n  it by a comparison. 5. If you bee affronted, it is better, in\r\n  a forraine country, to pass it by in silence, and with a jest,\r\n  though with some dishonour, than to endeavour revenge; for, in the\r\n  first case, your credit’s ne’er the worse when you return into\r\n  England, or come into other company that have not heard of the\r\n  quarrell. But, in the second case, you may beare the marks of the\r\n  quarrell while you live, if you outlive it at all. But, if you\r\n  find yourself unavoidably engaged, ’tis best, I think, if you can\r\n  command your passion and language, to keep them pretty evenly at\r\n  some certain moderate pitch, not much hightning them to exasperate\r\n  your adversary, or provoke his friends, nor letting them grow\r\n  overmuch dejected to make him insult. In a word, if you can keep\r\n  reason above passion, that and watchfullnesse will be your best\r\n  defendants. To which purpose you may consider, that, though such\r\n  excuses as this,—He provok’t mee so much I could not forbear,—may\r\n  pass among friends, yet amongst strangers they are insignificant,\r\n  and only argue a traveller’s weaknesse.\r\n\r\n  “To these I may add some general heads for inquirys or\r\n  observations, such as at present I can think on. As, 1. To observe\r\n  the policys, wealth, and state-affairs of nations, so far as a\r\n  solitary traveller may conveniently doe. 2. Their impositions upon\r\n  all sorts of people, trades, or commoditys, that are remarkable.\r\n  3. Their laws and customs, how far they differ from ours. 4. Their\r\n  trades and arts wherein they excell or come short of us in England.\r\n  5. Such fortifications as you shall meet with, their fashion,\r\n  strength, and advantages for defence, and other such military\r\n  affairs as are considerable. 6. The power and respect belonging to\r\n  their degrees of nobility or magistracy. 7. It will not be time\r\n  mispent to make a catalogue of the names and excellencys of those\r\n  men that are most wise, learned, or esteemed in any nation. 8.\r\n  Observe the mechanisme and manner of guiding ships. 9. Observe the\r\n  products of nature in several places, especially in mines, with\r\n  the circumstances of mining and of extracting metals or minerals\r\n  out of their oare, and of refining them; and if you meet with any\r\n  transmutations out of their own species into another (as out of\r\n  iron into copper, out of any metall into quicksilver, out of one\r\n  salt into another, or into an insipid body, &c.), those, above all,\r\n  will be worth your noting, being the most luciferous, and many\r\n  times lucriferous experiments too, in philosophy. 10. The prices of\r\n  diet and other things. 11. And the staple commoditys of places.\r\n\r\n  “These generals (such as at present I could think of), if they\r\n  will serve for nothing else, yet they may assist you in drawing\r\n  up a modell to regulate your travells by. As for particulars,\r\n  these that follow are all that I can now think of, viz. Whether at\r\n  Schemnitium, in Hungary (where there are mines of gold, copper,\r\n  iron, vitrioll, antimony, &c.), they change iron into copper by\r\n  dissolving it in a vitriolate water, which they find in cavitys of\r\n  rocks in the mines, and then melting the slimy solution in a strong\r\n  fire, which in the cooling proves copper. The like is said to be\r\n  done in other places, which I cannot now remember; perhaps, too, it\r\n  may be done in Italy. For about twenty or thirty years agone there\r\n  was a certain vitrioll came from thence (called Roman vitrioll),\r\n  but of a nobler virtue than that which is now called by that name;\r\n  which vitrioll is not now to be gotten, because, perhaps, they\r\n  make a greater gain by some such trick as turning iron into copper\r\n  with it than by selling it. 2. Whether, in Hungary, Sclavonia,\r\n  Bohemia, near the town Eila, or at the mountains of Bohemia near\r\n  Silesia, there be rivers whose waters are impregnated with gold;\r\n  perhaps, the gold being dissolved by some corrosive waters like\r\n  _aqua regis_, and the solution carried along with the streame, that\r\n  runs through the mines. And whether the practice of laying mercury\r\n  in the rivers, till it be tinged with gold, and then straining the\r\n  mercury through leather, that the gold may stay behind, be a secret\r\n  yet, or openly practised. 3. There is newly contrived, in Holland,\r\n  a mill to grind glasses plane withall, and I think polishing them\r\n  too; perhaps it will be worth the while to see it. 4. There is in\r\n  Holland one —— Borry, who some years since was imprisoned by the\r\n  Pope, to have extorted from him secrets (as I am told) of great\r\n  worth, both as to medicine and profit, but he escaped into Holland,\r\n  where they have granted him a guard. I think he usually goes\r\n  clothed in green. Pray inquire what you can of him, and whether\r\n  his ingenuity be any profit to the Dutch. You may inform yourself\r\n  whether the Dutch have any tricks to keep their ships from being\r\n  all worm-eaten in their voyages to the Indies. Whether pendulum\r\n  clocks do any service in finding out the longitude, &c.\r\n\r\n  “I am very weary, and shall not stay to part with a long\r\n  compliment, only I wish you a good journey, and God be with you.\r\n\r\n            “IS. NEWTON.\r\n\r\n  “Pray let us hear from you in your travells. I have given your two\r\n  books to Dr. Arrowsmith.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\n  “A REMARKABLE AND CURIOUS CONVERSATION BETWEEN SIR ISAAC NEWTON AND\r\n    MR. CONDUIT.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I was on Sunday night, the 7th of March, 1724–5, at Kensington\r\n  with Sir Isaac Newton, in his lodgings, just after he was come\r\n  out of a fit of the gout, which he had had in both his feet, for\r\n  the first time, in the eighty-third year of his age. He was\r\n  better after it, and his head clearer, and memory stronger than I\r\n  had known them for some time. He then repeated to me, by way of\r\n  discourse, very distinctly, though rather in answer to my queries\r\n  than in one continued narration, what he had often hinted to me\r\n  before, viz. that it was his conjecture (he would affirm nothing)\r\n  that there was a sort of revolution in the heavenly bodies; that\r\n  the vapours and light emitted by the sun, which had their sediment\r\n  as water and other matter, had gathered themselves by degrees into\r\n  a body, and attracted more matter from the planets, and at last\r\n  made a secondary planet (viz. one of those that go round another\r\n  planet) and then by gathering to them, and attracting more matter,\r\n  became a primary planet; and then by increasing still became a\r\n  comet, which after certain revolutions, by coming nearer and nearer\r\n  to the sun, had all its volatile parts condensed, and became a\r\n  matter fit to recruit and replenish the sun (which must waste by\r\n  the constant heat and light it emitted) as a fagot would this\r\n  fire if put into it (we were sitting by a wood fire), and that\r\n  that would probably be the effect of the comet of 1680, sooner or\r\n  later, for, by the observations made upon it, it appeared, before\r\n  it came near the sun, with a tail only two or three degrees long;\r\n  but by the heat it contracted in going so near the sun, it seemed\r\n  to have a tail of thirty or forty degrees when it went from it;\r\n  that he could not say when this comet would drop into the sun;\r\n  it might perhaps have five or six revolutions more first, but\r\n  whenever it did it would so much increase the heat of the sun\r\n  that this earth would be burnt, and no animals in it could live.\r\n  That he took the three phenomena seen by Hipparchus, Tycho Brahe,\r\n  and Kepler’s disciples to have been of this kind, for he could\r\n  not otherwise account for an extraordinary light as those were,\r\n  appearing all at once among the fixed stars (all which he took\r\n  to be suns enlightening other planets as our sun does ours) as\r\n  big as Mercury or Venus seems to us, and gradually diminishing\r\n  for sixteen months, and then sinking into nothing. He seemed to\r\n  doubt whether there were not intelligent beings superior to us\r\n  who superintended these revolutions of the heavenly bodies by the\r\n  direction of the Supreme Being. He appeared also to be very clearly\r\n  of opinion that the inhabitants of this world were of a short\r\n  date, and alleged as one reason for that opinion, that all arts,\r\n  as letters, ships, printing, needle, &c., were discovered within\r\n  the memory of history, which could not have happened if the world\r\n  had been eternal; and that there were visible marks of ruin upon it\r\n  which could not be effected by a flood only. When I asked him how\r\n  this earth could have been repeopled if ever it had undergone the\r\n  same fate it was threatened with hereafter by the comet of 1680, he\r\n  answered, that required the power of a Creator. He said he took all\r\n  the planets to be composed of the same matter with this earth, viz.\r\n  earth, water, stones, &c., but variously concocted. I asked him why\r\n  he would not publish his conjectures as conjectures, and instanced\r\n  that Kepler had communicated his; and though he had not gone near\r\n  so far as Kepler, yet Kepler’s guesses were so just and happy that\r\n  they had been proved and demonstrated by him. His answer was, ‘I\r\n  do not deal in conjectures.’ But upon my talking to him about the\r\n  four observations that had been made of the comet of 1680, at 574\r\n  years’ distance, and asking him the particular times, he opened\r\n  his _Principia_, which laid on the table, and showed me there the\r\n  particular periods, viz. 1st, the Julium Sidus, in the time of\r\n  Justinian, in 1106, in 1680.\r\n\r\n  And I, observing that he said there of that comet, ‘incidet in\r\n  corpus solis,’ and in the next paragraph adds, ‘stellæ fixæ refici\r\n  possunt,’ told him I thought he owned there what we had been\r\n  talking about, viz. that the comet would drop into the sun, and\r\n  that fixed stars were recruited and replenished by comets when\r\n  they dropped into them; and, consequently, that the sun would be\r\n  recruited too; and asked him why he would not own as freely what he\r\n  thought of the sun as well as what he thought of the fixed stars.\r\n  He said, ‘that concerned us more;’ and, laughing, added, ‘that he\r\n  had said enough for people to know his meaning.’”\r\n\r\nThe preceding paper, with the title prefixed to it, was first published\r\nby Mr. Turnor in his _Collections, &c._ p. 172. It was found among the\r\nPortsmouth manuscripts, in the handwriting of Mr. Conduit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Marquis La Place.—See _Systême du Monde_, p. 336.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir Isaac Newton told Mr. Conduit, that he had often heard his\r\nmother say that when he was born he was so little that they might have\r\nput him into a quart mug.\r\n\r\n[3] In Leicestershire, and about three miles south-east of Woolsthorpe.\r\n\r\n[4] “I remember once,” says Dr. Stukely, “when I was deputy to Dr.\r\nHailey, secretary at the Royal Society, Sir Isaac talked of these\r\nkind of instruments. That he observed the chief inconvenience in\r\nthem was, that the hole through which the water is transmitted being\r\nnecessarily very small, was subject to be furred up by impurities in\r\nthe water, as those made with sand will wear bigger, which at length\r\ncauses an inequality in time.”—Stukely’s Letter to Dr. Mead.—Turnor’s\r\n_Collections_, p. 177.\r\n\r\n[5] Mr. Clark informed Dr. Stukely that the walls of the room in which\r\nSir Isaac lodged were covered with charcoal drawings of birds, beasts,\r\nmen, ships, and mathematical figures, all of which were very well\r\ndesigned.\r\n\r\n[6] “One of his uncles,” says M. Biot, “having one day found him under\r\na hedge with a book in his hand and entirely absorbed in meditation,\r\ntook it from him, and found that he was occupied in the solution of a\r\nmathematical problem. Struck with finding so serious and so active a\r\ndisposition at so early an age, he urged his mother no longer to thwart\r\nhim, and to send him back to Grantham to continue his studies.” I have\r\nomitted this anecdote in the text, as I cannot find it in Turner’s\r\nCollections, from which M. Biot derived his details of Newton’s\r\ninfancy, nor in any other work.\r\n\r\n[7] Pemberton’s _View of Sir Isaac Newton’s Philosophy_.

Epistolici_.\r\n\r\n[10] Newtoni _Opera_, tom. iv. p. 205, Letter to Oldenburg.\r\n\r\n[11] M. Biot, in his Life of Newton, has stated that Newton was\r\npreceded in the invention of the reflecting telescope by Gregory, _but\r\nprobably without knowing it_. It is quite certain, however, that Newton\r\nwas acquainted with Gregory’s invention, as appears from the following\r\navowal of it. “When I first applied myself to try the effects of\r\nreflection, Mr. Gregory’s _Optica Promota_ (printed in the year 1663)\r\nhaving fallen into my hands, where there is an instrument described\r\nwith a hole in the midst of the object-glass, to transmit the light to\r\nan eye-glass placed behind it, I had thence an occasion of considering\r\nthat sort of construction, and found their disadvantages so great, that\r\nI saw it necessary before I attempted any thing in the practice to\r\nalter the design of them, and place the eye-glass at the side of the\r\ntube rather than at the middle.”—_Letter to Oldenburg_, May 4th, 1672.\r\n\r\n[12] Letter to Oldenburg, February 10, 1671.\r\n\r\n[13] This gentleman was the author of a paper in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions, entitled “Optical Assertions concerning the Rainbow.”\r\nHow such a paper could be published by so learned a body seems in the\r\npresent day utterly incomprehensible. The dials which Linus erected at\r\nLiege, and which were the originals of those formerly in the Priory\r\nGardens in London, are noticed in the Philosophical Transactions for\r\n1703. In one of them the hours were distinguished by touch.\r\n\r\n[14] Newton speaks with singular positiveness on this subject. “For _I\r\nknow_,” says he, “that Mr. Lucas’s observations _cannot hold_ where\r\nthe refracting angle of the prism is full 60°, and the day is clear,\r\nand the full length of the colours is measured, and the breadth of the\r\nimage answers to the sun’s diameter; and seeing I am well assured of\r\nthe truth and exactness of my own observations, I shall be unwilling\r\nto be diverted by any other experiments from having a fair end made of\r\nthis in the first place.” On the supposition that his prism was one of\r\nvery low dispersive power, Mr. Lucas might, with perfect truth, have\r\nused the very same language towards Newton.\r\n\r\n[15] Letter to Oldenburg in 1672, containing his first reply to Huygens.\r\n\r\n[16] In an experiment made by Newton, he had occasion to counteract the\r\nrefraction of a prism of _glass_ by another prism of _water_; and had\r\nhe completed the experiment, and studied the result of it, he could not\r\nhave failed to observe a quantity of uncorrected colour, which would\r\nhave led him to the discovery of the different dispersive powers of\r\nbodies. But in order to increase the refractive power of the water,\r\nhe mixed with it a little sugar of lead, the high dispersive power of\r\nwhich seems to have rendered the dispersive power of the water equal to\r\nthat of the glass, and thus to have corrected the uncompensated colour\r\nof the glass prism.\r\n\r\n[17] See the article OPTICS in the _Edinburgh Encyclopædia_, vol xv. p.\r\n479, _note_.\r\n\r\n[18] “This result was obtained,” as Newton says, “by an assistant\r\nwhose eyes were more critical than mine, and who, by right lines drawn\r\nacross the spectrum, noted the confines of the colours. And this\r\noperation being divers times repeated both on the same and on several\r\npapers, I found that the observations agreed well enough with one\r\nanother.”—OPTICS, Part II. Book III.\r\n\r\n[19] Optics, Book ii. Prop. iv.\r\n\r\n[20] In the same paragraph, when speaking of black bodies becoming hot,\r\nand burning sooner than others, he says that their “effect may proceed\r\npartly from the _multitude of refractions_ in a little room and partly\r\nfrom the easy commotion of so very small corpuscles.”—Optics, Part iii.\r\nProp. vii. p. 235.\r\n\r\n[21] See page 354.\r\n\r\n[22] When Newton speaks of bodies losing their reflecting power from\r\ntheir thinness he means the reflecting power of their second surfaces,\r\nas is evident from the reason he assigns.—See Optics, Part iii. Prop.\r\nxiii. p. 257.\r\n\r\n[23] _Edinburgh Journal of Science_, No. 1. p. 108.\r\n\r\n[24] See the _Phil. Trans._ 1829, Part I. p. 189.\r\n\r\n[25] _Idem._\r\n\r\n[26] _Phil. Trans._ 1819, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[27] If this view of the matter be just, we should expect that\r\nthe specific gravity of the black would exceed that of the yellow\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\n[28] Since the two preceding chapters were written, I have had occasion\r\nto confirm and extend the views which they contain by many new\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n[29] _Physico-Mathesis de Lumine coloribus et iride aliisque annexis._\r\nBonon. 1665.\r\n\r\n[30] This doctrine is thus announced. 1. That the same rays of light\r\nfalling upon the same point of an object will turn into all sorts of\r\ncolours by the various inclination of the object. 2. That colours begin\r\nto appear when two pulses of light are blended so well and so near\r\ntogether that the sense takes them for one.\r\n\r\n[31] This effect is so great, that at the distance of _four_ inches\r\nfrom the point of divergence, the angular inflexion of the _red_ rays\r\nof the first fringe is 12′ 6″, while at the distance of about twenty\r\nfeet, it is only 3′ 55″.\r\n\r\n[32] See the twenty-ninth query at the end of his Optics, where the\r\nsides of a ray are compared with the poles of a magnet.\r\n\r\n[33] The English edition was reprinted at London in 1714, 1721, and\r\n1730, and the Latin one at London in 1706, 1719, 1721, 1728, at\r\nLausanne in 1740, and at Padua in 1773.\r\n\r\n[34] When James I. went to Copenhagen in 1590, to conclude his marriage\r\nwith the Princess Anne of Denmark, he spent eight days under the roof\r\nof Tycho at Uraniburg. As a token of his gratitude, he composed a set\r\nof Latin verses in honour of the astronomer, and left him a magnificent\r\npresent at his departure. He gave him also his royal license for the\r\npublication of his works in England, and accompanied it with the\r\nfollowing complimentary letter:—\r\n\r\n“Nor am I acquainted with these things on the relation of others, or\r\nfrom a mere perusal of your works, but I have seen them with my own\r\neyes, and heard them with my own ears, in your residence at Uraniburg,\r\nduring the various learned and agreeable conversations which I there\r\nheld with you, which even now affect my mind to such a degree, that it\r\nis difficult to decide whether I recollect them with greater pleasure\r\nor admiration.”\r\n\r\n[35] The cube, the sphere, the tetrahedron, the octohedron, the\r\ndodecahedron, and the icosahedron.\r\n\r\n[36] Simon Marius, mathematician to the Marquis of Brandenburg, assures\r\nus that he discovered the satellites of Jupiter in November, 1609.\r\n\r\n[37] It is distinctly stated in the sentence of the Inquisition, that\r\nGalileo’s enemies had charged him with having abjured his opinions in\r\n1616, and affirmed that he had been punished by the Inquisition. In\r\norder to refute these calumnies, Galileo applied to Cardinal Bellarmine\r\nfor a certificate to prove that he neither abjured his opinions nor\r\nsuffered any punishment for them; but that the doctrine of the motion\r\nof the earth and the stability of the sun was only denounced to him\r\nas contrary to Scripture, and as one which could not be defended or\r\nmaintained. Cardinal Bellarmine drew up such a certificate in his own\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\n[38] _Theoricæ Medicearum planetarum ex causis physicis deductæ._ Flor.\r\n1666, 4to.\r\n\r\n[39] M. Delambre maintains that these views of Borelli are only those\r\nof Kepler slightly modified. Newton and Huygens have attached to them\r\na greater value. The last of these philosophers remarks, “Refert\r\nPlutarchus, fuisse jam olim qui putaret ideo manere lunam in orbe suo,\r\nquod vis recedendi a terra, ob motum circularem, inhiberetur pari vi\r\ngravitatis, qua ad terram accedere conaretur.

Having\r\nlost his office, and being compelled to seek the means of subsistence,\r\nhe became tutor to an English nobleman, whom he accompanied to Oxford\r\nin 1656. During his residence in that city he became acquainted with\r\nthe philosophers who established the Royal Society, and upon the\r\ndeath of William Crown, the first secretary, he was appointed in\r\n1663, joint secretary along with Mr. Wilkins. He kept up an extensive\r\ncorrespondence with the philosophers of all nations, and he was the\r\nauthor of several papers in the Philosophical Transactions, and of some\r\nworks which have not acquired much celebrity. He died at Charlton, near\r\nGreenwich, in August, 1677.\r\n\r\n[63] These words in brackets are in the second edition, but not in the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n[64] As this passage is of essential importance in this controversy, we\r\nshall give it in the original. “_Pro differentiis igitur Leibnitianis\r\nD.

Trans. 1715_.\r\n\r\n[71] M. Biot remarks, that the animosity of Newton was not calmed\r\nby the death of Leibnitz, for he had no sooner heard of it than he\r\ncaused to be printed two manuscript letters of Leibnitz, written in\r\nthe preceding year, accompanying them with a very bitter refutation\r\n(en les accompagnant d’un refutation tres-amere). Who that reads this\r\nsentence does not believe that the bitter refutation was written after\r\nLeibnitz’s death? The animosity could not be shown by the simple\r\npublication of the letters. It could reside only in the _bitterness_\r\nof the refutation. The implied charge is untrue; the bitter refutation\r\nwas written before Leibnitz’s death, and consequently he showed no\r\nanimosity over the grave of his rival; and in our opinion none even\r\nbefore his death.\r\n\r\n[72] M. Biot states that Sir Isaac Newton _caused_ this edition of\r\nthe Commercium Epistolicum to be printed; that _Sir Isaac placed_ at\r\nthe head of it a partial abstract of the collection; and that this\r\nabstract _appeared to have been written by himself_. These groundless\r\ncharges may be placed, without any refutation, beside the assertion of\r\nMontucla, that Newton wrote the notes (les notes) on the Commercium\r\nEpistolicum; and the equally incorrect statement of La Croix, that\r\nNewton added to it notes (des notes), with his own hand. We should not\r\nhave noticed the charges of M. Biot, had he not adduced them as proofs\r\nof Newton’s animosity to Leibnitz after his death. See Mr. Herschel’s\r\nHistory of _Mathematics_ in the _Edinburgh Encyclopædia_, vol. xiii. p.\r\n368, _note_.\r\n\r\n[73] See Burnet’s _History of his own Times_, vol. i. p. 697.

Colin was probably a young bachelor of arts whom Newton\r\nseems afterward to have employed in some of his calculations. These\r\nbachelors were distinguished by the title of Dominus, and it was usual\r\nto translate this word and to call them _Sir_. In a letter from Newton\r\nto Flamstead, dated Cambridge, June 29th, 1695, is the following\r\npassage: “I want not your calculations, but your observations only,\r\nfor besides myself and my servant, Sir Collins (whom I can employ for\r\na little money, which I value not) tells me that he can calculate an\r\neclipse and work truly.”\r\n\r\n[76] They are thus dated in Horsley’s edition of Newton’s Works, the\r\n_fourth_ letter having an earlier date than the _third_.\r\n\r\n[77] See _Newtoni Opera_, tom. iv. p. 480, and _Wallasii Opera_, 1693,\r\ntom. ii. p. 391–396.\r\n\r\n[78] _Optics_, part iv. obs. 13.\r\n\r\n[79] For these letters I have been indebted to the kindness of Lord\r\nBraybrooke.\r\n\r\n[80] These three letters have been published by Lord Braybrooke in the\r\nLife and Correspondence of Mr. Pepys.\r\n\r\n[81] This anxiety will be understood from the fact that, by an order of\r\ncouncil dated January 28th, 1674–5, Mr. Newton was excused from making\r\nthe usual payments of one shilling per week, “on account of his low\r\ncircumstances, as he represented.”\r\n\r\n[82] The system of Hobbes was at this time very prevalent. According to\r\nDr. Bentley, “the taverns and coffee-houses, nay, Westminster Hall and\r\nthe very churches, were full of it;” and he was convinced from personal\r\nobservation, that “not one English infidel in a hundred was other than\r\na Hobbist.”—Monk’s _Life of Bentley_, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[83] The draft of this letter is endorsed “J. L. to I. Newton.”\r\n\r\n[84] Dr. Gregory concludes his account of this manuscript, which he\r\nhas kindly permitted me to read, in the following words:—“I do not\r\nknow whether it is true, as stated by Huygens, ‘Newtonum incidisse in\r\nPhrenitim;’ but I think every gentleman who examines this manuscript\r\nwill be of opinion that he must have thoroughly recovered from his\r\nphrenitis before he wrote either the Commentary on the Opinions of\r\nthe Ancients, or the Sketch of his own Theological and Philosophical\r\nOpinions which it contains.”\r\n\r\n[85] This paragraph is as follows:—“Deum esse ens summe perfectum\r\nconcedunt omnes. Entis autem summe perfecti Idea est ut sit substantia,\r\nuna, simplex, indivisibilis, viva et vivifica, ubique semper necessario\r\nexistens, summe intelligens omnia, libere volens bona, voluntate\r\nefficiens possibilia, effectibus nobilioribus similitudinem propriam\r\nquantum fieri potest communicans, omnia in se continens tanquam eorum\r\nprincipium et locus, omnia per presentiam substantialem cernens et\r\nregens, et cum rebus omnibus, secundum leges accuratas ut naturæ totius\r\nfundamentum et causa constanter co-operans, nisi ubi aliter agere bonum\r\nest.”\r\n\r\n[86] The following extract, characteristic of Flamstead’s manner, is\r\nfrom a letter to Newton dated January 6, 1698–9.\r\n\r\n“Upon hearing occasionally that you had sent a letter to Dr. Wallis\r\nabout the parallax of the fixed stars to be printed, and that you had\r\nmentioned me therein with respect to the theory of the moon, I was\r\nconcerned to be publicly brought upon the state about what, perhaps,\r\nwill never be fitted for the public, and thereby the world _put into\r\nan expectation of what perhaps they are never likely to have_. I do\r\nnot love to be printed upon every occasion, much less to be dunned\r\nand teased by foreigners about mathematical things, or to be thought\r\n_by your own people to be trifling_ away my time when I should be\r\nabout the king’s business.” On the first of the above passages in\r\nitalics Flamstead has the following memorandum:—“When Mr. Halley\r\nboasts ’tis done, and given to him as a secret, tells the Society\r\nso and foreigners.” In the second passage in italics, Mr. Flamstead\r\nrefers, in a note, to Mr. Colson’s letter to him, in which he seems\r\nto have represented practical astronomy as trifling. Mr. Flamstead\r\nadds, “Was Mr. Newton a trifler when he read mathematics for a salary\r\nat Cambridge: surely, then, astronomy is of some good use, though\r\nhis place be more beneficial.” For these extracts from the original\r\nmanuscript in the collection of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, I have\r\nbeen indebted to the kindness of Professor Rigaud of Oxford.\r\n\r\n[87] See page 215, note.\r\n\r\n[88] The candidates in 1701 were as follows:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Henry Boyle, afterward Lord Carleton, 180} Both of Trinity\r\n    Mr. Newton                                161} College.\r\n    Mr. Hammond                                64\r\n\r\n[89] The banquet which was on this occasion given in the college\r\nhall to the royal visiter seems to have cost about 1000_l._, and the\r\nuniversity was obliged to borrow 500_l._, to defray the expense of\r\nit.—Monk’s _Life of Bentley_, p. 143, 144.\r\n\r\n[90] The candidates in 1705 were as follows:\r\n\r\n    The Hon.

Dixie Windsor        170\r\n        Mr. Godolphin             162\r\n        Sir Isaac Newton          117\r\n\r\n[91] Journals of the House of Commons, vol. xvii. p. 677, 716.\r\n\r\n[92] Whiston’s “Longitude Discovered.” Lond 1738.\r\n\r\n[93] This anecdote concerning the Chronological manuscript is not\r\ncorrectly given in the Biographia Britannica, and in some of the other\r\nlives of Newton. I have followed implicitly Newton’s own account of it\r\nin the _Phil. Trans. 1725_, vol. xxxiii. No. 389, p. 315.\r\n\r\n[94] M. Biot has supposed that this abstract was an imperfect edition\r\nof Newton’s work on Chronology.\r\n\r\n[95] Father Souciet was supposed by Halley and others to have been the\r\nauthor of these observations, but there is no doubt that they were\r\nwritten by M. Freret.\r\n\r\n[96] It is stated in the _Biogr. Britannica_, Art. _Newton_, that the\r\ncopy of the French translation was not accompanied with the refutation.\r\nThough the reverse of this is not distinctly stated by Sir Isaac\r\nhimself, yet it may be inferred from his observations.\r\n\r\n[97] Vol. xxxiii. No. 389, p. 315.\r\n\r\n[98] According to Whiston, Sir Isaac wrote out eighteen copies\r\nof this chapter with his own hand, differing little from one\r\nanother.—_Whiston’s Life_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[99] This work is the first article in the fifth volume of Dr.\r\nHersley’s edition of Newton’s works. The next article in the volume is\r\nentitled, “A Short Chronicle from a MS., the property of the Reverend\r\nDr. Ekins, Dean of Carlisle;” which is nothing more than the abstract\r\nof the Chronology already printed in the same volume. We cannot even\r\nconjecture the reasons for publishing it, especially as it is less\r\nperfect than the abstract, two or three dates being wanting.\r\n\r\n[100] See vol. xxxiv. p. 205, and vol. xxxv. p. 296.\r\n\r\n[101] See an excellent view of this chronological controversy in an\r\nable note by M. Daunou, attached to Biot’s Life of Newton in the _Biog.\r\nUniverselle_, tom. xxxi. p. 180.\r\n\r\n[102] This letter is published without any date in the _Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine_ for 1755, vol. xxv. p. 3.

Biot has well remarked that there is absolutely nothing in\r\nthe writings of Newton to justify, or even to authorize, the idea\r\nthat he was an Antitrinitarian. This passage is strangely omitted\r\nin the English translation of Biot’s Life of Newton. We do not know\r\nupon what authority Dr. Thomson states, in his History of the Royal\r\nSociety, that Newton “did not believe in the Trinity,” and that Dr.\r\nHorsley considered Newton’s papers unfit for publication, because they\r\ncontained proofs of his hostility to that doctrine.\r\n\r\n[106] Whiston’s _Memoirs of his own Life_, p. 178, 249, 250.

This publication was reviewed by Dr. Samuel Johnson\r\nin the Literary Magazine, vol. i. p. 89. See Johnson’s Works, vol.\r\nii. p. 328. The original letters are preserved in Trinity College, to\r\nwhich society they were given by Cumberland a short time before his\r\ndeath.”—Monk’s _Life of Bentley_, p. 33, note.\r\n\r\n[113] Mr. Herschel, in his Treatise on Light, § 553, has maintained\r\nthat Newton’s Doctrine of Reflection is accordant with the idea that\r\nthe attractive force extends beyond the repulsive or reflecting force.\r\nIn the query above referred to, Sir Isaac, in the most distinct\r\nmanner, places the sphere of the reflecting force without that of the\r\nattractive one.\r\n\r\n[114] In a tract annexed to his _Appeal to all that doubt or disbelieve\r\nthe truths of the Gospel_. See _Gent. Mag._ 1782, vol. iii. p. 227, 239.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in a letter of Mr. Law’s, quoted in this magazine, that\r\nCharles I. was a diligent reader and admirer of Jacob Behmen; that\r\nhe sent a well-qualified person from England to Goerlitz, in Upper\r\nLusatia, to acquire the German language, and to collect every anecdote\r\nhe could meet with there relative to this great alchymist.\r\n\r\n[115] In a letter to Dr. Halley, dated June 20th, 1686, Sir Isaac\r\nrefers to this paper, and observes, that it is only to be looked upon\r\nas one of his guesses that he did not rely upon.\r\n\r\n[116] See page 273.\r\n\r\n[117] See _Newtoni Opera_, by Horsley, vol. iv. p. 375–382.\r\n\r\n[118] Sir Isaac does not seem to have afterward described this\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n[119] See _Edinburgh Transactions_, vol. ix. p. 433, and the _Edinburgh\r\nJournal of Science_, July, 1829, No. I.

See APPENDIX, p. 316.\r\n\r\n[125] This valuable faculty characterizes all his writings, whether\r\ntheological, chymical, or mathematical; but it is peculiarly displayed\r\nin his treatise on Universal Arithmetic, and in his Optical Lectures.\r\n\r\n[126] _De Magnete_, p. 42, 52, 169, and Pref. p. 30.\r\n\r\n[127] The following passages from Leonardo da Vinci are very striking:\r\n\r\n“Theory is the general, and practice the soldiers.\r\n\r\n“Experiment is the interpreter of the artifices of nature. It never\r\ndeceives us; it is our judgment itself which sometimes deceives us,\r\nbecause we expect from it effects which are contrary to experiment.\r\nWe must consult experiment by varying the circumstances till we have\r\ndeduced from it general laws; for it is it which furnishes true laws.\r\n\r\n“In the study of the sciences which depend on mathematics, those who do\r\nnot consult nature, but authors, are not the children of nature; they\r\nare only her grandchildren. Nature alone is the master of true genius.\r\n\r\n“In treating any particular subject, I would first of all make some\r\nexperiments, because my design is first to refer to experiment, and\r\nthen to demonstrate why bodies are constrained to act in such a\r\nmanner. This is the method which we ought to follow in investigating\r\nthe phenomena of nature. It is very true that nature begins by\r\nreasoning and ends with experiment; but it matters not, _we must take\r\nthe opposite course_; _as I have said, we must begin by experiment_,\r\nand endeavour by its means to discover general principles.” Thus,\r\nsays Venturi, spoke Leonard a century before Bacon, and thus, we\r\nadd, did Leonard tell philosophers all that they required for the\r\nproper investigation of general laws. See _Essai sur les œuvrages\r\nphysico-mathematiques de Leonard de Vinci_, par J. B. Venturi. Paris,\r\n1799, p. 32, 33, &c. See also Carlo Amoretti’s _Memorie storiche su la\r\nvita gli studi e le Opere de Lionardo da Vinci_. Milano, 1804.\r\n\r\n[128] Mr. Hearne, in a memorandum dated April 4th, 1726, states, that\r\na great quarrel happened between Sir Isaac Newton and Mr. Halley. If\r\nthis is true, the difference is likely to have originated in Halley’s\r\nimpiety.\r\n\r\n[129] Professor Rigaud of Oxford heard this anecdote from Dr. Maskelyne.\r\n\r\n[130] “He was very kind to all the Ayscoughs. To one he gave 800_l._,\r\nto another 200_l._, and to a third 100_l._, and many other sums; and\r\nother engagements did he enter into also for them. He was the ready\r\nassistant of all who were any way related to him,—to their children and\r\ngrandchildren.”—_Annual Register_, 1776, vol. xix. p. 25. Sir Isaac\r\ngave some donations to the chapel and parish of Colsterworth. Hearne\r\nsays “that he promised to become a benefactor to the Royal Society, but\r\nfailed.”\r\n\r\n[131] The following anecdote of Sir Isaac’s absence has been published,\r\nbut I cannot vouch for its authenticity. His intimate friend Dr.\r\nStukely, who had been deputy to Dr. Halley as secretary to the Royal\r\nSociety, was one day shown into Sir Isaac’s dining-room, where his\r\ndinner had been for some time served up. Dr. Stukely waited for a\r\nconsiderable time, and getting impatient, he removed the cover from a\r\nchicken, which he ate, replacing the bones under the cover. In a short\r\ntime Sir Isaac entered the room, and after the usual compliments sat\r\ndown to his dinner, but on taking off the cover, and seeing nothing but\r\nbones, he remarked, “How absent we philosophers are. I really thought\r\nthat I had not dined.”\r\n\r\n[132] _Epistolary Correspondence_, vol. i. p. 180, sec. 77.\r\n\r\n[133] MS. Memoranda in the Bodleian Library.\r\n\r\n[134] Turnor’s _Collections_, p. 176.\r\n\r\n[135] The anecdote of the falling apple is mentioned neither by Dr.\r\nStukely nor by Mr. Conduit, and as I have not been able to find any\r\nauthority for it whatever, I did not feel myself at liberty to use it.\r\n\r\n[136] In the Monthly Review for August, 1829, p. 593, it is stated,\r\nthat the correspondence between Newton and Flamstead, from 1680 to\r\n1698, exists in the Sloane collection of Manuscripts in the British\r\nMuseum. Professor Rigaud, however, has had the kindness to inquire\r\ninto the accuracy of this statement, and he has ascertained that these\r\nletters are merely copies, which Dr. Birch had made from the originals\r\nat Oxford.\r\n\r\n[137] See page 288, note.\r\n\r\n[138] This entail was executed in 1724, a year or two before Sir\r\nRichard’s death.—D. B.\r\n\r\n[139] See p. 291.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nMany abbreviations, and some sentences, did not end with periods.\r\nTranscriber added missing periods only at the ends of sentences, and\r\ndid not attempt to resolve other inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unpaired\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nIn some letters, the salutations and dates were printed on the same\r\nline, and the signatures sometimes were printed on the same lines as\r\nthe end of the body.
