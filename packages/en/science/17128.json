Those that first arrived were discussed in \"Nature,\" August\r\n11, 1904.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Schuster's appointment by the University of London, in\r\nOctober, 1904, to the Research Fellowship in National Eugenics, all\r\nmy materials were placed in his hand. He was to select from them\r\nthose families that contained at least three noteworthy kinsmen, to\r\ncompile lists of their achievements on the model of the\r\nabove-mentioned memoir, to verify statements as far as possible, and\r\nto send what he wrote for final approval by the authors of the\r\nseveral replies.\r\n\r\nThis was done by Mr. Schuster. The results were then submitted by him\r\nas an appendix to his Report to the Senate last summer.\r\n\r\nAfter preliminary arrangements, it was determined by the Senate that\r\nthe list of Noteworthy Families should be published according to the\r\ntitle-page of this book, I having agreed to contribute the preface,\r\nMr. Schuster's time being fully occupied with work in another branch\r\nof Eugenics.\r\n\r\nSo the list of \"Noteworthy Families\" in this volume is entirely the\r\nwork of Mr. Schuster, except in respect to some slight alterations\r\nand additions for which I am responsible, as well as for all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n        FRANCIS GALTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--GENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume is the first instalment of a work that admits of wide\r\nextension. Its object is to serve as an index to the achievements of\r\nthose families which, having been exceptionally productive of\r\nnoteworthy persons, seem especially suitable for biographical\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe facts that are given here are avowedly bald and imperfect;\r\nnevertheless, they lead to certain important conclusions. They show,\r\nfor example, that a considerable proportion of the noteworthy members\r\nin a population spring from comparatively few families.\r\n\r\nThe material upon which this book is based is mainly derived from the\r\nanswers made to a circular sent to all the Fellows of the Royal\r\nSociety whose names appear in its Year Book for 1904.\r\n\r\nThe questions were not unreasonably numerous, nor were they\r\ninquisitorial; nevertheless, it proved that not one-half of those who\r\nwere addressed cared to answer them. It was, of course, desirable to\r\nknow a great deal more than could have been asked for or published\r\nwith propriety, such as the proneness of particular families to\r\ngrave constitutional disease. Indeed, the secret history of a family\r\nis quite as important in its eugenic aspect as its public history;\r\nbut one cannot expect persons to freely unlock their dark closets and\r\ndrag forth family skeletons into the light of day. It was necessary\r\nin such a work as this to submit to considerable limitations, while\r\nturning to the fullest account whatever could be stated openly\r\nwithout giving the smallest offence to any of the persons concerned.\r\n\r\nOne limitation against which I still chafe in vain is the\r\nimpracticability of ascertaining so apparently simple a matter as the\r\nnumber of kinsfolk of each person in each specific degree of near\r\nkinship, without troublesome solicitations. It was specially asked\r\nfor in the circular, but by no means generally answered, even by\r\nthose who replied freely to other questions. The reason must in some\r\ncases have been mere oversight or pure inertia, but to a large extent\r\nit was due to ignorance, for I was astonished to find many to whom\r\nthe number of even their near kinsfolk was avowedly unknown.\r\nEmigration, foreign service, feuds between near connections,\r\ndifferences of social position, faintness of family interest, each\r\nproduced their several effects, with the result, as I have reason to\r\nbelieve, that hardly one-half of the persons addressed were able,\r\nwithout first making inquiry of others, to reckon the number of their\r\nuncles, adult nephews, and first cousins. The isolation of some few\r\nfrom even their nearest relatives was occasionally so complete that\r\nthe number of their brothers was unknown. It will be seen that this\r\ndeficiency of information admits of being supplied indirectly, to a\r\nconsiderable degree.\r\n\r\nThe collection of even the comparatively small amount of material now\r\nin hand proved much more troublesome than was anticipated, but as the\r\nobject and limitations of inquiries like this become generally\r\nunderstood, and as experience accumulates, the difficulty of similar\r\nwork in the future will presumably lessen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.--NOTEWORTHINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fellowship of the Royal Society is a distinction highly\r\nappreciated by all members of the scientific world. Fifteen men are\r\nannually selected by its council out of some sixty candidates, each\r\ncandidate being proposed by six, and usually by more, Fellows in a\r\ncertificate containing his qualifications. The candidates themselves\r\nare representatives of a multitude of persons to whom the title would\r\nbe not only an honour but a material advantage. The addition of the\r\nletters \"F.R.S.\" to the names of applicants to any post, however\r\nremotely connected with science, is a valuable testimonial and a\r\nrecognised aid towards success, so the number of those who desire it\r\nis very large. Experience shows that no special education, other than\r\nself-instruction, is really required to attain this honour. Access to\r\nlaboratories, good tuition, and so forth, are doubtless helpful, so\r\nfar that many have obtained the distinction through such aid who\r\ncould not otherwise have done so, but they are far from being\r\nall-important factors of success. The facts that lie patent before\r\nthe eyes of every medical man, engineer, and the members of most\r\nprofessions, afford ample material for researches that would command\r\nthe attention of the scientific world if viewed with intelligence and\r\ncombined by a capable mind.\r\n\r\nIt is so difficult to compare the number of those who might have\r\nsucceeded with the number of those who do, that the following\r\nillustration may perhaps be useful: By adding to the 53 registration\r\ncounties in England, the 12 in Wales, the 33 in Scotland and the 32\r\nin Ireland, an aggregate of 130 is obtained. The English counties,\r\nand the others in a lesser degree, have to be ransacked in order to\r\nsupply the fifteen annually-elected Fellows; so it requires more than\r\neight of these counties to yield an annual supply of a single Fellow\r\nto the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore contended that the Fellows of the Royal Society have\r\nsufficient status to be reckoned \"noteworthy,\" and, such being the\r\ncase, they are a very convenient body for inquiries like these. They\r\nare trained to, and have sympathy with, scientific investigations;\r\nbiographical notices are published of them during their lifetime,\r\nnotably in the convenient compendium \"Who's Who,\" to which there will\r\nbe frequent occasion to refer; and they are more or less known to one\r\nanother, either directly or through friends, making it comparatively\r\neasy to satisfy the occasional doubts which may arise from their\r\ncommunications. It was easier and statistically safer to limit the\r\ninquiry to those Fellows who were living when the circulars were\r\nissued--that is, to those whose names and addresses appear in the\r\n\"Royal Society's Year Book\" of 1904. Some of them have since died,\r\nfull of honours, having done their duty to their generation; others\r\nhave since been elected; so the restriction given here to the term\r\n\"Modern Science\" must be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nAnother and a strong motive for selecting the F.R.S. as subjects of\r\ninquiry was that so long ago as 1863-1864 I had investigated the\r\nantecedents of 180 of those who were then living, who were further\r\ndistinguished by one or other of certain specified and recognised\r\nhonours. My conclusions were briefly described in a Friday evening\r\nlecture, February 27, 1864, before the Royal Institution. These,\r\ntogether with the data on which they were founded, were published in\r\nthe same year in my book \"English Men of Science.\" Readers who desire\r\nfuller information as to the antecedents conducive to success that\r\nare too briefly described further on should refer to the above book.\r\n\r\nThe epithet \"noteworthy\" is applied to achievements in all branches\r\nof effort that rank among the members of any profession or calling as\r\nequal, at least, to that which an F.R.S. holds among scientific men.\r\nThis affords a convenient and sufficiently definite standard of\r\nmerit. I could think of none more appropriate when addressing\r\nscientific men, and it seems to have been generally understood in\r\nthe desired sense. It includes more than a half of those whose names\r\nappear in the modern editions of \"Who's Who,\" which are become less\r\ndiscriminate than the earlier ones. \"Noteworthiness\" is ascribed,\r\nwithout exception, to all whose names appear in the \"Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography,\" but all of these were dead before the date of\r\nthe publication of that work and its supplement. Noteworthiness is\r\nalso ascribed to those whose biographies appear in the \"Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica\" (which includes many who are now alive), and, in other\r\nworks, of equivalent authority. As those persons were considered by\r\neditors of the last named publications to be worthy of note, I have\r\naccepted them, on their authority, as noteworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.--HIGHEST ORDER OF ABILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo attempt is made in this book to deal with the transmission of\r\nability of the very highest order, as the data in hand do not furnish\r\nthe required material, nor will the conclusions be re-examined at\r\nlength that I published many years ago in \"Hereditary Genius.\" Still,\r\nsome explanation is desirable to show the complexity of the\r\nconditions that are concerned with the hereditary transmission of the\r\nhighest ability, which, for the moment, will be considered as the\r\nsame thing as the highest fame.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked that the men who have attained pinnacles\r\nof celebrity failed to leave worthy successors, if any. Many\r\nconcurrent causes aid in producing this result. An obvious one is\r\nthat such persons are apt to be so immersed in their pursuit, and so\r\nwedded to it, that they do not care to be distracted by a wife.\r\nAnother is the probable connection between severe mental strain and\r\nfertility. Women who study hard have, as a class--at least, according\r\nto observant caricaturists--fewer of the more obvious feminine\r\ncharacteristics; but whether this should be considered a cause or a\r\nconsequence, or both, it is difficult to say. A third, and I think\r\nthe most important, reason why the children of very distinguished\r\npersons fall sometimes lamentably short of their parents in ability\r\nis that the highest order of mind results from a fortunate mixture of\r\nincongruous constituents, and not of such as naturally harmonize.\r\nThose constituents are _negatively_ correlated, and therefore the\r\ncompound is unstable in heredity. This is eminently the case in the\r\ntypical artistic temperament, which certainly harmonizes with\r\nBohemianism and passion, and is opposed to the useful qualities of\r\nregularity, foresight, and level common sense. Where these and\r\ncertain other incongruous faculties go together in well-adjusted\r\nproportions, they are capable of achieving the highest success; but\r\ntheir heritage is most unlikely to be transmitted in its entirety,\r\nand ill-balanced compounds of the same constituents are usually of\r\nlittle avail, and sometimes extraordinarily bad. A fourth reason is\r\nthat the highest imaginative power is dangerously near lunacy. If\r\none of the sanest of poets, Wordsworth, had, as he said, not\r\nunfrequently to exert strength, as by shaking a gate-post, to gain\r\nassurance that the world around him was a reality, his mind could not\r\nat those times have been wholly sane. Sanity is difficult to define,\r\nexcept negatively; but, even though we may be convinced of the truths\r\nof the mystic, that nothing is what it seems to be, the\r\nabove-mentioned conduct suggests temporary insanity. It is sufficient\r\nto conclude, as any Philistine would, that whoever has to shake a\r\ngate-post to convince himself that it is not a vision is dangerously\r\nnear madness. Mad people do such things; those who carry on the work\r\nof the world as useful and law-abiding citizens do not. I may add\r\nthat I myself had the privilege of hearing at first hand the\r\nnarrator's own account of this incident, which was much emphasized by\r\nhis gestures and tones. Wordsworth's unexpected sally was in reply to\r\na timid question by the late Professor Bonamy Price, then a young\r\nman, concerning the exact meaning of the lines in his famous \"Ode to\r\nImmortality,\" \"not for these I raise the song of praise; but for\r\nthose obstinate _questionings of sense and outward things_,\" etc.\r\n\r\nI cannot speak from the present returns, but only from my own private\r\nknowledge of the somewhat abnormal frequency with which eccentricity,\r\nor other mental unsoundness, occurs in the families of very able\r\nscientific men. Lombroso, as is well known, strongly asserted the\r\ntruth of this fact, but more strongly, as it seems to myself, than\r\nthe evidence warrants.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not in the highest examples of human genius that\r\nheredity can be most profitably studied, men of high, but not of the\r\nhighest, ability being more suitable. The only objection to their use\r\nis that their names are, for the most part, unfamiliar to the public.\r\n\r\nThe vastness of the social world is very imperfectly grasped by its\r\nseveral members, the large majority of the numerous persons who have\r\nbeen eminent above their far more numerous fellows, each in his own\r\nspecial department, being unknown to the generality. The merits of\r\nsuch men can be justly appreciated only by reference to records of\r\ntheir achievements. Let no reader be so conceited as to believe his\r\npresent ignorance of a particular person to be a proof that the\r\nperson in question does not merit the title of noteworthy.\r\n\r\nI said what I have to say about the modern use of the word \"genius\"\r\nin the preface to the second edition of my \"Hereditary Genius.\" It\r\nhas only latterly lost its old and usual meaning, which is preserved\r\nin the term of an \"ingenious\" artisan, and has come to be applied to\r\nsomething akin to inspiration. This simply means, as I suppose,\r\nthough some may think differently, that the powers of unconscious\r\nwork possessed by the brain are abnormally developed in them. The\r\nheredity of these powers has not, I believe, been as yet especially\r\nstudied. It is strange that more attention has not been given until\r\nrecently to unconscious brain-work, because it is by far the most\r\npotent factor in mental operations. Few people, when in rapid\r\nconversation, have the slightest idea of the particular form which a\r\nsentence will assume into which they have hurriedly plunged, yet\r\nthrough the guidance of unconscious cerebration it develops itself\r\ngrammatically and harmoniously. I write on good authority in\r\nasserting that the best speaking and writing is that which seems to\r\nflow automatically shaped out of a full mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.--PROPORTION OF NOTEWORTHIES TO THE GENERALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe materials on which the subject of this chapter depends are too\r\nvarious to lead to a single definite and trustworthy answer. Men who\r\nhave won their way to the front out of uncongenial environments owe\r\ntheir success principally, I believe, to their untiring energy, and\r\nto an exceptionally strong inclination in youth towards the pursuits\r\nin which they afterwards distinguished themselves. They do not seem\r\noften to be characterized by an ability that continues pre-eminent on\r\na wider stage, because after they have fully won a position for\r\nthemselves, and become engaged in work along with others who had no\r\nearly difficulties to contend with, they do not, as a rule, show\r\ngreatly higher natural ability than their colleagues. This is\r\nnoticeable in committees and in other assemblies or societies where\r\nintellects are pitted against one another. The bulk of existing\r\nnoteworthies seem to have had but little more than a fair education\r\nas small boys, during which their eagerness and aptitude for study\r\nled to their receiving favour and facilities. If, in such cases, the\r\naptitudes are scholastic, a moderate sum suffices to give the boy a\r\nbetter education, enabling him to win scholarships and to enter a\r\nUniversity. If they lie in other directions, the boy attracts notice\r\nfrom some more congenial source, and is helped onwards in life by\r\nother means. The demand for exceptional ability, when combined with\r\nenergy and good character, is so great that a lad who is gifted with\r\nthem is hardly more likely to remain overlooked than a bird's nest in\r\nthe playground of a school. But, by whatever means noteworthiness\r\nis achieved, it is usually after a course of repeated and\r\nhalf-unconscious testings of intelligence, energy, and character,\r\nwhich build up repute brick by brick.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the number of those who achieved noteworthiness through\r\ntheir own exertions with the numbers of the greatly more numerous\r\npersons whose names are registered in legal, clerical, medical,\r\nofficial, military, and naval directories, or in those of the titled\r\nclasses[A] and landed gentry, or lastly, of those of the immense\r\ncommercial world, the proportion of one noteworthy person to one\r\nhundred of the generality who were equally well circumstanced as\r\nhimself does not seem to be an over-estimate.\r\n\r\n[A] By a rough count of the entries in Burke's \"Peerage, Baronetage\r\n    and Knightage,\" I find that upwards of 24,000 ladies are of\r\n    sufficient rank to be included by name in his Table of\r\n    Precedence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.--NOTEWORTHINESS AS A MEASURE OF ABILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccess is the joint result of the natural powers of mind and body,\r\nand of favourable circumstances. Those of the latter which fall into\r\ndefinite groups will be distinguished as \"environment,\" while the\r\nothers, which evade classification, will be called \"accidental.\"\r\n\r\nThe superstitions of old times cling so tenaciously to modern thought\r\nthat the words \"accident\" and \"chance\" commonly connote some\r\nmysterious agency. Nothing of the kind is implied here. The word\r\n\"accident\" and the like is used in these pages simply to express the\r\neffect of unknown or unnoted causes, without the slightest\r\nimplication that they are unknowable. In most cases their neglect has\r\nbeen partly due to their individual insignificance, though their\r\ncombined effect may be very powerful when a multitude work in the\r\nsame direction. Moreover, a trifling pressure at the right spot\r\nsuffices to release a hair-trigger and thereby to cause an explosion;\r\nsimilarly, with personal and social events, a trifling accident will\r\nsometimes determine a career.\r\n\r\nNoteworthiness and success may be regarded statistically as the\r\noutcome of ability and environment and of nothing else, because the\r\neffects of chance tend to be eliminated by statistical treatment. The\r\nquestion then becomes, How far may noteworthiness be accepted as a\r\nstatistical measure of ability?\r\n\r\nAbility and environment are each composed of many elements that\r\ndiffer greatly in character. Ability may be especially strong in\r\nparticular directions as in administration, art, scholarship, or\r\nscience; it is, nevertheless, so adaptive that an able man has often\r\nfound his way to the front under more than one great change of\r\ncircumstance. The force that impels towards noteworthy deeds is an\r\ninnate disposition in some men, depending less on circumstances than\r\nin others. They are like ships that carry an auxiliary steam-power,\r\ncapable of moving in a dead calm and against adverse winds. Others\r\nare like the ordinary sailing ships of the present day--they are\r\nstationary in a calm, but can make some way towards their destination\r\nunder almost any wind. Without a stimulus of some kind these men are\r\nidle, but almost any kind of stimulus suffices to set them in action.\r\nOthers, again, are like Arab dhows, that do little more than drift\r\nbefore the monsoon or other wind; but then they go fast.\r\n\r\nEnvironment is a more difficult topic to deal with, because\r\nconditions that are helpful to success in one pursuit may be\r\ndetrimental in another. High social rank and wealth conduce to\r\nsuccess in political life, but their distractions and claims clash\r\nwith quiet investigation. Successes are of the most varied\r\ndescriptions, but those registered in this book are confined to such\r\nas are reputed honourable, and are not obviously due to favour.\r\n\r\nIn attacking the problem it therefore becomes necessary to fix the\r\nattention, in the first instance, upon the members of some one large,\r\nspecial profession, as upon artists, leaders in commerce,\r\ninvestigators, scholars, warriors, and so forth, then to divide these\r\ninto subclasses, until more appears to be lost through paucity of\r\nmaterial than is gained through its increasing homogeneity.\r\n\r\nWhatever group be selected, both ability and environment must be\r\nrated according to the requirements of that group. It then becomes\r\npossible, and it is not difficult, to roughly array individuals under\r\neach of these two heads successively, and to label every person with\r\nletters signifying his place in either class. For purposes of the\r\nfollowing explanation, each quality will be distributed into three\r\ngrades, determined not by value, but by class place--namely, the\r\nhighest third, the medium third, and the lowest third. In respect to\r\nability, these classes will be called A, B, and C. In respect to\r\nenvironment, the grades will refer to its helpfulness towards the\r\nparticular success achieved, and the classes will be called E, F, G.\r\nIt must be clearly understood that the differences between the grades\r\ndo not profess to be equal, merely that A is higher than B, and B\r\nthan C; similarly as to E, F, and G. The A, B, C may be quite\r\nindependent of E, F, G, or they may be correlated. Both cases will\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\nAbility and Environment being mutually helpful towards success, the\r\nsuccesses statistically associated with AE will be reckoned higher\r\nthan those associated with AF. Again, for simplicity of explanation\r\nonly, it will here be assumed that Ability and Environment are\r\nequally potent in securing success. Any other reasonable relation\r\nbetween their influences may be substituted for the purpose of\r\nexperiment, but the ultimate conclusion will be much the same.\r\n\r\n          TABLE I.--COMBINATIONS OF ABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n             +-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n             |  AE.

These tabular entries fall into\r\nthree equal groups. The three that lie in and about the upper\r\nleft-hand corner contain the highest constituents--namely, either\r\n_high_ combined with _high_, or one _high_ with one _medium_. They\r\nproduce Successes of Grade I. The three in the middle diagonal band\r\nrunning between the lower left and the upper right corners are either\r\none _high_ and one _low_, or both are _medium_; they will produce\r\nSuccesses of Grade II. The three in and about the right-hand corner\r\nare either one _medium_ with one _low_, or both are _low_; they will\r\nproduce Successes of Grade III. This is still more clearly seen by\r\nsorting the results into Table II., from which it is clear that a\r\nhigh grade of Success is statistically associated with a high, but\r\nless, grade of Ability, a medium with a medium, and a low grade of\r\nSuccess with a low, but less low, grade of Ability.\r\n\r\n            TABLE II.--ABILITY INDEPENDENT OF ENVIRONMENT.\r\n _____________________________________________________________________\r\n|           |                             |                           |\r\n| Grades of |                             |                           |\r\n| Success.  | Contributory Combinations.  |  Corresponding Abilities. |\r\n|___________|_____________________________|___________________________|\r\n|           |         |         |         |         |        |        |\r\n|     I.    |   AE    |   AF    |   BE    | 2 of A  | 1 of B |   --   |\r\n|    II.    |   AG    |   BF    |   CE    | 1 of A  | 1 of B | 1 of C |\r\n|   III.    |   CG    |   BG    |   CF    |   --    | 1 of B | 2 of C |\r\n|___________|_________|_________|_________|_________|________|________|\r\n\r\nSecondly, suppose A, B, C to be correlated with E, F, G, so that A is\r\nmore likely to be associated with E than it is with F, and much more\r\nlikely than with G. Similarly, C is most likely to be associated with\r\nG, less likely with F, and least likely with E. The general effect of\r\nthese preferences will be well represented by divorcing the couples\r\nwhich differ by two grades--namely, AG and CE, by re-mating their\r\nconstituents as AE and CG, and by re-sorting them, as in Table III.\r\nThe couples that differ by no more than one grade are left\r\nundisturbed. The results now fall into five grades of Success, in\r\nfour of which each grade contains two-ninths of the whole number, and\r\none, the medium Grade 3, contains only one-ninth.\r\n\r\nAs remarked previously, the grades are not supposed to be separated\r\nby equal steps. They are numbered in ordinary numerals to distinguish\r\nthem from those in Table II.\r\n\r\n            TABLE III.--ABILITY CORRELATED WITH ENVIRONMENT.\r\n _____________________________________________________________________\r\n|                    |               |                                |\r\n| Grades of Success. | Contributory  |    Corresponding Abilities.    |\r\n|                    | Combinations. |                                |\r\n|____________________|_______________|________________________________|\r\n|                    |       |       |          |          |          |\r\n| 1                  |  AE   |  AE   |  2 of A  |    --    |    --    |\r\n| 2                  |  AF   |  BE   |  1 of A  |  1 of B  |    --    |\r\n| 3                  |  BF   |  --   |    --    |  1 of B  |    --    |\r\n| 4                  |  BG   |  CF   |    --    |  1 of B  |  1 of C  |\r\n| 5                  |  CG   |  CG   |    --    |    --    |  2 of C  |\r\n|____________________|_______|_______|__________|__________|__________|\r\n\r\nIt clearly appears from this table that the effect of correlation\r\nbetween Ability and Environment is to increase, and not to diminish,\r\nthe closeness of association between Success and Ability. Indeed, if\r\nthe correlation were perfect, Success would become an equal measure\r\n_both_ of Ability and of Favourableness of Environment.\r\n\r\nThese arguments are true for each and every branch of Success, and\r\nare therefore true for all: Ability being construed as Appropriate\r\nAbility, and Environment as Appropriate Environment.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion is that Success is, statistically speaking, a\r\nmagnified, but otherwise trustworthy, sign of Ability, high Success\r\nbeing associated with high, but not an equally high, grade of\r\nAbility, and low with low, but not an equally low. A few instances to\r\nthe contrary no more contradict this important general conclusion\r\nthan a few cases of death at very early or at very late ages\r\ncontradict the tables of expectation of life of a newly-born infant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.--NOMENCLATURE OF KINSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific kinships are such as \"paternal uncle\" or \"maternal uncle,\"\r\nas distinguished from the general term \"uncle.\" The phrase \"first\r\ncousin\" covers no less than eight specific kinships (four male and\r\nfour female), not taking the issue of mixed marriages into account.\r\nSpecific kinships are briefly expressed by a nomenclature in which\r\n_fa_, _me_, _bro_, _si_, _son_, _da_, _Hu_, _Wi_, stand respectively\r\nfor _father_, _mother_, _brother_, _sister_, _son_, _daughter_,\r\n_Husband_, _Wife_. Each of these syllables is supposed to have the\r\npossessive _'s_ added to it whenever it is followed by another\r\nsyllable of the set, or by the word _is_ when it is not. _Example_:\r\nLet the person from whom the kinships are reckoned be called _P_, and\r\nlet _Q_ and _R_ be two of _P_'s kinsfolk, described respectively as\r\n_fa bro_ and _me si son_. That means that _P's father's brother_ is\r\n_Q_, and that _P's mother's sister's son_ is _R_. It is a simple and\r\neasily intelligible nomenclature, and replaces intolerable verbiage\r\nin the description of distant kinships. My correspondents used it\r\nfreely, and none of them spoke of any difficulty in understanding it.\r\nIts somewhat babyish sound is soon disregarded.\r\n\r\n                       TABLE IV.--ABBREVIATIONS.\r\n ______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                                 |                                    |\r\n|              Males.             |              Females.              |\r\n|_________________________________|____________________________________|\r\n|                                 |                                    |\r\n| Grandfather, paternal   _fa fa_ | Grandmother, paternal      _fa me_ |\r\n|     \"        maternal   _me fa_ |     \"        maternal      _me me_ |\r\n| Father                     _fa_ | Mother                        _me_ |\r\n| Uncle, paternal        _fa bro_ | Aunt, paternal             _fa si_ |\r\n|   \"    maternal        _me bro_ |   \"   maternal             _me si_ |\r\n|                                 |                                    |\r\n| Brother                   _bro_ | Sister                        _si_ |\r\n|                                 |                                    |\r\n| Son                       _son_ | Daughter                      _da_ |\r\n| Nephew, brother's son _bro son_ | Niece, brother's daughter _bro da_ |\r\n| Nephew, sister's son   _si son_ | Niece, sister's daughter   _si da_ |\r\n|                                 |                                    |\r\n| Male first cousins:             | Female first cousins:              |\r\n|  1.

The counters are linked\r\ntogether by bands of various widths, down to mere threads, the widths\r\nbeing proportional to the closeness of the several kinships. Those in\r\nthe first degree (_father_, _mother_, _brother_, _sister_, _son_,\r\n_daughter_) are comparatively broad; those in the second degree\r\n(_grandparent_, _uncle_, _aunt_, _nephew_, _niece_, _grandchild_) are\r\nconsiderably narrower; those in the third degree are very narrow\r\nindeed. Proceeding outwards, the connections soon become thinner than\r\ngossamer. The person represented by any one of these counters may be\r\ntaken as the subject of a pedigree, and all the counters connected\r\nwith it may be noted up to any specified width of band. In this book\r\none of the counters is supposed to represent a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety, whose name appears in the \"Year-Book\" of that Society for\r\n1904, and the linkage proceeds outwards from him to the third degree\r\ninclusive. Usually it stops there, but a few distant kinships have\r\nbeen occasionally inserted chiefly to testify to a prolonged\r\nheritage of family traits.\r\n\r\nThe intensity with which any specified quality occurs in each or any\r\ndegree of kinship is measured by the proportion between the numbers\r\nof those who possess the quality in question and the total number of\r\npersons in that same degree. Particular inquiries were made on the\r\nlatter point, but, as already stated, the answers were incomplete.\r\nThere is, however, enough information to justify three conclusions of\r\nprimary importance to the present inquiry--namely, the _average_\r\nnumber (1) of brothers of the subject, (2) of brothers of his father,\r\nand (3) of brothers of his mother.\r\n\r\nThe number of Fellows to whom circulars were addressed was 467. The\r\nnumber of those who gave useful replies was 207, a little more than\r\none-half of whom sent complete returns of the numbers of their\r\nbrothers and uncles; some few of these had, however, placed a query\r\nhere or there, or other sign of hesitation. As the number of\r\ncompletely available returns scarcely exceeded 100, I have confined\r\nthe following tables to that number exactly, taking the best of the\r\nslightly doubtful cases. It would have been possible, by utilizing\r\npartial returns and making due allowances, to have obtained nearly\r\nhalf as many again, but the gain in numbers did not seem likely to be\r\ncompensated by the somewhat inferior quality of the additional data.\r\n\r\nThe first three lines of Table V. show that there is no significant\r\ndifference between the average numbers of brothers and sisters, nor\r\nbetween those of fathers' brothers and fathers' sisters, nor again\r\nbetween those of mothers' brothers and mothers' sisters; nor is there\r\nany large difference between those of male and female cousins, but it\r\nis apparently a fact that the group of \"brothers\" is a trifle smaller\r\nthan that of uncles on either side. It seems, therefore, that the\r\ngeneration of the Subjects contains a somewhat smaller number of\r\nindividuals than that of either of their Parents, being to that\r\nextent significant of a lessening population so far as their class is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n       TABLE V.--NUMBER OF KINSFOLK IN ONE HUNDRED FAMILIES WHO\r\n                           SURVIVED CHILDHOOD.\r\n ______________________________________________________________________\r\n|               |               |           |              |           |\r\n| Generic       | Specific      | Number of | Specific     | Number of |\r\n| Kinships.     | Kinships.     | Persons.  | Kinships.    | Persons.  |\r\n|_______________|_______________|___________|______________|___________|\r\n|               |               |           |              |           |\r\n|Brothers and   | _bro_         |    206    | _si_         |    207    |\r\n| sisters       |               |           |              |           |\r\n|_______________|_______________|___________|______________|___________|\r\n|               |               |           |              |           |\r\n|Uncles and     | _fa bro_      |    228    | _fa si_      |    207    |\r\n| aunts         | _me bro_      |    219    | _me si_      |    238    |\r\n|_______________|_______________|___________|______________|___________|\r\n|               |               |           |              |           |\r\n|               | Mean          |    224    | Mean         |    223    |\r\n|_______________|_______________|___________|______________|___________|\r\n|               |               |           |              |           |\r\n|First cousins, | _fa bro son_  |    265    | _fa bro da_  |    302    |\r\n| male and      | _fa si son_   |    184    | _fa si da_   |    208    |\r\n| female        | _me bro son_  |    236    | _me bro da_  |    266    |\r\n|               | _me si son_   |    237    | _me si da_   |    246    |\r\n|_______________|_______________|___________|______________|___________|\r\n\r\nIt may seem at first sight surprising that a brother and a sister\r\nshould each have the same average number of brothers. It puzzled me\r\nuntil I had thought the matter out, and when the results were\r\npublished in \"Nature,\" it also seems to have puzzled an able\r\nmathematician, and gave rise to some newspaper controversy, which\r\nneed not be recapitulated. The essence of the problem is that the sex\r\nof one child is supposed to give no clue of any practical importance\r\nto that of any other child in the same family. Therefore, if one\r\nchild be selected out of a family of brothers and sisters, the\r\nproportion of males to females in those that remain will be, _on the\r\naverage_, identical with that of males to females in the population\r\nat large. It makes no difference whether the selected child be a boy\r\nor a girl. Of course, if the conditions were \"given a family of three\r\nboys and three girls,\" each boy would have only two brothers and\r\nthree sisters, and each girl would have three brothers and two\r\nsisters, but that is not the problem.\r\n\r\nSubject to this explanation, the general accuracy of the observed\r\nfigures which attest the truth of the above conclusion cannot be\r\ngainsaid on theoretical grounds, nor can the conclusions be ignored\r\nto which they lead. They enable us to make calculations concerning\r\nthe average number of kinsfolk in each and every specified degree in\r\na stationary population, or, if desired, in one that increases or\r\ndecreases at a specified rate. It will here be supposed for\r\nconvenience that the average number of males and females are equal,\r\nbut any other proportion may be substituted. The calculations only\r\nregard its fertile members; they show that every person has, on the\r\naverage, about one male fertile relative in each and every form of\r\nspecific kinship.\r\n\r\nKinsfolk may be divided into direct ancestry, collaterals of all\r\nkinds, and direct descendants. As regards the direct ancestry, each\r\nperson has one and only one ancestor in each specific degree, one\r\n_fa_, one _fa fa_, one _me fa_, and so on, although in each _generic_\r\ndegree it is otherwise; he has two grandfathers, four\r\ngreat-grandfathers, etc. With collaterals and descendants the average\r\nnumber of _fertile_ relatives in each specified degree must be\r\nstationary in a stationary population, and calculation shows that\r\nnumber is approximately _one_. The calculation takes no cognizance of\r\ninfertile relatives, and so its results are unaffected by the detail\r\nwhether the population is kept stationary by an increased birth-rate\r\nof children or other infertiles, accompanied by an increased\r\ndeath-rate among them, or contrariwise.\r\n\r\nThe exact conclusions were (\"Nature,\" September 29, 1904, p. 529),\r\nthat if 2_d_ be the number of children in a family, half of them _on\r\nthe average_ being male, and if the population be stationary, the\r\nnumber of fertile males in each specific ancestral kinship would be\r\n_one_, in each collateral it would be _d_-½, in each descending\r\nkinship _d_. If 2_d_ = 5 (which is a common size of family), one of\r\nthese on the average would be a fertile son, one a fertile daughter,\r\nand the three that remained would leave no issue. They would either\r\ndie as boys or girls or they would remain unmarried, or, if married,\r\nwould have no children.\r\n\r\nThe reasonable and approximate assumption I now propose to make is\r\nthat the number of fertile individuals is not grossly different to\r\nthat of those who live long enough to have an opportunity of\r\ndistinguishing themselves. Consequently, the calculations that apply\r\nto fertile persons will be held to apply very roughly to those who\r\nwere in a position, so far as age is concerned, to achieve\r\nnoteworthiness, whether they did so or not. Thus, if a group of 100\r\nmen had between them 20 noteworthy paternal uncles, it will be\r\nassumed that the total number of their paternal uncles who reached\r\nmature age was about 100, making the intensity of success as 20 to\r\n100, or as 1 to 5. This method of roughly evading the serious\r\ndifficulty arising from ignorance of the true values in the\r\nindividual cases is quite legitimate, and close enough for present\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.--NUMBER OF NOTEWORTHY KINSMEN IN EACH DEGREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe materials with which I am dealing do not admit of adequately\r\ndiscussing noteworthiness in women, whose opportunities of achieving\r\ndistinction are far fewer than those of men, and whose energies are\r\nmore severely taxed by domestic and social duties. Women have\r\nsometimes been accredited in these returns by a member of their own\r\nfamily circle, as being gifted with powers at least equal to those of\r\ntheir distinguished brothers, but definite facts in corroboration of\r\nsuch estimates were rarely supplied.\r\n\r\nThe same absence of solid evidence is more or less true of gifted\r\nyouths whose scholastic successes, unless of the highest order, are a\r\ndoubtful indication of future power and performance, these depending\r\nmuch on the length of time during which their minds will continue to\r\ndevelop. Only a few of the Subjects of the pedigrees in the following\r\npages have sons in the full maturity of their powers, so it seemed\r\nsafer to exclude all relatives who were of a lower generation than\r\nthemselves from the statistical inquiry. This will therefore be\r\nconfined to the successes of fathers, brothers, grandfathers, uncles,\r\ngreat-uncles, great-grandfathers, and male first cousins.\r\n\r\nOnly 207 persons out of the 467 who were addressed sent serviceable\r\nreplies, and these cannot be considered a fair sample of the whole.\r\nAbstention might have been due to dislike of publicity, to inertia,\r\nor to pure ignorance, none of which would have much affected the\r\nvalues as a sample; but an unquestionably common motive does so\r\nseriously--namely, when the person addressed had no noteworthy\r\nkinsfolk to write about. On the latter ground the 260 who did not\r\nreply would, as a whole, be poorer in noteworthy kinsmen than the 207\r\nwho did. The true percentages for the 467 lie between two limits:\r\nthe upper limit supposes the richness of the 207 to be shared by the\r\n260; the lower limit supposes it to be concentrated in the 207, the\r\nremaining 260 being utterly barren of it. Consequently, the upper\r\nlimit is found by multiplying the number of observations by 100 and\r\ndividing by 207, the lower by multiplying by 100 and dividing by 467.\r\nThese limits are unreasonably wide; I cannot guess which is the more\r\nremote from the truth, but it cannot be far removed from their mean\r\nvalues, and this may be accepted as roughly approximate. The\r\nobservations and conclusions from them are given in Table VII., p. xl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.--MARKED AND UNMARKED DEGREES OF NOTEWORTHINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersons who are technically \"noteworthy\" are by no means of equal\r\neminence, some being of the highest distinction, while others barely\r\ndeserve the title. It is therefore important to ascertain the amount\r\nof error to which a statistical discussion is liable that treats\r\neveryone who ranks as noteworthy at all on equal terms. The problem\r\nresembles a familiar one that relates to methods for electing\r\nParliamentary representatives, such as have been proposed at various\r\ntimes, whether it should be by the coarse method of one man one vote,\r\nor through some elaborate arrangement which seems highly preferable\r\nat first sight, but may be found on further consideration to lead to\r\nmuch the same results.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the question, I marked each noteworthy person whose\r\nname occurs in the list of sixty-six families at the end of this book\r\nwith 3, 2, or 1, according to what I considered his deserts, and soon\r\nfound that it was easy to mark them with fair consistency. It is not\r\nnecessary to give the rules which guided me, as they were very often\r\nmodified by considerations, each obvious enough in itself, but\r\ndifficult to summarize as a whole. Various provisional trials were\r\nmade; I then began afresh by rejecting a few names as undeserving any\r\nmark at all, and, having marked the remainder individually, found\r\nthat a total of 657 marks had been awarded to 332 persons; 117 of\r\nthem had received 3 marks; 101, 2 marks; 104, 1 mark; so the three\r\nsubdivisions were approximately equal in number. The marks being too\r\nfew to justify detailed treatment, I have grouped the kinsmen into\r\nfirst, second, and third degrees, and into first cousins, the latter\r\nrequiring a group to themselves. The first degree contains father and\r\nbrothers; the second, grandfathers and uncles; the third,\r\ngreat-grandparents and great-uncles. The results are shown in Table\r\nVI. The marks assigned to each of the groups are given in the first\r\nline (total 657), and the number of the noteworthy persons in each\r\ngroup who received any mark at all is shown in the third line (total\r\n329). In order to compare the first and third lines of entries on\r\nequal terms, those in the first were multiplied by 329 and divided by\r\n657, and then entered in the second line. The closeness of\r\nresemblance between the second and third lines emphatically answers\r\nthe question to be solved. There is no significant difference between\r\nthe results of the marked and the unmarked observations. The reason\r\nprobably is that the distribution of triple, double, and single marks\r\nseparately is much the same in each of the groups, and therefore\r\nremains alike when the three sets of marks are in use at the same\r\ntime. It is thus made clear that trouble taken in carefully marking\r\nnames for different degrees of noteworthiness would be wasted in such\r\na rough inquiry as this.\r\n\r\n          TABLE VI.--COMPARISON OF RESULTS WITH AND WITHOUT\r\n                  MARKS IN THE SIXTY-FIVE FAMILIES.\r\n ___________________________________________________________________\r\n|                      |        |        |        |         |       |\r\n|                      | First  | Second | Third  | First   | Total |\r\n|                      | Degree.| Degree.| Degree.| Cousins.|       |\r\n|______________________|________|________|________|_________|_______|\r\n|                      |        |        |        |         |       |\r\n|Number of marks       |   225  |  208   |   102  |   122   |  657  |\r\n|   assigned           |        |        |        |         |       |\r\n|______________________|________|________|________|_________|_______|\r\n|                      |        |        |        |         |       |\r\n|Number of marks       |        |        |        |         |       |\r\n|  reduced             |        |        |        |         |       |\r\n|  proportionately     |   113  |  104   |    51  |    61   |  329  |\r\n|Number of individuals |        |        |        |         |       |\r\n|  unmarked            |   110  |  112   |    46  |    61   |  329  |\r\n|______________________|________|________|________|_________|_______|\r\n|                      |        |        |        |         |       |\r\n|     Mean             |   111  |  108   |    49  |    61   |  329  |\r\n|______________________|________|________|________|_________|_______|\r\n\r\nTable VII., in the next chapter, affords an interesting illustration\r\nof the character of the ignorance concerning the noteworthiness of\r\nkinsmen in distant degrees, showing that it is much lessened when\r\nthey bear the same surname as their father, or even as the maiden\r\nsurname of their mother. The argument is this: Table V. has already\r\nshown that _me bros_ are, speaking roughly, as frequently noteworthy\r\nas _fa bros_--fifty-two of the one to forty-five of the other--so\r\nnoteworthiness is so far an equal characteristic of the maternal and\r\npaternal lines, resembling in that respect nearly all the qualities\r\nthat are transmitted purely through heredity. There ought, therefore,\r\nto be as many persons recorded as noteworthy in each of the four\r\ndifferent kinds of great-grandparents. The same should be the case in\r\neach of the four kinds of great-uncles. But this is not so in either\r\ncase. The noteworthy great-grandfathers, _fa fa fa_, who bear the\r\nsame name as the subject are twice as numerous as the _me fa fa_ who\r\nbear the maiden surname of the mother, and more than five times as\r\nnumerous as either of the other two, the _fa me fa_ and _me me fa_,\r\nwhose surnames differ from both, unless it be through some accident,\r\nwhether of a cross marriage or a chance similarity of names. It is\r\njust the same with the great-uncles. Now, the figures for\r\ngreat-grandfathers and great-uncles run so closely alike that they\r\nmay fairly be grouped together, in order to obtain a more impressive\r\nwhole--namely, two sorts of these kinsmen, bearing the same name as\r\nthe Subject, contain between them 23 noteworthies, or 11.50 each; two\r\nsorts having the mother's maiden surname contain together 11\r\nnoteworthies, or 5.50 each; four sorts containing between them 7\r\nnames, or an average of 1.75 each. These figures are self-consistent,\r\nbeing each the sum of two practically equal constituents, and they\r\nare sufficiently numerous to be significant. The remarkable\r\ndifferences in their numbers, 11.50, 5.50, 1.75, when they ought to\r\nhave been equal, has therefore to be accounted for, and the\r\nexplanation given above seems both reasonable and sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.--CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most casual glance at Table VII. leaves no doubt as to the rapid\r\ndiminution in the frequency of noteworthiness as the distance of\r\nkinship to the F.R.S. increases, and it would presumably do the same\r\nto any other class of noteworthy persons.\r\n\r\nIn drawing more exact conclusions, the returns must be deemed to\r\nrefer not to a group of 207 F.R.S., because they are not a fair\r\nsample of the whole body of 467, and, for reasons already given, they\r\nare too rich in noteworthiness for the one and too poor for the\r\nother. They will, therefore, be referred to the number that is the\r\nmean of these two limits--namely, to 337. I am aware of no obvious\r\nguidance to any better hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe value of the expectation that noteworthiness would be found in\r\nany specified kinsman of an F.R.S., of whom nothing else is known,\r\nmay be easily calculated from Table VII. on the two hypotheses\r\nalready mentioned and justified: (1) That the figures should be taken\r\nto refer to 337, and not to 207; (2) that 1 per cent. of the\r\ngenerality are noteworthy--that is to say, there are 3.37\r\nnoteworthies to every 337 persons of the generality.\r\n\r\n          TABLE VII.--NUMBER OF NOTEWORTHY KINSMEN RECORDED\r\n                            IN 207 RETURNS.\r\n      __________________________________________________________\r\n     |                 |          ||                |           |\r\n     |    Kinship.     | Numbers  ||   Kinship.     | Numbers   |\r\n     |                 | Recorded.||                | Recorded. |\r\n     |_________________|__________||________________| __________|\r\n     |                 |          ||                |           |\r\n     | _fa_            |    81    ||      ---       |    ---    |\r\n     | _bro_           |   104    ||      ---       |    ---    |\r\n     |                 |          ||                |           |\r\n     | _fa fa_         |    40    ||  _fa fa fa_    |     11    |\r\n     | _me fa_         |    42    ||  _fa me fa_    |      2    |\r\n     | _fa bro_        |    45    ||  _me fa fa_    |      5    |\r\n     | _me bro_        |    52    ||  _me me fa_    |      1    |\r\n     |                 |          ||                |           |\r\n     | _fa bro son_    |    30    ||  _fa fa bro_   |     12    |\r\n     | _me bro son_    |    19    ||  _fa me bro_   |      2    |\r\n     | _fa si son_     |    28    ||  _me fa bro_   |      6    |\r\n     | _me si son_     |    22    ||  _me me bro_   |      2    |\r\n     |_________________|__________||________________|___________|\r\n\r\nThus, for the fathers of F.R.S., 81 are recorded as noteworthy,\r\nagainst 3.37 of fathers of the generality--that is, they are 24.1\r\ntimes as numerous. For the first cousins of F.R.S. there are 99\r\nnoteworthies, divided amongst four kinds of male first-cousins, or\r\n24.75 on an average to each kind, against the 3.37 of the\r\ngenerality--that is, they are 7.3 times as numerous.\r\n\r\nOn this principle the expectation of noteworthiness in a kinsman of\r\nan F.R.S. (or of other noteworthy person) is greater in the following\r\nproportion than in one who has no such kinsman: If he be a father, 24\r\ntimes as great; if a brother, 31 times; if a grandfather, 12 times;\r\nif an uncle, 14 times; if a male first cousin, 7 times; if a\r\ngreat-great-grandfather on the paternal line, 3½ times.\r\n\r\nThe reader may work out results for himself on other hypotheses as to\r\nthe percentage of noteworthiness among the generality. A considerably\r\nlarger proportion would be noteworthy in the higher classes of\r\nsociety, but a far smaller one in the lower; it is to the bulk, say,\r\nto three-quarters of them, that the 1 per cent. estimate applies, the\r\nextreme variations from it tending to balance one another.\r\n\r\nThe figures on which the above calculations depend may each or all of\r\nthem be changed to any reasonable amount, without shaking the truth\r\nof the great fact upon which Eugenics is based, that able fathers\r\nproduce able children in a much larger proportion than the\r\ngenerality.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe parents of the 207 Fellows of the Royal Society occupy a wide\r\nvariety of social positions. A list is given in the Appendix of the\r\nmore or less noteworthy parents of those Fellows whose names occur in\r\nthe list of sixty-six families. The parents are classified according\r\nto their pursuits. Many parents of the other Fellows in the 207\r\nfamilies were not noteworthy in the technical sense of the word, but\r\nwere reported to be able. It was also often said in the replies that\r\nthe general level of ability among the members of the family of the\r\nF.R.S. was high. Other parents were in no way remarkable, so the\r\nfuture Fellow was simply a \"sport,\" to use the language of\r\nhorticulturists and breeders, in respect to his taste and ability. It\r\nis to be remembered that \"sports\" are transmissible by heredity, and\r\nhave been, through careful selection, the origin of most of the\r\nvaluable varieties of domesticated plants and animals. Sports have\r\nbeen conspicuous in the human race, especially in some individuals of\r\nthe highest eminence in music, painting, and in art generally, but\r\nthis is not the place to enter further into so large a subject. It\r\nhas been treated at length by many writers, especially by Bateson and\r\nDe Vries, also by myself in the third chapter of \"Natural\r\nInheritance\" and in the preface to the second edition of \"Hereditary\r\nGenius.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTEWORTHY FAMILIES OF\r\n\r\nFELLOWS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY\r\n\r\nLIVING IN 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#AVEBURY#, Lord.
