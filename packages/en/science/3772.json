tenth\r\nedition of my “Principles of Geology.”\r\n\r\nIn writing the last-mentioned work I had been called upon to pass in\r\nreview almost all the leading points of speculation and controversy to\r\nwhich the rapid advance of the science had given rise, and when I\r\nproposed to bring out a new edition of the “Elements” I was strongly\r\nurged by my friends not to repeat these theoretical discussions, but to\r\nconfine myself in the new treatise to those parts of the “Elements”\r\nwhich were most indispensable to a beginner. This was to revert, to a\r\ncertain extent, to the original plan of the first edition; but I found,\r\nafter omitting a great number of subjects, that the necessity of\r\nbringing up to the day those which remained, and adverting, however\r\nbriefly, to new discoveries, made it most difficult to confine the\r\nproposed abridgment within moderate limits. Some chapters had to be\r\nentirely recast, some additional illustrations to be introduced, and\r\nfigures of some organic remains to be replaced by new ones from\r\nspecimens more perfect than those which had been at my command on\r\nformer occasions. By these changes the work assumed a form so different\r\nfrom the sixth edition of the “Elements,” that I resolved to give it a\r\nnew title and call it the “Student’s Elements of Geology.”\r\n\r\nIn executing this task I have found it very difficult to meet the\r\nrequirements of those who are entirely ignorant of the science. It is\r\nonly the adept who has already overcome the first steps as an observer,\r\nand is familiar with many of the technical terms, who can profit by a\r\nbrief and concise manual. Beginners wish for a short and cheap book in\r\nwhich they may find a full explanation of the leading facts and\r\nprinciples of Geology. Their wants, I fear, somewhat resemble those of\r\nthe old woman in New England, who asked a bookseller to supply her with\r\n“the cheapest Bible in the largest possible print.”\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the difficulty of reconciling brevity with the\r\ncopiousness of illustration demanded by those who have not yet mastered\r\nthe rudiments of the science, I have endeavoured to abridge the work in\r\nthe manner above hinted at, so as to place it within the reach of many\r\nto whom it was before inaccessible.\r\n\r\nCHARLES LYELL.\r\n\r\n73 HARLEY STREET, LONDON,\r\n_December_, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nON THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology defined. — Successive Formation of the Earth’s Crust. —\r\nClassification of Rocks according to their Origin and Age. — Aqueous\r\nRocks. — Their Stratification and imbedded Fossils. — Volcanic Rocks,\r\nwith and without Cones and Craters. — Plutonic Rocks, and their\r\nRelation to the Volcanic. — Metamorphic Rocks, and their probable\r\nOrigin. — The term Primitive, why erroneously applied to the\r\nCrystalline Formations. — Leading Division of the Work.\r\n\r\nOf what materials is the earth composed, and in what manner are these\r\nmaterials arranged? These are the first inquiries with which Geology is\r\noccupied, a science which derives its name from the Greek _ge_, the\r\nearth, and _logos_, a discourse. Previously to experience we might have\r\nimagined that investigations of this kind would relate exclusively to\r\nthe mineral kingdom, and to the various rocks, soils, and metals, which\r\noccur upon the surface of the earth, or at various depths beneath it.\r\nBut, in pursuing such researches, we soon find ourselves led on to\r\nconsider the successive changes which have taken place in the former\r\nstate of the earth’s surface and interior, and the causes which have\r\ngiven rise to these changes; and, what is still more singular and\r\nunexpected, we soon become engaged in researches into the history of\r\nthe animate creation, or of the various tribes of animals and plants\r\nwhich have, at different periods of the past, inhabited the globe.\r\n\r\nAll are aware that the solid parts of the earth consist of distinct\r\nsubstances, such as clay, chalk, sand, limestone, coal, slate, granite,\r\nand the like; but previously to observation it is commonly imagined\r\nthat all these had remained from the first in the state in which we now\r\nsee them—that they were created in their present form, and in their\r\npresent position. The geologist soon comes to a different conclusion,\r\ndiscovering proofs that the external parts of the earth were not all\r\nproduced in the beginning of things in the state in which we now behold\r\nthem, nor in an instant of time. On the contrary, he can show that they\r\nhave acquired their actual configuration and condition gradually, under\r\na great variety of circumstances, and at successive periods, during\r\neach of which distinct races of living beings have flourished on the\r\nland and in the waters, the remains of these creatures still lying\r\nburied in the crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nBy the “earth’s crust,” is meant that small portion of the exterior of\r\nour planet which is accessible to human observation. It comprises not\r\nmerely all of which the structure is laid open in mountain precipices,\r\nor in cliffs overhanging a river or the sea, or whatever the miner may\r\nreveal in artificial excavations; but the whole of that outer covering\r\nof the planet on which we are enabled to reason by observations made at\r\nor near the surface. These reasonings may extend to a depth of several\r\nmiles, perhaps ten miles; and even then it may be said, that such a\r\nthickness is no more than 1/400 part of the distance from the surface\r\nto the centre. The remark is just: but although the dimensions of such\r\na crust are, in truth, insignificant when compared to the entire globe,\r\nyet they are vast, and of magnificent extent in relation to man, and to\r\nthe organic beings which people our globe. Referring to this standard\r\nof magnitude, the geologist may admire the ample limits of his domain,\r\nand admit, at the same time, that not only the exterior of the planet,\r\nbut the entire earth, is but an atom in the midst of the countless\r\nworlds surveyed by the astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe materials of this crust are not thrown together confusedly; but\r\ndistinct mineral masses, called rocks, are found to occupy definite\r\nspaces, and to exhibit a certain order of arrangement. The term _rock_\r\nis applied indifferently by geologists to all these substances, whether\r\nthey be soft or stony, for clay and sand are included in the term, and\r\nsome have even brought peat under this denomination. Our old writers\r\nendeavoured to avoid offering such violence to our language, by\r\nspeaking of the component materials of the earth as consisting of rocks\r\nand _soils._ But there is often so insensible a passage from a soft and\r\nincoherent state to that of stone, that geologists of all countries\r\nhave found it indispensable to have one technical term to include both,\r\nand in this sense we find _roche_ applied in French, _rocca_ in\r\nItalian, and _felsart_ in German. The beginner, however, must\r\nconstantly bear in mind that the term rock by no means implies that a\r\nmineral mass is in an indurated or stony condition.\r\n\r\nThe most natural and convenient mode of classifying the various rocks\r\nwhich compose the earth’s crust, is to refer, in the first place, to\r\ntheir origin, and in the second to their relative age. I shall\r\ntherefore begin by endeavouring briefly to explain to the student how\r\nall rocks may be divided into four great classes by reference to their\r\ndifferent origin, or, in other words, by reference to the different\r\ncircumstances and causes by which they have been produced.\r\n\r\nThe first two divisions, which will at once be understood as natural,\r\nare the aqueous and volcanic, or the products of watery and those of\r\nigneous action at or near the surface.\r\n\r\nAqueous Rocks.—The aqueous rocks, sometimes called the sedimentary, or\r\nfossiliferous, cover a larger part of the earth’s surface than any\r\nothers. They consist chiefly of mechanical deposits (pebbles, sand, and\r\nmud), but are partly of chemical and some of them of organic origin,\r\nespecially the limestones. These rocks are _stratified,_ or divided\r\ninto distinct layers, or strata. The term _stratum_ means simply a bed,\r\nor any thing spread out or _strewed_ over a given surface; and we infer\r\nthat these strata have been generally spread out by the action of\r\nwater, from what we daily see taking place near the mouths of rivers,\r\nor on the land during temporary inundations. For, whenever a running\r\nstream charged with mud or sand, has its velocity checked, as when it\r\nenters a lake or sea, or overflows a plain, the sediment, previously\r\nheld in suspension by the motion of the water, sinks, by its own\r\ngravity to the bottom. In this manner layers of mud and sand are thrown\r\ndown one upon another.\r\n\r\nIf we drain a lake which has been fed by a small stream, we frequently\r\nfind at the bottom a series of deposits, disposed with considerable\r\nregularity, one above the other; the uppermost, perhaps, may be a\r\nstratum of peat, next below a more dense and solid variety of the same\r\nmaterial; still lower a bed of shell-marl, alternating with peat or\r\nsand, and then other beds of marl, divided by layers of clay. Now, if a\r\nsecond pit be sunk through the same continuous lacustrine _formation_\r\nat some distance from the first, nearly the same series of beds is\r\ncommonly met with, yet with slight variations; some, for example, of\r\nthe layers of sand, clay, or marl, may be wanting, one or more of them\r\nhaving thinned out and given place to others, or sometimes one of the\r\nmasses first examined is observed to increase in thickness to the\r\nexclusion of other beds.\r\n\r\nThe term _formation,_ which I have used in the above explanation,\r\nexpresses in geology any assemblage of rocks which have some character\r\nin common, whether of origin, age, or composition. Thus we speak of\r\nstratified and unstratified, fresh-water and marine, aqueous and\r\nvolcanic, ancient and modern, metalliferous and non-metalliferous\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nIn the estuaries of large rivers, such as the Ganges and the\r\nMississippi, we may observe, at low water, phenomena analogous to those\r\nof the drained lakes above mentioned, but on a grander scale, and\r\nextending over areas several hundred miles in length and breadth. When\r\nthe periodical inundations subside, the river hollows out a channel to\r\nthe depth of many yards through horizontal beds of clay and sand, the\r\nends of which are seen exposed in perpendicular cliffs. These beds vary\r\nin their mineral composition, or colour, or in the fineness or\r\ncoarseness of their particles, and some of them are occasionally\r\ncharacterised by containing drift-wood. At the junction of the river\r\nand the sea, especially in lagoons nearly separated by sand-bars from\r\nthe ocean, deposits are often formed in which brackish and salt-water\r\nshells are included.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, where the Nile is always adding to its delta by filling up\r\npart of the Mediterranean with mud, the newly deposited sediment is\r\n_stratified,_ the thin layer thrown down in one season differing\r\nslightly in colour from that of a previous year, and being separable\r\nfrom it, as has been observed in excavations at Cairo and other\r\nplaces.[1]\r\n\r\nWhen beds of sand, clay, and marl, containing shells and vegetable\r\nmatter, are found arranged in a similar manner in the interior of the\r\nearth, we ascribe to them a similar origin; and the more we examine\r\ntheir characters in minute detail, the more exact do we find the\r\nresemblance. Thus, for example, at various heights and depths in the\r\nearth, and often far from seas, lakes, and rivers, we meet with layers\r\nof rounded pebbles composed of flint, limestone, granite, or other\r\nrocks, resembling the shingles of a sea-beach or the gravel in a\r\ntorrent’s bed. Such layers of pebbles frequently alternate with others\r\nformed of sand or fine sediment, just as we may see in the channel of a\r\nriver descending from hills bordering a coast, where the current sweeps\r\ndown at one season coarse sand and gravel, while at another, when the\r\nwaters are low and less rapid, fine mud and sand alone are carried\r\nseaward.[2]\r\n\r\nIf a stratified arrangement, and the rounded form of pebbles, are alone\r\nsufficient to lead us to the conclusion that certain rocks originated\r\nunder water, this opinion is farther confirmed by the distinct and\r\nindependent evidence of _fossils,_ so abundantly included in the\r\nearth’s crust. By a _fossil_ is meant any body, or the traces of the\r\nexistence of any body, whether animal or vegetable, which has been\r\nburied in the earth by natural causes. Now the remains of animals,\r\nespecially of aquatic species, are found almost everywhere imbedded in\r\nstratified rocks, and sometimes, in the case of limestone, they are in\r\nsuch abundance as to constitute the entire mass of the rock itself.\r\nShells and corals are the most frequent, and with them are often\r\nassociated the bones and teeth of fishes, fragments of wood,\r\nimpressions of leaves, and other organic substances. Fossil shells, of\r\nforms such as now abound in the sea, are met with far inland, both near\r\nthe surface, and at great depths below it. They occur at all heights\r\nabove the level of the ocean, having been observed at elevations of\r\nmore than 8000 feet in the Pyrenees, 10,000 in the Alps, 13,000 in the\r\nAndes, and above 18,000 feet in the Himalaya.[3]\r\n\r\nThese shells belong mostly to marine testacea, but in some places\r\nexclusively to forms characteristic of lakes and rivers. Hence it is\r\nconcluded that some ancient strata were deposited at the bottom of the\r\nsea, and others in lakes and estuaries.\r\n\r\nWe have now pointed out one great class of rocks, which, however they\r\nmay vary in mineral composition, colour, grain, or other characters,\r\nexternal and internal, may nevertheless be grouped together as having a\r\ncommon origin. They have all been formed under water, in the same\r\nmanner as modern accumulations of sand, mud, shingle, banks of shells,\r\nreefs of coral, and the like, and are all characterised by\r\nstratification or fossils, or by both.\r\n\r\nVolcanic Rocks.—The division of rocks which we may next consider are\r\nthe volcanic, or those which have been produced at or near the surface\r\nwhether in ancient or modern times, not by water, but by the action of\r\nfire or subterranean heat. These rocks are for the most part\r\nunstratified, and are devoid of fossils. They are more partially\r\ndistributed than aqueous formations, at least in respect to horizontal\r\nextension. Among those parts of Europe where they exhibit characters\r\nnot to be mistaken, I may mention not only Sicily and the country round\r\nNaples, but Auvergne, Velay, and Vivarais, now the departments of Puy\r\nde Dome, Haute Loire, and Ardêche, towards the centre and south of\r\nFrance, in which are several hundred conical hills having the forms of\r\nmodern volcanoes, with craters more or less perfect on many of their\r\nsummits. These cones are composed moreover of lava, sand, and ashes,\r\nsimilar to those of active volcanoes. Streams of lava may sometimes be\r\ntraced from the cones into the adjoining valleys, where they have\r\nchoked up the ancient channels of rivers with solid rock, in the same\r\nmanner as some modern flows of lava in Iceland have been known to do,\r\nthe rivers either flowing beneath or cutting out a narrow passage on\r\none side of the lava. Although none of these French volcanoes have been\r\nin activity within the period of history or tradition, their forms are\r\noften very perfect. Some, however, have been compared to the mere\r\nskeletons of volcanoes, the rains and torrents having washed their\r\nsides, and removed all the loose sand and scoriæ, leaving only the\r\nharder and more solid materials. By this erosion, and by earthquakes,\r\ntheir internal structure has occasionally been laid open to view, in\r\nfissures and ravines; and we then behold not only many successive beds\r\nand masses of porous lava, sand, and scoriæ, but also perpendicular\r\nwalls, or _dikes,_ as they are called, of volcanic rock, which have\r\nburst through the other materials. Such dikes are also observed in the\r\nstructure of Vesuvius, Etna, and other active volcanoes. They have been\r\nformed by the pouring of melted matter, whether from above or below,\r\ninto open fissures, and they commonly traverse deposits of _volcanic\r\ntuff,_ a substance produced by the showering down from the air, or\r\nincumbent waters, of sand and cinders, first shot up from the interior\r\nof the earth by the explosions of volcanic gases.\r\n\r\nBesides the parts of France above alluded to, there are other\r\ncountries, as the north of Spain, the south of Sicily, the Tuscan\r\nterritory of Italy, the lower Rhenish provinces, and Hungary, where\r\nspent volcanoes may be seen, still preserving in many cases a conical\r\nform, and having craters and often lava-streams connected with them.\r\n\r\nThere are also other rocks in England, Scotland, Ireland, and almost\r\nevery country in Europe, which we infer to be of igneous origin,\r\nalthough they do not form hills with cones and craters. Thus, for\r\nexample, we feel assured that the rock of Staffa, and that of the\r\nGiant’s Causeway, called basalt, is volcanic, because it agrees in its\r\ncolumnar structure and mineral composition with streams of lava which\r\nwe know to have flowed from the craters of volcanoes. We find also\r\nsimilar basaltic and other igneous rocks associated with beds of _tuff_\r\nin various parts of the British Isles, and forming _dikes,_ such as\r\nhave been spoken of; and some of the strata through which these dikes\r\ncut are occasionally altered at the point of contact, as if they had\r\nbeen exposed to the intense heat of melted matter.\r\n\r\nThe absence of cones and craters, and long narrow streams of\r\nsuperficial lava, in England and many other countries, is principally\r\nto be attributed to the eruptions having been submarine, just as a\r\nconsiderable proportion of volcanoes in our own times burst out beneath\r\nthe sea. But this question must be enlarged upon more fully in the\r\nchapters on Igneous Rocks, in which it will also be shown, that as\r\ndifferent sedimentary formations, containing each their characteristic\r\nfossils, have been deposited at successive periods, so also volcanic\r\nsand and scoriæ have been thrown out, and lavas have flowed over the\r\nland or bed of the sea, at many different epochs, or have been injected\r\ninto fissures; so that the igneous as well as the aqueous rocks may be\r\nclassed as a chronological series of monuments, throwing light on a\r\nsuccession of events in the history of the earth.\r\n\r\nPlutonic Rocks (_Granite,_ etc).—We have now pointed out the existence\r\nof two distinct orders of mineral masses, the aqueous and the volcanic:\r\nbut if we examine a large portion of a continent, especially if it\r\ncontain within it a lofty mountain range, we rarely fail to discover\r\ntwo other classes of rocks, very distinct from either of those above\r\nalluded to, and which we can neither assimilate to deposits such as are\r\nnow accumulated in lakes or seas, nor to those generated by ordinary\r\nvolcanic action. The members of both these divisions of rocks agree in\r\nbeing highly crystalline and destitute of organic remains. The rocks of\r\none division have been called Plutonic, comprehending all the granites\r\nand certain porphyries, which are nearly allied in some of their\r\ncharacters to volcanic formations. The members of the other class are\r\nstratified and often slaty, and have been called by some the\r\n_crystalline schists,_ in which group are included gneiss,\r\nmicaceous-schist (or mica-slate), hornblende-schist, statuary marble,\r\nthe finer kinds of roofing slate, and other rocks afterwards to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nAs it is admitted that nothing strictly analogous to these crystalline\r\nproductions can now be seen in the progress of formation on the earth’s\r\nsurface, it will naturally be asked, on what data we can find a place\r\nfor them in a system of classification founded on the origin of rocks.\r\nI cannot, in reply to this question, pretend to give the student, in a\r\nfew words, an intelligible account of the long chain of facts and\r\nreasonings from which geologists have been led to infer the nature of\r\nthe rocks in question. The result, however, may be briefly stated. All\r\nthe various kinds of granites which constitute the Plutonic family are\r\nsupposed to be of igneous or aqueo-igneous origin, and to have been\r\nformed under great pressure, at a considerable depth in the earth, or\r\nsometimes, perhaps, under a certain weight of incumbent ocean. Like the\r\nlava of volcanoes, they have been melted, and afterwards cooled and\r\ncrystallised, but with extreme slowness, and under conditions very\r\ndifferent from those of bodies cooling in the open air. Hence they\r\ndiffer from the volcanic rocks, not only by their more crystalline\r\ntexture, but also by the absence of tuffs and breccias, which are the\r\nproducts of eruptions at the earth’s surface, or beneath seas of\r\ninconsiderable depth. They differ also by the absence of pores or\r\ncellular cavities, to which the expansion of the entangled gases gives\r\nrise in ordinary lava.\r\n\r\nMetamorphic, or Stratified Crystalline Rocks.—The fourth and last great\r\ndivision of rocks are the crystalline strata and slates, or schists,\r\ncalled gneiss, mica-schist, clay-slate, chlorite-schist, marble, and\r\nthe like, the origin of which is more doubtful than that of the other\r\nthree classes. They contain no pebbles, or sand, or scoriæ, or angular\r\npieces of imbedded stone, and no traces of organic bodies, and they are\r\noften as crystalline as granite, yet are divided into beds,\r\ncorresponding in form and arrangement to those of sedimentary\r\nformations, and are therefore said to be stratified. The beds sometimes\r\nconsist of an alternation of substances varying in colour, composition,\r\nand thickness, precisely as we see in stratified fossiliferous\r\ndeposits. According to the Huttonian theory, which I adopt as the most\r\nprobable, and which will be afterwards more fully explained, the\r\nmaterials of these strata were originally deposited from water in the\r\nusual form of sediment, but they were subsequently so altered by\r\nsubterranean heat, as to assume a new texture. It is demonstrable, in\r\nsome cases at least, that such a complete conversion has actually taken\r\nplace, fossiliferous strata having exchanged an earthy for a highly\r\ncrystalline texture for a distance of a quarter of a mile from their\r\ncontact with granite. In some cases, dark limestones, replete with\r\nshells and corals, have been turned into white statuary marble; and\r\nhard clays, containing vegetable or other remains, into slates called\r\nmica-schist or hornblende-schist, every vestige of the organic bodies\r\nhaving been obliterated.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are in a great degree ignorant of the precise nature of the\r\ninfluence exerted in these cases, yet it evidently bears some analogy\r\nto that which volcanic heat and gases are known to produce; and the\r\naction may be conveniently called Plutonic, because it appears to have\r\nbeen developed in those regions where Plutonic rocks are generated, and\r\nunder similar circumstances of pressure and depth in the earth.\r\nIntensely heated water or steam permeating stratified masses under\r\ngreat pressure have no doubt played their part in producing the\r\ncrystalline texture and other changes, and it is clear that the\r\ntransforming influence has often pervaded entire mountain masses of\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the hypothesis above alluded to, I proposed in the\r\nfirst edition of the Principles of Geology (1833) the term\r\n“Metamorphic” for the altered strata, a term derived from meta, _\r\ntrans,_ and morphe, _forma._\r\n\r\nHence there are four great classes of rocks considered in reference to\r\ntheir origin—the aqueous, the volcanic, the Plutonic, and the\r\nmetamorphic. In the course of this work it will be shown that portions\r\nof each of these four distinct classes have originated at many\r\nsuccessive periods. They have all been produced contemporaneously, and\r\nmay even now be in the progress of formation on a large scale. It is\r\nnot true, as was formerly supposed, that all granites, together with\r\nthe crystalline or metamorphic strata, were first formed, and therefore\r\nentitled to be called “primitive,” and that the aqueous and volcanic\r\nrocks were afterwards superimposed, and should, therefore, rank as\r\nsecondary in the order of time. This idea was adopted in the infancy of\r\nthe science, when all formations, whether stratified or unstratified,\r\nearthy or crystalline, with or without fossils, were alike regarded as\r\nof aqueous origin. At that period it was naturally argued that the\r\nfoundation must be older than the superstructure; but it was afterwards\r\ndiscovered that this opinion was by no means in every instance a\r\nlegitimate deduction from facts; for the inferior parts of the earth’s\r\ncrust have often been modified, and even entirely changed, by the\r\ninfluence of volcanic and other subterranean causes, while superimposed\r\nformations have not been in the slightest degree altered. In other\r\nwords, the destroying and renovating processes have given birth to new\r\nrocks below, while those above, whether crystalline or fossiliferous,\r\nhave remained in their ancient condition. Even in cities, such as\r\nVenice and Amsterdam, it cannot be laid down as universally true that\r\nthe upper parts of each edifice, whether of brick or marble, are more\r\nmodern than the foundations on which they rest, for these often consist\r\nof wooden piles, which may have rotted and been replaced one after the\r\nother, without the least injury to the buildings above; meanwhile,\r\nthese may have required scarcely any repair, and may have been\r\nconstantly inhabited. So it is with the habitable surface of our globe,\r\nin its relation to large masses of rock immediately below; it may\r\ncontinue the same for ages, while subjacent materials, at a great\r\ndepth, are passing from a solid to a fluid state, and then\r\nreconsolidating, so as to acquire a new texture.\r\n\r\nAs all the crystalline rocks may, in some respects, be viewed as\r\nbelonging to one great family, whether they be stratified or\r\nunstratified, metamorphic or Plutonic, it will often be convenient to\r\nspeak of them by one common name. It being now ascertained, as above\r\nstated, that they are of very different ages, sometimes newer than the\r\nstrata called secondary, the terms primitive and primary which were\r\nformerly used for the whole must be abandoned, as they would imply a\r\nmanifest contradiction. It is indispensable, therefore, to find a new\r\nname, one which must not be of chronological import, and must express,\r\non the one hand, some peculiarity equally attributable to granite and\r\ngneiss (to the Plutonic as well as the _altered_ rocks), and, on the\r\nother, must have reference to characters in which those rocks differ,\r\nboth from the volcanic and from the _unaltered_ sedimentary strata. I\r\nproposed in the Principles of Geology (first edition, vol. iii) the\r\nterm “hypogene” for this purpose, derived from upo, _ under,_ and\r\nginomai, _to be,_ or _to be born_; a word implying the theory that\r\ngranite, gneiss, and the other crystalline formations are alike\r\n_netherformed_ rocks, or rocks which have not assumed their present\r\nform and structure at the surface. They occupy the lowest place in the\r\norder of superposition. Even in regions such as the Alps, where some\r\nmasses of granite and gneiss can be shown to be of comparatively modern\r\ndate, belonging, for example, to the period hereafter to be described\r\nas tertiary, they are still _underlying_ rocks. They never repose on\r\nthe volcanic or trappean formations, nor on strata containing organic\r\nremains. They are _hypogene,_ as “being under” all the rest.\r\n\r\nFrom what has now been said, the reader will understand that each of\r\nthe four great classes of rocks may be studied under two distinct\r\npoints of view; first, they may be studied simply as mineral masses\r\nderiving their origin from particular causes, and having a certain\r\ncomposition, form, and position in the earth’s crust, or other\r\ncharacters both positive and negative, such as the presence or absence\r\nof organic remains. In the second place, the rocks of each class may be\r\nviewed as a grand chronological series of monuments, attesting a\r\nsuccession of events in the former history of the globe and its living\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nI shall accordingly proceed to treat of each family of rocks; first, in\r\nreference to those characters which are not chronological, and then in\r\nparticular relation to the several periods when they were formed.\r\n\r\n [1] See Principles of Geology, by the Author, Index, “Nile,” “Rivers,”\r\n etc.\r\n\r\n [2] See p. 44, Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n [3] Col. R. J. Strachey found oolitic fossils 18,400 feet high in the\r\n Himalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nAQUEOUS ROCKS.—THEIR COMPOSITION AND FORMS OF STRATIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineral Composition of Strata. — Siliceous Rocks. — Argillaceous. —\r\nCalcareous. — Gypsum. — Forms of Stratification. — Original\r\nHorizontality. — Thinning out. — Diagonal Arrangement. — Ripple-mark.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the arrangement explained in the last chapter, we shall\r\nbegin by examining the aqueous or sedimentary rocks, which are for the\r\nmost part distinctly stratified, and contain fossils. We may first\r\nstudy them with reference to their mineral composition, external\r\nappearance, position, mode of origin, organic contents, and other\r\ncharacters which belong to them as aqueous formations, independently of\r\ntheir age, and we may afterwards consider them chronologically or with\r\nreference to the successive geological periods when they originated.\r\n\r\nI have already given an outline of the data which led to the belief\r\nthat the stratified and fossiliferous rocks were originally deposited\r\nunder water; but, before entering into a more detailed investigation,\r\nit will be desirable to say something of the ordinary materials of\r\nwhich such strata are composed. These may be said to belong principally\r\nto three divisions, the siliceous, the argillaceous, and the\r\ncalcareous, which are formed respectively of flint, clay, and carbonate\r\nof lime. Of these, the siliceous are chiefly made up of sand or flinty\r\ngrains; the argillaceous, or clayey, of a mixture of siliceous matter\r\nwith a certain proportion, about a fourth in weight, of aluminous\r\nearth; and, lastly, the calcareous rocks, or limestones, of carbonic\r\nacid and lime.\r\n\r\nSiliceous and Arenaceous Rocks.—To speak first of the sandy division:\r\nbeds of loose sand are frequently met with, of which the grains consist\r\nentirely of silex, which term comprehends all purely siliceous\r\nminerals, as quartz and common flint. Quartz is silex in its purest\r\nform. Flint usually contains some admixture of alumina and oxide of\r\niron. The siliceous grains in sand are usually rounded, as if by the\r\naction of running water. Sandstone is an aggregate of such grains,\r\nwhich often cohere together without any visible cement, but more\r\ncommonly are bound together by a slight quantity of siliceous or\r\ncalcareous matter, or by oxide of iron or clay.\r\n\r\nPure siliceous rocks may be known by not effervescing when a drop of\r\nnitric, sulphuric or other acid is applied to them, or by the grains\r\nnot being readily scratched or broken by ordinary pressure. In nature\r\nthere is every intermediate gradation, from perfectly loose sand to the\r\nhardest sandstone. In _micaceous sandstones_ mica is very abundant; and\r\nthe thin silvery plates into which that mineral divides are often\r\narranged in layers parallel to the planes of stratification, giving a\r\nslaty or laminated texture to the rock.\r\n\r\nWhen sandstone is coarse-grained, it is usually called _ grit._ If the\r\ngrains are rounded, and large enough to be called pebbles, it becomes a\r\n_conglomerate_ or _pudding-stone,_ which may consist of pieces of one\r\nor of many different kinds of rock. A conglomerate, therefore, is\r\nsimply gravel bound together by cement.\r\n\r\nArgillaceous Rocks.—Clay, strictly speaking, is a mixture of silex or\r\nflint with a large proportion, usually about one fourth, of alumina, or\r\nargil; but in common language, any earth which possesses sufficient\r\nductility, when kneaded up with water, to be fashioned like paste by\r\nthe hand, or by the potter’s lathe, is called a _clay_; and such clays\r\nvary greatly in their composition, and are, in general, nothing more\r\nthan mud derived from the decomposition or wearing down of rocks. The\r\npurest clay found in nature is porcelain clay, or kaolin, which results\r\nfrom the decomposition of a rock composed of feldspar and quartz, and\r\nit is almost always mixed with quartz. The kaolin of China consists of\r\n71·15 parts of silex, 15·86 of alumine, 1·92 of lime, and 6·73 of\r\nwater;[1] but other porcelain clays differ materially, that of Cornwall\r\nbeing composed, according to Boase, of nearly equal parts of silica and\r\nalumine, with 1 per cent of magnesia.[2] _ Shale_ has also the\r\nproperty, like clay, of becoming plastic in water: it is a more solid\r\nform of clay, or argillaceous matter, condensed by pressure. It always\r\ndivides into laminæ more or less regular.\r\n\r\nOne general character of all argillaceous rocks is to give out a\r\npeculiar, earthy odour when breathed upon, which is a test of the\r\npresence of alumine, although it does not belong to pure alumine, but,\r\napparently, to the combination of that substance with oxide of iron.[3]\r\n\r\nCalcareous Rocks.—This division comprehends those rocks which, like\r\nchalk, are composed chiefly of lime and carbonic acid. Shells and\r\ncorals are also formed of the same elements, with the addition of\r\nanimal matter. To obtain pure lime it is necessary to calcine these\r\ncalcareous substances, that is to say, to expose them to heat of\r\nsufficient intensity to drive off the carbonic acid, and other volatile\r\nmatter. White chalk is sometimes pure carbonate of lime; and this rock,\r\nalthough usually in a soft and earthy state, is occasionally\r\nsufficiently solid to be used for building, and even passes into a\r\n_compact_ stone, or a stone of which the separate parts are so minute\r\nas not to be distinguishable from each other by the naked eye.\r\n\r\nMany limestones are made up entirely of minute fragments of shells and\r\ncoral, or of calcareous sand cemented together. These last might be\r\ncalled “calcareous sandstones;” but that term is more properly applied\r\nto a rock in which the grains are partly calcareous and partly\r\nsiliceous, or to quartzose sandstones, having a cement of carbonate of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nThe variety of limestone called _oolite_ is composed of numerous small\r\negg-like grains, resembling the roe of a fish, each of which has\r\nusually a small fragment of sand as a nucleus, around which concentric\r\nlayers of calcareous matter have accumulated.\r\n\r\nAny limestone which is sufficiently hard to take a fine polish is\r\ncalled _marble._ Many of these are fossiliferous; but statuary marble,\r\nwhich is also called saccharoid limestone, as having a texture\r\nresembling that of loaf-sugar, is devoid of fossils, and is in many\r\ncases a member of the metamorphic series.\r\n\r\n_Siliceous limestone_ is an intimate mixture of carbonate of lime and\r\nflint, and is harder in proportion as the flinty matter predominates.\r\n\r\nThe presence of carbonate of lime in a rock may be ascertained by\r\napplying to the surface a small drop of diluted sulphuric, nitric, or\r\nmuriatic acid, or strong vinegar; for the lime, having a greater\r\nchemical affinity for any one of these acids than for the carbonic,\r\nunites immediately with them to form new compounds, thereby becoming a\r\nsulphate, nitrate or muriate of lime. The carbonic acid, when thus\r\nliberated from its union with the lime, escapes in a gaseous form, and\r\nfroths up or effervesces as it makes its way in small bubbles through\r\nthe drop of liquid. This effervescence is brisk or feeble in proportion\r\nas the limestone is pure or impure, or, in other words, according to\r\nthe quantity of foreign matter mixed with the carbonate of lime.\r\nWithout the aid of this test, the most experienced eye cannot always\r\ndetect the presence of carbonate of lime in rocks.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned three classes of rocks, the siliceous,\r\nargillaceous, and calcareous, pass continually into each other, and\r\nrarely occur in a perfectly separate and pure form. Thus it is an\r\nexception to the general rule to meet with a limestone as pure as\r\nordinary white chalk, or with clay as aluminous as that used in\r\nCornwall for porcelain, or with sand so entirely composed of siliceous\r\ngrains as the white sand of Alum Bay, in the Isle of Wight, employed in\r\nthe manufacture of glass, or sandstone so pure as the grit of\r\nFontainebleau, used for pavement in France. More commonly we find sand\r\nand clay, or clay and marl, intermixed in the same mass. When the sand\r\nand clay are each in considerable quantity, the mixture is called\r\n_loam._ If there is much calcareous matter in clay it is called _marl_;\r\nbut this term has unfortunately been used so vaguely, as often to be\r\nvery ambiguous. It has been applied to substances in which there is no\r\nlime; as, to that red loam usually called red marl in certain parts of\r\nEngland. Agriculturists were in the habit of calling any soil a marl\r\nwhich, like true marl, fell to pieces readily on exposure to the air.\r\nHence arose the confusion of using this name for soils which,\r\nconsisting of loam, were easily worked by the plough, though devoid of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n_Marl slate_ bears the same relation to marl which shale bears to clay,\r\nbeing a calcareous shale. It is very abundant in some countries, as in\r\nthe Swiss Alps. Argillaceous or marly limestone is also of common\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThere are few other kinds of rock which enter so largely into the\r\ncomposition of sedimentary strata as to make it necessary to dwell here\r\non their characters. I may, however, mention two others—magnesian\r\nlimestone or dolomite, and gypsum. _Magnesian limestone_ is composed of\r\ncarbonate of lime and carbonate of magnesia; the proportion of the\r\nlatter amounting in some cases to nearly one half. It effervesces much\r\nmore slowly and feebly with acids than common limestone. In England\r\nthis rock is generally of a yellowish colour; but it varies greatly in\r\nmineralogical character, passing from an earthy state to a white\r\ncompact stone of great hardness. _Dolomite,_ so common in many parts of\r\nGermany and France, is also a variety of magnesian limestone, usually\r\nof a granular texture.\r\n\r\n_Gypsum_ is a rock composed of sulphuric acid, lime, and water. It is\r\nusually a soft whitish-yellow rock, with a texture resembling that of\r\nloaf-sugar, but sometimes it is entirely composed of lenticular\r\ncrystals. It is insoluble in acids, and does not effervesce like chalk\r\nand dolomite, because it does not contain carbonic acid gas, or fixed\r\nair, the lime being already combined with sulphuric acid, for which it\r\nhas a stronger affinity than for any other. Anhydrous gypsum is a rare\r\nvariety, into which water does not enter as a component part. _\r\nGypseous marl_ is a mixture of gypsum and marl. _Alabaster_ is a\r\ngranular and compact variety of gypsum found in masses large enough to\r\nbe used in sculpture and architecture. It is sometimes a pure\r\nsnow-white substance, as that of Volterra in Tuscany, well known as\r\nbeing carved for works of art in Florence and Leghorn. It is a softer\r\nstone than marble, and more easily wrought.\r\n\r\nForms of Stratification.—A series of strata sometimes consists of one\r\nof the above rocks, sometimes of two or more in alternating beds.\r\n\r\nThus, in the coal districts of England, for example, we often pass\r\nthrough several beds of sandstone, some of finer, others of coarser\r\ngrain, some white, others of a dark colour, and below these, layers of\r\nshale and sandstone or beds of shale, divisible into leaf-like laminæ,\r\nand containing beautiful impressions of plants. Then again we meet with\r\nbeds of pure and impure coal, alternating with shales and sandstones,\r\nand underneath the whole, perhaps, are calcareous strata, or beds of\r\nlimestone, filled with corals and marine shells, each bed\r\ndistinguishable from another by certain fossils, or by the abundance of\r\nparticular species of shells or zoophytes.\r\n\r\nThis alternation of different kinds of rock produces the most distinct\r\nstratification; and we often find beds of limestone and marl,\r\nconglomerate and sandstone, sand and clay, recurring again and again,\r\nin nearly regular order, throughout a series of many hundred strata.\r\nThe causes which may produce these phenomena are various, and have been\r\nfully discussed in my treatise on the modern changes of the earth’s\r\nsurface.[4] It is there seen that rivers flowing into lakes and seas\r\nare charged with sediment, varying in quantity, composition, colour,\r\nand grain according to the seasons; the waters are sometimes flooded\r\nand rapid, at other periods low and feeble; different tributaries,\r\nalso, draining peculiar countries and soils, and therefore charged with\r\npeculiar sediment, are swollen at distinct periods. It was also shown\r\nthat the waves of the sea and currents undermine the cliffs during\r\nwintry storms, and sweep away the materials into the deep, after which\r\na season of tranquillity succeeds, when nothing but the finest mud is\r\nspread by the movements of the ocean over the same submarine area.\r\n\r\nIt is not the object of the present work to give a description of these\r\noperations, repeated as they are, year after year, and century after\r\ncentury; but I may suggest an explanation of the manner in which some\r\nmicaceous sandstones have originated, namely, those in which we see\r\ninnumerable thin layers of mica dividing layers of fine quartzose sand.\r\nI observed the same arrangement of materials in recent mud deposited in\r\nthe estuary of Laroche St. Bernard in Brittany, at the mouth of the\r\nLoire. The surrounding rocks are of gneiss, which, by its waste,\r\nsupplies the mud: when this dries at low water, it is found to consist\r\nof brown laminated clay, divided by thin seams of mica. The separation\r\nof the mica in this case, or in that of micaceous sandstones, may be\r\nthus understood. If we take a handful of quartzose sand, mixed with\r\nmica, and throw it into a clear running stream, we see the materials\r\nimmediately sorted by the water, the grains of quartz falling almost\r\ndirectly to the bottom, while the plates of mica take a much longer\r\ntime to reach the bottom, and are carried farther down the stream. At\r\nthe first instant the water is turbid, but immediately after the flat\r\nsurfaces of the plates of mica are seen all alone, reflecting a silvery\r\nlight, as they descend slowly, to form a distinct micaceous lamina. The\r\nmica is the heavier mineral of the two; but it remains a longer time\r\nsuspended in the fluid, owing to its greater extent of surface. It is\r\neasy, therefore, to perceive that where such mud is acted upon by a\r\nriver or tidal current, the thin plates of mica will be carried\r\nfarther, and not deposited in the same places as the grains of quartz;\r\nand since the force and velocity of the stream varies from time to\r\ntime, layers of mica or of sand will be thrown down successively on the\r\nsame area.\r\n\r\nOriginal Horizontality.—It is said generally that the upper and under\r\nsurfaces of strata, or the “planes of stratification,” are parallel.\r\nAlthough this is not strictly true, they make an approach to\r\nparallelism, for the same reason that sediment is usually deposited at\r\nfirst in nearly horizontal layers. Such an arrangement can by no means\r\nbe attributed to an original evenness or horizontality in the bed of\r\nthe sea: for it is ascertained that in those places where no matter has\r\nbeen recently deposited, the bottom of the ocean is often as uneven as\r\nthat of the dry land, having in like manner its hills, valleys, and\r\nravines. Yet if the sea should go down, or be removed from near the\r\nmouth of a large river where a delta has been forming, we should see\r\nextensive plains of mud and sand laid dry, which, to the eye, would\r\nappear perfectly level, although, in reality, they would slope gently\r\nfrom the land towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThis tendency in newly-formed strata to assume a horizontal position\r\narises principally from the motion of the water, which forces along\r\nparticles of sand or mud at the bottom, and causes them to settle in\r\nhollows or depressions where they are less exposed to the force of a\r\ncurrent than when they are resting on elevated points. The velocity of\r\nthe current and the motion of the superficial waves diminish from the\r\nsurface downward, and are least in those depressions where the water is\r\ndeepest.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good illustration of the principle here alluded to may be sometimes\r\nseen in the neighbourhood of a volcano, when a section, whether natural\r\nor artificial, has laid open to view a succession of various-coloured\r\nlayers of sand and ashes, which have fallen in showers upon uneven\r\nground. Thus let A B (Fig. 1) be two ridges, with an intervening\r\nvalley. These original inequalities of the surface have been gradually\r\neffaced by beds of sand and ashes _c, d, e,_ the surface at _e_ being\r\nquite level. It will be seen that, although the materials of the first\r\nlayers have accommodated themselves in a great degree to the shape of\r\nthe ground A B, yet each bed is thickest at the bottom. At first a\r\ngreat many particles would be carried by their own gravity down the\r\nsteep sides of A and B, and others would afterwards be blown by the\r\nwind as they fell off the ridges, and would settle in the hollow, which\r\nwould thus become more and more effaced as the strata accumulated from\r\n_c_ to _e._ Now, water in motion can exert this levelling power on\r\nsimilar materials more easily than air, for almost all stones lose in\r\nwater more than a third of the weight which they have in air, the\r\nspecific gravity of rocks being in general as 2½ when compared to that\r\nof water, which is estimated at 1. But the buoyancy of sand or mud\r\nwould be still greater in the sea, as the density of salt-water exceeds\r\nthat of fresh.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. Section of strata of sandtone, grit, and congolmerate.\r\n\r\nYet, however uniform and horizontal may be the surface of new deposits\r\nin general, there are still many disturbing causes, such as eddies in\r\nthe water, and currents moving first in one and then in another\r\ndirection, which frequently cause irregularities. We may sometimes\r\nfollow a bed of limestone, shale, or sandstone, for a distance of many\r\nhundred yards continuously; but we generally find at length that each\r\nindividual stratum thins out, and allows the beds which were previously\r\nabove and below it to meet. If the materials are coarse, as in grits\r\nand conglomerates, the same beds can rarely be traced many yards\r\nwithout varying in size, and often coming to an end abruptly. (See Fig.\r\n2.)\r\n\r\nFig. 3: Section of sand at Sandy Hill, near Biggleswade, Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\nDiagonal or Cross Stratification.—There is also another phenomenon of\r\nfrequent occurrence. We find a series of larger strata, each of which\r\nis composed of a number of minor layers placed obliquely to the general\r\nplanes of stratification. To this diagonal arrangement the name of\r\n“false or cross bedding” has been given. Thus in the section (Fig. 3)\r\nwe see seven or eight large beds of loose sand, yellow and brown, and\r\nthe lines _a, b, c_ mark some of the principal planes of\r\nstratification, which are nearly horizontal. But the greater part of\r\nthe subordinate laminæ do not conform to these planes, but have often a\r\nsteep slope, the inclination being sometimes towards opposite points of\r\nthe compass. When the sand is loose and incoherent, as in the case here\r\nrepresented, the deviation from parallelism of the slanting laminæ\r\ncannot possibly be accounted for by any rearrangement of the particles\r\nacquired during the consolidation of the rock. In what manner, then,\r\ncan such irregularities be due to original deposition? We must suppose\r\nthat at the bottom of the sea, as well as in the beds of rivers, the\r\nmotions of waves, currents, and eddies often cause mud, sand, and\r\ngravel to be thrown down in heaps on particular spots, instead of being\r\nspread out uniformly over a wide area. Sometimes, when banks are thus\r\nformed, currents may cut passages through them, just as a river forms\r\nits bed.\r\n\r\nFig. 4Fig. 5\r\n\r\nSuppose the bank A (Fig. 4) to be thus formed with a steep sloping\r\nside, and, the water being in a tranquil state, the layer of sediment\r\nNo. 1 is thrown down upon it, conforming nearly to its surface.\r\nAfterwards the other layers, 2, 3, 4, may be deposited in succession,\r\nso that the bank B C D is formed. If the current then increases in\r\nvelocity, it may cut away the upper portion of this mass down to the\r\ndotted line e, and deposit the materials thus removed farther on, so as\r\nto form the layers 5, 6, 7, 8. We have now the bank B, C, D, E (Fig.\r\n5), of which the surface is almost level, and on which the nearly\r\nhorizontal layers, 9, 10, 11, may then accumulate. It was shown in Fig.\r\n3 that the diagonal layers of successive strata may sometimes have an\r\nopposite slope. This is well seen in some cliffs of loose sand on the\r\nSuffolk coast. A portion of one of these is represented in Fig. 6,\r\nwhere the layers, of which there are about six in the thickness of an\r\ninch, are composed of quartzose grains. This arrangement may have been\r\ndue to the altered direction of the tides and currents in the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nFig. 6: Cliff between Mismer and Dunwich.\r\n\r\nFig. 7: Section from Monte Calvo to the sea by the valley of the\r\nMagnan, near Nice.\r\n\r\nThe description above given of the slanting position of the minor\r\nlayers constituting a single stratum is in certain cases applicable on\r\na much grander scale to masses several hundred feet thick, and many\r\nmiles in extent. A fine example may be seen at the base of the Maritime\r\nAlps near Nice. The mountains here terminate abruptly in the sea, so\r\nthat a depth of one hundred fathoms is often found within a stone’s\r\nthrow of the beach, and sometimes a depth of 3000 feet within half a\r\nmile. But at certain points, strata of sand, marl, or conglomerate\r\nintervene between the shore and the mountains, as in the section (Fig.\r\n7), where a vast succession of slanting beds of gravel and sand may be\r\ntraced from the sea to Monte Calvo, a distance of no less than nine\r\nmiles in a straight line. The dip of these beds is remarkably uniform,\r\nbeing always southward or towards the Mediterranean, at an angle of\r\nabout 25°. They are exposed to view in nearly vertical precipices,\r\nvarying from 200 to 600 feet in height, which bound the valley through\r\nwhich the river Magnan flows. Although, in a general view, the strata\r\nappear to be parallel and uniform, they are nevertheless found, when\r\nexamined closely, to be wedge-shaped, and to thin out when followed for\r\na few hundred feet or yards, so that we may suppose them to have been\r\nthrown down originally upon the side of a steep bank where a river or\r\nAlpine torrent discharged itself into a deep and tranquil sea, and\r\nformed a delta, which advanced gradually from the base of Monte Calvo\r\nto a distance of nine miles from the original shore. If subsequently\r\nthis part of the Alps and bed of the sea were raised 700 feet, the\r\ndelta may have emerged, a deep channel may then have been cut through\r\nit by the river, and the coast may at the same time have acquired its\r\npresent configuration.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the torrents and streams which now descend from\r\nthe Alpine declivities to the shore, bring down annually, when the snow\r\nmelts, vast quantities of shingle and sand, and then, as they subside,\r\nfine mud, while in summer they are nearly or entirely dry; so that it\r\nmay be safely assumed that deposits like those of the valley of the\r\nMagnan, consisting of coarse gravel alternating with fine sediment, are\r\nstill in progress at many points, as, for instance, at the mouth of the\r\nVar. They must advance upon the Mediterranean in the form of great\r\nshoals terminating in a steep talus; such being the original mode of\r\naccumulation of all coarse materials conveyed into deep water,\r\nespecially where they are composed in great part of pebbles, which\r\ncannot be transported to indefinite distances by currents of moderate\r\nvelocity. By inattention to facts and inferences of this kind, a very\r\nexaggerated estimate has sometimes been made of the supposed depth of\r\nthe ancient ocean. There can be no doubt, for example, that the strata\r\n_a_, Fig. 7, or those nearest to Monte Calvo, are older than those\r\nindicated by _b_, and these again were formed before _c_; but the\r\nvertical depth of gravel and sand in any one place cannot be proved to\r\namount even to 1000 feet, although it may perhaps be much greater, yet\r\nprobably never exceeding at any point 3000 or 4000 feet. But were we to\r\nassume that all the strata were once horizontal, and that their present\r\ndip or inclination was due to subsequent movements, we should then be\r\nforced to conclude that a sea several miles deep had been filled up\r\nwith alternate layers of mud and pebbles thrown down one upon another.\r\n\r\nIn the locality now under consideration, situated a few miles to the\r\nwest of Nice, there are many geological data, the details of which\r\ncannot be given in this place, all leading to the opinion that, when\r\nthe deposit of the Magnan was formed, the shape and outline of the\r\nAlpine declivities and the shore greatly resembled what we now behold\r\nat many points in the neighbourhood. That the beds _a, b, c, d_ are of\r\ncomparatively modern date is proved by this fact, that in seams of\r\nloamy marl intervening between the pebbly beds are fossil shells, half\r\nof which belong to species now living in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nFig. 8: Slab of ripple-marked (New Red) sandstone from Cheshire.\r\n\r\nRipple-mark.—The ripple-mark, so common on the surface of sandstones of\r\nall ages (see Fig. 8), and which is so often seen on the sea-shore at\r\nlow tide, seems to originate in the drifting of materials along the\r\nbottom of the water, in a manner very similar to that which may explain\r\nthe inclined layers above described. This ripple is not entirely\r\nconfined to the beach between high and low water mark, but is also\r\nproduced on sands which are constantly covered by water. Similar\r\nundulating ridges and furrows may also be sometimes seen on the surface\r\nof drift snow and blown sand.\r\n\r\nThe ripple-mark is usually an indication of a sea-beach, or of water\r\nfrom six to ten feet deep, for the agitation caused by waves even\r\nduring storms extends to a very slight depth. To this rule, however,\r\nthere are some exceptions, and recent ripple-marks have been observed\r\nat the depth of 60 or 70 feet. It has also been ascertained that\r\ncurrents or large bodies of water in motion may disturb mud and sand at\r\nthe depth of 300 or even 450 feet.[5] Beach ripple, however, may\r\nusually be distinguished from current ripple by frequent changes in its\r\ndirection. In a slab of sandstone, not more than an inch thick, the\r\nfurrows or ridges of an ancient ripple may often be seen in several\r\nsuccessive laminæ to run towards different points of the compass.\r\n\r\n [1] W.

We should often be unable to\r\ndetect any signs of stratification or of successive deposition, if\r\nparticular kinds of fossils did not occur here and there at certain\r\ndepths in the mass. At one level, for example, univalve shells of some\r\none or more species predominate; at another, bivalve shells; and at a\r\nthird, corals; while in some formations we find layers of vegetable\r\nmatter, commonly derived from land plants, separating strata.\r\n\r\nIt may appear inconceivable to a beginner how mountains, several\r\nthousand feet thick, can have become full of fossils from top to\r\nbottom; but the difficulty is removed, when he reflects on the origin\r\nof stratification, as explained in the last chapter, and allows\r\nsufficient time for the accumulation of sediment. He must never lose\r\nsight of the fact that, during the process of deposition, each separate\r\nlayer was once the uppermost, and immediately in contact with the water\r\nin which aquatic animals lived. Each stratum, in fact, however far it\r\nmay now lie beneath the surface, was once in the state of shingle, or\r\nloose sand or soft mud at the bottom of the sea, in which shells and\r\nother bodies easily became enveloped.\r\n\r\nRate of Deposition indicated by Fossils.—By attending to the nature of\r\nthese remains, we are often enabled to determine whether the deposition\r\nwas slow or rapid, whether it took place in a deep or shallow sea, near\r\nthe shore or far from land, and whether the water was salt, brackish,\r\nor fresh. Some limestones consist almost exclusively of corals, and in\r\nmany cases it is evident that the present position of each fossil\r\nzoophyte has been determined by the manner in which it grew originally.\r\nThe axis of the coral, for example, if its natural growth is erect,\r\nstill remains at right angles to the plane of stratification. If the\r\nstratum be now horizontal, the round spherical heads of certain species\r\ncontinue uppermost, and their points of attachment are directed\r\ndownward. This arrangement is sometimes repeated throughout a great\r\nsuccession of strata. From what we know of the growth of similar\r\nzoophytes in modern reefs, we infer that the rate of increase was\r\nextremely slow, and some of the fossils must have flourished for ages\r\nlike forest-trees, before they attained so large a size. During these\r\nages, the water must have been clear and transparent, for such corals\r\ncannot live in turbid water.\r\n\r\nFossil Gryphæ, covered both on the outside and inside with fossil\r\nserpulæ.\r\nIn like manner, when we see thousands of full-grown shells dispersed\r\neverywhere throughout a long series of strata, we cannot doubt that\r\ntime was required for the multiplication of successive generations; and\r\nthe evidence of slow accumulation is rendered more striking from the\r\nproofs, so often discovered, of fossil bodies having lain for a time on\r\nthe floor of the ocean after death before they were imbedded in\r\nsediment. Nothing, for example, is more common than to see fossil\r\noysters in clay, with Serpulæ, or barnacles (acorn-shells), or corals,\r\nand other creatures, attached to the inside of the valves, so that the\r\nmollusk was certainly not buried in argillaceous mud the moment it\r\ndied. There must have been an interval during which it was still\r\nsurrounded with clear water, when the creatures whose remains now\r\nadhere to it grew from an embryonic to a mature state. Attached shells\r\nwhich are merely external, like some of the Serpulæ (_a_) in Fig. 9,\r\nmay often have grown upon an oyster or other shell while the animal\r\nwithin was still living; but if they are found on the inside, it could\r\nonly happen after the death of the inhabitant of the shell which\r\naffords the support. Thus, in Fig. 9, it will be seen that two Serpulæ\r\nhave grown on the interior, one of them exactly on the place where the\r\nadductor muscle of the _Gryphæa_ (a kind of oyster) was fixed.\r\n\r\nFig. 10: Serpula attached to a fossil. Fig. 11: Recent Spatangus with\r\nspines removed from one side.\r\nSome fossil shells, even if simply attached to the _ outside_ of\r\nothers, bear full testimony to the conclusion above alluded to, namely,\r\nthat an interval elapsed between the death of the creature to whose\r\nshell they adhere, and the burial of the same in mud or sand. The\r\nsea-urchins, or _Echini_, so abundant in white chalk, afford a good\r\nillustration. It is well known that these animals, when living, are\r\ninvariably covered with spines supported by rows of tubercles. These\r\nlast are only seen after the death of the sea-urchin, when the spines\r\nhave dropped off. In Fig. 11 a living species of _Spatangus_, common on\r\nour coast, is represented with one half of its shell stripped of the\r\nspines. In Fig. 10 a fossil of a similar and allied genus from the\r\nwhite chalk of England shows the naked surface which the individuals of\r\nthis family exhibit when denuded of their bristles. The full-grown _\r\nSerpula_, therefore, which now adheres externally, could not have begun\r\nto grow till the _Micraster_ had died, and the spines became detached.\r\n\r\nFig. 12: Ananchytes from the chalk.\r\nNow the series of events here attested by a single fossil may be\r\ncarried a step farther. Thus, for example, we often meet with a\r\nsea-urchin (_Ananchytes_) in the chalk (see Fig. 12) which has fixed to\r\nit the lower valve of a _Crania_, a genus of bivalve mollusca. The\r\nupper valve (_b_, Fig. 12) is almost invariably wanting, though\r\noccasionally found in a perfect state of preservation in white chalk at\r\nsome distance. In this case, we see clearly that the sea-urchin first\r\nlived from youth to age, then died and lost its spines, which were\r\ncarried away. Then the young _Crania_ adhered to the bared shell, grew\r\nand perished in its turn; after which the upper valve was separated\r\nfrom the lower before the _Ananchytes_ became enveloped in chalky mud.\r\n\r\nFig. 13: Fossil wood bored by Teredina.\r\n\r\nFig. 14: Recent wood bored by Teredo.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to mention one more illustration of the manner in which\r\nsingle fossils may sometimes throw light on a former state of things,\r\nboth in the bed of the ocean and on some adjoining land. We meet with\r\nmany fragments of wood bored by ship-worms at various depths in the\r\nclay on which London is built. Entire branches and stems of trees,\r\nseveral feet in length, are sometimes found drilled all over by the\r\nholes of these borers, the tubes and shells of the mollusk still\r\nremaining in the cylindrical hollows. In Fig. 14, _ e_, a\r\nrepresentation is given of a piece of recent wood pierced by the\r\n_Teredo navalis_, or common ship-worm, which destroys wooden piles and\r\nships. When the cylindrical tube _d_ has been extracted from the wood,\r\nthe valves are seen at the larger or anterior extremity, as shown at\r\n_c._ In like manner, a piece of fossil wood (_a_, Fig. 13) has been\r\nperforated by a kindred but extinct genus, the _Teredina_ of Lamarck.\r\nThe calcareous tube of this mollusk was united and, as it were,\r\nsoldered on to the valves of the shell (_b_), which therefore cannot be\r\ndetached from the tube, like the valves of the recent _Teredo._ The\r\nwood in this fossil specimen is now converted into a stony mass, a\r\nmixture of clay and lime; but it must once have been buoyant and\r\nfloating in the sea, when the _ Teredinæ_ lived upon, and perforated\r\nit. Again, before the infant colony settled upon the drift wood, part\r\nof a tree must have been floated down to the sea by a river, uprooted,\r\nperhaps, by a flood, or torn off and cast into the waves by the wind:\r\nand thus our thoughts are carried back to a prior period, when the tree\r\ngrew for years on dry land, enjoying a fit soil and climate.\r\n\r\nStrata of Organic Origin.—It has been already remarked that there are\r\nrocks in the interior of continents, at various depths in the earth,\r\nand at great heights above the sea, almost entirely made up of the\r\nremains of zoophytes and testacea. Such masses may be compared to\r\nmodern oyster-beds and coral-reefs; and, like them, the rate of\r\nincrease must have been extremely gradual. But there are a variety of\r\nstone deposits in the earth’s crust, now proved to have been derived\r\nfrom plants and animals of which the organic origin was not suspected\r\nuntil of late years, even by naturalists. Great surprise was therefore\r\ncreated some years since by the discovery of Professor Ehrenberg, of\r\nBerlin, that a certain kind of siliceous stone, called tripoli, was\r\nentirely composed of millions of the remains of organic beings, which\r\nwere formerly referred to microscopic Infusoria, but which are now\r\nadmitted to be plants. They abound in rivulets, lakes, and ponds in\r\nEngland and other countries, and are termed Diatomaceæ by those\r\nnaturalists who believe in their vegetable origin. The subject alluded\r\nto has long been well-known in the arts, under the name of infusorial\r\nearth or mountain meal, and is used in the form of powder for polishing\r\nstones and metals. It has been procured, among other places, from the\r\nmud of a lake at Dolgelly, in North Wales, and from Bilin, in Bohemia,\r\nin which latter place a single stratum, extending over a wide area, is\r\nno less than fourteen feet thick. This stone, when examined with a\r\npowerful microscope, is found to consist of the siliceous plates or\r\nfrustules of the above-figured Diatomaceæ, united together without any\r\nvisible cement. It is difficult to convey an idea of their extreme\r\nminuteness; but Ehrenberg estimates that in the Bilin tripoli there are\r\n41,000 millions of individuals of the _Gaillonella distans_ (see Fig.\r\n16) in every cubic inch (which weighs about 220 grains), or about 187\r\nmillions in a single grain. At every stroke, therefore, that we make\r\nwith this polishing powder, several millions, perhaps tens of millions,\r\nof perfect fossils are crushed to atoms.\r\n\r\nFigs 15 and 16: Gaillonella; Fig. 17: Bacillaria parodoxa\r\nA well-known substance, called bog-iron ore, often met with in\r\npeat-mosses, has often been shown by Ehrenberg to consist of\r\ninnumerable articulated threads, of a yellow ochre colour, composed of\r\nsilica, argillaceous matter, and peroxide of iron. These threads are\r\nthe cases of a minute microscopic body, called _Gaillonella ferruginea_\r\n(Fig. 15), associated with the siliceous frustules of other fresh-water\r\nalgæ. Layers of this iron ore occurring in Scotch peat bogs are often\r\ncalled “the pan,” and are sometimes of economical value.\r\n\r\nIt is clear much time must have been required for the accumulation of\r\nstrata to which countless generations of Diatomaceæ have contributed\r\ntheir remains; and these discoveries lead us naturally to suspect that\r\nother deposits, of which the materials have been supposed to be\r\ninorganic, may in reality be composed chiefly of microscopic organic\r\nbodies. That this is the case with the white chalk, has often been\r\nimagined, and is now proved to be the fact. It has, moreover, been\r\nlately discovered that the chambers into which these Foraminifera are\r\ndivided are actually often filled with thousands of well-preserved\r\norganic bodies, which abound in every minute grain of chalk, and are\r\nespecially apparent in the white coating of flints, often accompanied\r\nby innumerable needle-shaped spiculæ of sponges (see Chapter XVII).\r\n\r\n“The dust we tread upon was once alive!”—BYRON.\r\n\r\nHow faint an idea does this exclamation of the poet convey of the real\r\nwonders of nature! for here we discover proofs that the calcareous and\r\nsiliceous dust of which hills are composed has not only been once\r\nalive, but almost every particle, albeit invisible to the naked eye,\r\nstill retains the organic structure which, at periods of time\r\nincalculably remote, was impressed upon it by the powers of life.\r\n\r\nFresh-water and Marine Fossils.—Strata, whether deposited in salt or\r\nfresh water, have the same forms; but the imbedded fossils are very\r\ndifferent in the two cases, because the aquatic animals which frequent\r\nlakes and rivers are distinct from those inhabiting the sea. In the\r\nnorthern part of the Isle of Wight formations of marl and limestone,\r\nmore than 50 feet thick occur, in which the shells are of extinct\r\nspecies. Yet we recognise their fresh-water origin, because they are of\r\nthe same genera as those now abounding in ponds, lakes, and rivers,\r\neither in our own country or in warmer latitudes.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of France—in Auvergne, for example—strata occur of\r\nlimestone, marl, and sandstone hundreds of feet thick, which contain\r\nexclusively fresh-water and land shells, together with the remains of\r\nterrestrial quadrupeds. The number of land-shells scattered through\r\nsome of these fresh-water deposits is exceedingly great; and there are\r\ndistricts in Germany where the rocks scarcely contain any other fossils\r\nexcept snail-shells (_helices_); as, for instance, the limestone on the\r\nleft bank of the Rhine, between Mayence and Worms, at Oppenheim,\r\nFindheim, Budenheim, and other places. In order to account for this\r\nphenomenon, the geologist has only to examine the small deltas of\r\ntorrents which enter the Swiss lakes when the waters are low, such as\r\nthe newly-formed plain where the Kander enters the Lake of Thun. He\r\nthere sees sand and mud strewn over with innumerable dead land-shells,\r\nwhich have been brought down from the valleys in the Alps in the\r\npreceding spring, during the melting of the snows. Again, if we search\r\nthe sands on the borders of the Rhine, in the lower part of its course,\r\nwe find countless land-shells mixed with others of species belonging to\r\nlakes, stagnant pools, and marshes. These individuals have been washed\r\naway from the alluvial plains of the great river and its tributaries,\r\nsome from mountainous regions, others from the low country.\r\n\r\nAlthough fresh-water formations are often of great thickness, yet they\r\nare usually very limited in area when compared to marine deposits, just\r\nas lakes and estuaries are of small dimensions in comparison with seas.\r\n\r\nThe absence of many fossil forms usually met with in marine strata,\r\naffords a useful negative indication of the fresh-water origin of a\r\nformation. For example, there are no sea-urchins, no corals, no\r\nchambered shells, such as the nautilus, nor microscopic Foraminifera in\r\nlacustrine or fluviatile deposits. In distinguishing the latter from\r\nformations accumulated in the sea, we are chiefly guided by the forms\r\nof the mollusca. In a fresh-water deposit, the number of individual\r\nshells is often as great as in a marine stratum, if not greater; but\r\nthere is a smaller variety of species and genera. This might be\r\nanticipated from the fact that the genera and species of recent\r\nfresh-water and land shells are few when contrasted with the marine.\r\nThus, the genera of true mollusca according to Woodward’s system,\r\nexcluding those altogether extinct and those without shells, amount to\r\n446 in number, of which the terrestrial and fresh-water genera scarcely\r\nform more than a fifth.[1]\r\n\r\nFig. 18: Cyrena obovata. Fig. 19: Cyrena fluminatis.\r\n\r\nFig. 20: Anodonta Cordierii. Fig. 21: Anodonta latimarginata. Fig. 22:\r\nUnio littoralis.\r\n\r\nAlmost all bivalve shells, or those of acephalous mollusca, are marine,\r\nabout sixteen only out of 140 genera being fresh-water. Among these\r\nlast, the four most common forms, both recent and fossil, are _Cyclas,\r\nCyrena, Unio,_ and _Anodonta_ (see Figures); the two first and two last\r\nof which are so nearly allied as to pass into each other.\r\n\r\nFig. 23: Gryphæa incurva.\r\n\r\nLamarck divided the bivalve mollusca into the Dimyary, or those having\r\ntwo large muscular impressions in each valve, as _a b_ in the Cyclas,\r\nFig. 18, and Unio, Fig. 22, and the _ Monomyary,_ such as the oyster\r\nand scallop, in which there is only one of these impressions, as is\r\nseen in Fig. 23. Now, as none of these last, or the unimuscular\r\nbivalves, are fresh-water,[2] we may at once presume a deposit\r\ncontaining any of them to be marine.\r\n\r\nFig. 24: Planorbis enomphalus. Fig. 25: Limnæa longiscala. Fig. 26:\r\nPauldina lenta. Fig. 27: Succinea amphibia. Fig. 28: Ancylus velletia.\r\nFig. 29: Valvata piscinalis. Fig. 30: Physa hypnorum. Fig. 31:\r\nAuricula.

Fig. 36: Nerita granulosa.\r\nThe univalve shells most characteristic of fresh-water deposits are,\r\n_Planorbis, Limnæa,_ and _Paludina._ (See Figures.) But to these are\r\noccasionally added _Physa, Succinea, Ancylus, Valvata, Melanopsis,\r\nMelania, Potamides,_ and _ Neritina_ (see Figures), the four last being\r\nusually found in estuaries.\r\n\r\nFig. 37: Potamides cinctus.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists include _Neritina_ (Fig. 35) and the marine _Nerita_\r\n(Fig. 36) in the same genus, it being scarcely possible to distinguish\r\nthe two by good generic characters. But, as a general rule, the\r\nfluviatile species are smaller, smoother, and more globular than the\r\nmarine; and they have never, like the _Neritæ,_ the inner margin of the\r\nouter lip toothed or crenulated. (See Fig. 36.)\r\n\r\nThe Potamides inhabit the mouths of rivers in warm latitudes, and are\r\ndistinguishable from the marine Cerithia by their orbicular and\r\nmultispiral opercula. The genus Auricula (Fig. 31) is amphibious,\r\nfrequenting swamps and marshes within the influence of the tide.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial shells are all univalves. The most important genera\r\namong these, both in a recent and fossil state, are _ Helix_ (Fig. 38),\r\n_Cyclostoma_ (Fig. 39), _Pupa_ (Fig. 40), _Clausilia_ (Fig. 41),\r\n_Bulimus_ (Fig. 42), _ Glandina_ and _Achatina._\r\n\r\nFig. 38: Helix Turomensis. Fig. 39: Cyclostoma elegans. Fig. 40: Pupa\r\ntridens. Fig. 41: Clausilia bidens. Fig. 42: Bulimus lubricus.\r\n\r\n_Ampullaria_ (Fig. 43) is another genus of shells inhabiting rivers and\r\nponds in hot countries. Many fossil species formerly referred to this\r\ngenus, and which have been met with chiefly in marine formations, are\r\nnow considered by conchologists to belong to _Natica_ and other marine\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nFig. 43: Ampullaria glauca.\r\nAll univalve shells of land and fresh-water species, with the exception\r\nof _Melanopsis_ (Fig. 34), and _Achatina,_ which has a slight\r\nindentation, have entire mouths; and this circumstance may often serve\r\nas a convenient rule for distinguishing fresh-water from marine strata;\r\nsince, if any univalves occur of which the mouths are not entire, we\r\nmay presume that the formation is marine. The aperture is said to be\r\nentire in such shells as the fresh-water _Ampullaria_ and the\r\nland-shells (Figs 38-42), when its outline is not interrupted by an\r\nindentation or notch, such as that seen at _b_ in _ Ancillaria_ (Fig.\r\n45); or is not prolonged into a canal, as that seen at _a_ in\r\n_Pleurotoma_ (Fig. 44).\r\n\r\nFig. 44: Pleurotoma exorta. Fig. 45: Ancillaria subulata.\r\n\r\nThe mouths of a large proportion of the marine univalves have these\r\nnotches or canals, and almost all species are carnivorous; whereas\r\nnearly all testacea having entire mouths are plant-eaters, whether the\r\nspecies be marine, fresh-water, or terrestrial.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one genus which affords an occasional exception to\r\none of the above rules. The _Potamides_ (Fig. 37), a subgenus of\r\nCerithium, although provided with a short canal, comprises some species\r\nwhich inhabit salt, others brackish, and others fresh-water, and they\r\nare said to be all plant-eaters.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossils very common in fresh-water deposits are the shells of\r\n_Cypris,_ a minute bivalve crustaceous animal.[3] Many minute living\r\nspecies of this genus swarm in lakes and stagnant pools in Great\r\nBritain; but their shells are not, if considered separately, conclusive\r\nas to the fresh-water origin of a deposit, because the majority of\r\nspecies in another kindred genus of the same order, the _Cytherina_ of\r\nLamarck, inhabit salt-water; and, although the animal differs slightly,\r\nthe shell is scarcely distinguishable from that of the Cypris.\r\n\r\nFresh-water Fossil Plants.—The seed-vessels and stems of _ Chara,_ a\r\ngenus of aquatic plants, are very frequent in fresh-water strata. These\r\nseed-vessels were called, before their true nature was known,\r\ngyrogonites, and were supposed to be foraminiferous shells. (See Fig.\r\n46, _a_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Charæ_ inhabit the bottom of lakes and ponds, and flourish mostly\r\nwhere the water is charged with carbonate of lime. Their seed-vessels\r\nare covered with a very tough integument, capable of resisting\r\ndecomposition; to which circumstance we may attribute their abundance\r\nin a fossil state. The annexed figure (Fig. 47) represents a branch of\r\none of many new species found by Professor Amici in the lakes of\r\nNorthern Italy. The seed-vessel in this plant is more globular than in\r\nthe British _Charæ,_) and therefore more nearly resembles in form the\r\nextinct fossil species found in England, France, and other countries.\r\nThe stems, as well as the seed-vessels, of these plants occur both in\r\nmodern shell-marl and in ancient fresh-water formations. They are\r\ngenerally composed of a large central tube surrounded by smaller ones;\r\nthe whole stem being divided at certain intervals by transverse\r\npartitions or joints. (See _b,_ Fig. 46.)\r\n\r\nFig. 46: Chara medicaginula. Fig. 47: Chara elastica.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to meet with layers of vegetable matter, impressions\r\nof leaves, and branches of trees, in strata containing fresh-water\r\nshells; and we also find occasionally the teeth and bones of land\r\nquadrupeds, of species now unknown. The manner in which such remains\r\nare occasionally carried by rivers into lakes, especially during\r\nfloods, has been fully treated of in the “Principles of Geology.”\r\n\r\nFresh-water and Marine Fish.—The remains of fish are occasionally\r\nuseful in determining the fresh-water origin of strata. Certain genera,\r\nsuch as carp, perch, pike, and loach (_Cyprinus, Perca, Esox,_ and\r\n_Cobitis_), as also _Lebias,_ being peculiar to fresh-water. Other\r\ngenera contain some fresh-water and some marine species, as _Cottus,\r\nMugil,_ and _Anguilla,_ or eel. The rest are either common to rivers\r\nand the sea, as the salmon; or are exclusively characteristic of\r\nsalt-water. The above observations respecting fossil fishes are\r\napplicable only to the more modern or tertiary deposits; for in the\r\nmore ancient rocks the forms depart so widely from those of existing\r\nfishes, that it is very difficult, at least in the present state of\r\nscience, to derive any positive information from ichthyolites\r\nrespecting the element in which strata were deposited.\r\n\r\nThe alternation of marine and fresh-water formations, both on a small\r\nand large scale, are facts well ascertained in geology. When it occurs\r\non a small scale, it may have arisen from the alternate occupation of\r\ncertain spaces by river-water and the sea; for in the flood season the\r\nriver forces back the ocean and freshens it over a large area,\r\ndepositing at the same time its sediment; after which the salt-water\r\nagain returns, and, on resuming its former place, brings with it sand,\r\nmud, and marine shells.\r\n\r\nThere are also lagoons at the mouth of many rivers, as the Nile and\r\nMississippi, which are divided off by bars of sand from the sea, and\r\nwhich are filled with salt and fresh water by turns. They often\r\ncommunicate exclusively with the river for months, years, or even\r\ncenturies; and then a breach being made in the bar of sand, they are\r\nfor long periods filled with salt-water.\r\n\r\nLym-Fiord.—The Lym-Fiord in Jutland offers an excellent illustration of\r\nanalogous changes; for, in the course of the last thousand years, the\r\nwestern extremity of this long frith, which is 120 miles in length,\r\nincluding its windings, has been four times fresh and four times salt,\r\na bar of sand between it and the ocean having been often formed and\r\nremoved. The last irruption of salt water happened in 1824, when the\r\nNorth Sea entered, killing all the fresh-water shells, fish, and\r\nplants; and from that time to the present, the sea-weed _Fucus\r\nvesiculosus,_ together with oysters and other marine mollusca, have\r\nsucceeded the _Cyclas, Lymnæa, Paludina,_ and _Charæ._[4]\r\n\r\nBut changes like these in the Lym-Fiord, and those before mentioned as\r\noccurring at the mouths of great rivers, will only account for some\r\ncases of marine deposits of partial extent resting on fresh-water\r\nstrata. When we find, as in the south-east of England (Chapter XVIII),\r\na great series of fresh-water beds, 1000 feet in thickness, resting\r\nupon marine formations and again covered by other rocks, such as the\r\nCretaceous, more than 1000 feet thick, and of deep-sea origin, we shall\r\nfind it necessary to seek for a different explanation of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n [1] See Woodward’s Manual of Mollusca, 1856.\r\n\r\n [2] The fresh-water Mulleria, when young, forms a single exception to\r\n the rule, as it then has two muscular impressions, but it has only one\r\n in the adult state.\r\n\r\n [3] For figures of fossil species of Purbeck, see Chapter XIX\r\n\r\n [4] See Principles, Index, “Lym-Fiord.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nCONSOLIDATION OF STRATA AND PETRIFACTION OF FOSSILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical and Mechanical Deposits. — Cementing together of Particles. —\r\nHardening by Exposure to Air. — Concretionary Nodules. — Consolidating\r\nEffects of Pressure. — Mineralization of Organic Remains. — Impressions\r\nand Casts: how formed. — Fossil Wood. — Goppert’s Experiments. —\r\nPrecipitation of Stony Matter most rapid where Putrefaction is going\r\non. — Sources of Lime and Silex in Solution.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken in the preceding chapters of the characters of\r\nsedimentary formations, both as dependent on the deposition of\r\ninorganic matter and the distribution of fossils, I may next treat of\r\nthe consolidation of stratified rocks, and the petrifaction of imbedded\r\norganic remains.\r\n\r\nChemical and Mechanical Deposits.— A distinction has been made by\r\ngeologists between deposits of a mechanical, and those of a chemical,\r\norigin. By the name mechanical are designated beds of mud, sand, or\r\npebbles produced by the action of running water, also accumulations of\r\nstones and scoriæ thrown out by a volcano, which have fallen into their\r\npresent place by the force of gravitation. But the matter which forms a\r\nchemical deposit has not been mechanically suspended in water, but in a\r\nstate of solution until separated by chemical action. In this manner\r\ncarbonate of lime is occasionally precipitated upon the bottom of lakes\r\nin a solid form, as may be well seen in many parts of Italy, where\r\nmineral springs abound, and where the calcareous stone, called\r\ntravertin, is deposited. In these springs the lime is usually held in\r\nsolution by an excess of carbonic acid, or by heat if it be a hot\r\nspring, until the water, on issuing from the earth, cools or loses part\r\nof its acid. The calcareous matter then falls down in a solid state,\r\nincrusting shells, fragments of wood and leaves, and binding them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThat similar travertin is formed at some points in the bed of the sea\r\nwhere calcareous springs issue cannot be doubted, but as a general rule\r\nthe quantity of lime, according to Bischoff, spread through the waters\r\nof the ocean is very small, the free carbonic acid gas in the same\r\nwaters being five times as much as is necessary to keep the lime in a\r\nfluid state. Carbonate of lime, therefore, can rarely be precipitated\r\nat the bottom of the sea by chemical action alone, but must be produced\r\nby vital agency as in the case of coral reefs.\r\n\r\nIn such reefs, large masses of limestone are formed by the stony\r\nskeletons of zoophytes; and these, together with shells, become\r\ncemented together by carbonate of lime, part of which is probably\r\nfurnished to the sea-water by the decomposition of dead corals. Even\r\nshells, of which the animals are still living on these reefs, are very\r\ncommonly found to be incrusted over with a hard coating of limestone.\r\n\r\nIf sand and pebbles are carried by a river into the sea, and these are\r\nbound together immediately by carbonate of lime, the deposit may be\r\ndescribed as of a mixed origin, partly chemical, and partly mechanical.\r\n\r\nNow, the remarks already made in Chapter II, on the original\r\nhorizontality of strata are strictly applicable to mechanical deposits,\r\nand only partially to those of a mixed nature. Such as are purely\r\nchemical may be formed on a very steep slope, or may even incrust the\r\nvertical walls of a fissure, and be of equal thickness throughout; but\r\nsuch deposits are of small extent, and for the most part confined to\r\nvein-stones.\r\n\r\nConsolidation of Strata.—It is chiefly in the case of calcareous rocks\r\nthat solidification takes place at the time of deposition. But there\r\nare many deposits in which a cementing process comes into operation\r\nlong afterwards. We may sometimes observe, where the water of\r\nferruginous or calcareous springs has flowed through a bed of sand or\r\ngravel, that iron or carbonate of lime has been deposited in the\r\ninterstices between the grains or pebbles, so that in certain places\r\nthe whole has been bound together into a stone, the same set of strata\r\nremaining in other parts loose and incoherent.\r\n\r\nProofs of a similar cementing action are seen in a rock at Kelloway, in\r\nWiltshire. A peculiar band of sandy strata belonging to the group\r\ncalled Oolite by geologists may be traced through several counties, the\r\nsand being for the most part loose and unconsolidated, but becoming\r\nstony near Kelloway. In this district there are numerous fossil shells\r\nwhich have decomposed, having for the most part left only their casts.\r\nThe calcareous matter hence derived has evidently served, at some\r\nformer period, as a cement to the siliceous grains of sand, and thus a\r\nsolid sandstone has been produced. If we take fragments of many other\r\nargillaceous grits, retaining the casts of shells, and plunge them into\r\ndilute muriatic or other acid, we see them immediately changed into\r\ncommon sand and mud; the cement of lime, derived from the shells,\r\nhaving been dissolved by the acid.\r\n\r\nTraces of impressions and casts are often extremely faint. In some\r\nloose sands of recent date we meet with shells in so advanced a stage\r\nof decomposition as to crumble into powder when touched. It is clear\r\nthat water percolating such strata may soon remove the calcareous\r\nmatter of the shell; and unless circumstances cause the carbonate of\r\nlime to be again deposited, the grains of sand will not be cemented\r\ntogether; in which case no memorial of the fossil will remain.\r\n\r\nIn what manner silex and carbonate of lime may become widely diffused\r\nin small quantities through the waters which permeate the earth’s crust\r\nwill be spoken of presently, when the petrifaction of fossil bodies is\r\nconsidered; but I may remark here that such waters are always passing\r\nin the case of thermal springs from hotter to colder parts of the\r\ninterior of the earth; and, as often as the temperature of the solvent\r\nis lowered, mineral matter has a tendency to separate from it and\r\nsolidify. Thus a stony cement is often supplied to sand, pebbles, or\r\nany fragmentary mixture. In some conglomerates, like the pudding-stone\r\nof Hertfordshire (a Lower Eocene deposit), pebbles of flint and grains\r\nof sand are united by a siliceous cement so firmly, that if a block be\r\nfractured, the rent passes as readily through the pebbles as through\r\nthe cement.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many strata became solid at the time when they\r\nemerged from the waters in which they were deposited, and when they\r\nfirst formed a part of the dry land. A well-known fact seems to confirm\r\nthis idea: by far the greater number of the stones used for building\r\nand road-making are much softer when first taken from the quarry than\r\nafter they have been long exposed to the air; and these, when once\r\ndried, may afterwards be immersed for any length of time in water\r\nwithout becoming soft again. Hence it is found desirable to shape the\r\nstones which are to be used in architecture while they are yet soft and\r\nwet, and while they contain their “quarry-water,” as it is called; also\r\nto break up stone intended for roads when soft, and then leave it to\r\ndry in the air for months that it may harden. Such induration may\r\nperhaps be accounted for by supposing the water, which penetrates the\r\nminutest pores of rocks, to deposit, on evaporation, carbonate of lime,\r\niron, silex, and other minerals previously held in solution, and\r\nthereby to fill up the pores partially. These particles, on\r\ncrystallising, would not only be themselves deprived of freedom of\r\nmotion, but would also bind together other portions of the rock which\r\nbefore were loosely aggregated. On the same principle wet sand and mud\r\nbecome as hard as stone when frozen; because one ingredient of the\r\nmass, namely, the water, has crystallised, so as to hold firmly\r\ntogether all the separate particles of which the loose mud and sand\r\nwere composed.\r\n\r\nDr. MacCulloch mentions a sandstone in Skye, which may be moulded like\r\ndough when first found; and some simple minerals, which are rigid and\r\nas hard as glass in our cabinets, are often flexible and soft in their\r\nnative beds: this is the case with asbestos, sahlite, tremolite, and\r\nchalcedony, and it is reported also to happen in the case of the\r\nberyl.[1]\r\n\r\nThe marl recently deposited at the bottom of Lake Superior, in North\r\nAmerica, is soft, and often filled with fresh-water shells; but if a\r\npiece be taken up and dried, it becomes so hard that it can only be\r\nbroken by a smart blow of the hammer. If the lake, therefore, was\r\ndrained, such a deposit would be found to consist of strata of\r\nmarlstone, like that observed in many ancient European formations, and,\r\nlike them, containing fresh-water shells.\r\n\r\nFig. 48: Calcareous nodules in Lias.\r\nConcretionary Structure.—It is probable that some of the heterogeneous\r\nmaterials which rivers transport to the sea may at once set under\r\nwater, like the artificial mixture called pozzolana, which consists of\r\nfine volcanic sand charged with about twenty per cent of oxide of iron,\r\nand the addition of a small quantity of lime. This substance hardens,\r\nand becomes a solid stone in water, and was used by the Romans in\r\nconstructing the foundations of buildings in the sea. Consolidation in\r\nsuch cases is brought about by the action of chemical affinity on\r\nfinely comminuted matter previously suspended in water. After\r\ndeposition similar particles seem often to exert a mutual attraction on\r\neach other, and congregate together in particular spots, forming lumps,\r\nnodules, and concretions. Thus in many argillaceous deposits there are\r\ncalcareous balls, or spherical concretions, ranged in layers parallel\r\nto the general stratification; an arrangement which took place after\r\nthe shale or marl had been thrown down in successive laminæ; for these\r\nlaminæ are often traceable through the concretions, remaining parallel\r\nto those of the surrounding unconsolidated rock. (See Fig. 48.) Such\r\nnodules of limestone have often a shell or other foreign body in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable examples of concretionary structure are those\r\ndescribed by Professor Sedgwick as abounding in the magnesian limestone\r\nof the north of England. The spherical balls are of various sizes, from\r\nthat of a pea to a diameter of several feet, and they have both a\r\nconcentric and radiated structure, while at the same time the laminæ of\r\noriginal deposition pass uninterruptedly through them. In some cliffs\r\nthis limestone resembles a great irregular pile of cannon-balls. Some\r\nof the globular masses have their centre in one stratum, while a\r\nportion of their exterior passes through to the stratum above or below.\r\nThus the larger spheroid in the section (Fig. 49) passes from the\r\nstratum _b_ upward into _a._ In this instance we must suppose the\r\ndeposition of a series of minor layers, first forming the stratum _b,_\r\nand afterwards the incumbent stratum _a_; then a movement of the\r\nparticles took place, and the carbonates of lime and magnesia separated\r\nfrom the more impure and mixed matter forming the still unconsolidated\r\nparts of the stratum. Crystallisation, beginning at the centre, must\r\nhave gone on forming concentric coats around the original nucleus\r\nwithout interfering with the laminated structure of the rock.\r\n\r\nFig. 49: Spheroidal concretions in magnesian limestone. Fig. 50:\r\nSection through strata of grit.\r\nWhen the particles of rocks have been thus rearranged by chemical\r\nforces, it is sometimes difficult or impossible to ascertain whether\r\ncertain lines of division are due to original deposition or to the\r\nsubsequent aggregation of several particles. Thus suppose three strata\r\nof grit, A, B, C, are charged unequally with calcareous matter, and\r\nthat B is the most calcareous. If consolidation takes place in B, the\r\nconcretionary action may spread upward into a part of A, where the\r\ncarbonate of lime is more abundant than in the rest; so that a mass, _d\r\ne f,_ forming a portion of the superior stratum, becomes united with B\r\ninto one solid mass of stone. The original line of division, _d e,_\r\nbeing thus effaced, the line _d f_ would generally be considered as the\r\nsurface of the bed B, though not strictly a true plane of\r\nstratification.\r\n\r\nPressure and Heat.—When sand and mud sink to the bottom of a deep sea,\r\nthe particles are not pressed down by the enormous weight of the\r\nincumbent ocean; for the water, which becomes mingled with the sand and\r\nmud, resists pressure with a force equal to that of the column of fluid\r\nabove. The same happens in regard to organic remains which are filled\r\nwith water under great pressure as they sink, otherwise they would be\r\nimmediately crushed to pieces and flattened. Nevertheless, if the\r\nmaterials of a stratum remain in a yielding state, and do not set or\r\nsolidify, they will be gradually squeezed down by the weight of other\r\nmaterials successively heaped upon them, just as soft clay or loose\r\nsand on which a house is built may give way. By such downward pressure\r\nparticles of clay, sand, and marl may become packed into a smaller\r\nspace, and be made to cohere together permanently.\r\n\r\nAnalogous effects of condensation may arise when the solid parts of the\r\nearth’s crust are forced in various directions by those mechanical\r\nmovements hereafter to be described, by which strata have been bent,\r\nbroken, and raised above the level of the sea. Rocks of more yielding\r\nmaterials must often have been forced against others previously\r\nconsolidated, and may thus by compression have acquired a new\r\nstructure. A recent discovery may help us to comprehend how fine\r\nsediment derived from the detritus of rocks may be solidified by mere\r\npressure. The graphite or “black lead” of commerce having become very\r\nscarce, Mr. Brockedon contrived a method by which the dust of the purer\r\nportions of the mineral found in Borrowdale might be recomposed into a\r\nmass as dense and compact as native graphite. The powder of graphite is\r\nfirst carefully prepared and freed from air, and placed under a\r\npowerful press on a strong steel die, with air-tight fittings. It is\r\nthen struck several blows, each of a power of 1000 tons; after which\r\noperation the powder is so perfectly solidified that it can be cut for\r\npencils, and exhibits when broken the same texture as native graphite.\r\n\r\nBut the action of heat at various depths in the earth is probably the\r\nmost powerful of all causes in hardening sedimentary strata. To this\r\nsubject I shall refer again when treating of the metamorphic rocks, and\r\nof the slaty and jointed structure.\r\n\r\nMineralisation of Organic Remains.—The changes which fossil organic\r\nbodies have undergone since they were first imbedded in rocks, throw\r\nmuch light on the consolidation of strata. Fossil shells in some modern\r\ndeposits have been scarcely altered in the course of centuries, having\r\nsimply lost a part of their animal matter. But in other cases the shell\r\nhas disappeared, and left an impression only of its exterior, or,\r\nsecondly, a cast of its interior form, or, thirdly, a cast of the shell\r\nitself, the original matter of which has been removed. These different\r\nforms of fossilisation may easily be understood if we examine the mud\r\nrecently thrown out from a pond or canal in which there are shells. If\r\nthe mud be argillaceous, it acquires consistency on drying, and on\r\nbreaking open a portion of it we find that each shell has left\r\nimpressions of its external form. If we then remove the shell itself,\r\nwe find within a solid nucleus of clay, having the form of the interior\r\nof the shell. This form is often very different from that of the outer\r\nshell. Thus a cast such as _a,_ Fig. 51, commonly called a fossil\r\nscrew, would never be suspected by an inexperienced conchologist to be\r\nthe internal shape of the fossil univalve, _ b,_ Fig. 51. Nor should we\r\nhave imagined at first sight that the shell a and the cast _b,_ Fig.\r\n52, belong to one and the same fossil. The reader will observe, in the\r\nlast-mentioned figure (_b,_ Fig. 52), that an empty space shaded dark,\r\nwhich the _ shell itself_ once occupied, now intervenes between the\r\nenveloping stone and the cast of the smooth interior of the whorls. In\r\nsuch cases the shell has been dissolved and the component particles\r\nremoved by water percolating the rock. If the nucleus were taken out, a\r\nhollow mould would remain, on which the external form of the shell with\r\nits tubercles and striæ, as seen in _a,_ Fig. 52, would be seen\r\nembossed. Now if the space alluded to between the nucleus and the\r\nimpression, instead of being left empty, has been filled up with\r\ncalcareous spar, flint, pyrites, or other mineral, we then obtain from\r\nthe mould an exact cast both of the external and internal form of the\r\noriginal shell. In this manner silicified casts of shells have been\r\nformed; and if the mud or sand of the nucleus happen to be incoherent,\r\nor soluble in acid, we can then procure in flint an empty shell, which\r\nin shape is the exact counterpart of the original. This cast may be\r\ncompared to a bronze statue, representing merely the superficial form,\r\nand not the internal organisation; but there is another description of\r\npetrifaction by no means uncommon, and of a much more wonderful kind,\r\nwhich may be compared to certain anatomical models in wax, where not\r\nonly the outward forms and features, but the nerves, blood-vessels, and\r\nother internal organs are also shown. Thus we find corals, originally\r\ncalcareous, in which not only the general shape, but also the minute\r\nand complicated internal organisation is retained in flint.\r\n\r\nFig. 51: Phasianella Heddingtonensis. Fig. 52: Pleurotomaria Anglica.\r\n\r\nFig. 53: Section of a tree from the coal-measures.\r\n\r\nSuch a process of petrifaction is still more remarkably exhibited in\r\nfossil wood, in which we often perceive not only the rings of annual\r\ngrowth, but all the minute vessels and medullary rays. Many of the\r\nminute cells and fibres of plants, and even those spiral vessels which\r\nin the living vegetable can only be discovered by the microscope, are\r\npreserved. Among many instances, I may mention a fossil tree,\r\nseventy-two feet in length, found at Gosforth, near Newcastle, in\r\nsandstone strata associated with coal. By cutting a transverse slice so\r\nthin as to transmit light, and magnifying it about fifty-five times,\r\nthe texture, as seen in Fig. 53, is exhibited. A texture equally minute\r\nand complicated has been observed in the wood of large trunks of fossil\r\ntrees found in the Craigleith quarry near Edinburgh, where the stone\r\nwas not in the slightest degree siliceous, but consisted chiefly of\r\ncarbonate of lime, with oxide of iron, alumina, and carbon. The\r\nparallel rows of vessels here seen are the rings of annual growth, but\r\nin one part they are imperfectly preserved, the wood having probably\r\ndecayed before the mineralising matter had penetrated to that portion\r\nof the tree.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to explain the process of petrifaction in such cases, we\r\nmay first assume that strata are very generally permeated by water\r\ncharged with minute portions of calcareous, siliceous, and other earths\r\nin solution. In what manner they become so impregnated will be\r\nafterwards considered. If an organic substance is exposed in the open\r\nair to the action of the sun and rain, it will in time putrefy, or be\r\ndissolved into its component elements, consisting usually of oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. These will readily be absorbed by the\r\natmosphere or be washed away by rain, so that all vestiges of the dead\r\nanimal or plant disappear. But if the same substances be submerged in\r\nwater, they decompose more gradually; and if buried in earth, still\r\nmore slowly; as in the familiar example of wooden piles or other buried\r\ntimber. Now, if as fast as each particle is set free by putrefaction in\r\na fluid or gaseous state, a particle equally minute of carbonate of\r\nlime, flint, or other mineral, is at hand ready to be precipitated, we\r\nmay imagine this inorganic matter to take the place just before left\r\nunoccupied by the organic molecule. In this manner a cast of the\r\ninterior of certain vessels may first be taken, and afterwards the more\r\nsolid walls of the same may decay and suffer a like transmutation. Yet\r\nwhen the whole is lapidified, it may not form one homogeneous mass of\r\nstone or metal. Some of the original ligneous, osseous, or other\r\norganic elements may remain mingled in certain parts, or the\r\nlapidifying substance itself may be differently coloured at different\r\ntimes, or so crystallised as to reflect light differently, and thus the\r\ntexture of the original body may be faithfully exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe student may perhaps ask whether, on chemical principles, we have\r\nany ground to expect that mineral matter will be thrown down precisely\r\nin those spots where organic decomposition is in progress? The\r\nfollowing curious experiments may serve to illustrate this point:\r\nProfessor Goppert of Breslau, with a view of imitating the natural\r\nprocess of petrifaction, steeped a variety of animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances in waters, some holding siliceous, others calcareous, others\r\nmetallic matter in solution. He found that in the period of a few\r\nweeks, or sometimes even days, the organic bodies thus immersed were\r\nmineralised to a certain extent. Thus, for example, thin vertical\r\nslices of deal, taken from the Scotch fir (_Pinus sylvestris_), were\r\nimmersed in a moderately strong solution of sulphate of iron. When they\r\nhad been thoroughly soaked in the liquid for several days they were\r\ndried and exposed to a red-heat until the vegetable matter was burnt up\r\nand nothing remained but an oxide of iron, which was found to have\r\ntaken the form of the deal so exactly that casts even of the dotted\r\nvessels peculiar to this family of plants were distinctly visible under\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Turner observes, that when mineral matter is in a “nascent\r\nstate,” that is to say, just liberated from a previous state of\r\nchemical combination, it is most ready to unite with other matter, and\r\nform a new chemical compound. Probably the particles or atoms just set\r\nfree are of extreme minuteness, and therefore move more freely, and are\r\nmore ready to obey any impulse of chemical affinity. Whatever be the\r\ncause, it clearly follows, as before stated, that where organic matter\r\nnewly imbedded in sediment is decomposing, there will chemical changes\r\ntake place most actively.\r\n\r\nAn analysis was lately made of the water which was flowing off from the\r\nrich mud deposited by the Hooghly River in the Delta of the Ganges\r\nafter the annual inundation. This water was found to be highly charged\r\nwith carbonic acid holding lime in solution.[2] Now if newly-deposited\r\nmud is thus proved to be permeated by mineral matter in a state of\r\nsolution, it is not difficult to perceive that decomposing organic\r\nbodies, naturally imbedded in sediment, may as readily become petrified\r\nas the substances artificially immersed by Professor Goppert in various\r\nfluid mixtures.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the waters of all springs are more or less\r\ncharged with earthy, alkaline, or metallic ingredients derived from the\r\nrocks and mineral veins through which they percolate. Silex is\r\nespecially abundant in hot springs, and carbonate of lime is almost\r\nalways present in greater or less quantity. The materials for the\r\npetrifaction of organic remains are, therefore, usually at hand in a\r\nstate of chemical solution wherever organic remains are imbedded in new\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n [1] Dr. MacCulloch, Syst. of Geol., vol. i, p. 123.\r\n\r\n [2] Piddington, Asiat.

Hence it follows, that what\r\nis now dry land was once under water. But if we admit this conclusion,\r\nwe must imagine, either that there has been a general lowering of the\r\nwaters of the ocean, or that the solid rocks, once covered by water,\r\nhave been raised up bodily out of the sea, and have thus become dry\r\nland. The earlier geologists, finding themselves reduced to this\r\nalternative, embraced the former opinion, assuming that the ocean was\r\noriginally universal, and had gradually sunk down to its actual level,\r\nso that the present islands and continents were left dry. It seemed to\r\nthem far easier to conceive that the water had gone down, than that\r\nsolid land had risen upward into its present position. It was, however,\r\nimpossible to invent any satisfactory hypothesis to explain the\r\ndisappearance of so enormous a body of water throughout the globe, it\r\nbeing necessary to infer that the ocean had once stood at whatever\r\nheight marine shells might be detected. It moreover appeared clear, as\r\nthe science of geology advanced, that certain spaces on the globe had\r\nbeen alternately sea, then land, then estuary, then sea again, and,\r\nlastly, once more habitable land, having remained in each of these\r\nstates for considerable periods. In order to account for such phenomena\r\nwithout admitting any movement of the land itself, we are required to\r\nimagine several retreats and returns of the ocean; and even then our\r\ntheory applies merely to cases where the marine strata composing the\r\ndry land are horizontal, leaving unexplained those more common\r\ninstances where strata are inclined, curved, or placed on their edges,\r\nand evidently not in the position in which they were first deposited.\r\n\r\nGeologists, therefore, were at last compelled to have recourse to the\r\ndoctrine that the solid land has been repeatedly moved upward or\r\ndownward, so as permanently to change its position relatively to the\r\nsea. There are several distinct grounds for preferring this conclusion.\r\nFirst, it will account equally for the position of those elevated\r\nmasses of marine origin in which the stratification remains horizontal,\r\nand for those in which the strata are disturbed, broken, inclined, or\r\nvertical. Secondly, it is consistent with human experience that land\r\nshould rise gradually in some places and be depressed in others. Such\r\nchanges have actually occurred in our own days, and are now in\r\nprogress, having been accompanied in some cases by violent convulsions,\r\nwhile in others they have proceeded so insensibly as to have been\r\nascertainable only by the most careful scientific observations, made at\r\nconsiderable intervals of time. On the other hand, there is no evidence\r\nfrom human experience of a rising or lowering of the sea’s level in any\r\nregion, and the ocean cannot be raised or depressed in one place\r\nwithout its level being changed all over the globe.\r\n\r\nThese preliminary remarks will prepare the reader to understand the\r\ngreat theoretical interest attached to all facts connected with the\r\nposition of strata, whether horizontal or inclined, curved or vertical.\r\n\r\nNow the first and most simple appearance is where strata of marine\r\norigin occur above the level of the sea in horizontal position. Such\r\nare the strata which we meet with in the south of Sicily, filled with\r\nshells for the most part of the same species as those now living in the\r\nMediterranean. Some of these rocks rise to the height of more than 2000\r\nfeet above the sea. Other mountain masses might be mentioned, composed\r\nof horizontal strata of high antiquity, which contain fossil remains of\r\nanimals wholly dissimilar from any now known to exist. In the south of\r\nSweden, for example, near Lake Wener, the beds of some of the oldest\r\nfossiliferous deposits, called Silurian and Cambrian by geologists,\r\noccur in as level a position as if they had recently formed part of the\r\ndelta of a great river, and been left dry on the retiring of the annual\r\nfloods. Aqueous rocks of equal antiquity extend for hundreds of miles\r\nover the lake-district of North America, and exhibit in like manner a\r\nstratification nearly undisturbed. The Table Mountain at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope is another example of highly elevated yet perfectly\r\nhorizontal strata, no less than 3500 feet in thickness, and consisting\r\nof sandstone of very ancient date.\r\n\r\nInstead of imagining that such fossiliferous rocks were always at their\r\npresent level, and that the sea was once high enough to cover them, we\r\nsuppose them to have constituted the ancient bed of the ocean, and to\r\nhave been afterwards uplifted to their present height. This idea,\r\nhowever startling it may at first appear, is quite in accordance, as\r\nbefore stated, with the analogy of changes now going on in certain\r\nregions of the globe. Thus, in parts of Sweden, and the shores and\r\nislands of the Gulf of Bothnia, proofs have been obtained that the land\r\nis experiencing, and has experienced for centuries, a slow upheaving\r\nmovement.[1]\r\n\r\nIt appears from the observations of Mr. Darwin and others, that very\r\nextensive regions of the continent of South America have been\r\nundergoing slow and gradual upheaval, by which the level plains of\r\nPatagonia, covered with recent marine shells, and the Pampas of Buenos\r\nAyres, have been raised above the level of the sea. On the other hand,\r\nthe gradual sinking of the west coast of Greenland, for the space of\r\nmore than 600 miles from north to south, during the last four\r\ncenturies, has been established by the observations of a Danish\r\nnaturalist, Dr. Pingel. And while these proofs of continental elevation\r\nand subsidence, by slow and insensible movements, have been recently\r\nbrought to light, the evidence has been daily strengthened of continued\r\nchanges of level effected by violent convulsions in countries where\r\nearthquakes are frequent. There the rocks are rent from time to time,\r\nand heaved up or thrown down several feet at once, and disturbed in\r\nsuch a manner as to show how entirely the original position of strata\r\nmay be modified in the course of centuries.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin has also inferred that, in those seas where circular coral\r\nislands and barrier reefs abound, there is a slow and continued sinking\r\nof the submarine mountains on which the masses of coral are based;\r\nwhile there are other areas of the South Sea where the land is on the\r\nrise, and where coral has been upheaved far above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nAlternations of Marine and Fresh-water Strata.—It has been shown in the\r\nthird chapter that there is such a differencebetween land, fresh-water,\r\nand marine fossils as to enable the geologist to determine whether\r\nparticular groups of strata were formed at the bottom of the ocean or\r\nin estuaries, rivers, or lakes. If surprise was at first created by the\r\ndiscovery of marine corals and shells at the height of several miles\r\nabove the sea-level, the imagination was afterwards not less startled\r\nby observing that in the successive strata composing the earth’s crust,\r\nespecially if their total thickness amounted to thousands of feet, they\r\ncomprised in some parts formations of shallow-sea as well as of\r\ndeep-sea origin; also beds of brackish or even of purely fresh-water\r\nformation, as well as vegetable matter or coal accumulated on ancient\r\nland. In these cases we as frequently find fresh-water beds below a\r\nmarine set or shallow-water under those of deep-sea origin as the\r\nreverse. Thus, if we bore an artesian well below London, we pass\r\nthrough a marine clay, and there reach, at the depth of several hundred\r\nfeet, a shallow-water and fluviatile sand, beneath which comes the\r\nwhite chalk originally formed in a deep sea. Or if we bore vertically\r\nthrough the chalk of the North Downs, we come, after traversing marine\r\nchalky strata, upon a fresh-water formation many hundreds of feet\r\nthick, called the Wealden, such as is seen in Kent and Surrey, which is\r\nknown in its turn to rest on purely marine beds. In like manner, in\r\nvarious parts of Great Britain we sink vertical shafts through marine\r\ndeposits of great thickness, and come upon coal which was formed by the\r\ngrowth of plants on an ancient land-surface sometimes hundreds of\r\nsquare miles in extent.\r\n\r\nVertical, Inclined, and Curved Strata.—It has been stated that marine\r\nstrata of different ages are sometimes found at a considerable height\r\nabove the sea, yet retaining their original horizontality; but this\r\nstate of things is quite exceptional. As a general rule, strata are\r\ninclined or bent in such a manner as to imply that their original\r\nposition has been altered.\r\n\r\nFig. 54: Vertical conglomerate and sandstone.\r\nThe most unequivocal evidence of such a change is afforded by their\r\nstanding up vertically, showing their edges, which is by no means a\r\nrare phenomenon, especially in mountainous countries. Thus we find in\r\nScotland, on the southern skirts of the Grampians, beds of\r\npudding-stone alternating with thin layers of fine sand, all placed\r\nvertically to the horizon. When Saussure first observed certain\r\nconglomerates in a similar position in the Swiss Alps, he remarked that\r\nthe pebbles, being for the most part of an oval shape, had their longer\r\naxes parallel to the planes of stratification (see Fig. 54 on preceding\r\npage). From this he inferred that such strata must, at first, have been\r\nhorizontal, each oval pebble having settled at the bottom of the water,\r\nwith its flatter side parallel to the horizon, for the same reason that\r\nan egg will not stand on either end if unsupported. Some few, indeed,\r\nof the rounded stones in a conglomerate occasionally afford an\r\nexception to the above rule, for the same reason that in a river’s bed,\r\nor on a shingle beach, some pebbles rest on their ends or edges; these\r\nhaving been shoved against or between other stones by a wave or\r\ncurrent, so as to assume this position.\r\n\r\nAnticlinal and Synclinal Curves.—Vertical strata, when they can be\r\ntraced continuously upward or downward for some depth, are almost\r\ninvariably seen to be parts of great curves, which may have a diameter\r\nof a few yards, or of several miles. I shall first describe two curves\r\nof considerable regularity, which occur in Forfarshire, extending over\r\na country twenty miles in breadth, from the foot of the Grampians to\r\nthe sea near Arbroath.\r\n\r\nFig. 55: Section of Forfarshire, from N.W. to S.E.\r\n\r\nThe mass of strata here shown may be 2000 feet in thickness, consisting\r\nof red and white sandstone, and various coloured shales, the beds being\r\ndistinguishable into four principal groups, namely, No. 1, red marl or\r\nshale; No. 2, red sandstone, used for building; No. 3, conglomerate;\r\nand No. 4, grey paving-stone, and tile-stone, with green and reddish\r\nshale, containing peculiar organic remains. A glance at the section\r\nwill show that each of the formations 2, 3, 4 are repeated thrice at\r\nthe surface, twice with a southerly, and once with a northerly\r\ninclination or _dip_, and the beds in No. 1, which are nearly\r\nhorizontal, are still brought up twice by a slight curvature to the\r\nsurface, once on each side of A. Beginning at the north-west extremity,\r\nthe tile-stones and conglomerates, No. 4 and No. 3, are vertical, and\r\nthey generally form a ridge parallel to the southern skirts of the\r\nGrampians. The superior strata, Nos. 2 and 1, become less and less\r\ninclined on descending to the valley of Strathmore, where the strata,\r\nhaving a concave bend, are said by geologists to lie in a “trough”\r\nor“basin.” Through the centre of this valley runs an imaginary line A,\r\ncalled technically a “synclinal line,” where the beds, which are tilted\r\nin opposite directions, may be supposed to meet. It is most important\r\nfor the observer to mark such lines, for he will perceive by the\r\ndiagram that, in travelling from the north to the centre of the basin,\r\nhe is always passing from older to newer beds; whereas, after crossing\r\nthe line A, and pursuing his course in the same southerly direction, he\r\nis continually leaving the newer, and advancing upon older strata. All\r\nthe deposits which he had before examined begin then to recur in\r\nreversed order, until he arrives at the central axis of the Sidlaw\r\nhills, where the strata are seen to form an arch, or _saddle_, having\r\nan _anticlinal_ line, B, in the centre. On passing this line, and\r\ncontinuing towards the S.E., the formations 4, 3, and 2, are again\r\nrepeated, in the same relative order of superposition, but with a\r\nsoutherly dip. At Whiteness (see Fig. 55) it will be seen that the\r\ninclined strata are covered by a newer deposit, _a_, in horizontal\r\nbeds. These are composed of red conglomerate and sand, and are newer\r\nthan any of the groups, 1, 2, 3, 4, before described, and rest\r\n_unconformably_ upon strata of the sandstone group, No. 2.\r\n\r\nAn example of curved strata, in which the bends or convolutions of the\r\nrock are sharper and far more numerous within an equal space, has been\r\nwell described by Sir James Hall.[2] It occurs near St. Abb’s Head, on\r\nthe east coast of Scotland, where the rocks consist principally of a\r\nbluish slate, having frequently a ripple-marked surface. The\r\nundulations of the beds reach from the top to the bottom of cliffs from\r\n200 to 300 feet in height, and there are sixteen distinct bendings in\r\nthe course of about six miles, the curvatures being alternately concave\r\nand convex upward.\r\n\r\nFolding by Lateral Movement.—An experiment was made by Sir James Hall,\r\nwith a view of illustrating the manner in which such strata, assuming\r\nthem to have been originally horizontal, may have been forced into\r\ntheir present position. A set of layers of clay were placed under a\r\nweight, and their opposite ends pressed towards each other with such\r\nforce as to cause them to approach more nearly together. On the removal\r\nof the weight, the layers of clay were found to be curved and folded,\r\nso as to bear a miniature resemblance to the strata in the cliffs. We\r\nmust, however, bear in mind that in the natural section or sea-cliff we\r\nonly see the foldings imperfectly, one part being invisible beneath the\r\nsea, and the other, or upper portion, being supposed to have been\r\ncarried away by _denudation_, or that action of water which will be\r\nexplained in the next chapter. The dark lines in the plan (Fig. 57)\r\nrepresent what is actually seen of the strata in the line of cliff\r\nalluded to; the fainter lines, that portion which is concealed beneath\r\nthe sea-level, as also that which is supposed to have once existed\r\nabove the present surface.\r\n\r\nFig. 56: Curved strata of slate near St. Abb’s Head, Berwickshire.\r\n\r\nFig. 57\r\n\r\nWe may still more easily illustrate the effects which a lateral thrust\r\nmight produce on flexible strata, by placing several pieces of\r\ndifferently coloured cloths upon a table, and when they are spread out\r\nhorizontally, cover them with a book. Then apply other books to each\r\nend, and force them towards each other. The folding of the cloths (see\r\nFig. 58) will imitate those of the bent strata; the incumbent book\r\nbeing slightly lifted up, and no longer touching the two volumes on\r\nwhich it rested before, because it is supported by the tops of the\r\nanticlinal ridges formed by the curved cloths. In like manner there can\r\nbe no doubt that the squeezed strata, although laterally condensed and\r\nmore closely packed, are yet elongated and made to rise upward, in a\r\ndirection perpendicular to the pressure.\r\n\r\nFig. 58\r\n\r\nWhether the analogous flexures in stratified rocks have really been due\r\nto similar sideway movements is a question which we can not decide by\r\nreference to our own observation. Our inability to explain the nature\r\nof the process is, perhaps, not simply owing to the inaccessibility of\r\nthe subterranean regions where the mechanical force is exerted, but to\r\nthe extreme slowness of the movement. The changes may sometimes be due\r\nto variation in the temperature of mountain masses of rock causing\r\nthem, while still solid, to expand or contract; or melting them, and\r\nthen again cooling them and allowing them to crystallise. If such be\r\nthe case, we have scarcely more reason to expect to witness the\r\noperation of the process within the limited periods of our scientific\r\nobservation than to see the swelling of the roots of a tree, by which,\r\nin the course of years, a wall of solid masonry may be lifted up, rent\r\nor thrown down. In both instances the force may be irresistible, but\r\nthough adequate, it need not be visible by us, provided the time\r\nrequired for its development be very great. The lateral pressure\r\narising from the unequal expansion of rocks by heat may cause one mass\r\nlying in the same horizontal plane gradually to occupy a larger space,\r\nso as to press upon another rock, which, if flexible, may be squeezed\r\ninto a bent and folded form. It will also appear, when the volcanic and\r\ngranitic rocks are described, that some of them have, when melted in\r\nthe interior of the earth’s crust, been injected forcibly into\r\nfissures, and after the solidification of such intruded matter, other\r\nsets of rents, crossing the first, have been formed and in their turn\r\nfilled by melted rock. Such repeated injections imply a stretching, and\r\noften upheaval, of the whole mass.\r\n\r\nWe also know, especially by the study of regions liable to earthquakes,\r\nthat there are causes at work in the interior of the earth capable of\r\nproducing a sinking in of the ground, sometimes very local, but often\r\nextending over a wide area. The continuance of such a downward\r\nmovement, especially if partial and confined to linear areas, may\r\nproduce regular folds in the strata.\r\n\r\nCreeps in Coal-mines.—The “creeps,” as they are called in coal-mines,\r\nafford an excellent illustration of this fact.—First, it may be stated\r\ngenerally, that the excavation of coal at a considerable depth causes\r\nthe mass of overlying strata to sink down bodily, even when props are\r\nleft to support the roof of the mine. “In Yorkshire,” says Mr. Buddle,\r\n“three distinct subsidences were perceptible at the surface, after the\r\nclearing out of three seams of coal below, and innumerable vertical\r\ncracks were caused in the incumbent mass of sandstone and shale which\r\nthus settled down.”[3] The exact amount of depression in these cases\r\ncan only be accurately measured where water accumulates on the surface,\r\nor a railway traverses a coal-field.\r\n\r\nWhen a bed of coal is worked out, pillars or rectangular masses of coal\r\nare left at intervals as props to support the roof, and protect the\r\ncolliers. Thus in Fig. 59, representing a section at Wallsend,\r\nNewcastle, the galleries which have been excavated are represented by\r\nthe white spaces _a, b,_ while the adjoining dark portions are parts of\r\nthe original coal seam left as props, beds of sandy clay or shale\r\nconstituting the floor of the mine. When the props have been reduced in\r\nsize, they are pressed down by the weight of overlying rocks (no less\r\nthan 630 feet thick) upon the shale below, which is thereby squeezed\r\nand forced up into the open spaces.\r\n\r\nNow it might have been expected that, instead of the floor rising up,\r\nthe ceiling would sink down, and this effect, called a “thrust,” does,\r\nin fact, take place where the pavement is more solid than the roof. But\r\nit usually happens, in coal-mines, that the roof is composed of hard\r\nshale, or occasionally of sandstone, more unyielding than the\r\nfoundation, which often consists of clay. Even where the argillaceous\r\nsubstrata are hard at first, they soon become softened and reduced to a\r\nplastic state when exposed to the contact of air and water in the floor\r\nof a mine.\r\n\r\nFig. 59: Section of carboniferous strata at Wallsend showing ‘creeps’.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of a “creep,” says Mr. Buddle, is a slight curvature\r\nat the bottom of each gallery, as at _a_, Fig. 59: then the pavement,\r\ncontinuing to rise, begins to open with a longitudinal crack, as at\r\n_b_; then the points of the fractured ridge reach the roof, as at _c_;\r\nand, lastly, the upraised beds close up the whole gallery, and the\r\nbroken portions of the ridge are reunited and flattened at the top,\r\nexhibiting the flexure seen at _d._ Meanwhile the coal in the props has\r\nbecome crushed and cracked by pressure. It is also found that below the\r\ncreeps _a, b, c, d,_ an inferior stratum, called the “metal coal,”\r\nwhich is 3 feet thick, has been fractured at the points _e, f, g, h,_\r\nand has risen, so as to prove that the upward movement, caused by the\r\nworking out of the “main coal,” has been propagated through a thickness\r\nof 54 feet of argillaceous beds, which intervene between the two\r\ncoal-seams. This same displacement has also been traced downward more\r\nthan 150 feet below the metal coal, but it grows continually less and\r\nless until it becomes imperceptible.\r\n\r\nNo part of the process above described is more deserving of our notice\r\nthan the slowness with which the change in the arrangement of the beds\r\nis brought about. Days, months, or even years, will sometimes elapse\r\nbetween the first bending of the pavement and the time of its reaching\r\nthe roof. Where the movement has been most rapid, the curvature of the\r\nbeds is most regular, and the reunion of the fractured ends most\r\ncomplete; whereas the signs of displacement or violence are greatest in\r\nthose creeps which have required months or years for their entire\r\naccomplishment. Hence we may conclude that similar changes may have\r\nbeen wrought on a larger scale in the earth’s crust by partial and\r\ngradual subsidences, especially where the ground has been undermined\r\nthroughout long periods of time; and we must be on our guard against\r\ninferring sudden violence, simply because the distortion of the beds is\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nEngineers are familiar with the fact that when they raise the level of\r\na railway by heaping stone or gravel on a foundation of marsh,\r\nquicksand, or other yielding formation, the new mound often sinks for a\r\ntime as fast as they attempt to elevate it; when they have persevered\r\nso as to overcome this difficulty, they frequently find that some of\r\nthe adjoining flexible ground has risen up in one or more parallel\r\narches or folds, showing that the vertical pressure of the sinking\r\nmaterials has given rise to a lateral folding movement.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, in the interior of the earth, the solid parts of the\r\nearth’s crust may sometimes, as before mentioned, be made to expand by\r\nheat, or may be pressed by the force of steam against flexible strata\r\nloaded with a great weight of incumbent rocks. In this case the\r\nyielding mass, squeezed, but unable to overcome the resistance which it\r\nmeets with in a vertical direction, may be gradually relieved by\r\nlateral folding.\r\n\r\nFig. 60\r\nDip and Strike.—In describing the manner in which strata depart from\r\ntheir original horizontality, some technical terms, such as “dip” and\r\n“strike,” “anticlinal” and “synclinal” line or axis, are used by\r\ngeologists. I shall now proceed to explain some of these to the\r\nstudent. If a stratum or bed of rock, instead of being quite level, be\r\ninclined to one side, it is said to _dip_; the point of the compass to\r\nwhich it is inclined is called the _point of dip_, and the degree of\r\ndeviation from a level or horizontal line is called _ the amount of\r\ndip_, or _the angle of dip._ Thus, in the annexed diagram (Fig. 60), a\r\nseries of strata are inclined, and they dip to the north at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees. The _strike_, or _line of bearing_, is the\r\nprolongation or extension of the strata in a direction _at right\r\nangles_ to the dip; and hence it is sometimes called the _ direction_\r\nof the strata. Thus, in the above instance of strata dipping to the\r\nnorth, their strike must necessarily be east and west. We have borrowed\r\nthe word from the German geologists, _ streichen_ signifying to extend,\r\nto have a certain direction. Dip and strike may be aptly illustrated by\r\na row of houses running east and west, the long ridge of the roof\r\nrepresenting the strike of the stratum of slates, which dip on one side\r\nto the north, and on the other to the south.\r\n\r\nA stratum which is horizontal, or quite level in all directions, has\r\nneither dip nor strike.\r\n\r\nIt is always important for the geologist, who is endeavouring to\r\ncomprehend the structure of a country, to learn how the beds dip in\r\nevery part of the district; but it requires some practice to avoid\r\nbeing occasionally deceived, both as to the point of dip and the amount\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nFig. 61: Apparent horizontality of inclined strata.\r\n\r\nIf the upper surface of a hard stony stratum be uncovered, whether\r\nartificially in a quarry, or by waves at the foot of a cliff, it is\r\neasy to determine towards what point of the compass the slope is\r\nsteepest, or in what direction water would flow if poured upon it. This\r\nis the true dip. But the edges of highly inclined strata may give rise\r\nto perfectly horizontal lines in the face of a vertical cliff, if the\r\nobserver see the strata in the line of the strike, the dip being inward\r\nfrom the face of the cliff. If, however, we come to a break in the\r\ncliff, which exhibits a section exactly at right angles to the line of\r\nthe strike, we are then able to ascertain the true dip. In the drawing\r\n(Fig. 61), we may suppose a headland, one side of which faces to the\r\nnorth, where the beds would appear perfectly horizontal to a person in\r\nthe boat; while in the other side facing the west, the true dip would\r\nbe seen by the person on shore to be at an angle of 40°. If, therefore,\r\nour observations are confined to a vertical precipice facing in one\r\ndirection, we must endeavour to find a ledge or portion of the plane of\r\none of the beds projecting beyond the others, in order to ascertain the\r\ntrue dip.\r\n\r\nFig. 62: Two hands used to determine the inclination of strata.\r\nIf not provided with a clinometer, a most useful instrument, when it is\r\nof consequence to determine with precision the inclination of the\r\nstrata, the observer may measure the angle within a few degrees by\r\nstanding exactly opposite to a cliff where the true dip is exhibited,\r\nholding the hands immediately before the eyes, and placing the fingers\r\nof one in a perpendicular, and of the other in a horizontal position,\r\nas in Fig. 62. It is thus easy to discover whether the lines of the\r\ninclined beds bisect the angle of 90°, formed by the meeting of the\r\nhands, so as to give an angle of 45°, or whether it would divide the\r\nspace into two equal or unequal portions. You have only to change hands\r\nto get the line of dip on the upper side of the horizontal hand.\r\n\r\nFig. 63: Section illustrating the structure of the Swiss Jura.\r\n\r\nIt has been already seen, in describing the curved strata on the east\r\ncoast of Scotland, in Forfarshire and Berwickshire, that a series of\r\nconcave and convex bendings are occasionally repeated several times.\r\nThese usually form part of a series of parallel waves of strata, which\r\nare prolonged in the same direction, throughout a considerable extent\r\nof country. Thus, for example, in the Swiss Jura, that lofty chain of\r\nmountains has been proved to consist of many parallel ridges, with\r\nintervening longitudinal valleys, as in Fig. 63, the ridges being\r\nformed by curved fossiliferous strata, of which the nature and dip are\r\noccasionally displayed in deep transverse gorges, called “cluses,”\r\ncaused by fractures at right angles to the direction of the chain.[4]\r\nNow let us suppose these ridges and parallel valleys to run north and\r\nsouth, we should then say that the _strike_ of the beds is north and\r\nsouth, and the _dip_ east and west. Lines drawn along the summits of\r\nthe ridges, A, B, would be anticlinal lines, and one following the\r\nbottom of the adjoining valleys a synclinal line.\r\n\r\nFig. 64: Ground-plan of the denuded ridge C, Fig. 63. Fig. 65:\r\nTransverse section.\r\n\r\nOutcrop of Strata.—It will be observed that some of these ridges, A, B,\r\nare unbroken on the summit, whereas one of them, C, has been fractured\r\nalong the line of strike, and a portion of it carried away by\r\ndenudation, so that the ridges of the beds in the formations _a, b, c_\r\ncome out to the day, or, as the miners say, _crop out_, on the sides of\r\na valley. The ground-plan of such a denuded ridge as C, as given in a\r\ngeological map, may be expressed by the diagram, Fig. 64, and the\r\ncross-section of the same by Fig. 65. The line D E, Fig. 64, is the\r\nanticlinal line, on each side of which the dip is in opposite\r\ndirections, as expressed by the arrows. The emergence of strata at the\r\nsurface is called by miners their _outcrop_, or _basset._\r\n\r\nIf, instead of being folded into parallel ridges, the beds form a boss\r\nor dome-shaped protuberance, and if we suppose the summit of the dome\r\ncarried off, the ground-plan would exhibit the edges of the strata\r\nforming a succession of circles, or ellipses, round a common centre.\r\nThese circles are the lines of strike, and the dip being always at\r\nright angles is inclined in the course of the circuit to every point of\r\nthe compass, constituting what is termed a quâ-quâversal dip—that is,\r\nturning every way.\r\n\r\nThere are endless variations in the figures described by the\r\nbasset-edges of the strata, according to the different inclination of\r\nthe beds, and the mode in which they happen to have been denuded. One\r\nof the simplest rules, with which every geologist should be acquainted,\r\nrelates to the V-like form of the beds as they crop out in an ordinary\r\nvalley. First, if the strata be horizontal, the V-like form will be\r\nalso on a level, and the newest strata will appear at the greatest\r\nheights.\r\n\r\nFig. 66: Slope of valley 40°, dip of strata 20°. Fig. 67: Slope of\r\nvalley 20°, dip of strata 50°. Fig. 68: Slope of valley 20°, dip of\r\nstrata 20°, in opposite directions.\r\nSecondly, if the beds be inclined and intersected by a valley sloping\r\nin the same direction, and the dip of the beds be less steep than the\r\nslope of the valley, then the V’s, as they are often termed by miners,\r\nwill point upward (see Fig. 66), those formed by the newer beds\r\nappearing in a superior position, and extending highest up the valley,\r\nas A is seen above B.\r\n\r\nThirdly, if the dip of the beds be steeper than the slope of the\r\nvalley, then the V’s will point downward (see Fig. 67), and those\r\nformed of the older beds will now appear uppermost, as B appears above\r\nA.\r\n\r\nFourthly, in every case where the strata dip in a contrary direction to\r\nthe slope of the valley, whatever be the angle of inclination, the\r\nnewer beds will appear the highest, as in the first and second cases.\r\nThis is shown by the drawing (Fig. 68), which exhibits strata rising at\r\nan angle of 20°, and crossed by a valley, which declines in an opposite\r\ndirection at 20°.\r\n\r\nThese rules may often be of great practical utility; for the different\r\ndegrees of dip occurring in the two cases represented in Figs. 66 and\r\n67 may occasionally be encountered in following the same line of\r\nflexure at points a few miles distant from each other. A miner\r\nunacquainted with the rule, who had first explored the valley Fig. 66,\r\nmay have sunk a vertical shaft below the coal-seam A, until he reached\r\nthe inferior bed, B. He might then pass to the valley, Fig. 67, and\r\ndiscovering there also the outcrop of two coal-seams, might begin his\r\nworkings in the uppermost in the expectation of coming down to the\r\nother bed A, which would be observed cropping out lower down the\r\nvalley. But a glance at the section will demonstrate the futility of\r\nsuch hopes.[5]\r\n\r\nSection of carboniferous rocks of Lancashire. Section of carboniferous\r\nrocks of Lancashire. (E. Hull.[6])\r\n\r\nSynclinal Strata forming Ridges.—Although in many cases an anticlinal\r\naxis forms a ridge, and a synclinal axis a valley, as in A B, Fig. 63,\r\nyet this can by no means be laid down as a general rule, as the beds\r\nvery often slope inward from either side of a mountain, as at _a, b,_\r\nFig. 69, while in the intervening valley, _c_, they slope upward,\r\nforming an arch.\r\n\r\nIt would be natural to expect the fracture of solid rocks to take place\r\nchiefly where the bending of the strata has been sharpest, and such\r\nrending may produce ravines giving access to running water and exposing\r\nthe surface to atmospheric waste. The entire absence, however, of such\r\ncracks at points where the strain must have been greatest, as at _a_,\r\nFig. 63, is often very remarkable, and not always easy of explanation.\r\nWe must imagine that many strata of limestone, chert, and other rocks\r\nwhich are now brittle, were pliant when bent into their present\r\nposition. They may have owed their flexibility in part to the fluid\r\nmatter which they contained in their minute pores, as before described\r\np. 62 and in part to the permeation of sea-water while they were yet\r\nsubmerged.\r\n\r\nFig. 70: Strata of chert, grit, and marl, near St. Jean de Luz.\r\n\r\nAt the western extremity of the Pyrenees, great curvatures of the\r\nstrata are seen in the sea-cliffs, where the rocks consist of marl,\r\ngrit, and chert. At certain points, as at _a_, Fig. 70, some of the\r\nbendings of the flinty chert are so sharp that specimens might be\r\nbroken off well fitted to serve as ridge-tiles on the roof of a house.\r\nAlthough this chert could not have been brittle as now, when first\r\nfolded into this shape, it presents, nevertheless, here and there, at\r\nthe points of greatest flexure, small cracks, which show that it was\r\nsolid, and not wholly incapable of breaking at the period of its\r\ndisplacement. The numerous rents alluded to are not empty, but filled\r\nwith chalcedony and quartz.\r\n\r\nFig. 71: Bent and undulating gypseous marl.\r\nBetween San Caterina and Castrogiovanni, in Sicily, bent and undulating\r\ngypseous marls occur, with here and there thin beds of solid gypsum\r\ninterstratified. Sometimes these solid layers have been broken into\r\ndetached fragments, still preserving their sharp edges (_g, g,_ Fig.\r\n71), while the continuity of the more pliable and ductile marls, _m,\r\nm,_ has not been interrupted.\r\n\r\nFig. 72: Folded strata.\r\nWe have already explained, Fig. 69, that stratified rocks have usually\r\ntheir strata bent into parallel folds forming anticlinal and synclinal\r\naxes, a group of several of these folds having often been subjected to\r\na common movement, and having acquired a uniform strike or direction.\r\nIn some disturbed regions these folds have been doubled back upon\r\nthemselves in such a manner that it is often difficult for an\r\nexperienced geologist to determine correctly the relative age of the\r\nbeds by superposition. Thus, if we meet with the strata seen in the\r\nsection, Fig. 72, we should naturally suppose that there were twelve\r\ndistinct beds, or sets of beds, No. 1 being the newest, and No. 12 the\r\noldest of the series. But this section may perhaps exhibit merely six\r\nbeds, which have been folded in the manner seen in Fig. 73, so that\r\neach of them is twice repeated, the position of one half being\r\nreversed, and part of No. 1, originally the uppermost, having now\r\nbecome the lowest of the series.\r\n\r\nFig. 73\r\nThese phenomena are observable on a magnificent scale in certain\r\nregions in Switzerland, in precipices often more than 2000 feet in\r\nperpendicular height, and there are flexures not inferior in dimensions\r\nin the Pyrenees. The upper part of the curves seen in this diagram,\r\nFig. 73, and expressed in fainter lines, has been removed by what is\r\ncalled denudation, to be afterwards explained.\r\n\r\nFractures of the Strata and Faults.—Numerous rents may often be seen in\r\nrocks which appear to have been simply broken, the fractured parts\r\nstill remaining in contact; but we often find a fissure, several inches\r\nor yards wide, intervening between the disunited portions. These\r\nfissures are usually filled with fine earth and sand, or with angular\r\nfragments of stone, evidently derived from the fracture of the\r\ncontiguous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe face of each wall of the fissure is often beautifully polished, as\r\nif glazed, striated, or scored with parallel furrows and ridges, such\r\nas would be produced by the continued rubbing together of surfaces of\r\nunequal hardness. These polished surfaces are called by miners\r\n“slickensides.” It is supposed that the lines of the striæ indicate the\r\ndirection in which the rocks were moved. During one of the minor\r\nearthquakes in Chili, in 1840, the brick walls of a building were rent\r\nvertically in several places, and made to vibrate for several minutes\r\nduring each shock, after which they remained uninjured, and without any\r\nopening, although the line of each crack was still visible. When all\r\nmovement had ceased, there were seen on the floor of the house, at the\r\nbottom of each rent, small heaps of fine brick-dust, evidently produced\r\nby trituration.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find the mass of rock on one side of a fissure\r\nthrown up above or down below the mass with which it was once in\r\ncontact on the other side. “This mode of displacement is called a\r\nfault, shift, slip, or throw.” “The miner,” says Playfair, describing a\r\nfault, “is often perplexed, in his subterranean journey, by a\r\nderangement in the strata, which changes at once all those lines and\r\nbearings which had hitherto directed his course. When his mine reaches\r\na certain plane, which is sometimes perpendicular, as in A B, Fig. 74,\r\nsometimes oblique to the horizon (as in C D, ibid.), he finds the beds\r\nof rock broken asunder, those on the one side of the plane having\r\nchanged their place, by sliding in a particular direction along the\r\nface of the others. In this motion they have sometimes preserved their\r\nparallelism, as in Fig. 74, so that the strata on each side of faults A\r\nB, C D, continue parallel to one another; in other cases, the strata on\r\neach side are inclined, as in _a, b, c, d_ (Fig. 75), though their\r\nidentity is still to be recognised by their possessing the same\r\nthickness and the same internal characters.”[7]\r\n\r\nFig. 74: Faults.\r\n\r\nFig. 75: E F, fault or fissure filled with rubbish, on each side of\r\nwhich the shifted strata are not parallel.\r\n\r\nIn Coalbrook Dale, says Mr. Prestwich[8], deposits of sandstone, shale,\r\nand coal, several thousand feet thick, and occupying an area of many\r\nmiles, have been shivered into fragments, and the broken remnants have\r\nbeen placed in very discordant positions, often at levels differing\r\nseveral hundred feet from each other. The sides of the faults, when\r\nperpendicular, are commonly several yards apart, and are sometimes as\r\nmuch as 50 yards asunder, the interval being filled with broken\r\n_débris_ of the strata. In following the course of the same fault it is\r\nsometimes found to produce in different places very unequal changes of\r\nlevel, the amount of shift being in one place 300, and in another 700\r\nfeet, which arises from the union of two or more faults. In other\r\nwords, the disjointed strata have in certain districts been subjected\r\nto renewed movements, which they have not suffered elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe may occasionally see exact counterparts of these slips, on a small\r\nscale, in pits of loose sand and gravel, many of which have doubtless\r\nbeen caused by the drying and shrinking of argillaceous and other beds,\r\nslight subsidences having taken place from failure of support.\r\nSometimes, however, even these small slips may have been produced\r\nduring earthquakes; for land has been moved, and its level, relatively\r\nto the sea, considerably altered, within the period when much of the\r\nalluvial sand and gravel now covering the surface of continents was\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that a geologist must be on his guard, in a\r\nregion of disturbed strata, against inferring repeated alternations of\r\nrocks, when, in fact, the same strata, once continuous, have been bent\r\nround so as to recur in the same section, and with the same dip. A\r\nsimilar mistake has often been occasioned by a series of faults.\r\n\r\nFig. 76: Apparent alternations of strata caused by vertical faults.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, the dark line A H (Fig. 76) represent the surface of a\r\ncountry on which the strata _a, b, c_ frequently crop out, an observer\r\nwho is proceeding from H to A might at first imagine that at every step\r\nhe was approaching new strata, whereas the repetition of the same beds\r\nhas been caused by vertical faults, or downthrows. Thus, suppose the\r\noriginal mass, A, B, C, D, to have been a set of uniformly inclined\r\nstrata, and that the different masses under E F, F G, and G D sank down\r\nsuccessively, so as to leave vacant the spaces marked in the diagram by\r\ndotted lines, and to occupy those marked by the continuous lines, then\r\nlet denudation take place along the line A H, so that the protruding\r\nmasses indicated by the fainter lines are swept away—a miner, who has\r\nnot discovered the faults, finding the mass _a_, which we will suppose\r\nto be a bed of coal four times repeated, might hope to find four beds,\r\nworkable to an indefinite depth, but first, on arriving at the fault G,\r\nhe is stopped suddenly in his workings, for he comes partly upon the\r\nshale _b_, and partly on the sandstone _ c_; the same result awaits him\r\nat the fault F, and on reaching E he is again stopped by a wall\r\ncomposed of the rock _d._\r\n\r\nThe very different levels at which the separated parts of the same\r\nstrata are found on the different sides of the fissure, in some faults,\r\nis truly astonishing. One of the most celebrated in England is that\r\ncalled the “ninety-fathom dike,” in the coal-field of Newcastle. This\r\nname has been given to it, because the same beds are ninety fathoms\r\n(540 feet) lower on the northern than they are on the southern side.\r\nThe fissure has been filled by a body of sand, which is now in the\r\nstate of sandstone, and is called the dike, which is sometimes very\r\nnarrow, but in other places more than twenty yards wide.[9] The walls\r\nof the fissure are scored by grooves, such as would have been produced\r\nif the broken ends of the rock had been rubbed along the plane of the\r\nfault.[10] In the Tynedale and Craven faults, in the north of England,\r\nthe vertical displacement is still greater, and the fracture has\r\nextended in a horizontal direction for a distance of thirty miles or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nGreat Faults the Result of Repeated Movements.—It must not, however, be\r\nsupposed that faults generally consist of single linear rents; there\r\nare usually a number of faults springing off from the main one, and\r\nsometimes a long strip of country seems broken up into fragments by\r\nsets of parallel and connecting transverse faults. Oftentimes a great\r\nline of fault has been repeated, or the movements have been continued\r\nthrough successive periods, so that, newer deposits having covered the\r\nold line of displacement, the strata both newer and older have given\r\nway along the old line of fracture. Some geologists have considered it\r\nnecessary to imagine that the upward or downward movement in these\r\ncases was accomplished at a single stroke, and not by a series of\r\nsudden but interrupted movements. They appear to have derived this idea\r\nfrom a notion that the grooved walls have merely been rubbed in one\r\ndirection, which is far from being a constant phenomenon. Not only are\r\nsome sets of striæ not parallel to others, but the clay and rubbish\r\nbetween the walls, when squeezed or rubbed, have been streaked in\r\ndifferent directions, the grooves which the harder minerals have\r\nimpressed on the softer being frequently curved and irregular.\r\n\r\nFig. 77: Faults and denuded coal-strata, Ashby de la Zouch.\r\n\r\nThe usual absence of protruding masses of rock forming precipices or\r\nridges along the lines of great faults has already been alluded to in\r\nexplaining Fig. 76, p. 89, and the same remarkable fact is well\r\nexemplified in every coal-field which has been extensively worked. It\r\nis in such districts that the former relation of the beds which have\r\nbeen shifted is determinable with great accuracy. Thus in the\r\ncoal-field of Ashby de la Zouch, in Leicestershire (see Fig. 77), a\r\nfault occurs, on one side of which the coal-beds _a, b, c, d_ must once\r\nhave risen to the height of 500 feet above the corresponding beds on\r\nthe other side. But the uplifted strata do not stand up 500 feet above\r\nthe general surface; on the contrary, the outline of the country, as\r\nexpressed by the line _z z_, is uniformly undulating, without any\r\nbreak, and the mass indicated by the dotted outline must have been\r\nwashed away.[11]\r\n\r\nThe student may refer to Mr. Hull’s measurement of faults, observed in\r\nthe Lancashire coal-field, where the vertical displacement has amounted\r\nto thousands of feet, and yet where all the superficial inequalities\r\nwhich must have resulted from such movements have been obliterated by\r\nsubsequent denudation. In the same memoir proofs are afforded of there\r\nhaving been two periods of vertical movement in the same fault—one, for\r\nexample, before, and another after, the Triassic epoch.[12]\r\n\r\nThe shifting of the beds by faults is often intimately connected with\r\nthose same foldings which constitute the anticlinal and synclinal axes\r\nbefore alluded to, and there is no doubt that the subterranean causes\r\nof both forms of disturbance are to a great extent the same. A fault in\r\nVirginia, believed to imply a displacement of several thousand feet,\r\nhas been traced for more than eighty miles in the same direction as the\r\nfoldings of the Appalachian chain.[13] An hypothesis which attributes\r\nsuch a change of position to a succession of movements, is far\r\npreferable to any theory which assumes each fault to have been\r\naccomplished by a single upcast or downthrow of several thousand feet.\r\nFor we know that there are operations now in progress, at great depths\r\nin the interior of the earth, by which both large and small tracts of\r\nground are made to rise above and sink below their former level, some\r\nslowly and insensibly, others suddenly and by starts, a few feet or\r\nyards at a time; whereas there are no grounds for believing that,\r\nduring the last 3000 years at least, any regions have been either\r\nupheaved or depressed, at a single stroke, to the amount of several\r\nhundred, much less several thousand feet.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not easy to understand how in the subterranean regions\r\none mass of solid rock should have been folded up by a continued series\r\nof movements, while another mass in contact, or only separated by a\r\nline of fissure, has remained stationary or has perhaps subsided. But\r\nevery volcano, by the intermittent action of the steam, gases, and lava\r\nevolved during an eruption, helps us to form some idea of the manner in\r\nwhich such operations take place. For eruptions are repeated at\r\nuncertain intervals throughout the whole or a large part of a\r\ngeological period, some of the surrounding and contiguous districts\r\nremaining quite undisturbed. And in most of the instances with which we\r\nare best acquainted the emission of lava, scoria, and steam is\r\naccompanied by the uplifting of the solid crust. Thus in Vesuvius,\r\nEtna, the Madeiras, the Canary Islands, and the Azores there is\r\nevidence of marine deposits of recent and tertiary date having been\r\nelevated to the height of a thousand feet, and sometimes more, since\r\nthe commencement of the volcanic explosions. There is, moreover, a\r\ngeneral tendency in contemporaneous volcanic vents to affect a linear\r\narrangement, extending in some instances, as in the Andes or the Indian\r\nArchipelago, to distances equalling half the circumference of the\r\nglobe. Where volcanic heat, therefore, operates at such a depth as not\r\nto obtain vent at the surface, in the form of an eruption, it may\r\nnevertheless be conceived to give rise to upheavals, foldings, and\r\nfaults in certain linear tracts. And marine denudation, to be treated\r\nof in the next chapter, will help us to understand why that which\r\nshould be the protruding portion of the faulted rocks is missing at the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nArrangement and Direction of Parallel Folds of Strata.—The possible\r\ncauses of the folding of strata by lateral movements have been\r\nconsidered in a former part of this chapter. No European chain of\r\nmountains affords so remarkable an illustration of the persistency of\r\nsuch flexures for a great distance as the Appalachians before alluded\r\nto, and none has been studied and described by many good observers with\r\nmore accuracy. The chain extends from north to south, or rather N.N.E.\r\nto S.S.W., for nearly 1500 miles, with a breadth of 50 miles,\r\nthroughout which the Palæozoic strata have been so bent as to form a\r\nseries of parallel anticlinal and synclinal ridges and troughs,\r\ncomprising usually three or four principal and many smaller plications,\r\nsome of them forming broad and gentle arches, others narrower and\r\nsteeper ones, while some, where the bending has been greatest, have the\r\nposition of their beds inverted, as before shown in Fig. 73, p. 87.\r\n\r\nThe strike of the parallel ridges, after continuing in a straight line\r\nfor many hundred miles, is then found to vary for a more limited\r\ndistance as much as 30°, the folds wheeling round together in the new\r\ndirection and continuing to be parallel, as if they had all obeyed the\r\nsame movement. The date of the movements by which the great flexures\r\nwere brought about must, of course, be subsequent to the formation of\r\nthe uppermost part of the coal or the newest of the bent rocks, but the\r\ndisturbance must have ceased before the Triassic strata were deposited\r\non the denuded edges of the folded beds.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the numerous parallel folds, all simultaneously\r\nformed, assume a new direction common to the whole of them, and\r\nsometimes varying at an angle of 30° from the normal strike of the\r\nchain, shows what deviation from an otherwise uniform strike of the\r\nbeds may be experienced when the geographical area through which they\r\nare traced is on so vast a scale.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances in the case here adverted to occurred between the\r\nCarboniferous period and that of the Trias, and this interval is so\r\nvast that they may have occupied a great lapse of time, during which\r\ntheir parallelism was always preserved. But, as a rule, wherever after\r\na long geological interval the recurrence of lateral movements gives\r\nrise to a new set of folds, the strike of these last is different.\r\nThus, for example, Mr. Hull has pointed out that three principal lines\r\nof disturbance, all later than the Carboniferous period, have affected\r\nthe stratified rocks of Lancashire. The first of these, having an\r\nE.N.E. direction, took place at the close of the Carboniferous period.\r\nThe next, running north and south, at the close of the Permian, and the\r\nthird, having a N.N.W. direction, at the close of the Jurassic\r\nperiod.[14]\r\n\r\nFig. 78: Unconformable junction of old red sandstone and Silurian\r\nschist at the Siccar Point, near St. Abb’s Head, Berwickshire.\r\n\r\nUnconformability of Strata.— Strata are said to be unconformable when\r\none series is so placed over another that the planes of the superior\r\nrepose on the edges of the inferior (see Fig. 78). In this case it is\r\nevident that a period had elapsed between the production of the two\r\nsets of strata, and that, during this interval, the older series had\r\nbeen tilted and disturbed. Afterwards the upper series was thrown down\r\nin horizontal strata upon it. If these superior beds, _d, d,_ Fig. 78,\r\nare also inclined, it is plain that the lower strata _a, a,_ have been\r\ntwice displaced; first, before the deposition of the newer beds, _d,\r\nd,_ and a second time when these same strata were upraised out of the\r\nsea, and thrown slightly out of the horizontal position.\r\n\r\nFig. 79: Junction of unconformable strata near Mons, in Belgium.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that in the interval between the deposition of two\r\nsets of unconformable strata, the inferior rock has not only been\r\ndenuded, but drilled by perforating shells. Thus, for example, at\r\nAutreppe and Gusigny, near Mons, beds of an ancient (primary or\r\npalæozoic) limestone, highly inclined, and often bent, are covered with\r\nhorizontal strata of greenish and whitish marls of the Cretaceous\r\nformation. The lowest, and therefore the oldest, bed of the horizontal\r\nseries is usually the sand and conglomerate, _a_, in which are rounded\r\nfragments of stone, from an inch to two feet in diameter. These\r\nfragments have often adhering shells attached to them, and have been\r\nbored by perforating mollusca. The solid surface of the inferior\r\nlimestone has also been bored, so as to exhibit cylindrical and\r\npear-shaped cavities, as at _c_, the work of saxicavous mollusca; and\r\nmany rents, as at _b_, which descend several feet or yards into the\r\nlimestone, have been filled with sand and shells, similar to those in\r\nthe stratum _a._\r\n\r\nOverlapping Strata.—Strata are said to overlap when an upper bed\r\nextends beyond the limits of a lower one. This may be produced in\r\nvarious ways; as, for example, when alterations of physical geography\r\ncause the arms of a river or channels of discharge to vary, so that\r\nsediment brought down is deposited over a wider area than before, or\r\nwhen the sea-bottom has been raised up and again depressed without\r\ndisturbing the horizontal position of the strata. In this case the\r\nnewer strata may rest for the most part conformably on the older, but,\r\nextending farther, pass over their edges. Every intermediate state\r\nbetween unconformable and over-lapping beds may occur, because there\r\nmay be every gradation between a slight derangement of position, and a\r\nconsiderable disturbance and denudation of the older formation before\r\nthe newer beds come on.\r\n\r\n [1] See “Principles of Geology,” 1867, p. 314.\r\n\r\n [2] Edin.

This operation has exerted an\r\ninfluence on the structure of the earth’s crust as universal and\r\nimportant as sedimentary deposition itself; for denudation is the\r\nnecessary antecedent of the production of all new strata of mechanical\r\norigin. The formation of every new deposit by the transport of sediment\r\nand pebbles necessarily implies that there has been, somewhere else, a\r\ngrinding down of rock into rounded fragments, sand, or mud, equal in\r\nquantity to the new strata. All deposition, therefore, except in the\r\ncase of a shower of volcanic ashes, and the outflow of lava, and the\r\ngrowth of certain organic formations, is the sign of superficial waste\r\ngoing on contemporaneously, and to an equal amount, elsewhere. The gain\r\nat one point is no more than sufficient to balance the loss at some\r\nother. Here a lake has grown shallower, there a ravine has been\r\ndeepened. Here the depth of the sea has been augmented by the removal\r\nof a sandbank during a storm, there its bottom has been raised and\r\nshallowed by the accumulation in its bed of the same sand transported\r\nfrom the bank.\r\n\r\nWhen we see a stone building, we know that somewhere, far or near, a\r\nquarry has been opened. The courses of stone in the building may be\r\ncompared to successive strata, the quarry to a ravine or valley which\r\nhas suffered denudation. As the strata, like the courses of hewn stone,\r\nhave been laid one upon another gradually, so the excavation both of\r\nthe valley and quarry have been gradual. To pursue the comparison still\r\nfarther, the superficial heaps of mud, sand, and gravel, usually called\r\nalluvium, may be likened to the rubbish of a quarry which has been\r\nrejected as useless by the workmen, or has fallen upon the road between\r\nthe quarry and the building, so as to lie scattered at random over the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nBut we occasionally find in a conglomerate large rounded pebbles of an\r\nolder conglomerate, which had previously been derived from a variety of\r\ndifferent rocks. In such cases we are reminded that, the same materials\r\nhaving been used over and over again, it is not enough to affirm that\r\nthe entire mass of stratified deposits in the earth’s crust affords a\r\nmonument and measure of the denudation which has taken place, for in\r\ntruth the quantity of matter now extant in the form of stratified rock\r\nrepresents but a fraction of the material removed by water and\r\nredeposited in past ages.\r\n\r\nSubaërial Denudation.—Denudation may be divided into subaërial, or the\r\naction of wind, rain, and rivers; and submarine, or that effected by\r\nthe waves of the sea, and its tides and currents. With the operation of\r\nthe first of these we are best acquainted, and it may be well to give\r\nit our first attention.\r\n\r\n_Action of the Wind._—In desert regions where no rain falls, or where,\r\nas in parts of the Sahara, the soil is so salt as to be without any\r\ncovering of vegetation, clouds of dust and sand attest the power of the\r\nwind to cause the shifting of the unconsolidated or disintegrated rock.\r\n\r\nIn examining volcanic countries I have been much struck with the great\r\nsuperficial changes brought about by this power in the course of\r\ncenturies. The highest peak of Madeira is about 6050 feet above the\r\nsea, and consists of the skeleton of a volcanic cone now 250 feet high,\r\nthe beds of which once dipped from a centre in all directions at an\r\nangle of more than 30°. The summit is formed of a dike of basalt with\r\nmuch olivine, fifteen feet wide, apparently the remains of a column of\r\nlava which once rose to the crater. Nearly all the scoriæ of the upper\r\npart of the cone have been swept away, those portions only remaining\r\nwhich were hardened by the contact or proximity of the dike. While I\r\nwas myself on this peak on January 25, 1854, I saw the wind, though it\r\nwas not stormy weather, removing sand and dust derived from the\r\ndecomposing scoriæ. There had been frost in the night, and some ice was\r\nstill seen in the crevices of the rock.\r\n\r\nOn the highest platform of the Grand Canary, at an elevation of 6000\r\nfeet, there is a cylindrical column of hard lava, from which the softer\r\nmatter has been carried away; and other similar remnants of the dikes\r\nof cones of eruption attest the denuding power of the wind at points\r\nwhere running water could never have exerted any influence. The waste\r\neffected by wind aided by frost and snow, may not be trifling, even in\r\na single winter, and when multiplied by centuries may become\r\nindefinitely great.\r\n\r\nFig. 80: Section through several eroded formations.\r\n\r\n_Action of Running Water._—There are different classes of phenomena\r\nwhich attest in a most striking manner the vast spaces left vacant by\r\nthe erosive power of water. I may allude, first, to those valleys on\r\nboth sides of which the same strata are seen following each other in\r\nthe same order, and having the same mineral composition and fossil\r\ncontents. We may observe, for example, several formations, as Nos. 1,\r\n2, 3, 4, in the diagram (Fig. 80): No. 1, conglomerate, No. 2, clay,\r\nNo. 3, grit, and No. 4, limestone, each repeated in a series of hills\r\nseparated by valleys varying in depth. When we examine the subordinate\r\nparts of these four formations, we find, in like manner, distinct beds\r\nin each, corresponding, on the opposite sides of the valleys, both in\r\ncomposition and order of position. No one can doubt that the strata\r\nwere originally continuous, and that some cause has swept away the\r\nportions which once connected the whole series. A torrent on the side\r\nof a mountain produces similar interruptions; and when we make\r\nartificial cuts in lowering roads, we expose, in like manner,\r\ncorresponding beds on either side. But in nature, these appearances\r\noccur in mountains several thousand feet high, and separated by\r\nintervals of many miles or leagues in extent.\r\n\r\nIn the “Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain” (vol. i),\r\nProfessor Ramsay has shown that the missing beds, removed from the\r\nsummit of the Mendips, must have been nearly a mile in thickness; and\r\nhe has pointed out considerable areas in South Wales and some of the\r\nadjacent counties of England, where a series of primary (or palæozoic)\r\nstrata, no less than 11,000 feet in thickness, have been stripped off.\r\nAll these materials have of course been transported to new regions, and\r\nhave entered into the composition of more modern formations. On the\r\nother hand, it is shown by observations in the same “Survey,” that the\r\nPalæozoic strata are from 20,000 to 30,000 feet thick. It is clear that\r\nsuch rocks, formed of mud and sand, now for the most part consolidated,\r\nare the monuments of denuding operations, which took place on a grand\r\nscale at a very remote period in the earth’s history. For, whatever has\r\nbeen given to one area must always have been borrowed from another; a\r\ntruth which, obvious as it may seem when thus stated, must be\r\nrepeatedly impressed on the student’s mind, because in many geological\r\nspeculations it is taken for granted that the external crust of the\r\nearth has been always growing thicker in consequence of the\r\naccumulation, period after period, of sedimentary matter, as if the new\r\nstrata were not always produced at the expense of pre-existing rocks,\r\nstratified or unstratified. By duly reflecting on the fact that all\r\ndeposits of mechanical origin imply the transportation from some other\r\nregion, whether contiguous or remote, of an equal amount of solid\r\nmatter, we perceive that the stony exterior of the planet must always\r\nhave grown thinner in one place, whenever, by accessions of new strata,\r\nit was acquiring thickness in another.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that generally at the mouths of large rivers, deltas\r\nare forming and the land is encroaching upon the sea; these deltas are\r\nmonuments of recent denudation and deposition; and it is obvious that\r\nif the mud, sand, and gravel were taken from them and restored to the\r\ncontinents they would fill up a large part of the gullies and valleys\r\nwhich are due to the excavating and transporting power of torrents and\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nAlluvium.—Between the superficial covering of vegetable mould and the\r\nsubjacent rock there usually intervenes in every district a deposit of\r\nloose gravel, sand, and mud, to which when it occurs in valleys the\r\nname of alluvium has been popularly applied. The term is derived from\r\n_alluvio_, an inundation, or _alluo_, to wash, because the pebbles and\r\nsand commonly resemble those of a river’s bed or the mud and gravel\r\nwashed over low lands by a flood.\r\n\r\nIn the course of those changes in physical geography which may take\r\nplace during the gradual emergence of the bottom of the sea and its\r\nconversion into dry land, any spot may either have been a sunken reef,\r\nor a bay, or estuary, or sea-shore, or the bed of a river. The\r\ndrainage, moreover, may have been deranged again and again by\r\nearthquakes, during which temporary lakes are caused by landslips, and\r\npartial deluges occasioned by the bursting of the barriers of such\r\nlakes. For this reason it would be unreasonable to hope that we should\r\never be able to account for all the alluvial phenomena of each\r\nparticular country, seeing that the causes of their origin are so\r\nvarious. Besides, the last operations of water have a tendency to\r\ndisturb and confound together all pre-existing alluviums. Hence we are\r\nalways in danger of regarding as the work of a single era, and the\r\neffect of one cause, what has in reality been the result of a variety\r\nof distinct agents, during a long succession of geological epochs. Much\r\nuseful instruction may therefore be gained from the exploration of a\r\ncountry like Auvergne, where the superficial gravel of very different\r\neras happens to have been preserved and kept separate by sheets of\r\nlava, which were poured out one after the other at periods when the\r\ndenudation, and probably the upheaval, of rocks were in progress. That\r\nregion had already acquired in some degree its present configuration\r\nbefore any volcanoes were in activity, and before any igneous matter\r\nwas superimposed upon the granitic and fossiliferous formations. The\r\npebbles therefore in the older gravels are exclusively constituted of\r\ngranite and other aboriginal rocks; and afterwards, when volcanic vents\r\nburst forth into eruption, those earlier alluviums were covered by\r\nstreams of lava, which protected them from intermixture with gravel of\r\nsubsequent date. In the course of ages, a new system of valleys was\r\nexcavated, so that the rivers ran at lower levels than those at which\r\nthe first alluviums and sheets of lava were formed. When, therefore,\r\nfresh eruptions gave rise to new lava, the melted matter was poured out\r\nover lower grounds; and the gravel of these plains differed from the\r\nfirst or upland alluvium, by containing in it rounded fragments of\r\nvarious volcanic rocks, and often fossil bones belonging to species of\r\nland animals different from those which had previously flourished in\r\nthe same country and been buried in older gravels.\r\n\r\nFig. 81: Lavas of Auvergne resting on alluviums of different ages.\r\n\r\nThe annexed drawing (Fig. 81) will explain the different heights at\r\nwhich beds of lava and gravel, each distinct from the other in\r\ncomposition and age, are observed, some on the flat tops of hills, 700\r\nor 800 feet high, others on the slope of the same hills, and the newest\r\nof all in the channel of the existing river where there is usually\r\ngravel alone, although in some cases a narrow strip of solid lava\r\nshares the bottom of the valley with the river.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of extinct species of quadrupeds is more numerous in the\r\nfossil remains of the gravel No. 1 than in that indicated as No. 2; and\r\nin No. 3 they agree more closely, sometimes entirely, with those of the\r\nexisting fauna. The usual absence or rarity of organic remains in beds\r\nof loose gravel and sand is partly owing to the friction which\r\noriginally ground down the rocks into small fragments, and partly to\r\nthe porous nature of alluvium, which allows the free percolation\r\nthrough it of rain-water, and promotes the decomposition and removal of\r\nfossil remains.\r\n\r\nThe loose transported matter on the surface of a large part of the land\r\nnow existing in the temperate and arctic regions of the northern\r\nhemisphere, must be regarded as being in a somewhat exceptional state,\r\nin consequence of the important part which ice has played in\r\ncomparatively modern geological times. This subject will be more\r\nspecially alluded to when we describe, in the eleventh chapter, the\r\ndeposits called “glacial.”\r\n\r\nDenuding Power of Rivers affected by Rise or Fall of Land.—It has long\r\nbeen a matter of common observation that most rivers are now cutting\r\ntheir channels through alluvial deposits of greater depth and extent\r\nthan could ever have been formed by the present streams. From this fact\r\nit has been inferred that rivers in general have grown smaller, or\r\nbecome less liable to be flooded than formerly. It may be true that in\r\nthe history of almost every country the rivers have been both larger\r\nand smaller than they are at the present moment. For the rainfall in\r\nparticular regions varies according to climate and physical geography,\r\nand is especially governed by the elevation of the land above the sea,\r\nor its distance from it and other conditions equally fluctuating in the\r\ncourse of time. But the phenomenon alluded to may sometimes be\r\naccounted for by oscillations in the level of the land, experienced\r\nsince the existing valleys originated, even where no marked diminution\r\nin the quantity of rain and in the size of the rivers has occurred.\r\n\r\nWe know that many large areas of land are rising and others sinking,\r\nand unless it could be assumed that both the upward and downward\r\nmovements are everywhere uniform, many of the existing hydrographical\r\nbasins ought to have the appearance of having been temporary lakes\r\nfirst filled with fluviatile strata and then partially re-excavated.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, part of a continent, comprising within it a large\r\nhydrographical basin like that of the Mississippi, to subside several\r\ninches or feet in a century, as the west coast of Greenland, extending\r\n600 miles north and south, has been sinking for three or four\r\ncenturies, between the latitudes 60° and 69° N.[1] It will rarely\r\nhappen that the rate of subsidence will be everywhere equal, and in\r\nmany cases the amount of depression in the interior will regularly\r\nexceed that of the region nearer the sea. Whenever this happens, the\r\nfall of the waters flowing from the upland country will be diminished,\r\nand each tributary stream will have less power to carry its sand and\r\nsediment into the main river, and the main river less power to convey\r\nits annual burden of transported matter to the sea. All the rivers,\r\ntherefore, will proceed to fill up partially their ancient channels,\r\nand, during frequent inundations, will raise their alluvial plains by\r\nnew deposits. If then the same area of land be again upheaved to its\r\nformer height, the fall, and consequently the velocity, of every river\r\nwill begin to augment. Each of them will be less given to overflow its\r\nalluvial plain; and their power of carrying earthy matter seaward, and\r\nof scouring out and deepening their channels, will be sustained till,\r\nafter a lapse of many thousand years, each of them has eroded a new\r\nchannel or valley through a fluviatile formation of comparatively\r\nmodern date. The surface of what was once the river-plain at the period\r\nof greatest depression, will then remain fringing the valley-sides in\r\nthe form of a terrace apparently flat, but in reality sloping down with\r\nthe general inclination of the river. Everywhere this terrace will\r\npresent cliffs of gravel and sand, facing the river. That such a series\r\nof movements has actually taken place in the main valley of the\r\nMississippi and in its tributary valleys during oscillations of level,\r\nI have endeavoured to show in my description of that country;[2] and\r\nthe fresh-water shells of existing species and bones of land\r\nquadrupeds, partly of extinct races, preserved in the terraces of\r\nfluviatile origin, attest the exclusion of the sea during the whole\r\nprocess of filling up and partial re-excavation.\r\n\r\nLittoral Denudation.—Part of the action of the waves between high and\r\nlow watermark must be included in subaërial denudation, more especially\r\nas the undermining of cliffs by the waves is facilitated by\r\nland-springs, and these often lead to the sliding down of great masses\r\nof land into the sea. Along our coasts we find numerous submerged\r\nforests, only visible at low water, having the trunks of the trees\r\nerect and their roots attached to them and still spreading through the\r\nancient soil as when they were living. They occur in too many places,\r\nand sometimes at too great a depth, to be explained by a mere change in\r\nthe level of the tides, although as the coasts waste away and alter in\r\nshape, the height to which the tides rise and fall is always varying,\r\nand the level of high tide at any given point may, in the course of\r\nmany ages, differ by several feet or even fathoms. It is this\r\nfluctuation in the height of the tides, and the erosion and destruction\r\nof the sea-coast by the waves, that makes it exceedingly difficult for\r\nus in a few centuries, or even perhaps in a few thousand years, to\r\ndetermine whether there is a change by subterranean movement in the\r\nrelative level of sea and land.\r\n\r\nWe often behold, as on the coasts of Devonshire and Pembrokeshire,\r\nfacts which appear to lead to opposite conclusions. In one place a\r\nraised beach with marine littoral shells, and in another immediately\r\nadjoining a submerged forest. These phenomena indicate oscillations of\r\nlevel, and as the movements are very gradual, they must give repeated\r\nopportunities to the breakers to denude the land which is thus again\r\nand again exposed to their fury, although it is evident that the\r\nsubmergence is sometimes effected in such a manner as to allow the\r\ntrees which border the coast not to be carried away.\r\n\r\nInland Sea-cliffs.—In countries where hard limestone rocks abound,\r\ninland cliffs have often retained faithfully for ages the characters\r\nwhich they acquired when they constituted the boundary of land and sea.\r\nThus, in the Morea, no less than three or even four ranges of cliffs\r\nare well-preserved, rising one above the other at different distances\r\nfrom the actual shore, the summit of the highest and oldest\r\noccasionally attaining 1000 feet in elevation. A consolidated beach\r\nwith marine shells is usually found at the base of each cliff, and a\r\nline of littoral caverns. These ranges of cliff probably imply pauses\r\nin the process of upheaval when the waves and currents had time to\r\nundermine and clear away considerable masses of rock.\r\n\r\nBut the beginner should be warned not to expect to find evidence of the\r\nformer sojourn of the sea on all those lands which we are nevertheless\r\nsure have been submerged at periods comparatively modern; for\r\nnotwithstanding the enduring nature of the marks left by littoral\r\naction on some rocks, especially limestones, we can by no means detect\r\nsea-beaches and inland cliffs everywhere. On the contrary, they are,\r\nupon the whole, extremely partial, and are often entirely wanting in\r\ndistricts composed of argillaceous and sandy formations, which must,\r\nnevertheless, have been upheaved at the same time, and by the same\r\nintermittent movements, as the adjoining harder rocks.\r\n\r\nEscarpments.—Besides the inland cliffs above alluded to which mark the\r\nancient limits of the sea, there are other abrupt terminations of rocks\r\nof various kinds which resemble sea-cliffs, but which have in reality\r\nbeen due to subaërial denudation. These have been called “escarpments,”\r\na term which it is useful to confine to the outcrop of particular\r\nformations having a scarped outline, as distinct from cliffs due to\r\nmarine action.\r\n\r\nI formerly supposed that the steep line of cliff-like slopes seen along\r\nthe outcrop of the chalk, when we follow the edge of the North or South\r\nDowns, was due to marine action; but Professor Ramsay has shown[3] that\r\nthe present outline of the physical geography is more in favour of the\r\nidea of the escarpments having been due to gradual waste since the\r\nrocks were exposed in the atmosphere to the action of rain and rivers.\r\n\r\nMr. Whittaker has given a good summary of the grounds for ascribing\r\nthese apparent sea-cliffs to waste in the open air. 1. There is an\r\nabsence of all signs of ancient sea-beaches or littoral deposits at the\r\nbase of the escarpment. 2. Great inequality is observed in the level of\r\nthe base line. 3. The escarpments do not intersect, like sea-cliffs, a\r\nseries of distinct rocks, but are always confined to the boundary-line\r\nof the same formation. 4. There are sometimes different contiguous and\r\nparallel escarpments—those, for example, of the greensand and\r\nchalk—which are so near each other, and occasionally so similar in\r\naltitude, that we cannot imagine any existing archipelago if converted\r\ninto dry land to present a like outline.\r\n\r\nThe above theory is by no means inconsistent with the opinion that the\r\nlimits of the outcrop of the chalk and greensand which the escarpments\r\nnow follow, were originally determined by marine denudation. When the\r\nsouth-east of England last emerged from beneath the level of the sea,\r\nit was acted upon, no doubt, by the tide, waves, and currents, and the\r\nchalk would form from the first a mass projecting above the more\r\ndestructible clay called Gault. Still the present escarpments so much\r\nresembling sea-cliffs have no doubt, for reasons above stated, derived\r\ntheir most characteristic features subsequently to emergence from\r\nsubaërial waste by rain and rivers.\r\n\r\nSubmarine Denudation.—When we attempt to estimate the amount of\r\nsubmarine denudation, we become sensible of the disadvantage under\r\nwhich we labour from our habitual incapacity of observing the action of\r\nmarine currents on the bed of the sea. We know that the agitation of\r\nthe waves, even during storms, diminishes at a rapid rate, so as to\r\nbecome very insignificant at the depth of a few fathoms, and is quite\r\nimperceptible at the depth of about sixteen fathoms; but when large\r\nbodies of water are transferred by a current from one part of the ocean\r\nto another, they are known to maintain at great depths such a velocity\r\nas must enable them to remove the finer, and sometimes even the\r\ncoarser, materials of the rocks over which they flow. As the\r\nMississippi when more than 150 feet deep can keep open its channel and\r\neven carry down gravel and sand to its delta, the surface velocity\r\nbeing not more than two or three miles an hour, so a gigantic current,\r\nlike the Gulf Stream, equal in volume to many hundred Mississippis, and\r\nhaving in parts a surface velocity of more than three miles, may act as\r\na propelling and abrading power at still greater depths. But the\r\nefficacy of the sea as a denuding agent, geologically considered, is\r\nnot dependent on the power of currents to preserve at great depths a\r\nvelocity sufficient to remove sand and mud, because, even where the\r\ndeposition or removal of sediment is not in progress, the depth of\r\nwater does not remain constant throughout geological time. Every page\r\nof the geological record proves to us that the relative levels of land\r\nand sea, and the position of the ocean and of continents and islands,\r\nhas been always varying, and we may feel sure that some portions of the\r\nsubmarine area are now rising and others sinking. The force of tidal\r\nand other currents and of the waves during storms is sufficient to\r\nprevent the emergence of many lands, even though they may be undergoing\r\ncontinual upheaval. It is not an uncommon error to imagine that the\r\nwaste of sea-cliffs affords the measure of the amount of marine\r\ndenudation of which it probably constitutes an insignificant portion.\r\n\r\nDogger-bank.—That great shoal called the Dogger-bank, about sixty miles\r\neast of the coast of Northumberland, and occupying an area about as\r\nlarge as Wales, has nowhere a depth of more than ninety feet, and in\r\nits shallower parts is less than forty feet under water. It might\r\ncontribute towards the safety of the navigation of our seas to form an\r\nartificial island, and to erect a light-house on this bank; but no\r\nengineer would be rash enough to attempt it, as he would feel sure that\r\nthe ocean in the first heavy gale would sweep it away as readily as it\r\ndoes every temporary shoal that accumulates from time to time around a\r\nsunk vessel on the same bank.[4]\r\n\r\nNo observed geographical changes in historical times entitle us to\r\nassume that where upheaval may be in progress it proceeds at a rapid\r\nrate. Three or four feet rather than as many yards in a century may\r\nprobably be as much as we can reckon upon in our speculations; and if\r\nsuch be the case, the continuance of the upward movement might easily\r\nbe counteracted by the denuding force of such currents aided by such\r\nwaves as, during a gale, are known to prevail in the German Ocean. What\r\nparts of the bed of the ocean are stationary at present, and what areas\r\nmay be rising or sinking, is a matter of which we are very ignorant, as\r\nthe taking of accurate soundings is but of recent date.\r\n\r\n_Newfoundland Bank._—The great bank of Newfoundland may be compared in\r\nsize to the whole of England. This part of the bottom of the Atlantic\r\nis surrounded on three sides by a rapidly deepening ocean, the bank\r\nitself being from twenty to fifty fathoms (or from 120 to 300 feet)\r\nunder water. We are unable to determine by the comparison of different\r\ncharts made at distant periods, whether it is undergoing any change of\r\nlevel, but if it be gradually rising we cannot anticipate on that\r\naccount that it will become land, because the breakers in an open sea\r\nwould exercise a prodigious force even on solid rock brought up to\r\nwithin a few yards of the surface. We know, for example, that when a\r\nnew volcanic island rose in the Mediterranean in 1831, the waves were\r\ncapable in a few years of reducing it to a sunken rock.\r\n\r\nIn the same way currents which flow over the Newfoundland bank a great\r\npart of the year at the rate of two miles an hour, and are known to\r\nretain a considerable velocity to near the bottom, may carry away all\r\nloose sand and mud, and make the emergence of the shoal impossible, in\r\nspite of the accessions of mud, sand, and boulders derived occasionally\r\nfrom melting icebergs which, coming from the northern glaciers, are\r\nfrequently stranded on various parts of the bank. They must often leave\r\nat the bottom large erratic blocks which the marine currents may be\r\nincapable of moving, but the same rocky fragments may be made to sink\r\nby the undermining of beds consisting of finer matter on which the\r\nblocks and gravel repose. In this way gravel and boulders may continue\r\nto overspread a submarine bottom after the latter has been lowered for\r\nhundreds of feet, the surface never having been able to emerge and\r\nbecome land. It is by no means improbable that the annual removal of an\r\naverage thickness of half an inch of rock might counteract the ordinary\r\nupheaval which large submarine areas are undergoing; and the real\r\nenigma which the geologist has to solve is not the extensive denudation\r\nof the white chalk or of our tertiary sands and clays, but the fact\r\nthat such incoherent materials have ever succeeded in lifting up their\r\nheads above water in an open sea. Why were they not swept away during\r\nstorms into some adjoining abysses, the highest parts of each shoal\r\nbeing always planed off down to the depth of a few fathoms? The\r\nhardness and toughness of some rocks already exposed to windward and\r\nacting as breakwaters may perhaps have assisted; nor must we forget the\r\nprotection afforded by a dense and unbroken covering of barnacles,\r\nlimpets, and other creatures which flourish most between high and low\r\nwater and shelter some newly risen coasts from the waves.\r\n\r\n [1] Principles of Geology 7th ed., p. 506; 10th ed., vol. ii, p. 196.\r\n\r\n [2] Second Visit to the United States, vol. i, chap. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n [3] Physical Geography and Geology of Great Britain, p. 78, 1864.\r\n\r\n [4] Principles, 10th ed., vol. i, p. 569.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nJOINT ACTION OF DENUDATION, UPHEAVAL, AND SUBSIDENCE IN REMODELLING THE\r\nEARTH’S CRUST.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow we obtain an Insight at the Surface, of the Arrangement of Rocks at\r\ngreat Depths. — Why the Height of the successive Strata in a given\r\nRegion is so disproportionate to their Thickness. — Computation of the\r\naverage annual Amount of subaërial Denudation. — Antagonism of Volcanic\r\nForce to the Levelling Power of running Water. — How far the Transfer\r\nof Sediment from the Land to a neighbouring Sea-bottom may affect\r\nSubterranean Movements. — Permanence of Continental and Oceanic Areas.\r\n\r\nHow we obtain an Insight at the Surface, of the Arrangement of Rocks at\r\nGreat Depths.— The reader has been already informed that, in the\r\nstructure of the earth’s crust, we often find proofs of the direct\r\nsuperposition of marine to fresh-water strata, and also evidence of the\r\nalternation of deep-sea and shallow-water formations. In order to\r\nexplain how such a series of rocks could be made to form our present\r\ncontinents and islands, we have not only to assume that there have been\r\nalternate upward and downward movements of great vertical extent, but\r\nthat the upheaval in the areas which we at present inhabit has, in\r\nlater geological times, sufficiently predominated over subsidence to\r\ncause these portions of the earth’s crust to be land instead of sea.\r\nThe sinking down of a delta beneath the sea-level may cause strata of\r\nfluviatile or even terrestrial origin, such as peat with trees proper\r\nto marshes, to be covered by deposits of deep-sea origin. There is also\r\nno end to the thickness of mud and sand which may accumulate in shallow\r\nwater, provided that fresh sediment is brought down from the wasting\r\nland at a rate corresponding to that of the sinking of the bed of the\r\nsea. The latter, again, may sometimes sink so fast that the earthy\r\nmatter, being intercepted in some new landward depression, may never\r\nreach its former resting-place, where, the water becoming clear may\r\nfavour the growth of shells and corals, and calcareous rocks of organic\r\norigin may thus be superimposed on mechanical deposits.\r\n\r\nThe succession of strata here alluded to would be consistent with the\r\noccurrence of gradual downward and upward movements of the land and bed\r\nof the sea without any disturbance of the horizontality of the several\r\nformations. But the arrangement of rocks composing the earth’s crust\r\ndiffers materially from that which would result from a mere series of\r\nvertical movements. Had the volcanic forces been confined to such\r\nmovements, and had the stratified rocks been first formed beneath the\r\nsea and then raised above it, without any lateral compression, the\r\ngeologist would never have obtained an insight into the monuments of\r\nvarious ages, some of extremely remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nWhat we have said in Chapter V of dip and strike, of the folding and\r\ninversion of strata, of anticlinal and synclinal flexures, and in\r\nChapter VI of denudation at different periods, whether subaërial or\r\nsubmarine, must be understood before the student can comprehend what\r\nmay at first seem to him an anomaly, but which it is his business\r\nparticularly to understand. I allude to the small height above the\r\nlevel of the sea attained by strata often many miles in thickness, and\r\nabout the chronological succession of which, in one and the same\r\nregion, there is no doubt whatever. Had stratified rocks in general\r\nremained horizontal, the waves of the sea would have been enabled\r\nduring oscillations of level to plane off entirely the uppermost beds\r\nas they rose or sank during the emergence or submergence of the land.\r\nBut the occurrence of a series of formations of widely different ages,\r\nall remaining horizontal and in conformable stratification, is\r\nexceptional, and for this reason the total annihilation of the\r\nuppermost strata has rarely taken place. We owe, indeed, to the side\r\nway movements of _lateral compression_ those anticlinal and synclinal\r\ncurves of the beds already described (Fig. 55), which, together with\r\ndenudation, subaërial and submarine, enable us to investigate the\r\nstructure of the earth’s crust many miles below those points which the\r\nminer can reach. I have already shown in Fig. 56, how, at St. Abb’s\r\nHead, a series of strata of indefinite thickness may become vertical,\r\nand then denuded, so that the edges of the beds alone shall be exposed\r\nto view, the altitude of the upheaved ridges being reduced to a\r\nmoderate height above the sea-level; and it may be observed that\r\nalthough the incumbent strata of Old Red Sandstone are in that place\r\nnearly horizontal, yet these same newer beds will in other places be\r\nfound so folded as to present vertical strata, the edges of which are\r\nabruptly cut off, as in 2, 3, 4 on the right-hand side of the diagram,\r\nFig. 55.\r\n\r\nWhy the Height of the Successive Strata in a given Region is so\r\nDisproportionate to their Thickness.—We cannot too distinctly bear in\r\nmind how dependent we are on the joint action of the volcanic and\r\naqueous forces, the one in\r\ndisturbing the original position of rocks, and the other in destroying\r\nlarge portions of them, for our power of consulting the different pages\r\nand volumes of those stony records of which the crust of the globe is\r\ncomposed. Why, it may be asked, if the ancient bed of the sea has been\r\nin many regions uplifted to the height of two or three miles, and\r\nsometimes twice that altitude, and if it can be proved that some single\r\nformations are of themselves two or three miles thick, do we so often\r\nfind several important groups resting one upon the other, yet attaining\r\nonly the height of a few hundred feet above the level of the sea?\r\n\r\nThe American geologists, after carefully studying the Allegheny or\r\nAppalachian mountains, have ascertained that the older fossiliferous\r\nrocks of that chain (from the Silurian to the Carboniferous inclusive)\r\nare not less than 42,000 feet thick, and if they were now superimposed\r\non each other in the order in which they were thrown down, they ought\r\nto equal in height the Himalayas with the Alps piled upon them. Yet\r\nthey rarely reach an altitude of 5000 feet, and their loftiest peaks\r\nare no more than 7000 feet high. The Carboniferous strata forming the\r\nhighest member of the series, and containing beds of coal, can be shown\r\nto be of shallow-water origin, or even sometimes to have originated in\r\nswamps in the open air. But what is more surprising, the lowest part of\r\nthis great Palæozoic series, instead of having been thrown down at the\r\nbottom of an abyss more than 40,000 feet deep, consists of sediment\r\n(the Potsdam sandstone), evidently spread out on the bottom of a\r\nshallow sea, on which ripple-marked sands were occasionally formed.\r\nThis vast thickness of 40,000 feet is not obtained by adding together\r\nthe maximum density attained by each formation in distant parts of the\r\nchain, but by measuring the successive groups as they are exposed in a\r\nvery limited area, and where the denuded edges of the vertical strata\r\nforming the parallel folds alluded to at page 87 “crop out” at the\r\nsurface. Our attention has been called by Mr. James Hall,\r\nPalæontologist of New York, to the fact that these Palæozoic rocks of\r\nthe Appalachian chain, which are of such enormous density, where they\r\nare almost entirely of mechanical origin, thin out gradually as they\r\nare traced to the westward, where evidently the contemporaneous seas\r\nallowed organic rocks to be formed by corals, echinoderms, and\r\nencrinites in clearer water, and where, although the same successive\r\nperiods are represented, the total mass of strata from the Silurian to\r\nthe Carboniferous, instead of being 40,000 is only 4000 feet thick.\r\n\r\nA like phenomenon is exhibited in every mountainous country, as, for\r\nexample, in the European Alps; but we need not go farther than the\r\nnorth of England for its illustration. Thus in Lancashire and central\r\nEngland the thickness of the Carboniferous formation, including the\r\nMillstone Grit and Yoredale beds, is computed to be more than 18,000\r\nfeet; to this we may add the Mountain Limestone, at least 2000 feet in\r\nthickness, and the overlying Permian and Triassic formations, 3000 or\r\n4000 feet thick. How then does it happen that the loftiest hills of\r\nYorkshire and Lancashire, instead of being 24,000 feet high, never rise\r\nabove 3000 feet? For here, as before pointed out in the Alleghenies,\r\nall the great thicknesses are sometimes found in close approximation\r\nand in a region only a few miles in diameter. It is true that these\r\nsame sets of strata do not preserve their full force when followed for\r\nindefinite distances. Thus the 18,000 feet of Carboniferous grits and\r\nshales in Lancashire, before alluded to, gradually thin out, as Mr.\r\nHull has shown, as they extend southward, by attenuation or original\r\ndeficiency of sediment, and not in consequence of subsequent\r\ndenudation, so that when we have followed them for about 100 miles into\r\nLeicestershire, they have dwindled away to a thickness of only 3000\r\nfeet. In the same region the Carboniferous limestone attains so unusual\r\na thickness—namely, more than 4000 feet—as to appear to compensate in\r\nsome measure for the deficiency of contemporaneous sedimentary rock.[1]\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that when two formations are unconformable their fossil\r\nremains almost always differ considerably. The break in the continuity\r\nof the organic forms seems connected with a great lapse of time, and\r\nthe same interval has allowed extensive disturbance of the strata, and\r\nremoval of parts of them by denudation, to take place. The more we\r\nextend our investigations the more numerous do the proofs of these\r\nbreaks become, and they extend to the most ancient rocks yet\r\ndiscovered. The oldest examples yet brought to light in the British\r\nIsles are on the borders of Rosshire and Sutherlandshire, and have been\r\nwell described by Sir Roderick Murchison, by whom their chronological\r\nrelations were admirably worked out, and proved to be very different\r\nfrom those which previous observers had imagined them to be. I had an\r\nopportunity in the autumn of 1869 of verifying the splendid section\r\ngiven in Fig. 82 by climbing in a few hours from the banks of Loch\r\nAssynt to the summit of the mountain called Queenaig, 2673 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe formations 1, 2, 3, the Laurentian, Cambrian, and\r\nSilurian, to be explained in Chapters XXV and XXVI, not only occur in\r\nsuccession in this one mountain, but their unconformable junctions are\r\ndistinctly exposed to view.\r\n\r\nFig. 82: Unconformable Palæozoic stata, Sutherlandshire (Murchison).\r\n\r\nTo begin with the oldest set of rocks, No. 1; they consist chiefly of\r\nhornblendic gneiss, and in the neighbouring Hebrides form whole\r\nislands, attaining a thickness of thousands of feet, although they have\r\nsuffered such contortions and denudation that they seldom rise more\r\nthan a few hundred feet above the sea-level. In discordant\r\nstratification upon the edges of this gneiss reposes No. 2, a group of\r\nconglomerate and purple sandstone referable to the Cambrian (or\r\nLongmynd) formation, which can elsewhere be shown to be characterised\r\nby its peculiar organic remains. On this again rests No. 3, a lower\r\nmember of the important group called Silurian, an outlier of which, 3′,\r\ncaps the summit of Queenaig, attesting the removal by denudation of\r\nrocks of the same age, which once extended from the great mass 3 to 3′.\r\nAlthough this rock now consists of solid quartz, it is clear that in\r\nits original state it was formed of fine sand, perforated by numerous\r\nlob-worms or annelids, which left their burrows in the shape of tubular\r\nhollows Fig. 563 of _Arenicolites_), hundreds, nay thousands, of which\r\nI saw as I ascended the mountain.\r\n\r\nFig. 83: Diagrammatic section of the same groups near Queenaig\r\n(Murchison).\r\n\r\nIn Queenaig we only behold this single quartzose member of the Silurian\r\nseries, but in the neighbouring country (see Fig. 83) it is seen to the\r\neastward to be followed by limestones, 3_a_, and schists, 3_b_,\r\npresenting numerous folds, and becoming more and more metamorphic and\r\ncrystalline, until at length, although very different in age and\r\nstrike, they much resemble in appearance the group No. 1. It is very\r\nseldom that in the same country one continuous formation, such as the\r\nSilurian, is, as in this case, more fossiliferous and less altered by\r\nvolcanic heat in its older than in its newer strata, and still more\r\nrare to find an underlying and unconformable group like the Cambrian\r\nretaining its original condition of a conglomerate and sandstone more\r\nperfectly than the overlying formation. Here also we may remark in\r\nregard to the origin of these Cambrian rocks that they were evidently\r\nproduced at the expense of the underlying Laurentian, for the rounded\r\npebbles occurring in them are identical in composition and texture with\r\nthat crystalline gneiss which constitutes the contorted beds of the\r\ninferior formation No. 1. When the reader has studied the chapter on\r\nmetamorphism, and has become aware how much modification by heat,\r\npressure, and chemical action is required before the conversion of\r\nsedimentary into crystalline strata can be brought about, he will\r\nappreciate the insight which we thus gain into the date of the changes\r\nwhich had already been effected in the Laurentian rocks long before the\r\nCambrian pebbles of quartz and gneiss were derived from them. The\r\nLaurentian is estimated by Sir William Logan to amount in Canada to\r\n30,000 feet in thickness. As to the Cambrian, it is supposed by Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison that the fragment left in Sutherlandshire is about\r\n3500 feet thick, and in Wales and the borders of Shropshire this\r\nformation may equal 10,000 feet, while the Silurian strata No. 3,\r\ndifficult as it may be to measure them in their various foldings to the\r\neastward, where they have been invaded by intrusive masses of granite,\r\nare supposed many times to surpass the Cambrian in volume and density.\r\n\r\nBut although we are dealing here with stratified rocks, each of which\r\nwould be several miles in thickness, if they were fully represented,\r\nthe whole of them do not attain the elevation of a single mile above\r\nthe level of the sea.\r\n\r\nComputation of the Average Annual Amount of Subaërial Denudation.—The\r\ngeology of the district above alluded to may assist our imagination in\r\nconceiving the extent to which groups of ancient rocks, each of which\r\nmay in their turn have formed continents and oceanic basins, have been\r\ndisturbed, folded, and denuded even in the course of a few out of many\r\nof those geological periods to which our imperfect records relate. It\r\nis not easy for us to overestimate the effects which causes in every\r\nday action must produce when the multiplying power of time is taken\r\ninto account.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made by Manfredi in 1736, and afterwards by Playfair in\r\n1802, to calculate the time which it would require to enable the rivers\r\nto deliver over the whole of the land into the basin of the ocean. The\r\ndata were at first too imperfect and vague to allow them even to\r\napproximate to safe conclusions. But in our own time similar\r\ninvestigations have been renewed with more prospect of success, the\r\namount brought down by many large rivers to the sea having been more\r\naccurately ascertained. Mr. Alfred Tylor, in 1850, inferred that the\r\nquantity of detritus now being distributed over the sea-bottom would,\r\nat the end of 10,000 years, cause an elevation of the sea-level to the\r\nextent of at least three inches.[2] Subsequently Mr. Croll, in 1867,\r\nand again, with more exactness, in 1868, deduced from the latest\r\nmeasurement of the sediment transported by European and American rivers\r\nthe rate of subaërial denudation to which the surface of large\r\ncontinents is exposed, taking especially the hydrographical basin of\r\nthe Mississippi as affording the best available measure of the average\r\nwaste of the land. The conclusion arrived at in his able memoir,[3] was\r\nthat the whole terrestrial surface is denuded at the rate of one foot\r\nin 6000 years and this opinion was simultaneously enforced by his\r\nfellow-labourer, Mr. Geikie, who, being jointly engaged in the same\r\nline of inquiry, published a luminous essay on the subject in 1868.\r\n\r\nThe student, by referring to my “Principles of Geology,”[4] may see\r\nthat Messrs. Humphrey and Abbot, during their survey of the\r\nMississippi, attempted to make accurate measurements of the proportion\r\nof sediment carried down annually to the sea by that river, including\r\nnot only the mud held in suspension, but also the sand and gravel\r\nforced along the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that when we know the dimensions of the area which is\r\ndrained, and the annual quantity of earthy matter taken from it and\r\nborne into the sea, we can affirm how much on an average has been\r\nremoved from the general surface in one year, and there seems no danger\r\nof our overrating the mean rate of waste by selecting the Mississippi\r\nas our example, for that river drains a country equal to more than half\r\nthe continent of Europe, extends through twenty degrees of latitude,\r\nand therefore through regions enjoying a great variety of climate, and\r\nsome of its tributaries descend from mountains of great height. The\r\nMississippi is also more likely to afford us a fair test of ordinary\r\ndenudation, because, unlike the St. Lawrence and its tributaries, there\r\nare no great lakes in which the fluviatile sediment is thrown down and\r\narrested in its way to the sea. In striking a general average we have\r\nto remember that there are large deserts in which there is scarcely any\r\nrainfall, and tracts which are as rainless as parts of Peru, and these\r\nmust not be neglected as counterbalancing others, in the tropics, where\r\nthe quantity of rain is in excess. If then, argues Mr. Geikie, we\r\nassume that the Mississippi is lowering the surface of the great basin\r\nwhich it drains at the rate of one foot in 6000 years, 10 feet in\r\n60,000 years, 100 feet in 600,000 years, and 1000 feet in 6,000,000\r\nyears, it would not require more than about 4,500,000 years to wear\r\naway the whole of the North American continent if its mean height is\r\ncorrectly estimated by Humboldt at 748 feet. And if the mean height of\r\nall the land now above the sea throughout the globe is 1000 feet, as\r\nsome geographers believe, it would only require six million years to\r\nsubject a mass of rock equal in volume to the whole of the land to the\r\naction of subaërial denudation. It may be objected that the annual\r\nwaste is partial, and not equally derived from the general surface of\r\nthe country, inasmuch as plains, water-sheds, and level ground at all\r\nheights remain comparatively unaltered; but this, as Mr. Geikie has\r\nwell pointed out, does not affect our estimate of the sum total of\r\ndenudation. The amount remains the same, and if we allow too little for\r\nthe loss from the surface of table-lands we only increase the\r\nproportion of the loss sustained by the sides and bottoms of the\r\nvalleys, and _vice versa._[5]\r\n\r\nAntagonism of Volcanic Force to the Levelling Power of Running\r\nWater.—In all these estimates it is assumed that the entire quantity of\r\nland above the sea-level remains on an average undiminished in spite of\r\nannual waste. Were it otherwise the subaërial denudation would be\r\ncontinually lessened by the diminution of the height and dimensions of\r\nthe land exposed to waste. Unfortunately we have as yet no accurate\r\ndata enabling us to measure the action of that force by which the\r\ninequalities of the surface of the earth’s crust may be restored, and\r\nthe height of the continents and depth of the seas made to continue\r\nunimpaired. I stated in 1830 in the “Principles of Geology,”[6] that\r\nrunning water and volcanic action are two antagonistic forces; the one\r\nlabouring continually to reduce the whole of the land to the level of\r\nthe sea, the other to restore and maintain the inequalities of the\r\ncrust on which the very existence of islands and continents depends. I\r\nstated, however, that when we endeavour to form some idea of the\r\nrelation of these destroying and renovating forces, we must always bear\r\nin mind that it is not simply by upheaval that subterranean movements\r\ncan counteract the levelling force of running water. For whereas the\r\ntransportation of sediment from the land to the ocean would raise the\r\ngeneral sea-level, the subsidence of the sea-bottom, by increasing its\r\ncapacity, would check this rise and prevent the submergence of the\r\nland. I have, indeed, endeavoured to show that unless we assume that\r\nthere is, on the whole, more subsidence than upheaval, we must suppose\r\nthe diameter of the planet to be always increasing, by that quantity of\r\nvolcanic matter which is annually poured out in the shape of lava or\r\nashes, whether on the land or in the bed of the sea, and which is\r\nderived from the interior of the earth. The abstraction of this matter\r\ncauses, no doubt, subterranean vacuities and a corresponding giving way\r\nof the surface; if it were not so, the average density of parts of the\r\ninterior would be always lessening and the size of the planet\r\nincreasing.[7]\r\n\r\nOur inability to estimate the amount or direction of the movements due\r\nto volcanic power by no means renders its efficacy as a land-preserving\r\nforce in past times a mere matter of conjecture. The student will see\r\nin Chapter XXIV that we have proofs of Carboniferous forests hundreds\r\nof miles in extent which grew on the lowlands or deltas near the sea,\r\nand which subsided and gave place to other forests, until in some\r\nregions fluviatile and shallow-water strata with occasional seams of\r\ncoal were piled one over the other, till they attained a thickness of\r\nmany thousand feet. Such accumulations, observed in Great Britain and\r\nAmerica on opposite sides of the Atlantic, imply the long-continued\r\nexistence of land vegetation, and of rivers draining a former continent\r\nplaced where there is now deep sea.\r\n\r\nIt will be also seen in Chapter XXV that we have evidence of a rich\r\nterrestrial flora, the Devonian, even more ancient than the\r\nCarboniferous; while on the other hand, the later Triassic, Oolitic,\r\nCretaceous, and successive Tertiary periods have all supplied us with\r\nfossil plants, insects, or terrestrial mammalia; showing that, in spite\r\nof great oscillations of level and continued changes in the position of\r\nland and sea, the volcanic forces have maintained a due proportion of\r\ndry land. We may appeal also to fresh-water formations, such as the\r\nPurbeck and Wealden, to prove that in the Oolitic and Neocomian eras\r\nthere were rivers draining ancient lands in Europe in times when we\r\nknow that other spaces, now above water, were submerged.\r\n\r\nHow far the Transfer of Sediment from the Land to a Neighbouring\r\nSea-bottom may affect Subterranean Movements.—Little as we understand\r\nat present the laws which govern the distribution of volcanic heat in\r\nthe interior and crust of the globe, by which mountain chains, high\r\ntable-lands, and the abysses of the ocean are formed, it seems clear\r\nthat this heat is the prime mover on which all the grander features in\r\nthe external configuration of the planet depend.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the stripping off by denudation of dense\r\nmasses from one part of a continent and the delivery of the same into\r\nthe bed of the ocean must have a decided effect in causing changes of\r\ntemperature in the earth’s crust below, or, in other words, in causing\r\nthe subterranean isothermals to shift their position. If this be so,\r\none part of the crust may be made to rise, and another to sink, by the\r\nexpansion and contraction of the rocks, of which the temperature is\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nI cannot, at present, discuss this subject, of which I have treated\r\nmore fully elsewhere,[8] but may state here that I believe this\r\ntransfer of sediment to play a very subordinate part in modifying those\r\nmovements on which the configuration of the earth’s crust depends. In\r\norder that strata of shallow-water origin should be able to attain a\r\nthickness of several thousand feet, and so come to exert a considerable\r\ndownward pressure, there must have been first some independent and\r\nantecedent causes at work which have given rise to the incipient\r\nshallow receptacle in which the sediment began to accumulate. The same\r\ncauses there continuing to depress the sea-bottom, room would be made\r\nfor fresh accessions of sediment, and it would only be by a long\r\nrepetition of the depositing process that the new matter could acquire\r\nweight enough to affect the temperature of the rocks far below, so as\r\nto increase or diminish their volume.\r\n\r\nPermanence of Continental and Oceanic Areas.—If the thickness of more\r\nthan 40,000 feet of sedimentary strata before alluded to in the\r\nAppalachians proves a preponderance of downward movements in Palæozoic\r\ntimes in a district now forming the eastern border of North America, it\r\nalso proves, as before hinted, the continued existence and waste of\r\nsome neighbouring continent, probably formed of Laurentian rocks, and\r\nsituated where the Atlantic now prevails. Such an hypothesis would be\r\nin perfect harmony with the conclusions forced upon us by the study of\r\nthe present configuration of our continents, and the relation of their\r\nheight to the depth of the oceanic basins; also to the considerable\r\nelevation and extent sometimes reached by drift containing shells of\r\nrecent species, and still more by the fact of sedimentary strata,\r\nseveral thousand feet thick, as those of central Sicily, or such as\r\nflank the Alps and Apennines, containing fossil Mollusca sometimes\r\nalmost wholly identical with species still living.\r\n\r\nI have remarked elsewhere[9] that upward and downward movements of 1000\r\nfeet or more would turn much land into sea and sea into land in the\r\ncontinental areas and their borders, whereas oscillations of equal\r\nmagnitude would have no corresponding effect in the bed of the ocean\r\ngenerally, believed as it is to have a mean depth of 15,000 feet, and\r\nwhich, whether this estimate be correct or not, is certainly of great\r\nprofundity. Subaërial denudation would not of itself lessen the area of\r\nthe land, but would tend to fill up with sediment seas of moderate\r\ndepth adjoining the coast. The coarser matter falls to the bottom near\r\nthe shore in the first still water which it reaches, and whenever the\r\nsea-bottom on which this matter has been thrown is slightly elevated,\r\nit becomes land, and an upheaval of a thousand feet causes it to attain\r\nthe mean elevation of continents in general.\r\n\r\nSuppose, therefore, we had ascertained that the triturating power of\r\nsubaërial denudation might in a given time—in three, or six, or a\r\ngreater number of millions of years—pulverise a volume of rock equal in\r\ndimensions to all the present land, we might yet find, could we revisit\r\nthe earth at the end of such a period, that the continents occupied\r\nvery much the same position which they held before; we should find the\r\nrivers employed in carrying down to the sea the very same mud, sand,\r\nand pebbles with which they had been charged in our own time, the\r\nsuperficial alluvial matter as well as a great thickness of sedimentary\r\nstrata would inclose shells, all or a great part of which we should\r\nrecognise as specifically identical with those already known to us as\r\nliving. Every geologist is aware that great as have been the\r\ngeographical changes in the northern hemisphere since the commencement\r\nof the Glacial Period, there having been submergence and re-emergence\r\nof land to the extent of 1000 feet vertically, and in the temperate\r\nlatitudes great vicissitudes of climate, the marine mollusca have not\r\nchanged, and the same drift which had been carried down to the sea at\r\nthe beginning of the period is now undergoing a second transportation\r\nin the same direction.\r\n\r\nAs when we have measured a fraction of time in an hour-glass we have\r\nonly to reverse the position of our chronometer and we make the same\r\nsand measure over again the duration of a second equal period, so when\r\nthe volcanic force has remoulded the form of a continent and the\r\nadjoining sea-bottom, the same materials are made to do duty a second\r\ntime. It is true that at each oscillation of level the solid rocks\r\ncomposing the original continent suffer some fresh denudation, and do\r\nnot remain unimpaired like the wooden and glass framework of the\r\nhour-glass, still the wear and tear suffered by the larger area exposed\r\nto subaërial denudation consists either of loose drift or of\r\nsedimentary strata, which were thrown down in seas near the land, and\r\nsubsequently upraised, the same continents and oceanic basins remaining\r\nin existence all the while.\r\n\r\nFrom all that we know of the extreme slowness of the upward and\r\ndownward movements which bring about even slight geographical changes,\r\nwe may infer that it would require a long succession of geological\r\nperiods to cause the submarine and supramarine areas to change places,\r\neven if the ascending movements in the one region and the descending in\r\nthe other were continuously in one direction. But we have only to\r\nappeal to the structure of the Alps, where there are so many shallow\r\nand deep water formations of various ages crowded into a limited area,\r\nto convince ourselves that mountain chains are the result of great\r\noscillations of level. High land is not produced simply by uniform\r\nupheaval, but by a predominance of elevatory over subsiding movements.\r\nWhere the ocean is extremely deep it is because the sinking of the\r\nbottom has been in excess, in spite of interruptions by upheaval.\r\n\r\nYet persistent as may be the leading features of land and sea on the\r\nglobe, they are not immutable. Some of the finest mud is doubtless\r\ncarried to indefinite distances from the coast by marine currents, and\r\nwe are taught by deep-sea dredgings that in clear water at depths\r\nequalling the height of the Alps organic beings may flourish, and their\r\nspoils slowly accumulate on the bottom. We also occasionally obtain\r\nevidence that submarine volcanoes are pouring out ashes and streams of\r\nlava in mid-ocean as well as on land (see Principles, vol. ii, p. 64),\r\nand that wherever mountains like Etna, Vesuvius, and the Canary Islands\r\nare now the site of eruptions, there are signs of accompanying\r\nupheaval, by which beds of ashes full of recent marine shells have been\r\nuplifted many hundred feet. We need not be surprised, therefore, if we\r\nlearn from geology that the continents and oceans were not always\r\nplaced where they now are, although the imagination may well be\r\noverpowered when it endeavours to contemplate the quantity of time\r\nrequired for such revolutions.\r\n\r\nWe shall have gained a great step if we can approximate to the number\r\nof millions of years in which the average aqueous denudation going on\r\nupon the land would convey seaward a quantity of matter equal to the\r\naverage volume of our continents, and this might give us a gauge of the\r\nminimum of volcanic force necessary to counteract such levelling power\r\nof running water; but to discover a relation between these great\r\nagencies and the rate at which species of organic beings vary, is at\r\npresent wholly beyond the reach of our computation, though perhaps it\r\nmay not prove eventually to transcend the powers of man.\r\n\r\n [1] Hull, Quart.

In regard to the aqueous rocks, we have already seen that\r\nthey are stratified, that some are calcareous, others argillaceous or\r\nsiliceous, some made up of sand, others of pebbles; that some contain\r\nfresh-water, others marine fossils, and so forth; but the student has\r\nstill to learn which rocks, exhibiting some or all of these characters,\r\nhave originated at one period of the earth’s history, and which at\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nTo determine this point in reference to the fossiliferous formations is\r\nmore easy than in any other class, and it is therefore the most\r\nconvenient and natural method to begin by establishing a chronology for\r\nthese strata, and then to refer as far as possible to the same\r\ndivisions, the several groups of Plutonic, volcanic, and metamorphic\r\nrocks. Such a system of classification is not only recommended by its\r\ngreater clearness and facility of application, but is also best fitted\r\nto strike the imagination by bringing into one view the contemporaneous\r\nrevolutions of the inorganic and organic creations of former times. For\r\nthe sedimentary formations are most readily distinguished by the\r\ndifferent species of fossil animals and plants which they inclose, and\r\nof which one assemblage after another has flourished and then\r\ndisappeared from the earth in succession.\r\n\r\nIn the present work, therefore, the four great classes of rocks, the\r\naqueous, Plutonic, volcanic, and metamorphic, will form four parallel,\r\nor nearly parallel, columns in one chronological table. They will be\r\nconsidered as four sets of monuments relating to four contemporaneous,\r\nor nearly contemporaneous, series of events. I shall endeavour, in a\r\nsubsequent chapter on the Plutonic rocks, to explain the manner in\r\nwhich certain masses belonging to each of the four classes of rocks may\r\nhave originated simultaneously at every geological period, and how the\r\nearth’s crust may have been continually remodelled, above and below, by\r\naqueous and igneous causes, from times indefinitely remote. In the same\r\nmanner as aqueous and fossiliferous strata are now formed in certain\r\nseas or lakes, while in other places volcanic rocks break out at the\r\nsurface, and are connected with reservoirs of melted matter at vast\r\ndepths in the bowels of the earth, so, at every era of the past,\r\nfossiliferous deposits and superficial igneous rocks were in progress\r\ncontemporaneously with others of subterranean and Plutonic origin, and\r\nsome sedimentary strata were exposed to heat, and made to assume a\r\ncrystalline or metamorphic structure.\r\n\r\nIt can by no means be taken for granted, that during all these changes\r\nthe solid crust of the earth has been increasing in thickness. It has\r\nbeen shown, that so far as aqueous action is concerned, the gain by\r\nfresh deposits, and the loss by denudation, must at each period have\r\nbeen equal (see above, Chap. VI, p. 96); and in like manner, in the\r\ninferior portion of the earth’s crust, the acquisition of new\r\ncrystalline rocks, at each successive era, may merely have\r\ncounterbalanced the loss sustained by the melting of materials\r\npreviously consolidated. As to the relative antiquity of the\r\ncrystalline foundations of the earth’s crust, when compared to the\r\nfossiliferous and volcanic rocks which they support, I have already\r\nstated, in the first chapter, that to pronounce an opinion on this\r\nmatter is as difficult as at once to decide which of the two, whether\r\nthe foundations or superstructure of an ancient city built on wooden\r\npiles may be the oldest. We have seen that, to answer this question, we\r\nmust first be prepared to say whether the work of decay and restoration\r\nhad gone on most rapidly above or below; whether the average duration\r\nof the piles has exceeded that of the buildings, or the contrary. So\r\nalso in regard to the relative age of the superior and inferior\r\nportions of the earth’s crust; we cannot hazard even a conjecture on\r\nthis point, until we know whether, upon an average, the power of water\r\nabove, or that of heat below, is most efficacious in giving new forms\r\nto solid matter.\r\n\r\nThe early geologists gave to all the crystalline and non-fossiliferous\r\nrocks the name of Primitive or Primary, under the idea that they were\r\nformed anterior to the appearance of life upon the earth, while the\r\naqueous or fossiliferous strata were termed Secondary, and alluviums or\r\nother superficial deposits, Tertiary. The meaning of these terms, has,\r\nhowever, been gradually modified with advancing knowledge, and they are\r\nnow used to designate three great chronological divisions under which\r\nall geological formations can be classed, each of them being\r\ncharacterised by the presence of distinctive groups of organic remains\r\nrather than by any mechanical peculiarities of the strata themselves.\r\nIf, therefore, we retain the term “primary,” it must not be held to\r\ndesignate a set of crystalline rocks some of which have been proved to\r\nbe even of Tertiary age, but must be applied to all rocks older than\r\nthe secondary formations. Some geologists, to avoid misapprehension,\r\nhave introduced the term Palæozoic for primary, from _palaion,_\r\n“ancient,” and _zoon,_ “an organic being,” still retaining the terms\r\nsecondary and tertiary; Mr. Phillips, for the sake of uniformity, has\r\nproposed Mesozoic, for secondary, from _mesos,_ “middle,” etc.; and\r\nCainozoic, for tertiary, from _kainos,_ “recent,” etc.; but the terms\r\nprimary, secondary, and tertiary have the claim of priority in their\r\nfavour, and are of corresponding value.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be suggested that some metamorphic strata, and some\r\ngranites, may be anterior in date to the oldest of the primary\r\nfossiliferous rocks. This opinion is doubtless true, and will be\r\ndiscussed in future chapters; but I may here observe, that when we\r\narrange the four classes of rocks in four parallel columns in one table\r\nof chronology, it is by no means assumed that these columns are all of\r\nequal length; one may begin at an earlier period than the rest, and\r\nanother may come down to a later point of time, and we may not be yet\r\nacquainted with the most ancient of the primary fossiliferous beds, or\r\nwith the newest of the hypogene.\r\n\r\nFor reasons already stated, I proceed first to treat of the aqueous or\r\nfossiliferous formations considered in chronological order or in\r\nrelation to the different periods at which they have been deposited.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal tests by which we determine the age of a\r\ngiven set of strata; first, superposition; secondly, mineral character;\r\nand, thirdly, organic remains. Some aid can occasionally be derived\r\nfrom a fourth kind of proof, namely, the fact of one deposit including\r\nin it fragments of a pre-existing rock, by which the relative ages of\r\nthe two may, even in the absence of all other evidence, be determined.\r\n\r\nSuperposition.—The first and principal test of the age of one aqueous\r\ndeposit, as compared to another, is relative position. It has been\r\nalready stated, that, where strata are horizontal, the bed which lies\r\nuppermost is the newest of the whole, and that which lies at the bottom\r\nthe most ancient. So, of a series of sedimentary formations, they are\r\nlike volumes of history, in which each writer has recorded the annals\r\nof his own times, and then laid down the book, with the last written\r\npage uppermost, upon the volume in which the events of the era\r\nimmediately preceding were commemorated. In this manner a lofty pile of\r\nchronicles is at length accumulated; and they are so arranged as to\r\nindicate, by their position alone, the order in which the events\r\nrecorded in them have occurred.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the crust of the earth, however, there are some regions\r\nwhere, as the student has already been informed, the beds have been\r\ndisturbed, and sometimes extensively thrown over and turned upside\r\ndown. (See p. 73, p. 87.) But an experienced geologist can rarely be\r\ndeceived by these exceptional cases. When he finds that the strata are\r\nfractured, curved, inclined, or vertical, he knows that the original\r\norder of superposition must be doubtful, and he then endeavours to find\r\nsections in some neighbouring district where the strata are horizontal,\r\nor only slightly inclined. Here, the true order of sequence of the\r\nentire series of deposits being ascertained, a key is furnished for\r\nsettling the chronology of those strata where the displacement is\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\nMineral Character.—The same rocks may often be observed to retain for\r\nmiles, or even hundreds of miles, the same mineral peculiarities, if we\r\nfollow the planes of stratification, or trace the beds, if they be\r\nundisturbed, in a horizontal direction. But if we pursue them\r\nvertically, or in any direction transverse to the planes of\r\nstratification, this uniformity ceases almost immediately. In that case\r\nwe can scarcely ever penetrate a stratified mass for a few hundred\r\nyards without beholding a succession of extremely dissimilar rocks,\r\nsome of fine, others of coarse grain, some of mechanical, others of\r\nchemical origin; some calcareous, others argillaceous, and others\r\nsiliceous. These phenomena lead to the conclusion that rivers and\r\ncurrents have dispersed the same sediment over wide areas at one\r\nperiod, but at successive periods have been charged, in the same\r\nregion, with very different kinds of matter. The first observers were\r\nso astonished at the vast spaces over which they were able to follow\r\nthe same homogeneous rocks in a horizontal direction, that they came\r\nhastily to the opinion, that the whole globe had been environed by a\r\nsuccession of distinct aqueous formations, disposed round the nucleus\r\nof the planet, like the concentric coats of an onion. But, although, in\r\nfact, some formations may be continuous over districts as large as half\r\nof Europe, or even more, yet most of them either terminate wholly\r\nwithin narrower limits, or soon change their lithological character.\r\nSometimes they thin out gradually, as if the supply of sediment had\r\nfailed in that direction, or they come abruptly to an end, as if we had\r\narrived at the borders of the ancient sea or lake which served as their\r\nreceptacle. It no less frequently happens that they vary in mineral\r\naspect and composition, as we pursue them horizontally. For example, we\r\ntrace a limestone for a hundred miles, until it becomes more\r\narenaceous, and finally passes into sand, or sandstone. We may then\r\nfollow this sandstone, already proved by its continuity to be of the\r\nsame age, throughout another district a hundred miles or more in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nOrganic Remains.—This character must be used as a criterion of the age\r\nof a formation, or of the contemporaneous origin of two deposits in\r\ndistant places, under very much the same restrictions as the test of\r\nmineral composition.\r\n\r\nFirst, the same fossils may be traced over wide regions, if we examine\r\nstrata in the direction of their planes, although by no means for\r\nindefinite distances. Secondly, while the same fossils prevail in a\r\nparticular set of strata for hundreds of miles in a horizontal\r\ndirection, we seldom meet with the same remains for many fathoms, and\r\nvery rarely for several hundred yards, in a vertical line, or a line\r\ntransverse to the strata. This fact has now been verified in almost all\r\nparts of the globe, and has led to a conviction that at successive\r\nperiods of the past, the same area of land and water has been inhabited\r\nby species of animals and plants even more distinct than those which\r\nnow people the antipodes, or which now co-exist in the arctic,\r\ntemperate, and tropical zones. It appears that from the remotest\r\nperiods there has been ever a coming in of new organic forms, and an\r\nextinction of those which pre-existed on the earth; some species having\r\nendured for a longer, others for a shorter, time; while none have ever\r\nreappeared after once dying out. The law which has governed the\r\nsuccession of species, whether we adopt or reject the theory of\r\ntransmutation, seems to be expressed in the verse of the poet:—\r\n\r\n                Natura il fece, e poi ruppe la stampa. ARIOSTO.\r\n                Nature made him, and then broke the die.\r\n\r\nAnd this circumstance it is, which confers on fossils their highest\r\nvalue as chronological tests, giving to each of them, in the eyes of\r\nthe geologist, that authority which belongs to contemporary medals in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe same cannot be said of each peculiar variety of rock; for some of\r\nthese, as red marl and red sandstone, for example, may occur at once at\r\nthe top, bottom, and middle of the entire sedimentary series;\r\nexhibiting in each position so perfect an identity of mineral aspect as\r\nto be undistinguishable. Such exact repetitions, however, of the same\r\nmixtures of sediment have not often been produced, at distant periods,\r\nin precisely the same parts of the globe; and even where this has\r\nhappened, we are seldom in any danger of confounding together the\r\nmonuments of remote eras, when we have studied their imbedded fossils\r\nand their relative position.\r\n\r\nZoological Provinces.—It was remarked that the same species of organic\r\nremains cannot be traced horizontally, or in the direction of the\r\nplanes of stratifications for indefinite distances. This might have\r\nbeen expected from analogy; for when we inquire into the present\r\ndistribution of living beings, we find that the habitable surface of\r\nthe sea and land may be divided into a considerable number of distinct\r\nprovinces, each peopled by a peculiar assemblage of animals and plants.\r\nIn the “Principles of Geology,” I have endeavoured to point out the\r\nextent and probable origin of these separate divisions; and it was\r\nshown that climate is only one of many causes on which they depend, and\r\nthat difference of longitude as well as latitude is generally\r\naccompanied by a dissimilarity of indigenous species.\r\n\r\nAs different seas, therefore, and lakes are inhabited, at the same\r\nperiod, by different aquatic animals and plants, and as the lands\r\nadjoining these may be peopled by distinct terrestrial species, it\r\nfollows that distinct fossils will be imbedded in contemporaneous\r\ndeposits. If it were otherwise—if the same species abounded in every\r\nclimate, or in every part of the globe where, so far as we can\r\ndiscover, a corresponding temperature and other conditions favourable\r\nto their existence are found—the identification of mineral masses of\r\nthe same age, by means of their included organic contents, would be a\r\nmatter of still greater certainty.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the extent of some single zoological provinces,\r\nespecially those of marine animals, is very great; and our geological\r\nresearches have proved that the same laws prevailed at remote periods;\r\nfor the fossils are often identical throughout wide spaces, and in\r\ndetached deposits, consisting of rocks varying entirely in their\r\nmineral nature.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine here laid down will be more readily understood, if we\r\nreflect on what is now going on in the Mediterranean. That entire sea\r\nmay be considered as one zoological province; for although certain\r\nspecies of testacea and zoophytes may be very local, and each region\r\nhas probably some species peculiar to it, still a considerable number\r\nare common to the whole Mediterranean. If, therefore, at some future\r\nperiod, the bed of this inland sea should be converted into land, the\r\ngeologist might be enabled, by reference to organic remains, to prove\r\nthe contemporaneous origin of various mineral masses scattered over a\r\nspace equal in area to half of Europe.\r\n\r\nDeposits, for example, are well known to be now in progress in this sea\r\nin the deltas of the Po, Rhone, Nile, and other rivers, which differ as\r\ngreatly from each other in the nature of their sediment as does the\r\ncomposition of the mountains which their drain. There are also other\r\nquarters of the Mediterranean, as off the coast of Campania, or near\r\nthe base of Etna, in Sicily, or in the Grecian Archipelago, where\r\nanother class of rocks is now forming; where showers of volcanic ashes\r\noccasionally fall into the sea, and streams of lava overflow its\r\nbottom; and where, in the intervals between volcanic eruptions, beds of\r\nsand and clay are frequently derived from the waste of cliffs, or the\r\nturbid waters of rivers. Limestones, moreover, such as the Italian\r\ntravertins, are here and there precipitated from the waters of mineral\r\nsprings, some of which rise up from the bottom of the sea. In all these\r\ndetached formations, so diversified in their lithological characters,\r\nthe remains of the same shells, corals, crustacea, and fish are\r\nbecoming inclosed; or, at least, a sufficient number must be common to\r\nthe different localities to enable the zoologist to refer them all to\r\none contemporaneous assemblage of species.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain combinations of geographical circumstances\r\nwhich cause distinct provinces of animals and plants to be separated\r\nfrom each other by very narrow limits; and hence it must happen that\r\nstrata will be sometimes formed in contiguous regions, differing widely\r\nboth in mineral contents and organic remains. Thus, for example, the\r\ntestacea, zoophytes, and fish of the Red Sea are, as a group, extremely\r\ndistinct from those inhabiting the adjoining parts of the\r\nMediterranean, although the two seas are separated only by the narrow\r\nisthmus of Suez. Calcareous formations have accumulated on a great\r\nscale in the Red Sea in modern times, and fossil shells of existing\r\nspecies are well preserved therein; and we know that at the mouth of\r\nthe Nile large deposits of mud are amassed, including the remains of\r\nMediterranean species. It follows, therefore, that if at some future\r\nperiod the bed of the Red Sea should be laid dry, the geologist might\r\nexperience great difficulties in endeavouring to ascertain the relative\r\nage of these formations, which, although dissimilar both in organic and\r\nmineral characters, were of synchronous origin.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, we must not forget that the north-western\r\nshores of the Arabian Gulf, the plains of Egypt, and the Isthmus of\r\nSuez, are all parts of one province of _terrestrial_ species. Small\r\nstreams, therefore, occasional land- floods, and those winds which\r\ndrift clouds of sand along the deserts, might carry down into the Red\r\nSea the same shells of fluviatile and land testacea which the Nile is\r\nsweeping into its delta, together with some remains of terrestrial\r\nplants and the bones of quadrupeds, whereby the groups of strata before\r\nalluded to might, notwithstanding the discrepancy of their mineral\r\ncomposition and _marine_ organic fossils, be shown to have belonged to\r\nthe same epoch.\r\n\r\nYet, while rivers may thus carry down the same fluviatile and\r\nterrestrial spoils into two or more seas inhabited by different marine\r\nspecies, it will much more frequently happen that the coexistence of\r\nterrestrial species of distinct zoological and botanical provinces will\r\nbe proved by the identity of the marine beings which inhabited the\r\nintervening space. Thus, for example, the land quadrupeds and shells of\r\nthe valley of the Mississippi, of central America, and of the West\r\nIndia islands differ very considerably, yet their remains are all\r\nwashed down by rivers flowing from these three zoological provinces\r\ninto the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the globe, at the present period, the line of\r\ndemarkation between distinct provinces of animals and plants is not\r\nvery strongly marked, especially where the change is determined by\r\ntemperature, as it is in seas extending from the temperate to the\r\ntropical zone, or from the temperate to the arctic regions. Here a\r\ngradual passage takes place from one set of species to another. In like\r\nmanner the geologist, in studying particular formations of remote\r\nperiods, has sometimes been able to trace the gradation from one\r\nancient province to another, by observing carefully the fossils of all\r\nthe intermediate places. His success in thus acquiring a knowledge of\r\nthe zoological or botanical geography of very distant eras has been\r\nmainly owing to this circumstance, that the mineral character has no\r\ntendency to be affected by climate. A large river may convey yellow or\r\nred mud into some part of the ocean, where it may be dispersed by a\r\ncurrent over an area several hundred leagues in length, so as to pass\r\nfrom the tropics into the temperate zone. If the bottom of the sea be\r\nafterwards upraised, the organic remains imbedded in such yellow or red\r\nstrata may indicate the different animals or plants which once\r\ninhabited at the same time the temperate and equatorial regions.\r\n\r\nIt may be true, as a general rule, that groups of the same species of\r\nanimals and plants may extend over wider areas than deposits of\r\nhomogeneous composition; and if so, palæontological characters will be\r\nof more importance in geological classification than the test of\r\nmineral composition; but it is idle to discuss the relative value of\r\nthese tests, as the aid of both is indispensable, and it fortunately\r\nhappens, that where the one criterion fails, we can often avail\r\nourselves of the other.\r\n\r\nTest by included Fragments of older Rocks.—It was stated, that proof\r\nmay sometimes be obtained of the relative date of two formations by\r\nfragments of an older rock being included in a newer one. This evidence\r\nmay sometimes be of great use, where a geologist is at a loss to\r\ndetermine the relative age of two formations from want of clear\r\nsections exhibiting their true order of position, or because the strata\r\nof each group are vertical. In such cases we sometimes discover that\r\nthe more modern rock has been in part derived from the degradation of\r\nthe older. Thus, for example, we may find chalk in one part of a\r\ncountry, and in another strata of clay, sand, and pebbles. If some of\r\nthese pebbles consist of that peculiar flint, of which layers more or\r\nless continuous are characteristic of the chalk, and which include\r\nfossil shells, sponges, and foraminifera of cretaceous species, we may\r\nconfidently infer that the chalk was the oldest of the two formations.\r\n\r\nChronological Groups.—The number of groups into which the fossiliferous\r\nstrata may be separated are more or less numerous, according to the\r\nviews of classification which different geologists entertain; but when\r\nwe have adopted a certain system of arrangement, we immediately find\r\nthat a few only of the entire series of groups occur one upon the other\r\nin any single section or district.\r\n\r\nThe thinning out of individual strata was before described (p. 42).But\r\nlet the diagram (Fig. 84) represent seven fossiliferous groups, instead\r\nof as many strata. It will then be seen that in the middle all the\r\nsuperimposed formations are present; but in consequence of some of them\r\nthinning out, No. 2 and No. 5 are absent at one extremity of the\r\nsection, and No. 4 at the other.\r\n\r\nFig. 84: Seven fossiliferous groups.\r\n\r\nIn another diagram (Fig. 85), a real section of the geological\r\nformations in the neighbourhood of Bristol and the Mendip Hills is\r\npresented to the reader, as laid down on a true scale by Professor\r\nRamsay, where the newer groups 1, 2, 3, 4 rest unconformably on the\r\nformations 5, 6, 7 and 8. At the southern end of the line of section we\r\nmeet with the beds No. 3 (the New Red Sandstone) resting immediately on\r\nNos. 7 and 8, while farther north as at Dundry Hill in Somersetshire,\r\nwe behold eight groups superimposed one upon the other, comprising all\r\nthe strata from the inferior Oolite, No. 1, to the coal and\r\ncarboniferous limestone. The limited horizontal extension of the groups\r\n1 and 2 is owing to denudation, as these formations end abruptly, and\r\nhave left outlying patches to attest the fact of their having\r\noriginally covered a much wider area.\r\n\r\nSection South of Bristol.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to establish a chronological succession of\r\nfossiliferous groups, a geologist must begin with a single section in\r\nwhich several sets of strata lie one upon the other. He must then trace\r\nthese formations, by attention to their mineral character and fossils,\r\ncontinuously, as far as possible, from the starting-point. As often as\r\nhe meets with new groups, he must ascertain by superposition their age\r\nrelatively to those first examined, and thus learn how to intercalate\r\nthem in a tabular arrangement of the whole.\r\n\r\nBy this means the German, French, and English geologists have\r\ndetermined the succession of strata throughout a great part of Europe,\r\nand have adopted pretty generally the following groups, almost all of\r\nwhich have their representatives in the British Islands.\r\n\r\nAbridged General Table of Fossiliferous Strata.\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW OF THE FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA,\r\nSHOWING THE ORDER OF SUPERPOSITION OR CHRONOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF THE\r\nPRINCIPAL GROUPS DESCRIBED IN THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-TERTIARY\r\nEXAMPLES\r\n\r\nPOST-TERTIARY\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-\r\n\r\nTERTIARY 1.\r\n\r\nRECENT\r\n\r\nShells and mammals, all of living species.

In nature, as before hinted (p. 107), we have never\r\nan opportunity of seeing the whole of them so displayed in a single\r\nregion; first, because sedimentary deposition is confined, during any\r\none geological period, to limited areas; and secondly, because strata,\r\nafter they have been formed, are liable to be utterly annihilated over\r\nwide areas by denudation. But wherever certain members of the series\r\nare present, they overlie one another in the order indicated in the\r\ndiagram, though not always in the exact manner there represented,\r\nbecause some of them repose occasionally in unconformable\r\nstratification on others. This mode of superposition has been already\r\nexplained (p. 94, p. 111), where I pointed out that the discordance\r\nwhich implies a considerable lapse of time between two formations in\r\njuxtaposition is almost invariably accompanied by a great dissimilarity\r\nin the species of organic remains.\r\n\r\nFrequent Unconformability of Strata.—Where the widest gaps appear in\r\nthe sequence of the fossil forms, as between the Permian and Triassic\r\nrocks, or between the Cretaceous and Eocene, examples of such\r\nunconformability are very frequent. But they are also met with in some\r\npart or other of the world at the junction of almost all the other\r\nprincipal formations, and sometimes the subordinate divisions of any\r\none of the leading groups may be found lying unconformably on another\r\nsubordinate member of the same—the Upper, for example, on the Lower\r\nSilurian, or the superior division of the Old Red Sandstone on a lower\r\nmember of the same, and so forth. Instances of such irregularities in\r\nthe mode of succession of the strata are the more intelligible the more\r\nwe extend our survey of the fossiliferous formations, for we are\r\ncontinually bringing to light deposits of intermediate date, which have\r\nto be intercalated between those previously known, and which reveal to\r\nus a long series of events, of which antecedently to such discoveries\r\nwe had no knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut while unconformability invariably bears testimony to a lapse of\r\nunrepresented time, the conformability of two sets of strata in contact\r\nby no means implies that the newer formation immediately succeeded the\r\nolder one. It simply implies that the ancient rocks were subjected to\r\nno movements of such a nature as to tilt, bend, or break them before\r\nthe more modern formation was superimposed. It does not show that the\r\nearth’s crust was motionless in the region in question, for there may\r\nhave been a gradual sinking or rising, extending uniformly over a large\r\nsurface, and yet, during such movement, the stratified rocks may have\r\nretained their original horizontality of position. There may have been\r\na conversion of a wide area from sea into land and from land into sea,\r\nand during these changes of level some strata may have been slowly\r\nremoved by aqueous action, and after this new strata may be\r\nsuperimposed, differing perhaps in date by thousands of years or\r\ncenturies, and yet resting conformably on the older set. There may even\r\nbe a blending of the materials constituting the older deposit with\r\nthose of the newer, so as to give rise to a passage in the mineral\r\ncharacter of the one rock into the other as if there had been no break\r\nor interruption in the depositing process.\r\n\r\nImperfection of the Record.—Although by the frequent discovery of new\r\nsets of intermediate strata the transition from one type of organic\r\nremains to another is becoming less and less abrupt, yet the entire\r\nseries of records appears to the geologists now living far more\r\nfragmentary and defective than it seemed to their predecessors half a\r\ncentury ago. The earlier inquirers, as often as they encountered a\r\nbreak in the regular sequence of formations, connected it theoretically\r\nwith a sudden and violent catastrophe, which had put an end to the\r\nregular course of events that had been going on uninterruptedly for\r\nages, annihilating at the same time all or nearly all the organic\r\nbeings which had previously flourished, after which, order being\r\nre-established, a new series of events was initiated. In proportion as\r\nour faith in these views grows weaker, and the phenomena of the organic\r\nor inorganic world presented to us by geology seem explicable on the\r\nhypothesis of gradual and insensible changes, varied only by occasional\r\nconvulsions, on a scale comparable to that witnessed in historical\r\ntimes; and in proportion as it is thought possible that former\r\nfluctuations in the organic world may be due to the indefinite\r\nmodifiability of species without the necessity of assuming new and\r\nindependent acts of creation, the number and magnitude of the gaps\r\nwhich still remain, or the extreme imperfection of the record, become\r\nmore and more striking, and what we possess of the ancient annals of\r\nthe earth’s history appears as nothing when contrasted with that which\r\nhas been lost.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine a large area such as Europe, the average as well as the\r\nextreme height above the sea attained by the older formations is\r\nusually found to exceed that reached by the more modern ones, the\r\nprimary or palaeozoic rising higher than the secondary, and these in\r\ntheir turn than the tertiary; while in reference to the three divisions\r\nof the tertiary, the lowest or Eocene group attains a higher\r\nsummit-level than the Miocene, and these again a greater height than\r\nthe Pliocene formations. Lastly, the post-tertiary deposits, such, at\r\nleast, as are of marine origin, are most commonly restricted to much\r\nmore moderate elevations above the sea-level than the tertiary strata.\r\n\r\nIt is also observed that strata, in proportion as they are of newer\r\ndate, bear the nearest resemblance in mineral character to those which\r\nare now in the progress of formation in seas or lakes, the newest of\r\nall consisting principally of soft mud or loose sand, in some places\r\nfull of shells, corals, or other organic bodies, animal or vegetable,\r\nin others wholly devoid of such remains. The farther we recede from the\r\npresent time, and the higher the antiquity of the formations which we\r\nexamine, the greater are the changes which the sedimentary deposits\r\nhave undergone. Time, as I have explained in Chapters V, VI, and VII,\r\nhas multiplied the effects of condensation by pressure and cementation,\r\nand the modification produced by heat, fracture, contortion, upheaval,\r\nand denudation. The organic remains also have sometimes been\r\nobliterated entirely, or the mineral matter of which they were composed\r\nhas been removed and replaced by other substances.\r\n\r\nWhy newer Groups should be studied first.—We likewise observe that the\r\nolder the rocks the more widely do their organic remains depart from\r\nthe types of the living creation. First, we find in the newer tertiary\r\nrocks a few species which no longer exist, mixed with many living ones,\r\nand then, as we go farther back, many genera and families at present\r\nunknown make their appearance, until we come to strata in which the\r\nfossil relics of existing species are nowhere to be detected, except a\r\nfew of the lowest forms of invertebrate, while some orders of animals\r\nand plants wholly unrepresented in the living world begin to be\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nWhen we study, therefore, the geological records of the earth and its\r\ninhabitants, we find, as in human history, the defectiveness and\r\nobscurity of the monuments always increasing the remoter the era to\r\nwhich we refer, and the difficulty of determining the true\r\nchronological relations of rocks is more and more enhanced, especially\r\nwhen we are comparing those which were formed simultaneously in very\r\ndistant regions of the globe. Hence we advance with securer steps when\r\nwe begin with the study of the geological records of later times,\r\nproceeding from the newer to the older, or from the more to the less\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nIn thus inverting what might at first seem to be the more natural order\r\nof historical research, we must bear in mind that each of the periods\r\nabove enumerated, even the shortest, such as the Post-tertiary, or the\r\nPliocene, Miocene, or Eocene, embrace a succession of events of vast\r\nextent, so that to give a satisfactory account of what we already know\r\nof any one of them would require many volumes. When, therefore, we\r\napproach one of the newer groups before endeavouring to decipher the\r\nmonuments of an older one, it is like endeavouring to master the\r\nhistory of our own country and that of some contemporary nations,\r\nbefore we enter upon Roman History, or like investigating the annals of\r\nAncient Italy and Greece before we approach those of Egypt and Assyria.\r\n\r\nNomenclature.—The origin of the terms Primary and Secondary, and the\r\nsynonymous terms Palaeozoic, and Mesozoic, were explained in Chapter\r\nVIII, p. 123.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary or Cainozoic strata (see p. 123) were so called because\r\nthey were all posterior in date to the Secondary series, of which last\r\nthe Chalk of Cretaceous, No. 9, Fig. 86, constitutes the newest group.\r\nThe whole of them were at first confounded with the superficial\r\nalluviums of Europe; and it was long before their real extent and\r\nthickness, and the various ages to which they belong, were fully\r\nrecognised. They were observed to occur in patches, some of\r\nfresh-water, others of marine origin, their geographical area being\r\nusually small as compared to the secondary formations, and their\r\nposition often suggesting the idea of their having been deposited in\r\ndifferent bays, lakes, estuaries, or inland seas, after a large portion\r\nof the space now occupied by Europe had already been converted into dry\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe first deposits of this class, of which the characters were\r\naccurately determined, were those occurring in the neighbourhood of\r\nParis, described in 1810 by MM. Cuvier and Brongniart. They were\r\nascertained to consist of successive sets of strata, some of marine,\r\nothers of fresh-water origin, lying one upon the other. The fossil\r\nshells and corals were perceived to be almost all of unknown species,\r\nand to have in general a near affinity to those now inhabiting warmer\r\nseas. The bones and skeletons of land animals, some of them of large\r\nsize, and belonging to more than forty distinct species, were examined\r\nby Cuvier, and declared by him not to agree specifically, nor most of\r\nthem even generically, with any hitherto observed in the living\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nStrata were soon afterwards brought to light in the vicinity of London,\r\nand in Hampshire, which, although dissimilar in mineral composition,\r\nwere justly inferred by Mr. T. Webster to be of the same age as those\r\nof Paris, because the greater number of the fossil shells were\r\nspecifically identical. For the same reason, rocks found on the\r\nGironde, in the South of France, and at certain points in the North of\r\nItaly, were suspected to be of contemporaneous origin.\r\n\r\nAnother important discovery was soon afterwards made by Brocchi in\r\nItaly, who investigated the argillaceous and sandy deposits, replete\r\nwith shells, which form a low range of hills, flanking the Apennines on\r\nboth sides, from the plains of the Po to Calabria. These lower hills\r\nwere called by him the Subapennines, and were formed of strata chiefly\r\nmarine, and newer than those of Paris and London.\r\n\r\nAnother tertiary group occurring in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux and\r\nDax, in the South of France, was examined by M. de Basterot in 1825,\r\nwho described and figured several hundred species of shells, which\r\ndiffered for the most part both from the Parisian series and those of\r\nthe Subapennine hills. It was soon, therefore, suspected that this\r\nfauna might belong to a period intermediate between that of the\r\nParisian and Subapennine strata, and it was not long before the\r\nevidence of superposition was brought to bear in support of this\r\nopinion; for other strata, contemporaneous with those of Bordeaux, were\r\nobserved in one district (the Valley of the Loire), to overlie the\r\nParisian formation, and in another (in Piedmont) to underlie the\r\nSubapennine beds. The first example of these was pointed out in 1829 by\r\nM. Desnoyers, who ascertained that the sand and marl of marine origin\r\ncalled faluns, near Tours, in the basin of the Loire, full of\r\nsea-shells and corals, rested upon a lacustrine formation, which\r\nconstitutes the uppermost subdivision of the Parisian group, extending\r\ncontinuously throughout a great table-land intervening between the\r\nbasin of the Seine and that of the Loire. The other example occurs in\r\nItaly, where strata containing many fossils similar to those of\r\nBordeaux were observed by Bonelli and others in the environs of Turin,\r\nsubjacent to strata belonging to the Subapennine group of Brocchi.\r\n\r\nValue of Testacean Fossils in Classification.—It will be observed that\r\nin the foregoing allusions to organic remains, the testacea or the\r\nshell-bearing mollusca are selected as the most useful and convenient\r\nclass for the purposes of general classification. In the first place,\r\nthey are more universally distributed through strata of every age than\r\nany other organic bodies. Those families of fossils which are of rare\r\nand casual occurrence are absolutely of no avail in establishing a\r\nchronological arrangement. If we have plants alone in one group of\r\nstrata and the bones of mammalia in another, we can draw no conclusion\r\nrespecting the affinity or discordance of the organic beings of the two\r\nepochs compared; and the same may be said if we have plants and\r\nvertebrated animals in one series and only shells in another. Although\r\ncorals are more abundant, in a fossil state, than plants, reptiles, or\r\nfish, they are still rare when contrasted with shells, because they are\r\nmore dependent for their well-being on the constant clearness of the\r\nwater, and are, therefore, less likely to be included in rocks which\r\nendure in consequence of their thickness and the copiousness of\r\nsediment which prevailed when they originated. The utility of the\r\ntestacea is, moreover, enhanced by the circumstance that some forms are\r\nproper to the sea, others to the land, and others to fresh water.\r\nRivers scarcely ever fail to carry down into their deltas some\r\nland-shells, together with species which are at once fluviatile and\r\nlacustrine. By this means we learn what terrestrial, fresh-water, and\r\nmarine species coexisted at particular eras of the past: and having\r\nthus identified strata formed in seas with others which originated\r\ncontemporaneously in inland lakes, we are then enabled to advance a\r\nstep farther, and show that certain quadrupeds or aquatic plants, found\r\nfossil in lacustrine formations, inhabited the globe at the same period\r\nwhen certain fish, reptiles, and zoophytes lived in the ocean.\r\n\r\nAmong other characters of the molluscous animals, which render them\r\nextremely valuable in settling chronological questions in geology, may\r\nbe mentioned, first, the wide geographical range of many species; and,\r\nsecondly, what is probably a consequence of the former, the great\r\nduration of species in this class, for they appear to have surpassed in\r\nlongevity the greater number of the mammalia and fish. Had each species\r\ninhabited a very limited space, it could never, when imbedded in\r\nstrata, have enabled the geologist to identify deposits at distant\r\npoints; or had they each lasted but for a brief period, they could have\r\nthrown no light on the connection of rocks placed far from each other\r\nin the chronological, or, as it is often termed, vertical series.\r\n\r\nClassification of Tertiary Strata.—Many authors have divided the\r\nEuropean Tertiary strata into three groups—lower, middle, and upper;\r\nthe lower comprising the oldest formations of Paris and London before\r\nmentioned; the middle those of Bordeaux and Touraine; and the upper all\r\nthose newer than the middle group.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of the Principles of Geology, I divided the whole\r\nof the Tertiary formations into four groups, characterised by the\r\npercentage of recent shells which they contained. The lower tertiary\r\nstrata of London and Paris were thought by M. Deshayes to contain only\r\n3½ per cent of recent species, and were termed Eocene. The middle\r\ntertiary of the Loire and Gironde had, according to the specific\r\ndeterminations of the same conchologist, 17 per cent, and formed the\r\nMiocene division. The Subapennine beds contained 35 to 50 per cent, and\r\nwere termed Older Pliocene, while still more recent beds in Sicily,\r\nwhich had from 90 to 95 per cent of species identical with those now\r\nliving, were called Newer Pliocene. The first of the above terms,\r\nEocene, is derived from eos, _dawn_, and cainos, _recent_, because the\r\nfossil shells of this period contain an extremely small proportion of\r\nliving species, which may be looked upon as indicating the dawn of the\r\nexisting state of the testaceous fauna, no recent species having been\r\ndetected in the older or secondary rocks.\r\n\r\nThe term Miocene (from meion, _less_, and cainos, _recent_) is intended\r\nto express a minor proportion of recent species (of testacea), the term\r\nPliocene (from pleion, _ more_, and cainos, _recent_) a comparative\r\nplurality of the same. It may assist the memory of students to remind\r\nthem, that the _Mi_ocene contain a _mi_nor proportion, and _ Pl_iocene\r\na comparative _pl_urality of recent species; and that the greater\r\nnumber of recent species always implies the more modern origin of the\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been objected to this nomenclature that certain\r\nspecies of infusoria found in the chalk are still existing, and, on the\r\nother hand, the Miocene and Older Pliocene deposits often contain the\r\nremains of mammalia, reptiles, and fish, exclusively of extinct\r\nspecies. But the reader must bear in mind that the terms Eocene,\r\nMiocene, and Pliocene were originally invented with reference purely to\r\nconchological data, and in that sense have always been and are still\r\nused by me.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1830 the number of known shells, both recent and fossil,\r\nhas largely increased, and their identification has been more\r\naccurately determined. Hence some modifications have been required in\r\nthe classifications founded on less perfect materials. The Eocene,\r\nMiocene, and Pliocene periods have been made to comprehend certain sets\r\nof strata of which the fossils do not always conform strictly in the\r\nproportion of recent to extinct species with the definitions first\r\ngiven by me, or which are implied in the etymology of those terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nRECENT AND POST-PLIOCENE PERIODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent and Post-pliocene Periods. — Terms defined. — Formations of the\r\nRecent Period. — Modern littoral Deposits containing Works of Art near\r\nNaples. — Danish Peat and Shell-mounds. — Swiss Lake-dwellings. —\r\nPeriods of Stone, Bronze, and Iron. — Post-pliocene Formations. —\r\nCoexistence of Man with extinct Mammalia. — Reindeer Period of South of\r\nFrance. — Alluvial Deposits of Paleolithic Age. — Higher and\r\nLower-level Valley-gravels. — Loess or Inundation-mud of the Nile,\r\nRhine, etc. — Origin of Caverns. — Remains of Man and extinct\r\nQuadrupeds in Cavern Deposits. — Cave of Kirkdale. — Australian\r\nCave-breccias. — Geographical Relationship of the Provinces of living\r\nVertebrata and those of extinct Post-pliocene Species. — Extinct\r\nstruthious Birds of New Zealand. — Climate of the Post-pliocene Period.\r\n— Comparative Longevity of Species in the Mammalia and Testacea. —\r\nTeeth of Recent and Post-pliocene Mammalia.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last chapter that the uppermost or newest strata\r\nare called Post-tertiary, as being more modern than the Tertiary. It\r\nwill also be observed that the Post-tertiary formations are divided\r\ninto two subordinate groups: the Recent, and Post-pliocene. In the\r\nformer, or the Recent, the mammalia as well as the shells are identical\r\nwith species now living: whereas in the Post-pliocene, the shells being\r\nall of living forms, a part, and often a considerable part, of the\r\nmammalia belonged to extinct species. To this nomenclature it may be\r\nobjected that the term Post-pliocene should in strictness include all\r\ngeological monuments posterior in date to the Pliocene; but when I have\r\noccasion to speak of the whole collectively, I shall call them\r\nPost-tertiary, and reserve the term Post-pliocene for the older\r\nPost-tertiary formations, while the Upper or newer ones will be called\r\n“Recent.”\r\n\r\nCases will occur where it may be scarcely possible to draw the boundary\r\nline between the Recent and Post-pliocene deposits; and we must expect\r\nthese difficulties to increase rather than diminish with every advance\r\nin our knowledge, and in proportion as gaps are filled up in the series\r\nof records.\r\n\r\nRECENT PERIOD\r\n\r\nIt was stated in the sixth chapter, when I treated of denudation, that\r\nthe dry land, or that part of the earth’s surface which is not covered\r\nby the waters of lakes or seas, is generally wasting away by the\r\nincessant action of rain and rivers, and in some cases by the\r\nundermining and removing power of waves and tides on the sea-coast. But\r\nthe rate of waste is very unequal, since the level and gently sloping\r\nlands, where they are protected by a continuous covering of vegetation,\r\nescape nearly all wear and tear, so that they may remain for ages in a\r\nstationary condition, while the removal of matter is constantly\r\nwidening and deepening the intervening ravines and valleys.\r\n\r\nThe materials, both fine and coarse, carried down annually by rivers\r\nfrom the higher regions to the lower, and deposited in successive\r\nstrata in the basins of seas and lakes, must be of enormous volume. We\r\nare always liable to underrate their magnitude, because the\r\naccumulation of strata is going on out of sight.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, causes at work which, in the course of centuries,\r\ntend to render visible these modern formations, whether of marine or\r\nlacustrine origin. For a large portion of the earth’s crust is always\r\nundergoing a change of level, some areas rising and others sinking at\r\nthe rate of a few inches, or a few feet, perhaps sometimes yards, in a\r\ncentury; so that spaces which were once subaqueous are gradually\r\nconverted into land, and others which were high and dry become\r\nsubmerged. In consequence of such movements we find in certain regions,\r\nas in Cashmere, for example, where the mountains are often shaken by\r\nearthquakes, deposits which were formed in lakes in the historical\r\nperiod, but through which rivers have now cut deep and wide channels.\r\nIn lacustrine strata thus intersected, works of art and fresh-water\r\nshells are seen. In other districts on the borders of the sea, usually\r\nat very moderate elevations above its level, raised beaches occur, or\r\nmarine littoral deposits, such as those in which, on the borders of the\r\nBay of Baiæ, near Naples, the well-known temple of Serapis was\r\nimbedded. In that case the date of the monument buried in the marine\r\nstrata is ascertainable, but in many other instances the exact age of\r\nthe remains of human workmanship is uncertain, as in the estuary of the\r\nClyde at Glasgow, where many canoes have been exhumed, with other works\r\nof art, all assignable to some part of the Recent Period.\r\n\r\nDanish Peat and Shell-mounds or Kitchen-middens.—Sometimes we obtain\r\nevidence, without the aid of a change of level, of events which took\r\nplace in pre-historic times. The combined labours, for example, of the\r\nantiquary, zoologist, and botanist have brought to light many monuments\r\nof the early inhabitants buried in peat-mosses in Denmark. Their\r\ngeological age is determined by the fact that, not only the\r\ncontemporaneous fresh-water and land shells, but all the quadrupeds,\r\nfound in the peat, agree specifically with those now inhabiting the\r\nsame districts, or which are known to have been indigenous in Denmark\r\nwithin the memory of man. In the lower beds of peat (a deposit varying\r\nfrom 20 to 30 feet in thickness), weapons of stone accompany trunks of\r\nthe Scotch fir, _Pinus sylvestris._ This peat may be referred to that\r\npart of the stone period for which Sir John Lubbock proposed the name\r\nof “Neolithic”[1] in contradistinction to a still older era, termed by\r\nhim “Paleolithic,” and which will be described in the sequel. In the\r\nhigher portions of the same Danish bogs, bronze implements are\r\nassociated with trunks and acorns of the common oak. It appears that\r\nthe pine has never been a native of Denmark in historical times, and it\r\nseems to have given place to the oak about the time when articles and\r\ninstruments of bronze superseded those of stone. It also appears that,\r\nat a still later period, the oak itself became scarce, and was nearly\r\nsupplanted by the beech, a tree which now flourishes luxuriantly in\r\nDenmark. Again, at the still later epoch when the beech-tree abounded,\r\ntools of iron were introduced, and were gradually substituted for those\r\nof bronze.\r\n\r\nOn the coasts of the Danish islands in the Baltic, certain mounds,\r\ncalled in those countries “Kjökken-mödding,” or “kitchen-middens,”\r\noccur, consisting chiefly of the castaway shells of the oyster, cockle,\r\nperiwinkle, and other eatable kinds of molluscs. The mounds are from\r\nthree to ten feet high, and from 100 to 1000 feet in their longest\r\ndiameter. They greatly resemble heaps of shells formed by the Red\r\nIndians of North America along the eastern shores of the United States.\r\nIn the old refuse-heaps, recently studied by the Danish antiquaries and\r\nnaturalists with great skill and diligence, no implements of metal have\r\never been detected. All the knives, hatchets, and other tools, are of\r\nstone, horn, bone, or wood. With them are often intermixed fragments of\r\nrude pottery, charcoal and cinders, and the bones of quadrupeds on\r\nwhich the rude people fed. These bones belong to wild species still\r\nliving in Europe, though some of them, like the beaver, have long been\r\nextirpated in Denmark. The only animal which they seem to have\r\ndomesticated was the dog.\r\n\r\nAs there is an entire absence of metallic tools, these refuse-heaps are\r\nreferred to the Neolithic division of the age of stone, which\r\nimmediately preceded in Denmark the age of bronze. It appears that a\r\nrace more advanced in civilisation, armed with weapons of that mixed\r\nmetal, invaded Scandinavia, and ousted the aborigines.\r\n\r\nLacustrine Habitations of Switzerland.—In Switzerland a different class\r\nof monuments, illustrating the successive ages of stone, bronze, and\r\niron, has been of late years investigated with great success, and\r\nespecially since 1854, in which year Dr. F. Keller explored near the\r\nshore at Meilen, in the bottom of the lake of Zurich, the ruins of an\r\nold village, originally built on numerous wooden piles, driven, at some\r\nunknown period, into the muddy bed of the lake. Since then a great many\r\nother localities, more than a hundred and fifty in all, have been\r\ndetected of similar pile-dwellings, situated near the borders of the\r\nSwiss lakes, at points where the depth of water does not exceed 15\r\nfeet.[2] The superficial mud in such cases is filled with various\r\narticles, many hundreds of them being often dredged up from a very\r\nlimited area. Thousands of piles, decayed at their upper extremities,\r\nare often met with still firmly fixed in the mud.\r\n\r\nAs the ages of stone, bronze, and iron merely indicate successive\r\nstages of civilisation, they may all have coexisted at once in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe, and even in contiguous regions, among\r\nnations having little intercourse with each other. To make out,\r\ntherefore, a distinct chronological series of monuments is only\r\npossible when our observations are confined to a limited district, such\r\nas Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe relative antiquity of the pile-dwellings, which belong respectively\r\nto the ages of stone and bronze, is clearly illustrated by the\r\nassociations of the tools with certain groups of animal remains. Where\r\nthe tools are of stone, the castaway bones which served for the food of\r\nthe ancient people are those of deer, the wild boar, and wild ox, which\r\nabounded when society was in the hunter state. But the bones of the\r\nlater or bronze epoch were chiefly those of the domestic ox, goat, and\r\npig, indicating progress in civilisation. Some villages of the stone\r\nage are of later date than others, and exhibit signs of an improved\r\nstate of the arts. Among their relics are discovered carbonised grains\r\nof wheat and barley, and pieces of bread, proving that the cultivation\r\nof cereals had begun. In the same settlements, also, cloth, made of\r\nwoven flax and straw, has been detected.\r\n\r\nThe pottery of the bronze age in Switzerland is of a finer texture, and\r\nmore elegant in form, than that of the age of stone. At Nidau, on the\r\nlake of Bienne, articles of iron have also been discovered, so that\r\nthis settlement was evidently not abandoned till that metal had come\r\ninto use.\r\n\r\nAt La Thène, in the northern angle of the lake of Neufchâtel, a great\r\nmany articles of iron have been obtained, which in form and\r\nornamentation are entirely different both from those of the bronze\r\nperiod and from those used by the Romans. Gaulish and Celtic coins have\r\nalso been found there by MM. Schwab and Desor. They agree in character\r\nwith remains, including many iron swords, which have been found at\r\nTiefenau, near Berne, in ground supposed to have been a battle-field;\r\nand their date appears to have been anterior to the great Roman\r\ninvasion of Northern Europe, though perhaps not long before that\r\nevent.[3] Coins, which sometimes occur in deposits of the age of iron,\r\nhave never yet been found in formations of the ages of bronze or stone.\r\n\r\nThe period of bronze must have been one of foreign commerce, as tin,\r\nwhich enters into this metallic mixture in the proportion of about ten\r\nper cent to the copper, was obtained by the ancients chiefly from\r\nCornwall.[4] Very few human bones of the bronze period have been met\r\nwith in the Danish peat, or in the Swiss lake-dwellings, and this\r\nscarcity is generally attributed by archæologists to the custom of\r\nburning the dead, which prevailed in the age of bronze.\r\n\r\nPOST-PLIOCENE PERIOD\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing observations we may infer that the ages of iron and\r\nbronze in Northern and Central Europe were preceded by a stone age, the\r\nNeolithic, referable to that division of the post-tertiary epoch which\r\nI have called Recent, when the mammalia as well as the other organic\r\nremains accompanying the stone implements were of living species. But\r\nmemorials have of late been brought to light of a still older age of\r\nstone, for which, as above stated, the name Paleolithic has been\r\nproposed, when man was contemporary in Europe with the elephant and\r\nrhinoceros, and various other animals, of which many of the most\r\nconspicuous have long since died out.\r\n\r\nReindeer Period in South of France.—In the larger number of the caves\r\nof Europe, as for example in those of England, Belgium, Germany, and\r\nmany parts of France, the animal remains agree specifically with the\r\nfauna of this oldest division of the age of stone, or that to which\r\nbelongs the drift of Amiens and Abbeville presently to be mentioned,\r\ncontaining flint implements of a very antique type. But there are some\r\ncaves in the departments of Dordogne, Aude, and other parts of the\r\nsouth of France, which are believed by M. Lartet to be of intermediate\r\ndate between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. To this\r\nintermediate era M. Lartet gave, in 1863, the name of the “reindeer\r\nperiod,” because vast quantities of the bones and horns of that deer\r\nhave been met with in the French caverns. In some cases separate plates\r\nof molars of the mammoth, and several teeth of the great Irish deer,\r\n_Cervus megaceros,_ and of the cave-lion, _Felis spelæa,_ have been\r\nfound mixed up with cut and carved bones of reindeer. On one of these\r\nsculptured bones in the cave of Perigord, a rude representation of the\r\nmammoth, with its long curved tusks and covering of wool, occurs, which\r\nis regarded by M. Lartet as placing beyond all doubt the fact that the\r\nearly inhabitants of these caves must have seen this species of\r\nelephant still living in France. The presence of the marmot, as well as\r\nthe reindeer and some other northern animals, in these caverns seems to\r\nimply a colder climate than that of the Swiss lake-dwellings, in which\r\nno remains of reindeer have as yet been discovered. The absence of this\r\nlast in the old lacustrine habitations of Switzerland is the more\r\nsignificant, because in a cave in the neighbourhood of the lake of\r\nGeneva, namely, that of Mont Saleve, bones of the reindeer occur with\r\nflint implements similar to those of the caverns of Dordogne and\r\nPerigord.\r\n\r\nThe state of the arts, as exemplified by the instruments found in these\r\ncaverns of the reindeer period, is somewhat more advanced than that\r\nwhich characterises the tools of the Amiens drift, but is nevertheless\r\nmore rude than that of the Swiss lake-dwellings. No metallic articles\r\noccur, and the stone hatchets are not ground after the fashion of\r\ncelts; the needles of bone are shaped in a workmanlike style, having\r\ntheir eyes drilled with consummate skill.\r\n\r\nThe formations above alluded to, which are as yet but imperfectly\r\nknown, may be classed as belonging to the close of the Paleolithic era,\r\nof the monuments of which I am now about to treat.\r\n\r\nAlluvial Deposits of the Paleolithic Age.—The alluvial and marine\r\ndeposits of the Paleolithic age, the earliest to which any vestiges of\r\nman have yet been traced back, belong to a time when the physical\r\ngeography of Europe differed in a marked degree from that now\r\nprevailing. In the Neolithic period, the valleys and rivers coincided\r\nalmost entirely with those by which the present drainage of the land is\r\neffected, and the peat-mosses were the same as those now growing. The\r\nsituation of the shell-mounds and lake-dwellings above alluded to is\r\nsuch as to imply that the topography of the districts where they are\r\nobserved has not subsequently undergone any material alteration.\r\nWhereas we no sooner examine the Post-pliocene formations, in which the\r\nremains of so many extinct mammalia are found, than we at once perceive\r\na more decided discrepancy between the former and present outline of\r\nthe surface. Since those deposits originated, changes of considerable\r\nmagnitude have been effected in the depth and width of many valleys, as\r\nalso in the direction of the superficial and subterranean drainage,\r\nand, as is manifest near the sea-coast, in the relative position of\r\nland and water. In Fig. 87 an ideal section is given, illustrating the\r\ndifferent position which the Recent and Post-pliocene alluvial deposits\r\noccupy in many European valleys.\r\n\r\nFig. 87: Recent and Post-pliocene alluvial deposits.\r\n\r\nThe peat, No. 1, has been formed in a low part of the modern alluvial\r\nplain, in parts of which gravel No. 2 of the recent period is seen.\r\nOver this gravel the loam or fine sediment 2′ has in many places been\r\ndeposited by the river during floods which covered nearly the whole\r\nalluvial plain.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 represents an older alluvium, composed of sand and gravel, formed\r\nbefore the valley had been excavated to its present depth. It contains\r\nthe remains of fluviatile shells of living species associated with the\r\nbones of mammalia, in part of recent, and in part of extinct species.\r\nAmong the latter, the mammoth (_E. primigenius_) and the Siberian\r\nrhinoceros (_R. tichorhinus_) are the most common in Europe. No. 3′ is\r\na remnant of the loam or brick-earth by which No. 3 was overspread. No.\r\n4 is a still older and more elevated terrace, similar in its\r\ncomposition and organic remains to No. 3, and covered in like manner\r\nwith its inundation-mud, 4′. Sometimes the valley-gravels of older date\r\nare entirely missing, or there is only one, and occasionally there are\r\nmore than two, marking as many successive stages in the excavation of\r\nthe valley. They usually occur at heights varying from 10 to 100 feet,\r\nsometimes on the right and sometimes on the left side of the existing\r\nriver-plain, but rarely in great strength on exactly opposite sides of\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nAmong the genera of extinct quadrupeds most frequently met with in\r\nEngland, France, Germany, and other parts of Europe, are the elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, hippopotamus, horse, great Irish deer, bear, tiger, and\r\nhyæna. In the peat, No. 1 (Fig. 87), and in the more modern gravel and\r\nsilt (No. 2), works of art of the ages of iron and bronze, and of the\r\nlater or Neolithic stone period, already described, are met with. In\r\nthe more ancient or Paleolithic gravels, 3 and 4, there have been found\r\nof late years in several valleys in France and England—as, for example,\r\nin those of the Seine and Somme, and of the Thames and Ouse, near\r\nBedford—stone implements of a rude type, showing that man coexisted in\r\nthose districts with the mammoth and other extinct quadrupeds of the\r\ngenera above enumerated. In 1847, M. Boucher de Perthes observed in an\r\nancient alluvium at Abbeville, in Picardy, the bones of extinct\r\nmammalia associated in such a manner with flint implements of a rude\r\ntype as to lead him to infer that both the organic remains and the\r\nworks of art were referable to one and the same period. This inference\r\nwas soon after confirmed by Mr. Prestwich, who found in 1859 a flint\r\ntool in situ in the same stratum at Amiens that contained the remains\r\nof extinct mammalia.\r\n\r\nThe flint implements found at Abbeville and Amiens are most of them\r\nconsidered to be hatchets and spear-heads, and are different from those\r\ncommonly called “celts.” These celts, so often found in the recent\r\nformations, have a more regular oblong shape, the result of grinding,\r\nby which also a sharp edge has been given to them. The Abbeville tools\r\nfound in gravel at different levels, as in Nos. 3 and 4, Fig. 87, in\r\nwhich bones of the elephant, rhinoceros, and other extinct mammalia\r\noccur, are always unground, having evidently been brought into their\r\npresent form simply by the chipping off of fragments of flint by\r\nrepeated blows, such as could be given by a stone hammer.\r\n\r\nSome of them are oval, others of a spear-headed form, no two exactly\r\nalike, and yet the greater number of each kind are obviously fashioned\r\nafter the same general pattern. Their outer surface is often white, the\r\noriginal black flint having been discoloured and bleached by exposure\r\nto the air, or by the action of acids, as they lay in the gravel. They\r\nare most commonly stained of the same ochreous colour as the flints of\r\nthe gravel in which they are imbedded. Occasionally their antiquity is\r\nindicated not only by their colour but by superficial incrustations of\r\ncarbonate of lime, or by dendrites formed of oxide of iron and\r\nmanganese. The edges also of most of them are worn, sometimes by having\r\nbeen used as tools, or sometimes by having been rolled in the old\r\nriver’s bed. They are met with not only in the lower-level gravels, as\r\nin No. 3, Fig. 87, but also in No. 4, or the higher gravels, as at St.\r\nAcheul, in the suburbs of Amiens, where the old alluvium lies at an\r\nelevation of about 100 feet above the level of the river Somme. At both\r\nlevels fluviatile and land-shells are met with in the loam as well as\r\nin the gravel, but there are no marine shells associated, except at\r\nAbbeville, in the lowest part of the gravel, near the sea, and a few\r\nfeet only above the present high-water mark. Here with fossil shells of\r\nliving species are mingled the bones of _Elephas primigenius_ and _E.\r\nantiquus, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Hippopotamus, Felis spelæa, Hyæna\r\nspelæa,_ reindeer, and many others, the bones accompanying the flint\r\nimplements in such a manner as to show that both were buried in the old\r\nalluvium at the same period.\r\n\r\nNearly the entire skeleton of a rhinoceros was found at one point,\r\nnamely, in the Menchecourt drift at Abbeville, the bones being in such\r\njuxtaposition as to show that the cartilage must have held them\r\ntogether at the time of their inhumation.\r\n\r\nThe general absence here and elsewhere of human bones from gravel and\r\nsand in which flint tools are discovered, may in some degree be due to\r\nthe present limited extent of our researches. But it may also be\r\npresumed that when a hunter population, always scanty in numbers,\r\nranged over this region, they were too wary to allow themselves to be\r\novertaken by the floods which swept away many herbivorous animals from\r\nthe low river-plains where they may have been pasturing or sleeping.\r\nBeasts of prey prowling about the same alluvial flats in search of food\r\nmay also have been surprised more readily than the human tenant of the\r\nsame region, to whom the signs of a coming tempest were better known.\r\n\r\nInundation-mud of Rivers.—Brick-earth.—Fluviatile Loam, or Loess.—As a\r\ngeneral rule, the fluviatile alluvia of different ages (Nos. 2, 3, 4,\r\nFig. 87) are severally made up of coarse materials in their lower\r\nportions, and of fine silt or loam in their upper parts. For rivers are\r\nconstantly shifting their position in the valley-plain, encroaching\r\ngradually on one bank, near which there is deep water, and deserting\r\nthe other or opposite side, where the channel is growing shallower,\r\nbeing destined eventually to be converted into land. Where the current\r\nruns strongest, coarse gravel is swept along, and where its velocity is\r\nslackened, first sand, and then only the finest mud, is thrown down. A\r\nthin film of this fine sediment is spread, during floods, over a wide\r\narea, on one, or sometimes on both sides, of the main stream, often\r\nreaching as far as the base of the bluffs or higher grounds which bound\r\nthe valley. Of such a description are the well-known annual deposits of\r\nthe Nile, to which Egypt owes its fertility. So thin are they, that the\r\naggregate amount accumulated in a century is said rarely to exceed five\r\ninches, although in the course of thousands of years it has attained a\r\nvast thickness, the bottom not having been reached by borings extending\r\nto a depth of 60 feet towards the central parts of the valley.\r\nEverywhere it consists of the same homogeneous mud, destitute of\r\nstratification—the only signs of successive accumulation being where\r\nthe Nile has silted up its channel, or where the blown sands of the\r\nLibyan desert have invaded the plain, and give rise to alternate layers\r\nof sand and mud.\r\n\r\nIn European river-loams we occasionally observe isolated pebbles and\r\nangular pieces of stone which have been floated by ice to the places\r\nwhere they now occur; but no such coarse materials are met with in the\r\nplains of Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the valley of the Rhine the accumulation of similar\r\nloam, called in Germany “loess,” has taken place on an enormous scale.\r\nIts colour is yellowish-grey, and very homogeneous; and Professor\r\nBischoff has ascertained, by analysis, that it agrees in composition\r\nwith the mud of the Nile. Although for the most part unstratified, it\r\nbetrays in some places marks of stratification, especially where it\r\ncontains calcareous concretions, or in its lower part where it rests on\r\nsubjacent gravel and sand which alternate with each other near the\r\njunction. About a sixth part of the whole mass is composed of carbonate\r\nof lime, and there is usually an intermixture of fine quartzose and\r\nmicaceous sand.\r\n\r\nAlthough this loam of the Rhine is unsolidified, it usually terminates\r\nwhere it has been undermined by running water in a vertical cliff, from\r\nthe face of which shells of terrestrial, fresh-water and amphibious\r\nmollusks project in relief. These shells do not imply the permanent\r\nsojourn of a body of fresh water on the spot, for the most aquatic of\r\nthem, the _Succinea_, inhabits marshes and wet grassy meadows. The\r\n_Succinea elongata_ (or _S. oblongata_), Fig. 88, is very\r\ncharacteristic both of the loess of the Rhine and of some other\r\nEuropean river-loams.\r\n\r\nFig. 88: Succinea elongata; Fig. 89: Pupa muscorum (Linn.); Fig. 90:\r\nHelix hispida (Linn.) (plebia).\r\n\r\nAmong the land-shells of the Rhenish loess, _Helix hispida_, Fig. 90,\r\nand _Pupa muscorum_, Fig. 89, are very common. Both the terrestrial and\r\naquatic shells are of most fragile and delicate structure, and yet they\r\nare almost invariably perfect and uninjured. They must have been broken\r\nto pieces had they been swept along by a violent inundation. Even the\r\ncolour of some of the land-shells, as that of _Helix nemoralis_, is\r\noccasionally preserved.\r\n\r\nIn parts of the valley of the Rhine, between Bingen and Basle, the\r\nfluviatile loam or loess now under consideration is several hundred\r\nfeet thick, and contains here and there throughout that thickness land\r\nand amphibious shells. As it is seen in masses fringing both sides of\r\nthe great plain, and as occasionally remnants of it occur in the centre\r\nof the valley, forming hills several hundred feet in height, it seems\r\nnecessary to suppose, first, a time when it slowly accumulated; and\r\nsecondly, a later period, when large portions of it were removed, or\r\nwhen the original valley, which had been partially filled up with it,\r\nwas re-excavated.\r\n\r\nSuch changes may have been brought about by a great movement of\r\noscillation, consisting first of a general depression of the land, and\r\nthen of a gradual re-elevation of the same. The amount of continental\r\ndepression which first took place in the interior, must be imagined to\r\nhave exceeded that of the region near the sea, in which case the higher\r\npart of the great valley would have its alluvial plain gradually raised\r\nby an accumulation of sediment, which would only cease when the\r\nsubsidence of the land was at an end. If the direction of the movement\r\nwas then reversed, and, during the re-elevation of the continent, the\r\ninland region nearest the mountains should rise more rapidly than that\r\nnear the coast, the river would acquire a denuding power sufficient to\r\nenable it to sweep away gradually nearly all the loam and gravel with\r\nwhich parts of its basin had been filled up. Terraces and hillocks of\r\nmud and sand would then alone remain to attest the various levels at\r\nwhich the river had thrown down and afterwards removed alluvial matter.\r\n\r\nCavern Deposits containing Human Remains and Bones of Extinct\r\nAnimals.—In England, and in almost all countries where limestone rocks\r\nabound, caverns are found, usually consisting of cavities of large\r\ndimensions, connected together by low, narrow, and sometimes torturous\r\ngalleries or tunnels. These subterranean vaults are usually filled in\r\npart with mud, pebbles, and breccia, in which bones occur belonging to\r\nthe same assemblage of animals as those characterising the\r\nPost-pliocene alluvia above described. Some of these bones are\r\nreferable to extinct and others to living species, and they are\r\noccasionally intermingled, as in the valley-gravels, with implements of\r\none or other of the great divisions of the stone age, and these are not\r\nunfrequently accompanied by human bones, which are much more common in\r\ncavern deposits than in valley-alluvium.\r\n\r\nEach suite of caverns, and the passages by which they communicate the\r\none with the other, afford memorials to the geologist of successive\r\nphases through which they must have passed. First, there was a period\r\nwhen the carbonate of lime was carried out gradually by springs;\r\nsecondly, an era when engulfed rivers or occasional floods swept\r\norganic and inorganic debris into the subterranean hollows previously\r\nformed; and thirdly, there were such changes in the configuration of\r\nthe region as caused the engulfed rivers to be turned into new\r\nchannels, and springs to be dried up, after which the cave-mud,\r\nbreccia, gravel, and fossil bones would bear the same kind of relation\r\nto the existing drainage of the country as the older valley-drifts with\r\ntheir extinct mammalian remains and works of art bear to the present\r\nrivers and alluvial plains.\r\n\r\nThe quarrying away of large masses of Carboniferous and Devonian\r\nlimestone, near Liege, in Belgium, has afforded the geologist\r\nmagnificent sections of some of these caverns, and the former\r\ncommunication of cavities in the interior of the rocks with the old\r\nsurface of the country by means of vertical or oblique fissures, has\r\nbeen demonstrated in places where it would not otherwise have been\r\nsuspected, so completely have the upper extremities of these fissures\r\nbeen concealed by superficial drift, while their lower ends, which\r\nextended into the roofs of the caves, are masked by stalactitic\r\nincrustations.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the stalactite is thus explained by the eminent chemist\r\nLiebig. Mould or humus, being acted on by moisture and air, evolves\r\ncarbonic acid, which is dissolved by rain. The rain-water, thus\r\nimpregnated, permeates the porous limestone, dissolves a portion of it,\r\nand afterwards, when the excess of carbonic acid evaporates in the\r\ncaverns, parts with the calcareous matter, and forms stalactite. Even\r\nwhile caverns are still liable to be occasionally flooded such\r\ncalcareous incrustations accumulate, but it is generally when they are\r\nno longer in the line of drainage that a solid floor of hard stalagmite\r\nis formed on the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Schmerling examined forty caves near Liege, and found in\r\nall of them the remains of the same fauna, comprising the mammoth,\r\ntichorhine rhinoceros, cave-bear, cave-hyæna, cave-lion, and many\r\nothers, some of extinct and some of living species, and in all of them\r\nflint implements. In four or five caves only parts of human skeletons\r\nwere met with, comprising sometimes skulls with a few other bones,\r\nsometimes nearly every part of the skeleton except the skull. In one of\r\nthe caves, that of Engihoul, where Schmerling had found the remains of\r\nat least three human individuals, they were mingled in such a manner\r\nwith bones of extinct mammalia, as to leave no doubt on his mind (in\r\n1833) of man having co-existed with them.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Professor Malaise, of Liege, explored with me this same cave\r\nof Engihoul, and beneath a hard floor of stalagmite we found mud full\r\nof bones of extinct and recent animals, such as Schmerling had\r\ndescribed, and my companion, persevering in his researches after I had\r\nreturned to England, extracted from the same deposit two human lower\r\njaw-bones retaining their teeth. The skulls from these Belgian caverns\r\ndisplay no marked deviation from the normal European type of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe careful investigations carried on by Dr. Falconer, Mr. Pengelly,\r\nand others, in the Brixham cave near Torquay, in 1858, demonstrated\r\nthat flint knives were there imbedded in such a manner in loam\r\nunderlying a floor of stalagmite as to prove that man had been an\r\ninhabitant of that region when the cave-bear and other members of the\r\nancient post-pliocene fauna were also in existence.\r\n\r\nThe absence of gnawed bones had led Dr. Schmerling to infer that none\r\nof the Belgian caves which he explored had served as the dens of wild\r\nbeasts; but there are many caves in Germany and England which have\r\ncertainly been so inhabited, especially by the extinct hyæna and bear.\r\n\r\nA fine example of a hyæna’s den was afforded by the cave of Kirkdale,\r\nso well described by the late Dr. Buckland in his _Reliquiæ Diluvianæ._\r\nIn that cave, above twenty-five miles north-north-east of York, the\r\nremains of about 300 hyænas, belonging to individuals of every age,\r\nwere detected. The species (_Hyæna spelæa_) has been considered by\r\npalæontologists as extinct; it was larger than the fierce _Hyæna\r\ncrocuta_ of South Africa, which it closely resembled, and of which it\r\nis regarded by Mr. Boyd Dawkins as a variety. Dr. Buckland, after\r\ncarefully examining the spot, proved that the hyænas must have lived\r\nthere; a fact attested by the quantity of their dung, which, as in the\r\ncase of the living hyæna, is of nearly the same composition as bone,\r\nand almost as durable. In the cave were found the remains of the ox,\r\nyoung elephant, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, horse, bear, wolf, hare,\r\nwater-rat, and several birds. All the bones have the appearance of\r\nhaving been broken and gnawed by the teeth of the hyænas; and they\r\noccur confusedly mixed in loam or mud, or dispersed through a crust of\r\nstalagmite which covers it. In these and many other cases it is\r\nsupposed that portions of herbivorous quadrupeds have been dragged into\r\ncaverns by beasts of prey, and have served as their food—an opinion\r\nquite consistent with the known habits of the living hyæna.\r\n\r\n_Australian Cave-breccias._—Ossiferous breccias are not confined to\r\nEurope, but occur in all parts of the globe; and those discovered in\r\nfissures and caverns in Australia correspond closely in character with\r\nwhat has been called the bony breccia of the Mediterranean, in which\r\nthe fragments of bone and rock are firmly bound together by a red\r\nochreous cement.\r\n\r\nFig. 91: Part of a lower jaw of Macropus atlas.\r\n\r\nSome of these caves were examined by the late Sir T. Mitchell in the\r\nWellington Valley, about 210 miles west of Sidney, on the river Bell,\r\none of the principal sources of the Macquarie, and on the Macquarie\r\nitself. The caverns often branch off in different directions through\r\nthe rock, widening and contracting their dimensions, and the roofs and\r\nfloors are covered with stalactite. The bones are often broken, but do\r\nnot seem to be water-worn. In some places they lie imbedded in loose\r\nearth, but they are usually included in a breccia.\r\n\r\nThe remains belong to marsupial animals. Among the most abundant are\r\nthose of the kangaroo, of which there are four species, while others\r\nbelong to the genera _Phascolomys_, the wombat; _Dasyurus_), the ursine\r\nopossum; _Phalangista_, the vulpine opossum; and _Hypsiprymnus_, the\r\nkangaroo-rat.\r\n\r\nFig. 92: Lower jaw of largest living species of kangaroo.\r\n\r\nIn the fossils above enumerated, several species are larger than the\r\nlargest living ones of the same genera now known in Australia. Fig. 91\r\nof the right side of a lower jaw of a kangaroo (_Macropus atlas_, Owen)\r\nwill at once be seen to exceed in magnitude the corresponding part of\r\nthe largest living kangaroo, which is represented in Fig. 92. In both\r\nthese specimens part of the substance of the jaw has been broken open,\r\nso as to show the permanent false molar (_a_, Fig. 91), concealed in\r\nthe socket. From the fact of this molar not having been cut, we learn\r\nthat the individual was young, and had not shed its first teeth.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that all these extinct quadrupeds of Australia\r\nbelong to the marsupial family, or, in other words, that they are\r\nreferable to the same peculiar type of organisation which now\r\ndistinguishes the Australian mammalia from those of other parts of the\r\nglobe. This fact is one of many pointing to a general law deducible\r\nfrom the fossil vertebrate and invertebrate animals of times\r\nimmediately antecedent to our own, namely, that the present\r\ngeographical distribution of organic _forms_ dates back to a period\r\nanterior to the origin of existing _species_; in other words, the\r\nlimitation of particular genera or families of quadrupeds, mollusca,\r\netc., to certain existing provinces of land and sea, began before the\r\nlarger part of the species now contemporary with man had been\r\nintroduced into the earth.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen, in his excellent “History of British Fossil Mammals,”\r\nhas called attention to this law, remarking that the fossil quadrupeds\r\nof Europe and Asia differ from those of Australia or South America. We\r\ndo not find, for example, in the Europæo-Asiatic province fossil\r\nkangaroos, or armadillos, but the elephant, rhinoceros, horse, bear,\r\nhyæna, beaver, hare, mole, and others, which still characterise the\r\nsame continent.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, in the Pampas of South America the skeletons of\r\nMegatherium, Megalonyx, Glyptodon, Mylodon, Toxodon, Macrauchenia, and\r\nother extinct forms, are analogous to the living sloth, armadillo,\r\ncavy, capybara, and llama. The fossil quadrumana, also associated with\r\nsome of these forms in the Brazilian caves, belong to the Platyrrhine\r\nfamily of monkeys, now peculiar to South America. That the extinct\r\nfauna of Buenos Ayres and Brazil was very modern has been shown by its\r\nrelation to deposits of marine shells, agreeing with those now\r\ninhabiting the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe law of geographical relationship above alluded to, between the\r\nliving vertebrata of every great zoological province and the fossils of\r\nthe period immediately antecedent, even where the fossil species are\r\nextinct, is by no means confined to the mammalia. New Zealand, when\r\nfirst examined by Europeans, was found to contain no indigenous land\r\nquadrupeds, no kangaroos, or opossums, like Australia; but a wingless\r\nbird abounded there, the smallest living representative of the ostrich\r\nfamily, called the Kiwi by the natives (_Apteryx_). In the fossils of\r\nthe Post-pliocene period in this same island, there is the like absence\r\nof kangaroos, opossums, wombats, and the rest; but in their place a\r\nprodigious number of well-preserved specimens of gigantic birds of the\r\nstruthious order, called by Owen _Dinornis_ and _Palapteryx_, which are\r\nentombed in superficial deposits. These genera comprehended many\r\nspecies, some of which were four, some seven, others nine, and others\r\neleven feet in height! It seems doubtful whether any contemporary\r\nmammalia shared the land with this population of gigantic feathered\r\nbipeds.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, when describing the recent and fossil mammalia of South\r\nAmerica, has dwelt much on the wonderful relationship of the extinct to\r\nthe living types in that part of the world, inferring from such\r\ngeographical phenomena that the existing species are all related to the\r\nextinct ones which preceded them by a bond of common descent.\r\n\r\nClimate of the Post-pliocene Period.—The evidence as to the climate of\r\nEurope during this epoch is somewhat conflicting. The fluviatile and\r\nland-shells are all of existing species, but their geographical range\r\nhas not always been the same as at present. Some, for example, which\r\nthen lived in Britain are now only found in Norway and Finland,\r\nprobably implying that the Post-pliocene climate of Britain was colder,\r\nespecially in the winter. So also the reindeer and the musk-ox (_Ovibos\r\nmoschatus_), now inhabitants of the Arctic regions, occur fossil in the\r\nvalleys of the Thames and Avon, and also in France and Germany,\r\naccompanied in most places by the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros. At\r\nGrays in Essex, on the other hand, another species both of elephant and\r\nrhinoceros occurs, together with a hippopotamus and the _Cyrena\r\nfluminalis_, a shell now extinct in Europe but still an inhabitant of\r\nthe Nile and some Asiatic rivers. With it occurs the _Unio littoralis_,\r\nnow living in the Seine and Loire. In the valley of the Somme flint\r\ntools have been found associated with _Hippopotamus major_ and _Cyrena\r\nfluminalis_ in the lower-level Post-pliocene gravels; while in the\r\nhigher-level (and more ancient) gravels similar tools are more\r\nabundant, and are associated with the bones of the mammoth and other\r\nPost-pliocene quadrupeds indicative of a colder climate.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that we may here have evidence of summer and winter\r\nmigrations rather than of a general change of temperature. Instead of\r\nimagining that the hippopotamus lived all the year round with the\r\nmusk-ox and lemming, we may rather suppose that the apparently\r\nconflicting evidence may be due to the place of our observations being\r\nnear the boundary line of a northern and southern fauna, either of\r\nwhich may have advanced or receded during comparatively slight and\r\ntemporary fluctuations of climate. There may then have been a\r\ncontinuous land communication between England and the North of Siberia,\r\nas well as in an opposite direction with Africa, then united to\r\nSouthern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn drift at Fisherton, near Salisbury, thirty feet above the river\r\nWiley, the Greenland lemming and a new species of the Arctic genus\r\n_Spermophilus_ have been found, along with the mammoth, reindeer,\r\ncave-hyæna, and other mammalia suited to a cold climate. A flint\r\nimplement was taken out from beneath the bones of the mammoth. In a\r\nhigher and older deposit in the vicinity, flint tools like those of\r\nAmiens have been discovered. Nearly all the known Post-pliocene\r\nquadrupeds have now been found accompanying flint knives or hatchets in\r\nsuch a way as to imply their coexistence with man; and we have thus the\r\nconcurrent testimony of several classes of geological facts to the vast\r\nantiquity of the human race. In the first place, the disappearance of a\r\ngreat variety of species of wild animals from every part of a wide\r\ncontinent must have required a vast period for its accomplishment; yet\r\nthis took place while man existed upon the earth, and was completed\r\nbefore that early period when the Danish shell-mounds were formed or\r\nthe oldest of the Swiss lake-dwellings constructed. Secondly, the\r\ndeepening and widening of valleys, indicated by the position of the\r\nriver gravels at various heights, implies an amount of change of which\r\nthat which has occurred during the historical period forms a scarcely\r\nperceptible part. Thirdly, the change in the course of rivers which\r\nonce flowed through caves now removed from any line of drainage, and\r\nthe formation of solid floors of stalagmite, must have required a great\r\nlapse of time. Lastly, ages must have been required to change the\r\nclimate of wide regions to such an extent as completely to alter the\r\ngeographical distribution of many mammalia as well as land and\r\nfresh-water shells. The 3000 or 4000 years of the historical period\r\ndoes not furnish us with any appreciable measure for calculating the\r\nnumber of centuries which would suffice for such a series of changes,\r\nwhich are by no means of a local character, but have operated over a\r\nconsiderable part of Europe.\r\n\r\nRelative Longevity of Species in the Mammalia and Testacea.—I called\r\nattention in 1830[5] to the fact, which had not at that time attracted\r\nnotice, that the association in the Post-pliocene deposits of shells,\r\nexclusively of living species, with many extinct quadrupeds betokened a\r\nlongevity of species in the testacea far exceeding that in the\r\nmammalia. Subsequent researches seem to show that this greater duration\r\nof the same specific forms in the class mollusca is dependent on a\r\nstill more general law, namely, that the lower the grade of animals, or\r\nthe greater the simplicity of their structure, the more persistent are\r\nthey in general in their specific characters throughout vast periods of\r\ntime. Not only have the invertebrata, as shown by geological data,\r\naltered at a less rapid rate than the vertebrata, but if we take one of\r\nthe classes of the former, as for example the mollusca, we find those\r\nof more simple structure to have varied at a slower rate than those of\r\na higher and more complex organisation; the Brachiopoda, for example,\r\nmore slowly than the lamellibranchiate bivalves, while the latter have\r\nbeen more persistent than the univalves, whether gasteropoda or\r\ncephalopoda. In like manner the specific identity of the characters of\r\nthe foraminifera, which are among the lowest types of the invertebrata,\r\nhas outlasted that of the mollusca in an equally decided manner.\r\n\r\nTeeth of Post-pliocene Mammalia.—To those who have never studied\r\ncomparative anatomy, it may seem scarcely credible that a single bone\r\ntaken from any part of the skeleton may enable a skilful osteologist to\r\ndistinguish, in many cases, the genus, and sometimes the species, of\r\nquadrupeds to which it belonged. Although few geologists can aspire to\r\nsuch knowledge, which must be the result of long practice and study,\r\nthey will nevertheless derive great advantage from learning, what is\r\ncomparatively an easy task, to distinguish the principal divisions of\r\nthe mammalia by the forms and characters of their teeth.\r\n\r\nFig. 93: Elephas primigenius (or Mammoth) molar of upper jaw, right\r\nside.

The peculiarity of its form in Europe north\r\nof the 50th, and in North America north of the 40th parallel of\r\nlatitude, is now universally attributed to the action of ice, and the\r\ndifference of opinion respecting it is now chiefly restricted to the\r\nquestion whether land-ice or floating icebergs have played the chief\r\npart in its distribution. It is wanting in the warmer and equatorial\r\nregions, and reappears when we examine the lands which lie south of the\r\n40th and 50th parallels in the southern hemisphere, as, for example, in\r\nPatagonia, Tierra del Fuego, and New Zealand. It consists of sand and\r\nclay, sometimes stratified, but often wholly devoid of stratification\r\nfor a depth of 50, 100, or even a greater number of feet. To this\r\nunstratified form of the deposit the name of _till_ has long been\r\napplied in Scotland. It generally contains a mixture of angular and\r\nrounded fragments of rock, some of large size, having occasionally one\r\nor more of their sides flattened and smoothed, or even highly polished.\r\nThe smoothed surfaces usually exhibit many scratches parallel to each\r\nother, one set of which often crosses an older set. The till is almost\r\neverywhere wholly devoid of organic remains, except those washed into\r\nit from older formations, though in some places it contains marine\r\nshells, usually of northern or Arctic species, and frequently in a\r\nfragmentary state. The bulk of the till has usually been derived from\r\nthe grinding down into mud of rocks in the immediate neighbourhood, so\r\nthat it is red in a region of Red Sandstone, as in Strathmore in\r\nForfarshire; grey or black in a district of coal and bituminous shale,\r\nas around Edinburgh; and white in a chalk country, as in parts of\r\nNorfolk and Denmark. The stony fragments dispersed irregularly through\r\nthe till usually belong, especially in mountainous countries, to rocks\r\nfound in some part of the same hydrographical basin; but there are\r\nregions where the whole of the boulder clay has come from a distance,\r\nand huge blocks, or “erratics,” as they have been called, many feet in\r\ndiameter, have not unfrequently travelled hundreds of miles from their\r\npoint of departure, or from the parent rocks from which they have\r\nevidently been detached. These are commonly angular, and have often one\r\nor more of their sides polished and furrowed.\r\n\r\nThe rock on which the boulder formation reposes, if it consists of\r\ngranite, gneiss, marble, or other hard stone, capable of permanently\r\nretaining any superficial markings which may have been imprinted upon\r\nit, is usually smoothed or polished, like the erratics above described,\r\nand exhibits parallel striæ and furrows having a determinate direction.\r\nThis direction, both in Europe and North America, agrees generally in a\r\nmarked manner with the course taken by the erratic blocks in the same\r\ndistrict. The boulder clay, when it was first studied, seemed in many\r\nof its characters so singular and anomalous, that geologists despaired\r\nof ever being able to interpret the phenomena by reference to causes\r\nnow in action. In those exceptional cases where marine shells of the\r\nsame date as the boulder clay were found, nearly all of them were\r\nrecognised as living species—a fact conspiring with the superficial\r\nposition of the drift to indicate a comparatively modern origin.\r\n\r\nThe term “diluvium” was for a time the most popular name of the boulder\r\nformation, because it was referred by many to the deluge of Noah, while\r\nothers retained the name as expressive of their opinion that a series\r\nof diluvial waves raised by hurricanes and storms, or by earthquakes,\r\nor by the sudden upheaval of land from the bed of the sea, had swept\r\nover the continents, carrying with them vast masses of mud and heavy\r\nstones, and forcing these stones over rocky surfaces so as to polish\r\nand imprint upon them long furrows and striæ. But geologists were not\r\nlong in seeing that the boulder formation was characteristic of high\r\nlatitudes, and that on the whole the size and number of erratic blocks\r\nincreases as we travel towards the Arctic regions. They could not fail\r\nto be struck with the contrast which the countries bordering the Baltic\r\npresented when compared with those surrounding the Mediterranean. The\r\nmultitude of travelled blocks and striated rocks in the one region, and\r\nthe absence of such appearances in the other, were too obvious to be\r\noverlooked. Even the great development of the boulder formation, with\r\nlarge erratics so far south as the Alps, offered an exception to the\r\ngeneral rule favourable to the hypothesis that there was some intimate\r\nconnection between it and accumulations of snow and ice.\r\n\r\nFig. 106: Limestone, polished, furrowed, and scratched by the glacier\r\nof Rosenlau in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nTransporting and abrading Power of Glaciers.—I have described elsewhere\r\n(“Principles” vol. i, chap. xvi, 1867) the manner in which the snow of\r\nthe Alpine heights is prevented from accumulating indefinitely in\r\nthickness by the constant descent of a large portion of it by\r\ngravitation. Becoming converted into ice it forms what are termed\r\nglaciers, which glide down the principal valleys. On their surface are\r\nseen mounds of rubbish or large heaps of sand and mud, with angular\r\nfragments of rock which fall from the steep slopes or precipices\r\nbounding the glaciers. When a glacier, thus laden, descends so far as\r\nto reach a region about 3500 feet above the level of the sea, the\r\nwarmth of the air is such that it melts rapidly in summer, and all the\r\nmud, sand, and pieces of rock are slowly deposited at its lower end,\r\nforming a confused heap of unstratified rubbish called a _moraine_, and\r\nresembling the _till_ before described (p. 166).\r\n\r\nBesides the blocks thus carried down on the top of the glacier, many\r\nfall through fissures in the ice to the bottom, where some of them\r\nbecome firmly frozen into the mass, and are pushed along the base of\r\nthe glacier, abrading, polishing, and grooving the rocky floor below,\r\nas a diamond cuts glass, or as emery-powder polishes steel. The striæ\r\nwhich are made, and the deep grooves which are scooped out by this\r\naction, are rectilinear and parallel to an extent never seen in those\r\nproduced on loose stones or rocks, where shingle is hurried along by a\r\ntorrent, or by the waves on a sea-beach. In addition to these polished,\r\nstriated, and grooved surfaces of rock, another mark of the former\r\naction of a glacier is the “roche moutonnee.” Projecting eminences of\r\nrock so called have been smoothed and worn into the shape of flattened\r\ndomes by the glacier as it passed over them. They have been traced in\r\nthe Alps to great heights above the present glaciers, and to great\r\nhorizontal distances beyond them.\r\n\r\nAlpine Blocks on the Jura.—The moraines, erratics, polished surfaces,\r\ndomes, and striæ, above described, are observed in the great valley of\r\nSwitzerland, fifty miles broad; and almost everywhere on the Jura, a\r\nchain which lies to the north of this valley. The average height of the\r\nJura is about one-third that of the Alps, and it is now entirely\r\ndestitute of glaciers; yet it presents almost everywhere similar\r\nmoraines, and the same polished and grooved surfaces. The erratics,\r\nmoreover, which cover it, present a phenomenon which has astonished and\r\nperplexed the geologist for more than half a century. No conclusion can\r\nbe more incontestable than that these angular blocks of granite,\r\ngneiss, and other crystalline formations came from the Alps, and that\r\nthey have been brought for a distance of fifty miles and upward across\r\none of the widest and deepest valleys in the world; so that they are\r\nnow lodged on a chain composed of limestone and other formations,\r\naltogether distinct from those of the Alps. Their great size and\r\nangularity, after a journey of so many leagues, has justly excited\r\nwonder; for hundreds of them are as large as cottages; and one in\r\nparticular, composed of gneiss, celebrated under the name of Pierre à\r\nBot, rests on the side of a hill about 900 feet above the lake of\r\nNeufchâtel, and is no less than 40 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1821, M. Venetz first announced his opinion that the Alpine\r\nglaciers must formerly have extended far beyond their present limits,\r\nand the proofs appealed to by him in confirmation of this doctrine were\r\nacknowledged by all subsequent observers, and greatly strengthened by\r\nnew observations and arguments. M. Charpentier supposed that when the\r\nglaciers extended continuously from the Alps to the Jura, the former\r\nmountains were 2000 or 3000 feet higher than at present. Other writers,\r\non the contrary, conjectured that the whole country had been submerged,\r\nand the moraines and erratic blocks transported on floating icebergs;\r\nbut a careful study of the distribution of the travelled masses, and\r\nthe total absence of marine shells from the old glacial drift of\r\nSwitzerland, have entirely disproved this last hypothesis. In addition\r\nto the many evidences of the action of ice in the northern parts of\r\nEurope which we have already mentioned, there occur here and there in\r\nsome of these countries, what are wanting in Switzerland, deposits of\r\nmarine fossil shells, which exhibit so arctic a character that they\r\nmust have led the geologist to infer the former prevalence of a much\r\ncolder climate, even had he not encountered so many accompanying signs\r\nof ice-action. The same marine shells demonstrate the submergence of\r\nlarge areas in Scandinavia and the British Isles, during the glacial\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of the deposits under consideration in all\r\nthese countries is the occurrence of large erratic blocks, and\r\nsometimes of moraine matter, in situations remote from lofty mountains,\r\nand separated from the nearest points where the parent rocks appear at\r\nthe surface by great intervening valleys, or arms of the sea. We also\r\noften observe striæ and furrows, as in Norway, Sweden, and Scotland,\r\nwhich deviate from the direction which they ought to follow if they had\r\nbeen connected with the present line of drainage, and they, therefore,\r\nimply the prevalence of a very distinct condition of things at the time\r\nwhen the cold was most intense. The actual state of North Greenland\r\nseems to afford the best explanation of such abnormal glacial markings.\r\n\r\nGreenland Continental Ice.—Greenland is a vast unexplored continent,\r\nburied under one continuous and colossal mass of ice that is always\r\nmoving seaward, a very small part of it in an easterly direction, and\r\nall the rest westward, or towards Baffin’s Bay. All the minor ridges\r\nand valleys are levelled and concealed under a general covering of\r\nsnow, but here and there some steep mountains protrude abruptly from\r\nthe icy slope, and a few superficial lines of stones or moraines are\r\nvisible at certain seasons, when no snow has fallen for many months,\r\nand when evaporation, promoted by the wind and sun, has caused much of\r\nthe upper snow to disappear. The height of this continent is unknown,\r\nbut it must be very great, as the most elevated lands of the outskirts,\r\nwhich are described as comparatively low, attain altitudes of 4000 to\r\n6000 feet. The icy slope gradually lowers itself towards the outskirts,\r\nand then terminates abruptly in a mass about 2000 feet in thickness,\r\nthe great discharge of ice taking place through certain large friths,\r\nwhich, at their upper ends, are usually about four miles across. Down\r\nthese friths the ice is protruded in huge masses, several miles wide,\r\nwhich continue their course—grating along the rocky bottom like\r\nordinary glaciers long after they have reached the salt water. When at\r\nlast they arrive at parts of Baffin’s Bay deep enough to buoy up\r\nicebergs from 1000 to 1500 feet in vertical thickness, broken masses of\r\nthem float off, carrying with them on their surface not only fine mud\r\nand sand but large stones. These fragments of rock are often polished\r\nand scored on one or more sides, and as the ice melts, they drop down\r\nto the bottom of the sea, where large quantities of mud are deposited,\r\nand this muddy bottom is inhabited by many mollusca.\r\n\r\nAlthough the direction of the ice-streams in Greenland may coincide in\r\nthe main with that which separate glaciers would take if there were no\r\nmore ice than there is now in the Swiss Alps, yet the striation of the\r\nsurface of the rocks on an ice-clad continent would, on the whole, vary\r\nconsiderably in its minor details from that which would be imprinted on\r\nrocks constituting a region of separate glaciers. For where there is a\r\nuniversal covering of ice there will be a general outward movement from\r\nthe higher and more central regions towards the circumference and lower\r\ncountry, and this movement will be, to a certain extent, independent of\r\nthe minor inequalities of hill and valley, when these are all reduced\r\nto one level by the snow. The moving ice may sometimes cross even at\r\nright angles deep narrow ravines, or the crests of buried ridges, on\r\nwhich last it may afterwards seem strange to detect glacial striæ and\r\npolishing after the liquefaction of the snow and ice has taken place.\r\n\r\nRink mentions that in North Greenland powerful springs of clayey water\r\nescape in winter from under the ice, where it descends to “the\r\noutskirts,” and where, as already stated, it is often 2000 feet thick—a\r\nfact showing how much grinding action is going on upon the surface of\r\nthe subjacent rocks. I also learn from Dr. Torell that there are large\r\nareas in the outskirts, now no longer covered with permanent snow or\r\nglaciers, which exhibit on their surface unmistakable signs of ancient\r\nice-action, so that, vast as is the power now exerted by ice in\r\nGreenland, it must once have operated on a still grander scale. The\r\nland, though now very elevated, may perhaps have been formerly much\r\nhigher. It is well-known that the south coast of Greenland, from\r\nlatitude 60° to about 70° N., has for the last four centuries been\r\nsinking at the rate of several feet in a century. By this means a\r\nsurface of rock, well scored and polished by ice, is now slowly\r\nsubsiding beneath the sea, and is becoming strewed over, as the\r\nicebergs melt, with impalpable mud and smoothed and scratched stones.\r\nIt is not precisely known how far north this downward movement extends.\r\n\r\nDrift carried by Icebergs.—An account was given so long ago as the year\r\n1822, by Scoresby, of icebergs seen by him in the Arctic seas drifting\r\nalong in latitudes 69° and 70° N., which rose above the surface from\r\n100 to 200 feet, and some of which measured a mile in circumference.\r\nMany of them were loaded with beds of earth and rock, of such thickness\r\nthat the weight was conjectured to be from 50,000 to 100,000 tons. A\r\nsimilar transportation of rocks is known to be in progress in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, where boulders included in ice are far more\r\nfrequent than in the north. One of these icebergs was encountered in\r\n1839, in mid-ocean, in the antarctic regions, many hundred miles from\r\nany known land, sailing northward, with a large erratic block firmly\r\nfrozen into it. Many of them, carefully measured by the officers of the\r\nFrench exploring expedition of the Astrolabe, were between 100 and 225\r\nfeet high above water, and from two to five miles in length. Captain\r\nd’Urville ascertained one of them which he saw floating in the Southern\r\nOcean to be 13 miles long and 100 feet high, with walls perfectly\r\nvertical. The submerged portions of such islands must, according to the\r\nweight of ice relatively to sea-water, be from six to eight times more\r\nconsiderable than the part which is visible, so that when they are once\r\nfairly set in motion, the mechanical force which they might exert\r\nagainst any obstacle standing in their way would be prodigious.\r\n\r\nWe learn, therefore, from a study both of the arctic and antarctic\r\nregions, that a great extent of land may be entirely covered throughout\r\nthe whole year by snow and ice, from the summits of the loftiest\r\nmountains to the sea-coast, and may yet send down angular erratics to\r\nthe ocean. We may also conclude that such land will become in the\r\ncourse of ages almost everywhere scored and polished like the rocks\r\nwhich underlie a glacier. The discharge of ice into the surrounding sea\r\nwill take place principally through the main valleys, although these\r\nare hidden from our sight. Erratic blocks and moraine matter will be\r\ndispersed somewhat irregularly after reaching the sea, for not only\r\nwill prevailing winds and marine currents govern the distribution of\r\nthe drift, but the shape of the submerged area will have its influence;\r\ninasmuch as floating ice, laden with stones, will pass freely through\r\ndeep water, while it will run a ground where there are reefs and\r\nshallows. Some icebergs in Baffin’s Bay have been seen stranded on a\r\nbottom 1000 or even 1500 feet deep. In the course of ages such a\r\nsea-bed may become densely covered with transported matter, from which\r\nsome of the adjoining greater depths may be free. If, as in West\r\nGreenland, the land is slowly sinking, a large extent of the bottom of\r\nthe ocean will consist of rock polished and striated by land-ice, and\r\nthen overspread by mud and boulders detached from melting bergs.\r\n\r\nThe mud, sand, and boulders thus let fall in still water must be\r\nexactly like the moraines of terrestrial glaciers, devoid of\r\nstratification and organic remains. But occasionally, on the outer side\r\nof such packs of stranded bergs, the waves and currents may cause the\r\ndetached earthy and stony materials to be sorted according to size and\r\nweight before they reach the bottom, and to acquire a stratified\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded (p. 172) to the large quantity of ice,\r\ncontaining great blocks of stone, which is sometimes seen floating far\r\nfrom land, in the southern or Antarctic seas. After the emergence,\r\ntherefore, of such a submarine area, the superficial detritus will have\r\nno necessary relation to the hills, valleys, and river-plains over\r\nwhich it will be scattered. Many a water-shed may intervene between the\r\nstarting-point of each erratic or pebble and its final resting-place,\r\nand the only means of discovering the country from which it took its\r\ndeparture will consist in a careful comparison of its mineral or fossil\r\ncontents with those of the parent rocks.\r\n\r\n [1] As to the former excess of cold, whether brought about by\r\n modifications in the height and distribution of the land or by altered\r\n astronomical conditions, see Principles, vol. i, (10th ed., 1867),\r\n chaps. xii and xiii, “Vicissitudes of Climate.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nPOST-PLIOCENE PERIOD, continued.—GLACIAL CONDITIONS, concluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlaciation of Scandinavia and Russia. — Glaciation of Scotland. —\r\nMammoth in Scotch Till. — Marine Shells in Scotch Glacial Drift. —\r\nTheir Arctic Character. — Rarity of Organic Remains in Glacial\r\nDeposits. — Contorted Strata in Drift. — Glaciation of Wales, England,\r\nand Ireland. — Marine Shells of Moel Tryfaen. — Erratics near\r\nChichester. — Glacial Formations of North America. — Many Species of\r\nTestacea and Quadrupeds survived the Glacial Cold. — Connection of the\r\nPredominance of Lakes with Glacial Action. — Action of Ice in\r\npreventing the silting up of Lake-basins. — Absence of Lakes in the\r\nCaucasus. — Equatorial Lakes of Africa.\r\n\r\nGlaciation of Scandinavia and Russia.—In large tracts of Norway and\r\nSweden, where there have been no glaciers in historical times, the\r\nsigns of ice-action have been traced as high as 6000 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea. These signs consist chiefly of polished and furrowed\r\nrock-surfaces, of moraines and erratic blocks. The direction of the\r\nerratics, like that of the furrows, has usually been conformable to the\r\ncourse of the principal valleys; but the lines of both sometimes\r\nradiate outward in all directions from the highest land, in a manner\r\nwhich is only explicable by the hypothesis above alluded to of a\r\ngeneral envelope of continental ice, like that of Greenland (page 170).\r\nSome of the far-transported blocks have been carried from the central\r\nparts of Scandinavia towards the Polar regions; others southward to\r\nDenmark; some south-westward, to the coast of Norfolk in England;\r\nothers south-eastward, to Germany, Poland, and Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of Upsala, in Sweden, I had observed, in\r\n1834, a ridge of stratified sand and gravel, in the midst of which\r\noccurs a layer of marl, evidently formed originally at the bottom of\r\nthe Baltic, by the slow growth of the mussel, cockle, and other marine\r\nshells of living species, intermixed with some proper to fresh water.\r\nThe marine shells are all of dwarfish size, like those now inhabiting\r\nthe brackish waters of the Baltic; and the marl, in which many of them\r\nare imbedded, is now raised more than 100 feet above the level of the\r\nGulf of Bothnia. Upon the top of this ridge repose several huge\r\nerratics, consisting of gneiss for the most part unrounded, from nine\r\nto sixteen feet in diameter, and which must have been brought into\r\ntheir present position since the time when the neighbouring gulf was\r\nalready characterised by its peculiar fauna. Here, therefore, we have\r\nproof that the transport of erratics continued to take place, not\r\nmerely when the sea was inhabited by the existing testacea, but when\r\nthe north of Europe had already assumed that remarkable feature of its\r\nphysical geography which separates the Baltic from the North Sea, and\r\ncauses the Gulf of Bothnia to have only one-fourth of the saltness\r\nbelonging to the ocean. In Denmark, also, recent shells have been found\r\nin stratified beds, closely associated with the boulder clay.\r\n\r\nGlaciation of Scotland.—Mr. T. F. Jamieson, in 1858, adduced a great\r\nbody of facts to prove that the Grampians once sent down glaciers from\r\nthe central regions in all directions towards the sea. “The glacial\r\ngrooves,” he observed, “radiate outward from the central heights\r\ntowards all points of the compass, though they do not always strictly\r\nconform to the actual shape and contour of the minor valleys and\r\nridges.”\r\n\r\nThese facts and other characteristics of the Scotch drift lead us to\r\nthe inference that when the glacial cold first set in, Scotland stood\r\nhigher above the sea than at present, and was covered for the most part\r\nwith snow and ice, as Greenland is now. This sheet of land-ice sliding\r\ndown to lower levels, ground down and polished the subjacent rocks,\r\nsweeping off nearly all superficial deposits of older date, and leaving\r\nonly till and boulders in their place. To this continental state\r\nsucceeded a period of depression and partial submergence. The sea\r\nadvanced over the lower lands, and Scotland was converted into an\r\narchipelago, some marine sand with shells being spread over the bottom\r\nof the sea. On this sand a great mass of boulder clay usually quite\r\ndevoid of fossils was accumulated. Lastly, the land re-emerged from the\r\nwater, and, reaching a level somewhat above its present height, became\r\nconnected with the continent of Europe, glaciers being formed once more\r\nin the higher regions, though the ice probably never regained its\r\nformer extension.[1] After all these changes, there were some minor\r\noscillations in the level of the land, on which, although they have had\r\nimportant geographical consequences, separating Ireland from England,\r\nfor example, and England from the Continent, we need not here enlarge.\r\n\r\n_Mammoth in Scotch Till._—Almost all remains of the terrestrial fauna\r\nof the Continent which preceded the period of submergence have been\r\nlost; but a few patches of estuarine and fresh-water formations escaped\r\ndenudation by submergence. To these belong the peaty clay from which\r\nseveral mammoths’ tusks and horns of reindeer were obtained at\r\nKilmaurs, in Ayrshire as long ago as 1816. Mr. Bryce in 1865\r\nascertained that the fresh-water formation containing these fossils\r\nrests on carboniferous sandstone, and is covered, first by a bed of\r\nmarine sand with arctic shells, and then with a great mass of till with\r\nglaciated boulders.[2] Still more recent explorations in the\r\nneighbourhood of Kilmaurs have shown that the fresh-water formation\r\ncontains the seed of the pond-weed _Potamogeton_ and the aquatic\r\nRanunculus; and Mr. Young of the Glasgow Museum washed the mud adhering\r\nto the reindeer horns of Kilmaurs and that which filled the cracks of\r\nthe associated elephants’ tusks, and detected in these fossils (which\r\nhad been in the Glasgow Museum for half a century) abundance of the\r\nsame seeds.\r\n\r\nAll doubts, therefore, as to the true position of the remains of the\r\nmammoth, a fossil so rare in Scotland, have been set at rest, and it\r\nserves to prove that part of the ancient continent sank beneath the sea\r\nat a period of great cold, as the shells of the overlying sand attest.\r\nThe incumbent till or boulder clay is about 40 feet thick, but it often\r\nattains much greater thickness in the same part of Scotland.\r\n\r\nFigs. 107-112: Northern shells common in the drift of the Clyde, in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n_Marine Shells of Scotch Drift._—The greatest height to which marine\r\nshells have yet been traced in this boulder clay is at Airdie, in\r\nLanarkshire, ten miles east of Glasgow, 524 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. At that spot they were found imbedded in stratified clays with\r\ntill above and below them. There appears no doubt that the overlying\r\ndeposit was true glacial till, as some boulders of granite were\r\nobserved in it, which must have come from distances of sixty miles at\r\nthe least.\r\n\r\nFig. 113: Leda truncata; Fig. 114: Tellina calcarea, Chem.\r\n\r\nThe shells figured in Figs. 107 to 112 are only a few out of a large\r\nassemblage of living species, which, taken as a whole, bear testimony\r\nto conditions far more arctic than those now prevailing in the Scottish\r\nseas. But a group of marine shells, indicating a still greater excess\r\nof cold, has been brought to light since 1860 by the Reverend Thomas\r\nBrown, from glacial drift or clay on the borders of the estuaries of\r\nthe Forth and Tay. This clay occurs at Elie, in Fife, and at Errol, in\r\nPerthshire; and has already afforded about 35 shells, all of living\r\nspecies, and now inhabitants of arctic regions, such as _Leda truncata,\r\nTellina proxima_ (see Figs. 113 and 114), _Pecten Grœnlandicus,\r\nCrenella lævigata, Crenella nigra,_ and others, some of them first\r\nbrought by Captain Sir E. Parry from the coast of Melville Island,\r\nlatitude 76° N. These were all identified in 1863 by Dr. Torell, who\r\nhad just returned from a survey of the seas around Spitzbergen, where\r\nhe had collected no less than 150 species of mollusca, living chiefly\r\non a bottom of fine mud derived from the moraines of melting glaciers\r\nwhich there protrude into the sea. He informed me that the fossil fauna\r\nof this Scotch glacial deposit exhibits not only the species but also\r\nthe peculiar varieties of mollusca now characteristic of very high\r\nlatitudes. Their large size implies that they formerly enjoyed a\r\ncolder, or, what was to them a more genial climate, than that now\r\nprevailing in the latitude where the fossils occur. Marine shells have\r\nalso been found in the glacial drift of Caithness and Aberdeenshire at\r\nheights of 250 feet, and in Banff of 350 feet, and stratified drift\r\ncontinuous with the above ascends to heights of 500 feet. Already 75\r\nspecies are enumerated from Caithness, and the same number from\r\nAberdeenshire and Banff, and in both cases all but six are arctic\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nI formerly suggested that the absence of all signs of organic life in\r\nthe Scotch drift might be connected with the severity of the cold, and\r\nalso in some places with the depth of the sea during the period of\r\nextreme submergence; but my faith in such an hypothesis has been shaken\r\nby modern investigations, an exuberance of life having been observed\r\nboth in arctic and antarctic seas of great depth, and where floating\r\nice abounds. The difficulty, moreover, of accounting for the entire\r\ndearth of marine shells in till is removed when once we have adopted\r\nthe theory of this boulder clay being the product of land-ice. For\r\nglaciers coming down from a continental ice-sheet like that which\r\ncovers Greenland may fill friths many hundred feet below the sea-level,\r\nand even invade parts of a bay a thousand feet deep, before they find\r\nwater enough to float off their terminal portions in the form of\r\nicebergs. In such a case till without marine shells may first\r\naccumulate, and then, if the climate becomes warmer and the ice melts,\r\na marine deposit may be superimposed on the till without any change of\r\nlevel being required.\r\n\r\nAnother curious phenomenon bearing on this subject was styled by the\r\nlate Hugh Miller the “striated pavements” of the boulder clay. Where\r\nportions of the till have been removed by the sea on the shores of the\r\nForth, or in the interior by railway cuttings, the boulders imbedded in\r\nwhat remains of the drift are seen to have been all subjected to a\r\nprocess of abrasion and striation, the striæ and furrows being parallel\r\nand persistent across them all, exactly as if a glacier or iceberg had\r\npassed over them and scored them in a manner similar to that so often\r\nundergone by the solid rocks below the glacial drift. It is possible,\r\nas Mr. Geikie conjectures, that this second striation of the boulders\r\nmay be referable to floating ice.[3]\r\n\r\n_Contorted Strata in Drift._—In Scotland the till is often covered with\r\nstratified gravel, sand, and clay, the beds of which are sometimes\r\nhorizontal and sometimes contorted for a thickness of several feet.\r\nSuch contortions are not uncommon in Forfarshire, where I observed\r\nthem, among other places, in a vertical cutting made in 1840 near the\r\nleft bank of the South Esk, east of the bridge of Cortachie. The\r\nconvolutions of the beds of fine and coarse sand, gravel, and loam,\r\nextend through a thickness of no less than 25 feet vertical, or from\r\n_b_ to _c_, Fig. 115, the horizontal stratification being resumed very\r\nabruptly at a short distance, as to the right of _f_, _g._ The\r\noverlying coarse gravel and sand, _ a_, is in some places horizontal,\r\nin others it exhibits cross bedding, and does not partake of the\r\ndisturbances which the strata _b_, _c_, have undergone. The underlying\r\ntill is exposed for a depth of about 20 feet; and we may infer from\r\nsections in the neighbourhood that it is considerably thicker.\r\n\r\nFig. 15: Section of contorted drift overlying till, seen on left bank\r\nof South Esk, near Cortachie, in 1840.\r\n\r\nIn some cases I have seen fragments of stratified clays and sands, bent\r\nin like manner, in the middle of a great mass of till. Mr. Trimmer has\r\nsuggested, in explanation of such phenomena, the intercalation in the\r\nglacial period of large irregular masses of snow or ice between layers\r\nof sand and gravel. Some of the cliffs near Behring’s Straits, in which\r\nthe remains of elephants occur, consist of ice mixed with mud and\r\nstones; and Middendorf describes the occurrence in Siberia of masses of\r\nice, found at various depths from the surface after digging through\r\ndrift. Whenever the intercalation of snow and ice with drift, whether\r\nstratified or unstratified, has taken place, the melting of the ice\r\nwill cause such a failure of support as may give rise to flexures, and\r\nsometimes to the most complicated foldings. But in many cases the\r\nstrata may have been bent and deranged by the mechanical pressure of an\r\nadvancing glacier, or by the sideway thrust of huge islands of ice\r\nrunning aground against sandbanks; in which case, the position of the\r\nbeds forming the foundation of the banks may not be at all disturbed by\r\nthe shock.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed many signs in Scotland of the action of floating ice,\r\nas might have been expected where proofs of submergence in the Glacial\r\nPeriod are not wanting. Among these are the occurrence of large erratic\r\nblocks, frequently in clusters at or near the tops of hills or ridges,\r\nplaces which may have formed islets or shallows in the sea where\r\nfloating ice would mostly ground and discharge its cargo on melting.\r\nGlaciers or land-ice would, on the contrary, chiefly discharge their\r\ncargoes at the bottom of valleys. Traces of an earlier and independent\r\nglaciation have also been observed in some regions where the striation,\r\napparently produced by ice proceeding from the north-west, is not\r\nexplicable by the radiation of land-ice from a central mountainous\r\nregion.[4]\r\n\r\nGlaciation of Wales and England.—The mountains of North Wales were\r\nrecognised, in 1842, by Dr. Buckland, as having been an independent\r\ncentre of the dispersion of erratics—great glaciers, long since\r\nextinct, having radiated from the Snowdonian heights in Carnarvonshire,\r\nthrough seven principal valleys towards as many points of the compass,\r\ncarrying with them large stony fragments, and grooving the subjacent\r\nrocks in as many directions.\r\n\r\nBesides this evidence of land-glaciers, Mr. Trimmer had previously, in\r\n1831, detected the signs of a great submergence in Wales in the\r\nPost-pliocene period. He had observed stratified drift, from which he\r\nobtained about a dozen species of marine shells, near the summit of\r\nMoel Tryfaen, a hill 1400 feet high, on the south side of the Menai\r\nStraits. I had an opportunity of examining in the summer of 1863,\r\ntogether with the Reverend W. S. Symonds, a long and deep cutting made\r\nthrough this drift by the Alexandra Mining Company in search of slates.\r\nAt the top of the hill above-mentioned we saw a stratified mass of\r\nincoherent sand and gravel 35 feet thick, from which no less than 54\r\nspecies of mollusca, besides three characteristic arctic varieties—in\r\nall 57 forms—have been obtained by Mr. Darbishire. They belong without\r\nexception to species still living in British or more northern seas;\r\neleven of them being exclusively arctic, four common to the arctic and\r\nBritish seas, and a large proportion of the remainder having a\r\nnorthward range, or, if found at all in the southern seas of Britain,\r\nbeing comparatively less abundant. In the lowest beds of the drift were\r\nlarge heavy boulders of far-transported rocks, glacially polished and\r\nscratched on more than one side. Underneath the whole we saw the edges\r\nof vertical slates exposed to view, which here, like the rocks in other\r\nparts of Wales, both at greater and less elevations, exhibit beneath\r\nthe drift unequivocal marks of prolonged glaciation. The whole deposit\r\nhas much the appearance of an accumulation in shallow water or on a\r\nbeach, and it probably acquired its thickness during the gradual\r\nsubsidence of the coast—an hypothesis which would require us to ascribe\r\nto it a high antiquity, since we must allow time, first for its\r\nsinking, and then for its re-elevation.\r\n\r\nThe height reached by these fossil shells on Moel Tryfaen is no less\r\nthan 1300 feet—a most important fact when we consider how very few\r\ninstances we have on record beyond the limits of Wales, whether in\r\nEurope or North America, of marine shells having been found in glacial\r\ndrift at half the height above indicated. A marine molluscous fauna,\r\nhowever, agreeing in character with that of Moel Tryfaen, and\r\ncomprising as many species, has been found in drift at Macclesfield and\r\nother places in central England, sometimes reaching an elevation of\r\n1200 feet.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay[5] estimated the probable amount of submergence during\r\nsome part of the glacial period at about 2300 feet; for he was unable\r\nto distinguish the superficial sands and gravel which reached that high\r\nelevation from the drift which, at Moel Tryfaen and at lower points,\r\ncontains shells of living species. The evidence of the marine origin of\r\nthe highest drift is no doubt inconclusive in the absence of shells, so\r\ngreat is the resemblance of the gravel and sand of a sea beach and of a\r\nriver’s bed, when organic remains are wanting; but, on the other hand,\r\nwhen we consider the general rarity of shells in drift which we know to\r\nbe of marine origin, we cannot suppose that, in the shelly sands of\r\nMoel Tryfaen, we have hit upon the exact uppermost limit of marine\r\ndeposition, or, in other words, a precise measure of the submergence of\r\nthe land beneath the sea since the glacial period.\r\n\r\nWe are gradually obtaining proofs of the larger part of England, north\r\nof a line drawn from the mouth of the Thames to the Bristol Channel,\r\nhaving been under the sea and traversed by floating ice since the\r\ncommencement of the glacial epoch. Among recent observations\r\nillustrative of this point, I may allude to the discovery, by Mr. J. F.\r\nBateman, near Blackpool, in Lancashire, fifty miles from the sea, and\r\nat the height of 568 feet above its level, of till containing rounded\r\nand angular stones and marine shells, such as _Turritella communis,\r\nPurpura lapillus, Cardium edule,_ and others, among which _Trophon\r\nclathratum_ (=_Fusus Bamffius_), though still surviving in North\r\nBritish seas, indicates a cold climate.\r\n\r\n_Erratics near Chichester._—The most southern memorials of ice-action\r\nand of a Post-pliocene fauna in Great Britain is on the coast of the\r\ncounty of Sussex, about 25 miles west of Brighton, and 15 south of\r\nChichester. A marine deposit exposed between high and low tide occurs\r\non both sides of the promontory called Selsea Bill, in which Mr.\r\nGodwin-Austen found thirty-eight species of shells, and the number has\r\nsince been raised to seventy.\r\n\r\nThis assemblage is interesting because on the whole, while all the\r\nspecies are recent, they have a somewhat more southern aspect than\r\nthose of the present British Channel. It is true that about forty of\r\nthem range from British to high northern latitudes; but several of\r\nthem, as, for example, _Lutraria rugosa_ and _ Pecten polymorphous_,\r\nwhich are abundant, are not known at present to range farther north\r\nthan the coast of Portugal, and seem to indicate a warmer temperature\r\nthan now prevails on the coast where we find them fossil. What renders\r\nthis curious is the fact that the sandy loam in which they occur is\r\noverlaid by yellow clayey gravel with large erratic blocks which must\r\nhave been drifted into their present position by ice when the climate\r\nhad become much colder. These transported fragments of granite,\r\nsyenite, and greenstone, as well as of Devonian and Silurian rocks, may\r\nhave come from the coast of Normandy and Brittany, and are many of them\r\nof such large size that we must suppose them to have been drifted into\r\ntheir present site by coast-ice. I measured one of granite, at Pagham,\r\n21 feet in circumference. In the gravel of this drift with erratics are\r\na few littoral shells of living species, indicating an ancient\r\ncoast-line.\r\n\r\nGlacial Formations of North America.—In the western hemisphere, both in\r\nCanada and as far south as the 40th and even 38th parallel of latitude\r\nin the United States, we meet with a repetition of all the\r\npeculiarities which distinguish the European boulder formation.\r\nFragments of rock have travelled for great distances, especially from\r\nnorth to south: the surface of the subjacent rock is smoothed,\r\nstriated, and fluted; unstratified mud or _till_ containing boulders is\r\nassociated with strata of loam, sand, and clay, usually devoid of\r\nfossils. Where shells are present, they are of species still living in\r\nnorthern seas, and not a few of them identical with those belonging to\r\nEuropean drift, including most of those already given in Figs. 107 to\r\n112, p. 176. The fauna also of the glacial epoch in North America is\r\nless rich in species than that now inhabiting the adjacent sea, whether\r\nin the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or off the shores of Maine, or in the Bay\r\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe extension on the American continent of the range of erratics during\r\nthe Post-pliocene period to lower latitudes than they reached in\r\nEurope, agrees well with the present southward deflection of the\r\nisothermal lines, or rather the lines of equal winter temperature. It\r\nseems that formerly, as now, a more extreme climate and a more abundant\r\nsupply of ice prevailed on the western side of the Atlantic. Another\r\nresemblance between the distribution of the drift fossils in Europe and\r\nNorth America has yet to be pointed out. In Canada and the United\r\nStates, as in Europe, the marine shells are generally confined to very\r\nmoderate elevations above the sea (between 100 and 700 feet), while the\r\nerratic blocks and the grooved and polished surfaces of rock extend to\r\nelevations of several thousand feet.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that in Europe several quadrupeds of living,\r\nas well as extinct, species were common to pre-glacial and post-glacial\r\ntimes. In like manner there is reason to suppose that in North America\r\nmuch of the ancient mammalian fauna, together with nearly all the\r\ninvertebrata, lived through the ages of intense cold. That in the\r\nUnited States the _Mastodon giganteus_ was very abundant after the\r\ndrift period, is evident from the fact that entire skeletons of this\r\nanimal are met with in bogs and lacustrine deposits occupying hollows\r\nin the glacial drift. They sometimes occur in the bottom even of small\r\nponds recently drained by the agriculturist for the sake of the\r\nshell-marl. In 1845 no less than six skeletons of the same species of\r\nMastodon were found in Warren county, New Jersey, six feet below the\r\nsurface, by a farmer who was digging out the rich mud from a small pond\r\nwhich he had drained. Five of these skeletons were lying together, and\r\na large part of the bones crumbled to pieces as soon as they were\r\nexposed to the air.\r\n\r\nIt would be rash, however, to infer from such data that these\r\nquadrupeds were mired in _modern_ times, unless we use that term\r\nstrictly in a geological sense. I have shown that there is a fluviatile\r\ndeposit in the valley of the Niagara, containing shells of the genera\r\n_Melania, Lymnea, Planorbis, Velvata, Cyclaz, Unio, Helix,_ etc., all\r\nof recent species, from which the bones of the great Mastodon have been\r\ntaken in a very perfect state. Yet the whole excavation of the ravine,\r\nfor many miles below the Falls, has been slowly effected since that\r\nfluviatile deposit was thrown down. Other extinct animals accompany the\r\n_Mastodon giganteus_ in the post-glacial deposits of the United States,\r\nand this, taken with the fact that so few of the mollusca, even of the\r\ncommencement of the cold period, differ from species now living is\r\nimportant, as refuting the hypothesis, for which some have contended,\r\nthat the intensity of the glacial cold annihilated all the species in\r\ntemperate and arctic latitudes.\r\n\r\nConnection of the Predominance of Lakes with Glacial Action.—It was\r\nfirst pointed out by Professor Ramsay in 1862, that lakes are\r\nexceedingly numerous in those countries where erratics, striated\r\nblocks, and other signs of ice-action abound; and that they are\r\ncomparatively rare in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Generally in\r\ncountries where the winter cold is intense, such as Canada,\r\nScandinavia, and Finland, even the plains and lowlands are thickly\r\nstrewn with innumerable ponds and small lakes, together with some\r\nothers of a larger size; while in more temperate regions, such as Great\r\nBritain, Central and Southern Europe, the United States, and New\r\nZealand, lake districts occur in all such mountainous tracts as can be\r\nproved to have been glaciated in times comparatively modern or since\r\nthe geographical configuration of the surface bore a considerable\r\nresemblance to that now prevailing. In the same countries, beyond the\r\nglaciated regions, lakes abruptly cease, and in warmer and tropical\r\ncountries are either entirely absent, or consist, as in equatorial\r\nAfrica, of large sheets of water unaccompanied so far as we yet know by\r\nnumerous smaller ponds and tarns.\r\n\r\nThe southern limits of the lake districts of the Northern Hemisphere\r\nare found at about 40° N. latitude on the American continent, and about\r\n50° in Europe, or where the Alps intervene four degrees farther south.\r\nA large proportion of the smaller lakes are dammed up by barriers of\r\nunstratified drift, having the exact character of the moraines of\r\nglaciers, and are termed by geologists “morainic,” but some of them are\r\ntrue rock-basins, and would hold water even if all the loose drift now\r\nresting on their margins were removed.\r\n\r\nIn a paper read before the Geological Society of London in 1862,\r\nProfessor Ramsay maintained that the first formation of most existing\r\nlakes took place during the glacial epoch, and was due, not to\r\nelevation or subsidence, but to actual erosion of their basins by\r\nglaciers. M. Mortillet in the same year advanced the theory that after\r\nthe Alpine lake-basins had been filled up with loose fluviatile\r\ndeposits, they were re-excavated by the great glaciers which passed\r\ndown the valleys at the time of the greatest cold, a doctrine which\r\nwould attribute to moving ice almost as great a capacity of erosion as\r\nthat which assumed that the original basins were scooped out of solid\r\nrock by glaciers. It is impossible to deny that the mere geographical\r\ndistribution of lakes points to the intimate connection of their origin\r\nwith the abundance of ice during a former excess of cold, but how far\r\nthe erosive action of moving ice has been the sole or even the\r\nprincipal cause of lake-basins, is a question still open to discussion.\r\n\r\nThe lakes of Switzerland and the north of Italy are some of them twenty\r\nand thirty miles in length, and so deep that their bottoms are in some\r\ncases from 1000 to 2000 feet beneath the level of the sea. It is\r\nadmitted on all hands that they were once filled with ice, and as the\r\nexisting glaciers polish and grind down, as before stated, the surface\r\nof the rocks, we are prepared to find that every lake-basin in\r\ncountries once covered by ice should bear the marks of superficial\r\nglaciation, and also that the ice during its advance and retreat should\r\nhave left behind it much transported matter as well as some evidence of\r\nits having enlarged the pre-existing cavity. But much more than this is\r\ndemanded by the advocates of glacial erosion. They suggest that as the\r\nold extinct glaciers were several thousand feet thick, they were able\r\nin some places gradually to scoop out of the solid rock cavities twenty\r\nor thirty miles in length, and as in the case of Lago Maggiore from a\r\nthousand to two thousand six hundred feet below the previous level of\r\nthe river-channel, and also that the ice had the power to remove from\r\nthe cavity formed by its grinding action all the materials of the\r\nmissing rocks. A constant supply, it is argued, of fine mud issues from\r\nthe termination of every glacier in the stream which is produced by the\r\nmelting of the ice, and this result of friction is exhibited both\r\nduring winter and summer, affording evidence of the continual deepening\r\nand widening of the valleys through which glaciers pass. As the fine\r\nmud is carried away by a river from the deep pool which is formed from\r\nthe base of every cataract, so it seems to be imagined that lake-basins\r\nmay be gradually emptied of the mud formed by abrasion during the\r\nglacial period.\r\n\r\nI am by no means disposed to object to this theory on the ground of the\r\ninsufficiency of the time during which the extreme cold endured, but we\r\nmust carefully consider whether that same time is not so vast as to\r\nmake it probable that other forces, besides the motion of glaciers,\r\nmust have cooperated in converting some parts of the ancient valley\r\ncourses into lake-basins. They who have formed the most exalted\r\nconceptions of the erosive energy of moving ice do not deny that during\r\nthe period termed “Glacial” there have been movements of the earth’s\r\ncrust sufficient to produce oscillations of level in Europe amounting\r\nto 1000 feet or more in both directions. M. Charpentier, indeed,\r\nattributed some of the principal changes of climate in Switzerland,\r\nduring the glacial period, to a depression of the central Alps to the\r\nextent of 3000 feet, and Swiss geologists have long been accustomed to\r\nattribute their lake basins, in part, to those convulsions by which the\r\nshape and course of the valleys may have been modified. Our experience,\r\nin the lifetime of the present generation, of the changes of level\r\nwitnessed in New Zealand during great earthquakes is entirely opposed\r\nto the notion that the movements, whether upward or downward, are\r\nuniform in amount or direction throughout areas of indefinite extent.\r\nOn the contrary, the land has been permanently raised in one region\r\nseveral feet or yards, and the rise has been found gradually to die\r\nout, so as to be imperceptible at a distance of twenty miles, and in\r\nsome areas is even exchanged for a simultaneous downward movement of\r\nseveral feet.\r\n\r\nBut, it is asked, if such inequality of movement can have contributed\r\ntowards the production of lake basins, does it not leave unexplained\r\nthe comparative rarity of lakes in tropical and subtropical countries.\r\nIn reply to this question it may be observed that in our endeavour to\r\nestimate the effects of subterranean movements in modifying the\r\nsuperficial geography of a country we must remember that each\r\nconvulsion effects a very slight change. If it interferes with the\r\ndrainage, whether by raising the lower or sinking the higher portion of\r\na hydrographical basin, the upheaval or depression will only amount to\r\na few feet at a time, and there may be an interval of years or\r\ncenturies before any further movement takes place in the same region.\r\nIn the mean time an incipient lake if produced may be filled up with\r\nsediment, and the recently-formed barrier will then be cut through by\r\nthe river, whereas in a country where glacial conditions prevail no\r\nsuch obliteration of the temporary lake-basin would take place; for\r\nhowever deep it became by repeated sinking of the upper or rising of\r\nthe lower extremity, being always filled with ice it might remain,\r\nthroughout the greater part of its extent, free from sediment or drift\r\nuntil the ice melted at the close of the glacial period.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious objections to the exclusive origin by\r\nice-erosion of wide and deep lake-basins arises from their capricious\r\ndistribution, as for example in Piedmont, both to the eastward and\r\nwestward of Turin, where great lakes are wanting,[6] although some of\r\nthe largest extinct glaciers descending from Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa\r\ncame down from the Alps, leaving their gigantic moraines in the low\r\ncountry. Here, therefore, we might have expected to find lakes of the\r\nfirst magnitude rivalling the contiguous Lago Maggiore in importance.\r\n\r\nA still more striking illustration of the same absence of lakes where\r\nlarge glaciers abound is afforded by the Caucasus, a chain more than\r\n300 miles long, and the loftiest peaks of which attain heights from\r\n16,000 to 18,000 feet. This greatest altitude is reached by Elbruz, a\r\nmountain in lat. 43° N. three degrees south of Mont Blanc, but on the\r\nother hand 3000 feet higher. The present Caucasian glaciers are equal\r\nor superior in dimensions to those of Switzerland, and like them give\r\nrise occasionally to temporary lakes by obstructing the course of\r\nrivers, and causing great floods when the icy barriers give way. Mr.\r\nFreshfield, a careful observer, writing in 1869, says:[7] “A total\r\nabsence of lakes on both sides of the chains is the most marked\r\nfeature. Not only are there no great subalpine sheets of water, like\r\nComo or Geneva, but mountain tarns, such as the Dauben See on the\r\nGemmi, or the Klonthal See near Glarus, are equally wanting.” The same\r\nauthor states on the authority of the eminent Swiss geologist, Mons. E.\r\nFavre, who also explored the Caucasus in 1868, that moraines of great\r\nheight and huge erratics of granite and other rocks “justify the\r\nassertion that the present glaciers of the Caucasus, like those of the\r\nAlps, are only the shadows of their former selves.”\r\n\r\nIt seems safe to assume that the chain of lakes, of which the Albert\r\nNyanza forms one in equatorial Africa, was due to causes other than\r\nglacial. Yet if we could imagine a glacial period to visit that region\r\nfilling the lakes with ice and scoring the rocks which form their sides\r\nand bottoms, we should be unable to decide how much the capacity of the\r\nbasins had been enlarged and the surface modified by glacial erosion.\r\nThe same may be true of the Lago Maggiore and Lake Superior, although\r\nthe present basins of both of them afford abundant superficial markings\r\ndue to ice-action.\r\n\r\nBut to whatever combination of causes we attribute the great Alpine\r\nlakes one thing is clear, namely, that they are, geologically speaking,\r\nof modern origin. Every one must admit that the upper valley of the\r\nRhone has been chiefly caused by fluviatile denudation, and it is\r\nobvious that the quantity of matter removed from that valley previous\r\nto the glacial period would have been amply sufficient to fill up with\r\nsediment the basin of the Lake of Geneva, supposing it to have been in\r\nexistence, even if its capacity had been many times greater than it is\r\nnow.[8]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it appears to me, in accordance with the views of\r\nProfessor Ramsay, M. Mortillet, Mr. Geikie, and others, that the\r\nabrading action of ice has formed some mountain tarns and many morainic\r\nlakes; but when it is a question of the origin of larger and deeper\r\nlakes, like those of Switzerland or the north of Italy, or inland\r\nfresh-water seas, like those of Canada, it will probably be found that\r\nice has played a subordinate part in comparison with those movements by\r\nwhich changes of level in the earth’s crust are gradually brought\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n [1] Jamieson, Quart.

But in parts of England, more especially in Yorkshire,\r\nNorfolk, and Suffolk, there are superficial formations of clay with\r\nglaciated boulders, and of sand and pebbles, containing occasional,\r\nthough rare, patches of shells, in which the marine fauna begins to\r\ndepart from that now inhabiting the neighbouring sea, and comprises\r\nsome species of mollusca not yet known as living, as well as extinct\r\nvarieties of others, entitling us to class them as Newer Pliocene,\r\nalthough belonging to the close of that period and chronologically on\r\nthe verge of the later or Post-pliocene epoch.\r\n\r\nBridlington Drift.—To this era belongs the well-known locality of\r\nBridlington, near the mouth of the Humber, in Yorkshire, where about\r\nseventy species or well-marked varieties of shells have been found on\r\nthe coast, near the sea-level, in a bed of sand several feet thick\r\nresting on glacial clay with much chalk débris, and covered by a\r\ndeposit of purple clay with glaciated boulders. More than a third of\r\nthe species in this drift are now inhabitants of arctic regions, none\r\nof them extending southward to the British seas; which is the more\r\nremarkable as Bridlington is situated in lat. 54° north. Fifteen\r\nspecies are British and Arctic, a very few belong to those species\r\nwhich range south of our British seas. Five species or well-marked\r\nvarieties are not known living, namely, the variety of _Astarte\r\nborealis_ (called _A. Withami_); _ A. mutabilis_; the sinistral form of\r\n_Tritonium carinatum, Cardita analis,_ and _Tellina obliqua,_ Fig. 120,\r\np. 194. Mr. Searles Wood also inclines to consider _Nucula Cobboldiæ,_\r\nFig. 119, p. 194, now absent from the European seas and the Atlantic,\r\nas specifically distinct from a closely-allied shell now living in the\r\nseas surrounding Vancouver’s Island, which some conchologists regard as\r\na variety. _Tellina obliqua_ also approaches very near to a shell now\r\nliving in Japan.\r\n\r\nGlacial Drift of Ireland.—Marine drift containing the last-mentioned\r\nNucula and other glacial shells reaches a height of from 1000 to 1200\r\nfeet in the county of Wexford, south of Dublin. More than eighty\r\nspecies have already been obtained from this formation, of which two,\r\n_Conovulus pyramidalis_ and _ Nassa monensis,_ are not known as living;\r\nwhile _Turritella incrassata_ and _Cypræa lucida_ no longer inhabit the\r\nBritish seas, but occur in the Mediterranean. The great elevation of\r\nthese shells, and the still greater height to which the surface of the\r\nrocks in the mountainous regions of Ireland have been smoothed and\r\nstriated by ice-action, has led geologists to the opinion that that\r\nisland, like the greater part of England and Scotland, after having\r\nbeen united with the continent of Europe, from whence it received the\r\nplants and animals now inhabiting it, was in great part submerged. The\r\nconversion of this and other parts of Great Britain into an archipelago\r\nwas followed by a re-elevation of land and a second continental period.\r\nAfter all these changes the final separation of Ireland from Great\r\nBritain took place, and this event has been supposed to have preceded\r\nthe opening of the straits of Dover.[1]\r\n\r\nFig. 116: Tellina balthica\r\nDrift of Norfolk Cliffs.—There are deposits of boulder clay and till in\r\nthe Norfolk cliffs principally made up of the waste of white chalk and\r\nflints which, in the opinion of Mr. Searles Wood, jun., and others, are\r\nolder than the Bridlington drift, and contain a larger proportion of\r\nshells common to the Norwich and Red Crag, including a certain number\r\nof extinct forms, but also abounding in _Tellina balthica_ (_T.\r\nsolidula,_ Fig. 116), which is found fossil at Bridlington, and living\r\nin our British seas, but wanting in all the formations, even the\r\nnewest, afterwards to be described as Crag. As the greater part of\r\nthese drifts are barren of organic remains, their classification is at\r\npresent a matter of great uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThey can nowhere be so advantageously studied as on the coast between\r\nHappisburgh and Cromer. Here we may see vertical cliffs, sometimes 300\r\nfeet and more in height, exposed for a distance of fifty miles, at the\r\nbase of which the chalk with flints crops out in nearly horizontal\r\nstrata. Beds of gravel and sand repose on this undisturbed chalk. They\r\nare often strangely contorted, and envelop huge masses or erratics of\r\nchalk with layers of vertical flint. I measured one of these fragments\r\nin 1839 at Sherringham, and found it to be eighty feet in its longest\r\ndiameter. It has been since entirely removed by the waves of the sea.\r\nIn the floor of the chalk beneath it the layers of flint were\r\nhorizontal. Such erratics have evidently been moved bodily from their\r\noriginal site, probably by the same glacial action which has polished\r\nand striated some of the accompanying granitic and other boulders,\r\noccasionally six feet in diameter, which are imbedded in the drift.\r\n\r\nCromer Forest-bed.—Intervening between these glacial formations and the\r\nsubjacent chalk lies what has been called the Cromer Forest-bed. This\r\nburied forest has been traced from Cromer to near Kessingland, a\r\ndistance of more than forty miles, being exposed at certain seasons\r\nbetween high and low water mark. It is the remains of an old land and\r\nestuarine deposit, containing the submerged stumps of trees standing\r\nerect with their roots in the ancient soil. Associated with the stumps\r\nand overlying them, are lignite beds with fresh-water shells of recent\r\nspecies, and laminated clay without fossils. Through the lignite and\r\nforest-bed are scattered cones of the Scotch and spruce firs with the\r\nseeds of recent plants, and the bones of at least twenty species of\r\nterrestrial mammalia. Among these are two species of elephant, _E.\r\nmeridionalis,_ Nesti, and _E. antiquus,_ the former found in the Newer\r\nPliocene beds of the Val d’Arno, near Florence. In the same bed occur\r\n_Hippopotamus major, Rhinoceros etruscus,_ both of them also Val d’Arno\r\nspecies, many species of deer considered by Mr. Boyd Dawkins to be\r\ncharacteristic of warmer countries, and also a horse, beaver, and\r\nfield-mouse. Half of these mammalia are extinct, and the rest still\r\nsurvive in Europe. The vegetation taken alone does not imply a\r\ntemperature higher than that now prevailing in the British Isles. There\r\nmust have been a subsidence of the forest to the amount of 400 or 500\r\nfeet, and a re-elevation of the same to an equal extent in order to\r\nallow the ancient surface of the chalk or covering of soil, on which\r\nthe forest grew, to be first covered with several hundred feet of\r\ndrift, and then upheaved so that the trees should reach their present\r\nlevel. Although the relative antiquity of the forest-bed to the\r\noverlying glacial till is clear, there is some difference of opinion as\r\nto its relation to the crag presently to be described.\r\n\r\nFig. 117: Natica helicoides\r\nChillesford and Aldeby Beds.—It is in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk,\r\nand Essex, that we obtain our most valuable information respecting the\r\nBritish Pliocene strata, whether newer or older. They have obtained in\r\nthose counties the provincial name of “Crag,” applied particularly to\r\nmasses of shelly sand which have long been used in agriculture to\r\nfertilise soils deficient in calcareous matter. At Chillesford, between\r\nWoodbridge and Aldborough in Suffolk, and Aldeby, near Beccles, in the\r\nsame county, there occur stratified deposits, apparently older than any\r\nof the preceding drifts of Yorkshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. They are\r\ncomposed at Chillesford of yellow sands and clays, with much mica,\r\nforming horizontal beds about twenty feet thick. Messrs. Prestwich and\r\nSearles Wood, senior, who first described these beds, point out that\r\nthe shells indicate on the whole a colder climate than the Red Crag;\r\ntwo-thirds of them being characteristic of high latitudes. Among these\r\nare _Cardium Grœnlandicum, Leda limatula, Tritonium carinatum,_ and\r\n_Scalaria Grœnlandica._ In the upper part of the laminated clays a\r\nskeleton of a whale was found associated with casts of the\r\ncharacteristic shells, _Nucula Cobboldiæ_ and _Tellina obliqua,_\r\nalready referred to as no longer inhabiting our seas, and as being\r\nextinct varieties if not species. The same shells occur in a perfect\r\nstate in the lower part of the formation. _ Natica helicoides_ (Fig.\r\n117) is an example of a species formerly known only as fossil, but\r\nwhich has now been found living in our seas.\r\n\r\nAt Aldeby, where beds occur decidedly similar in mineral character as\r\nwell as fossil remains, Messrs. Crowfoot and Dowson have now obtained\r\nsixty-six species of mollusca, comprising the Chillesford species and\r\nsome others. Of these about nine-tenths are recent. They are in a\r\nperfect state, clearly indicating a cold climate; as two-thirds of them\r\nare now met with in arctic regions. As a rule, the lamellibranchiate\r\nmolluscs have both valves united, and many of them, such as _Mya\r\narenaria,_ stand with the siphonal end upward, as when in a living\r\nstate. _Tellina balthica,_ before mentioned (Fig. 116) as so\r\ncharacteristic of the glacial beds, including the drift of Bridlington,\r\nhas not yet been found in deposits of Chillesford and Aldeby age,\r\nwhether at Sudbourn, East Bavent, Horstead, Coltishall, Burgh, or in\r\nthe highest beds overlying the Norwich Crag proper at Bramerton and\r\nThorpe.\r\n\r\nFig. 118: <i>Mastodon arvernensis,</i> third milk molar, left side,\r\nupper jaw: grinding surface. Norwich Crag, Postwick, also found in Red\r\nCrag, see p. 197.\r\n\r\nNorwich or Fluvio-marine Crag.—The beds above alluded to ought,\r\nperhaps, to be regarded as beds of passage between the glacial\r\nformations and those called from a provincial name “Crag,” the newest\r\nmember of which has been commonly called the “Norwich Crag.” It is\r\nchiefly seen in the neighbourhood of Norwich, and consists of beds of\r\nincoherent sand, loam, and gravel, which are exposed to view on both\r\nbanks of the Yare, as at Bramerton and Thorpe. As they contain a\r\nmixture of marine, land, and fresh-water shells, with bones of fish and\r\nmammalia, it is clear that these beds have been accumulated at the\r\nbottom of a sea near the mouth of a river. They form patches rarely\r\nexceeding twenty feet in thickness, resting on white chalk. At their\r\njunction with the chalk there invariably intervenes a bed called the\r\n“Stone-bed,” composed of unrolled chalk-flints, commonly of large size,\r\nmingled with the remains of a land fauna comprising _ Mastodon\r\narvernensis, Elephas meridionalis,_ and an extinct species of deer. The\r\nmastodon, which is a species characteristic of the Pliocene strata of\r\nItaly and France, is the most abundant fossil, and one not found in the\r\nCromer forest before mentioned. When these flints, probably long\r\nexposed in the atmosphere, became submerged, they were covered with\r\nbarnacles, and the surface of the chalk became perforated by the\r\n_Pholas crispata,_ each fossil shell still remaining at the bottom of\r\nits cylindrical cavity, now filled up with loose sand from the\r\nincumbent crag. This species of Pholas still exists, and drills the\r\nrocks between high and low water on the British coast. The name of\r\n“Fluvio-marine” has often been given to this formation, as no less than\r\ntwenty species of land and fresh-water shells have been found in it.\r\nThey are all of living species; at least only one univalve, _Paludina\r\nlenta,_ has any, and that a very doubtful, claim to be regarded as\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nFig. 119: Nucula Cobboldiæ; Fig. 120: Tellina obliqua.\r\n\r\nOf the marine shells, 124 in number, about 18 per cent are extinct,\r\naccording to the latest estimate given me by Mr. Searles Wood; but, for\r\nreasons presently to be mentioned, this percentage must be only\r\nregarded as provisional. It must also be borne in mind that the\r\nproportion of recent shells would be augmented if the uppermost beds at\r\nBramerton, near Norwich, which belong to the most modern or Chillesford\r\ndivision of the Crag, had been included, as they were formerly, by Mr.\r\nWoodward and myself, in the Norwich series. Arctic shells, which formed\r\nso large a proportion in the Chillesford and Aldeby beds, are more rare\r\nin the Norwich Crag, though many northern species—such as _Rhynchonella\r\npsittacea, Scalaria Grœnlandica, Astarte borealis, Panopæa Norvegia,_\r\nand others—still occur. The _Nucula Cobboldiæ_ and _Tellina obliqua,_\r\nFigs. 119 and 120, before mentioned, p. 194, are frequent in these\r\nbeds, as are also _Littorina littorea, Cardium edule,_ and _Turritella\r\ncommunis,_ of our seas, proving the littoral origin of the beds.\r\n\r\nOLDER PLIOCENE STRATA.\r\n\r\nRed Crag.—Among the English Pliocene beds the next in antiquity is the\r\nRed Crag, which often rests immediately on the London Clay, as in the\r\ncounty of Essex, illustrated in Fig. 121.\r\n\r\n Fig. 121: Red Crag, London clay and chalk.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly in the county of Suffolk that it is found, rarely\r\nexceeding twenty feet in thickness, and sometimes overlying another\r\nPliocene deposit, the Coralline Crag, to be mentioned in the sequel. It\r\nhas yielded—exclusive of 25 species regarded by Mr. Wood as\r\nderivative—256 species of mollusca, of which 65, or 25 per cent, are\r\nextinct. Thus, apart from its order of superposition, its greater\r\nantiquity than the Norwich and glacial beds, already described, is\r\nproved by the greater departure from the fauna of our seas. It may also\r\nbe observed that in most of the deposits of this Red Crag, the northern\r\nforms of the Norwich Crag, and of such glacial formations as\r\nBridlington, are less numerous, while those having a more southern\r\naspect begin to make their appearance. Both the quartzose sand, of\r\nwhich it chiefly consists, and the included shells, are most commonly\r\ndistinguished by a deep ferruginous or ochreous colour, whence its\r\nname. The shells are often rolled, sometimes comminuted, and the beds\r\nhave much the appearance of having been shifting sand-banks, like those\r\nnow forming on the Dogger-bank, in the sea, sixty miles east of the\r\ncoast of Northumberland. Cross stratification is almost always present,\r\nthe planes of the strata being sometimes directed towards one point of\r\nthe compass, sometimes to the opposite, in beds immediately overlying.\r\nThat such a structure is not deceptive or due to any subsequent\r\nconcretionary rearrangement of particles, or to mere bands of colour\r\nproduced by the iron, is proved by each bed being made up of flat\r\npieces of shell which lie parallel to the planes of the smaller strata.\r\n\r\nIt has long been suspected that the different patches of Red Crag are\r\nnot all of the same age, although their chronological relation cannot\r\nbe decided by superposition. Separate masses are characterised by\r\nshells specifically distinct or greatly varying in relative abundance,\r\nin a manner implying that the deposits containing them were separated\r\nby intervals of time. At Butley, Tunstall, Sudbourn, and in the Red\r\nCrag of Chillesford, the mollusca appear to assume their most modern\r\naspect when the climate was colder than when the earliest deposits of\r\nthe same period were formed. At Butley, _Nucula Cobboldiæ_, so common\r\nin the Norwich and certain glacial beds, is found, and _Purpura\r\ntetragona_ (Fig. 122) is very abundant. On the other hand, at\r\nWalton-on-the-Naze, in Essex, we seem to have an exhibition of the\r\noldest phase of the Red Crag; and a warmer climate seems indicated, not\r\nonly by the absence of many northern forms, but also by the abundance\r\nof some now living in the British seas and the Mediterranean. _Voluta\r\nLamberti_ (see Figs. 123 and 124), an extinct form, which seems to have\r\nflourished chiefly in the antecedent Coralline Crag period, is still\r\nrepresented here by individuals of every age.\r\n\r\nFig. 122: Purpura tetragona.\r\nThe reversed whelk (Fig. 125) is common at Walton, where the dextral\r\nform of that shell is unknown. Here also we find most frequently\r\nspecimens of lamellibranchiate molluscs, with both the valves united,\r\nshowing that they belonged to this sea of the Upper Crag, and were not\r\nwashed in from an older bed, such as the Coralline, in which case the\r\nligament would not have held together the valves in strata so often\r\nshowing signs of the boisterous action of the waves. No less than forty\r\nspecies of lamellibranchiate molluscs, with double valves, have been\r\ncollected by Mr. Bell from the various localities of the Red Crag.\r\n\r\nFig. 123: Voluta Lamberti; Fig. 124: Voluta Lamberti; Fig. 125: Trophon\r\nantiquum.\r\n\r\nAt and near the base of the Red Crag is a loose bed of brown nodules,\r\nfirst noticed by Professor Henslow as containing a large percentage of\r\nearthy phosphates. This bed of coprolites (as it is called, because\r\nthey were originally supposed to be the fæces of animals) does not\r\nalways occur at one level, but is generally in largest quantity at the\r\njunction of the Crag and the underlying formation. In thickness it\r\nusually varies from six to eighteen inches, and in some rare cases\r\namounts to many feet. It has been much used in agriculture for manure,\r\nas not only the nodules, but many of the separate bones associated with\r\nthem, are largely impregnated with phosphate of lime, of which there is\r\nsometimes as much as sixty per cent. They are not unfrequently covered\r\nwith barnacles, showing that they were not formed as concretions in the\r\nstratum where they now lie buried, but had been previously\r\nconsolidated. The phosphatic nodules often collect fossil crabs and\r\nfishes from the London Clay, together with the teeth of gigantic\r\nsharks. In the same bed have been found many ear-bones of whales, and\r\nthe teeth of _Mastodon arvernensis, Rhinoceros Schleiermacheri, Tapirus\r\npriscus,_ and Hipparion (a quadruped of the horse family), and antlers\r\nof a stag, _Cervus anoceros._ Organic remains also of the older chalk\r\nand Lias are met with, showing how great was the denudation of previous\r\nformations during the Pliocene period. As the older White Crag,\r\npresently to be mentioned, contains similar phosphatic nodules near its\r\nbase, those of the Red Crag may be partly derived from this source.\r\n\r\nWhite or Coralline Crag.—The lower or Coralline Crag is of very limited\r\nextent, ranging over an area about twenty miles in length, and three or\r\nfour in breadth, between the rivers Stour and Alde, in Suffolk. It is\r\ngenerally calcareous and marly—often a mass of comminuted shells, and\r\nthe remains of bryozoa[2] (or polyzoa), passing occasionally into a\r\nsoft building-stone. At Sudbourn and Gedgrave, near Orford, this\r\nbuilding-stone has been largely quarried. At some places in the\r\nneighbourhood the softer mass is divided by thin flags of hard\r\nlimestone, and bryozoa placed in the upright position in which they\r\ngrew. From the abundance of these coralloid mollusca the lowest or\r\nWhite Crag obtained its popular name, but true corals, as now defined,\r\nor zoantharia, are very rare in this formation.\r\n\r\nThe Coralline Crag rarely, if ever, attains a thickness of thirty feet\r\nin any one section. Mr. Prestwich imagines that if the beds found at\r\ndifferent localities were united in the probable order of their\r\nsuccession, they might exceed eighty feet in thickness, but Mr. Searles\r\nWood does not believe in the possibility of establishing such a\r\nchronological succession by aid of the organic remains, and questions\r\nwhether proof could be obtained of more than forty feet. I was unable\r\nto come to any satisfactory opinion on the subject, although at Orford,\r\nespecially at Gedgrave, in the neighbourhood of that place, I saw many\r\nsections in pits, where this crag is cut through. These pits are so\r\nunconnected, and of such limited extent, that no continuous section of\r\nany length can be obtained, so that speculations as to the thickness of\r\nthe whole deposit must be very vague. At the base of the formation at\r\nSutton a bed of phosphatic nodules, very similar to that before alluded\r\nto in the Red Crag, with remains of mammalia, has been met with.\r\n\r\nFig. 126: Section near Woodbridge, in Suffolk.\r\n\r\nWhenever the Red and Coralline Crag occur in the same district, the Red\r\nCrag lies uppermost; and in some cases, as in the section represented\r\nin Fig. 126, which I had an opportunity of seeing exposed to view in\r\n1839, it is clear that the older deposit, or Coralline Crag, _b_, had\r\nsuffered denudation, before the newer formation, _a_, was thrown down\r\nupon it. At D there was not only seen a distinct cliff, eight or ten\r\nfeet high, of Coralline Crag, running in a direction N.E. and S.W.,\r\nagainst which the Red Crag abuts with its horizontal layers, but this\r\ncliff occasionally overhangs. The rock composing it is drilled\r\neverywhere by _ Pholades_, the holes which they perforated having been\r\nafterwards filled with sand, and covered over when the newer beds were\r\nthrown down. The older formation is shown by its fossils to have\r\naccumulated in a deeper sea, and contains none of those littoral forms\r\nsuch as the limpet, _Patella_, found in the Red Crag. So great an\r\namount of denudation could scarcely take place, in such incoherent\r\nmaterials, without some of the fossils of the inferior beds becoming\r\nmixed up with the overlying crag, so that considerable difficulty must\r\nbe occasionally experienced by the palæontologist in deciding which\r\nspecies belong severally to each group.\r\n\r\nFig. 127: Fascicularia aurantium, from the inferior or Coralline Crag,\r\nSuffolk. Fig. 128: Astarte Omalii, species common to Upper and Lower\r\nCrag.\r\n\r\nMr. Searles Wood estimates the total number of marine testaceous\r\nmollusca of the Coralline Crag at 350, of which 110 are not known as\r\nliving, being in the proportion of thirty-one per cent extinct. No less\r\nthan 130 species of bryozoa have been found in the Coralline Crag, and\r\nsome belong to genera unknown in the living creation, and of a very\r\npeculiar structure; as, for example, that represented in Fig. 127,\r\nwhich is one of several species having a globular form. Among the\r\ntestacea the genus _Astarte_ (see Fig. 128) is largely represented, no\r\nless than fourteen species being known, and many of these being rich in\r\nindividuals. There is an absence of genera peculiar to hot climates,\r\nsuch as _Conus, Oliva, Fasciolaria, Crassatella_, and others. The\r\nabsence also of large cowries (_Cyprea_), those found belonging\r\nexclusively to the section _Trivia_, is remarkable. The large volute,\r\ncalled _Voluta Lamberti_ (Fig. 123, p. 196), may seem an exception; but\r\nit differs in form from the volutes of the torrid zone, and, like the\r\nliving _Voluta Magellanica_, must have been fitted for an\r\nextra-tropical climate.\r\n\r\nFig. 129: Lingula Dumortieri. Fig. 130: Pyrula reticulata. Fig. 131:\r\nTemnechinus excavatus.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of a species of _Lingula_ at Sutton (see Fig. 129) is\r\nworthy of remark, as these _Brachiopoda_ seem now confined to more\r\nequatorial latitudes; and the same may be said still more decidedly of\r\na species of _Pyrula_, supposed by Mr. Wood to be identical with _P.\r\nreticulata_ (Fig. 130), now living in the Indian Ocean. A genus also of\r\nechinoderms, called by Professor Forbes _Temnechinus_ (Fig. 131),\r\noccurs in the Red and Coralline Crag of Suffolk, and until lately was\r\nunknown in a living state, but it has been brought to light as an\r\nexisting form by the deep-sea dredgings, both of the United States\r\nsurvey, off Florida, at a depth of from 180 to 480 feet, and more\r\nrecently (1869), in the British seas, during the explorations of the\r\n“Porcupine.”\r\n\r\nClimate of the Crag Deposits.—One of the most interesting conclusions\r\ndeduced from a careful comparison of the shells of the British Pliocene\r\nstrata and the fauna of our present seas has been pointed out by\r\nProfessor E. Forbes. It appears that, during the Glacial period, a\r\nperiod intermediate, as we have seen, between that of the Crag and our\r\nown time, many shells, previously established in the temperate zone,\r\nretreated southward to avoid an uncongenial climate, and they have been\r\nfound fossil in the Newer Pliocene strata of Sicily, Southern Italy,\r\nand the Grecian Archipelago, where they may have enjoyed, during the\r\nera of floating icebergs, a climate resembling that now prevailing in\r\nhigher European latitudes.[3] The Professor gave a list of fifty shells\r\nwhich inhabited the British seas while the Coralline and Red Crag were\r\nforming, and which, though now living in our seas, were wanting, as far\r\nas was then known, in the glacial deposits. Some few of these species\r\nhave subsequently been found in the glacial drift, but the general\r\nconclusion of Forbes remains unshaken.\r\n\r\nThe transport of blocks by ice, when the Red Crag was being deposited,\r\nappears to me evident from the large size of some huge, irregular,\r\nquite unrounded chalk flints, retaining their white coating, and 2 feet\r\nlong by 18 inches broad, in beds worked for phosphatic nodules at\r\nFoxhall, four miles south-east of Ipswich. These must have been\r\ntranquilly drifted to the spot by floating ice. Mr. Prestwich also\r\nmentions the occurrence of a large block of porphyry in the base of the\r\nCoralline Crag at Sutton, which would imply that the ice-action had\r\nbegun in our seas even in this older period. The cold seems to have\r\ngone on increasing from the time of the Coralline to that of the\r\nNorwich Crag, and became more and more severe, not perhaps without some\r\noscillations of temperature, until it reached its maximum in what has\r\nbeen called the Glacial period, or at the close of the Newer Pliocene,\r\nand in the Post-pliocene periods.\r\n\r\nRelation of the Fauna of the Crag to that of the recent Seas.—By far\r\nthe greater number of the recent marine species occurring in the\r\nseveral Crag formations are still inhabitants of the British seas; but\r\neven these differ considerably in their relative abundance, some of the\r\ncommonest of the Crag shells being now extremely scarce—as, for\r\nexample, _Buccinum Dalei_—while others, rarely met with in a fossil\r\nstate, are now very common, as _Murex erinaceus_ and _Cardium\r\nechinatum._ Some of the species also, the identity of which with the\r\nliving would not be disputed by any conchologist, are nevertheless\r\ndistinguishable as varieties, whether by slight deviations in form or a\r\ndifference in average dimensions. Since Mr. Searles Wood first\r\ndescribed the marine testacea of the Crags, the additions made to that\r\nfossil fauna have not been considerable, whereas we have made in the\r\nsame period immense progress in our knowledge of the living testacea of\r\nthe British and arctic seas, and of the Mediterranean. By this means\r\nthe naturalist has been enabled to identify with existing species many\r\nforms previously supposed to be extinct.\r\n\r\nIn the forthcoming supplement to the invaluable monograph communicated\r\nby Mr. Wood to the Palæontographical Society, in which he has completed\r\nhis figures and descriptions of the British crag shells of every age,\r\nlist will be found of all the fossil shells, of which a summary is\r\ngiven in the table, p. 202.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the uppermost or Chillesford beds, it will be seen that\r\nabout 9 per cent only are extinct, or not known as living, whereas in\r\nthe Norwich, which succeeds in the descending order, seventeen in a\r\nhundred are extinct. Formerly, when the Norwich or Fluvio-marine Crag\r\nwas spoken of, both these formations were included under the same head,\r\nfor both at Bramerton and Thorpe, the chief localities where the\r\nNorwich Crag was studied, an overlying deposit occurs referable to the\r\nChillesford age. If now the two were fused together as of old, their\r\nshells would, according to Mr. Wood, yield a percentage of fifteen in a\r\nhundred of species extinct or not known as living.\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF KNOWN SPECIES OF MARINE TESTACEA IN THE CRAG.\r\n\r\nCHILLESFORD AND ALDEBY BEDS Total\r\nnumber Not known\r\nas living Percentage of\r\nShells not known\r\nas living Bivalves   61   4 9·5 Univalves   33   5\r\nBrachiopods     0   0 NORWICH OR FLUVIO-MARINE CRAG Bivalves  \r\n61 10 17·5 Univalves   64 12 Brachiopods     1   0\r\nRED CRAG\r\n_(Exclusive to many derivative shells)_ Bivalves 128 31 25·0\r\nUnivalves 127 33 Brachiopods     1   1 CORALLINE CRAG\r\nBivalves 161 47 31·5 Univalves 184 60 Brachiopods    \r\n5   3\r\n\r\nTo come next to the Red Crag, the reader will observe that a percentage\r\nof 25 is given of shells unknown as living, and this increases to 31 in\r\nthe antecedent Coralline Crag. But the gap between these two stages of\r\nour Pliocene deposits is really wider than these numbers would\r\nindicate, for several reasons. In the first place, the Coralline Crag\r\nis more strictly the product of a single period, the Red Crag, as we\r\nhave seen, consisting of separate and independent patches, slightly\r\nvarying in age, of which the newest is probably not much anterior to\r\nthe Norwich Crag. Secondly, there was a great change of conditions,\r\nboth as to the depth of the sea and climate, between the periods of the\r\nCoralline and Red Crag, causing the fauna in each to differ far more\r\nwidely than would appear from the above numerical results.\r\n\r\nThe value of the analysis given in the above table of the shells of the\r\nRed and Coralline Crags is in no small degree enhanced by the fact that\r\nthey were all either collected by Mr. Wood himself, or obtained by him\r\ndirect from their discoverers, so that he was enabled in each case to\r\ntest their authenticity, and as far as possible to avoid those errors\r\nwhich arise from confounding together shells belonging to the sea of a\r\nnewer deposit, and those washed into it from a formation of older date.\r\nThe danger of this confusion may be conceived when we remember that the\r\nnumber of species rejected from the Red Crag as derivative by Mr. Wood\r\nis no less than 25. Some geologists have held that on the same grounds\r\nit is necessary to exclude as spurious some of the species found in the\r\nNorwich Crag proper; but Mr. Wood does not entertain this view,\r\nbelieving that the spurious shells which have sometimes found their way\r\ninto the lists of this crag have been introduced by want of care from\r\nstrata of Red Crag.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, on the other hand, that conchologists have\r\noccasionally rejected from the Red and Norwich Crags, as derivative,\r\nshells which really belonged to the seas of those periods, because they\r\nwere extinct or unknown as living, which in their eyes afforded\r\nsufficient ground for suspecting them to be intruders. The derivative\r\norigin of a species may sometimes be indicated by the extreme scarcity\r\nof the individuals, their colour, and worn condition; whereas an\r\nopposite conclusion may be arrived at by the integrity of the shells,\r\nespecially when they are of delicate and tender structure, or their\r\nabundance, and, in the case of the lamellibranchiata, by their being\r\nheld together by the ligament, which often happens when the shells have\r\nbeen so broken that little more than the hinges of the two valves are\r\npreserved. As to the univalves, I have seen from a pit of Red Crag,\r\nnear Woodbridge, a large individual of the extinct _Voluta Lamberti_,\r\nseven inches in length, of which the lip, then perfect, had in former\r\nstages of its growth been frequently broken, and as often repaired. It\r\nhad evidently lived in the sea of the Red Crag, where it had been\r\nexposed to rough usage, and sustained injuries like those which the\r\nreversed whelk, _Trophon antiquum_, so characteristic of the same\r\nformation, often exhibits. Additional proofs, however, have lately been\r\nobtained by Mr. Searles Wood that this shell had not died out in the\r\nera of the Red Crag by the discovery of the same fossil near Southwold,\r\nin beds of the later Norwich Crag.\r\n\r\nAntwerp Crag.—Strata of the same age as the Red and Coralline Crag of\r\nSuffolk have been long known in the country round Antwerp, and on the\r\nbanks of the Scheldt, below that city; and the lowest division, or\r\nBlack Crag, there found, is shown by the shells to be somewhat more\r\nancient than any of our British series, and probably forms the first\r\nlinks of a downward passage from the strata of the Pliocene to those of\r\nthe Upper Miocene period.\r\n\r\nFig. 132: Murex vaginatus\r\n\r\nNewer Pliocene Strata of Sicily.—At several points north of Catania, on\r\nthe eastern sea-coast of Sicily—as at Aci-Castello, for example,\r\nTrezza, and Nizzeti—marine strata, associated with volcanic tuffs and\r\nbasaltic lavas, are seen, which belong to a period when the first\r\nigneous eruptions of Mount Etna were taking place in a shallow bay of\r\nthe Mediterranean. They contain numerous fossil shells, and out of 142\r\nspecies that have been collected all but eleven are identical with\r\nspecies now living. Some few of these eleven shells may possibly still\r\nlinger in the depths of the Mediterranean, like _Murex vaginatus_, see\r\nFig. 132. The last-mentioned shell had already become rare when the\r\nassociated marine and volcanic strata above alluded to were formed. On\r\nthe whole, the modern character of the testaceous fauna under\r\nconsideration is expressed not only by the small proportion of extinct\r\nspecies, but by the relative number of individuals by which most of the\r\nother species are represented, for the proportion agrees with that\r\nobserved in the present fauna of the Mediterranean. The rarity of\r\nindividuals in the extinct species is such as to imply that they were\r\nalready on the point of dying out, having flourished chiefly in the\r\nearlier Pliocene times, when the Subapennine strata were in progress.\r\n\r\nYet since the accumulation of these Newer Pliocene sands and clays, the\r\nwhole cone of Etna, 11,000 feet in height and about 90 miles in\r\ncircumference at its base, has been slowly built up; an operation\r\nrequiring many tens of thousands of years for its accomplishment, and\r\nto estimate the magnitude of which it is necessary to study in detail\r\nthe internal structure of the mountain, and to see the proofs of its\r\ndouble axis, or the evidence of the lavas of the present great centre\r\nof eruption having gradually overwhelmed and enveloped a more ancient\r\ncone, situated 3½ miles to the east of the present one.[4]\r\n\r\nIt appears that while Etna was increasing in bulk by a series of\r\neruptions, its whole mass, comprising the foundations of subaqueous\r\norigin above alluded to, was undergoing a slow upheaval, by which those\r\nmarine strata were raised to the height of 1200 feet above the sea, as\r\nseen at Catera, and perhaps to greater heights, for we cannot trace\r\ntheir extension westward, owing to the dense and continuous covering of\r\nmodern lava under which they are buried. During the gradual rise of\r\nthese Newer Pliocene formations (consisting of clays, sands, and\r\nbasalts) other strata of Post-pliocene date, marine as well as\r\nfluviatile, accumulated round the base of the mountain, and these, in\r\ntheir turn, partook of the upward movement, so that several inland\r\ncliffs and terraces at low levels, due partly to the action of the sea\r\nand partly to the river Simeto, originated in succession. Fossil\r\nremains of the elephant, and other extinct quadrupeds, have been found\r\nin these Post-Pliocene strata, associated with recent shells.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no part of Europe where the Newer Pliocene formations\r\nenter so largely into the structure of the earth’s crust, or rise to\r\nsuch heights above the level of the sea, as Sicily. They cover nearly\r\nhalf the island, and near its centre, at Castrogiovanni, reach an\r\nelevation of 3000 feet. They consist principally of two divisions, the\r\nupper calcareous and the lower argillaceous, both of which may be seen\r\nat Syracuse, Girgenti, and Castrogiovanni. According to Philippi, to\r\nwhom we are indebted for the best account of the tertiary shells of\r\nthis island, thirty-five species out of one hundred and twenty-four\r\nobtained from the beds in central Sicily are extinct.\r\n\r\nA geologist, accustomed to see nearly all the Newer Pliocene formations\r\nin the north of Europe occupying low grounds and very incoherent in\r\ntexture, is naturally surprised to behold formations of the same age so\r\nsolid and stony, of such thickness, and attaining so great an elevation\r\nabove the level of the sea. The upper or calcareous member of this\r\ngroup in Sicily consists in some places of a yellowish-white stone,\r\nlike the Calcaire Grossier of Paris; in others, of a rock nearly as\r\ncompact as marble. Its aggregate thickness amounts sometimes to 700 or\r\n800 feet. It usually occurs in regular horizontal beds, and is\r\noccasionally intersected by deep valleys, such as those of Sortino and\r\nPentalica, in which are numerous caverns. The fossils are in every\r\nstage of preservation, from shells retaining portions of their animal\r\nmatter and colour to others which are mere casts. The limestone passes\r\ndownward into a sandstone and conglomerate, below which is clay and\r\nblue marl, from which perfect shells and corals may be disengaged. The\r\nclay sometimes alternates with yellow sand.\r\n\r\nSouth of the plain of Catania is a region in which the tertiary beds\r\nare intermixed with volcanic matter, which has been for the most part\r\nthe product of submarine eruptions. It appears that, while the clay,\r\nsand, and yellow limestone before mentioned were in course of\r\ndeposition at the bottom of the sea, volcanoes burst out beneath the\r\nwaters, like that of Graham Island, in 1831, and these explosions\r\nrecurred again and again at distant intervals of time. Volcanic ashes\r\nand sand were showered down and spread by the waves and currents so as\r\nto form strata of tuff, which are found intercalated between beds of\r\nlimestone and clay containing marine shells, the thickness of the whole\r\nmass exceeding 2000 feet. The fissures through which the lava rose may\r\nbe seen in many places, forming what are called _dikes._\r\n\r\nFig. 133: Pecten jacobæus\r\n\r\nNo shell is more conspicuous in these Sicilian strata than the great\r\nscallop, _Pecten jacobæus_ (Fig. 133), now so common in the\r\nneighbouring seas. The more we reflect on the preponderating number of\r\nthis and other recent shells, the more we are surprised at the great\r\nthickness, solidity, and height above the sea of the rocky masses in\r\nwhich they are entombed, and the vast amount of geographical change\r\nwhich has taken place since their origin. It must be remembered that,\r\nbefore they began to emerge, the uppermost strata of the whole must\r\nhave been deposited under water. In order, therefore, to form a just\r\nconception of their antiquity, we must first examine singly the\r\ninnumerable minute parts of which the whole is made up, the successive\r\nbeds of shells, corals, volcanic ashes, conglomerates, and sheets of\r\nlava; and we must afterwards contemplate the time required for the\r\ngradual upheaval of the rocks, and the excavation of the valleys. The\r\nhistorical period seems scarcely to form an appreciable unit in this\r\ncomputation, for we find ancient Greek temples, like those of Girgenti\r\n(Agrigentum), built of the modern limestone of which we are speaking,\r\nand resting on a hill composed of the same; the site having remained to\r\nall appearances unaltered since the Greeks first colonised the island.\r\n\r\nIt follows, from the modern geological date of these rocks, that the\r\nfauna and flora of a large part of Sicily are of higher antiquity than\r\nthe country itself. The greater part of the island has been raised\r\nabove the sea since the epoch of existing species, and the animals and\r\nplants now inhabiting it must have migrated from adjacent countries,\r\nwith whose productions the species are now identical. The average\r\nduration of species would seem to be so great that they are destined to\r\noutlive many important changes in the configuration of the earth’s\r\nsurface, and hence the necessity for those innumerable contrivances by\r\nwhich they are enabled to extend their range to new lands as they are\r\nformed, and to escape from those which sink beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nNewer Pliocene Strata of the Upper Val D’arno.—When we ascend the Arno\r\nfor about ten miles above Florence, we arrive at a deep narrow valley\r\ncalled the Upper Val d’Arno, which appears once to have been a lake, at\r\na time when the valley below Florence was an arm of the sea. The\r\nhorizontal lacustrine strata of this upper basin are twelve miles long\r\nand two broad. The depression which they fill has been excavated out of\r\nEocene and Cretaceous rocks, which form everywhere the sides of the\r\nvalley in highly inclined stratification. The thickness of the more\r\nmodern and unconformable beds is about 750 feet, of which the upper 200\r\nfeet consist of Newer Pliocene strata, while the lower are Older\r\nPliocene. The newer series are made up of sands and a conglomerate\r\ncalled “sansino.” Among the imbedded fossil mammalia are _Mastodon\r\narvernensis, Elephas meridionalis, Rhinoceros etruscus, Hippopotamus\r\nmajor,_ and remains of the genera bear, hyæna, and felis, nearly all of\r\nwhich occur in the Cromer forest-bed (see Chap. 13, p. 191).\r\n\r\nIn the same upper strata are found, according to M. Gaudin, the leaves\r\nand cones of _Glyptostrobus europæus_, a plant closely allied to _G.\r\nheterophyllus_, now inhabiting the north of China and Japan. This\r\nconifer had a wide range in time, having been traced back to the Lower\r\nMiocene strata of Switzerland, and being common at Œningen in the Upper\r\nMiocene, as we shall see in the sequel (p. 218).\r\n\r\nOlder Pliocene of Italy.—Subapennine Strata.—The Apennines, it is\r\nwell-known, are composed chiefly of Secondary or Mesozoic rocks,\r\nforming a chain which branches off from the Ligurian Alps and passes\r\ndown the middle of the Italian peninsula. At the foot of these\r\nmountains, on the side both of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, are\r\nfound a series of tertiary strata, which form, for the most part, a\r\nline of low hills occupying the space between the older chain and the\r\nsea. Brocchi was the first Italian geologist who described this newer\r\ngroup in detail, giving it the name of the Subapennine. Though chiefly\r\ncomposed of Older Pliocene strata, it belongs, nevertheless, in part,\r\nboth to older and newer members of the tertiary series. The strata, for\r\nexample, of the Superga, near Turin, are Miocene; those of Asti and\r\nParma Older Pliocene, as is the blue marl of Sienna; while the shells\r\nof the incumbent yellow sand of the same territory approach more nearly\r\nto the recent fauna of the Mediterranean, and may be Newer Pliocene.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that most of the fossil shells of the Older Pliocene\r\nstrata of Suffolk which are of recent species are identical with\r\ntestacea now living in British seas, yet some of them belong to\r\nMediterranean species, and a few even of the genera are those of warmer\r\nclimates. We might therefore expect, in studying the fossils of\r\ncorresponding age in countries bordering the Mediterranean, to find\r\namong them some species and genera of warmer latitudes. Accordingly, in\r\nthe marls belonging to this period at Asti, Parma, Sienna, and parts of\r\nthe Tuscan and Roman territories, we observe the genera _Conus, Cypræa,\r\nStrombus, Pyrula, Mitra, Fasciolaria, Sigaretus, Delphinula,\r\nAncillaria, Oliva, Terebellum, Terebra, Perna, Plicatula,_ and\r\n_Corbis_, some characteristic of tropical seas, others represented by\r\nspecies more numerous or of larger size than those now proper to the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nOlder Pliocene Flora of Italy.—I have already alluded to the Newer\r\nPliocene deposits of the Upper Val d’Arno above Florence, and stated\r\nthat below those sands and conglomerates, containing the remains of the\r\n_Elephas meridionalis_ and other associated quadrupeds, lie an older\r\nhorizontal and conformable series of beds, which may be classed as\r\nOlder Pliocene. They consist of blue clays with some subordinate layers\r\nof lignite, and exhibit a richer flora than the overlying Newer\r\nPliocene beds, and one receding farther from the existing vegetation of\r\nEurope. They also comprise more species common to the antecedent\r\nMiocene period. Among the genera of flowering plants, M. Gaudin\r\nenumerates pine, oak, evergreen oak, plum, plane, alder, elm, fig,\r\nlaurel, maple, walnut, birch, buckthorn, hickory, sumach, sarsaparilla,\r\nsassafras, cinnamon, Glyptostrobus, Taxodium, Sequoia, Persea,\r\nOreodaphne (Fig. 134), Cassia, and Psoralea, and some others. This\r\nassemblage of plants indicates a warm climate, but not so subtropical\r\nan one as that of the Upper Miocene period, which will presently be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nFig. 134: Creodaphne Heerii.

Gaudin, jointly with the Marquis Strozzi, has thrown much light on\r\nthe botany of beds of the same age in another part of Tuscany, at a\r\nplace called Montajone, between the rivers Elsa and Evola, where, among\r\nother plants, is found the _Oreodaphne Heerii_, Gaud. (see Fig. 134),\r\nwhich is probably only a variety of _Oreodaphne foetens_, or the laurel\r\ncalled the Til in Madeira, where, as in the Canaries, it constitutes a\r\nlarge portion of the native woods, but cannot now endure the climate of\r\nEurope. In the fossil specimens the same glands or protuberances are\r\npreserved[6] (see Fig. 134) as those which are seen in the axils of the\r\nprimary veins of the leaves in the recent Til. Another plant also\r\nindicating a warmer climate is the _ Liquidambar europæum_, Brong. (see\r\nFig. 135), a species nearly allied to _L. styracifluum_, L., which\r\nflourishes in most places in the Southern States of North America, on\r\nthe borders of the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n [1] See Antiquity of Man, chap. xiv.\r\n\r\n [2] Ehrenberg proposed in 1831 the term _ Bryozoum_, or “Moss-animal,”\r\n for the molluscous or ascidian form of polyp, characterised by having\r\n two openings to the digestive sack, as in _Eschara, Flustra,\r\n Retepora,_ and other zoophytes popularly included in the corals, but\r\n now classed by naturalists as mollusca. The term _Polyzoum,_\r\n synonymous with _ Bryozoum,_ was, it seems, proposed in 1830, or the\r\n year before, by Mr. J. O. Thompson.\r\n\r\n [3] E. Forbes Mem. Geol. Survey of Gt.

I shall now call these falunian deposits Upper\r\nMiocene, to distinguish them from others to which the name of Lower\r\nMiocene will be given.\r\n\r\nNo British strata have a distinct claim to be regarded as Upper\r\nMiocene, and as the Lower Miocene are also but feebly represented in\r\nthe British Isles, we must refer to foreign examples in illustration of\r\nthis important period in the earth’s history. The term “faluns” is\r\ngiven provincially by French agriculturists to shelly sand and marl\r\nspread over the land in Touraine, just as similar shelly deposits were\r\nformerly much used in Suffolk to fertilise the soil, before the\r\ncoprolitic or phosphatic nodules came into use. Isolated masses of such\r\nfaluns occur from near the mouth of the Loire, in the neighbourhood of\r\nNantes, to as far inland as a district south of Tours. They are also\r\nfound at Pontlevoy, on the Cher, about seventy miles above the junction\r\nof that river with the Loire, and thirty miles south-east of Tours.\r\nDeposits of the same age also appear under new mineral conditions near\r\nthe towns of Dinan and Rennes, in Brittany. I have visited all the\r\nlocalities above enumerated, and found the beds on the Loire to consist\r\nprincipally of sand and marl, in which are shells and corals, some\r\nentire, some rolled, and others in minute fragments. In certain\r\ndistricts, as at Doué, in the Department of Maine and Loire, ten miles\r\nsouth-west of Saumur, they form a soft building-stone, chiefly composed\r\nof an aggregate of broken shells, bryozoa, corals, and echinoderms,\r\nunited by a calcareous cement; the whole mass being very like the\r\nCoralline Crag near Aldborough, and Sudbourn in Suffolk. The scattered\r\npatches of faluns are of slight thickness, rarely exceeding fifty feet;\r\nand between the district called Sologne and the sea they repose on a\r\ngreat variety of older rocks; being seen to rest successively upon\r\ngneiss, clay-slate, various secondary formations, including the chalk;\r\nand, lastly, upon the upper fresh-water limestone of the Parisian\r\ntertiary series, which, as before mentioned (p. 142), stretches\r\ncontinuously from the basin of the Seine to that of the Loire.\r\n\r\nFig. 136: Dinotherium giganteum.\r\nAt some points, as at Louans, south of Tours, the shells are stained of\r\na ferruginous colour, not unlike that of the Red Crag of Suffolk. The\r\nspecies are, for the most part, marine, but a few of them belong to\r\nland and fluviatile genera. Among the former, _ Helix turonensis)_\r\n(Fig. 38) is the most abundant. Remains of terrestrial quadrupeds are\r\nhere and there intermixed, belonging to the genera Dinotherium (Fig.\r\n136), Mastodon, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, Chæropotamus, Dichobune,\r\nDeer, and others, and these are accompanied by cetacea, such as the\r\nLamantin, Morse, Sea-calf, and Dolphin, all of extinct species.\r\n\r\nThe fossil testacea of the faluns of the Loire imply, according to the\r\nlate Edward Forbes, that the beds were formed partly on the shore\r\nitself at the level of low water, and partly at very moderate depths,\r\nnot exceeding ten fathoms below that level. The molluscan fauna is, on\r\nthe whole, much more littoral than that of the Pliocene Red and\r\nCoralline Crag of Suffolk, and implies a shallower sea. It is,\r\nmoreover, contrasted with the Suffolk Crag by the indications it\r\naffords of an extra-European climate. Thus it contains seven species of\r\nCypræa, some larger than any existing cowry of the Mediterranean,\r\nseveral species of _Oliva, Ancillaria, Mitra, Terebra, Pyrula,\r\nFasciolaria,_ and _ Conus._ Of the cones there are no less than eight\r\nspecies, some very large, whereas the only European cone now living is\r\nof diminutive size. The genus _Nerita,_ and many others, are also\r\nrepresented by individuals of a type now characteristic of equatorial\r\nseas, and wholly unlike any Mediterranean forms. These proofs of a more\r\nelevated temperature seem to imply the higher antiquity of the faluns\r\nas compared with the Suffolk Crag, and are in perfect accordance with\r\nthe fact of the smaller proportion of testacea of recent species found\r\nin the faluns.\r\n\r\nOut of 290 species of shells, collected by myself in 1840 at Pontlevoy,\r\nLouans, Bossée, and other villages twenty miles south of Tours, and at\r\nSavigné, about fifteen miles north-west of that place, seventy-two only\r\ncould be identified with recent species, which is in the proportion of\r\ntwenty-five per cent. A large number of the 290 species are common to\r\nall the localities, those peculiar to each not being more numerous than\r\nwe might expect to find in different bays of the same sea.\r\n\r\nThe total number of species of testaceous mollusca from the faluns in\r\nmy possession is 302, of which forty-five only, or fourteen per cent,\r\nwere found by Mr. Wood to be common to the Suffolk Crag. The number of\r\ncorals, including bryozoa and zoantharia, obtained by me at Doué and\r\nother localities before adverted to, amounts to forty-three, as\r\ndetermined by Mr. Lonsdale, of which seven (one of them a zoantharian)\r\nagree specifically with those of the Suffolk Crag. Some of the genera\r\noccurring fossil in Touraine, as the corals Astrea and _\r\nDendrophyllia_, and the bryozoan _Lunulites_, have not been found in\r\nEuropean seas north of the Mediterranean; nevertheless, the zoantharia\r\nof the faluns do not seem to indicate, on the whole, so warm a climate\r\nas would be inferred from the shells.\r\n\r\nIt was stated that, on comparing about 300 species of Touraine shells\r\nwith about 450 from the Suffolk Crag, forty-five only were found to be\r\ncommon to both, which is in the proportion of only fifteen per cent.\r\nThe same small amount of agreement is found in the corals also. I\r\nformerly endeavoured to reconcile this marked difference in species\r\nwith the supposed co-existence of the two faunas, by imagining them to\r\nhave severally belonged to distinct zoological provinces or two seas,\r\nthe one opening to the north and the other to the south, with a barrier\r\nof land between them, like the Isthmus of Suez, now separating the Red\r\nSea and the Mediterranean. But I now abandon that idea for several\r\nreasons; among others, because I succeeded in 1841 in tracing the Crag\r\nfauna southward in Normandy to within seventy miles of the Falunian\r\ntype, near Dinan, yet found that both assemblages of fossils retained\r\ntheir distinctive characters, showing no signs of any blending of\r\nspecies or transition of climate.\r\n\r\nThe principal grounds, however, for referring the English Crag to the\r\nolder Pliocene and the French faluns to the Upper Miocene epochs,\r\nconsist in the predominance of fossil shells in the British strata\r\nidentifiable with species not only still living, but which are now\r\ninhabitants of neighbouring seas, while the accompanying extinct\r\nspecies are of genera such as characterise Europe. In the faluns, on\r\nthe contrary, the recent species are in a decided minority; and most of\r\nthem are now inhabitants of the Mediterranean, the coast of Africa, and\r\nthe Indian Ocean; in a word, less northern in character, and pointing\r\nto the prevalence of a warmer climate. They indicate a state of things\r\nreceding farther from the present condition of Central Europe in\r\nphysical geography and climate, and doubtless, therefore, receding\r\nfarther from our era in time.\r\n\r\nFig. 137: Voluta Lamberti.\r\nAmong the conspicuous fossils common to the faluns of the Loire and the\r\nSuffolk Crag is a variety of the _Voluta Lamberti_, a shell already\r\nalluded to (Fig. 123). The specimens of this shell which I have myself\r\ncollected in Touraine, or have seen in museums, are thicker and heavier\r\nthan British individuals of the same species, and shorter in proportion\r\nto their width, and have the folds on the columella less oblique, as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 137.\r\n\r\nUpper Miocene of Bordeaux and the South of France.—A great extent of\r\ncountry between the Pyrenees and the Gironde is overspread by tertiary\r\ndeposits of various ages, and chiefly of Miocene date. Some of these,\r\nnear Bordeaux, coincide in age with the faluns of Touraine, already\r\nmentioned, but many of the species of shells are peculiar to the south.\r\nThe succession of beds in the basin of the Gironde implies several\r\noscillations of level by which the same wide area was alternately\r\nconverted into sea and land and into brackish-water lagoons, and\r\nfinally into fresh-water ponds and lakes.\r\n\r\nAmong the fresh-water strata of this age near the base of the Pyrenees\r\nare marls, limestones and sands, in which the eminent comparative\r\nanatomist, M. Lartet, has obtained a great number of fossil mammalia\r\ncommon to the faluns of the Loire and the Upper Miocene beds of\r\nSwitzerland, such as _Dinotherium giganteum_ and _Mastodon\r\nangustidens_; also the bones of quadrumana, or of the ape and monkey\r\ntribe, which were discovered in 1837, the first of that order of\r\nquadrupeds detected in Europe. They were found near Auch, in the\r\nDepartment of Gers, in latitude 43° 39′ N. About forty miles west of\r\nToulouse. They were referred by MM. Lartet and Blainville to a genus\r\nclosely allied to the Gibbon, to which they gave the name of\r\n_Pliopithecus._ Subsequently, in 1856, M. Lartet described another\r\nspecies of the same family of long-armed apes (_Hylobates_), which he\r\nobtained from strata of the same age at Saint-Gaudens, in the Haute\r\nGaronne. The fossil remains of this animal consisted of a portion of a\r\nlower jaw with teeth and the shaft of a humerus. It is supposed to have\r\nbeen a tree-climbing frugivorous ape, equalling man in stature. As the\r\ntrunks of oaks are common in the lignite beds in which it lay, it has\r\nreceived the generic name of _Dryopithecus._ The angle formed by the\r\nascending ramus of the jaw and the alveolar border is less open, and\r\ntherefore more like the human subject, than in the Chimpanzee, and what\r\nis still more remarkable, the fossil, a young but adult individual, had\r\nall its milk teeth replaced by the second set, while its last true\r\nmolar (or wisdom-tooth) was still undeveloped, or only existed as a\r\ngerm in the jaw-bone. In the mode, therefore, of the succession of its\r\nteeth (which, as in all the old-World apes, exactly agree in number\r\nwith those in man) it differed from the Gorilla and Chimpanzee, and\r\ncorresponded with the human species.\r\n\r\nUpper Miocene Beds of Œningen, in Switzerland.—The faluns of the Loire\r\nfirst served, as already stated (p. 211), as the type of the Miocene\r\nformations in Europe. They yielded a plentiful harvest of marine fossil\r\nshells and corals, but were entirely barren of plants and insects. In\r\nSwitzerland, on the other hand, deposits of the same age have been\r\ndiscovered, remarkable for their botanical and entomological treasures.\r\nWe are indebted to Professor Heer, of Zurich, for the description,\r\nrestoration, and classification of several hundred species and\r\nvarieties of these fossil plants, the whole of which he has illustrated\r\nby excellent figures in his “Flora Tertiaria Helvetiæ.” This great\r\nwork, and those of Adolphe Brongniart, Unger, Goppert and others, show\r\nthat this class of fossils is beginning to play the same important part\r\nin the classification of the tertiary strata containing lignite or\r\nbrown coal as an older flora has long played in enabling us to\r\nunderstand the ancient coal or carboniferous formation. No small\r\nskepticism has always prevailed among botanists as to whether the\r\nleaves alone and the wood of plants could ever afford sufficient data\r\nfor determining even genera and families in the vegetable kingdom. In\r\ntruth, before such remains could be rendered available a new science\r\nhad to be created. It was necessary to study the outlines, nervation,\r\nand microscopic structure of the leaves, with a degree of care which\r\nhad never been called for in the classification of living plants, where\r\nthe flower and fruit afforded characters so much more definite and\r\nsatisfactory. As geologists, we cannot be too grateful to those who,\r\ninstead of despairing when so difficult a task was presented to them,\r\nor being discouraged when men of the highest scientific attainments\r\ntreated the fossil leaves as worthless, entered with full faith and\r\nenthusiasm into this new and unexplored field. That they should\r\nfrequently have fallen into errors was unavoidable, but it is\r\nremarkable, especially if we inquire into the history of Professor\r\nHeer’s researches, how often early conjectures as to the genus and\r\nfamily founded on the leaves alone were afterwards confirmed when\r\nfuller information was obtained. As examples to be found on comparing\r\nHeer’s earlier and later works, I may instance the chestnut, elm,\r\nmaple, cinnamon, magnolia, buckbean or Menyanthes, vine, buckthorn\r\n(_Rhamnus_), _Andromeda_ and _Myrica,_ and among the conifers _Sequoia_\r\nand _ Taxodium._ In all these cases the plants were first recognised by\r\ntheir leaves, and the accuracy of the determination was afterwards\r\nconfirmed when the fruit, and in some instances both fruit and flower,\r\nwere found attached to the same stem as the leaves.\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose that no fruit, seed, or flower had ever been met\r\nwith in a fossil state, we should still have been indebted to the\r\npersevering labours of botanical palæontologists for one of the\r\ngrandest scientific discoveries for which the present century is\r\nremarkable—namely, the proofs now established of the prevalence of a\r\nmild climate and a rich arborescent flora in the arctic regions in that\r\nMiocene epoch on the history of which we are now entering. It may be\r\nuseful if I endeavour to give the reader in a few words some idea of\r\nthe nature of the evidence of these important conclusions, to show how\r\nfar they may be safely based on fossil leaves alone. When we begin by\r\nstudying the fossils of the Newer Pliocene deposits, such as those of\r\nthe Upper Val d’Arno, before alluded to, we perceive that the fossil\r\nfoliage agrees almost entirely with the trees and shrubs of a modern\r\nEuropean forest. In the plants of the Older Pliocene strata of the same\r\nregion we observe a larger proportion of species and genera which,\r\nalthough they may agree with well-known Asiatic or other foreign types,\r\nare at present wanting in Italy. If we then examine the Miocene\r\nformations of the same country, exotic forms become more abundant,\r\nespecially the palms, whether they belong to the European or American\r\nfan-palms, _Chamærops_ and _Sabal_, or to the more tropical family of\r\nthe date-palms or _Phœnicites_, which last are conspicuous in the Lower\r\nMiocene beds of Central Europe. Although we have not found the fruit or\r\nflower of these palms in a fossil state, the leaves are so\r\ncharacteristic that no one doubts the family to which they belong, or\r\nhesitates to accept them as indications of a warm and sub-tropical\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nWhen the Miocene formations are traced to the northward of the 50th\r\ndegree of latitude, the fossil palms fail us, but the greater\r\nproportion of the leaves, whether identical with those of existing\r\nEuropean trees or of forms now unknown in Europe, which had accompanied\r\nthe Miocene palms, still continue to characterise rocks of the same\r\nage, until we meet with them not only in Iceland, but in Greenland, in\r\nlatitude 70° N., and in Spitzbergen, latitude 78° 56′, or within about\r\n11 degrees of the pole, and under circumstances which clearly show them\r\nto have been indigenous in those regions, and not to have been drifted\r\nfrom the south (see p. 240). Not only, therefore, has the botanist\r\nafforded the geologist much palæontological assistance in identifying\r\ndistinct tertiary formations in distant places by his power of\r\naccurately discriminating the forms, veining, and microscopic structure\r\nof leaves or wood, but, independently of that exact knowledge derivable\r\nfrom the organs of fructification, we are indebted to him for one of\r\nthe most novel, unexpected results of modern scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Miocene formations of Switzerland have been called _ Molasse_, a\r\nterm derived from the French _mol_, and applied to a _soft_,\r\nincoherent, greenish sandstone, occupying the country between the Alps\r\nand the Jura. This molasse comprises three divisions, of which the\r\nmiddle one is marine, and being closely related by its shells to the\r\nfaluns of Touraine, may be classed as Upper Miocene. The two others are\r\nfresh-water, the upper of which may be also grouped with the faluns,\r\nwhile the lower must be referred to the Lower Miocene, as defined in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nUpper Fresh-water Molasse.—This formation is best seen at Œningen, in\r\nthe valley of the Rhine, between Constance and Schaffhausen, a locality\r\ncelebrated for having produced in the year 1700 the supposed human\r\nskeleton called by Scheuchzer “homo diluvii testis,” a fossil\r\nafterwards demonstrated by Cuvier to be a reptile, or aquatic\r\nsalamander, of larger dimensions than even its great living\r\nrepresentative, the salamander of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Œningen strata consist of a series of marls and limestones, many of\r\nthem thinly laminated, and which appear to have slowly accumulated in a\r\nlake probably fed by springs holding carbonate of lime in solution. The\r\nelliptical area over which this fresh-water formation has been traced\r\nextends, according to Sir Roderick Murchison, for a distance of ten\r\nmiles east and west from Berlingen, on the right bank of the river to\r\nWangen, and to Œningen, near Stein, on the left bank. The organic\r\nremains have been chiefly derived from two quarries, the lower of which\r\nis about 550 feet above the level of the Lake of Constance, while the\r\nupper quarry is 150 feet higher. In this last, a section thirty feet\r\ndeep displays a great succession of beds, most of them splitting into\r\nslabs and some into very thin laminæ. Twenty-one beds are enumerated by\r\nProfessor Heer, the uppermost a bluish-grey marl seven feet thick, with\r\norganic remains, resting on a limestone with fossil plants, including\r\nleaves of poplar, cinnamon, and pond-weed (_Potamogeton_), together\r\nwith some insects; while in the bed No. 4, below, is a bituminous rock,\r\nin which the _Mastodon tapiroides_, a characteristic Upper Miocene\r\nquadruped, has been met with. The 5th bed, two or three inches thick,\r\ncontains fossil fish, e.g., _Leuciscus_ (roach), and the larvæ of\r\ndragon-flies, with plants such as the elm (_Ulmus_), and the aquatic\r\nChara. Below this are other plant-beds; and then, in No. 9, the stone\r\nin which the great salamander (Andrias Scheuchzeri) and some fish were\r\nfound. Below this other strata occur with fish, tortoises, the great\r\nsalamander before alluded to, fresh-water mussels, and plants. In No.\r\n16 the fossil fox of Œningen, _Galecynus Œningensis,_ Owen, was\r\nobtained by Sir R. Murchison. To this succeed other beds with mammalia\r\n(_Lagomys_), reptiles, (_Emys_), fish, and plants, such as walnut,\r\nmaple, and poplar. In the 19th bed are numerous fish, insects, and\r\nplants, below which are marls of a blue indigo colour.\r\n\r\nIn the lower quarry eleven beds are mentioned, in which, as in the\r\nupper, both land and fresh-water plants and many insects occur. In the\r\n6th, reckoning from the top, many plants have been obtained, such as\r\n_Liquidambar, Daphnogene, Podogonium,_ and _ Ulmus_, together with\r\ntortoises, besides the bones and teeth of a ruminant quadruped, named\r\nby H. von Meyer _Palæomeryx eminens._ No. 9 is called the insect-bed, a\r\nlayer only a few inches thick, which, when exposed to the frost, splits\r\ninto leaves as thin as paper. In these thin laminæ plants such as _\r\nLiquidambar, Daphnogene,_ and _Glyptostrobus_, occur, with innumerable\r\ninsects in a wonderful state of preservation, usually found singly.\r\nBelow this is an indigo-blue marl, like that at the bottom of the\r\nhigher quarry, resting on yellow marl ascertained to be at least thirty\r\nfeet thick.\r\n\r\nFig. 138: Cinnamomum polymorphum.\r\nAll the above fossil-bearing strata were evidently formed with extreme\r\nslowness. Although the fossiliferous beds are, in the aggregate, no\r\nmore than a few yards in thickness, and have only been examined in the\r\nsmall area comprised in the two quarries just alluded to, they give us\r\nan insight into the state of animal and vegetable life in part of the\r\nUpper Miocene period, such as no other region in the world has\r\nelsewhere supplied. In the year 1859, Professor Heer had already\r\ndetermined no less than 475 species of plants and more than 800 insects\r\nfrom these Œningen beds. He supposes that a river entering a lake\r\nfloated into it some of the leaves and land insects, together with the\r\ncarcasses of quadrupeds, among others a great Mastodon. Occasionally,\r\nduring tempests, twigs and even boughs of trees with their leaves were\r\ntorn off and carried for some distance so as to reach the lake.\r\nSprings, containing carbonate of lime, seem at some points to have\r\nsupplied calcareous matter in solution, giving origin locally to a kind\r\nof travertin, in which organic bodies sinking to the bottom became\r\nhermetically sealed up. The laminæ, says Heer, which immediately\r\nsucceed each other were not all formed at the same season, for it can\r\nbe shown that, when some of them originated, certain plants were in\r\nflower, whereas, when the next of these layers was produced, the same\r\nplants had ripened their fruit. This inference is confirmed by\r\nindependent proofs derived from insects. The principal insect-bed is\r\nrarely two inches thick, and is composed, says Heer, of about 250\r\nleaf-like laminæ, some of which were deposited in the spring, when the\r\n_Cinnamomum polymorphum_ (Fig. 138) was in flower, others in summer,\r\nwhen winged ants were numerous, and when the poplar and willow had\r\nmatured their seed; others, again, in autumn, when the same _\r\nCinnamomum polymorphum_ (Fig. 138) was in fruit, as well as the\r\nliquidambar, oak, clematis, and many other plants. The ancient lake\r\nseems to have had a belt of poplars and willows round its borders,\r\ncountless leaves of which were imbedded in mud, and together with them,\r\nat some points, a species of reed, _Arundo_, which was very common.\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic shrubs is a papilionaceous and\r\nleguminous plant of an extinct genus, called by Heer _ Podogonium_, of\r\nwhich two species are known. Entire twigs have been found with flowers,\r\nand always without leaves, as the flowers evidently came out, as in the\r\npoplar and willow tribe, before any leaves made their appearance. Other\r\nspecimens have been obtained with ripe fruits accompanied by leaves,\r\nwhich resemble those of the tamarind, to which it was evidently allied,\r\nbeing of the family Cæsalpineæ, now proper to warmer regions.\r\n\r\nFig. 138: Acer trilobatum.\r\nThe Upper Miocene flora of Œningen is peculiarly important, in\r\nconsequence of the number of genera of which not merely the leaves,\r\nbut, as in the case of the _Podogonium_ just mentioned, the fruit also\r\nand even the flower are known. Thus there are nineteen species of\r\nmaple, ten of which have already been found with fruit. Although in no\r\none region of the globe do so many maples now flourish, we need not\r\nsuspect Professor Heer of having made too many species in this genus\r\nwhen we consider the manner in which he has dealt with one of them,\r\n_Acer trilobatum_, Figs. 139 and 140. Of this plant the number of\r\nmarked varieties figured and named is very great, and no less than\r\nthree of them had been considered as distinct species by other\r\nbotanists, while six of the others might have laid claim, with nearly\r\nequal propriety, to a like distinction. The common form, called _Acer\r\ntrilobatum_, Fig. 139, may be taken as a normal representative of the\r\nŒningen fossil, and Fig. 140, as one of the most divergent varieties,\r\nhaving almost four lobes in the leaf instead of three.\r\n\r\nFig. 140: Acer trilobatum.\r\n\r\nAmong the conspicuous genera which abounded in the Miocene period in\r\nEurope is the plane-tree, _Platanus,_ the fossil species being\r\nconsidered by Heer to come nearer to the American _ P. occidentalis_\r\nthan to _P. orientalis_ of Greece and Asia Minor. In some of the fossil\r\nspecimens the male flowers are preserved. Among other points of\r\nresemblance with the living plane-trees, as we see them in the parks\r\nand squares of London, fossil fragments of the trunk are met with,\r\nhaving pieces of their bark peeling off.\r\n\r\nPlatanus aceroides.\r\nThe vine of Œningen, _Vitis teutonica_, Ad. Brong, is of a North\r\nAmerican type. Both the leaves and seeds have been found at Œningen,\r\nand bunches of compressed grapes of the same species have been met with\r\nin the brown coal of Wetteravia in Germany. No less than eight species\r\nof smilax, a monocotyledonous genus, occur at Œningen and in other\r\nUpper Miocene localities, the flowers of some of them, as well as the\r\nleaves, being preserved; as in the case of the very common fossil, _S.\r\nsagittifera_, Fig. 142, _a._\r\n\r\nLeaves of plants supposed to belong to the order Proteaceæ have been\r\nobtained partly from Œningen and partly from the lacustrine formation\r\nof the same age at Locle in the Jura. They have been referred to the\r\ngenera _Banksia, Grevillea, Hakea,_ and _Persoonia._ Of Hakea there is\r\nthe impression of a supposed seed-vessel, with its characteristic thick\r\nstalk and seeds, but as the fruit is without structure, and has not yet\r\nbeen found attached to the same stem as the leaf, the proof is\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\nFig. 142: Smilax sagittifera.\r\nTo whatever family the foliage hitherto regarded as proteaceous by many\r\nable palæontologists may eventually be shown to belong, we must be\r\ncareful not to question their affinity to that order of plants on those\r\ngeographical considerations which have influenced some botanists. The\r\nnearest living Proteaceæ now feel the in Abyssinia in lat. 20° N., but\r\nthe greatest number are confined to the Cape and Australia. The\r\nancestors, however, of the Œningen fossils ought not to be looked for\r\nin such distant regions, but from that European land which in Lower\r\nMiocene times bore trees with similar foliage, and these had doubtless\r\nan Eocene source, for cones admitted by all botanists to be proteaceous\r\nhave been met with in one division of that older Tertiary group (see\r\nFig. 206). The source of these last, again, must not be sought in the\r\nantipodes, for in the white chalk of Aix-la-Chapelle leaves like those\r\nof Grevillea and other proteaceous genera have been found in abundance,\r\nand, as we shall see (p. 304) in a most perfect state of preservation.\r\nAll geologists agree that the distribution of the Cretaceous land and\r\nsea had scarcely any connection with the present geography of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nFig. 143: Fruit of the fossil and recent species of Hakea, a genus of\r\nProteaceæ.\r\n\r\nIn the same beds with the supposed Proteaceæ there occurs at Locle a\r\nfan-palm of the American type Sabal (for genus see Fig. 151), a genus\r\nwhich ranges throughout the low country near the sea from the Carolinas\r\nto Florida and Louisiana. Among the Coniferæ of Upper Miocene age is\r\nfound a deciduous cypress nearly allied to the _Taxodium distichum_ of\r\nNorth America, and a _Glyptostrobus_ (Fig. 144), very like the Japanese\r\n_G. heterophyllus,_ now common in our shrubberies.\r\n\r\nFig. 144: Glyptostrobus Europæus.\r\nBefore the appearance of Heer’s work on the Miocene Flora of\r\nSwitzerland, Unger and Goppert had already pointed out the large\r\nproportion of living North American genera which distinguished the\r\nvegetation of the Miocene period in Central Europe. Next in number,\r\nsays Heer, to these American forms at Œningen the European genera\r\npreponderate, the Asiatic ranking in the third, the African in the\r\nfourth, and the Australian in the fifth degree. The American forms are\r\nmore numerous than in the Italian Pliocene flora, and the whole\r\nvegetation indicates a warmer climate than the Pliocene, though not so\r\nhigh a temperature as that of the older or Lower Miocene period.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions drawn from the insects are for the most part in perfect\r\nharmony with those derived from the plants, but they have a somewhat\r\nless tropical and less American aspect, the South European types being\r\nmore numerous. On the whole, the insect fauna is richer than that now\r\ninhabiting any part of Europe. No less than 844 species are reckoned by\r\nHeer from the Œningen beds alone, the number of specimens which he has\r\nexamined being 5080. The entire list of Swiss species from the Upper\r\nand Lower Miocene together amount to 1322. Almost all the living\r\nfamilies of Coleoptera are represented, but, as we might have\r\nanticipated from the preponderance of arborescent and ligneous plants,\r\nthe wood-eating beetles play the most conspicuous part, the Buprestidæ\r\nand other long-horned beetles being particularly abundant.\r\n\r\nThe patterns and some remains of the colours both of _ Coleoptera_ and\r\n_Hemiptera_ are preserved at Œningen, as, for example in _Harpactor_\r\n(Fig. 145), in which the antennæ, one of the eyes, and the legs and\r\nwings are retained. The characters, indeed, of many of the insects are\r\nso well defined as to incline us to believe that if this class of the\r\ninvertebrata were not so rare and local, they might be more useful than\r\neven the plants and shells in settling chronological points in geology.\r\n\r\nMiddle or Marine Molasse (Upper Miocene) of Switzerland.—It was before\r\nstated that the Miocene formation of Switzerland consisted of, first,\r\nthe upper fresh-water molasse, comprising the lacustrine marls of\r\nŒningen; secondly, the marine molasse, corresponding in age to the\r\nfaluns of Touraine; and thirdly, the lower fresh-water molasse. Some of\r\nthe beds of the marine or middle series reach a height of 2470 feet\r\nabove the sea. A large number of the shells are common to the faluns of\r\nTouraine, the Vienna basin, and other Upper Miocene localities. The\r\nterrestrial plants play a subordinate part in the fossiliferous beds,\r\nyet more than ninety of them are enumerated by Heer as belonging to\r\nthis falunian division, and of these more than half are common to\r\nsubjacent Lower Miocene beds, while a proportion of about forty-five in\r\none hundred are common to the overlying Œningen flora. Twenty-six of\r\nthe ninety-two species are peculiar.\r\n\r\nFig. 145: Harpactor maculipes.\r\n\r\nFig. 146: Olica Dufresnii.\r\n\r\nUpper Miocene of the Bolderberg, in Belgium.—In a small hill or ridge\r\ncalled the Bolderberg, which I visited in 1851, situated near Hasselt,\r\nabout forty miles E.N.E. of Brussels, strata of sand and gravel occur,\r\nto which M. Dumont first called attention as appearing to constitute a\r\nnorthern representative of the faluns of Touraine. On the whole, they\r\nare very distinct in their fossils from the two upper divisions of the\r\nAntwerp Crag before mentioned (p. 204), and contain shells of the\r\ngenera _Oliva, Conus, Ancillaria, Pleurotoma,_ and _ Cancellaria_ in\r\nabundance. The most common shell is an Olive (Fig. 146), called by Nyst\r\n_Oliva Dufresnii_; and constituting, as M. Bosquet observes, a smaller\r\nand shorter variety of the Bordeaux species.\r\n\r\nSo far as the shells of the Bolderberg are known, the proportion of\r\nrecent species agrees with that in the faluns of Touraine, and the\r\nclimate must have been warmer than that of the Coralline Crag of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nUpper Miocene Beds of the Vienna Basin.—In South Germany the general\r\nresemblance of the shells of the Vienna tertiary basin with those of\r\nthe faluns of Touraine has long been acknowledged. In the late Dr.\r\nHörnes’s excellent work on the fossil mollusca of that formation, we\r\nsee accurate figures of many shells, clearly of the same species as\r\nthose found in the falunian sands of Touraine.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Suess, the most ancient and purely marine of the\r\nMiocene strata in this basin consist of sands, conglomerates,\r\nlimestones, and clays, and they are inclined inward, or from the\r\nborders of the trough towards the centre, their outcropping edges\r\nrising much higher than the newer beds, whether Miocene or Pliocene,\r\nwhich overlie them, and which occupy a smaller area at an inferior\r\nelevation above the sea. M. Hornes has described no less than 500\r\nspecies of gasteropods, of which he identifies one-fifth with living\r\nspecies of the Mediterranean, Indian, or African seas, but the\r\nproportion of existing species among the lamellibranchiate bivalves\r\nexceeds this average. Among many univalves agreeing with those of\r\nAfrica on the eastern side of the Atlantic are _Cypræa sanguinolenta,\r\nBuccinum lyratum,_ and _Oliva flammulata._ In the lowest marine beds of\r\nthe Vienna basin the remains of several mammalia have been found, and\r\namong them a species of _Dinotherium_, a Mastodon of the _Trilophodon_\r\nfamily, a Rhinoceros (allied to _R. megarhinus_, Christol), also an\r\nanimal of the hog tribe, _ Listriodon_, von Meyer, and a carnivorous\r\nanimal of the canine family. The _Helix turonensis_  (Fig. 38), the\r\nmost common land shell of the French faluns, accompanies the above land\r\nanimals. In a higher member of the Vienna Miocene series are found\r\n_Dinotherium giganteum_ (Fig. 136), _Mastodon longirostris, Rhinoceros\r\nSchleiermacheri, Acerotherium incisivum,_ and _ Hippotherium gracile,_\r\nall of them equally characteristic of an Upper Miocene deposit\r\noccurring at Eppelsheim, in Hesse Darmstadt; a locality also remarkable\r\nas having furnished in latitude 49° 50′ N. the bone of a large ape of\r\nthe Gibbon kind, the most northerly example yet discovered of a\r\nquadrumanous animal.\r\n\r\nFig. 147: Amphistegina Hauerina.\r\nM. Alcide d’Orbigny has shown that the foraminifera of the Vienna basin\r\ndiffer alike from the Eocene and Pliocene species, and agree with those\r\nof the faluns, so far as the latter are known. Among the Vienna\r\nforaminifera, the genus _Amphistegina_ (Fig. 147) is very\r\ncharacteristic, and is supposed by d’Archiac to take the same place\r\namong the Rhizopods of the Upper Miocene era which the Nummulites\r\noccupy in the Eocene period.\r\n\r\nThe flora of the Vienna basin exhibits some species which have a\r\ngeneral range through the whole Miocene period, such as _Cinnamomum\r\npolymorphum_ (Fig. 138), and _C. Scheuchzeri,_ also Planera Richardi,\r\nMich., _Liquidambar europæum_ (Fig. 135) _Juglans bilinica, Cassia\r\nambigua,_ and _C. lignitum._ Among the plants common to the Upper\r\nMiocene beds of Œningen, in Switzerland, are _Platanus aceroides_ (Fig.\r\n141), _Myrica vindobonensis,_ and others.\r\n\r\nUpper Miocene Strata of Italy.—We are indebted to Signor Michelotti for\r\na valuable work on the Miocene shells of Northern Italy. Those found in\r\nthe hill called the Superga, near Turin, have long been known to\r\ncorrespond in age with the faluns of Touraine, and they contain so many\r\nspecies common to the Upper Miocene strata of Bordeaux as to lead to\r\nthe conclusion that there was a free communication between the northern\r\npart of the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay in the Upper Miocene\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nUpper Miocene Formations of Greece.—At Pikermé, near Athens, MM. Wagner\r\nand Roth have described a deposit in which they found the remains of\r\nthe genera _Mastodon, Dinotherium, Hipparion,_ two species of _Giraffe,\r\nAntelope,_ and others, some living and some extinct. With them were\r\nalso associated fossil bones of the _Semnopithecus,_ showing that here,\r\nas in the south of France, the quadrumana were characteristic of this\r\nperiod. The whole fauna attests the former extension of a vast expanse\r\nof grassy plains where we have now the broken and mountainous country\r\nof Greece; plains, which were probably united with Asia Minor,\r\nspreading over the area where the deep Ægean Sea and its numerous\r\nislands are now situated. We are indebted to M. Gaudry, who visited\r\nPikermé, for a treatise on these fossil bones, showing how many data\r\nthey contribute to the theory of a transition from the mammalia of the\r\nUpper Miocene through the Pliocene and Post-pliocene forms to those of\r\nliving genera and species.\r\n\r\nUpper Miocene of India. Siwâlik Hills.—The Siwâlik Hills lie at the\r\nsouthern foot of the Himalayan chain, rising to the height of 2000 and\r\n3000 feet. Between the Jumna and the Ganges they consist of inclined\r\nstrata of sandstone, shingle, clay, and marl. We are indebted to the\r\nindefatigable researches of Dr. Falconer and Sir Proby Cautley,\r\ncontinued for fifteen years, for the discovery in these marls and\r\nsandstones of a great variety of fossil mammalia and reptiles, together\r\nwith many fresh-water shells. Out of fifteen species of shells of the\r\ngenera _Paludina, Melania, Ampullaria,_ and _Unio,_ all are extinct or\r\nunknown species with the exception of four, which are still inhabitants\r\nof Indian rivers. Such a proportion of living to extinct mollusca\r\nagrees well with the usual character of an Upper Miocene or Falunian\r\nfauna, as observed in Touraine, or in the basin of Vienna and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe genera of mammalia point in the same direction. One of them, of the\r\ngenus _Chalicotherium_ (or _Anisodon_ of Lartet), is a pachyderm\r\nintermediate between the _Rhinoceros_ and _ Anoplothere,_ and\r\ncharacteristic of the Upper Miocene strata of Eppelsheim, and of the\r\nsouth of France. With it occurs also an extinct form of Hippopotamus,\r\ncalled Hexaprotodon, and a species of Hippotherium and pig, also two\r\nspecies of _Mastodon_, two of elephant, and three other elephantine\r\nproboscidians; none of them agreeing with any fossil forms of Europe,\r\nand being intermediate between the genera Elephas and Mastodon,\r\nconstituting the sub-genus _Stegodon_ of Falconer. With these are\r\nassociated a monkey, allied to the _Semnopithecus entellus_, now living\r\nin the Himalaya, and many ruminants. Among these last, besides the\r\ngiraffe, camel, antelope, stag, and others, we find a remarkable new\r\ntype, the _Sivatherium,_ like a gigantic four-horned deer. There are\r\nalso new forms of carnivora, both feline and canine, the _Machairodus_\r\namong the former, also hyænas, and a subursine form called the\r\nHyænarctos, and a genus allied to the otter (_Enhydriodon_), of\r\nformidable size.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe, camel, and a large ostrich may be cited as proofs that\r\nthere were formerly extensive plains where now a steep chain of hills,\r\nwith deep ravines, runs for many hundred miles east and west. Among the\r\naccompanying reptiles are several crocodiles, some of huge dimensions,\r\nand one not distinguishable, says Dr. Falconer, from a species now\r\nliving in the Ganges (_C. Gangeticus_); and there is still another\r\nsaurian which the same anatomist has identified with a species now\r\ninhabiting India. There was also an extinct species of tortoise of\r\ngigantic proportions (_Colossochelys Atlas_), the curved shell of which\r\nwas twelve feet three inches long and eight feet in diameter, the\r\nentire length of the animal being estimated at eighteen feet, and its\r\nprobable height seven feet.\r\n\r\nNumerous fossils of the Siwâlik type have also been found in Perim\r\nIsland, in the Gulf of Cambay, and among these a species of\r\n_Dinotherium,_ a genus so characteristic of the Upper Miocene period in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nOlder Pliocene and Miocene Formations in the United States.—Between the\r\nAlleghany Mountains, formed of older rocks, and the Atlantic, there\r\nintervenes, in the United States, a low region occupied principally by\r\nbeds of marl, clay, and sand, consisting of the cretaceous and tertiary\r\nformations, and chiefly of the latter. The general elevation of this\r\nplain bordering the Atlantic does not exceed 100 feet, although it is\r\nsometimes several hundred feet high. Its width in the middle and\r\nsouthern states is very commonly from 100 to 150 miles. It consists, in\r\nthe South, as in Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina, almost\r\nexclusively of Eocene deposits; but in North Carolina, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Delaware, more modern strata predominate, of the age of the\r\nEnglish Crag and faluns of Touraine.[1]\r\n\r\nFig. 148: Fulgur canaliculatus. Fig. 149: Fusus quadricostatus.\r\n\r\nIn the Virginian sands, we find in great abundance a species of Astarte\r\n(_A. undulata,_ Conrad), which resembles closely, and may possibly be a\r\nvariety of, one of the commonest fossils of the Suffolk Crag (_A.\r\nOmalii_); the other shells also, of the genera _Natica, Fissurella,\r\nArtemis, Lucina, Chama, Pectunculus,_ and _Pecten,_ are analagous to\r\nshells both of the English Crag and French faluns, although the species\r\nare almost all distinct. Out of 147 of these American fossils I could\r\nonly find thirteen species common to Europe, and these occur partly in\r\nthe Suffolk Crag, and partly in the faluns of Touraine; but it is an\r\nimportant characteristic of the American group, that it not only\r\ncontains many peculiar extinct forms, such as _Fusus quadricostatus,_\r\nSay (see Fig. 149), and _Venus tridacnoides,_ abundant in these same\r\nformations, but also some shells which, like _Fulgur carica_ of Say and\r\n_F. canaliculatus_ (see Fig. 148), _Calyptræa costata, Venus\r\nmercenaria,_ Lam., _Modiola glandula,_ Totten, and _ Pecten\r\nmagellanicus,_ Lam., are recent species, yet of forms now confined to\r\nthe western side of the Atlantic—a fact implying that some traces of\r\nthe beginning of the present geographical distribution of mollusca date\r\nback to a period as remote as that of the Miocene strata.\r\n\r\nFig. 150: Astrangia lineata.\r\nOf ten species of corals which I procured on the banks of the James\r\nRiver, one agrees generically with a coral now living on the coast of\r\nthe United States. Mr. Lonsdale regarded these corals as indicating a\r\ntemperature exceeding that of the Mediterranean, and the shells would\r\nlead to similar conclusions. Those occurring on the James River are in\r\nthe 37th degree of N. latitude, while the French faluns are in the\r\n47th; yet the forms of the American fossils would scarcely imply so\r\nwarm a climate as must have prevailed in France when the Miocene strata\r\nof Touraine originated.\r\n\r\nAmong the remains of fish in these post-eocene strata of the United\r\nStates are several large teeth of the shark family, not distinguishable\r\nspecifically from fossils of the faluns of Touraine.\r\n\r\n [1] Proceedings of the Geol. Soc., vol. iv, pt. iii, 1845, p. 547.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nLOWER MIOCENE (OLIGOCENE OF BEYRICH).\r\n\r\n\r\nLower Miocene Strata of France. — Line between Miocene and Eocene. —\r\nLacustrine Strata of Auvergne. — Fossil mammalia of the Limagne\r\nd’Auvergne. — Lower Molasse of Switzerland. — Dense Conglomerates and\r\nProofs of Subsidence. — Flora of the Lower Molasse. — American\r\nCharacter of the Flora. — Theory of a Miocene Atlantis. — Lower Miocene\r\nof Belgium. — Rupelian Clay of Hermsdorf near Berlin. — Mayence Basin.\r\n— Lower Miocene of Croatia. — Oligocene Strata of Beyrich. — Lower\r\nMiocene of Italy. — Lower Miocene of England. — Hempstead Beds. — Bovey\r\nTracey Lignites in Devonshire. — Isle of Mull Leaf-Beds. — Arctic\r\nMiocene Flora. — Disco Island. — Lower Miocene of United States. —\r\nFossils of Nebraska.\r\n\r\nLine between Miocene and Eocene Formations.—The marine faluns of the\r\nvalley of the Loire have been already described as resting in some\r\nplaces on a fresh-water tertiary limestone, fragments of which have\r\nbeen broken off and rolled on the shores and in the bed of the Miocene\r\nsea. Such pebbles are frequent at Pontlevoy on the Cher, with hollows\r\ndrilled in them in which the perforating marine shells of the Falunian\r\nperiod still remain. Such a mode of superposition implies an interval\r\nof time between the origin of the fresh-water limestone and its\r\nsubmergence beneath the waters of the Upper Miocene sea. The limestone\r\nin question forms a part of the formation called the Calcaire de la\r\nBeauce, which constitutes a large table-land between the basins of the\r\nLoire and the Seine. It is associated with marls and other deposits,\r\nsuch as may have been formed in marshes and shallow lakes in the newest\r\npart of a great delta. Beds of flint, continuous or in nodules,\r\naccumulated in these lakes, and aquatic plants called Charae, left\r\ntheir stems and seed-vessels imbedded both in the marl and flint,\r\ntogether with fresh-water and land shells. Some of the siliceous rocks\r\nof this formation are used extensively for mill-stones. The flat\r\nsummits or platforms of the hills round Paris, and large areas in the\r\nforest of Fontainebleau, as well as the Plateau de la Beauce, already\r\nalluded to, are chiefly composed of these fresh-water strata. Next to\r\nthese in the descending order are marine sands and sandstone, commonly\r\ncalled the Gres de Fontainebleau, from which a considerable number of\r\nshells, very distinct from those of the faluns, have been obtained at\r\nEtampes, south of Paris, and at Montmartre and other hills in Paris\r\nitself, or in its suburbs. At the bottom of these sands a green clay\r\noccurs, containing a small oyster, _Ostrea cyathula,_ Lam., which,\r\nalthough of slight thickness, is spread over a wide area. This clay\r\nrests immediately on the Paris gypsum, or that series of beds of gypsum\r\nand gypseous marl from which Cuvier first obtained several species of\r\nPalæotherium and other extinct mammalia.[1]\r\n\r\nAt this junction of the clay and the gypsum the majority of French\r\ngeologists have always drawn the line between the Middle and Lower\r\nTertiary, or between the Miocene and Eocene formations, regarding the\r\nFontainebleau sands and the _Ostrea cyathula_ clay as the base of the\r\nMiocene, and the gypsum, with its mammalia, as the top of the Eocene\r\ngroup. I formerly dissented from this division, but I now find that I\r\nmust admit it to be the only one which will agree with the distribution\r\nof the Miocene mammalia, while even the mollusca of the Fontainebleau\r\nsands, which were formerly supposed to present at preponderance of\r\naffinities to an Eocene fauna, have since been shown to agree more\r\nclosely with the fossils of certain deposits always regarded as Middle\r\nTertiary at Mayence and in Belgium. In fact, we are now arriving at\r\nthat stage of progress when the line, wherever it be drawn between\r\nMiocene and Eocene, will be an arbitrary one, or one of mere\r\nconvenience, as I shall have an opportunity of showing when the Upper\r\nEocene formations in the Isle of Wight are described in the sixteenth\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nLower Miocene of Central France.—Lacustrine strata, belonging, for the\r\nmost part, to the same Miocene system as the Calcaire de la Beauce, are\r\nagain met with farther south in Auvergne, Cantal, and Vélay. They\r\nappear to be the monuments of ancient lakes, which, like some of those\r\nnow existing in Switzerland, once occupied the depressions in a\r\nmountainous region, and have been each fed by one or more rivers and\r\ntorrents. The country where they occur is almost entirely composed of\r\ngranite and different varieties of granitic schist, with here and there\r\na few patches of Secondary strata, much dislocated, and which have\r\nsuffered great denudation. There are also some vast piles of volcanic\r\nmatter, the greater part of which is newer than the fresh-water strata,\r\nand is sometimes seen to rest upon them, while a small part has\r\nevidently been of contemporaneous origin. Of these igneous rocks I\r\nshall treat more particularly in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe study of these regions possesses a peculiar interest very distinct\r\nin kind from that derivable from the investigation either of the\r\nParisian or English Tertiary areas. For we are presented in Auvergne\r\nwith the evidence of a series of events of astonishing magnitude and\r\ngrandeur, by which the original form and features of the country have\r\nbeen greatly changed, yet never so far obliterated but that they may\r\nstill, in part at least, be restored in imagination. Great lakes have\r\ndisappeared—lofty mountains have been formed, by the reiterated\r\nemission of lava, preceded and followed by showers of sand and\r\nscoriæ—deep valleys have been subsequently furrowed out through masses\r\nof lacustrine and volcanic origin—at a still later date, new cones have\r\nbeen thrown up in these valleys—new lakes have been formed by the\r\ndamming up of rivers—and more than one assemblage of quadrupeds, birds,\r\nand plants, Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, have followed in succession;\r\nyet the region has preserved from first to last its geographical\r\nidentity; and we can still recall to our thoughts its external\r\ncondition and physical structure before these wonderful vicissitudes\r\nbegan, or while a part only of the whole had been completed. There was\r\nfirst a period when the spacious lakes, of which we still may trace the\r\nboundaries, lay at the foot of mountains of moderate elevation,\r\nunbroken by the bold peaks and precipices of Mont Dor, and unadorned by\r\nthe picturesque outline of the Puy de Dome, or of the volcanic cones\r\nand craters now covering the granitic platform. During this earlier\r\nscene of repose deltas were slowly formed; beds of marl and sand,\r\nseveral hundred feet thick, deposited; siliceous and calcareous rocks\r\nprecipitated from the waters of mineral springs; shells and insects\r\nimbedded, together with the remains of the crocodile and tortoise, the\r\neggs and bones of water-birds, and the skeletons of quadrupeds, most of\r\nthem of genera and species characteristic of the Miocene period. To\r\nthis tranquil condition of the surface succeeded the era of volcanic\r\neruptions, when the lakes were drained, and when the fertility of the\r\nmountainous district was probably enhanced by the igneous matter\r\nejected from below, and poured down upon the more sterile granite.\r\nDuring these eruptions, which appear to have taken place towards the\r\nclose of the Miocene epoch, and which continued during the Pliocene,\r\nvarious assemblages of quadrupeds successively inhabited the district,\r\namong which are found the genera mastodon, rhinoceros, elephant, tapir,\r\nhippopotamus, together with the ox, various kinds of deer, the bear,\r\nhyæna, and many beasts of prey which ranged the forest or pastured on\r\nthe plain, and were occasionally overtaken by a fall of burning\r\ncinders, or buried in flows of mud, such as accompany volcanic\r\neruptions. Lastly, these quadrupeds became extinct, and gave place in\r\ntheir turn to the species now existing. There are no signs, during the\r\nwhole time required for this series of events, of the sea having\r\nintervened, nor of any denudation which may not have been accomplished\r\nby currents in the different lakes, or by rivers and floods\r\naccompanying repeated earthquakes, or subterranean movements, during\r\nwhich the levels of the district have in some places been materially\r\nmodified, and perhaps the whole upraised relatively to the surrounding\r\nparts of France.\r\n\r\n_Auvergne._—The most northern of the fresh-water groups is situated in\r\nthe valley-plain of the Allier, which lies within the department of the\r\nPuy de Dome, being the tract which went formerly by the name of the\r\nLimagne d’Auvergne. The average breadth of this tract is about twenty\r\nmiles; and it is for the most part composed of nearly horizontal strata\r\nof sand, sandstone, calcareous marl, clay, and limestone, none of which\r\nobserve a fixed and invariable order of superposition. The ancient\r\nborders of the lake wherein the fresh-water strata were accumulated may\r\ngenerally be traced with precision, the granite and other ancient rocks\r\nrising up boldly from the level country. The actual junction, however,\r\nof the lacustrine beds and the granite is rarely seen, as a small\r\nvalley usually intervenes between them. The fresh-water strata may\r\nsometimes be seen to retain their horizontality within a very slight\r\ndistance of the border-rocks, while in some places they are inclined,\r\nand in few instances vertical. The principal divisions into which the\r\nlacustrine series may be separated are the following:—first, Sandstone,\r\ngrit, and conglomerate, including red marl and red sandstone; secondly,\r\nGreen and white foliated marls; thirdly, Limestone, or travertin, often\r\noolitic in structure; fourthly, Gypseous marls.\r\n\r\nThe relations of these different groups cannot be learnt by the study\r\nof any one section; and the geologist who sets out with the expectation\r\nof finding a fixed order of succession may perhaps complain that the\r\ndifferent parts of the basin give contradictory results. The arenaceous\r\ndivision, the marls, and the limestone may all be seen in some places\r\nto alternate with each other; yet it can by no means be affirmed that\r\nthere is no order of arrangement. The sands, sandstone, and\r\nconglomerate constitute in general a littoral group; the foliated white\r\nand green marl, a contemporaneous central deposit more than 700 feet\r\nthick, and thinly foliated, a character which often arises from the\r\ninnumerable thin shells or carapace valves shed by the small crustacean\r\ncalled _Cypris_ in the ancient lakes of Auvergne; and lastly the\r\nlimestone is for the most part subordinate to the newer portions of\r\nboth the above formations.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, when the ancient lake of the Limagne first began to be\r\nfilled with sediment, no volcanic action had yet produced lava and\r\nscoriæ on any part of the surface of Auvergne. No pebbles, therefore,\r\nof lava were transported into the lake—no fragments of volcanic rocks\r\nimbedded in the conglomerate. But at a later period, when a\r\nconsiderable thickness of sandstone and marl had accumulated, eruptions\r\nbroke out, and lava and tuff were deposited, at some spots, alternately\r\nwith the lacustrine strata. It is not improbable that cold and thermal\r\nsprings, holding different mineral ingredients in solution, became more\r\nnumerous during the successive convulsions attending this development\r\nof volcanic agency, and thus deposits of carbonate and sulphate of\r\nlime, silex, and other minerals were produced. Hence these minerals\r\npredominate in the uppermost strata. The subterranean movements may\r\nthen have continued until they altered the relative levels of the\r\ncountry, and caused the waters of the lakes to be drained off, and the\r\nfurther accumulation of regular fresh-water strata to cease.\r\n\r\nLower Miocene Mammalia of the Limagne.—It is scarcely possible to\r\ndetermine the age of the oldest part of the fresh-water series of the\r\nLimagne, large masses both of the sandy and marly strata being devoid\r\nof fossils. Some of the lowest beds may be of Upper Eocene date,\r\nalthough, according to M. Pomel, only one bone of a _Palæotherium_ has\r\nbeen discovered in Auvergne. But in Vélay, in strata containing some\r\nspecies of fossil mammalia common to the Limagne, no less than four\r\nspecies of Palæothere have been found by M. Aymard, and one of these is\r\ngenerally supposed to be identical with _Palæotherium magnum,_ an\r\nundoubted Upper Eocene fossil, of the Paris gypsum, the other three\r\nbeing peculiar.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the other mammalia of the Limagne belong undoubtedly to\r\ngenera and species elsewhere proper to the Lower Miocene. Thus, for\r\nexample, the Cainotherium of Bravard, a genus not far removed from the\r\nAnoplotherium, is represented by several species, one of which, as I\r\nlearn from Mr. Waterhouse, agrees with _Microtherium Renggeri_ of the\r\nMayence basin. In like manner, the _Amphitragulus elegans_ of Pomel, an\r\nAuvergne fossil, is identified by Waterhouse with _Dorcatherium nanum_\r\nof Kaup, a Rhenish species from Weissenau, near Mayence. A small\r\nspecies, also, of rodent, of the genus Titanomys of H. von Meyer, is\r\ncommon to the Lower Miocene of Mayence and the Limagne d’Auvergne, and\r\nthere are many other points of agreement which the discordance of\r\nnomenclature tends to conceal. A remarkable carnivorous genus, the\r\nHyænodon of Laizer, is represented by more than one species. The same\r\ngenus has also been found in the Upper Eocene marls of Hordwell Cliff,\r\nHampshire, just below the level of the Bembridge Limestone, and\r\ntherefore a formation older than the Gypsum of Paris. Several species\r\nof opossum (_Didelphis_) are met with in the same strata of the\r\nLimagne. The total number of mammalia enumerated by M. Pomel as\r\nappertaining to the Lower Miocene fauna of the Limagne and Velay falls\r\nlittle short of a hundred, and with them are associated some large\r\ncrocodiles and tortoises, and some Ophidian and Batrachian reptiles.\r\n\r\nLower Molasse of Switzerland.—The two upper divisions of the Swiss\r\nMolasse—the one fresh-water, the other marine—have already been\r\ndescribed in the preceding chapter. I shall now proceed to treat of the\r\nthird division, which is of Lower Miocene age. Nearly the whole of this\r\nLower Molasse is fresh-water, yet some of the inferior beds contain a\r\nmixture of marine and fluviatile shells, the _Cerithium margaritaceum,_\r\na well-known Lower Miocene fossil, being one of the marine species.\r\nNotwithstanding, therefore, that some of these Lower Miocene strata\r\nconsist of old shingle-beds several thousand feet in thickness, as in\r\nthe Rigi, near Lucerne, and in the Speer, near Wesen, mountains 5000\r\nand 7000 feet above the sea, the deposition of the whole series must\r\nhave begun at or below the sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerates, as might be expected, are often very unequal in\r\nthickness, in closely adjoining districts, since in a littoral\r\nformation accumulations of pebbles would swell out in certain places\r\nwhere rivers entered the sea, and would thin out to comparatively small\r\ndimensions where no streams or only small ones came down to the coast.\r\nFor ages, in spite of a gradual depression of the land and adjacent\r\nsea-bottom, the rivers continued to cover the sinking area with their\r\ndeltas; until finally, the subsidence being in excess, the sea of the\r\nMiddle Molasse gained upon the land, and marine beds were thrown down\r\nover the dense mass of fresh-water and brackish-water deposit, called\r\nthe Lower Molasse, which had previously accumulated.\r\n\r\nFlora of the Lower Molasse.—In part of the Swiss Molasse, which belongs\r\nexclusively to the Lower Miocene period, the number of plants has been\r\nestimated at more than 500 species, somewhat exceeding those which were\r\nbefore enumerated as occurring in the two upper divisions. The Swiss\r\nLower Miocene may best be studied on the northern borders of the Lake\r\nof Geneva, between Lausanne and Vevay, where the contiguous villages of\r\nMonod and Rivaz are situated. The strata there, which I have myself\r\nexamined, consist of alternations of conglomerate, sandstone, and\r\nfinely laminated marls with fossil plants. A small stream falls in a\r\nsuccession of cascades over the harder beds of pudding-stone, which\r\nresist, while the sandstone and plant-bearing shales and marls give\r\nway. From the latter no less than 193 species of plants have been\r\nobtained by the exertions of MM. Heer and Gaudin, and they are\r\nconsidered to afford a true type of the vegetation of the Lower Miocene\r\nformations of Switzerland—a vegetation departing farther in its\r\ncharacter from that now flourishing in Europe than any of the higher\r\nmembers of the series before alluded to, and yet displaying so much\r\naffinity to the flora of Œningen as to make it natural for the botanist\r\nto refer the whole to one and the same Miocene period. There are,\r\nindeed, no less than 81 species of these Older Miocene plants which\r\npass up into the flora of Œningen.\r\n\r\nThis fact is important as bearing on the propriety of classing the\r\nLower Molasse of Switzerland as belonging to the Miocene rather than to\r\nthe latter part of the Eocene period. There are, indeed, so many types\r\namong the fossils, both specific and generic, which have a wide range\r\nthrough the whole of the Molasse, that a unity of character is thereby\r\nstamped on the whole flora, in spite of the contrast between the plants\r\nof the uppermost and lowest formations, or between Oeningen and Monod.\r\nThe proofs of a warmer climate, and the excess of arborescent over\r\nherbaceous plants, and of evergreen trees over deciduous species, are\r\ncharacters common to the whole flora, but which are intensified as we\r\ndescend to the inferior deposits.\r\n\r\nNearly all the plants at Monod are contained in three layers of marl\r\nseparated by two of soft sandstone. The thickness of the marls is ten\r\nfeet, and vegetable matter predominates so much in some layers as to\r\nform an imperfect lignite. One bed is filled with large leaves of a\r\nspecies of fig (_Ficus populina_), and of a hornbeam (_Carpinus\r\ngrandis_), the strength of the wind having probably been great when\r\nthey were blown into the lake; whereas another contiguous layer\r\ncontains almost exclusively smaller leaves, indicating, apparently, a\r\ndiminished strength in the wind. Some of the upper beds at Monod abound\r\nin leaves of Proteaceæ, Cyperaceæ, and ferns, while in some of the\r\nlower ones _Sequoia, Cinnamomum,_ and _Sparganium_ are common. In one\r\nbed of sandstone the trunk of a large palm-tree was found unaccompanied\r\nby other fossils, and near Vevay, in the same series of Lower Miocene\r\nstrata, the leaves of a palm of the genus _Sabal_ (Fig. 151), a genus\r\nnow proper to America, were obtained.\r\n\r\nFig. 151: Sabal major\r\nAmong other genera of the same class is a _Flabellaria_ occurring near\r\nLausanne, and a magnificent _Phœnicites_ allied to the date palm. When\r\nthese plants flourished the climate must have been much hotter than\r\nnow. The Alps were no doubt much lower, and the palms now found fossil\r\nin strata elevated 2000 feet above the sea grew nearly at the\r\nsea-level, as is demonstrated by the brackish-water character of some\r\nof the beds into which they were carried by winds or rivers from the\r\nadjoining coast.\r\n\r\nIn the same plant-bearing deposits of the Lower Molasse in Switzerland\r\nleaves have been found which have been ascribed to the order Proteaceæ\r\nalready spoken of as well represented in the Œningen beds (see p. 221).\r\nThe Proteas and other plants of this family now flourish at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope; while the Banksias, and a set of genera distinct from those\r\nof Africa, grow most luxuriantly in the southern and temperate parts of\r\nAustralia. They were probably inhabitants, says Heer, of dry hilly\r\nground, and the stiff leathery character of their leaves must have been\r\nfavourable to their preservation, allowing them to float on a river for\r\ngreat distances without being injured, and then to sink, when\r\nwater-logged, to the bottom. It has been objected that the fruit of the\r\nProteaceæ is of so tough and enduring a texture that it ought to have\r\nbeen more commonly met with; but in the first place we must not forget\r\nthe numerous cones found in the Eocene strata of Sheppey, which all\r\nadmit to be proteaceous and to belong to at least two species (see p.\r\n222). Secondly, besides the fruit of Hakea before mentioned (p. 221),\r\nHeer found associated with fossil leaves, having the exact form and\r\nnervation of Banksia, fruit precisely such as may have come from a cone\r\nof that plant, and lately he has received another similar fruit from\r\nthe Lower Miocene strata of Lucerne. They may have fallen out of a\r\ndecayed cone in the same way as often happens to the seeds of the\r\nspruce fir, _Pinus abies,_ found scattered over the ground in our\r\nwoods. It is a known fact that among the living Proteaceæ the cones are\r\nvery firmly attached to the branches, so that the seeds drop out\r\nwithout the cone itself falling to the ground, and this may perhaps be\r\nthe reason why, in some instances in which fossil seeds have been\r\nfound, no traces of the cone have been observed.\r\n\r\nFig. 152: Fruit of fossil Banksia and leaf of Banksia. Fig. 153:\r\nSequoia Langsdorfii.\r\n\r\nAmong the Coniferæ the Sequoia here figured is common at Rivaz, and is\r\none of the most universal plants in the Lowest Miocene of Switzerland,\r\nwhile it also characterises the Miocene Brown Coals of Germany and\r\ncertain beds of the Val d’Arno, which I have called Older Pliocene, p.\r\n208.\r\n\r\nFig. 154: Lastræa stiriaca.\r\nAmong the ferns met with in profusion at Monod is the _ Lastræa\r\nstiriaca,_ Unger, which has a wide range in the Miocene period from\r\nstrata of the age of Œningen to the lowest part of the Swiss Molasse.\r\nIn some specimens, as shown in Fig. 154, the fructification is\r\ndistinctly seen.\r\n\r\nAmong the laurels several species of _Cinnamomum_ are very conspicuous.\r\nBesides the _C. polymorphum,_ before figured, p. 219, another species\r\nalso ranges from the Lower to the Upper Molasse of Switzerland, and is\r\nvery characteristic of different deposits of Brown Coal in Germany. It\r\nhas been called _Cinnamomum Rossmässleri_ by Heer (see Fig. 155). The\r\nleaves are easily recognised as having two side veins, which run up\r\nuninterruptedly to their point.\r\n\r\nFig. 155: Cinnamomum Rossmässleri.\r\nAmerican Character of the Flora.—If we consider not merely the number\r\nof species but those plants which constitute the mass of the Lower\r\nMiocene vegetation, we find the European part of the fossil flora very\r\nmuch less prominent than in the Œningen beds, while the foreground is\r\noccupied by American forms, by evergreen oaks, maples, poplars, planes,\r\nLiquidambar, Robinia, Sequoia, Taxodium, and ternate-leaved pines.\r\nThere is also a much greater fusion of the characters now belonging to\r\ndistinct botanical provinces than in the Upper Miocene flora, and we\r\nshall find this fusion still more strikingly exemplified as we go back\r\nto the antecedent Eocene and Cretaceous periods.\r\n\r\nProfessor Heer has advocated the doctrine, first advanced by Unger to\r\nexplain the large number of American genera in the Miocene flora of\r\nEurope, that the present basin of the Atlantic was occupied by land\r\nover which the Miocene flora could pass freely. But other able\r\nbotanists have shown that it is far more probable that the American\r\nplants came from the east and not from the west, and instead of\r\nreaching Europe by the shortest route over an imaginary Atlantis,\r\nmigrated in an opposite direction, crossing the whole of Asia.\r\n\r\nArctic Miocene Flora.—But when we indulge in speculations as to the\r\ngeographical origin of the Miocene plants of Central Europe, we must\r\ntake into account the discoveries recently made of a rich terrestrial\r\nflora having flourished in the Arctic Regions in the Miocene period\r\nfrom which many species may have migrated from a common centre so as to\r\nreach the present continents of Europe, Asia, and America. Professor\r\nHeer has examined the various collections of fossil plants that have\r\nbeen obtained in North Greenland (lat. 70°), Iceland, Spitzbergen, and\r\nother parts of the Arctic regions, and has determined that they are of\r\nMiocene age and indicate a temperate climate.[2] Including the\r\ncollections recently brought from Greenland by Mr. Whymper, the Arctic\r\nMiocene flora now comprises 194 species, and that of Greenland 137\r\nspecies, of which 46, or exactly one-third, are identical with plants\r\nfound in the Miocene beds of Central Europe. Considerably more than\r\nhalf the number are trees, which is the more remarkable since, at the\r\npresent day, trees do not exist in any part of Greenland even 10\r\ndegrees farther south.\r\n\r\nMore than thirty species of Coniferæ have been found, including several\r\nSequoias (allied to the gigantic Wellingtonia of California), with\r\nspecies of Thujopsis and Salisburia now peculiar to Japan. There are\r\nalso beeches, oaks, planes, poplars, maples, walnuts, limes, and even a\r\nmagnolia, two cones of which have recently been obtained, proving that\r\nthis splendid evergreen not only lived but ripened its fruit within the\r\nArctic circle. Many of the limes, planes, and oaks were large-leaved\r\nspecies, and both flowers and fruit, besides immense quantities of\r\nleaves, are in many cases preserved. Among the shrubs were many\r\nevergreens, as _ Andromeda,_ and two extinct genera, _Daphnogene_ and _\r\nM’Clintockia,_ with fine leathery leaves, together with hazel,\r\nblackthorn, holly, logwood, and hawthorn. A species of Zamia\r\n(_Zamites_) grew in the swamps, with _Potamogeton, Sparganium,_ and\r\n_Menyanthes,_ while ivy and vines twined around the forest trees and\r\nbroad-leaved ferns grew beneath their shade. Even in Spitzbergen, as\r\nfar north as latitude 78° 56′, no less than ninety-five species of\r\nfossil plants have been obtained, including _Taxodium_ of two species,\r\nhazel, poplar, alder, beech, plane-tree, and lime. Such a vigorous\r\ngrowth of trees within 12 degrees of the pole, where now a dwarf willow\r\nand a few herbaceous plants form the only vegetation, and where the\r\nground is covered with almost perpetual snow and ice, is truly\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nThe identity of so many of the fossils with Miocene species of Central\r\nEurope and Italy not only proves that the climate of Greenland was much\r\nwarmer than it is now, but also renders it probable that a much more\r\nuniform climate prevailed over the entire northern hemisphere. This is\r\nalso indicated by the whole character of the Upper Miocene flora of\r\nCentral Europe, which does not necessitate a mean temperature very much\r\ngreater than exists at present, if we suppose such absence of winter\r\ncold as is proper to insular climates. Professor Heer believes that the\r\nmean temperature of North Greenland must have been at least 30 degrees\r\nhigher than at present, while an addition of 10 degrees to the mean\r\ntemperature of Central Europe would probably be as much as was\r\nrequired. The chief locality where this wonderful flora is preserved is\r\nat Atanekerdluk in North Greenland (lat. 70°), on a hill at an\r\nelevation of about 1200 feet above the sea. There is here a\r\nconsiderable succession of sedimentary strata pierced by volcanic\r\nrocks. Fossil plants occur in all the beds, and the erect trunks as\r\nthick as a man’s body which are sometimes found, together with the\r\nabundance of specimens of flowers and fruit in good preservation,\r\nsufficiently prove that the plants grew where they are now found. At\r\nDisco island and other localities on the same part of the coast, good\r\ncoal is abundant, interstratified with beds of sandstone, in some of\r\nwhich fossil plants have also been found, similar to those at\r\nAtanekerdluk.\r\n\r\nFig. 156: Leda (Nucula) Deshayesiana. Lower Miocene, Belgium.—The Upper\r\nMiocene Bolderberg beds, mentioned in p. 224, rest on a Lower Miocene\r\nformation called the Rupelian of Dumont. This formation is best seen at\r\nthe villages of Rupelmonde and Boom, ten miles south of Antwerp, on the\r\nbanks of the Scheldt and near the junction with it of a small stream\r\ncalled the Rupel. A stiff clay abounding in fossils is extensively\r\nworked at the above localities for making tiles. It attains a thickness\r\nof about 100 feet, and though very different in age, much resembles in\r\nmineral character the “London clay,” containing, like it, septaria or\r\nconcretions of argillaceous limestone traversed by cracks in the\r\ninterior, which are filled with calc-spar. The shells, referable to\r\nabout forty species, have been described by MM. Nyst and De Koninck.\r\nAmong them _Leda_ (or Nucula) _Deshayesiana_ (see Fig. 156) is by far\r\nthe most abundant; a fossil unknown as yet in the English tertiary\r\nstrata, but when young much resembling Leda amygdaloides of the London\r\nClay proper (see Fig. 213). Among other characteristic shells are\r\n_Pecten Hœninghausii,_ and a species of _ Cassidaria,_ and several of\r\nthe genus _Pleurotoma._ Not a few of these testacea agree with English\r\nEocene species, such as _Actæon simulatus,_ Sowb, _Cancellaria evulsa,_\r\nBrander, _Corbula pisum_ (Fig. 157), and _Nautilus (Aturia) ziczac._\r\nThey are accompanied by many teeth of sharks, as _Lamna contortidens,_\r\nAg., _ Oxyrhinaxiphodon,_ Ag., _Carcharodon angustidens_ (see Fig.\r\n196), Ag., and other fish, some of them common to the Middle Eocene\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n_Kleyn Spawen beds._—The succession of the Lower Miocene strata of\r\nBelgium can be best studied in the environs of Kleyn Spawen, a village\r\nsituated about seven miles west of Maestricht, in the old province of\r\nLimburg in Belgium. In that region, about 200 species of testacea,\r\nmarine and fresh-water, have been obtained, with many foraminifera and\r\nremains of fish. In none of the Belgian Lower Miocene strata could I\r\nfind any nummulites; and M. d’Archiac had previously observed that\r\nthese foraminifera characterise his “Lower Tertiary Series,” as\r\ncontrasted with the Middle, and they therefore serve as a good test of\r\nage between Eocene and Miocene, at least in Belgium and the North of\r\nFrance.[3] Between the Bolderberg beds and the Rupelian clay there is a\r\ngreat gap in Belgium, which seems, according to M. Beyrich, to be\r\nfilled up in the North of Germany by what he calls the Sternberg beds,\r\nand which, had Dumont found them in Belgium, he might probably have\r\ntermed Upper Rupelian.\r\n\r\nLower Miocene of Germany.—_Rupelian Clay of Hermsdorf, near\r\nBerlin._—Professor Beyrich has described a mass of clay, used for\r\nmaking tiles, within seven miles of the gates of Berlin, near the\r\nvillage of Hermsdorf, rising up from beneath the sands with which that\r\ncountry is chiefly overspread. This clay is more than forty feet thick,\r\nof a dark bluish-grey colour, and, like that of Rupelmonde, contains\r\nseptaria. Among other shells, the _Leda Deshayesiana,_ before mentioned\r\n(Fig. 156), abounds, together with many species of _ Pleurotoma,\r\nVoluta,_ etc., a certain proportion of the fossils being identical in\r\nspecies with those of Rupelmonde.\r\n\r\n_Mayence Basin._—An elaborate description has been published by Dr. F.\r\nSandberger of the Mayence tertiary area, which occupies a tract from\r\nfive to twelve miles in breadth, extending for a great distance along\r\nthe left bank of the Rhine from Mayence to the neighbourhood of\r\nManheim, and which is also found to the east, north, and south-west of\r\nFrankfort. M. De Koninck, of Liege, first pointed out to me that the\r\npurely marine portion of the deposit contained many species of shells\r\ncommon to the Kleyn Spawen beds, and to the clay of Rupelmonde, near\r\nAntwerp. Among these he mentioned _Cassidaria depressa, Tritonium\r\nargutum,_ Brander (_T. flandricum,_ De Koninck), _ Tornatella simulata,\r\nAporrhais Sowbyi, Leda Deshayesiana_ (Fig. 156), _Corbula pisum,_ (Fig.\r\n158) and others.\r\n\r\nLower Miocene Beds of Croatia.—The Brown Coal of Radaboj, near Angram\r\nin Croatia, not far from the borders of Styria, is covered, says Von\r\nBuch, by beds containing the marine shells of the Vienna basin, or, in\r\nother words, by Upper Miocene or Falunian strata. They appear to\r\ncorrespond in age to the Mayence basin, or to the Rupelian strata of\r\nBelgium. They have yielded more than 200 species of fossil plants,\r\ndescribed by the late Professor Unger. These plants are well preserved\r\nin a hard marlstone, and contain several palms; among them the Sabal,\r\nFig. 151, p. 237, and another genus allied to the date-palm _\r\nPhœnicites spectabilis._ The only abundant plant among the Radaboj\r\nfossils which is characteristic of the Upper Miocene period is the\r\n_Populus mutabilis,_ whereas no less than fifty of the Radaboj species\r\nare common to the more ancient flora of the Lower Molasse of\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nFig. 157: Vanessa Pluto.\r\n\r\nThe insect fauna is very rich, and, like the plants, indicates a more\r\ntropical climate than do the fossils of Œningen presently to be\r\nmentioned. There are ten species of Termites, or white ants, some of\r\ngigantic size, and large dragon-flies with speckled wings, like those\r\nof the Southern States in North America; there are also grasshoppers of\r\nconsiderable size, and even the Lepidoptera are not unrepresented. In\r\none instance, the pattern of a butterfly’s wing has escaped\r\nobliteration in the marl-stone of Radaboj; and when we reflect on the\r\nremoteness of the time from which it has been faithfully transmitted to\r\nus, this fact may inspire the reader with some confidence as to the\r\nreliable nature of the characters which other insects of a more durable\r\ntexture, such as the beetles, may afford for specific determination.\r\nThe Vanessa above figured retains, says Heer, some of its colours, and\r\ncorresponds with _V. Hadena_ of India.\r\n\r\nProfessor Beyrich has made known to us the existence of a long\r\nsuccession of marine strata in North Germany, which lead by an almost\r\ngradual transition from beds of Upper Miocene age to others of the age\r\nof the base of the Lower Miocene. Although some of the German lignites\r\ncalled Brown Coal belong to the upper parts of this series, the most\r\nimportant of them are of Lower Miocene date, as, for example, those of\r\nthe Siebengebirge, near Bonn, which are associated with volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Beyrich confines the term “Miocene” to those strata which\r\nagree in age with the faluns of Touraine, and he has proposed the term\r\n“Oligocene” for those older formations called Lower Miocene in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nLower Miocene of Italy.—In the hills of which the Superga forms a part\r\nthere is a great series of Tertiary strata which pass downward into the\r\nLower Miocene. Even in the Superga itself there are some fossil plants\r\nwhich, according to Heer, have never been found in Switzerland so high\r\nas the marine Molasse, such as _Banksia longifolia,_ and _Carpinus\r\ngrandis._ In several parts of the Ligurian Apennines, as at Dégo and\r\nCarcare, the Lower Miocene appears, containing some nummulites, and at\r\nCadibona, north of Savona, fresh-water strata of the same age occur,\r\nwith dense beds of lignite inclosing remains of the _ Anthracotherium\r\nmagnum_ and _A. minimum,_ besides other mammalia enumerated by\r\nGastaldi. In these beds a great number of the Lower Miocene plants of\r\nSwitzerland have been discovered.\r\n\r\nLower Miocene of England—Hempstead Beds.—We have already stated that\r\nthe Upper Miocene formation is nowhere represented in the British\r\nIsles; but strata referable to the Lower Miocene period are found both\r\nin England, Scotland, and Ireland. In the Hampshire basin these occupy\r\na very small superficial area, having been discovered by the late\r\nEdward Forbes at Hempstead near Yarmouth, in the northern part of the\r\nIsle of Wight, where they are 170 feet thick, and rich in\r\ncharacteristic marine shells. They overlie the uppermost of an\r\nextensive series of Eocene deposits of marine, brackish, and\r\nfresh-water formations, which rest on the Chalk and terminate upward in\r\nstrata corresponding in age to the Paris gypsum, and containing the\r\nsame extinct genera of quadrupeds, _Palæotherium, Anoplotherium,_ and\r\nothers which Cuvier first described. The following is the succession of\r\nthese Lower Miocene strata, most of them exposed in a cliff east of\r\nYarmouth:\r\n\r\n1. The uppermost or Corbula beds, consisting of marine sands and clays,\r\ncontain _Voluta Rathieri,_ a characteristic Lower Miocene shell;\r\n_Corbula pisum_ (Fig. 158), a species common to the Upper Eocene clay\r\nof Barton; Cyrena semistriata (Fig. 159), several Cerithia, and other\r\nshells peculiar to this series.\r\n\r\nFig. 158: Corbula pisum. Fig. 159: Cyrena semistriata. Fig. 160:\r\nCerithium plicatum. Fig. 161: Cerithium elegans. Fig. 162: Rissoa\r\nChastelii. Fig. 163: Paludina lenta.\r\n\r\n2. Next are fresh-water and estuary marls and carbonaceous clays in the\r\nbrackish-water portion of which are found abundantly _ Cerithium\r\nplicatum,_ Lam. (Fig. 160), _Cerithium elegans_ (Fig. 161), and\r\n_Cerithium tricinctum_; also _Rissoa Chastelii_ (Fig. 162), a very\r\ncommon Kleyn Spawen shell, and which occurs in each of the four\r\nsubdivisions of the Hempstead series down to its base, where it passes\r\ninto the Bembridge beds. In the fresh-water portion of the same beds\r\n_Paludina lenta_ (Fig. 163) occurs; a shell identified by some\r\nconchologists with a species now living, _P. unicolor_; also several\r\nspecies of _ Lymneus, Planorbis,_ and _Unio._\r\n\r\n3. The next series, or middle fresh-water and estuary marls, are\r\ndistinguished by the presence of _Melania fasciata, Paludina lenta,_\r\nand clays with _Cypris_; the lowest bed contains _Cyrena semistriata_\r\n(Fig. 159), mingled with Cerithia and a _panopæa._\r\n\r\n4. The lower fresh-water and estuary marls contain _Melania costata,_\r\nSowerby, _Melanopsis,_ etc. The bottom bed is carbonaceous, and called\r\nthe “Black band,” in which _ Rissoa Chastelii_ (Fig. 162), before\r\nalluded to, is common. This bed contains a mixture of Hempstead shells\r\nwith those of the underlying Upper Eocene or Bembridge series. The\r\nmammalia, among which is _Hyopotamus bovinus,_ differ, so far as they\r\nare known, from those of the Bembridge beds. Among the plants,\r\nProfessor Heer has recognised four species common to the lignite of\r\nBovey Tracey, a Lower Miocene formation presently to be described:\r\nnamely, _Sequoia Couttsiæ,_ Heer; _Andromeda reticulata,_ Ettings.;\r\n_Nelumbium (Nymphœa) doris,_ Heer; and _Carpolithes Websteri,_\r\nBrong.[4] The seed-vessels of _Chara medicaginula,_ Brong, and _C.\r\nhelicteres_ are characteristic of the Hempstead beds generally.\r\n\r\nThe _Hyopotamus_ belongs to the hog tribe, or the same family as the\r\nAnthracotherium, of which seven species, varying in size from the\r\nhippopotamus to the wild boar, have been found in Italy and other part\r\nof Europe associated with the lignites of the Lower Miocene period.\r\n\r\nLignites and Clays of Bovey Tracey, Devonshire.—Surrounded by the\r\ngranite and other rocks of the Dartmoor hills in Devonshire, is a\r\nformation of clay, sand, and lignite, long known to geologists as the\r\nBovey Coal formation, respecting the age of which, until the year 1861,\r\nopinions were very unsettled. This deposit is situated at Bovey Tracey,\r\na village distant eleven miles from Exeter in a south-west, and about\r\nas far from Torquay in a north-west direction. The strata extend over a\r\nplain nine miles long, and they consist of the materials of decomposed\r\nand worn-down granite and vegetable matter, and have evidently filled\r\nup an ancient hollow or lake-like expansion of the valleys of the Bovey\r\nand Teign.\r\n\r\nThe lignite is of bad quality for economical purposes, as there is a\r\ngreat admixture in it of iron pyrites, and it emits a sulphurous odour,\r\nbut it has been successfully applied to the baking of pottery, for\r\nwhich some of the fine clays are well adapted. Mr. Pengelly has\r\nconfirmed Sir H. De la Beche’s opinion that much of the upper portion\r\nof this old lacustrine formation has been removed by denudation.[5]\r\n\r\nAt the surface is a dense covering of clay and gravel with angular\r\nstones probably of the Post-pliocene period, for in the clay are three\r\nspecies of willow and the dwarf birch, _Betula nana,_ indicating a\r\nclimate colder than that of Devonshire at the present day.\r\n\r\nBelow this are Lower Miocene strata about 300 feet in thickness, in the\r\nupper part of which are twenty-six beds of lignite, clay, and sand, and\r\nat their base a ferruginous quartzose sand, varying in thickness from\r\ntwo to twenty-seven feet. Below this sand are forty-five beds of\r\nalternating lignite and clay. No shells or bones of mammalia, and no\r\ninsect, with the exception of one fragment of a beetle (_Buprestis_);\r\nin a word, no organic remains, except plants, have as yet been found.\r\nThese plants occur in fourteen of the beds—namely, in two of the clays,\r\nand the rest in the lignites. One of the beds is a perfect mat of the\r\ndebris of a coniferous tree, called by Heer _Sequoia Couttsiæ,_\r\nintermixed with leaves of ferns. The same Sequoia (before mentioned as\r\na Hempstead fossil, p. 246) is spread through all parts of the\r\nformation, its cones, and seeds, and branches of every age being\r\npreserved. It is a species supplying a link between _Sequoia\r\nLangsdorfii_ (see Fig. 153, p. 238) and _S. Sternbergi,_ the widely\r\nspread fossil representatives of the two living trees _S. sempervirens_\r\nand _S. gigantea_ (or Wellingtonia), both now confined to California.\r\nAnother bed is full of the large rhizomes of ferns, while two others\r\nare rich in dicotyledonous leaves. In all, Professor Heer enumerates\r\nforty-nine species of plants, twenty of which are common to the Miocene\r\nbeds of the Continent, a majority of them being characteristic of the\r\nLower Miocene. The new species, also of Bovey, are allied to plants of\r\nthe older Miocene deposits of Switzerland, Germany, and other\r\nContinental countries. The grape-stones of two species of vine occur in\r\nthe clays, and leaves of the fig and seeds of a water-lily. The oak and\r\nlaurel have supplied many leaves. Of the triple-nerved laurels several\r\nare referred to Cinnamomum. There are leaves also of a palm of which\r\nthe genus is not determined. Leaves also of proteaceous forms, like\r\nsome of the Continental fossils before mentioned, occur, and ferns like\r\nthe well-known _ Lastræa stiriaca_ (Fig. 154, p. 238), displaying at\r\nBovey, as in Switzerland, its fructification.\r\n\r\nThe croziers of some of the young ferns are very perfect, and were at\r\nfirst mistaken by collectors for shells of the genus _ Planorbis._ On\r\nthe whole, the vegetation of Bovey implies the existence of a\r\nsub-tropical climate in Devonshire, in the Lower Miocene period.\r\n\r\nScotland: Isle of Mull.—In the sea-cliffs forming the headland of\r\nArdtun, on the west coast of Mull, in the Hebrides, several bands of\r\ntertiary strata containing leaves of dicotyledonous plants were\r\ndiscovered in 1851 by the Duke of Argyll.[6] From his description it\r\nappears that there are three leaf-beds, varying in thickness from 1½ to\r\n5½ feet, which are interstratified with volcanic tuff and trap, the\r\nwhole mass being about 130 feet in thickness. A sheet of basalt 40 feet\r\nthick covers the whole; and another columnar bed of the same rock, ten\r\nfeet thick, is exposed at the bottom of the cliff. One of the leaf-beds\r\nconsists of a compressed mass of leaves unaccompanied by any stems, as\r\nif they had been blown into a marsh where a species of _Equisetum_\r\ngrew, of which the remains are plentifully imbedded in clay.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by the Duke of Argyll that this formation was\r\naccumulated in a shallow lake or marsh in the neighbourhood of a\r\nvolcano, which emitted showers of ashes and streams of lava. The\r\ntufaceous envelope of the fossils may have fallen into the lake from\r\nthe air as volcanic dust, or have been washed down into it as mud from\r\nthe adjoining land. Even without the aid of organic remains we might\r\nhave decided that the deposit was newer than the chalk, for\r\nchalk-flints containing cretaceous fossils were detected by the duke in\r\nthe principal mass of volcanic ashes or tuff.[7]\r\n\r\nThe late Edward Forbes observed that some of the plants of this\r\nformation resembled those of Croatia, described by Unger, and his\r\nopinion has been confirmed by Professor Heer, who found that the\r\nconifer most prevalent was the _Sequoia Langsdorfii_ (Fig. 153, p.\r\n238), also _Corylus grossedentata,_ a Lower Miocene species of\r\nSwitzerland and of Menat in Auvergne. There is likewise a plane-tree,\r\nthe leaves of which seem to agree with those of _Platanus aceroides_\r\n(Fig. 141), and a fern which is as yet peculiar to Mull, _Filicites\r\nhebridica,_ Forbes.\r\n\r\nThese interesting discoveries in Mull led geologists to suspect that\r\nthe basalt of Antrim, in Ireland, and of the celebrated Giant’s\r\nCauseway, might be of the same age. The volcanic rocks that overlie the\r\nchalk, and some of the strata associated with and interstratified\r\nbetween masses of basalt, contain leaves of dicotyledonous plants,\r\nsomewhat imperfect, but resembling the beech, oak, and plane, and also\r\nsome coniferæ of the genera pine and Sequoia. The general dearth of\r\nstrata in the British Isles, intermediate in age between the formation\r\nof the Eocene and Pliocene periods, may arise, says Professor Forbes,\r\nfrom the extent of dry land which prevailed in that vast interval of\r\ntime. If land predominated, the only monuments we are likely ever to\r\nfind of Miocene date are those of lacustrine and volcanic origin, such\r\nas the Bovey Coal in Devonshire, the Ardtun beds in Mull, or the\r\nlignites and associated basalts in Antrim.\r\n\r\nLower Miocene, United states: Nebraska.—In the territory of Nebraska,\r\non the Upper Missouri, near the Platte River, lat. 42° N., a tertiary\r\nformation occurs, consisting of white limestone, marls, and siliceous\r\nclay, described by Dr. D. Dale Owen,[8] in which many bones of extinct\r\nquadrupeds, and of chelonians of land or fresh-water forms, are met\r\nwith. Among these, Dr. Leidy describes a gigantic quadruped, called by\r\nhim _Titanotherium,_ nearly allied to the _Palæotherium,_ but larger\r\nthan any of the species found in the Paris gypsum. With these are\r\nseveral species of the genus _Oreodon,_ Leidy, uniting the characters\r\nof pachyderms and ruminants also; _Eucrotaphus,_ another new genus of\r\nthe same mixed character; two species of rhinoceros of the sub-genus\r\n_Acerotherium,_ a Lower Miocene form of Europe before mentioned; two\r\nspecies of _Archæotherium,_ a pachyderm allied to _Chæropotamus_ and _\r\nHyracotherium_; also _Pæbrotherium,_ an extinct ruminant allied to\r\n_Dorcatherium,_ Kaup; also _ Agriochoerus,_ of Leidy, a ruminant allied\r\nto _ Merycopotamus_ of Falconer and Cautley; and, lastly, a large\r\ncarnivorous animal of the genus _Machairodus,_ the most ancient example\r\nof which in Europe occurs in the Lower Miocene strata of Auvergne, but\r\nof which some species are found in Pliocene deposits. The turtles are\r\nreferred to the genus _Testudo,_ but have some affinity to _Emys._ On\r\nthe whole, the Nebraska formation is probably newer than the Paris\r\ngypsum, and referable to the Lower Miocene period, as above defined.\r\n\r\n [1] Bulletin, 1856, Journ., vol. xii, p. 768.\r\n\r\n [2] Heer “Miocene baltische Flora” and “Fossil-flora von Alaska” 1869.\r\n\r\n [3] D’Archiac Monogr., pp. 79, 100.\r\n\r\n [4] Pengelly, preface to The Lignite Formation of Bovey Tracey, p.\r\n xvii, London, 1863.\r\n\r\n [5] Philos.

When this map was constructed I classed as\r\nthe newer part of the Eocene those Tertiary strata which have been\r\ndescribed in the last chapter as Lower Miocene, and to which M. Beyrich\r\nhas given the name of Oligocene. None of these occur in the London\r\nBasin, and they occupy in that of Hampshire, as we have seen at p. 244,\r\ntoo insignificant a superficial area to be noticed in a map on this\r\nscale. They fill a larger space in the Paris Basin between the Seine\r\nand the Loire, and constitute also part of the northern limits of the\r\narea of the Netherlands which are shaded in the map.\r\n\r\nIt is in the northern part of the Isle of Wight that we have the\r\nuppermost beds of the true Eocene best exhibited—namely, those which\r\ncorrespond in their fossils with the celebrated gypsum of the Paris\r\nbasin before alluded to, p. 231 (see Table, p. 252). That gypsum has\r\nbeen selected by almost all Continental geologists as affording the\r\nbest line of demarkation between the Middle and Lower Tertiary, or, in\r\nother words, between the Lower Miocene and Eocene formations.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the Table I may observe, that the correlation of the\r\nFrench and English subdivisions here laid down is often a matter of\r\ngreat doubt and difficulty, notwithstanding their geographical\r\nproximity. This arises from various circumstances, partly from the\r\nformer prevalence of marine conditions in one basin simultaneously with\r\nfluviatile or lacustrine in the other, and sometimes from the existence\r\nof land in one area causing a break or absence of all records during a\r\nperiod when deposits may have been in progress in the other basin. As\r\nbearing on this subject, it may be stated that we have unquestionable\r\nevidence of oscillations of level shown by the superposition of salt or\r\nbrackish-water strata to fluviatile beds; and those of deep-sea origin\r\nto strata formed in shallow water. Even if the upward and downward\r\nmovements were uniform in amount and direction, which is very\r\nimprobable, their effect in producing the conversion of sea into land\r\nor land into sea would be different, according to the previous shape\r\nand varying elevation of the land and bottom of the sea. Lastly,\r\ndenudation, marine and subaërial, has frequently caused the absence of\r\ndeposits in one basin of corresponding age to those in the other, and\r\nthis destructive agency has been more than ordinarily effective on\r\naccount of the loose and unconsolidated nature of the sands and clays.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF ENGLISH AND FRENCH EOCENE STRATA.\r\nUPPER EOCENE\r\n\r\nEnglish subdivisions French equivalents A.1.

They consist of marls, clays, and limestones of\r\nfresh-water, brackish, and marine origin. Some of the most abundant\r\nshells, as _Cyrena semistriata_ var., and _Paludina lenta,_ Fig. 163,\r\nare common to this and to the overlying Hempstead series; but the\r\nmajority of the species are distinct. The following are the\r\nsubdivisions described by the late Professor Forbes:\r\n     _a._ Upper marls, distinguished by the abundance of _Melania\r\n     turritissima,_ Forbes (Fig. 165).\r\n     _b._ Lower marls, characterised by _Cerithium mutabile, Cyrena\r\n     pulchra,_ etc., and by the remains of _Trionyx_ (see Fig. 166).\r\n     _c._ Green marls, often abounding in a peculiar species of oyster,\r\n     and accompanied by _ Cerithium, Mytilus, Arca, nucula,_ etc.\r\n     _d._ Bembridge limestones, compact cream-coloured limestones\r\n     alternating with shales and marls, in all of which land-shells are\r\n     common, especially at Sconce, near Yarmouth, as described by Mr.\r\n     F. Edwards. The _Bulimus ellipticus,_ Fig. 167, and _Helix\r\n     occlusa,_ Fig. 168, are among its best known land-shells.\r\n     _Paludina orbicularis,_ Fig. 169, is also of frequent occurrence.\r\n     One of the bands is filled with a little globular _Paludina._\r\n     Among the fresh-water pulmonifera, _ Lymnea longiscata_ (Fig. 171)\r\n     and _Planorbis discus_ (Fig. 170) are the most generally\r\n     distributed: the latter represents or takes the place of the\r\n     _Planorbis euomphalus_ (see Fig. 175) of the more ancient Headon\r\n     series. _Chara tuberculata_ (Fig. 172) is the characteristic\r\n     Bembridge gyrogonite or seed-vessel.\r\n\r\nFig. 165: Melania turritissima, Fig. 166: Fragment of Carapace of\r\nTrionyx, Fig. 167: Bulimus ellipticus, Fig. 168: Helix occlusa, Fig.\r\n169: Paludina orbicularis, Fig. 170: Planorbis discus, Fig. 171: Lymnea\r\nlongiscata, Fig. 172: Chara tuberculata.\r\n\r\nFig. 173: Lower molar tooth.\r\nFrom this formation on the shores of Whitecliff Bay, Dr. Mantell\r\nobtained a fine specimen of a fan palm, _Flabellaria Lamanonis,_\r\nBrong., a plant first obtained from beds of corresponding age in the\r\nsuburbs of Paris. The well-known building-stone of Binstead, near Ryde,\r\na limestone with numerous hollows caused by Cyrenæ which have\r\ndisappeared and left the moulds of their shells, belongs to this\r\nsubdivision of the Bembridge series. In the same Binstead stone Mr.\r\nPratt and the Reverend Darwin Fox first discovered the remains of\r\nmammalia characteristic of the gypseous series of Paris, as _\r\nPalæotherium magnum_ (Fig. 174), _P. medium, P. minus, P. minimum, P.\r\ncurtum, P. crassum_; also _Anoplotherium commune_ (Fig. 173), _A.\r\nsecundarium, Dichobune cervinum,_ and _Chæropotamus Cuvieri._ The\r\nPalæothere above alluded to resembled the living tapir in the form of\r\nthe head, and in having a short proboscis, but its molar teeth were\r\nmore like those of the rhinoceros. _Palæotherium magnum_ was of the\r\nsize of a horse, three or four feet high. The woodcut, Fig. 174, is one\r\nof the restorations which Cuvier attempted of the outline of the living\r\nanimal, derived from the study of the entire skeleton. As the vertical\r\nrange of particular species of quadrupeds, so far as our knowledge\r\nextends, is far more limited than that of the testacea, the occurrence\r\nof so many species at Binstead, agreeing with fossils of the Paris\r\ngypsum, strengthens the evidence derived from shells and plants of the\r\nsynchronism of the two formations.\r\n\r\nFig. 174: Palæotherium magnum.\r\n\r\nOsborne or St. Helen’s Series, A.2.—This group is of fresh and\r\nbrackish-water origin, and very variable in mineral character and\r\nthickness. Near Ryde, it supplies a freestone much used for building,\r\nand called by Professor Forbes the Nettlestone grit. In one part\r\nripple-marked flagstones occur, and rocks with fucoidal markings. The\r\nOsborne beds are distinguished by peculiar species of _Paludina,\r\nMelania,_ and _ Melanopsis,_ as also of _Cypris_ and the seeds of _\r\nChara._\r\n\r\nFig. 175: Planorbis euomphalus, Fig. 176: Helix labyrinthica.\r\n\r\nHeadon Series A.3.—These beds are seen both in Whitecliff Bay, Headon\r\nHill, and Alum Bay, or at the east and west extremities of the Isle of\r\nWight. The upper and lower portions are fresh-water, and the middle of\r\nmixed origin, sometimes brackish and marine. Everywhere _Planorbis\r\neuomphalus,_ Fig. 175, characterises the fresh-water deposits, just as\r\nthe allied form, P. discus, Fig. 170, does the Bembridge limestone. The\r\nbrackish-water beds contain _Potamomya plana, Cerithium mutabile,_ and\r\n_Potamides cinctus_ (Fig. 37), and the marine beds _ Venus_ (or\r\n_Cytherea_) _incrassata,_ a species common to the Limburg beds and Grès\r\nde Fontainebleau, or the Lower Miocene series. The prevalence of\r\nsalt-water remains is most conspicuous in some of the central parts of\r\nthe formation.\r\n\r\nFig. 177: Neritina concava.\r\n\r\nAmong the shells which are widely distributed through the Headon series\r\nare _Neritina concava_ (Fig. 177), _Lymnea caudata_ (Fig. 178), and _\r\nCerithium concavum_ (Fig. 179). _Helix labyrinthica,_ Say (Fig. 176), a\r\nland-shell now inhabiting the United States, was discovered in this\r\nseries by Mr. Searles Wood in Hordwell Cliff. It is also met with in\r\nHeadon Hill, in the same beds. At Sconce, in the Isle of Wight, it\r\noccurs in the Bembridge series, and affords a rare example of an Eocene\r\nfossil of a species still living, though, as usual in such cases,\r\nhaving no local connection with the actual geographical range of the\r\nspecies. The lower and middle portion of the Headon series is also met\r\nwith in Hordwell Cliff (or Hordle, as it is often spelt), near\r\nLymington, Hants. Among the shells which abound in this cliff are\r\n_Paludina lenta_ and various species of _Lymnea, Planorbis, Melania,\r\nCyclas, Unio, Potamomya, Dreissena,_ etc.\r\n\r\nFig. 178: Lymnea caudata, Fig. 179: Cerithium concavum.\r\nAmong the chelonians we find a species of _Emys,_ and no less than six\r\nspecies of _Trionyx_; among the saurians an alligator and a crocodile;\r\namong the ophidians two species of land-snakes (_Paleryx,_ Owen); and\r\namong the fish Sir P. Egerton and Mr. Wood have found the jaws, teeth,\r\nand hard shining scales of the genus _Lepidosteus,_ or bony pike of the\r\nAmerican rivers. This same genus of fresh-water ganoids has also been\r\nmet with in the Hempstead beds in the Isle of Wight. The bones of\r\nseveral birds have been obtained from Hordwell, and the remains of\r\nquadrupeds of the genera _Palæotherium (P. minus), Anoplotherium,\r\nAnthracotherium, Dichodon, Dichobune, Spalacodon,_ and _Hyænodon._ The\r\nlatter offers, I believe, the oldest known example of a true\r\ncarnivorous animal in the series of British fossils, although I attach\r\nvery little theoretical importance to the fact, because herbivorous\r\nspecies are those most easily met with in a fossil state in all save\r\ncavern deposits. In another point of view, however, this fauna deserves\r\nnotice. Its geological position is considerably lower than that of the\r\nBembridge or Montmartre beds, from which it differs almost as much in\r\nspecies as it does from the still more ancient fauna of the Lower\r\nEocene beds to be mentioned in the sequel. It therefore teaches us what\r\na grand succession of distinct assemblages of mammalia flourished on\r\nthe earth during the Eocene period.\r\n\r\nMany of the marine shells of the brackish-water beds of the above\r\nseries, both in the Isle of Wight and Hordwell Cliff, are common to the\r\nunderlying Barton Clay: and, on the other hand, there are some\r\nfresh-water shells, such as _Cyrena obovata,_ which are common to the\r\nBembridge beds, notwithstanding the intervention of the St. Helen’s\r\nseries. The white and green marls of the Headon series, and some of the\r\naccompanying limestones, often resemble the Eocene strata of France in\r\nmineral character and colour in so striking a manner as to suggest the\r\nidea that the sediment was derived from the same region or produced\r\ncontemporaneously under very similar geographical circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt Brockenhurst, near Lyndhurst, in the New Forest, marine strata have\r\nrecently been found containing fifty-nine shells, of which many have\r\nbeen described by Mr. Edwards. These beds rest on the Lower Headon, and\r\nare considered as the equivalent of the middle part of the Headon\r\nseries, many of the shells being common to the brackish-water or Middle\r\nHeadon beds of Colwell and Whitecliff Bays, such as _Cancellaria\r\nmuricata,_ Sowerby, _ Fusus labiatus,_ Sowerby, etc. In these beds at\r\nBrockenhurst, corals, ably described by Dr. Duncan, have recently been\r\nfound in abundance and perfection; see Fig. 180, _Solenastræa\r\ncellulosa._\r\n\r\nFig. 180: Solenastræa cellulosa.\r\n\r\nBaron von Könen[1] has pointed out that no less than forty-six out of\r\nthe fifty-nine Brockenhurst shells, or a proportion of 78 per cent,\r\nagree with species occurring in Dumont’s Lower Tongrian formation in\r\nBelgium. This being the case, we might fairly expect that if we had a\r\nmarine equivalent of the Bembridge series or of the contemporaneous\r\nParis gypsum, we should find it to contain a still greater number of\r\nshells common to the Tongrian beds of Belgium, but the exact\r\ncorrelation of these fresh-water groups of France, Belgium, and Britain\r\nhas not yet been fully made out. It is possible that the Tongrian of\r\nDumont may be newer than the Bembridge series, and therefore referable\r\nto the Lower Miocene. If ever the whole series should be complete, we\r\nmust be prepared to find the marine equivalent of the Bembridge beds,\r\nor the uppermost Eocene, passing by imperceptible shades into the\r\ninferior beds of the overlying Miocene strata.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossils found in the Middle Headon are _Cytherea incrassata_\r\nand _Cerithium plicatum_ (Fig. 160). These shells, especially the\r\nlatter, are very characteristic of the Lower Miocene, and their\r\noccurrence in the Headon series has been cited as an objection to the\r\nline proposed to be drawn between Miocene and Eocene. But if we were to\r\nattach importance to such occasional passages, we should soon find that\r\nno lines of division could be drawn anywhere, for in the present state\r\nof our knowledge of the Tertiary series there will always be species\r\ncommon to beds above and below our boundary-lines.\r\n\r\nFig. 181: Chama squamosa.\r\nBarton Series (_Sands and Clays_), A.4 Table—Both in the Isle of Wight,\r\nand in Hordwell Cliff, Hants, the Headon beds, above-mentioned, rest on\r\nwhite sands usually devoid of fossils, and used in the Isle of Wight\r\nfor making glass. In one of these sands Dr. Wright found _ Chama\r\nsquamosa,_ a Barton Clay shell, in great plenty, and certain\r\nimpressions of marine shells have been found in sands supposed to be of\r\nthe same age in Whitecliff Bay. These sands have been called Upper\r\nBagshot in the maps of our Government Survey, but this identification\r\nof a fossiliferous series in the Isle of Wight with an unfossiliferous\r\nformation in the London Basin can scarcely be depended upon. The Barton\r\nClay, which immediately underlies these sands, is seen vertical in Alum\r\nBay, Isle of Wight, and nearly horizontal in the cliffs of the mainland\r\nnear Lymington. This clay, together with the Bracklesham beds,\r\npresently to be described, has been termed Middle Bagshot by the\r\nSurvey. In Barton Cliff, where it attains a thickness of about 300\r\nfeet, it is rich in marine fossils.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly confounded with the London Clay, an older Eocene\r\ndeposit of very similar mineral character, to be mentioned (p. 263),\r\nwhich contains many shells in common, but not more than one-fourth of\r\nthe whole. In other words, there are known at present 247 species in\r\nthe London Clay and 321 in that of Barton, and only 70 common to the\r\ntwo formations. Fifty-six of these have been found in the intermediate\r\nBracklesham beds, and the reappearance of the other 14 may imply a\r\nreturn of similar conditions, whether of temperature or depth or of a\r\nmuddy argillaceous bottom, common to the two periods of the London and\r\nBarton Clays. According to M. Hebert, the most characteristic Barton\r\nClay fossils correspond to those of the Gres de Beauchamp, or Sables\r\nMoyens, of the Paris Basin, but it also contains many common to the\r\nolder Calcaire Grossier.\r\n\r\nSHELLS OF THE BARTON CLAY.\r\n\r\nCertain foraminifera called Nummulites begin, when we study the\r\nTertiary formations in a descending order, to make their first\r\nappearance in these beds. A small species called _ Nummulites\r\nvariolaria,_ Fig. 190, is found both on the Hampshire coast and in beds\r\nof the same age in Whitecliff Bay, in the Isle of Wight. Several marine\r\nshells, such as _Corbula pisum_ (Fig. 158), are common to the Barton\r\nbeds and the Hempstead or Lower Miocene series, and a still greater\r\nnumber, as before stated, are common to the Headon series.\r\n\r\nFig. 182: Mitra scabra, Fig. 183: Voluta ambigua, Fig. 184: Typhis\r\npungens, Fig. 185: Voluta athleta, Fig. 186: Terebellum fusiforme, Fig.\r\n187: Terebellum sopita, Fig. 188: Cardita sulcata, Fig. 189:\r\nCrassatella sulcata, Fig. 190: Nummulites variolaria.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE EOCENE, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nBracklesham Beds and Bagshot Sands, B.1, Table—Beneath the Barton Clay\r\nwe find in the north of the Isle of Wight, both in Alum and Whitecliff\r\nBays, a great series of various coloured sands and clays for the most\r\npart unfossiliferous, and probably of estuarine origin. As some of\r\nthese beds contain _Cardita planicosta_ (Fig. 191) they have been\r\nidentified with the marine beds much richer in fossils seen in the\r\ncoast section in Bracklesham Bay near Chichester in Sussex, where the\r\nstrata consist chiefly of green clayey sands with some lignite. Among\r\nthe Bracklesham fossils besides the Cardita, the huge _Cerithium\r\ngiganteum_ is seen, so conspicuous in the Calcaire Grossier of Paris,\r\nwhere it is sometimes two feet in length. The _Nummulites lævigata_\r\n(see Fig. 192), so characteristic of the lower beds of the Calcaire\r\nGrossier in France, where it sometimes forms stony layers, as near\r\nCompiègne, is very common in these beds, together with _N. scabra_ and\r\n_N. variolaria._ Out of 193 species of testacea procured from the\r\nBagshot and Bracklesham beds in England, 126 occur in the Calcaire\r\nGrossier in France. It was clearly, therefore, coeval with that part of\r\nthe Parisian series more nearly than with any other.\r\n\r\nFig. 191: Cardita (Venericardia) planicosta, Fig. 192: Nummulites\r\n(Nummularia) lavigata.\r\n\r\nAccording to tables compiled from the best authorities by Mr.\r\nEtheridge, the number of mollusca now known from the Bracklesham beds\r\nin Great Britain is 393, of which no less than 240 are peculiar to this\r\nsubdivision of the British Eocene series, while 70 are common to the\r\nOlder London Clay, and 140 to the Newer Barton Clay. The volutes and\r\ncowries of this formation, as well as the lunulites and corals, favour\r\nthe idea of a warm climate having prevailed, which is borne out by the\r\ndiscovery of a serpent, _Palæophis typhœus_ (see Fig. 193), exceeding,\r\naccording to Professor Owen, twenty feet in length, and allied in its\r\nosteology to the Boa, Python, Coluber, and Hydrus. The compressed form\r\nand diminutive size of certain caudal vertebræ indicate so much analogy\r\nwith Hydrus as to induce Professor Owen to pronounce this extinct\r\nophidian to have been marine.[2] Among the companions of the sea-snake\r\nof Bracklesham was an extinct crocodile (_Gavialis Dixoni,_ Owen), and\r\nnumerous fish, such as now frequent the seas of warm latitudes, as the\r\nOstracion of the family Balistidæ, of which a dorsal spine is figured\r\n(see Fig. 194), and gigantic rays of the genus _ Myliobates_ (see Fig.\r\n195).\r\n\r\nFig. 193: Palæophis typhoeus, Owen; an Eocene sea-serpent, Fig. 194:\r\nDefensive spine of Ostracion.\r\n\r\nFig. 195: Dental plates of Myliobates Edwardsi.\r\nThe teeth of sharks also, of the genera _Carcharodon, Otodus, Lamna,\r\nGaleocerdo,_ and others, are abundant.

(_Lower Bagshot of English Survey_),\r\nB.2, Table—To that great series of sands and clays which intervene\r\nbetween the equivalents of the Bracklesham Beds and the London Clay or\r\nLower Eocene, our Government Survey has given the name of the Lower\r\nBagshot sands, for they are supposed to agree in age with the inferior\r\nunfossiliferous sands of the country round Bagshot in the London Basin.\r\nThis part of the series is finely exposed in the vertical beds of Alum\r\nbay, in the Isle of Wight, and east and west of Bournemouth, on the\r\nsouth coast of Hampshire. In some of the close and white compact clays\r\nof this locality, there are not only dicotyledonous leaves, but\r\nnumerous fronds of ferns allied to Gleichenia which are well preserved\r\nwith their fruit.\r\n\r\nFig. 200: Pleurotoma attenuata, Fig. 201: Voluta Selseïensis, Fig. 202:\r\nTurritella multisulcata, Fig. 203: Lucina serrata, Fig. 204: Conus\r\ndeperditus.\r\n\r\nNone of the beds are of great horizontal extent, and there is much\r\ncross-stratification in the sands, and in some places black\r\ncarbonaceous seams and lignite. In the midst of these leaf-beds in\r\nStudland Bay, Purbeck shells of the genus Unio attest the fresh-water\r\norigin of the white clay.\r\n\r\nNo less than forty species of plants are mentioned by MM. de la Harpe\r\nand Gaudin from this formation in Hampshire, among which the Proteaceæ\r\n(_Dryandra,_ etc.) and the fig tribe are abundant, as well as the\r\ncinnamon and several other laurineæ, with some papilionaceous plants.\r\nOn the whole, they remind the botanist of the types of subtropical\r\nIndia and Australia.[3]\r\n\r\nHeer has mentioned several species which are common to this Alum Bay\r\nflora and that of Monte Bolca, near Verona, so celebrated for its\r\nfossil fish, and where the strata contain nummulites and other Middle\r\nEocene fossils. He has particularly alluded to _Aralia primigenia_ (of\r\nwhich genus a fruit has since been found by Mr. Mitchell at\r\nBournemouth), _Daphnogene Veronensis,_ and _ Ficus granadilla,_ as\r\namong the species common to and characteristic of the Isle of Wight and\r\nItalian Eocene beds; and he observes that in the flora of this period\r\nthese forms of a temperate climate which constitute a marked feature in\r\nthe European Miocene formations, such as the willow, poplar, birch,\r\nalder, elm, hornbeam, oak, fir, and pine, are wanting. The American\r\ntypes are also absent, or much more feebly represented than in the\r\nMiocene period, although fine specimens of the fan-palm (_Sabal_) have\r\nbeen found in these Eocene clays at Studland. The number of exotic\r\nforms which are common to the Eocene and Miocene strata of Europe, like\r\nthose to be alluded to in the sequel which are common to the Eocene and\r\nCretaceous fauna, demonstrate the remoteness of the times in which the\r\ngeographical distribution of living plants originated. A great majority\r\nof the Eocene genera have disappeared from our temperate climates, but\r\nnot the whole of them; and they must all have exerted some influence on\r\nthe assemblages of species which succeeded them. Many of these last\r\noccurring in the Upper Miocene are indeed so closely allied to the\r\nflora now surviving as to make it questionable, even in the opinion of\r\nnaturalists opposed to the doctrine of transmutation, whether they are\r\nnot genealogically related the one to the other.\r\n\r\nLOWER EOCENE FORMATIONS, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nLondon Clay, C.1, Table—This formation underlies the preceding, and\r\nsometimes attains a thickness of 500 feet. It consists of tenacious\r\nbrown and bluish-grey clay, with layers of concretions called septaria,\r\nwhich abound chiefly in the brown clay, and are obtained in sufficient\r\nnumbers from sea-cliffs near Harwich, and from shoals off the coast of\r\nEssex and the Isle of Sheppey, to be used for making Roman cement. The\r\ntotal number of British fossil mollusca known at present (January,\r\n1870) in this formation are 254, of which 166 are peculiar, or not\r\nfound in other Eocene beds in this country. The principal localities of\r\nfossils in the London clay are Highgate Hill, near London, the Island\r\nof Sheppey at the mouth of the Thames, and Bognor on the Sussex coast.\r\nOut of 133 fossil shells, Mr. Prestwich found only 20 to be common to\r\nthe Calcaire Grossier (from which 600 species have been obtained),\r\nwhile 33 are common to the “Lits Coquilliers” (p. 275), in which 200\r\nspecies are known in France.\r\n\r\nIn the Island of Sheppey near the mouth of the Thames, the thickness of\r\nthe London Clay is estimated by Mr. Prestwich to be more than 500 feet,\r\nand it is in the uppermost 50 feet that a great number of fossil fruits\r\nwere obtained, being chiefly found on the beach when the sea has washed\r\naway the clay of the rapidly wasting cliffs.\r\n\r\nFig. 205: Nipadites ellipticus.\r\nMr. Bowerbank, in a valuable publication on these fossil fruits and\r\nseeds, has described no less than thirteen fruits of palms of the\r\nrecent type _Nipa,_ now only found in the Molucca and Philippine\r\nIslands, and in Bengal (see Fig. 205). In the delta of the Ganges, Dr.\r\nHooker observed the large nuts of _Nipa fruticans_ floating in such\r\nnumbers in the various arms of that great river, as to obstruct the\r\npaddle-wheels of steamboats. These plants are allied to the cocoanut\r\ntribe on the one side, and on the other to the _Pandanus,_ or\r\nscrew-pine. There are also met with three species of _Anona,_ or\r\ncustard-apple; and cucurbitaceous fruits (of the gourd and melon\r\nfamily), and fruits of various species of _Acacia._\r\n\r\nBesides fir-cones or fruit of true Coniferæ there are cones of\r\nProteaceæ in abundance, and the celebrated botanist the late Robert\r\nBrown pointed out the affinity of these to the New Holland types\r\n_Petrophila_ and _Isopogon._ Of the first there are about fifty, and of\r\nthe second thirty described species now living in Australia.\r\n\r\nEttingshausen remarked in 1851 that five of the fossil species from\r\nSheppey, named by Bowerbank[4] were specimens of the same fruit (see\r\nFig. 206), in different states of preservation; and Mr. Carruthers,\r\nhaving examined the original specimens now in the British Museum, tells\r\nme that all these cones from Sheppey may be reduced to two species,\r\nwhich have an undoubted affinity to the two existing Australian genera\r\nabove mentioned, although their perfect identity in structure cannot be\r\nmade out.\r\n\r\nFig. 206: Eocene Proteaceous Fruit (Petrophiloides Richardsoni.\r\n\r\nThe contiguity of land may be inferred not only from these vegetable\r\nproductions, but also from the teeth and bones of crocodiles and\r\nturtles, since these creatures, as Dean Conybeare remarked, must have\r\nresorted to some shore to lay their eggs. Of turtles there were\r\nnumerous species referred to extinct genera. These are, for the most\r\npart, not equal in size to the largest living tropical turtles. A\r\nsea-snake, which must have been thirteen feet long, of the genus\r\n_Palæophis_ before mentioned (p. 261) has also been described by\r\nProfessor Owen from Sheppey, of a different species from that of\r\nBracklesham, and called _P. toliapicus._ A true crocodile, also,\r\n_Crocodilus toliapicus,_ and another saurian more nearly allied to the\r\ngavial, accompany the above fossils; also the relics of several birds\r\nand quadrupeds. One of these last belongs to the new genus\r\n_Hyracotherium_ of Owen, of the hog tribe, allied to Chæropotamus,\r\nanother is a _Lophiodon_; a third a pachyderm called _Coryphodon\r\neocænus_ by Owen, larger than any existing tapir. All these animals\r\nseem to have inhabited the banks of the great river which floated down\r\nthe Sheppey fruits. They imply the existence of a mammiferous fauna\r\nantecedent to the period when nummulites flourished in Europe and Asia,\r\nand therefore before the Alps, Pyrenees, and other mountain-chains now\r\nforming the backbones of great continents, were raised from the deep;\r\nnay, even before a part of the constituent rocky masses now entering\r\ninto the central ridges of these chains had been deposited in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe marine shells of the London Clay confirm the inference derivable\r\nfrom the plants and reptiles in favour of a high temperature. Thus many\r\nspecies of _Conus_ and _ Voluta_ occur, a large _Cypræa, C. oviformis,_\r\na very large _Rostellaria_ (Fig. 209), a species of _Cancellaria,_ six\r\nspecies of _Nautilus_ (Fig. 211), besides other Cephalopoda of extinct\r\ngenera, one of the most remarkable of which is the _ Belosepia_ (Fig.\r\n212). Among many characteristic bivalve shells are _Leda amygdaloides_\r\n(Fig. 213) and _Cryptodon angulatum_ (Fig. 214), and among the Radiata\r\na star-fish, _Astropecten_ (Fig. 215.)\r\n\r\nFig. 207: Voluta nodosa, Fig. 208: Phorus extensus, Fig. 209:\r\nRostellaria (Hippocrenes) ampla, Fig. 210: Nautilus centralis, Fig.\r\n211: Aturia ziczac, Fig. 212: Belosepia sepioidea, Fig. 213: Leda\r\namygdaloides, Fig. 214: Cyptodon (Axinus) angulatum, Fig. 215:\r\nAstropecten crispatus.\r\n\r\nThese fossils are accompanied by a sword-fish (_Tetrapterus priscus,_\r\nAgassiz), about eight feet long, and a saw-fish (_Pristis bisulcatus,_\r\nAgassiz), about ten feet in length; genera now foreign to the British\r\nseas. On the whole, about eighty species of fish have been described by\r\nM. Agassiz from these beds of Sheppey, and they indicate, in his\r\nopinion, a warm climate.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the London clay at Kyson, a few miles east of\r\nWoodbridge, the remains of mammalia have been detected. Some of these\r\nhave been referred by Professor Owen to an opossum, and others to the\r\ngenus _Hyracotherium._ The teeth of this last-mentioned pachyderm were\r\nat first, in 1840, supposed to belong to a monkey, an opinion\r\nafterwards abandoned by Owen when more ample materials for comparison\r\nwere obtained.\r\n\r\nWoolwich and Reading Series, C.2, Table—This formation was formerly\r\ncalled the Plastic Clay, as it agrees with a similar clay used in\r\npottery which occupies the same position in the French series, and it\r\nhas been used for the like purposes in England.[5]\r\n\r\nNo formations can be more dissimilar, on the whole, in mineral\r\ncharacter than the Eocene deposits of England and Paris; those of our\r\nown island being almost exclusively of mechanical origin—accumulations\r\nof mud, sand, and pebbles; while in the neighbourhood of Paris we find\r\na great succession of strata composed of limestones, some of them\r\nsiliceous, and of crystalline gypsum and siliceous sandstone, and\r\nsometimes of pure flint used for millstones. Hence it is often\r\nimpossible, as before stated, to institute an exact comparison between\r\nthe various members of the English and French series, and to settle\r\ntheir respective ages. But in regard to the division which we have now\r\nunder consideration, whether we study it in the basins of London,\r\nHampshire, or Paris, we recognise as a general rule the same mineral\r\ncharacter, the beds consisting over a large area of mottled clays and\r\nsand, with lignite, and with some strata of well-rolled flint pebbles,\r\nderived from the chalk, varying in size, but occasionally several\r\ninches in diameter. These strata may be seen in the Isle of Wight in\r\ncontact with the chalk, or in the London basin, at Reading, Blackheath,\r\nand Woolwich. In some of the lowest of them, banks of oysters are\r\nobserved, consisting of _Ostrea bellovacina,_ so common in France in\r\nthe same relative position. In these beds at Bromley, Dr. Buckland\r\nfound a large pebble to which five full-grown oysters were affixed, in\r\nsuch a manner as to show that they had commenced their first growth\r\nupon it, and remained attached to it through life.\r\n\r\nFig. 216: Cyrena cuneiformis, Fig. 217: Melania (Melanatria) inquinata.\r\n\r\nIn several places, as at Woolwich on the Thames, at Newhaven in Sussex,\r\nand elsewhere, a mixture of marine and fresh-water testacea\r\ndistinguishes this member of the series. Among the latter, _ Cyrena\r\ncuneiformis_ (see Fig. 216) and _Melania inquinata_ (see Fig. 217) are\r\nvery common, as in beds of corresponding age in France. They clearly\r\nindicate points where rivers entered the Eocene sea. Usually there is a\r\nmixture of brackish, fresh-water, and marine shells, and sometimes, as\r\nat Woolwich, proofs of the river and the sea having successively\r\nprevailed on the same spot. At New Charlton, in the suburbs of\r\nWoolwich, Mr. de la Condamine discovered in 1849, and pointed out to\r\nme, a layer of sand associated with well-rounded flint pebbles in which\r\nnumerous individuals of the _Cyrena tellinella_ were seen standing\r\nendwise with both their valves united, the siphonal extremity of each\r\nshell being uppermost, as would happen if the mollusks had died in\r\ntheir natural position. I have described[6] a bank of sandy mud, in the\r\ndelta of the Alabama River at Mobile, on the borders of the Gulf of\r\nMexico, where in 1846 I dug out at low tide specimens of living species\r\nof _Cyrena_ and of a _ Gnathodon,_ which were similarly placed with\r\ntheir shells erect, or in a posture which enables the animal to\r\nprotrude its siphon upward, and draw in or reject water at pleasure.\r\nThe water at Mobile is usually fresh, but sometimes brackish. At\r\nWoolwich a body of river-water must have flowed permanently into the\r\nsea where the _Cyrenæ_ lived, and they may have been killed suddenly by\r\nan influx of pure salt-water, which invaded the spot when the river was\r\nlow, or when a subsidence of land took place. Traced in one direction,\r\nor eastward towards Herne Bay, the Woolwich beds assume more and more\r\nof a marine character; while in an opposite, or south-western\r\ndirection, they become, as near Chelsea and other places, more\r\nfresh-water, and contain _Unio, Paludina,_ and layers of lignite, so\r\nthat the land drained by the ancient river seems clearly to have been\r\nto the south-west of the present site of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n_Fluviatile Beds underlying Deep-sea Strata._—Before the minds of\r\ngeologists had become familiar with the theory of the gradual sinking\r\nof land, and its conversion into sea at different periods, and the\r\nconsequent change from shallow to deep water, the fluviatile and\r\nlittoral character of this inferior group appeared strange and\r\nanomalous. After passing through hundreds of feet of London clay,\r\nproved by its fossils to have been deposited in deep salt-water, we\r\narrive at beds of fluviatile origin, and associated with them masses of\r\nshingle, attaining at Blackheath, near London, a thickness of 50 feet.\r\nThese shingle banks are probably of marine origin, but they indicate\r\nthe proximity of land, and the existence of a shore where the flints of\r\nthe chalk were rolled into sand and pebbles, and spread over a wide\r\nspace. We have, therefore, first, as before stated (p. 268), evidence\r\nof oscillations of level during the accumulation of the Woolwich\r\nseries, then of a great submergence, which allowed a marine deposit 500\r\nthick to be laid over the antecedent beds of fresh and brackish water\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThanet Sands, C.3, Table—The Woolwich or plastic clay above described\r\nmay often be seen in the Hampshire basin in actual contact with the\r\nchalk, constituting in such places the lowest member of the British\r\nEocene series. But at other points another formation of marine origin,\r\ncharacterised by a somewhat different assemblage of organic remains,\r\nhas been shown by Mr. Prestwich to intervene between the chalk and the\r\nWoolwich series. For these beds he has proposed the name of “Thanet\r\nSands,” because they are well seen in the Isle of Thanet, in the\r\nnorthern part of Kent, and on the sea-coast between Herne Bay and the\r\nReculvers, where they consist of sands with a few concretionary masses\r\nof sandstone, and contain, among other fossils, _Pholadomya cuneata,\r\nCyprina morrisii, Corbula longirostris, Scalaria Bowerbankii,_ etc. The\r\ngreatest thickness of these beds is 90 feet.\r\n\r\nUPPER EOCENE FORMATIONS OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary formations in the neighbourhood of Paris consist of a\r\nseries of marine and fresh-water strata, alternating with each other,\r\nand filling up a depression in the chalk. The area which they occupy\r\nhas been called the Paris Basin, and is about 180 miles in its greatest\r\nlength from north to south, and about 90 miles in breadth from east to\r\nwest. MM. Cuvier and Brongniart attempted, in 1810, to distinguish five\r\ndifferent groups, comprising three fresh-water and two marine, which\r\nwere supposed to imply that the waters of the ocean, and of rivers and\r\nlakes, had been by turns admitted into and excluded from the same area.\r\nInvestigations since made in the Hampshire and London basins have\r\nrather tended to confirm these views, at least so far as to show that\r\nsince the commencement of the Eocene period there have been great\r\nmovements of the bed of the sea, and of the adjoining lands, and that\r\nthe superposition of deep-sea to shallow-water deposits (the London\r\nClay, for example, to the Woolwich beds) can only be explained by\r\nreferring to such movements. It appears, notwithstanding, from the\r\nresearches of M. Constant Prevost, that some of the minor alternations\r\nand intermixtures of fresh-water and marine deposits, in the Paris\r\nbasin, may be accounted for without such changes of level, by imagining\r\nboth to have been simultaneously in progress, in the same bay of the\r\nsame sea, or a gulf into which many rivers entered.\r\n\r\nGypseous Series of Montmartre, A.1, Table—To enlarge on the numerous\r\nsubdivisions of the Parisian strata would lead me beyond my present\r\nlimits; I shall therefore give some examples only of the most important\r\nformations. Beneath the Grès de Fontainebleau, belonging to the Lower\r\nMiocene period, as before stated, we find, in the neighbourhood of\r\nParis, a series of white and green marls, with subordinate beds of\r\ngypsum. These are most largely developed in the central parts of the\r\nParis basin, and, among other places, in the hill of Montmartre, where\r\nits fossils were first studied by Cuvier.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum quarried there for the manufacture of plaster of Paris\r\noccurs as a granular crystalline rock, and, together with the\r\nassociated marls, contains land and fluviatile shells, together with\r\nthe bones and skeletons of birds and quadrupeds. Several land-plants\r\nare also met with, among which are fine specimens of the fan-palm or\r\npalmetto tribe (_Flabellaria_). The remains also of fresh-water fish,\r\nand of crocodiles and other reptiles, occur in the gypsum. The\r\nskeletons of mammalia are usually isolated, often entire, the most\r\ndelicate extremities being preserved; as if the carcasses, clothed with\r\ntheir flesh and skin, had been floated down soon after death, and while\r\nthey were still swollen by the gases generated by their first\r\ndecomposition. The few accompanying shells are of those light kinds\r\nwhich frequently float on the surface of rivers, together with wood.\r\n\r\nIn this formation the relics of about fifty species of quadrupeds,\r\nincluding the genera _Palæotherium_ (see Fig. 174), _Anoplotherium_\r\n(see Fig. 218), and others, have been found, all extinct, and nearly\r\nfour-fifths of them belonging to the Perissodactyle or odd-toed\r\ndivision of the order _Pachydermata,_ which now contains only four\r\nliving genera, namely, rhinoceros, tapir, horse, and hyrax. With them a\r\nfew carnivorous animals are associated, among which are the _Hyænodon\r\ndasyuroides,_ a species of dog, _Canis Parisiensis,_ and a weasel,\r\n_Cynodon Parisiensis._ Of the _Rodentia_ are found a squirrel; of the\r\n_Cheiroptera,_ a bat; while the _Marsupalia_ (an order now confined to\r\nAmerica, Australia, and some contiguous islands) are represented by an\r\nopossum.\r\n\r\nOf birds, about ten species have been ascertained, the skeletons of\r\nsome of which are entire. None of them are referable to existing\r\nspecies.[7] The same remark, according to MM. Cuvier and Agassiz,\r\napplies both to the reptiles and fish. Among the last are crocodiles\r\nand tortoises of the genera _Emys_ and _ Trionyx._\r\n\r\nFig. 218: Xiphodon gracile, or Anoplotherium gracile.\r\n\r\nThe tribe of land quadrupeds most abundant in this formation is such as\r\nnow inhabits alluvial plains and marshes, and the banks of rivers and\r\nlakes, a class most exposed to suffer by river inundations. Among these\r\nwere several species of _ Palæotherium,_ a genus before alluded to.\r\nThese were associated with the Anoplotherium, a tribe intermediate\r\nbetween pachyderms and ruminants. One of the three divisions of this\r\nfamily was called by Cuvier _Xiphodon._ Their forms were slender and\r\nelegant, and one, named _Xiphodon gracile_ (Fig. 218), was about the\r\nsize of the chamois; and Cuvier inferred from the skeleton that it was\r\nas light, graceful, and agile as the gazelle.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Footprints._—There are three superimposed masses of gypsum in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Paris, separated by intervening deposits of\r\nlaminated marl. In the uppermost of the three, in the valley of\r\nMontmorency, M. Desnoyers discovered in 1859 many footprints of animals\r\noccurring at no less than six different levels.[8] The gypsum to which\r\nthey belong varies from thirty to fifty feet in thickness, and is that\r\nwhich has yielded to the naturalist the largest number of bones and\r\nskeletons of mammalia, birds, and reptiles. I visited the quarries,\r\nsoon after the discovery was made known, with M. Desnoyers, who also\r\nshowed me large slabs in the Museum at Paris, where, on the upper\r\nplanes of stratification, the indented foot-marks were seen, while\r\ncorresponding casts in relief appeared on the lower surfaces of the\r\nstrata of gypsum which were immediately superimposed. A thin film of\r\nmarl, which before it was dried and condensed by pressure must have\r\nrepresented a much thicker layer of soft mud, intervened between the\r\nbeds of solid gypsum. On this mud the animals had trodden, and made\r\nimpressions which had penetrated to the gypseous mass below, then\r\nevidently unconsolidated. Tracks of the _ Anoplotherium_ with its\r\nbisulcate hoof, and the trilobed footprints of _Palæotherium,_ were\r\nseen of different sizes, corresponding to those of several species of\r\nthese genera which Cuvier had reconstructed, while in the same beds\r\nwere foot-marks of carnivorous mammalia. The tracks also of fluviatile,\r\nlacustrine, and terrestrial tortoises (_Emys, Trionyx,_ etc.) were\r\ndiscovered, also those of crocodiles, iguanas, geckos, and great\r\nbatrachians, and the footprints of a huge bird, apparently a wader, of\r\nthe size of the gastornis, to be mentioned in the sequel. There were\r\nlikewise the impressions of the feet of other creatures, some of them\r\nclearly distinguishable from any of the fifty extinct types of mammalia\r\nof which the bones have been found in the Paris gypsum. The whole\r\nassemblage, says Desnoyers, indicate the shores of a lake, or several\r\nsmall lakes communicating with each other, on the borders of which many\r\nspecies of pachyderms wandered, and beasts of prey which occasionally\r\ndevoured them. The tooth-marks of these last had been detected by\r\npalæontologists long before on the bones and skulls of Paleotheres\r\nentombed in the gypsum.\r\n\r\n_Imperfection of the Record._—These foot-marks have revealed to us new\r\nand unexpected proofs that the air-breathing fauna of the Upper Eocene\r\nperiod in Europe far surpassed in the number and variety of its species\r\nthe largest estimate which had previously been formed of it. We may now\r\nfeel sure that the mammalia, reptiles, and birds which have left\r\nportions of their skeletons as memorials of their existence in the\r\nsolid gypsum constituted but a part of the then living creation.\r\nSimilar inferences may be drawn from the study of the whole succession\r\nof geological records. In each district the monuments of periods\r\nembracing thousands, and probably in some instances hundreds of\r\nthousands of years, are totally wanting. Even in the volumes which are\r\nextant the greater number of the pages are missing in any given region,\r\nand where they are found they contain but few and casual entries of the\r\nphysical events or living beings of the times to which they relate. It\r\nmay also be remarked that the subordinate formations met with in two\r\nneighbouring countries, such as France and England (the minor Tertiary\r\ngroups above enumerated), commonly classed as equivalents and referred\r\nto corresponding periods, may nevertheless have been by no means\r\nstrictly coincident in date. Though called contemporaneous, it is\r\nprobable that they were often separated by intervals of many thousands\r\nof years. We may compare them to double stars, which appear single to\r\nthe naked eye because seen from a vast distance in space, and which\r\nreally belong to one and the same stellar system, though occupying\r\nplaces in space extremely remote if estimated by our ordinary standard\r\nof terrestrial measurements.\r\n\r\nCalcaire silicieux, or Travertin inférieur, A.2 and 3, Table—This\r\ncompact siliceous limestone extends over a wide area. It resembles a\r\nprecipitate from the waters of mineral springs, and is often traversed\r\nby small empty sinuous cavities. It is, for the most part, devoid of\r\norganic remains, but in some places contains fresh-water and land\r\nspecies, and never any marine fossils. The calcaire siliceux and the\r\ncalcaire grossier usually occupy distinct parts of the Paris basin, the\r\none attaining its fullest development in those places where the other\r\nis of slight thickness. They are described by some writers as\r\nalternating with each other towards the centre of the basin, as at\r\nSergy and Osny.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum, with its associated marls before described, is in greatest\r\nforce towards the centre of the basin, where the calcaire grossier and\r\ncalcaire silicieux are less fully developed.\r\n\r\nGrès de Beauchamp, or Sables Moyens, A.4, Table—In some parts of the\r\nParis basin, sands and marls, called the Grès de Beauchamp, or Sables\r\nmoyens, divide the gypseous beds from the calcaire grossier proper.\r\nThese sands, in which a small nummulite (N. variolaria) is very\r\nabundant, contain more than 300 species of marine shells, many of them\r\npeculiar, but others common to the next division.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE EOCENE FORMATIONS OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nCalcaire Grossier, upper and middle, B.1, Table—The upper division of\r\nthis group consists in great part of beds of compact, fragile\r\nlimestone, with some intercalated green marls. The shells in some parts\r\nare a mixture of _Cerithium, Cyclostoma,_ and _Corbula_; in others\r\n_Limnea, Cerithium, Paludina,_ etc. In the latter, the bones of\r\nreptiles and mammalia, _Palæotherium_ and _ Lophiodon,_ have been\r\nfound. The middle division, or calcaire grossier proper, consists of a\r\ncoarse limestone, often passing into sand. It contains the greater\r\nnumber of the fossil shells which characterise the Paris basin. No less\r\nthan 400 distinct species have been procured from a single spot near\r\nGrignon, where they are imbedded in a calcareous sand, chiefly formed\r\nof comminuted shells, in which, nevertheless, individuals in a perfect\r\nstate of preservation, both of marine, terrestrial, and fresh-water\r\nspecies, are mingled together. Some of the marine shells may have lived\r\non the spot; but the _Cyclostoma_ and _Limnea,_ being land and\r\nfresh-water shells, must have been brought thither by rivers and\r\ncurrents, and the quantity of triturated shells implies considerable\r\nmovement in the waters.\r\n\r\nNothing is more striking in this assemblage of fossil testacea than the\r\ngreat proportion of species referable to the genus _ Cerithium_ (see p.\r\n245). There occur no less than 137 species of this genus in the Paris\r\nbasin, and almost all of them in the calcaire grossier. Most of the\r\nliving _Cerithia_ inhabit the sea near the mouths of rivers, where the\r\nwaters are brackish; so that their abundance in the marine strata now\r\nunder consideration is in harmony with the hypothesis that the Paris\r\nbasin formed a gulf into which several rivers flowed.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the calcaire grossier round Paris, certain beds occur\r\nof a stone used in building, and called by the French geologists\r\n“Miliolite limestone.” It is almost entirely made up of millions of\r\nmicroscopic shells, of the size of minute grains of sand, which all\r\nbelong to the class Foraminifera. Examples of some of these are given\r\nin Figs. 219 to 221. As this miliolitic stone never occurs in the\r\nFaluns, or Upper Miocene strata of Brittany and Touraine, it often\r\nfurnishes the geologist with a useful criterion for distinguishing the\r\ndetached Eocene and Upper Miocene formations scattered over those and\r\nother adjoining provinces. The discovery of the remains of Palæotherium\r\nand other mammalia in some of the upper beds of the calcaire grossier\r\nshows that these land animals began to exist before the deposition of\r\nthe overlying gypseous series had commenced.\r\n\r\nFig. 219: Calcarina rarispina, Fig. 220: Spirolina stenostoma, Fig.\r\n221: Triloculina inflata.\r\n\r\nLower Calcaire grossier, or Glauconie grossiere, B.1, Table—The lower\r\npart of the calcaire grossier, which often contains much green earth,\r\nis characterised at Auvers, near Pontoise, to the north of Paris, and\r\nstill more in the environs of Compiègne, by the abundance of\r\nnummulites, consisting chiefly of _N. lævigata, N. scabra,_ and _ N.\r\nLamarcki,_ which constitute a large proportion of some of the stony\r\nstrata, though these same foraminifera are wanting in beds of similar\r\nage in the immediate environs of Paris.\r\n\r\nFig. 222: Nerita conoidea.\r\n\r\nSoissonnais sands, or Lits coquilliers, B.2, Table—Below the preceding\r\nformation, shelly sands are seen, of considerable thickness, especially\r\nat Cuisse-Lamotte, near Compiègne, and other localities in the\r\nSoissonnais, about fifty miles N.E. of Paris, from which about 300\r\nspecies of shells have been obtained, many of them common to the\r\ncalcaire grossier and the Bracklesham beds of England, and many\r\npeculiar. The _Nummulites planulata_ is very abundant, and the most\r\ncharacteristic shell is the _Nerita conoidea,_ Lam., a fossil which has\r\na very wide geographical range; for, as M. d’Archiac remarks, it\r\naccompanies the nummulitic formation from Europe to India, having been\r\nfound in Cutch, near the mouths of the Indus, associated with\r\n_Nummulites scabra._ No less than 33 shells of this group are said to\r\nbe identical with shells of the London clay proper, yet, after visiting\r\nCuisse-Lamotte and other localities of the “Sables inférieurs” of\r\nArchiac, I agree with Mr. Prestwich, that the latter are probably newer\r\nthan the London clay, and perhaps older than the Bracklesham beds of\r\nEngland. The London clay seems to be unrepresented in the Paris basin,\r\nunless partially so, by these sands.[9]\r\n\r\nLOWER EOCENE FORMATIONS OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nArgile Plastique, C.2, Table—At the base of the tertiary system in\r\nFrance are extensive deposits of sands, with occasional beds of clay\r\nused for pottery, and called “argile plastique.” Fossil oysters\r\n(_Ostrea bellovacina_) abound in some places, and in others there is a\r\nmixture of fluviatile shells, such as _Cyrena cuneiformis_ (Fig. 216),\r\n_ Melania inquinata_ (Fig. 216), and others, frequently met with in\r\nbeds occupying the same position in the London Basin. Layers of lignite\r\nalso accompany the inferior clays and sands.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the chalk at the bottom of all the tertiary strata in\r\nFrance there generally is a conglomerate or breccia of rolled and\r\nangular chalk-flints, cemented by siliceous sand. These beds appear to\r\nbe of littoral origin, and imply the previous emergence of the chalk,\r\nand its waste by denudation. In the year 1855, the tibia and femur of a\r\nlarge bird equalling at least the ostrich in size were found at Meudon,\r\nnear Paris, at the base of the Plastic clay. This bird, to which the\r\nname of _Gastornis Parisiensis_ has been assigned, appears, from the\r\nMemoirs of MM. Hébert, Lartet, and Owen, to belong to an extinct genus.\r\nProfessor Owen refers it to the class of wading land birds rather than\r\nto an aquatic species.[10]\r\n\r\nThat a formation so much explored for economical purposes as the Argile\r\nplastique around Paris, and the clays and sands of corresponding age\r\nnear London, should never have afforded any vestige of a feathered\r\nbiped previously to the year 1855, shows what diligent search and what\r\nskill in osteological interpretation are required before the existence\r\nof birds of remote ages can be established.\r\n\r\nSables de Bracheux, C.3, Table—The marine sands called the Sables de\r\nBracheux (a place near Beauvais), are considered by M. Hébert to be\r\nolder than the Lignites and Plastic clay, and to coincide in age with\r\nthe Thanet Sands of England. At La Fère, in the Department of Aisne, in\r\na deposit of this age, a fossil skull has been found of a quadruped\r\ncalled by Blainville _Arctocyon primævus,_ and supposed by him to be\r\nrelated both to the bear and to the Kinkajou (_Cercoleptes_). This\r\ncreature appears to be the oldest known tertiary mammifer.\r\n\r\nNummulitic Formations of Europe, Asia, etc.—Of all the rocks of the\r\nEocene period, no formations are of such great geographical importance\r\nas the Upper and Middle Eocene, as above defined, assuming that the\r\nolder tertiary formation, commonly called nummulitic, is correctly\r\nascribed to this group. It appears that of more than fifty species of\r\nthese foraminifera described by D’Archiac, one or two species only are\r\nfound in other tertiary formations whether of older or newer date.\r\n_Nummulites intermedia,_ a Middle Eocene form, ascends into the Lower\r\nMiocene, but it seems doubtful whether any species descends to the\r\nlevel of the London clay, still less to the Argile plastique or\r\nWoolwich beds. Separate groups of strata are often characterised by\r\ndistinct species of nummulite; thus the beds between the lower Miocene\r\nand the lower Eocene may be divided into three sections, distinguished\r\nby three different species of nummulites, _N. variolaria_ in the upper,\r\n_N. lævigata_ in the middle, and _N. planulata_ in the lower beds. The\r\nnummulitic limestone of the Swiss Alps rises to more than 10,000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, and attains here and in other mountain\r\nchains a thickness of several thousand feet. It may be said to play a\r\nfar more conspicuous part than any other tertiary group in the solid\r\nframework of the earth’s crust, whether in Europe, Asia, or Africa. It\r\noccurs in Algeria and Morocco, and has been traced from Egypt, where it\r\nwas largely quarried of old for the building of the Pyramids, into Asia\r\nMinor, and across Persia by Bagdad to the mouths of the Indus. It has\r\nbeen observed not only in Cutch, but in the mountain ranges which\r\nseparate Scinde from Persia, and which form the passes leading to\r\nCaboul; and it has been followed still farther eastward into India, as\r\nfar as eastern Bengal and the frontiers of China.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Thompson found nummulites at an elevation of no less than 16,500\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, in Western Thibet. One of the species,\r\nwhich I myself found very abundant on the flanks of the Pyrenees, in a\r\ncompact crystalline marble (Fig. 223) is called by M. d’Archiac\r\n_Nummulites Puschi._ The same is also very common in rocks of the same\r\nage in the Carpathians. In many distant countries, in Cutch, for\r\nexample, some of the same shells, such as _Nerita conoidea_ (Fig. 222),\r\naccompany the nummulites, as in France. The opinion of many observers,\r\nthat the Nummulitic formation belongs partly to the cretaceous era,\r\nseems chiefly to have arisen from confounding an allied genus,\r\nOrbitoides, with the true Nummulite.\r\n\r\nFig. 223: Nummulites Puschi.\r\n\r\nWhen we have once arrived at the conviction that the nummulitic\r\nformation occupies a middle and upper place in the Eocene series, we\r\nare struck with the comparatively modern date to which some of the\r\ngreatest revolutions in the physical geography of Europe, Asia, and\r\nNorthern Africa must be referred. All the mountain-chains, such as the\r\nAlps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, and Himalayas, into the composition of\r\nwhose central and loftiest parts the nummulitic strata enter bodily,\r\ncould have had no existence till after the Middle Eocene period. During\r\nthat period the sea prevailed where these chains now rise, for\r\nnummulites and their accompanying testacea were unquestionably\r\ninhabitants of salt water. Before these events, comprising the\r\nconversion of a wide area from a sea to a continent, England had been\r\npeopled, as I before pointed out (p. 267), by various quadrupeds, by\r\nherbivorous pachyderms, by insectivorous bats, and by opossums.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the volcanoes which preserve any remains of their original\r\nform, or from the craters of which lava streams can be traced, are more\r\nmodern than the Eocene fauna now under consideration; and besides these\r\nsuperficial monuments of the action of heat, Plutonic influences have\r\nworked vast changes in the texture of rocks within the same period.\r\nSome members of the nummulitic and overlying tertiary strata called\r\n_flysch_ have actually been converted in the central Alps into\r\ncrystalline rocks, and transformed into marble, quartz-rock,\r\nmicha-schist, and gneiss.[11]\r\n\r\nEocene Strata in the United States.—In North America the Eocene\r\nformations occupy a large area bordering the Atlantic, which increases\r\nin breadth and importance as it is traced southward from Delaware and\r\nMaryland to Georgia and Alabama. They also occur in Louisiana and other\r\nStates both east and west of the valley of the Mississippi. At\r\nClaiborne, in Alabama, no less than 400 species of marine shells, with\r\nmany echinoderms and teeth of fish, characterise one member of this\r\nsystem. Among the shells, the _Cardita planicosta,_ before mentioned\r\n(Fig. 191), is in abundance; and this fossil and some others identical\r\nwith European species, or very nearly allied to them, make it highly\r\nprobable that the Claiborne beds agree in age with the central or\r\nBracklesham group of England, and with the calcaire grossiere of\r\nParis.[12]\r\n\r\nHigher in the series is a remarkable calcareous rock, formerly called\r\n“the nummulite limestone,” from the great number of discoid bodies\r\nresembling nummulites which it contains, fossils now referred by A.\r\nd’Orbigny to the genus _Orbitoides,_ which has been demonstrated by Dr.\r\nCarpenter to belong to the foraminifera.[13] That naturalist, moreover,\r\nis of opinion that the Orbitoides alluded to (_O. Mantelli_) is of the\r\nsame species as one found in Cutch, in the Middle Eocene or nummulitic\r\nformation of India.\r\n\r\nAbove the orbitoidal limestone is a white limestone, sometimes soft and\r\nargillaceous, but in parts very compact and calcareous. It contains\r\nseveral peculiar corals, and a large Nautilus allied to _N. ziczac_;\r\nalso in its upper bed a gigantic cetacean, called _Zeuglodon_ by\r\nOwen.[14]\r\n\r\nThe colossal bones of this cetacean are so plentiful in the interior of\r\nClarke County, Alabama, as to be characteristic of the formation. The\r\nvertebral column of one skeleton found by Dr. Buckley at a spot visited\r\nby me, extended to the length of nearly seventy feet, and not far off\r\npart of another backbone nearly fifty feet long was dug up. I obtained\r\nevidence, during a short excursion, of so many localities of this\r\nfossil animal within a distance of ten miles, as to lead me to conclude\r\nthat they must have belonged to at least forty distinct individuals.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen first pointed out that this huge animal was not\r\nreptilian, since each tooth was furnished with double roots (Fig. 224),\r\nimplanted in corresponding double sockets; and his opinion of the\r\ncetacean nature of the fossil was afterwards confirmed by Dr. Wyman and\r\nDr. R. W. Gibbes. That it was an extinct mammal of the whale tribe has\r\nsince been placed beyond all doubt by discovery of the entire skull of\r\nanother fossil species of the same family, having the double occipital\r\ncondyles only met with in mammals, and the convoluted tympanic bones\r\nwhich are characteristic of cetaceans.\r\n\r\nFig. 224: Zeuglodon cetoides, Fig 225: Basilosaurus.\r\n\r\n [1] Quart.

The marked\r\ndiscordance in the fossils of the tertiary, as compared with the\r\ncretaceous formations, has long induced many geologists to suspect that\r\nan indefinite series of ages elapsed between the respective periods of\r\ntheir origin. Measured, indeed, by such a standard, that is to say, by\r\nthe amount of change in the Fauna and Flora of the earth effected in\r\nthe interval, the time between the Cretaceous and Eocene may have been\r\nas great as that between the Eocene and Recent periods, to the history\r\nof which the last seven chapters have been devoted. Several deposits\r\nhave been met with here and there, in the course of the last half\r\ncentury, of an age intermediate between the white chalk and the plastic\r\nclays and sands of the Paris and London districts, monuments which have\r\nthe same kind of interest to a geologist which certain medieval records\r\nexcite when we study the history of nations. For both of them throw\r\nlight on ages of darkness, preceded and followed by others of which the\r\nannals are comparatively well-known to us. But these newly-discovered\r\nrecords do not fill up the wide gap, some of them being closely allied\r\nto the Eocene, and others to the Cretaceous type, while none appear as\r\nyet to possess so distinct and characteristic a fauna as may entitle\r\nthem to hold an independent place in the great chronological series.\r\n\r\nAmong the formations alluded to, the Thanet Sands of Prestwich have\r\nbeen sufficiently described in the last chapter, and classed as Lower\r\nEocene. To the same tertiary series belong the Belgian formations,\r\ncalled by Professor Dumont, Landenian. On the other hand, the\r\nMaestricht and Faxoe limestones are very closely connected with the\r\nchalk, to which also the Pisolitic limestone of France is referable.\r\n\r\nClassification of the Cretaceous Rocks.—The cretaceous group has\r\ngenerally been divided into an Upper and a Lower series, the Upper\r\ncalled familiarly _the chalk,_ and the Lower _the greensand_; the one\r\nderiving its name from the predominance of white earthy limestone and\r\nmarl, of which it consists in a great part of France and England, the\r\nother or lower series from the plentiful mixture of green or chloritic\r\ngrains contained in some of the sands and cherts of which it largely\r\nconsists in the same countries. But these mineral characters often\r\nfail, even when we attempt to follow out the same continuous\r\nsubdivisions throughout a small portion of the north of Europe, and are\r\nworse than valueless when we desire to apply them to more distant\r\nregions. It is only by aid of the organic remains which characterise\r\nthe successive marine subdivisions of the formation that we are able to\r\nrecognise in remote countries, such as the south of Europe or North\r\nAmerica, the formations which were there contemporaneously in progress.\r\nTo the English student of geology it will be sufficient to begin by\r\nenumerating those groups which characterise the series in this country\r\nand others immediately contiguous, alluding but slightly to those of\r\nmore distant regions. In the table (p. 283) it will be seen that I have\r\nused the term Neocomian for that commonly called “Lower Greensand;” as\r\nthis latter term is peculiarly objectionable, since the green grains\r\nare an exception to the rule in many of the members of this group even\r\nin districts where it was first studied and named.\r\n\r\nUPPER CRETACEOUS OR CHALK PERIOD.\r\n\r\nMaestricht Beds and Faxoe Limestone.\r\n\r\nUpper White Chalk, with flints.\r\n\r\nLower White Chalk, without flints.\r\n\r\nChalk Marl.\r\n\r\nChloritic series (or Upper Greensand).\r\n\r\nGault.\r\n\r\nLOWER CRETACEOUS OR NEOCOMIAN.

Some few are of\r\nspecies common to the inferior white chalk, among which may be\r\nmentioned _Belemnitella mucronata_ (Fig. 226) and _Pecten\r\nquadricostatus,_ a shell regarded by many as a mere variety of _P.\r\nquinquecostatus_ (see Fig. 270). Besides the Belemnite there are other\r\n_genera,_ such as _Baculites_ and _Hamites,_ never found in strata\r\nnewer than the cretaceous, but frequently met with in these Maestricht\r\nbeds. On the other hand, _Voluta, Fasciolaria,_ and other genera of\r\nunivalve shells, usually met with only in tertiary strata, occur.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the rock, about 20 feet thick, as seen in St. Peter’s\r\nMount, in the suburbs of Maestricht, abounds in corals and Bryozoa,\r\noften detachable from the matrix; and these beds are succeeded by a\r\nsoft yellowish limestone 50 feet thick, extensively quarried from time\r\nimmemorial for building. The stone below is whiter, and contains\r\noccasional nodules of grey chert or chalcedony.\r\n\r\nM. Bosquet, with whom I examined this formation (August, 1850), pointed\r\nout to me a layer of chalk from two to four inches thick, containing\r\ngreen earth and numerous encrinital stems, which forms the line of\r\ndemarkation between the strata containing the fossils peculiar to\r\nMaestricht and the white chalk below. The latter is distinguished by\r\nregular layers of black flint in nodules, and by several shells, such\r\nas _Terebratula carnea_ (see Fig. 246), wholly wanting in beds higher\r\nthan the green band. Some of the organic remains, however, for which\r\nSt. Peter’s Mount is celebrated, occur both above and below that\r\nparting layer, and, among others, the great marine reptile called\r\n_Mosasaurus_ (see Fig. 227), a saurian supposed to have been 24 feet in\r\nlength, of which the entire skull and a great part of the skeleton have\r\nbeen found. Such remains are chiefly met with in the soft freestone,\r\nthe principal member of the Maestricht beds. Among the fossils common\r\nto the Maestricht and white chalk may be instanced the echinoderm, Fig.\r\n228.\r\n\r\nMosasaurus Camperi.\r\n\r\nHemipneustes radiatus.\r\nI saw proofs of the previous denudation of the white chalk exhibited in\r\nthe lower bed of the Maestricht formation in Belgium, about 30 miles\r\nS.W. of Maestricht, at the village of Jendrain, where the base of the\r\nnewer deposit consisted chiefly of a layer of well-rolled, black\r\nchalk-flint pebbles, in the midst of which perfect specimens of\r\n_Thecidea papillata_ and _Belemnitella mucronata_ are imbedded. To a\r\ngeologist accustomed in England to regard rolled pebbles of chalk-flint\r\nas a common and distinctive feature of tertiary beds of different ages,\r\nit is a new and surprising phenomenon to behold strata made up of such\r\nmaterials, and yet to feel no doubt that they were accumulated in a sea\r\nin which the belemnite and other cretaceous mollusca flourished.\r\n\r\nPisolitic Limestone of France.—Geologists were for many years at\r\nvariance respecting the chronological relations of this rock, which is\r\nmet with in the neighbourhood of Paris, and at places north, south,\r\neast, and west of that metropolis, as between Vertus and Laversines,\r\nMeudon and Montereau. By many able palæontologists the species of\r\nfossils, more than fifty in number, were declared to be more Eocene in\r\ntheir appearance than Cretaceous. But M. Hébert found in this formation\r\nat Montereau, near Paris, the _Pecten quadricostatus,_ a well-known\r\nCretaceous species, together with some other fossils common to the\r\nMaestricht chalk and to the Baculite limestone of the Cotentin, in\r\nNormandy. He therefore, as well as M. Alcide d’Orbigny, who had\r\ncarefully studied the fossils, came to the opinion that it was an upper\r\nmember of the Cretaceous group. It is usually in the form of a coarse\r\nyellowish or whitish limestone, and the total thickness of the series\r\nof beds already known is about 100 feet. Its geographical range,\r\naccording to M. Hébert, is not less than 45 leagues from east to west,\r\nand 35 from north to south. Within these limits it occurs in small\r\npatches only, resting unconformably on the white chalk.\r\n\r\nThe _Nautilus Danicus,_ Fig. 230, and two or three other species found\r\nin this rock, are frequent in that of Faxoe, in Denmark, but as yet no\r\nAmmonites, Hamites, Scaphites, Turrilites, Baculites, or Hippurites\r\nhave been met with. The proportion of peculiar species, many of them of\r\ntertiary aspect, is confessedly large; and great aqueous erosion\r\nsuffered by the white chalk, before the pisolitic limestone was formed,\r\naffords an additional indication of the two deposits being widely\r\nseparated in time. The pisolitic formation, therefore, may eventually\r\nprove to be somewhat more intermediate in date between the secondary\r\nand tertiary epochs than the Maestricht rock.\r\n\r\nChalk of Faxoe.— In the island of Seeland, in Denmark, the newest\r\nmember of the chalk series, seen in the sea-cliffs at Stevensklint\r\nresting on white chalk with flints, is a yellow limestone, a portion of\r\nwhich, at Faxoe, where it is used as a building stone, is composed of\r\ncorals, even more conspicuously than is usually observed in recent\r\ncoral reefs. It has been quarried to the depth of more than 40 feet,\r\nbut its thickness is unknown. The imbedded shells are chiefly casts,\r\nmany of them of univalve mollusca, which are usually very rare in the\r\nwhite chalk of Europe. Thus, there are two species of _Cypræa,_ one of\r\n_Oliva,_ two of _Mitra,_ four of the genus _Cerithium,_ six of _Fusus,_\r\ntwo of _Trochus,_ one of _Patella,_ one of _Emarginula,_ etc.; on the\r\nwhole, more than thirty univalves, spiral or patelliform. At the same\r\ntime, some of the accompanying bivalve shells, echinoderms, and\r\nzoophytes, are specifically identical with fossils of the true\r\nCretaceous series. Among the cephalopoda of Faxoe may be mentioned\r\n_Baculites Faujasii_ (Fig. 229), and _Belemnitella mucronata_ (Fig.\r\n226), shells of the white chalk. The _Nautilus Danicus_ (see Fig. 230)\r\nis characteristic of this formation; and it also occurs in France in\r\nthe calcaire pisolitique of Laversin (Department of Oise). The claws\r\nand entire skull of a small crab, _Brachyurus rugosus_ (Schlott.), are\r\nscattered through the Faxoe stone, reminding us of similar crustaceans\r\ninclosed in the rocks of modern coral reefs. Some small portions of\r\nthis coralline formation consist of white earthy chalk.\r\n\r\nFig. 229: Portion of Baculites Faujasii, Fig. 230: Nautilus Danicus.\r\n\r\nComposition, Extent and Origin of the White Chalk.—The highest beds of\r\nchalk in England and France consist of a pure, white, calcareous mass,\r\nusually too soft for a building-stone, but sometimes passing into a\r\nmore solid state. It consists, almost purely, of carbonate of lime; the\r\nstratification is often obscure, except where rendered distinct by\r\ninterstratified layers of flint, a few inches thick, occasionally in\r\ncontinuous beds, but oftener in nodules, and recurring at intervals\r\ngenerally from two to four feet distant from each other. This upper\r\nchalk is usually succeeded, in the descending order, by a great mass of\r\nwhite chalk without flints, below which comes the chalk marl, in which\r\nthere is a slight admixture of argillaceous matter. The united\r\nthickness of the three divisions in the south of England equals, in\r\nsome places, 1000 feet. The section in Fig. 231 will show the manner in\r\nwhich the white chalk extends from England into France, covered by the\r\ntertiary strata described in former chapters, and reposing on lower\r\ncretaceous beds.\r\n\r\nThe area over which the white chalk preserves a nearly homogeneous\r\naspect is so vast, that the earlier geologists despaired of discovering\r\nany analogous deposits of recent date. Pure chalk, of nearly uniform\r\naspect and composition, is met with in a north-west and south-east\r\ndirection, from the north of Ireland to the Crimea, a distance of about\r\n1140 geographical miles, and in an opposite direction it extends from\r\nthe south of Sweden to the south of Bordeaux, a distance of about 840\r\ngeographical miles. In Southern Russia, according to Sir R. Murchison,\r\nit is sometimes 600 feet thick, and retains the same mineral character\r\nas in France and England, with the same fossils, including _Inoceramus\r\nCuvieri, Belemnitella mucronata,_ and _Ostrea vesicularis_ (Fig. 251).\r\n\r\nDiagrammatic section from Hertfordshire, in England, to Sens, in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nGreat light has recently been thrown upon the origin of the\r\nunconsolidated white chalk by the deep soundings made in the North\r\nAtlantic, previous to laying down, in 1858, the electric telegraph\r\nbetween Ireland and Newfoundland. At depths sometimes exceeding two\r\nmiles, the mud forming the floor of the ocean was found, by Professor\r\nHuxley, to be almost entirely composed (more than nineteen-twentieths\r\nof the whole) of minute Rhizopods, or foraminiferous shells of the\r\ngenus Globigerina, especially the species _Globigerina bulloides_ (see\r\nFig. 232.) the organic bodies next in quantity were the siliceous\r\nshells called _ Polycystineæ,_ and next to them the siliceous skeletons\r\nof plants called _Diatomaceæ_ (Figs. 233, 234, 235), and occasionally\r\nsome siliceous spiculæ of sponges (Fig. 236) were intermixed. These\r\nwere connected by a mass of living gelatinous matter to which he has\r\ngiven the name of _Bathybius,_ and which contains abundance of very\r\nminute bodies termed Coccoliths and Coccospheres, which have also been\r\ndetected fossil in chalk.\r\n\r\nSir Leopold MacClintock and Dr. Wallich have ascertained that 95 per\r\ncent of the mud of a large part of the North Atlantic consists of\r\nGlobigerina shells. But Captain Bullock, R.N., lately brought up from\r\nthe enormous depth of 16,860 feet a white, viscid, chalky mud, wholly\r\ndevoid of Globigerinæ. This mud was perfectly homogeneous in\r\ncomposition, and contained no organic remains visible to the naked eye.\r\nMr. Etheridge, however, has ascertained by microscopical examination\r\nthat it is made up of _ Coccoliths, Discoliths,_ and other minute\r\nfossils like those of the Chalk classed by Huxley as _Bathybius,_ when\r\nthis term is used in its widest sense. This mud, more than three miles\r\ndeep, was dredged up in latitude 20° 19′ N., longitude 4° 36′ E., or\r\nabout midway between Madeira and the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nFig. 232: Globigerina bulloides, Calcareous Rhizopod. Fig. 233:\r\nActinocyclus, Fig. 234: Pinnularia, Fig. 235: Eunotia bidens, Siliceous\r\nDiatomaceæ. Fig. 236: Spicula of sponge, Siliceous sponge.\r\n\r\nThe recent deep-sea dredgings in the Atlantic conducted by Dr. Wyville\r\nThomson, Dr. Carpenter, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, and others, have shown that\r\non the same white mud there sometimes flourish Mollusca, Crustacea, and\r\nEchinoderms, besides abundance of siliceous sponges, forming, on the\r\nwhole, a marine fauna bearing a striking resemblance in its general\r\ncharacter to that of the ancient chalk.\r\n\r\nPopular Error as to the Geological Continuity of the Cretaceous\r\nPeriod.—We must be careful, however, not to overrate the points of\r\nresemblance which the deep-sea investigations have placed in a strong\r\nlight. They have been supposed by some naturalists to warrant a\r\nconclusion expressed in these words: “We are still living in the\r\nCretaceous epoch;” a doctrine which has led to much popular delusion as\r\nto the bearing of the new facts on geological reasoning and\r\nclassification. The reader should be reminded that in geology we have\r\nbeen in the habit of founding our great chronological divisions, not on\r\nforaminifera and sponges, nor even on echinoderms and corals, but on\r\nthe remains of the most highly organised beings available to us, such\r\nas the mollusca; these being met with, as explained (p. 142), in\r\nstratified rocks of almost every age. In dealing with the mollusca, it\r\nis those of the highest or most specialised organisation, which afford\r\nus the best characters in proportion as their vertical range is the\r\nmost limited. Thus the Cephalopoda are the most valuable, as having a\r\nmore restricted range in time than the Gasteropoda; and these, again,\r\nare more characteristic of the particular stratigraphical subdivisions\r\nthan are the Lamellibranchiate Bivalves, while these last, again, are\r\nmore serviceable in classification than the Brachiopoda, a still lower\r\nclass of shell-fish, which are the most enduring of all.\r\n\r\nWhen told that the new dredgings prove that “we are still living in the\r\nChalk Period,” we naturally ask whether some cuttle-fish has been found\r\nwith a Belemnite forming part of its internal framework; or have\r\nAmmonites, Baculites, Hamites, Turrilites, with four or five other\r\nCephalopodous genera characteristic of the chalk and unknown as\r\ntertiary, been met with in the abysses of the ocean? Or, in the absence\r\nof these long-extinct forms, has a single spiral univalve, or species\r\nof Cretaceous Gasteropod, been found living? Or, to descend still lower\r\nin the scale, has some characteristic Cretaceous genus of\r\nLamellibranchiate Bivalve, such as the Inoceramus, or Hippurite,\r\nforeign to the Tertiary seas, been proved to have survived down to our\r\ntime? Or, of the numerous genera of lamellibranchiates common to the\r\nCretaceous and Recent seas, has one species been found living? The\r\nanswer to all these questions is—not one has been found. Even of the\r\nhumblest shell-fish, the Brachiopods, no new species common to the\r\nCretaceous and recent seas has yet been met with. It has been very\r\ngenerally admitted by conchologists that out of a hundred species of\r\nthis tribe occurring fossil in the Upper Chalk—one, and one only,\r\n_Terebratulina striata,_ is still living, being thought to be identical\r\nwith _Terebratula caput-serpentis._ Although this identity is still\r\nquestioned by some naturalists of authority, it would certainly not\r\nsurprise us if another lamp-shell of equal antiquity should be met with\r\nin the deep sea.\r\n\r\nHad it been declared that we are living in the Eocene epoch, the idea\r\nwould not be so extravagant, for the great reptiles of the Upper Chalk,\r\nthe Mosasaurus, Pliosaurus, and Pterodactyle, and many others, as well\r\nas so many genera of chambered univalves, had already disappeared from\r\nthe earth, and the marine fauna had made a greater approach to our own\r\nby nearly the entire difference which separates it from the fauna of\r\nthe Cretaceous seas. The Eocene nummulitic limestone of Egypt is a rock\r\nmainly composed, like the more ancient white chalk, of globigerine mud;\r\nand if the reader will refer to what we have said of the extent to\r\nwhich the nummulitic marine strata, formed originally at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, now enter into the frame-work of mountain chains of the\r\nprincipal continents, he will at once perceive that the present\r\nAtlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans are geographical terms, which must\r\nbe wholly without meaning when applied to the Eocene, and still more to\r\nthe Cretaceous Period; so that to talk of the chalk having been\r\nuninterruptedly forming in the Atlantic from the Cretaceous Period to\r\nour own, is as inadmissible in a geographical as in a geological sense.\r\n\r\nChalk-flints.—The origin of the layers of flint, whether in the form of\r\nnodules, or continuous sheets, or in veins or cracks not parallel to\r\nthe stratification, has always been more difficult to explain than that\r\nof the white chalk. But here, again, the late deep-sea soundings have\r\nsuggested a possible source of such mineral matter. During the cruise\r\nof the “Bulldog,” already alluded to, it was ascertained that while the\r\ncalcareous _Globigerinæ_ had almost exclusive possession of certain\r\ntracts of the sea-bottom, they were wholly wanting in others, as\r\nbetween Greenland and Labrador. According to Dr. Wallich, they may\r\nflourish in those spaces where they derive nutriment from organic and\r\nother matter, brought from the south by the warm waters of the Gulf\r\nStream, and they may be absent where the effects of that great current\r\nare not felt. Now, in several of the spaces where the calcareous\r\nRhizopods are wanting, certain microscopic plants, called _Diatomaceæ,_\r\nabove mentioned (Figs. 233-235), the solid parts of which are\r\nsiliceous, monopolise the ground at a depth of nearly 400 fathoms, or\r\n2400 feet.\r\n\r\nThe large quantities of silex in solution required for the formation of\r\nthese plants may probably arise from the disintegration of feldspathic\r\nrocks, which are universally distributed. As more than half of their\r\nbulk is formed of siliceous earth, they may afford an endless supply of\r\nsilica to all the great rivers which flow into the ocean. We may\r\nimagine that, after a lapse of many years or centuries, changes took\r\nplace in the direction of the marine currents, favouring at one time a\r\nsupply in the same area of siliceous, and at another of calcareous\r\nmatter in excess, giving rise in the one case to a preponderance of\r\nGlobigerinæ, and in the other of Diatomaceæ. These last, and certain\r\nsponges, may by their decomposition have furnished the silex, which,\r\nseparating from the chalky mud, collected round organic bodies, or\r\nformed nodules, or filled shrinkage cracks.\r\n\r\nPot-stones.—A more difficult enigma is presented by the occurrence of\r\ncertain huge flints, or pot-stones, as they are called in Norfolk,\r\noccurring singly, or arranged in nearly continuous columns at right\r\nangles to the ordinary and horizontal layers of small flints. I visited\r\nin the year 1825 an extensive range of quarries then open on the river\r\nBure, near Horstead, about six miles from Norwich, which afforded a\r\ncontinuous section, a quarter of a mile in length, of white chalk,\r\nexposed to the depth of about twenty-six feet, and covered by a bed of\r\ngravel. The pot-stones, many of them pear-shaped, were usually about\r\nthree feet in height and one foot in their transverse diameter, placed\r\nin vertical rows, like pillars, at irregular distances from each other,\r\nbut usually from twenty to thirty feet apart, though sometimes nearer\r\ntogether, as in Figure 237. These rows did not terminate downward in\r\nany instance which I could examine, nor upward, except at the point\r\nwhere they were cut off abruptly by the bed of gravel. On breaking open\r\nthe pot-stones, I found an internal cylindrical nucleus of pure chalk,\r\nmuch harder than the ordinary surrounding chalk, and not crumbling to\r\npieces like it, when exposed to the winter’s frost. At the distance of\r\nhalf a mile, the vertical piles of pot-stones were much farther apart\r\nfrom each other. Dr. Buckland has described very similar phenomena as\r\ncharacterising the white chalk on the north coast of Antrim, in\r\nIreland.[2]\r\n\r\nView of a chalk-pit at Horstead, near Norwich, showing the position of\r\nthe pot-stones.\r\n\r\nVitreous Sponges of the Chalk.—These pear-shaped masses of flint often\r\nresemble in shape and size the large sponges called Neptune’s Cups\r\n(_Spongia patera,_ Hardw.), which grow in the seas of Sumatra; and if\r\nwe could suppose a series of such gigantic sponges to be separated from\r\neach other, like trees in a forest, and the individuals of each\r\nsuccessive generation to grow on the exact spot where the parent sponge\r\ndied and was enveloped in calcareous mud, so that they should become\r\npiled one above the other in a vertical column, their growth keeping\r\npace with the accumulation of the enveloping calcareous mud, a\r\ncounterpart of the phenomena of the Horstead pot-stones might be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nFig. 238: Ventriculites radiatus. White chalk.\r\nProfessor Wyville Thomson, describing the modern soundings in 1869 off\r\nthe north coast of Scotland, speaks of the ooze or chalk mud brought\r\nfrom a depth of about 3000 feet, and states that at one haul they\r\nobtained forty specimens of vitreous sponges buried in the mud. He\r\nsuggests that the Ventriculites of the chalk were nearly allied to\r\nthese sponges, and that when the silica of their spicules was removed,\r\nand was dissolved out of the calcareous matrix, it set into flint.\r\n\r\nBoulders and Groups of Pebbles in Chalk.—The occurrence here and there,\r\nin the white chalk of the south of England, of isolated pebbles of\r\nquartz and green schist has justly excited much wonder. It was at first\r\nsupposed that they had been dropped from the roots of some floating\r\ntree, by which means stones are carried to some of the small coral\r\nislands of the Pacific. But the discovery in 1857 of a group of stones\r\nin the white chalk near Croydon, the largest of which was syenite and\r\nweighed about forty pounds, accompanied by pebbles and fine sand like\r\nthat of a beach, has been shown by Mr. Godwin Austen to be inexplicable\r\nexcept by the agency of floating ice. If we consider that icebergs now\r\nreach 40 degrees north latitude in the Atlantic, and several degrees\r\nnearer the equator in the southern hemisphere, we can the more easily\r\nbelieve that even during the Cretaceous epoch, assuming that the\r\nclimate was milder, fragments of coast ice may have floated\r\noccasionally as far as the south of England.\r\n\r\nDistinctness of Mineral Character in Contemporaneous Rocks of the\r\nCretaceous Period.—But we must not imagine that because pebbles are so\r\nrare in the white chalk of England and France there are no proofs of\r\nsand, shingle, and clay having been accumulated contemporaneously even\r\nin European seas. The siliceous sandstone called “upper quader” by the\r\nGermans overlies white argillaceous chalk or “pläner-kalk,” a deposit\r\nresembling in composition and organic remains the chalk marl of the\r\nEnglish series. This sandstone contains as many fossil shells common to\r\nour white chalk as could be expected in a sea-bottom formed of such\r\ndifferent materials. It sometimes attains a thickness of 600 feet, and,\r\nby its jointed structure and vertical precipices, plays a conspicuous\r\npart in the picturesque scenery of Saxon Switzerland, near Dresden. It\r\ndemonstrates that in the Cretaceous sea, as in our own, distinct\r\nmineral deposits were simultaneously in progress. The quartzose\r\nsandstone alluded to, derived from the detritus of the neighbouring\r\ngranite, is absolutely devoid of carbonate of lime, yet it was formed\r\nat the distance only of four hundred miles from a sea-bottom now\r\nconstituting part of France, where the purely calcareous white chalk\r\nwas forming. In the North American continent, on the other hand, where\r\nthe Upper Cretaceous formations are so widely developed, true white\r\nchalk, in the ordinary sense of that term, does not exist.\r\n\r\nFig. 239: Ananchytes ovatus. White chalk, upper and lower.\r\n\r\nFossils of the White Chalk.—Among the fossils of the white chalk,\r\nechinoderms are very numerous; and some of the genera, like\r\n_Ananchytes_ (see Fig. 239), are exclusively cretaceous. Among the\r\nCrinoidea, the _Marsupites_ (Fig. 242) is a characteristic genus. Among\r\nthe mollusca, the cephalopoda are represented by Ammonites, Baculites\r\n(Fig. 229), and Belemnites (Fig. 226). Although there are eight or more\r\nspecies of Ammonites and six of them peculiar to it, this genus is much\r\nless fully represented than in each of the other subdivisions of the\r\nUpper Cretaceous group.\r\n\r\nAmong the brachiopoda in the white chalk, the _ Terebratulæ_ are very\r\nabundant (see Figs. 243-247). With these are associated some forms of\r\noyster (see Fig. 251), and other bivalves (Figs. 249, 250).\r\n\r\nFig. 240: Micraster cor-angumum. White chalk. Fig. 241: Galerites\r\nalbogalerus.

The upper or\r\nopercular valve is wanting.\r\n\r\nThe general absence of univalve mollusca in the white chalk is very\r\nmarked. Of bryozoa there is an abundance, such as _Eschara_ and\r\n_Escharina_ (Figs. 257, 258). These and other organic bodies,\r\nespecially sponges, such as _Ventriculites_ (Fig. 238), are dispersed\r\nindifferently through the soft chalk and hard flint, and some of the\r\nflinty nodules owe their irregular forms to inclosed sponges, such as\r\nFig. 259, _a,_ where the hollows in the exterior are caused by the\r\nbranches of a sponge (Fig. 259, _b_), seen on breaking open the flint.\r\n\r\nFig. 257: Eschara disticha. White chalk. Fig. 258: Escharina oceani.\r\nWhite chalk. Fig. 259: A branching sponge in a flint, from the white\r\nchalk.\r\n\r\nThe remains of fishes of the Upper Cretaceous formations consist\r\nchiefly of teeth belonging to the shark family. Some of the genera are\r\ncommon to the Tertiary formations, and some are distinct. To the latter\r\nbelongs the genus _Ptychodus_ (Fig. 260), which is allied to the living\r\nPort Jackson shark, _Cestracion Phillippi,_ the anterior teeth of which\r\n(see Fig. 261, _a_) are sharp and cutting, while the posterior or\r\npalatal teeth (_b_) are flat (Fig. 260). But we meet with no bones of\r\nland-animals, nor any terrestrial or fluviatile shells, nor any plants,\r\nexcept sea-weeds, and here and there a piece of drift-wood. All the\r\nappearances concur in leading us to conclude that the white chalk was\r\nthe product of an open sea of considerable depth.\r\n\r\nFig. 260: Palatal tooth of Ptychodus decurrens. Lower white chalk.\r\n\r\nThe existence of turtles and oviparous saurians, and of a Pterodactyl\r\nor winged lizard, found in the white chalk of Maidstone, implies, no\r\ndoubt, some neighbouring land; but a few small islets in mid-ocean,\r\nlike Ascension, formerly so much frequented by migratory droves of\r\nturtle, might perhaps have afforded the required retreat where these\r\ncreatures laid their eggs in the sand, or from which the flying species\r\nmay have been blown out to sea. Of the vegetation of such islands we\r\nhave scarcely any indication, but it consisted partly of cycadaceous\r\nplants; for a fragment of one of these was found by Captain Ibbetson in\r\nthe Chalk Marl of the Isle of Wight, and is referred by A. Brongniart\r\nto _ Clathraria Lyellii,_ Mantell, a species common to the antecedent\r\nWealden period. The fossil plants, however, of beds corresponding in\r\nage to the white chalk at Aix-la-Chapelle, presently to be described,\r\nlike the sandy beds of Saxony, before alluded to (p. 293), afford such\r\nevidence of land as to prove how vague must be any efforts of ours to\r\nrestore the geography of that period.\r\n\r\nFig. 261: Cestracion Phillipi; recent.\r\nThe Pterodactyl of the Kentish chalk, above alluded to, was of gigantic\r\ndimensions, measuring 16 feet 6 inches from tip to tip of its\r\noutstretched wings. Some of its elongated bones were at first mistaken\r\nby able anatomists for those of birds; of which class no osseous\r\nremains have as yet been derived from the white chalk, although they\r\nhave been found (as will be seen on page 299) in the Chloritic sand.\r\n\r\nThe collector of fossils from the white chalk was formerly puzzled by\r\nmeeting with certain bodies which they call larch-cones, which were\r\nafterwards recognised by Dr. Buckland to be the excrement of fish (see\r\nFig. 262). They are composed in great part of phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\nFig. 262: Coprolites of fish, from the chalk. Fig. 263: Baculites\r\nanceps. Lower chalk. Fig. 264: Ammonites Rhotomagensis. Chalk marl.\r\n\r\nLower White Chalk.—The Lower White Chalk, which is several hundred feet\r\nthick, without flints, has yielded 25 species of Ammonites, of which\r\nhalf are peculiar to it. The genera Baculite, Hamite, Scaphite,\r\nTurrilite, Nautilus, Belemnite, and Belemnitella, are also represented.\r\n\r\nChalk Marl.—The lower chalk without flints passes gradually downward,\r\nin the south of England, into an argillaceous limestone, “the chalk\r\nmarl,” already alluded to. It contains 32 species of Ammonites, seven\r\nof which are peculiar to it, while eleven pass up into the overlying\r\nlower white chalk. _ A. Rhotomagensis_ is characteristic of this\r\nformation. Among the British cephalopods of other genera may be\r\nmentioned _Scaphites æqualis_ (Fig. 266) and _Turrilites costatus_\r\n(Fig. 265).\r\n\r\nChloritic Series (or Upper Greensand).—According to the old\r\nnomenclature, this subdivision of the chalk was called Upper Greensand,\r\nin order to distinguish it from those members of the Neocomian or Lower\r\nCretaceous series below the Gault to which the name of Greensand had\r\nbeen applied. Besides the reasons before given (p. 282) for abandoning\r\nthis nomenclature, it is objectionable in this instance as leading the\r\nuninitiated to suppose that the divisions thus named Upper and Lower\r\nGreensand are of co-ordinate value, instead of which the chloritic sand\r\nis quite a subordinate member of the Upper Cretaceous group, and the\r\nterm Greensand has very commonly been used for the whole of the Lower\r\nCretaceous rocks, which are almost comparable in importance to the\r\nentire Upper Cretaceous series. The higher portion of the Chloritic\r\nseries in some districts has been called chloritic marl, from its\r\nconsisting of a chalky marl with chloritic grains. In parts of Surrey,\r\nwhere calcareous matter is largely intermixed with sand, it forms a\r\nstone called malm-rock or firestone. In the cliffs of the southern\r\ncoast of the Isle of Wight it contains bands of calcareous limestone\r\nwith nodules of chert.\r\n\r\nFig. 265: Turrilites costatus. Lower chalk and chalk marl. Fig. 266:\r\nScaphites æqualis. Chloritic marl and sand, Dorsetshire.\r\n_Coprolite Bed._—The so-called coprolite bed, found near Farnham, in\r\nSurrey, and near Cambridge, contains nodules of phosphate of lime in\r\nsuch abundance as to be largely worked for the manufacture of\r\nartificial manure. It belongs to the upper part of the Chloritic\r\nseries, and is doubtless chiefly of animal origin, and may perhaps be\r\npartly coprolitic, derived from the excrement of fish and reptiles. The\r\nlate Mr. Barrett discovered in it, near Cambridge, in 1858, the remains\r\nof a bird, which was rather larger than the common pigeon, and probably\r\nof the order Natatores, and which, like most of the Gull tribe, had\r\nwell-developed wings. Portions of the metacarpus, metatarsus, tibia,\r\nand femur have been detected, and the determinations of Mr. Barrett\r\nhave been confirmed by Professor Owen.\r\n\r\nThis phosphatic bed in the suburbs of Cambridge must have been formed\r\npartly by the denudation of pre-existing rocks, mostly of Cretaceous\r\nage. The fossil shells and bones of animals washed out of these denuded\r\nstrata, now forming a layer only a few feet thick, have yielded a rich\r\nharvest to the collector. A large Rudist of the genus Radiolite, no\r\nless than two feet in height, may be seen in the Cambridge Museum,\r\nobtained from this bed. The number of reptilian remains, all apparently\r\nof Cretaceous age, is truly surprising; more than ten species of\r\nPterodactyl, five or six of Ichthyosaurus, one of Pliosaurus, one of\r\nDinosaurus, eight of Chelonians, besides other forms, having been\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nThe chloritic sand is regarded by many geologists as a littoral deposit\r\nof the Chalk Ocean, and therefore contemporaneous with part of the\r\nchalk marl, and even, perhaps, with some part of the white chalk. For,\r\nas the land went on sinking, and the cretaceous sea widened its area,\r\nwhite mud and chloritic sand were always forming somewhere, but the\r\nline of sea-shore was perpetually shifting its position. Hence, though\r\nboth sand and mud originated simultaneously, the one near the land, the\r\nother far from it, the sands in every locality where a shore became\r\nsubmerged might constitute the underlying deposit.\r\n\r\nFig. 267: Ostrea columba. Chloritic sand. Fig. 268: Ostrea carinata.\r\nChalk marl and chloritic sand.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristic mollusca of the chloritic sand may be\r\nmentioned _Terebrirostra lyra_ (Fig. 269), _Plagiostoma Hoperi_ (Fig.\r\n271), _Pecten quinque-costatus_ (Fig. 270), and _Ostrea columba_ (Fig.\r\n267).\r\n\r\nFig. 269: Terebrirostra lyra. Chloritic sand. Fig. 270: Pecten\r\n5-costatus. White chalk and chloritic sand. Fig. 271: Plagiostoma\r\nHoperi. White chalk and chloritic sand.\r\n\r\nThe Cephalopoda are abundant, among which 40 species of Ammonites are\r\nnow known, 10 being peculiar to this subdivision, and the rest common\r\nto the beds immediately above or below.\r\n\r\nGault.—The lowest member of the Upper Cretaceous group, usually about\r\n100 feet thick in the S.E. of England, is provincially termed Gault. It\r\nconsists of a dark blue marl, sometimes intermixed with green sand.\r\nMany peculiar forms of cephalopoda, such as the _Hamite_ (Fig. 272),\r\nand _ Scaphite,_ with other fossils, characterise this formation,\r\nwhich, small as is its thickness, can be traced by its organic remains\r\nto distant parts of Europe, as, for example, to the Alps.\r\n\r\nFig. 272: Ancyloceras spinigerum. Near Folkestone.\r\nTwenty-one species of British Ammonites are recorded as found in the\r\nGault, of which only eight are peculiar to it, ten being common to the\r\noverlying Chloritic series.\r\n\r\nConnection between Upper and Lower Cretaceous Strata.—Blackdown\r\nBeds.—The break between the Upper and Lower Cretaceous formations will\r\nbe appreciated when it is stated that, although the Neocomian contains\r\n31 species of Ammonite, and the Gault, as we have seen, 21, there are\r\nonly three of those common to both divisions. Nevertheless, we may\r\nexpect the discovery in England, and still more when we extend our\r\nsurvey to the Continent, of beds of passage intermediate between the\r\nUpper and Lower Cretaceous. Even now the Blackdown beds in Devonshire,\r\nwhich rest immediately on Triassic strata, and which evidently belong\r\nto some part of the Cretaceous series, have been referred by some\r\ngeologists to the Upper group, by others to the Lower or Neocomian.\r\nThey resemble the Folkestone beds of the latter series in mineral\r\ncharacter, and 59 out of 156 of their fossil mollusca are common to\r\nthem; but they have also 16 species common to the Gault, and 20 to the\r\noverlying Chloritic series; and what is very important, out of seven\r\nAmmonites six are found also in the Gault and Chloritic series, only\r\none being peculiar to the Blackdown beds.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay has remarked that there is a stratigraphical break;\r\nfor in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, at those few points where there are\r\nexposures of junctions of the Gault and Neocomian, the surface of the\r\nlatter has been much eroded or denuded, while to the westward of the\r\ngreat chalk escarpment the unconformability of the two groups is\r\nequally striking. At Blackdown this unconformability is still more\r\nmarked, for though distant only 100 miles from Kent and Surrey, no\r\nformation intervenes between these beds and the Trias; all intermediate\r\ngroups, such as the Lower Neocomian and Oolite, having either not been\r\ndeposited or destroyed by denudation.\r\n\r\nFlora of the Upper Cretaceous Period.—As the Upper Cretaceous rocks of\r\nEurope are, for the most part, of purely marine origin, and formed in\r\ndeep water usually far from the nearest shore, land-plants of this\r\nperiod, as we might naturally have anticipated, are very rarely met\r\nwith. In the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Chapelle, however, an important\r\nexception occurs, for there certain white sands and laminated clays,\r\n400 feet in thickness, contain the remains of terrestrial plants in a\r\nbeautiful state of preservation. These beds are the equivalents of the\r\nwhite chalk and chalk marl of England, or Senonien of d’Orbigny,\r\nalthough the white siliceous sands of the lower beds, and the green\r\ngrains in the upper part of the formation, cause it to differ in\r\nmineral character from our white chalk.\r\n\r\nBeds of fine clay, with fossil plants, and with seams of lignite, and\r\neven perfect coal, are intercalated. Floating wood, containing\r\nperforating shells, such as Pholas and Gastrochoena, occur. There are\r\nlikewise a few beds of a yellowish-brown limestone, with marine shells,\r\nwhich enable us to prove that the lowest and highest plant-beds belong\r\nto one group. Among these shells are _Pecten quadricostatus,_ and\r\nseveral others which are common to the upper and lower part of the\r\nseries, and _ Trigonia limbata,_ D’Orbigny, a shell of the white chalk.\r\nOn the whole, the organic remains and the geological position of the\r\nstrata prove distinctly that in the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Chapelle a\r\ngulf of the ancient Cretaceous sea was bounded by land composed of\r\nDevonian rocks. These rocks consisted of quartzose and schistose beds,\r\nthe first of which supplied white sand and the other argillaceous mud\r\nto a river which entered the sea at this point, carrying down in its\r\nturbid waters much drift-wood and the leaves of plants. Occasionally,\r\nwhen the force of the river abated, marine shells of the genera\r\n_Trigonia, Turritella, Pecten,_ etc., established themselves in the\r\nsame area, and plants allied to _Zostera_ and _Fucus_ grew on the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe fossil plants of this member of the upper chalk at Aix have been\r\ndiligently collected and studied by Dr. Debey, and as they afford the\r\nonly example yet known of a terrestrial flora older than the Eocene, in\r\nwhich the great divisions of the vegetable kingdom are represented in\r\nnearly the same proportions as in our own times, they deserve\r\nparticular attention. Dr. Debey estimates the number of species as\r\namounting to more than two hundred, of which sixty-seven are\r\ncryptogamous, chiefly ferns, twenty species of which can be well\r\ndetermined, most of them being in fructification. The scars on the bark\r\nof one or two are supposed to indicate tree-ferns. Of thirteen genera\r\nthree are still existing, namely, _Gleichenia,_ now inhabiting the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, and New Holland; Lygodium, now spread extensively through\r\ntropical regions, but having some species which live in Japan and North\r\nAmerica; and _ Asplenium,_ a cosmopolite form. Among the phænogamous\r\nplants, the Conifers are abundant, the most common belonging to a genus\r\ncalled Cycadopteris by Debey, and hardly separable from Sequoia (or\r\nWellingtonia), of which both the cones and branches are preserved. When\r\nI visited Aix, I found the silicified wood of this plant very\r\nplentifully dispersed through the white sands in the pits near that\r\ncity. In one silicified trunk 200 rings of annual growth could be\r\ncounted. Species of Araucaria like those of Australia are also found.\r\nCycads are extremely rare, and of Monocotyledons there are but few. No\r\npalms have been recognised with certainty, but the genus Pandanus, or\r\nscrew pine, has been distinctly made out. The number of the\r\nDicotyledonous Angiosperms is the most striking feature in so ancient a\r\nflora.[3]\r\n\r\nAmong them we find the familiar forms of the Oak, Fig, and Walnut\r\n(Quercus, Ficus, and Juglans), of the last both the nuts and leaves;\r\nalso several genera of the Myrtaceæ. But the predominant order is the\r\nProteaceæ, of which there are between sixty and seventy supposed\r\nspecies, many of extinct genera, but some referred to the following\r\nliving forms—Dryandra, Grevillea, Hakea, Banksia, Persoonia—all now\r\nbelonging to Australia, and Leucospermum, species of which form small\r\nbushes at the Cape.\r\n\r\n  Brongniart.

Of insects, Dr.\r\nDebey has obtained about ten species of the families Curculionidæ and\r\nCarabidæ.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of the flora of Aix-la-Chapelle to the tertiary and\r\nliving floras in the proportional number of dicotyledonous angiosperms\r\nas compared to the gymnogens, is a subject of no small theoretical\r\ninterest, because we can now affirm that these Aix plants flourished\r\nbefore the rich reptilian fauna of the secondary rocks had ceased to\r\nexist. The Ichthyosaurus, Pterodactyl, and Mosasaurus were of coeval\r\ndate with the oak, the walnut, and the fig. Speculations have often\r\nbeen hazarded respecting a connection between the rarity of Exogens in\r\nthe older rocks and a peculiar state of the atmosphere. A denser air,\r\nit was suggested, had in earlier times been alike adverse to the\r\nwell-being of the higher order of flowering plants, and of the\r\nquick-breathing animals, such as mammalia and birds, while it was\r\nfavourable to a cryptogamic and gymnospermous flora, and to a\r\npredominance of reptile life. But we now learn that there is no\r\nincompatibility in the co-existence of a vegetation like that of the\r\npresent globe, and some of the most remarkable forms of the extinct\r\nreptiles of the age of gymnosperms.\r\n\r\nIf the passage seem at present to be somewhat sudden from the flora of\r\nthe Lower or Neocomian to that of the Upper Cretaceous period, the\r\nabruptness of the change will probably disappear when we are better\r\nacquainted with the fossil vegetation of the uppermost beds of the\r\nNeocomian and that of the lowest strata of the Gault or true Cretaceous\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nHippurite limestone.—_Difference between the Chalk of the North and\r\nSouth of Europe._—By the aid of the three tests, superposition, mineral\r\ncharacter, and fossils, the geologist has been enabled to refer to the\r\nsame Cretaceous period certain rocks in the north and south of Europe,\r\nwhich differ greatly both in their fossil contents and in their mineral\r\ncomposition and structure.\r\n\r\nFig. 273: Map.\r\nIf we attempt to trace the cretaceous deposits from England and France\r\nto the countries bordering the Mediterranean, we perceive, in the first\r\nplace, that in the neighbourhood of London and Paris they form one\r\ngreat continuous mass, the Straits of Dover being a trifling\r\ninterruption, a mere valley with chalk cliffs on both sides. We then\r\nobserve that the main body of the chalk which surrounds Paris stretches\r\nfrom Tours to near Poitiers (see Fig. 273, in which the shaded part\r\nrepresents chalk).\r\n\r\nBetween Poitiers and La Rochelle, the space marked A on the map\r\nseparates two regions of chalk. This space is occupied by the Oolite\r\nand certain other formations older than the Chalk and Neocomian, and\r\nhas been supposed by M. E. de Beaumont to have formed an island in the\r\nCretaceous sea. South of this space we again meet with rocks which we\r\nat once recognise to be cretaceous, partly from the chalky matrix and\r\npartly from the fossils being very similar to those of the white chalk\r\nof the north: especially certain species of the genera _Spatangus,\r\nAnanchytes, Cidarites, Nucula, Ostrea,_ _Gryphæa (Exogyra), Pecten,\r\nPlagiostoma (Lima), Trigonia, Catillus (Inoceramus),_ and\r\n_Terebratula._[4] But Ammonites, as M. d’Archiac observes, of which so\r\nmany species are met with in the chalk of the north of France, are\r\nscarcely ever found in the southern region; while the genera _Hamite,\r\nTurrilite,_ and _Scaphite,_ and perhaps _Belemnite,_ are entirely\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nFig. 274: Radiolites. White chalk of France. Fig. 275: Radiolites\r\nfoliaceus. White chalk of France.\r\n\r\nFig. 276: Hippurites organisans. Upper chalk:—chalk marl of Pyrenees?\r\nFig. 276: Hippurites organisans. Upper chalk:—chalk marl of\r\nPyrenees?[5]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, certain forms are common in the south which are rare\r\nor wholly unknown in the north of France. Among these may be mentioned\r\nmany _Hippurites, Sphærulites,_ and other members of that great family\r\nof mollusca called _Rudistes_ by Lamarck, to which nothing analogous\r\nhas been discovered in the living creation, but which is quite\r\ncharacteristic of rocks of the Cretaceous era in the south of France,\r\nSpain, Sicily, Greece, and other countries bordering the Mediterranean.\r\nThe species called _ Hippurites organisans_ (Fig. 276) is more abundant\r\nthan any other in the south of Europe; and the geologist should make\r\nhimself well acquainted with the cast of the interior, _d,_ which is\r\noften the only part preserved in many compact marbles of the Upper\r\nCretaceous period. The flutings on the interior of the Hippurite, which\r\nare represented on the cast by smooth, rounded longitudinal ribs, and\r\nin some individuals attain a great size and length, are wholly unlike\r\nthe markings on the exterior of the shell.\r\n\r\nCretaceous Rocks in the United States.—If we pass to the American\r\ncontinent, we find in the State of New Jersey a series of sandy and\r\nargillaceous beds wholly unlike in mineral character to our Upper\r\nCretaceous system; which we can, nevertheless, recognise as referable,\r\npalæontologically, to the same division.\r\n\r\nThat they were about the same age generally as the European chalk and\r\nNeocomian, was the conclusion to which Dr. Morton and Mr. Conrad came\r\nafter their investigation of the fossils in 1834. The strata consist\r\nchiefly of green sand and green marl, with an overlying coralline\r\nlimestone of a pale yellow colour, and the fossils, on the whole, agree\r\nmost nearly with those of the Upper European series, from the\r\nMaestricht beds to the Gault inclusive. I collected sixty shells from\r\nthe New Jersey deposits in 1841, five of which were identical with\r\nEuropean species—_Ostrea larva, O. vesicularis, Gryphæa costata, Pecten\r\nquinque-costatus, Belemnitella mucronata._ As some of these have the\r\ngreatest vertical range in Europe, they might be expected more than any\r\nothers to recur in distant parts of the globe. Even where the species\r\nwere different, the generic forms, such as the Baculite and certain\r\nsections of Ammonites, as also the _Inoceramus_ (see Fig. 252) and\r\nother bivalves, have a decidedly cretaceous aspect. Fifteen out of the\r\nsixty shells above alluded to were regarded by Professor Forbes as good\r\ngeographical representatives of well-known cretaceous fossils of\r\nEurope. The correspondence, therefore, is not small, when we reflect\r\nthat the part of the United States where these strata occur is between\r\n3000 and 4000 miles distant from the chalk of Central and Northern\r\nEurope, and that there is a difference of ten degrees in the latitude\r\nof the places compared on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Fish of the\r\ngenera _Lamna, Galeus,_ and _ Carcharodon_ are common to New Jersey and\r\nthe European cretaceous rocks. So also is the genus _Mosasaurus_ among\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the labours of Dr. Newberry and others, that the\r\nCretaceous strata of the United States east and west of the\r\nAppalachians are characterised by a flora decidedly analogous to that\r\nof Aix-la-Chapelle above-mentioned, and therefore having considerable\r\nresemblance to the vegetation of the Tertiary and Recent Periods.\r\n\r\n [1] For particulars of structure see p. 318.\r\n\r\n [2] Geol.

Brongniart are much cited, it may be useful to geologists to\r\n give a table explaining the corresponding names of groups so much\r\n spoken of in palæontology.\r\n\r\n [4] D’Archiac, Sur la form.

These beds, which\r\nare without any marine equivalent in this country, appear completely to\r\nbridge over the interval between the Neocomian and the Oolites. They\r\nmay, perhaps, as suggested by Mr. Judd, be of the same age as part of\r\nthe Wealden series.\r\n\r\nUPPER NEOCOMIAN.\r\n\r\nFolkstone and Hythe Beds.—The sands which crop out beneath the Gault in\r\nWiltshire, Surrey, and Sussex are sometimes in the uppermost part pure\r\nwhite, at others of a yellow and ferruginous colour, and some of the\r\nbeds contain much green matter. At Folkestone they contain layers of\r\ncalcareous matter and chert, and at Hythe, in the neighbourhood, as\r\nalso at Maidstone and other parts of Kent, the limestone called Kentish\r\nRag is intercalated. This somewhat clayey and calcareous stone forms\r\nstrata two feet thick, alternating with quartzose sand. The total\r\nthickness of these Folkestone and Hythe beds is less than 300 feet, and\r\nthey are seen to rest immediately on a grey clay, to which we shall\r\npresently allude as the Atherfield clay. Among the fossils of the\r\nFolkestone and Hythe beds we may mention _Nautilus plicatus_ (Fig.\r\n277), _ Ancyloceras (Scaphites) gigas_ (Fig. 278), which has been aptly\r\ndescribed as an Ammonite more or less uncoiled; _Trigonia caudata_\r\n(Fig. 280), _Gervillia anceps_ (Fig. 279), a bivalve genus allied to\r\nAvicula, and _Terebratula sella_ (Fig. 281). In ferruginous beds of the\r\nsame age in Wiltshire is found a remarkable shell called _Diceras\r\nLonsdalii_ (Fig. 282), which abounds in the Upper and Middle Neocomian\r\nof Southern Europe. This genus is closely allied to Chama, and the cast\r\nof the interior has been compared to the horns of a goat.\r\n\r\nFig. 277: Nautilus licatus. Fig. 278: Ancyloceras gigas. Fig. 279:\r\nGervillia anceps. Fig. 280: Trigonia caudata.\r\n\r\nAtherfield Clay.—We mentioned before that the Folkstone and Hythe\r\nseries rest on a grey clay. This clay is only of slight thickness in\r\nKent and Surrey, but acquires great dimensions at Atherfield, in the\r\nIsle of Wight. The difference, indeed, in mineral character and\r\nthickness of the Upper Neocomian formation near Folkestone, and the\r\ncorresponding beds in the south of the Isle of Wight, about 100 miles\r\ndistant, is truly remarkable. In the latter place we find no limestone\r\nanswering to the Kentish Rag, and the entire thickness from the bottom\r\nof the Atherfield clay to the top of the Neocomian, instead of being\r\nless than 300 feet as in Kent, is given by the late Professor E. Forbes\r\nas 843 feet, which he divides into sixty-three strata, forming three\r\ngroups. The uppermost of these consists of ferruginous sands, the\r\nsecond of sands and clay, and the third or lowest of a brown clay,\r\nabounding in fossils.\r\n\r\nFig. 281: Terebratula sella. Fig. 282: Diceras Lonsdalii. a. The\r\nbivavle shell, b. Cast of one of the valves enlarged.\r\n\r\nPebbles of quartzose sandstone, jasper, and flinty slate, together with\r\ngrains of chlorite and mica, and, as Mr. Godwin-Austen has shown,\r\nfragments and water-worn fossils of the oolitic rocks, speak plainly of\r\nthe nature of the pre-existing formations, by the wearing down of which\r\nthe Neocomian beds were formed. The land, consisting of such rocks, was\r\ndoubtless submerged before the origin of the white chalk, a deposit\r\nwhich was formed in a more open sea, and in clearer waters.\r\n\r\nFig. 283: Perna mulleti.\r\nAmong the shells of the Atherfield clay the biggest and most abundant\r\nshell is the large _Perna Mulleti,_ of which a reduced figure is given\r\nin Fig. 283.\r\n\r\n_Similarity of Conditions causing Reappearance of Species._—Some\r\nspecies of mollusca and other fossils range through the whole series,\r\nwhile others are confined to particular subdivisions, and Forbes laid\r\ndown a law which has since been found of very general application in\r\nregard to estimating the chronological relations of consecutive strata.\r\nWhenever similar conditions, he says, are repeated, the same species\r\nreappear, provided too great a lapse of time has not intervened;\r\nwhereas if the length of the interval has been geologically great, the\r\nsame genera will reappear represented by distinct species. Changes of\r\ndepth, or of the mineral nature of the sea-bottom, the presence or\r\nabsence of lime or of peroxide of iron, the occurrence of a muddy, or a\r\nsandy, or a gravelly bottom, are marked by the banishment of certain\r\nspecies and the predominance of others. But these differences of\r\nconditions being mineral, chemical, and local in their nature, have no\r\nnecessary connection with the extinction, throughout a large area, of\r\ncertain animals or plants. When the forms proper to loose sand or soft\r\nclay, or to perfectly clear water, or to a sea of moderate or great\r\ndepth, recur with all the same species, we may infer that the interval\r\nof time has been, geologically speaking, small, however dense the mass\r\nof matter accumulated. But if, the genera remaining the same, the\r\nspecies are changed, we have entered upon a new period; and no\r\nsimilarity of climate, or of geographical and local conditions, can\r\nthen recall the old species which a long series of destructive causes\r\nin the animate and inanimate world has gradually annihilated.\r\n\r\nFig. 284: Ammonites Deshayesii.\r\n\r\nSpeeton Clay, Upper Division.—On the coast, beneath the white chalk of\r\nFlamborough Head, in Yorkshire, an argillaceous formation crops out,\r\ncalled the Speeton clay, several hundred feet in thickness, the\r\npalæontological relations of which have been ably worked out by Mr.\r\nJohn W. Judd,[1] and he has shown that it is separable into three\r\ndivisions, the uppermost of which, 150 feet thick, and containing 87\r\nspecies of mollusca, decidedly belongs to the Atherfield clay and\r\nassociated strata of Hythe and Folkestone, already described. It is\r\ncharacterised by the _Perna Mulleti_ (Fig. 283) and _Terebratula sella_\r\n(Fig. 281), and by _ Ammonites Deshayesii_ (Fig. 284), a well-known\r\nHythe fossil. Fine skeletons of reptiles of the genera Pliosaurus and\r\nTeleosaurus have been obtained from this clay. At the base of this\r\nupper division of the Speeton clay there occurs a layer of large\r\nSeptaria, formerly worked for the manufacture of cement. This bed is\r\ncrowded with fossils, especially Ammonites, one species of which, three\r\nfeet in diameter, was observed by Mr. Judd.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE NEOCOMIAN.\r\n\r\nTealby Series.—At Tealby, a village in the Lincolnshire Wolds, there\r\ncrop out beneath the white chalk some non-fossiliferous ferruginous\r\nsands about twenty-feet thick, beneath which are beds of clay and\r\nlimestone, about fifty feet thick, with an interesting suite of\r\nfossils, among which are _ Pecten cinctus_ (Fig. 285), from 9 to 12\r\ninches in diameter, _ Ancyloceras Duvallei_ (Fig. 286), and some forty\r\nother shells, many of them common to the Middle Speeton clay, about to\r\nbe mentioned. Mr. Judd remarks that as _Ammonites clypeiformis_ and\r\n_Terebratula hippopus_ characterise the Middle Neocomian of the\r\nContinent, it is to this stage that the Tealby series containing the\r\nsame fossils may be assigned.[2]\r\n\r\nFig. 285: Pecten cinctus. Fig. 286: Ancyloceras (Crioceras) Duvallei.\r\n\r\nThe middle division of the Speeton clay, occurring at Speeton below the\r\ncement-bed, before alluded to, is 150 feet thick, and contains about 39\r\nspecies of mollusca, half of which are common to the overlying clay.\r\nAmong the peculiar shells, _Pecten cinctus_ (Fig. 285) and _Ancyloceras\r\n(Crioceras) Duvallei_ (Fig. 286) occur.\r\n\r\nLOWER NEOCOMIAN.\r\n\r\nIn the lower division of the Speeton clay, 200 feet thick, 46 species\r\nof mollusca have been found, and three divisions, each characterised by\r\nits peculiar ammonite, have been noticed by Mr. Judd. The central zone\r\nis marked by _Ammonites Noricus_ (see Fig. 287). On the Continent these\r\nbeds are well-known by their corresponding fossils, the Hils clay and\r\nconglomerate of the north of Germany agreeing with the Middle and Lower\r\nSpeeton, the latter of which, with the same mineral characters and\r\nfossils as in Yorkshire, is also found in the little island of\r\nHeligoland. Yellow limestone, which I have myself seen near Neuchatel,\r\nin Switzerland, represents the Lower Neocomian at Speeton.\r\n\r\nFig. 287: Ammonites Noricus.\r\n\r\nWEALDEN FORMATION.\r\n\r\nBeneath the Atherfield clay or Upper Neocomian of the S.E. of England,\r\na fresh-water formation is found, called the Wealden, which, although\r\nit occupies a small horizontal area in Europe, as compared to the White\r\nChalk and the marine Neocomian beds, is nevertheless of great\r\ngeological interest, since the imbedded remains give us some insight\r\ninto the nature of the terrestrial fauna and flora of the Lower\r\nCretaceous epoch. The name of Wealden was given to this group because\r\nit was first studied in parts of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, called the\r\nWeald; and we are indebted to Dr. Mantell for having shown, in 1822, in\r\nhis “Geology of Sussex,” that the whole group was of fluviatile origin.\r\nIn proof of this he called attention to the entire absence of\r\nAmmonites, Belemnites, Brachiopoda, Echinodermata, Corals, and other\r\nmarine fossils, so characteristic of the Cretaceous rocks above, and of\r\nthe Oolitic strata below, and to the presence in the Weald of Paludinæ,\r\nMelaniæ, Cyrenæ, and various fluviatile shells, as well as the bones of\r\nterrestrial reptiles and the trunks and leaves of land-plants.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of so unexpected a fact as that of a dense mass of purely\r\nfresh-water origin underlying a deep-sea deposit (a phenomenon with\r\nwhich we have since become familiar) was received, at first, with no\r\nsmall doubt and incredulity. But the relative position of the beds is\r\nunequivocal; the Weald Clay being distinctly seen to pass beneath the\r\nAtherfield Clay in various parts of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex, and to\r\nreappear in the Isle of Wight at the base of the Cretaceous series,\r\nbeing, no doubt, continuous far beneath the surface, as indicated by\r\nthe dotted lines in Fig. 288. They are also found occupying the same\r\nrelative position below the chalk in the peninsula of Purbeck,\r\nDorsetshire, where, as we shall see in the sequel, they repose on\r\nstrata referable to the Upper Oolite.\r\n\r\n_Weald Clay._—The Upper division, or Weald Clay, is, in great part, of\r\nfresh-water origin, but in its highest portion contains beds of oysters\r\nand other marine shells which indicate fluvio-marine conditions. The\r\nuppermost beds are not only conformable, as Dr. Fitton observes, to the\r\ninferior strata of the overlying Neocomian, but of similar mineral\r\ncomposition. To explain this, we may suppose that, as the delta of a\r\ngreat river was tranquilly subsiding, so as to allow the sea to\r\nencroach upon the space previously occupied by fresh-water, the river\r\nstill continued to carry down the same sediment into the sea. In\r\nconfirmation of this view it may be stated that the remains of the\r\n_Iguanodon Mantelli,_ a gigantic terrestrial reptile, very\r\ncharacteristic of the Wealden, has been discovered near Maidstone, in\r\nthe overlying Kentish Rag, or marine limestone of the Upper Neocomian.\r\nHence we may infer that some of the saurians which inhabited the\r\ncountry of the great river continued to live when part of the district\r\nhad become submerged beneath the sea. Thus, in our own times, we may\r\nsuppose the bones of large alligators to be frequently entombed in\r\nrecent fresh-water strata in the delta of the Ganges. But if part of\r\nthat delta should sink down so as to be covered by the sea, marine\r\nformations might begin to accumulate in the same space where\r\nfresh-water beds had previously been formed; and yet the Ganges might\r\nstill pour down its turbid waters in the same direction, and carry\r\nseaward the carcasses of the same species of alligator, in which case\r\ntheir bones might be included in marine as well as in subjacent\r\nfresh-water strata.\r\n\r\nFig. 288\r\n\r\nThe Iguanodon, first discovered by Dr. Mantell, was an herbivorous\r\nreptile, of which the teeth, though bearing a great analogy, in their\r\ngeneral form and crenated edges (see Figs. 289 _a_ and _b_), to the\r\nmodern Iguanas which now frequent the tropical woods of America and the\r\nWest Indies, exhibit many important differences. It appears that they\r\nhave often been worn by the process of mastication; whereas the\r\nexisting herbivorous reptiles clip and gnaw off the vegetable\r\nproductions on which they feed, but do not chew them. Their teeth\r\nfrequently present an appearance of having been chipped off, but never,\r\nlike the fossil teeth of the Iguanodon, have a flat ground surface (see\r\nFig. 290, _b_) resembling the grinders of herbivorous mammalia. Dr.\r\nMantell computes that the teeth and bones of this species which passed\r\nunder his examination during twenty years must have belonged to no less\r\nthan seventy-one distinct individuals, varying in age and magnitude\r\nfrom the reptile just burst from the egg, to one of which the femur\r\nmeasured twenty-four inches in circumference. Yet, notwithstanding that\r\nthe teeth were more numerous than any other bones, it is remarkable\r\nthat it was not until the relics of all these individuals had been\r\nfound, that a solitary example of part of a jaw-bone was obtained. Soon\r\nafterwards remains both of the upper and lower jaw were met with in the\r\nHastings beds in Tilgate Forest, near Cuckfield. In the same sands at\r\nHastings, Mr. Beckles found large tridactyle impressions which it is\r\nconjectured were made by the hind feet of this animal, on which it is\r\nascertained that there were only three well-developed toes.\r\n\r\nFig. 289 a, b: Tooth of Iguanodon Mantelli. Fig. 290: a. Partially worn\r\ntooth of young individual of the same; <i>b.</i> Crown of tooth in\r\nadult worn down.\r\n\r\nFig. 291: Cypris spinigera.\r\nOccasionally bands of limestone, called Sussex Marble, occur in the\r\nWeald Clay, almost entirely composed of a species of _ Paludina,_\r\nclosely resembling the common _P. vivipara_ of English rivers. Shells\r\nof the _Cypris,_ a genus of Crustaceans mentioned (p. 57) as abounding\r\nin lakes and ponds, are also plentifully scattered through the clays of\r\nthe Wealden, sometimes producing, like plates of mica, a thin\r\nlamination (see Fig. 292).\r\n\r\nFig. 292: Weald clay with Cyprides.\r\nHastings Sands.—This lower division of the Wealden consists of sand,\r\nsandstone, calciferous grit, clay, and shale; the argillaceous strata,\r\nnotwithstanding the name, predominating somewhat over the arenaceous,\r\nas will be seen by reference to the following table, drawn up by\r\nMessrs. Drew and Foster, of the Geological Survey of Great Britain:\r\n\r\n  Names of Subordinate\r\nFormations. Mineral Composition\r\nof the Strata. Thickness\r\nin feet. Hastings Sand Tunbridge Wells Sand Sandstone and\r\nloam 150 Wadhurst Clay Blue and brown shale and clay, with\r\na little calc-grit 100 Ashdown Sand Hard sand, with some beds of\r\ncalc-grit 160 Ashburnham Beds Mottled white and red clay, with\r\nsome sandstone 330\r\n\r\nThe picturesque scenery of the “High Rocks” and other places in the\r\nneighbourhood of Tunbridge Wells is caused by the steep natural cliffs,\r\nto which a hard bed of white sand, occurring in the upper part of the\r\nTunbridge Wells Sand, mentioned in the above table, gives rise. This\r\nbed of “rock-sand” varies in thickness from 25 to 48 feet. Large masses\r\nof it, which were by no means hard or capable of making a good\r\nbuilding-stone, form, nevertheless, projecting rocks with perpendicular\r\nfaces, and resist the degrading action of the river because, says Mr.\r\nDrew, they present a solid mass without planes of division. The\r\ncalcareous sandstone and grit of Tilgate Forest, near Cuckfield, in\r\nwhich the remains of the Iguanodon and Hylæosaurus were first found by\r\nDr. Mantell, constitute an upper member of the Tunbridge Wells Sand,\r\nwhile the “sand-rock” of the Hastings cliffs, about 100 feet thick, is\r\none of the lower members of the same. The reptiles, which are very\r\nabundant in this division, consist partly of saurians, referred by Owen\r\nand Mantell to eight genera, among which, besides those already\r\nenumerated, we find the Megalosaurus and Plesiosaurus. The Pterodactyl\r\nalso, a flying reptile, is met with in the same strata, and many\r\nremains of Chelonians of the genera _Trionyx_ and _Emys,_ now confined\r\nto tropical regions.\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the Wealden are chiefly referable to the Ganoid and\r\nPlacoid orders. Among them the teeth and scales of _ Lepidotus_ are\r\nmost widely diffused (see Fig. 293, next page). These ganoids were\r\nallied to the _Lepidosteus,_ or Gar-pike, of the American rivers. The\r\nwhole body was covered with large rhomboidal scales, very thick, and\r\nhaving the exposed part coated with enamel. Most of the species of this\r\ngenus are supposed to have been either river-fish, or inhabitants of\r\nthe sea at the mouth of estuaries.\r\n\r\nFig. 293: Lepidotus Mantelli, a. Palate and teeth, b. Side view of\r\nteeth, c. Scale.\r\n\r\nFig. 294: Unio Valdensis. Fig. 295: Under side of slab of sandstone\r\nabout one yard in diameter.\r\nAt different heights in the Hastings Sands, we find again and again\r\nslabs of sandstone with a strong ripple-mark, and between these slabs\r\nbeds of clay many yards thick. In some places, as at Stammerham,\r\nHorsham, near there, are indications of this clay having been exposed\r\nso as to dry and crack before the next layer was thrown down upon it.\r\nThe open cracks in the clay have served as moulds, of which casts have\r\nbeen taken in relief, and which are, therefore, seen on the lower\r\nsurface of the sandstone (see Fig. 295).\r\n\r\nNear the same place a reddish sandstone occurs in which are innumerable\r\ntraces of a fossil vegetable, apparently _ Sphenopteris,_ the stems and\r\nbranches of which are disposed as if the plants were standing erect on\r\nthe spot where they originally grew, the sand having been gently\r\ndeposited upon and around them; and similar appearances have been\r\nremarked in other places in this formation.[3] In the same division\r\nalso of the Wealden, at Cuckfield, is a bed of gravel or conglomerate,\r\nconsisting of water-worn pebbles of quartz and jasper, with rolled\r\nbones of reptiles. These must have been drifted by a current, probably\r\nin water of no great depth.\r\n\r\nFig. 296: Sphenopteris gracilis.\r\nFrom such facts we may infer that, notwithstanding the great thickness\r\nof this division of the Wealden, the whole of it was a deposit in water\r\nof a moderate depth, and often extremely shallow. This idea may seem\r\nstartling at first, yet such would be the natural consequence of a\r\ngradual and continuous sinking of the ground in an estuary or bay, into\r\nwhich a great river discharged its turbid waters. By each foot of\r\nsubsidence, the fundamental rock would be depressed one foot farther\r\nfrom the surface; but the bay would not be deepened, if newly-deposited\r\nmud and sand should raise the bottom one foot. On the contrary, such\r\nnew strata of sand and mud might be frequently laid dry at low water,\r\nor overgrown for a season by a vegetation proper to marshes.\r\n\r\nPunfield Beds, Brackish and Marine.—The shells of the Wealden beds\r\nbelong to the genera _Melanopsis, Melania, Paludina, Cyrena, Cyclas,\r\nUnio_ (see Fig. 294), and others, which inhabit rivers or lakes; but\r\none band has been found at Punfield, in Dorsetshire, indicating a\r\nbrackish state of the water, where the genera _Corbula, Mytilus,_ and\r\n_Ostrea_ occur; and in some places this bed becomes purely marine,\r\ncontaining some well-known Neocomian fossils, among which _Ammonites\r\nDeshayesii_ (Fig. 284) may be mentioned. Others are peculiar as\r\nBritish, but very characteristic of the Upper and Middle Neocomian of\r\nSpain, and among these the _ Vicarya Lujani_ (Fig. 297), a shell allied\r\nto Nerinea, is conspicuous.\r\n\r\nBy reference to table (p. 308) it will be seen that the Wealden beds\r\nare given as the fresh-water equivalents of the Marine Neocomian. The\r\nhighest part of them in England may, for reasons just given, be\r\nregarded as Upper Neocomian, while some of the inferior portions may\r\ncorrespond in age to the Middle and Lower divisions of that group. In\r\nfavour of this latter view, M. Marcou mentions that a fish called\r\n_Asteracanthus granulosus,_ occurring in the Tilgate beds, is\r\ncharacteristic of the lowest beds of the Neocomian of the Jura, and it\r\nis well known that _Corbula alata,_ common in the Ashburnham beds, is\r\nfound also at the base of the Neocomian of the Continent.\r\n\r\nFig. 297: Vicarya Lujani. Fig. 297: _Vicarya Lujani_, De Verneuil.[4]\r\nWealden, Punfield.\r\n\r\n_Area of the Wealden._—In regard to the geographical extent of the\r\nWealden, it cannot be accurately laid down, because so much of it is\r\nconcealed beneath the newer marine formations. It has been traced about\r\n320 English miles from west to east, from the coast of Dorsetshire to\r\nnear Boulogne, in France; and nearly 200 miles from north-west to\r\nsouth-east, from Surrey and Hampshire to Vassy, in France. If the\r\nformation be continuous throughout this space, which is very doubtful,\r\nit does not follow that the whole was contemporaneous; because, in all\r\nlikelihood, the physical geography of the region underwent frequent\r\nchanges throughout the whole period, and the estuary may have altered\r\nits form, and even shifted its place. Dr. Dunker, of Cassel, and H. von\r\nMeyer, in an excellent monograph on the Wealdens of Hanover and\r\nWestphalia, have shown that they correspond so closely, not only in\r\ntheir fossils, but also in their mineral characters, with the English\r\nseries, that we can scarcely hesitate to refer the whole to one great\r\ndelta. Even then, the magnitude of the deposit may not exceed that of\r\nmany modern rivers. Thus, the delta of the Quorra or Niger, in Africa,\r\nstretches into the interior for more than 170 miles, and occupies, it\r\nis supposed, a space of more than 300 miles along the coast, thus\r\nforming a surface of more than 25,000 square miles, or equal to about\r\none-half of England.[5] Besides, we know not, in such cases, how far\r\nthe fluviatile sediment and organic remains of the river and the land\r\nmay be carried out from the coast, and spread over the bed of the sea.\r\nI have shown, when treating of the Mississippi, that a more ancient\r\ndelta, including species of shells such as now inhabit Louisiana, has\r\nbeen upraised, and made to occupy a wide geographical area, while a\r\nnewer delta is forming;[6] and the possibility of such movements and\r\ntheir effects must not be lost sight of when we speculate on the origin\r\nof the Wealden.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked where the continent was placed, from the ruins of which\r\nthe Wealden strata were derived, and by the drainage of which a great\r\nriver was fed. If the Wealden was gradually going downward 1000 feet or\r\nmore perpendicularly, a large body of fresh-water would not continue to\r\nbe poured into the sea at the same point. The adjoining land, if it\r\nparticipated in the movement, could not escape being submerged. But we\r\nmay suppose such land to have been stationary, or even undergoing\r\ncontemporaneous slow upheaval. There may have been an ascending\r\nmovement in one region, and a descending one in a contiguous parallel\r\nzone of country. But even if that were the case, it is clear that\r\nfinally an extensive depression took place in that part of Europe where\r\nthe deep sea of the Cretaceous period was afterwards brought in.\r\n\r\n_Thickness of the Wealden._—In the Weald area itself, between the North\r\nand South Downs, fresh-water beds to the thickness of 1600 feet are\r\nknown, the base not being reached. Probably the thickness of the whole\r\nWealden series, as seen in Swanage Bay, cannot be estimated as less\r\nthan 2000 feet.\r\n\r\n_Wealden Flora._—The flora of the Wealden is characterised by a great\r\nabundance of Coniferæ, Cycadeæ, and Ferns, and by the absence of leaves\r\nand fruits of Dicotyledonous Angiosperms. The discovery in 1855, in the\r\nHastings beds of the Isle of Wight, of Gyrogonites, or spore-vessels of\r\nthe Chara, was the first example of that genus of plants, so common in\r\nthe tertiary strata, being found in a Secondary or Mesozoic rock.\r\n\r\n [1] Judd, Speeton clay, Quart.

These beds are for the most part\r\nof fresh-water origin, but the organic remains of some few intercalated\r\nbeds are marine, and show that the Purbeck series has a closer affinity\r\nto the Oolitic group, of which it may be considered as the newest or\r\nuppermost member.\r\n\r\nIn England generally, and in the greater part of Europe, both the\r\nWealden and Purbeck beds are wanting, and the marine cretaceous group\r\nis followed immediately, in the descending order, by another series\r\ncalled the Jurassic. In this term, the formations commonly designated\r\nas “the Oolite and Lias” are included, both being found in the Jura\r\nMountains. The Oolite was so named because in the countries where it\r\nwas first examined the limestones belonging to it had an Oolitic\r\nstructure (see p. 37). These rocks occupy in England a zone nearly\r\nthirty miles in average breadth, which extends across the island, from\r\nYorkshire in the north-east, to Dorsetshire in the south-west.

Lower _f._   Cornbrash and\r\nForest marble.\r\n_g._  Great Oolite and Stonesfield slate.\r\n_h._  Fuller’s earth.\r\n_i._   Inferior Oolite.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Oolitic system of the above table has usually the Kimmeridge\r\nclay for its base; the Middle Oolitic system, the Oxford clay. The\r\nLower system reposes on the Lias, an argillo-calcareous formation,\r\nwhich some include in the Lower Oolite, but which will be treated of\r\nseparately in the next chapter. Many of these subdivisions are\r\ndistinguished by peculiar organic remains; and, though varying in\r\nthickness, may be traced in certain directions for great distances,\r\nespecially if we compare the part of England to which the\r\nabove-mentioned type refers with the north-east of France and the Jura\r\nMountains adjoining. In that country, distant above 400 geographical\r\nmiles, the analogy to the accepted English type, notwithstanding the\r\nthinness or occasional absence of the clays, is more perfect than in\r\nYorkshire or Normandy.\r\n\r\nPhysical Geography.—The alternation, on a grand scale, of distinct\r\nformations of clay and limestone has caused the oolitic and liassic\r\nseries to give rise to some marked features in the physical outline of\r\nparts of England and France. Wide valleys can usually be traced\r\nthroughout the long bands of country where the argillaceous strata crop\r\nout; and between these valleys the limestones are observed, forming\r\nranges of hills or more elevated grounds. These ranges terminate\r\nabruptly on the side on which the several clays rise up from beneath\r\nthe calcareous strata.\r\n\r\nFig. 298: Configuration of surface.\r\n\r\nFig. 298 will give the reader an idea of the configuration of the\r\nsurface now alluded to, such as may be seen in passing from London to\r\nCheltenham, or in other parallel lines, from east to west, in the\r\nsouthern part of England. It has been necessary, however, in this\r\ndrawing, greatly to exaggerate the inclination of the beds, and the\r\nheight of the several formations, as compared to their horizontal\r\nextent. It will be remarked, that the lines of steep slope, or\r\nescarpment, face towards the west in the great calcareous eminences\r\nformed by the chalk and the Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolites; and at\r\nthe base of which we have respectively the Gault, Kimmeridge clay,\r\nOxford clay, and Lias. This last forms, generally, a broad vale at the\r\nfoot of the escarpment of inferior Oolite, but where it acquires\r\nconsiderable thickness, and contains solid beds of marlstone, it\r\noccupies the lower part of the escarpment.\r\n\r\nThe external outline of the country which the geologist observes in\r\ntravelling eastward from Paris to Metz, is precisely analogous, and is\r\ncaused by a similar succession of rocks intervening between the\r\ntertiary strata and the Lias; with this difference, however, that the\r\nescarpments of Chalk, Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolites face towards the\r\neast instead of the west. It is evident, therefore, that the denuding\r\ncauses (see p. 105) have acted similarly over an area several hundred\r\nmiles in diameter, removing the softer clays more extensively than the\r\nlimestones, and causing these last to form steep slopes or escarpments\r\nwherever the harder calcareous rock was based upon a more yielding and\r\ndestructible formation.\r\n\r\nUPPER OOLITE.\r\n\r\nPurbeck Beds.—These strata, which we class as the uppermost member of\r\nthe Oolite, are of limited geographical extent in Europe, as already\r\nstated, but they acquire importance when we consider the succession of\r\nthree distinct sets of fossil remains which they contain. Such repeated\r\nchanges in organic life must have reference to the history of a vast\r\nlapse of ages. The Purbeck beds are finely exposed to view in\r\nDurdlestone Bay, near Swanage, Dorsetshire, and at Lulworth Cove and\r\nthe neighbouring bays between Weymouth and Swanage. At Meup’s Bay, in\r\nparticular, Professor E. Forbes examined minutely, in 1850, the organic\r\nremains of this group, displayed in a continuous sea-cliff section, and\r\nit appears from his researches that the Upper, Middle, and Lower\r\nPurbecks are each marked by peculiar species of organic remains, these\r\nagain being different, so far as a comparison has yet been instituted,\r\nfrom the fossils of the overlying Hastings Sands and Weald Clay.\r\n\r\n_Upper Purbeck._—The highest of the three divisions is purely\r\nfresh-water, the strata, about fifty feet in thickness, containing\r\nshells of the genera _Paludina, Physa, Limnæa, Planorbis, Valvata,\r\nCyclas,_ and _Unio,_ with _ Cyprides_ and fish. All the species seem\r\npeculiar, and among these the _Cyprides_ are very abundant and\r\ncharacteristic (see Fig. 299, _a, b, c._)\r\n\r\nThe stone called “Purbeck Marble,” formerly much used in ornamental\r\narchitecture in the old English cathedrals of the southern counties, is\r\nexclusively procured from this division.\r\n\r\nFig. 299: Cyprides from the Upper Purbecks.\r\n\r\n_Middle Purbeck._—Next in succession is the Middle Purbeck, about\r\nthirty feet thick, the uppermost part of which consists of fresh-water\r\nlimestone, with cyprides, turtles, and fish, of different species from\r\nthose in the preceding strata. Below the limestone are brackish-water\r\nbeds full of _Cyrena,_ and traversed by bands abounding in _Corbula_\r\nand _ Melania._ These are based on a purely marine deposit, with _\r\nPecten, Modiola, Avicula,_ and _Thracia._ Below this, again, come\r\nlimestones and shales, partly of brackish and partly of fresh-water\r\norigin, in which many fish, especially species of _ Lepidotus_ and\r\n_Microdon radiatus,_ are found, and a crocodilian reptile named\r\n_Macrorhynchus._ Among the mollusks, a remarkable ribbed _Melania,_ of\r\nthe section _Chilina,_ occurs.\r\n\r\nFig. 300: Ostrea distorta. Fig. 301: Hemicidaris Purbeckensis.\r\n\r\nImmediately below is a great and conspicuous stratum, twelve feet\r\nthick, formed of a vast accumulation of shells of _Ostrea distorta_\r\n(Fig. 300), long familiar to geologists under the local name of\r\n“Cinder-bed.” In the uppermost part of this bed Professor Forbes\r\ndiscovered the first echinoderm (Fig. 301) as yet known in the Purbeck\r\nseries, a species of _ Hemicidaris,_ a genus characteristic of the\r\nOolitic period, and scarcely, if at all, distinguishable from a\r\npreviously known Oolitic fossil. It was accompanied by a species of\r\n_Perna._ Below the Cinder-bed fresh-water strata are again seen, filled\r\nin many places with species of _Cypris_ (Fig. 302, _a, b, c_), and with\r\n_Valvata, Paludina, Planorbis, Limnæa, Physa_ (Fig. 303), and _Cyclas,_\r\nall different from any occurring higher in the series. It will be seen\r\nthat _Cypris fasciculata_ (Fig. 302, _b_) has tubercles at the end only\r\nof each valve, a character by which it can be immediately recognised.\r\nIn fact, these minute crustaceans, almost as frequent in some of the\r\nshales as plates of mica in a micaceous sandstone, enable geologists at\r\nonce to identify the Middle Purbeck in places far from the Dorsetshire\r\ncliffs, as, for example, in the Vale of Wardour in Wiltshire. Thick\r\nbeds of chert occur in the Middle Purbeck filled with mollusca and\r\ncyprides of the genera already enumerated, in a beautiful state of\r\npreservation, often converted into chalcedony. Among these Professor\r\nForbes met with gyrogonites (the spore-vessels of _Chara_), plants\r\nnever until 1851 discovered in rocks older than the Eocene. About\r\ntwenty feet below the “Cinder-bed” is a stratum two or three inches\r\nthick, in which fossil mammalia presently to be mentioned occur, and\r\nbeneath this a thin band of greenish shales, with marine shells and\r\nimpressions of leaves like those of a large _Zostera,_ forming the base\r\nof the Middle Purbeck.\r\n\r\nFig. 302: Cyprides from the Middle Purbecks.\r\n\r\nFig. 303: Physa Bristovii\r\n\r\n_Fossil Mammalia of the Middle Purbeck._—In 1852,[1] after alluding to\r\nthe discovery of numerous insects and air-breathing mollusca in the\r\nPurbeck strata, I remarked that, although no mammalia had then been\r\nfound, “it was too soon to infer their non-existence on mere negative\r\nevidence.” Only two years after this remark was in print, Mr. W. R.\r\nBrodie found in the Middle Purbeck, about twenty feet below the\r\n“Cinder-bed” above alluded to, in Durdlestone Bay, portions of several\r\nsmall jaws with teeth, which Professor Owen recognised as belonging to\r\na small mammifer of the insectivorous class, more closely allied in its\r\ndentition to the _ Amphitherium_ (or _Thylacotherium_) than to any\r\nexisting type.\r\n\r\nFour years later (in 1856) the remains of several other species of\r\nwarm-blooded quadrupeds were exhumed by Mr. S. H. Beckles, F.R.S., from\r\nthe same thin bed of marl near the base of the Middle Purbeck. In this\r\nmarly stratum many reptiles, several insects, and some fresh-water\r\nshells of the genera _Paludina, Planorbis,_ and _Cyclas,_ were found.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckles had determined thoroughly to explore the thin layer of\r\ncalcareous mud from which in the suburbs of Swanage the bones of the\r\nSpalacotherium had already been obtained, and in three weeks he brought\r\nto light from an area forty feet long and ten wide, and from a layer\r\nthe average thickness of which was only five inches, portions of the\r\nskeletons of six new species of mammalia, as interpreted by Dr.\r\nFalconer, who first examined them. Before these interesting inquiries\r\nwere brought to a close, the joint labours of Professor Owen and Dr.\r\nFalconer had made it clear that twelve or more species of mammalia\r\ncharacterised this portion of the Middle Purbeck, most of them\r\ninsectivorous or predaceous, varying in size from that of a mole to\r\nthat of the common polecat, _Mustela putorius._ While the majority had\r\nthe character of insectivorous marsupials, Dr. Falconer selected one as\r\ndiffering widely from the rest, and pointed out that in certain\r\ncharacters it was allied to the living Kangaroo-rat, or _Hypsiprymnus,_\r\nten species of which now inhabit the prairies and scrub-jungle of\r\nAustralia, feeding on plants, and gnawing scratched-up roots. A\r\nstriking peculiarity of their dentition, one in which they differ from\r\nall other quadrupeds, consists in their having a single large\r\npre-molar, the enamel of which is furrowed with vertical grooves,\r\nusually seven in number.\r\n\r\nThe largest pre-molar (see Fig. 305) in the fossil genus exhibits in\r\nlike manner seven parallel grooves, producing by their termination a\r\nsimilar serrated edge in the crown; but their direction is diagonal—a\r\ndistinction, says Dr. Falconer, which is “trivial, not typical.” As\r\nthese oblique furrows form so marked a character of the majority of the\r\nteeth, Dr. Falconer gave to the fossil the generic name of _\r\nPlagiaulax._ The shape and relative size of the incisor, _ a,_ Fig.\r\n306, exhibit a no less striking similarity to Hypsiprymnus.\r\nNevertheless, the more sudden upward curve of this incisor, as well as\r\nother characters of the jaw, indicate a great deviation in the form of\r\nPlagiaulax from that of the living kangaroo-rats.\r\n\r\nFig. 304: Pre-molar of the recent Australian Hypsiprymnus Gaimardi,\r\nshowing 7 grooves at right angles to the length of the jaw. Fig. 305:\r\nThird and largest pre-molar (lower jaw) of Plagiaulax Becklesii,\r\nshowing 7 diagonal grooves.\r\n\r\nFig. 306: Plagiaulax Becklessi. Right ramus of lower jaw.\r\nThere are two fossil specimens of lower jaws of this genus evidently\r\nreferable to two distinct species extremely unequal in size and\r\notherwise distinguishable. The _Plagiaulax Becklesii_ (Fig. 306) was\r\nabout as big as the English squirrel or the flying phalanger of\r\nAustralia (_Petaurus Australis,_ Waterhouse). The smaller fossil,\r\nhaving only half the linear dimensions of the other, was probably only\r\none-twelfth of its bulk. It is of peculiar geological interest,\r\nbecause, as shown by Dr. Falconer, its two back molars bear a decided\r\nresemblance to those of the Triassic _ Microlestes_ (Fig. 389), the\r\nmost ancient of known mammalia, of which an account will be given in\r\nChapter XXI.\r\n\r\nUp to 1857 all the mammalian remains discovered in secondary rocks had\r\nconsisted solely of single branches of the lower jaw, but in that year\r\nMr. Beckles obtained the upper portion of a skull, and on the same slab\r\nthe lower jaw of another quadruped with eight molars, a large canine,\r\nand a broad and thick incisor. It has been named Triconodon from its\r\nbicuspid teeth, and is supposed to have been a small insectivorous\r\nmarsupial, about the size of a hedgehog. Other jaws have since been\r\nfound indicating a larger species of the same genus.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen has proposed the name of _Galestes_ for the largest of\r\nthe mammalia discovered in 1858 in Purbeck, equalling the polecat\r\n(_Mustela putorius_) in size. It is supposed to have been predaceous\r\nand marsupial.\r\n\r\nBetween forty and fifty pieces or sides of lower jaws with teeth have\r\nbeen found in oolitic strata in Purbeck; only five upper maxillaries,\r\ntogether with one portion of a separate cranium, occur at Stonesfield,\r\nand it is remarkable that with these there were no examples in Purbeck\r\nof an entire skeleton, nor of any considerable number of bones in\r\njuxtaposition. In several portions of the matrix there were detached\r\nbones, often much decomposed, and fragments of others apparently\r\nmammalian; but if all of them were restored, they would scarcely\r\nsuffice to complete the five skeletons to which the five upper\r\nmaxillaries above alluded to belonged. As the average number of pieces\r\nin each mammalian skeleton is about 250, there must be many thousands\r\nof missing bones; and when we endeavour to account for their absence,\r\nwe are almost tempted to indulge in speculations like those once\r\nsuggested to me by Dr. Buckland, when he tried to solve the enigma in\r\nreference to Stonesfield; “The corpses,” he said, “of drowned animals,\r\nwhen they float in a river, distended by gases during putrefaction,\r\nhave often their lower jaw hanging loose, and sometimes it has dropped\r\noff. The rest of the body may then be drifted elsewhere, and sometimes\r\nmay be swallowed entire by a predaceous reptile or fish, such as an\r\nichthyosaur or a shark.”\r\n\r\nAs all the above-mentioned Purbeck marsupials, belonging to eight or\r\nnine genera and to about fourteen species, insectivorous, predaceous,\r\nand herbivorous, have been obtained from an area less than 500 square\r\nyards in extent, and from a single stratum no more than a few inches\r\nthick, we may safely conclude that the whole lived together in the same\r\nregion, and in all likelihood they constituted a mere fraction of the\r\nmammalia which inhabited the lands drained by one river and its\r\ntributaries. They afford the first positive proof as yet obtained of\r\nthe co-existence of a varied fauna of the highest class of vertebrata\r\nwith that ample development of reptile life which marks all the periods\r\nfrom the Trias to the Lower Cretaceous inclusive, and with a\r\ngymnospermous flora, or that state of the vegetable kingdom when cycads\r\nand conifers predominated over all kinds of plants, except the ferns,\r\nso far, at least, as our present imperfect knowledge of fossil botany\r\nentitles us to speak.\r\n\r\nThe following table will enable the reader to see at a glance how\r\nconspicuous a part, numerically considered, the mammalian species of\r\nthe Middle Purbeck now play when compared with those of other\r\nformations more ancient than the Paris gypsum, and, at the same time,\r\nit will help him to appreciate the enormous hiatus in the history of\r\nfossil mammalia which at present occurs between the Eocene and Purbeck\r\nperiods, and between the latter and the Stonesfield Oolite, and between\r\nthis again and the Trias.\r\n\r\n_Number and Distribution of all the known Species of Fossil Mammalia\r\nfrom Strata older than the Paris Gypsum, or than the Bembridge Series\r\nof the Isle of Wight._\r\n\r\nTERTIARY Headon Series and beds between the Paris Gypsum and the\r\nGrès de Beauchamp 14 10 English\r\n   4 French Barton Clay and Sables de Beauchamp 0 Bagshot Beds,\r\n   Calcaire Grossier, and Upper Soissonnais of\r\n   Cuisse-Lamotte 20 16 French\r\n   1 English\r\n   3 U.

Hébert to be of about that age, have yielded at La\r\nFere the _Arctocyon (Palæocyon) primævus,_ the oldest known tertiary\r\nmammal.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice, that in the Hastings Sands there are certain\r\nlayers of clay and sandstone in which numerous footprints of quadrupeds\r\nhave been found by Mr. Beckles, and traced by him in the same set of\r\nrocks through Sussex and the Isle of Wight. They appear to belong to\r\nthree or four species of reptiles, and no one of them to any\r\nwarm-blooded quadruped. They ought, therefore, to serve as a warning to\r\nus, when we fail in like manner to detect mammalian footprints in older\r\nrocks (such as the New Red Sandstone), to refrain from inferring that\r\nquadrupeds, other than reptilian, did not exist or pre-exist.\r\n\r\nBut the most instructive lesson read to us by the Purbeck strata\r\nconsists in this: They are all, with the exception of a few\r\nintercalated brackish and marine layers, of fresh-water origin; they\r\nare 160 feet in thickness, have been well searched by skillful\r\ncollectors, and by the late Edward Forbes in particular, who studied\r\nthem for months consecutively. They have been numbered, and the\r\ncontents of each stratum recorded separately, by the officers of the\r\nGeological Survey of Great Britain. They have been divided into three\r\ndistinct groups by Forbes, each characterised by the same genera of\r\npulmoniferous mollusca and cyprides, these genera being represented in\r\neach group by different species; they have yielded insects of many\r\norders, and the fruits of several plants; and lastly, they contain\r\n“dirt-beds,” or old terrestrial surfaces and vegetable soils at\r\ndifferent levels, in some of which erect trunks and stumps of cycads\r\nand conifers, with their roots still attached to them, are preserved.\r\nYet when the geologist inquires if any land-animals of a higher grade\r\nthan reptiles lived during any one of these three periods, the rocks\r\nare all silent, save one thin layer a few inches in thickness; and this\r\nsingle page of the earth’s history has suddenly revealed to us in a few\r\nweeks the memorials of so many species of fossil mammalia, that they\r\nalready outnumber those of many a subdivision of the tertiary series,\r\nand far surpass those of all the other secondary rocks put together!\r\n\r\n_Lower Purbeck._—Beneath the thin marine band mentioned at p. 324 as\r\nthe base of the Middle Purbeck, some purely fresh-water marls occur,\r\ncontaining species of _Cypris_ (Fig. 307 _a, c_), _Valvata,_ and\r\n_Limnæa,_ different from those of the Middle Purbeck. This is the\r\nbeginning of the inferior division, which is about 80 feet thick. Below\r\nthe marls are seen, at Meup’s Bay, more than thirty feet of\r\nbrackish-water strata, abounding in a species of _Serpula,_ allied to,\r\nif not identical with, _Serpula coacervites,_ found in beds of the same\r\nage in Hanover. There are also shells of the genus _ Rissoa_ (of the\r\nsubgenus _Hydrobia_), and a little _ Cardium_ of the subgenus\r\n_Protocardium,_ in these marine beds, together with _Cypris._ Some of\r\nthe cypris-bearing shales are strangely contorted and broken up, at the\r\nwest end of the Isle of Purbeck. The great dirt-bed or vegetable soil\r\ncontaining the roots and stools of _Cycadeæ,_ which I shall presently\r\ndescribe, underlies these marls, and rests upon the lowest fresh-water\r\nlimestone, a rock about eight feet thick, containing _Cyclas, Valvata,_\r\nand _Limnæa,_ of the same species as those of the uppermost part of the\r\nLower Purbeck, or above the dirt-bed. The fresh-water limestone in its\r\nturn rests upon the top beds of the Portland stone, which, although it\r\ncontains purely marine remains, often consists of a rock\r\nundistinguishable in mineral character from the Lowest Purbeck\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nFig. 307: Cyprides from the Lower Purbeck.\r\nFig. 308: Mantellia nidiformis.\r\n_Dirt-bed or ancient Surface-soil._—The most remarkable of all the\r\nvaried succession of beds enumerated in the above list is that called\r\nby the quarrymen “the dirt,” or “black dirt,” which was evidently an\r\nancient vegetable soil. It is from 12 to 18 inches thick, is of a dark\r\nbrown or black colour, and contains a large proportion of earthy\r\nlignite. Through it are dispersed rounded and sub-angular fragments of\r\nstone, from 3 to 9 inches in diameter, in such numbers that it almost\r\ndeserves the name of gravel. I also saw in 1866, in Portland, a smaller\r\ndirt-bed six feet below the principal one, six inches thick, consisting\r\nof brown earth with upright _Cycads_ of the same species, _Mantellia\r\nnidiformis,_ as those found in the upper bed, but no _Coniferæ._ The\r\nweight of the incumbent strata squeezing down the compressible dirt-bed\r\nhas caused the _Cycads_ to assume that form which has led the quarrymen\r\nto call them “petrified birds’ nests,” which suggested to Brongniart\r\nthe specific name of _nidiformis._ I am indebted to Mr. Carruthers for\r\nFigure 308 of one of these Purbeck specimens, in which the original\r\ncylindrical figure has been less distorted than usual by pressure.\r\n\r\nMany silicified trunks of coniferous trees, and the remains of plants\r\nallied to _Zamia_ and _Cycas,_ are buried in this dirt-bed, and must\r\nhave become fossil on the spots where they grew. The stumps of the\r\ntrees stand erect for a height of from one to three feet, and even in\r\none instance to six feet, with their roots attached to the soil at\r\nabout the same distances from one another as the trees in a modern\r\nforest. The carbonaceous matter is most abundant immediately around the\r\nstumps, and round the remains of fossil _Cycadeæ._\r\n\r\nBesides the upright stumps above mentioned, the dirt-bed contains the\r\nstems of silicified trees laid prostrate. These are partly sunk into\r\nthe black earth, and partly enveloped by a calcareous slate which\r\ncovers the dirt-bed. The fragments of the prostrate trees are rarely\r\nmore than three or four feet in length; but by joining many of them\r\ntogether, trunks have been restored, having a length from the root to\r\nthe branches of from 20 to 23 feet, the stems being undivided for 17 or\r\n20 feet, and then forked. The diameter of these near the root is about\r\none foot; but I measured one myself, in 1866, which was 3½ feet in\r\ndiameter, said by the quarrymen to be unusually large. Root-shaped\r\ncavities were observed by Professor Henslow to descend from the bottom\r\nof the dirt-bed into the subjacent fresh-water stone, which, though now\r\nsolid, must have been in a soft and penetrable state when the trees\r\ngrew. The thin layers of calcareous slate (Fig. 309) were evidently\r\ndeposited tranquilly, and would have been horizontal but for the\r\nprotrusion of the stumps of the trees, around the top of each of which\r\nthey form hemispherical concretions.\r\n\r\nFig. 309: Section in Isle of Portland, Dorset.\r\n\r\nThe dirt-bed is by no means confined to the island of Portland, where\r\nit has been most carefully studied, but is seen in the same relative\r\nposition in the cliffs east of Lulworth Cove, in Dorsetshire, where, as\r\nthe strata have been disturbed, and are now inclined at an angle of\r\n45°, the stumps of the trees are also inclined at the same angle in an\r\nopposite direction—a beautiful illustration of a change in the position\r\nof beds originally horizontal (see Fig. 310).\r\n\r\nFig. 310: Section of cliff east of Lulworth Cove.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts above described we may infer, first, that those beds of\r\nthe Upper Oolite, called “the Portland,” which are full of marine\r\nshells, were overspread with fluviatile mud, which became dry land, and\r\ncovered by a forest, throughout a portion of the space now occupied by\r\nthe south of England, the climate being such as to permit the growth of\r\nthe _Zamia_ and _Cycas._ Secondly. This land at length sank down and\r\nwas submerged with its forests beneath a body of fresh-water, from\r\nwhich sediment was thrown down enveloping fluviatile shells. Thirdly.\r\nThe regular and uniform preservation of this thin bed of black earth\r\nover a distance of many miles, shows that the change from dry land to\r\nthe state of a fresh-water lake or estuary, was not accompanied by any\r\nviolent denudation, or rush of water, since the loose black earth,\r\ntogether with the trees which lay prostrate on its surface, must\r\ninevitably have been swept away had any such violent catastrophe taken\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe forest of the dirt-bed, as before hinted, was not everywhere the\r\nfirst vegetation which grew in this region. Besides the lower bed\r\ncontaining upright _Cycadeæ,_ before mentioned, another has sometimes\r\nbeen found above it, which implies oscillations in the level of the\r\nsame ground, and its alternate occupation by land and water more than\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions of the Purbeck._—It will be observed that the division of\r\nthe Purbecks into upper, middle, and lower, was made by Professor\r\nForbes strictly on the principle of the entire distinctness of the\r\nspecies of organic remains which they include. The lines of demarkation\r\nare not lines of disturbance, nor indicated by any striking physical\r\ncharacters or mineral changes. The features which attract the eye in\r\nthe Purbecks, such as the dirt-beds, the dislocated strata at Lulworth,\r\nand the Cinder-bed, do not indicate any breaks in the distribution of\r\norganised beings. “The causes which led to a complete change of life\r\nthree times during the deposition of the fresh-water and brackish\r\nstrata must,” says this naturalist, “be sought for, not simply in\r\neither a rapid or a sudden change of their area into land or sea, but\r\nin the great lapse of time which intervened between the epochs of\r\ndeposition at certain periods during their formation.”\r\n\r\nEach dirt-bed may, no doubt, be the memorial of many thousand years or\r\ncenturies, because we find that two or three feet of vegetable soil is\r\nthe only monument which many a tropical forest has left of its\r\nexistence ever since the ground on which it now stands was first\r\ncovered with its shade. Yet, even if we imagine the fossil soils of the\r\nLower Purbeck to represent as many ages, we need not be surprised to\r\nfind that they do not constitute lines of separation between strata\r\ncharacterised by different zoological types. The preservation of a\r\nlayer of vegetable soil, when in the act of being submerged, must be\r\nregarded as a rare exception to a general rule. It is of so perishable\r\na nature, that it must usually be carried away by the denuding waves or\r\ncurrents of the sea, or by a river; and many Purbeck dirt-beds were\r\nprobably formed in succession and annihilated, besides those few which\r\nnow remain.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the Purbeck beds, so far as our knowledge extends at\r\npresent, consist chiefly of Ferns, Coniferæ, and Cycadeæ (Fig. 308),\r\nwithout any angiosperms; the whole more allied to the Oolitic than to\r\nthe Cretaceous vegetation. The same affinity is indicated by the\r\nvertebrate and invertebrate animals. Mr. Brodie has found the remains\r\nof beetles and several insects of the homopterous and trichopterous\r\norders, some of which now live on plants, while others are of such\r\nforms as hover over the surface of our present rivers.\r\n\r\nPortland Oolite and Sand (_b,_ Table p. 321).—The Portland Oolite has\r\nalready been mentioned as forming in Dorsetshire the foundation on\r\nwhich the fresh-water limestone of the Lower Purbeck reposes (see p.\r\n331). It supplies the well-known building-stone of which St. Paul’s and\r\nso many of the principal edifices of London are constructed. About\r\nfifty species of mollusca occur in this formation, among which are some\r\nammonites of large size. The cast of a spiral univalve called by the\r\nquarrymen the “Portland screw” (_a,_ Figure 311), is common; the shell\r\nof the same (_b_) being rarely met with. Also _Trigonia gibbosa_ (Fig.\r\n313) and _Cardium dissimile_ (Fig. 314). This upper member rests on a\r\ndense bed of sand, called the Portland Sand, containing similar marine\r\nfossils, below which is the Kimmeridge Clay. In England these Upper\r\nOolite formations are almost wholly confined to the southern counties.\r\nBut some fragments of them occur beneath the Neocomian or Speeton Clay\r\non the coast of Yorkshire, containing many more fossils common to the\r\nPortlandian of the Continent than does the same formation in\r\nDorsetshire. Corals are rare in this formation, although one species is\r\nfound plentifully at Tisbury, Wiltshire, in the Portland Sand,\r\nconverted into flint and chert, the original calcareous matter being\r\nreplaced by silex (Fig. 312).\r\n\r\nFig. 311: Cerithium Portlandicum.\r\nFig. 312: Isastræa oblonga. Fig. 313: Trigonia gibbosa.\r\n\r\nKimmeridge Clay.—The _Kimmeridge Clay_ consists, in great part, of a\r\nbituminous shale, sometimes forming an impure coal, several hundred\r\nfeet in thickness. In some places in Wiltshire it much resembles peat;\r\nand the bituminous matter may have been, in part at least, derived from\r\nthe decomposition of vegetables. But as impressions of plants are rare\r\nin these shales, which contain ammonites, oysters, and other marine\r\nshells, with skeletons of fish and saurians, the bitumen may perhaps be\r\nof animal origin. Some of the saurians (Pliosaurus) in Dorsetshire are\r\namong the most gigantic of their kind.\r\n\r\nFig. 314: Cardium dissimile. Fig. 315: Ostrea expansa. Fig. 316:\r\nCardium striatulum. Fig. 317: Ostrea deltoidea. Fig. 318: Gryphæa\r\n(Exogyra) virgula.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossils, amounting to nearly 100 species, may be mentioned\r\n_Cardium striatulum_ (Fig. 316) and _Ostrea deltoidea_ (Fig. 317), the\r\nlatter found in the Kimmeridge Clay throughout England and the north of\r\nFrance, and also in Scotland, near Brora. The _Gryphæa virgula_ (Fig.\r\n318), also met with in the Kimmeridge Clay near Oxford, is so abundant\r\nin the Upper Oolite of parts of France as to have caused the deposit to\r\nbe termed “marnes à gryphées virgules.” Near Clermont, in Argonne, a\r\nfew leagues from St. Menehould, where these indurated marls crop out\r\nfrom beneath the Gault, I have seen them, on decomposing, leave the\r\nsurface of every ploughed field literally strewed over with this fossil\r\noyster.\r\n\r\nFig. 319: Trigonellites latus.\r\nThe _Trigonellites latus_ (_Aptychus_ of some authors) (Fig. 319) is\r\nalso widely dispersed through this clay. The real nature of the shell,\r\nof which there are many species in oolitic rocks, is still a matter of\r\nconjecture. Some are of opinion that the two plates have been the\r\ngizzard of a cephalopod; others, that it may have formed a bivalve\r\noperculum of the same.\r\n\r\nSolenhofen Stone.—The celebrated lithographic stone of Solenhofen in\r\nBavaria, appears to be of intermediate age between the Kimmeridge clay\r\nand the Coral Rag, presently to be described. It affords a remarkable\r\nexample of the variety of fossils which may be preserved under\r\nfavourable circumstances, and what delicate impressions of the tender\r\nparts of certain animals and plants may be retained where the sediment\r\nis of extreme fineness. Although the number of testacea in this slate\r\nis small, and the plants few, and those all marine, count Munster had\r\ndetermined no less than 237 species of fossils when I saw his\r\ncollection in 1833; and among them no less than seven _species_ of\r\nflying reptiles or pterodactyls (see Fig. 320), six saurians, three\r\ntortoises, sixty species of fish, forty-six of crustacea, and\r\ntwenty-six of insects. These insects, among which is a libellula, or\r\ndragon-fly, must have been blown out to sea, probably from the same\r\nland to which the pterodactyls, and other contemporaneous\r\nair-breathers, resorted.\r\n\r\nFig. 320: Skeleton of Pterodactylus crassirostris.\r\n\r\nIn the same slate of Solenhofen a fine example was met with in 1862 of\r\nthe skeleton of a bird almost entire, and retaining even its feathers\r\nso perfect that the vanes as well as the shaft are preserved. The head\r\nwas at first supposed to be wanting, but Mr. Evans detected on the slab\r\nwhat seems to be the impression of the cranium and beak, much\r\nresembling in size and shape that of the jay or woodcock. This valuable\r\nspecimen is now in the British Museum, and has been called by Professor\r\nOwen _Archæopteryx macrura._ Although anatomists agree that it is a\r\ntrue bird, yet they also find that in the length of the bones of the\r\ntail, and some other minor points of its anatomy, it approaches more\r\nnearly to reptiles than any known living bird. In the living\r\nrepresentatives of the class Aves, the tail-feathers are attached to a\r\ncoccygian bone, consisting of several vertebræ united together, whereas\r\nin the Archæopteryx the tail is composed of twenty vertebræ, each of\r\nwhich supports a pair of quill-feathers. The first five only of the\r\nvertebræ, as seen in A, have transverse processes, the fifteen\r\nremaining ones become gradually longer and more tapering. The feathers\r\ndiverge outward from them at an angle of 45°.\r\n\r\nFig. 321: Tail and feather of Archæopteryx, from Solenhofen, and tail\r\nof living bird for comparison.\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley in his late memoirs on the order of reptiles called\r\nDinosaurians, which are largely represented in all the formations, from\r\nthe Neocomian to the Trias inclusive, has shown that they present in\r\ntheir structure many remarkable affinities to birds. But a reptile\r\nabout two feet long, called Compsognathus, lately found in the\r\nStonesfield slate, makes a much greater approximation to the class Aves\r\nthan any Dinosaur, and therefore forms a closer link between the\r\nclasses Aves and Reptilia than does the Archæopteryx.\r\n\r\nIt appears doubtful whether any species of British fossil, whether of\r\nthe vertebrate or invertebrate class, is common to the Oolite and\r\nChalk. But there is no similar break or discordance as we proceed\r\ndownward, and pass from one to another of the several leading members\r\nof the Jurassic group, the Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolite, and the\r\nLias, there being often a considerable proportion of the mollusca,\r\nsometimes as much as a fourth, common to such divisions as the Upper\r\nand Middle Oolite.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE OOLITE.\r\n\r\nCoral Rag.—One of the limestones of the Middle Oolite has been called\r\nthe “Coral Rag,” because it consists, in part, of continuous beds of\r\npetrified corals, most of them retaining the position in which they\r\ngrew at the bottom of the sea. In their forms they more frequently\r\nresemble the reef-building polyparia of the Pacific than do the corals\r\nof any other member of the Oolite. They belong chiefly to the genera\r\n_Thecosmilia_ (Fig. 322), _Protoseris,_ and _Thamnastræa,_ and\r\nsometimes form masses of coral fifteen feet thick.\r\n\r\nFig. 322: Thecosmilia annularis. Fig. 323: Thamnastræa.\r\n\r\nFig. 324: Ostrea gregaria. Fig. 325: Nerinæa Goodhallii.\r\nIn Fig. 323 of a _Thamnastræa_ from this formation, it will be seen\r\nthat the cup-shaped cavities are deepest on the right-hand side, and\r\nthat they grow more and more shallow, until those on the left side are\r\nnearly filled up. The last-mentioned stars are supposed to represent a\r\nperfected condition, and the others an immature state. These coralline\r\nstrata extend through the calcareous hills of the north-west of\r\nBerkshire, and north of Wilts, and again recur in Yorkshire, near\r\nScarborough. The _ Ostrea gregarea_ (Fig. 324) is very characteristic\r\nof the formation in England and on the Continent.\r\n\r\nOne of the limestones of the Jura, referred to the age of the English\r\nCoral Rag, has been called “Nerinæan limestone” (Calcaire à Nérinées)\r\nby M. Thirria; _Nerinæa_ being an extinct genus of univalve shells\r\n(Fig. 325) much resembling the _Cerithium_ in external form. The\r\nsection shows the curious and continuous ridges on the columnella and\r\nwhorls.\r\n\r\nOxford Clay.—The coralline limestone, or “Coral Rag,” above described,\r\nand the accompanying sandy beds, called “calcareous grits,” of the\r\nMiddle Oolite, rest on a thick bed of clay, called the “Oxford Clay,”\r\nsometimes not less than 600 feet thick. In this there are no corals,\r\nbut great abundance of cephalopoda, of the genera Ammonite and\r\nBelemnite (Figs. 326 and 327). In some of the finely laminated clays\r\nammonites are very perfect, although somewhat compressed, and are\r\nfrequently found with the lateral lobe extended on each side of the\r\nopening of the mouth into a horn-like projection (Figure 327). These\r\nwere discovered in the cuttings of the Great Western Railway, near\r\nChippenham, in 1841, and have been described by Mr. Pratt (_An. Nat.\r\nHist.,_ Nov., 1841).\r\n\r\nFig. 326: Belemnites hastatus. Fig. 327: Ammonites Jason.\r\n\r\nSimilar elongated processes have been also observed to extend from the\r\nshells of some Belemnites discovered by Dr. Mantell in the same clay\r\n(see Figure 328), who, by the aid of this and other specimens, has been\r\nable to throw much light on the structure of singular extinct forms of\r\ncuttle-fish.[3]\r\n\r\nKelloway Rock.—The arenaceous limestone which passes under this name is\r\ngenerally grouped as a member of the Oxford clay, in which it forms, in\r\nthe south-west of England, lenticular masses, 8 or 10 feet thick,\r\ncontaining at Kelloway, in Wiltshire, numerous casts of ammonites and\r\nother shells. But in Yorkshire this calcareo-arenaceous formation\r\nthickens to about 30 feet, and constitutes the lower part of the Middle\r\nOolite, extending inland from Scarborough in a southerly direction. The\r\nnumber of mollusca which it contains is, according to Mr. Etheridge,\r\n143, of which only 34, or 23½ per cent, are common to the Oxford clay\r\nproper. Of the 52 Cephalopoda, 15 (namely 13 species of ammonite, the\r\n_Ancyloceras Calloviense_ and one Belemnite) are common to the Oxford\r\nClay, giving a proportion of nearly 30 per cent.\r\n\r\nFig. 328: Belemnites Puzosianus.\r\n\r\nLOWER OOLITE.\r\n\r\nCornbrash and Forest Marble.—The upper division of this series, which\r\nis more extensive than the preceding or Middle Oolite, is called in\r\nEngland the Cornbrash, as being a brashy, easily broken rock, good for\r\ncorn land. It consists of clays and calcareous sandstones, which pass\r\ndownward into the Forest Marble, an argillaceous limestone, abounding\r\nin marine fossils. In some places, as at Bradford, this limestone is\r\nreplaced by a mass of clay. The sandstones of the Forest Marble of\r\nWiltshire are often ripple-marked and filled with fragments of broken\r\nshells and pieces of drift-wood, having evidently been formed on a\r\ncoast. Rippled slabs of fissile oolite are used for roofing, and have\r\nbeen traced over a broad band of country from Bradford in Wilts, to\r\nTetbury in Gloucestershire. These calcareous tile-stones are separated\r\nfrom each other by thin seams of clay, which have been deposited upon\r\nthem, and have taken their form, preserving the undulating ridges and\r\nfurrows of the sand in such complete integrity, that the impressions of\r\nsmall footsteps, apparently of crustaceans, which walked over the soft\r\nwet sands, are still visible. In the same stone the claws of crabs,\r\nfragments of echini, and other signs of a neighbouring beach, are\r\nobserved.[4]\r\n\r\nGreat (or Bath) Oolite.—Although the name of Coral Rag has been\r\nappropriated, as we have seen, to a member of the Middle Oolite before\r\ndescribed, some portions of the Lower Oolite are equally entitled in\r\nmany places to be called coralline limestones. Thus the Great Oolite\r\nnear Bath contains various corals, among which the _Eunomia radiata_\r\n(Fig. 329) is very conspicuous, single individuals forming masses\r\nseveral feet in diameter; and having probably required, like the large\r\nexisting brain-coral (_Meandrina_) of the tropics, many centuries\r\nbefore their growth was completed.\r\n\r\nFig. 329: Eunomia radiata.\r\n\r\nDifferent species of crinoids, or stone-lilies, are also common in the\r\nsame rocks with corals; and, like them, must have enjoyed a firm\r\nbottom, where their base of attachment remained undisturbed for years\r\n(_c,_ Fig. 330). Such fossils, therefore, are almost confined to the\r\nlimestones; but an exception occurs at Bradford, near Bath, where they\r\nare enveloped in clay sometimes 60 feet thick. In this case, however,\r\nit appears that the solid upper surface of the “Great Oolite” had\r\nsupported, for a time, a thick submarine forest of these beautiful\r\nzoophytes, until the clear and still water was invaded by a current\r\ncharged with mud, which threw down the stone-lilies, and broke most of\r\ntheir stems short off near the point of attachment. The stumps still\r\nremain in their original position; but the numerous articulations, once\r\ncomposing the stem, arms, and body of the encrinite, were scattered at\r\nrandom through the argillaceous deposit in which some now lie\r\nprostrate. These appearances are represented in the section _b,_ Fig.\r\n330, where the darker strata represent the Bradford clay, which is\r\nhowever a formation of such local development that in many places it\r\ncannot easily be separated from the clays of the overlying\r\n“forest-marble” and underlying “fuller’s earth.” The upper surface of\r\nthe calcareous stone below is completely incrusted over with a\r\ncontinuous pavement, formed by the stony roots or attachments of the\r\nCrinoidea; and besides this evidence of the length of time they had\r\nlived on the spot, we find great numbers of single joints, or circular\r\nplates of the stem and body of the encrinite, covered over with\r\n_serpulæ._ Now these _serpulæ_ could only have begun to grow after the\r\ndeath of some of the stone-lilies, parts of whose skeletons had been\r\nstrewed over the floor of the ocean before the irruption of\r\nargillaceous mud. In some instances we find that, after the parasitic\r\n_serpulæ_ were full grown, they had become incrusted over with a\r\nbryozoan, called _Diastopora diluviana_ (see _b,_ Fig. 331); and many\r\ngenerations of these molluscoids had succeeded each other in the pure\r\nwater before they became fossil.\r\n\r\nFig. 330: Apiocrinites rotundus, or Pear Eucrinite.\r\n\r\nFig. 331: a. Aingle plate of body of Apiocrinus, overgrown with serpulæ\r\nand bryozoa; b. Portion of same magnified, showing the bryozoan\r\nDiastopora diluviana covering one of the serpulæ.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, perceive distinctly that, as the pines and cycadeous\r\nplants of the ancient “dirt-bed,” or fossil forest, of the Lower\r\nPurbeck were killed by submergence under fresh water, and soon buried\r\nbeneath muddy sediment, so an invasion of argillaceous matter put a\r\nsudden stop to the growth of the Bradford Encrinites, and led to their\r\npreservation in marine strata.\r\n\r\nSuch differences in the fossils as distinguish the calcareous and\r\nargillaceous deposits from each other, would be described by\r\nnaturalists as arising out of a difference in the _stations_ of\r\nspecies; but besides these, there are variations in the fossils of the\r\nhigher, middle, and lower part of the oolitic series, which must be\r\nascribed to that great law of change in organic life by which distinct\r\nassemblages of species have been adapted, at successive geological\r\nperiods, to the varying conditions of the habitable surface. In a\r\nsingle district it is difficult to decide how far the limitation of\r\nspecies to certain minor formations has been due to the local influence\r\nof _stations,_ or how far it has been caused by time or the law of\r\nvariation above alluded to. But we recognise the reality of the\r\nlast-mentioned influence, when we contrast the whole oolitic series of\r\nEngland with that of parts of the Jura, Alps, and other distant\r\nregions, where, although there is scarcely any lithological\r\nresemblance, yet some of the same fossils remain peculiar in each\r\ncountry to the Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolite formations respectively.\r\nMr. Thurmann has shown how remarkably this fact holds true in the\r\nBernese Jura, although the argillaceous divisions, so conspicuous in\r\nEngland, are feebly represented there, and some entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous portion of the Great Oolite consists of several shelly\r\nlimestones, one of which, called the Bath Oolite, is much celebrated as\r\na building-stone. In parts of Gloucestershire, especially near\r\nMinchinhampton, the Great Oolite, says Mr. Lycett, “must have been\r\ndeposited in a shallow sea, where strong currents prevailed, for there\r\nare frequent changes in the mineral character of the deposit, and some\r\nbeds exhibit false stratification. In others, heaps of broken shells\r\nare mingled with pebbles of rocks foreign to the neighbourhood, and\r\nwith fragments of abraded madrepores, dicotyledonous wood, and crabs’\r\nclaws. The shelly strata, also, have occasionally suffered denudation,\r\nand the removed portions have been replaced by clay.” In such\r\nshallow-water beds shells of the genera _Patella, Nerita, Rimula,\r\nCylindrites_ are common (see Figs. 334 to 337); while cephalopods are\r\nrare, and instead of ammonites and belemnites, numerous genera of\r\ncarnivorous trachelipods appear. Out of 224 species of univalves\r\nobtained from the Minchinhampton beds, Mr. Lycett found no less than 50\r\nto be carnivorous. They belong principally to the genera _Buccinum,\r\nPleurotoma, Rostellaria, Murex, Purpuroidea_ (Fig. 333), and Fusus, and\r\nexhibit a proportion of zoophagous species not very different from that\r\nwhich obtains in seas of the Recent period. These zoological results\r\nare curious and unexpected, since it was imagined that we might look in\r\nvain for the carnivorous trachelipods in rocks of such high antiquity\r\nas the Great Oolite, and it was a received doctrine that they did not\r\nbegin to appear in considerable numbers till the Eocene period, when\r\nthose two great families of cephalopoda, the ammonites and belemnites,\r\nand a great number of other representatives of the same class of\r\nchambered shells, had become extinct.\r\n\r\nFig. 332: Terebratula digona. Fig. 333: Purpuroidea nodulata. Fig. 334:\r\nCylindrites acutus. Fig. 335: Patella rugosa. Fig. 336: Nerita\r\ncostulata. Fig. 337: Rimula (Emarginula) clathrata.\r\n\r\nStonesfield Slate: Mammalia.—The slate of Stonesfield has been shown by\r\nMr. Lonsdale to lie at the base of the Great Oolite.[5] It is a\r\nslightly oolitic shelly limestone, forming large lenticular masses\r\nimbedded in sand only six feet thick, but very rich in organic remains.\r\nIt contains some pebbles of a rock very similar to itself, and which\r\nmay be portions of the deposit, broken up on a shore at low water or\r\nduring storms, and redeposited. The remains of belemnites, trigoniæ,\r\nand other marine shells, with fragments of wood, are common, and\r\nimpressions of ferns, cycadeæ, and other plants. Several insects, also,\r\nand, among the rest, the elytra or wing-covers of beetles, are\r\nperfectly preserved (see Fig. 338), some of them approaching nearly to\r\nthe genus Buprestis. The remains, also, of many genera of reptiles,\r\nsuch as _Plesiosaur, Crocodile,_ and _ Pterodactyl,_ have been\r\ndiscovered in the same limestone.\r\n\r\nFig. 338: Elytron of Buprestis?\r\nBut the remarkable fossils for which the Stonesfield slate is most\r\ncelebrated are those referred to the mammiferous class. The student\r\nshould be reminded that in all the rocks described in the preceding\r\nchapters as older than the Eocene, no bones of any land-quadruped, or\r\nof any cetacean, had been discovered until the _Spalacotherium_ of the\r\nPurbeck beds came to light in 1854. Yet we have seen that terrestrial\r\nplants were not wanting in the Upper Cretaceous formation (see p. 302),\r\nand that in the Wealden there was evidence of fresh-water sediment on a\r\nlarge scale, containing various plants, and even ancient vegetable\r\nsoils. We had also in the same Wealden many land-reptiles and winged\r\ninsects, which render the absence of terrestrial quadrupeds the more\r\nstriking. The want, however, of any bones of whales, seals, dolphins,\r\nand other aquatic mammalia, whether in the chalk or in the upper or\r\nmiddle oolite, is certainly still more remarkable.\r\n\r\nThese observations are made to prepare the reader to appreciate more\r\njustly the interest felt by every geologist in the discovery in the\r\nStonesfield slate of no less than ten specimens of lower jaws of\r\nmammiferous quadrupeds, belonging to four different species and to\r\nthree distinct genera, for which the names of _ Amphitherium,\r\nPhascolotherium,_ and _Stereognathus_ have been adopted.\r\n\r\nFig. 339: Tupaia Tana. Right ramus of lower jaw.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that these or really the remains of\r\nmammalia (although it was at first suggested that they might be\r\nreptiles), and the only question open to controversy is limited to this\r\npoint, whether the fossil mammalia found in the Lower Oolite of\r\nOxfordshire ought to be referred to the marsupial quadrupeds, or to the\r\nordinary placental series. Cuvier had long ago pointed out a\r\npeculiarity in the form of the angular process (_c,_ Figs. 342 and 343)\r\nof the lower jaw, as a character of the genus _Didelphys_; and\r\nProfessor Owen has since confirmed the doctrine of its generality in\r\nthe entire marsupial series. In all these pouched quadrupeds this\r\nprocess is turned inward, as at _c, d,_ Fig. 342, in the Brazilian\r\nopossum, whereas in the placental series, as at _c,_ Figs. 340 and 341,\r\nthere is an almost entire absence of such inflection. The _Tupaia Tana_\r\nof Sumatra has been selected by Mr. Waterhouse for this illustration,\r\nbecause the jaws of that small insectivorous quadruped bear a great\r\nresemblance to those of the Stonesfield _Amphitherium._ By clearing\r\naway the matrix from the specimen of _Amphitherium Prevostii_ here\r\nrepresented (Fig. 344), Professor Owen ascertained that the angular\r\nprocess (_c_) bent inward in a slighter degree than in any of the known\r\nmarsupialia; in short, the inflection does not exceed that of the mole\r\nor hedgehog. This fact made him doubt whether the _Amphitherium_ might\r\nnot be an insectivorous placental, although it offered some points of\r\napproximation in its osteology to the marsupials, especially to the\r\n_Myrmecobius,_ a small insectivorous quadruped of Australia, which has\r\nnine molars on each side of the lower jaw, besides a canine and three\r\nincisors.[6] Another species of _Amphitherium_ has been found at\r\nStonesfield (Fig. 345), which differs from the former (Fig. 344)\r\nprincipally in being larger.\r\n\r\nFig. 340: Part of lower jaw of Tupaia Tana. Fig. 341: Side view of\r\nsame. Fig. 342: Part of lower jaw of Didelphys Azaræ. Fig. 343: Side\r\nview of same. Fig. 344: Amphitherium Prevostii.\r\n\r\nFig. 344: Amphitherium Prevostii.\r\n\r\nFig. 345: Amphitherium Broderipii. Fig. 346: Phascolotherium\r\nBucklandii.\r\n\r\nThe second mammiferous genus discovered in the same slates was named\r\noriginally by Mr. Broderip _Didelphys Bucklandi_ (see Fig. 346), and\r\nhas since been called _Phascolotherium_ by Owen. It manifests a much\r\nstronger likeness to the marsupials in the general form of the jaw, and\r\nin the extent and position of its inflected angle, while the agreement\r\nwith the living genus Didelphys in the number of the pre-molar and\r\nmolar teeth is complete.[7]\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the remains of another mammifer, small in size, but larger than\r\nany of those previously known, was brought to light. The generic name\r\nof _Stereognathus_ was given to it, and, as is usually the case in\r\nthese old rocks (see p. 328), it consisted of part of a lower jaw, in\r\nwhich were implanted three double-fanged teeth, differing in structure\r\nfrom those of all other known recent or extinct mammals.\r\n\r\nPlants of the Oolite.—The Araucarian pines, which are now abundant in\r\nAustralia and its islands, together with marsupial quadrupeds, are\r\nfound in like manner to have accompanied the marsupials in Europe\r\nduring the Oolitic period (see Fig. 348). In the same rock endogens of\r\nthe most perfect structure are met with, as, for example, fruits allied\r\nto the Pandanus, such as the _Kaidacarpum ooliticum_ of Carruthers in\r\nthe Great Oolite, and the _Podocarya_ of Buckland (see Fig. 347) in the\r\nInferior Oolite.\r\n\r\nFuller’s Earth.—Between the Great and Inferior Oolite near Bath, an\r\nargillaceous deposit, called “the fuller’s earth,” occurs; but it is\r\nwanting in the north of England. It abounds in the small oyster\r\nrepresented in Fig. 349. The number of mollusca known in this deposit\r\nis about seventy; namely, fifty Lamellibranchiate Bivalves, ten\r\nBrachiopods, three Gasteropods, and seven or eight Cephalopods.\r\n\r\nFig. 347: Portion of a fossil fruit of Podocarya Bucklandii. Fig. 348:\r\nCone of fossil Araucaria sphærocarpa.\r\n\r\nFig. 349: Ostrea acuminata.\r\nInferior Oolite.—This formation consists of a calcareous freestone,\r\nusually of small thickness, but attaining in some places, as in the\r\ntypical area of Cheltenham and the Western Cotswolds, a thickness of\r\n250 feet. It sometimes rests upon yellow sands, formerly classed as the\r\nsands of the Inferior Oolite, but now regarded as a member of the Upper\r\nLias. These sands repose upon the Upper Lias clays in the south and\r\nwest of England. The Collyweston slate, formerly classed with the Great\r\nOolite, and supposed to represent in Northamptonshire the Stonesfield\r\nslate, is now found to belong to the Inferior Oolite, both by community\r\nof species and position in the series. The Collyweston beds, on the\r\nwhole, assume a much more marine character than the Stonesfield slate.\r\nNevertheless, one of the fossil plants _Aroides Stutterdi,_ Carruthers,\r\nremarkable, like the Pandanaceous species before mentioned (Fig. 347)\r\nas a representative of the monocotyledonous class, is common to the\r\nStonesfield beds in Oxfordshire.\r\n\r\nThe Inferior Oolite of Yorkshire consists largely of shales and\r\nsandstones, which assume much the aspect of a true coal-field, thin\r\nseams of coal having actually been worked in them for more than a\r\ncentury. A rich harvest of fossil ferns has been obtained from them, as\r\nat Gristhorpe, near Scarborough (Fig. 350). They contain also Cycadeæ,\r\nof which family a magnificent specimen has been described by Mr.\r\nWilliamson under the name Zamia gigas, and a fossil called _Equisetum\r\nColumnare_ (see Fig. 397), which maintains an upright position in\r\nsandstone strata over a wide area. Shells of _Estheria_ and _Unio,_\r\ncollected by Mr. Bean from these Yorkshire coal-bearing beds, point to\r\nthe estuary or fluviatile origin of the deposit.\r\n\r\nFig. 350: Hemitelites Brownii.\r\nAt Brora, in Sutherlandshire, a coal formation, probably coeval with\r\nthe above, or at least belonging to some of the lower divisions of the\r\nOolitic period, has been mined extensively for a century or more. It\r\naffords the thickest stratum of pure vegetable matter hitherto detected\r\nin any secondary rock in England. One seam of coal of good quality has\r\nbeen worked three and a half feet thick, and there are several feet\r\nmore of pyritous coal resting upon it.\r\n\r\nFig. 351: Terebratula fimbria. Fig. 352: Rhynchonella spinosa. Fig.\r\n353: Pholadomya fidicula.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristic shells of the Inferior Oolite, I may instance\r\n_Terebratula fimbria_ (Fig. 351), _Rhynchonella spinosa_ (Fig. 352),\r\nand _Pholadomya fidicula_ (Fig. 353). The extinct genus _Pleurotomaria_\r\nis also a form very common in this division as well as in the Oolitic\r\nsystem generally. It resembles the _Trochus_ in form, but is marked by\r\na deep cleft (_a,_ Figs. 354, 355) on one side of the mouth. The\r\n_Collyrites (Dysaster) ringens_ (Fig. 356) is an Echinoderm common to\r\nthe Inferior Oolite of England and France, as are the two Ammonites\r\n(Figs. 357, 358).\r\n\r\nFig. 354: Pleurotomaria granulata.

Fig. 359: Ostrea Marshii.\r\n\r\nPalæontological Relations of the Oolitic Strata.—Observations have\r\nalready been made on the distinctness of the organic remains of the\r\nOolitic and Cretaceous strata, and the proportion of species common to\r\nthe different members of the Oolite. Between the Lower Oolite and the\r\nLias there is a somewhat greater break, for out of 256 mollusca of the\r\nUpper Lias, thirty-seven species only pass up into the Inferior Oolite.\r\n\r\nFig. 360: Ammonites macrocephalus.\r\nIn illustration of shells having a great vertical range, it may be\r\nstated that in England some few species pass up from the Lower to the\r\nUpper Oolite, as, for example, _Rhynchonella obsoleta, Lithodomus\r\ninclusus, Pholadomya ovalis,_ and _Trigonia costata._\r\n\r\nOf all the Jurassic Ammonites of Great Britain, _A. macrocephalus_\r\n(Fig. 360), which is common to the Great Oolite and Oxford Clay, has\r\nthe widest range.\r\n\r\nWe have every reason to conclude that the gaps which occur, both\r\nbetween the larger and smaller sections of the English Oolites, imply\r\nintervals of time, elsewhere represented by fossiliferous strata,\r\nalthough no deposit may have taken place in the British area. This\r\nconclusion is warranted by the partial extent of many of the minor and\r\nsome of the larger divisions even in England.\r\n\r\n [1] Elements of Geology, 4th edition.\r\n\r\n [2] I allude to several Zeuglodons found in Alabama, and referred by\r\n some zoologists to three species.\r\n\r\n [3] See Phil.

The peculiar aspect which is most characteristic\r\nof the Lias in England, France, and Germany, is an alternation of thin\r\nbeds of blue or grey limestone, having a surface which becomes\r\nlight-brown when weathered, these beds being separated by\r\ndark-coloured, narrow argillaceous partings, so that the quarries of\r\nthis rock, at a distance, assume a striped and ribbon-like appearance.\r\n\r\nThe Lias has been divided in England into three groups, the Upper,\r\nMiddle, and Lower. The Upper Lias consists first of sands, which were\r\nformerly regarded as the base of the Oolite, but which, according to\r\nDr. Wright, are by their fossils more properly referable to the Lias;\r\nsecondly, of clay shale and thin beds of limestone. The Middle Lias, or\r\nmarl-stone series, has been divided into three zones; and the Lower\r\nLias, according to the labours of Quenstedt, Oppel, Strickland, Wright,\r\nand others, into seven zones, each marked by its own group of fossils.\r\nThis Lower Lias averages from 600 to 900 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nFrom Devon and Dorsetshire to Yorkshire all these divisions, observes\r\nProfessor Ramsay, are constant; and from top to bottom we cannot assert\r\nthat anywhere there is actual unconformity between any two\r\nsubdivisions, whether of the larger or smaller kind.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of the English Lias there are at present known about 937\r\nspecies of mollusca, and of these 267 are Cephalopods, of which class\r\nmore than two-thirds are Ammonites, the Nautilus and Belemnite also\r\nabounding. The whole series has been divided by zones characterised by\r\nparticular Ammonites; for while other families of shells pass from one\r\ndivision to another in numbers varying from about 20 to 50 per cent,\r\nthese cephalopods are almost always limited to single zones, as\r\nQuenstedt and Oppel have shown for Germany, and Dr. Wright and others\r\nfor England.\r\n\r\nAs no actual unconformity is known from the top of the Upper to the\r\nbottom of the Lower Lias, and as there is a marked uniformity in the\r\nmineral character of almost all the strata, it is somewhat difficult to\r\naccount even for such partial breaks as have been alluded to in the\r\nsuccession of species, if we reject the hypothesis that the old species\r\nwere in each case destroyed at the close of the deposition of the rocks\r\ncontaining them, and replaced by the creation of new forms when the\r\nsucceeding formation began. I agree with Professor Ramsay in not\r\naccepting this hypothesis. No doubt some of the old species\r\noccasionally died out, and left no representatives in Europe or\r\nelsewhere; others were locally exterminated in the struggle for life by\r\nspecies which invaded their ancient domain, or by varieties better\r\nfitted for a new state of things. Pauses also of vast duration may have\r\noccurred in the deposition of strata, allowing time for the\r\nmodification of organic life throughout the globe, slowly brought about\r\nby variation accompanied by extinction of the original forms.\r\n\r\nFig. 361: Plagiostoma (Lima) giganteum. Fig. 362: Gryphæa incurva.\r\n\r\nFossils of the Lias.—The name of Gryphite limestone has sometimes been\r\napplied to the Lias, in consequence of the great number of shells which\r\nit contains of a species of oyster, or _ Gryphæa_ (Fig. 362). A large\r\nheavy shell called _Hippopodium_ (Fig. 365), allied to _Cypricardia,_\r\nis also characteristic of the upper part of the Lower Lias. In this\r\nformation occur also the Aviculas, Figs. 363 and 364. The Lias\r\nformation is also remarkable for being the newest of the secondary\r\nrocks in which brachiopoda of the genera _Spirifer_ and _ Leptæna_\r\n(Figs. 366, 367) occur, although the former is slightly modified in\r\nstructure so as to constitute the subgenus Spiriferina, Davidson, and\r\nthe Leptæna has dwindled to a shell smaller in size than a pea. No less\r\nthan eight or nine species of Spiriferina are enumerated by Mr.\r\nDavidson as belonging to the Lias. Palliobranchiate mollusca\r\npredominate greatly in strata older than the Trias; but, so far as we\r\nyet know, they did not survive the Liassic epoch.\r\n\r\nFig. 363: Avicula inæquivalvis.

Fig. 370:\r\nNautilus truncatus. Fig. 371: Ammonites bifrons.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made, p. 354, to numerous zones in the Lias\r\nhaving each their peculiar Ammonites. Two of these occur near the base\r\nof the Lower Lias, having a united thickness, varying from 40 to 80\r\nfeet. The upper of these is characterised by _Ammonites Bucklandi,_ and\r\nthe lower by _Ammonites planorbis_ (see Figs. 368, 369).[1] Sometimes,\r\nhowever, there is a third intermediate zone, that of _Ammonites\r\nangulatus,_ which is the equivalent of the zone called the infra-lias\r\non the Continent, the species of which are for the most part common to\r\nthe superior group marked by _Ammonites Bucklandi._\r\n\r\nFig. 372: Ammonites margaritatus.\r\nAmong the Crinoids or Stone-lilies of the Lias, the Pentacrinites are\r\nconspicuous. (See Fig. 373.) Of _ Palæocoma (Ophioderma) Egertoni_\r\n(Fig. 374), referable to the _Ophiuridæ_ of Muller, perfect specimens\r\nhave been met with in the Middle Lias beds of Dorset and Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nFig. 373: Extracrinus (Pentacrinus) Briareus. Fig. 374: Palæocoma\r\n(Ophioderma) tenuibrachiata.\r\n\r\nThe _Extracrinus Briareus_ (removed by Major Austin from Pentacrinus on\r\naccount of generic differences) occurs in tangled masses, forming thin\r\nbeds of considerable extent, in the Lower Lias of Dorset,\r\nGloucestershire, and Yorkshire. The remains are often highly charged\r\nwith pyrites. This Crinoid, with its innumerable tentacular arms,\r\nappears to have been frequently attached to the driftwood of the\r\nliassic sea, in the same manner as Barnacles float about on wood at the\r\npresent day. There is another species of _ Extracrinus_ and several of\r\n_Pentacrinus_ in the Lias; and the latter genus is found in nearly all\r\nthe formations from the Lias to the London Clay inclusive. It is\r\nrepresented in the present seas by the delicate and rare _Pentacrinus\r\ncaput-medusæ_ of the Antilles, which, with Comatula, is one of the few\r\nsurviving members of the ancient family of the Crinoids, represented by\r\nso many extinct genera in the older formations.\r\n\r\nFig. 375: Scales of Lepidotus gigas. Fig. 376: a. Scales of Æchmodus\r\nLeachii, b. Æchmodus (restored outline), c. Scales of Dapedius\r\nmonilifer.\r\n\r\nFishes of the Lias.—The fossil fish, of which there are no less than\r\n117 species known as British, resemble generically those of the Oolite,\r\nbut differ, according to M. Agassiz, from those of the Cretaceous\r\nperiod. Among them is a species of _ Lepidotus_ (_L. gigas,_ Agassiz),\r\nFig. 375, which is found in the Lias of England, France, and\r\nGermany.[2] This genus was before mentioned (p. 316) as occurring in\r\nthe Wealden, and is supposed to have frequented both rivers and\r\nsea-coasts. Another genus of Ganoids (or fish with hard, shining, and\r\nenamelled scales), called _Æchmodus_ (Fig. 376), is almost exclusively\r\nLiassic. The teeth of a species of _ Acrodus,_ also, are very abundant\r\nin the Lias (Fig. 377).\r\n\r\nFig. 377: Acrodus nobilis. Fig. 378: Hybodus reticulatus, a. Part of\r\nfin, commonly called Ichthyodorylite, b. Tooth.\r\n\r\nBut the remains of fish which have excited more attention than any\r\nothers are those large bony spines called ichthyodorulites (a, Figure\r\n378), which were once supposed by some naturalists to be jaws, and by\r\nothers weapons, resembling those of the living Balistes and Silurus;\r\nbut which M. Agassiz has shown to be neither the one nor the other. The\r\nspines, in the genera last mentioned, articulate with the backbone,\r\nwhereas there are no signs of any such articulation in the\r\nichthyodorulites.\r\n\r\nFig. 379: Chimæra monstrosa. Fig. 379: Chimæra monstrosa.[3]\r\n\r\nThese last appear to have been bony spines which formed the anterior\r\npart of the dorsal fin, like that of the living genera _ Cestracion_\r\nand _Chimæra_ (see _a,_ Figure 379). In both of these genera, the\r\nposterior concave face is armed with small spines, as in that of the\r\nfossil _Hybodus_ (Fig. 378), a placoid fish of the shark family found\r\nfossil at Lyme Regis. Such spines are simply imbedded in the flesh, and\r\nattached to strong muscles. “They serve,” says Dr. Buckland, “as in the\r\n_Chimæra_ (Fig. 379), to raise and depress the fin, their action\r\nresembling that of a movable mast, raising and lowering backward the\r\nsail of a barge.”[4]\r\n\r\nReptiles of the Lias.—It is not, however, the fossil fish which form\r\nthe most striking feature in the organic remains of the Lias; but the\r\n_Enaliosaurian_ reptiles, which are extraordinary for their number,\r\nsize, and structure. Among the most singular of these are several\r\nspecies of _Ichthyosaurus_ and _Plesiosaurus_ (Figs. 380, 381). The\r\ngenus _ Ichthyosaurus,_ or fish-lizard, is not confined to this\r\nformation, but has been found in strata as high as the White Chalk of\r\nEngland, and as low as the Trias of Germany, a formation which\r\nimmediately succeeds the Lias in the descending order. It is evident\r\nfrom their fish-like vertebræ, their paddles, resembling those of a\r\nporpoise or whale, the length of their tail, and other parts of their\r\nstructure, that the Ichthyosaurs were aquatic. Their jaws and teeth\r\nshow that they were carnivorous; and the half-digested remains of\r\nfishes and reptiles, found within their skeletons, indicate the precise\r\nnature of their food.\r\n\r\nMr. Conybeare was enabled, in 1824, after examining many skeletons\r\nnearly perfect, to give an ideal restoration of the osteology of this\r\ngenus, and of that of the _ Plesiosaurus._[5] (See Figs. 380, 381.) The\r\nlatter animal had an extremely long neck and small head, with teeth\r\nlike those of the crocodile, and paddles analogous to those of the _\r\nIchthyosaurus,_ but larger. It is supposed to have lived in shallow\r\nseas and estuaries, and to have breathed air like the Ichthyosaur and\r\nour modern cetacea.[6] Some of the reptiles above mentioned were of\r\nformidable dimensions. One specimen of _ Ichthyosaurus platydon,_ from\r\nthe Lias at Lyme, now in the British Museum, must have belonged to an\r\nanimal more than 24 feet in length; and there are species of\r\n_Plesiosaurus_ which measure from 18 to 20 feet in length. The form of\r\nthe _ Ichthyosaurus_ may have fitted it to cut through the waves like\r\nthe porpoise; as it was furnished besides its paddles with a tail-fin\r\nso constructed as to be a powerful organ of motion; but it is supposed\r\nthat the _Plesiosaurus,_ at least the long-necked species (Fig. 381),\r\nwas better suited to fish in shallow creeks and bays defended from\r\nheavy breakers.\r\n\r\nIt is now very generally agreed that these extinct saurians must have\r\ninhabited the sea; and it was urged that as there are now chelonians,\r\nlike the tortoise, living in fresh water, and others, as the turtle,\r\nfrequenting the ocean, so there may have been formerly some saurians\r\nproper to salt, others to fresh water. The common crocodile of the\r\nGanges is well-known to frequent equally that river and the brackish\r\nand salt water near its mouth; and crocodiles are said in like manner\r\nto be abundant both in the rivers of the Isla de Pinos (Isle of Pines),\r\nsouth of Cuba, and in the open sea round the coast. In 1835 a curious\r\nlizard (_Amblyrhynchus cristatus_) was discovered by Mr. Darwin in the\r\nGalapagos Islands.[7] It was found to be exclusively marine, swimming\r\neasily by means of its flattened tail, and subsisting chiefly on\r\nseaweed. One of them was sunk from the ship by a heavy weight, and on\r\nbeing drawn up after an hour was quite unharmed.\r\n\r\nFig. 380: Skeleton of Ichthyosaurus communis, restored by Conybeare and\r\nCuvier. Fig. 381: Skeleton of Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus, restored by\r\nRev. W. D. Conybeare.\r\n\r\nThe families of Dinosauria, crocodiles, and Pterosauria or winged\r\nreptiles, are also represented in the Lias.\r\n\r\nSudden Destruction of Saurians.—It has been remarked, and truly, that\r\nmany of the fish and saurians, found fossil in the Lias, must have met\r\nwith sudden death and immediate burial; and that the destructive\r\noperation, whatever may have been its nature, was often repeated.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” says Dr. Buckland, “scarcely a single bone or scale has\r\nbeen removed from the place it occupied during life; which could not\r\nhave happened had the uncovered bodies of these saurians been left,\r\neven for a few hours, exposed to putrefaction, and to the attacks of\r\nfishes and other smaller animals at the bottom of the sea.”[8] Not only\r\nare the skeletons of the Ichthyosaurs entire, but sometimes the\r\ncontents of their stomachs still remain between their ribs, as before\r\nremarked, so that we can discover the particular species of fish on\r\nwhich they lived, and the form of their excrements. Not unfrequently\r\nthere are layers of these coprolites, at different depths in the Lias,\r\nat a distance from any entire skeletons of the marine lizards from\r\nwhich they were derived; “as if,” says Sir H. De la Beche, “the muddy\r\nbottom of the sea received small sudden accessions of matter from time\r\nto time, covering up the coprolites and other exuviæ which had\r\naccumulated during the intervals.”[9] It is further stated that, at\r\nLyme Regis, those surfaces only of the coprolites which lay uppermost\r\nat the bottom of the sea have suffered partial decay, from the action\r\nof water before they were covered and protected by the muddy sediment\r\nthat has afterwards permanently enveloped them.\r\n\r\nNumerous specimens of the Calamary or pen-and-ink fish, (_Geoteuthis\r\nbollensis_) have also been met with in the Lias at Lyme, with the\r\nink-bags still distended, containing the ink in a dried state, chiefly\r\ncomposed of carbon, and but slightly impregnated with carbonate of\r\nlime. These Cephalopoda, therefore, must, like the saurians, have been\r\nsoon buried in sediment; for, if long exposed after death, the membrane\r\ncontaining the ink would have decayed.[10]\r\n\r\nAs we know that river-fish are sometimes stifled, even in their own\r\nelement, by muddy water during floods, it cannot be doubted that the\r\nperiodical discharge of large bodies of turbid fresh water in the sea\r\nmay be still more fatal to marine tribes. In the “Principles of\r\nGeology” I have shown that large quantities of mud and drowned animals\r\nhave been swept down into the sea by rivers during earthquakes, as in\r\nJava in 1699; and that indescribable multitudes of dead fishes have\r\nbeen seen floating on the sea after a discharge of noxious vapours\r\nduring similar convulsions. But in the intervals between such\r\ncatastrophes, strata may have accumulated slowly in the sea of the\r\nLias, some being formed chiefly of one description of shell, such as\r\nammonites, others of gryphites.\r\n\r\nFig. 382: Wing of a neuropterous insect.\r\n\r\nFresh-water Deposits.—Insect-beds.—From the above remarks the reader\r\nwill infer that the Lias is for the most part a marine deposit. Some\r\nmembers, however, of the series have an estuarine character, and must\r\nhave been formed within the influence of rivers. At the base of the\r\nUpper and Lower Lias respectively, insect-beds appear to be almost\r\neverywhere present throughout the Midland and South-western districts\r\nof England. These beds are crowded with the remains of insects, small\r\nfish, and crustaceans, with occasional marine shells. One band in\r\nGloucestershire, rarely exceeding a foot in thickness, has been named\r\nthe “insect limestone.” It passes upward, says the Reverend P. B.\r\nBrodie,[11] into a shale containing _Cypris_ and _ Estheria,_ and is\r\nfull of the wing-cases of several genera of Coleoptera, with some\r\nnearly entire beetles, of which the eyes are preserved. The nervures of\r\nthe wings of neuropterous insects (Figure 382) are beautifully perfect\r\nin this bed. Ferns, with Cycads and leaves of monocotyledonous plants,\r\nand some apparently brackish and fresh-water shells, accompany the\r\ninsects in several places, while in others marine shells predominate,\r\nthe fossils varying apparently as we examine the bed nearer or farther\r\nfrom the ancient land, or the source whence the fresh water was\r\nderived. After studying 300 specimens of these insects from the Lias,\r\nMr. Westwood declares that they comprise both wood-eating and\r\nherb-devouring beetles, of the Linnean genera _Elater, Carabus,_ etc.,\r\nbesides grasshoppers (_Gryllus_), and detached wings of dragon-flies\r\nand may-flies, or insects referable to the Linnean genera _Libellula,\r\nEphemera, Hemerobius,_ and _Panorpa,_ in all belonging to no less than\r\ntwenty-four families. The size of the species is usually small, and\r\nsuch as taken alone would imply a temperate climate; but many of the\r\nassociated organic remains of other classes must lead to a different\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nFossil Plants.—Among the vegetable remains of the Lias, several species\r\nof _Zamia_ have been found at Lyme Regis, and the remains of coniferous\r\nplants at Whitby. M. Ad. Brongniart enumerates forty-seven liassic\r\nacrogens, most of them ferns; and fifty gymnosperms, of which\r\nthirty-nine are cycads, and eleven conifers. Among the cycads the\r\npredominance of _ Zamites,_ and among the ferns the numerous genera\r\nwith leaves having reticulated veins (as in Fig. 349), are mentioned as\r\nbotanical characteristics of this era.[12] The absence as yet from the\r\nLias and Oolite of all signs of dicotyledonous angiosperms is worthy of\r\nnotice. The leaves of such plants are frequent in tertiary strata, and\r\noccur in the Cretaceous, though less plentifully (see p. 303). The\r\nangiosperms seem, therefore, to have been at the least comparatively\r\nrare in these older secondary periods, when more space was occupied by\r\nthe Cycads and Conifers.\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Oolite and Lias.—The entire group of Oolite and Lias\r\nconsists of repeated alternations of clay, sandstone, and limestone,\r\nfollowing each other in the same order. Thus the clays of the Lias are\r\nfollowed by the sands now considered (see p. 353) as belonging to the\r\nsame formation, though formerly referred to the Inferior Oolite, and\r\nthese sands again by the shelly and coralline limestone called the\r\nGreat or Bath Oolite. So, in the Middle Oolite, the Oxford Clay is\r\nfollowed by calcareous grit and coral rag; lastly, in the Upper Oolite,\r\nthe Kimmeridge Clay is followed by the Portland Sand and limestone (see\r\nFig. 298).[13] The clay beds, however, as Sir H. de la Beche remarks,\r\ncan be followed over larger areas than the sand or sandstones.[14] It\r\nshould also be remembered that while the Oolite system becomes\r\narenaceous and resembles a coal-field in Yorkshire, it assumes in the\r\nAlps an almost purely calcareous form, the sands and clays being\r\nomitted; and even in the intervening tracts it is more complicated and\r\nvariable than appears in ordinary descriptions. Nevertheless, some of\r\nthe clays and intervening limestones do retain, in reality, a pretty\r\nuniform character for distances of from 400 to 600 miles from east to\r\nwest and north to south.\r\n\r\nIn order to account for such a succession of events, we may imagine,\r\nfirst, the bed of the ocean to be the receptacle for ages of fine\r\nargillaceous sediment, brought by oceanic currents, which may have\r\ncommunicated with rivers, or with part of the sea near a wasting coast.\r\nThis mud ceases, at length, to be conveyed to the same region, either\r\nbecause the land which had previously suffered denudation is depressed\r\nand submerged, or because the current is deflected in another direction\r\nby the altered shape of the bed of the ocean and neighbouring dry land.\r\nBy such changes the water becomes once more clear and fit for the\r\ngrowth of stony zoophytes. Calcareous sand is then formed from\r\ncomminuted shell and coral, or, in some cases, arenaceous matter\r\nreplaces the clay; because it commonly happens that the finer sediment,\r\nbeing first drifted farthest from coasts, is subsequently overspread by\r\ncoarse sand, after the sea has grown shallower, or when the land,\r\nincreasing in extent, whether by upheaval or by sediment filling up\r\nparts of the sea, has approached nearer to the spots first occupied by\r\nfine mud.\r\n\r\nThe increased thickness of the limestones in those regions, as in the\r\nAlps and Jura, where the clays are comparatively thin, arises from the\r\ncalcareous matter having been derived from species of corals and other\r\norganic beings which live in clear water, far from land, to the growth\r\nof which the influx of mud would be unfavourable. Portions therefore of\r\nthese clays and limestones have probably been formed contemporaneously\r\nto a greater extent than we can generally prove, for the distinctness\r\nof the species of organic beings would be caused by the difference of\r\nconditions between the more littoral and the more pelagic areas and the\r\ndifferent depths and nature of the sea-bottom. Independently of those\r\nascending and descending movements which have given rise to the\r\nsuperposition of the limestones and clays, and by which the position of\r\nland and sea are made in the course of ages to vary, the geologist has\r\nthe difficult task of allowing for the contemporaneous thinning out in\r\none direction and thickening in another, of the successive organic and\r\ninorganic deposits of the same era.\r\n\r\n [1] Quart.

These white beds were called by William\r\nSmith the White Lias, and they have been shown by Mr. Charles Moore to\r\nbelong to a formation similar to one in the Rhætian Alps of Bavaria, to\r\nwhich Mr. Gumbel has applied the name of Rhætic. They have also long\r\nbeen known as the Koessen beds in Germany, and may be regarded as beds\r\nof passage between the Lias and Trias. They are named the Penarth beds\r\nby the Government surveyors of Great Britain, from Penarth, near\r\nCardiff, in Glamorganshire, where they sometimes attain a thickness of\r\nfifty feet.\r\n\r\nThe principal member of this group has been called by Dr. Wright the\r\n_Avicula contorta_ bed,[1] as this shell is very abundant, and has a\r\nwide range in Europe. General Portlock first described the formation as\r\nit occurs at Portrush, in Antrim, where the _ Avicula contorta_ is\r\naccompanied by _Pecten Valoniensis,_ as in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe best known member of the group, a thin band or bone-breccia, is\r\nconspicuous among the black shales in the neighbourhood of Axmouth in\r\nDevonshire, and in the cliffs of Westbury-on-Severn, as well as at Aust\r\nand other places on the borders of the Bristol Channel. It abounds in\r\nthe remains of saurians and fish, and was formerly classed as the\r\nlowest bed of the Lias; but Sir P. Egerton first pointed out, in 1841,\r\nthat it should be referred to the Upper New Red Sandstone, because it\r\ncontained an assemblage of fossil fish which are either peculiar to\r\nthis stratum, or belong to species well-known in the Muschelkalk of\r\nGermany. These fish belong to the genera _Acrodus, Hybodus, Gyrolepis,_\r\nand _Saurichthys._\r\n\r\nFig. 383: Cardium rhæticum. Fig. 384: Pecten Valoniensis. Fig. 385:\r\nAvicula contorta. Fig. 386: Hybodus plica ilis. Fig. 387: Saurichthys\r\napicalis. Fig. 388: Gyrolepsis tenuistriatus.\r\n\r\nAmong those common to the English bone-bed and the Muschelkalk of\r\nGermany are _Hybodus plicatilis_ (Fig. 386), _Saurychthys apicalis_\r\n(Fig. 387), _Gyrolepis tenuistriatus_ (Fig. 388), and _G. Albertii._\r\nRemains of saurians, _Plesiosaurus_ among others, have also been found\r\nin the bone-bed, and plates of an _Encrinus._ It may be questioned\r\nwhether some of those fossils which have the most Triassic character\r\nmay not have been derived from the destruction of older strata, since\r\nin bone-beds, in general, many of the organic remains are undoubtedly\r\nderivative.\r\n\r\nFig. 389: Microlestes antiquus, molar tooth.\r\n_Triassic Mammifer._—In North-western Germany, as in England, there\r\noccurs beneath the Lias a remarkable bone breccia. It is filled with\r\nshells and with the remains of fishes and reptiles, almost all the\r\ngenera of which, and some even of the species, agree with those of the\r\nsubjacent Trias. This breccia has accordingly been considered by\r\nProfessor Quenstedt, and other German geologists of high authority, as\r\nthe newest or uppermost part of the Trias. Professor Plieninger found\r\nin it, in 1847, the molar tooth of a small Triassic mammifer, called by\r\nhim _ Microlestes antiquus._ He inferred its true nature from its\r\ndouble fangs, and from the form and number of the protuberances or\r\ncusps on the flat crown; and considering it as predaceous, probably\r\ninsectivorous, he called it _Microlestes_ from micros, little, and\r\nlestes, a beast of prey. Soon afterwards he found a second tooth, also\r\nat the same locality, Diegerloch, about two miles to the south-east of\r\nStuttgart.\r\n\r\nNo anatomist had been able to give any feasible conjecture as to the\r\naffinities of this minute quadruped until Dr. Falconer, in 1857,\r\nrecognised an unmistakable resemblance between its teeth and the two\r\nback molars of his new genus _Plagiaulax_ (Fig. 306), from the Purbeck\r\nstrata. This would lead us to the conclusion that Microlestes was\r\nmarsupial and plant-eating.\r\n\r\nIn Würtemberg there are two bone-beds, namely, that containing the\r\nMicrolestes, which has just been described, which constitutes, as we\r\nhave seen, the uppermost member of the Trias, and another of still\r\ngreater extent, and still more rich in the remains of fish and\r\nreptiles, which is of older date, intervening between the Keuper and\r\nMuschelkalk.\r\n\r\nThe genera _Saurichthys, Hybodus,_ and _Gyrolepis_ are found in both\r\nthese breccias, and one of the species, _ Saurichthys Mongeoti,_ is\r\ncommon to both bone-beds, as is also a remarkable reptile called\r\n_Nothosaurus mirabilis._ The saurian called _Belodon_ by H. von Meyer,\r\nof the Thecodont family, is another Triassic form, associated at\r\nDiegerloch with Microlestes.\r\n\r\nTRIAS OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nBetween the Lias and the Coal (or Carboniferous group) there is\r\ninterposed, in the midland and western counties of England, a great\r\nseries of red loams, shales, and sandstones, to which the name of the\r\n“New Red Sandstone formation” was first given, to distinguish it from\r\nother shales and sandstones called the “Old Red,” often identical in\r\nmineral character, which lie immediately beneath the coal. The name of\r\n“Red Marl” has been incorrectly applied to the red clays of this\r\nformation, as before explained (p. 38), for they are remarkably free\r\nfrom calcareous matter. The absence, indeed, of carbonate of lime, as\r\nwell as the scarcity of organic remains, together with the bright red\r\ncolour of most of the rocks of this group, causes a strong contrast\r\nbetween it and the Jurassic formations before described.\r\n\r\nThe group in question is more fully developed in Germany than in\r\nEngland or France. It has been called the Trias by German writers, or\r\nthe Triple Group, because it is separable into three distinct\r\nformations, called the “Keuper,” the “Muschelkalk,” and the\r\n“Bunter-sandstein.” Of these the middle division, or the Muschelkalk,\r\nis wholly wanting in England, and the uppermost (Keuper) and lowest\r\n(Bunter) members of the series are not rich in fossils.\r\n\r\nUpper Trias or Keuper.—In certain grey indurated marls below the\r\nbone-bed Mr. Boyd Dawkins has found at Watchet, on the coast of\r\nSomersetshire, a molar tooth of Microlestes, enabling him to refer to\r\nthe Trias strata formerly supposed to be Liassic. Mr. Charles Moore had\r\npreviously discovered many teeth of mammalia of the same family near\r\nFrome, in Somersetshire, in the contents of a vertical fissure\r\ntraversing a mass of carboniferous limestone. The top of this fissure\r\nmust have communicated with the bed of the Triassic sea, and probably\r\nat a point not far from the ancient shore on which the small marsupials\r\nof that era abounded.\r\n\r\nThis upper division of the Trias called the Keuper is of great\r\nthickness in the central counties of England, attaining, according to\r\nMr. Hull’s estimate, no less than 3450 feet in Cheshire, and it covers\r\na large extent of country between Lancashire and Devonshire.\r\n\r\nIn Worcestershire and Warwickshire in sandstone belonging to the\r\nuppermost part of the Keuper the bivalve crustacean _Estheria minuta_\r\noccurs. The member of the English “New Red” containing this shell, in\r\nthose parts of England, is, according to Sir Roderick Murchison and Mr.\r\nStrickland, 600 feet thick, and consists chiefly of red marl or slate,\r\nwith a band of sandstone. Ichthyodorulites, or spines of _ Hybodus,_\r\nteeth of fishes, and footprints of reptiles were observed by the same\r\ngeologists in these strata.\r\n\r\nFig. 390: Estheria minuta.\r\nFig. 391: Hyperodapedon Gordoni. Left Plate, Maxillary.\r\nIn the Upper Trias or Keuper the remains of two saurians of the order\r\nLacertilia have been found. The one called _ Rhynchosaurus_ occurred at\r\nGrinsell near Shrewsbury, and is characterised by having a small\r\nbird-like skull and jaws without teeth. The other _Hyperodapedon_ (Fig.\r\n391) was first noticed in 1858, near Elgin, in strata now recognised as\r\nUpper Triassic, and afterwards in beds of about the same age in the\r\nneighbourhood of Warwick. Remains of the same genus have been found\r\nboth in Central India and Southern Africa in rocks believed to be of\r\nTriassic age. The Hyperodapedon has been shown by Professor Huxley to\r\nbe a terrestrial reptile having numerous palatal teeth, and closely\r\nallied to the living Sphenodon of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe recent discoveries of a living saurian in New Zealand so closely\r\nallied to this supposed extinct division of the Lacertilia seems to\r\nafford an illustration of a principle pointed out by Mr. Darwin of the\r\nsurvival in insulated tracts, after many changes in physical geography,\r\nof orders of which the congeners have become extinct on continents\r\nwhere they have been exposed to the severer competition of a larger\r\nprogressive fauna.\r\n\r\nFig. 392: Tooth of Labyrinthodon.\r\nTeeth of Labyrinthodon (Fig. 392) found in the Keuper in Warwickshire\r\nwere examined microscopically by Professor Owen, and compared with\r\nother teeth from the German Keuper. He found after careful\r\ninvestigation that neither of them could be referred to true saurians,\r\nalthough they had been named _Mastodonsaurus_ and _Phytosaurus_ by\r\nJäger. It appeared that they were of the _Batrachian_ order, and of\r\ngigantic dimensions in comparison with any representatives of that\r\norder now living. Both the Continental and English fossil teeth\r\nexhibited a most complicated texture, differing from that previously\r\nobserved in any reptile, whether recent or extinct, but most nearly\r\nanalogous to the _Ichthyosaurus._ A section of one of these teeth\r\nexhibits a series of irregular folds, resembling the labyrinthic\r\nwindings of the surface of the brain; and from this character Professor\r\nOwen has proposed the name Labyrinthodon for the new genus. Fig. 393 of\r\npart of one is given from his “Odontography,” plate 64, A. The entire\r\nlength of this tooth is supposed to have been about three inches and a\r\nhalf, and the breadth at the base one inch and a half.\r\n\r\nFig. 393: Transverse section of upper part of tooth of Labyrinthodon\r\nJaegeri.\r\n\r\n_Rock-salt._—In Cheshire and Lancashire there are red clays containing\r\ngypsum and salt of the age of the Trias which are between 1000 and 1500\r\nfeet thick. In some places lenticular masses of pure rock-salt nearly\r\n100 feet thick are interpolated between the argillaceous beds. At the\r\nbase of the formation beneath the rock-salt occur the Lower Sandstones\r\nand Marl, called provincially in Cheshire “water-stones,” which are\r\nlargely quarried for building. They are often ripple-marked, and are\r\nimpressed with numerous footprints of reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe basement beds of the Keuper rest with a slight unconformability\r\nupon an eroded surface of the “Bunter” next to be described.\r\n\r\nFig. 394: Single footstep of Cheirotherium.\r\n\r\nLower Trias or Bunter.—The lower division or English representative of\r\nthe “Bunter” attains a thickness of 1500 feet in the counties last\r\nmentioned, according to Professor Ramsay. Besides red and green shales\r\nand red sandstones, it comprises much soft white quartzose sandstone,\r\nin which the trunks of silicified trees have been met with at Allesley\r\nHill, near Coventry. Several of them were a foot and a half in\r\ndiameter, and some yards in length, decidedly of coniferous wood, and\r\nshowing rings of annual growth.[2] Impressions, also, of the footsteps\r\nof animals have been detected in Lancashire and Cheshire in this\r\nformation. Some of the most remarkable occur a few miles from\r\nLiverpool, in the whitish quartzose sandstone of Storton Hill, on the\r\nwest side of the Mersey. They bear a close resemblance to tracks first\r\nobserved in this member of the Upper New Red Sandstone, at the village\r\nof Hesseberg, near Hildburghausen, in Saxony. For many years these\r\nfootprints have been referred to a large unknown quadruped,\r\nprovisionally named _Cheirotherium_ by Professor Kaup, because the\r\nmarks both of the fore and hind feet resembled impressions made by a\r\nhuman hand. (See Fig. 394.) The foot-marks at Hesseberg are partly\r\nconcave, and partly in relief, the former, or the depressions, are seen\r\nupon the upper surface of the sandstone slabs, but those in relief are\r\nonly upon the lower surfaces, being, in fact, natural casts, formed in\r\nthe subjacent footprints as in moulds. The larger impressions, which\r\nseem to be those of the hind foot, are generally eight inches in\r\nlength, and five in width, and one was twelve inches long. Near each\r\nlarge footstep, and at a regular distance (about an inch and a half)\r\nbefore it, a smaller print of a fore foot, four inches long and three\r\ninches wide, occurs. The footsteps follow each other in pairs, each\r\npair in the same line, at intervals of fourteen inches from pair to\r\npair. The large as well as the small steps show the great toes\r\nalternately on the right and left side; each step makes the print of\r\nfive toes, the first, or great toe, being bent inward like a thumb.\r\nThough the fore and hind foot differ so much in size, they are nearly\r\nsimilar in form.\r\n\r\nFig. 395: Line of footsteps on slab of sandstone.\r\n\r\nAs neither in Germany nor in England had any bones or teeth been met\r\nwith in the same identical strata as the footsteps, anatomists\r\nindulged, for several years, in various conjectures respecting the\r\nmysterious animals from which they might have been derived. Professor\r\nKaup suggested that the unknown quadruped might have been allied to the\r\n_Marsupialia_; for in the kangaroo the first toe of the fore foot is in\r\na similar manner set obliquely to the others, like a thumb, and the\r\ndisproportion between the fore and hind feet is also very great. But M.\r\nLink conceived that some of the four species of animals of which the\r\ntracks had been found in Saxony might have been gigantic _Batrachians,_\r\nand when it was afterwards inferred that the Labyrinthodon was an\r\nair-breathing reptile, it was conjectured by Professor Owen that it\r\nmight be one and the same as the Cheirotherium.\r\n\r\nDolomitic Conglomerate of Bristol.—Near Bristol, in Somersetshire, and\r\nin other counties bordering the Severn, the lowest strata belonging to\r\nthe Triassic series consist of a conglomerate or breccia resting\r\nunconformably upon the Old Red Sandstone, and on different members of\r\nthe Carboniferous rocks, such as the Coal Measures, Millstone Grit, and\r\nMountain Limestone. This mode of superposition will be understood by\r\nreference to the section below Dundry Hill (Fig. 85), where No. 4 is\r\nthe dolomitic conglomerate. Such breccias may have been partly the\r\nresult of the subÆrial waste of an old land-surface which gradually\r\nsank down and suffered littoral denudation in proportion as it became\r\nsubmerged. The pebbles and fragments of older rocks which constitute\r\nthe conglomerate are cemented together by a red or yellow base of\r\ndolomite, and in some places the encrinites and other fossils derived\r\nfrom the Mountain Limestone are so detached from the parent rocks that\r\nthey have the deceptive appearance of belonging to a fauna\r\ncontemporaneous with the dolomitic beds in which they occur. The\r\nimbedded fragments are both rounded and angular, some consisting of\r\nsandstone from the coal-measures, being of vast size, and weighing\r\nnearly a ton. Fractured bones and teeth of saurians which are truly of\r\ncontemporaneous origin are dispersed through some parts of the breccia,\r\nand two of these reptiles called Thecodont saurians, named from the\r\nmanner in which the teeth were implanted in the jawbone, obtained great\r\ncelebrity because the patches of red conglomerate in which they were\r\nfound, near Bristol, were originally supposed to be of Permian or\r\nPalæozoic age, and therefore the only representatives in England of\r\nvertebrate animals of so high a grade in rocks of such antiquity. The\r\nteeth of these saurians are conical, compressed, and with finely\r\nserrated edges (see Fig. 396); they are referred by Professor Huxley to\r\nthe Dinosaurian order.\r\n\r\nFig. 396: Tooth of Thecodontosaurus.\r\nOrigin of Red Sandstone and Rock-salt.—In various parts of the world,\r\nred and mottled clays and sandstones, of several distinct geological\r\nepochs, are found associated with salt, gypsum, and magnesian\r\nlimestone, or with one or all of these substances. There is, therefore,\r\nin all likelihood, a general cause for such a coincidence.\r\nNevertheless, we must not forget that there are dense masses of red and\r\nvariegated sandstones and clays, thousands of feet in thickness, and of\r\nvast horizontal extent, wholly devoid of saliferous or gypseous matter.\r\nThere are also deposits of gypsum and of common salt, as in the\r\nblue-clay formation of Sicily, without any accompanying red sandstone\r\nor red clay.\r\n\r\nThese red deposits may be accounted for by the decomposition of gneiss\r\nand mica schist, which in the eastern Grampians of Scotland has\r\nproduced a mass of detritus of precisely the same colour as the Old Red\r\nSandstone.\r\n\r\nIt is a general fact, and one not yet accounted for, that scarcely any\r\nfossil remains are ever preserved in stratified rocks in which this\r\noxide of iron abounds; and when we find fossils in the New or Old Red\r\nSandstone in England, it is in the grey, and usually calcareous beds,\r\nthat they occur. The saline or gypseous interstratified beds may have\r\nbeen produced by submarine gaseous emanations, or hot mineral springs,\r\nwhich often continue to flow in the same spots for ages. Beds of\r\nrock-salt are, however, more generally attributed to the evaporation of\r\nlakes or lagoons communicating at intervals with the ocean. In Cheshire\r\ntwo beds of salt occur of the extraordinary thickness of 90 or even 100\r\nfeet, and extending over an area supposed to be 150 miles in diameter.\r\nThe adjacent beds present ripple-marked sandstones and footprints of\r\nanimals at so many levels as to imply that the whole area underwent a\r\nslow and gradual depression during the formation of the red sandstone.\r\n\r\nMajor Harris, in his “Highlands of Ethiopia,” describes a salt lake,\r\ncalled the Bahr Assal, near the Abyssinian frontier, which once formed\r\nthe prolongation of the Gulf of Tadjara, but was afterwards cut off\r\nfrom the gulf by a broad bar of lava or of land upraised by an\r\nearthquake. “Fed by no rivers, and exposed in a burning climate to the\r\nunmitigated rays of the sun, it has shrunk into an elliptical basin,\r\nseven miles in its transverse axis, half filled with smooth water of\r\nthe deepest cærulean hue, and half with a solid sheet of glittering\r\nsnow-white salt, the offspring of evaporation.” “If,” says Mr. Hugh\r\nMiller, “we suppose, instead of a barrier of lava, that sand-bars were\r\nraised by the surf on a flat arenaceous coast during a slow and equable\r\nsinking of the surface, the waters of the outer gulf might occasionally\r\ntopple over the bar, and supply fresh brine when the first stock had\r\nbeen exhausted by evaporation.”\r\n\r\nThe Runn of Cutch, as I have shown elsewhere,[3] is a low region near\r\nthe delta of the Indus, equal in extent to about a quarter of Ireland,\r\nwhich is neither land nor sea, being dry during part of every year, and\r\ncovered by salt water during the monsoons. Here and there its surface\r\nis incrusted over with a layer of salt caused by the evaporation of\r\nsea-water. A subsiding movement has been witnessed in this country\r\nduring earthquakes, so that a great thickness of pure salt might result\r\nfrom a continuation of such sinking.\r\n\r\nTRIAS OF GERMANY.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, as before hinted, chapter 21, the Trias first received its\r\nname as a Triple Group, consisting of two sandstones with an\r\nintermediate marine calcareous formation, which last is wanting in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE OF TRIAS.\r\n\r\nGerman French English Keuper Marnes irisées Saliferous and\r\ngypseous\r\nshales and sandstone. Muschelkalk Muschelkalk, on calcaire\r\ncoquillier Wanting in England. Bunter-sandstein Grès\r\nbigarré Sandtone and quartzose conglomerate.\r\n\r\nKeuper.—The first of these, or the Keuper, underlying the beds before\r\ndescribed as Rhætic, attains in Würtemberg a thickness of about 1000\r\nfeet. It is divided by Alberti into sandstone, gypsum, and carbonaceous\r\nclay-slate.[4] Remains of reptiles called _Nothosaurus_ and\r\n_Phytosaurus,_ have been found in it with Labyrinthodon; the detached\r\nteeth, also, of placoid fish and of Rays, and of the genera\r\n_Saurichthys_ and _Gyrolepis_ (Figs. 387, 388). The plants of the\r\nKeuper are generically very analogous to those of the oolite and lias,\r\nconsisting of ferns, equisetaceous plants, cycads, and conifers, with a\r\nfew doubtful monocotyledons. A few species such as _Equisetites\r\ncolumnaris,_ are common to this group and the oolite.\r\n\r\nFig. 397: Equisetites columnaris.\r\n_St. Cassian and Hallstadt Beds_ (see Map, Fig. 398).— The sandstones\r\nand clay of the Keuper resemble the deposits of estuaries and a shallow\r\nsea near the land, and afford, in the N.W. of Germany, as in France and\r\nEngland, but a scanty representation of the marine life of that period.\r\nWe might, however, have anticipated, from its rich reptilian fauna,\r\nthat the contemporaneous inhabitants of the sea of the Keuper period\r\nwould be very numerous, should we ever have an opportunity of bringing\r\ntheir remains to light. This, it is believed, has at length been\r\naccomplished, by the position now assigned to certain Alpine rocks\r\ncalled the “St. Cassian beds,” the true place of which in the series\r\nwas until lately a subject of much doubt and discussion. It has been\r\nproved that the Hallstadt beds on the northern flanks of the Austrian\r\nAlps correspond in age with the St. Cassian beds on their southern\r\ndeclivity, and the Austrian geologists, M. Suess of Vienna and others,\r\nhave satisfied themselves that the Hallstadt formation is referable to\r\nthe period of the Upper Trias. Assuming this conclusion to be correct,\r\nwe become acquainted suddenly and unexpectedly with a rich marine fauna\r\nbelonging to a period previously believed to be very barren of organic\r\nremains, because in England, France, and Northern Germany the upper\r\nTrias is chiefly represented by beds of fresh or brackish water origin.\r\n\r\nFig. 398: Map of Tyrol and Styria showing St. Cassian and Hallstadt\r\nBeds.\r\n\r\nFig. 399: Scoliotoma. Fig. 400: Koninckia Leonhardi.\r\nAbout 600 species of invertebrate fossils occur in the Hallstadt and\r\nSt. Cassian beds, many of which are still undescribed; some of the\r\nMollusca are of new and peculiar genera, as _Scoliostoma,_ Fig. 399,\r\nand _Platystoma,_ Fig. 400, among the Gasteropoda; and _Koninckia,_\r\nFig. 401, among the Brachiopoda.\r\n\r\nFig. 401: Koninckia Leonhardi.\r\nThe following table of genera of marine shells from the Hallstadt and\r\nSt. Cassian beds, drawn up first on the joint authority of M. Suess and\r\nthe late Dr. Woodward, and since corrected by Messrs. Etheridge and\r\nTate, shows how many connecting links between the fauna of primary and\r\nsecondary Palæozoic and Mesozoic rocks are supplied by the St. Cassian\r\nand Hallstadt beds.\r\n\r\nGENERA OF FOSSIL MOLLUSCA IN THE ST. CASSIAN AND HALLSTADT BEDS.\r\n\r\nCommon to Older Rocks Characteristic Triassic Genera Common to\r\nNewer Rocks Orthoceras\r\nBactrites\r\nMacrocheilus\r\nLoxonema\r\nHolopella\r\nMurchisonia\r\nPorcellia\r\nAthyris\r\nRetzia\r\nCyrtina\r\nEuomphalus  Ceratites\r\nCochloceras\r\nChoristoceras\r\nRhabdoceras\r\nAulacoceras\r\nScoliostoma [5]\r\nNaticella\r\nPlatystoma\r\nPtychostoma\r\nEuchrysalis\r\nHalobia\r\nHornesia\r\nAmphiclina\r\nKoninckia\r\nCassianella [6]\r\nMyophoria [6]  Ammonites\r\nChemnitzia\r\nCerithium\r\nMonodonta\r\nOpis\r\nSphoera\r\nCardita\r\nMyoconcha\r\nHinnites\r\nMonotis\r\nPlicatula\r\nPachyrisma\r\nThecidium\r\n\r\nThe first column marks the last appearance of several genera which are\r\ncharacteristic of Palæozoic strata. The second shows those genera which\r\nare characteristic of the Upper Trias, either as peculiar to it, or, as\r\nin the three cases marked by asterisks, reaching their maximum of\r\ndevelopment at this era. The third column marks the first appearance in\r\nTriassic rocks of genera destined to become more abundant in later\r\nages.\r\n\r\nIt is only, however, when we contemplate the number of species by which\r\neach of the above-mentioned genera are represented that we comprehend\r\nthe peculiarities of what is commonly called the St. Cassian fauna.\r\nThus, for example, the Ammonite, which is not common to older rocks, is\r\nrepresented by no less than seventy-three species; whereas Loxonema,\r\nwhich is only known as common to older rocks, furnishes fifteen\r\nTriassic species. Cerithium, so abundant in tertiary strata, and which\r\nstill lives, is represented by no less than fourteen species. As the\r\nOrthoceras had never been met with in the marine Muschelkalk, much\r\nsurprise was naturally felt that seven or eight species of the genus\r\nshould appear in the Hallstadt beds, assuming these last to belong to\r\nthe Upper Trias. Among these species are some of large dimensions,\r\nassociated with large Ammonites with foliated lobes, a form never seen\r\nbefore so low in the series, while the Orthoceras had never been seen\r\nso high.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the rich marine fauna of Hallstadt and St. Cassian, now\r\ngenerally assigned to the lowest members of the Upper Trias or Keuper,\r\nleads us to suspect that when the strata of the Triassic age are better\r\nknown, especially those belonging to the period of the Bunter\r\nsandstone, the break between the Palæozoic and Mesozoic Periods may be\r\nalmost effaced. Indeed some geologists are not yet satisfied that the\r\ntrue position of the St. Cassian beds (containing so great an admixture\r\nof types, having at once both Mesozoic and Palæozoic affinities) is\r\nmade out, and doubt whether they have yet been clearly proved to be\r\nnewer than the Muschelkalk.\r\n\r\nMuschelkalk.—The next member of the Trias in Germany, the\r\n_Muschelkalk,_ which underlies the _Keuper_ before described, consists\r\nchiefly of a compact greyish limestone, but includes beds of dolomite\r\nin many places, together with gypsum and rock-salt. This limestone, a\r\nformation wholly unrepresented in England, abounds in fossil shells, as\r\nthe name implies. Among the Cephalopoda there are no belemnites, and no\r\nammonites with foliated sutures, as in the Lias, and Oolite, and the\r\nHallstadt beds; but we find instead a genus allied to the Ammonite,\r\ncalled _Ceratites_ by de Haan, in which the descending lobes (Fig. 402)\r\nterminate in a few small denticulations pointing inward. Among the\r\nbivalve crustacea, the _Estheria minuta,_ Bronn (see Fig. 390), is\r\nabundant, ranging through the Keuper, Muschelkalk, and\r\nBunter-sandstein; and _Gervillia socialis_ (Fig. 403), having a similar\r\nrange, is found in great numbers in the Muschelkalk of Germany, France,\r\nand Poland.\r\n\r\nFig. 402: Ceratites nodosus. Fig. 403: Gervillia (Avicula) socialis.\r\nFig. 404: Enerinus liliiformis. Fig. 405: Aspidura loricata.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of the heads and stems of lily encrinites, _ Encrinus\r\nliliiformis_ (Fig. 404), (or _Encrinites moniliformis_), shows the slow\r\nmanner in which some beds of this limestone have been formed in clear\r\nsea-water. The star-fish called _Aspidura loricata_ (Fig. 405) is as\r\nyet peculiar to the Muschelkalk. In the same formation are found the\r\nskull and teeth of a reptile of the genus _Placodus_ (see Fig. 406),\r\nwhich was referred originally by Munster, and afterwards by Agassiz, to\r\nthe class of fishes. But more perfect specimens enabled Professor Owen,\r\nin 1858, to show that this fossil animal was a Saurian reptile, which\r\nprobably fed on shell-bearing mollusks, and used its short and flat\r\nteeth, so thickly coated with enamel, for pounding and crushing the\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nFig. 406: Palatal teeth of Placodus gigas.\r\nFig. 407: Voltzia heterophylla.\r\nBunter-sandstein.—The _Bunter-sandstein_ consists of various-coloured\r\nsandstones, dolomites, and red clays, with some beds, especially in the\r\nHartz, of calcareous pisolite or roe-stone, the whole sometimes\r\nattaining a thickness of more than 1000 feet. The sandstone of the\r\nVosges is proved, by its fossils, to belong to this lowest member of\r\nthe Triassic group. At Sulzbad (or Soultz-les-bains), near Strasburg,\r\non the flanks of the Vosges, many plants have been obtained from the\r\n“bunter,” especially conifers of the extinct genus _Voltzia,_ of which\r\nthe fructification has been preserved. (See Fig. 407.) Out of thirty\r\nspecies of ferns, cycads, conifers, and other plants, enumerated by M.\r\nAd. Brongniart, in 1849, as coming from the “Grès bigarré,” or Bunter,\r\nnot one is common to the Keuper.\r\n\r\nThe footprints of Labyrinthodon observed in the clays of this formation\r\nat Hildburghausen, in Saxony, have already been mentioned. Some idea of\r\nthe variety and importance of the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of the\r\nthree members of the Trias in Northern Germany may be derived from the\r\nfact that in the great monograph by the late Hermann von Meyer on the\r\nreptiles of the Trias, the remains of no less than eighty distinct\r\nspecies are described and figured.\r\n\r\nTRIAS OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nNew Red Sandstone of the Valley of the Connecticut River.—In a\r\ndepression of the granitic or hypogene rocks in the States of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut strata of red sandstone, shale, and\r\nconglomerate are found, occupying an area more than 150 miles in length\r\nfrom north to south, and about five to ten miles in breadth, the beds\r\ndipping to the eastward at angles varying from 5 to 50 degrees. The\r\nextreme inclination of 50 degrees is rare, and only observed in the\r\nneighbourhood of masses of trap which have been intruded into the red\r\nsandstone while it was forming, or before the newer parts of the\r\ndeposit had been completed. Having examined this series of rocks in\r\nmany places, I feel satisfied that they were formed in shallow water,\r\nand for the most part near the shore, and that some of the beds were\r\nfrom time to time raised above the level of the water, and laid dry,\r\nwhile a newer series, composed of similar sediment, was forming.\r\n\r\nFig. 408: Foot-prints of a bird, Turner’s Falls, Valley of the\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Hitchcock, the footprints of no less than\r\nthirty-two species of bipeds, and twelve of quadrupeds, have been\r\nalready detected in these rocks. Thirty of these are believed to be\r\nthose of birds, four of lizards, two of chelonians, and six of\r\nbatrachians. The tracks have been found in more than twenty places,\r\nscattered through an extent of nearly 80 miles from north to south, and\r\nthey are repeated through a succession of beds attaining at some points\r\na thickness of more than 1000 feet.[7]\r\n\r\nThe bipedal impressions are, for the most part, trifid, and show the\r\nsame number of joints as exist in the feet of living tridactylous\r\nbirds. Now, such birds have three phalangeal bones for the inner toe,\r\nfour for the middle, and five for the outer one (see Fig. 408); but the\r\nimpression of the terminal joint is that of the nail only. The fossil\r\nfootprints exhibit regularly, where the joints are seen, the same\r\nnumber; and we see in each continuous line of tracks the three-jointed\r\nand five-jointed toes placed alternately outward, first on the one\r\nside, and then on the other. In some specimens, besides impressions of\r\nthe three toes in front, the rudiment is seen of the fourth toe behind.\r\nIt is not often that the matrix has been fine enough to retain\r\nimpressions of the integument or skin of the foot; but in one fine\r\nspecimen found at Turner’s Falls, on the Connecticut, by Dr. Deane,\r\nthese markings are well preserved, and have been recognised by\r\nProfessor Owen as resembling the skin of the ostrich, and not that of\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\nThe casts of the footprints show that some of the fossil bipeds of the\r\nred sandstone of Connecticut had feet four times as large as the living\r\nostrich, but scarcely, perhaps, larger than the Dinornis of New\r\nZealand, a lost genus of feathered giants related to the Apteryx, of\r\nwhich there were many species which have left their bones and almost\r\nentire skeletons in the superficial alluvium of that island. By\r\nreferring to what was said of the Iguanodon of the Wealden, the reader\r\nwill perceive that the Dinosaur was somewhat intermediate between\r\nreptiles and birds, and left a series of tridactylous impressions on\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nTo determine the exact age of the red sandstone and shale containing\r\nthese ancient footprints, in the United States, is not possible at\r\npresent. No fossil shells have yet been found in the deposit, nor\r\nplants in a determinable state. The fossil fish are numerous and very\r\nperfect; but they are of a peculiar type, called _Ischypterus,_ by Sir\r\nPhilip Egerton, from the great size and strength of the fulcral rays of\r\nthe dorsal fin, from ischus, strength, and pteron, a fin.\r\n\r\nThe age of the Connecticut beds cannot be proved by direct\r\nsuperposition, but may be presumed from the general structure of the\r\ncountry. That structure proves them to be newer than the movements to\r\nwhich the Appalachian or Allegheny chain owes its flexures, and this\r\nchain includes the ancient or palæozoic coal-formation among its\r\ncontorted rocks.\r\n\r\nCoal-field of Richmond, Virginia.—In the State of Virginia, at the\r\ndistance of about 13 miles eastward of Richmond, the capital of that\r\nState, there is a coal-field occurring in a depression of the granite\r\nrocks, and occupying a geological position analogous to that of the New\r\nRed Sandstone, above-mentioned, of the Connecticut valley. It extends\r\n26 miles from north to south, and from four to twelve from east to\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe plants consist chiefly of zamites, calamites, equiseta, and ferns,\r\nand, upon the whole, are considered by Professor Heer to have the\r\nnearest affinity to those of the European Keuper.\r\n\r\nThe equiseta are very commonly met with in a vertical position more or\r\nless compressed perpendicularly. It is clear that they grew in the\r\nplaces where they are now buried in strata of hardened sand and mud. I\r\nfound them maintaining their erect attitude, at points many miles\r\napart, in beds both above and between the seams of coal. In order to\r\nexplain this fact, we must suppose such shales and sandstones to have\r\nbeen gradually accumulated during the slow and repeated subsidence of\r\nthe whole region.\r\n\r\nFig. 409: Triassic coal-shale, Richmond, Virginia.\r\nThe fossil fish are Ganoids, some of them of the genus _ Catopterus,_\r\nothers belonging to the liassic genus _ Tetragonolepis (Æchmodus),_ see\r\nFig. 376. Two species of _ Entomostraca_ called _Estheria_ are in such\r\nprofusion in some shaly beds as to divide them like the plates of mica\r\nin micaceous shales (see Fig. 409).\r\n\r\nThese Virginian coal-measures are composed of grits, sandstones, and\r\nshales, exactly resembling those of older or primary date in America\r\nand Europe, and they rival, or even surpass, the latter in the richness\r\nand thickness of the coal-seams. One of these, the main seam, is in\r\nsome places from 30 to 40 feet thick, composed of pure bituminous coal.\r\nThe coal is like the finest kinds shipped at Newcastle, and when\r\nanalysed yields the same proportions of carbon and hydrogen—a fact\r\nworthy of notice, when we consider that this fuel has been derived from\r\nan assemblage of plants very distinct specifically, and in part\r\ngenerically, from those which have contributed to the formation of the\r\nancient or palæozoic coal.\r\n\r\nTriassic Mammifer.—In North Carolina, the late Professor Emmons has\r\ndescribed the strata of the Chatham coal-field, which correspond in age\r\nto those near Richmond, in Virginia. In beds underlying them he has met\r\nwith three jaws of a small insectivorous mammal which he has called\r\n_Dromatherium sylvestre,_ closely allied to _Spalacotherium._ Its\r\nnearest living analogue, says Professor Owen, “is found in Myrmecobius;\r\nfor each ramus of the lower jaw contained ten small molars in a\r\ncontinuous series, one canine, and three conical incisors—the latter\r\nbeing divided by short intervals.”\r\n\r\nLow Grade of Early Mammals favourable to the Theory of Progressive\r\nDevelopment.—There is every reason to believe that this fossil\r\nquadruped is at least as ancient as the Microlestes of the European\r\nTrias described in p. 368; and the fact is highly important, as proving\r\nthat a certain low grade of marsupials had not only a wide range in\r\ntime, from the Trias to the Purbeck, or uppermost oolitic strata of\r\nEurope, but had also a wide range in space, namely, from Europe to\r\nNorth America, in an east and west direction, and, in regard to\r\nlatitude, from Stonesfield, in 52° N., to that of North Carolina, 35°\r\nN.\r\n\r\nIf the three localities in Europe where the most ancient mammalia have\r\nbeen found—Purbeck, Stonesfield, and Stuttgart—had belonged all of them\r\nto formations of the same age, we might well have imagined so limited\r\nan area to have been peopled exclusively with pouched quadrupeds, just\r\nas Australia now is, while other parts of the globe were inhabited by\r\nplacentals; for Australia now supports one hundred and sixty species of\r\nmarsupials, while the rest of the continents and islands are tenanted\r\nby about seventeen hundred species of mammalia, of which only forty-six\r\nare marsupial, namely, the opossums of North and South America. But the\r\ngreat difference of age of the strata in each of these three localities\r\nseems to indicate the predominance throughout a vast lapse of time\r\n(from the era of the Upper Trias to that of the Purbeck beds) of a low\r\ngrade of quadrupeds; and this persistency of similar generic and\r\nordinal types in Europe while the species were changing, and while the\r\nfish, reptiles, and mollusca were undergoing great modifications, would\r\nnaturally lead us to suspect that there must also have been a vast\r\nextension in space of the same marsupial forms during that portion of\r\nthe Secondary or Mesozoic epoch which has been termed “the age of\r\nreptiles.” Such an inference as to the wide geographical range of the\r\nancient marsupials has been confirmed by the discovery in the Trias of\r\nNorth America of the above-mentioned Dromatherium. The predominance in\r\nearlier ages of these mammalia of a low grade, and the absence, so far\r\nas our investigations have yet gone, of species of higher organisation,\r\nwhether aquatic or terrestrial, is certainly in favour of the theory of\r\nprogressive development.\r\n\r\n [1] Dr. Wright, on Lias and Bone Bed, Quart.

As this\r\npoint has been selected as a line of demarkation for one of the three\r\ngreat divisions of the fossiliferous series, the student might\r\nnaturally expect that by aid of lithological and palæontological\r\ncharacters he would be able to recognise without difficulty a distinct\r\nbreak between the newer and older group. But so far is this from being\r\nthe case in Great Britain, that nowhere have geologists found more\r\ndifficulty in drawing the line of separation than between the Secondary\r\nand Primary series. The obscurity has arisen from the great resemblance\r\nin colour and mineral character of the Triassic and Permian red marls\r\nand sandstones, and the scarcity and often total absence in them of\r\norganic remains. The thickness of the strata belonging to each group\r\namounts in some places to several thousand feet; and by dint of a\r\ncareful examination of their geological position, and of those fossil,\r\nanimal, and vegetable forms which are occasionally met with in some\r\nmembers of each series, it has at length been made clear that the older\r\nor Permian rocks are more connected with the Primary or Palæozoic than\r\nwith the Secondary or Mesozoic strata already described.\r\n\r\nThe term Permian has been proposed for this group by Sir R. Murchison,\r\nfrom Perm, a Russian province, where it occupies an area twice the size\r\nof France, and contains a great abundance and variety of fossils, both\r\nvertebrate and invertebrate. Professor Sedgwick in 1832[1] described\r\nwhat is now recognised as the central member of this group, the\r\nMagnesian limestone, showing that it attained a thickness of 600 feet\r\nalong the north-east of England, in the counties of Durham, Yorkshire,\r\nand Nottinghamshire, its lower part often passing into a fossiliferous\r\nmarl-slate and resting on an inferior Red Sandstone, the equivalent of\r\nthe Rothliegendes of Germany. It has since been shown that some of the\r\nRed Sandstones of newer date also belong to the Permian group; and it\r\nappears from the observations of Mr. Binney, Sir R. Murchison, Mr.\r\nHarkness, and others, that it is in the region where the limestone is\r\nmost largely developed, as, for example, in the county of Durham, that\r\nthe associated red sandstones or sedimentary rocks are thinnest,\r\nwhereas in the country where the latter are thickest the calcareous\r\nmember is reduced to thirty, or even sometimes to ten feet. It is\r\nclear, therefore, says Mr. Hull, that the sedimentary region in the\r\nnorth of England area has been to the westward, and the calcareous area\r\nto the eastward; and that in this group there has been a development\r\nfrom opposite directions of the two types of strata.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this he has given us the following table:\r\n\r\nTHICKNESS OF PERMIAN STRATA IN NORTH OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n  N.W. of England N.E. of England Feet Feet Upper Permian\r\n  (Sedimentary) 600 50–100 Middle Permian\r\n  (Calcareous) 10–30 600 Lower Permian\r\n  (Sedimentary) 3000 100–250[2]\r\n\r\nUpper Permian.—What is called in this table the Upper Permian will be\r\nseen to attain its chief thickness in the north-west, or on the coast\r\nof Cumberland, as at St. Bee’s Head, where it is described by Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison as consisting of massive red sandstones with gypsum\r\nresting on a thin course of Magnesian Limestone with fossils, which\r\nagain is connected with the Lower Red Sandstone, resembling the upper\r\none in such a manner that the whole forms a continuous series. No\r\nfossil footprints have been found in this Upper as in the Lower Red\r\nSandstone.\r\n\r\nMiddle Permian—Magnesian Limestone and Marl-slate.—This formation is\r\nseen upon the coast of Durham and Yorkshire, between the Wear and the\r\nTees. Among its characteristic fossils are _Schizodus Schlotheimi_\r\n(Fig. 410) and _Mytilus septifer_ (Fig. 412). These shells occur at\r\nHartlepool and Sunderland, where the rock assumes an oolitic and\r\nbotryoidal character. Some of the beds in this division are\r\nripple-marked. In some parts of the coast of Durham, where the rock is\r\nnot crystalline, it contains as much as 44 per cent of carbonate of\r\nmagnesia, mixed with carbonate of lime. In other places—for it is\r\nextremely variable in structure—it consists chiefly of carbonate of\r\nlime, and has concreted into globular and hemispherical masses, varying\r\nfrom the size of a marble to that of a cannon-ball, and radiating from\r\nthe centre. Occasionally earthy and pulverulent beds pass into compact\r\nlimestone or hard granular dolomite. Sometimes the limestone appears in\r\na brecciated form, the fragments which are united together not\r\nconsisting of foreign rocks but seemingly composed of the breaking-up\r\nof the Permian limestone itself, about the time of its consolidation.\r\nSome of the angular masses in Tynemouth cliff are two feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nFig. 410: Schidozus Schlotheimi, Permian crystalline limestone. Fig.\r\n411: The hinge of Schizodus truncatus, Permian. Fig. 412: Mytilus\r\nseptifer, Permian crystalline limestone.\r\n\r\nThe magnesian limestone sometimes becomes very fossiliferous and\r\nincludes in it delicate bryozoa, one of which, _Fenestella retiformis_\r\n(Fig. 413), is a very variable species, and has received many different\r\nnames. It sometimes attains a large size, single specimens measuring\r\neight inches in width. The same bryozoan, with several other British\r\nspecies, is also found abundantly in the Permian of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe total known fauna of the Permian series of Great Britain at present\r\nnumbers 147 species, of which 77, or more than half, are mollusca. Not\r\none of these is common to rocks newer than the Palæozoic, and the\r\nbrachiopods are the only group which have furnished species common to\r\nthe more ancient or Carboniferous rocks. Of these _Lingula Crednerii_\r\n(Fig. 415) is an example. There are 25 Gasteropods and only one\r\ncephalopod, _Nautilus Freieslebeni,_ which is also found in the German\r\nZechstein.\r\n\r\nFig. 413: Magnesian Limestone. Fig. 413: Magnesian Limestone, Humbleton\r\nHill, near Sunderland.[3]\r\n\r\nShells of the genera _Productus_ (Fig. 414) and _ Strophalosia_ (the\r\nlatter of allied form with hinge teeth), which do not occur in strata\r\nnewer than the Permian, are abundant in the ordinary yellow magnesian\r\nlimestone, as will be seen in the valuable memoirs of Messrs. King and\r\nHowse. They are accompanied by certain species of _Spirifera_ (Fig.\r\n416), _Lingula Crednerii_ (Fig. 415), and other brachiopoda of the true\r\nprimary or palæozoic type. Some of this same tribe of shells, such as\r\nCamarophoria, allied to Rhynchonella, Spiriferina, and two species of\r\n_Lingula,_ are specifically the same as fossils of the carboniferous\r\nrocks. _Avicula, Arca,_ and _Schizodus_ (Fig. 410), and other\r\nlamellibranchiate bivalves, are abundant, but spiral univalves are very\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nFig. 414: Productus horridus. Fig. 415: Lingula Crednerii. Fig. 416:\r\nSpirifera alata.\r\n\r\nBeneath the limestone lies a formation termed the marl-stone, which\r\nconsists of hard calcareous shales, marl-slate, and thin-bedded\r\nlimestones. At East Thickley, in Durham, where it is thirty feet thick,\r\nthis slate has yielded many fine specimens of fossil fish—of the genera\r\n_Palæoniscus_ ten species, _Pygopterus_ two species, _Coelacanthus_ two\r\nspecies, and _Platysomus_ two species, which as genera are common to\r\nthe older Carboniferous formation, but the Permian species are\r\npeculiar, and, for the most part, identical with those found in the\r\nmarl-slate or copper-slate of Thuringia.\r\n\r\nFig. 417: Restored outline of a fish of the genus Palæoniscus. Fig.\r\n418: Shark, Heterocercal. Fig. 419: Shad. (Clupea. Herring tribe.)\r\nHomocereal.\r\n\r\nThe _Palæoniscus_ above mentioned belongs to that division of fishes\r\nwhich M. Agassiz has called “Heterocercal,” which have their tails\r\nunequally bilobate, like the recent shark and sturgeon, and the\r\nvertebral column running along the upper caudal lobe. (See Fig. 418.)\r\nThe “Homocercal” fish, which comprise almost all the 9000 species at\r\npresent known in the living creation, have the tail-fin either single\r\nor equally divided; and the vertebral column stops short, and is not\r\nprolonged into either lobe. (See Fig. 419.) Now it is a singular fact,\r\nfirst pointed out by Agassiz, that the heterocercal form, which is\r\nconfined to a small number of genera in the existing creation, is\r\nuniversal in the magnesian limestone, and all the more ancient\r\nformations. It characterises the earlier periods of the earth’s\r\nhistory, whereas in the secondary strata, or those newer than the\r\nPermian, the homocercal tail predominates.\r\n\r\nA full description has been given by Sir Philip Egerton of the species\r\nof fish characteristic of the marl-slate, in Professor King’s monograph\r\nbefore referred to, where figures of the ichthyolites, which are very\r\nentire and well preserved, will be found. Even a single scale is\r\nusually so characteristically marked as to indicate the genus, and\r\nsometimes even the particular species. They are often scattered through\r\nthe beds singly, and may be useful to a geologist in determining the\r\nage of the rock.\r\n\r\nFig. 420: Palæoniscus comptus. Fig. 421: Palæoniscus elegans.

Hancock and Howse for the discovery in this\r\nmarl-slate at Midderidge, Durham, of two species of _ Protosaurus,_ a\r\ngenus of reptiles, one representative of which, _P. Speneri,_ has been\r\ncelebrated ever since the year 1810 as characteristic of the\r\nKupfer-schiefer or Permian of Thuringia. Professor Huxley informs us\r\nthat the agreement of the Durham fossil with Hermann von Meyer’s figure\r\nof the German specimen is most striking. Although the head is wanting\r\nin all the examples yet found, they clearly belong to the Lacertian\r\norder, and are therefore of a higher grade than any other vertebrate\r\nanimal hitherto found fossil in a Palæozoic rock. Remains of\r\nLabyrinthodont reptiles have also been met with in the same slate near\r\nDurham.\r\n\r\nLower Permian.—The inferior sandstones which lie beneath the marl-slate\r\nconsist of sandstone and sand, separating the Magnesian Limestone from\r\nthe coal, in Yorkshire and Durham. In some instances, red marl and\r\ngypsum have been found associated with these beds. They have been\r\nclassed with the Magnesian Limestone by Professor Sedgwick, as being\r\nnearly co-extensive with it in geographical range, though their\r\nrelations are very obscure. But the principal development of Lower\r\nPermian is, as we have seen by Mr. Hull’s table p. 386, in the\r\nnorthwest, where the Penrith sandstone, as it has been called, and the\r\nassociated breccias and purple shales are estimated by Professor\r\nHarkness to attain a thickness of 3000 feet. Organic remains are\r\ngenerally wanting, but the leaves and wood of coniferous plants, and in\r\none case a cone, have been found. Also in the purple marls of\r\nCorncockle Muir near Dumfries, very distinct footprints of reptiles\r\noccur, originally referred to the Trias, but shown by Mr. Binney in\r\n1856 to be Permian. No bones of the animals which they represent have\r\nyet been discovered.\r\n\r\n_Angular Breccias in Lower Permian._—A striking feature in these beds\r\nis the occasional occurrence, especially at the base of the formation,\r\nof angular and sometimes rounded fragments of Carboniferous and older\r\nrocks of the adjoining districts being included in a paste of red marl.\r\nSome of the angular masses are of huge size.\r\n\r\nIn the central and southern counties, where the Middle Permian or\r\nMagnesian Limestone is wanting, it is difficult to separate the upper\r\nand lower sandstones, and Mr. Hull is of opinion that the patches of\r\nthis formation found here and there in Worcestershire, Shropshire, and\r\nother counties may have been deposited in a sea separated from the\r\nnorthern basin by a barrier of Carboniferous rocks running east and\r\nwest, and now concealed under the Triassic strata of Cheshire. Similar\r\nbreccias to those before described are found in the more southern\r\ncounties last mentioned, where their appearance is rendered more\r\nstriking by the marked contrast they present to the beds of well-rolled\r\nand rounded pebbles of the Trias occupying a large area in the same\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay refers the angular form and large size of the\r\nfragments composing these breccias to the action of floating ice in the\r\nsea. These masses of angular rock, some of them weighing more than half\r\na ton, and lying confusedly in a red, unstratified marl, like stones in\r\nboulder-drift, are in some cases polished, striated, and furrowed like\r\nerratic blocks in the moraine of a glacier. They can be shown in some\r\ncases to have travelled from the parent rocks, thirty or more miles\r\ndistant, and yet not to have lost their angular shape.[4]\r\n\r\nPermian Rocks of the Continent.—Germany is the classic ground of the\r\nMagnesian Limestone now called Permian. The formation was well studied\r\nby the miners of that country a century ago as containing a thin band\r\nof dark-coloured cupriferous shale, characterised at Mansfield in\r\nThuringia by numerous fossil fish. Beneath some variegated sandstones\r\n(not belonging to the Trias, though often confounded with it) they came\r\ndown first upon a dolomitic limestone corresponding to the upper part\r\nof our Middle Permian, and then upon a marl-slate richly impregnated\r\nwith copper pyrites, and containing fish and reptiles (Protosaurus)\r\nidentical in species with those of the corresponding marl-slate of\r\nDurham. To the limestone they gave the name of Zechstein, and to the\r\nmarl-slate that of Mergel-schiefer or Kupfer-schiefer. Beneath the\r\nfossiliferous group lies the Rothliegendes or Rothtodt-liegendes,\r\nmeaning the red-lyer or red-dead-lyer, so-called by the German miners\r\nfrom its colour, and because the copper had _died out_ when they\r\nreached this underlying non-metalliferous member of the series. This\r\nred under-lyer is, in fact, a great deposit of red sandstone, breccia,\r\nand conglomerate with associated porphyry, basalt, and amygdaloid.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir R. Murchison, the Permian rocks are composed, in\r\nRussia, of white limestone, with gypsum and white salt; and of red and\r\ngreen grits, occasionally with copper ore; also magnesian limestones,\r\nmarl-stones, and conglomerates.\r\n\r\nFig. 426: Walchia piniformis.\r\n\r\nPermian Flora.—About 18 or 20 species of plants are known in the\r\nPermian rocks of England. None of them pass down into the Carboniferous\r\nseries, but several genera, such as _ Alethopteris, Neuropteris,\r\nWalchia,_ and _Ullmania,_ are common to the two groups. The Permian\r\nflora on the Continent appears, from the researches of MM. Murchison\r\nand de Verneuil in Russia, and of MM. Geinitz and von Gutbier in\r\nSaxony, to be, with a few exceptions, distinct from that of the coal.\r\n\r\nFig. 27: Cardiocarpon Ottonis.\r\n\r\nIn the Permian rocks of Saxony no less than 60 species of fossil plants\r\nhave been met with. Two or three of these, as _Calamites gigas,\r\nSphenopteris erosa,_ and _S. lobata,_ are also met with in the\r\ngovernment of Perm in Russia. Seven others, and among them _Neuropteris\r\nLoshii, Pecopteris arborescens,_ and _P. similis,_ and several species\r\nof _Walchia_ (see Fig. 426), a genus of Conifers, called _Lycopodites_\r\nby some authors, are said by Geinitz to be common to the coal-measures.\r\n\r\nFig. 428: Noeggerathia cuneifolia. Fig. 428: Noeggerathia cuneifolia.\r\nBrongniart.[5]\r\n\r\nAmong the genera also enumerated by Colonel Gutbier are the fruit\r\ncalled _Cardiocarpon_ (see Fig. 427), _ Asterophyllites,_ and\r\nAnnularia, so characteristic of the Carboniferous period; also\r\n_Lepidodendron,_ which is common to the Permian of Saxony, Thuringia,\r\nand Russia, although not abundant. _Neoggerathia_ (see Fig. 428), the\r\nleaves of which have parallel veins without a midrib, and to which\r\nvarious generic synonyms, such as _Cordaites, Flabellaria,_ and _\r\nPoacites,_ have been given, is another link between the Permian and\r\nCarboniferous vegetation. Coniferæ, of the Araucarian division, also\r\noccur; but these are likewise met with both in older and newer rocks.\r\nThe plants called _Sigillaria_ and _ Stigmaria,_ so marked a feature in\r\nthe Carboniferous period, are as yet wanting in the true Permian.\r\n\r\nAmong the remarkable fossils of the Rothliegendes, or lowest part of\r\nthe Permian in Saxony and Bohemia, are the silicified trunks of\r\ntree-ferns called generically _Psaronius._ Their bark was surrounded by\r\na dense mass of air-roots, which often constituted a great addition to\r\nthe original stem, so as to double or quadruple its diameter. The same\r\nremark holds good in regard to certain living extra-tropical\r\narborescent ferns, particularly those of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, it is evident that the Permian plants approach much\r\nnearer to the Carboniferous flora than to the Triassic; and the same\r\nmay be said of the Permian fauna.\r\n\r\n [1] Trans.

The coal itself, even in Great Britain and Belgium, where\r\nit is most abundant, constitutes but an insignificant portion of the\r\nwhole mass. In South Wales, for example, the thickness of the\r\ncoal-bearing strata has been estimated at between 11,000 and 12,000\r\nfeet, while the various coal seams, about 80 in number, do not,\r\naccording to Professor Phillips, exceed in the aggregate 120 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous formation assumes various characters in different\r\nparts even of the British Islands. It usually comprises two very\r\ndistinct members: first, the sedimentary beds, usually called the\r\nCoal-measures, of mixed fresh-water, terrestrial, and marine origin,\r\noften including seams of coal; second, that named in England the\r\nMountain or Carboniferous Limestone, of purely marine origin, and made\r\nup chiefly of corals, shells, and encrinites, and resting on shales\r\ncalled the shales of the Mountain Limestone.\r\n\r\nIn the south-western part of our island, in Somersetshire and South\r\nWales, the three divisions usually spoken of are:\r\n\r\nCoal-measures: Strata of shale, sandstone, and grit, from 600 to 12,000\r\nfeet thick, with occasional seams of coal.\r\n\r\nMillstone grit: A coarse quartzose sandstone passing into a\r\nconglomerate, sometimes used for millstones, with beds of shale;\r\nusually devoid of coal; occasionally above 600 feet thick.\r\n\r\nMountain or Carboniferous Limestone: A calcareous rock containing\r\nmarine shells, corals, and encrinites; devoid of coal; thickness\r\nvariable, sometimes more than 1500 feet.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will refer to the section in Fig. 85, he will see that\r\nthe Upper and Lower Coal-measures of the coal-field near Bristol are\r\ndivided by a micaceous flaggy sandstone called the Pennant Rock. The\r\nLower Coal-measures of the same section rest sometimes, especially in\r\nthe north part of the basin, on a base of coarse grit called the\r\nMillstone Grit (No. 2 on the previous page).\r\n\r\nIn the South Welsh coal-field Millstone Grit occurs in like manner at\r\nthe base of the productive coal. It is called by the miners the\r\n“Farewell Rock,” as when they reach it they have no longer any hopes of\r\nobtaining coal at a greater depth in the same district. In the central\r\nand northern coal-fields of England this same grit, including quartz\r\npebbles, with some accompanying sandstones and shales containing coal\r\nplants, acquires a thickness of several thousand feet, lying beneath\r\nthe productive coal-measures, which are nearly 10,000 feet thick.\r\n\r\nBelow the Millstone Grit is a continuation of similar sandstones and\r\nshales called by Professor Phillips the Yoredale series, from Yoredale,\r\nin Yorkshire, where they attain a thickness of from 800 to 1000 feet.\r\nAt several intervals bands of limestone divide this part of the series,\r\none of which, called the Main Limestone or Upper Scar Limestone,\r\ncomposed in great part of encrinites, is 70 feet thick. Thin seams of\r\ncoal also occur in these lower Yoredale beds in Yorkshire, showing that\r\nin the same region there were great alternations in the state of the\r\nsurface. For at successive periods in the same area there prevailed\r\nfirst terrestrial conditions favourable to the growth of pure coal,\r\nsecondly, a sea of some depth suited to the formation of Carboniferous\r\nLimestone, and, thirdly, a supply of muddy sediment and sand,\r\nfurnishing the materials for sandstone and shale. There is no clear\r\nline of demarkation between the Coal-measures and the Millstone Grit,\r\nnor between the Millstone Grit and underlying Yoredale rocks.\r\n\r\nOn comparing a series of vertical sections in a north-westerly\r\ndirection from Leicestershire and Warwickshire into North Lancashire,\r\nwe find, says Mr. Hull, within a distance of 120 miles an augmentation\r\nof the sedimentary materials to the extent of 16,000 feet.\r\n\r\nLeicestershire and Warwickshire 2,600 feet North\r\nStaffordshire 9,000 feet South Lancashire 12,130 feet North\r\nLancashire 18,700 feet\r\n\r\nIn central England, where the sedimentary beds are reduced to about\r\n3000 feet in all, the Carboniferous Limestone attains an enormous\r\nthickness, as much as 4000 feet at Ashbourne, near Derby, according to\r\nMr. Hull’s estimate. To a certain extent, therefore, we may consider\r\nthe calcareous member of the formation as having originated\r\nsimultaneously with the accumulation of the materials of grit,\r\nsandstone, and shale, with seams of coal; just as strata of mud, sand,\r\nand pebbles, several thousand feet thick, with layers of vegetable\r\nmatter, are now in the process of formation in the cypress swamps and\r\ndelta of the Mississippi, while coral reefs are forming on the coast of\r\nFlorida and in the sea of the Bermuda islands. For we may safely\r\nconclude that in the ancient Carboniferous ocean those marine animals\r\nwhich were limestone builders were never freely developed in areas\r\nwhere the rivers poured in fresh water charged with sand or clay; and\r\nthe limestone could only become several thousand feet thick in parts of\r\nthe ocean which remained perfectly clear for ages.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous strata of the Scotch coal-fields, those of Lanarkshire,\r\nthe Lothians, and Fife, for example, are very insignificant in\r\nthickness when compared to those of England. They consist of a few beds\r\nintercalated between the sandstones and shales containing coal and\r\nironstone, the combined thickness of all the limestones amounting to no\r\nmore than 150 feet. The vegetation of some of these northern\r\nsedimentary beds containing coal may be older than any of the\r\ncoal-measures of central and southern England, as being coeval with the\r\nMountain Limestone of the south. In Ireland the limestone predominates\r\nover the coal-bearing sands and shales. We may infer the former\r\ncontinuity of several of the coal-fields in northern and central\r\nEngland, not only from the abrupt manner in which they are cut off at\r\ntheir outcrop, but from their remarkable correspondence in the\r\nsuccession and character of particular beds. But the limited extent to\r\nwhich these strata are exposed at the surface is not merely owing to\r\ntheir former denudation, but even in a still greater degree to their\r\nhaving been largely covered by the New Red Sandstone, as in Cheshire,\r\nand here and there by the Permian strata, as in Durham.\r\n\r\nIt has long been the opinion of the most eminent geologists that the\r\ncoal-fields of Yorkshire and Lancashire were once united, the upper\r\nCoal-measures and the overlying Millstone Grit and Yoredale rocks\r\nhaving been subsequently removed; but what is remarkable, is the\r\nancient date now assigned to this denudation, for it seems that a\r\nthickness of no less than 10,000 feet of the coal-measures had been\r\ncarried away before the deposition even of the lower Permian rocks\r\nwhich were thrown down upon the already disturbed truncated edges of\r\nthe coal-strata.[1] The carboniferous strata most productive of\r\nworkable coal have so often a basin-shaped arrangement that these\r\ntroughs have sometimes been supposed to be connected with the original\r\nconformation of the surface upon which the beds were deposited. But it\r\nis now admitted that this structure has been owing to movements of the\r\nearth’s crust of upheaval and subsidence, and that the flexure and\r\ninclination of the beds has no connection with the original\r\ngeographical configuration of the district.\r\n\r\nCOAL-MEASURES.\r\n\r\nI shall now treat more particularly of the productive coal-measures,\r\nand their mode of origin and organic remains.\r\n\r\nCoal formed on Land.—In South Wales, already alluded to, where the\r\ncoal-measures attain a thickness of 12,000 feet, the beds throughout\r\nappear to have been formed in water of moderate depth, during a slow,\r\nbut perhaps intermittent, depression of the ground, in a region to\r\nwhich rivers were bringing a never-failing supply of muddy sediment and\r\nsand. The same area was sometimes covered with vast forests, such as we\r\nsee in the deltas of great rivers in warm climates, which are liable to\r\nbe submerged beneath fresh or salt water should the ground sink\r\nvertically a few feet.\r\n\r\nIn one section near Swansea, in South Wales, where the total thickness\r\nof strata is 3246 feet, we learn from Sir H. De la Beche that there are\r\nten principal masses of sandstone. One of these is 500 feet thick, and\r\nthe whole of them make together a thickness of 2125 feet. They are\r\nseparated by masses of shale, varying in thickness from 10 to 50 feet.\r\nThe intercalated coal-beds, sixteen in number, are generally from one\r\nto five feet thick, one of them, which has two or three layers of clay\r\ninterposed, attaining nine feet. At other points in the same coal-field\r\nthe shales predominate over the sandstones. Great as is the diversity\r\nin the horizontal extent of individual coal-seams, they all present one\r\ncharacteristic feature, in having, each of them, what is called its\r\n_underclay._ These underclays, co-extensive with every layer of coal,\r\nconsist of arenaceous shale, sometimes called fire-stone, because it\r\ncan be made into bricks which stand the fire of a furnace. They vary in\r\nthickness from six inches to more than ten feet; and Sir William Logan\r\nfirst announced to the scientific world in 1841 that they were regarded\r\nby the colliers in South Wales as an essential accompaniment of each of\r\nthe eighty or more seams of coal met with in their coal-field. They are\r\nsaid to form the _floor_ on which the coal rests; and some of them have\r\na slight admixture of carbonaceous matter, while others are quite\r\nblackened by it.\r\n\r\nAll of them, as Sir William Logan pointed out, are characterised by\r\ninclosing a peculiar species of fossil vegetable called _ Stigmaria,_\r\nto the exclusion of other plants. It was also observed that, while in\r\nthe overlying shales, or “roof” of the coal, ferns and trunks of trees\r\nabound without any _ Stigmariæ,_ and are flattened and compressed,\r\nthose singular plants of the underclay most commonly retain their\r\nnatural forms, unflattened and branching freely, and sending out their\r\nslender rootlets, formerly thought to be leaves, through the mud in all\r\ndirections. Several species of _Stigmaria_ had long been known to\r\nbotanists, and described by them, before their position under each seam\r\nof coal was pointed out, and before their true nature as the roots of\r\ntrees (some having been actually found attached to the base of\r\n_Sigillaria_ stumps) was recognised. It was conjectured that they might\r\nbe aquatic, perhaps floating plants, which sometimes extended their\r\nbranches and leaves freely in fluid mud, in which they were finally\r\nenveloped.\r\n\r\nNow that all agree that these underclays are ancient soils, it follows\r\nthat in every instance where we find them they attest the terrestrial\r\nnature of the plants which formed the overlying coal, which consists of\r\nthe trunks, branches, and leaves of the same plants. The trunks have\r\ngenerally fallen prostrate in the coal, but some of them still remain\r\nat right angles to the ancient soils (see Fig. 440). Professor Goppert,\r\nafter examining the fossil vegetables of the coal-fields of Germany,\r\nhas detected, in beds of pure coal, remains of plants of every family\r\nhitherto known to occur fossil in the carboniferous rocks. Many seams,\r\nhe remarks, are rich in _Sigillariæ, Lepidodendra,_ and _Stigmariæ,_\r\nthe latter in such abundance as to appear to form the bulk of the coal.\r\nIn some places, almost all the plants were calamites, in others\r\nferns.[2]\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1837 and 1840, six fossil trees were discovered in\r\nthe coal-fields of Lancashire, where it is intersected by the Bolton\r\nrailway. They were all at right angles to the plane of the bed, which\r\ndips about 15 degrees to the south. The distance between the first and\r\nthe last was more than 100 feet, and the roots of all were imbedded in\r\na soft argillaceous shale. In the same plane with the roots is a bed of\r\ncoal, eight or ten inches thick, which has been found to extend across\r\nthe railway, or to the distance of at least ten yards. Just above the\r\ncovering of the roots, yet beneath the coal-seam, so large a quantity\r\nof the _Lepidostrobus variabilis_ was discovered inclosed in nodules of\r\nhard clay, that more than a bushel was collected from the small\r\nopenings around the base of some of the trees (see Fig. 457 of this\r\ngenus). The exterior trunk of each was marked by a coating of friable\r\ncoal, varying from one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch in\r\nthickness; but it crumbled away on removing the matrix. The dimensions\r\nof one of the trees is 15½ feet in circumference at the base, 7½ feet\r\nat the top, its height being eleven feet. All the trees have large\r\nspreading roots, solid and strong, sometimes branching, and traced to a\r\ndistance of several feet, and presumed to extend much farther.\r\n\r\nIn a colliery near Newcastle a great number of _ Sigillariæ_ occur in\r\nthe rock as if they had retained the position in which they grew. No\r\nless than thirty, some of them four or five feet in diameter, were\r\nvisible within an area of 50 yards square, the interior being\r\nsandstone, and the bark having been converted into coal. Such vertical\r\nstems are familiar to our coal-miners, under the name of coal-pipes.\r\nThey are much dreaded, for almost every year in the Bristol, Newcastle,\r\nand other coal-fields, they are the cause of fatal accidents. Each\r\ncylindrical cast of a tree, formed of solid sandstone, and increasing\r\ngradually in size towards the base, and being without branches, has its\r\nwhole weight thrown downward, and receives no support from the coating\r\nof friable coal which has replaced the bark. As soon, therefore, as the\r\ncohesion of this external layer is overcome, the heavy column falls\r\nsuddenly in a perpendicular or oblique direction from the roof of the\r\ngallery whence coal has been extracted, wounding or killing the workman\r\nwho stands below. It is strange to reflect how many thousands of these\r\ntrees fell originally in their native forests in obedience to the law\r\nof gravity; and how the few which continued to stand erect, obeying,\r\nafter myriads of ages, the same force, are cast down to immolate their\r\nhuman victims.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that if, instead of working in the dark, the miner\r\nwas accustomed to remove the upper covering of rock from each seam of\r\ncoal, and to expose to the day the soils on which ancient forests grew,\r\nthe evidence of their former growth would be obvious. Thus in South\r\nStaffordshire a seam of coal was laid bare in the year 1844, in what is\r\ncalled an open work at Parkfield colliery, near Wolverhampton. In the\r\nspace of about a quarter of an acre the stumps of no less than 73 trees\r\nwith their roots attached appeared, as shown in Fig. 429, some of them\r\nmore than eight feet in circumference. The trunks, broken off close to\r\nthe root, were lying prostrate in every direction, often crossing each\r\nother. One of them measured 15, another 30 feet in length, and others\r\nless. They were invariably flattened to the thickness of one or two\r\ninches, and converted into coal. Their roots formed part of a stratum\r\nof coal ten inches thick, which rested on a layer of clay two inches\r\nthick, below which was a second forest resting on a two-foot seam of\r\ncoal. Five feet below this, again, was a third forest with large stumps\r\nof _Lepidodendra, Calamites,_ and other trees.\r\n\r\nFig. 429: Ground plan of fossil forest, Parkfield Colliery, near\r\nWolverhampton, showing the position of 73 trees in a quarter of an ace.\r\nBlending of Coal-seams.—Both in England and North America seams of coal\r\nare occasionally observed to be parted from each other by layers of\r\nclay and sand, and, after they have been persistent for miles, to come\r\ntogether and blend in one single bed, which is then found to be equal\r\nin the aggregate to the thickness of the several seams. I was shown by\r\nMr. H. D. Rogers a remarkable example of this in Pennsylvania. In the\r\nShark Mountain, near Pottsville, in that State, there are thirteen\r\nseams of anthracite coal, some of them more than six feet thick,\r\nseparated by beds of white quartzose grit and a conglomerate of quartz\r\npebbles, often of the size of a hen’s egg. Between Pottsville and the\r\nLehigh Summit Mine, seven of these seams of coal, at first widely\r\nseparated, are, in the course of several miles, brought nearer and\r\nnearer together by the gradual thinning out of the intervening\r\ncoarse-grained strata and their accompanying shales, until at length\r\nthey successively unite and form one mass of coal between forty and\r\nfifty feet thick, very pure on the whole, though with a few thin\r\npartings of clay. This mass of coal I saw quarried in the open air at\r\nMauch Chunk, on the Bear Mountain. The origin of such a vast thickness\r\nof vegetable remains, so unmixed, on the whole, with earthy\r\ningredients, can be accounted for in no other way than by the growth,\r\nduring thousands of years, of trees and ferns in the manner of peat—a\r\ntheory which the presence of the Stigmaria _in situ_ under each of the\r\nseven layers of anthracite fully bears out. The rival hypothesis, of\r\nthe drifting of plants into a sea or estuary, leaves the\r\nnon-intermixture of sediment, or of clay, sand, and pebbles, with the\r\npure coal wholly unexplained.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Bowman was the first who gave a satisfactory explanation\r\nof the manner in which distinct coal-seams, after maintaining their\r\nindependence for miles, may at length unite, and then persist\r\nthroughout another wide area with a thickness equal to that which the\r\nseparate seams had previously maintained.\r\n\r\nFig. 430: Uniting of distinct coal-seams.\r\n\r\nLet A C (Fig. 430) be a three-foot seam of coal originally laid down as\r\na mass of vegetable matter on the level area of an extensive swamp,\r\nhaving an under-clay, _f g,_ through which the Stigmariæ or roots of\r\nthe trees penetrate as usual. One portion, B C, of this seam of coal is\r\nnow inclined; the area of the swamp having subsided as much as 25 feet\r\nat E C, and become for a time submerged under salt, fresh, or brackish\r\nwater. Some of the trees of the original forest A B C fell down, others\r\ncontinued to stand erect in the new lagoon, their stumps and part of\r\ntheir trunks becoming gradually enveloped in layers of sand and mud,\r\nwhich at length filled up the new piece of water C E.\r\n\r\nWhen this lagoon has been entirely silted up and converted into land,\r\nthe forest-covered surface A B will extend once more over the whole\r\narea A B E, and a second mass of vegetable matter, D E, forming three\r\nfeet more of coal, will accumulate. We then find in the region E C two\r\nseams of coals, each three feet thick, with their respective\r\nunder-clays, with erect buried trees based upon the surface of the\r\nlower coal, the two seams being separated by 25 feet of intervening\r\nshale and sandstone. Whereas in the region A B, where the growth of the\r\nforest has never been interrupted by submergence, there will simply be\r\none seam, two yards thick, corresponding to the united thickness of the\r\nbeds B E and B C. It may be objected that the uninterrupted growth of\r\nplants during the interval of time required for the filling up of the\r\nlagoon will have caused the vegetable matter in the region D A B to be\r\nthicker than the two distinct seams E and C, and no doubt there would\r\nactually be a slight excess representing one or more generation of\r\ntrees and plants forming the undergrowth; but this excess of vegetable\r\nmatter, when compressed into coal, would be so insignificant in\r\nthickness that the miner might still affirm that the seam D A\r\nthroughout the area D A B was equal to the two seams C and E.\r\n\r\nCause of the Purity of Coal.—The purity of the coal itself, or the\r\nabsence in it of earthy particles and sand, throughout areas of vast\r\nextent, is a fact which appears very difficult to explain when we\r\nattribute each coal-seam to a vegetation growing in swamps. It has been\r\nasked how, during river inundations capable of sweeping away the leaves\r\nof ferns and the stems and roots of _Sigillariæ_ and other trees, could\r\nthe waters fail to transport some fine mud into the swamps? One\r\ngeneration after another of tall trees grew with their roots in mud,\r\nand their leaves and prostrate trunks formed layers of vegetable\r\nmatter, which was afterwards covered with mud since turned to shale.\r\nYet the coal itself, or altered vegetable matter, remained all the\r\nwhile unsoiled by earthy particles. This enigma, however perplexing at\r\nfirst sight, may, I think, be solved by attending to what is now taking\r\nplace in deltas. The dense growth of reeds and herbage which\r\nencompasses the margins of forest-covered swamps in the valley and\r\ndelta of the Mississippi is such that the fluviatile waters, in passing\r\nthrough them, are filtered and made to clear themselves entirely before\r\nthey reach the areas in which vegetable matter may accumulate for\r\ncenturies, forming coal if the climate be favourable. There is no\r\npossibility of the least intermixture of earthy matter in such cases.\r\nThus in the large submerged tract called the “Sunk Country,” near New\r\nMadrid, forming part of the western side of the valley of the\r\nMississippi, erect trees have been standing ever since the year\r\n1811-12, killed by the great earthquake of that date; lacustrine and\r\nswamp plants have been growing there in the shallows, and several\r\nrivers have annually inundated the whole space, and yet have been\r\nunable to carry in any sediment within the outer boundaries of the\r\nmorass, so dense is the marginal belt of reeds and brush-wood. It may\r\nbe affirmed that generally, in the “cypress swamps” of the Mississippi,\r\nno sediment mingles with the vegetable matter accumulated there from\r\nthe decay of trees and semi-aquatic plants. As a singular proof of this\r\nfact, I may mention that whenever any part of a swamp in Louisiana is\r\ndried up, during an unusually hot season, and the wood set on fire,\r\npits are burnt into the ground many feet deep, or as far down as the\r\nfire can descend without meeting with water, and it is then found that\r\nscarcely any residuum or earthy matter is left. At the bottom of all\r\nthese “cypress swamps” a bed of clay is found, with roots of the tall\r\ncypress (_Taxodium distichum_), just as the under-clays of the coal are\r\nfilled with _Stigmaria._\r\n\r\nConversion of Coal into Anthracite.—It appears from the researches of\r\nLiebig and other eminent chemists, that when wood and vegetable matter\r\nare buried in the earth exposed to moisture, and partially or entirely\r\nexcluded from the air, they decompose slowly and evolve carbonic acid\r\ngas, thus parting with a portion of their original oxygen. By this\r\nmeans they become gradually converted into lignite or wood-coal, which\r\ncontains a larger proportion of hydrogen than wood does. A continuance\r\nof decomposition changes this lignite into common or bituminous coal,\r\nchiefly by the discharge of carbureted hydrogen, or the gas by which we\r\nilluminate our streets and houses. According to Bischoff, the\r\ninflammable gases which are always escaping from mineral coal, and are\r\nso often the cause of fatal accidents in mines, always contain carbonic\r\nacid, carbureted hydrogen, nitrogen, and olefiant gas. The\r\ndisengagement of all these gradually transforms ordinary or bituminous\r\ncoal into anthracite, to which the various names of glance-coal, coke,\r\nhard-coal, culm, and many others, have been given.\r\n\r\nThere is an intimate connection between the extent to which the coal\r\nhas in different regions parted with its gaseous contents, and the\r\namount of disturbance which the strata have undergone. The coincidence\r\nof these phenomena may be attributed partly to the greater facility\r\nafforded for the escape of volatile matter, when the fracturing of the\r\nrocks has produced an infinite number of cracks and crevices. The gases\r\nand water which are made to penetrate these cracks are probably\r\nrendered the more effective as metamorphic agents by increased\r\ntemperature derived from the interior. It is well known that, at the\r\npresent period, thermal waters and hot vapours burst out from the earth\r\nduring earthquakes, and these would not fail to promote the\r\ndisengagement of volatile matter from the Carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania the strata of coal are horizontal to the westward of\r\nthe Alleghany Mountains, where the late Professor H. D. Rogers pointed\r\nout that they were most bituminous; but as we travel south-eastward,\r\nwhere they no longer remain level and unbroken, the same seams become\r\nprogressively debitumenized in proportion as the rocks become more bent\r\nand distorted. At first, on the Ohio River, the proportion of hydrogen,\r\noxygen, and other volatile matters ranges from forty to fifty per cent.\r\nEastward of this line, on the Monongahela, it still approaches forty\r\nper cent, where the strata begin to experience some gentle flexures. On\r\nentering the Alleghany Mountains, where the distinct anticlinal axes\r\nbegin to show themselves, but before the dislocations are considerable,\r\nthe volatile matter is generally in the proportion of eighteen or\r\ntwenty per cent. At length, when we arrive at some insulated\r\ncoal-fields associated with the boldest flexures of the Appalachian\r\nchain, where the strata have been actually turned over, as near\r\nPottsville, we find the coal to contain only from six per cent of\r\nvolatile matter, thus becoming a genuine anthracite.\r\n\r\nClay-ironstone.—Bands and nodules of clay-ironstone are common in\r\ncoal-measures, and are formed, says Sir H. De la Beche, of carbonate of\r\niron mingled mechanically with earthy matter, like that constituting\r\nthe shales. Mr. Hunt, of the Museum of Practical Geology, instituted a\r\nseries of experiments to illustrate the production of this substance,\r\nand found that decomposing vegetable matter, such as would be\r\ndistributed through all coal strata, prevented the further oxidation of\r\nthe proto-salts of iron, and converted the peroxide into protoxide by\r\ntaking a portion of its oxygen to form carbonic acid. Such carbonic\r\nacid, meeting with the protoxide of iron in solution, would unite with\r\nit and form a carbonate of iron; and this mingling with fine mud, when\r\nthe excess of carbonic acid was removed, might form beds or nodules of\r\nargillaceous ironstone.[3]\r\n\r\nIntercalated Marine Beds in Coal.—Both in the coal-fields of Europe and\r\nAmerica the association of fresh, brackish-water, and marine strata\r\nwith coal-seams of terrestrial origin is frequently recognised. Thus,\r\nfor example, a deposit near Shrewsbury, probably formed in brackish\r\nwater, has been described by Sir R. Murchison as the youngest member of\r\nthe coal-measures of that district, at the point where they are in\r\ncontact with the overlying Permian group. It consists of shales and\r\nsandstones about 150 feet thick, with coal and traces of plants;\r\nincluding a bed of limestone varying from two to nine feet in\r\nthickness, which is cellular, and resembles some lacustrine limestones\r\nof France and Germany. It has been traced for 30 miles in a straight\r\nline, and can be recognised at still more distant points. The\r\ncharacteristic fossils are a small bivalve, having the form of a\r\n_Cyclas_ or _Cyrena,_ also a small entomostracan, _Cythere inflata_\r\n(Fig. 432), and the microscopic shell of an annelid of an extinct genus\r\ncalled _ Microconchus_ (Fig. 431), allied to _Spirorbis._ In the\r\ncoal-field of Yorkshire there are fresh-water strata, some of which\r\ncontain shells referred to the family Unionidæ; but in the midst of the\r\nseries there is one thin but very widely-spread stratum, abounding in\r\nfishes and marine shells, such as _ Goniatites Listeri_ (Fig. 433),\r\n_Orthoceras,_ and _ Aviculopecten papyraceus,_ Goldf. (Fig. 434).\r\n\r\nFig. 431: Microconchus (Spirorbis) carbonarius. Fig. 432: Cythere\r\n(Leperditia) inflata. Fig. 433: Goniatites Listeri. Fig. 434:\r\nAviculopecten papyraceus.\r\nInsects in European Coal.—Articulate animals of the genus Scorpion were\r\nfound by Count Sternberg in 1835 in the coal-measures of Bohemia, and\r\nabout the same time in those of Coalbrook Dale by Mr. Prestwich, were\r\nalso true insects, such as beetles of the family _Curculionidæ,_ a\r\nneuropterous insect of the genus _Corydalis,_ and another related to\r\nthe _Phasmidæ,_ have been found.\r\n\r\nFrom the coal of Wetting, in Westphalia, several specimens of the\r\ncockroach or _Blatta_ family, and the wing of a cricket (_Acridites_)\r\nhave been described by Germar. Professor Goldenberg published, in 1854,\r\ndescriptions of no less than twelve species of insects from the nodular\r\nclay-ironstone of Saarbrück, near Trèves.[4] Among them are several _\r\nBlattinæ,_ three species of _Neuroptera,_ one beetle of the _Scarabæus_\r\nfamily, a grasshopper or locust, _ Gryllacris_ (see Fig. 435), and\r\nseveral white ants or Termites. Professor Goldenberg showed me, in\r\n1864, the wing of a white ant, found low down in the productive\r\ncoal-measures of Saarbrück, in the interior of a flattened\r\nLepidodendron. It is much larger than that of any known living species\r\nof the same genus.\r\n\r\nFig. 435: Wing of a Grasshopper. Gryllacris lithanthraca.\r\n\r\nFig. 436: Archegosaurus minor. Fossil reptile from the coal-measures,\r\nSaarbrück.\r\nBatrachian Reptiles in Coal.—No vertebrated animals more highly\r\norganised than fish were known in rocks of higher antiquity than the\r\nPermian until the year 1844, when the _Apateon pedestris,_ Meyer, was\r\ndiscovered in the coal-measures of Munster-Appel in Rhenish Bavaria,\r\nand three years later, in 1847, Professor von Dechen found three other\r\ndistinct species of the same family of Amphibia in the Saarbruck\r\ncoal-field above alluded to. These were described by the late Professor\r\nGoldfuss under the generic name of _Archegosaurus._ The skulls, teeth,\r\nand the greater portions of the skeleton, nay, even a large part of the\r\nskin, of two of these reptiles have been faithfully preserved in the\r\ncentre of spheroidal concretions of clay-ironstone. The largest of\r\nthese, _Archegosaurus Decheni,_ must have been three feet six inches\r\nlong. Figure 436 represents the skull and neck bones of the smallest of\r\nthe three, of the natural size. They were considered by Goldfuss as\r\nsaurians, but by Herman von Meyer as most nearly allied to the\r\n_Labyrinthodon_ before mentioned (p. 371), and the remains of the\r\nextremities leave no doubt they were quadrupeds, “provided,” says Von\r\nMeyer, “with hands and feet terminating in distinct toes; but these\r\nlimbs were weak, serving only for swimming or creeping.” The same\r\nanatomist has pointed out certain points of analogy between their bones\r\nand those of the _Proteus anguinus_; and Professor Owen has observed\r\nthat they make an approach to the _Proteus_ in the shortness of their\r\nribs. Two specimens of these ancient reptiles retain a large part of\r\nthe outer skin, which consisted of long, narrow, wedge-shaped,\r\ntile-like, and horny scales, arranged in rows (see Fig. 437).\r\n\r\nFig. 437: Imbricated covering of skin of Archegosaurus medius.\r\nIn 1865, several species belonging to three different genera of the\r\nsame family of perennibranchiate Batrachians were found in the\r\ncoal-field of Kilkenny in bituminous shale at the junction of the coal\r\nwith the underlying Stigmaria-bearing clay. They were, probably,\r\ninhabitants of a marsh, and the large processes projecting from the\r\nvertebræ of their tail imply, according to Professor Huxley, great\r\npowers of swimming. They were of the Labyrinthodont family, and their\r\nassociation with the fish of the coal, of which so large a proportion\r\nare ganoids, reminds us that the living perennibranchiate amphibia of\r\nAmerica frequent the same rivers as the ganoid Lepidostei or bony\r\npikes.\r\n\r\n_Labyrinthodont footprints in coal-measures._—In 1844, the very year\r\nwhen the Apateon, before mentioned, of the coal was first met with in\r\nthe country between the Moselle and the Rhine, Dr. King published an\r\naccount of the footprints of a large reptile discovered by him in North\r\nAmerica. These occur in the coal-strata of Greensburg, in Westmoreland\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania; and I had an opportunity of examining them when\r\nin that country in 1846. The footmarks were first observed standing out\r\nin relief from the lower surface of slabs of sandstone, resting on thin\r\nlayers of fine unctuous clay. I brought away one of these masses, which\r\nis represented in Fig. 438. It displays, together with footprints, the\r\ncasts of cracks (_a, a′_) of various sizes. The origin of such cracks\r\nin clay, and casts of the same, has before been explained, and referred\r\nto the drying and shrinking of mud, and the subsequent pouring of sand\r\ninto open crevices. It will be seen that some of the cracks, as at _b,\r\nc,_ traverse the footprints, and produce distortion in them, as might\r\nhave been expected, for the mud must have been soft when the animal\r\nwalked over it and left the impressions; whereas, when it afterwards\r\ndried up and shrank, it would be too hard to receive such indentations.\r\n\r\nFig. 438: Slab of sandstone from the coal-measures of Pennsylvania,\r\nwith foot-prints of air-breathing reptile and casts of cracks.\r\n\r\nWe may assume that the reptile which left these prints on the ancient\r\nsands of the coal-measures was an air-breather, because its weight\r\nwould not have been sufficient under water to have made impressions so\r\ndeep and distinct. The same conclusion is also borne out by the casts\r\nof the cracks above described, for they show that the clay had been\r\nexposed to the air and sun, so as to have dried and shrunk.\r\n\r\nNova Scotia Coal-measures.—The sedimentary strata in which thin seams\r\nof coal occur attain a thickness, as we have seen, of 18,000 feet in\r\nthe north of England exclusive of the Mountain Limestone, and are\r\nestimated by Von Dechen at over 20,000 feet in Rhenish Prussia. But the\r\nfinest example in the world of a natural exposure in a continuous\r\nsection ten miles long, occurs in the sea-cliffs bordering a branch of\r\nthe Bay of Fundy, in Nova Scotia. These cliffs, called the “South\r\nJoggins,” which I first examined in 1842, and afterwards with Dr.\r\nDawson in 1845, have lately been admirably described by the\r\nlast-mentioned geologist[5] in detail, and his evidence is most\r\nvaluable as showing how large a portion of this dense mass was formed\r\non land, or in swamps where terrestrial vegetation flourished, or in\r\nfresh-water lagoons. His computation of the thickness of the whole\r\nseries of carboniferous strata as exceeding three miles, agrees with\r\nthe measurement made independently by Sir William Logan in his survey\r\nof this coast.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that in this vast succession of strata,\r\ncomprising some marine as well as many fresh-water and terrestrial\r\nformations, there is any repetition of the same beds. There are no\r\nfaults to mislead the geologist, and cause him to count the same beds\r\nover more than once, while some of the same plants have been traced\r\nfrom the top to the bottom of the whole series, and are distinct from\r\nthe flora of the antecedent Devonian formation of Canada. Eighty-one\r\nseams of coal, varying in thickness from an inch to about five feet,\r\nhave been discovered, and no less than seventy-one of these have been\r\nactually exposed in the sea-cliffs.\r\n\r\nIn the section (Fig. 439), which I examined in 1842, the beds from _c_\r\nto _i_ are seen all dipping the same way, their average inclination\r\nbeing at an angle of 24° S.S.W. The vertical height of the cliffs is\r\nfrom 150 to 200 feet; and between _d_ and _g_—in which space I observed\r\nseventeen trees in an upright position, or, to speak more correctly, at\r\nright angles to the planes of stratification—I counted nineteen seams\r\nof coal, varying in thickness from two inches to four feet. At low tide\r\na fine horizontal section of the same beds is exposed to view on the\r\nbeach, which at low tide extends sometimes 200 yards from the base of\r\nthe cliff. The thickness of the beds alluded to, between _d_ and _g,_\r\nis about 2500 feet, the erect trees consisting chiefly of large\r\n_Sigillariæ,_ occurring at ten distinct levels, one above the other.\r\nThe usual height of the buried trees seen by me was from six to eight\r\nfeet; but one trunk was about 25 feet high and four feet in diameter,\r\nwith a considerable bulge at the base. In no instance could I detect\r\nany trunk intersecting a layer of coal, however thin; and most of the\r\ntrees terminated downward in seams of coal. Some few only were based on\r\nclay and shale; none of them, except _ Calamites,_ on sandstone. The\r\nerect trees, therefore, appeared in general to have grown on beds of\r\nvegetable matter. In the underclays _Stigmaria_ abounds.\r\n\r\nFig. 439: Section of the cliffs of the South Joggins, near Minudie,\r\nNova Scotia.\r\n\r\nThese root-bearing beds have been found under all the coal-seams, and\r\nsuch old soils are at present the most destructible masses in the whole\r\ncliff, the sandstones and laminated shales being harder and more\r\ncapable of resisting the action of the waves and the weather.\r\nOriginally the reverse was doubtless true, for in the existing delta of\r\nthe Mississippi those clays in which the innumerable roots of the\r\ndeciduous cypress and other swamp trees ramify in all directions are\r\nseen to withstand far more effectually the undermining power of the\r\nriver, or of the sea at the base of the delta, than do beds of loose\r\nsand or layers of mud not supporting trees. It is obvious that if this\r\nsand or mud be afterwards consolidated and turned to sandstone and hard\r\nshale, it would be the least destructible.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the plants, they belonged to the same genera, and most of\r\nthem to the same species, as those met with in the distant coal-fields\r\nof Europe. Dr. Dawson has enumerated more than 150 species, two-thirds\r\nof which are European, a greater agreement than can be said to exist\r\nbetween the same Nova Scotia flora and that of the coal-fields of the\r\nUnited States. By referring to the section, Fig. 439, the position of\r\nthe four-foot coal will be perceived, and in Fig. 440 (a section made\r\nby me in 1842 of a small portion) that from _e_ to _f_ of the same\r\ncliff is exhibited, in order to show the manner of occurrence of erect\r\nfossil trees at right angles to the planes of the inclined strata.\r\n\r\nFig. 440: Erect fossil trees, Coal-measures, Nova Scotia.\r\nIn the sandstone which filled their interiors, I frequently observed\r\nfern-leaves, and sometimes fragments of _Stigmaria,_ which had\r\nevidently entered together with sediment after the trunk had decayed\r\nand become hollow, and while it was still standing under water. Thus\r\nthe tree, _a,_ Fig. 440, represented in the bed _e_ in the section,\r\nFig. 439, is a hollow trunk five feet eight inches in length,\r\ntraversing various strata, and cut off at the top by a layer of clay\r\ntwo feet thick, on which rests a seam of coal (_b,_ Fig. 440) one foot\r\nthick. On this coal again stood two large trees (_c_ and _d_), while at\r\na greater height the trees _f_ and _g_ rest upon a thin seam of coal\r\n(_e_), and above them is an underclay, supporting the four-foot coal.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the layers of matter in the inside of the tree are more\r\nnumerous than those without; but it is more common in the coal-measures\r\nof all countries to find a cylinder of pure sandstone—the cast of the\r\ninterior of a tree—intersecting a great many alternating beds of shale\r\nand sandstone, which originally enveloped the trunk as it stood erect\r\nin the water. Such a want of correspondence in the materials outside\r\nand inside, is just what we might expect if we reflect on the\r\ndifference of time at which the deposition of sediment will take place\r\nin the two cases; the imbedding of the tree having gone on for many\r\nyears before its decay had made much progress. In many places distinct\r\nproof is seen that the enveloping strata took years to accumulate, for\r\nsome of the sandstones surrounding erect sigillarian trunks support at\r\ndifferent levels roots and stems of _Calamites_; the _Calamites_ having\r\nbegun to grow after the older _Sigillariæ_ had been partially buried.\r\n\r\nThe general absence of structure in the interior of the large fossil\r\ntrees of the Coal implies the very durable nature of their bark, as\r\ncompared with their woody portion. The same difference of durability of\r\nbark and wood exists in modern trees, and was first pointed out to me\r\nby Dr. Dawson, in the forests of Nova Scotia, where the Canoe Birch\r\n(_Betula papyracea_) has such tough bark that it may sometimes be seen\r\nin the swamps looking externally sound and fresh, although consisting\r\nsimply of a hollow cylinder with all the wood decayed and gone. When\r\nportions of such trunks have become submerged in the swamps they are\r\nsometimes found filled with mud. One of the erect fossil trees of the\r\nSouth Joggins fifteen feet in height, occurring at a higher level than\r\nthe main coal, has been shown by Dr. Dawson to have a coniferous\r\nstructure, so that some _Coniferæ_ of the Coal period grew in the same\r\nswamps as _Sigillariæ,_ just as now the deciduous Cypress (_Taxodium\r\ndistichum_) abounds in the marshes of Louisiana even to the edge of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nWhen the carboniferous forests sank below high-water mark, a species of\r\n_Spirorbis_ or _Serpula_ (Fig. 431), attached itself to the outside of\r\nthe stumps and stems of the erect trees, adhering occasionally even to\r\nthe interior of the bark—another proof that the process of envelopment\r\nwas very gradual. These hollow upright trees, covered with innumerable\r\nmarine annelids, reminded me of a “cane-brake,” as it is commonly\r\ncalled, consisting of tall reeds, _Arundinaria macrosperma,_ which I\r\nsaw in 1846, at the Balize, or extremity of the delta of the\r\nMississippi. Although these reeds are fresh-water plants, they were\r\ncovered with barnacles, having been killed by an incursion of\r\nsalt-water over an extent of many acres, where the sea had for a season\r\nusurped a space previously gained from it by the river. Yet the dead\r\nreeds, in spite of this change, remained standing in the soft mud,\r\nenabling us to conceive how easily the larger _ Sigillariæ,_ hollow as\r\nthey were but supported by strong roots, may have resisted an incursion\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nThe high tides of the Bay of Fundy, rising more than 60 feet, are so\r\ndestructive as to undermine and sweep away continually the whole face\r\nof the cliffs, and thus a new crop of erect fossil trees is brought\r\ninto view every three or four years. They are known to extend over a\r\nspace between two and three miles from north to south, and more than\r\ntwice that distance from east to west, being seen in the banks of\r\nstreams intersecting the coal-field.\r\n\r\n_Structure of Coal._—The bituminous coal of Nova Scotia is similar in\r\ncomposition and structure to that of Great Britain, being chiefly\r\nderived from sigillarioid trees mixed with leaves of ferns and of a\r\nLycopodiaceous tree called _ Cordaites_ (_Noeggerathia,_ etc., for\r\ngenus, see Fig. 428), supposed by Dawson to have been deciduous, and\r\nwhich had broad parallel veined leaves without a mid-rib. On the\r\nsurface of the seams of coal are large quantities of mineral charcoal,\r\nwhich doubtless consist, as Dr. Dawson suggests, of fragments of wood\r\nwhich decayed in the open air, as would naturally be expected in swamps\r\nwhere so many erect trees were preserved. Beds of cannel-coal display,\r\nsays Dr. Dawson, such a microscopical structure and chemical\r\ncomposition as shows them to have been of the nature of fine vegetable\r\nmud such as accumulates in the shallow ponds of modern swamps. The\r\nunderclays are loamy soils, which must have been sufficiently above\r\nwater to admit of drainage, and the absence of sulphurets, and the\r\noccurrence of carbonate of iron in them, prove that when they existed\r\nas soils, rain-water, and not sea-water, percolated them. With the\r\nexception, perhaps, of _Asterophyllites_ (see Fig. 461), there is a\r\nremarkable absence from the coal-measures of any form of vegetation\r\nproperly aquatic, the true coal being a sub-aërial accumulation in soil\r\nthat was wet and swampy but not permanently submerged.\r\n\r\nAir-breathers of the Coal.—If we have rightly interpreted the evidence\r\nof the former existence at more than eighty different levels of forests\r\nof trees, some of them of vast extent, and which lasted for ages,\r\ngiving rise to a great accumulation of vegetable matter, it is natural\r\nto ask whether there were not many air-breathing inhabitants of these\r\nsame regions. As yet no remains of mammalia or birds have been found, a\r\nnegative character common at present to all the Palæozoic formations;\r\nbut in 1852 the osseous remains of a reptile, the first ever met with\r\nin the carboniferous strata of the American continent, were found by\r\nDr. Dawson and myself. We detected them in the interior of one of the\r\nerect Sigillariæ before alluded to as of such frequent occurrence in\r\nNova Scotia. The tree was about two feet in diameter, and consisted of\r\nan external cylinder of bark, converted into coal, and an internal\r\nstony axis of black sandstone, or rather mud and sand stained black by\r\ncarbonaceous matter, and cemented together with fragments of wood into\r\na rock. These fragments were in the state of charcoal, and seem to have\r\nfallen to the bottom of the hollow tree while it was rotting away. The\r\nskull, jaws, and vertebræ of a reptile, probably about 2½ feet in\r\nlength (_Dendrerpeton Acadianum,_ Owen), were scattered through this\r\nstony matrix. The shell, also, of a _ Pupa_ (see Fig. 442), the first\r\nland-shell ever met with in the coal or in beds older than the\r\ntertiary, was observed in the same stony mass. Dr. Wyman of Boston\r\npronounced the reptile to be allied in structure to _Menobranchus_ and\r\n_Menopoma,_ species of batrachians, now inhabiting the North American\r\nrivers. The same view was afterwards confirmed by Professor Owen, who\r\nalso pointed out the resemblance of the cranial plates to those seen in\r\nthe skull of _Archegosaurus_ and _Labyrinthodon._[6] Whether the\r\ncreature had crept into the hollow tree while its top was still open to\r\nthe air, or whether it was washed in with mud during a flood, or in\r\nwhatever other manner it entered, must be matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nFootprints of two reptiles of different sizes had previously been\r\nobserved by Dr. Harding and Dr. Gesner on ripple-marked flags of the\r\nlower coal-measures in Nova Scotia (No. 2, Fig. 447), evidently made by\r\nquadrupeds walking on the ancient beach, or out of the water, just as\r\nthe recent Menopoma is sometimes observed to do. The remains of a\r\nsecond and smaller species of Dendrerpeton, _D. Oweni,_ were also found\r\naccompanying the larger one, and still retaining some of its dermal\r\nappendages; and in the same tree were the bones of a third small\r\nlizard-like reptile, _Hylonomus Lyelli,_ seven inches long, with stout\r\nhind limbs, and fore limbs comparatively slender, supposed by Dr.\r\nDawson to be capable of walking and running on land.[7]\r\n\r\nFig. 441: Xylobius Sigillariæ. Coal, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nIn a second specimen of an erect stump of a hollow tree 15 inches in\r\ndiameter, the ribbed bark of which showed that it was a Sigillaria, and\r\nwhich belonged to the same forest as the specimen examined by us in\r\n1852, Dr. Dawson obtained not only fifty specimens of Pupa vetusta\r\n(Fig. 442), and nine skeletons of reptiles belonging to four species,\r\nbut also several examples of an articulated animal resembling the\r\nrecent centipede or gally-worm, a creature which feeds on decayed\r\nvegetable matter (see Fig. 441). Under the microscope, the head, with\r\nthe eyes, mandible, and labrum, are well seen. It is interesting, as\r\nbeing the earliest known representative of the myriapods, none of which\r\nhad previously been met with in rocks older than the oolite or\r\nlithographic slate of Germany.\r\n\r\nFig. 442: Pupa vetusta.\r\nSome years after the discovery of the first Pupa, Dr. Dawson, carefully\r\nexamining the same great section containing so many buried forests in\r\nthe cliffs of Nova Scotia, discovered another bed, separated from the\r\ntree containing Dendrerpeton by a mass of strata more than 1200 feet\r\nthick. As there were 21 seams of coal in this intervening mass, the\r\nlength of time comprised in the interval is not to be measured by the\r\nmere thickness of the sandstones and shales. This lower bed is an\r\nunderclay seven feet thick, with stigmarian rootlets, and the small\r\nland-shells occurring in it are in all stages of growth. They are\r\nchiefly confined to a layer about two inches thick, and are unmixed\r\nwith any aquatic shells. They were all originally entire when imbedded,\r\nbut are most of them now crushed, flattened, and distorted by pressure;\r\nthey must have been accumulated, says Dr. Dawson, in mud deposited in a\r\npond or creek.\r\n\r\nFig. 443: Zonites (Conulus) priseus.\r\n\r\nThe surface striæ of _Pupa vetusta,_ when magnified 50 diameters,\r\npresent exactly the same appearance as a portion corresponding in size\r\nof the common English _Pupa juniperi,_ and the internal hexagonal\r\ncells, magnified 500 diameters, show the internal structure of the\r\nfossil and recent Pupa to be identical. In 1866[8] Dr. Dawson\r\ndiscovered in this lower bed, so full of the Pupa, another land-shell\r\nof the genus Helix (sub-genus Zonites), see Fig. 443.\r\n\r\nNone of the reptiles obtained from the coal-measures of the South\r\nJoggins are of a higher grade than the Labyrinthodonts, but some of\r\nthese were of very great size, two caudal vertebræ found by Mr. Marsh\r\nin 1862 measuring two and a half inches in diameter, and implying a\r\ngigantic aquatic reptile with a powerful swimming tail.\r\n\r\nExcept some obscure traces of an insect found by Dr. Dawson in a\r\ncoprolite of a terrestrial reptile occurring in a fossil tree, no\r\nspecimen of this class has been brought to light in the Joggins. But\r\nMr. James Barnes found in a bed of shale at Little Grace Bay, Cape\r\nBreton, the wing of an Ephemera, which must have measured seven inches\r\nfrom tip to tip of the expanded wings—larger than any known living\r\ninsect of the Neuropterous family.\r\n\r\nThat we should have made so little progress in obtaining a knowledge of\r\nthe terrestrial fauna of the Coal is certainly a mystery, but we have\r\nno reason to wonder at the extreme rarity of insects, seeing how few\r\nare known in the carboniferous rocks of Europe, worked for centuries\r\nbefore America was discovered, and now quarried on so enormous a scale.\r\nThese European rocks have not yet produced a single land-shell, in\r\nspite of the millions of tons of coal annually extracted, and the many\r\nhundreds of soils replete with the fossil roots of trees, and the erect\r\ntrunks and stumps preserved in the position in which they grew. In many\r\nlarge coal-fields we continue as much in the dark respecting the\r\ninvertebrate air-breathers then living, as if the coal had been thrown\r\ndown in mid-ocean. The early date of the carboniferous strata cannot\r\nexplain the enigma, because we know that while the land supported a\r\nluxuriant vegetation, the contemporaneous seas swarmed with life—with\r\nArticulata, Mollusca, Radiata, and Fishes. The perplexity in which we\r\nare involved when we attempt to solve this problem may be owing partly\r\nto our want of diligence as collectors, but still more perhaps to\r\nignorance of the laws which govern the fossilisation of land-animals,\r\nwhether of high or low degree.\r\n\r\nCarboniferous Rain-prints.—At various levels in the coal measures of\r\nNova Scotia, ripple-marked sandstones, and shales with rain-prints,\r\nwere seen by Dr. Dawson and myself, but still more perfect impressions\r\nof rain were discovered by Mr. Brown, near Sydney, in the adjoining\r\nisland of cape Breton. They consist of very delicate markings on\r\ngreenish slates, accompanied by worm-tracks (_a, b,_ Fig. 444), such as\r\nare often seen between high and low water mark on the recent mud of the\r\nBay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nThe great humidity of the climate of the Coal period had been\r\npreviously inferred from the number of its ferns and the continuity of\r\nits forests for hundreds of miles; but it is satisfactory to have at\r\nlength obtained such positive proofs of showers of rain, the drops of\r\nwhich resembled in their average size those which now fall from the\r\nclouds. From such data we may presume that the atmosphere of the\r\nCarboniferous period corresponded in density with that now investing\r\nthe globe, and that different currents of air varied then as now in\r\ntemperature, so as to give rise, by their mixture, to the condensation\r\nof aqueous vapour.\r\n\r\nFig. 444: Carboniferous rain-prints with worm tracks on green shale,\r\nfrom Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Fig. 445: Casts of rain-prints on a\r\nportion of the same slab (Fig. 444), seen to project on the underside\r\nof an incumbent layer of arenaceous shale.\r\n\r\nFolding and Denudation of the Beds indicated by the Nova Scotia\r\nCoal-strata.—The series of events which are indicated by the great\r\nsection of the coal-strata in Nova Scotia consist of a gradual and\r\nlong-continued subsidence of a tract which throughout most of the\r\nperiod was in the state of a delta, though occasionally submerged\r\nbeneath a sea of moderate depth. Deposits of mud and sand were first\r\ncarried down into a shallow sea on the low shores of which the\r\nfootprints of reptiles were sometimes impressed (see p. 407).\r\n\r\nFig. 446: Cone and branch of Lepidodendron corrugatum.\r\nThough no regular seams of coal were formed, the characteristic\r\nimbedded coal-plants are of the genera _Cyclopteris_ and _\r\nAlethopteris,_ agreeing with species occurring at much higher levels,\r\nand distinct from those of the antecedent Devonian group. The\r\n_Lepidodendron corrugatum_ (see Fig. 446), a plant predominating in the\r\nLower Carboniferous group of Europe, is also conspicuous in these\r\nshallow-water beds, together with many fishes and entomostracans. A\r\nmore rapid rate of subsidence sometimes converted part of the sea into\r\ndeep clear water, in which there was a growth of coral which was\r\nafterwards turned into crystalline limestone, and parts of it,\r\napparently by the action of sulphuric acid, into gypsum. In spite of\r\ncontinued sinking, amounting to several thousand feet, the sea might in\r\ntime have been rendered shallow by the growth of coral, had not its\r\nconversion into land or swampy ground been accelerated by the pouring\r\nin of sand and the advance of the delta accompanied with such\r\nfluviatile and brackish-water formations as are common in lagoons.\r\n\r\nThe amount to which the bed of the sea sank down in order to allow of\r\nthe formation of so vast a thickness of rock of sedimentary and organic\r\norigin is expressed by the total thickness of the Carboniferous strata,\r\nincluding the coal-measures, No. 1, and the rocks which underlie them,\r\nNo. 2, Fig. 447.\r\n\r\nFig. 447: Diagram showing the curvature and supposed denudation of the\r\nCarboniferous strata in Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nAfter the strata No. 2 had been elaborated, the conditions proper to a\r\ngreat delta exclusively prevailed, the subsidence still continuing so\r\nthat one forest after another grew and was submerged until their\r\nunder-clays with roots, and usually seams of coal, were left at more\r\nthan eighty distinct levels. Here and there, also, deposits bearing\r\ntestimony to the existence of fresh or brackish-water lagoons, filled\r\nwith calcareo-bituminous mud, were formed. In these beds (_h_ and _i,_\r\nFig. 439) are found fresh-water bivalves or mussels allied to Anodon,\r\nthough not identical with that or any living genus, and called\r\n_Naiadites carbonarius_ by Dawson. They are associated with small\r\nentomostracous crustaceans of the genus Cythere, and scales of small\r\nfishes. Occasionally some of the calamite brakes and forests of\r\nSigillariæ and Coniferæ were exposed in the flood season, or sometimes,\r\nperhaps, by slight elevatory movements to the denuding action of the\r\nriver or the sea.\r\n\r\nIn order to interpret the great coast section exposed to view on the\r\nshores of the Bay of Fundy, the student must, in the first place,\r\nunderstand that the newest or last-mentioned coal formations would have\r\nbeen the only ones known to us (for they would have covered all the\r\nothers), had there not been two great movements in opposite directions,\r\nthe first consisting of a general sinking of three miles, which took\r\nplace during the Carboniferous Period, and the second an upheaval of\r\nmore limited horizontal extent, by which the anticlinal axis A was\r\nformed. That the first great change of level was one of subsidence is\r\nproved by the fact that there are shallow-water deposits at the base of\r\nthe Carboniferous series, or in the lowest beds of No. 2.\r\n\r\nSubsequent movements produced in the Nova Scotia and the adjoining New\r\nBrunswick coal-fields the usual anticlinal and synclinal flexures. In\r\norder to follow these, we must survey the country for about thirty\r\nmiles round the South Joggins, or the region where the erect trees\r\ndescribed in the foregoing pages are seen. As we pass along the cliffs\r\nfor miles in a southerly direction, the beds containing these fossil\r\ntrees, which were mentioned as dipping about 18° south, are less and\r\nless inclined, until they become nearly horizontal in the valley of a\r\nsmall river called the Shoulie, as ascertained by Dr. Dawson. After\r\npassing this synclinal line the beds begin to dip in an opposite or\r\nnorth-easterly direction, acquiring a steep dip where they rest\r\nunconformably on the edges of the Upper Silurian strata of the Cobequid\r\nHills, as shown in Fig. 447. But if we travel northward towards Minudie\r\nfrom the region of the coal-seams and buried forests, we find the dip\r\nof the coal-strata increasing from an angle of 18° to one of more than\r\n40°, lower beds being continually exposed to view until we reach the\r\nanticlinal axis A and see the lower Carboniferous formation, No. 2, at\r\nthe surface. The missing rocks removed by denudation are expressed by\r\nthe faint lines at A, and thus the student will see that, according to\r\nthe principles laid down in the seventh chapter, we are enabled, by the\r\njoint operations of upheaval and denudation, to look, as it were, about\r\nthree miles into the interior of the earth without passing beyond the\r\nlimits of a single formation.\r\n\r\n [1] Edward Hull, Quart.

He reckoned the known species in 1849 at\r\n500, and the number has been largely increased by recent research in\r\nspite of reductions owing to the discovery that different parts of even\r\nthe same plants had been taken for distinct species. Notwithstanding\r\nthese changes, Brongniart’s generalisation concerning this flora still\r\nholds true, namely, that the state of the vegetable world was then\r\nextremely different from that now prevailing, not only because the\r\ncryptogamous plants constituted nearly the whole flora, but also\r\nbecause they were, on the whole, more highly developed than any\r\nbelonging to the same class now existing, and united some forms of\r\nstructure now only found separately and in distinct orders. The only\r\nphænogamous plants were constitute any feature in the coal are the\r\nconiferæ; monocotyledonous angiosperms appear to have been very rare,\r\nand the dicotyledonous, with one or two doubtful exceptions, were\r\nwanting. For this we are in some measure prepared by what we have seen\r\nof the Secondary or Mesozoic floras if, consistently with the belief in\r\nthe theory of evolution, we expect to find the prevalence of simpler\r\nand less specialised organisms in older rocks.\r\n\r\nFerns.—We are struck at the first glance with the similarity of the\r\nferns to those now living. In the fossil genus _Pecopteris,_ for\r\nexample (Fig. 448), it is not easy to decide whether the fossils might\r\nnot be referred to the same genera as those established for living\r\nferns; whereas, in regard to some of the other contemporary families of\r\nplants, with the exception of the fir tribe, it is not easy to guess\r\neven the class to which they belong. The ferns of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod are generally without organs of fructification, but in the few\r\ninstances in which these do occur in a fit state for microscopical\r\ninvestigations they agree with those of the living ferns.\r\n\r\nFig. 448: Pecopteris elliptica. Fig. 449: Caulopteris primæva. Fig.\r\n448: _Pecopteris elliptica_, Bunbury.[2] Frostburg.\r\nFig. 449: _Caulopteris primæva_, Lindley.\r\n\r\nWhen collecting fossil specimens from the coal-measures of Frostburg,\r\nin Maryland, I found in the iron-shales several species with\r\nwell-preserved rounded spots or marks of the sori (see Fig. 448). In\r\nthe general absence of such characters they have been divided into\r\ngenera distinguished chiefly by the branching of the fronds and the way\r\nin which the veins of the leaves are disposed. The larger portion are\r\nsupposed to have been of the size of ordinary European ferns, but some\r\nwere decidedly arborescent, especially the group called _Caulopteris_\r\n(see Fig. 449) by Lindley, and the _Psaronius_ of the upper or newest\r\ncoal-measures, before alluded to (p. 393). All the recent tree-ferns\r\nbelong to one tribe (_Polypodiaceæ_), and to a small number only of\r\ngenera in that tribe, in which the surface of the trunk is marked with\r\nscars, or cicatrices, left after the fall of the fronds. These scars\r\nresemble those of _Caulopteris._\r\n\r\nNo less than 130 species of ferns are enumerated as having been\r\nobtained from the British coal-strata, and this number is more than\r\ndoubled if we include the Continental and American species. Even if we\r\nmake some reduction on the ground of varieties which have been\r\nmistaken, in the absence of their fructification, for species, still\r\nthe result is singular, because the whole of Europe affords at present\r\nno more than sixty-seven indigenous species.\r\n\r\nLiving tree-ferns of different genera. Fig. 450: Tree-fern from Isle of\r\nBourbon. Fig. 451: Cyathea glauca, Mauritius. Fig. 452: Tree-fern from\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nLycopodiaceæ—_Lepidodendron._—About forty species of fossil plants of\r\nthe Coal have been referred to this genus, more than half of which are\r\nfound in the British coal-measures. They consist of cylindrical stems\r\nor trunks, covered with leaf-scars. In their mode of branching, they\r\nare always dichotomous (see Fig. 454). They belong to the\r\n_Lycopodiaceæ,_ bearing sporangia and spores similar to those of the\r\nliving representatives of this family (Fig. 457); and although most of\r\nthe Carboniferous species grew to the size of large trees, Mr.\r\nCarruthers has found by careful measurement that the volume of the\r\nfossil spores did not exceed that of the recent club-moss, a fact of\r\nsome geological importance, as it may help to explain the facility with\r\nwhich these seeds may have been transported by the wind, causing the\r\nsame wide distribution of the species of the fossil forests in Europe\r\nand America which we now observe in the geographical distribution of so\r\nmany living families of cryptogamous plants.\r\n\r\nLepidodendrum Sternbergii. Coal-measures, near Newcastle. Fig. 453:\r\nBranching trunk, 49 feet long, supposed to have belonged to L.\r\nSternbergii. Fig. 454: Branching stem with bark and leaves of L.\r\nSternbergii. Fig. 455: Portion of same, nearer the root.\r\n\r\nFig. 456: a. Lycopodium densum. Living species, New Zealand; b. Branch;\r\nc. Part of same, magnified.\r\nThe Figs. 453–455 represent a fossil _Lepidodendron,_ 49 feet long,\r\nfound in Jarrow Colliery, near Newcastle, lying in shale parallel to\r\nthe planes of stratification. Fragments of others, found in the same\r\nshale, indicate, by the size of the rhomboidal scars which cover them,\r\na still greater magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe living club-mosses, of which there are about 200 species, are most\r\nabundant in tropical climates. They usually creep on the ground, but\r\nsome stand erect, as the _Lycopodium densum_ from New Zealand (see Fig.\r\n456), which attains a height of three feet.\r\n\r\nIn the Carboniferous strata of Coalbrook Dale, and in many other\r\ncoal-fields, elongated cylindrical bodies, called fossil cones, named\r\n_Lepidostrobus_ by M. Adolphe Brongniart, are met with. (See Fig. 457.)\r\nThey often form the nucleus of concretionary balls of clay-ironstone,\r\nand are well preserved, exhibiting a conical axis, around which a great\r\nquantity of scales were compactly imbricated. The opinion of M.\r\nBrongniart that the _ Lepidostrobus_ is the fruit of _Lepidodendron_\r\nhas been confirmed, for these _strobili_ or fruits have been found\r\nterminating the tip of a branch of a well-characterised _\r\nLepidodendron_ in Coalbrook Dale and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFig. 457: a. Lepidostrobus ornatus; b. Portion of a section, showing\r\nthe large sporangia in their natural position, and each supported by\r\nits bract or scale; c. Spores in these sporangia, highly magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 458: Calamites Sucowii, common throughout Europe. Fig. 459: Stem\r\nof Fig. 458, as retored by Dr. Dawson.\r\n\r\nEquisetaceæ.—To this family belong two fossil genera of the coal,\r\n_Equisetites_ and _Calamites._ The Calamites were evidently closely\r\nrelated to the modern horse-tails (Equiseta) differing principally in\r\ntheir great size, the want of sheaths at the joints, and some details\r\nof fructification. They grew in dense brakes on sandy and muddy flats\r\nin the manner of modern Equisetaceæ, and their remains are frequent in\r\nthe coal. Seven species of this plant occur in the great Nova Scotia\r\nsection before described, where the stems of some of them five inches\r\nin diameter, and sometimes eight feet high, may be seen terminating\r\ndownward in a tapering root (see Fig. 460).\r\n\r\nFig. 460: Radical termination of a Calamite. Fig. 461: Asterophyllites\r\nfoliosus, Coal-measures, Newcastle.\r\n\r\nBotanists are not yet agreed whether the _Asterophyllites,_ a species\r\nof which is represented in Fig. 461, can form a separate genus from the\r\nCalamite, from which, however, according to Dr. Dawson, its foliage is\r\ndistinguished by a true mid-rib, which is wanting in the leaves known\r\nto belong to some Calamites.\r\n\r\nFig. 462: Annularia sphenophylloides.Fig. 463: Sphenophyllum erosum.\r\nFigs. 462 and 463 represent leaves of _Annularia_ and _ Sphenophyllum,_\r\ncommon in the coal, and believed by Mr. Carruthers to be leaves of\r\nCalamites. Dr. Williamson, who has carefully studied the Calamites,\r\nthinks that they had a fistular pith, exogenous woody stem, and thick\r\nsmooth bark, which last having always disappeared, leaves a fluted\r\nstem, as represented in Fig. 459.\r\n\r\nSigillaria.—A large portion of the trees of the Carboniferous period\r\nbelonged to this genus, of which as many as 28 species are enumerated\r\nas British. The structure, both internal and external, was very\r\npeculiar, and, with reference to existing types, very anomalous. They\r\nwere formerly referred, by M. Ad. Brongniart, to ferns, which they\r\nresemble in the scalariform texture of their vessels and, in some\r\ndegree, in the form of the cicatrices left by the base of the\r\nleaf-stalks which have fallen off (see Fig. 464). But some of them are\r\nascertained to have had long linear leaves, quite unlike those of\r\nferns. They grew to a great height, from 30 to 60, or even 70 feet,\r\nwith regular cylindrical stems, and without branches, although some\r\nspecies were dichotomous towards the top. Their fluted trunks, from one\r\nto five feet in diameter, appear to have decayed more rapidly in the\r\ninterior than externally, so that they became hollow when standing; and\r\nwhen thrown prostrate, they were squeezed down and flattened. Hence, we\r\nfind the bark of the two opposite sides (now converted into bright\r\nshining coal) constitute two horizontal layers, one upon the other,\r\nhalf an inch, or an inch, in their united thickness. These same trunks,\r\nwhen they are placed obliquely or vertically to the planes of\r\nstratification, retain their original rounded form, and are\r\nuncompressed, the cylinder of bark having been filled with sand, which\r\nnow affords a cast of the interior.\r\n\r\nFig. 464: Sigillaria lævigata.\r\nDr. Hooker inclined to the belief that the _ Sigillariæ_ may have been\r\ncryptogamous, though more highly developed than any flowerless plants\r\nnow living. Dr. Dawson having found in some species what he regards as\r\nmedullary rays, thinks with Brongniart that they have some relation to\r\ngymnogens, while Mr. Carruthers leans to the opinion that they belong\r\nto the Lycopodiaceæ.\r\n\r\n_Stigmaria._—This fossil, the importance of which has already been\r\npointed out in p. 398, was originally conjectured to be an aquatic\r\nplant. It is now ascertained to be the root of _Sigillaria._ The\r\nconnection of the roots with the stem, previously suspected, on\r\nbotanical grounds, by Brongniart, was first proved, by actual contact,\r\nin the Lancashire coal-field, by Mr. Binney. The fact has lately been\r\nshown, even more distinctly, by Mr. Richard Brown, in his description\r\nof the _Stigmariæ_ occurring in the under-clays of the coal-seams of\r\nthe Island of Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia. In a specimen of one of\r\nthese, represented in Fig. 465, the spread of the roots was sixteen\r\nfeet, and some of them sent out rootlets, in all directions, into the\r\nsurrounding clay.\r\n\r\nFig. 465: Stigmaria attached to a trunk of Sigillaria.\r\n\r\nIn the sea-cliffs of the South Joggins in Nova Scotia, I examined\r\nseveral erect _Sigillariæ,_ in company with Dr. Dawson, and we found\r\nthat from the lower extremities of the trunk they sent out _Stigmariæ_\r\nas roots. All the stools of the fossil trees dug out by us divided into\r\nfour parts, and these again bifurcated, forming eight roots, which were\r\nalso dichotomous when traceable far enough. The cylindrical rootlets\r\nformerly regarded as leaves are now shown by more perfect specimens to\r\nhave been attached to the root by fitting into deep cylindrical pits.\r\nIn the fossil there is rarely any trace of the form of these cavities,\r\nin consequence of the shrinkage of the surrounding tissues. Where the\r\nrootlets are removed, nothing remains on the surface of the Stigmaria\r\nbut rows of mammillated tubercles (see Figs. 466, 467), which have\r\nformed the base of each rootlet.\r\n\r\nFig. 466: Stigmaria ficoides. Fig. 467: Surface of another individual\r\nof same species, showing form of tubercles.\r\n\r\nThese protuberances may possibly indicate the place of a joint at the\r\nlower extremity of the rootlet. Rows of these tubercles are arranged\r\nspirally round each root, which have always a medullary axis and woody\r\nsystem much resembling that of _Sigillaria,_ the structure of the\r\nvessels being, like it, scalariform.\r\n\r\nConiferæ.—The coniferous trees of this period are referred to five\r\ngenera; the woody structure of some of them showing that they were\r\nallied to the Araucarian division of pines, more than to any of our\r\ncommon European firs. Some of their trunks exceeded forty-four feet in\r\nheight. Many, if not all of them, seem to have differed from living\r\n_Coniferæ_ in having large piths; for Professor Williamson has\r\ndemonstrated the fossil of the coal-measures called _Sternbergia_ to be\r\nthe pith of these trees, or rather the cast of cavities formed by the\r\nshrinking or partial absorption of the original medullary axis (see\r\nFigs. 468, 469). This peculiar type of pith is observed in living\r\nplants of very different families, such as the common Walnut and the\r\nWhite Jasmine, in which the pith becomes so reduced as simply to form a\r\nthin lining of the medullary cavity, across which transverse plates of\r\npith extend horizontally, so as to divide the cylindrical hollow into\r\ndiscoid interspaces. When these interspaces have been filled up with\r\ninorganic matter, they constitute an axis to which, before their true\r\nnature was known, the provisional name of _Sternbergia_ (_d, d,_ Fig.\r\n468) was given. In the above specimen the structure of the wood (_b,_\r\nFigs. 468 and 469) is coniferous, and the fossil is referable to\r\nEndlicher’s fossil genus _ Dadoxylon._\r\n\r\nFig. 468: Fragment of coniferous wood. Fig. 468: Fragment of coniferous\r\nwood, _Dadoxylon_, of Endlicher, fractured longitudinally; from\r\nCoalbrook Dale.\r\nW.C. Williamson[3]\r\n\r\nFig. 469: Magnified portion of Fig. 468; transverse section.\r\n\r\nThe fossil named _Trigonocarpon_ (Figs. 470 and 471), formerly supposed\r\nto be the fruit of a palm, may now, according to Dr. Hooker, be\r\nreferred, like the _Sternbergia,_ to the _ Coniferæ._ Its geological\r\nimportance is great, for so abundant is it in the coal-measures, that\r\nin certain localities the fruit of some species may be procured by the\r\nbushel; nor is there any part of the formation where they do not occur,\r\nexcept the under-clays and limestone. The sandstone, ironstone, shales,\r\nand coal itself, all contain them. Mr. Binney has at length found in\r\nthe clay-ironstone of Lancashire several specimens displaying\r\nstructure, and from these, says Dr. Hooker, we learn that the _\r\nTrigonocarpon_ belonged to that large section of existing coniferous\r\nplants which bear fleshy solitary fruits, and not cones. It resembled\r\nvery closely the fruit of the Chinese genus _ Salisburia,_ one of the\r\nYew tribe, or Taxoid conifers.\r\n\r\nFig. 470: Trigonocarpum ovatum.Fig. 471: Trigonocarpum olivæforme.\r\nFig. 472: Antholithes.\r\nAngiosperms.—The curious fossils called _ Antholithes_ by Lindley have\r\nusually been considered to be flower spikes, having what seems a calyx\r\nand linear petals (see Fig. 472). Dr. Hooker, after seeing very perfect\r\nspecimens, also thought that they resembled the spike of a\r\nhighly-organised plant in full flower, such as one of the\r\n_Bromeliaceæ,_ to which Professor Lindley had at first compared them.\r\nMr. Carruthers, who has lately examined a large series in different\r\nmuseums, considers it to be a dicotyledonous angiosperm allied to _\r\nOrobanche_ (broom-rape), which grew, not on the soil, but parasitically\r\non the trees of the coal forests.\r\n\r\nIn the coal-measures of Granton, near Edinburgh, a remarkable fossil\r\n(Fig. 473) was found and described in 1840,[4] by Dr. Robert Paterson.\r\nIt was compressed between layers of bituminous shale, and consists of a\r\nstem bearing a cylindrical spike, _a,_ which in the portion preserved\r\nin the slate exhibits two subdivisions and part of a third. The spike\r\nis covered on the exposed surface with the four-cleft calyces of the\r\nflowers arranged in parallel rows. The stem shows, at _b,_ a little\r\nbelow the spike, remains of a lateral appendage, which is supposed to\r\nindicate the beginning of the spathe. The fossil has been referred to\r\nthe _ Aroidiæ,_ and there is every probability that it is a true member\r\nof this order. There can at least be no doubt as to the high grade of\r\nits organisation, and that it belongs to the monocotyledonous\r\nangiosperms. Mr. Carruthers has carefully examined the original\r\nspecimen in the Botanical Museum, Edinburgh, and thinks it may have\r\nbeen an epiphyte.\r\n\r\nFig. 473: Pothocites Grantonii.\r\nClimate of the Coal Period.—As to the climate of the Coal, the Ferns\r\nand the Coniferæ are perhaps the two classes of plants which may be\r\nmost relied upon as leading us to safe conclusions, as the genera are\r\nnearly allied to living types. All botanists admit that the abundance\r\nof ferns implies a moist atmosphere. But the coniferæ, says Hooker, are\r\nof more doubtful import, as they are found in hot and dry, and in cold\r\nand dry climates; in hot and moist, and in cold and moist regions. In\r\nNew Zealand the coniferæ attain their maximum in numbers, constituting\r\n1/62 part of all the flowering plants; whereas in a wide district\r\naround the Cape of Good Hope they do not form 1/1600 of the phenogamic\r\nflora. Besides the conifers, many species of ferns flourish in New\r\nZealand, some of them arborescent, together with many lycopodiums; so\r\nthat a forest in that country may make a nearer approach to the\r\ncarboniferous vegetation than any other now existing on the globe.\r\n\r\nMARINE FAUNA OF THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the Carboniferous or Mountain Limestone\r\nunderlies the coal-measures in the South of England and Wales, whereas\r\nin the North, and in Scotland, marine calcareous rocks partly of the\r\nage of the Mountain Limestone alternate with shales and sandstones,\r\ncontaining seams of coal. In its most calcareous form the Mountain\r\nLimestone is destitute of land-plants, and is loaded with marine\r\nremains—the greater part, indeed, of the rock being made up bodily of\r\ncrinoids, corals, and bryozoa with interspersed mollusca.\r\n\r\nCorals.—The corals deserve especial notice, as the cup-and-star corals,\r\nwhich have the most massive and stony skeletons, display peculiarities\r\nof structure by which they may be distinguished generally, as MM. Milne\r\nEdwards and Haime first pointed out, from all species found in strata\r\nnewer than the Permian. There is, in short, an ancient or _Palæozoic,_\r\nand a modern or _Neozoic_ type, if, by the latter term, we designate\r\n(as proposed by Professor E. Forbes) all strata from the triassic to\r\nthe most modern, inclusive. The accompanying diagrams (Figs. 474, 475)\r\nmay illustrate these types.\r\n\r\nFig. 474: Palæozoic type of lamelliferous cup-shaped Coral.\r\n\r\nVertical section of _Campophyllum flexuosum,_ (_Cyathophyllum,_\r\nGoldfuss); from the Devonian of the Eifel. The lamellæ are seen around\r\nthe inside of the cup; the walls consist of cellular tissue; and large\r\ntransverse plates, called _ tubulæ,_ divide the interior into chambers.\r\n\r\nArrangement of the _lamellæ_ in _Polycoelia profunda,_ Germar, sp.;\r\nfrom the Magnesian Limestone, Durham. This diagram shows the\r\nquadripartite arrangement of the primary septa, characteristic of\r\npalæozoic corals, there being four principal and eight intermediate\r\nlamellæ, the whole number in this type being always a multiple of four.\r\n\r\n_Stauria astræiformis,_ Milne Edwards. Young group, natural size. Upper\r\nSilurian, Gothland. The lamellæ or septal system in each cup are\r\ndivided by four prominent ridges into four groups.\r\n\r\nFig. 475: Neozoic type of lamelliferous cup-shaped Coral.\r\n_Parasmilia centralis,_ Mantell, sp. Vertical section. Upper Chalk,\r\nGravesend. In this type the lamellæ are massive, and extend to the axis\r\nor columella composed of loose cellular tissue, without any transverse\r\nplates like those in Fig. 474, _ a._\r\n\r\n_Cyathina Bowerbankii,_ Ed. and H. Transverse section, enlarged. Gault,\r\nFolkestone. In this coral the primary septa are a multiple of six. The\r\ntwelve principal plates reach the columella, and between each pair\r\nthere are three secondaries, in all forty-eight. The short intermediate\r\nplates which proceed from the columella are not counted. They are\r\ncalled _pali._\r\n\r\n_Fungia patellaris,_ Lamarck. Recent; very young state. Diagram of its\r\nsix primary and six secondary septa, magnified. The sextuple\r\narrangement is always more manifest in the young than in the adult\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the more ancient corals have what is called a\r\nquadripartite arrangement of the chief plates or _ lamellæ_—parts of\r\nthe skeleton which support the organs of reproduction. The number of\r\nthese lamellæ in the Palæozoic type is 4, 8, 16, etc.; while in the\r\nNeozoic type the number is 6, 12, 24, or some other multiple of six;\r\nand this holds good, whether they be simple forms, as in Figs. 474, _\r\na,_ and 475, _a,_ or aggregate clusters of corallites, as in 474, _c._\r\nBut further investigations have shown in this, as in all similar grand\r\ngeneralisations in natural history, that there are excepions to the\r\nrule. Thus in the Lower Greensand _ Holocystis elegans_ (Ed. and H.)\r\nand other forms have the Palæozoic type, and Dr. Duncan has shown to\r\nwhat extent the Neozoic forms penetrate downward into the Carboniferous\r\nand Devonian rocks.\r\n\r\nFig. 476: Lithostrotion basaltiforme. Fig. 477: Lonsdaleia floriformis.\r\n\r\nFrom a great number of lamelliferous corals met with in the Mountain\r\nLimestone, two species (Figs. 476, 477) have been selected, as having a\r\nvery wide range, extending from the eastern borders of Russia to the\r\nBritish Isles, and being found almost everywhere in each country. These\r\nfossils, together with numerous species of _Zaphrentis, Amplexus,\r\nCyathophyllum, Clisiophyllum, Syringopora,_ and _Michelinia,_[5] form a\r\ngroup of rugose corals widely different from any that followed them.\r\n\r\nBryozoa and Crinoidea.—Of the _Bryozoa,_ the prevailing forms are\r\n_Fenestella, Hemitrypa,_ and _ Polypora,_ and these often form\r\nconsiderable beds. Their net-like fronds are easily recognised.\r\n_Crinoidea_ are also numerous in the Mountain Limestone (see Figs. 478,\r\n479), two genera, _Pentremites_ and _Codonaster,_ being peculiar to\r\nthis formation in Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nFig. 478: Cyathocrinus planus. Fig. 479: Cyathocrinus caryocrinoides.\r\n\r\nFig. 480: Palæchinus gigas.\r\nIn the greater part of them, the cup or pelvis, Figure 479, _ b,_ is\r\ngreatly developed in size in proportion to the arms, although this is\r\nnot the case in Fig. 478. The genera _ Poteriocrinus, Cyathocrinus,\r\nPentremites, Actinocrinus,_ and _ Platycrinus,_ are all of them\r\ncharacteristic of this formation. Other Echinoderms are rare, a few\r\nSea-Urchins only being known: these have a complex structure, with many\r\nmore plates on their surface than are seen in the modern genera of the\r\nsame group. One genus, the _Palæchinus_ (Fig. 480), is the analogue of\r\nthe modern _Echinus,_ but has four, five, or six rows of plates in the\r\ninterambulacral region or area, whereas the modern genera have only\r\ntwo. The other, _Archæocidaris,_ represents, in like manner, the\r\n_Cidaris_ of the present seas.\r\n\r\nMollusca.—The British Carboniferous mollusca enumerated by Mr.\r\nEtheridge[6] comprise 653 species referable to 86 genera, occurring\r\nchiefly in the Mountain Limestone. Of this large number only 40 species\r\nare common to the underlying Devonian rocks, 9 of them being\r\nCephalopods, 7 Gasteropods, and the rest bivalves, chiefly Brachiopoda\r\n(or Palliobranchiates). This latter group constitutes the larger part\r\nof the Carboniferous Mollusca, 157 species being known in Great Britain\r\nalone, and it will be found to increase in importance in the fauna of\r\nthe primary rocks the lower we descend in the series. Perhaps the most\r\ncharacteristic shells of the formation are large species of _\r\nProductus,_ such as _P. giganteus, p. hemisphericus, P.\r\nsemireticulatus_ (Fig. 481), and _P. scabriculus._ Large plaited\r\nspirifers, as _Spirifera striata, S. rotundata,_ and _S. trigonalis_\r\n(Fig. 482), also abound; and smooth species, such as _Spirifera glabra_\r\n(Fig. 483), with its numerous varieties.\r\n\r\nFig. 481: Productus semireticulatus. Fig. 482: Spirifera trigonalis.\r\n\r\nFig. 483: Spirifera glabra.\r\nFig. 484: Terebratula hastata. Fig. 485: Aviculopecten sublobatus. Fig.\r\n486: Pleurotomaria carinata.\r\n\r\nAmong the brachiopoda, _Terebratula hastata_ (Fig. 484) deserves\r\nmention, not only for its wide range, but because it often retains the\r\npattern of the original coloured stripes which ornamented the living\r\nshell. These coloured bands are also preserved in several\r\nlamellibranchiate bivalves, as in _ Aviculopecten_ (Fig. 485), in which\r\ndark stripes alternate with a light ground. In some also of the spiral\r\nunivalves the pattern of the original painting is distinctly retained,\r\nas in _ Pleurotomaria_ (Fig. 486), which displays wavy blotches,\r\nresembling the colouring in many recent trochidæ.\r\n\r\nFig. 487: Euomphalus pentagulatus.\r\n\r\nSome few of the carboniferous mollusca, such as Avicula, _ Nucula_\r\n(sub-genus _Ctenodonta_), _Solemya,_ and _ Lithodomus,_ belong no doubt\r\nto existing genera; but the majority, though often referred to as\r\nliving types, such as _ Isocardia, Turritella,_ and _Buccinum,_ belong\r\nreally to forms which appear to have become extinct at the close of the\r\nPalæozoic epoch. _Euomphalus_ is a characteristic univalve shell of\r\nthis period. In the interior it is divided into chambers (Fig. 487,\r\n_d_), the septa or partitions not being perforated as in foraminiferous\r\nshells, or in those having siphuncles, like the Nautilus. The animal\r\nappears to have retreated at different periods of its growth from the\r\ninternal cavity previously formed, and to have closed all communication\r\nwith it by a septum. The number of chambers is irregular, and they are\r\ngenerally wanting in the innermost whorl. The animal of the recent\r\n_Turritella communis_ partitions off in like manner as it advances in\r\nage a part of its spire, forming a shelly septum.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty species of the genus _Bellerophon_ (see Fig. 488), a\r\nshell like the living Argonaut without chambers, occur in the Mountain\r\nLimestone. The genus is not met with in strata of later date. It is\r\nmost generally regarded as belonging to the pelagic Nucleobranchiata\r\nand the family Atlantidæ, partly allied to the Glass-Shell,\r\n_Carinaria_; but by some few it is thought to be a simple form of\r\nCephalopod.\r\n\r\nFig. 488: Bellerophon costatus.\r\nFig. 489: Portion of Orthoxeras laterale. Fig. 490: Goniatites\r\ncrenistra.\r\nThe carboniferous Cephalopoda do not depart so widely from the living\r\ntype (the Nautilus) as do the more ancient Silurian representatives of\r\nthe same order; yet they offer some remarkable forms. Among these is\r\n_Orthoceras,_ a siphuncled and chambered shell, like a Nautilus\r\nuncoiled and straightened (Fig. 489). Some species of this genus are\r\nseveral feet long. The _Goniatite_ is another genus, nearly allied to\r\nthe _Ammonite,_ from which it differs in having the lobes of the septa\r\nfree from lateral denticulations, or crenatures; so that the outline of\r\nthese is angular, continuous, and uninterrupted. The species\r\nrepresented in Fig. 490 is found in most localities, and presents the\r\nzigzag character of the septal lobes in perfection. The dorsal position\r\nof the siphuncle, however, clearly distinguishes the Goniatite from the\r\nNautilus, and proves it to have belonged to the family of the\r\nAmmonites, from which, indeed, some authors do not believe it to be\r\ngenerically distinct.\r\n\r\nFossil Fish.—The distribution of these is singularly partial; so much\r\nso, that M. De Koninck of Liége, the eminent palæontologist, once\r\nstated to me that, in making his extensive collection of the fossils of\r\nthe Mountain Limestone of Belgium, he had found no more than four or\r\nfive examples of the bones or teeth of fishes. Judging from Belgian\r\ndata, he might have concluded that this class of vertebrata was of\r\nextreme rarity in the Carboniferous seas; whereas the investigation of\r\nother countries has led to quite a different result. Thus, near\r\nClifton, on the Avon, as well as at numerous places around the Bristol\r\nbasin from the Mendip Hills to Tortworth, there is a celebrated\r\n“bone-bed,” almost entirely made up of ichthyolites. It occurs at the\r\nbase of the Lower Limestone shales immediately resting upon the passage\r\nbeds of the Old Red Sandstone. Similar bone-beds occur in the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone of Armagh, in Ireland, where they are made up\r\nchiefly of the teeth of fishes of the Placoid order, nearly all of them\r\nrolled as if drifted from a distance. Some teeth are sharp and pointed,\r\nas in ordinary sharks, of which the genus _Cladodus_ afford an\r\nillustration; but the majority, as in _Psammodus_ and _ Cochliodus,_\r\nare, like the teeth of the Cestracion of Port Jackson (see Fig. 261),\r\nmassive palatal teeth fitted for grinding. (See Figs. 491, 492.)\r\n\r\nFig. 491: Psammodus porosus.\r\nFig. 492: Cochliodus controtus.\r\nThere are upward of seventy other species of fossil fish known in the\r\nMountain Limestone of the British Islands. The defensive fin-bones of\r\nthese creatures are not infrequent at Armagh and Bristol; those known\r\nas _Oracanthus, Ctenocanthus,_ and _ Onchus_ are often of a very large\r\nsize. Ganoid fish, such as _ Holoptychius,_ also occur; but these are\r\nfar less numerous. The great _Megalichthys Hibberti_ appears to range\r\nfrom the Upper Coal-measures to the lowest Carboniferous strata.\r\n\r\nForaminifera.—In the upper part of the Mountain Limestone group in the\r\nS.W. of England, near Bristol, limestones having a distinct oolitic\r\nstructure alternate with shales. In these rocks the nucleus of every\r\nminute spherule is seen, under the microscope, to consist of a small\r\nrhizopod or foraminifer. This division of the lower animals, which is\r\nrepresented so fully at later epochs by the Nummulites and their\r\nnumerous minute allies, appears in the Mountain Limestone to be\r\nrestricted to a very few species, among which _Textularia, Nodosaria,\r\nEndothyra,_ and _Fusulina_ (Fig. 493), have been recognised. The first\r\ntwo genera are common to this and all the after periods; the third has\r\nbeen found in the Upper Silurian, but is not known above the\r\nCarboniferous strata; the fourth (Fig. 493) is characteristic of the\r\nMountain Limestone in the United States, Arctic America, Russia, and\r\nAsia Minor, but is also known in the Permian.\r\n\r\nFig. 493: Fusulina cylindrica.\r\n\r\n [1] For botanical nomenclature see p. 304.\r\n\r\n [2] Sir C.

Under the coal came other red\r\nsandstones and shales which were distinguished by the title of “Old Red\r\nSandstone.” Afterwards the name of “Devonian” was given by Sir R.\r\nMurchison and Professor Sedgwick to marine fossiliferous strata which,\r\nin the south of England, occupy a similar position between the\r\noverlying coal and the underlying Silurian formations.\r\n\r\nIt may be truly said that in the British Isles the rocks of this age\r\npresent themselves in their mineral aspect, and even to some extent in\r\ntheir fossil contents, under two very different forms; the one as\r\ndistinct from the other as are often lacustrine or fluviatile from\r\nmarine strata. It has indeed been suggested that by far the greater\r\npart of the deposits belonging to what may be termed the Old Red\r\nSandstone type are of fresh-water origin. The number of land-plants,\r\nthe character of the fishes, and the fact that the only shell yet\r\ndiscovered belongs to the genus _ Anodonta,_ must be allowed to lend no\r\nsmall countenance to this opinion. In this case the difficulty of\r\nclassification when the strata of this type are compared in different\r\nregions, even where they are contiguous, may arise partly from their\r\nhaving been formed in distinct hydrographical basins, or in the\r\nneighbourhood of the land in shallow parts of the sea into which large\r\nbodies of fresh-water entered, and where no marine mollusca or corals\r\ncould flourish. Under such geographical conditions the limited extent\r\nof some kinds of sediment, as well as the absence of those marine forms\r\nby which we are able to identify or contrast marine formations, may be\r\nexplained, while the great thickness of the rocks, which might seem at\r\nfirst sight to require a corresponding depth of water, can often be\r\nshown to have been due to the gradual sinking down of the bottom of the\r\nestuary or sea where the sediment was accumulated.\r\n\r\nAnother active cause of local variation in Scotland was the frequency\r\nof contemporaneous volcanic eruptions; some of the rocks derived from\r\nthis source, as between the Grampians and the Tay, having formed\r\nislands in the sea, and having been converted into shingle and\r\nconglomerate, before the upper portions of the red shales and\r\nsandstones were superimposed.\r\n\r\nThe dearth of calcareous matter over wide areas is characteristic of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone. This is, no doubt, in great part due to the\r\nabsence of shells and corals; but why should these be so generally\r\nwanting in all sedimentary rocks the colour of which is determined by\r\nthe red oxide of iron? Some geologists are of opinion that the waters\r\nimpregnated with this oxide were prejudicial to living beings, others\r\nthat strata permeated with this oxide would not preserve such fossil\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the two types, the Old Red Sandstone and the Devonian, I\r\nshall first treat of them separately, and then allude to the proofs of\r\ntheir having been to a great extent contemporaneous. That they\r\nconstitute a series of rocks intermediate in date between the lowest\r\nCarboniferous and the uppermost Silurian is not disputed by the ablest\r\ngeologists; and it can no longer be contended that the Upper, Middle,\r\nand Lower Old Red Sandstone preceded in date the three divisions to\r\nwhich, by aid of the marine shells, the Devonian rocks have been\r\nreferred, while, on the other hand, we have not yet data for enabling\r\nus to affirm to what extent the subdivisions of the one series may be\r\nthe equivalents in time of those of the other.\r\n\r\nUpper Old Red Sandstone.—The highest beds of the series in Scotland,\r\nlying immediately below the coal in Fife, are composed of yellow\r\nsandstone well seen at Dura Den, near Coupar, in Fife, where, although\r\nthe strata contain no mollusca, fish have been found abundantly, and\r\nhave been referred to the genera _ Holoptychius, Pamphractus,\r\nGlyptopomus,_ and many others. In the county of Cork, in Ireland, a\r\nsimilar yellow sandstone occurs containing fish of genera\r\ncharacteristic of the Scotch Old Red Sandstone, as for example\r\nCoccosteus (a form represented by many species in the Old Red Sandstone\r\nand by one only in the Carboniferous group), and _Glytolepis_ and\r\n_Asterolepis,_ both exclusively confined to the “Old Red.” In the same\r\nIrish sandstone at Kiltorkan has been found an _Anodonta_ or\r\nfresh-water mussel, the only shell hitherto discovered in the Old Red\r\nSandstone of the British Isles (see Fig. 494).\r\n\r\nFig. 494: Anodonta Jukesii.\r\nFig. 495: Bifurcating branch of Lepidendron Griffithsii.\r\nFig. 496: Palæopteris Hibernia.\r\nIn the same formation are found the fern (Fig. 496) and the _\r\nLepidodendron_ (Fig. 495), and other species of plants, some of which,\r\nProfessor Heer remarks, agree specifically with species from the lower\r\ncarboniferous beds. This induces him to lean to the opinion long ago\r\nadvocated by Sir Richard Griffiths, that the yellow sandstone, in spite\r\nof its fish remains, should be classed as Lower Carboniferous, an\r\nopinion which I am not yet prepared to adopt. Between the Mountain\r\nLimestone and the yellow sandstone in the south-west of Ireland there\r\nintervenes a formation no less than 5000 feet thick, called the\r\n“Carboniferous slate,” and at the base of this, in some places, are\r\nlocal deposits, such as the Glengariff Grits, which appear to be beds\r\nof passage between the Carboniferous and Old Red Sandstone groups.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable result of the recent examination of the fossil flora\r\nof Bear Island, latitude 74° 30′ N., that Professor Heer has described\r\nas occurring in that part of the Arctic region (nearly twenty-six\r\ndegrees to the north of the Irish locality) a flora agreeing in several\r\nof its species with that of the yellow sandstones of Ireland. This Bear\r\nIsland flora is believed by Professor Heer to comprise species of\r\nplants some of which ascend even to the higher stages of the European\r\nCarboniferous formation, or as high as the Mountain Limestone and\r\nMillstone Grit. Palæontologists have long maintained that the same\r\nspecies which have a wide range in space are also the most persistent\r\nin time, which may prepare us to find that some plants having a vast\r\ngeographical range may also have endured from the period of the Upper\r\nDevonian to that of the Millstone Grit.\r\n\r\nFig. 497: Scale of Holoptychius nobilissimus.\r\n\r\nOutliers of the Upper “Old Red” occur unconformably on older members of\r\nthe group, and the formation represented at Whiteness, near Arbroath,\r\n_a,_ Fig. 55, may probably be one of these outliers, though the want of\r\norganic remains renders this uncertain. It is not improbable that the\r\nbeds given in this section as Nos. 1, 2, and 3, may all belong to the\r\nearly part of the period of the Upper Old Red, as some scales of\r\n_Holoptychius nobilissimus_ have been found scattered through these\r\nbeds, No. 2, in Strathmore. Another nearly allied _Holoptychius_ occurs\r\nin Dura Den, see Fig. 498 of this fish and also Fig. 497 of one of its\r\nscales, as these last are often the only parts met with; being\r\nscattered in Forfarshire through red-coloured shales and sandstones, as\r\nare scales of a large species of the same genus in a corresponding\r\nmatrix in Herefordshire.[1] The number of fish obtained from the\r\nBritish Upper Old Red Sandstone amounts to fifteen species referred to\r\neleven genera.\r\n\r\nFig. 498: Holoptychius, as restored by Professor Huxley.\r\n\r\nSir R. Murchison groups with this upper division of the Old Red of\r\nScotland certain light-red and yellow sandstones and grits which occur\r\nin the northernmost part of the mainland, and extend also into the\r\nOrkney and Shetland Islands. They contain Calamites and other plants\r\nwhich agree generically with Carboniferous forms.\r\n\r\nMiddle Old Red Sandstone.—In the northern part of Scotland there occur\r\na great series of bituminous schists and flagstones, to the fossil fish\r\nof which attention was first called by the late Hugh Miller. They were\r\nafterwards described by Agassiz, and the rocks containing them were\r\nexamined by Sir R. Murchison and Professor Sedgwick, in Caithness,\r\nCromarty, Moray, Nairn, Gamrie in Banff, and the Orkneys and Shetlands,\r\nin which great numbers of fossil fish have been found. These were at\r\nfirst supposed to be the oldest known vertebrate animals, as in\r\nCromarty the beds in which they occur seem to form the base of the Old\r\nRed system resting almost immediately on the crystalline or metamorphic\r\nrocks. But in fact these fish-bearing beds, when they are traced from\r\nnorth to south, or to the central parts of Scotland, thin out, so that\r\ntheir relative age to the Lower Old Red Sandstone, presently to be\r\nmentioned, was not at first detected, the two formations not appearing\r\nin superposition in the same district. In Caithness, however, many\r\nhundred feet below the fish-zone of the middle division, remains of\r\n_Pteraspis_ were found by Mr. Peach in 1861. This genus has never yet\r\nbeen found in either of the two higher divisions of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, and confirms Sir R. Murchison’s previous suspicion that the\r\nrocks in which it occurs belong to the Lower “Old Red,” or agree in age\r\nwith the Arbroath paving-stone.[2]\r\n\r\n_Fossil Fish of the Middle Old Red Sandstone._—The Devonian fish were\r\nreferred by Agassiz to two of his great orders, namely, the Placoids\r\nand Ganoids. Of the first of these, which in the Recent period comprise\r\nthe shark, the dog-fish, and the ray, no entire skeletons are\r\npreserved, but fin-spines, called ichthyodorulites, and teeth occur. On\r\nsuch remains the genera _ Onchus, Odontacanthus,_ and _Ctenodus,_ a\r\nsupposed cestraciont, and some others, have been established.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of the Old Red Sandstone fishes belong to a\r\nsub-order of Ganoids instituted by Huxley in 1861, and for which he has\r\nproposed the name of _ Crossopterygidæ_,[3] or the fringe-finned, in\r\nconsideration of the peculiar manner in which the fin-rays of the\r\npaired fins are arranged so as to form a fringe round a central lobe,\r\nas in the Polypterus (see _a,_ Fig. 499), a genus of which there are\r\nseveral species now inhabiting the Nile and other African rivers. The\r\nreader will at once recognise in _ Osteolepis_ (Fig. 500), one of the\r\ncommon fishes of the Old Red Sandstone, many points of analogy with\r\n_Polypterus._ They not only agree in the structure of the fin, at first\r\npointed out by Huxley, but also in the position of the pectoral,\r\nventral, and anal fins, and in having an elongated body and rhomboidal\r\nscales. On the other hand, the tail is more symmetrical in the recent\r\nfish, which has also an apparatus of dorsal finlets of a very abnormal\r\ncharacter, both as to number and structure. As to the dorsals of\r\n_Osteolepis,_ they are regular in structure and position, having\r\nnothing remarkable about them, except that there are two of them, which\r\nis comparatively unusual in living fish.\r\n\r\nFig. 499: Polypterus. Living in the Nile and other rivers.\r\n\r\nFig. 500: Restoration of Osteolepis.\r\n\r\nAmong the “fringe-finned” Ganoids we find some with rhomboidal scales,\r\nsuch as _Osteolepis,_ Fig. 500; others with cycloidal scales, as\r\n_Holoptychius,_ before mentioned (see Fig. 498). In the genera\r\n_Dipterus_ and _Diplopterus,_ as Hugh Miller pointed out, and in\r\nseveral other of the fringe-finned genera, as in _Gyroptychius_ and\r\n_Glyptolepis,_ the two dorsals are placed far backward, or directly\r\nover the ventral and anal fins. The _Asterolepis_ was a ganoid fish of\r\ngigantic dimensions. _A. Asmusii,_ Eichwald, a species characteristic\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone of Russia, as well as that of Scotland,\r\nattained the length of between twenty and thirty feet. It was clothed\r\nwith strong bony armour, embossed with star-like tubercles, but it had\r\nonly a cartilaginous skeleton. The mouth was furnished with two rows of\r\nteeth, the outer ones small and fish-like, the inner larger and with a\r\nreptilian character. The _Asterolepis_ occurs also in the Devonian\r\nrocks of North America.\r\n\r\nIf we except the Placoids already alluded to, and a few other families\r\nof doubtful affinities, all the Old Red Sandstone fishes are Ganoids,\r\nan order so named by Agassiz from the shining outer surface of their\r\nscales; but Professor Huxley has also called our attention to the fact\r\nthat, while a few of the primary and the great majority of the\r\nsecondary Ganoids resemble the living bony pike, _Lepidosteus,_ or the\r\n_Amia,_ genera now found in North American rivers, and one of them,\r\n_Lepidosteus,_ extending as far south as Guatemala, the Crossopterygii,\r\nor fringe-finned Ichthyolites, of the Old Red are closely related to\r\nthe African _Polypterus,_ which is represented by five or six species\r\nnow inhabiting the Nile and the rivers of Senegal. These North American\r\nand African Ganoids are quite exceptional in the living creation; they\r\nare entirely confined to the northern hemisphere, unless some species\r\nof _Polypterus_ range to the south of the line in Africa; and, out of\r\nabout 9000 living species of fish known to M. Günther, and of which\r\nmore than 6000 are now preserved in the British Museum, they probably\r\nconstitute no more than nine.\r\n\r\nFig. 501: Pterichthys. Upper side, showing mouth.\r\nIf many circumstances favour the theory of the fresh-water origin of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone, this view of its nature is not a little\r\nconfirmed by our finding that it is in Llake Superior and the other\r\ninland Canadian seas of fresh water, and in the Mississippi and African\r\nrivers, that we at present find those fish which have the nearest\r\naffinity to the fossil forms of this ancient formation.\r\n\r\nAmong the anomalous forms of Old Red fishes not referable to Huxley’s\r\nCrossopterygii is the _Pterichthys,_ of which five species have been\r\nfound in the middle division of the Old Red of Scotland. Some writers\r\nhave compared their shelly covering to that of Crustaceans, with which,\r\nhowever, they have no real affinity. The wing-like appendages, whence\r\nthe genus is named, were first supposed by Hugh Miller to be paddles,\r\nlike those of the turtle; and there can now be no doubt that they do\r\nreally correspond with the pectoral fins.\r\n\r\nThe number of species of fish already obtained from the middle division\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone in Great Britain is about 70, and the\r\nprincipal genera, besides _Osteolepis_ and _ Pterichthys,_ already\r\nmentioned, are _Glyptolepis, Diplacanthus, Dendrodus, Coccosteus,\r\nCheirancanthus,_ and _ Acanthoides._\r\n\r\nFig. 502: Cephalapsis Lyellii.\r\n\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone.—The third or lowest division south of the\r\nGrampians consists of grey paving-stone and roofing-slate, with\r\nassociated red and grey shales; these strata underlie a dense mass of\r\nconglomerate. In these grey beds several remarkable fish have been\r\nfound of the genus named by Agassiz _ Cephalaspis,_ or\r\n“buckler-headed,” from the extraordinary shield which covers the head\r\n(see Fig. 502), and which has often been mistaken for that of a\r\ntrilobite, such as _ Asaphus._ A species of _Pteraspis,_ of the same\r\nfamily, has also been found by the Reverend Hugh Mitchell in beds of\r\ncorresponding age in Perthshire; and Mr. Powrie enumerates no less than\r\nfive genera of the family Acanthodidæ, the spines, scales, and other\r\nremains of which have been detected in the grey flaggy sandstones.[4]\r\n\r\nFig. 503: Pteygotus anglicus.\r\nIn the same formation at Carmylie, in Forfarshire, commonly known as\r\nthe Arbroath paving-stone, fragments of a huge crustacean have been met\r\nwith from time to time. They are called by the Scotch quarrymen the\r\n“Seraphim,” from the wing-like form and feather-like ornament of the\r\nthoracic appendage, the part most usually met with. Agassiz, having\r\npreviously referred some of these fragments to the class of fishes, was\r\nthe first to recognise their crustacean character, and, although at the\r\ntime unable correctly to determine the true relation of the several\r\nparts, he figured the portions on which he founded his opinion, in the\r\nfirst plate of his “Poissons Fossiles du Vieux Grès Rouge.”\r\n\r\nFig. 504: Pterygotus anglicus.

Telson, or tail-plate.)\r\n\r\nA restoration in correct proportion to the size of the fragments of _P.\r\nanglicus_ (Fig. 504), from the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Perthshire\r\nand Forfarshire, would give us a creature measuring from five to six\r\nfeet in length, and more than one foot across.\r\n\r\nThe largest crustaceans living at the present day are the _ Inachus\r\nKaempferi,_ of De Haan, from Japan (a brachyurous or short-tailed\r\ncrab), chiefly remarkable for the extraordinary length of its limbs;\r\nthe fore-arm measuring four feet in length, and the others in\r\nproportion, so that it covers about 25 square feet of ground; and the\r\n_Limulus Moluccanus,_ the great King Crab of China and the Eastern\r\nseas, which, when adult, measures 1½ foot across its carapace, and is\r\nthree feet in length.\r\n\r\nBesides some species of _Pterygotus,_ several of the allied genus\r\n_Eurypterus_ occur in the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and with them the\r\nremains of grass-like plants so abundant in Forfarshire and\r\nKincardineshire as to be useful to the geologist by enabling him to\r\nidentify the inferior strata at distant points. Some botanists have\r\nsuggested that these plants may be of the family _Fluviales,_ and of\r\nfresh-water genera. They are accompanied by fossils, called “berries”\r\nby the quarrymen, which they compared to a compressed blackberry (see\r\nFigs. 505, 506), and which were called “Parka” by Dr. Fleming. They are\r\nnow considered by Mr. Powrie to be the eggs of crustaceans, which is\r\nhighly probable, for they have not only been found with _Pterygotus\r\nanglicus_ in Forfarshire and Perthshire, but also in the Upper Silurian\r\nstrata of England, in which species of the same genus, Pterygotus,\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nFig. 505: Parka decipiens. In sandstone of lower beds of Old Red, Ley’s\r\nMill, Forfarshire. Fig. 506: Parka decipiens. In shale of Lower Old\r\nRed, Park Hill, Fife.\r\n\r\nFig. 507: Shale of Old Red Sandstone. Forfarshire. With impression of\r\nplants and eggs of Crustaceans.\r\nThe grandest exhibitions, says Sir R. Murchison, of the Old Red\r\nSandstone in England and Wales appear in the escarpments of the Black\r\nMountains and in the Fans of Brecon and Carmarthen, the one 2862, and\r\nthe other 2590 feet above the sea. The mass of red and brown sandstone\r\nin these mountains is estimated at not less than 10,000 feet, clearly\r\nintercalated between the Carboniferous and Silurian strata. No shells\r\nor corals have ever been found in the whole series, not even where the\r\nbeds are calcareous, forming irregular courses of concretionary lumps\r\ncalled “corn-stones,” which may be described as mottled red and green\r\nearthy limestones. The fishes of this lowest English Old Red are\r\n_Cephalaspis_ and _Pteraspis,_ specifically different from species of\r\nthe same genera which occur in the uppermost Ludlow or Silurian\r\ntilestones. Crustaceans also of the genus _Eurypterus_ are met with.\r\n\r\nMarine or Devonian Type.—We may now speak of the marine type of the\r\nBritish strata intermediate between the Carboniferous and Silurian, in\r\ntreating of which we shall find it much more easy to identify the\r\nUpper, Middle, and Lower divisions with strata of the same age in other\r\ncountries. It was not until the year 1836 that Sir R. Murchison and\r\nProfessor Sedgwick discovered that the culmiferous or anthracitic\r\nshales and sandstones of North Devon, several thousand feet thick,\r\nbelonged to the coal, and that the beds below them, which are of still\r\ngreater thickness, and which, like the carboniferous strata, had been\r\nconfounded under the general name “graywacke,” occupied a geological\r\nposition corresponding to that of the Old Red Sandstone already\r\ndescribed. In this reform they were aided by a suggestion of Mr.\r\nLonsdale, who, after studying the Devonshire fossils, perceived that\r\nthey belonged to a peculiar palæontological type of intermediate\r\ncharacter between the Carboniferous and Silurian.\r\n\r\nIt is in the north of Devon that these formations may best be studied,\r\nwhere they have been divided into an Upper, Middle, and Lower Group,\r\nand where, although much contorted and folded, they have for the most\r\npart escaped being altered by intrusive trap-rocks and by granite,\r\nwhich in Dartmoor and the more southern parts of the same county have\r\noften reduced them to a crystalline or metamorphic state.\r\n\r\nDEVONIAN SERIES IN NORTH DEVON.\r\n\r\nUPPER DEVONIAN OR PILTON GROUP (a) Sandy slates and schists with\r\nfossils, 36 species out of 110 common to the Carboniferous group\r\n(Pilton, Barnstaple, etc.), resting on soft schists in which fossils\r\nare very abundant (Croyde, etc.), and which pass down into\r\n(b) Yellow, brown, and red sandstone, with land plants (_Cyclopteris,_\r\netc.) and marine shells. One zone, characterised by the abundance of\r\ncucullæa (Baggy Point, Marwood, Sloly, etc.) resting on hard grey and\r\nreddish sandstone and micaceous flags, no fossils yet found (Dulverton,\r\nPickwell, Down, etc.) MIDDLE DEVONIAN OR ILFRACOMBE GROUP. (a) Green\r\nglossy slates of considerable thickness, no fossils yet recorded from\r\nthese beds (Mortenoe, Lee Bay, etc.).\r\n(b) Slates and schists, with several irregular courses of limestone\r\ncontaining shells and corals like those of the Plymouth Limestone\r\n(Combe Martin, Ilfracombe, etc.). LOWER DEVONIAN OR LYNTON\r\nGROUP. (a) Hard, greenish, red, and purple sandstone—no fossils yet\r\nfound (Hangman Hill, etc.).\r\n(b) Soft slates with subordinate sandstones—fossils numerous at various\r\nhorizons—Orthis, Corals, Encrinites, etc. (Valley of Rocks, Lynmouth,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\nThe above table exhibits the sequence of the strata or subdivisions as\r\nseen both on the sea-coast of the British Channel and in the interior\r\nof Devon. It will be seen that in all main points it agrees with the\r\ntable drawn up in 1864 for the sixth edition of my “Elements.” Mr.\r\nEtheridge[5] has since published an excellent account of the different\r\nsubdivisions of the rocks and their fossils, and has also pointed out\r\ntheir relation to the corresponding marine strata of the Continent. The\r\nslight modifications introduced in my table since 1864 are the result\r\nof a tour made in 1870 in company with Mr. T. Mck. Hughes, when we had\r\nthe advantage of Mr. Etheridge’s memoir as our guide.\r\n\r\nThe place of the sandstones of the Foreland is not yet clearly made\r\nout, as they are cut off by a great fault and disturbance.\r\n\r\nFig. 508: Spirifera disjuncta. Fig. 509: Phacops latifrons.\r\nUpper Devonian Rocks.—The slates and sandstones of Barnstaple (_a_ and\r\n_b_ of the preceding section) contain the shell _Spirifera disjuncta,_\r\nSowerby (S. Verneuilii, Murch.), (see Fig. 508), which has a very wide\r\nrange in Europe, Asia Minor, and even China; also _Strophalosia\r\ncaperata,_ together with the large trilobite _Phacops latifrons,_\r\nBronn. (See Fig. 509), which is all but world-wide in its distribution.\r\nThe fossils are numerous, and comprise about 150 species of mollusca, a\r\nfifth of which pass up into the overlying Carboniferous rocks. To this\r\nUpper Devonian belong a series of limestones and slates well developed\r\nat Petherwyn, in Cornwall, where they have yielded 75 species of\r\nfossils. The genus of Cephalopoda called _ Clymenia_ (Fig. 510) is\r\nrepresented by no less than eleven species, and strata occupying the\r\nsame position in Germany are called Clymenien-Kalk, or sometimes\r\nCypridinen-Schiefer, on account of the number of minute bivalve shells\r\nof the crustacean called _ Cypridina serrato-striata_ (Fig. 511), which\r\nis found in these beds, in the Rhenish provinces, the Harz, Saxony, and\r\nSilesia, as well as in Cornwall and Belgium.\r\n\r\nMiddle Devonian Rocks.—We come next to the most typical portion of the\r\nDevonian system, including the great limestones of Plymouth and Torbay,\r\nreplete with shells, trilobites, and corals. Of the corals 51 species\r\nare enumerated by Mr. Etheridge, none of which pass into the\r\nCarboniferous formation. Among the genera we find _Favosites,\r\nHeliolites,_ and _Cyathophyllum._ The two former genera are very\r\nfrequent in Silurian rocks: some few even of the species are said to be\r\ncommon to the Devonian and Silurian groups, as, for example, _Favosites\r\ncervicornis_ (Fig. 513), one of the commonest of all the Devonshire\r\nfossils. The _Cyathophyllum cæspitosum_ (Fig. 514) and _Heliolites\r\npyriformis_ (Fig. 512) are species peculiar to this formation.\r\n\r\nFig. 510: Clymenia linearis. Fig. 511: Cypridina serrato-striata.\r\n\r\nFig. 512: Heliolites porosa.\r\nFig. 513: Favosites cervicornis. Fig. 514: Cyathophyllum cæspitosum.\r\n\r\nFig. 515: Stringocephalus Burtini. Fig. 516: Uncites Gryphus.\r\n\r\nWith the above are found no less than eleven genera of stone-lilies or\r\ncrinoids, some of them, such as _ Cupressocrinites,_ distinct from any\r\nCarboniferous forms. The mollusks, also, are no less characteristic; of\r\n68 species of Brachiopoda, ten only are common to the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone. The _Stringocephalus Burtini_ (Fig. 515) and _Uncites\r\nGryphus_ (Fig. 516) may be mentioned as exclusively Middle Devonian\r\ngenera, and extremely characteristic of the same division in Belgium.\r\nThe _Stringocephalus_ is also so abundant in the Middle Devonian of the\r\nbanks of the Rhine as to have suggested the name of Stringocephalus\r\nLimestone.\r\n\r\nFig. 517: Megalodon cucullatus.\r\nThe only two species of Brachiopoda common to the Silurian and Devonian\r\nformations are _Atrypa reticularis_ (Fig. 532), which seems to have\r\nbeen a cosmopolite species, and _Strophomena rhomboidalis._\r\n\r\nAmong the peculiar lamellibranchiate bivalves common to the Plymouth\r\nlimestone of Devonshire and the Continent, we find the _ Megalodon_\r\n(Fig. 517). There are also twelve genera of Gasteropods which have\r\nyielded 36 species, four of which pass to the Carboniferous group,\r\nnamely _Macrocheilus,_ _Acroculia, Euomphalus,_ and _Murchisonia._\r\nPteropods occur, such as _Conularia_ (Fig. 518), and Cephalopods, such\r\nas _Cyrtoceras, Gyroceras, Orthoceras,_ and others, nearly all of\r\ngenera distinct from those prevailing in the Upper Devonian Limestone,\r\nor Clymenien-kalk of the Germans already mentioned. Although but few\r\nspecies of Trilobites occur, the characteristic _Bronteus flabellifer_\r\n(Fig. 519) is far from rare, and all collectors are familiar with its\r\nfan-like tail. In this same group, called, as before stated, the\r\nStringocephalus, or Eifel Limestone, in Germany, several fish remains\r\nhave been detected, and among others the remarkable genus Coccosteus,\r\ncovered with its tuberculated bony armour; and these ichthyolites\r\nserve, as Sir R. Murchison observes (Siluria, p. 362), to identify this\r\nmiddle marine Devonian with the Old Red Sandstone of Britain and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nFig. 518: Conularia ornata.Fig. 519: Bronteus flabellifer.\r\nFig. 520: Calceola sandalina.\r\nBeneath the Eifel Limestone (the great central and typical member of\r\n“the Devonian” on the Continent) lie certain schists called by German\r\nwriters “Calceola-schiefer,” because they contain in abundance a fossil\r\nbody of very curious structure, _Calceola sandalina_ (Fig. 520), which\r\nhas been usually considered a brachiopod, but which some naturalists\r\nhave lately referred to a Goniophyllum, supposing it to be an abnormal\r\nform of the order _Zoantharia rugosa_ (see Fig. 474), differing from\r\nall other corals in being furnished with a strong operculum. This is by\r\nno means a rare fossil in the slaty limestone of South Devon, and, like\r\nthe Eifel form, is confined to the middle group of this country.\r\n\r\nLower Devonian Rocks.—A great series of sandstones and glossy slates,\r\nwith Crinoids, Brachiopods, and some corals, occurring on the coast at\r\nLynmouth and the neighbourhood, and called the Lynton Group (see Table\r\np. 449, form the lowest member of the Devonian in North Devon. Among\r\nthe 18 species of all classes enumerated by Mr. Etheridge, two-thirds\r\nare common to the Middle Devonian, but only one, the ubiquitous _\r\nAtrypa reticularis,_ can with certainty be identified with Silurian\r\nspecies. Among the characteristic forms are _Alveolites\r\nsuborbicularis,_ also common to this formation in the Rhine, and\r\n_Orthis arcuata,_ very widely spread in the North Devon localities. But\r\nwe may expect a large addition to the number of fossils whenever these\r\nstrata shall have been carefully searched. The Spirifer Sandstone of\r\nSandberger, as exhibited in the rocks bordering the Rhine between\r\nCoblentz and Caub, belong to this Lower division, and the same\r\nbroad-winged Spirifers distinguish the Devonian strata of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nFig. 521: Spirifora mucronata.\r\nFig. 522: Homalonotus armatus.\r\nAmong the Trilobites of this era several large species of _\r\nHomalonotus_ (Fig. 522) are conspicuous. The genus is still better\r\nknown as a Silurian form, but the spinose species appear to belong\r\nexclusively to the “Lower Devonian,” and are found in Britain, Europe,\r\nand the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nDevonian of Russia.—The Devonian strata of Russia extend, according to\r\nSir R. Murchison, over a region more spacious than the British Isles;\r\nand it is remarkable that, where they consist of sandstone like the\r\n“Old Red” of Scotland and Central England, they are tenanted by fossil\r\nfishes often of the same species and still oftener of the same genera\r\nas the British, whereas when they consist of limestone they contain\r\nshells similar to those of Devonshire, thus confirming, as Sir Roderick\r\nhas pointed out, the contemporaneous origin which had been previously\r\nassigned to formations exhibiting two very distinct mineral types in\r\ndifferent parts of Britain.[6] The calcareous and the arenaceous rocks\r\nof Russia above alluded to alternate in such a manner as to leave no\r\ndoubt of their having been deposited in different parts of the same\r\ngreat period.\r\n\r\nFig. 523: Psilophyton princeps.\r\nDevonian Strata in the United States and Canada.—Between the\r\nCarboniferous and Silurian strata there intervenes, in the United\r\nStates and Canada, a great series of formations referable to the\r\nDevonian group, comprising some strata of marine origin abounding in\r\nshells and corals, and others of shallow-water and littoral origin in\r\nwhich terrestrial plants abound. The fossils, both of the deep and\r\nshallow water strata, are very analogous to those of Europe, the\r\nspecies being in some cases the same. In Eastern Canada Sir W. Logan\r\nhas pointed out that in the peninsula of Gaspe, south of the estuary of\r\nSt. Lawrence, a mass of sandstone, conglomerate, and shale referable to\r\nthis period occurs, rich in vegetable remains, together with some\r\nfish-spines. Far down in the sandstones of Gaspe, Dr. Dawson found, in\r\n1869, an entire specimen of the genus _Cephalaspis,_ a form so\r\ncharacteristic, as we have already seen, of the Scotch Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone. Some of the sandstones are ripple-marked, and towards the\r\nupper part of the whole series a thin seam of coal has been observed,\r\nmeasuring, together with some associated carbonaceous shale, about\r\nthree inches in thickness. It rests on an under-clay in which are the\r\nroots of Psilophyton (see Fig. 523). At many other levels rootlets of\r\nthis same plant have been shown by Principal Dawson to penetrate the\r\nclays, and to play the same part as do the rootlets of Stigmaria in the\r\ncoal formation.\r\n\r\nWe had already learnt from the works of Göppert, Unger, and Bronn that\r\nthe European plants of the Devonian epoch resemble generically, with\r\nfew exceptions, those already known as Carboniferous; and Dr. Dawson,\r\nin 1859, enumerated 32 genera and 69 species which he had then obtained\r\nfrom the State of New York and Canada. A perusal of his catalogue,[7]\r\ncomprising _Coniferæ, Sigillariæ, Calamites, Asterophyllites,\r\nLepidodendra,_ and ferns of the genera _Cyclopteris, Neuropteris,\r\nSphenopteris,_ and others, together with fruits, such as _Cardiocarpum_\r\nand _Trigonocarpum,_ might dispose geologists to believe that they were\r\npresented with a list of Carboniferous fossils, the difference of the\r\nspecies from those of the coal-measures, and even a slight admixture of\r\ngenera unknown in Europe, being naturally ascribed to geographical\r\ndistribution and the distance of the New from the Old World. But\r\nfortunately the coal formation is fully developed on the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic, and is singularly like that of Europe, both\r\nlithologically and in the species of its fossil plants. There is also\r\nthe most unequivocal evidence of relative age afforded by\r\nsuperposition, for the Devonian strata in the United States are seen to\r\ncrop out from beneath the Carboniferous on the borders of Pennsylvania\r\nand New York, where both formations are of great thickness.\r\n\r\nThe number of American Devonian plants has now been raised by Dr.\r\nDawson to 120, to which we may add about 80 from the European flora of\r\nthe same age, so that already the vegetation of this period is\r\nbeginning to be nearly half as rich as that of the coal-measures which\r\nhave been studied for so much longer a time and over so much wider an\r\narea. The Psilophyton above alluded to is believed by Dr. Dawson to be\r\na lycopodiaceous plant, branching dichotomously (see _P. princeps,_\r\nFig. 523), with stems springing from a rhizome, which last has circular\r\nareoles, much resembling those of Stigmaria, and like it sending forth\r\ncylindrical rootlets. The extreme points of some of the branchlets are\r\nrolled up so as to resemble the croziers or circinate vernation of\r\nferns; the leaves or bracts, _a,_ supposed to belong to the same plant,\r\nare described by Dawson as having inclosed the fructification. The\r\nremains of _Psilophyton princeps_ have been traced through all the\r\nmembers of the Devonian series in America, and Dr. Dawson has lately\r\nrecognised it in specimens of Old Red Sandstone from the north of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous character of the Carboniferous flora might be explained\r\nby imagining that we have only the vegetation handed down to us of one\r\nset of stations, consisting of wide swampy flats. But Dr. Dawson\r\nsupposes that the geographical conditions under which the Devonian\r\nplants grew were more varied, and had more of an upland character. If\r\nso, the limitation of this more ancient flora, represented by so many\r\ngenera and species, to the gymnospermous and cryptogamous orders, and\r\nthe absence or extreme rarity of plants of higher grade, lead us\r\nnaturally to speculate on the theory of progressive development,\r\nhowever difficult it may be to avail ourselves of this explanation, so\r\nlong as we meet with even a few exceptional cases of what may seem to\r\nbe monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous exogens.\r\n\r\nDevonian Insects of Canada.—The earliest known insects were brought to\r\nlight in 1865 in the Devonian strata of St. John’s, New Brunswick, and\r\nare referred by Mr. Scudder to four species of _Neuroptera._ One of\r\nthem is a gigantic Ephemera, and measured five inches in expanse of\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nLike many other ancient animals, says Dr. Dawson, they show a\r\nremarkable union of characters now found in distinct orders of insects,\r\nor constitute what have been named “synthetic types.” Of this kind is a\r\nstridulating or musical apparatus like that of the cricket in an insect\r\notherwise allied to the _ Neuroptera._ This structure, as Dr. Dawson\r\nobserves, if rightly interpreted by Mr. Scudder, introduces us to the\r\nsounds of the Devonian woods, bringing before our imagination the trill\r\nand hum of insect life that enlivened the solitudes of these strange\r\nold forests.\r\n\r\n [1] Siluria, 4th ed., p. 265.\r\n\r\n [2] Siluria, 4th ed., p. 258.\r\n\r\n [3] Abridged from _crossotos,_ a fringe, and _ pteryx,_ a fin.\r\n\r\n [4] Powrie, Geol.

For these strata Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison first proposed the name of Silurian when he had\r\nstudied and classified them in that part of Wales and some of the\r\ncontiguous counties of England which once constituted the kingdom of\r\nthe _Silures,_ a tribe of ancient Britons. The following table will\r\nexplain the two principal divisions, Upper and Lower, of the Silurian\r\nrocks, and the minor subdivisions usually adopted, comprehending all\r\nthe strata originally embraced in the Silurian system by Sir Roderick\r\nMurchison. The formations below the Arenig or Stiper-stones group are\r\ntreated of in the next chapter, when the “Primordial” or Cambrian group\r\nis described.\r\n\r\nUPPER SILURIAN ROCKS.

Ludlow Formation.—This member of the Upper Silurian group, as will\r\nbe seen by above table, is of great thickness, and subdivided into two\r\nparts—the Upper Ludlow and the Lower Ludlow. Each of these may be\r\ndistinguished near the town of Ludlow, and at other places in\r\nShropshire and Herefordshire, by peculiar organic remains; but out of\r\nmore than 500 species found in the Ludlow formation as a whole, not\r\nmore than five species per hundred are common to the overlying\r\nDevonian. The student may refer to the excellent tables given in the\r\nlast edition of Sir R. Murchison’s Siluria for a list of the organic\r\nremains of all classes distributed through the different subdivisions\r\nof the Upper and Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n_a._ Upper Ludlow: _Downton Sandstone._—At the top of this subdivision\r\nthere occur beds of fine-grained yellowish sandstone and hard reddish\r\ngrits which were formerly referred by Sir R. Murchison to the Old Red\r\nSandstone, under the name of “Tilestones.” In mineral character this\r\ngroup forms a transition from the Silurian to the Old Red Sandstone,\r\nthe strata of both being conformable; but it is now ascertained that\r\nthe fossils agree in great part specifically, and in general character\r\nentirely, with those of the underlying Upper Ludlow rocks. Among these\r\nare _Orthoceras bullatum, Platyschisma helicites, Bellerophon\r\ntrilobatus, Chonetes lata,_ etc., with numerous defenses of fishes.\r\n\r\nThese beds, therefore, now generally called the “Downton Sandstone,”\r\nare classed as the newest member of the Upper Silurian. They are well\r\nseen at Downton Castle, near Ludlow, where they are quarried for\r\nbuilding, and at Kington, in Herefordshire. In the latter place, as\r\nwell as at Ludlow, crustaceans of the genera Pterygotus (for genus see\r\nFig. 504) and Eurypterus are met with.\r\n\r\n_Bone-bed of the Upper Ludlow._—At the base of the Downton sandstones\r\nthere occurs a bone-bed which deserves especial notice as affording the\r\nmost ancient example of fossil fish occurring in any considerable\r\nquantity. It usually consists of one or two thin layers of brown bony\r\nfragments near the junction of the Old Red Sandstone and the Ludlow\r\nrocks, and was first observed by Sir R. Murchison near the town of\r\nLudlow, where it is three or four inches thick. It has since been\r\ntraced to a distance of 45 miles from that point into Gloucestershire\r\nand other counties, and is commonly not more than an inch thick, but\r\nvaries to nearly a foot. Near Ludlow two bone-beds are observable, with\r\n14 feet of intervening strata full of Upper Ludlow fossils.[1] At that\r\npoint immediately above the upper fish-bed numerous small globular\r\nbodies have been found, which were determined by Dr. Hooker to be the\r\nsporangia of a cryptogamic land-plant, probably lycopodiaceous.\r\n\r\nFig. 524: Onchus tenuistriatus. Fig. 525: Shagreen-scales of a placoid\r\nfish, Thelodus parvidens.\r\n\r\nMost of the fish have been referred by Agassiz to his placoid order,\r\nsome of them to the genus Onchus, to which the spine (Fig. 524) and the\r\nminute scales (Fig. 525) are supposed to belong. It has been suggested,\r\nhowever, that Onchus may be one of those Acanthodian fish referred by\r\nAgassiz to his Ganoid order, which are so characteristic of the base of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone in Forfarshire, although the species of the Old\r\nRed are all different from these of the Silurian beds now under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nFig. 526: Plectrodus mirabilis.\r\nThe jaw and teeth of another predaceous genus (Fig. 526) have also been\r\ndetected, together with some specimens of _Pteraspis Ludensis._ As\r\nusual in bone-beds, the teeth and bones are, for the most part,\r\nfragmentary and rolled.\r\n\r\nFig. 527: Orthis elegantula.Fig. 528: Rhynchonella navicula.\r\n_Grey Sandstone and Mudstone, etc._—The next subdivision of the Upper\r\nLudlow consists of grey calcareous sandstone, or very commonly a\r\nmicaceous stone, decomposing into soft mud, and contains, besides the\r\nshells mentioned aon page 459, _Lingula cornea, Orthis orbicularis,_ a\r\nround variety of _O. elegantula, Modiolopsis platyphylla, Grammysia\r\ncingulata,_ all characteristic of the Upper Ludlow. The lowest or\r\nmud-stone beds contain _Rhynchonella navicula_ (Fig. 528), which is\r\ncommon to this bed and the Lower Ludlow. As usual in Palæozoic strata\r\nolder than the coal, the brachiopodous mollusca greatly outnumber the\r\nlamellibranchiate (see p. 470); but the latter are by no means\r\nunrepresented. Among other genera, for example, we observe _Avicula_\r\nand _Pterinea, Cardiola, Ctenodonta_ (sub-genus of _ Nucula_),\r\n_Orthonota, Modiolopsis,_ and _ Palæarca._\r\n\r\nSome of the Upper Ludlow sandstones are ripple-marked, thus affording\r\nevidence of gradual deposition; and the same may be said of the\r\naccompanying fine argillaceous shales, which are of great thickness,\r\nand have been provincially named “mud-stones.” In some of these shales\r\nstems of crinoidea are found in an erect position, having evidently\r\nbecome fossil on the spots where they grew at the bottom of the sea.\r\nThe facility with which these rocks, when exposed to the weather, are\r\nresolved into mud, proves that, notwithstanding their antiquity, they\r\nare nearly in the state in which they were first thrown down.\r\n\r\nFig. 529: Pentamerus Knightii.\r\n\r\n_b._ Lower Ludlow Beds.—The chief mass of this formation consists of a\r\ndark grey argillaceous shale with calcareous concretions, having a\r\nmaximum thickness of 1000 feet. In some places, and especially at\r\nAymestry, in Herefordshire, a subcrystalline and argillaceous\r\nlimestone, sometimes 50 feet thick, overlies the shale. Sir R.\r\nMurchison therefore classes this Aymestry limestone as holding an\r\nintermediate position between the Upper and Lower Ludlow, but Mr.\r\nLightbody remarks that at Mocktrie, near Leintwardine, the Lower Ludlow\r\nshales, with their characteristic fossils, occur both above and below a\r\nsimilar limestone. This limestone around Aymestry and Sedgeley is\r\ndistinguished by the abundance of _Pentamerus Knightii,_ Sowerby (Fig.\r\n529), also found in the Lower Ludlow and Wenlock shale. This genus of\r\nbrachiopoda was first found in Silurian strata, and is exclusively a\r\npalæozoic form. The name was derived from _pente,_ five, and _meros,_ a\r\npart, because both valves are divided by a central septum, making four\r\nchambers, and in one valve the septum itself contains a small chamber,\r\nmaking five. The size of these septa is enormous compared with those of\r\nany other brachiopod shell; and they must nearly have divided the\r\nanimal into two equal halves; but they are, nevertheless, of the same\r\nnature as the septa or plates which are found in the interior of _\r\nSpirifera, Terebratula,_ and many other shells of this order. Messrs.\r\nMurchison and De Verneuil discovered this species dispersed in myriads\r\nthrough a white limestone of Upper Silurian age, on the banks of the\r\nIs, on the eastern flank of the Urals in Russia, and a similar species\r\nis frequent in Sweden.\r\n\r\nFig. 530: Lingula Lewisii.\r\nThree other abundant shells in the Aymestry limestone are, first,\r\n_Lingula Lewisii_ (Fig. 530); second, _Rhynchonella Wilsoni,_ Sowerby\r\n(Fig. 531), which is also common to the Lower Ludlow and Wenlock\r\nlimestone; third, _Atrypa reticularis,_ Linn. (Fig. 532), which has a\r\nvery wide range, being found in every part of the Upper Silurian\r\nsystem, and even ranging up into the Middle Devonian series.\r\n\r\nFig. 531: Rhynchonella (Terebratula) Wilsoni.\r\n\r\nThe Aymestry Limestone contains many shells, especially brachiopoda,\r\ncorals, trilobites, and other fossils, amounting on the whole to 74\r\nspecies, all except three or four being common to the beds either above\r\nor below.\r\n\r\nFig. 532: Atrypa reticularis. The Lower Ludlow Shale contains, among\r\nother fossils, many large cephalopoda not known in newer rocks, as the\r\n_Phragmoceras_ of Broderip, and the _Lituites_ of Breynius (see Figs.\r\n533, 534). The latter is partly straight and partly convoluted in a\r\nvery flat spire. The _Orthoceras Ludense_ (Fig. 535), as well as the\r\ncephalopod last mentioned, occurs in this member of the species.\r\n\r\nFig. 533: Phragmoceras ventricosum.\r\n\r\nA species of Graptolite, _G. priodon,_ Bronn (Fig. 545), occurs\r\nplentifully in the Lower Ludlow. This fossil, referred, though somewhat\r\ndoubtfully, to a form of hydrozoid or sertularian polyp, has not yet\r\nbeen met with in strata above the Silurian.\r\n\r\nStar-fish, as Sir R. Murchison points out, are by no means rare in the\r\nLower Ludlow rock. These fossils, of which six extinct genera are now\r\nknown in the Ludlow series, represented by 18 species, remind us of\r\nvarious living forms now found in our British seas, both of the\r\nfamilies _Asteriadæ_ and _ Ophiuridæ._\r\n\r\nFig. 534: Lituites (Trochoceras) giganteus. Fig. 535: Fragment of\r\nOrthoceras Ludense.\r\n\r\nOldest known Fossil Fish.—Until 1859 there was no example of a fossil\r\nfish older than the bone-bed of the Upper Ludlow, but in that year a\r\nspecimen of Pteraspis was found at Church Hill, near Leintwardine, in\r\nShropshire, by Mr. J. E. Lee of Caerleon, F.G.S., in shale below the\r\nAymestry limestone, associated with fossil shells of the Lower Ludlow\r\nformation—shells which differ considerably from those characterising\r\nthe Upper Ludlow already described. This discovery is of no small\r\ninterest as bearing on the theory of progressive development, because,\r\naccording to Professor Huxley, the genus Pteraspis is allied to the\r\nsturgeon, and therefore by no means of low grade in the piscine class.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact well worthy of notice that no remains of vertebrata have\r\nyet been met with in any strata older than the Lower Ludlow.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the hundreds of Mollusks, Echinoderms, Trilobites,\r\nCorals, and other fossils already obtained from more ancient Silurian\r\nformations, Upper, Middle, and Lower, we may well ask whether any set\r\nof fossiliferous rocks newer in the series were ever studied with equal\r\ndiligence, and over so vast an area, without yielding a single\r\nichthyolite. Yet we must hesitate before we accept, even on such\r\nevidence, so sweeping a conclusion, as that the globe, for ages after\r\nit was inhabited by all the great classes of invertebrata, remained\r\nwholly untenanted by vertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n_Dates of the Discovery of different Classes of Fossil Vertebrata;\r\nshowing the gradual progress made in tracing them to rocks of higher\r\nantiquity._\r\n\r\n  Year Formations Geographical localities\r\n  Mammalia 1798 Upper Eocene Paris (Gypsum of Montmartre).1\r\n  1818 Lower Oolite Stonesfield.2 1847 Upper\r\n  Trias Stuttgart.3 Aves 1782 Upper Eocene Paris (Gypsum\r\n  of Montmartre).4 1839 Lower Eocene Isle of Sheppey (London\r\n  Clay).5 1854 Lower Eocene Woolwich Beds.6 1855 Lower\r\n  Eocene Mendon (Plastic Clay).7 1858 Chloritic Series, or\r\n  Upper Greensand Cambridge.8 1863 Upper\r\n  Oolite Solenhofen.9 Reptilia 1710 Permian (or\r\n  Zechstein) Thuringia.10 1844 Carboniferous Saarbrück,\r\n  near Trèves.11 Pisces 1709 Permian (or\r\n  Kupferschiefer) Thuringia.12 1793 Carboniferous (Mountain\r\n  Limestone) Glasgow.13 1828 Devonian Caithness.14\r\n  1840 Upper Ludlow Ludlow.15 1859 Lower\r\n  Ludlow Leintwardine.16\r\n\r\n1.

Wenlock Formation.—We next come to the Wenlock formation, which has\r\nbeen divided (see Table, p. 458) into Wenlock limestone, Wenlock shale,\r\nand Woolhope limestone and Denbighshire grits.\r\n\r\nFig. 536: Halysites catenularius.\r\n\r\n_a. Wenlock Limestone._—This limestone, otherwise well known to\r\ncollectors by the name of the Dudley Limestone, forms a continuous\r\nridge in Shropshire, ranging for about 20 miles from S.W. to N.E.,\r\nabout a mile distant from the nearly parallel escarpment of the\r\nAymestry limestone. This ridgy prominence is due to the solidity of the\r\nrock, and to the softness of the shales above and below it. Near\r\nWenlock it consists of thick masses of grey subcrystalline limestone,\r\nreplete with corals, encrinites, and trilobites. It is essentially of a\r\nconcretionary nature; and the concretions, termed “ball-stones” in\r\nShropshire, are often enormous, even 80 feet in diameter. They are of\r\npure carbonate of lime, the surrounding rock being more or less\r\nargillaceous[2] Sometimes in the Malvern Hills this limestone,\r\naccording to Professor Phillips, is oolitic.\r\n\r\nFig. 537: Favosites Gothlandica.\r\nAmong the corals, in which this formation is so rich, 53 species being\r\nknown, the “chain-coral,” _Halysites catenularius_ (Fig. 536), may be\r\npointed out as one very easily recognised, and widely spread in Europe,\r\nranging through all parts of the Silurian group, from the Aymestry\r\nlimestone to near the bottom of the Llandeilo rocks. Another coral, the\r\n_Favosites Gothlandica_ (Fig. 537), is also met with in profusion in\r\nlarge hemispherical masses, which break up into columnar and prismatic\r\nfragments, like that here figured (Fig. 537, _b_). Another common form\r\nin the Wenlock limestone is the _Omphyma turbinatum_ (Fig. 538), which,\r\nlike many of its modern companions, reminds us of some cup-corals; but\r\nall the Silurian genera belong to the palæozoic type before mentioned\r\n(p. 432), exhibiting the quadripartite arrangement of the septalamellæ\r\nwithin the cup.\r\n\r\nFig. 538: Omphyma turbinatum.Fig. 539: Pseudocrinites bifasciatus.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous Crinoids, several peculiar species of _\r\nCyathocrinus_ (for genus see Figs. 478, 479) contribute their\r\ncalcareous stems, arms, and cups towards the composition of the Wenlock\r\nlimestone. Of Cystideans there are a few very remarkable forms, most of\r\nthem peculiar to the Upper Silurian formation, as, for example, the _\r\nPseudocrinites,_ which was furnished with pinnated fixed arms,[3] as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 539.\r\n\r\nFig. 540: Strophomena (Leptæna) depressa.\r\nThe Brachiopoda are, many of them, of the same species as those of the\r\nAymestry limestone; as, for example, _Atrypa reticularis_ (Fig. 532),\r\nand _Strophomena depressa_ (Fig. 540); but the latter species ranges\r\nalso from the Ludlow rocks, through the Wenlock shale, to the Caradoc\r\nSandstone.\r\n\r\nFig. 541: Calymene Blumenbachii.\r\nThe crustaceans are represented almost exclusively by Trilobites, which\r\nare very conspicuous, 22 being peculiar. The _ Calymene Blumenbachii_\r\n(Fig. 541), called the ”Dudley Trilobite,” was known to collectors long\r\nbefore its true place in the animal kingdom was ascertained. It is\r\noften found coiled up like the common _Oniscus_ or wood-louse, and this\r\nis so usual a circumstance among certain genera of trilobites as to\r\nlead us to conclude that they must have habitually resorted to this\r\nmode of protecting themselves when alarmed. The other common species is\r\nthe _Phacops caudatus (Asaphus caudatus),_ Brong. (see Fig. 542), and\r\nthis is conspicuous for its large size and flattened form.\r\n_Sphærexochus mirus_ (Fig. 543) is almost a globe when rolled up, the\r\nforehead or glabellum of this species being extremely inflated. The\r\n_Homalonotus,_ a form of Trilobite in which the tripartite division of\r\nthe dorsal crust is almost lost (see Fig. 544), is very characteristic\r\nof this division of the Silurian series.\r\n\r\nFig. 542: Phacops (Asaphus) caudatus.Fig. 543: Sphærexochus mirus.\r\n_Wenlock Shale._—This, observes Sir R. Murchison, is infinitely the\r\nlargest and most persistent member of the Wenlock formation, for the\r\nlimestone often thins out and disappears. The shale, like the Lower\r\nLudlow, often contains elliptical concretions of impure earthy\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nFig. 544: Homalonotus delphinocephalus.\r\nIn the Malvern district it is a mass of finely levigated argillaceous\r\nmatter, attaining, according to Professor Phillips, a thickness of 640\r\nfeet, but it is sometimes more than 1000 feet thick in Wales, and is\r\nworked for flag-stones and slates. The prevailing fossils, besides\r\ncorals and trilobites, and some crinoids, are several small species of\r\n_Orthis, Cardiola,_ and numerous thin-shelled species of\r\n_Orthoceratites._\r\n\r\nAbout six species of _Graptolite,_ a peculiar group of sertularian\r\nfossils before alluded to (p. 463) as being confined to Silurian rocks,\r\noccur in this shale. Of fossils of this genus, which is very\r\ncharacteristic of the Lower Silurian, I shall again speak in the sequel\r\n(p. 474).\r\n\r\nFig. 545: Graptolithus priodon.\r\n_b. Woolhope Beds._—Though not always recognised as a separate\r\nsubdivision of the Wenlock, the Woolhope beds, which underlie the\r\nWenlock shale, are of great importance. Usually they occur as massive\r\nor nodular limestones, underlaid by a fine shale or flag-stone; and in\r\nother cases, as in the noted Denbighshire sandstones, as a coarse grit\r\nof very great thickness. This grit forms mountain ranges through North\r\nand South Wales, and is generally marked by the great sterility of the\r\nsoil where it occurs. It contains the usual Wenlock fossils, but with\r\nthe addition of some common in the uppermost Ludlow rock, such as _\r\nChonetes lata_ and _Bellerophon trilobatus._ The chief fossils of the\r\nWoolhope limestone are _Illænus Barriensis, Homalonotus\r\ndelphinocephalus_ (Fig. 544), _Strophomena imbrex,_ and _Rhynchonella\r\nWilsoni_ (Fig. 531). The latter attains in the Woolhope beds an unusual\r\nsize for the species, the specimens being sometimes twice as large as\r\nthose found in the Wenlock limestone.\r\n\r\nIn some places below the Wenlock formation there are shales of a pale\r\nor purple colour, which near Tarannon attain a thickness of about 1000\r\nfeet; they can be traced through Radnor and Montgomery to North Wales,\r\naccording to Messrs. Jukes and Aveline. By the latter geologist they\r\nhave been identified with certain shales above the May-Hill Sandstone,\r\nnear Llandovery, but, owing to the extreme scarcity of fossils, their\r\nexact position remains doubtful.\r\n\r\n3. Llandovery Group—Beds of Passage.—We now come to beds respecting the\r\nclassification of which there has been much difference of opinion, and\r\nwhich in fact must be considered as beds of passage between Upper and\r\nLower Silurian. I formerly adopted the plan of those who class them as\r\nMiddle Silurian, but they are scarcely entitled to this distinction,\r\nsince after about 1400 Silurian species have been compared the number\r\npeculiar to the group in question only gives them an importance equal\r\nto such minor subdivisions as the Ludlow or Bala groups. I therefore\r\nprefer to regard them as the base of the Upper Silurian, to which group\r\nthey are linked by more than twice as many species as to the Lower\r\nSilurian. By this arrangement the line of demarkation between the two\r\ngreat divisions, though confessedly arbitrary, is less so than by any\r\nother. They are called Llandovery Rocks, from a town in South Wales, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of which they are well developed, and where,\r\nespecially at a hill called Noeth Grug, in spite of several faults,\r\ntheir relations to one another can be clearly seen.\r\n\r\n_a.  Upper Llandovery or May-Hill Sandstone._—The May-Hill group, which\r\nhas also been named ”Upper Llandovery,” by Sir R. Murchison, ranges\r\nfrom the west of the Longmynd to Builth, Llandovery, and Llandeilo, and\r\nto the sea in Marlow’s Bay, where it is seen in the cliffs. It consists\r\nof brownish and yellow sandstones with calcareous nodules, having\r\nsometimes a conglomerate at the base derived from the waste of the\r\nLower Silurian rocks. These May-Hill beds were formerly supposed to be\r\npart of the Caradoc formation, but their true position was determined\r\nby Professor Sedgwick[4] to be at the base of the Upper Silurian\r\nproper. The more calcareous portions of the rock have been called the\r\nPentamerus limestone, because _Pentamerus oblongus_ (Fig. 546) is very\r\nabundant in them. It is usually accompanied by _P. (Stricklandinia)\r\nlirata_ (Fig. 547); both forms have a wide geographical range, being\r\nalso met with in the same part of the Silurian series in Russia and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nFig. 546: Pentamerus oblongus.\r\nAbout 228 species of fossils are known in the May-Hill division, more\r\nthan half of which are Wenlock species. They consist of trilobites of\r\nthe genera _Illænus_ and _Calymene_; Brachiopods of the genera _Orthis,\r\nAtrypa, Leptæna, Pentamerus, Strophomena,_ and others; Gasteropods of\r\nthe genera _Turbo, Murchisonia_ (for genus, see Fig. 567), and\r\n_Bellerophon_; and Pteropods of the genus _Conularia._ The Brachiopods,\r\nof which there are 66 species, are almost all Upper Silurian.\r\n\r\nFig. 547: Stricklandinia (Pentamerus) lirata. Fig. 548: Tentaculites\r\nannulatus.\r\nAmong the fossils of the May-Hill shelly sandstone at Malvern,\r\n_Tentaculites annulatus_ (Fig. 548), an annelid, probably allied to\r\nSerpula, is found.\r\n\r\n_Lower Llandovery Rocks._—Below the May-Hill Group are the Lower\r\nLlandovery Rocks, which consist chiefly of hard slaty rocks, and beds\r\nof conglomerate from 600 to 1000 feet in thickness. The fossils, which\r\nare somewhat rare in the lower beds, consist of 128 known species, only\r\neleven of which are peculiar, 83 being common to the May-Hill group\r\nabove, and 93 common to the rocks below. _Stricklandinia (Pentamerus)\r\nlevis,_ which is common in the Lower Llandovery, becomes rare in the\r\nUpper, while _ Pentamerus oblongus_ (Fig. 546), which is the\r\ncharacteristic shell of the Upper Llandovery, occurs but seldom in the\r\nLower.\r\n\r\nLOWER SILURIAN ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Silurian has been divided into, first, the Bala Group;\r\nsecond, the Llandeilo flags; and, third, the Arenig or Lower Llandeilo\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nBala and Caradoc Beds.—The Caradoc sandstone was originally so named by\r\nSir R. I. Murchison from the mountain called Caer Caradoc, in\r\nShropshire; it consists of shelly sandstones of great thickness, and\r\nsometimes containing much calcareous matter. The rock is frequently\r\nladen with the beautiful trilobite called by Murchison _Trinucleus\r\nCaractaci_ (see Fig. 553), which ranges from the base to the summit of\r\nthe formation, usually accompanied by _Strophomena grandis_ (see Fig.\r\n551), and _Orthis vespertilio_ (Fig. 550), with many other fossils.\r\n\r\nFig. 549: Orthis tricenaria. Fig. 550: Orthis vespertilio. Fig. 551:\r\nOrthis (Strophomena) grandis.\r\n\r\n_Brachiopoda._—Nothing is more remarkable in these beds, and in the\r\nSilurian strata generally of all countries, than the preponderance of\r\nbrachiopoda over other forms of mollusca. Their proportional numbers\r\ncan by no means be explained by supposing them to have inhabited seas\r\nof great depth, for the contrast between the palæozoic and the present\r\nstate of things has not been essentially altered by the late\r\ndiscoveries made in our deep-sea dredgings. We find the living\r\nbrachiopoda so rare as to form about one forty-fourth of the whole\r\nbivalve fauna, whereas in the Lower Silurian rocks of which we are now\r\nabout to treat, and where the brachiopoda reach their maximum, they are\r\nrepresented by more than twice as many species as the Lamellibranchiate\r\nbivalves.\r\n\r\nThere may, indeed, be said to be a continued decrease of the\r\nproportional number of this lower tribe of mollusca as we proceed from\r\nolder to newer rocks. In the British Devonian, for example, the\r\nBrachiopoda number 99, the Lamellibranchiata 58; while in the\r\nCarboniferous their proportions are more than reversed, the\r\nLamellibranchiata numbering 334 species, and the Brachiopoda only 157.\r\nIn the Secondary or Cainozoic formations the preponderance of the\r\nhigher grade of bivalves becomes more and more marked, till in the\r\ntertiary strata it approaches that observed in the living creation.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, it may be useful to the student to know that a\r\nBrachiopod differs from ordinary bivalves, mussels, cockles, etc., in\r\nbeing always equal-sided and never quite equi-valved; the form of each\r\nvalve being symmetrical, it may be divided into two equal parts by a\r\nline drawn from the apex to the centre of the margin.\r\n\r\n_Trilobites._—In the Bala and Caradoc beds the trilobites reach their\r\nmaximum, being represented by 111 species referred to 23 genera.\r\n\r\nBurmeister, in his work on the organisation of trilobites, supposes\r\nthat they swam at the surface of the water in the open sea and near\r\ncoasts, feeding on smaller marine animals, and to have had the power of\r\nrolling themselves into a ball as a defence against injury. He was also\r\nof opinion that they underwent various transformations analogous to\r\nthose of living crustaceans. M. Barrande, author of an admirable work\r\non the Silurian rocks of Bohemia, confirms the doctrine of their\r\nmetamorphosis, having traced more than twenty species through different\r\nstages of growth from the young state just after its escape from the\r\negg to the adult form. He has followed some of them from a point in\r\nwhich they show no eyes, no joints, or body rings, and no distinct\r\ntail, up to the complete form with the full number of segments. This\r\nchange is brought about before the animal has attained a tenth part of\r\nits full dimensions, and hence such minute and delicate specimens are\r\nrarely met with. Some of his figures of the metamorphoses of the common\r\n_Trinucleus_ are copied in Figs. 552 and 553. It was not till 1870 that\r\nMr. Billings was enabled, by means of a specimen found in Canada, to\r\nprove that the trilobite was provided with eight legs.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained that a great thickness of slaty and crystalline\r\nrocks of South Wales, as well as those of Snowdon and Bala, in North\r\nWales, which were first supposed to be of older date than the Silurian\r\nsandstones and mudstones of Shropshire, are in fact identical in age,\r\nand contain the same organic remains. At Bala, in Merionethshire, a\r\nlimestone rich in fossils occurs, in which two genera of star-fish,\r\n_Protaster_ and _Palæaster,_ are found; the fossil specimen of the\r\nlatter (Fig. 554) being almost as uncompressed as if found just washed\r\nup on the sea-beach. Besides the star-fish there occur abundance of\r\nthose peculiar bodies called _Cystideæ._ They are the _Sphæronites_ of\r\nold authors, and were considered by Professor E. Forbes as intermediate\r\nbetween the crinoids and echinoderms. The _Echinosphæronite_ here\r\nrepresented (Fig. 555) is characteristic of the Caradoc beds in Wales,\r\nand of their equivalents in Sweden and Russia.\r\n\r\nFig. 552: Young individuals of Trinucleus concentricus. Fig. 553:\r\nTrinucleus concentricus.\r\n\r\nFig. 554: Palæaster asperimus.\r\nFig. 555: Echinosphæronites ballicus.\r\nWith it have been found several other genera of the same family, such\r\nas _Sphæronites, Hemicosmites,_ etc. Among the mollusca are Pteropods\r\nof the genus _Conularia_ of large size (for genus, see Fig. 518). About\r\neleven species of Graptolite are reckoned as belonging to this\r\nformation; they are chiefly found in peculiar localities where black\r\nmud abounded. The formation, when traced into South Wales and Ireland,\r\nassumes a greatly altered mineral aspect, but still retains its\r\ncharacteristic fossils. The known fauna of the Bala group comprises 565\r\nspecies, 352 of which are peculiar, and 93, as before stated, are\r\ncommon to the overlying Llandovery rocks. It is worthy of remark that,\r\nwhen it occurs under the form of trappean tuff (volcanic ashes of De la\r\nBeche), as in the crest of Snowdon, the peculiar species which\r\ndistinguish it from the Llandeilo beds are still observable. The\r\nformation generally appears to be of shallow-water origin, and in that\r\nrespect is contrasted with the group next to be described. Professor\r\nRamsay estimates the thickness of the Bala Beds, including the\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic rocks, stratified and unstratified, as being\r\nfrom 10,000 to 12,000 feet.\r\n\r\nFig. 556: Didymograpsus (Graptolites) Murchisonii.\r\nLlandeilo Flags.—The Lower Silurian strata were originally divided by\r\nSir R. Murchison into the upper group already described, under the name\r\nof Caradoc Sandstone, and a lower one, called, from a town in\r\nCarmarthenshire, the _Llandeilo_ flags. The last mentioned strata\r\nconsist of dark-coloured micaceous flags, frequently calcareous, with a\r\ngreat thickness of shales, generally black, below them. The same beds\r\nare also seen at Builth, in Radnorshire, where they are interstratified\r\nwith volcanic matter.\r\n\r\nA still lower part of the Llandeilo rocks consists of a black\r\ncarbonaceous slate of great thickness, frequently containing sulphate\r\nof alumina, and sometimes, as in Dumfriesshire, beds of anthracite. It\r\nhas been conjectured that this carbonaceous matter may be due in great\r\nmeasure to large quantities of imbedded animal remains, for the number\r\nof Graptolites included in these slates was certainly very great. In\r\nGreat Britain eleven genera and about 40 species of Graptolites occur\r\nin the Llandeilo flags and underlying Arenig beds. The double\r\nGraptolites, or those with two rows of cells, such as Diplograpsus\r\n(Fig. 557), are conspicuous.\r\n\r\nFig. 557: Diplograpsus pristis. Fig. 558: Rastrites peregrinus.\r\n\r\nFig. 559: Diplograpsus folium.\r\nThe brachiopoda of the Llandeilo flags, which number 47 species, are in\r\nthe main the same as those of the Caradoc Sandstone, but the other\r\nmollusca are in great part of different species.\r\n\r\nIn Europe generally, as, for example, in Sweden and Russia, no shells\r\nare so characteristic of this formation as Orthoceratites, usually of\r\ngreat size, and with a wide siphuncle placed on one side instead of\r\nbeing central (see Fig. 560).\r\n\r\nFig. 560: Orthoceras duplex.\r\n\r\nAmong other Cephalopods in the Llandeilo flags is Cyrtoceras; in the\r\nsame beds also are found Bellerophon (see Fig. 488) and some Pteropod\r\nshells (_Conularia, Theca,_ etc.), also in spots where sand abounded,\r\nlamellibranchiate bivalves of large size. The Crustaceans were\r\nplentifully represented by the Trilobites, which appear to have swarmed\r\nin the Silurian seas just as crabs and shrimps do in our own; no less\r\nthan 263 species have been found in the British Silurian fauna. The\r\ngenera _Asaphus_ (Fig. 561), _Ogygia_ (Fig. 562), and _Trinucleus_\r\n(Figs. 552 and 553) form a marked feature of the rich and varied\r\nTrilobitic fauna of this age.\r\n\r\nFig. 561: Asaphus tyrannus. Fig. 562: Ogygia Buchii.\r\n\r\nBeneath the black slates above described of the Llandeilo formation,\r\nGraptolites are still found in great variety and abundance, and the\r\ncharacteristic genera of shells and trilobites of the Lower Silurian\r\nrocks are still traceable downward, in Shropshire, Cumberland, and\r\nNorth and South Wales, through a vast depth of shaly beds, in some\r\ndistricts interstratified with trappean formations of contemporaneous\r\norigin; these consist of tuffs and lavas, the tuffs being formed of\r\nsuch materials as are ejected from craters and deposited immediately on\r\nthe bed of the ocean, or washed into it from the land. According to\r\nProfessor Ramsay, their thickness is about 3300 feet in North Wales,\r\nincluding those of the Lower Llandeilo. The lavas are feldspathic, and\r\nof porphyritic structure, and, according to the same authority, of an\r\naggregate thickness of 2500 feet.\r\n\r\nFig. 563: Arenicolites linearis.\r\nArenig or Stiper-Stones Group _(Lower Llandeilo of Murchison)._—Next in\r\nthe descending order are the shales and sandstones in which the\r\nquartzose rocks called Stiper-Stones in Shropshire occur. Originally\r\nthese Stiper-Stones were only known as arenaceous quartzose strata in\r\nwhich no organic remains were conspicuous, except the tubular burrows\r\nof annelids (see Fig. 563, _Arenicolites linearis_), which are\r\nremarkably common in the Lowest Silurian in Shropshire, and in the\r\nState of New York, in America. They have already been alluded to as\r\noccurring by thousands in the Silurian strata unconformably overlying\r\nthe Cambrian, in the mountain of Queenaig, in Sutherlandshire (Fig.\r\n82). I have seen similar burrows now made on the retiring of the tides\r\nin the sands of the Bristol Channel, near Minehead, by lob-worms which\r\nare dug out by fishermen and used as bait. When the term Silurian was\r\ngiven by Sir R. Murchison, in 1835, to the whole series, he considered\r\nthe Stiper-Stones as the base of the Silurian system, but no fossil\r\nfauna had then been obtained, such as could alone enable the geologist\r\nto draw a line between this member of the series and the Llandeilo\r\nflags above, or a vast thickness of rock below, which was seen to form\r\nthe Longmynd hills, and was called ”unfossiliferous graywacke.”\r\nProfessor Sedgwick had described, in 1843, strata now ascertained to be\r\nof the same age as largely developed in the Arenig mountain, in\r\nMerionethshire; and the Skiddaw slates in the Lake-District of\r\nCumberland, studied by the same author, were of corresponding date,\r\nthough the number of fossils was, in both cases, too few for the\r\ndetermination of their true chronological relations. The subsequent\r\nresearches of Messrs. Sedgwick and Harkness, in Cumberland, and of Sir\r\nR. I. Murchison and the Government surveyors in Shropshire, have\r\nincreased the species to more than sixty. These were examined by Mr.\r\nSalter, and shown in the third edition of ”Siluria” (p. 52, 1859) to be\r\nquite distinct from the fossils of the overlying Llandeilo flags. Among\r\nthese the _Obolella plumbea, Æglina binodosa, Ogygia Selwynii,_ and\r\n_Didymograpsus geminus_ (Fig. 564), and _D. Hirundo,_ are\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nFig. 564: Didymograpsus geminus.\r\n\r\nBut, although the species are distinct, the genera are the same as\r\nthose which characterise the Silurian rocks above, and none of the\r\ncharacteristic primordial or Cambrian forms, presently to be mentioned,\r\nare intermixed. The same may be said of a set of beds underlying the\r\nArenig rocks at Ramsay Island and other places in the neighbourhood of\r\nSt. David’s. These beds, which have only lately become known to us\r\nthrough the labours of Dr. Hicks,[5] present already twenty new\r\nspecies, the greater part of them allied generically to the Arenig\r\nrocks. This Arenig group may therefore be conveniently regarded as the\r\nbase of the great Silurian system, a system which, by the thickness of\r\nits strata and the changes in animal life of which it contains the\r\nrecord, is more than equal in value to the Devonian, or Carboniferous,\r\nor other principal divisions, whether of primary or secondary date.\r\n\r\nIt would be unsafe to rely on the mere thickness of the strata,\r\nconsidered apart from the great fluctuations in organic life which took\r\nplace between the era of the Llandeilo and that of the Ludlow\r\nformation, especially as the enormous pile of Silurian rocks observed\r\nin Great Britain (in Wales more particularly) is derived in great part\r\nfrom igneous action, and is not confined to the ordinary deposition of\r\nsediment from rivers or the waste of cliffs.\r\n\r\nIn volcanic archipelagoes, such as the Canaries, we see the most active\r\nof all known causes, aqueous and igneous, simultaneously at work to\r\nproduce great results in a comparatively moderate lapse of time. The\r\noutpouring of repeated streams of lava—the showering down upon land and\r\nsea of volcanic ashes—the sweeping seaward of loose sand and cinders,\r\nor of rocks ground down to pebbles and sand, by rivers and torrents\r\ndescending steeply inclined channels—the undermining and eating away of\r\nlong lines of sea-cliff exposed to the swell of a deep and open\r\nocean—these operations combine to produce a considerable volume of\r\nsuperimposed matter, without there being time for any extensive change\r\nof species. Nevertheless, there would seem to be a limit to the\r\nthickness of stony masses formed even under such favourable\r\ncircumstances, for the analogy of tertiary volcanic regions lends no\r\ncountenance to the notion that sedimentary and igneous rocks 25,000,\r\nmuch less 45,000 feet thick, like those of Wales, could originate while\r\none and the same fauna should continue to people the earth. If, then,\r\nwe allow that about 25,000 feet of matter may be ascribed to one\r\nsystem, such as the Silurian, as above described, we may be prepared to\r\ndiscover in the next series of subjacent rocks a distinct assemblage of\r\nspecies, or even in great part of genera, of organic remains. Such\r\nappears to be the fact, and I shall therefore conclude with the Arenig\r\nbeds my enumeration of the Silurian formations in Great Britain, and\r\nproceed to say something of their foreign equivalents, before treating\r\nof rocks older than the Silurian.\r\n\r\nSilurian Strata of the Continent of Europe.—When we turn to the\r\ncontinent of Europe, we discover the same ancient series occupying a\r\nwide area, but in no region as yet has it been observed to attain great\r\nthickness. Thus, in Norway and Sweden, the total thickness of strata of\r\nSilurian age is considerably less than 1000 feet, although the\r\nrepresentatives both of the Upper and Lower Silurian of England are not\r\nwanting there. In Russia the Silurian strata, so far as they are yet\r\nknown, seem to be even of smaller vertical dimensions than in\r\nScandinavia, and they appear to consist chiefly of the Llandovery\r\ngroup, or of a limestone containing _ Pentamerus oblongus,_ below which\r\nare strata with fossils corresponding to those of the Llandeilo beds of\r\nEngland. The lowest rock with organic remains yet discovered is ”the\r\nUngulite or Obolus grit” of St. Petersburg, probably coeval with the\r\nLlandeilo flags of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe shales and grits near St. Petersburg, above alluded to, contain\r\ngreen grains in their sandy layers, and are in a singularly unaltered\r\nstate, taking into account their high antiquity. The prevailing\r\nBrachiopods consist of the _Obolus_ _Shells of the lowest known\r\nFossiliferous Beds in Russia._\r\n\r\nFig. 565: Siphonotreta unguiculata. Fig. 566: Obolus Apollinis.\r\n\r\nor Ungulite of Pander, and a _Siphonotreta_ (Figs. 565, 566).\r\nNotwithstanding the antiquity of this Russian formation, it should be\r\nstated that both of these genera of brachiopods have been also found in\r\nthe Upper Silurian of England, i.e., in the Wenlock limestone.\r\n\r\nAmong the green grains of the sandy strata above-mentioned, Professor\r\nEhrenberg announced in 1854 his discovery of remains of foraminifera.\r\nThese are casts of the cells; and among five or six forms three are\r\nconsidered by him as referable to existing genera (e.g., _Textularia,\r\nRotalia,_ and _Guttulina_).\r\n\r\nSilurian Strata of the United States.—The Silurian formations can be\r\nadvantageously studied in the States of New York, Ohio, and other\r\nregions north and south of the great Canadian lakes. Here they are\r\noften found, as in Russia, nearly in horizontal position, and are more\r\nrich in well-preserved fossils than in almost any spot in Europe. In\r\nthe State of New York, where the succession of the beds and their\r\nfossils have been most carefully worked out by the Government\r\nsurveyors, the subdivisions given in the first column of the table\r\nbelow have been adopted.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions of the Silurian Strata of New York.\r\n(Strata below the Oriskany sandstone or base of the Devonian.)_\r\n\r\nNew York Names British equivalents 1.

Calciferous Sandstone Lower Silurian (or Caradoc and Bala,\r\nLlandeilo and Arenig Formations).\r\n\r\nIn the second column of the same table I have added the supposed\r\nBritish equivalents. All Palæontologists, European and American, such\r\nas MM. De Verneuil, D. Sharpe, Professor Hall, E. Billings, and others,\r\nwho have entered upon this comparison, admit that there is a marked\r\ngeneral correspondence in the succession of fossil forms, and even\r\nspecies, as we trace the organic remains downward from the highest to\r\nthe lowest beds; but it is impossible to parallel each minor\r\nsubdivision.\r\n\r\nThat the Niagara Limestone, over which the river of that name is\r\nprecipitated at the great cataract, together with its underlying\r\nshales, corresponds to the Wenlock limestone and shale of England there\r\ncan be no doubt. Among the species common to this formation in America\r\nand Europe are _Calymene Blumenbachii, Homalonotus delphinocephalus_\r\n(Fig. 544), with several other trilobites; _Rhynchonella Wilsoni,_ Fig.\r\n531, and _Retzia cuneata; Orthis elegantula, Pentamerus galeatus,_ with\r\nmany more brachiopods; _Orthoceras annulatum,_ among the cephalopodous\r\nshells; and _Favosites gothlandica,_ with other large corals.\r\n\r\nFig. 567: Murchisonia gracilis.\r\nThe Clinton Group, containing _Pentamerus oblongus_ and _\r\nStricklandinia,_ and related more nearly by its fossil species with the\r\nbeds above than with those below, is the equivalent of the Llandovery\r\nGroup or beds of passage.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson River Group, and the Trenton Limestone, agree\r\npalæontologically with the Caradoc or Bala group, containing in common\r\nwith them several species of trilobites, such as _ Asaphus (Isotelus)\r\ngigas, Trinucleus concentricus_ (Fig. 553); and various shells, such as\r\n_ Orthis striatula, Orthis biforata_ (or _O. lynx_), _O. porcata_ (_O.\r\noccidentalis_ of Hall), and _Bellerophon bilobatus._ In the Trenton\r\nlimestone occurs _Murchisonia gracilis,_ Fig. 567, a fossil also common\r\nto the Llandeilo beds in England.\r\n\r\nMr. D. Sharpe, in his report on the mollusca collected by me from these\r\nstrata in North America,[6] has concluded that the number of species\r\ncommon to the Silurian rocks on both sides of the Atlantic is between\r\n30 and 40 per cent; a result which, although no doubt liable to future\r\nmodification, when a larger comparison shall have been made, proves,\r\nnevertheless, that many of the species had a wide geographical range.\r\nIt seems that comparatively few of the gasteropods and\r\nlamellibranchiate bivalves of North America can be identified\r\nspecifically with European fossils, while no less than two-fifths of\r\nthe brachiopoda, of which my collection chiefly consisted, are the\r\nsame. In explanation of these facts, it is suggested that most of the\r\nrecent brachiopoda (especially the orthidiform ones) are inhabitants of\r\ndeep water, and that they may have had a wider geographical range than\r\nshells living near shore. The predominance of bivalve mollusca of this\r\npeculiar class has caused the Silurian period to be sometimes styled\r\n”the age of brachiopods.”\r\n\r\nIn Canada, as in the State of New York, the Potsdam Sandstone underlies\r\nthe above-mentioned calcareous rocks, but contains a different suite of\r\nfossils, as will be hereafter explained. In parts of the globe still\r\nmore remote from Europe the Silurian strata have also been recognised,\r\nas in South America, Australia, and India. In all these regions the\r\nfacies of the fauna, or the types of organic life, enable us to\r\nrecognise the contemporaneous origin of the rocks; but the fossil\r\nspecies are distinct, showing that the old notion of a universal\r\ndiffusion throughout the ”primæval seas” of one uniform specific fauna\r\nwas quite unfounded, geographical provinces having evidently existed in\r\nthe oldest as in the most modern times.\r\n\r\n [1] Murchison’s Siluria, p. 140.\r\n\r\n [2] Murchison’s Siluria, chap. vi.\r\n\r\n [3] E.

I. Murchison was exploring in 1833, in Shropshire and the\r\nborders of Wales, the strata which in 1835 he first called Silurian,\r\nProfessor Sedgwick was surveying the rocks of North Wales, which both\r\nthese geologists considered at that period as of older date, and for\r\nwhich in 1836 Sedgwick proposed the name of Cambrian. It was afterwards\r\nfound that a large portion of the slaty rocks of North Wales, which had\r\nbeen considered as more ancient than the Llandeilo beds and\r\nStiper-Stones before alluded to, were, in reality, not inferior in\r\nposition to those Lower Silurian beds of Murchison, but merely\r\nextensive undulations of the same, bearing fossils identical in\r\nspecies, though these were generally rarer and less perfectly\r\npreserved, owing to the changes which the rocks had undergone from\r\nmetamorphic action. To such rocks the term “Cambrian” was no longer\r\napplicable, although it continued to be appropriate to strata inferior\r\nto the Stiper-Stones, and which were older than those of the Lower\r\nSilurian group as originally defined. It was not till 1846 that fossils\r\nwere found in Wales in the Lingula flags, the place of which will be\r\nseen in the table below. By this time Barrande had already published an\r\naccount of a rich collection of fossils which he had discovered in\r\nBohemia, portions of which he recognised as of corresponding age with\r\nMurchison’s Upper and Lower Silurian, while others were more ancient,\r\nto which he gave the name of “Primordial,” for the fossils were\r\nsufficiently distinct to entitle the rocks to be referred to a new\r\nperiod. They consisted chiefly of trilobites of genera distinct from\r\nthose occurring in the overlying Silurian formations. These peculiar\r\ngenera were afterwards found in rocks holding a corresponding position\r\nin Wales, and I shall retain for them the term Cambrian, as recent\r\ndiscoveries in our own country seem to carry the first fauna of\r\nBarrande, or his primordial type, even into older strata than any which\r\nhe found to be fossiliferous in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe term primordial was intended to express M. Barrande’s own belief\r\nthat the fossils of the rocks so-called afforded evidence of the first\r\nappearance of vital phenomena on this planet, and that consequently no\r\nfossiliferous strata of older date would or could ever be discovered.\r\nThe acceptance of such a nomenclature would seem to imply that we\r\ndespaired of extending our discoveries of new and more ancient fossil\r\ngroups at some future day when vast portions of the globe, hitherto\r\nunexplored, should have been thoroughly surveyed. Already the discovery\r\nof the Laurentian Eozoon in Canada, presently to be mentioned,\r\ndiscountenances such views.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the succession of the strata in England\r\nand Wales which belong to the Cambrian group or the fossiliferous rocks\r\nolder than the Arenig or Lower Llandeilo rocks:\r\n\r\nUPPER CAMBRIAN TREMADOC SLATES _(Primordial of Barrande in part)_\r\nLINGULA FLAGS _(Primordial of Barrande)_ LOWER CAMBRIAN MENEVIAN\r\nBEDS _(Primordial of Barrande)_ LONGMYND GROUP _a._ Harlech Grits\r\n_b._ Llanberis Slates\r\n\r\nTremadoc Slates.—The Tremadoc slates of Sedgwick are more than 1000\r\nfeet in thickness, and consist of dark earthy slates occurring near the\r\nlittle town of Tremadoc, situated on the north side of Cardigan Bay, in\r\nCarnarvonshire. These slates were first examined by Sedgwick in 1831,\r\nand were re-examined by him and described in 1846,[1] after some\r\nfossils had been found in the underlying Lingula flags by Mr. Davis.\r\nThe inferiority in position of these Lingula flags to the Tremadoc beds\r\nwas at the same time established. The overlying Tremadoc beds were\r\ntraced by their pisolitic ore from Tremadoc to Dolgelly. No fossils\r\nproper to the Tremadoc slates were then observed, but subsequently,\r\nthirty-six species of all classes have been found in them, thanks to\r\nthe researches of Messrs. Salter, Homfray, and Ash. We have already\r\nseen that in the Arenig or Stiper-Stones group, where the species are\r\ndistinct, the genera agree with Silurian types; but in these Tremadoc\r\nslates, where the species are also peculiar, there is about an equal\r\nadmixture of Silurian types with those which Barrande has termed\r\n“primordial.” Here, therefore, it may truly be said that we are\r\nentering upon a new domain of life in our retrospective survey of the\r\npast. The trilobites of new species, but of Lower Silurian genera,\r\nbelong to _Ogygia, Asaphus,_ and _Cheirurus_; whereas those belonging\r\nto primordial types, or Barrande’s first fauna as well as to the\r\nLingula flags of Wales, comprise _Dikelocephalus, Conocoryphe_ (for\r\ngenera see Fig. 577 and 581),[2] _Olenus,_ and _Angelina._\r\n\r\nFig. 568: Theca (Cleidotheca operculata.\r\nIn the Tremadoc slates are found _Bellerophon, Orthoceras,_ and\r\n_Cyrtoceras,_ all specifically distinct from Lower Silurian fossils of\r\nthe same genera: the Pteropods _Theca_ (Fig. 568) and _Conularia_ range\r\nthroughout these slates; there are no Graptolites. The _Lingula\r\n(Lingulella) Davisii_ ranges from the top to the bottom of the\r\nformation, and links it with the zone next to be described. The\r\nTremadoc slates are very local, and seem to be confined to a small part\r\nof North Wales; and Professor Ramsay supposes them to lie unconformably\r\non the Lingula flags, and that a long interval of time elapsed between\r\nthese formations. Cephalopoda have not yet been found lower than this\r\ngroup, but it will be observed that they occur here associated with\r\ngenera of Trilobites considered by Barrande as characteristically\r\nPrimordial, some of which belong to all the divisions of the British\r\nCambrian about to be mentioned. This renders the absence of cephalopoda\r\nof less importance as bearing on the theory of development.\r\n\r\nLingula Flags.—Next below the Tremadoc slates in North Wales lie\r\nmicaceous flagstones and slates, in which, in 1846, Mr. E. Davis\r\ndiscovered the _Lingula (Lingulella),_ Fig. 570, named after him, and\r\nfrom which was derived the name of Lingula flags. These beds, which are\r\npalæontologically the equivalents of Barrande’s primordial zone, are\r\nrepresented by more than 5000 feet of strata, and have been studied\r\nchiefly in the neighbourhood of Dolgelly, Ffestiniog, and Portmadoc in\r\nNorth Wales, and at St. David’s in South Wales. They have yielded about\r\nforty species of fossils, of which six only are common to the overlying\r\nTremadoc rocks, but the two formations are closely allied by having\r\nseveral characteristic “primordial” genera in common. _Dikelocephalus,\r\nOlenus_ (Fig. 571), and _Conocoryphe_ are prominent forms, as is also\r\n_Hymenocaris_ (Fig. 569), a genus of phyllopod crustacean entirely\r\nconfined to the Lingula Flags. According to Mr. Belt, who has devoted\r\nmuch attention to these beds, there are already palæontological data\r\nfor subdividing the Lingula Flags into three sections.[3]\r\n\r\n“Lingula Flags” of Dolgelly, and Ffestiniog; N. Wales.\r\n\r\nIn Merionethshire, according to Professor Ramsay, the Lingula Flags\r\nattain their greatest development; in Carnarvonshire they thin out so\r\nas to have lost two-thirds of their thickness in eleven miles, while in\r\nAnglesea and on the Menai Straits both they and the Tremadoc beds are\r\nentirely absent, and the Lower Silurian rests directly on Lower\r\nCambrian strata.\r\n\r\nLOWER CAMBRIAN.\r\n\r\nMenevian Beds.—Immediately beneath the Lingula Flags there occurs a\r\nseries of dark grey and black flags and slates alternating at the upper\r\npart with some beds of sandstone, the whole reaching a thickness of\r\nfrom 500 to 600 feet. These beds were formerly classed, on purely\r\nlithological grounds, as the base of the Lingula Flags, but Messrs.\r\nHicks and Salter, to whose exertions we owe almost all our knowledge of\r\nthe fossils, have pointed out[4] that the most characteristic genera\r\nfound in them are quite unknown in the Lingula Flags, while they\r\npossess many of the strictly Lower Cambrian genera, such as _\r\nMicrodiscus_ and _Paradoxides._ They therefore proposed to place them,\r\nand it seems to me with good reason, at the top of the Lower Cambrian\r\nunder the term “Menevian,” Menevia being the classical name of St.\r\nDavid’s. The beds are well exhibited in the neighbourhood of St.\r\nDavid’s in South Wales, and near Dolgelly and Maentwrog in North Wales.\r\nThey are the equivalents of the lowest part of Barrande’s Primordial\r\nZone (Étage C). More than forty species have been found in them, and\r\nthe group is altogether very rich in fossils for so early a period.\r\n\r\nFig. 572: Paradoxides Davidis.\r\nThe trilobites are of large size; _Paradoxides Davidis_ (see Fig. 572),\r\nthe largest trilobite known in England, 22 inches or nearly two feet\r\nlong, is peculiar to the Menevian Beds. By referring to the Bohemian\r\ntrilobite of the same genus (Fig. 576), the reader will at once see how\r\nthese fossils (though of such different dimensions) resemble each other\r\nin Bohemia and Wales, and other closely allied species from the two\r\nregions might be added, besides some which are common to both\r\ncountries. The Swedish fauna, presently to be mentioned, will be found\r\nto be still more nearly connected with the Welsh Menevian. In all these\r\ncountries there is an equally marked difference between the Cambrian\r\nfossils and those of the Upper and Lower Silurian rocks. The trilobite\r\nwith the largest number of rings, _ Erinnys venulosa,_ occurs here in\r\nconjunction with _ Agnostus_ and _Microdiscus,_ the genera with the\r\nsmallest number. Blind trilobites are also found as well as those which\r\nhave the largest eyes, such as _Microdiscus_ on the one hand, and\r\n_Anoplenus_ on the other.\r\n\r\nLONGMYND GROUP.\r\n\r\nOlder than the Menevian Beds are a thick series of olive green, purple,\r\nred and grey grits and conglomerates found in North and South Wales,\r\nShropshire, and parts of Ireland and Scotland. They have been called by\r\nProfessor Sedgwick the Longmynd or Bangor Group, comprising, first, the\r\nHarlech and Barmouth sandstones; and secondly, the Llanberis slates.\r\n\r\nFig. 573: Histioderma Hibernica.\r\nHarlech Grits.—The sandstones of this period attain in the Longmynd\r\nhills a thickness of no less than 6000 feet without any interposition\r\nof volcanic matter; in some places in Merionethshire they are still\r\nthicker. Until recently these rocks possessed but a very scanty fauna.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of five species of annelids (see Fig. 460) brought\r\nto light by Mr. Salter in Shropshire, and Dr. Kinahan in Wicklow, and\r\nan obscure crustacean form, _Palæopyge Ramsayi,_ they were supposed to\r\nbe barren of organic remains. Now, however, through the labours of Mr.\r\nHicks,[5] they have yielded at St. David’s a rich fauna of trilobites,\r\nbrachiopods, phyllopods, and pteropods, showing, together with other\r\nfossils, a by no means low state of organisation at this early period.\r\nAlready the fauna amounts to 20 species referred to 17 genera.\r\n\r\nA new genus of trilobite called _Plutonia Sedgwickii,_ not yet figured\r\nand described, has been met with in the Harlech grits. It is comparable\r\nin size to the large _Paradoxides Davidis_ before mentioned, has\r\nwell-developed eyes, and is covered all over with tubercles. In the\r\nsame strata occur other genera of trilobites, namely, _Conocoryphe,\r\nParadoxides, Microdiscus,_ and the Pteropod _Theca_ (Fig. 568), all\r\nrepresented by species peculiar to the Harlech grits. The sands of this\r\nformation are often rippled, and were evidently left dry at low tides,\r\nso that the surface was dried by the sun and made to shrink and present\r\nsun-cracks. There are also distinct impressions of rain-drops on many\r\nsurfaces, like those in Fig. 444 and 445.\r\n\r\nLanberis Slates.—The slates of Llanberis and Penrhyn in Carnarvonshire,\r\nwith their associated sandy strata, attain a great thickness, sometimes\r\nabout 3000 feet. They are perhaps not more ancient than the Harlech and\r\nBarmouth beds last mentioned, for they may represent the deposits of\r\nfine mud thrown down in the same sea, on the borders of which the sands\r\nabove-mentioned were accumulating. In some of these slaty rocks in\r\nIreland, immediately opposite Anglesea and Carnarvon, two species of\r\nfossils have been found, to which the late Professor E. Forbes gave the\r\nname of _Oldhamia._ The nature of these organisms is still a matter of\r\ndiscussion among naturalists.\r\n\r\nFig. 574: Oldhamia radiata.\r\nFig. 575: Oldhamia antiqua.\r\nCambrian Rocks of Bohemia _(Primordial zone of Barrande)._—In the year\r\n1846, as before stated, M. Joachim Barrande, after ten years’\r\nexploration of Bohemia, and after collecting more than a thousand\r\nspecies of fossils, had ascertained the existence in that country of\r\nthree distinct faunas below the Devonian. To his first fauna, which was\r\nolder than any then known in this country, he gave the name of Étage C;\r\nhis two first stages A and B consisting of crystalline and metamorphic\r\nrocks and unfossiliferous schists. This Étage C or primordial zone\r\nproved afterwards to be the equivalent of those subdivisions of the\r\nCambrian groups which have been above described under the names of\r\nMenevian and Lingula Flags. The second fauna tallies with Murchison’s\r\nLower Silurian, as originally defined by him when no fossils had been\r\ndiscovered below the Stiper-Stones. The third fauna agrees with the\r\nUpper Silurian of the same author. Barrande, without government\r\nassistance, had undertaken single-handed the geological survey of\r\nBohemia, the fossils previously obtained from that country having\r\nscarcely exceeded 20 in number, whereas he had already acquired, in\r\n1850, no less than 1100 species, namely, 250 crustaceans (chiefly\r\nTrilobites), 250 Cephalopods, 160 gasteropods and pteropods, 130\r\nacephalous mollusks, 210 brachiopods, and 110 corals and other fossils.\r\nThese numbers have since been almost doubled by subsequent\r\ninvestigations in the same country.\r\n\r\nIn the primordial zone C, he discovered trilobites of the genera\r\n_Paradoxides, Conocoryphe, Ellipsocephalus, Sao, Arionellus,\r\nHydrocephalus,_ and _Agnostus._ M. Barrande pointed out that these\r\nprimordial trilobites have a peculiar facies of their own dependent on\r\nthe multiplication of their thoracic segments and the diminution of\r\ntheir caudal shield or pygidium.\r\n\r\n_Fossils of the lowest Fossiliferous Beds in Bohemia, or\r\n“Primordial Zone” of Barrande._\r\n\r\nFig. 576: Paradoxides Bohemicus. Fig. 577: Conocoryphe striata. Fig.\r\n578: Agnostus integer. Fig. 579: Agnostus Rex. Fig. 580: Sao hirsuta in\r\nits various stages of growth.\r\n\r\nOne of the “primordial” or Upper Cambrian Trilobites of the genus\r\n_Sao,_ a form not found as yet elsewhere in the world, afforded M.\r\nBarrande a fine illustration of the metamorphosis of these creatures,\r\nfor he traced them through no less than twenty stages of their\r\ndevelopment. A few of these changes have been selected for\r\nrepresentation in Figure 580, that the reader may learn the gradual\r\nmanner in which different segments of the body and the eyes make their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia the primordial fauna of Barrande derived its importance\r\nexclusively from its numerous and peculiar trilobites. Besides these,\r\nhowever, the same ancient schists have yielded two genera of\r\nbrachiopods, _Orthis_ and _Orbicula,_ a Pteropod of the genus _Theca,_\r\nand four echinoderms of the cystidean family.\r\n\r\nCambrian of Sweden and Norway.—The Cambrian beds of Wales are\r\nrepresented in Sweden by strata the fossils of which have been\r\ndescribed by a most able naturalist, M. Angelin, in his “Palæontologica\r\nSuecica” (1852-4). The “alum-schists,” as they are called in Sweden,\r\nare horizontal argillaceous rocks which underlie conformably certain\r\nLower Silurian strata in the mountain called Kinnekulle, south of the\r\ngreat Wener Lake in Sweden. These schists contain trilobites belonging\r\nto the genera _Paradoxides, Olenus, Agnostus,_ and others, some of\r\nwhich present rudimentary forms, like the genus last mentioned, without\r\neyes, and with the body segments scarcely developed, and others, again,\r\nhave the number of segments excessively multiplied, as in\r\n_Paradoxides._ Such peculiarities agree with the characters of the\r\ncrustaceans met with in the Cambrian strata of Wales; and Dr. Torell\r\nhas recently found in Sweden the _Paradoxides Hicksii,_ a well-known\r\nLower Cambrian fossil.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the Cambrian strata in Sweden, which in the\r\nneighbourhood of Lake Wener are perfectly horizontal, lie ripple-marked\r\nquartzose sandstones with worm-tracks and annelid borings, like some of\r\nthose found in the Harlech grits of the Longmynd. Among these are some\r\nwhich have been referred doubtfully to plants. These sandstones have\r\nbeen called in Sweden “fucoid sandstones.” The whole thickness of the\r\nCambrian rocks of Sweden does not exceed 300 feet from the equivalents\r\nof the Tremadoc beds to these sandstones, which last seem to correspond\r\nwith the Longmynd, and are regarded by Torell as older than any\r\nfossiliferous primordial rocks in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nCambrian of the United States and Canada _(Potsdam Sandstone)._—This\r\nformation, as we learn from Sir W. Logan, is 700 feet thick in Canada;\r\nthe upper part consists of sandstone containing fucoids, and perforated\r\nby small vertical holes, which are very characteristic of the rock, and\r\nappear to have been made by annelids _(Scolithus linearis)._ The lower\r\nportion is a conglomerate with quartz pebbles. I have seen the Potsdam\r\nsandstone on the banks of the St. Lawrence, and on the borders of Lake\r\nChamplain, where, as at Keesville, it is a white quartzose fine-grained\r\ngrit, almost passing into quartzite. It is divided into horizontal\r\nripple-marked beds, very like those of the Lingula Flags of Britain,\r\nand replete with a small round-shaped _ Obolella,_ in such numbers as\r\nto divide the rock into parallel planes, in the same manner as do the\r\nscales of mica in some micaceous sandstones. Among the shells of this\r\nformation in Wisconsin are species of _Lingula_ and _Orthis,_ and\r\nseveral trilobites of the primordial genus _Dikelocephalus_ (Fig. 581).\r\nOn the banks of the St. Lawrence, near Beauharnois and elsewhere, many\r\nfossil footprints have been observed on the surface of the rippled\r\nlayers. They are supposed by Professor Owen to be the trails of more\r\nthan one species of articulate animal, probably allied to the King\r\nCrab, or _Limulus._\r\n\r\nFig. 581: Dikelocephalus Minnesotensis.\r\nRecent investigations by the naturalists of the Canadian survey have\r\nrendered it certain that below the level of the Potsdam Sandstone there\r\nare slates and schists extending from New York to Newfoundland,\r\noccupied by a series of trilobitic forms similar in genera, though not\r\nin species, to those found in the European Upper Cambrian strata.\r\n\r\nHuronian Series.—Next below the Upper Cambrian occur strata called the\r\nHuronian by Sir W. Logan, which are of vast thickness, consisting\r\nchiefly of quartzite, with great masses of greenish chloritic slate,\r\nwhich sometimes include pebbles of crystalline rocks derived from the\r\nLaurentian formation, next to be described. Limestones are rare in this\r\nseries, but one band of 300 feet in thickness has been traced for\r\nconsiderable distances to the north of Lake Huron. Beds of greenstone\r\nare intercalated conformably with the quartzose and argillaceous\r\nmembers of this series. No organic remains have yet been found in any\r\nof the beds, which are about 18,000 feet thick, and rest unconformably\r\non the Laurentian rocks.\r\n\r\nLAURENTIAN GROUP.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the geological survey carried on under the direction\r\nof Sir W.E. Logan, it has been shown that, northward of the river St.\r\nLawrence, there is a vast series of crystalline rocks of gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, quartzite, and limestone, more than 30,000 feet in\r\nthickness, which have been called Laurentian, and which are already\r\nknown to occupy an area of about 200,000 square miles. They are not\r\nonly more ancient than the fossiliferous Cambrian formations above\r\ndescribed, but are older than the Huronian last mentioned, and had\r\nundergone great disturbing movements before the Potsdam sandstone and\r\nthe other “primordial” or Cambrian rocks were formed. The older half of\r\nthis Laurentian series is unconformable to the newer portion of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nUpper Laurentian or Labrador Series.—The Upper Group, more than 10,000\r\nfeet thick, consists of stratified crystalline rocks in which no\r\norganic remains have yet been found. They consist in great part of\r\nfeldspars, which vary in composition from anorthite to andesine, or\r\nfrom those kinds in which there is less than one per cent of potash and\r\nsoda to those in which there is more than seven per cent of these\r\nalkalies, the soda preponderating greatly. These feldsparites sometimes\r\nform mountain masses almost without any admixture of other minerals;\r\nbut at other times they include augite, which passes into hypersthene.\r\nThey are often granitoid in structure. One of the varieties is the same\r\nas the apolescent labradorite rock of Labrador. The Adirondack\r\nMountains in the State of New York are referred to the same series, and\r\nit is conjectured that the hypersthene rocks of Skye, which resemble\r\nthis formation in mineral character, may be of the same geological age.\r\n\r\nLower Laurentian.—This series, about 20,000 feet in thickness, is, as\r\nbefore stated, unconformable to that last mentioned; it consists in\r\ngreat part of gneiss of a reddish tint with orthoclase feldspar. Beds\r\nof nearly pure quartz, from 400 to 600 feet thick, occur in some\r\nplaces. Hornblendic and micaceous schists are often interstratified,\r\nand beds of limestone, usually crystalline. Beds of plumbago also\r\noccur. That this pure carbon may have been of organic origin before\r\nmetamorphism has naturally been conjectured.\r\n\r\nThere are several of these limestones which have been traced to great\r\ndistances, and one of them is from 700 to 1500 feet thick. In the most\r\nmassive of them Sir W. Logan observed, in 1859, what he considered to\r\nbe an organic body much resembling the Silurian fossil called\r\n_Stromatopora rugosa._ It had been obtained the year before by Mr. J.\r\nMacMullen at the Grand Calumet, on the river Ottawa. This fossil was\r\nexamined in 1864 by Dr. Dawson of Montreal, who detected in it, by aid\r\nof the microscope, the distinct structure of a Rhizopod or Foraminifer.\r\nDr. Carpenter and Professor T. Rupert Jones have since confirmed this\r\nopinion, comparing the structure to that of the well-known nummulite.\r\nIt appears to have grown one layer over another, and to have formed\r\nreefs of limestone as do the living coral-building polyp animals. Parts\r\nof the original skeleton, consisting of carbonate of lime, are still\r\npreserved; while certain inter-spaces in the calcareous fossil have\r\nbeen filled up with serpentine and white augite. On this oldest of\r\nknown organic remains Dr. Dawson has conferred the name of _ Eozoon_\r\n_Canadense_ (see Figs. 582, 583); its antiquity is such that the\r\ndistance of time which separated it from the Upper Cambrian period, or\r\nthat of the Potsdam sandstone, may, says Sir W. Logan, be equal to the\r\ntime which elapsed between the Potsdam sandstone and the nummulitic\r\nlimestones of the Tertiary period. The Laurentian and Huronian rocks\r\nunited are about 50,000 feet in thickness, and the Lower Laurentian was\r\ndisturbed before the newer series was deposited. We may naturally\r\nexpect the other proofs of unconformability will hereafter be detected\r\nat more than one point in so vast a succession of strata.\r\n\r\nFig. 582 and 583: Eozoon Canadense.\r\n\r\nFig. 582. _a._ Chambers of lower tier communicating at +, and separated\r\nfrom adjoining chambers at O by an intervening septum, traversed by\r\npassages. _b._ Chambers of an upper tier. _c._ Walls of the chambers\r\ntraversed by fine tubules. (These tubules pass with uniform parallelism\r\nfrom the inner to the outer surface, opening at regular distances from\r\neach other.) _d._ Intermediate skeleton, composed of homogeneous shell\r\nsubstance, traversed by _f._ Stoloniferous passages connecting the\r\nchambers of the two tiers. _e._ Canal system in intermediate skeleton,\r\nshowing the arborescent saceodic prolongations. (Fig. 583 shows these\r\nbodies in a decalcified state.) _f._ Stoloniferous passages.\r\nFig. 583. Decalcified portion of natural rock, showing _canal system_\r\nand the several layers; the acuteness of the planes prevents more than\r\none or two parallel tiers being observed.\r\n\r\nThe mineral character of the Upper Laurentian differs, as we have seen,\r\nfrom that of the Lower, and the pebbles of gneiss in the Huronian\r\nconglomerates are thought to prove that the Laurentian strata were\r\nalready in a metamorphic state before they were broken up to supply\r\nmaterials for the Huronian. Even if we had not discovered the Eozoon,\r\nwe might fairly have inferred from analogy that as the quartzites were\r\nonce beds of sand, and the gneiss and mica-schist derived from shales\r\nand argillaceous sandstones, so the calcareous masses, from 400 to 1000\r\nfeet and more in thickness, were originally of organic origin. This is\r\nnow generally believed to have been the case with the Silurian,\r\nDevonian, Carboniferous, Oolitic, and Cretaceous limestones and those\r\nnummulitic rocks of tertiary date which bear the closest affinity to\r\nthe Eozoon reefs of the Lower Laurentian. The oldest stratified rock in\r\nScotland is that called by Sir R. Murchison “the fundamental gneiss,”\r\nwhich is found in the north-west of Ross-shire, and in Sutherlandshire\r\n(see Fig. 82), and forms the whole of the adjoining island of Lewis, in\r\nthe Hebrides. It has a strike from north-west to south-east, nearly at\r\nright angles to the metamorphic strata of the Grampians. On this\r\nLaurentian gneiss, in parts of the western Highlands, the Lower\r\nCambrian and various metamorphic rocks rest unconformably. It seems\r\nhighly probable that this ancient gneiss of Scotland may correspond in\r\ndate with part of the great Laurentian group of North America.\r\n\r\n [1] Quart. Geol.

Volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nExternal Form, Structure, and Origin of Volcanic Mountains.—The origin\r\nof volcanic cones with crater-shaped summits has been explained in the\r\n“Principles of Geology” (Chapters 23 to 27), where Vesuvius, Etna,\r\nSantorin, and Barren Island are described. The more ancient portions of\r\nthose mountains or islands, formed long before the times of history,\r\nexhibit the same external features and internal structure which belong\r\nto most of the extinct volcanoes of still higher antiquity; and these\r\nlast have evidently been due to a complicated series of operations,\r\nvaried in kind according to circumstances; as, for example, whether the\r\naccumulation took place above or below the level of the sea, whether\r\nthe lava issued from one or several contiguous vents, and, lastly,\r\nwhether the rocks reduced to fusion in the subterranean regions\r\nhappened to have contained more or less silica, potash, soda, lime,\r\niron, and other ingredients. We are best acquainted with the effects of\r\neruptions above water, or those called subÆrial or supramarine; yet the\r\nproducts even of these are arranged in so many ways that their\r\ninterpretation has given rise to a variety of contradictory opinions,\r\nsome of which will have to be considered in this chapter.\r\n\r\nFig. 585: Part of the chain of extinct volcanoes called the Monts Dome,\r\nAurvergne.\r\n\r\n_Cones and Craters._—In regions where the eruption of volcanic matter\r\nhas taken place in the open air, and where the surface has never since\r\nbeen subjected to great aqueous denudation, cones and craters\r\nconstitute the most striking peculiarity of this class of formations.\r\nMany hundreds of these cones are seen in central France, in the ancient\r\nprovinces of Auvergne, Velay, and Vivarais, where they observe, for the\r\nmost part, a linear arrangement, and form chains of hills. Although\r\nnone of the eruptions have happened within the historical era, the\r\nstreams of lava may still be traced distinctly descending from many of\r\nthe craters, and following the lowest levels of the existing valleys.\r\nThe origin of the cone and crater-shaped hill is well understood, the\r\ngrowth of many having been watched during volcanic eruptions. A chasm\r\nor fissure first opens in the earth, from which great volumes of steam\r\nare evolved. The explosions are so violent as to hurl up into the air\r\nfragments of broken stone, parts of which are shivered into minute\r\natoms. At the same time melted stone or _lava_ usually ascends through\r\nthe chimney or vent by which the gases make their escape. Although\r\nextremely heavy, this lava is forced up by the expansive power of\r\nentangled gaseous fluids, chiefly steam or aqueous vapour, exactly in\r\nthe same manner as water is made to boil over the edge of a vessel when\r\nsteam has been generated at the bottom by heat. Large quantities of the\r\nlava are also shot up into the air, where it separates into fragments,\r\nand acquires a spongy texture by the sudden enlargement of the included\r\ngases, and thus forms _scoriæ,_ other portions being reduced to an\r\nimpalpable powder or dust. The showering down of the various ejected\r\nmaterials round the orifice of eruption gives rise to a conical mound,\r\nin which the successive envelopes of sand and scoriæ form layers,\r\ndipping on all sides from a central axis. In the mean time a hollow,\r\ncalled a _ crater,_ has been kept open in the middle of the mound by\r\nthe continued passage upward of steam and other gaseous fluids. The\r\nlava sometimes flows over the edge of the crater, and thus thickens and\r\nstrengthens the sides of the cone; but sometimes it breaks down the\r\ncone on one side (see Fig. 585), and often it flows out from a fissure\r\nat the base of the hill, or at some distance from its base.\r\n\r\nSome geologists had erroneously supposed, from observations made on\r\nrecent cones of eruption, that lava which consolidates on steep slopes\r\nis always of a scoriaceous or vesicular structure, and never of that\r\ncompact texture which we find in those rocks which are usually termed\r\n“trappean.” Misled by this theory, they have gone so far as to believe\r\nthat if melted matter has originally descended a slope at an angle\r\nexceeding four or five degrees, it never, on cooling, acquires a stony\r\ncompact texture. Consequently, whenever they found in a volcanic\r\nmountain sheets of stony materials inclined at angles of from 5° to 20°\r\nor even more than 30°, they thought themselves warranted in assuming\r\nthat such rocks had been originally horizontal, or very slightly\r\ninclined, and had acquired their high inclination by subsequent\r\nupheaval. To such dome-shaped mountains with a cavity in the middle,\r\nand with the inclined beds having what was called a quâquâversal dip or\r\na slope outward on all sides, they gave the name of “Elevation\r\ncraters.”\r\n\r\nAs the late Leopold Von Buch, the author of this theory, had selected\r\nthe Isle of Palma, one of the Canaries, as a typical illustration of\r\nthis form of volcanic mountain, I visited that island in 1854, in\r\ncompany with my friend Mr. Hartung, and I satisfied myself that it owes\r\nits origin to a series of eruptions of the same nature as those which\r\nformed the minor cones, already alluded to. In some of the more ancient\r\nor Miocene volcanic mountains, such as Mont Dor and Cantal in central\r\nFrance, the mode of origin by upheaval as above described is attributed\r\nto those dome-shaped masses, whether they possess or not a great\r\ncentral cavity, as in Palma. Where this cavity is present, it has\r\nprobably been due to one or more great explosions similar to that which\r\ndestroyed a great part of ancient Vesuvius in the time of Pliny.\r\nSimilar paroxysmal catastrophes have caused in historical times the\r\ntruncation on a grand scale of some large cones in Java and\r\nelsewhere.[1]\r\n\r\nAmong the objections which may be considered as fatal to Von Buch’s\r\ndoctrine of upheaval in these cases, I may state that a series of\r\nvolcanic formations extending over an area six or seven miles in its\r\nshortest diameter, as in Palma, could not be accumulated in the form of\r\nlavas, tuffs, and volcanic breccias or agglomerates without producing a\r\nmountain as lofty as that which they now constitute. But assuming that\r\nthey were first horizontal, and then lifted up by a force acting most\r\npowerfully in the centre and tilting the beds on all sides, a central\r\ncrater having been formed by explosion or by a chasm opening in the\r\nmiddle, where the continuity of the rocks was interrupted, we should\r\nhave a right to expect that the chief ravines or valleys would open\r\ntowards the central cavity, instead of which the rim of the great\r\ncrater in Palma and other similar ancient volcanoes is entire for more\r\nthan three parts of the whole circumference.\r\n\r\nIf dikes are seen in the precipices surrounding such craters or central\r\ncavities, they certainly imply rents which were filled up with liquid\r\nmatter. But none of the dislocations producing such rents can have\r\nbelonged to the supposed period of terminal and paroxysmal upheaval,\r\nfor had a great central crater been already formed before they\r\noriginated, or at the time when they took place, the melted matter,\r\ninstead of filling the narrow vents, would have flowed down into the\r\nbottom of the cavity, and would have obliterated it to a certain\r\nextent. Making due allowance for the quantity of matter removed by\r\nsubaërial denudation in volcanic mountains of high antiquity, and for\r\nthe grand explosions which are known to have caused truncation in\r\nactive volcanoes, there is no reason for calling in the violent\r\nhypothesis of elevation craters to explain the structure of such\r\nmountains as Teneriffe, the Grand Canary, Palma, or those of central\r\nFrance, Etna, or Vesuvius, all of which I have examined. With regard to\r\nEtna, I have shown, from observations made by me in 1857, that modern\r\nlavas, several of them of known date, have formed continuous beds of\r\ncompact stone even on slopes of 15, 36, and 38 degrees, and, in the\r\ncase of the lava of 1852, more than 40 degrees. The thickness of these\r\ntabular layers varies from 1½ foot to 26 feet. And their planes of\r\nstratification are parallel to those of the overlying and underlying\r\nscoriæ which form part of the same currents.[2]\r\n\r\nNomenclature of Trappean Rocks.—When geologists first began to examine\r\nattentively the structure of the northern and western parts of Europe,\r\nthey were almost entirely ignorant of the phenomena of existing\r\nvolcanoes. They found certain rocks, for the most part without\r\nstratification, and of a peculiar mineral composition, to which they\r\ngave different names, such as basalt, greenstone, porphyry, trap tuff,\r\nand amygdaloid. All these, which were recognised as belonging to one\r\nfamily, were called “trap” by Bergmann, from _trappa,_ Swedish for a\r\nflight of steps—a name since adopted very generally into the\r\nnomenclature of the science; for it was observed that many rocks of\r\nthis class occurred in great tabular masses of unequal extent, so as to\r\nform a succession of terraces or steps. It was also felt that some\r\ngeneral term was indispensable, because these rocks, although very\r\ndiversified in form and composition, evidently belonged to one group,\r\ndistinguishable from the Plutonic as well as from the non-volcanic\r\nfossiliferous rocks.\r\n\r\nBy degrees familiarity with the products of active volcanoes convinced\r\ngeologists more and more that they were identical with the trappean\r\nrocks. In every stream of modern lava there is some variation in\r\ncharacter and composition, and even where no important difference can\r\nbe recognised in the proportions of silica, alumina, lime, potash,\r\niron, and other elementary materials, the resulting materials are often\r\nnot the same, for reasons which we are as yet unable to explain. The\r\ndifference also of the lavas poured out from the same mountain at two\r\ndistinct periods, especially in the quantity of silica which they\r\ncontain, is often so great as to give rise to rocks which are regarded\r\nas forming distinct families, although there may be every intermediate\r\ngradation between the two extremes, and although some rocks, forming a\r\ntransition from the one class to the other, may often be so abundant as\r\nto demand special names. These species might be multiplied\r\nindefinitely, and I can only afford space to name a few of the\r\nprincipal ones, about the composition and aspect of which there is the\r\nleast discordance of opinion.\r\n\r\nMinerals most abundant in Volcanic Rocks.—The minerals which form the\r\nchief constituents of these igneous rocks are few in number. Next to\r\nquartz, which is nearly pure silica or silicic acid, the most important\r\nare those silicates commonly classed under the several heads of\r\nfeldspar, mica, hornblende or augite, and olivine. In Table 28.1, in\r\ndrawing up which I have received the able assistance of Mr. David\r\nForbes, the chemical analysis of these minerals and their varieties is\r\nshown, and he has added the specific gravity of the different mineral\r\nspecies, the geological application of which in determining the rocks\r\nformed by these minerals will be explained in the sequel (p.504).\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Minerals most abundant in the Volcanic and Hypogene\r\nRocks._\r\n\r\nTHE QUARTZ GROUP QUARTZ 100·0\r\n2·6 Silica\r\nSpecific gravity TRIDYMITE 100·0\r\n2·3 Silica\r\nSpecific gravity THE FELDSPAR GROUP ORTHOCLASE.\r\n—— Carisbad, in granite (bulk) 65·23\r\n16·26\r\n0·27\r\nnil\r\ntrace\r\nnil\r\n14·66\r\n1·45\r\nnil\r\n2·55 Silica\r\nAlumina\r\nSesquioxide of Iron\r\nProtoxides of Iron and Manganese\r\nLime\r\nMagnesia\r\nPotash\r\nSoda\r\nOther constituents\r\nSpecific gravity —— Sanadine, Drachenfels in trachyte\r\n(Rammelsberg) 65·87\r\n18·53\r\nnil\r\nnil\r\n0·95\r\n0·30\r\n10·32\r\n3·49\r\nW. 0·44\r\n2·55 Silica\r\nAlumina\r\nSesquioxide of Iron\r\nProtoxides of Iron and Manganese\r\nLime\r\nMagnesia\r\nPotash\r\nSoda\r\nOther constituents\r\nSpecific gravity ALBITE.\r\n—— Arendal, in granite (G.

The other salts of lime, including its carbonate or calcite,\r\nalthough often met with, are invariably products of secondary chemical\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe Zeolites, above mentioned, so named from the manner in which they\r\nfroth up under the blow-pipe and melt into a glass, differ in their\r\nchemical composition from all the other mineral constituents of\r\nvolcanic rocks, since they are hydrated silicates containing from 10 to\r\n25 per cent of water. They abound in some trappean rocks and ancient\r\nlavas, where they fill up vesicular cavities and interstices in the\r\nsubstance of the rocks, but are rarely found in any quantity in recent\r\nlavas; in most cases they are to be regarded as secondary products\r\nformed by the action of water on the other constituents of the rocks.\r\nAmong them the species Analcime, Stilbite, Natrolite, and Chabazite may\r\nbe mentioned as of most common occurrence.\r\n\r\nQuartz Group.—The microscope has shown that pure quartz is oftener\r\npresent in lavas than was formerly supposed. It had been argued that\r\nthe quartz in granite having a specific gravity of 2·6, was not of\r\npurely igneous origin, because the silica resulting from fusion in the\r\nlaboratory has only a specific gravity of 2·3. But Mr. David Forbes has\r\nascertained that the free quartz in trachytes, which are known to have\r\nflowed as lava, has the same specific gravity as the ordinary quartz of\r\ngranite; and the recent researches of Von Rath and others prove that\r\nthe mineral Tridymite, which is crystallised silica of specific gravity\r\n2·3 (see Table, p. 499), is of common occurrence in the volcanic rocks\r\nof Mexico, Auvergne, the Rhine, and elsewhere, although hitherto\r\nentirely overlooked.\r\n\r\nFeldspar Group.—In the Feldspar group (Table, p. 499) the five mineral\r\nspecies most commonly met with as rock constituents are: 1. Orthoclase,\r\noften called common or potash-feldspar. 2. Albite, or soda-feldspar, a\r\nmineral which plays a more subordinate part than was formerly supposed,\r\nthis name having been given to much which has since been proved to be\r\nOligoclase. 3. Oligoclase, or soda-lime feldspar, in which soda is\r\npresent in much larger proportion than lime, and of which mineral\r\nandesite are andesine, is considered to be a variety. 4. Labradorite,\r\nor lime-soda-feldspar, in which the proportions of lime and soda are\r\nthe reverse to what they are in Oligoclase. 5. Anorthite or\r\nlime-feldspar. The two latter feldspars are rarely if ever found to\r\nenter into the composition of rocks containing quartz.\r\n\r\nIn employing such terms as potash-feldspar, etc., it must, however,\r\nalways be borne in mind that it is only intended to direct attention to\r\nthe predominant alkali or alkaline earth in the mineral, not to assert\r\nthe absence of the others, which in most cases will be found to be\r\npresent in minor quantity. Thus potash-feldspar (orthoclase) almost\r\nalways contains a little soda, and often traces of lime or magnesia;\r\nand in like manner with the others. The terms “glassy” and “compact”\r\nfeldspars only refer to structure, and not to species or composition;\r\nthe student should be prepared to meet with any of the above feldspars\r\nin either of these conditions: the glassy state being apparently due to\r\nquick cooling, and the compact to conditions unfavourable to\r\ncrystallisation; the so-called “compact feldspar” is also very commonly\r\nfound to be an admixture of more than one feldspar species, and\r\nfrequently also contains quartz and other extraneous mineral matter\r\nonly to be detected by the microscope.\r\n\r\nFeldspars when arranged according to their system of crystallisation\r\nare _monoclinic,_ having one axis obliquely inclined; or _triclinic,_\r\nhaving the three axes all obliquely inclined to each other. If arranged\r\nwith reference to their cleavage they are _orthoclastic,_ the fracture\r\ntaking place always at a right angle; or _plagioclastic,_ in which the\r\ncleavages are oblique to one another. Orthoclase is orthoclastic and\r\nmonoclinic; all the other feldspars are plagioclastic and triclinic.\r\n\r\n_Minerals in Meteorites._—That variety of the Feldspar Group which is\r\ncalled Anorthite has been shown by Rammelsberg to occur in a meteoric\r\nstone, and his analysis proves it to be almost identical in its\r\nchemical proportions to the same mineral in the lavas of modern\r\nvolcanoes. So also Bronzite (Enstatite) and Olivine have been met with\r\nin meteorites shown by analysis to come remarkably near to these\r\nminerals in ordinary rocks.\r\n\r\nMica Group.—With regard to the micas, the four principal species\r\n(Table, p. 499) all contain potash in nearly the same proportion, but\r\ndiffer greatly in the proportion and nature of their other ingredients.\r\nMuscovite is often called common or potash mica; Lepidolite is\r\ncharacterised by containing lithia in addition; Biotite contains a\r\nlarge amount of magnesia and oxide of iron; whilst Phlogopite contains\r\nstill more of the former substance. In rocks containing quartz,\r\nmuscovite or lepidolite are most common. The mica in recent volcanic\r\nrocks, gabbros, and diorites is usually Biotite, while that so common\r\nin metamorphic limestones is usually, if not always, Phlogopite.\r\n\r\nAmphibole and Pyroxene Group.—The minerals included in the table under\r\nthe Amphibole and Pyroxene Group differ somewhat in their\r\ncrystallisation form, though they all belong to the monoclinic system.\r\nAmphibole is a general name for all the different varieties of\r\nHornblende, Actinolite, Tremolite, etc., while Pyroxene includes\r\nAugite, Diallage, Malacolite, Sahlite, etc. The two divisions are so\r\nmuch allied in chemical composition and crystallographic characters,\r\nand blend so completely one into the other in Uralite (see page 499),\r\nthat it is perhaps best to unite them in one group.\r\n\r\nTheory of Isomorphism.—The history of the changes of opinion on this\r\npoint is curious and instructive. Werner first distinguished augite\r\nfrom hornblende; and his proposal to separate them obtained afterwards\r\nthe sanction of Haüy, Mohs, and other celebrated mineralogists. It was\r\nagreed that the form of the crystals of the two species was different,\r\nand also their structure, as shown by _cleavage_—that is to say, by\r\nbreaking or cleaving the mineral with a chisel, or a blow of the\r\nhammer, in the direction in which it yields most readily. It was also\r\nfound by analysis that augite usually contained more lime, less\r\nalumina, and no fluoric acid; which last, though not always found in\r\nhornblende, often enters into its composition in minute quantity. In\r\naddition to these characters, it was remarked as a geological fact,\r\nthat augite and hornblende are very rarely associated together in the\r\nsame rock. It was also remarked that in the crystalline slags of\r\nfurnaces augitic forms were frequent, the hornblendic entirely absent;\r\nhence it was conjectured that hornblende might be the result of slow,\r\nand augite of rapid cooling. This view was confirmed by the fact that\r\nMitscherlich and Berthier were able to make augite artificially, but\r\ncould never succeed in forming hornblende. Lastly, Gustavus Rose fused\r\na mass of hornblende in a porcelain furnace, and found that it did not,\r\non cooling, assume its previous shape, but invariably took that of\r\naugite. The same mineralogist observed certain crystals called Uralite\r\n(see Table, p. 499) in rocks from Siberia, which possessed the cleavage\r\nand chemical composition of hornblende, while they had the external\r\nform of augite.\r\n\r\nIf, from these data, it is inferred that the same substance may assume\r\nthe crystalline forms of hornblende or augite indifferently, according\r\nto the more or less rapid cooling of the melted mass, it is\r\nnevertheless certain that the variety commonly called augite, and\r\nrecognised by a peculiar crystalline form, has usually more lime in it,\r\nand less alumina, than that called hornblende, although the quantities\r\nof these elements do not seem to be always the same. Unquestionably the\r\nfacts and experiments above mentioned show the very near affinity of\r\nhornblende and augite; but even the convertibility of one into the\r\nother, by melting and recrystallising, does not perhaps demonstrate\r\ntheir absolute identity. For there is often some portion of the\r\nmaterials in a crystal which are not in perfect chemical combination\r\nwith the rest. Carbonate of lime, for example, sometimes carries with\r\nit a considerable quantity of silex into its own form of crystal, the\r\nsilex being mechanically mixed as sand, and yet not preventing the\r\ncarbonate of lime from assuming the form proper to it. This is an\r\nextreme case, but in many others some one or more of the ingredients in\r\na crystal may be excluded from perfect chemical union; and after\r\nfusion, when the mass recrystallises, the same elements may combine\r\nperfectly or in new proportions, and thus a new mineral may be\r\nproduced. Or some one of the gaseous elements of the atmosphere, the\r\noxygen for example, may, when the melted matter reconsolidates, combine\r\nwith some one of the component elements.\r\n\r\nThe different quantity of the impurities or the refuse above alluded\r\nto, which may occur in all but the most transparent and perfect\r\ncrystals, may partly explain the discordant results at which\r\nexperienced chemists have arrived in their analysis of the same\r\nmineral. For the reader will often find that crystals of a mineral\r\ndetermined to be the same by physical characters, crystalline form, and\r\noptical properties, have been declared by skilful analysers to be\r\ncomposed of distinct elements. This disagreement seemed at first\r\nsubversive of the atomic theory, or the doctrine that there is a fixed\r\nand constant relation between the crystalline form and structure of a\r\nmineral and its chemical composition. The apparent anomaly, however,\r\nwhich threatened to throw the whole science of mineralogy into\r\nconfusion, was reconciled to fixed principles by the discoveries of\r\nProfessor Mitscherlich at Berlin, who ascertained that the composition\r\nof the minerals which had appeared so variable was governed by a\r\ngeneral law, to which he gave the name of _isomorphism_ (from _ isos,_\r\nequal, and _morphe,_ form). According to this law, the ingredients of a\r\ngiven species of mineral are not absolutely fixed as to their kind and\r\nquality; but one ingredient may be replaced by an equivalent portion of\r\nsome analogous ingredient. Thus, in augite, the lime may be in part\r\nreplaced by portions of protoxide of iron, or of manganese, while the\r\nform of the crystal, and the angle of its cleavage planes, remain the\r\nsame. These vicarious substitutions, however, of particular elements\r\ncannot exceed certain defined limits.\r\n\r\nBasaltic Rocks.—The two principal families of trappean or volcanic\r\nrocks are the basalts and the trachytes, which differ chiefly from each\r\nother in the quantity of silica which they contain. The basaltic rocks\r\nare comparatively poor in silica, containing less than 50 per cent of\r\nthat mineral, and none in a pure state or as free quartz, apart from\r\nthe rest of the matrix. They contain a larger proportion of lime and\r\nmagnesia than the trachytes, so that they are heavier, independently of\r\nthe frequent presence of the oxides of iron which in some cases forms\r\nmore than a fourth part of the whole mass. Abich has, therefore,\r\nproposed that we should weigh these rocks, in order to appreciate their\r\ncomposition in cases where it is impossible to separate their component\r\nminerals. Thus, basalt from Staffa, containing 47·80 per cent of\r\nsilica, has a specific gravity of 2·95; whereas trachyte, which has 66\r\nper cent of silica, has a specific gravity of only 2·68; trachytic\r\nporphyry, containing 69 per cent of silica, a specific gravity of only\r\n2·58. If we then take a rock of intermediate composition, such as that\r\nprevailing in the Peak of Teneriffe, which Abich calls\r\nTrachyte-dolerite, its proportion of silica being intermediate, or 58\r\nper cent, it weighs 2·78, or more than trachyte, and less than\r\nbasalt.[4]\r\n\r\n_Basalt._—The different varieties of this rock are distinguished by the\r\nnames of basalts, anamezites, and dolerites, names which, however, only\r\ndenote differences in texture without implying any difference in\r\nmineral or chemical composition: the term _Basalt_ being used only when\r\nthe rock is compact, amorphous, and often semi-vitreous in texture, and\r\nwhen it breaks with a perfect conchoidal fracture; when, however, it is\r\nuniformly crystalline in appearance, yet very close-grained, the name _\r\nAnamesite_ (from _anamesos,_ intermediate) is employed, but if the rock\r\nbe so coarsely crystallised that its different mineral constituents can\r\nbe easily recognised by the eye, it is called _ Dolerite_ (from\r\n_doleros,_ deceitful), in allusion to the difficulty of distinguishing\r\nit from some of the rocks known as Plutonic.\r\n\r\n_Melaphyre_ is often quite undistinguishable in external appearance\r\nfrom basalt, for although rarely so heavy, dark-coloured, or compact,\r\nit may present at times all these varieties of texture. Both these\r\nrocks are composed of triclinic feldspar and augite with more or less\r\nolivine, magnetic or titaniferous oxide of iron, and usually a little\r\nnepheline, leucite, and apatite; basalt usually contains considerably\r\nmore olivine than melaphyre, but chemically they are closely allied,\r\nalthough the melaphyres usually contain more silica and alumina, with\r\nless oxides of iron, lime, and magnesia, than the basalts. The Rowley\r\nHills in Staffordshire, commonly known as Rowley Ragstone, are\r\nmelaphyre.\r\n\r\n_Greenstone._—This name has usually been extended to all granular\r\nmixtures, whether of hornblende and feldspar, or of augite and\r\nfeldspar. The term _diorite_ has been applied exclusively to compounds\r\nof hornblende and triclinic feldspar. _ Labrador-rock_ is a term used\r\nfor a compound of labradorite or labrador-feldspar and hypersthene;\r\nwhen the hypersthene predominates it is sometimes known under the name\r\nof _ Hypersthene-rock._ _Gabbro_ and _Diabase_ are rocks mainly\r\ncomposed of triclinic feldspars and diallage. All these rocks become\r\nsometimes very crystalline, and help to connect the volcanic with the\r\nPlutonic formations, which will be treated of in Chapter XXXI.\r\n\r\nTrachytic Rocks.—The name trachyte (from [**Greek]_ trachus,_ rough)\r\nwas originally given to a coarse granular feldspathic rock which was\r\nrough and gritty to the touch. The term was subsequently made to\r\ninclude other rocks, such as clinkstone and obsidian, which have the\r\nsame mineral composition, but to which, owing to their different\r\ntexture, the word in its original meaning would not apply. The\r\nfeldspars which occur in Trachytic rocks are invariably those which\r\ncontain the largest proportion of silica, or from 60 to 70 per cent of\r\nthat mineral. Through the base are usually disseminated crystals of\r\nglassy feldspar, mica, and sometimes hornblende. Although quartz is not\r\na necessary ingredient in the composition of this rock, it is very\r\nfrequently present, and the quartz trachytes are very largely developed\r\nin many volcanic districts. In this respect the trachytes differ\r\nentirely from the members of the Basaltic family, and are more nearly\r\nallied to the granites.\r\n\r\n_Obsidian._—Obsidian, Pitchstone, and Pearlstone are only different\r\nforms of a volcanic glass produced by the fusion of trachytic rocks.\r\nThe distinction between them is caused by different rates of cooling\r\nfrom the melted state, as has been proved by experiment. Obsidian is of\r\na black or ash-grey colour, and though opaque in mass is transparent in\r\nthin edges.\r\n\r\n_Clinkstone or Phonolite._—Among the rocks of the trachytic family, or\r\nthose in which the feldspars are rich in silica, that termed Clinkstone\r\nor Phonolite is conspicuous by its fissile structure, and its tendency\r\nto lamination, which is such as sometimes to render it useful as\r\nroofing-slate. It rings when struck with the hammer, whence its name;\r\nis compact, and usually of a greyish blue or brownish colour; is\r\nvariable in composition, but almost entirely composed of feldspar. When\r\nit contains disseminated crystals of feldspar, it is called _Clinkstone\r\nporphyry._\r\n\r\nVolcanic Rocks distinguished by special Forms of Structure.—Many\r\nvolcanic rocks are commonly spoken of under names denoting structure\r\nalone, which must not be taken to imply that they are distinct rocks,\r\ni.e., that they differ from one another either in mineral or chemical\r\ncomposition. Thus the terms Trachytic porphyry, Trachytic tuff, etc.,\r\nmerely refer to the same rock under different conditions of mechanical\r\naggregation or crystalline development which would be more correctly\r\nexpressed by the use of the adjective, as porphyritic trachyte, etc.,\r\nbut as these terms are so commonly employed it is considered advisable\r\nto direct the student’s attention to them.\r\n\r\nFig. 586: Porphyry. White crystals of feldspar in a dark base of\r\nhornblende and feldspar.\r\n_Porphyry_ is one of this class, and very characteristic of the\r\nvolcanic formations. When distinct crystals of one or more minerals are\r\nscattered through an earthy or compact base, the rock is termed a\r\nporphyry (see Fig. 586). Thus trachyte is usually porphyritic; for in\r\nit, as in many modern lavas, there are crystals of feldspar; but in\r\nsome porphyries the crystals are of augite, olivine, or other minerals.\r\nIf the base be greenstone, basalt, or pitchstone, the rock may be\r\ndenominated greenstone-porphyry, pitchstone-porphyry, and so forth. The\r\nold classical type of this form of rock is the red porphyry of Egypt,\r\nor the well-known “Rosso antico.” It consists, according to Delesse, of\r\na red feldspathic base in which are disseminated rose-coloured crystals\r\nof the feldspar called oligoclase, with some plates of blackish\r\nhornblende and grains of oxide of iron (iron-glance). _ Red\r\nquartziferous porphyry_ is a much more siliceous rock, containing about\r\n70 or 80 per cent of silex, while that of Egypt has only 62 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Amygdaloid._—This is also another form of igneous rock, admitting of\r\nevery variety of composition. It comprehends any rock in which round or\r\nalmond-shaped nodules of some mineral, such as agate, chalcedony,\r\ncalcareous spar, or zeolite, are scattered through a base of wacke,\r\nbasalt, greenstone, or other kind of trap. It derives its name from the\r\nGreek word _amygdalon,_ an almond. The origin of this structure cannot\r\nbe doubted, for we may trace the process of its formation in modern\r\nlavas. Small pores or cells are caused by bubbles of steam and gas\r\nconfined in the melted matter. After or during consolidation, these\r\nempty spaces are gradually filled up by matter separating from the\r\nmass, or infiltered by water permeating the rock. As these bubbles have\r\nbeen sometimes lengthened by the flow of the lava before it finally\r\ncooled, the contents of such cavities have the form of almonds. In some\r\nof the amygdaloidal traps of Scotland, where the nodules have\r\ndecomposed, the empty cells are seen to have a glazed or vitreous\r\ncoating, and in this respect exactly resemble scoriaceous lavas, or the\r\nslags of furnaces.\r\n\r\nFig. 587: Scoriaceous lava in part converted into an amygdaloid.\r\nFig. 587 represents a fragment of stone taken from the upper part of a\r\nsheet of basaltic lava in Auvergne. One-half is scoriaceous, the pores\r\nbeing perfectly empty; the other part is amygdaloidal, the pores or\r\ncells being mostly filled up with carbonate of lime, forming white\r\nkernels.\r\n\r\n_Lava._—This term has a somewhat vague signification, having been\r\napplied to all melted matter observed to flow in streams from volcanic\r\nvents. When this matter consolidates in the open air, the upper part is\r\nusually scoriaceous, and the mass becomes more and more stony as we\r\ndescend, or in proportion as it has consolidated more slowly and under\r\ngreater pressure. At the bottom, however, of a stream of lava, a small\r\nportion of scoriaceous rock very frequently occurs, formed by the first\r\nthin sheet of liquid matter, which often precedes the main current, and\r\nsolidifies under slight pressure.\r\n\r\nThe more compact lavas are often porphyritic, but even the scoriaceous\r\npart sometimes contains imperfect crystals, which have been derived\r\nfrom some older rocks, in which the crystals pre-existed, but were not\r\nmelted, as being more infusible in their nature. Although melted matter\r\nrising in a crater, and even that which enters a rent on the side of a\r\ncrater, is called lava, yet this term belongs more properly to that\r\nwhich has flowed either in the open air or on the bed of a lake or sea.\r\nIf the same fluid has not reached the surface, but has been merely\r\ninjected into fissures below ground, it is called trap. There is every\r\nvariety of composition in lavas; some are trachytic, as in the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe; a great number are basaltic, as in Vesuvius and Auvergne;\r\nothers are andesitic, as those of Chili; some of the most modern in\r\nVesuvius consist of green augite, and many of those of Etna of augite\r\nand labrador-feldspar.[5]\r\n\r\n_Scoriæ_ and _Pumice_ may next be mentioned, as porous rocks produced\r\nby the action of gases on materials melted by volcanic heat. _Scoriæ_\r\nare usually of a reddish-brown and black colour, and are the cinders\r\nand slags of basaltic or augitic lavas. _Pumice_ is a light, spongy,\r\nfibrous substance, produced by the action of gases on trachytic and\r\nother lavas; the relation, however, of its origin to the composition of\r\nlava is not yet well understood. Von Buch says that it never occurs\r\nwhere only labrador-feldspar is present.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic Ash or Tuff, Trap Tuff._—Small angular fragments of the\r\nscoriæ and pumice, above-mentioned, and the dust of the same, produced\r\nby volcanic explosions, form the tuffs which abound in all regions of\r\nactive volcanoes, where showers of these materials, together with small\r\npieces of other rocks ejected from the crater, and more or less burnt,\r\nfall down upon the land or into the sea. Here they often become mingled\r\nwith shells, and are stratified. Such tuffs are sometimes bound\r\ntogether by a calcareous cement, and form a stone susceptible of a\r\nbeautiful polish. But even when little or no lime is present, there is\r\na great tendency in the materials of ordinary tuffs to cohere together.\r\nThe term _ volcanic ash_ has been much used for rocks of all ages\r\nsupposed to have been derived from matter ejected in a melted state\r\nfrom volcanic orifices. We meet occasionally with extremely compact\r\nbeds of volcanic materials, interstratified with fossiliferous rocks.\r\nThese may sometimes be tuffs, although their density or compactness is\r\nsuch as the cause them to resemble many of those kinds of trap which\r\nare found in ordinary dikes.\r\n\r\n_Wacke_ is a name given to a decomposed state of various trap rocks of\r\nthe basaltic family, or those which are poor in silica. It resembles\r\nclay of a yellowish or brown colour, and passes gradually from the soft\r\nstate to the hard dolerite, greenstone, or other trap rock from which\r\nit has been derived.\r\n\r\n_Agglomerate._—In the neighbourhood of volcanic vents, we frequently\r\nobserve accumulations of angular fragments of rocks formed during\r\neruptions by the explosive action of steam, which shatters the\r\nsubjacent stony formations, and hurls them up into the air. They then\r\nfall in showers around the cone or crater, or may be spread for some\r\ndistance over the surrounding country. The fragments consist usually of\r\ndifferent varieties of scoriaceous and compact lavas; but other kinds\r\nof rock, such as granite or even fossiliferous limestones, may be\r\nintermixed; in short, any substance through which the expansive gases\r\nhave forced their way. The dispersion of such materials may be aided by\r\nthe wind, as it varies in direction or intensity, and by the slope of\r\nthe cone down which they roll, or by floods of rain, which often\r\naccompany eruptions. But if the power of running water, or of the waves\r\nand currents of the sea, be sufficient to carry the fragments to a\r\ndistance, it can scarcely fail to wear off their angles, and the\r\nformation then becomes a _conglomerate._ If occasionally globular\r\npieces of scoriæ abound in an agglomerate, they may not owe their round\r\nform to attrition. When all the angular fragments are of volcanic rocks\r\nthe mass is usually termed a volcanic breccia.\r\n\r\n_Laterite_ is a red or brick-like rock composed of silicate of alumina\r\nand oxide of iron. The red layers called “ochre beds,” dividing the\r\nlavas of the Giant’s Causeway, are laterites. These were found by\r\nDelesse to be trap impregnated with the red oxide of iron, and in part\r\nreduced to kaolin. When still more decomposed, they were found to be\r\nclay coloured by red ochre. As two of the lavas of the Giant’s Causeway\r\nare parted by a bed of lignite, it is not improbable that the layers of\r\nlaterite seen in the Antrim cliffs resulted from atmospheric\r\ndecomposition. In Madeira and the Canary Islands streams of lava of\r\nsubaërial origin are often divided by red bands of laterite, probably\r\nancient soils formed by the decomposition of the surfaces of\r\nlava-currents, many of these soils having been coloured red in the\r\natmosphere by oxide of iron, others burnt into a red brick by the\r\noverflowing of heated lavas. These red bands are sometimes prismatic,\r\nthe small prisms being at right angles to the sheets of lava. Red clay\r\nor red marl, formed as above stated by the disintegration of lava,\r\nscoriæ, or tuff, has often accumulated to a great thickness in the\r\nvalleys of Madeira, being washed into them by alluvial action; and some\r\nof the thick beds of laterite in India may have had a similar origin.\r\nIn India, however, especially in the Deccan, the term “laterite” seems\r\nto have been used too vaguely to answer the above definition. The\r\nvegetable soil in the gardens of the suburbs of Catania which was\r\noverflowed by the lava of 1669 was turned or burnt into a layer of red\r\nbrick-coloured stone, or in other words, into laterite, which may now\r\nbe seen supporting the old lava-current.\r\n\r\nColumnar and Globular Structure.—One of the characteristic forms of\r\nvolcanic rocks, especially of basalt, is the columnar, where large\r\nmasses are divided into regular prisms, sometimes easily separable, but\r\nin other cases adhering firmly together. The columns vary, in the\r\nnumber of angles, from three to twelve; but they have most commonly\r\nfrom five to seven sides. They are often divided transversely, at\r\nnearly equal distances, like the joints in a vertebral column, as in\r\nthe Giant’s Causeway, in Ireland. They vary exceedingly in respect to\r\nlength and diameter. Dr. MacCulloch mentions some in Skye which are\r\nabout 400 feet long; others, in Morven, not exceeding an inch. In\r\nregard to diameter, those of Ailsa measure nine feet, and those of\r\nMorven an inch or less.[6] They are usually straight, but sometimes\r\ncurved; and examples of both these occur in the island of Staffa. In a\r\nhorizontal bed or sheet of trap the columns are vertical; in a vertical\r\ndike they are horizontal.\r\n\r\nFig. 588: Lava of La Coupe d’Ayzac, near Antraigue, in the Department\r\nof Ardêche.\r\n\r\nIt being assumed that columnar trap has consolidated from a fluid\r\nstate, the prisms are said to be always at right angles to the _cooling\r\nsurfaces._ If these surfaces, therefore, instead of being either\r\nperpendicular or horizontal, are curved, the columns ought to be\r\ninclined at every angle to the horizon; and there is a beautiful\r\nexemplification of this phenomenon in one of the valleys of the\r\nVivarais, a mountainous district in the South of France, where, in the\r\nmidst of a region of gneiss, a geologist encounters unexpectedly\r\nseveral volcanic cones of loose sand and scoriæ. From the crater of one\r\nof these cones, called La Coupe d’Ayzac, a stream of lava has descended\r\nand occupied the bottom of a narrow valley, except at those points\r\nwhere the river Volant, or the torrents which join it, have cut away\r\nportions of the solid lava. Fig. 588 represents the remnant of the lava\r\nat one of these points. It is clear that the lava once filled the whole\r\nvalley up to the dotted line _d a_; but the river has gradually swept\r\naway all below that line, while the tributary torrent has laid open a\r\ntransverse section; by which we perceive, in the first place, that the\r\nlava is composed, as usual in this country, of three parts: the\r\nuppermost, at _a,_ being scoriaceous, the second _b,_ presenting\r\nirregular prisms; and the third, _c,_ with regular columns, which are\r\nvertical on the banks of the Volant, where they rest on a horizontal\r\nbase of gneiss, but which are inclined at an angle of 45°, at _g,_ and\r\nare nearly horizontal at _f,_ their position having been everywhere\r\ndetermined, according to the law before mentioned, by the form of the\r\noriginal valley.\r\n\r\nFig. 589: Columnar basalt in the Vicentin.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 589, a view is given of some of the inclined and curved columns\r\nwhich present themselves on the sides of the valleys in the hilly\r\nregion north of Vicenza, in Italy, and at the foot of the higher\r\nAlps.[7] Unlike those of the Vivarais, last mentioned, the basalt of\r\nthis country was evidently submarine, and the present valleys have\r\nsince been hollowed out by denudation.\r\n\r\nThe columnar structure is by no means peculiar to the trap rocks in\r\nwhich augite abounds; it is also observed in trachyte, and other\r\nfeldspathic rocks of the igneous class, although in these it is rarely\r\nexhibited in such regular polygonal forms. It has been already stated\r\nthat basaltic columns are often divided by cross-joints. Sometimes each\r\nsegment, instead of an angular, assumes a spheroidal form, so that a\r\npillar is made up of a pile of balls, usually flattened, as in the\r\nCheese-grotto at Bertrich-Baden, in the Eifel, near the Moselle (Fig.\r\n590). The basalt there is part of a small stream of lava, from 30 to 40\r\nfeet thick, which has proceeded from one of several volcanic craters,\r\nstill extant, on the neighbouring heights.\r\n\r\nFig. 590: Basaltic pillars of Käsegrotte, Bertrich-Baden, half-way\r\nbetween Trèves and Coblenz.\r\n\r\nIn some masses of decomposing greenstone, basalt, and other trap rocks,\r\nthe globular structure is so conspicuous that the rock has the\r\nappearance of a heap of large cannon balls. According to M. Delesse,\r\nthe centre of each spheroid has been a centre of crystallisation,\r\naround which the different minerals of the rock arranged themselves\r\nsymmetrically during the process of cooling. But it was also, he says,\r\na centre of contraction, produced by the same cooling, the globular\r\nform, therefore, of such spheroids being the combined result of\r\ncrystallisation and contraction.[8]\r\n\r\nFig. 591: Globiform pitchstone. Chiaja di Luna, Isle of Ponza.\r\n\r\nMr. Scrope gives as an illustration of this structure a resinous\r\ntrachyte or pitchstone-porphyry in one of the Ponza islands, which rise\r\nfrom the Mediterranean, off the coast of Terracina and Gaeta. The\r\nglobes vary from a few inches to three feet in diameter, and are of an\r\nellipsoidal form (see Fig. 591). The whole rock is in a state of\r\ndecomposition, “and when the balls,” says Mr. Scrope, “have been\r\nexposed a short time to the weather, they scale off at a touch into\r\nnumerous concentric coats, like those of a bulbous root, inclosing a\r\ncompact nucleus. The laminæ of this nucleus have not been so much\r\nloosened by decomposition; but the application of a ruder blow will\r\nproduce a still further exfoliation.”[9]\r\n\r\nFig. 592: Dike in valley, near Brazen Head, Madeira. (From a drawing of\r\nCaptain Basil Hall, R.N.)\r\nVolcanic or Trap Dikes.—The leading varieties of the trappean\r\nrocks—basalt, greenstone, trachyte, and the rest—are found sometimes in\r\ndikes penetrating stratified and unstratified formations, sometimes in\r\nshapeless masses protruding through or overlying them, or in horizontal\r\nsheets intercalated between strata. Fissures have already been spoken\r\nof as occurring in all kinds of rocks, some a few feet, others many\r\nyards in width, and often filled up with earth or angular pieces of\r\nstone, or with sand and pebbles. Instead of such materials, suppose a\r\nquantity of melted stone to be driven or injected into an open rent,\r\nand there consolidated, we have then a tabular mass resembling a wall,\r\nand called a trap dike. It is not uncommon to find such dikes passing\r\nthrough strata of soft materials, such as tuff, scoriæ, or shale,\r\nwhich, being more perishable than the trap, are often washed away by\r\nthe sea, rivers, or rain, in which case the dike stands prominently out\r\nin the face of precipices, or on the level surface of a country (see\r\nFig. 592).\r\n\r\nIn the islands of Arran and Skye, and in other parts of Scotland, where\r\nsandstone, conglomerate, and other hard rocks are traversed by dikes of\r\ntrap, the converse of the above phenomenon is seen. The dike, having\r\ndecomposed more rapidly than the containing rock, has once more left\r\nopen the original fissure, often for a distance of many yards inland\r\nfrom the sea-coast. There is yet another case, by no means uncommon in\r\nArran and other parts of Scotland, where the strata in contact with the\r\ndike, and for a certain distance from it, have been hardened, so as to\r\nresist the action of the weather more than the dike itself, or the\r\nsurrounding rocks. When this happens, two parallel walls of indurated\r\nstrata are seen protruding above the general level of the country and\r\nfollowing the course of the dike. In Fig. 593, a ground plan is given\r\nof a ramifying dike of greenstone, which I observed cutting through\r\nsandstone on the beach near Kildonan Castle, in Arran. The larger\r\nbranch varies from five to seven feet in width, which will afford a\r\nscale of measurement for the whole.\r\n\r\nFig. 593: Ground-plan of greenstone dikes traversing sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn the Hebrides and other countries, the same masses of trap which\r\noccupy the surface of the country far and wide, concealing the\r\nsubjacent stratified rocks, are seen also in the sea-cliffs, prolonged\r\ndownward in veins or dikes, which probably unite with other masses of\r\nigneous rock at a greater depth. The largest of the dikes represented\r\nin Fig. 594, and which are seen in part of the coast of Skye, is no\r\nless than 100 feet in width.\r\n\r\nFig. 594: Trap dividing and covering sandstone near Suishnish, in Skye.\r\n\r\nEvery variety of trap-rock is sometimes found in dikes, as basalt,\r\ngreenstone, feldspar-porphyry, and trachyte. The amygdaloidal traps\r\nalso occur, though more rarely, and even tuff and breccia, for the\r\nmaterials of these last may be washed down into open fissures at the\r\nbottom of the sea, or during eruption on the land may be showered into\r\nthem from the air. Some dikes of trap may be followed for leagues\r\nuninterruptedly in nearly a straight direction, as in the north of\r\nEngland, showing that the fissures which they fill must have been of\r\nextraordinary length.\r\n\r\nRocks altered by Volcanic Dikes.—After these remarks on the form and\r\ncomposition of dikes themselves, I shall describe the alterations which\r\nthey sometimes produce in the rocks in contact with them. The changes\r\nare usually such as the heat of melted matter and of the entangled\r\nsteam and gases might be expected to cause.\r\n\r\n_Plas-Newydd: Dike cutting through Shale._—A striking example, near\r\nPlas-Newydd, in Anglesea, has been described by Professor Henslow.[10]\r\nThe dike is 134 feet wide, and consists of a rock which is a compound\r\nof feldspar and augite (dolerite of some authors). Strata of shale and\r\nargillaceous limestone, through which it cuts perpendicularly, are\r\naltered to a distance of 30, or even, in some places, of 35 feet from\r\nthe edge of the dike. The shale, as it approaches the trap, becomes\r\ngradually more compact, and is most indurated where nearest the\r\njunction. Here it loses part of its schistose structure, but the\r\nseparation into parallel layers is still discernible. In several places\r\nthe shale is converted into hard porcelanous jasper. In the most\r\nhardened part of the mass the fossil shells, principally _Producti,_\r\nare nearly obliterated; yet even here their impressions may frequently\r\nbe traced. The argillaceous limestone undergoes analogous mutations,\r\nlosing its earthy texture as it approaches the dike, and becoming\r\ngranular and crystalline. But the most extraordinary phenomenon is the\r\nappearance in the shale of numerous crystals of analcime and garnet,\r\nwhich are distinctly confined to those portions of the rock affected by\r\nthe dike.[11] Some garnets contain as much as 20 per cent of lime,\r\nwhich they may have derived from the decomposition of the fossil shells\r\nor _Producti._ The same mineral has been observed, under very analogous\r\ncircumstances, in High Teesdale, by Professor Sedgwick, where it also\r\noccurs in shale and limestone, altered by basalt.[12]\r\n\r\n_Antrim: Dike cutting through Chalk._—In several parts of the county of\r\nAntrim, in the north of Ireland, chalk with flints is traversed by\r\nbasaltic dikes. The chalk is there converted into granular marble near\r\nthe basalt, the change sometimes extending eight or ten feet from the\r\nwall of the dike, being greatest near the point of contact, and thence\r\ngradually decreasing till it becomes evanescent. “The extreme effect,”\r\nsays Dr. Berger, “presents a dark brown crystalline limestone, the\r\ncrystals running in flakes as large as those of coarse primitive\r\n(_metamorphic_) limestone; the next state is saccharine, then fine\r\ngrained and arenaceous; a compact variety, having a porcelanous aspect\r\nand a bluish-grey colour, succeeds: this, towards the outer edge,\r\nbecomes yellowish-white, and insensibly graduates into the unaltered\r\nchalk. The flints in the altered chalk usually assume a grey yellowish\r\ncolour.”[13] All traces of organic remains are effaced in that part of\r\nthe limestone which is most crystalline.\r\n\r\nFig. 595: Basaltic dikes in chalk in Island of Rathlin, Antrim.\r\nGround-plan as seen on the beach. Fig. 595: Basaltic dikes in chalk in\r\nIsland of Rathlin, Antrim. Ground-plan as seen on the beach. (Conybeare\r\nand Buckland[14])\r\n\r\nFig. 595 represents three basaltic dikes traversing the chalk, all\r\nwithin the distance of 90 feet. The chalk contiguous to the two outer\r\ndikes is converted into a finely granular marble, _m, m,_ as are the\r\nwhole of the masses between the outer dikes and the central one. The\r\nentire contrast in the composition and colour of the intrusive and\r\ninvaded rocks, in these cases, renders the phenomena peculiarly clear\r\nand interesting. Another of the dikes of the north-east of Ireland has\r\nconverted a mass of red sandstone into hornstone. By another, the shale\r\nof the coal-measures has been indurated, assuming the character of\r\nflinty slate; and in another place the slate-clay of the lias has been\r\nchanged into flinty slate, which still retains numerous impressions of\r\nammonites.[15]\r\n\r\nIt might have been anticipated that beds of coal would, from their\r\ncombustible nature, be affected in an extraordinary degree by the\r\ncontact of melted rock. Accordingly, one of the greenstone dikes of\r\nAntrim, on passing through a bed of coal, reduces it to a cinder for\r\nthe space of nine feet on each side. At Cockfield Fell, in the north of\r\nEngland, a similar change is observed. Specimens taken at the distance\r\nof about thirty yards from the trap are not distinguishable from\r\nordinary pit-coal; those nearer the dike are like cinders, and have all\r\nthe character of coke; while those close to it are converted into a\r\nsubstance resembling soot.[16]\r\n\r\nIt is by no means uncommon to meet with the same rocks, even in the\r\nsame districts, absolutely unchanged in the proximity of volcanic\r\ndikes. This great inequality in the effects of the igneous rocks may\r\noften arise from an original difference in their temperature, and in\r\nthat of the entangled gases, such as is ascertained to prevail in\r\ndifferent lavas, or in the same lava near its source and at a distance\r\nfrom it. The power also of the invaded rocks to conduct heat may vary,\r\naccording to their composition, structure, and the fractures which they\r\nmay have experienced, and perhaps, also, according to the quantity of\r\nwater (so capable of being heated) which they contain. It must happen\r\nin some cases that the component materials are mixed in such\r\nproportions as to prepare them readily to enter into chemical union,\r\nand form new minerals; while in other cases the mass may be more\r\nhomogeneous, or the proportions less adapted for such union.\r\n\r\nWe must also take into consideration, that one fissure may be simply\r\nfilled with lava, which may begin to cool from the first; whereas in\r\nother cases the fissure may give passage to a current of melted matter,\r\nwhich may ascend for days or months, feeding streams which are\r\noverflowing the country above, or being ejected in the shape of scoriæ\r\nfrom some crater. If the walls of a rent, moreover, are heated by hot\r\nvapour before the lava rises, as we know may happen on the flanks of a\r\nvolcano, the additional heat supplied by the dike and its gases will\r\nact more powerfully.\r\n\r\nIntrusion of Trap between Strata.—Masses of trap are not unfrequently\r\nmet with intercalated between strata, and maintaining their parallelism\r\nto the planes of stratification throughout large areas. They must in\r\nsome places have forced their way laterally between the divisions of\r\nthe strata, a direction in which there would be the least resistance to\r\nan advancing fluid, if no vertical rents communicated with the surface,\r\nand a powerful hydrostatic pressure were caused by gases propelling the\r\nlava upward.\r\n\r\nRelation of Trappean Rocks to the Products of active Volcanoes.—When we\r\nreflect on the changes above described in the strata near their contact\r\nwith trap dikes, and consider how complete is the analogy or often\r\nidentity in composition and structure of the rocks called trappean and\r\nthe lavas of active volcanoes, it seems difficult at first to\r\nunderstand how so much doubt could have prevailed for half a century as\r\nto whether trap was of igneous or aqueous origin. To a certain extent,\r\nhowever, there was a real distinction between the trappean formations\r\nand those to which the term volcanic was almost exclusively confined. A\r\nlarge portion of the trappean rocks first studied in the north of\r\nGermany, and in Norway, France, Scotland, and other countries, were\r\nsuch as had been formed entirely under water, or had been injected into\r\nfissures and intruded between strata, and which had never flowed out in\r\nthe air, or over the bottom of a shallow sea. When these products,\r\ntherefore, of submarine or subterranean igneous action were contrasted\r\nwith loose cones of scoriæ, tuff, and lava, or with narrow streams of\r\nlava in great part scoriaceous and porous, such as were observed to\r\nhave proceeded from Vesuvius and Etna, the resemblance seemed remote\r\nand equivocal. It was, in truth, like comparing the roots of a tree\r\nwith its leaves and branches, which, although the belong to the same\r\nplant, differ in form, texture, colour, mode of growth, and position.\r\nThe external cone, with its loose ashes and porous lava, may be likened\r\nto the light foliage and branches, and the rocks concealed far below,\r\nto the roots. But it is not enough to say of the volcano,\r\n\r\n                  “Quantum vertice in auras\r\n     Ætherias, tantum radice in Tartara tendit,”\r\n\r\nfor its roots do literally reach downward to Tartarus, or to the\r\nregions of subterranean fire; and what is concealed far below is\r\nprobably always more important in volume and extent than what is\r\nvisible above ground.\r\n\r\nFig. 596: Strata intercepted by a trap dike, and covered with alluvium.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated how frequently dense masses of strata have been\r\nremoved by denudation from wide areas (see Chapter VI); and this fact\r\nprepares us to expect a similar destruction of whatever may once have\r\nformed the uppermost part of ancient submarine or subaërial volcanoes,\r\nmore especially as those superficial parts are always of the lightest\r\nand most perishable materials. The abrupt manner in which dikes of trap\r\nusually terminate at the surface (see Fig. 596), and the water-worn\r\npebbles of trap in the alluvium which covers the dike, prove\r\nincontestably that whatever was uppermost in these formations has been\r\nswept away. It is easy, therefore, to conceive that what is gone in\r\nregions of trap may have corresponded to what is now visible in active\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nAs to the absence of porosity in the trappean formations, the\r\nappearances are in a great degree deceptive, for all amygdaloids are,\r\nas already explained, porous rocks, into the cells of which mineral\r\nmatter such as silex, carbonate of lime, and other ingredients, have\r\nbeen subsequently introduced (see p. 507); sometimes, perhaps, by\r\nsecretion during the cooling and consolidation of lavas. In the Little\r\nCumbray, one of the Western Islands, near Arran, the amygdaloid\r\nsometimes contains elongated cavities filled with brown spar; and when\r\nthe nodules have been washed out, the interior of the cavities is\r\nglazed with the vitreous varnish so characteristic of the pores of\r\nslaggy lavas. Even in some parts of this rock which are excluded from\r\nair and water, the cells are empty, and seem to have always remained in\r\nthis state, and are therefore undistinguishable from some modern\r\nlavas.[17]\r\n\r\nDr. MacCulloch, after examining with great attention these and the\r\nother igneous rocks of Scotland, observes, “that it is a mere dispute\r\nabout terms, to refuse to the ancient eruptions of trap the name of\r\nsubmarine volcanoes; for they are such in every essential point,\r\nalthough they no longer eject fire and smoke.” The same author also\r\nconsiders it not improbable that some of the volcanic rocks of the same\r\ncountry may have been poured out in the open air.[18]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in the following chapters that in the earth’s crust\r\nthere are volcanic tuffs of all ages, containing marine shells, which\r\nbear witness to eruptions at many successive geological periods. These\r\ntuffs, and the associated trappean rocks, must not be compared to lava\r\nand scoriæ which had cooled in the open air. Their counterparts must be\r\nsought in the products of modern submarine volcanic eruptions. If it be\r\nobjected that we have no opportunity of studying these last, it may be\r\nanswered, that subterranean movements have caused, almost everywhere in\r\nregions of active volcanoes, great changes in the relative level of\r\nland and sea, in times comparatively modern, so as to expose to view\r\nthe effects of volcanic operations at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n [1] Principles, vol. ii, pp. 56 and 145.\r\n\r\n [2] Memoir on Mount Etna, Phil.

The tests of relative age in this class of rocks are four:\r\nfirst, superposition and intrusion, with or without alteration of the\r\nrocks in contact; second, organic remains; third, mineral characters;\r\nfourth, included fragments of older rocks.\r\n\r\nBesides these four tests it may be said, in a general way, that\r\nvolcanic rocks of Primary or Palæozoic antiquity differ from those of\r\nthe Secondary or Mesozoic age, and these again from the Tertiary and\r\nRecent. Not, perhaps, that they differed originally in a greater degree\r\nthan the modern volcanic rocks of one region, such as that of the\r\nAndes, differ from those of another, such as Iceland, but because all\r\nrocks permeated by water, especially if its temperature be high, are\r\nliable to undergo a slow transmutation, even when they do not assume a\r\nnew crystalline form like that of the hypogene rocks.\r\n\r\nAlthough subaërial and submarine denudation, as before stated, remove,\r\nin the course of ages, large portions of the upper or more superficial\r\nproducts of volcanoes, yet these are sometimes preserved by subsidence,\r\nbecoming covered by the sea or by superimposed marine deposits. In this\r\nway they may be protected for ages from the waves of the sea, or the\r\ndestroying action of rivers, while, at the same time, they may not sink\r\nso deep as to be exposed to that Plutonic action (to be spoken of in\r\nChapter XXXI) which would convert them into crystalline rocks. But even\r\nin this case they will not remain unaltered, because they will be\r\npercolated by water often of high temperature, and charged with\r\ncarbonate of lime, silex, iron, and other mineral ingredients, whereby\r\ngradual changes in the constitution of the rocks may be superinduced.\r\nEvery geologist is aware how often silicified trees occur in volcanic\r\ntuffs, the perfect preservation of their internal structure showing\r\nthat they have not decayed before the petrifying material was supplied.\r\n\r\nThe porous and vesicular nature of a large part, both of the basaltic\r\nand trachytic lavas, affords cavities in which silex and carbonate of\r\nlime are readily deposited. Minerals of the zeolite family, the\r\ncomposition of which has already been alluded to, p. 500, occur in\r\namygdaloids and other trap-rocks in great abundance, and Daubrée’s\r\nobservations have proved that they are not always simple deposits of\r\nsubstances held in solution by the percolating waters, being\r\noccasionally products of the chemical action of that water on the rock\r\nthrough which they are filtered, and portions of which are decomposed.\r\nFrom these considerations it follows that the perfect identity of very\r\nancient and very modern volcanic formations is scarcely possible.\r\n\r\nFig. 597: Showing melted matter forced between two strata.\r\n\r\nTests by Superposition.—If a volcanic rock rest upon an aqueous\r\ndeposit, the volcanic must be the newest of the two; but the like rule\r\ndoes not hold good where the aqueous formation rests upon the volcanic,\r\nfor melted matter, rising from below, may penetrate a sedimentary mass\r\nwithout reaching the surface, or may be forced in conformably between\r\ntwo strata, as _ b_ below D in Fig. 597, after which it may cool down\r\nand consolidate. Superposition, therefore, is not of the same value as\r\na test of age in the unstratified volcanic rocks as in fossiliferous\r\nformations. We can only rely implicitly on this test where the volcanic\r\nrocks are contemporaneous, not where they are intrusive. Now, they are\r\nsaid to be contemporaneous if produced by volcanic action which was\r\ngoing on simultaneously with the deposition of the strata with which\r\nthey are associated. Thus in the section at D (Fig. 597), we may\r\nperhaps ascertain that the trap _b_ flowed over the fossiliferous bed\r\n_c,_ and that, after its consolidation, _a_ was deposited upon it, _a_\r\nand _c_ both belonging to the same geological period. But, on the other\r\nhand, we must conclude the trap to be intrusive, if the stratum _a_ be\r\naltered by _b_ at the point of contact, or if, in pursuing _b_ for some\r\ndistance, we find at length that it cuts through the stratum _a,_ and\r\nthen overlies it as at E.\r\n\r\nFig. 598: Section through sedimentary mass with melted matter.\r\nWe may, however, be easily deceived in supposing the volcanic rock to\r\nbe intrusive, when in reality it is contemporaneous; for a sheet of\r\nlava, as it spreads over the bottom of the sea, cannot rest everywhere\r\nupon the same stratum, either because these have been denuded, or\r\nbecause, if newly thrown down, they thin out in certain places, thus\r\nallowing the lava to cross their edges. Besides, the heavy igneous\r\nfluid will often, as it moves along, cut a channel into beds of soft\r\nmud and sand. Suppose the submarine lava F (Fig. 598) to have come in\r\ncontact in this manner with the strata _a, b, c,_ and that after its\r\nconsolidation the strata _d, e_ are thrown down in a nearly horizontal\r\nposition, yet so as to lie unconformably to F, the appearance of\r\nsubsequent intrusion will here be complete, although the trap is in\r\nfact contemporaneous. We must not, therefore, hastily infer that the\r\nrock F is intrusive, unless we find the overlying strata, _d, e,_ to\r\nhave been altered at their junction, as if by heat.\r\n\r\nThe test of age by superposition is strictly applicable to all\r\nstratified volcanic tuffs, according to the rules already explained in\r\nthe case of sedimentary deposits (see p. 124).\r\n\r\nTest of Age by Organic Remains.—We have seen how, in the vicinity of\r\nactive volcanoes, scoriæ, pumice, fine sand, and fragments of rock are\r\nthrown up into the air, and then showered down upon the land, or into\r\nneighbouring lakes or seas. In the tuffs so formed shells, corals, or\r\nany other durable organic bodies which may happen to be strewed over\r\nthe bottom of a lake or sea will be imbedded, and thus continue as\r\npermanent memorials of the geological period when the volcanic eruption\r\noccurred. Tufaceous strata thus formed in the neighbourhood of\r\nVesuvius, Etna, Stromboli, and other volcanoes now in islands or near\r\nthe sea, may give information of the relative age of these tuffs at\r\nsome remote future period when the fires of these mountains are\r\nextinguished. By evidence of this kind we can establish a coincidence\r\nin age between volcanic rocks and the different primary, secondary, and\r\ntertiary fossiliferous strata.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs alluded to may not always be marine, but may include, in some\r\nplaces, fresh-water shells; in others, the bones of terrestrial\r\nquadrupeds. The diversity of organic remains in formations of this\r\nnature is perfectly intelligible, if we reflect on the wide dispersion\r\nof ejected matter during late eruptions, such as that of the volcano of\r\nCoseguina, in the province of Nicaragua, January 19, 1835. Hot cinders\r\nand fine scoriæ were then cast up to a vast height, and covered the\r\nground as they fell to the depth of more than ten feet, for a distance\r\nof eight leagues from the crater, in a southerly direction. Birds,\r\ncattle, and wild animals were scorched to death in great numbers, and\r\nburied in ashes. Some volcanic dust fell at Chiapa, upward of 1200\r\nmiles, not to leeward of the volcano, as might have been anticipated,\r\nbut to windward, a striking proof of a counter-current in the upper\r\nregion of the atmosphere; and some on Jamaica, about 700 miles distant\r\nto the north-east. In the sea, also, at the distance of 1100 miles from\r\nthe point of eruption, Captain Eden of the “Conway” sailed 40 miles\r\nthrough floating pumice, among which were some pieces of considerable\r\nsize.[1]\r\n\r\nTest of Age by Mineral Composition.—As sediment of homogeneous\r\ncomposition, when discharged from the mouth of a large river, is often\r\ndeposited simultaneously over a wide space, so a particular kind of\r\nlava flowing from a crater during one eruption may spread over an\r\nextensive area; thus in Iceland, in 1783, the melted matter, pouring\r\nfrom Skaptar Jokul, flowed in streams in opposite directions, and\r\ncaused a continuous mass the extreme points of which were 90 miles\r\ndistant from each other. This enormous current of lava varied in\r\nthickness from 100 feet to 600 feet, and in breadth from that of a\r\nnarrow river gorge to 15 miles.[2] Now, if such a mass should\r\nafterwards be divided into separate fragments by denudation, we might\r\nstill, perhaps, identify the detached portions by their similarity in\r\nmineral composition. Nevertheless, this test will not always avail the\r\ngeologist; for, although there is usually a prevailing character in\r\nlava emitted during the same eruption, and even in the successive\r\ncurrents flowing from the same volcano, still, in many cases, the\r\ndifferent parts even of one lava-stream, or, as before stated, of one\r\ncontinuous mass of trap, vary much in mineral composition and texture.\r\n\r\nIn Auvergne, the Eifel, and other countries where trachyte and basalt\r\nare both present, the trachytic rocks are for the most part older than\r\nthe basaltic. These rocks do, indeed, sometimes alternate partially, as\r\nin the volcano of Mont Dor, in Auvergne; and in Madeira trachytic rocks\r\noverlie an older basaltic series; but the trachyte occupies more\r\ngenerally an inferior position, and is cut through and overflowed by\r\nbasalt. It can by no means be inferred that trachyte predominated at\r\none period of the earth’s history and basalt at another, for we know\r\nthat trachytic lavas have been formed at many successive periods, and\r\nare still emitted from many active craters; but it seems that in each\r\nregion, where a long series of eruptions have occurred, the lavas\r\ncontaining feldspar more rich in silica have been first emitted, and\r\nthe escape of the more augitic kinds has followed. The hypothesis\r\nsuggested by Mr. Scrope may, perhaps, afford a solution of this\r\nproblem. The minerals, he observes, which abound in basalt are of\r\ngreater specific gravity than those composing the feldspathic lavas;\r\nthus, for example, hornblende, augite, and olivine are each more than\r\nthree times the weight of water; whereas common feldspar and albite\r\nhave each scarcely more than 2½ times the specific gravity of water;\r\nand the difference is increased in consequence of there being much more\r\niron in a metallic state in basalt and greenstone than in trachyte and\r\nother allied feldspathic lavas. If, therefore, a large quantity of rock\r\nbe melted up in the bowels of the earth by volcanic heat, the denser\r\ningredients of the boiling fluid may sink to the bottom, and the\r\nlighter remaining above would in that case be first propelled upward to\r\nthe surface by the expansive power of gases. Those materials,\r\ntherefore, which occupy the lowest place in the subterranean reservoir\r\nwill always be emitted last, and take the uppermost place on the\r\nexterior of the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nTest by Included Fragments.—We may sometimes discover the relative age\r\nof two trap-rocks, or of an aqueous deposit and the trap on which it\r\nrests, by finding fragments of one included in the other in cases such\r\nas those before alluded to, where the evidence of superposition alone\r\nwould be insufficient. It is also not uncommon to find a conglomerate\r\nalmost exclusively composed of rolled pebbles of trap, associated with\r\nsome fossiliferous stratified formation in the neighbourhood of massive\r\ntrap. If the pebbles agree generally in mineral character with the\r\nlatter, we are then enabled to determine its relative age by knowing\r\nthat of the fossiliferous strata associated with the conglomerate. The\r\norigin of such conglomerates is explained by observing the shingle\r\nbeaches composed of trap-pebbles in modern volcanoes, as at the base of\r\nEtna.\r\n\r\nRecent and Post-pliocene Volcanic Rocks.—I shall now select examples of\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic rocks of successive geological periods, to\r\nshow that igneous causes have been in activity in all past ages of the\r\nworld. They have been perpetually shifting the places where they have\r\nbroken out at the earth’s surface, and we can sometimes prove that\r\nthose areas which are now the great theatres of volcanic action were in\r\na state of perfect tranquillity at remote geological epochs, and that,\r\non the other hand, in places where at former periods the most violent\r\neruptions took place at the surface and continued for a great length of\r\ntime, there has been an entire suspension of igneous action in\r\nhistorical times, and even, as in the British Isles, throughout a large\r\npart of the antecedent Tertiary Period.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of British examples of volcanic rocks newer than the\r\nUpper Miocene, I may state that in other parts of the world, especially\r\nin those where volcanic eruptions are now taking place from time to\r\ntime, there are tuffs and lavas belonging to that part of the Tertiary\r\nera the antiquity of which is proved by the presence of the bones of\r\nextinct quadrupeds which co-existed with terrestrial, fresh-water, and\r\nmarine mollusca of species still living. One portion of the lavas,\r\ntuffs, and trap-dikes of Etna, Vesuvius, and the island of Ischia has\r\nbeen produced within the historical era; another and a far more\r\nconsiderable part originated at times immediately antecedent, when the\r\nwaters of the Mediterranean were already inhabited by the existing\r\ntestacea, but when certain species of elephant, rhinoceros, and other\r\nquadrupeds now extinct, inhabited Europe.\r\n\r\n_Vesuvius._—I have traced in the “Principles of Geology” the history of\r\nthe changes which the volcanic region of Campania is known to have\r\nundergone during the last 2000 years. The aggregate effect of igneous\r\noperations during that period is far from insignificant, comprising as\r\nit does the formation of the modern cone of Vesuvius since the year 79,\r\nand the production of several minor cones in Ischia, together with that\r\nof Monte Nuovo in the year 1538. Lava-currents have also flowed upon\r\nthe land and along the bottom of the sea—volcanic sand, pumice, and\r\nscoriæ have been showered down so abundantly that whole cities were\r\nburied—tracts of the sea have been filled up or converted into\r\nshoals—and tufaceous sediment has been transported by rivers and\r\nland-floods to the sea. There are also proofs, during the same recent\r\nperiod, of a permanent alteration of the relative levels of the land\r\nand sea in several places, and of the same tract having, near Puzzuoli,\r\nbeen alternately upheaved and depressed to the amount of more than\r\ntwenty feet. In connection with these convulsions, there are found, on\r\nthe shores of the Bay of Baiæ, recent tufaceous strata, filled with\r\narticles fabricated by the hands of man, and mingled with marine\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nIt has also been stated (p. 206), that when we examine this same\r\nregion, it is found to consist largely of tufaceous strata, of a date\r\nanterior to human history or tradition, which are of such thickness as\r\nto constitute hills from 500 to more than 2000 feet in height. Some of\r\nthese strata contain marine shells which are exclusively of living\r\nspecies, others contain a slight mixture, one or two per cent of\r\nspecies not known as living.\r\n\r\nThe ancient part of Vesuvius is called Somma, and consists of the\r\nremains of an older cone which appears to have been partly destroyed by\r\nexplosion. In the great escarpment which this remnant of the ancient\r\nmountain presents towards the modern cone of Vesuvius, there are many\r\ndikes which are for the most part vertical, and traverse the inclined\r\nbeds of lava and scoriæ which were successively superimposed during\r\nthose eruptions by which the old cone was formed. They project in\r\nrelief several inches, or sometimes feet, from the face of the cliff,\r\nbeing extremely compact, and less destructible than the intersected\r\ntuffs and porous lavas. In vertical extent they vary from a few yards\r\nto 500 feet, and in breadth from one to twelve feet. Many of them cut\r\nall the inclined beds in the escarpment of Somma from top to bottom,\r\nothers stop short before they ascend above halfway. In mineral\r\ncomposition they scarcely differ from the lavas of Somma, the rock\r\nconsisting of a base of leucite and augite, through which large\r\ncrystals of augite and some of leucite are scattered.\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable than the usual parallelism of the opposite\r\nsides of the dikes, which correspond almost as regularly as the two\r\nopposite faces of a wall of masonry. This character appears at first\r\nthe more inexplicable, when we consider how jagged and uneven are the\r\nrents caused by earthquakes in masses of heterogeneous composition,\r\nlike those composing the cone of Somma. In explanation of this\r\nphenomenon, M. Necker refers us to Sir W. Hamilton’s account of an\r\neruption of Vesuvius in the year 1779, who records the following fact:\r\n“The lavas, when they either boiled over the crater, or broke out from\r\nthe conical parts of the volcano, constantly formed channels as regular\r\nas if they had been cut by art down the steep part of the mountain; and\r\nwhilst in a state of perfect fusion, continued their course in those\r\nchannels, which were sometimes full to the brim, and at other times\r\nmore or less so, according to the quantity of matter in motion.\r\n\r\n”These channels (says the same observer), I have found, upon\r\nexamination after an eruption, to be in general from two to five or six\r\nfeet wide, and seven or eight feet deep. They were often hid from the\r\nsight by a quantity of scoriæ that had formed a crust over them; and\r\nthe lava, having been conveyed in a covered way for some yards, came\r\nout fresh again into an open channel. After an eruption, I have walked\r\nin some of those subterraneous or covered galleries, which were\r\nexceedingly curious, the sides, top, and bottom _being worn perfectly\r\nsmooth and even_ in most parts by the violence of the currents of the\r\nred-hot lavas which they had conveyed for many weeks successively.” I\r\nwas able to verify this phenomenon in 1858, when a stream of lava\r\nissued from a lateral cone.[3] Now, the walls of a vertical fissure,\r\nthrough which lava has ascended in its way to a volcanic vent, must\r\nhave been exposed to the same erosion as the sides of the channels\r\nbefore adverted to. The prolonged and uniform friction of the heavy\r\nfluid, as it is forced and made to flow upward, cannot fail to wear and\r\nsmooth down the surfaces on which it rubs, and the intense heat must\r\nmelt all such masses as project and obstruct the passage of the\r\nincandescent fluid.\r\n\r\nThe rock composing the dikes both in the modern and ancient part of\r\nVesuvius is far more compact than that of ordinary lava, for the\r\npressure of a column of melted matter in a fissure greatly exceeds that\r\nin an ordinary stream of lava; and pressure checks the expansion of\r\nthose gases which give rise to vesicles in lava. There is a tendency in\r\nalmost all the Vesuvian dikes to divide into horizontal prisms, a\r\nphenomenon in accordance with the formation of vertical columns in\r\nhorizontal beds of lava; for in both cases the divisions which give\r\nrise to the prismatic structure are at right angles to the cooling\r\nsurfaces. (See  p. 510.)\r\n\r\n_Auvergne._—Although the latest eruptions in central France seem to\r\nhave long preceded the historical era, they are so modern as to have a\r\nvery intimate connection with the present superficial outline of the\r\ncountry and with the existing valleys and river-courses. Among a great\r\nnumber of cones with perfect craters, one called the Puy de Tartaret\r\nsent forth a lava-current which can be traced up to its crater, and\r\nwhich flowed for a distance of thirteen miles along the bottom of the\r\npresent valley to the village of Nechers, covering the alluvium of the\r\nold valley in which were preserved the bones of an extinct species of\r\nhorse, and of a lagomys and other quadrupeds all closely allied to\r\nrecent animals, while the associated land-shells were of species now\r\nliving, such as _Cyclostoma elegans, Helix hortensis, H. nemoralis,_\r\n_H. lapicida,_ and _Clausilia rugosa._ That the current which has\r\nissued from the Puy de Tartaret may, nevertheless, be very ancient in\r\nreference to the events of human history, we may conclude, not only\r\nfrom the divergence of the mammiferous fauna from that of our day, but\r\nfrom the fact that a Roman bridge of such form and construction as\r\ncontinued in use only down to the fifth century, but which may be\r\nolder, is now seen at a place about a mile and a half from St.\r\nNectaire. This ancient bridge spans the river Couze with two arches,\r\neach about fourteen feet wide. These arches spring from the lava of\r\nTartaret, on both banks, showing that a ravine precisely like that now\r\nexisting had already been excavated by the river through that lava\r\nthirteen or fourteen centuries ago.\r\n\r\nWhile the river Couze has in most cases, as at the site of this ancient\r\nbridge, been simply able to cut a deep channel through the lava, the\r\nlower portion of which is shown to be columnar, the same torrent has in\r\nother places, where the valley was contracted to a narrow gorge, had\r\npower to remove the entire mass of basaltic rock, causing for a short\r\nspace a complete breach of continuity in the volcanic current. The work\r\nof erosion has been very slow, as the basalt is tough and hard, and one\r\ncolumn after another must have been undermined and reduced to pebbles,\r\nand then to sand. During the time required for this operation, the\r\nperishable cone of Tartaret, occupying the lowest part of the great\r\nvalley descending from Mont Dor (see p. 542), and damming up the river\r\nso as to cause the Lake of Chambon, has stood uninjured, proving that\r\nno great flood or deluge can have passed over this region in the\r\ninterval between the eruption of Tartaret and our own times.\r\n\r\n_Puy de Côme._—The Puy de Côme and its lava-current, near Clermont, may\r\nbe mentioned as another minor volcano of about the same age. This\r\nconical hill rises from the granitic platform, at an angle of between\r\n30° and 40°, to the height of more than 900 feet. Its summit presents\r\ntwo distinct craters, one of them with a vertical depth of 250 feet. A\r\nstream of lava takes its rise at the western base of the hill instead\r\nof issuing from either crater, and descends the granitic slope towards\r\nthe present site of the town of Pont Gibaud. Thence it pours in a broad\r\nsheet down a steep declivity into the valley of the Sioule, filling the\r\nancient river-channel for the distance of more than a mile. The Sioule,\r\nthus dispossessed of its bed, has worked out a fresh one between the\r\nlava and the granite of its western bank; and the excavation has\r\ndisclosed, in one spot, a wall of columnar basalt about fifty feet\r\nhigh.[4]\r\n\r\nThe excavation of the ravine is still in progress, every winter some\r\ncolumns of basalt being undermined and carried down the channel of the\r\nriver, and in the course of a few miles rolled to sand and pebbles.\r\nMeanwhile the cone of Côme remains unimpaired, its loose materials\r\nbeing protected by a dense vegetation, and the hill standing on a ridge\r\nnot commanded by any higher ground, so that no floods of rain-water can\r\ndescend upon it. There is no end to the waste which the hard basalt may\r\nundergo in future, if the physical geography of the country continue\r\nunchanged—no limit to the number of years during which the heap of\r\nincoherent and transportable materials called the Puy de Côme may\r\nremain in an almost stationary condition.\r\n\r\n_Puy de Pariou._—The brim of the crater of the Puy de Pariou, near\r\nClermont, is so sharp, and has been so little blunted by time, that it\r\nscarcely affords room to stand upon. This and other cones in an equally\r\nremarkable state of integrity have stood, I conceive, uninjured, not\r\n_in spite_ of their loose porous nature, as might at first be naturally\r\nsupposed, but in consequence of it. No rills can collect where all the\r\nrain is instantly absorbed by the sand and scoriæ, as is remarkably the\r\ncase on Etna; and nothing but a water-spout breaking directly upon the\r\nPuy de Pariou could carry away a portion of the hill, so long as it is\r\nnot rent or ingulfed by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nNewer Pliocene Volcanic Rocks.—The more ancient portion of Vesuvius and\r\nEtna originated at the close of the Newer Pliocene period, when less\r\nthan ten, sometimes only one, in a hundred of the shells differed from\r\nthose now living. In the case of Etna, it was before stated (p. 205)\r\nthat Post-pliocene formations occur in the neighbourhood of Catania,\r\nwhile the oldest lavas of the great volcano are Pliocene. These last\r\nare seen associated with sedimentary deposits at Trezza and other\r\nplaces on the southern and eastern flanks of the great cone (see p.\r\n205).\r\n\r\n_Cyclopean Islands._—The Cyclopean Islands, called by the Sicilians Dei\r\nFaraglioni, in the sea-cliffs of which these beds of clay, tuff, and\r\nassociated lava are laid open to view, are situated in the Bay of\r\nTrezza, and may be regarded as the extremity of a promontory severed\r\nfrom the main land. Here numerous proofs are seen of submarine\r\neruptions, by which the argillaceous and sandy strata were invaded and\r\ncut through, and tufaceous breccias formed. Inclosed in these breccias\r\nare many angular and hardened fragments of laminated clay in different\r\nstates of alteration by heat, and intermixed with volcanic sands.\r\n\r\nFig. 599: View of the Isle of Cyclops, in the Bay of Trezza.\r\n\r\nThe loftiest of the Cyclopean islets, or rather rocks, is about 200\r\nfeet in height, the summit being formed of a mass of stratified clay,\r\nthe laminæ of which are occasionally subdivided by thin arenaceous\r\nlayers. These strata dip to the N.W., and rest on a mass of columnar\r\nlava (see Fig. 599) in which the tops of the pillars are weathered, and\r\nso rounded as to be often hemispherical.\r\n\r\nFig. 600: Contortions of strata in the largest of the Cyclopean\r\nIslands.\r\nIn some places in the adjoining and largest islet of the group, which\r\nlies to the north-eastward of that represented in Figure 599), the\r\noverlying clay has been greatly altered and hardened by the igneous\r\nrock, and occasionally contorted in the most extraordinary manner; yet\r\nthe lamination has not been obliterated, but, on the contrary, rendered\r\nmuch more conspicuous, by the indurating process.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 600 I have represented a portion of the altered rock, a few\r\nfeet square, where the alternating thin laminæ of sand and clay are\r\ncontorted in a manner often observed in ancient metamorphic schists. A\r\ngreat fissure, running from east to west, nearly divides this larger\r\nisland into two parts, and lays open its internal structure. In the\r\nsection thus exhibited, a dike of lava is seen, first cutting through\r\nan older mass of lava, and then penetrating the superincumbent tertiary\r\nstrata. In one place the lava ramifies and terminates in thin veins,\r\nfrom a few feet to a few inches in thickness (see Fig. 601). The\r\narenaceous laminæ are much hardened at the point of contact, and the\r\nclays are converted into siliceous schist. In this island the altered\r\nrocks assume a honey-comb structure on their weathered surface,\r\nsingularly contrasted with the smooth and even outline which the same\r\nbeds present in their usual soft and yielding state. The pores of the\r\nlava are sometimes coated, or entirely filled with carbonate of lime,\r\nand with a zeolite resembling analcime, which has been called\r\ncyclopite. The latter mineral has also been found in small fissures\r\ntraversing the altered marl, showing that the same cause which\r\nintroduced the minerals into the cavities of the lava, whether we\r\nsuppose sublimation or aqueous infiltration, conveyed it also into the\r\nopen rents of the contiguous sedimentary strata.\r\n\r\nFig. 601: Newer pliocene strata invaded by lava. Isle of Cyclops\r\n(horizontal section).\r\n_Dikes of Palagonia._—Dikes of vesicular and amygdaloidal lava are also\r\nseen traversing marine tuff or peperino, west of Palagonia, some of the\r\npores of the lava being empty, while others are filled with carbonate\r\nof lime. In such cases we may suppose the tuff to have resulted from\r\nshowers of volcanic sand and scoriæ, together with fragments of\r\nlimestone, thrown out by a submarine explosion, similar to that which\r\ngave rise to Graham Island in 1831. When the mass was, to a certain\r\ndegree, consolidated, it may have been rent open, so that the lava\r\nascended through fissures, the walls of which were perfectly even and\r\nparallel. In one case, after the melted matter that filled the rent\r\n(Fig. 602) had cooled down, it must have been fractured and shifted\r\nhorizontally by a lateral movement.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 603, the lava has more the appearance of a vein, which forced\r\nits way through the peperino. It is highly probable that similar\r\nappearances would be seen, if we could examine the floor of the sea in\r\nthat part of the Mediterranean where the waves have recently washed\r\naway the new volcanic island; for when a superincumbent mass of ejected\r\nfragments has been removed by denudation, we may expect to see sections\r\nof dikes traversing tuff, or, in other words, sections of the channels\r\nof communication by which the subterranean lavas reached the surface.\r\n\r\nFigs. 602 and 603: Ground-plan of dikes near Palagonia.\r\n_Madeira._—Although the more ancient portion of the volcanic eruptions\r\nby which the island of Madeira and the neighbouring one of Porto Santo\r\nwere built up occurred, as we shall presently see, in the Upper Miocene\r\nPeriod, a still larger part of the island is of Pliocene date. That the\r\nlatest outbreaks belonged to the Newer Pliocene Period, I infer from\r\nthe close affinity to the present flora of Madeira of the fossil plants\r\npreserved in a leaf-bed in the north-eastern part of the island. These\r\nfossils, associated with some lignite in the ravine of the river San\r\nJorge, can none of them be proved to be of extinct species, but their\r\nantiquity may be inferred from the following considerations:\r\nFirstly—The leaf-bed, discovered by Mr. Hartung and myself in 1853, at\r\nthe height of 1000 feet above the level of the sea, crops out at the\r\nbase of a cliff formed by the erosion of a gorge cut through\r\nalternating layers of basalt and scoriæ, the product of a vast\r\nsuccession of eruptions of unknown date, piled up to a thickness of\r\n1000 feet, and which were all poured out after the plants, of which\r\nabout twenty species have been recognised, flourished in Madeira. These\r\nlavas are inclined at an angle of about 15° to the north, and came down\r\nfrom the great central region of eruption. Their accumulation implies a\r\nlong period of intermittent volcanic action, subsequently to which the\r\nravine of San Jorge was hollowed out. Secondly—Some few of the plants,\r\nthough perhaps all of living species, are supposed to be of genera not\r\nnow existing in the island. They have been described by Sir Charles\r\nBunbury and Professor Heer, and the former first pointed out that many\r\nof the leaves are of the laurel type, and analogous to those now\r\nflourishing in the modern forests of Madeira. He also recognised among\r\nthem the leaves of _Woodwardia radicans_, _and Davallia Canariensis,_\r\nferns now abundant in Madeira. Thirdly—the great age of this leaf-bed\r\nof San Jorge, which was perhaps originally formed in the crater of some\r\nancient volcanic cone afterwards buried under lava, is proved by its\r\nbelonging to a part of the eastern extremity of Madeira, which, after\r\nthe close of the igneous eruptions, became covered in the adjoining\r\ndistrict of Caniçal with blown sand in which a vast number of\r\nland-shells were buried. These fossil shells belonged to no less than\r\n36 species, among which are many now extremely rare in the island, and\r\nothers, about five per cent, extinct or unknown in any part of the\r\nworld. Several of these of the genus _Helix_ are conspicuous from the\r\npeculiarity of their forms, others from their large dimensions. The\r\ngeographical configuration of the country shows that this shell-bed is\r\nconsiderably more modern than the leaf-bed; it must therefore be\r\nreferred to the Newer Pliocene, according to the definition of this\r\nperiod given in a former chapter (p. 143).\r\n\r\nOlder Pliocene Period.—_Italy._—In Tuscany, as at Radicofani, Viterbo,\r\nand Aquapendente, and in the Campagna di Roma, submarine volcanic tuffs\r\nare interstratified with the Older Pliocene strata of the Sub-apennine\r\nhills in such a manner as to leave no doubt that they were the products\r\nof eruptions which occurred when the shelly marls and sands of the\r\nSub-appenine hills were in the course of deposition. This opinion I\r\nexpressed[5] after my visit to Italy in 1828 and it has recently (1850)\r\nbeen confirmed by the argument adduced by Sir R. Murchison in favour of\r\nthe submarine origin of the tertiary volcanic rocks of Italy.[6] These\r\nrocks are well-known to rest conformably on the Sub-apennine marls,\r\neven as far south as Monte Mario, in the suburbs of Rome. On the exact\r\nage of the deposits of Monte Mario new light has recently been thrown\r\nby a careful study of their marine fossil shells, undertaken by MM.\r\nRayneval, Van den Hecke, and Ponzi. They have compared no less than 160\r\nspecies with the shells of the Coralline Crag of Suffolk, so well\r\ndescribed by Mr. Searles Wood; and the specific agreement between the\r\nBritish and Italian fossils is so great, if we make due allowance for\r\ngeographical distance and the difference of latitude, that we can have\r\nlittle hesitation in referring both to the same period, or to the Older\r\nPliocene of this work. It is highly probable that, between the oldest\r\ntrachytes of Tuscany and the newest rocks in the neighbourhood of\r\nNaples, a series of volcanic products might be detected of every age\r\nfrom the Older Pliocene to the historical epoch.\r\n\r\n_Pliocene Volcanoes of the Eifel._—Some of the most perfect cones and\r\ncraters in Europe, not even excepting those of the district round\r\nVesuvius, may be seen on the left or west bank of the Rhine, near Bonn\r\nand Andernach. They exhibit characters distinct from any which I have\r\nobserved elsewhere, owing to the large part which the escape of aqueous\r\nvapour has played in the eruptions and the small quantities of lava\r\nemitted. The fundamental rocks of the district are grey and red\r\nsandstones and shales, with some associated limestones, replete with\r\nfossils of the Devonian or Old Red Sandstone group. The volcanoes broke\r\nout in the midst of these inclined strata, and when the present systems\r\nof hills and valleys had already been formed. The eruptions occurred\r\nsometimes at the bottom of deep valleys, sometimes on the summit of\r\nhills, and frequently on intervening platforms. In travelling through\r\nthis district we often come upon them most unexpectedly, and may find\r\nourselves on the very edge of a crater before we had been led to\r\nsuspect that we were approaching the site of any igneous outburst.\r\nThus, for example, on arriving at the village of Gemund, immediately\r\nsouth of Daun, we leave the stream, which flows at the bottom of a deep\r\nvalley in which strata of sandstone and shale crop out. We then climb a\r\nsteep hill, on the surface of which we see the edges of the same strata\r\ndipping inward towards the mountain. When we have ascended to a\r\nconsiderable height, we see fragments of scoriæ sparingly scattered\r\nover the surface; until at length, on reaching the summit, we find\r\nourselves suddenly on the edge of a _tarn,_ or deep circular lake-basin\r\ncalled the Gemunder Maar. In it we recognise the ordinary form of a\r\ncrater, for which we have been prepared by the occurrence of scoriæ\r\nscattered over the surface of the soil. But on examining the walls of\r\nthe crater we find precipices of sandstone and shale which exhibit no\r\nsigns of the action of heat; and we look in vain for those beds of lava\r\nand scoriæ, dipping outward on every side, which we have been\r\naccustomed to consider as characteristic of volcanic vents. As we\r\nproceed, however, to the opposite side of the lake, we find a\r\nconsiderable quantity of scoriæ and some lava, and see the whole\r\nsurface of the soil sparkling with volcanic sand, and strewed with\r\nejected fragments of half-fused shale, which preserves its laminated\r\ntexture in the interior, while it has a vitrified or scoriform coating.\r\n\r\nOther crater lakes of circular or oval form, and hollowed out of\r\nsimilar ancient strata, occur in the Upper Eifel, where copious\r\naëriform discharges have taken place, throwing out vast heaps of\r\npulverized shale into the air. I know of no other extinct volcanoes\r\nwhere gaseous explosions of such magnitude have been attended by the\r\nemission of so small a quantity of lava. Yet I looked in vain in the\r\nEifel for any appearances which could lend support to the hypothesis\r\nthat the sudden rushing out of such enormous volumes of gas had ever\r\nlifted up the stratified rocks immediately around the vent so as to\r\nform conical masses, having their strata dipping outward on all sides\r\nfrom a central axis, as is assumed in the theory of elevation craters,\r\nalluded to in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nI have already given (Fig. 590) an example in the Eifel of a small\r\nstream of lava which issued from one of the craters of that district at\r\nBertrich-Baden. It shows that when some of these volcanoes were in\r\naction the valleys had already been eroded to their present depth.\r\n\r\n_Trass._—The tufaceous alluvium called _trass,_ which has covered large\r\nareas in the Eifel, and choked up some valleys now partially\r\nre-excavated, is unstratified. Its base consists almost entirely of\r\npumice, in which are included fragments of basalt and other lavas,\r\npieces of burnt shale, slate, and sandstone, and numerous trunks and\r\nbranches of trees. If, as is probable, this trass was formed during the\r\nperiod of volcanic eruptions, it may have originated in the manner of\r\nthe moya of the Andes.\r\n\r\nWe may easily conceive that a similar mass might now be produced, if a\r\ncopious evolution of gases should occur in one of the lake-basins. If a\r\nbreach should be made in the side of the cone, the flood would sweep\r\naway great heaps of ejected fragments of shale and sandstone, which\r\nwould be borne down into the adjoining valleys. Forests might be torn\r\nup by such a flood, and thus the occurrence of the numerous trunks of\r\ntrees dispersed irregularly through the trass can be explained. The\r\nmanner in which this trass conforms to the shape of the present valleys\r\nimplies its comparatively modern origin, probably not dating farther\r\nback than the Pliocene Period.\r\n\r\n [1] Caldcleugh, Phil.

A similar marine and volcanic formation constitutes the\r\nfundamental portion of the neighbouring island of Porto Santo, forty\r\nmiles distant from Madeira, and is there elevated to an equal height,\r\nand covered, as in Madeira, with lavas of supra-marine origin.\r\n\r\nThe largest number of fossils have been collected from the tuffs and\r\nconglomerates and some beds of limestone in the island of Baixo, off\r\nthe southern extremity of Porto Santo. They amount in this single\r\nlocality to more than sixty in number, of which about fifty are\r\nmollusca, but many of these are only casts. Some of the shells probably\r\nlived on the spot during the intervals between eruptions, and some may\r\nhave been cast up into the water or air together with muddy ejections,\r\nand, falling down again, have been deposited on the bottom of the sea.\r\nThe hollows in some of the fragments of vesicular lava of which the\r\nbreccias and conglomerates are composed are partially filled with\r\ncalc-sinter, being thus half converted into amygdaloids. Among the\r\nfossil shells common to Madeira and Porto Santo, large cones, strombs,\r\nand cowries are conspicuous among the univalves, and _Cardium,\r\nSpondylus,_ and _Lithodomus_ among the lamellibranchiate bivalves, and\r\namong the _Echinoderms_ the large Clypeaster called _C. altus,_ an\r\nextinct European Miocene fossil.\r\n\r\nThe largest list of fossils has been published by Mr. Karl Meyer, in\r\nHartung’s “Madeira;” but in the collection made by myself, and in a\r\nstill larger one formed by Mr. J. Yate Johnson, several remarkable\r\nforms not in Meyer’s list occur, as, for example, _Pholadomya,_ and a\r\nlarge _ Terebra._ Mr. Johnson also found a fine specimen of _Nautilus\r\n(Atruria) ziczac_ (Fig. 211), a well-known Falunian fossil of Europe;\r\nand in the same volcanic tuff of Baixo, the Echinoderm _Brissus\r\nScillæ,_ a living Mediterranean species, found fossil in the Miocene\r\nstrata of Malta. Mr. Meyer identifies one-third of the Madeira shells\r\nwith known European Miocene (or Falunian) forms. The huge Strombus of\r\nSan Vicente and Porto Santo, _S. Italicus,_ is an extinct shell of the\r\nSub-apennine or Older Pliocene formations. The mollusca already\r\nobtained from various localities of Madeira and Porto Santo are not\r\nless than one hundred in number, and, according to the late Dr. S. P.\r\nWoodward, rather more than a third are of species still living, but\r\nmany of these are not now inhabitants of the neighbouring sea.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked (p. 212), that in the Older Pliocene and Upper\r\nMiocene deposits of Europe many forms occur of a more southern aspect\r\nthan those now inhabiting the nearest sea. In like manner the fossil\r\ncorals, or Zoantharia, six in number, which I obtained from Madeira, of\r\nthe genera _Astræa, Sarcinula, Hydnophora,_ were pronounced by Mr.\r\nLonsdale to be forms foreign to the adjacent coasts, and agreeing with\r\nthe fauna of a sea warmer than that now separating Madeira from the\r\nnearest part of the African coast. We learn, indeed, from the\r\nobservations made in 1859, by the Reverend R. T. Lowe, that more than\r\none-half, or fifty-three in ninety, of the marine mollusks collected by\r\nhim from the sandy beach of Mogador are common British species,\r\nalthough Mogador is 18½ degrees south of the nearest shores of England.\r\nThe living shells of Madeira and Porto Santo are in like manner those\r\nof a temperate climate, although in great part differing specifically\r\nfrom those of Mogador.[1]\r\n\r\n_Grand Canary._—In the Canaries, especially in the Grand Canary, the\r\nsame marine Upper Miocene formation is found. Stratified tuffs, with\r\nintercalated conglomerates and lavas, are there seen in nearly\r\nhorizontal layers in sea-cliffs about 300 feet high, near Las Palmas.\r\nMr. Hartung and I were unable to find marine shells in these tuffs at a\r\ngreater elevation than 400 feet above the sea; but as the deposit to\r\nwhich they belong reaches to the height of 1100 feet or more in the\r\ninterior, we conceive that an upheaval of at least that amount has\r\ntaken place. The _Clypeaster altus, Spondylus gæderopus, Pectunculus\r\npilosus, Cardita calyculata,_ and several other shells, serve to\r\nidentify this formation with that of the Madeiras, and _Ancillaria\r\nglandiformis,_ which is not rare, and some other fossils, remind us of\r\nthe faluns of Touraine.\r\n\r\nThe sixty-two Miocene species which I collected in the Grand Canary\r\nwere referred by the late Dr. S. P. Woodward to forty-seven genera, ten\r\nof which are no longer represented in the neighbouring sea, namely\r\n_Corbis,_ an African form, Hinnites, now living in Oregon, _Thecidium_\r\n(_T. Mediterranean,_ identical with the Miocene fossil of St. Juvat, in\r\nBrittany), _Calyptræa, Hipponyx, Nerita, Erato, Oliva, Ancillaria,_ and\r\n_ Fasciolaria._\r\n\r\nThese tuffs of the southern shores of the Grand Canary, containing the\r\nUpper Miocene shells, appear to be about the same age as the most\r\nancient volcanic rocks of the island, composed of slaty diabase,\r\nphonolite, and trachyte. Over the marine lavas and tuffs trachytic and\r\nbasaltic products of subaërial volcanic origin, between 4000 and 5000\r\nfeet in thickness, have been piled, the central parts of the Grand\r\nCanary reaching the height of about 6000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. A large portion of this mass is of Pliocene date, and some of the\r\nlatest lavas have been poured out since the time when the valleys were\r\nalready excavated to within a few feet of their present depth.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the rocks of the Grand Canary, an island of a nearly\r\ncircular shape, and 6½ geographical miles diameter, exhibit proofs of a\r\nlong series of eruptions beginning like those of Madeira, Porto Santo,\r\nand the Azores, in the Upper Miocene period, and continued to the\r\nPost-Pliocene. The building up of the Grand Canary by subaërial\r\neruptions, several thousand feet thick, went on simultaneously with the\r\ngradual upheaval of the earliest products of submarine eruptions, in\r\nthe same manner as the Pliocene marine strata of the oldest parts of\r\nVesuvius and Etna have been upraised during eruptions of Post-tertiary\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nIn proof that movements of elevation have actually continued down to\r\nPost-tertiary times, I may remark that I found raised beaches\r\ncontaining shells of the Recent Period in the Grand Canary, Teneriffe,\r\nand Porto Santo. The most remarkable raised beach which I observed in\r\nthe Grand Canary, in the study of which I was assisted by Don Pedro\r\nMaffiotte, is situated in the north-eastern part of the island at San\r\nCatalina, about a quarter of a mile north of Las Palmas. It intervenes\r\nbetween the base of the high cliff formed of the tuffs with Miocene\r\nshells and the sea-shore. From this beach, at an elevation of\r\ntwenty-five feet above high-water mark, and at a distance of about 150\r\nfeet from the present shore, I obtained more than fifty species of\r\nliving marine shells. Many of them, according to Dr. S. P. Woodward,\r\nare no longer inhabitants of the contiguous sea, as, for example,\r\n_Strombus bubonius,_ which is still living on the West Coast of Africa,\r\nand _Cerithium procerum,_ found at Mozambique; others are Mediterranean\r\nspecies, as _Pecten Jacobæus_ and _P. polymorphus._ Some of these\r\ntestacea, such as _Cardita squamosa,_ are inhabitants of deep water,\r\nand the deposit on the whole seems to indicate a depth of water\r\nexceeding a hundred feet.\r\n\r\n_Azores._—In the island of St. Mary’s, one of the Azores, marine fossil\r\nshells have long been known. They are found on the north-east coast on\r\na small projecting promontory called Ponta do Papagaio (or\r\nPoint-Parrot), chiefly in a limestone about twenty feet thick, which\r\nrests upon, and is again covered by, basaltic lavas, scoriæ, and\r\nconglomerates. The pebbles in the conglomerate are cemented together\r\nwith carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartung, in his account of the Azores, published in 1860, describes\r\ntwenty-three shells from St. Mary’s,[2] of which eight perhaps are\r\nidentical with living species, and twelve are with more or less\r\ncertainty referred to European Tertiary forms, chiefly Upper Miocene.\r\nOne of the most characteristic and abundant of the new species,\r\n_Cardium Hartungi,_ not known as fossil in Europe, is very common in\r\nPorto Santo and Baixo, and serves to connect the Miocene fauna of the\r\nAzores and the Madeiras. In some of the Azores, as well as in the\r\nCanary islands, the volcanic fires are not yet extinct, as the recorded\r\neruptions of Lanzerote, Teneriffe, Palma, St. Michael’s, and others,\r\nattest.\r\n\r\nLower Miocene Volcanic Rocks.—_Isle of Mull and Antrim._—I may refer\r\nthe reader to the account already given (p. 247) of leaf-beds at\r\nArdtun, in the Isle of Mull in the Hebrides, which bear a relation to\r\nthe associated volcanic rocks of Lower Miocene date analogous to that\r\nwhich the Madeira leaf-bed, above described (p. 532), bears to the\r\nPliocene lavas of that island. Mr. Geikie has shown that the volcanic\r\nrocks in Mull are above 3000 feet in thickness. There seems little\r\ndoubt that the well-known columnar basalt of Staffa, as well as that of\r\nAntrim in Ireland, are of the same age, and not of higher antiquity, as\r\nonce suspected.\r\n\r\n_The Eifel._—A large portion of the volcanic rocks of the Lower Rhine\r\nand the Eifel are coeval with the Lower Miocene deposits to which most\r\nof the “Brown-Coal” of Germany belongs. The Tertiary strata of that age\r\nare seen on both sides of the Rhine, in the neighbourhood of Bonn,\r\nresting unconformably on highly inclined and vertical strata of\r\nSilurian and Devonian rocks. The Brown-Coal formation of that region\r\nconsists of beds of loose sand, sandstone, and conglomerate, clay with\r\nnodules of clay-iron-stone, and occasionally silex. Layers of light\r\nbrown and sometimes black lignite are interstratified with the clays\r\nand sands, and often irregularly diffused through them. They contain\r\nnumerous impressions of leaves and stems of trees, and are extensively\r\nworked for fuel, whence the name of the formation. In several places\r\nlayers of trachytic tuff are interstratified, and in these tuffs are\r\nleaves of plants identical with those found in the brown-coal, showing\r\nthat, during the period of the accumulation of the latter, some\r\nvolcanic products were ejected. The igneous rocks of the Westerwald,\r\nand of the mountains called the Siebengebirge, consist partly of\r\nbasaltic and partly of trachytic lavas, the latter being in general the\r\nmore ancient of the two. There are many varieties of trachyte, some of\r\nwhich are highly crystalline, resembling a coarse-grained granite, with\r\nlarge separate crystals of feldspar. Trachytic tuff is also very\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nM. Von Dechen, in his work on the Siebengebirge,[3] has given a copious\r\nlist of the animal and vegetable remains of the fresh-water strata\r\nassociated with the brown-coal of that part of Germany. Plants of the\r\ngenera _Flabellaria, Ceanothus,_ and _ Daphnogene,_ including _D.\r\ncinnamomifolia_ (Fig. 155), occur in these beds, with nearly 150 other\r\nplants. The fishes of the brown-coal near Bonn are found in a\r\nbituminous shale, called paper-coal, from being divisible into\r\nextremely thin leaves. The individuals are very numerous; but they\r\nappear to belong to a small number of species, some of which were\r\nreferred by Agassiz to the genera _Leuciscus, Aspius,_ and _Perca._ The\r\nremains of frogs also, of extinct species, have been discovered in the\r\npaper-coal; and a complete series may be seen in the museum at Bonn,\r\nfrom the most imperfect state of the tadpole to that of the full-grown\r\nanimal. With these a salamander, scarcely distinguishable from the\r\nrecent species, has been found, and the remains of many insects.\r\n\r\nUpper and Lower Miocene Volcanic Rocks of Auvergne.—The extinct\r\nvolcanoes of Auvergne and Cantal, in central France, seem to have\r\ncommenced their eruptions in the Lower Miocene period, but to have been\r\nmost active during the Upper Miocene and Pliocene eras. I have already\r\nalluded to the grand succession of events of which there is evidence in\r\nAuvergne since the last retreat of the sea (see p. 527).\r\n\r\nThe earliest monuments of the Tertiary Period in that region are\r\nlacustrine deposits of great thickness, in the lowest conglomerates of\r\nwhich are rounded pebbles of quartz, mica-schist, granite, and other\r\nnon-volcanic rocks, without the slightest intermixture of igneous\r\nproducts. To these conglomerates succeed argillaceous and calcareous\r\nmarls and limestones, containing Lower Miocene shells and bones of\r\nmammalia, the higher beds of which sometimes alternate with volcanic\r\ntuff of contemporaneous origin. After the filling up or drainage of the\r\nancient lakes, huge piles of trachytic and basaltic rocks, with\r\nvolcanic breccias, accumulated to a thickness of several thousand feet,\r\nand were superimposed upon granite, or the contiguous lacustrine\r\nstrata. The greater portion of these igneous rocks appear to have\r\noriginated during the Upper Miocene and Pliocene periods; and extinct\r\nquadrupeds of those eras, belonging to the genera Mastodon, Rhinoceros,\r\nand others, were buried in ashes and beds of alluvial sand and gravel,\r\nwhich owe their preservation to overspreading sheets of lava.\r\n\r\nIn Auvergne, the most ancient and conspicuous of the volcanic masses is\r\nMont Dor, which rests immediately on the granitic rocks standing apart\r\nfrom the fresh-water strata. This great mountain rises suddenly to the\r\nheight of several thousand feet above the surrounding platform, and\r\nretains the shape of a flattened and somewhat irregular cone, the slope\r\nof which is gradually lost in the high plain around. This cone is\r\ncomposed of layers of scoriæ, pumice-stones, and their fine detritus,\r\nwith interposed beds of trachyte and basalt, which descend often in\r\nuninterrupted sheets until they reach and spread themselves round the\r\nbase of the mountain.[4] Conglomerates, also, composed of angular and\r\nrounded fragments of igneous rocks, are observed to alternate with the\r\nabove; and the various masses are seen to dip off from the central\r\naxis, and to lie parallel to the sloping flanks of the mountain. The\r\nsummit of Mont Dor terminates in seven or eight rocky peaks, where no\r\nregular crater can now be traced, but where we may easily imagine one\r\nto have existed, which may have been shattered by earthquakes, and have\r\nsuffered degradation by aqueous agents. Originally, perhaps, like the\r\nhighest crater of Etna, it may have formed an insignificant feature in\r\nthe great pile, and, like it, may frequently have been destroyed and\r\nrenovated.\r\n\r\nRespecting the age of the great mass of Mont Dor, we cannot come at\r\npresent to any positive decision, because no organic remains have yet\r\nbeen found in the tuffs, except impressions of the leaves of trees of\r\nspecies not yet determined. It has already been stated (p. 234) that\r\nthe earliest eruptions must have been posterior in origin to those\r\ngrits and conglomerates of the fresh-water formation of the Limagne\r\nwhich contain no pebbles of volcanic rocks. But there is evidence at a\r\nfew points, as in the hill of Gergovia, presently to be mentioned, that\r\nsome eruptions took place before the great lakes were drained, while\r\nothers occurred after the desiccation of those lakes, and when deep\r\nvalleys had already been excavated through fresh-water strata.\r\n\r\nThe valley in which the cone of Tartaret, above-mentioned (p. 527), is\r\nsituated affords an impressive monument of the very different dates at\r\nwhich the igneous eruptions of Auvergne have happened; for while the\r\ncone itself is of Post-Pliocene date, the valley is bounded by lofty\r\nprecipices composed of sheets of ancient columnar trachyte and basalt,\r\nwhich once flowed from the summit of Mont Dor in some part of the\r\nMiocene period. These Miocene lavas had accumulated to a thickness of\r\nnearly 1000 feet before the ravine was cut down to the level of the\r\nriver Couze, a river which was at length dammed up by the modern cone\r\nand the upper part of its course transformed into a lake.\r\n\r\n_Gergovia._—It has been supposed by some observers that there is an\r\nalternation of a contemporaneous sheet of lava with fresh-water strata\r\nin the hill of Gergovia, near Clermont. But this idea has arisen from\r\nthe intrusion of the dike represented in Fig. 604, which has altered\r\nthe green and white marls both above and below. Nevertheless, there is\r\na real alternation of volcanic tuff with strata containing Lower\r\nMiocene fresh-water shells, among others a Melania allied to _M.\r\ninquinata_ (Fig. 217), with a Melanopsis and a Unio; there can,\r\ntherefore, be no doubt that in Auvergne some volcanic explosions took\r\nplace before the drainage of the lakes, and at a time when the Lower\r\nMiocene species of animals and plants still flourished.\r\n\r\nFig. 604: Hill of Gergovia.\r\n\r\nEocene Volcanic Rocks.—_Monte Bolca._—The fissile limestone of Monte\r\nBolca, near Verona, has for many centuries been celebrated in Italy for\r\nthe number of perfect Ichthyolites which it contains. Agassiz has\r\ndescribed no less than 133 species of fossil fish from this single\r\ndeposit, and the multitude of individuals by which many of the species\r\nare represented is attested by the variety of specimens treasured up in\r\nthe principal museums of Europe. They have been all obtained from\r\nquarries worked exclusively by lovers of natural history, for the sake\r\nof the fossils. Had the lithographic stone of Solenhofen, now regarded\r\nas so rich in fossils, been in like manner quarried solely for\r\nscientific objects, it would have remained almost a sealed book to\r\npalæontologists, so sparsely are the organic remains scattered through\r\nit. When I visited Monte Bolca, in company with Sir Roderick Murchison,\r\nin 1828, we ascertained that the fish-bearing beds were of Eocene date,\r\ncontaining well-known species of Nummulites, and that a long series of\r\nsubmarine volcanic eruptions, evidently contemporaneous, had produced\r\nbeds of tuff, which are cut through by dikes of basalt. There is\r\nevidence here of a long series of submarine volcanic eruptions of\r\nEocene date, and during some of them, as Sir R. Murchison has\r\nsuggested, shoals of fish were probably destroyed by the evolution of\r\nheat, noxious gases, and tufaceous mud, just as happened when Graham’s\r\nIsland was thrown up between Sicily and Africa in 1831, at which time\r\nthe waters of the Mediterranean were seen to be charged with red mud,\r\nand covered with dead fish over a wide area.[5]\r\n\r\nAssociated with the marls and limestones of Monte Bolca are beds\r\ncontaining lignite and shale with numerous plants, which have been\r\ndescribed by Unger and Massalongo, and referred by them to the Eocene\r\nperiod. I have already cited (p. 263) Professor Heer’s remark, that\r\nseveral of the species are common to Monte Bolca and the white clay of\r\nAlum Bay, a Middle Eocene deposit; and the same botanist dwells on the\r\ntropical character of the flora of Monte Bolca and its distinctness\r\nfrom the sub-tropical flora of the Lower Miocene of Switzerland and\r\nItaly, in which last there is a far more considerable mixture of forms\r\nof a temperate climate, such as the willow, poplar, birch, elm, and\r\nothers. That scarcely any one of the Monte Bolca fish should have been\r\nfound in any other locality in Europe, is a striking illustration of\r\nthe extreme imperfection of the palæontological record. We are in the\r\nhabit of imagining that our insight into the geology of the Eocene\r\nperiod is more than usually perfect, and we are certainly acquainted\r\nwith an almost unbroken succession of assemblages of shells passing one\r\ninto the other from the era of the Thanet sands to that of the\r\nBembridge beds or Paris gypsum. The general dearth, therefore, of fish\r\nin the different members of the Eocene series, Upper, Middle, and\r\nLower, might induce a hasty reasoner to conclude that there was a\r\npoverty of ichthyic forms during this period; but when a local\r\naccident, like the volcanic eruptions of Monte Bolca, occurs, proofs\r\nare suddenly revealed to us of the richness and variety of this great\r\nclass of vertebrata in the Eocene sea. The number of genera of Monte\r\nBolca fish is, according to Agassiz, no less than seventy-five, twenty\r\nof them peculiar to that locality, and only eight common to the\r\nantecedent Cretaceous period. No less than forty-seven out of the\r\nseventy-five genera make their appearance for the first time in the\r\nMonte Bolca rocks, none of them having been met with as yet in the\r\nantecedent formations. They form a great contrast to the fish of the\r\nsecondary strata, as, with the exception of the Placoids, they are all\r\nTeleosteans, only one genus, _Pycnodus,_ belonging to the order of\r\nGanoids, which form, as before stated, the vast majority of the\r\nichthyolites entombed in the secondary are Mesozoic rocks.\r\n\r\nCretaceous Period.—M. Virlet, in his account of the geology of the\r\nMorea, p. 205, has clearly shown that certain traps in Greece are of\r\nCretaceous date; as those, for example, which alternate conformably\r\nwith cretaceous limestone and greensand between Kastri and Damala, in\r\nthe Morea. They consist in great part of diallage rocks and serpentine,\r\nand of an amygdaloid with calcareous kernels, and a base of serpentine.\r\nIn certain parts of the Morea, the age of these volcanic rocks is\r\nestablished by the following proofs: first, the lithographic limestones\r\nof the Cretaceous era are cut through by trap, and then a conglomerate\r\noccurs, at Nauplia and other places, containing in its calcareous\r\ncement many well-known fossils of the chalk and greensand, together\r\nwith pebbles formed of rolled pieces of the same serpentinous trap,\r\nwhich appear in the dikes above alluded to.\r\n\r\nPeriod of Oolite and Lias.—Although the green and serpentinous\r\ntrap-rocks of the Morea belong chiefly to the Cretaceous era, as before\r\nmentioned, yet it seems that some eruptions of similar rocks began\r\nduring the Oolitic period;[6] and it is probable that a large part of\r\nthe trappean masses, called ophiolites in the Apennines, and associated\r\nwith the limestone of that chain, are of corresponding age.\r\n\r\nTrap of the New Red Sandstone Period.—In the southern part of\r\nDevonshire, trappean rocks are associated with New Red Sandstone, and,\r\naccording to Sir H. De la Beche, have not been intruded subsequently\r\ninto the sandstone, but were produced by contemporaneous volcanic\r\naction. Some beds of grit, mingled with ordinary red marl, resemble\r\nsands ejected from a crater; and in the stratified conglomerates\r\noccurring near Tiverton are many angular fragments of trap porphyry,\r\nsome of them one or two tons in weight, intermingled with pebbles of\r\nother rocks. These angular fragments were probably thrown out from\r\nvolcanic vents, and fell upon sedimentary matter then in the course of\r\ndeposition.[7]\r\n\r\nTrap of the Permian Period.—The recent investigations of Mr. Archibald\r\nGeikie in Ayrshire have shown that some of the volcanic rocks in that\r\ncounty are of Permian age, and it appears highly probable that the\r\nuppermost portion of Arthur’s Seat in the suburbs of Edinburgh marks\r\nthe site of an eruption of the same era.\r\n\r\nTrap of the Carboniferous Period.—Two classes of contemporaneous\r\ntrap-rocks occur in the coal-field of the Forth, in Scotland. The\r\nnewest of these, connected with the higher series of coal-measures, is\r\nwell exhibited along the shores of the Forth, in Fifeshire, where they\r\nconsist of basalt with olivine, amygdaloid, greenstone, wacke, and\r\ntuff. They appear to have been erupted while the sedimentary strata\r\nwere in a horizontal position, and to have suffered the same\r\ndislocations which those strata have subsequently undergone. In the\r\nvolcanic tuffs of this age are found not only fragments of limestone,\r\nshale, flinty slate, and sandstone, but also pieces of coal. The other\r\nor older class of carboniferous traps are traced along the south margin\r\nof Stratheden, and constitute a ridge parallel with the Ochils, and\r\nextending from Stirling to near St. Andrews. They consist almost\r\nexclusively of greenstone, becoming, in a few instances, earthy and\r\namygdaloidal. They are regularly interstratified with the sandstone,\r\nshale, and iron-stone of the lower coal-measures, and, on the East\r\nLomond, with Mountain Limestone. I examined these trap-rocks in 1838,\r\nin the cliffs south of St. Andrews, where they consist in great part of\r\nstratified tuffs, which are curved, vertical, and contorted, like the\r\nassociated coal-measures. In the tuff I found fragments of\r\ncarboniferous shale and limestone, and intersecting veins of\r\ngreenstone.\r\n\r\n_Fife—Flisk Dike._—A trap dike was pointed out to me by Dr. Fleming, in\r\nthe parish of Flisk, in the northern part of the county of Fife, which\r\ncuts through the grey sandstone and shale, forming the lowest part of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone, but which may probably be of carboniferous date.\r\nIt may be traced for many miles, passing through the amygdaloidal and\r\nother traps of the hill called Norman’s Law in that parish. In its\r\ncourse it affords a good exemplification of the passage from the\r\ntrappean into the Plutonic, or highly crystalline texture. Professor\r\nGustavus Rose, to whom I submitted specimens of this dike, found it to\r\nbe dolerite, and composed of greenish black augite and Labrador\r\nfeldspar, the latter being the most abundant ingredient. A small\r\nquantity of magnetic iron, perhaps titaniferous, is also present. The\r\nresult of this analysis is interesting, because both the ancient and\r\nmodern lavas of Etna consist in like manner of augite, Labradorite, and\r\ntitaniferous iron.\r\n\r\n_Erect Trees buried in Volcanic Ash at Arran._—An interesting discovery\r\nwas made in 1867 by Mr. E. A. Wünsch in the carboniferous strata of the\r\nnorth-eastern part of the island of Arran. In the sea-cliff about five\r\nmiles north of Corrie, near the village of Laggan, strata of volcanic\r\nash occur, forming a solid rock cemented by carbonate of lime and\r\nenveloping trunks of trees, determined by Mr. Binney to belong to the\r\ngenera Sigillaria and Lepidodendron. Some of these trees are at right\r\nangles to the planes of stratification, while others are prostrate and\r\naccompanied by leaves and fruits of the same genera. I visited the spot\r\nin company with Mr. Wünsch in 1870, and saw that the trees with their\r\nroots, of which about fourteen had been observed, occur at two distinct\r\nlevels in volcanic tuffs parallel to each other, and inclined at an\r\nangle of about 40°, having between them beds of shale and coaly matter\r\nseven feet thick. It is evident that the trees were overwhelmed by a\r\nshower of ashes from some neighbouring volcanic vent, as Pompeii was\r\nburied by matter ejected from Vesuvius. The trunks, several of them\r\nfrom three to five feet in circumference, remained with their\r\nStigmarian roots spreading through the stratum below, which had served\r\nas a soil. The trees must have continued for years in an upright\r\nposition after they were killed by the shower of burning ashes, giving\r\ntime for a partial decay of the interior, so as to afford hollow\r\ncylinders into which the spores of plants were wafted. These spores\r\ngerminated and grew, until finally their stems were petrified by\r\ncarbonate of lime like some of the remaining portions of the wood of\r\nthe containing Sigillaria. Mr. Carruthers has discovered that sometimes\r\nthe plants which had thus grown and become fossil in the inside of a\r\nsingle trunk belonged to several distinct genera. The fact that the\r\ntree-bearing deposits now dip at an angle of 40° is the more striking,\r\nas they must clearly have remained horizontal and undisturbed during a\r\nlong period of intermittent and contemporaneous volcanic action.\r\n\r\nIn some of the associated carboniferous shales, ferns and calamites\r\noccur, and all the phenomena of the successive buried forests remind us\r\nof the sections in pp. 410 and 411 of the Nova Scotia coal-measures,\r\nwith this difference only, that in the case of the South Joggins the\r\nfossilisation of the trees was effected without the eruption of\r\nvolcanic matter.\r\n\r\nTrap of the Old Red Sandstone Period.—By referring to the section\r\nexplanatory of the structure of Forfarshire, already given (p. 74), the\r\nreader will perceive that beds of conglomerate, No. 3, occur in the\r\nmiddle of the Old Red Sandstone system, 1, 2, 3, 4. The pebbles in\r\nthese conglomerates are sometimes composed of granitic and quartzose\r\nrocks, sometimes exclusively of different varieties of trap, which\r\nlast, although purposely omitted in the section referred to, is often\r\nfound either intruding itself in amorphous masses and dikes into the\r\nold fossiliferous tilestones, No. 4, or alternating with them in\r\nconformable beds. All the different divisions of the red sandstone, 1,\r\n2, 3, 4, are occasionally intersected by dikes, but they are very rare\r\nin Nos. 1 and 2, the upper members of the group consisting of red shale\r\nand red sandstone. These phenomena, which occur at the foot of the\r\nGrampians, are repeated in the Sidlaw Hills; and it appears that in\r\nthis part of Scotland volcanic eruptions were most frequent in the\r\nearlier part of the Old Red Sandstone period. The trap-rocks alluded to\r\nconsist chiefly of feldspathic porphyry and amygdaloid, the kernels of\r\nthe latter being sometimes calcareous, often chalcedonic, and forming\r\nbeautiful agates. We meet also with claystone, greenstone, compact\r\nfeldspar, and tuff. Some of these rocks look as if they had flowed as\r\nlavas over the bottom of the sea, and enveloped quartz pebbles which\r\nwere lying there, so as to form conglomerates with a base of\r\ngreenstone, as is seen in Lumley Den, in the Sidlaw Hills. On either\r\nside of the axis of this chain of hills (see Fig. 55), the beds of\r\nmassive trap, and the tuffs composed of volcanic sand and ashes, dip\r\nregularly to the south-east or north-west, conformably with the shales\r\nand sandstones.\r\n\r\nBut the geological structure of the Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh,\r\nshows that igneous rocks were there formed during the newer part of the\r\nDevonian or “Old Red” period. These hills are 1900 feet high above the\r\nsea, and consist of conglomerates and sandstones of Upper Devonian age,\r\nresting on the inclined edges of grits and slates of Lower Devonian and\r\nUpper Silurian date. The contemporaneous volcanic rocks intercalated in\r\nthis Upper Old Red consist of feldspathic lavas, or feldstones, with\r\nassociated tuffs or ashy beds. The lavas were some of them originally\r\ncompact, others vesicular, and these last have been converted into\r\namygdaloids. They consist chiefly of feldstone or compact feldspar. The\r\nPentland Hills, say Messrs. Maclaren and Geikie, afford evidence that\r\nat the time of the Upper Old Red Sandstone, the district to the\r\nsouth-west of Edinburgh was for a long while the seat of a powerful\r\nvolcano, which sent out massive streams of lava and showers of ash, and\r\ncontinued active until well-nigh the dawn of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod.[8]\r\n\r\nSilurian Volcanic Rocks.—It appears from the investigations of Sir R.\r\nMurchison in Shropshire, that when the Lower Silurian strata of that\r\ncountry were accumulating, there were frequent volcanic eruptions\r\nbeneath the sea; and the ashes and scoriæ then ejected gave rise to a\r\npeculiar kind of tufaceous sandstone or grit, dissimilar to the other\r\nrocks of the Silurian series, and only observable in places where\r\nsyenitic and other trap-rocks protrude. These tuffs occur on the flanks\r\nof the Wrekin and Caer Caradoc, and contain Silurian fossils, such as\r\ncasts of encrinites, trilobites, and mollusca. Although fossiliferous,\r\nthe stone resembles a sandy claystone of the trap family.[9]\r\n\r\nThin layers of trap, only a few inches thick, alternate in some parts\r\nof Shropshire and Montgomeryshire with sedimentary strata of the Lower\r\nSilurian system. This trap consists of slaty porphyry and granular\r\nfeldspar rock, the beds being traversed by joints like those in the\r\nassociated sandstone, limestone, and shale, and having the same strike\r\nand dip.[10]\r\n\r\nIn Radnorshire there is an example of twelve bands of stratified trap,\r\nalternating with Silurian schists and flagstones, in a thickness of 350\r\nfeet. The bedded traps consist of feldspar porphyry, and other\r\nvarieties; and the interposed Llandeilo flags are of sandstone and\r\nshale, with trilobites and graptolites.[11]\r\n\r\nThe Snowdonian hills in Carnarvonshire consist in great part of\r\nvolcanic tuffs, the oldest of which are interstratified with the Bala\r\nand Llandeilo beds. There are some contemporaneous feldspathic lavas of\r\nthis era, which, says Professor Ramsay, alter the slates on which they\r\nrepose, having doubtless been poured out over them, in a melted state,\r\nwhereas the slates which overlie them having been subsequently\r\ndeposited after the lava had cooled and consolidated, have entirely\r\nescaped alteration. But there are greenstones associated with the same\r\nformation, which, although they are often conformable to the slates,\r\nare in reality intrusive rocks. They alter the stratified deposits both\r\nabove and below them, and when traced to great distances are sometimes\r\nseen to cut through the slates, and to send off branches. Nevertheless,\r\nthese greenstones appear to belong, like the lavas, to the Lower\r\nSilurian period.\r\n\r\nCambrian Volcanic Rocks.—The Lingula beds in North Wales have been\r\ndescribed as 5000 feet in thickness. In the upper portion of these\r\ndeposits volcanic tuffs or ashy materials are interstratified with\r\nordinary muddy sediment, and here and there associated with thick beds\r\nof feldspathic lava. These rocks form the mountains called the Arans\r\nand the Arenigs; numerous greenstones are associated with them, which\r\nare intrusive, although they often run in the lines of bedding for a\r\nspace. “Much of the ash,” says Professor Ramsay, “seems to have been\r\nsubaërial. Islands, like Graham’s Island, may have sometimes raised\r\ntheir craters for various periods above the water, and by the waste of\r\nsuch islands some of the ashy matter became waterworn, whence the ashy\r\nconglomerate. Viscous matter seems also to have been shot into the air\r\nas volcanic bombs, which fell among the dust and broken crystals (that\r\noften form the ashes) before perfect cooling and consolidation had\r\ntaken place.”[12]\r\n\r\nLaurentian Volcanic Rocks.—The Laurentian rocks in Canada, especially\r\nin Ottawa and Argenteuil, are the oldest intrusive masses yet known.\r\nThey form a set of dikes of a fine-grained dark greenstone or dolerite,\r\ncomposed of feldspar and pyroxene, with occasional scales of mica and\r\ngrains of pyrites. Their width varies from a few feet to a hundred\r\nyards, and they have a columnar structure, the columns being truly at\r\nright angles to the plane of the dike. Some of the dikes send off\r\nbranches. These dolerites are cut through by intrusive syenite, and\r\nthis syenite, in its turn, is again cut and penetrated by feldspar\r\nporphyry, the base of which consists of petrosilex, or a mixture of\r\northoclase and quartz. All these trap-rocks appear to be of Laurentian\r\ndate, as the Cambrian and Huronian rocks rest unconformably upon\r\nthem.[13] Whether some of the various conformable crystalline rocks of\r\nthe Laurentian series, such as the coarse-grained granitoid and\r\nporphyritic varieties of gneiss, exhibiting scarcely any signs of\r\nstratification, and some of the serpentines, may not also be of\r\nvolcanic origin, is a point very difficult to determine in a region\r\nwhich has undergone so much metamorphic action.\r\n\r\n [1] Linnean Proceedings; Zoology, 1860.\r\n\r\n [2] Hartung, Die Azoren, 1860; also Insel Gran Canaria, Madeira und\r\n Porto Santo, 1864, Leipsig.\r\n\r\n [3] Geognost.

I have\r\ndescribed, in the first chapter, these Plutonic rocks as the\r\nunstratified division of the crystalline or hypogene formations, and\r\nhave stated that they differ from the volcanic rocks, not only by their\r\nmore crystalline texture, but also by the absence of tuffs and\r\nbreccias, which are the products of eruptions at the earth’s surface,\r\nwhether thrown up into the air or the sea. They differ also by the\r\nabsence of pores or cellular cavities, to which the expansion of the\r\nentangled gases gives rise in ordinary lava, never being scoriaceous or\r\namygdaloidal, and never forming a porphyry with an uncrystalline base,\r\nnor alternating with tuffs.\r\n\r\nFrom these and other peculiarities it has been inferred that the\r\ngranites have been formed at considerable depths in the earth, and have\r\ncooled and crystallised slowly under great pressure, where the\r\ncontained gases could not expand. The volcanic rocks, on the contrary,\r\nalthough they also have risen up from below, have cooled from a melted\r\nstate more rapidly upon or near the surface. From this hypothesis of\r\nthe great depth at which the granites originated, has been derived the\r\nname of “Plutonic rocks.” The beginner will easily conceive that the\r\ninfluence of subterranean heat may extend downward from the crater of\r\nevery active volcano to a great depth below, perhaps several miles or\r\nleagues, and the effects which are produced deep in the bowels of the\r\nearth may, or rather must, be distinct; so that volcanic and Plutonic\r\nrocks, each different in texture, and sometimes even in composition,\r\nmay originate simultaneously, the one at the surface, the other far\r\nbeneath it. The Plutonic formations also agree with the volcanic in\r\nhaving veins or ramifications proceeding from central masses into the\r\nadjoining rocks, and causing alterations in these last, which will be\r\npresently described. They also resemble trap in containing no organic\r\nremains; but they differ in being more uniform in texture, whole\r\nmountain masses of indefinite extent appearing to have originated under\r\nconditions precisely similar.\r\n\r\nThe two principal members of the Plutonic family of rocks are Granite\r\nand Syenite, each of which, with their varieties, bear very much the\r\nsame relation to each other as the trachytes bear to the basalts.\r\nGranite is a compound of feldspar, quartz, and mica, the feldspars\r\nbeing rich in silica, which forms from 60 to 70 per cent of the whole\r\naggregate. In Syenite quartz is rare or wanting, hornblende taking the\r\nplace of mica, and the proportion of silica not exceeding 50 to 60 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nFig. 605: Mass of granite near the Sharp Tor, Cornwall.\r\n\r\nGranite and its Varieties.—Granite often preserves a very uniform\r\ncharacter throughout a wide range of territory, forming hills of a\r\npeculiar rounded form, usually clad with a scanty vegetation. The\r\nsurface of the rock is for the most part in a crumbling state, and the\r\nhills are often surmounted by piles of stones like the remains of a\r\nstratified mass, as in Figure 605, and sometimes like heaps of\r\nboulders, for which they have been mistaken. The exterior of these\r\nstones, originally quadrangular, acquires a rounded form by the action\r\nof air and water, for the edges and angles waste away more rapidly than\r\nthe sides. A similar spherical structure has already been described as\r\ncharacteristic of basalt and other volcanic formations, and it must be\r\nreferred to analogous causes, as yet but imperfectly understood.\r\nAlthough it is the general peculiarity of granite to assume no definite\r\nshapes, it is nevertheless occasionally subdivided by fissures, so as\r\nto assume a cuboidal, and even a columnar, structure. Examples of these\r\nappearances may be seen near the Land’s End, in Cornwall. (See Fig.\r\n606.)\r\n\r\nFeldspar, quartz, and mica are usually considered as the minerals\r\nessential to granite, the feldspar being most abundant in quantity, and\r\nthe proportion of quartz exceeding that of mica. These minerals are\r\nunited in what is termed a confused crystallisation; that is to say,\r\nthere is no regular arrangement of the crystals in granite, as in\r\ngneiss (see Fig. 622), except in the variety termed graphic granite,\r\nwhich occurs mostly in granitic veins. This variety is a compound of\r\nfeldspar and quartz, so arranged as to produce an imperfect laminar\r\nstructure. The crystals of feldspar appear to have been first formed,\r\nleaving between them the space now occupied by the darker-coloured\r\nquartz. This mineral, when a section is made at right angles to the\r\nalternate plates of feldspar and quartz, presents broken lines, which\r\nhave been compared to Hebrew characters. (See Fig. 608.) The variety of\r\ngranite called by the French _Pegmatite,_ which is a mixture of quartz\r\nand common feldspar, usually with some small admixture of white silvery\r\nmica, often passes into graphic granite.\r\n\r\nFig. 606: Granite having a cuboidal and rude columnar structure, Land’s\r\nEnd, Cornwall.\r\n\r\nOrdinary granite, as well as syenite and eurite, usually contains two\r\nkinds of feldspar: First, the common, or orthoclase, in which potash is\r\nthe prevailing alkali, and this generally occurs in large crystals of a\r\nwhite or flesh colour; and secondly, feldspar in smaller crystals, in\r\nwhich soda predominates, usually of a dead white or spotted, and\r\nstriated like albite, but not the same in composition.[1]\r\n\r\nGraphic granite. Fig. 607: Section parallel to the laminæ. Fig. 608:\r\nSection transverse to the laminæ.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, quartz, in a compact or amorphous state, forms a\r\nvitreous mass, serving as the base in which feldspar and mica have\r\ncrystallised; for although these minerals are much more fusible than\r\nsilex, they have often imprinted their shapes upon the quartz. This\r\nfact, apparently so paradoxical, has given rise to much ingenious\r\nspeculation. We should naturally have anticipated that, during the\r\ncooling of the mass, the flinty portion would be the first to\r\nconsolidate; and that the different varieties of feldspar, as well as\r\ngarnets and tourmalines, being more easily liquefied by heat, would be\r\nthe last. Precisely the reverse has taken place in the passage of most\r\ngranite aggregates from a fluid to a solid state, crystals of the more\r\nfusible minerals being found enveloped in hard, transparent, glassy\r\nquartz, which has often taken very faithful casts of each, so as to\r\npreserve even the microscopically minute striations on the surface of\r\nprisms of tourmaline. Various explanations of this phenomenon have been\r\nproposed by MM. de Beaumont, Fournet, and Durocher. They refer to M.\r\nGaudin’s experiments on the fusion of quartz, which show that silex, as\r\nit cools, has the property of remaining in a viscous state, whereas\r\nalumina never does. This “gelatinous flint” is supposed to retain a\r\nconsiderable degree of plasticity long after the granitic mixture has\r\nacquired a low temperature. Occasionally we find the quartz and\r\nfeldspar mutually imprinting their forms on each other, affording\r\nevidence of the simultaneous crystallisation of both.[2]\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments and observations of Gustavus Rose, the\r\nquartz of granite has the specific gravity of 2·6, which characterises\r\nsilica when it is precipitated from a liquid solvent, and not that\r\ninferior density, namely, 2·3, which belongs to it when it cools in the\r\nlaboratory from a state of fusion in what is called the dry way. By\r\nsome it had been rashly inferred that the manner in which the\r\nconsolidation of granite takes place is exceedingly different from the\r\ncooling of lavas, and that the intense heat supposed to be necessary\r\nfor the production of mountain masses of Plutonic rocks might be\r\ndispensed with. But Mr. David Forbes informs me that silica can\r\ncrystallise in the dry way, and he has found in quartz forming a\r\nconstituent part of some trachytes, both from Guadeloupe and Iceland,\r\nglass cavities quite similar to those met with in genuine volcanic\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThese “glass cavities,” which with many other kindred phenomena have\r\nbeen carefully studied by Mr. Sorby, are those in which a liquid, on\r\ncooling, has become first viscous and then solid without crystallising\r\nor undergoing a definite change in its physical structure. Other\r\ncavities which, like those just mentioned, are frequently discernible\r\nunder the microscope in the minerals composing granitic rocks, are\r\nfilled, some of them with gas or vapour, others with liquid, and by the\r\nmovements of the bubbles thus included the distinctness of such\r\ncavities from those filled with a glassy substance can be tested. Mr.\r\nSorby admits that the frequent occurrence of fluid cavities in the\r\nquartz of granite implies that water was almost always present in the\r\nformation of this rock; but the same may be said of almost all lavas,\r\nand it is now more than forty years since Mr. Scrope insisted on the\r\nimportant part which water plays in volcanic eruptions, being so\r\nintimately mixed up with the materials of the lava that he supposed it\r\nto aid in giving mobility to the fluid mass. It is well known that\r\nsteam escapes for months, sometimes for years, from the cavities of\r\nlava when it is cooling and consolidating. As to the result of Mr.\r\nSorby’s experiments and speculations on this difficult subject, they\r\nmay be stated in a few words. He concludes that the physical conditions\r\nunder which the volcanic and granitic rocks originate are so far\r\nsimilar that in both cases they combine igneous fusion, aqueous\r\nsolution, and gaseous sublimation—the proof, he says, of the operation\r\nof water in the formation of granite being quite as strong as of that\r\nof heat.[3]\r\n\r\nWhen rocks are melted at great depths water must be present, for two\r\nreasons—First, because rainwater and seawater are always descending\r\nthrough fissured and porous rocks, and must at length find their way\r\ninto the regions of subterranean heat; and secondly, because in a state\r\nof combination water enters largely into the composition of some of the\r\nmost common minerals, especially those of the aluminous class. But the\r\nexistence of water under great pressure affords no argument against our\r\nattributing an excessively high temperature to the mass with which it\r\nis mixed up. Bunsen, indeed, imagines that in Iceland water attains a\r\nwhite heat at a very moderate depth. To what extent some of the\r\nmetamorphic rocks containing the same minerals as the granites may have\r\nbeen formed by hydrothermal action without the intervention of intense\r\nheat comparable to that brought into play in a volcanic eruption, will\r\nbe considered when we treat of the metamorphic rocks in the\r\nthirty-third chapter.\r\n\r\nFig. 609: Porphyritic granite. Land’s End, Cornwall.\r\n\r\n_Porphyritic Granite._—This name has been sometimes given to that\r\nvariety in which large crystals of common feldspar, sometimes more than\r\nthree inches in length, are scattered through an ordinary base of\r\ngranite. An example of this texture may be seen in the granite of the\r\nLand’s End, in Cornwall (Fig. 609). The two larger prismatic crystals\r\nin this drawing represent feldspar, smaller crystals of which are also\r\nseen, similar in form, scattered through the base. In this base also\r\nappear black specks of mica, the crystals of which have a more or less\r\nperfect hexagonal outline. The remainder of the mass is quartz, the\r\ntranslucency of which is strongly contrasted to the opaqueness of the\r\nwhite feldspar and black mica. But neither the transparency of the\r\nquartz nor the silvery lustre of the mica can be expressed in the\r\nengraving.\r\n\r\nThe uniform mineral character of large masses of granite seems to\r\nindicate that large quantities of the component elements were\r\nthoroughly mixed up together, and then crystallised under precisely\r\nsimilar conditions. There are, however, many accidental, or\r\n“occasional,” minerals, as they are termed, which belong to granite.\r\nAmong these black schorl or tourmaline, actinolite, zircon, garnet, and\r\nfluor spar are not uncommon; but they are too sparingly dispersed to\r\nmodify the general aspect of the rock. They show, nevertheless, that\r\nthe ingredients were not everywhere exactly the same; and a still\r\ngreater difference may be traced in the ever-varying proportions of the\r\nfeldspar, quartz, and mica.\r\n\r\n_Talcose Granite,_ or Protogine of the French, is a mixture of\r\nfeldspar, quartz, and talc. It abounds in the Alps, and in some parts\r\nof Cornwall, producing by its decomposition the kaolin or china clay,\r\nmore than 12,000 tons of which are annually exported from that country\r\nfor the potteries.\r\n\r\n_Schorl-rock, and Schorly Granite._—The former of these is an aggregate\r\nof schorl, or tourmaline, and quartz. When feldspar and mica are also\r\npresent, it may be called schorly granite. This kind of granite is\r\ncomparatively rare.\r\n\r\n_Eurite, Feldstone._—Eurite is a rock in which the ingredients of\r\ngranite are blended into a finely granular mass, mica being usually\r\nabsent, and, when present, in such minute flakes as to be invisible to\r\nthe naked eye. It is sometimes called _Feldstone,_ and when the\r\ncrystals of feldspar are conspicuous it becomes _Feldspar porphyry._\r\nAll these and other varieties of granite pass into certain kinds of\r\ntrap—a circumstance which affords one of many arguments in favour of\r\nwhat is now the prevailing opinion, that the granites are also of\r\nigneous origin. The contrast of the most crystalline form of granite to\r\nthat of the most common and earthy trap is undoubtedly great; but each\r\nmember of the volcanic class is capable of becoming porphyritic, and\r\nthe base of the porphyry may be more and more crystalline, until the\r\nmass passes to the kind of granite most nearly allied in mineral\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n_Syenitic Granite._—The quadruple compound of quartz, feldspar, mica,\r\nand hornblende, may be termed Syenitic Granite, and forms a passage\r\nbetween the granites and the syenites. This rock occurs in Scotland and\r\nin Guernsey.\r\n\r\nSyenite.—We now come to the second division of the Plutonic rocks, or\r\nthose having less than 60 per cent of silica, and which, as before\r\nstated (p. 552), are usually called syenitic. Syenite originally\r\nreceived its name from the celebrated ancient quarries of Syene, in\r\nEgypt. It differs from granite in having hornblende as a substitute for\r\nmica, and being without quartz. Werner at least considered syenite as a\r\nbinary compound of feldspar and hornblende, and regarded quartz as\r\nmerely one of its occasional minerals.\r\n\r\n_Miascite._—Miascite is one of the varieties of syenite most frequently\r\nspoken of; it is composed chiefly of orthoclase and nepheline, with\r\nhornblende and quartz as occasional accessory minerals. It derives its\r\nname from Miask, in the Ural Mountains, where it was first discovered\r\nby Gustavus Rose. _Zircon-syenite_ is another variety closely allied to\r\nMiascite, but containing crystals of Zircon.\r\n\r\nConnection of the Granites and Syenites with the Volcanic Rocks.—The\r\nminerals which constitute alike the Plutonic and volcanic rocks\r\nconsist, almost exclusively, of seven elements, namely, silica,\r\nalumina, magnesia, lime, soda, potash, and iron (see Table p. 449); and\r\nthese may sometimes exist in about the same proportions in a porous\r\nlava, a compact trap, and a crystalline granite. The same lava, for\r\nexample, may be glassy, or scoriaceous, or stony, or porphyritic,\r\naccording to the more or less rapid rate at which it cools.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply examples and authorities to prove the\r\ngradation of the Plutonic into the trap rocks. On the western side of\r\nthe Fiord of Christiania, in Norway, there is a large district of trap,\r\nchiefly greenstone-porphyry and syenitic-greenstone, resting on\r\nfossiliferous strata. To this, on its southern limit, succeeds a region\r\nequally extensive of syenite, the passage from the trappean to the\r\ncrystalline Plutonic rock being so gradual that it is impossible to\r\ndraw a line of demarkation between them.\r\n\r\n“The ordinary granite of Aberdeenshire,” says Dr. MacCulloch, “is the\r\nusual ternary compound of quartz, feldspar, and mica; though sometimes\r\nhornblende is substituted for the mica. But in many places a variety\r\noccurs which is composed simply of feldspar and hornblende; and in\r\nexamining more minutely this duplicate compound, it is observed in some\r\nplaces to assume a fine grain, and at length to become\r\nundistinguishable from the greenstones of the trap family. It also\r\npasses in the same uninterrupted manner into a basalt, and at length\r\ninto a soft claystone, with a schistose tendency on exposure, in no\r\nrespect differing from those of the trap islands of the western coast.”\r\nThe same author mentions, that in Shetland a granite composed of\r\nhornblende, mica, feldspar, and quartz graduates in an equally perfect\r\nmanner into basalt.[4] In Hungary there are varieties of trachyte,\r\nwhich, geologically speaking, are of modern origin, in which crystals,\r\nnot only of mica, but of quartz, are common, together with feldspar and\r\nhornblende. It is easy to conceive how such volcanic masses may, at a\r\ncertain depth from the surface, pass downward into granite.\r\n\r\nGranitic Veins.—I have already hinted at the close analogy in the forms\r\nof certain granitic and trappean veins; and it will be found that\r\nstrata penetrated by Plutonic rocks have suffered changes very similar\r\nto those exhibited near the contact of volcanic dikes. Thus, in Glen\r\nTilt, in Scotland, alternating strata of limestone and argillaceous\r\nschist come in contact with a mass of granite. The contact does not\r\ntake place as might have been looked for if the granite had been formed\r\nthere before the strata were deposited, in which case the section would\r\nhave appeared as in Fig. 610; but the union is as represented in Fig.\r\n611, the undulating outline of the granite intersecting different\r\nstrata, and occasionally intruding itself in torturous veins into the\r\nbeds of clay-slate and limestone, from which it differs so remarkably\r\nin composition. The limestone is sometimes changed in character by the\r\nproximity of the granitic mass or its veins, and acquires a more\r\ncompact texture, like that of hornstone or chert, with a splintery\r\nfracture, and effervescing freely with acids.\r\n\r\nFig. 610 and Fig. 611: Junction of granite and arbillaceous schist in\r\nGlen Tilt. (MacCulloch.) Fig. 610 and Fig. 611: Junction of granite and\r\narbillaceous schist in Glen Tilt. (MacCulloch.)[5]\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the limestone and these and many other instances into\r\na siliceous rock, effervescing slowly with acids, would be difficult of\r\nexplanation, were it not ascertained that such limestones are always\r\nimpure, containing grains of quartz, mica, or feldspar disseminated\r\nthrough them. The elements of these minerals, when the rock has been\r\nsubjected to great heat, may have been fused, and so spread more\r\nuniformly through the whole mass.\r\n\r\nIn the Plutonic, as in the volcanic rocks, there is every gradation\r\nfrom a tortuous vein to the most regular form of a dike, such as\r\nintersect the tuffs and lavas of Vesuvius and Etna. Dikes of granite\r\nmay be seen, among other places, on the southern flank of Mount\r\nBattock, one of the Grampians, the opposite walls sometimes preserving\r\nan exact parallelism for a considerable distance. As a general rule,\r\nhowever, granite veins in all quarters of the globe are more sinuous in\r\ntheir course than those of trap. They present similar shapes at the\r\nmost northern point of Scotland, and the southernmost extremity of\r\nAfrica, as Figs. 612 and 613 will show.\r\n\r\nFig. 612: Granite veins traversing clay slate, Table Mountain, Cape of\r\nGood Hope. Fig. 612: Granite veins traversing clay slate, Table\r\nMountain, Cape of Good Hope.[6]\r\n\r\nFig. 613: Granite veins traversing gneiss, Cape Wrath. Fig. 613:\r\nGranite veins traversing gneiss, Cape Wrath.[7]\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for one set of granite veins to intersect another;\r\nand sometimes there are three sets, as in the environs of Heidelberg,\r\nwhere the granite on the banks of the river Necker is seen to consist\r\nof three varieties, differing in colour, grain, and various\r\npeculiarities of mineral composition. One of these, which is evidently\r\nthe second in age, is seen to cut through an older granite; and\r\nanother, still newer, traverses both the second and the first. In\r\nShetland there are two kinds of granite. One of them, composed of\r\nhornblende, mica, feldspar, and quartz, is of a dark colour, and is\r\nseen underlying gneiss. The other is a red granite, which penetrates\r\nthe dark variety everywhere in veins.[8]\r\n\r\nFig. 614 is a sketch of a group of granite veins in Cornwall, given by\r\nMessrs. Von Oeynhausen and Von Dechen.[9] The main body of the granite\r\nhere is of a porphyritic appearance, with large crystals of feldspar;\r\nbut in the veins it is fine-grained, and without these large crystals.\r\nThe general height of the veins is from 16 to 20 feet, but some are\r\nmuch higher.\r\n\r\nFig. 614: Granite veins passing through hornblende slate, Carnsilver\r\nCove, Cornwall.\r\n\r\nGranite, syenite, and those porphyries which have a granitiform\r\nstructure, in short all Plutonic rocks, are frequently observed to\r\ncontain metals, at or near their junction with stratified formations.\r\nOn the other hand, the veins which traverse stratified rocks are, as a\r\ngeneral law, more metalliferous near such junctions than in other\r\npositions. Hence it has been inferred that these metals may have been\r\nspread in a gaseous form through the fused mass, and that the contact\r\nof another rock, in a different state of temperature, or sometimes the\r\nexistence of rents in other rocks in the vicinity, may have caused the\r\nsublimation of the metals.[10]\r\n\r\nFig. 615: a, b. Quartz vein passing through gneiss and greenstone.\r\nTronstad Strand, near Christiania.\r\n\r\nVeins of pure quartz are often found in granite as in many stratified\r\nrocks, but they are not traceable, like veins of granite or trap, to\r\nlarge bodies of rock of similar composition. They appear to have been\r\ncracks, into which siliceous matter was infiltered. Such segregation,\r\nas it is called, can sometimes clearly be shown to have taken place\r\nlong subsequently to the original consolidation of the containing rock.\r\nThus, for example, I observed in the gneiss of Tronstad Strand, near\r\nDrammen, in Norway, the section on the beach shown in Figure 615. It\r\nappears that the alternating strata of whitish granitiform gneiss and\r\nblack hornblende-schist were first cut by a greenstone dike, about 2½\r\nfeet wide; then the crack _a, b,_ passed through all these rocks, and\r\nwas filled up with quartz. The opposite walls of the vein are in some\r\nparts incrusted with transparent crystals of quartz, the middle of the\r\nvein being filled up with common opaque white quartz.\r\n\r\nFig. 616: Euritic porphyry alternating with primary fossiliferous\r\nstrata, near Christiania.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the volcanic formations have been called overlying,\r\nbecause they not only penetrate others but spread over them. M. Necker\r\nhas proposed to call the granites the underlying igneous rocks, and the\r\ndistinction here indicated is highly characteristic. It was, indeed,\r\nsupposed by some of the earlier observers that the granite of\r\nChristiania, in Norway, was intercalated in mountain masses between the\r\nprimary or palæozoic strata of that country, so as to overlie\r\nfossiliferous shale and limestone. But although the granite sends veins\r\ninto these fossiliferous rocks, and is decidedly posterior in origin,\r\nits actual superposition in mass has been disproved by Professor\r\nKeilhau, whose observations on this controverted point I had\r\nopportunities, in 1837, of verifying. There are, however, on a smaller\r\nscale, certain beds of euritic porphyry, some a few feet, others many\r\nyards in thickness, which pass into granite, and deserve, perhaps, to\r\nbe classed as Plutonic rather than trappean rocks, which may truly be\r\ndescribed as interposed conformably between fossiliferous strata, as\r\nthe porphyries (_a, c,_ Fig. 616) which divide the bituminous shales\r\nand argillaceous limestones, _f, f._ But some of these same porphyries\r\nare partially unconformable, as _b,_ and may lead us to suspect that\r\nthe others also, notwithstanding their appearance of\r\ninterstratification, have been forcibly injected. Some of the\r\nporphyritic rocks above mentioned are highly quartzose, others very\r\nfeldspathic. In proportion as the masses are more voluminous, they\r\nbecome more granitic in their texture, less conformable, and even begin\r\nto send forth veins into contiguous strata. In a word, we have here a\r\nbeautiful illustration of the intermediate gradations between volcanic\r\nand Plutonic rocks, not only in their mineralogical composition and\r\nstructure, but also in their relations of position to associated\r\nformations. If the term “overlying” can in this instance be applied to\r\na Plutonic rock, it is only in proportion as that rock begins to\r\nacquire a trappean aspect.\r\n\r\nIt has been already hinted that the heat which in every active volcano\r\nextends downward to indefinite depths must produce simultaneously very\r\ndifferent effects near the surface and far below it; and we cannot\r\nsuppose that rocks resulting from the crystallising of fused matter\r\nunder a pressure of several thousand feet, much less several miles, of\r\nthe earth’s crust can exactly resemble those formed at or near the\r\nsurface. Hence the production at great depths of a class of rocks\r\nanalogous to the volcanic, and yet differing in many particulars, might\r\nhave been predicted, even had we no Plutonic formations to account for.\r\nHow well these agree, both in their positive and negative characters,\r\nwith the theory of their deep subterranean origin, the student will be\r\nable to judge by considering the descriptions already given.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been objected, that if the granitic and volcanic rocks\r\nwere simply different parts of one great series, we ought to find in\r\nmountain chains volcanic dikes passing upward into lava and downward\r\ninto granite. But we may answer that our vertical sections are usually\r\nof small extent; and if we find in certain places a transition from\r\ntrap to porous lava, and in others a passage from granite to trap, it\r\nis as much as could be expected of this evidence.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious extent of denudation which has been already demonstrated\r\nto have occurred at former periods, will reconcile the student to the\r\nbelief that crystalline rocks of high antiquity, although deep in the\r\nearth’s crust when originally formed, may have become uncovered and\r\nexposed at the surface. Their actual elevation above the sea may be\r\nreferred to the same causes to which we have attributed the upheaval of\r\nmarine strata, even to the summits of some mountain chains.\r\n\r\n [1] Delesse, Ann. des Mines, 1852, tome iii, p. 409, and 1848, tome\r\n xiii, p. 675.\r\n\r\n [2] Bulletin, 2e série, iv, 1304; and D’Archiac, Hist. des Progrès de\r\n la Géol., i, 38.\r\n\r\n [3] See Quart.

We must bear in mind that the evidence of the age of each\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic rock was derived either from lavas poured out\r\nupon the ancient surface, whether in the sea or in the atmosphere, or\r\nfrom tuffs and conglomerates, also deposited at the surface, and either\r\ncontaining organic remains themselves or intercalated between strata\r\ncontaining fossils. But the same tests entirely fail, or are only\r\napplicable in a modified degree, when we endeavour to fix the\r\nchronology of a rock which has crystallised from a state of fusion in\r\nthe bowels of the earth. In that case we are reduced to the tests of\r\nrelative position, intrusion, alteration of the rocks in contact,\r\nincluded fragments, and mineral character; but all these may yield at\r\nbest a somewhat ambiguous result.\r\n\r\nTest of Age by Relative Position.—Unaltered fossiliferous strata of\r\nevery age are met with reposing immediately on Plutonic rocks; as at\r\nChristiania, in Norway, where the Post-pliocene deposits rest on\r\ngranite; in Auvergne, where the fresh-water Miocene strata, and at\r\nHeidelberg, on the Rhine, where the New Red sandstone occupy a similar\r\nplace. In all these, and similar instances, inferiority in position is\r\nconnected with the superior antiquity of granite. The crystalline rock\r\nwas solid before the sedimentary beds were superimposed, and the latter\r\nusually contain in them rounded pebbles of the subjacent granite.\r\n\r\nTest by Intrusion and Alteration.—But when Plutonic rocks send veins\r\ninto strata, and alter them near the point of contact, in the manner\r\nbefore described (p. 559), it is clear that, like intrusive traps, they\r\nare newer than the strata which they invade and alter. Examples of the\r\napplication of this test will be given in the sequel.\r\n\r\nTest by Mineral Composition.—Notwithstanding a general uniformity in\r\nthe aspect of Plutonic rocks, we have seen in the last chapter that\r\nthere are many varieties, such as syenite, talcose granite, and others.\r\nOne of these varieties is sometimes found exclusively prevailing\r\nthroughout an extensive region, where it preserves a homogeneous\r\ncharacter; so that, having ascertained its relative age in one place,\r\nwe can recognise its identity in others, and thus determine from a\r\nsingle section the chronological relations of large mountain masses.\r\nHaving observed, for example, that the syenitic granite of Norway, in\r\nwhich the mineral called zircon abounds, has altered the Silurian\r\nstrata wherever it is in contact, we do not hesitate to refer other\r\nmasses of the same zircon-syenite in the south of Norway to a\r\npost-Silurian date. Some have imagined that the age of different\r\ngranites might, to a great extent, be determined by their mineral\r\ncharacters alone; syenite, for instance, or granite with hornblende,\r\nbeing more modern than common or micaceous granite. But modern\r\ninvestigations have proved these generalisations to have been\r\npremature.\r\n\r\nTest by Included Fragments.—This criterion can rarely be of much\r\nimportance, because the fragments involved in granite are usually so\r\nmuch altered that they cannot be referred with certainty to the rocks\r\nwhence they were derived. In the White Mountains, in North America,\r\naccording to Professor Hubbard, a granite vein, traversing granite,\r\ncontains fragments of slate and trap which must have fallen into the\r\nfissure when the fused materials of the vein were injected from\r\nbelow,[1] and thus the granite is shown to be newer than those slaty\r\nand trappean formations from which the fragments were derived.\r\n\r\nRecent and Pliocene Plutonic Rocks, why invisible.—The explanations\r\nalready given in the 28th and in the last chapter of the probable\r\nrelation of the Plutonic to the volcanic formations, will naturally\r\nlead the reader to infer that rocks of the one class can never be\r\nproduced at or near the surface without some members of the other being\r\nformed below. It is not uncommon for lava-streams to require more than\r\nten years to cool in the open air; and where they are of great\r\n\r\ndepth, a much longer period. The melted matter poured from Jorullo, in\r\nMexico, in the year 1759, which accumulated in some places to the\r\nheight of 550 feet, was found to retain a high temperature half a\r\ncentury after the eruption.[2] We may conceive, therefore, that great\r\nmasses of subterranean lava may remain in a red-hot or incandescent\r\nstate in the volcanic foci for immense periods, and the process of\r\nrefrigeration may be extremely gradual. Sometimes, indeed, this process\r\nmay be retarded for an indefinite period by the accession of fresh\r\nsupplies of heat; for we find that the lava in the crater of Stromboli,\r\none of the Lipari Islands, has been in a state of constant ebullition\r\nfor the last two thousand years; and we may suppose this fluid mass to\r\ncommunicate with some caldron or reservoir of fused matter below. In\r\nthe Isle of Bourbon, also, where there has been an emission of lava\r\nonce in every two years for a long period, the lava below can scarcely\r\nfail to have been permanently in a state of liquefaction. If then it be\r\na reasonable conjecture, that about 2000 volcanic eruptions occur in\r\nthe course of every century, either above the waters of the sea or\r\nbeneath them,[3] it will follow that the quantity of Plutonic rock\r\ngenerated or in progress during the Recent epoch must already have been\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nBut as the Plutonic rocks originate at some depth in the earth’s crust,\r\nthey can only be rendered accessible to human observation by subsequent\r\nupheaval and denudation. Between the period when a Plutonic rock\r\ncrystallises in the subterranean regions and the era of its protrusion\r\nat any single point of the surface, one or two geological periods must\r\nusually intervene. Hence, we must not expect to find the Recent or even\r\nthe Pliocene granites laid open to view, unless we are prepared to\r\nassume that sufficient time has elapsed since the commencement of the\r\nPliocene period for great upheaval and denudation. A Plutonic rock,\r\ntherefore, must, in general, be of considerable antiquity relatively to\r\nthe fossiliferous and volcanic formations, before it becomes\r\nextensively visible. As we know that the upheaval of land has been\r\nsometimes accompanied in South America by volcanic eruptions and the\r\nemission of lava, we may conceive the more ancient Plutonic rocks to be\r\nforced upward to the surface by the newer rocks of the same class\r\nformed successively below—subterposition in the Plutonic, like\r\nsuperposition in the sedimentary rocks, being usually characteristic of\r\na newer origin.\r\n\r\nFig. 617: Diagram showing the relative position which the Plutonic and\r\nsedimentary formations of different ages may occupy.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 617 an attempt is made to show the inverted order in which\r\nsedimentary and Plutonic formations may occur in the earth’s crust. The\r\noldest Plutonic rock, No. I, has been upheaved at successive periods\r\nuntil it has become exposed to view in a mountain-chain. This\r\nprotrusion of No. I has been caused by the igneous agency which\r\nproduced the newer Plutonic rocks Nos. II, III and IV. Part of the\r\nprimary fossiliferous strata, No. I, have also been raised to the\r\nsurface by the same gradual process. It will be observed that the\r\nRecent _strata_ No. 4 and the Recent _ granite_ or Plutonic rock No. IV\r\nare the most remote from each other in position, although of\r\ncontemporaneous date. According to this hypothesis, the convulsions of\r\nmany periods will be required before Recent or Post-tertiary granite\r\nwill be upraised so as to form the highest ridges and central axes of\r\nmountain-chains. During that time the _recent_ strata No. 4 might be\r\ncovered by a great many newer sedimentary formations.\r\n\r\nMiocene Plutonic Rocks.—A considerable mass of syenite, in the Isle of\r\nSkye, is described by Dr. MacCulloch as intersecting limestone and\r\nshale, which are of the age of the lias. The limestone, which at a\r\ngreater distance from the granite contains shells, exhibits no traces\r\nof them near its junction, where it has been converted into a pure\r\ncrystalline marble.[4] MacCulloch pointed out that the syenite here, as\r\nin Raasay, was newer than the secondary rocks, and Mr. Geikie has since\r\nshown that there is a strong probability that this Plutonic rock may be\r\nof Miocene age, because a similar Syenite having a true granitic\r\ncharacter in its crystallisation has modified the Tertiary volcanic\r\nrocks of Ben More, in Mull, some of which have undergone considerable\r\nmetamorphism.\r\n\r\nEocene Plutonic Rocks.—In a former part of this volume (Chapter 16),\r\nthe great nummulitic formation of the Alps and Pyrenees was referred to\r\nthe Eocene period, and it follows that vast movements which have raised\r\nthose fossiliferous rocks from the level of the sea to the height of\r\nmore than 10,000 feet above its level have taken place since the\r\ncommencement of the Tertiary epoch. Here, therefore, if anywhere, we\r\nmight expect to find hypogene formations of Eocene date breaking out in\r\nthe central axis or most disturbed region of the loftiest chain in\r\nEurope. Accordingly, in the Swiss Alps, even the _flysch,_ or upper\r\nportion of the nummulitic series, has been occasionally invaded by\r\nPlutonic rocks, and converted into crystalline schists of the hypogene\r\nclass. There can be little doubt that even the talcose granite or\r\ngneiss of Mont Blanc itself has been in a fused or pasty state since\r\nthe _flysch_ was deposited at the bottom of the sea; and the question\r\nas to its age is not so much whether it be a secondary or tertiary\r\ngranite or gneiss, as whether it should be assigned to the Eocene or\r\nMiocene epoch.\r\n\r\nGreat upheaving movements have been experienced in the region of the\r\nAndes, during the Post-tertiary period. In some part, therefore, of\r\nthis chain, we may expect to discover tertiary Plutonic rocks laid open\r\nto view; and Mr. Darwin’s account of the Chilian Andes, to which the\r\nreader may refer, fully realises this expectation: for he shows that we\r\nhave strong ground to presume that Plutonic rocks there exposed on a\r\nlarge scale are of later date than certain Secondary and Tertiary\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nBut the theory adopted in this work of the subterranean origin of the\r\nhypogene formations would be untenable, if the supposed fact here\r\nalluded to, of the appearance of tertiary granite at the surface, was\r\nnot a rare exception to the general rule. A considerable lapse of time\r\nmust intervene between the formation of Plutonic and metamorphic rocks\r\nin the nether regions and their emergence at the surface. For a long\r\nseries of subterranean movements must occur before such rocks can be\r\nuplifted into the atmosphere or the ocean; and, before they can be\r\nrendered visible to man, some strata which previously covered them must\r\nhave been stripped off by denudation.\r\n\r\nWe know that in the Bay of Baiæ in 1538, in Cutch in 1819, and on\r\nseveral occasions in Peru and Chili, since the commencement of the\r\npresent century, the permanent upheaval or subsidence of land has been\r\naccompanied by the simultaneous emission of lava at one or more points\r\nin the same volcanic region. From these and other examples it may be\r\ninferred that the rising or sinking of the earth’s crust, operations by\r\nwhich sea is converted into land, and land into sea, are a part only of\r\nthe consequences of subterranean igneous action. It can scarcely be\r\ndoubted that this action consists, in a great degree, of the baking,\r\nand occasionally the liquefaction, of rocks, causing them to assume, in\r\nsome cases a larger, in others a smaller volume than before the\r\napplication of heat. It consists also in the generation of gases, and\r\ntheir expansion by heat, and the injection of liquid matter into rents\r\nformed in superincumbent rocks. The prodigious scale on which these\r\nsubterranean causes have operated in Sicily since the deposition of the\r\nNewer Pliocene strata will be appreciated when we remember that\r\nthroughout half the surface of that island such strata are met with,\r\nraised to the height of from 50 to that of 2000 and even 3000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. In the same island also the older rocks\r\nwhich are contiguous to these marine tertiary strata must have\r\nundergone, within the same period, a similar amount of upheaval.\r\n\r\nThe like observations may be extended to nearly the whole of Europe,\r\nfor, since the commencement of the Eocene Period, the entire European\r\narea, including some of the central and very lofty portions of the Alps\r\nthemselves, as I have elsewhere shown,[5] has, with the exception of a\r\nfew districts, emerged from the deep to its present altitude. There\r\nmust, therefore, have been at great depths in the earth’s crust, within\r\nthe same period, an amount of subterranean change corresponding to this\r\nvast alteration of level affecting a whole continent.\r\n\r\nThe principal effect of subterranean movements during the Tertiary\r\nPeriod seems to have consisted in the upheaval of hypogene formations\r\nof an age anterior to the Carboniferous. The repetition of another\r\nseries of movements, of equal violence, might upraise the Plutonic and\r\nmetamorphic rocks of many secondary periods; and, if the same force\r\nshould still continue to act, the next convulsions might bring up to\r\nthe day the _tertiary_ and _ recent_ hypogene rocks. In the course of\r\nsuch changes many of the existing sedimentary strata would suffer\r\ngreatly by denudation, others might assume a metamorphic structure, or\r\nbecome melted down into Plutonic and volcanic rocks. Meanwhile the\r\ndeposition of a great thickness of new strata would not fail to take\r\nplace during the upheaval and partial destruction of the older rocks.\r\nBut I must refer the reader to the last chapter but one of this volume\r\nfor a fuller explanation of these views.\r\n\r\nFig. 618: Section through three layers (b, c, d) of the Cretaceous\r\nseries over granite (A).\r\nPlutonic Rocks of Cretaceous Period.—It will be shown in the next\r\nchapter that chalk, as well as lias, has been altered by granite in the\r\neastern Pyrenees. Whether such granite be cretaceous or tertiary,\r\ncannot easily be decided. Suppose _b, c, d,_ Fig. 618, to be three\r\nmembers of the Cretaceous series, the lowest of which, _b,_ has been\r\naltered by the granite A, the modifying influence not having extended\r\nso far as _c,_ or having but slightly affected its lowest beds. Now it\r\ncan rarely be possible for the geologist to decide whether the beds _d_\r\nexisted at the time of the intrusion of A, and alteration of _ b_ and\r\n_c,_ or whether they were subsequently thrown down upon _c._ But as\r\nsome Cretaceous and even Tertiary rocks have been raised to the height\r\nof more than 9000 feet in the Pyrenees, we must not assume that\r\nplutonic formations of the same periods may not have been brought up\r\nand exposed by denudation, at the height of 2000 or 3000 feet on the\r\nflanks of that chain.\r\n\r\nFig. 619: Junction of granite with Jurassic or Oolite strata in the\r\nAlps, near Champoleon.\r\n\r\nPlutonic Rocks of the Oolite and Lias.—In the Department of the Hautes\r\nAlpes, in France, M. Élie de Beaumont traced a black argillaceous\r\nlimestone, charged with belemnites, to within a few yards of a mass of\r\ngranite. Here the limestone begins to put on a granular texture, but is\r\nextremely fine-grained. When nearer the junction it becomes grey, and\r\nhas a saccharoid structure. In another locality, near Champoleon, a\r\ngranite composed of quartz, black mica, and rose-coloured feldspar is\r\nobserved partly to overlie the secondary rocks, producing an alteration\r\nwhich extends for about 30 feet downward, diminishing in the beds which\r\nlie farthest from the granite. (See Fig. 619.) In the altered mass the\r\nargillaceous beds are hardened, the limestone is saccharoid, the grits\r\nquartzose, and in the midst of them is a thin layer of an imperfect\r\ngranite. It is also an important circumstance that near the point of\r\ncontact, both the granite and the secondary rocks become metalliferous,\r\nand contain nests and small veins of blende, galena, iron, and copper\r\npyrites. The stratified rocks become harder and more crystalline, but\r\nthe granite, on the contrary, softer and less perfectly crystallised\r\nnear the junction.[6] Although the granite is incumbent in the section\r\n(Fig. 619), we cannot assume that it overflowed the strata, for the\r\ndisturbances of the rocks are so great in this part of the Alps that\r\ntheir original position is often inverted.\r\n\r\nAt Predazzo, in the Tyrol, secondary strata, some of which are\r\nlimestones of the Oolitic period, have been traversed and altered by\r\nPlutonic rocks, one portion of which is an augitic porphyry, which\r\npasses insensibly into granite. The limestone is changed into granular\r\nmarble, with a band of serpentine at the junction.[7]\r\n\r\nPlutonic Rocks of Carboniferous Period.—The granite of Dartmoor, in\r\nDevonshire, was formerly supposed to be one of the most ancient of the\r\nPlutonic rocks, but is now ascertained to be posterior in date to the\r\nculm-measures of that county, which from their position, and, as\r\ncontaining true coal-plants, are now known to be members of the true\r\nCarboniferous series. This granite, like the syenitic granite of\r\nChristiania, has broken through the stratified formations, on the\r\nnorth-west side of Dartmoor, the successive members of the\r\nculm-measures abutting against the granite, and becoming metamorphic as\r\nthey approach. These strata are also penetrated by granite veins, and\r\nPlutonic dikes, called “elvans.”[8] The granite of Cornwall is probably\r\nof the same date, and, therefore, as modern as the Carboniferous\r\nstrata, if not newer.\r\n\r\nFig. 620: Section through Silurian strata and Granite.\r\n\r\nPlutonic Rocks of Silurian Period.—It has long been known that a very\r\nancient granite near Christiania, in Norway, is posterior in date to\r\nthe Lower Silurian strata of that region, although its exact position\r\nin the Palæozoic series cannot be defined. Von Buch first announced, in\r\n1813, that it was of newer origin than certain limestones containing\r\northocerata and trilobites. The proofs consist in the penetration of\r\ngranite veins into the shale and limestone, and the alteration of the\r\nstrata, for a considerable distance from the point of contact, both of\r\nthese veins and the central mass from which they emanate. (See p. 562)\r\nVon Buch supposed that the Plutonic rock alternated with the\r\nfossiliferous strata, and that large masses of granite were sometimes\r\nincumbent upon the strata; but this idea was erroneous, and arose from\r\nthe fact that the beds of shale and limestone often dip towards the\r\ngranite up to the point of contact, appearing as if they would pass\r\nunder it in mass, as at _a,_ Fig. 620, and then again on the opposite\r\nside of the same mountain, as at _b,_ dip away from the same granite.\r\nWhen the junctions, however, are carefully examined, it is found that\r\nthe Plutonic rock intrudes itself in veins, and nowhere covers the\r\nfossiliferous strata in large overlying masses, as is so commonly the\r\ncase with trappean formations.[9]\r\n\r\nNow this granite, which is more modern than the Silurian strata of\r\nNorway, also sends veins in the same country into an ancient formation\r\nof gneiss; and the relations of the Plutonic rock and the gneiss, at\r\ntheir junction, are full of interest when we duly consider the wide\r\ndifference of epoch which must have separated their origin.\r\n\r\nFig. 621: Granite sending veins into Silurian strata and gneiss.\r\nChristiania, Norway.\r\n\r\nThe length of this interval of time is attested by the following facts:\r\nThe fossiliferous, or Silurian, beds rest unconformably upon the\r\ntruncated edges of the gneiss, the inclined strata of which had been\r\ndenuded before the sedimentary beds were superimposed (see Figure 621).\r\nThe signs of denudation are twofold; first, the surface of the gneiss\r\nis seen occasionally, on the removal of the newer beds containing\r\norganic remains, to be worn and smoothed; secondly, pebbles of gneiss\r\nhave been found in some of these Silurian strata. Between the origin,\r\ntherefore, of the gneiss and the granite there intervened, first, the\r\nperiod when the strata of gneiss were denuded; secondly, the period of\r\nthe deposition of the Silurian deposits upon the denuded and inclined\r\ngneiss, a. Yet the granite produced after this long interval is often\r\nso intimately blended with the ancient gneiss, at the point of\r\njunction, that it is impossible to draw any other than an arbitrary\r\nline of separation between them; and where this is not the case,\r\ntortuous veins of granite pass freely through gneiss, ending sometimes\r\nin threads, as if the older rock had offered no resistance to their\r\npassage. These appearances may probably be due to hydrothermal action\r\n(see p. 584). I shall merely observe in this place that had such\r\njunctions alone been visible, and had we not learnt, from other\r\nsections, how long a period elapsed between the consolidation of the\r\ngneiss and the injection of this granite, we might have suspected that\r\nthe gneiss was scarcely solidified, or had not yet assumed its complete\r\nmetamorphic character when invaded by the Plutonic rock. From this\r\nexample we may learn how impossible it is to conjecture whether certain\r\ngranites in Scotland, and other countries, which send veins into gneiss\r\nand other metamorphic rocks, are primary, or whether they may not\r\nbelong to some secondary or tertiary period.\r\n\r\nOldest Granites.—It is not half a century since the doctrine was very\r\ngeneral that all granitic rocks were _ primitive,_ that is to say, that\r\nthey originated before the deposition of the first sedimentary strata,\r\nand before the creation of organic beings (see p. 34). But so greatly\r\nare our views now changed, that we find it no easy task to point out a\r\nsingle mass of granite demonstrably more ancient than known\r\nfossiliferous deposits. Could we discover some Laurentian strata\r\nresting immediately on granite, there being no alterations at the point\r\nof contact, nor any intersecting granitic veins, we might then affirm\r\nthe Plutonic rock to have originated before the oldest known\r\nfossiliferous strata. Still it would be presumptuous, as we have\r\nalready pointed out (p. 464), to suppose that when a small part only of\r\nthe globe has been investigated, we are acquainted with the oldest\r\nfossiliferous strata in the crust of our planet. Even when these are\r\nfound, we cannot assume that there never were any antecedent strata\r\ncontaining organic remains, which may have become metamorphic. If we\r\nfind pebbles of granite in a conglomerate of the Lower Laurentian\r\nsystem, we may then feel assured that the parent granite was formed\r\nbefore the Laurentian formation. But if the incumbent strata be merely\r\nCambrian or Silurian, the fundamental granite, although of high\r\nantiquity, may be posterior in date to _known_ fossiliferous\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nProtrusion of Solid Granite.—In part of Sutherlandshire, near Brora,\r\ncommon granite, composed of feldspar, quartz, and mica is in immediate\r\ncontact with Oolitic strata, and has clearly been elevated to the\r\nsurface at a period subsequent to the deposition of those strata.[10]\r\nProfessor Sedgwick and Sir R. Murchison conceive that this granite has\r\nbeen upheaved in a solid form; and that in breaking through the\r\nsubmarine deposits, with which it was not perhaps originally in\r\ncontact, it has fractured them so as to form a breccia along the line\r\nof junction. This breccia consists of fragments of shale, sandstone,\r\nand limestone, with fossils of the oolite, all united together by a\r\ncalcareous cement. The secondary strata at some distance from the\r\ngranite are but slightly disturbed, but in proportion to their\r\nproximity the amount of dislocation becomes greater.\r\n\r\nMr. T. McKenney Hughes has suggested to me in explanation of these\r\nphenomena that they may be the effect of the association of more pliant\r\nstrata with hard unyielding rocks, the whole of which were subjected\r\nsimultaneously to great movements, whether of elevation or subsidence,\r\nand of lateral pressure, during which the more solid granite, being\r\nincapable of compression, was forced through the softer beds of shale,\r\nsandstone, and limestone. He remarks that similar breccias with\r\nslickensides are observed on a minor scale where rocks of different\r\ncomposition and rigidity are contorted together. Such protrusion may\r\nhave been brought about by degrees by innumerable shocks of earthquakes\r\nrepeated after long intervals of time along the same tract of country.\r\nThe opening of new fissures in the hardest rocks is a frequent\r\naccompaniment of such convulsions, and during the consequent\r\nvibrations, breccias must often be caused. But these catastrophes, as\r\nwe well know, do not imply that the land or sea of the disturbed region\r\nare rendered uninhabitable by living beings, and by no means indicate a\r\nstate of things different from that witnessed in the ordinary course of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n [1] Silliman’s Journ., No. 69, p. 123.\r\n\r\n [2] See “Principles,” _Index,_ “Jorullo.”\r\n\r\n [3] Ibid., “Volcanic Eruptions.”\r\n\r\n [4] “Western Islands,” vol. i, p. 330.\r\n\r\n [5] See map of Europe, and explanation, in Principles, book i.\r\n\r\n [6] Élie de Beaumont sur les Montagnes de l’Oisans, etc. Mém. de la\r\n Soc. d’Hist.

They who still question this opinion may call the\r\nrocks under consideration the stratified hypogene formations or\r\ncrystalline schists.\r\n\r\nThese rocks, when in their characteristic or normal state, are wholly\r\ndevoid of organic remains, and contain no distinct fragments of other\r\nrocks, whether rounded or angular. They sometimes break out in the\r\ncentral parts of mountain chains, but in other cases extend over areas\r\nof vast dimensions, occupying, for example, nearly the whole of Norway\r\nand Sweden, where, as in Brazil, they appear alike in the lower and\r\nhigher grounds. However crystalline these rocks may become in certain\r\nregions, they never, like granite or trap, send veins into contiguous\r\nformations. In Great Britain, those members of the series which\r\napproach most nearly to granite in their composition, as gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, and hornblende-schist, are confined to the country north\r\nof the rivers Forth and Clyde.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to trace a general order of succession or\r\nsuperposition in the members of this family; clay-slate, for example,\r\nhaving been often supposed to hold invariably a higher geological\r\nposition than mica-schist, and mica-schist to overlie gneiss. But\r\nalthough such an order may prevail throughout limited districts, it is\r\nby no means universal. To this subject, however, I shall again revert,\r\nin Chapter XXXV, where the chronological relations of the metamorphic\r\nrocks are pointed out.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Metamorphic Rocks.—The following may be enumerated as the\r\nprincipal members of the metamorphic class:—gneiss, mica-schist,\r\nhornblende-schist, clay-slate, chlorite-schist, hypogene or metamorphic\r\nlimestone, and certain kinds of quartz-rock or quartzite.\r\n\r\nFig. 622: Fragment of gneiss; section made at right angles to the\r\nplanes of foliation.\r\n\r\n_Gneiss._—The first of these, gneiss, may be called stratified—or by\r\nthose who object to that term, foliated—granite, being formed of the\r\nsame materials as granite, namely, feldspar, quartz, and mica. In the\r\nspecimen in Fig. 622, the white layers consist almost exclusively of\r\ngranular feldspar, with here and there a speck of mica and grain of\r\nquartz. The dark layers are composed of grey quartz and black mica,\r\nwith occasionally a grain of feldspar intermixed. The rock splits most\r\neasily in the plane of these darker layers, and the surface thus\r\nexposed is almost entirely covered with shining spangles of mica. The\r\naccompanying quartz, however, greatly predominates in quantity, but the\r\nmost ready cleavage is determined by the abundance of mica in certain\r\nparts of the dark layer. Instead of consisting of these thin laminæ,\r\ngneiss is sometimes simply divided into thick beds, in which the mica\r\nhas only a slight degree of parallelism to the planes of\r\nstratification.\r\n\r\nHand specimens may often be obtained from such gneiss which are\r\nundistinguishable from granite, affording an argument to which we shall\r\nallude in the concluding part of this chapter, in favour of those who\r\nregard all granite and syenite not as igneous rocks, but as aqueous\r\nformations so altered as to have lost all signs of their original\r\nstratified arrangement. Gneiss in geology is commonly used to designate\r\nnot merely stratified and foliated rocks having the same component\r\nmaterials as granite or syenite, but also in a wider sense to embrace\r\nthe formation with which other members of the metamorphic series, such\r\nas hornblende-schist, may alternate, and which are then considered\r\nsubordinate to the true gneiss.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of rock allied to gneiss, into which feldspar\r\nenters as an essential ingredient, will be understood by referring to\r\nwhat was said of granite. Thus, for example, hornblende may be\r\nsuperadded to mica, quartz, and feldspar, forming a hornblendic or\r\nsyenitic gneiss; or talc may be substituted for mica, constituting\r\ntalcose gneiss (called stratified protogine by the French), a rock\r\ncomposed of feldspar, quartz, and talc, in distinct crystals or grains.\r\n\r\n_Eurite,_ which has already been mentioned as a Plutonic rock, occurs\r\nalso with precisely the same composition in beds subordinate to gneiss\r\nor mica-slate.\r\n\r\n_Hornblende-schist_ is usually black, and composed principally of\r\nhornblende, with a variable quantity of feldspar, and sometimes grains\r\nof quartz. When the hornblende and feldspar are in nearly equal\r\nquantities, and the rock is not slaty, it corresponds in character with\r\nthe greenstones of the trap family, and has been called “primitive\r\ngreenstone.” It may be termed hornblende rock, or amphibolite. Some of\r\nthese hornblendic masses may really have been volcanic rocks, which\r\nhave since assumed a more crystalline or metamorphic texture.\r\n\r\n_Serpentine_ is a greenish rock, a silicate of magnesia, in which there\r\nis sometimes from 30 to 40 per cent of magnesia. It enters largely into\r\nthe composition of a trap dike cutting through Old Red Sandstone in\r\nForfarshire, and in that case is probably an altered basaltic dike\r\nwhich had contained much olivine. The theory of its having been\r\noriginally a volcanic product subsequently altered by metamorphism may\r\nat first sight seem inconsistent with its occurrence in large and\r\nregularly stratified masses in the metamorphic series in Scotland, as\r\nin Aberdeenshire. But it has been suggested in explanation that such\r\nserpentine may have been originally regularly-bedded trap tuff, and\r\nvolcanic breccia, with much olivine, which would still retain a\r\nstratified appearance after their conversion into a metamorphic rock.\r\n\r\n_Actinolite Schist_ is a slaty foliated rock, composed chiefly of\r\nactinolite, an emerald-green mineral, allied to hornblende, with some\r\nadmixture of garnet, mica, and quartz.\r\n\r\n_Mica-schist_ or _Micaceous Schist_ is, next to gneiss, one of the most\r\nabundant rocks of the metamorphic series. It is slaty, essentially\r\ncomposed of mica and quartz, the mica sometimes appearing to constitute\r\nthe whole mass. Beds of pure quartz also occur in this formation. In\r\nsome districts, garnets in regular twelve-sided crystals form an\r\nintegrant part of mica-schist. This rock passes by insensible\r\ngradations into clay-slate.\r\n\r\n_Clay-slate—Argillaceous Schist—Argillite._—This rock sometimes\r\nresembles an indurated clay or shale. It is for the most part extremely\r\nfissile, often affording good roofing-slate. Occasionally it derives a\r\nshining and silky lustre from the minute particles of mica or talc\r\nwhich it contains. It varies from greenish or bluish-grey to a lead\r\ncolour; and it may be said of this, more than of any other schist, that\r\nit is common to the metamorphic and fossiliferous series, for some\r\nclay-slates taken from each division would not be distinguishable by\r\nmineral characters alone. It is not uncommon to meet with an\r\nargillaceous rock having the same composition, without the slaty\r\ncleavage, which may be called argillite.\r\n\r\n_Chlorite Schist_ is a green slaty rock, in which chlorite is abundant\r\nin foliated plates, usually blended with minute grains of quartz, or\r\nsometimes with feldspar or mica; often associated with, and graduating\r\ninto, gneiss and clay-slate.\r\n\r\n_Quartzite,_ or _Quartz Rock,_ is an aggregate of grains of quartz\r\nwhich are either in minute crystals, or in many cases slightly rounded,\r\noccurring in regular strata, associated with gneiss or other\r\nmetamorphic rocks. Compact quartz, like that so frequently found in\r\nveins, is also found together with granular quartzite. Both of these\r\nalternate with gneiss or mica-schist, or pass into those rocks by the\r\naddition of mica, or of feldspar and mica.\r\n\r\n_Crystalline,_ or _Metamorphic Limestone._—This hypogene rock, called\r\nby the earlier geologists _primary limestone,_ is sometimes a white\r\ncrystalline granular marble, which when in thick beds can be used in\r\nsculpture; but more frequently it occurs in thin beds, forming a\r\nfoliated schist much resembling in colour and arrangement certain\r\nvarieties of gneiss and mica-schist. When it alternates with these\r\nrocks, it often contains some crystals of mica, and occasionally\r\nquartz, feldspar, hornblende, talc, chlorite, garnet, and other\r\nminerals. It enters sparingly into the structure of the hypogene\r\ndistricts of Norway, Sweden, and Scotland, but is largely developed in\r\nthe Alps.\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Metamorphic Strata.—Having said thus much of the mineral\r\ncomposition of the metamorphic rocks, I may combine what remains to be\r\nsaid of their structure and history with an account of the opinions\r\nentertained of their probable origin. At the same time, it may be well\r\nto forewarn the reader that we are here entering upon ground of\r\ncontroversy, and soon reach the limits where positive induction ends,\r\nand beyond which we can only indulge in speculations. It was once a\r\nfavourite doctrine, and is still maintained by many, that these rocks\r\nowe their crystalline texture, their want of all signs of a mechanical\r\norigin, or of fossil contents, to a peculiar and nascent condition of\r\nthe planet at the period of their formation. The arguments in\r\nrefutation of this hypothesis will be more fully considered when I\r\nshow, in Chapter XXXV, to how many different ages the metamorphic\r\nformations are referable, and how gneiss, mica-schist, clay-slate, and\r\nhypogene limestone (that of Carrara, for example) have been formed, not\r\nonly since the first introduction of organic beings into this planet,\r\nbut even long after many distinct races of plants and animals had\r\nflourished and passed away in succession.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine respecting the crystalline strata implied in the name\r\nmetamorphic may properly be treated of in this place; and we must first\r\ninquire whether these rocks are really entitled to be called stratified\r\nin the strict sense of having been originally deposited as sediment\r\nfrom water. The general adoption by geologists of the term stratified,\r\nas applied to these rocks, sufficiently attests their division into\r\nbeds very analogous, at least in form, to ordinary fossiliferous\r\nstrata. This resemblance is by no means confined to the existence in\r\nboth occasionally of a laminated structure, but extends to every kind\r\nof arrangement which is compatible with the absence of fossils, and of\r\nsand, pebbles, ripple-mark, and other characters which the metamorphic\r\ntheory supposes to have been obliterated by Plutonic action. Thus, for\r\nexample, we behold alike in the crystalline and fossiliferous\r\nformations an alternation of beds varying greatly in composition,\r\ncolour, and thickness. We observe, for instance, gneiss alternating\r\nwith layers of black hornblende-schist or of green chlorite-schist, or\r\nwith granular quartz or limestone; and the interchange of these\r\ndifferent strata may be repeated for an indefinite number of times. In\r\nthe like manner, mica-schist alternates with chlorite-schist, and with\r\nbeds of pure quartz or of granular limestone. We have already seen\r\nthat, near the immediate contact of granitic veins and volcanic dikes,\r\nvery extraordinary alterations in rocks have taken place, more\r\nespecially in the neighbourhood of granite. It will be useful here to\r\nadd other illustrations, showing that a texture undistinguishable from\r\nthat which characterises the more crystalline metamorphic formations\r\nhas actually been superinduced in strata once fossiliferous.\r\n\r\nFossiliferous Strata rendered metamorphic by intrusive Masses of\r\nGranite.—In the southern extremity of Norway there is a large district,\r\non the west side of the fiord of Christiania, which I visited in 1837\r\nwith the late Professor Keilhau, in which syenitic granite protrudes in\r\nmountain masses through fossiliferous strata, and usually sends veins\r\ninto them at the point of contact. The stratified rocks, replete with\r\nshells and zoophytes, consist chiefly of shale, limestone, and some\r\nsandstone, and all these are invariably altered near the granite for a\r\ndistance of from 50 to 400 yards. The aluminous shales are hardened,\r\nand have become flinty. Sometimes they resemble jasper. Ribboned jasper\r\nis produced by the hardening of alternate layers of green and\r\nchocolate-coloured schist, each stripe faithfully representing the\r\noriginal lines of stratification. Nearer the granite the schist often\r\ncontains crystals of hornblende, which are even met with in some places\r\nfor a distance of several hundred yards from the junction; and this\r\nblack hornblende is so abundant that eminent geologists, when passing\r\nthrough the country, have confounded it with the ancient\r\nhornblende-schist, subordinate to the great gneiss formation of Norway.\r\nFrequently, between the granite and the hornblende-slate\r\nabove-mentioned, grains of mica and crystalline feldspar appear in the\r\nschist, so that rocks resembling gneiss and mica-schist are produced.\r\nFossils can rarely be detected in these schists, and they are more\r\ncompletely effaced in proportion to the more crystalline texture of the\r\nbeds, and their vicinity to the granite.\r\n\r\nFig. 623: Ground-plan of altered slate and limestone near granite.\r\nChristiania. The arrows indicate the dip, and the oblique lines the\r\nstrike of the beds.\r\n\r\nIn some places the siliceous matter of the schist becomes a granular\r\nquartz; and when hornblende and mica are added, the altered rock loses\r\nits stratification, and passes into a kind of granite. The limestone,\r\nwhich at points remote from the granite is of an earthy texture and\r\nblue colour, and often abounds in corals, becomes a white granular\r\nmarble near the granite, sometimes siliceous, the granular structure\r\nextending occasionally upward of 400 yards from the junction; the\r\ncorals being for the most part obliterated, though sometimes preserved,\r\neven in the white marble. Both the altered limestone and hardened slate\r\ncontain garnets in many places, also ores of iron, lead, and copper,\r\nwith some silver. These alterations occur equally whether the granite\r\ninvades the strata in a line parallel to the general strike of the\r\nfossiliferous beds, or in a line at right angles to their strike, both\r\nof which modes of junction will be seen by the ground-plan in Fig.\r\n623.[1]\r\n\r\nThe granite of Cornwall sends forth veins into a coarse\r\nargillaceous-schist, provincially termed killas. This killas is\r\nconverted into hornblende-schist near the contact with the veins. These\r\nappearances are well seen at the junction of the granite and killas, in\r\nSt. Michael’s Mount, a small island nearly 300 feet high, situated in\r\nthe bay, at a distance of about three miles from Penzance. The granite\r\nof Dartmoor, in Devonshire, says Sir H. De la Beche, has intruded\r\nitself into the Carboniferous slate and slaty sandstone, twisting and\r\ncontorting the strata, and sending veins into them. Hence some of the\r\nslate rocks have become “micaceous; others more indurated, and with the\r\ncharacters of mica-slate and gneiss; while others again appear\r\nconverted into a hard zoned rock strongly impregnated with\r\nfeldspar.”[2]\r\n\r\nWe learn from the investigation of M. Dufrenoy that in the eastern\r\nPyrenees there are mountain masses of granite posterior in date to the\r\nformations called lias and chalk of that district, and that these\r\nfossiliferous rocks are greatly altered in texture, and often charged\r\nwith iron-ore, in the neighbourhood of the granite. Thus in the\r\nenvirons of St. Martin, near St. Paul de Fenouillet, the chalky\r\nlimestone becomes more crystalline and saccharoid as it approaches the\r\ngranite, and loses all trace of the fossils which it previously\r\ncontained in abundance. At some points, also, it becomes dolomitic, and\r\nfilled with small veins of carbonate of iron, and spots of red\r\niron-ore. At Rancie the lias nearest the granite is not only filled\r\nwith iron-ore, but charged with pyrites, tremolite, garnet, and a new\r\nmineral somewhat allied to feldspar, called, from the place in the\r\nPyrenees where it occurs, “couzeranite.”\r\n\r\n“Hornblende-schist,” says Dr. MacCulloch, “may at first have been mere\r\nclay; for clay or shale is found altered by trap into Lydian stone, a\r\nsubstance differing from hornblende-schist almost solely in compactness\r\nand uniformity of texture.”[3] “In Shetland,” remarks the same author,\r\n“argillaceous-schist (or clay-slate), when in contact with granite, is\r\nsometimes converted into hornblende-schist, the schist becoming first\r\nsiliceous, and ultimately, at the contact, hornblende-schist.” In like\r\nmanner gneiss and mica-schist may be nothing more than altered\r\nmicaceous and argillaceous sandstones, granular quartz may have been\r\nderived from siliceous sandstone, and compact quartz from the same\r\nmaterials. Clay-slate may be altered shale, and granular marble may\r\nhave originated in the form of ordinary limestone, replete with shells\r\nand corals, which have since been obliterated; and, lastly, calcareous\r\nsands and marls may have been changed into impure crystalline\r\nlimestones.\r\n\r\nThe anthracite and plumbago associated with hypogene rocks may have\r\nbeen coal; for not only is coal converted into anthracite in the\r\nvicinity of some trap dikes, but we have seen that a like change has\r\ntaken place generally even far from the contact of igneous rocks, in\r\nthe disturbed region of the Appalachians. At Worcester, in the State of\r\nMassachusetts, 45 miles due west of Boston, a bed of plumbago and\r\nimpure anthracite occurs, interstratified with mica-schist. It is about\r\ntwo feet in thickness, and has been made use of both as fuel, and in\r\nthe manufacture of lead pencils. At the distance of 30 miles from the\r\nplumbago, there occurs, on the borders of Rhode Island, an impure\r\nanthracite in slates containing impressions of coal-plants of the\r\ngenera _Pecopteris, Neuropteris, Calamites,_ etc. This anthracite is\r\nintermediate in character between that of Pennsylvania and the plumbago\r\nof Worcester, in which last the gaseous or volatile matter (hydrogen,\r\noxygen, and nitrogen) is to the carbon only in the proportion of three\r\nper cent. After traversing the country in various directions, I came to\r\nthe conclusion that the carboniferous shales or slates with anthracite\r\nand plants, which in Rhode Island often pass into mica-schists, have at\r\nWorcester assumed a perfectly crystalline and metamorphic texture; the\r\nanthracite having been nearly transmuted into that state of pure carbon\r\nwhich is called plumbago or graphite.[4]\r\n\r\nNow the alterations above described as superinduced in rocks by\r\nvolcanic dikes and granite veins prove incontestably that powers exist\r\nin nature capable of transforming fossiliferous into crystalline\r\nstrata, a very few simple elements constituting the component materials\r\ncommon to both classes of rocks. These elements, which are enumerated\r\nin the table at p. 499, may be made to form new combinations by what\r\nhas been termed Plutonic action, or those chemical changes which are no\r\ndoubt connected with the passage of heat, unusually heated steam and\r\nwaters, through the strata.\r\n\r\nHydrothermal Action, or the Influence of Steam and Gases in producing\r\nMetamorphism.—The experiments of Gregory Watt, in fusing rocks in the\r\nlaboratory, and allowing them to consolidate by slow cooling, prove\r\ndistinctly that a rock need not be perfectly melted in order that a\r\nre-arrangement of its component particles should take place, and a\r\npartial crystallisation ensue.[5] We may easily suppose, therefore,\r\nthat all traces of shells and other organic remains may be destroyed,\r\nand that new chemical combinations may arise, without the mass being so\r\nfused as that the lines of stratification should be wholly obliterated.\r\nWe must not, however, imagine that heat alone, such as may be applied\r\nto a stone in the open air, can constitute all that is comprised in\r\nPlutonic action. We know that volcanoes in eruption not only emit fluid\r\nlava, but give off steam and other heated gases, which rush out in\r\nenormous volume, for days, weeks, or years continuously, and are even\r\ndisengaged from lava during its consolidation.\r\n\r\nWe also know that long after volcanoes have spent their force, hot\r\nsprings continue for ages to flow out at various points in the same\r\narea. In regions, also, subject to violent earthquakes such springs are\r\nfrequently observed issuing from rents, usually along lines of fault or\r\ndisplacement of the rocks. These thermal waters are most commonly\r\ncharged with a variety of mineral ingredients, and they retain a\r\nremarkable uniformity of temperature from century to century. A like\r\nuniformity is also persistent in the nature of the earthy, metallic,\r\nand gaseous substances with which they are impregnated. It is well\r\nascertained that springs, whether hot or cold, charged with carbonic\r\nacid, especially with hydrofluoric acid, which is often present in\r\nsmall quantities, are powerful causes of decomposition and chemical\r\nreaction in rocks through which they percolate.\r\n\r\nThe changes which Daubrée has shown to have been produced by the\r\nalkaline waters of Plombières in the Vosges, are more especially\r\ninstructive.[6] These waters have a heat of 160° F., or an excess of\r\n109° above the average temperature of ordinary springs in that\r\ndistrict. They were conveyed by the Romans to baths through long\r\nconduits or aqueducts. The foundations of some of their works consisted\r\nof a bed of concrete made of lime, fragments of brick, and sandstone.\r\nThrough this and other masonry the hot waters have been percolating for\r\ncenturies, and have given rise to various zeolites—apophyllite and\r\nchabazite among others; also to calcareous spar, arragonite, and fluor\r\nspar, together with siliceous minerals, such as opal—all found in the\r\ninter-spaces of the bricks and mortar, or constituting part of their\r\nre-arranged materials. The quantity of heat brought into action in this\r\ninstance in the course of 2000 years has, no doubt, been enormous, but\r\nthe intensity of it developed at any one moment has been always\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts and from the experiments and observations of\r\nSénarmont, Daubrée, Delesse, Scheerer, Sorby, Sterry Hunt, and others,\r\nwe are led to infer that when in the bowels of the earth there are\r\nlarge volumes of matter containing water and various acids intensely\r\nheated under enormous pressure, these subterranean fluid masses will\r\ngradually part with their heat by the escape of steam and various gases\r\nthrough fissures, producing hot springs; or by the passage of the same\r\nthrough the pores of the overlying and injected rocks. Even the most\r\ncompact rocks may be regarded, before they have been exposed to the air\r\nand dried, in the light of sponges filled with water. According to the\r\nexperiments of Henry, water, under a hydrostatic pressure of 96 feet,\r\nwill absorb three times as much carbonic acid gas as it can under the\r\nordinary pressure of the atmosphere. There are other gases, as well as\r\nthe carbonic acid, which water absorbs, and more rapidly in proportion\r\nto the amount of pressure. Although the gaseous matter first absorbed\r\nwould soon be condensed, and part with its heat, yet the continual\r\narrival of fresh supplies from below might, in the course of ages,\r\ncause the temperature of the water, and with it that of the containing\r\nrock, to be materially raised; the water acts not only as a vehicle of\r\nheat, but also by its affinity for various silicates, which, when some\r\nof the materials of the invaded rocks are decomposed, form quartz,\r\nfeldspar, mica, and other minerals. As for quartz, it can be produced\r\nunder the influence of heat by water holding alkaline silicates in\r\nsolution, as in the case of the Plombières springs. The quantity of\r\nwater required, according to Daubrée, to produce great transformations\r\nin the mineral structure of rocks, is very small. As to the heat\r\nrequired, silicates may be produced in the moist way at about incipient\r\nred heat, whereas to form the same in the dry way would require a much\r\nhigher temperature.\r\n\r\nM. Fournet, in his description of the metalliferous gneiss near\r\nClermont, in Auvergne, states that all the minute fissures of the rock\r\nare quite saturated with free carbonic acid gas; which gas rises\r\nplentifully from the soil there and in many parts of the surrounding\r\ncountry. The various elements of the gneiss, with the exception of the\r\nquartz, are all softened; and new combinations of the acid with lime,\r\niron, and manganese are continually in progress.[7]\r\n\r\nThe power of subterranean gases is well illustrated by the stufas of\r\nSt. Calogero in the Lipari Islands, where the horizontal strata of\r\ntuffs, forming cliffs 200 feet high, have been discoloured in places by\r\nthe jets of steam often above the boiling point, called “stufas,”\r\nissuing from the fissures; and similar instances are recorded by M.\r\nVirlet of corrosion of rocks near Corinth, and by Dr. Daubeny of\r\ndecomposition of trachytic rocks by sulphureted hydrogen and muriatic\r\nacid gases in the Solfatara, near Naples. In all these instances it is\r\nclear that the gaseous fluids must have made their way through vast\r\nthicknesses of porous or fissured rocks, and their modifying influence\r\nmay spread through the crust for thousands of yards in thickness.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged as an argument against the metamorphic theory, that\r\nrocks have a small power of conducting heat, and it is true that when\r\ndry, and in the air, they differ remarkably from metals in this\r\nrespect. The syenite of Norway, as we have seen (p. 558), has sometimes\r\naltered fossiliferous strata both in the direction of their dip and\r\nstrike for a distance of a quarter of a mile, but the theory of gneiss\r\nand mica-schist above proposed requires us to imagine that the same\r\ninfluence has extended through strata miles in thickness. Professor\r\nBischof has shown what changes may be superinduced, on black marble and\r\nother rocks, by the steam of a hot spring having a temperature of no\r\nmore than 133° to 167° Fahrenheit, and we are becoming more and more\r\nacquainted with the prominent part which water is playing in\r\ndistributing the heat of the interior through mountain masses of\r\nincumbent strata, and of introducing into them various mineral elements\r\nin a fluid or gaseous state. Such facts may induce us to consider\r\nwhether many granites and other rocks of that class may not sometimes\r\nrepresent merely the extreme of a similar slow metamorphism. But, on\r\nthe other hand, the heat of lava in a volcanic crater when it is white\r\nand glowing like the sun must convince us that the temperature of a\r\ncolumn of such a fluid at the depth of many miles exceeds any heat\r\nwhich can ever be witnessed at the surface. That large portions of the\r\nPlutonic rocks had been formed under the influence of such intense heat\r\nis in perfect accordance with their great volume, uniform composition,\r\nand absence of stratification. The forcing also of veins into\r\ncontiguous stratified or schistose rocks is a natural consequence of\r\nthe hydrostatic pressure to which columns of molten matter many miles\r\nin height must give rise.\r\n\r\nObjections to the Metamorphic Theory considered.—It has been objected\r\nto the metamorphic theory that the crystalline schists contain a\r\nconsiderable proportion of potash and soda, whilst the sedimentary\r\nstrata out of which they are supposed to have been formed are usually\r\nwanting in alkaline matter. But this reasoning proceeds on mistaken\r\ndata, for clay, marl, shale, and slate often contain a considerable\r\nproportion of alkali, so much so as to make them frequently unfit to be\r\nburnt into bricks or pottery, and the Old Red Sandstone in Forfarshire\r\nand other parts of Scotland, derived from disintegration of granite,\r\ncontains much triturated feldspar rich in potash. In the common salt by\r\nwhich strata are often largely impregnated, as in Patagonia, much soda\r\nis present, and potash enters largely into the composition of fossil\r\nsea-weeds, and recent analysis has also shown that the carboniferous\r\nstrata in England, the Upper and Lower Silurian in East Canada, and the\r\noldest clay-slates in Norway, all contain as much alkali as is\r\ngenerally present in metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nAnother objection has been derived from the alternation of highly\r\ncrystalline strata with others less crystalline. The heat, it is said,\r\nin its ascent from below, must have traversed the less altered schists\r\nbefore it reached a higher and more crystalline bed. In answer to this,\r\nit may be observed, that if a number of strata differing greatly in\r\ncomposition from each other be subjected to equal quantities of heat,\r\nor hydrothermal action, there is every probability that some will be\r\nmuch more fusible or soluble than others. Some, for example, will\r\ncontain soda, potash, lime, or some other ingredient capable of acting\r\nas a flux or solvent; while others may be destitute of the same\r\nelements, and so refractory as to be very slightly affected by the same\r\ncauses. Nor should it be forgotten that, as a general rule, the less\r\ncrystalline rocks do really occur in the upper, and the more\r\ncrystalline in the lower part of each metamorphic series.\r\n\r\n [1] Keilhau, Gæa Norvegica, pp. 61-63.\r\n\r\n [2] Geol.

There are\r\nfour distinct forms of structure exhibited in rocks, namely,\r\nstratification, joints, slaty cleavage, and foliation; and all these\r\nmust have different names, even though there be cases where it is\r\nimpossible, after carefully studying the appearances, to decide upon\r\nthe class to which they belong.\r\n\r\nSlaty Cleavage.—Professor Sedgwick, whose essay “On the Structure of\r\nlarge Mineral Masses” first cleared the way towards a better\r\nunderstanding of this difficult subject, observes, that joints are\r\ndistinguishable from lines of slaty cleavage in this, that the rock\r\nintervening between two joints has no tendency to cleave in a direction\r\nparallel to the planes of the joints, whereas a rock is capable of\r\nindefinite subdivision in the direction of its slaty cleavage. In cases\r\nwhere the strata are curved, the planes of cleavage are still perfectly\r\nparallel. This has been observed in the slate rocks of part of Wales\r\n(see Fig. 624), which consists of a hard greenish slate. The true\r\nbedding is there indicated by a number of parallel stripes, some of a\r\nlighter and some of a darker colour than the general mass. Such stripes\r\nare found to be parallel to the true planes of stratification, wherever\r\nthese are manifested by ripple-mark or by beds containing peculiar\r\norganic remains. Some of the contorted strata are of a coarse\r\nmechanical structure, alternating with fine-grained crystalline\r\nchloritic slates, in which case the same slaty cleavage extends through\r\nthe coarser and finer beds, though it is brought out in greater\r\nperfection in proportion as the materials of the rock are fine and\r\nhomogeneous. It is only when these are very coarse that the cleavage\r\nplanes entirely vanish. In the Welsh hills these planes are usually\r\ninclined at a very considerable angle to the planes of the strata, the\r\naverage angle being as much as from 30° to 40°. Sometimes the cleavage\r\nplanes dip towards the same point of the compass as those of\r\nstratification, but often to opposite points.[1] The cleavage, as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 624, is generally constant over the whole of any\r\narea affected by one great set of disturbances, as if the same lateral\r\npressure which caused the crumpling up of the rock along parallel,\r\nanticlinal, and synclinal axes caused also the cleavage.\r\n\r\nFig. 624: Parallel planes of cleavage intersecting curved strata.\r\n\r\nFig. 625: Section in Lower Silurian slates of Cardiganshire, showing\r\nthe cleavage planes bent along the junction of the beds.\r\nMr. T. McK. Hughes remarks, that where a rough cleavage cuts\r\nflag-stones at a considerable angle to the planes of stratification,\r\nthe rock often splits into large slabs, across which the lines of\r\nbedding are frequently seen, but when the cleavage planes approach\r\nwithin about 15° of stratification, the rock is apt to split along the\r\nlines of bedding. He has also called my attention to the fact that\r\nsubsequent movements in a cleaved rock sometimes drag and bend the\r\ncleavage planes along the junction of the beds in the manner indicated\r\nin Fig. 625.\r\n\r\nJointed Structure.—In regard to joints, they are natural fissures which\r\noften traverse rocks in straight and well-determined lines. They afford\r\nto the quarryman, as Sir R. Murchison observes, when speaking of the\r\nphenomenon, as exhibited in Shropshire and the neighbouring counties,\r\nthe greatest aid in the extraction of blocks of stone; and, if a\r\nsufficient number cross each other, the whole mass of rock is split\r\ninto symmetrical blocks. The faces of the joints are for the most part\r\nsmoother and more regular than the surfaces of true strata. The joints\r\nare straight-cut chinks, sometimes slightly open, and often passing,\r\nnot only through layers of successive deposition, but also through\r\nballs of limestone or other matter which have been formed by\r\nconcretionary action since the original accumulation of the strata.\r\nSuch joints, therefore, must often have resulted from one of the last\r\nchanges superinduced upon sedimentary deposits.[2]\r\n\r\nFig. 626: Stratification, joints, and cleavage.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 626 the flat-surfaces of rock, A, B, C, represent exposed faces\r\nof joints, to which the walls of other joints, J J, are parallel. S S\r\nare the lines of stratification; D D are lines of slaty cleavage, which\r\nintersect the rock at a considerable angle to the planes of\r\nstratification.\r\n\r\nIn the Swiss and Savoy Alps, as Mr. Bakewell has remarked, enormous\r\nmasses of limestone are cut through so regularly by nearly vertical\r\npartings, and these joints are often so much more conspicuous than the\r\nseams of stratification, that an inexperienced observer will almost\r\ninevitably confound them, and suppose the strata to be perpendicular in\r\nplaces where in fact they are almost horizontal.[3]\r\n\r\nNow such joints are supposed to be analogous to the partings which\r\nseparate volcanic and Plutonic rocks into cuboidal and prismatic\r\nmasses. On a small scale we see clay and starch when dry split into\r\nsimilar shapes; this is often caused by simple contraction, whether the\r\nshrinking be due to the evaporation of water, or to a change of\r\ntemperature. It is well known that many sandstones and other rocks\r\nexpand by the application of moderate degrees of heat, and then\r\ncontract again on cooling; and there can be no doubt that large\r\nportions of the earth’s crust have, in the course of past ages, been\r\nsubjected again and again to very different degrees of heat and cold.\r\nThese alternations of temperature have probably contributed largely to\r\nthe production of joints in rocks.\r\n\r\nIn many countries where masses of basalt rest on sandstone, the aqueous\r\nrock has, for the distance of several feet from the point of junction,\r\nassumed a columnar structure similar to that of the trap. In like\r\nmanner some hearth-stones, after exposure to the heat of a furnace\r\nwithout being melted, have become prismatic. Certain crystals also\r\nacquire by the application of heat a new internal arrangement, so as to\r\nbreak in a new direction, their external form remaining unaltered.\r\n\r\nCrystalline Theory of Cleavage.—Professor Sedgwick, speaking of the\r\nplanes of slaty cleavage, where they are decidedly distinct from those\r\nof sedimentary deposition, declared, in the essay before alluded to,\r\nhis opinion that no retreat of parts, no contraction in the dimensions\r\nof rocks in passing to a solid state, can account for the phenomenon.\r\nHe accordingly referred it to crystalline or polar forces acting\r\nsimultaneously, and somewhat uniformly, in given directions, on large\r\nmasses having a homogeneous composition.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, in allusion to slaty cleavage, has suggested that\r\n“if rocks have been so heated as to allow a commencement of\r\ncrystallisation—that is to say, if they have been heated to a point at\r\nwhich the particles can begin to move among themselves, or at least on\r\ntheir own axes, some general law must then determine the position in\r\nwhich these particles will rest on cooling. Probably, that position\r\nwill have some relation to the direction in which the heat escapes.\r\nNow, when all, or a majority of particles of the same nature have a\r\ngeneral tendency to one position, that must of course determine a\r\ncleavage-plane. Thus we see the infinitesimal crystals of\r\nfresh-precipitated sulphate of barytes, and some other such bodies,\r\narrange themselves alike in the fluid in which they float; so as, when\r\nstirred, all to glance with one light, and give the appearance of silky\r\nfilaments. Some sorts of soap, in which insoluble margarates[4] exist,\r\nexhibit the same phenomenon when mixed with water; and what occurs in\r\nour experiments on a minute scale may occur in nature on a great\r\none.”[5]\r\n\r\nMechanical Theory of Cleavage.—Professor Phillips has remarked that in\r\nsome slaty rocks the form of the outline of fossil shells and\r\ntrilobites has been much changed by distortion, which has taken place\r\nin a longitudinal, transverse, or oblique direction. This change, he\r\nadds, seems to be the result of a “creeping movement” of the particles\r\nof the rock along the planes of cleavage, its direction being always\r\nuniform over the same tract of country, and its amount in space being\r\nsometimes measurable, and being as much as a quarter or even half an\r\ninch. The hard shells are not affected, but only those which are\r\nthin.[6] Mr. D. Sharpe, following up the same line of inquiry, came to\r\nthe conclusion that the present distorted forms of the shells in\r\ncertain British slate rocks may be accounted for by supposing that the\r\nrocks in which they are imbedded have undergone compression in a\r\ndirection perpendicular to the planes of cleavage, and a corresponding\r\nexpansion in the direction of the dip of the cleavage.[7]\r\n\r\nSubsequently (1853) Mr. Sorby demonstrated the great extent to which\r\nthis mechanical theory is applicable to the slate rocks of North Wales\r\nand Devonshire,[8] districts where the amount of change in dimensions\r\ncan be tested and measured by comparing the different effects exerted\r\nby lateral pressure on alternating beds of finer and coarser materials.\r\nThus, for example, in Fig. 627 it will be seen that the sandy bed _d\r\nf,_ which has offered greater resistance, has been sharply contorted,\r\nwhile the fine-grained strata, _a, b, c,_ have remained comparatively\r\nunbent. The points _d_ and _f_ in the stratum _d f_ must have been\r\noriginally four times as far apart as they are now. They have been\r\nforced so much nearer to each other, partly by bending, and partly by\r\nbecoming elongated in the direction of what may be called the longer\r\naxes of their contortions, and lastly, to a certain small amount, by\r\ncondensation. The chief result has obviously been due to the bending;\r\nbut, in proof of elongation, it will be observed that the thickness of\r\nthe bed _d f_ is now about four times greater in those parts lying in\r\nthe main direction of the flexures than in a plane perpendicular to\r\nthem; and the same bed exhibits cleavage planes in the direction of the\r\ngreatest movement, although they are much fewer than in the slaty\r\nstrata above and below.\r\n\r\nFig. 627: Vertical section of slate rock in the cliffs near Ilfracombe,\r\nNorth Devon.\r\nAbove the sandy bed _d f,_ the stratum _c_ is somewhat disturbed, while\r\nthe next bed, _b,_ is much less so, and a not at all; yet all these\r\nbeds, _c, b,_ and _a,_ must have undergone an equal amount of pressure\r\nwith _d,_ the points a and g having approximated as much towards each\r\nother as have _ d_ and _f._ The same phenomena are also repeated in the\r\nbeds below _d,_ and might have been shown, had the section been\r\nextended downward. Hence it appears that the finer beds have been\r\nsqueezed into a fourth of the space they previously occupied, partly by\r\ncondensation, or the closer packing of their ultimate particles (which\r\nhas given rise to the great specific gravity of such slates), and\r\npartly by elongation in the line of the dip of the cleavage, of which\r\nthe general direction is perpendicular to that of the pressure. “These\r\nand numerous other cases in North Devon are analogous,” says Mr. Sorby,\r\n“to what would occur if a strip of paper were included in a mass of\r\nsome soft plastic material which would readily change its dimensions.\r\nIf the whole were then compressed in the direction of the length of the\r\nstrip of paper, it would be bent and puckered up into contortions,\r\nwhile the plastic material would readily change its dimensions without\r\nundergoing such contortions; and the difference in distance of the ends\r\nof the paper, as measured in a direct line or along it, would indicate\r\nthe change in the dimensions of the plastic material.”\r\n\r\nBy microscopic examination of minute crystals, and by other\r\nobservations, Mr. Sorby has come to the conclusion that the absolute\r\ncondensation of the slate rocks amounts upon an average to about one\r\nhalf their original volume. Most of the scales of mica occurring in\r\ncertain slates examined by Mr. Sorby lie in the plane of cleavage;\r\nwhereas in a similar rock not exhibiting cleavage they lie with their\r\nlonger axes in all directions. May not their position in the slates\r\nhave been determined by the movement of elongation before alluded to?\r\nTo illustrate this theory some scales of oxide of iron were mixed with\r\nsoft pipe-clay in such a manner that they inclined in all directions.\r\nThe dimensions of the mass were then changed artificially to a similar\r\nextent to what has occurred in slate rocks, and the pipe-clay was then\r\ndried and baked. When it was afterwards rubbed to a flat surface\r\nperpendicular to the pressure and in the line of elongation, or in a\r\nplane corresponding to that of the dip of cleavage, the particles were\r\nfound to have become arranged in the same manner as in natural slates,\r\nand the mass admitted of easy fracture into thin flat pieces in the\r\nplane alluded to, whereas it would not yield in that perpendicular to\r\nthe cleavage.[9]\r\n\r\nDr. Tyndall, when commenting in 1856 on Mr. Sorby’s experiments,\r\nobserved that pressure alone is sufficient to produce cleavage, and\r\nthat the intervention of plates of mica or scales of oxide of iron, or\r\nany other substances having flat surfaces, is quite unnecessary. In\r\nproof of this he showed experimentally that a mass of “pure white wax,\r\nafter having been submitted to great pressure, exhibited a cleavage\r\nmore clean than that of any slate-rock, splitting into laminæ of\r\nsurpassing tenuity.”[10] He remarks that every mass of clay or mud is\r\ndivided and subdivided by surfaces among which the cohesion is\r\ncomparatively small. On being subjected to pressure, such masses yield\r\nand spread out in the direction of least resistance, small nodules\r\nbecome converted into laminæ separated from each other by surfaces of\r\nweak cohesion, and the result is that the mass cleaves at right angles\r\nto the line in which the pressure is exerted. In further illustration\r\nof this, Mr. Hughes remarks that “concretions which in the undisturbed\r\nbeds have their longer axes parallel to the bedding are, where the rock\r\nis much cleaved, frequently found flattened laterally, so as to have\r\ntheir longer axes parallel to the cleavage planes, and at a\r\nconsiderable angle, even right angles, to their former position.”\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin attributes the lamination and fissile structure of volcanic\r\nrocks of the trachytic series, including some obsidians in Ascension,\r\nMexico, and elsewhere, to their having moved when liquid in the\r\ndirection of the laminæ. The zones consist sometimes of layers of\r\nair-cells drawn out and lengthened in the supposed direction of the\r\nmoving mass.[11]\r\n\r\nFoliation of Crystalline Schists.—After studying, in 1835, the\r\ncrystalline rocks of South America, Mr. Darwin proposed the term\r\n_foliation_ for the laminæ or plates into which gneiss, mica-schist,\r\nand other crystalline rocks are divided. Cleavage, he observes, may be\r\napplied to those divisional planes which render a rock fissile,\r\nalthough it may appear to the eye quite or nearly homogeneous.\r\nFoliation may be used for those alternating layers or plates of\r\ndifferent mineralogical nature of which gneiss and other metamorphic\r\nschists are composed.\r\n\r\nThat the planes of foliation of the crystalline schists in Norway\r\naccord very generally with those of original stratification is a\r\nconclusion long since espoused by Keilhau.[12] Numerous observations\r\nmade by Mr. David Forbes in the same country (the best probably in\r\nEurope for studying such phenomena on a grand scale) confirm Keilhau’s\r\nopinion. In Scotland, also, Mr. D. Forbes has pointed out a striking\r\ncase where the foliation is identical with the lines of stratification\r\nin rocks well seen near Crianlorich on the road to Tyndrum, about eight\r\nmiles from Inverarnon, in Perthshire. There is in that locality a blue\r\nlimestone foliated by the intercalation of small plates of white mica,\r\nso that the rock is often scarcely distinguishable in aspect from\r\ngneiss or mica-schist. The stratification is shown by the large beds\r\nand coloured bands of limestone all dipping, like the folia, at an\r\nangle of 32° N.E.[13] In stratified formations of every age we see\r\nlayers of siliceous sand with or without mica, alternating with clay,\r\nwith fragments of shells or corals, or with seams of vegetable matter,\r\nand we should expect the mutual attraction of like particles to favour\r\nthe crystallisation of the quartz, or mica, or feldspar, or carbonate\r\nof lime, along the planes of original deposition, rather than in planes\r\nplaced at angles of 20 or 40 degrees to those of stratification.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how much the original planes of stratification may be\r\ninterfered with or even obliterated by concretionary action in deposits\r\nstill retaining their fossils, as in the case of the magnesian\r\nlimestone (see p. 63). Hence we must expect to be frequently baffled\r\nwhen we attempt to decide whether the foliation does or does not accord\r\nwith that arrangement which gravitation, combined with current-action,\r\nimparted to a deposit from water. Moreover, when we look for\r\nstratification in crystalline rocks, we must be on our guard not to\r\nexpect too much regularity. The occurrence of wedge-shaped masses, such\r\nas belong to coarse sand and pebbles—diagonal lamination (p.\r\n42)—ripple-marked, unconformable stratification,—the fantastic folds\r\nproduced by lateral pressure—faults of various width—intrusive dikes of\r\ntrap—organic bodies of diversified shapes, and other causes of\r\nunevenness in the planes of deposition, both on the small and on the\r\nlarge scale, will interfere with parallelism. If complex and\r\nenigmatical appearances did not present themselves, it would be a\r\nserious objection to the metamorphic theory. Mr. Sorby has shown that\r\nthe peculiar structure belonging to ripple-marked sands, or that which\r\nis generated when ripples are formed during the deposition of the\r\nmaterials, is distinctly recognisable in many varieties of mica-schists\r\nin Scotland.[14]\r\n\r\nFig. 628: Lamination of clay-stone. Montagne de Seguinat, near\r\nGavarnie, in the Pyrenees.\r\nIn Fig. 628 I have represented carefully the lamination of a coarse\r\nargillaceous schist which I examined in 1830 in the Pyrenees. In part\r\nit approaches in character to a green and blue roofing-slate, while\r\npart is extremely quartzose, the whole mass passing downward into\r\nmicaceous schist. The vertical section here exhibited is about three\r\nfeet in height, and the layers are sometimes so thin that fifty may be\r\ncounted in the thickness of an inch. Some of them consist of pure\r\nquartz. There is a resemblance in such cases to the diagonal lamination\r\nwhich we see in sedimentary rocks, even though the layers of quartz and\r\nof mica, or of feldspar and other minerals, may be more distinct in\r\nalternating folia than they were originally.\r\n\r\n [1] Geol.

We can rarely hope to define with exactness the date of\r\nboth these periods, the fossils having been destroyed by Plutonic\r\naction, and the mineral characters being the same, whatever the age.\r\nSuperposition itself is an ambiguous test, especially when we desire to\r\ndetermine the period of crystallisation. Suppose, for example, we are\r\nconvinced that certain metamorphic strata in the Alps, which are\r\ncovered by cretaceous beds, are altered lias; this lias may have\r\nassumed its crystalline texture in the cretaceous or in some tertiary\r\nperiod, the Eocene for example.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing the ages of the Plutonic rocks, we have seen that\r\nexamples occur of various primary, secondary, and tertiary deposits\r\nconverted into metamorphic strata near their contact with granite.\r\nThere can be no doubt in these cases that strata once composed of mud,\r\nsand, and gravel, or of clay, marl, and shelly limestone, have for the\r\ndistance of several yards, and in some instances several hundred feet,\r\nbeen turned into gneiss, mica-schist, hornblende-schist,\r\nchlorite-schist, quartz rock, statuary marble, and the rest. (See the\r\ntwo preceding chapters.) It may be easy to prove the identity of two\r\ndifferent parts of the same stratum; one, where the rock has been in\r\ncontact with a volcanic or Plutonic mass, and has been changed into\r\nmarble or hornblende-schist, and another not far distant, where the\r\nsame bed remains unaltered and fossiliferous; but when hydrothermal\r\naction, as described in Chapter XXXIII, has operated gradually on a\r\nmore extensive scale, it may have finally destroyed all monuments of\r\nthe date of its development throughout a whole mountain chain, and all\r\nthe labour and skill of the most practised observers are required, and\r\nmay sometimes be at fault. I shall mention one or two examples of\r\nalteration on a grand scale, in order to explain to the student the\r\nkind of reasoning by which we are led to infer that dense masses of\r\nfossiliferous strata have been converted into crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nEocene Strata rendered metamorphic in the Alps.—In the eastern part of\r\nthe Alps, some of the Palæozoic strata, as well as the older Mesozoic\r\nformations, including the oolitic and cretaceous rocks, are distinctly\r\nrecognisable. Tertiary deposits also appear in a less elevated position\r\non the flanks of the Eastern Alps; but in the Central or Swiss Alps,\r\nthe Palæozoic and older Mesozoic formations disappear, and the\r\nCretaceous, Oolitic, Liassic, and at some points even the Eocene\r\nstrata, graduate insensibly into metamorphic rocks, consisting of\r\ngranular limestone, talc-schist, talcose-gneiss, micaceous schist, and\r\nother varieties.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the partial conversion into gneiss of portions of\r\na highly inclined set of beds, I may cite Sir R. Murchison’s memoir on\r\nthe structure of the Alps. Slates provincially termed “flysch” (see p.\r\n278), overlying the nummulite limestone of Eocene date, and comprising\r\nsome arenaceous and some calcareous layers, are seen to alternate\r\nseveral times with bands of granitoid rock, answering in character to\r\ngneiss. In this case heat, vapour, or water at a high temperature may\r\nhave traversed the more permeable beds, and altered them so far as to\r\nadmit of an internal movement and re-arrangement of the molecules,\r\nwhile the adjoining strata did not give passage to the same heated\r\ngases or water, or, if so, remained unchanged because they were\r\ncomposed of less fusible or decomposable materials. Whatever hypothesis\r\nwe adopt, the phenomena establish beyond a doubt the possibility of the\r\ndevelopment of the metamorphic structure in a tertiary deposit in\r\nplanes parallel to those of stratification. The strata appear clearly\r\nto have been affected, though in a less intense degree, by that same\r\nPlutonic action which has entirely altered and rendered metamorphic so\r\nmany of the subjacent formations; for in the Alps this action has by no\r\nmeans been confined to the immediate vicinity of granite. Granite,\r\nindeed, and other Plutonic rocks, rarely make their appearance at the\r\nsurface, notwithstanding the deep ravines which lay open to view the\r\ninternal structure of these mountains. That they exist below at no\r\ngreat depth we cannot doubt, for at some points, as in the Valorsine,\r\nnear Mont Blanc, granite and granitic veins are observable, piercing\r\nthrough talcose gneiss, which passes insensibly upward into secondary\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly in the Alps of Switzerland and Savoy, more than in any\r\nother district in Europe, that the geologist is prepared to meet with\r\nthe signs of an intense development of Plutonic action; for here strata\r\nthousands of feet thick have been bent, folded, and overturned, and\r\nmarine secondary formations of a comparatively modern date, such as the\r\nOolitic and Cretaceous, have been upheaved to the height of 12,000, and\r\nsome Eocene strata to elevations of 10,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea; and even deposits of the Miocene era have been raised 4000 or 5000\r\nfeet, so as to rival in height the loftiest mountains in Great Britain.\r\nIn one of the sections described by M. Studer in the highest of the\r\nBernese Alps, namely in the Roththal, a valley bordering the line of\r\nperpetual snow on the northern side of the Jungfrau, there occurs a\r\nmass of gneiss 1000 feet thick, and 15,000 feet long, which I examined,\r\nnot only resting upon, but also again covered by strata containing\r\noolitic fossils. These anomalous appearances may partly be explained by\r\nsupposing great solid wedges of intrusive gneiss to have been forced in\r\nlaterally between strata to which I found them to be in many sections\r\nunconformable. The superposition, also, of the gneiss to the oolite\r\nmay, in some cases, be due to a reversal of the original position of\r\nthe beds in a region where the convulsions have been on so stupendous a\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nNorthern Apennines.—Carrara.—The celebrated marble of Carrara, used in\r\nsculpture, was once regarded as a type of primitive limestone. It\r\nabounds in the mountains of Massa Carrara, or the “Apuan Alps,” as they\r\nhave been called, the highest peaks of which are nearly 6000 feet high.\r\nIts great antiquity was inferred from its mineral texture, from the\r\nabsence of fossils, and its passage downward into talc-schist and\r\ngarnetiferous mica-schist; these rocks again graduating downward into\r\ngneiss, which is penetrated, at Forno, by granite veins. But the\r\nresearches of MM. Savi, Boué, Pareto, Guidoni, De la Beche, Hoffman,\r\nand Pilla demonstrated that this marble, once supposed to be formed\r\nbefore the existence of organic beings, is, in fact, an altered\r\nlimestone of the Oolitic period, and the underlying crystalline schists\r\nare secondary sandstones and shales, modified by Plutonic action. In\r\norder to establish these conclusions it was first pointed out that the\r\ncalcareous rocks bordering the Gulf of Spezia, and abounding in Oolitic\r\nfossils, assume a texture like that of Carrara marble, in proportion as\r\nthey are more and more invaded by certain trappean and Plutonic rocks,\r\nsuch as diorite, serpentine, and granite, occurring in the same\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was then observed that, in places where the secondary formations are\r\nunaltered, the uppermost consist of common Apennine limestone with\r\nnodules of flint, below which are shales, and at the base of all,\r\nargillaceous and siliceous sandstones. In the limestone fossils are\r\nfrequent, but very rare in the underlying shale and sandstone. Then a\r\ngradation was traced laterally from these rocks into another and\r\ncorresponding series, which is completely metamorphic; for at the top\r\nof this we find a white granular marble, wholly devoid of fossils, and\r\nalmost without stratification, in which there are no nodules of flint,\r\nbut in its place siliceous matter disseminated through the mass in the\r\nform of prisms of quartz. Below this, and in place of the shales, are\r\ntalc-schists, jasper, and hornstone; and at the bottom, instead of the\r\nsiliceous and argillaceous sandstones, are quartzite and gneiss.[1] Had\r\nthese secondary strata of the Apennines undergone universally as great\r\nan amount of transmutation, it would have been impossible to form a\r\nconjecture respecting their true age; and then, according to the method\r\nof classification adopted by the earlier geologists, they would have\r\nranked as primary rocks. In that case the date of their origin would\r\nhave been thrown back to an era antecedent to the deposition of the\r\nLower Silurian or Cambrian strata, although in reality they were formed\r\nin the Oolitic period, and altered at some subsequent and perhaps much\r\nlater epoch.\r\n\r\nMetamorphic Strata of older date than the Silurian and Cambrian\r\nRocks.—It was remarked (Fig. 617) that as the hypogene rocks, both\r\nstratified and unstratified, crystallise originally at a certain depth\r\nbeneath the surface, they must always, before they are upraised and\r\nexposed at the surface, be of considerable antiquity, relatively to a\r\nlarge portion of the fossiliferous and volcanic rocks. They may be\r\nforming at all periods; but before any of them can become visible, they\r\nmust be raised above the level of the sea, and some of the rocks which\r\npreviously concealed them must have been removed by denudation.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, as we have seen (p. 491), the Lower Laurentian gneiss,\r\nquartzite, and limestone may be regarded as metamorphic, because, among\r\nother reasons, organic remains (_Eozoon Canadense_) have been detected\r\nin a part of one of the calcareous masses. The Upper Laurentian or\r\nLabrador series lies unconformably upon the Lower, and differs from it\r\nchiefly in having as yet yielded no fossils. It consists of gneiss with\r\nLabrador-feldspar and feldstones, in all 10,000 feet thick, and both\r\nits composition and structure lead us to suppose that, like the Lower\r\nLaurentian, it was originally of sedimentary origin and owes its\r\ncrystalline condition to metamorphic action. The remote date of the\r\nperiod when some of these old Laurentian strata of Canada were\r\nconverted into gneiss may be inferred from the fact that pebbles of\r\nthat rock are found in the overlying Huronian formation, which is\r\nprobably of Cambrian age (p. 490).\r\n\r\nThe oldest stratified rock of Scotland is the hornblendic gneiss of\r\nLewis, in the Hebrides, and that of the north-west coast of Ross-shire,\r\nrepresented at the base of the section given at Fig. 82. It is the same\r\nas that intersected by numerous granite veins which forms the cliffs of\r\nCape Wrath, in Sutherlandshire (see Fig. 613), and is conjectured to be\r\nof Laurentian age. Above it, as shown in the section (Fig. 82), lie\r\nunconformable beds of a reddish or purple sandstone and conglomerate,\r\nnearly horizontal, and between 3000 and 4000 feet thick. In these\r\nancient grits no fossils have been found, but they are supposed to be\r\nof Cambrian date, for Sir R. Murchison found Lower Silurian strata\r\nresting unconformably upon them. These strata consist of quartzite with\r\nannelid burrows already alluded to (p. 112), and limestone in which Mr.\r\nCharles Peach was the first to find, in 1854, three or four species of\r\n_Orthoceras,_ also the genera _Cyrtoceras_ and _ Lituites,_ two species\r\nof _Murchisonia,_ a _ Pleurotomaria,_ a species of _Maclurea,_ one of _\r\nEuomphalus,_ and an _Orthis._ Several of the species are believed by\r\nMr. Salter to be identical with Lower Silurian fossils of Canada and\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the true age of these fossiliferous rocks was one of\r\nthe most important steps made of late years in the progress of British\r\nGeology, for it led to the unexpected conclusion that all the Scotch\r\ncrystalline strata to the eastward, once called primitive, which\r\noverlie the limestone and quartzite in question, are referable to some\r\npart of the Silurian series.\r\n\r\nThese Scotch metamorphic strata are of gneiss, mica-schist, and\r\nclay-slate of vast thickness, and having a strike from north-east to\r\nsouth-west almost at right angles to that of the older Laurentian\r\ngneiss before mentioned. The newer crystalline series, comprising the\r\ncrystalline rocks of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, and Forfarshire, were\r\ninferred by Sir R. Murchison to be altered Silurian strata; and his\r\nopinion has been since confirmed by the observations of three able\r\ngeologists, Messrs. Ramsay, Harkness, and Geikie. The newest of the\r\nseries is a clay-slate, on which, along the southern borders of the\r\nGrampians, the Lower Old Red, containing _Cephalaspis Lyelli,\r\nPterygotus Anglicus,_ and _Parka decipiens,_ rests unconformably.\r\n\r\nOrder of Succession in Metamorphic Rocks.—There is no universal and\r\ninvariable order of superposition in metamorphic rocks, although a\r\nparticular arrangement may prevail throughout countries of great\r\nextent, for the same reason that it is traceable in those sedimentary\r\nformations from which crystalline strata are derived. Thus, for\r\nexample, we have seen that in the Apennines, near Carrara, the\r\ndescending series, where it is metamorphic, consists of, first,\r\nsaccharine marble; second, talcose-schist; and third, of quartz-rock\r\nand gneiss: where unaltered, of, first, fossiliferous limestone;\r\nsecond, shale; and third, sandstone.\r\n\r\nBut if we investigate different mountain chains, we find gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, hornblende-schist, chlorite-schist, hypogene limestone,\r\nand other rocks, succeeding each other, and alternating with each other\r\nin every possible order. It is, indeed, more common to meet with some\r\nvariety of clay-slate forming the uppermost member of a metamorphic\r\nseries than any other rock; but this fact by no means implies, as some\r\nhave imagined, that all clay-slates were formed at the close of an\r\nimaginary period when the deposition of the crystalline strata gave way\r\nto that of ordinary sedimentary deposits. Such clay-slates, in fact,\r\nare variable in composition, and sometimes alternate with fossiliferous\r\nstrata, so that they may be said to belong almost equally to the\r\nsedimentary and metamorphic order of rocks. It is probable that, had\r\nthey been subjected to more intense Plutonic action, they would have\r\nbeen transformed into hornblende-schist, foliated chlorite-schist,\r\nscaly talcose-schist, mica-schist, or other more perfectly crystalline\r\nrocks, such as are usually associated with gneiss.\r\n\r\n_Uniformity of Mineral Character in Hypogene Rocks._—It is true, as\r\nHumboldt has happily remarked, that when we pass to another hemisphere,\r\nwe see new forms of animals and plants, and even new constellations in\r\nthe heavens; but in the rocks we still recognise our old\r\nacquaintances—the same granite, the same gneiss, the same micaceous\r\nschist, quartz-rock, and the rest. There is certainly a great and\r\nstriking general resemblance in the principal kinds of hypogene rocks\r\nin all countries, however different their ages; but each of them, as we\r\nhave seen, must be regarded as geological families of rocks, and not as\r\ndefinite mineral compounds. They are more uniform in aspect than\r\nsedimentary strata, because these last are often composed of fragments\r\nvarying greatly in form, size, and colour, and contain fossils of\r\ndifferent shapes and mineral composition, and acquire a variety of\r\ntints from the mixture of various kinds of sediment. The materials of\r\nsuch strata, if they underwent metamorphism, would be subject to\r\nchemical laws, simple and uniform in their action, the same in every\r\nclimate, and wholly undisturbed by mechanical and organic causes. It\r\nwould, however, be a great error to assume, as some have done, that the\r\nhypogene rocks, considered as aggregates of simple minerals, are really\r\nmore homogeneous in their composition than the several members of the\r\nsedimentary series. Not only do the proportional quantities of\r\nfeldspar, quartz, mica, hornblende, and other minerals, vary in\r\nhypogene rocks bearing the same name; but what is still more important,\r\nthe ingredients, as we have seen, of the same simple mineral are not\r\nalways constant (see p. 503 and table, p. 499).\r\n\r\nSupposed Azoic Period.—The total absence of any trace of fossils has\r\ninclined many geologists to attribute the origin of the most ancient\r\nstrata to an azoic period, or one antecedent to the existence of\r\norganic beings. Admitting, they say, the obliteration, in some cases,\r\nof fossils by Plutonic action, we might still expect that traces of\r\nthem would oftener be found in certain ancient systems of slate which\r\ncan scarcely be said to have assumed a crystalline structure. But in\r\nurging this argument it seems to have been forgotten that there are\r\nstratified formations of enormous thickness, and of various ages, some\r\nof them even of Tertiary date, and which we know were formed after the\r\nearth had become the abode of living creatures, which are,\r\nnevertheless, in some districts, entirely destitute of all vestiges of\r\norganic bodies. In some, the traces of fossils may have been effaced by\r\nwater and acids, at many successive periods; indeed the removal of the\r\ncalcareous matter of fossil shells is proved by the fact of such\r\norganic remains being often replaced by silex or other minerals, and\r\nsometimes by the space once occupied by the fossil being left empty, or\r\nonly marked by a faint impression.\r\n\r\nThose who believed the hypogene rocks to have originated antecedently\r\nto the creation of organic beings, imputed the absence of lime, so\r\nremarkable in metamorphic strata, to the non-existence of those\r\nmollusca and zoophytes by which shells and corals are secreted; but\r\nwhen we ascribe the crystalline formations to Plutonic action, it is\r\nnatural to inquire whether this action itself may not tend to expel\r\ncarbonic acid and lime from the materials which it reduces to fusion or\r\nsemi-fusion. Not only carbonate of lime, but also free carbonic acid\r\ngas, is given off plentifully from the soil and crevices of rocks in\r\nregions of active and spent volcanoes, as near Naples and in Auvergne.\r\nBy this process, fossil shells or corals may often lose their carbonic\r\nacid, and the residual lime may enter into the composition of augite,\r\nhornblende, garnet, and other hypogene minerals. Although we cannot\r\ndescend into the subterranean regions where volcanic heat is developed,\r\nwe can observe in regions of extinct volcanoes, such as Auvergne and\r\nTuscany, hundreds of springs, both cold and thermal, flowing out from\r\ngranite and other rocks, and having their waters plentifully charged\r\nwith carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nIf all the calcareous matter transferred in the course of ages by these\r\nand thousands of other springs from the lower part of the earth’s crust\r\nto the atmosphere could be presented to us in a solid form, we should\r\nfind that its volume was comparable to that of many a chain of hills.\r\nCalcareous matter is poured into lakes and the ocean by a thousand\r\nsprings and rivers; so that part of almost every new calcareous rock\r\nchemically precipitated, and of many reefs of shelly and coralline\r\nstone, must be derived from mineral matter subtracted by Plutonic\r\nagency, and driven up by gas and steam from fused and heated rocks in\r\nthe bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of limestone in many extensive regions of metamorphic\r\nrocks, as in the Eastern and Southern Grampians of Scotland, may have\r\nbeen the result of some action of this kind; and if the limestones of\r\nthe Lower Laurentian in Canada afford a remarkable exception to the\r\ngeneral rule, we must not forget that it is precisely in this most\r\nancient formation that the _Eozoon Canadense_ has been found. The fact\r\nthat some distinct bands of limestone from 700 to 1500 feet thick occur\r\nhere, may be connected with the escape from destruction of some few\r\ntraces of organic life, even in a rock in which metamorphic action has\r\ngone so far as to produce serpentine, augite, and other minerals found\r\nlargely intermixed with the carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n [1] See notices of Savi, Hoffman, and others, referred to by Boué,\r\n Bull. de la Soc.

Such\r\nveins appear to have once been chinks or small cavities, caused, like\r\ncracks in clay, by the shrinking of the mass, during desiccation, or in\r\npassing from a higher to a lower temperature. Siliceous, calcareous,\r\nand occasionally metallic matters have sometimes found their way\r\nsimultaneously into such empty spaces, by infiltration from the\r\nsurrounding rocks. Mixed with hot water and steam, metallic ores may\r\nhave permeated the mass until they reached those receptacles formed by\r\nshrinkage, and thus gave rise to that irregular assemblage of veins,\r\ncalled by the Germans a “stockwerk,” in allusion to the different\r\nfloors on which the mining operations are in such cases carried on.\r\n\r\nThe more ordinary or regular veins are usually worked in vertical\r\nshafts, and have evidently been fissures produced by mechanical\r\nviolence. They traverse all kinds of rocks, both hypogene and\r\nfossiliferous, and extend downward to indefinite or unknown depths. We\r\nmay assume that they correspond with such rents as we see caused from\r\ntime to time by the shock of an earthquake. Metalliferous veins\r\nreferable to such agency are occasionally a few inches wide, but more\r\ncommonly three or four feet. They hold their course continuously in a\r\ncertain prevailing direction for miles or leagues, passing through\r\nrocks varying in mineral composition.\r\n\r\nThat Metalliferous Veins were Fissures.—As some intelligent miners,\r\nafter an attentive study of metalliferous veins, have been unable to\r\nreconcile many of their characteristics with the hypothesis of\r\nfissures, I shall begin by stating the evidence in its favour. The most\r\nstriking fact, perhaps, which can be adduced in its support is, the\r\ncoincidence of a considerable proportion of mineral veins with\r\n_faults,_ or those dislocations of rocks which are indisputably due to\r\nmechanical force, as above explained (p. 87). There are even proofs in\r\nalmost every mining district of a succession of faults, by which the\r\nopposite walls of rents, now the receptacles of metallic substances,\r\nhave suffered displacement. Thus, for example, suppose _a a,_ Fig. 629,\r\nto be a tin lode in Cornwall, the term _lode_ being applied to veins\r\ncontaining metallic ores. This lode, running east and west, is a yard\r\nwide, and is shifted by a copper lode (_b b_) of similar width. The\r\nfirst fissure (_a a_) has been filled with various materials, partly of\r\nchemical origin, such as quartz, fluor-spar, peroxide of tin, sulphuret\r\nof copper, arsenical pyrites, bismuth, and sulphuret of nickel, and\r\npartly of mechanical origin, comprising clay and angular fragments or\r\ndetritus of the intersected rocks. The plates of quartz and the ores\r\nare, in some places, parallel to the vertical sides or walls of the\r\nvein, being divided from each other by alternating layers of clay or\r\nother earthy matter. Occasionally the metallic ores are disseminated in\r\ndetached masses among the vein-stones.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, after the gradual introduction of the tin and other\r\nsubstances, the second rent (_b b_) was produced by another fracture\r\naccompanied by a displacement of the rocks along the plane of _b b._\r\nThis new opening was then filled with minerals, some of them resembling\r\nthose in _a a,_ as fluor-spar (or fluate of lime) and quartz; others\r\ndifferent, the copper being plentiful and the tin wanting or very\r\nscarce. We must next suppose a third movement to occur, breaking\r\nasunder all the rocks along the line _c c,_ Fig. 630; the fissure, in\r\nthis instance, being only six inches wide, and simply filled with clay,\r\nderived, probably, from the friction of the walls of the rent, or\r\npartly, perhaps, washed in from above. This new movement has displaced\r\nthe rock in such a manner as to interrupt the continuity of the copper\r\nvein (_b b_), and, at the same time, to shift or heave laterally in the\r\nsame direction a portion of the tin vein which had not previously been\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nVertical sections of the mine at Huel Peever, Redruth, Cornwall. Fig.\r\n629: Tin; Fig. 630: Copper; Fig. 631: Clay.\r\n\r\nAgain, in Fig. 631 we see evidence of a fourth fissure (_d d_), also\r\nfilled with clay, which has cut through the tin vein (_a a_), and has\r\nlifted it slightly upward towards the south. The various changes here\r\nrepresented are not ideal, but are exhibited in a section obtained in\r\nworking an old Cornish mine, long since abandoned, in the parish of\r\nRedruth, called Huel Peever, and described both by Mr. Williams and Mr.\r\nCarne.[1] The principal movement here referred to, or that of _c c,_\r\nFig. 631, extends through a space of no less than 84 feet; but in this,\r\nas in the case of the other three, it will be seen that the outline of\r\nthe country above, _d, c, b, a,_ etc., or the geographical features of\r\nCornwall, are not affected by any of the dislocations, a powerful\r\ndenuding force having clearly been exerted subsequently to all the\r\nfaults. (See p. 93.) It is commonly said in Cornwall, that there are\r\neight distinct systems of veins, which can in like manner be referred\r\nto as many successive movements or fractures; and the German miners of\r\nthe Hartz Mountains speak also of eight systems of veins, referable to\r\nas many periods.\r\n\r\nBesides the proofs of mechanical action already explained, the opposite\r\nwalls of veins are often beautifully polished, as if glazed, and are\r\nnot unfrequently striated or scored with parallel furrows and ridges,\r\nsuch as would be produced by the continued rubbing together of surfaces\r\nof unequal hardness. These smoothed surfaces resemble the rocky floor\r\nover which a glacier has passed (see Fig. 106). They are common even in\r\ncases where there has been no shift, and occur equally in\r\nnon-metalliferous fissures. They are called by miners “slicken-sides,”\r\nfrom the German _schlichten,_ to plane, and _seite,_ side. It is\r\nsupposed that the lines of the striæ indicate the direction in which\r\nthe rocks were moved.\r\n\r\nIn some of the veins in the mountain limestone of Derbyshire,\r\ncontaining lead, the vein-stuff, which is nearly compact, is\r\noccasionally traversed by what may be called a vertical crack passing\r\ndown the middle of the vein. The two faces in contact are\r\nslicken-sides, well polished and fluted, and sometimes covered by a\r\nthin coating of lead-ore. When one side of the vein-stuff is removed,\r\nthe other side cracks, especially if small holes be made in it, and\r\nfragments fly off with loud explosions, and continue to do so for some\r\ndays. The miner, availing himself of this circumstance, makes with his\r\npick small holes about six inches apart, and four inches deep, and on\r\nhis return in a few hours finds every part ready broken to his hand.[2]\r\n\r\nThat a great many veins communicated originally with the surface of the\r\ncountry above, or with the bed of the sea, is proved by the occurrence\r\nin them of well-rounded pebbles, agreeing with those in superficial\r\nalluviums, as in Auvergne and Saxony. Marine fossil shells, also, have\r\nbeen found at great depths, having probably been ingulfed during\r\nsubmarine earthquakes. Thus, a gryphæa is stated by M. Virlet to have\r\nbeen met with in a lead-mine near Semur, in France, and a madrepore in\r\na compact vein of cinnabar in Hungary.[3] In Bohemia, similar pebbles\r\nhave been met with at the depth of 180 fathoms; and in Cornwall, Mr.\r\nCarne mentions true pebbles of quartz and slate in a tin lode of the\r\nRelistran Mine, at the depth of 600 feet below the surface. They were\r\ncemented by oxide of tin and bisulphuret of copper, and were traced\r\nover a space more than twelve feet long and as many wide.[4] When\r\ndifferent sets or systems of veins occur in the same country, those\r\nwhich are supposed to be of contemporaneous origin, and which are\r\nfilled with the same kind of metals, often maintain a general\r\nparallelism of direction. Thus, for example, both the tin and copper\r\nveins in Cornwall run nearly east and west, while the lead veins run\r\nnorth and south; but there is no general law of direction common to\r\ndifferent mining districts. The parallelism of the veins is another\r\nreason for regarding them as ordinary fissures, for we observe that\r\nfaults and trap dikes, admitted by all to be masses of melted matter\r\nwhich have filled rents, are often parallel.\r\n\r\n_Fracture, Re-opening and Successive Formation of Veins._—Assuming,\r\nthen, that veins are simply fissures in which chemical and mechanical\r\ndeposits have accumulated, we may next consider the proofs of their\r\nhaving been filled gradually and often during successive enlargements.\r\n\r\nWerner observed, in a vein near Gersdorff, in Saxony, no less than\r\nthirteen beds of different minerals, arranged with the utmost\r\nregularity on each side of the central layer. This layer was formed of\r\ntwo plates of calcareous spar, which had evidently lined the opposite\r\nwalls of a vertical cavity. The thirteen beds followed each other in\r\ncorresponding order, consisting of fluor-spar, heavy spar, galena, etc.\r\nIn these cases the central mass has been last formed, and the two\r\nplates which coat the walls of the rent on each side are the oldest of\r\nall. If they consist of crystalline precipitates, they may be explained\r\nby supposing the fissure to have remained unaltered in its dimensions,\r\nwhile a series of changes occurred in the nature of the solutions which\r\nrose up from below: but such a mode of deposition, in the case of many\r\nsuccessive and parallel layers, appears to be exceptional.\r\n\r\nIf a vein-stone consist of crystalline matter, the points of the\r\ncrystals are always turned inward, or towards the centre of the vein;\r\nin other words, they point in the direction where there was space for\r\nthe development of the crystals. Thus each new layer receives the\r\nimpression of the crystals of the preceding layer, and imprints its\r\ncrystals on the one which follows, until at length the whole of the\r\nvein is filled: the two layers which meet dovetail the points of their\r\ncrystals the one into the other. But in Cornwall, some lodes occur\r\nwhere the vertical plates, or _combs,_ as they are there called,\r\nexhibit crystals so dovetailed as to prove that the same fissure has\r\nbeen often enlarged. Sir H. De la Beche gives the following curious and\r\ninstructive example (Fig. 632), from a copper-mine in granite, near\r\nRedruth.[5] Each of the plates or combs (_a, b, c, d, e, f_) is double,\r\nhaving the points of their crystals turned inward along the axis of the\r\ncomb. The sides or walls (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) are parted by a thin\r\ncovering of ochreous clay, so that each comb is readily separable from\r\nanother by a moderate blow of the hammer. The breadth of each\r\nrepresents the whole width of the fissure at six successive periods,\r\nand the outer walls of the vein, where the first narrow rent was\r\nformed, consisted of the granitic surfaces 1 and 7.\r\n\r\nFig. 632: Copper lode, near Redruth, enlarged at six successive\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nA somewhat analogous interpretation is applicable to many other cases,\r\nwhere clay, sand, or angular detritus, alternate with ores and\r\nvein-stones. Thus, we may imagine the sides of a fissure to be\r\nincrusted with siliceous matter, as Von Buch observed, in Lancerote,\r\nthe walls of a volcanic crater formed in 1731 to be traversed by an\r\nopen rent in which hot vapours had deposited hydrate of silica, the\r\nincrustation nearly extending to the middle.[6] Such a vein may then be\r\nfilled with clay or sand, and afterwards re-opened, the new rent\r\ndividing the argillaceous deposit, and allowing a quantity of rubbish\r\nto fall down. Various metals and spars may then be precipitated from\r\naqueous solutions among the interstices of this heterogeneous mass.\r\n\r\nThat such changes have repeatedly occurred, is demonstrated by\r\noccasional cross-veins, implying the oblique fracture of previously\r\nformed chemical and mechanical deposits. Thus, for example, M. Fournet,\r\nin his description of some mines in Auvergne worked under his\r\nsuperintendence, observes that the granite of that country was first\r\npenetrated by veins of granite, and then dislocated, so that open rents\r\ncrossed both the granite and the granitic veins. Into such openings,\r\nquartz, accompanied by sulphurets of iron and arsenical pyrites, was\r\nintroduced. Another convulsion then burst open the rocks along the old\r\nline of fracture, and the first set of deposits were cracked and often\r\nshattered, so that the new rent was filled, not only with angular\r\nfragments of the adjoining rocks, but with pieces of the older\r\nvein-stones. Polished and striated surfaces on the sides or in the\r\ncontents of the vein also attest the reality of these movements. A new\r\nperiod of repose then ensued, during which various sulphurets were\r\nintroduced, together with hornstone quartz, by which angular fragments\r\nof the older quartz before mentioned were cemented into a breccia. This\r\nperiod was followed by other dilatations of the same veins, and the\r\nintroduction of other sets of mineral deposits, as well as of pebbles\r\nof the basaltic lavas of Auvergne, derived from superficial alluviums,\r\nprobably of Miocene or even Older Pliocene date. Such repeated\r\nenlargement and re-opening of veins might have been anticipated, if we\r\nadopt the theory of fissures, and reflect how few of them have ever\r\nbeen sealed up entirely, and that a country with fissures only\r\npartially filled must naturally offer much feebler resistance along the\r\nold lines of fracture than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nCause of alternate Contraction and Swelling of Veins.—A large\r\nproportion of metalliferous veins have their opposite walls nearly\r\nparallel, and sometimes over a wide extent of country. There is a fine\r\nexample of this in the celebrated vein of Andreasburg in the Hartz,\r\nwhich has been worked for a depth of 500 yards perpendicularly, and 200\r\nhorizontally, retaining almost everywhere a width of three feet. But\r\nmany lodes in Cornwall and elsewhere are extremely variable in size,\r\nbeing one or two inches in one part, and then eight or ten feet in\r\nanother, at the distance of a few fathoms, and then again narrowing as\r\nbefore. Such alternate swelling and contraction is so often\r\ncharacteristic as to require explanation. The walls of fissures in\r\ngeneral, observes Sir H. De la Beche, are rarely perfect planes\r\nthroughout their entire course, nor could we well expect them to be so,\r\nsince they commonly pass through rocks of unequal hardness and\r\ndifferent mineral composition. If, therefore, the opposite sides of\r\nsuch irregular fissures slide upon each other, that is to say, if there\r\nbe a fault, as in the case of so many mineral veins, the parallelism of\r\nthe opposite walls is at once entirely destroyed, as will be readily\r\nseen by studying Figs. 633 to 635.\r\n\r\nLet _a b,_ Fig. 633, be a line of fracture traversing a rock, and let\r\n_a b,_ Fig. 634, represent the same line. Now, if we cut in two a piece\r\nof paper representing this line, and then move the lower portion of\r\nthis cut paper sideways from _a_ to _a′_, taking care that the two\r\npieces of paper still touch each other at the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we\r\nobtain an irregular aperture at _c,_ and isolated cavities at _d, d,\r\nd,_ and when we compare such figures with nature we find that, with\r\ncertain modifications, they represent the interior of faults and\r\nmineral veins. If, instead of sliding the cut paper to the right hand,\r\nwe move the lower part towards the left, about the same distance that\r\nit was previously slid to the right, we obtain considerable variation\r\nin the cavities so produced, two long irregular open spaces, _f, f,_\r\nFig. 635, being then formed. This will serve to show to what slight\r\ncircumstances considerable variations in the character of the openings\r\nbetween unevenly fractured surfaces may be due, such surfaces being\r\nmoved upon each other, so as to have numerous points of contact.\r\n\r\nFigs. 633, 634, 635: Lines of fracture traversing a rock.\r\n\r\nFig. 636: Nipped ores where the course of a vein departs from\r\nverticality.\r\n\r\nMost lodes are perpendicular to the horizon, or nearly so; but some of\r\nthem have a considerable inclination or “hade,” as it is termed, the\r\nangles of dip being very various. The course of a vein is frequently\r\nvery straight; but if tortuous, it is found to be choked up with clay,\r\nstones, and pebbles, at points where it departs most widely from\r\nverticality. Hence at places, such as _a,_ Fig. 636, the miner\r\ncomplains that the ores are “nipped,” or greatly reduced in quantity,\r\nthe space for their free deposition having been interfered with in\r\nconsequence of the pre-occupancy of the lode by earthy materials. When\r\nlodes are many fathoms wide, they are usually filled for the most part\r\nwith earthy matter, and fragments of rock, through which the ores are\r\ndisseminated. The metallic substances frequently coat or encircle\r\ndetached pieces of rock, which our miners call “horses” or “riders.”\r\nThat we should find some mineral veins which split into branches is\r\nalso natural, for we observe the same in regard to open fissures.\r\n\r\nChemical Deposits in Veins.—If we now turn from the mechanical to the\r\nchemical agencies which have been instrumental in the production of\r\nmineral veins, it may be remarked that those parts of fissures which\r\nwere choked up with the ruins of fractured rocks must always have been\r\nfilled with water; and almost every vein has probably been the channel\r\nby which hot springs, so common in countries of volcanoes and\r\nearthquakes, have made their way to the surface. For we know that the\r\nrents in which ores abound extend downward to vast depths, where the\r\ntemperature of the interior of the earth is more elevated. We also know\r\nthat mineral veins are most metalliferous near the contact of Plutonic\r\nand stratified formations, especially where the former send veins into\r\nthe latter, a circumstance which indicates an original proximity of\r\nveins at their inferior extremity to igneous and heated rocks. It is\r\nmoreover acknowledged that even those mineral and thermal springs\r\nwhich, in the present state of the globe, are far from volcanoes, are\r\nnevertheless observed to burst out along great lines of upheaval and\r\ndislocation of rocks.[7] It is also ascertained that all the substances\r\nwith which hot springs are impregnated agree with those discharged in a\r\ngaseous form from volcanoes. Many of these bodies occur as vein-stones;\r\nsuch as silex, carbonate of lime, sulphur, fluor-spar, sulphate of\r\nbarytes, magnesia, oxide of iron, and others. I may add that, if veins\r\nhave been filled with gaseous emanations from masses of melted matter,\r\nslowly cooling in the subterranean regions, the contraction of such\r\nmasses as they pass from a plastic to a solid state would, according to\r\nthe experiments of Deville on granite (a rock which may be taken as a\r\nstandard), produce a reduction in volume amounting to 10 per cent. The\r\nslow crystallisation, therefore, of such Plutonic rocks supplies us\r\nwith a force not only capable of rending open the incumbent rocks by\r\ncausing a failure of support, but also of giving rise to faults\r\nwhenever one portion of the earth’s crust subsides slowly while another\r\ncontiguous to it happens to rest on a different foundation, so as to\r\nremain unmoved.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are led to infer, from the foregoing reasoning, that there\r\nhas often been an intimate connection between metalliferous veins and\r\nhot springs holding mineral matter in solution, yet we must not on that\r\naccount expect that the contents of hot springs and mineral veins would\r\nbe identical. On the contrary, M. E. de Beaumont has judiciously\r\nobserved that we ought to find in veins those substances which, being\r\nleast soluble, are not discharged by hot springs—or that class of\r\nsimple and compound bodies which the thermal waters ascending from\r\nbelow would first precipitate on the walls of a fissure, as soon as\r\ntheir temperature began slightly to diminish. The higher they mount\r\ntowards the surface, the more will they cool, till they acquire the\r\naverage temperature of springs, being in that case chiefly charged with\r\nthe most soluble substances, such as the alkalies, soda and potash.\r\nThese are not met with in veins, although they enter so largely into\r\nthe composition of granitic rocks.[8]\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, therefore, the arrangement and distribution of\r\nmetallic matter in veins may be referred to ordinary chemical action,\r\nor to those variations in temperature which waters holding the ores in\r\nsolution must undergo, as they rise upward from great depths in the\r\nearth. But there are other phenomena which do not admit of the same\r\nsimple explanation. Thus, for example, in Derbyshire, veins containing\r\nores of lead, zinc, and copper, but chiefly lead, traverse alternate\r\nbeds of limestone and greenstone. The ore is plentiful where the walls\r\nof the rent consist of limestone, but is reduced to a mere string when\r\nthey are formed of greenstone, or “toad-stone,” as it is called\r\nprovincially. Not that the original fissure is narrower where the\r\ngreenstone occurs, but because more of the space is there filled with\r\nvein-stones, and the waters at such points have not parted so freely\r\nwith their metallic contents.\r\n\r\n“Lodes in Cornwall,” says Mr. Robert W. Fox, “are very much influenced\r\nin their metallic riches by the nature of the rock which they traverse,\r\nand they often change in this respect very suddenly, in passing from\r\none rock to another. Thus many lodes which yield abundance of ore in\r\ngranite, are unproductive in clay-slate, or killas and _vice versa._\r\n\r\nSupposed relative Age of the different Metals.—After duly reflecting on\r\nthe facts above described, we cannot doubt that mineral veins, like\r\neruptions of granite or trap, are referable to many distinct periods of\r\nthe earth’s history, although it may be more difficult to determine the\r\nprecise age of veins; because they have often remained open for ages,\r\nand because, as we have seen, the same fissure, after having been once\r\nfilled, has frequently been re-opened or enlarged. But besides this\r\ndiversity of age, it has been supposed by some geologists that certain\r\nmetals have been produced exclusively in earlier, others in more modern\r\ntimes; that tin, for example, is of higher antiquity than copper,\r\ncopper than lead or silver, and all of them more ancient than gold. I\r\nshall first point out that the facts once relied upon in support of\r\nsome of these views are contradicted by later experience, and then\r\nconsider how far any chronological order of arrangement can be\r\nrecognised in the position of the precious and other metals in the\r\nearth’s crust.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is not true that veins in which tin abounds are\r\nthe oldest lodes worked in Great Britain. The government survey of\r\nIreland has demonstrated that in Wexford veins of copper and lead (the\r\nlatter as usual being argentiferous) are much older than the tin of\r\nCornwall. In each of the two countries a very similar series of\r\ngeological changes has occurred at two distinct epochs—in Wexford,\r\nbefore the Devonian strata were deposited; in Cornwall, after the\r\nCarboniferous epoch. To begin with the Irish mining district: We have\r\ngranite in Wexford traversed by granite veins, which veins also intrude\r\nthemselves into the Silurian strata, the same Silurian rocks as well as\r\nthe veins having been denuded before the Devonian beds were\r\nsuperimposed. Next we find, in the same county, that elvans, or\r\nstraight dikes of porphyritic granite, have cut through the granite and\r\nthe veins before mentioned, but have not penetrated the Devonian rocks.\r\nSubsequently to these elvans, veins of copper and lead were produced,\r\nbeing of a date certainly posterior to the Silurian, and anterior to\r\nthe Devonian; for they do not enter the latter, and, what is still more\r\ndecisive, streaks or layers of derivative copper have been found near\r\nWexford in the Devonian, not far from points where mines of copper are\r\nworked in the Silurian strata.\r\n\r\nAlthough the precise age of such copper lodes cannot be defined, we may\r\nsafely affirm that they were either filled at the close of the Silurian\r\nor commencement of the Devonian period. Besides copper, lead, and\r\nsilver, there is some gold in these ancient or primary metalliferous\r\nveins. A few fragments also of tin found in Wicklow in the drift are\r\nsupposed to have been derived from veins of the same age.[9]\r\n\r\nNext, if we turn to Cornwall, we find there also the monuments of a\r\nvery analogous sequence of events. First, the granite was formed; then,\r\nabout the same period, veins of fine-grained granite, often tortuous\r\n(see Fig. 614), penetrating both the outer crust of granite and the\r\nadjoining fossiliferous or primary rocks, including the coal-measures;\r\nthirdly, elvans, holding their course straight through granite,\r\ngranitic veins, and fossiliferous slates; fourthly, veins of tin also\r\ncontaining copper, the first of those eight systems of fissures of\r\ndifferent ages already alluded to, p. 607. Here, then, the tin lodes\r\nare newer than the elvans. It has, indeed, been stated by some Cornish\r\nminers that the elvans are in some instances posterior to the oldest\r\ntin-bearing lodes, but the observations of Sir H. de la Beche during\r\nthe survey led him to an opposite conclusion, and he has shown how the\r\ncases referred to in corroboration can be otherwise interpreted.[10] We\r\nmay, therefore, assert that the most ancient Cornish lodes are younger\r\nthan the coal-measures of that part of England, and it follows that\r\nthey are of a much later date than the Irish copper and lead of Wexford\r\nand some adjoining counties. How much later, it is not so easy to\r\ndeclare, although probably they are not newer than the beginning of the\r\nPermian period, as no tin lodes have been discovered in any red\r\nsandstone which overlies the coal in the south-west of England.\r\n\r\nThere are lead veins in Glamorganshire which enter the lias, and others\r\nnear Frome, in Somersetshire, which have been traced into the Inferior\r\nOolite. In Bohemia, the rich veins of silver of Joachimsthal cut\r\nthrough basalt containing olivine, which overlies tertiary lignite, in\r\nwhich are leaves of dicotyledonous trees. This silver, therefore, is\r\ndecidedly a tertiary formation. In regard to the age of the gold of the\r\nUral mountains, in Russia, which, like that of California, is obtained\r\nchiefly from auriferous alluvium, it occurs in veins of quartz in the\r\nschistose and granitic rocks of that chain, and is supposed by Sir R.\r\nMurchison, MM. Deverneuil and Keyserling to be newer than the syenitic\r\ngranite of the Ural—perhaps of tertiary date. They observe that no gold\r\nhas yet been found in the Permian conglomerates which lie at the base\r\nof the Ural Mountains, although large quantities of iron and copper\r\ndetritus are mixed with the pebbles of those Permian strata. Hence it\r\nseems that the Uralian quartz veins, containing gold and platinum, were\r\nnot formed, or certainly not exposed to aqueous denudation, during the\r\nPermian era.\r\n\r\nIn the auriferous alluvium of Russia, California, and Australia, the\r\nbones of extinct land-quadrupeds have been met with, those of the\r\nmammoth being common in the gravel at the foot of the Ural Mountains,\r\nwhile in Australia they consist of huge marsupials, some of them of the\r\nsize of the rhinoceros and allied to the living wombat. They belong to\r\nthe genera Diprotodon and Nototherium of Professor Owen. The gold of\r\nNorthern Chili is associated in the mines of Los Hornos with copper\r\npyrites, in veins traversing the cretaceo-oolitic formations, so-called\r\nbecause its fossils have the character partly of the cretaceous and\r\npartly of the oolitic fauna of Europe.[11] The gold found in the United\r\nStates, in the mountainous parts of Virginia, North and South Carolina,\r\nand Georgia, occurs in metamorphic Silurian strata, as well as in\r\nauriferous gravel derived from the same.\r\n\r\nGold has now been detected in almost every kind of rock, in slate,\r\nquartzite, sandstone, limestone, granite, and serpentine, both in veins\r\nand in the rocks themselves at short distances from the veins. In\r\nAustralia it has been worked successfully not only in alluvium, but in\r\nvein-stones in the native rock, generally consisting of Silurian shales\r\nand slates. It has been traced on that continent over more than nine\r\ndegrees of latitude (between the parallels of 30° and 39° S.), and over\r\ntwelve of longitude, and yielded in 1853 an annual supply equal, if not\r\nsuperior, to that of California; nor is there any apparent prospect of\r\nthis supply diminishing, still less of the exhaustion of the\r\ngold-fields.\r\n\r\n_Origin of Gold in California._—Mr. J. Arthur Phillips,[12] in his\r\ntreatise “On the Gold Fields of California,” has shown that the ore in\r\nthe gold workings is derived from drifts, or gravel clay, and sand, of\r\ntwo distinct geological ages, both comparatively modern, but belonging\r\nto different river-systems, the older of which is so ancient as to be\r\ncapped by a thick sheet of lava divided by basaltic columns. The\r\nauriferous quartz of these drifts is derived from veins apparently due\r\nto hydrothermal agency, proceeding from granite and penetrating strata\r\nsupposed to be of Jurassic and Triassic date. The fossil wood of the\r\ndrift is sometimes beautifully silicified, and occasionally the trunks\r\nof trees are replaced by iron pyrites, but gold seems not to have been\r\nfound as in the pyrites of similarly petrified trees in the drift of\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe formation of recent metalliferous veins is now going on, according\r\nto Mr. Phillips, in various parts of the Pacific coast. Thus, for\r\nexample, there are fissures at the foot of the eastern declivity of the\r\nSierra Nevada in the state of that name, from which boiling water and\r\nsteam escape, forming siliceous incrustations on the sides of the\r\nfissures. In one case, where the fissure is partially filled up with\r\nsilica inclosing iron and copper pyrites, gold has also been found in\r\nthe vein-stone.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked by M. de Beaumont, that lead and some other metals\r\nare found in dikes of basalt and greenstone, as well as in mineral\r\nveins connected with trap-rock, whereas tin is met with in granite and\r\nin veins associated with the Plutonic series. If this rule hold true\r\ngenerally, the geological position of tin accessible to the miner will\r\nbelong, for the most part, to rocks older than those bearing lead. The\r\ntin veins will be of higher relative antiquity for the same reason that\r\nthe “underlying” igneous formations or granites which are visible to\r\nman are older, on the whole, than the overlying or trappean formations.\r\n\r\nIf different sets of fissures, originating simultaneously at different\r\nlevels in the earth’s crust, and communicating, some of them with\r\nvolcanic, others with heated Plutonic masses, be filled with different\r\nmetals, it will follow that those formed farthest from the surface will\r\nusually require the longest time before they can be exposed\r\nsuperficially. In order to bring them into view, or within reach of the\r\nminer, a greater amount of upheaval and denudation must take place in\r\nproportion as they have lain deeper when first formed and filled. A\r\nconsiderable series of geological revolutions must intervene before any\r\npart of the fissure which has been for ages in the proximity of the\r\nPlutonic rock, so as to receive the gases discharged from it when it\r\nwas cooling, can emerge into the atmosphere. But I need not enlarge on\r\nthis subject, as the reader will remember what was said in the 30th,\r\n32nd, and 35th chapters on the chronology of the volcanic and hypogene\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n [1] Geol.
