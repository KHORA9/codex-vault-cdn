In\r\nconsequence of Captain FitzRoy having expressed a desire that some\r\nscientific person should be on board, and having offered to give up part\r\nof his own accommodations, I volunteered my services; and through the\r\nkindness of the hydrographer, Captain Beaufort, my appointment received\r\nthe sanction of the Admiralty. I must here, as on all other occasions,\r\ntake the opportunity of publicly acknowledging with gratitude, the\r\nobligation under which I lie to Captain FitzRoy, and to all the Officers\r\non board the Beagle, for their constant assistance in my scientific\r\npursuits, and for their uniform kindness to me throughout the voyage. On\r\nmy return (October, 1836) to England, I found myself in possession of a\r\nlarge collection of specimens in various branches of natural history;\r\nbut from the great expense necessary to secure their publication, I was\r\nwithout the means of rendering them generally serviceable.\r\n\r\nThe Presidents of the Linnean, Zoological, and Geological Societies,\r\nhaving given me their opinion respecting the utility to be derived from\r\npublishing these materials, I addressed a letter to the Right Honourable\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer (T. Spring Rice, Esq.) informing him of\r\nthe circumstances under which I hoped that I might venture to solicit\r\nthe aid of Government. In reply, I received a communication (as below)\r\nannouncing to me that the Lords of the Treasury, from their readiness to\r\npromote Science, were willing, under certain conditions, to give me the\r\nmost liberal assistance.\r\n\r\n                                  “_Treasury Chambers, August 31, 1837._\r\n\r\n  “SIR,\r\n\r\n  “It having been represented to the Lords Commissioners of Her\r\n  Majesty’s Treasury, from various quarters, that great advantage would\r\n  be derived to the Science of Natural History, if arrangements could be\r\n  made for enabling you to publish, in a convenient form, and at a cheap\r\n  rate, the result of your labours in that branch of science, my Lords\r\n  will feel themselves justified in giving their sanction to the\r\n  application of a sum, not exceeding in the whole one thousand pounds,\r\n  in aid of such a publication; upon the clear and distinct\r\n  understanding that the Work should be published, and the plates\r\n  engraved, in such a manner as to be most advantageous to the Public at\r\n  large, upon a plan of arrangement to be previously submitted to, and\r\n  sanctioned by the Board, after consultation with those persons, who,\r\n  from their attainments in this branch of science, are the most capable\r\n  of advising their Lordships thereupon; and that the payments on\r\n  account of the said sum of one thousand pounds are to be made to you\r\n  from time to time, on a certificate that such progress has been made\r\n  in the engravings, in accordance with the plan previously approved of,\r\n  as to justify the issue then applied for. My Lords have therefore\r\n  directed me to communicate to you the views they entertain upon this\r\n  subject; and to apprize you that they will be prepared to act in\r\n  conformity with their arrangement, upon learning from you that you are\r\n  ready to proceed with the Work upon the principles above laid down,\r\n  and upon receiving from you a statement of the manner in which you\r\n  think the Work should be published, and the plates engraved, so as\r\n  most effectually to accomplish the object my Lords have in view, in\r\n  sanctioning the payment from the Public Funds, in aid of the expenses\r\n  of the Work in question.\r\n\r\n                                               “I remain,\r\n                                       “Sir, Your Obedient Servant,\r\n                                                       “A. Y. SPEARMAN.”\r\n\r\nThe object of the present Work is to give descriptions and figures of\r\nundescribed and imperfectly known animals, both fossil and recent,\r\ntogether with some account, in the one case, of their geological\r\nposition, and in the other of their habits and ranges. As I do not\r\npossess the knowledge requisite for such an undertaking, and as I am,\r\nmoreover, particularly engaged in preparing an account of the geological\r\nobservations, made during the voyage, several gentlemen have most kindly\r\nundertaken different portions of the Work. Besides the very great\r\nadvantage insured in thus enlisting the attainments of these Naturalists\r\nin the several departments of science, to which they have paid most\r\nattention, a great delay is avoided by adopting this method of\r\npublication, which must otherwise have been incurred before the\r\nmaterials could have been made known.\r\n\r\nAn Account of the Voyage, drawn up by Captain FitzRoy, (and to which I\r\nhave added a volume) being on the point of publication, I shall not in\r\nthis Work enter on any minute details respecting the countries which\r\nwere visited, but shall merely give a sketch of the geology in the\r\nintroduction to the part containing Fossil Mammalia, and a brief\r\ngeographical notice in that attached to the account of existing animals.\r\nAt the conclusion of this Work, I shall endeavour to place together the\r\nleading results in the natural history of the different countries, from\r\nwhich the collections were procured. I may here state that Mr. Owen has\r\nundertaken the description of the Fossil Mammalia; Mr. Waterhouse, the\r\nRecent Mammalia; Mr. Gould, the Birds; Mr. Bell, the Reptiles; and the\r\nRev. L. Jenyns, the Fish. Whatever assistance I may obtain in the\r\ninvertebrate classes, will be noticed in their respective places. The\r\nspecimens have been presented to the various public museums, in which it\r\nwas thought they would be of most general service: mention will be made\r\nin each part where the objects described have been deposited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FOSSIL MAMMALIA,\r\n\r\n                               Described by\r\n\r\n                 RICHARD OWEN, ESQ.

DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Owen having undertaken the description of the fossil remains of the\r\nMammalia, which were collected during the voyage of the Beagle, and\r\nwhich are now deposited in the Museum of the College of Surgeons in\r\nLondon, it remains for me briefly to state the circumstances under which\r\nthey were discovered. As it would require a lengthened discussion to\r\nenter fully on the geological history of the deposits in which these\r\nremains have been preserved, and as this will be the subject of a\r\nseparate work, I shall here only give sufficient details, for the reader\r\nto form some general idea of the epoch, at which these animals lived,—of\r\ntheir relative antiquity one to the other,—and of the circumstances\r\nunder which their skeletons were embedded. All the remains were found\r\nbetween latitudes 31° and 50° on the eastern side of South America. The\r\nlocalities may conveniently be classed under three divisions, namely—the\r\nProvinces bordering the Plata; Bahia Blanca situated near the confines\r\nof Northern Patagonia; and Southern Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe first division includes an enormous area, abounding with the remains\r\nof large animals. To the eastward and southward of the great streams,\r\nwhich unite to form the estuary of the Plata, those almost boundless\r\nplains extend, which are known by the name of the Pampas. Their physical\r\nconstitution does not vary over a wide extent;—the traveller may pass\r\nfor many hundred miles on a level surface, without meeting with a single\r\npebble, or discovering any change in the nature of the soil. The\r\nformation consists of a reddish argillaceous earth, generally containing\r\nirregular concretions of a pale brown, indurated marl. This stone, where\r\nmost compact, is traversed by small linear cavities, and in several\r\nrespects resembles the less pure fresh-water limestones of Europe. The\r\nconcretions not unfrequently become so numerous, that they unite and\r\nform a continuous stratum, or even the entire mass.\r\n\r\nAt Bajada de St^a. Fé, in the Province of Entre Rios, beds of sand,\r\nlimestone, and clay of different qualities, containing sharks’ teeth and\r\nsea-shells, underlie the Pampas deposit. The shells, although numerous,\r\nare few in kind. Mr. George B. Sowerby informs me that they appear to\r\nbelong to one of the less ancient tertiary epochs; they consist of\r\n_Venus nov. spec._ near to _V. cancellata_; _Arca nov. spec._ near to\r\n_A. antiquata_; a very large oyster, probably an extinct species; an\r\nimperfect specimen of a second species of oyster near to _O. edulis_;\r\nand a _Pecten_ near to _P. opercularis_. These beds pass upwards into an\r\nindurated marl, and this again into the red argillaceous earth of the\r\nPampas, containing the remains of those extinct quadrupeds, which every\r\nwhere characterize that deposit. To the southward of the Plata level\r\nplains of an uniform composition, interrupted only at wide intervals by\r\nhills of crystalline rock, extend to a distance of about three hundred\r\nmiles; and to the northward for at least an equal space, and probably\r\nmuch further. As might have been expected from the perfectly level\r\nsurface, wherever a continuous section is presented on the banks of the\r\ngreat rivers, very slight changes of colour show, that the deposit has\r\nbeen accumulated in strata as horizontal as the land, or as the\r\nwater-line at the base of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Banda Oriental (to the N. and N. E. of the Plata),\r\nand in part of that of Entre Rios, the land, though very low and level,\r\nhas a foundation of granitic and other primary rocks. These older\r\nformations are partially covered, in most parts, by a reddish earthy\r\nmass containing a few small calcareous concretions; while in other\r\nparts, they are concealed by more regular strata, of indurated marl\r\npassing into limestone, of conglomerates, and ferruginous sandstone. The\r\nentire formation probably belongs to the same epoch with that of the\r\nPampas deposit. In the earthy mass, even where it is of little\r\nthickness, and where it might readily be mistaken for detritus produced\r\nfrom the underlying granites, remains of large quadrupeds have several\r\ntimes been discovered.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of the Plata and in the neighbouring districts, proofs of\r\na change of level having taken place between the land and the water\r\nwithin a recent period, may be observed. Both near Monte Video and\r\nColonia del Sacramiento, beds of shells are lying on the beach at the\r\nheight of several feet above the present tidal action. Near Maldonado I\r\nsaw estuary shells of recent species embedded in clay, and raised above\r\nthe level of a neighbouring fresh-water lake.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Parana, a shell identical with, or most closely\r\nresembling an estuary species (_Potamomya labiata_, now living in that\r\npart of the Plata, where the water is brackish) is accumulated in great\r\nmasses, which are found some miles inland, and are elevated several\r\nyards above the level of the river. Sir Woodbine Parish, also, has in\r\nhis possession, shells procured from an extensive formation near\r\nEnsenada de Barragan (south of Buenos Ayres), which is quarried for\r\nlime. Mr. George Sowerby has examined these fossils, and says the\r\nfollowing are identical with living kinds; _Voluta colocynthis_,\r\nDillwyn: _V. angulata_, Swainson: _Buccinum globulosum_, Kiener: a\r\nvariety of _Oliva patula_: a _Cytheræa_ closely resembling or identical\r\nwith _C. flexuosa_, and a fragment of a second species, probably _C.\r\npurpurascens_; _Potamomya labiata_; and fragments of oysters. There is,\r\nhowever, a species of _Mactra_ in very great numbers, with which Mr.\r\nSowerby is wholly unacquainted. I may observe that I found recent shells\r\nof the first five species inhabiting the coast, a short distance to the\r\nsouthward. Some shelly limestone from the same place, which Sir Woodbine\r\nParish had the kindness to show me, resembles that which I saw at\r\nBajada, and in Banda Oriental. These beds, therefore, probably form\r\nparts of the Pampas deposit, and are not merely indicative of the period\r\nof its elevation. Nevertheless, on the opposite shores of the Plata,\r\nnear the mouth of the Uruguay, I found lines of sand dunes, where the\r\n_Mactra_ and _Cytheræa flexuosa_ were lying in such quantities on the\r\nbare surface, that the inhabitants, by merely sifting the sand, collect\r\nthem for burning into lime.\r\n\r\nAfter these facts we may feel certain, that at a period not very remote,\r\na great bay occupied the area both of the Pampas and of the lower parts\r\nof Banda Oriental. Into this bay the rivers which are now united in the\r\none great stream of the Plata, must formerly have carried down (as\r\nhappens at the present day) the carcasses of the animals, inhabiting the\r\nsurrounding countries; and their skeletons would thus become entombed in\r\nthe estuary mud which was then tranquilly accumulating. Nothing less\r\nthan a long succession of such accidents can account for the vast number\r\nof remains now found buried. As their exposure has invariably been due\r\nto the intersection of the plain by the banks of some stream, it is not\r\nmaking an extravagant assertion, to say, that any line whatever drawn\r\nacross the Pampas would probably cross the skeleton of some extinct\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nAt Bajada, a passage, as I have stated, may be traced upwards from the\r\nbeds containing marine shells, to the estuary mud with the bones of land\r\nanimals. In another locality a bed of the same mineralogical nature with\r\nthe Pampas deposit, underlies clay containing large oysters and other\r\nshells, apparently the same with those at Bajada. We may, therefore,\r\nconclude that at the period when the Arca, Venus, and Oyster were\r\nliving, the physical condition of the surrounding country was nearly the\r\nsame, as at the time when the remains of the mammalia were embedded; and\r\ntherefore that these shells and the extinct quadrupeds probably either\r\nco-existed, or that the interval between their respective existences\r\nwas, in a geological point of view, extremely short. In this part of\r\nSouth America there is reason to believe that the movements of the land\r\nhave been so regular, that the period of its elevation may be taken as\r\nan element in considering the age of any deposit. The circumstance,\r\ntherefore, that the beds immediately bordering the Plata, contain very\r\nnearly the same species of molluscs, with those now existing in the\r\nneighbouring sea, harmonizes perfectly with the more ancient (though\r\nreally modern) tertiary character of the fossils underlying the Pampas\r\ndeposit at Bajada, situated at a greater height, and at a considerable\r\ndistance in the interior. I feel little doubt that the final extinction\r\nof the several large quadrupeds of La Plata did not take place, until\r\nthe time when the sea was peopled with all, or nearly all, its present\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nBahia Blanca, situated in latitude 39°, and about 250 miles south of the\r\nPlata, constitutes the second district, in which I found the remains of\r\nquadrupeds. This large bay is nearly surrounded by very low land, on\r\nwhich successive lines of sand dunes mark in many parts the retreat of\r\nthe water. At some distance inland a formation of highly indurated marl,\r\npassing into limestone, forms an escarpment. Beyond this, rocks of the\r\nsame character extend over a wide and desolate plain, which rises\r\ntowards the flanks of the distant mountain of the Sierra de la Ventana,\r\ncomposed of quartz. On the low shores of this bay, only two places\r\noccur, where any section of the strata can be seen; and at both of these\r\nI found fossil remains.\r\n\r\nAt Monte Hermoso, a line of cliff of about 120 feet in height, consists\r\nin the upper part of a stratum of soft sandstone with quartz pebbles;\r\nand in the lower of a red argillaceous earth, containing concretions of\r\npale indurated marl. This lower bed has the same mineralogical character\r\nwith the Pampas deposit; and possibly may be connected with it. The\r\nembedded bones were blackened, and had undergone more chemical change\r\nthan in any other locality, which I examined. With the exception of a\r\nfew large scattered bones, the remains seemed to belong chiefly to very\r\nsmall quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the bay, called Punta Alta, about eighteen miles from\r\nMonte Hermoso, a very small extent of cliff, about twenty feet high, is\r\nexposed. The lower bed seen at ebb tide, extends over a considerable\r\narea; it consists of a mass of quartz shingle, irregularly stratified,\r\nand divided by curved layers of indurated clay. The pebbles are cemented\r\ntogether by calcareous matter, which results, perhaps, from the partial\r\ndecomposition of numerous embedded shells. In this gravel the remains of\r\nseveral gigantic animals were extraordinarily numerous. The cliff, in\r\nthe part above high-water mark, is chiefly composed of a reddish\r\nindurated argillaceous earth; which either passes into, or is replaced\r\nby, the same kind of gravel, as that on which the whole rests. The\r\nearthy substance is coarser than that at Monte Hermoso, and does not\r\ncontain calcareous concretions. I found in it a very few fragments of\r\nshells, and part of the remains of one quadruped.\r\n\r\nFrom the bones in one of the skeletons, and likewise from those in part\r\nof another, being embedded in their proper relative positions, the\r\ncarcasses of the animals, when they perished, were probably drifted to\r\nthis spot in an entire state. The gravel, from its stratification and\r\ngeneral appearance, exactly resembles that which is every day\r\naccumulating in banks, where either tides or currents meet; and the\r\nembedded shells are of littoral species. But from the skeleton, in one\r\ninstance, being in a position nearly undisturbed, and from the abundance\r\nof serpulæ and encrusting corallines adhering to some of the bones, the\r\nwater, at the time of their burial, must have been deeper than at\r\npresent. This conclusion might also have been inferred from the fact,\r\nthat in the neighbouring cliff the same bed, with its shells, has been\r\nuplifted some yards above high-water mark. On the coast to the southward\r\nabundant proofs occur, of a recent elevation of the continent. In the\r\ngravel, nearly all the pebbles are of quartz, and have originally\r\nproceeded from the lofty range of the Ventana, distant between forty and\r\nfifty miles. Besides the pebbles of quartz, there are a few irregular\r\nmasses of the same indurated marl, of which the escarpment of the\r\nneighbouring great plain is composed. Hence the gravel beds must have\r\nbeen deposited, when the plain existed as dry land; and on it probably\r\nthose great animals once lived, of which we now find only the remains.\r\nThe indurated marl forming the plain, is the same kind of rock with that\r\noccurring over a wide extent of the Pampas; and there is no reason to\r\ndoubt, they are parts of one great formation. Nevertheless, the gravel\r\nbed of Bahia Blanca, although subsequent to the calcareous formation,\r\nmay be of the same age with those parts of the Pampas, which stand at a\r\nlow level near the Plata. For on this whole line of coast, I believe, as\r\nthe land has continued rising, fresh littoral deposits have been formed;\r\nand each of these would often owe part of its materials to the\r\ndegradation of the one last elevated.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the relative age of the Monte Hermoso and Punta Alta\r\nbeds, it is not possible to speak decidedly. A certain degree of\r\nsimilarity in the nature of the strata containing quartz pebbles, and\r\nthose of the reddish indurated earth; and the short distance between the\r\ntwo localities, would indicate that no long interval had intervened. The\r\nbeds at Monte Hermoso, certainly were deposited more tranquilly, and\r\nprobably in a deeper sea; so that even skeletons of animals, no larger\r\nthan rats, have been perfectly preserved there. In some parts of the\r\nsurrounding country, obscure traces of a succession of step-formed\r\nterraces may be observed; and each of these indicates a period of repose\r\nduring the elevation of the land, at which time the strata previously\r\nexisting were worn away, and fresh matter deposited. The Monte Hermoso\r\nbeds were, perhaps, formed during one such interval, anterior to the\r\naccumulation of the shingle bank at Punta Alta.\r\n\r\nMr. G. Sowerby, who has been good enough to examine the shells which\r\nwere found with the remains of the quadrupeds, has given me the\r\nfollowing list.\r\n\r\n  1. _Voluta angulata._\r\n\r\n  2. —— _colocynthis._\r\n\r\n  3. _Oliva Brasiliensis._\r\n\r\n  4. ——                     Nearly related to _O. patula_, but specimen\r\n                              imperfect.\r\n\r\n  5. ——                     Nearly related to _O. oryza_; less nearly to\r\n                              small species now living at Bahia Blanca.\r\n\r\n  6. ——                     _Nov. spec._\r\n\r\n  7. _Buccinum cochlidium._\r\n\r\n  8. —— _globulosum._\r\n\r\n  9. ——                     One or two minute species, perhaps young\r\n                              specimens,—unknown.\r\n\r\n 10. _Trochus_              _Nov. spec._ (?) same as one now living in\r\n                              the bay.\r\n\r\n 11. ——                     _Nov. spec._ (?) nearly related to last;\r\n                              differs in not being granular on the\r\n                              surface.\r\n\r\n 12. _Assiminia_ (?)        Minute species, identical with one living in\r\n                              the bay.\r\n\r\n 13. _Bulinus nucleus._\r\n\r\n 14. _Fissurella_           Probably same as a kind (_nov. spec._ ?)\r\n                              living in the bay.\r\n\r\n 15. _Crepidula muricata._\r\n\r\n 16. ——                     _Nov. spec._\r\n\r\n 17. _Cytheræa_             Closely related to, or identical with _C.\r\n                              purpurascens_.\r\n\r\n 18. _Modiola_              Same as recent kind (_nov. spec._) living in\r\n                              the bay.\r\n\r\n 19. _Nucula_               Near to _N. margaritacea_.\r\n\r\n 20. _Corbula_              Minute species, unknown.\r\n\r\n 21. _Cardita_              Ditto        ditto\r\n\r\n 22. _Pecten_               _Nov. spec._ (?) very imperfect specimen.\r\n\r\n 23. _Ostrea_               Oysters of the same size now live in the\r\n                              bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I may add that a fossil encrusting coralline is the same with one now\r\n                           living in the bay.\r\n\r\nOf these shells it is almost certain that twelve species (and the\r\ncoralline) are absolutely identical with existing species; and that four\r\nmore are perhaps so; the doubt partly arising from the imperfect\r\ncondition of the specimens. Of the seven remaining ones, four are\r\nminute, and one extremely imperfect. If I had not made a collection (far\r\nfrom perfect) of the shells now inhabiting Bahia Blanca, Mr. Sowerby\r\nwould not have known as living kinds, five out of the twelve fossils:\r\ntherefore, it is probable, if more attention had been paid to collecting\r\nthe small living species, some of the seven unknown ones would also have\r\nbeen found in that state. The twelve first shells, as well as the four\r\ndoubtful ones, are not only existing species, but nearly all of them\r\ninhabit this same bay, on the shores of which they are likewise found\r\nfossil. Moreover, at the time, I particularly noticed that the\r\nproportional numbers appeared closely similar between the different\r\nkinds,—in those now cast up on the beach, and in those embedded with the\r\nfossil bones. Under these circumstances, I think, we are justified\r\n(although some of the shells are at present unknown to conchologists) in\r\nconsidering the shingle strata at Punta Alta, as belonging to an\r\nextremely modern epoch.\r\n\r\nFrom the principle already adduced, namely, the regular and gradual\r\nelevation of this part of the continent, I should have judged from the\r\nsmall altitude of the beds at Punta Alta, that the formation had not\r\nbeen very ancient. The conclusion here arrived at, concerning the age of\r\nthese fossil mammalia, is nearly the same, with that, inferred\r\nrespecting those entombed in the Pampas; and it will hereafter be shown,\r\nthat some of the species are common to the two districts. We may\r\nsuppose, that whilst the ancient rivers of the Plata occasionally\r\ncarried down the carcasses of animals existing in that country, and\r\ndeposited them in the mud of the estuary; other animals inhabited the\r\nplains round the Sierra de la Ventana, and that lesser streams, acting\r\ntogether with the currents of a large bay, drifted their remains towards\r\na point, where sand and shingle were accumulating into a shoal. The\r\nwhole area has since been elevated: the estuary mud of the former rivers\r\nhas been converted into wide and level plains; and the shoals of the\r\nancient Bahia Blanca now form low headlands on the present coast.\r\n\r\nThe third locality, which I have to specify, is Port St. Julian, in\r\nlatitude 49° 15′ on the coast of Southern Patagonia. The tertiary plains\r\nof that country are modelled into a succession of broad and level\r\nterraces, which abut one above the other; and where they approach the\r\ncoast, are generally cut off by a line of precipitous cliff. The whole\r\nsurface is thickly covered by a bed of gravel, composed of various kinds\r\nof porphyries, and probably originating from rocks situated within the\r\nCordillera. The lower part of the formation consists of several\r\nvarieties of sandstone, and contains many fossil shells, the greater\r\nnumber of which are not found in a living state.\r\n\r\nThe south side of Port St. Julian is formed by a spit of flat land, of\r\nnearly a hundred feet in height; and on its surface existing species of\r\nlittoral shells are abundantly scattered. The gravel is there covered (a\r\ncircumstance which I did not observe in scarcely any other locality) by\r\na thin but irregular bed of a sandy or loamy soil, which likewise fills\r\nup hollows or channels worn through it. In the largest of these channels\r\nthe remains of the single fossil quadruped, which was here discovered,\r\nwere embedded. The skeleton probably was at first perfect; but the sea\r\nhaving washed away part of the cliff, has removed many of the bones,—the\r\nremaining ones, however, still occupying their proper relative position\r\nto each other. I am inclined to attribute the origin of this earthy\r\nmatter, to the mud which might have accumulated in channels, and on the\r\nsurface of the gravel, if this part of the plain had formerly existed as\r\na harbour, such as Port St. Julian is at the present day. The Guanaco,\r\nthe only large animal now inhabiting the wild plains of Patagonia, often\r\nwanders over the extensive flats, which are left dry at the head of the\r\nharbour during ebb tide: we may imagine that the fossil animal, whilst\r\nin a like manner crossing the ancient bay, fell into one of the muddy\r\ncreeks, and was there buried.\r\n\r\nI have stated that existing species of shells are scattered over the\r\nsurface of this plain; namely, _Mytilus Magellanicus_; a second and\r\nundescribed species, now living on the beach; _M. edulis_; _Patella\r\ndeaurata_; and on another part of the coast, but having similar\r\ngeological relations, _Fusus Magellanicus_; _Voluta ancilla_; and a\r\n_Balanus_:—these shells are among the commonest now living on this\r\ncoast. Although they must have been lying exposed to the atmospheric\r\nchanges for a very long period, they still partially retain their\r\ndifferent colours. From these facts we know, with certainty, that the\r\nsuperficial deposit, containing the remains of the quadruped, has been\r\n_elevated_ above the sea, within the recent period. From the structure\r\nof the step-like plains, which front the coast, it is certain that each\r\nstep must have been modelled, subsequently to the elevation of the one\r\nstanding above it; and, as the same recent shells occur on two higher\r\nplains, we may, with safety, conclude, that the earthy matter, forming\r\nthe surface of this lower one, together with its embedded skeleton, was\r\n_deposited_ long after the existence of the present species, still\r\ninhabitants of the sea. According, therefore, to the chronology, taken\r\nfrom the duration of species among the molluscs, the fossil quadruped of\r\nPort St. Julian must have been coeval, or nearly so, with those from\r\nBahia Blanca.\r\n\r\nHaving now briefly described the principal circumstances in the geology\r\nof the three districts, to which I at first alluded, I will conclude, by\r\nobserving, that the fossil mammalia of La Plata, Bahia Blanca, and Port\r\nSt. Julian, must all have lived during a very modern period in the\r\ngeological history of the world. It is not the proper place in this work\r\nto enter on any speculations, concerning the cause of the extinction of\r\nso many gigantic animals. I will only here add, that there is the\r\nstrongest evidence against admitting the theory of a period of\r\noverwhelming violence, by which the inhabitants of the land could have\r\nbeen swept away, and destroyed. On the contrary every thing indicates a\r\nformer state of tranquillity, during which various deposits were\r\naccumulating near the then existing coasts, in the same manner, as we\r\nmay suppose others are at this day in progress. The only physical\r\nchange, which we know has taken place, since the existence of these\r\nancient mammalia, has been a small and gradual rising of the continent;\r\nbut it is difficult to believe, that this alone could have so greatly\r\nmodified the climate, as to have been the cause of the utter\r\nextermination of so many animals. Mr. Owen will mention the exact\r\nlocality where the remains of each quadruped were discovered; and, at\r\nthe conclusion, it will be easy to specify by name those, which, from\r\nbeing embedded in the same deposit, are known formerly to have\r\nco-existed on the continent of South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FOSSIL MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n                              BY MR. OWEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be expected that the description of the osseous remains of\r\nextinct Mammalia, which rank amongst the most interesting results of Mr.\r\nDarwin’s researches in South America, should be preceded by some account\r\nof the fossil mammiferous animals which have been previously discovered\r\nin that Continent. The results of such a retrospect are, however,\r\nnecessarily comprised in a very brief statement; for the South American\r\nrelics of extinct Mammalia, hitherto described, are limited, so far as I\r\nknow, to three species of Mastodon, and the gigantic Megatherium.\r\n\r\nOne of the above species of Mastodon (_Mast. Cordillerarum_) was\r\nestablished by Cuvier[1] on remains discovered by Humboldt, in Quito,\r\nnear the volcanic mountain, called _Imbaburra_, at an elevation of 1200\r\ntoises above the level of the sea; and likewise at the Cordilleras of\r\nChiquitos, near Santa Cruz de la Sierra, a locality which is near the\r\ncentre of South America. A second species (_Mastodon Humboldtii_,\r\nCuv.[2]) is indicated by molar teeth, stated to have been discovered by\r\nthe same philosophic traveller, in Chile, near the city of Concepcion.\r\nThe third species of Mastodon appears to have once ranged in vast troops\r\nover the wide empire of Peru: numerous teeth were brought thence to\r\nParis by Dombey,[3] and similar teeth, together with a humerus and tibia\r\nfrom Santa Fé de Bogota were placed by Humboldt at the disposal of\r\nCuvier,[4] who considered them to belong to the _Mastodon angustidens_,\r\na species of which the fossil remains are by no means uncommon in\r\nseveral localities of Europe. Cuvier is also disposed to refer to the\r\nsame species the teeth of the Mastodon from Brazil and Lima, mentioned\r\nby Dr. W. Hunter in his observations on the _animal incognitum_ from the\r\nOhio.[5] The Megatherium has been scientifically described and\r\nillustrated in the works of Bru, Cuvier, and D’Alton, whose accounts are\r\nfounded on a nearly complete skeleton of this stupendous quadruped which\r\nhas existed in the Royal Museum at Madrid for more than half a century.\r\nThe few deficiencies in its osteography have recently been supplied by\r\nthe descriptions and figures given by Dr. Buckland[6] and Mr. Clift,[7]\r\ntaken from remains of the Megatherium, brought by Sir Woodbine Parish\r\nfrom Buenos Ayres, and which were discovered in the bed of the Rio\r\nSalado, a tributary of the Rio Plata. Sir Woodbine Parish’s collection\r\nfrom the same locality, includes also remains of other species of\r\nextinct Edentata, which have not yet been described. M. D’Orbigny, in\r\nhis travels in South America (vol. i. p. 96.), states that, in the banks\r\nof the Parana, he found the fossil remains of a large quadruped, of the\r\nsize of an Ox,—another quadruped of the size of a Cat, apparently of the\r\ncarnivorous order;—and a third, a Rodent as large as a Rat.\r\n\r\nThis meagre condition of the historical part of the subject of South\r\nAmerican fossils by no means arises from their actual scarcity. The\r\nwritings of some of the old Spanish authors, for instance, Torrubia,\r\nGarcillasso, and others,[8] contain frequent allusions to the bones of\r\ngiants, who in times of old dwelt in Peru. Legentil, also, in 1728,\r\nspeaks as an eye-witness of these Peruvian remains; and his guides\r\npointed out to him the traces of the thunder-bolts, by which the Anaks\r\nof the New World had been exterminated. Bones and teeth of the Mastodon\r\nare, according to Humboldt, so abundant in a locality near Santa Fé de\r\nBogota in Columbia, that to this day it bears the name of the “Field of\r\nGiants.”\r\n\r\nBut independently of these indications, the abundance and variety of the\r\nosseous remains of extinct Mammalia in South America are amply attested\r\nby the materials for the following descriptions, collected by one\r\nindividual, whose sphere of observation was limited to a comparatively\r\nsmall part of South America; and the future traveller may fairly hope\r\nfor similar success, if he bring to the search the same zeal and tact\r\nwhich distinguish the gentleman to whom Oryctological Science is\r\nindebted for such novel and valuable accessions.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that all the fossils, collected by Mr. Darwin, belong\r\nto herbivorous species of mammalia, generally of large size. The greater\r\npart are referrible to the order which Cuvier has called Edentata, and\r\nbelong to that subdivision of the order (_Dasypodidæ_) which is\r\ncharacterized by having perfect and sometimes complex molar teeth, and\r\nan external osseous and tesselated coat of mail. The Megatherium is the\r\ngiant of this tribe; which, at the present day, is exclusively\r\nrepresented by South American species, the largest (_Dasypus Gigas_,\r\nCuv.) not exceeding the size of a Hog. The hiatus between this living\r\nspecies and the Megatherium, is filled up by a series of Armadillo-like\r\nanimals, indicated more or less satisfactorily by Mr. Darwin’s fossils,\r\nsome of which species were as large as an Ox, others about the size of\r\nthe American Tapir. The rest of the collection belongs, with the\r\nexception of some small Rodents, to the extensive and heterogeneous\r\norder Pachydermata; it includes the remains of a Mastodon, of a Horse,\r\nand of two large and singular aberrant forms, one of which connects the\r\nPachydermatous with the Ruminant Order; the other, with which the\r\ndescriptions in the following pages commence, manifests a close affinity\r\nto the Rodent Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    A DESCRIPTION OF THE CRANIUM OF\r\n                           TOXODON PLATENSIS;\r\n    _A gigantic extinct mammiferous animal, referrible to the Order\r\n    Pachydermata, but with affinities to the Rodentia, Edentata, and\r\n                         Herbivorous Cetacea_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cranium, which is the subject of the present description, was found\r\nin the Sarandis, a small stream entering the Rio Negro, and about 120\r\nmiles to the N. W. of Monte Video: it had been originally embedded in a\r\nwhitish argillaceous earth, and was discovered lying in the bed of the\r\nrivulet, after a sudden flood had washed down part of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe zoological characters deducible from this cranium, forbid its\r\nassociation, generically, with any known Mammiferous animal, and it must\r\ntherefore be referred to an extinct genus, which I propose to call\r\n_Toxodon_,[9] from the curved or arched form of the teeth, as will\r\nafterwards be described. The specific name, in the absence of other\r\nmeans of knowing the peculiarities of the animal than those afforded by\r\nthe skull, may be most conveniently taken from the district (La Plata),\r\nin which its remains were first discovered.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the cranium of the _Toxodon Platensis_ amply attest\r\nthat the animal to which it belonged was of a magnitude attained by few\r\nterrestrial quadrupeds, and only to be compared, in this respect, with\r\nthe larger Pachyderms, or the extinct Megatherium. The length of the\r\nskull (of which a base view of the natural size is given in Plate I.) is\r\ntwo feet four inches: the extreme breadth one foot four inches. The\r\nother requisite admeasurements are given in the table at the conclusion\r\nof this description.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the skull, as seen from above, is pyriform; but\r\nviewed sideways, and without the lower jaw, it is semi-ovate; it is\r\ndepressed, elongate, of considerable breadth, including the span of the\r\nzygomatic arches, but becoming rather suddenly contracted anterior to\r\nthem, the facial part thence growing narrower to near the muzzle, which\r\nagain slightly expands.\r\n\r\nAmong the first peculiarities which strike the observer, is the aspect\r\nof the plane of the occipital foramen, and of the occipital or posterior\r\nregion of the cranium, the latter of which inclines from below upwards\r\nand forwards at an angle of 50° with the basal line of the skull. This\r\nslope of the back part of the skull is one of the characteristics of the\r\nDinotherium; it is common to all the Cetacea, and is met with in a\r\nslighter degree in many Rodentia, and in the great Ant-eater and some\r\nothers of the Edentate order. The corresponding aspect of the _foramen\r\nmagnum_ presents nearly the opposite extreme to man in the occipital\r\nscale, proposed by Daubenton to determine the diversities of the form of\r\nthe cranium, as a gage of the intelligence of different animals[10]; and\r\nthe indication of the limited capacity of the Toxodon, thus afforded, is\r\nstrengthened by the very small proportion, which the bony walls of the\r\ncerebral cavity bear to the zygomatic and maxillary parts of the skull,\r\nand to the size of the vertebral column, as indicated by the condyloid\r\nprocesses, and foramen magnum.\r\n\r\nThe zygomatic arches are of remarkable size and strength; they commence\r\nimmediately anterior to the sides of the occipital plane, increase in\r\nvertical extent as they pass outwards, forwards and downwards, and are\r\nsuddenly contracted as they bend inwards to abut against the sides of\r\nthe sockets of the two posterior molar teeth.\r\n\r\nThe cranial cavity is remarkably narrow at the space included by the\r\nzygomatic arches; being, as it were, excavated on each side to augment\r\nthe space for the lodgment of the temporal muscles, so that its diameter\r\nat this part is less than that of the anterior extremity of the upper\r\njaw. The upper surface of the cranium expands to form the post-orbital\r\nprocesses, and again contracts anterior to these.\r\n\r\nThe muscular ridges, or other characters, at the top of the skull,\r\ncannot be precisely determined, as a great proportion of the outer table\r\nof the bone is broken away, exposing a coarse and thick diplöe. There\r\nseems, however, to have been a strong ridge separating the occipital\r\nfrom the coronal or upper surface of the cranium. The form of the\r\nremaining parts, which are modified in relation to the attachment of the\r\nmuscles of the jaws, indicates that these were powerfully developed both\r\nfor the offices of mastication and prehension. The general form of the\r\nskull, while it presents certain points of resemblance to that of the\r\naquatic Pachydermata, and even of the Carnivora, has much that is\r\npeculiar to itself; but, in the facial part, it approaches the nearest\r\nto that of the Rodentia; and the dentition of the Toxodon, as exhibited\r\nin the upper jaw, corresponds with that which characterizes the Rodent\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the Toxodon consist of molars and incisors, separated by a\r\nlong diastema, or toothless space. In the upper jaw the molars are\r\n_fourteen_ in number, there being seven on each side; the incisors\r\n_four_, one very large, and one small, in each intermaxillary bone.\r\n\r\nThe general form and nature of the teeth are indicated by the sockets;\r\nand the structure of the grinders is exhibited in a broken molar, the\r\nlast in the series on the left side of the jaw of the present cranium\r\n(See a figure of the grinding surface restored of this tooth, fig. 2,\r\nPl. I.), and by another perfect molar, the last but one on the right\r\nside of the upper jaw, which, though not belonging to the same\r\nindividual as the skull here described, undoubtedly appertains to the\r\nsame species. This latter tooth (Fig. 3, Pl. I.; figs. 2 and 3, Pl. IV.)\r\nwas found by itself, embedded in the banks of the Rio Tercero, or\r\nCarcarana, near the Parana, at the distance of a hundred and eighty\r\nmiles from the locality where the head was discovered. Fragments of a\r\nmolar tooth of a Toxodon, apparently the seventh of the left side, upper\r\njaw, were also found at Bajada de St^a Fé, in the province of Entre\r\nRios, distant forty miles from the mouth of the Rio Tercero.\r\n\r\nAll the molar teeth are long and curved, and without fangs,[11] as in\r\nmost of the herbivorous species of the Rodent Order: in those, however,\r\nwith curved grinders, as the _Aperea_ or Guinea-pig, and _Cavia\r\nPatachonica_, the concavity of the upper grinders is directed outward,\r\nthe fangs of the teeth of the opposite sides diverging as they ascend in\r\nthe sockets; but, in the Toxodon, the convexity of the grinders is\r\noutward, and the fangs converge and almost meet at the middle line of\r\nthe palate, forming a series of arches, capable of overcoming immense\r\nresistance from pressure. (See the upper view of the skull, Plate III.,\r\nin which the fractures expose to view a part of the series of these\r\narched sockets.)\r\n\r\nOf the incisors, the two small ones (the sockets of which are indicated\r\nat _s s_, Pl. III.) are situated in the middle of the front of the upper\r\njaw, close to the suture between the intermaxillaries, and the two large\r\nones in immediate contiguity with the small incisors, which they greatly\r\nexceed in size. The sockets of the two large incisors (_t t_, Pl. III.)\r\nextend backwards, in an arched form, preserving a uniform diameter, as\r\nfar as the commencement of the alveoli of the molar teeth: the curve\r\nwhich they describe is the segment of a circle; the position, form, and\r\nextent of the sockets of these incisors are the same as in those of the\r\ncorresponding teeth of the Rodentia.\r\n\r\nThe matrix, or secreting pulp of the large incisors, was lodged, as in\r\nthe Rodentia, in close proximity with the sockets of the anterior\r\nmolars; and we are enabled to infer, from the form of the incisive\r\nsockets, notwithstanding the absence of the teeth themselves, that the\r\npulp was persistent, and that the growth of these incisors, like those\r\nof the Rodentia, continued throughout life.\r\n\r\nThis condition, joined with the form and curvature of the socket,\r\nimplies a continual wearing away of the crown of the tooth by attrition\r\nagainst opposing incisors of a corresponding structure in the lower jaw:\r\nand as a corollary, it may be inferred that the teeth in question had a\r\npartial coating of enamel, to produce a cutting edge, and were, in fact,\r\ntrue _dentes scalprarii_. The number of incisors in the upper jaw of\r\nToxodon, is not without its parallel in the Rodent Order, the genus\r\n_Lepus_ being characterized by four, instead of two superior incisors,\r\nwhich also present a similar relative size but have a different relative\r\nposition, the small incisors, in the hare and rabbit, being so placed\r\nimmediately behind the large pair, as to receive the appulse of the\r\nsingle pair of incisors in the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nIn the Toxodon the position of the incisors, in the same transverse\r\nline, might lead to the inference, that they were opposed by a\r\ncorresponding number in the lower jaw; but the numerous examples of\r\ninequality, in the number of incisors, in the upper and lower jaws of\r\nexisting mammalia, forbid any conclusion on this point.[12] The sockets\r\nof the small mesial incisors of the Toxodon (_s s_, Pl. III.) gradually\r\ndiminish in size, as they penetrate the intermaxillary bones, and we\r\nmay, therefore, infer that the pulp was gradually absorbed in the\r\nprogress of their development; and that, like ordinary incisors, their\r\ngrowth was of limited duration, and their lodgment in the jaw effected\r\nby a single conical fang.\r\n\r\nI may observe, that the formation of a fang is the necessary consequence\r\nof the gradual absorption of the matrix or pulp of a tooth; for the pulp\r\ncontinues, as it diminishes in size, to deposit ivory upon the inner\r\nsurface of the cavity of the tooth from which it is receding, and the\r\ntooth or fang thus likewise progressively diminishes in size. The\r\nformation of the socket proceeds uninterruptedly, and the bone\r\nencroaching upon the space left by the tooth, closely surrounds the\r\nwasting fang, and affords it a firm support; and thus an inference may\r\nbe drawn from the form of the socket alone, as to whether the tooth it\r\ncontained had or had not one or more conical fangs, and consequently\r\nwhether its growth was temporary or uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nApplying this reasoning to the molar teeth of the Toxodon, we infer that\r\ntheir growth, like those of most of the Phytiphagous Rodents, of the\r\nMegatherium and Armadillo, was perpetual, because their sockets are\r\ncontinued of uniform size from the open to the closed extremity; and the\r\nmolar tooth which is preserved proves the accuracy of the deduction,\r\ninasmuch as its base is excavated by a large conical cavity for the\r\nlodgment of the pulp, the continued activity of which was the\r\ncompensation here designed to meet the effects of attrition on the\r\nopposite or grinding surface of the tooth.\r\n\r\nThe molar tooth discovered by Mr. Darwin in the banks of the Tercero,\r\nnot only belonged to the same species as the skull under consideration,\r\nbut to an individual of the same size; it fits exactly into the socket\r\nnext to the posterior one of the right side. The figures subjoined of\r\nthis molar tooth (Fig. 3, Pl. I.; figs. 2 and 3, Pl. IV.) almost\r\npreclude the necessity of a description. The transverse section of the\r\ntooth gives an irregular, unequal sided, prism; the two broadest sides\r\nof which converge to the anterior angle, which is obtusely rounded. The\r\nouter surface of the tooth (fig. 2, Pl. IV.) is slightly concave in the\r\ntransverse direction, but undulating, from the presence of two slight\r\nconvex risings which traverse the tooth lengthwise. The inner surface\r\npresents at its anterior part a slightly concave surface, and\r\nposteriorly two prominent longitudinal convex ridges, separated by a\r\ngroove which is flat at the bottom, and from the anterior angle of which\r\nthe reflected fold of enamel penetrates the substance of the tooth,\r\nadvancing obliquely forwards, rather more than half-way across the body\r\nof the tooth. A longitudinal ridge of bone projects from the internal\r\nside of the socket, and fits into the groove above mentioned, and as a\r\ncorresponding ridge exists in all the sockets of the grinders, save the\r\ntwo anterior small ones, we may infer that the five posterior grinders\r\non each side, had a similar structure to the tooth above described. The\r\nexternal layer of enamel is uniformly about half a line in thickness; it\r\nis interrupted for the extent of nearly three lines at the anterior\r\nangle, and for more than double that extent at the posterior part of the\r\ntooth, which is consequently worn down much below the level of the rest\r\nof the grinding surface. Where the ivory is thus unprotected by the\r\nenamel, it has a coat of cæmentum, which also fills up the small\r\ninterval at the origin of the reflected fold of enamel. On the grinding\r\nsurface of the entire tooth, and on the fractured ends of the mutilated\r\nmolars, the component fibres, or tubules, of the ivory, are readily\r\nperceptible by the naked eye, diverging from the line which indicates\r\nthe last remains of the cavity of the pulp of the tooth, as it was\r\nprogressively obliterated during growth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the complication of the grinding surface by the inflection of\r\nsimple or straight folds of enamel is peculiarly characteristic of the\r\nRodent type, we must regard the number of molar teeth, and their\r\ndiminution of size as they advance towards the anterior part of the jaw,\r\nin the Toxodon, as indicative of a deviation from that order, and an\r\napproach to the Pachyderms. The common number of grinders in the upper\r\njaw of Rodent animals is eight, four on each side. In some genera, as\r\nLemmus, Mus, Cricetus, there are only three on each side, and in\r\nHydromys and Aulacodus, only two on each side. In Lepus, however, we\r\nfind six on each side of the upper, and five on each side of the lower\r\njaw. The Toxodon, like the Tapir and Hippopotamus, has seven on each\r\nside of the upper jaw: the first in each of these species being the\r\nsmallest. It is worthy of notice, however, that the Capybara which\r\nadheres to the Rodent type in the number of its molars, presents in the\r\nvastly increased size, and additional number of component laminæ of the\r\nposterior grinders, an approximation to the pachydermatous character\r\njust adduced, and the bony palate at the same time presents an expansion\r\nbetween these molars, offering a resemblance to the Toxodon which I have\r\nnot found in any other Rodent besides the Capybara.\r\n\r\nThe most important deviation from the Rodent structure presented by the\r\nteeth, occurs in the direction of the reflected fold of enamel, and such\r\na deviation might have been inferred, even in the absence of the teeth,\r\nfrom the structure of the articular surface, or glenoid cavity for the\r\nreception of the condyle of the lower jaw. As the ridge of enamel runs,\r\nas above described, in a direction approaching that of the longitudinal\r\naxis of the skull, it is obvious that the grinding motions of the lower\r\njaw should be in a proportionate degree in the transverse direction. The\r\nglenoid cavity, therefore, instead of being a longitudinal groove, and\r\nopen behind, as in the true Rodents, is extended transversely, and is\r\ndefended behind by a broad descending bony process preventing the\r\nretraction of the jaw, and showing marks of the forcible pressure to\r\nwhich it was subject.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation that, in the Wombat,—which exhibits the\r\nRodent type of dentition, and, like the Toxodon, has remarkably curved\r\nmolars, but in an opposite direction,—the condyle of the lower jaw is\r\nalso extended transversely, and adapted to an articular surface, which\r\nadmits of lateral motion in the trituration of the food. In the outward\r\nspan of the zygomatic arches, in which Toxodon deviates from the\r\nRodentia, we may trace a relation of subordinacy to the above structure\r\nof the grinding teeth and joint of the lower jaw: the widening of the\r\narches giving to the masseter muscles greater power of drawing the jaw\r\nfrom side to side. The depth of the zygoma bespeaks the magnitude of\r\nthese masticatory muscles, and the included space shews that the\r\ntemporal muscles were also developed to a degree, which indicates the\r\nforce with which the great incisors at the extremity of the jaws, were\r\nused; probably, like the canines of the Hippopotamus, to divide or tear\r\nup by the roots the aquatic plants, growing on the banks of the streams,\r\nwhich the Toxodon may have frequented.\r\n\r\nIn the Rodentia, the zygoma, though sometimes as deep as in the Toxodon,\r\nis generally almost straight, and the space included between it and the\r\ncranium is consequently narrow. The zygoma also is placed more forwards\r\nin all true Rodents, than in the Toxodon; and, instead of abutting\r\nagainst the posterior alveoli, it terminates opposite the anterior ones.\r\nIt thus affords such an attachment to the masseter, that this muscle\r\nextends obliquely backwards to its insertion in the lower jaw, at an\r\nangle which enables it to act with more advantage in drawing forwards\r\nthe lower jaw,—a motion for which the joint is expressly adapted. In\r\nmany Rodents, also, there is a distinct muscle, or portion of the\r\nmasseter, which passes through the ant-orbital foramen, which is on that\r\naccount of large size. In examining the cranium of Toxodon, with\r\nreference to this structure, it was found that the ant-orbital foramen\r\nwas not larger than might have been expected to give transmission to\r\nnerves requisite for supplying with sensibility the large lips, and\r\nwhiskers with which the expanded muzzle of this remarkable quadruped was\r\nprobably furnished.\r\n\r\nHaving thus examined the cranium of the Toxodon in its relation, as a\r\nmechanical instrument, subservient to the function of digestion; we next\r\nproceed to consider the structure and composition of those cavities of\r\nthe skull which gave lodgment and protection to the organs of _special_\r\nsense, and endeavour to deduce from their structure conclusions as to\r\nthe degree in which the organs were developed, and the circumstances\r\nunder which the senses were exercised.\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Toxodon forms the anterior boundary of the zygomatic area;\r\nit is about as distinctly defined as in the Tapir or Dugong, having its\r\nosseous rim less complete than in the Hippopotamus, yet more developed\r\nthan in the Capybara, Coypus, and many other Rodentia, in which the\r\norbit is scarcely distinguishable in the cranium from the small space\r\noccupied by the origin of the temporal muscle.\r\n\r\nThe lower boundary of the orbit in Toxodon is formed by an excavation in\r\nthe upper and anterior part of the zygoma; the upper boundary by a\r\nstrong and rugged overarching process of the frontal bone, the posterior\r\nangle of which (_a_, Pl. III.) descends a little way, but leaves a space\r\nof three inches and a half between it and the opposite angle of the\r\nmalar bone below (_b_, Pl. II. and III.), the circumference of the orbit\r\nbeing completed probably by ligament in the recent subject. The cavity\r\nthus circumscribed is remarkable for the preponderance of the vertical\r\nover the transverse or longitudinal diameter, and indicates great extent\r\nof motion of the eyeball in the vertical direction, such as may be\r\nsupposed to be well adapted to the exigencies of an amphibious\r\nquadruped. The orbit of the Capybara, or Water-hog, makes a near\r\napproach to the form just described. In the elevation of the\r\nsupra-orbital boundary, and its outward projection in the Toxodon, we\r\nperceive an approximation to the form of the orbit in the Hippopotamus,\r\nbut the size of the orbit is relatively larger in the Toxodon, which in\r\nthis respect manifests its affinity to the Rodentia.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the bony structure of the auditory apparatus, which is\r\nvisible on the exterior of the cranium, the skull of the Toxodon\r\npresents a character in which it recedes from the Rodentia. In these,\r\nthe tympanic portion of the temporal bone is remarkably developed,\r\nforming a large bulla ossea between the glenoid cavity and the occiput;\r\nand it always remains disunited to the other elements of the temporal\r\nbone. In the Toxodon the tympanic bone (_c_, Pl. II.) consists of a\r\nrough compressed vertical osseous plate, wedged in transversely between\r\nthe occiput and the posterior part of the glenoid cavity. The internal\r\nextremity of this plate points inwards and forwards, representing the\r\nstyloid process; behind this is seen the petrous bone, which forms a\r\nsmall angular protuberance at the basis cranii, and is less developed\r\nthan in the Hippopotamus. Anterior to the petrous bone are the orifices\r\nof the Eustachian tube, and carotid canal; external to it is the great\r\nforamen lacerum, for the jugular vein and nervus vagus; and behind it is\r\nthe anterior condyloid foramen. The foramen auditorium externum is only\r\nhalf an inch in diameter, and gives passage to a long and somewhat\r\ntortuous meatus, which passes inwards and slightly forwards and\r\ndownwards; its direction being precisely the same as in the\r\nHippopotamus; it was accompanied, probably, by as small an external\r\nauricle.\r\n\r\nBut the indications of the aquatic habits of the Toxodon, which are\r\npresented by the osseous parts relating to the senses of sight and\r\nhearing, are of minor import compared with those afforded by the bony\r\nboundary of the nostrils. This boundary circumscribes a large ovate\r\naperture, the aspect of whose plane is upwards, and a little forwards,\r\nas in the Herbivorous Cetaceans, and especially the Manatee (_Trichecus\r\nManatus_, Cuv.) In one part of the bony structure of the nasal cavity\r\nthe Toxodon deviates, however, in a marked degree from the Cetaceous\r\nstructure; I allude to the frontal sinuses, which are exposed by the\r\nfracture of the upper part of the skull. (They are shewn in Plate III.,\r\nand an asterisk is placed on one of the narrow canals of\r\nintercommunication between the sinuses and the nasal passages.) The\r\nposterior orifice of the nasal cavity is relatively larger and wider\r\nthan in the Herbivorous Cetaceans, and differs both in form and aspect\r\nin consequence of the greater extent of the bony palate. The Toxodon\r\nfurther differs from the Manatee and Dugong, in the firm nature of the\r\nconnexion of the bones of the head; and it differs from the Hippopotamus\r\nin the strong attachment of the intermaxillary bones to the maxillaries.\r\n\r\nThere next remain to be described, as far as the shattered condition of\r\nthe skull will permit, the relative position, extent, and connexions of\r\nthe principal bones composing it.\r\n\r\nThe _occipital bone_ exhibits a complete confluence of its basilar,\r\ncondyloid, and supra-occipital elements. The basilar portion, in\r\nconnexion with the corresponding element of the sphenoid bone, describes\r\na curve whose convexity is downwards. The condyles are large, extended\r\nin the transverse direction, completely terminal, and a little inclined\r\ndownwards below the level of the basilar process. The curve of the\r\narticulating surface describes, in the vertical direction, two-thirds of\r\na circle, indicating that the head must have possessed considerable\r\nextent of motion upwards and downwards upon the atlas; thus, while the\r\nbody of the Toxodon was submerged, the head probably could be raised so\r\nas to form an angle with the neck, and bring the snout to the surface of\r\nthe water without the necessity of any corresponding inflection of the\r\nspine. Indeed, in the form and position of the condyles, the Toxodon\r\nmore nearly resembles the true Cetacea than any other existing mammalia;\r\nand it is only with these that it can be compared in regard to the\r\naspect of the plane of the occipital foramen, and of the occipital\r\nregion of the skull. This is inclined forwards from the occipital\r\nforamen at such an angle, that on viewing the skull from above, not only\r\nthe condyles, but the entire circumference of the occipital foramen are\r\nvisible. (See Pl. III.) The upper part of the supra-occipital plate\r\npresents a broad rugous depression, indicative of the insertion of\r\nstrong cervical muscles, and probably of a _ligamentum Nuchæ_.[13]\r\n\r\nThe ex-occipital processes advance forwards for about an inch beyond the\r\ncondyles, and then suddenly extend outwards at right angles to the\r\nformer line, and terminate in the form of vertically compressed bony\r\nplates; the lower rugged margins of which represent or perform the\r\noffice of the mastoid processes (_d_, _d_, Pls. II. and III.). The\r\nbreadth of the entire occipital region of the skull (fig. 1, Pl. IV.)\r\nappears to have been, allowing for the fractures, about one-third more\r\nthan the height of the same part.\r\n\r\nThe great development of the _tympanic_ bones in the Rodentia, occasions\r\nthe intervention of a considerable space between the occipital bone and\r\nthe zygomatic process of the temporal; but in the great Toxodon, in\r\nwhich the sense of hearing was doubtless inferior to that enjoyed by the\r\nsmall and timorous Rodents, the tympanic bone is reduced to a thin\r\nplate, which is wedged in between the occiput and glenoid cavity. In\r\nthis structure, and the consequent posterior position of the glenoid\r\ncavity, there is a close resemblance between the Toxodon and the\r\nHippopotamus, Tapir, and Rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThe _squamous_ element of the temporal bone (N, Pl. II.) forms a small\r\nproportion of the lateral walls of the cranium, and also enters into the\r\ncomposition of the lateral and superior parts of the posterior region of\r\nthe cranium, where two deep fossæ perforated by large vascular foramina,\r\nindicate the junction of the squamous bones with the supra-occipital\r\nbone. The posterior surface of the skull is thus divided into three\r\nbroad and shallow depressions, the two lateral facets being slightly\r\nover-lapped by the middle one, at their junction with it. In this\r\nstructure the Toxodon resembles the Hippopotamus, and differs\r\nconsiderably from the Cetacea, in which the occipital region is rendered\r\nconvex by the extraordinary development of the brain within.\r\n\r\nThe _zygomatic_ process of the temporal bone projects boldly outwards at\r\nits commencement, where it is of great strength, and three-sided; the\r\nglenoid cavity extends transversely across the base or inferior surface\r\nof this part; the lateral surfaces converge to form the ridge or upper\r\nboundary of the zygoma. The depth of the glenoid cavity is increased by\r\na transverse production of bone both before and behind it: the posterior\r\nprocess (_g_, Pl. II.) descends the lowest, and affords the requisite\r\ndefence against backward dislocation of the lower jaw; the pressure of\r\nthe condyle against this process is denoted by a well defined,\r\ntransversely-ovate, flattened and smooth surface, as if the bone had\r\nbeen planed down at that part: the anterior transverse boundary is\r\nconvex and smooth, and probably formed part of the articulation for the\r\nlower jaw. The lower facet of the zygoma anterior to the glenoid cavity\r\ngradually contracts in breadth, as it advances forward, and at the\r\ndistance of three inches from the articular cavity the zygoma changes\r\nfrom a prismatic to a laminar form. It is at this point that the\r\nzygomatic suture commences, at the lower margin of the arch; whence it\r\nextends directly forwards for more than half its length, and then bends\r\nupwards at a right angle. The zygomatic suture has a similar course in\r\nthe Capybara, and Hippopotamus.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the zygoma is formed externally by the _malar_ bone (G\r\nPl. II.), which in its position is intermediate to the Rodent and\r\nPachydermatous structures. It is not suspended in the middle of the\r\nzygomatic arch, as in the former order; neither does it extend into the\r\nregion of the face so far anterior to the orbit as in the Tapir or\r\nHippopotamus. The exterior line of the malo-maxillary suture defines the\r\norbit anteriorly; but from this line the maxillary bone extends\r\nbackwards, along the inner side of the malar portion of the zygoma,\r\nuntil it almost reaches the temporo-malar suture; thus abutting by an\r\noblique surface against nearly the whole internal facet of the malar\r\nbone, and materially contributing to the general strength of the\r\nzygomatic arch. The malar bone is of considerable vertical extent, and\r\npresents a rugged and thickened inferior margin for the attachment of\r\nthe masseter. The upper margin of the malar bone is smoothly rounded,\r\nand presents a regular semicircular excavation, forming the lower\r\nboundary of the orbit. The relative magnitude of the zygomata to the\r\nentire cranium far exceeds in the Toxodon that which exists in the\r\nHippopotamus or any other known Pachyderm. This arises from the great\r\nvertical development of the malar bone behind the orbit, and the\r\nvertical expansion of the temporal portion of the arch. The oblique\r\nposition of the zygoma, descending as it advances forwards, is deserving\r\nof attention, as the Toxodon, in deviating from the Pachyderms in these\r\nrespects, makes an evident approach to the herbivorous Cetaceans, as the\r\nDugong and Manatee: in the latter Cetacean we observe a similar\r\ndevelopment of the lower part of the zygomatic process of the malar\r\nbone. It is here, also, that we may perceive an indication of a\r\nresemblance between the Megatherium and Toxodon.\r\n\r\nThere is no discernible trace of the _lachrymal_ bone (E, Pl. II.)\r\nhaving extended, as in the Hippopotamus beyond the anterior boundary of\r\nthe orbit: the lachrymal foramen is situated rather deep in the orbit,\r\nand the bone itself appears to have been of very small size.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the supra-orbital process of the _frontal_ bone(C, Pl.\r\nII.) is deserving of attention, as it presents a peculiar ruggedness\r\nwhich is not found in any other part of the skull; the irregularity\r\nseems, as it were, to have been produced by the impression of numerous\r\nsmall tortuous and anastomosing vessels. In the skull of a Sumatran\r\ntwo-horned Rhinoceros, in the Museum of the College of Surgeons (No.\r\n816), the circumference of that part of the surface of the skull which\r\nsupported the posterior horn, and which includes precisely the same part\r\nof the os frontis, presents the same character, the surface being broken\r\nby numerous vascular impressions. On the supposition that this character\r\nof the supra-orbitary arch in the Toxodon might indicate the\r\nsuperincumbency of a bony case, I examined the skulls of two Armadillos,\r\n_Dasypus Peba_ and _Das. 6–cinctus_, and found that in the Dasypus\r\n6–cinctus, the supra-orbital ridges, which are slightly elevated, to\r\nsupport the cephalic plate, presented, in a minor degree, a\r\ncorresponding rugosity. May we venture then to conjecture that the\r\nToxodon was defended by an ossified integument like the Armadillo, or\r\nthat it was armed with an epidermic production, analogous to the horn of\r\nthe Rhinoceros; or had the rugous surface in question as little relation\r\nwith the parts that covered it as the sculptured surface of the malar\r\nbones in the Cavy?\r\n\r\nAfter forming the rugged and prominent supra-orbital processes already\r\ndescribed, the frontal bone continues to send backwards a slightly\r\nelevated ridge or _crista_, circumscribing the origin of the temporal\r\nmuscles, but the extent of this ridge, and the disposition of the\r\ninter-orbital portion of the frontal bones cannot be determined in the\r\npresent mutilated specimen. The fractures it has sustained are not,\r\nhowever, wholly unattended with advantage; they expose the structure of\r\nthe diploë, which from its coarseness of texture and thickness,\r\nresembles that of the Cetaceous crania; and what is of still more\r\nimportance, they also demonstrate the existence and form of the frontal\r\nsinuses.\r\n\r\nThe cavity of the nose is extensive, and the remains of the ossa\r\nspongiosa superiora testify that the Toxodon enjoyed the sense of smell\r\nto a degree equal at least to that of the Hippopotamus.\r\n\r\nThe _sphenoid bone_ resembles that of the Hippopotamus, but it\r\ncontributes a larger share to the formation of the internal pterygoid\r\nprocesses (_p_, Pl. II.); these are of a simple form, and more developed\r\nthan in the _Hippopotamus_; they project outwards to a greater extent,\r\nand terminate in a point. The sphenoid also sends off a short and thick\r\npointed process from the posterior part of the base of the internal\r\npterygoid processes. The ala of the sphenoid does not rise so far into\r\nthe orbit, nor does it articulate with the parietal bone, as in the\r\nHippopotamus; but in this part of its structure, is the same as in the\r\nRhinoceros. The spheno-palatine foramen is relatively larger than in the\r\nabove-named Pachyderms, and is bounded above by the descending orbital\r\nplate of the frontal bone.\r\n\r\nThe palatal processes of the _palatine_ bones terminate anteriorly\r\nbetween the last molars, and extend backwards for some distance beyond\r\nthe alveolar processes, increasing the extent of the bony roof of the\r\nmouth posteriorly: this is a structure in which the Toxodon deviates\r\nboth from the Rodents, and Pachyderms, and resembles the Armadillos\r\namong the Edentata; excepting that the postdental part of the bony\r\npalate in the Toxodon is suddenly contracted in breadth. The\r\npalato-maxillary suture is in the form of a chevron, with the angle\r\ndirected forwards, as in the Hippopotamus and Capybara, but truncated.\r\n\r\nThe _superior maxillary_ bones (F, Pl. II.) are united posteriorly to\r\nthe malar, as above described: they ascend and join the frontal and\r\nnasal bones: their outer surface is almost vertical, smooth, and\r\nslightly undulating; perforated at its posterior part by the ant-orbital\r\nforamen, and joined anteriorly to the intermaxillaries by a suture\r\nrunning in the sigmoid direction (as shewn in Pl. II.) from the middle\r\nof the nasal cavity, to within four inches of the anterior boundary of\r\nthe upper jaw. We have, in the position and extent of this suture, and\r\nthe absence of tusks and their large prominent sockets, a most important\r\ndifference between the Toxodon and Hippopotamus. The chief peculiarity\r\nin the maxillary bones, obtains in the arched form of the alveolar\r\nprocesses, corresponding to the shape and position of the grinders above\r\ndescribed, and which are peculiar among known mammalia to the present\r\ngenus. The palatal surface of the maxillary bones is obliquely\r\nperforated by two large foramina, from which two deep longitudinal\r\ngrooves extend forwards, and are gradually lost; we find the posterior\r\npalatine foramina represented by similar grooves and foramina in the\r\nCapybara.\r\n\r\nThe _intermaxillary_ bones (D, Pls. II. and III.), though large, are\r\nrelatively of less extent than in the Rodents generally. The nasal\r\nprocesses do not reach the frontal bone, but are limited to the anterior\r\nhalf of the nasal boundary; approaching in this respect to the\r\nHerbivorous Cetacea. In the outward expansion of their anterior\r\nextremities, the intermaxillaries resemble those of the Hippopotamus, in\r\nwhich, however, this character is more strongly marked. The\r\nintermaxillaries in the Hippopotamus are also much less firmly united to\r\nthe maxillary bones than in the Toxodon, and are consequently commonly\r\nlost in the fossil crania. On the palatal surface of the intermaxillary\r\nbones there are two grooves which diverge forwards from the line of the\r\nsuture; and anteriorly to these grooves there are the two large anterior\r\npalatine foramina. The maxillo-intermaxillary sutures on the palate\r\nconverge as they extend backwards to a point; there appears to have been\r\na fissure left between this suture and the mesial suture of the\r\nintermaxillaries; in which structure the Toxodon resembles the\r\nHippopotamus.\r\n\r\nAfter summing up the different affinities, or indications of affinity,\r\nwhich are deducible from the cranium of this most curious and\r\ninteresting fossil mammal, we are led to the conclusion, assuming it to\r\nhave had extremities cased in hoofs, that it is referrible to the Order\r\nPachydermata. But the structure, form, and kind of teeth in the upper\r\njaw, prove, indisputably, that the gigantic Toxodon was intimately\r\nrelated to the Rodent Order. From the characters of this order, as\r\nafforded by the existing species, the Toxodon, however, differs in the\r\nrelative position of the supernumerary incisors, and in the number, and\r\ndirection of the curvature, of the molars. If, moreover, the lower jaw,\r\nnext to be described, belong, as I believe, to the Toxodon, the dental\r\ncharacter of the genus will be _incisors_ ⁴⁄₆; _pro laniariis diastema_;\r\n_molares_ ⁷⁄₇ ⁷⁄₇.\r\n\r\nThe Toxodon again deviates from the true Rodentia, and resembles the\r\nWombat, and the Pachyderms, in the transverse direction of the articular\r\ncavity of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nIt deviates from the Rodentia, and resembles the Pachydermata in the\r\nrelative position of the glenoid cavities and zygomatic arches, and in\r\nmany minor details already alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn the aspect of the plane of the occipital foramen, and occipital\r\nregion of the skull; in the form and position of the occipital condyles;\r\nin the aspect of the plane of the anterior bony aperture of the\r\nnostrils; and in the thickness and texture of the osseous parietes of\r\nthe skull, the Toxodon deviates both from the Rodentia and existing\r\nPachydermata, and manifests an affinity to the Dinotherium and Cetaceous\r\nOrder, especially the Herbivorous section.\r\n\r\nAt present we possess no evidence to determine whether the extremities\r\nof the Toxodon were organized on the ungulate or unguiculate type, nor\r\ncan we be positive, from the characters which the skull affords, that\r\nthe genus may not be referrible to the _Mutica_ of Linnæus;[14] although\r\nthe development of the nasal cavity and the presence of large frontal\r\nsinuses render it extremely improbable that the habits of this species\r\nwere so strictly aquatic, as the total absence of hinder extremities\r\nwould occasion.\r\n\r\nWhere the dentition of a mammiferous animal is strictly carnivorous,\r\nthis structure is obviously incompatible with a foot incased in a\r\nhoof:—but where the teeth are adapted for triturating vegetable\r\nsubstances the case is different. If animals so characterized are of\r\nsmall size and seek their food in trees, or if they burrow for roots or\r\nfor shelter, the vegetable type of dentition must co-exist with\r\nunguiculate extremities, as in the Edentata and Rodentia generally: but\r\nthe largest genus (Hydrochærus) of the Rodent Order, whose affinity to\r\nthe Pachydermata is manifested in its heavy shapeless trunk, thinly\r\nscattered bristly hair, and many other particulars, has each of its toes\r\ninclosed in a miniature hoof.\r\n\r\nThe affinity above alluded to, is too obvious to have escaped popular\r\nnotice, and the Capybara, from its aquatic habits, has obtained the name\r\nof Water-hog. It is highly interesting to find that the continent to\r\nwhich this existing aberrant form of Rodent is peculiar, should be found\r\nto contain the remains of an extinct genus, characterized by a dentition\r\nwhich closely resembles the Rodent type, but manifesting it on a\r\ngigantic scale, and tending to complete the chain of affinities which\r\nlinks the Pachydermatous with the Rodent and Cetaceous Orders.\r\n\r\n            ADMEASUREMENTS OF THE CRANIUM OF TOXODON.            feet inches lines\r\n Extreme length                                                     2      4\r\n Extreme breadth                                                    1      4\r\n Extreme height, (exclusive of the lower jaw)                             10\r\n Length of zygomatic process                                        1      1     6\r\n Depth or vertical extent of do.                                           6\r\n Transverse extent of zygomatic fossa                                      6\r\n Transverse diameter of cranium between the zygomatic arches               5\r\n Transverse diameter of occipital plane of the cranium              1\r\n From the outside of one condyle to that of the opposite condyle           8     6\r\n Length of the bony palate                                          1      6\r\n Extreme breadth of ditto                                                  6\r\n Breadth of palate at the intermaxillary suture                            2     6\r\n Breadth of palate behind the molar alveoli                                3\r\n Longitudinal extent of the molar alveoli                                  9     6\r\n Longitudinal extent of the diastema                                       5     6\r\n Transverse diameter of posterior nasal aperture                           3     9\r\n Transverse diameter of occipital foramen                                  3\r\n Transverse diameter of glenoid cavity                                     4     6\r\n Antero-posterior do. of ditto                                             1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DESCRIPTION OF FRAGMENTS OF A LOWER JAW AND TEETH OF A TOXODON.\r\n\r\n   Found at Bahia Blanca, in latitude 39° on the East coast of South\r\n                                America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn looking over some fragments of jaws and teeth, forming part of Mr.\r\nDarwin’s collection of South American mammiferous remains, and which had\r\nbeen set aside with mutilated specimens referrible to species belonging\r\nto the family of Edentata, my attention was caught by the appearance of\r\nroots of teeth projecting, in a different direction from the grinders,\r\nfrom the fractured anterior extremity of a lower jaw, and I was induced\r\nto examine minutely the structure of the teeth in this specimen, and to\r\nsearch the collection for corresponding fragments. The result was the\r\ndiscovery of portions of the two rami, and the commencement of the\r\nsymphysis of a lower jaw, containing anteriorly the roots of six\r\nincisors, and at least six molars on each side; but as the rami had been\r\nfractured through the middle of the sixth alveolus, the number of\r\ngrinders may have corresponded with those in the upper jaw of the\r\nToxodon.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect of these fragments is figured in Pl. V. figures 1 and\r\n4; figure 2 shows the form of the teeth in transverse section, and the\r\ndisposition of the enamel upon the grinding surface of the molars on the\r\nright side, as restored from a comparison of the fractured teeth in the\r\ntwo rami. From the remains of the symphysis shown at fig. 4, it will be\r\nseen that the jaw was remarkably compressed, or narrow from side to\r\nside; while the rami (fig. 1.) were of considerable depth, in order to\r\ngive lodgment to the matrices and bases of grinders enjoying\r\nuninterrupted growth.\r\n\r\nThe pulps of the six incisors in this lower jaw are arranged in a pretty\r\nregular semicircle, whose convexity is downwards; the teeth themselves\r\nare directed forwards, and curved upwards, like the inferior incisors of\r\nthe Rodentia. The form and degree of the curvature are shown in the\r\nalmost perfect incisor (Pl. V. fig. 5) which corresponds with the left\r\ninferior incisor of the lower jaw, and was found in the same stratum,\r\nbut belonged to another individual.\r\n\r\nThese incisors are nearly equal in size: they are all hollow at their\r\nbase, and the indurated mineral substance impacted in their basal\r\ncavities well exhibits the form of the vascular pulps which formerly\r\noccupied them. Sufficient of the tooth itself remains in four of the\r\nsockets to show that these incisors, like the nearly perfect one (fig.\r\n5), had only a partial investment of enamel; but though in this respect,\r\nas well as in their curvature and perpetual growth, they resemble the\r\ndentes scalprarii of the Rodentia, they differ in having a prismatic\r\nfigure, like the inferior incisors of the Sumatran Rhinoceros, or the\r\ntusks of the Boar. Two of the sides, viz., those forming the anterior\r\nconvex and mesial surfaces of the incisor have a coating of enamel,\r\nabout half a line in thickness, which terminates at the angles between\r\nthese and the posterior or concave surface. In plate V. fig. 4, the\r\nenamel of the broken incisors is represented by short lines, showing the\r\ndirection of its crystalline fibres; the white space immediately within\r\nthe enamel shows the thickness of the ivory at the base of the tooth,\r\nthe included gray substance represents a section of the formative matrix\r\nor pulp of the tooth, which was of the usual conical form: the inferior\r\nbroken end of the incisor (fig. 5,) appears to have been distant about\r\none-third from the apex of the pulp.\r\n\r\nFrom the relative position of the bases or roots of these incisors, we\r\nmay infer that they diverged from each other as they advanced forwards,\r\nin order to bring their broadest cutting surfaces into line. That they\r\nwere opposed to teeth of a corresponding structure in the upper jaw is\r\nproved by the oblique chisel-like cutting surface of the more perfect\r\nincisor: and it is not without interest to find that the presence of\r\n_dentes scalprarii_ at the anterior part of the mouth has not been\r\nnecessarily limited to Mammalia of small size.\r\n\r\nThe position of the pulps of these incisors, in close proximity with the\r\nanterior grinders, corresponds with the position of the pulps of the\r\nincisors in the upper jaw of the _Toxodon_, and indicates, in\r\nconjunction with the size of the pulps, that a considerable extent of\r\nthe inferior incisors was lodged in the substance of the anterior part\r\nof the jaw. It is most likely that no vertically directed tooth would be\r\ndeveloped in the part of the jaw so occupied by the curved bases of the\r\nincisors, and hence a diastema or toothless space would intervene\r\nbetween the molars and incisors of this lower jaw, as in the upper jaw\r\nof the Toxodon.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, also, to observe, that as the deviations from the\r\nRodent type, which occur in the cranium of the Toxodon, are the same, in\r\nsome instances, as those which obtain in the Wombat; so we find a\r\ncorresponding deviation in the size and relative position of the\r\ninferior incisors, which, as in the Wombat, terminate anterior to the\r\nmolar teeth, instead of extending backwards beyond the last grinder, as\r\nin most of the true Rodents. The Capybara presents the nearest approach\r\nto this structure, the pulps of the inferior incisors being situated\r\nopposite the interspace of the first and second grinders.\r\n\r\nThe molar teeth, in this mutilated lower jaw, like those in the upper\r\njaw of Toxodon, had persistent pulps, as is proved by the conical cavity\r\nat their base, as represented in fig. 3; they consequently required a\r\ndeep socket, and a corresponding depth of jaw to form the socket and\r\nprotect the pulps. In order to economise space, and to increase the\r\npower of resistance in the tooth, and perhaps, also, to diminish the\r\neffects of direct pressure on the highly vascular and sensible matrix,\r\nwe find the molars and their sockets are curved, but in a less degree\r\nthan those of the upper jaw of the Toxodon. They correspond, however,\r\nwith the superior molars of the Toxodon in the antero-posterior\r\ndiameter, in being small and simple at the anterior part of the jaw, and\r\nby increasing in magnitude and complexity as they are situated more\r\nposteriorly. They are, however, narrower from side to side; but\r\nsupposing them to belong to the Toxodon, it would agree in this respect\r\nwith most other large herbivorous mammalia;—the fixed surface for\r\nattrition in the upper jaw being from obvious principles more extensive\r\nthan the opposed moveable surface in the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ grinder, in the lower jaw here described (Pl. V. fig. 2), is\r\nof small size and simple structure, being surrounded with a coating of\r\nenamel of uniform thickness, and without any fold penetrating the\r\nsubstance of the tooth. It is more curved than any of the other molars,\r\nand appears to have differed from the external incisor only in its\r\nentire coating of enamel and direction of growth; it is interesting,\r\nindeed, to find so gradual a transition, in structure, from molar to\r\nincisive teeth, as this jaw presents; for the robust incisors may here\r\nbe regarded as representing molars simplified by the partial loss of\r\nenamel, and with a change in their direction.\r\n\r\nIn the _second_ molar, we find an increase in the antero-posterior\r\ndiameter, and in the length of the tooth, and the enamel at the middle\r\nof the outer side makes a fold which penetrates a little way into the\r\ntooth; the line of enamel, on the inner side, is slightly concave and\r\nunbroken.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ molar presents an increase of dimensions in the same\r\ndirections as the second; the enamel on the outer side of the tooth\r\npresents a similar fold, but it is directed a little more backwards.\r\n\r\nIn the _fourth_ molar, besides a further increase of size, and a\r\ncorresponding but deeper fold of enamel in the external side of the\r\ntooth, we have the grinding surface rendered more complicated by two\r\nfolds of enamel entering the substance of the tooth from the inner side:\r\nthese folds divide the antero-posterior extent of the tooth into three\r\nnearly equal parts; they are both directed obliquely forwards, half-way\r\nacross the substance of the ivory.\r\n\r\nThe _fifth_ molar presents the same structure as the fourth, which it\r\nexceeds only slightly in size.\r\n\r\nIn the _sixth_ molar we have a proportionally greater increase of size\r\nin the antero-posterior diameter, which measures two inches; but the\r\nlateral diameter is but slightly augmented; its structure resembles that\r\nof the fifth.\r\n\r\nAs these grinding teeth by no means increase in the lateral diameter in\r\nthe same proportion as in their antero-posterior diameter, the posterior\r\nones present, but in a greater degree, the compressed form which\r\ncharacterizes the grinders of the upper jaw of the Toxodon.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, however, that there is a difference in the structure of\r\nthe grinders in this fragment of the lower jaw and those of the upper\r\njaw of the Toxodon. In the lower grinders there are two folds of enamel\r\nproceeding from the inner side of the tooth into its substance, whilst\r\nin the upper grinders there is only one fold continued from the inner\r\nside; in the lower grinders there is also a fold of enamel reflected\r\ninto the substance of the tooth from the outer surface, while in the\r\nupper grinders of Toxodon we find the enamel coating on the outer side\r\nof the tooth merely bent inwards, so as to describe, in the transverse\r\nsection, a gently undulating line; fig. 7, Pl. V. is the grinding\r\nsurface of the sixth molar, right side, upper jaw.\r\n\r\nBut this difference of structure is by no means incompatible with the\r\nco-existence of the two series of teeth in the same animal, since we\r\nfind the grinders of the upper and lower jaws presenting differences of\r\nstructure of equal degree in existing herbivorous species. If we examine\r\nthe jaws of the Horse, for example, we shall find not only an equal\r\namount of difference in the structure of the upper and lower grinders,\r\nbut that they deviate from one another in a very similar manner to that\r\nabove described in the Toxodon. In this comparison attention should be\r\nconfined to the course of the external enveloping layer of enamel,\r\nleaving out of consideration the central crescentic islands of enamel\r\nwhich constitute the additional complexity of the Horse’s grinder.\r\nViewing then the course of the external coat of enamel on the worn\r\nsurface of the tooth, we find it describing on the outer side of the\r\ntooth in the upper jaw an undulating line,—a middle convexity being\r\nsituated between two concavities; on the inner side of the tooth one\r\nfold of enamel penetrates to the middle of the tooth, and on each side\r\nof this there is a smaller fold. But in the lower jaw the line of enamel\r\non the outer side of the tooth, instead of merely bending outwards\r\nmidway in its course, is reflected a little way inwards; while on the\r\nopposite, or inner side of the tooth, the enamel sends two extensive\r\nfolds into the substance of the tooth, opposite to the interspace of\r\nwhich the shorter fold projects from the outer side. Now, on the\r\nsupposition that the fragment of the lower jaw here described belongs to\r\nthe Toxodon, the kind and degree of difference in the complexity of the\r\ngrinding surface of the teeth in the upper and lower jaw, are remarkably\r\nanalogous to those which exist in the Horse. I have only further to\r\nremark that in the Horse the inflected folds of enamel, instead of being\r\nsimple and straight with the two constitutive layers in apposition, as\r\nin the Toxodon, are irregular in their course, with cœmentum intervening\r\nbetween the constitutive layers, which also diverge from each other at\r\ntheir angle of reflection, so as to augment the amount of dense material\r\nwhich enters into the composition of the tooth.\r\n\r\nMany analogous examples will readily occur to the experienced\r\ncomparative anatomist. The Horse has been adduced as one to which\r\nreference can very readily be made; but I would also cite the Sumatran\r\nRhinoceros, the skull of which, in the Hunterian collection, has already\r\nbeen alluded to. In this species the anterior grinders, in both jaws,\r\nare small and simple, and increase in complexity as they recede\r\nbackwards. The third superior grinder (fig. 8, Pl. V.) presents a single\r\nfold of enamel, reflected obliquely forwards from the inner side\r\nhalf-way across the tooth; the outer line of enamel describes a simply\r\nundulating line. The opposite grinder of the lower jaw (fig. 9, Pl. V.)\r\nhas only one-half the breadth of the upper one, but has its grinding\r\nsurface further complicated by having two inflected folds of enamel from\r\nthe inner side, and one shorter and broader fold from the outer side.\r\nThis tooth, therefore, presents a close resemblance to one of the\r\nposterior grinders of the lower jaw of the Toxodon, but differs\r\nessentially in being of limited growth, and consequently in having\r\nfangs.[15]\r\n\r\nIn speculating upon the nature of the organized substances which the\r\nteeth of the Toxodon were destined to grind down, we must not only take\r\nthe structure of the tooth into consideration, but also the power of\r\nperpetual renovation, which will compensate for the defective quantity\r\nof enamel in the grinders of the Toxodon, as compared with those of the\r\nexisting Ruminants and Pachyderms, whose grinders, when once completed,\r\nreceive no further addition of dental substance at their base. The\r\nToxodon, in this character of its dentition, participated in the same\r\nadvantages with the Capybara and the Megatherium.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have been enabled to observe the structure of the grinding\r\nteeth of the upper jaw of the Toxodon in two examples only; one, an\r\ninsulated perfect grinder corresponding to the sixth alveolus on the\r\nright side, and the other, a portion of the last grinder of the left\r\nside remaining in the socket of the head previously described, yet from\r\nthe relations subsisting between socket and tooth, a very satisfactory\r\nopinion may be formed of the structure of those teeth which are wanting,\r\nas well as of their size. It thus appears, that the grinders of the\r\nupper jaw of the Toxodon, are small and simple at the anterior part of\r\nthe jaw, and that they increase (chiefly in antero-posterior extent) in\r\nsize, as well as in complexity, as they recede backwards in the jaw. In\r\nthis respect, as well as in size, the teeth, in the fragments of the\r\nlower jaw just described, exactly correspond. There is, however, a\r\nslight difference in the lateral diameter of the two sets of grinders,\r\nthose of the lower jaw being narrower, as is usually the case, but not\r\nin the same degree as in the Horse or Ruminant. A greater difference\r\nobtains in the degree of curvature of the two sets of molars, those of\r\nthe lower jaw, especially the posterior grinders, being much less bent\r\nthan the corresponding teeth of the upper jaw. It is necessary to\r\nobserve, also, that the convexity of the curve of the inferior grinders\r\nis directed outwards, as in the superior grinders; while in the Guinea\r\nPig and Wombat, which have also curved grinders, the convexity is\r\noutwards in the lower jaw, and inwards in the upper jaw.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if we take into consideration the close similarity which\r\nexists between the teeth of the upper jaw of the Toxodon, and those of\r\nthis lower jaw in more essential points, as in their persistent pulps,\r\ntheir characteristic structure and form, the depth of their sockets, and\r\ntheir relative sizes and complexity; and when we consider how the depth\r\nof this lower jaw, and its narrowness in the transverse direction,\r\ncorresponds with the characteristic form of the upper jaw of the\r\nToxodon, and that to these resemblances is added an apparatus of\r\nincisors adequate to oppose the great dentes scalprarii of the upper\r\njaw, the conclusion seems irresistible, that the lower jaw, here\r\ndescribed, must be referred, if not to the same, at least to a nearly\r\nallied species of Toxodon, as that to which the large cranium belonged.\r\n\r\nFurther researches in South America, it is hoped, will lead, ere long,\r\nto the completion of our knowledge of the osteology of this very\r\nremarkable and interesting genus of extinct mammiferous animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                DESCRIPTION OF PARTS OF THE SKELETON OF\r\n                       MACRAUCHENIA PATACHONICA;\r\n      _A large extinct Mammiferous Animal, referrible to the Order\r\n Pachydermata; but with affinities to the Ruminantia, and especially to\r\n                             the Camelidæ_.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages the nature and affinities of a large extinct\r\nMammal were attempted to be determined from the cranium and teeth\r\nexclusively: we come now to consider the remains of a quadruped\r\nconsisting of bones of the trunk and extremities, without a fragment of\r\na tooth or of the cranium to serve as a guide to its position in the\r\nzoological scale.\r\n\r\nIt may appear, even to anatomists and naturalists familiar with the kind\r\nof evidence afforded by a fossil fragment, that an opinion as to the\r\nrelation of the present species to a particular family of Ruminants,\r\nformed without a knowledge of the important organs of manducation, must\r\nbe vague and doubtful, but the evidence about to be adduced, will be\r\nregarded, it is hoped, as more conclusive than could have been _à\r\npriori_ expected.\r\n\r\nThe portions of the skeleton of the animal—which, in relation to the\r\naffinity above alluded to, as well as from the length of its neck, I\r\npropose to call _Macrauchenia_[16]—were discovered by Mr. Darwin in an\r\nirregular bed of sandy soil, overlying a horizontal accumulation of\r\ngravel on the south side of Port St. Julian: and independently of the\r\ncircumstances under which they were found, their correspondence with\r\neach other in size, colour, texture and general character prove them to\r\nhave belonged to one and the same individual.\r\n\r\nThese remains include two cervical vertebræ, seven lumbar vertebræ, all\r\nmore or less fractured; a portion of the sacrum and ossa innominata;\r\nfragments of the right scapula; of the right radius and ulna, and right\r\nfore-foot; the right femur nearly entire, the proximal and distal\r\nextremities of the right tibia and fibula; and a metatarsal bone of the\r\nright hind-foot.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the description of these remains, a few\r\nobservations may be advantageously premised on some of the\r\ndistinguishing characters of the Camelidæ. It is well known that the\r\nCamels and Llamas deviate in their dentition, viz., in the presence of\r\ntwo incisors in the upper jaw, from the true Ruminants; and we cannot\r\navoid perceiving that in this particular the direction in which they\r\ndeviate tends towards the conterminous Ungulate Order, in which incisor\r\nteeth are rarely absent in the upper jaw. They also further deviate from\r\nthe Ruminants and approach the Pachyderms in the absence of cotyledons\r\nin the uterus and fetal membranes; having, instead thereof, a diffused\r\nvascular villosity of the chorion, as in the sow and mare.\r\n\r\nBut besides these characters, by which, in receding from one type of\r\nhoofed mammalia, the Camelidæ claim affinity with another, there are\r\nmany parts of their organization peculiar to themselves; of some of\r\nthese peculiarities, the relation to the circumstances under which the\r\nanimal exists, can be satisfactorily traced; in others, the connection\r\nof the structure with the exigencies of the species, is by no means\r\nobvious, and in this predicament stands the osteological peculiarity,\r\nwhich is immediately connected with our present subject—a peculiarity in\r\nwhich the Camelidæ differ not only from the other Ruminants, but from\r\nall other existing Mammalia, and which consists in the absence of\r\nperforations for the vertebral arteries in the transverse processes of\r\nthe cervical vertebræ, the atlas excepted.\r\n\r\nI may observe that what is described as a perforation of a single\r\ntransverse process in a cervical vertebra is essentially a space\r\nintervening between two transverse processes, a rudimental rib, and the\r\nbody of the vertebra. In the cold-blooded Saurians,—in which the\r\nconfluence of the separate elements of a vertebra takes place tardily\r\nand imperfectly, if at all,—the nature of the so called perforation of\r\nthe transverse process is very clearly manifested, as in the cervical\r\nvertebræ of the Crocodile, in which the interspace of the inferior and\r\nsuperior transverse processes is closed externally by a separate short\r\nmoveable cervical rib. In the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus the vertebra\r\ndentata also preserves throughout life this condition of its lateral\r\nappendages: in other Mammalia it is only in the fœtal state that the two\r\ntransverse processes are manifested on each side with their extremities\r\nunited by a distinct cartilage, which afterwards becomes ossified and\r\nanchylosed to them.\r\n\r\nIn the Hippopotamus the inferior transverse process sends downwards a\r\nbroad flat plate extended nearly in the axis of the neck, but so\r\nobliquely, that the posterior margins of these processes, in one\r\nvertebra, overlap the anterior ones of the succeeding vertebra below,\r\nlike the cervical ribs in the Crocodile; the same structure obtains in\r\nmany other mammalia, especially in the Marsupials. In the Giraffe, the\r\ninferior transverse processes are represented by relatively smaller\r\ncompressed laminæ, projecting obliquely downwards and outwards from the\r\nanterior and inferior extremity of the body of the vertebra. The\r\nsuperior transverse processes in this animal are very slightly developed\r\nin any of the cervical vertebræ, and the perforation for the vertebral\r\nartery is above and generally in front of the rudiment of this process,\r\nbeing continued as it were through the side of the substance of the body\r\nof the vertebræ.\r\n\r\nIn the long cervical vertebræ of the Camel and Llama, the upper and\r\nlower transverse processes are not developed in the same perpendicular\r\nplane on the sides of the vertebræ, but at some distance from each\r\nother; the lower transverse processes (_a_, fig. 1, Pl. VI.; _a_, fig.\r\n1, 3, 4, Pl. VII.) being given off from the lower part of the anterior\r\nextremity of the body of the vertebra; the upper ones (_b_, fig. 1, Pl.\r\nVI.; _a_, fig. 1, 3, 4, Pl. VII.) from the base of the superior arch\r\nnear the posterior part of the vertebra, or from the sides of the\r\nposterior part of the body of the vertebræ. The extremities of these\r\ntransverse processes do not become united together, but they either pass\r\ninto each other at their base, or continue throughout life separated by\r\nan oblique groove (as in fig. 1, Pl. VI.) This groove would not,\r\nhowever, afford sufficient defence for the important arteries supplying\r\nthose parts of the brain which are most essential to life; and,\r\naccordingly the vertebral arteries here deviate from their usual course,\r\nin order that adequate protection may be afforded to them in their\r\ncourse along the neck. From the sixth to the second cervical vertebræ\r\ninclusive in the _Aucheniæ_, and from the fifth to the second inclusive\r\nin the _Cameli_,[17] the vertebral arteries enter the vertebral canal\r\nitself, along with the spinal chord, at the posterior aperture in each\r\nvertebra, run forwards on the outside of the dura mater of the chord\r\nbetween it and the vertebral arch, and when they have thus traversed\r\nabout two-thirds of the spinal canal, they perforate respectively the\r\nsuperior vertebral laminæ, and emerge directly beneath the anterior\r\noblique or articulating processes, whence they are continued along with\r\nthe spinal chord into the vertebral canal of the succeeding vertebra,\r\nand perforate the sides of the anterior part of the superior arch in\r\nlike manner; and so on through all the cervical vertebræ until they\r\nreach the atlas, in which their disposition, and consequently the\r\nstructure of the arterial canals, resemble those in other Ruminants.\r\n\r\nThe two cervical vertebræ of the Macrauchenia present precisely the\r\nstructure and disposition of the bony canals for the vertebral arteries\r\nwhich are peculiarly characteristic of the Camelidæ among existing\r\nMammalia. In Plate VI. fig. 2, the groove and orifices of the canal for\r\nthe vertebral artery are shown in a section exposing the spinal canal:\r\nin Plate VII. figures 1 and 3 exhibit the orifices at the commencement\r\nof the arterial canals, as seen in a posterior view of the vertebræ; in\r\nfigs. 2 and 4, the terminations of the same canals are shown, in the\r\nanterior view of the same vertebræ; the smaller figures (3 and 4) are\r\ntaken from the fourth cervical vertebra of a Llama. The vertebræ of the\r\nMacrauchenia also closely resemble the middle cervical vertebræ of the\r\nVicugna and Llama in their elongated form; approaching the Auchenial\r\ndivision of the Camelidæ, and deviating from the true Camels in the\r\nrelations of the length of the body of the vertebra to its breadth and\r\ndepth, and in the much smaller size of the inferior processes. Excepting\r\nthe Giraffe, there is no existing mammal which possesses cervical\r\nvertebræ so long as the Macrauchenia; but the cervical vertebræ of the\r\nGiraffe, differ in the situation of the perforations for the vertebral\r\narteries, and in the form of the terminal articular surfaces, as will be\r\npresently noticed.\r\n\r\nBoth of the cervical vertebræ of the _Macrauchenia_ here described, are\r\nof the same size, each measures six inches and a half in extreme length,\r\ntwo inches, ten lines in breadth, and two inches, four lines in depth.\r\nIn the Giraffe and the Camelidæ, the spinous processes are thin laminæ\r\nof considerable extent in the axis of the vertebra, but rising to a very\r\nshort distance above the level of the vertebral arch: the spinous\r\nprocesses have the same form in the corresponding vertebræ of the\r\nMacrauchenia, but present a still greater longitudinal extent; they\r\ncommence at the interspace of the anterior oblique processes, and extend\r\nto opposite the base of the posterior oblique processes; the upper\r\nmargin describing a gentle curve, as shown in fig. 1, Pl. VI. The\r\ntransverse processes also present the form of slightly produced, but\r\nlongitudinally extended, laminæ: their disposition is essentially the\r\nsame as in the Camelidæ, but more nearly corresponds with the\r\nmodifications presented by the Aucheniæ. The inferior transverse\r\nprocesses,—those which are alone developed in fish, but which are not\r\npresent in any other vertebræ save the cervical, in mammalia,—these\r\nprocesses in the Macrauchenia are continued from the sides of the under\r\nsurface of the anterior part of the body of the vertebra; their\r\nextremities being broken off, it cannot be determined how far they\r\nextended from the body of the vertebræ, but they gradually subside as\r\nthey pass backwards: the superior transverse processes are continued\r\noutwards from the sides of the posterior part of the body of the\r\nvertebra, and gradually subside as they advance forwards along\r\nthree-fourths of the body of the vertebra: they are not continued into\r\nthe anterior and inferior transverse processes, as in the Vicugna, but\r\nare separated therefrom by a narrow and shallow groove. The articular,\r\nor oblique processes, closely resemble those of the Auchenia in form,\r\nand in the direction of the articular surfaces; those of the anterior\r\nprocesses looking inwards and a little upwards; those of the posterior,\r\noutwards and a little downwards.\r\n\r\nIn the Macrauchenia a small longitudinal process (_c_, fig. 2, Pl. VII.)\r\nis given off immediately below the base of the anterior oblique process;\r\nthis structure is not observable in any of the cervical vertebræ of the\r\nGiraffe or Camelidæ.\r\n\r\nIn the form of the articulating surfaces of the bodies of the vertebræ\r\nthe Macrauchenia deviates from the Giraffe and Camel, but resembles the\r\nAucheniæ. In the Giraffe and Camel the anterior articulating surface is\r\nconvex and almost hemispheric, the posterior surface is proportionally\r\nconcave, so that the cervical vertebræ are articulated by ball and\r\nsocket joints; yet not, as in most Reptiles, with intervening synovial\r\ncavities, but by the concentric ligamentous intervertebral substance\r\ncharacteristic of the Mammiferous class. In the Llama and Vicugna, the\r\ndegree of convexity and concavity in the articular surface of the bodies\r\nof the cervical vertebræ is much less than in the Camels; and in\r\nconsequence they carry their necks more stiffly and more in a straight\r\nline. In Macrauchenia the anterior articulating surface (fig. 2, Pl.\r\nVII.) presents a still slighter convexity than in the Llama (fig. 4, Pl.\r\nVII.), and the posterior surface (fig. 1, Pl. VII.) presents a\r\ncorrespondingly shallower concavity. The form of the extremities of the\r\nbody of the vertebræ, especially of the posterior, is sub-hexagonal, the\r\nbreadth being to the depth as eight to five. The sides and under part of\r\nthe vertebræ are slightly concave; on the inferior surface there are two\r\nridges, continued forwards from the posterior margin of the vertebra,\r\neach situated about an inch distant from the middle line; they converge\r\nas they pass forwards, and are gradually lost in the level of the\r\nvertebra; their greatest elevation does not exceed half an inch. In the\r\nAucheniæ there is a longitudinal protuberance in the mesial line,\r\ninstead of the two ridges. The two long cervical vertebræ of the\r\nMacrauchenia are also characterized by the maintenance of an almost\r\nuniform diameter of the body, both in its vertical and transverse\r\nextent; the cervical vertebræ of the Vicugna come nearest to them in\r\nthis respect; those of the Camel deviate further in the large excavation\r\nat the under part of the body.\r\n\r\nThe long vertebral or spinal canal offers a slight enlargement at the\r\ntwo extremities; this structure which is generally in the ratio of the\r\nextent of motion of the vertebræ on each other is more marked in the\r\nCamel, where the form and mode of articulation of the bodies of the\r\nvertebræ are designed to admit of a free and extensive inflection of the\r\ncervical vertebræ; and the result of this structure is very obvious in\r\nthe sigmoid flexure of the neck in the living animal. In the Aucheniæ,\r\non the contrary, the neck is carried less gracefully erect and in an\r\nalmost straight line, and the form of the vertebræ and the nature of\r\ntheir joints correspond, as we have seen, to this condition. From the\r\nlength of the bodies of the cervical vertebræ of the Macrauchenia, and\r\nthe almost flattened form of their anterior and posterior articular\r\nsurfaces, I infer that the long neck in this singular quadruped must\r\nhave been carried in the same stiff and upright position as in the\r\nVicugna and Guanaco.\r\n\r\nThe following individual differences are observable in the two cervical\r\nvertebræ of the Macrauchenia;—in the posterior one the superior arch is\r\nwider and with thicker parietes, the body is more concave below, and the\r\ninferior transverse processes have a more lengthened origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a fragment of dorsal vertebræ, ribs or sternum, is included in the\r\ncollection of the bones of the Macrauchenia; but fortunately seven\r\nlumbar vertebræ, forming a consecutive series of the same individual as\r\nthat to which the cervical vertebræ belonged, were obtained, all more or\r\nless fractured, but all sufficiently perfect to demonstrate their true\r\nnature. These vertebræ, although not possessing such distinctive\r\ncharacters as the cervical, contribute by no means an unimportant\r\nelement towards the illustration of the osteology of the Macrauchenia,\r\nand support the view which I have taken of its affinities; for,\r\nalthough, as will be seen from the structure of its extremities, this\r\nanimal must be referred to the Order Pachydermata, yet no existing\r\nspecies of that order has more than six lumbar vertebræ; whilst among\r\nthe Ruminants it is only in the Camel, Dromedary, Llama and Vicugna,\r\nthat the lumbar vertebræ reach the number seven,—the same number which\r\ncharacterizes the extinct annectant species in question. The dimensions\r\nof the vertebræ in the Macrauchenia present the same relations to the\r\ntwo cervical vertebræ above described, which the lumbar vertebræ of the\r\nVicugna bear to the third, fourth, or fifth of its cervical vertebræ.\r\nBut here we begin to discover modifications of form, in which the\r\nMacrauchenia deviates from the Camelidæ, and approaches the Pachyderms,\r\nas the Horse and Hippopotamus; and these indications become stronger as\r\nthe vertebræ approach the sacrum.\r\n\r\nIn the Camel, as well as in the Horse and Hippopotamus, the bodies of\r\nthe lumbar vertebræ diminish in vertical extent, or become flatter, as\r\nthey approach the sacrum; but this character is more strongly marked in\r\nthe Macrauchenia than in either of the above species. But in the\r\nCamelidæ the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebræ, are elongated,\r\nflattened, and narrow, resembling ribs, except that they are nearly\r\nstraight; and this is more particularly the case with the transverse\r\nprocesses of the last lumbar vertebræ, which are the narrowest of all in\r\nproportion to their length, and stand freely out without touching the\r\nsacrum. The transverse processes of the lumbar vertebræ of the Giraffe\r\nresemble those of the Camel, but are relatively smaller and shorter. In\r\nthe Hippopotamus the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebræ are\r\nmuch broader in proportion to their length than in any of the Ruminants,\r\nand they increase in breadth to the last lumbar vertebra, which presents\r\nin addition, the following characters; each transverse process sends off\r\nfrom its posterior margin a thickened and transversely elongated\r\nprotuberance, which supports a flattened articular surface adapted to a\r\ncorresponding surface on the anterior part of the transverse process of\r\nthe first sacral vertebra: it likewise presents on its anterior edge a\r\nflattened and rough surface, which is closely attached by ligamentous\r\nsubstance to the opposite part of the transverse process of the\r\npenultimate lumbar vertebra. A similar structure exists in the last two\r\nlumbar vertebræ of the Rhinoceros, Tapir, and Horse. In the latter\r\nanimal, anchylosis of these articulating surfaces of the lumbar and\r\nsacral vertebræ generally takes place with age, and, judging from the\r\ncharacter of the same surfaces in the Hippopotamus, the motion of its\r\nlumbar vertebræ upon the sacrum may in like manner become ultimately\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nNow in the Macrauchenia, as in the Pachyderms above cited, the\r\ntransverse processes of the last lumbar vertebræ are of considerable\r\nthickness and extent, and are joined by enarthrosis to the transverse\r\nprocesses of the sacrum; but the bony structure of these joints would\r\nindicate that they were not subject to be obliterated by anchylosis. The\r\narticular surfaces which project from the posterior part of the\r\ntransverse processes of the last lumbar vertebræ present a regular and\r\nsmooth concavity, adapted to a corresponding convexity in the transverse\r\nprocesses of the first sacral vertebra. These articulating surfaces have\r\nevidently been covered with smooth cartilage; they present a pretty\r\nregular transverse ellipsoid form. A view of the three joints by which,\r\nindependently of the two oblique processes, the last lumbar vertebra of\r\nthe Macrauchenia was articulated with the sacrum, is given in Plate\r\nVIII. fig. 1. The transverse processes of the posterior lumbar vertebra,\r\nbesides their agreement with those of the Horse and Hippopotamus in the\r\nstructure just described, also correspond with them in general form, and\r\ndeviate remarkably from those of the _Camelidæ_ in their great breadth.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the articulations on the body and transverse\r\nprocesses of the last lumbar vertebra of the Macrauchenia differ from\r\nthe corresponding articular surfaces of the Horse, inasmuch as the\r\nmiddle surface is convex, while the two lateral ones are concave, and\r\nthese are moreover relatively larger than either in the Horse or\r\nHippopotamus: by this structure the trunk was more firmly locked to that\r\nsegment of the vertebral column, which receives and transmits to the\r\nrest of the body the motive impetus derived from the hinder extremities,\r\nwhich are in all quadrupeds the chief powers in progression; while at\r\nthe same time the shock must have been diminished by the great extent of\r\ninterposed elastic cartilages; and a certain yielding or sliding motion\r\nwould be allowed between the lumbar vertebræ and sacrum.\r\n\r\nThe anterior oblique processes of the lumbar vertebræ of the\r\nMacrauchenia (fig. 4, Pl. VIII.) have concave articular facets turned\r\ntowards, and nearly continued into, each other at their lower\r\nextremities; so as to form together a deep semilunar notch, into which\r\nthe corresponding convex articular surfaces of the posterior oblique\r\nprocesses of the adjoining vertebra (fig. 3, Pl. VIII.) are firmly\r\nlocked. In the close approximation of the two anterior concave articular\r\nfacets, which are separated from each other only by a vertical ridge,\r\nand a rough surface of about three or four lines in breadth, the lumbar\r\nvertebræ of the Macrauchene resemble those of the Horse, and differ from\r\nthose of the Camel tribe and Ruminants generally, in which those\r\nsurfaces are wider apart. In the hook-like form, however, of these\r\narticular processes the lumbar vertebræ of the Macrauchene differ from\r\nthose of the Horse; and resemble those of many Ruminant species, and of\r\nthe Anoplothere;[18] but the degree of concavity of the articulating\r\nsurface is not so great in the Macrauchene. It would be interesting to\r\ndetermine the relations which the lumbar vertebræ of the Macrauchene\r\nbear to those of the Palæothere; but the indication which Cuvier gives\r\nof the single lumbar vertebra, of which he had cognizance in the latter\r\ngenus[19] is too slight to enable me to enter upon the comparison.\r\n\r\nThe whole length of the lumbar region in the Macrauchene is twenty\r\ninches. When the bodies of these vertebræ are naturally adapted\r\ntogether, they form a slight curve, indicating that the loins of the\r\nMacrauchene were arched, or bent downwards towards the sacrum. That the\r\nlumbar vertebræ were rigidly connected together, or but slightly\r\nflexible, is evident from the flatness of the articular surfaces of the\r\nvertebral body, and by the circumstance of ossification having extended\r\nalong the anterior vertebral ligaments, and produced an anchylosis\r\nbetween the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebræ; (fig. 2, _c_, Pl. VIII.)\r\nThis kind of ossification is frequent in aged horses, and I have seen an\r\nexample of a similar anchylosis of the lumbar vertebræ, by abnormal\r\ndeposition of bone in their anterior ligaments, in the skeleton of a\r\nHippopotamus preserved in the Senkenbergian Museum, at Frankfort.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the preceding account of the cervical and lumbar regions of\r\nthe vertebral column of the Macrauchene, I have felt frequently a strong\r\ndesire to enter into a comparison between them and the corresponding\r\nvertebræ of the extinct Pachyderms of the Paris Basin. Some of these, as\r\nthe _Anoplotherium gracile_, in the length and slenderness of the\r\ncervical vertebræ, resemble both _Auchenia_ and _Macrauchenia_; others,\r\nas the _Palæotherium minus_, and probably the rest of the genus,\r\nresemble the _Camelidæ_ and _Macrauchenia_ in having seven lumbar\r\nvertebræ. Cuvier points out the resemblance which the atlas of the\r\nAnoplothere bears to that of the Camel, and especially of the Llama;[20]\r\nbut he expressly notices the existence of the canals for the vertebral\r\nartery in the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra of the _Anoplotherium\r\ncommune_.[21] Do the cervical vertebræ—say from the third to the sixth\r\ninclusive—of the _Palæotherium_ present an imperforate condition of\r\ntheir transverse processes, or exterior part of their sides? Cuvier, who\r\nseems not to have been aware of this peculiarity in the _Camelidæ_,\r\nmerely notices the absence of these arterial foramina in the last\r\ncervical vertebra of the _Palæotherium minus_,[22] which, unfortunately\r\nfor the comparison I am desirous of establishing, is that which most\r\ncommonly presents this imperforate condition in the Mammalia generally.\r\nAs, however, the cervical vertebræ of the Palæothere had the anterior\r\narticular surface of the body convex, and the transverse processes\r\nproduced into descending laminæ, it is most probable that they\r\ncorresponded with the cervical vertebræ of the typical Pachyderms in the\r\ncondition of their arterial foramina.\r\n\r\nThe sacrum and ossa innominata in the present specimen of _Macrauchenia_\r\nare very imperfect; but sufficient is preserved to show that the sacrum\r\nwas anchylosed to the ilia: the lower boundary of this anchylosis is\r\nmarked below by an external ridge, and by vascular canals and grooves in\r\nthe substance of the bone, as in the Hippopotamus. The body of the\r\nsacrum is lost, but the smooth articular convexities upon the transverse\r\nprocesses adapted to the articular depressions of the last lumbar\r\nvertebra are fortunately preserved.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the anterior extremity of our Macrauchenia include\r\nfragments of a left scapula; the proximal extremities of the anchylosed\r\nbones of the right antibrachium; the metacarpal and most of the\r\nphalangeal bones of the right fore-foot. The first-mentioned fragments,\r\ninclude the head and neck of the scapula, a small part of its body with\r\nthe beginning of the spine, the coracoid process, and the nearly entire\r\nglenoid cavity. This articular surface (fig. 2, Pl. IX.) resembles in\r\nits general form, and degree of concavity, that of the Camel and\r\nRhinoceros, and is deeper than in the Hippopotamus. The coracoid process\r\nis represented by a slightly produced rough, thick, and obtuse\r\ntuberosity, situated closer to the glenoid cavity than in the _Camelidæ_\r\nor _Rhinoceros_, and having almost the same relative position and size,\r\nas in the _Palæotherium crassum_. The superior border or costa of the\r\nscapula presents much variety in the Ungulate quadrupeds with which we\r\nhave to compare the Macrauchenia. In the Ruminants its contour forms\r\nbehind the coracoid a concave sweep, which advances close to the spine\r\nof the scapula. In the Camel and Horse the marginal concavity is\r\nshallower, and the distance of the superior costa from the spine of the\r\nscapula is greater; the extent of the supra-spinal fossa increases in\r\nthe true Pachyderms, and the Macrauchene agrees with them in this\r\nstructure. In the Tapir, however, the contour of the superior costa is\r\nbroken by a deep round notch immediately behind the coracoid: in the\r\nHippopotamus this process arches in a slight degree backward over a\r\ncorresponding but wider and shallower notch. In the _Palæotherium\r\ncrassum_ the concavity of the superior costa, behind the coracoid, is as\r\nslight as in the Rhinoceros; but in the Macrauchenia the superior costa\r\nof the scapula begins to rise or stretch away from the parallel of the\r\nspine, immediately behind the coracoid process. The modifications of the\r\nspine of the scapula which characterize respectively the Ruminants and\r\nPachyderms have been clearly and concisely set forth by Cuvier, who at\r\nthe same time points out the exceptional condition which the _Camelidæ_\r\npresent in the production of the acromial angle. It was with peculiar\r\ninterest and care, therefore, that I reunited all the fragments of the\r\nscapula of the Macrauchene, in the hope of gaining from this part of the\r\nskeleton as decisive evidence of an affinity to the Camel as the\r\ncervical vertebræ had afforded. It unfortunately happens, however, that\r\nthe part of the scapula most important in this comparison is broken off;\r\nyet from this very circumstance, combined with a slight inclination\r\nforwards of the anterior margin of the spine immediately beneath the\r\nfractured acromion, and from the thickness of the fractured surface, we\r\nmay infer that the acromial angle of the spine was more produced than in\r\nthe ordinary Ruminants, although evidently in a less degree than in the\r\nCamel tribe. The Macrauchenia, however, surpasses these aberrant\r\nRuminants, and equals the Pachyderms in the elevation and extent of its\r\nscapular spine: but this process commences about half an inch behind the\r\nglenoid cavity, and rises at once to the height of three inches above\r\nthe plane of the scapula; in which structure we may trace the same\r\ntendency to the Ruminant type, as is manifested in the scapula of the\r\nHippopotamus and Anoplotherium; for in most other Pachyderms the spine\r\nincreases gradually from its extremities to the middle part. The\r\nanterior margin of the spine beneath the short acromion is perforated by\r\nan elliptical fissure measuring ten lines, by three lines. The extent of\r\nthe spine which is preserved, measures eight inches and a half; it is a\r\nthin and nearly straight plate of bone, expanding into a thick and\r\nrugged upper margin, which slightly over-arches the inferior fossa.\r\n(fig. 1, Pl. IX.) In its general form and proportions the spine of the\r\nscapula in Macrauchenia presents the nearest resemblance to that of the\r\nHippopotamus; but its origin is closer to the articular surface of the\r\nscapula than in this, or any other Pachydermal or Ruminant genus.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the antibrachium of the Macrauchenia which is preserved,\r\npresents a condition of the radius and ulna intermediate to those which\r\nrespectively characterize the same bones in the Pachyderms and Camels.\r\nIn the former the radius and ulna are separate bones, united in the\r\nprone position by ligament, yet so that the movement of supination\r\ncannot be performed; in the ordinary Ruminants they are partially joined\r\nby bony confluence, which rarely extends to the proximal extremities; in\r\nthe Camel and Llama the anchylosis of the radius and ulna is so\r\ncomplete, that no trace of their original separation can be perceived,\r\nand the olecranon appears but as a mere process of the radius.\r\n\r\nIn the Macrauchenia the anchylosis of the radius and ulna is also\r\ncomplete, but the boundary line of the two originally distinct bones is\r\nvery manifest, and the proportion which each contributes to the great\r\narticulating surface for the distal end of the humerus is readily\r\ndistinguishable. About a sixth part of this surface is due to the head\r\nof the radius, which enters into the composition of the anterior and\r\nouter part of the articulation, and its extent is defined by a depressed\r\nline describing a pretty regular curve, with the concavity directed\r\nforwards and a little outwards. (_a_, fig. 1, Pl. X.) Just below the\r\narticular surface a strong triangular rugged protuberance projects from\r\nthe front of the head of the radius, for the attachment of the tendon of\r\nthe biceps. The line of separation of the radius and ulna is indicated\r\non the inner side of the head of the radius by a deep and narrow fissure\r\nextending downwards from below the anterior part of the articulating\r\nsurface; and on the outer side by a broad groove leading upwards to a\r\ndeep pit near the proximal end of the antibrachium. We may see by the\r\ndirection of the head of the radius which is thus defined, that it\r\ncrosses obliquely in front of the ulna, as in the Elephant,\r\nHippopotamus, and other Pachyderms, and that the bones are anchylosed in\r\nthe prone condition: below this fissure and groove, which mark the\r\ninterosseous line, the radius and ulna become blended together into one\r\ncompact bone, which is flattened from before backwards, with a well\r\nmarked ridge on the outer side; and excavated by a single medullary\r\ncavity, the compact walls of which present a general thickness of\r\none-third of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe proximal articular surface or sigmoid cavity of the antibrachium,\r\nconstituted as above described, resembles that of the Palæothere, Tapir,\r\nand the generality of the Pachyderms in having two depressions, instead\r\nof three, as in the Anoplothere, and Ruminants. The Hippopotamus has a\r\nslight tendency to the latter structure, which is also less marked in\r\nthe Camel than in the ordinary Ruminants. In its general form the\r\nsigmoid cavity of the Macrauchene resembles that of the Hippopotamus\r\nmore than that of the Camel. In the Camel this articular surface is\r\ntraversed transversely by a broad, shallow, and slightly roughened\r\ntract, which divides the smooth surface of the joint into two parts, one\r\nforming the anterior horizontal surface due to the conjoined radius and\r\nulna, the other forming the vertical concave surface on the anterior\r\npart of the base of the olecranon. In the Hippopotamus there is, as it\r\nwere, an attempt at a similar division of the articulating surface at\r\nthe proximal end of the antibrachial bones; a deeper and rougher\r\ndepression encroaches upon the articulation from its outer side, but\r\nstops when it has reached half-way across. In the Macrauchenia the\r\nroughened surface, (_b_. fig. 1, Pl. X.) commencing also at the outside,\r\nextends only one-third of the way across the articular surface: it is,\r\nhowever, as shallow as in the Camel. The articular surface on the\r\nanterior part of the base of the olecranon is broader in the\r\nHippopotamus than in the Camel; but in the Macrauchene it is twice as\r\nbroad as in the Hippopotamus. The size of the olecranon in the\r\nMacrauchene exceeds that of the Hippopotamus, and _à fortiori_ that of\r\nthe Camel: indeed in its general magnitude the Macrauchenia must have\r\nfully equalled the largest Hippopotamus; but it no doubt had a more\r\nshapely, and less broad and bulky trunk. The olecranon of the\r\nMacrauchenia differs in shape, both from that of the Camel and\r\nHippopotamus; it terminates above in a three-sided cone with an obtuse\r\napex; and presents a well-marked protuberance at the outer side of the\r\nbase, which is not present in either the Camel or Hippopotamus. There is\r\nalso a strong rugged ridge on the back part of the olecranon which makes\r\nan angle before sinking into the level of the ulna below.\r\n\r\nThe confirmation of the close affinity of the Macrauchenia to the\r\nPachydermatous Order, which the structure of the cervical vertebræ alone\r\nmight have rendered very doubtful, is afforded by the bones of the right\r\nfore-foot (Pl. XI.); these are fortunately in so perfect a condition, as\r\nto make it certain that this interesting quadruped had three toes on the\r\nfore-feet, and not more; and that the fully developed metacarpal bones\r\nare distinct, and correspond in number with the toes, and are not\r\nanchylosed into a single cannon bone, as in the Ruminants. The bones\r\npreserved are the metacarpals, proximal phalanges, and middle phalanges\r\nof each of the three toes, and the distal phalanx of the innermost toe.\r\n\r\nThe proximal end of the innermost metacarpal bone presents three\r\narticular surfaces; the middle facet is the largest, and the two lateral\r\nones slope away from it at an angle of 45°. The middle facet is broad\r\nand slightly convex in front, narrow and concave behind; the distal\r\narticular surface of the trapezoides must have corresponded with this\r\nsurface; the outer facet is narrow, flat, extends from the fore to the\r\nback part of the head of the bone, and must have been adapted to a\r\ncorresponding surface on the os magnum; the inner facet is the smallest,\r\npresents a triangular form, and is situated towards the back part of the\r\nhead of the metacarpal bone; it indicates the existence of a rudimental\r\nmetacarpal bone, or vestige of a pollex. Below the outermost of the\r\nlateral surfaces there is a crescentic articular surface with its\r\nconcavity directed outwards and downwards (fig. 2, Pl. XV.), against\r\nwhich a corresponding convex articular surface of the middle metacarpal\r\nabuts, (fig. 3, Pl. XV.) External to this surface the proximal end of\r\nthe middle metacarpal bone presents two articular surfaces for the\r\ncarpus; the larger one, which was adapted to the os magnum, is\r\nhorizontal, broad and convex before, narrow and concave behind; the\r\noutermost facet is a small triangular surface inclined downwards to the\r\nlevel of the articulating surface of the outermost metacarpal. It also\r\npresents a posterior vertical articular surface for a sesamoid bone. The\r\nproximal extremity of the outer metacarpal bone is joined to the middle\r\nmetacarpal, not by one semilunar surface, but by two separate\r\narticulations of small size (fig. 4 and 5, Pl. XV.); it presents a\r\nsingle large slightly convex articular surface for the os magnum, of an\r\nirregular semicircular form, with the convexity of the curve turned\r\noutwards.\r\n\r\nThe metacarpus increases in breadth as it approaches the phalanges; the\r\ntwo lateral metacarpals bending slightly away from the middle one, and\r\nexpanding towards their distal extremities: the middle bone presents a\r\nsymmetrical figure except at its proximal extremity (fig. 2, Pl. XI.)\r\nThe distal articulating facet of each of the metacarpal bones extends so\r\nfar upon both the anterior and posterior surfaces as to describe more\r\nthan a semicircle (fig. 3, Pl. XI.); in the two lateral metacarpals it\r\nis traversed throughout by a longitudinal convex ridge dividing it into\r\ntwo equal lateral parts; the ridge is most produced on the posterior\r\nhalf of the joint (fig. 4, Pl. XI.): in the middle metacarpal this ridge\r\nsubsides before it reaches the anterior part of the articular surface.\r\n\r\nThe proximal extremity of the middle proximal phalanx presents a\r\nposterior notch corresponding to the above partially developed ridge:\r\nthe proximal extremities of the lateral phalanges are traversed by a\r\nmiddle longitudinal depression, and two lateral shallow concavities\r\n(fig. 6, Pl. XI.); but these are of such an extent as to be in contact\r\nwith only a part of the convexity above, which therefore was doubtless\r\nadapted to a sesamoid bone on each side of the longitudinal ridge. The\r\nstructure of the above described joints proves that the motion of the\r\ntoe upon the metacarpus was much freer and more extensive than in the\r\nRhinoceros, which is the only existing Ungulate mammal which presents\r\nthe tridactyle structure in the fore-foot. In this species the\r\nmetacarpo-phalangeal articulations exhibit only a slight trace of the\r\nlongitudinal ridges and grooves which are confined to the posterior part\r\nof the joint; these are more developed in the _Camelidæ_; but the Hog\r\nand Horse in this respect approach nearer to the Macrauchene, though the\r\nstructure of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints in the Hog falls far short\r\nof the compactness and strength combined with freedom of play in flexion\r\nand extension which distinguish those of the Macrauchene. The\r\n_Palæotherium medium_ most resembles the Macrauchene in the structure of\r\nthe trochlear metacarpo-phalangeal joints; but both in this species,[23]\r\nand the _Pal. crassum_[24] the articular surface at the distal end of\r\nthe metacarpal is relatively narrower than in the Macrauchenia; moreover\r\nall the species of the extinct Palæothere differ from the Macrauchene in\r\nthe greater size and strength of the middle as compared with the lateral\r\nmetacarpals.\r\n\r\nThe articulation at the distal extremity of the proximal phalanges (fig.\r\n5, Pl. XI.) is simple, and not divided into two pulleys by a\r\nlongitudinal ridge; it is slightly concave from side to side; but in its\r\nextent upon the anterior and posterior surfaces of the bone indicates a\r\nfreedom of flexion and extension of the toes, which harmonizes with the\r\nstructure of the joint above.\r\n\r\nThe proximal articulating surfaces of the second phalanges (fig. 7, Pl.\r\nXI.) corresponds of course to those to which they are adapted; they are,\r\nhowever, characterized by sending upwards an obtuse process from the\r\nmiddle of their anterior margin. The distal articulating surfaces (fig.\r\n8, Pl. XI.) resemble those of the proximal phalanges, but extend further\r\nupon the back part of the phalanx than the front, indicating the more\r\nhorizontal position of the second phalanges.\r\n\r\nThe last phalanx, does not resemble the neatly defined ungulate\r\nphalanges of the Ruminantia, and Solipedia, but has the irregular form\r\ncharacteristic of those of the Pachydermata. It is wedge-shaped, broader\r\nthan it is long, with a rugged surface, except where it plays upon the\r\ndistal end of the second phalanx, where it is slightly concave in one\r\ndirection, and convex in the other, (figs. 7 and 9, Pl. XI.) A portion\r\nof this phalanx extends backwards behind the articular surface, as in\r\nthe corresponding bone of the Palæothere and Rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThe femur of the Macrauchenia (fig. 1, Pl. XII.) is full two feet in\r\nlength, and consequently longer than in any known Camel or Rhinoceros;\r\nas compared with its transverse diameter it is much longer than the\r\nfemur of the latter animal: in the proportion of its breadth to its\r\nlength, and the expansion of its extremities as compared with the\r\ndiameter of the shaft, it more resembles that of the Camel. The femur of\r\nthe Giraffe deviates from that of the Macrauchenia in the excessive\r\nexpansion of its distal extremity. But the most striking evidence\r\ndeducible from this bone, of the affinity of the Macrauchenia to the\r\ntrue Pachydermatous type is afforded by the evident traces of a third\r\ntrochanter, the outline of which is conjecturally restored in the\r\nfigure. Of the Pachyderms which have this characteristic structure, the\r\nextinct Palæothere offers the nearest resemblance to the Macrauchene in\r\nthe general form and structure of the femur.\r\n\r\nThe head of the femur in the Macrauchene (fig. 2, Pl. XII.) presents the\r\nform of a pretty regular hemisphere; it is less flattened above, and is\r\ndirected more obliquely inwards than in the Palæothere: the neck\r\nsupporting it does not project so far from the shaft as in the\r\nPalæothere or Tapir, but farther than in the Camel. The great trochanter\r\nrises above the level of the head; in which structure and in the\r\ndepression between the head and trochanter, the femur of the Macrauchene\r\noffers a character intermediate between the Tapir or Palæothere, and the\r\nCamel. The lesser trochanter is a slight projection from a ridge of bone\r\nwhich is continued from the under part of the head of the femur to the\r\ninner surface of the shaft. In the Palæothere the lesser trochanter is\r\nsituated more towards the posterior surface of the femur; so that, in\r\nthis particular, the Macrauchene approaches nearer to the Camel. Cuvier\r\nmakes no mention of the condition of the depression for the _ligamentum\r\nteres_ in the Palæothere. Among existing ordinary Pachyderms the\r\nHippopotamus presents no trace of the insertion of a _ligamentum teres_\r\nin the head of the femur; in the Camel the place of its insertion is\r\nindicated by a well-marked circumscribed pit; in the Tapir a similar\r\ncircular depression is situated close to the inferior margin of the\r\narticular convexity. The ligament was undoubtedly present in\r\nMacrauchenia, but the place of its insertion is a broad and deep notch\r\nleading from the under and back part of the head of the bone a little\r\nway into its articular surface: this I regard as another of those\r\ninteresting transitional structures with which the remains of the\r\nMacrauchenia, few and imperfect though they unfortunately are, so freely\r\nabound.\r\n\r\nThe femur of Macrauchenia, in the flatness of the back part of its neck,\r\nand the elongated form of the post-trochanterian depression, resembles\r\nthat of the Camel rather than that of the Palæothere; and the same\r\nresemblance is shown in the cylindrical figure, straightness, and length\r\nof the shaft. The depth of the trochanterian depression, and the\r\nincurvation of the strong ridge continued downwards from the great\r\ntrochanter are individual peculiarities in the Macrauchenia.\r\n\r\nA great part of the third trochanter is broken off; but from the remains\r\nof its base we see that it had the same relative size as in the\r\nPalæothere; but it is situated at the middle of the shaft of the femur,\r\nand consequently lower down than in the Palæotheres and Tapirs. In the\r\ngeneral form and relative size of the condyles at the distal extremity\r\nof the femur (fig. 3, Pl. IX. and XII.) the Macrauchene is intermediate\r\nto the Camel and Palæothere, but resembles more the latter. In the\r\narticular surface for the patella, it deviates somewhat from the\r\nPalæothere, having this part longer in proportion to its breadth, more\r\nregularly and deeply concave from side to side, and with its lateral\r\nboundaries more sharply defined. In all these points the Macrauchene\r\napproaches the Camel: the same affinity is shown in the protuberance\r\nabove the inner condyle; but in the extent of the posterior projection\r\nof this condyle (fig. 3, Pl. IX.) it exceeds the Camel and Palæothere,\r\nand displays an intermediate structure between these species and the\r\nHippopotamus.\r\n\r\nThere is a rough crescentic depression above the outer condyle where the\r\nlinea aspera begins to diverge; the corresponding depression is deeper\r\nin the Hippopotamus, while in the Camel it is represented by a roughened\r\nsurface only, which is not depressed. In the fossa between the rotular\r\narticulation and the external condyle the Macrauchene resembles the\r\nCamel: the interspace of the condyles is relatively wider than in the\r\nCamel, and the process above the inner condyle is more angular; in both\r\nthese respects the Macrauchene inclines towards the Palæothere.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the structure of the bones of the leg of the Macrauchenia we find the\r\nsame transitional character which is afforded by the definable limits of\r\nthe anchylosed bones of the fore-arm. In the Pachyderma the fibula is an\r\nentire and distinct bone. In the Ruminantia, with the exception of the\r\nsmall Musk-deer, and, in an inferior degree, the Elk, the fibula appears\r\nonly as a short continuous process sent down from the under part of the\r\nexternal condyle of the tibia. In the Camel tribe the only trace of the\r\nfibula in the bones of the leg, is this process in a still more\r\nrudimental state. In the Macrauchenia the fibula is entire, but is\r\nconfluent with the tibia through nearly its whole extent: the proximal\r\npart of the fibula is well defined; its head is anchylosed to the outer\r\ncondyle of the tibia, but the shaft is continued free for the extent of\r\nnearly two inches, and then again becomes confluent with the tibia,\r\nforming apparently the outer ridge of that bone. About five inches from\r\nthe distal end of the tibia this outer ridge becomes flattened by being,\r\nas it were, pressed against the tibia, and the anterior and posterior\r\nedges are raised above the level of the tibia; beyond this part the\r\nlimits of the fibula begin again to be defined by deep vascular grooves.\r\nThe outer side of the distal end of the fibula is excavated by a broad\r\ntendinous groove. The fibula and tibia are distinct bones in both the\r\nPalæothere and Anoplothere, as in the Pachyderms. It is to the former\r\ngenus, however, especially _Pal. magnum_, that the Macrauchene presents\r\nthe nearest approach in the general form of the tibia, the principal\r\nbone of its leg: but in the Macrauchene the tibia is relatively shorter,\r\nand thicker, and is straighter and less expanded at its extremities,\r\nespecially the upper one, than in any of the Palæotheres.\r\n\r\nThe mesial boundaries of the two superior articulating surfaces of the\r\ntibia are raised in the form of ridges, which are separated by a deep\r\ngroove; of these ridges the external is the highest, as in _Pal.\r\nmagnum_: but the articular surfaces in the Macrauchene slope away from\r\nthese ridges more than in the Palæotheres. The rotular or anterior\r\ntuberosity of the tibia is more produced, and rises higher than in the\r\nPalæotheres; the ridge continued downwards from this process is more\r\nmarked in the Macrauchene, and its limits are better defined: the shaft\r\nof the tibia below the ridge is also more flattened in the\r\nantero-posterior direction than in the Palæothere. The configuration of\r\nthe back part of both proximal and distal extremities of the tibia are\r\nso clearly and accurately given in figures 2 and 3, Pl. XIII., as to\r\nrender verbal description unnecessary. Neither the text nor the figures\r\nin the ‘Ossemens Fossiles’ afford the means of pursuing the comparison\r\nbetween the Macrauchene and Palæothere in these particulars; and I\r\nproceed, therefore, to the consideration of the inferior articulating\r\nsurface of the bones of the leg (fig. 4, Pl. XIII.)\r\n\r\nSince, of the hind-foot, we possess in the present collection only a\r\nsingle tarsal and metatarsal bone, the structure of the distal articular\r\nsurface of the tibia is attended with peculiar interest, because we are\r\ntaught by Cuvier that it reveals to us in the Ungulate animals the\r\ndidactyle or tridactyle structure of the foot. In the Ruminants this\r\narticular surface is nearly square, and extended transversely between\r\ntwo perpendicular malleoli, while in the Pachyderms with three toes to\r\nthe hind-foot the articular surface of the tibia is oblique, and is\r\ndivided into two facets between the perpendicular malleolar boundaries.\r\nNow in the Macrauchenia, although the two bones of the leg are\r\nanchylosed together, the extent of that part of the tarsal articular\r\nsurface which is due to the tibia is indicated, as in the case of the\r\nradius in the joint of the fore-arm, by a groove; and we are thus able\r\nto compare this surface with the distal articular surface of the tibia\r\nin the Palæothere and Anoplothere. It presents in the Macrauchenia a\r\nvery close resemblance with that of the _Palæotherium magnum_,[25] being\r\ndivided into two facets by a convex rising, which traverses the joint\r\nfrom behind forwards; but the ridge is narrower, the internal facet\r\nsomewhat deeper, and the external oblique surface rather flatter than in\r\nthe three-toed Palæothere. In the portion of the tarsal articular\r\nsurface due to the fibula, we find, however, a more marked deviation\r\nfrom the Palæothere, and an interesting correspondence with the\r\nAnoplothere, in the inferior truncation and horizontal articular surface\r\nwhich is continued upon the lower extremity of the fibula, at right\r\nangles with the vertical malleolar facet which forms the outer boundary\r\nof the trochlea of the astragalus: this articular surface unerringly\r\nindicates a corresponding articular projection in the calcaneum, which,\r\ntherefore, although the bone itself does not form part of the present\r\ncollection, we may conclude to differ from the calcaneum of the\r\nPalæotherium, and to resemble that of the Anoplotherium, in this\r\nparticular at least.\r\n\r\nThe valuable indication which the distal articular surfaces of the\r\nanchylosed tibia and fibula have given of the correspondence of the\r\nhind-foot with the fore-foot of the Macrauchenia, in regard to the\r\nnumber of the toes, receives ample confirmation from the astragalus,\r\nwhich, of all the bones in the foot, is the one that an anatomist would\r\nhave chosen, had his choice been so limited, and which most fortunately\r\nhas been secured by Mr. Darwin, in a very perfect state, in the present\r\ninstance. I have compared this astragalus with that of the Giraffe, and\r\nother Ruminants, the Camel, the Anoplothere, the Horse, the Hog, the\r\nHippopotamus, Rhinoceros, Tapir, and Palæothere: it is with the\r\nPachyderms having three toes to the hind-foot, that the Macrauchenia\r\nagrees in the main distinguishing characters of this bone; its anterior\r\narticular surface, for example, is simple, and not divided into a double\r\ntrochlea by a vertical ridge: lastly, it is with the astragalus of the\r\nTapir and Palæothere that it presents the closest correspondence in the\r\ngeneral form and the minor details of structure, and with these\r\nPachyderms, therefore, I shall chiefly limit the comparison of the\r\nMacrauchenia, in regard to the bone in question. If the upper or tibial\r\narticular surface (fig. 5, Pl. XIV.) be compared with that in the\r\n_Palæotherium magnum_ (Ossem. Foss. Pl. LIV. fig. 2,) it will be seen,\r\nthat the general direction of that surface is more parallel with the\r\naxis of the bone in Macrauchenia. In the Palæotherium it is turned a\r\nlittle towards the outer or fibular side, and in the Tapir the general\r\ndirection of the same surface is placed still more obliquely. The\r\nanterior border of this articulating surface is broken by a semicircular\r\nnotch in the Palæothere; in the Tapir it describes a gentle concave\r\ncurve, and the Macrauchene resembles the Tapir in this respect. The\r\nchief difference between the astragalus of the Tapir and the Palæothere,\r\nwhen viewed from above, obtains in the relative length of the bone,\r\nanterior to the tibial articulating surface: the Macrauchene presents,\r\nin this respect, an intermediate structure, but differs from both in the\r\ngreater extent of the tibial side of this part of the astragalus.\r\n\r\nIf we next direct attention to the anterior or scaphoid articular\r\nsurface, (fig. 3, Pl. XIV.) and compare it with that of the\r\n_Palæotherium magnum_, (fig. 4, Pl. LIV, Ossem. Foss.) it will be seen,\r\nthat it presents in the Macrauchenia an oval, and in the Palæotherium an\r\nirregular quadrangular form: in the Macrauchenia, this surface is\r\nuniform or undivided, and is gently convex, except at its lower part;\r\nwhile in the Palæothere it is divided by an oblique ridge into a broad\r\ninternal facet for the scaphoid bone, and a narrow internal surface for\r\narticulation with the os cuboides; the larger surface is also concave\r\ntransversely, and slightly convex vertically: in the Tapir, the anterior\r\nsurface of the astragalus deviates still further from that of the\r\nMacrauchenia, both in general form, and in the proportion of the\r\ncuboidal facet. In the didactyle Anoplotherium, Camel, and true\r\nRuminants, where the cuboides presents a large relative size, a still\r\ngreater proportion of the anterior surface of the astragalus is devoted\r\nto the articulation with this bone, and is separated from the scaphoid\r\nsurface by a well-developed vertical ridge. The Macrauchenia presents,\r\ntherefore, the extreme variation from this type;—and should the entire\r\ntarsus hereafter be discovered, it will doubtless be found, that the os\r\ncuboides is articulated posteriorly to the os calcis exclusively.\r\n\r\nThe external surface of the astragalus of the Macrauchene, (fig. 1. Pl.\r\nXIV,) is longer in proportion to its vertical extent than in the Tapir\r\nor Palæothere: the articular surface for the fibular malleolus is less\r\ncurved. Between this surface and the anterior facet the bone is\r\nexcavated by a deep notch, both in the Tapir and Palæothere; but in the\r\nMacrauchenia by a gentle concavity. Beneath the malleolar articular\r\nsmooth surface in the Palæothere there is a deep pit; in the Tapir a\r\nshallow one; but in the Macrauchenia we observe only a smooth and\r\nslightly convex triangular surface. If we compare the inner surface of\r\nthe astragalus in these three animals, we shall find the existing Tapir\r\nagain forming a transition between the two extinct genera. In the\r\nPalæothere, a round protuberance projects from the anterior part of this\r\nsurface: in the Tapir, we observe a gentle rising of the bone in the\r\nsame part, while in the Macrauchene (fig. 2) the surface of the bone is\r\nlevel at this part. The margin of the tibial malleolar articular\r\nsurface, which is very slightly raised in the Macrauchene, is more\r\ndeveloped in the Tapir, and still more so in the Palæothere, where it\r\nforms a ridge, overhanging the rough outer side of the bone. Near the\r\nlower part of this surface we observe a small but deep depression in the\r\nPalæothere; there is a shallower one in the corresponding part in the\r\nTapir; and the depression is still wider and shallower in the\r\nMacrauchenia. In the Palæothere the astragalus articulates by three\r\nsurfaces with the os calcis, posteriorly by a large concave surface,\r\nexternally by a longitudinal sub-elliptic surface, and anteriorly by a\r\nthin transverse facet: in the Macrauchene (fig. 4) two only of these\r\nsurfaces are present, viz. the concave and the longitudinal one, the\r\nanterior transverse surface being wanting: in the Tapir, the transverse\r\nsurface is present, but is confluent with the longitudinal one. The\r\nposterior surface is relatively larger and deeper in the Macrauchene\r\nthan in the Palæothere, and approaches nearer to the triangular than the\r\noval form: the longitudinal surface is placed more obliquely, and is\r\ntruncated anteriorly. In the Tapir this surface is confluent with the\r\nscaphoid articular surface, but it is separated therefrom by a narrow\r\nstrip of bone in both the Palæothere and Macrauchene. It is satisfactory\r\nto find in the bone, which marks most strongly the affinity of\r\n_Macrauchenia_ to _Palæotherium_, so many easily recognizable\r\ndifferences, because the structure of the cervical vertebræ in the\r\nlatter genus is too imperfectly known, to allow us to predicate\r\nconfidently a distinction between it and _Macrauchenia_ in that\r\nparticular; the difference, however, which they present in the condition\r\nof the bones of the fore-arm and leg, forbids their being considered as\r\ngenerically related.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be noticed only a single fractured metatarsal bone\r\n(fig. 1. Pl. XV.) This, from its bent and unsymmetrical figure, is\r\nevidently not a middle one, and having the side of the proximal end,\r\nwhich was articulated to the adjoining metatarsal in a nearly perfect\r\nstate, it enables us to refer it with certainty to the hind-foot, since\r\nit does not agree with any of the corresponding surfaces at the proximal\r\nextremities of the metacarpal bones. It remains then to be determined,\r\nwhether it is an external metatarsal of the right-foot, or an internal\r\none of the left-foot, the general curvature of these being in the same\r\ndirection. With neither of these bones in the Tapir does our metatarsal\r\nagree, since it has but one articular facet on the lateral surface of\r\nits proximal end, while the outer metatarsal of the right-foot of the\r\nTapir, with which, in other respects, it most closely corresponds, has\r\ntwo articular surfaces. In the cast of a hind-foot of a Palæothere, I\r\nfind that the outer metatarsal bone closely agrees with this metatarsal\r\nbone of the Macrauchene, in the structure just alluded to: the\r\narticulation with the middle metatarsal being by a single sub-oval\r\nfacet, which stands out a little way from the surface of the bone: the\r\narticular surface in the Macrauchene presents a similar form and\r\ncondition, and is similarly situated to that in the Palæothere, being at\r\nthe posterior part of the lateral surface, and a little below the\r\nsuperior or tarsal articular surface. The bone expands towards its\r\ndistal end, which corresponds in structure with those of the two lateral\r\nmetatarsals in the fore-foot, in being completely divided into two\r\ntrochlear surfaces by a well-developed median ridge, and in having the\r\nposterior half of this ridge suddenly produced, so as to project about\r\ntwo lines further from the trochlear surface than the anterior part of\r\nthe same ridge. In both the Tapir and Palæothere this anterior part of\r\nthe ridge is wholly suppressed, and the posterior is much more feebly\r\ndeveloped than in the Macrauchenia. The metatarsal bone here described\r\nis of exactly the same length with the internal metacarpal bone, and\r\nproves, in conjunction with the proportions of the astralagus, that the\r\nfore and hind-feet of the Macrauchenia were of equal size.\r\n\r\nThus then we obtain evidence, from a few mutilated bones of the trunk\r\nand extremities of a single representative of its race, that there once\r\nexisted in South America a Pachydermatous quadruped, not proboscidian,\r\nwhich equalled in stature the Rhinoceroses and Hippopotamuses of the old\r\nworld. But this, though an interesting and hitherto unsuspected fact, is\r\nfar from being the sum of the information which is yielded by these\r\nfossils. We have seen that the single ungueal phalanx bespeaks a\r\nquadruped of the great series of _Ungulata_, and this indication is\r\ncorroborated by the condition of the radius and ulna, which are fixed\r\nimmoveably in the prone position. Now in the Ungulated series there are\r\nbut two known genera,—the Rhinoceros and Palæotherium,—which, like the\r\nquadruped in question, have only three toes on the fore-foot. Again, in\r\nreferring the Macrauchenia to the Tridactyle family of Pachyderms, we\r\nfind, towards the close of our analysis, and by a detailed comparison of\r\nindividual bones, that the Macrauchenia has the closest affinity to the\r\nPalæotherium.\r\n\r\nBut the Palæotherium, like the Rhinoceros and Tapir, has the ulna\r\ndistinct from the radius, and the fibula from the tibia; so that even if\r\nthe Parisian Pachyderm had actually presented the same peculiarities of\r\nthe cervical vertebræ as the Patagonian one, it would have been\r\nhazardous, to say the least, while ignorant of the dentition of the\r\nlatter, to refer it to the genus _Palæotherium_.\r\n\r\nMost interesting, indeed will be the knowledge, whenever the means of\r\nobtaining it may arrive, of the structure of the skull and teeth in the\r\nMacrauchenia. Meanwhile, we cannot but recognise, in the anchylosed and\r\nconfluent state of the bones of the fore-arm and leg, a marked tendency\r\nin it towards the Ruminant Order, and the singular modifications of the\r\ncervical vertebræ have enabled us to point out the precise family of\r\nthat order, with which the Macrauchenia is more immediately allied.\r\n\r\nIn first demonstrating this relationship, it was shown in how many\r\nparticulars the _Camelidæ_, without losing the essential characters of\r\nRuminantia, manifested a tendency to the Pachydermatous type; and the\r\nevidence which the lost genera, _Macrauchenia_ and _Anoplotherium_, bear\r\nto a reciprocal transition from the Pachyderms to the Ruminants, through\r\nthe _Camelidæ_, cannot but be viewed with extreme interest by the\r\nZoologist engaged in the study of the natural affinities of the Animal\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Macrauchenia is not less valuable to the Geologist, in reference to\r\nthe geographical distribution of animal forms. It is well known how\r\nunlooked-for and unlikely was the announcement of the existence of an\r\nextinct quadruped entombed in the Paris Basin, whose closest affinities\r\nwere to a genus, (_Tapirus_,) at that time, regarded as exclusively\r\nSouth American. Still greater surprise was excited when a species of the\r\ngenus _Didelphys_ was discovered to have co-existed in Europe with the\r\n_Palæotherium_.\r\n\r\nNow, on the other hand, we find in South America, besides the Tapir,\r\nwhich is closely allied to the Palæothere,—and the Llama, to which the\r\nAnoplothere offers many traces of affinity,—the remains of an extinct\r\nPachyderm, nearly akin to the European genus _Palæotherium_: and,\r\nlastly, this Macrauchenia is itself in a remarkable degree a\r\ntransitional form, and manifests characters which connect it both with\r\nthe Tapir and the Llama.\r\n\r\n            ADMEASUREMENTS OF THE BONES OF THE MACRAUCHENIA.\r\n\r\n                                                         Inches.

In the present case, however, as in that\r\nof the Mammiferous animal whose fossil remains we were last considering,\r\nthe important organs, to which Cuvier directs our first attention, are\r\nwanting. Nor are there here, as in the Macrauchenia, any remains of the\r\nlocomotive extremities to compensate for the deficiency of teeth, and\r\nguide us into the right track of investigation and comparison. The\r\nanimal, the nature and affinities of which are the subject of the\r\nfollowing pages, is, in fact, represented in Mr. Darwin’s collection, by\r\nnothing more than a fragment of the cranium.\r\n\r\nThis fragment, which was found in the bed of the same river, (see p.\r\n16,) in Banda Oriental, with the cranium of the Toxodon, includes the\r\nparietes of the left side of the cerebral cavity, the corresponding\r\nnervous and vascular foramina, the left occipital condyle, a portion of\r\nthe left zygomatic process, and, fortunately also, the left articular\r\nsurface for the lower jaw. The importance of this surface in the\r\ndetermination of the affinities of a fossil animal has been duly\r\nappreciated, since the relations of the motions of the lower jaw to the\r\nkind of life of each animal were pointed out by Cuvier; but yet we\r\nshould be deceived were we to establish, in conformity with the\r\ngeneralization enunciated by Cuvier,[29] our conclusion, from this\r\nsurface, of the nature of the food of the extinct species under\r\nconsideration; for the glenoid cavity is so shaped as to allow the lower\r\njaw free motion in a horizontal plane, from right to left, and forwards\r\nor backwards, like the movements of a mill-stone; and, nevertheless, I\r\nventure to affirm it to be most probable, that the food of\r\n_Glossotherium_ was derived from the animal and not from the vegetable\r\nkingdom; and to predict, that when the bones of the extremities shall be\r\ndiscovered, they will prove the Glossothere to be not an ungulate but an\r\nunguiculate quadruped, with a fore-foot endowed with the movements of\r\npronation and supination, and armed with claws, adapted to make a breach\r\nin the strong walls of the habitations of those insect-societies, upon\r\nwhich there is good evidence in other parts of the present cranial\r\nfragment, that the animal, though as large as an ox, was adapted to\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nWe perceive, in the first place, looking upon the base of this portion\r\nof skull, a remarkable cavity, situated immediately behind the tympanic\r\nbone, of nearly a regular hemispherical form, an inch in diameter (fig.\r\n2, _b_, Pl. XVI). The superficies of this cavity appears not to have\r\nbeen covered with articular cartilage, for it is irregularly pitted with\r\nmany deep impressions; and I conclude, therefore, that it served to\r\nafford a ligamentous attachment to the styloid element of a large _os\r\nhyoides_. With this indication of the size of the skeleton of the\r\ntongue, is combined a more certain proof of the extent of its soft, and\r\nespecially its muscular parts, in the magnitude of the foramen, for the\r\npassage of the lingual or motor nerve (_c._ fig. 2 and 3). This foramen,\r\n(the anterior condyloid,) in the present specimen, is the largest of\r\nthose which perforate the walls of the cranium, with the exception of\r\nthe foramen magnum; it is fully twice the size of that which gives\r\npassage to the second division of the fifth nerve; its area is oval, and\r\neight lines in the long diameter, so that it readily admits the passage\r\nof the little finger.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the Ant-eaters and Pangolins that we find an approximation\r\nto these proportions of the foramen for the passage of the muscular\r\nnerve of the tongue; and the existing Myrmecophagous species even fall\r\nshort of the larger fossil in this respect. Some idea of the size of the\r\nlingual nerve, and of the organ it was destined to put in motion, may be\r\nformed, when it is stated that the foramen giving passage to the\r\ncorresponding nerve in the Giraffe,—the largest of the Ruminants, and\r\nhaving the longest and most muscular tongue in that order,—is scarcely\r\nmore than one-fourth the size.\r\n\r\nWith these indications of the extraordinary development of the tongue,\r\nwe are naturally led, in order to carry out a closer and more detailed\r\ncomparison of the fossil in question, to that group of mammalia in which\r\nthe tongue plays the chief part in the acquisition of the food. The\r\nsize, form, and position of the occipital condyle,—the magnitude of the\r\noccipital foramen, (which must here have somewhat exceeded three inches\r\nin the transverse diameter,)—the slope of the occipital surface of the\r\ncranium from below, upwards and forwards, at an angle of 60° with the\r\nbase of the cranial cavity-each and all attest the close affinities of\r\nthe present animal to the Edentata. More decisive evidence of the same\r\nrelationship will be adduced from the organization of other parts of the\r\ncranium. The glenoid articular surface (_a_, fig. 2, Pl. XVI.) is an\r\nalmost flattened plane, wider in the transverse than in the longitudinal\r\ndirection; and, as in the genera _Myrmecophaga_ and _Manis_, it is not\r\ndefended behind by any descending process. In its general form it\r\nresembles the glenoid cavity of _Orycteropus_ more than that of the\r\npreceding Edentates; but, in _Orycteropus_, the articulation is defended\r\nposteriorly by a descending process of the zygoma, and it is also\r\nsituated relatively closer to the os tympanicum.\r\n\r\nHad the _Glossotherium_ teeth? The extent of the temporal muscle, which\r\nis indicated by the rugged surface of the temporal fossa, and by the\r\nwell-marked boundary, formed by a slightly elevated bony ridge, which\r\nextends to near the line of the sagittal suture, together with the size\r\nof the zygomatic portion of the temporal bone, and the remains of the\r\noblique suture by which it was articulated to the malar bone, enables me\r\nto answer this question confidently in the affirmative. They will\r\nprobably be found to be molar teeth of a simple structure, as in the\r\nOrycteropus.\r\n\r\nThe evidence just alluded to of the existence of an os malæ is\r\ninteresting, because this bone is wanting in the Pangolins; and its\r\nrudimental representative in the true Ant-eaters does not reach the\r\nzygomatic process of the temporal bone, which consequently has no\r\narticular or sutural surface at its anterior extremity. In the presence,\r\ntherefore, of the surface for the junction of the os malæ, and the\r\nconsequent evidence of the completion of the zygomatic arch, we learn\r\nthat the Glossothere was more nearly allied to the Armadillos and\r\nOrycterope. That its affinity to the latter genus was closer than to the\r\nArmadillos we have most interesting evidence in the form and loose\r\ncondition of the tympanic bone: it is represented of the natural size at\r\nfig. 4, Pl. XVI. Through the care and attention devoted to his specimens\r\nby their gifted discoverer, this bone was preserved _in situ_, as\r\nrepresented at _d_, fig. 1; but it had no osseous connection with the\r\npetrous or other elements of the temporal bone, and could be displaced\r\nand replaced with the same ease as in the _Orycterope_. This bony frame\r\nof the membrana tympani, in the Glossothere, describes rather more than\r\na semicircle, having the horns directed upwards; it has a groove, one\r\nline in breadth, along its concave margin, for the attachment of the\r\near-drum, and sends down a rugged process, half an inch long, from its\r\nlower margin. In the _Dasypodes_ and _Myrmecophagæ_, the tympanic bone\r\nsoon becomes anchylosed with the other parts of the temporal; it is only\r\nin _Orycteropus_, among the existing insectivorous _Bruta_ or\r\n_Edentata_, that it manifests throughout life the fœtal condition of a\r\ndistinct bony hoop, deficient at the upper part. The os tympanicum of\r\n_Orycteropus_, however, differs from that of _Glossotherium_, in forming\r\npart of the circumference of an ellipse, whose long axis is vertical;\r\nand in sending outwards, from its anterior part, a convex eminence,\r\nwhich terminates in a point directed downwards and forwards.\r\n\r\nSuch appear to be the most characteristic features of the cranial\r\nfragment under consideration, in which we have found, that the articular\r\nsurface for the os hyoides throws more light upon the nature of the\r\nanimal of which it is a part, than even the glenoid cavity itself. There\r\nnow remains to be described as much of the individual characters of the\r\nconstituent bones as the specimen exhibits.\r\n\r\nThe occipital bone, besides forming the posterior and part of the\r\ninferior parietes of the cranium, extends for about half an inch upon\r\nthe sides, where the ex-occipital element is articulated by a vertical\r\nsuture with the mastoid element of the temporal: this suture is situated\r\nin a deep and well-marked muscular depression (_e_, fig. 1), measuring\r\nthree inches in the vertical, and upwards of one inch in the transverse\r\ndirection. The other sutures, uniting the occipital to the adjoining\r\nbones, are obliterated. The breadth of the occipital region must have\r\nexceeded the height of the same by about one-third. The condyle extends\r\nnearly to the external boundary of the occipital aspect of the cranium;\r\nthere is situated, external to it, only a small ovate, rounded and\r\nsmooth protuberance. The slightly concave surface of the occipital plane\r\nof the cranium is bounded above by a thick obtuse ridge, the muscular\r\nimpressions are well sculptured upon it. It is traversed transversely at\r\nits upper third by a slightly elevated bony crest; and the surface below\r\nthis ridge is again divided by a narrower intermuscular crest, which\r\nruns nearly vertically, at about an inch and a half from the external\r\nboundary of the occipital plane. As a similar crest must have existed on\r\nthe opposite side, the general character of the occipital surface in the\r\nGlossothere would resemble that of the Toxodon. A similar correspondence\r\nmay be noticed in the terminal position of the condyle, and the slope of\r\nthe occipital plane.\r\n\r\nAbove the transverse ridge, the rough surface of the occipital plane\r\nslopes forward, at a less obtuse angle with the basal plane, to the\r\nfirst named ridge which separates the occipital from the coronal or\r\nsuperior surface of the skull. The contour of this surface runs\r\nforwards, as far as the fragment extends, in an almost straight line:\r\nthe extent of surface between the temporal muscular ridges must have\r\nbeen about five inches posteriorly, but it decreases gradually as it\r\nextends forwards: all that part which is preserved is quite smooth. The\r\nattachment of the fasciculi of the temporal muscle, and the convergence\r\nof their fibres as they passed through the zygoma are well-marked on the\r\nsculptured surface of the bone. The zygomatic process is relatively\r\nstouter than in _Orycteropus_: it is prismatic: the external facet is\r\nnearly plane: the superior is concave, and increases in breadth\r\nanteriorly: the inferior surface offers a slight convexity behind the\r\nflattened articular surface for the lower jaw. The margin of the zygoma\r\nformed by the meeting of the upper and lower facets presents a\r\nsemicircular curve, extended transversely from the cranium, and directed\r\nforwards.\r\n\r\nThe anterior extremity is obliquely truncated from below upwards and\r\nforwards, and presents a flattened triangular surface indicative of its\r\njunction with an os malæ: the space between this extremity and the side\r\nof the cranium measures one inch and nine lines across, and thus gives\r\nus the thickness of the temporal muscle. The distance from the origin of\r\nthe zygoma to the occipital plane is relatively greater than in\r\n_Orycteropus_; _Glossotherium_ is in this respect more similar to\r\n_Myrmecophaga_ and _Manis_.\r\n\r\nThe sphenoid bone forms a somewhat smooth protuberance below and behind\r\nthe base of the _zygoma_. The tympanic bone is wedged in between this\r\nprotuberance in front, and the mastoid process behind. The chief\r\npeculiarity of the broad mastoid is the regular semicircular cavity at\r\nits under part for the articulation of the styloid bone of the tongue.\r\nThis depression is separated below by a broad rough protuberance from\r\nthe foramen jugulare, (_f_, fig. 2, Pl. XVI,) which is immediately\r\nexternal to, and slightly in advance of the great foramen condyloideum,\r\n_c_. A small rugged portion of the os petrosum separates the jugular\r\nfrom the carotid canal, which arches upwards and directly inwards to the\r\nside of the shallow sella turcica, (the external and internal orifices\r\nof the carotid canal are shown at _g_, figs. 2 and 3). The chief\r\nprotuberance on the basis cranii is a large and rugged one, serving for\r\nthe attachment of muscles, and due chiefly to the expansion of a great\r\nsinus in the body of the sphenoid. This protuberance is separated from\r\nthe smaller sphenoid protuberance before mentioned by a large groove\r\ncontinued downwards and forwards from the tympanic cavity, and\r\ncontaining the Eustachian tube, which does not traverse a complete\r\nosseous canal. Immediately internal to the glenoid cavity is the large\r\norifice of the canal transmitting the third division of the fifth pair\r\nof nerves, the principal branch of which endows the tongue with\r\nsensibility; this foramen (_h_, fig. 2) is rather less than that for the\r\nmuscular nerve of the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe internal surface of the present cranial fragment affords a very\r\nsatisfactory idea of the size and shape of the brain of the extinct\r\nspecies to which it belongs. It is evident that, as in other Bruta, the\r\ncerebellum must have been almost entirely exposed behind the cerebrum;\r\nand that the latter was of small relative size, not exceeding that of\r\nthe Ass; and chiefly remarkable, as in the Orycterope, Ant-eater, and\r\nArmadillo for the great development of the olfactory ganglia. The\r\nantero-posterior extent of the cribriform plate, as exposed in this\r\nfragment, is three inches, and the complication of the œthmoid olfactory\r\nlamellæ which radiate from it into the nasal cavity is equal to that\r\nwhich exists in the smaller Edentata (fig. 3, Pl. XVI). The nasal cavity\r\nis complicated in _Glossotherium_ by the great number and capacious size\r\nof the air-cells which are in communication with it: these extend over\r\nall the upper, lateral, and back parts of the cranial cavity, as far\r\neven as the upper boundary of the foramen magnum: they also occupy the\r\nanterior two-thirds of the basis cranii. The external configuration of\r\nthe skull would, therefore, afford a very inadequate or rather deceptive\r\nnotion of the capacity of the cerebral cavity, were not the existence\r\nand magnitude of these sinuses known. The interspace of the outer and\r\ninner tables of the cranium are separated above the origins of the\r\nolfactory ganglia for the extent of three inches: above the middle of\r\nthe cerebrum they are an inch and a half apart; at the sides of the\r\ncranium the interposed air-cells are from one to two inches across; at\r\nthe back part of the cranium about one inch. The sinuses have generally\r\na rounded form.\r\n\r\nThe foramen rotundum, (through which in figure 3 a probe is represented\r\nas passing), and the foramen ovale are situated close together, within a\r\ncommon transversely oblong depression (_i_). The carotid canal (_g_)\r\nopens into the outer side of the commencement of this wide channel,\r\nwhich conducts the great fifth pair of nerves to the outlets of its two\r\nchief divisions.\r\n\r\nThe petrous bone projects into the cranial cavity, in the form of an\r\nangular process with three facets: the foramen auditorium internum\r\n(_k_), and the aqueductus vestibuli, are situated on the posterior\r\nfacet. Immediately behind the os petrosum is the foramen lacerum\r\njugulare (_l_), situated at the point of convergence of the vertical\r\ngroove of the lateral sinus, with a groove of similar size continued\r\nforwards from above the anterior condyloid canal. The plane of the\r\ninternal opening of this canal (_c_, fig. 3) is directed obliquely\r\ninwards and backwards, and the lateral wall of the foramen magnum behind\r\nthe foramen condyloideum slopes outwards to the edge of the condyle.\r\nImmediately internal to the foramen condyloideum is a small vascular\r\nforamen conducting a branch of the basilar artery into the condyloid\r\ncanal, for the nourishment, doubtless, of the great lingual nerve.\r\n\r\nIn the relations of the plane of the internal orifice of the anterior\r\ncondyloid foramen with that of the foramen magnum, we search in vain for\r\na corresponding structure in any of the Mammiferous orders, save the\r\nEdentata:[30] and among these the Orycterope comes nearest the\r\nGlossothere in this respect. In the degree of development of the\r\ninternal osseous ridge giving attachment to the tentorium cerebelli, the\r\nAnt-eaters and Armadillos more resemble the Glossothere than does the\r\nOrycterope; in which a continuous bony plate arches across the cranial\r\ncavity: in the Manis a still greater proportion of the tentorium is\r\nossified, and it consequently recedes the furthest amongst the Edentata,\r\nin this, as in most other particulars of the cranial organization, from\r\nthe Glossothere. The chief distinctive peculiarity in the cranium of the\r\nGlossothere, so far as it can be studied in the present fragment, and\r\ncompared with that of other Edentata, is the deep, well-marked,\r\nsemicircular styloid depression, above described.\r\n\r\n\r\nA question may arise after perusing the preceding evidence, upon which\r\nthe present fossil is referred to a great Edentate species nearly allied\r\nto the _Orycteropus_, whether one or other of the lower jaws,\r\nsubsequently to be described, and in like manner referable, from their\r\ndentition, either to the _Orycteropodoid_ or _Dasypodoid_ families of\r\nEdentata, may not have belonged to the same species as does the present\r\nmutilated cranium. I can only answer, that those jaws were discovered by\r\nMr. Darwin in a different and very remote locality,—that no fragments or\r\nteeth referable to them were found associated with the present fossil;\r\nand that, as it would be, therefore, impossible to determine from the\r\nevidence we have now before us, which of the two lower jaws should be\r\nassociated with _Glossotherium_; and as both may with equal if not\r\ngreater probability belong to a totally distinct genus, it appears to me\r\nto be preferable, both in regard to the advancement of our knowledge of\r\nthese most interesting Edentata of an ancient world, as well as for the\r\nconvenience of their description, to assign to them, for the present,\r\ndistinct generic appellations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figures in Plate XVI. preclude the necessity of a table of\r\nadmeasurements of the cranial fragment of _Glossotherium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n DESCRIPTION OF A MUTILATED LOWER JAW AND TEETH, ON WHICH IS FOUNDED A\r\n          SUBGENUS OF MEGATHERIOID EDENTATA, UNDER THE NAME OF\r\n                                MYLODON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genus _Megalonyx_, as is well known, owes its name and the discovery\r\nof the fossil remains on which it was founded, to the celebrated\r\nJefferson,[31] formerly President of the United States. Cuvier, from an\r\nexamination of a single tooth, and the casts of certain bones of the\r\nextremities, especially the terminal ones, determined the ordinal\r\naffinities of this remarkable extinct quadruped.[32] But while he\r\nretained, the name of _Megalonyx_, and used it in a generic sense,\r\nCuvier offered no characters whereby other fossil remains might be\r\ngenerically either distinguished from, or identified with the _Megalonyx\r\nJeffersonii_, unless, among such remains there happened to be a tooth,\r\nor a claw exactly corresponding with the descriptions and figures in the\r\n_Ossemens Fossiles_; and when, of course, a specific identity, and not\r\nmerely a generic relationship would be established.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Cuvier’s chapter on _Megalonyx_ is devoted to the\r\nbeautiful and justly celebrated reasoning on the ungueal phalanx,\r\nwhereby it is proved to belong, not to a gigantic Carnivore of the\r\nLion-kind, as Jefferson supposed, but to the less formidable order of\r\nEdentate quadrupeds; and Cuvier, in reference to the tooth,—the part on\r\nwhich alone a generic character could have been founded,—merely observes\r\nthat it resembles at least as much the teeth of one of the great\r\nArmadillos, as it does those of the Sloths.[33]\r\n\r\nIn the last edition of the _Rêgne Animal_, Cuvier introduces the\r\n_Megatherium_ and _Megalonyx_, between the Sloths and Armadillos; but\r\nalludes to no other difference between the two genera than that of\r\nsize,—“l’autre, le _Megalonyx_, est un peu moindre.” (p. 226.) Some\r\nsystematic naturalists, as Desmarest, and Fischer, have, therefore,\r\nsuppressed the genus, and made the _Megalonyx_ a species of\r\n_Megatherium_ under the name of _Megatherium Jeffersonii_. The dental\r\ncharacters of the genus _Megatherium_ are laid down by Fischer[34] as\r\nfollows:—“_Dent. prim, et lan. ⁰⁄₀., molar es ⁴⁄₄⁴⁄₄, obducti, tritores,\r\ncoronide nunc planâ transversim sulcatâ nunc medio excavatâ marginibus\r\nprominulis._” That _Megalonyx_ had the same number of molares as\r\n_Megatherium_, (supposing that number in the Megathere to be correctly\r\nstated, which it is not,) is here assumed from analogy, for neither\r\nJefferson, Wistar, nor Cuvier,—the authorities for _Megalonyx_ quoted by\r\nFischer—possessed other means of knowing the dentition of that animal\r\nthan were afforded by the fragment of a single tooth.\r\n\r\nNow the almost entire lower jaw about to be described offers, in so far\r\nas respects the general form and structure of the teeth, the same kind\r\nand degree of correspondence with the _Megatherium_, as does the\r\n_Megalonyx Jeffersonii_ of Cuvier: and, what is only probable in that\r\nspecies, is here certain, viz., an agreement with the Megatherium in the\r\nclass, viz. _molares_, to which the teeth exclusively belong. The\r\nquestion, therefore, on which I find myself, in the outset, called upon\r\nto come to a decision is, as to the preference of the mode of viewing\r\nthe subject of the generic relationship of the _Megalonyx_ adopted by\r\nDesmarest, Fischer, &c., or of that, on which Cuvier, and after him Dr.\r\nHarlan, have practically acted: whether, in short, the genus\r\n_Megatherium_ is to rest upon the more comprehensive characters of kind\r\nand general structure of the teeth, or upon the more restricted ones, of\r\nform and such modifications in the disposition and proportions of the\r\ncomponent textures of the tooth, as give rise to the characteristic\r\nappearances of the triturating surface of the crown.\r\n\r\nWith respect to existing Mammalia, most naturalists of the present day\r\nseem to be unanimous as to the convenience at least of founding a\r\ngeneric or subgeneric distinction on well-marked modifications in the\r\nform and structure of the teeth, although they may correspond in number\r\nand kind, in proof of which it needs only to peruse the pages of a\r\n_Systema Mammalium_ which relate to the distribution of the Rodent\r\nOrder. According to this mode of viewing the logical abstractions under\r\nwhich species are grouped together, the extinct Edentate Mammal\r\ndiscovered by Jefferson must be referred to a genus distinct from\r\n_Megatherium_, and for which the term _Megalonyx_ should be retained.\r\nThis will be sufficiently evident by comparing the descriptions given by\r\nCuvier of one of the teeth of the _Megalonyx Jeffersonii_, and by Dr.\r\nHarlan of a tooth of his _Megalonyx laqueatus_, with those of the\r\n_Megatherium_ which have been published by Mr. Clift. The fragment of\r\nthe molar tooth of the _Megalonyx Jeffersonii_, described and figured in\r\nthe _Ossemens Fossiles_, seems to have been implanted in the jaw, like\r\nthe teeth of the _Megatherium_, by a simple hollow base similar in form\r\nand size to the protruded crown: its structure Cuvier describes as\r\nconsisting of a central cylinder of bone enveloped in a sheath of\r\nenamel.[35] The transverse section of this tooth presents an irregular\r\nelliptical form, the external contour being gently and uniformly convex,\r\nthe internal one, undulating; convex in the middle, and slightly concave\r\non each side, arising from the tooth being traversed longitudinally on\r\nits inner side by two wide and shallow depressions.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect tooth of the species called by Dr. Harlan _Megalonyx\r\nlaqueatus_, and of which a cast was presented by that able and\r\nindustrious naturalist to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons,\r\nresembles in general form, and especially in the characteristic double\r\nlongitudinal groove on the inner side, the tooth of the _Megalonyx\r\nJeffersonii_. It is thus described by Dr. Harlan:\r\n\r\n“The fractured molar tooth appears to have belonged to the inferior\r\nmaxilla on the right side; the crown is destroyed; a part of the cavity\r\nof the root remains. The body is compressed transversely, and presents a\r\ndouble curvature, which renders its anterior and exterior aspects\r\nslightly convex; the posterior and interior gently concave; these\r\nsurfaces are all uniform, with the exception of the interior or mesial\r\naspect, which presents a longitudinal rib or ridge, one-half the\r\nthickness of the long diameter of the tooth; with a broad, not profound\r\nlongitudinal groove or channel along each of its borders. It is from\r\nthis resemblance to a portion of a fluted column, that the animal takes\r\nits specific appellation (_Meg^x. laqueatus_).\r\n\r\n“The crown would resemble an irregular ellipsis widest at the anterior\r\nportion. The tooth consists of a central pillar of bone surrounded with\r\nenamel, the former of a dead white, the latter of a ferruginous brown\r\ncolour: the transverse diameter is more than two-thirds less than its\r\nlength, whilst that of _Meg^x. Jeffersonii_ is only one-third less—the\r\nantero-posterior diameter is one-half its length in the former, and\r\ntwo-thirds less in the latter. The proportions of this tooth are\r\nconsequently totally at variance with that of its kindred species.”\r\n[Vide Pl. XII. fig. 7, 8, 9.][36]\r\n\r\nDr. Harlan describes also two claws of the fore-foot, a radius, humerus,\r\nscapula, one rib, an os calcis, a metacarpal bone, certain vertebræ, a\r\nfemur, and tibia, of the same _Megalonyx_; these parts of the skeleton,\r\ntogether with the tooth, which so fortunately served to establish the\r\ngeneric relationship of the species with the _Megalonyx_ of Jefferson\r\nand Cuvier, were discovered in Big-bone-cave, Tennessee, United States.\r\n\r\nDr. Harlan does not enter into the question of the generic characters of\r\n_Megalonyx_, but it would seem that he felt them to rest not entirely on\r\ndental modifications, for he observes that “a minute examination of the\r\ntooth and knee-joint renders it not improbable, supposing the last named\r\ncharacter to be peculiar to it, that if the whole frame should hereafter\r\nbe discovered, it may even claim a generic distinction, in which case,\r\neither Aulaxodon, or PLEURODON, would not be an inappropriate name.”[37]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, as it appears to me, with respect to a fossil jaw\r\npresenting teeth in the same number, and of the same general structure,\r\nas in the _Megatherium_, and with individual modifications of form, as\r\nwell-marked as those which distinguish _Megatherium_ from _Megalonyx_,\r\nthat the Palæontologist has no other choice than to refer it, either as\r\nFischer has done with _Megalonyx_, to a distinct species of the genus\r\n_Megatherium_, or to regard it as the type of a subgenus distinct from\r\nboth. With reference, however, to the _Pleurodon_ of Dr. Harlan, after a\r\ndetailed comparison of the cast of the tooth on which that genus is\r\nmainly founded, with the descriptions and figures of the tooth of the\r\n_Megalonyx Jeffersonii_, in the “Ossemens Fossiles,” they seem to differ\r\nin so slight a degree as to warrant only a specific distinction, and\r\nthis difference even, viewing the various proportions of the teeth in\r\nthe same jaw of the _Megatherium_, is more satisfactorily established by\r\nthe characters pointed out by Dr. Harlan in the form and proportions of\r\nthe radius, than by those in the tooth itself.\r\n\r\nThe next notice of the _Megalonyx_ which I have consulted, in the hope\r\nof meeting with additional and more precise information as to its real\r\ngeneric characters, is an account given by the learned Professor\r\nDoellinger,[38] of some fossil bones, collected by the accomplished\r\ntravellers Spix and Martius in the cave of Lassa Grande, near the\r\nArrayal de Torracigos, in Brazil. In this collection, however, it\r\nunfortunately happens that there are no teeth, but only a few bones of\r\nthe extremities, including some ungueal phalanges, which Professor\r\nDoellinger concludes, from their shape, the presence of an osseous\r\nsheath for the claw, and the form of their articulation, to belong,\r\nwithout doubt, to an animal of the Megatherioid kind, about the size of\r\nan Ox. He particularly states that they are not bones of an immature\r\nindividual; but that they agree sufficiently with Cuvier’s descriptions\r\nand figures of the _Megalonyx_ to be referred to that species of animal\r\n(zu dieses thierart;) and he adds, what is certainly an interesting\r\nfact, that the fossils in question form the first of the kind that had\r\nbeen discovered out of North America.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the discovery of these bones, and of those of the\r\n_Megalonyx laqueatus_ above alluded to, the remains of another great\r\nEdentate animal were found in North America, and were deposited in the\r\nLyceum at New York; among these is a portion of the lower jaw with the\r\nwhole dental series of one side. It is thus described by Dr. Harlan.\r\n\r\n“The fragment I am now about to describe is a portion of the dexter\r\nlower jaw of the Megalonyx, containing four molar teeth; three of the\r\ncrowns of these teeth are perfect, that of the anterior one is\r\nimperfect. These teeth differ considerably from each other in shape, and\r\nincrease in size from the front, the fourth and posterior tooth being\r\ndouble the size of the first, and more compressed laterally; it is also\r\nvertically concave on its external aspect, and vertically convex on its\r\ninternal aspect; the interior or mesial surface is strongly fluted, and\r\nit has a deep longitudinal furrow on the dermal aspect, in which respect\r\nit differs from the tooth of the _M. laqueatus_ previously described by\r\nme, of which the dermal aspect is uniform, but to which, in all other\r\nrespects, it has a close resemblance. I suppose it therefore probable,\r\nthat this last may have belonged to the upper jaw. The three anterior\r\nmolars differ in shape and markings: they are vertically grooved, or\r\nfluted, on their interior and posterior aspects, a transverse section\r\npresenting an irregular cube. The length of the crown of the posterior\r\nmolar is two inches: the breadth about five-tenths of an inch: the\r\nlength of the tooth is three inches and six-tenths. The diameter of the\r\npenultimate molar is eight-tenths by seven-tenths of an inch. The length\r\nof this fragment of the jaw-bone is eight inches and four-tenths; the\r\nheight three inches and six-tenths: the length of the space occupied by\r\nthe alveolar sockets five inches and eight-tenths. The crown of the\r\ntooth presents no protuberances, but resembles that of the Sloth; the\r\nroots are hollow.”[39]\r\n\r\nThis fossil is referred by Dr. Harlan to his _Megalonyx laqueatus_; but,\r\npending the absence of other proof of the identity of species, in which,\r\nas may be seen by comparing fig. 2, with fig. 4, in Pl. XVII., the teeth\r\ndiffer widely in form, it would be obviously hazardous to adopt such an\r\napproximation on hypothetical grounds.[40] In order, however, to obtain\r\nmore satisfactory evidence of the nature and amount of the difference\r\nbetween the _Megalonyx laqueatus_, and the allied animal represented by\r\nthe above-described fragment of lower jaw, I wrote to my much respected\r\nfriend M. LAURILLARD, requesting him to send me a sketch of the teeth in\r\nthe cast of that lower jaw, which had been transmitted from New York to\r\nthe Garden of Plants. With full confidence in the characteristic\r\nprecision and accuracy of the drawing with which I have been obligingly\r\nfavoured by M. Laurillard, I am disposed to regard the amount of\r\ndifference recognizable in every tooth in the lower jaw in question\r\n(fig, 3 and 4,) as compared with the molar tooth either of _Megalonyx\r\nJeffersonii_ (fig. 1,) or _Meg^x. laqueatus_ (fig. 2) to be such as to\r\njustify its generic separation from _Megalonyx_ on the same grounds as\r\n_Megalonyx_ is distinguished from _Megatherium_, and for the subgenus of\r\nMegatherioid Edentata, thus indicated, I would propose the name of\r\nMYLODON.[41] The species of which the fossil remains are described by\r\nDr. Harlan may be dedicated to that indefatigable Naturalist who has\r\ncontributed to natural science so much valuable information respecting\r\nthe Zoology, both recent and fossil, of the North American continent.\r\nThe fossil about to be described represents a second and smaller species\r\nof the same genus, and I propose to call it _Mylodon Darwinii_, in\r\nhonour of its discoverer, of whose researches in the Southern division\r\nof the New World it forms one of many new and interesting fruits.\r\n\r\nThis fossil was discovered in a bed of partly consolidated gravel at the\r\nbase of the cliff called Punta Alta, at Bahia Blanca in Northern\r\nPatagonia: it consists of the lower jaw with the series of teeth entire\r\non both sides: but the extremity of the symphysis, the coronoid and\r\ncondyloid processes, and the angular process of the left ramus, are\r\nwanting. The teeth are composed, as in _Bradypus_, _Megatherium_ and\r\n_Megalonyx_, of a central pillar of coarse ivory, immediately invested\r\nwith a thin layer of fine and dense ivory, and the whole surrounded by a\r\nthick coating of cement.\r\n\r\nIn the fig. 5, Pl. XVII., the fine ivory is represented by the white\r\nstriated concentric tract on the grinding surface of the teeth; it is of\r\na yellowish-white colour in the fossil, and stands out, as an obtuse\r\nridge, from that surface: both these conditions depend on the large\r\nproportion of the mineral to the animal constituent in this substance of\r\nthe tooth. The external layer of the cement presents in the fossil the\r\nsame yellowish-brown tint as the bone itself, which it so closely\r\nresembles, both in intimate structure and in chemical composition; the\r\ninternal layer next the dense ivory is jet black, indicating the great\r\nproportion of animal matter originally present in this part. The central\r\npillar of coarse ivory, which, from its more yielding texture, has been\r\nworn down into a hollow at the triturating surface of the tooth, also\r\npresents, as a consequence of the less proportion of the hardening\r\nphosphates, a darker brown colour than the external layer of the cement,\r\nor the bone itself.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are implanted in very deep sockets; about one-sixth only of\r\nthe last molar projects above the alveolus; the proportion of the\r\nexposed part of the tooth increases as they are placed further forwards.\r\nThe implanted part of each tooth is simple; preserving the same size and\r\nform as the projecting crown, and presenting a large conical cavity at\r\nthe base, indicative of the original persistent pulp, and perpetual\r\ngrowth of these teeth.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the whole four alveoli is four inches, eight lines; the\r\nlength of the jaw from the angle to the broken end of the symphysis is\r\nseventeen inches and a half;[42] from the figures it will be seen that\r\nonly a small proportion of the anterior part of the jaw is lost, so that\r\nwe may regard the dentigerous part of the jaw as being limited to about\r\none-fourth of its entire length; the alveoli being nearly equidistant\r\nfrom the two extremities. The first and second teeth, counting\r\nbackwards, are separated by an interspace of rather more than three\r\nlines; that between the second and third is one line less; the third and\r\nfourth are rather more than a line apart: from the oblique position,\r\nhowever, of the three hinder teeth the intervals between them appear in\r\na side view, as in fig. 1, Pl. XIX., to be less than in reality, and the\r\nthird and fourth teeth seem to touch each other.\r\n\r\nEach tooth has a form and size peculiar to itself, and different from\r\nthe rest, but corresponds of course with its fellow on the opposite\r\nside. The same may be observed, but in a less degree, in the teeth of\r\nthe Megatherium itself; hence, it is obviously hazardous to found a\r\ngeneric distinction upon a single tooth, unless, as in the case of the\r\n_Glyptodon_,[43] the modification of form happens to be extremely\r\nwell-marked. The whole series of teeth, or their sockets, at least of\r\none of the jaws, should be known for the purpose of making a\r\nsatisfactory comparison with the previously established Edentate genera.\r\n\r\nThe first molar in the present jaw is the smallest and simplest of the\r\nseries: its transverse section is ellipsoid, or subovate, narrowest in\r\nfront, and somewhat more convex on the outer than on the inner side: the\r\nlong diameter of the ellipse is nine lines, the short or transverse\r\ndiameter six lines: the length of the tooth may be about three inches,\r\nbut I have not deemed it necessary to fracture the alveolus in order to\r\nascertain precisely this point.\r\n\r\nThe second tooth presents in transverse section a more irregular and\r\nwider oval figure than the first: the line of the outer side is convex,\r\nbut that of the inner side slightly concave, in consequence of the tooth\r\nbeing traversed longitudinally by a broad and shallow channel or\r\nimpression; the longitudinal diameter of the transverse section is one\r\ninch; the transverse diameter at the widest part nine lines. There is a\r\nslight difference in the size of this tooth on the two sides of the jaw,\r\nthe right one, from which the above dimensions are taken, being the\r\nlargest.\r\n\r\nThe transverse section of the third tooth has a trapezoidal or\r\nrhomboidal form; the angles are rounded off; the posterior one is most\r\nproduced; the anterior and posterior surfaces are flattened, the latter\r\nslightly concave in the middle; the external and internal sides are\r\nconcave in the middle, especially the inner side, where the concavity\r\napproaches to the form of an entering notch. The longest diameter of the\r\ntransverse section of this tooth is thirteen lines, the shortest seven\r\nlines and a half: in the tooth on the right side the external surface is\r\nnearly flat; this slight difference is not indicated in the figure (Pl.\r\nXVIII.)\r\n\r\nThe last molar, which is generally the most characteristic in the fossil\r\n_Bruta_, presents in an exaggerated degree the peculiarities of the\r\npreceding tooth; the longitudinal channels on both the outer and inner\r\nsurfaces encroach so far upon the substance of the tooth, that the\r\ncentral coarse ivory substance is as it were squeezed out of the\r\ninterspace, and the elevated ridge of the dense ivory describes an\r\nhour-glass figure upon the triturating surface, the connecting isthmus\r\nbeing but half the breadth of the rest of the tract; the external\r\ncæmentum preserves nearly an equal thickness throughout. Of the two\r\nlobes into which this tooth is divided by the transverse constriction,\r\nthe anterior is the largest; their proportions and oblique position are\r\npretty accurately given in the figure. The longitudinal diameter of the\r\ntransverse section of this tooth is one inch, seven lines, its greatest\r\nlateral or transverse diameter is ten lines, its least diameter at the\r\nconstricted part is three lines, the length of the entire tooth is four\r\ninches. Judging from the form of the jaw, the length of the other teeth\r\ndecreases in a regular ratio to the anterior one. The posterior tooth is\r\nslightly curved, as shown in fig. 2, Pl. XIX., with the concavity\r\ndirected towards the outer side of the jaw.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the horizontal ramus of the jaw, is so well\r\nillustrated in the figures Pl. XVIII. and XIX., that the description may\r\nbe brief.\r\n\r\nThe symphysis is completely anchylosed, about four inches in length, and\r\nextended forward to the extremity of the jaw at a very slight angle with\r\nthe inferior border of the ramus: it is of great breadth, smooth and\r\ngently concave internally, and suggests the idea of its adaptation for\r\nthe support and gliding movements forwards and backwards of the free\r\nextremity of a long and well-developed tongue.\r\n\r\nThe exterior surface of the symphysis is characterized by the presence\r\nof two oval mammilloid processes, situated on each side of the middle\r\nline, and about half-way between the anterior and posterior extremes of\r\nthe symphysis. A front view of these processes, of the natural size, is\r\ngiven in fig. 4, Pl. XIX.: a side view of the one on the right side\r\nrepresented in the reduced figure.\r\n\r\nNearly four inches behind the anterior extremity of the above process is\r\nthe large anterior opening of the dental canal: it is five lines in\r\ndiameter, situated about one-third of the depth of the ramus of the jaw\r\nfrom the upper margin. The magnitude of this foramen, which gives\r\npassage to the nerve and artery of the lower lip, indicates that this\r\npart was of large size; and the two symphyseal processes, which probably\r\nwere subservient to the attachment of large retractor muscles, denote\r\nthe free and extensive motions of such a lip, as we have presumed to\r\nhave existed from the size of the foramina destined for the transmission\r\nof its nervous and nutrient organs.\r\n\r\nThe angle of the jaw is produced backwards, and ends in an obtuse point,\r\nslightly bent upwards; a foramen, one-third less than the anterior one,\r\nleads from near the commencement of the dental canal, to the outer\r\nsurface of the jaw, a little below and behind the last molar tooth; this\r\nforamen presents the same size and relative position on both sides of\r\nthe jaw. I find no indication of a corresponding foramen, or of\r\nsymphyseal processes in the figures or descriptions of the lower jaw of\r\nthe Megatherium, nor in the lower jaw of the Sloths, Ant-eaters,\r\nArmadillos, or Manises, which I have had the opportunity of examining\r\nwith a view to this comparison.\r\n\r\nIn the Megatherium the inferior contour of the lower jaw is peculiarly\r\nremarkable, as Cuvier has observed, for the convex prominence or\r\nenlargement which is developed downwards from its middle part. In the\r\nMylodon the corresponding convexity exists in a very slight degree, not\r\nexceeding that which may be observed at the corresponding part of the\r\nlower jaw of the Ai, or Orycterope. A broad and shallow furrow extends\r\nalong the outer side of the jaw, close to the alveolar margin, from the\r\nbeginning of the coronoid process to the anterior dental foramen.\r\n\r\nThe base of the coronoid process begins external and posterior to the\r\nlast grinder: the whole of the ascending ramus of the jaw, beneath the\r\ncoronoid process is excavated on its inner side by a wide and deep\r\nconcavity, bounded below by a well-marked ridge, which extends obliquely\r\nbackwards from the posterior part of the alveolus of the last grinder to\r\nthe inferior margin of the ascending ramus, which is bent inwards before\r\nit reaches the angle of the jaw.\r\n\r\nThe large foramen or entry to the dental canal is situated in the\r\ninternal concavity of the ascending ramus of the jaw, two inches behind\r\nthe last molar, three inches from the lower margin of the ramus, and\r\nnearly five inches from the elevated angle of the jaw: it measures nine\r\nlines in the vertical diameter, and its magnitude indicates the large\r\nsize of the vessels which are destined to supply the materials for the\r\nconstant renewal of the dental substance,—a substance which from its\r\ntexture must be supposed to have been subject to rapid abrasion. About\r\nan inch behind the dental foramen a deep vascular groove, about two\r\nlines in breadth, is continued downwards to the ridge which\r\ncircumscribes the internal concavity of this part of the jaw, and\r\nperforates the ridge, which thus arches over the canal: this structure\r\nis present in both rami of the jaw. The mylo-hyoid ridge is distinctly\r\nmarked about an inch and a half below the alveolar margin. Other\r\nmuscular ridges and irregular eminences are present on the outer side of\r\nthe base of the ascending ramus, and near the angle of the jaw; as shown\r\nin fig. 1, Pl. XIX.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding descriptions it will be seen that the lower jaw of\r\nthe _Mylodon_ is very different from that of the _Megatherium_; with\r\nthat of the _Megalonyx_ we have at present no means of comparing it.\r\nAmong existing Edentata the Mylodon, in the form of the posterior part\r\nand angle of the jaw, holds an intermediate place between the Ai and the\r\ngreat Armadillo; in the form of the anchylosed symphysis of the lower\r\njaw it resembles most closely the Unau or two-toed Sloth; but in the\r\npeculiar external configuration of the symphysis resulting from the\r\nmammilloid processes above described, the Mylodon presents a character\r\nwhich has not hitherto been observed in any other species of _Bruta_,\r\neither recent or fossil.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be stated, that the teeth and bones here described\r\noffer all the conditions and appearances of those of a full grown\r\nanimal; and that they present a marked difference of size as compared\r\nwith those of the _Mylodon Harlani_, as will be evident by the following\r\nadmeasurements.\r\n\r\n               ADMEASUREMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW OF MYLODON DARWINII.\r\n\r\n                                                                   Inches.

The parts of the skeleton about to be described\r\nwere discovered in their natural relative position, as represented at\r\nPl. XX., indicating, Mr. Darwin observes, that the sublittoral formation\r\nin which they had been originally deposited had been subject to little\r\ndisturbance.[45] They include the cranium, nearly entire, with the teeth\r\nand part of the os hyoides; the seven cervical, eight of the dorsal, and\r\nfive of the sacral vertebræ, the two scapulæ, left humerus, radius and\r\nulna, two carpal bones, and an ungueal phalanx; both femora, the\r\nproximal extremities of the left tibia and fibula, and the left\r\nastragalus.\r\n\r\nThe principal parts of the cranium which are deficient are the anterior\r\nextremities of both the upper and lower jaws, the os frontis, æthmoid\r\nbone, and the whole upper part of the facial division of the skull; but\r\nsufficient remains to show that the general form of the skull resembled\r\nan elongated, slender, subcompressed cone, commencing behind by a\r\nflattened vertical base, slightly expanding to the zygomatic region, and\r\nthence gradually contracting in all its dimensions to the anterior\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Ant-eater (_Orycteropus_), of all Edentata, most nearly\r\nresembles the present fossil in the form of its cranium, and next in\r\nthis comparison the great Armadillo (_Dasypus gigas_, Cuv.) may be\r\ncited: on the supposition, therefore, that the correspondence with the\r\nabove existing Edentals observable in the parts of the fossil cranium\r\nwhich do exist, was carried out through those which are defective, the\r\nlength of the skull of the Scelidothere must have been not less than two\r\nfeet. If now the reader will turn to Pl. XX. he will see that this\r\ncranium is singularly small and slender in proportion to the rest of the\r\nskeleton, especially the bulky pelvis and femur, of which bones the\r\nlatter has a length of seventeen inches, and a breadth of not less than\r\nnine inches; the astragalus, again, exceeds in bulk that of the largest\r\nHippopotamus or Rhinoceros; yet the condition of the epiphyseal\r\nextremities of the long bones proves the present fossils to have\r\nbelonged to an immature animal. Hence, although the Scelidothere, like\r\nmost other Edentals, was of low stature, and, like the Megatherium,\r\npresented a disproportionate development of the hinder parts, it is\r\nprobable, that, bulk for bulk, it equalled, when alive, the largest\r\nexisting pachyderms, not proboscidian. There is no evidence that it\r\npossessed a tesselated osseous coat of mail.\r\n\r\nI shall commence the description of the present skeleton with the\r\ncranium. The condyles of the occiput (See Pl. XXI. fig. 2,) are wide\r\napart, sub-elliptic, very similar in position, form, and relative size\r\nto those in _Orycteropus_. The foramen occipitale is transversely oval,\r\nits plane slopes from above downwards and forwards at an angle of 40°\r\nwith that of the occipital region of the skull. This region, as before\r\nstated, is vertical in position (see fig. 1, Pl. XXI.), of a\r\nsub-semicircular form, the breadth being nearly one-third more than the\r\nheight; it is bounded above and laterally by a pretty regular curve; but\r\nthe superior margin is not produced so far backwards as in\r\n_Orycteropus_. The occipital plane is bisected by a mesial vertical\r\nridge; there is a less developed transverse curved intermuscular crest\r\nwhich runs parallel with and about half an inch below the marginal\r\nridge: the surface of the occipital plane on the interspaces of these\r\nridges is irregularly pitted with the impression of the insertion of\r\npowerful muscles. The corresponding surface is smooth in the Orycterope\r\nand Armadillos; in the great extinct Glossothere it resembles in\r\ncharacter that of the Scelidothere; but in the forward slope of the\r\noccipital plane the Glossothere differs in a marked degree from the\r\npresent animal.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of the cranium is smooth and regularly convex. The\r\nextent of the origin of the temporal muscles is defined by a\r\nslightly-raised broad commencement of a ridge, which, in the older\r\nanimal, might become more developed. There is no trace of this ridge in\r\nthe Orycterope; but it exists in the Armadillos, in which the teeth are\r\nof a denser texture, and better organized for mastication, and\r\nconsequently are associated with better developed masticatory muscles.\r\nIt will be subsequently shown that the Scelidothere resembles the\r\nArmadillos in so far as it possesses a greater proportion of the dense\r\nivory to the external cæmentum in its teeth, than does the Megatherium;\r\nwhile it differs widely from the Orycterope, in the structure of its\r\nteeth. The teeth, however, are fewer in the Scelidothere than in any\r\nArmadillo, and relatively smaller than in most of the species of that\r\nfamily. Accordingly we find that the zygomatic arches are relatively\r\nweaker; and in this particular the _Scelidothere_ corresponds with the\r\nOrycterope. The zygomatic process of the temporal commences posteriorly\r\nabout an inch and a half from the occipital plane, its origin or base is\r\nextended forwards in a horizontal line fully four inches, where it\r\nterminates as usual in a thin concave edge, as shown on the right side\r\nin Pl. XXII. The free portion of the zygoma, continued forwards from the\r\nouter part of this edge, is a slender sub compressed process, half an\r\ninch in the longest or vertical diameter, and less than three lines in\r\nthe transverse; the extremity of this process is broken off; the\r\nopposite extremity of the malar portion of the zygoma is entire, and\r\nobtusely rounded. The bony arch may have been completed by the extension\r\nof the temporal process to the malar one, but the two parts undoubtedly\r\nwere not connected together by so extensive a surface as in the\r\nOrycterope. On the other hand, if the zygomatic arch be naturally\r\nincomplete in the Scelidothere, the interspace between the malar and\r\ntemporal portions must be relatively much less than in the Sloth or\r\nAnt-eater; for the broken end of the temporal part is separated from the\r\nobtusely rounded apex of the malar process in the present specimen by an\r\ninterval of only one inch.\r\n\r\nThe articular surface (Pl. XXIII., fig. 2) beneath the zygoma for the\r\nlower jaw is flat and even, with the outer and inner margin slightly\r\nbent down, but having no definable anterior or posterior limits; its\r\nbreadth is two inches. It differs from the corresponding surface in the\r\nOrycterope in being separated by a relatively wider interval from the\r\ntympanic bone, and in wanting consequently the support which the bony\r\nmeatus auditorius gives in the Orycterope to the back part of the\r\nmandibular joint. The Armadillos differ still more from the Scelidothere\r\nin this important part of the cranial organization, inasmuch as the\r\nglenoid cavity is not only protected behind by the descending os\r\ntympanicum, but also in front by a corresponding vertical downward\r\nextension of the os malæ. The Scelidothere in the general form and\r\nrelative position of the surface for the articulation of the lower jaw\r\nresembles the Glossothere more closely than any other Edentate animal\r\nwith which I have been able to compare it.\r\n\r\nThe malar bone of the Megatherium presents, as is well known, two\r\ncharacters, in which it conspicuously differs from that of the\r\nOrycterope and Armadillos, and approximates in an equally marked degree\r\nto the Sloths; these characters consist in a process ascending as if to\r\ncomplete the posterior circumference of the orbit, and another process\r\ndescending outside the lower jaw to give advantageous and augmented\r\nsurface of attachment to the masseteric muscle, in its character of a\r\nprotractor of the jaw. Now both these modifications of the malar bone\r\nare present in the Scelidothere, and are the chief if not the sole marks\r\nof the affinity to the Megatherium which the structure of the cranium\r\naffords. They are, however, the more interesting, perhaps, on that\r\naccount, and because they are associated with other and more numerous\r\ncharacters approximating the species in question to the ordinary\r\nterrestrial as distinguished from the arboreal Edentata. For if the\r\nScelidothere, instead of the Megathere, had been discovered half a\r\ncentury ago, and if its true nature and affinities had been in like\r\nmanner elucidated by the genius and science of a Cuvier; and supposing\r\non the other hand that the Megatherium instead of the Scelidothere had\r\nbeen one of the novel and interesting fruits of Mr. Darwin’s recent\r\nexploration of the coast of South America, then the affinities of the\r\nMegathere with the Sloths would undoubtedly have been viewed from a\r\ntruer point than at the time when,—the Scelidothere, and analogous\r\ntransitional forms, being unknown,—it was regarded as a gigantic Sloth.\r\n\r\nHaving indicated the principal characters of the cranium of the\r\nScelidothere, which determine its affinities amongst the _Edentata_,\r\nthere next remains to be considered the relative position, extent, and\r\nconnections, of the different bones composing the cranium.\r\n\r\nThe occipital bone constitutes the whole of the posterior, the usual\r\nproportion of the inferior, and a small part of the upper and lateral\r\nportions of the cranial cavity: there is a small descending ex-occipital\r\nprocess immediately exterior to the condyle: above this part the\r\noccipital bone is articulated to the mastoid process of the temporal,\r\nand the supra-occipital plate is joined by a complex dentated lambdoidal\r\nsuture to the two parietals, without the intervention of interparietal\r\nor Wormian bones; the course and form of the lambdoidal suture is shown\r\nin Pl. XXII.; it has the same relative position as in the Orycterope; in\r\nthe Armadillos, the suture runs along the angle between the posterior\r\nand superior surfaces of the skull. The thickness of the occipital bone,\r\nat this angle, in the Scelidothere, exceeds an inch, and its texture\r\nconsists of a close massive diploë, between the dense outer and inner\r\ntables, (Pl. XXIII. fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe squamous portion of the temporal bone has a very slight elevation,\r\nnot extending upon the side of the cranium more than half an inch above\r\nthe zygoma; it is thus relatively lower than in the _Orycteropus_; but\r\nis similarly bounded above by an almost straight line, (Pl. XXI., fig.\r\n1.). The mastoid process is small, compressed, with a rounded contour;\r\nimmediately internal to it is a very deep depression, corresponding to\r\nthat for the digastric muscle. But the most interesting features in this\r\nregion of the temporal bone consist in the free condition of the\r\ntympanic bones, and the presence of a semicircular pit, immediately\r\nbehind the tympanic bone for the articulation of the styloid element of\r\nthe hyoid or tongue-bone: in these points we trace a most remarkable\r\ncorrespondence with the Glossothere, and in the separate tympanic bone\r\nthe same affinity to the Orycteropus, as has been already noticed in the\r\nmore bulky extinct Edental.\r\n\r\nThis correspondence naturally leads to a speculation as to the probable\r\ngeneric relationship between the Glossothere and Scelidothere: now it\r\nmay first be remarked that the styloid articular depression is\r\nrelatively much larger and much deeper in the Glossothere than in the\r\nScelidothere; in the former its diameter equals, as we have seen, one\r\ninch; in the Scelidothere it measures only a third of an inch, the whole\r\ncranium being about two-fifths smaller; if we turn next to the anterior\r\ncondyloid foramina, which in the Scelidothere are double on each side,\r\nwe obtain from them evidence that the muscular nerve of the tongue could\r\nonly have been one-third the size of that of the Glossothere. These\r\nproofs of the superior relative development of the tongue in the\r\nGlossothere indicate a difference of habits, and a modification,\r\nprobably, of the structure of the locomotive extremities; and when we\r\nassociate these deviations from the Scelidothere, with the known\r\ndifference in the position of the occipital plane, which in the\r\nGlossothere corresponds with that in the _Myrmecophaga_ and _Bradypus_,\r\nwe shall be justified in continuing to regard them, until evidence to\r\nthe contrary be obtained, as belonging to distinct genera.\r\n\r\nThe parietal bones present an oblong regular quadrate figure, the\r\nsagittal suture running parallel with the squamous, and the frontal with\r\nthe lambdoidal suture; there is scarcely any trace of denticulations in\r\nthe sagittal suture; the bones are of remarkable thickness, varying, at\r\nthis suture, from six to nine lines, and their opposed surfaces are\r\nlocked together by narrow ridges, which slightly radiate from the lower\r\nto the upper part of the uniting surface: the substance of the bone\r\nconsists of an uniform and pretty dense diploë; and there are no sinuses\r\ndeveloped in it. We can hardly regard the extraordinary air-cells which\r\noccupy the interspace of the two tables of the skull in the parietal and\r\noccipital bones of the Glossothere (Pl. XVI., fig. 3) as a difference\r\ndepending merely on age.\r\n\r\nThe frontal and æthmoid bones are broken away in the present cranium.\r\nThe sphenoid commences two inches in front of the foramen occipitale;\r\nthe fractured state of the skull does not allow its anterior or lateral\r\nlimits to be accurately defined; its body is occupied with large\r\nair-sinuses; the only part, indeed, of this bone which is exposed to\r\nobservation is that which forms part of the floor of the cranium; and\r\nthis we shall now proceed to describe, in connexion with the other\r\npeculiarities of the cranial cavity, (fig. 1. Pl. XXIII.) The body of\r\nthe sphenoid is impressed on its cranial surface with a broad and\r\nshallow sella turcica (_a_), bounded by two grooves, (_b_ _b_,) leading\r\nforwards and inwards from the carotid foramina (_c_); the line of suture\r\nbetween the sphenoid and occipital bones runs along a slight transverse\r\nelevation (_d_), which bounds the sella posteriorly; this suture is\r\npartially obliterated: a slight median protuberance (_e_) bounds the\r\nsella turcica anteriorly; there are neither anterior nor posterior\r\nclinoid processes. External to the carotid channel there is a wide\r\ngroove (_f_) leading to the foramen ovale (_g_); this foramen is about\r\none-third smaller than in the Glossothere, and therefore, as compared\r\nwith the anterior condyloid foramina, indicates that the tongue was\r\nendowed with a greater proportion of sensitive than motive power in the\r\nScelidothere: but in reasoning on the size of this nerve, it must be\r\nremembered that in both animals certain branches, both of the second and\r\nthird divisions of the fifth pair of nerves, are to be associated with\r\nthe persistence of large dental pulps, of which they regulate the\r\nsecreting power. Anterior to the foramen ovale, and at the termination\r\nof the same large common groove, lodging the trunk of the fifth pair of\r\nnerves is the foramen rotundum (_h_); this leads to a very long canal,\r\nthe diameter of which is five lines, being somewhat less than that for\r\nthe third division of the fifth pair. The anterior sphenoid is broken\r\naway, so that no observation can be made on the optic foramina.\r\n\r\nThe basilar process of the occipital bone is perforated at its middle by\r\ntwo small foramina (_i_) on the same transverse line, about half an inch\r\napart.\r\n\r\nIn the Armadillo these foramina do not exist: in the Orycterope they are\r\npresent, but open beneath an overhanging ridge, which is continued from\r\nthem to the upper part of the anterior condyloid foramen on each side.\r\nThe sella turcica of the Orycterope is deeper and narrower than in the\r\nScelidothere; and is separated from the basilar occipital process by a\r\ntransverse ridge, which sends forward two short clinoid processes; two\r\nsmaller anterior clinoid processes project backwards from the angle of\r\nthe anterior boundary of the sella turcica. The foramina ovalia and\r\nrotunda open in the same continuous groove, as in the Glossothere and\r\nScelidothere, but they are relatively wider apart; and the canal for the\r\nthird division of the fifth pair is shorter, and runs more directly\r\noutwards.\r\n\r\nThe petrous bone in the Scelidothere is relatively larger than in the\r\nGlossothere, but this probably arises from the precocious development of\r\nthe organ of hearing in the present immature specimen in obedience to\r\nthe general law. The trunk of the fifth pair of nerves does not impress\r\nit with so deep and well defined a groove as in the Glossothere; the\r\nelliptic internal auditory foramen (_k_) is situated about the middle of\r\nthe posterior surface; behind this is the aqueductus vestibuli; and\r\nimmediately posterior to the petrous bone is the foramen jugulare (_l_):\r\nthe shape of the os petrosum agrees more with that of the Armadillo than\r\nwith that of the Orycterope. An accidental fracture of the right os\r\npetrosum demonstrates its usual dense and brittle texture, and at the\r\nsame time has exposed the cochlea with part of its delicate and\r\nbeautiful lamina spiralis. The conservation of parts of the organs of\r\nvision in certain fossils, has given rise to arguments which prove that\r\nthe laws of light were the same at remote epochs of the earth’s history\r\nas now; and the structures I have just mentioned, in like manner,\r\ndemonstrate that the laws of acoustics have not changed, and that the\r\nextinct giants of a former race of quadrupeds were endowed with the same\r\nexquisite mechanism for appreciating the vibrations of sound as their\r\nexisting congeners enjoy at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe brain, being regulated in its development by laws analogous to those\r\nwhich govern the early perfection of the organ of hearing, appears to\r\nhave been relatively larger in the Scelidothere than in the Glossothere:\r\nit was certainly relatively longer; the fractured cranium gives us six\r\ninches of the antero-posterior diameter of the brain, but the analogy of\r\nthe Orycterope would lead to the inference that it extended further into\r\nthe part which is broken away. The greatest transverse diameter of the\r\ncranial cavity is four inches eight lines: these dimensions, however,\r\nare sufficient to show that the brain was of very small relative size in\r\nthe Scelidothere; and, both in this respect, and in the relative\r\nposition of its principal masses, the brain of the extinct Edental\r\nclosely accords with the general character of this organ in the existing\r\nspecies of the same Order. We perceive by the obtuse ridge continued\r\nobliquely upwards from above the upper edge of the petrous bone, that\r\nthe cerebellum has been situated wholly behind the cerebrum, we learn\r\nalso from the same structure of the enduring parts that these perishable\r\nmasses were not divided, as in the Manis, by a bony septum, but by a\r\nmembranous tentorium, as in the Glossothere and Armadillos: in the\r\nOrycteropus, as has been before remarked, there is a strong, sharp, bony\r\nridge extending into each side of the tentorium. The vertical diameter\r\nof the cerebellum and medulla oblongata equals that of the cerebrum, and\r\nis two inches three lines: the transverse diameter of the cerebellum was\r\nabout three inches nine lines; its antero-posterior extent about one\r\ninch and a half. The sculpturing of the internal surface of the cranial\r\ncavity bespeaks the high vascularity of the soft parts which it\r\ncontained, and there are evident indications that the upper and lateral\r\nsurfaces of the brain had been disposed in a few simple parallel\r\nlongitudinal convolutions. The two anterior condyloid foramina (_m_)\r\nhave the same relative position as the single corresponding foramen in\r\nthe Glossothere, Orycterope, and Armadillos, and the inner surface of\r\nthe skull slopes outwards from these foramina to the inner margin of the\r\noccipital condyle.\r\n\r\nOf the bones of the face there remain only portions of the malar,\r\nlachrymal, palatine, and maxillaries. The chief peculiarities of the\r\nmalar bone have been already noticed: the breadth of the base of the\r\ndescending masseteric processes is two inches two lines; its termination\r\nis broken off: the length of the ascending post-orbital process of the\r\nmalar cannot be determined from the same cause, but it is fortunate that\r\nsufficient of this part of the cranium should have been preserved to\r\ngive this evidence of the affinities of the Scelidothere to the\r\nMegathere. The malar bone is continued anteriorly, in a regular curve\r\nforwards and upwards, to the lachrymal bone, and completes, with it, the\r\nanterior boundary of the orbit: the size of the orbit is relatively\r\nsmaller than in the Orycterope, and still less than in the Ant-eaters:\r\nhere, however, we have merely an exemplification of the general law\r\nwhich regulates the relative size of the eye to the body in the\r\nmammalia. The malar bone does not extend so far forwards in front of the\r\norbit as in either the Orycterope or Armadillo; in the inclination,\r\nhowever, with which the sides of the face converge forwards from the\r\norbits, the Scelidothere holds an intermediate place between the\r\nArmadillos and Orycterope.\r\n\r\nThe lachrymal bone does not extend so far upon the face in the\r\nScelidothere as in the Orycterope; in which respect the Scelidothere\r\nresembles more the Megathere. The foramen for the exit of the\r\ninfra-orbital nerve has the same situation near the orbit as in the\r\nMegathere; its absolute distance from the anterior border of the orbit\r\nis only half that in the Orycterope. The foramen is single in the\r\nScelidothere, as in the Orycterope; in the Megathere there are two or\r\nthree ant-orbital foramina. The vertical diameter of this foramen is\r\neight lines, the transverse diameter four lines. So much of the outer\r\nsurface of the superior maxillary bones as has been preserved, is smooth\r\nand vertical. Each superior maxillary bone contains the sockets of five\r\nteeth, occupying an antero-posterior extent of three inches seven lines,\r\n(Pl. XXII. and XXIII. fig. 3). The posterior alveolus is situated just\r\nbehind the transverse line, extending across the anterior boundary of\r\nthe orbits; the remaining sockets of the molar series extend forwards\r\nthree inches in front of the orbits. In the Megatherium, the roots of\r\nthe five superior molars are all situated behind the anterior boundary\r\nof the orbit: in the Orycteropus, on the contrary, the grinders are all\r\nplaced in advance of the orbit; so that the Scelidothere resembles that\r\nspecies more than the Megathere in the relative location of the teeth.\r\nThe palatal interspace between the roots of the last molar tooth of each\r\nseries is eleven lines; the palate gradually though slightly widens, as\r\nit advances forwards: the posterior margin of the palate is terminated\r\nby an acute-angled notch. In the breadth of the bony palate the\r\nScelidothere is intermediate between the Megathere and Orycterope.\r\n\r\nThe anterior of the upper molars is represented at fig. 3, 4, and 5, Pl.\r\nXXI., and at 1, fig. 3, Pl. XXIII.; it corresponds closely in form and\r\nsize with the opposite molar below; the base of the triangle given by\r\nits transverse section is turned inwards and obliquely forwards.\r\n\r\nThe second molar of the upper jaw, also presents in transverse section a\r\ntriangular form, with the angles rounded off; but the inner side of the\r\ntooth is traversed by a longitudinal groove. The largest diameter of the\r\ntransverse section, which is placed obliquely as regards the axis of the\r\nskull, measures ten lines and a half; the opposite diameter of the tooth\r\nis six lines.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth molars present the same form and size, and relative\r\nposition as the second.\r\n\r\nThe fifth molar is the smallest of the series; its transverse section\r\ngives an inequilateral triangle, with the corners rounded off; the\r\nbroadest side is turned outwards, and is slightly concave; the\r\nantero-posterior diameter of this tooth is seven lines; the transverse\r\nfour lines. The length of the teeth in the upper jaw is about two inches\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\nIt is almost superfluous to observe that the teeth of the Scelidothere,\r\nas in other _Bruta_, are without fangs, and have their inserted base\r\nexcavated by large conical cavities, for the lodgment of a persistent\r\npulp. The tooth is composed of a small central body of coarse ivory or\r\n‘dentine,’ traversed by medullary canals, which at the periphery of the\r\ncoarse dentine anastomose by loops, from the convexity of which the\r\ncalcigerous tubes are given off which form the fine dentine: the layer\r\nof this substance, which immediately surrounds the coarse dentine, is\r\nabout one line and a half in thickness, and the whole is invested with a\r\nvery thin coating of cement. The teeth of the Scelidothere thus present\r\na more resisting structure than do those of the Mylodon; having a larger\r\nproportion of the dense ivory composed of the minute calcigerous tubes,\r\nand a much smaller proportion of the softer external cæmentum; in this\r\nrespect the Scelidothere recedes farther from Megathere, and approaches\r\nnearer the Armadillos than does the Mylodon.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw resembles, in the general form of the posterior moiety\r\nwhich is here preserved, that of the Sloth and Mylodon more than that of\r\nany other Edentate species. Its deep posterior angle is produced\r\nbackwards, and a broad coronoid process rises and nearly fills the\r\nzygomatic space; the condyle is flat, as the glenoid surface has already\r\nindicated; its transverse diameter is an inch and eight lines; its\r\nantero-posterior diameter seven lines: it is principally extended\r\ninwards beyond the vertical line of the ascending ramus. The lower\r\ncontour of the jaw describes an undulating line; which, commencing from\r\nthe posterior angle, is at first gently convex, then slightly concave,\r\nthen again convex, below the alveoli of the teeth, where it is rounded\r\nand expanded, as in the Orycterope. The fractured condition of the right\r\nramus of this part fortunately exposed the roots of the four grinding\r\nteeth, which constitute the dental series on each side of the lower jaw.\r\nThe length of the jaw occupied by these four alveoli is three inches ten\r\nlines, which exceeds a little that of the opposed five grinders above;\r\nthe ramus of the jaw gradually diminishes in all its dimensions anterior\r\nto the molar teeth; the dental canal passes in a gentle curve below, and\r\non the inner side of the alveoli, whence it gradually inclines to the\r\nouter wall of the jaw.\r\n\r\nThe whole ascending ramus of the jaw consists of a very thin plate of\r\nbone; it is slightly concave on the inner side, and the inferior margin\r\nof the produced angle inclines inwards, as in the Mylodon and Sloth; it\r\nis impressed on the outer side with two shallow depressions, and two\r\nparallel ridges, both following the gentle curvature of the part. There\r\nis a foramen on the outer side of the ramus at the anterior part of the\r\nbase of the coronoid process corresponding with that in the lower jaw of\r\nthe Mylodon, but the longitudinal channel which runs along the outer\r\nside of the alveolar processes is wanting, and the expansion at the base\r\nof those processes is more sudden and relatively greater; the general\r\ncorrespondence, however, between these lower jaws is such as would lead\r\nto the idea that they belonged to animals of the same genus, were it not\r\nthat the teeth present modifications of form in the Scelidothere, as\r\ndistinct from those of the Mylodon, as are any of the minor dental\r\ndifferences on which genera or subgenera of existing Mammalia are\r\nfounded in the present state of Zoological Classification.\r\n\r\nTo make this distinction more readily intelligible, I have given a view\r\nof the transverse section of the teeth in the right ramus of the lower\r\njaw (fig. 4, Pl. XXIII.), corresponding with that of the _Mylodon\r\nDarwinii_, (Pl. XVII., fig. 5). In the present subgenus the\r\nantero-posterior extent of the four alveoli of the lower jaw nearly\r\nequals four inches, and is relatively greater than in the Mylodon,\r\nalthough the teeth are placed closer together; this is owing to their\r\ngreater relative size. The first molar tooth presents the simplest form;\r\nits transverse section is a compressed inequilateral triangle with the\r\nangles rounded off; the longest diameter of this section which is\r\nparallel with the inner alveolar border is eleven lines, the transverse\r\ndiameter almost six lines; the base or broadest side of the triangle is\r\nturned inwards, and is slightly concave; the two smaller sides are also\r\nslightly concave.\r\n\r\nThe second molar is placed more obliquely in the jaw; the long axis of\r\nits transverse section intersects at an acute angle that of the jaw\r\nitself; the transverse section presents a compressed or oblong form,\r\nwith the larger end next the outer side, and the smaller end next the\r\ninner side of the jaw; this end is simply rounded, but the outer end\r\npresents a sinuosity, corresponding to a broad groove which traverses\r\nthe whole length of the outer side of the tooth; the anterior, which\r\ncorresponds to the internal side or base of the transverse section of\r\nthe preceding molar, is slightly concave.\r\n\r\nThe third molar has nearly the same form and relative position as the\r\npreceding; the long diameter of the transverse section is, in both, ten\r\nlines and a half; the principal transverse diameter is, in the second\r\nmolar five lines, in the third nearly six; the difference of form\r\nobservable in these as compared with the two middle grinders of the\r\nMylodon is well-marked; in the latter these teeth are impressed with a\r\nlongitudinal groove on their inner sides; in the Scelidothere they have\r\na similar impression along their outer but not along the inner side.\r\n\r\nIn the last molar the resemblance is much closer, and the modification\r\nof form by which it differs from the preceding ones is of the same kind;\r\nthe transverse section gives an irregular oblong figure with its axis\r\nnearly parallel with that of the jaw, and constricted at the middle by\r\nsinuosities produced by two wide channels which traverse longitudinally,\r\none the outer, the other the inner side of the tooth; the latter groove\r\nis much wider and shallower in the Scelidothere than in the Mylodon. The\r\ntwo lobes produced by these grooves are more equal in Scelidothere; the\r\nanterior one is concave on its anterior surface instead of convex as in\r\nthe Mylodon; the posterior one is more compressed; the longitudinal or\r\nantero-posterior diameter of the transverse section of this tooth is one\r\ninch five lines; the greatest transverse diameter is nine lines; the\r\ndiameter of the isthmus joining the lobes is three lines and a half; the\r\nentire length of this tooth is three inches three lines.[46]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VERTEBRAL COLUMN.\r\n\r\nOf this part of the skeleton of the Scelidothere, Mr. Darwin’s specimen\r\nincludes, as is represented in Plate XX., the cervical, part of the\r\ndorsal, and the sacral series of vertebræ in a more or less perfect\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe cervical vertebræ present the ordinary mammalian number, seven, and\r\nare free, or so articulated as to have permitted reciprocal movement\r\nupon each other. Their transverse processes are perforated as usual for\r\nthe vertebral arteries. These processes in the atlas are remarkable for\r\ntheir great breadth, length, and thickness; and indicate the muscular\r\nforces which must have worked the head upon the spine to have been very\r\npowerful. The axis is provided with a robust ‘processus dentatus,’\r\nhaving a base equal in breadth to the body of the axis itself; and a\r\nsmooth articular convexity on the side of the apex on which the ring of\r\nthe atlas rotated. The line of union between the axis and its\r\ncharacteristic process, which here resembles the body of an abortive\r\nvertebra, is very distinct. The transverse processes of the vertebra\r\ndentata are comparatively feeble, but this condition is amply\r\ncompensated for by the great development of the spinous process. (Pl.\r\nXXIV. fig. 1.) This process is bent backwards at nearly a right angle,\r\noverlaps with its reflected extremity the spine of the third cervical\r\nvertebra, and rests by its base, on the under part of which are the\r\nposterior articular surfaces, upon the broad and strong anterior oblique\r\nprocesses of the third vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebræ have moderately\r\ndeveloped and pointed spinous processes: their transverse processes are\r\nbroad, and extend obliquely backwards, and slightly overlap each other.\r\nOn the under part of the transverse process of the sixth cervical\r\nvertebra there is the fractured base of what I conjecture to have been\r\nan expanded aliform plate, analogous to that observable in the\r\ncorresponding vertebra of the Orycterope. The seventh cervical vertebra\r\nhas part of the articular depression for the head of the first rib upon\r\neach side of its body: the transverse process is feebly developed, but\r\nthe spine is double the height and size of those of the preceding\r\nvertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra in like manner rises to\r\ntwice the height of the preceding spine of the seventh cervical, and\r\npreserves an equal antero-posterior diameter from its base to its\r\nsummit, which is thick and slightly bent backwards: four or five\r\nsucceeding dorsal vertebræ give evidence of having been surmounted by\r\nspines of equal height and strength. The transverse processes of these\r\ndorsal vertebræ present bold concavities on their inferior part for the\r\nreception of the tubercles of the ribs, and they gradually ascend upon\r\nthe base of the spines as the vertebræ are placed further back, so as to\r\nincrease the expansiveness of the chest. The state of the fossil did not\r\nafford further information as to the condition of this part of the\r\nvertebral column, but the parts which have been preserved are precisely\r\nthose from which the most interesting inferences as to the affinities\r\nand habits of the extinct quadruped can be deduced.\r\n\r\nWhether the Megatherium be most nearly allied to the tribes of the Sloth\r\nor Armadillo has been a question under recent discussion, and, as a\r\ncorollary of this problem, whether its habits were those of a scansorial\r\nor of a fossorial quadruped. For, strange as it may appear at first\r\nsight, there have not been wanting arguments, and those urged by an\r\nanatomist to whom we owe much novel and interesting information\r\nrespecting the extinct Edentata, in support of the belief that the\r\nMegatherium, gigantic and ponderous as must have been its frame,\r\nactually climbed trees like a Sloth, and had claws and feet organised\r\nfor prehensile actions, and not in accordance with that type by which\r\nthey are usually adapted for digging up the soil.[47]\r\n\r\nNow, in whatever degree the Megatherium may be involved in this\r\nquestion, the smaller Megatherioid species at present under\r\nconsideration must be at least equally implicated in it. In the\r\nadaptation of the frame of a mammiferous quadruped for especial and\r\npeculiar actions and modes of life, such as for climbing and living in\r\ntrees, or for burrowing and seeking concealment in the earth, not only\r\nthe immediate instruments, as the feet, are modified, but the whole of\r\nthe osseous and muscular fabric is more or less impressed with\r\ncorresponding adaptations, whilst at the same time these special\r\nadjustments are invariably subordinated to the type of organization\r\nwhich characterizes the group.\r\n\r\nThe type of the order _Bruta_ or _Edentata_ is well-marked; one or more\r\nclaws of unusual length and strength, characterize the fore-feet and\r\nsometimes the hind-feet in every genus, and the term ‘Macronykia’ would\r\nmore aptly designate them than the term which Cuvier substituted for the\r\ngood old Linnean appellation. The uniform absence of true roots to the\r\nteeth, where these are present, is another general character; the\r\nskeleton exhibits many well-marked peculiarities common to the whole\r\norder; while at the same time it is modified in various modes and\r\ndegrees in accordance with the peculiar habits and exigencies of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nOne of the regions of the skeleton which manifests adaptive\r\nmodifications of this kind in the most remarkable degree is the cervical\r\ndivision of the vertebral column. In one edentate species it is\r\nlengthened out by two additional vertebræ more than in any other mammal;\r\nin another it is reduced by anchylosis to as great an extent below the\r\nregular number of moveable pieces: and these, the two most opposite\r\nconditions of the cervical vertebræ which are to be met with in the\r\nmammiferous class are related to equally diverse and opposite habits of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the _Ai_, or three-toed Sloth, “an animal, great part of\r\nwhose life, when not engaged in eating, is spent in sleeping on\r\ntrees,—an easy attitude for repose is most essential to its comfortable\r\nexistence; and accordingly we find, that the auxiliary vertebræ at the\r\nbase of the neck contribute to produce that flexibility of this organ\r\nwhich allows the head of the animal to incline forwards and rest upon\r\nits bosom.” Dr. Buckland, from whose Paper on the “Adaptation of the\r\nStructure of the Sloths to their peculiar Mode of Life,”[48] the\r\npreceding judicious physiological remark is quoted, adduces the\r\nauthority of Mr. Burchell in proof that the Sloth can in a remarkable\r\nmanner and with great facility twist its head quite round, and look in\r\nthe face of a person standing directly behind it, while at the same time\r\nthe body and limbs remain unmoved. A single glance at the length and\r\nslenderness of the cervical region of the spine, and of the feeble\r\ncondition of the transverse and spinous processes in the vertebræ\r\ncomposing that part of the skeleton of the Sloth, is enough to show its\r\nadaptation to increase the rotatory motion and flexibility of the neck.\r\n\r\nIn describing the skeleton of a species of Armadillo (_Dasypus\r\n6–cinctus_, Linn.)[49] I was led in like manner to point out the\r\nsubserviency of the peculiarities of the cervical vertebræ to the habits\r\nand mode of life of that animal; observing that the “anchylosis of the\r\ncervical vertebræ obtains in the _Cetacea_, as well as in the genus\r\n_Dasypus_, and that as in the aquatic order this firm connexion of the\r\ncervical vertebræ assists materially in enabling the head to overcome\r\nthe resistance of the dense fluid through which they perpetually move,\r\nso in the Armadillos a like advantage may be derived from this structure\r\nduring the act of displacing the denser material in which they excavate\r\ntheir retreats.”[50]\r\n\r\nHaving in view these well-marked examples of the subserviency of the\r\nstructure of the bones of the neck to the habits of existing species of\r\nthe order _Bruta_, I proceeded to investigate the structure of the\r\ncorresponding part of the skeleton in the _Scelidotherium_, hoping\r\nthereby to gain a new and useful element in the determination of the\r\nproblem at present under discussion, as to the affinities and habits of\r\nthe extinct Megatherioid quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nThe fossil, in its original state, yielded a view of so much of the\r\nanterior part of the bodies of the cervical vertebræ as proved that they\r\nwere neither so numerous as in the Sloth, nor anchylosed together as in\r\nthe Armadillos: after a long and careful chiselling at the hard matrix\r\nin which they were imbedded, the transverse and spinous processes were\r\nexposed to view, as they are represented in Plates XX. and XXIV. The\r\ndescription of these processes has already been given.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the cervical vertebræ of the Scelidotherium with those of\r\nthe existing _Bruta_, the closest resemblance to them was found in the\r\nskeleton of the Orycterope. Now this quadruped, though not so rapid a\r\nburrower, or so strictly a subterranean species as the Armadillos,\r\nparticipates, nevertheless, to a certain extent, in their fossorial\r\nhabits, and is closely allied to them in general structure: it differs\r\nfrom them, indeed, mainly in a modification of the dental system, in the\r\nabsence of dermal armour, and of anchylosis of the cervical vertebræ.\r\nBut the advantages which, as a burrower, it would have derived from the\r\nlatter structure, are compensated for by the shortness of the cervical\r\nvertebræ, and by the great development and imbricated or interlocking\r\nco-adaptation of the transverse and anterior spinous processes of the\r\ncervical vertebræ. The analogous quadruped in the South American\r\nContinent—the great ant-eater (_myrmecophaga jubata_) which uses its\r\npowerful compressed fossorial claws for breaking through the hard walls\r\nof the habitations of its insect prey, but which does not excavate a\r\nsubterraneous retreat for itself, presents the cervical vertebræ of a\r\nmore elongated form, and without that development of the spinous and\r\ntransverse processes which tend to fix the neck and increase the size of\r\nthe muscles which move the head: and, if we could conceive that its\r\nfore-feet were employed to scratch up vegetable roots, instead of\r\ndisinterring termites, there would be no reason to expect any\r\nmodification of the cervical vertebræ as a direct consequence of such a\r\ndifference in the application of its fossorial extremities: when,\r\ntherefore, we find that the cervical vertebræ do actually differ in two\r\nmyrmecophagous species, to the extent observable in the Cape and South\r\nAmerican ant-eaters, we arrive legitimately at the conclusion that such\r\ndifference relates to fossorial habits of the one species, in which\r\nhabits the other does not participate.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, if this conclusion be just in regard to the Orycterope,\r\nit must bear with more force upon the question of the habits of the\r\nScelidotherium as the mechanism for strengthening the connection of\r\ncervical vertebræ, and for augmenting the surface of attachment of the\r\nmuscles which worked the head and neck, is more strongly wrought out in\r\nthat extinct species.\r\n\r\nThe great size and strength of the spinous process of the dentata, and\r\nthe mode in which it is interlocked with the spinous and oblique\r\nprocesses of the third cervical, together with the imbricated\r\ndisposition of the transverse processes of this and the succeeding\r\nvertebræ, and the remarkable height of the dorsal spines, all combine to\r\nindicate in a very striking manner, if not to demonstrate, that the\r\nconical head of the present species, which is comparatively small and\r\nslender, and for its own mere support requiring therefore no such\r\nmechanism, was used in aid of the fossorial actions of the extremities.\r\n\r\nAs the cervical vertebræ of the Megatherium have their processes\r\ncomparatively weaker than in the Scelidotherium, and the anterior dorsal\r\nspines are relatively shorter, it may be concluded, that whatever were\r\nthe extent or nature of the fossorial labours of the enormous claws with\r\nwhich it was provided, the head did not co-operate with the digging\r\nimplements in their especial task in the same degree as in the\r\nScelidothere and Orycterope. At the same time there is no modification\r\nof the cervical region of the spine of the Megathere corresponding with\r\nthose which we have seen to be subservient to the arboreal habits of the\r\nsloth, a remark which will not be deemed superfluous by those who have\r\nperused the acute observations and arguments adduced by M. Lund in\r\nfavour of the scansorial character of the extremities of the Megatherium\r\nand Megalonyx.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of the dorsal vertebræ and ribs of the Scelidotherium,\r\nwhich are figured in Plate XX., offer no modifications which need detain\r\nour attention; they closely conform, excepting in the greater relative\r\nheight of the anterior dorsal spines, already noticed, with the\r\nMegatherioid type. The sacrum manifests in its vast expanse, the great\r\ndevelopment of the posterior transverse processes to join the ischium,\r\nthe capacious medullary cavity, and wide nervous foramina, a like\r\nconformity with the Megatherium, and a corresponding harmony with the\r\ndisproportionate bulk of the hind legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES.\r\n\r\nThe Scapula in its double spine, the osseous arch formed by the\r\nconfluence of the acromion with the coracoid process, and the\r\nsubstitution of a distinct foramen for the suprascapular notch, agrees\r\nwith that of the Megatherium: but the span of the acromial arch is\r\nrelatively wider, and the surface for the articulation of the clavicle\r\nis better marked. This articular surface, which is distinctly shewn upon\r\nthe acromion of both the scapulæ in Pl. XX. is the more interesting, as\r\nbeing the only evidence of the clavicle of the Scelidothere which we at\r\npresent possess; but it is enough to prove that this quadruped enjoyed\r\nall the advantages in the actions of the fore extremity, which arise out\r\nof the additional fixation of the shoulder-joint afforded by the\r\nclavicle—a bone which the extinct Megatherioids are the largest of the\r\nmammiferous class to possess in a completely developed state. The form,\r\nposition, and aspect of the glenoid cavity for the humerus closely\r\ncorrespond with the condition of the same part in the Megatherium. The\r\nlimits of the acromial and coronoid portions of the arch were still\r\ndefineable in the present skeleton, which indicates the nonage of the\r\nindividual in the unanchylosed condition of most of the epiphysiaes.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the presence of a clavicle in the Megalonyx M. Lund has\r\ndeduced certain conclusions, which, if well founded, would be equally\r\napplicable to the present allied species, and to the great Megatherium.\r\nI am induced, therefore, to offer a few physiological observations on\r\nthat bone, which appear to me to lead to a more correct interpretation\r\nof its uses and relations in the great mammiferous animals now under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nWhen the anterior extremities in mammalia are used simply for the\r\npurpose of progressive motion on dry land, as in the Pachyderms and\r\nRuminants, or in water, as in the Cetaceans, there is no clavicle; this\r\nbone is introduced between the sternum and acromion, in order to give\r\nfirmness and fixity to the shoulder-joint when the fore-leg is to\r\ndischarge some other office than that of locomotion. In these cases,\r\nhowever, the clavicle exists in various degrees of development, and even\r\nits rudiment may be dispensed with in some of the actions which require\r\na considerable extent of lateral or outward motion, and of freedom of\r\nrotation of the fore-limb. When, therefore, we find the clavicle fully\r\ndeveloped in the skeleton of an extinct mammiferous animal, and so\r\nplaced as to give the humeral articulation all the benefit of this\r\nadditional mechanism, we may confidently expect that it will afford an\r\ninsight into the habits and mode of life of such extinct species. M.\r\nLund[51] has argued from the clavicle of the Megalonyx, that it climbed\r\nlike a Sloth. “Animals,” says Sir C. Bell,[52] “which fly or dig, or\r\nclimb, as Bats, Moles, Porcupines, Squirrels, Ant-eaters, Armadillos,\r\nand Sloths, have this bone; for in them, a lateral or outward motion is\r\nrequired.” But in regard to the present problem, we have to enquire\r\nwhether the clavicle manifests any modifications of form, of strength,\r\nor development in relation to the special differences of these several\r\nactions, with which its presence is asserted to be associated?\r\n\r\nIn mammals which fly, the clavicle is always complete: the rabbit, the\r\nfox, and the badger are instances of burrowing animals in which the\r\nclavicle is absent or rudimental. The presence of a perfect clavicle is\r\nnot more constant in climbing quadrupeds. The Ai, for example, has an\r\nincomplete clavicle, which is attached to the acromion process, and\r\nterminates in a point about one-fourth of the distance between the\r\nacromion and the top of the sternum, to which the clavicular style is\r\nattached by a long slender ligament: the advantage, therefore, which a\r\nperfect clavicle affords in the fixation of the shoulder-joint, is lost\r\nto this climber _par excellence_. Again, the Bears, which are the\r\nbulkiest quadrupeds that are gifted with the faculty of climbing, and\r\nthis in so perfect a degree that the Sun-bears of the Eastern Tropics\r\nmay be termed arboreal animals,—these scansorial quadrupeds are\r\ndestitute of even the smallest rudiment of a clavicle, as I have\r\nascertained by repeated careful dissection.\r\n\r\nSince, therefore, a clavicle in any degree of development is not\r\nessential to a climbing quadruped, we must seek for some other relation\r\nand use of that remarkably strong, and perfect bone, as it exists in the\r\nMegathere, Megalonyx, and Scelidothere. The absence of ‘dentes primores’\r\nor of anterior or incisive teeth in these quadrupeds at once sets aside\r\nany idea of its connection with an action of the fore extremities, very\r\ncommon in the mammals which possess clavicles, viz., that of carrying\r\nthe food to the mouth, and holding it there to be gnawed by the teeth.\r\nFlying is of course out of the question, although our surprise would\r\nhardly be less at seeing a beast as bulky as an elephant climbing a\r\ntree, than it would be to witness it moving through the air. If now we\r\nrestrict our comparison to the relations of the clavicle in that order\r\nof Mammalia to which the extinct species in question belonged, we shall\r\nsee that it is most constant, strongest, and most complete in those\r\nspecies which make most use of their strong and long claws in displacing\r\nthe earth, as the Armadillos and Orycteropus: and, as the clavicle is\r\nincomplete in one climbing Edental, we are naturally led to conclude\r\nthat its perfect development in an extinct species must have been\r\nassociated with uses and relations analogous to those with which it\r\ncoexists in other genera of the same order. Thus it will be seen, that,\r\nin rejecting the conclusion drawn by M. Lund from the presence of a\r\nclavicle, I concur in the opinion expressed by Dr. Buckland[53] that the\r\nMegatherium—and with it the Megalonyx and Scelidotherium—had the\r\nshoulder-joint strengthened by the clavicle, in reference to the office\r\nof the fore-arm, as an instrument to be employed in digging roots out of\r\nthe ground. Not, however, that these gigantic quadrupeds fed on roots,\r\nbut rather, as the structure of the teeth would show, on the foliage of\r\nthe trees uprooted by the agency of this powerful mechanism of the\r\nfore-legs, and of the otherwise unintelligible colossal strength of the\r\nhaunches, hind legs, and tail.\r\n\r\nThe humerus presents a large convex oval head, on each side of which is\r\na tuberosity for the implantation of the supra- and sub-scapular\r\nmuscles: these tuberosities do not rise above the articular convexity,\r\nso as to restrict the movements of the shoulder-joint, as in the Horse\r\nand Ruminants, but exhibit a structure and disposition conformable to\r\nthose which characterize the proximal extremity of the humerus in other\r\nmammalia which enjoy rotatory movements of the upper or fore-limb. The\r\ntuberosities are, however, relatively more developed, and give greater\r\nbreadth to the proximal end of the humerus in the Scelidothere than in\r\nthe Megathere. The distal end of the humerus, although mutilated,\r\nclearly indicates that it had the same characteristic breadth of the\r\nexternal and internal condyles, as in the Megatherium. In fig. 1. Pl.\r\nXXV. which gives a front view of the left humerus, the broad internal\r\ncondyle, with its extremity broken off, is seen projecting to the left\r\nhand; both in this figure and in fig. 2. in which the internal side of\r\nthe humerus is turned towards the observer, the wide groove, with its\r\ntwo osseous boundaries, is shewn, which plainly indicates that the left\r\ncondyle was perforated for the direct passage of the artery or median\r\nnerve, or of both, to the fore-arm. The groove for the musculo-spiral\r\nnerve on the outer side of the humerus is over-arched at its upper part\r\nby a strong obtuse process; which is comparatively less developed in the\r\nMegatherium. The trochlear or inferior articular surface of the humerus\r\npresents, as in the Megatherium, two well-marked convexities, with an\r\nintervening concavity: this indication of the rotatory power of the\r\nfore-leg is confirmed by the form of the head of the radius.\r\n\r\nIn Pl. XXV. fig. 4. a view is given of this articular surface: it\r\npresents the form of a subcircular gentle concavity, which plays upon\r\nthe outer convexity of the humeral articular surface: immediately below\r\nthe upper concavity the radius presents a lateral smooth convex surface,\r\nwhich rotates upon a small concavity on the ulna, analogous to the\r\n‘lesser semilunar,’ in human anatomy, in which the mechanism for\r\nrotation, so far as the upper joint of the radius is concerned, is not\r\nmore elaborately wrought out than in the present extinct edentate\r\nquadruped. The radius expands as it proceeds to the elbow-joint, where\r\nit attains a breadth indicative of the great power and size of the\r\nunguiculate paw, of which it may be called the stem, and to the\r\nmovements of which it served as the pivot.\r\n\r\nAll the bones of the fore-limb just described—the scapula, the humerus,\r\nand the radius,—indicate by the bold features and projections of the\r\nmuscular ridges and tubercles the prodigious force which was\r\nconcentrated upon the actions of the fore-paw, and the ulna, in its\r\nbroad and high olecranon (of which a side view is given in fig. 2. Pl.\r\nXXV.) gives corresponding evidence. The great semilunar concavity is\r\ntraversed by a sub-median smooth ridge, which plays upon the interspace\r\nof the two humeral convexities. The body of the bone is subcompressed,\r\nstraight, and diminishes in size as it approaches the carpal joint: the\r\nimmediate articulating surfaces are wanting in both the radius and ulna,\r\nthe epiphyseal distal extremities having become detached from their\r\nrespective diaphyses.\r\n\r\nOf the terminal segment of the locomotive extremities, the only evidence\r\namong the remains of the skeleton of the Scelidothere is the ungueal\r\nphalanx figured at Pl. XXVII. 3, 4, and 5; but as it is uncertain\r\nwhether it belongs to the fore or hind-foot, it will be described after\r\nthe other bones of the extremities have been noticed.\r\n\r\nOf these bones the femur is the most remarkable, both for its great\r\nproportional size, and its extreme breadth, as compared with its length\r\nor thickness: but in all these circumstances the affinity of the\r\nScelidothere with the Megathere is prominently brought into view. There\r\nis no other known quadruped with which the Scelidothere so closely\r\ncorresponds in this respect. In proceeding, however, to compare together\r\nthe thigh-bones of these two extinct quadrupeds, several differences\r\npresent themselves, which are worthy of notice: of these the first is\r\nthe presence in the Scelidothere of a depression for a ‘ligamentum\r\nteres’ on the back part of the head of the femur, near its junction with\r\nthe neck of the bone: this is shewn in the posterior view of the femur\r\ngiven in Pl. XX. The head itself forms a pretty regular hemisphere: the\r\ngreat trochanter does not rise so high as in the Megatherium, but,\r\nrelatively, it emulates it in breadth: the small trochanter is\r\nproportionally more developed: the external contour of the shaft of the\r\nfemur is straighter in the Scelidothere than in the Megathere, and the\r\nshaft itself is less bowed forwards at that part. The articular condyles\r\noccupy a relatively smaller space upon the distal extremity of the femur\r\nin the Scelidothere, and they differ more strikingly from those of the\r\nMegathere, in being continued one into the other: the rotular surface,\r\nfor example, which is shewn in fig. 5. Pl. XXV. is formed by both\r\ncondyles, while in the Megatherium it is a continuation exclusively of\r\nthe external articular surface.\r\n\r\nThe patella, which works upon the above-mentioned surface, is a thick\r\nstrong ovate bone, with the smaller end downwards: rough and convex\r\nexternally, smooth on the internal surface, which is concave in the\r\nvertical and convex in the transverse directions.\r\n\r\nOf the bones of the leg only the proximal end of the tibia is preserved;\r\nbut this is valuable, as shewing another well-marked difference between\r\nthe Scelidothere and Megathere; for whereas in the latter the fibula is\r\nanchylosed with the tibia, this bone, in the Scelidothere, presents a\r\nsmooth flat oval articular surface, which is shewn in fig. 2. Pl. XXVII.\r\nbelow the outer part of the head of the bone; from the size and\r\nappearance of which, I infer, that the fibula would not have become\r\nconfluent with the tibia, even in the mature and full-grown animal.\r\n\r\nThe relative length of the fore and hind extremities cannot be precisely\r\ndetermined from the present imperfect skeleton of the Scelidothere; but\r\nthere is good evidence for believing, that the fore extremity was the\r\nshortest. The humerus is shorter than the femur by one-ninth part of the\r\nlatter bone; and the radius, which wants only the distal epiphysis, must\r\nhave been shorter than the humerus. Now the relative development of the\r\nfore and hind legs is one of the points to be taken into consideration\r\nin an attempt to determine the habits and nature of an extinct mammal.\r\n\r\nIn climbing animals the prehensile power is more essential to the hinder\r\nthan to the fore parts or extremities. In the leech the principal sucker\r\nis in the tail; and higher organized climbers, in like manner, depend\r\nmainly on their posterior claspers in descending trees, and hold on by\r\nmeans of them whilst selecting the place for the next application of\r\nthose at the fore part of the body, whether their place be supplied by\r\nthe beak, as in the Maccaws, or the fore-feet or hands in the Mammalia.\r\n\r\nBut, although we perceive the hinder limbs to be the last to lose the\r\nadvantageous structure of the hand in the Quadrumanous species, and\r\nnotwithstanding that the tail is for this purpose sometimes specially\r\norganized to serve as a prehensile instrument, yet we find that the\r\npower of grasping the branches of trees by either legs or tail is never\r\nmaintained at the expense of undue bulk and weight of those organs. On\r\nthe contrary, as the fore-limbs are the main instruments in the active\r\nexertions of climbing, so they are the strongest as well as the longest\r\nin all the best climbers, and the weight of the body which they have to\r\ndrag along is diminished by dwarfish proportions of the hinder limbs, as\r\nin the Orangs and the Sloths.\r\n\r\nCan those huge quadrupeds have been destined to climb that had the\r\npelvis and hinder extremities more ponderous and bulky in proportion to\r\nthe fore parts of the body than in any other known existing or extinct\r\nvertebrate animals?\r\n\r\nM. Lund argues for the scansorial character of the Megalonyx, because\r\nits anterior extremities are longer than the posterior ones; but if they\r\nsomewhat exceed the hind legs in length, how vastly inferior are they in\r\nrespect of their breadth and thickness. The prehensile faculty of the\r\nhinder limbs of the best climbers, as the Sloths, Orangs, and Chameleons\r\nis by no means dependent on the superior mass of muscle and bone which\r\nenters into their conformation, but is associated with the very reverse\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to survey the discrepancy of size between the femur and\r\nthe humerus of the Scelidothere, as exhibited in Pl. XX., without a\r\nconviction that it relates to other habits than those of climbing trees.\r\nThe expanse of the sacrum, the evidence of the muscular masses employed\r\nin working the hind legs and tail, which is afforded by the capacity of\r\nthe cavity lodging the part of the spinal marrow from which the nerves\r\nof those muscles were derived, both indicate the actions of the hind\r\nlegs and tail to have been more powerful and energetic than would be\r\nrequired for mere prehension: and the association of hinder extremities\r\nso remarkable for their bulk, with a long and powerful tail, forbids my\r\nyielding assent to the speculation set forth by M. Lund, as to the\r\nprehensile character of the tail of the Megalonyx.\r\n\r\n_Astragalus._—In the examination of this characteristic bone I have kept\r\nin view the question of the habits of the Megatherioid quadrupeds in\r\ngeneral, and the especial affinities of the Scelidotherium, in\r\nillustration of which I shall notice at the same time the peculiarities\r\nof the astragalus of the Sloth, Megatherium and Armadillo.[54]\r\n\r\nThe upper articular surface of the astragalus of the Scelidotherium (Pl.\r\nXXVI. fig. 4.), presents, in its transverse contour, two convex pulleys,\r\n_a_ and _b_, and an intermediate concavity, forming one continuous\r\narticular surface. The external or fibular trochlea (_a_) is strictly\r\nspeaking convex only at its posterior part, the upper surface gradually\r\nnarrowing to a ridge, as it advances forwards from which, the inner and\r\nouter parts slope away at an angle of 35°.\r\n\r\nThe tibial[55] convexity (_b_) is more regular and less elevated, it has\r\nonly half the antero-posterior extent of the outer pulley; its marginal\r\ncontour forms an obtuse angle at the inner side.\r\n\r\nIn the Megatherium the upper articular surface of the astragalus is also\r\ndivided into two trochleæ, of which the one on the fibular side (fig. 3,\r\n_a_), is of much greater relative size and extent than the tibial one\r\n(_b_), and is raised nearly four inches above the level of the latter,\r\nalthough in the oblique position in which the bone is naturally placed\r\nin the skeleton, the highest part of each convexity is on the same\r\nlevel. The fibular trochlea differs also from that in the Scelidothere\r\nin being regularly convex in the transverse as well as the\r\nantero-posterior direction. The tibial convexity resembles that in the\r\nScelidothere, save in its smaller relative size; its internal margin\r\nlikewise forms an angular projection below the internal malleolus.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of the astragalus of the Mylodon, or Megalonyx(?) (Pl.\r\nXXVIII. fig. 5.),[56] differs from that in the Megatherium in having a\r\nnarrower fibular trochlear ridge.\r\n\r\nThe astragalus of the Ai (_Bradypus tridactylus_) differs widely from\r\nthat of either the Megathere, Mylodon(?) or Scelidothere in having a\r\nconical cavity on the upper surface, in place of the fibular convexity,\r\nin which concavity the distal end of the fibula rotates like a pivot.\r\nThis mechanism is closely related to the scansorial uses of the inwardly\r\ninflected foot of the Sloth.\r\n\r\nIf the astragalus of an Armadillo[57] were placed side by side with that\r\nof the Megathere, it would be very difficult to determine the analogous\r\nparts, especially of the upper surface, unless guided by the\r\nintermediate structure presented by the Scelidothere. The upper surface\r\nof this bone, in the Armadillo, is, however, divided into two\r\ntransversely convex trochleæ, separated by a much wider transversely\r\nconcave surface. The fibular trochlea resembles that of the Scelidothere\r\nin having its upper and outer facets sloping away at an acute angle, but\r\nwithout meeting at a ridge anteriorly; this surface is not more raised\r\nabove the tibial trochlea than in the Scelidothere.\r\n\r\nThe inner trochlea differs from that of the Scelidothere in having a\r\ngreater relative antero-posterior extent, and in forming, in place of an\r\nuniform convex surface, a trochlea similar in structure to that on the\r\nouter side. The extent of rough surface on the upper part of the\r\nastragalus intervening between the articular surface for the bones of\r\nthe leg, and that for the scaphoides is extremely small in the Megathere\r\nand Mylodon(?); it is relatively greater in the Scelidothere; it is\r\nstill more extensive in the Armadillo; but is the longest in the Sloth.\r\nThe anterior extremity of the astragalus which is entirely occupied by\r\nthe scaphoid articular surface is very peculiar in the Scelidothere (Pl.\r\nXXVI. fig. 2.): it presents one convex and two concave facets, which,\r\nhowever, form part of one continuous articular surface: the convex facet\r\nforms the internal part of the surface, and presents a rhomboidal form\r\nwith the long axis vertical. The concave facets (_c_ and _d_) are\r\nextended transversely and placed one above the other; they are slightly\r\nconcave in the transverse, and nearly flat in the vertical directions.\r\n\r\nIn the Megatherium (fig. 1.) the scaphoid surface of the astragalus is\r\ndivided only into one concave and one convex portion, both continuous\r\nwith each other: the concave facet (_c_) corresponds with the upper\r\nconcavity in the Scelidothere, but is a pretty uniform subcircular\r\ndepression, fourteen lines in depth: the convex facet, _d_, is continued\r\nacross the whole breadth of the under part of the scaphoid surface and\r\ncorresponds with both the inner convex, and lower concave surfaces of\r\nthe scaphoid articulation in the Scelidothere.\r\n\r\nIn the Mylodon(?) (Pl. XXVIII. fig. 3.), the articular facet,\r\ncorresponding with that marked (_c_) in the astragali of the Megathere\r\nand Scelidothere, is simply flattened, instead of being concave; the\r\nrest of the scaphoid surface corresponds with that in the Megatherium.\r\n\r\nIn the Armadillo the scaphoid articular surface is undivided and wholly\r\nconvex: in this part of the astragalus, therefore, we find the\r\nScelidothere deviating from the Armadillo further than does the\r\nMegathere; while the Mylodon or Megalonyx(?) most resembles the\r\nArmadillo in the configuration of this part of the astragalus.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the outer surfaces of the astragalus in these quadrupeds,\r\nwe shall find, however, that the Scelidothere and Armadillo closely\r\nagree: the outer facet of the fibular trochleæ, above described, is\r\ncontinued in the Scelidothere (Pl. XXVIII. fig. 2.), upon the fibular\r\nside of the astragalus reaching nearly half-way down the posterior part,\r\nand down nearly the whole of its anterior.\r\n\r\nIn the Armadillo, it extends over the whole of the anterior part of the\r\nouter side of the astragalus. In both animals the lower boundary of this\r\narticular surface describes a strong sigmoid curve.\r\n\r\nIn the Megatherium (Pl. XXVIII. fig. 1), the corresponding surface for\r\nthe fibular malleolus on the outer side of the astragalus is formed by a\r\ncomparatively very small semicircular flattened facet, which by its\r\nroughness indicates that the end of the fibula was attached to it by\r\nligamentous substance, and that the synovial bag was not continued upon\r\nthat surface as in the Scelidothere and Armadillo.\r\n\r\nIn the Mylodon(?) (Pl. XXVIII. fig. 4), even this rough facet is wanting\r\nand the fibular trochlea is bounded by the angle which divides the upper\r\nfrom the outer surface of the astragalus.\r\n\r\nTurning now our attention to the under surface of the astragalus, we\r\nobserve that it presents in the Scelidothere (Pl. XXVI. fig. 6), an\r\nirregular quadrate form, having the outer side occupied by an elongated\r\nsubovate articular facet, _e_, for the calcaneum, bounded externally by\r\na sharp edge, with its long axis and its greatest concavity in the\r\nantero-posterior direction, and slightly convex from side to side: a\r\nsecond calcaneal articular surface (_f_) is situated at the inner and\r\nanterior angle; it is oblong and nearly flat; is continuous with the\r\ninferior concave facet of the scaphoid articulation, but is divided from\r\nthe convex facet by a groove: the two calcaneal articulations are\r\nseparated by a deep and rough depression, traversing the under surface\r\nof the astragalus diagonally, and increasing in breadth towards the\r\nposterior and internal angle. The inner side of the astragalus presents\r\na convex protuberance.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the astragalus of the Scelidothere and\r\nMegathere is best seen at the under surface of the bone: in both the two\r\ncalcaneal articulations are separated by the diagonal depression, and\r\nthe internal and anterior surface is continuous with the scaphoid\r\narticulation. In the Megathere, however, in consequence of the absence\r\nof the inferior concavity which characterizes the Scelidothere, the\r\nanterior calcaneal facet (_f_) appears as a more direct backward\r\ncontinuation of the scaphoidal surface; but they are divided by a more\r\nmarked angle than is represented in the figure (fig. 5, Pl. XXVI.). The\r\nposterior and outer calcaneal surface in the Megathere (_e_) is broader\r\nin proportion to its length, continued further upwards upon the outward\r\nsurface, is consequently more convex in the transverse direction, and is\r\nnot bounded externally by so sharp and prominent a ridge as in the\r\nScelidothere. The protuberance from the inner surface of the astragalus\r\nis more compressed laterally in the Megathere than in the Scelidothere.\r\nThe correspondence between the astragali of the Mylodon(?) (Pl. XXVIII.\r\nfig. 6) and Megathere in the conformation of the under surface is so\r\nclose, that the few differences which exist will be sufficiently\r\nappreciated by an inspection of the figures.\r\n\r\nIn the Armadillo the astragalus, in consequence of the greater\r\nproduction of its anterior part, presents more of an angular than a\r\nquadrate figure; and the scaphoid articular surface, being\r\nproportionally carried forwards, is altogether separated from the\r\nanterior calcaneal surface. The posterior and inner calcaneal surface\r\nresembles that in the Scelidothere, but is less inclined upwards; and is\r\ncontinuous with the posterior part of the tibial articular surface.\r\n\r\nThus the astragalus in the structure of its two most important\r\narticulations, viz. that which receives the superincumbent weight from\r\nthe leg, and that which transmits it to the heel, presents a closer\r\ncorrespondence in the Scelidothere with that of the Dasypus, than with\r\nthat of the Megathere or Mylodon.\r\n\r\nThe ungueal phalanx of the Scelidothere before alluded to, is\r\nrepresented of the natural size in Pl. XXVII. The side view, fig. 3.\r\nshows the position of the articular surface on the proximal end, sloping\r\nobliquely towards the under surface, and overtopped by an obtuse\r\nprotuberance, calculated to impede any upward retraction of the claw:\r\nthe present joint, in fact, illustrates in every particular the argument\r\nby which Cuvier established the true affinities of the allied extinct\r\ngenus Megalonyx.[58]\r\n\r\nThe present phalanx is, however, less compressed, and less incurved than\r\nthose of the Megalonyx, which have been hitherto described; but it more\r\nresembles in these proportions one of the smaller, and presumed hinder,\r\nungueal phalanges of the Megatherium. The upper and lateral parts of the\r\nbone are rounded, and it gradually tapers to the apex, which is broken\r\noff. The osseous sheath for the claw is developed only at the under part\r\nof the bone: it presents the form of a thick flat plate of bone, with\r\nthe margin very regularly and obliquely bevelled off, and having a\r\nvertical process of bone attached lengthwise to the middle of its under\r\nsurface. This process must have served for the insertion of a very\r\npowerful flexor tendon. The figures of this bone preclude the necessity\r\nof any further verbal description.\r\n\r\nM. Lund lays most stress upon the argument founded on the inward\r\ninflection of the sole of the foot in the Megalonyx, and appeals with\r\ngreatest confidence to this structure in support of his hypothesis of\r\nthe scansorial habits of that extinct Edental.[59]\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that the Quadrumana derive advantage from this position\r\nof the foot in climbing trees, and that it is carried to excess in the\r\nSloths, which can only apply the outer edge of the foot to the ground.\r\nBut we may ask, was the inversion of the sole of the foot actually\r\ncarried to such an extent in the _Megalonyx_? And, admitting its\r\nexistence in an inferior degree, is it then conclusive as to the\r\nscansorial habits of that species?\r\n\r\nM. Lund expressly states that it is produced by a different structure\r\nand arrangement of the tarsal bones, from that which exists in the\r\nSloth, but he does not specify the nature of this difference.\r\n\r\nIf the astragalus, which I have referred with doubt to the _Megalonyx_,\r\ndo not actually belong to that genus, it is evidently part of a very\r\nclosely allied species. Now this astragalus, as we have seen, resembles\r\nmost closely that of the Megatherium; and since we may infer that the\r\ncalcaneum, scaphoides, and cuboides had a like correspondence, the\r\ninclination of the sole of the foot inwards must have been very slight,\r\nas I have determined from examination of the structure and co-adaptation\r\nof those bones in the incomplete skeleton of the Megatherium in the\r\nLondon College of Surgeons. Such an inclination of the foot may be\r\nconceived to have facilitated the bending of the long claws upon the\r\nsole, during the ordinary progressive movements of the animal, but it is\r\nquite insufficient to justify the conclusion, that it related to an\r\napplication of the hind-feet for the purposes of climbing.\r\n\r\nIt is not without interest again to call to mind the deviation of the\r\nstructure of the astragalus of the Scelidothere from the Megatherioid to\r\nthe Dasypodoid type of structure. For if the Megatherioid type of\r\nstructure had really been one suitable to the exigencies of climbing\r\nquadrupeds, it might have been expected to have exhibited the scansorial\r\nmodifications more decidedly, as the species diminished in stature; but\r\nas regards the instructive bone of the hind-foot, the modifications of\r\nwhich we have just been considering, this is by no means the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              DESCRIPTION OF A MUTILATED LOWER JAW OF THE\r\n                         MEGALONYX JEFFERSONII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding section an astralagus was described, which was regarded\r\nas belonging possibly to the same Edentate species as the jaw figured\r\nand described, p. 69, Pl. XVIII. and XIX., under the name of _Mylodon\r\nDarwinii_; but the same correspondence,—that of relative size,—renders\r\nit equally possible that this astragalus may belong to the species of\r\n_Megalonyx_ to which the lower jaw now under consideration appertains.\r\nThere could be no doubt, from its structure, that it was the astragalus\r\nof a gigantic species of the order _Bruta_, and of the _Megatherioid_\r\nfamily, and more nearly allied to the Megathere than is the\r\nScelidothere, but sufficiently distinct from both.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw, figured in Pl. XXIX., is the only fossil brought home by\r\nMr. Darwin that could be confidently referred to the genus _Megalonyx_;\r\nbut the form of the tooth in place on the right side of the jaw fully\r\njustifies this determination. The jaw itself is deeply and firmly\r\nimbedded in the matrix, so that only the upper or alveolar border is\r\nvisible. The coronoid and condyloid processes are broken away, and the\r\ntexture of the remaining part of the jaw was too friable, and adhered\r\ntoo firmly to the surrounding matrix to admit of more of its form being\r\nascertained than is figured.\r\n\r\nThere were four molars on each side of this jaw; the large oblique\r\nperforation near the fractured symphysis is the anterior extremity of\r\nthe wide dental canal. The forms of the alveoli are best preserved in\r\nthe right ramus: the first is the smallest, and seems to have contained\r\na tooth, of which the transverse section must have been simply\r\nelliptical: the second tooth is likewise laterally compressed, but the\r\ntransverse section is ovate, the great end being turned forwards: the\r\nthird socket presents a corresponding form, but a larger size: the\r\nfourth socket is too much mutilated to allow of a correct opinion being\r\nformed as to the shape of the tooth which it once contained. The natural\r\nsize of the tooth _in situ_, and of the adjoining socket, is given in\r\nPl. XXIX., fig. 2. The difference of form which the jaw of the Megalonyx\r\npresents, as compared with that of the Mylodon, especially in the\r\ngreater recedence of the two horizontal rami from each other, will be\r\nappreciated by comparing Pl. XVIII. with Pl. XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     DESCRIPTION OF A FRAGMENT OF THE SKULL AND OF THE TEETH OF THE\r\n                          MEGATHERIUM CUVIERI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the full, accurate, and elaborate accounts of the\r\nskeleton of the Megatherium given by Bru,[60] Cuvier,[61] Pander and\r\nD’Alton,[62] and Mr. Clift,[63] the fragments of this most gigantic of\r\nquadrupeds brought home by Mr. Darwin, possess much interest, and have\r\nadded, what could hardly have been anticipated, important information as\r\nto the dental system, whereby an error in the generic character of the\r\nMegatherium has been corrected.\r\n\r\nThe fragments here alluded to are portions of the skull of three\r\nfull-grown Megatheres: the most perfect part of which affords a view of\r\nthe posterior, and of part of the basal surface, which regions of the\r\ncranium have not hitherto been elsewhere figured or described, (Pl.\r\nXXX.)\r\n\r\nThe plane of the occipital foramen forms with that of the base of the\r\nskull an angle of 140°, the plane of the posterior surface of the skull\r\nforms with the basal plane an angle of 68°. The occipital condyles are\r\ntherefore terminal, or form the most posterior parts of the cranium. The\r\nextent of their convex curvature in the antero-posterior direction,\r\nwhich equals that of a semicircle, indicates that the Megatherium\r\npossessed considerable freedom and extent of motion of the head. The\r\ncondyles are not extended in the lateral direction so far as in the\r\nToxodon; their axis is more oblique than in the Glossotherium, and their\r\ninternal surface is more parallel with the axis of the skull, the\r\nforamen magnum not presenting that infundibuliform expansion which is so\r\ncharacteristic of the Glossotherium. The occipital condyles resemble\r\nmost in form and position those of the Scelidotherium; but in the angle\r\nof the occipital plane the Megatherium is intermediate between the\r\nScelidothere and Glossothere. The ex-occipitals terminate laterally and\r\ninferiorly, each in a short, but strong obtuse process. The posterior\r\nplane of the skull is traversed by a strong arched intermuscular crest,\r\nwhich forms the upper boundary of a pretty deep fossa, which is divided\r\nby a median vertical ridge, extending downwards to within an inch of the\r\nupper margin of the foramen magnum. A second strong obtuse transversely\r\narched ridge curves over the first, and forms the upper boundary of the\r\nposterior or occipital region of the skull: the interspace between the\r\ntwo transverse ridges is very irregular, and indicates the firm\r\nimplantation of powerful nuchal muscles or ligaments, (Pl. XXX. fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nIn the configuration and angle of the occipital plane the Megatherium\r\nindicates the same general correspondence with the Edentate type, which\r\nhas been pointed out in the descriptions of the crania of the\r\nGlossothere and Scelidothere: and the resemblance to the Scelidothere is\r\nnot less striking in the small proportional size of the cranium in this\r\nquadruped, which surpasses the rest of its class in so great a degree in\r\nthe colossal proportions of its hinder parts.\r\n\r\nHaving detected in the base of the skull of the Scelidothere an\r\narticular semicircular pit for the head of the styloglossal bone,\r\nsimilar to, but relatively smaller than, that remarkable one in the\r\nskull of the Glossothere, it became a matter of interest to determine\r\nwhether this structure, which does not exist in any of the existing\r\nEdentals, should likewise be present in the gigantic type of the\r\nMegatherioid family. The result of a careful removal of the matrix from\r\nthe basal region of one of the cranial fragments of the Megatherium was\r\nthe detection of this articular cavity, in each temporal bone in the\r\nsame relative position as in the Glossothere and Scelidothere. The\r\nstyloid articular cavity is relatively smaller, and shallower, than in\r\nthe Glossothere, its proportions being much the same as those of the\r\nScelidothere. The cranial or posterior extremity of the stylo-hyoid bone\r\nin the Scelidotherium is bent upwards at an obtuse angle (Pl. XXI.), and\r\nterminates in an articular ball which rotates in this cavity. The size\r\nof this bone, and its mode of articulation, indicates great power and\r\nmuscularity of tongue in the Megatherioids, and calls to mind the\r\nimportance of that organ in the Giraffe, which subsists on the same kind\r\nof food as that which I have supposed to have supported the\r\nMegatherioids, although the general organization of these animals and\r\nthe mode in which the foliage was brought within reach of the tongue are\r\nas opposite as can well be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe anterior condyloid foramen presents scarcely one-half the absolute\r\nsize of that of the Glossothere, whence we may infer a correspondingly\r\ninferior development of the tongue in the Megathere. The fractured\r\nparietes of the cranial cavity of the Megatherium every where exhibit\r\nevidences of the great extent of the air-cells or sinuses continued from\r\nthe nasal cavity: on the basilar aspect of the cranium they extend as\r\nfar back as the jugular foramina: the whole of the basi-sphenoid being\r\nthus excavated, and permeable to air, derived from the sphenoid sinuses,\r\n(Pl. XXX. fig. 2.). The vertical diameter of the cranial cavity is four\r\ninches, eight lines; its transverse diameter, which is greatest in the\r\nposterior third part of the cavity, corresponding with the posterior\r\npart of the cerebrum is six inches: from the indications afforded by the\r\nremains of the cranial cavity in Mr. Darwin’s specimens, I conclude that\r\nthe brain of the Megatherium was more depressed, and upon the whole,\r\nsmaller by nearly one-half than that of the Elephant; but with the\r\ncerebellum relatively larger, and situated more posteriorly with\r\nrelation to the cerebral hemispheres: whence it may be concluded that\r\nthe Megatherium was a creature of less intelligence, and with the\r\ncommand of fewer resources, or a less varied instinct than the Elephant.\r\n\r\nIt has been usual to characterize the Megatherium, in conformity with\r\nthe concurrent descriptions of Bru, Cuvier, and D’Alton, by the dental\r\nformula of _molares_ ⁴⁄₄ ⁴⁄₄, i. e. by the presence of four grinding\r\nteeth on each side of the upper, as of the lower jaw. It was the\r\nagreement of the excellent authorities above cited in this statement,\r\nwhich induced Mr. Clift and myself to regard a single detached tooth,\r\nwhich formed part of the valuable collection of remains of the\r\nMegatherium deposited in the Hunterian Museum by Sir Woodbine Parish, as\r\nbeing, from its comparatively small size, the tooth of either a younger\r\nindividual or of a smaller species of Megatherium. Upon clearing away\r\nthe matrix from the palatal and alveolar surface of one of the cranial\r\nfragments of the Megatherium in Mr. Darwin’s collection, I was gratified\r\nby the detection of the crown of a fifth molar, corresponding in size\r\nand form with the detached tooth, above alluded to: its small size, and\r\nits position have doubtless occasioned its being over-looked in the\r\ncranium of the great skeleton at Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe anterior molar of the upper jaw presents a nearly semicircular\r\ntransverse section, with the angles rounded off; the three succeeding\r\nteeth are four-sided, with the transverse somewhat exceeding the\r\nantero-posterior diameter: they are rather longer and larger than the\r\nfirst: the last molar is likewise four-sided, but presents a sudden\r\ndiminution of diameter, and is relatively broader. The following are the\r\nrespective dimensions of the upper maxillary teeth.\r\n\r\n                    First      Second     Third      Fourth     Fifth\r\n                    Molar.     Molar.

XXXI. The convexity of the curve of the first,\r\nsecond and third molars is directed forwards; the fourth is straight,\r\nits anterior surface only describing a slight convexity in the vertical\r\ndirection; the fifth tooth is curved, but in a contrary direction to the\r\nothers; and the bases of the five molars thus present a general\r\nconvergence towards a point a little way behind the middle of the\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nThe next peculiarity to be noticed in these remarkable teeth is the\r\ngreat length of the pulp-cavity (_d_), the apex of which is parallel\r\nwith the alveolar margin of the jaw: a transverse fissure is continued\r\nfrom this apex to the middle concavity of the working surface of the\r\ntooth, which is thus divided into two parts. Each of these parts\r\nconsists of three distinct substances,—a central part analogous to the\r\nbody or bone of the tooth or ‘dentine,’ a peripheral and nearly equally\r\nthick layer of _cæmentum_, and an intermediate thinner stratum of a\r\ndenser substance, which is described in Mr. Clift’s memoir on the\r\nMegatherium as ‘enamel,’ and to which substance in the compound teeth of\r\nthe Elephant, it is analogous both in its relative situation, and\r\nrelative density to the other constituents.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic examinations of thin and transparent slices of the tooth of\r\nthe Megatherium prove, however, that the dense layer separating the\r\ninternal substance from the cæmentum is not enamel, but presents the\r\nsame structure as the hard ‘dentine’ or ivory of the generality of\r\nMammalian teeth; and corresponds with the thin cylinder of hard\r\n‘dentine’ in the tooth of the Sloth. No species of the Order _Bruta_ has\r\ntrue enamel entering into the composition of its teeth; but the\r\nmodifications of structure which the teeth present in the different\r\ngenera of this order are considerable, and their complexity is not less\r\nthan that of the enamelled teeth of the Herbivorous Pachyderms and\r\nRuminantia, in consequence of the introduction of a dental substance\r\ninto their composition corresponding in structure with that of the teeth\r\nof the _Myliobates_, _Psammodus_, and other cartilaginous fishes.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic investigation of the structure of the teeth of the\r\nMegatherium was undertaken chiefly with the view of comparing this\r\nstructure with that of the teeth of the Sloth and Armadillo, and of thus\r\nobtaining an insight into the food, and an additional test of the real\r\nnature of the disputed affinities of the Megatherium. The central part\r\nof the tooth (_c._ Pl. XXXI.) consists of a coarse ivory, like the\r\ncorresponding part of the tooth of the Sloth. It is traversed throughout\r\nby medullary canals ¹⁄₁₅₀₀ of an inch in diameter, which are continued\r\nfrom the pulp-cavity, and proceed, at an angle of 50°, to the plane of\r\nthe dense ivory, parallel to each other, with a slightly undulating\r\ncourse, having regular interspaces, equal to one and a half diameters of\r\ntheir own areæ, and generally anastomosing in pairs by a loop of which\r\nthe convexity is turned towards the origin of the tubes of the fine\r\ndentine, as if each pair so joined consisted of a continuous reflected\r\ncanal, (_c._ fig. 1, Pl. XXXII.) The loops are generally formed close to\r\nthe fine dentine. In a few situations I have observed one of the\r\nmedullary canals continued across the fine dentine, and anastomosing\r\nwith the corresponding canals of the cæmentum. The interspaces of the\r\nmedullary canals of the coarse dentine are principally occupied by\r\ncalcigerous tubes which have an irregular course, anastomose\r\nreticularly, and terminate in very fine cells. The more regular and\r\nparallel calcigerous tubes, which constitute the thin layer of hard\r\ndentine, are given off from the convexity of the terminal loops of the\r\nmedullary canals. The course of these tubes (_b._ fig. 1, Pl. XXXII.) is\r\nrather more transversely to the axis of the tooth than the medullary\r\ncanals from which they are continued. They run parallel to each other,\r\nbut with minute undulations throughout their course, in which they are\r\nseparated by interspaces equal to one and a half their own diameter. As\r\nthey approach the cæmentum they divide and sub-divide, and grow more\r\nwavy and irregular: their terminal branches take on a bent direction,\r\nand form anastomoses, dilate into small cells, and many are seen to\r\nbecome continuous with the radiating fibres or tubes of the cells or\r\ncorpuscles of the contiguous cæmentum. This substance enters largely\r\ninto the constitution of the compound tooth of the Megatherium: it is\r\ncharacterized, like the cæmentum of the Elephant’s grinder, by the\r\npresence of numerous radiated cells, or purkingian corpuscles, scattered\r\nthroughout its substance, but may be distinguished by wide medullary\r\ncanals which traverse it in a direction parallel with each other, and\r\nforming a slight angle with the transverse axis of the tooth. These\r\ncanals are wider than those of the central coarse dentine, their\r\ndiameter being ¹⁄₁₂₀₀th of an inch; they are separated by interspaces\r\nequal to from four to six of their own diameters, divide a few times\r\ndichotomously in their course, and finally anastomose in loops, the\r\nconvexity of which is directed towards, and in most cases is in close\r\ncontiguity with, the layer of dense dentine.\r\n\r\nFine calcigerous tubes are every where given off at right angles from\r\nthe medullary canals of the cæmentum, which form a rich reticulation in\r\ntheir interspaces, and a direct continuation between the loops of the\r\nmedullary canals and the calcigerous tubes of the dense dentine. The\r\ncæmentum differs from the coarse dentine in the larger size and wider\r\ninterspaces of its medullary canals, and by the presence of the\r\nbone-corpuscles in their interspaces; but they are brought into organic\r\ncommunication with each other, not only by means of the tubes of the\r\ndense dentine, but by occasional continuity of the medullary canals\r\nacross that substance. The tooth of the Megatherium thus offers an\r\nunequivocal example of a course of nutriment from the dentine to the\r\ncæmentum, and reciprocally. Retzius observes with respect to the human\r\ntooth, that “the fine tubes of the cæmentum enter into immediate\r\ncommunications with the cells and tubes of the dentine (zahnknochen), so\r\nthat this part can obtain from without the requisite humours after the\r\ncentral pulp has almost ceased to exist.” In the Megatherium, however,\r\nthose anastomoses have not to perform a vicarious office, since the pulp\r\nmaintains its full size and functional activity during the whole period\r\nof the animal’s existence. It relates to the higher organized condition,\r\nand greater degree of vitality of the entire grinder in that extinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe conical cavities (_d._ Pl. XXXI.) attest the size and form of the\r\npersistent pulp; the diameter of its base is equal to the part of the\r\ncrown of the tooth which is formed by the coarse and fine dentine. From\r\nthe gradual thinning off and final disappearance of these substances as\r\nthey reach the base of the tooth, I conclude that they were both formed\r\nat the expense of the pulp. The fine tubes and cells must have been\r\nexcavated in its peripheral layer for the reception of the hardening\r\nsalts of the dense dentine, and the rest converted into the parallel\r\nseries of medullary canals with their respective systems of calcigerous\r\ntubes, in a manner closely analogous to the development of the entire\r\ntooth of the Orycteropus. The coarser dentine of the tooth of the\r\nMegatherium differs, in fact, from the entire tooth of the\r\n_Orycteropus_, only in that the parallel medullary canals and their\r\nradiating calcigerous tubes are not separated from the contiguous canals\r\nby a distinct layer of cæmentum, and that the medullary canals\r\nanastomose at their peripheral extremities. The wide spaces, (_e._ Pl.\r\nXXXI.) indicate the thickness of the dental capsule by the ossification\r\nof which the exterior stratum of cement was formed. It was not until I\r\nknew the true structure of the tooth of the Megatherium, that I could\r\ncomprehend the mode of its formation. The parallel layers of enamel in\r\nthe Elephant’s grinder are formed, as is well known, by membranous\r\nplates passing from the coronal end of the closed capsule towards the\r\nbase of the tooth; but a certain extent of enamel can only thus be\r\nformed, and when the crown of the grinder has once protruded, and come\r\ninto use, the enamel cannot be added to. The modification of the\r\nstructure of the tooth of the Megatherium readily permits the\r\nuninterrupted and continuous formation of the dense substance which is\r\nanalogous to the enamel of the Elephant’s grinder.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the question of the respective affinities of the\r\nMegatherium to the Bradypodoid or Dasypodoid families, the result of\r\nthis examination of the teeth speaks strongly for its closer\r\nrelationship with the former group: the Megalonyx, Mylodon, and\r\nScelidotherium, in like manner correspond in the structure of their\r\nteeth with the Sloth, and differ from the Armadillo.\r\n\r\nIf from a similarity of dental structure we may predicate a similarity\r\nof food, it may reasonably be conjectured that the leaves and soft\r\nsucculent sprouts of trees may have been the staple diet of the\r\nMegatherioid quadrupeds, as of the existing Sloths. Their enormous\r\nclaws, I conclude, from the fossorial character of the powerful\r\nmechanism by which they were worked, to have been employed, not, as in\r\nthe Sloths, to carry the animal to the food, but to bring the food\r\nwithin the reach of the animal, by uprooting the trees on which it grew.\r\n\r\nIn the remains of the Megatherium we have evidence of the frame-work of\r\na quadruped equal to the task of undermining and hauling down the\r\nlargest members of a tropical forest. In the latter operation it is\r\nobvious that the immediate application of the anterior extremities to\r\nthe trunk of the tree would demand a corresponding fulcrum, to be\r\neffectual, and it is the necessity for an adequate basis of support and\r\nresistance to such an application of the fore extremities which gives\r\nthe explanation to the anomalous development of the pelvis, tail, and\r\nhinder extremities in the Megatherioid quadrupeds. No wonder, therefore,\r\nthat their type of structure is so peculiar; for where shall we now find\r\nquadrupeds equal, like them, to the habitual task of uprooting trees for\r\nfood?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  DESCRIPTION OF FRAGMENTS OF BONES, AND OF OSSEOUS TESSELATED DERMAL\r\n                      COVERING OF LARGE EDENTATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now determined that there once existed in South America, besides\r\nthe Megatherium, the Megalonyx, and the allied genera described in the\r\npreceding pages of the present work, gigantic species of the order\r\n_Bruta_ belonging to the Armadillo family, and defended, like the small\r\nexisting representatives of that family, by a tesselated bony dermal\r\ncovering. The largest known species of these extinct _Dasypodidæ_ is the\r\n_Glyptodon clavipes_, of which the armour and parts of the skeleton have\r\nbeen described by MM. Weiss and D’Alton in the Berlin Transactions for\r\n1827 and 1834: and the generic and specific characters and name, with an\r\naccount of the dental system, and bones of the extremities, were\r\nrecorded in the Geological Proceedings for March 1839. It would seem\r\nthat parts of the same, or a nearly allied gigantic species were\r\ndescribed in the same year by M. Lund; under the name of _Hoplophorus_.\r\nOf the valuable and interesting discoveries of this able Naturalist I\r\nregret that I was not aware until the appearance of a notice of them in\r\nthe Comptes Rendus for April, 1839.[64] Amongst the fragments of bony\r\ntesselated armour in Mr. Darwin’s collection are a few pieces which were\r\nfound by him, associated with remains of Toxodon and Glossotherium near\r\nthe Rio Negro in Banda Oriental.[65] These fragments, if we may judge\r\nfrom their thickness, must have belonged to an animal at least as large\r\nas the _Glyptodon clavipes_; but the pattern differs in the greater\r\nequality of size of the component tesseræ. The thickness of the largest\r\nfragment is one inch and a half, the tesseræ vary in diameter from one\r\ninch to half an inch, and are separated by grooves about two lines in\r\ndepth, and two in diameter. The pattern formed by the anastomosis of\r\nthese grooves is an irregular net-work; the contour of the tesseræ is\r\neither unevenly subcircular, hexagonal, pentagonal, or even four-sided;\r\nwith the sides more or less unequal. In those portions of this armour,\r\nwhere one of the tesseræ exceeds the contiguous ones in size, the\r\nimagination may readily conceive it to be the centre of a rosette,\r\naround which the smaller ones arrange themselves, but there is no\r\nregular system of rosettes, as in the portions of the dermal armour of\r\nthe Glyptodon figured by Weiss, and those brought to England by Sir\r\nWoodbine Parish, in which the central piece is double the size of the\r\nmarginal ones.\r\n\r\nThe portions of the tesselated bony dermal covering of a Dasypodoid\r\nquadruped, figured in Pl. XXXII. figs. 5 and 4, of the natural size,\r\nwere discovered folded round the middle and ungueal phalanges, figs. 2\r\nand 3, at Punta Alta, in Bahia Blanca, in an earthy bed interstratified\r\nwith the conglomerate containing the remains of the fossil Edentals.\r\n\r\nIn one of these fragments, measuring six inches long by five broad, the\r\ntesseræ are arranged in rosettes, and so closely correspond in size and\r\npattern with the bony armour described by M. Lund, as characterizing his\r\nspecies, _Hoplophorus euphractus_, that I feel no hesitation in\r\nreferring them to that animal. One of the pattern rosettes is figured at\r\nfig. 4, together with the thickness of the armour at this part, and the\r\ncoarse tubulo-cellular structure of the bone. Another portion of dermal\r\narmour from the same locality, gives the pattern shown in fig. 5, formed\r\nby square or pentagonal tesseræ, arranged in transverse rows; it is\r\ncertain that this portion of armour belonged to the same animal as the\r\npreceding piece; and probably that it constituted part of the transverse\r\ndorsal bands of the _Hoplophorus_.\r\n\r\nThe middle and ungueal phalanx, as well as the portions of armour, are\r\ngiven of the natural size, in Pl. XXXII. The upper and outer surface of\r\nthe phalanx, is shown in fig. 2. It is smooth and flat; joins the inner\r\nsurface by a sharp edge, which runs along the upper and inner side of\r\nthe bone; and passes by a gradual convexity to the under surface; the\r\nridge corresponding with the base of the claw, is feebly developed at\r\nthe under and lateral parts of the base of the claw. Below the double\r\ntrochlear joint for the middle phalanx, there are two articular surfaces\r\nfor two large sesamoid bones.\r\n\r\nThe middle phalanx corresponds in its small antero-posterior diameter\r\nand wedge-shape, with that of the great Glyptodon: but the terminal\r\nphalanx is longer and deeper, in proportion to its breadth.\r\n\r\nAmong the collection of fossils from Punta Alta, in Bahia Blanca, there\r\nis an interesting fragment of the head of a gigantic animal of the\r\nEdentate order, including the glenoid cavity, and part of the zygomatic\r\nprocess of the left side. The articular surface for the lower jaw,\r\nexhibits, in its flatness, extent, and the absence of a posterior ridge,\r\nthe well-marked characteristics of this part of the Edental structure.\r\nIt measures two inches four lines in the transverse, and two inches two\r\nlines in the antero-posterior diameter. The commencement of the\r\nzygomatic process presents a vertical diameter of two inches, and a\r\ntransverse diameter of eight lines at the thickest part. It is slightly\r\nconcave at its lower border, and convex above. The small portion of the\r\ncranial parietes, which is preserved, exhibits the cellular structure\r\nconsequent upon the great extension and development of the nasal\r\nair-sinuses: this condition of the cranial parietes, has already been\r\nnoticed in the description of the more perfect skulls of the large\r\nextinct Edentata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                NOTICE OF FRAGMENTS OF MOLAR TEETH OF A\r\n                               MASTODON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the remains of this gigantic extinct Pachyderm, observed by Mr.\r\nDarwin at Santa Fé, in Entre Rios, and on the banks of the Tercero, the\r\nfragments of the teeth and portions of the skeleton which reached\r\nEngland, are not sufficient to lead to a determination of the species;\r\nbut sufficiently prove it to have been nearly allied, if not identical,\r\nwith the _Mastodon angustidens_ of Cuvier, and unquestionably distinct\r\nfrom the _Mastodon giganteum_ of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 NOTICE OF THE REMAINS OF A SPECIES OF\r\n                                 EQUUS,\r\n\r\n  _Found associated with the extinct Edentals and Toxodon at Punta Alta,\r\n in Bahia Blanca, and with the Mastodon and Toxodon at Santa Fé, in Entre\r\n                                  Rios._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of these remains is a superior molar tooth of the right side;\r\nit was embedded in the quartz shingle, formed of pebbles strongly\r\ncemented together with calcareous matter, which adhered as closely to\r\nthe tooth in question, as the corresponding matrix did to the associated\r\nfossil remains. The tooth was as completely fossilized as the remains of\r\nthe Mylodon, Megatherium, and Scelidothere; and was so far decomposed,\r\nthat in the attempt to detach the adherent matrix, it became partially\r\nresolved into its component curved lamellæ. Every point of comparison\r\nthat could be established proved it to differ from the tooth of the\r\ncommon _Equus Caballus_ only in a slight inferiority of size.\r\n\r\nThe second evidence of the co-existence of the horse with the extinct\r\nMammals of the tertiary epoch of South America reposes on a more perfect\r\ntooth, likewise of the upper jaw, from the red argillaceous earth of the\r\nPampas at Bajada de Santa Fé, in the Province of Entre Rios.[66]\r\n\r\nThis tooth is figured at Pl. XXXII. fig. 13 and 14, from which the\r\nanatomist can judge of its close correspondence with a middle molar of\r\nthe left side of the upper jaw.\r\n\r\nThis tooth agreed so closely in colour and condition with the remains of\r\nthe Mastodon and Toxodon, from the same locality, that I have no doubt\r\nrespecting the contemporaneous existence of the individual horse, of\r\nwhich it once formed part.\r\n\r\nThis evidence of the former existence of a genus, which, as regards\r\nSouth America, had become extinct, and has a second time been introduced\r\ninto that Continent, is not one of the least interesting fruits of Mr.\r\nDarwin’s palæontological discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n DESCRIPTION OF REMAINS OF RODENTIA, INCLUDING THE JAWS AND TEETH OF AN\r\n                           EXTINCT SPECIES OF\r\n                               CTENOMYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fragment of the upper jaw, figured in Pl. XXXII. fig. 6, exhibits\r\nthe first and second molar _in situ_, and the socket of the third and\r\nfourth molar, of a Rodent, which by the form and number of the upper\r\nmaxillary teeth is referable to the genus Ctenomys. The molars are a\r\nlittle larger, the longitudinal groove on their external surface is\r\nsomewhat deeper, and the last molar is relatively wider than in the\r\nexisting subterraneous species,—the Tucutucu (_Ctenomys Brasiliensis_,\r\nBl.), of whose habits so interesting an account is given in the\r\ndescription of the Mammalia of the present Collection (No. IV. p. 79).\r\nThe form of the grinding surface of the first and second upper molar is\r\nshown below the fig. 6, and three views of the second grinder are given\r\nat figs. 7, 8, and 9. The fragment of the lower jaw of the same fossil\r\nRodent is figured at fig. 10 and 11. The long anterior incisor is\r\nrelatively narrower than in the _Ctenomys Brasiliensis_. I have not had\r\nthe means of comparing this fossil with the _Ctenomys Magellanicus_; but\r\nsince it is probable that the _Ct. Magellanicus_ may not be specifically\r\ndifferent from the _Ct. Brasiliensis_, it may be concluded that the\r\npresent fossil is equally distinct from both.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe portion of the right hind-foot of the Rodent figured at fig. 12,\r\nincludes the calcaneum, astragalus, cuboides, external and middle\r\ncuneiform bones, and the metatarsals and proximal phalanges of the toes\r\ncorresponding with the three middle toes of five-toed quadrupeds. The\r\nmetatarsals are chiefly remarkable for the well-developed\r\ndouble-trochlear articular surface, and intermediate ridge. These\r\nremains, as well as the jaws and teeth of the Ctenomys, were discovered\r\nat Monte Hermoso in Bahia Blanca.\r\n\r\nIn the same reddish earthy stratum of that locality, Mr. Darwin\r\ndiscovered the decomposed molar of a Rodent, equalling in size, and\r\nclosely resembling in the disposition of its oblique component laminæ,\r\nthe hinder molar of the Capybara (_Hydrochærus_). The fossil differs,\r\nhowever, in the greater relative breadth of the component laminæ.\r\n\r\nI have, lastly, to notice the head of a femur, and some fragments of\r\npelvic bones from the same formation which bear the same proportion to\r\nthe tooth above alluded to, as subsists between the teeth and bones of\r\nthe Capybara, and which are sufficient to prove that there once has\r\nexisted in South America a species of the family _Caviidæ_, as large as\r\nthe present _Capybara_, but now apparently extinct.\r\n\r\nThis fact, together with the greater part of those which have been\r\nrecorded in the foregoing pages of the present work, establishes the\r\ncorrespondence, in regard to the characteristic type, which exists\r\nbetween the present and extinct animals of the South American Continent:\r\nwe have abundant evidence likewise of the greater number of generic and\r\nspecific modifications of these fundamental types which the animals of a\r\nformer epoch exhibited, and also of the vastly superior size which some\r\nof the species attained.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it has been shewn that some of the present laws of the\r\ngeographical distribution of animals would not have been applicable to\r\nSouth America, at the period when the Megatherioids, Toxodon, and\r\nMacrauchenia existed: since the Horse, and according to M. Lund, the\r\nAntelope and the Hyæna, were then associated with those more strictly\r\nSouth American forms. The Horse, which, as regards the American\r\ncontinent, had once become extinct, has again been introduced, and now\r\nranges in countless troops over the pampas and savannahs of the new\r\nworld. If the small Opossums of South America had been in like manner\r\nimported into Europe, and were now established like the Squirrels and\r\nDormice in the forests of France, an analogous case would exist to that\r\nof the Horse in South America, as the fossil Didelphys of Montmartre\r\nproves.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the geological contemporaneity of the fossils collected\r\nby him, Mr. Darwin subjoins the following observations:—\r\n\r\n  “The remains of the following animals were embedded together at Punta\r\n  Alta in Bahia Blanca:—The _Megatherium Cuvierii_, _Megalonyx\r\n  Jeffersonii_, _Mylodon Darwinii_, _Scelidotherium leptocephalum_,\r\n  _Toxodon Platensis (?)_ a Horse and a small Dasypodoid quadruped,\r\n  mentioned p. 107; at St. Fé in Entre Rios, a Horse, a Mastodon,\r\n  _Toxodon Platensis_, and some large animal with a tesselated osseous\r\n  dermal covering; on the banks of the Tercero the Mastodon, Toxodon,\r\n  and, according to the Jesuit Falkner, some animal with the same kind\r\n  of covering; near the Rio Negro in Banda Oriental, the _Toxodon\r\n  Platensis_, Glossotherium, and some animal with the same kind of\r\n  covering. To these two latter animals the _Glyptodon clavipes_,\r\n  described by Mr. Owen in the Geological Transactions, may, from the\r\n  locality where it was discovered, and from the similarity of the\r\n  deposit which covers the greater part of Banda Oriental, almost\r\n  certainly be added, as having been contemporaneous. From nearly the\r\n  same reasons, it is probable that the Rodents found at Monte Hermoso\r\n  in Bahia Blanca, co-existed with the several gigantic mammifers from\r\n  Punta Alta. I have, also, shown in the Introduction, that the\r\n  _Macrauchenia Patachonica_, must have been coeval, or nearly so, with\r\n  the last mentioned animals. Although we have no evidence of the\r\n  geological age of the deposits in some of the localities just\r\n  specified, yet from the presence of the same fossil mammifers in\r\n  others, of the age of which we have fair means of judging, (in\r\n  relation to the usual standard of comparison, of the amount of change\r\n  in the specific forms of the invertebrate inhabitants of the sea,) we\r\n  may safely infer that _most_ of the animals described in this volume,\r\n  and likewise the Glyptodon, were strictly contemporaneous, and that\r\n  _all_ lived at about the same very recent period in the earth’s\r\n  history. Moreover, as some of the fossil animals, discovered in such\r\n  extraordinary numbers by M. Lund in the caves of Brazil, are identical\r\n  or closely related with some of those, which lately lived together in\r\n  La Plata and Patagonia, a certain degree of light is thus thrown on\r\n  the antiquity of the ancient Fauna of Brazil, which otherwise would\r\n  have been left involved in complete darkness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LONDON:\r\n\r\n                     PRINTED BY STEWART AND MURRAY,\r\n\r\n                              OLD BAILEY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pl.

The term is quoted from the\r\n  Systema Naturæ, Ed. xii. p. 24. Linnæus first divides Mammalia into\r\n  three groups, according to modifications of the locomotive organs,\r\n  viz. _Unguiculata_, _Ungulata_, _Mutica_, and subdivides these,\r\n  according to modifications of the dentary organs, into the orders,\r\n  _Bruat_, _Glires_, _Primates_, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Besides the relation to _food requiring much comminution_, which teeth\r\n  with persistent pulps bear, they are also connected with the\r\n  _longevity of the individual_. The term of life in a herbivorous\r\n  animal, with grinders of temporary growth, is, of necessity, dependent\r\n  on the duration of these essential aids to nutrition; thus, a sheep\r\n  generally wears down its grinders in twelve years, and its natural\r\n  term of life is consequently limited to about that period.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Μακρος _longus_, αυχην _cervix_: from the latter word Illiger derived\r\n  _Auchenia_, his generic name of the Llama, Vicugna, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  In the seventh cervical vertebra of the Camel, as in many other\r\n  Mammalia, there is no perforation in any part for the vertebral\r\n  arteries. In a Vicugna, I find the same structure; but in a Llama, the\r\n  side of the body of the seventh cervical vertebra is perforated\r\n  longitudinally on the right side. In the Camel, the vertebral arteries\r\n  pierce the sixth cervical vertebra, immediately below the superior\r\n  transverse processes, and pass obliquely to the anterior aperture of\r\n  the cervical canal, where they emerge beneath the anterior oblique\r\n  processes, and then enter the spinal canal of the fifth cervical\r\n  vertebra, as described in the text.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Cuvier, Ossemens Fossiles, iii. p. 238.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Loc. cit. p. 234.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Loc. cit. p. 235.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Loc. cit. p. 237.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Loc. cit. p. 232.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  See Ossem.

Ainsi dans les\r\n  animaux qui vivent de chairs, substances filamenteuses qui ne peuvent\r\n  être écrasées, mais seulement coupées et dechirées, le mouvement de la\r\n  mâchoire inférieure ne peut s’exécuter que de haut en bas. Dans les\r\n  herbivores, les frugivores et les granivores, comme le principal\r\n  mouvement est celui de broiement pour écraser, comprimer les herbes et\r\n  les fruits, pour briser les grains et les réduire, en pâte, le\r\n  mouvement des mâchoires se fait encore de droite à gauche, et\r\n  réciproquement, on en même temps, de devant en arrière, en un mot,\r\n  dans un plan horizontal autant que dans un vertical: les uns\r\n  représentent des ciseaux, les autres des meules de moulin.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  In the monotrematous Echidna, the large canal for the lingual nerve\r\n  has a widely different direction and course from that in the placental\r\n  Edentata.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  Transactions of the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, vol. iv. p.\r\n  246.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Its relations to the Edentata, previously conjectured by Dr. Wistar,\r\n  are proved in the Annales du Muséum, tom. v. p. 358; its more\r\n  immediate affinities as an annectant form in that group are discussed\r\n  in the edition of the Ossem.

M. de\r\n  Blainville speaks of a cast of a fragment of a lower jaw “portant\r\n  encore _cinq_ dents en série;” as having been transmitted to the\r\n  Museum of the Garden of Plants from North America, together with other\r\n  bones, all of which he refers to the genus _Megalonyx_; M. de\r\n  Blainville does not describe these teeth, which is to be regretted,\r\n  inasmuch as, if he be correct in regard to their number, which can\r\n  hardly be doubted, and if he wrote with any clear and definite ideas\r\n  of the generic characters of _Megalonyx_, this would indicate that\r\n  _Megalonyx_ differed generically both from _Megatherium_ and _Mylodon_\r\n  in a more important dental character than has hitherto been suspected\r\n  (See “Comptes Rendus, &c.” 1839, No. V. p. 142.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Harlan also indicates differences in certain parts of the skeleton\r\n  of the New York fossils as compared with his _Meg^x. laqueatus_; but\r\n  thinks them probably due to a difference in the age of the\r\n  individuals: he says “There is also in Mr. Graves’ collection, in New\r\n  York, a tibia, nearly perfect from the right leg; the segment of a\r\n  flattened sphere, on which the external condyle of the femur moves, is\r\n  rather more depressed, than in the specimen from Big-bone-cave. Other\r\n  marks and peculiarities are observable on this bone, not found on that\r\n  of the _Megalonyx laqueatus_ of Big-bone-cave, but they are probably\r\n  due to a difference in the age of the individuals.” Loc. cit. p. 335.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Μυλη, _mola_; οδους, _dens_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  If the lower jaw of _Mylodon Harlani_, bears the same proportion to\r\n  its teeth as does that of _Mylodon Darwinii_, it must be about two\r\n  feet in length.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  See Proceedings of the Geological Society, March 1839, and Parish’s\r\n  Buenos Ayres, p. 178, _b_, Pl. 1, fig. 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Σκελις, _femur_; Θηριον, _bellua_; in allusion to the disproportionate\r\n  size of the thigh-bone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  This beach is covered at spring tides; many parts of the skeleton were\r\n  encrusted with recent _Flustræ_, and small marine shells were lodged\r\n  in the crevices between the bones.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  It requires little stretch of imagination to conceive that this more\r\n  complex posterior tooth (Pl. XXIII., fig. 4, 4) in the lower jaw is\r\n  the representative of the two smaller posterior teeth (ib. fig. 3, 4,\r\n  and 5) of the upper jaw conjoined.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Lund, Videnskabernes Selskabs, Natur.: og Mathem.

The brief allusion to the\r\n  astragalus of the Megalonyx in M. Lund’s Memoir does not afford the\r\n  means of determining with certainty this point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  See the figures of this bone, given by Cuvier in Pl. x. and xi.\r\n  Ossemens Fossiles, vol. v. part i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Ossemens Fossiles, vol. v. part i. p. 163.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  For the translation of the following passage, and of others alluded to\r\n  in the present work, from the original Danish Memoir of M. Lund, loc.\r\n  cit., I am much indebted to the Rev. W. Bilton, M.A. &c. &c.:—\r\n\r\n  “Thus in every point of comparison we have instituted between the\r\n  organization of burrowers and climbers; we have seen that the\r\n  Megalonyx constantly differs from the former and resembles the latter;\r\n  but the point to which I last alluded (the obliquity of foot), I\r\n  consider to be quite decisive.\r\n\r\n  “There is one other point in its organization, which is not quite\r\n  without weight in reference to our present inquiry,—I mean its\r\n  unusually powerful tail. Now, it is certainly true that many animals\r\n  which are not climbers have a powerful tail, as e. g. Armadillos,\r\n  while the others that climb well, have none, as Sloths and Apes. But\r\n  when we find a remarkably powerful tail attached to an animal that\r\n  according to all probability was a climber, we are led to infer that\r\n  this organ must have served for that purpose: in other words, that the\r\n  Megalonyx was furnished with a prehensile tail.\r\n\r\n  “How far the Megatherium is to be considered in the same light as the\r\n  Megalonyx cannot be decided without an accurate and scientific\r\n  examination of its skeleton at Madrid. Pander and D’Alton do not\r\n  mention any distortion of the hind-foot, neither does their figure\r\n  exhibit any. It is nevertheless quite possible that such may exist,\r\n  but that it is disguised by the faulty manner in which the skeleton is\r\n  put up. It strikes me as little probable that two animals which agree\r\n  so well in the principal particulars of their organization should\r\n  differ so much in one of the most important. The Megatherium has been\r\n  proved by later discoveries to possess the same powerful tail as the\r\n  Megalonyx, and as it corresponds also with the latter entirely in the\r\n  conformation of its extremities, the same difficulties present\r\n  themselves against the supposition of its having been a burrower. But\r\n  if the Megatherium was really a climber, it must have had still more\r\n  occasion (on account of its greater size), for that peculiar\r\n  arrangement of the hind-feet which we have described in the\r\n  Megalonyx.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Descripcion del Esqueleto de un quadrupedo muy corpulento y raro, que\r\n  se conserva en el Real Gabinete de Historia Natural de Madrid.
