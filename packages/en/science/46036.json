One portion of these\r\nbooks consisted of a collection of ancient mathematical works presented\r\nat various times for the use of that part of the school which is known\r\nas the Royal Mathematical Foundation of King Charles II. Amongst\r\nthem were some well known by name to every mathematical student, but\r\nwhich few have ever seen. Perhaps the most interesting of them all\r\nwas a little volume, printed in London in 1653, containing Gassendi’s\r\n_Explanation of the Ptolemaic and Copernican Systems of Astronomy_, as\r\nwell as that of Tycho Brahe, Galileo’s _Sidereus Nuncius_, and Kepler’s\r\n_Dioptrics_. I found Galileo’s account of his astronomical discoveries\r\nso interesting, both in matter and in style, that I translated it as a\r\nrecreation from school-work. I venture to think that others also will\r\nbe interested in following Galileo through the apprehension of his\r\nfamous discoveries, and in reading the language in which he announced\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1609, Galileo, then Professor of Mathematics at Padua, in the\r\nservice of the Venetian Republic, heard from a correspondent at Paris\r\nof the invention of a telescope, and set to work to consider how\r\nsuch an instrument could be made. The result was his invention of\r\nthe telescope known by his name, and identical in principle with the\r\nmodern opera-glass. In a maritime and warlike State, the advantages\r\nto be expected from such an invention were immediately recognised,\r\nand Galileo was rewarded with a confirmation of his Professorship for\r\nlife, and a handsome stipend, in recognition of his invention and\r\nconstruction of the first telescope seen at Venice. In his pamphlet,\r\n_The Sidereal Messenger_, here translated, Galileo relates how he came\r\nto learn the value of the telescope for astronomical research; and\r\nhow his observations were rewarded by numerous discoveries in rapid\r\nsuccession, and at length by that of Jupiter’s satellites. Galileo at\r\nonce saw the value of this discovery as bearing upon the establishment\r\nof the Copernican system of astronomy, which had met with slight\r\nacceptance, and indeed as yet had hardly any recommendation except\r\nthat of greater simplicity. Kepler had just published at Prague his\r\nwork on the planet Mars (_Commentaria de motibus Stellæ Martis_),\r\non which he had been engaged apparently for eight years; there he\r\nheard of Galileo’s discoveries, and at length was invited by Galileo\r\nhimself, through a common friend, Giuliano de’ Medici, ambassador of\r\nthe Grand-Duke of Tuscany, Cosmo de’ Medici II., to the Emperor Rudolph\r\nII., to correspond with Galileo on the subject of these discoveries.\r\nThe Emperor also requested his opinion, and Kepler accordingly examined\r\nGalileo’s _Sidereal Messenger_ in a pamphlet, entitled _A Discussion\r\nwith the Sidereal Messenger_ (Florence, 1610).\r\n\r\nIn this _Discussion_ Kepler gives reasons for accepting Galileo’s\r\nobservations—although he was not able to verify them from want of\r\na telescope—and entirely supports Galileo’s views and conclusions,\r\nadducing his own previous speculations, or pointing out, as in the case\r\nof Galileo’s idea of earth-light on the moon, the previous conception\r\nof the same explanation of the phenomenon. He rejects, however,\r\nGalileo’s explanation of the copper colour of the moon in eclipses.\r\nKepler ends by expressing unbounded enthusiasm at the discovery of\r\nJupiter’s satellites, and the argument it furnishes in support of the\r\nCopernican theory.\r\n\r\nSoon after, in 1611, Kepler published another pamphlet, his\r\n_Narrative_, giving an account of actual observations made in\r\nverification of Galileo’s discoveries by himself and several friends,\r\nwhose names he gives, with a telescope made by Galileo, and belonging\r\nto Ernest, Elector and Archbishop of Cologne. Kepler and his friends\r\nsaw the lunar mountains and three of the satellites of Jupiter, but\r\nfailed to make out any signs of the ring of Saturn corresponding to the\r\nimperfect description of Galileo.\r\n\r\nKepler had previously published a treatise on Optics (Frankfort, 1604).\r\nHe now extended it to the consideration of the theory of the telescope,\r\nand explained the principle of Galileo’s telescope; he also showed\r\nanother combination of lenses which would produce a similar effect.\r\nThis was the principle of the common astronomical telescope, often\r\ncalled, from this circumstance, Kepler’s telescope, though he did not\r\nconstruct it. The account of Galileo’s later astronomical discoveries\r\nof Saturn’s ring and the phases of Venus is taken from the preface of\r\nthis work.—(Kepler’s _Dioptrics_; Augsburg, 1611.)\r\n\r\nIn 1612 Galileo published a series of observations of solar spots, and\r\nin 1618 some observations of three comets. There exist also long series\r\nof minute observations of Jupiter and his satellites, continued to\r\nNovember 1619.—(Galileo’s _Works_; Florence, 1845.)\r\n\r\nFurther astronomical researches may have been hindered by failing\r\nsight. One more astronomical discovery, however, that of the moon’s\r\nlibrations, was made as late as 1637, and the announcement of it is\r\ndated “dalla mia carcere di Arcetri.” Galileo died January 8, 1642.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following editions have been used for the translation:—\r\n\r\nGalileo’s _Works_.\r\n\r\n    1.

This desire has given us\r\nthe lineaments of famous men, sculptured in marble, or fashioned in\r\nbronze, as a memorial of them to future ages; to the same feeling we\r\nowe the erection of statues, both ordinary and equestrian; hence, as\r\nthe poet[1] says, has originated expenditure, mounting to the stars,\r\nupon columns and pyramids; with this desire, lastly, cities have been\r\nbuilt, and distinguished by the names of those men, whom the gratitude\r\nof posterity thought worthy of being handed down to all ages. For the\r\nstate of the human mind is such, that unless it be continually stirred\r\nby the counterparts[2] of matters, obtruding themselves upon it from\r\nwithout, all recollection of the matters easily passes away from it.\r\n\r\n    [1] Propertius, iii. 2. 17-22.\r\n\r\n    [2] Compare Lucretius iv. 881:\r\n\r\n    Dico animo nostro primum simulacra meandi Accidere, atque animum\r\n    pulsare.\r\n\r\nBut others, having regard for more stable and more lasting monuments,\r\nsecured the eternity of the fame of great men by placing it under the\r\nprotection, not of marble or bronze, but of the Muses’ guardianship\r\nand the imperishable monuments of literature. But why do I mention\r\nthese things, as if human wit, content with these regions, did not\r\ndare to advance further; whereas, since she well understood that all\r\nhuman monuments do perish at last by violence, by weather, or by age,\r\nshe took a wider view, and invented more imperishable signs, over\r\nwhich destroying Time and envious Age could claim no rights; so,\r\nbetaking herself to the sky, she inscribed on the well-known orbs of\r\nthe brightest stars—those everlasting orbs—the names of those who, for\r\neminent and god-like deeds, were accounted worthy to enjoy an eternity\r\nin company with the stars. Wherefore the fame of Jupiter, Mars,\r\nMercury, Hercules, and the rest of the heroes by whose names the stars\r\nare called, will not fade until the extinction of the splendour of the\r\nconstellations themselves.\r\n\r\nBut this invention of human shrewdness, so particularly noble and\r\nadmirable, has gone out of date ages ago, inasmuch as primeval heroes\r\nare in possession of those bright abodes, and keep them by a sort of\r\nright; into whose company the affection of Augustus in vain attempted\r\nto introduce Julius Cæsar; for when he wished that the name of the\r\nJulian constellation should be given to a star, which appeared in\r\nhis time, one of those which the Greeks and the Latins alike name,\r\nfrom their hair-like tails, comets, it vanished in a short time and\r\nmocked his too eager hope. But we are able to read the heavens for\r\nyour highness, most Serene Prince, far more truly and more happily,\r\nfor scarcely have the immortal graces of your mind begun to shine\r\non earth, when bright stars present themselves in the heavens, like\r\ntongues to tell and celebrate your most surpassing virtues to all\r\ntime. Behold therefore, four stars reserved for your famous name, and\r\nthose not belonging to the common and less conspicuous multitude of\r\nfixed stars, but in the bright ranks of the planets—four stars which,\r\nmoving differently from each other, round the planet Jupiter, the\r\nmost glorious of all the planets, as if they were his own children,\r\naccomplish the courses of their orbits with marvellous velocity,\r\nwhile all the while with one accord they complete all together mighty\r\nrevolutions every ten years round the centre of the universe, that is,\r\nround the Sun.\r\n\r\nBut the Maker of the Stars himself seemed to direct me by clear reasons\r\nto assign these new planets to the famous name of your highness in\r\npreference to all others. For just as these stars, like children worthy\r\nof their sire, never leave the side of Jupiter by any appreciable\r\ndistance, so who does not know that clemency, kindness of heart,\r\ngentleness of manners, splendour of royal blood, nobleness in public\r\nfunctions, wide extent of influence and power over others, all of which\r\nhave fixed their common abode and seat in your highness,—who, I say,\r\ndoes not know that all these qualities, according to the providence of\r\nGod, from whom all good things do come, emanate from the benign star\r\nof Jupiter? Jupiter, Jupiter, I maintain, at the instant of the birth\r\nof your highness having at length emerged from the turbid mists of the\r\nhorizon, and being in possession of the middle quarter of the heavens,\r\nand illuminating the eastern angle, from his own royal house, from\r\nthat exalted throne, looked out upon your most happy birth, and poured\r\nforth into a most pure atmosphere all the brightness of his majesty,\r\nin order that your tender body and your mind—though that was already\r\nadorned by God with still more splendid graces—might imbibe with your\r\nfirst breath the whole of that influence and power. But why should I\r\nuse only plausible arguments when I can almost absolutely demonstrate\r\nmy conclusion? It was the will of Almighty God that I should be judged\r\nby your most serene parents not unworthy to be employed in teaching\r\nyour highness mathematics, which duty I discharged, during the four\r\nyears just passed, at that time of the year when it is customary to\r\ntake a relaxation from severer studies. Wherefore, since it evidently\r\nfell to my lot by God’s will, to serve your highness, and so to receive\r\nthe rays of your surpassing clemency and beneficence in a position near\r\nyour person, what wonder is it if you have so warmed my heart that\r\nit thinks about scarcely anything else day and night, but how I, who\r\nam indeed your subject not only by inclination, but also by my very\r\nbirth and lineage, may be known to be most anxious for your glory, and\r\nmost grateful to you? And so, inasmuch as under your patronage, most\r\nserene Cosmo, I have discovered these stars, which were unknown to\r\nall astronomers before me, I have, with very good right, determined\r\nto designate them with the most august name of your family. And as I\r\nwas the first to investigate them, who can rightly blame me if I give\r\nthem a name, and call them _the Medicean Stars_, hoping that as much\r\nconsideration may accrue to these stars from this title, as other stars\r\nhave brought to other heroes? For not to speak of your most serene\r\nancestors, to whose everlasting glory the monuments of all history bear\r\nwitness, your virtue alone, most mighty sire, can confer on those stars\r\nan immortal name; for who can doubt that you will not only maintain and\r\npreserve the expectations, high though they be, about yourself, which\r\nyou have aroused by the very happy beginning of your government, but\r\nthat you will also far surpass them, so that when you have conquered\r\nothers like yourself, you may still vie with yourself, and become day\r\nby day greater than yourself and your greatness?\r\n\r\nAccept, then, most clement Prince, this addition to the glory of your\r\nfamily, reserved by the stars for you; and may you enjoy for many years\r\nthose good blessings, which are sent to you not so much from the stars\r\nas from God, the Maker and Governor of the stars.\r\n\r\n    Your Highness’s most devoted servant,\r\n\r\n    Galileo Galilei.\r\n\r\n    Padua, _March 12, 1610_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASTRONOMICAL MESSENGER\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Containing and setting forth Observations lately made with the aid\r\n    of a newly invented_ Telescope _respecting the Moon’s Surface, the\r\n    Milky Way, Nebulous Stars, an innumerable multitude of Fixed Stars,\r\n    and also respecting Four Planets never before seen, which have been\r\n    named_\r\n\r\n    THE COSMIAN STARS.[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] The satellites of Jupiter are here called “_the Cosmian Stars_”\r\n    in honour of Cosmo de’ Medici, but elsewhere Galileo calls them\r\n    “_the Medicean Stars_.” Kepler sometimes calls them “_the Medicean\r\n    Stars_,” but more often “_satellites_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introduction.]\r\n\r\nIN the present small treatise I set forth some matters of great\r\ninterest for all observers of natural phenomena to look at and\r\nconsider. They are of great interest, I think, first, from their\r\nintrinsic excellence; secondly, from their absolute novelty; and\r\nlastly, also on account of the instrument by the aid of which they have\r\nbeen presented to my apprehension.\r\n\r\nThe number of the Fixed Stars which observers have been able to see\r\nwithout artificial powers of sight up to this day can be counted. It is\r\ntherefore decidedly a great feat to add to their number, and to set\r\ndistinctly before the eyes other stars in myriads, which have never\r\nbeen seen before, and which surpass the old, previously known, stars in\r\nnumber more than ten times.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a most beautiful and delightful sight to behold the body\r\nof the Moon, which is distant from us nearly sixty _semi_-diameters[4]\r\nof the Earth, as near as if it was at a distance of only two of the\r\nsame measures; so that the diameter of this same Moon appears about\r\nthirty times larger, its surface about nine hundred times, and its\r\nsolid mass nearly 27,000 times larger than when it is viewed only with\r\nthe naked eye; and consequently any one may know with the certainty\r\nthat is due to the use of our senses, that the Moon certainly does not\r\npossess a smooth and polished surface, but one rough and uneven, and,\r\njust like the face of the Earth itself, is everywhere full of vast\r\nprotuberances, deep chasms, and sinuosities.\r\n\r\n    [4] Galileo says, “per sex denas fere terrestres _diametros_ a\r\n    nobis remotum” by mistake for _semi-diametros_, and the same\r\n    mistake occurs in p. 11.\r\n\r\nThen to have got rid of disputes about the Galaxy or Milky Way, and\r\nto have made its nature clear to the very senses, not to say to the\r\nunderstanding, seems by no means a matter which ought to be considered\r\nof slight importance. In addition to this, to point out, as with one’s\r\nfinger, the nature of those stars which every one of the astronomers\r\nup to this time has called _nebulous_, and to demonstrate that it is\r\nvery different from what has hitherto been believed, will be pleasant,\r\nand very fine. But that which will excite the greatest astonishment by\r\nfar, and which indeed especially moved me to call the attention of all\r\nastronomers and philosophers, is this, namely, that I have discovered\r\nfour planets, neither known nor observed by any one of the astronomers\r\nbefore my time, which have their orbits round a certain bright star,\r\none of those previously known, like Venus and Mercury round the Sun,\r\nand are sometimes in front of it, sometimes behind it, though they\r\nnever depart from it beyond certain limits. All which facts were\r\ndiscovered and observed a few days ago by the help of a telescope[5]\r\ndevised by me, through God’s grace first enlightening my mind.\r\n\r\n    [5] The words used by Galileo for “telescope” are _perspicillum_,\r\n    _specillum instrumentum_, _organum_, and _occhiale_ (Ital.).\r\n    Kepler uses also _oculare tubus_, _arundo dioptrica_. The word\r\n    “_telescopium_” is used by Gassendi, 1647.\r\n\r\nPerchance other discoveries still more excellent will be made from time\r\nto time by me or by other observers, with the assistance of a similar\r\ninstrument, so I will first briefly record its shape and preparation,\r\nas well as the occasion of its being devised, and then I will give an\r\naccount of the observations made by me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galileo’s account of the invention of his telescope.]\r\n\r\nAbout ten months ago a report reached my ears that a Dutchman had\r\nconstructed a telescope, by the aid of which visible objects, although\r\nat a great distance from the eye of the observer, were seen distinctly\r\nas if near; and some proofs of its most wonderful performances were\r\nreported, which some gave credence to, but others contradicted. A few\r\ndays after, I received confirmation of the report in a letter written\r\nfrom Paris by a noble Frenchman, Jaques Badovere, which finally\r\ndetermined me to give myself up first to inquire into the principle of\r\nthe telescope, and then to consider the means by which I might compass\r\nthe invention of a similar instrument, which a little while after I\r\nsucceeded in doing, through deep study of the theory of Refraction;\r\nand I prepared a tube, at first of lead, in the ends of which I fitted\r\ntwo glass lenses, both plane on one side, but on the other side one\r\nspherically convex, and the other concave. Then bringing my eye to the\r\nconcave lens I saw objects satisfactorily large and near, for they\r\nappeared one-third of the distance off and nine times larger than\r\nwhen they are seen with the natural eye alone. I shortly afterwards\r\nconstructed another telescope with more nicety, which magnified\r\nobjects more than sixty times. At length, by sparing neither labour\r\nnor expense, I succeeded in constructing for myself an instrument\r\nso superior that objects seen through it appear magnified nearly a\r\nthousand times, and more than thirty times nearer than if viewed by the\r\nnatural powers of sight alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galileo’s first observations with his telescope.]\r\n\r\nIt would be altogether a waste of time to enumerate the number and\r\nimportance of the benefits which this instrument may be expected to\r\nconfer, when used by land or sea. But without paying attention to its\r\nuse for terrestrial objects, I betook myself to observations of the\r\nheavenly bodies; and first of all, I viewed the Moon as near as if it\r\nwas scarcely two _semi_-diameters[6] of the Earth distant. After the\r\nMoon, I frequently observed other heavenly bodies, both fixed stars\r\nand planets, with incredible delight; and, when I saw their very great\r\nnumber, I began to consider about a method by which I might be able to\r\nmeasure their distances apart, and at length I found one. And here it\r\nis fitting that all who intend to turn their attention to observations\r\nof this kind should receive certain cautions. For, in the first\r\nplace, it is absolutely necessary for them to prepare a most perfect\r\ntelescope, one which will show very bright objects distinct and free\r\nfrom any mistiness, and will magnify them at least 400 times, for then\r\nit will show them as if only one-twentieth of their distance off. For\r\nunless the instrument be of such power, it will be in vain to attempt\r\nto view all the things which have been seen by me in the heavens, or\r\nwhich will be enumerated hereafter.\r\n\r\n    [6] “Vix per duas Telluris _diametros_,” by mistake for\r\n    “semi-diametros.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Method of determining the magnifying power of the telescope.]\r\n\r\nBut in order that any one may be a little more certain about the\r\nmagnifying power of his instrument, he shall fashion two circles, or\r\ntwo square pieces of paper, one of which is 400 times greater than the\r\nother, but that will be when the diameter of the greater is twenty\r\ntimes the length of the diameter of the other. Then he shall view from\r\na distance simultaneously both surfaces, fixed on the same wall, the\r\nsmaller with one eye applied to the telescope, and the larger with the\r\nother eye unassisted; for that may be done without inconvenience at one\r\nand the same instant with both eyes open. Then both figures will appear\r\nof the same size, if the instrument magnifies objects in the desired\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Method of measuring small angular distances between heavenly\r\nbodies by the size of the aperture of the telescope.]\r\n\r\nAfter such an instrument has been prepared, the method of measuring\r\ndistances remains for inquiry, and this we shall accomplish by the\r\nfollowing contrivance:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor the sake of being more easily understood, I will suppose a tube A\r\nB C D.[7] Let E be the eye of the observer; then, when there are no\r\nlenses in the tube rays from the eye to the object F G would be drawn\r\nin the straight lines E C F, E D G, but when the lenses have been\r\ninserted, let the rays go in the bent lines E C H, E D I,—for they are\r\ncontracted, and those which originally, when unaffected by the lenses,\r\nwere directed to the object F G, will include only the part H I. Hence\r\nthe ratio of the distance E H to the line H I being known, we shall\r\nbe able to find, by means of a table of sines, the magnitude of the\r\nangle subtended at the eye by the object H I, which we shall find to\r\ncontain only some minutes. But if we fit on the lens C D thin plates\r\nof metal, pierced, some with larger, others with smaller apertures, by\r\nputting on over the lens sometimes one plate, sometimes another, as may\r\nbe necessary, we shall construct at our pleasure different subtending\r\nangles of more or fewer minutes, by the help of which we shall be\r\nable to measure conveniently the intervals between stars separated by\r\nan angular distance of some minutes, within an error of one or two\r\nminutes. But let it suffice for the present to have thus slightly\r\ntouched, and as it were just put our lips to these matters, for on\r\nsome other opportunity I will publish the theory of this instrument in\r\ncompleteness.\r\n\r\n    [7] [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    The line C H in Galileo’s figure represents the small pencil of\r\n    rays from H which, after refraction through the telescope, reach\r\n    the eye E. The enlarged figure shows that if O P be the radius of\r\n    the aperture employed, the point H of the object would be just\r\n    outside the field of view. The method, however, is at best only\r\n    a very rough one, as the boundary of the field of view in this\r\n    telescope is unavoidably indistinct.\r\n\r\nNow let me review the observations made by me during the two months\r\njust past, again inviting the attention of all who are eager for true\r\nphilosophy to the beginnings which led to the sight of most important\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon. Ruggedness of its surface. Existence of lunar\r\nmountains and valleys.]\r\n\r\nLet me speak first of the surface of the Moon, which is turned towards\r\nus. For the sake of being understood more easily, I distinguish two\r\nparts in it, which I call respectively the brighter and the darker. The\r\nbrighter part seems to surround and pervade the whole hemisphere; but\r\nthe darker part, like a sort of cloud, discolours the Moon’s surface\r\nand makes it appear covered with spots. Now these spots, as they\r\nare somewhat dark and of considerable size, are plain to every one,\r\nand every age has seen them, wherefore I shall call them _great_ or\r\n_ancient_ spots, to distinguish them from other spots, smaller in size,\r\nbut so thickly scattered that they sprinkle the whole surface of the\r\nMoon, but especially the brighter portion of it. These spots have never\r\nbeen observed by any one before me; and from my observations of them,\r\noften repeated, I have been led to that opinion which I have expressed,\r\nnamely, that I feel sure that the surface of the Moon is not perfectly\r\nsmooth, free from inequalities and exactly spherical, as a large\r\nschool of philosophers considers with regard to the Moon and the other\r\nheavenly bodies, but that, on the contrary, it is full of inequalities,\r\nuneven, full of hollows and protuberances, just like the surface of the\r\nEarth itself, which is varied everywhere by lofty mountains and deep\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nSketches by Galileo to shew:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: the indentation of the terminator and illuminated\r\nsummits of mountains in the dark part of the moon;]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: the shape of a lunar mountain and of a walled plain.\r\nGalileo: ‘Sidereus Nuncius,’ Venice 1610.]\r\n\r\nThe appearances from which we may gather these conclusions are of the\r\nfollowing nature:—On the fourth or fifth day after new-moon, when\r\nthe Moon presents itself to us with bright horns, the boundary which\r\ndivides the part in shadow from the enlightened part does not extend\r\ncontinuously in an ellipse, as would happen in the case of a perfectly\r\nspherical body, but it is marked out by an irregular, uneven, and very\r\nwavy line, as represented in the figure given, for several bright\r\nexcrescences, as they may be called, extend beyond the boundary of\r\nlight and shadow into the dark part, and on the other hand pieces of\r\nshadow encroach upon the light:—nay, even a great quantity of small\r\nblackish spots, altogether separated from the dark part, sprinkle\r\neverywhere almost the whole space which is at the time flooded with the\r\nSun’s light, with the exception of that part alone which is occupied by\r\nthe great and ancient spots. I have noticed that the small spots just\r\nmentioned have this common characteristic always and in every case,\r\nthat they have the dark part towards the Sun’s position, and on the\r\nside away from the Sun they have brighter boundaries, as if they were\r\ncrowned with shining summits. Now we have an appearance quite similar\r\non the Earth about sunrise, when we behold the valleys, not yet flooded\r\nwith light, but the mountains surrounding them on the side opposite to\r\nthe Sun already ablaze with the splendour of his beams; and just as\r\nthe shadows in the hollows of the Earth diminish in size as the Sun\r\nrises higher, so also these spots on the Moon lose their blackness\r\nas the illuminated part grows larger and larger. Again, not only are\r\nthe boundaries of light and shadow in the Moon seen to be uneven\r\nand sinuous, but—and this produces still greater astonishment—there\r\nappear very many bright points within the darkened portion of the\r\nMoon, altogether divided and broken off from the illuminated tract,\r\nand separated from it by no inconsiderable interval, which, after a\r\nlittle while, gradually increase in size and brightness, and after\r\nan hour or two become joined on to the rest of the bright portion,\r\nnow become somewhat larger; but in the meantime others, one here and\r\nanother there, shooting up as if growing, are lighted up within the\r\nshaded portion, increase in size, and at last are linked on to the\r\nsame luminous surface, now still more extended. An example of this\r\nis given in the same figure. Now, is it not the case on the Earth\r\nbefore sunrise, that while the level plain is still in shadow, the\r\npeaks of the most lofty mountains are illuminated by the Sun’s rays?\r\nAfter a little while does not the light spread further, while the\r\nmiddle and larger parts of those mountains are becoming illuminated;\r\nand at length, when the Sun has risen, do not the illuminated parts\r\nof the plains and hills join together? The grandeur, however, of\r\nsuch prominences and depressions in the Moon seems to surpass both\r\nin magnitude and extent the ruggedness of the Earth’s surface, as I\r\nshall hereafter show. And here I cannot refrain from mentioning what a\r\nremarkable spectacle I observed while the Moon was rapidly approaching\r\nher first quarter, a representation of which is given in the same\r\nillustration, placed opposite page 16. A protuberance of the shadow, of\r\ngreat size, indented the illuminated part in the neighbourhood of the\r\nlower cusp; and when I had observed this indentation longer, and had\r\nseen that it was dark throughout, at length, after about two hours, a\r\nbright peak began to arise a little below the middle of the depression;\r\nthis by degrees increased, and presented a triangular shape, but was\r\nas yet quite detached and separated from the illuminated surface. Soon\r\naround it three other small points began to shine, until, when the Moon\r\nwas just about to set, that triangular figure, having now extended and\r\nwidened, began to be connected with the rest of the illuminated part,\r\nand, still girt with the three bright peaks already mentioned, suddenly\r\nburst into the indentation of shadow like a vast promontory of light.\r\n\r\nAt the ends of the upper and lower cusps also certain bright points,\r\nquite away from the rest of the bright part, began to rise out of the\r\nshadow, as is seen depicted in the same illustration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lunar spots are suggested to be possibly seas bordered\r\nby ranges of mountains.]\r\n\r\nIn both horns also, but especially in the lower one, there was a great\r\nquantity of dark spots, of which those which are nearer the boundary\r\nof light and shadow appear larger and darker, but those which are more\r\nremote less dark and more indistinct. In all cases, however, just as I\r\nhave mentioned before, the dark portion of the spot faces the position\r\nof the Sun’s illumination, and a brighter edge surrounds the darkened\r\nspot on the side away from the Sun, and towards the region of the Moon\r\nin shadow. This part of the surface of the Moon, where it is marked\r\nwith spots like a peacock’s tail with its azure eyes, is rendered like\r\nthose glass vases which, through being plunged while still hot from the\r\nkiln into cold water, acquire a crackled and wavy surface, from which\r\ncircumstance they are commonly called _frosted glasses_.[8] Now the\r\ngreat spots of the Moon observed at the same time are not seen to be\r\nat all similarly broken, or full of depressions and prominences, but\r\nrather to be even and uniform; for only here and there some spaces,\r\nrather brighter than the rest, crop up; so that if any one wishes to\r\nrevive the old opinion of the Pythagoreans, that the Moon is another\r\nEarth, so to say, the brighter portion may very fitly represent the\r\nsurface of the land, and the darker the expanse of water. Indeed, I\r\nhave never doubted that if the sphere of the Earth were seen from a\r\ndistance, when flooded with the Sun’s rays, that part of the surface\r\nwhich is land would present itself to view as brighter, and that which\r\nis water as darker in comparison. Moreover, the great spots in the\r\nMoon are seen to be more depressed than the brighter tracts; for in\r\nthe Moon, both when crescent and when waning, on the boundary between\r\nthe light and shadow, which projects in some places round the great\r\nspots, the adjacent regions are always brighter, as I have noticed in\r\ndrawing my illustrations, and the edges of the spots referred to are\r\nnot only more depressed than the brighter parts, but are more even,\r\nand are not broken by ridges or ruggednesses. But the brighter part\r\nstands out most near the spots, so that both before the first quarter\r\nand about the third quarter also, around a certain spot in the upper\r\npart of the figure, that is, occupying the northern region of the Moon,\r\nsome vast prominences on the upper and lower sides of it rise to an\r\nenormous elevation, as the illustrations show. This same spot before\r\nthe third quarter is seen to be walled round with boundaries of a\r\ndeeper shade, which just like very lofty mountain summits appear darker\r\non the side away from the Sun, and brighter on the side where they face\r\nthe Sun; but in the case of the cavities the opposite happens, for the\r\npart of them away from the Sun appears brilliant, and that part which\r\nlies nearer to the Sun dark and in shadow. After a time, when the\r\nenlightened portion of the Moon’s surface has diminished in size, as\r\nsoon as the whole or nearly so of the spot already mentioned is covered\r\nwith shadow, the brighter ridges of the mountains mount high above the\r\nshade. These two appearances are shown in the illustrations which are\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n    [8] Specimens of _frosted or crackled Venetian glass_ are to be\r\n    seen in the Slade Collection, British Museum, and fully justify\r\n    Galileo’s comparison.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Description of a lunar crater, perhaps Tycho.][9]\r\n\r\n    [9] Webb, _Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes_, p. 104,\r\n    suggests this identification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which I must on no account forget, which I\r\nhave noticed and rather wondered at. It is this:—The middle of the\r\nMoon, as it seems, is occupied by a certain cavity larger than all the\r\nrest, and in shape perfectly round. I have looked at this depression\r\nnear both the first and third quarters, and I have represented it as\r\nwell as I can in the second illustration already given. It produces\r\nthe same appearance as to effects of light and shade as a tract like\r\nBohemia would produce on the Earth, if it were shut in on all sides by\r\nvery lofty mountains arranged on the circumference of a perfect circle;\r\nfor the tract in the Moon is walled in with peaks of such enormous\r\nheight that the furthest side adjacent to the dark portion of the\r\nMoon is seen bathed in sunlight before the boundary between light and\r\nshade reaches half-way across the circular space. But according to the\r\ncharacteristic property of the rest of the spots, the shaded portion of\r\nthis too faces the Sun, and the bright part is towards the dark side of\r\nthe Moon, which for the third time I advise to be carefully noticed as\r\na most solid proof of the ruggednesses and unevennesses spread over the\r\nwhole of the bright region of the Moon. Of these spots, moreover, the\r\ndarkest are always those which are near to the boundary-line between\r\nthe light and the shadow, but those further off appear both smaller\r\nin size and less decidedly dark; so that at length, when the Moon at\r\nopposition becomes full, the darkness of the cavities differs from the\r\nbrightness of the prominences with a subdued and very slight difference.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reasons for believing that there is a difference of\r\nconstitution in various parts of the Moon’s surface.]\r\n\r\nThese phenomena which we have reviewed are observed in the bright\r\ntracts of the Moon. In the great spots we do not see such differences\r\nof depressions and prominences as we are compelled to recognise in the\r\nbrighter parts, owing to the change of their shapes under different\r\ndegrees of illumination by the Sun’s rays according to the manifold\r\nvariety of the Sun’s position with regard to the Moon. Still, in the\r\ngreat spots there do exist some spaces rather less dark than the rest,\r\nas I have noted in the illustrations, but these spaces always have the\r\nsame appearance, and the depth of their shadow is neither intensified\r\nnor diminished; they do appear indeed sometimes a little more shaded,\r\nsometimes a little less, but the change of colour is very slight,\r\naccording as the Sun’s rays fall upon them more or less obliquely;\r\nand besides, they are joined to the adjacent parts of the spots with\r\na very gradual connection, so that their boundaries mingle and melt\r\ninto the surrounding region. But it is quite different with the spots\r\nwhich occupy the brighter parts of the Moon’s surface, for, just as\r\nif they were precipitous crags with numerous rugged and jagged peaks,\r\nthey have well-defined boundaries through the sharp contrast of light\r\nand shade. Moreover, inside those great spots certain other tracts are\r\nseen brighter than the surrounding region, and some of them very bright\r\nindeed, but the appearance of these, as well as of the darker parts,\r\nis always the same; there is no change of shape or brightness or depth\r\nof shadow, so that it becomes a matter of certainty and beyond doubt\r\nthat their appearance is owing to real dissimilarity of parts, and\r\nnot to unevennesses only in their configuration, changing in different\r\nways the shadows of the same parts according to the variations of their\r\nillumination by the Sun, which really happens in the case of the other\r\nsmaller spots occupying the brighter portion of the Moon, for day by\r\nday they change, increase, decrease, or disappear, inasmuch as they\r\nderive their origin only from the shadows of prominences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Explanation of the evenness of the illuminated part of\r\nthe circumference of the Moon’s orb by the analogy of terrestrial\r\nphenomena, or by a possible lunar atmosphere.]\r\n\r\nBut here I feel that some people may be troubled with grave doubt, and\r\nperhaps seized with a difficulty so serious as to compel them to feel\r\nuncertain about the conclusion just explained and supported by so many\r\nphenomena. For if that part of the Moon’s surface which reflects the\r\nSun’s rays most brightly is full of sinuosities, protuberances, and\r\ncavities innumerable, why, when the Moon is increasing, does the outer\r\nedge which looks toward the west, when the Moon is waning, the other\r\nhalf-circumference towards the east, and at full-moon the whole circle,\r\nappear not uneven, rugged, and irregular, but perfectly round and\r\ncircular, as sharply defined as if marked out with a pair of compasses,\r\nand without the indentations of any protuberances or cavities? And most\r\nremarkably so, because the whole unbroken edge belongs to that part of\r\nthe Moon’s surface which possesses the property of appearing brighter\r\nthan the rest, which I have said to be throughout full of protuberances\r\nand cavities. For not one of the Great Spots extends quite to the\r\ncircumference, but all of them are seen to be together away from the\r\nedge. Of this phenomenon, which affords a handle for such serious\r\ndoubt, I produce two causes, and so two solutions of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe first solution which I offer is this:—If the protuberances and\r\ncavities in the body of the Moon existed only on the edge of the\r\ncircle that bounds the hemisphere which we see, then the Moon might,\r\nor rather must, show itself to us with the appearance of a toothed\r\nwheel, being bounded with an irregular and uneven circumference; but\r\nif, instead of a single set of prominences arranged along the actual\r\ncircumference only, very many ranges of mountains with their cavities\r\nand ruggednesses are set one behind the other along the extreme edge\r\nof the Moon, and that too not only in the hemisphere which we see, but\r\nalso in that which is turned away from us, but still near the boundary\r\nof the hemisphere, then the eye, viewing them afar off, will not at\r\nall be able to detect the differences of prominences and cavities, for\r\nthe intervals between the mountains situated in the same circle, or in\r\nthe same chain, are hidden by the jutting forward of other prominences\r\nsituated in other ranges, and especially if the eye of the observer\r\nis placed in the same line with the tops of the prominences mentioned.\r\nSo on the Earth, the summits of a number of mountains close together\r\nappear situated in one plane, if the spectator is a long way off and\r\nstanding at the same elevation. So when the sea is rough, the tops of\r\nthe waves seem to form one plane, although between the billows there is\r\nmany a gulf and chasm, so deep that not only the hulls, but even the\r\nbulwarks, masts, and sails of stately ships are hidden amongst them.\r\nTherefore, as within the Moon, as well as round her circumference,\r\nthere is a manifold arrangement of prominences and cavities, and the\r\neye, regarding them from a great distance, is placed in nearly the\r\nsame plane with their summits, no one need think it strange that they\r\npresent themselves to the visual ray which just grazes them as an\r\nunbroken line quite free from unevennesses. To this explanation may be\r\nadded another, namely, that there is round the body of the Moon, just\r\nas round the Earth, an envelope of some substance denser than the rest\r\nof the ether, which is sufficient to receive and reflect the Sun’s\r\nrays, although it does not possess so much opaqueness as to be able to\r\nprevent our seeing through it—especially when it is not illuminated.\r\nThat envelope, when illuminated by the Sun’s rays, renders the body\r\nof the Moon apparently larger than it really is, and would be able\r\nto stop our sight from penetrating to the solid body of the Moon, if\r\nits thickness were greater; now, it is of greater thickness about the\r\ncircumference of the Moon, greater, I mean, not in actual thickness,\r\nbut with reference to our sight-rays, which cut it obliquely; and so it\r\nmay stop our vision, especially when it is in a state of brightness,\r\nand may conceal the true circumference of the Moon on the side towards\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis may be understood more clearly from the adjoining figure, in which\r\nthe body of the Moon, A B C, is surrounded by an enveloping atmosphere,\r\nD E G. An eye at F penetrates to the middle parts of the Moon, as\r\nat A, through a thickness, D A, of the atmosphere; but towards the\r\nextreme parts a mass of atmosphere of greater depth, E B, shuts out its\r\nboundary from our sight. An argument in favour of this is, that the\r\nilluminated portion of the Moon appears of larger circumference than\r\nthe rest of the orb which is in shadow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps also some will think that this same cause affords a very\r\nreasonable explanation why the greater spots on the Moon are not seen\r\nto reach to the edge of the circumference on any side, although it\r\nmight be expected that some would be found about the edge as well as\r\nelsewhere; and it seems credible that there are spots there, but that\r\nthey cannot be seen because they are hidden by a mass of atmosphere too\r\nthick and too bright for the sight to penetrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calculation to show that the height of some lunar mountains\r\nexceeds four Italian miles[10] (22,000 British feet).]\r\n\r\n    [10] In the list of the heights of lunar mountains determined by\r\n    Beer and Maedler, given in their work _Der Mond_ (Berlin, 1837),\r\n    there are six which exceed 3000 toises, or 19,000 British feet.\r\n\r\nI think that it has been sufficiently made clear, from the explanation\r\nof phenomena which have been given, that the brighter part of the\r\nMoon’s surface is dotted everywhere with protuberances and cavities;\r\nit only remains for me to speak about their size, and to show that the\r\nruggednesses of the Earth’s surface are far smaller than those of the\r\nMoon’s; smaller, I mean, absolutely, so to say, and not only smaller\r\nin proportion to the size of the orbs on which they are. And this is\r\nplainly shown thus:—As I often observed in various positions of the\r\nMoon with reference to the Sun, that some summits within the portion\r\nof the Moon in shadow appeared illumined, although at some distance\r\nfrom the boundary of the light (the terminator), by comparing their\r\ndistance with the complete diameter of the Moon, I learnt that it\r\nsometimes exceeded the one-twentieth (1/20th) part of the diameter.\r\nSuppose the distance to be exactly 1/20th part of the diameter, and\r\nlet the diagram represent the Moon’s orb, of which C A F is a great\r\ncircle, E its centre, and C F a diameter, which consequently bears\r\nto the diameter of the Earth the ratio 2:7; and since the diameter\r\nof the Earth, according to the most exact observations, contains\r\n7000 Italian miles, C F will be 2000, and C E 1000, and the 1/20th\r\npart of the whole, C F, 100 miles. Also let C F be a diameter of the\r\ngreat circle which divides the bright part of the Moon from the dark\r\npart (for, owing to the very great distance of the Sun from the Moon\r\nthis circle does not differ sensibly from a great one), and let the\r\ndistance of A from the point C be 1/20th part of that diameter; let\r\nthe radius E A be drawn, and let it be produced to cut the tangent\r\nline G C D, which represents the ray that illumines the summit, in\r\nthe point D. Then the arc C A or the straight line C D will be 100 of\r\nsuch units, as C E contains 1000. The sum of the squares of D C, C E is\r\ntherefore 1,010,000, and the square of D E is equal to this; therefore\r\nthe whole E D will be more than 1004; and A D will be more than 4 of\r\nsuch units, as C E contained 1000. Therefore the height of A D in the\r\nMoon, which represents a summit reaching up to the Sun’s ray, G C D,\r\nand separated from the extremity C by the distance C D, is more than\r\n4 Italian miles; but in the Earth there are no mountains which reach\r\nto the perpendicular height even of one mile. We are therefore left to\r\nconclude that it is clear that the prominences of the Moon are loftier\r\nthan those of the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The faint illumination of the Moon’s disc about new-moon\r\nexplained to be due to earth-light.]\r\n\r\nI wish in this place to assign the cause of another lunar phenomenon\r\nwell worthy of notice, and although this phenomenon was observed by me\r\nnot lately, but many years ago, and has been pointed out to some of my\r\nintimate friends and pupils, explained, and assigned to its true cause,\r\nyet as the observation of it is rendered easier and more vivid by the\r\nhelp of a telescope, I have considered that it would not be unsuitably\r\nintroduced in this place, but I wish to introduce it chiefly in order\r\nthat the connection and resemblance between the Moon and the Earth may\r\nappear more plainly.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon, both before and after conjunction, is found not far\r\nfrom the Sun, not only does its orb show itself to our sight on the\r\nside where it is furnished with shining horns, but a slight and faint\r\ncircumference is also seen to mark out the circle of the dark part,\r\nthat part, namely, which is turned away from the Sun, and to separate\r\nit from the darker background of the sky. But if we examine the matter\r\nmore closely, we shall see that not only is the extreme edge of the\r\npart in shadow shining with a faint brightness, but that the entire\r\nface of the Moon, that side, that is, which does not feel the Sun’s\r\nglare, is illuminated with a pale light of considerable brightness.\r\nAt the first glance only a fine circumference appears shining, on\r\naccount of the darker part of the sky adjacent to it; whereas, on the\r\ncontrary, the rest of the surface appears dark, on account of the\r\ncontiguity of the shining horns, which destroys the clearness of our\r\nsight. But if any one chooses such a position for himself, that by the\r\ninterposition of a roof, or a chimney, or some other object between\r\nhis sight and the Moon, but at a considerable distance from his eye,\r\nthe shining horns are hidden, and the rest of the Moon’s orb is left\r\nexposed to his view, then he will find that this tract of the Moon\r\nalso, although deprived of sunlight, gleams with considerable light,\r\nand particularly so if the gloom of the night has already deepened\r\nthrough the absence of the Sun; for with a darker background the same\r\nlight appears brighter. Moreover, it is found that this secondary\r\nbrightness of the Moon, as I may call it, is greater in proportion as\r\nthe Moon is less distant from the Sun; for it abates more and more in\r\nproportion to the Moon’s distance from that body, so much so that after\r\nthe first quarter, and before the end of the second, it is found to be\r\nweak and very faint, although it be observed in a darker sky; whereas,\r\nat an angular distance of 60° or less, even during twilight, it is\r\nwonderfully bright, so bright indeed that, with the help of a good\r\ntelescope, the great spots may be distinguished in it.\r\n\r\nThis strange brightness has afforded no small perplexity to\r\nphilosophical minds; and some have published one thing, some another,\r\nas the cause to be alleged for it. Some have said that it is the\r\ninherent and natural brightness of the Moon; some that it is imparted\r\nto that body by the planet Venus; or, as others maintain, by all\r\nthe stars; while some have said that it comes from the Sun, whose\r\nrays, they say, find a way through the solid mass of the Moon. But\r\nstatements of this kind are disproved without much difficulty, and\r\nconvincingly demonstrated to be false. For if this kind of light were\r\nthe Moon’s own, or were contributed by the stars, the Moon would retain\r\nit, particularly in eclipses, and would show it then, when left in\r\nan unusually dark sky, but this is contrary to experience. For the\r\nbrightness which is seen on the Moon in eclipses is far less intense,\r\nbeing somewhat reddish, and almost copper-coloured, whereas this is\r\nbrighter and whiter; besides, the brightness seen during an eclipse is\r\nchangeable and shifting, for it wanders over the face of the Moon, so\r\nthat that part which is near the circumference of the circle of shadow\r\nthrown by the Earth is bright, but the rest of the Moon is always seen\r\nto be dark. From which circumstance we understand without hesitation\r\nthat this brightness is due to the proximity of the Sun’s rays coming\r\ninto contact with some denser region which surrounds the Moon as an\r\nenvelope; owing to which contact a sort of dawn-light is diffused over\r\nthe neighbouring regions of the Moon, just as the twilight spreads in\r\nthe morning and evening on the Earth:[11] but I will treat more fully\r\nof this matter in my book upon the _System of the Universe_.[12]\r\n\r\n    [11] The illumination of the Moon in eclipses, noticed by Galileo,\r\n    is now referred to the refraction of the sunlight by the earth’s\r\n    atmosphere, and the reddish colour of the light is explained by\r\n    Herschel (_Outlines of Astronomy_, ch. vii.) to be due to the\r\n    absorption of the violet and blue rays by the aqueous vapour of the\r\n    Earth’s atmosphere. The idea of a sensible lunar atmosphere is not\r\n    in accordance with the observed phenomena of the occultations of\r\n    stars.\r\n\r\n    [12] Galileo’s _Systema Mundi_. Owing to the violent opposition\r\n    provoked by the discussion of the discoveries of Galileo, and\r\n    their bearing on the Copernican system of astronomy, Galileo seems\r\n    to have found it necessary to delay the publication of this work\r\n    until 1632, when, believing himself safe under the friendship and\r\n    patronage of Pope Urban VIII. and others in power at Rome, he\r\n    at length published it. Urban, however, now turned against him,\r\n    denounced the book and its author, and summoned him to Rome, where\r\n    the well-known incidents of his trial and condemnation took place.\r\n\r\nAgain, to assert that this sort of light is imparted to the Moon by the\r\nplanet Venus is so childish as to be undeserving of an answer; for who\r\nis so ignorant as not to understand that at conjunction and within an\r\nangular distance of 60° it is quite impossible for the part of the Moon\r\nturned away from the Sun to be seen by the planet Venus?\r\n\r\nBut that this light is derived from the Sun penetrating with its light\r\nthe solid mass of the Moon, and rendering it luminous, is equally\r\nuntenable. For then this light would never lessen, since the hemisphere\r\nof the Moon is always illumined by the Sun, except at the moment of\r\na lunar eclipse, yet really it quickly decreases while the Moon is\r\ndrawing near to the end of her first quarter, and when she has passed\r\nher first quarter it becomes quite dull. Since, therefore, this\r\nkind of secondary brightness is not inherent and the Moon’s own, nor\r\nborrowed from any of the stars, nor from the Sun, and since there now\r\nremains in the whole universe no other body whatever except the Earth,\r\nwhat, pray, must we conclude? What must we assert? Shall we assert that\r\nthe body of the Moon, or some other dark and sunless orb, receives\r\nlight from the Earth? Why should it not be the Moon? And most certainly\r\nit is. The Earth, with fair and grateful exchange, pays back to the\r\nMoon an illumination like that which it receives from the Moon nearly\r\nthe whole time during the darkest gloom of night. Let me explain the\r\nmatter more clearly. At conjunction, when the Moon occupies a position\r\nbetween the Sun and the Earth, the Moon is illuminated by the Sun’s\r\nrays on her half towards the Sun which is turned away from the Earth,\r\nand the other half, with which she regards the Earth, is covered with\r\ndarkness, and so in no degree illumines the Earth’s surface. When the\r\nMoon has slightly separated from the Sun, straightway she is partly\r\nillumined on the half directed towards us; she turns towards us a\r\nslender silvery crescent, and slightly illumines the Earth; the Sun’s\r\nillumination increases upon the Moon as she approaches her first\r\nquarter, and the reflexion of that light increases on the Earth; the\r\nbrightness in the Moon next extends beyond the semicircle, and our\r\nnights grow brighter; at length the entire face of the Moon looking\r\ntowards the Earth is irradiated with the most intense brightness by\r\nthe Sun, which happens when the Sun and Moon are on opposite sides of\r\nthe Earth; then far and wide the surface of the Earth shines with the\r\nflood of moonlight; after this the Moon, now waning, sends out less\r\npowerful beams, and the Earth is illumined less powerfully; at length\r\nthe Moon draws near her first position of conjunction with the Sun, and\r\nforthwith black night invades the Earth. In such a cycle the moonlight\r\ngives us each month alternations of brighter and fainter illumination.\r\nBut the benefit of her light to the Earth is balanced and repaid by the\r\nbenefit of the light of the Earth to her; for while the Moon is found\r\nnear the Sun about the time of conjunction, she has in front of her\r\nthe entire surface of that hemisphere of the Earth which is exposed to\r\nthe Sun, and vividly illumined with his beams, and so receives light\r\nreflected from the Earth. Owing to such reflexion, the hemisphere\r\nof the Moon nearer to us, though deprived of sunlight, appears of\r\nconsiderable brightness. Again, when removed from the Sun through\r\na quadrant, the Moon sees only one-half of the Earth’s hemisphere\r\nilluminated, namely the western half, for the other, the eastern, is\r\ncovered with the shades of night; the Moon is, therefore, less brightly\r\nenlightened by the Earth, and accordingly that secondary light appears\r\nfainter to us. But if you imagine the Moon to be set on the opposite\r\nside of the Earth to the Sun, she will see the hemisphere of the Earth,\r\nnow between the Moon and the Sun, quite dark, and steeped in the gloom\r\nof night; if, therefore, an eclipse should accompany such a position\r\nof the Moon, she will receive no light at all, being deprived of the\r\nillumination of the Sun and Earth together. In any other position, with\r\nregard to the Earth and the Sun, the Moon receives more or less light\r\nby reflexion from the Earth, according as she sees a greater or smaller\r\nportion of the hemisphere of the Earth illuminated by the Sun; for such\r\na law is observed between these two orbs, that at whatever times the\r\nEarth is most brightly enlightened by the Moon, at those times, on the\r\ncontrary, the Moon is least enlightened by the Earth; and contrariwise.\r\nLet these few words on this subject suffice in this place; for I will\r\nconsider it more fully in my _System of the Universe_, where, by very\r\nmany arguments and experimental proofs, there is shown to be a very\r\nstrong reflexion of the Sun’s light from the Earth, for the benefit of\r\nthose who urge that the Earth must be separated from the starry host,\r\nchiefly for the reason that it has neither motion nor light, for I will\r\nprove that the Earth has motion, and surpasses the Moon in brightness,\r\nand is not the place where the dull refuse of the universe has settled\r\ndown; and I will support my demonstration by a thousand arguments taken\r\nfrom natural phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stars. Their appearance in the telescope.]\r\n\r\nHitherto I have spoken of the observations which I have made concerning\r\nthe Moon’s body; now I will briefly announce the phenomena which have\r\nbeen, as yet, seen by me with reference to the Fixed Stars. And first\r\nof all the following fact is worthy of consideration:—The stars, fixed\r\nas well as erratic, when seen with a telescope, by no means appear to\r\nbe increased in magnitude in the same proportion as other objects,\r\nand the Moon herself, gain increase of size; but in the case of the\r\nstars such increase appears much less, so that you may consider that\r\na telescope, which (for the sake of illustration) is powerful enough\r\nto magnify other objects a hundred times, will scarcely render the\r\nstars magnified four or five times. But the reason of this is as\r\nfollows:—When stars are viewed with our natural eyesight they do not\r\npresent themselves to us of their bare, real size, but beaming with a\r\ncertain vividness, and fringed with sparkling rays, especially when\r\nthe night is far advanced; and from this circumstance they appear much\r\nlarger than they would if they were stripped of those adventitious\r\nfringes, for the angle which they subtend at the eye is determined\r\nnot by the primary disc of the star, but by the brightness which so\r\nwidely surrounds it. Perhaps you will understand this most clearly\r\nfrom the well-known circumstance that when stars rise just at sunset,\r\nin the beginning of twilight, they appear very small, although they\r\nmay be stars of the first magnitude; and even the planet Venus itself,\r\non any occasion when it may present itself to view in broad daylight,\r\nis so small to see that it scarcely seems to equal a star of the last\r\nmagnitude. It is different in the case of other objects, and even of\r\nthe Moon, which, whether viewed in the light of midday or in the depth\r\nof night, always appears of the same size. We conclude therefore that\r\nthe stars are seen at midnight in uncurtailed glory, but their fringes\r\nare of such a nature that the daylight can cut them off, and not only\r\ndaylight, but any slight cloud which may be interposed between a star\r\nand the eye of the observer. A dark veil or coloured glass has the\r\nsame effect, for, upon placing them before the eye between it and\r\nthe stars, all the blaze that surrounds them leaves them at once. A\r\ntelescope also accomplishes the same result, for it removes from the\r\nstars their adventitious and accidental splendours before it enlarges\r\ntheir true discs (if indeed they are of that shape), and so they seem\r\nless magnified than other objects, for a star of the fifth or sixth\r\nmagnitude seen through a telescope is shown as of the first magnitude\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the appearance of the planets and the fixed\r\nstars seems also deserving of notice. The planets present their discs\r\nperfectly round, just as if described with a pair of compasses,\r\nand appear as so many little moons, completely illuminated and of\r\na globular shape; but the fixed stars do not look to the naked eye\r\nbounded by a circular circumference, but rather like blazes of\r\nlight, shooting out beams on all sides and very sparkling, and with\r\na telescope they appear of the same shape as when they are viewed by\r\nsimply looking at them, but so much larger that a star of the fifth or\r\nsixth magnitude seems to equal Sirius, the largest of all the fixed\r\nstars.[13]\r\n\r\n    [13] The immense distance of stars makes it impossible for them to\r\n    be magnified by any telescope, however powerful; the apparent or\r\n    spurious disc is an optical effect, which depends on the telescope\r\n    used, and is smallest with the largest aperture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Orion’s Belt and Sword; 83 Stars_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pleiades; 36 Stars_\r\n\r\n_Galileo: “Sidereus Nuncius.”_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Telescopic Stars: their infinite multitude. As examples,\r\nOrion’s Belt and Sword and the Pleiades are described as seen by\r\nGalileo.]\r\n\r\nBut beyond the stars of the sixth magnitude you will behold through\r\nthe telescope a host of other stars, which escape the unassisted\r\nsight, so numerous as to be almost beyond belief, for you may see more\r\nthan six other differences of magnitude, and the largest of these,\r\nwhich I may call stars of the seventh magnitude, or of the first\r\nmagnitude of invisible stars, appear with the aid of the telescope\r\nlarger and brighter than stars of the second magnitude seen with the\r\nunassisted sight. But in order that you may see one or two proofs of\r\nthe inconceivable manner in which they are crowded together, I have\r\ndetermined to make out a case against two star-clusters, that from them\r\nas a specimen you may decide about the rest.\r\n\r\nAs my first example I had determined to depict the entire constellation\r\nof Orion, but I was overwhelmed by the vast quantity of stars and\r\nby want of time, and so I have deferred attempting this to another\r\noccasion, for there are adjacent to, or scattered among, the old stars\r\nmore than five hundred new stars within the limits of one or two\r\ndegrees. For this reason I have selected the three stars in Orion’s\r\nBelt and the six in his Sword, which have been long well-known groups,\r\nand I have added eighty other stars recently discovered in their\r\nvicinity, and I have preserved as exactly as possible the intervals\r\nbetween them. The well-known or old stars, for the sake of distinction,\r\nI have depicted of larger size, and I have outlined them with a double\r\nline; the others, invisible to the naked eye, I have marked smaller and\r\nwith one line only. I have also preserved the differences of magnitude\r\nas much as I could.\r\n\r\nAs a second example I have depicted the six stars of the constellation\r\nTaurus, called the Pleiades (I say _six_ intentionally, since the\r\nseventh is scarcely ever visible), a group of stars which is enclosed\r\nin the heavens within very narrow precincts. Near these there lie\r\nmore than forty others invisible to the naked eye, no one of which is\r\nmuch more than half a degree off any of the aforesaid six; of these\r\nI have noticed only thirty-six in my diagram. I have preserved their\r\nintervals, magnitudes, and the distinction between the old and the new\r\nstars, just as in the case of the constellation Orion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Milky Way consists entirely of stars in countless\r\nnumbers and of various magnitudes.]\r\n\r\nThe next object which I have observed is the essence or substance of\r\nthe Milky Way. By the aid of a telescope any one may behold this in a\r\nmanner which so distinctly appeals to the senses that all the disputes\r\nwhich have tormented philosophers through so many ages are exploded at\r\nonce by the irrefragable evidence of our eyes, and we are freed from\r\nwordy disputes upon this subject, for the Galaxy is nothing else but a\r\nmass of innumerable stars planted together in clusters. Upon whatever\r\npart of it you direct the telescope straightway a vast crowd of\r\nstars presents itself to view; many of them are tolerably large\r\nand extremely bright, but the number of small ones is quite beyond\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Star-cluster in Orion’s Head_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Star-cluster of Praesepe in Cancer_\r\n\r\n_Galileo: “Sidereus Nuncius,” Venice, 1610._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nebulæ resolved into clusters of stars: as examples, the\r\nnebulæ in Orion’s Head and Præsepe.]\r\n\r\nAnd whereas that milky brightness, like the brightness of a white\r\ncloud, is not only to be seen in the Milky Way, but several spots of\r\na similar colour shine faintly here and there in the heavens, if you\r\nturn the telescope upon any of them you will find a cluster of stars\r\npacked close together. Further—and you will be more surprised at\r\nthis,—the stars which have been called by every one of the astronomers\r\nup to this day _nebulous_, are groups of small stars set thick together\r\nin a wonderful way, and although each one of them on account of its\r\nsmallness, or its immense distance from us, escapes our sight, from\r\nthe commingling of their rays there arises that brightness which has\r\nhitherto been believed to be the denser part of the heavens, able to\r\nreflect the rays of the stars or the Sun.\r\n\r\nI have observed some of these, and I wish to subjoin the star-clusters\r\nof two of these nebulæ. First, you have a diagram of the nebula called\r\nthat of Orion’s Head, in which I have counted twenty-one stars.\r\n\r\nThe second cluster contains the nebula called Præsepe, which is not one\r\nstar only, but a mass of more than forty small stars. I have noticed\r\nthirty-six stars, besides the Aselli, arranged in the order of the\r\naccompanying diagram.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discovery of Jupiter’s satellites, Jan. 7, 1610: record of\r\nGalileo’s observations during two months.]\r\n\r\nI have now finished my brief account of the observations which I have\r\nthus far made with regard to the Moon, the Fixed Stars, and the Galaxy.\r\nThere remains the matter, which seems to me to deserve to be considered\r\nthe most important in this work, namely, that I should disclose and\r\npublish to the world the occasion of discovering and observing four\r\nPLANETS, never seen from the very beginning of the world up to our\r\nown times, their positions, and the observations made during the last\r\ntwo months about their movements and their changes of magnitude; and\r\nI summon all astronomers to apply themselves to examine and determine\r\ntheir periodic times, which it has not been permitted me to achieve up\r\nto this day, owing to the restriction of my time. I give them warning\r\nhowever again, so that they may not approach such an inquiry to no\r\npurpose, that they will want a very accurate telescope, and such as I\r\nhave described in the beginning of this account.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of January in the present year, 1610, in the first[14]\r\nhour of the following night, when I was viewing the constellations of\r\nthe heavens through a telescope, the planet Jupiter presented itself to\r\nmy view, and as I had prepared for myself a very excellent instrument,\r\nI noticed a circumstance which I had never been able to notice before,\r\nowing to want of power in my other telescope, namely, that three little\r\nstars, small but very bright, were near the planet; and although I\r\nbelieved them to belong to the number of the fixed stars, yet they made\r\nme somewhat wonder, because they seemed to be arranged exactly in a\r\nstraight line, parallel to the ecliptic,[15] and to be brighter than\r\nthe rest of the stars, equal to them in magnitude. The position of them\r\nwith reference to one another and to Jupiter was as follows (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n    [14] The times of Galileo’s observations are to be understood as\r\n    reckoned from sunset.\r\n\r\n    [15] The satellites of Jupiter revolve in planes very nearly,\r\n    although not exactly, coincident with that of the equator of the\r\n    planet, which is inclined 3° 5´ 30´´ to the orbit of the planet,\r\n    and the plane of the orbit is inclined 1° 18´ 51´´ to the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nOn the east side there were two stars, and a single one towards the\r\nwest. The star which was furthest towards the east, and the western\r\nstar, appeared rather larger than the third.\r\n\r\nI scarcely troubled at all about the distance between them and Jupiter,\r\nfor, as I have already said, at first I believed them to be fixed\r\nstars; but when on January 8th, led by some fatality, I turned again to\r\nlook at the same part of the heavens, I found a very different state\r\nof things, for there were three little stars all west of Jupiter, and\r\nnearer together than on the previous night, and they were separated\r\nfrom one another by equal intervals, as the accompanying illustration\r\n(Fig. 2) shows.\r\n\r\nAt this point, although I had not turned my thoughts at all upon the\r\napproximation of the stars to one another, yet my surprise began to\r\nbe excited, how Jupiter could one day be found to the east of all the\r\naforesaid fixed stars when the day before it had been west of two of\r\nthem; and forthwith I became afraid lest the planet might have moved\r\ndifferently from the calculation of astronomers, and so had passed\r\nthose stars by its own proper motion. I therefore waited for the next\r\nnight with the most intense longing, but I was disappointed of my hope,\r\nfor the sky was covered with clouds in every direction.\r\n\r\nBut on January 10th the stars appeared in the following position with\r\nregard to Jupiter; there were two only, and both on the east side of\r\nJupiter, the third, as I thought, being hidden by the planet (Fig. 3).\r\nThey were situated just as before, exactly in the same straight line\r\nwith Jupiter, and along the Zodiac.\r\n\r\nWhen I had seen these phenomena, as I knew that corresponding\r\nchanges of position could not by any means belong to Jupiter, and as,\r\nmoreover, I perceived that the stars which I saw had been always the\r\nsame, for there were no others either in front or behind, within a\r\ngreat distance, along the Zodiac,—at length, changing from doubt into\r\nsurprise, I discovered that the interchange of position which I saw\r\nbelonged not to Jupiter, but to the stars to which my attention had\r\nbeen drawn, and I thought therefore that they ought to be observed\r\nhenceforward with more attention and precision.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on January 11th I saw an arrangement of the following\r\nkind (Fig. 4), namely, only two stars to the east of Jupiter, the\r\nnearer of which was distant from Jupiter three times as far as from\r\nthe star further to the east; and the star furthest to the east was\r\nnearly twice as large as the other one; whereas on the previous night\r\nthey had appeared nearly of equal magnitude. I therefore concluded,\r\nand decided unhesitatingly, that there are three stars in the heavens\r\nmoving about Jupiter, as Venus and Mercury round the Sun; which\r\nat length was established as clear as daylight by numerous other\r\nsubsequent observations. These observations also established that there\r\nare not only three, but four, erratic sidereal bodies performing their\r\nrevolutions round Jupiter, observations of whose changes of position\r\nmade with more exactness on succeeding nights the following account\r\nwill supply. I have measured also the intervals between them with the\r\ntelescope in the manner already explained. Besides this, I have given\r\nthe times of observation, especially when several were made in the\r\nsame night, for the revolutions of these planets are so swift that an\r\nobserver may generally get differences of position every hour.\r\n\r\nJan. 12.—At the first hour of the next night I saw these heavenly\r\nbodies arranged in this manner (Fig. 5). The satellite[16] furthest to\r\nthe east was greater than the satellite furthest to the west; but both\r\nwere very conspicuous and bright; the distance of each one from Jupiter\r\nwas two minutes. A third satellite, certainly not in view before, began\r\nto appear at the third hour; it nearly touched Jupiter on the east\r\nside, and was exceedingly small. They were all arranged in the same\r\nstraight line, along the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n    [16] Galileo continues to call these bodies _stars_, perhaps\r\n    meaning “Medicean stars,” throughout the description of their\r\n    configurations, but as he had now detected their nature, it is more\r\n    convenient to call them _satellites_, the term introduced by Kepler.\r\n\r\nJan. 13.—For the first time four satellites were in view in the\r\nfollowing position with regard to Jupiter (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nThere were three to the west, and one to the east; they made a straight\r\nline nearly, but the middle satellite of those to the west deviated a\r\nlittle from the straight line towards the north. The satellite furthest\r\nto the east was at a distance of 2´ from Jupiter; there were intervals\r\nof 1´ only between Jupiter and the nearest satellite, and between the\r\nsatellites themselves, west of Jupiter. All the satellites appeared\r\nof the same size, and though small they were very brilliant, and far\r\noutshone the fixed stars of the same magnitude.\r\n\r\nJan. 14.—The weather was cloudy.\r\n\r\nJan. 15.—At the third hour of the night the four satellites were in the\r\nstate depicted in the next diagram (Fig. 7) with reference to Jupiter.\r\n\r\nAll were to the west, and arranged nearly in the same straight line;\r\nbut the satellite which counted third from Jupiter was raised a little\r\nto the north. The nearest to Jupiter was the smallest of all; the\r\nrest appeared larger and in order of magnitude; the intervals between\r\nJupiter and the three nearest satellites were all equal, and were of\r\nthe magnitude of 2´ each; but the satellite furthest to the west was\r\ndistant 4´ from the satellite nearest to it. They were very brilliant,\r\nand not at all twinkling, as they have always appeared both before\r\nand since. But at the seventh hour there were only three satellites,\r\npresenting with Jupiter an appearance of the following kind (Fig. 8).\r\nThey were, that is to say, in the same straight line to a hair; the\r\nnearest to Jupiter was very small, and distant from the planet 3´; the\r\ndistance of the second from this one was 1´; and of the third from the\r\nsecond 4´ 30´´. But after another hour the two middle satellites were\r\nstill nearer, for they were only 30´´, or less, apart.\r\n\r\nJan. 16.—At the first hour of the night I saw three satellites arranged\r\nin this order (Fig. 9). Jupiter was between two of them, which were at\r\na distance of 0´ 40´´ from the planet on either side, and the third was\r\nwest of Jupiter at a distance of 8´. The satellites near to Jupiter\r\nappeared brighter than the satellite further off, but not larger.\r\n\r\nJan. 17, after sunset 0 hours 30 minutes, the configuration was of\r\nthis kind (Fig. 10). There was one satellite only to the east, at a\r\ndistance of 3´ from Jupiter; to the west likewise there was only one\r\nsatellite, distant 11´ from Jupiter. The satellite on the east appeared\r\ntwice as large as the satellite to the west; and there were no more\r\nthan these two. But four hours after, that is, nearly at the fifth\r\nhour, a third satellite began to emerge on the east side, which, before\r\nits appearance, as I think, had been joined with the former of the two\r\nother satellites, and the position was of this kind (Fig. 11). The\r\nmiddle satellite was very near indeed to the satellite on the east,\r\nand was only 20´´ from it; and was a little towards the south of the\r\nstraight line drawn through the two extreme satellites and Jupiter.\r\n\r\nJan. 18, at 0 h. 20 m. after sunset, the appearance was such as this\r\n(Fig. 12). The satellite to the east was larger than the western one,\r\nand was at a distance from Jupiter of 8´, the western one being at a\r\ndistance of 10´.\r\n\r\nJan. 19.—At the second hour of the night the relative position of\r\nthe satellites was such as this (Fig. 13); that is, there were three\r\nsatellites exactly in a straight line with Jupiter, one to the east, at\r\na distance of 6´ from Jupiter; between Jupiter and the first satellite\r\nto the west in order, there was an interval of 5´; this satellite was\r\n4´ off the other one more to the west. At that time I was doubtful\r\nwhether or no there was a satellite between the satellite to the east\r\nand Jupiter, but so very close to Jupiter as almost to touch the\r\nplanet; but at the fifth hour I saw this satellite distinctly, by\r\nthat time occupying exactly the middle position between Jupiter and\r\nthe eastern satellite, so that the configuration was thus (Fig. 14).\r\nMoreover, the satellite which had just come into view was very small;\r\nyet at the sixth hour it was nearly as large as the rest.\r\n\r\nJan. 20: 1 h. 15 m.—A similar arrangement was seen (Fig. 15). There\r\nwere three satellites, so small as scarcely to be distinguishable;\r\ntheir distances from Jupiter, and from one another, were not more\r\nthan 1´. I was doubtful whether on the western side there were two\r\nsatellites or three. About the sixth hour they were grouped in this way\r\n(Fig. 16). The eastern satellite was twice as far away from Jupiter as\r\nbefore, that is 2´; on the western side, the satellite in the middle\r\nwas distant from Jupiter 0´ 40´´, and from the satellite still further\r\nto the west 0´ 20´´; at length, at the seventh hour, three satellites\r\nwere seen on the western side (Fig. 17). The satellite nearest to\r\nJupiter was distant from the planet 0´ 20´´; between this one and the\r\nsatellite furthest to the west there was an interval of 40´´, but\r\nbetween these another satellite was in view slightly southward of them,\r\nand not more than 10´´ off the most westerly satellite.\r\n\r\nJan. 21: 0 h. 30 m.—There were three satellites on the east side; the\r\nsatellites and Jupiter were at equal distances apart (Fig. 18). The\r\nintervals were by estimation 50´´ each. There was also one satellite\r\non the west, distant 4´ from Jupiter. The satellite on the east side\r\nnearest to Jupiter was the least of all.\r\n\r\nJan. 22: 2 h.—The grouping of the satellites was similar (Fig. 19).\r\nThere was an interval of 5´ from the satellite on the east to Jupiter;\r\nfrom Jupiter to the satellite furthest to the west 7´. The two interior\r\nsatellites on the western side were 0´ 40´´ apart, and the satellite\r\nnearer to Jupiter was 1´ from the planet. The inner satellites were\r\nsmaller than the outer ones, but they were situated all in the same\r\nstraight line, along the ecliptic, except that the middle of the\r\nthree western satellites was slightly to the south of it, but at the\r\nsixth hour of the night they appeared in this position (Fig. 20). The\r\nsatellite on the east was very small, at a distance from Jupiter of 5´\r\nas before; but the three satellites on the west were separated by equal\r\ndistances from Jupiter and from each other; and the intervals were\r\nnearly 1´ 20´´ each. The satellite nearest Jupiter appeared smaller\r\nthan the other two on the same side, but they all appeared arranged\r\nexactly in the same straight line.\r\n\r\nJan. 23, at 0 h. 40 m. after sunset, the grouping of the satellites\r\nwas nearly after this fashion (Fig. 21). There were three satellites\r\nwith Jupiter in a straight line along the ecliptic, as they always\r\nhave been; two were on the east of the planet, one on the west; the\r\nsatellite furthest to the east was 7´ from the next one, and this\r\nsatellite 2´ 40´´ from Jupiter; Jupiter was 3´ 20´´ from the satellite\r\non the west; and they were all of nearly the same size. But at the\r\nfifth hour the two satellites which had been previously near Jupiter\r\nwere no longer visible, being, as I suppose, hidden behind Jupiter, and\r\nthe appearance presented was such as this (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\nJan. 24.—Three satellites, all on the east side, were visible, and\r\nnearly, but not quite, in the same straight line with Jupiter, for the\r\nsatellite in the middle was slightly to the south of it (Fig. 23). The\r\nsatellite nearest to Jupiter was 2´ distant from the planet; the next\r\nin order 0´ 30´´ from this satellite, and the third was 9´ further off\r\nstill; they were all very bright. But at the sixth hour two satellites\r\nonly presented themselves to view in this position, namely in the same\r\nstraight line with Jupiter exactly, and the distance of the nearest\r\nto the planet was lengthened to 3´; the next was 2´ further off, and\r\nunless I am mistaken, the two satellites previously observed in the\r\nmiddle had come together, and appeared as one.\r\n\r\nJan. 25, at 1 h. 40 m., the satellites were grouped thus (Fig. 24).\r\nThere were only two satellites on the east side, and these were rather\r\nlarge. The satellite furthest to the east was 5´ from the satellite in\r\nthe middle, and it was 6´ from Jupiter.\r\n\r\nJan. 26, at 0 h. 40 m., the relative positions of the satellites were\r\nthus (Fig. 25). Three satellites were in view, of which two were\r\neast and the third west of Jupiter; this one was distant 3´ from the\r\nplanet. On the east side the satellite in the middle was at a distance\r\nof 5´ 20´´; the further satellite was 6´ beyond; they were arranged\r\nin a straight line, and were of the same size. At the fifth hour the\r\narrangement was nearly the same, with this difference only, that the\r\nfourth satellite was emerging on the east side near Jupiter. It was\r\nsmaller than the rest, and was then at a distance of 0´ 30´´ from\r\nJupiter; but was raised a little above the straight line towards the\r\nnorth, as the accompanying figure shows (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\nJan. 27, 1 h. after sunset, a single satellite only was in view, and\r\nthat on the east side of Jupiter in this position (Fig. 27). It was\r\nvery small, and at a distance of 7´ from Jupiter.\r\n\r\nJan. 28 and 29.—Owing to the intervention of clouds, I could make no\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nJan. 30.—At the first hour of the night the satellites were in view,\r\narranged in the following way (Fig. 28). There was one satellite on\r\nthe east side, at a distance of 2´ 30´´ from Jupiter; and there were\r\ntwo satellites on the west, of which the one nearer to Jupiter was\r\n3´ off the planet, and the other satellite 1´ further. The places of\r\nthe outer satellites and Jupiter were in the same straight line; but\r\nthe satellite in the middle was a little above it to the north. The\r\nsatellite furthest to the west was smaller than the rest.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the month, at the second hour, two satellites on\r\nthe east side were visible, and one on the west (Fig. 29). Of the\r\nsatellites east of the planet, the one in the middle was 2´ 20´´\r\ndistant from Jupiter; and the satellite further to the east was 0´ 30´´\r\nfrom the middle satellite; the satellite on the west was at a distance\r\nof 10´ from Jupiter. They were in the same straight line nearly, and\r\nwould have been exactly so, only the satellite on the east nearest to\r\nJupiter was raised a little towards the north. At the fourth hour, the\r\ntwo satellites on the east were still nearer together, for they were\r\nonly 20´´ apart (Fig. 30). The western satellite appeared rather small\r\nin these two observations.\r\n\r\nFeb. 1.—At the second hour of the night the arrangement was similar\r\n(Fig. 31). The satellite furthest to the east was at a distance of 6´\r\nfrom Jupiter, and the western satellite 8´. On the east side there was\r\na very small satellite, at a distance of 20´´ from Jupiter. They made a\r\nperfectly straight line.\r\n\r\nFeb. 2.—The satellites were seen arranged thus (Fig. 32). There was one\r\nonly on the east, at a distance of 6´ from Jupiter. Jupiter was 4´\r\nfrom the nearest satellite on the west; between this satellite and the\r\nsatellite further to the west there was an interval of 8´; they were in\r\nthe same straight line exactly, and were nearly of the same magnitude.\r\nBut at the seventh hour four satellites were there—two on each side\r\nof Jupiter (Fig. 33). Of these satellites, the most easterly was at a\r\ndistance of 4´ from the next; this satellite was 1´ 40´´ from Jupiter;\r\nJupiter was 6´ from the nearest satellite on the west, and this one\r\nfrom the satellite further to the west, 8´; and they were all alike in\r\nthe same straight line, drawn in the direction of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\nFeb. 3: 7 h.—The satellites were arranged in the following way (Fig.\r\n34):—The satellite on the east was at a distance of 1´ 30´´ from\r\nJupiter; the nearest satellite on the west, 2´, and there was a\r\nlong distance, 10´, from this satellite to the satellite further to\r\nthe west. They were exactly in the same straight line, and of equal\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nFeb. 4: 2 h.—Four satellites attended Jupiter, two on the east and\r\ntwo on the west, arranged in one perfectly straight line, as in the\r\nadjoining figure (Fig. 35). The satellite furthest to the east was at\r\na distance of 3´ from the next satellite. This one was 0´ 40´´ from\r\nJupiter; Jupiter 4´ from the nearest satellite on the west; and this\r\none from the satellite further to the west 6´. In magnitude they were\r\nnearly equal; the satellite nearest to Jupiter was rather smaller in\r\nappearance than the rest. But at the seventh hour (Fig. 36) the eastern\r\nsatellites were at a distance of only 0´ 30´´ apart. Jupiter was 2´\r\nfrom the nearest satellite on the east; and from the satellite on the\r\nwest, next in order, 4´; this one was distant 3´ from the satellite\r\nfurther to the west. They were all equal in magnitude, and in a\r\nstraight line, drawn in the direction of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nFeb. 5.—The sky was cloudy.\r\n\r\nFeb. 6.—Two satellites only appeared, with Jupiter between them, as is\r\nseen in the accompanying figure (Fig. 37). The satellite on the east\r\nwas 2´ from Jupiter, and that on the west 3´. They were in the same\r\nstraight line with Jupiter, and were equal in magnitude.\r\n\r\nFeb. 7.—There were two satellites by the side of Jupiter, and both of\r\nthem on the east of the planet, arranged in this manner (Fig. 38).\r\nThe intervals between the satellites and Jupiter were equal, and of\r\n1´ each; and a straight line would go through them and the centre of\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nFeb. 8: 1 h.—Three satellites were there, all on the east side of\r\nJupiter, as in the diagram (Fig. 39). The nearest to Jupiter, a\r\nrather small one, was distant from the planet 1´ 20´´; the middle\r\none was 4´ from this satellite, and was rather large; the satellite\r\nfurthest to the east, a very small one, was at a distance of 0´ 20´´\r\nfrom this satellite. It was doubtful whether there was one satellite\r\nnear to Jupiter or two, for sometimes it seemed that there was another\r\nsatellite by its side towards the east, wonderfully small, and only\r\n10´´ from it. They were all situated at points in a straight line drawn\r\nin the direction of the Zodiac. At the third hour the satellite nearest\r\nto Jupiter was almost touching the planet, for it was only distant\r\n10´´ from it; but the others had become further off, for the middle\r\none was 6´ from Jupiter. At length, at the fourth hour, the satellite\r\nwhich was previously the nearest to Jupiter joined with the planet and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nFeb. 9: 0 h. 30 m.—There were two satellites on the east side of\r\nJupiter, and one on the west, in an arrangement such as this (Fig. 40).\r\nThe satellite furthest to the east, which was a rather small one, was\r\ndistant 4´ from the next satellite; the satellite in the middle was\r\nlarger, and at a distance of 7´ from Jupiter. Jupiter was distant 4´\r\nfrom the western satellite, which was a small one.\r\n\r\nFeb. 10: 1 h. 30 m.—A pair of satellites, very small, and both on the\r\neast of the planet, were visible, in the following position (Fig. 41).\r\nThe further satellite was distant from Jupiter 10´, the nearer 0´ 20´´,\r\nand they were in the same straight line; but at the fourth hour the\r\nsatellite nearest to Jupiter no longer appeared, and the other seemed\r\nso diminished that it could scarcely be kept in sight, although the\r\natmosphere was quite clear, and the satellite was further from Jupiter\r\nthan before, since its distance was now 12´.\r\n\r\nFeb. 11: 1 h.—There were two satellites on the east, and one on the\r\nwest (Fig. 42). The western satellite was at a distance of 4´ from\r\nJupiter. The satellite on the east, nearest to the planet, was likewise\r\n4´ from Jupiter; but the satellite further to the east was at a\r\ndistance from this one of 8´; they were fairly clear to view, and in\r\nthe same straight line; but at the third hour the fourth satellite was\r\nvisible near to Jupiter on the east, less in magnitude than the rest,\r\nseparated from Jupiter by a distance of 0´ 30´´, and slightly to the\r\nnorth out of the straight line drawn through the rest (Fig. 43). They\r\nwere all very bright and extremely distinct, but at 5 h. 30 m. the\r\nsatellite on the east nearest to Jupiter had moved further away from\r\nthe planet, and was occupying a position midway between the planet and\r\nthe neighbouring satellite further to the east. They were all in the\r\nsame straight line exactly, and of the same magnitude, as may be seen\r\nin the accompanying diagram (Fig. 44).\r\n\r\nFeb. 12: 0 h. 40 m.—A pair of satellites on the east, a pair likewise\r\non the west, were near the planet (Fig. 45). The satellite on the\r\neast furthest removed from Jupiter was at a distance of 10´, and the\r\nfurther of the satellites on the west was 8´ off. They were both fairly\r\ndistinct. The other two were very near to Jupiter, and very small,\r\nespecially the satellite to the east, which was at a distance of 0´\r\n40´´ from Jupiter. The distance of the western satellite was 1´. But at\r\nthe fourth hour the satellite which was nearest to Jupiter on the east\r\nwas visible no longer.\r\n\r\nFeb. 13: 0 h. 30 m.—Two satellites were visible in the east, two also\r\nin the west (Fig. 46). The satellite on the east near Jupiter was\r\nfairly distinct; its distance from the planet was 2´. The satellite\r\nfurther to the east was less noticeable; it was distant 4´ from the\r\nother. Of the satellites on the west, the one furthest from Jupiter,\r\nwhich was very distinct, was parted from the planet 4´. Between this\r\nsatellite and Jupiter intervened a small satellite close to the most\r\nwesterly satellite, being not more than 0´ 3´´ off. They were all in\r\nthe same straight line, corresponding exactly to the direction of the\r\necliptic.\r\n\r\nFeb. 15 (for on the 14th the sky was covered with clouds), at the\r\nfirst hour, the position of the satellites was thus (Fig. 47); that\r\nis, there were three satellites on the east, but none were visible\r\non the west. The satellite on the east nearest to Jupiter was at a\r\ndistance of 0´ 50´´ from the planet; the next in order was 0´ 20´´\r\nfrom this satellite, and the furthest to the east was 2´ from the\r\nsecond satellite, and it was larger than the others, for those nearer\r\nto Jupiter were very small. But about the fifth hour only one of the\r\nsatellites which had been near to Jupiter was to be seen; its distance\r\nfrom Jupiter was 0´ 30´´. The distance of the satellite furthest to the\r\neast from Jupiter had increased, for it was then 4´ (Fig. 48). But at\r\nthe sixth hour, besides the two situated as just described on the east,\r\none satellite was visible towards the west, very small, at a distance\r\nof 2´ from Jupiter (Fig. 49).\r\n\r\nFeb. 16: 6 h.—Their places were arranged as follows (Fig. 50); that is,\r\nthe satellite on the east was 7´ from Jupiter, Jupiter 5´ from the next\r\nsatellite on the west, and this 3´ from the remaining satellite still\r\nfurther to the west. They were all of the same magnitude nearly, rather\r\nbright, and in the same straight line, corresponding accurately to the\r\ndirection of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\nFeb. 17: 1 h.—Two satellites were in view, one on the east, distant 3´\r\nfrom Jupiter; the other on the west, distant 10´ (Fig. 51). The latter\r\nwas somewhat less than the satellite on the east; but at the sixth\r\nhour the eastern satellite was nearer to Jupiter, being at a distance\r\nof 0´ 50´´, and the western satellite was further off, namely 12´. At\r\nboth observations they were in the same straight line with Jupiter, and\r\nwere both rather small, especially the eastern satellite in the second\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nFeb. 18: 1 h.—Three satellites were in view, of which two were on\r\nthe west and one on the east; the distance of the eastern satellite\r\nfrom Jupiter was 3´, and of the nearest satellite on the west 2´; the\r\nremaining satellite, still further to the west, was 8´ from the middle\r\nsatellite (Fig. 52). They were all in the same straight line exactly,\r\nand of about the same magnitude. But at the second hour the satellites\r\nnearest to the planet were at equal distances from Jupiter, for the\r\nwestern satellite was now also 3´ from the planet. But at the sixth\r\nhour the fourth satellite was visible between the satellite on the east\r\nand Jupiter, in the following configuration (Fig. 53). The satellite\r\nfurthest to the east was at a distance of 3´ from the next in order;\r\nthis one was at a distance of 1´ 50´´ from Jupiter; Jupiter was at a\r\ndistance of 3´ from the next satellite on the west, and this 7´ from\r\nthe satellite still further to the west. These were nearly equal in\r\nmagnitude, only the satellite on the east nearest to Jupiter was a\r\nlittle smaller than the rest, and they were all in the same straight\r\nline parallel to the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nFeb. 19: 0 h. 40 m.—Two satellites only were in view, west of Jupiter,\r\nrather large, and arranged exactly in the same straight line with\r\nJupiter, in the direction of the ecliptic (Fig. 54). The nearer\r\nsatellite was at a distance of 7´ from Jupiter and of 6´ from the\r\nsatellite further to the west.\r\n\r\nFeb. 20.—The sky was cloudy.\r\n\r\nFeb. 21: 1 h. 30 m.—Three satellites, rather small, were in view,\r\nplaced thus (Fig. 55). The satellite to the east was 2´ from Jupiter;\r\nJupiter was 3´ from the next, which was on the west; and this one was\r\n7´ from the satellite further to the west. They were exactly in the\r\nsame straight line parallel to the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nFeb. 25: 1 h. 30 m. (for on the three previous nights the sky was\r\novercast).—Three satellites appeared, two on the east, which were at a\r\ndistance of 4´ apart, the same as the distance of the nearer satellite\r\nfrom Jupiter; on the west there was one satellite at a distance of\r\n2´ from Jupiter. They were exactly in the same straight line in the\r\ndirection of the ecliptic (Fig. 56).\r\n\r\nFeb. 26: 0 h. 30 m.—A pair of satellites only were present, one on\r\nthe east, distant 10´ from Jupiter; the other was on the west, at a\r\ndistance of 6´ (Fig. 57). The eastern satellite was slightly smaller\r\nthan the western. At the fifth hour three satellites were visible; for,\r\nbesides the two already noticed, a third satellite was in view, on the\r\nwest, near Jupiter, very small, which previously had been hidden behind\r\nJupiter, and it was at a distance of 1´ from the planet (Fig. 58).\r\n\r\nBut the satellite on the east was seen to be further off than before,\r\nbeing at a distance of 11´ from Jupiter. On this night, for the first\r\ntime, I determined to observe the motion of Jupiter and the adjacent\r\nplanets (his satellites) along the zodiac, by reference to some fixed\r\nstar; for there was a fixed star in view, eastwards of Jupiter, at a\r\ndistance of 11´ from the satellite on the east, and a little to the\r\nsouth, in the following manner (Fig. 59).\r\n\r\nFeb. 27: 1 h. 4 m.—The satellites appeared in the following\r\nconfiguration. The satellite furthest to the east was at a distance\r\nof 10´ from Jupiter; the next in order was near Jupiter, being at a\r\ndistance of 0´ 30´´ from the planet. The next satellite was on the\r\nwestern side, at a distance of 2´ 30´´ from Jupiter; and the satellite\r\nfurther to the west was at a distance of 1´ from this. The two\r\nsatellites near to Jupiter appeared small, especially the satellite\r\non the east; but the satellites furthest off were very bright,\r\nparticularly that on the west, and they made a straight line in the\r\ndirection of the ecliptic exactly. The motion of the planets towards\r\nthe east was plainly seen by reference to the aforesaid fixed star, for\r\nJupiter and his attendant satellites were nearer to it, as may be seen\r\nin the accompanying figure (Fig. 60). At the fifth hour the satellite\r\non the east, near to Jupiter, was 1´ from the planet.\r\n\r\nFeb. 28: 1 h.—Only two satellites were visible, one on the east, at a\r\ndistance of 9´ from Jupiter, and another on the west, at a distance of\r\n2´; they were both rather bright, and in the same straight line with\r\nJupiter, and a straight line drawn from the fixed star perpendicular\r\nto this straight line fell upon the satellite on the east, as in the\r\nfigure (Fig. 61). At the fifth hour a third satellite was seen at a\r\ndistance of 2´ from Jupiter, on the east, in the position shown in the\r\nfigure (Fig. 62).\r\n\r\nMarch 1: 0 h. 40 m.—Four satellites, all on the east of the planet,\r\nwere seen; the satellite nearest to Jupiter was 2´ from the planet;\r\nthe next 1´ from this; the third was 0´ 20´´ from the second, and was\r\nbrighter than the others; and the satellite still further to the east\r\nwas at a distance of 4´ from it, and was smaller than the others (Fig.\r\n63). They made a straight line very nearly, only the satellite third\r\nfrom Jupiter was slightly above the line. The fixed star formed with\r\nJupiter and the most easterly satellite an equilateral triangle, as in\r\nthe figure.\r\n\r\nMarch 2: 0 h. 40 m.—Three satellites were in attendance, two on the\r\neast and one on the west, in the configuration shown in the diagram\r\n(Fig. 64). The satellite furthest to the east was 7´ from Jupiter; from\r\nthis satellite the next was distant 0´ 30´´, and the satellite on the\r\nwest was separated from Jupiter by an interval of 2´. The satellites\r\nfurthest off were brighter and larger than the remaining satellite,\r\nwhich appeared very small. The satellite furthest to the east seemed to\r\nbe raised a little towards the north, out of the straight line drawn\r\nthrough the other satellites and Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe fixed star already noticed was at a distance of 8´ from the western\r\nsatellite, that is, from the perpendicular drawn from that satellite to\r\nthe straight line drawn through all the system, as shown in the figure\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThese determinations of the motion of Jupiter and the adjacent planets\r\n(his satellites) by reference to a fixed star, I have thought well\r\nto present to the notice of astronomers, in order that any one may\r\nbe able to understand from them that the movements of these planets\r\n(Jupiter’s satellites) both in longitude and in latitude agree exactly\r\nwith the motions [of Jupiter] which are extracted from tables.\r\n\r\nThese are my observations upon the four Medicean planets, recently\r\ndiscovered for the first time by me; and although it is not yet\r\npermitted me to deduce by calculation from these observations the\r\norbits of these bodies, yet I may be allowed to make some statements,\r\nbased upon them, well worthy of attention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deductions from the previous observations concerning the\r\norbits and periods of Jupiter’s satellites.]\r\n\r\nAnd, in the first place, since they are sometimes behind, sometimes\r\nbefore Jupiter, at like distances, and withdraw from this planet\r\ntowards the east and towards the west only within very narrow limits of\r\ndivergence, and since they accompany this planet alike when its motion\r\nis retrograde and direct, it can be a matter of doubt to no one that\r\nthey perform their revolutions about this planet, while at the same\r\ntime they all accomplish together orbits of twelve years’ length about\r\nthe centre of the world. Moreover, they revolve in unequal circles,\r\nwhich is evidently the conclusion to be drawn from the fact that I\r\nhave never been permitted to see two satellites in conjunction when\r\ntheir distance from Jupiter was great, whereas near Jupiter two, three,\r\nand sometimes all (four), have been found closely packed together.\r\nMoreover, it may be detected that the revolutions of the satellites\r\nwhich describe the smallest circles round Jupiter are the most rapid,\r\nfor the satellites nearest to Jupiter are often to be seen in the east,\r\nwhen the day before they have appeared in the west, and contrariwise.\r\nAlso the satellite moving in the greatest orbit seems to me, after\r\ncarefully weighing the occasions of its returning to positions\r\npreviously noticed, to have a periodic time of half a month.[17]\r\nBesides, we have a notable and splendid argument to remove the scruples\r\nof those who can tolerate the revolution of the planets round the Sun\r\nin the Copernican system, yet are so disturbed by the motion of one\r\nMoon about the Earth, while both accomplish an orbit of a year’s length\r\nabout the Sun, that they consider that this theory of the constitution\r\nof the universe must be upset as impossible; for now we have not one\r\nplanet only revolving about another, while both traverse a vast orbit\r\nabout the Sun, but our sense of sight presents to us four satellites\r\ncircling about Jupiter, like the Moon about the Earth, while the whole\r\nsystem travels over a mighty orbit about the Sun in the space of twelve\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n    [17] In the edition of Galileo’s works published at Florence,\r\n    1854, there are given the tables of the hourly movements of the\r\n    satellites of Jupiter, from which Galileo determined their periods\r\n    of revolution. In the beginning of his treatise on floating bodies,\r\n    _Discorso intorno i Galleggianti_, 1611-12, Galileo gives the times\r\n    of rotation as approximately, (i.) 1 d. 18-1/2 h.; (ii.) 3 d.\r\n    13-1/3 h.; (iii.) 7 d. 4 h.; (iv.) 16 d. 18 h.; he also published\r\n    configurations of the satellites calculated for March, April,\r\n    and a part of May 1613. The periodic times of the satellites, as\r\n    corrected by later observers, are, (i.) 1 d. 18 h. 28 m.; (ii.) 3\r\n    d. 13 h. 15 m.; (iii.) 7 d. 3 h. 43 m.; (iv.) 16 d. 16 h. 32 m.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Explanation of the variations in brightness of Jupiter’s\r\nsatellites.]\r\n\r\nLastly, I must not pass over the consideration of the reason why it\r\nhappens that the Medicean stars, in performing very small revolutions\r\nabout Jupiter, seem sometimes more than twice as large as at other\r\ntimes. We can by no means look for the explanation in the mists of the\r\nEarth’s atmosphere, for they appear increased or diminished, while the\r\ndiscs of Jupiter and neighbouring fixed stars are seen quite unaltered.\r\nThat they approach and recede from the Earth at the points of their\r\nrevolutions nearest to and furthest from the Earth to such an extent\r\nas to account for so great changes seems altogether untenable, for a\r\nstrict circular motion can by no means show those phenomena; and an\r\nelliptical motion (which in this case would be nearly rectilinear)\r\nseems to be both untenable and by no means in harmony with the\r\nphenomena observed. But I gladly publish the explanation which has\r\noccurred to me upon this subject, and submit it to the judgment and\r\ncriticism of all true philosophers. It is certain that when atmospheric\r\nmists intervene the Sun and Moon appear larger, but the fixed stars and\r\nplanets less than they really are; hence the former luminaries, when\r\nnear the horizon, are larger than at other times, but stars appear\r\nsmaller, and are frequently scarcely visible; also they are still more\r\ndiminished if those mists are bathed in light; so stars appear very\r\nsmall by day and in the twilight, but the Moon does not appear so,\r\nas I have previously remarked. Moreover, it is certain that not only\r\nthe Earth, but also the Moon, has its own vaporous sphere enveloping\r\nit, for the reasons which I have previously mentioned, and especially\r\nfor those which shall be stated more fully in my _System_; and we may\r\nconsistently decide that the same is true with regard to the rest of\r\nthe planets; so that it seems to be by no means an untenable opinion\r\nto place round Jupiter also an atmosphere denser than the rest of the\r\nether,[18] about which, like the Moon about the sphere of the elements,\r\nthe Medicean planets (Jupiter’s satellites) revolve; and that by the\r\nintervention of this atmosphere they appear smaller when they are in\r\napogee; but when in perigee, through the absence or attenuation of\r\nthat atmosphere, they appear larger. Want of time prevents my going\r\nfurther into these matters; my readers may expect further remarks upon\r\nthese subjects in a short time.\r\n\r\n    [18] Modern astronomers agree in assigning an atmosphere to\r\n    Jupiter, but consider it not extensive enough to affect the\r\n    brightness of the satellites.—(WEBB, _Celestial Objects for Common\r\n    Telescopes_.) Their absolute magnitudes are different, and their\r\n    surfaces have been observed to be obscured by spots, which may\r\n    account for the variations of their brightness. These spots, like\r\n    the lunar spots, are probably due to variations of reflective\r\n    power at different parts of their surfaces, for as they always\r\n    turn the same face to Jupiter, they present different portions of\r\n    their surfaces to us periodically, and it has been ascertained\r\n    by observation that “these fluctuations in their brightness are\r\n    periodical, depending on their position with respect to the\r\n    Sun.”—(HERSCHEL, _Outlines of Astronomy_; ARAGO, _Astronomie\r\n    Populaire_, 1854.)\r\n\r\n_Original Configurations of Jupiter’s Satellites observed by

SIDEREAL MESSENGER._\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the preface to Kepler’s _Dioptrics_ there are introduced letters\r\n    of Galileo about the new and astonishing discoveries which he\r\n    had made in the heavens by the aid of the telescope since the\r\n    publication of his work, _The Sidereal Messenger_. The portion\r\n    of the preface which refers to Galileo, containing these letters\r\n    and Kepler’s remarks upon them, is added here, as continuing the\r\n    original account of Galileo’s astronomical discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Preface of Kepler’s Dioptrics. Augsburg, 1611._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kepler remarks on the importance of the application of the\r\ntelescope to astronomical investigations as indicated by Galileo’s\r\ndiscoveries, published in his _Sidereal Messenger_.]\r\n\r\n“_The Sidereal Messenger_” of Galileo has been for a long time in\r\neverybody’s hands, also my “_Discussion_, such as it is, _with this\r\nMessenger_,” and my _Brief Narrative_ in confirmation of Galileo’s\r\n_Sidereal Messenger_, so any reader may briefly weigh the chief\r\npoints of that _Messenger_ and see the nature and the value of the\r\ndiscoveries made by the aid of the telescope, the theory of which I\r\nam intending to demonstrate in this treatise. Actual sight testified\r\nthat there is a certain bright heavenly body which we call the Moon.\r\nIt was demonstrated from the laws of optics that this body is round;\r\nalso Astronomy, by some arguments founded upon optics, had built\r\nup the conclusion that its distance from the earth is about sixty\r\nsemi-diameters of the earth. Various spots showed themselves in that\r\nbody; and the result was a dubious opinion among a few philosophers,\r\nderived from Hecatæus’ account of the stories about the island of the\r\nHyperboreans,[19] that the reflected images of mountains and valleys,\r\nsea and land, were seen there; but now the telescope places all these\r\nmatters before our eyes in such a way that he must be an intellectual\r\ncoward who, while enjoying such a view, still thinks that the matter\r\nis open to doubt. Nothing is more certain than that the southern\r\nparts of the moon teem with mountains, very many in number, and vast\r\nin size; and that the northern parts, inasmuch as they are lower,\r\nreceive in most extensive lakes the water flowing down from the south.\r\nThe conclusions which previously Pena published as disclosed by the\r\naid of optics, started indeed from certain slight supports, rather\r\nthan foundations, afforded by actual sight, but were proved by long\r\narguments depending one upon another, so that they might be assigned\r\nto human reason rather than to sight; but now our very eyes, as if a\r\nnew door of heaven had been opened, are led to the view of matters once\r\nhidden from them. But if it should please any one to exhaust the force\r\nof reasoning upon these new observations, who does not see how far the\r\ncontemplation of nature will extend her boundaries, when we ask, “What\r\nis the use of the tracts of mountains and valleys, and the very wide\r\nexpanse of seas in the moon?” and “May not some creature less noble\r\nthan man be imagined such as might inhabit those tracts?”\r\n\r\n    [19] Diodorus Siculus, ii. 47.\r\n\r\nWith no less certainty also do we decide by the use of this instrument\r\neven that famous question, which, coeval with philosophy itself, is\r\ndisputed to this day by the noblest intellects—I mean, whether the\r\nearth can move (as the theory of the Planets greatly requires) without\r\nthe overthrow of all bodies that have weight, or the confusion of the\r\nmotion of the elements? For if the earth were banished from the centre\r\nof the universe, some fear lest the water should leave the orb of the\r\nearth and flow to the centre of the universe; and yet we see that in\r\nthe moon, as well as in the earth, there is a quantity of moisture\r\noccupying the sunken hollows of that globe; and although this orb\r\nrevolves actually in the ether, and outside the centres not merely\r\nof the universe, but even of our earth, yet the mass of water in the\r\nmoon is not at all hindered from cleaving invariably to the orb of the\r\nmoon, and tending to the centre of the body to which it belongs. So,\r\nby this instance of the phenomena of the moon, the science of optics\r\namends the received theory of mechanics, and confirms on this point\r\nmy introduction to my _Commentaries upon the Motions of the Planet\r\nMars_.[20]\r\n\r\n    [20] Kepler says in his introduction to his _Commentaries upon\r\n    the Motions of the Planet Mars_, that the theory of gravitation\r\n    depends on certain axioms, one of which is that “heavy bodies do\r\n    not tend to the centre of the universe, supposing the earth to be\r\n    placed there, because that point is the centre of the universe,\r\n    but because it is the centre of the earth. So, wherever the earth\r\n    be set, or whithersoever it be transported, heavy bodies have a\r\n    continual tendency to it.” Kepler’s object in this work was to\r\n    correct the methods for determining the apparent places of the\r\n    planets according to the three theories then current—the Ptolemaic,\r\n    the Copernican, and that of Tycho Brahe.\r\n\r\n    In 1593 the observed place of the planet Mars differed by nearly\r\n    5° from the place calculated for it. Kepler accordingly studied\r\n    the motions of this planet, and “by most laborious demonstrations\r\n    and discussions of many observations,” arrived at the conclusions\r\n    known as Kepler’s first and second laws; according to which the\r\n    Copernican system of eccentrics and epicycles was replaced by an\r\n    ellipse whose centre and eccentricity were the same as the centre\r\n    and eccentricity of the eccentric in the older method, and the Sun\r\n    therefore was in one of the foci. Also the motion of the planet in\r\n    its orbit was such that equal areas were described about the Sun by\r\n    the radius vector of the planet in equal times.—KEPLER, _Astronomia\r\n    Nova_ αἰτιολογητός (Prague), 1609.\r\n\r\nThe followers of the Samian philosophy (for I may use this epithet to\r\ndesignate the philosophy originated by the Samians, Pythagoras and\r\nAristarchus) have a strong argument against the apparent immobility\r\nof the earth provided in the phenomena of the moon. For we are taught\r\nby optics that if any one of us was in the moon, to him the moon, his\r\nabode, would seem quite immovable, but our earth and sun and all the\r\nrest of the heavenly bodies movable; for the conclusions of sight are\r\nthus related.\r\n\r\nPena has noticed how astronomers, using the principles of optics, have\r\nby most laborious reasoning removed the Milky Way from the elementary\r\nuniverse, where Aristotle had placed it, into the highest region of the\r\nether; but now, by the aid of the telescope lately invented, the very\r\neyes of astronomers are conducted straight to a thorough survey of the\r\nsubstance of the Milky Way; and whoever enjoys this sight is compelled\r\nto confess that the Milky Way is nothing else but a mass of extremely\r\nsmall stars.\r\n\r\nAgain, up to this time the nature of nebulous stars had been entirely\r\nunknown; but if the telescope be directed to one of such nebulous\r\nballs, as Ptolemy calls them, it again shows, as in the case of the\r\nMilky Way, three or four very bright stars clustered very close\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAgain, who without this instrument would have believed that the number\r\nof the fixed stars was ten times, or perhaps twenty times, more than\r\nthat which is given in Ptolemy’s description of the fixed stars? And\r\nwhence, pray, should we seek for conclusive evidence about the end or\r\nboundary of this visible universe, proving that it is actually the\r\nsphere of the fixed stars, and that there is nothing beyond, except\r\nfrom this very discovery by the telescope of this multitude of fixed\r\nstars, which is, as it were, the vaulting of the mobile universe?\r\nAgain, how greatly an astronomer would go wrong in determining the\r\nmagnitude of the fixed stars, except he should survey the stars all\r\nover again with a telescope, also may be seen in Galileo’s treatise,\r\nand we will also hereafter produce in proof a letter from a German\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\nBut no words can express my admiration of that chapter of the _Sidereal\r\nMessenger_ where the story is told of the discovery, by the aid of\r\na very highly finished telescope, of another world, as it were, in\r\nthe planet Jupiter. The mind of the philosopher almost reels as he\r\nconsiders that there is a vast orb, which is equal in mass to fourteen\r\norbs like the earth (unless on this point the telescope of Galileo\r\nshall shortly reveal something more exact than the measurements of\r\nTycho Brahe) round which circle four moons, not unlike this moon of\r\nours; the slowest revolving in the space of fourteen of our days, as\r\nGalileo has published; the next to this, by far the brightest of the\r\nfour, in the space of eight days, as I detected in last April and May;\r\nthe other two in still shorter periods. And here the reasoning of my\r\n_Commentaries about the Planet Mars_, applied to a similar case,\r\ninduces me to conclude also that the actual orb of Jupiter rotates with\r\nvery great rapidity, most certainly faster than once in the space of\r\none of our days; so that this rotation of the mighty orb upon its own\r\naxis is accompanied wherever it goes by the perpetual circuits of those\r\nfour moons. Moreover, this sun of ours, the common source of heat and\r\nlight for this terrestrial world as well as for that world of Jupiter,\r\nwhich we consider to be of the angular magnitude of 30´ at most, there\r\nscarcely subtends more than 6´ or 7´, and is found again in the same\r\nposition among the fixed stars, having completed the zodiac in the\r\ninterval, after a period of twelve of our years.[21] Accordingly, the\r\ncreatures which live on that orb of Jupiter, while they contemplate the\r\nvery swift courses of those four moons among the fixed stars, while\r\nthey behold them and the sun rising and setting day by day, would swear\r\nby Jupiter-in-stone, like the Romans (for I have lately returned from\r\nthose parts), that their orb of Jupiter remains immovable in one spot,\r\nand that the fixed stars and the sun, which are the bodies really at\r\nrest, no less than those four moons of theirs, revolve round that abode\r\nof theirs with manifold variety of motions. And from this instance\r\nnow, much more than before from the instance of the moon, any follower\r\nof the Samian philosophy will learn what reply may be made to any one\r\nobjecting to the theory of the motion of the earth as absurd, and\r\nalleging the evidence of our sight. O telescope, instrument of much\r\nknowledge, more precious than any sceptre! Is not he who holds thee in\r\nhis hand made king and lord of the works of God? Truly\r\n\r\n    “All that is overhead, the mighty orbs\r\n    With all their motions, thou dost subjugate\r\n    To man’s intelligence.”\r\n\r\nIf there is any one in some degree friendly to Copernicus and the\r\nlights of the Samian philosophy, who finds this difficulty only, that\r\nhe doubts how it can happen, supposing the earth to perform again and\r\nagain her course among the planets through the ethereal plains, that\r\nthe moon should keep so constantly by her side, like an inseparable\r\ncompanion, and at the same time fly round and round the actual orb\r\nof the earth, just like a faithful dog which goes round and round\r\nhis master on some journey, now running in front, now deviating to\r\nthis side or that, in ever-varying mazes, let him look at the planet\r\nJupiter, which, as this telescope shows, certainly carries in its train\r\nnot one such companion only, like the earth, as Copernicus showed, but\r\nactually four, that never leave it, though all the time hastening each\r\nin its own orbit.\r\n\r\n    [21] The degree of accuracy attained by Kepler and Galileo with\r\n    their imperfect instruments will be appreciated by comparing\r\n    these statements with the determinations of later astronomers.\r\n    Jupiter is about 1300 times the size of the Earth. Its diameter is\r\n    about 87,000 miles; time of rotation, 9 h. 55 m. 21 sec.; time of\r\n    revolution, 4333 days nearly. The angular diameter of the sun, seen\r\n    from Jupiter, is between 6´ and 7´. The times of revolution of the\r\n    four satellites are, as already given: (i.) 1 d. 18 h. 28 m., (ii.)\r\n    3 d. 13 h. 15 m., (iii.) 7 d. 3 h. 43 m., (iv.) 16 d. 16 h. 32 m.\r\n\r\nBut enough has been said about these matters in my _Discussion with the\r\nSidereal Messenger_. It is time that I should turn to those discoveries\r\nwhich have been made since the publication of Galileo’s _Sidereal\r\nMessenger_, and since my _Discussion_ with it, by means of this\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galileo’s discovery of Saturn’s ring (imperfectly).]\r\n\r\nIt is now just a year since Galileo wrote to Prague, and gave full\r\nnotice that he had detected something new in the heavens beyond his\r\nformer discoveries; and that there might not be any one who, with the\r\nintention of detracting from his credit, should try to pass himself\r\noff as an earlier observer of the phenomenon, Galileo gave a certain\r\nspace of time for the publication of the new phenomena which any one\r\nhad seen; he himself meanwhile described his discovery in letters\r\ntransposed in this manner: _s m a i s m r m i l m e p o e t a l e u m i\r\nb u n e n u g t t a u i r a s_. Out of these letters I made an uncouth\r\nverse which I inserted in my _Short Account_ in the month of September\r\nof last year:—\r\n\r\n    Salve umbistineum[22] geminatum Martia proles.\r\n      Hail, twin companionship, children of Mars.\r\n\r\n    [22] _Umbistineum._ Apparently this is some German word with a\r\n    Latin ending, such as _um-bei-stehn_; Kepler fancied that Galileo\r\n    had discovered two satellites of Mars.\r\n\r\nBut I was a very long way from the meaning of the letters; it contained\r\nnothing to do with Mars; and, not to detain you, reader, here is the\r\nsolution of the riddle in the words of Galileo himself, the author of\r\nit:[23]—\r\n\r\n    “_Di Firenze li 13 di Novembre 1610._—Ma passando ad altro, giacchè\r\n    il Sig. Keplero ha in questa sua ultima narrazione stampate le\r\n    lettere che io mandai trasposte a Vostra Signoria Illustrissima\r\n    e Reverendissima venendomi anco significato come Sua Maestà\r\n    ne desidera il senso, ecco che io lo mando a Vostra Signoria\r\n    Illustrissima per participarlo con Sua Maestà col Sig. Keplero e\r\n    con chi piacerà a Vostra Signoria Illustrissima bramando io che\r\n    lo sappia ognuno. Le lettere dunque combinate nel lor vero senso\r\n    dicono così,\r\n\r\n        Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi.\r\n\r\n    Questo è, che Saturno con mia grandissima ammirazione ho osservato\r\n    essere non una stella sola, ma tre insieme, le quali quasi si\r\n    toccano; e sono trà di loro totalmente immobili, e constituite\r\n    in questa guisa o◯o. Quella di mezzo è assai più grande delle\r\n    laterali; sono situate una da oriente, l’altra da occidente, nella\r\n    medesima linea retta a capello; non sono giustamente secondo la\r\n    dirittura del Zodiaco, ma l’occidentale si eleva alquanto verso\r\n    Borea; forse sono parallele all’Equinoziale. Se si guarderanno\r\n    con un occhiale che non sia di grandissima moltiplicazione, non\r\n    appariranno tre stelle ben distinte, ma parrà, che Saturno sia una\r\n    stella lunghetta in forma di un’oliva, così, ☾☽. Ma servendosi\r\n    di un occhiale che moltiplichi più di mille volte in superficie,\r\n    si vedranno tre globi distintissimi, che quasi si toccano, non\r\n    apparendo trà essi maggior divisione di un sottil filo oscuro. Or\r\n    ecco trovata la corte a Giove, e due Servi a questo Vecchio che\r\n    l’aiutano a camminare nè mai se gli staccano dal fianco. Intorno\r\n    agli altri Pianeti non ci è novità alcuna, ec.”\r\n\r\n    [23] The text of the four letters of Galileo followed here is that\r\n    given in the edition of Galileo’s works published at Florence,\r\n    1842-56; that in the edition of Kepler’s _Dioptrics_, published at\r\n    Augsburg, 1611, is very inaccurate. These letters were written to\r\n    Giuliano de’ Medici, ambassador of the Grand-Duke of Tuscany to the\r\n    Emperor Rudolf II. at Prague.\r\n\r\nAlthough these words differ little from Latin, yet I will translate\r\nthem that no difficulty may hinder my reader from following me.\r\nThus then Galileo writes:—“But to come now to my second topic. Since\r\nKepler has published in that recent ‘_Narrative_’ of his the letters\r\nwhich I sent as an anagram to your illustrious Lordship, and since an\r\nintimation has been given me that his Majesty desires to be taught the\r\nmeaning of those letters, I send it to your illustrious Lordship, that\r\nyour Lordship may communicate it to his Majesty, to Kepler, and to any\r\none your Lordship may wish.\r\n\r\n“The letters when joined together as they ought to be, say this,\r\n\r\n   ‘Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi,’\r\n\r\n   ‘I have observed the most distant of the planets to have a triple\r\n    form.’\r\n\r\n    “For in truth I have found out with the most intense surprise\r\n    that the planet Saturn is not merely one single star, but three\r\n    stars very close together, so much so that they are all but in\r\n    contact one with another. They are quite immovable with regard to\r\n    each other, and are arranged in this manner, o◯o. The middle star\r\n    of the three is by far greater than the two on either side. They\r\n    are situated one towards the east, the other towards the west, in\r\n    one straight line to a hair’s-breadth; not, however, exactly in\r\n    the direction of the Zodiac, for the star furthest to the west\r\n    rises somewhat towards the north; perhaps they are parallel to\r\n    the equator. If you look at them through a glass that does not\r\n    multiply much, the stars will not appear clearly separate from one\r\n    another, but Saturn’s orb will appear somewhat elongated, of the\r\n    shape of an olive, thus, ☾☽. But if you should use a glass which\r\n    multiplies a surface more than a thousand times, there will appear\r\n    very distinctly three orbs, almost touching one another; and they\r\n    will be thought to be not farther apart than the breadth of a very\r\n    fine and scarcely visible thread. So you see a guard of satellites\r\n    has been found for Jupiter, and for the decrepit little old man two\r\n    servants to help his steps and never leave his side. Concerning the\r\n    rest of the planets I have found nothing new.”\r\n\r\nSo says Galileo; but if I may do so, I will not make an old dotard out\r\nof Saturn, and two servants for him out of his companion orbs, but\r\nrather out of those three united bodies I will make a triple Geryon,\r\nout of Galileo Hercules, and out of the telescope his club, armed with\r\nwhich, Galileo has conquered that most distant of the planets, drawn it\r\nout of the furthest recesses of nature, dragged it down to earth, and\r\nexposed it to the gaze of us all. It pleases me too, now that the nest\r\nhas been found, to consider with curiosity what kind of brood must\r\nbe in it, what kind of life, if there be any life there, between orbs\r\nwhich all but touch each other two and two, where not even\r\n\r\n                                “a space\r\n    Of sky extends not more than three ells wide,”[24]\r\n\r\nbut where there is scarcely a chink of a nail’s-breadth all round.\r\n\r\n    [24] Virgil, _Eclog._ iii. 105.\r\n\r\nDo indeed the astrologers rightly ascribe to Saturn the guardianship of\r\nminers, who, accustomed to spend their lives, like moles, underground,\r\nseldom breathe the free air under the open sky? Although the darkness\r\nhere is rather more supportable than in Saturn, because the sun, which\r\nappears there only as large as Venus appears to us on the earth,\r\ncontinually casts its rays through the spaces between the different\r\norbs in such a way that those inhabitants who are situated on one orb\r\nare covered by the other as by a ceiling; while those on the latter\r\norb, on the top of this roof of theirs, exposed as it is to the full\r\nlight of the sun, receive a glare as if from very firebrands. But I\r\nmust draw in the reins and check my mind in its enjoyment of the free\r\nfields of ether; for fear, perchance, later observations should report\r\nsomething different from the first account, something changed in\r\ncourse of time.[25]\r\n\r\n    [25] The completion of Galileo’s observations on Saturn depended\r\n    on the improvement of astronomical instruments, as will be evident\r\n    from the following sketch. Galileo made out the first indications\r\n    of Saturn’s ring in 1610, as narrated in his letter, with a power\r\n    of thirty; but in December 1612 he wrote to one of his friends,\r\n    Marco Velseri, that he could no longer see these indications,\r\n    and began to imagine that his telescope had deceived him, and\r\n    apparently abandoned further researches. Hevelius in 1642 saw\r\n    the ring more clearly, but figured it as two crescents attached\r\n    to Saturn by their cusps. At length, in 1653, Huyghens provided\r\n    himself with a power of one hundred, having made the lenses with\r\n    his own hands, and immediately discovered the explanation of the\r\n    phenomena which had baffled previous observers. He published his\r\n    explanation of Saturn’s ring, and his discovery of the first\r\n    satellite, in his _Systema Saturnium_, 1659. Cassini, with still\r\n    more powerful instruments, discovered four more satellites in\r\n    1671, 1672, 1684. Sir William Herschel in 1789 detected two\r\n    more, “which can only be seen with telescopes of extraordinary\r\n    power and perfection, and under the most favourable atmospheric\r\n    circumstances.”—(HERSCHEL, _Outlines of Astronomy_, § 548.) And the\r\n    last of the eight satellites was discovered in 1848 by Lassell of\r\n    Liverpool, and Bond of Cambridge, U.S., simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his letter Galileo seemed to think that he had come to\r\nthe end of his reports about the planets, and observations of new\r\nphenomena respecting them, but ever on the watch, that eye of his,\r\nthat one not of Nature’s making—I mean his telescope—in a short time\r\nmade more discoveries, concerning which read the following letter of\r\nGalileo:—\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Account of Galileo’s discovery of the phases of Venus.]\r\n\r\n    “_Di Firenze li 11 di Decembre 1610._—Sto con desiderio, attendendo\r\n    la risposta a due mie scritte ultimamente per sentire quello, che\r\n    averà detto il Sig. Keplero della stravaganza di Saturno. Intanto\r\n    mando [a Vostra Signoria Illustrissima e Reverendissima] la cifra\r\n    di un altro particolare osservato da me nuovamente, il quale si\r\n    tira dietro la decisione di grandissime controversie in Astronomia,\r\n    ed in particolare contiene in se un gagliardo argomento per la\r\n    constitutione [Pitagorica e Copernicana] dell’Universo; e a suo\r\n    tempo pubblicherò la deciferazione ed altri particolari. Spero che\r\n    averò trovato il metodo per definire i periodi dei quattro Pianeti\r\n    Medicei, stimati con gran ragione quasi inesplicabili dal Sig.\r\n    Keplero, al quale piacerà, ec.\r\n\r\n    “Le lettere trasposte sono queste:\r\n\r\n    “Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur, o.y.”\r\n\r\nWhich may be translated thus:—\r\n\r\n    “I am anxiously looking for an answer to my last two letters, that\r\n    I may learn what Kepler says about the marvels of Saturn’s orb.\r\n    In the meantime I send him a riddle concerning a certain new and\r\n    splendid observation which tends to decide great controversies in\r\n    astronomy; and especially contains a fine argument in favour of the\r\n    Pythagorean and Copernican system of the universe. At the proper\r\n    time I will publish the solution of the riddle, and some other\r\n    particulars. I hope that I have found a method of determining the\r\n    periodic times of the four Medicean planets, which Kepler, not\r\n    without very good reason, thought inexplicable, etc.\r\n\r\n“The letters turned into an anagram, are these:\r\n\r\n    “Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur, o.y.”\r\n\r\nSo far Galileo. But if, reader, this letter has filled you with a\r\ndesire to know the meaning contained in those letters, then you must\r\nread another letter of Galileo which follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n_E the Earth (centre of universe). S the Sun. C centre of eccentric. D\r\ncentre of planet’s epicycle. VV' stationary points. s v v' projections\r\nof SVV' on the ecliptic of which E is the centre._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n_S the Sun, centre of solar system. v e positions of planet and Earth\r\nat conjunction. VV' stationary points of planet. EE' corresponding\r\npositions of the Earth._]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut before you do so, I should like you to notice, by the way, what\r\nGalileo says about the Pythagorean and Copernican system of the\r\nuniverse. For he points to my _Mystery of the Universe_,[26] published\r\nfourteen years ago, in which I took the dimensions of the Planetary\r\norbits according to the astronomy of Copernicus, who makes the sun\r\nimmovable in the centre, and the earth movable both round the sun and\r\nupon its own axis; and I showed that the differences of their orbits\r\ncorresponded to the five regular Pythagorean figures, which had been\r\nalready distributed by their author among the elements of the world,\r\nthough the attempt was admirable rather than happy or legitimate, and\r\nfor which figures’ sake Euclid wrote the whole of his Geometry. Now,\r\nin that _Mystery_ you may find a sort of combination of Astronomy\r\nand Euclid’s Geometry, and through this combination a most thorough\r\ncompletion and finishing of them both; and this was the reason why I\r\nwaited with intense longing to see what sort of an argument Galileo\r\nwould produce in favour of the Pythagorean system of the universe.\r\nAfter this explanation, Galileo’s letter about this argument was as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    [26] Kepler, in his _Mystery of the Universe_, endeavoured to\r\n    connect the orbits of the planets with the five regular solids,\r\n    thus: If in a sphere (i.) a cube be inscribed, and in the cube\r\n    a sphere (ii.); and in that sphere a tetrahedron, and in the\r\n    tetrahedron a sphere (iii.); and in that sphere a dodecahedron,\r\n    and in the dodecahedron a sphere (iv.); and in that sphere an\r\n    icosahedron, and in the icosahedron a sphere (v.); and in that\r\n    sphere an octahedron, and in the octahedron a sphere (vi.),\r\n    the diameters of these six spheres will be proportional to the\r\n    diameters of the orbits of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Earth, Venus,\r\n    and Mercury respectively; or, as Kepler expresses it, the common\r\n    centre of these spheres represents the position of the Sun, and the\r\n    six spheres represent the spheres of the planets.\r\n\r\n    By these considerations, however, Kepler was led to enunciate\r\n    his third law, that the squares of the periodic times of planets\r\n    are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the\r\n    sun.—KEPLER, _Prodromus Dissertationum Mathematicarum continens\r\n    Mysterium Cosmographicum, etc._ (Tübingen, 1596.)\r\n\r\n    “Illustrissimo e Reverendissimo Signore mio colendissimo.\r\n\r\n    “È tempo che io deciferi a Vostra Signoria Illustrissima e\r\n    Reverendissima e per lei al Sig. Keplero le lettere trasposte\r\n    le quali alcune settimane sono le inviai; è tempo dico, giacchè\r\n    sono interamente chiaro della verità del fatto, sicchè non ci\r\n    resta un minimo scrupolo, o dubbio. Sapranno dunque come circa a\r\n    tre mesi fa vedendosi Venere vespertina la cominciai ad osservar\r\n    diligentemente coll’occhiale, per veder col senso stesso\r\n    quello di che non dubitava punto l’intelletto. La vidi dunque sul\r\n    principio di figura rotonda, pulita e terminata, ma molto picciola;\r\n    di tal figura si mantenne sino che cominciò ad avvicinarsi alla\r\n    sua massima digressione, ma tra tanto andò crescendo in mole.\r\n    Cominciò poi a mancare dalla rotondità nella sua parte orientale\r\n    ed avversa al Sole, e in pochi giorni si ridusse ad esser un mezzo\r\n    cerchio perfettissimo, e tale si mantenne, senza punto alterarsi,\r\n    finchè incominciò à ritirarsi verso il Sole, allontanandosi\r\n    dalla tangente. Ora va calando dal mezzo cerchio, e si mostra\r\n    cornicolata, e anderà assottigliandosi sino all’occultazione,\r\n    riducendosi allora con corna sottilissime. Quindi passando all’\r\n    apparizione mattutina, la vedremo pur falcata, e sottilissima e\r\n    colle corna avverse al Sole; anderà poi crescendo fino alla massima\r\n    digressione, dove apparirà semicircolare, e tale senza alterarsi si\r\n    manterrà molti giorni, e poi dal mezzo cerchio passerà presto al\r\n    tutto tondo, e così rotonda si conserverà poi per molti mesi. Il\r\n    suo diametro adesso è circa cinque volte maggiore di quello, che\r\n    si mostrava nella sua prima apparizione vespertina; dalla quale\r\n    mirabile esperienza abbiamo sensata, e certa dimostrazione di due\r\n    gran questioni state fin qui dubbie trà i maggiori ingegni del\r\n    Mondo. L’una è, che i Pianeti tutti son di lor natura tenebrosi\r\n    (accadendo anco a Mercurio l’istesso, che a Venere). L’altra, che\r\n    Venere necessarissimamente si volge intorno al Sole, come anco\r\n    Mercurio, cosa, che degli altri Pianeti, fu creduta da’ Pitagorici,\r\n    dal Copernico, dal Keplero e da’ loro seguaci, ma non sensatamente\r\n    provata, come ora in Venere, ed in Mercurio.\r\n\r\n    “Averanno dunque il Sig. Keplero, e gli altri Copernicani da\r\n    gloriarsi di aver creduto e filosofato bene, sebbene ci è toccato,\r\n    e ci è per toccare ancora ad esser reputati dall’ università dei\r\n    Filosofi in libris, per poco intendenti, e poco meno che stolti.\r\n\r\n    “Le parole dunque, che mandai trasposte, e che dicevano,\r\n\r\n        Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur, o.y.\r\n\r\n    dicono ordinate\r\n\r\n        Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum.\r\n\r\n    “Cioè, che Venere imita le figure della Luna. Osservai tre notti\r\n    sono l’ecclisse, nella quale non vi è cosa notabile, solo si vede\r\n    il taglio dell’ombra indistinto, confuso e come annebbiato,\r\n    e questo per derivare essa ombra dalla Terra lontanissima da\r\n    essa Luna. Voleva scrivere altri particolari, ma essendo stato\r\n    trattenuto molto da alcuni gentiluomini, ed essendo l’ora\r\n    tardissima, son forzato a finire.

Di Firenze il primo di Gennaio 1610. Ab Incarnatione.\r\n\r\n    “Di Vostra Signoria Illustrissima e Reverendissima Servidore\r\n    obbligatissimo.\r\n\r\n    Galileo Galilei.”\r\n\r\nSuch is Galileo’s letter; but let me give you the substance of it:—\r\n\r\n    “It is time for me to disclose the method of reading the letters\r\n    which some weeks since I sent you as an anagram. It is time now, I\r\n    mean, after I have become quite certain about the matter, so much\r\n    so that I have no longer even a shadow of doubt. You must know then\r\n    that about three months ago, when the star of Venus could be seen,\r\n    I began to look at it through a telescope with great attention,\r\n    so that I might grasp with my physical senses an idea which I was\r\n    entertaining as certain. At first then you must know the planet\r\n    Venus appeared of a perfectly circular form, accurately so, and\r\n    bounded by a distinct edge, but very small; this figure Venus kept\r\n    until it began to approach its greatest distance from the sun,\r\n    and meanwhile the apparent size of its orb kept on increasing.\r\n    From that time it began to lose its roundness on the eastern side,\r\n    which was turned away from the sun, and in a few days it contracted\r\n    its visible portion into an exact semicircle; that figure lasted\r\n    without the smallest alteration until it began to return towards\r\n    the sun where it leaves the tangent drawn to its epicycle.[27]\r\n    At this time it loses the semicircular form more and more, and\r\n    keeps on diminishing that figure until its conjunction, when it\r\n    will wane to a very thin crescent. After completing its passage\r\n    past the sun, it will appear to us, at its appearance as a morning\r\n    star, as only sickle-shaped, turning a very thin crescent away from\r\n    the sun; afterwards the crescent will fill up more and more until\r\n    the planet reaches its greatest distance from the sun, in which\r\n    position it will appear semicircular, and that figure will last\r\n    for many days without appreciable variation. Then by degrees, from\r\n    being semicircular it will change to a full orb, and will keep that\r\n    perfectly circular figure for several months; but at this instant\r\n    the diameter of the orb of Venus is about five times as large as\r\n    that which it showed at its first appearance as an evening star.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “From the observation of these wonderful phenomena we are supplied\r\n    with a determination most conclusive, and appealing to the evidence\r\n    of our senses, of two very important problems, which up to this\r\n    day were discussed by the greatest intellects with different\r\n    conclusions. One is that the planets are bodies not self-luminous\r\n    (if we may entertain the same views about Mercury as we do about\r\n    Venus). The second is that we are absolutely compelled to say\r\n    that Venus (and Mercury also) revolves round the sun, as do also\r\n    all the rest of the planets. A truth believed indeed by the\r\n    Pythagorean school, by Copernicus, and by Kepler, but never proved\r\n    by the evidence of our senses, as it is now proved in the case of\r\n    Venus and Mercury. Kepler therefore and the rest of the school\r\n    of Copernicus have good reason for boasting that they have shown\r\n    themselves good philosophers, and that their belief was not devoid\r\n    of foundation; however much it has been their lot, and may even\r\n    hereafter be their lot, to be regarded by the philosophers of our\r\n    times, who philosophise on paper, with an universal agreement, as\r\n    men of no intellect, and little better than absolute fools.\r\n\r\n    “The words which I sent with their letters transposed, and which\r\n    said,\r\n\r\n      Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur, o.y.\r\n\r\n    when reduced to their proper order, read thus,\r\n\r\n      Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum:\r\n      The mother of the Loves rivals the phases of Cynthia:\r\n\r\n    that is,\r\n\r\n      Venus imitates the phases of the Moon.\r\n\r\n    “Three days ago I observed an eclipse of the moon, but not anything\r\n    worthy of special notice occurred in it. Only the edge of the\r\n    shadow appeared indistinct, blurred, and hazy; the cause of the\r\n    phenomenon no doubt is that the shadow has its origin at the earth,\r\n    at a great distance from the body of the moon.\r\n\r\n    “I have some other particulars, but I am prevented by time from\r\n    writing about them, etc.”\r\n\r\nSo writes Galileo.\r\n\r\n    [27] In the Ptolemaic system the earth’s centre was regarded as the\r\n    centre of the universe, and the movements of the heavenly bodies\r\n    were explained by eccentrics and epicycles. The sun was conceived\r\n    to describe a circle about a point not exactly coinciding with the\r\n    centre of the earth, called the sun’s _eccentric_. The planets\r\n    described epicycles (circles) whose centres described eccentrics\r\n    (circles), and the centres of these eccentrics coincided with the\r\n    centre of the sun’s eccentric. In the case of Mercury and Venus\r\n    the centre of the epicycle was always on the line drawn from the\r\n    centre of the eccentric to the sun’s centre. In the case of the\r\n    other planets the construction was more complicated. The stationary\r\n    points were determined by drawing tangents from the earth’s centre\r\n    (or the observer) to the epicycle, as in the figure (1).—(GASSENDI,\r\n    _Institutio Astronomica_, 1647.) This will explain Kepler’s\r\n    description of the stationary points as the points where the\r\n    planet leaves the tangent to its epicycle, supposing that he uses\r\n    the terms of the current (_i.e._ Ptolemaic) astronomy. Copernicus\r\n    placed the sun instead of the earth at the centre of the universe,\r\n    but to determine the positions of the planets at any given time\r\n    with as much accuracy as was attainable with the Ptolemaic system,\r\n    he was obliged to use a similar method of eccentrics and epicycles,\r\n    so that Kepler’s expression may be understood to describe the\r\n    stationary points according to the Copernican theory, though it\r\n    is still strange that he should not recognise the elliptical form\r\n    of the planetary orbits, which he had lately demonstrated after\r\n    most laborious reasoning in his _Commentaries on the Motion of the\r\n    Planet Mars_, 1609. Galileo’s own expression seems to describe the\r\n    stationary points according to the Copernican system, as would be\r\n    expected, as the points where the planet leaves the tangent drawn\r\n    to its _orbit_ from the earth (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nWhat now, dear reader, shall we make out of our telescope? Shall we\r\nmake a Mercury’s magic-wand to cross the liquid ether with, and, like\r\nLucian,[28] lead a colony to the uninhabited evening star, allured by\r\nthe sweetness of the place? or shall we make it a Cupid’s arrow, which,\r\nentering by our eyes, has pierced our inmost mind, and fired us with\r\na love of Venus? For what language is too strong for the marvellous\r\nbeauty of this orb, if, having no light of its own, it can attain\r\nsimply by the borrowed light of the sun to such splendour, as Jupiter\r\nhas not, nor the moon, though enjoying a proximity to the sun as close\r\nas Venus; for if the moon’s light be compared with the light of Venus,\r\nit will be seen to be certainly greater on account of the apparent\r\nmagnitude of the moon, but, in comparison with the light of Venus,\r\ndull, dead, and leaden. O truly golden Venus! Will any one doubt any\r\nmore that the whole orb of Venus is wrought most smoothly out of pure\r\nunalloyed gold, since its surface, when only placed in the sunlight,\r\nreflects a splendour so intense! And here let me add my experiments\r\nabout the alteration of the light of Venus on blinking the eye, which\r\nI have examined in the part of my Astronomy which treats of Optics.\r\nReasoning will be able to conclude nothing else but this, that the orb\r\nof Venus turns on its own axis with an exceedingly swift rotation,\r\ndisplaying one after another different parts of its surface which are\r\nmore or less capable of retaining the sun’s light.[29]\r\n\r\n    [28] Lucian, _Ver. Hist._ i. 12.\r\n\r\n    [29] The first scientific determination of the period of the\r\n    rotation of Venus was made by Dominique Cassini in 1666, from\r\n    observations of spots on the planet, and concluded to be about 24\r\n    hours; but in 1726 Bianchini deduced a period of 24 d. 8 h. from\r\n    similar observations. The true period is considered to be 23 h. 21\r\n    m., determined by Schroeter by a series of observations lasting\r\n    from 1788 to 1793 on the periodicity of the deformation of the\r\n    horns of Venus.—(ARAGO, _Astronomie Populaire_, 1854.)\r\n\r\n    Kepler’s statements can only be regarded as anticipations of\r\n    phenomena not yet actually observed.\r\n\r\nBut enough of my own conclusions. Let us now hear as an epilogue\r\nGalileo’s conclusions built up out of all the observations which he\r\nhas made with his telescope, and announced from time to time. Thus he\r\nwrites once more:—\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galileo’s conclusions with regard to the inherent nature of\r\nthe brightness of the stars.]\r\n\r\n    “Illustrissimo e Reverendissimo Signore mio colendissimo.\r\n\r\n    “Ho ricevuto gusto, e contento particolarissimo nella lettura\r\n    dell’ ultima di Vostra Signoria Illustrissima e Reverendissima\r\n    delli 7 stante, ed in particolare in quella parte dove ella\r\n    m’accenna la favorevole inclinazione dell’ Illustriss. Sig.\r\n    Cons. Wackher, verso di me, la quale io infinitamente stimo,\r\n    ed apprezzo; e poichè quella ha principalmente origine dall’\r\n    aver io incontrate osservazioni necessariamente dimostranti\r\n    conclusioni per avanti tenute vere da sua Signoria Illustrissima\r\n    per confermarmi maggiormente il possesso di grazia tanto pregiata\r\n    da me, prego Vostra Signoria Illustrissima e Reverendissima a\r\n    fargli intendere per mia parte come conforme alla credenza di\r\n    Sua Signoria Illustrissima ho dimostrazione certa, che siccome\r\n    tutti i Pianeti ricevono il lume dal Sole, essendo per se stessi\r\n    tenebrosi, e opachi; così le Stelle fisse risplendono per lor\r\n    natura, non bisognose dell’ illustrazione de’ raggi solari, li\r\n    quali, Dio sa, se arrivino a tanta altezza, più di quello, che\r\n    arrivi a noi il lume di una di esse fisse. Il principal fondamento\r\n    del mio discorso è nell’ osservare io molto evidentemente con\r\n    gli occhiali che quei Pianeti di mano in mano, che si trovano\r\n    più vicini a noi, o al Sole, ricevono maggiore splendore, e più\r\n    illustremente ce lo riverberano; e perciò Marte perigeo, e a noi\r\n    vicinissimo si vede assai più splendido, che Giove; benchè a\r\n    quello di mole assai inferiore; e difficilmente se gli può coll’\r\n    occhiale levare quella irradiazione, che impedisce il vedere il suo\r\n    disco terminato, e rotondo; il che in Giove non accade, vedendosi\r\n    esquisitamente circolare. Saturno poi per la sua gran lontananza\r\n    si vede esattamente terminato, sì la Stella maggiore di mezzo,\r\n    come le due piccole laterali; ed appare il suo lume languido, ed\r\n    abbacinato e senza niuna irradiazione, che impedisca il distinguere\r\n    i suoi tre piccoli globi terminatissimi. Ora poichè apertamente\r\n    veggiamo, che il Sole molto splendidamente illustra Marte vicino,\r\n    e che molto più languido è il lume di Giove (sebbene senza lo\r\n    strumento appare assai chiaro, il che accade per la grandezza, e\r\n    candore della Stella) languidissimo, e fosco quello di Saturno,\r\n    come molto più lontano, quali doveriano apparirci le Stelle\r\n    fisse lontane indicibilmente più di Saturno, quando il lume loro\r\n    derivasse dal Sole? Certamente debolissime, torbide e smorte. Ma\r\n    tutto l’opposito si vede, perocchè se rimireremo per esempio il\r\n    Cane, incontreremo un fulgore vivissimo, che quasi ci toglie la\r\n    vista, con una vibrazione di raggi tanto fiera, e possente, che\r\n    in comparazione di quello rimangono i Pianeti, e dico Giove e\r\n    Venere stessa, come un impurissimo vetro appresso un limpidissimo\r\n    e finissimo diamante. E benchè il disco di esso Cane apparisca non\r\n    maggiore della cinquantesima parte di quello di Giove, tuttavia la\r\n    sua irradiazione è grande, e fiera in modo, che l’istesso globo\r\n    tra i proprii crini s’implica, e quasi si perde, e con qualche\r\n    difficoltà si distingue; dove che Giove (e molto più Saturno)\r\n    si vedono e terminati, e di una luce languida, e per così dire\r\n    quieta. E per tanto io stimo, che bene filosoferemo, referendo la\r\n    causa della scintillazione delle Stelle fisse, al vibrare, che elle\r\n    fanno dello splendore proprio e nativo dall’intima loro sustanza;\r\n    dove che nella superficie de’ Pianeti termina più presto, e si\r\n    finisce l’illuminazione, che dal Sole deriva, e si parte. Se io\r\n    sentirò qualche particolare questione ricevuta dal medesimo Sig.\r\n    Wackher, non resterò d’affaticarmivi intorno, per dimostrarmi,\r\n    quale io sono desiderosissimo di servire un tanto Signore, e non\r\n    già con isperanza di aggiungere al termine conseguito dal suo\r\n    discorso, perchè benissimo comprendo, che a quanto sia passato\r\n    per lo finissimo cribro del giudizio di esso, e del Sig. Keplero,\r\n    non si può aggiungere di squisitezza; nè io pretenderei altro,\r\n    che col dubitare, e mal filosofare, eccitar loro al ritrovamento\r\n    di nuove sottigliezze. Gl’ingegni singolari, che in gran numero\r\n    fioriscono nell’Alemagna, mi hanno lungo tempo tenuto in desiderio\r\n    di vederla, il qual desiderio ora si raddoppia per la nuova grazia\r\n    dell’Illustrissimo Sig. Wackher, la quale mi farebbe divenir\r\n    grande ogni picciola occasione, che mi si presentasse. Ma ho di\r\n    soverchio occupata Vostra Signoria Illustrissima e Reverendissima.\r\n    Degnisi per fine di offerirmi e dedicarmi devotissimo servidore\r\n    all’Illustrissimo Sig. Wackher, salutando anco caramente il Sig.\r\n    Keplero, ed a lei con ogni riverenza bacio le mani, e dal Signore\r\n    Dio le prego somma felicità.\r\n\r\n    “[Di Firenze li 26] di Marzo 1611. Di Vostra Signoria Illustrissima\r\n    e Reverendissima obbligatissimo Servidore,\r\n\r\n    GALILEO GALILEI.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen translated, the meaning is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Your last letter has exceedingly pleased me, especially that part\r\n    which assures me of the friendly feeling entertained towards me by\r\n    the most illustrious Imperial Counsellor, Wagher, which I for my\r\n    part highly appreciate. And since the cause of this friendliness\r\n    is, that I have incontestably demonstrated by some observations of\r\n    mine certain conclusions which he had long held as true, I wish\r\n    to confirm my possession of favour, which I value so much, and\r\n    accordingly I ask you to give him this piece of news from me; that\r\n    I have most conclusive arguments ready, showing clearly that, just\r\n    as he holds, all the planets receive their light from the sun,\r\n    being by constitution bodies dark and devoid of light;[30] but that\r\n    the fixed stars shine by their own proper light, not needing to be\r\n    illuminated by the sun’s rays, since God knows whether they reach\r\n    the very remote region of the fixed stars with intensity even equal\r\n    to the small intensity with which the rays of the fixed stars come\r\n    down to us.\r\n\r\n    “My demonstration depends chiefly on this fact, that with the\r\n    telescope I have distinctly observed that the planets receive\r\n    greater brightness, and reflect it more intensely, in proportion\r\n    as each one is nearer to us and to the sun. So Mars in perigee,\r\n    that is, when nearest to the earth, greatly surpasses Jupiter in\r\n    brightness, although in actual size it is far inferior to Jupiter;\r\n    and in consequence it is difficult to receive the effulgence of\r\n    this planet in the telescope, for it is so great as to prevent the\r\n    eye from being able to distinguish the circular termination of the\r\n    planet’s disc. This does not happen in the case of Jupiter, for it\r\n    appears quite circular. The next planet, Saturn, on account of its\r\n    great distance likewise—for indeed it is the most remote of the\r\n    planets,—appears bounded by a well-defined edge, both the greater\r\n    orb in the middle and the two small orbs at its sides. Indeed,\r\n    it appears to shine with a faint and delicate light, without any\r\n    effulgence to prevent an observer recognising the well-defined\r\n    termination of its three orbs. Since, then, we see that Mars, the\r\n    nearest of the three, is illumined by the sun with very great\r\n    splendour, and that the light of Jupiter, at a greater distance,\r\n    is much more faint (although without the use of an instrument it\r\n    appears tolerably bright, which is due to the size and brilliancy\r\n    of its body), and that the light of Saturn, at the greatest\r\n    distance, is most faint, and almost watery, of what kind, do you\r\n    think, would appear the light of the fixed stars, which are at an\r\n    immeasurable distance further from the sun than Saturn, if they\r\n    only received light from the sun? Most certainly, extremely feeble,\r\n    indistinct, and pallid. And yet we find quite the contrary; for,\r\n    let us look with our eyes at the Dog-Star, for example. We shall\r\n    encounter a most vivid brilliancy, which almost pricks the eye\r\n    with the rapid sparkling of its rays, of such intensity that, in\r\n    comparison with it, the planets, even Jupiter, and Venus too, are\r\n    as thoroughly outshone as common and bad glass compared with a\r\n    highly polished and most sparkling diamond. And although the orb of\r\n    the Dog-Star appears no larger than the fiftieth part of Jupiter’s\r\n    disc, nevertheless its brilliancy is great and very strong; so that\r\n    the form of its disc, which you expect to see, hides itself among\r\n    the rays of its own refulgence, envelops itself in them, and almost\r\n    disappears; and it is not distinguished without some difficulty\r\n    from the rays which surround it. Whereas Jupiter, and still\r\n    more Saturn, are seen well defined; and their light is without\r\n    intensity, and, if I may say so, quiescent. Wherefore I think that\r\n    we shall rightly apply our philosophy if we refer the cause of the\r\n    twinkling of the fixed stars to vibrations of a brilliancy, which\r\n    is their own, belonging to their constitution, and inherent in\r\n    their substance, and say, on the other hand, that the illumination\r\n    of the planets, which is derived from the sun, and distributed to\r\n    the world, is limited to their surface.”\r\n\r\nThese are the scientific conclusions in Galileo’s letter; the rest I\r\nomit.\r\n\r\n    [30] Proctor (_Other Worlds than Ours_, 1875) has given some\r\n    reasons for believing that Jupiter and Saturn shine in part with\r\n    their own light, owing to their great internal heat.\r\n\r\nYou see then, studious reader, how the subtle mind of Galileo, in my\r\nopinion the first philosopher of the day, uses this telescope of ours\r\nlike a sort of ladder, scales the furthest and loftiest walls of the\r\nvisible world, surveys all things with his own eyes, and, from the\r\nposition he has gained, darts the glances of his most acute intellect\r\nupon these petty abodes of ours—the planetary spheres I mean,—and\r\ncompares with keenest reasoning the distant with the near, the lofty\r\nwith the deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VALE ET DEUM IN OPERIBUS SUIS CELEBRARE NUNQUAM DESINE.\r\n\r\n    KEPLER, _Narratio_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdinburgh University Press:\r\n\r\nTHOMAS AND ARCHIBALD CONSTABLE, PRINTERS TO HER MAJESTY.",
