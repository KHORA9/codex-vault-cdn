Similarly can\r\nit now be prophesied that throughout the world electrical traction will\r\nultimately supplant all other forms. An age of electricity is dawning,\r\nwhen “power” may be obtained direct from fuel or from the vast store of\r\nenergy existing in the heated interior of the earth, or even from the\r\natmosphere that surrounds us; when every mountain stream and gleaming\r\nwaterfall throughout Great Britain, and each tide as it rises and falls,\r\nwill help to generate the subtle fluid, which, produced on a vast scale\r\nabroad, where giant cataracts and mighty rapids abound, may be imported\r\nto supplement our home supply, and be utilised in every manufacturing\r\ndistrict; when all our main lines will be electric, and “light railways”\r\nubiquitous; when coal-less ships and aerial machines, with perfected\r\naccumulators, may possibly traverse sea and ocean, and invade the domain\r\nof condor and eagle; when farms will be cultivated by electrical\r\ncontrivances, and their produce expeditiously conveyed to market, and\r\nthe sanitation of our streets be ensured by the universal use of\r\nhorseless vehicles. An age that may witness “current” laid on for\r\ndomestic purposes to every house in the land as a matter of course; and\r\nalso as machine-power to village settlements, where artisans engaged in\r\ncertain kinds of trade may work amidst the pleasant surroundings of\r\nhome. And thus the abstract principle, “Back to the land,” may become an\r\naccomplished fact.\r\n\r\nTo bring the body of this work precisely up to the date of its\r\npublication being obviously impossible, I take the opportunity of making\r\npassing reference to the railway disaster on the Métropolitain of Paris,\r\nwhen eighty-four passengers were killed, and which has caused the public\r\nmind to be much disturbed by the possibility of danger in the London\r\nTubes.\r\n\r\nAs regards trams, the London United Tramways Company established a\r\nrecord of traffic during the August Bank Holiday period, the total for\r\nthe four days being 878,000, that on Monday alone being 330,000\r\ntravellers. A serious electric tram accident occurred at Ramsgate in\r\nAugust, when nineteen persons were injured by the colliding of one car\r\nwith another at a point where the lines converged.\r\n\r\nThen, as to motor-cars. The great Gordon-Bennett race in Ireland this\r\nsummer was won by a German. A tentative Act of Parliament for regulating\r\nthe traffic, to come into force January 1st next, and to continue for\r\nthree years, has received the Royal Assent, the speed limit being fixed\r\nat twenty miles per hour.\r\n\r\nA service of motor hansom cabs is shortly to be established in London.\r\nThe Fischer “combination” omnibus has successfully passed through\r\nrepeated private trials, and will probably be adopted by one or both of\r\nthe metropolitan chief companies.\r\n\r\nMotor bath-chairs, to hold two people, and propelled by electricity,\r\nwill be accomplished facts at the World’s Fair, St. Louis, next year.\r\n\r\nI have now to acknowledge, with thanks, the assistance of Sir William H.\r\nPreece, who kindly read through the proof-sheets of this volume just\r\nbefore he fell seriously ill in August, and of his son, Mr. Llewellyn\r\nPreece, who has written the Introduction, and I now leave “Tube, Train,\r\nTram, and Car” to receive the verdict of those who travel.\r\n\r\nARTHUR H. BEAVAN\r\n\r\n_September, 1903._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nBY LLEWELLYN PREECE, M.I.E.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to give the public a general idea as to the\r\nprogress now being made in the application of electricity for transport\r\npurposes, and it was intended that Sir William Preece should write the\r\nintroduction and correct the author so far as any technical\r\nmisstatements were concerned. Unhappily, Sir William Preece has fallen\r\nvictim to a very severe illness, which entirely incapacitates him from\r\nany work, and will prevent him from doing anything for some months to\r\ncome. Just before his illness, however, he had gone through the proofs\r\nand made certain corrections, all of which, the author tells me, have\r\nbeen accepted, but owing to the great delay in the publication of this\r\nbook which has already been incurred, and to the impossibility of\r\ndiscussing these matters with my father, I have not been able to check\r\nthe proofs since the alterations were made.\r\n\r\nThe advances which, within the last few years, have been made in the\r\napplication of electricity for the purpose of transportation are shown\r\nvery clearly in this book, and if the author has made one or two flights\r\non the wings of fancy regarding the future which may be somewhat\r\nstartling to the reader, it must be remembered that if many things which\r\nare of everyday occurrence had been suggested to any of us fifty years\r\nago, and if we had been told that it would be possible to travel at the\r\nrate of a hundred miles an hour, we should have been somewhat inclined\r\nto laugh. As the reader will learn, such travelling is to be very\r\nshortly a fact.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I do not believe that it will be so much with the\r\nhigh-speed work as with the tramway and light railway work that\r\nelectricity will be of the greatest service to the public in the future.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the time when there will be a network of light\r\nrailways surrounding every town in the kingdom, enabling the population\r\nto spread itself out once again in the country.\r\n\r\nCentral power stations distributing electric current over a radius of\r\nfifteen or twenty miles will enable these railways to work at very low\r\ncost, and therefore carry passengers considerable distances at low\r\nfares.\r\n\r\nThe tendency at the present time being to reduce the hours of labour,\r\nwhether mental or manual, the time at the disposal of a workman for\r\ntravelling will increase, so that with an eight hours working day and\r\ncheap electric light railways, there will be no reason why the poorest\r\nlabourer should not live in the country, and at least sleep in a pure\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe adaptability of electricity to motor-car work has hardly yet been\r\nsufficiently realised. People see the luxurious electric brougham,\r\ndescribed in this book, running on the streets of London and other large\r\ncities, but few have any idea that not only the wealthy aristocrat, but\r\neveryone will, before long, be able to ride in such carriages, possibly\r\nnot so luxuriousy fitted up, but equally comfortable and speedy.\r\n\r\nThe usual cry at present is that electric cars are very nice, but the\r\nowners have great difficulties with the batteries. Undoubtedly batteries\r\nhave given trouble in the past, and still do so to some extent. But if a\r\nman buys a horse and gives it in charge of the gardener’s boy, he is\r\nlikely to have trouble with his horse. In the same way, if a man buys an\r\nelectric carriage and expects his coachman to look after it, he only\r\nnaturally does have considerable trouble. There are several companies\r\nprepared to look after and maintain in continuous use, not only the\r\nbatteries, but the complete carriages, and this is greatly improving the\r\nreliability of the electric car, and allaying the fears of those anxious\r\nto have such carriages.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the battery itself is making great strides forward: its\r\ncapacity per cwt. has largely increased, its life is much longer, and\r\nits reliability under great variations of discharge has considerably\r\nimproved. In fact, it may be safely said that even now the electric car\r\nis more reliable than either the petrol or the steam car. At present it\r\nwill not do the same distance on one charge, nor will it do the great\r\nspeed other cars will, but this is the great reason why it should appeal\r\nto the British public. The craze for high speeds does not affect the\r\nmajority of people. I believe that it is only a question of a few years\r\nfor the petrol and steam cars to be placed in museums and shown as\r\nmonstrosities of the past, like the mammoth elephant, and that every\r\ncab, omnibus, and private carriage throughout the country will use\r\nelectricity as the motive power.\r\n\r\nIn fact I do not think it unwarrantable to assert that, so far as this\r\ncountry is concerned, many of us will see the day when the only form of\r\nenergy used for transportation will be that known as electricity.\r\n\r\nLLEWELLYN PREECE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n               PAGE\r\n\r\nTHE OLD AND THE NEW ORDER OF RAILWAY LOCOMOTION                        1\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSOME PIONEER ELECTRIC RAILWAYS                                        11\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSOME PIONEER ELECTRIC RAILWAYS (_continued_)                          19\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE ELECTRIC RAILWAYS                                          31\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nREJUVENATING THE METROPOLITAN INNER CIRCLE                            47\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL LONDON ELECTRIC RAILWAY                                   63\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE TUBULAR SYSTEM                                                    74\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTOURING IN THE TUBES                                                  90\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLONDON’S TANGLED TUBES                                               107\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nLONDON’S LATEST AND LONGEST TUBE                                     117\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nELECTRIC TRAMWAYS GENERALLY                                          128\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLONDON’S TRAMWAYS                                                    141\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL TRAMWAYS                                                  162\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE SHALLOW UNDERGROUND SYSTEM                                       186\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nHORSELESS VEHICLES--ELECTRICAL AND OTHERWISE                         200\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nHORSELESS VEHICLES--ELECTRICAL AND OTHERWISE (_continued_)           214\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nHORSELESS VEHICLES--ELECTRICAL AND OTHERWISE (_continued_)           224\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY APPLIED TO NAVIGATION (A FORECAST)                       230\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSOME ELECTRIC LOCOMOTION DRAWBACKS                                   250\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSOME ELECTRIC LOCOMOTION DRAWBACKS (_continued_)                     258\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LOCOMOTION AND OUR NATIONAL LIFE                            269\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG.

So effective was the competition of the\r\n“iron horse,” that in lieu of the fifty-four splendidly equipped\r\nvehicles which in 1835 carried His Majesty’s mails throughout England,\r\nnot a single coach left the General Post Office, St. Martin’s-le-Grand,\r\nin the year 1844; while the kings highways had become almost deserted.\r\n\r\nThough this was barely sixty years ago, railways have evolved themselves\r\nout of their embryonic state into a condition approaching the fateful\r\none of perfect development.\r\n\r\nIn early days, first-class passengers were boxed up in replicas of old\r\nstage-coaches, the second-class in open carriages exposed to the\r\nweather, and the third-class huddled together in seatless cattle-trucks.\r\nContrast this with our luxurious Pullmans, and our corridor and\r\nvestibule trains for all classes, warmed throughout, lighted by\r\nelectricity, and provided with lavatories, dining-saloons, buffets, and\r\nsleeping-cars. “With what further improvements can we allure the\r\npublic?” ask anxious directors. One answer only is possible. “By\r\nbringing the mode of locomotion up to date.”\r\n\r\nThis means, in the case of old-established railway companies, a complete\r\nand costly transformation, or an independent mono-rail track for long\r\ndistances; under any circumstances entailing much hardship upon the\r\nshareholders. For at the moment when railway-engineers--improving so\r\nvastly upon George Stephenson’s venerable engine,[1] built in 1822, and\r\nstill at work for the Hutton Colliery, its weight only fifteen tons, its\r\nspeed ten miles an hour--have constructed such magnificent locomotives\r\nas the “Greater Britain” for the London and North\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. QUEEN VICTORIA’S TRAIN ON THE GREAT WESTERN\r\nRAILWAY]\r\n\r\nWestern Railway, or the ten-wheeled giant[2] for the Great Northern\r\nRailway, fifty-seven feet over all, weighing 100 tons, and capable of\r\nreeling off its 65 miles an hour with ease, electricity steps into the\r\nfield, displaces the stately engine--resplendent in red, blue, green, or\r\nchocolate paint, glossy as the coat of some highly trained racehorse,\r\nand gleaming with polished brass and steel, finished in all its parts\r\nwith exquisite accuracy, the very embodiment of energy under perfect\r\ncontrol--and from some unpretentious-looking building afar off, drives\r\nour trains with unseen but resistless force, at the rate, if desired, of\r\na hundred miles an hour!\r\n\r\nThe construction of an ordinary steam locomotive is an intricate\r\noperation, necessitating machine-shops, erecting-shops, foundries,\r\nforges, etc., covering acres of ground, as at Crewe, Doncaster, Derby,\r\nor Swindon. Not a hundred engines are exactly alike in pattern, and each\r\none is supposed to be composed of over five thousand different parts,\r\nall of which have to be stowed away in a necessarily limited space.\r\n\r\n“How is steam utilised by the locomotive?” is a question asked again and\r\nagain (and not by children only) ever since Stephenson’s engine started\r\non its triumphant progress from Stockton to Darlington and back, and\r\nwhich, I venture to affirm, only a small percentage of travellers, even\r\nin 1903, can answer “right away,” as our American cousins would express\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBriefly, then, as follows: Raised up on high is the mighty boiler.\r\nRemove its plates, and running through its entire length will be seen a\r\ncluster of some two or three hundred brass tubes, in diameter that of a\r\npenny-piece. At the rear of the boiler, on a lower level, is the fuel\r\nfire-box, with its grate and ash-pan, while in front is the smoke-box,\r\nsurmounted by the familiar chimney or funnel, called in the United\r\nStates the “smoke-stack,” in British engines reduced to a minimum of\r\nheight. Water from the tender surrounds the brass tubes, and when the\r\nfire is burning, flames, smoke, and heated gases rush through them,\r\nescaping _viâ_ the chimney, but in their passage converting the boiling\r\nwater into expanding steam, which, when the regulator is opened, is\r\ndirected by valves into the hollow cylinders--sometimes placed below the\r\nboiler, but generally visible outside--forcing by its pressure the\r\npistons backwards and forwards alternately, and, by means of\r\nintermediate machinery, transferring its energy to the driving-wheels.\r\n\r\nThe exhausted steam, after accomplishing its work, joins the smoke in\r\nthe smoke-box, escaping up the funnel by jerks, which creates a forced\r\ndraught through the brass boiler-tubes, and hastens the generation of\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY--THE NEW ORDER\r\n\r\nContrast this with electricity, the definition of whose exact nature is\r\na task I must of necessity leave to others, but its adaptation to the\r\npurposes of traction can be thus broadly explained:--\r\n\r\nDynamos or generators are situated at some fixed station, more or less\r\ndistant, generating electrical energy, whence the current is transmitted\r\nalong a central steel rail, or, in the case of some tramways, _viâ_\r\noverhead wires, returning to its place of birth by another rail or\r\ncable, and completing its circuit. It is “picked up” by a small\r\nlocomotive fitted with motors that work the driving-mechanism, and thus\r\npropels the coaches or cars behind it at varying speeds.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of the dynamos is effected either by a torrent, waterfall,\r\nor swift-flowing river, absorbed by turbines, or by steam supplied from\r\nordinary boilers.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we convert our water and coal into steam, and,\r\nindirectly, the heat in the steam into electrical energy; and the heavy\r\nlocomotive that used to carry its own fuel, and manufacture its steam as\r\nit tore along with the train behind it, now leaves tender and boiler at\r\nhome, and has its driving power, in the form of electric current,\r\nforwarded to it per centre rail, to be drawn upon when wanted.\r\n\r\nThe system is beautifully simple, and the machinery compact and\r\nuncomplicated. Smoke defilement is unknown, and the trains are\r\ncomparatively noiseless. In short, electric traction is the refinement\r\nof mechanically applied power.\r\n\r\nNow let us visit an electrical power station--a small one--and I have in\r\nmy mind that of the Waterloo and City Electric Railway.\r\n\r\nHidden away behind a bewildering labyrinth of railway arches, in a\r\n_cul-de-sac_, approached from a back street, not a hundred miles from a\r\ngreat railway station, is a plain, very plain brick building, wherein,\r\nfor aught one knows to the contrary, such prosaic articles as pots and\r\npans, or cardboard boxes, may be in course of manufacture. Pass through\r\na door, always on the swing, and an unpretending office is reached,\r\nfurnished in the usual manner, and occupied by clerks engaged upon the\r\nordinary duties of their vocation.\r\n\r\nAccess to the engineer-in-chief being granted, he courteously conducts\r\nus to the power room, whence issues the energy that drives the trains.\r\n\r\nImagination had pictured a great hall, filled with ponderous machinery\r\nwhose component parts are cranks, steel rods, shafts, and toothed\r\nwheels, a wilderness of metal, moving with bewildering rapidity and\r\nthunderous power, in an atmosphere redolent of lubricating oil, a vision\r\nof whirling wheels, an Ezekiel vision of wheels in the midst of wheels,\r\ninstinct with life, such as the prophet saw 600 years B.C., by the River\r\nChebar, in the land of the Chaldean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. NINE WILLANS-SIEMENS DYNAMO SETS FOR ELECTRIC\r\nTRACTION, 700 H.P. EACH.\r\n\r\n_By permission of_ _Willans and Robinson, Ltd., Rugby_]\r\n\r\nNothing of the kind! One portion of a moderate-sized apartment is\r\ndevoted to the “fitting” of the motor locomotives, and at the other end,\r\nenclosed within a low railing, resting upon a bed of great solidity,\r\nand occupying but little space, is the machinery in duplicate, as a\r\nsafeguard against breakdowns.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a vertical compound engine, supplied with steam from an\r\nadjoining boiler-house, whose cylinder is coupled direct to the\r\nfly-wheels of the revolving dynamos that are partly sunk into the\r\nflooring. These, with their electro-magnets, are so shut in, and so\r\nlittle can be seen of the working, that it all looks very mysterious and\r\nincomprehensible to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nIn large power-producing machinery an iron staircase leads up to a\r\nplatform above the dynamos, giving access to the loftier parts of the\r\napparatus, which then, in its general appearance and compactness,\r\nsomewhat resembles a modern marine engine. On the walls are endless\r\ndials, recording the amount of current generated, localising the exact\r\nposition of the trains on the line at any given moment, and checking the\r\nquantity of current picked up by each engine. There is absolutely no\r\nsmell, no outward indication of resistless power, while almost Arcadian\r\nquiet reigns in the neighbourhood of the machines.\r\n\r\nThat these small dynamos are capable of driving heavy cars filled with\r\npassengers at the rate of many miles an hour seems incredible; but\r\nfaith, “the evidence of things not seen,” must come into play.\r\n\r\nThe craving for mere size, however, will be amply gratified when the\r\ngreat power house at Chelsea, built to supply the Metropolitan,\r\nDistrict, and other railways, is completed (_vide_ Chapter V.).\r\n\r\nBut what on earth is a kilowatt, or a volt, an ohm, or an\r\nampère?--expressions that are rapidly becoming as familiar as the word\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\nWell, “horse-power” was a term invented long ago by engineers, who\r\nblandly asked one to imagine that an ordinary horse was capable of\r\nlifting a weight of 33,000 lbs. (or some 14½ tons) one foot high per\r\nminute. Now, electricity is a very exact science. There is no mere\r\ntheory about it; and a unit is a definite quantity of power, known in\r\nthat science as a “kilowatt hour.” Thus, a kilowatt, or 1,000 watts, is\r\nthe equivalent in measured work of 1⅓ horse-power, equal to the lifting\r\nof 44,000 lbs. per minute, or the doing of so many units of work, either\r\nelectric lighting, heating, machinery driving, or traction.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS FORMS OF ELECTRIC LOCOMOTION\r\n\r\nElectricity as a locomotive force is being presented to the public in\r\nvarious forms. There is the ordinary railway, like the Underground,\r\nthat, cleansing itself, amending its ways, and becoming converted to the\r\nnew order of traction, has been granted a new lease of life. Then there\r\nare new lines laid down, intended from the first to be electrical, with\r\nspecially designed cars, diving beneath the Thames, and connecting the\r\nnorth and south of London. These are our metropolitan pioneer electric\r\nrailways. There is also the system of railways specifically and\r\npopularly known as Tubes, most important factors in the travelling world\r\nof modern Babylon. Another division is the system known as Overhead\r\nElectric Railways; that is to say, rails laid upon iron girders\r\nsupported by columns above the roadway, a notable example of which is\r\nthe Liverpool Overhead Electric Railway.\r\n\r\nElectric tramways are with us in Greater London for good and all, with\r\ntheir network of lines in every direction. Some are locally worked by\r\nthe various Borough Councils; others on a comprehensive scale by the\r\nLondon County Council, who now strongly advocate also another system,\r\nthe Shallow-Underground, by which the cars run in a kind of open trench\r\njust below the surface in the middle of the street.\r\n\r\nNext we have endless provincial and urban council electric tramways,\r\nincluding some very extensive systems for feeding the enormous traffic\r\nof cities and large towns in the Midlands and North of England.\r\n\r\nElectric Light Railways, originally intended to be worked on rails laid\r\ndown upon the ordinary highway, form a special class by themselves to\r\nserve short-distance traffic in country districts; but to all intents\r\nand purposes they are rural electric trams.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have motor-cars, carriages, omnibuses, cabs, vans, and\r\ncycles, that with electricity as their means of propulsion, will\r\npossibly ere long supersede every other form of traffic in our streets\r\nand along our roads and lanes.\r\n\r\nTo individualise these various outcomes of electrical traction spread\r\nover the length and breadth of Great Britain is impossible. Their names\r\nand their statistics are enrolled in _Garcke’s Manual of Electrical\r\nUndertakings_, a work that, like _Kelly’s London Directory_, grows\r\nbigger and bigger every year.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, only to notice some of the principal ones; and,\r\nnaturally, the pioneer railway lines should have the place of honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_SOME PIONEER ELECTRIC RAILWAYS_\r\n\r\n“A worthy pioneer.”--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT’S CAUSEWAY RAILWAY\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1883, by the opening of the Giant’s Causeway,\r\nPortrush, and Bush Valley Railway, the sister island achieved the honour\r\nand glory of showing the way to the “predominant partner” in the matter\r\nof electrical traction enterprise; winning, however, only by a head, for\r\nin August of the same year the Brighton Beach Electric Railway was\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\nWho amongst us can say they know Ireland well? To the average tourist it\r\nstill remains an unexplored country. The travelling American, however,\r\nas a rule, does it from end to end. Commencing with Dublin, “doing”\r\nKillarney, and working round the magnificent west coast, he returns\r\n_viâ_ the North Channel, always taking _en route_ on the coast of Antrim\r\nthe Giant’s Causeway, thundered upon by storms from the wild Atlantic.\r\nThere, almost within hail of Britain, are those strange groups of\r\nbasaltic columns so familiar to geological students, intensely\r\ninteresting, invested with many an old and mystic Celtic legend, yet\r\nuntil recently difficult of access, as other striking regions in\r\nIreland--an island abounding not only in awe-inspiring scenery, but in\r\nsequestered spots of sylvan beauty; a fair land of mountains and hills,\r\nlakes and waterfalls, crystal streams, and splendid harbours; truly\r\ncalled the Emerald Isle; where the grass is greenest, and rare coniferæ\r\nflourish; where the myrtle needs no shelter, and the arbutus blooms and\r\nfruits to perfection, and flowers are everywhere, for every little\r\nenclosure in due season glows with the brightest of flax and potato\r\nblossom; and lanes and open country are gay with star-like marigolds,\r\nshamrock, violets, honeysuckle, meadowsweet, catsear, scabious, large\r\npurple bugle, and such-like lowly but welcome plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. THE GIANT’S CAUSEWAY.\r\n\r\n_By permission of_ _Thos. Cook and Son, Ludgate Circus_]\r\n\r\nFrom Portrush it is easy to reach the Causeway, though once there, one\r\noften has to wait for favourable weather before proceeding to explore\r\nits cavernous wonders by water.\r\n\r\nThe present length of the railway is 8½ miles of single line, its gauge\r\nbeing 3 feet. It is worked partly by steam and partly by electricity on\r\nthe overhead system, the current being derived from a generating station\r\nthree-quarters of a mile away, where three hydraulic turbines, fed by an\r\nadjoining waterfall, operate the dynamo. Although the railway is out of\r\nthe way and on a small scale, the attractions of the Causeway and the\r\nsurrounding district result in a respectable passenger traffic of over a\r\nhundred thousand per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRIGHTON BEACH RAILWAY\r\n\r\nUnder the sanction of the Brighton Town Council, the Magnus Volk Co.,\r\nLtd., now work the Brighton Beach Electric Tram-railway, which at its\r\nopening was regarded as a great novelty and curiosity, constituting an\r\nadditional attraction and amusement to “London by the sea,” and tens of\r\nthousands must have taken a ride in its little open cars since it came\r\ninto existence twenty years ago. The gauge is but 2 feet 8½ inches, the\r\n“feeders” are underground, the propelling system is electric, with a\r\nthird rail, and its speed is about 12 miles an hour. Starting from the\r\nwest pier, opposite the Royal Aquarium, it sets out on its one mile and\r\na half route of single line and dips beneath the level of the Marine\r\nParade to a level a little above the beach, passing _en route_, though\r\nhidden from view, many landmarks of old Brighton, such as Park Place and\r\nGardens, Royal Crescent, Marine Square, and Lewes Crescent, and\r\nterminating at a point near Black Rock.\r\n\r\nThis was the eastern end of Old Brighton, noted for many an original\r\ncharacter in the “twenties” and “thirties,” not the least interesting of\r\nwhom were old Martha Gunn, queen of the bathing-machines, and Sak Deen\r\nMahomed, a native of the East, who introduced the art of shampooing into\r\nthe town, and lived to become a centenarian, his fame being enshrined in\r\nverse by James Smith, one of the authors of _Rejected Addresses_, who\r\nhumorously predicted his longevity as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “Sprung doubtless from Abdullah’s son,\r\n     Thy miracles thy sire’s outrun,\r\n         Thy cures his deaths outnumber;\r\n     His coffin soars ’twixt heav’n and earth,\r\n     But thou, within that narrow berth,\r\n         Immortal, ne’er shall slumber.”\r\n\r\nMany have been the changes in Brighton since those days. Arundel\r\nTerrace, Kemp Town, Ultima Thule in the east; Adelaide Crescent with\r\nPalmyra Square, its western boundary. From the fields to the north of\r\nthat square could be seen, a mile or so off, the village of Hove, the\r\nintervening space being dotted with farms. No one could have dreamt that\r\na great railway-station would be built there, with minor ones at Kemp\r\nTown, West Brighton, and Hove. Old residents could not have pictured a\r\nGrand Aquarium, a Western and Eastern Pier, nor the destruction of their\r\nfamiliar Chain Pier. They would be amazed at the spread of Brighton in\r\nevery direction, the springing up of palatial hotels like the\r\n“Métropole” and “Grand,” and the increase of the population to some\r\nhundred and fifty thousand; while the coaching world, headed by the\r\npopular Sir St. Vincent Cotton, prince of amateur whips, and all the\r\nconfraternity of coachmen and hackney-coach drivers, would have thought\r\nanyone a lunatic who had dared to prophesy that one day a conveyance\r\ndrawn without horses or steam power would carry passengers along the\r\nBrighton beach!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY AND SOUTH LONDON RAILWAY\r\n\r\nFor many years prior to 1890, in Gracechurch Street, at a point near its\r\njunction with Eastcheap, could be seen every day of the week numerous\r\nomnibuses arriving between nine and eleven a.m., and departing between\r\nfive and eight p.m., for the suburbs over the water. These ’buses\r\nregularly plied between London and Kennington, Walworth, Camberwell,\r\nStockwell, Clapham, and Brixton (a few journeying to Dulwich and\r\nPeckham), for the special accommodation of dwellers in those favourite\r\nlocalities engaged in business during the day. Wealthy “principals” of\r\nmercantile and brokers’ firms drove to and from their comfortable Surrey\r\nvillas in well-equipped carriages, the junior members in smart traps or\r\ndog-carts; but the small merchants and smaller brokers, the head clerks\r\nand the rank and file who do all the hard work, had to make use of these\r\nomnibuses, and when exceptionally bad weather prevented the vehicles\r\nrunning, they had to get to and from their offices as best they could on\r\nfoot. To the working man, living, say, at Brixton, and engaged upon a\r\nCity job, the fares--4_d._ to 8_d._--were prohibitive. The time wasted\r\nin these conveyances was great, and at the best it was an unpleasant way\r\nof travelling; overcrowding was common, and the “fight for the trams” in\r\n1903 is as nothing compared to the frantic rush for those omnibus seats;\r\nwhile on wet days the sight was piteous.\r\n\r\nIt is true that City men could use the London, Chatham, and Dover\r\nRailway, to reach these suburbs, but this involved a walk to Blackfriars\r\nStation, and the facing of the crush on its dangerous platforms. There\r\nwere also the alternatives of crossing Blackfriars Bridge and using the\r\nLondon Tramway Company’s horse-cars, or of forcing one’s way over\r\nLondon Bridge, tramping or “bussing” it along the Borough High Street,\r\nand, emerging at the “Elephant and Castle,” there tapping the trams.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, these ingenious alternative routes were seldom made\r\nuse of. At the close of business, men of all ranks want to get home as\r\nfast as they can, and from some station not far from their\r\ncounting-houses. Therefore, in the days I am describing, how could any\r\nof those gentlemen clad in irreproachable frock-coats and new glossy\r\nhats, who each day of the week issued from snug offices in Austin\r\nFriars, Drapers’ Gardens, or Copthall Court, whose business was\r\ntransacted over the way at the “House”; how could the brokers of Mark\r\nLane and Mincing Lane, the underwriters at Lloyd’s, the ship-brokers and\r\nship-owners round about Fenchurch Street and Leadenhall Street, the\r\nflourishing bill-brokers of Broad Street, and the smaller mercantile\r\nfry; how could any of these, if resident on the Surrey side, be expected\r\nto go to and from business by way of Blackfriars?\r\n\r\nHowever, this unsatisfactory means of communication was hardly likely to\r\nescape the notice of such astute experts as Mr. J. C. Mott, doyen\r\ndirector of the Great Western Railway, and his far-seeing friends. They\r\ntook counsel together, and, after the usual hard task of _persuading_\r\npeople, plans were matured, and in 1884 an enterprise was organised and\r\nincorporated as the City of London and Southwark Subway Company, to\r\nconstruct a line of railway from King William Street to the “Elephant\r\nand Castle,” with an intermediate station at Marshalsea Road.\r\n\r\nThis was the initial stage of the present well-known railway.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, three points had to be considered. How was the subway to\r\nbe constructed? What motive power should be employed? And how was the\r\ndeep level to be reached by the passengers? A subway under the Thames\r\nwas no novelty. The directors of the new line were not the “first that\r\never burst into that silent sea” of mud and gravel at the bottom of the\r\nswift-flowing river. Brunel had been long before them with his costly\r\nThames Tunnel, and Barlow had years ago laid upon its oozy bed the Tower\r\nSubway of iron.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that a tube, or, rather, two independent tunnels of\r\ncast-iron rings, should be driven side by side beneath the bottom of the\r\nstream, a little to the west of London Bridge, and continued on the\r\nSurrey side.\r\n\r\nOn this system the work was begun by the contractors, Siemens Brothers\r\nand Mather and Platt, and proceeded with quite out of public sight. It\r\nwas accompanied with many disheartening delays and seemingly\r\ninsurmountable difficulties; but they were all successfully overcome,\r\nand the tubes were brought to a temporary end at the “Swan,” Stockwell,\r\nto which charming retreat, by an Act of Parliament, 1887, an extension\r\nof the line had been sanctioned, making its length a little over three\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe motive power eventually selected was electricity, steam being\r\nimpracticable, and the funicular or cable system considered unreliable.\r\nAccess to and from the trains was to be obtained at the stations by\r\nmeans of capacious twin-lifts capable of holding many people at a time.\r\n\r\nThen the problem of how best to utilise the ample “power,” generated at\r\nthe Stockwell Station, for hauling the cars, had to be seriously\r\ntackled. It was not a question of a toy line like that on the Brighton\r\nbeach, but of the driving at fair speed, say 15 miles an hour, of\r\ncomparatively heavy coaches laden with passengers, and at frequent\r\nintervals. Altogether it was a new departure in electric traction.\r\n\r\nHow the motor locomotives were effectually to pick up the current was\r\nthe puzzle which had to be solved, or the enterprise might at the last\r\nmoment collapse and the subscribed capital be lost.\r\n\r\nAfter an infinite amount of anxious experimenting on the part of Mr.\r\nMott and his scientific advisers--the narrative of which, as told me by\r\nthat veteran, sounded like a romance--by a happy inspiration _the_ way\r\nwas hit upon; and all other technical difficulties overcome, the line\r\nwas pronounced to be in working order (1890), after a series of trial\r\ntrips, at one of which the writer had the privilege of being present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_SOME PIONEER ELECTRIC RAILWAYS_ (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRIAL TRIP IN THE CITY AND SOUTH LONDON RAILWAY\r\n\r\nOne o’clock saw a large party of us, chiefly City men, amongst whom were\r\nnumerous civil engineers, waiting at King William Street booking-office\r\nto descend into the bowels of the earth by one of the semicircular\r\nlifts, a novelty in point of size. Our turn having come, we duly filed\r\ninto the elevator. The telescopic doors clashed upon us, and we stood\r\nfor a second or two silently expectant, feeling like a batch of\r\ncondemned criminals on a gigantic scaffold waiting for the hangman to\r\ndraw back the fatal lever that would launch them into the other world.\r\n\r\nNoiselessly the lift descended to an apparently fathomless depth, but in\r\nreality, I believe, some 90 or 100 feet. When released by the janitor,\r\nwe found ourselves in a small, well-lighted, cool, and spotlessly clean,\r\nwhite-tiled station, whence was discernible a couple of small tunnels\r\nside by side, leading to unknown regions, seemingly all too narrow to\r\naccommodate even the miniature cars waiting for us at one of the narrow\r\nplatforms.\r\n\r\nInspecting the tunnels, the classical man of our party, a wag in his\r\nway, who had hitherto made no remark, was heard to mutter something in\r\nLatin, which, on being coerced, he admitted was out of Virgil, and was\r\ntranslated thus: “This is the spot where the way divides in two\r\nbranches.” In vain we pointed out that the quotation was inappropriate,\r\nas the ways were _parallel_. He was obdurate, so we left him to his own\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nTo most of us accustomed to roomy Pullmans and commodious railway\r\ncarriages, the cars, though comfortable, seemed cramped, especially in\r\nheight. The signal given, off we started, when we noticed that the cars\r\nfitted the tube with such nicety and economy of space that, could the\r\nwindows have been let down, we could easily have touched the iron plates\r\nof the tunnel. We realised, too, that although there was no smoke or\r\nsmell, the railway was by no means noiseless; neither, in the opinion of\r\nseveral of the experts present, was the running as steady as on the\r\n“Underground.”\r\n\r\nA hint had been given us that at some point where the line dipped and\r\nrose again the cars might come to a temporary standstill. As we rather\r\nuneasily recalled this, the speed gradually slackened, and finally the\r\ntrain stopped altogether, and simultaneously the incandescent lights\r\nbegan to pale, and at last subsided into filaments of sickly red. The\r\nsituation was not a pleasant one. There we were; many of us with\r\nimportant engagements awaiting us later in the day; most of us with\r\nwives and children who would expect us home as usual when evening\r\narrived, and grow anxious at our absence. There we were sealed up in a\r\ntube, for all we knew, at a point beneath the Thames. Not a sound\r\nreached us from the locomotive, or, indeed, from anywhere. Were we thus\r\nto remain indefinitely? For walk out we could not, there being no room\r\noutside the carriages. Would some memorial tablet let into the side of\r\nLondon Bridge, months hence, recall the fact that near it a goodly\r\ncompany of highly respectable citizens had perished in a living tomb?\r\n\r\nI don’t think we talked much. It was luncheon-time; we were hungry, and\r\nwe felt like the occupants of the snowed-up cars in one of Mark Twain’s\r\nstories, who gloomily eyed one another as starvation threatened,\r\ncalculating upon whom, by an ingenious and complicated system of voting\r\npreviously agreed to, would next fall the lot of being sacrificed for\r\nthe benefit of the rest, and I believe I found myself unconsciously\r\nspeculating on the plumpness of a youthful stockbroker standing by my\r\nside. But after a very few moments of suspense the train rattled on\r\nagain, the lights reappeared, and presently we drew up at the Borough,\r\nthe first station on the Surrey side.\r\n\r\nRailway booking-offices are not usually things of beauty, least of all\r\nthose on the Metropolitan, District, and suburban lines. Here, however,\r\nwas a surprise, for we found quite a picturesque stone-and-brick\r\nbuilding on the ground-floor, a cupola surmounting the prettily designed\r\nentrance, and a small dome with lantern by way of roof. And this was a\r\nsample of all the stations along the line.\r\n\r\nThe Borough recalled the Marshalsea that once stood close by; and there\r\nopposite was St. George’s, Southwark, where Little Dorrit, accidentally\r\nlocked out of the prison, was allowed by “the sexton, or the beadle, or\r\nthe verger, or whatever he was,” to take refuge in the vestry, where,\r\nyears afterwards, she signed the marriage register when wedded to Arthur\r\nClennam.\r\n\r\nThe next stoppage was at the Elephant and Castle--not the tavern of that\r\nname, where in the past on Derby Day the superabundant holiday traffic\r\nusually became hopelessly congested, but the City and South London’s new\r\nstation, close to Spurgeon’s Tabernacle, Rabbits’ great boot warehouse,\r\nand Tarn’s vast emporium, that seems to occupy most of Newington\r\nCauseway. Onwards to Kennington Common, once the place of public\r\nexecutions for Surrey, now a well-kept miniature park. Beyond it,\r\nKennington Oval, associated with cricket all the world over; and finally\r\nwe arrived at Stockwell, the then terminus of the line, since extended\r\nto Clapham, where Tom Hood used to go to school at a house “with ugly\r\nwindows ten in a row, its chimney in the rear,” a style of architecture\r\nof which many specimens still exist round and about the Common.\r\n\r\nAt Stockwell we visited the generating station, recently much extended,\r\nand provided with entirely new plant, and, wondering at and admiring all\r\nwe saw, learned from the chief engineer that the contretemps _en route_\r\nwas due to a slight defect in the new and untried power-machinery; and\r\nthus at the point where the dip in the line was greatest, the cars\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nAn excellent luncheon restored us all to eloquence and equanimity,\r\nextinguishing the cannibalistic feeling of half an hour ago, and,\r\nreturning without any incident worth recording, we emerged once more in\r\nthe City, to be greeted by the noise of the traffic that ever surges\r\naround King William the Fourth’s statue.\r\n\r\nThose were the “green salad” days of London’s Pioneer Electric Railway\r\nLine. Now it runs without a hitch, and has been extended north as far as\r\nthe historic “Angel,” thus giving a direct route between Clapham and\r\nIslington. It has powers to exchange traffic with the Great Northern and\r\nthe City Railway _viâ_ Old Street, and also to connect itself with the\r\nBaker Street and Waterloo Electric Railway at the Elephant and Castle\r\nStation; and in a new building at Finsbury Pavement it now has\r\ncommodious head offices.\r\n\r\nAt the last half-yearly general meeting the chairman, Mr. C. G. Mott, in\r\nthe course of his speech, stated that the Board aspired to have a\r\nthoroughly first-class terminus in the City of London, and had deposited\r\nplans with this view. They proposed to construct this station between\r\nthe present Bank Station and the King William Street statue.\r\n\r\nThat the City and South London Railway is most useful and popular is\r\nshown by the number of passengers it has carried--some ninety millions\r\nsince its opening--the returns for last year showing about eighteen\r\nmillions, over a total route of about seven miles. For the convenience\r\nof travellers, it eventually will have subways, connecting its Lombard\r\nStreet Station with the Bank Station of the Central London Railway, and\r\nit already has them from its new London Bridge Station to the London,\r\nBrighton, and South Coast Railway. Finally, it can boast of possessing a\r\nstation below a church--a unique position, I believe. St. Mary\r\nWoolnoth’s foundations were completely removed, the vaults cleared out,\r\nand the whole replaced by huge iron girders, whereon the sacred edifice\r\nnow rests, with the booking-office below.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATERLOO AND CITY RAILWAY\r\n\r\nThe month of August, 1898, was unusually warm, and the heat was felt as\r\nmuch in the City as anywhere. Straw hats were universal; the shady side\r\nof the street, if there happened to be one, was thronged; secluded\r\nalleys and courts were resorted to by the knowing ones who could afford\r\nthe time to linger there; and even highly respectable merchants were to\r\nbe found sitting in shirt-sleeves at their writing-tables and wishing,\r\nwith Sydney Smith, that they could “sit in their bones.”\r\n\r\nAt the junction of the Poultry with Victoria Street, shadowed by the\r\nMansion House, from each side of the road a mysterious hoarding had just\r\nbeen removed, revealing an iron railing enclosing a small area with a\r\nmysterious staircase bearing the announcement that it led to the subway\r\nto the new electric railway, connecting the City with Waterloo Station.\r\nDescending a few steps, and emerging into a tunnelled incline, the\r\nperspiring pedestrian quickly found that here, if anywhere, was a refuge\r\nfrom the heat, the coolest place in London, and that it was well worth\r\nwhile, on the pretence of urgent business across the water, to pay\r\ntwopence each way, merely to drink in the refreshing air wafted\r\nbackwards and forwards along subway, platform, and tube.\r\n\r\nThis was the Waterloo and City Railway, a short deep-level line on the\r\ntube principle, nearly 1¾ miles long, burrowing under the Thames’ bed.\r\nAt the terminus, by rather prolonged inclines and staircases, passengers\r\ncould walk to the main or suburban platforms of Waterloo Station and\r\ncatch the trains for Wimbledon, Hampton Court, Surbiton, etc.\r\n\r\nLike the City and South London, this railway meets a great want. Before\r\nits opening, City men living down the London and South Western line had\r\nno alternative but to catch a South Eastern train from Cannon Street or\r\nCharing Cross; to take an omnibus _viâ_ the Strand across to Waterloo\r\nBridge; or to cab it by devious routes _viâ_ Blackfriars Bridge. Now\r\nthey can reach Waterloo with ease, comfort, and economy.\r\n\r\nUnder agreement, the line is worked by the London and South Western\r\nRailway Company. The electrical equipment is by the famous firm of\r\nSiemens Brothers, the generating station being up a blind alley\r\nadjoining\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. WATERLOO AND CITY RAILWAY’S NEW PATTERN CAR\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _“Tramway and Railway World” Publishing Co.,\r\nLondon_]\r\n\r\nthe dismal arched entrance to Waterloo from York Road. Each train seats\r\n208 passengers; the average speed is 18 miles an hour, and its\r\nusefulness is proved by the fact that over two and a half million\r\nordinary passengers were carried by it in one half-year, _i.e._ to\r\nDecember 31st, 1902 (not counting season-ticket holders), while the\r\nreceipts for that period were £17,400.\r\n\r\nDuring the busy hours of morning and evening the large trains are used\r\nand always fill up rapidly, but in the slack times of midday single\r\nmotor-cars, each carrying 50 passengers, are sufficient to cope with the\r\ntraffic. The cars are rather stuffy, and, like the train cars, are\r\nnarrow and low. At each end is a small partitioned-off “cab,” where sits\r\na motor-man. No tickets are issued from the booking-office; but, as in\r\nan omnibus, the conductor comes round and collects the fares, giving a\r\npunched voucher in return, which is retained by the traveller.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIVERPOOL OVERHEAD ELECTRIC RAILWAY\r\n\r\nThere are few overhead, or, rather, elevated, railways in the world.\r\nSomehow they do not seem to be popular, and the tendency, in England at\r\nleast, is rather towards burrowing like the mole, than soaring above the\r\nstreet level.\r\n\r\nIn Germany there is a wonderful instance of electrically driven overhead\r\nline between Elberfeld and Barmen, on the mono-rail principle, the\r\ntrains hanging from tracks suspended high above rivers and public roads.\r\nAt the great Beckton gas works there has been in use since 1894 an\r\niron-built miniature railway elevated on pillars, and it is a curious\r\nsight to witness busy little engines incessantly hauling coal trucks\r\nfrom the pier to the retort houses. An ingenious example of the\r\nelevated principle is to be seen at the Victoria Station, Manchester,\r\nwhere a railway on a very reduced scale conveys passengers’ luggage from\r\none platform to another, and idlers are never tired of watching it. The\r\ntrack, a double one, is suspended from the roof and runs between\r\nplatforms five and six. The motive power is electricity, and the motor\r\nis placed between the wheels and the track, and it lifts and lowers a\r\nbasket which holds about 15 cwt. of luggage.\r\n\r\nA wonderful instance of a _very_ elevated railway existed at Beachy Head\r\nwhile the new lighthouse was being built 600 feet distant from the base\r\nof the cliff, at that point 400 feet high. It conveyed material to the\r\nsite, the descending load drawing up the ascending empty “skip” on the\r\noverhead suspension principle.\r\n\r\nOur New York cousins have, in their elevated steam railway, long been\r\nfamiliarised with the system, but for Londoners it possesses the fatal\r\nobjection that the occupants of the cars as they pass along can look\r\ninto the front windows of the houses and spy upon the occupants. Running\r\nalong docks, however, elevated railways are not objectionable; and the\r\nearliest example, in this or any other country, of electricity applied\r\nto overhead traction is at Liverpool.\r\n\r\nExtending along the Mersey--that noble river whose tidal movement is\r\nsaid to be four times the outfall of the Mississippi--for a distance of\r\n6½ miles are the Liverpool Docks, in importance undoubtedly the first in\r\nthe world, but, until the Overhead Railway was opened, exasperatingly\r\ninaccessible to business men whose time was valuable, and bewildering to\r\nstrangers by reason of their immensity.\r\n\r\nAlong the line of dock, it is true, ran broad-wheeled omnibuses built to\r\nrun on the low-level dock railway, but so slow, in consequence of the\r\npressure of traffic and the necessity for frequent shuntings for the\r\npassage of goods trains, that to reach the farthest dock usually\r\noccupied over an hour. To improve upon this it was proposed, as far back\r\nas 1852, to construct a high-level railway; but nothing practical came\r\nof it until 1888, when the Liverpool Overhead Railway Company took over\r\nthe parliamentary powers obtained by the Dock Board, and setting\r\nsteadily to work, created their line for passengers only, and, from the\r\nfirst, achieved a great success, the number of travellers amounting to\r\nmany millions annually.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of February, 1893, the railway was appropriately opened by\r\nthe ex-Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, whose devotion to the science of\r\nelectricity is well known. Pressing a button at the base of a silver\r\ninkstand (subsequently presented to the Marquis as a memento), the\r\nengines that generated the electric current were set in motion, and by\r\nspecial train his lordship was conveyed over the seven miles of line,\r\nand afterwards entertained at a banquet by the Mayor, when, in an\r\nexcellent speech, he dilated upon the prospect of electricity becoming\r\nthe motive power of the age.\r\n\r\nIn the following month the railway was opened for public traffic, and,\r\nwith its thirteen stations, its five minutes’ service, and its cheap\r\nfares, practically extinguished the omnibuses, light or heavy.\r\n\r\nFrom the Overhead Railway a splendid view is obtained of the busiest\r\nlocality perhaps in the empire. Below are the railway trucks packed\r\nclose with imported merchandise of all kinds: cotton from America and\r\nthe East; grain from the ends of the earth; beef, bacon, cheese, butter,\r\nflour, and fruit from the New World; wool and tallow from Australia and\r\nArgentina. Waggons\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. THE LIVERPOOL OVERHEAD ELECTRIC RAILWAY\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Liverpool Overhead Electric Railway Co._]\r\n\r\nand carts filled with Manchester goods, hardware, machinery, chemicals,\r\nand every imaginable kind of manufactured goods are alongside the big\r\nliners that come into port, discharge their cargoes, load up, and are\r\nout in the Mersey and off to sea again in a few days. Truly Liverpool is\r\na wonderful place, and although her greatness as a seaport has been\r\nthreatened by the opening of the Ship Canal to Manchester, it will be a\r\nlong day before she surrenders her claim to be the chief marine approach\r\nto Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_REMARKABLE ELECTRIC RAILWAYS_\r\n\r\n“Behold they shall come with speed swiftly.”--ISAIAH v. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONO-RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nA one-rail railway! What kind of novelty can that be, emanating no doubt\r\nfrom the prolific brain of some enthusiastic engineer possessed with an\r\nidea, a fad, a craze--call it what you will! We are accustomed to highly\r\nrespectable trains running in an orthodox manner on double rails. A\r\nprojected, many-railed track we have also heard of to carry ships bodily\r\nacross the Isthmus of Panama. But the idea of a single-rail “Flying\r\nDutchman” or “Wild Irishman” seems chimerical.\r\n\r\nIt is not so, however, and the system has been solemnly and deliberately\r\nsanctioned by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nNowadays one need not be astonished at anything. Take cycling, for\r\ninstance. Long ago, when velocipedes--three or four-wheeled, uncanny\r\nmachines--were mere toys wherewith youths loved to dislocate their\r\njoints on the lower terraces of the Crystal Palace, no one dreamt that\r\nbicycles, outraging all the laws of gravitation and practically\r\nmono-wheeled, would ere long be used on road and field and moor, on\r\nmountain-side, on steppe and desert, over barren Asiatic tundras and\r\nsnow-clad Yukon plains--in short, wherever adventurous mankind has\r\npenetrated.\r\n\r\nThe mono-rail train, like a bicycle, runs on one linear track, but,\r\nunlike that hopelessly collapsible machine, requires no balancing, and\r\ncannot capsize, and under proper conditions is the safest known method\r\nof travelling at very great speed.\r\n\r\n“_Faire prose sans le savoir_” is a familiar aphorism of Molière, but\r\nperhaps it would astonish most of us to be calmly told by modern\r\nengineers that all our lives we have, _without knowing it_, been\r\ntravelling on mono-railways! They assert that although it is true that\r\nthe ordinary engine with its coaches rests on a _pair_ of rails, the\r\nfact that the space between the rails is cut away is immaterial, as it\r\nis rendered a single track by the rigidity of the carriage axles, and if\r\nthese were loose, of course the train would overturn.\r\n\r\nNature has no example of mono-railwayism (to coin an expression), unless\r\nit be the gossamer or shooting spider, that upon a single invisible\r\nthread spun from its body ascends to aerial heights on a kind of\r\nself-manufactured mono-rail, Dame Nature being too lavish and too wise,\r\nin the perfect freedom she accords to birds, beasts, fishes, and\r\ninsects, to restrict their movements to one undeviating path.\r\n\r\nIn the moral world there have always been mono-railists, men of one\r\nfixed idea, from which they could not, or would not, budge--apostles of\r\nan ambition, a creed, a theory, a political conviction. The world has\r\nhad its Alexander the Great, its Napoleon, Buddha, St. Paul, Mahomet,\r\nMartin Luther, Ignatius Loyola, Wycliffe, its Palissy, George\r\nStephenson, Mungo Park, John Bright, and Cobden.\r\n\r\nIt has been left to the inventive mechanical genius of the nineteenth\r\ncentury to develop the mono-rail system. Doubtless those inscrutable\r\npeople, the Chinese, knew of it, and applied it in some way long ago;\r\nand perhaps the yet more mysterious dwellers in ancient Egypt--whence\r\nall wisdom seems to have descended--utilised it after some unknown\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nBlondin, in his marvellous feat of trundling a wheel-barrow containing\r\na man along the high-level rope, used a hempen mono-rail; and the wire\r\ncables stretching across the Thames at the reconstructed bridges at Kew\r\nand Vauxhall, acting as travelling ways to convey the excavated soil\r\nfrom the coffer-dams in large iron “skips” or buckets, were another\r\nspecies of mono-rail; while at home in brickfields, and in mines, and on\r\nplantations in distant lands, miniature railways have been used for\r\nyears to carry clay, ore, and produce, over plain and hill and dale.\r\n\r\nIn India a peculiar kind of tramway truck has been in use for some time,\r\nwith two or three flanged wheels which run on a single rail, and a large\r\nbalance-wheel on one side of the truck to prevent it toppling over.\r\nProduce of all kinds can easily be drawn upon it by a couple of coolies,\r\nand its efficiency on country roads has been highly spoken of.\r\n\r\nGermany presents us with a recent and curious example of the application\r\nof the principle to locomotion. In the Wupper Valley near Dusseldorf and\r\nCologne there are two towns, Barmen and Elberfeld, about eight miles\r\napart, mutually engaged in chemical and textile industries, and this\r\nseparation of the sister-towns was an obvious disadvantage to both. But\r\nnow they are joined by a wonderful railway, constructed on an elevated\r\nline running six miles of its course above the River Wupper, a tributary\r\nof the Rhine, some sixty to a hundred feet wide. The carriages are\r\nsuspended, and work upon a single rail, a development of the travelling\r\ncable-way system. This rail is rigidly fastened to an iron framework of\r\ngirders, and supports the cars hanging therefrom by means of two steel\r\n“bogies” with two wheels. Thus they can pass round sharp curves without\r\nslackening speed and with the greatest safety, its motive power,\r\nelectricity, being applied by two motors on each carriage which drive\r\nboth wheels with equal force at a speed fixed at thirty-one miles an\r\nhour, and attainable fifteen seconds after starting.\r\n\r\nAs elevated railways of this type are somewhat costly, and a simpler and\r\ncheaper form would be a desideratum, a short line across country was\r\nbuilt as an experiment at Cologne-Deutz. The stays, measuring from 9·6\r\nfeet to 28·5 feet, were made either of wood, or of iron tubes, and met\r\nat the top in a cap, from which was jointed the sheet-iron supports that\r\ncarried the mono-rail. By means of this jointed connection, the strain\r\nwas always of a central character, and, therefore, more easily borne. At\r\nintervals of about 660 feet a couple of stays were firmly braced\r\ntogether, in order to give stability to the overhead structure and to\r\ntake up the longitudinal thrust. In consequence, even with light\r\nlocomotives, the traction power was very high, and on the line at Deutz\r\nit was found that a locomotive drawing two carriages full of passengers\r\ncould ascend a gradient of 1 in 6 with perfect safety.\r\n\r\nBut a means of adapting a mono-rail to every condition had some time\r\nbefore been thought out. In 1883-4 Charles Lartigue, the eminent French\r\nengineer, developing the principle conceived by the great Telford,\r\nconstructed some small lines in Tunis and Algeria for carrying esparto\r\ngrass. The cars were drawn by animals in a special form of mono-rail,\r\nthe model upon which Mr. F. B. Behr, ASS. INST. C.E.--who modestly\r\ndisclaims all originality in the matter--has worked for years, greatly\r\nimproving in practical details the original design, and constructing for\r\nthe first time mono-rail trains that have been successful in the\r\ncarriage of both goods and passengers by steam and electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. PLAN OF A BEHR MONO-RAILWAY CAR\r\n\r\n_By permission of Mr. F. B. Behr, Ass. Inst. C.E._]\r\n\r\nThe Lartigue single-rail system, as perfected by Mr. Behr, is as\r\nfollows, but of necessity my description is a mere outline.\r\n\r\nDismissing all preconceived ideas of rails laid down upon the ground, we\r\nmust imagine a heavy double-headed steel rail firmly bolted on to the\r\nsummit of a girder supported by trestles, the whole rigidly framed upon\r\nmassive sleepers. We thus have a permanent way somewhat resembling a\r\ncontinuous A-shaped metal viaduct, raised about five feet from the\r\nsurface, or a succession of iron barriers--such as road-menders make\r\nuse of to divert the traffic--set ends on, secured to each other and to\r\nthe ground. Now take an ordinary railway car with seats arranged as in\r\nan omnibus, but with two additional rows back to back in the centre.\r\nRemove the axles and wheels, extending the sides and ends of the car\r\nalmost down to the ground level, thus providing beneath the flooring an\r\nenclosure with ample room for the locomotive machinery. All along the\r\nbottom of this enclosure is an opening or space, about five feet\r\nhigh--extending between the middle rows of seats--that fits the A-shaped\r\nviaduct, so that the car is suspended, or, as it were, sits upon the\r\nmono-rail, whereon roll six vertical grooved wheels that, when set in\r\nmotion by the electric current, propel the cars. Thus we have a train\r\napparently without wheels, these together with the apparatus being\r\ncompletely hidden away between and beneath the passengers’ seats. On\r\neach side of the A-shaped trestle are fixed two guide-rails fitting\r\nclose into horizontal grooved wheels effectually checking all\r\noscillation. In front is the bogie locomotive motor with a pointed bow,\r\nthe stern of the car also being pointed, so that the entire arrangement\r\nresembles when seen from above a great stickless rocket with a sharp and\r\nflexible snout.\r\n\r\nAs the sister isle was the first to adopt electricity to a railway\r\n(_vide_ Chapter II.), so was she the pioneer of mono-railism. In County\r\nKerry, Munster, near the Shannon’s mouth, stands the little town of\r\nListowel, and 9½ miles distant is Ballybunion. To connect these a\r\nmono-railway for passenger and goods traffic was opened on March 1st,\r\n1888, and has worked ever since without any difficulty. The trains are\r\ndrawn by a steam locomotive divided in two, one on each side of the\r\nmono-rail--a kind of twin-screw arrangement--and with their smoke-stacks\r\nand giant lantern between them, present a strange and rather comical\r\nappearance, while the track meandering at its own sweet will across\r\ncountry without fencing of any kind, adds to the novelty of the little\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIts great safety has been amply demonstrated by the only mishap that has\r\noccurred to it. Some miscreant had deliberately removed the fastenings\r\nfrom over thirty yards of the line at a critical point where a reverse\r\ncurve began, and close to a bridge. At full speed, a train carrying 200\r\npassengers came up to the loosened rail, which gave way, breaking the\r\ncoupling chains and, luckily, bringing into action the automatic\r\nWestinghouse brake. The permanent way was ruined by the shock, but the\r\nfall absorbed the force of the reaction, and deposited the carriages\r\nquietly on the ground without injury to anyone, and without even\r\nbreaking a window. On an ordinary line the train would have been thrown\r\noff the metals into the river with terrible consequences. Shortly after\r\nthe line was opened, the Lartigue system was adopted in France, from\r\nTours to Pannissieres in the Loire Department.\r\n\r\nThe Ballybunion and Listowel Railway is the indirect father of a\r\nmodified form of mono-rail which is expected to appear this year at the\r\nCrystal Palace. It is called the Electric Mid-Railway, the invention of\r\nMr. W. R. Smith, and as the line is to connect the existing railway\r\nstation with various points in the grounds, it should be well patronised\r\nat the modest penny fare which is to be charged. Being an entire\r\nnovelty, it has a specially good chance of success in this particular\r\nsituation. The single rail is placed below the carriage, the weight of\r\nwhich is balanced upon it after the fashion of a bicycle. On each side\r\nof this single track runs a trestle carrying a rail on a level with the\r\ncentre of gravity of each carriage. This rail serves the necessary\r\npurpose of supporting the carriage and of also preventing derailing.\r\n\r\nA similar device had been suggested--and possibly has been carried into\r\neffect on the New York and Washington D. C. Line--when it was proposed\r\nto elevate a track above the earth on a single line of upright beams,\r\nthe trains to be kept steady by an auxiliary rail on either side, but\r\nwhich would only come into play on rounding curves.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH-SPEED ELECTRIC RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, Mr. Behr, who throughout his labours there received the\r\npersonal encouragement and patronage of King Leopold II., successfully\r\nbuilt an experimental high-speed mono-rail line at Tervueren in the\r\nneighbourhood of Brussels, as an annexe to the Exhibition of 1897. To\r\nfind suitable ground was the great difficulty. The line had to cross ten\r\npublic roads, and in the absence of compulsory powers, leases for the\r\nland had to be arranged with grasping occupiers and owners. The soil was\r\nbad, big cuttings and embankment were unavoidable, and finally the line\r\nconsisted of nothing but steep, up-and-down gradients. In fact, all the\r\nconditions were most unfavourable, notwithstanding which, the result of\r\nthe experiment was conclusive in showing that with the mono-rail and\r\nperfected electrical traction, very high speed, double that of existing\r\npassenger express trains, could be attained with absolute safety, a\r\nprinciple which Mr. Behr had for a long time past been particularly\r\nimpressed with, but which he maintains is not possible on the ordinary\r\ntwo-rail track, even with electricity as a motive power.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1901, Mr. Behr went to Berlin, and investigated the\r\nexperiments carried out during forty days by a number of engineering\r\nexperts on a military track laid down between the German capital and\r\nZossen. It was hoped that a speed of 160 miles an hour would be attained\r\nand maintained, and, as a matter of fact, starting from a low speed, the\r\ntrain gradually reached that of 87 miles; then, for a moment only, 95\r\nmiles; and for an instant of time, 100 miles per hour; but it was at\r\nonce discernible that the ordinary two-rail permanent way, though\r\nstraight, could not bear the terrific strain imposed upon it; the rails\r\nbent at many places, while the hundred-miles-an-hour rate had so\r\ndestructive an effect as to render impracticable any attempt to create a\r\nhigher record. The air resistance was found to be considerable. With a\r\nsquare-fronted instead of a pointed coach, it was appreciable, and the\r\nsuction behind the train resembled the pressure of the water at the\r\nstern of a mail steamer, and was calculated to equal two-thirds of the\r\n“bow” resistance. These experiments went to prove that for excessive\r\nvelocity an ordinary railway was absolutely unsafe.\r\n\r\nA year before this, a steam locomotive train had been tried in America\r\nby the Baltimore and Ohio Railway Company, on the Adams principle of\r\nreducing the atmospheric resistance to a minimum. It consisted of six\r\ncars, a tender, and an engine of fifty-seven tons. The entire train was\r\nsheathed down to within eight inches of the track. There were no\r\nprojections, and all the windows were flush; the cars were coupled close\r\ntogether, and the rear one was run off to a point, the train resembling\r\none long sinuous and flexible carriage.\r\n\r\nWith this comparatively light engine it is said that the forty miles\r\nbetween Baltimore and Washington were covered in thirty-seven and a half\r\nminutes. But it was claimed that with a more powerful locomotive the\r\ntrain could have been easily run at the rate of one mile in thirty-five\r\nseconds, or nearly two miles a minute.\r\n\r\nThese speeds appear tremendous, but custom would soon reconcile us to\r\nthem. Our forefathers thought fifteen miles an hour terrific; and one of\r\nthe objections to Stephenson’s ideas was, that at such a speed, not to\r\nmention a twenty-or twenty-five-mile rate, no human being could draw\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nSince then we have quietly acquiesced in and equally welcomed a style of\r\ntravelling varying from 35 to an average of 58 miles an hour, and even\r\nconsider it no great feat to run a special viceregal train from Euston\r\nto Holyhead--263½ miles--in five hours without stopping, and are not\r\nastonished to read of last year’s record run of the mail express from\r\nBoulogne to Paris--168 miles--at an average speed of 68 miles an hour!\r\n\r\nStill, 120 miles every sixty minutes without stopping is a large order,\r\nand in practice would give some remarkable results. For instance, a\r\nresident at Putney could be whisked from the station nearest to him, and\r\nthence to a point adjoining his office--say in Seething Lane, some seven\r\nmiles off--in less than five minutes. Brighton could be reached from\r\ntown in twenty-five minutes; Dover, in forty; Edinburgh, in three hours\r\ntwenty minutes. Inverness--663 miles away--could be arrived at from\r\nEuston in six hours twenty minutes, instead of the fifteen hours\r\nthirty-five minutes of the ordinary express; and Paris--allowing one\r\nhour thirty minutes for the Channel passage--in three hours forty-two\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANCHESTER AND LIVERPOOL ELECTRIC EXPRESS RAILWAY\r\n\r\nNow, the contention of the advocates of the monorail principle is,\r\nthat only by that system can very high speed be safely attained; and\r\nwhen one comes to closely examine the cars in which this\r\nhundred-and-ten-miles-per-hour travelling is achieved, confidence is at\r\nonce inspired, because of their low centre of gravity and consequent\r\nunlikeliness of derailment.\r\n\r\nThere remains only one question--_Cui bono?_ What useful purpose can be\r\nserved by being able to get from Liverpool to Manchester in twenty\r\nminutes instead of over an hour? On an emergency, such as a sudden\r\nnecessity for the services of a medical specialist, a matter of life or\r\ndeath perhaps, or on the occasion of any crisis in domestic or\r\nmercantile life when the instant presence of some one distant individual\r\nis imperative, it might be of immense service. But in the usual course\r\nof business, do not existing railways bring merchant and broker,\r\nimporter and manufacturer, face to face quickly enough, and are not\r\ntelephones and telegraphs and the post sufficient to carry through big\r\ntransactions between the centre of the cotton trade and the great city\r\non the banks of the Mersey? Public opinion, which demands increasing\r\nspeed in every phase of life, especially in travelling, declares they\r\nare not sufficient; for we live in an impatient age when every hour of\r\ndetention on a transatlantic passage is begrudged.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is not to be wondered at that in 1900-1, after the most\r\nexhaustive inquiries and criticisms, the royal assent was given August\r\n17th, 1901, to the Manchester and Liverpool Electric Express Railway,\r\nwhich was duly authorised by Act of Parliament. It must be premised that\r\nthe line, like our London Tube, does not provide for goods traffic; that\r\nthe time occupied by the journey being so short, neither luggage-van,\r\nlavatory, or refreshment buffet is required, and that all trains consist\r\nof a single car, couplings being a source of danger at so great a rate\r\nof speed. But as the trains run every ten minutes, and carry about forty\r\npersons each time, a large passenger traffic is provided for.\r\n\r\nWell--a broker has been telephoned for by his client, a wealthy\r\ncotton-spinner in Manchester, anxious to consult with him personally; so\r\nhe at once leaves the flags of the Exchange, and after an eight minutes’\r\nwalk arrives at the Express Railway Station, near the entrance gate of\r\nthe Blue Coat Hospital in School Lane. He considers that in getting into\r\nand out of the lift he has lost two minutes, but he just catches his car\r\nand starts for a run of 34½ miles to Manchester, and since it is his\r\nfirst experience of lightning travelling, he notices everything\r\nconnected with the new line. There are many curves, he finds, all\r\nnecessary in order to avoid conflict with the vested interests of other\r\nrailway companies; the gradients, he observes, at points about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile from the Liverpool and Manchester stations, are\r\nsteep--1 in 25, and 1 in 30--but of service in accelerating and breaking\r\nthe trains.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Listowel mono-rail line, the Manchester and Liverpool express\r\nis fenced from end to end with an unclimbable barrier, and as there are\r\nno level-crossings and no means of access, there is no possibility of\r\ntrespassing. Also, for the security of the workmen employed in\r\nmaintaining the track as on an ordinary railway--the system of “packing”\r\nthe sleepers and inspecting the various parts being common to all\r\nrailways--a clear space of three feet is left between the passing\r\ntrains, and strong posts, ten feet apart, are fixed along the centre of\r\nthe space for the labourers to hold on by when an express rushes by.\r\nCollisions, our broker quickly perceives, are impossible, there being no\r\nswitches, and notwithstanding the multitude of passengers (some twenty\r\nthousand per day) there are never more than two cars on the line at a\r\ntime, and there are no stoppages between the two termini.\r\n\r\nFor signalling purposes, the line is divided into four sections of about\r\nfive miles each, and as the train passes by, its electric motor\r\nautomatically operates the signal and immediately “blocks” the section\r\nbehind it, so that the train following cannot advance until its leader\r\nhas cleared the five-mile division.\r\n\r\nThe driver and conductor are both together in the front part of the\r\ntrain, so that the conductor has ample time to look out for the signals,\r\nto apply the brakes, and assist his mate. The brakes are of the\r\nWestinghouse pattern, and the two combined can stop the cars in about\r\n800 yards, even at the speed of 110 miles an hour. These can be aided by\r\nMr. Behr’s ingenious device, which Sir William H. Preece considers quite\r\npracticable, viz. louvres or shutters, which, when opened, materially\r\nincrease the air resistance.\r\n\r\nPast Toxteth Park, Garston, Halewood, Widnes (whose only rival in sheer\r\nugliness is perhaps London’s Stratford-by-Bow), and exactly half-way,\r\nWarrington, conspicuous for the inkiness of its river Mersey, and noted\r\nfor its glass, wire, and chemical industries; famed for its network of\r\nwaterways, especially for the great but evil-smelling ship-canal; noted\r\nin history--when but a hamlet, with a clear trout-yielding stream--as\r\nthe camping-ground of the young Pretender when on his march to Derby in\r\n1745; and associated with Mrs. Gaskell (whose “Cranford” is identified\r\nwith Knutsford, a neighbouring village), the two Bishops Claughton,\r\nViscount Cross, Luke Fildes, R.A., and “Warrington” Wood, the sculptor.\r\n\r\nClose by, in the parish of Great Sankey, is the power-generating\r\nstation of the railway, the current obtained being 15,000 volts on the\r\ntriphase alternating system, converted in five sub-stations placed along\r\nthe line, into a continuous 650 volt current. Every car has four\r\ntraction motors arranged in pairs, each with a full-speed capacity of\r\n160 h.p., equal to 110 miles an hour. The cars are comfortably\r\nupholstered; the seats are separated and placed back to back in the\r\nmiddle, those along the sides facing inwards, as in the Twopenny Tube.\r\nThe lighting is, of course, excellent, and the ventilation perfect,\r\nthough to prevent accident the windows are fixed, and the doors, while\r\nthe train is in motion, are automatically locked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. INTERIOR OF A BEHR MONO-RAILWAY CAR\r\n\r\n_By permission of_ _Mr. F. B. Behr, Ass. Inst. C. E._]\r\n\r\nAs regards the cost of this novel undertaking, our Liverpool friend had\r\nbeforehand ascertained that the capital had been fixed at £2,800,000,\r\nand that an average of eight persons per train would more than cover the\r\nexpense of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nSwiftly leaving Warrington in the distance, the express shoots\r\nonwards--past Eccles, Pendleton, and Salford--and reaches the terminus\r\nat the west side of Deansgate, in the busiest part of Cottonopolis,\r\nwhere, again using the lift, our honest broker speeds to the Exchange in\r\nanother eight minutes, and in forty-five minutes after leaving Liverpool\r\nis in deep business conference with his principal at Manchester.\r\n\r\nContrast this with the existing facilities of the old system for rapid\r\ntransit between the two places; and those who know their Manchester and\r\nLiverpool well, will at once be able to decide whether or not the\r\nelectric express better meets the requirements of those to whom every\r\nminute is of consequence.\r\n\r\nThe London and North Western Railway (which has a perfectly straight bit\r\nof track to Manchester, unequalled, except on the Great Eastern between\r\nLittleford and Lynn--21 miles--and on the South Eastern between Nutfield\r\nand Ashford--32 miles) runs expresses without stopping from Lime Street\r\nand Edge Hill to the Exchange Station, Manchester, doing the journey in\r\nforty minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Great Central Railway, by an indirect route, _viâ_ Garston and\r\nWidnes, runs expresses from their Liverpool station (St. James’s) direct\r\nto the Manchester Central, in from forty to forty-five minutes; but on\r\nneither line is there such a thing as a ten minutes’ service, the\r\nintervals between the direct expresses ranging from forty-five minutes\r\nto so much as four hours.\r\n\r\nPlans, it is said, have been submitted to the Board of Trade for a\r\nmono-railway between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The proposed construction is\r\nsimilar to that of the Behr mono-railway between Liverpool and\r\nManchester. It is quite unlike the canny Scot to rush into sensational\r\nexperiments for a speed of 117 miles per hour, especially as a few\r\nyears’ waiting for the completion of the Liverpool line would prove or\r\ndisprove the possibility of the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_REJUVENATING THE METROPOLITAN INNER CIRCLE_\r\n\r\n“So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.”--Ps. ciii. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE METROPOLITAN AND METROPOLITAN DISTRICT RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nCan anything be satisfactorily rejuvenated? Is there any truth in the\r\nMedean story that old age can revert to the vigour of young manhood?\r\n\r\nIn 1903 the usual reply is “No.” If a theatre becomes dilapidated, it is\r\npulled down. If a railway-station gets much out of repair, the company\r\nproceeds to reconstruct, and not to patch up. If a macadamised\r\nthoroughfare gives signs of too much wear and tear, it is broken up and\r\nrelaid with wood blocks.\r\n\r\nIn fact, rejuvenation on a large scale is so seldom attempted that the\r\nscheme for renovating and electrifying the Inner Circle Railway may be\r\nregarded as something remarkable.\r\n\r\nFor convenience we will call it the Inner Circle, but, as we all know,\r\nit is a dual concern controlled by the Metropolitan and the Metropolitan\r\nDistrict, both of them old enough to have a respectable history.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago railways within the boundaries of Inner London were\r\nnon-existent, the nearest points approached by the country lines being\r\nat Battersea, Euston, St. Pancras, Shoreditch, Paddington, London\r\nBridge, and Waterloo--miles away from the central districts.\r\n\r\nIt was an ideal time for omnibus companies, who charged pretty well what\r\nthey liked: and for cabmen, whose fare was nominally restricted to\r\neightpence a mile, but who were masters of the situation when passengers\r\nwith luggage had to be conveyed from the termini. Yet, although many\r\nsuggestions were made, including that of a great central station where\r\nall the lines might converge, the travelling world was considerably\r\nstartled in 1854 by a proposition laid before Parliament to construct an\r\nunderground line from Farringdon Street to Bishop’s Road, Paddington;\r\nand so astonished were capitalists that although the bill passed, the\r\nmoney was so slow in coming in that work could not be begun until six\r\nyears later!\r\n\r\nIn planning the route a golden opportunity was lost of anticipating the\r\nTwopenny Tube; but the opposition of Oxford Street was so fierce that\r\nthe line had to be poked away beneath the Marylebone Road in the\r\nnorth-west of London, convenient for residents in Paddington and\r\nBayswater, but useless to other districts, and, what was more important,\r\nit did not go to the Bank, the centre of the business world.\r\n\r\nHowever, we, then as now, were but a slow people, therefore really\r\ncomprehensive schemes found little favour in the “fifties” and\r\n“sixties.” For three years the Marylebone and Euston roads were closed\r\nto traffic, and presented the appearance of a besieged city’s outskirts\r\nwhere deep trenches and fortifications were being made. The roadway was\r\nremoved to a great depth; pipes and sewers were taken away and replaced;\r\nfoundations were underpinned, and a series of solid brick tunnels were\r\nslowly and laboriously constructed and covered up. The plank pathways,\r\nthe noise, and the smells, drove householders along the route to\r\ndesperation; and, on nearing the City, the problem of dealing with the\r\nold Fleet Ditch was at one period thought insoluble. No wonder that,\r\nwhat with compensation to owners of damaged property, the acquisition of\r\nnecessary land, and engineering difficulties, the cost of the line at\r\nsome points mounted up to a million sterling per mile!\r\n\r\nAt last the first section was completed; and in September, 1862, a trial\r\ntrip was made. A contemporary picture represents the train passing\r\nPortland Road Station, its open trucks in the rear full of enthusiastic\r\nguests waving flags and tall hats--after luncheon probably--evidently\r\ndelighted with the success of the undertaking. But at the formal\r\nopening, January 9th, 1863, a grand banquet was given in the Farringdon\r\nStreet Station, three long tables occupying the rail and platform space,\r\nwith a [ shaped table on a daïs for the principal guests.\r\n\r\nThe following day thirty thousand passengers journeyed over the line,\r\nand everybody in London talked about the Underground as somewhat of a\r\nmarvel. But people exhibited strange ignorance on the subject, nervous\r\npeople preparing for wonderful possibilities, imagining that the cellars\r\nwould collapse as the trains thundered by, or that the houses would\r\ntumble through on to the line, flinging their occupants before some\r\npassing engine!\r\n\r\nYet, after all, the Underground was only an ordinary tunnel (such as\r\npierce a score of hills), placed in an exceptional position in the midst\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nBit by bit, as years went by, the Metropolitan Railway extended itself\r\neastward and westward to High Street, Kensington, whence the District\r\nRailway that had sprung into existence went ahead and got as far as\r\nWestminster, its line being partly open and partly tunnelled. There the\r\nDistrict stuck for three years, and then found its way into the City (a\r\ngreat boon as an alternative route). At the Mansion House Station it\r\nseemed determined to rest for a long period; the Metropolitan showing\r\nthe same propensity at the Moorgate Street sheds, until City men began\r\nto give up all hope of the two ends ever meeting.\r\n\r\nIt came about at last, however, and the year 1884 witnessed the\r\ncompletion of the irregular Inner Circle--a total length of about 12½\r\nmiles--by way of Bishopsgate, Aldgate, Mark Lane, the Monument, and\r\nCannon Street, without any serious disturbance of the traffic, but with\r\nmuch wonderful underpinning of warehouses and offices (a notable\r\ninstance of this operation being beneath King William the Fourth’s\r\nstatue, which weighs over 250 tons!).\r\n\r\nAt first there were no smoking-carriages, but the numerous complaints on\r\nthe subject induced the directors to alter their rules, and they went to\r\nthe other extreme, so that now non-smokers think there seem to be more\r\nsmoking-carriages than any others.\r\n\r\nIn its young days the Metropolitan was clean and its atmosphere\r\ntolerable. In fact, it had been proposed to use smokeless engines, but\r\nfor some reason the idea was abandoned, and, as the main railway lines\r\nbegan to send out feelers towards the inner districts of London, they\r\nsought for, and obtained, running powers over the Underground, junctions\r\nbeing made with the Great Northern Railway and Great Western, the London\r\nand North Western, and the Midland. Consequently, the number of trains\r\nimmensely increased, and the smoke nuisance was intensified. Ventilating\r\nshafts were adopted, and afforded some relief, but the imprisoned fog of\r\nwinter precipitated the “blacks,” and summer weather only made the\r\natmosphere still more stifling; while Baker Street, Gower Street, and\r\nKing’s Cross stations and tunnels were positive infernos, and for how\r\nmany deaths from asthma and bronchitis they were responsible no one\r\nknows!\r\n\r\nThe rolling-stock of the Metropolitan became dirtier and dirtier, grime\r\nand disfigurement settled down upon it, and everybody’s experience of it\r\nresembled that of Mrs. Lilian Rosamond, described in Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW DISTRICT RAILWAY\r\n\r\nJust opposite St. Mark’s College, Chelsea, is a narrow thoroughfare\r\ncalled Lot’s Road, leading to a creek that separates the Borough from\r\nFulham. Tradition says that the locality was formerly known as “The\r\nLots” (about four acres in extent), and was granted to a Sir Arthur\r\nGorges by the lord of the manor, in lieu of certain rights over land\r\nwhich he gave up for the formation of the Kensington Canal; but\r\nincredulous old folk dismissed this tradition with contempt, and\r\nmaintained that there was a Chelsea personage named Lot, very distantly\r\nrelated to the patriarch’s nephew, who pitched his tent in the fertile\r\nJordan Valley, and that the dismal Chelsea wastes so much resembled the\r\ndesolateness of the fatal plains, that diligent search therein might\r\neven result in the discovery of the Pillar of Salt, brought over to this\r\ncountry at some remote period by a pious descendant! But whoever, or\r\nwhatever, the name Lot may represent, it is now associated with one of\r\nthe greatest electrical undertakings of the age--the huge generating\r\nstation of the Underground Electric Railway Company of London, Limited,\r\nwho, as at present arranged, will supply the District and other railways\r\nwith power.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of Lot’s Road, and at a point on the Middlesex bank of\r\nBattersea Reach, facing the ugly parish church of St. Mary, is the\r\nmouth of Chelsea Creek, filled twice a day by the muddy waters of the\r\nThames, and here the Electrical Works are being erected. They are in\r\nsight of an obscure cottage in Cheyne Walk where the painter Turner\r\nlived in concealment, and where he died. The building, with its four\r\ngreat chimney-shafts, is unæsthetic to a degree, and Turner would\r\nprobably have thought it ruined his favourite landscape. But it\r\nrepresents something more valuable than æsthetic effect.\r\n\r\nWhen Matthew Doulton, in the infancy of steam, took the Russian Prince\r\nPotemkin round the works at Soho, Manchester, the distinguished visitor\r\ninquired, “What do you sell here?” “We make and sell here,” replied\r\nJames Watts’ partner, “that which all the world wants--_Power_.” And\r\nthis, on a scale undreamt of by the famous engineer, is what the\r\nUnderground Electric Railway Company of London will produce, in view of\r\nthe river scenery so much admired by the chief of impressionists, and\r\nwhich he never wearied of depicting.\r\n\r\nThis temple of electric force will be the largest in the Old World. In\r\nNew York, the Manhattan and the Metropolitan companies both have power\r\nstations slightly smaller. The Rapid Transit Commission have projected\r\none that will be bigger, while the Waterside station of the Edison\r\nIlluminating Company (partially completed) is on a still larger scale.\r\nIt has, however, been stated that the biggest power scheme on earth will\r\nbe at Massena, on the St. Lawrence River, Canada, where there will be\r\nfifteen Westinghouse machines, equal to a total of 75,000 kilowatts.\r\n\r\nWithin the temple there will be turbo-generators fifty feet in length\r\nand ten feet high, constructed by the British Westinghouse Company at\r\ntheir Trafford Park\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. ELECTRICAL POWER HOUSE (THE LARGEST IN THE OLD\r\nWORLD) LOT’S ROAD, CHELSEA, TO SUPPLY THE METROPOLITAN DISTRICT AND\r\nOTHER RAILWAYS WITH CURRENT\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Underground Electric Railways Co. of London,\r\nLtd._]\r\n\r\nWorks, Manchester, capable of producing the prodigious quantity of\r\n60,000 electrical kilowatts, at a pressure, or force, technically\r\nspeaking, of 11,000 volts. In other words, about 100,000 horse-power\r\ncould be sent out, theoretically equal to the lifting of over 1,000,000\r\ntons a foot high every minute.[3] Six such power stations could,\r\ntherefore, move the great pyramid of Cheops (over 6,000,000 tons\r\nweight), and carry it bodily off on colossal rails, and dump it down\r\nanywhere to order.\r\n\r\nFor condensing purposes, an enormous quantity of water will be required,\r\nand every twenty-four hours 19,000,000 gallons of water (at times\r\nmounting up to 40,000,000 gallons) will be drawn from the creek for use\r\nin the power house.\r\n\r\nThe force of 11,000 volts will be much too powerful for direct\r\napplication to the purposes of locomotion. It requires reducing by\r\ntransformers and rotary converters into the safe and ordinary current of\r\nabout 550 volts, which will be effected at sub-stations--Earl’s Court,\r\nSouth Kensington, Victoria, Charing Cross, Mansion House, and other\r\nplaces along the line. To these the current will be sent from the power\r\nhouse, and reduced by the transformers into ordinary low-pressure\r\nvoltage, and the fiery O.P. spirit tamed to a pleasant and portable\r\n“under-proof” standard! The current will then be distributed to two\r\nconductor-rails, one located between the present running rails, and the\r\nother outside them. The motors on the trains will receive the current\r\nfrom one rail by means of a sliding contact-shoe, and return it to the\r\nother rail in the same manner. In passing through the motor the\r\nelectricity causes the armature to revolve, which motion, by means of\r\ngearing, is communicated to the carriage axle.\r\n\r\nSo much for the driving-power of the trains. But what kind of trains do\r\nthe public expect?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. A 2,000 H.P. WESTINGHOUSE STEAM TURBINE,\r\nRESEMBLING THE TURBO-GENERATORS (EACH OF 7,500 H.P.) IN THE CHELSEA\r\nPOWER HOUSE.\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Westinghouse Companies, Ltd., London_]\r\n\r\nSurely not the old carriages cleaned up and re-upholstered--made “to\r\nlast a little longer,” until broken up for firewood and old iron. The\r\npublic will not be disappointed in the new cars, nothing as yet having\r\nbeen seen in London to equal them.\r\n\r\nThe trains will be run on the principle of the multiple unit. That is,\r\neach will be made up of seven coaches--three long motor-cars and four\r\ntrail-cars--with a motor-man’s cab at each end, and one in the centre.\r\nThese eight-wheeled coaches will be rectangular at the sides--not\r\nsloping like those of the Waterloo Tube Company--and very roomy, 52\r\nfeet long and about 8 feet 2 inches wide inside, and about 8 feet 7\r\ninches from the floor to the middle of the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. A NEW METROPOLITAN DISTRICT RAILWAY CAR\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Underground Electric Railways Co. of London,\r\nLtd._]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the seats will be somewhat different from that of the\r\nTube. There will, of course, be corridor cars, which will be entered\r\nfrom the platforms, through telescopic doors; there will be also sliding\r\ndoors. The gain in leg-space will be great, the centre gangway giving a\r\nclear 4 feet, and there will be fewer cross seats. Each train will hold\r\nabout 338 passengers; the ventilation of the cars will be perfect; and\r\nthe height sufficient for a giant. As the District tunnels are 25 feet\r\nin diameter, and 15 feet 9 inches from the rail level to the crown of\r\nthe arch, there will be about 2 feet of head-room, about 2 feet 6 inches\r\nbetween each train, and the same between the trains and the sides of the\r\ntunnels.\r\n\r\nCompare this with the present Inner Circle trains that carry about three\r\nhundred passengers, with gangways that, even in the first-class\r\ncompartments, leave no room for incomers to avoid a leg entanglement,\r\nand whose height will hardly admit a tall man in a tall hat to stand\r\nupright. Also compare it with the dimensions of the Central’s cars,\r\nwhich are 39 feet long, 8 feet wide, and whose height to the middle of\r\nroof is only 7 feet 5 inches, the gangway narrow, with seats in each car\r\nfor forty-eight people. The space in the cars of the City and South\r\nLondon, and the Waterloo and City, is still more exiguous.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to run about twice as many trains as at present, each\r\njourney to be made in about two-thirds of the time now required; that is\r\nto say, the trains that now run about ten miles an hour will, it is\r\nanticipated, work up to at least fifteen miles; the total carrying\r\ncapacity being estimated at 70,000,000 per annum, increasable, if\r\nnecessary, to 100,000,000. There may be an all-night service, for the\r\nconvenience of people engaged at Covent Garden market, and for\r\njournalists and others whose work lies in the vicinity of Fleet Street.\r\nA somewhat novel and economical feature will be that the trains, during\r\nthe stock hours of the day, can be run in short lengths, as in the City\r\nand Waterloo Railway, and, with their triple motors divided, will\r\nresemble those strange Naidæ worms of the Annelida class that possess\r\nthe power of increasing by mechanical division. They will also be able\r\nto go forward and backward without reversing the motor engines.\r\n\r\nBrilliant will be the lighting of the cars and stations; the tunnels,\r\ntoo, are to be illuminated. Fresh air will be obtained by the frequent\r\nmovements of the trains through the tunnels, while smoke and smuts will,\r\nof course, become things of the past. The stations, with their wide and\r\nroomy platforms, will in some cases be lengthened by fifty feet to\r\naccommodate the three-hundred-and-fifty-feet-long trains, and be\r\nthoroughly cleansed and repainted, and the tunnels may possibly be\r\nwhitened by means of “spraying”--the principle adopted at the Chicago\r\nExhibition for the finials of the pavilions.\r\n\r\nThe question of classes, fares, and tickets has not yet been settled,\r\nbut we may assume that the system adopted will be somewhat like that of\r\nthe Tube. The entire project closely resembles the Metropolitan\r\nUnderground Railway of Paris, and the Boston Subway. Lifts are not at\r\npresent contemplated, and probably their absence will be no great loss\r\nto active travellers, nor even to the “old, subdued, and slow,” for\r\ntrains will so quickly succeed one another that the missing of one will\r\ninvolve no serious delay. Possibly, however, as time goes on, some new\r\nand convenient form of sloping footway may be adopted.\r\n\r\nBut alas! for the lovers of the beautiful, the directors, we are told,\r\n“have not decided that they will be warranted in sacrificing, on\r\næsthetic grounds, the revenue derived from advertisements.”\r\n\r\nThen, again, as there will be little or no waiting, even the most\r\nimpatient of _voyageurs_ will hardly need the diversion obtained by a\r\ntrial of the omnipresent penny-in-the-slot machines, or the\r\ncontemplation of the numerous works of art displayed on the station\r\nwalls. They will not even need the bookstalls, much less to gape at the\r\ncontents-bills of the daily paper.\r\n\r\nAnd, provided the glass roofs be kept clean, and the atmosphere innocent\r\nof smoke and gas, might not the stations--sheltered as they are from the\r\nvagaries of weather, and brilliantly lighted--be transformed into\r\nmodified winter gardens, with sturdy flowers and shrubs filling up nooks\r\nand corners, and bold paintings (frequently renewed) of distant lands,\r\nseascapes, and historical subjects, in the recesses now covered by\r\n“Reckitt’s Blue,” etc.? The frequent stopping of trains would be\r\nactually welcomed, and people would travel by the “Circle” for the sake\r\nof seeing the novelties! In fact, every station might be converted into\r\na thing of beauty.\r\n\r\nOne other suggestion for the directors of the new Inner Circle. Cannot\r\nsomething be contrived in the new cars to effectually deaden the sound\r\nof the closing and opening of doors, so irritating to modern nerves, and\r\nunpleasantly associated with the “banging” in the old carriages, and the\r\n“clashing” of the telescopics in the Tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW METROPOLITAN RAILWAY\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Railway will be electrified in a very similar manner to\r\nthe District Railway, the system being the same, _i.e._ alternating\r\nthree-phase, converted at sub-stations into continuous current. Access\r\nto the platforms will be by short staircases, and not by lifts. It is\r\nsaid that when steam is abolished the appearance of the stations may\r\npossibly be improved, but the advertisements are too important a source\r\nof revenue to be removed, and, as the Company says, “they act as a\r\nrelief to the bare walls, and their withdrawal would answer no good”! An\r\neffort will be made to cleanse the tunnels, but it has not yet been\r\ndecided what method will be adopted.\r\n\r\nThere exist an abundance of open spaces, ventilating-shafts, and holes,\r\nand the frequent passing of trains in contrary directions will\r\nnecessarily keep the air in motion, and thus, as in the District, the\r\nproblem of ventilation will solve itself.\r\n\r\nThe cars will be of the corridor type, seven to a full train, each end\r\ncar and the middle one having a motor, and if the contingencies of the\r\ntraffic do not require a large train, it will thus be possible to divide\r\nit and run it in two parts. The seating will be both transverse and\r\nlongitudinal, and considerably over four hundred passengers it is said\r\ncan be accommodated in each full train. As to day and night services,\r\ntheir frequency, the fares, and the distinction of classes, nothing has\r\nyet been decided.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from Wembly, where “Watkins’ Folly,” as it is locally\r\ncalled--at one time aspiring, like Babel’s, to “reach unto\r\nheaven”--shows gauntly against the skyline its first stage of only 150\r\nfeet, is Neasden, where, on land belonging to the Metropolitan Railway,\r\nis being erected its power house (the most extensive in the kingdom\r\nowned by a single railway company), capable of producing some 14,000\r\nkilowatts. Water in abundance will be obtained by means of artesian\r\nwells now being bored in the chalk; and coal can be readily supplied.\r\nThe current will be applied to cars, as on the District, by a\r\nconductor-rail placed in the near side of the permanent way, with a\r\nreturn fixed in the centre of the running track. By the end of 1903 it\r\nis hoped that the work will be sufficiently advanced for some trains to\r\nbe run by electricity. Finally, as the Metropolitan’s engineer-in-chief\r\nremarks, there will be no marked novelties, but “the very conversion\r\nfrom steam to electric traction will prove a great novelty and an\r\nattraction. New cars of the latest type will be introduced, the stations\r\nwill be bright and cheerful, the atmosphere pure; travel will be\r\nundertaken with a greater degree of comfort, and freedom from\r\ndisagreeable odours. In short, nothing that can reasonably be expected\r\nto be performed in the interests of the public will be left undone.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN CAPITAL\r\n\r\nA good deal has been said in reference to the source whence the\r\nnecessary capital has been obtained for rejuvenating the Inner Circle,\r\npatriotic people objecting to the so-called Americanising of this great\r\nundertaking, though it is hardly a logical objection.\r\n\r\nIf British capitalists are lacking in enterprise, there is no reason why\r\nLondon should wait until they evince it. The world will not go to sleep\r\nwhile Lombard Street hesitates. As Mr. Perks, M.P., Chairman of the\r\nDistrict Company has said, out of the five millions sterling invested in\r\nthe new Underground Electric Railway Companies of London, Limited, less\r\nthan two millions were held in America, and three millions on this side\r\nthe Atlantic. “I do not care,” he said, “where the money comes from, so\r\nlong as it is good money”--a wise remark, like the _non olet_ of\r\nSuetonius. What matters it whence the materials of a sovereign have\r\ncome? They cannot be ear-marked, and whether its gold is Brazilian,\r\nAustralian, South African, or American, is of no consequence. It is a\r\nlegal tender, and worth twenty silver shillings.\r\n\r\nAnother matter that has engaged public attention is the apparent\r\ndifference of opinion between the Metropolitan and the Metropolitan\r\nDistrict Companies, as to the control of the Inner Circle. Nature has\r\ndesigned them to be one, and but for vested and promoters’ interests,\r\nthey probably would have been one from the first. They are not merely\r\nbrother and sister, but are united by a closer tie, therefore their\r\nmotto surely ought to be _Quis separabit_!\r\n\r\nLet us hope that long before the scheme is completed there will be a\r\nreconciliation, and a satisfactory working arrangement made “out of\r\ncourt” between these two parties to an unnecessary divorce suit.\r\n\r\nThe two lines have carried their millions of passengers, and the\r\nrejuvenated Inner Circle during its new and beneficent career is\r\ndestined to carry very many millions more, and prove a great boon to the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_THE CENTRAL LONDON ELECTRIC RAILWAY_\r\n\r\n“Tell by what paths, what subterranean ways.”--BLACKMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE RAILWAY AND ITS CITY SUBWAYS\r\n\r\nWhen those electric traction pioneers, the City and South London, and\r\nthe Waterloo and City Railways, were opened respectively in 1890 and\r\n1898, they were regarded by the public with a certain amount of apathy.\r\nBut when, in July, 1900, the Central London Railway, inaugurated by the\r\nPrince of Wales, was opened for traffic, and it was realised that the\r\nline was laid literally in the centre of London, beneath one of the\r\ngreatest street routes in existence, viz. Cheapside, Newgate Street,\r\nHolborn, Oxford Street, Bayswater and Uxbridge roads, and was capable of\r\ndealing with a gigantic stream of passengers at a uniform fare for any\r\ndistance, it arrested universal attention, and for a time nothing was\r\ntalked about but the deep-level system for metropolitan railways; and by\r\ngeneral approbation the Central was forthwith dubbed “The Twopenny\r\nTube,” a name it will always retain.\r\n\r\nLike most great enterprises, the Tube Railway had to contend against\r\nconsiderable opposition before legislative sanction could be obtained\r\nfor its construction. It was incorporated on August 5th, 1891, after a\r\ngreat battle with Parliament and local authorities, in which affray the\r\nlate Mr. J. H. Greathead, M. INST. C. E. (deviser of one of the methods\r\nof shield-excavating for driving tunnels), took a conspicuous part, and\r\nthe principle of a “free-way-leave” beneath the streets was successfully\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\nThe original directors were Mr. Henry Tennant (at one time General\r\nManager of the North Eastern Railway Company), Lord Colville of Culross\r\n(Director of the Great Eastern Railway Company), Sir Francis Knollys\r\n(Director of the Great Northern Railway Company), the Hon. A. H. Mills\r\n(of Glyn, Mills, Currie, and Co.), and the Right Hon. D. R. Plunket\r\n(Director of the North London Railway Company). Thus the railway element\r\nwas strongly represented; the financial to a small but very important\r\nextent, and Court influence by two prominent members of the households\r\nof the Prince and Princess of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Company was authorised to construct a double underground line from\r\nLiverpool Street to Shepherds Bush (about 6½ miles); but the plan was\r\nmodified, and the Bank of England became the City starting-point. In\r\ntheir prospectus the directors modestly predicted an annual passenger\r\ntraffic of some forty-two millions (or seven millions per mile of line);\r\nbut this estimate has been largely exceeded, the average being about\r\nfifty-two millions per annum, or one million per week.\r\n\r\nThe Company’s capital ultimately reached the sum of nearly four millions\r\nsterling, so the line can hardly be called a cheap one in point of\r\nconstruction; for, although the “way-leave” beneath the streets was\r\nfree, land had to be bought for the surface booking-offices, costly\r\nshafts had to be sunk to the requisite depth, and tunnels driven, and\r\nnumerous subterranean stations had to be built. Thus, apart from the\r\ncost of the rolling-stock and installation of a large current-generating\r\nstation, the initial expenses soon mounted up.\r\n\r\nAll the booking-offices and stations are built on one principle, each\r\nwith its great electric lift; but special interest attaches to the City\r\nterminus.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to make use, somehow, of the open space between the\r\nMansion House, the Bank, and the Royal Exchange--an ideal spot for a\r\ncentral railway station. But how was it to be effected? For years the\r\nCivic Fathers had contemplated the construction of subways for the\r\nsafety and convenience of foot-passengers at this, which has been termed\r\nthe busiest--as it is almost the most dangerous--spot in the world,\r\nthough I doubt whether in the year 1903 Piccadilly Circus does not run\r\nit hard.\r\n\r\nThe Central Railway Company approached the Corporation on the subject,\r\nand eventually it was agreed between the parties that the Railway\r\nCompany, in return for being allowed the privilege of constructing their\r\nstation beneath the open space, without payment, should make the public\r\nsubways, and hand them over in perpetuity to the City.\r\n\r\nSo for many months the pavement in front of the Royal Exchange was\r\ndisfigured by a lofty wooden hoarding, which completely concealed a\r\nshaft, wherein some mysterious work was progressing. But beyond this\r\nthere was no outward indication of what was going on below; and,\r\nalthough the entire roadway in front of the Mansion House was being\r\nundermined, the vast traffic continued as usual.\r\n\r\nArranging this station proved to be one of the stiffest bits of\r\nengineering work ever attempted. Drain-pipes were ubiquitous--a perfect\r\ntangle that had to be diverted. There were old disused and\r\nlong-forgotten pipes, electric cables, hydraulic power pipes, pneumatic\r\ntubes, gas and water mains--a maze and wilderness of underground\r\ncommunications. These were all rearranged in a special pipe-tunnel, 14\r\nfeet wide. Then, at a depth of about 20 feet, the booking-office was\r\nbuilt, bit by bit, of steel-work, which had previously been temporarily\r\nput together in a field to ensure its fitting exactly into the\r\nexcavation prepared for its accommodation--an area 145 feet one way and\r\n75 feet the other, its outline being on the curve. Its roof, consisting\r\nof girders supporting steel troughing, was filled up with concrete, and\r\nfinally with asphalte, upon which thousands of people pass daily without\r\nrealising what is below them. Access to the booking-office is gained by\r\nnumerous entrances _viâ_ the public subway: two on the Royal Exchange\r\npavement, two at the bottom of Mansion House Place, one at the Poultry\r\ncorner, and one at Walbrook, one in front of the Safe Deposit City\r\nbuildings, two each at the corners of Princes Street and Cornhill, and\r\none at St. Mary Woolnoth Church. The entire arrangement reminds one of a\r\nmole’s subterranean fortress, with its galleries for entrance and exit\r\nbranching off in various directions.\r\n\r\nThese subways, immense conveniences which should be adopted at every\r\n_rond-point_ in London--though it is a strange fact that _habitués_ of\r\nthe City seldom use them, they being patronised chiefly by the\r\n“work-girl” and by casual visitors to the central “square mile”--are 15\r\nfeet wide and 9 feet high, are lined with glazed brick, and have\r\nelectric-lighted stairways at the above-mentioned places.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RAILWAY\r\n\r\nSome fifty feet below the Bank of England Station are the twin-tunnels\r\nand their platforms, approached by five lift shafts of twenty feet, and\r\none stairway shaft of eighteen feet diameter; at a deeper level still\r\nare the tubes of the City and South London Railway, crossing the City\r\n_en route_ to Islington.\r\n\r\nThese great passenger lifts work with wonderful smoothness (_facile\r\ndescensus Averno est_), and without them no fewer than ninety-three\r\nsteps would have to be painfully descended.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar by this time with the other ten surface stations of\r\nthe Twopenny Tube (at the Post Office, Marble Arch, etc.). They are\r\nnearly all alike, and look as if they were waiting for a substantial and\r\nlofty building to be erected upon them, and have little claim to\r\narchitectural beauty. The platforms, necessarily rather contracted in\r\narea, are clean and bright, owing to the extensive use of opalite tiling\r\nand glazed bricks, ever spotless, and practically indestructible. Each\r\ntrain consists of six eight-wheeled bogie-cars, 45½ feet long, with\r\nwell-upholstered seats, arranged longitudinally and crosswise, for\r\nforty-eight passengers. The lighting is effected by means of eight\r\nsixteen-candle-power incandescent lamps, supplemented by small shaded\r\nelectric lights, excellent for reading by. The windows, of course, do\r\nnot open, but practicable ventilating louvres are arranged above them.\r\nEntrance is obtained at each end of the car, and the telescopic gates\r\nare cleverly and expeditiously manipulated by the attendants. Straps are\r\nplaced along rods on each side of the roof to aid passengers in\r\ntraversing the cars, and above the seats are racks for parcels, etc.\r\n\r\nThe electric locomotives[4] are curious in shape, with the driver’s\r\ncabin in the middle, and a backward and forward slope for the apparatus\r\nlooking like gigantic coal-scuttles back to back. They have eight\r\nwheels, and are fitted with motors, one for each axle. The current is\r\ncollected from a central third rail by means of two cast-iron shoes\r\nwhich rub along it, and is led through an automatic circuit-breaker and\r\nswitched to the controller in the driver’s cabin, thence to the motors,\r\nreturning to the track rails through the wheels. The total weight of a\r\nlocomotive is about forty-four tons, and the average speed is about\r\nfourteen miles an hour, the running time from the Bank to the western\r\nterminus being twenty-four minutes.\r\n\r\nAt Shepherd’s Bush--once, as its name implies, a rural suburban hamlet,\r\nsuggestive of pastoral pursuits, flocks of sheep and lambs, washings and\r\nshearings of fleeces--is the chief power station of the Central,\r\nsub-stations being situated at the General Post Office, Marble Arch,\r\nand Notting Hill Gate.\r\n\r\nThe premises cover sixty-eight acres, with plenty of room for locomotive\r\nand car sheds, shunting tracks, boiler and engine houses, the latter\r\nmost impressive from the size of their six Corliss compound horizontal\r\nengines, each rated at 1,300 horse-power, though, as in so much American\r\nmachinery, the somewhat rough exterior detracts from the appearance,\r\nespecially in the eyes of British engineers, accustomed not only to\r\ninternal mechanical perfection--as in the Central’s engines--but to\r\nnicety of finish throughout. These giants are coupled direct to\r\nThomson-Houston dynamos, with the capacity, if required, of 5,100\r\nkilowatts, or 6,800 indicated horse-power.\r\n\r\nAmongst other contemplated improvements is that of loop-lines between\r\nLiverpool Street and the Bank, which will materially help to accelerate\r\nthe traffic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. A TYPICAL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATOR--TWO DYNAMOS,\r\nEACH OF ABOUT 1,600 H.P.\r\n\r\n_By permission of_ _Dick Kerr and Co., London_]\r\n\r\nSome remarkable results, not very satisfactory to those interested in\r\nvehicular traffic, have arisen from the opening of the Twopenny Tube.\r\nThe standard of travelling has gone up steadily; improvements in ’buses\r\nare constantly demanded (garden seats, spiral spring cushions, etc.)\r\nand--somewhat slowly--conceded. Yet, to quote the words of an omnibus\r\nofficial, “_they (the public) want more!_” And this at a time when fares\r\nhave steadily decreased, and the cost of fodder and maintenance have\r\nseriously increased. Worse still, the Tube’s existence has been keenly\r\nrealised all along the line of its route, ladies especially preferring\r\nto go on a shopping expedition by means of the well-lit Tube than by the\r\nnot over-clean, and decidedly slow and stuffy, omnibus. The London Road\r\nCar Company’s returns along Oxford Street and Holborn showed last year a\r\ndecrease nearly equivalent to the Tube’s increase, and the London\r\nGeneral Omnibus Company’s report for the half-year--December 1st,\r\n1901--was so disappointing, owing to dear forage and decreased passenger\r\ntraffic, that its stock fell at one bound ten points, from 105 to 95--a\r\ngrave depreciation in value.\r\n\r\nThe Tube, during the six months ending December 31st, 1902, carried\r\n22,425,776 passengers, a daily average of 121,879, out of which big\r\ntotal 2,770,854 were workmen at a penny per traveller. On Coronation Day\r\n202,000 people journeyed by the Central.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS VENTILATION\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of its career the Tube’s atmosphere and temperature\r\nwere remarkably sweet and equable, not varying much from 62° either in\r\nsummer or winter. During a spell of hot weather it felt delightfully\r\ncool, and when east winds blew it was warm compared with the atmosphere\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nTrips in the Tube were at one time seriously suggested for the cure of\r\nvarious maladies as a modification of that usual last resource of the\r\nmedical profession, “change of air.”\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of the Tube, however, many fond mothers with little\r\nfaith in the pharmacopœia regarded the Underground as a sanatorium\r\nfor children’s complaints. Tunnel air, they affirmed, was good for\r\ncroup, whooping-cough, and various other ailments. A doctor travelling\r\non the Metropolitan once noticed a woman in the same compartment pull\r\ndown the window upon entering a tunnel and hold outside a child she was\r\ncarrying, so that the youngster might get the full benefit of the foul\r\natmosphere. When the doctor inquired the reason for this extraordinary\r\nperformance, she told him that “tunnel air” had been found to be a\r\ncomplete cure for croup. And only the other day an East End mother was\r\ndiscovered by a guard giving her baby two rounds on the Inner Circle\r\nbecause she had been told by a herbalist and bone-setter that a\r\nsulphurous atmosphere was good for whooping-cough.\r\n\r\nBut the ideal state of things in the Tube did not continue, and\r\naccusations respecting its ventilation began to be whispered about and\r\nfinally proclaimed from the housetops (_vide_ Chapter XIX). However,\r\npractical steps were taken to ensure its efficiency, and at the last\r\nmeeting of shareholders the chairman said that the Company had now a\r\nbetter character for ventilation than any other company in London.\r\n\r\nAt Bond Street Station a powerful fan has been placed at the base of the\r\nlift shaft, which, under ordinary pressure, removes the vitiated\r\natmosphere from the permanent ways, fresh air taking its place at the\r\nvarious halting-places. The fan, forty-eight inches in diameter, and\r\nelectrically driven, displaces 30,000 cubic feet of air per minute, and\r\nis capable of entirely exhausting the tunnels in a fraction over three\r\nminutes. The fan is worked every night after the trains have ceased\r\nrunning, and travellers by the early trains literally breathe the\r\nfreshest of fresh air.\r\n\r\nIf a train in the Central should break down and come to a stop in the\r\ntunnel, though it would not, of course, be run into--the block system\r\nmaking that all but impossible--it might be necessary for the passengers\r\nto get out. The question naturally asked is, “How shall they alight? And\r\nwhere shall they go when they have alighted?” A fact that not every\r\ntraveller knows is that a narrow path at the side of the rails leads to\r\nthe nearest station, which cannot be more than a quarter of a mile off,\r\nso that no serious athletic feat is required to get out at the rear of\r\nthe train and walk along the Tube.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS ANNUAL SALE OF LOST ARTICLES\r\n\r\nLike the great trunk-lines, the Central has an annual sale of articles\r\nleft in the carriages and not claimed; but the collection differs\r\nconsiderably from the miscellaneous assortment brought together by, say,\r\nthe Great Northern or Great Western. Heavy impedimenta are, as might be\r\nexpected, absent; but who could have been the owners of the 25 bottles\r\nof whisky, the 13 boxes of cigars and cigarettes, the 300 ladies’\r\numbrellas, and the 264 gentlemen’s umbrellas, the walking-sticks\r\ninnumerable, the 150 pairs of spectacles and eyeglasses (showing that\r\nthe light is so good that reading is a favourite way of passing the\r\ntime), the 44 fur necklets, 920 pairs of gloves and 14 muffs, the 166\r\nempty purses, and the multitude of books, chiefly fiction? While every\r\nweek someone very mysteriously leaves behind a spirit-bottle--evidently\r\nrecently emptied of its contents--enclosed in cardboard and done up in a\r\nneat parcel.\r\n\r\nHow the Twopenny Tube, and others like it, were constructed will be\r\ndescribed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_THE TUBULAR SYSTEM_\r\n\r\n    “Thy arts of building from the bee receive;\r\n     Learn of the mole to plow, the worm to weave.”--POPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nLast year there were sounds of strife in that financial atmosphere where\r\ndwell Titan capitalists, who think and talk and dream in millions; a\r\nbattle of giants, like the conflict imagined by Milton, when the satanic\r\nhost levelled “triple-mounted rows” of deadly tubes with such effect\r\nagainst seraph and seraphim, “that whom they hit none on their feet\r\ncould stand, though standing else as rocks.” But the conflict now past,\r\nconcerned tubes of another kind--iron railway tubes, that seem to be the\r\ndestiny of underground metropolitan travellers. The Morgan group, the\r\nYerkes’ combination, and other great coalitions, mustered their\r\nbattalions for the fray. The London County Council, following the policy\r\nof Lord Stanley’s army at Bosworth field, hovered aloof ready to take\r\nadvantage of the defeat of either; the Corporation of London anxiously\r\nwatched from afar; the great suburban railway companies shivered in\r\ntheir shoes; a parental Legislature held the balance impartially between\r\nthe combatants; while the people whom the matter most concerned--some\r\nsix millions of Londoners--had to sit down with folded hands and,\r\npatiently or impatiently, await their fate.\r\n\r\nRecollecting this tangle and uproar of conflicting interests, it behoves\r\neverybody to have some notion of the subject of the Tubes and their\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nLike many other things in the world, there is nothing new in the idea of\r\nboring a hole through the earth and lining it with brick or iron. As\r\nPope suggests, mankind doubtless learnt the art from Nature, though the\r\ncorrectness of the poet’s zoological knowledge is hardly shown in the\r\nexamples heading this chapter. For ages past--before London\r\nexisted--that skilful excavator, the mole, tunnelled through the earth,\r\nmaking roads and galleries, the friction of his fur, set perpendicularly\r\non his skin, lining his tube so that the soil did not fall in. The larvæ\r\nof the humble caddis-fly covered the inside of their cases with fine\r\nsilk; and the trap-door spider lined its 12-inch long shaft with similar\r\nmaterial to prevent the tumbling in of loose particles and to afford\r\nitself a foothold in climbing up; while the ant constructed her\r\ngalleries and stuccoed them with the finest grains of soil, so that the\r\ninner walls presented a smooth, unbroken surface.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of man and his civilisation came the extensive use of\r\nfurs, and in these the grubs of the moth--in the abstract the most\r\nengaging of creatures--made galleries whenever they got a chance, lining\r\nthem with their own silk, wherein to undergo their transformation into\r\nthe pupa stage.\r\n\r\nWell-experienced engineers, such as the vine, beech, pine, and\r\nbark-boring beetles, are all tube-makers; but it is the pholas, or\r\n_teredo navalis_, who is the arch-borer, so skilled an expert in lining,\r\nthat, though only the size of a quill and “soft in body,” he pierces the\r\nhard timbers of ships and quay-piles, lining the tubes as he proceeds\r\nwith a saliceous substance as hard as china. The body of the Teredo is\r\nlike a long white worm, varying from a foot to two inches and a half in\r\nlength, and about the width of a finger. From him, it is said, the elder\r\nBrunel took his idea of the shield which he employed in constructing the\r\ntunnel beneath the Thames after the shaft had been excavated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. A 3,000 H.P. TRIPLE EXPANSION CENTRAL VALVE\r\nELECTRICAL ENGINE\r\n\r\n_By permission of_ _Willans and Robinson, Rugby_]\r\n\r\nBut his clever system was crude, and not calculated to cope with porous\r\nor aqueous soil; therefore, when the stratum of clay, through which the\r\nwork was being carried forward, broke off abruptly, a serious influx of\r\nwater took place. The work had to be abandoned, and was only completed\r\nafter much delay and ruinous expense. In a commercial sense, it was an\r\nutter failure.\r\n\r\nSince Brunel’s time, engineering has developed its resources _pari\r\npassu_ with the development of science. Hydraulic force displaces the\r\nprimitive screw power, and steel plates the cumbersome timber works used\r\nin the Thames tunnel.\r\n\r\nTunnelling through rock, like the Mont Cenis and St. Gothard mountains,\r\nis a comparatively simple engineering feat, as no lining is required; so\r\nalso is the ordinary railway tunnel, carefully bratticed and propped\r\ninside, and securely cased with brick or stone. But it is, as the Great\r\nWestern Railway knows to its cost, in dealing with water-bearing strata,\r\n_vide_ the Severn Tunnel, that a system is required, not only to protect\r\nthe men as they bore with a gigantic centre-bit through clay, chalk, or\r\ngravel, but, pholas-like, to line the tunnel simultaneously. This is\r\nobtained by the use of the famous shield invented by the late Mr. J. H.\r\nGreathead, and employed by him in the construction of the City and South\r\nLondon and Waterloo and City Railways, though he did not live to witness\r\nthe adoption of his principle in the Twopenny Tube.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY TUBES, HOW THEY ARE BORED\r\n\r\nA revolution in tunnelling has been brought about in constructing Tube\r\nrailways. By the new process a great cylinder or shield at the bottom of\r\na shaft is pushed forward by hydraulic power into the soil ahead of it.\r\nThe navvies work inside, excavating the earth in front of them, and fit\r\nup iron segments at the rear of the tail end of the cylinder, or shield.\r\nThus, on the one hand, the exact size and shape of the tunnel is\r\nensured, and the workers are fully protected from the risk of the roof\r\nfalling in.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement of shield and iron tube resembles an old-fashioned\r\nsingle-drawn telescope; the outer case being the shield, and the inner\r\ntube the lining of the tunnel. These shields have fronts that bear a row\r\nof steel knives forming a true cutting edge, and are so arranged that\r\nthey can, if required, bore a circle slightly larger than the iron\r\nsegments of the tube. As the shield slides away from the inner tube, the\r\nspace it occupied is filled in with what is called “grout,” a kind of\r\nporridge of water and lime, which soon sets as hard as stone. This is\r\ningeniously blown in through apertures in the iron lining by means of\r\ncompressed air, and effectually fills up cracks accidentally formed in\r\nthe soil, which might otherwise extend to the surface and cause\r\nsubsidence in the foundations of buildings. Theoretically, therefore, no\r\ndisturbance of the ground below or above the tubular lining is possible.\r\n\r\nIn the pioneer Tube railways, the City and South London for instance,\r\nthe diameter of the tunnels was only 10 feet 6 inches, that of the\r\nCentral 12 feet, but the Great Northern and City Company made a new\r\ndeparture by fixing the width at 16 feet. For the construction of this\r\nrailway, the shield was designed by Mr. E. W. Moir, M. INST. C. E., and\r\nvaries in some important respects from the Greathead shield. A\r\nremarkable photograph, which, by the courtesy of the _Tramway and\r\nRailway World_, I am able to present to the readers of this book, shows\r\nthis shield at work in the construction\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. SHIELD AT WORK IN A TUBE RUNNING TUNNEL\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _“Tramway and Railway World” Publishing Co.,\r\nLondon_]\r\n\r\nof a running tunnel, 16 feet in diameter, on the above line. The Great\r\nNorthern shield is much more powerful than any hitherto employed.\r\nGreater hydraulic force is applied, and the “jacks” are more numerous,\r\nand considerably larger. The shield used for the sixteen-foot tunnel may\r\nbe taken as typical of others up-to-date. Its cylindrical skin is\r\ncomposed of half-inch steel plates riveted together at the bottom of the\r\nindispensable shaft, which may be, in the future, anything from 50 to\r\n500 feet beneath the surface. In length, the shield from the rear to the\r\ncutting edge in front is 8 feet 9 inches, half of this being used by the\r\nexcavators (as in Brunel’s Thames tunnel), the after part for the\r\nerectors of the metal segments of the tube. Round the shield front are\r\nmounted ten heavy cast-steel cutters, the pressure upon them being no\r\nless than two tons to the square inch, the hydraulic rams exerting this\r\npressure direct upon the back of the cutters, and the purchase is taken\r\noff the edge of the nearest tunnel segment already in position. The\r\nexcavated soil is taken away in trolleys, which, as in a mine, are drawn\r\nby ponies on a miniature track, and afterwards sent up to the surface by\r\nthe nearest shaft.\r\n\r\nLondon clay is generally the kind of soil thus bored through in the\r\nmetropolitan tubes. The Central, while sinking the shafts, met with it\r\n29½ feet below the surface; but before this was reached, 12 feet of made\r\nground, 18 inches of loam, and 16 feet of gravel, had to be pierced.\r\n\r\nThe London clay ran almost without a break between the Bank and\r\nShepherd’s Bush, the only hiatus being at a point between Red Lion\r\nStreet and Berner’s Street, where the Woolwich and Reading strata\r\ncropped up, which proved to consist of hard, red, streaky clay, some\r\nbeds of white sand, and, strangely enough, beds of hard limestone rock,\r\nwhose presence had not been anticipated.\r\n\r\nTube railways are carried out at considerably varying depths; the\r\nCentral running in places 100 feet (_i.e._ the height of Westminster\r\nAbbey’s nave) below the road, and at the Bank only 65 feet.\r\n\r\nSome of the proposed tubes burrow much deeper; for instance those of\r\nCharing Cross and Hampstead Railway will be from 120 to 216 feet below\r\nthe surface. Apparently, there is no reasonable limit to the depth at\r\nwhich engineers are prepared to lay their railway tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUBE MOLE AT WORK\r\n\r\nBy an instinct--the heritage of years--of a kind that prompts\r\ngamekeepers to slaughter indiscriminately eagles, hawks, crows, magpies,\r\nowls, and even squirrels, classing them with such vermin as pole-cats,\r\nstoats, weasels, and rats, ignorant farmers and gardeners wage war\r\nagainst the mole, asserting that in driving his tunnels he throws up\r\nunsightly heaps of soil, and, worse still, loosens and destroys the\r\nroots of plants and grass, totally ignoring the fact that Mr. _Talpa\r\nEuropæa_, though he may occasionally disturb the earth around, acts as a\r\nvery efficient surface drainer, and still better, is a persistent chaser\r\nand devourer of his natural prey, the wire-worm, and other injurious\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nOur Tube mole throws up no hillocks, but he is accused of being the\r\nsource of much mischief, and of endangering the houses on the\r\nsurface--damaging, as it were, their roots--by the vibration arising\r\nfrom the continual passage of trains along the iron galleries and the\r\nconsequent subsidence of the ground. This has given rise to numerous\r\ncomplaints, so pronounced as to become the subject of an official\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nSome foolish objections have been raised to deep-level railways, and\r\nequally unreasonable claims for injury done by them have been brought\r\ninto court. Where a vibration clause is inserted in any Tube Railway\r\nBill, there might be ingenious claims manufactured for compensation. For\r\ninstance, a watchmaker might come forward and say that the vibration\r\ncaused by the railway prevented him from setting his chronometers, or a\r\nwine merchant might say that his wines were shaken up; and in this way\r\nthe company might be subject to endless litigation.\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed to bore tunnels 70 feet below the royal demesnes of\r\nHyde Park, St. James’s Park, and the Green Park, and as much as 216 feet\r\nbelow Hampstead Heath, approximating in the former case to the height of\r\nQueen Eleanor’s memorial at Charing Cross, and in the latter to that of\r\nthe twin towers of Westminster Abbey, it was at once urged by the\r\nrepresentatives of a certain Preservation Society that the trees,\r\nplants, and flowers of the three parks would be detrimentally affected\r\nby the Tube, and that the Hampstead Heath tunnels would “very probably\r\ndrain the upper surface of the soil and destroy vegetation all round.”\r\nTo which unthought-out contention Mr. R. E. Middleton, a well-known\r\ncivil engineer, replied that “at the depths proposed for the parks the\r\ntunnels were to be constructed through a stratum, not of loose soil, but\r\nof stiff London clay, so that any question of destroying trees, plants,\r\nor flowers was rather absurd; in fact, vegetation would in no way be\r\naffected.” He might have added the argument that, although ordinary\r\nrailway tunnels abound, no one had ever heard of the overlying fields\r\nand woods being deleteriously affected by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAIMS FOR DAMAGE BY TUBING\r\n\r\nNow, in dealing with the matter of alleged injuries to buildings from\r\nvibration set up by Tube railways, I quote the following case to show\r\nhow visionary are some of the claims brought against Tube Companies.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of October last, at the Lambeth County Court, an action was\r\nbrought against the Great Northern and City Railway Company by an\r\nindividual living in Hoxton for damage alleged to have been done to his\r\npremises by the construction of the tunnels. The plaintiff stated that\r\nin consequence of this the repairs of his house had cost him £62, and\r\nthat in another house of his, cracks had appeared. A photograph, taken\r\ntwelve months before the tunnels were made, which showed a crack in\r\nfront of one of the houses, was pointed out to the witness, who said\r\nthat he had never noticed it.\r\n\r\nFor the defence Mr. Douglas Young stated that he acted for the Company\r\nwhen the tunnels were about to be constructed, and, anticipating claims\r\nof this nature, he caused photographs to be taken of all houses which\r\nshowed cracks on the line of route. The cracks shown in the photos then\r\ntaken were practically in the same condition now. The repairs necessary\r\nwere not caused by damage done by the tunnels, and came entirely within\r\nthe repairing clauses of the leases. The jury returned a verdict for the\r\ndefendant Company on the ground that no damage had been done by them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, among the Tube Railway cases brought into court last\r\nyear and this, was the following, which illustrates the contention that\r\nthough there may be a certain amount of truth in the plaintiff’s\r\narguments, exaggerated ideas prevail as to the sums that can be claimed\r\nfor injury, present or prospective. It also shows the uncertain state of\r\nthe law on the subject of ownership of the subsoil--a hard legal nut.\r\n\r\nIn the London Sheriff’s Court, 17th April, 1902, Mr. Under-Sheriff\r\nBurchell sat, with a special jury, to consider a claim for compensation\r\nbrought by Mr. William Howard, of 11, Cornwall Terrace, Regent’s Park,\r\nagainst the Baker Street and Waterloo Electric Railway.\r\n\r\nMr. Morton, K.C., said that in August, 1900, Mr. Howard became aware\r\nthat a subsidence was taking place, and that the walls of his house were\r\ncracking, this being unmistakably due to the borings for the railway\r\nwhich were being made underneath the property. In the course of these\r\nborings the Company had taken away part of the subsoil of the claimant’s\r\npremises without having given notice to treat, and this, counsel\r\nsubmitted, constituted a distinct trespass. The value of the property,\r\ncounsel contended, had been deteriorated to the extent of at least £50\r\nper annum. Mr. Howard’s lease had ten years to run, the rental being\r\n£200 a year.\r\n\r\nAfter expert evidence had been given, the Hon. A. Lyttelton, K.C., for\r\nthe railway company, said it was ridiculous to assert that the Company\r\nhad committed an act of trespass. They disputed the claimant’s alleged\r\nownership to land sixty-five feet below his premises, and were\r\ndetermined to fight the question in the courts, inasmuch as it was one\r\nwhich affected the whole of the electric tube railways in London.\r\n\r\nOne witness called on behalf of the Company said that the damage to the\r\nproperty could be remedied by the expenditure of a ten-pound note.\r\n\r\nThe Under-Sheriff said that an important feature of the case which the\r\njury had to decide was whether the claimant was the owner of the\r\nsubsoil. As such he would be entitled to compensation for any vibration\r\nthat might occur when the railway commenced to run in about two years’\r\ntime. He left it to the jury to decide their verdict under two heads,\r\nnamely, “what damages had at present been sustained,” and, “what damage\r\nwas likely to accrue through vibration.”\r\n\r\nAfter a brief deliberation the jury awarded £357, in one sum, as\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of February of the present year, before Mr. Justice Ridley\r\nand a special jury, the hearing was resumed of the case in which Mrs.\r\nDawson, a widow, carrying on the business of a draper at the junction of\r\nCity Road and East Street, sued the Great Northern and City Railway for\r\n£10,000 damages, alleged to have been caused by the tunnelling\r\noperations in the vicinity of her premises. The claim included some\r\n£4,000 which it is estimated it would cost to put the buildings in a\r\nproper state of repair, and £5,000 representing loss of business during\r\nthe time it would take to complete the work of reinstatement.\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff under the following heads:\r\nAmount for taking the subsoil occupied by the tunnel, £50; structural\r\ndamage, £2,000; damage to trade and stock, £2,100; total, £4,150.\r\n\r\nMr. Dobb asked that judgment should be entered.\r\n\r\nMr. McCall thought the judge had no power to enter a judgment of the\r\nHigh Court because the proceedings were in the form of an interpleader\r\naction.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Ridley said he would give judgment in the sense in which the\r\nword was used in the Lands Clauses Act.\r\n\r\nJudgment was given accordingly.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Auctioneers’ Institute held last year, Mr. G. M.\r\nFreeman, K.C., speaking on this subject, pertinently remarked that\r\nvarious questions were likely to arise between the promotors of the new\r\norder of underground railway and the owners of adjacent property, and he\r\ngave it as his opinion that the assertion that no possible damage would\r\nbe caused, had not been wholly verified, and that the rights of\r\ncompensation to persons equally injured ought not to depend upon whether\r\na piece of the subsoil under the street was or was not appropriated. In\r\nhis judgment, all owners who could prove damage done by the construction\r\nor working of an underground railway, should have the same title to\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIBRATION\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the Board of Trade inquiry last year into the vexed\r\nquestion of tube vibration was interesting. It showed that alleged\r\nannoyance from vibration has not been altogether imaginary, and some\r\nnovel facts were produced. Fourteen meetings were held, and evidence was\r\ngiven by some of the residents along the line of the Central Railway\r\nroute, their habitat ranging from Bucklersbury in the City to Kensington\r\nPalace Gardens in the west. A large number of the witnesses represented\r\nhouseholders having “frontages,” and among others, the Holborn Borough\r\nCouncil. They all deposed as to annoyance caused by the vibration, and\r\nwere of opinion that the shaking was most perceptible when the trains\r\nfirst began running in the morning; between five and eight p.m.; and\r\nshortly after midnight, just before the trains ceased running.\r\n\r\nHad any of these gentlemen resided on the north side of Victoria Street,\r\nnear its western end, they would hardly have complained about mere\r\nvibration. In that delectable locality the backs of the houses overlook\r\nthe Metropolitan District Railway, and if the dining-room happen to be\r\nin the rear, as in many of the flats it is, every wine-glass and tumbler\r\non the table quivers in a fearful manner, all the ornaments tremble, and\r\nthe whole apartment is agitated as each train thunders by.\r\n\r\nBut even this is nothing, contrasted with the daily experience of\r\ndwellers in suburban side streets, where passing of steam-rollers,\r\npantechnicon-vans, and other elephantine vehicles, not only shakes the\r\ntenements to their basements, but forces out the mortar that is supposed\r\nto bind together the brickwork, dislocates the window-frames, turns\r\naskew the pictures on the walls, and would eventually, if not seen to,\r\nreduce the “eligible villas” to ruin.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Board of Trade Committee, as in duty bound, personally\r\ninvestigated the Tube complaints and satisfied themselves that\r\nvibrations, sufficient to cause vexation to the inmates, were really\r\nfelt in some of the houses near the Central, and the result of the\r\ninquiry was as follows:--\r\n\r\nThat it was a matter of chance whether any given train caused a slight,\r\nor a severe, vibration; also that trains which produced much _tremblór\r\nde tiérra_ in one house, as likely as not caused but little in another,\r\nand that apparently different apartments in the same residence were not\r\nsimilarly affected by one and the same train. It was demonstrated that\r\nthe locomotives, and not the cars, were responsible for the greater part\r\nof the disturbances, the reason assigned being that too great a\r\nspringless load was carried on each axle of the engines, a method of\r\nconstruction adopted to obviate the necessity for gearing.\r\n\r\nActing upon the Committee’s representation, the Central Railway Company\r\nordered two new types of locomotives, in one of which the\r\n“unspring-borne” load was much reduced by gearing. The other was not\r\ndistinct from but attached to the train, the motors being carried at one\r\nend of two or more coaches--the motor-car system of electric traction in\r\nfact. The difference in weight was remarkable; the original gearless\r\nengines being 44 tons, the new geared pattern 33 tons, while the\r\nmotor-cars only came up to 20 tons.\r\n\r\nSome novel experiments were made, and in order to identify the trains,\r\nthe houses in which the observers took their places with recording\r\ninstruments were connected by telephone with the signal-boxes at the\r\nadjoining stations. Quite satisfactory were the results, and it was\r\nfound that, during some two hours, the passing of every train drawn by\r\nthe heavy gearless locomotive was distinctly felt, but was not\r\ndiscernible when the new engines were attached. Therefore the Committee\r\nconcluded that, so far as the Central was concerned, the adoption of\r\nmotor-cars would so reduce the _tremblement de terre_ as to cause all\r\nreal annoyance to cease, though the sound of the trains, particularly at\r\nnight, might still be detected. As to the oscillation of the cars--a\r\nrather marked feature in the Tube--it was attributed by the Committee’s\r\nexperts to the unevenness of the surface of the rails. As these leave\r\nthe rolling-mills they are usually slightly curved, and the process of\r\nstraightening them _in situ_, however skilfully carried out, inevitably\r\nleaves a certain amount of waviness. When the speed is high, a condition\r\nof things soon arises whereby the irregular impulses produced by the\r\nuneven rail surfaces establishes a rocking movement of the rails and the\r\nroad-bed, converting both into an elastic instead of a rigid support.\r\nThis is increased and maintained by the pounding of the gearless\r\nlocomotives in the narrow tubes, intensified by the hard unyielding\r\nmaterial of which they are composed.\r\n\r\nAnother fact to which the Committee called attention was, that in\r\nconsequence of the small diameter of the tunnels (12 feet), the fit was\r\ntoo close, and the pressure in front of the trains necessitated greater\r\npower to overcome it than if more space had been left between the roofs\r\nof the carriages and the tubes.\r\n\r\nIn the agitation respecting damage alleged to have been done by the\r\nconstruction of the Tubes, it was proved that provided the apertures are\r\nmade of sufficient size, and suitable locomotives used, and the\r\npermanent way properly laid with stiffer and deeper rails, the chance of\r\ninjury to houses by the _moviéndo la tiérra_, as the Spaniards call it,\r\ncan be reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nModern science tells us that earth tremblings are with us at all times\r\nand in all places to an extent not realised. We are assured that, by\r\nProfessor J. Milne’s instruments, quiverings, and slopings of the\r\nearth’s crust, insensible to the most delicate spirit-levels, can be\r\ndetected. It is now known that earthquake movements can be felt right\r\nthrough the earth, and all round its surface. Latterly, Professor Milne\r\nhas also discovered that his observatory in the Isle of Wight sinks\r\nslowly during a part of the year, and rises as slowly during another\r\npart--as if the breast of the earth were heaving. For five months in the\r\nyear, the tall buildings in a city may be heeling over towards the west;\r\nthen they come back with extreme slowness to the perpendicular, and\r\nfinally cant a little to the east.\r\n\r\nSurely, then, we need not complain about an occasional mild earth-shake\r\nproduced by the passing of the useful Underground, or Tube trains,\r\nseeing that the good they do so far outweighs their defects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_TOURING IN THE TUBES_\r\n\r\nA SKETCH\r\n\r\n“She doth stray about.”--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosamond was a pleasant, chatty, little woman, and a universal\r\nfavourite. Her abundant hair was brown, her eyes, shaded by long dark\r\nlashes, were deepest blue, and above them rose, not the “bar of Michael\r\nAngelo,” but a low, smooth, and pretty forehead, where, however, a\r\nphrenologist would have looked in vain for the faintest trace of the\r\n“bump of locality.” She was a shrewd judge of character in men and\r\nwomen, especially the former. She loved beautiful scenery and everything\r\nrefined in art and literature. She had great sympathy with the suffering\r\nand distressed; but her ability to take mental notes of things and\r\nplaces, and to find her way about towns and cities, as some do by\r\ninstinct, was utterly wanting in Lilian Rosamond; yet, with the strange\r\nperversity that impels people with bad eyesight to drive dog-carts or\r\nmotor-cars, or to steer yachts, she persisted in going about strange\r\nlocalities unaccompanied, and when any expedition was planned,\r\naudaciously posed as an authority on quickest and best routes. But she\r\nwas a native of the fair “North countree,” and, lying _perdu_ beneath\r\nher sweet disposition, was a vein--a thin one--of self-will.\r\n\r\n“Why,” she argued, “should she not find her way about like other people?\r\nHad she not from childhood lived at Lymm, Cheshire, and roamed about\r\nthat district without difficulty? Had she not frequently travelled to\r\nthe old county city? Had she not braved the terrors of the Great Central\r\nStation at Manchester _en route_ for Halifax--changed carriages there,\r\nin fact? And had she not once actually journeyed all by herself to\r\nLondon on a visit, returning safely to her own town?” All of which was\r\nperfectly true, but she omitted to add that, in going up to town, her\r\nparents had, as it were, to see her “labelled and consigned” through the\r\nmedium of a fatherly guard, while her friends in town had been strictly\r\nenjoined on no account to miss meeting her at Euston, and never to let\r\nher go anywhere in the metropolis unaccompanied. In fact, her family\r\nwere in an agony of suspense until she was back again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosamond had married a gentleman-farmer of Welsh extraction, and\r\nher life had fallen on pleasant lines in a remote Radnorshire village\r\nbearing an unpronounceable name made up of consonants. The year 1902\r\narrived, and with it, in June, an invitation from her sister-in-law to\r\nspend Coronation week with her in Edith Road, West Kensington; and off\r\nshe started, her easy-going husband, who had seldom tested his wife’s\r\nsense (or absence) of locality, and had no suspicion of how much it was\r\nlacking, merely remarking as he saw her into the train, “Now, my dear,\r\nmind you wait at Paddington a reasonable time to see if Annie is there\r\nto meet you. She is not always punctual, and if she does not turn up,\r\ntake a cab. Don’t attempt to get to Edith Road by omnibus or Underground\r\nRailway. You don’t know London, and a four-wheeler will be cheaper in\r\nthe long run. Now, don’t forget this, there’s a dear little woman, or I\r\nshall worry all day long about you.”\r\n\r\nIn the same carriage with her was a lady of uncertain age, whom Mrs.\r\nRosamond quickly guessed to be unmarried and an “organiser”--one of\r\nthose assertive, independent, “heel-less” women of the genus\r\n_plantigrade_, who know everything and want no assistance from anybody.\r\nFalling into conversation, Lilian Rosamond remarked that she hoped to\r\nsee the King’s procession to the Abbey, a seat having long ago been\r\nsecured for her, and that she had been told she would have to go a very\r\nlong distance from the West End and might have to start by the first\r\ntrain on the Twopenny Tube to the Bank, and that then by _another_ Tube\r\nshe somehow would get to the Borough High Street (where her “stand” was\r\nsituated) by way of the “Elephant and Castle.”\r\n\r\nThis led to the subject of West Kensington, her destination, and how she\r\nproposed reaching it from Paddington. “Why,” said the plantigrade lady,\r\n“what on earth made your husband tell you to take a cab? It is two miles\r\noff at least, and you are sure to be over-charged. Never mind what he\r\nsaid. Men are always extravagant in these matters. Besides, you can\r\nthink for yourself; you are a woman, not a baby. Now, I’ll tell you what\r\nto do. If your sister is not at the station, book your luggage--you say\r\nyou have not got much with you--to be sent on by the railway parcel van,\r\ncross the road to the Praed Street District Railway Station, get out at\r\nNotting Hill Gate, cross the road there to the Tube station, and for\r\ntwopence you will be at Shepherd’s Bush in a few minutes.”\r\n\r\nThis suggestion seemed to Mrs. Rosamond good and attractive, but she\r\nbravely resisted the allurements of a journey by an unfamiliar route;\r\nand, recalling her husband and his injunction, after waiting a quarter\r\nof an hour at Euston and finding that no one came for her, she allowed\r\nherself to be stowed away by an attentive and sympathetic porter into a\r\nstale, straw-smelling four-wheeler, and arrived safely at No. 28, when\r\ncabby promptly asked, and received, half a crown--a moderate\r\neighteenpence more than his legitimate fare; but cabmen, like\r\neverybody else, must live somehow!\r\n\r\nThe longest day recorded in the almanac dawned clear and fair, and Mrs.\r\nRosamond, rising at an unearthly early hour, started for Islington,\r\nwhere she had promised to breakfast with a relative--an unusual kind of\r\nfeat to attempt, but easy of accomplishment by leaving Shepherd’s Bush\r\nvery early for the Bank of England, where, as it was explained to her in\r\nan off-hand, businesslike manner by her sister’s husband, all she had to\r\ndo was to hit the right subway, book afresh at the Bank Station of the\r\nCity and South London Electric Railway, and “in a jiffy, as easy as A B\r\nC” (so he put it) she would find herself at the “Angel,” Islington, and\r\nbe with her aunt in time for the coffee and rolls.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosamond was delighted at the prospect, and no happier woman than\r\nshe stood outside the Tube’s terminus that bright summer morning.\r\n\r\nThe booking-office was full of people--of the working class, thought\r\nfair Mrs. Rosamond, who, observing that each person paid the sum of\r\nthree-halfpence through the glass partition that screened the clerks\r\nfrom too close contact with the public, tendered that modest sum like\r\nthe others, without specifying her destination. But though plainly, she\r\nwas too daintily dressed and too self-evidently a lady to escape notice,\r\nand was rather surprised at being asked if she wanted a workman’s\r\nticket. “Oh no!” she hastily exclaimed. “I am only going to the Bank,\r\nand then to Islington on a visit.” “Well, then, your fare is twopence.”\r\nAnd she received in return a small slip of paper and not the familiar\r\npasteboard ticket covered with undecipherable letters and figures.\r\n\r\nFollowing the crowd, Mrs. Rosamond dropped the document into a sloping\r\nbox fixed at the side of the gate and presided over by a railway\r\nofficial, the process suggesting to her lively imagination the method by\r\nwhich votes are recorded at a School Board election.\r\n\r\nWide open stood the door of a gigantic lift, the like of which she had\r\nnever seen, which quickly filled with a compact mass of some fifty men\r\nand a sprinkling of women. There were upholstered benches at the sides;\r\nand a civil young artisan offered her his seat, but Lilian preferred to\r\nstand and look about her. The electro-lighted apartment was not\r\næsthetic, and the unsightly advertisements, and notices warning\r\ntravellers against smoking, spitting, or standing too near the doors,\r\ndid not add to its beauty; and when the telescopic gates were clashed\r\ntogether and fastened, the whole thing reminded Mrs. Rosamond of a great\r\ncage full of specimens of the British _Homo Sapiens_ packed for\r\nconveyance and exhibition to inhabitants of other regions.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, gently, and noiselessly the lift began to descend, and it\r\nseemed as if it would never stop. But stop it did, at a depth of seventy\r\nfeet, which might have been seven hundred so far as Mrs. Rosamond’s\r\nsensations were concerned. Once again the iron gates clashed, and the\r\nwild animals--I mean the passengers--streamed forth, our fair traveller\r\nfollowing, to the platform.\r\n\r\nWas she dreaming? Had she, like Alice in Wonderland, suddenly become\r\ndiminutive, and was she waiting for a well-groomed little white rabbit,\r\nwith gold watch and chain, to emerge from what resembled a burrow at the\r\nend of the station? It was so _very_ small. Everything was on a reduced\r\nscale, the standing-room was a mere strip of planking, the tube like a\r\npea-shooter. Surely it would not take in the train! However, it was\r\ndeliciously cool and light, and the tiles that lined the station were,\r\nas she found by touching them with her gloved hands, perfectly free from\r\nsmuts.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, from the open cutting at the opposite end of the\r\nplatform, where lay the shunting tracks, a bright light and metallic\r\nclattering heralded the strange-looking chimneyless locomotive. Behind\r\nit came five attractive-looking cars joined together, and gleaming with\r\nlight. At their point of junction were telescopic gates, flung open as\r\nsoon as the train stopped, and Mrs. Rosamond, who had just time to\r\nobserve that there were not _two_ rails only on the track, but a _third_\r\nin the middle, hurried into the first car she could find, and the\r\nearliest train on the Tube glided into the tunnel _en route_ for the\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nLilian Rosamond at once discovered that the cars just fitted the Tube.\r\nShe would like to have touched the sides, but as the windows were sealed\r\nup this was impossible.\r\n\r\nEverything looked delightfully clean, and, considering the crowd, she\r\nwas lucky to find a seat next to an intelligent and quiet-looking,\r\nmiddle-aged man, who turned out to be a foreman engaged upon great\r\nbuilding works proceeding in the City. The speed increased, and the\r\nnoise and the rattling of the cars increased in proportion--a condition\r\nof things she had not expected, and it was a relief when the train\r\nslowed down and made its first pause at Holland Park. Here a few workmen\r\ngot in, but not a soul got out! Mrs. Rosamond, looking about her,\r\nnoticed that her _companions de voyage_ were not in appearance such as\r\nshe had expected at so early an hour. It is true they nearly all\r\nsmoked--cigarettes mostly--some sticking to the old-fashioned short clay\r\npipe charged with most pungent tobacco; but they did not swear or use\r\nstrong language, they were not all dressed in corduroy, nor were their\r\nclothes dirty, neither did they universally carry huge “bass-bags”\r\ncontaining saws, and other sharp and nasty tools. Her neighbour, the\r\nforeman, with whom she soon got into a lively conversation, told her\r\nthat most of the men (masons chiefly) were employed on a “big job” at\r\nFinsbury, and would travel to the Bank. He also volunteered the\r\ninformation that he lived in Caxton Road, close to the Shepherd’s Bush\r\nStation of the Tube; that he had to get his own breakfast at 4.30 or\r\nthereabouts, or wait until he got to the City, when he had it at a snug\r\nlittle coffee-shop in Moorfields; that he had used the Tube ever since\r\nits opening in 1900 day after day, starting by the first train in the\r\nmorning, and returning, as his place and work suited, along the route at\r\nall hours, from five o’clock to eight, and sometimes (though seldom) by\r\nthe last train from the Bank at 12.30 p.m.; and that the cars between\r\nthe former hours--when people were leaving the City for the day--were\r\nmore crowded than in the early morning, in fact crammed, with not even\r\nstanding room.\r\n\r\nAt Notting Hill Gate there was a rush of operatives. By this time the\r\ncars were packed, and the little woman perceived the uses of the sliding\r\nleather straps suspended overhead, to which the unlucky seatless ones,\r\nwho filled up the whole of the gangway, held on like grim death, to\r\navoid tumbling about as the train oscillated.\r\n\r\nAt the Marble Arch some few persons, a dozen or so, tried to push in,\r\nbut the five cars were _complet_, and so they continued, until, at the\r\nBritish Museum Station, a section of the passengers alighted, as also at\r\nChancery Lane and the General Post Office. Then, after a run of 6½ miles\r\nfrom Shepherd’s Bush in twenty-four minutes, the Central “early workmen”\r\npulled up at the Bank terminus at a platform resembling the others all\r\nalong the line.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosamond went up in a big lift, not to the surface as she expected,\r\nbut found herself landed in a broad asphalted, bewildering subway lined\r\nwith white bricks. Brilliantly lighted white passages seemed to stretch\r\naway in all directions, full of people tearing about here, there, and\r\neverywhere in the utmost confusion, some ascending steps that appeared\r\nto lead to the daylight, others descending slopes that ended in more\r\nbrick-lined passages. At once she recalled her host’s injunction “to hit\r\nthe right subway” for the Islington Tube Line, but becoming a trifle\r\nexcited and confused, she went up the staircase that looked the\r\nshortest, and found herself in Cornhill, along which she strayed a short\r\ndistance, and came to St. Michael’s, when she thought she had reached\r\nthe station, because she had been told it was underneath a church. But\r\nthere was no City and South London Railway, and her host had omitted to\r\nsay that the subway between it and the Bank was contemplated only. So\r\nLilian asked her way, and quickly found what she was seeking close by at\r\nthe corner of Lombard Street and King William Street. And now, growing\r\nconfident by experience, and perceiving that the booking-office and\r\ngeneral arrangements resembled those of the Two-penny Tube, though on a\r\nsmaller scale, she went to the booking-office window and tendered\r\ntwopence. The clerk politely inquired, “All the way, miss?” and on her\r\nreplying in the affirmative, demanded, and received, fourpence, giving\r\nher an ordinary ticket in return. She thought this strange, being\r\ndifferent from the Tube system, the more so when she saw no glass box\r\nwherein to drop it. But there was the lift, and so she descended. Alas!\r\nwhen she got to the bottom, she forgot to make inquiries, being absorbed\r\nin meditation about her husband. “What was he doing at that particular\r\nhour?” she wondered. “Had he gone out fishing? Was he making the rounds\r\nof his farm, and looking after his pet livestock, the pigs?” A train\r\ncame up, and without giving the matter a second thought, she got into\r\nit, and found the cars pretty nearly empty. They were narrow and low,\r\nand the atmosphere was close.\r\n\r\nAway they sped, by London Bridge, the Borough, the “Elephant and\r\nCastle,” Kennington Park Road, the Oval, and Stockwell, but the guard\r\ndid not call out the names of these stations, and only when the terminus\r\nwas reached did Lilian rouse herself from her reverie, and stepping out\r\nof the station after giving up her ticket, gazed aghast, not at the\r\n“Angel,” Islington, which she knew was a locality nearly all bricks and\r\nmortar, but upon a large open space--Clapham Common! In fact, the poor\r\n_voyageuse_ had gone down the wrong lift at the Bank Station, and had\r\nfailed to notice the names of the stations as she came along.\r\n\r\nTo recover her equanimity, Mrs. Rosamond thought she would stroll about\r\na little before going back to Islington, which, it was explained to\r\nher, was at the other extremity of the line. Much refreshed by an hour’s\r\nwalk and the novelty of the _terra incognita_, she booked again, and\r\nresumed her pilgrimage, determined that this time there should be no\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nWhat was it? Was it fatality? or was it some mischievous whispering\r\nspirit that caused her to keep mentally repeating the words, “Bank\r\nStation”? An echo, perhaps, of the instructions received the evening\r\nbefore. Anyhow, she did not go straight on, but as soon as the train\r\nreached the City, she alighted at the Bank, and found herself once more\r\nin the maze of subways branching off from the Central’s booking-office.\r\nThe little woman was in despair. What must she do? It was no use asking\r\nher way, everybody seemed in too violent a hurry to attend to other\r\npeople; so she walked mechanically down a disagreeably steep asphalted\r\nincline and along a wood-paved, white-tiled tunnel, and saw at the end\r\nan electric Tube station. There was the usual narrow platform, the\r\nglazed tunnel, the electric light, and the four-car train, but no\r\nqueer-shaped engine, and the carriages looked smaller than those of the\r\nCentral and of a different build, the glazed sides sloping inwards\r\ntowards the low roof. There was no booking-office, so she stepped into\r\nthe train, where, as in an omnibus, tickets were issued and punched for\r\nthe sum of two-pence. The cars were narrow and stuffy, and she did not\r\nlike them, but looking up, she caught sight of a brass plate giving the\r\nname of the engineers at Preston, Lancashire, and this quite cheered\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIn about five minutes the train stopped, and everybody got out and\r\nstreamed up stairways and along passages into what proved to be a vast\r\nrailway terminus--Waterloo; and she realised the dismal fact that by\r\ninadvertence she had taken the Waterloo and City Railway, instead of the\r\nCity and South London! It was the word “City” running in her head that\r\nhad done the mischief.\r\n\r\nNothing was left but to return, and so, through lofty cavernous regions\r\nbeneath the terminus, over bridges, and down endless slopes of\r\nwood-paving, she managed to reach the up-platform.\r\n\r\nNow came the rush of early City-bound men, season-ticket holders, who\r\nhad travelled by the London and South Western line from all parts of\r\nSurrey served by it. They came pelting down the inclines as if their\r\nlives depended upon catching a particular train. Most of them carried\r\nneat hand-bags, suggestive of legal documents or company prospectuses,\r\nand nearly all had a morning paper. The bulk of them were well dressed,\r\nwith an indefinable air indicative of the suburban resident. Mrs.\r\nRosamond found them exceedingly pleasant, and was soon chatting with a\r\nmilitary-looking gentleman, irreproachably groomed, with a lined and\r\nshrewd face, and old enough to be her father. He was, in fact, an\r\neminent solicitor in Tower Royal, Cannon Street, who, hearing of her\r\nadventures, appeared to sympathise very deeply. “A little _too_ deeply,”\r\nsaid her husband, on hearing her narrative, not that he was distrustful\r\nor jealous, but he preferred to do most of the sympathising himself. The\r\nman of law tried to be facetious, and in explaining at some length the\r\ndifference between metropolitan “tubes” and the “Underground,” so\r\nconfused Mrs. Rosamond that she ended by thinking they were one and the\r\nsame thing--a fatal error on her part, as we shall see. Dilating upon\r\nthe subject, and upon the trials she had endured that morning, he\r\nremarked that he was sure her friends and the world in general would be\r\ngreat losers were so pleasant and vivacious a lady as herself to remain\r\nunderground. At which fair Rosamond smiled--she had beautiful teeth, and\r\na smile became her; but she grew somewhat reserved in manner when he\r\ninsisted upon escorting her along the right subway, and felt decidedly\r\nrelieved when he courteously left her on the pavement at the “Poultry,”\r\nby Mappin and Webb’s.\r\n\r\nIt was getting on towards eleven o’clock, and Mistress Rosamond, who,\r\nbeyond a cup of coffee hastily swallowed before she started, had tasted\r\nnothing for six hours, began to feel faint, experiencing that\r\ndistressing sensation which makes one think the ground is about to rise\r\nup and strike one, and that hearing and vision are about to fail. She\r\n_must_ have something to eat and drink, but _where?_ Dimly she recalled\r\nhow in the old days a very dear brother, who knew his London well, was\r\nfond of expatiating upon the merits of certain reliable places\r\nin the City where the inner man could be most satisfactorily\r\nrefreshed--Birch’s, Sweeting’s, Pimm’s in the “Poultry.” Why, she was\r\nactually standing in the “Poultry”! So, following the curt, but\r\nrespectful, directions of a civic policeman, who must have been at least\r\nsix feet two inches in his stockings, she, without crossing the road,\r\neasily discovered the haven of refuge in question, and being shown up to\r\nthe ladies’ dining-room, sat down at a table near a window which looked\r\nupon busy Cheapside.\r\n\r\nThough rather too early in the day for the regular menu, consultation\r\nwith a grey-headed waiter--who strongly reminded her of some Church\r\ndignitary (a dean for choice) in layman’s attire, and who became\r\nimmensely interested in his client, partly because her blue eyes\r\nrecalled to him those of a daughter “lost awhile”--resulted, within\r\ntwenty minutes, in a dainty repast, some scalloped oysters, a “portion”\r\nof the choicest Scotch salmon cold, with cucumber, and dainty roll and\r\nbutter, followed by a cheese soufflé, and--by the “dean’s”\r\nadvice--neither tea, coffee, nor wine, but a glass, just one glass, of\r\nPimm’s “particular” stout, a beverage our traveller was unaccustomed to,\r\nbut found an admirable accompaniment to her fish luncheon. The bill was\r\npaid with a handsome _douceur_, which the “dean” condescended to accept;\r\nand refreshed, and with renewed determination to carry out her original\r\nline of march, Mrs. Rosamond stepped out and walked along Cheapside.\r\n\r\nThere the shops at once attracted her attention: the jewellers, the\r\nhosiers--in one of which latter she bought some neckties and collars for\r\nher spouse--the print-sellers, and the London Stereoscopic Company’s\r\nseductive window. Here she looked up at the church clock far above her\r\nhead, and finding the time getting on, and becoming just a little\r\nflurried at the discovery, started at once to resume her wanderings. “If\r\nyou please, constable, can you tell me the nearest way to the\r\nUnderground Railway?” “Straight as you can go, miss, down the lane, Bow\r\nLane, in front of you, and you will find the station across the road at\r\nthe bottom.” “Thank you very much,” and, mentally, “What a fine set of\r\nfellows the City policemen are! I wonder if they are all married; where\r\ndo they live, and what are their wages?”\r\n\r\nStraight down the narrow lane she went, and at the Cannon Street end\r\nasked another policeman the way to the Underground. He pointed to the\r\nopposite side of the road, and, stopping the traffic, conveyed her\r\nacross, and she found herself in the Mansion House Station of the\r\nDistrict Railway.\r\n\r\nThere were no officials to be seen, only the booking-clerks, one of\r\nwhom, with the professional instinct for turning an honest penny for his\r\nemployers, instead of advising her to return to the Bank close by, up\r\nVictoria Street, promptly recommended her to book by the District\r\nRailway to Bishopsgate Street, get across Finsbury Circus to Moorgate\r\nStreet, and then take the City and South London Tube Railway to the\r\n“Angel.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Mrs. Rosamond had become too tired to discuss the matter,\r\nand was disinclined to go back by the way she had come. So she got into\r\na first-class carriage of a Circle train, and, with a sigh of relief,\r\nsettled down snugly into the far corner.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the reaction, or the effect of the glass of stout, was\r\nnever known, but after passing Cannon Street Mrs. Rosamond began to feel\r\ndrowsy and dreamy, imagining she was nearing home in the local train,\r\nand wondering if her husband had received her telegram, and would come\r\nto meet her. She fell asleep, and a lovely picture she made, with lips\r\nslightly parted, and her long, curved eyelashes resting, like a child’s,\r\non her soft cheeks. There was revealed just a few inches of well-fitting\r\nblack silk clocked stockings, neatly-turned ankles, and a charming pair\r\nof very small dark tan shoes.\r\n\r\nTime sped on, and, with it, the Circle train, past Bishopsgate,\r\nFarringdon Street, and King’s Cross, with its maze of metropolitan\r\nunderground lines; through dismal tunnels, black with smoke; through\r\nbrick-lined cuttings, foul with sooty deposit; past stations, each one\r\nhung, by way of adornment, with the same monotonous, highly-coloured\r\n“works of art,” drawing attention to Colman’s Mustard, Reckitt’s Blue,\r\nNestle’s Milk, Bovril, Oxo, Lemco, Globe Polish, Ogden’s Cigarettes,\r\nBird’s Custards, and Stephen’s Inks, and provided with\r\npenny-in-the-slot machines, with bookstalls bearing a strong family\r\nlikeness, and with here and there a refreshment bar, where buns and\r\nsandwiches of the Mugby Junction type might be had.\r\n\r\nAt High Street, Kensington, where the engine was changed, the guard\r\nlooked in, admired the sleeping beauty, and discreetly withdrew in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the tunnel between Sloane Square and Victoria, the\r\ntrain pulled up with a jerk, the signal having been suddenly put against\r\nit. Mrs. Rosamond woke, and looking at her watch, found that she must\r\nhave been slumbering nearly an hour, and a fellow-passenger told her\r\nthat by the time the train reached the Mansion House Station she would\r\nhave completely traversed the circle of the Underground! “Well, I _will_\r\nsee this matter through,” she said to herself, “and I will not go again\r\ninto that horrid Bank Subway. After all, I shall soon be at Bishopsgate\r\nStreet.” So she went on.\r\n\r\nHow, on her arrival there, she escaped having to pay the full fare, no\r\none knows. She kept her own counsel; but the ticket collector and the\r\nguard probably thought she was too nice to be worried with\r\ninterrogations.\r\n\r\nHer brief impressions of the Underground were that only in a few\r\nrespects was the Tube an improvement upon it. The Inner Circle Trains,\r\nshe thought, ran more smoothly; there was less rocking of the carriages,\r\nand less rattling noise; but they were badly lighted; the banging of\r\ndoors was awful; the atmosphere sulphurous and stifling; and carriages,\r\nstations, staircases, and tunnels looked as if they had not been cleaned\r\nfor months. Worse than all was the mode of pulling up the train with a\r\njerk, which, at each stopping-place, almost invariably threw the\r\nalighting passengers into their fellow-travellers’ laps.\r\n\r\nResolved now to ask her way at every step, she contrived, by minutely\r\nfollowing directions, to find and to cross Finsbury Circus, whence she\r\nwas quickly in Moorgate Street, and at once discovered the City and\r\nSouth London Railway Station. Continuing to seek information for the\r\nIslington lift, the Islington platform, and the Islington train, she\r\nwould not budge an inch until she had been thoroughly posted up. Once\r\nmore in a Tube car, and by way of Old Street, and the City Road, she at\r\nlast arrived at the “Angel,” and felt as if she had indeed reached the\r\ngates of heaven!\r\n\r\nMilner Street was close by, and she was soon at her aunt’s house, but,\r\nalas! not to breakfast, for it was nearing twelve o’clock. That\r\nrelation, an impatient woman, tired of waiting, had gone out for the\r\nday, and had left no message! This was too much for the little woman, it\r\nwas the last straw, and flinging herself on the sofa, she thought\r\nsympathetically of how in the past\r\n\r\n    “A north-country maid up to London had strayed,\r\n       Although with her nature it did not agree;\r\n     She wept and she sighed, and she bitterly cried,\r\n       I wish once again in the north I could be.”\r\n\r\nQuickly she returned to Shepherd’s Bush, _viâ_ the Bank and the Twopenny\r\nTube, in the latter finding a totally different class of people from\r\nthose she had travelled with in the morning, and plenty of room for\r\neverybody. She went back home the next day, sacrificing her seat for the\r\nCoronation procession; and she registered a vow that if ever she came to\r\nLondon again she would study closely the route for any proposed\r\nexpedition as carefully as if she were on an “unaccompanied” Continental\r\ntour.\r\n\r\nShe kept her vow; and, I believe, eventually, her “bump of locality”\r\nbecame considerably developed.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this practically true sketch is, that in view of the\r\ncomplicated system of metropolitan Tubes and Undergrounds, no one\r\nwithout an experienced escort, unless endowed with a talent for\r\nlocality, can hope to get about London without trouble and difficulty.\r\nIn fact, a _Metropolitan Bradshaw_, or _Metropolitan Guide to\r\nUnderground London_ is urgently needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_LONDON’S TANGLED TUBES_\r\n\r\n“Tangled in the fold of dire necessity.”--MILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TANGLE\r\n\r\nTo inflict upon the readers of this book a map of existing and projected\r\nrailways in London would be cruel; and for them to try to master it\r\nwould be torture worthy of the Inquisition, with loss of reason as the\r\ninevitable result.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the lines above and below ground stream inwards from\r\nthe outskirts, after the fashion of the tramways; with this marked\r\ndifference that there is a direct communication from east to west by the\r\nCentral Railway, and an Inner Circle route engirdling the middle portion\r\nof Greater London.\r\n\r\nAs with the tramways, the routes of nearly all these lines appear to\r\nhave been adopted happy-go-luckily. “Here are Highgate, Walthamstow,\r\nBeckenham, Kew, Hendon,” say the promoters; “what we have to do is to\r\nmake a railway from these suburbs, and, somehow or other, get as near\r\nthe metropolitan centres as possible, and dump down our passengers. The\r\nproblem of intercommunication is not our business. We leave that to\r\nothers.” So the lines of the various companies meander away, often by\r\nthe most indirect routes, and finally arrive more or less near their\r\nobjective destinations, Charing Cross, or the Bank of England.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon the Great with prophetic glance could have foreseen London\r\nlinked to distant villages in every direction, these hamlets growing\r\ninto towns, and as population increased, being irresistibly drawn into\r\nGreater London’s maelstrom of brick and mortar, even he would have been\r\nappalled by the problem of how to give ready means of access from one\r\npart to the other. Anticipating railways and electric tubes, he would\r\nprobably, with the marvellous fertility of resource that distinguished\r\nhim, have formulated a plan whereby a given circular space in the\r\nmetropolis would be divided into sections, a mile square, with a station\r\nin the centre and at each corner, so that all within that area would\r\nhave access to a railway, at no point more than half a mile distant, the\r\ntube railways below the surface, and others above, converging at a great\r\ncentral depôt. On reaching the limit of the circle, the lines (that\r\nwould necessarily cross under and over one another) would, by means of\r\nloops, return and keep up a continued circulation of traffic from rim to\r\nrim of the circle, which, as the city grew bigger and bigger, could be\r\nenlarged, and the lines extended, the process continuing _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, would have been an impossibility; the characteristic\r\nBritish love of half measures and of temporising being opposed to any\r\nreally comprehensive and imperial scheme, and local jealousy would not\r\nhave tolerated the necessarily masterful, though wise, domination of a\r\nOne Man Power in carrying out the plan.\r\n\r\nTherefore the great railways and the suburban railways were allowed to\r\ndo pretty much as they liked, as seen in the entire absence of system in\r\napproaching London, and in dealing with its vast traffic.\r\n\r\nTo meet the difficulty a central station has often been mooted, and much\r\ngood would ensue therefrom if it accommodated _all_ the lines.\r\nRecently, in connection with the Great Western Railway, the idea has\r\nbeen revived, and the site of Christ’s Hospital suggested. In fact, it\r\nis an open secret that overture upon overture has been made on the\r\nsubject, but the enormous price demanded by the old school authorities\r\nhas always been the bugbear.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of an Inner Circle Tube, however, linking together all\r\nthe lines, with ramifications to serve the suburbs, worked jointly under\r\na pooling arrangement by the various companies, has commended itself to\r\ncertain experts.\r\n\r\nIt is true that four of the great trunk lines are already connected by\r\nsubways with the Inner Circle Railway--the Great Eastern at Liverpool\r\nStreet; the Great Western at Praed Street; the London, Brighton, and\r\nSouth Coast at Victoria; and the South Eastern and Chatham at Cannon\r\nStreet, Blackfriars, and Victoria. The Brighton Company has already a\r\nsubway connection between London Bridge and the City and South London\r\nTube Station there, and the Mansion House subway will by-and-by be\r\nsimilarly connected with the City and South London Bank Station.\r\n\r\nAlso there are the purely suburban lines to be considered, such as the\r\nSouth London Railway, worked by the Brighton Company; the Metropolitan\r\nExtension, a part of the Chatham Company’s local system; the West London\r\nRailway, which gives a north-to-south connection at Chelsea for several\r\ncompanies; the Hammersmith and City Railway; the Hampstead Junction\r\nRailway (from Willesden to Tottenham); and the local services of the\r\nLondon and North Western; the Great Northern Railway (already committed\r\nto a tube); and the Midland Railway, which, with the Great Northern,\r\nhas access to the south of London, _viâ_ Ludgate Hill.\r\n\r\nBut the matter now engaging public attention is not Subways, but\r\nTubes--how to disentangle the different schemes, and evolve order out of\r\nchaos.\r\n\r\nThe Tubes open for traffic are the Waterloo and City Railway; the City\r\nand South London Railway; Clapham Common to the “Angel,” Islington; and\r\nthe Central London from the Bank to Shepherd’s Bush. While those in\r\nprogress more or less advanced, are the Great Northern and City Railway;\r\nthe Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway; the Bank to Finsbury Park;\r\nthe Baker Street and Waterloo Railway; Paddington to Waterloo, and\r\nthence _viâ_ St. George’s Circus, Southwark, to the Elephant and Castle.\r\n\r\nAll last session members of the House of Commons were, so to speak,\r\noverwhelmed with Tubes.\r\n\r\n    Tubes to the right of them,\r\n    Tubes to the left of them,\r\n    Tubes in front of them,\r\n    Volley’d and thundered!\r\n\r\nBut the Select Committees fared worse, the task before them being even\r\nmore arduous. There were promoters who sought for powers to construct\r\nTubes to cross and recross proposed and existing lines, and even to bore\r\nparallel with others, while some wanted to create isolated and\r\ndisconnected sections, leading apparently nowhere. Petitions and\r\nprotests against the various schemes poured in from innumerable sources;\r\nfrom every quarter petitions in favour were also laid down at their\r\nfeet. Truly, the members of the Committees found that of making many\r\nTubes (as of books) there was no end, and that much railway promoting\r\nwas a weariness of the flesh.\r\n\r\nLong and loud waged the conflict of the various aspirants to bore\r\nthrough the foundations of London. The smaller promoters’ attention\r\nfinally became fixed upon the financial and legislative duel of two\r\nmagnates, each representing a similar and important scheme for joining\r\ntogether the existing unlinked metropolitan tube lines.\r\n\r\nIt was as if through some narrow gorge leading to desirable pasturage,\r\nthe smaller denizens of wood and forest tumultuously endeavoured to\r\nforce a passage, and falling out by the way, their strife was suddenly\r\narrested to watch the single combat of two rival antlered monarchs of\r\nthe glen, who fought to the death to obtain the sole right of way.\r\n\r\nOut of the Parliamentary hurly-burly emerged triumphant the well-known\r\nYerkes group with its comprehensive scheme (the first in the list given\r\nbelow) the only very important one sanctioned.\r\n\r\nThus closed the session of 1902, and in the Railway Committee Rooms, for\r\na time at least, the\r\n\r\n    “Fiery fight is heard no more,\r\n     And the storm has ceased to blow.”\r\n\r\nThe following Tube Railways were authorised:--Brompton and Piccadilly\r\nCircus Railway (Acts 1897, 1899, 1902), that of 1902 authorising _inter\r\nalia_ its amalgamation with the Great Northern and Strand. The Charing\r\nCross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway to be continued to Edgware by a\r\npreviously authorised line (Acts 1893 to 1900 and 1902). The City and\r\nBrixton Railway, to cross the Thames independently of the City and South\r\nLondon Tube, and to have stations at St. George’s Circus, Southwark, and\r\nat Kennington Oval (Act 1897), with a new City station communicating\r\nwith the South London Railway (electric). The Great Northern and City\r\nRailway, Finsbury Park to the Bank. The Metropolitan District Railway\r\n(Act 1897), a Deep-level Electric to work with the Brompton and\r\nPiccadilly Tube. The North West London Railway (Act 1899) from the\r\nMarble Arch to Cricklewood.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL COMMISSION\r\n\r\nFor some time past it had been made clear that no Select Committee of\r\nthe Houses of Parliament, however efficient, could be expected to cope\r\nwith the problem of metropolitan combined tubes, tramways and vehicular\r\nstreet traffic; and in view of the probability of other Tube Bills being\r\npromoted during the session of 1903, it was strongly urged upon the\r\nGovernment to consent to a Royal Commission on the matter.\r\n\r\nSo, before the meeting of this year’s Parliament, a Royal Commission was\r\nappointed with a most comprehensive programme of arduous work.\r\n\r\nGeneral satisfaction seems to have been expressed with the composition\r\nof the Commission. No better chairman could have been found than Sir\r\nDavid M. Barbour, whose acquaintance with official inquiries is probably\r\ngreater than that of anyone else in Great Britain, he having been\r\nassociated with several Royal Commissions. Special knowledge bearing on\r\nthe peculiar problems to be solved, characterises most of the members.\r\nSir John Wolfe Barry is perhaps the best-known consulting railway\r\nengineer in the country, having acted in this capacity to many of the\r\nleading railway companies, and, in 1901, having taken part in the\r\ninquiry respecting vibration on tube railways. Sir George Trout Bartley\r\nhas represented North Islington in the House of Commons for nearly\r\neighteen years, and from lifelong residence in London has a wide\r\nknowledge of its needs. Earl Cawdor has been Chairman of the Great\r\nWestern Railway for the last eight years. Viscount Cobham has been a\r\nRailway Commissioner since 1891, and prior to that, was temporarily\r\nDeputy-Chairman of the Great Western Railway. Sir Joseph Dimsdale, being\r\na banker, has had wide experience as a financier. Ex-Lord Mayor, and\r\nCity Chamberlain, he represents in the House of Commons the City of\r\nLondon, which is vitally concerned in the question of efficient transit.\r\nMr. G. S. Gibb, the General Manager of the North Eastern Railway for the\r\npast twelve years, is a railway expert of great experience. As Permanent\r\nSecretary of the Board of Trade, Sir Francis J. S. Hopwood has a\r\nspecially trained mind, and an intimate acquaintance with railway\r\nmatters, having been formerly Secretary of the Railway Department. Mr.\r\nC. S. Murdoch, C.B., has been for many years in the Government service,\r\nand has acted, since 1896, as Assistant Under-Secretary of the Home\r\nDepartment. Sir John P. Dickson-Poynder is a member for the Chippenham\r\nDivision of Wiltshire, and represents St. George’s, Hanover Square, at\r\nthe County Council. Sir Robert T. Reid, K.C., member for Dumfries since\r\n1886, was Attorney-General in the last Liberal Government, and may be\r\nregarded as the official representative of the Opposition on the\r\nCommission. Lord Ribblesdale, a member of the London County Council, was\r\nChairman of the Joint Committee of the Lords and Commons on Tube\r\nRailways in 1901.\r\n\r\nSoon after the appointment of the Commission it was suggested that the\r\nlabour would be considerably lightened if the subject of pedestrian and\r\nvehicular traffic included in their programme were eliminated or, at any\r\nrate, indefinitely postponed, and attention concentrated upon Tubes and\r\nRailways, making--as they have the power to do--an interim report; and\r\nthus avert disastrous delay in the realisation of the Tube Schemes\r\nbefore the Parliament of 1903.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session a somewhat significant announcement was made in the\r\nHouse of Commons, in reference to these schemes; only two of which were\r\nvery important, viz., the Central London’s proposal to complete the\r\ncircle; and the North-East London Railway scheme, which (if passed) will\r\nembrace twenty-two miles--nine being in tubes--tapping the traffic\r\nbetween the City and Leyton and Walthamstow, whose combined population\r\nis over two hundred thousand people.\r\n\r\nThe following is the statement made on the 2nd of March by Mr. Jeffreys,\r\nas Deputy-Chairman of Committees, who said he had had the advantage of a\r\nconference with the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords and the\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade, and they had come to the conclusion\r\nthat certain of the bills connected with London traffic ought to be\r\npostponed until the result of the Commission dealing with this matter\r\nhad been reported. The deep-level railways which they thought ought to\r\nawait the completion of this inquiry were the Central London Railway;\r\nGreat Northern, Piccadilly, and Brompton (New Lines and Extensions)\r\nBill; North-West London (Marble Arch to Victoria) Railway Bill; Clapham\r\nJunction to Marble Arch Railway (Nos. 1 and 2) Bill; Metropolitan\r\nDistrict Railway Works Bill. There were certain other Bills which they\r\nthought might go to Committees, viz.: Charing Cross, Euston, and\r\nHampstead Railway Bill; Great Northern, Piccadilly, and Brompton Railway\r\n(Various Powers) Bill; Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Transfer Bill;\r\nand the City and North-East Suburban Electric Railway Bill.\r\n\r\nThere were, besides, certain other railway measures which were doubtful,\r\nand these, they thought, ought to be held over until the Chairman of\r\nCommittees of the House of Lords, the President of the Board of Trade,\r\nand himself had considered them. These Bills were the City and South\r\nLondon Railway (Angel and Islington) Bill, and the Metropolitan District\r\nRailway (Various Powers Bill).\r\n\r\nBut the Royal Commission is, after all, only a temporary expedient; and\r\nthe question remains, as to what shall be the Governing Power of\r\nLondon’s railway traffic; for it must be taken for granted that both the\r\nCity Corporation and the London County Council frankly admit that the\r\nunderground locomotion of the metropolis has become so complicated that\r\nthe general supervision of some great public department is necessary. Is\r\nit to be the London County Council, the Board of Trade, some new body\r\nresembling the Light Railways Commission, or a joint committee of\r\nmembers of both Houses of Parliament, appointed each session, to\r\nconsider all questions affecting locomotion in or near London?\r\n\r\nHere we are reminded that the London County Council has been considering\r\nwhether or not to apply for parliamentary powers to take over the burden\r\nof linking together the various districts of London by a series of\r\ntubes. A colossal undertaking, involving, it is said, a capital of fifty\r\nmillions!\r\n\r\nWhether it be advisable for the Council, in addition to its other heavy\r\nresponsibilities, to extend its municipal trading on so vast a scale, is\r\ndoubtful; for it has the ratepayers to consider.\r\n\r\nIf it be the fact that mercantile enterprise cannot grapple with the\r\ntask, then there would be good and sufficient reason for the Council or\r\nthe Government to attempt it. But private capital is generally\r\nobtainable for a really promising scheme.\r\n\r\nBesides, such gigantic undertakings obviously require men of good\r\nbusiness capacity and considerable railway experience to devote their\r\ntime exclusively to the work. One would think that county councillors\r\n(as such), efficient as they may be, have already as much work as they\r\ncan readily get through, from one week’s end to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_LONDON’S LATEST AND LONGEST TUBE_\r\n\r\n“Green pastures and Piccadilly.”--W. BLACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSanctioned by the Legislature as one of the most comprehensive schemes\r\nlaid before it last year for linking together existing underground, as\r\nwell as trunk, lines, the Great Northern, Piccadilly, and Brompton\r\nRailway, now under construction, has attracted such universal attention,\r\nand traverses such hitherto exclusive quarters, that it deserves more\r\nthan a passing reference.\r\n\r\nFrom a traveller’s point of view, the effect of this new railway will be\r\nfar-reaching. Dwellers near District Railway termini, such as Wimbledon,\r\nNew Cross, Bow Road, South Harrow, Hounslow Barracks, Richmond, and\r\nintermediate stations, will have, by means of exchange--at Earl’s Court\r\nStation with the Metropolitan District Railway; at Gloucester Road and\r\nSouth Kensington Station with the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District\r\nRailway; at Piccadilly Circus Station with the Baker Street and Waterloo\r\nRailway; at Cranbourn Street Station with the Charing Cross, Euston, and\r\nHampstead Railway; and at King’s Cross and Finsbury Park Stations with\r\nthe Great Northern Railway--ready access to practically all centres and\r\nquarters of our big city; its own immediate objective from Earl’s Court\r\nbeing Finsbury Park, a distance of 7½ miles. It is similar in\r\nconstruction to the Central. The cars, built at Loughborough, will\r\nresemble those of the new Inner Circle, and the driving force will come\r\nfrom the Power House at Chelsea.\r\n\r\nTruly, under pleasant scenes will the new Tube be carried--as\r\nfashionable, romantic, and historical a route as any in London. Here is\r\nEarl’s Court, where, in the midst of market gardens far away from town,\r\nonce stood John Hunter’s house, where the great anatomist kept a\r\nmenagerie of wild beasts to experiment upon, and in the dead of night\r\nboiled down the body of O’Brien, the Irish giant, to obtain the\r\nskeleton, which now adorns the museum of the College of Surgeons. The\r\nwell-known Edmund Tattersall lived close by for many years at Coleherne\r\nCourt, on the site of one of either Fairfax’s or Lord Essex’s redoubts\r\n(they appear to have had a good many), thrown up after the battle of\r\nBrentford, when the victorious Royalists were expected to cross the\r\nriver (which they never did) and besiege London.\r\n\r\nGloucester Road, the next station, recalls the fact that when the\r\nDistrict Railway came there, it was still a mere lane with hawthorn\r\nhedges, a blacksmith’s forge somewhere near, while pleasant paths right\r\nand left led to orchards, in the midst of which was St. Jude’s Church,\r\nso famous later on for its fashionable congregation and its eloquent\r\npreacher, the Rev. Dr. Forrest, now Dean of Worcester.\r\n\r\nFrom Gloucester Road the Tube runs under pleasant Stanhope Gardens and\r\npart of Harrington Road with its fine mansions, to South Kensington. The\r\nground about the Hoop and Toy Tavern close by was, so tradition says,\r\ndesignated in the draft Parliamentary Bill for the Great Western\r\nRailway terminus. At that time the site was sufficiently countrified to\r\nsatisfy those who would banish railway stations to Jericho or to the\r\nuttermost verge of London, and remained so for a long time; and I have\r\nbeen told by an old Bromptonian that he has seen a covey of partridges\r\nput up where the Natural History Museum now stands.\r\n\r\nAt this point the new Tube--leaving its course parallel with, but at a\r\nfar deeper level than, the District Railway--proceeds unaccompanied to\r\nPiccadilly, and, so to say, enters the Brompton Road at the Oratory of\r\nSt. Philip Neri, formerly a very plain brick edifice erected by the\r\nOratorian Fathers, who had begun their good work on a humble scale in\r\nKing William Street, Charing Cross, in a building subsequently occupied\r\nby Woodin, the ventriloquist, and later on by Toole, as his own peculiar\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\nThe present conspicuous basilica is at last completed, all but the\r\ntowers. Adjoining it, down an avenue of trees, recalling the approach to\r\nShakespeare’s last resting-place, is Holy Trinity Church, Brompton,\r\nreminiscent of Dr. Irons, its vicar, who ultimately became Rector of St.\r\nMary Woolnoth, beneath which is the City station of the City and South\r\nLondon Electric Railway.\r\n\r\nBrompton Square is close by, associated by many of us with a once\r\npopular song, “Ada with the golden hair,” composed and sung by G. W.\r\nMoore, of the Christy Minstrels. In this Square have dwelt many actors\r\nand actresses: Wigan, Buckstone, Robert Keeley, etc.; and also Shirley\r\nBrooks. At one corner used to be a house standing a little back from the\r\nroad, occupied by an eccentric individual whose craze was to have\r\nseveral clocks in every room, and the task of keeping them in order\r\nencouraged a watch-and-clock-maker to settle down in a small shop next\r\ndoor. Another feature of his craze was to present a watch of some kind\r\nto every lady he knew; so that his neighbour must have done a fair\r\nbusiness. A bank now occupies this site, and the author recollects\r\nwatching the strong-room being built deep down in the gravelly soil\r\npeculiar to South Kensington. Next door will be located the\r\nunpretentious Brompton Station of the new railway. An official of the\r\nbank was heard to remark facetiously that he trusted the Tube would not\r\nbore into the strong-room aforesaid--a new possibility and grievance to\r\nbe duly noted.\r\n\r\nDirectly underneath Brompton Road goes London’s latest Tube, passing\r\n“Harrod’s,” the most palatial General Store in the metropolis, if not in\r\nthe world. It originated some years ago in a narrow little shop, where\r\ngood tea, excellent butter, and, rumour says, jam made by Mr. Harrod’s\r\nmother, were the chief articles sold to the customers, the bulk of whom\r\nwere of the working-class.\r\n\r\nNow Knightsbridge is reached, in olden times called Kingsbridge, when it\r\nwas represented by a bridge only (on the site of the modern Albert\r\nGate), built by Edward the Confessor over a brook, or bourn, rising,\r\nlike the Tybourn and the Oldbourn, in the Hampstead Hills, and flowing\r\nthence to the Thames.\r\n\r\nNo part of London has so completely changed in appearance as this; lofty\r\nmodern buildings having taken the place of small old-fashioned houses.\r\nThese improvements culminate at Sloane Street, where anyone approaching\r\ntown by way of Kensington, meets the first of the numerous metropolitan\r\n“rond-points,” surrounded by mansions and shops so tall as to put into\r\nthe shade the French Embassy and the houses at Albert Gate, which for\r\nmany years were considered the highest in town. At the equestrian\r\nstatue of Field-Marshal Lord Strathnairn, four thoroughfares\r\nconverge--Kensington Road, Brompton Road, Sloane Street, and St.\r\nGeorge’s Place--pouring around it a continual stream of traffic day and\r\nnight. Three of these thoroughfares are perfect paradises to ladies who\r\ndelight in such alluring shops as Harrod’s, Harvey Nichols and Co., and\r\nWoolland Brothers, whose prolonged and magnificent frontages are\r\nunequalled in Modern Babylon.\r\n\r\nA few doors from the “rond-point” in Brompton Road is a Tube station;\r\nand the workmen, as they bore close to the triangular grass-covered\r\nenclosure in front of Tattersall’s, are probably unaware that a\r\ncomparatively slight deviation would take them through a pit beneath the\r\nenclosure, which, tradition avers, was used, during the Great Plague of\r\nLondon, for the dead. It is likely enough; for centuries ago there\r\nexisted, a little to the east of Albert Gate, a hospital belonging to\r\nthe Dean and Chapter of Westminster, which in 1665 was given up for the\r\nuse of infected patients; and as this little piece of ground has never\r\nbeen disturbed, it probably was originally the burying-place attached\r\nto the hospital, and was converted into a plague-pit.\r\n\r\nA house close to Hyde Park Court was once occupied by Charles Reade, the\r\nnovelist. At a house close by (long since pulled down), Horace Smith,\r\njoint-author of _Rejected Addresses_, lived from 1810 to 1818, and drove\r\nhimself daily to and from the City--he was then a stockbroker--in a\r\nvehicle called a “whisky.” A little farther on, where the London and\r\nCounty Bank is dwarfed by the late Sir Herbert Naylor Leyland’s great\r\nmansion, used to stand the “Fox and Bull,” a quaint old tavern dating\r\nback to Queen Elizabeth’s time, and a favourite resort of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds, George Morland, and other painters. Holy Trinity Chapel, St.\r\nGeorge’s Place, no longer wedged in between two public-houses, replaces\r\nan old church where the celebrated Prime Minister--then plain Robert\r\nWalpole--was married in 1700 to a Lord Mayor’s daughter, who became the\r\nmother of Sir Horace Walpole. In St. George’s Place, where it faces the\r\nPark--surely one of the most desirable of situations, the first\r\nintimation that we are approaching “Green pastures and Piccadilly”--is\r\nthe Hyde Park Corner Station of the new railway, next door to No. 8,\r\nconspicuous as the residence of the Baden-Powell family, on the site of\r\nwhich house, in an old-fashioned tenement, lived for many years John\r\nListon, the comedian identified with the character of “Paul Pry.” Being\r\nfreehold--a unique feature in the neighbourhood--this small plot of\r\nground has cost the Company dear. It had to pay £30,750 for its\r\nacquisition.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to believe that at this point London once terminated,\r\nLanesborough House, where St. George’s Hospital stands, being described\r\nin Pennant’s days as a “country mansion,” and thus it remained until\r\nlittle more than a century ago. While in the time of Charles the Second,\r\nnear Hamilton Place was an inn, bearing the sign of the “Hercules\r\nPillars,” signifying that, like the “First and Last House” at Land’s\r\nEnd, no habitation existed beyond it.\r\n\r\nAll sorts and conditions of people, mostly distinguished, live, and have\r\nlived, along this part of the route, which has its Tube stations at Down\r\nStreet and Dover Street. There is Apsley House, and next to it Baron\r\nRothschild’s mansion. At No. 1 Hamilton\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. THE WESTERN APPROACH TO PICCADILLY.]\r\n\r\nPlace lived the great Lord Chancellor Eldon. From 139, Piccadilly (Lord\r\nGlenesk’s) Lady Byron, after one of her quarrels with the poet, fled\r\nwith her infant daughter. At Nos. 138 and 139, formerly one building,\r\nthe Marquis of Queensbury (the notorious “Old Q.”) used, when an\r\noctogenarian, to sit at a certain window for hours, and ogle the passing\r\nfair sex. Gloucester House adjoining, is the residence of the Duke of\r\nCambridge, occupied, when it was Elgin House, by the Earl of Elgin, who\r\nbrought over to England the famous marbles that bear his name. Nearly\r\nopposite Down Street, on the park side of Piccadilly, stands a curious\r\nreminder that once upon a time, parcels and packages of all kinds had to\r\nbe conveyed all over London, not by train or by Carter Paterson’s speedy\r\nvans, but on the shoulders of stalwart porters. It is a “bulk,”\r\nreplacing an old timber one. A “bulk,” it may be explained, is a kind of\r\nshelf supported by two posts at a convenient height for the bearers of\r\nburdens to temporarily dispose of them and rest awhile. On the site of\r\nNo. 106 (the St. James’s Club) was formerly the “Greyhound,” a very old\r\ninn, which, with the “White Horse” close by, and the “Half Moon,” a\r\nlittle further on, was a favourite pulling-up place for the numerous\r\ncarriers, tranters, and market-gardeners who were incessantly coming\r\nfrom the country to town; for Piccadilly was one of London’s great\r\nhighways westward. In a house (now a club) at the corner of White Horse\r\nStreet, Sir Walter Scott sometimes stayed when in town. Cambridge House\r\n(the Naval and Military Club) recalls Lord Palmerston and the notable\r\npolitical receptions of his accomplished wife. At the corner of Clarges\r\nStreet, where lived Edmund Kean and also Lady Hamilton, is the Turf\r\nClub, and at No. 84 the Imperial Service Club, the last of Piccadilly’s\r\nline of clubs that, commencing with The Bachelors’, at the corner of\r\nHamilton Place, forms a kind of approach to the real club-land of St.\r\nJames’s Street and Pall Mall. Bath House, at the corner of Bolton\r\nStreet, was the residence of the late millionaire, Baron Hirsch. No. 80,\r\nPiccadilly, and No. 1, Stratton Street together form the town house of\r\nthe Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and it was from No. 80 that her father, Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett, M.P., was, in 1810, amidst serious rioting, taken to\r\nthe Tower for having made use of bad language in the House of Commons.\r\nFrom the roof can be obtained a splendid view of the Westminster and\r\nPimlico district, across the Park, rightly called “Green,” with its\r\nbeautiful stretches of turf and graceful trees, and far away to the\r\nSurrey Hills and the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nDevonshire House, seen through its fine old iron gates--brought here\r\nfrom Chiswick--is plain enough externally, but its saloons are very\r\nhandsome, and here the lovely Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, reigned\r\nas Queen of Fashion long ago. Arlington Street reminds us of the Marquis\r\nof Salisbury, of Earl Nelson, who lodged here, and of Sir Horace Walpole\r\nand his father. In Albemarle Street, Percy Bysshe Shelley once had\r\nquarters at Cooke’s Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe Tube now carries its passengers ninety feet below the beautiful\r\nPiccadilly shops, past St. James’s Street and Bond Street, the\r\nBurlington Arcade and Burlington House, past the Egyptian Hall, past\r\nFortnum and Mason’s--so universally associated with hampers, long-necked\r\nbottles, and race-meetings; past the Albany, where lived Byron, Lytton,\r\nand Lord Macaulay; past the Prince’s Restaurant, and its neighbour, St.\r\nJames’s Church, where there are some splendid specimens of Grinling\r\nGibbons’ wood-carving, and where, in 1762, occurred a singular thing. In\r\nsome unexplained manner the vaults caught fire, and two hundred coffins\r\nwith their inmates underwent an uncontemplated process of cremation;\r\npast St. James’s Hall opposite (eventually to be enlarged and converted\r\nto purposes other than harmony only). And now Piccadilly Circus, where\r\nsix roads meet, and where, next to Spiers and Pond’s Restaurant, is the\r\nPiccadilly Circus Station of this, the longest Tube. Subways should\r\ncertainly be arranged for access to this station, to avoid the very\r\ndangerous crossings from each of the six roads. Why does not the London\r\nCounty Council, emulating the City Fathers and their Mansion House\r\nsubterranean passages, undertake this beneficent work in the West End?\r\n\r\nWe are now in the region of music-halls, theatres, cafés, dining-places,\r\nand Scott’s, the famous shell-fish shop.\r\n\r\n“What is the origin of the name _Piccadilly_?” is a question asked again\r\nand again. It is difficult to decide. Was it from the ruffs called\r\n“peckadils” (from the Spanish _pica_), whose stiffened points were like\r\ndiminutive spearheads, worn by the mashers or dudes of the early\r\nCarolean period, who gathered here at a gaming-house, Piccadilly Hall?\r\nOr was it, as Pennant thought, from the “piccadills” (cakes) which may\r\nhave been sold in the surrounding fields? Who in the year 1903 can\r\ndecide?\r\n\r\nHere I pause. The rest of the new Tube’s route to Stamford Hill is\r\nuseful but prosaic, and none of the remaining ten stations, except\r\nCranbourn Street, Covent Garden, and Holborn are surrounded with any\r\nremarkably interesting associations, either historical or modern.\r\n\r\nFrom South Kensington to Piccadilly this railway is certainly an\r\naristocratic one. Daintily-clad ladies will, doubtless, use it largely\r\nfor shopping and paying visits. The rank and fashion of London will\r\npatronise it. Countesses, marchionesses, even duchesses, may condescend\r\nto travel by it; nay, royalty may even give it a trial! Nobody would be\r\nsurprised to see its booking-office æsthetically designed; the officials\r\nwell-groomed and decorous as bank clerks; the lifts luxuriously\r\nupholstered with seats for all; the _cars-de-luxe_ (for which an extra\r\ncharge would be made) beautifully decorated, warmed in winter and\r\ndelightfully cooled during summer heats, with fresh flowers provided,\r\nand perfumes sprayed at intervals to remove the least trace of bad\r\nsmell; copies of the _Court Guide_ and the most fashionable magazines at\r\nthe disposal of the passengers; umbrella and parasol stands; special and\r\ncomfortable quarters for pet dogs; the smoking-cars models of elegance\r\nand comfort; and the guards’ uniform scarlet and gold.\r\n\r\nSeriously, however, is there or is there not, “one little rift within\r\nthe lute”? Will the size of the tunnels--11½ feet in diameter--suffice\r\nfor maintaining an equable and pure atmosphere throughout the year?\r\nDoubtless it will; for special attention has been given to this matter\r\nby the distinguished consulting engineer, and inlets for fresh, and\r\nup-cast shafts for foul air, together with fans worked by machinery,\r\nwill be liberally provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_ELECTRIC TRAMWAYS GENERALLY_\r\n\r\n“And I have taken away your horses.”--AMOS iv. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\nNearly fifty years ago there arrived in this country an enterprising\r\ncitizen of the United States bearing the name of George Francis Train,\r\nwith whom will always be associated the first attempt to introduce\r\ntramways into Great Britain.\r\n\r\nLike many other innovators, Train was ahead of his time, and after\r\nvainly struggling against indifference, and, in London, against the\r\nstrongest opposition voiced by the Chief Commissioner of Works, he\r\nreturned home a wiser and a sadder man, having failed to launch his\r\ngreat enterprise.\r\n\r\nNot unreasonably he complained that his system had not been given a fair\r\ntrial, and that his nationality was against him, pointing out that in\r\nIreland he had, on the contrary, received sympathy and encouragement\r\nfrom the fact that he was an American.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, his ideas were immature, and his tram-lines utterly\r\nunsuited to the street traffic of great cities.\r\n\r\nHis first attempt was at Birkenhead, in 1860; and three years later he\r\nlaid down a line, four miles long, from Hanley to Burslem, in\r\nStaffordshire, and also a short one at Darlington. In the year 1861 he\r\nconstructed a line from the Marble Arch along the Uxbridge Road, and\r\nanother from Westminster Bridge to Kennington Park. The track was\r\nballasted, not paved, and the macadam very soon “rutted” on each side of\r\nthe rail; but the worst feature was that the tread of the rail being an\r\ninch below the road surface, the wheels of vehicles were seriously\r\ninjured and sometimes wrenched clean off as they endeavoured to leave\r\nthe lines.\r\n\r\nA tremendous agitation ensued against the tramway system. Train’s rails\r\nwere compulsorily taken up, and his ideas were dismissed as\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nYet the bread had been cast upon the waters, destined to be found much\r\nlater on, but not by George Francis Train. For ten years after the\r\nBirkenhead line was laid down, tramways remained in a very primitive\r\ncondition, the sole aim being to obtain a smooth track, and so lessen\r\nthe wear and tear caused by the uneven macadam. The rolling-stock was\r\ncrude in the extreme, and the rails were fastened down to longitudinal\r\nsleepers, so that the spikes invariably worked up, but this defect was\r\nremedied when steel girders came into use. The trams were, of course,\r\ndrawn by horses, for until 1880 no better means of traction appears to\r\nhave been thought of. Nobody was a bit interested in the tramways, and\r\ncarriage-folk detested them, so they were banished to the outskirts of\r\nthe City and “over the water.”\r\n\r\nThe West End recognised them not, except to sign petitions against their\r\nintroduction. The “poor man’s street railway,” it affirmed, must keep\r\nits proper place in the south, the far north, and the far east of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIt was left to private enterprise to run the lines, and practically\r\nfour companies--the North Metropolitan, the London Street Tramways, the\r\nSouth London Company, and the London Tramways Company--monopolised the\r\nbusiness, there being no enterprising London County Council to compete\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS METHODS OF HAULAGE\r\n\r\nFor a decade--up to 1890--all kinds of improved methods of haulage were\r\ntried: compressed air, coiled springs, underground cables (a well-known\r\nexample of which was the Highgate line, which was always breaking down),\r\nand, lastly, gas traction and steam traction.\r\n\r\nTo all these methods there are serious objections. Horse traction is\r\nexpensive, besides being distressingly trying to the animals themselves.\r\nIt is necessary to keep up a large stud for each car, and the horses\r\nwhen idle are eating their heads off. Their fullest speed with the heavy\r\ncars is necessarily low. Starting is a slow process, and at the best the\r\nrate of progress (including stoppages) does not exceed four miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nCompressed air and coiled springs may both be consigned to pigeon-holes,\r\nlabelled respectively “doubtful” and “impossible,” there being of the\r\nformer scarcely half a dozen examples in Great Britain, though in\r\nAmerica it is said to have worked well and on an extensive scale.\r\n\r\nCable traction has many advantages, and for a long time was successfully\r\nadopted in America, but is now abandoned. With the funicular system, in\r\nvogue in Edinburgh, Birmingham, Paris, and Melbourne, travellers have\r\nlong been familiar. Where a large number of cars are employed, it has\r\nthe advantage of cheapness in working, and the machinery does not easily\r\nget out of order. But the initial cost is very heavy, and it is not\r\nsuitable for complicated lines, or for tramways with several branches;\r\nand therefore extensions, unless straight, are almost impracticable,\r\nthough it is superior to all others, save that of electricity, for very\r\nsevere gradients. As the cable moves at a uniform rate, a car can\r\nneither vary its speed nor reverse its course. Then there is a\r\ndifficulty in dealing with the gas and water-pipes during construction\r\n(that is, if they are near the surface), and the conduit forms a\r\nreceptacle for street refuse, and becomes insanitary. But the chief\r\ndefect is that three-fourths of the total power required to haul the\r\ncars is absorbed in driving the cable.\r\n\r\nOn a small scale, and with but little success, gas traction has been\r\nrecently tried. There is a difficulty in starting the engines, therefore\r\nthey have to work continuously, which causes the unpleasant noise\r\nfamiliarised to us by petrol-driven motor-cars when standing still.\r\nThere is a decided smell from the “exhaust” of the engine; the vibration\r\nis considerable; and, as at present designed, the cars cannot mount a\r\nmoderately steep hill.\r\n\r\nSteam traction has been in use for some time, but has not improved, and\r\nis not popular. Great wear and tear of the track is caused by the weight\r\nof the locomotive, and the public object to the long intervals of\r\nservice, consequent upon the necessity, for economical reasons, of using\r\nlarge cars. Steam involves sulphurous gases and general dirtiness,\r\nbesides the apprehension, fanciful or real, of an occasional “blow up.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS METHODS OF ELECTRIC TRAMWAY TRACTION\r\n\r\nDismissing all these systems, we turn to electricity, as admittedly the\r\nbest agent for tramway traction, and, until some marvellous discovery\r\ndisplaces it as a force, likely to remain and to become universally\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nBlackpool was first in the field with an electric tramway in 1883.\r\nSeveral other provincial districts followed suit, including Bristol and\r\nStockton-on-Tees. London, in 1900, welcomed the completion of Mr. J.\r\nClifton Robinson’s great scheme for electrifying that portion of the\r\nLondon United Tramways running between Hammersmith and Kew.\r\n\r\nThe year 1903 sees metropolitan and suburban electric trams in every\r\ndirection; while in the provinces they will soon cover the face of the\r\nland, so extraordinarily rapid has been their acceptance. On every hand\r\nsigns are evinced of the direct influence upon the general prosperity,\r\ncomfort, and pleasure of all classes of people by a cheap and rapid\r\nelectric tramway service.\r\n\r\nThe electric system admits of an easy extension of routes, and is of all\r\nsystems the simplest to work. The cars can be readily backed or diverted\r\nin any direction. They are roomy, clean, well lighted and ventilated,\r\nand, if necessary, can be heated; the seats are comfortable; and the\r\nspeed is double that of horses, while, without any fuss, gradients of 1\r\nin 8 can be tackled. Of its popularity none can doubt, especially in hot\r\nweather, when exhausted town-dwellers swarm on the roof of the cars for\r\na breath of fresh air as they travel merrily along at the rate of twelve\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nExisting tramways can be adapted to this system with rapidity, and all\r\nexperts bear testimony to the fact that electric haulage is\r\ncomparatively so cheap, and the development of traffic on its adoption\r\nso great, that horse traction has no chance against it.\r\n\r\nThere are four kinds of electric-tramway traction which, though\r\napparently rather puzzling, are readily explained. These are the\r\nConduit; the Surface Contact; the Overhead (or trolley); in each of\r\nwhich the current is conveyed to the line--as in an electric\r\nrailway--from a power house; and the Accumulator, or Self-contained Car,\r\nthe motive power being obtained from storage batteries carried on the\r\ncar itself, and these supply the current direct to the motor on the car.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. TRAM-CAR IN PARIS EQUIPPED FOR COMBINED OVERHEAD\r\nTROLLEY AND SURFACE CONTACT SYSTEM\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Dolter Electric Traction Co., Ltd., London_]\r\n\r\nIn the conduit system the main conductors (or feed-wire), always in this\r\ncountry placed underground, are carried in a conduit or tube under the\r\ntrack, which has a narrow longitudinal slit on its upper surface level\r\nwith the road. Through this slit passes a bracket carried by the car in\r\nsuch a manner as to make contact with the two conduit-conductors. The\r\nobjections to this system are the heavy cost of construction, its\r\nliability to derangement from floods, the expense of cleaning the\r\nconduits, and its tendency to accumulate filth.\r\n\r\nThe closed conduit, or surface contact system, consists of a series of\r\nplates or studs placed along the track a few feet apart and flush with\r\nthe road, and insulated from each other. Under ordinary circumstances\r\nthese are disconnected with the conductor, which is laid entirely below\r\nthe surface, but when a car passes over them they become, by means of\r\nswitches, automatically connected with it, so that the current can be\r\nconveyed through them to the car motors. In other words, the studs are\r\n“alive” while the car is over them, and “dead” as soon as it has passed.\r\nThis is a very practicable method, and in certain cases is preferable to\r\nthe open conduit. Defects, however, there are, but the Dolter apparatus\r\nclaims to have overcome them, and it is greatly in its favour that the\r\nsystem has been successfully worked in Paris for more than two years. It\r\nhas the merit of readily lending itself to a combination with the\r\noverhead trolley system.\r\n\r\nOf all systems, by far the best known to the public is that of\r\n“overhead,” recognised immediately by the tall iron poles inseparable\r\nfrom its adoption. Ninety-five per cent. of the world’s electric\r\ntramways are worked on the overhead principle. The distribution of\r\nelectric energy is by means of a wire, called the trolley wire, upheld\r\nby insulated brackets on poles twenty feet above the ground, along the\r\nentire track, which is divided into sections, each section taking its\r\ncurrent from the main conductor-wire, which is laid underground, through\r\nthe iron poles. Should any one section of the trolley wires meet with\r\nmishap, only the cars working on that section are stopped; those on the\r\nremaining divisions, having an independent source of current, continue\r\nto run\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. CROSS LANE JUNCTION, SALFORD. THE LARGEST AND\r\nMOST COMPLICATED OVERHEAD TROLLEY CROSSING IN THE KINGDOM\r\n\r\n_By permission of_ _Geo. Hill & Co., Manchester_]\r\n\r\nwithout interruption. At the upper end is a small deeply grooved wheel\r\nwhich, by means of springs at the base of the trolley pole, is pressed\r\nagainst the under side of the trolley wire overhead, and in that\r\nposition remains as the car proceeds. From the wire the electric current\r\npasses through the grooved wheel and down the trolley pole to the\r\nmotors, of which there is one at each end of the car.\r\n\r\nIn all three systems the motor itself is suspended from the axle, which\r\nit turns; and the armature of the motor is parallel to the axle and\r\nnearest to the centre of the car. On the end of the armature is a small\r\ncogwheel which gears into the teeth of a larger wheel keyed to the axle,\r\nand this turns round the wheels of the car. A coiled spring supports the\r\nfield-magnet of the motor, and when the driver turns the lever on to the\r\ntop of the controller (which is a high box in front of each platform\r\ncontaining a series of wires connected with the motor), and switches on\r\nthe current, the motor is lifted up on the first revolution of the\r\narmature, the coiled spring takes up the motion of the motor, and\r\nprevents the car starting with a jerk. The current, when done with,\r\nreturns to the source of supply by the ordinary tram rails, which are\r\nspecially connected at the joints for this purpose. It is maintained\r\nthat for cheapness of construction, simplicity of operation, reliability\r\nin action, and flexibility in adaptation, this method is superior to all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThere was at one time a certain objection to it on æsthetic grounds. The\r\nearlier examples, when clumsy wooden posts and festoons of wire\r\nobstructed the view and seemed to choke up the street, undoubtedly\r\njustified the protest against the “overhead”; but now that slender iron\r\npoles, ornamental rather than otherwise, and, in some cases, rosettes\r\nattached to the houses, are used for the suspension of the trolley wire,\r\npeople have become reconciled to the appearance of the thoroughfares,\r\nand no longer object to the apparatus.\r\n\r\nOne more system, an ideal one, remains to be considered. It is that of\r\nthe “Self-contained Car,” which carries a battery of secondary cells,\r\nwhence the current for working the motors is taken as required. But, for\r\nthe present, there are serious obstacles against its general\r\napplication. The great weight of the accumulators leads to a\r\ndisproportionate consumption of power, and involves heavy expenditure on\r\nthe permanent way and in rolling-stock. The batteries must be recharged\r\nat frequent intervals, and must either be removed from the car--a\r\ntroublesome process--or the car must be kept idle while the cells are\r\nrevivified. Accumulators as a rule do not live long, and have to be\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nThus the working expenses are so heavy that, ideal as the system is, and\r\ndelightful the smooth running of the cars, it does not pay commercially\r\nto adopt it, and we must wait patiently in the hope that one day a\r\nperfect and practical secondary battery will appear on the scenes. Great\r\nimprovements in lightness and durability are in the air.\r\n\r\nTramcars have become luxurious compared with the makeshifts that did\r\nduty in George Francis Train’s day, and each new line endeavours to make\r\nits rolling-stock superior to the others. Some cars are double-decked,\r\n_i.e._ have seats outside; some are single-decked, _i.e._ have no\r\noutside seats. They are roomy and comfortably upholstered, and the\r\nwindows are curtained, or provided with louvre shutters to keep the sun\r\nout. Those of the London United Tramways are models of comfort, and\r\npeople who recollect only the early examples, mostly of foreign\r\nconstruction, would be surprised at the advance made. They seat thirty\r\ninside and thirty-nine outside passengers, have spring cushions covered\r\nwith plush moquette, and ceilings panelled in bird’s-eye maple. There\r\nare electric push-buttons for signalling the motor-man; electric light\r\nis provided, and ventilators extend the whole length of the car,\r\nensuring an abundant supply of fresh air.\r\n\r\nNo cars, however, in Great Britain have reached the pitch of perfection\r\nattained in America by the palace and parlour tramcars; the former\r\nfitted up like a Pullman, with little tables and easy-chairs, and\r\nwindows prettily curtained. Of this type, perhaps the most superb is in\r\nBuenos Ayres. Decorated in early French style, it is beautifully\r\nfinished; while inside it resembles a drawing-room, with windows\r\nseparated by carved pilasters and draperies of white silk and gold\r\ndamask. A fine Wilton carpet covers the parquetry floor, whereon stand\r\nwoven cane fauteuils with gold plush seats. At each end of the car is a\r\nbuffet, and one of the platforms is provided with an ice chest, while an\r\nelectric heater produces tea and coffee when required.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this chapter introducing the subject of tramways, without\r\nreference to the “Rush for the Trams” that attracted so much attention\r\nlast year. The rushes in the Blackfriars Bridge Road began shortly after\r\nfive o’clock and continued until seven p.m., and were described in the\r\ndaily journals as follows: “South London, thanks to the L.C.C., rejoices\r\nin an excellent tram service. There are many trams going everywhere\r\nwithin a reasonable distance--Streatham, Greenwich, Tooting, New Cross.\r\nNow, however hard or however fast you rush at a tram, it is not to be\r\nbullied into holding more than a certain number. If, however, you rush\r\nsufficiently fiercely and with sufficient violence, you may either\r\nknock or frighten out of the way a girl who has been waiting longer than\r\nyou. Some genius discovered this and rushed; others, not to be beaten,\r\nrushed also. The result is that every evening the Blackfriars Road is\r\nthe scene of a savage fight for the incoming trams, where men and women\r\nmeet in unequal strife.... All notions of chivalry, of ‘ladies first,’\r\nare thrown to the winds, apparently, on these occasions, with the result\r\nthat many young girls, weak women and children, rather than share in the\r\nunequal strife, are content to walk all the way home.... Long before the\r\ntrams arrive at the starting-point, they are boarded at either end, and\r\na jovial crowd, knocking off one another’s hats, poking out one\r\nanother’s eyes, swarms on to them. As an entertainment, this is not\r\nwithout merit; as an exhibition of the passions, it is undoubtedly\r\ninteresting. But if you happen to be weak or a woman and want to get on\r\none of these cars, it is possible you will fail to consider these\r\nthings. Only a day or two ago a fatal accident occurred in the rush for\r\nthe trams. Such a serious case is, no doubt, rare, but small injuries\r\nmust be of frequent occurrence, torn clothes and bruises part of the\r\ndaily round, the common talk of those who struggle for the trams. It is\r\nunpleasantly common to see women knocked off their feet and dragged in\r\nthe road. Nor is the Blackfriars terminus the only battlefield. The\r\nWestminster Bridge Road is no whit better, and there, with a roadway\r\nsomewhat narrower and a somewhat larger quantity of quick traffic, the\r\ndanger is even greater.”\r\n\r\nThe remedy for this state of affairs was thus significantly pointed\r\nout:--\r\n\r\n“When electricity is fully adopted the service will be able to deal with\r\na larger traffic, for, although the same number of cars will be\r\nrunning, they will run faster, and each will carry 50 per cent. more\r\npassengers, so that the carrying capacity of the line will be much\r\nincreased. Till then there is no hope of improvement. It is impossible\r\nwith horse traction to run more cars, or run them faster.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_LONDON’S TRAMWAYS_\r\n\r\n“When all is done, the help of good counsel is that which setteth\r\nbusiness straight.”--BACON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE L.C.C. AND LONDON’S TRAFFIC\r\n\r\nAll tramways within the boundaries of the County of London--an area of\r\nsome 16½ by 12 miles--will eventually be controlled and worked by the\r\nLondon County Council, who, under the Tramways Act of 1870, have the\r\npower of purchasing, either compulsorily at the expiration of twenty-one\r\nyears from the passing of the Act, or by agreement, any tramway\r\nundertaking within their official territory. A heavy responsibility\r\ntruly; but whether for good or for evil, municipal trading has come to\r\nstay, and the principle as applied to tramways seems to be particularly\r\nappropriate in this, our great metropolis, with whose locomotive system\r\nnone but a very powerful and experienced governing body can ever hope to\r\nsuccessfully cope.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Allen-Baker, the vice-chairman of the L.C.C.’s Highways\r\nCommittee, reporting on the subject of our congested highways, said:\r\n“Even though there should be no future increase in street traffic, I\r\nbelieve it to be the imperative duty of the Council to seek a remedy,\r\nand how much more when we feel assured that London will keep growing,\r\nand that within the next thirty years both a water and locomotive\r\nservice will have to be provided for an estimated population (in Greater\r\nLondon) of probably not less than ten or twelve million people; and\r\nwhatever the growth _outwards_ may be, the best system of rapid transit\r\nfor the central districts will always become more and more essential.\r\nIf, therefore, we are to cope with either our present or our future\r\nrequirements, and prevent our streets from becoming really impassable,\r\nit is, in my judgment, our duty to take up the subject at once, and seek\r\nfrom His Majesty’s Government those additional powers and amendments to\r\nexisting Acts of Parliament that will enable the Council, as the central\r\nauthority, to carry out these improvements in the interests of the whole\r\nmetropolis.”\r\n\r\nI doubt if anybody realises the gigantic scale of Greater London’s\r\nstreet traffic, so much of it being hidden away. It is estimated that in\r\none year travellers by cabs and omnibuses number 580,000,000, and by\r\ntramways 400,000,000. By Underground, Tube, and suburban railways\r\n890,000,000 travel; and should the metropolis increase at the rate\r\nexpected by Mr. J. Allen-Baker, in thirty years’ time there will be\r\nsomething like 4,000,000,000, or 11,000,000 human beings per diem,\r\nmoving about on wheels or on foot.\r\n\r\nAll these facts will doubtless be carefully considered, and, if\r\npossible, the problem of London’s traffic solved, by the Royal\r\nCommission--Sir David Miller Barbour, K.C.S.I., K.C.M.G., in the\r\nchair--appointed in February last to deal with the subject. (_vide_\r\nChapter IX.). It is authorised to report:--\r\n\r\n(1) As to the measures which they deem most effectual for the\r\nimprovement of the same (the street traffic) by the development and\r\ninterconnection of railways and tramways on or below the surface, by\r\nincreasing the facilities for other forms of mechanical locomotion, by\r\nbetter provision for the organisation and regulation of vehicular and\r\npedestrian traffic or otherwise; and\r\n\r\n(2) As to the desirability of establishing some authority or tribunal to\r\nwhich all schemes of railway or tramway construction of a local\r\ncharacter should be referred, and the powers which it would be advisable\r\nto confer upon such a body.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE L.C.C. AND REHOUSING\r\n\r\nThe tramway policy of the L.C.C. is so connected with the housing, or,\r\nrather, with the rehousing question, that although this book is purely\r\non the subject of electrical traction, I cannot avoid making some\r\nreference to it.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years, since, under the Local Government Act of 1888, the\r\nCouncil was constituted, it has slowly been winning the confidence of\r\nLondoners. Aggressive at first, it has relinquished the altruistic\r\ntheories of youth, and it now realises the fact that it is a body of\r\ntrustees acting not for one class only, but that it must administer its\r\nheritage in the interests of the community at large. Jealousy of its\r\npowers is dying out, and by comprehensive and energetic action it\r\njustifies itself as the one central privileged body able to deal with\r\nthe highway, and with the housing problem of Modern Babylon.\r\n\r\nOne of its provinces, in fact its statutory obligation, is to provide\r\nnew accommodation--not necessarily in the same locality--in place of all\r\nhouses destroyed as unfit for human habitation. It also takes upon\r\nitself voluntarily (where no such legal obligation exists) in certain\r\ninstances to provide for rehousing, and, wherever possible, this is\r\neffected in the same districts. But this cannot as a rule be done when\r\nrehousing is compulsory, and to meet the difficulty, estates have been\r\nacquired, and blocks of houses and cottages erected at Croydon, Wood\r\nGreen, Brixton Hill, Holloway, Hammersmith, and other more or less\r\nsuburban spots. The Model Dwellings built on the site of Millbank\r\nPrison, and inspected by the King and Queen on February 18th last,\r\naccommodate 4,500 men, women, and children. At Tooting, the L.C.C.\r\nscheme provides for 8,600 people; at Norbury, for 5,800; while at\r\nTottenham there will be quite a new town of 40,000 artisan inhabitants.\r\n\r\nEncouragement is given by the Council to the idea that working-men and\r\nwomen--since they cannot, in so many cases, live chock-a-block with\r\ntheir employment--should be provided with homes upon, or a little\r\nbeyond, the Council’s boundaries, and be brought backwards and forwards\r\nby train, for the popular 1_d._ Being practical men, the Councillors\r\nknow that any transference on a large scale of London factories to the\r\ncountry, however desirable, cannot be effected yet awhile. And even if\r\nthey could acquire sites in the centres of industry, and erect gigantic\r\nlodging-houses, the cost would be prohibitive. They have to deal with\r\nthe present necessity. Their ideal is probably the workshop as it exists\r\nin London, with the heads of firms at Belsize Park, Bayswater, and\r\nDulwich, the clerks at Wandsworth, Chelsea, and Fulham, and the workmen\r\nat Tottenham, Wood Green, and Hammersmith.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, figures quoted by Mr. Troupe, of the Home Office,[5]\r\nshow to what a large extent it might be possible to relieve congestion\r\nby the removal of factories to the country. He said that there were 748\r\nfactories in London classified, in the following proportions, viz. 50\r\nfor machine-making, 30 for bread and biscuit-baking, 14 for\r\ncabinet-making, 11 for turning out fruit preserves, 16 breweries, 47\r\nbook-binding establishments, 72 printing houses (not including\r\nnewspapers), and 19 saw-mills. In these 748 factories close upon 200,000\r\npeople were employed, representing with their families some 600,000\r\nhuman beings, and if, following the recent example of the largest\r\ncabinet-makers in London, the bulk of these removed into the country,\r\nwhich they might do if suitable railway arrangements could be made, a\r\nconsiderable number of the 600,000 men, women, and children would be\r\nrehoused amidst “fresh woods and pastures new,” greatly to their\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThis is a dream at present, as factories cannot without great loss be\r\nsummarily transferred from suitable urban quarters where water-frontages\r\nand locomotive facilities exist. They have grown up with, and in many\r\ncases created the district in which they are situated. Bermondsey has\r\nfor years been the home of the leather trade, Lambeth of the pottery\r\nindustry, and although Mr. Justice Grantham instances Doulton’s as an\r\nawful example of an uneconomical delinquent London manufactory--their\r\nclay in Dorsetshire, their coal in the Midlands, their salt in Cheshire,\r\nand their works on the banks of the Thames--it is no light matter to\r\nbreak with long business ties and take up with fresh ones, not so easy\r\nto leave the old love and take up with the new.\r\n\r\nIt will be granted, however, that Mr. William L. Magden was right when\r\nhe maintained that “no manufacturer about to commence business at the\r\npresent day would fix upon London as a suitable position. He would\r\nchoose rather a district in which land was cheap, and in which he could\r\nobtain cheap power for his machinery and transport for his goods. He\r\nshould not in future be limited to the colliery districts or to the main\r\nlines of railway. Light railways serving as feeders to the main lines,\r\nand the supply of electrical energy over large areas from main power\r\nstations, could provide for both these requirements, giving the\r\nmanufacturer ample assurance that his works could be run cheaply, and\r\nthat the raw material and manufactured products could be efficiently\r\nhandled. By such means electrical science is capable of opening up\r\nthousands of square miles in England for manufacturing purposes, the\r\nnative population of which has been languishing under the chronic\r\ncomplaint of agricultural depression.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE L.C.C.’S TRAMWAY SYSTEM\r\n\r\nWhether, as regards tramways, the L.C.C. will be the central authority\r\nrecommended by the Royal Commissioners, time will show; but meanwhile it\r\nhas already established its tramway system, which can be seen at work in\r\nour midst. In order to understand it the more easily, it should be\r\nassumed that all the lines, including those of the London United\r\nTramways Company, are in the hands of the Council, that they are more or\r\nless linked together, that powers for new lines have been granted, and\r\nthat electrical traction in some form has been adopted throughout.\r\n\r\nOn studying a tramway map, one is struck by the fact that, starting from\r\nthe central area of London, all the tram-lines meander towards the\r\nCouncil’s boundaries, where they will eventually no doubt join and\r\ninterchange through traffic with the vast light railway or rural tramway\r\nsystems of various companies in the direction of north and south,\r\nnorth-east, south-east, north-west, and south-west; but that “through”\r\n(or cross-country) communication from west to east, practically does\r\nnot exist.\r\n\r\nIn the north-west there are huge areas of brick and mortar as destitute\r\nof tram-lines as Central Australia, so that anyone living in the\r\nRegent’s Park districts has to “train” it eastward, or, if he be bent on\r\n“tramming” it, has to go by an inconvenient and awkward route to Hackney\r\nor Bow.\r\n\r\nAnother notable feature of the map is that, although there are almost as\r\nmany tramways on the south as on the north side of the river, there is\r\nno access from one to the other, the bridges being looked upon as sacred\r\nthoroughfares, along which tramcars--certainly not as unæsthetic as\r\nomnibuses, or waggons laden with vegetables--may not pass, although\r\nWestminster is the widest bridge in the world, 85 feet; Blackfriars, 80\r\nfeet; and Vauxhall and Lambeth will be equally wide, and broad enough to\r\naccommodate the trams without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAt present the lines are painfully disunited, without starting-point or\r\nterminus. The gaps in the lines require to be filled up, and where this\r\nis impracticable, shallow underground tracks should be made use of. The\r\ngreat defect, however, would at once disappear if the lines could cross\r\nthe Thames at Westminster and Blackfriars; but if this be persistently\r\nrefused, light bridges or tubes ought to be specially provided at\r\nconvenient points with four tracks for the use of tramways only.\r\n\r\nThe history of the London County Council’s work towards the improvement\r\nof metropolitan highways dates back to the early nineties, when the\r\nCouncil began to acquire tramway companies. A most important step was\r\ntaken in 1897, when the whole of the lines and depôts belonging to the\r\nNorth Metropolitan and London Street Tramways Companies in the County of\r\nLondon were purchased, the purchase-money being £800,000. In 1899 the\r\nCouncil acquired the South London Tramways at a cost of £882,043, and\r\nstill more recently the control of the South Eastern Metropolitan\r\nTramways Company and the South London Company has been effected.\r\nNegotiations for other acquisitions are pending, and, as a matter of\r\nfact, there are now not a dozen miles of tramway lines within the county\r\nwhich the Council has not already purchased.\r\n\r\nThe North Metropolitan lines have been leased by the Council to the\r\nCompany for fourteen years from 1896. The South London lines are worked\r\ndirectly by the Council, and in the year 1901-2 no fewer than\r\n119,880,559 passengers were carried over the system, 53,639,489 being at\r\nhalfpenny fares and 50,913,036 at penny ones. The traffic receipts for\r\nthe year amounted to over £439,000, and the mileage run was over\r\n10,000,000. About 4,500,000 workmen’s tickets were issued during the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThus our metropolitan Councillors have, after due deliberation and much\r\nsearching of hearts, launched a prodigious undertaking. Whether it will\r\nor will not prove too costly is another matter. Dr. Alexander B. W.\r\nKennedy, their consulting engineer, in his report, said: “I hope,\r\ntherefore, that the Committee will find themselves able to believe that\r\nthe enterprise in which they are about to embark is one which will not\r\nonly be for the benefit of Londoners generally, but one also which will\r\npay its way, and on which, therefore, there would seem to be no reason\r\nfor grudging such expenditure as to make the whole scheme one of a kind\r\nsuitable for and worthy of the greatest city in the world.”\r\n\r\nNot long ago the Council decided to adopt electrical traction on all\r\ntheir lines, involving an ultimate cost of £9,000,000 which will\r\ninclude the necessary generating stations, rolling-stock, purchase of\r\nsmaller undertakings, and extensions. The result attained will be a\r\nsplendid system, equivalent in length to two hundred miles of single\r\ntrack, though not larger than that of some big provincial cities.\r\nWherever possible the system will be that of the conduit underground;\r\nmore expensive than the trolley method, but in the crowded streets of\r\nLondon--where every inch of space is valuable--advantageous, and from a\r\nseverely æsthetic point of view, preferable, because it dispenses with\r\npoles and wires. But on lines acquired by the Council where already\r\nexists the overhead principle, there will be no difficulty in arranging\r\nthe cars so that they can be run from one system to the other, either\r\nwith no stopping at all at the point of change, or with a delay of but a\r\nsecond or two. The cars, except the trucks, will be made in England by\r\nBritish firms, and are to be double-decked, double-bogied, and\r\nthirty-two feet long; they are to hold twenty-eight passengers inside,\r\nand forty-two on the roof, and will be in two compartments. They will\r\nresemble the Liverpool cars, described in Chapter XIII, and will be\r\npainted a chocolate colour. The speed will be a maximum of twelve miles\r\nan hour, with an average of about seven.\r\n\r\nSupposing, therefore, that all the L.C.C. parliamentary Bills are\r\ncarried through, and that all the disunited lines are properly and\r\nharmoniously linked together, and through communication established in\r\nevery direction, it will be feasible to take some such day’s business\r\njourney within the Council’s boundaries as that of Benjamin Short which\r\nI am about to relate. But before doing so I think the very important\r\ndecision of the Lord Chancellor in an appeal case, November 27th, 1902,\r\non the subject of the maintenance of tramway tracks should be\r\nrecorded:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAINTENANCE OF TRAMWAY TRACKS\r\n\r\nOn March 4th, 1900, Mr. Fitzgerald was driving a horse and Ralli car in\r\nGrafton Street, Dublin, when the horse stumbled and fell, and the\r\nrespondent was flung out of the cart and sustained serious injuries. On\r\nthe ground that the surface of the paving at the place where he was\r\ndriving was unsafe for horses and in a condition which was a danger and\r\nannoyance to the ordinary traffic, he brought an action against the\r\ntramway company, and was awarded £1,000 damages, the jury holding that\r\nthe part of the roadway for which the company was responsible was at the\r\ntime slippery and unsafe, and that this was the cause of the horse\r\nfalling. They, at the same time, found that the misfortune was not\r\ncaused by the fabric of the pavement being improperly constructed or\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor, at the conclusion of the arguments, moved that the\r\nappeal should be dismissed. The tramway company had been permitted the\r\nuse of the public highway subject to certain obligations, which\r\npractically meant that while they were to use it they must take care\r\nthat the safety and convenience of the public were consulted. They were\r\nnot to have a monopoly of the highway, and it was their duty to take\r\ncare of the public convenience in respect to that part of the roadway\r\nover which they were permitted to exercise a kind of subordinate\r\ndominion. It was not denied that the surface of the roadway became, in\r\ncertain states of the weather, a danger and a nuisance to the public,\r\nand it was a strong contention to say that, having received\r\ninstructions from the road authority to do that which would have\r\nprevented the accident, there should be no liability upon them. The\r\nobligation, as he read the statute, was to keep the pavement in a fit\r\nand proper condition for public traffic. How that was to be done was a\r\nquestion of mechanical engineering, and neither the Legislature nor the\r\nCourt was called upon to enter into the question as to how it could best\r\nbe done. All the judges without exception seemed to agree that the best\r\nand most proper mode of doing it was to do what the road authority\r\ndirected them to do, and that they had deliberately disobeyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BUSINESS JOURNEY BY L.C.C. TRAMS\r\n\r\nBenjamin Short was born and brought up in London, and if any man living\r\nknew its ins and outs he did. He was a jovial-looking little man, always\r\ncalled Ben, for, said his father, “We christened him Benjamin for long,\r\nbut as he grew so slowly, we called him Ben for short; for _short_ he\r\nis, and short he always will be--except of cash!”\r\n\r\nShort the elder was a small tobacconist in the days when the fragrant\r\nweed was first put up and sold in packets--a paying idea, as he soon\r\ndiscovered--and to effectually put it into practice, he used a\r\nfast-trotting mare and a roomy, comfortable trap.\r\n\r\nBen, as he grew up, was allowed to accompany his father on these\r\njourneys, and having abundant powers of observation and natural\r\nquickness, he came to know more about Greater London than most men of\r\ndouble his age. He was cut out for a commercial traveller’s career, and\r\na traveller, in due course, he became, inheriting from his father a snug\r\nbit of capital.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I am writing, Ben lived at Stamford Hill, close to\r\nthe London County Council boundary, in a well-built house with a bit of\r\nland at the back, in which he had invested his inheritance. He called it\r\n“The Watchmaker’s Rest,” and it faced the tramway line. Its front garden\r\nwas the envy and admiration of the neighbours. There appeared in their\r\nseason the choicest bulbous flowers, lovely annuals, herbaceous plants,\r\nchrysanthemums, and asters, all of irreproachable quality, for Short,\r\nbeing a sober and steady man, devoted his spare time to horticulture, at\r\nwhich he was an adept.\r\n\r\nBen Short travelled for a large wholesale firm of watchmakers and\r\njewellers in Clerkenwell, whose ware-house was not far from the\r\njunction of Goswell Road and Old Street. Thither Short went to business\r\nevery day at eight o’clock from Stamford Hill, not by a Tube (“Toob” he\r\ncalled it), but by the tram which passed his door. He was a first-rate\r\nsalesman, working on salary and commission, as active and enduring as a\r\nbee, but as no travelling expenses within the London district were\r\nallowed him, he had to get about as cheaply as possible.\r\n\r\nHitherto he had been in the habit of working a single section of town\r\nuntil it was exhausted, and then taking up another. But one July morning\r\nthe head of the firm asked him if he could vary the plan and take the\r\npick of several districts in one day as an experiment. This was done to\r\ntest Short’s capacity as against that of an English-speaking German\r\ntraveller, a protégé of his partner, who had already tried his best by\r\ntrain and ’bus to cover a large area in one day, but had blundered over\r\nthe job. Ben Short, who had noticed a “foreigner” hanging about the\r\nplace a good deal, drew his own conclusions therefrom, and promptly\r\nacquiesced in the proposition, and replied that he was quite willing to\r\nshow how much could be done in twelve hours by one who knew his London\r\nwell and how best to make use of its locomotive facilities. Ben intended\r\nto make a record!\r\n\r\nTo save time he took home with him from the sample-room his bag, an\r\ninconspicuous, well-worn old companion. It was easily carried, as the\r\ncontents, though valuable, were light. Next morning at 7.30 to the\r\nminute he was at breakfast, clean as a new pin, thoroughly well groomed,\r\na man of peace, but if you had put your hand into the side pocket of his\r\ncoat you would have found a smooth ivory handle, suspiciously like that\r\nof a neat six-shooter--in case of accidents! At eight o’clock he was in\r\na comfortable electric tram bound on his first stage to far-off\r\nHammersmith.\r\n\r\nThe route was _viâ_ Stamford Hill, High Street, Stoke Newington Road,\r\nand Kingsland Road, and, branching off at Hackney Road, by way of Old\r\nStreet and Clerkenwell Road, to the western end of Theobald’s Road.\r\nThence, a long stretch by way of Hart Street, Bloomsbury, along part of\r\nNew Oxford Street, into Oxford Street, past the Marble Arch, along the\r\nUxbridge Road, past Notting Hill Gate, and down the beautifully paved,\r\nbroad incline towards Shepherd’s Bush, then to the left through Brook\r\nGreen, and so to the Broadway, Hammersmith--one of the most interesting\r\nrides in London, and but recently added to the London County Council\r\nsystem, after tremendous agitation and opposition on the part of the\r\n“Tube” and others, but absolutely necessary to complete the linking of\r\nother and disjointed sections.\r\n\r\nHere, at Hammersmith, Ben Short transacted some very satisfactory\r\nbusiness in King Street. It was early; his “clients” had just finished\r\ntheir breakfasts, their shops had been but a few minutes opened, and\r\nthey had leisure to attend to his persuasive arguments. He was a\r\nfavourite wherever he went, and as he carried exactly the kind of goods\r\nto attract, he quickly booked orders and was free to proceed.\r\n\r\nOn board once more, at good speed Ben was rolled along Fulham Road,\r\nleaving on the right the big convent jealously guarded by high walls,\r\nwhich made Ben fall to wondering how any sane young woman could\r\nvoluntarily cut herself off from a world about which she probably knew\r\npractically nothing. On went the tram, past the big buildings of the\r\nFulham Workhouse, past the entrance to Fulham Palace and the Bishop’s\r\nPark, along the widened High Street of Fulham, over Putney Bridge, and\r\nby way of Putney Bridge Road and West Hill, Wandsworth (a new route), to\r\nLower Tooting--altogether a pleasant trip at that time of the year, for\r\ngardens, at which he critically and eagerly gazed, greeted Ben in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWasting no time, Short called upon all the most likely customers, and\r\nagain he was in luck, for whether they wanted watches and jewellery or\r\nnot, orders were booked.\r\n\r\nNow the energetic little man had to get to the “Elephant and Castle.”\r\nAlong the Balham Hill Road, with its pleasant shops and lively\r\npedestrians, was plain sailing enough, past umbrageous Clapham Common on\r\nthe left, edged with sedate and comfortable mansions recalling the old\r\ndays when prosperous Evangelicism dwelt exclusively in Clapham; then by\r\nway of Clapham Road and Kennington Park Road to the far-famed “Elephant\r\nand Castle.” Here a less sharp-witted man than Short might well be\r\nbewildered by the wonderful concentration of tram lines converging from\r\nWalworth Road, New Kent Road, Newington Causeway, London Road, St.\r\nGeorge’s Road, and the road he had come by. Here, if anywhere, as at the\r\nMansion House, well-arranged passenger subways are needed.\r\n\r\nOur “commercial” did much business round about, for it was one of his\r\nbest districts for cheap goods, and then he thought it was time to\r\nrefresh the inner man. In a neighbouring cool, clean little crib--“a\r\nclose borough of his own,” he called it--he rested, and made intimate\r\nacquaintance with a noble piece of silver-side, some crisp lettuces, and\r\nany amount of piccalilli--he was a lover of cold meat and pickles--but,\r\nin accordance with a rule he never broke in business hours, he\r\nrestricted himself to coffee as a beverage.\r\n\r\nShort, braced up by his luncheon, was now ready to set out for the wilds\r\nof Plumstead--a somewhat long journey. He started by train from the\r\n“Elephant and Castle” _viâ_ the New and the Old Kent Roads, New Cross\r\nRoad, Greenwich Road, Trafalgar Road, Greenwich and Woolwich Lower Roads\r\nto Woolwich, and by the Plumstead Road to Plumstead itself. He worked\r\nthe two districts together, but his luck had deserted him, and orders\r\nwere fewer and farther between than he altogether liked; but he was not\r\ngoing to “chuck the thing up” yet. He would do a bit of the East End,\r\nand thus complete the circuit of London.\r\n\r\nHe took the same route back from Plumstead as far as Blackwall Lane,\r\nthen _viâ_ the Blackwall Tunnel to East India Dock Road, Burdett Road,\r\nand Mile End Road to its junction with Cambridge Road. In this\r\nneighbourhood he did his only extensive bit of walking. The district,\r\nthough poor, was large, and he did a fair amount of business, but as\r\ntime was getting on he decided to return home; so by Cambridge Road,\r\nalong Cambridge Heath, Mare Street, Lower and Upper Clapton Roads, he\r\ngot back to Stamford Hill, and was put down almost at his own house.\r\n\r\nHe had travelled by electric tramway some fifty miles at a cost of about\r\n2_s._ 1_d._ (or a halfpenny a mile). He had done a lot of business, and\r\nhad been absent just twelve hours!\r\n\r\nIn the bosom of his family he found ample compensation for his\r\nexertions. A hearty welcome and a savoury supper, accompanied by\r\nsomething that was _not_ coffee, awaited him, and the following day the\r\nfirm received him with acclamation. The Teuton was not “in it,” and Ben\r\nShort reigned supreme as its chief and highly appreciated traveller.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON UNITED TRAMWAYS COMPANY\r\n\r\nWant of space forbids more than the mere mention of the South\r\nMetropolitan and the London Southern, the Woolwich and South Eastern,\r\nthe West Ham, and the Northern Middlesex Tramways. But this chapter\r\nwould be incomplete without some reference to the useful and popular\r\norganisation, the London United Tramways Company, that takes up the\r\nrunning at the London County Council’s boundary.\r\n\r\nForty million passengers were conveyed last year over its original route\r\nof twenty-two miles, extending from Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith to\r\nSouthall, Hounslow, and Twickenham. In one week alone over a million\r\nwere carried.\r\n\r\nLast April an important extension was inaugurated from Twickenham, which\r\nbrought the trams through Teddington and Hampton Wick right to the gates\r\nof\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. BOILER-ROOM, LONDON UNITED TRAMWAYS CO.’S POWER\r\nHOUSE AT CHISWICK, FITTED WITH VICARS’ AUTOMATIC STOKERS\r\n\r\n_By permission of T. and T. Vicars_, _Earlstown, Lancashire_]\r\n\r\nHampton Court Palace, and from Richmond Bridge to Hampton Court. In the\r\nnear future these extensions will be connected with new lines running to\r\nUxbridge, Thames Ditton, Surbiton, Hook, Kingston, New Malden,\r\nWimbledon, and Tooting; while eventually these western and southern\r\ntracks will, by the system of tubes, rejuvenated underground railways,\r\nand the L.C.C.’s electric tramways, be joined to those of northern and\r\neastern London. In three years’ time, when its extensions are completed,\r\nthe London United will have 100 miles of tram lines in operation.\r\n\r\nThe gauge is the standard 4 feet 8½ inches. Throughout the route the\r\noverhead trolley system has been adopted. At Chiswick is the power\r\nhouse, and the mains convey the electricity to sub-stations, six miles\r\napart, where rotary converters change the alternating into direct\r\ncurrent, and transform down the high voltage of 5,000 into the Board of\r\nTrade limit of 500. In the fine boiler-room T. and T. Vicars’ automatic\r\nstokers are used, and very interesting it is to watch the machines\r\ncontinually pushing small charges of coal into the furnaces without any\r\ndirect human agency.\r\n\r\nMounted on two four-wheeled bogie trucks, with two 25 horse-power\r\nmotors, the handsome cars seat thirty-nine passengers outside and thirty\r\ninside. On the Sunday after the opening of the extension no fewer than\r\n200,000 people journeyed from Hammersmith, Shepherd’s Bush, and\r\nRichmond, to Kew, Twickenham, Teddington, and Hampton Court; and on Whit\r\nMonday, 1903, the number reached 400,000, thus establishing a record. So\r\ngreat was the rush during some part of those days that a two minutes’\r\nservice of cars had to be provided.\r\n\r\nThe extension from Twickenham to Hampton Court was opened by Mr. C. T.\r\nYerkes, the Chairman, and author of the happy alliance of train, tube,\r\nand tram, which may possibly enable many toilers in the East End to live\r\nin the country. At the least, it will give them the chance, when\r\npossessed of a little leisure and a few pence, to quickly exchange their\r\nsordid environment for one of the numerous sylvan spots which surround\r\nLondon, especially in the west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. A LONDON UNITED TRAMWAYS COMPANY TRAM-CAR\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _London United Tramways Co., Ltd._]\r\n\r\nAlluding to this, Mr. C. T. Yerkes, at the inauguration, significantly\r\nremarked that it was a strange fact that London was particularly behind\r\nin transportation, being the most backward of all cities. Though during\r\nthe last twenty years in London, 900 miles of streets had been made, and\r\n340,000 houses had been built, it was only within the past few years\r\nthat intramural transportation had been even spoken of. The London\r\nUnited Tramway Company, he said, expected to join very intimately with\r\nthe Metropolitan District, forming a continuous line to Hampton Court\r\nfrom the City; and they anticipated connecting with the Great Northern,\r\nBrompton, and Piccadilly Circus Railway. People would be carried very\r\ncheaply, and when the District was electrified the mileage rates would\r\nbe abolished in favour of uniform fares, which were far the best. Poor\r\npeople who were living in an unenviable condition should have the chance\r\nof getting into the country.\r\n\r\nOn the much-debated question of American capital and American enterprise\r\nin Great Britain,[6] Mr. Speyer spoke no less to the point. He said that\r\nthose who undertook to provide the metropolis with an up-to-date system\r\nof locomotion should be encouraged, for they performed a task that\r\nshould have been done twenty years ago. English capital had had every\r\nopportunity of investment in underground lines, and if only half of the\r\nfive millions had been subscribed in this country it was not the fault\r\nof the promoters. They would have preferred that the Underground Company\r\nshould have English shareholders only, but unfortunately they had had to\r\nallot half of the shares of the Company to Americans and foreigners. One\r\nwould have thought, he said, that there would have been more keenness in\r\nLondon to build its own underground railways, which would so materially\r\nadd to the well-being of the masses. If either of the proposed lines\r\nwere situated in South Africa, Australia, or Klondyke, London investors\r\nwould have been tumbling over each other to subscribe. But the fault of\r\nthese lines was that they were at our own doors. It was a fact,\r\nincredible though it might seem, that the richest city in the world did\r\nnot appear able or willing to provide the funds for what was really a\r\npublic necessity--_quicker transit_. So let them hear nothing more of\r\nAmerican invasion, if people here stood with folded arms and allowed\r\nothers to do the work which they ought to have done themselves; for\r\nwhile they persisted in this _non possumus_ attitude, no one could blame\r\nthe Company if they went elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_PROVINCIAL TRAMWAYS_\r\n\r\n“They shall measure to their cities round about.”--DEUTERONOMY xxi. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHT RAILWAYS ACT OF 1896\r\n\r\nIn the year 1896 an Act of Parliament was passed which, it is no\r\nexaggeration to say, revolutionised tramway locomotion, and was destined\r\nto produce consequences undreamt of by the promoters of the measure.\r\n\r\nUnder the Tramways Act of 1870, Municipal Corporations had been\r\nexercising their powers of buying up existing tramways, working them in\r\nthe interests of the ratepayers, and of generally entering into the\r\nbusiness of providing a cheap and efficient means of traversing the area\r\nwithin their boundaries. They used the new Light Railways Act of 1896\r\noccasionally, but only for the promotion (by two or more combined local\r\nauthorities) of certain lines running through several districts.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1870, tramways, like railways and canals, had to be promoted by\r\nspecial Bills, and the Tramways Act of that year was intended to\r\nfacilitate their construction, and to cheapen and simplify the method of\r\nobtaining parliamentary powers, either by Bill or by the alternative of\r\nan application to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order authorising\r\nthe construction of the tramway, the said Order being subsequently\r\nconfirmed by an Act of Parliament introduced by the Board.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1870 provided that no tram line should be sanctioned without\r\nthe consent of the district local authority, and that the local\r\nauthority might buy up the undertaking at the end of twenty-one years at\r\nits then value--practically only the worth of the rolling-stock and\r\nplant, without any allowance for the goodwill of a going concern.\r\n\r\nIn either case (that of a private Bill in Parliament or a Board of Trade\r\nProvisional Order), if a tramway was planned to run through two or more\r\ndistricts, the consent of the local authorities having jurisdiction over\r\ntwo-thirds of the length of the line was sufficient. But this condition\r\ngave the local authorities owning just over a third of the route, power\r\nto veto the whole scheme.\r\n\r\nUnder the same Act, land, otherwise than by mutual agreement, could not\r\nbe acquired by tramway promoters.\r\n\r\nUp to 1896, electric tramway schemes had remained in abeyance, but\r\nthough the Light Railways Act removed many obstacles to their increase,\r\nand made electric traction commercially possible, it did not bestow\r\nperfect liberty of action. But the fresh legislation on the subject,\r\nanticipated during this year’s session of Parliament, will doubtless\r\nresult in such amendment of the Act as will abolish all ground of\r\ncomplaint on the part of the advocates of the industry.\r\n\r\nAt the time the 1896 measure became law, hardly any Tramway Company in\r\nGreat Britain, whether horse-drawn or steam-propelled, paid its way,\r\nexcept in a few large centres. The companies knew that the time was\r\ndrawing near when they could be bought out by corporations; so they had\r\nno inducement to make expensive reforms; and only by charging high\r\nfares, and by avoiding every possible form of capital-expenditure,\r\ncould they keep their heads above water. Their undertakings, one and\r\nall, sank into a state of inefficiency, and a strong public feeling\r\narose in favour of their being reformed, and worked with improved cars\r\nand at popular tariffs by local authorities. So, one by one, these\r\nbodies absorbed the private companies, placed new rolling-stock on the\r\nlines, and adopted electrical traction, to the advantage of the public,\r\nand in one notable instance--that of Glasgow--it is claimed, at great\r\npecuniary benefit to the ratepayers also.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL TRAMWAY UNDERTAKINGS\r\n\r\nThroughout the British Isles these municipal tramway undertakings now\r\nflourish and increase in number. Take a map, and we shall see that the\r\ncoast line from the North Foreland to Plymouth is dotted with towns\r\nprovided with electric trams, while inland, Camborne, a Cornish\r\ntin-mining centre, marks their western English limit. Then round Land’s\r\nEnd along the Bristol Channel it is the same. South and North Wales show\r\na blank until Llandudno is reached. Then up-to-date towns provided with\r\nelectric traction thicken on the Lancashire coast as far as Fleetwood.\r\nIn the Isle of Man there are no fewer than four electric tramways.\r\nExcept at Glasgow and district, the west of Scotland is bare of any kind\r\nof tram, and continues so round the North Cape and the East Coast until\r\nwe come to Aberdeen, Dundee, and Kirkcaldy. Next are clusters reaching\r\nfrom North Shields to Middlesbrough. After this, electric trams are to\r\nbe found at Hull, Great Grimsby, and Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nInland are three great centres--Liverpool, Manchester, and\r\nBirmingham--around which “electrified” towns gather thickly. Isolated\r\nGuernsey and the Isle of Wight each possess an electric tram, the\r\nlatter being on Ryde pier.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland there is a wide stretch of country, empty and desolate from\r\nan electric tramway point of view, _i.e._ from the Giant’s Causeway to\r\nCork, except at Newry, Dundalk, Lurgan, and Dublin. By far the greater\r\nnumber of these British and Irish tramways are on the overhead trolley\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe 1896 Act provided for the establishment of a Light Railways\r\nCommission of three members, whose special work was to facilitate the\r\nconstruction and working of tramways or light railways in Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, the Commissioners being appointed by the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nApplication for a Light Railway Order may be made for a county, borough,\r\nor district council by any individual, corporation, or company, or\r\njointly by councils, individuals, corporations, or companies.\r\nApplications have to be referred to the Commissioners in the first\r\ninstance, and, if approved of, are placed before the Board of Trade for\r\nconfirmation. Provision is made by the Act for the purchase of land\r\nunder certain conditions specified in the Lands Clauses Act. Provision\r\nis also made for enabling local authorities to acquire any undertaking\r\nwhose route passes through their district, the time and terms of\r\npurchase being arranged by agreement between the promoters and the\r\nmunicipalities, the terms of sale, usually thirty-five years’ purchase,\r\nbeing settled on the basis of a fair market value of the line in full\r\nwork, but with no allowance for compulsory acquisition.\r\n\r\nLocal authorities, landowners, and adjacent railway companies have the\r\nright to object to proposed lines. The local authorities, however,\r\npossess no power of veto, but generally the Commissioners refuse\r\napplications from promoters if their schemes are strongly protested\r\nagainst by the municipalities concerned.\r\n\r\nTo what extent this Act has been taken advantage of may be judged by the\r\nfact that last year no fewer than forty-seven municipalities were stated\r\nto have disbursed, or to have decided to disburse, eleven millions\r\nsterling in their electric tramways. In several instances the\r\nmunicipality owns the tramways and leases them on certain conditions to\r\nlarge companies or syndicates, a kind of compromise between absolute\r\nurban control and unrestricted private enterprise.\r\n\r\nHow it works in the provinces can be understood by taking as examples\r\nfour of the largest cities in Great Britain, viz., Glasgow, Liverpool,\r\nManchester, and Birmingham.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLASGOW TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\nGlasgow, with a population of some seven hundred thousand, possesses the\r\nmost successful and lucrative system of municipal tramways in the world,\r\nthe working for the year ending May, 1902, on a capital expenditure of\r\nnearly two millions, showing a gross revenue of £614,413, with a gross\r\nbalance of £200,371; and so large was the reserve fund in consequence,\r\nthat it was applied to the writing off of all expenditure on the old\r\nhorse-traction plant and equipment, so that the capital account included\r\nonly the expenditure relating to the new (electrical) system of\r\nlocomotion. In the language of the bookmakers, the city of Glasgow’s\r\ntramways stood, financially, on velvet. In 1894 the Corporation began\r\nthe service of tramways (heretofore leased by it to a private company)\r\nwith everything new--buildings, horses, and cars--their policy being a\r\nvery frequent service at low fares. Not satisfied with horses, they\r\nsoon began to search about for some better method of traction, and in\r\n1899 resolved to substitute electricity on the overhead trolley system,\r\nand accordingly the change was effected; new lines were from time to\r\ntime constructed, until at the present moment Glasgow possesses,\r\nincluding leased lines, 140 miles of single track and nearly six hundred\r\ndouble and single-deck cars.\r\n\r\nUnlike the somewhat haphazard fashion of London, the Glasgow tramway\r\nlines have been planned in a skilful manner and on a definite system, to\r\ngive means of transit from the north and south and east and west of the\r\ncity. It is divided into five separate and independent areas, each\r\nsupplied with current from its own sub-station, but these areas can be\r\ninterconnected if necessary.\r\n\r\nOn a convenient side of the Clyde, with ample facilities for obtaining\r\ncoal and water, is the main generating station, built with a steel\r\nframing clothed with Glasgow plastic clay, two great chimney-shafts, 263\r\nfeet high, towering above it. In this fine building is contained a\r\nmighty specimen of what is called the three-phase distribution of\r\nelectrical energy, the system being to create the power at one centre\r\nand distribute it over a wide area; that is, electricity is produced in\r\nthe form of three-phase alternating current at a pressure of 6,500\r\nvolts, and sent on to five outlying sub-stations, where it is\r\ntransformed to a potential of 310 volts, and then converted from\r\nalternating into continuous current at 500 volts, for working the cars.\r\nThe total capacity of the main station is:--\r\n\r\n    Three-phase plant, 10,000 kilowatts.\r\n    Direct-current plant, 1,200 kilowatts.\r\n\r\nThe engines used to produce this are of 16,000 h.p. capacity, while each\r\nof the generators is of the great weight of ninety tons, almost the\r\nlargest in existence for traction work.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the tramway enterprise of Glasgow is in its magnitude and\r\nits good management almost unique. The size of its power-house will be\r\nsurpassed by that which supplies the Electrified Metropolitan District\r\nRailway; but the wise and economical arrangement of its traffic can\r\nhardly be beaten, and is a model to other large cities and towns\r\ncontemplating the adoption of electric tramway traction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIVERPOOL TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\nOn a large scale are the Liverpool Corporation Tramways, the total\r\nmileage being 127 of single track, the rolling-stock 451 cars, and the\r\ncapital a little over a million.\r\n\r\nWhen the Corporation acquired the Liverpool United Tramways and Omnibus\r\nCompany’s undertaking, in 1897, they at once decided to use electricity\r\non the overhead trolley system, instead of horses. Singularly graceful\r\ncentre and bracket poles with arched arms and scroll-work were adopted\r\nin the wide thoroughfares, and in the narrow streets the overhead\r\nconductor-wire was upheld by rosettes attached to buildings on each\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe new cars are remarkably fine and comfortable, and include the\r\nContinental single-deck, with a side entrance, and the double-deck,\r\nabout 27 feet long, with doors at the ends, and with three large,\r\nwell-curtained plate-glass windows on each side. A special kind of\r\nstaircase is fitted to these double-deckers to enable people, the aged\r\nand infirm in particular, to descend in safety even when the cars are in\r\nmotion. They are also fitted with useful revolving route-indicators,\r\nwhich, being illuminated, light up the upper deck as well. No one can\r\ngrumble at the fares charged, which are at the rate of one penny per\r\nstage of two miles. That these tramways are a great boon is shown by the\r\nenormous number of passengers--nearly 100,000,000--carried last year.\r\n\r\nAt Pumpfields, near the Exchange and Waterloo Goods Stations, and at\r\nLister, near Newsham Park, are the power stations, each housing plant of\r\n15,000 horse-power (up to 7,500 kilowatt capacity). The energy is\r\ndistributed to sub-stations, and thence to the cars at the safe orthodox\r\npressure of 500 volts.\r\n\r\nThe Liverpool tramway routes necessitate many twistings and turnings.\r\nThe junction of lines at the intersection of the London Road and Lime\r\nStreet is a sight worth seeing, there being at that place special\r\ntrackwork with sixteen points.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANCHESTER TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\nManchester--fifth largest city in the empire--has a wide district to\r\nserve, as the Corporation works certain tramways in such districts as\r\nStockport, Heaton-Norris, etc. Thus its track consists of 150 miles of\r\nsingle line, and its rolling-stock of 600 cars, worked on the overhead\r\ntrolley system.\r\n\r\nThese cars are of three sizes, and carry respectively 67, 43, and 20\r\npassengers, the smallest cars being single-deck. The larger ones have\r\nsix nicely-draped plate-glass windows on each side, and the upholstery,\r\nfittings, and lighting are excellent.\r\n\r\nThe estimated capital expenditure is the same as at Glasgow, two\r\nmillions sterling. A speciality of the Manchester Tramways undertaking\r\nis its splendid car depôt, the site covering three acres, two and a\r\nhalf of which is roofed over. The façade to Boyle Street is 700 feet\r\nlong, and reminds one of some large and picturesque public school, a\r\ntramway-car depôt being the last thing one would take it to be. It is\r\nclaimed to be the largest car-shed area in Europe, and the covered-in\r\nportion is the most extensive in the world. In this and three other\r\nsimilar sheds and a few smaller ones elsewhere all the cars are stabled.\r\nFormerly they were concentrated in one place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. FAÇADE OF QUEEN’S ROAD CAR-SHED, MANCHESTER\r\nCORPORATION TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Manchester Corporation Tramways._]\r\n\r\nThe cars are of the British Thomson-Houston Company type,\r\ndouble-motored, and are fine examples of elegance and solidity combined,\r\nand fitted with all the latest improvements for the comfort of\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRMINGHAM TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\nBirmingham, as regards tramways, stands in a peculiar position. Its city\r\narea is restricted; it has only short lengths of tram lines, and these\r\nrequire to be linked up with outlying districts. The lines were leased\r\nto the City of Birmingham Tramways Company, but whether the Corporation\r\nwill or will not take them over now, has not yet been decided. However,\r\nby a majority of fourteen votes it has sanctioned the substitution of\r\nelectricity on the overhead method, and this is being proceeded with;\r\nand when the transformation is complete Birmingham and district will\r\nhave an electric tramway system of nearly a hundred and ten miles. Its\r\ntramways have always been popular, and at a charge of a penny for a\r\nthree-mile ride--a record for cheapness--56,000 passengers made use of\r\nthem on Mafeking Day, no small proportion of a city of 522,182\r\ninhabitants!\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of tramways, it will be interesting to note\r\nthe fares charged in different parts of the world. In London they begin\r\nat a halfpenny. On the Continent they vary; for example, in Berlin the\r\nfare is 1¼_d._ for two miles, and a halfpenny for each additional mile;\r\nin Paris it is 3_d_. inside, with transfer ticket, and 1½_d._ on the\r\nplatforms, or outside the car; in St. Petersburg 1¼_d._ and 1½_d._ is\r\nthe fare; in Stockholm it is the curious sum of 1⅜_d._; in Florence it\r\nis 1_d._ from the suburbs to the city, and 1½_d._ across the city; in\r\nCape Town it is 3_d._ for three miles; and in Canada the fare averages\r\n2½_d._, and 5_d._ after midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL RURAL TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\nThe memorable question once put to the House of Commons, “What is a\r\npound?” to this day has not met with a strictly accurate reply. The same\r\nmay be said of the frequent inquiry, “What constitutes a Light Railway?”\r\n\r\nUnder the Act of 1896 a Tube should officially be described as a Light\r\nRailway. So should a Shallow Underground, an Urban Tramway, and a Rural\r\nTramway. So, too, should a Brighton Beach Line, or any short train\r\nrunning along a pier. So also should any railway line for the carrying\r\nof minerals, worked by heavy sixty-ton locomotives, and hauling five or\r\nsix hundred tons of ore at a time! _Reductio ad absurdum._\r\n\r\nThe originators of the Act did not define what a Light Railway really\r\nis, but they evidently had in their minds, _inter alia_, that railways,\r\nunrestricted by Board of Trade regulations as to fencing, sidings,\r\ngradients, and permanent stations, should be permitted to run along the\r\nhigh roads, acting as feeders to the existing lines, to the benefit of\r\nthe small towns, villages, and farms near which they passed. Thus a\r\npleasing vision unfolded itself of revived agricultural prosperity, of\r\nhandy little trams peacefully steaming along the highways, stopping,\r\nwhen hailed, at some convenient corner, where the farmers’ waggons would\r\nbe in waiting with produce to be taken away to market in exchange for\r\ngoods delivered to them.\r\n\r\nIt was a promising idea, for the cost of construction per mile would\r\nnecessarily bear no comparison with that of ordinary heavy railways. But\r\nin this form Light Railways were not developed. Agriculturists abandoned\r\nthe hope of any immediate relief, and it came to be recognised that the\r\nAct meant a development, not of goods, but of passenger traffic, and\r\nthat, so far as extra-urban districts were concerned, Light Railways\r\nmeant Tramways, just as they did in town or city.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, “Do not local railways answer all requirements of the\r\never-increasing population and already congested districts? Whereabouts\r\nare these country tramways that we hear so much about? and in what\r\nrespects are they so useful and necessary?”\r\n\r\nFor goods the network of local railways covering the country is no\r\ndoubt fairly sufficient, and eventually, when well-organised services of\r\nelectric-motor waggons aid in feeding them with merchandise collected\r\nand delivered at the very doors of consignor and consignee, they will\r\nfully answer their purpose; but for linking together city, town,\r\nvillage, and hamlet in the interests of working-men--in many districts\r\nthe chief customers--they are almost useless. For this class, wishing to\r\nget about quickly--going to and from their daily toil, paying visits to\r\ntheir sporting pals, attending dog shows, football matches, etc., taking\r\ntheir wives and children shopping, and on holidays going some distance\r\nafield--a local railway, even if close by, is of little use, with its\r\nrigid time-table, its fixed stopping-places, its high fares, and its\r\ngeneral formality. What they wanted, and what, until the introduction of\r\nelectric traction, they waited patiently for, was a service of\r\ncomfortable cars, that would pass their houses every few minutes, and\r\nwould take them long stages for, at the utmost, a twopenny fare.\r\n\r\nTo meet this want, in various parts of rural England, more especially in\r\nStaffordshire, horse and steam tramways were tried, but the latter\r\nmethod, from mechanical reasons, proved to be a failure. The rails\r\nweighed but 45 lbs. to the yard; they were set in iron chairs and laid\r\non wooden sleepers, and the engines were of the locomotive vertical\r\nboiler type. Soon it was found that the weight of the water damaged the\r\nlocomotive, and the incessant vibration and pounding shook the track so\r\nmuch as to necessitate constant renewal, and the expenditure became so\r\ngreat that many private Steam Tram Companies either wound up, were\r\nreconstructed, or were taken over by the local authorities.\r\n\r\nUnattractive was the appearance of these old-style tramcars--great\r\ncumbersome, top-heavy, two-storied structures, drawn by what looked like\r\na big iron box with a black funnel poking through its lid. They were\r\ndirty, they smelt, the service was irregular and slow, and the fares\r\nwere too high.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING CENTRES--GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\nStudying an up-to-date map of Great Britain, one is struck by the fact\r\nthat in the distribution of cities, towns, and villages it resembles the\r\nstellar system, with London as the governing central body, while lesser\r\nplanets, each surrounded by groups of satellites (not very bright ones,\r\nit is true), varying in size and importance, represent subordinate star\r\ncentres. These have grown, and still grow bigger and bigger, the suburbs\r\nof a large town reaching out farther and farther until they touch the\r\noutskirts of the next town, so that in some districts an overgrowth of\r\nhouses and factories covers many a square mile.\r\n\r\nIn the quiet old days that are gone, a working-man, particularly if a\r\nweaver, could labour far away in the country in some miniature workshop\r\nor in his own little room at home. But for years past he has been\r\ncompelled to trudge backwards and forwards to some big factory or mill,\r\nwhere steam-power was concentrated, and run upon so economical a\r\nprinciple, that outside of it the individual workman had no chance of\r\ngaining even the barest livelihood. With the advent of steam the\r\nvillages in certain parts of England were abandoned for the town, where\r\nclusters of great workshops had sprung up. A new order of things arose,\r\nand operatives, if they could, lived within the town boundaries. But as\r\nrates, taxes, and rent increased, they concentrated in outlying hamlets,\r\nwithin walking\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. VIEW NEAR DUDLEY STATION, SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE,\r\nSHOWING A STEAM TRAM-CAR]\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Manual of Electrical Undertakings, Ltd.,\r\nLondon_]\r\n\r\ndistance of their work. Thus these hamlets gradually became townlets,\r\nand eventually towns, which in their turn developed into centres of\r\nindustries--lesser lights revolving round the greater.\r\n\r\nAll over the kingdom manufacturing industries have a natural tendency to\r\nsettle down in particular localities favoured by the proximity of the\r\nraw material, and by railway or water facilities. Thus Dundee, Aberdeen,\r\nand the North of Ireland are associated with linen and strong textiles;\r\nthe Eastern counties and Lincolnshire with agriculture; Warwickshire and\r\nYorkshire with machinery; Burton-on-Trent with beer; Coventry and\r\nNottingham with cycles; and so on. Any intelligent schoolboy could reel\r\noff a list of such towns and their products.\r\n\r\nSwansea, with its great works for smelting copper and tin ore--the\r\nformer brought from South Australia, Chili, and Cornwall; the latter\r\nfrom the Straits Settlements and Cornwall--and its manufactories of tin\r\nplates, bolts, and zinc goods, is the centre for neighbouring towns\r\nassociated with its industries, such as Porth, Pontypridd, and Penarth,\r\nwhich, together with the Mumbles, are partially linked together by\r\ntramways.\r\n\r\nGlasgow, where shipbuilding, armour-plate rolling, and locomotive\r\nconstructing flourish, has around it the towns of Gourock, Greenock,\r\nRothesay, Coatbridge, and Bridge of Allan, all more or less commercially\r\ninterested in the great northern city.\r\n\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne and Sunderland, headquarters of England’s\r\nshipbuilding, are surrounded by places connected with or engaged in\r\nkindred industries, as Tynemouth, Stockton, the Hartlepools, Gateshead,\r\nJarrow, and North and South Shields--the last four practically suburbs\r\nof Newcastle--a fine field for electric tramways.\r\n\r\nThen in Yorkshire we have such centres of the linen and woollen\r\ninterests as Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield, Halifax, etc., begirt with\r\ntownlets which are in process of being interconnected; and further\r\nsouth, in South Lancashire, Burnley, Oldham, Ashton, Blackburn, Preston,\r\nRochdale, Bolton, Manchester, and Liverpool, together with endless\r\nsmaller places--every one of them engaged in our gigantic cotton\r\ntrade--cover large thickly populated areas, supplied with tramway means\r\nof intercommunication.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK COUNTRY AND THE POTTERIES\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of the localisation of special industries, and of\r\na city begirt with good-sized towns, is to be found in the South\r\nStaffordshire Black Country, its central sun being the city of\r\nBirmingham. While in the Potteries are a number of small towns almost\r\ntouching one another--star clusters, destined maybe eventually to\r\ncoalesce into a single planet of the first magnitude. Here humanity\r\nswarms.\r\n\r\nAlighting from a train at any wayside station in the South or West of\r\nEngland, if one walks along the main road, and avoids the villages, one\r\nmay go for miles without meeting a soul. The Londoner, whose nerves have\r\nbeen unstrung and jarred by incessant contact and friction with his\r\nfellow-citizens for months at a stretch, has only to journey a few\r\nmiles, say to Chertsey, Ewell, Epsom, or anywhere in Herts or Surrey,\r\nand in a few moments he finds a peaceful solitude not likely to be\r\ndisturbed save by passing cycles or motor-cars. But in the Midlands, and\r\nfor that matter anywhere in the North, it is different. There the bulk\r\nof Britain’s population is concentrated. One cannot go for a stroll\r\nwithout coming across individuals of all ages, who, although accustomed\r\nto see many people, stare at every stranger after a fashion unknown in\r\nthe home counties, as if he or she were a wanderer from another planet.\r\nAnd should it be a child whose curiosity is thus aroused, he will\r\nprobably follow the stranger for miles, gaping at nothing!\r\n\r\nIn the past, the manners and customs of the Black Country folk were\r\ndecidedly rough, based on the principle of a blow first and an\r\nexplanation afterwards. But this little trait has, under the modern\r\ninfluence of inter-communication with the outer world, been\r\nconsiderably modified. They work hard and “play” hard, and are given to\r\nweek-end excursions and an annual “outing” to Blackpool, Southport,\r\nLytham, or other favourite seaside resort. They earn good wages and, if\r\nsteady, quickly save money and live in comfortable houses of their own;\r\nbut if otherwise, their “good pay” only accelerates the wretchedness of\r\ntheir surroundings. Lavish with their cash, they are hospitable in the\r\nextreme; great consumers of plain beef and mutton, sweets and kickshaws\r\nthey relegate to the women and children; but they no longer--as was\r\naffirmed of puddlers and miners during the boom of many years ago--drink\r\nchampagne and feed their bull-pups on loin-chops and rump-steak. They\r\nare keen on dogs, pigeons, and singing-birds. Dog-fights are a thing of\r\nthe past, of course, but it is whispered that suspiciously high-bred\r\ngamecocks are still to be seen sub-rosa throughout the district!\r\n\r\nAltogether they are not half as black as they are painted; neither is\r\nthe aspect of their country, though except in the neighbourhood of\r\nBirmingham it can hardly be called picturesque. They represent the\r\nsturdy old Midland English, independent and brusque, whose confidence\r\nonce gained will not be betrayed.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in the country called “Black,” is a concentration of\r\nindustrial centres, each possessing great natural wealth of coal and\r\niron, and turning out in enormous quantities cutlery, anvils, bolts,\r\nbuttons, ironwork of all kinds, guns, hinges, locomotives, nails, pens,\r\npins, rails, rifles, screws, tin and zinc-lined goods, tools, tubes,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn its eighty-square-mile area, between Wolverhampton and the\r\nheadquarters of “Chamberlainism” on the one side, and Stourbridge and\r\nWalsall on the other, dwell over a million people, distributed among\r\nsome twenty-one towns ranging in size and population from Quarry Bank\r\n(8,000 inhabitants) to Wolverhampton (94,000), and including such\r\nfamiliar places as Handsworth (38,000), Stourbridge (17,000), Tipton\r\n(33,000), Wednesbury (29,000), and West Bromwich (68,000), all busily\r\nengaged in the industries before mentioned.\r\n\r\nSuch in a few words is the Black Country district, which the adjoining\r\nPotteries closely resembles. A more promising field for tramway\r\nenterprise could hardly exist. No wonder that George Francis Train in\r\n1860 selected North Staffordshire for one of his earliest, though\r\nunsuccessful, ventures--a two-mile tramway from Hartley to Burslem, in\r\nthe very heart of the Potteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ORDER OF RURAL TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\nSubsequently tramway companies came on the scene, with horses and steam\r\ntraction, and--in one instance--with electricity. There were five\r\ndistinct enterprises: the South Staffordshire Tramways Company, the\r\nBirmingham and Midland Tramways Company, the Dudley and Wolverhampton\r\nTramways Company, the Wolverhampton Tramways Company, and the Dudley,\r\nStourbridge, and District Electric Traction Company (a short line of\r\nabout four miles).\r\n\r\nNot only were these lines entirely separated and disconnected, involving\r\ntedious changing of cars, but two of the five were actually of different\r\ngauge from the rest, making through communication impossible. It was no\r\nsystem, merely a conglomeration of _disjecta membra_. The tramway\r\ncondition of the district became thoroughly unsatisfactory, utterly\r\ninadequate to the needs of the travelling public. Matters gradually went\r\nfrom bad to worse, and a financial Lord Kitchener was urgently needed to\r\nremodel everything.\r\n\r\nHe appeared in the form of a powerful organisation, the British Electric\r\nTraction Company, with a share capital of £4,000,000, which entered into\r\nnegotiations with the various companies and with the local authorities\r\ncontrolling no fewer than twenty-two districts, into which the Black\r\nCountry area is divided. The proposition was to combine all the Black\r\nCountry tramways into one great system to be worked by electricity in\r\nthe most up-to-date manner, to give frequent service, to ensure rapid\r\nand comfortable communication between all parts, to straighten things\r\nout well, and to adopt this motto, “One management, one method, one\r\ngauge,” provided the local authorities would for some years suspend\r\ntheir rights under the Acts of 1870 and 1896 to buy the tramways for\r\npractically the worth of old iron.\r\n\r\nSome of the local authorities thought well of it. Others did not,\r\ncontending that they, and not the Company, ought to undertake the\r\nreform; while the rest saddled their adherence to the scheme with such\r\nimpossible conditions, that the negotiations dragged wearily on, and it\r\nwas some time before the great scheme was finally carried through at the\r\ncost of much trouble with the local authorities in the matter of routes\r\nselected for the requisite extensions. In one instance the line,\r\ninstead\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. VIEW AT CASTLE HILL, DUDLEY, SOUTH\r\nSTAFFORDSHIRE. SHOWING AN ELECTRIC TRAM-CAR\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Manual of Electrical Undertakings, Ltd.,\r\nLondon._]\r\n\r\nof being carried in the natural way direct to the urban boundaries of a\r\nlarge town, was compelled by the authorities of the area involved to\r\nturn off at an angle and to gain access to the town in an utterly\r\nroundabout fashion, much as if in London, one was obliged in approaching\r\nSt. Paul’s by Ludgate Hill to deflect up the Old Bailey, and to reach\r\nthe cathedral by way of Newgate Street.\r\n\r\nOne thing only is still wanted to make this Light Railway scheme\r\n(typical of other similar ones) perfect, and this is that its cars\r\nshould have running powers right into Birmingham and other large towns,\r\nand it is to be hoped that before this book is published they will be\r\ngranted. Travellers do not want to change cars when they arrive at the\r\nmunicipal boundary. They want to move from one centre of population to\r\nthe other, to get in at the Birmingham starting-point, and to get out in\r\nthe centre of Walsall, West Bromwich, or Wolverhampton, as the case may\r\nbe, or even to go without changing as far as Kinver, on the edge of the\r\nBlack Country, a favourite holiday resort hitherto inaccessible to the\r\nmanufacturing population.\r\n\r\nIn the North Staffordshire Potteries the British Electric Traction\r\nCompany has pursued the same policy as in the Black Country with\r\nexcellent result, as may be judged by the number of passengers in 1901.\r\nIn the Potteries and the Black Country many millions made use of the\r\ntramways, the system throughout being that of the overhead trolley, and\r\nthe combined length of track about 75 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES AND RURAL TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\nThe whole question of local authority in its relation to rural tramways\r\nneeds settling on a sound common-sense\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. CAMPS BAY, CAPE TOWN, AND SEAPOINT TRAMWAYS\r\n\r\n_By Permission of_ _Dick Kerr & Co., London._]\r\n\r\nbasis, making the requirements of travellers the dominating object to\r\nthe exclusion of petty differences and local aspirations and\r\njealousy.[7]\r\n\r\nIf Great Britain is to be networked with these handy means of transport,\r\nand the interspaces of town and village bridged over with cobweb lines\r\nof trams, an Act of Parliament should settle a universal gauge, and on\r\nequitable terms provide for free running powers, whether in town or\r\ncountry, and encourage an interchange of traffic.\r\n\r\nIt is constantly urged that it is better for cities and great towns to\r\ncreate tramway lines of their own, and work them within their own\r\nboundaries, and that the task of dealing with the rural interspaces\r\nshould be left to the small towns and areas, and not to private\r\nenterprise. The opponents of this principle argue that one great\r\nobjection to municipal trams is that they are compelled to work within\r\nartificial local boundaries, and that there are grave drawbacks to\r\nmunicipal trading in any form. As to the interspaces, to work them by\r\nthemselves would never pay, and any interspaced tramway system would be\r\nalmost useless without intimate connection with urban centres as\r\nfeeders, which is only obtainable by the uniform control afforded under\r\njoint stock enterprise. Besides--say the objectors to municipal or rural\r\ncouncil control--if private working is the most economical way of\r\nrunning tramways in interspaces, it should be still more economical in\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nSurely, therefore, there would be no hardship in restricting the\r\ndevelopment of urban and rural tramways to local authorities wielding\r\npower over areas of a certain size and importance, and the loss to small\r\ncommunities of the power of objection or veto to large schemes ought not\r\nto be felt by them. They and the landowners should take warning from the\r\nhistory of railways, and encourage in every way the introduction and\r\nextension of tramways, which in remote districts would vastly relieve\r\nthe tedium of existence, enabling labourers and others to temporarily\r\nexchange some dull little village for the comparatively lively market\r\ntown at a nominal cost. Whereas, in many instances, instead of welcoming\r\nthis herald of a brighter and less monotonous life, too often is\r\nrepeated the scene immortalised in _Punch_ some years ago. A brickfield:\r\n“Bill, who’s that chap?” “Do’ant know. A stranger, I should think.”\r\n“Then heave ’arf a brick at his ’ed.”\r\n\r\nCapitalists should be encouraged to embark in tramway enterprises that\r\nare bound to be beneficial to everybody, and in which they would be\r\nentitled to a fair return of interest; for truly the labourer is worthy\r\nof his reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_THE SHALLOW UNDERGROUND SYSTEM_\r\n\r\n    “Through the faithless excavated soil\r\n     See the unweary’d Briton delves his way.”\r\n                               BLACKMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN LONDON\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been considering Metropolitan Electric Railways\r\nconstructed at considerable depths below the surface, or lifted up on\r\nhigh, as at the Liverpool Docks.\r\n\r\nThere is another system, however, and one that is strongly advocated by\r\nthe London County Council, at present chiefly as a means of linking\r\ntogether existing tram lines by taking the cars underground through\r\ncongested areas and bringing them to the surface again where the traffic\r\nis less dense.\r\n\r\nIn its ever-increasing congested condition, London reminds us of a\r\npatient afflicted with dropsy of long standing, susceptible to\r\noccasional alleviation, but hopelessly incurable. In Tudor, Stuart, and\r\nHanoverian days the town gave no signs of this malady; but with Queen\r\nVictoria’s reign the germs of it became evident, and now the giant city\r\nlies prostrate in a state of helplessness that has baffled the most\r\nskilful engineering physicians, whose remedies, trains and trams and\r\ntubes, have been successful only in giving temporary relief to the\r\nsufferer, who forthwith resumes and even increases his original bulk.\r\n\r\nFor ages the ocean, without breaking its bounds, has absorbed the rivers\r\nand streams running into it; but imagine the process reversed, and the\r\nEnglish and Irish Channels and the North Sea unrestrictedly pouring\r\ntheir torrents into the Thames, the Forth, or the Liffey! Only one\r\nresult could ensue. The channels thus gorged with water, their currents\r\nwould cease to flow. A similar fate threatens London, into whose narrow\r\nand inelastic fairways an Atlantic of traffic is ever pouring. One day\r\nthe current will be unable to flow, and there will be a permanent\r\ncondition of “block.” Then, and only then, perhaps, will a partial\r\nmigration of town to country bring about a more natural state of things,\r\nand save this colossal city from utter collapse.\r\n\r\nThese shallow tramways of the London County Council are a novelty in\r\nEngland, but on a large scale have been successfully adopted in Paris,\r\nBuda-Pesth, Boston, and New York. At present the shallow subway which\r\nthe Council has been authorised to construct at a total cost of\r\n£279,000, commences at Theobald’s Road, Holborn, where it forms a\r\njunction with an existing surface tramway, the property of the Council.\r\nThence the line falls in level, until, in Southampton Row, it runs\r\nbeneath the street, whence, in a trench of inconsiderable depth, it\r\npasses along the new thoroughfare, Kingsway, from Southampton Row to the\r\nnew Strand crescent, Aldwych. There it turns towards the Embankment, on\r\ngaining which near Waterloo Bridge it again comes out to the surface. In\r\nits total length of about five-eighths of a mile it has four stations.\r\nIts motive power is electricity on the underground conduit third rail\r\nsystem. The cars, running singly, and at frequent intervals, are\r\nsingle-decked. It claims for its principle that the station platforms\r\nare readily accessible, so that instead of having to descend a great\r\nnumber of steps, or to enter a lift to reach the cars, passengers arrive\r\nthere by means of a short well-lighted stairway; that the ventilation of\r\nthe tunnels is perfect, and the speed of the cars equal to that of the\r\ntrains, and as they run singly and close together, long waits are\r\navoided, and thus they are specially suited for short-distance\r\ntravelling. It also claims a general immunity from vibration.\r\n\r\nTo thoroughly understand how a complete system of shallow underground\r\nworks we must go abroad to Paris, Buda-Pesth, Boston, and New York. I\r\nmay remark that in describing this system a certain amount of repetition\r\nis inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARIS\r\n\r\nParis has its “Twopenny Tube,” or rather its equivalent. On July 30th,\r\n1900, Londoners for the first time travelled by a deep-level line from\r\nthe City to Shepherds Bush, a distance of 5·77 miles; and a few days\r\nearlier, on the 19th of the same month, the Electrical Chemin de Fer\r\nMétropolitain de Paris--the main channel of an elaborate system that\r\nlinks together every district of the capital--was opened for traffic.\r\nThis chief artery connects at the fortifications, the Porte Maillot with\r\nthe Porte de Vincennes, a distance of 6·6 miles. In other words, it\r\ncrosses Paris diagonally from north-west to south-east; from a point at\r\nthe north of the Bois de Boulogne to another at the north of the Bois de\r\nVincennes; the eighteen stations (including terminals) on the main line\r\nbeing Porte Maillot, Rue D’Obligado, Place de L’Etoile (Arc de\r\nTriomphe), Avenue de L’Alma, Rue Marbœuf, Champs Elyseés, Place de la\r\nConcorde, Tuileries, Palais Royal, Louvre, Châtelet, Hotel de Ville,\r\nSt. Paul, Place de la Bastille, Gare de Lyons, Rue de Reuilly, Place de\r\nla Nation, and Porte de Vincennes.\r\n\r\nOn the Métropolitain there is a three-minutes’ service of trains during\r\nthe day, and a six-minutes’ service at night. On the London Tube the\r\nintervals vary from two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half minutes in the\r\nday, while at night they are the same as in Paris, both railways being\r\nopen for some twenty hours out of the twenty-four.\r\n\r\nIn Paris two classes of passengers are provided for: first and second.\r\nThe former are called upon to pay 2½_d._, the latter 1½_d._, for any\r\nlength of journey. Up to nine a.m., second-class, or workmen’s tickets,\r\nare issued for 2_d._, the return half being available for the remainder\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nThus, as regards date of opening, length of line, service of trains, and\r\naverage fares, there is a close similarity between the English and\r\nFrench lines; but the system is widely different. In London we burrow\r\ndeep; in Paris they go just beneath the surface, the authorities after\r\nmuch hesitation having adopted the shallow underground system. Our Tube\r\ntrains are shot through huge iron pipes penetrating the subsoil at\r\ndepths varying from sixty to a hundred feet, and to get at the rail\r\nlevel, passengers must take a perpendicular journey in a big lift. But\r\ntheir Parisian counterparts trip down a few steps and along a\r\nbrightly-lighted, white-tiled tunnel, so beautifully ventilated and\r\nsmokeless--electricity being the motive power--that an enthusiastic\r\nexpert declares its atmosphere to be “perfectly clean and sweet.” The\r\ntunnels are as near the surface as possible, and on the greater part of\r\nthe line the keystones of the masonry arches are only about 3 feet 6\r\ninches below the street level. The excavations were at first attempted\r\nby means of shields, as in “tubular” work; but this had to be abandoned\r\nin favour of the time-honoured “cut and cover” plan employed in the\r\nconstruction of our early underground railway.\r\n\r\nWhen the great Parisian scheme is completed upon a twentieth-century\r\nmodel, much more finished and convenient in many ways than any of ours\r\nin London, it will comprise a total length of 38·86 miles of track,\r\nseven-tenths being laid in shallow covered trenches, the remainder in\r\nopen cuttings or on viaducts, the entire cost being estimated at twelve\r\nmillion sterling. An interesting feature of the scheme is that each\r\nsection is self-contained and ends in loops, so that shunting is\r\nobviated. No trains run from any one distant strip of line into another,\r\nbut where there are crossings, or where the termini touch, there are\r\nstations to facilitate changing. This arrangement ensures a rapid\r\nservice, maintained with regularity and punctuality on each section.\r\nLike our “Tube,” the success of the Parisian Métropolitain was from the\r\nfirst immense, and at the end of ten months showed a return of over\r\nforty million passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDA-PESTH\r\n\r\nAlong the Boulevard Andrassy at Buda-Pesth there is a shallow electric\r\ntramway built upon similar principles, a few feet under the main\r\nthoroughfare, which is by no means a failure, financially or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON\r\n\r\nNow let us cross the Atlantic, and note what has been effected at Boston\r\nand New York.\r\n\r\nThe former--the picturesque old-world capital of the State of\r\nMassachusetts, with its population of over a million--is familiarised\r\nto every schoolboy who knows anything of history and the War of\r\nIndependence, with the city where the tea was thrown into the harbour by\r\nColonials disguised as Mohawks, an incident that indirectly brought\r\nabout the creation of the United States. It is a city also sacred to\r\nliterati as being the home of Nathaniel Hawthorne, and is so\r\nold-fashioned--or so excessively up-to-date, whichever you please--that,\r\nuntil recently, neither cabs, omnibuses, tubes, or underground railways\r\nwere to be found within its boundaries. What with the uneven surface and\r\nthe labyrinth of the streets, Boston is picturesque in spite of itself,\r\nand its old buildings emphasize this. There are the two New England\r\nmeeting-houses. The “Old South” has been proudly preserved in its\r\nancient state, although the ground on which it stands is almost as\r\nvaluable as that in the City of London. Architecturally, it is a brick\r\nbarn, with a pretentiously ugly steeple. “Old North” has an equally\r\nplain body, but from its steeple, as a tablet affixed to it sets forth,\r\n“the signal lantern of Paul Revere warned the country of the march of\r\nthe British troops to Lexington and Concord.” King’s Chapel, another\r\necclesiastical antiquity of Boston, was, for a quarter of a century\r\nafter 1749, the place of worship of the official British colony, and\r\naccordingly became an eyesore to the earnest puritanical Bostonians.\r\n\r\nBut Boston cannot, like Charlestown, South Carolina, boast of a St.\r\nMichael’s Church, famous for its beautiful steeple, so greatly\r\nresembling that of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields as to suggest that\r\nprobably they were both designed by the same architect, Gibbs, one of\r\nWren’s pupils.\r\n\r\nIn the Act passed by the State Legislature authorising the construction\r\nof the Boston subway, it was stipulated that its length should be some\r\nfive miles, and its total cost not more than one and a half million\r\npounds sterling.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the subway was begun at the Public Gardens, where an\r\nincline, a hundred yards long, carries the surface lines into the\r\ntunnel, passing under the edge of Boston Common to Tremont Street. It is\r\njoined by a branch subway from Pleasant Street, where another incline\r\nleads to the surface. From this junction the subway proceeds beneath the\r\nTremont Street side of the Common to Park Street, which is the central\r\npoint of the system. Thence it is carried directly beneath Tremont\r\nStreet to Scollay Square, and by means of a bifurcation under Hanover\r\nStreet on the one hand and Cornhill on the other to a junction under\r\nWashington Street. The tunnel continues under Washington Street to\r\nHaymarket Square, and immediately rises by an incline to Causeway\r\nStreet, where it connects with both the surface and the elevated lines.\r\nWherever possible, the subway was carried out by open excavations, and,\r\nas in the Paris Métropolitain, by the old-fashioned “cut and cover”\r\nmethod. The roof of the tunnel is generally about three feet below the\r\nsurface, though in some places considerably lower. At and near the\r\nstations the subway sides are lined with white glazed bricks, whitewash\r\nbeing used elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are five stations in the Boston shallow underground, viz. at\r\nBoylston Street, Park Street, Adams Square, Scollay Square, and\r\nHaymarket Square. These are approached by short stairways, protected\r\nfrom the weather by neat clock-surmounted kiosks, or small iron\r\nstructures, in shape resembling our cab shelters, and placed at\r\nconvenient points, either on the sidewalks or--where there is sufficient\r\nwidth--in the centre of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. BOSTON SUBWAY, SHOWING ENTRANCE AT THE PUBLIC\r\nGARDENS\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _London County Council_]\r\n\r\nroadway. Passengers can thus, by about twenty-five steps, go to and from\r\nthe platforms in a few seconds. The ticket-offices are at the bottom of\r\nthe stairways. The passenger returns at Park Street (the busiest\r\nstation) are among the largest in the world, being 28,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe Boston surface street cars adopt the overhead trolley principle of\r\nelectric traction, and the elevated railway-cars the third rail system,\r\nboth these systems being continued throughout the subway.\r\n\r\nThe subway is illuminated electrically, but a considerable amount of\r\nnatural light is also obtained, especially at the stations; and Captain\r\nPiper, deputy of the New York Police, when on a visit to London last\r\nFebruary, discussing the question of ventilation in tube railways, gave\r\nit as his opinion that the freshest air he had “struck” in an\r\nunderground railway was at Boston. “The air,” he said, “is excellent.”\r\n\r\nThe subway is, of course, perfectly clean, smokeless, and comparatively\r\nquiet; neither in the streets can any noise be heard from the cars that\r\nare continually passing close beneath. By an extension of the subway\r\nunder Boston harbour, the surface lines in the district of East Boston\r\nare connected with the main system, thus making the entire length eight\r\nmiles of single track.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\nIn New York, after much careful consideration of the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of deep tunnels (tubes) and shallow railways, the Rapid\r\nTransit Commissioners decided upon the latter as being likely to give\r\nthe best facilities for quick travelling. On account of its peculiar\r\npeninsular shape, admitting of extension in one direction\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. NEW YORK SUBWAY IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION. CAR\r\nTRAFFIC MAINTAINED\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _London County Council_]\r\n\r\nonly, the problem of transportation in the Empire City is comparatively\r\neasy, the routes being straight, and no necessity existing for\r\nintercommunication as in London. But, on the other hand, the number of\r\npersons to be carried morning and evening is greater.\r\n\r\nInstead of the arched roof and masonry side-walks of the ordinary\r\nunderground, there is a rectangular structure with a framework of steel\r\nbeams riveted together, concrete enclosing the erection completely at\r\nthe top and sides, and forming the bottom, rows of steel columns helping\r\nto support the roof between the tracks--in other words, a kind of\r\nBritannia Bridge let into the surface of the earth. The line has four\r\ntracks, the two centre ones being reserved for an express service (30\r\nmiles an hour), with stations 1½ miles apart. On the other tracks the\r\nstations are closer together, about four to the mile. So that there are\r\ntwo kinds of stations; one with platforms on the outside of the outer\r\n(or slow) track (at which only local trains stop), and another with\r\nplatforms for fast trains only, and island platforms for either local or\r\nexpress trains. At the former stations the subway is sufficiently deep\r\nto allow of a bridge over the entire four tracks, with staircases\r\nleading to the various platforms. By means of loops, and, in places, by\r\nthe lowering of the express track beneath the local tracks, crossings\r\nand switchings at the termini are, as in the Paris Métropolitain,\r\neliminated, and the cars run continuously without any shunting whatever.\r\n\r\nIts general scheme is as follows. Starting with a loop round the General\r\nPost Office, a four-track route is taken direct to the Grand Central\r\nStation in 42nd Street. It then turns west along 42nd Street to\r\nBroadway, and proceeds under Broadway to 104th Street, a distance of\r\nseven miles. Here the four tracks divide, a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. NEW YORK SUBWAY, SHOWING HOW IT WAS BUILT\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _London County Council_]\r\n\r\ndouble track continuing along Broadway to Kingsbridge, and another\r\ndouble track going in an easterly direction under the Harlem river to\r\nthe Bronx district. Each of these branches is seven miles long, making a\r\ntotal length, for the whole system, of twenty-one miles, seven being for\r\nfour track and fourteen for double track. The northerly ends of the\r\ndouble-track line are on the surface for a combined distance of about\r\nfive miles, the remainder being shallow underground. At convenient\r\npoints inclines lead to the surface from the subway, and are linked to\r\nstreet trams and elevated railroads. Electricity is exclusively used for\r\ntraction and lighting, and the cost of the entire scheme was originally\r\nestimated at £7,000,000.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the conclusion to be come to as to the adaptability of the\r\nshallow underground system to our vast metropolis, whose station at\r\nLiverpool Street is the busiest in the world, with its “turnover” of\r\nforty-five millions of passengers per annum; St. Lazare, at Paris,\r\ncoming next with forty-three millions?\r\n\r\nIn newly-constructed thoroughfares provision for shallow subways, and\r\nfor sewers, pipes, cables, etc., can be easily made; but in\r\nold-established streets the difficulty and expense in making them would\r\nbe formidable, as vaults and cellars used for business purposes\r\nfrequently extend right across the narrow carriageways, and a perfect\r\nnetwork of conduits would have to be displaced and moved either below or\r\nalongside the subway.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the cost of interfering with sewers may be gathered by the\r\nfact that in constructing the New York subway an entirely new outfall\r\nsewer, over six feet in diameter, had to be built one mile in length! On\r\nthe other hand, labour is cheaper in this country than in America, and\r\nin London there is no rock to be removed as in New York.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would quote from the report of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nYorke, who was sent over to Paris two or three years ago by the Board of\r\nTrade to inspect the Métropolitain. He thinks that as regards\r\nconvenience for passengers and economy of working, the balance of\r\nadvantage lies with the shallow tunnel or subway as compared with the\r\ndeep-level tube. But he hesitates a little when confronted with the\r\nthought of what would happen to London while its roadways were in\r\nprocess of being undermined. The difficulties in the way of adopting the\r\nsubway would, he says, be great, though he does not emphatically declare\r\nthat he considers them prohibitive; and he approves of the attempt made\r\nto introduce the system in the manner adopted by the London County\r\nCouncil beneath the new street between Holborn and the Strand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_HORSELESS VEHICLES--ELECTRICAL AND OTHERWISE_\r\n\r\n“Cars without horses will go.”--MOTHER SHIPTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVATE MOTOR-CARS\r\n\r\nThe above prediction, constantly quoted at the advent of railways, is\r\nbeing realised with the utmost exactness. Except the late craze for\r\ncycling, nothing is more remarkable than the boom in the motor-car.\r\n\r\nPrior to the passing of the “Locomotives on Highways Act” in 1896,\r\nmotoring was an impossibility. Even then its advance was slow, and until\r\nabout three years ago motor-cars were decidedly unpopular. The London\r\nstreet boys--miniature representatives of public opinion--derided them,\r\nand, with their usual fiendish lack of sympathy, rejoiced when they came\r\nto grief; while ’bus-drivers and cabmen ironically likened all\r\nautomobiles to traction engines, cherishing the delusion that they\r\ncontinually broke down, cost a small fortune to maintain, and, worse\r\nthan all, dislocated every bone in their occupants’ bodies.\r\n\r\nThis contempt reached a climax when certain lemon-coloured electric cabs\r\nwere seen plying for hire, ugly to look at and limited in speed; while\r\nsimultaneously a line of steam omnibuses, so cumbersome and weighty\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. ELECTRIC CARRIAGE ENTIRELY OF BRITISH\r\nCONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n_By permission of_ _Henry F. Joel & Co., London_]\r\n\r\nas to really merit comparison with traction engines, began to run to\r\nVictoria Station.\r\n\r\nBut an extraordinary and rapid change has come over popular taste, and\r\nnothing is needed to bring motor-cars into universal use, save a\r\nlowering of their cost; for even the cheapest are rather beyond the\r\nmeans of people with moderate incomes. This may be one reason why they\r\nare so fashionable, though the King’s marked predilection for travelling\r\nby them has done much to make “motoring” the correct thing; and His\r\nMajesty has recently consented to become a patron of the Automobile\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of the motor-car, Society, though tired of “biking”\r\nand craving for a novelty, could not tolerate the notion of being seen\r\nin any other than a well-horsed vehicle. Society now thinks differently,\r\nas evidenced by a stroll in the Park during the season. There, in the\r\nmidst of graceful landaus and other equipages drawn by the most splendid\r\nhorses in the world, may be seen endless electric and steam barouches,\r\nbroughams, victorias, and cars, all perfectly noiseless, and magnificent\r\npetrol motor-cars (_not_ noiseless!), resplendent with brass and\r\noxidised silver fittings and upholstered in morocco, whose fair\r\noccupants are smartly dressed in tailor-made motoring gowns or, on warm\r\ndays, in ordinary carriage toilettes.\r\n\r\nSome of the fashionable hotels own big cars and run them in lieu of\r\ncoaches for their customers’ benefit to various places near London;\r\nwhile, to the vexation of omnibus companies, motor waggonettes, duly\r\nauthorised by Scotland Yard, ply to and from Putney and Piccadilly\r\nCircus, always “full up” with people, no longer the butt (as they used\r\nto be), but the envy, of pedestrians. And these public cars, though not\r\nperfect, are an advance upon omnibuses, and do not break down more\r\nfrequently than horsed conveyances.\r\n\r\nIn the country motor-cars have become indispensable, more especially to\r\nlanded proprietors, with houses always full of visitors who, with their\r\nluggage, have to be conveyed to and from the station. They are much used\r\nfor race-meetings and for conveying shooting parties to the covert side,\r\nstubble, or moor, in comfort, golfers to the links, and fishermen to the\r\nriverbank; picnics would be failures without them; and delightful\r\nexcursions to all kinds of outlying places are arranged by the host,\r\nproud of “motoring” his guests, who thus are made acquainted with bits\r\nof beautiful scenery they would otherwise have remained ignorant of; as\r\nin the case of the King’s and Queen’s visit to Chatsworth last January,\r\nwhen a feature of the programme was a series of motor-car tours in North\r\nand West Derbyshire. In fact, the motor is a most important factor in\r\nEnglish country life, and the art of managing it is gradually\r\nsuperseding that of riding, driving, and four-in-hand coaching. Eheu!\r\n\r\nHorseless vehicles are not actual novelties. They have merely been in\r\nabeyance while the perfecting of our iron roads has proceeded. The\r\nearliest practical specimen emanated from an inventor named Guyniot a\r\nhundred and thirty years ago, but nothing commercially serious came of\r\nit, and the idea slept. In 1786 William Symington produced his\r\nsteam-engine, to run upon an ordinary road. It had the condenser and the\r\nratchet-motion used in his steamboat, an invention of which he was the\r\noriginator. The boiler and funnel were in the front, a coach on\r\nC-springs between them, and the steering gear, with a kind of bicycle\r\nhandle-bar, at the rear. The machine, it was said, worked well.\r\n\r\nThen, in 1821, a steam-coach by Griffiths attracted much attention,\r\nbeing the first self-propelled vehicle to ply for passengers on British\r\nroads. It had a boiler with water-tubes as now used in the Serpollet and\r\nBelleville systems for motor-cars. In appearance it somewhat resembled\r\nthe Symington, but carried a double coach mounted on railway springs.\r\n\r\nWalter Hancock’s three-wheeled steam-coach of 1828 looked like a\r\ntricycle with a big funnel, and was propelled by a pair of oscillating\r\ncylinders working the double-cranked axle of the steering-wheel.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the Marquis of Stafford had a steam-coach built that weighed\r\nless than a ton. With its chain-action it anticipated the modern\r\nbicycle: in front it had a kind of bath-chair seat facing the steering\r\ngear. In this vehicle Lord Stafford and party of three made trips at\r\nfrom nine to twelve miles an hour over heavy roads without any\r\ndifficulty, it being easy to guide and remarkably steady. In these steam\r\ncoaches the funnels appear to have been placed in the rear.\r\n\r\nAll these ideas, though from one point of view crude, undoubtedly\r\nrepresented\r\n\r\n    “...such refraction of events\r\n     As often rises ere they rise.”\r\n\r\nThe motor-car industry in Great Britain is flourishing, and it is\r\nestimated that out of a total of some ten thousand horseless carriages\r\nin the country one-tenth are of home manufacture (the remainder being\r\nFrench or American), a small proportion, truly, but a great increase\r\nupon the number built in 1890; and at the Reliability Trials of the\r\nAutomobile Club last September (1902), thirty-five of British make took\r\npart in the contest, and only twenty-six of Continental or American\r\norigin, a most satisfactory feature to those who are eager to see\r\nBritish makers second to none in motor-car construction, especially, as\r\nthe aim of the competition was to encourage the building of machines\r\nthat would be thoroughly dependable in all conditions of road and\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. A “CROWDUS” ELECTRIC CARRIAGE\r\n\r\n_By permission of the Fischer Motor Vehicle Syndicate, London._]\r\n\r\nAt the last Crystal Palace Automobile Show, national vanity was\r\ncertainly gratified. Not only was the exhibition the largest ever held\r\nin the country, but was a concrete example of the remarkable progress of\r\nan industry which, so far as these islands are concerned, started\r\nlamentably late in the day. There were brought together at the Crystal\r\nPalace about seven hundred and fifty motor-propelled vehicles of every\r\nclass, ranging from the powerful steam lorry, capable of transporting a\r\nload of 7½ tons, to the latest “flier,” light and elegant of\r\nconstruction, and costing anything up to some £3,000. Motor tricycles\r\nand bicycles formed a strong section. The cosmopolitan character of the\r\nexhibition is shown by the fact that among the two hundred or so\r\nexhibitors were the leading English, French, Dutch, Italian, and German\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\nBy general consent the show was regarded to have made plain the fact\r\nthat in efficiency and reliability the English maker has drawn at least\r\nlevel with his foreign rival, while, so far as the production of motors\r\nfor _commercial_ purposes is concerned, he still stands far ahead.\r\n\r\nAutomobiles are of all sizes up to magnificent 40-or 60-horse-power\r\nracers. For town use there are broughams, victorias, landaus, and\r\nlandaulettes (open or closable for country work), the phaeton with four\r\nseats, placed two by two, looking forward, and the tonneau--a kind of\r\nsmall omnibus with a movable back--with the two rear seats in the\r\ncorners.\r\n\r\nSometimes cars are run with six seats arranged in three pairs, with\r\nplenty of room both for the driver and the coveted box-seats. Most cars\r\nof either pattern have a glass front screen, while some have a fixed\r\nroof as well. The greater number are driven by the use of petrol, the\r\nmachinery being in front under what is called the “bonnet,” and the ease\r\nwith which the oil can be obtained has great advantages for a touring\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nSteam is also employed for motor-cars, and is practically noiseless, but\r\nthere are obvious objections to its use, however skilfully the working\r\nparts are constructed.\r\n\r\nIn London, electromobiles are extremely popular, and no wonder, for\r\nthere is no smell, no vibration, and no noise; the speed attainable is\r\ngreat, and they are under perfect control, advantages involving the use\r\nof storage batteries, the recharging of which is a lengthy operation,\r\nseldom taking less than five hours. But, as Mr. Llewellyn Preece\r\nobserved about twelve months\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. AN ELECTRIC VICTORIA WITH BRITISH\r\nSTORAGE-BATTERIES\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Electric Power Storage Co., Ltd., London_]\r\n\r\nago, “this condition of affairs is gradually disappearing; private\r\nelectric carriages are now to be seen in London, and their number is\r\nincreasing. Cars can be obtained capable of running to Brighton,\r\nPortsmouth, and other places within seventy or eighty miles of the\r\nmetropolis.” (_i.e._ on one charge. They may be called “short-tour\r\ncars.”)\r\n\r\nElectric town-cars are generally of the landaulette type--for\r\ntheatre-going, and for paying visits in such inaccessible suburbs as\r\nStoke Newington, Balham, and Hampstead. They carry from two to four\r\npassengers, can attain a speed of fourteen miles an hour, and will run\r\nforty miles without recharging.\r\n\r\nA long-distance electric car, to compete with petrol, has yet to be\r\nmade, but it will shortly be possible to obtain one of moderate weight\r\nat a reasonable price that will cover one hundred and twenty miles on a\r\nsingle charge; and, as a matter of fact, tours of more than a thousand\r\nmiles (from London to Glasgow and back) have been satisfactorily\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC CONVEYANCES\r\n\r\nThe perfect motor-omnibus, and, for that matter, the perfect ’bus of any\r\nkind, has yet to arise, and is suggestive of Darwinism in the length of\r\ntime required for its evolution. But can London and the long-suffering\r\ntraveller wait ten million years or so--putting up meanwhile with the\r\ninconvenience of existing vehicles--until the omnibus companies wake up,\r\nor are superseded by more enterprising business adventurers?\r\n\r\nWhy, for instance, should all omnibuses be stuffy? There was a reason\r\nfor it when their floors were covered with straw and they were shut in\r\nwith doors. But now there are no doors, and there is nothing to harbour\r\ndamp; yet even when the passengers sitting at the entrance of the\r\nomnibus are assailed by icy blasts, those at the far end are in an\r\natmosphere of mustiness strongly suggestive of stables. Then, on days\r\nwhen the roads are greasy, these vehicles crawl along, often taking an\r\nhour and a half to travel from Fulham to Liverpool Street (a distance of\r\nabout six miles). Upon such minor nuisances and annoyances as the\r\nexiguous space (about 2 feet 6 inches) between the seats, ticket-giving\r\nand ticket-examining, the jarring of brakes, the rattling of loose\r\ncoach-bolts, the lurching of the top-heavy structure, the windows that\r\nwill not open, the glare and dust in summer, the Cimmerian darkness in\r\nwinter and at night, the stout people who take up too much room, the wet\r\numbrellas and odoriferous waterproof cloaks, the exasperating and often\r\nunnecessary stopping every few hundred yards to the distress of the poor\r\nanimals, it is needless to dilate. We experience them every day of our\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nBut better times are in store for the horses, and better times for our\r\nchildren (perhaps even for ourselves), who will see in London’s streets\r\nelectric omnibuses in which it will be a delight to travel.\r\n\r\nBetween Oxford Circus and Cricklewood (not far from Hendon) are now\r\nrunning improved motor-omnibuses built in Scotland for a London\r\nsyndicate, to the requirements of the Chief Commissioner of Police. It\r\nwill be remembered that some years ago a very large Thorneycroft steam\r\n’bus plied for custom. It carried thirty-six passengers, but, turning\r\nthe scale at three tons, it was of illegal weight as a vehicle, and\r\nshould have come under the definition of a traction engine with speed\r\nlimited to four miles an hour, and preceded by a man with a red flag. So\r\nit was ultimately withdrawn.\r\n\r\nBut the new “Stirling” steam omnibuses are only 32 cwt. when empty. The\r\nengine is of 12 horse-power, and is geared for three forward speeds of\r\n4½, 9, and 14 miles per hour, with one slow reversing speed, while by a\r\nclever contrivance the driving machinery ceases to act if 14·2 miles be\r\nexceeded, both steering gear and brakes being under perfect control.\r\nHandsomely fitted up, with large windows that can be taken bodily out in\r\nhot weather, and with comfortable leather-covered spring seats, the new\r\n’buses are a decided step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting of the London General Omnibus Company the\r\ndeputy-chairman stated that there was no kind of motor traction that\r\nwould pay the company to take up. If anything was done in that direction\r\nit would be in the use of petrol. Steam was of no use, because of the\r\ngreat vibration, and he doubted if the Government would permit 15,000\r\nsuch omnibuses to run over the streets. In his opinion the time to take\r\nup motor omnibuses had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nBut the London Road Car Company has taken a different and more\r\nfar-sighted view of the situation, and a combination of petrol and\r\nelectricity is now to be tested by it.\r\n\r\nCars of the Fischer combination pattern have arrived from America. Each\r\nhas a 10 horse-power petrol engine which drives a dynamo, the current\r\nfrom which is used to work a motor acting directly on the wheels.\r\n\r\nThis may, perhaps, seem a needless complication, but there is much\r\nmethod in it. A 10 horse-power engine is not sufficiently powerful to\r\ndrive a fully-laden ’bus up a hill at any reasonable pace, but there are\r\nmany places where a ’bus will run by its own weight, and needs no\r\nengine. The new car is provided with accumulators. When little or no\r\npower is required by the motor, the current is switched on to the\r\naccumulators, so as to store up a reserve for hill-climbing. So when\r\nnecessary, the car draws on the reserve in the accumulators, and with\r\nthem and the dynamo develops not 10 but 20 horse-power, enough to take\r\nit up and over any hill that ’buses climb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. A “FISCHER” COMBINATION OMNIBUS\r\n\r\nCapacity fifteen passengers; weight, 2 tons 13 cwt.; speed, 12 miles an\r\nhour\r\n\r\n_By permission of the Fischer Motor Vehicle Syndicate, Ltd., London_]\r\n\r\nThe manager of the Road Car Company is of opinion that the new vehicles\r\nwill carry from twelve to twenty passengers. Owing to the greater speed\r\nof the motors, however, the passenger accommodation provided by, say,\r\nhalf a dozen such cars would be greater than that of a similar number of\r\nomnibuses, for the service would be more frequent. Not much increase of\r\nspeed can be hoped for in congested areas, but outside these the motor\r\nshould be able to run half as fast again as the horsed ’bus.\r\n\r\nThere exists, however, no reason why a still more improved and refined\r\nomnibus service should not be started, electricity alone being adopted,\r\ninstead of steam, petrol, or a combination. Runs of seventy and eighty\r\nmiles without recharging are perfectly feasible by using standard\r\nlong-distance batteries, and would suffice for the daily journeys of the\r\nomnibus, while the recharging could be effected with little or no\r\ntrouble after working-hours.\r\n\r\nMotor-omnibuses, besides working on the regular routes, can be run on\r\nthe tramway time-table system on tramway sections where there is little\r\ntraffic; while for developing scantily-populated districts and\r\naccustoming people to travel, automobile public conveyances are perfect\r\nagencies, the very fact that they can choose their own route\r\naccentuating this great advantage; and on special occasions, for\r\ninstance when exhibitions are held in places inaccessible by tramways,\r\nthey will be a source of considerable profit.\r\n\r\nOur provincial towns (take Eastbourne and Hastings for example) are\r\nbeginning to wake up on the subject, and many of them have adopted or\r\ncontemplated the starting of some form of horseless omnibus, in several\r\ncases the motive power being electricity. Across the Atlantic automobile\r\n’buses are run by the Fifth Avenue Stage Company of New York City down\r\nFifth Avenue, and have proved most popular; while in Chicago there are\r\nthree lines of electric omnibuses successfully competing with the street\r\ncars for patronage. They are double-decked, seating forty passengers,\r\nand when they are “full-up” express speed is put on, and there are no\r\nmore stoppages until the down-town district is reached.\r\n\r\nAs to four-wheeled cabs, they are hopelessly behind the times, though\r\nexcellent ones may be evolved out of the landaulette type of\r\nelectromobiles. During sixty-two years of sullen toleration on the part\r\nof the public, the growler has improved but little, and it remains a\r\nmystery why in the streets of the world’s metropolis comfortable and\r\ncomely private vehicles cannot be hailed for hire, as in other cities.\r\n\r\nNew and improved cabs, such as the “Brougham,” the “Clarence,” and the\r\n“Chesterfield,” from time to time appear in our streets, and inspire\r\nhope that a general reformation is about to take place, and that neat\r\nlittle coupés will be universal. But in some unaccountable manner, after\r\na brief season they disappear from public view--as did the\r\nlemon-coloured electric broughams of a few years ago--relegated to some\r\nmysterious region where vehicular failures find employment when banished\r\nfrom Modern Babylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_HORSELESS VEHICLES, ELECTRICAL AND OTHERWISE (continued)_\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTOR-CARS IN WARFARE\r\n\r\nThe question of mechanical traction in war is of the gravest importance,\r\nthe increasing size of armies and the large area they cover when in\r\naction, necessitating the employment of some form of haulage other than\r\nthat of railways or horses.\r\n\r\nFor bringing up guns and their ammunition at a critical moment\r\nautomobiles are of the greatest value. At the Motor-car Reliability\r\nTrials last autumn there was present a military officer of considerable\r\nexperience who was much impressed with the possibilities of the motor in\r\nbattle. If, he argued, sixty cars could run down from London to the\r\nSouth Coast easily in three hours carrying an average of four passengers\r\neach, the same number of horseless vehicles could convey sixty\r\nmachine-guns to Brighton in a similar time. A corps of these might, he\r\nsaid, have proved extremely handy in the late South African campaign. To\r\nillustrate this, he pointed out that quick-firing guns carried on\r\nautomobiles might possibly have ended the Boer War after the action of\r\nPoplar Grove. He was present on that occasion, and could speak with\r\nauthority. All the enemy had been routed out of their far-reaching\r\ntrenches and were in full flight. Then was the time to push home the\r\nattack, but cavalry and infantry were thoroughly done up by the great\r\nflanking movement and were unable to follow up their advantage. In full\r\nsight of our army, the Boers scuttled away along the plain with only a\r\nfew desultory shells fired after them. “Now,” said the officer, “if we\r\nhad only possessed a few automobiles with guns on that occasion we\r\nshould have scored very heavily. The veldt was level enough for the\r\npurpose. A big victory at that critical moment might have thoroughly\r\ndemoralised the Boers, already much disheartened by Cronje’s defeat a\r\nshort time before at Paardeberg, and so caused them to surrender without\r\nmuch ado.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt the gallant soldier took rather a sanguine view of the\r\nsituation; but of one thing he might have been certain, viz., that at\r\nthat time neither an unenterprising War Office, nor a Colonial\r\nDepartment capable of requisitioning ordinary infantry from Australia to\r\nact against the wily mounted Boer, would for one moment have thought of\r\nsending motor-cars out for the purpose he suggests!\r\n\r\nNot only for light artillery, but for heavy guns, motors can now be used\r\nin warfare, and Lord Roberts had a road-train constructed for South\r\nAfrica sufficiently armoured to withstand rifle-fire, and powerful\r\nenough to draw a couple of heavy guns with their crews and ammunition,\r\nthe motive power being steam.\r\n\r\nIn the prosaic work of conveying stores, motor-tractors with lorries\r\nare fast becoming integral parts of our complicated war-system, and the\r\nreport of the trials held at Aldershot in December, 1901, is decidedly\r\nin favour of their employment on a large scale. The tests were severe,\r\nand included two days’ running (with full loads) of thirty miles a day,\r\nand a march of 197 miles (also with full loads) in six consecutive, days\r\non roads both hard and soft, and even over boggy ground, the gradients\r\nbeing various, and in places very stiff. The first prize was awarded to\r\nthe Thorneycroft Steam Waggon Company, but although the committee\r\nbelieved that these steam lorries were serviceable and useful for the\r\npresent, they were much struck with the great possibilities of machines\r\nburning heavy oil. Their observations were as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Compared with horse-draught, these trials have shown that\r\nself-propelled lorries can transport five tons of stores at about six\r\nmiles an hour over very considerable distances on hilly, average English\r\nroads under winter conditions. The load transported by each single lorry\r\n(five tons) if carried in horse-waggons of service pattern would\r\noverload three G.S. waggons, requiring twelve draught horses, besides\r\nriding horses, whose pace would not ordinarily exceed three miles an\r\nhour. Moreover, the marching of 197 miles in six consecutive days would\r\nnot have been accomplished by horses even at that speed without the\r\nassistance of spare horses.”\r\n\r\nTo this report appeared the following appendix of considerable\r\nimportance:--\r\n\r\n“The committee, in carrying out the tests, travelled in motor-cars, and\r\nas a result of their experience they remark, ‘The committee desire to\r\nbring to special notice the incidental demonstration afforded by these\r\ntrials of the great possibilities for staff work, and for work in\r\nconnection with the command of long transport trains, of the motor-car.\r\nNo vehicles drawn by horses could have possibly covered the distances or\r\nkept up the speeds required; portions of the roads, sometimes miles in\r\nlength, had to be traversed and retraversed several times, and at speeds\r\nbeyond the capabilities of horse-flesh. Riding horses would have been\r\nknocked up to an extent necessitating large relays. The staff officer,\r\nmoreover, instead of being fatigued, is always comparatively fresh at\r\nthe end of the day.’”\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the Army, from the Commander-in-Chief downwards, is\r\nquickly becoming devoted to motoring. The quantity of work that can be\r\ngot through by means of the automobile is a revelation to those who have\r\nbeen used to travelling by means of horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. THE “HERCULES” TRACTION ENGINE, AS USED DURING\r\nTHE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\n_By permission of_ _Sampson Low, Marston, & Co., London_]\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War, Boydell’s traction machine was used to haul open\r\ntrucks on the road and across country. Its engine, the “Hercules,” was\r\nfitted with a curious arrangement, which, by means of rails attached in\r\nsix sections to the wheels, enabled it to lay down and take up its own\r\ntrack as it went along.\r\n\r\nIn the South African campaign the military traction engines did some\r\nexcellent work, and, as they rolled over the plains, startled the\r\nKaffirs out of their senses at the unwonted sight of what they probably\r\nthought was some new and monstrous form of rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nIt has yet to be decided what is the best motive power for lorry cars in\r\nwarfare, both oil and steam motors having, as compared with those driven\r\nby electricity, the disadvantage that the machinery moves by a series of\r\nshocks. Doubtless the ideal power would be one that acted evenly. The\r\nelectric motor is superior to all others in the regularity of its\r\naction, and its steering is most readily effected. All that is wanted to\r\nadapt electric traction to military purposes is a perfected storage\r\nbattery, and the day may not be far distant when extensive use will be\r\nmade of light accumulators capable of being safely carried and of being\r\nrecharged as readily as a steam engine can be supplied with fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTORS IN AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nIn England the use of steam for agricultural machinery has hitherto been\r\nconfined to the purpose of ploughing and threshing. But coal in some\r\ndistricts is dear, and farmers are beginning to find that oil engines\r\nare more economical, there being no loss of fuel in the sudden stopping\r\nof work during wet weather; but petrol has a nasty trick of not\r\nvaporising readily when it is frosty, and here electricity steps in with\r\nan admirable _force-motif_.\r\n\r\nWith a dependable electro-motor, the farmer may work his self-binder all\r\nday long in the harvest-field, and at-night send it up to market with\r\nproduce. Moreover, the motor may help to plough and harrow in the\r\nwinter, and when there is no work to be done it costs nothing,\r\nhaving--unlike the horse--no stomach to fill.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the successful adaptation of the motor to farming may solve the\r\never-present labour problem, and do much to resuscitate the agricultural\r\nindustry, while fruit and vegetable growers may find it invaluable,\r\nmaking them independent of high railway rates and bad train service.\r\nBut, although the application of the automobile to agriculture is only\r\nin the experimental stage, it cannot be doubted that, in some shape or\r\nother, it will come to the cornfield, the orchard, and the market\r\ngarden, while the modern farmer will welcome it gladly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. A TEN-TON ELECTRIC TROLLEY\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Anglo-American Motor Car Co., Ltd., London_]\r\n\r\nProbably it will begin, as was suggested by Mr. Rider Haggard before the\r\nNorfolk Chamber of Agriculture at Norwich, in the shape of an\r\nagricultural post. His plan was to enlarge the present system of\r\nparcel-post so that one hundred packages, each of 100 lbs. in weight,\r\nshould be carried in the same way as parcels of only 10 lbs., and that\r\nproduce of any sort, such as a crate of apples, the carcase of a sheep,\r\na basket of flowers, etc., should be delivered the next morning to\r\nwhatever part of England the goods were consigned.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCANTILE MOTORS\r\n\r\nThe prosaic use of motors is increasing rapidly. In our streets are\r\nfrequently seen steam or petrol lorries for the heavy goods of brewers,\r\nstone-merchants, builders, contractors, engineers, asphalt-paving\r\ncompanies, etc.; substantial vans for wholesale manufacturing houses and\r\ngreat establishments, such as Bryant and May’s, Maple’s, Harrod’s,\r\nWhiteley’s, and Barker’s; lighter vehicles for smaller tradesmen, carts\r\nfor county council and borough council work; a few fire-engines and\r\nambulance waggons; while in the country any number of motors are used by\r\nshopkeepers to deliver their goods for miles around.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. AN ELECTRIC TRADESMAN’S-VAN\r\n\r\n_By permission of the Automobile Co. of Great Britain, London_]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the mercantile use of motors has grown so much, that before\r\nlong we may even see “Black Maria” delivering and picking up its daily\r\nquantum of _détenus_ through the medium of stored-up electricity.\r\n\r\nWe must just glance at the subject of motor-bicycles, driven by petrol\r\nand “sparked” by electricity. They are beginning to be much used for\r\ngetting about quickly, for trailers, and as sporting machines for\r\n“breaking the record.” In September last year, at the Crystal Palace,\r\nsome extraordinary results were obtained by them in the matter of speed,\r\none of them covering no less than fifty miles in an hour and eight\r\nminutes!\r\n\r\nSir Martin Conway’s opinion, humorously delivered this year to the\r\nSociety of Arts, respecting “stupid cyclists” and motor-cycles, is worth\r\nrecording. He said that the first thing on which he desired knowledge\r\nconcerning motor-cycles was how he was to fall off, as he fell off every\r\nmachine on wheels some time or other; next, how long it would take a man\r\nto understand the parts in a motor-cycle, or whether they were\r\nhopelessly removed from the range of the ordinary stupid person; then,\r\nhow the thing vibrated; and, finally, which of them did not break down.\r\nHe said that he had been told that the pleasure with a motor-car was\r\nconsiderable when it went, and the annoyance even more considerable when\r\nit did not go.\r\n\r\nMotors are everywhere, and are used for every purpose. There are motors\r\nin the Equatorial Free States of the Congo, where there is no energetic\r\npoliceman, stop-watch in hand, to time the “driver” and summon him; and\r\none day--who knows?--there may be motor-cars in use at the North Pole.\r\n\r\nThe motor has even been the indirect cause of political upheavings, for\r\nit is said that the revolution in Morocco came to a head because the\r\nfanatical tribal allies of the Pretender resisted, amongst other\r\nEuropean articles, the introduction of automobiles into the country, and\r\nopposed their use by the enlightened emperor, as too progressive, and\r\nnot in accordance with the Mussulman faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. ANOTHER TYPE OF THE “FISCHER” COMBINATION\r\nOMNIBUS\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Fischer Motor Vehicle Syndicate, London_]\r\n\r\nMeals are sent out in motor-vans by the London Distributing Kitchen\r\nCompany from its well-equipped premises near the Army and Navy Stores,\r\nthe breakfasts, luncheons, and dinners being placed in air-tight baskets\r\nin aluminium receptacles. In Manchester, for some time past, “meals by\r\nmotor” have been an accomplished fact, and most popular and lucrative\r\nthe scheme has proved.\r\n\r\nMotoring has its romantic side. For instance, in France--the birthplace\r\nof the automobile--abduction by motor has been initiated, and our lively\r\nneighbours may possibly contemplate the revival of that mediæval custom\r\nof wedlock by force. This young lady, however, seems to have been a not\r\nunwilling party to the transaction.\r\n\r\nGoing to school by motor has also been made practicable across the\r\nChannel. For some months the Ecole Lacordaire, in Paris, has been\r\nrunning a Serpollet steam omnibus, which collects the pupils and conveys\r\nthem to and from the school. The day’s run gives a total of sixty miles.\r\nMonsieur Serpollet has lately carried out an interesting test with the\r\nvehicle. He made a run of sixty miles with twelve passengers, and the\r\ncost for petrol was 1_s._ 2_d._ per passenger, or rather more than four\r\nmiles for a penny. The omnibus averaged eighteen miles an hour.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_HORSELESS VEHICLES, ELECTRICAL AND OTHERWISE_ (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEED OF MOTOR-CARS\r\n\r\nTo motorists the pressing question of the day is _speed_. In England the\r\nmotor-car was in its infancy when the present law came into force.\r\nBefore its birth, no mechanically propelled carriage could travel along\r\nthe highway faster than four miles an hour; but six years ago a\r\ndetermined attempt was made to adapt the law to the exigencies of modern\r\ntraffic. Fourteen miles an hour was decided upon as the maximum speed,\r\nand the Local Government Board subsequently reduced the limit to twelve\r\nmiles. But these regulations are now out of date.\r\n\r\nA few years ago there was a great outcry against cycle speeds. That has\r\ndied out, not because cyclists ride more slowly, but because the public\r\nhas come to realise that, with a readily controllable vehicle like the\r\nbicycle, the greater speeds are not dangerous. Similarly the public is\r\nnow much exercised in mind concerning speeds of twenty to twenty-five\r\nmiles an hour by motor-cars. It will not be long before they realise\r\nthat these velocities are quite safe under certain conditions, and that\r\nthe motor-car might almost under any circumstances be allowed to travel\r\ntwice as fast as a horse, indeed even faster. It is said that this year\r\nthe speed of the motor-car is expected to approach a hundred miles an\r\nhour. The Hon. C. S. Rolls came very near to attaining it at Welbeck\r\nlast February, when he made an attempt on the flying kilometre record.\r\nThe best of four runs gave the time of 27 seconds, which is a speed of\r\n82⅘ miles per hour, and 1⅕ seconds better than Mr. Jarrott’s run over\r\nthis course last year. Whether it will rank as a world’s record is not\r\ncertain, as the road in the Duke of Portland’s park has a slight\r\nfavouring gradient. The French official record on the Dourdan road is\r\ntwenty-nine seconds, a speed of seventy-seven miles per hour,\r\naccomplished by both Fournier and Augières. Mr. Rolls drove an 80\r\nhorse-power Mors, which he entered for the Paris-Madrid race.\r\n\r\nEstimates of speed differ in the most extraordinary degree, and the Hon.\r\nJ. Scott-Montagu gave to the _Car_ the following humorous table, the\r\nresult of an inquiry at a police court:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Miles.\r\n  “Private opinion of mechanic in charge            12\r\n   His opinion when talking to his friends          20\r\n   His opinion when in court                         8\r\n   Policeman’s private opinion                      14\r\n   Policeman’s opinion in court                     28\r\n   Farmer’s opinion when a pony was frightened      50\r\n   Maker’s guaranteed speed                         16\r\n   Actual speed                                     10”\r\n\r\nMotorists are evidently assumed to be made of money, if we may judge by\r\nthe following statement made by a correspondent of _Motoring\r\nIllustrated_ this year. He says, “One curious result of a car case, in\r\nwhich I was fined £10 for ‘scorching,’ is that in less than a week I\r\nhave received upwards of seventy begging letters from charitable\r\nsocieties or individual beggars. Motor owner and millionaire are\r\napparently one and the same thing in the popular mind.”\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold de Rothschild, who is entitled to speak with authority on\r\nthe subject, frankly admits that there is much justification for the\r\nirritation in the public mind against motor-cars. He strongly condemns\r\nrash driving, but, at the same time, maintains that when motor-car\r\nowners obey the law and observe the courtesy of the road, they ought not\r\nto be looked upon by coachmen, cyclists, and pedestrians, as the enemies\r\nof mankind.[9] Nevertheless, he firmly believes that the dislike of\r\nmotor-cars will die away in due time, just as did the dislike of cycles.\r\nThe utmost caution ought, he concedes, to be exercised by drivers in the\r\ncrowded thoroughfares of large towns.\r\n\r\nOn the question of their importance generally in relation to British\r\nindustry Mr. Leopold de Rothschild says, “We should foster them by every\r\nmeans in our power. At the beginning not a single one was produced in\r\nthis country, but at the present moment some of the machines turned out\r\nin English workshops rival those of the very best French make. In recent\r\ncontests on the Continent, too, English cars have more than held their\r\nown. It is sometimes complained that the machines make a great noise.\r\nThat defect is being gradually cured. Then it is urged that they raise a\r\ntremendous dust as they speed along. That evil is also being remedied,\r\nand will disappear altogether if the experiment of pouring petroleum on\r\nthe roadways should prove successful. Where the motor-car is extremely\r\nuseful, I consider, is in enabling people to go across country to attend\r\nhunt meets and visit distant golf links. Then, again, see what\r\nencouragement is given to wayside inns. When in Scotland the other day I\r\nvisited a friend who lived twenty-five miles off, and did it comfortably\r\nbetween luncheon and dinner, and that, too, without endangering the life\r\nof myself or anybody else. I regard the motor-car as a source of intense\r\nenjoyment. Allow the owners greater freedom, but take care that in\r\nreturn they loyally observe the regulations which are framed by\r\ncompetent authorities for the safety of the public.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTOR-CARS AND PUBLIC HIGHWAYS\r\n\r\nWho can place a limit to the development of motors! The time may arrive\r\nwhen tram lines will disappear, the roads themselves being of steel and\r\nforming a broad rail upon which self-propelled coaches, omnibuses, cabs,\r\nand cars will ply in every direction, and far and wide into the suburbs.\r\nThis is the idea of Mr. A. A. C. Swinton, who also thinks that\r\neventually motor-cars will drive tram-cars out, because, as he says,\r\n“Tramways are merely a smooth place on a rough road, with a groove to\r\nkeep the wheel in a smooth place,” and as one day the whole road will be\r\nsmooth the tram-rails will disappear.\r\n\r\nSomething similar, I take it, was in Mr. Balfour’s mind when, in 1901,\r\nwriting to the Warden of the Browning Settlement in Camberwell on the\r\nsubject of homes for the workers, he said:--\r\n\r\n“What I am anxious people should bear in mind is that trams, railways,\r\nand ‘tubes’ by no means exhaust the catalogue of possible improvements\r\nin transit; indeed, I am not sure that they are the means of\r\ncommunication for relatively short distances which some years hence will\r\nfind most favour. What I should like to see carefully thought out by\r\ncompetent authorities would be a system of radiating thoroughfares,\r\nconfined to rapid (say, fifteen miles an hour or over) traffic (that is\r\nabsolutely essential), and with a surface designed, not for carts or\r\nhorses, but for some form of auto-car propulsion. If the local authority\r\nwhich designed and carried out such a system chose to run public\r\nauto-cars along them, well and good. But this would not be necessary,\r\nand private enterprise would probably in time do all that was wanted. In\r\nsuch a thoroughfare there would be none of the monopoly inseparable from\r\ntrams, the number of people carried could be much larger, the speed much\r\ngreater, the power of taking them from door to door unique, while there\r\nwould be none of the friction now caused when the owners of the tram\r\nlines break up the public streets. It may be urged--and, perhaps, with\r\ntruth--that at present the auto-car industry has not devised an\r\nabsolutely satisfactory vehicle; but we are, I believe, so near it that\r\nthe delay ought not to be material.”\r\n\r\n“It is, of course, obvious,” he continued, “that the present difficulty\r\nof locomotion in our streets is almost entirely due to want of\r\ndifferentiation in the traffic. We act as the owners of a railway would\r\nact if they allowed luggage trains, express trains, and horse-drawn\r\ntrams to run upon one pair of rails. The radiating causeways, as I\r\nconceive them, would be entirely free from this difficulty. Neither the\r\ntraffic of cross streets, nor foot passengers, nor slow-going carts and\r\nvehicles would be permitted to interfere with the equable running of\r\nfast cars. There would be no danger and no block; and as the causeway\r\nwould be connected at intervals with the ordinary road and street system\r\nof the district, and would melt into that system at either end, every\r\nvillage in which there were enough residents who had to be in London at\r\na fixed hour every day could have a motor of its own. It might be well\r\nworth a manufacturer’s while, I should suppose, to lodge his workpeople\r\nout of London, and to run them to and from his works.”\r\n\r\nNo electrician living can predict with certainty what the motor-car may\r\n_not_ result in.\r\n\r\nOne thing only is probable--that our metropolitan streets will soon be\r\ncongested with vehicles to such an extent as to leave no space for\r\nhorses. And then will come the complete victory of the automobile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_ELECTRICITY APPLIED TO NAVIGATION (A FORECAST)_\r\n\r\n    “And knowledge shall be increased.”--DANIEL xii. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT IN SIZE OF SHIPS AND STEAMERS\r\n\r\n“Don’t give yourself away,” shrewdly remarked an eminent engineer, as I\r\ndiscussed with him the outline of this work, and the probability that in\r\nthe near future, gigantic ships, as long as the Crystal Palace, and\r\npropelled solely by electricity, would traverse the seas. “I have not\r\nyet come across any form of accumulator that could be adapted to such a\r\npurpose, though I admit that the next quarter of a century may produce\r\nsome startling results. Still, I would not, if I were you, write about\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMy friend, like many scientists, was cautious, and did not like to\r\ncommit himself; but I am not professionally restricted, and may freely\r\nindulge in a dream containing many elements of reality, and “take the\r\nwings of fancy,” nay, may also “take the wings of foresight,” and try to\r\ndescribe a mail-packet of the future.\r\n\r\nBut before entering into particulars of that phenomenon, the _Princess\r\nIda_, and to prepare ourselves for the contemplation of her large\r\nproportions, we should note the evolutionary process which has gone on\r\nsteadily for the last seventy years, and rapidly during the close of\r\nthe Victorian Era, in regard to the size and tonnage of ocean steamers.\r\n\r\nTo go far back for the purpose of comparison--_i.e._ to the days when\r\nBritain as a maritime nation was in her infancy, or even to Tudor and\r\nStuart times, when the _Great Harry_ floated proudly in English waters,\r\nand Elizabeth’s _Ark Royal_ defied the Spanish Armada, or when Phineas\r\nPett reconstructed Charles the Second’s navy and planned those famous\r\nmen-of-war, the _Royal Sovereign_, _Royal Charles_, and _Royal\r\nPrince_--is misleading, because up to Nelson’s time the practice of\r\nbuilding ships with an extravagant amount of “sheer” (the forecastle\r\nand stern towering upwards to protect the fighting men, and producing\r\nthe outline of a doubled-up old shoe), together with the pronounced\r\n“tumbling in” of the ship’s sides, rendered it difficult to arrive at\r\nany correct estimate of length and beam. Approximately, 1,500 tons might\r\nrepresent the _Great Harry’s_ measurement, and 150 feet her length, the\r\nCarolean _Royal_ being about the same.\r\n\r\nThis method of shipbuilding began to be modified while Pepys was at the\r\nAdmiralty, but it was very gradually abandoned, and had almost\r\ndisappeared at the beginning of the century, the _Victory_, slightly\r\nover 2,000 tons, and some 152 feet in length, showing but a slight trace\r\nof it in her high poop.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 a merchantman of 1,000 tons was considered a big craft, the\r\nlargest on Lloyd’s register for that year being 1,500 tons, upon which\r\nthere was not much advance until the “fifties” and “sixties,” when all\r\nthe adventurous of England’s manhood were irresistibly attracted to the\r\ngoldfields of Australia, and vessels of large tonnage began to be laid\r\ndown on the stocks. Of such were the _British Empire_, 2,676 tons; the\r\n_Donald McKay_, 2,636 tons; _Red Jacket_, 2,000 tons; and many others\r\nof from 1,000 to 1,800 tons registered tonnage. These in their turn gave\r\nplace to iron “sailers” of immense capacity, the tendency being to build\r\nthem bigger and still bigger--“five-masters” of from 3,000 to 4,000\r\ntons--it having been found that they are worked more economically than\r\nsmaller craft, and are able to compete with the larger vessels of other\r\ncountries, and with the syndicates that threaten to monopolise the\r\nnation’s carrying trade. Foreign examples are _La France_, 3,624 tons,\r\nand the _Preussen_ (biggest in the world), 4,700 tons.\r\n\r\nIn steamers the development of size has been great, and astonishingly so\r\nsince the universal adoption of the screw-propeller. For instance, the\r\npaddle-wheel _William Fawcett_, that pioneered the P. and O. Company,\r\nbuilt in 1829, was but 74 feet long; the Cunard _Britannia_, that took\r\nCharles Dickens to Boston, was a paddle-boat of 1,154 tons, and 207 feet\r\nlong; the _Great Britain_ (1843) was 3,400 tons register, and regarded\r\nas phenomenal.\r\n\r\nPresently the shipping world arrived at the awakening period of its\r\nhistory, when steamers of from 350 to 500 feet long, and of from 4,000\r\nto 7,000 tons, began to be common; but old stagers shook their heads,\r\nand asked where and when this enlargement was going to stop. Time went\r\non, and splendid mail boats, such as the Cunard _Scotia_ and _Persia_,\r\nin their day considered perfect, were looked upon as obsolete, and even\r\ntheir successors, the _Servia_, 7,392 tons and 515 feet long, the\r\n_Etruria_, 7,718 tons and 502 feet long, and others of similar\r\ndimensions, soon ceased to be wondered at. This was eighteen years ago.\r\nThen, by leaps and bounds, so great was the competition between the\r\ndifferent Atlantic liners, and so strong the demand for speed, that\r\n10,000 tons was soon reached in the White Star Company’s _Majestic_ and\r\n_Teutonic_, and exceeded by the Cunarders, _Campania_ and _Lucania_\r\n(1893), of 13,000 tons each, 620 feet in length, and over 65 feet in\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nBut Harland and Wolff, of Belfast, who had been building 12,000 ton\r\nboats, metaphorically without “turning a hair,” were determined not to\r\nbe beaten, and produced their new _Oceanic_ (1899), 704 feet by 68 feet,\r\n_i.e._ nearly as long as the Haymarket, and about as broad as one\r\nportion of Piccadilly. In her, it was thought, finality had been\r\nreached; but last year Belfast witnessed the launch of a still bigger\r\nvessel, the _Cedric_, 21,000 tons gross register, 700 feet long, and 75\r\nfeet wide--the largest steamer afloat! Even she is destined to take\r\nsecond place, as ere long two ships belonging to the Cunard Line will\r\ndispossess the _Cedric_ of her premier position. These wonderful\r\ncreations will be 750 feet by 76 feet, with an estimated sea-speed of 25\r\nknots.\r\n\r\nThus we clearly see how enormously the dimensions of steamers have\r\nincreased; for instance, the _Britannia_ (1840) was 1,154 tons, and 207\r\nfeet long, and had accommodation for 115 cabin passengers, no “steerage”\r\nbeing carried. But the _Cedric_ is nearly 3½ times longer, and carries\r\n3,000 people across the Atlantic, besides her crew of 350 hands. In the\r\nsame ratio of progression, ships (they will not be called _steamers_,\r\nbut _electrofers_) 2,500 feet long, with comfortable quarters for 75,000\r\nhuman beings, will be the order of the day!\r\n\r\nI have not referred to the poor old _Great Eastern_--or _Leviathan_ as\r\nshe was originally named--680 feet long, and of 16,000 tons register.\r\nShe was before her time, and, like other big steamers of that day, far\r\ntoo heavy in her plating to be driven economically at even moderate\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nGreat dimensions and swiftness have been rendered possible by improved\r\nengines, but chiefly by the employment of steel in their construction,\r\nwhich so materially reduces the _vis inertia_, that in the case of the\r\n_Pennsylvania_, built by Harland and Wolff for the Hamburg-American\r\nLine, although a mighty carrack of something like 585 feet, and 62 feet\r\nby 42 feet, her actual dead-weight is only 8,000 tons. Still more\r\nremarkable will be the reduction--about one-half--when aluminium with\r\nsome form of alloy--copper, perhaps--comes into general use.\r\nTorpedo-boats have been built with this metal, and have run with great\r\nsmoothness. It exists in every clay and shale formation, and is\r\nscattered throughout the world in immense profusion, our London clay\r\nconsisting principally of silicate of alumina. Electricity is used in\r\nmanufacturing this beautiful metal, that requires no paint to defend it\r\nfrom rusting; and, although it has hitherto been a costly article, the\r\ntime is not far off--so it is said--when the price will come down to £19\r\na ton, or less.\r\n\r\nA recent and novel application of aluminium to building purposes is to\r\nbe seen at Chicago, where a house sixteen stories high is fronted on\r\nboth sides with it, instead of bricks or terra-cotta.\r\n\r\nBerthing the monstrous ships of the future is a problem met by a radical\r\nand world-wide alteration in the dimensions of docks, supplemented by\r\nquays running out into deep water, which in London would extend on both\r\nsides of the Thames, on the north from Tilbury to the Albert Docks, thus\r\nconverting the old river, like the Clyde, into a long water-street lined\r\nby sea-walls, and kept constantly dredged, and connected with London by\r\nspecial lines of railway.\r\n\r\nBut what is to be the propelling power of the future leviathans? Not\r\nsteam; but electricity, applied to the machinery from storage batteries.\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC STORAGE AS A MOTIVE POWER\r\n\r\nSceptics in the past argued that it was manifestly impossible that\r\nvehicles would ever be horseless, or that communications would one day\r\nbe transmitted by telegraph, not to speak of the time when even the\r\nwires for that purpose would be dispensed with; while the suggestion\r\nthat artificial light would be obtained through any other agency than\r\ncandles or oil-lamps, and that sail-less ships would be propelled\r\nagainst wind and tide, seemed savouring of Bedlam!\r\n\r\nYet all these seeming impossibilities, and many more, have become\r\nrealities. So, too, will electrical marine propulsion, and, although we\r\nlive in a more enlightened era than our ancestors, few persons even now\r\nperhaps realise that ships will be navigated without either sail or\r\nsteam power.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the public have become so familiarised with\r\nscientific marvels, that they have ceased to wonder at anything. For\r\ninstance, there is nothing really more marvellous than that hundreds, or\r\neven thousands, of horse-power should be borne by a copper wire, or a\r\nmoderate cable, and despatched to a distant point with the speed of\r\nlightning for traction purposes; but, without knowing what the nature of\r\nthe force is, we cease to be astonished at it. In point of fact, it is\r\nnot more occult than heat or light, the attraction of gravity or\r\ncohesion.\r\n\r\nTherefore when it was announced last year that Edison had solved the\r\nproblem of how to store electrical force effectually, everybody took it\r\nfor granted that he had been, or would eventually be, as successful in\r\nthis direction as in multiplying electric light and applying it to a\r\nthousand new purposes.\r\n\r\nThe “Wizard of Llewellyn Park” is necessarily a sanguine inventor, but\r\nhe has taken the right and only satisfactory way to determine the\r\nquestion--that of varied and long-continued experiment. Electricity\r\ndiffers from all other forms of power in two respects--it can be stored,\r\nand transmitted to a distance. The task of transmission has been, and is\r\nbeing, rapidly achieved. The far greater object of light and efficient\r\nstorage, the most momentous problem awaiting solution in the whole range\r\nof practical physics, may very shortly be solved.\r\n\r\nIn brief, Edison’s storage battery cells are composed of tiny bricks of\r\nspecially-prepared iron and nickel. In charging and discharging, oxygen\r\nis driven from one metal to the other and back again through the action\r\nof a potash solution, and without corrosion or waste. Renewal of the\r\nwater supply is all that is needed to keep the cells in good condition,\r\nand a process of recharging has been improved, so that less time is\r\nconsumed than for the recharging of other batteries. No wonder he\r\nbelieves that the application of storage batteries will ultimately be\r\nextended to trains, and especially to ships.\r\n\r\nThe claim of the Edison Accumulator is that it will occupy about the\r\nsame space as the present battery, and that it will weigh only about\r\nseventy per cent. as much, and will be more durable. Men conversant with\r\nthe theory of electrical science are not so thoroughly impressed with\r\nthe work accomplished as is Mr. Edison. The tests that have been made\r\nhave been more than duplicated, it is said, by the batteries now on the\r\nmarket. We may assume, then, that either Edison’s or somebody else’s\r\nmethod of storing up electricity for the propulsion of sea-going vessels\r\nwill be perfected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. ELECTRIC STORAGE BATTERIES\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Electric Power Storage Co., Ltd., London_]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “PRINCESS IDA” IN THE YEAR A.D. 19--\r\n\r\nEarly one morning in the spring of 19--a small party of ladies and\r\ngentlemen, anxious to avoid the east wind fiend by flying from their\r\nnative shores to milder regions, travelled by the electric railway\r\ntowards the mouth of the Thames, and, branching off at a point near\r\nBarking Junction, traversed the new line, running for miles alongside\r\nthe splendid quays recently completed between Galleon’s Reach and\r\nTilbury, where special berths were reserved for the leviathan liners\r\nthat had begun running from the port of London to Cape Town.\r\n\r\nLong before the station was reached inquiring glances had been cast\r\nriverwards for the first glimpse of the giantess _Princess Ida_.\r\n\r\n“That cannot be the _Princess Ida_,” said an unbelieving and\r\nshort-sighted member of the party to his sharp-eyed friend, who was\r\npointing to something which in the distance looked like a couple of\r\nWhite Star _Cedrics_ linked together and towering above the roofs of the\r\nwarehouses that commanded the quays.\r\n\r\n“Well, you will see for yourself presently,” he retorted. “Seeing is\r\nbelieving, isn’t it?” And as the train got nearer and nearer, wonder and\r\nadmiration increased, and when a break in the line of warehouses gave\r\nthem a clear view of the great vessel, her beautiful proportions, her\r\npolished hull gleaming in the sunlight, and her exquisite cleanliness,\r\ntheir excitement and enthusiasm rendered them speechless.\r\n\r\nThe _Princess_ was berthed close alongside the river wall, and through a\r\ngreat sliding port in her side over a short, stout gangway like a\r\ndrawbridge, neat motor-cars laden with luggage, and with passengers who\r\nhad made the run direct from their London homes, passed in continually,\r\nemerging later from a corresponding port-hole some distance away. Of\r\ncargo there was none, the only resemblance to it being mails, sufficient\r\nin quantity, however, to fully load an ordinary small steamer. As these\r\nwere not timed to arrive alongside from the General Post Office until\r\ntwo o’clock, the party had plenty of leisure to look around, and from\r\nwhat they had read about this wonderful ship, supplemented by much\r\ninformation supplied by a courteous and communicative official detailed\r\nas cicerone, they were able to give the following history and\r\nparticulars of that interesting up-to-date creation of shipbuilding--the\r\nfair giantess _Princess Ida_.\r\n\r\nShe was constructed by the Thames Ironworks Company, a flourishing\r\nconcern that worthily represented the marked revival of the shipbuilding\r\nindustry in the world’s metropolis. The material used throughout, except\r\nfor the lower masts, machinery, propellers, and rigging, was aluminium\r\nalloyed with copper. Her dimensions were as follows: length over all,\r\n1,600 feet; breadth amidships, 164 feet; depth from upper deck, 110\r\nfeet; estimated gross registered tonnage, 33,500; but her lines were so\r\nperfect and graceful as to mask these enormous measurements.[10] She had\r\nan “entrance” forward like a clipper ship, and a “clearance” aft of the\r\nutmost fineness, the stem being rounded off in most beautiful curves.\r\nHer floor in the midship sections was flat, and resembled the letter U,\r\nand deep bilge keels helped to keep her steady, and enabled her to\r\nsettle down upon her shore cradle without risk of canting or straining.\r\nHer horizontal outline revealed to nautical eyes just that amount of\r\n“sheer,” and no more, necessary for strength, rising almost\r\nimperceptibly to a graceful overhanging bow, from which pointed a\r\ntapering bowsprit, apparently short, but in reality a single massive\r\nspar of Oregon pine.\r\n\r\nThis style had been adopted by the owners because, as they argued, it\r\nadded considerably to the beauty of the great ship, and as she probably\r\nwould never enter a dock--using a shore cradle when it was necessary to\r\ncleanse the hull--a few score feet added to her length would make but\r\nlittle difference in the room she took up at the quays. The figure-head,\r\nof oxidised silver, was a beautiful half-draped representation of\r\nTennyson’s fair Princess--\r\n\r\n    “All beauty compass’d in a female form.”\r\n\r\nFive magnificent pole-masts, set up with thick wire shrouds and\r\nbackstays, rose aloft from her deck, their lower part of steel, the\r\nupper section of polished and varnished American fir, terminating in\r\ngilded globes, one of them being specially set apart for the wireless\r\ntelegraph apparatus. These masts, with a graceful “rake,” could not have\r\nbeen much less than three hundred feet high, but were in accurate\r\nproportion to the length of the _Princess Ida_, giving her the\r\nappearance of a Brobdingnagian five-masted fore-and-aft schooner. In an\r\nemergency, sails could be put up from them to keep the ship’s head to\r\nthe wind and sea. No ventilators showed their unsightly mouths above the\r\nvery broad teak top-rail, for they were not needed; but more than the\r\nregulation number of boats--about eighty, all hoisted electrically--hung\r\nfrom massive davits, some being electric launches. No great forty-feet\r\nwide funnels to hold the wind; no top-hampering superstructures broke\r\nthe deck area, save the deck stairway houses and the wide bridge, with\r\nits chart-room, captain’s sanctum, and binnacle house, in which a wheel\r\nthat a child could turn operated the steering-gear, consisting of a\r\ngreat toothed pinion wheel keyed to the enormous rudder, and worked by\r\ntwo electric motors used alternately.\r\n\r\nFrom end to end was a double striped and fringed awning. The _Princess_\r\ncarried a search-light of enormous range and power on her foremast, and\r\nher sidelights were disposed without any disfiguring effect on her\r\nstarboard and port bows, and not in miniature Eddystones. Her anchor\r\ngear, worked by electricity, was the heaviest ever made, and resembled\r\nthat of the largest battleship.\r\n\r\nOver all floated the red merchant flag of Great Britain, 40 feet by 24\r\nfeet, the flag of the South African Commonwealth, the Blue Peter at the\r\nfore, and above the taffrail the beautiful blue ensign of the Royal\r\nNaval Reserve, while in honour of this her maiden voyage she was dressed\r\nrainbow-fashion with innumerable pennons.\r\n\r\nThe hull was built on the cellular principle, divided into water-tight\r\ncompartments up to above the waterline, the decks or floors being ten\r\nin number. The mighty hold, and the space where bunkers would have been\r\nin an ordinary steamer, were filled with storage batteries; so that an\r\nimmense area was at disposal for electric power, renewed daily by a\r\nwonderful chemical process, the weight of the batteries--in this case an\r\nadvantage--taking the place of ballast, keeping the _Princess Ida_ at an\r\nalmost unvarying draught.\r\n\r\nRelatively the machinery of the _Princess Ida_ was simplicity itself.\r\nShe had three propellers that _looked_ inadequate to move so vast a\r\nbulk. There were no quadruple expansion-balanced engines with cylinders\r\nof 28, 41, 58, and 84 inches in diameter, and no bewildering gathering\r\nof cranks, pistons, rods, and levers, but the shafts were coupled direct\r\nto enormous electric motors which turned them with resistless force,\r\nwithout the loss involved in the use of a long propeller-shaft. There\r\nwas no escaping steam, no heat, no stuffy stokehold and fierce\r\nboilers, no smell of oil and waste, and the ventilation was almost as\r\nperfect as on deck.\r\n\r\nGoing on board by the central gangway reserved for foot-passengers, one\r\nentered a splendid hall fifty feet high and a hundred feet square,\r\nresembling the lounge saloon of a big hotel, with glass dome-shaped\r\nskylight above--a winter garden with beds of flowers and groups of\r\nsea-loving palms at the side, kept-renewed throughout the voyage;\r\nseductive easy-chairs and couches scattered about; tables here and\r\nthere, covered with periodicals and writing material; while at one end\r\nof a platform, used by the ship’s band, and forming a miniature stage,\r\nwas a grand piano backed by a handsome curtain of peacock-blue plush,\r\nand, facing it, a fine organ, both instruments strictly reserved for\r\npublic entertainments, theatrical and otherwise. The walls of this\r\nbeautiful saloon were of polished New Zealand woods, Kauri pine\r\npredominating, than which a lighter and more elegant wainscot can hardly\r\nbe imagined. Fireplaces with ornate overmantels burnt logs of wood--a\r\nsacrifice to conventionality and sentiment, as they were not required\r\nfor warmth, the ship being lighted and heated throughout by electricity.\r\n\r\nIn general arrangement the interior of the ship reminded one of a modern\r\nhotel, and the illusion was heightened by the port-holes on the main or\r\nsecond deck being so arranged as to resemble plate-glass windows set in\r\nframes of great strength, and when the vessel began to move on the\r\nwaters it was as if a section of the Cecil Hotel had floated off into\r\nthe river. But, though beautifully furnished, the ship was not overdone\r\nwith meaningless decoration. Mirrors were restricted in number, and\r\nthere was but little gilding. Rare paintings of ships, birds, and\r\nflowers were on the walls, while wood-carvings in the style of Grinling\r\nGibbons and delicate French bronzes beautified unsightly corners. All\r\nthe decks were covered with india-rubber laid over fireproof planking,\r\nreducing noise to a minimum, those below the upper deck being carpeted;\r\nand as all the doors were sliding and shut noiselessly, the general\r\neffect of quietude was delightful, even the electric gongs being subdued\r\nin tone.\r\n\r\nThe style of upholstery throughout was that of the latest Victorian Era,\r\nmodified to meet the requirements of life at sea. There was, of course,\r\na very grand dining-saloon, and smaller ones for private parties; also a\r\nprincipal drawing-room, boudoirs, tea-rooms, and in the transoms (_i.e._\r\nthe aftermost part of the ship) one small and purely ornamental parlour\r\nin imitation of Princess Ida’s in her college--\r\n\r\n                                “.... a court\r\n    Compact of lucid marbles, boss’d with lengths\r\n    Of classic frieze with ample awnings gay\r\n    Betwixt the pillars, and with great urns of flowers”--\r\n\r\nwhere a statue of that divinity, seated on a throne, with a couple of\r\ntame leopards on each side, was placed as a kind of tutelary genius, to\r\nwhich the sentimental ladies on board made weekly offerings of the\r\nchoicest flowers they could get.\r\n\r\nThen there had been skilfully provided in this wonderful ship a small\r\noratory for the use of Roman Catholic passengers, several libraries,\r\nreading and lecture rooms, a music-room, a cardroom, smoking saloons of\r\ncourse, a billiard-room, (available in very fine weather), swimming or\r\nrather plunge baths, and electric and ordinary baths in abundance made\r\nof aluminium; besides massage-rooms, coiffeurs’ and barbers’ saloons, a\r\nshooting-gallery, a post and telegraph office, a gymnasium, a\r\nskating-rink, a bowling-alley, a photographic room, an amateur’s\r\nworkshop, an apartment specially set apart for ping-pong and similar\r\ngames, American bars, and a miniature cafe for the pleasure of those who\r\nwould make believe they were still ashore; a tennis-court, a miniature\r\ngolf-link, a small running, walking, and cycle track (quoits, cricket,\r\nhockey, and even football could always be enjoyed on the upper deck), an\r\naviary (parrots prohibited), a natural history room, an aquarium, a\r\nservants’ hall, a nursery (a remote locality) with tracks for\r\nperambulators; small shops for confectionery, millinery, hosiery, and\r\ntobacco; also a printing-press, a dispensary, and a hospital; a cell for\r\ninsubordinates, and, alas! a mortuary.[11]\r\n\r\nOn the upper deck--so great was the distance from stem to stern, twice\r\nup and down being more than a mile--small electric trolley-chairs were\r\nat the disposal of the old or infirm to enable them to take open-air\r\nexercise. A wide shelter-promenade ran round the ship’s sides between\r\ntwo of the decks, looking out on the sea through spacious port-holes,\r\nand when wind and rain were too pronounced there were the roomy\r\nstairway houses on deck wherein to take refuge.\r\n\r\nOn every floor there were lifts for those who cared to use them. The\r\ntelegraph and telephone made intercommunication easy, and at every\r\ncorner of the ship, with its maze of corridors and staircases,\r\ndirection-tablets indicated one’s whereabouts.\r\n\r\nFamilies were accommodated with furnished suites of private rooms, which\r\ncould be rented or even leased. Here they could bring their own\r\nservants, and be boarded independently of the other travellers. These\r\nsuites varied in size from a modest sitting-room and bedroom for\r\nsolitary couples, to flats suitable for a large number. There were\r\nbedrooms (not cabins) for spinsters and bachelors, and double-bedded\r\nrooms. The familiar two, four, and six open-berthed staterooms were\r\nconspicuous by their absence.\r\n\r\nOf regulations there were few, and these were framed for the general\r\ngood and were strictly enforced. No dogs or cats were allowed in any\r\npart of the ship; the playing upon any instrument, except in the\r\nmusic-room, was prohibited, and this applied even to the private suites;\r\nsmall children and babies were kept absolutely separate from the adults,\r\nand smoking was forbidden except in saloons set apart for that purpose\r\nand in private rooms.\r\n\r\nAll cookery was done by electricity,[12] supplemented by charcoal, and\r\nthe scale of provisions that had to be dealt with, apart from the ship’s\r\nstores for the crew, was Gargantuan, while fresh fruit, fish, etc., were\r\nalways obtained in addition at the various stopping places. For the\r\nround voyage, with allowance for accidents, say forty-two days in all,\r\nthere had to be put on board for the passengers: of fish, 36,000 lbs.;\r\nfresh meat (beef, mutton, lamb, veal, and pork), 367,700 lbs.; fowls and\r\nchickens, 16,000; ducks, 1,800; geese, 950; turkeys, 1,500; partridges,\r\ngrouse, etc., 3,600 brace; 260 tons of potatoes; 560 hampers of\r\nvegetables; 4,000 quarts of ice-cream; 18,000 quarts of milk; 215,000\r\neggs; also canned goods, butter, flour, and groceries in proportion. Of\r\nchampagne, 18,000 bottles; 15,000 of claret; 110,000 of ale; 45,000 of\r\nstout; 87,000 of mineral waters; and 10,000 bottles of various spirits.\r\nAll these, except the stimulants, were preserved in chilled rooms, the\r\nice being made on board.\r\n\r\nAt a pinch the _Princess Ida_ could accommodate--besides her crew of\r\nfour hundred, a small army of servants, the stewards, and stewardesses\r\n(there were no stokers or firemen)--six thousand souls; but to ensure\r\ncomfort, only 3,500 passengers were as a rule booked, necessarily at\r\nhigh rates. All were of one class, the only difference, as in an hotel,\r\nbeing in the price paid for position.\r\n\r\nThe officers were comfortably quartered in the forward part of the ship\r\nin a manner equal to the first class of many a steamer; the crew\r\nbeneath, in the so-called forecastle, palatial in comparison with the\r\nold-fashioned sailing ship.\r\n\r\nBy the time the handy-man had taken these notes H. M.’s mails arrived\r\nalongside, and were put on board by electric trolleys through the\r\ncentral side port. There was no stupefying, deafening escape of steam,\r\nand no maddening ringing of great bells. The Blue Peter--some fifteen\r\nfeet square--fluttered down from the foremast, and a megaphone in\r\nsonorous tones announced that the hour of departure had arrived, and\r\nthat visitors must leave for the shore.\r\n\r\nThe _Ida_ began to show that she could move, and majestically and slowly\r\nshifted her position, until her bow pointed seaward, a mighty cheer\r\ngoing up from quay and ship. An unseen orchestra gave forth “Auld Lang\r\nSyne,” and in the fading light the _Princess Ida_, glowing with\r\nincandescents, her syren sounding at intervals, disappeared in the river\r\nfog on her maiden voyage.\r\n\r\nGoing down channel at an easy fifteen knots, it was immediately\r\nnoticeable how remarkably steady the great ship was in the choppy sea.\r\nThere was an entire absence of vibration, partly attributable to the\r\nmetal of which she was constructed, and to the perfect balancing of her\r\nmachinery and nice adjustment of weight throughout her holds. Even in\r\nthe Bay of Biscay, which was wavelessly heavy in long, sullen rollers\r\nafter a mighty storm from the west had died away, the _Princess_ behaved\r\nlike a real sea-lady, yielding slowly, but steadily, to the _force\r\nmajeur_ of the Atlantic; and no one dreamt of being sea-sick except one\r\nvery bilious-looking gentleman, a heavy eater, hailing from Brazil.\r\n\r\nIn short, she proved herself to be a splendid sea-boat. Not a drop of\r\nwater could reach her upper decks; pitch she hardly could, as her great\r\nlength enabled her to ride quietly across the valleys between oncoming\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nA few hours’ detention at beautiful Madeira, and shortly afterwards\r\nTeneriffe was reached, where it began to be warm; but the ship was so\r\nspacious, and was kept so cool by means of refrigerators, electric fans,\r\nand--when necessary--punkahs, that no one felt in the least\r\ninconvenienced by the heat. There were no smuts, no smoke, and, better\r\nstill, no smell of oil or paint (neither of these being used on the\r\nship), no cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies, or rats!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. ELECTRIC LAUNCH ON THE THAMES\r\n\r\n_By permission of the_ _Immisch Electric Launch Co., Ltd., London_]\r\n\r\nHere she began to put on speed, working up to eighteen knots an hour,\r\nher maximum (very great speed being no special consideration), and it\r\nwas then observed that so smooth and tapering were her lines, that she\r\nslipped through the water raising but little bow wave, and almost as\r\nfrictionless as a swift ocean-fish.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so at lonely Ascension, and the same at St. Helena--in each\r\ncase to deliver and receive mails, and to keep up telegraphic\r\ncommunication with London--a voyage altogether of wondrous beauty and\r\nenjoyment, nights of solemn loveliness, and days that broke in perfect\r\nsplendour, cloudless, save for little patches of white here and there,\r\nand the ocean a dazzling radiance of deep blue.\r\n\r\nCape Town--six thousand miles in sixteen days out from Tilbury--and,\r\ngreeted by thousands who had flocked from far and near to witness the\r\nsight, the _Princess Ida_ glided to her berth inside the great\r\nbreakwater.\r\n\r\nAnd there for the present I must leave her.\r\n\r\nI think I have demonstrated that, theoretically at least, the tiny\r\nelectric launches, put on the Thames in 1889 by the Immisch Company, one\r\nof which, the _Lammda_, took the then Prince of Wales through Boulter’s\r\nLock, was the forerunner of the ocean steamer of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nBut there is no absolute novelty under the sun; for it is stated that in\r\n1838 a distinguished Roman scientist, Jacobi, invented an electric motor\r\nwhich drove a small boat on the Neva at two miles an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_SOME ELECTRIC LOCOMOTION DRAWBACKS_\r\n\r\n    “Perfection is attained by slow degrees; she requires the\r\n       hand of time.”--VOLTAIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL’S ADVOCATE\r\n\r\nLittle more need be said as to the advantages of the new order of\r\nthings, for however technical opinions may differ about the relative\r\nadvantages of steam or electricity, there cannot be any doubt that the\r\npublic fully recognise the immense superiority of the latter in details\r\nof cleanliness and general comfort.\r\n\r\nTube railways are intensely disliked by some people, and as heartily\r\nappreciated by millions of others. That they are an advantage in many\r\nways is unquestionable, though they are not yet without defects.\r\nMotor-cars (electric or petrol), to those who use them, appear to be the\r\nsafest and most delightful of vehicles, but here again perfection has\r\nnot been reached.\r\n\r\nWith these four well-known forms of traction I must now deal, and not\r\neulogisticallv. In the old days when some recluse renowned for his\r\nholiness--which he had instanced by living unwashed for years in a hair\r\nshirt until it fell to pieces--died, his admirers frequently put in a\r\nclaim for his canonisation. This necessitated the appointment of an\r\nindividual called the _Advocatus Diaboli_, a leader of the opposition,\r\nwhose duty it was to raise all kinds of objections to the granting of\r\nthe sacred honour, and to recall everything possible to the detriment\r\nof the candidate. Not a pleasant task, certainly, but not altogether\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nAfter this fashion it is fair to bring up some sort of a case against\r\nelectric traction.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC RAILWAY ACCIDENTS AND BREAKDOWNS\r\n\r\nAs regards electric railway accidents and blockings of tubes, the\r\n_Advocatus Diaboli_ is able to quote rather too many examples.\r\nCommencing with the United States, where in July, 1902, a car,\r\ndescending the mountain on the Mountain and Lake Electric Railway, near\r\nGloversville, where the grade is a thousand feet in four miles, became\r\nuncontrollable, and, acquiring frightful velocity, collided with another\r\ncar which was ascending the slope. Both cars rushed down several feet,\r\nand then ran off the rails. Each car contained seventy passengers, and\r\nof these fifteen were killed and injured. Ten bodies, mangled beyond\r\nrecognition, were taken from the wreckage. Most of the victims were\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAt home there is the disastrous Liverpool Electric Overhead Railway fire\r\nof December 23rd, 1901. The trains are run on the multiple control\r\nprinciple, a motor at each end, and the accident was due to a defect in\r\nthe rear one. But as it is a typical case, I will quote in full the\r\ncause of the accident, as assigned by Lieutenant-Colonel H. A. Yorke,\r\nthe Board of Trade Inspector. He says: “A gale of wind was blowing from\r\nthe west, that is, from the mouth of the tunnel towards the station,\r\nwhich caused the fire to spread from carriage to carriage until the\r\nwhole train was enveloped in flames. It is estimated that the train was\r\nwell alight about twelve minutes after the stoppage. There were\r\ntwenty-nine passengers, who, when the train first came to a stand, were\r\nurged by the driver and guard to keep their seats, as there was no\r\ndanger. The driver and guard seem to have made some futile attempts to\r\nput out the fire; but it soon became apparent that the fire had obtained\r\nthe mastery, and the passengers found it necessary to alight. They had\r\nonly eighty yards to walk in order to reach the station, and the\r\nmajority of them appear to have gone to their homes without any delay,\r\nand to have suffered no ill-effects from the fire. It appears, however,\r\nfrom the evidence that a few remained behind, presumably to watch the\r\nprogress of the conflagration and the result of the effort to control\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe inspector went on to say that in his opinion it would have been\r\nproductive of no serious danger had only the driver acted with a\r\nmoderate degree of prudence. When this man discovered that his rear\r\nmotor had failed his duty was to disconnect his rear motor by means of\r\nthe plug provided for the purpose in his apartment. He should then have\r\nrun into the station with one motor, as is often done. For some reason\r\nor other, which cannot be conjectured, the driver, instead of\r\ndisconnecting the defective motor, and in disregard of the warning of\r\nthe guard, made repeated efforts to bring it into use, the result being\r\nthat before long the woodwork of the rear carriage was ignited by the\r\nflashes produced by the electric arc when the current was switched on to\r\nthe defective motor. While the driver was so employed both he and the\r\nguard appear to have told the passengers to keep their seats, as there\r\nwas no danger. Both these men and the station foreman seem to have\r\nexhibited a lamentable lack of judgment in this respect. It is\r\nimpossible not to feel that the sacrifice of life might have been\r\neasily avoided. If the passengers had been hurried out of the train as\r\nsoon as it became evident that it had broken down, and if none of them\r\nhad been permitted to loiter about the station, their safety would have\r\nbeen secured. And if the train men and station foreman, who deserve\r\ncredit for their efforts to prevent the fire from spreading, had only\r\nrealised sooner that the train was doomed, they too had ample time to\r\nescape. The cutting off of the current did no good, but, by putting the\r\nplace in darkness, rather increased the difficulties and danger of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of the disaster is, that all woodwork should be removed as\r\nfar as possible from the electric machinery of the railway carriages,\r\nand that for the purpose of insulation material should be employed which\r\nis uninflammable.\r\n\r\nOf blocks or stoppages on tube railways the following are examples.\r\n\r\nSerious inconvenience was caused on December 30th, 1901, by a mishap on\r\nthe Central London Railway. It appeared that just before five o’clock in\r\nthe morning a motor was being shunted into the Bank Station to take the\r\nfirst train to Shepherd’s Bush, when, though going dead slow, some of\r\nthe gear apparently fouled the current rail, and it jumped the points\r\njust where the two tunnels join, and effectually prevented any train\r\nentering or leaving either. The nearest “cross-over,” by which trains\r\ncould be shunted from one to the other, was at the British Museum\r\nStation, but even timely notice did not make the walk through the wet\r\nany the more attractive to business men, the rain having caused all the\r\nomnibuses to be filled long before they got to the station gates. When\r\nthe line was constructed it was proposed to make a second siding at the\r\nBank as at Shepherd’s Bush, and had this been done there would have\r\nbeen no dislocation of traffic, but fears for the effects of vibration\r\non buildings above vetoed the proposal. On an ordinary railway a\r\npowerful crane would probably have been run alongside, but the space in\r\nthe tube is so circumscribed that it was with the utmost difficulty that\r\nthe engine, which weighed forty-four tons, and was resting against the\r\nside of the tunnel, could be moved. As the afternoon wore on, crowds of\r\nCity men gathered in the subway in the hope that the obstruction would\r\nsoon be removed, but it was not till five o’clock that the line was\r\ncleared and the traffic resumed.\r\n\r\nOnce more the Twopenny Tube distinguished itself by a stoppage. It was\r\non December 30th, 1902, the anniversary of the precisely similar mishap\r\nin 1901, but fortunately with less serious results. Then the engine fell\r\nagainst the side of the tube, and the workmen could only get at one\r\nside of it; but this one settled itself in such a position that jacks\r\ncould be got to work under both sides. The points at the terminus very\r\nmuch resemble those at the ends of the tram lines, and with the\r\ntremendous traffic passing over them (engines 1,200 times a day) the\r\nonly wonder is that accidents of this kind do not occur more often than\r\nonce a year. With a curious perversity, the engine chose the time--four\r\no’clock in the afternoon--when it would cause the maximum of\r\ninconvenience, and the thousands of City men and women going home\r\nrealised more fully than ever the advantage of the tube. The nearest\r\ncross-over is between the British Museum and Chancery Lane, and notice\r\nwas at once given that trains were running between the former station\r\nand the western terminus. As soon as possible gangs of men got to work,\r\nand within an hour and a half the wheels were got on, but unfortunately\r\nit was very difficult to see what had caused the mishap, as in getting\r\nthe motor back the evidences of the cause were removed. Some little\r\ndelay was occasioned by straightening the bent rails, but at half-past\r\neight an engine was run to and fro over the points to see that they were\r\nall right again, and a few minutes later the message was sent to all\r\nstations: “Resumed bookings and ordinary working.”\r\n\r\nThese mishaps showed how necessary it was that, instead of cross-overs,\r\nloops should be provided, round which trains could be run.\r\n\r\nJanuary 16th, 1902, witnessed an accident on the City and South London\r\nElectric Railway, happily unattended with serious consequences. A train\r\nleft the Elephant and Castle Station shortly after seven a.m., and had\r\nproceeded some two hundred yards towards the Borough when what is\r\ntechnically known as a “short” occurred in the switch. This means,\r\nroughly, that the current had chosen to go a way of its own instead of\r\nthrough the insulated wires to the motor. Hence, an “arc” was\r\nproduced--that is, an arc lamp on a large scale. The insulating material\r\nbegan to burn and smell and smoke. Small defects of this kind are common\r\nenough, and the flame is frequently put out with the driver’s hand or\r\ncap. On this occasion the flame resisted all efforts to put it out, and\r\nthe driver had to stop the cars and send back for assistance. The\r\nfollowing trains came on slowly, and the engine pushed the broken-down\r\npredecessor on to the Borough Station. It was found necessary to ask the\r\npassengers (fortunately numbering only about thirty or forty) to leave\r\nthe train, and the fire was then easily extinguished, though it was\r\nfound necessary to cut off the current from the generating station for\r\na short time. The line was only blocked for about an hour, and the\r\naccident was of little importance except as illustrating one advantage\r\nwhich, it is said, the “engine” system of electric traction possesses\r\nover the “multiple unit.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL OBJECTIONS TO TUBE TRAVELLING\r\n\r\nBut apart from accidents and breakdowns, a terrible indictment is\r\nbrought against tube railways in general, and the Central London in\r\nparticular, which, if true, constitutes a veritable drawback. The\r\naccuser is Dr. L. C. Parkes, Medical Officer of Health for Chelsea, who\r\nsays: “Tube railways are still such a comparative novelty, that the\r\nquestion of the healthiness of this mode of travel has not yet been\r\nfully determined. Dr. Wynter Blyth, in an address a year ago, gave the\r\nresults of some experiments on the ventilation and condition of the\r\natmosphere in the tubes and stations of the Central London Railway. The\r\nchief cause of the movements of air in the tubes and stations, lifts and\r\nstairways, is the passage of the trains along the tubes, which the\r\ncarriages nearly fill, thus acting as a piston in a cylinder, driving\r\nair before them and sucking it in from behind in their progress from one\r\nstation to another. The condition of the atmosphere, was not excessively\r\nfoul, the largest amount of CO ascertained to be present, being 11·9\r\nparts per 10,000 vols. This sample was taken in a carriage containing\r\ntwenty-seven people between the Lancaster Gate and Marble Arch Stations.\r\nThe amount of CO present in the air of the station’s lifts and stairways\r\nvaried between 8 and 11 parts per 10,000. In no case, then, did Dr.\r\nWynter Blyth find the amount of CO in the air of the tube to be more\r\nthan three times the amount usually present in the outer atmosphere of\r\nthe London streets (average 4 parts per 10,000). Contrasted with the\r\ntunnel of the Metropolitan Railway between Gower Street and King’s Cross\r\nStations, where a sample of the air taken showed that CO was present to\r\nthe extent of 25·9 parts per 10,000, the air of the tube railway is\r\ncomparatively pure.”\r\n\r\nDr. Parkes continues: “It may be safely asserted that constant\r\ntravelling day after day, even if only for a limited period each day, in\r\nan atmosphere containing 15 to 20 parts per 10,000 of CO, such CO being\r\nderived solely from a human source, must eventually tend to injure\r\nhealth. There are two other dangers in tube-travelling which require\r\nnotice. First, the danger in the warm summer and the cold winter months\r\nalike of bodily chill. In the hot weather the traveller passes suddenly\r\nfrom the warm street into a much colder atmosphere below the ground\r\nlevel. In the winter the reverse happens--the passenger who has been\r\nwarmed and enervated by the devitalised air below meets the chilly\r\nwintry blast on emerging into the street. Secondly, the air of the tube\r\nbeing very dry, and constantly in movement, there must be much organic\r\ndust of human origin floating in it. The dangers of tubercular\r\nexpectoration are no doubt intensified in such a dry and shifting\r\natmosphere as that of the tube, and the cautionary notices to prevent\r\nspitting are wisely exhibited in every carriage.”\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Dr. Parkes favours open air to other methods of\r\ntravelling. He recommends that as far as possible travelling should be\r\nby routes open to the air of heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_SOME ELECTRIC LOCOMOTION DRAWBACKS (continued)_\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAMWAY ACCIDENTS\r\n\r\nWhen the Chiswick High Road tram-line was being made the tradesmen\r\npetitioned the London County Council against it. They complained of the\r\nannoyance as well as of the danger of the trams. They said that the\r\ntrams, being large (carrying seventy people in all) and running on eight\r\nwheels, made considerably more noise than the light horse-car; that the\r\nmotor was not silent, and the progress of the trolley along the\r\nshivering overhead wire made a continuous, most unmusical, and\r\npenetrating din; while the brake--of necessity powerful--also had a\r\nharsh note quite its own. To this was added the noise and flash of\r\nelectric sparks and a singularly sonorous and imperative bell in place\r\nof the usual whistle; and as the cars came along every two and a half\r\nminutes in each direction, they who dwelt along the route did not find\r\nthem altogether lovely.\r\n\r\nSome people maintain that electric trams are not merely unlovely, but\r\nare decidedly dangerous to travel in. There have been electric tram\r\naccidents, of course, and very serious ones. For instance, at\r\nHuddersfield, one June night in 1902, a car, as it approached the town\r\nand was half-way down an incline of a mile in length, got out of\r\ncontrol. The trolley arm left the wire, plunging the conveyance into\r\ndarkness. By this time the pace of the car was too great to permit of\r\nanyone getting off. It went whizzing past the car standing in the next\r\nloop; but failing to negotiate a sharp curve at the bottom of Somerset\r\nRoad, ran straight across the street, smashing the pavement and dashing\r\nwith great force into a grocer’s shop, the wooden front of which\r\ncollapsed. The front of the car was also driven in. Three persons were\r\nkilled and six seriously injured.\r\n\r\nAt Chatham a catastrophe, resulting in four deaths and many injuries, is\r\nstill fresh in people’s minds. It occurred on October 30th, 1902, and\r\nwas extraordinary in many respects, the tram being completely wrecked.\r\nThe Chatham and District Light Railway is worked as an electric tramway\r\non the overhead trolley system, and has been in operation about twelve\r\nmonths. The scene of the mishap was at the foot of Westcourt Street, Old\r\nBrompton, in the parish of Gillingham, close to the main entrance to\r\nChatham Dockyard, where there is a very steep gradient. A workmen’s car,\r\nfilled with mechanics and labourers on their way to work, suddenly\r\nbolted in descending the hill, notwithstanding that the brakes had been\r\nduly applied. The weight of the heavily laden vehicle increased the\r\nvelocity every yard of the way, and a terrific pace was obtained.\r\n\r\nThere is a sharp curve in the railway at the end of the road. The\r\npassengers screamed as they realised their danger. The driver shouted to\r\nthem to jump off the car, which many did; and the driver and conductor\r\nthemselves took a leap for their lives, and thus avoided serious injury.\r\nAs anticipated, the curve proved fatal to the safety of the car. The\r\nheavy vehicle toppled over on its side with a terrific crash, and the\r\npassengers, projected in all directions, made a confused heap in the\r\nhighway.\r\n\r\nThose who were not seriously injured struggled to their feet, but others\r\nremained prostrate, unable to move, shrieking or groaning with pain, and\r\nseveral more were rendered insensible. Assistance was speedily\r\nforthcoming, and the sufferers were removed to the Royal Naval Hospital,\r\nwhich is within a stone’s-throw of the scene of the accident.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year a remarkable accident took place at\r\nGlasgow, also with fatal results. About half-past nine one Saturday\r\nnight, when the streets were at their busiest, a Possilpark car got out\r\nof the driver’s control, and began to move down a slope of Renfield\r\nStreet, which is the main car artery of Glasgow. Where Renfield Street\r\ncuts Sauchiehall Street, the principal thoroughfare of the city, the\r\nvehicle dashed into a Pollokshields car, standing at the junction. Both\r\ncars left the rails, and the runaway, without perceptible interruption,\r\ncontinued on its career, driving the other before it, the conductors’\r\nplatforms being interlocked. A few yards further on a Dennistown car was\r\nencountered. The two locked cars swept down, and, driving the third in\r\nfront of them, continued their course down to Argyle Street, a distance\r\nof about six hundred yards. A long succession of cars was moving\r\nupwards, and with the momentum the three heavy cars had then attained a\r\ndisaster seemed imminent. However, where the Dennistown line, coming out\r\nof St. Vincent Place, joins Renfield Street, the foremost of the three\r\nrunaways took the branch points, swerved with such speed that it failed\r\nto keep the rails, and plunged headlong across the street, being\r\neventually brought up by the wall of a shop. The second and third cars,\r\nstill locked together, followed the former, striking the shop almost at\r\nthe same point.\r\n\r\nAt Devonport another accident, resulting in death, occurred the same\r\nmonth. About nine o’clock in the morning, a car containing eight\r\npassengers, six of whom were on the top, got beyond the control of the\r\ndriver on the incline leading to the South-Western Railway Station. The\r\npowerful brakes were promptly applied, but failed to check the progress\r\nof the car, which rapidly gathered momentum, although the reversing gear\r\nwas also applied at full pressure.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the slope, where the line takes a sharp curve into one of\r\nthe main roads to Devonport, the vehicle, which had by this time\r\nattained a terrific pace, jumped the rails, crossed the road, and dashed\r\ninto a wall enclosing the carriage entrance to the station. The force of\r\nthe impact broke the wall, and caused the car itself partly to topple\r\nover. Some of the terrified passengers on the top jumped into the\r\nroadway, and others were thrown off. One young man, in jumping off,\r\nsucceeded in clearing the car and the wall, but as he alighted in the\r\nroadway, which slopes down to the entrance of the station, a piece of\r\ngranite coping, weighing several hundredweight, dislodged by the force\r\nof the collision, fell on his head, death being instantaneous. Other\r\ninjured persons were lying in the roadway some distance from the wrecked\r\ncar, the upper part of which was a shapeless mass of broken seats and\r\ntwisted rails. The position of the car enabled it to be seen that the\r\nbrakes were gripping the wheels lightly, while the wooden brakes, which\r\nact on the lines, appeared to be down to the utmost extent.\r\n\r\nIn this case the verdict of the coroner’s court coincided with the Board\r\nof Trade’s subsequent report, to the effect that the accident was\r\nbrought about by the negligence and incapacity of the driver of the car,\r\nthe Board of Trade adding that the cause was excessive speed on a steep\r\ngradient and sharp curve, that the driver was responsible for the\r\naccident in failing to use the brake-power, and in disobeying the\r\ncompany’s orders by leaving the stopping-place without a signal.\r\n\r\nThese runnings away of electric trams called for increased attention to\r\nthe question of brakes, which, though they will always hold a car on a\r\nstiff incline on dry rails, yet when the track is greasy they introduce\r\nan element of danger by reason of their very power. They skid the\r\nwheels, which is always a source of great danger. In such cases safety\r\nlies in relaxing the pressure, but it needs a wary brain and firm nerves\r\nto ease off the brake at all when the car has already bolted.\r\n\r\nThen there are collisions, which luckily seldom occur. In October last\r\none took place between two electric tramcars between Middleton and\r\nRhodes, near Manchester. The cars were carrying workmen, and the\r\naccident occurred near what is known as the Parkfield loop. The vehicles\r\nwere travelling in opposite directions, and owing to some cause, at\r\npresent unexplained, they both got on the same line, instead of one\r\nwaiting on the loop. About twelve of the passengers were more or less\r\nhurt by broken glass, and one of the drivers was injured about the leg.\r\n\r\nCars can be completely overturned, as was proved by an incident that\r\nhappened in December last year to one of the London County Council\r\ntrams. It left the metals at St. George’s Circus, and after jolting\r\nalong for a few yards slowly toppled over into a ditch three feet deep,\r\nwhich had been dug on the near side for the purpose of laying the\r\nelectrical connections. There were about ten passengers on the top and\r\ntwelve inside, and the tram was already overturning before they had\r\nfully realised their danger. Fortunately they retained their presence of\r\nmind, and those on the top, by clinging to the rails, prevented\r\nthemselves from being hurled into the roadway. Two small boys, who were\r\nunable to retain their grip of the rail when the side of the car struck\r\nthe ground, were thrown off into the gutter, but escaped with little\r\nmore than a few cuts and a severe shaking. The cause was difficult to\r\ndiscover, but probably as the lines were being rearranged some piece of\r\niron or other hard substance eluded the observation of those put to\r\nwatch, got into the groove of the metals, and caused the car to jump the\r\nrail at a spot where excavations were being made.\r\n\r\nIn our climate tramway traffic is not exposed to any very inclement\r\nweather, so that electric traction is not likely to prove a failure by\r\nreason of heavy snowfalls, as in New York last winter during a blizzard.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC SHOCKS\r\n\r\nThere is a serious feature in the overhead trolley system which ought\r\nnot to be overlooked, as the following will show. In the centre of\r\nSunderland four principal streets cross, and here, about eight o’clock\r\none Saturday night in August, 1902, when the thoroughfares were\r\ncongested with people, the trolley-arm of a tram-car became entangled,\r\nand no fewer than three live electric wires snapped. A woman received a\r\nsevere shock through one of them striking an iron handrail on the tram\r\nwhich she was boarding; but the promptitude of a motor inspector in\r\nturning off the current averted further personal injury.\r\n\r\nThe Fulham Public Baths tragedy at the beginning of this year\r\nexemplified the fact that it does not require a high alternative current\r\nto kill. Under certain conditions 200 volts are sufficient. Criminals\r\nare electrocuted at a voltage of 2,000, the current passes in at the\r\nskull. The murderous elephant, Topsy, in New York paid the penalty of\r\nher misdeeds by having a current of 6,600 volts passed through her, and\r\ndied in ten seconds; but a minute before, she had swallowed 460 grains\r\nof cyanide of potassium!\r\n\r\nMy own personal experience somewhat resembles that of the woman at\r\nSunderland. It was at Ramsgate on a rainy day, and, the car being full\r\ninside, I had to travel outside, seats, metal-work, and everything being\r\nnaturally very wet, and in taking hold of the iron framing of a seat I\r\nexperienced so strong a shock that I called up the conductor. He\r\nridiculed the idea, but while he was arguing the matter out, contending\r\nthat it was an impossibility, he inadvertently grasped the wet\r\ntrolley-pole, which gave him such an electric sensation that he yelled\r\nand fell flat on the roof. The car had to be stopped, and until the rain\r\nceased no passengers were allowed outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTOR-CAR ACCIDENTS\r\n\r\nBy those who dislike them, every imaginable evil is laid at the doors,\r\nor, rather, the wheels of motor-cars, whether propelled by petrol or\r\nelectricity, and recorded accidents are quoted, chapter and verse being\r\ngiven to show that they are the enemies of pedestrian, driving, and\r\ncycling mankind. Here are some examples.\r\n\r\nOn a steep hill in the neighbourhood of Grimsthorpe, near Bourne, on May\r\n25th, 1902, a motor-car got out of control and overturned. The driver,\r\nemployed by Lord Willoughby de Eresby, M.P., for whom the vehicle had\r\nbeen built at Birmingham, was instantaneously killed, his skull being\r\nfractured. He had brought the car to Grimsthorpe Castle only the\r\nprevious evening, and was out with a party of friends, mostly Lord\r\nAncaster’s employés, when the accident happened. One man was badly\r\ninjured, and two others of the party received slight injuries, but a\r\nchild, who was flung over a hedge, escaped unhurt.\r\n\r\nThe following day a motor-car was being driven down a steep hill just\r\noutside Stroud, when the brake failed to act, and the car ran violently\r\ninto a stone wall, carrying part of it away. One of the occupants, a\r\nlocal cloth manufacturer, was seriously injured, and a gentleman who\r\naccompanied him escaped with some ugly bruises.\r\n\r\nAn accident occurred near Rearsby, Leicestershire, on August 9th, 1902,\r\nwhereby the master of the Quorn Hunt, Captain Burns Hartopp, and Mr. A.\r\nBurnaby were injured. The party were motoring from Little Dalby Hall to\r\nQuorn, when, near Rearsby, the car ran into a cow, with the result that\r\nthe occupants were pitched out and the car was wrecked. Captain Burns\r\nHartopp was picked up in a semi-conscious condition, Mr. Burnaby was\r\nmore seriously injured, while Mr. Dashwood escaped with a shaking.\r\n\r\nA curious escape was witnessed the same day at Monmouth. General Sir\r\nEvelyn Wood, who was accompanied by Colonel Grierson, acting Q.M.G., and\r\nCaptain Wood, A.D.C., had been inspecting the Monmouth Royal Engineers\r\n(Militia) under the command of Lord Raglan. Afterwards the General and\r\nstaff proceeded in a motor-car to Abergavenny. While the machine was\r\nbeing reversed towards the entrance of the Angel Hotel a brake refused\r\nto work, and the car mounted the pavement and ran into the wall of a\r\nshop, just missing a plate-glass window. Captain Wood, who had alighted,\r\nnarrowly escaped being caught between the motor and the wall.\r\n\r\nThe following month a motor-car accident occurred at Barnet, when the\r\nHon. C. S. Rolls was returning home in a motor-car from Barnet Fair. Mr.\r\nRolls saw a trap containing three or four persons approaching him, and\r\nhe steered his car into the hedge, but a collision could not be avoided.\r\nOne of the occupants of the trap--a youth--was thrown to the ground, and\r\nthe horse was cut on the leg. Mr. Rolls escaped with a slight shaking.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of October last, while motoring from Chester, the Rev.\r\nArthur Guest, vicar of Lower Peover, with his wife and a friend, had a\r\nstartling experience. In steering past a milkcart near Lostock Chemical\r\nWorks, the car ran into a brick wall and was overturned and badly\r\nsmashed. The vicar, strange to say, escaped without injury, but his wife\r\nand friend were not so fortunate.\r\n\r\nA lamentable catastrophe occurred in February this year in London, when\r\nMr. George Edward Colebrook, an Australian merchant, of St. Mary Axe,\r\nE.C., lost his life. It appeared that on the previous Sunday the\r\ndeceased went for his first motor-car ride with his brother-in-law,\r\naccompanied also by the owner of the car and a professional driver.\r\nThere had been a sharp fall of snow and hail, and the roads were in a\r\nbad state. When attempting to pass at a moderate pace another car in the\r\nFinchley Road, near the Royal Oak at Hendon, the hind wheels skidded.\r\nThe car turned round and ran against a raised footpath and then\r\noverturned. Mr. Colebrook was fatally injured, and died on Tuesday\r\nnight from concussion of the brain, having been unconscious from the\r\ntime of the accident. His brother-in-law received a fractured arm and\r\nother injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL VERDICT\r\n\r\nThus much for the opposition, and the _Advocatus Diaboli_ now resumes\r\nhis seat. His accusations appear formidable; but it might be justly\r\npointed out that if a catalogue were compiled of the serious results\r\ncaused by the shortcomings of the horse, motor-car accidents would be\r\nfound few in comparison. It might be demonstrated that in twelve days 17\r\npersons had been killed and 143 injured in accidents attributable to\r\nthat noble animal.\r\n\r\nWhen the foregoing tram and motor casualties are analysed, it will be\r\nfound that the majority were due to lack of control over the brake\r\npower, to ignorance, or to careless driving.\r\n\r\nAs I have observed before, many evils have been laid to the charge of\r\nelectric traction. Last year it was reported in the papers that a young\r\nwoman had been instantaneously killed at Shepherd’s Bush by the\r\noverhead wires. The fatality was attributed to one of the guide-wires\r\nbreaking at the extreme end (an accident which had really occurred on\r\nthe line), but it had been replaced _before_ the young lady fell down in\r\nthe road, and it was proved at the inquest that she died in the normal\r\nway of heart disease.\r\n\r\nIn the old coaching days the dire forebodings of evil arising from\r\ntravelling by steam were much more comprehensive than those of the\r\npresent day from electric travelling. Horse-breeding, it was said, would\r\ncease and farmers become ruined, their crops perhaps destroyed by\r\nsparks from passing engines; human beings would be asphyxiated while\r\nrushing through the air at tremendous speeds; high roads would fall to\r\nrack and ruin; and every innkeeper on coach routes would be bankrupted!\r\nIn fact, a lamentable social revolution was bound to be brought about by\r\nStephenson’s pestilential proposals!\r\n\r\nOf electrical traction, its greatest detractors can only urge--and with\r\ntruth--that it is not yet without drawbacks, not yet so perfected as\r\nto render accidents impossible. And the _Advocatus Diaboli_, after due\r\nconsideration of his own arguments, generously acknowledges that he has\r\nfailed to make out his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_ELECTRIC LOCOMOTION AND OUR NATIONAL LIFE_\r\n\r\n    “Long sleeps the summer in the seed;\r\n     Run out your measured arcs, and lead\r\n     The closing cycle rich in good.”--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IT AFFECTS EXISTING RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nThomas Alva Edison is reported to have said, “Electricity will displace\r\nsteam,” and, taking his prediction as a text, I will begin by quoting a\r\nfew figures; for Britishers, though they may affect otherwise, dearly\r\nlove statistics.\r\n\r\nWell, in the year that Queen Victoria ascended the throne the capital\r\ninvested in railways might have been expressed in a few figures. When\r\nshe died, the “iron horse” represented the vast sum of twelve hundred\r\nmillions sterling.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago investments in electric traction enterprises amounted\r\nto not more than £100,000. To-day they involve immense sums, the County\r\nCouncil’s scheme for London alone running up to £50,000,000! But this is\r\nnothing to the probabilities of the near future, as Mr. Percy Sellon\r\npointed out to the London Chamber of Commerce. “Within the next ten\r\nyears,” he said, “electric supply and traction may be expected, with a\r\nfair field, to engage at least 250 millions of capital”; and this\r\nestimate seems to be by no means exaggerated; in fact, it is\r\nunderrated. As one of the leading “dailies” observes, “Apart from such a\r\nlarge project as the electrification of the District and Metropolitan\r\nRailways, there is scarcely a municipal authority in Great Britain which\r\nhas not in hand some scheme of electric railway, tramway, or lighting.\r\nIt is as well to think that electricity is not the agent of the future,\r\nbut of the present, and an era which has already dawned. In displacement\r\nof steam, electricity is evidently destined to be one of the products of\r\nthe first quarter of the twentieth century.”\r\n\r\nIt may be surmised that by the time Mr. Sellons ten years have expired\r\nall the great railway companies in the kingdom will have adopted\r\nelectricity as motive power, certainly on their suburban lines, and for\r\nthe passenger traffic on the main lines.\r\n\r\nWith what effect, and at what cost?\r\n\r\nThe latter question can hardly be answered, but the former may be\r\nguessed at. For a long time the railway companies will naturally be\r\nreluctant to bring about such a revolution as the substitution of\r\nelectricity for steam. Engines of enormous power, such as the new Great\r\nEastern “Decapod” or ten-wheeler, will be requisitioned to accelerate\r\nthe working of trains; and, to save fuel, petroleum will be extensively\r\nadopted on others.\r\n\r\nBut electricity the public will have, if it is shown to be more\r\neconomical in the long run.\r\n\r\nStill, to entirely dispense with a great stock of costly locomotives,\r\nsubstituting up-to-date motor engines--with the possibility looming in\r\nthe future that these, too, in their turn, by the perfecting of storage\r\nbatteries, may be displaced--to, perhaps, build new cars, or completely\r\nremodel existing rolling-stock; to erect new buildings (in many cases)\r\nfor power stations; to lay down third rails; all this would involve an\r\nexpenditure that even long-suffering shareholders would rebel against.\r\nWhile, if the steam locomotives were retained to work an accelerated\r\ngoods service on separate tracks, the widening of bridges, cuttings, and\r\nviaducts, the duplication of tunnels on many lines, and the enlargement\r\nof stations and sidings, would entail disastrous expenditure. However,\r\nthe change will doubtless be made gradually, perhaps commencing with the\r\nsuburban lines, probably as a direct result of the electrification of\r\nthe Inner Circle Railway, over whose system several main lines have\r\nimportant running powers, and which will then be compelled to abandon\r\nsteam. Or should some enterprising Socialistic Government come into\r\npower with no such trifling matters as Education, Water, Gas, or Tube\r\nBills on its hands, it might by the year 1913, in its anxiety to carry\r\ntheory into practice, decide to nationalise and electrify our railways\r\nwholesale, and at any cost--to the ratepayers!\r\n\r\nThe effect, anyhow, would not be so very startling, for by that time\r\nelectric travelling would be a matter of course, and disused locomotives\r\nof the type so familiar on the “Underground” would be inquired for by\r\nrelic hunters and presented as curios to every big town.\r\n\r\nAlready the change on the great lines has begun, and it is a significant\r\nfact that the North Eastern have decided to adopt electricity on some\r\nthirty-seven miles of their system in the neighbourhood of\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, and a modified form of it in the shape of auto-cars\r\nwith petrol engines and dynamos generating the current, on the short\r\nline between Hartlepool and West Hartlepool.\r\n\r\nOf electric lines in progress or projected, we have the Manchester and\r\nLiverpool, the London and Brighton, the Edinburgh and Glasgow, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn London all the big termini will be linked together, and connected\r\nwith the metropolitan Tube systems, whatever form the latter may\r\nultimately assume. This may have the effect of increasing the crowding\r\nand bustling of our big stations, but, on the other hand, a vast number\r\nof wealthy people will use motor-cars from “house-to-house,” dispensing\r\naltogether with the railway.\r\n\r\nTrains, more speedily and more economically run, will start more\r\nfrequently. Goods traffic will be on entirely separate lines, and\r\npassenger trains will be able to follow one another in rapid and safe\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nExteriorily all the termini will look as they do now, minus the presence\r\nof horsed four-wheelers and hansoms. But Victoria will be greatly\r\nenlarged along Buckingham Palace Road; while Euston, nearly doubled in\r\nsize, will have its frontage brought forward to Euston Square. Within,\r\nthere will be less confusion, as either the American check system of\r\nbooking luggage will be adopted, or that of collecting it beforehand by\r\nthe railway company’s swift motor-vans, and there will be less\r\nsteam. On the whole, however, the old stations will probably be\r\nunchanged--Paddington, with its familiar transept roof, impressive as in\r\n1854, when the late Queen, travelling from Windsor, paid it her first\r\nvisit; the Midland, remarkable for its noble span roof, soaring one\r\nhundred feet above the level of its eleven lines of rail and its four\r\nplatforms; the Great Eastern, the largest terminus in the kingdom, under\r\nfive great spans--four parallel and one transverse--of glazed roofing,\r\nwith its eighteen arrival and departure platforms; and Waterloo, once a\r\nmere shed propped up by arches, but now second in size only to\r\nLiverpool Street, a maze to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nThe large provincial stations will most likely remain much as they are\r\nat present--Bristol, Exeter, York, Glasgow, Liverpool, all splendid\r\nspecimens of important termini and junctions; Swindon, Crewe,\r\nManchester, and Warrington, greatly improved, if not entirely rebuilt.\r\n\r\nPower machinery will be housed in existing railway buildings when\r\npracticable, and intermediate sub-stations will be marked features along\r\nthe railway routes. Pumping-houses, water-tanks, coalyards, stages, and\r\nsidings will have disappeared.\r\n\r\nSleepy wayside stations, with their pleasant gardens and rural\r\nsurroundings, will probably remain untouched by the new order of things,\r\nsave that the rapid delivery of farm produce by horseless vehicles or by\r\nlight railways, acting as feeders, will wake them up.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPROVEMENT OF STREET TRAFFIC\r\n\r\nThe general use of horseless vehicles will do more--at any rate in\r\nLondon--towards the sanitation of great cities than all the enactments\r\nof county or borough councils. Medical experts are agreed that the\r\ncondition of the roads, however well kept, in dry weather particularly,\r\nis highly conducive to the spread of all kinds of throat diseases, not\r\nto mention influenza; while if the roads are neglected, the peril is\r\nincreased and every sense is offended. Horses, as beasts of burden,\r\nshould have no place in crowded thoroughfares, and their presence in\r\nnumbers produces on wood-paving a pernicious and offensive ammoniacal\r\nresult which anyone can test in, say, Broad Street, after the omnibuses\r\nhave ceased running for the day, or, rather, for the night. All over\r\nLondon, and even in the suburbs, the streets are Augean stables, which\r\nno effort of the Hercules of Spring Gardens or the Guildhall can\r\neffectually cleanse. It is estimated that at the present time there are\r\nover 16,000 licensed horse carriages in London, besides tradesmens vans\r\nand other vehicles, and that 200,000 horses are stabled every night,\r\nnecessitating the removal of thousands of tons of manure and refuse\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nNoise, too--that distracting rattle and rumble of vans, light carts,\r\nomnibuses, and cabs--will be done away with, and how much this will help\r\nto restore the nervous system of Londoners who can tell? Horses having\r\nalmost vanished, the space each one would occupy--some seven feet in\r\nlength--will be saved on each vehicle, and thus the increase of traffic\r\nwill be partly provided for. Collisions and the running-down of cars\r\nwill be unheard of, the steering and stopping powers of the electric\r\nmotors being perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS SOCIAL RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe effect of universal electric traction on our social life may be\r\nfar-reaching and prodigious. It may result in a partial decrease in the\r\nresident population of London, the working-classes living largely in the\r\ncountry and travelling up and down at uniform penny fares, clerks and\r\nothers doing the same; while the wealthy and the well-to-do may use\r\ntheir motor-cars to such an extent as to habitually sleep outside the\r\ntown boundaries, as may also members of both Houses. Only those persons\r\nwhose duties compel them, will live within hearing of Big Ben.\r\n\r\nSociety will be still more restless, but its members will be healthier,\r\nas fresh air will readily be obtainable. There will be even less time\r\nfor reading than now. Formal calls will largely cease; friends in\r\nluxurious electro-cars will “pop in” _en route_ on short surprise\r\nvisits, and hospitality will, on the whole, diminish.\r\n\r\nIn these vehicles, touring parties (_without_ Cook and Son, or Gaze and\r\nCo.) will be constantly arranged to traverse the world. House rents\r\ngenerally will be lower, save at the seaside and other health resorts,\r\nwhere they may actually become higher. So that for those who elect to\r\nremain in town, it will be possible to live on a moderate income, rates\r\nand taxes, it is to be hoped, also being lessened.\r\n\r\nThe cost of living will be reduced, produce of all kinds being more\r\nextensively home-grown and more economically brought to market.\r\n\r\nHorses, being discarded for draught purposes, will be plentiful and\r\ncheap; cavalry remounts will be readily obtained, and all over Europe\r\nmounted forces may be the order of the day. The smallest farmer will be\r\nable to employ several horses on his farm, and everyone in the country,\r\ngrown tired of cycling and motoring, will have their stables full at low\r\ncost, while in the season Rotten Row will be more crowded than ever with\r\nequestrians.\r\n\r\nWages will be higher, and there will be a wider field and less\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nLastly, hygienic conditions being vastly improved, and smoke abolished,\r\nthe death-rate of London and all large cities will be reduced. But the\r\ngreatest boon electrical traction can bestow, will be reserved for the\r\nworking and poorer classes. Take London, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT ON OVERCROWDING\r\n\r\n“Overcrowding! Why, everybody knows what that means!” said the Hon. John\r\nMiddlemass. “Only the other day I had to travel to town from\r\nSouthampton, and the first-class compartment actually filled up--a\r\nbeastly nuisance, for we could not play whist as we had hoped. And in\r\nthe afternoon, when on my way to pay a visit at Lancaster Gate, I\r\ncouldn’t get a seat in the Twopenny Tube, but had to stand all the way,\r\nholding on by one of the straps in the roof! Overcrowding! Why, the last\r\ntime I dined at the Gresham Club in the City, there was not a table to\r\nbe got to one’s self. They were all packed, and the waiters could hardly\r\nmove about. And that evening at Lady Danby’s reception in Piccadilly we\r\ncouldn’t even stir, I can assure you, once we were in her big\r\ndrawing-room. While as for supper, it was a fight to get near the\r\nbuffet, and when I did manage to get some consommé for Sybil Clare, who\r\nwas positively starving, just as I was piloting it out of the crush,\r\nsome fool jobbed my elbow, and sent the lot of it right into old Colonel\r\nCurry’s face, and made him swear like a trooper! To make matters worse,\r\nI stepped upon the Dowager Lady Harvey’s train, which had no business on\r\nthe floor at all, and, I am told, tore three breadths out of it,\r\nwhatever that may mean. Anyhow, I was not asked to any of her dinners\r\nagain that season.\r\n\r\n“Overcrowding! Yes! You should have been stopping with me at Rookfort\r\nCastle the Christmas after young Lord Staunton had come of age! Two in\r\neach bedroom, I assure you, and they actually had the cheek to ask some\r\nof us to put up with the box-room at the top of the house, as every\r\nsquare foot of the place was occupied. Oh, yes, I know what trying to\r\nput too many eggs in one basket means! I went through it all on board\r\nthe P. and O. _Arabia_, from Bombay. Six in a cabin; no room to dress,\r\nhad to take it by turns; all the grub served in double relays; baths out\r\nof the question, unless a fellow sat up all night to grab one; and the\r\npromenade-deck like the enclosure at Ascot on Cup Day; which reminds me\r\nthat I never was at any of the big races when the grand stand wasn’t\r\ncrowded out.\r\n\r\n“Then, as to overcrowding in small houses, used I not to call upon poor\r\nBristowe, my chum at Eton, who became a lawyer’s clerk at £300 a year,\r\ngot married, had eleven children, and lives in a poky little house down\r\nFulham way--only eight rooms--and I believe some of them sleep in the\r\nbathroom and the kitchen, and the slavey in the scullery!”\r\n\r\nEvidently the Hon. John did not know much about the social problem of\r\novercrowding amongst the poor, and how it has arisen.\r\n\r\n“It is not good that man should be alone,” and ever since that divine\r\nmaxim was enunciated, man has taken good care to act upon it, in more\r\nsenses than one. His nature is gregarious, and as the world he was sent\r\ninto ceased to give him its fruits spontaneously, he was obliged to take\r\nto a country life to obtain the means of existence by the sweat of his\r\nbrow. He did not readily adapt himself to the new conditions, and, as\r\nthe history of Babel shows, there was always a tendency to congregate,\r\nbuild great cities, and get as much agricultural work done as possible\r\nby slaves.\r\n\r\nNowadays the dislike of solitude is more marked than ever. Who does not\r\nknow of beautiful country vicarages whose inmates would give their souls\r\nto go and live in towns; of farms where wife and daughters pass their\r\ntime in grumbling because it is so dull at the old house; of squatters\r\nfar away in Gipp’s Land or Maneroo Plains, who, as soon as they make\r\ntheir pile, leave the roomy verandahed station, and, importuned by an\r\nimpatient family, settle down at St. Kilda, Toorak, Darling Point, in\r\nMelbourne, or Sydney? Even peasants, country born and bred, seeking to\r\n“better themselves” in Canada, often cannot, or will not, bear the\r\nabsence of such small excitement as falls to their lot in their native\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThis is illustrated by a case known to myself, where a labouring lad,\r\nassisted out to the far West, and there obtaining good wages, and--what\r\nto him was luxury indeed--unlimited eggs to eat, threw up his situation\r\nand came back to his home in Kent and to his wretched wages, simply\r\nbecause, as he said, “It was too lonely in Manitoba; there was no\r\namusement and no village inns.”\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Rider Haggard has remarked, “Some parts of England are becoming\r\nalmost as lonesome as the veldt of Africa.”\r\n\r\nTherefore there is the danger ahead that Goldsmith’s foreboding may be\r\nrealised:--\r\n\r\n    “Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,\r\n     Where wealth accumulates and men decay.\r\n     Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade,\r\n     A breath can make them as a breath has made,\r\n     But a bold peasantry, their country’s pride,\r\n     When once destroyed can never be supplied.”\r\n\r\nHodge, as a class, cannot emigrate. He has muscle, he has a wife and\r\nusually several children, but he has no capital, and the colonies, with\r\nthe exception of Canada, do not encourage him or want him without. His\r\nadvent also means a disturbance in the labour market and lowers the wage\r\nrate. So millions of acres of fertile land in our dependencies where\r\nthere is room, and more than room, for all, remain untilled,\r\ndependencies created by British capital, defended from invasion by\r\nBritish fleets, helped by British taxpayers, but allowed by a succession\r\nof Governments, with the precedent of the American colonies in their\r\nminds, to surround themselves with _chevaux-de-frise_ of exclusiveness.\r\n\r\nNo longer do great clipper ships leave these shores crowded with hopeful\r\nemigrants, the refrain of “Cheer, boys, cheer,” on their lips, and speed\r\nacross wide oceans to the Antipodes. A new order of things prevails.\r\nWorkmen’s wages in Australasia must be maintained at a fixed standard,\r\ncome what may. Heavy duties must be levied to effect this, and\r\neverything must be “protected,” except the interests of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBut Hodge wants to move somewhere and earn more money, so he and his\r\nbelongings migrate to London, side by side with other kinds of\r\nimpoverished labourers; but, alas! for them, side by side also with the\r\npoor alien, who is unquestionably one great cause of the congestion in\r\ncertain districts. Russians, Poles, and Germans swarm into the world’s\r\nmetropolis, whose streets, they have been told, are paved with gold that\r\nonly requires picking up! They are willing to pay almost any price for\r\nwretched accommodation near their work, where they herd together under\r\nconditions as low as they can well be.\r\n\r\nThe following illustrates this. At the London Hospital in December of\r\nlast year Mr. Wynne E. Baxter held an inquest on the body of Mary\r\nMoretsky Libermann, aged nine, who was accidentally burnt to death. The\r\ncoroner said the only articles in the room where the fatality took place\r\nwere a small bed and a broken chair, and that the mother and two\r\nchildren slept in the bed, and four other children on the floor. The\r\nwoman, it appeared, came from Russia, and had only been in England seven\r\nweeks. For the small room she paid 3_s._ 6_d._ a week. A juryman urged\r\nthat there ought to be some sort of supervision over the kind of house\r\nin which this woman and her family existed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. WHERE THE POOR LIVE\r\n\r\nOriginal drawing by Hanslip Fletcher\r\n\r\n_By permission of Mr. Hanslip Fletcher_]\r\n\r\nThe presence of aliens and their competition also lowers the already\r\nsufficiently low rate of wages. Houses, therefore, in these\r\nlocalities--once tenanted by a single family--are let off at exorbitant\r\nrates to as many as can be crammed into them. Lucky, indeed, is the\r\nmarried labourer who can anywhere secure a single room for 4_s._ to\r\n6_s._ a week. And such a room! No means of preparing a real meal, the\r\nfamily fare generally consisting of tea, “two-eyed steaks” (herrings),\r\nand a “couple of doorsteps” (two slices of bread) per head.\r\n\r\nBut, as “General” Booth says, “A home is a home be it ever so low, and\r\nthe desperate tenacity with which the poor cling to the last wretched\r\nsemblance of one is very touching. There are vile dens, fever-haunted\r\nand stenchful crowded courts, where the return of summer is dreaded\r\nbecause it means the unloosing of myriads of vermin which render night\r\nunbearable, which (the dens) nevertheless are regarded as havens of rest\r\nby their hard-working occupants. They can scarcely be said to be\r\nfurnished. A chair, a mattress, and a few miserable sticks constitute\r\nall the furniture of the single room in which they have to sleep and\r\nbreed and die; but they cling to it as a drowning man to a\r\nhalf-submerged raft.... So long as the family has a lair into which it\r\ncan creep at night, the married man keeps his footing, but when he loses\r\nthat solitary foothold, there arrives the time, if there be such a thing\r\nas Christian compassion, for the helping hand to be held out to save him\r\nfrom the vortex that sucks him downward, aye, downward to the hopeless\r\nunder-strata of crime and despair.”\r\n\r\nTruly in such cases one realises the truth of these lines:--\r\n\r\n    “God made the country, and man made the town,\r\n     What wonder then that health and virtue, gifts\r\n     That can alone make sweet the bitter draft\r\n     That life holds out to all, should most abound\r\n     And least be threatened in the fields and groves.”\r\n\r\nBooth writes chiefly of the East of London; but of all overcrowded vile\r\ndens, perhaps none are so bad as those in the West End, frequently not a\r\nstone’s-throw from fashionable thoroughfares and luxurious residences.\r\n\r\nAt Notting Dale, Kensington, is a district comprising five streets,\r\nconsisting entirely of common lodging-houses and “furnished rooms,”\r\nwhose occupants are thieves, rogues, professional beggars, hawkers, and\r\n“unfortunates.” It has been rightly named the “West End Avernus,” and so\r\noffensive are the habits of its unwashed crowds, that the policeman on\r\nhis beat is often compelled to hold his handkerchief to his nose as he\r\npasses by.\r\n\r\nStill lower in the grade of accommodation for a married labourer is the\r\n“part of one room” system; and, lowest of all, the common lodging-house,\r\nwhere over-crowding is inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn one alley in Spitalfields there were last year ten houses in whose\r\nfifty-one rooms (none of them more than 8 ft. by 9 ft.--about the size\r\nof a biggish bathroom) no fewer than 254 human beings were distributed;\r\nfrom two to nine in each apartment, but nine in the room was not the\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\nThere is an old story to the effect that a district visitor,\r\nsympathising with an occupant of some such lodging as the above in St.\r\nGiles’-in-the-Fields, where four families respectively _tenanted_ the\r\nfour corners, was met with the philosophic reply, “Oh, yes, we should\r\nhave been comfortable enough if the landlord hadn’t gone and let the\r\nmiddle of the room to a fifth family.”\r\n\r\nThink of all this, fathers and mothers, who jealously guard your\r\nchildren from every possible source of moral contamination, whose\r\ndaughters’ modesty would be startled if accidentally a bedroom window\r\nmomentarily revealed their toilettes, whose children at boarding-schools\r\nfeel sensitive about dressing and undressing before others.\r\n\r\nYet this is nothing! A well-known rector in the East End says: “From\r\none of my parochial buildings I have seen through the thinly-veiled\r\nwindows of a house, four men and six women retiring for the night in one\r\nroom, all of them respectable, hard-working people, and the majority of\r\nthem sleeping in beds on the floor,” the rent per week being eight\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\nAs to the alleged dislike of the very poor to the use of soap and water,\r\nit is chiefly because the privacy essential for tubbing is simply\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nProbably the lowest depth is attained, as I have said, in the common\r\nlodging-house, where all kinds of characters assemble under conditions\r\nwhich make innocence and decency impossible, children looking without\r\nany emotion upon sights they ought never to see, and listening to\r\nlanguage they ought never to hear.\r\n\r\nThe victims of this result of overcrowding are human beings like\r\nourselves, “fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject\r\nto the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the\r\nsame winter and summer.”\r\n\r\nIt is not from choice that men, women, and children are thus herded\r\nworse than cattle. Necessity compels them to dwell within a certain\r\narea, especially the “docker,” who cannot afford to take a journey in\r\nsearch of work, while the smallness and uncertainty of their earnings,\r\ntogether with the high rent they pay, deprive them of the power to exist\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nFigures prove little, but it is a fact that for all London the average\r\npopulation per acre is fifty-seven; and an idea of the extent of\r\novercrowding in certain localities may be gathered by comparing this\r\nwith that of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, which is 210; with\r\nWhitechapel, 225; and with Spitalfields, 330; the latter equivalent to\r\ncrowding into the area of Grosvenor Square (six acres), tenements\r\ncontaining 1,980 souls, instead of 342! On the other hand, in the\r\nwealthy parts of London there is far too much room, great mansions that\r\ncould comfortably accommodate scores of people being habitually left\r\nalmost empty.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of it all is terrible. Thousands of infants, ill-born,\r\ntainted, ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, are growing up under\r\nconditions where purity of thought is impossible, growing up to taint\r\nfuture generations and undo the good work effected elsewhere in social\r\nregeneration. Why keep the main stream pure if foul rivulets be allowed\r\nto arise and pollute it again? Why make clean the outside only of the\r\ncup and platter?\r\n\r\nBut, as Cervantes says, “there is a remedy for everything but death.”\r\nAnd for the “submerged tenth,” who cannot move away to the suburbs, no\r\ndoubt in time vast barracks built of steel with garden roofs, unsightly\r\nbut utilitarian, will be created in every poor quarter, resembling the\r\nPark Row Buildings in New York, 380 feet in height, and consisting of\r\nthirty stories; or the Fisher, the Marquette, and the Champlain blocks\r\nin Chicago, of seventeen stories each.\r\n\r\nThese buildings would accommodate thousands of lodgers--British subjects\r\nonly--at low rentals, under decent and sanitary conditions. While for\r\nworkmen and others in receipt of fair wages cheap electric traction,\r\nenabling them to go to and from their daily task, will solve the problem\r\nof overcrowding so far as they are concerned.\r\n\r\nOvercrowding, however, is only one out of a host of problems and\r\nquestions that characterised the closing decades of the last century,\r\nand beset the opening of the present one.\r\n\r\nWe are haunted with problems, and if none existed we should probably\r\nregret it, and try to invent them. There are endless political and\r\neconomic problems, the naval and military, the religious and\r\neducational, the national food supply, and with it the land and\r\nagricultural question, the labour question, and the relief of the poor,\r\nwho are always with us.\r\n\r\nSocial problems bristle on all sides, and every active lady appears to\r\nbelong, not to one, but to many of the societies for the reform or\r\nabolition of this, and for the bringing about of that, which abound. Mr.\r\nJellyby’s little project for civilising the natives of Borrioboola-Gha\r\non the left bank of the Niger, and providing them with blankets, would\r\nbe but a drop in the philanthropic ocean of to-day!\r\n\r\nTemperance, morality, smoking, marriage laws, vaccination, funeral\r\ncustoms and cremation, early closing, domestic service, cooking, dress,\r\nhygiene, our boys and girls and what to do with them, in fact,\r\neverything in life, seems to have been converted into a “Question,” and\r\nprovides a text upon which more or less eloquent sermons are preached.\r\n\r\nEveryone seems to work hard, and has no time for anything. Everyone,\r\ntoo, is restless and expectant, eager for excitement and change, while\r\nmiracles of discovery and invention are wrought so frequently as to be\r\nalmost unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAll nations are being chained together by iron roads or lines of swift\r\nsteamers, and everybody travels. Locomotion is the order of the day, a\r\nsign of the times, and electricity is the great factor that has brought\r\nit about.\r\n\r\nJust as in the building of some vast cathedral unsightly scaffolding\r\nconceals the graceful proportions of the uprising building, so in what\r\nis going on around us may appear much confusion and absence of purpose.\r\nBut out of it is being evolved a state of readiness for the coming era,\r\nwhen wars shall cease and vexed problems be finally solved.\r\n\r\nMeantime the world’s feverish workers might well despair, were it not\r\nthat they\r\n\r\n                    “...see in part\r\n    That all, as in some piece of art,\r\n    Is toil co-operant to an end.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidents on electric railways, 251-256\r\n\r\n--

It is of beam type, and the oak beam was only\r\n replaced at the end of last year by one of iron. In 1812 a new\r\n cylinder was put in, but the rest of the engine remains as it was 136\r\n years ago, even to the connecting-rod for rolling-mill purposes. It\r\n is said that this G.O.M. is more economical than many of the modern\r\n engines used in the trade.\r\n\r\n [2] The biggest and most powerful locomotive in the world is stated to\r\n be the “Bessemer,” built in 1900 at the Pittsburg Locomotive Works,\r\n U.S.A., weighing with its tender 175 tons. Its height is 16 feet from\r\n rail to top of smoke-stack, and it is capable of easily drawing a\r\n train of 4,000 tons at 25 miles an hour, or 8,000 tons at 15 miles\r\n an hour. Its hauling power is therefore enormous, and so it ought to\r\n be, as the diameter of the smallest ring of the boiler is 7 feet 10\r\n inches. The nearest approach in size to this monster was constructed\r\n in Great Britain for the Santa Fé Railway in Argentina, and weighed\r\n 150 tons.\r\n\r\n [3] See Chapter I.\r\n\r\n [4] These have since given place to motor-cars built in America.\r\n\r\n [5] Report of Parliamentary Committee on Housing of the Poor, 1902.\r\n\r\n [6] _vide_ Chapter V.\r\n\r\n [7] One of the largest tramway schemes ever promoted is contained\r\n in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Bill, which came\r\n before Parliament in March last. The routes have a total length of\r\n 80 miles, and pass through a district with a population of close\r\n upon three-quarters of a million. The idea is to connect, by means\r\n of electric tramways, the towns of Nottingham, Long Eaton, Derby,\r\n Ilkeston, Ripley, Alfreton, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Pleasley, Mansfield,\r\n Eastwood, Bulwell, and Hucknall Torkard.\r\n\r\n [8] In England the motor-car is beginning to play an important part\r\n in country parliamentary elections. Motor-cars are used by commercial\r\n travellers, and are being tried for the official work of the police\r\n about the metropolis. The General Post Office is also giving motor\r\n carriers a trial for letters and parcels; and motors are utilised for\r\n dust-carts.\r\n\r\n [9] A very curious and, to the superstitious, significant coincidence\r\n was recently reported from Ireland.\r\n\r\n Last year, when permission was asked to repair the road between\r\n Newcastle and Kilcoole, a member of the rural council opposed,\r\n declaring that it was good enough for farmers, and they did not want\r\n to encourage “galoots in motor-cars” and “go-boys on bicycles” in\r\n their neighbourhood. This councillor was, not long since, killed\r\n through the wheel of his cart catching in one of the ruts complained\r\n of!\r\n\r\n [10] Both Brunel and Scott Russell, the eminent shipbuilder, argued\r\n that from scientific theory and actual experience there need be no\r\n limit to the size of a ship when constructed on the tubular principle,\r\n except that which the quality of the material imposed.\r\n\r\n [11] The Hamburg-American Line’s luxurious yacht _Prinzessin Victoria\r\n Luise_ has a splendidly-equipped gymnasium, where the passengers can\r\n indulge in horse-riding, cycling, and rowing, on the various apparatus\r\n installed. On one of the decks is a first-class “cricket-pitch,” a\r\n tennis-court, and an archery ground.\r\n\r\n [12] A heater devised by Mr. E. G. Rivers, chief electrical engineer\r\n to the Office of Works, brings the problem of electric heating for\r\n domestic purposes well within the bounds of practical utility. It\r\n renders possible the employment of electricity for heating buildings,\r\n for cooking, and for other uses in a manner hitherto impossible. Mr.\r\n Rivers is engaged in developing his invention in the direction of\r\n applying it to cooking-ranges, and expects very shortly to adapt it to\r\n that use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:\r\n\r\nsafeguard against breaksdown=> safeguard against breakdowns {pg 8}\r\n\r\nMotor tricycles and bicylces=> Motor tricycles and bicycles {pg 205}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Tube, Train, Tram, and Car, by Arthur H.
