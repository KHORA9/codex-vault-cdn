During many years I collected\r\nnotes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of\r\npublishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to\r\npublish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices\r\nagainst my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first\r\nedition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work \"light would be\r\nthrown on the origin of man and his history;\" and this implies that man\r\nmust be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion\r\nrespecting his manner of appearance on this earth. Now the case wears a\r\nwholly different aspect. When a naturalist like Carl Vogt ventures to\r\nsay in his address as President of the National Institution of Geneva\r\n(1869), \"personne, en Europe au moins, n'ose plus soutenir la creation\r\nindependante et de toutes pieces, des especes,\" it is manifest that at\r\nleast a large number of naturalists must admit that species are the\r\nmodified descendants of other species; and this especially holds good\r\nwith the younger and rising naturalists. The greater number accept the\r\nagency of natural selection; though some urge, whether with justice the\r\nfuture must decide, that I have greatly overrated its importance. Of the\r\nolder and honoured chiefs in natural science, many unfortunately are\r\nstill opposed to evolution in every form.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the views now adopted by most naturalists, and which\r\nwill ultimately, as in every other case, be followed by other men, I\r\nhave been led to put together my notes, so as to see how far the general\r\nconclusions arrived at in my former works were applicable to man. This\r\nseemed all the more desirable as I had never deliberately applied these\r\nviews to a species taken singly. When we confine our attention to any\r\none form, we are deprived of the weighty arguments derived from the\r\nnature of the affinities which connect together whole groups of\r\norganisms--their geographical distribution in past and present times,\r\nand their geological succession. The homological structure,\r\nembryological development, and rudimentary organs of a species, whether\r\nit be man or any other animal, to which our attention may be directed,\r\nremain to be considered; but these great classes of facts afford, as it\r\nappears to me, ample and conclusive evidence in favour of the principle\r\nof gradual evolution. The strong support derived from the other\r\narguments should, however, always be kept before the mind.\r\n\r\nThe sole object of this work is to consider, firstly, whether man, like\r\nevery other species, is descended from some pre-existing form; secondly,\r\nthe manner of his development; and thirdly, the value of the\r\ndifferences between the so-called races of man. As I shall confine\r\nmyself to these points, it will not be necessary to describe in detail\r\nthe differences between the several races--an enormous subject which has\r\nbeen fully discussed in many valuable works. The high antiquity of man\r\nhas recently been demonstrated by the labours of a host of eminent men,\r\nbeginning with M. Boucher de Perthes; and this is the indispensable\r\nbasis for understanding his origin. I shall, therefore, take this\r\nconclusion for granted, and may refer my readers to the admirable\r\ntreatises of Sir Charles Lyell, Sir John Lubbock, and others. Nor shall\r\nI have occasion to do more than to allude to the amount of difference\r\nbetween man and the anthropomorphous apes; for Prof. Huxley, in the\r\nopinion of most competent judges, has conclusively shewn that in every\r\nsingle visible character man differs less from the higher apes than\r\nthese do from the lower members of the same order of Primates.\r\n\r\nThis work contains hardly any original facts in regard to man; but as\r\nthe conclusions at which I arrived, after drawing up a rough draft,\r\nappeared to me interesting, I thought that they might interest others.\r\nIt has often and confidently been asserted, that man's origin can never\r\nbe known: but ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does\r\nknowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who\r\nso positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by\r\nscience. The conclusion that man is the co-descendant with other species\r\nof some ancient, lower, and extinct form, is not in any degree new.\r\nLamarck long ago came to this conclusion, which has lately been\r\nmaintained by several eminent naturalists and philosophers; for instance\r\nby Wallace, Huxley, Lyell, Vogt, Lubbock, Buechner, Rolle, &c.,[1] and\r\nespecially by Haeckel. This last naturalist, besides his great work,\r\n'Generelle Morphologie' (1866), has recently (1868, with a second edit.\r\nin 1870), published his 'Natuerliche Schoepfungsgeschichte,' in which he\r\nfully discusses the genealogy of man. If this work had appeared before\r\nmy essay had been written, I should probably never have completed it.\r\nAlmost all the conclusions at which I have arrived I find confirmed by\r\nthis naturalist, whose knowledge on many points is much fuller than\r\nmine. Wherever I have added any fact or view from Prof. Haeckel's\r\nwritings, I give his authority in the text, other statements I leave as\r\nthey originally stood in my manuscript, occasionally giving in the\r\nfoot-notes references to his works, as a confirmation of the more\r\ndoubtful or interesting points.\r\n\r\nDuring many years it has seemed to me highly probable that sexual\r\nselection has played an important part in differentiating the races of\r\nman; but in my 'Origin of Species' (first edition, p. 199) I contented\r\nmyself by merely alluding to this belief. When I came to apply this view\r\nto man, I found it indispensable to treat the whole subject in full\r\ndetail.[2] Consequently the second part of the present work, treating of\r\nsexual selection, has extended to an inordinate length, compared with\r\nthe first part; but this could not be avoided.\r\n\r\nI had intended adding to the present volumes an essay on the expression\r\nof the various emotions by man and the lower animals. My attention was\r\ncalled to this subject many years ago by Sir Charles Bell's admirable\r\nwork. This illustrious anatomist maintains that man is endowed with\r\ncertain muscles solely for the sake of expressing his emotions. As this\r\nview is obviously opposed to the belief that man is descended from some\r\nother and lower form, it was necessary for me to consider it. I likewise\r\nwished to ascertain how far the emotions are expressed in the same\r\nmanner by the different races of man. But owing to the length of the\r\npresent work, I have thought it better to reserve my essay, which is\r\npartially completed, for separate publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT OR ORIGIN OF MAN.\r\n\r\nPART I.--THE DESCENT OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE EVIDENCE OF THE DESCENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nature of the evidence bearing on the origin of man--Homologous\r\n  structures in man and the lower animals--Miscellaneous points\r\n  of correspondence--Development--Rudimentary structures,\r\n  muscles, sense-organs, hair, bones, reproductive organs,\r\n  &c.--The bearing of these three great classes of facts on the\r\n  origin of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who wishes to decide whether man is the modified descendant of some\r\npre-existing form, would probably first enquire whether man varies,\r\nhowever slightly, in bodily structure and in mental faculties; and if\r\nso, whether the variations are transmitted to his offspring in\r\naccordance with the laws which prevail with the lower animals; such as\r\nthat of the transmission of characters to the same age or sex. Again,\r\nare the variations the result, as far as our ignorance permits us to\r\njudge, of the same general causes, and are they governed by the same\r\ngeneral laws, as in the case of other organisms; for instance by\r\ncorrelation, the inherited effects of use and disuse, &c.? Is man\r\nsubject to similar malconformations, the result of arrested development,\r\nof reduplication of parts, &c., and does he display in any of his\r\nanomalies reversion to some former and ancient type of structure? It\r\nmight also naturally be enquired whether man, like so many other\r\nanimals, has given rise to varieties and sub-races, differing but\r\nslightly from each other, or to races differing so much that they must\r\nbe classed as doubtful species? How are such races distributed over the\r\nworld; and how, when crossed, do they react on each other, both in the\r\nfirst and succeeding generations? And so with many other points.\r\n\r\nThe enquirer would next come to the important point, whether man tends\r\nto increase at so rapid a rate, as to lead to occasional severe\r\nstruggles for existence, and consequently to beneficial variations,\r\nwhether in body or mind, being preserved, and injurious ones eliminated.\r\nDo the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach\r\non and replace each other, so that some finally become extinct? We shall\r\nsee that all these questions, as indeed is obvious in respect to most of\r\nthem, must be answered in the affirmative, in the same manner as with\r\nthe lower animals. But the several considerations just referred to may\r\nbe conveniently deferred for a time; and we will first see how far the\r\nbodily structure of man shows traces, more or less plain, of his descent\r\nfrom some lower form. In the two succeeding chapters the mental powers\r\nof man, in comparison with those of the lower animals, will be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bodily Structure of Man._--It is notorious that man is constructed\r\non the same general type or model with other mammals. All the bones in\r\nhis skeleton can be compared with corresponding bones in a monkey, bat,\r\nor seal. So it is with his muscles, nerves, blood-vessels and internal\r\nviscera. The brain, the most important of all the organs, follows the\r\nsame law, as shewn by Huxley and other anatomists. Bischoff,[3] who is a\r\nhostile witness, admits that every chief fissure and fold in the brain\r\nof man has its analogy in that of the orang; but he adds that at no\r\nperiod of development do their brains perfectly agree; nor could this be\r\nexpected, for otherwise their mental powers would have been the same.\r\nVulpian[4] remarks: \"Les differences reelles qui existent entre\r\nl'encephale de l'homme et celui des singes superieurs, sont bien\r\nminimes. Il ne faut pas se faire d'illusions a cet egard. L'homme est\r\nbien plus pres des singes anthropomorphes par les caracteres anatomiques\r\nde son cerveau que ceux-ci ne le sont non-seulement des autres\r\nmammiferes, mais memes de certains quadrumanes, des guenons et des\r\nmacaques.\" But it would be superfluous here to give further details on\r\nthe correspondence between man and the higher mammals in the structure\r\nof the brain and all other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be worth while to specify a few points, not directly or\r\nobviously connected with structure, by which this correspondence or\r\nrelationship is well shewn.\r\n\r\nMan is liable to receive from the lower animals, and to communicate to\r\nthem, certain diseases as hydrophobia, variola, the glanders, &c.; and\r\nthis fact proves the close similarity of their tissues and blood, both\r\nin minute structure and composition, far more plainly than does their\r\ncomparison under the best microscope, or by the aid of the best chemical\r\nanalysis. Monkeys are liable to many of the same non-contagious diseases\r\nas we are; thus Rengger,[5] who carefully observed for a long time the\r\n_Cebus Azarae_ in its native land, found it liable to catarrh, with the\r\nusual symptoms, and which when often recurrent led to consumption.\r\nThese monkeys suffered also from apoplexy, inflammation of the bowels,\r\nand cataract in the eye. The younger ones when shedding their milk-teeth\r\noften died from fever. Medicines produced the same effect on them as on\r\nus. Many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for tea, coffee, and\r\nspirituous liquors: they will also, as I have myself seen, smoke tobacco\r\nwith pleasure. Brehm asserts that the natives of north-eastern Africa\r\ncatch the wild baboons by exposing vessels with strong beer, by which\r\nthey are made drunk. He has seen some of these animals, which he kept in\r\nconfinement, in this state; and he gives a laughable account of their\r\nbehaviour and strange grimaces. On the following morning they were very\r\ncross and dismal; they held their aching heads with both hands and wore\r\na most pitiable expression: when beer or wine was offered them, they\r\nturned away with disgust, but relished the juice of lemons.[6] An\r\nAmerican monkey, an Ateles, after getting drunk on brandy, would never\r\ntouch it again, and thus was wiser than many men. These trifling facts\r\nprove how similar the nerves of taste must be in monkeys and man, and\r\nhow similarly their whole nervous system is affected.\r\n\r\nMan is infested with internal parasites, sometimes causing fatal\r\neffects, and is plagued by external parasites, all of which belong to\r\nthe same genera or families with those infesting other mammals. Man is\r\nsubject like other mammals, birds, and even insects, to that mysterious\r\nlaw, which causes certain normal processes, such as gestation, as well\r\nas the maturation and duration of various diseases, to follow lunar\r\nperiods.[7] His wounds are repaired by the same process of healing; and\r\nthe stumps left after the amputation of his limbs occasionally possess,\r\nespecially during an early embryonic period, some power of regeneration,\r\nas in the lowest animals.[8]\r\n\r\nThe whole process of that most important function, the reproduction of\r\nthe species, is strikingly the same in all mammals, from the first act\r\nof courtship by the male[9] to the birth and nurturing of the young.\r\nMonkeys are born in almost as helpless a condition as our own infants;\r\nand in certain genera the young differ fully as much in appearance from\r\nthe adults, as do our children from their full-grown parents.[10] It has\r\nbeen urged by some writers as an important distinction, that with man\r\nthe young arrive at maturity at a much later age than with any other\r\nanimal; but if we look to the races of mankind which inhabit tropical\r\ncountries the difference is not great, for the orang is believed not to\r\nbe adult till the age of from ten to fifteen years.[11] Man differs\r\nfrom woman in size, bodily strength, hairyness, &c., as well as in mind,\r\nin the same manner as do the two sexes of many mammals. It is, in short,\r\nscarcely possible to exaggerate the close correspondence in general\r\nstructure, in the minute structure of the tissues, in chemical\r\ncomposition and in constitution, between man and the higher animals,\r\nespecially the anthropomorphous apes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Embryonic Development._--Man is developed from an ovule, about the\r\n125th of an inch in diameter, which differs in no respect from the\r\novules of other animals. The embryo itself at a very early period can\r\nhardly be distinguished from that of other members of the vertebrate\r\nkingdom. At this period the arteries run in arch-like branches, as if to\r\ncarry the blood to branchiae which are not present in the higher\r\nvertebrata, though the slits on the sides of the neck still remain (_f_,\r\n_g_, fig. 1), marking their former position. At a somewhat later period,\r\nwhen the extremities are developed, \"the feet of lizards and mammals,\"\r\nas the illustrious Von Baer remarks, \"the wings and feet of birds, no\r\nless than the hands and feet of man, all arise from the same fundamental\r\nform.\" It is, says Prof. Huxley,[12] \"quite in the later stages of\r\ndevelopment that the young human being presents marked differences from\r\nthe young ape, while the latter departs as much from the dog in its\r\ndevelopments, as the man does. Startling as this last assertion may\r\nappear to be, it is demonstrably true.\"\r\n\r\nAs some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I have\r\ngiven one of man and another of a dog, at about the same early stage of\r\ndevelopment, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy.[13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.

Tail or os coccyx.]\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing statements made by such high authorities, it would\r\nbe superfluous on my part to give a number of borrowed details, shewing\r\nthat the embryo of man closely resembles that of other mammals. It may,\r\nhowever, be added that the human embryo likewise resembles in various\r\npoints of structure certain low forms when adult. For instance, the\r\nheart at first exists as a simple pulsating vessel; the excreta are\r\nvoided through a cloacal passage; and the os coccyx projects like a true\r\ntail, \"extending considerably beyond the rudimentary legs.\"[14] In the\r\nembryos of all air-breathing vertebrates, certain glands called the\r\ncorpora Wolffiana, correspond with and act like the kidneys of mature\r\nfishes.[15] Even at a later embryonic period, some striking resemblances\r\nbetween man and the lower animals may be observed. Bischoff says that\r\nthe convolutions of the brain in a human foetus at the end of the\r\nseventh month reach about the same stage of development as in a baboon\r\nwhen adult.[16] The great toe, as Prof. Owen remarks,[17] \"which forms\r\nthe fulcrum when standing or walking, is perhaps the most\r\ncharacteristic peculiarity in the human structure;\" but in an embryo,\r\nabout an inch in length, Prof. Wyman[18] found \"that the great toe was\r\nshorter than the others, and, instead of being parallel to them,\r\nprojected at an angle from the side of the foot, thus corresponding with\r\nthe permanent condition of this part in the quadrumana.\" I will conclude\r\nwith a quotation from Huxley,[19] who after asking, does man originate\r\nin a different way from a dog, bird, frog or fish? says, \"the reply is\r\nnot doubtful for a moment; without question, the mode of origin and the\r\nearly stages of the development of man are identical with those of the\r\nanimals immediately below him in the scale: without a doubt in these\r\nrespects, he is far nearer to apes, than the apes are to the dog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rudiments._--This subject, though not intrinsically more important than\r\nthe two last, will for several reasons be here treated with more\r\nfullness.[20] Not one of the higher animals can be named which does not\r\nbear some part in a rudimentary condition; and man forms no exception to\r\nthe rule. Rudimentary organs must be distinguished from those that are\r\nnascent; though in some cases the distinction is not easy. The former\r\nare either absolutely useless, such as the mammae of male quadrupeds, or\r\nthe incisor teeth of ruminants which never cut through the gums; or they\r\nare of such slight service to their present possessors, that we cannot\r\nsuppose that they were developed under the conditions which now exist.\r\nOrgans in this latter state are not strictly rudimentary, but they are\r\ntending in this direction. Nascent organs, on the other hand, though not\r\nfully developed, are of high service to their possessors, and are\r\ncapable of further development. Rudimentary organs are eminently\r\nvariable; and this is partly intelligible, as they are useless or nearly\r\nuseless, and consequently are no longer subjected to natural selection.\r\nThey often become wholly suppressed. When this occurs, they are\r\nnevertheless liable to occasional reappearance through reversion; and\r\nthis is a circumstance well worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nDisuse at that period of life, when an organ is chiefly used, and this\r\nis generally during maturity, together with inheritance at a\r\ncorresponding period of life, seem to have been the chief agents in\r\ncausing organs to become rudimentary. The term \"disuse\" does not relate\r\nmerely to the lessened action of muscles, but includes a diminished flow\r\nof blood to a part or organ, from being subjected to fewer alternations\r\nof pressure, or from becoming in any way less habitually active.\r\nRudiments, however, may occur in one sex of parts normally present in\r\nthe other sex; and such rudiments, as we shall hereafter see, have often\r\noriginated in a distinct manner. In some cases organs have been reduced\r\nby means of natural selection, from having become injurious to the\r\nspecies under changed habits of life. The process of reduction is\r\nprobably often aided through the two principles of compensation and\r\neconomy of growth; but the later stages of reduction, after disuse has\r\ndone all that can fairly be attributed to it, and when the saving to be\r\neffected by the economy of growth would be very small,[21] are difficult\r\nto understand. The final and complete suppression of a part, already\r\nuseless and much reduced in size, in which case neither compensation nor\r\neconomy can come into play, is perhaps intelligible by the aid of the\r\nhypothesis of pangenesis, and apparently in no other way. But as the\r\nwhole subject of rudimentary organs has been fully discussed and\r\nillustrated in my former works,[22] I need here say no more on this\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nRudiments of various muscles have been observed in many parts of the\r\nhuman body;[23] and not a few muscles, which are regularly present in\r\nsome of the lower animals can occasionally be detected in man in a\r\ngreatly reduced condition. Every one must have noticed the power which\r\nmany animals, especially horses, possess of moving or twitching their\r\nskin; and this is effected by the panniculus carnosus. Remnants of this\r\nmuscle in an efficient state are found in various parts of our bodies;\r\nfor instance, on the forehead, by which the eyebrows are raised. The\r\n_platysma myoides_, which is well developed on the neck, belongs to this\r\nsystem, but cannot be voluntarily brought into action. Prof. Turner, of\r\nEdinburgh, has occasionally detected, as he informs me, muscular\r\nfasciculi in five different situations, namely in the axillae, near the\r\nscapulae, &c., all of which must be referred to the system of the\r\npanniculus. He has also shewn[24] that the _musculus sternalis_ or\r\n_sternalis brutorum_, which is not an extension of the _rectus\r\nabdominalis_, but is closely allied to the panniculus, occurred in the\r\nproportion of about 3 per cent. in upwards of 600 bodies: he adds, that\r\nthis muscle affords \"an excellent illustration of the statement that\r\noccasional and rudimentary structures are especially liable to variation\r\nin arrangement.\"\r\n\r\nSome few persons have the power of contracting the superficial muscles\r\non their scalps; and these muscles are in a variable and partially\r\nrudimentary condition. M. A. de Candolle has communicated to me a\r\ncurious instance of the long-continued persistence or inheritance of\r\nthis power, as well as of its unusual development. He knows a family, in\r\nwhich one member, the present head of a family, could, when a youth,\r\npitch several heavy books from his head by the movement of the scalp\r\nalone; and he won wagers by performing this feat. His father, uncle,\r\ngrandfather, and all his three children possess the same power to the\r\nsame unusual degree. This family became divided eight generations ago\r\ninto two branches; so that the head of the above-mentioned branch is\r\ncousin in the seventh degree to the head of the other branch. This\r\ndistant cousin resides in another part of France, and on being asked\r\nwhether he possessed the same faculty, immediately exhibited his power.\r\nThis case offers a good illustration how persistently an absolutely\r\nuseless faculty may be transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe extrinsic muscles which serve to move the whole external ear, and\r\nthe intrinsic muscles which move the different parts, all of which\r\nbelong to the system of the panniculus, are in a rudimentary condition\r\nin man; they are also variable in development, or at least in function.\r\nI have seen one man who could draw his ears forwards, and another who\r\ncould draw them backwards;[25] and from what one of these persons told\r\nme, it is probable that most of us by often touching our ears and thus\r\ndirecting our attention towards them, could by repeated trials recover\r\nsome power of movement. The faculty of erecting the ears and of\r\ndirecting them to different points of the compass, is no doubt of the\r\nhighest service to many animals, as they thus perceive the point of\r\ndanger; but I have never heard of a man who possessed the least power of\r\nerecting his ears,--the one movement which might be of use to him. The\r\nwhole external shell of the ear may be considered a rudiment, together\r\nwith the various folds and prominences (helix and anti-helix, tragus and\r\nanti-tragus, &c.) which in the lower animals strengthen and support the\r\near when erect, without adding much to its weight. Some authors,\r\nhowever, suppose that the cartilage of the shell serves to transmit\r\nvibrations to the acoustic nerve; but Mr. Toynbee,[26] after collecting\r\nall the known evidence on this head, concludes that the external shell\r\nis of no distinct use. The ears of the chimpanzee and orang are\r\ncuriously like those of man, and I am assured by the keepers in the\r\nZoological Gardens that these animals never move or erect them; so that\r\nthey are in an equally rudimentary condition, as far as function is\r\nconcerned, as in man. Why these animals, as well as the progenitors of\r\nman, should have lost the power of erecting their ears we cannot say. It\r\nmay be, though I am not quite satisfied with this view, that owing to\r\ntheir arboreal habits and great strength they were but little exposed to\r\ndanger, and so during a lengthened period moved their ears but little,\r\nand thus gradually lost the power of moving them. This would be a\r\nparallel case with that of those large and heavy birds, which from\r\ninhabiting oceanic islands have not been exposed to the attacks of\r\nbeasts of prey, and have consequently lost the power of using their\r\nwings for flight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Human Ear, modelled and drawn by Mr. Woolner.\r\n\r\n_a._ The projecting point.]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated sculptor, Mr. Woolner, informs me of one little\r\npeculiarity in the external ear, which he has often observed both in men\r\nand women, and of which he perceived the full signification. His\r\nattention was first called to the subject whilst at work on his figure\r\nof Puck, to which he had given pointed ears. He was thus led to examine\r\nthe ears of various monkeys, and subsequently more carefully those of\r\nman. The peculiarity consists in a little blunt point, projecting from\r\nthe inwardly folded margin, or helix. Mr. Woolner made an exact model of\r\none such case, and has sent me the accompanying drawing. (Fig. 2.) These\r\npoints not only project inwards, but often a little outwards, so that\r\nthey are visible when the head is viewed from directly in front or\r\nbehind. They are variable in size and somewhat in position, standing\r\neither a little higher or lower; and they sometimes occur on one ear and\r\nnot on the other. Now the meaning of these projections is not, I think,\r\ndoubtful; but it may be thought that they offer too trifling a character\r\nto be worth notice. This thought, however, is as false as it is natural.\r\nEvery character, however slight, must be the result of some definite\r\ncause; and if it occurs in many individuals deserves consideration. The\r\nhelix obviously consists of the extreme margin of the ear folded\r\ninwards; and this folding appears to be in some manner connected with\r\nthe whole external ear being permanently pressed backwards. In many\r\nmonkeys, which do not stand high in the order, as baboons and some\r\nspecies of macacus,[27] the upper portion of the ear is slightly\r\npointed, and the margin is not at all folded inwards; but if the margin\r\nwere to be thus folded, a slight point would necessarily project inwards\r\nand probably a little outwards. This could actually be observed in a\r\nspecimen of the _Ateles beelzebuth_ in the Zoological Gardens; and we\r\nmay safely conclude that it is a similar structure--a vestige of\r\nformerly pointed ears--which occasionally reappears in man.\r\n\r\nThe nictitating membrane, or third eyelid, with its accessory muscles\r\nand other structures, is especially well developed in birds, and is of\r\nmuch functional importance to them, as it can be rapidly drawn across\r\nthe whole eye-ball. It is found in some reptiles and amphibians, and in\r\ncertain fishes, as in sharks. It is fairly well developed in the two\r\nlower divisions of the mammalian series, namely, in the monotremata and\r\nmarsupials, and in some few of the higher mammals, as in the walrus. But\r\nin man, the quadrumana, and most other mammals, it exists, as is\r\nadmitted by all anatomists, as a mere rudiment, called the semilunar\r\nfold.[28]\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell is of the highest importance to the greater number of\r\nmammals--to some, as the ruminants, in warning them of danger; to\r\nothers, as the carnivora, in finding their prey; to others, as the wild\r\nboar, for both purposes combined. But the sense of smell is of extremely\r\nslight service, if any, even to savages, in whom it is generally more\r\nhighly developed than in the civilised races. It does not warn them of\r\ndanger, nor guide them to their food; nor does it prevent the Esquimaux\r\nfrom sleeping in the most fetid atmosphere, nor many savages from eating\r\nhalf-putrid meat. Those who believe in the principle of gradual\r\nevolution, will not readily admit that this sense in its present state\r\nwas originally acquired by man, as he now exists. No doubt he inherits\r\nthe power in _an_ enfeebled and so far rudimentary condition, from some\r\nearly progenitor, to whom it was highly serviceable and by whom it was\r\ncontinually used. We can thus perhaps understand how it is, as Dr.\r\nMaudsley has truly remarked,[29] that the sense of smell in man \"is\r\nsingularly effective in recalling vividly the ideas and images of\r\nforgotten scenes and places;\" for we see in those animals, which have\r\nthis sense highly developed, such as dogs and horses, that old\r\nrecollections of persons and places are strongly associated with their\r\nodour.\r\n\r\nMan differs conspicuously from all the other Primates in being almost\r\nnaked. But a few short straggling hairs are found over the greater part\r\nof the body in the male sex, and fine down on that of the female sex, In\r\nindividuals belonging to the same race these hairs are highly variable,\r\nnot only in abundance, but likewise in position: thus the shoulders in\r\nsome Europeans are quite naked, whilst in others they bear thick tufts\r\nof hair.[30] There can be little doubt that the hairs thus scattered\r\nover the body are the rudiments of the uniform hairy coat of the lower\r\nanimals. This view is rendered all the more probable, as it is known\r\nthat fine, short, and pale-coloured hairs on the limbs and other parts\r\nof the body occasionally become developed into \"thickset, long, and\r\nrather coarse dark hairs,\" when abnormally nourished near old-standing\r\ninflamed surfaces.[31]\r\n\r\nI am informed by Mr. Paget that persons belonging to the same family\r\noften have a few hairs in their eyebrows much longer than the others; so\r\nthat this slight peculiarity seems to be inherited. These hairs\r\napparently represent the vibrissae, which are used as organs of touch by\r\nmany of the lower animals. In a young chimpanzee I observed that a few\r\nupright, rather long, hairs, projected above the eyes, where the true\r\neyebrows, if present, would have stood.\r\n\r\nThe fine wool-like hair, or so-called lanugo, with which the human\r\nfoetus during the sixth month is thickly covered, offers a more\r\ncurious case. It is first developed, during the fifth month, on the\r\neyebrows and face, and especially round the mouth, where it is much\r\nlonger than that on the head. A moustache of this kind was observed by\r\nEschricht[32] on a female foetus; but this is not so surprising a\r\ncircumstance as it may at first appear, for the two sexes generally\r\nresemble each other in all external characters during an early period of\r\ngrowth. The direction and arrangement of the hairs on all parts of the\r\nfoetal body are the same as in the adult, but are subject to much\r\nvariability. The whole surface, including even the forehead and ears, is\r\nthus thickly clothed; but it is a significant fact that the palms of the\r\nhands and the soles of the feet are quite naked, like the inferior\r\nsurfaces of all four extremities in most of the lower animals. As this\r\ncan hardly be an accidental coincidence, we must consider the woolly\r\ncovering of the foetus to be the rudimental representative of the\r\nfirst permanent coat of hair in those mammals which are born hairy. This\r\nrepresentation is much more complete, in accordance with the usual law\r\nof embryological development, than that afforded by the straggling hairs\r\non the body of the adult.\r\n\r\nIt appears as if the posterior molar or wisdom-teeth were tending to\r\nbecome rudimentary in the more civilised races of man. These teeth are\r\nrather smaller than the other molars, as is likewise the case with the\r\ncorresponding teeth in the chimpanzee and orang; and they have only two\r\nseparate fangs. They do not cut through the gums till about the\r\nseventeenth year, and I am assured by dentists that they are much more\r\nliable to decay, and are earlier lost, than the other teeth. It is also\r\nremarkable that they are much more liable to vary both in structure and\r\nin the period of their development than the other teeth.[33] In the\r\nMelanian races, on the other hand, the wisdom-teeth are usually\r\nfurnished with three separate fangs, and are generally sound: they also\r\ndiffer from the other molars in size less than in the Caucasian\r\nraces.[34] Prof. Schaaffhausen accounts for this difference between the\r\nraces by \"the posterior dental portion of the jaw being always\r\nshortened\" in those that are civilised,[35] and this shortening may, I\r\npresume, be safely attributed to civilised men habitually feeding on\r\nsoft, cooked food, and thus using their jaws less. I am informed by Mr.\r\nBrace that it is becoming quite a common practice in the United States\r\nto remove some of the molar teeth of children, as the jaw does not grow\r\nlarge enough for the perfect development of the normal number.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the alimentary canal I have met with an account of only\r\na single rudiment, namely the vermiform appendage of the caecum. The\r\ncaecum is a branch or diverticulum of the intestine, ending in a\r\ncul-de-sac, and it is extremely long in many of the lower\r\nvegetable-feeding mammals. In the marsupial koala it is actually more\r\nthan thrice as long as the whole body.[36] It is sometimes produced into\r\na long gradually-tapering point, and is sometimes constricted in parts.\r\nIt appears as if, in consequence of changed diet or habits, the caecum\r\nhad become much shortened in various animals, the vermiform appendage\r\nbeing left as a rudiment of the shortened part. That this appendage is a\r\nrudiment, we may infer from its small size, and from the evidence which\r\nProf. Canestrini[37] has collected of its variability in man. It is\r\noccasionally quite absent, or again is largely developed. The passage is\r\nsometimes completely closed for half or two-thirds of its length, with\r\nthe terminal part consisting of a flattened solid expansion. In the\r\norang this appendage is long and convoluted: in man it arises from the\r\nend of the short caecum, and is commonly from four to five inches in\r\nlength, being only about the third of an inch in diameter. Not only is\r\nit useless, but it is sometimes the cause of death, of which fact I have\r\nlately heard two instances: this is due to small hard bodies, such as\r\nseeds, entering the passage and causing inflammation.[38]\r\n\r\nIn the Quadrumana and some other orders of mammals, especially in the\r\nCarnivora, there is a passage near the lower end of the humerus, called\r\nthe supra-condyloid foramen, through which the great nerve of the fore\r\nlimb passes, and often the great artery. Now in the humerus of man, as\r\nDr. Struthers[39] and others have shewn, there is generally a trace of\r\nthis passage, and it is sometimes fairly well developed, being formed by\r\na depending hook-like process of bone, completed by a band of ligament.\r\nWhen present the great nerve invariably passes through it, and this\r\nclearly indicates that it is the homologue and rudiment of the\r\nsupra-condyloid foramen of the lower animals. Prof. Turner estimates, as\r\nhe informs me, that it occurs in about one per cent. of recent\r\nskeletons; but during ancient times it appears to have been much more\r\ncommon. Mr. Busk[40] has collected the following evidence on this head:\r\nProf. Broca \"noticed the perforation in four and a half per cent. of the\r\narm-bones collected in the 'Cimetiere du Sud' at Paris; and in the\r\nGrotto of Orrony, the contents of which are referred to the Bronze\r\nperiod, as many as eight humeri out of thirty-two were perforated; but\r\nthis extraordinary proportion, he thinks, might be due to the cavern\r\nhaving been a sort of 'family vault.' Again, M. Dupont found 30 per\r\ncent. of perforated bones in the caves of the Valley of the Lesse,\r\nbelonging to the Reindeer period; whilst M. Leguay, in a sort of\r\n_dolmen_ at Argenteuil, observed twenty-five per cent. to be perforated;\r\nand M. Pruner-Bey found twenty-six per cent. in the same condition in\r\nbones from Vaureal. Nor should it be left unnoticed that M. Pruner-Bey\r\nstates that this condition is common in Guanche skeletons.\" The fact\r\nthat ancient races, in this and several other cases, more frequently\r\npresent structures which resemble those of the lower animals than do the\r\nmodern races, is interesting. One chief cause seems to be that ancient\r\nraces stand somewhat nearer than modern races in the long line of\r\ndescent to their remote animal-like progenitors.\r\n\r\nThe os coccyx in man, though functionless as a tail, plainly represents\r\nthis part in other vertebrate animals. At an early embryonic period it\r\nis free, and, as we have seen, projects beyond the lower extremities. In\r\ncertain rare and anomalous cases it has been known, according to Isidore\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire and others,[41] to form a small external rudiment\r\nof a tail. The os coccyx is short, usually including only four vertebrae:\r\nand these are in a rudimental condition, for they consist, with the\r\nexception of the basal one, of the centrum alone.[42] They are furnished\r\nwith some small muscles; one of which, as I am informed by Prof. Turner,\r\nhas been expressly described by Theile as a rudimentary repetition of\r\nthe extensor of the tail, which is so largely developed in many mammals.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord in man extends only as far downwards as the last dorsal\r\nor first lumbar vertebra; but a thread-like structure (the _filum\r\nterminale_) runs down the axis of the sacral part of the spinal canal,\r\nand even along the back of the coccygeal bones. The upper part of this\r\nfilament, as Prof. Turner informs me, is undoubtedly homologous with the\r\nspinal cord; but the lower part apparently consists merely of the _pia\r\nmater_, or vascular investing membrane. Even in this case the os coccyx\r\nmay be said to possess a vestige of so important a structure as the\r\nspinal cord, though no longer enclosed within a bony canal. The\r\nfollowing fact, for which I am also indebted to Prof. Turner, shews how\r\nclosely the os coccyx corresponds with the true tail in the lower\r\nanimals: Luschka has recently discovered at the extremity of the\r\ncoccygeal bones a very peculiar convoluted body, which is continuous\r\nwith the middle sacral artery; and this discovery led Krause and Meyer\r\nto examine the tail of a monkey (Macacus) and of a cat, in both of which\r\nthey found, though not at the extremity, a similarly convoluted body.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive system offers various rudimentary structures; but these\r\ndiffer in one important respect from the foregoing cases. We are not\r\nhere concerned with a vestige of a part which does not belong to the\r\nspecies in an efficient state; but with a part which is always present\r\nand efficient in the one sex, being represented in the other by a mere\r\nrudiment. Nevertheless, the occurrence of such rudiments is as difficult\r\nto explain on the belief of the separate creation of each species, as in\r\nthe foregoing cases. Hereafter I shall have to recur to these rudiments,\r\nand shall shew that their presence generally depends merely on\r\ninheritance; namely, on parts acquired by one sex having been partially\r\ntransmitted to the other. Here I will only give some instances of such\r\nrudiments. It is well known that in the males of all mammals, including\r\nman, rudimentary mammae exist. These in several instances have become\r\nwell developed, and have yielded a copious supply of milk. Their\r\nessential identity in the two sexes is likewise shewn by their\r\noccasional sympathetic enlargement in both during an attack of the\r\nmeasles. The _vesicula prostatica_, which has been observed in many\r\nmale mammals, is now universally acknowledged to be the homologue of the\r\nfemale uterus, together with the connected passage. It is impossible to\r\nread Leuckart's able description of this organ, and his reasoning,\r\nwithout admitting the justness of his conclusion. This is especially\r\nclear in the case of those mammals in which the true female uterus\r\nbifurcates, for in the males of these the vesicula likewise\r\nbifurcates.[43] Some additional rudimentary structures belonging to the\r\nreproductive system might here have been adduced.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the three great classes of facts now given is\r\nunmistakeable. But it would be superfluous here fully to recapitulate\r\nthe line of argument given in detail in my 'Origin of Species.' The\r\nhomological construction of the whole frame in the members of the same\r\nclass is intelligible, if we admit their descent from a common\r\nprogenitor, together with their subsequent adaptation to diversified\r\nconditions. On any other view the similarity of pattern between the hand\r\nof a man or monkey, the foot of a horse, the flipper of a seal, the wing\r\nof a bat, &c., is utterly inexplicable. It is no scientific explanation\r\nto assert that they have all been formed on the same ideal plan. With\r\nrespect to development, we can clearly understand, on the principle of\r\nvariations supervening at a rather late embryonic period, and being\r\ninherited at a corresponding period, how it is that the embryos of\r\nwonderfully different forms should still retain, more or less perfectly,\r\nthe structure of their common progenitor. No other explanation has ever\r\nbeen given of the marvellous fact that the embryo of a man, dog, seal,\r\nbat, reptile, &c., can at first hardly be distinguished from each other.\r\nIn order to understand the existence of rudimentary organs, we have only\r\nto suppose that a former progenitor possessed the parts in question in a\r\nperfect state, and that under changed habits of life they became greatly\r\nreduced, either from simple disuse, or through the natural selection of\r\nthose individuals which were least encumbered with a superfluous part,\r\naided by the other means previously indicated.\r\n\r\nThus we can understand how it has come to pass that man and all other\r\nvertebrate animals have been constructed on the same general model, why\r\nthey pass through the same early stages of development, and why they\r\nretain certain rudiments in common. Consequently we ought frankly to\r\nadmit their community of descent: to take any other view, is to admit\r\nthat our own structure and that of all the animals around us, is a mere\r\nsnare laid to entrap our judgment. This conclusion is greatly\r\nstrengthened, if we look to the members of the whole animal series, and\r\nconsider the evidence derived from their affinities or classification,\r\ntheir geographical distribution and geological succession. It is only\r\nour natural prejudice, and that arrogance which made our forefathers\r\ndeclare that they were descended from demi-gods, which leads us to demur\r\nto this conclusion. But the time will before long come when it will be\r\nthought wonderful, that naturalists, who were well acquainted with the\r\ncomparative structure and development of man and other mammals, should\r\nhave believed that each was the work of a separate act of creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE MENTAL POWERS OF MAN AND THE LOWER ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The difference in mental power between the highest ape and the\r\n  lowest savage, immense--Certain instincts in common--The\r\n  emotions--Curiosity--Imitation--Attention--Memory--Imagination\r\n  --Reason--Progressive improvement--Tools and weapons used by\r\n  animals--Language--Self-consciousness--Sense of beauty--Belief\r\n  in God, spiritual agencies, superstitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last chapter that man bears in his bodily structure\r\nclear traces of his descent from some lower form; but it may be urged\r\nthat, as man differs so greatly in his mental power from all other\r\nanimals, there must be some error in this conclusion. No doubt the\r\ndifference in this respect is enormous, even if we compare the mind of\r\none of the lowest savages, who has no words to express any number higher\r\nthan four, and who uses no abstract terms for the commonest objects or\r\naffections,[45] with that of the most highly organised ape. The\r\ndifference would, no doubt, still remain immense, even if one of the\r\nhigher apes had been improved or civilised as much as a dog has been in\r\ncomparison with its parent-form, the wolf or jackal. The Fuegians rank\r\namongst the lowest barbarians; but I was continually struck with\r\nsurprise how closely the three natives on board H.M.S. \"Beagle,\" who had\r\nlived some years in England and could talk a little English, resembled\r\nus in disposition and in most of our mental faculties. If no organic\r\nbeing excepting man had possessed any mental power, or if his powers had\r\nbeen of a wholly different nature from those of the lower animals, then\r\nwe should never have been able to convince ourselves that our high\r\nfaculties had been gradually developed. But it can be clearly shewn that\r\nthere is no fundamental difference of this kind. We must also admit that\r\nthere is a much wider interval in mental power between one of the lowest\r\nfishes, as a lamprey or lancelet, and one of the higher apes, than\r\nbetween an ape and man; yet this immense interval is filled up by\r\nnumberless gradations.\r\n\r\nNor is the difference slight in moral disposition between a barbarian,\r\nsuch as the man described by the old navigator Byron, who dashed his\r\nchild on the rocks for dropping a basket of sea-urchins, and a Howard or\r\nClarkson; and in intellect, between a savage who does not use any\r\nabstract terms, and a Newton or Shakspeare. Differences of this kind\r\nbetween the highest men of the highest races and the lowest savages, are\r\nconnected by the finest gradations. Therefore it is possible that they\r\nmight pass and be developed into each other.\r\n\r\nMy object in this chapter is solely to shew that there is no fundamental\r\ndifference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties.\r\nEach division of the subject might have been extended into a separate\r\nessay, but must here be treated briefly. As no classification of the\r\nmental powers has been universally accepted, I shall arrange my remarks\r\nin the order most convenient for my purpose; and will select those facts\r\nwhich have most struck me, with the hope that they may produce some\r\neffect on the reader.\r\n\r\nWith respect to animals very low in the scale, I shall have to give some\r\nadditional facts under Sexual Selection, shewing that their mental\r\npowers are higher than might have been expected. The variability of the\r\nfaculties in the individuals of the same species is an important point\r\nfor us, and some few illustrations will here be given. But it would be\r\nsuperfluous to enter into many details on this head, for I have found on\r\nfrequent enquiry, that it is the unanimous opinion of all those who have\r\nlong attended to animals of many kinds, including birds, that the\r\nindividuals differ greatly in every mental characteristic. In what\r\nmanner the mental powers were first developed in the lowest organisms,\r\nis as hopeless an enquiry as how life first originated. These are\r\nproblems for the distant future, if they are ever to be solved by man.\r\n\r\nAs man possesses the same senses with the lower animals, his fundamental\r\nintuitions must be the same. Man has also some few instincts in common,\r\nas that of self-preservation, sexual love, the love of the mother for\r\nher new-born offspring, the power possessed by the latter of sucking,\r\nand so forth. But man, perhaps, has somewhat fewer instincts than those\r\npossessed by the animals which come next to him in the series. The orang\r\nin the Eastern islands, and the chimpanzee in Africa, build platforms on\r\nwhich they sleep; and, as both species follow the same habit, it might\r\nbe argued that this was due to instinct, but we cannot feel sure that it\r\nis not the result of both animals having similar wants and possessing\r\nsimilar powers of reasoning. These apes, as we may assume, avoid the\r\nmany poisonous fruits of the tropics, and man has no such knowledge; but\r\nas our domestic animals, when taken to foreign lands and when first\r\nturned out in the spring, often eat poisonous herbs, which they\r\nafterwards avoid, we cannot feel sure that the apes do not learn from\r\ntheir own experience or from that of their parents what fruits to\r\nselect. It is however certain, as we shall presently see, that apes\r\nhave an instinctive dread of serpents, and probably of other dangerous\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe fewness and the comparative simplicity of the instincts in the\r\nhigher animals are remarkable in contrast with those of the lower\r\nanimals. Cuvier maintained that instinct and intelligence stand in an\r\ninverse ratio to each other; and some have thought that the intellectual\r\nfaculties of the higher animals have been gradually developed from their\r\ninstincts. But Pouchet, in an interesting essay,[46] has shewn that no\r\nsuch inverse ratio really exists. Those insects which possess the most\r\nwonderful instincts are certainly the most intelligent. In the\r\nvertebrate series, the least intelligent members, namely fishes and\r\namphibians, do not possess complex instincts; and amongst mammals the\r\nanimal most remarkable for its instincts, namely the beaver, is highly\r\nintelligent, as will be admitted by every one who has read Mr. Morgan's\r\nexcellent account of this animal.[47]\r\n\r\nAlthough the first dawnings of intelligence, according to Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer,[48] have been developed through the multiplication and\r\nco-ordination of reflex actions, and although many of the simpler\r\ninstincts graduate into actions of this kind and can hardly be\r\ndistinguished from them, as in the case of young animals sucking, yet\r\nthe more complex instincts seem to have originated independently of\r\nintelligence. I am, however, far from wishing to deny that instinctive\r\nactions may lose their fixed and untaught character, and be replaced by\r\nothers performed by the aid of the free will. On the other hand, some\r\nintelligent actions--as when, birds on oceanic islands first learn to\r\navoid man--after being performed during many generations, become\r\nconverted into instincts and are inherited. They may then be said to be\r\ndegraded in character, for they are no longer performed through reason\r\nor from experience. But the greater number of the more complex instincts\r\nappear to have been gained in a wholly different manner, through the\r\nnatural selection of variations of simpler instinctive actions. Such\r\nvariations appear to arise from the same unknown causes acting on the\r\ncerebral organisation, which induce slight variations or individual\r\ndifferences in other parts of the body; and these variations, owing to\r\nour ignorance, are often said to arise spontaneously. We can, I think,\r\ncome to no other conclusion with respect to the origin of the more\r\ncomplex instincts, when we reflect on the marvellous instincts of\r\nsterile worker-ants and bees, which leave no offspring to inherit the\r\neffects of experience and of modified habits.\r\n\r\nAlthough a high degree of intelligence is certainly compatible with the\r\nexistence of complex instincts, as we see in the insects just named and\r\nin the beaver, it is not improbable that they may to a certain extent\r\ninterfere with each other's development. Little is known about the\r\nfunctions of the brain, but we can perceive that as the intellectual\r\npowers become highly developed, the various parts of the brain must be\r\nconnected by the most intricate channels of intercommunication; and as a\r\nconsequence each separate part would perhaps tend to become less well\r\nfitted to answer in a definite and uniform, that is instinctive, manner\r\nto particular sensations or associations.\r\n\r\nI have thought this digression worth giving, because we may easily\r\nunderrate the mental powers of the higher animals, and especially of\r\nman, when we compare their actions founded on the memory of past events,\r\non foresight, reason, and imagination, with exactly similar actions\r\ninstinctively performed by the lower animals; in this latter case the\r\ncapacity of performing such actions having been gained, step by step,\r\nthrough the variability of the mental organs and natural selection,\r\nwithout any conscious intelligence on the part of the animal during each\r\nsuccessive generation. No doubt, as Mr. Wallace has argued,[49] much of\r\nthe intelligent work done by man is due to imitation and not to reason;\r\nbut there is this great difference between his actions and many of those\r\nperformed by the lower animals, namely, that man cannot, on his first\r\ntrial, make, for instance, a stone hatchet or a canoe, through his power\r\nof imitation. He has to learn his work by practice; a beaver, on the\r\nother hand, can make its dam or canal, and a bird its nest, as well, or\r\nnearly as well, the first time it tries, as when old and experienced.\r\n\r\nTo return to our immediate subject: the lower animals, like man,\r\nmanifestly feel pleasure and pain, happiness and misery. Happiness is\r\nnever better exhibited than by young animals, such as puppies, kittens,\r\nlambs, &c., when playing together, like our own children. Even insects\r\nplay together, as has been described by that excellent observer, P.\r\nHuber,[50] who saw ants chasing and pretending to bite each other, like\r\nso many puppies.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the lower animals are excited by the same emotions as\r\nourselves is so well established, that it will not be necessary to weary\r\nthe reader by many details. Terror acts in the same manner on them as on\r\nus, causing the muscles to tremble, the heart to palpitate, the\r\nsphincters to be relaxed, and the hair to stand on end. Suspicion, the\r\noffspring of fear, is eminently characteristic of most wild animals.\r\nCourage and timidity are extremely variable qualities in the\r\nindividuals of the same species, as is plainly seen in our dogs. Some\r\ndogs and horses are ill-tempered and easily turn sulky; others are\r\ngood-tempered; and these qualities are certainly inherited. Every one\r\nknows how liable animals are to furious rage, and how plainly they show\r\nit. Many anecdotes, probably true, have been published on the\r\nlong-delayed and artful revenge of various animals. The accurate Rengger\r\nand Brehm[51] state that the American and African monkeys which they\r\nkept tame, certainly revenged themselves. The love of a dog for his\r\nmaster is notorious; in the agony of death he has been known to caress\r\nhis master, and every one has heard of the dog suffering under\r\nvivisection, who licked the hand of the operator; this man, unless he\r\nhad a heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of his\r\nlife. As Whewell[52] has remarked, \"who that reads the touching\r\ninstances of maternal affection, related so often of the women of all\r\nnations, and of the females of all animals, can doubt that the principle\r\nof action is the same in the two cases?\"\r\n\r\nWe see maternal affection exhibited in the most trifling details; thus\r\nRengger observed an American monkey (a Cebus) carefully driving away the\r\nflies which plagued her infant; and Duvaucel saw a Hylobates washing the\r\nfaces of her young ones in a stream. So intense is the grief of female\r\nmonkeys for the loss of their young, that it invariably caused the death\r\nof certain kinds kept under confinement by Brehm in N. Africa.\r\nOrphan-monkeys were always adopted and carefully guarded by the other\r\nmonkeys, both males and females. One female baboon had so capacious a\r\nheart that she not only adopted young monkeys of other species, but\r\nstole young dogs and cats, which she continually carried about. Her\r\nkindness, however, did not go so far as to share her food with her\r\nadopted offspring, at which Brehm was surprised, as his monkeys always\r\ndivided everything quite fairly with their own young ones. An adopted\r\nkitten scratched the above-mentioned affectionate baboon, who certainly\r\nhad a fine intellect, for she was much astonished at being scratched,\r\nand immediately examined the kitten's feet, and without more ado bit off\r\nthe claws. In the Zoological Gardens, I heard from the keeper that an\r\nold baboon (_C. chacma_) had adopted a Rhesus monkey; but when a young\r\ndrill and mandrill were placed in the cage, she seemed to perceive that\r\nthese monkeys, though distinct species, were her nearer relatives, for\r\nshe at once rejected the Rhesus and adopted both of them. The young\r\nRhesus, as I saw, was greatly discontented at being thus rejected, and\r\nit would, like a naughty child, annoy and attack the young drill and\r\nmandrill whenever it could do so with safety; this conduct exciting\r\ngreat indignation in the old baboon. Monkeys will also, according to\r\nBrehm, defend their master when attacked by any one, as well as dogs to\r\nwhom they are attached, from the attacks of other dogs. But we here\r\ntrench on the subject of sympathy, to which I shall recur. Some of\r\nBrehm's monkeys took much delight in teasing, in various ingenious ways,\r\na certain old dog whom they disliked, as well as other animals.\r\n\r\nMost of the more complex emotions are common to the higher animals and\r\nourselves. Every one has seen how jealous a dog is of his master's\r\naffection, if lavished on any other creature; and I have observed the\r\nsame fact with monkeys. This shews that animals not only love, but have\r\nthe desire to be loved. Animals manifestly feel emulation. They love\r\napprobation or praise; and a dog carrying a basket for his master\r\nexhibits in a high degree self-complacency or pride. There can, I think,\r\nbe no doubt that a dog feels shame, as distinct from fear, and something\r\nvery like modesty when begging too often for food. A great dog scorns\r\nthe snarling of a little dog, and this may be called magnanimity.\r\nSeveral observers have stated that monkeys certainly dislike being\r\nlaughed at; and they sometimes invent imaginary offences. In the\r\nZoological Gardens I saw a baboon who always got into a furious rage\r\nwhen his keeper took out a letter or book and read it aloud to him; and\r\nhis rage was so violent that, as I witnessed on one occasion, he bit his\r\nown leg till the blood flowed.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the more intellectual emotions and faculties, which\r\nare very important, as forming the basis for the development of the\r\nhigher mental powers. Animals manifestly enjoy excitement and suffer\r\nfrom ennui, as may be seen with dogs, and, according to Rengger, with\r\nmonkeys. All animals feel Wonder, and many exhibit Curiosity. They\r\nsometimes suffer from this latter quality, as when the hunter plays\r\nantics and thus attracts them; I have witnessed this with deer, and so\r\nit is with the wary chamois, and with some kinds of wild-ducks. Brehm\r\ngives a curious account of the instinctive dread which his monkeys\r\nexhibited towards snakes; but their curiosity was so great that they\r\ncould not desist from occasionally satiating their horror in a most\r\nhuman fashion, by lifting up the lid of the box in which the snakes were\r\nkept. I was so much surprised at his account, that I took a stuffed and\r\ncoiled-up snake into the monkey-house at the Zoological Gardens, and the\r\nexcitement thus caused was one of the most curious spectacles which I\r\never beheld. Three species of Cercopithecus were the most alarmed; they\r\ndashed about their cages and uttered sharp signal-cries of danger, which\r\nwere understood by the other monkeys. A few young monkeys and one old\r\nAnubis baboon alone took no notice of the snake. I then placed the\r\nstuffed specimen on the ground in one of the larger compartments. After\r\na time all the monkeys collected round it in a large circle, and staring\r\nintently, presented a most ludicrous appearance. They became extremely\r\nnervous; so that when a wooden ball, with which they were familiar as a\r\nplaything, was accidently moved in the straw, under which it was partly\r\nhidden, they all instantly started away. These monkeys behaved very\r\ndifferently when a dead fish, a mouse, and some other new objects were\r\nplaced in their cages; for though at first frightened, they soon\r\napproached, handled and examined them. I then placed a live snake in a\r\npaper bag, with the mouth loosely closed, in one of the larger\r\ncompartments. One of the monkeys immediately approached, cautiously\r\nopened the bag a little, peeped in, and instantly dashed away. Then I\r\nwitnessed what Brehm has described, for monkey after monkey, with head\r\nraised high and turned on one side, could not resist taking momentary\r\npeeps into the upright bag, at the dreadful object lying quiet at the\r\nbottom. It would almost appear as if monkeys had some notion of\r\nzoological affinities, for those kept by Brehm exhibited a strange,\r\nthough mistaken, instinctive dread of innocent lizards and frogs. An\r\norang, also, has been known to be much alarmed at the first sight of a\r\nturtle.[53]\r\n\r\nThe principle of _Imitation_ is strong in man, and especially in man in\r\na barbarous state. Desor[54] has remarked that no animal voluntarily\r\nimitates an action performed by man, until in the ascending scale we\r\ncome to monkeys, which are well-known to be ridiculous mockers. Animals,\r\nhowever, sometimes imitate each others' actions: thus two species of\r\nwolves, which had been reared by dogs, learned to bark, as does\r\nsometimes the jackal,[55] but whether this can be called voluntary\r\nimitation is another question. From one account which I have read, there\r\nis reason to believe that puppies nursed by cats sometimes learn to lick\r\ntheir feet and thus to clean their faces: it is at least certain, as I\r\nhear from a perfectly trustworthy friend, that some dogs behave in this\r\nmanner. Birds imitate the songs of their parents, and sometimes those of\r\nother birds; and parrots are notorious imitators of any sound which they\r\noften hear.\r\n\r\nHardly any faculty is more important for the intellectual progress of\r\nman than the power of _Attention_. Animals clearly manifest this power,\r\nas when a cat watches by a hole and prepares to spring on its prey. Wild\r\nanimals sometimes become so absorbed when thus engaged, that they may be\r\neasily approached. Mr. Bartlett has given me a curious proof how\r\nvariable this faculty is in monkeys. A man who trains monkeys to act\r\nused to purchase common kinds from the Zoological Society at the price\r\nof five pounds for each; but he offered to give double the price, if he\r\nmight keep three or four of them for a few days, in order to select one.\r\nWhen asked how he could possibly so soon learn whether a particular\r\nmonkey would turn out a good actor, he answered that it all depended on\r\ntheir power of attention. If when he was talking and explaining anything\r\nto a monkey, its attention was easily distracted, as by a fly on the\r\nwall or other trifling object, the case was hopeless. If he tried by\r\npunishment to make an inattentive monkey act, it turned sulky. On the\r\nother hand, a monkey which carefully attended to him could always be\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\nIt is almost superfluous to state that animals have excellent _Memories_\r\nfor persons and places. A baboon at the Cape of Good Hope, as I have\r\nbeen informed by Sir Andrew Smith, recognised him with joy after an\r\nabsence of nine months. I had a dog who was savage and averse to all\r\nstrangers, and I purposely tried his memory after an absence of five\r\nyears and two days. I went near the stable where he lived, and shouted\r\nto him in my old manner; he showed no joy, but instantly followed me out\r\nwalking and obeyed me, exactly as if I had parted with him only\r\nhalf-an-hour before. A train of old associations, dormant during five\r\nyears, had thus been instantaneously awakened in his mind. Even ants, as\r\nP. Huber[56] has clearly shewn, recognised their fellow-ants belonging\r\nto the same community after a separation of four months. Animals can\r\ncertainly by some means judge of the intervals of time between recurrent\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe _Imagination_ is one of the highest prerogatives of man. By this\r\nfaculty he unites, independently of the will, former images and ideas,\r\nand thus creates brilliant and novel results. A poet, as Jean Paul\r\nRichter remarks,[57] \"who must reflect whether he shall make a\r\ncharacter say yes or no--to the devil with him; he is only a stupid\r\ncorpse.\" Dreaming gives us the best notion of this power; as Jean Paul\r\nagain says, \"The dream is an involuntary art of poetry.\" The value of\r\nthe products of our imagination depends of course on the number,\r\naccuracy, and clearness of our impressions; on our judgment and taste in\r\nselecting or rejecting the involuntary combinations, and to a certain\r\nextent on our power of voluntarily combining them. As dogs, cats,\r\nhorses, and probably all the higher animals, even birds, as is stated on\r\ngood authority,[58] have vivid dreams, and this is shewn by their\r\nmovements and voice, we must admit that they possess some power of\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nOf all the faculties of the human mind, it will, I presume, be admitted\r\nthat _Reason_ stands at the summit. Few persons any longer dispute that\r\nanimals possess some power of reasoning. Animals may constantly be seen\r\nto pause, deliberate, and resolve. It is a significant fact, that the\r\nmore the habits of any particular animal are studied by a naturalist,\r\nthe more he attributes to reason and the less to unlearnt instincts.[59]\r\nIn future chapters we shall see that some animals extremely low in the\r\nscale apparently display a certain amount of reason. No doubt it is\r\noften difficult to distinguish between the power of reason and that of\r\ninstinct. Thus Dr. Hayes, in his work on 'The Open Polar Sea,'\r\nrepeatedly remarks that his dogs, instead of continuing to draw the\r\nsledges in a compact body, diverged and separated when they came to thin\r\nice, so that their weight might be more evenly distributed. This was\r\noften the first warning and notice which the travellers received that\r\nthe ice was becoming thin and dangerous. Now, did the dogs act thus from\r\nthe experience of each individual, or from the example of the older and\r\nwiser dogs, or from an inherited habit, that is from an instinct? This\r\ninstinct might possibly have arisen since the time, long ago, when dogs\r\nwere first employed by the natives in drawing their sledges; or the\r\nArctic wolves, the parent-stock of the Esquimaux dog, may have acquired\r\nthis instinct, impelling them not to attack their prey in a close pack\r\nwhen on thin ice. Questions of this kind are most difficult to answer.\r\n\r\nSo many facts have been recorded in various works shewing that animals\r\npossess some degree of reason, that I will here give only two or three\r\ninstances, authenticated by Rengger, and relating to American monkeys,\r\nwhich stand low in their order. He states that when he first gave eggs\r\nto his monkeys, they smashed them and thus lost much of their contents;\r\nafterwards they gently hit one end against some hard body, and picked\r\noff the bits of shell with their fingers. After cutting themselves only\r\nonce with any sharp tool, they would not touch it again, or would handle\r\nit with the greatest care. Lumps of sugar were often given them wrapped\r\nup in paper; and Rengger sometimes put a live wasp in the paper, so that\r\nin hastily unfolding it they got stung; after this had once happened,\r\nthey always first held the packet to their ears to detect any movement\r\nwithin. Any one who is not convinced by such facts as these, and by what\r\nhe may observe with his own dogs, that animals can reason, would not be\r\nconvinced by anything that I could add. Nevertheless I will give one\r\ncase with respect to dogs, as it rests on two distinct observers, and\r\ncan hardly depend on the modification of any instinct.\r\n\r\nMr. Colquhoun[60] winged two wild-ducks, which fell on the opposite side\r\nof a stream; his retriever tried to bring over both at once, but could\r\nnot succeed; she then, though never before known to ruffle a feather,\r\ndeliberately killed one, brought over the other, and returned for the\r\ndead bird. Col. Hutchinson relates that two partridges were shot at\r\nonce, one being killed, the other wounded; the latter ran away, and was\r\ncaught by the retriever, who on her return came across the dead bird;\r\n\"she stopped, evidently greatly puzzled, and after one or two trials,\r\nfinding she could not take it up without permitting the escape of the\r\nwinged bird, she considered a moment, then deliberately murdered it by\r\ngiving it a severe crunch, and afterwards brought away both together.\r\nThis was the only known instance of her ever having wilfully injured any\r\ngame.\" Here we have reason, though not quite perfect, for the retriever\r\nmight have brought the wounded bird first and then returned for the dead\r\none, as in the case of the two wild-ducks.\r\n\r\nThe muleteers in S. America say, \"I will not give you the mule whose\r\nstep is easiest, but _la mas rational_,--the one that reasons best;\" and\r\nHumboldt[61] adds, \"this popular expression, dictated by long\r\nexperience, combats the system of animated machines, better perhaps than\r\nall the arguments of speculative philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has, I think, now been shewn that man and the higher animals,\r\nespecially the Primates, have some few instincts in common. All have the\r\nsame senses, intuitions and sensations--similar passions, affections,\r\nand emotions, even the more complex ones; they feel wonder and\r\ncuriosity; they possess the same faculties of imitation, attention,\r\nmemory, imagination, and reason, though in very different degrees.\r\nNevertheless many authors have insisted that man is separated through\r\nhis mental faculties by an impassable barrier from all the lower\r\nanimals. I formerly made a collection of above a score of such\r\naphorisms, but they are not worth giving, as their wide difference and\r\nnumber prove the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of the attempt.\r\nIt has been asserted that man alone is capable of progressive\r\nimprovement; that he alone makes use of tools or fire, domesticates\r\nother animals, possesses property, or employs language; that no other\r\nanimal is self-conscious, comprehends itself, has the power of\r\nabstraction, or possesses general ideas; that man alone has a sense of\r\nbeauty, is liable to caprice, has the feeling of gratitude, mystery,\r\n&c.; believes in God, or is endowed with a conscience. I will hazard a\r\nfew remarks on the more important and interesting of these points.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Sumner formerly maintained[62] that man alone is capable of\r\nprogressive improvement. With animals, looking first to the individual,\r\nevery one who has had any experience in setting traps knows that young\r\nanimals can be caught much more easily than old ones; and they can be\r\nmuch more easily approached by an enemy. Even with respect to old\r\nanimals, it is impossible to catch many in the same place and in the\r\nsame kind of trap, or to destroy them by the same kind of poison; yet it\r\nis improbable that all should have partaken of the poison, and\r\nimpossible that all should have been caught in the trap. They must learn\r\ncaution by seeing their brethren caught or poisoned. In North America,\r\nwhere the fur-bearing animals have long been pursued, they exhibit,\r\naccording to the unanimous testimony of all observers, an almost\r\nincredible amount of sagacity, caution, and cunning; but trapping has\r\nbeen there so long carried on that inheritance may have come into play.\r\n\r\nIf we look to successive generations, or to the race, there is no doubt\r\nthat birds and other animals gradually both acquire and lose caution in\r\nrelation to man or other enemies;[63] and this caution is certainly in\r\nchief part an inherited habit or instinct, but in part the result of\r\nindividual experience. A good observer, Leroy,[64] states that in\r\ndistricts where foxes are much hunted, the young when they first leave\r\ntheir burrows are incontestably much more wary than the old ones in\r\ndistricts where they are not much disturbed.\r\n\r\nOur domestic dogs are descended from wolves and jackals,[65] and though\r\nthey may not have gained in cunning, and may have lost in waryness and\r\nsuspicion, yet they have progressed in certain moral qualities, such as\r\nin affection, trust-worthiness, temper, and probably in general\r\nintelligence. The common rat has conquered and beaten several other\r\nspecies throughout Europe, in parts of North America, New Zealand, and\r\nrecently in Formosa, as well as on the mainland of China. Mr.\r\nSwinhoe,[66] who describes these latter cases, attributes the victory of\r\nthe common rat over the large _Mus coninga_ to its superior cunning; and\r\nthis latter quality may be attributed to the habitual exercise of all\r\nits faculties in avoiding extirpation by man, as well as to nearly all\r\nthe less cunning or weak-minded rats having been successively destroyed\r\nby him. To maintain, independently of any direct evidence, that no\r\nanimal during the course of ages has progressed in intellect or other\r\nmental faculties, is to beg the question of the evolution of species.\r\nHereafter we shall see that, according to Lartet, existing mammals\r\nbelonging to several orders have larger brains than their ancient\r\ntertiary prototypes.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that no animal uses any tool; but the chimpanzee\r\nin a state of nature cracks a native fruit, somewhat like a walnut, with\r\na stone.[67] Rengger[68] easily taught an American monkey thus to break\r\nopen hard palm-nuts, and afterwards of its own accord it used stones to\r\nopen other kinds of nuts, as well as boxes. It thus also removed the\r\nsoft rind of fruit that had a disagreeable flavour. Another monkey was\r\ntaught to open the lid of a large box with a stick, and afterwards it\r\nused the stick as a lever to move heavy bodies; and I have myself seen a\r\nyoung orang put a stick into a crevice, slip his hand to the other end,\r\nand use it in the proper manner as a lever. In the cases just mentioned\r\nstones and sticks were employed as implements; but they are likewise\r\nused as weapons. Brehm[69] states, on the authority of the well-known\r\ntraveller Schimper, that in Abyssinia when the baboons belonging to one\r\nspecies (_C. gelada_) descend in troops from the mountains to plunder\r\nthe fields, they sometimes encounter troops of another species (_C.\r\nhamadryas_), and then a fight ensues. The Geladas roll down great\r\nstones, which the Hamadryas try to avoid, and then, both species,\r\nmaking a great uproar, rush furiously against each other. Brehm, when\r\naccompanying the Duke of Coburg-Gotha, aided in an attack with fire-arms\r\non a troop of baboons in the pass of Mensa in Abyssinia. The baboons in\r\nreturn rolled so many stones down the mountain, some as large as a man's\r\nhead, that the attackers had to beat a hasty retreat; and the pass was\r\nactually for a time closed against the caravan. It deserves notice that\r\nthese baboons thus acted in concert. Mr. Wallace[70] on three occasions\r\nsaw female orangs, accompanied by their young, \"breaking off branches\r\nand the great spiny fruit of the Durian tree, with every appearance of\r\nrage; causing such a shower of missiles as effectually kept us from\r\napproaching too near the tree.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Zoological Gardens a monkey which had weak teeth used to break\r\nopen nuts with a stone; and I was assured by the keepers that this\r\nanimal, after using the stone, hid it in the straw, and would not let\r\nany other monkey touch it. Here, then, we have the idea of property; but\r\nthis idea is common to every dog with a bone, and to most or all birds\r\nwith their nests.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll[71] remarks, that the fashioning of an implement for\r\na special purpose is absolutely peculiar to man; and he considers that\r\nthis forms an immeasurable gulf between him and the brutes. It is no\r\ndoubt a very important distinction, but there appears to me much truth\r\nin Sir J. Lubbock's suggestion,[72] that when primeval man first used\r\nflint-stones for any purpose, he would have accidentally splintered\r\nthem, and would then have used the sharp fragments. From this step it\r\nwould be a small one to intentionally break the flints, and not a very\r\nwide step to rudely fashion them. This latter advance, however, may have\r\ntaken long ages, if we may judge by the immense interval of time which\r\nelapsed before the men of the neolithic period took to grinding and\r\npolishing their stone tools. In breaking the flints, as Sir J. Lubbock\r\nlikewise remarks, sparks would have been emitted, and in grinding them\r\nheat would have been evolved: \"thus the two usual methods of obtaining\r\nfire may have originated.\" The nature of fire would have been known in\r\nthe many volcanic regions where lava occasionally flows through forests.\r\nThe anthropomorphous apes, guided probably by instinct, build for\r\nthemselves temporary platforms; but as many instincts are largely\r\ncontrolled by reason, the simpler ones, such as this of building a\r\nplatform, might readily pass into a voluntary and conscious act. The\r\norang is known to cover itself at night with the leaves of the Pandanus;\r\nand Brehm states that one of his baboons used to protect itself from the\r\nheat of the sun by throwing a straw-mat over its head. In these latter\r\nhabits, we probably see the first steps towards some of the simpler\r\narts; namely rude architecture and dress, as they arose amongst the\r\nearly progenitors of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Language._--This faculty has justly been considered as one of the chief\r\ndistinctions between man and the lower animals. But man, as a highly\r\ncompetent judge, Archbishop Whately remarks, \"is not the only animal\r\nthat can make use of language to express what is passing in his mind,\r\nand can understand, more or less, what is so expressed by another.\"[73]\r\nIn Paraguay the _Cebus Azarae_ when excited utters at least six distinct\r\nsounds, which excite in other monkeys similar emotions.[74] The\r\nmovements of the features and gestures of monkeys are understood by us,\r\nand they partly understand ours, as Rengger and others declare. It is a\r\nmore remarkable fact that the dog, since being domesticated, has learnt\r\nto bark[75] in at least four or five distinct tones. Although barking is\r\na new art, no doubt the wild species, the parents of the dog, expressed\r\ntheir feelings by cries of various kinds. With the domesticated dog we\r\nhave the bark of eagerness, as in the chase; that of anger; the yelping\r\nor howling bark of despair, as when shut up; that of joy, as when\r\nstarting on a walk with his master; and the very distinct one of demand\r\nor supplication, as when wishing for a door or window to be opened.\r\n\r\nArticulate language is, however, peculiar to man; but he uses in common\r\nwith the lower animals inarticulate cries to express his meaning, aided\r\nby gestures and the movements of the muscles of the face.[76] This\r\nespecially holds good with the more simple and vivid feelings, which are\r\nbut little connected with our higher intelligence. Our cries of pain,\r\nfear, surprise, anger, together with their appropriate actions, and the\r\nmurmur of a mother to her beloved child, are more expressive than any\r\nwords. It is not the mere power of articulation that distinguishes man\r\nfrom other animals, for as every one knows, parrots can talk; but it is\r\nhis large power of connecting definite sounds with definite ideas; and\r\nthis obviously depends on the development of the mental faculties.\r\n\r\nAs Horne Tooke, one of the founders of the noble science of philology,\r\nobserves, language is an art, like brewing or baking; but writing would\r\nhave been a much more appropriate simile. It certainly is not a true\r\ninstinct, as every language has to be learnt. It differs, however,\r\nwidely from all ordinary arts, for man has an instinctive tendency to\r\nspeak, as we see in the babble of our young children; whilst no child\r\nhas an instinctive tendency to brew, bake, or write. Moreover, no\r\nphilologist now supposes that any language has been deliberately\r\ninvented; each has been slowly and unconsciously developed by many\r\nsteps. The sounds uttered by birds offer in several respects the nearest\r\nanalogy to language, for all the members of the same species utter the\r\nsame instinctive cries expressive of their emotions; and all the kinds\r\nthat have the power of singing exert this power instinctively; but the\r\nactual song, and even the call-notes, are learnt from their parents or\r\nfoster-parents. These sounds, as Daines Barrington[77] has proved, \"are\r\nno more innate than language is in man.\" The first attempts to sing \"may\r\nbe compared to the imperfect endeavour in a child to babble.\" The young\r\nmales continue practising, or, as the bird-catchers say, recording, for\r\nten or eleven months. Their first essays show hardly a rudiment of the\r\nfuture song; but as they grow older we can perceive what they are aiming\r\nat; and at last they are said \"to sing their song round.\" Nestlings\r\nwhich have learnt the song of a distinct species, as with the\r\ncanary-birds educated in the Tyrol, teach and transmit their new song to\r\ntheir offspring. The slight natural differences of song in the same\r\nspecies inhabiting different districts may be appositely compared, as\r\nBarrington remarks, \"to provincial dialects;\" and the songs of allied,\r\nthough distinct species may be compared with the languages of distinct\r\nraces of man. I have given the foregoing details to shew that an\r\ninstinctive tendency to acquire an art is not a peculiarity confined to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of articulate language, after having read on\r\nthe one side the highly interesting works of Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood, the\r\nRev. F. Farrar, and Prof. Schleicher,[78] and the celebrated lectures of\r\nProf. Max Mueller on the other side, I cannot doubt that language owes\r\nits origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and\r\ngestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and\r\nman's own instinctive cries. When we treat of sexual selection we shall\r\nsee that primeval man, or rather some early progenitor of man, probably\r\nused his voice largely, as does one of the gibbon-apes at the present\r\nday, in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing; we may\r\nconclude from a widely-spread analogy that this power would have been\r\nespecially exerted during the courtship of the sexes, serving to express\r\nvarious emotions, as love, jealousy, triumph, and serving as a challenge\r\nto their rivals. The imitation by articulate sounds of musical cries\r\nmight have given rise to words expressive of various complex emotions.\r\nAs bearing on the subject of imitation, the strong tendency in our\r\nnearest allies, the monkeys, in microcephalous idiots,[79] and in the\r\nbarbarous races of mankind, to imitate whatever they hear deserves\r\nnotice. As monkeys certainly understand much that is said to them by\r\nman, and as in a state of nature they utter signal-cries of danger to\r\ntheir fellows,[80] it does not appear altogether incredible, that some\r\nunusually wise ape-like animal should have thought of imitating the\r\ngrowl of a beast of prey, so as to indicate to his fellow monkeys the\r\nnature of the expected danger. And this would have been a first step in\r\nthe formation of a language.\r\n\r\nAs the voice was used more and more, the vocal organs would have been\r\nstrengthened and perfected through the principle of the inherited\r\neffects of use; and this would have reacted on the power of speech. But\r\nthe relation between the continued use of language and the development\r\nof the brain has no doubt been far more important. The mental powers in\r\nsome early progenitor of man must have been more highly developed than\r\nin any existing ape, before even the most imperfect form of speech could\r\nhave come into use; but we may confidently believe that the continued\r\nuse and advancement of this power would have reacted on the mind by\r\nenabling and encouraging it to carry on long trains of thought. A long\r\nand complex train of thought can no more be carried on without the aid\r\nof words, whether spoken or silent, than a long calculation without the\r\nuse of figures or algebra. It appears, also, that even ordinary trains\r\nof thought almost require some form of language, for the dumb, deaf, and\r\nblind girl, Laura Bridgman, was observed to use her fingers whilst\r\ndreaming.[81] Nevertheless a long succession of vivid and connected\r\nideas, may pass through the mind without the aid of any form of\r\nlanguage, as we may infer from the prolonged dreams of dogs. We have,\r\nalso, seen that retriever-dogs are able to reason to a certain extent;\r\nand this they manifestly do without the aid of language. The intimate\r\nconnection between the brain, as it is now developed in us, and the\r\nfaculty of speech, is well shewn by those curious cases of\r\nbrain-disease, in which speech is specially affected, as when the power\r\nto remember substantives is lost, whilst other words can be correctly\r\nused.[82] There is no more improbability in the effects of the continued\r\nuse of the vocal and mental organs being inherited, than in the case of\r\nhandwriting, which depends partly on the structure of the hand and\r\npartly on the disposition of the mind; and handwriting is certainly\r\ninherited.[83]\r\n\r\nWhy the organs now used for speech should have been originally perfected\r\nfor this purpose, rather than any other organs, it is not difficult to\r\nsee. Ants have considerable powers of intercommunication by means of\r\ntheir antennae, as shewn by Huber, who devotes a whole chapter to their\r\nlanguage. We might have used our fingers as efficient instruments, for a\r\nperson with practice can report to a deaf man every word of a speech\r\nrapidly delivered at a public meeting; but the loss of our hands, whilst\r\nthus employed, would have been a serious inconvenience. As all the\r\nhigher mammals possess vocal organs constructed on the same general\r\nplan with ours, and which are used as a means of communication, it was\r\nobviously probable, if the power of communication had to be improved,\r\nthat these same organs would have been still further developed; and this\r\nhas been effected by the aid of adjoining and well-adapted parts, namely\r\nthe tongue and lips.[84] The fact of the higher apes not using their\r\nvocal organs for speech, no doubt depends on their intelligence not\r\nhaving been sufficiently advanced. The possession by them of organs,\r\nwhich with long-continued practice might have been used for speech,\r\nalthough not thus used, is paralleled by the case of many birds which\r\npossess organs fitted for singing, though they never sing. Thus, the\r\nnightingale and crow have vocal organs similarly constructed, these\r\nbeing used by the former for diversified song, and by the latter merely\r\nfor croaking.[85]\r\n\r\nThe formation of different languages and of distinct species, and the\r\nproofs that both have been developed through a gradual process, are\r\ncuriously the same.[86] But we can trace the origin of many words\r\nfurther back than in the case of species, for we can perceive that they\r\nhave arisen from the imitation of various sounds, as in alliterative\r\npoetry. We find in distinct languages striking homologies due to\r\ncommunity of descent, and analogies due to a similar process of\r\nformation. The manner in which certain letters or sounds change when\r\nothers change is very like correlated growth. We have in both cases the\r\nreduplication of parts, the effects of long-continued use, and so forth.\r\nThe frequent presence of rudiments, both in languages and in species, is\r\nstill more remarkable. The letter _m_ in the word _am_, means _I_; so\r\nthat in the expression _I am_, a superfluous and useless rudiment has\r\nbeen retained. In the spelling also of words, letters often remain as\r\nthe rudiments of ancient forms of pronunciation. Languages, like organic\r\nbeings, can be classed in groups under groups; and they can be classed\r\neither naturally according to descent, or artificially by other\r\ncharacters. Dominant languages and dialects spread widely and lead to\r\nthe gradual extinction of other tongues. A language, like a species,\r\nwhen once extinct, never, as Sir C. Lyell remarks, reappears. The same\r\nlanguage never has two birthplaces. Distinct languages may be crossed\r\nor blended together.[87] We see variability in every tongue, and new\r\nwords are continually cropping up; but as there is a limit to the powers\r\nof the memory, single words, like whole languages, gradually become\r\nextinct. As Max Mueller[88] has well remarked:--\"A struggle for life is\r\nconstantly going on amongst the words and grammatical forms in each\r\nlanguage. The better, the shorter, the easier forms are constantly\r\ngaining the upper hand, and they owe their success to their own inherent\r\nvirtue.\" To these more important causes of the survival of certain\r\nwords, mere novelty may, I think, be added; for there is in the mind of\r\nman a strong love for slight changes in all things. The survival or\r\npreservation of certain favoured words in the struggle for existence is\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nThe perfectly regular and wonderfully complex construction of the\r\nlanguages of many barbarous nations has often been advanced as a proof,\r\neither of the divine origin of these languages, or of the high art and\r\nformer civilisation of their founders. Thus F. von Schlegel writes: \"In\r\nthose languages which appear to be at the lowest grade of intellectual\r\nculture, we frequently observe a very high and elaborate degree of art\r\nin their grammatical structure. This is especially the case with the\r\nBasque and the Lapponian, and many of the American languages.\"[89] But\r\nit is assuredly an error to speak of any language as an art in the sense\r\nof its having been elaborately and methodically formed. Philologists now\r\nadmit that conjugations, declensions, &c., originally existed as\r\ndistinct words, since joined together; and as such words express the\r\nmost obvious relations between objects and persons, it is not surprising\r\nthat they should have been used by the men of most races during the\r\nearliest ages. With respect to perfection, the following illustration\r\nwill best shew how easily we may err: a Crinoid sometimes consists of no\r\nless than 150,000 pieces of shell,[90] all arranged with perfect\r\nsymmetry in radiating lines; but a naturalist does not consider an\r\nanimal of this kind as more perfect than a bilateral one with\r\ncomparatively few parts, and with none of these alike, excepting on the\r\nopposite sides of the body. He justly considers the differentiation and\r\nspecialisation of organs as the test of perfection. So with languages,\r\nthe most symmetrical and complex ought not to be ranked above irregular,\r\nabbreviated, and bastardised languages, which have borrowed expressive\r\nwords and useful forms of construction from various conquering, or\r\nconquered, or immigrant races.\r\n\r\nFrom these few and imperfect remarks I conclude that the extremely\r\ncomplex and regular construction of many barbarous languages, is no\r\nproof that they owe their origin to a special act of creation.[91] Nor,\r\nas we have seen, does the faculty of articulate speech in itself offer\r\nany insuperable objection to the belief that man has been developed from\r\nsome lower form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Self-consciousness, Individuality, Abstraction, General Ideas, &c._--It\r\nwould be useless to attempt discussing these high faculties, which,\r\naccording to several recent writers, make the sole and complete\r\ndistinction between man and the brutes, for hardly two authors agree in\r\ntheir definitions. Such faculties could not have been fully developed in\r\nman until his mental powers had advanced to a high standard, and this\r\nimplies the use of a perfect language. No one supposes that one of the\r\nlower animals reflects whence he comes or whither he goes,--what is\r\ndeath or what is life, and so forth. But can we feel sure that an old\r\ndog with an excellent memory and some power of imagination, as shewn by\r\nhis dreams, never reflects on his past pleasures in the chase? and this\r\nwould be a form of self-consciousness. On the other hand, as Buechner[92]\r\nhas remarked, how little can the hard-worked wife of a degraded\r\nAustralian savage, who uses hardly any abstract words and cannot count\r\nabove four, exert her self-consciousness, or reflect on the nature of\r\nher own existence.\r\n\r\nThat animals retain their mental individuality is unquestionable. When\r\nmy voice awakened a train of old associations in the mind of the\r\nabove-mentioned dog, he must have retained his mental individuality,\r\nalthough every atom of his brain had probably undergone change more than\r\nonce during the interval of five years. This dog might have brought\r\nforward the argument lately advanced to crush all evolutionists, and\r\nsaid, \"I abide amid all mental moods and all material changes.... The\r\nteaching that atoms leave their impressions as legacies to other atoms\r\nfalling into the places they have vacated is contradictory of the\r\nutterance of consciousness, and is therefore false; but it is the\r\nteaching necessitated by evolutionism, consequently the hypothesis is a\r\nfalse one.\"[93]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sense of Beauty._--This sense has been declared to be peculiar to man.\r\nBut when we behold male birds elaborately displaying their plumes and\r\nsplendid colours before the females, whilst other birds not thus\r\ndecorated make no such display, it is impossible to doubt that the\r\nfemales admire the beauty of their male partners. As women everywhere\r\ndeck themselves with these plumes, the beauty of such ornaments cannot\r\nbe disputed. The Bower-birds by tastefully ornamenting their\r\nplaying-passages with gaily-coloured objects, as do certain\r\nhumming-birds their nests, offer additional evidence that they possess a\r\nsense of beauty. So with the song of birds, the sweet strains poured\r\nforth by the males during the season of love are certainly admired by\r\nthe females, of which fact evidence will hereafter be given. If female\r\nbirds had been incapable of appreciating the beautiful colours, the\r\nornaments, and voices of their male partners, all the labour and\r\nanxiety exhibited by them in displaying their charms before the females\r\nwould have been thrown away; and this it is impossible to admit. Why\r\ncertain bright colours and certain sounds should excite pleasure, when\r\nin harmony, cannot, I presume, be explained any more than why certain\r\nflavours and scents are agreeable; but assuredly the same colours and\r\nthe same sounds are admired by us and by many of the lower animals.\r\n\r\nThe taste for the beautiful, at least as far as female beauty is\r\nconcerned, is not of a special nature in the human mind; for it differs\r\nwidely in the different races of man, as will hereafter be shewn, and is\r\nnot quite the same even in the different nations of the same race.\r\nJudging from the hideous ornaments and the equally hideous music admired\r\nby most savages, it might be urged that their aesthetic faculty was not\r\nso highly developed as in certain animals, for instance, in birds.\r\nObviously no animal would be capable of admiring such scenes as the\r\nheavens at night, a beautiful landscape, or refined music; but such high\r\ntastes, depending as they do on culture and complex associations, are\r\nnot enjoyed by barbarians or by uneducated persons.\r\n\r\nMany of the faculties, which have been of inestimable service to man for\r\nhis progressive advancement, such as the powers of the imagination,\r\nwonder, curiosity, an undefined sense of beauty, a tendency to\r\nimitation, and the love of excitement or novelty, could not fail to have\r\nled to the most capricious changes of customs and fashions. I have\r\nalluded to this point, because a recent writer[94] has oddly fixed on\r\nCaprice \"as one of the most remarkable and typical differences between\r\nsavages and brutes.\" But not only can we perceive how it is that roan is\r\ncapricious, but the lower animals are, as we shall hereafter see,\r\ncapricious in their affections, aversions, and sense of beauty. There is\r\nalso good reason to suspect that they love novelty, for its own sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Belief in God--Religion._--There is no evidence that man was\r\naboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence of an\r\nOmnipotent God. On the contrary there is ample evidence, derived not\r\nfrom hasty travellers, but from men who have long resided with savages,\r\nthat numerous races have existed and still exist, who have no idea of\r\none or more gods, and who have no words in their languages to express\r\nsuch an idea.[95] The question is of course wholly distinct from that\r\nhigher one, whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe;\r\nand this has been answered in the affirmative by the highest intellects\r\nthat have ever lived.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we include under the term \"religion\" the belief in unseen\r\nor spiritual agencies, the case is wholly different; for this belief\r\nseems to be almost universal with the less civilised races. Nor is it\r\ndifficult to comprehend how it arose. As soon as the important faculties\r\nof the imagination, wonder, and curiosity, together with some power of\r\nreasoning, had become partially developed, man would naturally have\r\ncraved to understand what was passing around him, and have vaguely\r\nspeculated on his own existence. As Mr. M'Lennan[96] has remarked,\r\n\"Some explanation of the phenomena of life, a man must feign for\r\nhimself; and to judge from the universality of it, the simplest\r\nhypothesis, and the first to occur to men, seems to have been that\r\nnatural phenomena are ascribable to the presence in animals, plants, and\r\nthings, and in the forces of nature, of such spirits prompting to action\r\nas men are conscious they themselves possess.\" It is probable, as Mr.\r\nTylor has clearly shewn, that dreams may have first given rise to the\r\nnotion of spirits; for savages do not readily distinguish between\r\nsubjective and objective impressions. When a savage dreams, the figures\r\nwhich appear before him are believed to have come from a distance and to\r\nstand over him; or \"the soul of the dreamer goes out on its travels, and\r\ncomes home with a remembrance of what it has seen.\"[97] But until the\r\nabove-named faculties of imagination, curiosity, reason, &c., had been\r\nfairly well developed in the mind of man, his dreams would not have led\r\nhim to believe in spirits, any more than in the case of a dog.\r\n\r\nThe tendency in savages to imagine that natural objects and agencies\r\nare animated by spiritual or living essences, is perhaps illustrated by\r\na little fact which I once noticed: my dog, a full-grown and very\r\nsensible animal, was lying on the lawn during a hot and still day; but\r\nat a little distance a slight breeze occasionally moved an open parasol,\r\nwhich would have been wholly disregarded by the dog, had any one stood\r\nnear it. As it was, every time that the parasol slightly moved, the dog\r\ngrowled fiercely and barked. He must, I think, have reasoned to himself\r\nin a rapid and unconscious manner, that movement without any apparent\r\ncause indicated the presence of some strange living agent, and no\r\nstranger had a right to be on his territory.\r\n\r\nThe belief in spiritual agencies would easily pass into the belief in\r\nthe existence of one or more gods. For savages would naturally attribute\r\nto spirits the same passions, the same love of vengeance or simplest\r\nform of justice, and the same affections which they themselves\r\nexperienced. The Fuegians appear to be in this respect in an\r\nintermediate condition, for when the surgeon on board the \"Beagle\" shot\r\nsome young ducklings as specimens, York Minster declared in the most\r\nsolemn manner, \"Oh! Mr. Bynoe, much rain, much snow, blow much;\" and\r\nthis was evidently a retributive punishment for wasting human food. So\r\nagain he related how, when his brother killed a \"wild man,\" storms long\r\nraged, much rain and snow fell. Yet we could never discover that the\r\nFuegians believed in what we should call a God, or practised any\r\nreligious rites; and Jemmy Button, with justifiable pride, stoutly\r\nmaintained that there was no devil in his land. This latter assertion is\r\nthe more remarkable, as with savages the belief in bad spirits is far\r\nmore common than the belief in good spirits.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of religious devotion is a highly complex one, consisting of\r\nlove, complete submission to an exalted and mysterious superior, a\r\nstrong sense of dependence,[98] fear, reverence, gratitude, hope for the\r\nfuture, and perhaps other elements. No being could experience so complex\r\nan emotion until advanced in his intellectual and moral faculties to at\r\nleast a moderately high level. Nevertheless we see some distant approach\r\nto this state of mind, in the deep love of a dog for his master,\r\nassociated with complete submission, some fear, and perhaps other\r\nfeelings. The behaviour of a dog when returning to his master after an\r\nabsence, and, as I may add, of a monkey to his beloved keeper, is widely\r\ndifferent from that towards their fellows. In the latter case the\r\ntransports of joy appear to be somewhat less, and the sense of equality\r\nis shewn in every action. Professor Braubach[99] goes so far as to\r\nmaintain that a dog looks on his master as on a god.\r\n\r\nThe same high mental faculties which first led man to believe in unseen\r\nspiritual agencies, then in fetishism, polytheism, and ultimately in\r\nmonotheism, would infallibly lead him, as long as his reasoning powers\r\nremained poorly developed, to various strange superstitions and customs.\r\nMany of these are terrible to think of--such as the sacrifice of human\r\nbeings to a blood-loving god; the trial of innocent persons by the\r\nordeal of poison or fire; witchcraft, &c.--yet it is well occasionally\r\nto reflect on these superstitions, for they shew us what an infinite\r\ndebt of gratitude we owe to the improvement of our reason, to science,\r\nand our accumulated knowledge.[100] As Sir J. Lubbock has well\r\nobserved, \"it is not too much to say that the horrible dread of unknown\r\nevil hangs like a thick cloud over savage life, and embitters every\r\npleasure.\" These miserable and indirect consequences of our highest\r\nfaculties may be compared with the incidental and occasional mistakes of\r\nthe instincts of the lower animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE MENTAL POWERS OF MAN AND THE LOWER\r\nANIMALS--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The moral sense--Fundamental proposition--The qualities of\r\n  social animals--Origin of sociability--Struggle between opposed\r\n  instincts--Man a social animal--The more enduring social\r\n  instincts conquer other less persistent instincts--The social\r\n  virtues alone regarded by savages--The self-regarding virtues\r\n  acquired at a later stage of development--The importance of the\r\n  judgment of the members of the same community on\r\n  conduct--Transmission of moral tendencies--Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nI fully subscribe to the judgment of those writers[101] who maintain\r\nthat of all the differences between man and the lower animals, the moral\r\nsense or conscience is by far the most important. This sense, as\r\nMackintosh[102] remarks, \"has a rightful supremacy over every other\r\nprinciple of human action;\" it is summed up in that short but imperious\r\nword _ought_, so full of high significance. It is the most noble of all\r\nthe attributes of man, leading him without a moment's hesitation to risk\r\nhis life for that of a fellow-creature; or after due deliberation,\r\nimpelled simply by the deep feeling of right or duty, to sacrifice it in\r\nsome great cause. Immanuel Kant exclaims, \"Duty! Wondrous thought, that\r\nworkest neither by fond insinuation, flattery, nor by any threat, but\r\nmerely by holding up thy naked law in the soul, and so extorting for\r\nthyself always reverence, if not always obedience; before whom all\r\nappetites are dumb, however secretly they rebel; whence thy\r\noriginal?\"[103]\r\n\r\nThis great question has been discussed by many writers[104] of\r\nconsummate ability; and my sole excuse for touching on it is the\r\nimpossibility of here passing it over, and because, as far as I know, no\r\none has approached it exclusively from the side of natural history. The\r\ninvestigation possesses, also, some independent interest, as an attempt\r\nto see how far the study of the lower animals can throw light on one of\r\nthe highest psychical faculties of man.\r\n\r\nThe following proposition seems to me in a high degree probable--namely,\r\nthat any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social\r\ninstincts,[105] would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as\r\nsoon as its intellectual powers had become as well developed, or nearly\r\nas well developed, as in man. For, _firstly_, the social instincts lead\r\nan animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a\r\ncertain amount of sympathy with them, and to perform various services\r\nfor them. The services may be of a definite and evidently instinctive\r\nnature; or there may be only a wish and readiness, as with most of the\r\nhigher social animals, to aid their fellows in certain general ways. But\r\nthese feelings and services are by no means extended to all the\r\nindividuals of the same species, only to those of the same association.\r\n_Secondly_, as soon as the mental faculties had become highly developed,\r\nimages of all past actions and motives would be incessantly passing\r\nthrough the brain of each individual; and that feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction which invariably results, as we shall hereafter see,\r\nfrom any unsatisfied instinct, would arise, as often as it was perceived\r\nthat the enduring and always present social instinct had yielded to some\r\nother instinct, at the time stronger, but neither enduring in its\r\nnature, nor leaving behind it a very vivid impression. It is clear that\r\nmany instinctive desires, such as that of hunger, are in their nature of\r\nshort duration; and after being satisfied are not readily or vividly\r\nrecalled. _Thirdly_, after the power of language had been acquired and\r\nthe wishes of the members of the same community could be distinctly\r\nexpressed, the common opinion how each member ought to act for the\r\npublic good, would naturally become to a large extent the guide to\r\naction. But the social instincts would still give the impulse to act for\r\nthe good of the community, this impulse being strengthened, directed,\r\nand sometimes even deflected by public opinion, the power of which\r\nrests, as we shall presently see, on instinctive sympathy. _Lastly_,\r\nhabit in the individual would ultimately play a very important part in\r\nguiding the conduct of each member; for the social instincts and\r\nimpulses, like all other instincts, would be greatly strengthened by\r\nhabit, as would obedience to the wishes and judgment of the community.\r\nThese several subordinate propositions must now be discussed; and some\r\nof them at considerable length.\r\n\r\nIt may be well first to premise that I do not wish to maintain that any\r\nstrictly social animal, if its intellectual faculties were to become as\r\nactive and as highly developed as in man, would acquire exactly the same\r\nmoral sense as ours. In the same manner as various animals have some\r\nsense of beauty, though they admire widely different objects, so they\r\nmight have a sense of right and wrong, though led by it to follow widely\r\ndifferent lines of conduct. If, for instance, to take an extreme case,\r\nmen were reared under precisely the same conditions as hive-bees, there\r\ncan hardly be a doubt that our unmarried females would, like the\r\nworker-bees, think it a sacred duty to kill their brothers, and mothers\r\nwould strive to kill their fertile daughters; and no one would think of\r\ninterfering. Nevertheless the bee, or any other social animal, would in\r\nour supposed case gain, as it appears to me, some feeling of right and\r\nwrong, or a conscience. For each individual would have an inward sense\r\nof possessing certain stronger or more enduring instincts, and others\r\nless strong or enduring; so that there would often be a struggle which\r\nimpulse should be followed; and satisfaction or dissatisfaction would be\r\nfelt, as past impressions were compared during their incessant passage\r\nthrough the mind. In this case an inward monitor would tell the animal\r\nthat it would have been better to have followed the one impulse rather\r\nthan the other. The one course ought to have been followed: the one\r\nwould have been right and the other wrong; but to these terms I shall\r\nhave to recur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sociability._--Animals of many kinds are social; we find even distinct\r\nspecies living together, as with some American monkeys, and with the\r\nunited flocks of rooks, jackdaws, and starlings. Man shows the same\r\nfeeling in his strong love for the dog, which the dog returns with\r\ninterest. Every one must have noticed how miserable horses, dogs, sheep,\r\n&c. are when separated from their companions; and what affection at\r\nleast the two former kinds show on their reunion. It is curious to\r\nspeculate on the feelings of a dog, who will rest peacefully for hours\r\nin a room with his master or any of the family, without the least notice\r\nbeing taken of him; but if left for a short time by himself, barks or\r\nhowls dismally. We will confine our attention to the higher social\r\nanimals, excluding insects, although these aid each other in many\r\nimportant ways. The most common service which the higher animals perform\r\nfor each other, is the warning each other of danger by means of the\r\nunited senses of all. Every sportsman knows, as Dr. Jaeger remarks,[106]\r\nhow difficult it is to approach animals in a herd or troop. Wild horses\r\nand cattle do not, I believe, make any danger-signal; but the attitude\r\nof any one who first discovers an enemy, warns the others. Rabbits stamp\r\nloudly on the ground with their hind-feet as a signal: sheep and chamois\r\ndo the same, but with their fore-feet, uttering likewise a whistle. Many\r\nbirds and some mammals post sentinels, which in the case of seals are\r\nsaid[107] generally to be the females. The leader of a troop of monkeys\r\nacts as the sentinel, and utters cries expressive both of danger and of\r\nsafety.[108] Social animals perform many little services for each\r\nother: horses nibble, and cows lick each other, on any spot which\r\nitches: monkeys search for each other's external parasites; and Brehm\r\nstates that after a troop of the _Cercopithecus griseo-viridis_ has\r\nrushed through a thorny brake, each monkey stretches itself on a branch,\r\nand another monkey sitting by \"conscientiously\" examines its fur and\r\nextracts every thorn or burr.\r\n\r\nAnimals also render more important services to each other: thus wolves\r\nand some other beasts of prey hunt in packs, and aid each other in\r\nattacking their victims. Pelicans fish in concert. The Hamadryas baboons\r\nturn over stones to find insects, &c.; and when they come to a large\r\none, as many as can stand round, turn it over together and share the\r\nbooty. Social animals mutually defend each other. The males of some\r\nruminants come to the front when there is danger and defend the herd\r\nwith their horns. I shall also in a future chapter give cases of two\r\nyoung wild bulls attacking an old one in concert, and of two stallions\r\ntogether trying to drive away a third stallion from a troop of mares.\r\nBrehm encountered in Abyssinia a great troop of baboons which were\r\ncrossing a valley: some had already ascended the opposite mountain, and\r\nsome were still in the valley: the latter were attacked by the dogs, but\r\nthe old males immediately hurried down from the rocks, and with mouths\r\nwidely opened roared so fearfully, that the dogs precipitately\r\nretreated. They were again encouraged to the attack; but by this time\r\nall the baboons had reascended the heights, excepting a young one, about\r\nsix months old, who, loudly calling for aid, climbed on a block of rock\r\nand was surrounded. Now one of the largest males, a true hero, came down\r\nagain from the mountain, slowly went to the young one, coaxed him, and\r\ntriumphantly led him away--the dogs being too much astonished to make an\r\nattack. I cannot resist giving another scene which was witnessed by this\r\nsame naturalist; an eagle seized a young Cercopithecus, which, by\r\nclinging to a branch, was not at once carried off; it cried loudly for\r\nassistance, upon which the other members of the troop with much uproar\r\nrushed to the rescue, surrounded the eagle, and pulled out so many\r\nfeathers, that he no longer thought of his prey, but only how to escape.\r\nThis eagle, as Brehm remarks, assuredly would never again attack a\r\nmonkey in a troop.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that associated animals have a feeling of love for each\r\nother which is not felt by adult and non-social animals. How far in most\r\ncases they actually sympathise with each other's pains and pleasures is\r\nmore doubtful, especially with respect to the latter. Mr. Buxton,\r\nhowever, who had excellent means of observation,[109] states that his\r\nmacaws, which lived free in Norfolk, took \"an extravagant interest\" in a\r\npair with a nest, and whenever the female left it, she was surrounded by\r\na troop \"screaming horrible acclamations in her honour.\" It is often\r\ndifficult to judge whether animals have any feeling for each other's\r\nsufferings. Who can say what cows feel, when they surround and stare\r\nintently on a dying or dead companion? That animals sometimes are far\r\nfrom feeling any sympathy is too certain; for they will expel a wounded\r\nanimal from the herd, or gore or worry it to death. This is almost the\r\nblackest fact in natural history, unless indeed the explanation which\r\nhas been suggested is true, that their instinct or reason leads them to\r\nexpel an injured companion, lest beasts of prey, including man, should\r\nbe tempted to follow the troop. In this case their conduct is not much\r\nworse than that of the North American Indians who leave their feeble\r\ncomrades to perish on the plains, or the Feegeans, who, when their\r\nparents get old or fall ill, bury them alive.[110]\r\n\r\nMany animals, however, certainly sympathise with each other's distress\r\nor danger. This is the case even with birds; Capt. Stansbury[111] found\r\non a salt lake in Utah an old and completely blind pelican, which was\r\nvery fat, and must have been long and well fed by his companions. Mr.\r\nBlyth, as he informs me, saw Indian crows feeding two or three of their\r\ncompanions which were blind; and I have heard of an analogous case with\r\nthe domestic cock. We may, if we choose, call these actions instinctive;\r\nbut such cases are much too rare for the development of any special\r\ninstinct.[112] I have myself seen a dog, who never passed a great friend\r\nof his, a cat which lay sick in a basket, without giving her a few licks\r\nwith his tongue, the surest sign of kind feeling in a dog.\r\n\r\nIt must be called sympathy that leads a courageous dog to fly at any one\r\nwho strikes his master, as he certainly will. I saw a person pretending\r\nto beat a lady who had a very timid little dog on her lap, and the trial\r\nhad never before been made. The little creature instantly jumped away,\r\nbut after the pretended beating was over, it was really pathetic to see\r\nhow perseveringly he tried to lick his mistress's face and comfort her.\r\nBrehm[113] states that when a baboon in confinement was pursued to be\r\npunished, the others tried to protect him. It must have been sympathy in\r\nthe cases above given which led the baboons and Cercopitheci to defend\r\ntheir young comrades from the dogs and the eagle. I will give only one\r\nother instance of sympathetic and heroic conduct in a little American\r\nmonkey. Several years ago a keeper at the Zoological Gardens, showed me\r\nsome deep and scarcely healed wounds on the nape of his neck, inflicted\r\non him whilst kneeling on the floor by a fierce baboon. The little\r\nAmerican monkey, who was a warm friend of this keeper, lived in the same\r\nlarge compartment, and was dreadfully afraid of the great baboon.\r\nNevertheless, as soon as he saw his friend the keeper in peril, he\r\nrushed to the rescue, and by screams and bites so distracted the baboon\r\nthat the man was able to escape, after running great risk, as the\r\nsurgeon who attended him thought, of his life.\r\n\r\nBesides love and sympathy, animals exhibit other qualities which in us\r\nwould be called moral; and I agree with Agassiz[114] that dogs possess\r\nsomething very like a conscience. They certainly possess some power of\r\nself-command, and this does not appear to be wholly the result of fear.\r\nAs Braubach[115] remarks, a dog will refrain from stealing food in the\r\nabsence of his master. Dogs have long been accepted as the very type of\r\nfidelity and obedience. All animals living in a body which defend each\r\nother or attack their enemies in concert, must be in some degree\r\nfaithful to each other; and those that follow a leader must be in some\r\ndegree obedient. When the baboons in Abyssinia[116] plunder a garden,\r\nthey silently follow their leader; and if an imprudent young animal\r\nmakes a noise, he receives a slap from the others to teach him silence\r\nand obedience; but as soon as they are sure that there is no danger, all\r\nshow their joy by much clamour.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the impulse which leads certain animals to associate\r\ntogether, and to aid each other in many ways, we may infer that in most\r\ncases they are impelled by the same sense of satisfaction or pleasure\r\nwhich they experience in performing other instinctive actions; or by the\r\nsame sense of dissatisfaction, as in other cases of prevented\r\ninstinctive actions. We see this in innumerable instances, and it is\r\nillustrated in a striking manner by the acquired instincts of our\r\ndomesticated animals; thus a young shepherd-dog delights in driving and\r\nrunning round a flock of sheep, but not in worrying them; a young\r\nfoxhound delights in hunting a fox, whilst some other kinds of dogs as I\r\nhave witnessed, utterly disregard foxes. What a strong feeling of inward\r\nsatisfaction must impel a bird, so full of activity, to brood day after\r\nday over her eggs. Migratory birds are miserable if prevented from\r\nmigrating, and perhaps they enjoy starting on their long flight. Some\r\nfew instincts are determined solely by painful feelings, as by fear,\r\nwhich leads to self-preservation, or is specially directed against\r\ncertain enemies. No one, I presume, can analyse the sensations of\r\npleasure or pain. In many cases, however, it is probable that instincts\r\nare persistently followed from the mere force of inheritance, without\r\nthe stimulus of either pleasure or pain. A young pointer, when it first\r\nscents game, apparently cannot help pointing. A squirrel in a cage who\r\npats the nuts which it cannot eat, as if to bury them in the ground, can\r\nhardly be thought to act thus either from pleasure or pain. Hence the\r\ncommon assumption that men must be impelled to every action by\r\nexperiencing some pleasure or pain may be erroneous. Although a habit\r\nmay be blindly and implicitly followed, independently of any pleasure or\r\npain felt at the moment, yet if it be forcibly and abruptly checked, a\r\nvague sense of dissatisfaction is generally experienced; and this is\r\nespecially true in regard to persons of feeble intellect.\r\n\r\nIt has often been assumed that animals were in the first place rendered\r\nsocial, and that they feel as a consequence uncomfortable when separated\r\nfrom each other, and comfortable whilst together; but it is a more\r\nprobable view that these sensations were first developed, in order that\r\nthose animals which would profit by living in society, should be induced\r\nto live together. In the same manner as the sense of hunger and the\r\npleasure of eating were, no doubt, first acquired in order to induce\r\nanimals to eat. The feeling of pleasure from society is probably an\r\nextension of the parental or filial affections; and this extension may\r\nbe in chief part attributed to natural selection, but perhaps in part to\r\nmere habit. For with those animals which were benefited by living in\r\nclose association, the individuals which took the greatest pleasure in\r\nsociety would best escape various dangers; whilst those that cared least\r\nfor their comrades and lived solitary would perish in greater numbers.\r\nWith respect to the origin of the parental and filial affections, which\r\napparently lie at the basis of the social affections, it is hopeless to\r\nspeculate; but we may infer that they have been to a large extent\r\ngained through natural selection. So it has almost certainly been with\r\nthe unusual and opposite feeling of hatred between the nearest\r\nrelations, as with the worker-bees which kill their brother-drones, and\r\nwith the queen-bees which kill their daughter-queens; the desire to\r\ndestroy, instead of loving, their nearest relations having been here of\r\nservice to the community.\r\n\r\nThe all-important emotion of sympathy is distinct from that of love. A\r\nmother may passionately love her sleeping and passive infant, but she\r\ncan then hardly be said to feel sympathy for it. The love of a man for\r\nhis dog is distinct from sympathy, and so is that of a dog for his\r\nmaster. Adam Smith formerly argued, as has Mr. Bain recently, that the\r\nbasis of sympathy lies in our strong retentiveness of former states of\r\npain or pleasure. Hence, \"the sight of another person enduring hunger,\r\ncold, fatigue, revives in us some recollection of these states, which\r\nare painful even in idea.\" We are thus impelled to relieve the\r\nsufferings of another, in order that our own painful feelings may be at\r\nthe same time relieved. In like manner we are led to participate in the\r\npleasures of others.[117] But I cannot see how this view explains the\r\nfact that sympathy is excited in an immeasurably stronger degree by a\r\nbeloved than by an indifferent person. The mere sight of suffering,\r\nindependently of love, would suffice to call up in us vivid\r\nrecollections and associations. Sympathy may at first have originated in\r\nthe manner above suggested; but it seems now to have become an instinct,\r\nwhich is especially directed towards beloved objects, in the same manner\r\nas fear with animals is especially directed against certain enemies. As\r\nsympathy is thus directed, the mutual love of the members of the same\r\ncommunity will extend its limits. No doubt a tiger or lion feels\r\nsympathy for the sufferings of its own young, but not for any other\r\nanimal. With strictly social animals the feeling will be more or less\r\nextended to all the associated members, as we know to be the case. With\r\nmankind selfishness, experience, and imitation probably add, as Mr. Bain\r\nhas shewn, to the power of sympathy; for we are led by the hope of\r\nreceiving good in return to perform acts of sympathetic kindness to\r\nothers; and there can be no doubt that the feeling of sympathy is much\r\nstrengthened by habit. In however complex a manner this feeling may have\r\noriginated, as it is one of high importance to all those animals which\r\naid and defend each other, it will have been increased, through natural\r\nselection; for those communities, which included the greatest number of\r\nthe most sympathetic members, would flourish best and rear the greatest\r\nnumber of offspring.\r\n\r\nIn many cases it is impossible to decide whether certain social\r\ninstincts have been acquired through natural selection, or are the\r\nindirect result of other instincts and faculties, such as sympathy,\r\nreason, experience, and a tendency to imitation; or again, whether they\r\nare simply the result of long-continued habit. So remarkable an instinct\r\nas the placing sentinels to warn the community of danger, can hardly\r\nhave been the indirect result of any other faculty; it must therefore\r\nhave been directly acquired. On the other hand, the habit followed by\r\nthe males of some social animals, of defending the community and of\r\nattacking their enemies or their prey in concert, may perhaps have\r\noriginated from mutual sympathy; but courage, and in most cases\r\nstrength, must have been previously acquired, probably through natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nOf the various instincts and habits, some are much stronger than others,\r\nthat is, some either give more pleasure in their performance and more\r\ndistress in their prevention than others; or, which is probably quite as\r\nimportant, they are more persistently followed through inheritance\r\nwithout exciting any special feeling of pleasure or pain. We are\r\nourselves conscious that some habits are much more difficult to cure or\r\nchange than others. Hence a struggle may often be observed in animals\r\nbetween different instincts, or between an instinct and some habitual\r\ndisposition; as when a dog rushes after a hare, is rebuked, pauses,\r\nhesitates, pursues again or returns ashamed to his master; or as between\r\nthe love of a female dog for her young puppies and for her master, for\r\nshe may be seen to slink away to them, as if half ashamed of not\r\naccompanying her master. But the most curious instance known to me of\r\none instinct conquering another, is the migratory instinct conquering\r\nthe maternal instinct. The former is wonderfully strong; a confined bird\r\nwill at the proper season beat her breast against the wires of her cage,\r\nuntil it is bare and bloody. It causes young salmon to leap out of the\r\nfresh water, where they could still continue to live, and thus\r\nunintentionally to commit suicide. Every one knows how strong the\r\nmaternal instinct is, leading even timid birds to face great danger,\r\nthough with hesitation and in opposition to the instinct of\r\nself-preservation. Nevertheless the migratory instinct is so powerful\r\nthat late in the autumn swallows and house-martins frequently desert\r\ntheir tender young, leaving them to perish miserably in their\r\nnests.[118]\r\n\r\nWe can perceive that an instinctive impulse, if it be in any way more\r\nbeneficial to a species than some other or opposed instinct, would be\r\nrendered the more potent of the two through natural selection; for the\r\nindividuals which had it most strongly developed would survive in larger\r\nnumbers. Whether this is the case with the migratory in comparison with\r\nthe maternal instinct, may well be doubted. The great persistence or\r\nsteady action of the former at certain seasons of the year during the\r\nwhole day, may give it for a time paramount force.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Man a social animal._--Most persons admit that man is a social being.\r\nWe see this in his dislike of solitude, and in his wish for society\r\nbeyond that of his own family. Solitary confinement is one of the\r\nseverest punishments which can be inflicted. Some authors suppose that\r\nman primevally lived in single families; but at the present day, though\r\nsingle families, or only two or three together, roam the solitudes of\r\nsome savage lands, they are always, as far as I can discover, friendly\r\nwith other families inhabiting the same district. Such families\r\noccasionally meet in council, and they unite for their common defence.\r\nIt is no argument against savage man being a social animal, that the\r\ntribes inhabiting adjacent districts are almost always at war with each\r\nother; for the social instincts never extend to all the individuals of\r\nthe same species. Judging from the analogy of the greater number of the\r\nQuadrumana, it is probable that the early ape-like progenitors of man\r\nwere likewise social; but this is not of much importance for us.\r\nAlthough man, as he now exists, has few special instincts, having lost\r\nany which his early progenitors may have possessed, this is no reason\r\nwhy he should not have retained from an extremely remote period some\r\ndegree of instinctive love and sympathy for his fellows. We are indeed\r\nall conscious that we do possess such sympathetic feelings;[119] but our\r\nconsciousness does not tell us whether they are instinctive, having\r\noriginated long ago in the same manner as with the lower animals, or\r\nwhether they have been acquired by each of us during our early years. As\r\nman is a social animal, it is also probable that he would inherit a\r\ntendency to be faithful to his comrades, for this quality is common to\r\nmost social animals. He would in like manner possess some capacity for\r\nself-command, and perhaps of obedience to the leader of the community.\r\nHe would from an inherited tendency still be willing to defend, in\r\nconcert with others, his fellow-men, and would be ready to aid them in\r\nany way which did not too greatly interfere with his own welfare or his\r\nown strong desires.\r\n\r\nThe social animals which stand at the bottom of the scale are guided\r\nalmost exclusively, and those which stand higher in the scale are\r\nlargely guided, in the aid which they give to the members of the same\r\ncommunity, by special instincts; but they are likewise in part impelled\r\nby mutual love and sympathy, assisted apparently by some amount of\r\nreason. Although man, as just remarked, has no special instincts to tell\r\nhim how to aid his fellow-men, he still has the impulse, and with his\r\nimproved intellectual faculties would naturally be much guided in this\r\nrespect by reason and experience. Instinctive sympathy would, also,\r\ncause him to value highly the approbation of his fellow-men; for, as Mr.\r\nBain has clearly shewn,[120] the love of praise and the strong feeling\r\nof glory, and the still stronger horror of scorn and infamy, \"are due to\r\nthe workings of sympathy.\" Consequently man would be greatly influenced\r\nby the wishes, approbation, and blame of his fellow-men, as expressed by\r\ntheir gestures and language. Thus the social instincts, which must have\r\nbeen acquired by man in a very rude state, and probably even by his\r\nearly ape-like progenitors, still give the impulse to many of his best\r\nactions; but his actions are largely determined by the expressed wishes\r\nand judgment of his fellow-men, and unfortunately still oftener by his\r\nown strong, selfish desires. But as the feelings of love and sympathy\r\nand the power of self-command become strengthened by habit, and as the\r\npower of reasoning becomes clearer so that man can appreciate the\r\njustice of the judgments of his fellow-men, he will feel himself\r\nimpelled, independently of any pleasure or pain felt at the moment, to\r\ncertain lines of conduct. He may then say, I am the supreme judge of my\r\nown conduct, and in the words of Kant, I will not in my own person\r\nviolate the dignity of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The more enduring Social Instincts conquer the less Persistent\r\nInstincts._--We have, however, not as yet considered the main point, on\r\nwhich the whole question of the moral sense hinges. Why should a man\r\nfeel that he ought to obey one instinctive desire rather than another?\r\nWhy does he bitterly regret if he has yielded to the strong sense of\r\nself-preservation, and has not risked his life to save that of a\r\nfellow-creature; or why does he regret having stolen food from severe\r\nhunger?\r\n\r\nIt is evident in the first place, that with mankind the instinctive\r\nimpulses have different degrees of strength; a young and timid mother\r\nurged by the maternal instinct will, without a moment's hesitation, run\r\nthe greatest danger for her infant, but not for a mere fellow-creature.\r\nMany a man, or even boy, who never before risked his life for another,\r\nbut in whom courage and sympathy were well developed, has, disregarding\r\nthe instinct of self-preservation, instantaneously plunged into a\r\ntorrent to save a drowning fellow-creature. In this case man is impelled\r\nby the same instinctive motive, which caused the heroic little American\r\nmonkey, formerly described, to attack the great and dreaded baboon, to\r\nsave his keeper. Such actions as the above appear to be the simple\r\nresult of the greater strength of the social or maternal instincts than\r\nof any other instinct or motive; for they are performed too\r\ninstantaneously for reflection, or for the sensation of pleasure or\r\npain; though if prevented distress would be caused.\r\n\r\nI am aware that some persons maintain that actions performed\r\nimpulsively, as in the above cases, do not come under the dominion of\r\nthe moral sense, and cannot be called moral. They confine this term to\r\nactions done deliberately, after a victory over opposing desires, or to\r\nactions prompted by some lofty motive. But it appears scarcely possible\r\nto draw any clear line of distinction of this kind; though the\r\ndistinction may be real. As far as exalted motives are concerned, many\r\ninstances have been recorded of barbarians, destitute of any feeling of\r\ngeneral benevolence towards mankind, and not guided by any religious\r\nmotive, who have deliberately as prisoners sacrificed their lives,[121]\r\nrather than betray their comrades; and surely their conduct ought to be\r\nconsidered as moral. As far as deliberation and the victory over\r\nopposing motives are concerned, animals may be seen doubting between\r\nopposed instincts, as in rescuing their offspring or comrades from\r\ndanger; yet their actions, though done for the good of others, are not\r\ncalled moral. Moreover, an action repeatedly performed by us, will at\r\nlast be done without deliberation or hesitation, and can then hardly be\r\ndistinguished from an instinct; yet surely no one will pretend that an\r\naction thus done ceases to be moral. On the contrary, we all feel that\r\nan act cannot be considered as perfect, or as performed in the most\r\nnoble manner, unless it be done impulsively, without deliberation or\r\neffort, in the same manner as by a man in whom the requisite qualities\r\nare innate. He who is forced to overcome his fear or want of sympathy\r\nbefore he acts, deserves, however, in one way higher credit than the man\r\nwhose innate disposition leads him to a good act without effort. As we\r\ncannot distinguish between motives, we rank all actions of a certain\r\nclass as moral, when they are performed by a moral being. A moral being\r\nis one who is capable of comparing his past and future actions or\r\nmotives, and of approving or disapproving of them. We have no reason to\r\nsuppose that any of the lower animals have this capacity; therefore\r\nwhen a monkey faces danger to rescue its comrade, or takes charge of an\r\norphan-monkey, we do not call its conduct moral. But in the case of man,\r\nwho alone can with certainty be ranked as a moral being, actions of a\r\ncertain class are called moral, whether performed deliberately after a\r\nstruggle with opposing motives, or from the effects of slowly-gained\r\nhabit, or impulsively through instinct.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our more immediate subject; although some instincts are\r\nmore powerful than others, thus leading to corresponding actions, yet it\r\ncannot be maintained that the social instincts are ordinarily stronger\r\nin man, or have become stronger through long-continued habit, than the\r\ninstincts, for instance, of self-preservation, hunger, lust, vengeance,\r\n&c. Why then does man regret, even though he may endeavour to banish any\r\nsuch regret, that he has followed the one natural impulse, rather than\r\nthe other; and why does he further feel that he ought to regret his\r\nconduct? Man in this respect differs profoundly from the lower animals.\r\nNevertheless we can, I think, see with some degree of clearness the\r\nreason of this difference.\r\n\r\nMan, from the activity of his mental faculties, cannot avoid reflection:\r\npast impressions and images are incessantly passing through his mind\r\nwith distinctness. Now with those animals which live permanently in a\r\nbody, the social instincts are ever present and persistent. Such animals\r\nare always ready to utter the danger-signal, to defend the community,\r\nand to give aid to their fellows in accordance with their habits; they\r\nfeel at all times, without the stimulus of any special passion or\r\ndesire, some degree of love and sympathy for them; they are unhappy if\r\nlong separated from them, and always happy to be in their company. So it\r\nis with ourselves. A man who possessed no trace of such feelings would\r\nbe an unnatural monster. On the other hand, the desire to satisfy\r\nhunger, or any passion, such as vengeance, is in its nature temporary,\r\nand can for a time be fully satisfied. Nor is it easy, perhaps hardly\r\npossible, to call up with complete vividness the feeling, for instance,\r\nof hunger; nor indeed, as has often been remarked, of any suffering. The\r\ninstinct of self-preservation is not felt except in the presence of\r\ndanger; and many a coward has thought himself brave until he has met his\r\nenemy face to face. The wish for another man's property is perhaps as\r\npersistent a desire as any that can be named; but even in this case the\r\nsatisfaction of actual possession is generally a weaker feeling than the\r\ndesire: many a thief, if not an habitual one, after success has wondered\r\nwhy he stole some article.\r\n\r\nThus, as man cannot prevent old impressions continually repassing\r\nthrough his mind, he will be compelled to compare the weaker impressions\r\nof, for instance, past hunger, or of vengeance satisfied or danger\r\navoided at the cost of other men, with the instinct of sympathy and\r\ngood-will to his fellows, which is still present and ever in some degree\r\nactive in his mind. He will then feel in his imagination that a stronger\r\ninstinct has yielded to one which now seems comparatively weak; and then\r\nthat sense of dissatisfaction will inevitably be felt with which man is\r\nendowed, like every other animal, in order that his instincts may be\r\nobeyed. The case before given, of the swallow, affords an illustration,\r\nthough of a reversed nature, of a temporary though for the time strongly\r\npersistent instinct conquering another instinct which is usually\r\ndominant over all others. At the proper season these birds seem all day\r\nlong to be impressed with the desire to migrate; their habits change;\r\nthey become restless, are noisy, and congregate in flocks. Whilst the\r\nmother-bird is feeding or brooding over her nestlings, the maternal\r\ninstinct is probably stronger than the migratory; but the instinct which\r\nis more persistent gains the victory, and at last, at a moment when her\r\nyoung ones are not in sight, she takes flight and deserts them. When\r\narrived at the end of her long journey, and the migratory instinct\r\nceases to act, what an agony of remorse each bird would feel, if, from\r\nbeing endowed with great mental activity, she could not prevent the\r\nimage continually passing before her mind of her young ones perishing in\r\nthe bleak north from cold and hunger.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of action, man will no doubt be apt to follow the stronger\r\nimpulse; and though this may occasionally prompt him to the noblest\r\ndeeds, it will far more commonly lead him to gratify his own desires at\r\nthe expense of other men. But after their gratification, when past and\r\nweaker impressions are contrasted with the ever-enduring social\r\ninstincts, retribution will surely come. Man will then feel dissatisfied\r\nwith himself, and will resolve with more or less force to act\r\ndifferently for the future. This is conscience; for conscience looks\r\nbackwards and judges past actions, inducing that kind of\r\ndissatisfaction, which if weak we call regret, and if severe remorse.\r\n\r\nThese sensations are, no doubt, different from those experienced when\r\nother instincts or desires are left unsatisfied; but every unsatisfied\r\ninstinct has its own proper prompting sensation, as we recognise with\r\nhunger, thirst, &c. Man thus prompted, will through long habit acquire\r\nsuch perfect self-command, that his desires and passions will at last\r\ninstantly yield to his social sympathies, and there will no longer be a\r\nstruggle between them. The still hungry, or the still revengeful man\r\nwill not think of stealing food, or of wreaking his vengeance. It is\r\npossible, or, as we shall hereafter see, even probable, that the habit\r\nof self-command may, like other habits, be inherited. Thus at last man\r\ncomes to feel, through acquired and perhaps inherited habit, that it is\r\nbest for him to obey his more persistent instincts. The imperious word\r\n_ought_ seems merely to imply the consciousness of the existence of a\r\npersistent instinct, either innate or partly acquired, serving him as a\r\nguide, though liable to be disobeyed. We hardly use the word _ought_ in\r\na metaphorical sense, when we say hounds ought to hunt, pointers to\r\npoint, and retrievers to retrieve their game. If they fail thus to act,\r\nthey fail in their duty and act wrongly.\r\n\r\nIf any desire or instinct, leading to an action opposed to the good of\r\nothers, still appears to a man, when recalled to mind, as strong as, or\r\nstronger than, his social instinct, he will feel no keen regret at\r\nhaving followed it; but he will be conscious that if his conduct were\r\nknown to his fellows, it would meet with their disapprobation; and few\r\nare so destitute of sympathy as not to feel discomfort when this is\r\nrealised. If he has no such sympathy, and if his desires leading to bad\r\nactions are at the time strong, and when recalled are not overmastered\r\nby the persistent social instincts, then he is essentially a bad\r\nman;[122] and the sole restraining motive left is the fear of\r\npunishment, and the conviction that in the long run it would be best for\r\nhis own selfish interests to regard the good of others rather than his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that every one may with an easy conscience gratify his own\r\ndesires, if they do not interfere with his social instincts, that is\r\nwith the good of others; but in order to be quite free from\r\nself-reproach, or at least of anxiety, it is almost necessary for him to\r\navoid the disapprobation, whether reasonable or not, of his fellow men.\r\nNor must he break through the fixed habits of his life, especially if\r\nthese are supported by reason; for if he does, he will assuredly feel\r\ndissatisfaction. He must likewise avoid the reprobation of the one God\r\nor gods, in whom according to his knowledge or superstition he may\r\nbelieve; but in this case the additional fear of divine punishment often\r\nsupervenes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The strictly Social Virtues at first alone regarded._--The above view\r\nof the first origin and nature of the moral sense, which tells us what\r\nwe ought to do, and of the conscience which reproves us if we disobey\r\nit, accords well with what we see of the early and undeveloped condition\r\nof this faculty in mankind. The virtues which must be practised, at\r\nleast generally, by rude men, so that they may associate in a body, are\r\nthose which are still recognised as the most important. But they are\r\npractised almost exclusively in relation to the men of the same tribe;\r\nand their opposites are not regarded as crimes in relation to the men of\r\nother tribes. No tribe could hold together if murder, robbery,\r\ntreachery, &c., were common; consequently such crimes within the limits\r\nof the same tribe \"are branded with everlasting infamy;\"[123] but excite\r\nno such sentiment beyond these limits. A North-American Indian is well\r\npleased with himself, and is honoured by others, when he scalps a man of\r\nanother tribe; and a Dyak cuts off the head of an unoffending person\r\nand dries it as a trophy. The murder of infants has prevailed on the\r\nlargest scale throughout the world,[124] and has met with no reproach;\r\nbut infanticide, especially of females, has been thought to be good for\r\nthe tribe, or at least not injurious. Suicide during former times was\r\nnot generally considered as a crime,[125] but rather from the courage\r\ndisplayed as an honourable act; and it is still largely practised by\r\nsome semi-civilised nations without reproach, for the loss to a nation\r\nof a single individual is not felt: whatever the explanation may be,\r\nsuicide, as I hear from Sir J. Lubbock, is rarely practised by the\r\nlowest barbarians. It has been recorded that an Indian Thug\r\nconscientiously regretted that he had not strangled and robbed as many\r\ntravellers as did his father before him. In a rude state of civilisation\r\nthe robbery of strangers is, indeed, generally considered as honourable.\r\n\r\nThe great sin of Slavery has been almost universal, and slaves have\r\noften been treated in an infamous manner. As barbarians do not regard\r\nthe opinion of their women, wives are commonly treated like slaves. Most\r\nsavages are utterly indifferent to the sufferings of strangers, or even\r\ndelight in witnessing them. It is well known that the women and children\r\nof the North-American Indians aided in torturing their enemies. Some\r\nsavages take a horrid pleasure in cruelty to animals,[126] and humanity\r\nwith them is an unknown virtue. Nevertheless, feelings of sympathy and\r\nkindness are common, especially during sickness, between the members of\r\nthe same tribe, and are sometimes extended beyond the limits of the\r\ntribe. Mungo Park's touching account of the kindness of the negro women\r\nof the interior to him is well known. Many instances could be given of\r\nthe noble fidelity of savages towards each other, but not to strangers;\r\ncommon experience justifies the maxim of the Spaniard, \"Never, never\r\ntrust an Indian.\" There cannot be fidelity without truth; and this\r\nfundamental virtue is not rare between the members of the same tribe:\r\nthus Mungo Park heard the negro women teaching their young children to\r\nlove the truth. This, again, is one of the virtues which becomes so\r\ndeeply rooted in the mind that it is sometimes practised by savages even\r\nat a high cost, towards strangers; but to lie to your enemy has rarely\r\nbeen thought a sin, as the history of modern diplomacy too plainly\r\nshews. As soon as a tribe has a recognised leader, disobedience becomes\r\na crime, and even abject submission is looked at as a sacred virtue.\r\n\r\nAs during rude times no man can be useful or faithful to his tribe\r\nwithout courage, this quality has universally been placed in the highest\r\nrank; and although, in civilised countries, a good, yet timid, man may\r\nbe far more useful to the community than a brave one, we cannot help\r\ninstinctively honouring the latter above a coward, however benevolent.\r\nPrudence, on the other hand, which does not concern the welfare of\r\nothers, though a very useful virtue, has never been highly esteemed. As\r\nno man can practise the virtues necessary for the welfare of his tribe\r\nwithout self-sacrifice, self-command, and the power of endurance, these\r\nqualities have been at all times highly and most justly valued. The\r\nAmerican savage voluntarily submits without a groan to the most horrid\r\ntortures to prove and strengthen his fortitude and courage; and we\r\ncannot help admiring him, or even an Indian Fakir, who, from a foolish\r\nreligious motive, swings suspended by a hook buried in his flesh.\r\n\r\nThe other self-regarding virtues, which do not obviously, though they\r\nmay really, affect the welfare of the tribe, have never been esteemed by\r\nsavages, though now highly appreciated by civilised nations. The\r\ngreatest intemperance with savages is no reproach. Their utter\r\nlicentiousness, not to mention unnatural crimes, is something\r\nastounding.[127] As soon, however, as marriage, whether polygamous or\r\nmonogamous, becomes common, jealousy will lead to the inculcation of\r\nfemale virtue; and this being honoured will tend to spread to the\r\nunmarried females. How slowly it spreads to the male sex we see at the\r\npresent day. Chastity eminently requires self-command; therefore it has\r\nbeen honoured from a very early period in the moral history of civilised\r\nman. As a consequence of this, the senseless practice of celibacy has\r\nbeen ranked from a remote period as a virtue.[128] The hatred of\r\nindecency, which appears to us so natural as to be thought innate, and\r\nwhich is so valuable an aid to chastity, is a modern virtue,\r\nappertaining exclusively, as Sir G. Staunton remarks,[129] to civilised\r\nlife. This is shewn by the ancient religious rites of various nations,\r\nby the drawings on the walls of Pompeii, and by the practices of many\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that actions are regarded by savages, and were probably\r\nso regarded by primeval man, as good or bad, solely as they affect in an\r\nobvious manner the welfare of the tribe,--not that of the species, nor\r\nthat of man as an individual member of the tribe. This conclusion\r\nagrees well with the belief that the so-called moral sense is\r\naboriginally derived from the social instincts, for both relate at first\r\nexclusively to the community. The chief causes of the low morality of\r\nsavages, as judged by our standard, are, firstly, the confinement of\r\nsympathy to the same tribe. Secondly, insufficient powers of reasoning,\r\nso that the bearing of many virtues, especially of the self-regarding\r\nvirtues, on the general welfare of the tribe is not recognised. Savages,\r\nfor instance, fail to trace the multiplied evils consequent on a want of\r\ntemperance, chastity, &c. And, thirdly, weak power of self-command; for\r\nthis power has not been strengthened through long-continued, perhaps\r\ninherited, habit, instruction and religion.\r\n\r\nI have entered into the above details on the immorality of savages,[130]\r\nbecause some authors have recently taken a high view of their moral\r\nnature, or have attributed most of their crimes to mistaken\r\nbenevolence.[131] These authors appear to rest their conclusion on\r\nsavages possessing, as they undoubtedly do possess, and often in a high\r\ndegree, those virtues which are serviceable, or even necessary, for the\r\nexistence of a tribal community.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._--Philosophers of the derivative[132] school of\r\nmorals formerly assumed that the foundation of morality lay in a form of\r\nSelfishness; but more recently in the \"Greatest Happiness principle.\"\r\nAccording to the view given above, the moral sense is fundamentally\r\nidentical with the social instincts; and in the case of the lower\r\nanimals it would be absurd to speak of these instincts as having been\r\ndeveloped from selfishness, or for the happiness of the community. They\r\nhave, however, certainly been developed for the general good of the\r\ncommunity. The term, general good, may be defined as the means by which\r\nthe greatest possible number of individuals can be reared in full vigour\r\nand health, with all their faculties perfect, under the conditions to\r\nwhich they are exposed. As the social instincts both of man and the\r\nlower animals have no doubt been developed by the same steps, it would\r\nbe advisable, if found practicable, to use the same definition in both\r\ncases, and to take as the test of morality, the general good or welfare\r\nof the community, rather than the general happiness; but this definition\r\nwould perhaps require some limitation on account of political ethics.\r\n\r\nWhen a man risks his life to save that of a fellow-creature, it seems\r\nmore appropriate to say that he acts for the general good or welfare,\r\nrather than for the general happiness of mankind. No doubt the welfare\r\nand the happiness of the individual usually coincide; and a contented,\r\nhappy tribe will flourish better than one that is discontented and\r\nunhappy. We have seen that at an early period in the history of man, the\r\nexpressed wishes of the community will have naturally influenced to a\r\nlarge extent the conduct of each member; and as all wish for happiness,\r\nthe \"greatest happiness principle\" will have become a most important\r\nsecondary guide and object; the social instincts, including sympathy,\r\nalways serving as the primary impulse and guide. Thus the reproach of\r\nlaying the foundation of the most noble part of our nature in the base\r\nprinciple of selfishness is removed; unless indeed the satisfaction\r\nwhich every animal feels when it follows its proper instincts, and the\r\ndissatisfaction felt when prevented, be called selfish.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the wishes and judgment of the members of the same\r\ncommunity, at first by oral and afterwards by written language, serves,\r\nas just remarked, as a most important secondary guide of conduct, in aid\r\nof the social instincts, but sometimes in opposition to them. This\r\nlatter fact is well exemplified by the _Law of Honour_, that is the law\r\nof the opinion of our equals, and not of all our countrymen. The breach\r\nof this law, even when the breach is known to be strictly accordant with\r\ntrue morality, has caused many a man more agony than a real crime. We\r\nrecognise the same influence in the burning sense of shame which most of\r\nus have felt even after the interval of years, when calling to mind some\r\naccidental breach of a trifling though fixed rule of etiquette. The\r\njudgment of the community will generally be guided by some rude\r\nexperience of what is best in the long run for all the members; but this\r\njudgment will not rarely err from ignorance and from weak powers of\r\nreasoning. Hence the strangest customs and superstitions, in complete\r\nopposition to the true welfare and happiness of mankind, have become\r\nall-powerful throughout the world. We see this in the horror felt by a\r\nHindoo who breaks his caste, in the shame of a Mahometan woman who\r\nexposes her face, and in innumerable other instances. It would be\r\ndifficult to distinguish between the remorse felt by a Hindoo who has\r\neaten unclean food, from that felt after committing a theft; but the\r\nformer would probably be the more severe.\r\n\r\nHow so many absurd rules of conduct, as well as so many absurd religious\r\nbeliefs, have originated we do not know; nor how it is that they have\r\nbecome, in all quarters of the world, so deeply impressed on the mind\r\nof men; but it is worthy of remark that a belief constantly inculcated\r\nduring the early years of life, whilst the brain is impressible, appears\r\nto acquire almost the nature of an instinct; and the very essence of an\r\ninstinct is that it is followed independently of reason. Neither can we\r\nsay why certain admirable virtues, such as the love of truth, are much\r\nmore highly appreciated by some savage tribes than by others;[133] nor,\r\nagain, why similar differences prevail even amongst civilised nations.\r\nKnowing how firmly fixed many strange customs and superstitions have\r\nbecome, we need feel no surprise that the self-regarding virtues should\r\nnow appear to us so natural, supported as they are by reason, as to be\r\nthought innate, although they were not valued by man in his early\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding many sources of doubt, man can generally and readily\r\ndistinguish between the higher and lower moral rules. The higher are\r\nfounded on the social instincts, and relate to the welfare of others.\r\nThey are supported by the approbation of our fellow-men and by reason.\r\nThe lower rules, though some of them when implying self-sacrifice hardly\r\ndeserve to be called lower, relate chiefly to self, and owe their origin\r\nto public opinion, when matured by experience and cultivated; for they\r\nare not practised by rude tribes.\r\n\r\nAs man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united into larger\r\ncommunities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he\r\nought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members\r\nof the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being\r\nonce reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his\r\nsympathies extending to the men of all nations and races. If, indeed,\r\nsuch men are separated from him by great differences in appearance or\r\nhabits, experience unfortunately shews us how long it is before we look\r\nat them as our fellow-creatures. Sympathy beyond the confines of man,\r\nthat is humanity to the lower animals, seems to be one of the latest\r\nmoral acquisitions. It is apparently unfelt by savages, except towards\r\ntheir pets. How little the old Romans knew of it is shewn by their\r\nabhorrent gladiatorial exhibitions. The very idea of humanity, as far as\r\nI could observe, was new to most of the Gauchos of the Pampas. This\r\nvirtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise\r\nincidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely\r\ndiffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. As soon as\r\nthis virtue is honoured and practised by some few men, it spreads\r\nthrough instruction and example to the young, and eventually through\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nThe highest stage in moral culture at which we can arrive, is when we\r\nrecognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and \"not even in inmost\r\nthought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to\r\nus.\"[134] Whatever makes any bad action familiar to the mind, renders\r\nits performance by so much the easier. As Marcus Aurelius long ago said,\r\n\"Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of\r\nthy mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts.\"[135]\r\n\r\nOur great philosopher, Herbert Spencer, has recently explained his views\r\non the moral sense. He says,[136] \"I believe that the experiences of\r\nutility organised and consolidated through all past generations of the\r\nhuman race, have been producing corresponding modifications, which, by\r\ncontinued transmission and accumulation, have become in us certain\r\nfaculties of moral intuition--certain emotions responding to right and\r\nwrong conduct, which have no apparent basis in the individual\r\nexperiences of utility.\" There is not the least inherent improbability,\r\nas it seems to me, in virtuous tendencies being more or less strongly\r\ninherited; for, not to mention the various dispositions and habits\r\ntransmitted by many of our domestic animals, I have heard of cases in\r\nwhich a desire to steal and a tendency to lie appeared to run in\r\nfamilies of the upper ranks; and as stealing is so rare a crime in the\r\nwealthy classes, we can hardly account by accidental coincidence for the\r\ntendency occurring in two or three members of the same family. If bad\r\ntendencies are transmitted, it is probable that good ones are likewise\r\ntransmitted. Excepting through the principle of the transmission of\r\nmoral tendencies, we cannot understand the differences believed to exist\r\nin this respect between the various races of mankind. We have, however,\r\nas yet, hardly sufficient evidence on this head.\r\n\r\nEven the partial transmission of virtuous tendencies would be an immense\r\nassistance to the primary impulse derived directly from the social\r\ninstincts, and indirectly from the approbation of our fellow-men.\r\nAdmitting for the moment that virtuous tendencies are inherited, it\r\nappears probable, at least in such cases as chastity, temperance,\r\nhumanity to animals, &c., that they become first impressed on the mental\r\norganisation through habit, instruction, and example, continued during\r\nseveral generations in the same family, and in a quite subordinate\r\ndegree, or not at all, by the individuals possessing such virtues,\r\nhaving succeeded best in the struggle for life. My chief source of doubt\r\nwith respect to any such inheritance, is that senseless customs,\r\nsuperstitions, and tastes, such as the horror of a Hindoo for unclean\r\nfood, ought on the same principle to be transmitted. Although this in\r\nitself is perhaps not less probable than that animals should acquire\r\ninherited tastes for certain kinds of food or fear of certain foes, I\r\nhave not met with any evidence in support of the transmission of\r\nsuperstitious customs or senseless habits.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the social instincts which no doubt were acquired by man, as by\r\nthe lower animals, for the good of the community, will from the first\r\nhave given to him some wish to aid his fellows, and some feeling of\r\nsympathy. Such impulses will have served him at a very early period as a\r\nrude rule of right and wrong. But as man gradually advanced in\r\nintellectual power and was enabled to trace the more remote consequences\r\nof his actions; as he acquired sufficient knowledge to reject baneful\r\ncustoms and superstitions; as he regarded more and more not only the\r\nwelfare but the happiness of his fellow-men; as from habit, following on\r\nbeneficial experience, instruction, and example, his sympathies became\r\nmore tender and widely diffused, so as to extend to the men of all\r\nraces, to the imbecile, the maimed, and other useless members of\r\nsociety, and finally to the lower animals,--so would the standard of his\r\nmorality rise higher and higher. And it is admitted by moralists of the\r\nderivative school and by some intuitionists, that the standard of\r\nmorality has risen since an early period in the history of man.[137]\r\n\r\nAs a struggle may sometimes be seen going on between the various\r\ninstincts of the lower animals, it is not surprising that there should\r\nbe a struggle in man between his social instincts, with their derived\r\nvirtues, and his lower, though at the moment, stronger impulses or\r\ndesires. This, as Mr. Galton[138] has remarked, is all the less\r\nsurprising, as man has emerged from a state of barbarism within a\r\ncomparatively recent period. After having yielded to some temptation we\r\nfeel a sense of dissatisfaction, analogous to that felt from other\r\nunsatisfied instincts, called in this case conscience; for we cannot\r\nprevent past images and impressions continually passing through our\r\nminds, and these in their weakened state we compare with the\r\never-present social instincts, or with habits gained in early youth and\r\nstrengthened during our whole lives, perhaps inherited, so that they are\r\nat last rendered almost as strong as instincts. Looking to future\r\ngenerations, there is no cause to fear that the social instincts will\r\ngrow weaker, and we may expect that virtuous habits will grow stronger,\r\nbecoming perhaps fixed by inheritance. In this case the struggle between\r\nour higher and lower impulses will be less severe, and virtue will be\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of the two last Chapters._--There can be no doubt that the\r\ndifference between the mind of the lowest man and that of the highest\r\nanimal is immense. An anthropomorphous ape, if he could take a\r\ndispassionate view of his own case, would admit that though he could\r\nform an artful plan to plunder a garden--though he could use stones for\r\nfighting or for breaking open nuts, yet that the thought of fashioning\r\na stone into a tool was quite beyond his scope. Still less, as he would\r\nadmit, could he follow out a train of metaphysical reasoning, or solve a\r\nmathematical problem, or reflect on God, or admire a grand natural\r\nscene. Some apes, however, would probably declare that they could and\r\ndid admire the beauty of the coloured skin and fur of their partners in\r\nmarriage. They would admit, that though they could make other apes\r\nunderstand by cries some of their perceptions and simpler wants, the\r\nnotion of expressing definite ideas by definite sounds had never crossed\r\ntheir minds. They might insist that they were ready to aid their\r\nfellow-apes of the same troop in many ways, to risk their lives for\r\nthem, and to take charge of their orphans; but they would be forced to\r\nacknowledge that disinterested love for all living creatures, the most\r\nnoble attribute of man, was quite beyond their comprehension.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the difference in mind between man and the higher animals,\r\ngreat as it is, is certainly one of degree and not of kind. We have seen\r\nthat the senses and intuitions, the various emotions and faculties, such\r\nas love, memory, attention, curiosity, imitation, reason, &c., of which\r\nman boasts, may be found in an incipient, or even sometimes in a\r\nwell-developed condition, in the lower animals. They are also capable of\r\nsome inherited improvement, as we see in the domestic dog compared with\r\nthe wolf or jackal. If it be maintained that certain powers, such as\r\nself-consciousness, abstraction, &c., are peculiar to man, it may well\r\nbe that these are the incidental results of other highly-advanced\r\nintellectual faculties; and these again are mainly the result of the\r\ncontinued use of a highly developed language. At what age does the\r\nnew-born infant possess the power of abstraction, or become\r\nself-conscious and reflect on its own existence? We cannot answer; nor\r\ncan we answer in regard to the ascending organic scale. The half-art and\r\nhalf-instinct of language still bears the stamp of its gradual\r\nevolution. The ennobling belief in God is not universal with man; and\r\nthe belief in active spiritual agencies naturally follows from his other\r\nmental powers. The moral sense perhaps affords the best and highest\r\ndistinction between man and the lower animals; but I need not say\r\nanything on this head, as I have so lately endeavoured to shew\r\nthat the social instincts,--the prime principle of man's moral\r\nconstitution[139]--with the aid of active intellectual powers and the\r\neffects of habit, naturally lead to the golden rule, \"As ye would that\r\nmen should do to you, do ye to them likewise;\" and this lies at the\r\nfoundation of morality.\r\n\r\nIn a future chapter I shall make some few remarks on the probable steps\r\nand means by which the several mental and moral faculties of man have\r\nbeen gradually evolved. That this at least is possible ought not to be\r\ndenied, when we daily see their development in every infant; and when we\r\nmay trace a perfect gradation from the mind of an utter idiot, lower\r\nthan that of the lowest animal, to the mind of a Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nON THE MANNER OF DEVELOPMENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Variability of body and mind in man--Inheritance--Causes of\r\n  variability--Laws of variation the same in man as in the lower\r\n  animals--Direct action of the conditions of life--Effects of\r\n  the increased use and disuse of parts--Arrested\r\n  development--Reversion--Correlated variation--Rate of\r\n  increase--Checks to increase--Natural selection--Man the most\r\n  dominant animal in the world--Importance of his corporeal\r\n  structure--The causes which have led to his becoming\r\n  erect--Consequent changes of structure--Decrease in size of the\r\n  canine teeth--Increased size and altered shape of the\r\n  skull--Nakedness--Absence of a tail--Defenceless condition of\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the first chapter that the homological structure of man,\r\nhis embryological development and the rudiments which he still retains,\r\nall declare in the plainest manner that he is descended from some lower\r\nform. The possession of exalted mental powers is no insuperable\r\nobjection to this conclusion. In order that an ape-like creature should\r\nhave been transformed into man, it is necessary that this early form, as\r\nwell as many successive links, should all have varied in mind and body.\r\nIt is impossible to obtain direct evidence on this head; but if it can\r\nbe shewn that man now varies--that his variations are induced by the\r\nsame general causes, and obey the same general laws, as in the case of\r\nthe lower animals--there can be little doubt that the preceding\r\nintermediate links varied in a like manner. The variations at each\r\nsuccessive stage of descent must, also, have been in some manner\r\naccumulated and fixed.\r\n\r\nThe facts and conclusions to be given in this chapter relate almost\r\nexclusively to the probable means by which the transformation of man has\r\nbeen effected, as far as his bodily structure is concerned. The\r\nfollowing chapter will be devoted to the development of his intellectual\r\nand moral faculties. But the present discussion likewise bears on the\r\norigin of the different races or species of mankind, whichever term may\r\nbe preferred.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that man is now subject to much variability. No two\r\nindividuals of the same race are quite alike. We may compare millions of\r\nfaces, and each will be distinct. There is an equally great amount of\r\ndiversity in the proportions and dimensions of the various parts of the\r\nbody; the length of the legs being one of the most variable points.[140]\r\nAlthough in some quarters of the world an elongated skull, and in other\r\nquarters a short skull prevails, yet there is great diversity of shape\r\neven within the limits of the same race, as with the aborigines of\r\nAmerica and South Australia,--the latter a race \"probably as pure and\r\nhomogeneous in blood, customs, and language as any in existence\"--and\r\neven with the inhabitants of so confined an area as the Sandwich\r\nIslands.[141] An eminent dentist assures me that there is nearly as much\r\ndiversity in the teeth, as in the features. The chief arteries so\r\nfrequently run in abnormal courses, that it has been found useful for\r\nsurgical purposes to calculate from 12,000 corpses how often each\r\ncourse prevails.[142] The muscles are eminently variable: thus those of\r\nthe foot were found by Prof. Turner[143] not to be strictly alike in any\r\ntwo out of fifty bodies; and in some the deviations were considerable.\r\nProf. Turner adds that the power of performing the appropriate movements\r\nmust have been modified in accordance with the several deviations. Mr.\r\nJ. Wood has recorded[144] the occurrence of 295 muscular variations in\r\nthirty-six subjects, and in another set of the same number no less than\r\n558 variations, reckoning both sides of the body as one. In the last\r\nset, not one body out of the thirty-six was \"found totally wanting in\r\ndepartures from the standard descriptions of the muscular system given\r\nin anatomical text-books.\" A single body presented the extraordinary\r\nnumber of twenty-five distinct abnormalities. The same muscle sometimes\r\nvaries in many ways: thus Prof. Macalister describes[145] no less than\r\ntwenty distinct variations in the _palmaris accessorius_.\r\n\r\nThe famous old anatomist, Wolff,[146] insists that the internal viscera\r\nare more variable than the external parts: _Nulla particula est quae non\r\naliter et aliter in aliis se habeat hominibus._ He has even written a\r\ntreatise on the choice of typical examples of the viscera for\r\nrepresentation. A discussion on the beau-ideal of the liver, lungs,\r\nkidneys, &c., as of the human face divine, sounds strange in our ears.\r\n\r\nThe variability or diversity of the mental faculties in men of the same\r\nrace, not to mention the greater differences between the men of\r\ndistinct races, is so notorious that not a word need here be said. So it\r\nis with the lower animals, as has been illustrated by a few examples in\r\nthe last chapter. All who have had charge of menageries admit this fact,\r\nand we see it plainly in our dogs and other domestic animals. Brehm\r\nespecially insists that each individual monkey of those which he kept\r\nunder confinement in Africa had its own peculiar disposition and temper:\r\nhe mentions one baboon remarkable for its high intelligence; and the\r\nkeepers in the Zoological Gardens pointed out to me a monkey, belonging\r\nto the New World division, equally remarkable for intelligence. Rengger,\r\nalso, insists on the diversity in the various mental characters of the\r\nmonkeys of the same species which he kept in Paraguay; and this\r\ndiversity, as he adds, is partly innate, and partly the result of the\r\nmanner in which they have been treated or educated.[147]\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere[148] so fully discussed the subject of Inheritance that\r\nI need here add hardly anything. A greater number of facts have been\r\ncollected with respect to the transmission of the most trifling, as well\r\nas of the most important characters in man than in any of the lower\r\nanimals; though the facts are copious enough with respect to the latter.\r\nSo in regard to mental qualities, their transmission is manifest in our\r\ndogs, horses, and other domestic animals. Besides special tastes and\r\nhabits, general intelligence, courage, bad and good temper, &c., are\r\ncertainly transmitted. With man we see similar facts in almost every\r\nfamily; and we now know through the admirable labours of Mr. Galton[149]\r\nthat genius, which implies a wonderfully complex combination of high\r\nfaculties, tends to be inherited; and, on the other hand, it is too\r\ncertain that insanity and deteriorated mental powers likewise run in the\r\nsame families.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the causes of variability we are in all cases very\r\nignorant; but we can see that in man as in the lower animals, they stand\r\nin some relation with the conditions to which each species has been\r\nexposed during several generations. Domesticated animals vary more than\r\nthose in a state of nature; and this is apparently due to the\r\ndiversified and changing nature of their conditions. The different races\r\nof man resemble in this respect domesticated animals, and so do the\r\nindividuals of the same race when inhabiting a very wide area, like that\r\nof America. We see the influence of diversified conditions in the more\r\ncivilised nations, the members of which belong to different grades of\r\nrank and follow different occupations, presenting a greater range of\r\ncharacter than the members of barbarous nations. But the uniformity of\r\nsavages has often been exaggerated, and in some cases can hardly be said\r\nto exist.[150] It is nevertheless an error to speak of man, even if we\r\nlook only to the conditions to which he has been subjected, as \"far more\r\ndomesticated\"[151] than any other animal. Some savage races, such as\r\nthe Australians, are not exposed to more diversified conditions than are\r\nmany species which have very wide ranges. In another and much more\r\nimportant respect, man differs widely from any strictly domesticated\r\nanimal; for his breeding has not been controlled, either through\r\nmethodical or unconscious selection. No race or body of men has been so\r\ncompletely subjugated by other men, that certain individuals have been\r\npreserved and thus unconsciously selected, from being in some way more\r\nuseful to their masters. Nor have certain male and female individuals\r\nbeen intentionally picked out and matched, except in the well-known case\r\nof the Prussian grenadiers; and in this case man obeyed, as might have\r\nbeen expected, the law of methodical selection; for it is asserted that\r\nmany tall men were reared in the villages inhabited by the grenadiers\r\nwith their tall wives.\r\n\r\nIf we consider all the races of man, as forming a single species, his\r\nrange is enormous; but some separate races, as the Americans and\r\nPolynesians, have very wide ranges. It is a well-known law that\r\nwidely-ranging species are much more variable than species with\r\nrestricted ranges; and the variability of man may with more truth be\r\ncompared with that of widely-ranging species, than with that of\r\ndomesticated animals.\r\n\r\nNot only does variability appear to be induced in man and the lower\r\nanimals by the same general causes, but in both the same characters are\r\naffected in a closely analogous manner. This has been proved in such\r\nfull detail by Godron and Quatrefages, that I need here only refer to\r\ntheir works.[152] Monstrosities, which graduate into slight variations,\r\nare likewise so similar in man and the lower animals, that the same\r\nclassification and the same terms can be used for both, as may be seen\r\nin Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire's great work.[153] This is a necessary\r\nconsequence of the same laws of change prevailing throughout the animal\r\nkingdom. In my work on the variation of domestic animals, I have\r\nattempted to arrange in a rude fashion the laws of variation under the\r\nfollowing heads:--The direct and definite action of changed conditions,\r\nas shewn by all or nearly all the individuals of the same species\r\nvarying in the same manner under the same circumstances. The effects of\r\nthe long-continued use or disuse of parts. The cohesion of homologous\r\nparts. The variability of multiple parts. Compensation of growth; but of\r\nthis law I have found no good instances in the case of man. The effects\r\nof the mechanical pressure of one part on another; as of the pelvis on\r\nthe cranium of the infant in the womb. Arrests of development, leading\r\nto the diminution or suppression of parts. The reappearance of long-lost\r\ncharacters through reversion. And lastly, correlated variation. All\r\nthese so-called laws apply equally to man and the lower animals; and\r\nmost of them even to plants. It would be superfluous here to discuss all\r\nof them;[154] but several are so important for us, that they must be\r\ntreated at considerable length.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The direct and definite action of changed conditions._--This is a most\r\nperplexing subject. It cannot be denied that changed conditions produce\r\nsome effect, and occasionally a considerable effect, on organisms of all\r\nkinds; and it seems at first probable that if sufficient time were\r\nallowed this would be the invariable result. But I have failed to obtain\r\nclear evidence in favour of this conclusion; and valid reasons may be\r\nurged on the other side, at least as far as the innumerable structures\r\nare concerned, which are adapted for special ends. There can, however,\r\nbe no doubt that changed conditions induce an almost indefinite amount\r\nof fluctuating variability, by which the whole organisation is rendered\r\nin some degree plastic.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, above 1,000,000 soldiers, who served in the late\r\nwar, were measured, and the States in which they were born and reared\r\nrecorded.[155] From this astonishing number of observations it is proved\r\nthat local influences of some kind act directly on stature; and we\r\nfurther learn that \"the State where the physical growth has in great\r\nmeasure taken place, and the State of birth, which indicates the\r\nancestry, seem to exert a marked influence on the stature.\" For instance\r\nit is established, \"that residence in the Western States, during the\r\nyears of growth, tends to produce increase of stature.\" On the other\r\nhand, it is certain that with sailors, their manner of life delays\r\ngrowth, as shewn \"by the great difference between the statures of\r\nsoldiers and sailors at the ages of 17 and 18 years.\" Mr. B. A. Gould\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the nature of the influences which thus act on\r\nstature; but he arrived only at negative results, namely, that they did\r\nnot relate to climate, the elevation of the land, soil, nor even \"in any\r\ncontrolling degree\" to the abundance or need of the comforts of life.\r\nThis latter conclusion is directly opposed to that arrived at by\r\nVillerme from the statistics of the height of the conscripts in\r\ndifferent parts of France. When we compare the differences in stature\r\nbetween the Polynesian chiefs and the lower orders within the same\r\nislands, or between the inhabitants of the fertile volcanic and low\r\nbarren coral islands of the same ocean,[156] or again between the\r\nFuegians on the eastern and western shores of their country, where the\r\nmeans of subsistence are very different, it is scarcely possible to\r\navoid the conclusion that better food and greater comfort do influence\r\nstature. But the preceding statements shew how difficult it is to arrive\r\nat any precise result. Dr. Beddoe has lately proved that, with the\r\ninhabitants of Britain, residence in towns and certain occupations have\r\na deteriorating influence on height; and he infers that the result is to\r\na certain extent inherited, as is likewise the case in the United\r\nStates. Dr. Beddoe further believes that wherever a \"race attains its\r\nmaximum of physical development, it rises highest in energy and moral\r\nvigour.\"[157]\r\n\r\nWhether external conditions produce any other direct effect on man is\r\nnot known. It might have been expected that differences of climate would\r\nhave had a marked influence, as the lungs and kidneys are brought into\r\nfuller activity under a low temperature, and the liver and skin under a\r\nhigh one.[158] It was formerly thought that the colour of the skin and\r\nthe character of the hair were determined by light or heat; and\r\nalthough it can hardly be denied that some effect is thus produced,\r\nalmost all observers now agree that the effect has been very small, even\r\nafter exposure during many ages. But this subject will be more properly\r\ndiscussed when we treat of the different races of mankind. With our\r\ndomestic animals there are grounds for believing that cold and damp\r\ndirectly affect the growth of the hair; but I have not met with any\r\nevidence on this head in the case of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts._--It is well known\r\nthat use strengthens the muscles in the individual, and complete disuse,\r\nor the destruction of the proper nerve, weakens them. When the eye is\r\ndestroyed the optic nerve often becomes atrophied. When an artery is\r\ntied, the lateral channels increase not only in diameter, but in the\r\nthickness and strength of their coats. When one kidney ceases acting\r\nfrom disease, the other increases in size and does double work. Bones\r\nincrease not only in thickness, but in length, from carrying a greater\r\nweight.[159] Different occupations habitually followed lead to changed\r\nproportions in various parts of the body. Thus it was clearly\r\nascertained by the United States Commission[160] that the legs of the\r\nsailors employed in the late war were longer by 0.217 of an inch than\r\nthose of the soldiers, though the sailors were on an average shorter\r\nmen; whilst their arms were shorter by 1.09 of an inch, and therefore\r\nout of proportion shorter in relation to their lesser height. This\r\nshortness of the arms is apparently due to their greater use, and is an\r\nunexpected result; but sailors chiefly use their arms in pulling and not\r\nin supporting weights. The girth of the neck and the depth of the instep\r\nare greater, whilst the circumference of the chest, waist, and hips is\r\nless in sailors than in soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhether the several foregoing modifications would become hereditary, if\r\nthe same habits of life were followed during many generations, is not\r\nknown, but is probable. Rengger[161] attributes the thin legs and thick\r\narms of the Payaguas Indians to successive generations having passed\r\nnearly their whole lives in canoes, with their lower extremities\r\nmotionless. Other writers have come to a similar conclusion in other\r\nanalogous cases. According to Cranz,[162] who lived for a long time with\r\nthe Esquimaux, \"the natives believe that ingenuity and dexterity in\r\nseal-catching (their highest art and virtue) is hereditary; there is\r\nreally something in it, for the son of a celebrated seal-catcher will\r\ndistinguish himself though he lost his father in childhood.\" But in this\r\ncase it is mental aptitude, quite as much as bodily structure, which\r\nappears to be inherited. It is asserted that the hands of English\r\nlabourers are at birth larger than those of the gentry.[163] From the\r\ncorrelation which exists, at least in some cases,[164] between the\r\ndevelopment of the extremities and of the jaws, it is possible that in\r\nthose classes which do not labour much with their hands and feet, the\r\njaws would be reduced in size from this cause. That they are generally\r\nsmaller in refined and civilised men than in hard-working men or\r\nsavages, is certain. But with savages, as Mr. Herbert Spencer[165] has\r\nremarked, the greater use of the jaws in chewing coarse, uncooked food,\r\nwould act in a direct manner on the masticatory muscles and on the bones\r\nto which they are attached. In infants long before birth, the skin on\r\nthe soles of the feet is thicker than on any other part of the\r\nbody;[166] and it can hardly be doubted that this is due to the\r\ninherited effects of pressure during a long series of generations.\r\n\r\nIt is familiar to every one that watchmakers and engravers are liable to\r\nbecome short-sighted, whilst sailors and especially savages are\r\ngenerally long-sighted. Short-sight and long-sight certainly tend to be\r\ninherited.[167] The inferiority of Europeans, in comparison with\r\nsavages, in eyesight and in the other senses, is no doubt the\r\naccumulated and transmitted effect of lessened use during many\r\ngenerations; for Rengger[168] states that he has repeatedly observed\r\nEuropeans, who had been brought up and spent their whole lives with the\r\nwild Indians, who nevertheless did not equal them in the sharpness of\r\ntheir senses. The same naturalist observes that the cavities in the\r\nskull for the reception of the several sense-organs are larger in the\r\nAmerican aborigines than in Europeans; and this no doubt indicates a\r\ncorresponding difference in the dimensions of the organs themselves.\r\nBlumenbach has also remarked on the large size of the nasal cavities in\r\nthe skulls of the American aborigines, and connects this fact with their\r\nremarkably acute power of smell. The Mongolians of the plains of\r\nNorthern Asia, according to Pallas, have wonderfully perfect senses; and\r\nPrichard believes that the great breadth of their skulls across the\r\nzygomas follows from their highly-developed sense-organs.[169]\r\n\r\nThe Quechua Indians inhabit the lofty plateaux of Peru, and Alcide\r\nd'Orbigny states[170] that from continually breathing a highly rarefied\r\natmosphere they have acquired chests and lungs of extraordinary\r\ndimensions. The cells, also, of the lungs are larger and more numerous\r\nthan in Europeans. These observations have been doubted; but Mr. D.\r\nForbes carefully measured many Aymaras, an allied race, living at the\r\nheight of between ten and fifteen thousand feet; and he informs me[171]\r\nthat they differ conspicuously from the men of all other races seen by\r\nhim, in the circumference and length of their bodies. In his table of\r\nmeasurements, the stature of each man is taken at 1000, and the other\r\nmeasurements are reduced to this standard. It is here seen that the\r\nextended arms of the Aymaras are shorter than those of Europeans, and\r\nmuch shorter than those of Negroes. The legs are likewise shorter, and\r\nthey present this remarkable peculiarity, that in every Aymara measured\r\nthe femur is actually shorter than the tibia. On an average the length\r\nof the femur to that of the tibia is as 211 to 252; whilst in two\r\nEuropeans measured at the same time, the femora to the tibiae were as\r\n244 to 230; and in three Negroes as 258 to 241. The humerus is likewise\r\nshorter relatively to the fore-arm. This shortening of that part of the\r\nlimb which is nearest to the body, appears to be, as suggested to me by\r\nMr. Forbes, a case of compensation in relation with the greatly\r\nincreased length of the trunk. The Aymaras present some other singular\r\npoints of structure, for instance, the very small projection of the\r\nheel.\r\n\r\nThese men are so thoroughly acclimatised to their cold and lofty abode,\r\nthat when formerly carried down by the Spaniards to the low Eastern\r\nplains, and when now tempted down by high wages to the gold-washings,\r\nthey suffer a frightful rate of mortality. Nevertheless Mr. Forbes found\r\na few pure families which had survived during two generations; and he\r\nobserved that they still inherited their characteristic peculiarities.\r\nBut it was manifest, even without measurement, that these peculiarities\r\nhad all decreased; and on measurement their bodies were found not to be\r\nso much elongated as those of the men on the high plateau; whilst their\r\nfemora had become somewhat lengthened, as had their tibiae but in a less\r\ndegree. The actual measurements may be seen by consulting Mr. Forbes'\r\nmemoir. From these valuable observations, there can, I think, be no\r\ndoubt that residence during many generations at a great elevation tends,\r\nboth directly and indirectly, to induce inherited modifications in the\r\nproportions of the body.[172]\r\n\r\nAlthough man may not have been much modified during the latter stages of\r\nhis existence through the increased or decreased use of parts, the\r\nfacts now given shew that his liability in this respect has not been\r\nlost; and we positively know that the same law holds good with the lower\r\nanimals. Consequently we may infer, that when at a remote epoch the\r\nprogenitors of man were in a transitional state, and were changing from\r\nquadrupeds into bipeds, natural selection would probably have been\r\ngreatly aided by the inherited effects of the increased or diminished\r\nuse of the different parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrests of Development._--Arrested development differs from arrested\r\ngrowth, as parts in the former state continue to grow whilst still\r\nretaining their early condition. Various monstrosities come under this\r\nhead, and some are known to be occasionally inherited, as a\r\ncleft-palate. It will suffice for our purpose to refer to the arrested\r\nbrain-development of microcephalous idiots, as described in Vogt's great\r\nmemoir.[173] Their skulls are smaller, and the convolutions of the brain\r\nare less complex than in normal men. The frontal sinus, or the\r\nprojection over the eyebrows, is largely developed, and the jaws are\r\nprognathous to an \"_effrayant_\" degree; so that these idiots somewhat\r\nresemble the lower types of mankind. Their intelligence and most of\r\ntheir mental faculties are extremely feeble. They cannot acquire the\r\npower of speech, and are wholly incapable of prolonged attention, but\r\nare much given to imitation. They are strong and remarkably active,\r\ncontinually gamboling and jumping about, and making grimaces. They often\r\nascend stairs on all-fours; and are curiously fond of climbing up\r\nfurniture or trees. We are thus reminded of the delight shewn by almost\r\nall boys in climbing trees; and this again reminds us how lambs and\r\nkids, originally alpine animals, delight to frisk on any hillock,\r\nhowever small.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reversion._--Many of the cases to be here given might have been\r\nintroduced under the last heading. Whenever a structure is arrested in\r\nits development, but still continues growing until it closely resembles\r\na corresponding structure in some lower and adult member of the same\r\ngroup, we may in one sense consider it as a case of reversion. The lower\r\nmembers in a group give us some idea how the common progenitor of the\r\ngroup was probably constructed; and it is hardly credible that a part\r\narrested at an early phase of embryonic development should be enabled to\r\ncontinue growing so as ultimately to perform its proper function, unless\r\nit had acquired this power of continued growth during some earlier state\r\nof existence, when the present exceptional or arrested structure was\r\nnormal. The simple brain of a microcephalous idiot, in as far as it\r\nresembles that of an ape, may in this sense be said to offer a case of\r\nreversion. There are other cases which come more strictly under our\r\npresent heading of reversion. Certain structures, regularly occurring in\r\nthe lower members of the group to which man belongs, occasionally make\r\ntheir appearance in him, though not found in the normal human embryo;\r\nor, if present in the normal human embryo, they become developed in an\r\nabnormal manner, though this manner of development is proper to the\r\nlower members of the same group. These remarks will be rendered clearer\r\nby the following illustrations.\r\n\r\nIn various mammals the uterus graduates from a double organ with two\r\ndistinct orifices and two passages, as in the marsupials, into a single\r\norgan, showing no signs of doubleness except a slight internal fold, as\r\nin the higher apes and man. The rodents exhibit a perfect series of\r\ngradations between these two extreme states. In all mammals the uterus\r\nis developed from two simple primitive tubes, the inferior portions of\r\nwhich form the cornua; and it is in the words of Dr. Farre \"by the\r\ncoalescence of the two cornua at their lower extremities that the body\r\nof the uterus is formed in man; while in those animals in which no\r\nmiddle portion or body exists, the cornua remain ununited. As the\r\ndevelopment of the uterus proceeds, the two cornua become gradually\r\nshorter, until at length they are lost, or, as it were, absorbed into\r\nthe body of the uterus.\" The angles of the uterus are still produced\r\ninto cornua, even so high in the scale as in the lower apes, and their\r\nallies the lemurs.\r\n\r\nNow in women anomalous cases are not very infrequent, in which the\r\nmature uterus is furnished with cornua, or is partially divided into two\r\norgans; and such cases, according to Owen, repeat \"the grade of\r\nconcentrative development,\" attained by certain rodents. Here perhaps we\r\nhave an instance of a simple arrest of embryonic development, with\r\nsubsequent growth and perfect functional development, for either side of\r\nthe partially double uterus is capable of performing the proper office\r\nof gestation. In other and rarer cases, two distinct uterine cavities\r\nare formed, each having its proper orifice and passage.[174] No such\r\nstage is passed through during the ordinary development of the embryo,\r\nand it is difficult to believe, though perhaps not impossible, that the\r\ntwo simple, minute, primitive tubes could know how (if such an\r\nexpression may be used) to grow into two distinct uteri, each with a\r\nwell-constructed orifice and passage, and each furnished with numerous\r\nmuscles, nerves, glands and vessels, if they had not formerly passed\r\nthrough a similar course of development, as in the case of existing\r\nmarsupials. No one will pretend that so perfect a structure as the\r\nabnormal double uterus in woman could be the result of mere chance. But\r\nthe principle of reversion, by which long-lost dormant structures are\r\ncalled back into existence, might serve as the guide for the full\r\ndevelopment of the organ, even after the lapse of an enormous interval\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nProfessor Canestrini,[175] after discussing the foregoing and various\r\nanalogous cases, arrives at the same conclusion as that just given. He\r\nadduces, as another instance, the malar bone, which, in some of the\r\nQuadrumana and other mammals, normally consists of two portions. This is\r\nits condition in the two-months-old human foetus; and thus it\r\nsometimes remains, through arrested development, in man when adult, more\r\nespecially in the lower prognathous races. Hence Canestrini concludes\r\nthat some ancient progenitor of man must have possessed this bone\r\nnormally divided into two portions, which subsequently became fused\r\ntogether. In man the frontal bone consists of a single piece, but in the\r\nembryo and in children, and in almost all the lower mammals, it consists\r\nof two pieces separated by a distinct suture. This suture occasionally\r\npersists, more or less distinctly, in man after maturity, and more\r\nfrequently in ancient than in recent crania, especially as Canestrini\r\nhas observed in those exhumed from the Drift and belonging to the\r\nbrachycephalic type. Here again he comes to the same conclusion as in\r\nthe analogous case of the malar bones. In this and other instances\r\npresently to be given, the cause of ancient races approaching the lower\r\nanimals in certain characters more frequently than do the modern races,\r\nappears to be that the latter stand at a somewhat greater distance in\r\nthe long line of descent from their early semi-human progenitors.\r\n\r\nVarious other anomalies in man, more or less analogous with the\r\nforegoing, have been advanced by different authors[176] as cases of\r\nreversion; but these seem not a little doubtful, for we have to descend\r\nextremely low in the mammalian series before we find such structures\r\nnormally present.[177]\r\n\r\nIn man the canine teeth are perfectly efficient instruments for\r\nmastication. But their true canine character, as Owen[178] remarks, \"is\r\nindicated by the conical form of the crown, which terminates in an\r\nobtuse point, is convex outward and flat or sub-concave within, at the\r\nbase of which surface there is a feeble prominence. The conical form is\r\nbest expressed in the Melanian races, especially the Australian. The\r\ncanine is more deeply implanted, and by a stronger fang than the\r\nincisors.\" Nevertheless this tooth no longer serves man as a special\r\nweapon for tearing his enemies or prey; it may, therefore, as far as its\r\nproper function is concerned, be considered as rudimentary. In every\r\nlarge collection of human skulls some may be found, as Haeckel[179]\r\nobserves, with the canine teeth projecting considerably beyond the\r\nothers in the same manner, but in a less degree, as in the\r\nanthropomorphous apes. In these cases, open spaces between the teeth in\r\nthe one jaw are left for the reception of the canines belonging to the\r\nopposite jaw. An interspace of this kind in a Kaffir skull, figured by\r\nWagner, is surprisingly wide.[180] Considering how few ancient skulls\r\nhave been examined in comparison with recent skulls, it is an\r\ninteresting fact that in at least three cases the canines project\r\nlargely; and in the Naulette jaw they are spoken of as enormous.[181]\r\n\r\nThe males alone of the anthropomorphous apes have their canines fully\r\ndeveloped; but in the female gorilla, and in a less degree in the female\r\norang, these teeth project considerably beyond the others; therefore the\r\nfact that women sometimes have, as I have been assured, considerably\r\nprojecting canines, is no serious objection to the belief that their\r\noccasional great development in man is a case of reversion to an\r\nape-like progenitor. He who rejects with scorn the belief that the shape\r\nof his own canines, and their occasional great development in other men,\r\nare due to our early progenitors having been provided with these\r\nformidable weapons, will probably reveal by sneering the line of his\r\ndescent. For though he no longer intends, nor has the power, to use\r\nthese teeth as weapons, he will unconsciously retract his \"snarling\r\nmuscles\" (thus named by Sir C. Bell)[182] so as to expose them ready for\r\naction, like a dog prepared to fight.\r\n\r\nMany muscles are occasionally developed in man, which are proper to the\r\nQuadrumana or other mammals. Professor Vlacovich[183] examined forty\r\nmale subjects, and found a muscle, called by him the ischiopubic, in\r\nnineteen of them; in three others there was a ligament which represented\r\nthis muscle; and in the remaining eighteen no trace of it. Out of thirty\r\nfemale subjects this muscle was developed on both sides in only two, but\r\nin three others the rudimentary ligament was present. This muscle,\r\ntherefore, appears to be much more common in the male than in the female\r\nsex; and on the principle of the descent of man from some lower form,\r\nits presence can be understood; for it has been detected in several of\r\nthe lower animals, and in all of these it serves exclusively to aid the\r\nmale in the act of reproduction.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Wood, in his valuable series of papers,[184] has minutely\r\ndescribed a vast number of muscular variations in man, which resemble\r\nnormal structures in the lower animals. Looking only to the muscles\r\nwhich closely resemble those regularly present in our nearest allies,\r\nthe Quadrumana, they are too numerous to be here even specified. In a\r\nsingle male subject, having a strong bodily frame and well-formed skull,\r\nno less than seven muscular variations were observed, all of which\r\nplainly represented muscles proper to various kinds of apes. This man,\r\nfor instance, had on both sides of his neck a true and powerful\r\n\"_levator claviculae_,\" such as is found in all kinds of apes, and which\r\nis said to occur in about one out of sixty human subjects.[185] Again,\r\nthis man had \"a special abductor of the metatarsal bone of the fifth\r\ndigit, such as Professor Huxley and Mr. Flower have shewn to exist\r\nuniformly in the higher and lower apes.\" The hands and arms of man are\r\neminently characteristic structures, but their muscles are extremely\r\nliable to vary, so as to resemble the corresponding muscles in the lower\r\nanimals.[186] Such resemblances are either complete and perfect or\r\nimperfect, yet in this latter case manifestly of a transitional nature.\r\nCertain variations are more common in man, and others in woman, without\r\nour being able to assign any reason. Mr. Wood, after describing numerous\r\ncases, makes the following pregnant remark: \"Notable departures from the\r\nordinary type of the muscular structures run in grooves or directions,\r\nwhich must be taken to indicate some unknown factor, of much importance\r\nto a comprehensive knowledge of general and scientific anatomy.\"[187]\r\n\r\nThat this unknown factor is reversion to a former state of existence may\r\nbe admitted as in the highest degree probable. It is quite incredible\r\nthat a man should through mere accident abnormally resemble, in no less\r\nthan seven of his muscles, certain apes, if there had been no genetic\r\nconnection between them. On the other hand, if man is descended from\r\nsome ape-like creature, no valid reason can be assigned why certain\r\nmuscles should not suddenly reappear after an interval of many thousand\r\ngenerations, in the same manner as with horses, asses, and mules,\r\ndark-coloured stripes suddenly reappear on the legs and shoulders, after\r\nan interval of hundreds, or more probably thousands, of generations.\r\n\r\nThese various cases of reversion are so closely related to those of\r\nrudimentary organs given in the first chapter, that many of them might\r\nhave been indifferently introduced in either chapter. Thus a human\r\nuterus furnished with cornua may be said to represent in a rudimentary\r\ncondition the same organ in its normal state in certain mammals. Some\r\nparts which are rudimental in man, as the os coccyx in both sexes and\r\nthe mammae in the male sex, are always present; whilst others, such as\r\nthe supra-condyloid foramen, only occasionally appear, and therefore\r\nmight have been introduced under the head of reversion. These several\r\nreversionary, as well as the strictly rudimentary, structures reveal the\r\ndescent of man from some lower form in an unmistakeable manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Correlated Variation._--In man, as in the lower animals, many\r\nstructures are so intimately related, that when one part varies so does\r\nanother, without our being able, in most cases, to assign any reason. We\r\ncannot say whether the one part governs the other, or whether both are\r\ngoverned by some earlier developed part. Various monstrosities, as I.\r\nGeoffroy repeatedly insists, are thus intimately connected. Homologous\r\nstructures are particularly liable to change together, as we see on the\r\nopposite sides of the body, and in the upper and lower extremities.\r\nMeckel long ago remarked that when the muscles of the arm depart from\r\ntheir proper type, they almost always imitate those of the leg; and so\r\nconversely with the muscles of the legs. The organs of sight and\r\nhearing, the teeth and hair, the colour of the skin and hair, colour and\r\nconstitution, are more or less correlated.[188] Professor Schaaffhausen\r\nfirst drew attention to the relation apparently existing between a\r\nmuscular frame and strongly-pronounced supra-orbital ridges, which are\r\nso characteristic of the lower races of man.\r\n\r\nBesides the variations which can be grouped with more or less\r\nprobability under the foregoing heads, there is a large class of\r\nvariations which may be provisionally called spontaneous, for they\r\nappear, owing to our ignorance, to arise without any exciting cause. It\r\ncan, however, be shewn that such variations, whether consisting of\r\nslight individual differences, or of strongly-marked and abrupt\r\ndeviations of structure, depend much more on the constitution of the\r\norganism than on the nature of the conditions to which it has been\r\nsubjected.[189]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rate of Increase._--Civilised populations have been known under\r\nfavourable conditions, as in the United States, to double their number\r\nin twenty-five years; and according to a calculation by Euler, this\r\nmight occur in a little over twelve years.[190] At the former rate the\r\npresent population of the United States, namely, thirty millions, would\r\nin 657 years cover the whole terraqueous globe so thickly, that four men\r\nwould have to stand on each square yard of surface. The primary or\r\nfundamental check to the continued increase of man is the difficulty of\r\ngaining subsistence and of living in comfort. We may infer that this is\r\nthe case from what we see, for instance, in the United States, where\r\nsubsistence is easy and there is plenty of room. If such means were\r\nsuddenly doubled in Great Britain, our number would be quickly doubled.\r\nWith civilised nations the above primary check acts chiefly by\r\nrestraining marriages. The greater death-rate of infants in the poorest\r\nclasses is also very important; as well as the greater mortality at all\r\nages, and from various diseases, of the inhabitants of crowded and\r\nmiserable houses. The effects of severe epidemics and wars are soon\r\ncounterbalanced, and more than counterbalanced, in nations placed under\r\nfavourable conditions. Emigration also comes in aid as a temporary\r\ncheck, but not to any great extent with the extremely poor classes.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect, as Malthus has remarked, that the\r\nreproductive power is actually less in barbarous than in civilised\r\nraces. We know nothing positively on this head, for with savages no\r\ncensus has been taken; but from the concurrent testimony of\r\nmissionaries, and of others who have long resided with such people, it\r\nappears that their families are usually small, and large ones rare. This\r\nmay be partly accounted for, as it is believed, by the women suckling\r\ntheir infants for a prolonged period; but it is highly probable that\r\nsavages, who often suffer much hardship, and who do not obtain so much\r\nnutritious food as civilised men, would be actually less prolific. I\r\nhave shewn in a former work,[191] that all our domesticated quadrupeds\r\nand birds, and all our cultivated plants, are more fertile than the\r\ncorresponding species in a state of nature. It is no valid objection to\r\nthis conclusion that animals suddenly supplied with an excess of food,\r\nor when rendered very fat, and that most plants when suddenly removed\r\nfrom very poor to very rich soil, are rendered more or less sterile. We\r\nmight, therefore, expect that civilised men, who in one sense are highly\r\ndomesticated, would be more prolific than wild men. It is also probable\r\nthat the increased fertility of civilised nations would become, as with\r\nour domestic animals, an inherited character: it is at least known that\r\nwith mankind a tendency to produce twins runs in families.[192]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that savages appear to be less prolific than civilised\r\npeople, they would no doubt rapidly increase if their numbers were not\r\nby some means rigidly kept down. The Santali, or hill-tribes of India,\r\nhave recently afforded a good illustration of this fact; for they have\r\nincreased, as shewn by Mr. Hunter,[193] at an extraordinary rate since\r\nvaccination has been introduced, other pestilences mitigated, and war\r\nsternly repressed. This increase, however, would not have been possible\r\nhad not these rude people spread into the adjoining districts and worked\r\nfor hire. Savages almost always marry; yet there is some prudential\r\nrestraint, for they do not commonly marry at the earliest possible age.\r\nThe young men are often required to show that they can support a wife,\r\nand they generally have first to earn the price with which to purchase\r\nher from her parents. With savages the difficulty of obtaining\r\nsubsistence occasionally limits their number in a much more direct\r\nmanner than with civilised people, for all tribes periodically suffer\r\nfrom severe famines. At such times savages are forced to devour much bad\r\nfood, and their health can hardly fail to be injured. Many accounts have\r\nbeen published of their protruding stomachs and emaciated limbs after\r\nand during famines. They are then, also, compelled to wander much about,\r\nand their infants, as I was assured in Australia, perish in large\r\nnumbers. As famines are periodical, depending chiefly on extreme\r\nseasons, all tribes must fluctuate in number. They cannot steadily and\r\nregularly increase, as there is no artificial increase in the supply of\r\nfood. Savages when hardly pressed encroach on each other's territories,\r\nand war is the result; but they are indeed almost always at war with\r\ntheir neighbours. They are liable to many accidents on land and water in\r\ntheir search for food; and in some countries they must suffer much from\r\nthe larger beasts of prey. Even in India, districts have been\r\ndepopulated by the ravages of tigers.\r\n\r\nMalthus has discussed these several checks, but he does not lay stress\r\nenough on what is probably the most important of all, namely\r\ninfanticide, especially of female infants, and the habit of procuring\r\nabortion. These practices now prevail in many quarters of the world, and\r\ninfanticide seems formerly to have prevailed, as Mr. M'Lennan[194] has\r\nshewn, on a still more extensive scale. These practices appear to have\r\noriginated in savages recognising the difficulty, or rather the\r\nimpossibility of supporting all the infants that are born.\r\nLicentiousness may also be added to the foregoing checks; but this does\r\nnot follow from failing means of subsistence; though there is reason to\r\nbelieve that in some cases (as in Japan) it has been intentionally\r\nencouraged as a means of keeping down the population.\r\n\r\nIf we look back to an extremely remote epoch, before man had arrived at\r\nthe dignity of manhood, he would have been guided more by instinct and\r\nless by reason than are savages at the present time. Our early\r\nsemi-human progenitors would not have practised infanticide, for the\r\ninstincts of the lower animals are never so perverted as to lead them\r\nregularly to destroy their own offspring. There would have been no\r\nprudential restraint from marriage, and the sexes would have freely\r\nunited at an early age. Hence the progenitors of man would have tended\r\nto increase rapidly, but checks of some kind, either periodical or\r\nconstant, must have kept down their numbers, even more severely than\r\nwith existing savages. What the precise nature of these checks may have\r\nbeen, we cannot say, any more than with most other animals. We know that\r\nhorses and cattle, which are not highly prolific animals, when first\r\nturned loose in South America, increased at an enormous rate. The\r\nslowest breeder of all known animals, namely the elephant, would in a\r\nfew thousand years stock the whole world. The increase of every species\r\nof monkey must be checked by some means; but not, as Brehm remarks, by\r\nthe attacks of beasts of prey. No one will assume that the actual power\r\nof reproduction in the wild horses and cattle of America, was at first\r\nin any sensible degree increased; or that, as each district became fully\r\nstocked, this same power was diminished. No doubt in this case and in\r\nall others, many checks concur, and different checks under different\r\ncircumstances; periodical dearths, depending on unfavourable seasons,\r\nbeing probably the most important of all. So it will have been with the\r\nearly progenitors of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Selection._--We have now seen that man is variable in body and\r\nmind; and that the variations are induced, either directly or\r\nindirectly, by the same general causes, and obey the same general laws,\r\nas with the lower animals. Man has spread widely over the face of the\r\nearth, and must have been exposed, during his incessant migrations,[195]\r\nto the most diversified conditions. The inhabitants of Tierra del\r\nFuego, the Cape of Good Hope, and Tasmania in the one hemisphere, and of\r\nthe Arctic regions in the other, must have passed through many climates\r\nand changed their habits many times, before they reached their present\r\nhomes.[196] The early progenitors of man must also have tended, like all\r\nother animals, to have increased beyond their means of subsistence; they\r\nmust therefore occasionally have been exposed to a struggle for\r\nexistence, and consequently to the rigid law of natural selection.\r\nBeneficial variations of all kinds will thus, either occasionally or\r\nhabitually, have been preserved, and injurious ones eliminated. I do not\r\nrefer to strongly-marked deviations of structure, which occur only at\r\nlong intervals of time, but to mere individual differences. We know, for\r\ninstance, that the muscles of our hands and feet, which determine our\r\npowers of movement, are liable, like those of the lower animals,[197] to\r\nincessant variability. If then the ape-like progenitors of man which\r\ninhabited any district, especially one undergoing some change in its\r\nconditions, were divided into two equal bodies, the one half which\r\nincluded all the individuals best adapted by their powers of movement\r\nfor gaining subsistence or for defending themselves, would on an average\r\nsurvive in greater number and procreate more offspring than the other\r\nand less well endowed half.\r\n\r\nMan in the rudest state in which he now exists is the most dominant\r\nanimal that has ever appeared on the earth. He has spread more widely\r\nthan any other highly organised form; and all others have yielded\r\nbefore him. He manifestly owes this immense superiority to his\r\nintellectual faculties, his social habits, which lead him to aid and\r\ndefend his fellows, and to his corporeal structure. The supreme\r\nimportance of these characters has been proved by the final arbitrament\r\nof the battle for life. Through his powers of intellect, articulate\r\nlanguage has been evolved; and on this his wonderful advancement has\r\nmainly depended. He has invented and is able to use various weapons,\r\ntools, traps, &c., with which he defends himself, kills or catches prey,\r\nand otherwise obtains food. He has made rafts or canoes on which to fish\r\nor cross over to neighbouring fertile islands. He has discovered the art\r\nof making fire, by which hard and stringy roots can be rendered\r\ndigestible, and poisonous roots or herbs innocuous. This last discovery,\r\nprobably the greatest, excepting language, ever made by man, dates from\r\nbefore the dawn of history. These several inventions, by which man in\r\nthe rudest state has become so preeminent, are the direct result of the\r\ndevelopment of his powers of observation, memory, curiosity,\r\nimagination, and reason. I cannot, therefore, understand how it is that\r\nMr. Wallace[198] maintains, that \"natural selection could only have\r\nendowed the savage with a brain a little superior to that of an ape.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the intellectual powers and social habits of man are of\r\nparamount importance to him, we must not underrate the importance of his\r\nbodily structure, to which subject the remainder of this chapter will be\r\ndevoted. The development of the intellectual and social or moral\r\nfaculties will be discussed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nEven to hammer with precision is no easy matter, as every one who has\r\ntried to learn carpentry will admit. To throw a stone with as true an\r\naim as can a Fuegian in defending himself, or in killing birds, requires\r\nthe most consummate perfection in the correlated action of the muscles\r\nof the hand, arm, and shoulder, not to mention a fine sense of touch. In\r\nthrowing a stone or spear, and in many other actions, a man must stand\r\nfirmly on his feet; and this again demands the perfect coadaptation of\r\nnumerous muscles. To chip a flint into the rudest tool, or to form a\r\nbarbed spear or hook from a bone, demands the use of a perfect hand;\r\nfor, as a most capable judge, Mr. Schoolcraft,[199] remarks, the shaping\r\nfragments of stone into knives, lances, or arrow-heads, shews\r\n\"extraordinary ability and long practice.\" We have evidence of this in\r\nprimeval men having practised a division of labour; each man did not\r\nmanufacture his own flint tools or rude pottery; but certain individuals\r\nappear to have devoted themselves to such work, no doubt receiving in\r\nexchange the produce of the chase. Archaeologists are convinced that an\r\nenormous interval of time elapsed before our ancestors thought of\r\ngrinding chipped flints into smooth tools. A man-like animal who\r\npossessed a hand and arm sufficiently perfect to throw a stone with\r\nprecision or to form a flint into a rude tool, could, it can hardly be\r\ndoubted, with sufficient practice make almost anything, as far as\r\nmechanical skill alone is concerned, which a civilised man can make. The\r\nstructure of the hand in this respect may be compared with that of the\r\nvocal organs, which in the apes are used for uttering various\r\nsignal-cries, or, as in one species, musical cadences; but in man\r\nclosely similar vocal organs have become adapted through the inherited\r\neffects of use for the utterance of articulate language.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the nearest allies of man, and therefore to the best\r\nrepresentatives of our early progenitors, we find that the hands in the\r\nQuadrumana are constructed on the same general pattern as in us, but are\r\nfar less perfectly adapted for diversified uses. Their hands do not\r\nserve so well as the feet of a dog for locomotion; as may be seen in\r\nthose monkeys which walk on the outer margins of the palms, or on the\r\nbacks of their bent fingers, as in the chimpanzee and orang.[200] Their\r\nhands, however, are admirably adapted for climbing trees. Monkeys seize\r\nthin branches or ropes, with the thumb on one side and the fingers and\r\npalm on the other side, in the same manner as we do. They can thus also\r\ncarry rather large objects, such as the neck of a bottle, to their\r\nmouths. Baboons turn over stones and scratch up roots with their hands.\r\nThey seize nuts, insects, or other small objects with the thumb in\r\nopposition to the fingers, and no doubt they thus extract eggs and the\r\nyoung from the nests of birds. American monkeys beat the wild oranges on\r\nthe branches until the rind is cracked, and then tear it off with the\r\nfingers of the two hands. Other monkeys open mussel-shells with the two\r\nthumbs. With their fingers they pull out thorns and burrs, and hunt for\r\neach other's parasites. In a state of nature they break open hard fruits\r\nwith the aid of stones. They roll down stones or throw them at their\r\nenemies; nevertheless, they perform these various actions clumsily, and\r\nthey are quite unable, as I have myself seen, to throw a stone with\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me far from true that because \"objects are grasped clumsily\"\r\nby monkeys, \"a much less specialised organ of prehension\" would have\r\nserved them[201] as well as their present hands. On the contrary, I see\r\nno reason to doubt that a more perfectly constructed hand would have\r\nbeen an advantage to them, provided, and it is important to note this,\r\nthat their hands had not thus been rendered less well adapted for\r\nclimbing trees. We may suspect that a perfect hand would have been\r\ndisadvantageous for climbing; as the most arboreal monkeys in the world,\r\nnamely Ateles in America and Hylobates in Asia, either have their thumbs\r\nmuch reduced in size and even rudimentary, or their fingers\r\npartially coherent, so that their hands are converted into mere\r\ngrasping-hooks.[202]\r\n\r\nAs soon as some ancient member in the great series of the Primates came,\r\nowing to a change in its manner of procuring subsistence, or to a change\r\nin the conditions of its native country, to live somewhat less on trees\r\nand more on the ground, its manner of progression would have been\r\nmodified; and in this case it would have had to become either more\r\nstrictly quadrupedal or bipedal. Baboons frequent hilly and rocky\r\ndistricts, and only from necessity climb up high trees;[203] and they\r\nhave acquired almost the gait of a dog. Man alone has become a biped;\r\nand we can, I think, partly see how he has come to assume his erect\r\nattitude, which forms one of the most conspicuous differences between\r\nhim and his nearest allies. Man could not have attained his present\r\ndominant position in the world without the use of his hands which are so\r\nadmirably adapted to act in obedience to his will. As Sir C. Bell[204]\r\ninsists \"the hand supplies all instruments, and by its correspondence\r\nwith the intellect gives him universal dominion.\" But the hands and arms\r\ncould hardly have become perfect enough to have manufactured weapons, or\r\nto have hurled stones and spears with a true aim, as long as they were\r\nhabitually used for locomotion and for supporting the whole weight of\r\nthe body, or as long as they were especially well adapted, as previously\r\nremarked, for climbing trees. Such rough treatment would also have\r\nblunted the sense of touch, on which their delicate use largely depends.\r\nFrom these causes alone it would have been an advantage to man to have\r\nbecome a biped; but for many actions it is almost necessary that both\r\narms and the whole upper part of the body should be free; and he must\r\nfor this end stand firmly on his feet. To gain this great advantage, the\r\nfeet have been rendered flat, and the great toe peculiarly modified,\r\nthough this has entailed the loss of the power of prehension. It accords\r\nwith the principle of the division of physiological labour, which\r\nprevails throughout the animal kingdom, that as the hands became\r\nperfected for prehension, the feet should have become perfected for\r\nsupport and locomotion. With some savages, however, the foot has not\r\naltogether lost its prehensile power, as shewn by their manner of\r\nclimbing trees and of using them in other ways.[205]\r\n\r\nIf it be an advantage to man to have his hands and arms free and to\r\nstand firmly on his feet, of which there can be no doubt from his\r\npreeminent success in the battle of life, then I can see no reason why\r\nit should not have been advantageous to the progenitors of man to have\r\nbecome more and more erect or bipedal. They would thus have been better\r\nable to have defended themselves with stones or clubs, or to have\r\nattacked their prey, or otherwise obtained food. The best constructed\r\nindividuals would in the long run have succeeded best, and have survived\r\nin larger numbers. If the gorilla and a few allied forms had become\r\nextinct, it might have been argued with great force and apparent truth,\r\nthat an animal could not have been gradually converted from a quadruped\r\ninto a biped; as all the individuals in an intermediate condition would\r\nhave been miserably ill-fitted for progression. But we know (and this is\r\nwell worthy of reflection) that several kinds of apes are now actually\r\nin this intermediate condition; and no one doubts that they are on the\r\nwhole well adapted for their conditions of life. Thus the gorilla runs\r\nwith a sidelong shambling gait, but more commonly progresses by resting\r\non its bent hands. The long-armed apes occasionally use their arms like\r\ncrutches, swinging their bodies forward between them, and some kinds of\r\nHylobates, without having been taught, can walk or run upright with\r\ntolerable quickness; yet they move awkwardly, and much less securely\r\nthan man. We see, in short, with existing monkeys various gradations\r\nbetween a form of progression strictly like that of a quadruped and that\r\nof a biped or man.\r\n\r\nAs the progenitors of man became more and more erect, with their hands\r\nand arms more and more modified for prehension and other purposes, with\r\ntheir feet and legs at the same time modified for firm support and\r\nprogression, endless other changes of structure would have been\r\nnecessary. The pelvis would have had to be made broader, the spine\r\npeculiarly curved and the head fixed in an altered position, and all\r\nthese changes have been attained by man. Prof. Schaaffhausen[206]\r\nmaintains that \"the powerful mastoid processes of the human skull are\r\nthe result of his erect position;\" and these processes are absent in the\r\norang, chimpanzee, &c., and are smaller in the gorilla than in man.\r\nVarious other structures might here have been specified, which appear\r\nconnected with man's erect position. It is very difficult to decide how\r\nfar all these correlated modifications are the result of natural\r\nselection, and how far of the inherited effects of the increased use of\r\ncertain parts, or of the action of one part on another. No doubt these\r\nmeans of change act and react on each other: thus when certain muscles,\r\nand the crests of bone to which they are attached, become enlarged by\r\nhabitual use, this shews that certain fictions are habitually performed\r\nand must be serviceable. Hence the individuals which performed them\r\nbest, would tend to survive in greater numbers.\r\n\r\nThe free use of the arms and hands, partly the cause and partly the\r\nresult of man's erect position, appears to have led in an indirect\r\nmanner to other modifications of structure. The early male progenitors\r\nof man were, as previously stated, probably furnished with great canine\r\nteeth; but as they gradually acquired the habit of using stones, clubs,\r\nor other weapons, for fighting with their enemies, they would have used\r\ntheir jaws and teeth less and less. In this case, the jaws, together\r\nwith the teeth, would have become reduced in size, as we may feel sure\r\nfrom innumerable analogous cases. In a future chapter we shall meet with\r\na closely-parallel case, in the reduction or complete disappearance of\r\nthe canine teeth in male ruminants, apparently in relation with the\r\ndevelopment of their horns; and in horses, in relation with their habit\r\nof fighting with their incisor teeth and hoofs.\r\n\r\nIn the adult male anthropomorphous apes, as Ruetimeyer,[207] and others\r\nhave insisted, it is precisely the effect which the jaw-muscles by their\r\ngreat development have produced on the skull, that causes it to differ\r\nso greatly in many respects from that of man, and has given to it \"a\r\ntruly frightful physiognomy.\" Therefore as the jaws and teeth in the\r\nprogenitors of man gradually become reduced in size, the adult skull\r\nwould have presented nearly the same characters which it offers in the\r\nyoung of the anthropomorphous apes, and would thus have come to resemble\r\nmore nearly that of existing man. A great reduction of the canine teeth\r\nin the males would almost certainly, as we shall hereafter see, have\r\naffected through inheritance the teeth of the females.\r\n\r\nAs the various mental faculties were gradually developed, the brain\r\nwould almost certainly have become larger. No one, I presume, doubts\r\nthat the large size of the brain in man, relatively to his body, in\r\ncomparison with that of the gorilla or orang, is closely connected with\r\nhis higher mental powers. We meet with closely analogous facts with\r\ninsects, in which the cerebral ganglia are of extraordinary dimensions\r\nin ants; these ganglia in all the Hymenoptera being many times larger\r\nthan in the less intelligent orders, such as beetles.[208] On the other\r\nhand, no one supposes that the intellect of any two animals or of any\r\ntwo men can be accurately gauged by the cubic contents of their skulls.\r\nIt is certain that there may be extraordinary mental activity with an\r\nextremely small absolute mass of nervous matter: thus the wonderfully\r\ndiversified instincts, mental powers, and affections of ants are\r\ngenerally known, yet their cerebral ganglia are not so large as the\r\nquarter of a small pin's head. Under this latter point of view, the\r\nbrain of an ant is one of the most marvellous atoms of matter in the\r\nworld, perhaps more marvellous than the brain of man.\r\n\r\nThe belief that there exists in man some close relation between the size\r\nof the brain and the development of the intellectual faculties is\r\nsupported by the comparison of the skulls of savage and civilised races,\r\nof ancient and modern people, and by the analogy of the whole\r\nvertebrate series. Dr. J. Barnard Davis has proved[209] by many careful\r\nmeasurements, that the mean internal capacity of the skull in Europeans\r\nis 92.3 cubic inches; in Americans 87.5; in Asiatics 87.1; and in\r\nAustralians only 81.9 inches. Professor Broca[210] found that skulls\r\nfrom graves in Paris of the nineteenth century, were larger than those\r\nfrom vaults of the twelfth century, in the proportion of 1484 to 1426;\r\nand Prichard is persuaded that the present inhabitants of Britain have\r\n\"much more capacious brain-cases\" than the ancient inhabitants.\r\nNevertheless it must be admitted that some skulls of very high\r\nantiquity, such as the famous one of Neanderthal, are well developed and\r\ncapacious. With respect to the lower animals, M. E. Lartet,[211] by\r\ncomparing the crania of tertiary and recent mammals, belonging to the\r\nsame groups, has come to the remarkable conclusion that the brain is\r\ngenerally larger and the convolutions more complex in the more recent\r\nform. On the other hand I have shewn[212] that the brains of domestic\r\nrabbits are considerably reduced in bulk, in comparison with those of\r\nthe wild rabbit or hare; and this may be attributed to their having been\r\nclosely confined during many generations, so that they have exerted but\r\nlittle their intellect, instincts, senses, and voluntary movements.\r\n\r\nThe gradually increasing weight of the brain and skull in man must have\r\ninfluenced the development of the supporting spinal column, more\r\nespecially whilst he was becoming erect. As this change of position was\r\nbeing brought about, the internal pressure of the brain, will, also,\r\nhave influenced the form of the skull; for many facts shew how easily\r\nthe skull is thus affected. Ethnologists believe that it is modified by\r\nthe kind of cradle in which infants sleep. Habitual spasms of the\r\nmuscles and a cicatrix from a severe burn have permanently modified the\r\nfacial bones. In young persons whose heads from disease have become\r\nfixed either sideways or backwards, one of the eyes has changed its\r\nposition, and the bones of the skull have been modified; and this\r\napparently results from the brain pressing in a new direction.[213] I\r\nhave shewn that with long-eared rabbits, even so trifling a cause as the\r\nlopping forward of one ear drags forward on that side almost every bone\r\nof the skull; so that the bones on the opposite sides no longer strictly\r\ncorrespond. Lastly, if any animal were to increase or diminish much in\r\ngeneral size, without any change in its mental powers; or if the mental\r\npowers were to be much increased or diminished without any great change\r\nin the size of the body; the shape of the skull would almost certainly\r\nbe altered. I infer this from my observations on domestic rabbits, some\r\nkinds of which have become very much larger than the wild animal, whilst\r\nothers have retained nearly the same size, but in both cases the brain\r\nhas been much reduced relatively to the size of the body. Now I was at\r\nfirst much surprised by finding that in all these rabbits the skull had\r\nbecome elongated or dolichocephalic; for instance, of two skulls of\r\nnearly equal breadth, the one from a wild rabbit and the other from a\r\nlarge domestic kind, the former was only 3.15 and the latter 4.3 inches\r\nin length.[214] One of the most marked distinctions in different races\r\nof man is that the skull in some is elongated, and in others rounded;\r\nand here the explanation suggested by the case of the rabbits may\r\npartially hold good; for Welcker finds that short \"men incline more to\r\nbrachycephaly, and tall men to dolichocephaly;\"[215] and tall men may be\r\ncompared with the larger and longer-bodied rabbits, all of which have\r\nelongated skulls, or are dolichocephalic.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts we can to a certain extent understand the means\r\nthrough which the great size and more or less rounded form of the skull\r\nhas been acquired by man; and these are characters eminently distinctive\r\nof him in comparison with the lower animals.\r\n\r\nAnother most conspicuous difference between man and the lower animals is\r\nthe nakedness of his skin. Whales and dolphins (Cetacea), dugongs\r\n(Sirenia) and the hippopotamus are naked; and this may be advantageous\r\nto them for gliding through the water; nor would it be injurious to them\r\nfrom the loss of warmth, as the species which inhabit the colder regions\r\nare protected by a thick layer of blubber, serving the same purpose as\r\nthe fur of seals and otters. Elephants and rhinoceroses are almost\r\nhairless; and as certain extinct species which formerly lived under an\r\narctic climate were covered with long wool or hair, it would almost\r\nappear as if the existing species of both genera had lost their hairy\r\ncovering from exposure to heat. This appears the more probable, as the\r\nelephants in India which live on elevated and cool districts are more\r\nhairy[216] than those on the lowlands. May we then infer that man became\r\ndivested of hair from having aboriginally inhabited some tropical land?\r\nThe fact of the hair being chiefly retained in the male sex on the chest\r\nand face, and in both sexes at the junction of all four limbs with the\r\ntrunk, favours this inference, assuming that the hair was lost before\r\nman became erect; for the parts which now retain most hair would then\r\nhave been most protected from the heat of the sun. The crown of the\r\nhead, however, offers a curious exception, for at all times it must have\r\nbeen one of the most exposed parts, yet it is thickly clothed with hair.\r\nIn this respect man agrees with the great majority of quadrupeds, which\r\ngenerally have their upper and exposed surfaces more thickly clothed\r\nthan the lower surface. Nevertheless, the fact that the other members of\r\nthe order of Primates, to which man belongs, although inhabiting various\r\nhot regions, are well clothed with hair, generally thickest on the upper\r\nsurface,[217] is strongly opposed to the supposition that man became\r\nnaked through the action of the sun. I am inclined to believe, as we\r\nshall see under sexual selection, that man, or rather primarily woman,\r\nbecame divested of hair for ornamental purposes; and according to this\r\nbelief it is not surprising that man should differ so greatly in\r\nhairiness from all his lower brethren, for characters gained through\r\nsexual selection often differ in closely-related forms to an\r\nextraordinary degree.\r\n\r\nAccording to a popular impression, the absence of a tail is eminently\r\ndistinctive of man; but as those apes which come nearest to man are\r\ndestitute of this organ, its disappearance does not especially concern\r\nus. Nevertheless it may be well to own that no explanation, as far as I\r\nam aware, has ever been given of the loss of the tail by certain apes\r\nand man. Its loss, however, is not surprising, for it sometimes differs\r\nremarkably in length in species of the same genera: thus in some species\r\nof Macacus the tail is longer than the whole body, consisting of\r\ntwenty-four vertebrae; in others it consists of a scarcely visible stump,\r\ncontaining only three or four vertebrae. In some kinds of baboons there\r\nare twenty-five, whilst in the mandrill there are ten very small stunted\r\ncaudal vertebrae, or, according to Cuvier,[218] sometimes only five. This\r\ngreat diversity in the structure and length of the tail in animals\r\nbelonging to the same genera, and following nearly the same habits of\r\nlife, renders it probable that the tail is not of much importance to\r\nthem; and if so, we might have expected that it would sometimes have\r\nbecome more or less rudimentary, in accordance with what we incessantly\r\nsee with other structures. The tail almost always tapers towards the end\r\nwhether it be long or short; and this, I presume, results from the\r\natrophy, through disuse, of the terminal muscles together with their\r\narteries and nerves, leading to the atrophy of the terminal bones. With\r\nrespect to the os coccyx, which in man and the higher apes manifestly\r\nconsists of the few basal and tapering segments of an ordinary tail, I\r\nhave heard it asked how could these have become completely embedded\r\nwithin the body; but there is no difficulty in this respect, for in many\r\nmonkeys the basal segments of the true tail are thus embedded. For\r\ninstance, Mr. Murie informs me that in the skeleton of a not full-grown\r\n_Macacus inornatus_, he counted nine or ten caudal vertebrae, which\r\naltogether were only 1.8 inch in length. Of these the three basal ones\r\nappeared to have been embedded; the remainder forming the free part of\r\nthe tail, which was only one inch in length, and half an inch in\r\ndiameter. Here, then, the three embedded caudal vertebrae plainly\r\ncorrespond with the four coalesced vertebrae of the human os coccyx.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now endeavoured to shew that some of the most distinctive\r\ncharacters of man have in all probability been acquired, either\r\ndirectly, or more commonly indirectly, through natural selection. We\r\nshould bear in mind that modifications in structure or constitution,\r\nwhich are of no service to an organism in adapting it to its habits of\r\nlife, to the food which it consumes, or passively to the surrounding\r\nconditions, cannot have been thus acquired. We must not, however, be too\r\nconfident in deciding what modifications are of service to each being:\r\nwe should remember how little we know about the use of many parts, or\r\nwhat changes in the blood or tissues may serve to fit an organism for a\r\nnew climate or some new kind of food. Nor must we forget the principle\r\nof correlation, by which, as Isidore Geoffroy has shewn in the case of\r\nman, many fit-range deviations of structure are tied together.\r\nIndependently of correlation, a change in one part often leads through\r\nthe increased or decreased use of other parts, to other changes of a\r\nquite unexpected nature. It is also well to reflect on such facts, as\r\nthe wonderful growth of galls on plants caused by the poison of an\r\ninsect, and on the remarkable changes of colour in the plumage of\r\nparrots when fed on certain fishes, or inoculated with the poison of\r\ntoads;[219] for we can thus see that the fluids of the system, if\r\naltered for some special purpose, might induce other strange changes. We\r\nshould especially bear in mind that modifications acquired and\r\ncontinually used during past ages for some useful purpose would probably\r\nbecome firmly fixed and might be long inherited.\r\n\r\nThus a very large yet undefined extension may safely be given to the\r\ndirect and indirect results of natural selection; but I now admit, after\r\nreading the essay by Naegeli on plants, and the remarks by various\r\nauthors with respect to animals, more especially those recently made by\r\nProfessor Broca, that in the earlier editions of my 'Origin of Species'\r\nI probably attributed too much to the action of natural selection or the\r\nsurvival of the fittest. I have altered the fifth edition of the Origin\r\nso as to confine my remarks to adaptive changes of structure. I had not\r\nformerly sufficiently considered the existence of many structures which\r\nappear to be, as far as we can judge, neither beneficial nor injurious;\r\nand this I believe to be one of the greatest oversights as yet detected\r\nin my work. I may be permitted to say as some excuse, that I had two\r\ndistinct objects in view, firstly, to shew that species had not been\r\nseparately created, and secondly, that natural selection had been the\r\nchief agent of change, though largely aided by the inherited effects of\r\nhabit, and slightly by the direct action of the surrounding conditions.\r\nNevertheless I was not able to annul the influence of my former belief,\r\nthen widely prevalent, that each species had been purposely created; and\r\nthis led to my tacitly assuming that every detail of structure,\r\nexcepting rudiments, was of some special, though unrecognised, service.\r\nAny one with this assumption in his mind would naturally extend the\r\naction of natural selection, either during past or present times, too\r\nfar. Some of those who admit the principle of evolution, but reject\r\nnatural selection, seem to forget, when criticising my book, that I had\r\nthe above two objects in view; hence if I have erred in giving to\r\nnatural selection great power, which I am far from admitting, or in\r\nhaving exaggerated its power, which is in itself probable, I have at\r\nleast, as I hope, done good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of\r\nseparate creations.\r\n\r\nThat all organic beings, including man, present many modifications of\r\nstructure which are of no service to them at present, nor have been\r\nformerly, is, as I can now see, probable. We know not what produces the\r\nnumberless slight differences between the individuals of each species,\r\nfor reversion only carries the problem a few steps backwards; but each\r\npeculiarity must have had its own efficient cause. If these causes,\r\nwhatever they may be, were to act more uniformly and energetically\r\nduring a lengthened period (and no reason can be assigned why this\r\nshould not sometimes occur), the result would probably be not mere\r\nslight individual differences, but well-marked, constant modifications.\r\nModifications which are in no way beneficial cannot have been kept\r\nuniform through natural selection, though any which were injurious would\r\nhave been thus eliminated. Uniformity of character would, however,\r\nnaturally follow from, the assumed uniformity of the exciting causes,\r\nand likewise from the free intercrossing of many individuals. The same\r\norganism might acquire in this manner during successive periods\r\nsuccessive modifications, and these would be transmitted in a nearly\r\nuniform state as long as the exciting causes remained the same and there\r\nwas free intercrossing. With respect to the exciting causes we can only\r\nsay, as when speaking of so-called spontaneous variations, that they\r\nrelate much more closely to the constitution of the varying organism,\r\nthan to the nature of the conditions to which it has been subjected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--In this chapter we have seen that as man at the present\r\nday is liable, like every other animal, to multiform individual\r\ndifferences or slight variations, so no doubt were the early progenitors\r\nof man; the variations being then as now induced by the same general\r\ncauses, and governed by the same general and complex laws. As all\r\nanimals tend to multiply beyond their means of subsistence, so it must\r\nhave been with the progenitors of man; and this will inevitably have led\r\nto a struggle for existence and to natural selection. This latter\r\nprocess will have been greatly aided by the inherited effects of the\r\nincreased use of parts; these two processes incessantly reacting on each\r\nother. It appears, also, as we shall hereafter see, that various\r\nunimportant characters have been acquired by man through sexual\r\nselection. An unexplained residuum of change, perhaps a large one, must\r\nbe left to the assumed uniform action of those unknown agencies, which\r\noccasionally induce strongly-marked and abrupt deviations of structure\r\nin our domestic productions.\r\n\r\nJudging from the habits of savages and of the greater number of the\r\nQuadrumana, primeval men, and even the ape-like progenitors of man,\r\nprobably lived in society. With strictly social animals, natural\r\nselection sometimes acts indirectly on the individual, through the\r\npreservation of variations which are beneficial only to the community. A\r\ncommunity including a large number of well-endowed individuals increases\r\nin number and is victorious over other and less well-endowed\r\ncommunities; although each separate member may gain no advantage over\r\nthe other members of the same community. With associated insects many\r\nremarkable structures, which are of little or no service to the\r\nindividual or its own offspring, such as the pollen-collecting\r\napparatus, or the sting of the worker-bee, or the great jaws of\r\nsoldier-ants, have been thus acquired. With the higher social animals, I\r\nam not aware that any structure has been modified solely for the good of\r\nthe community, though some are of secondary service to it. For instance,\r\nthe horns of ruminants and the great canine teeth of baboons appear to\r\nhave been acquired by the males as weapons for sexual strife, but they\r\nare used in defence of the herd or troop. In regard to certain mental\r\nfaculties the case, as we shall see in the following chapter, is wholly\r\ndifferent; for these faculties have been chiefly, or even exclusively,\r\ngained for the benefit of the community; the individuals composing the\r\ncommunity being at the same time indirectly benefited.\r\n\r\nIt has often been objected to such views as the foregoing, that man is\r\none of the most helpless and defenceless creatures in the world; and\r\nthat during his early and less well-developed condition he would have\r\nbeen still more helpless. The Duke of Argyll, for instance, insists[220]\r\nthat \"the human frame has diverged from the structure of brutes, in the\r\ndirection of greater physical helplessness and weakness. That is to say,\r\nit is a divergence which of all others it is most impossible to ascribe\r\nto mere natural selection.\" He adduces the naked and unprotected state\r\nof the body, the absence of great teeth or claws for defence, the little\r\nstrength of man, his small speed in running, and his slight power of\r\nsmell, by which to discover food or to avoid danger. To these\r\ndeficiencies there might have been added the still more serious loss of\r\nthe power of quickly climbing trees, so as to escape from enemies.\r\nSeeing that the unclothed Fuegians can exist under their wretched\r\nclimate, the loss of hair would not have been a great injury to primeval\r\nman, if he inhabited a warm country. When we compare defenceless man\r\nwith the apes, many of which are provided with formidable canine teeth,\r\nwe must remember that these in their fully-developed condition are\r\npossessed by the males alone, being chiefly used by them for fighting\r\nwith their rivals; yet the females which are not thus provided, are able\r\nto survive.\r\n\r\nIn regard to bodily size or strength, we do not know whether man is\r\ndescended from some comparatively small species, like the chimpanzee, or\r\nfrom one as powerful as the gorilla; and, therefore, we cannot say\r\nwhether man has become larger and stronger, or smaller and weaker, in\r\ncomparison with his progenitors. We should, however, bear in mind that\r\nan animal possessing great size, strength, and ferocity, and which, like\r\nthe gorilla, could defend itself from all enemies, would probably,\r\nthough not necessarily, have failed to become social; and this would\r\nmost effectually have checked the acquirement by man of his higher\r\nmental qualities, such as sympathy and the love of his fellow-creatures.\r\nHence it might have been an immense advantage to man to have sprung\r\nfrom some comparatively weak creature.\r\n\r\nThe slight corporeal strength of man, his little speed, his want of\r\nnatural weapons, &c., are more than counterbalanced, firstly by his\r\nintellectual powers, through which he has, whilst still remaining in a\r\nbarbarous state, formed for himself weapons, tools, &c., and secondly by\r\nhis social qualities which lead him to give aid to his fellow-men and to\r\nreceive it in return. No country in the world abounds in a greater\r\ndegree with dangerous beasts than Southern Africa; no country presents\r\nmore fearful physical hardships than the Arctic regions; yet one of the\r\npuniest races, namely, the Bushmen, maintain themselves in Southern\r\nAfrica, as do the dwarfed Esquimaux in the Arctic regions. The early\r\nprogenitors of man were, no doubt, inferior in intellect, and probably\r\nin social disposition, to the lowest existing savages; but it is quite\r\nconceivable that they might have existed, or even flourished, if, whilst\r\nthey gradually lost their brute-like powers, such as climbing trees,\r\n&c., they at the same time advanced in intellect. But granting that the\r\nprogenitors of man were far more helpless and defenceless than any\r\nexisting savages, if they had inhabited some warm continent or large\r\nisland, such as Australia or New Guinea, or Borneo (the latter island\r\nbeing now tenanted by the orang), they would not have been exposed to\r\nany special danger. In an area as large as one of these islands, the\r\ncompetition between tribe and tribe would have been sufficient, under\r\nfavourable conditions, to have raised man, through the survival of the\r\nfittest, combined with the inherited effects of habit, to his present\r\nhigh position in the organic scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL FACULTIES DURING\r\nPRIMEVAL AND CIVILISED TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The advancement of the intellectual powers through natural\r\n  selection--Importance of imitation--Social and moral\r\n  faculties--Their development within the limits of the same\r\n  tribe--Natural selection as affecting civilised\r\n  nations--Evidence that civilised nations were once barbarous.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjects to be discussed in this chapter are of the highest\r\ninterest, but are treated by me in a most imperfect and fragmentary\r\nmanner. Mr. Wallace, in an admirable paper before referred to,[221]\r\nargues that man after he had partially acquired those intellectual and\r\nmoral faculties which distinguish him from the lower animals, would have\r\nbeen but little liable to have had his bodily structure modified through\r\nnatural selection or any other means. For man is enabled through his\r\nmental faculties \"to keep with an unchanged body in harmony with the\r\nchanging universe.\" He has great power of adapting his habits to new\r\nconditions of life. He invents weapons, tools and various stratagems, by\r\nwhich he procures food and defends himself. When he migrates into a\r\ncolder climate he uses clothes, builds sheds, and makes fires; and, by\r\nthe aid of fire, cooks food otherwise indigestible. He aids his\r\nfellow-men in many ways, and anticipates future events. Even at a remote\r\nperiod he practised some subdivision of labour.\r\n\r\nThe lower animals, on the other hand, must have their bodily structure\r\nmodified in order to survive under greatly changed conditions. They must\r\nbe rendered stronger, or acquire more effective teeth or claws, in order\r\nto defend themselves from new enemies; or they must be reduced in size\r\nso as to escape detection and danger. When they migrate into a colder\r\nclimate they must become clothed with thicker fur, or have their\r\nconstitutions altered. If they fail to be thus modified, they will cease\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, is widely different, as Mr. Wallace has with justice\r\ninsisted, in relation to the intellectual and moral faculties of man.\r\nThese faculties are variable; and we have every reason to believe that\r\nthe variations tend to be inherited. Therefore, if they were formerly of\r\nhigh importance to primeval man and to his ape-like progenitors, they\r\nwould have been perfected or advanced through natural selection. Of the\r\nhigh importance of the intellectual faculties there can be no doubt, for\r\nman mainly owes to them his preeminent position in the world. We can\r\nsee that, in the rudest state of society, the individuals who were the\r\nmost sagacious, who invented and used the best weapons or traps, and who\r\nwere best able to defend themselves, would rear the greatest number of\r\noffspring. The tribes which included the largest number of men thus\r\nendowed would increase in number and supplant other tribes. Numbers\r\ndepend primarily on the means of subsistence, and this, partly on the\r\nphysical nature of the country, but in a much higher degree on the arts\r\nwhich are there practised. As a tribe increases and is victorious, it is\r\noften still further increased by the absorption of other tribes.[222]\r\nThe stature and strength of the men of a tribe are likewise of some\r\nimportance for its success, and these depend in part on the nature and\r\namount of the food which can be obtained. In Europe the men of the\r\nBronze period were supplanted by a more powerful and, judging from their\r\nsword-handles, larger-handed race;[223] but their success was probably\r\ndue in a much higher degree to their superiority in the arts.\r\n\r\nAll that we know about savages, or may infer from their traditions and\r\nfrom old monuments, the history of which is quite forgotten by the\r\npresent inhabitants, shew that from the remotest times successful tribes\r\nhave supplanted other tribes. Relics of extinct or forgotten tribes have\r\nbeen discovered throughout the civilised regions of the earth, on the\r\nwild plains of America, and on the isolated islands in the Pacific\r\nOcean. At the present day civilised nations are everywhere supplanting\r\nbarbarous nations, excepting where the climate opposes a deadly barrier;\r\nand they succeed mainly, though not exclusively, through their arts,\r\nwhich are the products of the intellect. It is, therefore, highly\r\nprobable that with mankind the intellectual faculties have been\r\ngradually perfected through natural selection; and this conclusion is\r\nsufficient for our purpose. Undoubtedly it would have been very\r\ninteresting to have traced the development of each separate faculty from\r\nthe state in which it exists in the lower animals to that in which it\r\nexists in man; but neither my ability nor knowledge permit the attempt.\r\n\r\nIt deserves notice that as soon as the progenitors of man became social\r\n(and this probably occurred at a very early period), the advancement of\r\nthe intellectual faculties will have been aided and modified in an\r\nimportant manner, of which we see only traces in the lower animals,\r\nnamely, through the principle of imitation, together with reason and\r\nexperience. Apes are much given to imitation, as are the lowest savages;\r\nand the simple fact previously referred to, that after a time no animal\r\ncan be caught in the same place by the same sort of trap, shews that\r\nanimals learn by experience, and imitate each others' caution. Now, if\r\nsome one man in a tribe, more sagacious than the others, invented a new\r\nsnare or weapon, or other means of attack or defence, the plainest\r\nself-interest, without the assistance of much reasoning power, would\r\nprompt the other members to imitate him; and all would thus profit. The\r\nhabitual practice of each new art must likewise in some slight degree\r\nstrengthen the intellect. If the new invention were an important one,\r\nthe tribe would increase in number, spread, and supplant other tribes.\r\nIn a tribe thus rendered more numerous there would always be a rather\r\nbetter chance of the birth of other superior and inventive members. If\r\nsuch men left children to inherit their mental superiority, the chance\r\nof the birth of still more ingenious members would be somewhat better,\r\nand in a very small tribe decidedly better. Even if they left no\r\nchildren, the tribe would still include their blood-relations; and it\r\nhas been ascertained by agriculturists[224] that by preserving and\r\nbreeding from the family of an animal, which when slaughtered was found\r\nto be valuable, the desired character has been obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning now to the social and moral faculties. In order that primeval\r\nmen, or the ape-like progenitors of man, should have become social, they\r\nmust have acquired the same instinctive feelings which impel other\r\nanimals to live in a body; and they no doubt exhibited the same general\r\ndisposition. They would have felt uneasy when separated from their\r\ncomrades, for whom they would have felt some degree of love; they would\r\nhave warned each other of danger, and have given mutual aid in attack or\r\ndefence. All this implies some degree of sympathy, fidelity, and\r\ncourage. Such social qualities, the paramount importance of which to the\r\nlower animals is disputed by no one, were no doubt acquired by the\r\nprogenitors of man in a similar manner, namely, through natural\r\nselection, aided by inherited habit. When two tribes of primeval man,\r\nliving in the same country, came into competition, if the one tribe\r\nincluded (other circumstances being equal) a greater number of\r\ncourageous, sympathetic, and faithful members, who were always ready to\r\nwarn each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe\r\nwould without doubt succeed best and conquer the other. Let it be borne\r\nin mind how all-important, in the never-ceasing wars of savages,\r\nfidelity and courage must be. The advantage which disciplined soldiers\r\nhave over undisciplined hordes follows chiefly from the confidence which\r\neach man feels in his comrades. Obedience, as Mr. Bagehot has well\r\nshewn,[225] is of the highest value, for any form of government is\r\nbetter than none. Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and\r\nwithout coherence nothing can be effected. A tribe possessing the above\r\nqualities in a high degree would spread and be victorious over other\r\ntribes; but in the course of time it would, judging from all past\r\nhistory, be in its turn overcome by some other and still more highly\r\nendowed tribe. Thus the social and moral qualities would tend slowly to\r\nadvance and be diffused throughout the world.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, how within the limits of the same tribe did a large\r\nnumber of members first become endowed with these social and moral\r\nqualities, and how was the standard of excellence raised? It is\r\nextremely doubtful whether the offspring of the more sympathetic and\r\nbenevolent parents, or of those which were the most faithful to their\r\ncomrades, would be reared in greater number than the children of selfish\r\nand treacherous parents of the same tribe. He who was ready to sacrifice\r\nhis life, as many a savage has been, rather than betray his comrades,\r\nwould often leave no offspring to inherit his noble nature. The bravest\r\nmen, who were always willing to come to the front in war, and who freely\r\nrisked their lives for others, would on an average perish in larger\r\nnumber than other men. Therefore it seems scarcely possible (bearing in\r\nmind that we are not here speaking of one tribe being victorious over\r\nanother) that the number of men gifted with such virtues, or that the\r\nstandard of their excellence, could be increased through natural\r\nselection, that is, by the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nAlthough the circumstances which lead to an increase in the number of\r\nmen thus endowed within the same tribe are too complex to be clearly\r\nfollowed out, we can trace some of the probable steps. In the first\r\nplace, as the reasoning powers and foresight of the members became\r\nimproved, each man would soon learn from experience that if he aided his\r\nfellow-men, he would commonly receive aid in return. From this low\r\nmotive he might acquire the habit of aiding his fellows; and the habit\r\nof performing benevolent actions certainly strengthens the feeling of\r\nsympathy, which gives the first impulse to benevolent actions. Habits,\r\nmoreover, followed during many generations probably tend to be\r\ninherited.\r\n\r\nBut there is another and much more powerful stimulus to the development\r\nof the social virtues, namely, the praise and the blame of our\r\nfellow-men. The love of approbation and the dread of infamy, as well as\r\nthe bestowal of praise or blame, are primarily due, as we have seen in\r\nthe third chapter, to the instinct of sympathy; and this instinct no\r\ndoubt was originally acquired, like all the other social instincts,\r\nthrough natural selection. At how early a period the progenitors of man,\r\nin the course of their development, became capable of feeling and being\r\nimpelled by the praise or blame of their fellow-creatures, we cannot, of\r\ncourse, say. But it appears that even dogs appreciate encouragement,\r\npraise, and blame. The rudest savages feel the sentiment of glory, as\r\nthey clearly show by preserving the trophies of their prowess, by their\r\nhabit of excessive boasting, and even by the extreme care which they\r\ntake of their personal appearance and decorations; for unless they\r\nregarded the opinion of their comrades, such habits would be senseless.\r\n\r\nThey certainly feel shame at the breach of some of their lesser rules;\r\nbut how far they experience remorse is doubtful. I was at first\r\nsurprised that I could not recollect any recorded instances of this\r\nfeeling in savages; and Sir J. Lubbock[226] states that he knows of\r\nnone. But if we banish from our minds all cases given in novels and\r\nplays and in death-bed confessions made to priests, I doubt whether many\r\nof us have actually witnessed remorse; though we may have often seen\r\nshame and contrition for smaller offences. Remorse is a deeply hidden\r\nfeeling. It is incredible that a savage, who will sacrifice his life\r\nrather than betray his tribe, or one who will deliver himself up as a\r\nprisoner rather than break his parole,[227] would not feel remorse in\r\nhis inmost soul, though he might conceal it, if he had failed in a duty\r\nwhich he held sacred.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore conclude that primeval man, at a very remote period,\r\nwould have been influenced by the praise and blame of his fellows. It is\r\nobvious, that the members of the same tribe would approve of conduct\r\nwhich appeared to them to be for the general good, and would reprobate\r\nthat which appeared evil. To do good unto others--to do unto others as\r\nye would they should do unto you,--is the foundation-stone of morality.\r\nIt is, therefore, hardly possible to exaggerate the importance during\r\nrude times of the love of praise and the dread of blame. A man who was\r\nnot impelled by any deep, instinctive feeling, to sacrifice his life for\r\nthe good of others, yet was roused to such actions by a sense of glory,\r\nwould by his example excite the same wish for glory in other men, and\r\nwould strengthen by exercise the noble feeling of admiration. He might\r\nthus do far more good to his tribe than by begetting offspring with a\r\ntendency to inherit his own high character.\r\n\r\nWith increased experience and reason, man perceives the more remote\r\nconsequences of his actions, and the self-regarding virtues, such as\r\ntemperance, chastity, &c., which during early times are, as we have\r\nbefore seen, utterly disregarded, come to be highly esteemed or even\r\nheld sacred. I need not, however, repeat what I have said on this head\r\nin the third chapter. Ultimately a highly complex sentiment, having its\r\nfirst origin in the social instincts, largely guided by the approbation\r\nof our fellow-men, ruled by reason, self-interest, and in later times by\r\ndeep religious feelings, confirmed by instruction and habit, all\r\ncombined, constitute our moral sense or conscience.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that although a high standard of morality gives\r\nbut a slight or no advantage to each individual man and his children\r\nover the other men of the same tribe, yet that an advancement in the\r\nstandard of morality and an increase in the number of well-endowed men\r\nwill certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe over another.\r\nThere can be no doubt that a tribe including many members who, from\r\npossessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity,\r\nobedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to give aid to each\r\nother and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be\r\nvictorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection.\r\nAt all times throughout the world tribes have supplanted other tribes;\r\nand as morality is one element in their success, the standard of\r\nmorality and the number of well-endowed men will thus everywhere tend to\r\nrise and increase.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, very difficult to form any judgment why one particular\r\ntribe and not another has been successful and has risen in the scale of\r\ncivilisation. Many savages are in the same condition as when first\r\ndiscovered several centuries ago. As Mr. Bagehot has remarked, we are\r\napt to look at progress as the normal rule in human society; but history\r\nrefutes this. The ancients did not even entertain the idea; nor do the\r\noriental nations at the present day. According to another high\r\nauthority, Mr. Maine,[228] \"the greatest part of mankind has never\r\nshewn a particle of desire that its civil institutions should be\r\nimproved.\" Progress seems to depend on many concurrent favourable\r\nconditions, far too complex to be followed out. But it has often been\r\nremarked, that a cool climate from leading to industry and the various\r\narts has been highly favourable, or even indispensable for this end. The\r\nEsquimaux, pressed by hard necessity, have succeeded in many ingenious\r\ninventions, but their climate has been too severe for continued\r\nprogress. Nomadic habits, whether over wide plains, or through the dense\r\nforests of the tropics, or along the shores of the sea, have in every\r\ncase been highly detrimental. Whilst observing the barbarous inhabitants\r\nof Tierra del Fuego, it struck me that the possession of some property,\r\na fixed abode, and the union of many families under a chief, were the\r\nindispensable requisites for civilisation. Such habits almost\r\nnecessitate the cultivation of the ground; and the first steps in\r\ncultivation would probably result, as I have elsewhere shewn,[229] from\r\nsome such accident as the seeds of a fruit-tree falling on a heap of\r\nrefuse and producing an unusually fine variety. The problem, however, of\r\nthe first advance of savages towards civilisation is at present much too\r\ndifficult to be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Selection as affecting Civilised Nations._--In the last and\r\npresent chapters I have considered the advancement of man from a former\r\nsemi-human condition to his present state as a barbarian. But some\r\nremarks on the agency of natural selection on civilised nations may be\r\nhere worth adding. This subject has been ably discussed by Mr. W. R.\r\nGreg,[230] and previously by Mr. Wallace and Mr. Galton.[231] Most of\r\nmy remarks are taken from these three authors. With savages, the weak in\r\nbody or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly\r\nexhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on the other hand,\r\ndo our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for\r\nthe imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our\r\nmedical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to\r\nthe last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has\r\npreserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have\r\nsuccumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies\r\npropagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of\r\ndomestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the\r\nrace of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly\r\ndirected, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in\r\nthe case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his\r\nworst animals to breed.\r\n\r\nThe aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an\r\nincidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally\r\nacquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in\r\nthe manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused.\r\nNor could we check our sympathy, if so urged by hard reason, without\r\ndeterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden\r\nhimself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting\r\nfor the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the\r\nweak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with a\r\ncertain and great present evil. Hence we must bear without complaining\r\nthe undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their\r\nkind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action,\r\nnamely the weaker and inferior members of society not marrying so freely\r\nas the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased, though\r\nthis is more to be hoped for than expected, by the weak in body or mind\r\nrefraining from marriage.\r\n\r\nIn all civilised countries man accumulates property and bequeaths it to\r\nhis children. So that the children in the same country do not by any\r\nmeans start fair in the race for success. But this is far from an\r\nunmixed evil; for without the accumulation of capital the arts could not\r\nprogress; and it is chiefly through their power that the civilised races\r\nhave extended, and are now everywhere extending, their range, so as to\r\ntake the place of the lower races. Nor does the moderate accumulation of\r\nwealth interfere with the process of selection. When a poor man becomes\r\nrich, his children enter trades or professions in which there is\r\nstruggle enough, so that the able in body and mind succeed best. The\r\npresence of a body of well-instructed men, who have not to labour for\r\ntheir daily bread, is important to a degree which cannot be\r\nover-estimated; as all high intellectual work is carried on by them, and\r\non such work material progress of all kinds mainly depends, not to\r\nmention other and higher advantages. No doubt wealth when very great\r\ntends to convert men into useless drones, but their number is never\r\nlarge; and some degree of elimination here occurs, as we daily see rich\r\nmen, who happen to be fools or profligate, squandering away all their\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nPrimogeniture with entailed estates is a more direct evil, though it may\r\nformerly have been a great advantage by the creation of a dominant\r\nclass, and any government is better than anarchy. The eldest sons,\r\nthough they may be weak in body or mind, generally marry, whilst the\r\nyounger sons, however superior in these respects, do not so generally\r\nmarry. Nor can worthless eldest sons with entailed estates squander\r\ntheir wealth. But here, as elsewhere, the relations of civilised life\r\nare so complex that some compensatory checks intervene. The men who are\r\nrich through primogeniture are able to select generation after\r\ngeneration the more beautiful and charming women; and these must\r\ngenerally be healthy in body and active in mind. The evil consequences,\r\nsuch as they may be, of the continued preservation of the same line of\r\ndescent, without any selection, are checked by men of rank always\r\nwishing to increase their wealth and power; and this they effect by\r\nmarrying heiresses. But the daughters of parents who have produced\r\nsingle children, are themselves, as Mr. Galton has shewn,[232] apt to be\r\nsterile; and thus noble families are continually cut off in the direct\r\nline, and their wealth flows into some side channel; but unfortunately\r\nthis channel is not determined by superiority of any kind.\r\n\r\nAlthough civilisation thus checks in many ways the action of natural\r\nselection, it apparently favours, by means of improved food and the\r\nfreedom from occasional hardships, the better development of the body.\r\nThis may be inferred from civilised men having been found, wherever\r\ncompared, to be physically stronger than savages. They appear also to\r\nhave equal powers of endurance, as has been proved in many adventurous\r\nexpeditions. Even the great luxury of the rich can be but little\r\ndetrimental; for the expectation of life of our aristocracy, at all ages\r\nand of both sexes, is very little inferior to that of healthy English\r\nlives in the lower classes.[233]\r\n\r\nWe will now look to the intellectual faculties alone. If in each grade\r\nof society the members were divided into two equal bodies, the one\r\nincluding the intellectually superior and the other the inferior, there\r\ncan be little doubt that the former would succeed best in all\r\noccupations and rear a greater number of children. Even in the lowest\r\nwalks of life, skill and ability must be of some advantage, though in\r\nmany occupations, owing to the great division of labour, a very small\r\none. Hence in civilised nations there will be some tendency to an\r\nincrease both in the number and in the standard of the intellectually\r\nable. But I do not wish to assert that this tendency may not be more\r\nthan counterbalanced in other ways, as by the multiplication of the\r\nreckless and improvident; but even to such as these, ability must be\r\nsome advantage.\r\n\r\nIt has often been objected to views like the foregoing, that the most\r\neminent men who have ever lived have left no offspring to inherit their\r\ngreat intellect. Mr. Galton says,[234] \"I regret I am unable to solve\r\nthe simple question whether, and how far, men and women who are\r\nprodigies of genius are infertile. I have, however, shewn that men of\r\neminence are by no means so.\"\r\n\r\nGreat lawgivers, the founders of beneficent religions, great\r\nphilosophers and discoverers in science, aid the progress of mankind in\r\na far higher degree by their works than by leaving a numerous progeny.\r\nIn the case of corporeal structures, it is the selection of the slightly\r\nbetter-endowed and the elimination of the slightly less well-endowed\r\nindividuals, and not the preservation of strongly-marked and rare\r\nanomalies, that leads to the advancement of a species.[235] So it will\r\nbe with the intellectual faculties, namely from the somewhat more able\r\nmen in each grade of society succeeding rather better than the less\r\nable, and consequently increasing in number, if not otherwise prevented.\r\nWhen in any nation the standard of intellect and the number of\r\nintellectual men have increased, we may expect from the law of the\r\ndeviation from an average, as shewn by Mr. Galton, that prodigies of\r\ngenius will appear somewhat more frequently than before.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the moral qualities, some elimination of the worst\r\ndispositions is always in progress even in the most civilised nations.\r\nMalefactors are executed, or imprisoned for long periods, so that they\r\ncannot freely transmit their bad qualities. Melancholic and insane\r\npersons are confined, or commit suicide. Violent and quarrelsome men\r\noften come to a bloody end. Restless men who will not follow any steady\r\noccupation--and this relic of barbarism is a great check to\r\ncivilisation[236]--emigrate to newly-settled countries, where they prove\r\nuseful pioneers. Intemperance is so highly destructive, that the\r\nexpectation of life of the intemperate, at the age, for instance, of\r\nthirty, is only 13.8 years; whilst for the rural labourers of England at\r\nthe same age it is 40.59 years.[237] Profligate women bear few children,\r\nand profligate men rarely marry; both suffer from disease. In the\r\nbreeding of domestic animals, the elimination of those individuals,\r\nthough few in number, which are in any marked manner inferior, is by no\r\nmeans an unimportant element towards success. This especially holds good\r\nwith injurious characters which tend to reappear through reversion, such\r\nas blackness in sheep; and with mankind some of the worst dispositions,\r\nwhich occasionally without any assignable cause make their appearance in\r\nfamilies, may perhaps be reversions to a savage state, from which we are\r\nnot removed by very many generations. This view seems indeed recognised\r\nin the common expression that such men are the black sheep of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nWith civilised nations, as far as an advanced standard of morality, and\r\nan increased number of fairly well-endowed men are concerned, natural\r\nselection apparently effects but little; though the fundamental social\r\ninstincts were originally thus gained. But I have already said enough,\r\nwhilst treating of the lower races, on the causes which lead to the\r\nadvance of morality, namely, the approbation of our fellow-men--the\r\nstrengthening of our sympathies by habit--example and imitation--\r\nreason--experience and even self-interest--instruction during\r\nyouth, and religious feelings.\r\n\r\nA most important obstacle in civilised countries to an increase in the\r\nnumber of men of a superior class has been strongly urged by Mr. Greg\r\nand Mr. Galton,[238] namely, the fact that the very poor and reckless,\r\nwho are often degraded by vice, almost invariably marry early, whilst\r\nthe careful and frugal, who are generally otherwise virtuous, marry late\r\nin life, so that they may be able to support themselves and their\r\nchildren in comfort. Those who marry early produce within a given period\r\nnot only a greater number of generations, but, as shewn by Dr.\r\nDuncan,[239] they produce many more children. The children, moreover,\r\nthat are born by mothers during the prime of life are heavier and\r\nlarger, and therefore probably more vigorous, than those born at other\r\nperiods. Thus the reckless, degraded, and often vicious members of\r\nsociety, tend to increase at a quicker rate than the provident and\r\ngenerally virtuous members. Or as Mr. Greg puts the case: \"The careless,\r\nsqualid, unaspiring Irishman multiplies like rabbits: the frugal,\r\nforeseeing, self-respecting, ambitious Scot, stern in his morality,\r\nspiritual in his faith, sagacious and disciplined in his intelligence,\r\npasses his best years in struggle and in celibacy, marries late, and\r\nleaves few behind him. Given a land originally peopled by a thousand\r\nSaxons and a thousand Celts--and in a dozen generations five-sixths of\r\nthe population would be Celts, but five-sixths of the property, of the\r\npower, of the intellect, would belong to the one-sixth of Saxons that\r\nremained. In the eternal 'struggle for existence,' it would be the\r\ninferior and _less_ favoured race that had prevailed--and prevailed by\r\nvirtue not of its good qualities but of its faults.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some checks to this downward tendency. We have seen\r\nthat the intemperate suffer from a high rate of mortality, and the\r\nextremely profligate leave few offspring. The poorest classes crowd into\r\ntowns, and it has been proved by Dr. Stark from the statistics of ten\r\nyears in Scotland,[240] that at all ages the death-rate is higher in\r\ntowns than in rural districts, \"and during the first five years of life\r\nthe town death-rate is almost exactly double that of the rural\r\ndistricts.\" As these returns include both the rich and the poor, no\r\ndoubt more than double the number of births would be requisite to keep\r\nup the number of the very poor inhabitants in the towns, relatively to\r\nthose in the country. With women, marriage at too early an age is highly\r\ninjurious; for it has been found in France that, \"twice as many wives\r\nunder twenty die in the year, as died out of the same number of the\r\nunmarried.\" The mortality, also, of husbands under twenty is\r\n\"excessively high,\"[241] but what the cause of this may be seems\r\ndoubtful. Lastly, if the men who prudently delay marrying until they can\r\nbring up their families in comfort, were to select, as they often do,\r\nwomen in the prime of life, the rate of increase in the better class\r\nwould be only slightly lessened.\r\n\r\nIt was established from an enormous body of statistics, taken during\r\n1853, that the unmarried men throughout France, between the ages of\r\ntwenty and eighty, die in a much larger proportion than the married: for\r\ninstance, out of every 1000 unmarried men, between the ages of twenty\r\nand thirty, 11.3 annually died, whilst of the married only 6.5\r\ndied.[242] A similar law was proved to hold good, during the years 1863\r\nand 1864, with the entire population above the age of twenty in\r\nScotland: for instance, out of every 1000 unmarried men, between the\r\nages of twenty and thirty, 14.97 annually died, whilst of the married\r\nonly 7.24 died, that is less than half.[243] Dr. Stark remarks on this,\r\n\"Bachelorhood is more destructive to life than the most unwholesome\r\ntrades, or than residence in an unwholesome house or district where\r\nthere has never been the most distant attempt at sanitary improvement.\"\r\nHe considers that the lessened mortality is the direct result of\r\n\"marriage, and the more regular domestic habits which attend that\r\nstate.\" He admits, however, that the intemperate, profligate, and\r\ncriminal classes, whose duration of life is low, do not commonly marry;\r\nand it must likewise be admitted that men with a weak constitution,\r\nill health, or any great infirmity in body or mind, will often not wish\r\nto marry, or will be rejected. Dr. Stark seems to have come to the\r\nconclusion that marriage in itself is a main cause of prolonged life,\r\nfrom finding that aged married men still have a considerable advantage\r\nin this respect over the unmarried of the same advanced age; but every\r\none must have known instances of men, who with weak health during youth\r\ndid not marry, and yet have survived to old age, though remaining weak\r\nand therefore always with a lessened chance of life. There is another\r\nremarkable circumstance which seems to support Dr. Stark's conclusion,\r\nnamely, that widows and widowers in France suffer in comparison with the\r\nmarried a very heavy rate of mortality; but Dr. Farr attributes this to\r\nthe poverty and evil habits consequent on the disruption of the family,\r\nand to grief. On the whole we may conclude with Dr. Farr that the lesser\r\nmortality of married than of unmarried men, which seems to be a general\r\nlaw, \"is mainly due to the constant elimination of imperfect types, and\r\nto the skilful selection of the finest individuals out of each\r\nsuccessive generation;\" the selection relating only to the marriage\r\nstate, and acting on all corporeal, intellectual, and moral qualities.\r\nWe may, therefore, infer that sound and good men who out of prudence\r\nremain for a time unmarried do not suffer a high rate of mortality.\r\n\r\nIf the various checks specified in the two last paragraphs, and perhaps\r\nothers as yet unknown, do not prevent the reckless, the vicious and\r\notherwise inferior members of society from increasing at a quicker rate\r\nthan the better class of men, the nation will retrograde, as has\r\noccurred too often in the history of the world. We must remember that\r\nprogress is no invariable rule. It is most difficult to say why one\r\ncivilised nation rises, becomes more powerful, and spreads more widely,\r\nthan another; or why the same nation progresses more at one time than at\r\nanother. We can only say that it depends on an increase in the actual\r\nnumber of the population, on the number of the men endowed with high\r\nintellectual and moral faculties, as well as on their standard of\r\nexcellence. Corporeal structure, except so far as vigour of body leads\r\nto vigour of mind, appears to have little influence.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged by several writers that as high intellectual powers\r\nare advantageous to a nation, the old Greeks, who stood some grades\r\nhigher in intellect than any race that has ever existed,[244] ought to\r\nhave risen, if the power of natural selection were real, still higher\r\nin the scale, increased in number, and stocked the whole of Europe. Here\r\nwe have the tacit assumption, so often made with respect to corporeal\r\nstructures, that there is some innate tendency towards continued\r\ndevelopment in mind and body. But development of all kinds depends on\r\nmany concurrent favourable circumstances. Natural selection acts only in\r\na tentative manner. Individuals and races may have acquired certain\r\nindisputable advantages, and yet have perished from failing in other\r\ncharacters. The Greeks may have retrograded from a want of coherence\r\nbetween the many small states, from the small size of their whole\r\ncountry, from the practice of slavery, or from extreme sensuality; for\r\nthey did not succumb until \"they were enervated and corrupt to the very\r\ncore.\"[245] The western nations of Europe, who now so immeasurably\r\nsurpass their former savage progenitors and stand at the summit of\r\ncivilisation, owe little or none of their superiority to direct\r\ninheritance from the old Greeks; though they owe much to the written\r\nworks of this wonderful people.\r\n\r\nWho can positively say why the Spanish nation, so dominant at one time,\r\nhas been distanced in the race. The awakening of the nations of Europe\r\nfrom the dark ages is a still more perplexing problem. At this early\r\nperiod, as Mr. Galton[246] has remarked, almost all the men of a gentle\r\nnature, those given to meditation or culture of the mind, had no refuge\r\nexcept in the bosom of the Church which demanded celibacy; and this\r\ncould hardly fail to have had a deteriorating influence on each\r\nsuccessive generation. During this same period the Holy Inquisition\r\nselected with extreme care the freest and boldest men in order to burn\r\nor imprison them. In Spain alone some of the best men--those who doubted\r\nand questioned, and without doubting there can be no progress--were\r\neliminated during three centuries at the rate of a thousand a year. The\r\nevil which the Catholic Church has thus effected, though no doubt\r\ncounterbalanced to a certain, perhaps large extent in other ways, is\r\nincalculable; nevertheless, Europe has progressed at an unparalleled\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable success of the English as colonists over other European\r\nnations, which is well illustrated by comparing the progress of the\r\nCanadians of English and French extraction, has been ascribed to their\r\n\"daring and persistent energy;\" but who can say how the English gained\r\ntheir energy. There is apparently much truth in the belief that the\r\nwonderful progress of the United States, as well as the character of the\r\npeople, are the results of natural selection; the more energetic,\r\nrestless, and courageous men from all parts of Europe having emigrated\r\nduring the last ten or twelve generations to that great country, and\r\nhaving there succeeded best.[247] Looking to the distant future, I do\r\nnot think that the Rev. Mr. Zincke takes an exaggerated view when he\r\nsays:[248] \"All other series of events--as that which resulted in the\r\nculture of mind in Greece, and that which resulted in the empire of\r\nRome--only appear to have purpose and value when viewed in connection\r\nwith, or rather as subsidiary to ... the great stream of Anglo-Saxon\r\nemigration to the west.\"\r\n\r\nObscure as is the problem of the advance of civilisation, we can at\r\nleast see that a nation which produced during a lengthened period the\r\ngreatest number of highly intellectual, energetic, brave, patriotic, and\r\nbenevolent men, would generally prevail over less favoured nations.\r\n\r\nNatural selection follows from the struggle for existence; and this from\r\na rapid rate of increase. It is impossible not bitterly to regret, but\r\nwhether wisely is another question, the rate at which man tends to\r\nincrease; for this leads in barbarous tribes to infanticide and many\r\nother evils, and in civilised nations to abject poverty, celibacy, and\r\nto the late marriages of the prudent. But as man suffers from the same\r\nphysical evils with the lower animals, he has no right to expect an\r\nimmunity from the evils consequent on the struggle for existence. Had he\r\nnot been subjected to natural selection, assuredly he would never have\r\nattained to the rank of manhood. When we see in many parts of the world\r\nenormous areas of the most fertile land peopled by a few wandering\r\nsavages, but which are capable of supporting numerous happy homes, it\r\nmight be argued that the struggle for existence had not been\r\nsufficiently severe to force man upwards to his highest standard.\r\nJudging from all that we know of man and the lower animals, there has\r\nalways been sufficient variability in the intellectual and moral\r\nfaculties, for their steady advancement through natural selection. No\r\ndoubt such advancement demands many favourable concurrent circumstances;\r\nbut it may well be doubted whether the most favourable would have\r\nsufficed, had not the rate of increase been rapid, and the consequent\r\nstruggle for existence severe to an extreme degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the evidence that all civilised nations were once barbarous._--As we\r\nhave had to consider the steps by which some semi-human creature has\r\nbeen gradually raised to the rank of man in his most perfect state, the\r\npresent subject cannot be quite passed over. But it has been treated in\r\nso full and admirable a manner by Sir J. Lubbock,[249] Mr. Tylor, Mr.\r\nM'Lennan, and others, that I need here give only the briefest summary of\r\ntheir results. The arguments recently advanced by the Duke of\r\nArgyll[250] and formerly by Archbishop Whately, in favour of the belief\r\nthat man came into the world as a civilised being and that all savages\r\nhave since undergone degradation, seem to me weak in comparison with\r\nthose advanced on the other side. Many nations, no doubt, have fallen\r\naway in civilisation, and some may have lapsed into utter barbarism,\r\nthough on this latter head I have not met with any evidence. The\r\nFuegians were probably compelled by other conquering hordes to settle in\r\ntheir inhospitable country, and they may have become in consequence\r\nsomewhat more degraded; but it would be difficult to prove that they\r\nhave fallen much below the Botocudos who inhabit the finest parts of\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nThe evidence that all civilised nations are the descendants of\r\nbarbarians, consists, on the one side, of clear traces of their former\r\nlow condition in still-existing customs, beliefs, language, &c.; and on\r\nthe other side, of proofs that savages are independently able to raise\r\nthemselves a few steps in the scale of civilisation, and have actually\r\nthus risen. The evidence on the first head is extremely curious, but\r\ncannot be here given: I refer to such cases as that, for instance, of\r\nthe art of enumeration, which, as Mr. Tylor clearly shews by the words\r\nstill used in some places, originated in counting the fingers, first of\r\none hand and then of the other, and lastly of the toes. We have traces\r\nof this in our own decimal system, and in the Roman numerals, which\r\nafter reaching to the number V., change into VI., &c., when the other\r\nhand no doubt was used. So again, \"when we speak of three-score and ten,\r\nwe are counting by the vigesimal system, each score thus ideally made,\r\nstanding for 20--for 'one man' as a Mexican or Carib would put it.\"[251]\r\nAccording to a large and increasing school of philologists, every\r\nlanguage bears the marks of its slow and gradual evolution. So it is\r\nwith the art of writing, as letters are rudiments of pictorial\r\nrepresentations. It is hardly possible to read Mr. M'Lennan's work[252]\r\nand not admit that almost all civilised nations still retain some traces\r\nof such rude habits as the forcible capture of wives. What ancient\r\nnation, as the same author asks, can be named that was originally\r\nmonogamous? The primitive idea of justice, as shewn by the law of battle\r\nand other customs of which traces still remain, was likewise most rude.\r\nMany existing superstitions are the remnants of former false religious\r\nbeliefs. The highest form of religion--the grand idea of God hating sin\r\nand loving righteousness--was unknown during primeval times.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other kind of evidence: Sir J. Lubbock has shewn that\r\nsome savages have recently improved a little in some of their simpler\r\narts. From the extremely curious account which he gives of the weapons,\r\ntools, and arts, used or practised by savages in various parts of the\r\nworld, it cannot be doubted that these have nearly all been independent\r\ndiscoveries, excepting perhaps the art of making fire.[253] The\r\nAustralian boomerang is a good instance of one such independent\r\ndiscovery. The Tahitians when first visited had advanced in many\r\nrespects beyond the inhabitants of most of the other Polynesian islands.\r\nThere are no just grounds for the belief that the high culture of the\r\nnative Peruvians and Mexicans was derived from any foreign source;[254]\r\nmany native plants were there cultivated, and a few native animals\r\ndomesticated. We should bear in mind that a wandering crew from some\r\nsemi-civilised land, if washed to the shores of America, would not,\r\njudging from the small influence of most missionaries, have produced any\r\nmarked effect on the natives, unless they had already become somewhat\r\nadvanced. Looking to a very remote period in the history of the world,\r\nwe find, to use Sir J. Lubbock's well-known terms, a paleolithic and\r\nneolithic period; and no one will pretend that the art of grinding rough\r\nflint tools was a borrowed one. In all parts of Europe, as far east as\r\nGreece, in Palestine, India, Japan, New Zealand, and Africa, including\r\nEgypt, flint tools have been discovered in abundance; and of their use\r\nthe existing inhabitants retain no tradition. There is also indirect\r\nevidence of their former use by the Chinese and ancient Jews. Hence\r\nthere can hardly be a doubt that the inhabitants of these many\r\ncountries, which include nearly the whole civilised world, were once in\r\na barbarous condition. To believe that man was aboriginally civilised\r\nand then suffered utter degradation in so many regions, is to take a\r\npitiably low view of human nature. It is apparently a truer and more\r\ncheerful view that progress has been much more general than\r\nretrogression; that man has risen, though by slow and interrupted steps,\r\nfrom a lowly condition to the highest standard as yet attained by him in\r\nknowledge, morals, and religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nON THE AFFINITIES AND GENEALOGY OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Position of man in the animal series--The natural system\r\n  genealogical--Adaptive characters of slight value--Various\r\n  small points of resemblance between man and the\r\n  Quadrumana--Rank of man in the natural system--Birthplace and\r\n  antiquity of man--Absence of fossil connecting-links--Lower\r\n  stages in the genealogy of man, as inferred, firstly from his\r\n  affinities and secondly from his structure--Early androgynous\r\n  condition of the Vertebrata--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if it be granted that the difference between man and his nearest\r\nallies is as great in corporeal structure as some naturalists maintain,\r\nand although we must grant that the difference between them is immense\r\nin mental power, yet the facts given in the previous chapters declare,\r\nas it appears to me, in the plainest manner, that man is descended from\r\nsome lower form, notwithstanding that connecting-links have not hitherto\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\nMan is liable to numerous, slight, and diversified variations, which are\r\ninduced by the same general causes, are governed and transmitted in\r\naccordance with the same general laws, as in the lower animals. Man\r\ntends to multiply at so rapid a rate that his offspring are necessarily\r\nexposed to a struggle for existence, and consequently to natural\r\nselection. He has given rise to many races, some of which are so\r\ndifferent that they have often been ranked by naturalists as distinct\r\nspecies. His body is constructed on the same homological plan as that of\r\nother mammals, independently of the uses to which the several parts may\r\nbe put. He passes through the same phases of embryological development.\r\nHe retains many rudimentary and useless structures, which no doubt were\r\nonce serviceable. Characters occasionally make their reappearance in\r\nhim, which we have every reason to believe were possessed by his early\r\nprogenitors. If the origin of man had been wholly different from that of\r\nall other animals, these various appearances would be mere empty\r\ndeceptions; but such an admission is incredible. These appearances, on\r\nthe other hand, are intelligible, at least to a large extent, if man is\r\nthe co-descendant with other mammals of some unknown and lower form.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists, from being deeply impressed with the mental and\r\nspiritual powers of man, have divided the whole organic world into three\r\nkingdoms, the Human, the Animal, and the Vegetable, thus giving to man a\r\nseparate kingdom.[255] Spiritual powers cannot be compared or classed by\r\nthe naturalist; but he may endeavour to shew, as I have done, that the\r\nmental faculties of man and the lower animals do not differ in kind,\r\nalthough immensely in degree. A difference in degree, however great,\r\ndoes not justify us in placing man in a distinct kingdom, as will\r\nperhaps be best illustrated by comparing the mental powers of two\r\ninsects, namely, a coccus or scale-insect and an ant, which undoubtedly\r\nbelong to the same class. The difference is here greater, though of a\r\nsomewhat different kind, than that between man and the highest mammal.\r\nThe female coccus, whilst young, attaches itself by its proboscis to a\r\nplant; sucks the sap but never moves again; is fertilised and lays eggs;\r\nand this is its whole history. On the other hand, to describe the habits\r\nand mental powers of a female ant, would require, as Pierre Huber has\r\nshewn, a large volume; I may, however, briefly specify a few points.\r\nAnts communicate information to each other, and several unite for the\r\nsame work, or games of play. They recognise their fellow-ants after\r\nmonths of absence. They build great edifices, keep them clean, close the\r\ndoors in the evening, and post sentries. They make roads, and even\r\ntunnels under rivers. They collect food for the community, and when an\r\nobject, too large for entrance, is brought to the nest, they enlarge the\r\ndoor, and afterwards build it up again.[256] They go out to battle in\r\nregular bands, and freely sacrifice their lives for the common weal.\r\nThey emigrate in accordance with a preconcerted plan. They capture\r\nslaves. They keep Aphides as milch-cows. They move the eggs of their\r\naphides, as well as their own eggs and cocoons, into warm parts of the\r\nnest, in order that they may be quickly hatched; and endless similar\r\nfacts could be given. On the whole, the difference in mental power\r\nbetween an ant and a coccus is immense; yet no one has ever dreamed of\r\nplacing them in distinct classes, much less in distinct kingdoms. No\r\ndoubt this interval is bridged over by the intermediate mental powers of\r\nmany other insects; and this is not the case with man and the higher\r\napes. But we have every reason to believe that breaks in the series are\r\nsimply the result of many forms having become extinct.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen, relying chiefly on the structure of the brain, has\r\ndivided the mammalian series into four sub-classes. One of these he\r\ndevotes to man; in another he places both the marsupials and the\r\nmonotremata; so that he makes man as distinct from all other mammals as\r\nare these two latter groups conjoined. This view has not been accepted,\r\nas far as I am aware, by any naturalist capable of forming an\r\nindependent judgment, and therefore need not here be further considered.\r\n\r\nWe can understand why a classification founded on any single character\r\nor organ--even an organ so wonderfully complex and important as the\r\nbrain--or on the high development of the mental faculties, is almost\r\nsure to prove unsatisfactory. This principle has indeed been tried with\r\nhymenopterous insects; but when thus classed by their habits or\r\ninstincts, the arrangement proved thoroughly artificial.[257]\r\nClassifications may, of course, be based on any character whatever, as\r\non size, colour, or the element inhabited; but naturalists have long\r\nfelt a profound conviction that there is a natural system. This system,\r\nit is now generally admitted, must be, as far as possible, genealogical\r\nin arrangement,--that is, the co-descendants of the same form must be\r\nkept together in one group, separate from the co-descendants of any\r\nother form; but if the parent-forms are related, so will be their\r\ndescendants, and the two groups together will form a larger group. The\r\namount of difference between the several groups--that is the amount of\r\nmodification which each has undergone--will be expressed by such terms\r\nas genera, families, orders, and classes. As we have no record of the\r\nlines of descent, these lines can be discovered only by observing the\r\ndegrees of resemblance between the beings which are to be classed. For\r\nthis object numerous points of resemblance are of much more importance\r\nthan the amount of similarity or dissimilarity in a few points. If two\r\nlanguages were found to resemble each other in a multitude of words and\r\npoints of construction, they would be universally recognised as having\r\nsprung from a common source, notwithstanding that they differed greatly\r\nin some few words or points of construction. But with organic beings the\r\npoints of resemblance must not consist of adaptations to similar habits\r\nof life: two animals may, for instance, have had their whole frames\r\nmodified for living in the water, and yet they will not be brought any\r\nnearer to each other in the natural system. Hence we can see how it is\r\nthat resemblances in unimportant structures, in useless and rudimentary\r\norgans, and in parts not as yet fully developed or functionally active,\r\nare by far the most serviceable for classification; for they can hardly\r\nbe due to adaptations within a late period; and thus they reveal the old\r\nlines of descent or of true affinity.\r\n\r\nWe can further see why a great amount of modification in some one\r\ncharacter ought not to lead us to separate widely any two organisms. A\r\npart which already differs much from the same part in other allied forms\r\nhas already, according to the theory of evolution, varied much;\r\nconsequently it would (as long as the organism remained exposed to the\r\nsame exciting conditions) be liable to further variations of the same\r\nkind; and these, if beneficial, would be preserved, and thus continually\r\naugmented. In many cases the continued development of a part, for\r\ninstance, of the beak of a bird, or of the teeth of a mammal, would not\r\nbe advantageous to the species for gaining its food, or for any other\r\nobject; but with man we can see no definite limit, as far as advantage\r\nis concerned, to the continued development of the brain and mental\r\nfaculties. Therefore in determining the position of man in the natural\r\nor genealogical system, the extreme development of his brain ought not\r\nto outweigh a multitude of resemblances in other less important or\r\nquite unimportant points.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the\r\nwhole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed\r\nBlumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under\r\nthe title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the Orders of\r\nthe Quadrumana, Carnivora, &c. Recently many of our best naturalists\r\nhave recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for\r\nhis sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana,\r\nunder the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be\r\nadmitted if, in the first place, we bear in mind the remarks just made\r\non the comparatively small importance for classification of the great\r\ndevelopment of the brain in man; bearing, also, in mind that the\r\nstrongly-marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana\r\n(lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow\r\nfrom their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must\r\nremember that nearly all the other and more important differences\r\nbetween man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature,\r\nand relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure\r\nof his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the\r\nposition of his head. The family of seals offers a good illustration of\r\nthe small importance of adaptive characters for classification. These\r\nanimals differ from all other Carnivora in the form of their bodies and\r\nin the structure of their limbs, far more than does man from the higher\r\napes; yet in every system, from that of Cuvier to the most recent one by\r\nMr. Flower,[258] seals are ranked as a mere family in the Order of the\r\nCarnivora. If man had not been his own classifier, he would never have\r\nthought of founding a separate order for his own reception.\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond my limits, and quite beyond my knowledge, even to\r\nname the innumerable points of structure in which man agrees with the\r\nother Primates. Our great anatomist and philosopher, Prof. Huxley, has\r\nfully discussed this subject,[259] and has come to the conclusion that\r\nman in all parts of his organisation differs less from the higher apes,\r\nthan these do from the lower members of the same group. Consequently\r\nthere \"is no justification for placing man in a distinct order.\"\r\n\r\nIn an early part of this volume I brought forward various facts, shewing\r\nhow closely man agrees in constitution with the higher mammals; and this\r\nagreement, no doubt, depends on our close similarity in minute structure\r\nand chemical composition. I gave, as instances, our liability to the\r\nsame diseases, and to the attacks of allied parasites; our tastes in\r\ncommon for the same stimulants, and the similar effects thus produced,\r\nas well as by various drugs; and other such facts.\r\n\r\nAs small unimportant points of resemblance between man and the higher\r\napes are not commonly noticed in systematic works, and as, when\r\nnumerous, they clearly reveal our relationship, I will specify a few\r\nsuch points. The relative position of the features are manifestly the\r\nsame in man and the Quadrumana; and the various emotions are displayed\r\nby nearly similar movements of the muscles and skin, chiefly above the\r\neyebrows and round the mouth. Some few expressions are, indeed, almost\r\nthe same, as in the weeping of certain kinds of monkeys, and in the\r\nlaughing noise made by others, during which the corners of the mouth are\r\ndrawn backwards, and the lower eyelids wrinkled. The external ears are\r\ncuriously alike. In man the nose is much more prominent than in most\r\nmonkeys; but we may trace the commencement of an aquiline curvature in\r\nthe nose of the Hoolock Gibbon; and this in the _Semnopithecus nasica_\r\nis carried to a ridiculous extreme.\r\n\r\nThe faces of many monkeys are ornamented with beards, whiskers, or\r\nmoustaches. The hair on the head grows to a great length in some species\r\nof Semnopithecus;[260] and in the Bonnet monkey (_Macacus radiatus_) it\r\nradiates from a point on the crown, with a parting down the middle, as\r\nin man. It is commonly said that the forehead gives to man his noble and\r\nintellectual appearance; but the thick hair on the head of the Bonnet\r\nmonkey terminates abruptly downwards, and is succeeded by such short and\r\nfine hair, or down, that at a little distance the forehead, with the\r\nexception of the eyebrows, appears quite naked. It has been erroneously\r\nasserted that eyebrows are not present in any monkey. In the species\r\njust named the degree of nakedness of the forehead differs in different\r\nindividuals; and Eschricht states[261] that in our children the limit\r\nbetween the hairy scalp and the naked forehead is sometimes not well\r\ndefined; so that here we seem to have a trifling case of reversion to a\r\nprogenitor, in whom the forehead had not as yet become quite naked.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the hair on our arms tends to converge from above\r\nand below to a point at the elbow. This curious arrangement, so unlike\r\nthat in most of the lower mammals, is common to the gorilla, chimpanzee,\r\norang, some species of Hylobates, and even to some few American monkeys.\r\nBut in _Hylobates agilis_ the hair on the fore-arm is directed\r\ndownwards or towards the wrist in the ordinary manner; and in _H. lar_\r\nit is nearly erect, with only a very slight forward inclination; so that\r\nin this latter species it is in a transitional state. It can hardly be\r\ndoubted that with most mammals the thickness of the hair and its\r\ndirection on the back is adapted to throw off the rain; even the\r\ntransverse hairs on the fore-legs of a dog may serve for this end when\r\nhe is coiled up asleep. Mr. Wallace remarks that the convergence of the\r\nhair towards the elbow on the arms of the orang (whose habits he has so\r\ncarefully studied) serves to throw off the rain, when, as is the custom\r\nof this animal, the arms are bent, with the hands clasped round a branch\r\nor over its own head. We should, however, bear in mind that the attitude\r\nof an animal may perhaps be in part determined by the direction of the\r\nhair; and not the direction of the hair by the attitude. If the above\r\nexplanation is correct in the case of the orang, the hair on our\r\nfore-arms offers a curious record of our former state; for no one\r\nsupposes that it is now of any use in throwing off the rain, nor in our\r\npresent erect condition is it properly directed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be rash to trust too much to the principle of\r\nadaptation in regard to the direction of the hair in man or his early\r\nprogenitors; for it is impossible to study the figures given by\r\nEschricht of the arrangement of the hair on the human foetus (this\r\nbeing the same as in the adult) and not agree with this excellent\r\nobserver that other and more complex causes have intervened. The points\r\nof convergence seem to stand in some relation to those points in the\r\nembryo which are last closed in during development. There appears, also,\r\nto exist some relation between the arrangement of the hair on the\r\nlimbs, and the course of the medullary arteries.[262]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the resemblances between man and certain\r\napes in the above and many other points--such as in having a naked\r\nforehead, long tresses on the head, &c.--are all necessarily the result\r\nof unbroken inheritance from a common progenitor thus characterised, or\r\nof subsequent reversion. Many of these resemblances are more probably\r\ndue to analogous variation, which follows, as I have elsewhere attempted\r\nto shew,[263] from co-descended organisms having a similar constitution\r\nand having been acted on by similar causes inducing variability. With\r\nrespect to the similar direction of the hair on the fore-arms of man and\r\ncertain monkeys, as this character is common to almost all the\r\nanthropomorphous apes, it may probably be attributed to inheritance; but\r\nnot certainly so, as some very distinct American monkeys are thus\r\ncharacterised. The same remark is applicable to the tailless condition\r\nof man; for the tail is absent in all the anthropomorphous apes.\r\nNevertheless this character cannot with certainty be attributed to\r\ninheritance, as the tail, though not absent, is rudimentary in several\r\nother Old World and in some New World species, and is quite absent in\r\nseveral species belonging to the allied group of Lemurs.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have now seen, man has no just right to form a separate\r\nOrder for his own reception, he may perhaps claim a distinct Sub-order\r\nor Family. Prof. Huxley, in his last work,[264] divides the Primates\r\ninto three Sub-orders; namely, the Anthropidae with man alone, the\r\nSimiadae including monkeys of all kinds, and the Lemuridae with the\r\ndiversified genera of lemurs. As far as differences in certain important\r\npoints of structure are concerned, man may no doubt rightly claim the\r\nrank of a Sub-order; and this rank is too low, if we look chiefly to his\r\nmental faculties. Nevertheless, under a genealogical point of view it\r\nappears that this rank is too high, and that man ought to form merely a\r\nFamily, or possibly even only a Sub-family. If we imagine three lines of\r\ndescent proceeding from a common source, it is quite conceivable that\r\ntwo of them might after the lapse of ages be so slightly changed as\r\nstill to remain as species of the same genus; whilst the third line\r\nmight become so greatly modified as to deserve to rank as a distinct\r\nSub-family, Family, or even Order. But in this case it is almost certain\r\nthat the third line would still retain through inheritance numerous\r\nsmall points of resemblance with the other two lines. Here then would\r\noccur the difficulty, at present insoluble, how much weight we ought to\r\nassign in our classifications to strongly-marked differences in some few\r\npoints,--that is to the amount of modification undergone; and how much\r\nto close resemblance in numerous unimportant points, as indicating the\r\nlines of descent or genealogy. The former alternative is the most\r\nobvious, and perhaps the safest, though the latter appears the most\r\ncorrect as giving a truly natural classification.\r\n\r\nTo form a judgment on this head, with reference to man we must glance at\r\nthe classification of the Simiadae. This family is divided by almost all\r\nnaturalists into the Catarhine group, or Old World monkeys, all of which\r\nare characterised (as their name expresses) by the peculiar structure of\r\ntheir nostrils and by having four premolars in each jaw; and into the\r\nPlatyrhine group or New World monkeys (including two very distinct\r\nsub-groups), all of which are characterised by differently-constructed\r\nnostrils and by having six premolars in each jaw. Some other small\r\ndifferences might be mentioned. Now man unquestionably belongs in his\r\ndentition, in the structure of his nostrils, and some other respects, to\r\nthe Catarhine or Old World division; nor does he resemble the\r\nPlatyrhines more closely than the Catarhines in any characters,\r\nexcepting in a few of not much importance and apparently of an adaptive\r\nnature. Therefore it would be against all probability to suppose that\r\nsome ancient New World species had varied, and had thus produced a\r\nman-like creature with all the distinctive characters proper to the Old\r\nWorld division; losing at the same time all its own distinctive\r\ncharacters. There can consequently hardly be a doubt that man is an\r\noffshoot from the Old World Simian stem; and that under a genealogical\r\npoint of view, he must be classed with the Catarhine division.[265]\r\n\r\nThe anthropomorphous apes, namely the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and\r\nhylobates, are separated as a distinct sub-group from the other Old\r\nWorld monkeys by most naturalists. I am aware that Gratiolet, relying on\r\nthe structure of the brain, does not admit the existence of this\r\nsub-group, and no doubt it is a broken one; thus the orang, as Mr. St.\r\nG. Mivart remarks,[266] \"is one of the most peculiar and aberrant forms\r\nto be found in the Order.\" The remaining, non-anthropomorphous, Old\r\nWorld monkeys, are again divided by some naturalists into two or three\r\nsmaller sub-groups; the genus Semnopithecus, with its peculiar\r\nsacculated stomach, being the type of one such sub-group. But it appears\r\nfrom M. Gaudry's wonderful discoveries in Attica, that during the\r\nMiocene period a form existed there, which connected Semnopithecus and\r\nMacacus; and this probably illustrates the manner in which the other and\r\nhigher groups were once blended together.\r\n\r\nIf the anthropomorphous apes be admitted to form a natural sub-group,\r\nthen as man agrees with them, not only in all those characters which he\r\npossesses in common with the whole Catarhine group, but in other\r\npeculiar characters, such as the absence of a tail and of callosities\r\nand in general appearance, we may infer that some ancient member of the\r\nanthropomorphous sub-group gave birth to man. It is not probable that a\r\nmember of one of the other lower sub-groups should, through the law of\r\nanalogous variation, have given rise to a man-like creature, resembling\r\nthe higher anthropomorphous apes in so many respects. No doubt man, in\r\ncomparison with most of his allies, has undergone an extraordinary\r\namount of modification, chiefly in consequence of his greatly developed\r\nbrain and erect position; nevertheless we should bear in mind that he\r\n\"is but one of several exceptional forms of Primates.\"[267]\r\n\r\nEvery naturalist, who believes in the principle of evolution, will\r\ngrant that the two main divisions of the Simiadae, namely the Catarhine\r\nand Platyrhine monkeys, with their sub-groups, have all proceeded from\r\nsome one extremely ancient progenitor. The early descendants of this\r\nprogenitor, before they had diverged to any considerable extent from\r\neach other, would still have formed a single natural group; but some of\r\nthe species or incipient genera would have already begun to indicate by\r\ntheir diverging characters the future distinctive marks of the Catarhine\r\nand Platyrhine divisions. Hence the members of this supposed ancient\r\ngroup would not have been so uniform in their dentition or in the\r\nstructure of their nostrils, as are the existing Catarhine monkeys in\r\none way and the Platyrhines in another way, but would have resembled in\r\nthis respect the allied Lemuridae which differ greatly from each other in\r\nthe form of their muzzles,[268] and to an extraordinary degree in their\r\ndentition.\r\n\r\nThe Catarhine and Platyrhine monkeys agree in a multitude of characters,\r\nas is shewn by their unquestionably belonging to one and the same Order.\r\nThe many characters which they possess in common can hardly have been\r\nindependently acquired by so many distinct species; so that these\r\ncharacters must have been inherited. But an ancient form which possessed\r\nmany characters common to the Catarhine and Platyrhine monkeys, and\r\nothers in an intermediate condition, and some few perhaps distinct from\r\nthose now present in either group, would undoubtedly have been ranked,\r\nif seen by a naturalist, as an ape or monkey. And as man under a\r\ngenealogical point of view belongs to the Catarhine or Old World stock,\r\nwe must conclude, however much the conclusion may revolt our pride,\r\nthat our early progenitors would have been properly thus\r\ndesignated.[269] But we must not fall into the error of supposing that\r\nthe early progenitor of the whole Simian stock, including man, was\r\nidentical with, or even closely resembled, any existing ape or monkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Birthplace and Antiquity of Man._--We are naturally led to\r\nenquire where was the birthplace of man at that stage of descent when\r\nour progenitors diverged from the Catarhine stock. The fact that they\r\nbelonged to this stock clearly shews that they inhabited the Old World;\r\nbut not Australia nor any oceanic island, as we may infer from the laws\r\nof geographical distribution. In each great region of the world the\r\nliving mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same\r\nregion. It is therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by\r\nextinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee; and as these\r\ntwo species are now man's nearest allies, it is somewhat more probable\r\nthat our early progenitors lived on the African continent than\r\nelsewhere. But it is useless to speculate on this subject, for an ape\r\nnearly as large as a man, namely the Dryopithecus of Lartet, which was\r\nclosely allied to the anthropomorphous Hylobates, existed in Europe\r\nduring the Upper Miocene period; and since so remote a period the earth\r\nhas certainly undergone many great revolutions, and there has been ample\r\ntime for migration on the largest scale.\r\n\r\nAt the period and place, whenever and wherever it may have been, when\r\nman first lost his hairy covering, he probably inhabited a hot country;\r\nand this would have been favourable for a frugiferous diet, on which,\r\njudging from analogy, he subsisted. We are far from knowing how long ago\r\nit was when man first diverged from the Catarhine stock; but this may\r\nhave occurred at an epoch as remote as the Eocene period; for the higher\r\napes had diverged from the lower apes as early as the Upper Miocene\r\nperiod, as shewn by the existence of the Dryopithecus. We are also quite\r\nignorant at how rapid a rate organisms, whether high or low in the\r\nscale, may under favourable circumstances be modified: we know, however,\r\nthat some have retained the same form during an enormous lapse of time.\r\nFrom what we see going on under domestication, we learn that within the\r\nsame period some of the co-descendants of the same species may be not at\r\nall changed, some a little, and some greatly changed. Thus it may have\r\nbeen with man, who has undergone a great amount of modification in\r\ncertain characters in comparison with the higher apes.\r\n\r\nThe great break in the organic chain between man and his nearest allies,\r\nwhich cannot be bridged over by any extinct or living species, has often\r\nbeen advanced as a grave objection to the belief that man is descended\r\nfrom some lower form; but this objection will not appear of much weight\r\nto those who, convinced by general reasons, believe in the general\r\nprinciple of evolution. Breaks incessantly occur in all parts of the\r\nseries, some being wide, sharp and defined, others less so in various\r\ndegrees; as between the orang and its nearest allies--between the\r\nTarsius and the other Lemuridae--between the elephant and in a more\r\nstriking manner between the Ornithorhynchus or Echidna, and other\r\nmammals. But all these breaks depend merely on the number of related\r\nforms which have become extinct. At some future period, not very distant\r\nas measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost\r\ncertainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races.\r\nAt the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen\r\nhas remarked,[270] will no doubt be exterminated. The break will then be\r\nrendered wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised\r\nstate, as we may hope, than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a\r\nbaboon, instead of as at present between the negro or Australian and the\r\ngorilla.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the absence of fossil remains, serving to connect man\r\nwith his ape-like progenitors, no one will lay much stress on this fact,\r\nwho will read Sir C. Lyell's discussion,[271] in which he shews that in\r\nall the vertebrate classes the discovery of fossil remains has been an\r\nextremely slow and fortuitous process. Nor should it be forgotten that\r\nthose regions which are the most likely to afford remains connecting man\r\nwith some extinct ape-like creature, have not as yet been searched by\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lower Stages in the Genealogy of Man._--We have seen that man appears\r\nto have diverged from the Catarhine or Old World division of the\r\nSimiadae, after these had diverged from the New World division. We will\r\nnow endeavour to follow the more remote traces of his genealogy,\r\ntrusting in the first place to the mutual affinities between the various\r\nclasses and orders, with some slight aid from the periods, as far as\r\nascertained, of their successive appearance on the earth. The Lemuridae\r\nstand below and close to the Simiadae, constituting a very distinct\r\nfamily of the Primates, or, according to Haeckel, a distinct Order. This\r\ngroup is diversified and broken to an extraordinary degree, and includes\r\nmany aberrant forms. It has, therefore, probably suffered much\r\nextinction. Most of the remnants survive on islands, namely in\r\nMadagascar and in the islands of the Malayan archipelago, where they\r\nhave not been exposed to such severe competition as they would have been\r\non well-stocked continents. This group likewise presents many\r\ngradations, leading, as Huxley remarks,[272] \"insensibly from the crown\r\nand summit of the animal creation down to creatures from which there is\r\nbut a step, as it seems, to the lowest, smallest, and least intelligent\r\nof the placental mammalia.\" From these various considerations it is\r\nprobable that the Simiadae were originally developed from the progenitors\r\nof the existing Lemuridae; and these in their turn from forms standing\r\nvery low in the mammalian series.\r\n\r\nThe Marsupials stand in many important characters below the placental\r\nmammals. They appeared at an earlier geological period, and their range\r\nwas formerly much more extensive than what it now is. Hence the\r\nPlacentata are generally supposed to have been derived from the\r\nImplacentata or Marsupials; not, however, from forms closely like the\r\nexisting Marsupials, but from their early progenitors. The Monotremata\r\nare plainly allied to the Marsupials; forming a third and still lower\r\ndivision in the great mammalian series. They are represented at the\r\npresent day solely by the Ornithorhynchus and Echidna; and these two\r\nforms may be safely considered as relics of a much larger group which\r\nhave been preserved in Australia through some favourable concurrence of\r\ncircumstances. The Monotremata are eminently interesting, as in several\r\nimportant points of structure they lead towards the class of reptiles.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to trace the genealogy of the Mammalia, and therefore of\r\nman, lower down in the series, we become involved in greater and greater\r\nobscurity. He who wishes to see what ingenuity and knowledge can effect,\r\nmay consult Prof. Haeckel's works.[273] I will content myself with a few\r\ngeneral remarks. Every evolutionist will admit that the five great\r\nvertebrate classes, namely, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and\r\nfishes, are all descended from some one prototype; for they have much in\r\ncommon, especially during their embryonic state. As the class of fishes\r\nis the most lowly organised and appeared before the others, we may\r\nconclude that all the members of the vertebrate kingdom are derived from\r\nsome fish-like animal, less highly organised than any as yet found in\r\nthe lowest known formations. The belief that animals so distinct as a\r\nmonkey or elephant and a humming-bird, a snake, frog, and fish, &c.,\r\ncould all have sprung from the same parents, will appear monstrous to\r\nthose who have not attended to the recent progress of natural history.\r\nFor this belief implies the former existence of links closely binding\r\ntogether all these forms, now so utterly unlike.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it is certain that groups of animals have existed, or do\r\nnow exist, which serve to connect more or less closely the several great\r\nvertebrate classes. We have seen that the Ornithorhynchus graduates\r\ntowards reptiles; and Prof. Huxley has made the remarkable discovery,\r\nconfirmed by Mr. Cope and others, that the old Dinosaurians are\r\nintermediate in many important respects between certain reptiles and\r\ncertain birds--the latter consisting of the ostrich-tribe (itself\r\nevidently a widely-diffused remnant of a larger group) and of the\r\nArcheopteryx, that strange Secondary bird having a long tail like that\r\nof the lizard. Again, according to Prof. Owen,[274] the\r\nIchthyosaurians--great sea-lizards furnished with paddles--present many\r\naffinities with fishes, or rather, according to Huxley, with amphibians.\r\nThis latter class (including in its highest division frogs and toads) is\r\nplainly allied to the Ganoid fishes. These latter fishes swarmed during\r\nthe earlier geological periods, and were constructed on what is called a\r\nhighly generalised type, that is they presented diversified affinities\r\nwith other groups of organisms. The amphibians and fishes are also so\r\nclosely united by the Lepidosiren, that naturalists long disputed in\r\nwhich of these two classes it ought to be placed. The Lepidosiren and\r\nsome few Ganoid fishes have been preserved from utter extinction by\r\ninhabiting our rivers, which are harbours of refuge, bearing the same\r\nrelation to the great waters of the ocean that islands bear to\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nLastly, one single member of the immense and diversified class of\r\nfishes, namely the lancelet or amphioxus, is so different from all other\r\nfishes, that Haeckel maintains that it ought to form a distinct class in\r\nthe vertebrate kingdom. This fish is remarkable for its negative\r\ncharacters; it can hardly be said to possess a brain, vertebral column,\r\nor heart, &c.; so that it was classed by the older naturalists amongst\r\nthe worms. Many years ago Prof. Goodsir perceived that the lancelet\r\npresented some affinities with the Ascidians, which are invertebrate,\r\nhermaphrodite, marine creatures permanently attached to a support. They\r\nhardly appear like animals, and consist of a simple, tough, leathery\r\nsack, with two small projecting orifices. They belong to the Molluscoida\r\nof Huxley--a lower division of the great kingdom of the Mollusca; but\r\nthey have recently been placed by some naturalists amongst the Vermes or\r\nworms. Their larvae somewhat resemble tadpoles in shape,[275] and have\r\nthe power of swimming freely about. Some observations lately made by M.\r\nKowalevsky,[276] since confirmed by Prof. Kuppfer, will form a discovery\r\nof extraordinary interest, if still further extended, as I hear from M.\r\nKowalevsky in Naples he has now effected. The discovery is that the\r\nlarvae of Ascidians are related to the Vertebrata, in their manner of\r\ndevelopment, in the relative position of the nervous system, and in\r\npossessing a structure closely like the _chorda dorsalis_ of vertebrate\r\nanimals. It thus appears, if we may rely on embryology, which has always\r\nproved the safest guide in classification, that we have at last gained a\r\nclue to the source whence the Vertebrata have been derived. We should\r\nthus be justified in believing that at an extremely remote period a\r\ngroup of animals existed, resembling in many respects the larvae of our\r\npresent Ascidians, which diverged into two great branches--the one\r\nretrograding in development and producing the present class of\r\nAscidians, the other rising to the crown and summit of the animal\r\nkingdom by giving birth to the Vertebrata.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have thus far endeavoured rudely to trace the genealogy of the\r\nVertebrata by the aid of their mutual affinities. We will now look to\r\nman as he exists; and we shall, I think, be able partially to restore\r\nduring successive periods, but not in due order of time, the structure\r\nof our early progenitors. This can be effected by means of the rudiments\r\nwhich man still retains, by the characters which occasionally make their\r\nappearance in him through reversion, and by the aid of the principles of\r\nmorphology and embryology. The various facts, to which I shall here\r\nallude, have been given in the previous chapters. The early progenitors\r\nof man were no doubt once covered with hair, both sexes having beards;\r\ntheir ears were pointed and capable of movement; and their bodies were\r\nprovided with a tail, having the proper muscles. Their limbs and bodies\r\nwere also acted on by many muscles which now only occasionally reappear,\r\nbut are normally present in the Quadrumana. The great artery and nerve\r\nof the humerus ran through a supra-condyloid foramen. At this or some\r\nearlier period, the intestine gave forth a much larger diverticulum or\r\ncaecum than that now existing. The foot, judging from the condition of\r\nthe great toe in the foetus, was then prehensile; and our progenitors,\r\nno doubt, were arboreal in their habits, frequenting some warm,\r\nforest-clad land. The males were provided with great canine teeth,\r\nwhich served them as formidable weapons.\r\n\r\nAt a much earlier period the uterus was double; the excreta were voided\r\nthrough a cloaca; and the eye was protected by a third eyelid or\r\nnictitating membrane. At a still earlier period the progenitors of man\r\nmust have been aquatic in their habits; for morphology plainly tells us\r\nthat our lungs consist of a modified swim-bladder, which once served as\r\na float. The clefts on the neck in the embryo of man show where the\r\nbranchiae once existed. At about this period the true kidneys were\r\nreplaced by the corpora Wolffiana. The heart existed as a simple\r\npulsating vessel; and the chorda dorsalis took the place of a vertebral\r\ncolumn. These early predecessors of man, thus seen in the dim recesses\r\nof time, must have been as lowly organised as the lancelet or amphioxus,\r\nor even still more lowly organised.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point deserving a fuller notice. It has long been\r\nknown that in the vertebrate kingdom one sex bears rudiments of various\r\naccessory parts, appertaining to the reproductive system, which properly\r\nbelong to the opposite sex; and it has now been ascertained that at a\r\nvery early embryonic period both sexes possess true male and female\r\nglands. Hence some extremely remote progenitor of the whole vertebrate\r\nkingdom appears to have been hermaphrodite or androgynous.[277] But here\r\nwe encounter a singular difficulty. In the mammalian class the males\r\npossess in their vesiculae prostaticae rudiments of a uterus with the\r\nadjacent passage; they bear also rudiments of mammae, and some male\r\nmarsupials have rudiments of a marsupial sack.[278] Other analogous\r\nfacts could be added. Are we, then, to suppose that some extremely\r\nancient mammal possessed organs proper to both sexes, that is, continued\r\nandrogynous after it had acquired the chief distinctions of its proper\r\nclass, and therefore after it had diverged from the lower classes of the\r\nvertebrate kingdom? This seems improbable in the highest degree; for had\r\nthis been the case, we might have expected that some few members of the\r\ntwo lower classes, namely fishes[279] and amphibians, would still have\r\nremained androgynous. We must, on the contrary, believe that when the\r\nfive vertebrate classes diverged from their common progenitor the sexes\r\nhad already become separated. To account, however, for male mammals\r\npossessing rudiments of the accessory female organs, and for female\r\nmammals possessing rudiments of the masculine organs, we need not\r\nsuppose that their early progenitors were still androgynous after they\r\nhad assumed their chief mammalian characters. It is quite possible that\r\nas the one sex gradually acquired the accessory organs proper to it,\r\nsome of the successive steps or modifications were transmitted to the\r\nopposite sex. When we treat of sexual selection, we shall meet with\r\ninnumerable instances of this form of transmission,--as in the case of\r\nthe spurs, plumes, and brilliant colours, acquired by male birds for\r\nbattle or ornament, and transferred to the females in an imperfect or\r\nrudimentary condition.\r\n\r\nThe possession by male mammals of functionally imperfect mammary organs\r\nis, in some respects, especially curious. The Monotremata have the\r\nproper milk-secreting glands with orifices, but no nipples; and as these\r\nanimals stand at the very base of the mammalian series, it is probable\r\nthat the progenitors of the class possessed, in like manner, the\r\nmilk-secreting glands, but no nipples. This conclusion is supported by\r\nwhat is known of their manner of development; for Professor Turner\r\ninforms me, on the authority of Koelliker and Lauger, that in the embryo\r\nthe mammary glands can be distinctly traced before the nipples are in\r\nthe least visible; and it should be borne in mind that the development\r\nof successive parts in the individual generally seems to represent and\r\naccord with the development of successive beings in the same line of\r\ndescent. The Marsupials differ from the Monotremata by possessing\r\nnipples; so that these organs were probably first acquired by the\r\nMarsupials after they had diverged from, and risen above, the\r\nMonotremata, and were then transmitted to the placental mammals. No one\r\nwill suppose that after the Marsupials had approximately acquired their\r\npresent structure, and therefore at a rather late period in the\r\ndevelopment of the mammalian series, any of its members still remained\r\nandrogynous. We seem, therefore, compelled to recur to the foregoing\r\nview, and to conclude that the nipples were first developed in the\r\nfemales of some very early marsupial form, and were then, in accordance\r\nwith a common law of inheritance, transferred in a functionally\r\nimperfect condition to the males.\r\n\r\nNevertheless a suspicion has sometimes crossed my mind that long after\r\nthe progenitors of the whole mammalian class had ceased to be\r\nandrogynous, both sexes might have yielded milk and thus nourished their\r\nyoung; and in the case of the Marsupials, that both sexes might have\r\ncarried their young in marsupial sacks. This will not appear utterly\r\nincredible, if we reflect that the males of syngnathous fishes receive\r\nthe eggs of the females in their abdominal pouches, hatch them, and\r\nafterwards, as some believe, nourish the young;[280]--that certain other\r\nmale fishes hatch the eggs within their mouths or branchial\r\ncavities;--that certain male toads take the chaplets of eggs from the\r\nfemales and wind them round their own thighs, keeping them there until\r\nthe tadpoles are born;--that certain male birds undertake the whole duty\r\nof incubation, and that male pigeons, as well as the females, feed their\r\nnestlings with a secretion from their crops. But the above suspicion\r\nfirst occurred to me from the mammary glands in male mammals being\r\ndeveloped so much more perfectly than the rudiments of those other\r\naccessory reproductive parts, which are found in the one sex though\r\nproper to the other. The mammary glands and nipples, as they exist in\r\nmale mammals, can indeed hardly be called rudimentary; they are simply\r\nnot fully developed and not functionally active. They are\r\nsympathetically affected under the influence of certain diseases, like\r\nthe same organs in the female. At birth they often secrete a few drops\r\nof milk; and they have been known occasionally in man and other mammals\r\nto become well developed, and to yield a fair supply of milk. Now if we\r\nsuppose that during a former prolonged period male mammals aided the\r\nfemales in nursing their offspring, and that afterwards from some cause,\r\nas from a smaller number of young being produced, the males ceased\r\ngiving this aid, disuse of the organs during maturity would lead to\r\ntheir becoming inactive; and from two well-known principles of\r\ninheritance this state of inactivity would probably be transmitted to\r\nthe males at the corresponding age of maturity. But at all earlier ages\r\nthese organs would be left unaffected, so that they would be equally\r\nwell developed in the young of both sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--The best definition of advancement or progress in the\r\norganic scale ever given, is that by Von Baer; and this rests on the\r\namount of differentiation and specialisation of the several parts of the\r\nsame being, when arrived, as I should be inclined to add, at maturity.\r\nNow as organisms have become slowly adapted by means of natural\r\nselection for diversified lines of life, their parts will have become,\r\nfrom the advantage gained by the division of physiological labour, more\r\nand more differentiated and specialised for various functions. The same\r\npart appears often to have been modified first for one purpose, and then\r\nlong afterwards for some other and quite distinct purpose; and thus all\r\nthe parts are rendered more and more complex. But each organism will\r\nstill retain the general type of structure of the progenitor from which\r\nit was aboriginally derived. In accordance with this view it seems, if\r\nwe turn to geological evidence, that organisation on the whole has\r\nadvanced throughout the world by slow and interrupted steps. In the\r\ngreat kingdom of the Vertebrata it has culminated in man. It must not,\r\nhowever, be supposed that groups of organic beings are always supplanted\r\nand disappear as soon as they have given birth to other and more perfect\r\ngroups. The latter, though victorious over their predecessors, may not\r\nhave become better adapted for all places in the economy of nature. Some\r\nold forms appear to have survived from inhabiting protected sites, where\r\nthey have not been exposed to very severe competition; and these often\r\naid us in constructing our genealogies, by giving us a fair idea of\r\nformer and lost populations. But we must not fall into the error of\r\nlooking at the existing members of any lowly-organised group as perfect\r\nrepresentatives of their ancient predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient progenitors in the kingdom of the Vertebrata, at which\r\nwe are able to obtain an obscure glance, apparently consisted of a group\r\nof marine animals,[281] resembling the larvae of existing Ascidians.\r\nThese animals probably gave rise to a group of fishes, as lowly\r\norganised as the lancelet; and from these the Ganoids, and other fishes\r\nlike the Lepidosiren, must have been developed. From such fish a very\r\nsmall advance would carry us on to the amphibians. We have seen that\r\nbirds and reptiles were once intimately connected together; and the\r\nMonotremata now, in a slight degree, connect mammals with reptiles. But\r\nno one can at present say by what line of descent the three higher and\r\nrelated classes, namely, mammals, birds, and reptiles, were derived from\r\neither of the two lower vertebrate classes, namely amphibians and\r\nfishes. In the class of mammals the steps are not difficult to conceive\r\nwhich led from the ancient Monotremata to the ancient Marsupials; and\r\nfrom these to the early progenitors of the placental mammals. We may\r\nthus ascend to the Lemuridae; and the interval is not wide from these to\r\nthe Simiadae. The Simiadae then branched off into two great stems, the New\r\nWorld and Old World monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote period,\r\nMan, the wonder and glory of the Universe, proceeded.\r\n\r\nThus we have given to man a pedigree of prodigious length, but not, it\r\nmay be said, of noble quality. The world, it has often been remarked,\r\nappears as if it had long been preparing for the advent of man; and\r\nthis, in one sense is strictly true, for he owes his birth to a long\r\nline of progenitors. If any single link in this chain had never existed,\r\nman would not have been exactly what he now is. Unless we wilfully close\r\nour eyes, we may, with our present knowledge, approximately recognise\r\nour parentage; nor need we feel ashamed of it. The most humble organism\r\nis something much higher than the inorganic dust under our feet; and no\r\none with an unbiassed mind can study any living creature, however\r\nhumble, without being struck with enthusiasm at its marvellous structure\r\nand properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nON THE RACES OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The nature and value of specific characters--Application to the\r\n  races of man--Arguments in favour of, and opposed to, ranking\r\n  the so-called races of man as distinct\r\n  species--Sub-species--Monogenists and polygenists--Convergence\r\n  of character--Numerous points of resemblance in body and mind\r\n  between the most distinct races of man--The state of man when\r\n  he first spread over the earth--Each race not descended from a\r\n  single pair--The extinction of races--The formation of\r\n  races--The effects of crossing--Slight influence of the direct\r\n  action of the conditions of life--Slight or no influence of\r\n  natural selection--Sexual selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention here to describe the several so-called races of\r\nmen; but to inquire what is the value of the differences between them\r\nunder a classificatory point of view, and how they have originated. In\r\ndetermining whether two or more allied forms ought to be ranked as\r\nspecies or varieties, naturalists are practically guided by the\r\nfollowing considerations; namely, the amount of difference between them,\r\nand whether such differences relate to few or many points of structure,\r\nand whether they are of physiological importance; but more especially\r\nwhether they are constant. Constancy of character is what is chiefly\r\nvalued and sought for by naturalists. Whenever it can be shewn, or\r\nrendered probable, that the forms in question have remained distinct for\r\na long period, this becomes an argument of much weight in favour of\r\ntreating them as species. Even a slight degree of sterility between any\r\ntwo forms when first crossed, or in their offspring, is generally\r\nconsidered as a decisive test of their specific distinctness; and their\r\ncontinued persistence without blending within the same area, is usually\r\naccepted as sufficient evidence, either of some degree of mutual\r\nsterility, or in the case of animals of some repugnance to mutual\r\npairing.\r\n\r\nIndependently of blending from intercrossing, the complete absence, in a\r\nwell-investigated region, of varieties linking together any two\r\nclosely-allied forms, is probably the most important of all the\r\ncriterions of their specific distinctness; and this is a somewhat\r\ndifferent consideration from mere constancy of character, for two forms\r\nmay be highly variable and yet not yield intermediate varieties.\r\nGeographical distribution is often unconsciously and sometimes\r\nconsciously brought into play; so that forms living in two widely\r\nseparated areas, in which most of the other inhabitants are specifically\r\ndistinct, are themselves usually looked at as distinct; but in truth\r\nthis affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races from so-called\r\ngood or true species.\r\n\r\nNow let us apply these generally-admitted principles to the races of\r\nman, viewing him in the same spirit as a naturalist would any other\r\nanimal. In regard to the amount of difference between the races, we must\r\nmake some allowance for our nice powers of discrimination gained by the\r\nlong habit of observing ourselves. In India, as Elphinstone\r\nremarks,[282] although a newly-arrived European cannot at first\r\ndistinguish the various native races, yet they soon appear to him\r\nextremely dissimilar; and the Hindoo cannot at first perceive any\r\ndifference between the several European nations. Even the most distinct\r\nraces of man, with the exception of certain negro tribes, are much more\r\nlike each other in form than would at first be supposed. This is well\r\nshewn by the French photographs in the Collection Anthropologique du\r\nMuseum of the men belonging to various races, the greater number of\r\nwhich, as many persons to whom I have shown them have remarked, might\r\npass for Europeans. Nevertheless, these men if seen alive would\r\nundoubtedly appear very distinct, so that we are clearly much influenced\r\nin our judgment by the mere colour of the skin and hair, by slight\r\ndifferences in the features, and by expression.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no doubt that the various races, when carefully\r\ncompared and measured, differ much from each other,--as in the texture\r\nof the hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body,[283] the\r\ncapacity of the lungs, the form and capacity of the skull, and even in\r\nthe convolutions of the brain.[284] But it would be an endless task to\r\nspecify the numerous points of structural difference. The races differ\r\nalso in constitution, in acclimatisation, and in liability to certain\r\ndiseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct;\r\nchiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their\r\nintellectual, faculties. Every one who has had the opportunity of\r\ncomparison, must have been struck with the contrast between the\r\ntaciturn, even morose, aborigines of S. America and the light-hearted,\r\ntalkative negroes. There is a nearly similar contrast between the Malays\r\nand the Papuans,[285] who live under the same physical conditions, and\r\nare separated from each other only by a narrow space of sea.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider the arguments which may be advanced in favour of\r\nclassing the races of man as distinct species, and then those on the\r\nother side. If a naturalist, who had never before seen such beings, were\r\nto compare a Negro, Hottentot, Australian, or Mongolian, he would at\r\nonce perceive that they differed in a multitude of characters, some of\r\nslight and some of considerable importance. On inquiry he would find\r\nthat they were adapted to live under widely different climates, and that\r\nthey differed somewhat in bodily constitution and mental disposition. If\r\nhe were then told that hundreds of similar specimens could be brought\r\nfrom the same countries, he would assuredly declare that they were as\r\ngood species as many to which he had been in the habit of affixing\r\nspecific names. This conclusion would be greatly strengthened as soon as\r\nhe had ascertained that these forms had all retained the same character\r\nfor many centuries; and that negroes, apparently identical with existing\r\nnegroes, had lived at least 4000 years ago.[286] He would also hear from\r\nan excellent observer, Dr. Lund,[287] that the human skulls found in\r\nthe caves of Brazil, entombed with many extinct mammals, belonged to the\r\nsame type as that now prevailing throughout the American Continent.\r\n\r\nOur naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution, and\r\nhe would probably declare that forms differing not only in appearance,\r\nbut fitted for the hottest and dampest or driest countries, as well as\r\nfor the arctic regions, must be distinct species. He might appeal to the\r\nfact that no one species in the group next to man, namely the\r\nQuadrumana, can resist a low temperature or any considerable change of\r\nclimate; and that those species which come nearest to man have never\r\nbeen reared to maturity, even under the temperate climate of Europe. He\r\nwould be deeply impressed with the fact, first noticed by Agassiz,[288]\r\nthat the different races of man are distributed over the world in the\r\nsame zoological provinces, as those inhabited by undoubtedly distinct\r\nspecies and genera of mammals. This is manifestly the case with the\r\nAustralian, Mongolian, and Negro races of man; in a less well-marked\r\nmanner with the Hottentots; but plainly with the Papuans and Malays, who\r\nare separated, as Mr. Wallace has shewn, by nearly the same line which\r\ndivides the great Malayan and Australian zoological provinces. The\r\naborigines of America range throughout the Continent; and this at first\r\nappears opposed to the above rule, for most of the productions of the\r\nSouthern and Northern halves differ widely; yet some few living forms,\r\nas the opossum, range from the one into the other, as did formerly some\r\nof the gigantic Edentata. The Esquimaux, like other Arctic animals,\r\nextend round the whole polar regions. It should be observed that the\r\nmammalian forms which inhabit the several zoological provinces, do not\r\ndiffer from each other in the same degree; so that it can hardly be\r\nconsidered as an anomaly that the Negro differs more, and the American\r\nmuch less, from the other races of man than do the mammals of the same\r\ncontinents from those of the other provinces. Man, it may be added, does\r\nnot appear to have aboriginally inhabited any oceanic island; and in\r\nthis respect he resembles the other members of his class.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether the varieties of the same kind of domestic animal\r\nshould be ranked as specifically distinct, that is, whether any of them\r\nare descended from distinct wild species, every naturalist would lay\r\nmuch stress on the fact, if established, of their external parasites\r\nbeing specifically distinct. All the more stress would be laid on this\r\nfact, as it would be an exceptional one, for I am informed by Mr. Denny\r\nthat the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons, in England,\r\nare infested by the same species of Pediculi or lice. Now Mr. A. Murray\r\nhas carefully examined the Pediculi collected in different countries\r\nfrom the different races of man;[289] and he finds that they differ, not\r\nonly in colour, but in the structure of their claws and limbs. In every\r\ncase in which numerous specimens were obtained the differences were\r\nconstant. The surgeon of a whaling ship in the Pacific assured me that\r\nwhen the Pediculi, with which some Sandwich Islanders on board swarmed,\r\nstrayed on to the bodies of the English sailors, they died in the course\r\nof three or four days. These Pediculi were darker coloured and appeared\r\ndifferent from those proper to the natives of Chiloe in South America,\r\nof which he gave me specimens. These, again, appeared larger and much\r\nsofter than European lice. Mr. Murray procured four kinds from Africa,\r\nnamely from the Negroes of the Eastern and Western coasts, from the\r\nHottentots and Caffres; two kinds from the natives of Australia; two\r\nfrom North, and two from South America. In these latter cases it may be\r\npresumed that the Pediculi came from natives inhabiting different\r\ndistricts. With insects slight structural differences, if constant, are\r\ngenerally esteemed of specific value: and the fact of the races of man\r\nbeing infested by parasites, which appear to be specifically distinct,\r\nmight fairly be urged as an argument that the races themselves ought to\r\nbe classed as distinct species.\r\n\r\nOur supposed naturalist having proceeded thus far in his investigation,\r\nwould next inquire whether the races of men, when crossed, were in any\r\ndegree sterile. He might consult the work[290] of a cautious and\r\nphilosophical observer, Professor Broca; and in this he would find good,\r\nevidence that some races were quite fertile together; but evidence of an\r\nopposite nature in regard to other races. Thus it has been asserted that\r\nthe native women of Australia and Tasmania rarely produce children to\r\nEuropean men; the evidence, however, on this head has now been shewn to\r\nbe almost valueless. The half-castes are killed by the pure blacks; and\r\nan account has lately been published of eleven half-caste youths\r\nmurdered and burnt at the same time, whose remains were found by the\r\npolice.[291] Again, it has often been said that when mulattoes\r\nintermarry they produce few children; on the other hand, Dr. Bachman of\r\nCharlestown[292] positively asserts that he has known mulatto families\r\nwhich have intermarried for several generations, and have continued on\r\nan average as fertile as either pure whites or pure blacks. Inquiries\r\nformerly made by Sir C. Lyell on this subject led him, as he informs me,\r\nto the same conclusion. In the United States the census for the year\r\n1854 included, according to Dr. Bachman, 405,751 mulattoes; and this\r\nnumber, considering all the circumstances of the case, seems small; but\r\nit may partly be accounted for by the degraded and anomalous position of\r\nthe class, and by the profligacy of the women. A certain amount of\r\nabsorption of mulattoes into negroes must always be in progress; and\r\nthis would lead to an apparent diminution of the former. The inferior\r\nvitality of mulattoes is spoken of in a trustworthy work[293] as a\r\nwell-known phenomenon; but this is a different consideration from their\r\nlessened fertility; and can hardly be advanced as a proof of the\r\nspecific distinctness of the parent races. No doubt both animal and\r\nvegetable hybrids, when produced from extremely distinct species, are\r\nliable to premature death; but the parents of mulattoes cannot be put\r\nunder the category of extremely distinct species. The common Mule, so\r\nnotorious for long life and vigour, and yet so sterile, shews how little\r\nnecessary connection there is in hybrids between lessened fertility and\r\nvitality: other analogous cases could be added.\r\n\r\nEven if it should hereafter be proved that all the races of men were\r\nperfectly fertile together, he who was inclined from other reasons to\r\nrank them as distinct species, might with justice argue that fertility\r\nand sterility are not safe criterions of specific distinctness. We know\r\nthat these qualities are easily affected by changed conditions of life\r\nor by close inter-breeding, and that they are governed by highly complex\r\nlaws, for instance that of the unequal fertility of reciprocal crosses\r\nbetween the same two species. With forms which must be ranked as\r\nundoubted species, a perfect series exists from those which are\r\nabsolutely sterile when crossed, to those which are almost or quite\r\nfertile. The degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly with the\r\ndegrees of difference in external structure or habits of life. Man in\r\nmany respects may be compared with those animals which have long been\r\ndomesticated, and a large body of evidence can be advanced in favour of\r\nthe Pallasian doctrine[294] that domestication tends to eliminate the\r\nsterility which is so general a result of the crossing of species in a\r\nstate of nature. From these several considerations, it may be justly\r\nurged that the perfect fertility of the intercrossed races of man, if\r\nestablished, would not absolutely preclude us from ranking them as\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nIndependently of fertility, the character of the offspring from a cross\r\nhas sometimes been thought to afford evidence whether the parent-forms\r\nought to be ranked as species or varieties; but after carefully studying\r\nthe evidence, I have come to the conclusion that no general rules of\r\nthis kind can be trusted. Thus with mankind the offspring of distinct\r\nraces resemble in all respects the offspring of true species and of\r\nvarieties. This is shewn, for instance, by the manner in which the\r\ncharacters of both parents are blended, and by one form absorbing\r\nanother through repeated crosses. In this latter case the progeny both\r\nof crossed species and varieties retain for a long period a tendency to\r\nrevert to their ancestors, especially to that one which is prepotent in\r\ntransmission. When any character has suddenly appeared in a race or\r\nspecies as the result of a single act of variation, as is general with\r\nmonstrosities,[295] and this race is crossed with another not thus\r\ncharacterised, the characters in question do not commonly appear in a\r\nblended condition in the young, but are transmitted to them either\r\nperfectly developed or not at all. As with the crossed races of man\r\ncases of this kind rarely or never occur, this may be used as an\r\nargument against the view suggested by some ethnologists, namely that\r\ncertain characters, for instance the blackness of the negro, first\r\nappeared as a sudden variation or sport. Had this occurred, it is\r\nprobable that mulattoes would often have been born, either completely\r\nblack or completely white.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that a naturalist might feel himself fully justified in\r\nranking the races of man as distinct species; for he has found that they\r\nare distinguished by many differences in structure and constitution,\r\nsome being of importance. These differences have, also, remained nearly\r\nconstant for very long periods of time. He will have been in some degree\r\ninfluenced by the enormous range of man, which is a great anomaly in the\r\nclass of mammals, if mankind be viewed as a single species. He will have\r\nbeen struck with the distribution of the several so-called races, in\r\naccordance with that of other undoubtedly distinct species of mammals.\r\nFinally he might urge that the mutual fertility of all the races has not\r\nas yet been fully proved; and even if proved would not be an absolute\r\nproof of their specific identity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the question, if our supposed naturalist were to\r\nenquire whether the forms of man kept distinct like ordinary species,\r\nwhen mingled together in large numbers in the same country, he would\r\nimmediately discover that this was by no means the case. In Brazil he\r\nwould behold an immense mongrel population of Negroes and Portuguese; in\r\nChiloe and other parts of South America, he would behold the whole\r\npopulation consisting of Indians and Spaniards blended in various\r\ndegrees.[296] In many parts of the same continent he would meet with the\r\nmost complex crosses between Negroes, Indians, and Europeans; and such\r\ntriple crosses afford the severest test, judging from the vegetable\r\nkingdom, of the mutual fertility of the parent-forms. In one island of\r\nthe Pacific he would find a small population of mingled Polynesian and\r\nEnglish blood; and in the Viti Archipelago a population of Polynesians\r\nand Negritos crossed in all degrees. Many analogous cases could be\r\nadded, for instance, in South Africa. Hence the races of man are not\r\nsufficiently distinct to co-exist without fusion; and this it is, which\r\nin all ordinary cases affords the usual test of specific distinctness.\r\n\r\nOur naturalist would likewise be much disturbed as soon as he perceived\r\nthat the distinctive characters of every race of man were highly\r\nvariable. This strikes every one when he first beholds the negro-slaves\r\nin Brazil, who have been imported from all parts of Africa. The same\r\nremark holds good with the Polynesians, and with many other races. It\r\nmay be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive\r\nof a race and is constant. Savages, even within the limits of the same\r\ntribe, are not nearly so uniform in character, as has often been said.\r\nHottentot women offer certain peculiarities, more strongly marked than\r\nthose occurring in any other race, but these are known not to be of\r\nconstant occurrence. In the several American tribes, colour and\r\nhairyness differ considerably; as does colour to a certain degree, and\r\nthe shape of the features greatly, in the Negroes of Africa. The shape\r\nof the skull varies much in some races;[297] and so it is with every\r\nother character. Now all naturalists have learnt by dearly-bought\r\nexperience, how rash it is to attempt to define species by the aid of\r\ninconstant characters.\r\n\r\nBut the most weighty of all the arguments against treating the races of\r\nman as distinct species, is that they graduate into each other,\r\nindependently in many cases, as far as we can judge, of their having\r\nintercrossed. Man has been studied more carefully than any other organic\r\nbeing, and yet there is the greatest possible diversity amongst capable\r\njudges whether he should be classed as a single species or race, or as\r\ntwo (Virey), as three (Jacquinot), as four (Kant), five (Blumenbach),\r\nsix (Buffon), seven (Hunter), eight (Agassiz), eleven (Pickering),\r\nfifteen (Bory St. Vincent), sixteen (Desmoulins), twenty-two (Morton),\r\nsixty (Crawfurd), or as sixty-three, according to Burke.[298] This\r\ndiversity of judgment does not prove that the races ought not to be\r\nranked as species, but it shews that they graduate into each other, and\r\nthat it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nEvery naturalist who has had the misfortune to undertake the\r\ndescription of a group of highly varying organisms, has encountered\r\ncases (I speak after experience) precisely like that of man; and if of a\r\ncautious disposition, he will end by uniting all the forms which\r\ngraduate into each other as a single species; for he will say to himself\r\nthat he has no right to give names to objects which he cannot define.\r\nCases of this kind occur in the Order which includes man, namely in\r\ncertain genera of monkeys; whilst in other genera, as in Cercopithecus,\r\nmost of the species can be determined with certainty. In the American\r\ngenus Cebus, the various forms are ranked by some naturalists as\r\nspecies, by others as mere geographical races. Now if numerous specimens\r\nof Cebus were collected from all parts of South America, and those forms\r\nwhich at present appear to be specifically distinct, were found to\r\ngraduate into each other by close steps, they would be ranked by most\r\nnaturalists as mere varieties or races; and thus the greater number of\r\nnaturalists have acted with respect to the races of man. Nevertheless it\r\nmust be confessed that there are forms, at least in the vegetable\r\nkingdom,[299] which we cannot avoid naming as species, but which are\r\nconnected together, independently of intercrossing, by numberless\r\ngradations.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists have lately employed the term \"sub-species\" to\r\ndesignate forms which possess many of the characteristics of true\r\nspecies, but which hardly deserve so high a rank. Now if we reflect on\r\nthe weighty arguments, above given, for raising the races of man to the\r\ndignity of species, and the insuperable difficulties on the other side\r\nin defining them, the term \"sub-species\" might here be used with much\r\npropriety. But from long habit the term \"race\" will perhaps always be\r\nemployed. The choice of terms is only so far important as it is highly\r\ndesirable to use, as far as that may be possible, the same terms for the\r\nsame degrees of difference. Unfortunately this is rarely possible; for\r\nwithin the same family the larger genera generally include\r\nclosely-allied forms, which can be distinguished only with much\r\ndifficulty, whilst the smaller genera include forms that are perfectly\r\ndistinct; yet all must equally be ranked as species. So again the\r\nspecies within the same large genus by no means resemble each other to\r\nthe same degree: on the contrary, in most cases some of them can be\r\narranged in little groups round other species, like satellites round\r\nplanets.[300]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of\r\nlate years been much agitated by anthropologists, who are divided into\r\ntwo schools of monogenists and polygenists. Those who do not admit the\r\nprinciple of evolution, must look at species either as separate\r\ncreations or as in some manner distinct entities; and they must decide\r\nwhat forms to rank as species by the analogy of other organic beings\r\nwhich are commonly thus received. But it is a hopeless endeavour to\r\ndecide this point on sound grounds, until some definition of the term\r\n\"species\" is generally accepted; and the definition must not include an\r\nelement which cannot possibly be ascertained, such as an act of\r\ncreation. We might as well attempt without any definition to decide\r\nwhether a certain number of houses should be called a village, or town,\r\nor city. We have a practical illustration of the difficulty in the\r\nnever-ending doubts whether many closely-allied mammals, birds,\r\ninsects, and plants, which represent each other in North America and\r\nEurope, should be ranked species or geographical races; and so it is\r\nwith the productions of many islands situated at some little distance\r\nfrom the nearest continent.\r\n\r\nThose naturalists, on the other hand, who admit the principle of\r\nevolution, and this is now admitted by the greater number of rising men,\r\nwill feel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single\r\nprimitive stock; whether or not they think fit to designate them as\r\ndistinct species, for the sake of expressing their amount of\r\ndifference.[301] With our domestic animals the question whether the\r\nvarious races have arisen from one or more species is different.\r\nAlthough all such races, as well as all the natural species within the\r\nsame genus, have undoubtedly sprung from the same primitive stock, yet\r\nit is a fit subject for discussion, whether, for instance, all the\r\ndomestic races of the dog have acquired their present differences since\r\nsome one species was first domesticated and bred by man; or whether they\r\nowe some of their characters to inheritance from distinct species, which\r\nhad already been modified in a state of nature. With mankind no such\r\nquestion can arise, for he cannot be said to have been domesticated at\r\nany particular period.\r\n\r\nWhen the races of man diverged at an extremely remote epoch from their\r\ncommon progenitor, they will have differed but little from each other,\r\nand been few in number; consequently they will then, as far as their\r\ndistinguishing characters are concerned, have had less claim to rank as\r\ndistinct species, than the existing so-called races. Nevertheless such\r\nearly races would perhaps have been ranked by some naturalists as\r\ndistinct species, so arbitrary is the term, if their differences,\r\nalthough extremely slight, had been more constant than at present, and\r\nhad not graduated into each other.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, possible, though far from probable, that the early\r\nprogenitors of man might at first have diverged much in character, until\r\nthey became more unlike each other than are any existing races; but that\r\nsubsequently, as suggested by Vogt,[302] they converged in character.\r\nWhen man selects for the same object the offspring of two distinct\r\nspecies, he sometimes induces, as far as general appearance is\r\nconcerned, a considerable amount of convergence. This is the case, as\r\nshewn by Von Nathusius,[303] with the improved breeds of pigs, which are\r\ndescended from two distinct species; and in a less well-marked manner\r\nwith the improved breeds of cattle. A great anatomist, Gratiolet,\r\nmaintains that the anthropomorphous apes do not form a natural\r\nsub-group; but that the orang is a highly developed gibbon or\r\nsemnopithecus; the chimpanzee a highly developed macacus; and the\r\ngorilla a highly developed mandrill. If this conclusion, which rests\r\nalmost exclusively on brain-characters, be admitted, we should have a\r\ncase of convergence at least in external characters, for the\r\nanthropomorphous apes are certainly more like each other in many points\r\nthan they are to other apes. All analogical resemblances, as of a whale\r\nto a fish, may indeed be said to be cases of convergence; but this term\r\nhas never been applied to superficial and adaptive resemblances. It\r\nwould be extremely rash in most cases to attribute to convergence close\r\nsimilarity in many points of structure in beings which had once been\r\nwidely different. The form of a crystal is determined solely by the\r\nmolecular forces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances\r\nshould sometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should\r\nbear in mind that the form of each depends on an infinitude of complex\r\nrelations, namely on the variations which have arisen, these being due\r\nto causes far too intricate to be followed out,--on the nature of the\r\nvariations which have been preserved, and this depends on the\r\nsurrounding physical conditions, and in a still higher degree on the\r\nsurrounding organisms with which each has come into competition,--and\r\nlastly, on inheritance (in itself a fluctuating element) from\r\ninnumerable progenitors, all of which have had their forms determined\r\nthrough equally complex relations. It appears utterly incredible that\r\ntwo organisms, if differing in a marked manner, should ever afterwards\r\nconverge so closely as to lead to a near approach to identity throughout\r\ntheir whole organisation. In the case of the convergent pigs above\r\nreferred to, evidence of their descent from two primitive stocks is\r\nstill plainly retained, according to Von Nathusius, in certain bones of\r\ntheir skulls. If the races of man were descended, as supposed by some\r\nnaturalists, from two or more distinct species, which had differed as\r\nmuch, or nearly as much, from each other, as the orang differs from the\r\ngorilla, it can hardly be doubted that marked differences in the\r\nstructure of certain bones would still have been discoverable in man as\r\nhe now exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the existing races of man differ in many respects, as in\r\ncolour, hair, shape of skull, proportions of the body, &c., yet if their\r\nwhole organisation be taken into consideration they are found to\r\nresemble each other closely in a multitude of points. Many of these\r\npoints are of so unimportant or of so singular a nature, that it is\r\nextremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired\r\nby aboriginally distinct species or races. The same remark holds good\r\nwith equal or greater force with respect to the numerous points of\r\nmental similarity between the most distinct races of man. The American\r\naborigines, Negroes and Europeans differ as much from each other in mind\r\nas any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly struck,\r\nwhilst living with the Fuegians on board the \"Beagle,\" with the many\r\nlittle traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to\r\nours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I happened once\r\nto be intimate.\r\n\r\nHe who will carefully read Mr. Tylor's and Sir J. Lubbock's interesting\r\nworks[304] can hardly fail to be deeply impressed with the close\r\nsimilarity between the men of all races in tastes, dispositions and\r\nhabits. This is shewn by the pleasure which they all take in dancing,\r\nrude music, acting, painting, tattooing, and otherwise decorating\r\nthemselves,--in their mutual comprehension of gesture-language--and, as\r\nI shall be able to shew in a future essay, by the same expression in\r\ntheir features, and by the same inarticulate cries, when they are\r\nexcited by various emotions. This similarity, or rather identity, is\r\nstriking, when contrasted with the different expressions which may be\r\nobserved in distinct species of monkeys. There is good evidence that the\r\nart of shooting with bows and arrows has not been handed down from any\r\ncommon progenitor of mankind, yet the stone arrow-heads, brought from\r\nthe most distant parts of the world and manufactured at the most remote\r\nperiods, are, as Nilsson has shewn,[305] almost identical; and this fact\r\ncan only be accounted for by the various races having similar inventive\r\nor mental powers. The same observation has been made by\r\narchaeologists[306] with respect to certain widely-prevalent ornaments,\r\nsuch as zigzags, &c.; and with respect to various simple beliefs and\r\ncustoms, such as the burying of the dead under megalithic structures. I\r\nremember observing in South America,[307] that there, as in so many\r\nother parts of the world, man has generally chosen the summits of lofty\r\nhills, on which to throw up piles of stones, either for the sake of\r\nrecording some remarkable event, or for burying his dead.\r\n\r\nNow when naturalists observe a close agreement in numerous small details\r\nof habits, tastes and dispositions between two or more domestic races,\r\nor between nearly-allied natural forms, they use this fact as an\r\nargument that all are descended from a common progenitor who was thus\r\nendowed; and consequently that all should be classed under the same\r\nspecies. The same argument may be applied with much force to the races\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nAs it is improbable that the numerous and unimportant points of\r\nresemblance between the several races of man in bodily structure and\r\nmental faculties (I do not here refer to similar customs) should all\r\nhave been independently acquired, they must have been inherited from\r\nprogenitors who were thus characterised. We thus gain some insight into\r\nthe early state of man, before he had spread step by step over the face\r\nof the earth. The spreading of man to regions widely separated by the\r\nsea, no doubt, preceded any considerable amount of divergence of\r\ncharacter in the several races; for otherwise we should sometimes meet\r\nwith the same race in distinct continents; and this is never the case.\r\nSir J. Lubbock, after comparing the arts now practised by savages in all\r\nparts of the world, specifies those which man could not have known, when\r\nhe first wandered from his original birthplace; for if once learnt they\r\nwould never have been forgotten.[308] He thus shews that \"the spear,\r\nwhich is but a development of the knife-point, and the club, which is\r\nbut a long hammer, are the only things left.\" He admits, however, that\r\nthe art of making fire probably had already been discovered, for it is\r\ncommon to all the races now existing, and was known to the ancient\r\ncave-inhabitants of Europe. Perhaps the art of making rude canoes or\r\nrafts was likewise known; but as man existed at a remote epoch, when the\r\nland in many places stood at a very different level, he would have been\r\nable, without the aid of canoes, to have spread widely. Sir J. Lubbock\r\nfurther remarks how improbable it is that our earliest ancestors could\r\nhave \"counted as high as ten, considering that so many races now in\r\nexistence cannot get beyond four.\" Nevertheless, at this early period,\r\nthe intellectual and social faculties of man could hardly have been\r\ninferior in any extreme degree to those now possessed by the lowest\r\nsavages; otherwise primeval man could not have been so eminently\r\nsuccessful in the struggle for life, as proved by his early and wide\r\ndiffusion.\r\n\r\nFrom the fundamental differences between certain languages, some\r\nphilologists have inferred that when man first became widely diffused he\r\nwas not a speaking animal; but it may be suspected that languages, far\r\nless perfect than any now spoken, aided by gestures, might have been\r\nused, and yet have left no traces on subsequent and more\r\nhighly-developed tongues. Without the use of some language, however\r\nimperfect, it appears doubtful whether man's intellect could have risen\r\nto the standard implied by his dominant position at an early period.\r\n\r\nWhether primeval man, when he possessed very few arts of the rudest\r\nkind, and when his power of language was extremely imperfect, would have\r\ndeserved to be called man, must depend on the definition which we\r\nemploy. In a series of forms graduating insensibly from some ape-like\r\ncreature to man as he now exists, it would be impossible to fix on any\r\ndefinite point when the term \"man\" ought to be used. But this is a\r\nmatter of very little importance. So again it is almost a matter of\r\nindifference whether the so-called races of man are thus designated, or\r\nare ranked as species or sub-species; but the latter term appears the\r\nmost appropriate. Finally, we may conclude that when the principles of\r\nevolution are generally accepted, as they surely will be before long,\r\nthe dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a\r\nsilent and unobserved death.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other question ought not to be passed over without notice, namely,\r\nwhether, as is sometimes assumed, each sub-species or race of man has\r\nsprung from a single pair of progenitors. With our domestic animals a\r\nnew race can readily be formed from a single pair possessing some new\r\ncharacter, or even from a single individual thus characterised, by\r\ncarefully matching the varying offspring; but most of our races have\r\nbeen formed, not intentionally from a selected pair, but unconsciously\r\nby the preservation of many individuals which have varied, however\r\nslightly, in some useful or desired manner. If in one country stronger\r\nand heavier horses, and in another country lighter and fleeter horses,\r\nwere habitually preferred, we may feel sure that two distinct sub-breeds\r\nwould, in the course of time, be produced, without any particular pairs\r\nor individuals having been separated and bred from in either country.\r\nMany races have been thus formed, and their manner of formation is\r\nclosely analogous with that of natural species. We know, also, that the\r\nhorses which have been brought to the Falkland Islands have become,\r\nduring successive generations, smaller and weaker, whilst those which\r\nhave run wild on the Pampas have acquired larger and coarser heads; and\r\nsuch changes are manifestly due, not to any one pair, but to all the\r\nindividuals having been subjected to the same conditions, aided,\r\nperhaps, by the principle of reversion. The new sub-breeds in none of\r\nthese cases are descended from any single pair, but from many\r\nindividuals which have varied in different degrees, but in the same\r\ngeneral manner; and we may conclude that the races of man have been\r\nsimilarly produced, the modifications being either the direct result of\r\nexposure to different conditions, or the indirect result of some form of\r\nselection. But to this latter subject we shall presently return.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Extinction of the Races of Man._--The partial and complete\r\nextinction of many races and sub-races of man are historically known\r\nevents. Humboldt saw in South America a parrot which was the sole living\r\ncreature that could speak the language of a lost tribe. Ancient\r\nmonuments and stone implements found in all parts of the world, of which\r\nno tradition is preserved by the present inhabitants, indicate much\r\nextinction. Some small and broken tribes, remnants of former races,\r\nstill survive in isolated and generally mountainous districts. In Europe\r\nthe ancient races were all, according to Schaaffhausen,[309] \"lower in\r\nthe scale than the rudest living savages;\" they must therefore have\r\ndiffered, to a certain extent, from any existing race. The remains\r\ndescribed by Professor Broca[310] from Les Eyzies, though they\r\nunfortunately appear to have belonged to a single family, indicate a\r\nrace with a most singular combination of low or simious and high\r\ncharacteristics, and is \"entirely different from any other race, ancient\r\nor modern, that we have ever heard of.\" It differed, therefore, from the\r\nquaternary race of the caverns of Belgium.\r\n\r\nUnfavourable physical conditions appear to have had but little effect in\r\nthe extinction of races.[311] Man has long lived in the extreme regions\r\nof the North, with no wood wherewith to make his canoes or other\r\nimplements, and with blubber alone for burning and giving him warmth,\r\nbut more especially for melting the snow. In the Southern extremity of\r\nAmerica the Fuegians survive without the protection of clothes, or of\r\nany building worthy to be called a hovel. In South Africa the aborigines\r\nwander over the most arid plains, where dangerous beasts abound. Man can\r\nwithstand the deadly influence of the Terai at the foot of the Himalaya,\r\nand the pestilential shores of tropical Africa.\r\n\r\nExtinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe,\r\nand race with race. Various checks are always in action, as specified in\r\na former chapter, which serve to keep down the numbers of each savage\r\ntribe,--such as periodical famines, the wandering of the parents and the\r\nconsequent deaths of infants, prolonged suckling, the stealing of women,\r\nwars, accidents, sickness, licentiousness, especially infanticide, and,\r\nperhaps, lessened fertility from less nutritious food, and many\r\nhardships. If from any cause any one of these checks is lessened, even\r\nin a slight degree, the tribe thus favoured will tend to increase; and\r\nwhen one of two adjoining tribes becomes more numerous and powerful than\r\nthe other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism,\r\nslavery, and absorption. Even when a weaker tribe is not thus abruptly\r\nswept away, if it once begins to decrease, it generally goes on\r\ndecreasing until it is extinct.[312]\r\n\r\nWhen civilised nations come into contact with barbarians the struggle is\r\nshort, except where a deadly climate gives its aid to the native race.\r\nOf the causes which lead to the victory of civilised nations, some are\r\nplain and some very obscure. We can see that the cultivation of the land\r\nwill be fatal in many ways to savages, for they cannot, or will not,\r\nchange their habits. New diseases and vices are highly destructive; and\r\nit appears that in every nation a new disease causes much death, until\r\nthose who are most susceptible to its destructive influence are\r\ngradually weeded out;[313] and so it may be with the evil effects from\r\nspirituous liquors, as well as with the unconquerably strong taste for\r\nthem shewn by so many savages. It further appears, mysterious as is the\r\nfact, that the first meeting of distinct and separated people generates\r\ndisease.[314] Mr. Sproat, who in Vancouver Island closely attended to\r\nthe subject of extinction, believes that changed habits of life, which\r\nalways follow from the advent of Europeans, induces much ill-health. He\r\nlays, also, great stress on so trifling a cause as that the natives\r\nbecome \"bewildered and dull by the new life around them; they lose the\r\nmotives for exertion, and get no new ones in their place.\"[315]\r\n\r\nThe grade of civilisation seems a most important element in the success\r\nof nations which come in competition. A few centuries ago Europe feared\r\nthe inroads of Eastern barbarians; now, any such fear would be\r\nridiculous. It is a more curious fact, that savages did not formerly\r\nwaste away, as Mr. Bagehot has remarked, before the classical nations,\r\nas they now do before modern civilised nations; had they done so, the\r\nold moralists would have mused over the event; but there is no lament in\r\nany writer of that period over the perishing barbarians.[316]\r\n\r\nAlthough the gradual decrease and final extinction of the races of man\r\nis an obscure problem, we can see that it depends on many causes,\r\ndiffering in different places and at different times. It is the same\r\ndifficult problem as that presented by the extinction of one of the\r\nhigher animals--of the fossil horse, for instance, which disappeared\r\nfrom South America, soon afterwards to be replaced, within the same\r\ndistricts, by countless troops of the Spanish horse. The New Zealander\r\nseems conscious of this parallelism, for he compares his future fate\r\nwith that of the native rat almost exterminated by the European rat. The\r\ndifficulty, though great to our imagination, and really great if we wish\r\nto ascertain the precise causes, ought not to be so to our reason, as\r\nlong as we keep steadily in mind that the increase of each species and\r\neach race is constantly hindered by various checks; so that if any new\r\ncheck, or cause of destruction, even a slight one, be superadded, the\r\nrace will surely decrease in number; and as it has everywhere been\r\nobserved that savages are much opposed to any change of habits, by which\r\nmeans injurious checks could be counterbalanced, decreasing numbers will\r\nsooner or later lead to extinction; the end, in most cases, being\r\npromptly determined by the inroads of increasing and conquering tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Formation of the Races of Man._--It may be premised that when we\r\nfind the same race, though broken up into distinct tribes, ranging over\r\na great area, as over America, we may attribute their general\r\nresemblance to descent from a common stock. In some cases the crossing\r\nof races already, distinct has led to the formation of new races. The\r\nsingular fact that Europeans and Hindoos, who belong to the same Aryan\r\nstock and speak a language fundamentally the same, differ widely in\r\nappearance, whilst Europeans differ but little from Jews, who belong to\r\nthe Semitic stock and speak quite another language, has been accounted\r\nfor by Broca[317] through the Aryan branches having been largely crossed\r\nduring their wide diffusion by various indigenous tribes. When two races\r\nin close contact cross, the first result is a heterogeneous mixture:\r\nthus Mr. Hunter, in describing the Santali or hill-tribes of India, says\r\nthat hundreds of imperceptible gradations may be traced \"from the black,\r\nsquat tribes of the mountains to the tall olive-coloured Brahman, with\r\nhis intellectual brow, calm eyes, and high but narrow head;\" so that it\r\nis necessary in courts of justice to ask the witnesses whether they are\r\nSantalis or Hindoos.[318] Whether a heterogeneous people, such as the\r\ninhabitants of some of the Polynesian islands, formed by the crossing of\r\ntwo distinct races, with few or no pure members left, would ever become\r\nhomogeneous, is not known from direct evidence. But as with our\r\ndomesticated animals, a crossed breed can certainly, in the course of a\r\nfew generations, be fixed and made uniform by careful selection,[319] we\r\nmay infer that the free and prolonged intercrossing during many\r\ngenerations of a heterogeneous mixture would supply the place of\r\nselection, and overcome any tendency to reversion, so that a crossed\r\nrace would ultimately become homogeneous, though it might not partake in\r\nan equal degree of the characters of the two parent-races.\r\n\r\nOf all the differences between the races of man, the colour of the skin\r\nis the most conspicuous and one of the best marked. Differences of this\r\nkind, it was formerly thought, could be accounted for by long exposure\r\nunder different climates; but Pallas first shewed that this view is not\r\ntenable, and he has been followed by almost all anthropologists.[320]\r\nThe view has been rejected chiefly because the distribution of the\r\nvariously coloured races, most of whom must have long inhabited their\r\npresent homes, does not coincide with corresponding differences of\r\nclimate. Weight must also be given to such cases as that of the Dutch\r\nfamilies, who, as we hear on excellent authority,[321] have not\r\nundergone the least change of colour, after residing for three centuries\r\nin South Africa. The uniform appearance in various parts of the world of\r\ngypsies and Jews, though the uniformity of the latter has been somewhat\r\nexaggerated,[322] is likewise an argument on the same side. A very damp\r\nor a very dry atmosphere has been supposed to be more influential in\r\nmodifying the colour of the skin than mere heat; but as D'Orbigny in\r\nSouth America, and Livingstone in Africa, arrived at diametrically\r\nopposite conclusions with respect to dampness and dryness, any\r\nconclusion on this head must be considered as very doubtful.[323]\r\n\r\nVarious facts, which I have elsewhere given, prove that the colour of\r\nthe skin and hair is sometimes correlated in a surprising manner with a\r\ncomplete immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons and from\r\nthe attacks of certain parasites. Hence it occurred to me, that negroes\r\nand other dark races might have acquired their dark tints by the darker\r\nindividuals escaping during a long series of generations from the deadly\r\ninfluence of the miasmas of their native countries.\r\n\r\nI afterwards found that the same idea had long ago occurred to Dr.\r\nWells.[324] That negroes, and even mulattoes, are almost completely\r\nexempt from the yellow-fever, which is so destructive in tropical\r\nAmerica, has long been known.[325] They likewise escape to a large\r\nextent the fatal intermittent fevers that prevail along, at least, 2600\r\nmiles of the shores of Africa, and which annually cause one-fifth of the\r\nwhite settlers to die, and another fifth to return home invalided.[326]\r\nThis immunity in the negro seems to be partly inherent, depending on\r\nsome unknown peculiarity of constitution, and partly the result of\r\nacclimatisation. Pouchet[327] states that the negro regiments, borrowed\r\nfrom the Viceroy of Egypt for the Mexican war, which had been recruited\r\nnear the Soudan, escaped the yellow-fever almost equally well with the\r\nnegroes originally brought from various parts of Africa, and accustomed\r\nto the climate of the West Indies. That acclimatisation plays a part is\r\nshewn by the many cases in which negroes, after having resided for some\r\ntime in a colder climate, have become to a certain extent liable to\r\ntropical fevers.[328] The nature of the climate under which the white\r\nraces have long resided, likewise has some influence on them; for during\r\nthe fearful epidemic of yellow-fever in Demerara during 1837, Dr. Blair\r\nfound that the death-rate of the immigrants was proportional to the\r\nlatitude of the country whence they had come. With the negro the\r\nimmunity, as far as it is the result of acclimatisation, implies\r\nexposure during a prodigious length of time; for the aborigines of\r\ntropical America, who have resided there from time immemorial, are not\r\nexempt from yellow-fever; and the Rev. B. Tristram states, that there\r\nare districts in Northern Africa which the native inhabitants are\r\ncompelled annually to leave, though the negroes can remain with safety.\r\n\r\nThat the immunity of the negro is in any degree correlated with the\r\ncolour of his skin is a mere conjecture: it may be correlated with some\r\ndifference in his blood, nervous system, or other tissues. Nevertheless,\r\nfrom the facts above alluded to, and from some connection apparently\r\nexisting between complexion and a tendency to consumption, the\r\nconjecture seemed to me not improbable. Consequently I endeavoured, with\r\nbut little success,[329] to ascertain how far it held good. The late\r\nDr. Daniell, who had long lived on the West Coast of Africa, told me\r\nthat he did not believe in any such relation. He was himself unusually\r\nfair, and had withstood the climate in a wonderful manner. When he first\r\narrived as a boy on the coast, an old and experienced negro chief\r\npredicted from his appearance that this would prove the case. Dr.\r\nNicholson, of Antigua, after having attended to this subject, wrote to\r\nme that he did not think that dark-coloured Europeans escaped the\r\nyellow-fever better than those that were light-coloured. Mr. J. M.\r\nHarris altogether denies[330] that Europeans with dark hair withstand a\r\nhot climate better than other men; on the contrary, experience has\r\ntaught him in making a selection of men for service on the coast of\r\nAfrica, to choose those with red hair. As far, therefore, as these\r\nslight indications serve, there seems no foundation for the hypothesis,\r\nwhich has been accepted by several writers, that the colour of the black\r\nraces may have resulted from darker and darker individuals having\r\nsurvived in greater numbers, during their exposure to the\r\nfever-generating miasmas of their native countries.\r\n\r\nAlthough with our present knowledge we cannot account for the\r\nstrongly-marked differences in colour between the races of man, either\r\nthrough correlation with constitutional peculiarities, or through the\r\ndirect action of climate; yet we must not quite ignore the latter\r\nagency, for there is good reason to believe that some inherited effect\r\nis thus produced.[331]\r\n\r\nWe have seen in our third chapter that the conditions of life, such as\r\nabundant food and general comfort, affect in a direct manner the\r\ndevelopment of the bodily frame, the effects being transmitted. Through\r\nthe combined influences of climate and changed habits of life, European\r\nsettlers, in the United States undergo, as is generally admitted, a\r\nslight but extraordinarily rapid change of appearance. There is, also, a\r\nconsiderable body of evidence shewing that in the Southern States the\r\nhouse-slaves of the third generation present a markedly different\r\nappearance from the field-slaves.[332]\r\n\r\nIf, however, we look to the races of man, as distributed over the world,\r\nwe must infer that their characteristic differences cannot be accounted\r\nfor by the direct action of different conditions of life, even after\r\nexposure to them for an enormous period of time. The Esquimaux live\r\nexclusively on animal food; they are clothed in thick fur, and are\r\nexposed to intense cold and to prolonged darkness; yet they do not\r\ndiffer in any extreme degree from the inhabitants of Southern China, who\r\nlive entirely on vegetable food and are exposed almost naked to a hot,\r\nglaring climate. The unclothed Fuegians live on the marine productions\r\nof their inhospitable shores; the Botocudos of Brazil wander about the\r\nhot forests of the interior and live chiefly on vegetable productions;\r\nyet these tribes resemble each other so closely that the Fuegians on\r\nboard the \"Beagle\" were mistaken by some Brazilians for Botocudos. The\r\nBotocudos again, as well as the other inhabitants of tropical America,\r\nare wholly different from the Negroes who inhabit the opposite shores of\r\nthe Atlantic, are exposed to a nearly similar climate, and follow nearly\r\nthe same habits of life.\r\n\r\nNor can the differences between the races of man be accounted for,\r\nexcept to a quite insignificant degree, by the inherited effects of the\r\nincreased or decreased use of parts. Men who habitually live in canoes,\r\nmay have their legs somewhat stunted; those who inhabit lofty regions\r\nhave their chests enlarged; and those who constantly use certain\r\nsense-organs have the cavities in which they are lodged somewhat\r\nincreased in size, and their features consequently a little modified.\r\nWith civilised nations, the reduced size of the jaws from lessened use,\r\nthe habitual play of different muscles serving to express different\r\nemotions, and the increased size of the brain from greater intellectual\r\nactivity, have together produced a considerable effect on their general\r\nappearance in comparison with savages.[333] It is also possible that\r\nincreased bodily stature, with no corresponding increase in the size of\r\nthe brain, may have given to some races (judging from the previously\r\nadduced cases of the rabbits) an elongated skull of the dolichocephalic\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nLastly, the little-understood principle of correlation will almost\r\ncertainly have come into action, as in the case of great muscular\r\ndevelopment and strongly projecting supra-orbital ridges. It is not\r\nimprobable that the texture of the hair, which differs much in the\r\ndifferent races, may stand in some kind of correlation with the\r\nstructure of the skin; for the colour of the hair and skin are certainly\r\ncorrelated, as is its colour and texture with the Mandans.[334] The\r\ncolour of the skin and the odour emitted by it are likewise in some\r\nmanner connected. With the breeds of sheep the number of hairs within a\r\ngiven space and the number of the excretory pores stand in some relation\r\nto each other.[335] If we may judge from the analogy of our domesticated\r\nanimals, many modifications of structure in man probably come under this\r\nprinciple of correlated growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that the characteristic differences between the races\r\nof man cannot be accounted for in a satisfactory manner by the direct\r\naction of the conditions of life, nor by the effects of the continued\r\nuse of parts, nor through the principle of correlation. We are therefore\r\nled to inquire whether slight individual differences, to which man is\r\neminently liable, may not have been preserved and augmented during a\r\nlong series of generations through natural selection. But here we are at\r\nonce met by the objection that beneficial variations alone can be thus\r\npreserved; and as far as we are enabled to judge (although always liable\r\nto error on this head) not one of the external differences between the\r\nraces of man are of any direct or special service to him. The\r\nintellectual and moral or social faculties must of course be excepted\r\nfrom this remark; but differences in these faculties can have had little\r\nor no influence on external characters. The variability of all the\r\ncharacteristic differences between the races, before referred to,\r\nlikewise indicates that these differences cannot be of much importance;\r\nfor, had they been important, they would long ago have been either fixed\r\nand preserved, or eliminated. In this respect man resembles those forms,\r\ncalled by naturalists protean or polymorphic, which have remained\r\nextremely variable, owing, as it seems, to their variations being of an\r\nindifferent nature, and consequently to their having escaped the action\r\nof natural selection.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far been baffled in all our attempts to account for the\r\ndifferences between the races of man; but there remains one important\r\nagency, namely Sexual Selection, which appears to have acted as\r\npowerfully on man, as on many other animals. I do not intend to assert\r\nthat sexual selection will account for all the differences between the\r\nraces. An unexplained residuum is left, about which we can in our\r\nignorance only say, that as individuals are continually born with, for\r\ninstance, heads a little rounder or narrower, and with noses a little\r\nlonger or shorter, such slight differences might become fixed and\r\nuniform, if the unknown agencies which induced them were to act in a\r\nmore constant manner, aided by long-continued intercrossing. Such\r\nmodifications come under the provisional class, alluded to in our fourth\r\nchapter, which for the want of a better term have been called\r\nspontaneous variations. Nor do I pretend that the effects of sexual\r\nselection can be indicated with scientific precision; but it can be\r\nshewn that it would be an inexplicable fact if man had not been modified\r\nby this agency, which has acted so powerfully on innumerable animals,\r\nboth high and low in the scale. It can further be shewn that the\r\ndifferences between the races of man, as in colour, hairyness, form of\r\nfeatures, &c., are of the nature which it might have been expected would\r\nhave been acted on by sexual selection. But in order to treat this\r\nsubject in a fitting manner, I have found it necessary to pass the whole\r\nanimal kingdom in review; I have therefore devoted to it the Second Part\r\nof this work. At the close I shall return to man, and, after attempting\r\nto shew how far he has been modified through sexual selection, will give\r\na brief summary of the chapters in this First Part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.--SEXUAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF SEXUAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary sexual characters--Sexual selection--Manner of\r\n  action--Excess of males--Polygamy--The male alone generally\r\n  modified through sexual selection--Eagerness of the\r\n  male--Variability of the male--Choice exerted by the\r\n  female--Sexual compared with natural selection--Inheritance, at\r\n  corresponding periods of life, at corresponding seasons of the\r\n  year, and as limited by sex--Relations between the several\r\n  forms of inheritance--Causes why one sex and the young are not\r\n  modified through sexual selection--Supplement on the\r\n  proportional numbers of the two sexes throughout the animal\r\n  kingdom--On the limitation of the numbers of the two sexes\r\n  through natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith animals which have their sexes separated, the males necessarily\r\ndiffer from the females in their organs of reproduction; and these\r\nafford the primary sexual characters. But the sexes often differ in what\r\nHunter has called secondary sexual characters, which are not directly\r\nconnected with the act of reproduction; for instance, in the male\r\npossessing certain organs of sense or locomotion, of which the female is\r\nquite destitute, or in having them more highly-developed, in order that\r\nhe may readily find or reach her; or again, in the male having special\r\norgans of prehension so as to hold her securely. These latter organs of\r\ninfinitely diversified kinds graduate into, and in some cases can hardly\r\nbe distinguished from, those which are commonly ranked as primary, such\r\nas the complex appendages at the apex of the abdomen in male insects.\r\nUnless indeed we confine the term \"primary\" to the reproductive glands,\r\nit is scarcely possible to decide, as far as the organs of prehension\r\nare concerned, which ought to be called primary and which secondary.\r\n\r\nThe female often differs from the male in having organs for the\r\nnourishment or protection of her young, as the mammary glands of\r\nmammals, and the abdominal sacks of the marsupials. The male, also, in\r\nsome few cases differs from the female in possessing analogous organs,\r\nas the receptacles for the ova possessed by the males of certain fishes,\r\nand those temporarily developed in certain male frogs. Female bees have\r\na special apparatus for collecting and carrying pollen, and their\r\novipositor is modified into a sting for the defence of their larvae and\r\nthe community. In the females of many insects the ovipositor is modified\r\nin the most complex manner for the safe placing of the eggs. Numerous\r\nsimilar cases could be given, but they do not here concern us. There\r\nare, however, other sexual differences quite disconnected with the\r\nprimary organs with which we are more especially concerned--such as the\r\ngreater size, strength, and pugnacity of the male, his weapons of\r\noffence or means of defence against rivals, his gaudy colouring and\r\nvarious ornaments, his power of song, and other such characters.\r\n\r\nBesides the foregoing primary and secondary sexual differences, the male\r\nand female sometimes differ in structures connected with different\r\nhabits of life, and not at all, or only indirectly, related to the\r\nreproductive functions. Thus the females of certain flies (Culicidae and\r\nTabanidae) are blood-suckers, whilst the males live on flowers and have\r\ntheir mouths destitute of mandibles.[336] The males alone of certain\r\nmoths and of some crustaceans (_e.g._ Tanais) have imperfect, closed\r\nmouths, and cannot feed. The Complemental males of certain cirripedes\r\nlive like epiphytic plants either on the female or hermaphrodite form,\r\nand are destitute of a mouth and prehensile limbs. In these cases it is\r\nthe male which has been modified and has lost certain important organs,\r\nwhich the other members of the same group possess. In other cases it is\r\nthe female which has lost such parts; for instance, the female glow-worm\r\nis destitute of wings, as are many female moths, some of which never\r\nleave their cocoons. Many female parasitic crustaceans have lost their\r\nnatatory legs. In some weevil-beetles (Curculionidae) there is a great\r\ndifference between the male and female in the length of the rostrum or\r\nsnout;[337] but the meaning of this and of many analogous differences,\r\nis not at all understood. Differences of structure between the two sexes\r\nin relation to different habits of life are generally confined to the\r\nlower animals; but with some few birds the beak of the male differs from\r\nthat of the female. No doubt in most, but apparently not in all these\r\ncases, the differences are indirectly connected with the propagation of\r\nthe species: thus a female which has to nourish a multitude of ova will\r\nrequire more food than the male, and consequently will require special\r\nmeans for procuring it. A male animal which lived for a very short time\r\nmight without detriment lose through disuse its organs for procuring\r\nfood; but he would retain his locomotive organs in a perfect state, so\r\nthat he might reach the female. The female, on the other hand, might\r\nsafely lose her organs for flying, swimming, or walking, if she\r\ngradually acquired habits which rendered such powers useless.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, here concerned only with that kind of selection, which\r\nI have called sexual selection. This depends on the advantage which\r\ncertain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and\r\nspecies, in exclusive relation to reproduction. When the two sexes\r\ndiffer in structure in relation to different habits of life, as in the\r\ncases above mentioned, they have no doubt been modified through natural\r\nselection, accompanied by inheritance limited to one and the same sex.\r\nSo again the primary sexual organs, and those for nourishing or\r\nprotecting the young, come under this same head; for those individuals\r\nwhich generated or nourished their offspring best, would leave, _caeteris\r\nparibus_, the greatest number to inherit their superiority; whilst those\r\nwhich generated or nourished their offspring badly, would leave but few\r\nto inherit their weaker powers. As the male has to search for the\r\nfemale, he requires for this purpose organs of sense and locomotion, but\r\nif these organs are necessary for the other purposes of life, as is\r\ngenerally the case, they will have been developed through natural\r\nselection. When the male has found the female he sometimes absolutely\r\nrequires prehensile organs to hold her; thus Dr. Wallace informs me that\r\nthe males of certain moths cannot unite with the females if their tarsi\r\nor feet are broken. The males of many oceanic crustaceans have their\r\nlegs and antennae modified in an extraordinary manner for the prehension\r\nof the female; hence we may suspect that owing to these animals being\r\nwashed about by the waves of the open sea, they absolutely require these\r\norgans in order to propagate their kind, and if so their development\r\nwill have been the result of ordinary or natural selection.\r\n\r\nWhen the two sexes follow exactly the same habits of life, and the male\r\nhas more highly developed sense or locomotive organs than the female, it\r\nmay be that these in their perfected state are indispensable to the male\r\nfor finding the female; but in the vast majority of cases, they serve\r\nonly to give one male an advantage over another, for the less\r\nwell-endowed males, if time were allowed them, would succeed in pairing\r\nwith the females; and they would in all other respects, judging from the\r\nstructure of the female, be equally well adapted for their ordinary\r\nhabits of life. In such cases sexual selection must have come into\r\naction, for the males have acquired their present structure, not from\r\nbeing better fitted to survive in the struggle for existence, but from\r\nhaving gained an advantage over other males, and from having transmitted\r\nthis advantage to their male offspring alone. It was the importance of\r\nthis distinction which led me to designate this form of selection as\r\nsexual selection. So again, if the chief service rendered to the male by\r\nhis prehensile organs is to prevent the escape of the female before the\r\narrival of other males, or when assaulted by them, these organs will\r\nhave been perfected through sexual selection, that is by the advantage\r\nacquired by certain males over their rivals. But in most cases it is\r\nscarcely possible to distinguish between the effects of natural and\r\nsexual selection. Whole chapters could easily be filled with details on\r\nthe differences between the sexes in their sensory, locomotive, and\r\nprehensile organs. As, however, these structures are not more\r\ninteresting than others adapted for the ordinary purposes of life, I\r\nshall almost pass them over, giving only a few instances under each\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThere are many other structures and instincts which must have been\r\ndeveloped through sexual selection--such as the weapons of offence and\r\nthe means of defence possessed by the males for fighting with and\r\ndriving away their rivals--their courage and pugnacity--their ornaments\r\nof many kinds--their organs for producing vocal or instrumental\r\nmusic--and their glands for emitting odours; most of these latter\r\nstructures serving only to allure or excite the female. That these\r\ncharacters are the result of sexual and not of ordinary selection is\r\nclear, as unarmed, unornamented, or unattractive males would succeed\r\nequally well in the battle for life and in leaving a numerous progeny,\r\nif better endowed males were not present. We may infer that this would\r\nbe the case, for the females, which are unarmed and unornamented, are\r\nable to survive and procreate their kind. Secondary sexual characters of\r\nthe kind just referred to, will be fully discussed in the following\r\nchapters, as they are in many respects interesting, but more especially\r\nas they depend on the will, choice, and rivalry of the individuals of\r\neither sex. When we behold two males fighting for the possession of the\r\nfemale, or several male birds displaying their gorgeous plumage, and\r\nperforming the strangest antics before an assembled body of females, we\r\ncannot doubt that, though led by instinct, they know what they are\r\nabout, and consciously exert their mental and bodily powers.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as man can improve the breed of his game-cocks by the\r\nselection of those birds which are victorious in the cockpit, so it\r\nappears that the strongest and most vigorous males, or those provided\r\nwith the best weapons, have prevailed under nature, and have led to the\r\nimprovement of the natural breed or species. Through repeated deadly\r\ncontests, a slight degree of variability, if it led to some advantage,\r\nhowever slight, would suffice for the work of sexual selection; and it\r\nis certain that secondary sexual characters are eminently variable. In\r\nthe same manner as man can give beauty, according to his standard of\r\ntaste, to his male poultry--can give to the Sebright bantam a new and\r\nelegant plumage, an erect and peculiar carriage--so it appears that in a\r\nstate of nature female birds, by having long selected the more\r\nattractive males, have added to their beauty. No doubt this implies\r\npowers of discrimination and taste on the part of the female which will\r\nat first appear extremely improbable; but I hope hereafter to shew that\r\nthis is not the case.\r\n\r\nFrom our ignorance on several points, the precise manner in which sexual\r\nselection acts is to a certain extent uncertain. Nevertheless if those\r\nnaturalists who already believe in the mutability of species, will read\r\nthe following chapters, they will, I think, agree with me that sexual\r\nselection has played an important part in the history of the organic\r\nworld. It is certain that with almost all animals there is a struggle\r\nbetween the males for the possession of the female. This fact is so\r\nnotorious that it would be superfluous to give instances. Hence the\r\nfemales, supposing that their mental capacity sufficed for the exertion\r\nof a choice, could select one out of several males. But in numerous\r\ncases it appears as if it had been specially arranged that there should\r\nbe a struggle between many males. Thus with migratory birds, the males\r\ngenerally arrive before the females at their place of breeding, so that\r\nmany males are ready to contend for each female. The bird-catchers\r\nassert that this is invariably the case with the nightingale and\r\nblackcap, as I am informed by Mr. Jenner Weir, who confirms the\r\nstatement with respect to the latter species.\r\n\r\nMr. Swaysland of Brighton, who has been in the habit, during the last\r\nforty years, of catching our migratory birds on their first arrival,\r\nwrites to me that he has never known the females of any species to\r\narrive before their males. During one spring he shot thirty-nine males\r\nof Ray's wagtail (_Budytes Raii_) before he saw a single female. Mr.\r\nGould has ascertained by dissection, as he informs me, that male snipes\r\narrive in this country before the females. In the case of fish, at the\r\nperiod when the salmon ascend our rivers, the males in large numbers are\r\nready to breed before the females. So it apparently is with frogs and\r\ntoads. Throughout the great class of insects the males almost always\r\nemerge from the pupal state before the other sex, so that they generally\r\nswarm for a time before any females can be seen.[338] The cause of this\r\ndifference between the males and females in their periods of arrival and\r\nmaturity is sufficiently obvious. Those males which annually first\r\nmigrated into any country, or which in the spring were first ready to\r\nbreed, or were the most eager, would leave the largest number of\r\noffspring; and these would tend to inherit similar instincts and\r\nconstitutions. On the whole there can be no doubt that with almost all\r\nanimals, in which the sexes are separate, there is a constantly\r\nrecurrent struggle between the males for the possession of the females.\r\n\r\nOur difficulty in regard to sexual selection lies in understanding how\r\nit is that the males which conquer other males, or those which prove the\r\nmost attractive to the females, leave a greater number of offspring to\r\ninherit their superiority than the beaten and less attractive males.\r\nUnless this result followed, the characters which gave to certain males\r\nan advantage over others, could not be perfected and augmented through\r\nsexual selection. When the sexes exist in exactly equal numbers, the\r\nworst-endowed males will ultimately find females (excepting where\r\npolygamy prevails), and leave as many offspring, equally well fitted for\r\ntheir general habits of life, as the best-endowed males. From various\r\nfacts and considerations, I formerly inferred that with most animals, in\r\nwhich secondary sexual characters were well developed, the males\r\nconsiderably exceeded the females in number; and this does hold good in\r\nsome few cases. If the males were to the females as two to one, or as\r\nthree to two, or even in a somewhat lower ratio, the whole affair would\r\nbe simple; for the better-armed or more attractive males would leave the\r\nlargest number of offspring. But after investigating, as far as\r\npossible, the numerical proportions of the sexes, I do not believe that\r\nany great inequality in number commonly exists. In most cases sexual\r\nselection appears to have been effective in the following manner.\r\n\r\nLet us take any species, a bird for instance, and divide the females\r\ninhabiting a district into two equal bodies: the one consisting of the\r\nmore vigorous and better-nourished individuals, and the other of the\r\nless vigorous and healthy. The former, there can be little doubt, would\r\nbe ready to breed in the spring before the others; and this is the\r\nopinion of Mr. Jenner Weir, who has during many years carefully attended\r\nto the habits of birds. There can also be no doubt that the most\r\nvigorous, healthy, and best-nourished females would on an average\r\nsucceed in rearing the largest number of offspring. The males, as we\r\nhave seen, are generally ready to breed before the females; of the males\r\nthe strongest, and with some species the best armed, drive away the\r\nweaker males; and the former would then unite with the more vigorous and\r\nbest-nourished females, as these are the first to breed. Such vigorous\r\npairs would surely rear a larger number of offspring than the retarded\r\nfemales, which would be compelled, supposing the sexes to be numerically\r\nequal, to unite with the conquered and less powerful males; and this is\r\nall that is wanted to add, in the course of successive generations, to\r\nthe size, strength and courage of the males, or to improve their\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nBut in a multitude of cases the males which conquer other males, do not\r\nobtain possession of the females, independently of choice on the part of\r\nthe latter. The courtship of animals is by no means so simple and short\r\nan affair as might be thought. The females are most excited by, or\r\nprefer pairing with, the more ornamented males, or those which are the\r\nbest songsters, or play the best antics; but it is obviously probable,\r\nas has been actually observed in some cases, that they would at the same\r\ntime prefer the more vigorous and lively males.[339] Thus the more\r\nvigorous females, which are the first to breed, will have the choice of\r\nmany males; and though they may not always select the strongest or best\r\narmed, they will select those which are vigorous and well armed, and in\r\nother respects the most attractive. Such early pairs would have the same\r\nadvantage in rearing offspring on the female side as above explained,\r\nand nearly the same advantage on the male side. And this apparently has\r\nsufficed during a long course of generations to add not only to the\r\nstrength and fighting-powers of the males, but likewise to their\r\nvarious ornaments or other attractions.\r\n\r\nIn the converse and much rarer case of the males selecting particular\r\nfemales, it is plain that those which were the most vigorous and had\r\nconquered others, would have the freest choice; and it is almost certain\r\nthat they would select vigorous as well as attractive females. Such\r\npairs would have an advantage in rearing offspring, more especially if\r\nthe male had the power to defend the female during the pairing-season,\r\nas occurs with some of the higher animals, or aided in providing for the\r\nyoung. The same principles would apply if both sexes mutually preferred\r\nand selected certain individuals of the opposite sex; supposing that\r\nthey selected not only the more attractive, but likewise the more\r\nvigorous individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Numerical Proportion of the Two Sexes._--I have remarked that sexual\r\nselection would be a simple affair if the males considerably exceeded in\r\nnumber the females. Hence I was led to investigate, as far as I could,\r\nthe proportions between the two sexes of as many animals as possible;\r\nbut the materials are scanty. I will here give only a brief abstract of\r\nthe results, retaining the details for a supplementary discussion, so as\r\nnot to interfere with the course of my argument. Domesticated animals\r\nalone afford the opportunity of ascertaining the proportional numbers at\r\nbirth; but no records have been specially kept for this purpose. By\r\nindirect means, however, I have collected a considerable body of\r\nstatistical data, from which it appears that with most of our domestic\r\nanimals the sexes are nearly equal at birth. Thus with race-horses,\r\n25,560 births have been recorded during twenty-one years, and the male\r\nbirths have been to the female births as 99.7 to 100. With greyhounds\r\nthe inequality is greater than with any other animal, for during twelve\r\nyears, out of 6878 births, the male births have been as 110.1 to 100\r\nfemale births. It is, however, in some degree doubtful whether it is\r\nsafe to infer that the same proportional numbers would hold good under\r\nnatural conditions as under domestication; for slight and unknown\r\ndifferences in the conditions affect to a certain extent the proportion\r\nof the sexes. Thus with mankind, the male births in England are as\r\n104.5, in Russia as 108.9, and with the Jews of Livornia as 120 _to_ 100\r\nfemales. The proportion is also mysteriously affected by the\r\ncircumstance of the births being legitimate or illegitimate.\r\n\r\nFor our present purpose we are concerned with the proportion of the\r\nsexes, not at birth, but at maturity, and this adds another element of\r\ndoubt; for it is a well ascertained fact that with man a considerably\r\nlarger proportion of males than of females die before or during birth,\r\nand during the first few years of infancy. So it almost certainly is\r\nwith male lambs, and so it may be with the males of other animals. The\r\nmales of some animals kill each other by fighting; or they drive each\r\nother about until they become greatly emaciated. They must, also, whilst\r\nwandering about in eager search for the females, be often exposed to\r\nvarious dangers. With many kinds of fish the males are much smaller than\r\nthe females, and they are believed often to be devoured by the latter or\r\nby other fishes. With some birds the females appear to die in larger\r\nproportion than the males: they are also liable to be destroyed on their\r\nnests, or whilst in charge of their young. With insects the female larvae\r\nare often larger than those of the males, and would consequently be more\r\nlikely to be devoured: in some cases the mature females are less active\r\nand less rapid in their movements than the males, and would not be so\r\nwell able to escape from danger. Hence, with animals in a state of\r\nnature, in order to judge of the proportions of the sexes at maturity,\r\nwe must rely on mere estimation; and this, except perhaps when the\r\ninequality is strongly marked, is but little trustworthy. Nevertheless,\r\nas far as a judgment can be formed, we may conclude from the facts given\r\nin the supplement, that the males of some few mammals, of many birds, of\r\nsome fish and insects, considerably exceed in number the females.\r\n\r\nThe proportion between the sexes fluctuates slightly during successive\r\nyears: thus with race-horses, for every 100 females born, the males\r\nvaried from 107.1 in one year to 92.6 in another year, and with\r\ngreyhounds from 116.3 to 95.3. But had larger numbers been tabulated\r\nthroughout a more extensive area than England, these fluctuations would\r\nprobably have disappeared; and such as they are, they would hardly\r\nsuffice to lead under a state of nature to the effective action of\r\nsexual selection. Nevertheless with some few wild animals, the\r\nproportions seem, as shewn in the supplement, to fluctuate either during\r\ndifferent seasons or in different localities in a sufficient degree to\r\nlead to such action. For it should be observed that any advantage gained\r\nduring certain years or in certain localities by those males which were\r\nable to conquer other males, or were the most attractive to the females,\r\nwould probably be transmitted to the offspring and would not\r\nsubsequently be eliminated. During the succeeding seasons, when from the\r\nequality of the sexes every male was everywhere able to procure a\r\nfemale, the stronger or more attractive males previously produced would\r\nstill have at least as good a chance of leaving offspring as the less\r\nstrong or less attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polygamy._--The practice of polygamy leads to the same results as\r\nwould follow from an actual inequality in the number of the sexes; for\r\nif each male secures two or more females, many males will not be able to\r\npair; and the latter assuredly will be the weaker or less attractive\r\nindividuals. Many mammals and some few birds are polygamous, but with\r\nanimals belonging to the lower classes I have found no evidence of this\r\nhabit. The intellectual powers of such animals are, perhaps, not\r\nsufficient to lead them to collect and guard a harem of females. That\r\nsome relation exists between polygamy and the development of secondary\r\nsexual characters, appears nearly certain; and this supports the view\r\nthat a numerical preponderance of males would be eminently favourable to\r\nthe action of sexual selection. Nevertheless many animals, especially\r\nbirds, which are strictly monogamous, display strongly-marked secondary\r\nsexual characters; whilst some few animals, which are polygamous, are\r\nnot thus characterised.\r\n\r\nWe will first briefly run through the class of mammals, and then turn to\r\nbirds. The gorilla seems to be a polygamist, and the male differs\r\nconsiderably from the female; so it is with some baboons which live in\r\nherds containing twice as many adult females as males. In South America\r\nthe _Mycetes caraya_ presents well-marked sexual differences in colour,\r\nbeard, and vocal organs, and the male generally lives with two or three\r\nwives: the male of the _Cebus capucinus_ differs somewhat from the\r\nfemale, and appears to be polygamous.[340] Little is known on this head\r\nwith respect to most other monkeys, but some species are strictly\r\nmonogamous. The ruminants are eminently polygamous, and they more\r\nfrequently present sexual differences than almost any other group of\r\nmammals, especially in their weapons, but likewise in other characters.\r\nMost deer, cattle, and sheep are polygamous; as are most antelopes,\r\nthough some of the latter are monogamous. Sir Andrew Smith, in speaking\r\nof the antelopes of South Africa, says that in herds of about a dozen\r\nthere was rarely more than one mature male. The Asiatic _Antilope saiga_\r\nappears to be the most inordinate polygamist in the world; for\r\nPallas[341] states that the male drives away all rivals, and collects a\r\nherd of about a hundred, consisting of females and kids: the female is\r\nhornless and has softer hair, but does not otherwise differ much from\r\nthe male. The horse is polygamous, but, except in his greater size and\r\nin the proportions of his body, differs but little from the mare. The\r\nwild boar, in his great tusks and some other characters, presents\r\nwell-marked sexual characters; in Europe and in India he leads a\r\nsolitary life, except during the breeding-season; but at this season he\r\nconsorts in India with several females, as Sir W. Elliot, who has had\r\nlarge experience in observing this animal, believes: whether this holds\r\ngood in Europe is doubtful, but is supported by some statements. The\r\nadult male Indian elephant, like the boar, passes much of his time in\r\nsolitude; but when associating with others, \"it is rare to find,\" as Dr.\r\nCampbell states, \"more than one male with a whole herd of females.\" The\r\nlarger males expel or kill the smaller and weaker ones. The male differs\r\nfrom the female by his immense tusks and greater size, strength, and\r\nendurance; so great is the difference in these latter respects, that\r\nthe males when caught are valued at twenty per cent. above the\r\nfemales.[342] With other pachydermatous animals the sexes differ very\r\nlittle or not at all, and they are not, as far as known, polygamists.\r\nHardly a single species amongst the Cheiroptera and Edentata, or in the\r\ngreat Orders of the Rodents and Insectivora, presents well-developed\r\nsecondary sexual differences; and I can find no account of any species\r\nbeing polygamous, excepting, perhaps, the common rat, the males of\r\nwhich, as some rat-catchers affirm, live with several females.\r\n\r\nThe lion in South Africa, as I hear from Sir Andrew Smith, sometimes\r\nlives with a single female, but generally with more than one, and, in\r\none case, was found with as many as five females, so that he is\r\npolygamous. He is, as far as I can discover, the sole polygamist in the\r\nwhole group of the terrestrial Carnivora, and he alone presents\r\nwell-marked sexual characters. If, however, we turn to the marine\r\nCarnivora, the case is widely different; for many species of seals\r\noffer, as we shall hereafter see, extraordinary sexual differences, and\r\nthey are eminently polygamous. Thus the male sea-elephant of the\r\nSouthern Ocean, always possesses, according to Peron, several females,\r\nand the sea-lion of Forster is said to be surrounded by from twenty to\r\nthirty females. In the North, the male sea-bear of Steller is\r\naccompanied by even a greater number of females.\r\n\r\nWith respect to birds, many species, the sexes of which differ greatly\r\nfrom each other, are certainly monogamous. In Great Britain we see\r\nwell-marked sexual differences in, for instance, the wild-duck which\r\npairs with a single female, with the common blackbird, and with the\r\nbullfinch which is said to pair for life. So it is, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Wallace, with the Chatterers or Cotingidae of South America, and\r\nnumerous other birds. In several groups I have not been able to discover\r\nwhether the species are polygamous or monogamous. Lesson says that birds\r\nof paradise, so remarkable for their sexual differences, are polygamous,\r\nbut Mr. Wallace doubts whether he had sufficient evidence. Mr. Salvin\r\ninforms me that he has been led to believe that humming-birds are\r\npolygamous. The male widow-bird; remarkable for his caudal plumes,\r\ncertainly seems to be a polygamist.[343] I have been assured by Mr.\r\nJenner Weir and by others, that three starlings not rarely frequent the\r\nsame nest; but whether this is a case of polygamy or polyandry has not\r\nbeen ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe Gallinaceae present almost as strongly marked sexual differences as\r\nbirds of paradise or humming-birds, and many of the species are, as is\r\nwell known, polygamous; others being strictly monogamous. What a\r\ncontrast is presented between the sexes by the polygamous peacock or\r\npheasant, and the monogamous guinea-fowl or partridge! Many similar\r\ncases could be given, as in the grouse tribe, in which the males of the\r\npolygamous capercailzie and black-cock differ greatly from the females;\r\nwhilst the sexes of the monogamous red grouse and ptarmigan differ very\r\nlittle. Amongst the Cursores, no great number of species offer\r\nstrongly-marked sexual differences, except the bustards, and the great\r\nbustard (_Otis tarda_), is said to be polygamous. With the Grallatores,\r\nextremely few species differ sexually, but the ruff (_Machetes pugnax_)\r\naffords a strong exception, and this species is believed by Montagu to\r\nbe a polygamist. Hence it appears that with birds there often exists a\r\nclose relation between polygamy and the development of strongly-marked\r\nsexual differences. On asking Mr. Bartlett, at the Zoological Gardens,\r\nwho has had such large experience with birds, whether the male tragopan\r\n(one of the Gallinaceae) was polygamous, I was struck by his answering,\r\n\"I do not know, but should think so from his splendid colours.\"\r\n\r\nIt deserves notice that the instinct of pairing with a single female is\r\neasily lost under domestication. The wild-duck is strictly monogamous,\r\nthe domestic-duck highly polygamous. The Rev. W. D. Fox informs me that\r\nwith some half-tamed wild-ducks, kept on a large pond in his\r\nneighbourhood, so many mallards were shot by the gamekeeper that only\r\none was left for every seven or eight females; yet unusually large\r\nbroods were reared. The guinea-fowl is strictly monogamous; but Mr. Fox\r\nfinds that his birds succeed best when he keeps one cock to two or three\r\nhens.[344] Canary-birds pair in a state of nature, but the breeders in\r\nEngland successfully put one male to four or five females; nevertheless\r\nthe first female, as Mr. Fox has been assured, is alone treated as the\r\nwife, she and her young ones being fed by him; the others are treated as\r\nconcubines. I have noticed these cases, as it renders it in some degree\r\nprobable that monogamous species, in a state of nature, might readily\r\nbecome either temporarily or permanently polygamous.\r\n\r\nWith respect to reptiles and fishes, too little is known of their habits\r\nto enable us to speak of their marriage arrangements. The stickle-back\r\nGasterosteus, however, is said to be a polygamist;[345] and the male\r\nduring the breeding-season differs conspicuously from the female.\r\n\r\nTo sum up on the means through which, as far as we can judge, sexual\r\nselection has led to the development of secondary sexual characters. It\r\nhas been shewn that the largest number of vigorous offspring will be\r\nreared from the pairing of the strongest and best-armed males, which\r\nhave conquered other males, with the most vigorous and best-nourished\r\nfemales, which are the first to breed in the spring. Such females, if\r\nthey select the more attractive, and at the same time vigorous, males,\r\nwill rear a larger number of offspring than the retarded females, which\r\nmust pair with the less vigorous and less attractive males. So it will\r\nbe if the more vigorous males select the more attractive and at the same\r\ntime healthy and vigorous females; and this will especially hold good if\r\nthe male defends the female, and aids in providing food for the young.\r\nThe advantage thus gained by the more vigorous pairs in rearing a larger\r\nnumber of offspring has apparently sufficed to render sexual selection\r\nefficient. But a large preponderance in number of the males over the\r\nfemales would be still more efficient; whether the preponderance was\r\nonly occasional and local, or permanent; whether it occurred at birth,\r\nor subsequently from the greater destruction of the females; or whether\r\nit indirectly followed from the practice of polygamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Male generally more modified than the Female._--Throughout the\r\nanimal kingdom, when the sexes differ from each other in external\r\nappearance, it is the male which, with rare exceptions, has been chiefly\r\nmodified; for the female still remains more like the young of her own\r\nspecies, and more like the other members of the same group. The cause of\r\nthis seems to lie in the males of almost all animals having stronger\r\npassions than the females. Hence it is the males that fight together and\r\nsedulously display their charms before the females; and those which are\r\nvictorious transmit their superiority to their male offspring. Why the\r\nmales do not transmit their characters to both sexes will hereafter be\r\nconsidered. That the males of all mammals eagerly pursue the females is\r\nnotorious to every one. So it is with birds; but many male birds do not\r\nso much pursue the female, as display their plumage, perform strange\r\nantics, and pour forth their song, in her presence. With the few fish\r\nwhich have been observed, the male seems much more eager than the\r\nfemale; and so it is with alligators, and apparently with Batrachians.\r\nThroughout the enormous class of insects, as Kirby remarks,[346] \"the\r\nlaw is, that the male shall seek the female.\" With spiders and\r\ncrustaceans, as I hear from two great authorities, Mr. Blackwall and Mr.\r\nC. Spence Bate, the males are more active and more erratic in their\r\nhabits than the females. With insects and crustaceans, when the organs\r\nof sense or locomotion are present in the one sex and absent in the\r\nother, or when, as is frequently the case, they are more highly\r\ndeveloped in the one than the other, it is almost invariably the male,\r\nas far as I can discover, which retains such organs, or has them most\r\ndeveloped; and this shews that the male is the more active member in the\r\ncourtship of the sexes.[347]\r\n\r\nThe female, on the other hand, with the rarest exception, is less eager\r\nthan the male. As the illustrious Hunter[348] long ago observed, she\r\ngenerally \"requires to be courted;\" she is coy, and may often be seen\r\nendeavouring for a long time to escape from the male. Every one who has\r\nattended to the habits of animals will be able to call to mind instances\r\nof this kind. Judging from various facts, hereafter to be given, and\r\nfrom the results which may fairly be attributed to sexual selection, the\r\nfemale, though comparatively passive, generally exerts some choice and\r\naccepts one male in preference to others. Or she may accept, as\r\nappearances would sometimes lead us to believe, not the male which is\r\nthe most attractive to her, but the one which is the least distasteful.\r\nThe exertion of some choice on the part of the female seems almost as\r\ngeneral a law as the eagerness of the male.\r\n\r\nWe are naturally led to enquire why the male in so many and such widely\r\ndistinct classes has been rendered more eager than the female, so that\r\nhe searches for her and plays the more active part in courtship. It\r\nwould be no advantage and some loss of power if both sexes were mutually\r\nto search for each other; but why should the male almost always be the\r\nseeker? With plants, the ovules after fertilisation have to be nourished\r\nfor a time; hence the pollen is necessarily brought to the female\r\norgans--being placed on the stigma, through the agency of insects or of\r\nthe wind, or by the spontaneous movements of the stamens; and with the\r\nAlgae, &c., by the locomotive power of the antherozooids. With\r\nlowly-organised animals permanently affixed to the same spot and having\r\ntheir sexes separate, the male element is invariably brought to the\r\nfemale; and we can see the reason; for the ova, even if detached before\r\nbeing fertilised and not requiring subsequent nourishment or protection,\r\nwould be, from their larger relative size, less easily transported than\r\nthe male element. Hence plants[349] and many of the lower animals are,\r\nin this respect, analogous. In the case of animals not affixed to the\r\nsame spot, but enclosed within a shell with no power of protruding any\r\npart of their bodies, and in the case of animals having little power of\r\nlocomotion, the males must trust the fertilising element to the risk of\r\nat least a short transit through the waters of the sea. It would,\r\ntherefore, be a great advantage to such animals, as their organisation\r\nbecame perfected, if the males when ready to emit the fertilising\r\nelement, were to acquire the habit of approaching the female as closely\r\nas possible. The males of various lowly-organised animals having thus\r\naboriginally acquired the habit of approaching and seeking the females,\r\nthe same habit would naturally be transmitted to their more highly\r\ndeveloped male descendants; and in order that they should become\r\nefficient seekers, they would have to be endowed with strong passions.\r\nThe acquirement of such passions would naturally follow from the more\r\neager males leaving a larger number of offspring than the less eager.\r\n\r\nThe great eagerness of the male has thus indirectly led to the much\r\nmore frequent development of secondary sexual characters in the male\r\nthan in the female. But the development of such characters will have\r\nbeen much aided, if the conclusion at which I arrived after studying\r\ndomesticated animals, can be trusted, namely, that the male is more\r\nliable to vary than the female. I am aware how difficult it is to verify\r\na conclusion of this kind. Some slight evidence, however, can be gained\r\nby comparing the two sexes in mankind, as man has been more carefully\r\nobserved than any other animal. During the Novara Expedition[350] a vast\r\nnumber of measurements of various parts of the body in different races\r\nwere made, and the men were found in almost every case to present a\r\ngreater range of variation than the women; but I shall have to recur to\r\nthis subject in a future chapter. Mr. J. Wood,[351] who has carefully\r\nattended to the variation of the muscles in man, puts in italics the\r\nconclusion that \"the greatest number of abnormalities in each subject is\r\nfound in the males.\" He had previously remarked that \"altogether in 102\r\nsubjects the varieties of redundancy were found to be half as many again\r\nas in females, contrasting widely with the greater frequency of\r\ndeficiency in females before described.\" Professor Macalister like wise\r\nremarks[352] that variations in the muscles \"are probably more common in\r\nmales than females.\" Certain muscles which are not normally present in\r\nmankind are also more frequently developed in the male than in the\r\nfemale sex, although exceptions to this rule are said to occur. Dr.\r\nBurt Wilder[353] has tabulated the cases of 152 individuals with\r\nsupernumerary digits, of which 86 were males, and 39, or less than half,\r\nfemales; the remaining 27 being of unknown sex. It should not, however,\r\nbe overlooked that women would more frequently endeavour to conceal a\r\ndeformity of this kind than men. Whether the large proportional number\r\nof deaths of the male offspring of man and apparently of sheep, compared\r\nwith the female offspring, before, during, and shortly after birth (see\r\nsupplement), has any relation to a stronger tendency in the organs of\r\nthe male to vary and thus to become abnormal in structure or function, I\r\nwill not pretend to conjecture.\r\n\r\nIn various classes of animals a few exceptional cases occur, in which\r\nthe female instead of the male has acquired well pronounced secondary\r\nsexual characters, such as brighter colours, greater size, strength, or\r\npugnacity. With birds, as we shall hereafter see, there has sometimes\r\nbeen a complete transposition of the ordinary characters proper to each\r\nsex; the females having become the more eager in courtship, the males\r\nremaining comparatively passive, but apparently selecting, as we may\r\ninfer from the results, the more attractive females. Certain female\r\nbirds have thus been rendered more highly coloured or otherwise\r\nornamented, as well as more powerful and pugnacious than the males,\r\nthese characters being transmitted to the female offspring alone.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that in some cases a double process of selection has\r\nbeen carried on; the males having selected the more attractive females,\r\nand the latter the more attractive males. This process however, though\r\nit might lead to the modification of both sexes, would not make the one\r\nsex different from the other, unless indeed their taste for the\r\nbeautiful differed; but this is a supposition too improbable in the case\r\nof any animal, excepting man, to be worth considering. There are,\r\nhowever, many animals, in which the sexes resemble each other, both\r\nbeing furnished with the same ornaments, which analogy would lead us to\r\nattribute to the agency of sexual selection. In such cases it may be\r\nsuggested with more plausibility, that there has been a double or mutual\r\nprocess of sexual selection; the more vigorous and precocious females\r\nhaving selected the more attractive and vigorous males, the latter\r\nhaving rejected all except the more attractive females. But from what we\r\nknow of the habits of animals, this view is hardly probable, the male\r\nbeing generally eager to pair with any female. It is more probable that\r\nthe ornaments common to both sexes were acquired by one sex, generally\r\nthe male, and then transmitted to the offspring of both sexes. If,\r\nindeed, during a lengthened period the males of any species were greatly\r\nto exceed the females in number, and then during another lengthened\r\nperiod under different conditions the reverse were to occur, a double,\r\nbut not simultaneous, process of sexual selection might easily be\r\ncarried on, by which the two sexes might be rendered widely different.\r\n\r\nWe shall hereafter see that many animals exist, of which neither sex is\r\nbrilliantly coloured or provided with special ornaments, and yet the\r\nmembers of both sexes or of one alone have probably been modified\r\nthrough sexual selection. The absence of bright tints or other ornaments\r\nmay be the result of variations of the right kind never having occurred,\r\nor of the animals themselves preferring simple colours, such as plain\r\nblack or white. Obscure colours have often been acquired through natural\r\nselection for the sake of protection, and the acquirement through\r\nsexual selection of conspicuous colours, may have been checked from the\r\ndanger thus incurred. But in other cases the males have probably\r\nstruggled together during long ages, through brute force, or by the\r\ndisplay of their charms, or by both means combined, and yet no effect\r\nwill have been produced unless a larger number of offspring were left by\r\nthe more successful males to inherit their superiority, than by the less\r\nsuccessful males; and this, as previously shewn, depends on various\r\ncomplex contingencies.\r\n\r\nSexual selection acts in a less rigorous manner than natural selection.\r\nThe latter produces its effects by the life or death at all ages of the\r\nmore or less successful individuals. Death, indeed, not rarely ensues\r\nfrom the conflicts of rival males. But generally the less successful\r\nmale merely fails to obtain a female, or obtains later in the season a\r\nretarded and less vigorous female, or, if polygamous, obtains fewer\r\nfemales; so that they leave fewer, or less vigorous, or no offspring. In\r\nregard to structures acquired through ordinary or natural selection,\r\nthere is in most cases, as long as the conditions of life remain the\r\nsame, a limit to the amount of advantageous modification in relation to\r\ncertain special ends; but in regard to structures adapted to make one\r\nmale victorious over another, either in fighting or in charming the\r\nfemale, there is no definite limit to the amount of advantageous\r\nmodification; so that as long as the proper variations arise the work of\r\nsexual selection will go on. This circumstance may partly account for\r\nthe frequent and extraordinary amount of variability presented by\r\nsecondary sexual characters. Nevertheless, natural selection will\r\ndetermine that characters of this kind shall not be acquired by the\r\nvictorious males, which would be injurious to them in any high degree,\r\neither by expending too much of their vital powers, or by exposing them\r\nto any great danger. The development, however, of certain structures--of\r\nthe horns, for instance, in certain stags--has been carried to a\r\nwonderful extreme; and in some instances to an extreme which, as far as\r\nthe general conditions of life are concerned, must be slightly injurious\r\nto the male. From this fact we learn that the advantages which favoured\r\nmales have derived from conquering other males in battle or courtship,\r\nand thus leaving a numerous progeny, have been in the long run greater\r\nthan those derived from rather more perfect adaptation to the external\r\nconditions of life. We shall further see, and this could never have been\r\nanticipated, that the power to charm the female has been in some few\r\ninstances more important than the power to conquer other males in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS OF INHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how sexual selection has acted, and in the course\r\nof ages has produced conspicuous results with many animals of many\r\nclasses, it is necessary to bear in mind the laws of inheritance, as far\r\nas they are known. Two distinct elements are included under the term\r\n\"inheritance,\" namely the transmission and the development of\r\ncharacters; but as these generally go together, the distinction is often\r\noverlooked. We see this distinction in those characters which are\r\ntransmitted through the early years of life, but are developed only at\r\nmaturity or during old age. We see the same distinction more clearly\r\nwith secondary sexual characters, for these are transmitted through both\r\nsexes, though developed in one alone. That they are present in both\r\nsexes, is manifest when two species, having strongly-marked sexual\r\ncharacters, are crossed, for each transmits the characters proper to\r\nits own male and female sex to the hybrid offspring of both sexes. The\r\nsame fact is likewise manifest, when characters proper to the male are\r\noccasionally developed in the female when she grows old or becomes\r\ndiseased; and so conversely with the male. Again, characters\r\noccasionally appear, as if transferred from the male to the female, as\r\nwhen, in certain breeds of the fowl, spurs regularly appear in the young\r\nand healthy females; but in truth they are simply developed in the\r\nfemale; for in every breed each detail in the structure of the spur is\r\ntransmitted through the female to her male offspring. In all cases of\r\nreversion, characters are transmitted through two, three, or many\r\ngenerations, and are then under certain unknown favourable conditions\r\ndeveloped. This important distinction between transmission and\r\ndevelopment will be easiest kept in mind by the aid of the hypothesis of\r\npangenesis, whether or not it be accepted as true. According to this\r\nhypothesis, every unit or cell of the body throws off gemmules or\r\nundeveloped atoms, which are transmitted to the offspring of both sexes,\r\nand are multiplied by self-division. They may remain undeveloped during\r\nthe early years of life or during successive generations; their\r\ndevelopment into units or cells, like those from which they were\r\nderived, depending on their affinity for, and union with, other units or\r\ncells previously developed in the due order of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inheritance at Corresponding Periods of Life._--This tendency is well\r\nestablished. If a new character appears in an animal whilst young,\r\nwhether it endures throughout life or lasts only for a time, it will\r\nreappear, as a general rule, at the same age and in the same manner in\r\nthe offspring. If, on the other hand, a new character appears at\r\nmaturity, or even during old age, it tends to reappear in the offspring\r\nat the same advanced age. When deviations from this rule occur, the\r\ntransmitted characters much oftener appear before than after the\r\ncorresponding age. As I have discussed this subject at sufficient length\r\nin another work,[354] I will here merely give two or three instances,\r\nfor the sake of recalling the subject to the reader's mind. In several\r\nbreeds of the Fowl, the chickens whilst covered with down, in their\r\nfirst true plumage, and in their adult plumage, differ greatly from each\r\nother, as well as from their common parent-form, the _Gallus bankiva_;\r\nand these characters are faithfully transmitted by each breed to their\r\noffspring at the corresponding period of life. For instance, the\r\nchickens of spangled Hamburghs, whilst covered with down, have a few\r\ndark spots on the head and rump, but are not longitudinally striped, as\r\nin many other breeds; in their first true plumage, \"they are beautifully\r\npencilled,\" that is each feather is transversely marked by numerous dark\r\nbars; but in their second plumage the feathers all become spangled or\r\ntipped with a dark round spot.[355] Hence in this breed variations have\r\noccurred and have been transmitted at three distinct periods of life.\r\nThe Pigeon offers a more remarkable case, because the aboriginal\r\nparent-species does not undergo with advancing age any change of\r\nplumage, excepting that at maturity the breast becomes more iridescent;\r\nyet there are breeds which do not acquire their characteristic colours\r\nuntil they have moulted two, three, or four times; and these\r\nmodifications of plumage are regularly transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inheritance at Corresponding Seasons of the Year._--With animals in a\r\nstate of nature innumerable instances occur of characters periodically\r\nappearing at different seasons. We see this with the horns of the stag,\r\nand with the fur of arctic animals which becomes thick and white during\r\nthe winter. Numerous birds acquire bright colours and other decorations\r\nduring the breeding-season alone. I can throw but little light on this\r\nform of inheritance from facts observed under domestication. Pallas\r\nstates,[356] that in Siberia domestic cattle and horses periodically\r\nbecome lighter-coloured during the winter; and I have observed a similar\r\nmarked change of colour in certain ponies in England. Although I do not\r\nknow that this tendency to assume a differently coloured coat during\r\ndifferent seasons of the year is transmitted, yet it probably is so, as\r\nall shades of colour are strongly inherited by the horse. Nor is this\r\nform of inheritance, as limited by season, more remarkable than\r\ninheritance as limited by age or sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inheritance as Limited by Sex._--The equal transmission of characters\r\nto both, sexes is the commonest form of inheritance, at least with those\r\nanimals which do not present strongly-marked sexual differences, and\r\nindeed with many of these. But characters are not rarely transferred\r\nexclusively to that sex, in which they first appeared. Ample evidence on\r\nthis head has been advanced in my work on Variation under\r\nDomestication; but a few instances may here be given. There are breeds\r\nof the sheep and goat, in which the horns of the male differ greatly in\r\nshape from those of the female; and these differences, acquired under\r\ndomestication, are regularly transmitted to the same sex. With\r\ntortoise-shell cats the females alone, as a general rule, are thus\r\ncoloured, the males being rusty-red. With most breeds of the fowl, the\r\ncharacters proper to each sex are transmitted to the same sex alone. So\r\ngeneral is this form of transmission that it is an anomaly when we see\r\nin certain breeds variations transmitted equally to both sexes. There\r\nare also certain sub-breeds of the fowl in which the males can hardly be\r\ndistinguished from each other, whilst the females differ considerably in\r\ncolour. With the pigeon the sexes of the parent-species do not differ in\r\nany external character; nevertheless in certain domesticated breeds the\r\nmale is differently coloured from the female.[357] The wattle in the\r\nEnglish Carrier pigeon and the crop in the Pouter are more highly\r\ndeveloped in the male than in the female; and although these characters\r\nhave been gained through long-continued selection by man, the difference\r\nbetween the two sexes is wholly due to the form of inheritance which has\r\nprevailed; for it has arisen, not from, but rather in opposition to, the\r\nwishes of the breeder.\r\n\r\nMost of our domestic races have been formed by the accumulation of many\r\nslight variations; and as some of the successive steps have been\r\ntransmitted to one sex alone, and some to both sexes, we find in the\r\ndifferent breeds of the same species all gradations between great sexual\r\ndissimilarity and complete similarity. Instances have already been\r\ngiven with the breeds of the fowl and pigeon; and under nature analogous\r\ncases are of frequent occurrence. With animals under domestication, but\r\nwhether under nature I will not venture to say, one sex may lose\r\ncharacters proper to it, and may thus come to resemble to a certain\r\nextent the opposite sex; for instance, the males of some breeds of the\r\nfowl have lost their masculine plumes and hackles. On the other hand the\r\ndifferences between the sexes may be increased under domestication, as\r\nwith merino sheep, in which the ewes have lost their horns. Again,\r\ncharacters proper to one sex may suddenly appear in the other sex; as\r\nwith those sub-breeds of the fowl in which the hens whilst young acquire\r\nspurs; or, as in certain Polish sub-breeds, in which the females, as\r\nthere is reason to believe, originally acquired a crest, and\r\nsubsequently transferred it to the males. All these cases are\r\nintelligible on the hypothesis of pangenesis; for they depend on the\r\ngemmules of certain units of the body, although present in both sexes,\r\nbecoming through the influence of domestication dormant in the one sex;\r\nor if naturally dormant, becoming developed.\r\n\r\nThere is one difficult question which it will be convenient to defer to\r\na future chapter; namely, whether a character at first developed in both\r\nsexes, can be rendered through selection limited in its development to\r\none sex alone. If, for instance, a breeder observed that some of his\r\npigeons (in which species characters are usually transferred in an equal\r\ndegree to both sexes) varied into pale blue; could he by long-continued\r\nselection make a breed, in which the males alone should be of this tint,\r\nwhilst the females remained unchanged? I will here only say, that this,\r\nthough perhaps not impossible, would be extremely difficult; for the\r\nnatural result of breeding from the pale-blue males would be to change\r\nhis whole stock, including both sexes, into this tint. If, however,\r\nvariations of the desired tint appeared, which were from the first\r\nlimited in their development to the male sex, there would not be the\r\nleast difficulty in making a breed characterised by the two sexes being\r\nof a different colour, as indeed has been effected with a Belgian breed,\r\nin which the males alone are streaked with black. In a similar manner,\r\nif any variation appeared in a female pigeon, which was from the first\r\nsexually limited in its development, it would be easy to make a breed\r\nwith the females alone thus characterised; but if the variation was not\r\nthus originally limited, the process would be extremely difficult,\r\nperhaps impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Relation between the period of Development of a Character and\r\nits transmission to one sex or to both sexes._--Why certain characters\r\nshould be inherited by both sexes, and other characters by one sex\r\nalone, namely by that sex in which the character first appeared, is in\r\nmost cases quite unknown. We cannot even conjecture why with certain\r\nsub-breeds of the pigeon, black striae, though transmitted through the\r\nfemale, should be developed in the male alone, whilst every other\r\ncharacter is equally transferred to both sexes. Why, again, with cats,\r\nthe tortoise-shell colour should, with rare exceptions, be developed in\r\nthe female alone. The very same characters, such as deficient or\r\nsupernumerary digits, colour-blindness, &c., may with mankind be\r\ninherited by the males alone of one family, and in another family by the\r\nfemales alone, though in both cases transmitted through the opposite as\r\nwell as the same sex.[358] Although we are thus ignorant, two rules\r\noften hold good, namely that variations which, first appear in either\r\nsex at a late period of life, tend to be developed in the same sex\r\nalone; whilst variations which first appear early in life in either sex\r\ntend to be developed in both sexes. I am, however, far from supposing\r\nthat this is the sole determining cause. As I have not elsewhere\r\ndiscussed this subject, and as it has an important bearing on sexual\r\nselection, I must here enter into lengthy and somewhat intricate\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nIt is in itself probable that any character appearing at an early age\r\nwould tend to be inherited equally by both sexes, for the sexes do not\r\ndiffer much in constitution, before the power of reproduction is gained.\r\nOn the other hand, after this power has been gained and the sexes have\r\ncome to differ in constitution, the gemmules (if I may again use the\r\nlanguage of pangenesis) which are cast off from each varying part in the\r\none sex would be much more likely to possess the proper affinities for\r\nuniting with the tissues of the same sex, and thus becoming developed,\r\nthan with those of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nI was first led to infer that a relation of this kind exists, from the\r\nfact that whenever and in whatever manner the adult male has come to\r\ndiffer from the adult female, he differs in the same manner from the\r\nyoung of both sexes. The generality of this fact is quite remarkable: it\r\nholds good with almost all mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes; also\r\nwith many crustaceans, spiders and some few insects, namely certain\r\northoptera and libellulae. In all these cases the variations, through the\r\naccumulation of which the male acquired his proper masculine characters,\r\nmust have occurred at a somewhat late period of life; otherwise the\r\nyoung males would have been similarly characterised; and conformably\r\nwith our rule, they are transmitted to and developed in the adult males\r\nalone. When, on the other hand, the adult male closely resembles the\r\nyoung of both sexes (these, with rare exceptions, being alike), he\r\ngenerally resembles the adult female; and in most of these cases the\r\nvariations through which the young and old acquired their present\r\ncharacters, probably occurred in conformity with our rule during youth.\r\nBut there is here room for doubt, as characters are sometimes\r\ntransferred to the offspring at an earlier age than that at which they\r\nfirst appeared in the parents, so that the parents may have varied when\r\nadult, and have transferred their characters to their offspring whilst\r\nyoung. There are, moreover, many animals, in which the two sexes closely\r\nresemble each other, and yet both differ from their young; and here the\r\ncharacters of the adults must have been acquired late in life;\r\nnevertheless, these characters in apparent contradiction to our rule,\r\nare transferred to both sexes. We must not, however, overlook the\r\npossibility or even probability of successive variations of the same\r\nnature sometimes occurring, under exposure to similar conditions,\r\nsimultaneously in both sexes at a rather late period of life; and in\r\nthis case the variations would be transferred to the offspring of both\r\nsexes at a corresponding late age; and there would be no real\r\ncontradiction to our rule of the variations which occur late in life\r\nbeing transferred exclusively to the sex in which they first appeared.\r\nThis latter rule seems to hold true more generally than the second rule,\r\nnamely, that variations which occur in either sex early in life tend to\r\nbe transferred to both sexes. As it was obviously impossible even to\r\nestimate in how large a number of cases throughout the animal kingdom\r\nthese two propositions hold good, it occurred to me to investigate some\r\nstriking or crucial instances, and to rely on the result.\r\n\r\nAn excellent case for investigation is afforded by the Deer Family. In\r\nall the species, excepting one, the horns are developed in the male\r\nalone, though certainly transmitted through the female, and capable of\r\noccasional abnormal development in her. In the reindeer, on the other\r\nhand, the female is provided with horns; so that in this species, the\r\nhorns ought, according to our rule, to appear early in life, long before\r\nthe two sexes had arrived at maturity and had come to differ much in\r\nconstitution. In all the other species of deer the horns ought to appear\r\nlater in life, leading to their development in that sex alone, in which\r\nthey first appeared in the progenitor of the whole Family. Now in seven\r\nspecies, belonging to distinct sections of the family and inhabiting\r\ndifferent regions, in which the stags alone bear horns, I find that the\r\nhorns first appear at periods varying from nine months after birth in\r\nthe roebuck to ten or twelve or even more months in the stags of the six\r\nother larger species.[359] But with the reindeer the case is widely\r\ndifferent, for as I hear from Prof. Nilsson, who kindly made special\r\nenquiries for me in Lapland, the horns appear in the young animals\r\nwithin four or five weeks after birth, and at the same time in both\r\nsexes. So that here we have a structure, developed at a most unusually\r\nearly age in one species of the family, and common to both sexes in this\r\none species.\r\n\r\nIn several kinds of antelopes the males alone are provided with horns,\r\nwhilst in the greater number both sexes have horns. With respect to the\r\nperiod of development, Mr. Blyth informs me that there lived at one time\r\nin the Zoological Gardens a young koodoo (_Ant. strepsiceros_), in which\r\nspecies the males alone are horned, and the young of a closely-allied\r\nspecies, viz. the eland (_Ant. oreas_), in which both sexes are horned.\r\nNow in strict conformity with our rule, in the young male koodoo,\r\nalthough arrived at the age of ten months, the horns were remarkably\r\nsmall considering the size ultimately attained by them: whilst in the\r\nyoung male eland, although only three months old, the horns were already\r\nvery much larger than in the koodoo. It is also worth notice that in the\r\nprong-horned antelope,[360] in which species the horns, though present\r\nin both sexes, are almost rudimentary in the female, they do not appear\r\nuntil about five or six months after birth. With sheep, goats, and\r\ncattle, in which the horns are well developed in both sexes, though not\r\nquite equal in size, they can be felt, or even seen, at birth or soon\r\nafterwards.[361] Our rule, however, fails in regard to some breeds of\r\nsheep, for instance merinos, in which the rams alone are horned; for I\r\ncannot find on enquiry,[362] that the horns are developed later in life\r\nin this breed than in ordinary sheep in which both sexes are horned. But\r\nwith domesticated sheep the presence or absence of horns is not a firmly\r\nfixed character; a certain proportion of the merino ewes bearing small\r\nhorns, and some of the rams being hornless; whilst with ordinary sheep\r\nhornless ewes are occasionally produced.\r\n\r\nIn most of the species of the splendid family of the Pheasants, the\r\nmales differ conspicuously from the females, and they acquire their\r\nornaments at a rather late period of life. The eared pheasant\r\n(_Crossoptilon auritum_), however, offers a remarkable exception, for\r\nboth sexes possess the fine caudal plumes, the large ear-tufts and the\r\ncrimson velvet about the head; and I find on enquiry in the Zoological\r\nGardens that all these characters, in accordance with our rule, appear\r\nvery early in life. The adult male can, however, be distinguished from\r\nthe adult female by one character, namely by the presence of spurs; and\r\nconformably with our rule, these do not begin to be developed, as I am\r\nassured by Mr. Bartlett, before the age of six months, and even at this\r\nage, can hardly be distinguished in the two sexes.[363] The male and\r\nfemale Peacock differ conspicuously from each other in almost every\r\npart of their plumage, except in the elegant head-crest, which is common\r\nto both sexes; and this is developed very early in life, long before the\r\nother ornaments which are confined to the male. The wild-duck offers an\r\nanalogous case, for the beautiful green speculum on the wings is common\r\nto both sexes, though duller and somewhat smaller in the female, and it\r\nis developed early in life, whilst the curled tail-feathers and other\r\nornaments peculiar to the male are developed later.[364] Between such\r\nextreme cases of close sexual resemblance and wide dissimilarity, as\r\nthose of the Crossoptilon and peacock, many intermediate ones could be\r\ngiven, in which the characters follow in their order of development our\r\ntwo rules.\r\n\r\nAs most insects emerge from their pupal state in a mature condition, it\r\nis doubtful whether the period of development determines the\r\ntransference of their characters to one or both sexes. But we do not\r\nknow that the coloured scales, for instance, in two species of\r\nbutterflies, in one of which the sexes differ in colour, whilst in the\r\nother they are alike, are developed at the same relative age in the\r\ncocoon. Nor do we know whether all the scales are simultaneously\r\ndeveloped on the wings of the same species of butterfly, in which\r\ncertain coloured marks are confined to one sex, whilst other marks are\r\ncommon to both sexes. A difference of this kind in the period of\r\ndevelopment is not so improbable as it may at first appear; for with the\r\nOrthoptera, which assume their adult state, not by a single\r\nmetamorphosis, but by a succession of moults, the young males of some\r\nspecies at first resemble the females, and acquire their distinctive\r\nmasculine characters only during a later moult. Strictly analogous cases\r\noccur during the successive moults of certain male crustaceans.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet only considered the transference of characters,\r\nrelatively to their period of development, with species in a natural\r\nstate; we will now turn to domesticated animals; first touching on\r\nmonstrosities and diseases. The presence of supernumerary digits, and\r\nthe absence of certain phalanges, must be determined at an early\r\nembryonic period--the tendency to profuse bleeding is at least\r\ncongenital, as is probably colour-blindness--yet these peculiarities,\r\nand other similar ones, are often limited in their transmission to one\r\nsex; so that the rule that characters which are developed at an early\r\nperiod tend to be transmitted to both sexes, here wholly fails. But this\r\nrule, as before remarked, does not appear to be nearly so generally true\r\nas the converse proposition, namely, that characters which appear late\r\nin life in one sex are transmitted exclusively to the same sex. From the\r\nfact of the above abnormal peculiarities becoming attached to one sex,\r\nlong before the sexual functions are active, we may infer that there\r\nmust be a difference of some kind between the sexes at an extremely\r\nearly age. With respect to sexually-limited diseases, we know too little\r\nof the period at which they originate, to draw any fair conclusion.\r\nGout, however, seems to fall under our rule; for it is generally caused\r\nby intemperance after early youth, and is transmitted from the father to\r\nhis sons in a much more marked manner than to his daughters.\r\n\r\nIn the various domestic breeds of sheep, goats, and cattle, the males\r\ndiffer from their respective females in the shape or development of\r\ntheir horns, forehead, mane, dewlap, tail, and hump on the shoulders;\r\nand these peculiarities, in accordance with our rule, are not fully\r\ndeveloped until rather late in life. With dogs, the sexes do not differ,\r\nexcept that in certain breeds, especially in the Scotch deer-hound, the\r\nmale is much larger and heavier than the female; and as we shall see in\r\na future chapter, the male goes on increasing in size to an unusually\r\nlate period of life, which will account, according to our rule, for his\r\nincreased size being transmitted to his male offspring alone. On the\r\nother hand, the tortoise-shell colour of the hair, which is confined to\r\nfemale cats, is quite distinct at birth, and this case violates our\r\nrule. There is a breed of pigeons in which the males alone are streaked\r\nwith black, and the streaks can be detected even in the nestlings; but\r\nthey become more conspicuous at each successive moult, so that this case\r\npartly opposes and partly supports the rule. With the English Carrier\r\nand Pouter pigeon the full development of the wattle and the crop occurs\r\nrather late in life, and these characters, conformably with our rule,\r\nare transmitted in full perfection to the males alone. The following\r\ncases perhaps come within the class previously alluded to, in which the\r\ntwo sexes have varied in the same manner at a rather late period of\r\nlife, and have consequently transferred their new characters to both\r\nsexes at a corresponding late period; and if so, such cases are not\r\nopposed to our rule. Thus there are sub-breeds of the pigeon, described\r\nby Neumeister,[365] both sexes of which change colour after moulting\r\ntwice or thrice, as does likewise the Almond Tumbler; nevertheless these\r\nchanges, though occurring rather late in life, are common to both sexes.\r\nOne variety of the Canary-bird, namely the London Prize, offers a nearly\r\nanalogous case.\r\n\r\nWith the breeds of the Fowl the inheritance of various characters by one\r\nsex or by both sexes, seems generally determined by the period at which\r\nsuch characters are developed. Thus in all the many breeds in which the\r\nadult male differs greatly in colour from the female and from the adult\r\nmale parent-species, he differs from the young male, so that the newly\r\nacquired characters must have appeared at a rather late period of life.\r\nOn the other hand with most of the breeds in which the two sexes\r\nresemble each other, the young are coloured in nearly the same manner as\r\ntheir parents, and this renders it probable that their colours first\r\nappeared early in life. We have instances of this fact in all black and\r\nwhite breeds, in which the young and old of both sexes are alike; nor\r\ncan it be maintained that there is something peculiar in a black or\r\nwhite plumage, leading to its transference to both sexes; for the males\r\nalone of many natural species are either black or white, the females\r\nbeing very differently coloured. With the so-called Cuckoo sub-breeds of\r\nthe fowl, in which the feathers are transversely pencilled with dark\r\nstripes, both sexes and the chickens are coloured in nearly the same\r\nmanner. The laced plumage of the Sebright bantam is the same in both\r\nsexes, and in the chickens the feathers are tipped with black, which\r\nmakes a near approach to lacing. Spangled Hamburghs, however, offer a\r\npartial exception, for the two sexes, though not quite alike, resemble\r\neach other more closely than do the sexes of the aboriginal\r\nparent-species, yet they acquire their characteristic plumage late in\r\nlife, for the chickens are distinctly pencilled. Turning to other\r\ncharacters besides colour: the males alone of the wild parent-species\r\nand of most domestic breeds possess a fairly well developed comb, but in\r\nthe young of the Spanish fowl it is largely developed at a very early\r\nage, and apparently in consequence of this it is of unusual size in the\r\nadult females. In the Game breeds pugnacity is developed at a\r\nwonderfully early age, of which curious proofs could be given; and this\r\ncharacter is transmitted to both sexes, so that the hens, from their\r\nextreme pugnacity, are now generally exhibited in separate pens. With\r\nthe Polish breeds the bony protuberance of the skull which supports the\r\ncrest is partially developed even before the chickens are hatched, and\r\nthe crest itself soon begins to grow, though at first feebly;[366] and\r\nin this breed a great bony protuberance and an immense crest\r\ncharacterise the adults of both sexes.\r\n\r\nFinally, from what we have now seen of the relation which exists in many\r\nnatural species and domesticated races, between the period of the\r\ndevelopment of their characters and the manner of their\r\ntransmission--for example the striking fact of the early growth of the\r\nhorns in the reindeer, in which both sexes have horns, in comparison\r\nwith their much later growth in the other species in which the male\r\nalone bears horns--we may conclude that one cause, though not the sole\r\ncause, of characters being exclusively inherited by one sex, is their\r\ndevelopment at a late age. And secondly, that one, though apparently a\r\nless efficient, cause of characters being inherited by both sexes is\r\ntheir development at an early age, whilst the sexes differ but little in\r\nconstitution. It appears, however, that some difference must exist\r\nbetween the sexes even during an early embryonic period, for characters\r\ndeveloped at this age not rarely become attached to one sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary and concluding remarks._--From the foregoing discussion on the\r\nvarious laws of inheritance, we learn that characters often or even\r\ngenerally tend to become developed in the same sex, at the same age, and\r\nperiodically at the same season of the year, in which they first\r\nappeared in the parents. But these laws, from unknown causes, are very\r\nliable to change. Hence the successive steps in the modification of a\r\nspecies might readily be transmitted in different ways; some of the\r\nsteps being transmitted to one sex, and some to both; some to the\r\noffspring at one age, and some at all ages. Not only are the laws of\r\ninheritance extremely complex, but so are the causes which induce and\r\ngovern variability. The variations thus caused are preserved and\r\naccumulated by sexual selection, which is in itself an extremely complex\r\naffair, depending, as it does, on ardour in love, courage, and the\r\nrivalry of the males, and on the powers of perception, taste, and will\r\nof the female. Sexual selection will also be dominated by natural\r\nselection for the general welfare of the species. Hence the manner in\r\nwhich the individuals of either sex or of both sexes are affected\r\nthrough sexual selection cannot fail to be complex in the highest\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nWhen variations occur late in life in one sex, and are transmitted to\r\nthe same sex at the same age, the other sex and the young are\r\nnecessarily left unmodified. When they occur late in life, but are\r\ntransmitted to both sexes at the same age, the young alone are left\r\nunmodified. Variations, however, may occur at any period of life in one\r\nsex or in both, and be transmitted to both sexes at all ages, and then\r\nall the individuals of the species will be similarly modified. In the\r\nfollowing chapters it will be seen that all these cases frequently occur\r\nunder nature.\r\n\r\nSexual selection can never act on any animal whilst young, before the\r\nage for reproduction has arrived. From the great eagerness of the male\r\nit has generally acted on this sex and not on the females. The males\r\nhave thus become provided with weapons for fighting with their rivals,\r\nor with organs for discovering and securely holding the female, or for\r\nexciting and charming her. When the sexes differ in these respects, it\r\nis also, as we have seen, an extremely general law that the adult male\r\ndiffers more or less from the young male; and we may conclude from this\r\nfact that the successive variations, by which the adult male became\r\nmodified, cannot have occurred much before the age for reproduction. How\r\nthen are we to account for this general and remarkable coincidence\r\nbetween the period of variability and that of sexual selection,--\r\nprinciples which are quite independent of each other? I\r\nthink we can see the cause: it is not that the males have never varied\r\nat an early age, but that such variations have commonly been lost,\r\nwhilst those occurring at a later age have been preserved.\r\n\r\nAll animals produce more offspring than can survive to maturity; and we\r\nhave every reason to believe that death falls heavily on the weak and\r\ninexperienced young. If then a certain proportion of the offspring were\r\nto vary at birth or soon afterwards, in some manner which at this age\r\nwas of no service to them, the chance of the preservation of such\r\nvariations would be small. We have good evidence under domestication how\r\nsoon variations of all kinds are lost, if not selected. But variations\r\nwhich occurred at or near maturity, and which were of immediate service\r\nto either sex, would probably be preserved; as would similar variations\r\noccurring at an earlier period in any individuals which happened to\r\nsurvive. As this principle has an important bearing on sexual selection,\r\nit may be advisable to give an imaginary illustration. We will take a\r\npair of animals, neither very fertile nor the reverse, and assume that\r\nafter arriving at maturity they live on an average for five years,\r\nproducing each year five young. They would thus produce 25 offspring;\r\nand it would not, I think, be an unfair estimate to assume that 18 or 20\r\nout of the 25 would perish before maturity, whilst still young and\r\ninexperienced; the remaining seven or five sufficing to keep up the\r\nstock of mature individuals. If so, we can see that variations which\r\noccurred during youth, for instance in brightness, and which were not of\r\nthe least service to the young, would run a good chance of being utterly\r\nlost. Whilst similar variations, which occurring at or near maturity in\r\nthe comparatively few individuals surviving to this age, and which\r\nimmediately gave an advantage to certain males, by rendering them more\r\nattractive to the females, would be likely to be preserved. No doubt\r\nsome of the variations in brightness which occurred at an earlier age\r\nwould by chance be preserved, and eventually give to the male the same\r\nadvantage as those which appeared later; and this will account for the\r\nyoung males commonly partaking to a certain extent (as may be observed\r\nwith many birds) of the bright colours of their adult male parents. If\r\nonly a few of the successive variations in brightness were to occur at a\r\nlate age, the adult male would be only a little brighter than the young\r\nmale; and such cases are common.\r\n\r\nIn this illustration I have assumed that the young varied in a manner\r\nwhich was of no service to them; but many characters proper to the adult\r\nmale would be actually injurious to the young,--as bright colours from\r\nmaking them conspicuous, or horns of large size from expending much\r\nvital force. Such variations in the young would promptly be eliminated\r\nthrough natural selection. With the adult and experienced males, on the\r\nother hand, the advantage thus derived in their rivalry with other males\r\nwould often more than counterbalance exposure to some degree of danger.\r\nThus we can understand how it is that variations which must originally\r\nhave appeared rather late in life have alone or in chief part been\r\npreserved for the development of secondary sexual characters; and the\r\nremarkable coincidence between the periods of variability and of sexual\r\nselection is intelligible.\r\n\r\nAs variations which give to the male an advantage in lighting with other\r\nmales, or in finding, securing, or charming the female, would be of no\r\nuse to the female, they will not have been preserved in this sex either\r\nduring youth or maturity. Consequently such variations would be\r\nextremely liable to be lost; and the female, as far as these characters\r\nare concerned, would be left unmodified, excepting in so far as she may\r\nhave received them by transference from the male. No doubt if the female\r\nvaried and transferred serviceable characters to her male offspring,\r\nthese would be favoured through sexual selection; and then both sexes\r\nwould thus far be modified in the same manner. But I shall hereafter\r\nhave to recur to these more intricate contingencies.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters, I shall treat of the secondary sexual\r\ncharacters in animals of all classes, and shall endeavour in each case\r\nto apply the principles explained in the present chapter. The lowest\r\nclasses will detain us for a very short time, but the higher animals,\r\nespecially birds, must be treated at considerable length. It should be\r\nborne in mind that for reasons already assigned, I intend to give only a\r\nfew illustrative instances of the innumerable structures by the aid of\r\nwhich the male finds the female, or, when found, holds her. On the other\r\nhand, all structures and instincts by which the male conquers other\r\nmales, and by which he allures or excites the female, will be fully\r\ndiscussed, as these are in many ways the most interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supplement on the proportional numbers of the two sexes in animals\r\nbelonging to various classes._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs no one, as far as I can discover, has paid attention to the relative\r\nnumbers of the two sexes throughout the animal kingdom, I will here give\r\nsuch materials as I have been able to collect, although they are\r\nextremely imperfect. They consist in only a few instances of actual\r\nenumeration, and the numbers are not very large. As the proportions are\r\nknown with certainty on a large scale in the case of man alone, I will\r\nfirst give them, as a standard of comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Man._--In England during ten years (from 1857 to 1866) 707,120 children\r\non an annual average have been born alive, in the proportion of 104.5\r\nmales to 100 females. But in 1857 the male births throughout England\r\nwere as 105.2, and in 1865 as 104.0 to 100. Looking to separate\r\ndistricts, in Buckinghamshire (where on an average 5000 children are\r\nannually born) the _mean_ proportion of male to female births, during\r\nthe whole period of the above ten years, was as 102.8 to 100; whilst in\r\nN. Wales (where the average annual births are 12,873) it was as high as\r\n106.2 to 100. Taking a still smaller district, viz., Rutlandshire (where\r\nthe annual births average only 739), in 1864 the male births were as\r\n114.6, and in 1862 as 97.0 to 100; but even in this small district the\r\naverage of the 7385 births during the whole ten years was as 104.5 to\r\n100; that is in the same ratio as throughout England.[367] The\r\nproportions are sometimes slightly disturbed by unknown causes; thus\r\nProf. Faye states \"that in some districts of Norway there has been\r\nduring a decennial period a steady deficiency of boys, whilst in others\r\nthe opposite condition has existed.\" In France during forty-four years\r\nthe male to the female births have been as 106.2 to 100; but during this\r\nperiod it has occurred five times in one department, and six times in\r\nanother, that the female births have exceeded the males. In Russia the\r\naverage proportion is as high as 108.9 to 100.[368] It is a singular\r\nfact that with Jews the proportion of male births is decidedly larger\r\nthan with Christians: thus in Prussia the proportion is as 113, in\r\nBreslau as 114, and in Livonia as 120 to 100; the Christian births in\r\nthese countries being the same as usual, for instance, in Livonia as 104\r\nto 100.[369] It is a still more singular fact that in different nations,\r\nunder different conditions and climates, in Naples, Prussia, Westphalia,\r\nFrance and England, the excess of male over female births is less when\r\nthey are illegitimate than when legitimate.[370]\r\n\r\nIn various parts of Europe, according to Prof. Faye and other authors,\r\n\"a still greater preponderance of males would be met with, if death\r\nstruck both sexes in equal proportion in the womb and during birth. But\r\nthe fact is, that for every 100 still-born females, we have in several\r\ncountries from 134.6 to 144.9 still-born males.\" Moreover during the\r\nfirst four or five years of life more male children die than females;\r\n\"for example in England, during the first year, 126 boys die\r\nfor every 100 girls,--a proportion which in France is still more\r\nunfavourable.\"[371] As a consequence of this excess in the death-rate of\r\nmale children, and of the exposure of men when adult to various dangers,\r\nand of their tendency to emigrate, the females in all old-settled\r\ncountries, where statistical records have been kept,[372] are found to\r\npreponderate considerably over the males.\r\n\r\nIt has often been supposed that the relative ages of the parents\r\ndetermine the sex of the offspring; and Prof. Leuckart[373] has advanced\r\nwhat he considers sufficient evidence, with respect to man and certain\r\ndomesticated animals, to shew that this is one important factor in the\r\nresult. So again the period of impregnation has been thought to be the\r\nefficient cause; but recent observations discountenance this belief.\r\nAgain, with mankind polygamy has been supposed to lead to the birth of a\r\ngreater proportion of female infants; but Dr. J. Campbell[374] carefully\r\nattended to this subject in the harems of Siam, and he concludes that\r\nthe proportion of male to female births is the same as from monogamous\r\nunions. Hardly any animal has been rendered so highly polygamous as our\r\nEnglish race-horses, and we shall immediately see that their male and\r\nfemale offspring are almost exactly equal in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Horses._--Mr. Tegetmeier has been so kind as to tabulate for\r\n  me from the 'Racing Calendar' the births of race-horses during\r\n  a period of twenty-one years, viz. from 1846 to 1867; 1849\r\n  being omitted, as no returns were that year published. The\r\n  total births have been 25,560,[375] consisting of 12,763 males\r\n  and 12,797 females, or in the proportion of 99.7 males to 100\r\n  females. As these numbers are tolerably large, and as they are\r\n  drawn from all parts of England, during several years, we may\r\n  with much confidence conclude that with the domestic horse, or\r\n  at least with the race-horse, the two sexes are produced in\r\n  almost equal numbers. The fluctuations in the proportions\r\n  during successive years are closely like those which occur with\r\n  mankind, when a small and thinly-populated area is considered:\r\n  thus in 1856 the male horses were as 107.1, and in 1867 as only\r\n  92.6 to 100 females. In the tabulated returns the proportions\r\n  vary in cycles, for the males exceeded the females during six\r\n  successive years; and the females exceeded the males during two\r\n  periods each of four years: this, however, may be accidental;\r\n  at least I can detect nothing of the kind with man in the\r\n  decennial table in the Registrar's Report for 1866. I may add\r\n  that certain, mares, and this holds good with certain cows and\r\n  with women, tend to produce more of one sex than of the other;\r\n  Mr. Wright of Yeldersley House, informs me that one of his Arab\r\n  mares, though put seven times to different horses, produced\r\n  seven fillies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Dogs._--During a period of twelve years, from 1857 to 1868,\r\n  the births of a large number of greyhounds, throughout England,\r\n  have been sent to the 'Field' newspaper; and I am again\r\n  indebted to Mr. Tegetmeier for carefully tabulating the\r\n  results. The recorded, births have been 6878, consisting of\r\n  3605 males and 3273 females, that is, in the proportion of\r\n  110.1 males to 100 females. The greatest fluctuations occurred\r\n  in 1864, when the proportion was as 95.3 males, and in 1867, as\r\n  116.3 males to 100 females. The above average proportion of\r\n  110.1 to 100 is probably nearly correct in the case of the\r\n  greyhound, but whether it would hold with other domesticated\r\n  breeds is in some degree doubtful. Mr. Cupples has enquired\r\n  from several great breeders of dogs, and finds that all without\r\n  exception believe that females are produced in excess; he\r\n  suggests that this belief may have arisen from females being\r\n  less valued and the consequent disappointment producing a\r\n  stronger impression on the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Sheep._--The sexes of sheep are not ascertained by\r\n  agriculturists until several months after birth, at the period\r\n  when the males are castrated; so that the following returns do\r\n  not give the proportions at birth. Moreover, I find that\r\n  several great breeders in Scotland, who annually raise some\r\n  thousand sheep, are firmly convinced that a larger proportion\r\n  of males than of females die during the first one or two years;\r\n  therefore the proportion of males would be somewhat greater at\r\n  birth than at the age of castration. This is a remarkable\r\n  coincidence with what occurs, as we have seen, with mankind,\r\n  and both cases probably depend on some common cause. I have\r\n  received returns from four gentlemen in England who have bred\r\n  lowland sheep, chiefly Leicesters, during the last ten or\r\n  sixteen years; they amount altogether to 8965 births,\r\n  consisting of 4407 males and 4558 females; that is in the\r\n  proportion of 96.7 males to 100 females. With respect to\r\n  Cheviot and black-faced sheep bred in Scotland, I have received\r\n  returns from six breeders, two of them on a large scale,\r\n  chiefly for the years 1867-1869, but some of the returns\r\n  extending back to 1862. The total number recorded amounts to\r\n  50,685, consisting of 25,071 males and 25,614 females, or in\r\n  the proportion of 97.9 males to 100 females. If we take the\r\n  English and Scotch returns together, the total number amounts\r\n  to 59,650, consisting of 29,478 males and 30,172 females, or\r\n  as 97.7 to 100. So that with sheep at the age of castration the\r\n  females are certainly in excess of the males; but whether this\r\n  would hold good at birth is doubtful, owing to the greater\r\n  liability in the males to early death.[376]\r\n\r\n  Of _Cattle_ I have received returns from nine gentlemen of 982\r\n  births, too few to be trusted; these consisted of 477\r\n  bull-calves and 505 cow-calves; _i.e._ in the proportion of\r\n  94.4 males to 100 females. The Rev. W. D. Fox informs me that\r\n  in 1867 out of 34 calves born on a farm in Derbyshire only one\r\n  was a bull. Mr. Harrison Weir writes to me that he has enquired\r\n  from several breeders of _Pigs_, and most of them estimate the\r\n  male to the female births as about 7 to 6. This same gentleman\r\n  has bred _Rabbits_ for many years, and has noticed that a far\r\n  greater number of bucks are produced than does.\r\n\r\n  Of mammalia in a state of nature I have been able to learn very\r\n  little. In regard to the common rat, I have received\r\n  conflicting statements. Mr. R. Elliot of Laighwood, informs me\r\n  that a rat-catcher assured him that he had always found the\r\n  males in great excess, even with the young in the nest. In\r\n  consequence of this, Mr. Elliot himself subsequently examined\r\n  some hundred old ones, and found the statement true. Mr. F.\r\n  Buckland has bred a large number of white rats, and he also\r\n  believes that the males greatly exceed the females. In regard\r\n  to Moles, it is said that \"the males are much more numerous\r\n  than the females;\"[377] and as the catching of these animals is\r\n  a special occupation, the statement may perhaps be trusted. Sir\r\n  A. Smith, in describing an antelope of S. Africa[378] (_Kobus\r\n  ellipsiprymnus_), remarks, that in the herds of this and other\r\n  species, the males are few in number compared with the females:\r\n  the natives believe that they are born in this proportion;\r\n  others believe that the younger males are expelled from the\r\n  herds, and Sir A. Smith says, that though he has himself never\r\n  seen herds consisting of young males alone, others affirm that\r\n  this does occur. It appears probable that the young males when\r\n  expelled from the herd, would be likely to fell a prey to the\r\n  many beasts of prey of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BIRDS.\r\n\r\n  With respect to the _Fowl_, I have received only one account,\r\n  namely, that out of 1001 chickens of a highly-bred stock of\r\n  Cochins, reared during eight years by Mr. Stretch, 487 proved\r\n  males and 514 females: _i.e._ as 94.7 to 100. In regard to\r\n  domestic pigeons there is good evidence that the males are\r\n  produced in excess, or that their lives are longer; for these\r\n  birds invariably pair, and single males, as Mr. Tegetmeier\r\n  informs me, can always be purchased cheaper than females.\r\n  Usually the two birds reared from the two eggs laid in the same\r\n  nest consist of a male and female; but Mr. Harrison Weir, who\r\n  has been so large a breeder, says that he has often bred two\r\n  cocks from the same nest, and seldom two hens; moreover the hen\r\n  is generally the weaker of the two, and more liable to perish.\r\n\r\n  With respect to birds in a state of nature, Mr. Gould and\r\n  others[379] are convinced that the males are generally the more\r\n  numerous; and as the young males of many species resemble the\r\n  females, the latter would naturally appear to be the most\r\n  numerous. Large numbers of pheasants are reared by Mr. Baker of\r\n  Leadenhall from eggs laid by wild birds, and he informs Mr.\r\n  Jenner Weir that four or five males to one female are generally\r\n  produced. An experienced observer remarks[380] that in\r\n  Scandinavia the broods of the capercailzie and black-cock\r\n  contain more males than females; and that with the Dal-ripa (a\r\n  kind of ptarmigan) more males than females attend the _leks_ or\r\n  places of courtship; but this latter circumstance is accounted\r\n  for by some observers by a greater number of hen birds being\r\n  killed by vermin. From various facts given by White of\r\n  Selbourne,[381] it seems clear that the males of the partridge\r\n  must be in considerable excess in the south of England; and I\r\n  have been assured that this is the case in Scotland. Mr. Weir\r\n  on enquiring from the dealers who receive at certain seasons\r\n  large numbers of ruffs (_Machetes pugnax_) was told that the\r\n  males are much the most numerous. This same naturalist has also\r\n  enquired for me from the bird-catchers, who annually catch an\r\n  astonishing number of various small species alive for the\r\n  London market, and he was unhesitatingly answered by an old and\r\n  trustworthy man, that with the chaffinch the males are in large\r\n  excess; he thought as high as 2 males to 1 female, or at least\r\n  as high as 5 to 3.[382] The males of the blackbird, he likewise\r\n  maintained, were by far the most numerous, whether caught by\r\n  traps or by netting at night. These statements may apparently\r\n  be trusted, because the same man said that the sexes are about\r\n  equal with the lark, the twite (_Linaria montana_), and\r\n  goldfinch. On the other hand he is certain that with the common\r\n  linnet, the females preponderate greatly, but unequally during\r\n  different years; during some years he has found the females to\r\n  the males as four to one. It should, however, be borne in mind,\r\n  that the chief season for catching birds does not begin till\r\n  September, so that with some species partial migrations may\r\n  have begun, and the flocks at this period often consist of hens\r\n  alone. Mr. Salvin paid particular attention to the sexes of the\r\n  humming-birds in Central America, and he is convinced that with\r\n  most of the species the males are in excess; thus one year he\r\n  procured 204 specimens belonging to ten species, and these\r\n  consisted of 166 males and of 38 females. With two other\r\n  species the females were in excess: but the proportions\r\n  apparently vary either during different seasons or in different\r\n  localities; for on one occasion the males of _Campylopterus\r\n  hemileucurus_ were to the females as five to two, and on\r\n  another occasion[383] in exactly the reversed ratio. As bearing\r\n  on this latter point, I may add, that Mr. Powys found in Corfu\r\n  and Epirus the sexes of the chaffinch keeping apart, and \"the\r\n  females by far the most numerous;\" whilst in Palestine Mr.\r\n  Tristram found \"the male flocks appearing greatly to exceed the\r\n  female in number.\"[384] So again with the _Quiscalus major_,\r\n  Mr. G. Taylor[385] says, that in Florida there were \"very few\r\n  females in proportion to the males,\" whilst in Honduras the\r\n  proportion was the other way, the species there having the\r\n  character of a polygamist.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FISH.\r\n\r\n  With Fish the proportional numbers of the sexes can be\r\n  ascertained only by catching them in the adult or nearly adult\r\n  state; and there are many difficulties in arriving at any just\r\n  conclusion.[386] Infertile females might readily be mistaken\r\n  for males, as Dr. Guenther has remarked to me in regard to\r\n  trout. With some species the males are believed to die soon\r\n  after fertilising the ova. With many species the males are of\r\n  much smaller size than the females, so that a large number of\r\n  males would escape from the same net by which the females were\r\n  caught. M. Carbonnier,[387] who has especially attended to the\r\n  natural history of the pike (_Esox lucius_) states that many\r\n  males, owing to their small size, are devoured by the larger\r\n  females; and he believes that the males of almost all fish are\r\n  exposed from the same cause to greater danger than the females.\r\n  Nevertheless in the few cases in which the proportional numbers\r\n  have been actually observed, the males appear to be largely in\r\n  excess. Thus Mr. R. Buist, the superintendent of the\r\n  Stormontfield experiments, says that in 1865, out of 70 salmon\r\n  first landed for the purpose of obtaining the ova, upwards of\r\n  60 were males. In 1867 he again \"calls attention to the vast\r\n  disproportion of the males to the females. We had at the outset\r\n  at least ten males to one female.\" Afterwards sufficient\r\n  females for obtaining ova were procured. He adds, \"from the\r\n  great proportion of the males, they are constantly fighting and\r\n  tearing each other on the spawning-beds.\"[388] This\r\n  disproportion, no doubt, can be accounted for in part, but\r\n  whether wholly is very doubtful, by the males ascending the\r\n  rivers before the females. Mr. F. Buckland remarks in regard to\r\n  trout, that \"it is a curious fact that the males preponderate\r\n  very largely in number over the females. It _invariably_\r\n  happens that when the first rush of fish is made to the net,\r\n  there will be at least seven or eight males to one female found\r\n  captive. I cannot quite account for this; either the males are\r\n  more numerous than the females, or the latter seek safety by\r\n  concealment rather than flight.\" He then adds, that by\r\n  carefully searching the banks, sufficient females for obtaining\r\n  ova can be found.[389] Mr. H. Lee informs me that out of 212\r\n  trout, taken for this purpose in Lord Portsmouth's park, 150\r\n  were males and 62 females.\r\n\r\n  With the Cyprinidae the males likewise seem to be in excess; but\r\n  several members of this Family, viz., the carp, tench, bream\r\n  and minnow, appear regularly to follow the practice, rare in\r\n  the animal kingdom, of polyandry; for the female whilst\r\n  spawning is always attended by two males, one on each side, and\r\n  in the case of the bream by three or four males. This fact is\r\n  so well known, that it is always recommended to stock a pond\r\n  with two male tenches to one female, or at least with three\r\n  males to two females. With the minnow, an excellent observer\r\n  states, that on the spawning-beds the males are ten times as\r\n  numerous as the females; when a female comes amongst the males,\r\n  \"she is immediately pressed closely by a male on each side; and\r\n  when they have been in that situation for a time, are\r\n  superseded by other two males.\"[390]\r\n\r\n\r\n  INSECTS.\r\n\r\n  In this class, the Lepidoptera alone afford the means of\r\n  judging of the proportional numbers of the sexes; for they have\r\n  been collected with special care by many good observers, and\r\n  have been largely bred from the egg or caterpillar state. I had\r\n  hoped that some breeders of silk-moths might have kept an exact\r\n  record, but after writing to France and Italy, and consulting\r\n  various treatises, I cannot find that this has ever been done.\r\n  The general opinion appears to be that the sexes are nearly\r\n  equal, but in Italy as I hear from Professor Canestrini, many\r\n  breeders are convinced that the females are produced in excess.\r\n  The same naturalist, however, informs me, that in the two\r\n  yearly broods of the Ailanthus silk-moth (_Bombyx cynthia_),\r\n  the males greatly preponderate in the first, whilst in the\r\n  second the two sexes are nearly equal, or the females rather in\r\n  excess.\r\n\r\n  In regard to Butterflies in a state of nature, several\r\n  observers have been much struck by the apparently enormous\r\n  preponderance of the males.[391] Thus Mr. Bates,[392] in\r\n  speaking of the species, no less than about a hundred in\r\n  number, which inhabit the Upper Amazons, says that the males\r\n  are much more numerous than the females, even in the proportion\r\n  of a hundred to one. In North America, Edwards, who had great\r\n  experience, estimates in the genus Papilio the males to the\r\n  females as four to one; and Mr. Walsh, who informed me of this\r\n  statement, says that with _P. turnus_ this is certainly the\r\n  case. In South Africa, Mr. R. Trimen found the males in excess\r\n  in 19 species;[393] and in one of these, which swarms in open\r\n  places, he estimated the number of males as fifty to one\r\n  female. With another species, in which the males are numerous\r\n  in certain localities, he collected during seven years only\r\n  five females. In the island of Bourbon, M. Maillard states that\r\n  the males of one species of Papilio are twenty times as\r\n  numerous as the females.[394] Mr. Trimen informs me that as far\r\n  as he has himself seen, or heard from others, it is rare for\r\n  the females of any butterfly to exceed in number the males; but\r\n  this is perhaps the case with three South African species. Mr.\r\n  Wallace[395] states that the females of _Ornithoptera\r\n  croesus_, in the Malay archipelago, are more common and more\r\n  easily caught than the males; but this is a rare butterfly. I\r\n  may here add, that in Hyperythra, a genus of moths, Guenee\r\n  says, that from four to five females are sent in collections\r\n  from India for one male.\r\n\r\n  When this subject of the proportional numbers of the sexes of\r\n  insects was brought before the Entomological Society,[396] it\r\n  was generally admitted that the males of most Lepidoptera, in\r\n  the adult or imago state, are caught in greater numbers than\r\n  the females; but this fact was attributed by various observers\r\n  to the more retiring habits of the females, and to the males\r\n  emerging earlier from the cocoon. This latter circumstance is\r\n  well known to occur with most Lepidoptera, as well as with\r\n  other insects. So that, as M. Personnat remarks, the males of\r\n  the domesticated _Bombyx yamamai_, are lost at the beginning of\r\n  the season, and the females at the end, from the want of\r\n  mates.[397] I cannot however persuade myself that these causes\r\n  suffice to explain the great excess of males in the cases,\r\n  above given, of butterflies which are extremely common in their\r\n  native countries. Mr. Stainton, who has paid such close\r\n  attention during many years to the smaller moths, informs me\r\n  that when he collected them in the imago state, he thought that\r\n  the males were ten times as numerous as the females, but that\r\n  since he has reared them on a large scale from the caterpillar\r\n  state, he is convinced that the females are the most numerous.\r\n  Several entomologists concur in this view. Mr. Doubleday,\r\n  however, and some others, take an opposite view, and are\r\n  convinced that they have reared from the egg and caterpillar\r\n  states a larger proportion of males than of females.\r\n\r\n  Besides the more active habits of the males, their earlier\r\n  emergence from the cocoon, and their frequenting in some cases\r\n  more open stations, other causes may be assigned for an\r\n  apparent or real difference in the proportional numbers of the\r\n  sexes of Lepidoptera, when captured in the imago state, and\r\n  when reared from the egg or caterpillar state. It is believed\r\n  by many breeders in Italy, as I hear from Professor Canestrini,\r\n  that the female caterpillar of the silk-moth suffers more from\r\n  the recent disease than the male; and Dr. Staudinger informs me\r\n  that in rearing Lepidoptera more females die in the cocoon than\r\n  males. With many species the female caterpillar is larger than\r\n  the male, and a collector would naturally choose the finest\r\n  specimens, and thus unintentionally collect a larger number of\r\n  females. Three collectors have told me that this was their\r\n  practice; but Dr. Wallace is sure that most collectors take all\r\n  the specimens which they can find of the rarer kinds, which\r\n  alone are worth the trouble of rearing. Birds when surrounded\r\n  by caterpillars would probably devour the largest; and\r\n  Professor Canestrini informs me that in Italy some breeders\r\n  believe, though on insufficient evidence, that in the first\r\n  brood of the Ailanthus silk-moth, the wasps destroy a larger\r\n  number of the female than of the male caterpillars. Dr. Wallace\r\n  further remarks that female caterpillars, from being larger\r\n  than the males, require more time for their development and\r\n  consume more food and moisture; and thus they would be exposed\r\n  during a longer time to danger from ichneumons, birds, &c., and\r\n  in times of scarcity would perish in greater numbers. Hence it\r\n  appears quite possible that, in a state of nature, fewer female\r\n  Lepidoptera may reach maturity than males; and for our special\r\n  object we are concerned with the numbers at maturity, when the\r\n  sexes are ready to propagate their kind.\r\n\r\n  The manner in which the males of certain moths congregate in\r\n  extraordinary numbers round a single female, apparently\r\n  indicates a great excess of males, though this fact may perhaps\r\n  be accounted for by the earlier emergence of the males from\r\n  their cocoons. Mr. Stainton informs me that from twelve to\r\n  twenty males may often be seen congregated round a female\r\n  _Elachista rufocinerea_. It is well known that if a virgin\r\n  _Lasiocampa quercus_ or _Saturnia carpini_ be exposed in a\r\n  cage, vast numbers of males collect round her, and if confined\r\n  in a room will even come down the chimney to her. Mr.\r\n  Doubleday believes that he has seen from fifty to a hundred\r\n  males of both these species attracted in the course of a single\r\n  day by a female under confinement. Mr. Trimen exposed in the\r\n  Isle of Wight a box in which a female of the Lasiocampa had\r\n  been confined on the previous day, and five males soon\r\n  endeavoured to gain admittance. M. Verreaux, in Australia,\r\n  having placed the female of a small Bombyx in a box in his\r\n  pocket, was followed by a crowd of males, so that about 200\r\n  entered the house with him.[398]\r\n\r\n  Mr. Doubleday has called my attention to Dr. Staudinger's[399]\r\n  list of Lepidoptera, which gives the prices of the males and\r\n  females of 300 species or well-marked varieties of\r\n  (Rhopalocera) butterflies. The prices for both sexes of the\r\n  very common species are of course the same; but with 114 of the\r\n  rarer species they differ; the males being in all cases,\r\n  excepting one, the cheapest. On an average of the prices of the\r\n  113 species, the price of the male to that of the female is as\r\n  100 to 149; and this apparently indicates that inversely the\r\n  males exceed the females in number in the same proportion.\r\n  About 2000 species or varieties of moths (Heterocera) are\r\n  catalogued, those with wingless females being here excluded on\r\n  account of the difference in habits of the two sexes: of these\r\n  2000 species, 141 differ in price according to sex, the males\r\n  of 130 being cheaper, and the males of only 11 being dearer\r\n  than the females. The average price of the males of the 130\r\n  species, to that of the females, is as 100 to 143. With respect\r\n  to the butterflies in this priced list, Mr. Doubleday thinks\r\n  (and no man in England has had more experience), that there is\r\n  nothing in the habits of the species which can account for the\r\n  difference in the prices of the two sexes, and that it can be\r\n  accounted for only by an excess in the numbers of the males.\r\n  But I am bound to add that Dr. Staudinger himself, as he\r\n  informs me, is of a different opinion. He thinks that the less\r\n  active habits of the females and the earlier emergence of the\r\n  males will account for his collectors securing a larger number\r\n  of males than of females, and consequently for the lower prices\r\n  of the former With respect to specimens reared from the\r\n  caterpillar-state, Dr. Staudinger believes, as previously\r\n  stated, that a greater number of females than of males die\r\n  under confinement in the cocoons. He adds that with certain\r\n  species one sex seems to preponderate over the other during\r\n  certain years.\r\n\r\n  Of direct observations on the sexes of Lepidoptera, reared\r\n  either from eggs or caterpillars, I have received only the few\r\n  following cases:--\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                                    Males. | Females.\r\n  The Rev. J.

Taken together the proportion of males is\r\n  as 122.7 to 100 females. But the numbers are hardly large\r\n  enough to be trustworthy.\r\n\r\n  On the whole, from the above various sources of evidence, all\r\n  pointing to the same direction, I infer that with most species\r\n  of Lepidoptera, the males in the imago state generally exceed\r\n  the females in number, whatever the proportions may be at their\r\n  first emergence from the egg.\r\n\r\n  With reference to the other Orders of insects, I have been able\r\n  to collect very little reliable information. With the\r\n  stag-beetle (_Lucanus cervus_) \"the males appear to be much\r\n  more numerous than the females;\" but when, as Cornelius\r\n  remarked during 1867, an unusual number of these beetles\r\n  appeared in one part of Germany, the females appeared to exceed\r\n  the males as six so one. With one of the Elateridae, the males\r\n  are said to be much more numerous than the females, and \"two or\r\n  three are often found united with one female;\"[401] so that here\r\n  polyandry seems to prevail. With Siagonium (Staphylinidae), in\r\n  which the males are furnished with horns, \"the females are far\r\n  more numerous than the opposite sex.\" Mr. Janson stated at the\r\n  Entomological Society that the females of the bark-feeding\r\n  _Tomicus villosus_ are so common as to be a plague, whilst the\r\n  males are so rare as to be hardly known. In other Orders, from\r\n  unknown causes, but apparently in some instances owing to\r\n  parthenogenesis, the males of certain species have never been\r\n  discovered or are excessively rare, as with several of the\r\n  Cynipidae.[402] In all the gall-making Cynipidae known to Mr.\r\n  Walsh, the females are four or five times as numerous as the\r\n  males; and so it is, as he informs me, with the gall-making\r\n  Cecidomyiiae (Diptera). With some common species of Saw-flies\r\n  (Tenthredinae) Mr. F. Smith has reared hundreds of specimens\r\n  from larvae of all sizes, but has never reared a single male: on\r\n  the other hand Curtis says,[403] that with certain species\r\n  (Athalia), bred by him, the males to the females were as six to\r\n  one; whilst exactly the reverse occurred with the mature\r\n  insects of the same species caught in the fields. With the\r\n  Neuroptera, Mr. Walsh states that in many, but by no means in\r\n  all, the species of the Odonatous groups (Ephemerina), there is\r\n  a great overplus of males: in the genus Hetaerina, also, the\r\n  males are generally at least four times as numerous as the\r\n  females. In certain species in the genus Gomphus the males are\r\n  equally numerous, whilst in two other species, the females are\r\n  twice or thrice as numerous as the males. In some European\r\n  species of Psocus thousands of females may be collected without\r\n  a single male, whilst with other species of the same genus both\r\n  sexes are common.[404] In England, Mr. MacLachlan has captured\r\n  hundreds of the female _Apatania muliebris_, but has never seen\r\n  the male; and of _Boreus hyemalis_ only four or five males have\r\n  been here seen.[405] With most of these species (excepting, as\r\n  I have heard, with the Tenthredinae) there is no reason to\r\n  suppose that the females are subject to parthenogenesis; and\r\n  thus we see how ignorant we are on the causes of the apparent\r\n  discrepancy in the proportional numbers of the two sexes.\r\n\r\n  In the other Classes of the Articulata I have been able to\r\n  collect still less information. With Spiders, Mr. Blackwall,\r\n  who has carefully attended to this class during many years,\r\n  writes to me that the males from their more erratic habits are\r\n  more commonly seen, and therefore appear to be the more\r\n  numerous. This is actually the case with a few species; but he\r\n  mentions several species in six genera, in which the females\r\n  appear to be much more numerous than the males.[406] The small\r\n  size of the males in comparison with the females, which is\r\n  sometimes carried to an extreme degree, and their widely\r\n  different appearance, may account in some instances for their\r\n  rarity in collections.[407]\r\n\r\n  Some of the lower Crustaceans are able to propagate their kind\r\n  asexually, and this will account for the extreme rarity of the\r\n  males. With some other forms (as with Tanais and Cypris) there\r\n  is reason to believe, as Fritz Mueller informs me, that the male\r\n  is much shorter-lived than the female, which, supposing the two\r\n  sexes to be at first equal in number, would explain the\r\n  scarcity of the males. On the other hand this same naturalist\r\n  has invariably taken, on the shores of Brazil, far more males\r\n  than females of the Diastylidae and of Cypridina; thus with a\r\n  species in the latter genus, 63 specimens caught the same day,\r\n  included 57 males; but he suggests that this preponderance may\r\n  be due to some unknown difference in the habits of the two\r\n  sexes. With one of the higher Brazilian crabs, namely a\r\n  Gelasimus, Fritz Mueller found the males to be more numerous\r\n  than the females. The reverse seems to be the case, according\r\n  to the large experience of Mr. C. Spence Bate, with six common\r\n  British crabs, the names of which he has given me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Power of Natural Selection to regulate the proportional Numbers\r\nof the Sexes, and General Fertility._--In some peculiar cases, an excess\r\nin the number of one sex over the other might be a great advantage to a\r\nspecies, as with the sterile females of social insects, or with those\r\nanimals in which more than one male is requisite to fertilise the\r\nfemale, as with certain cirripedes and perhaps certain fishes. An\r\ninequality between the sexes in these cases might have been acquired\r\nthrough natural selection, but from their rarity they need not here be\r\nfurther considered. In all ordinary cases an inequality would be no\r\nadvantage or disadvantage to certain individuals more than to others;\r\nand therefore it could hardly have resulted from natural selection. We\r\nmust attribute the inequality to the direct action of those unknown\r\nconditions, which with mankind lead to the males being born in a\r\nsomewhat larger excess in certain countries than in others, or which\r\ncause the proportion between the sexes to differ slightly in legitimate\r\nand illegitimate births.\r\n\r\nLet us now take the case of a species producing from the unknown causes\r\njust alluded to, an excess of one sex--we will say of males--these being\r\nsuperfluous and useless, or nearly useless. Could the sexes be equalised\r\nthrough natural selection? We may feel sure, from all characters being\r\nvariable, that certain pairs would produce a somewhat less excess of\r\nmales over females than other pairs. The former, supposing the actual\r\nnumber of the offspring to remain constant, would necessarily produce\r\nmore females, and would therefore be more productive. On the doctrine of\r\nchances a greater number of the offspring of the more productive pairs\r\nwould survive; and these would inherit a tendency to procreate fewer\r\nmales and more females. Thus a tendency towards the equalisation of the\r\nsexes would be brought about. But our supposed species would by this\r\nprocess be rendered, as just remarked, more productive; and this would\r\nin many cases be far from an advantage; for whenever the limit to the\r\nnumbers which exist, depends, not on destruction by enemies, but on the\r\namount of food, increased fertility will lead to severer competition and\r\nto most of the survivors being badly fed. In this case, if the sexes\r\nwere equalised by an increase in the number of the females, a\r\nsimultaneous decrease in the total number of the offspring would be\r\nbeneficial, or even necessary, for the existence of the species; and\r\nthis, I believe, could be effected through natural selection in the\r\nmanner hereafter to be described. The same train of reasoning is\r\napplicable in the above, as well as in the following case, if we assume\r\nthat females instead of males are produced in excess, for such females\r\nfrom not uniting with males would be superfluous and useless. So it\r\nwould be with polygamous species, if we assume the excess of females to\r\nbe inordinately great.\r\n\r\nAn excess of either sex, we will again say of the males, could, however,\r\napparently be eliminated through natural selection in another and\r\nindirect manner, namely by an actual diminution of the males, without\r\nany increase of the females, and consequently without any increase in\r\nthe productiveness of the species. From the variability of all\r\ncharacters, we may feel assured that some pairs, inhabiting any\r\nlocality, would produce a rather smaller excess of superfluous males,\r\nbut an equal number of productive females. When the offspring from the\r\nmore and the less male-productive parents were all mingled together,\r\nnone would have any direct advantage over the others; but those that\r\nproduced few superfluous males would have one great indirect advantage,\r\nnamely that their ova or embryos would probably be larger and finer, or\r\ntheir young better nurtured in the womb and afterwards. We see this\r\nprinciple illustrated with plants; as those which bear a vast number of\r\nseed produce small ones; whilst those which bear comparatively few\r\nseeds, often produce large ones well-stocked with nutriment for the use\r\nof the seedlings.[408] Hence the offspring of the parents which had\r\nwasted least force in producing superfluous males would be the most\r\nlikely to survive, and would inherit the same tendency not to produce\r\nsuperfluous males, whilst retaining their full fertility in the\r\nproduction of females. So it would be with the converse case of the\r\nfemale sex. Any slight excess, however, of either sex could hardly be\r\nchecked in so indirect a manner. Nor indeed has a considerable\r\ninequality between the sexes been always prevented, as we have seen in\r\nsome of the cases given in the previous discussion. In these cases the\r\nunknown causes which determine the sex of the embryo, and which under\r\ncertain conditions lead to the production of one sex in excess over the\r\nother, have not been mastered by the survival of those varieties which\r\nwere subjected to the least waste of organised matter and force by the\r\nproduction of superfluous individuals of either sex. Nevertheless we may\r\nconclude that natural selection will always tend, though sometimes\r\ninefficiently, to equalise the relative numbers of the two sexes.\r\n\r\nHaving said this much on the equalisation of the sexes, it may be well\r\nto add a few remarks on the regulation through natural selection of the\r\nordinary fertility of species. Mr. Herbert Spencer has shewn in an able\r\ndiscussion[409] that with all organisms a ratio exists between what he\r\ncalls individuation and genesis; whence it follows that beings which\r\nconsume much matter or force in their growth, complicated structure or\r\nactivity, or which produce ova and embryos of large size, or which\r\nexpend much energy in nurturing their young, cannot be so productive as\r\nbeings of an opposite nature. Mr. Spencer further shews that minor\r\ndifferences in fertility will be regulated through natural selection.\r\nThus the fertility of each species will tend to increase, from the more\r\nfertile pairs producing a larger number of offspring, and these from\r\ntheir mere number will have the best chance of surviving, and will\r\ntransmit their tendency to greater fertility. The only check to a\r\ncontinued augmentation of fertility in each organism seems to be either\r\nthe expenditure of more power and the greater risks run by the parents\r\nthat produce a more numerous progeny, or the contingency of very\r\nnumerous eggs and young being produced of smaller size, or less\r\nvigorous, or subsequently not so well nurtured. To strike a balance in\r\nany case between the disadvantages which follow from the production of a\r\nnumerous progeny, and the advantages (such as the escape of at least\r\nsome individuals from various dangers) is quite beyond our power of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nWhen an organism has once been rendered extremely fertile, how its\r\nfertility can be reduced through natural selection is not so clear as\r\nhow this capacity was first acquired. Yet it is obvious that if\r\nindividuals of a species, from a decrease of their natural enemies, were\r\nhabitually reared in larger numbers than could be supported, all the\r\nmembers would suffer. Nevertheless the offspring from the less fertile\r\nparents would have no direct advantage over the offspring from the more\r\nfertile parents, when all were mingled together in the same district.\r\nAll the individuals would mutually tend to starve each other. The\r\noffspring indeed of the less fertile parents would lie under one great\r\ndisadvantage, for from the simple fact of being produced in smaller\r\nnumbers, they would be the most liable to extermination. Indirectly,\r\nhowever, they would partake of one great advantage; for under the\r\nsupposed condition of severe competition, when all were pressed for\r\nfood, it is extremely probable that those individuals which from some\r\nvariation in their constitution produced fewer eggs or young, would\r\nproduce them of greater size or vigour; and the adults reared from such\r\neggs or young would manifestly have the best chance of surviving, and\r\nwould inherit a tendency towards lessened fertility. The parents,\r\nmoreover, which had to nourish or provide for fewer offspring would\r\nthemselves be exposed to a less severe strain in the struggle for\r\nexistence, and would have a better chance of surviving. By these steps,\r\nand by no others as far as I can see, natural selection under the above\r\nconditions of severe competition for food, would lead to the formation\r\nof a new race less fertile, but better adapted for survival, than the\r\nparent-race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS IN THE LOWER CLASSES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  These characters absent in the lowest classes--Brilliant\r\n  colours--Mollusca--Annelids--Crustacea, secondary sexual\r\n  characters strongly developed; dimorphism; colour; characters\r\n  not acquired before maturity--Spiders, sexual colours of;\r\n  stridulation by the males--Myriapoda.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the lowest classes the two sexes are not rarely united in the same\r\nindividual, and therefore secondary sexual characters cannot be\r\ndeveloped. In many cases in which the two sexes are separate, both are\r\npermanently attached to some support, and the one cannot search or\r\nstruggle for the other. Moreover it is almost certain that these animals\r\nhave too imperfect senses and much too low mental powers to feel mutual\r\nrivalry, or to appreciate each other's beauty or other attractions.\r\n\r\nHence in these classes, such as the Protozoa, Coelenterata,\r\nEchinodermata, Scolecida, true secondary sexual characters do not occur;\r\nand this fact agrees with the belief that such characters in the higher\r\nclasses have been acquired through sexual selection, which depends on\r\nthe will, desires, and choice of either sex. Nevertheless some few\r\napparent exceptions occur; thus, as I hear from Dr. Baird, the males of\r\ncertain Entozoa, or internal parasitic worms, differ slightly in colour\r\nfrom the females; but we have no reason to suppose that such differences\r\nhave been augmented through sexual selection.\r\n\r\nMany of the lower animals, whether hermaphrodites or with the sexes\r\nseparate, are ornamented with the most brilliant tints, or are shaded\r\nand striped in an elegant manner. This is the case with many corals and\r\nsea-anemonies (Actiniae), with some jelly-fish (Medusae, Porpita, &c.),\r\nwith some Planariae, Ascidians, numerous Star-fishes, Echini, &c.; but we\r\nmay conclude from the reasons already indicated, namely the union of the\r\ntwo sexes in some of these animals, the permanently affixed condition of\r\nothers, and the low mental powers of all, that such colours do not serve\r\nas a sexual attraction, and have not been acquired through sexual\r\nselection. With the higher animals the case is very different; for with\r\nthem when one sex is much more brilliantly or conspicuously coloured\r\nthan the other, and there is no difference in the habits of the two\r\nsexes which will account for this difference, we have reason to believe\r\nin the influence of sexual selection; and this belief is strongly\r\nconfirmed when the more ornamented individuals, which are almost always\r\nthe males, display their attractions before the other sex. We may also\r\nextend this conclusion to both sexes, when coloured alike, if their\r\ncolours are plainly analogous to those of one sex alone in certain other\r\nspecies of the same group.\r\n\r\nHow, then, are we to account for the beautiful or even gorgeous colours\r\nof many animals in the lowest classes? It appears very doubtful whether\r\nsuch colours usually serve as a protection; but we are extremely liable\r\nto err in regard to characters of all kinds in relation to protection,\r\nas will be admitted by every one who has read Mr. Wallace's excellent\r\nessay on this subject. It would not, for instance, at first occur to any\r\none that the perfect transparency of the Medusae, or jelly-fishes, was of\r\nthe highest service to them as a protection; but when we are reminded\r\nby Haeckel that not only the medusae but many floating mollusca,\r\ncrustaceans, and even small oceanic fishes partake of this same\r\nglass-like structure, we can hardly doubt that they thus escape the\r\nnotice of pelagic birds and other enemies.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our ignorance how far colour in many cases serves as a\r\nprotection, the most probable view in regard to the splendid tints of\r\nmany of the lowest animals seems to be that their colours are the direct\r\nresult either of the chemical nature or the minute structure of their\r\ntissues, independently of any benefit thus derived. Hardly any colour is\r\nfiner than that of arterial blood; but there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat the colour of the blood is in itself any advantage; and though it\r\nadds to the beauty of the maiden's cheek, no one will pretend that it\r\nhas been acquired for this purpose. So again with many animals,\r\nespecially the lower ones, the bile is richly coloured; thus the extreme\r\nbeauty of the Eolidae (naked sea-slugs) is chiefly due, as I am informed\r\nby Mr. Hancock, to the biliary glands seen through the translucent\r\ninteguments; this beauty being probably of no service to these animals.\r\nThe tints of the decaying leaves in an American forest are described by\r\nevery one as gorgeous; yet no one supposes that these tints are of the\r\nleast advantage to the trees. Bearing in mind how many substances\r\nclosely analogous to natural organic compounds have been recently formed\r\nby chemists, and which exhibit the most splendid colours, it would have\r\nbeen a strange fact if substances similarly coloured had not often\r\noriginated, independently of any useful end being thus gained, in the\r\ncomplex laboratory of living organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The sub-kingdom of the Mollusca._--Throughout this great division\r\n(taken in its largest acceptation) of the animal kingdom, secondary\r\nsexual characters, such as we are here considering, never, as far as I\r\ncan discover, occur. Nor could they be expected in the three lowest\r\nclasses, namely in the Ascidians, Polyzoa, and Brachiopods (constituting\r\nthe Molluscoida of Huxley), for most of these animals are permanently\r\naffixed to a support or have their sexes united in the same individual.\r\nIn the Lamellibranchiata, or bivalve shells, hermaphroditism is not\r\nrare. In the next higher class of the Gasteropoda, or marine univalve\r\nshells, the sexes are either united or separate. But in this latter case\r\nthe males never possess special organs for finding, securing, or\r\ncharming the females, or for fighting with other males. The sole\r\nexternal difference between the sexes consists, as I am informed by Mr.\r\nGwyn Jeffreys, in the shell sometimes differing a little in form; for\r\ninstance, the shell of the male periwinkle (_Littorina littorea_) is\r\nnarrower and has a more elongated spire than that of the female. But\r\ndifferences of this nature, it may be presumed, are directly connected\r\nwith the act of reproduction or with the development of the ova.\r\n\r\nThe Gasteropoda, though capable of locomotion and furnished with\r\nimperfect eyes, do not appear to be endowed with sufficient mental\r\npowers for the members of the same sex to struggle together in rivalry,\r\nand thus to acquire secondary sexual characters. Nevertheless with the\r\npulmoniferous gasteropods, or land-snails, the pairing is preceded by\r\ncourtship; for these animals, though hermaphrodites, are compelled by\r\ntheir structure to pair together. Agassiz remarks,[410] \"Quiconque a eu\r\nl'occasion d'observer les amours des limacons, ne saurait mettre en\r\ndoute la seduction deployee dans les mouvements et les allures qui\r\npreparent et accomplissent le double embrassement de ces\r\nhermaphrodites.\" These animals appear also susceptible of some degree of\r\npermanent attachment: an accurate observer, Mr. Lonsdale, informs me\r\nthat he placed a pair of land-shells (_Helix pomatia_), one of which was\r\nweakly, into a small and ill-provided garden. After a short time the\r\nstrong and healthy individual disappeared, and was traced by its track\r\nof slime over a wall into an adjoining well-stocked garden. Mr. Lonsdale\r\nconcluded that it had deserted its sickly mate; but after an absence of\r\ntwenty-four hours it returned, and apparently communicated the result of\r\nits successful exploration, for both then started along the same track\r\nand disappeared over the wall.\r\n\r\nEven in the highest class of the Mollusca, namely the Cephalopoda or\r\ncuttle-fishes, in which the sexes are separate, secondary sexual\r\ncharacters of the kind which we are here considering, do not, as far as\r\nI can discover, occur. This is a surprising circumstance, as these\r\nanimals possess highly-developed sense-organs and have considerable\r\nmental powers, as will be admitted by every one who has watched their\r\nartful endeavours to escape from an enemy.[411] Certain Cephalopoda,\r\nhowever, are characterised by one extraordinary sexual character,\r\nnamely, that the male element collects within one of the arms or\r\ntentacles, which is then cast off, and, clinging by its sucking-discs to\r\nthe female, lives for a time an independent life. So completely does the\r\ncast-off arm resemble a separate animal, that it was described by Cuvier\r\nas a parasitic worm under the name of Hectocotyle. But this marvellous\r\nstructure may be classed as a primary rather than as a secondary sexual\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAlthough with the Mollusca sexual selection does not seem to have come\r\ninto play; yet many univalve and bivalve shells, such as volutes, cones,\r\nscallops, &c., are beautifully coloured and shaped. The colours do not\r\nappear in most cases to be of any use as a protection; they are probably\r\nthe direct result, as in the lowest classes, of the nature of the\r\ntissues; the patterns and the sculpture of the shell depending on its\r\nmanner of growth. The amount of light seems to a certain extent to be\r\ninfluential; for although, as repeatedly stated by Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys,\r\nthe shells of some species living at a profound depth are brightly\r\ncoloured, yet we generally see the lower surfaces and the parts covered\r\nby the mantle less highly coloured than the upper and exposed\r\nsurfaces.[412] In some cases, as with shells living amongst corals or\r\nbrightly-tinted sea-weeds, the bright colours may serve as a protection.\r\nBut many of the nudibranch mollusca, or sea-slugs, are as beautifully\r\ncoloured as any shells, as may be seen in Messrs. Alder and Hancock's\r\nmagnificent work; and from information kindly given me by Mr. Hancock,\r\nit is extremely doubtful whether these colours usually serve as a\r\nprotection. With some species this may be the case, as with one which\r\nlives on the green leaves of algae, and is itself bright-green. But many\r\nbrightly-coloured, white or otherwise conspicuous species, do not seek\r\nconcealment; whilst again some equally conspicuous species, as well as\r\nother dull-coloured kinds, live under stones and in dark recesses. So\r\nthat with these nudibranch molluscs, colour apparently does not stand in\r\nany close relation to the nature of the places which they inhabit.\r\n\r\nThese naked sea-slugs are hermaphrodites, yet they pair together, as do\r\nland-snails, many of which have extremely pretty shells. It is\r\nconceivable that two hermaphrodites, attracted by each others' greater\r\nbeauty, might unite and leave offspring which would inherit their\r\nparents' greater beauty. But with such lowly-organised creatures this is\r\nextremely improbable. Nor is it at all obvious how the offspring from\r\nthe more beautiful pairs of hermaphrodites would have any advantage, so\r\nas to increase in numbers, over the offspring of the less beautiful,\r\nunless indeed vigour and beauty generally coincided. We have not here a\r\nnumber of males becoming mature before the females, and the more\r\nbeautiful ones selected by the more vigorous females. If, indeed,\r\nbrilliant colours were beneficial to an hermaphrodite animal in relation\r\nto its general habits of life, the more brightly-tinted individuals\r\nwould succeed best and would increase in number; but this would be a\r\ncase of natural and not of sexual selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sub-kingdom of the Vermes or Annulosa_: Class, _Annelida (or\r\nSea-worms)_.--In this class, although the sexes (when separate)\r\nsometimes differ from each other in characters of such importance that\r\nthey have been placed under distinct genera or even families, yet the\r\ndifferences do not seem of the kind which can be safely attributed to\r\nsexual selection. These animals, like those in the preceding classes,\r\napparently stand too low in the scale, for the individuals of either sex\r\nto exert any choice in selecting a partner, or for the individuals of\r\nthe same sex to struggle together in rivalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sub-kingdom of the Arthropoda_: Class, _Crustacea_.--In this great\r\nclass we first meet with undoubted secondary sexual characters, often\r\ndeveloped in a remarkable manner. Unfortunately the habits of\r\ncrustaceans are very imperfectly known, and we cannot explain the uses\r\nof many structures peculiar to one sex. With the lower parasitic species\r\nthe males are of small size, and they alone are furnished with perfect\r\nswimming-legs, antennae and sense-organs; the females being destitute of\r\nthese organs, with their bodies often consisting of a mere distorted\r\nmass. But these extraordinary differences between the two sexes are no\r\ndoubt related to their widely different habits of life, and consequently\r\ndo not concern us. In various crustaceans, belonging to distinct\r\nfamilies, the anterior antennae are furnished with peculiar thread-like\r\nbodies, which are believed to act as smelling-organs, and these are much\r\nmore numerous in the males than in the females. As the males, without\r\nany unusual development of their olfactory organs, would almost\r\ncertainly be able sooner or later to find the females, the increased\r\nnumber of the smelling-threads has probably been acquired through sexual\r\nselection, by the better provided males having been the most successful\r\nin finding partners and in leaving offspring. Fritz Mueller has described\r\na remarkable dimorphic species of Tanais, in which the male is\r\nrepresented by two distinct forms, never graduating into each other. In\r\nthe one form the male is furnished with more numerous smelling-threads,\r\nand in the other form with more powerful and more elongated chelae or\r\npincers which serve to hold the female. Fritz Mueller suggests that these\r\ndifferences between the two male forms of the same species must have\r\noriginated in certain individuals having varied in the number of the\r\nsmelling-threads, whilst other individuals varied in the shape and size\r\nof their chelae; so that of the former, those which were best able to\r\nfind the female, and of the latter, those which were best able to hold\r\nher when found, have left the greater number of progeny to inherit their\r\nrespective advantages.[413]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Labidocera Darwinii, (from Lubbock).\r\n\r\n_a._ Part of right-hand anterior antenna of male, forming a prehensile\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n_b._ Posterior pair of thoracic legs of male.\r\n\r\n_c._ Ditto of female.]\r\n\r\nIn some of the lower crustaceans, the right-hand anterior antenna of the\r\nmale differs greatly in structure from the left-hand one, the latter\r\nresembling in its simple tapering joints the antennae of the female. In\r\nthe male the modified antenna is either swollen in the middle or\r\nangularly bent, or converted (fig. 3) into an elegant, and sometimes\r\nwonderfully complex, prehensile organ.[414] It serves, as I hear from\r\nSir J. Lubbock, to hold the female, and for this same purpose one of the\r\ntwo posterior legs (_b_) on the same side of the body is converted into\r\na forceps. In another family the inferior or posterior antennae are\r\n\"curiously zigzagged\" in the males alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Anterior part of body of Callianassa (from\r\nMilne-Edwards), showing the unequal and differently-constructed right\r\nand left-hand chelae of the male.\r\n\r\nN.B.--The artist by mistake has reversed the drawing, and made the\r\nleft-hand chela the largest.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Second leg of male Orchestia Tucuratinga (from\r\nFritz Mueller).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Ditto of female.]\r\n\r\nIn the higher crustaceans the anterior legs form a pair of chelae or\r\npincers, and these are generally larger in the male than in the female.\r\nIn many species the chelae on the opposite sides of the body are of\r\nunequal size, the right-hand one being, as I am informed by Mr. C.\r\nSpence Bate, generally, though not invariably, the largest. This\r\ninequality is often much greater in the male than in the female. The two\r\nchelae also often differ in structure (figs. 4, 5, and 6), the smaller one\r\nresembling those of the female. What advantage is gained by their\r\ninequality in size on the opposite sides of the body, and by the\r\ninequality being much greater in the male than in the female; and why,\r\nwhen they are of equal size, both are often much larger in the male than\r\nin the female, is not known. The chelae are sometimes of such length and\r\nsize that they cannot possibly be used, as I hear from Mr. Spence Bate,\r\nfor carrying food to the mouth. In the males of certain freshwater\r\nprawns (Palaemon) the right leg is actually longer than the whole\r\nbody.[415] It is probable that the great size of one leg with its chelae\r\nmay aid the male in fighting with his rivals; but this use will not\r\naccount for their inequality in the female on the opposite sides\r\nof the body. In Gelasimus, according to a statement quoted by\r\nMilne-Edwards,[416] the male and female live in the same burrow, which\r\nis worth notice, as shewing that they pair, and the male closes the\r\nmouth of the burrow with one of its chelae, which is enormously\r\ndeveloped; so that here it indirectly serves as a means of defence.\r\nTheir main use, however, probably is to seize and to secure the female,\r\nand this in some instances, as with Gammarus, is known to be the case.\r\nThe sexes, however, of the common shore-crab (_Carcinus maenas_), as Mr.\r\nSpence Bate informs me, unite directly after the female has moulted her\r\nhard shell, and when she is so soft that she would be injured if seized\r\nby the strong pincers of the male; but as she is caught and carried\r\nabout by the male previously to the act of moulting, she could then be\r\nseized with impunity.\r\n\r\nFritz Mueller states that certain species of Melita are distinguished\r\nfrom all other amphipods by the females having \"the coxal lamellae of the\r\npenultimate pair of feet produced into hook-like processes, of which the\r\nmales lay hold with the hands of the first pair.\" The development of\r\nthese hook-like processes probably resulted from those females which\r\nwere the most securely held during the act of reproduction, having left\r\nthe largest number of offspring. Another Brazilian amphipod (_Orchestia\r\nDarwinii_, fig. 7) is described by Fritz Mueller, as presenting a case of\r\ndimorphism, like that of Tanais; for there are two male forms, which\r\ndiffer in the structure of their chelae.[417] As chelae of either shape\r\nwould certainly have sufficed to hold the female, for both are now used\r\nfor this purpose, the two male forms probably originated, by some having\r\nvaried in one manner and some in another; both forms having derived\r\ncertain special, but nearly equal advantages, from their differently\r\nshaped organs.\r\n\r\nIt is not known that male crustaceans fight together for the possession\r\nof the females, but this is probable; for with most animals when the\r\nmale is larger than the female, he seems to have acquired his greater\r\nsize by having conquered during many generations other males. Now Mr.\r\nSpence Bate informs me that in most of the crustacean orders, especially\r\nin the highest or the Brachyura, the male is larger than the female; the\r\nparasitic genera, however, in which the sexes follow different habits of\r\nlife, and most of the Entomostraca must be excepted. The chelae of many\r\ncrustaceans are weapons well adapted for fighting. Thus a Devil-crab\r\n(_Portunus puber_) was seen by a son of Mr. Bate fighting with a\r\n_Carcinus maenas_, and the latter was soon thrown on its back, and had\r\nevery limb torn from its body. When several males of a Brazilian\r\nGelasimus, a species furnished with immense pincers, were placed\r\ntogether by Fritz Mueller in a glass vessel, they mutilated and killed\r\neach other. Mr. Bate put a large male _Carcinus maenas_ into a pan of\r\nwater, inhabited by a female paired with a smaller male; the latter was\r\nsoon dispossessed, but, as Mr. Bate adds, \"if they fought, the victory\r\nwas a bloodless one, for I saw no wounds.\" This same naturalist\r\nseparated a male sand-skipper (so common on our sea-shores), _Gammarus\r\nmarinus_, from its female, both of which were imprisoned in the same\r\nvessel with many individuals of the same species. The female being thus\r\ndivorced joined her comrades. After an interval the male was again put\r\ninto the same vessel and he then, after swimming about for a time,\r\ndashed into the crowd, and without any fighting at once took away his\r\nwife. This fact shews that in the Amphipoda, an order low in the scale,\r\nthe males and females recognise each other, and are mutually attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Orchestia Darwinii (from Fritz Mueller), showing\r\nthe differently-constructed chelae of the two male forms.]\r\n\r\nThe mental powers of the Crustacea are probably higher than might have\r\nbeen expected. Any one who has tried to catch one of the shore-crabs, so\r\nnumerous on many tropical coasts, will have perceived how wary and alert\r\nthey are. There is a large crab (_Birgus latro_), found on coral\r\nislands, which makes at the bottom of a deep burrow a thick bed of the\r\npicked fibres of the cocoa-nut. It feeds on the fallen fruit of this\r\ntree by tearing off the husk, fibre by fibre; and it always begins at\r\nthat end where the three eye-like depressions are situated. It then\r\nbreaks through one of these eyes by hammering with its heavy front\r\npincers, and turning round, extracts the albuminous core with its narrow\r\nposterior pincers. But these actions are probably instinctive, so that\r\nthey would be performed as well by a young as by an old animal. The\r\nfollowing case, however, can hardly be so considered: a trustworthy\r\nnaturalist, Mr. Gardner,[418] whilst watching a shore-crab (Gelasimus)\r\nmaking its burrow, threw some shells towards the hole. One rolled in,\r\nand three other shells remained within a few inches of the mouth. In\r\nabout five minutes the crab brought out the shell which had fallen in,\r\nand carried it away to the distance of a foot; it then saw the three\r\nother shells lying near, and evidently thinking that they might likewise\r\nroll in, carried them to the spot where it had laid the first. It would,\r\nI think, be difficult to distinguish this act from one performed by man\r\nby the aid of reason.\r\n\r\nWith respect to colour which so often differs in the two sexes of\r\nanimals belonging to the higher classes, Mr. Spence Bate does not know\r\nof any well-marked instances with our British crustaceans. In some\r\ncases, however, the male and female differ slightly in tint, but Mr.\r\nBate thinks not more than may be accounted for by their different habits\r\nof life, such as by the male wandering more about and being thus more\r\nexposed to the light. In a curious Bornean crab, which inhabits sponges,\r\nMr. Bate could always distinguish the sexes by the male not having the\r\nepidermis so much rubbed off. Dr. Power tried to distinguish by colour\r\nthe sexes of the species which inhabit the Mauritius, but always failed,\r\nexcept with one species of Squilla, probably the _S. stylifera_, the\r\nmale of which is described as being \"of a beautiful blueish-green,\" with\r\nsome of the appendages cherry-red, whilst the female is clouded with\r\nbrown and grey, \"with the red about her much less vivid than in the\r\nmale.\"[419] In this case, we may suspect the agency of sexual selection.\r\nWith Saphirina (an oceanic genus of Entomostraca, and therefore low in\r\nthe scale) the males are furnished with minute shields or cell-like\r\nbodies, which exhibit beautiful changing colours; these being absent in\r\nthe females, and in the case of one species in both sexes.[420] It\r\nwould, however, be extremely rash to conclude that these curious organs\r\nserve merely to attract the females. In the female of a Brazilian\r\nspecies of Gelasimus, the whole body, as I am informed by Fritz Mueller,\r\nis of a nearly uniform greyish-brown. In the male the posterior part of\r\nthe cephalo-thorax is pure white, with the anterior part of a rich\r\ngreen, shading into dark brown; and it is remarkable that these colours\r\nare liable to change in the course of a few minutes--the white becoming\r\ndirty grey or even black, the green \"losing much of its brilliancy.\" The\r\nmales apparently are much more numerous than the females. It deserves\r\nespecial notice that they do not acquire their bright colours until they\r\nbecome mature. They differ also from the females in the larger size of\r\ntheir chelae. In some species of the genus, probably in all, the sexes\r\npair and inhabit the same burrow. They are also, as we have seen, highly\r\nintelligent animals. From these various considerations it seems highly\r\nprobable that the male in this species has become gaily ornamented in\r\norder to attract or excite the female.\r\n\r\nIt has just been stated that the male Gelasimus does not acquire his\r\nconspicuous colours until mature and nearly ready to breed. This seems\r\nthe general rule in the whole class with the many remarkable differences\r\nin structure between the two sexes. We shall hereafter find the same law\r\nprevailing throughout the great sub-kingdom of the Vertebrata, and in\r\nall cases it is eminently distinctive of characters which have been\r\nacquired through sexual selection. Fritz Mueller[421] gives some\r\nstriking instances of this law; thus the male sand-hopper (Orchestia)\r\ndoes not acquire his large claspers, which are very differently\r\nconstructed from those of the female, until nearly full-grown; whilst\r\nyoung his claspers resemble those of the female. Thus, again, the male\r\nBrachyscelus possesses, like all other amphipods, a pair of posterior\r\nantennae; the female, and this is a most extraordinary circumstance, is\r\ndestitute of them, and so is the male as long as he remains immature.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass, _Arachnida_ (Spiders).--The males are often darker, but sometimes\r\nlighter than the females, as may be seen in Mr. Blackwall's magnificent\r\nwork.[422] In some species the sexes differ conspicuously from each\r\nother in colour; thus the female of _Sparassus smaragdulus_ is\r\ndullish-green; whilst the adult male has the abdomen of a fine yellow,\r\nwith three longitudinal stripes of rich red. In some species of Thomisus\r\nthe two sexes closely resemble each other; in others they differ much;\r\nthus in _T. citreus_ the legs and body of the female are pale-yellow or\r\ngreen, whilst the front legs of the male are reddish-brown: in _T.\r\nfloricolens_, the legs of the female are pale-green, those of the male\r\nbeing ringed in a conspicuous manner with various tints. Numerous\r\nanalogous cases could be given in the genera Epeira, Nephila,\r\nPhilodromus, Theridion, Linyphia, &c. It is often difficult to say which\r\nof the two sexes departs most from the ordinary coloration of the genus\r\nto which the species belong; but Mr. Blackwall thinks that, as a\r\ngeneral rule, it is the male. Both sexes whilst young, as I am informed\r\nby the same author, usually resemble each other; and both often undergo\r\ngreat changes in colour during their successive moults before arriving\r\nat maturity. In other cases the male alone appears to change colour.\r\nThus the male of the above-mentioned brightly-coloured Sparassus at\r\nfirst resembles the female and acquires his peculiar tints only when\r\nnearly adult. Spiders are possessed of acute senses, and exhibit much\r\nintelligence. The females often shew, as is well known, the strongest\r\naffection for their eggs, which they carry about enveloped in a silken\r\nweb. On the whole it appears probable that well-marked differences in\r\ncolour between the sexes have generally resulted from sexual selection,\r\neither on the male or female side. But doubts may be entertained on this\r\nhead from the extreme variability in colour of some species, for\r\ninstance of _Theridion lineatum_, the sexes of which differ when adult;\r\nthis great variability indicates that their colours have not been\r\nsubjected to any form of selection.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwall does not remember to have seen the males of any species\r\nfighting together for the possession of the female. Nor, judging from\r\nanalogy, is this probable; for the males are generally much smaller than\r\nthe females, sometimes to an extraordinary degree.[423] Had the males\r\nbeen in the habit of fighting together, they would, it is probable, have\r\ngradually acquired greater size and strength. Mr. Blackwall has\r\nsometimes seen two or more males on the same web with a single female;\r\nbut their courtship is too tedious and prolonged an affair to be easily\r\nobserved. The male is extremely cautious in making his advances, as the\r\nfemale carries her coyness to a dangerous pitch. De Geer saw a male that\r\n\"in the midst of his preparatory caresses was seized by the object of\r\nhis attentions, enveloped by her in a web and then devoured, a sight\r\nwhich, as he adds, filled him with horror and indignation.\"[424]\r\n\r\nWestring has made the interesting discovery that the males of several\r\nspecies of Theridion[425] have the power of making a stridulating sound\r\n(like that made by many beetles and other insects, but feebler), whilst\r\nthe females are quite mute. The apparatus consists of a serrated ridge\r\nat the base of the abdomen, against which the hard hinder part of the\r\nthorax is rubbed; and of this structure not a trace could be detected in\r\nthe females. From the analogy of the Orthoptera and Homoptera, to be\r\ndescribed in the next chapter, we may feel almost sure that the\r\nstridulation serves, as Westring remarks, either to call or to excite\r\nthe female; and this is the first case in the ascending scale of the\r\nanimal kingdom, known to me, of sounds emitted for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass, _Myriapoda_.--In neither of the two orders in this class,\r\nincluding the millipedes and centipedes, can I find any well-marked\r\ninstances of sexual differences such as more particularly concern us. In\r\n_Glomeris limbata_, however, and perhaps in some few other species, the\r\nmales differ slightly in colour from the females; but this Glomeris is a\r\nhighly variable species. In the males of the Diplopoda, the legs\r\nbelonging to one of the anterior segments of the body, or to the\r\nposterior segment, are modified into prehensile hooks which serve to\r\nsecure the female. In some species of Iulus the tarsi of the male are\r\nfurnished with membranous suckers for the same purpose. It is a much\r\nmore unusual circumstance, as we shall see when we treat of Insects,\r\nthat it is the female in Lithobius which is furnished with prehensile\r\nappendages at the extremity of the body for holding the male.[426]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Diversified structures possessed by the males for seizing the\r\n  females--Differences between the sexes, of which the meaning is\r\n  not understood--Difference in size between the\r\n  sexes--Thysanura--Diptera--Hemiptera--Homoptera, musical powers\r\n  possessed by the males alone--Orthoptera, musical instruments\r\n  of the males, much diversified in structure; pugnacity;\r\n  colours--Neuroptera, sexual differences in colour--Hymenoptera,\r\n  pugnacity and colours--Coleoptera, colours; furnished with\r\n  great horns, apparently as an ornament; battles; stridulating\r\n  organs generally common to both sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the immense class of insects the sexes sometimes differ in their\r\norgans for locomotion, and often in their sense-organs, as in the\r\npectinated and beautifully plumose antennae of the males of many species.\r\nIn one of the Ephemerae, namely Chloeon, the male has great pillared\r\neyes, of which the female is entirely destitute.[427] The ocelli are\r\nabsent in the females of certain other insects, as in the Mutillidae,\r\nwhich are likewise destitute of wings. But we are chiefly concerned with\r\nstructures by which one male is enabled to conquer another, either in\r\nbattle or courtship, through his strength, pugnacity, ornaments, or\r\nmusic. The innumerable contrivances, therefore, by which the male is\r\nable to seize the female, may be briefly passed over. Besides the\r\ncomplex structures at the apex of the abdomen, which ought perhaps to be\r\nranked as primary organs,[428] \"it is astonishing,\" as Mr. B. D.\r\nWalsh[429] has remarked, \"how many different organs are worked in by\r\nnature, for the seemingly insignificant object of enabling the male to\r\ngrasp the female firmly.\" The mandibles or jaws are sometimes used for\r\nthis purpose; thus the male _Corydalis cornutus_ (a neuropterous insect\r\nin some degree allied to the Dragon-flies, &c.) has immense curved jaws,\r\nmany times longer than those of the female; and they are smooth instead\r\nof being toothed, by which means he is enabled to seize her without\r\ninjury.[430] One of the stag-beetles of North America (_Lucanus\r\nelaphus_) uses his jaws, which are much larger than those of the female,\r\nfor the same purpose, but probably likewise for fighting. In one of the\r\nsand-wasps (_Ammophila_) the jaws in the two sexes are closely alike,\r\nbut are used for widely different purposes; the males, as Professor\r\nWestwood observes, \"are exceedingly ardent, seizing their partners round\r\nthe neck with their sickle-shaped jaws;\"[431] whilst the females use\r\nthese organs for burrowing in sand-banks and making their nests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Crabro cribrarius. Upper figure, male: lower\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nThe tarsi of the front-legs are dilated in many male beetles, or are\r\nfurnished with broad cushions of hairs; and in many genera of\r\nwater-beetles they are armed with a round flat sucker, so that the male\r\nmay adhere to the slippery body of the female. It is a much more unusual\r\ncircumstance that the females of some water-beetles (Dytiscus) have\r\ntheir elytra deeply grooved, and in _Acilius sulcatus_ thickly set with\r\nhairs, as an aid to the male. The females of some other water-beetles\r\n(Hydroporus) have their elytra punctured for the same object.[432] In\r\nthe male of _Crabro cribrarius_ (fig. 8.), it is the tibia which is\r\ndilated into a broad horny plate, with minute membraneous dots, giving\r\nto it a singular appearance like that of a riddle.[433] In the male of\r\nPenthe (a genus of beetles) a few of the middle joints of the antennae\r\nare dilated and furnished on the inferior surface with cushions of\r\nhair, exactly like those on the tarsi of the Carabidae, \"and obviously\r\nfor the same end.\" In male dragon-flies, \"the appendages at the tip of\r\nthe tail are modified in an almost infinite variety of curious patterns\r\nto enable them to embrace the neck of the female.\" Lastly in the males\r\nof many insects, the legs are furnished with peculiar spines, knobs or\r\nspurs; or the whole leg is bowed or thickened, but this is by no means\r\ninvariably a sexual character; or one pair, or all three pairs are\r\nelongated, sometimes to an extravagant length.[434]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Taphroderes distortus (much enlarged). Upper\r\nfigure, male; lower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nIn all the orders, the sexes of many species present differences, of\r\nwhich the meaning is not understood. One curious case is that of a\r\nbeetle (fig. 9), the male of which has the left mandible much enlarged;\r\nso that the mouth is greatly distorted. In another Carabidous beetle,\r\nthe Eurygnathus,[435] we have the unique case, as far as known to Mr.\r\nWollaston, of the head of the female being much broader and larger,\r\nthough in a variable degree, than that of the male. Any number of such\r\ncases could be given. They abound in the Lepidoptera: one of the most\r\nextraordinary is that certain male butterflies have their fore-legs more\r\nor less atrophied, with the tibiae and tarsi reduced to mere rudimentary\r\nknobs. The wings, also, in the two sexes often differ in neuration,[436]\r\nand sometimes considerably in outline, as in the _Aricoris epitus_,\r\nwhich was shown to me in the British Museum by Mr. A. Butler. The males\r\nof certain South American butterflies have tufts of hair on the margins\r\nof the wings, and horny excrescences on the discs of the posterior\r\npair.[437] In several British butterflies, the males alone, as shewn by\r\nMr. Wonfor, are in parts clothed with peculiar scales.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the luminosity in the female glow-worm is likewise not\r\nunderstood; for it is very doubtful whether the primary use of the light\r\nis to guide the male to the female. It is no serious objection to this\r\nlatter belief that the males emit a feeble light; for secondary sexual\r\ncharacters proper to one sex are often developed in a slight degree in\r\nthe other sex. It is a more valid objection that the larvae shine, and in\r\nsome species brilliantly: Fritz Mueller informs me that the most luminous\r\ninsect which he ever beheld in Brazil, was the larva of some beetle.\r\nBoth sexes of certain luminous species of Elater emit light. Kirby and\r\nSpence suspect that the phosphorescence serves to frighten and drive\r\naway enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difference in Size between the Sexes._--With insects of all kinds the\r\nmales are commonly smaller than the females;[438] and this difference\r\ncan often be detected even in the larval state. So considerable is the\r\ndifference between the male and female cocoons of the silk-moth\r\n(_Bombyx mori_), that in France they are separated by a particular mode\r\nof weighing.[439] In the lower classes of the animal kingdom, the\r\ngreater size of the females seems generally to depend on their\r\ndeveloping an enormous number of ova; and this may to a certain extent\r\nhold good with insects. But Dr. Wallace has suggested a much more\r\nprobable explanation. He finds, after carefully attending to the\r\ndevelopment of the caterpillars of _Bombyx cynthia_ and _yamamai_, and\r\nespecially of some dwarfed caterpillars reared from a second brood on\r\nunnatural food, \"that in proportion as the individual moth is finer, so\r\nis the time required for its metamorphosis longer; and for this reason\r\nthe female, which is the larger and heavier insect, from having to carry\r\nher numerous eggs, will be preceded by the male, which is smaller and\r\nhas less to mature.\"[440] Now as most insects are short-lived, and as\r\nthey are exposed to many dangers, it would manifestly be advantageous to\r\nthe female to be impregnated as soon as possible. This end would be\r\ngained by the males being first matured in large numbers ready for the\r\nadvent of the females; and this again would naturally follow, as Mr. A.\r\nE. Wallace has remarked,[441] through natural selection; for the smaller\r\nmales would be first matured, and thus would procreate a large number of\r\noffspring which would inherit the reduced size of their male parents,\r\nwhilst the larger males from being matured later would leave fewer\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, exceptions to the rule of male insects being smaller\r\nthan the females; and some of these exceptions are intelligible. Size\r\nand strength would be an advantage to the males, which fight for the\r\npossession of the female; and in these cases the males, as with the\r\nstag-beetle (Lucanus), are larger than the females. There are, however,\r\nother beetles which are not known to fight together, of which the males\r\nexceed the females in size; and the meaning of this fact is not known;\r\nbut in some of these cases, as with the huge Dynastes and Megasoma, we\r\ncan at least see that there would be no necessity for the males to be\r\nsmaller than the females, in order to be matured before them, for these\r\nbeetles are not short-lived, and there would be ample time for the\r\npairing of the sexes. So, again, male dragon-flies (Libellulidae) are\r\nsometimes sensibly larger, and never smaller, than the females;[442] and\r\nthey do not, as Mr. MacLachlan believes, generally pair with the\r\nfemales, until a week or fortnight has elapsed, and until they have\r\nassumed their proper masculine colours. But the most curious case,\r\nshewing on what complex and easily-overlooked relations, so trifling a\r\ncharacter as a difference in size between the sexes may depend, is that\r\nof the aculeate Hymenoptera; for Mr. F. Smith informs me that throughout\r\nnearly the whole of this large group the males, in accordance with the\r\ngeneral rule, are smaller than the females and emerge about a week\r\nbefore them; but amongst the Bees, the males of _Apis mellifica_,\r\n_Anthidium manicatum_ and _Anthophora acervorum_, and amongst the\r\nFossores, the males of the _Methoca ichneumonides_, are larger than the\r\nfemales. The explanation of this anomaly is that a marriage-flight is\r\nabsolutely necessary with these species, and the males require great\r\nstrength and size in order to carry the females through the air.\r\nIncreased size has here been acquired in opposition to the usual\r\nrelation between size and the period of development, for the males,\r\nthough larger, emerge before the smaller females.\r\n\r\nWe will now review the several Orders, selecting such facts as more\r\nparticularly concern us. The Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths) will be\r\nretained for a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, _Thysanura_.--The members of this Order are lowly organised for\r\ntheir class. They are wingless, dull-coloured, minute insects, with\r\nugly, almost misshapen heads and bodies. The sexes do not differ; but\r\nthey offer one interesting fact, by showing that the males pay sedulous\r\ncourt to their females even low down in the animal scale. Sir J.\r\nLubbock[443] in describing the _Smynthurus luteus_, says: \"it is very\r\namusing to see these little creatures coquetting together. The male,\r\nwhich is much smaller than the female, runs round her, and they butt one\r\nanother, standing face to face, and moving backward and forward like two\r\nplayful lambs. Then the female pretends to run away and the male runs\r\nafter her with a queer appearance of anger, gets in front and stands\r\nfacing her again; then she turns coyly round, but he, quicker and more\r\nactive, scuttles round too, and seems to whip her with his antennae; then\r\nfor a bit they stand face to face, play with their antennae, and seem to\r\nbe all in all to one another.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, _Diptera_ (Flies).--The sexes differ little in colour. The\r\ngreatest difference, known to Mr. F. Walker, is in the genus Bibio, in\r\nwhich the males are blackish or quite black, and the females obscure\r\nbrownish-orange. The genus Elaphomyia, discovered by Mr. Wallace[444] in\r\nNew Guinea, is highly remarkable, as the males are furnished with horns,\r\nof which the females are quite destitute. The horns spring from beneath\r\nthe eyes, and curiously resemble those of stags, being either branched\r\nor palmated. They equal in length the whole of the body in one of the\r\nspecies. They might be thought to serve for fighting, but as in one\r\nspecies they are of a beautiful pink colour, edged with black, with a\r\npale central stripe, and as these insects have altogether a very elegant\r\nappearance, it is perhaps more probable that the horns serve as\r\nornaments. That the males of some Diptera fight together is certain; for\r\nProf. Westwood[445] has several times seen this with some species of\r\nTipula or Harry-long-legs. Many observers believe that when gnats\r\n(Culicidae) dance in the air in a body, alternately rising and falling,\r\nthe males are courting the females. The mental faculties of the Diptera\r\nare probably fairly well developed, for their nervous system is more\r\nhighly developed than in most other Orders of insects.[446]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, _Hemiptera_ (Field-Bugs).--Mr. J. W. Douglas, who has\r\nparticularly attended to the British species, has kindly given me an\r\naccount of their sexual differences. The males of some species are\r\nfurnished with wings, whilst the females are wingless; the sexes differ\r\nin the form of the body and elytra; in the second joints of their\r\nantennae and in their tarsi; but as the signification of these\r\ndifferences is quite unknown, they may be here passed over. The females\r\nare generally larger and more robust than the males. With British, and,\r\nas far as Mr. Douglas knows, with exotic species, the sexes do not\r\ncommonly differ much in colour; but in about six British species the\r\nmale is considerably darker than the female, and in about four other\r\nspecies the female is darker than the male. Both sexes of some species\r\nare beautifully marked with vermilion and black. It is doubtful whether\r\nthese colours serve as a protection. If in any species the males had\r\ndiffered from the females in an analogous manner, we might have been\r\njustified in attributing such conspicuous colours to sexual selection\r\nwith transference to both sexes.\r\n\r\nSome species of Reduvidae make a stridulating noise; and, in the case of\r\n_Pirates stridulus_, this is said[447] to be effected by the movement of\r\nthe neck within the pro-thoracic cavity. According to Westring,\r\n_Reduvius personatus_ also stridulates. But I have not been able to\r\nlearn any particulars about these insects; nor have I any reason to\r\nsuppose that they differ sexually in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, _Homoptera._--Every one who has wandered in a tropical forest\r\nmust have been astonished at the din made by the male Cicadae. The\r\nfemales are mute; as the Grecian poet Xenarchus says, \"Happy the Cicadas\r\nlive, since they all have voiceless wives.\" The noise thus made could be\r\nplainly heard on board the \"Beagle,\" when anchored at a quarter of a\r\nmile from the shore of Brazil; and Captain Hancock says it can be heard\r\nat the distance of a mile. The Greeks formerly kept, and the Chinese now\r\nkeep, these insects in cages for the sake of their song, so that it\r\nmust be pleasing to the ears of some men.[448] The Cicadidae usually sing\r\nduring the day; whilst the Fulgoridae appear to be night-songsters. The\r\nsound, according to Landois,[449] who has recently studied the subject,\r\nis produced by the vibration of the lips of the spiracles, which are set\r\ninto motion by a current of air emitted from the tracheae. It is\r\nincreased by a wonderfully complex resounding apparatus, consisting of\r\ntwo cavities covered by scales. Hence the sound may truly be called a\r\nvoice. In the female the musical apparatus is present, but very much\r\nless developed than in the male, and is never used for producing sound.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the object of the music, Dr. Hartman in speaking of the\r\n_Cicada septemdecim_ of the United States, says,[450] \"the drums are now\r\n(June 6th and 7th, 1851) heard in all directions. This I believe to be\r\nthe marital summons from the males. Standing in thick chestnut sprouts\r\nabout as high as my head, where hundreds were around me, I observed the\r\nfemales coming around the drumming males.\" He adds, \"this season (Aug.\r\n1868) a dwarf pear-tree in my garden produced about fifty larvae of _Cic.\r\npruinosa_; and I several times noticed the females to alight near a male\r\nwhile he was uttering his clanging notes.\" Fritz Mueller writes to me\r\nfrom S. Brazil that he has often listened to a musical contest between\r\ntwo or three males of a Cicada, having a particularly loud voice, and\r\nseated at a considerable distance from each other. As soon as the first\r\nhad finished his song, a second immediately began; and after he had\r\nconcluded, another began, and so on. As there is so much rivalry between\r\nthe males, it is probable that the females not only discover them by the\r\nsounds emitted, but that, like female birds, they are excited or allured\r\nby the male with the most attractive voice.\r\n\r\nI have not found any well-marked cases of ornamental differences between\r\nthe sexes of the Homoptera. Mr. Douglas informs me that there are three\r\nBritish species, in which the male is black or marked with black bands,\r\nwhilst the females are pale-coloured or obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, _Orthoptera_.--The males in the three saltatorial families\r\nbelonging to this Order are remarkable for their musical powers, namely\r\nthe Achetidae or crickets, the Locustidae for which there is no exact\r\nequivalent name in English, and the Acridiidae or grasshoppers. The\r\nstridulation produced by some of the Locustidae is so loud that it can be\r\nheard during the night at the distance of a mile;[451] and that made by\r\ncertain species is not unmusical even to the human ear, so that the\r\nIndians on the Amazons keep them in wicker cages. All observers agree\r\nthat the sounds serve either to call or excite the mute females. But it\r\nhas been noticed[452] that the male migratory locust of Russia (one of\r\nthe Acridiidae) whilst coupled with the female, stridulates from anger or\r\njealousy when approached by another male. The house-cricket when\r\nsurprised at night uses its voice to warn its fellows.[453] In North\r\nAmerica the Katy-did (_Platyphyllum concavum_, one of the Locustidae) is\r\ndescribed[454] as mounting on the upper branches of a tree, and in the\r\nevening beginning \"his noisy babble, while rival notes issue from the\r\nneighbouring trees, and the groves resound with the call of\r\n_Katy-did-she-did_, the live-long night.\" Mr. Bates, in speaking of the\r\nEuropean field-cricket (one of the Achetidae), says, \"the male has been\r\nobserved to place itself in the evening at the entrance of its burrow,\r\nand stridulate until a female approaches, when the louder notes are\r\nsucceeded by a more subdued tone, whilst the successful musician\r\ncaresses with his antennae the mate he has won.\"[455] Dr. Scudder was\r\nable to excite one of these insects to answer him, by rubbing on a file\r\nwith a quill.[456] In both sexes a remarkable auditory apparatus has\r\nbeen discovered by Von Siebold, situated in the front legs.[457]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Gryllus campestris (from Landois).\r\n\r\nRight-hand figure, under side of part of the wing-nervure, much\r\nmagnified, showing the teeth, _st_.\r\n\r\nLeft-hand figure, upper surface of wing-cover, with the projecting,\r\nsmooth nervure, _r._, across which the teeth (_st_) are scraped.]\r\n\r\nIn the three Families the sounds are differently produced. In the males\r\nOf the Achetidae both wing-covers have the same structure; and this in\r\nthe field-cricket (_Gryllus campestris_, fig. 10) consists, as\r\ndescribed by Landois,[458] of from 131 to 138 sharp, transverse ridges\r\nor teeth (_st_) on the under side of one of the nervures of the\r\nwing-cover. This toothed nervure is rapidly scraped across a projecting,\r\nsmooth, hard nervure (_r_) on the upper surface of the opposite wing.\r\nFirst one wing is rubbed over the other, and then the movement is\r\nreversed. Both wings are raised a little at the same time, so as to\r\nincrease the resonance. In some species the wing-covers of the males are\r\nfurnished at the base with a talc-like plate.[459] I have here given a\r\ndrawing (fig. 11) of the teeth on the under side of the nervure of\r\nanother species of Gryllus, viz. _G. domesticus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Teeth of Nervure of Gryllus domesticus (from\r\nLandois).]\r\n\r\nIn the Locustidae the opposite wing-covers differ in structure (fig. 12),\r\nand cannot, as in the last family, be indifferently used in a reversed\r\nmanner. The left wing, which acts as the bow of the fiddle, lies over\r\nthe right wing which serves as the fiddle itself. One of the nervures\r\n(_a_) on the under surface of the former is finely serrated, and is\r\nscraped across the prominent nervures on the upper surface of the\r\nopposite or right wing. In our British _Phasgonura viridissima_ it\r\nappeared to me that the serrated nervure is rubbed against the rounded\r\nhind corner of the opposite wing, the edge of which is thickened,\r\ncoloured brown, and very sharp. In the right wing, but not in the left,\r\nthere is a little plate, as transparent as talc, surrounded by nervures,\r\nand called the speculum. In _Ephippiger vitium_, a member of this same\r\nfamily, we have a curious subordinate modification; for the wing-covers\r\nare greatly reduced in size, but \"the posterior part of the pro-thorax\r\nis elevated into a kind of dome over the wing-covers, and which has\r\nprobably the effect of increasing the sound.\"[460]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Chlorocoelus Tanana (from Bates). _a_, _b_.\r\nLobes of opposite wing-covers.]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the musical apparatus is more differentiated or\r\nspecialised in the Locustidae, which includes I believe the most powerful\r\nperformers in the Order, than in the Achetidae, in which both wing-covers\r\nhave the same structure and the same function.[461] Landois, however,\r\ndetected in one of the Locustidae, namely in Decticus, a short and narrow\r\nrow of small teeth, mere rudiments, on the inferior surface of the\r\nright wing-cover, which underlies the other and is never used as the\r\nbow. I observed the same rudimentary structure on the under side of the\r\nright wing-cover in _Phasgonura viridissima_. Hence we may with\r\nconfidence infer that the Locustidae are descended from a form, in which,\r\nas in the existing Achetidae, both wing-covers had serrated nervures on\r\nthe under surface, and could be indifferently used as the bow; but that\r\nin the Locustidae the two wing-covers gradually became differentiated and\r\nperfected, on the principle of the division of labour, the one to act\r\nexclusively as the bow and the other as the fiddle. By what steps the\r\nmore simple apparatus in the Achetidae originated, we do not know, but it\r\nis probable that the basal portions of the wing-covers overlapped each\r\nother formerly as at present, and that the friction of the nervures\r\nproduced a grating sound, as I find is now the case with the wing-covers\r\nof the females.[462] A grating sound thus occasionally and accidentally\r\nmade by the males, if it served them ever so little as a love-call to\r\nthe females, might readily have been intensified through sexual\r\nselection by fitting variations in the roughness of the nervures having\r\nbeen continually preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13, Hind-leg of Stenobothrus pratorum: _r_, the\r\nstridulating ridge; lower figure, the teeth, forming the ridge, much\r\nmagnified (from Landois).]\r\n\r\nIn the last and third Family, namely the Acridiidae or grasshoppers, the\r\nstridulation is produced in a very different manner, and is not so\r\nshrill, according to Dr. Scudder, as in the preceding Families. The\r\ninner surface of the femur (fig. 13, _r_) is furnished with a\r\nlongitudinal row of minute, elegant, lancet-shaped, elastic teeth, from\r\n85 to 93 in number;[463] and these are scraped across the sharp,\r\nprojecting nervures on the wing-covers, which, are thus made to vibrate\r\nand resound. Harris[464] says that when one of the males begins to play,\r\nhe first \"bends the shank of the hind-leg beneath, the thigh, where it\r\nis lodged in a furrow designed to receive it, and then draws the leg\r\nbriskly up and down. He does not play both fiddles together, but\r\nalternately first upon one and then on the other.\" In many species, the\r\nbase of the abdomen is hollowed out into a great cavity which is\r\nbelieved to act as a resounding board. In Pneumora (fig. 14), a S.\r\nAfrican genus belonging to this same family, we meet with a new and\r\nremarkable modification: in the males a small notched ridge projects\r\nobliquely from each side of the abdomen, against which the hind femora\r\nare rubbed.[465] As the male is furnished with wings, the female being\r\nwingless, it is remarkable that the thighs are not rubbed in the usual\r\nmanner against the wing-covers; but this may perhaps be accounted for by\r\nthe unusually small size of the hind-legs. I have not been able to\r\nexamine the inner surface of the thighs, which, judging from analogy,\r\nwould be finely serrated. The species of Pneumora have been more\r\nprofoundly modified for the sake of stridulation than any other\r\northopterous insect; for in the male the whole body has been converted\r\ninto a musical instrument, being distended with air, like a great\r\npellucid bladder, so as to increase the resonance. Mr. Trimen informs me\r\nthat at the Cape of Good Hope these insects make a wonderful noise\r\nduring the night There is one exception to the rule that the females in\r\nthese three Families are destitute of an efficient musical apparatus;\r\nfor both sexes of Ephippiger (Locustidae) are said[466] to be thus\r\nprovided. This case may be compared with that of the reindeer, in which\r\nspecies alone both sexes possess horns. Although the female orthoptera\r\nare thus almost invariably mute, yet Landois[467] found rudiments of the\r\nstridulating organs on the femora of the female Acridiidae, and similar\r\nrudiments on the under surface of the wing-covers of the female\r\nAchetidae; but he failed to find any rudiments in the females of\r\nDecticus, one of the Locustidae. In the Homoptera the mute females of\r\nCicada, have the proper musical apparatus in an undeveloped state; and\r\nwe shall hereafter meet in other divisions of the animal kingdom with\r\ninnumerable instances of structures proper to the male being present in\r\na rudimentary condition in the female. Such cases appear at first sight\r\nto indicate that both sexes were primordially constructed in the same\r\nmanner, but that certain organs were subsequently lost by the females.\r\nIt is, however, a more probable view, as previously explained, that the\r\norgans in question were acquired by the males and partially transferred\r\nto the females.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Pneumora (from specimens in the British Museum).\r\nUpper figure, male; lower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nLandois has observed another interesting fact, namely that in the\r\nfemales of the Acridiidae, the stridulating teeth on the femora remain\r\nthroughout life in the same condition in which they first appear in both\r\nsexes during the larval state. In the males, on the other hand, they\r\nbecome fully developed and acquire their perfect structure at the last\r\nmoult, when the insect is mature and ready to breed.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts now given, we see that the means by which the males\r\nproduce their sounds are extremely diversified in the Orthoptera, and\r\nare altogether different from those employed by the Homoptera. But\r\nthroughout the animal kingdom we incessantly find the same object\r\ngained by the most diversified means; this being due to the whole\r\norganisation undergoing in the course of ages multifarious changes; and\r\nas part after part varies, different variations are taken advantage of\r\nfor the same general purpose. The diversification of the means for\r\nproducing sound in the three families of the Orthoptera and in the\r\nHomoptera, impresses the mind with the high importance of these\r\nstructures to the males, for the sake of calling or alluring the\r\nfemales. We need feel no surprise at the amount of modification which\r\nthe Orthoptera have undergone in this respect, as we now know, from Dr.\r\nScudder's remarkable discovery,[468] that there has been more than ample\r\ntime. This naturalist has lately found a fossil insect in the Devonian\r\nformation of New Brunswick, which is furnished with \"the well-known\r\ntympanum or stridulating apparatus of the male Locustidae.\" This insect,\r\nthough in most respects related to the Neuroptera, appears to connect,\r\nas is so often the case with very ancient forms, the two Orders of the\r\nNeuroptera and Orthoptera which are now generally ranked as quite\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nI have but little more to say on the Orthoptera. Some of the species are\r\nvery pugnacious: when two male field-crickets (_Gryllus campestris_) are\r\nconfined together, they fight till one kills the other; and the species\r\nof Mantis are described as manoeuvring with their sword-like\r\nfront-limbs, like hussars with their sabres. The Chinese keep these\r\ninsects in little bamboo cages and match them like game-cocks.[469] With\r\nrespect to colour, some exotic locusts are beautifully ornamented; the\r\nposterior wings being marked with red, blue, and black; but as\r\nthroughout the Order the two sexes rarely differ much in colour, it is\r\ndoubtful whether they owe these bright tints to sexual selection.\r\nConspicuous colours may be of use to these insects as a protection, on\r\nthe principle to be explained in the next chapter, by giving notice to\r\ntheir enemies that they are unpalatable. Thus it has been observed[470]\r\nthat an Indian brightly-coloured locust was invariably rejected when\r\noffered to birds and lizards. Some cases, however, of sexual differences\r\nin colour in this Order are known. The male of an American cricket[471]\r\nis described as being as white as ivory, whilst the female varies from\r\nalmost white to greenish-yellow or dusky. Mr. Walsh informs me that the\r\nadult male of _Spectrum femoratum_ (one of the Phasmidae) \"is of a\r\nshining brownish-yellow colour; the adult female being of a dull,\r\nopaque, cinereous-brown; the young of both sexes being green.\" Lastly, I\r\nmay mention that the male of one curious kind of cricket[472] is\r\nfurnished with \"a long membranous appendage, which falls over the face\r\nlike a veil;\" but whether this serves as an ornament is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, _Neuroptera_.--Little need here be said, except in regard to\r\ncolour. In the Ephemeridae the sexes often differ slightly in their\r\nobscure tints;[473] but it is not probable that the males are thus\r\nrendered attractive to the females. The Libellulidae or dragon-flies are\r\nornamented with splendid green, blue, yellow, and vermilion metallic\r\ntints; and the sexes often differ. Thus, the males of some of the\r\nAgrionidae, as Prof. Westwood remarks[474] \"are of a rich blue with black\r\nwings, whilst the females are fine green with colourless wings.\" But in\r\n_Agrion Ramburii_ these colours are exactly reversed in the two\r\nsexes.[475] In the extensive N. American genus of Hetaerina, the males\r\nalone have a beautiful carmine spot at the base of each wing. In _Anax\r\njunius_ the basal part of the abdomen in the male is a vivid\r\nultra-marine blue, and in the female grass-green. In the allied genus\r\nGomphus, on the other hand, and in some other genera, the sexes differ\r\nbut little in colour. Throughout the animal kingdom, similar cases of\r\nthe sexes of closely-allied forms either differing greatly, or very\r\nlittle, or not at all, are of frequent occurrence. Although with many\r\nLibellulidae there is so wide a difference in colour between the sexes,\r\nit is often difficult to say which is the most brilliant; and the\r\nordinary coloration of the two sexes is exactly reversed, as we have\r\njust seen, in one species of Agrion. It is not probable that their\r\ncolours in any case have been gained as a protection. As Mr. MacLachlan,\r\nwho has closely attended to this family, writes to me, dragon-flies--the\r\ntyrants of the insect-world--are the least liable of any insect to be\r\nattacked by birds or other enemies. He believes that their bright\r\ncolours serve as a sexual attraction. It deserves notice, as bearing on\r\nthis subject, that certain dragon-flies appear to be attracted by\r\nparticular colours: Mr. Patterson observed[476] that the species of\r\nAgrionidae, of which the males are blue, settled in numbers on the blue\r\nfloat of a fishing line; whilst two other species were attracted by\r\nshining white colours.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, first observed by Schelver, that the males,\r\nin several genera belonging to two sub-families, when they first emerge\r\nfrom the pupal state are coloured exactly like the females; but that\r\ntheir bodies in a short time assume a conspicuous milky-blue tint, owing\r\nto the exudation of a kind of oil, soluble in ether and alcohol. Mr.\r\nMacLachlan believes that in the male of _Libellula depressa_ this change\r\nof colour does not occur until nearly a fortnight after the\r\nmetamorphosis, when the sexes are ready to pair.\r\n\r\nCertain species of Neurothemis present, according to Brauer[477] a\r\ncurious case of dimorphism, some of the females having their wings\r\nnetted in the usual manner; whilst other females have them \"very richly\r\nnetted as in the males of the same species.\" Brauer \"explains the\r\nphenomenon on Darwinian principles by the supposition that the close\r\nnetting of the veins is a secondary sexual character in the males.\" This\r\nlatter character is generally developed in the males alone, but being,\r\nlike every other masculine character, latent in the female, is\r\noccasionally developed in them. We have here an illustration of the\r\nmanner in which the two sexes of many animals have probably come to\r\nresemble each other, namely by variations first appearing in the males,\r\nbeing preserved in them, and then transmitted to and developed in the\r\nfemales; but in this particular genus a complete transference is\r\noccasionally and abruptly effected. Mr. MacLachlan informs me of another\r\ncase of dimorphism occurring in several species of Agrion in which a\r\ncertain number of individuals are found of an orange colour, and these\r\nare invariably females. This is probably a case of reversion, for in\r\nthe true Libellulae, when the sexes differ in colour, the females are\r\nalways orange or yellow, so that supposing Agrion to be descended from\r\nsome primordial form having the characteristic sexual colours of the\r\ntypical Libellulae, it would not be surprising that a tendency to vary in\r\nthis manner should occur in the females alone.\r\n\r\nAlthough many dragon-flies are such large, powerful, and fierce insects,\r\nthe males have not been observed by Mr. MacLachlan to fight together,\r\nexcept, as he believes, in the case of some of the smaller species of\r\nAgrion. In another very distinct group in this Order, namely in the\r\nTermites or white ants, both sexes at the time of swarming may be seen\r\nrunning about, \"the male after the female, sometimes two chasing one\r\nfemale, and contending with great eagerness who shall win the\r\nprize.\"[478]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, _Hymenoptera_.--That inimitable observer, M. Fabre,[479] in\r\ndescribing the habits of Cerceris, a wasp-like insect, remarks that\r\n\"fights frequently ensue between the males for the possession of some\r\nparticular female, who sits an apparently unconcerned beholder of the\r\nstruggle for supremacy, and when the victory is decided, quietly flies\r\naway in company with the conqueror.\" Westwood[480] says that the males\r\nof one of the saw-flies (Tenthredinae) \"have been found fighting\r\ntogether, with their mandibles locked.\" As M. Fabre speaks of the males\r\nof Cerceris striving to obtain a particular female, it may be well to\r\nbear in mind that insects belonging to this Order have the power of\r\nrecognising each other after long intervals of time, and are deeply\r\nattached. For instance, Pierre Huber, whose accuracy no one doubts,\r\nseparated some ants, and when after an interval of four months they met\r\nothers which had formerly belonged to the same community, they mutually\r\nrecognised and caressed each other with their antennae. Had they been\r\nstrangers they would have fought together. Again, when two communities\r\nengage in a battle, the ants on the same side in the general confusion\r\nsometimes attack each other, but they soon perceive their mistake, and\r\nthe one ant soothes the other.[481]\r\n\r\nIn this Order slight differences in colour, according to sex, are\r\ncommon, but conspicuous differences are rare except in the family of\r\nBees; yet both sexes of certain groups are so brilliantly coloured--for\r\ninstance in Chrysis, in which vermilion and metallic greens\r\nprevail--that we are tempted to attribute the result to sexual\r\nselection. In the Ichneumonidae, according to Mr. Walsh,[482] the males\r\nare almost universally lighter coloured than the females. On the other\r\nhand, in the Tenthredinidae the males are generally darker than the\r\nfemales. In the Siricidae the sexes frequently differ; thus the male of\r\n_Sirex juvencus_ is banded with orange, whilst the female is dark\r\npurple; but it is difficult to say which sex is the most ornamented. In\r\n_Tremex columbae_ the female is much brighter coloured than the male.\r\nWith ants, as I am informed by Mr. F. Smith, the males of several\r\nspecies are black, the females being testaceous. In the family of Bees,\r\nespecially in the solitary species, as I hear from the same\r\ndistinguished entomologist, the sexes often differ in colour. The males\r\nare generally the brightest, and in Bombus as well as in Apathus, much\r\nmore variable in colour than the females. In _Anthophora retusa_ the\r\nmale is of a rich fulvous-brown, whilst the female is quite black: so\r\nare the females of several species of Xylocopa, the males being bright\r\nyellow. In an Australian bee (_Lestis bombylans_), the female is of an\r\nextremely brilliant steel-blue, sometimes tinted with vivid green; the\r\nmale being of a bright brassy colour clothed with rich fulvous\r\npubescence. As in this group the females are provided with excellent\r\ndefensive weapons in their stings, it is not probable that they have\r\ncome to differ in colour from the males for the sake of protection.\r\n\r\n_Mutilla Europaea_ emits a stridulating noise; and according to\r\nGoureau[483] both sexes have this power. He attributes the sound to the\r\nfriction of the third and preceding abdominal segments; and I find that\r\nthese surfaces are marked with very fine concentric ridges, but so is\r\nthe projecting thoracic collar, on which the head articulates; and this\r\ncollar, when scratched with the point of a needle, emits the proper\r\nsound. It is rather surprising that both sexes should have the power of\r\nstridulating, as the male is winged and the female wingless. It is\r\nnotorious that Bees express certain emotions, as of anger, by the tone\r\nof their humming, as do some dipterous insects; but I have not referred\r\nto these sounds, as they are not known to be in any way connected with\r\nthe act of courtship.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, _Coleoptera_ (Beetles).--Many beetles are coloured so as to\r\nresemble the surfaces which they habitually frequent. Other species are\r\nornamented with gorgeous metallic tints,--for instance, many Carabidae,\r\nwhich live on the ground and have the power of defending themselves by\r\nan intensely acrid secretion,--the splendid diamond-beetles which are\r\nprotected by an extremely hard covering,--many species of Chrysomela,\r\nsuch as _C. cerealis_, a large species beautifully striped with various\r\ncolours, and in Britain confined to the bare summit of Snowdon,--and a\r\nhost of other species. These splendid colours, which are often arranged\r\nin stripes, spots, crosses and other elegant patterns, can hardly be\r\nbeneficial, as a protection, except in the case of some flower-feeding\r\nspecies; and we cannot believe that they are purposeless. Hence the\r\nsuspicion arises, that they serve as a sexual attraction; but we have no\r\nevidence on this head, for the sexes rarely differ in colour. Blind\r\nbeetles, which cannot of course behold each other's beauty, never\r\nexhibit, as I hear from Mr. Waterhouse, jun., bright colours, though\r\nthey often have polished coats: but the explanation of their obscurity\r\nmay be that blind insects inhabit caves and other obscure stations.\r\n\r\nSome Longicorns, however, especially certain Prionidae, offer an\r\nexception to the common rule that the sexes of beetles do not differ in\r\ncolour. Most of these insects are large and splendidly coloured. The\r\nmales in the genus Pyrodes,[484] as I saw in Mr. Bates' collection, are\r\ngenerally redder but rather duller than the females, the latter being\r\ncoloured of a more or less splendid golden green. On the other hand, in\r\none species the male is golden-green, the female being richly tinted\r\nwith red and purple. In the genus Esmeralda the sexes differ so greatly\r\nin colour that they have been ranked as distinct species: in one species\r\nboth are of a beautiful shining green, but the male has a red thorax. On\r\nthe whole, as far as I could judge, the females of those Prionidae, in\r\nwhich the sexes differ, are coloured more richly than the males; and\r\nthis does not accord with the common rule in regard to colour when\r\nacquired through sexual selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Chalcosoma atlas. Upper figure, male (reduced);\r\nlower figure, female (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Copris isidis. (Left-hand figures, males.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Phanaeus faunus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Dipelicus cantori.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Onthophagus rangifer, enlarged.]\r\n\r\nA most remarkable distinction between the sexes of many beetles is\r\npresented by the great horns which rise from the head, thorax, or\r\nclypeus of the males; and in some few cases from the under surface of\r\nthe body. These horns, in the great family of the Lamellicorns, resemble\r\nthose of various quadrupeds, such as stags, rhinoceroses, &c., and are\r\nwonderful both from their size and diversified shapes. Instead of\r\ndescribing them, I have given figures of the males and females of some\r\nof the more remarkable forms. (Figs. 15 to 19.) The females generally\r\nexhibit rudiments of the horns in the form of small knobs or ridges; but\r\nsome are destitute of even a rudiment. On the other hand, the horns are\r\nnearly as well developed in the female as in the male of _Phanaeus\r\nlancifer_; and only a little less well developed in the females of some\r\nother species of the same genus and of Copris. In the several\r\nsubdivisions of the family, the differences in structure of the horns do\r\nnot run parallel, as I am informed by Mr. Bates, with their more\r\nimportant and characteristic differences; thus within the same natural\r\nsection of the genus Onthophagus, there are species which have either a\r\nsingle cephalic horn, or two distinct horns.\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases, the horns are remarkable from their excessive\r\nvariability; so that a graduated series can be formed, from the most\r\nhighly developed males to others so degenerate that they can barely be\r\ndistinguished from the females. Mr. Walsh[485] found that in _Phanaeus\r\ncarnifex_ the horns were thrice as long in some males as in others. Mr.\r\nBates, after examining above a hundred males of _Onthophagus rangifer_\r\n(fig. 19), thought that he had at last discovered a species in which\r\nthe horns did not vary; but further research proved the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary size of the horns, and their widely different\r\nstructure in closely-allied forms, indicate that they have been formed\r\nfor some important purpose; but their excessive variability in the males\r\nof the same species leads to the inference that this purpose cannot be\r\nof a definite nature. The horns do not show marks of friction, as if\r\nused for any ordinary work. Some authors suppose[486] that as the males\r\nwander much more than the females, they require horns as a defence\r\nagainst their enemies; but in many cases the horns do not seem well\r\nadapted for defence, as they are not sharp. The most obvious conjecture\r\nis that they are used by the males for fighting together; but they have\r\nnever been observed to fight; nor could Mr. Bates, after a careful\r\nexamination of numerous species, find any sufficient evidence in their\r\nmutilated or broken condition of their having been thus used. If the\r\nmales had been habitual fighters, their size would probably have been\r\nincreased through sexual selection, so as to have exceeded that of the\r\nfemale; but Mr. Bates, after comparing the two sexes in above a hundred\r\nspecies of the Copridae, does not find in well-developed individuals any\r\nmarked difference in this respect. There is, moreover, one beetle,\r\nbelonging to the same great division of the Lamellicorns, namely\r\nLethrus, the males of which are known to fight, but they are not\r\nprovided with horns, though their mandibles are much larger than those\r\nof the female.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, which best agrees with the fact of the horns having been\r\nso immensely yet not fixedly developed,--as shewn by their extreme\r\nvariability in the same species and by their extreme diversity in\r\nclosely-allied species--is that they have been acquired as ornaments.\r\nThis view will at first appear extremely improbable; but we shall\r\nhereafter find with many animals, standing much higher in the scale,\r\nnamely fishes, amphibians, reptiles and birds, that various kinds of\r\ncrests, knobs, horns and combs have been developed apparently for this\r\nsole purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Onitis furcifer, male, viewed from beneath.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Left-hand figure, male of Onitis furcifer,\r\nviewed laterally. Right-hand figure, female. _a._ Rudiment of cephalic\r\nhorn. _b._ Trace of thoracic horn or crest.]\r\n\r\nThe males of _Onitis furcifer_ (fig. 20) are furnished with singular\r\nprojections on their anterior femora, and with a great fork or pair of\r\nhorns on the lower surface of the thorax. This situation seems extremely\r\nill adapted for the display of these projections, and they may be of\r\nsome real service; but no use can at present be assigned to them. It is\r\na highly remarkable fact, that although the males do not exhibit even a\r\ntrace of horns on the upper surface of the body, yet in the females a\r\nrudiment of a single horn on the head (fig. 21, _a_), and of a crest\r\n(_b_) on the thorax, are plainly visible. That the slight thoracic crest\r\nin the female is a rudiment of a projection proper to the male, though\r\nentirely absent in the male of this particular species, is clear: for\r\nthe female of _Bubas bison_ (a form which comes next to _Onitis_) has a\r\nsimilar slight crest on the thorax, and the male has in the same\r\nsituation a great projection. So again there can be no doubt that the\r\nlittle point (_a_) on the head of the female _Onitis furcifer_, as well\r\nof the females of two or three allied species, is a rudimentary\r\nrepresentative of the cephalic horn, which is common to the males of so\r\nmany lamellicorn beetles, as in Phanaeus, fig. 17. The males indeed of\r\nsome unnamed beetles in the British Museum, which are believed actually\r\nto belong to the genus Onitis, are furnished with a similar horn. The\r\nremarkable nature of this case will be best perceived by an\r\nillustration: the Ruminant quadrupeds run parallel with the lamellicorn\r\nbeetles, in some females possessing horns as large as those of the male,\r\nin others having them much smaller, or existing as mere rudiments\r\n(though this is as rare with ruminants as it is common with\r\nLamellicorns), or in having none at all. Now if a new species of deer or\r\nsheep were discovered with the female bearing distinct rudiments of\r\nhorns, whilst the head of the male was absolutely smooth, we should have\r\na case like that of _Onitis furcifer_.\r\n\r\nIn this case the old belief of rudiments having been created to complete\r\nthe scheme of nature is so far from holding good, that all ordinary\r\nrules are completely broken through. The view which seems the most\r\nprobable is that some early progenitor of Onitis acquired, like other\r\nLamellicorns, horns on the head and thorax, and then transferred them,\r\nin a rudimentary condition, as with so many existing species, to the\r\nfemale, by whom they have ever since been retained. The subsequent loss\r\nof the horns by the male may have resulted through the principle of\r\ncompensation from the development of the projections on the lower\r\nsurface, whilst the female has not been thus affected, as she is not\r\nfurnished with these projections, and consequently has retained the\r\nrudiments of the horns on the upper surface. Although this view is\r\nsupported by the case of Bledius immediately to be given, yet the\r\nprojections on the lower surface differ greatly in structure and\r\ndevelopment in the males of the several species of Onitis, and are even\r\nrudimentary in some; nevertheless the upper surface in all these species\r\nis quite destitute of horns. As secondary sexual characters are so\r\neminently variable, it is possible that the projections on the lower\r\nsurface may have been first acquired by some progenitor of Onitis and\r\nproduced their effect through compensation, and then have been in\r\ncertain cases almost completely lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Bledius taurus, magnified. Left-hand figure,\r\nmale; right-hand figure, female.]\r\n\r\nAll the cases hitherto given refer to the Lamellicorns, but the males of\r\nsome few other beetles, belonging to two widely distinct groups, namely,\r\nthe Curculionidae and Staphylinidae, are furnished with horns,--in the\r\nformer on the lower surface of the body,[487] in the latter on the upper\r\nsurface of the head and thorax. In the Staphylinidae the horns of the\r\nmales in the same species are extraordinarily variable, just as we have\r\nseen with the Lamellicorns. In Siagonium we have a case of dimorphism,\r\nfor the males can be divided into two sets, differing greatly in the\r\nsize of their bodies, and in the development of their horns, without any\r\nintermediate gradations. In a species of Bledius (fig. 22), also\r\nbelonging to the Staphylinidae, male specimens can be found in the same\r\nlocality, as Professor Westwood states, \"in which the central horn of\r\nthe thorax is very large, but the horns of the head quite rudimental;\r\nand others, in which the thoracic horn is much shorter, whilst the\r\nprotuberances on the head are long.\"[488] Here, then, we apparently have\r\nan instance of compensation of growth, which throws light on the curious\r\ncase just given of the loss of the upper horns by the males of _Onitis\r\nfurcifer_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Law of Battle._--Some male beetles, which seem ill fitted for fighting,\r\nnevertheless engage in conflicts for the possession of the females. Mr.\r\nWallace[489] saw two males of _Leptorhynchus angustatus_, a linear\r\nbeetle with a much elongated rostrum, \"fighting for a female, who stood\r\nclose by busy at her boring. They pushed at each other with their\r\nrostra, and clawed and thumped, apparently in the greatest rage.\" The\r\nsmaller male, however, \"soon ran away, acknowledging himself\r\nvanquished.\" In some few cases the males are well adapted for fighting,\r\nby possessing great toothed mandibles, much larger than those of the\r\nfemales. This is the case with the common stag-beetle (_Lucanus\r\ncervus_), the males of which emerge from the pupal state about a week\r\nbefore the other sex, so that several may often be seen pursuing the\r\nsame female. At this period they engage in fierce conflicts. When Mr. A.\r\nH. Davis[490] enclosed two males with one female in a box, the larger\r\nmale severely pinched the smaller one, until he resigned his\r\npretensions. A friend informs me that when a boy he often put the males\r\ntogether to see them fight, and he noticed that they were much bolder\r\nand fiercer than the females, as is well known to be the case with the\r\nhigher animals. The males would seize hold of his finger, if held in\r\nfront, but not so the females. With many of the Lucanidae, as well as\r\nwith the above-mentioned Leptorhynchus, the males are larger and more\r\npowerful insects than the females. The two sexes of _Lethrus cephalotes_\r\n(one of the Lamellicorns) inhabit the same burrow; and the male has\r\nlarger mandibles than the female. If, during the breeding-season, a\r\nstrange male attempts to enter the burrow, he is attacked; the female\r\ndoes not remain passive, but closes the mouth of the burrow, and\r\nencourages her mate by continually pushing him on from behind. The\r\naction does not cease until the aggressor is killed or runs away.[491]\r\nThe two sexes of another lamellicorn beetle, the _Ateuchus cicatricosus_\r\nlive in pairs, and seem much attached to each other; the male excites\r\nthe female to roll the balls of dung in which the ova are deposited; and\r\nif she is removed, he becomes much agitated. If the male is removed, the\r\nfemale ceases all work, and as M. Brulerie[492] believes, would remain\r\non the spot until she died.\r\n\r\nThe great mandibles of the male Lucanidae are extremely variable both in\r\nsize and structure, and in this respect resemble the horns on the head\r\nand thorax of many male Lamellicorns and Staphylinidae. A perfect series\r\ncan be formed from the best-provided to the worst-provided or degenerate\r\nmales. Although the mandibles of the common stag-beetle, and probably of\r\nmany other species, are used as efficient weapons for fighting, it is\r\ndoubtful whether their great size can thus be accounted for. We have\r\nseen that with the _Lucanus elaphus_ of N. America they are used for\r\nseizing the female. As they are so conspicuous and so elegantly\r\nbranched, the suspicion has sometimes crossed my mind that they may be\r\nserviceable to the males as an ornament, in the same manner as the horns\r\non the head and thorax of the various above described species. The male\r\n_Chiasognathus grantii_ of S. Chile--a splendid beetle belonging to the\r\nsame family--has enormously-developed mandibles (fig. 23); he is bold\r\nand pugnacious; when threatened on any side he faces round, opening his\r\ngreat jaws, and at the same time stridulating loudly; but the mandibles\r\nwere not strong enough to pinch my finger so as to cause actual pain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Chiasognathus grantii, reduced. Upper figure,\r\nmale; lower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nSexual selection, which implies the possession of considerable\r\nperceptive powers and of strong passions, seems to have been more\r\neffective with the Lamellicorns than with any other family of the\r\nColeoptera or beetles. With some species the males are provided with\r\nweapons for fighting; some live in pairs and show mutual affection;\r\nmany have the power of stridulating when excited; many are furnished\r\nwith the most extraordinary horns, apparently for the sake of ornament;\r\nsome which are diurnal in their habits are gorgeously coloured; and,\r\nlastly, several of the largest beetles in the world belong to this\r\nfamily, which was placed by Linnaeus and Fabricius at the head of the\r\nOrder of the Coleoptera.[493]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stridulating organs._--Beetles belonging to many and widely distinct\r\nfamilies possess these organs. The sound can sometimes be heard at the\r\ndistance of several feet or even yards,[494] but is not comparable with\r\nthat produced by the Orthoptera. The part which may be called the rasp\r\ngenerally consists of a narrow slightly-raised surface, crossed by very\r\nfine, parallel ribs, sometimes so fine as to cause iridescent colours,\r\nand having a very elegant appearance under the microscope. In some\r\ncases, for instance, with Typhaeus, it could be plainly seen that\r\nextremely minute, bristly, scale-like prominences, which cover the whole\r\nsurrounding surface in approximately parallel lines, give rise to the\r\nribs of the rasp by becoming confluent and straight, and at the same\r\ntime more prominent and smooth. A hard ridge on any adjoining part of\r\nthe body, which in some cases is specially modified for the purpose,\r\nserves as the scraper for the rasp. The scraper is rapidly moved across\r\nthe rasp, or conversely the rasp across the scraper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Necrophorus (from Landois). _r._ The two rasps.\r\nLeft-hand figure, part of the rasp highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThese organs are situated in widely different positions. In the\r\ncarrion-beetles (Necrophorus) two parallel rasps (_r_, fig. 24) stand on\r\nthe dorsal surface of the fifth abdominal segment, each rasp being\r\ncrossed, as described by Landois,[495] by from 126 to 140 fine ribs.\r\nThese ribs are scraped by the posterior margins of the elytra, a small\r\nportion of which projects beyond the general outline. In many\r\nCrioceridae, and in _Clythra 4-punctata_ (one of the Chrysomelidae), and\r\nin some Tenebrionidae, &c.,[496] the rasp is seated on the dorsal apex of\r\nthe abdomen, on the pygidium or pro-pygidium, and is scraped as above by\r\nthe elytra. In Heterocerus, which belongs to another family, the rasps\r\nare placed on the sides of the first abdominal segment, and are scraped\r\nby ridges on the femora.[497] In certain Curculionidae and Carabidae,[498]\r\nthe parts are completely reversed in position, for the rasps are seated\r\non the inferior surface of the elytra, near their apices, or along their\r\nouter margins, and the edges of the abdominal segments serve as the\r\nscrapers. In _Pelobius hermanni_ (one of Dytiscidae or water-beetles) a\r\nstrong ridge runs parallel and near to the sutural margin of the elytra,\r\nand is crossed by ribs, coarse in the middle part, but becoming\r\ngradually finer at both ends, especially at the upper end; when this\r\ninsect is held under water or in the air, a stridulating noise is\r\nproduced by scraping the extreme horny margin of the abdomen against the\r\nrasp. In a great number of long-horned beetles (Longicornia) the organs\r\nare altogether differently situated, the rasp being on the meso-thorax,\r\nwhich is rubbed against the pro-thorax; Landois counted 238 very fine\r\nribs on the rasp of _Cerambyx heros_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Hind-leg of Geotrupes stercorarius (from\r\nLandois). _r._ Rasp. _c._ Coxa. _f._ Femur. _t._ Tibia. _tr._ Tarsi.]\r\n\r\nMany Lamellicorns have the power of stridulating, and the organs differ\r\ngreatly in position. Some species stridulate very loudly, so that when\r\nMr. F. Smith caught a _Trox sabulosus_, a gamekeeper who stood by\r\nthought that he had caught a mouse; but I failed to discover the proper\r\norgans in this beetle. In Geotrupes and Typhaeus a narrow ridge runs\r\nobliquely across (_r_, fig. 25) the coxa of each hind-leg, having in\r\n_G. stercorarius_ 84 ribs, which are scraped by a specially-projecting\r\npart of one of the abdominal segments. In the nearly allied _Copris\r\nlunaris_, an excessively narrow fine rasp runs along the sutural margin\r\nof the elytra, with another short rasp near the basal outer margin; but\r\nin some other Coprini the rasp is seated, according to Leconte,[499] on\r\nthe dorsal surface of the abdomen. In Oryctes it is seated on the\r\npro-pygidium, and in some other Dynastini, according to the same\r\nentomologist, on the under surface of the elytra. Lastly, Westring\r\nstates that in _Omaloplia brunnea_ the rasp is placed on the\r\npro-sternum, and the scraper on the meta-sternum, the parts thus\r\noccupying the under surface of the body, instead of the upper surface as\r\nin the Longicorns.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the stridulating organs in the different coleopterous\r\nfamilies are wonderfully diversified in position, but not much in\r\nstructure. Within the same family some species are provided with these\r\norgans, and some are quite destitute of them. This diversity is\r\nintelligible, if we suppose that originally various species made a\r\nshuffling or hissing noise by the rubbing together of the hard and rough\r\nparts of their bodies which were in contact; and that from the noise\r\nthus produced being in some way useful, the rough surfaces were\r\ngradually developed into regular stridulating organs. Some beetles as\r\nthey move, now produce, either intentionally or unintentionally, a\r\nshuffling noise, without possessing any proper organs for the purpose.\r\nMr. Wallace informs me that the _Euchirus longimanus_ (a Lamellicorn,\r\nwith the anterior legs wonderfully elongated in the male) \"makes, whilst\r\nmoving, a low hissing sound by the protrusion and contraction of the\r\nabdomen; and when seized it produces a grating sound by rubbing its\r\nhind-legs against the edges of the elytra.\" The hissing sound is clearly\r\ndue to a narrow rasp running along the sutural margin of each elytron;\r\nand I could likewise make the grating sound by rubbing the shagreened\r\nsurface of the femur against the granulated margin of the corresponding\r\nelytron; but I could not here detect any proper rasp; nor is it likely\r\nthat I could have overlooked it in so large an insect. After examining\r\nCychrus and reading what Westring has written in his two papers about\r\nthis beetle, it seems very doubtful whether it possesses any true rasp,\r\nthough it has the power of emitting a sound.\r\n\r\nFrom the analogy of the Orthoptera and Homoptera, I expected to find\r\nthat the stridulating organs in the Coleoptera differed according to\r\nsex; but Landois, who has carefully examined several species, observed\r\nno such difference; nor did Westring; nor did Mr. G. R. Crotch in\r\npreparing the numerous specimens which he had the kindness to send me\r\nfor examination. Any slight sexual difference, however, would be\r\ndifficult to detect, on account of the great variability of these\r\norgans. Thus in the first pair of the _Necrophorus humator_ and of the\r\n_Pelobius_ which I examined, the rasp was considerably larger in the\r\nmale than in the female; but not so with succeeding specimens. In\r\n_Geotrupes stercorarius_ the rasp appeared to me thicker, opaquer, and\r\nmore prominent in three males than in the same number of females;\r\nconsequently my son, Mr. F. Darwin, in order to discover whether the\r\nsexes differed in their power of stridulating, collected 57 living\r\nspecimens, which he separated into two lots, according as they made,\r\nwhen held in the same manner, a greater or lesser noise. He then\r\nexamined their sexes, but found that the males were very nearly in the\r\nsame proportion to the females in both lots. Mr. F. Smith has kept alive\r\nnumerous specimens of _Mononychus pseudacori_ (Curculionidae), and is\r\nsatisfied that both sexes stridulate, and apparently in an equal degree.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the power of stridulating is certainly a sexual character\r\nin some few Coleoptera. Mr. Crotch has discovered that the males alone\r\nof two species of Heliopathes (Tenebrionidae) possess stridulating\r\norgans. I examined five males of _H. gibbus_, and in all these there was\r\na well-developed rasp, partially divided into two, on the dorsal surface\r\nof the terminal abdominal segment; whilst in the same number of females\r\nthere was not even a rudiment of the rasp, the membrane of this segment\r\nbeing transparent and much thinner than in the male. In _H.\r\ncribratostriatus_ the male has a similar rasp, excepting that it is not\r\npartially divided into two portions, and the female is completely\r\ndestitute of this organ; but in addition the male has on the apical\r\nmargins of the elytra, on each side of the suture, three or four short\r\nlongitudinal ridges, which are crossed by extremely fine ribs, parallel\r\nto and resembling those on the abdominal rasp; whether these ridges\r\nserve as an independent rasp, or as a scraper for the abdominal rasp, I\r\ncould not decide: the female exhibits no trace of this latter structure.\r\n\r\nAgain, in three species of the Lamellicorn genus Oryctes, we have a\r\nnearly parallel case. In the females of _O. gryphus_ and _nasicornis_\r\nthe ribs on the rasp of the pro-pygidium are less continuous and less\r\ndistinct than in the males; but the chief difference is that the whole\r\nupper surface of this segment, when held in the proper light, is seen to\r\nbe clothed with hairs, which are absent or are represented by\r\nexcessively fine down in the males. It should be noticed that in all\r\nColeoptera the effective part of the rasp is destitute of hairs. In _O.\r\nsenegalensis_ the difference between the sexes is more strongly marked,\r\nand this is best seen when the proper segment is cleaned and viewed as a\r\ntransparent object. In the female the whole surface is covered with\r\nlittle separate crests, bearing spines; whilst in the male these crests\r\nbecome, in proceeding towards the apex, more and more confluent,\r\nregular, and naked; so that three-fourths of the segment is covered with\r\nextremely fine parallel ribs, which are quite absent in the female. In\r\nthe females, however, of all three species of Oryctes, when the abdomen\r\nof a softened specimen is pushed backwards and forwards, a slight\r\ngrating or stridulating sound can be produced.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Heliopathes and Oryctes there can hardly be a doubt\r\nthat the males stridulate in order to call or to excite the females; but\r\nwith most beetles the stridulation apparently serves both sexes as a\r\nmutual call. This view is not rendered improbable from beetles\r\nstridulating under various emotions; we know that birds use their voices\r\nfor many purposes besides singing to their mates. The great\r\nChiasognathus stridulates in anger or defiance; many species do the same\r\nfrom distress or fear, when held so that they cannot escape; Messrs.\r\nWollaston and Crotch were able, by striking the hollow stems of trees in\r\nthe Canary Islands, to discover the presence of beetles belonging to the\r\ngenus Acalles by their stridulation. Lastly the male Ateuchus\r\nstridulates to encourage the female in her work, and from distress when\r\nshe is removed.[500] Some naturalists believe that beetles make this\r\nnoise to frighten away their enemies; but I cannot think that the\r\nquadrupeds and birds which are able to devour the larger beetles with\r\ntheir extremely hard coats, would be frightened by so slight a grating\r\nsound. The belief that the stridulation serves as a sexual call is\r\nsupported by the fact that death-ticks (_Anobium tessellatum_) are well\r\nknown to answer each other's ticking, or, as I have myself observed, a\r\ntapping noise artificially made; and Mr. Doubleday informs me that he\r\nhas twice or thrice observed a female ticking,[501] and in the course of\r\nan hour or two has found her united with a male, and on one occasion\r\nsurrounded by several males. Finally, it seems probable that the two\r\nsexes of many kinds of beetles were at first enabled to find each other\r\nby the slight shuffling noise produced by the rubbing together of the\r\nadjoining parts of their hard bodies; and that as the males or females\r\nwhich made the greatest noise succeeded best in finding partners, the\r\nrugosities on various parts of their bodies were gradually developed by\r\nmeans of sexual selection into true stridulating organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nINSECTS, _continued_.--ORDER LEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Courtship of butterflies--Battles--Ticking noise--Colours\r\n  common to both sexes, or more brilliant in the\r\n  males--Examples--Not due to the direct action of the conditions\r\n  of life--Colours adapted for protection--Colours of\r\n  moths--Display--Perceptive powers of the\r\n  Lepidoptera--Variability--Causes of the difference in colour\r\n  between the males and females--Mimickry, female butterflies\r\n  more brilliantly coloured than the males--Bright colours of\r\n  caterpillars--Summary and concluding remarks on the secondary\r\n  sexual characters of insects--Birds and insects compared.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this great Order the most interesting point for us is the difference\r\nin colour between the sexes of the same species, and between the\r\ndistinct species of the same genus. Nearly the whole of the following\r\nchapter will be devoted to this subject; but I will first make a few\r\nremarks on one or two other points. Several males may often be seen\r\npursuing and crowding round the same female. Their courtship appears to\r\nbe a prolonged affair, for I have frequently watched one or more males\r\npirouetting round a female until I became tired, without seeing the end\r\nof the courtship. Although butterflies are such weak and fragile\r\ncreatures, they are pugnacious, and an Emperor butterfly[502] has been\r\ncaptured with the tips of its wings broken from a conflict with another\r\nmale. Mr. Collingwood in speaking of the frequent battles between the\r\nbutterflies of Borneo says, \"They whirl round each other with the\r\ngreatest rapidity, and appear to be incited by the greatest ferocity.\"\r\nOne case is known of a butterfly, namely the _Ageronia feronia_, which\r\nmakes a noise like that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a\r\nspring catch, and which could be heard at the distance of several yards.\r\nAt Rio de Janeiro this sound was noticed by me, only when two were\r\nchasing each other in an irregular course, so that it is probably made\r\nduring the courtship of the sexes; but I neglected to attend to this\r\npoint.[503]\r\n\r\nEvery one has admired the extreme beauty of many butterflies and of some\r\nmoths; and we are led to ask, how has this beauty been acquired? Have\r\ntheir colours and diversified patterns simply resulted from the direct\r\naction of the physical conditions to which these insects have been\r\nexposed, without any benefit being thus derived? Or have successive\r\nvariations been accumulated and determined either as a protection or for\r\nsome unknown purpose, or that one sex might be rendered attractive to\r\nthe other? And, again, what is the meaning of the colours being widely\r\ndifferent in the males and females of certain species, and alike in the\r\ntwo sexes of other species? Before attempting to answer these questions\r\na body of facts must be given.\r\n\r\nWith most of our English butterflies, both those which are beautiful,\r\nsuch as the admiral, peacock, and painted lady (Vanessae), and those\r\nwhich are plain-coloured, such as the meadow-browns (Hipparchiae), the\r\nsexes are alike. This is also the case with the magnificent Heliconidae\r\nand Danaidae of the tropics. But in certain other tropical groups, and\r\nwith some of our English butterflies, as the purple emperor, orange-tip,\r\n&c. (_Apatura Iris_ and _Anthocharis cardamines_), the sexes differ\r\neither greatly or slightly in colour. No language suffices to describe\r\nthe splendour of the males of some tropical species. Even within the\r\nsame genus we often find species presenting an extraordinary difference\r\nbetween the sexes, whilst others have their sexes closely alike. Thus in\r\nthe South American genus Epicalia, Mr. Bates, to whom I am much indebted\r\nfor most of the following facts and for looking over this whole\r\ndiscussion, informs me that he knows twelve species, the two sexes of\r\nwhich haunt the same stations (and this is not always the case with\r\nbutterflies), and therefore cannot have been differently affected by\r\nexternal conditions[504]. In nine of these species the males rank\r\namongst the most brilliant of all butterflies, and differ so greatly\r\nfrom the comparatively plain females that they were formerly placed in\r\ndistinct genera. The females of these nine species resemble each other\r\nin their general type of coloration, and likewise resemble both sexes in\r\nseveral allied genera, found in various parts of the world. Hence in\r\naccordance with the descent-theory we may infer that these nine species,\r\nand probably all the others of the genus, are descended from an\r\nancestral form which was coloured in nearly the same manner. In the\r\ntenth species the female still retains the same general colouring, but\r\nthe male resembles her, so that he is coloured in a much less gaudy and\r\ncontrasted manner than the males of the previous species. In the\r\neleventh and twelfth species, the females depart from the type of\r\ncolouring which is usual with their sex in this genus, for they are\r\ngaily decorated in nearly the same manner as the males, but in a\r\nsomewhat less degree. Hence in these two species the bright colours of\r\nthe males seem to have been transferred to the females; whilst the male\r\nof the tenth species has either retained or recovered the plain colours\r\nof the female as well as of the parent-form of the genus; the two sexes\r\nbeing thus rendered in both cases, though in an opposite manner, nearly\r\nalike. In the allied genus Eubagis, both sexes of some of the species\r\nare plain-coloured and nearly alike; whilst with the greater number the\r\nmales are decorated with beautiful metallic tints, in a diversified\r\nmanner, and differ much from their females. The females throughout the\r\ngenus retain the same general style of colouring, so that they commonly\r\nresemble each other much more closely than they resemble their own\r\nproper males.\r\n\r\nIn the genus Papilio, all the species of the AEneas group are remarkable\r\nfor their conspicuous and strongly contrasted colours, and they\r\nillustrate the frequent tendency to gradation in the amount of\r\ndifference between the sexes. In a few species, for instance in _P.\r\nascanius_, the males and females are alike; in others the males are a\r\nlittle or very much more superbly coloured than the females. The genus\r\nJunonia allied to our Vanessae offers a nearly parallel case, for\r\nalthough the sexes of most of the species resemble each other and are\r\ndestitute of rich colours, yet in certain species, as in _J. oenone_,\r\nthe male is rather more brightly coloured than the female, and in a few\r\n(for instance _J. andremiaja_) the male is so different from the female\r\nthat he might be mistaken for an entirely distinct species.\r\n\r\nAnother striking case was pointed out to me in the British museum by Mr.\r\nA. Butler, namely one of the Tropical American Theclae, in which both\r\nsexes are nearly alike and wonderfully splendid; in another, the male\r\nis coloured in a similarly gorgeous manner, whilst the whole upper\r\nsurface of the female is of a dull uniform brown. Our common little\r\nEnglish blue butterflies of the genus Lycaena, illustrate the various\r\ndifferences in colour between the sexes, almost as well, though not in\r\nso striking a manner, as the above exotic genera. In _Lycaena agestis_\r\nboth sexes have wings of a brown colour, bordered with small ocellated\r\norange spots, and are consequently alike. In _L. oegon_ the wings of\r\nthe male are of a fine blue, bordered with black; whilst the wings of\r\nthe female are brown, with a similar border, and closely resemble those\r\nof _L. agestis_. Lastly, in _L. arion_ both sexes are of a blue colour\r\nand nearly alike, though in the female the edges of the wings are rather\r\nduskier, with the black spots plainer; and in a bright blue Indian\r\nspecies both sexes are still more closely alike.\r\n\r\nI have given the foregoing cases in some detail in order to shew, in the\r\nfirst place, that when the sexes of butterflies differ, the male as a\r\ngeneral rule is the most beautiful, and departs most from the usual type\r\nof colouring of the group to which the species belongs. Hence in most\r\ngroups the females of the several species resemble each other much more\r\nclosely than do the males. In some exceptional cases, however, to which\r\nI shall hereafter allude, the females are coloured more splendidly than\r\nthe males. In the second place these cases have been given to bring\r\nclearly before the mind that within the same genus, the two sexes\r\nfrequently present every gradation from no difference in colour to so\r\ngreat a difference that it was long before the two were placed by\r\nentomologists in the same genus. In the third place, we have seen that\r\nwhen the sexes nearly resemble each other, this apparently may be due\r\neither to the male having transferred his colours to the female, or to\r\nthe male having retained, or perhaps recovered, the primordial colours\r\nof the genus to which the species belongs. It also deserves notice that\r\nin those groups in which the sexes present any difference of colour, the\r\nfemales usually resemble the males to a certain extent, so that when the\r\nmales are beautiful to an extraordinary degree, the females almost\r\ninvariably exhibit some degree of beauty. From the numerous cases of\r\ngradation in the amount of difference between the sexes, and from the\r\nprevalence of the same general type of coloration throughout the whole\r\nof the same group, we may conclude that the causes, whatever they may\r\nbe, which have determined the brilliant colouring of the males alone of\r\nsome species, and of both sexes in a more or less equal degree of other\r\nspecies, have generally been the same.\r\n\r\nAs so many gorgeous butterflies inhabit the tropics, it has often been\r\nsupposed that they owe their colours to the great heat and moisture of\r\nthese zones; but Mr. Bates[505] has shewn by the comparison of various\r\nclosely-allied groups of insects from the temperate and tropical\r\nregions, that this view cannot be maintained; and the evidence becomes\r\nconclusive when brilliantly-coloured males and plain-coloured females of\r\nthe same species inhabit the same district, feed on the same food, and\r\nfollow exactly the same habits of life. Even when the sexes resemble\r\neach other, we can hardly believe that their brilliant and\r\nbeautifully-arranged colours are the purposeless result of the nature of\r\nthe tissues, and the action of the surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nWith animals of all kinds, whenever colour has been modified for some\r\nspecial purpose, this has been, as far as we can judge, either for\r\nprotection or as an attraction between the sexes. With many species of\r\nbutterflies the upper surfaces of the wings are obscurely coloured, and\r\nthis in all probability leads to their escaping observation and danger.\r\nBut butterflies when at rest would be particularly liable to be attacked\r\nby their enemies; and almost all the kinds when resting raise their\r\nwings vertically over their backs, so that the lower sides alone are\r\nexposed to view. Hence it is this side which in many cases is obviously\r\ncoloured so as to imitate the surfaces on which these insects commonly\r\nrest. Dr. Roessler, I believe, first noticed the similarity of the closed\r\nwings of certain Vanessae and other butterflies to the bark of trees.\r\nMany analogous and striking facts could be given. The most interesting\r\none is that recorded by Mr. Wallace[506] of a common Indian and Sumatran\r\nbutterfly (Kallima), which disappears like magic when it settles in a\r\nbush; for it hides its head and antennae between its closed wings, and\r\nthese in form, colour, and veining cannot be distinguished from a\r\nwithered leaf together with the footstalk. In some other cases the lower\r\nsurfaces of the wings are brilliantly coloured, and yet are protective;\r\nthus in _Thecla rubi_ the wings when closed are of an emerald green and\r\nresemble the young leaves of the bramble, on which this butterfly in the\r\nspring may often be seen seated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the obscure tints of the upper or under surface of many\r\nbutterflies no doubt serve to conceal them, yet we cannot possibly\r\nextend this view to the brilliant and conspicuous colours of many kinds,\r\nsuch as our admiral and peacock Vanessae, our white cabbage-butterflies\r\n(Pieris), or the great swallow-tail Papilio which haunts the open\r\nfens--for these butterflies are thus rendered visible to every living\r\ncreature. With these species both sexes are alike; but in the common\r\nbrimstone butterfly (_Gonepteryx rhamni_), the male is of an intense\r\nyellow, whilst the female is much paler; and in the orange-tip\r\n(_Anthocharis cardamines_) the males alone have the bright orange tips\r\nto their wings. In these cases the males and females are equally\r\nconspicuous, and it is not credible that their difference in colour\r\nstands in any relation to ordinary protection. Nevertheless it is\r\npossible that the conspicuous colours of many species may be in an\r\nindirect manner beneficial, as will hereafter be explained, by leading\r\ntheir enemies at once to recognise them as unpalatable. Even in this\r\ncase it does not certainly follow that their bright colours and\r\nbeautiful patterns were acquired for this special purpose. In some other\r\nremarkable cases, beauty has been gained for the sake of protection,\r\nthrough the imitation of other beautiful species, which inhabit the same\r\ndistrict and enjoy an immunity from attack by being in some way\r\noffensive to their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe female of our orange-tip butterfly, above referred to, and of an\r\nAmerican species (_Anth. genutia_) probably shew us, as Mr. Walsh has\r\nremarked to me, the primordial colours of the parent-species of the\r\ngenus; for both sexes of four or five widely-distributed species are\r\ncoloured in nearly the same manner. We may infer here, as in several\r\nprevious cases, that it is the males of _Anth. cardamines_ and _genutia_\r\nwhich have departed from the usual type of colouring of their genus. In\r\nthe _Anth. sara_ from California, the orange-tips have become partially\r\ndeveloped in the female; for her wings are tipped with reddish-orange,\r\nbut paler than in the male, and slightly different in some other\r\nrespects. In an allied Indian form, the _Iphias glaucippe_, the\r\norange-tips are fully developed in both sexes. In this Iphias the under\r\nsurface of the wings marvellously resembles, as pointed out to me by Mr.\r\nA. Butler, a pale-coloured leaf; and in our English orange-tip, the\r\nunder surface resembles the flower-head of the wild parsley, on which it\r\nmay be seen going to rest at night.[507] The same reasoning power which\r\ncompels us to believe that the lower surfaces have here been coloured\r\nfor the sake of protection, leads us to deny that the wings have been\r\ntipped, especially when this character is confined to the males, with\r\nbright orange for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning now to Moths: most of these rest motionless with their wings\r\ndepressed during the whole or greater part of the day; and the upper\r\nsurfaces of their wings are often shaded and coloured in an admirable\r\nmanner, as Mr. Wallace has remarked, for escaping detection. With most\r\nof the Bombycidae and Noctuidae,[508] when at rest, the front-wings\r\noverlap and conceal the hind-wings; so that the latter might be brightly\r\ncoloured without much risk; and they are thus coloured in many species\r\nof both families. During the act of flight, moths would often be able to\r\nescape from their enemies; nevertheless, as the hind-wings are then\r\nfully exposed to view, their bright colours must generally have been\r\nacquired at the cost of some little risk. But the following fact shews\r\nus how cautious we ought to be in drawing conclusions on this head. The\r\ncommon yellow under-wings (Triphaena) often fly about during the day or\r\nearly evening, and are then conspicuous from the colour of their\r\nhind-wings. It would naturally be thought that this would be a source of\r\ndanger; but Mr. J. Jenner Weir believes that it actually serves them as\r\na means of escape, for birds strike at these brightly coloured and\r\nfragile surfaces, instead of at the body. For instance, Mr. Weir turned\r\ninto his aviary a vigorous specimen of _Triphaena pronuba_, which was\r\ninstantly pursued by a robin; but the bird's attention being caught by\r\nthe coloured wings, the moth was not captured until after about fifty\r\nattempts, and small portions of the wings were repeatedly broken off. He\r\ntried the same experiment, in the open air, with a _T. fimbria_ and\r\nswallow; but the large size of this moth probably interfered with its\r\ncapture.[509] We are thus reminded of a statement made by Mr.\r\nWallace,[510] namely, that in the Brazilian forests and Malayan islands,\r\nmany common and highly-decorated butterflies are weak flyers, though\r\nfurnished with a broad expanse of wings; and they \"are often captured\r\nwith pierced and broken wings, as if they had been seized by birds, from\r\nwhich they had escaped: if the wings had been much smaller in proportion\r\nto the body, it seems probable that the insect would more frequently\r\nhave been struck or pierced in a vital part, and thus the increased\r\nexpanse of the wings may have been indirectly beneficial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Display._--The bright colours of butterflies and of some moths are\r\nspecially arranged for display, whether or not they serve in addition as\r\na protection. Bright colours would not be visible during the night; and\r\nthere can be no doubt that moths, taken as a body, are much less gaily\r\ndecorated than butterflies, all of which are diurnal in their habits.\r\nBut the moths in certain families, such as the Zygaenidae, various\r\nSphingidae, Uraniidae, some Arctiidae and Saturniidae, fly about during the\r\nday or early evening, and many of these are extremely beautiful, being\r\nfar more brightly coloured than the strictly nocturnal kinds. A few\r\nexceptional cases, however, of brightly-coloured nocturnal species have\r\nbeen recorded.[511]\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of another kind in regard to display. Butterflies, as\r\nbefore remarked, elevate their wings when at rest, and whilst basking in\r\nthe sunshine often alternately raise and depress them, thus exposing to\r\nfull view both surfaces; and although the lower surface is often\r\ncoloured in an obscure manner as a protection, yet in many species it is\r\nas highly coloured as the upper surface, and sometimes in a very\r\ndifferent manner. In some tropical species the lower surface is even\r\nmore brilliantly coloured than the upper.[512] In one English\r\nfritillary, the _Argynnis aglaia_, the lower surface alone is ornamented\r\nwith shining silver discs. Nevertheless, as a general rule, the upper\r\nsurface, which is probably the most fully exposed, is coloured more\r\nbrightly and in a more diversified manner than the lower. Hence the\r\nlower surface generally affords to entomologists the most useful\r\ncharacter for detecting the affinities of the various species.\r\n\r\nNow if we turn to the enormous group of moths, which do not habitually\r\nexpose to full view the under surface of their wings, this side is very\r\nrarely, as I hear from Mr. Stainton, coloured more brightly than the\r\nupper side, or even with equal brightness. Some exceptions to the rule,\r\neither real or apparent, must be noticed, as that of Hypopyra, specified\r\nby Mr. Wormald.[513] Mr. R. Trimen informs me that in Guenee's great\r\nwork, three moths are figured, in which the under surface is much the\r\nmost brilliant. For instance, in the Australian Gastrophora the upper\r\nsurface of the fore-wing is pale greyish-ochreous, while the lower\r\nsurface is magnificently ornamented by an ocellus of cobalt-blue, placed\r\nin the midst of a black mark, surrounded by orange-yellow, and this by\r\nbluish-white. But the habits of these three moths are unknown; so that\r\nno explanation can be given of their unusual style of colouring. Mr.\r\nTrimen also informs me that the lower surface of the wings in certain\r\nother Geometrae[514] and quadrifid Noctuae are either more variegated or\r\nmore brightly-coloured than the upper surface; but some of these species\r\nhave the habit of \"holding their wings quite erect over their backs,\r\nretaining them in this position for a considerable time,\" and thus\r\nexposing to view the under surface. Other species when settled on the\r\nground or herbage have the habit of now and then suddenly and slightly\r\nlifting up their wings. Hence the lower surface of the wings being more\r\nbrightly-coloured than the upper surface in certain moths is not so\r\nanomalous a circumstance as it at first appears. The Saturniidae include\r\nsome of the most beautiful of all moths, their wings being decorated, as\r\nin our British Emperor moth, with fine ocelli; and Mr. T. W. Wood[515]\r\nobserves that they resemble butterflies in some of their movements; \"for\r\ninstance, in the gentle waving up and down of the wings, as if for\r\ndisplay, which is more characteristic of diurnal than of nocturnal\r\nLepidoptera.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that no British moths, nor as far as I can\r\ndiscover hardly any foreign species, which are brilliantly coloured,\r\ndiffer much in colour according to sex; though this is the case with\r\nmany brilliant butterflies. The male, however, of one American moth, the\r\n_Saturnia Io_, is described as having its fore-wings deep yellow,\r\ncuriously marked with purplish-red spots; whilst the wings of the female\r\nare purple-brown, marked with grey lines.[516] The British moths which\r\ndiffer sexually in colour are all brown, or various tints of dull\r\nyellow, or nearly white. In several species the males are much darker\r\nthan the females,[517] and these belong to groups which generally fly\r\nabout during the afternoon. On the other hand, in many genera, as Mr.\r\nStainton informs me, the males have the hind-wings whiter than those of\r\nthe female--of which, fact _Agrotis exclamationis_ offers a good\r\ninstance. The males are thus rendered more conspicuous than the females,\r\nwhilst flying about in the dusk. In the Ghost Moth (_Hepialus humuli_)\r\nthe difference is more strongly marked; the males being white and the\r\nfemales yellow with darker markings. It is difficult to conjecture what\r\nthe meaning can be of these differences between the sexes in the shades\r\nof darkness or lightness; but we can hardly suppose that they are the\r\nresult of mere variability with sexually-limited inheritance,\r\nindependently of any benefit thus derived.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statements it is impossible to admit that the\r\nbrilliant colours of butterflies and of some few moths, have commonly\r\nbeen acquired for the sake of protection. We have seen that their\r\ncolours and elegant patterns are arranged and exhibited as if for\r\ndisplay. Hence I am led to suppose that the females generally prefer, or\r\nare most excited by the more brilliant males; for on any other\r\nsupposition the males would be ornamented, as far as we can see, for no\r\npurpose. We know that ants and certain lamellicorn beetles are capable\r\nof feeling an attachment for each other, and that ants recognise their\r\nfellows after an interval of several months. Hence there is no abstract\r\nimprobability in the Lepidoptera, which probably stand nearly or quite\r\nas high in the scale as these insects, having sufficient mental capacity\r\nto admire bright colours. They certainly discover flowers by colour,\r\nand, as I have elsewhere shewn, the plants which are fertilised\r\nexclusively by the wind never have a conspicuously-coloured corolla. The\r\nHumming-bird Sphinx may often be seen to swoop down from a distance on a\r\nbunch of flowers in the midst of green foliage; and I have been assured\r\nby a friend, that these moths repeatedly visited flowers painted on the\r\nwalls of a room in the South of France. The common white butterfly, as I\r\nhear from Mr. Doubleday, often flies down to a bit of paper on the\r\nground, no doubt mistaking it for one of its own species. Mr.\r\nCollingwood[518] in speaking of the difficulty of collecting certain\r\nbutterflies in the Malay Archipelago, states that \"a dead specimen\r\npinned upon a conspicuous twig will often arrest an insect of the same\r\nspecies in its headlong flight, and bring it down within easy reach of\r\nthe net, especially if it be of the opposite sex.\"\r\n\r\nThe courtship of butterflies is a prolonged affair. The males sometimes\r\nfight together in rivalry; and many may be seen pursuing or crowding\r\nround the same female. If, then, the females do not prefer one male to\r\nanother, the pairing must be left to mere chance, and this does not\r\nappear to me a probable event. If, on the other hand, the females\r\nhabitually, or even occasionally, prefer the more beautiful males, the\r\ncolours of the latter will have been rendered brighter by degrees, and\r\nwill have been transmitted to both sexes or to one sex, according to\r\nwhich law of inheritance prevailed. The process of sexual selection will\r\nhave been much facilitated, if the conclusions arrived at from various\r\nkinds of evidence in the supplement to the ninth chapter can be trusted;\r\nnamely that the males of many Lepidoptera, at least in the imago state,\r\ngreatly exceed in number the females.\r\n\r\nSome facts, however, are opposed to the belief that female butterflies\r\nprefer the more beautiful males; thus, as I have been assured by several\r\nobservers, fresh females may frequently be seen paired with battered,\r\nfaded or dingy males; but this is a circumstance which could hardly\r\nfail often to follow from the males emerging from their cocoons earlier\r\nthan the females. With moths of the family of the Bombycidae, the sexes\r\npair immediately after assuming the imago state; for they cannot feed,\r\nowing to the rudimentary condition of their mouths. The females, as\r\nseveral entomologists have remarked to me, lie in an almost torpid\r\nstate, and appear not to evince the least choice in regard to their\r\npartners, This is the case with the common silk-moth (_B. mori_), as I\r\nhave been told by some continental and English breeders. Dr. Wallace,\r\nwho has had such immense experience in breeding _Bombyx cynthia_, is\r\nconvinced that the females evince no choice or preference. He has kept\r\nabove 300 of these moths living together, and has often found the most\r\nvigorous females mated with stunted males. The reverse apparently seldom\r\noccurs; for, as he believes, the more vigorous males pass over the\r\nweakly females, being attracted by those endowed with most vitality.\r\nAlthough we have been indirectly induced to believe that the females of\r\nmany species prefer the more beautiful males, I have no reason to\r\nsuspect, either with moths or butterflies, that the males are attracted\r\nby the beauty of the females. If the more beautiful females had been\r\ncontinually preferred, it is almost certain, from the colours of\r\nbutterflies being so frequently transmitted to one sex alone, that the\r\nfemales would often have been rendered more beautiful than their male\r\npartners. But this does not occur except in a few instances; and these\r\ncan be explained, as we shall presently see, on the principle of\r\nmimickry and protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs sexual selection primarily depends on variability, a few words must\r\nbe added on this subject. In respect to colour there is no difficulty,\r\nas any number of highly variable Lepidoptera could be named. One good\r\ninstance will suffice. Mr. Bates shewed me a whole series of specimens\r\nof _Papilio sesostris_ and _childrenae_; in the latter the males varied\r\nmuch in the extent of the beautifully enamelled green patch on the\r\nfore-wings, and in the size of the white mark, as well as of the\r\nsplendid crimson stripe on the hind-wings; so that there was a great\r\ncontrast between the most and least gaudy males. The male of _Papilio\r\nsesostris_, though a beautiful insect, is much less so than _P.\r\nchildrenae_. It likewise varies a little in the size of the green patch\r\non the fore-wings, and in the occasional appearance of a small crimson\r\nstripe on the hind-wings, borrowed, as it would seem, from its own\r\nfemale; for the females of this and of many other species in the AEneas\r\ngroup possess this crimson stripe. Hence between the brightest specimens\r\nof _P. sesostris_ and the least bright of _P. childrenae_, there was but\r\na small interval; and it was evident that as far as mere variability is\r\nconcerned, there would be no difficulty in permanently increasing by\r\nmeans of selection the beauty of either species. The variability is here\r\nalmost confined to the male sex; but Mr. Wallace and Mr. Bates have\r\nshewn[519] that the females of some other species are extremely\r\nvariable, the males being nearly constant. As I have before mentioned\r\nthe Ghost Moth (_Hepialus humuli_) as one of the best instances in\r\nBritain of a difference in colour between the sexes of moths, it may be\r\nworth adding[520] that in the Shetland Islands, males are frequently\r\nfound which closely resemble the females. In a future chapter I shall\r\nhave occasion to shew that the beautiful eye-like spots or ocelli, so\r\ncommon on the wings of many Lepidoptera, are eminently variable.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the whole, although many serious objections may be urged, it seems\r\nprobable that most of the species of Lepidoptera which are brilliantly\r\ncoloured, owe their colours to sexual selection, excepting in certain\r\ncases, presently to be mentioned, in which conspicuous colours are\r\nbeneficial as a protection. From the ardour of the male throughout the\r\nanimal kingdom, he is generally willing to accept any female; and it is\r\nthe female which usually exerts a choice. Hence if sexual selection has\r\nhere acted, the male, when the sexes differ, ought to be the most\r\nbrilliantly coloured; and this undoubtedly is the ordinary rule. When\r\nthe sexes are brilliantly coloured and resemble each other, the\r\ncharacters acquired by the males appear to have been transmitted to both\r\nsexes. But will this explanation of the similarity and dissimilarity in\r\ncolour between the sexes suffice?\r\n\r\nThe males and females of the same species of butterfly are known[521] in\r\nseveral cases to inhabit different stations, the former commonly basking\r\nin the sunshine, the latter haunting gloomy forests. It is therefore\r\npossible that different conditions of life may have acted directly on\r\nthe two sexes; but this is not probable,[522] as in the adult state they\r\nare exposed during a very short period to different conditions; and the\r\nlarvae of both are exposed to the same conditions. Mr. Wallace believes\r\nthat the less brilliant colours of the female have been specially\r\ngained in all or almost all cases for the sake of protection. On the\r\ncontrary it seems to me more probable that the males alone, in the large\r\nmajority of cases, have acquired their bright colours through sexual\r\nselection, the females having been but little modified. Consequently the\r\nfemales of distinct but allied species ought to resemble each other much\r\nmore closely than do the males of the same species; and this is the\r\ngeneral rule. The females thus approximately show us the primordial\r\ncolouring of the parent-species of the group to which they belong. They\r\nhave, however, almost always been modified to a certain extent by some\r\nof the successive steps of variation, through the accumulation of which\r\nthe males were rendered beautiful, having been transferred to them. The\r\nmales and females of allied though distinct species will also generally\r\nhave been exposed during their prolonged larval state to different\r\nconditions, and may have been thus indirectly affected; though with the\r\nmales any slight change of colour thus caused will often have been\r\ncompletely masked by the brilliant tints gained through sexual\r\nselection. When we treat of Birds, I shall have to discuss the whole\r\nquestion whether the differences in colour between the males and females\r\nhave been in part specially gained by the latter as a protection; so\r\nthat I will here only give unavoidable details.\r\n\r\nIn all cases when the more common form of equal inheritance by both\r\nsexes has prevailed, the selection of bright-coloured males would tend\r\nto make the females bright-coloured; and the selection of dull-coloured\r\nfemales would tend to make the males dull. If both processes were\r\ncarried on simultaneously, they would tend to neutralise each other. As\r\nfar as I can see, it would be extremely difficult to change through\r\nselection the one form of inheritance into the other. But by the\r\nselection of successive variations, which were from the first sexually\r\nlimited in their transmission, there would not be the slightest\r\ndifficulty in giving bright colours to the males alone, and at the same\r\ntime or subsequently, dull colours to the females alone. In this latter\r\nmanner female butterflies and moths may, as I fully admit, have been\r\nrendered inconspicuous for the sake of protection, and widely different\r\nfrom their males.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace[523] has argued with much force in favour of his view that\r\nwhen the sexes differ, the female has been specially modified for the\r\nsake of protection; and that this has been effected by one form of\r\ninheritance, namely, the transmission of characters to both sexes,\r\nhaving been changed through the agency of natural selection into the\r\nother form, namely, transmission to one sex. I was at first strongly\r\ninclined to accept this view; but the more I have studied the various\r\nclasses throughout the animal kingdom, the less probable it has\r\nappeared. Mr. Wallace urges that both sexes of the _Heliconidae_,\r\n_Danaidae_, _Acroeidae_ are equally brilliant because both are protected\r\nfrom the attacks of birds and other enemies, by their offensive odour;\r\nbut that in other groups, which do not possess this immunity, the\r\nfemales have been rendered inconspicuous, from having more need of\r\nprotection than the males. This supposed difference in the \"need of\r\nprotection by the two sexes\" is rather deceptive, and requires some\r\ndiscussion. It is obvious that brightly-coloured individuals, whether\r\nmales or females, would equally attract, and obscurely-coloured\r\nindividuals equally escape, the attention of their enemies. But we are\r\nconcerned with the effects of the destruction or preservation of certain\r\nindividuals of either sex, on the character of the race. With insects,\r\nafter the male has fertilised the female, and after the latter has laid\r\nher eggs, the greater or less immunity from danger of either sex could\r\nnot possibly have any effect on the offspring. Before the sexes have\r\nperformed their proper functions, if they existed in equal numbers and\r\nif they strictly paired (all other circumstances being the same), the\r\npreservation of the males and females would be equally important for the\r\nexistence of the species and for the character of the offspring. But\r\nwith most animals, as is known to be the case with the domestic\r\nsilk-moth, the male can fertilise two or three females; so that the\r\ndestruction of the males would not be so injurious to the species as\r\nthat of the females. On the other hand, Dr. Wallace believes that with\r\nmoths the progeny from a second or third fertilisation is apt to be\r\nweakly, and therefore would not have so good chance of surviving. When\r\nthe males exist in much greater numbers than the females, no doubt many\r\nmales might be destroyed with impunity to the species; but I cannot see\r\nthat the results of ordinary selection for the sake of protection would\r\nbe influenced by the sexes existing in unequal numbers; for the same\r\nproportion of the more conspicuous individuals, whether males or\r\nfemales, would probably be destroyed. If indeed the males presented a\r\ngreater range of variation in colour, the result would be different; but\r\nwe need not here follow out such complex details. On the whole I cannot\r\nperceive that an inequality in the numbers of the two sexes would\r\ninfluence in any marked manner the effects of ordinary selection on the\r\ncharacter of the offspring.\r\n\r\nFemale Lepidoptera require, as Mr. Wallace insists, some days to\r\ndeposit their fertilised ova and to search for a proper place; during\r\nthis period (whilst the life of the male was of no importance) the\r\nbrighter-coloured females would be exposed to danger and would be liable\r\nto be destroyed. The duller-coloured females on the other hand would\r\nsurvive, and thus would influence, it might be thought, in a marked\r\nmanner the character of the species,--either of both sexes or of one\r\nsex, according to which form of inheritance prevailed. But it must not\r\nbe forgotten that the males emerge from the cocoon-state some days\r\nbefore the females, and during this period, whilst the unborn females\r\nwere safe, the brighter-coloured males would be exposed to danger; so\r\nthat ultimately both sexes would probably be exposed during a nearly\r\nequal length of time to danger, and the elimination of conspicuous\r\ncolours would not be much more effective in the one than the other sex.\r\n\r\nIt is a more important consideration that female Lepidoptera, as Mr.\r\nWallace remarks, and as is known to every collector, are generally\r\nslower flyers than the males. Consequently the latter, if exposed to\r\ngreater danger from being conspicuously coloured, might be able to\r\nescape from their enemies, whilst the similarly-coloured females would\r\nbe destroyed; and thus the females would have the most influence in\r\nmodifying the colour of their progeny.\r\n\r\nThere is one other consideration: bright colours, as far as sexual\r\nselection is concerned, are commonly of no service to the females; so\r\nthat if the latter varied in brightness, and the variations were\r\nsexually limited in their transmission, it would depend on mere chance\r\nwhether the females had their bright colours increased; and this would\r\ntend throughout the Order to diminish the number of species with\r\nbrightly-coloured females in comparison with the species having\r\nbrightly-coloured males. On the other hand, as bright colours are\r\nsupposed to be highly serviceable to the males in their love-struggles,\r\nthe brighter males (as we shall see in the chapter on Birds) although\r\nexposed to rather greater danger, would on an average procreate a\r\ngreater number of offspring than the duller males. In this case, if the\r\nvariations were limited in their transmission to the male sex, the males\r\nalone would be rendered more brilliantly coloured; but if the variations\r\nwere not thus limited, the preservation and augmentation of such\r\nvariations would depend on whether more evil was caused to the species\r\nby the females being rendered conspicuous, than good to the males by\r\ncertain individuals being successful over their rivals.\r\n\r\nAs there can hardly be a doubt that both sexes of many butterflies and\r\nmoths have been rendered dull-coloured for the sake of protection, so\r\nit may have been with the females alone of some species in which\r\nsuccessive variations towards dullness first appeared in the female sex\r\nand were from the first limited in their transmission to the same sex.\r\nIf not thus limited, both sexes would become dull-coloured. We shall\r\nimmediately see, when we treat of mimickry, that the females alone of\r\ncertain butterflies have been rendered extremely beautiful for the sake\r\nof protection, without any of the successive protective variations\r\nhaving been transferred to the male, to whom they could not possibly\r\nhave been in the least degree injurious, and therefore could not have\r\nbeen eliminated through natural selection. Whether in each particular\r\nspecies, in which the sexes differ in colour, it is the female which has\r\nbeen specially modified for the sake of protection; or whether it is the\r\nmale which has been specially modified for the sake of sexual\r\nattraction, the female having retained her primordial colouring only\r\nslightly changed through the agencies before alluded to; or whether\r\nagain both sexes have been modified, the female for protection and the\r\nmale for sexual attraction, can only be definitely decided when we know\r\nthe life-history of each species.\r\n\r\nWithout distinct evidence, I am unwilling to admit that a double process\r\nof selection has long been going on with a multitude of species,--the\r\nmales having been rendered more brilliant by beating their rivals; and\r\nthe females more dull-coloured by having escaped from their enemies. We\r\nmay take as an instance the common brimstone butterfly (Gonepteryx),\r\nwhich appears early in the spring before any other kind. The male of\r\nthis species is of a far more intense yellow than the female, though she\r\nis almost equally conspicuous; and in this case it does not seem\r\nprobable that she specially acquired her pale tints as a protection,\r\nthough it is probable that the male acquired his bright colours as a\r\nsexual attraction. The female of _Anthocharis cardamines_ does not\r\npossess the beautiful orange tips to her wings with which the male is\r\nornamented; consequently she closely resembles the white butterflies\r\n(Pieris) so common in our gardens; but we have no evidence that this\r\nresemblance is beneficial. On the contrary, as she resembles both sexes\r\nof several species of the same genus inhabiting various quarters of the\r\nworld, it is more probable that she has simply retained to a large\r\nextent her primordial colours.\r\n\r\nVarious facts support the conclusion that with the greater number of\r\nbrilliantly-coloured Lepidoptera, it is the male which has been\r\nmodified; the two sexes having come to differ from each other, or to\r\nresemble each other, according to which form of inheritance has\r\nprevailed. Inheritance is governed by so many unknown laws or\r\nconditions, that they seem to us to be most capricious in their\r\naction;[524] and we can so far understand how it is that with\r\nclosely-allied species the sexes of some differ to an astonishing\r\ndegree, whilst the sexes of others are identical in colour. As the\r\nsuccessive steps in the process of variation are necessarily all\r\ntransmitted through the female, a greater or less number of such steps\r\nmight readily become developed in her; and thus we can understand the\r\nfrequent gradations from an extreme difference to no difference at all\r\nbetween the sexes of the species within the same group. These cases of\r\ngradation are much too common to favour the supposition that we here see\r\nfemales actually undergoing the process of transition and losing their\r\nbrightness for the sake of protection; for we have every reason to\r\nconclude that at any one time the greater number of species are in a\r\nfixed condition. With respect to the differences between the females of\r\nthe species in the same genus or family, we can perceive that they\r\ndepend, at least in part, on the females partaking of the colours of\r\ntheir respective males. This is well illustrated in those groups in\r\nwhich the males are ornamented to an extraordinary degree; for the\r\nfemales in these groups generally partake to a certain extent of the\r\nsplendour of their male partners. Lastly, we continually find, as\r\nalready remarked, that the females of almost all the species in the same\r\ngenus, or even family, resemble each other much more closely in colour\r\nthan do the males; and this indicates that the males have undergone a\r\ngreater amount of modification than the females.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimickry._--This principle was first made clear in an admirable paper\r\nby Mr. Bates,[525] who thus threw a flood of light on many obscure\r\nproblems. It had previously been observed that certain butterflies in S.\r\nAmerica belonging to quite distinct families, resembled the Heliconidae\r\nso closely in every stripe and shade of colour that they could not be\r\ndistinguished except by an experienced entomologist. As the Heliconidae\r\nare coloured in their usual manner, whilst the others depart from the\r\nusual colouring of the groups to which they belong, it is clear that the\r\nlatter are the imitators, and the Heliconidae the imitated. Mr. Bates\r\nfurther observed that the imitating species are comparatively rare,\r\nwhilst the imitated swarm in large numbers; the two sets living mingled\r\ntogether. From the fact of the Heliconidae being conspicuous and\r\nbeautiful insects, yet so numerous in individuals and species, he\r\nconcluded that they must be protected from the attacks of birds by some\r\nsecretion or odour; and this hypothesis has now been confirmed by a\r\nconsiderable body of curious evidence.[526] From these considerations\r\nMr. Bates inferred that the butterflies which imitate the protected\r\nspecies had acquired their present marvellously deceptive appearance,\r\nthrough variation and natural selection, in order to be mistaken for the\r\nprotected kinds and thus to escape being devoured. No explanation is\r\nhere attempted of the brilliant colours of the imitated, but only of the\r\nimitating butterflies. We must account for the colours of the former in\r\nthe same general manner, as in the cases previously discussed in this\r\nchapter. Since the publication of Mr. Bates' paper, similar and equally\r\nstriking facts have been observed by Mr. Wallace[527] in the Malayan\r\nregion, and by Mr. Trimen in South Africa.\r\n\r\nAs some writers[528] have felt much difficulty in understanding how the\r\nfirst steps in the process of mimickry could have been effected through\r\nnatural selection, it may be well to remark that the process probably\r\nhas never commenced with forms widely dissimilar in colour. But with two\r\nspecies moderately like each other, the closest resemblance if\r\nbeneficial to either form could readily be thus gained; and if the\r\nimitated form was subsequently and gradually modified through sexual\r\nselection or any other means, the imitating form would be led along the\r\nsame track, and thus be modified to almost any extent, so that it might\r\nultimately assume an appearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the\r\nother members of the group to which it belonged. As extremely slight\r\nvariations in colour would not in many cases suffice to render a species\r\nso like another protected species as to lead to its preservation, it\r\nshould be remembered that many species of Lepidoptera are liable to\r\nconsiderable and abrupt variations in colour. A few instances have been\r\ngiven in this chapter; but under this point of view Mr. Bates' original\r\npaper on mimickry, as well as Mr. Wallace's papers, should be consulted.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases both sexes of the imitating species\r\nresemble the imitated; but occasionally the female alone mocks a\r\nbrilliantly-coloured and protected species inhabiting the same district.\r\nConsequently the female differs in colour from her own male, and, which\r\nis a rare and anomalous circumstance, is the more brightly-coloured of\r\nthe two. In all the few species of Pieridae, in which the female is more\r\nconspicuously coloured than the male, she imitates, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Wallace, some protected species inhabiting the same region. The\r\nfemale of _Diadema anomala_ is rich purple-brown with almost the whole\r\nsurface glossed with satiny blue, and she closely imitates the\r\n_Euploea midamus_, \"one of the commonest butterflies of the East;\"\r\nwhilst the male is bronzy or olive-brown, with only a slight blue gloss\r\non the outer parts of the wings.[529] Both sexes of this Diadema and of\r\n_D. bolina_ follow the same habits of life, so that the differences in\r\ncolour between the sexes cannot be accounted for by exposure to\r\ndifferent conditions;[530] even if this explanation were admissible in\r\nother instances.[531]\r\n\r\nThe above cases of female butterflies which are more brightly-coloured\r\nthan the males, shew us, firstly, that variations have arisen in a state\r\nof nature in the female sex, and have been transmitted exclusively, or\r\nalmost exclusively, to the same sex; and, secondly, that this form of\r\ninheritance has not been determined through natural selection. For if we\r\nassume that the females, before they became brightly coloured in\r\nimitation of some protected kind, were exposed during each season for a\r\nlonger period to danger than the males; or if we assume that they could\r\nnot escape so swiftly from their enemies, we can understand how they\r\nalone might originally have acquired through natural selection and\r\nsexually-limited inheritance their present protective colours. But\r\nexcept on the principle of these variations having been transmitted\r\nexclusively to the female offspring, we cannot understand why the males\r\nshould have remained dull-coloured; for it would surely not have been in\r\nany way injurious to each individual male to have partaken by\r\ninheritance of the protective colours of the female, and thus to have\r\nhad a better chance of escaping destruction. In a group in which\r\nbrilliant colours are so common as with butterflies, it cannot be\r\nsupposed that the males have been kept dull-coloured through sexual\r\nselection by the females rejecting the individuals which were rendered\r\nas beautiful as themselves. We may, therefore, conclude that in these\r\ncases inheritance by one sex is not due to the modification through\r\nnatural selection of a tendency to equal inheritance by both sexes.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to give an analogous case in another Order, of\r\ncharacters acquired only by the female, though not in the least\r\ninjurious, as far as we can judge, to the male. Amongst the Phasmidae, or\r\nspectre-insects, Mr. Wallace states that \"it is often the females alone\r\nthat so strikingly resemble leaves, while the males show only a rude\r\napproximation.\" Now, whatever may be the habits of these insects, it is\r\nhighly improbable that it could be disadvantageous to the males to\r\nescape detection by resembling leaves.[532] Hence we may conclude that\r\nthe females alone in this latter as in the previous cases originally\r\nvaried in certain characters; these characters having been preserved and\r\naugmented through ordinary selection for the sake of protection and from\r\nthe first transmitted to the female offspring alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bright Colours of Caterpillars._--Whilst reflecting on the beauty of\r\nmany butterflies, it occurred to me that some caterpillars were\r\nsplendidly coloured, and as sexual selection could not possibly have\r\nhere acted, it appeared rash to attribute the beauty of the mature\r\ninsect to this agency, unless the bright colours of their larvae could\r\nbe in some manner explained. In the first place it may be observed that\r\nthe colours of caterpillars do not stand in any close correlation with\r\nthose of the mature insect. Secondly, their bright colours do not serve\r\nin any ordinary manner as a protection. As an instance of this, Mr.\r\nBates informs me that the most conspicuous caterpillar which he ever\r\nbeheld (that of a Sphinx) lived on the large green leaves of a tree on\r\nthe open llanos of South America; it was about four inches in length,\r\ntransversely banded with black and yellow, and with its head, legs, and\r\ntail of a bright red. Hence it caught the eye of any man who passed by\r\nat the distance of many yards, and no doubt of every passing bird.\r\n\r\nI then applied to Mr. Wallace, who has an innate genius for solving\r\ndifficulties. After some consideration he replied: \"Most caterpillars\r\nrequire protection, as may be inferred from some kinds being furnished\r\nwith spines or irritating hairs, and from many being coloured green like\r\nthe leaves on which they feed, or curiously like the twigs of the trees\r\non which they live.\" I may add as another instance of protection, that\r\nthere is a caterpillar of a moth, as I am informed by Mr. J. Mansel\r\nWeale, which lives on the mimosas in South Africa, and fabricates for\r\nitself a case, quite undistinguishable from the surrounding thorns. From\r\nsuch considerations Mr. Wallace thought it probable that\r\nconspicuously-coloured caterpillars were protected by having a nauseous\r\ntaste; but as their skin is extremely tender, and as their intestines\r\nreadily protrude from a wound, a slight peck from the beak of a bird\r\nwould be as fatal to them as if they had been devoured. Hence, as Mr.\r\nWallace remarks, \"distastefulness alone would be insufficient to protect\r\na caterpillar unless some outward sign indicated to its would-be\r\ndestroyer that its prey was a disgusting morsel.\" Under these\r\ncircumstances it would be highly advantageous to a caterpillar to be\r\ninstantaneously and certainly recognised as unpalatable by all birds and\r\nother animals. Thus the most gaudy colours would be serviceable, and\r\nmight have been gained by variation and the survival of the most\r\neasily-recognised individuals.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis appears at first sight very bold; but when it was\r\nbrought before the Entomological Society[533] it was supported by\r\nvarious statements; and Mr. J. Jenner Weir, who keeps a large number of\r\nbirds in an aviary, has made, as he informs me, numerous trials, and\r\nfinds no exception to the rule, that all caterpillars of nocturnal and\r\nretiring habits with smooth skins, all of a green colour, and all which\r\nimitate twigs, are greedily devoured by his birds. The hairy and spinose\r\nkinds are invariably rejected, as were four conspicuously-coloured\r\nspecies. When the birds rejected a caterpillar, they plainly shewed, by\r\nshaking their heads and cleansing their beaks, that they were disgusted\r\nby the taste.[534] Three conspicuous kinds of caterpillars and moths\r\nwere also given by Mr. A. Butler to some lizards and frogs, and were\r\nrejected; though other kinds were eagerly eaten. Thus the probable truth\r\nof Mr. Wallace's view is confirmed, namely, that certain caterpillars\r\nhave been made conspicuous for their own good, so as to be easily\r\nrecognised by their enemies, on nearly the same principle that certain\r\npoisons are coloured by druggists for the good of man. This view will,\r\nit is probable, be hereafter extended to many animals, which are\r\ncoloured in a conspicuous manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary and Concluding Remarks on Insects._--Looking back to the\r\nseveral Orders, we have seen that the sexes often differ in various\r\ncharacters, the meaning of which is not understood. The sexes, also,\r\noften differ in their organs of sense or locomotion, so that the males\r\nmay quickly discover or reach the females, and still oftener in the\r\nmales possessing diversified contrivances for retaining the females when\r\nfound. But we are not here much concerned with sexual differences of\r\nthese kinds.\r\n\r\nIn almost all the Orders, the males of some species, even of weak and\r\ndelicate kinds, are known to be highly pugnacious; and some few are\r\nfurnished with special weapons for fighting with their rivals. But the\r\nlaw of battle does not prevail nearly so widely with insects as with the\r\nhigher animals. Hence probably it is that the males have not often been\r\nrendered larger and stronger than the females. On the contrary they are\r\nusually smaller, in order that they may be developed within a shorter\r\ntime, so as to be ready in large numbers for the emergence of the\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nIn two families of the Homoptera the males alone possess, in an\r\nefficient state, organs which may be called vocal; and in three families\r\nof the Orthoptera the males alone possess stridulating organs. In both\r\ncases these organs are incessantly used during the breeding-season, not\r\nonly for calling the females, but for charming or exciting them in\r\nrivalry with other males. No one who admits the agency of natural\r\nselection, will dispute that these musical instruments have been\r\nacquired through sexual selection. In four other Orders the members of\r\none sex, or more commonly of both sexes, are provided with organs for\r\nproducing various sounds, which apparently serve merely as call-notes.\r\nEven when both sexes are thus provided, the individuals which were able\r\nto make the loudest or most continuous noise would gain partners before\r\nthose which were less noisy, so that their organs have probably been\r\ngained through sexual selection. It is instructive to reflect on the\r\nwonderful diversity of the means for producing sound, possessed by the\r\nmales alone or by both sexes in no less than six Orders, and which were\r\npossessed by at least one insect at an extremely remote geological\r\nepoch. We thus learn how effectual sexual selection has been in leading\r\nto modifications of structure, which sometimes, as with the Homoptera,\r\nare of an important nature.\r\n\r\nFrom the reasons assigned in the last chapter, it is probable that the\r\ngreat horns of the males of many lamellicorn, and some other beetles,\r\nhave been acquired as ornaments. So perhaps it may be with certain other\r\npeculiarities confined to the male sex. From the small size of insects,\r\nwe are apt to undervalue their appearance. If we could imagine a male\r\nChalcosoma (fig. 15) with its polished, bronzed coat of mail, and vast\r\ncomplex horns, magnified to the size of a horse or even of a dog, it\r\nwould be one of the most imposing animals in the world.\r\n\r\nThe colouring of insects is a complex and obscure subject. When the male\r\ndiffers slightly from the female, and neither are brilliantly coloured,\r\nit is probable that the two sexes have varied in a slightly different\r\nmanner, with the variations transmitted to the same sex, without any\r\nbenefit having been thus derived or evil suffered. When the male is\r\nbrilliantly coloured and differs conspicuously from the female, as with\r\nsome dragon-flies and many butterflies, it is probable that he alone has\r\nbeen modified, and that he owes his colours to sexual selection; whilst\r\nthe female has retained a primordial or very ancient type of colouring,\r\nslightly modified by the agencies before explained, and has therefore\r\nnot been rendered obscure, at least in most cases, for the sake of\r\nprotection. But the female alone has sometimes been coloured\r\nbrilliantly so as to imitate other protected species inhabiting the same\r\ndistrict. When the sexes resemble each other and both are obscurely\r\ncoloured, there is no doubt that they have been in a multitude of cases\r\ncoloured for the sake of protection. So it is in some instances when\r\nboth are brightly coloured, causing them to resemble surrounding objects\r\nsuch as flowers, or other protected species, or indirectly by giving\r\nnotice to their enemies that they are of an unpalatable nature. In many\r\nother cases in which the sexes resemble each other and are brilliantly\r\ncoloured, especially when the colours are arranged for display, we may\r\nconclude that they have been gained by the male sex as an attraction,\r\nand have been transferred to both sexes. We are more especially led to\r\nthis conclusion whenever the same type of coloration prevails throughout\r\na group, and we find that the males of some species differ widely in\r\ncolour from the females, whilst both sexes of other species are quite\r\nalike, with intermediate gradations connecting these extreme states.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as bright colours have often been partially\r\ntransferred from the males to the females, so it has been with the\r\nextraordinary horns of many lamellicorn and some other beetles. So,\r\nagain, the vocal or instrumental organs proper to the males of the\r\nHomoptera and Orthoptera have generally been transferred in a\r\nrudimentary, or even in a nearly perfect condition to the females; yet\r\nnot sufficiently perfect to be used for producing sound. It is also an\r\ninteresting fact, as bearing on sexual selection, that the stridulating\r\norgans of certain male Orthoptera are not fully developed until the last\r\nmoult; and that the colours of certain male dragon-flies are not fully\r\ndeveloped until some little time after their emergence from the pupal\r\nstate, and when they are ready to breed.\r\n\r\nSexual selection implies that the more attractive individuals are\r\npreferred by the opposite sex; and as with insects, when the sexes\r\ndiffer, it is the male which, with rare exceptions, is the most\r\nornamented and departs most from the type to which the species\r\nbelongs;--and as it is the male which searches eagerly for the female,\r\nwe must suppose that the females habitually or occasionally prefer the\r\nmore beautiful males, and that these have thus acquired their beauty.\r\nThat in most or all the orders the females have the power of rejecting\r\nany particular male, we may safely infer from the many singular\r\ncontrivances possessed by the males, such as great jaws, adhesive\r\ncushions, spines, elongated legs, &c., for seizing the female; for these\r\ncontrivances shew that there is some difficulty in the act. In the case\r\nof unions between distinct species, of which many instances have been\r\nrecorded, the female must have been a consenting party. Judging from\r\nwhat we know of the perceptive powers and affections of various insects,\r\nthere is no antecedent improbability in sexual selection having come\r\nlargely into action; but we have as yet no direct evidence on this head,\r\nand some facts are opposed to the belief. Nevertheless, when we see many\r\nmales pursuing the same female, we can hardly believe that the pairing\r\nis left to blind chance--that the female exerts no choice, and is not\r\ninfluenced by the gorgeous colours or other ornaments, with which the\r\nmale alone is decorated.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that the females of the Homoptera and Orthoptera appreciate\r\nthe musical tones emitted by their male partners, and that the various\r\ninstruments for this purpose have been perfected through sexual\r\nselection, there is little improbability in the females of other insects\r\nappreciating beauty in form or colour, and consequently in such\r\ncharacters having been thus gained by the males. But from the\r\ncircumstance of colour being so variable, and from its having been so\r\noften modified for the sake of protection, it is extremely difficult to\r\ndecide in how large a proportion of cases sexual selection has come into\r\nplay. This is more especially difficult in those Orders, such as the\r\nOrthoptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera, in which the two sexes rarely\r\ndiffer much in colour; for we are thus cut off from our best evidence of\r\nsome relation between the reproduction of the species and colour. With\r\nthe Coleoptera, however, as before remarked, it is in the great\r\nlamellicorn group, placed by some authors at the head of the Order, and\r\nin which we sometimes see a mutual attachment between the sexes, that we\r\nfind the males of some species possessing weapons for sexual strife,\r\nothers furnished with wonderful horns, many with stridulating organs,\r\nand others ornamented with splendid metallic tints. Hence it seems\r\nprobable that all these characters have been gained through the same\r\nmeans, namely sexual selection.\r\n\r\nWhen we treat of Birds, we shall see that they present in their\r\nsecondary sexual characters the closest analogy with insects. Thus, many\r\nmale birds are highly pugnacious, and some are furnished with special\r\nweapons for fighting with their rivals. They possess organs which are\r\nused during the breeding-season for producing vocal and instrumental\r\nmusic. They are frequently ornamented with combs, horns, wattles and\r\nplumes of the most diversified kinds, and are decorated with beautiful\r\ncolours, all evidently for the sake of display. We shall find that, as\r\nwith insects, both sexes, in certain groups, are equally beautiful, and\r\nare equally provided with ornaments which are usually confined to the\r\nmale sex. In other groups both sexes are equally plain-coloured and\r\nunornamented. Lastly, in some few anomalous cases, the females are more\r\nbeautiful than the males. We shall often find, in the same group of\r\nbirds, every gradation from no difference between the sexes, to an\r\nextreme difference. In the latter case we shall see that the females,\r\nlike female insects, often possess more or less plain traces of the\r\ncharacters which properly belong to the males. The analogy, indeed, in\r\nall these respects between birds and insects, is curiously close.\r\nWhatever explanation applies to the one class probably applies to the\r\nother; and this explanation, as we shall hereafter attempt to shew, is\r\nalmost certainly sexual selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] As the works of the first-named authors are so well known,\r\n  I need not give the titles; but as those of the latter are less\r\n  well known in England, I will give them:--'Sechs Vorlesungen\r\n  ueber die Darwin'sche Theorie:' zweite Auflage, 1868, von Dr. L.\r\n  Buechner; translated into French under the title 'Conferences\r\n  sur la Theorie Darwinienne,' 1869.

See also\r\n  the three striking chapters on the Development of Religion, in\r\n  Lubbock's 'Origin of Civilisation,' 1870. In a like manner Mr.\r\n  Herbert Spencer, in his ingenious essay in the 'Fortnightly\r\n  Review' (May 1st, 1870, p. 535), accounts for the earliest\r\n  forms of religious belief throughout the world, by man being\r\n  led through dreams, shadows, and other causes, to look at\r\n  himself as a double essence, corporeal and spiritual. As the\r\n  spiritual being is supposed to exist after death and to be\r\n  powerful, it is propitiated by various gifts and ceremonies,\r\n  and its aid invoked. He then further shews that names or\r\n  nicknames given from some animal or other object to the early\r\n  progenitors or founders of a tribe, are supposed after a long\r\n  interval to represent the real progenitor of the tribe; and\r\n  such animal or object is then naturally believed still to exist\r\n  as a spirit, is held sacred, and worshipped as a god.\r\n  Nevertheless I cannot but suspect that there is a still earlier\r\n  and ruder stage, when anything which manifests power or\r\n  movement is thought to be endowed with some form of life, and\r\n  with mental faculties analogous to our own.\r\n\r\n  [98] See an able article on the Psychical Elements of Religion,\r\n  by Mr. L.

In this work (at\r\n  p. 553) there will be found an excellent account of the many\r\n  strange and capricious customs of savages.\r\n\r\n  [101] See, for instance, on this subject, Quatrefages, 'Unite\r\n  de l'Espece Humaine,' 1861, p. 21, &c.\r\n\r\n  [102] 'Dissertation on Ethical Philosophy,' 1837, p. 231, &c.\r\n\r\n  [103] 'Metaphysics of Ethics,' translated by J. W. Semple,\r\n  Edinburgh, 1836, p. 136.\r\n\r\n  [104] Mr. Bain gives a list ('Mental and Moral Science,' 1868,\r\n  p. 543-725) of twenty-six British authors who have written on\r\n  this subject, and whose names are familiar to every reader; to\r\n  these, Mr. Bain's own name, and those of Mr. Lecky, Mr.\r\n  Shadworth Hodgson, and Sir J. Lubbock, as well as of others,\r\n  may be added.\r\n\r\n  [105] Sir B. Brodie, after observing that man is a social\r\n  animal ('Psychological Enquiries,' 1854, p. 192), asks the\r\n  pregnant question, \"ought not this to settle the disputed\r\n  question as to the existence of a moral sense?\" Similar ideas\r\n  have probably occurred to many persons, as they did long ago to\r\n  Marcus Aurelius. Mr. J. S. Mill speaks, in his celebrated work,\r\n  'Utilitarianism,' (1864, p. 46), of the social feelings as a\r\n  \"powerful natural sentiment,\" and as \"the natural basis of\r\n  sentiment for utilitarian morality;\" but on the previous page\r\n  he says, \"if, as is my own belief, the moral feelings are not\r\n  innate, but acquired, they are not for that reason less\r\n  natural.\" It is with hesitation that I venture to differ from\r\n  so profound a thinker, but it can hardly be disputed that the\r\n  social feelings are instinctive or innate in the lower animals;\r\n  and why should they not be so in man? Mr. Bain (see, for\r\n  instance, 'The Emotions and the Will,' 1865, p. 481) and others\r\n  believe that the moral sense is acquired by each individual\r\n  during his lifetime. On the general theory of evolution this is\r\n  at least extremely improbable.\r\n\r\n  [106] 'Die Darwin'sche Theorie,' s. 101.\r\n\r\n  [107] Mr. R. Brown in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1868, p. 409.\r\n\r\n  [108] Brehm, 'Thierleben,' B. i. 1864, s. 52, 79.

For the cases of the old male\r\n  baboons attacking the dogs, see s. 79; and with respect to the\r\n  eagle, s. 56.\r\n\r\n  [109] 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' November, 1868, p. 382.\r\n\r\n  [110] Sir J. Lubbock, 'Prehistoric Times,' 2nd edit. p. 446.\r\n\r\n  [111] As quoted by Mr. L. H. Morgan, 'The American Beaver,'\r\n  1868, p. 272. Capt. Stansbury also gives an interesting account\r\n  of the manner in which a very young pelican, carried away by a\r\n  strong stream, was guided and encouraged in its attempts to\r\n  reach the shore by half a dozen old birds.\r\n\r\n  [112] As Mr. Bain states, \"effective aid to a sufferer springs\r\n  from sympathy proper:\" 'Mental and Moral Science,' 1868, p.\r\n  245.\r\n\r\n  [113] 'Thierleben,' B. i. s. 85.\r\n\r\n  [114] 'De l'Espece et de la Class.' 1869, p. 97.\r\n\r\n  [115] 'Der Darwin'schen Art-Lehre,' 1869, s. 54.\r\n\r\n  [116] Brehm, 'Thierleben,' B. i. s. 76.\r\n\r\n  [117] See the first and striking chapter in Adam Smith's\r\n  'Theory of Moral Sentiments.' Also Mr. Bain's 'Mental and Moral\r\n  Science,' 1868, p. 244, and 275-282. Mr. Bain states, that\r\n  \"sympathy is, indirectly, a source of pleasure to the\r\n  sympathiser;\" and he accounts for this through reciprocity. He\r\n  remarks that \"the person benefited, or others in his stead, may\r\n  make up, by sympathy and good offices returned, for all the\r\n  sacrifice.\" But if, as appears to be the case, sympathy is\r\n  strictly an instinct, its exercise would give direct pleasure,\r\n  in the same manner as the exercise, as before remarked, of\r\n  almost every other instinct.\r\n\r\n  [118] This fact, the Rev. L. Jenyns states (see his edition of\r\n  'White's Nat. Hist. of Selborne,' 1853, p. 204) was first\r\n  recorded by the illustrious Jenner, in 'Phil. Transact.' 1824,\r\n  and has since been confirmed by several observers, especially\r\n  by Mr. Blackwall. This latter careful observer examined, late\r\n  in the autumn, during two years, thirty-six nests; he found\r\n  that twelve contained young dead birds, five contained eggs on\r\n  the point of being hatched, and three eggs not nearly hatched.\r\n  Many birds not yet old enough for a prolonged flight are\r\n  likewise deserted and left behind. See Blackwall, 'Researches\r\n  in Zoology,' 1834, pp. 108, 118. For some additional evidence,\r\n  although this is not wanted, see Leroy, 'Lettres Phil.' 1802,\r\n  p. 217.\r\n\r\n  [119] Hume remarks ('An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of\r\n  Morals,' edit. of 1751, p. 132), \"there seems a necessity for\r\n  confessing that the happiness and misery of others are not\r\n  spectacles altogether indifferent to us, but that the view of\r\n  the former ... communicates a secret joy; the appearance of the\r\n  latter ... throws a melancholy damp over the imagination.\"\r\n\r\n  [120] 'Mental and Moral Science,' 1868, p. 254.\r\n\r\n  [121] I have given one such case, namely of three Patagonian\r\n  Indians who preferred being shot, one after the other, to\r\n  betraying the plans of their companions in war ('Journal of\r\n  Researches,' 1845, p. 103).\r\n\r\n  [122] Dr. Prosper Despine, in his 'Psychologie Naturelle,' 1868\r\n  (tom. i. p. 243; tom ii. p. 169) gives many curious cases of\r\n  the worst criminals, who apparently have been entirely\r\n  destitute of conscience.\r\n\r\n  [123] See an able article in the 'North British Review,' 1867,\r\n  p. 395.

Prof. Canestrini gives extracts on this subject from\r\n  various authorities. Laurillard remarks, that as he has found a\r\n  complete similarity in the form, proportions, and connexion of\r\n  the two malar bones in several human subjects and in certain\r\n  apes, he cannot consider this disposition of the parts as\r\n  simply accidental.\r\n\r\n  [176] A whole series of cases is given by Isid. Geoffroy\r\n  St.-Hilaire, 'Hist. des Anomalies,' tom. iii. p. 437.\r\n\r\n  [177] In my 'Variation of Animals under Domestication' (vol.\r\n  ii. p. 57) I attributed the not very rare cases of\r\n  supernumerary mammae in women to reversion. I was led to this as\r\n  a _probable_ conclusion, by the additional mammae being\r\n  generally placed symmetrically on the breast, and more\r\n  especially from one case, in which a single efficient mamma\r\n  occurred in the inguinal region of a woman, the daughter of\r\n  another woman with supernumerary mammae. But Prof. Preyer ('Der\r\n  Kampf um das Dasein,' 1869, s. 45) states that _mammae erraticae_\r\n  have been known to occur in other situations, even on the back;\r\n  so that the force of my argument is greatly weakened or perhaps\r\n  quite destroyed.\r\n\r\n  With much hesitation I, in the same work (vol. ii. p. 12),\r\n  attributed the frequent cases of polydactylism in men to\r\n  reversion. I was partly led to this through Prof. Owen's\r\n  statement, that some of the Ichthyopterygia possess more than\r\n  five digits, and therefore, as I supposed, had retained a\r\n  primordial condition; but after reading Prof. Gegenbaur's paper\r\n  ('Jenaischen Zeitschrift,' B. v. Heft 3, s. 341), who is the\r\n  highest authority in Europe on such a point, and who disputes\r\n  Owen's conclusion, I see that it is extremely doubtful whether\r\n  supernumerary digits can thus be accounted for. It was the fact\r\n  that such digits not only frequently occur and are strongly\r\n  inherited, but have the power of regrowth after amputation,\r\n  like the normal digits of the lower vertebrata, that chiefly\r\n  led me to the above conclusion. This extraordinary fact of\r\n  their regrowth remains inexplicable, if the belief in reversion\r\n  to some extremely remote progenitor must be rejected. I cannot,\r\n  however, follow Prof. Gegenbaur in supposing that additional\r\n  digits could not reappear through reversion, without at the\r\n  same time other parts of the skeleton being simultaneously and\r\n  similarly modified; for single characters often reappear\r\n  through reversion.\r\n\r\n  [178] 'Anatomy of Vertebrates,' vol. iii. 1868, p. 323.\r\n\r\n  [179] 'Generelle Morphologie,' 1866, B. ii. s. clv.\r\n\r\n  [180] Carl Vogt's 'Lectures on Man,' Eng. translat. 1864, p.\r\n  151.\r\n\r\n  [181] C.

The following references\r\n  relate to the few points touched on in my text: Proc.

I may here add\r\n  that Dr. Murie and Mr. St. George Mivart have shewn in their\r\n  Memoir on the Lemuroidea ('Transact. Zoolog. Soc.' vol. vii.\r\n  1869, p. 96), how extraordinarily variable some of the muscles\r\n  are in these animals, the lowest members of the Primates.\r\n  Gradations, also, in the muscles leading to structures found in\r\n  animals still lower in the scale, are numerous in the\r\n  Lemuroidea.\r\n\r\n  [185] Prof. Macalister in 'Proc. R. Irish Academy,' vol. x.\r\n  1868, p. 124.\r\n\r\n  [186] Prof. Macalister (ibid. p. 121) has tabulated his\r\n  observations, and finds that muscular abnormalities are most\r\n  frequent in the fore-arms, secondly in the face, thirdly in the\r\n  foot, &c.\r\n\r\n  [187] The Rev. Dr. Haughton, after giving ('Proc. R. Irish\r\n  Academy,' June 27, 1864, p. 715) a remarkable case of variation\r\n  in the human _flexor pollicis longus_, adds, \"This remarkable\r\n  example shews that man may sometimes possess the arrangement of\r\n  tendons of thumb and fingers characteristic of the macaque; but\r\n  whether such a case should be regarded as a macaque passing\r\n  upwards into a man, or a man passing downwards into a macaque,\r\n  or as a congenital freak of nature, I cannot undertake to say.\"\r\n  It is satisfactory to hear so capable an anatomist, and so\r\n  embittered an opponent of evolutionism, admitting even the\r\n  possibility of either of his first propositions. Prof.\r\n  Macalister has also described ('Proc. R. Irish Acad.' vol. x.\r\n  1864, p. 138) variations in the _flexor pollicis longus_,\r\n  remarkable from their relations to the same muscle in the\r\n  Quadrumana.\r\n\r\n  [188] The authorities for these several statements are given in\r\n  my 'Variation of Animals under Domestication,' vol. ii. p.\r\n  320-335.\r\n\r\n  [189] This whole subject has been discussed in chap. xxiii.\r\n  vol. ii. of my 'Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\n  Domestication.'\r\n\r\n  [190] See the ever memorable 'Essay on the Principle of\r\n  Population,' by the Rev.

This subject is\r\n  more fully discussed in Mr. Wallace's 'Contributions to the\r\n  Theory of Natural Selection,' 1870, in which all the essays\r\n  referred to in this work are republished. The 'Essay on Man'\r\n  has been ably criticised by Prof. Claparede, one of the most\r\n  distinguished zoologists in Europe, in an article published in\r\n  the 'Bibliotheque Universelle,' June, 1870. The remark quoted\r\n  in my text will surprise every one who has read Mr. Wallace's\r\n  celebrated paper on 'The Origin of Human Races deduced from the\r\n  Theory of Natural Selection,' originally published in the\r\n  'Anthropological Review,' May, 1864, p. clviii. I cannot here\r\n  resist quoting a most just remark by Sir J. Lubbock\r\n  ('Prehistoric Times,' 1865, p. 479) in reference to this paper,\r\n  namely, that Mr. Wallace, \"with characteristic unselfishness,\r\n  ascribes it (_i.e._ the idea of natural selection) unreservedly\r\n  to Mr. Darwin, although, as is well known, he struck out the\r\n  idea independently, and published it, though not with the same\r\n  elaboration, at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n  [199] Quoted by Mr. Lawson Tait in his \"Law of Natural\r\n  Selection,\"--'Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science,'\r\n  Feb. 1869.

Prof.\r\n  Huxley, in reviewing this latter work ('The Academy,' 1869, p.\r\n  42) says, that he considers the phylum or lines of descent of\r\n  the Vertebrata to be admirably discussed by Haeckel, although he\r\n  differs on some points. He expresses, also, his high estimate\r\n  of the value of the general tenor and spirit of the whole work.\r\n\r\n  [274] 'Palaeontology,' 1860, p. 199.\r\n\r\n  [275] I had the satisfaction of seeing, at the Falkland\r\n  Islands, in April, 1833, and therefore some years before any\r\n  other naturalist, the locomotive larvae of a compound Ascidian,\r\n  closely allied to, but apparently generically distinct from,\r\n  Synoicum. The tail was about five times as long as the oblong\r\n  head, and terminated in a very fine filament. It was plainly\r\n  divided, as sketched by me under a simple microscope, by\r\n  transverse opaque partitions, which I presume represent the\r\n  great cells figured by Kowalevsky. At an early stage of\r\n  development the tail was closely coiled round the head of the\r\n  larva.\r\n\r\n  [276] 'Memoires de l'Acad. des Sciences de St. Petersbourg,'\r\n  tom. x. No. 15, 1866.\r\n\r\n  [277] This is the conclusion of one of the highest authorities\r\n  in comparative anatomy, namely, Prof. Gegenbaur: 'Grundzuege der\r\n  vergleich. Anat.' 1870, s. 876. The result has been arrived at\r\n  chiefly from the study of the Amphibia; but it appears from the\r\n  researches of Waldeyer (as quoted in Humphry's 'Journal of\r\n  Anat. and Phys.' 1869, p. 161), that the sexual organs of even\r\n  \"the higher vertebrata are, in their early condition,\r\n  hermaphrodite.\" Similar views have long been held by some\r\n  authors, though until recently not well based.\r\n\r\n  [278] The male Thylacinus offers the best instance. Owen,\r\n  'Anatomy of Vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 771.\r\n\r\n  [279] Serranus is well known often to be in an hermaphrodite\r\n  condition; but Dr. Guenther informs me that he is convinced that\r\n  this is not its normal state. Descent from an ancient\r\n  androgynous prototype would, however, naturally favour and\r\n  explain, to a certain extent, the recurrence of this condition\r\n  in these fishes.\r\n\r\n  [280] Mr. Lockwood believes (as quoted in 'Quart. Journal of\r\n  Science,' April, 1868, p. 269), from what he has observed of\r\n  the development of Hippocampus, that the walls of the abdominal\r\n  pouch of the male in some way afford nourishment. On male\r\n  fishes hatching the ova in their mouths, see a very interesting\r\n  paper by Prof. Wyman, in 'Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist.'\r\n  Sept. 15, 1857; also Prof. Turner, in 'Journal of Anat. and\r\n  Phys.' Nov. 1, 1866, p. 78. Dr. Guenther has likewise described\r\n  similar cases.\r\n\r\n  [281] All vital functions tend to run their course in fixed and\r\n  recurrent periods, and with tidal animals the periods would\r\n  probably be lunar; for such animals must have been left dry or\r\n  covered deep with water,--supplied with copious food or\r\n  stinted,--during endless generations, at regular lunar\r\n  intervals. If then the Vertebrata are descended from an animal\r\n  allied to the existing tidal Ascidians, the mysterious fact,\r\n  that with the higher and now terrestrial Vertebrata, not to\r\n  mention other classes, many normal and abnormal vital processes\r\n  run their course according to lunar periods, is rendered\r\n  intelligible. A recurrent period, if approximately of the right\r\n  duration, when once gained, would not, as far as we can judge,\r\n  be liable to be changed; consequently it might be thus\r\n  transmitted during almost any number of generations. This\r\n  conclusion, if it could be proved sound, would be curious; for\r\n  we should then see that the period of gestation in each mammal,\r\n  and the hatching of each bird's eggs, and many other vital\r\n  processes, still betrayed the primordial birthplace of these\r\n  animals.\r\n\r\n  [282] 'History of India,' 1841, vol. i. p. 323. Father Ripa\r\n  makes exactly the same remark with respect to the Chinese.\r\n\r\n  [283] A vast number of measurements of Whites, Blacks, and\r\n  Indians, are given in the 'Investigations in the Military and\r\n  Anthropolog. Statistics of American Soldiers,' by B. A. Gould,\r\n  1869, p. 298-358; on the capacity of the lungs, p. 471. See\r\n  also the numerous and valuable tables, by Dr. Weisbach, from\r\n  the observations of Dr. Scherzer and Dr. Schwarz, in the 'Reise\r\n  der Novara: Anthropolog. Theil,' 1867.\r\n\r\n  [284] See, for instance, Mr. Marshall's account of the brain of\r\n  a Bush-woman, in 'Phil. Transact.' 1864, p. 519.\r\n\r\n  [285] Wallace, 'The Malay Archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 178.\r\n\r\n  [286] With respect to the figures in the famous Egyptian caves\r\n  of Abou-Simbel, M. Pouchet says ('The Plurality of the Human\r\n  Races,' Eng. translat. 1864, p. 50), that he was far from\r\n  finding recognisable representations of the dozen or more\r\n  nations which some authors believe that they can recognise.\r\n  Even some of the most strongly-marked races cannot be\r\n  identified with that degree of unanimity which might have been\r\n  expected from what has been written on the subject. Thus\r\n  Messrs. Nott and Gliddon ('Types of Mankind,' p. 148) state\r\n  that Rameses II., or the Great, has features superbly European;\r\n  whereas Knox, another firm believer in the specific distinction\r\n  of the races of man ('Races of Man,' 1850, p. 201), speaking of\r\n  young Memnon (the same person with Rameses II., as I am\r\n  informed by Mr. Birch) insists in the strongest manner that he\r\n  is identical in character with the Jews of Antwerp. Again,\r\n  whilst looking in the British Museum with two competent judges,\r\n  officers of the establishment, at the statue of Amunoph III.,\r\n  we agreed that he had a strongly negro cast of features; but\r\n  Messrs. Nott and Gliddon (ibid. p. 146, fig. 53) describe him\r\n  as \"a hybrid, but not of negro intermixture.\"\r\n\r\n  [287] As quoted by Nott and Gliddon, 'Types of Mankind,' 1854,\r\n  p. 439. They give also corroborative evidence; but C. Vogt\r\n  thinks that the subject requires further investigation.\r\n\r\n  [288] \"Diversity of Origin of the Human Races,\" in the\r\n  'Christian Examiner,' July, 1850.\r\n\r\n  [289] 'Transact. B.

Murray, in the\r\n  'Anthropolog. Review,' April, 1868, p. liii. In this letter\r\n  Count Strzelecki's statement, that Australian women who have\r\n  borne children to a white man are afterwards sterile with their\r\n  own race, is disproved. M. A. de Quatrefages has also collected\r\n  ('Revue des Cours Scientifiques,' March, 1869, p. 239) much\r\n  evidence that Australians and Europeans are not sterile when\r\n  crossed.\r\n\r\n  [292] 'An Examination of Prof. Agassiz's Sketch of the Nat.\r\n  Provinces of the Animal World,' Charleston, 1855, p. 44.\r\n\r\n  [293] 'Military and Anthropolog. Statistics of American\r\n  Soldiers,' by B. A. Gould, 1869, p. 319.\r\n\r\n  [294] 'The Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\n  Domestication,' vol. ii. p. 109. I may here remind the reader\r\n  that the sterility of species when crossed is not a\r\n  specially-acquired quality; but, like the incapacity of certain\r\n  trees to be grafted together, is incidental on other acquired\r\n  differences. The nature of these differences is unknown, but\r\n  they relate more especially to the reproductive system, and\r\n  much less to external structure or to ordinary differences in\r\n  constitution. One important element in the sterility of crossed\r\n  species apparently lies in one or both having been long\r\n  habituated to fixed conditions; for we know that changed\r\n  conditions have a special influence on the reproductive system,\r\n  and we have good reason to believe (as before remarked) that\r\n  the fluctuating conditions of domestication tend to eliminate\r\n  that sterility which is so general with species in a natural\r\n  state when crossed. It has elsewhere been shewn by me (ibid.\r\n  vol. ii. p. 185, and 'Origin of Species,' 5th edit. p. 317)\r\n  that the sterility of crossed species has not been acquired\r\n  through natural selection: we can see that when two forms have\r\n  already been rendered very sterile, it is scarcely possible\r\n  that their sterility should be augmented by the preservation or\r\n  survival of the more and more sterile individuals; for as the\r\n  sterility increases fewer and fewer offspring will be produced\r\n  from which to breed, and at last only single individuals will\r\n  be produced, at the rarest intervals. But there is even a\r\n  higher grade of sterility than this. Both Gaertner and Koelreuter\r\n  have proved that in genera of plants including numerous\r\n  species, a series can be formed from species which when crossed\r\n  yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never produce a\r\n  single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen of the other\r\n  species, for the germen swells. It is here manifestly\r\n  impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which have\r\n  already ceased to yield seeds; so that the acme of sterility,\r\n  when the germen alone is affected, cannot be gained through\r\n  selection. This acme, and no doubt the other grades of\r\n  sterility, are the incidental results of certain unknown\r\n  differences in the constitution of the reproductive system of\r\n  the species which are crossed.\r\n\r\n  [295] 'The Variation of Animals,' &c., vol. ii. p. 92.\r\n\r\n  [296] M. de Quatrefages has given ('Anthropolog. Review,' Jan.\r\n  1869, p. 22) an interesting account of the success and energy\r\n  of the Paulistas in Brazil, who are a much crossed race of\r\n  Portuguese and Indians, with a mixture of the blood of other\r\n  races.\r\n\r\n  [297] For instance with the aborigines of America and\r\n  Australia. Prof. Huxley says ('Transact. Internat. Congress of\r\n  Prehist. Arch.' 1868. p. 105) that the skulls of many South\r\n  Germans and Swiss are \"as short and as broad as those of the\r\n  Tartars,\" &c.\r\n\r\n  [298] See a good discussion on this subject in Waitz,\r\n  'Introduct. to Anthropology,' Eng. translat. 1863, p. 198-208,\r\n  227.

Namely, whether there is any relation in\r\n  Europeans between the colour of their hair, and their liability\r\n  to the diseases of tropical countries. If the surgeons of the\r\n  several regiments, when stationed in unhealthy tropical\r\n  districts, would be so good as first to count, as a standard of\r\n  comparison, how many men, in the force whence the sick are\r\n  drawn, have dark and light-coloured hair, and hair of\r\n  intermediate or doubtful tints; and if a similar account were\r\n  kept by the same medical gentlemen, of all the men who suffered\r\n  from malarious and yellow fevers, or from dysentery, it would\r\n  soon be apparent, after some thousand cases had been tabulated,\r\n  whether there exists any relation between the colour of the\r\n  hair and constitutional liability to tropical diseases. Perhaps\r\n  no such relation would be discovered, but the investigation is\r\n  well worth making. In case any positive result were obtained,\r\n  it might be of some practical use in selecting men for any\r\n  particular service. Theoretically the result would be of high\r\n  interest, as indicating one means by which a race of men\r\n  inhabiting from a remote period an unhealthy tropical climate,\r\n  might have become dark-coloured by the better preservation of\r\n  dark-haired or dark-complexioned individuals during a long\r\n  succession of generations.\"\r\n\r\n  [330] 'Anthropological Review,' Jan. 1866, p. xxi.\r\n\r\n  [331] See, for instance, Quatrefages ('Revue des Cours\r\n  Scientifiques,' Oct. 10, 1868, p. 724) on the effects of\r\n  residence in Abyssinia and Arabia, and other analogous cases.\r\n  Dr. Rolle ('Der Mensch, seine Abstammung,' &c., 1865, s. 99)\r\n  states, on the authority of Khanikof, that the greater number\r\n  of German families settled in Georgia, have acquired in the\r\n  course of two generations dark hair and eyes.

Many hermaphrodite plants are, as first shewn by C. K.\r\n  Sprengel, dichogamous; that is, their male and female organs\r\n  are not ready at the same time, so that they cannot be\r\n  self-fertilised. Now with such plants the pollen is generally\r\n  mature in the same flower before the stigma, though there are\r\n  some exceptional species in which the female organs are mature\r\n  before the male.\r\n\r\n  [339] I have received information, hereafter to be given, to\r\n  this effect with respect to poultry. Even with birds, such as\r\n  pigeons, which pair for life, the female, as I hear from Mr.\r\n  Jenner Weir, will desert her mate if he is injured or grows\r\n  weak.\r\n\r\n  [340] On the Gorilla, Savage and Wyman, 'Boston Journal of Nat.\r\n  Hist.' vol. v. 1845-47, p. 423.

Audouin believes that the females are impregnated by the\r\n  males which are born in the same cells with them; but it is\r\n  much more probable that the females visit other cells, and thus\r\n  avoid close inter-breeding. We shall hereafter meet with a few\r\n  exceptional cases, in various classes, in which the female,\r\n  instead of the male, is the seeker and wooer.\r\n\r\n  [348] 'Essays and Observations,' edited by Owen, vol. i. 1861,\r\n  p. 194.\r\n\r\n  [349] Prof. Sachs ('Lehrbuch der Botanik,' 1870, s. 633) in\r\n  speaking of the male and female reproductive cells, remarks,\r\n  \"verhaelt sich die eine bei der Vereinigung activ, ... die\r\n  andere erscheint bei der Vereinigung passiv.\"\r\n\r\n  [350] 'Reise der Novara: Anthropolog.

With cattle Youatt says ('Cattle,' 1834, p.\r\n  277) that the prominence of the frontal bone penetrates the\r\n  cutis at birth, and that the horny matter is soon formed over\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  [362] I am greatly indebted to Prof. Victor Carus for having\r\n  made inquiries for me, from the highest authorities, with\r\n  respect to the merino sheep of Saxony. On the Guinea coast of\r\n  Africa there is a breed of sheep in which, as with merinos, the\r\n  rams alone bear horns; and Mr. Winwood Reade informs me that in\r\n  the one case observed, a young ram born on Feb. 10th first\r\n  showed horns on March 6th, so that in this instance the\r\n  development of the horns occurred at a later period of life,\r\n  conformably with our rule, than in the Welsh sheep, in which\r\n  both sexes are horned.\r\n\r\n  [363] In the common peacock (_Pavo cristatus_) the male alone\r\n  possesses spurs, whilst both sexes of the Java peacock (_P.\r\n  muticus_) offer the unusual case of being furnished with spurs.\r\n  Hence I fully expected that in the latter species they would\r\n  have been developed earlier in life than in the common peacock;\r\n  but M. Hegt of Amsterdam informs me, that with young birds of\r\n  the previous year, belonging to both species, compared on April\r\n  23rd, 1869, there was no difference in the development of the\r\n  spurs. The spurs, however, were as yet represented merely by\r\n  slight knobs or elevations. I presume that I should have been\r\n  informed if any difference in the rate of development had\r\n  subsequently been observed.\r\n\r\n  [364] In some other species of the Duck Family the speculum in\r\n  the two sexes differs in a greater degree; but I have not been\r\n  able to discover whether its full development occurs later in\r\n  life in the males of such species, than in the male of the\r\n  common duck, as ought to be the case according to our rule.\r\n  With the allied _Mergus cucullatus_ we have, however, a case of\r\n  this kind: the two sexes differ conspicuously in general\r\n  plumage, and to a considerable degree in the speculum, which is\r\n  pure white in the male and greyish-white in the female. Now the\r\n  young males at first resemble, in all respects, the female, and\r\n  have a greyish-white speculum, but this becomes pure white at\r\n  an earlier age than that at which the adult male acquires his\r\n  other more strongly-marked sexual differences in plumage: see\r\n  Audubon, 'Ornithological Biography,' vol. iii. 1835, p.\r\n  249-250.\r\n\r\n  [365] 'Das Ganze der Taubenzucht,' 1837, s. 21, 24.

Dr. Stark also remarks ('Tenth Annual Report of\r\n  Births, Deaths, &c., in Scotland,' 1867, p. xxviii) that \"These\r\n  examples may suffice to shew that, at almost every stage of\r\n  life, the males in Scotland have a greater liability to death\r\n  and a higher death-rate than the females. The fact, however, of\r\n  this peculiarity being most strongly developed at that\r\n  infantile period of life when the dress, food, and general\r\n  treatment of both sexes are alike, seems to prove that the\r\n  higher male death-rate is an impressed, natural, and\r\n  constitutional peculiarity due to sex alone.\"\r\n\r\n  [372] With the savage Guaranys of Paraguay, according to the\r\n  accurate Azara ('Voyages dans l'Amerique merid.' tom. ii. 1809,\r\n  p. 60, 179), the women in proportion to the men are as 14 to\r\n  13.\r\n\r\n  [373] Leuckart in Wagner, 'Handwoerterbuch der Phys.'

Thus during 1866, 809 male\r\n  colts and 816 female colts were born, and 743 mares failed to\r\n  produce offspring. During 1867, 836 males and 902 females were\r\n  born, and 794 mares failed.\r\n\r\n  [376] I am much indebted to Mr. Cupples for having procured for\r\n  me the above returns from Scotland, as well as some of the\r\n  following returns on cattle.

But their\r\n  importance, under a functional point of view, as Mr. E.\r\n  MacLachlan has remarked to me, has probably been overrated. It\r\n  has been suggested, that slight differences in these organs\r\n  would suffice to prevent the intercrossing of well-marked\r\n  varieties or incipient species, and would thus aid in their\r\n  development. That this can hardly be the case, we may infer\r\n  from the many recorded cases (see for instance, Bronn,\r\n  'Geschichte der Natur,' B. ii. 1843, s. 164; and Westwood,\r\n  'Transact. Ent. Soc.' vol. iii. 1842, p. 195) of distinct\r\n  species having been observed in union. Mr. MacLachlan informs\r\n  me (vide 'Stett. Ent. Zeitung,' 1867, s. 155) that when several\r\n  species of Phryganidae, which present strongly-pronounced\r\n  differences of this kind, were confined together by Dr. Aug.\r\n  Meyer, _they coupled_, and one pair produced fertile ova.\r\n\r\n  [429] 'The Practical Entomologist,' Philadelphia, vol. ii.

Kirby and Spence ('Introduct. to Entomology,' vol.\r\n  iii. p. 301) mention a Cantharis, Meloe, Rhagium, and the\r\n  _Leptura testacea_; the male of the latter being testaceous,\r\n  with a black thorax, and the female of a dull red all over.\r\n  These two latter beetles belong to the Order of Longicorns.\r\n  Messrs. R. Trimen and Waterhouse, junr., inform me of two\r\n  Lamellicorns, viz., a Peritrichia and Trichius, the male of the\r\n  latter being more obscurely coloured than the female. In\r\n  _Tillus elongatus_ the male is black, and the female always, as\r\n  it is believed, of a dark blue colour with a red thorax. The\r\n  male, also, of _Orsodacna atra_, as I hear from Mr. Walsh, is\r\n  black, the female (the so-called _O. ruficollis_) having a\r\n  rufous thorax.\r\n\r\n  [485] 'Proc. Entomolog.

I may add that my son, Mr. F. Darwin, finds that\r\n  _Dermestes murinus_ stridulates, but he searched in vain for\r\n  the apparatus.

In Blethisa the transverse ridges on the\r\n  furrowed border of the abdominal segment do not come into play,\r\n  as far as I could judge, in scraping the rasps on the elytra.\r\n\r\n  [499] I am indebted to Mr. Walsh, of Illinois, for having sent\r\n  me extracts from Leconte's 'Introduction to Entomology,' p.\r\n  101, 143.\r\n\r\n  [500] M. P. de la Brulerie, as quoted in 'Journal of Travel,'\r\n  A.

Olivier says (as quoted by Kirby and Spence,\r\n  'Introduct.' vol. ii. p. 395) that the female of _Pimelia\r\n  striata_ produces a rather loud sound by striking her abdomen\r\n  against any hard substance, \"and that the male, obedient to\r\n  this call, soon attends her and they pair.\"\r\n\r\n  [502] Apatura Iris: 'The Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer,'\r\n  1859, p. 139.

In this latter species the\r\n  difference in colour between the two sexes is strongly marked;\r\n  and Mr. Wallace informs me that we here have, as he believes,\r\n  an instance of protective mimickry confined to one sex, as will\r\n  hereafter be more fully explained. The white female of the\r\n  Cycnia resembles the very common _Spilosoma menthrasti_, both\r\n  sexes of which are white; and Mr. Stainton observed that this\r\n  latter moth was rejected with utter disgust by a whole brood of\r\n  young turkeys, which were fond of eating other moths; so that\r\n  if the Cycnia was commonly mistaken by British birds for the\r\n  Spilosoma, it would escape being devoured, and its white\r\n  deceptive colour would thus be highly beneficial.\r\n\r\n  [518] 'Rambles of a Naturalist in the Chinese Seas,' 1868, p.\r\n  182.\r\n\r\n  [519] Wallace on the Papilionidae of the Malayan Region, in\r\n  'Transact.

The writer\r\n  strangely supposes that I attribute the variations in colour of\r\n  the Lepidoptera, by which certain species belonging to distinct\r\n  families have come to resemble others, to reversion to a common\r\n  progenitor; but there is no more reason to attribute these\r\n  variations to reversion than in the case of any ordinary\r\n  variation.\r\n\r\n  [529] Wallace, \"Notes on Eastern Butterflies,\" 'Transact. Ent.\r\n  Soc.' 1869, p. 287.\r\n\r\n  [530] Wallace, in 'Westminster Review,' July, 1867, p. 37; and\r\n  in 'Journal of Travel and Nat. Hist.' vol. i. 1868, p. 88.\r\n\r\n  [531] See remarks by Messrs. Bates and Wallace, in 'Proc. Ent.\r\n  Soc.' Nov. 19, 1866, p. xxxix.\r\n\r\n  [532] See Mr. Wallace in 'Westminster Review,' July, 1867, p.\r\n  11 and 37. The male of no butterfly, as Mr. Wallace informs me,\r\n  is known to differ in colour, as a protection, from the female;\r\n  and he asks me how I can explain this fact on the principle\r\n  that one sex alone has varied and has transmitted its\r\n  variations exclusively to the same sex, without the aid of\r\n  selection to check the variations being inherited by the other\r\n  sex. No doubt if it could be shewn that the females of very\r\n  many species had been rendered beautiful through protective\r\n  mimickry, but that this has never occurred with the males, it\r\n  would be a serious difficulty. But the number of cases as yet\r\n  known hardly suffices for a fair judgment. We can see that the\r\n  males, from having the power of flying more swiftly, and thus\r\n  escaping danger, would not be so likely as the females to have\r\n  had their colours modified for the sake of protection; but this\r\n  would not in the least have interfered with their receiving\r\n  protective colours through inheritance from the females. In the\r\n  second place, it is probable that sexual selection would\r\n  actually tend to prevent a beautiful male from becoming\r\n  obscure, for the less brilliant individuals would be less\r\n  attractive to the females. Supposing that the beauty of the\r\n  male of any species had been mainly acquired through sexual\r\n  selection, yet if this beauty likewise served as a protection,\r\n  the acquisition would have been aided by natural selection. But\r\n  it would be quite beyond our power to distinguish between the\r\n  two processes of sexual and ordinary selection. Hence it is not\r\n  likely that we should be able to adduce cases of the males\r\n  having been rendered brilliant exclusively through protective\r\n  mimickry, though this is comparatively easy with the females,\r\n  which have rarely or never been rendered beautiful, as far as\r\n  we can judge, for the sake of sexual attraction, although they\r\n  have often received beauty through inheritance from their male\r\n  parents.\r\n\r\n  [533] 'Proc.
