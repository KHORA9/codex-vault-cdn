Its label reads: \"Packard\r\nDiesel Engine--1928--This first compression-ignition engine to power an\r\nairplane developed 225 hp at 1950 revolutions per minute. It was\r\ndesigned under the direction of L. M. Woolson. In 1931, a production\r\nexample of this engine powered a Bellanca airplane to an 84 hour and 33\r\nminute nonrefueled duration record which has never been\r\nequalled.--Weight/power ratio: 2.26 lb per hp--Gift of Packard Motor Car\r\nCo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1 (left).--Front view of first Packard diesel,\r\n1928.

Heywood starter (air) fitting shown on the head of the\r\nnext to lowest cylinder. (Smithsonian photo A2388C.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis revolutionary engine was created in the short time of one year.\r\nWithin two years of its introduction in 1928, airplane diesel engines\r\nwere being tested in England by Rolls-Royce, in France by Panhard, in\r\nGermany by Junkers, in Italy by Fiat, and in the United States by\r\nGuiberson. Packard had demonstrated to the world the remarkable economy\r\nand safety of the airplane diesel engine, and the response was immediate\r\nand favorable. The novelty and performance of the Packard diesel assured\r\nit a large and attentive audience wherever it was exhibited. Yet in\r\nspite of its performance record the engine was doomed to failure by\r\nreason of its design, and it was further handicapped by having been\r\nrushed into production before it could be thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe official beginning of the Packard diesel engine can be traced to a\r\nlicense agreement dated August 18, 1927, between Alvan Macauley,\r\npresident of the Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, and\r\nDipl. Ing. Hermann I. A. Dorner, a diesel engine inventor of Hanover,\r\nGermany.[1] Before the agreement was drawn up, Capt. Lionel M. Woolson,\r\nchief aeronautical engineer for Packard, tested an air-cooled and a\r\nwater-cooled diesel that Dorner had designed and built in Germany.[2]\r\nBoth engines attained the then high revolutions per minute of 2000 and\r\nproved efficient and durable. They demonstrated the practicability of\r\nDorner's patented \"solid\" type of fuel injection which formed the basis\r\nof the Packard diesel's design.[3] Using elements from Dorner's engines,\r\nWoolson and Dorner designed the Packard diesel with the help of Packard\r\nengineers and Dorner's assistant, Adolph Widmann. Woolson was\r\nresponsible for the weight-saving features, and Dorner for the\r\ncombustion system.\r\n\r\nThe historic first flight took place on September 19, 1928, at the\r\nPackard proving grounds in Utica, Michigan, just a year and a month from\r\nthe day Dorner agreed to join the Packard team. Woolson and Walter E.\r\nLees, Packard's chief test pilot, used a Stinson SM-1DX \"Detroiter.\" The\r\nflight was so successful, and later tests were so encouraging, that\r\nPackard built a $650,000 plant during the first half of 1929 solely for\r\nthe production of its diesel engine. The factory was designed to employ\r\nmore than 600 men, and 500 engines a month were to have been\r\nmanufactured by July 1929.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Alvan Macauley (left), President of the\r\nPackard Motor Car Co. and Col. Charles A. Lindbergh with the original\r\nPackard diesel-powered Stinson \"Detroiter\" in the background, 1929.\r\n(Smithsonian photo A48319D.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engine's first cross-country flight was accomplished on May 13,\r\n1929, when Lees flew the Stinson SM-1DX \"Detroiter\" from Detroit,\r\nMichigan, to Norfolk, Virginia, carrying Woolson to the annual field day\r\nof the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at Langley Field. The\r\n700-mile trip was flown in 6-1/2 hours, and the cost of the fuel\r\nconsumed was $4.68. Had the airplane been powered with a comparable\r\ngasoline engine, the fuel cost would have been about 5 times as\r\ngreat.[5] On March 9, 1930, using the same airplane and engine, Lees and\r\nWoolson flew from Detroit, Michigan, to Miami, Florida, a distance of\r\n1100 miles in 10 hours and 15 minutes with a fuel cost of $8.50. The\r\nproduction engine, slightly refined from the original, received the\r\nfirst approved type certificate issued for any diesel aircraft engine on\r\nMarch 6, 1930. The Department of Commerce granted certificate no. 43\r\nafter the Packard Company had ground- and flight-tested this type of\r\nengine for approximately 338,000 hp hr, or about 1500 hr of\r\noperation.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Dipl. Ing. Hermann I. A. Dorner, 1930. German\r\ndiesel engine designer, was responsible for the Packard DR-980 aircraft\r\nengine. (Smithsonian photo A48645.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--Capt. Lionel M. Woolson, 1931. Chief\r\nAeronautical Engineer, Packard Motor Car Co. Designer of Packard DR-980\r\ndiesel engine. (Smithsonian photo A48645A.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the early production versions powered a Bellanca \"Pacemaker\"\r\nwhich was piloted by Lees and his assistant Frederic A. Brossy to a\r\nworld's nonrefueling heavier-than-air duration record. The flight\r\nlasted for 84 hours, 33 minutes from May 25 through 28, 1931, over\r\nJacksonville, Florida. This event was so important that it was the basis\r\nof the following editorial, published in the July 1931 issue of\r\n_Aviation_,[7] which summarizes so well the progress made by the diesel\r\nengine over a 3-year period and the hope held for its future:\r\n\r\n     A RECORD CROSSES THE ATLANTIC--The Diesel engine took its first\r\n     step toward acceptance as a powerplant for heavier-than-air craft\r\n     when, in the summer of 1928, a diesel-powered machine first flew.\r\n     The second step was made at the 1930 Detroit show, when the engine\r\n     went on commercial sale. The third was accomplished last month,\r\n     when a plane with a compression-ignition engine using furnace oil\r\n     as a fuel circled over the beaches around Jacksonville for 84 hours\r\n     and inscribed its performance upon the books as a world's\r\n     record--the longest flight ever made without intermediate\r\n     refueling.\r\n\r\n     With the passing of the refueling-duration excitement, and with the\r\n     apparent decision to allow that record to stand permanently at its\r\n     present level, trials for straight time in the air without\r\n     replenishment of supplies begin to regain a proper degree of\r\n     appreciation. No other record, unless it be some of those for speed\r\n     with substantial dead loads, is of such importance as the non-stop\r\n     distance and duration marks. No other has such bearing upon\r\n     precisely those qualities of aerodynamic efficiency, fuel economy,\r\n     and reliability of airplane and powerplant that most affect\r\n     commercial usefulness. It is more than three years since the\r\n     duration record left American shores, and it has been more than\r\n     doubled in that time. Its return is very welcome.\r\n\r\n     It is doubly welcome for being made with a fundamentally new type\r\n     of engine. The diesel principle is not a commercial monopoly. It is\r\n     open to anyone. Already two different designs in America, and one\r\n     or two in Europe, have been in the air. For certain purposes, at\r\n     least, it seems reasonable to expect that its special advantages\r\n     will bring it into widespread use. Every practical demonstration of\r\n     the progress of the diesel toward realizing its theoretical\r\n     possibilities in the air as it has realized them on the land and at\r\n     sea is a bit of progress toward better and more economical\r\n     commercial flying, and so benefits the whole industry. The fourth,\r\n     and next, main element in the demonstration will be provided when\r\n     diesels go into regular service on some well-known transport line\r\n     as standard equipment, and the accumulation of data on performance\r\n     under normal service conditions begins. We believe that that will\r\n     happen before the end of 1932.\r\n\r\n     Many men, from Dr. Rudolf Diesel to Walter Lees and Frederic\r\n     Brossy, have had direct or indirect hands in the making of this\r\n     record. The greatest of all contributions was that of Lionel M.\r\n     Woolson, who created the engine and flew with it in every test and\r\n     brought it through its early troubles to the point of readiness for\r\n     the commercial market. The flight that lasted four days and three\r\n     nights is his memorial, quite as much as is the bronze plaque\r\n     unveiled last April in the Detroit show hangar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--Stinson SM-1DX \"Detroiter.\" This airplane,\r\npowered with original Packard DR-980 diesel engine, made the world's\r\nfirst diesel-powered flight on September 19, 1928.

(Smithsonian\r\nphoto A48319E.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Robert J. Collier Trophy, America's highest aviation award, was won\r\nby the Packard Motor Car Company in 1931 for its development of the\r\ndiesel engine. The formal presentation was made at the White House,\r\nMarch 31, 1932, by President Hoover on behalf of the National Aeronautic\r\nAssociation. Alvan Macauley, president of the Packard Motor Car Company,\r\naccepted the trophy, saying: \"We do not claim, Mr. President, that we\r\nhave reached the final development even though our diesel aircraft\r\nengine is an accomplished fact and we have the pioneer's joy of knowing\r\nthat we have successfully accomplished what had not been done\r\nbefore....\"[8] The amazing early success of the Packard diesel is\r\nillustrated by the following chronological summary:\r\n\r\n     1927--License agreement signed between Alvan Macauley and Hermann\r\n     I. A. Dorner to permit designing of the engine.\r\n\r\n     1928--First flight of a diesel-powered airplane accomplished.\r\n\r\n     1929--First cross-country flights accomplished.\r\n\r\n     1930--Packard diesels were sold on the commercial market and were\r\n     used to power airplanes manufactured by a dozen different American\r\n     companies.\r\n\r\n     1931--World's official duration record for nonrefueled\r\n     heavier-than-air flight. First flight across the Atlantic by a\r\n     diesel-powered airplane.\r\n\r\n     1932--Packard diesels tested successfully in the Goodyear nonrigid\r\n     airship _Defender_.[9] Official American altitude record for\r\n     diesel-powered airplanes established (this record still stands).\r\n\r\nIn spite of this promising record, the project died in 1933. The\r\nDecember 1950 issue of _Pegasus_ gave two reasons for the failure of the\r\nengine: \"One blow had already been dealt the program through the\r\naccidental death of Capt. L. M. Woolson, Packard's chief engineer in\r\ncharge of the Diesel development, on April 23, 1930. Then the Big\r\nDepression took its toll in research work everywhere and Packard was not\r\nexcepted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--Walter E. Lees, Packard chief test pilot (in\r\ncabin) and Frederic A.

From \"Aero Digest,\" February 1932. (Smithsonian photo\r\nA49674.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engine did not fail for the above mentioned reasons. Capt. Woolson's\r\ndeath was indeed unfortunate, but there were others connected with the\r\nproject who carried on his work for three years after he passed away.\r\nThe big depression was also unfortunate, but it did not stop\r\naeronautical engine development. \"It was a time when such an engine\r\nwould have been most welcome if it had been produced in large enough\r\nnumbers to bring the price down to compare favorably pricewise with gas\r\nengines of the same horsepower class.\"[10] The Packard diesel failed\r\nbecause it was not a good engine. It was an ingenious engine, and two of\r\nthe several features it pioneered (the use of magnesium and of a\r\ndynamically balanced crankshaft) survive in modern reciprocating engine\r\ndesigns. In addition, when it was first introduced, no other engine\r\ncould match it for economical fuel consumption and fuel safety.

(Smithsonian photo A48846.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the size, weight, and general arrangement of the Packard diesel\r\ndid not differ radically from conventional gasoline engines of a similar\r\ntype, there were definite differences caused by the diesel cycle. In the\r\nwords of Capt. Woolson:[12]\r\n\r\nAs this engine operates on an entirely different principle than the\r\ngasoline engines used heretofore in aircraft, it is desirable before\r\nlaunching into a mechanical description to consider first in a general\r\nway the principles of operation of the Diesel cycle as opposed to the\r\nOtto cycle principle on which nearly all gasoline engines operate.\r\n\r\nThe real point of departure between the two systems of operation is the\r\nignition system involved. In the gasoline engine an electric spark is\r\ndepended upon to fire a combustible mixture of gasoline vapor and air\r\nwhich mixture ratio must be maintained within rather narrow limits to be\r\nfired by this method....\r\n\r\nIn the Diesel engine, air alone is introduced into the cylinders,\r\ninstead of a mixture of air and fuel as in the gasoline engine, and this\r\nair is compressed into much smaller space than is possible when using a\r\nmixture of gasoline and air, which would spontaneously and prematurely\r\ndetonate if compressed to this degree. The temperature of the air in the\r\ncylinder at the end of the compression stroke of a Diesel engine\r\noperating with a compression ratio of about 16:1 is approximately 1000\r\ndegrees Fahr., which is far above the spontaneous-ignition temperature\r\nof the fuel used. Accordingly, when the fuel is injected in a highly\r\natomized condition at some time previous to the piston reaching the end\r\nof its stroke, the fuel burns as it comes in contact with the highly\r\nheated air, and the greatly increased pressures resulting from the\r\ntremendous increase in temperature brought about by this combustion,\r\nacting on the pistons, drive the engine, as in the case of the gasoline\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nSumming up, the differences between the Diesel and gasoline engines\r\nstart with the fact that the gasoline engine requires a complicated\r\nelectrical ignition system in order to fire the combustible mixture,\r\nwhereas the Diesel engine generates its own heat to start combustion by\r\nmeans of highly compressed air. This brings about the necessity for\r\ninjecting the fuel in a well-atomized condition at the time that\r\ncombustion is desired and the quantities of fuel injected at this time\r\ncontrol the amount of heat generated; that is, an infinitesimally small\r\nquantity of fuel will be burned just as efficiently in the Diesel engine\r\nas a full charge of fuel, whereas in the gasoline engine the mixture\r\nratio must be kept reasonably constant and, if the supply of fuel is to\r\nbe cut down for throttling purposes, the supply of air must be\r\ncorrespondingly reduced. It is this requirement in a gasoline engine\r\nthat necessitates an accurate and sensitive fuel-and-air metering device\r\nknown as the carburetor.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the air supply of a Diesel engine is compressed and its\r\ntemperature raised to such a high degree permits the use of liquid fuels\r\nwith a high ignition temperature. These fuels correspond more nearly to\r\nthe crude petroleum oil as it issues from the wells and this fact\r\naccounts for the much lower cost of Diesel fuel as compared to the\r\nhighly refined gasoline needed for aircraft engines.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeight-Saving Features\r\n\r\nIn order to be successful in aviation use, the modern lightweight diesel\r\nof the time had to have its weight reduced from 25 lb/hp to 2.5 lb/hp.\r\nThis required unusual design and construction methods, as follows:\r\n\r\nCrankcase: It weighed only 34 lb because of three factors: Magnesium\r\nalloy was used extensively in its construction, thus saving weight as\r\ncompared with aluminum alloy, which was the conventional material at\r\nthis time. It was a single casting. This saved weight because heavy\r\nflanges, nuts, and bolts were dispensed with. The cylinders, instead of\r\nbeing bolted to the crankcase, as was normal practice, were held in\r\nposition by two circular hoops of alloy steel passing over the cylinder\r\nflanges. They were tightened to such an extent that at no time did the\r\ncylinders transfer any tension loads to the crankcase. This type of\r\nfastening actually strengthened the crankcase in contrast to the usual\r\nmethod. For this reason it could be built lighter. The hoops did not\r\nalways function well. \"The first job I ever did on the Towle was to\r\npatch the holes in the top and bottom of the hull when a cylinder blew\r\noff during run-up and nearly beheaded the pilot.\"[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--Rear view of engine with rear crankcase cover\r\nremoved, showing valve and injector rocker levers and injector control\r\nring mounted on crankcase diaphram. U.S. Navy test, 1931. (Smithsonian\r\nphoto A48323D.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--Main crankcase.

(Smithsonian photo A48323A.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26.--Crankshaft with automatic-timing retarding\r\ndevice on rear end of pivoted- and spring-mounted counterweights. U.S.\r\nNavy test, 1931. (Smithsonian photo A48323B.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.--Propeller hub and vibration damper. U.S. Navy\r\ntest, 1931. (Smithsonian photo A48325A.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCrankshaft: Since this engine developed the high maximum cylinder\r\npressure of 1500 psi, it was necessary to protect the crankshaft from\r\nthe resulting heavy stresses. Without such protection the crankshaft\r\nwould be too large and heavy for practical aeronautical applications.\r\nAlthough the maximum cylinder pressures were 10 times as great as the\r\naverage ones, they were of short duration. The method of protecting the\r\ncrankshaft took full advantage of this fact. It consisted of having the\r\ncounterweights flexibly mounted instead of being rigidly bolted, as was\r\ncommon practice. The counterweights were pivoted on the crank cheeks.\r\nPowerful compression springs absorbed the maximum impulses by permitting\r\nthe counterweights to lag slightly, yet forced them to travel precisely\r\nwith the crank cheeks at all other times.\r\n\r\nPropeller Hub: The propeller is, of course, subject to the same stresses\r\nas the crankshaft. Instead of being rigidly bolted to the shaft as was\r\ncommon practice, it was further protected from excessive acceleration\r\nforces by being mounted in a rubber-cushioned hub. This permitted the\r\nuse of a lighter propeller and hub.\r\n\r\nValves: A further weight saving resulted from the use of a single valve\r\nfor each cylinder instead of two as in the case of conventional gasoline\r\naircraft engines. (A diesel engine designed in this manner loses less\r\nefficiency than a gasoline one because only air is drawn in during the\r\nintake stroke.) In addition to the weight saving brought about by having\r\nfewer parts in the valve mechanism, there was an additional advantage\r\nsince the cylinder heads could be made considerably lighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28.--Cylinder disassembly, showing valve and fuel\r\ninjector. U.S. Navy test, 1931. (Smithsonian photo A48324D.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDiesel Cycle Features\r\n\r\nAlthough Woolson designed the ingenious weight-saving features, Dorner\r\nwas responsible for the engine's diesel cycle which employed the \"solid\"\r\ntype of fuel injection. In order to understand Dorner's contribution, a\r\nbrief description of the type of diesel injection pioneered by Dr.\r\nRudolf Diesel is necessary. His system injected the fuel into the\r\ncylinder head with a blast of air supplied by a special air reservoir at\r\na pressure of 1000 psi or more. Known as the \"air blast\" type of\r\ninjection it produced good turbulence, with the fuel and air thoroughly\r\nmixed before being ignited. Such mixing increases engine efficiency, but\r\nit involves the provision of bulky and costly air-compressing apparatus\r\nwhich can absorb more than 5 percent of the engine's power. Naturally\r\nthe compressor also adds considerably to the engine's weight.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this, a \"solid\" type of fuel injection may be employed to\r\neliminate the complications of the \"air blast\" system. It consists of\r\ninjecting only fuel at a pressure of 1000 psi or more. Air is admitted\r\nby intake stroke, as with a gasoline engine. Turbulence is induced by\r\ndesigning the combustion chamber and piston so as to give a whirling\r\nmotion to the air during the intake stroke. The following quotation from\r\nDorner now becomes readily understandable. \"Since 1922 my invention\r\nconsisted in eliminating the highly complicated compressor and in\r\ninjecting directly such a highly diffused fuel spray so that a quick\r\nfirst ignition could be depended upon. By means of rotating the air\r\ncolumn around the cylinder axis, fresh air was constantly led along the\r\nfuel spray to achieve completely sootless burning-up.... In 1930 I sold\r\nmy U.S.A. patents to Packard.\"[14]\r\n\r\nValve Ports: The inlet port (which was also the exhaust port) was\r\narranged tangentially to the cylinder. This design imparted a very rapid\r\nwhirling motion to the incoming air, thereby aiding the combustion\r\nprocess. Engine efficiency and rpm were both increased.\r\n\r\nFuel Injector Pumps: A combination fuel pump and nozzle was provided for\r\neach cylinder in contrast to the usual system of having a multiple pump\r\nunit remotely placed with regard to the nozzles. The former system was\r\nadopted after frequent fuel-line failures were experienced due to the\r\nengine's vibration. Woolson stated that his system prevented pressure\r\nwaves, which interfered with the correct timing of the fuel injection,\r\nfrom forming in the tubing. Leigh M. Griffith, vice president of Emsco\r\nAero, writing in the September 1930, _S.A.E. Journal_ stated: \"Regarding\r\nthe superiority claim for the simple combination of fuel pump and\r\ninjection valve into one unit, without connecting piping, the author\r\nentirely overlooks the fact that the elasticity of a pipe and its\r\ncontained fuel can be important aids in securing that extremely abrupt\r\nbeginning and ending of injection which is so desirable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 29.--Fuel-injector disassembly. U.S. Navy test,\r\n1931. (Smithsonian photo A48323C.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nA major advantage obtained from combining the fuel pump and injection\r\nvalve is the ability of an engine so equipped to burn a wide variety of\r\nfuels. The elimination of the above-mentioned type of high-pressure\r\ntubing reduces the possibility of a vapor lock occurring, thereby\r\npermitting more volatile fuels to be burned. This increases the range of\r\nhydrocarbon fuels the engine can utilize. It could run on any type of\r\nhydrocarbon from gasoline to melted butter.[15]\r\n\r\nAnother reason for combining the fuel pump and injection valve is given\r\nby P. E. Biggar in _Diesel Engines_ (published in 1936 by the Macmillan\r\nCompany of Canada Ltd., Toronto): \"In the Dorner pump, for example, the\r\nstroke of the plunger is changed by using a lever-type lifter and moving\r\nthe push-rod along the lever to vary its movement. Unfortunately, in all\r\narrangements of this sort, the plunger comes to a reluctant and weary\r\nstop, as the roller of the lifter rounds the nose of the cam. When the\r\nmovement does finally end, the injection does not necessarily stop, as\r\nthe compressed fuel in the injection pipe is still left to dribble\r\nmiserably into the combustion chamber. To minimize this defect, the\r\ndesigner has placed the pump and injector together in a single unit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--Mechanism for retarding valve and\r\nfuel-injection timing during starting (see also fig. 26). U.S. Navy\r\ntest, 1931. (Smithsonian photo A48324E.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31.--Upper--valve and fuel injector cam;\r\nlower--fuel-injector cam used for starting. U.S. Navy test, 1931.\r\n(Smithsonian photo A48325.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting System: On November 1, 1961, C. H. Wiegman, vice president of\r\nengineering of the Lycoming Division of Avco Corporation wrote to the\r\nMuseum in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     Early in the development it became quite evident that cold starting\r\n     was a problem. This was finally worked out by Packard through the\r\n     use of glow plugs and speeding up the injectors during the cranking\r\n     period. It had been felt that during the slow cranking process we\r\n     were not vaporizing the fuel through the nozzles and that if we\r\n     could speed up the injection pumps during this period of cranking a\r\n     better vaporization could be obtained. Our tests showed that we\r\n     were right, and that the engine could be started quite easily at\r\n     minus 10° F through the use of glow plugs. The method used for\r\n     speeding up the injection pumps was accomplished by utilizing a\r\n     crankshaft cam during the cranking period. The starter would shift\r\n     the running cam out of position allowing the crankshaft cam to take\r\n     over. After the engine fired, the starter was disengaged and the\r\n     running injector pump cam would assume its original position. The\r\n     starting cam would be run at engine speed during cranking, and the\r\n     running cam at 1/8 reverse engine speed during engine operation.\r\n     The shifting was accomplished by a pin-in-slot and spring\r\n     arrangement to change the indexing of the cams to starting position\r\n     and return.\r\n\r\n     An Eclipse electric starter with an oversized flywheel was used....\r\n     This was powered by a double-sized battery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n\r\nAir Shutters: The first engines had no provision for throttling the\r\nintake air. This allowed the engine to run on its own lubricating oil\r\nwhen the throttle was in idle position. As a result the engine idled too\r\nfast, thereby causing either excessive taxiing speeds or rapid brake\r\nwear. This inability to idle slowly also caused high landing speeds\r\nsince the propeller did not turn slowly enough to act as an airbrake.\r\nFigure 1 shows the first model. Note that the tubular air intakes on top\r\nof the cylinders have no valves. Figure 32 shows a later model. Note the\r\nbutterfly valves in the U-shaped air intakes. Here they are shown fully\r\nopened. When the throttle was placed in idle position these valves\r\nautomatically closed and prevented air from flowing past them. Air could\r\nthen only enter from the back of the intakes. Since less air could flow\r\ninto the cylinders, the force of their explosions was reduced, which, in\r\nturn, lowered the idling revolutions per minute. Figure 28 shows a\r\ncylinder from a more advanced model. Note the circular opening between\r\nthe air intake and the intake/exhaust housing. A barrel type of valve\r\nfitted into this opening. One of these valves can be seen just below and\r\nto the left of the cylinder. When the throttle was placed in idle\r\nposition this valve rotated to a position which cut off almost all of\r\nthe airflow into its cylinder. This increased the vacuum formed toward\r\nthe end of the intake stroke, thereby causing more resistance, which\r\nreduced the idling rpm to that of a gasoline engine.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32.--Front left view of engine from Packard Motor\r\nCar Co. 50-hour test, 1930, showing butterfly valve type venturi\r\nthrottles. (Smithsonian photo A48325E.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33.--Front left view of engine from U.S. Navy\r\ntest, 1931, showing spiral oil cooler. (Smithsonian photo A48324A.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCrankcase: It was strengthened by having external ribs added. Note the\r\ncontrast between the first engine, figure 2, and a later model, figure\r\n32.\r\n\r\nOil Cooler: The drum-shaped honeycombed cooler was replaced by a spiral\r\npipe type located between the engine cowl and the crankcase. Figure 3\r\nshows an example of the former type of cooler located at the top of the\r\nengine between two of the cylinders. Figure 33 illustrates the latter\r\ntype located between the cowling and the crankcase.\r\n\r\nCylinder Fastening: Early models had their cylinders strapped and bolted\r\nto the crankcase. Later ones had them only strapped. Figure 2 shows a\r\nbolt-fastened clamp between two of the cylinders on the first engine.\r\nFigure 19 shows a later model without any bolts holding down the\r\ncylinders.\r\n\r\nPistons: The pistons used in the 1929 engine had one compression ring\r\nand one oil scraper ring above the piston pin, and one oil scraper ring\r\nbelow it. There were three grooves, two above the piston pin, and one\r\nbelow it.[17] Pistons used in 1930 had two compression rings, one oil\r\nscraper ring above the piston pin, and one oil scraper ring below it.\r\nThere were four grooves, three above the piston pin, and one below\r\nit.[18] The 1931 pistons had one compression ring above the piston pin,\r\nand one compression ring and four oil scraper rings below it. There were\r\nfour grooves, one above the piston pin, and three below it.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34.--Modified pistons after endurance run. U.S.\r\nNavy test, 1931. (Smithsonian photo A48325D.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCombustion Chamber: In 1931 the contour of the cylinder head was changed\r\nslightly. This improved the combustion efficiency to the extent that the\r\nstroke of the fuel pumps could be decreased about 15 percent. The\r\nspecific fuel consumption then decreased about 10 percent. In addition\r\nthe compression ratio was reduced from 16:1 to 14:1.[20]\r\n\r\nThese changes were designed to eliminate smoke from the exhaust at\r\ncruising speed, and to reduce it at wide-open throttle.\r\n\r\nValves: A two-valve-per-cylinder model was built, but not put into\r\nproduction. It featured more horsepower (300), a higher rate of\r\nrevolutions per minute (2000), and a better specific fuel consumption\r\n(about .35 lb/hp/hr).[21]\r\n\r\nCapt. Woolson designed the production model with a single large valve\r\nfor each cylinder. This was done in order to shorten the development\r\nperiod, for it is easier to design a single valve which serves both the\r\nintake and exhaust functions than one valve for each function. Not only\r\nare there fewer parts, but more important, there are no heat-dissipating\r\nproblems. Although the single valve is heated when it releases the\r\nexhaust gases, it is immediately cooled by the incoming air of the next\r\ncycle. This cooling advantage is not shared by a valve which only passes\r\nexhaust gases.[22]\r\n\r\nCylinder Head: Ribs were added to increase its rigidity (compare fig. 32\r\nwith fig. 33).\r\n\r\nEngine Size: A 400-hp model was developed in 1930. It was not put into\r\nproduction.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n\r\nComments of Aeronautical Engineers: These comments appeared in\r\n_Aviation_ for February 15, 1930, just a month before the Packard diesel\r\nreceived its approved-type certificate. They were in answer to the\r\nquestion, \"What is your opinion of the probable early future of the\r\ncompression ignition type of engine in aircraft powerplants?\" Most of\r\nthe engineers were enthusiastic about the diesel engine's future in\r\naviation; however, neither George J. Mead nor C. Fayette Taylor shared\r\ntheir colleagues' opinions. Mead's prophesy was accurate except for his\r\ndiscounting the diesel's role in lighter-than-air craft. Taylor was\r\ncorrect in implying that there was a future for the diesel in powering\r\nairships.\r\n\r\nGeorge J. Mead (vice president and technical director, Pratt & Whitney\r\nAircraft Company):\r\n\r\n     Compared with the present Otto cycle engine, the Diesel powerplant\r\n     weight, including fuel for a long-distance flight, would apparently\r\n     be less. It is doubtful whether there would be any saving if the\r\n     orthodox engine were operated on a more suitable fuel. Inherently\r\n     the Diesel engine must stand higher pressures and therefore is\r\n     heavier per horsepower. A partial solution of this difficulty is\r\n     the two-cycle operation, which seems almost a requirement if the\r\n     Diesel cycle is to be considered at all for aircraft. For any\r\n     normal commercial operation in the United States there seems to be\r\n     little or no improvement to be had from the Diesel. After all, it\r\n     is not entirely a question of fuel cost but payloads carried for a\r\n     given horsepower. It seemed at one time as though the Diesel was\r\n     particularly desirable for Zeppelin work. Now that blau gas has\r\n     been introduced, which obviates the need of valving precious\r\n     lifting gas, the Diesel cycle seems much less interesting for this\r\n     purpose. There may be a reduction in fire hazard and radio\r\n     interference with the Diesel cycle, but it is doubtful whether it\r\n     will be used in view of these considerations alone.\r\n\r\nC. Fayette Taylor (professor of aeronautical engineering, Massachusetts\r\nInstitute of Technology): \"I believe that the compression ignition\r\nengine will continue to remain in the experimental stage during the year\r\n1930. I should expect its first really practical installation to be in\r\nlighter-than-air craft.\"\r\n\r\nP. B. Taylor (acting chief engineer, Wright Aeronautical Corporation):\r\n\"I believe the compression ignition engine is probably the type which\r\nwill eventually supersede the present electric ignition units. This\r\ndevelopment will come slowly and will not be a solid injection engine.\"\r\n\r\nHenry M. Mullinnix (former chief of powerplant section, Navy Bureau of\r\nAeronautics):\r\n\r\n     The advantages of compression-ignition, including reduced fire\r\n     hazard, more efficient cycle, elimination of electrical apparatus\r\n     and hence of radio interference, elimination of carburetion\r\n     problems, and other benefits less evident, would seem to outweigh\r\n     the difficulties encountered in metering and injecting minute\r\n     quantities of fuel at the proper instant. Although the Diesel\r\n     engine suffers upon comparison with the Otto cycle engine in\r\n     flexibility there seems to be a definite field for employment of\r\n     Diesels and a gradual extension of their use may be predicted.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Geisse (chief engineer, Comet Engine Corporation): \"I am firmly\r\nconvinced that the Diesel engine in the future will not only maintain\r\nthe advantages of Diesel engines as they are now known, but will also be\r\nlighter in pounds per horsepower than the present Otto engines.\"\r\n\r\nLt. Cdr. C. G. McCord (U.S. Navy, Naval Aircraft Factory): \"The use of\r\ncompression ignition in due time appears to be assured; but increase in\r\nweights above those of present Otto cycle engines, to insure\r\nreliability, must be expected.\"\r\n\r\nL. M. Woolson (aeronautical engineer, Packard Motor Car Company): \"There\r\nis no question that the compression ignition aircraft engine will in\r\ntime offer severe competition to the gasoline engine. There are,\r\nhowever, many basic problems to be solved for the solution of which\r\nthere exists no precedent.\"\r\n\r\nN. N. Tilley (chief engineer, Kinner Airplane and Motor Corp.):\r\n\r\n     Considerable development of the compression ignition type of engine\r\n     for aircraft will be required before it is commonly available. It\r\n     is believed that the weight per horsepower must be equal to, or\r\n     less than, that of the present type of engines, in order to\r\n     interest the public, since rapid take-off, rate of climb, and speed\r\n     are desired, rather than low fuel consumption or high mileage. Most\r\n     flights are of few hours duration. It is believed that flights must\r\n     be of over five or six hours duration in order to show any\r\n     advantage of Diesel engines (with low fuel consumption) if\r\n     appreciably heavier than present engines. Also the difference\r\n     between Otto cycle and Diesel becomes slight as the compression\r\n     ratios come closer together.\r\n\r\nComments of Flight Crews: The preceding comments were made by engineers\r\nthinking primarily of the commercial possibilities of the diesel.\r\nFollowing are comments by flight crewmembers about the operating\r\ncharacteristics of the Packard diesel. The former were largely\r\noptimistic. Most of them were only familiar with the aeronautical diesel\r\nas a design project and therefore did not have the practical experience\r\nnecessary to understand all of its limitations. The latter were\r\npessimistic, as they knew firsthand various shortcomings of the engine\r\nwhich only became apparent when it was operated.\r\n\r\nClarence D. Chamberlin, pioneer pilot:\r\n\r\n     My only experience with the Packard diesel was in a Lockheed \"Vega\"\r\n     which I owned back about 1932. The Wright J-5 had been replaced\r\n     with the 225 hp Packard Diesel. My main complaint was the excessive\r\n     fumes. When I would come home at night my wife would greet me with,\r\n     \"You have been flying that oil burner again.\" It was so bad that\r\n     passengers' clothing would smell like a smoky oil stove for hours\r\n     after a flight.\r\n\r\n     Looking backward, it is my guess that the Diesel would have had\r\n     only a limited period of acceptance even if all mistakes had been\r\n     avoided. It is easier and cheaper to get performance with lighter\r\n     and more powerful engines and longer runways than by refining the\r\n     airplane. Fuel economy of an engine has ceased to be the deciding\r\n     factor. Higher utilization of a high speed Jet at least in part\r\n     offsets the inefficient use of fuel. The only time the Diesel had a\r\n     chance was from the middle 20's perhaps on thru WW-2 for certain\r\n     things due to gasoline shortage. To sum it up, the thing that\r\n     licked them worst was the use of a single valve for inlet and\r\n     exhaust making it impossible to collect and keep the fumes out of\r\n     the fuselage.[24]\r\n\r\nRuth Nichols, prominent aviatrix:\r\n\r\n     I was flying Chamberlin's diesel-powered Lockheed, in which a month\r\n     before I had made an official altitude record for both men and\r\n     women in aircraft powered by an engine of that type. The record, I\r\n     believe, still holds. It was a rugged, dependable plane whose\r\n     experimental oil-burning engine nevertheless had a number of bugs.\r\n     For one thing, it was constantly blowing out glow-plugs used for\r\n     warming the fuel mixture, and when that happened long white plumes\r\n     of smoke would stream out, giving spectators the impression that\r\n     the ship was on fire. For another, the vibration was so bad that\r\n     out of 10 standard instruments on the plane, 7 were broken from the\r\n     jarring before my return. The diesel fuel also produced a strong\r\n     odor in the cockpit, the fumes so permeating my luggage and clothes\r\n     that my public appearances during the tour always were highly and\r\n     not very agreeably aromatic. Having a strong stomach, I soon became\r\n     accustomed to the fumes, but another pilot who ferried the plane\r\n     between cities for me on one occasion ... was almost overcome. On\r\n     arrival he said, \"I wouldn't fly that oil burner another mile.\"[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 35.--Ford 11-AT-1 Trimotor, 1930, with 3 Packard\r\n225-hp DR-980 diesel engines, right side view of right engine nacelle.\r\n(Smithsonian photo A48311.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Totten,[26] airplane mechanic:\r\n\r\n     The Ford Trimotor was the poorest of the lot. It was inherently\r\n     noisy and slow, and with the Packards installed it was on the point\r\n     of being underpowered. It was almost impossible to synchronize the\r\n     three engines, and the beat was almost unbearable. It was not flown\r\n     much but it made a fine conversation piece standing on the airport\r\n     apron....\r\n\r\n     The Waco taperwing developed the unnerving habit of breaking flying\r\n     and landing wires from the vibration, and most of the time sat on\r\n     the hangar floor with its wings drooping like a sick pigeon. In\r\n     flight the open cockpit filled with exhaust smoke and unburned fuel\r\n     and the pilot would land after an hour's flight looking like an\r\n     Indianapolis 500 Mile Race driver....\r\n\r\n     The Stinson \"Detroiter,\" the Bellanca \"Pacemaker\" and the\r\n     Buhl-Verville \"Airsedan\" were the most successful ships and were\r\n     the most used. The \"Airsedan,\" in which Woolson was killed, was his\r\n     favorite ship, and the one I believe that was the most flown.\r\n\r\nThe Towle TA-3 amphibian flew beautifully, but not for long. It never\r\ngot a chance to do much as it was a victim of the depression. The Towle\r\nwas powered by 2 Packard diesels on loan from the Packard Motor Car\r\nCompany. It was built of corrugated aluminum exactly like the Ford\r\nTrimotor. As a matter of fact, Towle had been employed by Ford until\r\nFord cancelled airplane building. Towle got his airplane built at the\r\nhangar on Grosse Isle in Detroit, and ran out of money during the flight\r\ntesting program. He now looked for money to continue with and found a\r\nbacker in the person of one Doctor Adams, a widely advertised \"Painless\r\nDentist\" of Detroit. Adams wanted a quicker return on his money than the\r\naverage backer and he insisted that Towle put the airplane in service so\r\nit could start earning some money. At this time the amphibian was\r\nbeginning to become popular for intercity flying, especially around the\r\nGreat Lakes region as all of the major cities were located on the\r\nwaterfront. What was more natural than an airline flying passengers\r\nright into the downtown area of a city? Thompson was doing it between\r\nDetroit and Cleveland, Marquette was doing it between Detroit and\r\nMilwaukee, so Adams applied for permission to operate an airplane\r\nbetween Detroit and Cleveland and other cities on the lakes. In those\r\ndays it was necessary to prove an airplane's reliability by flying a\r\ncertain number of trips over the proposed route with a simulated\r\npayload. This payload was supposed to consist of sand bags, but usually\r\nconsisted of any mechanic or pilot who happened to be loose at the\r\nmoment, and who had nerve enough to go along. Mechanics were easier to\r\nload and unload than sand bags.\r\n\r\nThe Towle was in the middle of the qualification flights, and the\r\npublicity began to appear about the new airline. Much newsprint was\r\ndevoted to the fact that the Towle was powered by the new Packard diesel\r\nengine, and this, of course, made it the only safe airline since all its\r\ncompetitors were using the old-fashioned dangerous gasoline. On the last\r\npayload trip of the Towle the pilot asked me if I wanted to go along,\r\nand of course I was delighted. I neglected to mention that I had been\r\nhired by the Adams airline as a mechanic because of my experience in\r\nrepairing the corrugated skin of the Ford Trimotor owned by my employer,\r\nthe Knowles Flying Service. The mere fact that I did many repairs to the\r\nairframe did not preclude me from getting my share of the engine work\r\ntoo, and since I was already familiar with the Packard diesel, I was\r\nquickly hired by Dr. Adams.\r\n\r\nThe last flight was indeed the last flight. We took off from the Detroit\r\nCity Airport and when we crossed the Detroit river the pilot decided to\r\nland at the Solvay Coal Company docks and fuel up for the opening of the\r\nairline the next day. The Solvay Coal Company was the only place in\r\nDetroit where diesel fuel was obtainable at the time and all of the\r\ndiesel powered yachts got fuel there. The pilot was not too experienced\r\nin the operation of amphibians, and he put the wheels down as we\r\napproached the river. When we hit the water the airplane went over on\r\nits back and sunk to the bottom. It came up to the surface again, and\r\nwe all climbed out onto the keel, and waited for rescue. A police boat\r\ncame over and took us to the dock. The police sent us to the hospital\r\nand then went back and towed the airplane over to the shipyard next door\r\nto Solvay. While we were at the hospital, the crane man hooked onto the\r\nTowle and lifted it out of the water and gently set it down on the dock.\r\nHe was only trying to help, but he inadvertently set it down on its back\r\ninstead of its wheels. That was the end of the Adams airline. The\r\nPackard Company took back their engines. I helped remove them the next\r\nday. We dismantled the airplane and trucked it back to the airport where\r\nit sat in a state of neglect for some time. The pilot was fired, I lost\r\nmy job, and Towle lost his airplane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\n\r\nA Packard diesel advertisement which appeared in _Aero Digest_ for June\r\n1930 stated that this engine had three major advantages over its\r\ngasoline rivals: Greater reliability because of extreme simplicity of\r\ndesign; greater economy because of lower fuel cost plus lower fuel\r\nconsumption, permitting greater payloads with longer range of flight;\r\nand greater safety because of removal of the fire hazard through the use\r\nof fire-safe fuel and absence of electrical ignition equipment.\r\n\r\nThese were the engine's principal advantages. Others are analyzed here\r\nby the author in order of their importance. At low altitudes the diesel\r\nuses an excess of air to eliminate a smoking exhaust; consequently at\r\nhigh altitudes, where the air is less dense, the diesel is still able to\r\nmaintain much of its power. In contrast, the carburetored gasoline\r\nengine is sensitive to the fuel-air ratio and thus has no surplus air\r\navailable at higher altitudes. A malfunctioning carburetor could cause a\r\ngasoline engine to cease operating, but an inoperative fuel injector\r\nwould cause the Packard diesel to lose one ninth of its power, since\r\neach cylinder had its own independently operating injector. In practice,\r\nhowever, because of the excessive vibration, the engine was generally\r\nshut off immediately after a cylinder cut out.[27] Shielding was\r\nunnecessary because the diesel had no electrical ignition system.\r\nCarburetor icing was an impossibility because there was no carburetor.\r\n\r\nAny excess lubricating oil in a diesel engine's cylinder is consumed\r\ncleanly to produce power. By contrast, such oil in a gasoline engine's\r\ncylinder is only partly burned. As a result carbon deposits form that\r\neventually cause malfunctioning of the spark plugs, valves, and\r\ncombustion chambers. This advantage accrued to the diesel because it\r\nutilized an excess of air, and in addition its cylinder walls were\r\nhotter. The engine was very clean-running from the standpoint of oil\r\nleakage. This was a safety factor since it eliminated the possibility of\r\na fire starting on the outside surfaces of the engine, and in addition\r\nit saved the time and money that was normally spent cleaning\r\nengines.[28] Since the diesel utilized its heat of combustion more\r\nefficiently than the gasoline engine, its cooling fin area could be\r\nreduced by 35 percent. This permitted better streamlining. Having less\r\ncooling fin area, it warmed up more rapidly than a gasoline engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The PACKARD-DIESEL AIRCRAFT ENGINE\r\n\r\nFire-Safe Fuel\r\n\r\n_Furnaces in many a home burn similar oil_\r\n\r\n_A lighted match cannot ignite or explode it_\r\n\r\n_Saturated cloth can burn only like a wick_\r\n\r\n_And the oil itself will quench this fire_\r\n\r\n_But only when property atomized the spray may be ignited_\r\n\r\nGraphic Proof of fuel safety in the Packard-Diesel Aircraft Engine\r\n\r\nFigure 36.--Advertisement emphasizing the advantages of fire-safe fuel.\r\n(Smithsonian photo A48848.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the greater simplicity, it was more practical to build a large\r\ndiesel than a large gasoline engine. Large airplanes would therefore\r\nneed fewer engines if diesel powered. Smaller fuel tanks could be used\r\nbecause of the greater fuel economy of the diesel, and also because of\r\nthe high specific gravity of fuel oil as compared to gasoline.\r\nFurthermore, these smaller tanks could be placed in more convenient\r\nlocations. Not having a carburetor the engine could not backfire,\r\nfurther reducing the fire hazard. The exhaust note was lower because of\r\nthe diesel's higher expansion ratio. The absence of an ignition system\r\npermitted the diesel to operate in the heaviest types of precipitation.\r\nSuch conditions might cause the ignition system of a gasoline engine to\r\nmalfunction. The Packard diesel was flown at times without exhaust\r\nstacks or manifolds; this was practical from a safety standpoint because\r\nof the diesel's lower exhaust temperature due to its higher expansion\r\nratio. Elimination of these parts reduced the weight and cost of the\r\nengine installation. Finally, the engine was ideal for aerobatics, since\r\nthe injectors, unlike carburetors, would work equally well whether right\r\nside up or upside down.\r\n\r\nAn advantage peculiar to the Packard among aeronautical diesels was its\r\nlight weight. The English Beardmore \"Tornado III\" weighed 6.9 lb/hp, and\r\nthe German Junkers SL-1 (FO-4) weighed 3.1 lb/hp, while the Packard\r\nweighed but 2.3 lb/hp. In fairness to the Beardmore, it was the only one\r\nof the three engines designed for airship use, and part of its heaviness\r\nwas due to the special requirements of lighter-than-air craft. A\r\ncontemporary and comparable American gasoline engine, the Lycoming\r\nR-680, weighed 2.2 lb/hp. To have designed a diesel aircraft engine as\r\nlight as a gasoline one was a remarkable achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisadvantages\r\n\r\nThere are four main reasons why the Packard diesel was not successful.\r\nFirst the Packard Motor Car Company put the engine into production a\r\nbrief three years after it was created. The only successful airplane\r\ndiesel, the German Junkers \"Jumo,\" was in development more than three\r\ntimes as long (1912-1929). The following tests indicate that the\r\nPackard diesel was not ready for production, and hence was unreliable.\r\n\r\nPackard Motor Car Company 50-Hour Test (Feb. 15-18, 1930): This test was\r\nidentical to the standard Army 50-hour test which was used for the\r\ngranting of the Approved Type Certificate. The engine tested was\r\nnumbered 100, and was the first to be made with production tools\r\n(approximately half a dozen engines had been handmade previously). It\r\nhad to be stopped three times, twice due to failure of the fuel pump\r\nplunger springs and once due to the loosening of the oil connection\r\nring. These failures were attributed to manufacturing discrepancies. In\r\naddition, 4 out of a total of 103 valve springs broke.[29]\r\n\r\nU.S. Navy 50-Hour Test (Jan. 22, 1931, to March 15, 1931): The engine\r\nused in the Navy test was numbered 120. (Apparently only 20 production\r\nengines had been built during the preceding 12 months; Dorner in a\r\nletter of March 3, 1962, states that the total number of Packard diesels\r\nproduced was approximately 25.) The engine had to be stopped three\r\ntimes, twice due to valve-spring collar failures and once due to a valve\r\nhead breaking. Because of these failures this test was not completed.\r\nThe following significant quotations have been extracted from the test:\r\n\"The engine is not recommended for service use.... Flight tests, until\r\nthe durability of the engine is improved, be limited to a determination\r\nof the critical engine speeds, and to short hops in seaplanes.... It is\r\nbelieved that this size engine should be made suitable for service use\r\nbefore this type in a larger class is attempted.\" This latter statement\r\nprobably refers to the 400-hp model.\r\n\r\nA year had passed between the making of engine 100 and 120, yet the\r\nreliability had not improved. Although unreliability was the immediate\r\ncause of failure, there were two design defects which would have doomed\r\nthe engine even if it had been reliable. All the Packard diesels were of\r\nthe 4-stroke cycle unblown type, yet the most successful airplane\r\ndiesels were of the 2-stroke cycle blown type.[30] The advantages of the\r\nlatter type for aeronautical use are that it is of a more compact\r\nengine, of lower weight and greater efficiency.[31] The engine was\r\ntherefore built around the wrong cycle.\r\n\r\nThe Packard diesel of 1928 was designed to compete with the Wright J-5\r\n\"Whirlwind\" which powered Lindbergh's \"Spirit of St. Louis\" in 1927.[32]\r\nThe specifications were within two percent of each other. The diesel\r\nengine's fuel consumption was far less although its price was\r\nconsiderably higher.\r\n\r\n                                      _Packard Diesel_    _Wright J-5_\r\n                                      _DR-980_            _\"Whirlwind\"_\r\n\r\n  Diameter (in.)                      45-11/16                 45\r\n  Horsepower                          225                      225\r\n  Weight (lb)                         510                      510\r\n  Weight-horsepower ratio             2.26                     2.26\r\n  Fuel consumption (lb per hp/hr at   0.40                     0.60\r\n    cruising).\r\n  Cost                                $4025                    $3000\r\n\r\nThe advantages of lower fuel cost and greater cruising range offered by\r\nthe diesel engine would be relatively unimportant to a private pilot\r\nflying for pleasure, but would be vital to the commercial operator using\r\nairplanes powered by engines having several times the horsepower of the\r\nPackard diesel. Its size, moreover, was too small for the technology of\r\nfuel injectors.[33] The Packard Company realized that the production\r\nengine was too small.[34] In 1930 a 400-hp version was built but was not\r\nput into production, probably because of the unreliability of the 225-hp\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\nThe fourth principal reason why the engine failed is explained by the\r\nfollowing quotation from _The Propulsion of Aircraft_, by M. J. B. Davy\r\n(published in 1936 by His Majesty's Stationery Office, London):\r\n\r\n     Although the development and adoption for transport purposes of the\r\n     relatively high-speed compression ignition engine has been rapid\r\n     during the last few years, there has been no corresponding advance\r\n     in its adoption for aircraft propulsion. A reason for this is the\r\n     recent great advance in \"take-off\" power in the petrol (gasoline)\r\n     engine due to the introduction of 87 octane fuel (which permits\r\n     higher compression ratios) and the strong probability of 100 octane\r\n     fuels in the near future, still further increasing this power. The\r\n     need for increased take-off power results from the higher wing\r\n     loading necessitated by the modern demand for commercial aircraft\r\n     with higher cruising speeds with reasonable power expenditure.\r\n\r\nProduction of the Packard diesel ceased in 1933. During that same year\r\nthe Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company and the Wright Aeronautical\r\nCorporation specified 87-octane fuel for certain of their engines. Less\r\nthan 10 years later octane ratings had increased to over 100, putting\r\nthe diesel at a further disadvantage.[35]\r\n\r\nAlthough the above disadvantages sealed the Packard diesel's fate, there\r\nwere other minor reasons for its failure. The Packard diesel had the\r\nhighest maximum cylinder pressure (up to 1500 psi at peak rpm) of any\r\nproven contemporary aircraft diesel engine. Leigh M. Griffith, vice\r\npresident and general manager, Emsco Aero Engine Company, had this to\r\nsay about the Packard diesel's high maximum cylinder pressure in the\r\nSeptember 1930 _S.A.E. Journal_:\r\n\r\n     The designers considered it necessary to adopt unusual but\r\n     admittedly clever expedients to counteract the great torque\r\n     irregularity caused by the excessive maximum pressure. The adoption\r\n     of the lower pressure of 800 lbs. would have eliminated the\r\n     necessity for the pivoted spring-mounted counterweights and the\r\n     shock-absorbing rubber propeller-drive.... The use of such high\r\n     pressures is in reality the quick and easy way to secure high-speed\r\n     operation and can be justified only from this standpoint, although\r\n     the resulting increased difficulty in keeping the engine light\r\n     enough was a strong offsetting factor.[36]\r\n\r\n     Insofar as the engine life was concerned it is true that 1,500-psi\r\n     peak pressures were observed but the engine was so developed to\r\n     withstand these pressures.... One of the most severe problems\r\n     connected with the development of this engine was the piston ring\r\n     sealing. Special compression rings were made with no gaps and\r\n     further work in this respect could have been used to advantage had\r\n     the engine been kept in production.[37]\r\n\r\nIt is significant that in 1930 the Packard diesel had a compression\r\nratio of 16:1, whereas in 1931 it has been reduced to 14:1. This was\r\nprobably done to reduce vibration and the problem of piston-ring\r\nsealing.[38] The exhaust products had an unpleasant odor which was\r\nparticularly objectionable during taxiing. Professor C. Fayette Taylor,\r\nwriting in the January 1931 issue of _Aviation_, remarked about this\r\nfault: \"One is inclined to question whether the disagreeable escaping of\r\nexhaust gas from the intake ports can be overcome, while still retaining\r\nthe obvious advantages in weight and simplicity of the single valve.\"\r\nThe engine exhaust deposited a black oily film. In fact some airplanes\r\nfitted with the Packard diesel engine were painted black, so that soot\r\ndeposits from the exhaust would not be noticed.[39] Since the\r\npassengers' and pilots' compartments were generally located behind the\r\nengines, and were not airtight, damage to clothing resulted. This fault\r\ncould have been eliminated by the use of separate valves for the intake\r\nand exhaust systems.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible to start the engine when the temperature dropped\r\nmuch below 32° F unless glow plugs were used. These spark-plug-like\r\ndevices, which were only used for starting, had resistance windings\r\nwhich glowed continuously when turned on. The additional heat glow plugs\r\nprovided made starting an easy matter in the coldest weather; however,\r\nthey complicated the design of an engine noted for its simplicity, and\r\nthey used so much electricity that only a long flight would allow the\r\ngenerator to fully recharge the battery.\r\n\r\nH. R. Ricardo, writing in the June 4, 1930, issue of _The Aeroplane_\r\nsaid: \"Referring to the very fine achievement of the Packard Company of\r\nAmerica in producing a small radial air-cooled heavy-oil engine, a\r\npetrol engine of similar design and with the same margin of safety would\r\nweigh less than 1-1/2 lbs. per hp.\" The important point made is that a\r\ngasoline engine designed along the same lines as the Packard diesel\r\nwould weigh considerably less, but would then suffer from the Packard's\r\nreduced structural safety factor. It is significant that as the Packard\r\ndeveloped, it became heavier.[40]\r\n\r\nLike other diesels, the Packard cost more to build than a comparable\r\ngasoline engine, because of the type of construction required for the\r\ndiesel's higher maximum cylinder pressures and the difficulty of\r\nmachining the fuel injectors. Having fuel injectors, the engine was more\r\nsensitive to dirt in the fuel system than a carburetor-equipped\r\ngasoline engine.[41] The fuel injectors were \"a crude and deficient\r\nmechanism\" subject to rapid wear, and often these injectors caused\r\nsmoking exhausts and high fuel consumptions.[42] In the event of battery\r\nor starter failure, a comparable gasoline engine could be started by\r\nswinging the propeller. Because of the engine's high compression, it\r\nwould have been impossible to have hand-started a Packard diesel this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the Air Museum, January 15, 1962, Dorner commented:\r\n\"During my first demonstration (of high-speed diesel engines) in 1926 in\r\nCalifornia and later in Detroit I learned from Capt. Woolson that the\r\nlarge transport airlines were controlled by oil companies which were not\r\ninterested in (supplying) two different kinds of aircraft fuel, and in\r\nsavings of fuel.\" The May issue of _Aero Digest_ had a full-page\r\nillustrated advertisement titled \"Announcing National Distribution for\r\nTexaco Aerodiesel Fuel.\" Although distribution was limited, the American\r\noil industry did not prevent the airplane diesel from becoming a success\r\nin the civil market. However, it is significant that the advertisement\r\nwas placed by Frank Hawks of the Texas Company largely as a gesture of\r\nfriendship to Woolson.[43]\r\n\r\nThe situation in the military market was different, however, as\r\ntestified by this quotation from the same letter. \"The military\r\nadministration, having paid all of the expenses for the testing period\r\nto that date (1931), came after the tests to the conclusion that the\r\nadvantages of the diesel as compared to its disadvantages did not\r\njustify the great risk to procure and distribute two different kinds of\r\nfuel in case of war.\"\r\n\r\nTwo accidents, which received wide publicity and no doubt did\r\nconsiderable harm to the entire project, occurred to Packard\r\ndiesel-powered airplanes. The following quotation is from the _Herald\r\nTribune_ for April 23, 1930: \"Attica, New York--Losing their bearings in\r\na blinding snowstorm and mistaking the side of a snow-covered hill for a\r\nsuitable landing place, three men, one of them Capt. Lionel M. Woolson,\r\naeronautical engineer for the Packard Motor Company and adapter of the\r\ndiesel engine to airplanes, were killed here today.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 37.--Interior of Bellanca, showing Parker D.\r\nCramer, pilot (left), and Oliver L. Paquette, radio operator, just\r\nbefore taking off from Detroit, Michigan, on July 28, 1931. (Smithsonian\r\nphoto A202.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second of these accidents is described in the September 1931 issue\r\nof _U.S. Air Services_:\r\n\r\n     Columbus wanted to sail west beyond the limits set by the learned\r\n     navigators of his time, and in much the same consuming fashion\r\n     Parker D. Cramer wanted to show his generation and posterity that\r\n     a subarctic air route to Europe via Canada, Greenland, Iceland,\r\n     Norway, and Denmark was feasible.... On July 27, without any\r\n     preliminary announcement, Cramer left Detroit in a Diesel-engined\r\n     Bellanca, and following the course he took with Bert Hassel three\r\n     years ago, he flew first to Cochrane, on Hudson Bay. His next stop\r\n     was Great Whales and then Wakeham Bay. From there he flew to\r\n     Pangnirtum, Baffin Land, and across the Hudson Straits to\r\n     Holsteinborg, Greenland. He crossed the icecap at a point farther\r\n     north than the routes that have been discussed heretofore, but\r\n     almost on the most direct or Great Circle route from Detroit to\r\n     Copenhagen. He was accompanied by Oliver Paquette, radio operator.\r\n     They were on their way more than a week before they were\r\n     discovered. To Iceland, to the Faroe Islands, to the Shetlands.\r\n\r\n     They were taxiing across the little harbor of Lerwick, Shetland\r\n     Islands, when a messenger from the bank waved a yellow paper. It\r\n     was a warning of gales on the coast east to Copenhagen. Cramer\r\n     apparently thought it was an enthusiastic bon voyage, and, after\r\n     circling the town, flew away. A Swedish radio station reported a\r\n     faint \"Hello, Hello, Hello\" in English, but the plane was not seen\r\n     again.\r\n\r\nAs the result of a personal conversation with his brother, William A.\r\nCramer, in 1964, the author learned that the fuselage and floats of the\r\nairplane were found six weeks later. Since there was no indication of a\r\nheavy impact (not a single glass dial on the instrument panel was\r\nbroken), a successful landing must have been made. Several weeks later,\r\na package was found wrapped in a torn oilskin containing instruments,\r\nmaps, and a personal letter, all substantiating the evidence that the\r\nlanding was successful. It can only be surmised that there was engine\r\nfailure, probably due to a clogged oil filter.[44]\r\n\r\nOnce before during the trip a forced landing had been made due to engine\r\nmalfunctioning, and a successful takeoff was accomplished in spite of a\r\nmoderately rough sea. This time, however, storm conditions probably made\r\nthe takeoff impossible.\r\n\r\nAs a final summary of the author's analysis of the Packard diesel\r\nengine, it must be emphasized that although the engine burned a much\r\ncheaper and safer fuel more efficiently than any of its gasoline rivals,\r\nit was too unreliable to compete with them. Even if it had been\r\nreliable, it was too small to be useful to the large transport\r\noperators, to whom its fuel economy would have appealed. In addition,\r\nthis mechanism operated on the wrong cycle: 4-stroke, rather than the\r\nlighter, more compact, and more efficient blown 2-stroke cycle. Lastly,\r\nit was doomed by the advent of high octane gasolines, first used while\r\nit was still in the development stage. These new fuels reduced the\r\ndiesel's advantage resulting from low fuel consumption, and, in\r\naddition, gave the gasoline engine a definite advantage from the\r\nstandpoint of performance. The Packard diesel was a daring design but,\r\nfor the reasons analyzed in this chapter, it could not meet this\r\ncompetition, and therefore failed to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Packard to Begin Building Diesel Plane Engines Soon\r\n\r\n_Will Start Construction at Once on New Three Story Factory to Handle\r\nWork_\r\n\r\n[From _Aviation_, March 2, 1929, vol. 26, no. 10]\r\n\r\n\r\nDETROIT, MICH.--Indications that the Diesel type airplane engine,\r\nrecently developed by Capt. L. M. Woolson, chief aeronautical engineer\r\nof the Packard Motor Car Co., will become a commercial reality and\r\npossibly a revolutionary factor in airplane engine design, is seen here\r\nin the announcement of the concern that it will begin construction\r\nimmediately of a $650,000 plant to produce the engines in large quantity\r\nfor the commercial market.\r\n\r\nThe new plant, according to the announcement by Hugh J. Ferry, treasurer\r\nof the Packard firm, will be completed and in operation within five\r\nweeks. Between 600 and 700 men will be employed and, according to\r\nexpectations, production will be carried on at the rate of about 500\r\nDiesel engines per month by July.\r\n\r\nThe Packard Diesel was announced first in October, following experiments\r\ncovering several years. The original engine was placed in a\r\nStinson-Detroiter, which was flown successfully by Captain Woolson and\r\nWalter Lees, Packard pilot. Since that time Captain Woolson has built\r\nfour of the engines, all of 200 hp. capacity, developing 1 hp. for every\r\n2 lb. of weight.\r\n\r\nThe Diesel, installed on the Stinson-Detroiter, it was said, now has had\r\n200 hr. flying time, and gives not the slightest indication that it will\r\nneed an overhauling for some time. The other three engines have been\r\ntested on the block in the company's research plant.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the builders that the Packard Diesel will produce a\r\nsaving of about 20 per cent. in fuel consumption as compared with\r\nengines using gasoline. It is claimed further that the Diesel will\r\nprove far more reliable in construction than any airplane engine yet\r\ndeveloped. Evidence of this, it was pointed out, is seen in the\r\nperformance of the initial Diesel.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETAILS NOT ANNOUNCED\r\n\r\nAlthough neither Mr. Ferry, nor Captain Woolson, would disclose any\r\ntechnical details as to the engine's construction in making it\r\napplicable to airplane use, the secret of its success was reported to be\r\nan especially designed pumping device creating high compression\r\nnecessary for Diesel firing.\r\n\r\nSince announcement of the engine, the Packard factory has been literally\r\na Mecca for engineers from many parts of the world wishing to see the\r\nengine. The Crown Prince of Spain, in Detroit last fall, was given a\r\nflight in the Diesel powered Stinson. None of the construction secrets,\r\nhowever, have been divulged, it was said.\r\n\r\nThe Packard announcement set at rest rumors that the company planned\r\nconstruction of a plant costing several million dollars, as well as\r\nreports that the company was going into the production of airplanes.\r\n\"Our efforts,\" Mr. Ferry said, \"will be confined to the engine, or power\r\nplant end of the aircraft industry. We will continue to build the\r\nwater-cooled type we have been producing for years.\" The new Diesel\r\nplant will be primarily an assembly plant, although some machine work\r\nwill be done there. The bulk of the machine work, however, will be done\r\nin the present Packard machine shops.\r\n\r\nAlthough no approximation of selling price on the new Diesel was\r\ndivulged, it was intimated that the engine will retail at a price\r\ncompetitive with or slightly under the price of present gasoline\r\nconsuming air-cooled engines of that horsepower range. Captain Woolson\r\nwill have complete charge of the Diesel plant, it was announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Effect of Oxygen Boosting on Power and Weight\r\n\r\n[From P. H. SCHWEITZER and E. R. KLINGE, \"Oxygen-Boosting of Diesel\r\nEngines for Take-Off,\" _The Pennsylvania State College Bulletin_ (April\r\n1, 1941), vol. 35, no. 14, p. 25.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Practical Conclusions_\r\n\r\nAirplanes require about one third more power during the take-off than in\r\nflight. In diesel-engined airplanes the size of the engine could be\r\nreduced by 25 percent by feeding oxygen into the intake air during the\r\ntakeoff. Applying the results of the experiments to a transport plane,\r\nFig. 31 shows the possible weight saving with various oxygen boosts. The\r\ncurves are based on 6000 cruising horsepower and an estimated engine\r\nweight of 2 lb per hp.\r\n\r\nFor the take-off 8000 hp are necessary. To supply the additional 2000\r\nhp, 200 lb of oxygen are fed into the intake air during the take-off.\r\nThe volume of 200 lb of liquid oxygen is approximately 20 gal. Standard\r\nliquid air containers of 55 litre capacity weigh 75 lb. Therefore the\r\nweight of the oxygen and container is 350 lb while the possible saving\r\nin engine weight is 4000 lb. The weight per take-off horsepower is\r\nthereby reduced from 2 to 1.54 lb. The calculation is shown in Table 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 38.--Effect of Oxygen Boost on Power and Weight.\r\n(Cruising horsepower 6000, takeoff horsepower 8000.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOxygen addition may be used for starting diesel engines. The raising of\r\nthe oxygen concentration from the normal 21 per cent to 45 per cent was\r\nfound to be equivalent to a raise of approximately 10 cetane numbers as\r\nfar as starting is concerned.\r\n\r\nFive per cent increase in oxygen concentration eliminated exhaust smoke\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nTABLE 1\r\n\r\n  Normal horsepower                                6000\r\n\r\n  Take-off horsepower                              8000\r\n\r\n  Normal fuel consumption                          0.4 lb per hp-hr, or\r\n                                                     53.5 lb per min\r\n  Normal air consumption                           900 lb per min\r\n\r\n  Normal oxygen consumption, 21 per cent oxygen    189 lb per min\r\n    concentration\r\n\r\n  Boosted oxygen consumption, 32 per cent oxygen   289 lb per min\r\n    concentration\r\n\r\n  Oxygen to be supplied                            100 lb per min\r\n\r\n  Weight of 8000-hp engine                         16,000 lb\r\n\r\n  Weight of boosted 6000-hp engine                 12,000 lb\r\n\r\n  Weight of oxygen for 2-min boost                 200 lb\r\n\r\n  Weight of container for 29 lb of liquid oxygen   150 lb\r\n\r\n  Net weight saving by oxygen boost                3650 lb\r\n\r\n  Weight per horsepower, nonboosted engine         2 lb\r\n\r\n  Weight per horsepower, boosted engine            1.54 lb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] Appendix, p. 43.\r\n\r\n[2] Letter, Hermann I.

In doing this it also increases somewhat the\r\namount of fresh air introduced into the cylinders. Woolson invented a\r\n2-stroke cycle blown engine; the patent was issued in 1932 (patent\r\n1853714) with rights assigned to the Packard Motor Car Company. (Woolson\r\nhimself died in 1930.)\r\n\r\n[31] A 2-stroke cycle engine completes 360° of crankshaft rotation in\r\nwhat it takes a 4-stroke cycle engine 720° to accomplish. A 3-cylinder\r\ntwo-stroke cycle engine therefore has the same capacity to do work as a\r\n6-cylinder four-stroke cycle engine. For this reason the former type of\r\nengine is both more compact and lighter than the latter type.\r\n\r\nThe above advantages, plus the increased efficiency of the blown 2-cycle\r\ndiesel, are discussed in _Flight--The Aeronautical Engineer Supplement_\r\n(December 26, 1940), vol. 19, no. 11, pp. 545 and 552.\r\n\r\n[32] Packard advertisement--_Aero Digest_ (June 1930), vol. 16, no. 6,\r\np. 23.\r\n\r\n[33] _Aviation_ (March 15, 1930), vol. 28, no. 11, p. 531.\r\n\r\n[34] _The National Aeronautic Magazine_ (April 1932), vol. 10, no. 4.,\r\np. 18.\r\n\r\n[35] Appendix, p. 47.\r\n\r\n[36] See Woolson's patent 1794047, issued in 1931 and assigned to the\r\nPackard Motor Car Company. \"An object of my invention is to\r\nautomatically regulate the compression ratio in an engine inversely to\r\nthe speed....\" See also his patent 1891321, issued in 1932 and assigned\r\nto the Packard Motor Car Company.

Hatch of the National Air Museum, it is\r\npossible that the engine failed because the fuel injectors became\r\nclogged. He notes that the airplane refueled at several fishing ports,\r\nand therefore must have used diesel oil set aside for fishing boats.\r\nThis oil was generally quite dirty. As a result it was routine for the\r\nfishermen to have to clean engine oil filters frequently enroute. The\r\noil filters of the Packard diesel could not be cleaned in flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nPassages in italics are indicated by _underscore_.\r\n\r\nPassages in bold are indicated by =bold=.\r\n\r\nThe following misprints have been corrected:\r\n  \"crackcase\" corrected to \"crankcase\" (page 16)\r\n  \"is is\" corrected to \"it is\" (page 36)\r\n\r\nOther than the corrections listed above, printer's inconsistencies in\r\nspelling, punctuation, and hyphenation usage have been retained.",
